The mAb were tested against different modified A\u03b2 peptides containing the sequence EVHH partly. The grey labelled peptide A\u03b2pE(11-23) (see spot 10) contains the target sequence with pyroglutamate at N-terminus (pEVHH). Each membrane was spotted with peptides 1-16.

Note that K<sub>D</sub>=1/K<sub>A</sub> and \u0394G = \u0394H - T \u0394S.\nTable 11: Thermodynamic binding parameters of A\u03b2(pE11-18)-PEG peptide at anti A\u03b211(pE) antibodyThe antibody was eluted from protein G column with KSCN-gradient (pH 7.0) and 0.1 M glycine-HCl (pH 2.7), respectively. The parameters were determined by ITC MicroCalorimeter at 20 \u00b0C.Binding parametersAnti A\u03b211(pE) antibodyKSCN elutionglycine-HCl elutionStoichiometry (N)1.88 \u00b1 0.00871.01 \u00b1 0.0015Association constant (K<sub>A</sub>) in 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>12.7 \u00b1 1.199.5 \u00b1 0.52Dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) in nM78.74105.26Binding enthalpy (\u0394H) in kcal/mol-8.259 \u00b1 0,058-7.999 \u00b1 0,026Binding entropy (\u0394S) in cal/mol x K<sup>-1</sup>4.334.64-T\u0394S kcal/mol-1.27-1.36Gibbs energy (\u0394G) in kcal/mol-9.53-9.36</p>At first the results of anti A\u03b211(pE) antibody eluted with KSCN-gradient (pH 7.0) were discussed. The stoichiometry of the antigen and antibody bond was 1.88. So the stoichiometry was almost 2, that means nearly all antibodies were active and interacted with two molecules of A\u03b2(pE11-18)-PEG peptide. The reason for the stoichiometry variation was the inaccurate concentration determinations due to the unknown antibody absorption coefficients. A stoichiometry with significantly less than two would indicate that a part of antibody molecules are inactive, which is in the case for acidic eluted antibody.</p>The dissociation constant of the antibody was 78.74 nM. For example anti-hMCP1 N1pE(1-x) antibody (data not shown) showed a 3-times higher dissociation constant than anti A\u03b211(pE) antibody. That means that the strength of binding of anti A\u03b211(pE) was higher than of anti-hMCP1 N1pE(1-x) antibody. However the anti-hMCP1 N1pE(1-x) was successfully used in MCP1 ELISA, which suggests that the anti A\u03b211(pE) antibody also should show good binding properties in ELISA. The determined dissociation constant of anti A\u03b211(pE) antibody ranged in the middle of described ITC results in literature. For example the interaction of D-PAM (Protein A Mimetic) with monoclonal antibodies IgG showed a K<sub>D</sub> in the range of 10<sup>-5</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> (D'Agostino B. et al., J Immunol Methods. 2008 Apr 20;333(1-2):126-38) and the K<sub>D</sub> of the interaction between soluble monomeric A\u03b2(1-40) and mouse monoclonal antibodies were in the range of 10<sup>-7</sup> to 10<sup>-8</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> (Brockhaus et al., J Phys Chem B. 2007 Feb 8;111(5):1238-43). The K<sub>D</sub> of anti A\u03b211(pE) antibody amounted 7.8 \u00b7 10<sup>-8</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> and was comparable with data described in literature.</p>In general, antibody and antigen interactions are mostly enthalpic driven by hydrogen bonds (specific interaction) and often the entropy change is negative (\u0394S &lt; 0) due to the loss of conformational degrees. But from the bond of A\u03b2(pE11-18)-PEG at anti A\u03b211(pE) antibody resulted an mild entropy gain of \u0394S = 4.33 (cal \u00b7 mol<sup>-1</sup> \u00b7 K<sup>-1</sup>), a negative enthalpy with \u0394H = -8.259 kcal/mol and a low Gibbs energy with \u0394G = - 9.53 kcal/mol. So the interaction was mild enthalpic driven (\u0394H &lt; 0) due to the formation of hydrogen bonds and also mild entropic driven (\u0394S &gt; 0) which is unusual for antibody and antigen interactions. The bond was characterized by hydrophobic interactions due to the strong hydrophobic epitope A\u03b211(pE), water molecules were displaced which resulted in gain of conformational degrees of freedom and so in an mild entropy gain (Ohtaka et al., 2002, Protein Sci. 11, 1908-1916). In contrast, the most antigen and antibody bonds are driven by a negative enthalpy and unfavorable entropy lost e.g. MCP1 N1pE(1-x) antibody.</p>The above described ITC results were performed with antibody purified with protein G sepharose and eluted with KSCN-gradient (see section 2.3). In addition, the antibody elution was tested with acidic 0.1 M glycine-HCl solution (pH 2.7) followed by immediate neutralization with 1 M Tris-HCl, the antibody was precipitated. Before concentration determination the precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation and does not occur within the ITC experiment. The binding parameters of this acidic eluted antibody were also characterized by ITC. Figure 18 shows the obtained binding curve of anti A\u03b211(pE) antibody (eluted with glycine-HCl) with A\u03b2(pE11-18)-PEG whereby the total heat release at each injection is plotted against the molar ratio of antibody and peptide.</p>The results of anti A\u03b211(pE) antibody eluted with glycine-HCl showed a dissociation constant of K<sub>D</sub>= 105.26 nM, a negative enthalpy with \u0394H = -7.99 kcal/mol and a entropy gain of 4.64 (cal \u00b7 mol<sup>-1</sup> \u00b7 K<sup>-1</sup>). The energetic parameters of the acidic and KSCN eluted antibody were nearly the same but in contrast the stoichiometry value of acidic eluted antibody was only 1.01 and so significantly lower than two. That means approx. the half of the antibodies were inactivated due to the acidic elution. In conclusion, the antibody elution was further performed with KSCN-gradient instead with acidic glycine-HCl.</p>Additionally, the biotinylated anti A\u03b211(pE) antibody (see section 1.2.3.1) was also examined in ITC. In Table 12 determined thermodynamic binding parameters are shown.\nTable 12: Thermodynamic binding parameters of A\u03b2(pE11-18)-PEG peptide at biotinylated anti A\u03b211(pE) antibodyThe antibody was biotinylated whereby two biotin molecules were coupled at one antibody. The parameters were determined by ITC MicroCalorimeter at 20 \u00b0C.Biotinylated anti A\u03b211(pE) antibodyStoichiometry (N)1.66 \u00b1 0.0092Association constant (K<sub>A</sub>) in 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>8.0 \u00b1 0.69Dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) in nM125.00Binding enthalpy (\u0394H) in kcal/mol-8.276 \u00b1 0.066Binding entropy (\u0394s) in cal/mol x K<sup>-1</sup>3.36-T\u0394S kcal/mol-0.98Gibbs energy (\u0394G) in kcal/mol-9.26</p>In Figure 19 the obtained binding curve of biotinylated anti A\u03b211(pE) antibody and A\u03b2(pE11-18)-PEG are shown.</p>The results of biotinylated anti A\u03b211(pE) antibody show nearly the same enthalpy and entropy value but a slightly higher dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>= 125 nM) than the non-biotinylated antibody. That means that the binding strength of biotinylated anti A\u03b211(pE) was slightly lower than that of non-biotinylated antibody. Also the stoichiometry with 1.66 was under the stoichiometry of non-biotinylated antibody which possibly showed that a low part of antibody molecules are inactive. Concluding, a slight loss of antibody activity, possibly by the biotinylation process was determined.</p>2.4.5 Determination of cross reactivityThe cross reactivity of anti A\u03b211(pE) antibody (clone 13) to pyroglutamate-peptides CCL2 (known as MCP-1), CCL8 (known as MCP-2), big gastrin, gonadoliberin, neurotensin, orexin A, fibronectin, collagen 1 and TRH (thyrotropin-releasing hormone) was tested via SPR (data not shown). The tested antibody showed no cross reactivity with the several pyroglutamate-peptides. Additionally, the cross reactivity of antibody clone 13 to A\u03b2pE(3-40) and A\u03b2pE(11-30) were tested in SPR, whereby the antibody should be compared concerning its reactivity. In Figure 20 a real-time plot of clone 13 to A\u03b2pE(11-30) and A\u03b2pE(3-40) peptide over time is illustrated.</p>The SPR results indicate that clone 13 showed a weak cross reactivity to A\u03b2pE(3-40) but with 4 magnitudes lower than to A\u03b2pE(11-30). The ITC results (see section 2.4.3) show that the bond between A\u03b211pE and clone 13 was mild entropic driven due to hydrophobic interactions. That means that in general, clone 13 could unspecifically "
