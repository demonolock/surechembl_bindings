    "ion of this sequence (a parent antibody or a parent sequence) by insertion, deletion or substitution of one or more amino acids, or chemical derivatisation of one or more amino acid residues in the amino acid sequence, or nucleotides within the nucleotide sequence, or at either or both of the distal ends of the sequence, e.g. in a CDR sequence the N-terminal and/or C-terminal 1 , 2, 3, or 4 amino acids, and/or the centric 1 , 2, 3, or 4 amino acids (i.e. in the midst of the CDR sequence), and which modification does not affect, in particular impair, the activity of this sequence. In the case of a binding site having specificity to a selected target antigen, the functionally active variant of an antibody would still have the predetermined binding specificity, or substantially the same biological activity, though this could be changed, e.g. to change the fine specificity to a specific epitope, the affinity, the avidity, the Kon or Koff rate, etc. For example, an affinity matured antibody is specifically understood as a functionally active variant antibody. Hence, the modified CDR sequence in an affinity matured antibody is understood as a functionally active CDR variant. </p> Preferably, an agent is used which binds to pRANKL with a high affinity, in particular with a high on and/or a low off rate, or a high avidity of binding. The binding affinity is usually characterized in terms of the concentration of the agent, at which half of the binding sites are occupied, known as the dissociation constant (Kd, or KD). Usually a binder is considered a high affinity binder with a Kd&lt;10<sup>\"8</sup> M, preferably a Kd&lt;10<sup>\"9</sup> M, even more preferred is a Kd&lt;10<sup>\"10</sup> M. \n\n Yet, in an alternatively preferred embodiment the individual antigen binding affinities are of medium affinity, e.g. with a Kd of less than 10<sup>~6</sup> M and up to 10<sup>~8</sup> M, e.g. when binding to at least two antigens. </p> The term \"substantially the same biological activity\" as used herein refers to the activity as indicated by substantially the same activity being at least 20%, at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 90%, e.g. at least 100%, or at least 125%, or at least 150%, or at least 175%, or e.g. up to 200% of the activity as determined for the comparable or parent antibody. </p> In a preferred embodiment the functionally active variant of a parent antibody a) is a biologically active fragment of the antibody, the fragment comprising at least 50% of the sequence of the molecule, preferably at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, or at least 95% and most preferably at least 97%, 98% or 99%; </p> b) is derived from the antibody by at least one amino acid substitution, addition and/or deletion, wherein the functionally active variant has a sequence identity to the molecule or part of it, such as an antibody of at least 50% sequence identity, preferably at least 60%, more preferably at least 70%, more preferably at least 80%, still more preferably at least 90%, even more preferably at least 95% and most preferably at least 97%, 98% or 99%; and/or </p> c) consists of the antibody or a functionally active variant thereof and additionally at least one amino acid or nucleotide heterologous to the polypeptide or the nucleotide sequence. </p> In one preferred embodiment of ",
    "f the substances in humans are ultimately required for approval as drugs, and these experiments are contemplated herein. Thus the antagonistic agent of the present invention may be tested in animal models or in humans to determine their therapeutic efficacy, toxicity, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, and/or other clinical properties. Denosumab is a commercially available product with well-established biological properties, though the anti-pRANKL effect inhibiting interactions of a cancer cell with thrombocytes turned out to be surprising. </p> The term \"specific\" with regard to the RANKL-specific agent as described herein shall refer to a binding reaction which is determinative of the cognate ligand of interest (RANKL) in a heterogeneous population of molecules. Thus, under designated conditions, e.g. immunoassay conditions, the agent that specifically binds to its particular target does not bind in a significant amount to other molecules present in a sample. \n\n A specific binding site or a specific agent is typically recognizing the target only, and not cross-reactive with other targets. Still, the specific binding site may specifically bind to one or more epitopes, isoforms or variants of the target, or be cross -reactive to other related target antigens, e.g., homologs or analogs. </p> The specific binding means that binding is selective in terms of target identity, high, medium or low binding affinity or avidity, as selected. Selective binding is usually achieved if the binding constant or binding dynamics is at least 10 fold different, preferably the difference is at least 100 fold, and more preferred a least 1000 fold. </p> The term \"surgical intervention\" herein also referred to as \"surgery\" shall refer to a surgical removal, e.g. biopsy, resection or ectomy of tissue comprising all or a part of a tumor, in particular a primary tumor such as a solid tumor and/or one or more metastases. </p> According to a specific example, the effect of RANKL expression by resting or activated thrombocytes was tested in a lung metastasis mouse model. In the human system it could be shown that activated thrombocytes expressed RANKL at a higher level as compared to non-activated thrombocytes. </p> According to another example, a RANK-Fc fusion protein was used (Schmiedel et al. 2013, Cancer Res. 73(2):683-94), which is composed of a human RANK receptor and Fc of human lgG1 , and which comprises point mutations to reduce its affinity to the Fc receptor FcgammaRllla, CD16, which are 233P/L234V/L235A/AG236/A327G/A330S (nomenclature according to Kabat, EU index). The effect of the RANK-Fc fusion protein on metastasis formation in a lung metastasis mouse model was determined. It was shown that neutralization of RANKL by the RANK-Fc fusion protein was about as effective as thrombocyte depletion. </p> Further examples can show that pRANKL is transferred by platelets to RANKL negative tumor cells, thereby transforming the tumor cells to RANKL positive ones.
