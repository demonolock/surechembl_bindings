    "f inosine 5\u2032-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), enhances the efficacy of IFN-alpha in the treatment of HCV. Despite the introduction of ribavirin, more than 50% of the patients do not eliminate the virus with the current standard therapy of interferon-alpha (IFN) and ribavirin. By now, standard therapy of chronic hepatitis C has been changed to the combination of pegylated IFN-alpha plus ribavirin. However, a number of patients still have significant side effects, primarily related to ribavirin. Ribavirin causes significant hemolysis in 10-20% of patients treated at currently recommended doses, and the drug is both teratogenic and embryotoxic. Even with recent improvements, a substantial fraction of patients do not respond with a sustained reduction in viral load 5 and there is a clear need for more effective antiviral therapy of HCV infection. </p> A number of approaches are being pursuit to combat the virus. They include, for example, application of antisense oligonucleotides or ribozymes for inhibiting HCV replication. Furthermore, low-molecular weight compounds that directly inhibit HCV proteins and interfere with viral replication are considered as attractive strategies to control HCV infection. Among the viral targets, the NS3/4A protease/helicase and the NS5b RNA-dependent RNA polymerase are considered the most promising viral targets for new drugs.<sup>6,8 </sup></p> The NS5b RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in particular has been shown to be amenable to small-molecule inhibition. Besides several nucleoside inhibitors,<sup>9,10 </sup>at least three allosteric sites have been described,<sup>7 </sup>along with multiple inhibitor scaffolds.<sup>11,14 </sup></p> Besides targeting viral genes and their transcription and translation products, antiviral activity can also be achieved by targeting host cell proteins that are necessary for viral replication. For example, Watashi et al.<sup>15 </sup>show how antiviral activity can be achieved by inhibiting host cell cyclophilins. Alternatively, a potent TLR7 agonist has been shown to reduce HCV plasma levels in humans.<sup>16 </sup></p> However, none of the compounds described above have progressed beyond clinical trials.<sup>6,8 </sup></p> In view of the worldwide epidemic level of HCV and other members of the Flaviviridae family of viruses, and further in view of the limited treatment options, there is a strong need for new effective drugs for treating infections cause by these viruses. </p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  This invention is directed to novel compounds that are useful in the viral infections in mammals, mediated at least in part by a virus in the Flaviviridae family of viruses. In one of its composition aspects, the present invention is directed to compounds of Formula I:  \n<img id=\"EMI-C00001\" path=\"US20060194749A1-20060831-C00001.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/33999673/US/20060831/A1/020060/19/47/49/US20060194749A1-20060831-C00001.TIF\"/>\n\n wherein \n</p><img id=\"cu"
