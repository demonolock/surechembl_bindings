    " treatment.</p>\u00a0This therapeutic composition may comprise a mixture, in variable proportions, of free FAD and of FAD at least partially encapsulated in the form of a particle. The composition comprises free FAD and particles as described above comprising a vector and FAD at least partially encapsulated by the vector. The FAD is said to be free because it is not linked to a particle.</p>\u00a0This association of two forms of FAD to provide a first quantity of FAD very quickly thanks to the free form then the encapsulated FAD releases over time the FAD ensuring administration for a prolonged duration.</p>\u00a0The composition is advantageously formulated to be suitable for parenteral administration including intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous and / or vaginal or rectal administration depending on the location of the cancerous lesions to be reached.</p>The composition is advantageously formulated to be suitable for intravesical administration.  The composition is advantageously formulated to be suitable in the form of a solution for injection, an oral solution and / or a gel.</p>\u00a0According to one aspect, the invention relates to a nanoformulation of FAD. Advantageously, the nanoformulation comprises FAD at least preferably encapsulated in or with a particle comprising a vector and FAD. Preferably, the nanoparticle has a diameter of less than 50 nm.</p>\u00a0As a preferred example, the effective plasma concentration of FAD is between 1 and 10 mM / L. Indeed, the inhibitory concentration (IC50) which reduces the growth of cancer cells in cultures by 50%, could be observed in a range of 0.5 to 5 mM / L</p>\u00a0Typically, the FAD, a particle of FAD (micro or nanoparticle of FAD, FAD MNP) according to the invention or a pharmaceutical composition comprising FAD, or FAD MNP according to the invention, as described below are administered to the subject in a therapeutically effective amount.</p>\u00a0By \"therapeutically effective amount\" of FAD, particle of FAD (micro or nanoparticle of FAD), FAD MNP according to the invention as described above, is meant a sufficient amount of FAD, of Micro or Nano Particles of FAD, FAD MNP to mitigate, prevent, neutralize, treat or even eliminate cancer with a reasonable benefit / risk ratio applicable to any medical treatment.</p>\u00a0The risk brought to the patient in the case of the invention is lower and represents an advantage compared to the treatment proposed previously since no side effect is observed.</p>\u00a0The risk brought to the patient in the case of the invention is lower and represents an advantage compared to the treatment proposed previously since no side effect with FAD is observed.</p>Thus, the invention relates to another aspect: a combination of FAD and another anti-cancer drug, this other anti-cancer drug may be used at a lower dose than the dose usually used and induce an equivalent anti-cancer effect. and / or greater than the sum of the anti-cancer effects added by the FAD and the said anti-cancer drug at the dose used, a"
