    "factors are known to mediate protein-protein interactions. A rank order was developed based on percent PP<sub>II </sub>content, structural similarity with wild type GILZ and percent contact with p65-TAD. We selected two GILZ mimics or analogs (GA-1 and GA-2) that exhibit near native docking, structural congruence with experimental PP<sub>II </sub>and wild type GILZ and good PP<sub>II </sub>potential for screening by cellular analyses. In addition we selected one mimic with good PP<sub>II </sub>potential but fewer contacts with p65-TAD and two GILZ mimics that possess low PP<sub>II </sub>content but acceptable percent contact with the p65-TAD in docking analyses as control peptides for PP<sub>II </sub>conformation (control peptide 1) and p65 docking potential (control peptide 2 and control peptide 3) respectively.</p>Example 3Binding of GILZ and human r-p65: Previously we observed that the r-GILZ exhibits ten times higher affinity than a 22 residue GILZ peptide for r-p65. We used similar method to determine direct binding kinetics of GA hexapeptides with human r-p65. High binding ELISA plates were coated with increasing concentrations of r-GILZ (0.5 \u03bcM to 20 \u03bcM) or each GA or control peptide (20 \u03bcM-640 \u03bcM) and probed with 80 pM r-p65 followed by detection with anti-DDK antibody. Absorbance at 650 nm was measured with a mixing time of 30 s using BIORAD microplate reader. Percent bound p65 was determined considering the binding response of r-GILZ (20 pM) with r-p65 as 100%. The dissociation constant of the interaction between the GA or the control peptide and r-p65 was determined by the method of Friguet et al., as described. A fraction of the bound r-p65 (x) and the ratio of bound r-p65 to the free GA or control peptide (y) was determined by the equations: x=(A<sub>0</sub>\u2212A)/(A<sub>0</sub>), where A<sub>0 </sub>is the absorbance of r-p65anti-p65 complex in the absence of bound GA or control peptide and y=(A<sub>0</sub>\u2212A)/(a<sub>0</sub>\u2212i<sub>0</sub>)\u00d7(A<sub>0</sub>\u2212A)/(A<sub>0</sub>), where a<sub>0 </sub>is the total concentration of GA or control peptide and i<sub>0 </sub>is the total concentration of r-p65. K<sub>D </sub>for the interaction was determined by the Scatchard equation: x=1+K<sub>D</sub>/y.</p>Kinetics of GA: p65 interaction: Previously the strength of interaction between rGILZ or wild type GILZ-P and r-p65 has been shown to be 5.91\u00b12.4*10<sup>\u22127</sup>M and 1.12\u00b10.25*10<sup>\u22126</sup>M, respectively. We evaluated the binding kinetics of individual GA at increasing concentrations with the plate bound r-p65 protein at constant concentration. We observed that the percent bound r-p65 was over 25% with GA-1, GA-2 and CP-1 even at the lowest concentration evaluated (FIG. 3A). The dissociate constant, K<sub>D</sub>, as calculated by the method of Friguet et al. was 2.29+/\u22120.2\u00d710<sup>\u22126</sup>M for GA-1 and 3.24+/\u22120.19\u00d710<sup>\u22126</sup>M for GA-2. The strength of interaction of the GA:p65-TAD binding is consistent with other transient protein:pe"
