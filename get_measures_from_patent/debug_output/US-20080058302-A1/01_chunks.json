    ", 10 mg/mL leupeptin, 10 mg/mL pepstatin A, 200 mg/mL bacitracin, and 0.5 mg/mL aprotinin), homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann) at a setting of 1 for 20 sec and centrifuged at 38,000\u00d7g for 20 min at 4\u00b0 C. The pellet was resuspended in Tris assay buffer and aliquots of 1 mg protein/mL were stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. for further use. </p> Preparation of Rat Cerebellar Membranes for Cannabinoid Receptor-Mediated Stimulation of [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP\u03b3S Binding </p> Rat cerebella were excised and placed into homogenization buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4, containing 3 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>and 1 mM EGTA) and homogenized for 20 sec using a Polytron homogenizer at a setting of 1 and centrifuged at 4\u00b0 C. for 10 min at 48,000\u00d7g. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer and centrifuged at 4\u00b0 C. for 10 min at 48,000\u00d7g. The supernatant was removed and the pellets were resuspended in 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4, containing 3 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>and 0.2 mM EGTA and stored as aliquots of 1 mg protein/mL at \u221280\u00b0 C. for further use. </p> Inhibition of CB Receptor Binding by Test Compounds </p> Binding assays were performed by incubating 0.2-0.6 nM (34,000-100,000 dpm) [<sup>3</sup>H]CP55940 with membranes prepared from cells expressing cloned human CB1 or CB2 receptors in buffer A (50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.0, 5.0 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.0 mM EGTA and 1.0 mg/mL fatty acid free bovine serum albumin). After incubation for 60 min at room temperature for the hCB2 binding assay or 120 min at 30\u00b0 C. for the hCB1 assay, the assays were filtered through GF/C filters that had been pre-soaked overnight in 0.5% (w/v) PEI and 0.1% BSA in water. The filters were rinsed 6 times with one mL of cold wash buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.0, 5.0 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.0 mM EGTA and 0.75 mg/mL fatty acid free bovine serum albumin), 30 \u03bcL of MicroScint 20 was added to each filter and the radioactivity on the filters determined by scintillation spectroscopy. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 \u03bcM WIN55212-2. </p> Cannabinoid receptor-mediated stimulation of [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP\u03b3S binding </p> hCB1-Mediated stimulation of [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP\u03b3S binding was measured in a mixture containing 100-150 pM [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP\u03b3S, 150 mM NaCl, 45 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 3 mM GDP, 0.4 mM DTT, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mg/mL fatty acid free BSA, 25 \u03bcg of membrane protein and agonist in a total volume of 250 \u03bcL of buffer A in 96 well Basic Flashplates (Perkin Elmer). After incubation at room temperature for 2 hours the plates were centrifuged at 800\u00d7g at 4\u00b0 C. for 5 min and the radioactivity bound to the membranes was determined by scintillation spectrometry using the Topcount (Perkin Elmer). </p> hCB2-Mediated [35 S]GTP\u03b3S binding was measured in the same way except the assay mixture contained 10 mM GDP and the incubation time was 6 hours. [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP\u03b3S binding in rat cerebellar homogenate was determined in a mixture containing 40-60 pM [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP\u03b3"
