    "atuberculosis were fractionated by gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were incubated with sera from uninfected (lane 8) or infected animals (lanes 4 to 7), either pre-absorbed (lane 7) or not (lanes 4, 5, 6) with a mixture of homogenates of M. avium, M. bovis and M. phlei. Membrane-bound primary Ig were revealed by labeled secondary Ig. Sera of infected animals were as follows: asymptomatic-non excretory (lane 4), asymptomatic-excretory (lane 5), and symptomatic-excretory (lane 6, 7) cases of paratuberculosis. Reference molecular weight standards (lane 1) and A36 proteins (lane 2) were stained by India ink. Reference: A36 proteins immunoblotted with anti-A36 rabbit antiserum (lane 3). </p> Figure 5 represents the analysis of the size of the polypeptide (p362) fused to \u03b2-galactosidase expressed by recombinant clone a362 (hereafter defined). This fusion protein is named \u03b2gal-p362. </p> Lysate proteins of E. coli Y1089 lysogenized either by standard \u03bbgt11 (tracks C and E) or by the same phage carrying the insert coding for p362 (clone \n\n a362) (tracks D and F) were fractionated by 7.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Tracks C and D and molecular weight standards (tracks A and B) were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue, whereas tracks E and F were treated with rabbit anti-A36 antiserum and stained with peroxydase-labeled anti-rabbit antiserum. </p> Figure 6 represents the evidence of the belonging of the recombinant polypeptide p362 to the 34 kD protein of the A36 complex. </p> The TMA complex from M. paratuberculosis was dissociated and its protein components were fractionated by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transblotted to a nitrocellulose membrane. Fractionated proteins were either stained with India ink (track b) or incubated with rabbit anti-\u03b2gal-p362 antiserum (track c). Track a: molecular weight standards. </p> Figure 7A represents the nucleic acid sequence encompassing the nucleic acid sequence of Figure 7B and the one of Figure 7C. </p> Figure 7B represents a sequence homologous to the one represented on Figure 7C. </p> Figure 7C represents the base sequence of the M. paratuberculosis genomic fragment present in clone a362 and coding for p362. </p> It should be noted that the two EcoRI sites [GAATTC] present at both ends of the sequence are a result of the cloning strategy and are not naturally present in the genomic sequence. </p> Figure 8 represents the amino acid sequence and corresponding nucleotide sequence of the recombinant polypeptide p362. </p> It should be noted that the first two amino acids, corresponding to the EcoRI sites in the DNA sequence, are not naturally present in the native protein, but are a result of cloning. \n\n Figure 9a corresponds to the restriction and genetic map of the pmTNF-MPH plasmid used in Example II for the expression of p362 of the invention in E. coli. </p> Figure 9b corresponds to the pmTNF-MPH nucleic acid sequence. </p> On this figure, the origin of n"
