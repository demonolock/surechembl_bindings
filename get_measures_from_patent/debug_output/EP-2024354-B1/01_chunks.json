    "+</sup> sensitive dye Fluo-3 (TEFLABS 0116) at 4\u00b5M in a loading media consisting of Nut Mix F12 (HAM) with Glutamax I, 22mM HEPES, 2.5mM Probenicid (Sigma P-8761) and 0.04% Pluronic F-127 (Sigma P-2443) for 1 h kept dark in a 37\u00b0C CO<sub>2</sub>-incubator. The cells were then washed three times in assay buffer (Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 20mM HEPES, 2.5mM Probenicid and 0.1% BSA) using a multi-channel pipette leaving them in 150\u00b5l at the end of the last wash. Serial dilutions of a test compound in assay buffer (final DMSO concentration kept below 1 %) were automatically pipetted by FLIPR (Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader) into each test well and the fluorescence intensity was recorded (excitation 488 nm and emission 530 nm) by the FLIPR CCD camera for a 2 min pre-incubation period. 50\u00b5l of the Substance P (NK<sub>1</sub> specific), NKA (NK<sub>2</sub> specific), or Pro-7-NKB (NK<sub>3</sub> specific) agonist solution (final concentration equivalent to an approximate EC<sub>60</sub> concentration) was then added by FLIPR into each well already containing 200\u00b5l assay buffer (containing the test compound or vehicle) and the fluorescence was continuously monitored for another 2 min. The response was measured as the peak relative fluorescence after agonist addition and IC<sub>50</sub>s were calculated from ten-point concentration-response curves for each compound. The IC<sub>50</sub>s were then converted to pK<sub>B</sub> values with the following formula: KB=IC50/1+EC60conc.of agonist used in assay/EC50agonist<img id=\"ib0021\" path=\"imgb0021.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/146029822/EP/20110921/B1/000002/02/43/54/imgb0021.tif\"/> pKB=-logKB<img id=\"ib0022\" path=\"imgb0022.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/146029823/EP/20110921/B1/000002/02/43/54/imgb0022.tif\"/></p>Determining the Dissociation Constant (Ki) of compounds for Human NK<sub>1</sub>/NK<sub>2</sub>/NK<sub>3</sub> Receptors (Binding Assay)Membranes were prepared from CHO cells stably transfected with human NK<sub>1</sub>, NK<sub>2</sub> or NK<sub>3</sub> receptors according to the following method.</p>Cells were detached with Accutase\u00ae solution, harvested in PBS containing 5% FBS by centrifugation, washed twice in PBS and resuspended to a concentration of 1x10<sup>8</sup> cells/ml in Tris-HCl 50 mM, KCl 300 mM, EDTA-N<sub>2</sub>10 mM pH 7.4 (4\u00b0C). Cell suspensions were homogenized with an UltraTurrax 30 s 12.000 rpm. The homogenates were centrifuged at 38.000 x g (4\u00b0C) and the pellet resuspended in Tris-HCl 50 mM pH 7.4. The homogenization was repeated once and the homogenates were incubated on ice for 45 min. The homogenates were again centrifuged as described above and resuspended in Tris-HCl 50mM pH 7.4. This centrifugation step was repeated 3 times in total. After the last centrifugation step the pellet was resuspended in Tris-HCl 50mM and homogenized with Dual Potter, 10 strokes to a homogenous solution, an aliquot was removed for protein determination. Membranes were aliquoted and frozen at -80\u00b0C until use.</p>The radioligand binding assay is performed at room temperature in 96-well microtiter plates (No-binding Surface Plates, Corning 3600) with a final assay volume of 200\u00b5l/well in incubation buffer (50mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4 RT) containing 0.1 % BSA, 40 mg/L Bacitracin, complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tablets 20 pills/L (Roche) and 3mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>). Competition binding curves were done by adding increasing amounts of the test compound. Test compounds were dissolved and serially diluted in DMSO, final DMSO concentration 1.5 % in the assay. 50\u00b5l Non labelled ZD 6021 (a non selective NK-antagonist, 10 \u00b5M final conc) was added for measurement of non-specific binding. For total binding, 50 \u00b5l of 1.5% DMSO (final conc) in incubation buffer was used.
