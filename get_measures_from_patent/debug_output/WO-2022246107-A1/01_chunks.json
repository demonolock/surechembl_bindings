Cultured 4T1 cells at a density of 7,000 cells per well were treated by free uptake with various concentrations of modified oligonucleotide as specified in the tables below. After a treatment period of approximately 48 hours, total RNA was isolated from the cells, and COASY RNA levels were measured by quantitative real-time RTPCR. Mouse COASY primer-probe set RTS52828 (described herein above) was used to measure RNA levels as described \n\nabove. COASY RNA levels were normalized to total RNA content, as measured by RIBOGREEN\u00ae. Reduction of COASY RNA is presented in the tables below as percent COASY RNA, relative to untreated control cells (% UTC). </p>The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of each modified oligonucleotide was calculated using a linear regression on a log/linear plot of the data in Excel and is also presented in the tables below. </p>Table 4.

One group of four male C57BL/6 mice was injected with PBS. The PBS-injected group served as the control group to which modified oligonucleotide-treated groups were compared.

Mouse primer probe set RTS52828 (described herein above) was used to measure mouse COASY RNA levels. COASY RNA levels were normalized to total RNA content, as measured by RIBOGREEN\u00ae. Results are presented as percent mouse COASY RNA, relative to the amount of mouse COASY RNA in PBS treated animals (%control). ED50s were calculated in Prism using nonlinear fit with variable slope (three parameter), top constrained to 100% (or 1), bottom constrained to 0.
