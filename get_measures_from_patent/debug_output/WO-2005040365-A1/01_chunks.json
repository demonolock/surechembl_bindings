    "mation for efficient replication, while vpu holds information regulating the release of new viral particles from the infected host cell. Ultimately, in order for HIV to infect a target cell, it must inject the HIV genetic material into the target cells cytoplasm. \n\n034698.0016 PATENT APPLICATION</p>\n  [0010] As noted above, the nef gene is believed to aid efficient replication of HIV. The creation of a new virus particle occurs at the host cell's membrane. Nef appears to affect an infected cell's environment in a way that optimizes replication. Viral proteins collect near the host cell's membrane, bud out within the membrane, and break away. These proteins are the three structural proteins (gp160, gp120, gp41 ) plus two other internal precursor polyproteins (Gag and the Gag - Pol). The Gag-Pol protein brings two strands of the positive RNA into the bud, while protease cuts itself free. After the virus has budded, protease cuts itself free and cuts up the rest of the proteins in Gag or Gag-Pol, releasing the various structural proteins and reverse transcriptase. The viral proteins are not functional until they are separated by the protease. Thus, protease is responsible for cleavage of Gag-Pol and the smaller Gag polyprotein into structural proteins. Released proteins p24, p7 and p6 form a new capsid, while at the base of the lipid membrane is p17. In this process, gp160 breaks down into gp120 and gp41 by a host enzyme.</p>\n  [0011] The gag gene gives rise to a 55-kilodalton (kD) Gag precursor protein, also called p55 (Pr55<sup>9ag</sup>), which is expressed from the unspliced viral messenger RNA (mRNA). During translation, the N terminus of the p55 is myristylated, triggering its association with the cytoplasmic aspect of cell membranes. The membrane-associated Gag polyprotein recruits two copies of the viral genomic RNA along with other viral and cellular proteins that trigger the budding of the viral particles from the surface of an infected cell. After budding, p55 is cleaved by the virally encoded protease (a product of the Pol gene), during the process of viral maturation into four smaller proteins designated MA (matrix or p17), CA (capsid or p24) and NC (nucleocapsid or p9 and p6.) (Cohen, P.T., et al., The AIDS Knowledge Base, 149 (1999)) Thus, the HIV core contains four proteins, including p17. In summation, the HIV virus is encoded by three large genes encoding structural and enzymatic peptides (gag, pol and env) and six smaller regulatory genes (vif, vpu, vpr, tat, rev and nef). (Sande, Merle A., et al., The Medical Management of AIDS, Ch. 2 (6th ed. 1999)) \n\n034698.0016 PATENT APPLICATION</p>\n  [0012] Pr55<sup>gag</sup> (the polypeptide encoded by the gag gene) is cleaved by viral protease to generate four large and two small peptides. From N to C terminus the following proteins are proteolytically produced: matrix (p17MA), capsid (p24CA), nucleocapsid (p7NC), and p6. The two small peptides include p2 located between p24CA and P7NC and",

(U.S. EPA, 1986) It is contemplated that the present invention would include Nickel preferable in the form of nickel chloride on the order of average daily intake well below the reference dose. Therefore, the present invention may be produced using nickel to enhance immune response.</p>\n  E. Summary</p>\n  [0172] To prepare the composition that constitutes the vaccine agent for the invention, it is possible to use known methods of purification, synthesis, or genetic engineering. Practitioners skilled in the art may isolate and purify a fragment, or prepare a sequence encoding the amino terminal end of the matrix protein (p17MA) and the covalent binding site for myristate on the HIV virus. Protein fragments, naked DNA/RNA, recombinant \n\n034698.0016 PATENT APPLICATION</p>\n  DNA/RNA, or messenger RNA may be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions appropriate for the anticipated method of administration, such as carriers or excipients. An animal or subject for which an immune response according to the present invention is desired may be administered the composition; a therapeutically effective dose would be that amount necessary to reverse specific immune suppression, to the extent desired, and determined using standard means, such as Chromium Release Assay, Intracellular Cytokine Assay, Lympho-proliferative Assay (LPA), Interferon Gamma (IFN-gamma) ELISpot Assays, and MHC Tetramer Binding Assays. The MHC Tetramer Binding Assay is preferable. These same laboratory tests would be applied to measure the immune response of an uninfected subject.</p>\n  [0173] The analysis and development of the immunogenic composition should incorporate a wide range of doses of inactivated particulate for evaluation. Animal trials should consider differences in size, species, and immunological characteristics; it is anticipated that immunological differences between humans and animals may relegate animal trials to toxicity analysis. Clinical trials will involve at least the standard three phase model, ranging from safety and dosage in a small population, safety and immunogenicity in a second phase of several hundred volunteers, to a large scale effectiveness phase. The clinical trials should include appropriate exclusionary criteria as is customary, such as exclusion for other immune suppression conditions, pregnancy, active drug use, etc. A starting dose for trials with subunit proteins may be 10 micrograms/strain for juveniles and 20 micrograms/strain for adults. For naked DNA vaccines a starting dose of 1 microgram/strain for all ages would be appropriate.</p>\n  [0174] Administration may be made in a variety of routes, for example orally, transbucally, transmucosally, sublingually, nasally, rectally, vaginally, intraocularly, intramuscularly, intralymphatically, intravenously, subcutaneously, transdermally, intradermally, intra tumor, topically, transpulmonarily, by inhalation, by injection, or by impla"
