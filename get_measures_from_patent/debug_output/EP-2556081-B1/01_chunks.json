The mixture was boiled for about 4 hours, and the progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC. After neutralizing the mixture with 1M methanolic NaOH, the solvent was evaporated. Dry residue was distributed between water (10 mL) and methanol (3 x 10 mL), and next, activated charcoal (300 mg) was added to the organic layer. After filtration, the filtrate was evaporated to dryness to obtain a white-yellow precipitate with 74% yield. Reaction progress was monitored on TLC plates covered with silica gel in eluent B: Rf (AcOEt: MeOH 6:4) 0,4 or C: Rf (acetone : water 15:1) 0,7.\n<img id=\"ib0020\" path=\"imgb0020.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/841433983/EP/20210616/B1/000002/55/60/81/imgb0020.tif\"/></p>ES-MS: ES<sup>+</sup> m/z 206 [M + H]<sup>+</sup>, 238 [M + H + MeOH]<sup>+</sup>, 244 [M + K]<sup>+</sup>\n<sup>1</sup>H-NMR (300 MHz, D<sub>2</sub>O) \u03b4 1.3 (s, 3H, CH<sub>3</sub>); 4.6 (s, 2H, H-8); 6.2 (m, 1H, H-9); 6.3 (m, 1H, H-10); 7.3 (m, 1H, H-11); 7.4 (s, 1H, H-6).</p>The activity of compounds listed in Table 1 were characterized by the inhibition constant, Ki. Ki values were determined in vitro in DNA (pUC18 plasmid) methylation by means of prokaryotic methyltransferase SssI, with [<sup>1</sup>H]-S-adenosyl-L-methionin (SAM) as methyl group donor. The reaction mixture contained: 0.1 \u00b5g (0.5 \u00b5g, 1 \u00b5g DNA), 1U of the enzyme and 2 \u00b5M of [<sup>1</sup>H]-SAM, 50 mM of NaCl, 10 mM of DTT, 10 mM of Tris-HCl at pH 7.9. The level of methylation was determined from the measurement of radioactivity incorporated into DNA at three different concentrations of the inhibitor (Table 1). Ki values were determined by the Dixon method from the relationship between [1/Vo] and the concentration of the inhibitor [I]. For acompetitive inhibitors, the Ki' values being the inhibition constant of the enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex, was determined by the Cornish-Bowden method from the relationship between [Vo/S], where S is the concentration of the substrate, and the concentration f the inhibitor [I].</p>In vitro analysis of compounds listed in Table 1 showed that these compounds were competitive inhibitors of methyltransferase SssI, directly binding to the active sites of the enzyme. This constitutes the advantage of these compounds over azanucleosides currently used in the treatment (Vidaza, Dacogen), with their therapeutic activity depending on incorporation into DNA strands, or RNA strands in case of ribonucleosides, which is the cause of their high toxicity. Compounds listed in Table 1 are not toxic to HeLa cell lines.\nTable 1 Structure and properties of cytosine analogues.
