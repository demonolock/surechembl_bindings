    "1(+) for mammalian expression and were stably transfected into chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. SGLT2-expressing clones were selected based on resistance to G418 antibiotic (Geneticin) and activity in the <sup>14</sup>C-\u03b1-methyl-D-glucopyranoside (<sup>14</sup>C-AMG) uptake assay.</p>Test 2: Inhibitory Effects on Human SGLT2 ActivitiesFor sodium-dependent glucose transport assay, cells expressing hSGLT2 were seeded into a 96-well culture plate at a density of 5\u00d710<sup>4 </sup>cells/well in RPMI medium 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were used 1 day after plating. They were incubated in pretreatment buffer (10 mM HEPES, 5 mM Tris, 140 mM choline chloride, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4) at 37\u00b0 C. for 10 min. They were then incubated in uptake buffer (10 mM HEPES, 5 mM Tris, 140 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 mM <sup>14</sup>C-nonlabeled AMG pH 7.4) containing <sup>14</sup>C-labeled AMG (8 \u03bcM) and the inventive compound or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) vehicle at 37\u00b0 C. for 2 h. Cells were washed twice with washing buffer (pretreatment buffer containing 10 mM AMG at room temperature) and then the radioactivity was measured using a liquid scintillation counter. IC<sub>50 </sub>was determined by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad PRISM [Katsuno, K. et al. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007, 320, 323-330; Han, S. et al. Diabetes, 2008, 57, 1723-1729].
