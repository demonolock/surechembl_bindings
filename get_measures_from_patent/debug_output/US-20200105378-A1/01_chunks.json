    " \u03b1-chains can be included in a class II construct. By multiplexing HLA alleles in a single construct, multiple HLA molecules can be delivered and expressed in a cell line of interest. Allele multiplexing enables the matching to patient HLA types and personalized peptide antigen readouts with the application of the Universal IP pipeline and subsequent complex and/or peptide analysis, e.g., LC-MS/MS readout.</p>FIG. 17 is schematics of multi-allelic and mono-allelic approaches in HLA ligand profiling. In a multi-allelic approach, the HLA ligands are co-immunoprecipitated with HLA heterodimers directly from patient material or cell lines (top). Because these cells naturally expressed multiple HLA alleles, peptides identified from such multi-allelic approaches must be deconvoluted to assign binding to a specific HLA heterodimer if the HLA types are known. In a mono-allelic approach, the HLA-ligands are co-immunoprecipitated with HLA heterodimers from cell lines genetically modified for expression of only a single HLA allele (bottom). Thus, peptides identified from mono-allelic approaches do not require deconvolution for HLA heterodimer binding assignments.</p>FIG. 18A is a diagram showing mutated neoantigenic peptide presented on MHC.</p>FIG. 18B is a schematic method of developing personalized neoantigen-targeting therapy as described herein.</p>FIG. 19 shows a schematic showing different experimental approaches of different HLA-ligand profiling. Biochemical peptide:MHC (p:MHC) binding assay is slow and low-throughput and has no insights on processing. Multi-allelic mass spectrometry is high-throughput and has ability to learn processing rules; however, it requires in silico imputation to assign peptides to alleles. Mono-allelic mass spectrometry provides a rapid, unbiased, and clean approach for defining peptide-binding motifs across diverse MHC alleles. Mono-allelic mass spectrometry can rapidly and systematically fill allege coverage gaps and makes it possible to leverage allele-specific peptide length preferences.</p>FIG. 20A shows a table of exemplary HLA binding peptides (SEQ ID NOS 9-37, respectively, in order of appearance) for A*01:01, B*51:01, A*29:02, and B*54:01 alleles uncovered using mono-allelic approach. Mono-allelic approach uncovers HLA-binding peptides that are poorly scored by NetMHCpan but biochemically validate as strong binders.</p>FIG. 20B is a bar graph showing rates of incorrect assignment in 100 simulated deconvolutions. A random six allele patient HLA genotype (2 alleles each of HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C, sampling at US allele frequencies) was generated. For each allele, 500 peptides from relevant mono-allelic experiment were sampled and combined to create mock 3000 peptide multi-allelic data set. Each peptide was assigned to allele that yields the best NetMHCpan % rank score to determine percentage of peptides incorrectly assigned by NetMHCpan. This process was repeated 100 times.</p>FIG. 21 is a schematic illustration of ",
    "minus of a single allele HLA peptide. In some embodiments, BAP is placed in between a heavy chain domain and \u03b22 microglobulin domain of a class I HLA peptide. In some embodiments, BAP is placed in between \u03b2-chain domain and \u03b1-chain domain of a class II HLA peptide. In some embodiments, BAP is placed in loop regions between \u03b11, \u03b12, and \u03b13 domains of the heavy chain of class I HLA, or between \u03b11 and \u03b12 and \u03b21 and \u03b22 domains of the \u03b1-chain and \u03b2-chain, respectively of class II HLA. Exemplary constructs designed for HLA class I and II expression implementing BAP for biotinylation and immunopurification are described in FIG. 2.</p>As used herein, the term \u201cbiotin\u201d refers to the compound biotin itself and analogues, derivatives and variants thereof. Thus, the term \u201cbiotin\u201d includes biotin (cis-hexahydro-2-oxo-1H-thieno [3,4]imidazole-4-pentanoic acid) and any derivatives and analogs thereof, including biotin-like compounds. Such compounds include, for example, biotin-e-N-lysine, biocytin hydrazide, amino or sulfhydryl derivatives of 2-iminobiotin and biotinyl-E-aminocaproic acid-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, sulfosuccinimideiminobiotin, biotinbromoacetylhydrazide, p-diazobenzoyl biocytin, 3-(N-maleimidopropionyl)biocytin, desthiobiotin, and the like. The term \u201cbiotin\u201d also comprises biotin variants that can specifically bind to one or more of a Rhizavidin, avidin, streptavidin, tamavidin moiety, or other avidin-like peptides.</p>HLA Ligand Profiling ApproachesBiochemical peptide-MHC binding assay for HLA-epitope discovery was the basis for NetMHC, the allele-specific predictor using artificial neural networks; however, biochemical p:MHC binding assay slow is a low-throughput method (FIG. 19). Endogenously processed and presented HLA-ligands profiled from cell lines and patient-derived materials are commonly multi-allelic, meaning that LC-MS/MS data generated from these samples contain a mixed population of ligands that can bind to one of the multiple simultaneously expressed HLA alleles, as shown in FIG. 17 and FIG. 19. Multi-allelic datasets require deconvolution to ascertain which peptides bind to the different HLA heterodimers presented by an individual. Thus, ligands from multi-allelic datasets have to be assigned to their corresponding HLA heterodimers using either (1) binding predictors trained with preexisting data or (2) deconvolution algorithms that leverage overlap across HLA alleles represented in large ligand datasets. It is important to note that only LC-MS/MS datasets with available HLA typing information can be confidently deconvoluted. In fact, nearly 40% of the naturally processed ligands bound to HLA class I complexes reported from multi-allelic studies in the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) lack HLA allele-specific assignments either due to the lack of HLA typing information or inability to deconvolute, making it challenging to use this subset of data for allele-specific epitope prediction. In addition, it is difficult to identify peptides bound to rare class I HLA heterodimers and many class II HLA heterodimers because there is not enough annotated data for deconvolution. The multi-allelic",
    "ts, the antigenic peptide molecules are equal to about 20 to about 30 amino acids. A longer peptide can be designed in several ways. For example, when the HLA-binding regions are predicted or known, a longer peptide can consist of either: individual binding peptides with an extension of 0-10 amino acids toward the N- and C-terminus of each corresponding gene product. A longer peptide can also consist of a concatenation of some or all of the binding peptides with extended sequences for each. In another case, when sequencing reveals a long (&gt;10 residues) epitope sequence present in the diseased tissue (e.g. due to a frameshift, read-through or intron inclusion that leads to a novel peptide sequence), a longer peptide can consist of the entire stretch of novel disease-specific amino acids. In both cases, use of a longer peptide requires endogenous processing by professional antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells and can lead to more effective antigen presentation and induction of T cell responses. In some embodiments, the extended sequence is altered to improve the biochemical properties of the polypeptide (properties such as solubility or stability) or to improve the likelihood for efficient proteasomal processing of the peptide.</p>The antigenic peptides and polypeptides can bind an HLA protein. In some embodiments, the antigenic peptides can bind an HLA protein with greater affinity than a corresponding native/wild-type peptide. The antigenic peptide can have an IC50 of about less than 1000 nM, about less than 500 nM, about less than 250 nM, about less than 200 nM, about less than 150 nM, about less than 100 nM, or about less than 50 nM. In some embodiments, the antigenic peptides do not induce an autoimmune response and/or invoke immunological tolerance when administered to a subject.</p>The present disclosure also provides compositions comprising a plurality of antigenic peptides. Reference to antigenic peptides includes any suitable delivery modality that can result in introduction of the peptide into a subject's cell (e.g., nucleic acid). In some embodiments, the composition comprises at least 3 or more antigenic peptides. In some embodiments the composition contains at least about 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 distinct peptides. In some embodiments the composition contains at least 20 distinct peptides. In some embodiments the composition contains at most 20 distinct peptides. According to the present disclosure, 2 or more of the distinct peptides can be derived from the same polypeptide. For example, if an antigenic mutation encodes a polypeptide, two or more of the antigenic peptides can be derived from the polypeptide. In one embodiment, the two or more antigenic peptides derived from the polypeptide can comprise a tiled array that spans the polypeptide (e.g., the antigenic peptides can comprise a series of overlapping antigenic pepti"
