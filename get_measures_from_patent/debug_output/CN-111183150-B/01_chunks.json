The binding capacity of fcyriia mutants was measured using Blitz (Fortebio). For stable analysis, rituximab antibodies were immobilized on an amine-reactive second generation (AR 2G) biosensor (Fortebio) diluted with 40 \u03bcg/mL sodium acetate (pH 5.0) solution and assayed for binding capacity by reaction with fcyriia mutants (wild-type SH2a40, MG2a28, MG2a 45) serially diluted with 1x kinetic buffer (Fortebio) (fig. 11).

As a result, it was confirmed that SH2a40, MG2a28, and MG2a45 screened in the present disclosure had 3.57-fold, 6.16-fold, and 8.26-fold increases in binding ability to Fc, respectively.</p>Example 12: establishment of FcgammaRIIa error-prone PCR library based on affinity matured MG2A28 and MG2A45</p>To construct the library of MG2a28 and MG2a 45-based fcyriia mutants, error-prone PCR was performed using pMopac 12-NlpA-fcyriia (MG 2a28, MG2a 45) -FLAG as template. Random point mutations were introduced into fc\u03b3riia region using an error-prone PCR technique of Taq polymerase (Takara). PCR was performed so that the two mutants MG2A28 and MG2A45 were present in the library at the same ratio of 50%: 50%. Point mutations were introduced into 0.3% of the nucleotides of the total FcgammaRIIA gene using MJ#160 and MJ#161 primers. Then, by treatment with SfiI restriction enzyme, ligation and transformation into Jude1 (pool size: 2.6X10)  <sup>9</sup> Experimental error rate: 0.32%) to construct fcyriia library.
