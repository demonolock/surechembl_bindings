    "Brief Summary of the Invention</p>\n  [0017] The subject invention pertains to tumor cell lines useful for increasing the proliferation potential of cells, including cultures of human and other animal cells. The subject invention particularly pertains to a rat thyroid cell line (UCHT1) useful for increasing the proliferation potential of cells. The subject invention also concerns conditioned medium prepared from such tumor cell lines, and other tumor cell line extracts. The conditioned medium of the invention can be used to produce immortalized or continuous cell lines. The invention further pertains to the cell lines immortalized using the conditioned medium of the subject invention.</p>\n  [0018] In a further aspect, the subject invention concerns a proliferation factor obtainable from a tumor cell line, such as the UCHT1 cell line, as well as methods of using a tumor cell line, its proliferation factor, tumor cell line conditioned medium, and/or other tumor cell line extracts, to increase the proliferation potential of cells. The proliferation factor is obtainable from tumor cells lines of various species, particularly mammalian species, such as rats and humans. The subject invention also concerns cell lines immortalized using a tumor cell line proliferation factor, or using compositions (e.g., conditioned medium and/or other tumor cell line \n\nextracts) containing such tumor cell line proliferation factors. In a specific embodiment, the proliferation factor is from about 30 kD to about 100 kD. The subject invention further pertains to fragments, analogues, or derivatives of the full-length tumor cell line proliferation factor. The methods of the subject invention can be used to enhance the proliferation potential of cells, including proliferation duration and/or proliferation rate. For example, the methods of the subject invention produce cell lines that proliferate indefinitely, and intervals between consecutive divisions of a cell as little as 24 hours can be achieved. Further, the cells of the subject invention can be grown in large-scale culture and cryopreserved with full retention of viability in vitro and in vivo.</p>\n  [0019] In another aspect, the subject invention concerns methods for transplanting cells to a patient in need thereof. These methods can be used for alleviating the symptoms of a variety of disorders or trauma by administering proliferated cells of the invention to a patient (e.g., a human or other animal) in need thereof. For example, proliferated cells of the subject invention can be administered to a patient suffering from a pathological condition, such as a condition associated with cell death, cell loss, or cell dysfunction. Advantageously, using the methods of the subject invention, immortality can be confened to cell lines without the necessity for incorporation of an oncogene. Therefore, the majority of proliferated cell lines produced by the methods of the subject invention are non-tumorgenic in vivo.</p>\n  [0020] The proliferate",

Figure 21B shows RCSN-3 cells in the presence of MPP<sup>4\"</sup>.</p>\n  [0048] Figures 22 A and 22B show the ratio of emission of JC-1 monomer versus emission of \"J\" aggregate (Em(520nm)/Em(590nm)) in RCSN-3 cells.</p>\n  [0049] Figures 23A and 23B show the results of melanin experiments conducted on RCSN-3 cells in the presence or absence of levodopa (L-Dopa). Figure 23 A shows experimental results using four experimental conditions: (i) plastic dishes in the absence of L-Dopa; (ii) plastic dishes in the presence of L-Dopa; (iii) glass dishes in the absence of L-Dopa; and (iv) glass dishes in the presence of L-Dopa. Figure 23B shows a one-way analysis of variance (ANONA) summary table (top) and a Student's t-Test summary table (bottom).</p>\n  [0050] Figure 24 shows SDS-PAGE demonstrating expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BD\u039dF) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in cells of the Hlb cell line \n\n(normal fetal mouse hippocampal cells with neuronal phenotype), which were previously cultured in UCHTl conditioned medium, and were either proliferating (P) or differentiated (D).</p>\n  [0051] Figure 25 shows SDS- PAGE dyed with Coomassie blue stain at every saturation level in precipitation with ammonium sulfate, as shown in Table 5. The first column contains molecular weight markers. Figure 25 shows that the main components are located at approximately 65 kD and 15 kD, which are associated with albumin and lactoalbumin, respectively. Most protein precipitates at 65%-80% of saturation with ammonium sulfate, but there are a greater number of proteins in the range of 40%-50% and 50%-65%. Theoretically, thyroglobulin precipitates at 40%-50%.</p>\n  [0052] Figure 26 shows curves associated with samples in ionic exchange chromatography. Although scales are not comparable, the sensitivity of the method is determined by the major components. The curve of serum and culture media may have slight differences due to the presence of amino acids and salts in the basal media. Greater differences between conditioned media and culture media would suggest the presence of secreted proteins. However, after conecting for actual protein content, no significant differences were found to justify a direct comparative analysis.</p>\n  [0053] Figure 27 shows anionic exchange chromatography (DEAE cellulose). Buffer solutions are Bis-Tris 20mM pH 7 for balance and binding, and Bis-Tris 20mM pH 7 1M NaCl for elution, considering 20 volumes of column. When compared to Figure 26, the patterns for transferrin and bovine serum albumin (BSA) are clearly identifiable in fractions 10 and 13-22, respectively. A break exists in the peak for BSA, related to the maintenance of a 20% gradient of the molarity of the salt.</p>\n  [0054] Figure 28 shows anionic exchange chromatography (DEAE cellulose). The resolution between pure albumin and transferrin is 1.7, which is less than tha",

The subject invention also concerns conditioned medium prepared from such tumor cell lines, which can also be used to produce immortalized or continuous cell lines. The invention further pertains to cell lines immortalized using conditioned medium of the subject invention.</p>\n  [0061] In a further aspect, the subject invention concerns a proliferation factor produced by tumor cell lines, and methods of using tumor cell lines, their proliferation factor, conditioned medium, and/or other tumor cell line extracts, to increase the proliferation potential of cells. The subject invention also concerns cell lines immortalized using a tumor cell line proliferation factor, or using compositions (e.g., conditioned medium and/or other tumor cell line extracts) containing such tumor cell line proliferation factors. Conditioned medium can include medium in which the tumor cell lines of the subject invention (e.g., UCHTl) have been grown, wherein \n\nthe proliferation factor is secreted or is otherwise delivered to the medium by the tumor cell line. In a specific embodiment, the proliferation factor is from about 30 kD to about 100 kD. The subject invention further pertains to polypeptides representing fragments, analogues, or derivatives of the full-length tumor cell line proliferation factor, or fusion proteins comprising such sequences, wherein the polypeptides retain some or all of the characteristic proliferating activity of the tumor cell line proliferation factors disclosed herein. The methods of the subject invention can be used to produce continuous cell lines that proliferate indefinitely. Many of these propagated cell lines have been maintained in vitro for one year and longer, and some for over 10 years, with retention of their differentiation markers. Using the methods of the present invention, it is possible to achieve a cell division period as little as 24 hours, or less.</p>\n  [0062] The cells of the subject invention can be grown in large-scale culture and cryopreserved with substantial retention of viability. Advantageously, using the methods of the subject invention, cells can be transformed and continuous cell lines can be created without the necessity for incorporation of an oncogene within the target cell line. Hence, a tumor cell line, its proliferation factor, conditioned medium or other extract obtained from a tumor cell line, permits enhanced and/or sustained proliferation of a target cell. The tumor cell line can be derived from a wide variety of mammal species, including human. In one embodiment, the tumor cell line is a thyroid tumor cell line. In another embodiment, the tum",
    "ng normal development, and the combination of Shh and FGF-8 can induce neurons with a dopaminergic phenotype in ectopic regions along the anterior neural tube (Ye, W. et al, Cell, 1998, 93:755-766). Cells of the subject invention (e.g., fibroblasts) can be genetically modified to produce Shh and/or FGF-8 for therapeutic, manufacturing, or research purposes. For example, such genetically modified cells can be administered to a patient to significantly increase the number of surviving co-administered dopaminergic neurons (Yurek, D.M. et al, Cell Transplantation, 2001, 10:665-671).</p>\n  [00138] Stem cells can be genetically modified, then subsequently proliferated using the methods of the subject invention. Alternatively, stem cells can be proliferated using the methods of the subject invention, then subsequently genetically modified.</p>\n  [00139] Non-stem cells (e.g., specialized or mature cells, and their precursor or progenitor cells) can be genetically modified, then subsequently proliferated using methods of the subject invention. Alternatively, non-stem cells can be proliferated using the methods of the subject invention, then subsequently genetically modified.</p>\n  Proliferation Factor and Receptor</p>\n  [00140] There are at least two possible mechanisms for the activity of the tumor cell line proliferation factor described herein, which are not necessarily mutually exclusive. These mechanisms include, for example, phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) or inhibition CKIs (CDK inhibitors); and/or interaction with telomerase or other DNA repair mechanisms (e.g., ligases), impairing normal DNA repair without compromising function. A further aspect of the subject invention includes methods of modulating the growth cycle of a cell or cells. Possible target cells include those described herein with respect to other methods of the subject invention. Modulation of a cell's growth cycle can be canied out by contacting or otherwise exposing the cells to the tumor cell line proliferation factor (including biologically active fragments or analogues thereof), agonists of the proliferation factor receptor, or functional antagonists of the proliferation factor receptor, such as antagonistic antibodies. Such agonists and antagonists may operate directly or indirectly on the proliferation factor receptor, and/or within the proliferation pathway. \n\n [00141] The UCHTl proliferation factor and its receptor are merely exemplary of other tumor cell line proliferation factors and conesponding proliferation factor receptors of the subject invention. Thus, the subject invention also includes variant or equivalent tumor cell line proliferation factors and proliferation factor receptors, such as the homologous human proliferation factor and proliferation factor receptor. Variant or equivalent tumor cell line proliferation factors and receptors (and nucleotide sequences coding for equivalent proliferation factors and receptors) have the same or similar a",
    "For differentiation, the cells were kept in a media consisting of DMEM/Ham F12 nutrient mixture, supplemented with 2% adult bovine serum and 1% (v/v) of N3 supplement as previously described (Cardenas A.M. et al, Neuroreport, 1999, 10(2):363- 369) and 1% (v/v) Site+3 supplement (SIGMA). Cells were allowed to differentiate for one week.</p>\n  [00163] Cytology of RCSN-3 cell line. Cells were fixed in formaldehyde 4% in phosphate buffer pH 7.4. Cytochemical reactions included: Hematoxilin-eosin staining, fenous ion capture to demonstrate the presence of melanin in the form of neuromelanin, paraformaldehyde-glyoxylate staining to demonstrate the prbsence of catecholamines.</p>\n  [00164] Immunohistochemistrv of RCSN-3 cell line. Fixed cells were permeabilized in an ascending/descending alcohol battery ranging from 50% to 96%. The blocking reaction was canied out using BSA 1% in phosphate buffer. The antibodies utilized were: (i) neuronal markers: NSE (pre-diluted, BIOGENEX) Synaptophysin (pre-diluted, BIOGENEX), MAP-2 (1 :1000, SIGMA); (ii) glial markers: GFAP (pre-diluted, BIOGENEX), S-100 (pre-diluted, BIOGENEX); and (iii) functional markers: TH (1:1000-1:1500, SIGMA). The incubation with the primary antibodies was canied out overnight and an ABC detection kit (BIOGENEX) was used to develop the reaction and utilizing DAB as chromogen. Specific primary antibodies, \n\nfluorescein labeled secondary antibodies and tetanus toxin were used to evaluate the presence of neurofilament 200 kD and tetanus toxin receptor.</p>\n  [00165] Intracellular Ca<sup>24\"</sup> measurements. For intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements, the cells were replated onto 35 mm culture dishes. The variations of intracellular Ca were assessed by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-imaging techniques using Fluro-3. The cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 40-60 minutes with the indicator. The dishes were visualized in an OLYMPUS BH2 microscope equipped with epifluorescence (halogen lamp). The microscope was connected to a Cooled Extended Isis digital camera (PHOTONIC SCIENCE, Ltd, Robertsbridge, UK) connected to a dedicated PC equipped with an AXON DIGIDATA 2000 digitizing board (AXON Instruments, Foster City, CA). Images were acquired at 12 bit resolution and 1Hz using customized software AXON Imaging Workbench 2.1.80 (AXON). The compositions of the normal extracellular solutions were (in mM): 135 or 145 NaCl, 5 KC1, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.5 or 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 4-(2-hidroxyethil) piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES)-NaOH, 10 Dextrose (pH=7.4).</p>\n  [00166] Surgical procedures and behavioral testing. Four adult male Fisher 344 rats (200-250 g) were lesioned by unilateral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine bromide at two sites along the medial forebrain bundle. Assessment of apomorphine induced rotational behavior (i.p. injection of 5 mg apomorphine per kg body weight, National Health Service, Chile) was canied out visually twice, once per week, before transplantation. Only rats with more than 160 ",
    "ps was preferable.</p>\n  [00172] Protein content in UCHTl conditioned media. Protein was determined by the Bradford method with modifications (Deutscher, M. P. [1990] \"Guide to Protein Purification- \n\nMethods in enzymology\" Academic Press, Inc., 182), using Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. BSA (SIGMA) was used for standardization. An ULTRASPEC 3000 spectrophotometer (PHARMACIA BIOTECH) was used. Exceptionally, protein was determined by the bicinconinic acid method, using a Protein assay kit (PIERCE).</p>\n  [00173] Bio Assay of UCHTl conditioned media fractions. The selection of an adequate bioassay to detect transformation with the various fractions of UCHTl media collected was desired. The cell lines used were the KGFR cell line, the NRK 52E cell line, and the human nueroblastoma cell line. The KGFR cell line was derived from the mouse fibroblast 3T3 cell line, and transfected with the receptor for EGF. The cells grow attached to surfaces, in media composed of DMEM/F12 (1:1) (SIGMA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and passaged with standard trypsinization. The KGFR cell line was used to establish a soft agar and a liquid media assay to test fractions of the UCHTl conditioned media. The NRK 52E cell line (ATCC:CRL-1571), derived from normal kidney epithelia of a rat (Rattus norvegicus). The NRK 52E cell line expresses receptors for EGF and multiplication stimulating activity (MSA), and grows attached to surfaces. NRK 52E cells are not transformed and exhibit contact inhibition in culture, a fundamental property in assays of transformation and malignancy. The cells grow in DMEM/F12 1:1 media (SIGMA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Passages were done with standard trypsinization. Split ratio 1 :3-4, with media renewals twice a week. Human neuroblastoma cells derived from an explant of tissue were derived from a biopsy of a patient and subsequently cultured. The cells grow adhered to substrate in DMEM/F12 1:1 media (SIGMA) supplemented with 10% FBS, 10% adult serum and NGF (CALBIOCHEM) lOng/ml. They were later adapted to 10% adult serum, 7.5% FBS and 5ng/ml NGF.</p>\n  [00174] Soft Agar Technique for purification and characterization of UCHTl proliferation factor. This technique conelates in 90% to transformation, and is faster and less costly than working with animal models such as the Nude mouse to detect tumorogenicity. Cells are grown in soft agar for a week, and colonies are the evidenced with dyes. Cells growing on this environment due so independently of anchoring, which conelated with a transformed phenotype. The protocol for the soft agar technique is as follows: (1) dilute agar 5% 10 times in culture media, to final concentration: 0.5%; (2) add 0.7 ml agar 0.5% to 3.5cm diameter culture \n\ndishes (base); (3) mix 0.2 ml cell suspension (Approx. 3xl0<sup>4</sup> cells/ml) per dish; (4) 0.7 ml agar 0.3% is placed over the base agar, and the dishes are kept in the incubator for 1 week (37\u00b0C, 100% humidity, 10% CO2); (5) ",
    ". and Stanbury J.B., (1976). \n\nExample 2\u2014 Preparation of UCHTl Conditioned Medium (UCHTl -CM)</p>\n  [00184] Glass Petri dishes (15 cm diameter) were inoculated with approximately 5xl0<sup>5</sup> mycoplasma free UCHTl cells (as described in Example 1) in a mixed solution consisting of equal volumes of Ham F<sub>12</sub> and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (F<sub>12</sub>/D) supplemented with 10% bovine serum, 2.5% fetal bovine serum, 0.015M HEPES (n-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2 ethane sulfonic acid) buffer pH 7.2, 50 mg/1 streptomycin sulphate and 100 mg/1 sodium- penicillin-G, which was used as the basal growing medium (BGM). Cultures were incubated at 36\u00b0C, 100% humidity in an incubator with controlled 10% CO<sub>2</sub>, 90% air atmosphere and total media changes every three days. UCHTl -CM was collected from exponentially growing cultures and harvested from four subsequent culture periods of 24 hours, obtaining a total amount of 80 mL per dish at the end of the four days; the extensive cell detachment after confluence prevents further UCHTl -CM collection. Finally, UCHTl -CM was filtered through 0.2 \u03bcm German SUPOR-200 nitrocellulose membranes and stored frozen at -20\u00b0C.</p>\n  Example 3 \u2014 Immortalized Skeletal Muscle Cell Line</p>\n  [00185] A cell line (RCMH) in permanent culture was established from surgically removed adult normal human skeletal muscle by exposure to conditioned media obtained from thyroid cells. Cells proliferated indefinitely but displayed density inhibition of growth while maintaining some differentiated markers. Under certain incubation conditions, cells fused into myotube-like structures, with a concomitant increase in muscle specific proteins, such as human myoglobin, skeletal muscle myosin, desmin and dystrophin, as identified using immunocytochemical procedures. In addition, RCMH cells displayed high affinity receptors for \u03b1-bungarotoxin (B<sub>max</sub> = 0.7 pmol/mg protein, K = 1.5 nM) and dihydropyridines (B<sub>max</sub> = 0.3 pmol/mg protein, Kd = 0.5 nM for [ H]PN200-110). These values are comparable to those reported for normal muscle cells in primary culture. Patch-clamp studies showed the presence of 42 pS carbachol gated channels and of 5 pS calcium channels (current carried by barium); chloride and potassium channels were also seen. Details regarding establishment of culture, culture conditions, immunocytochemical procedures, binding experiments, and single channel \n\nrecording carried out on the RCMH cell line, and results, are described in Caviedes, R. et al, Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 1992, 1134:247-255.</p>\n  Example 4 \u2014 Immortalized Cerebellar Cell Line</p>\n  [00186] Ten Fisher, 6-month-old female rats were injected with 10<sup>6</sup> UCHTl cells subcutaneously. After developing a tumor within 3 months, the animals were anesthetized and portions of cerebellar cortex were dissected and placed on watch glasses containing a mixture 1:1 of Eagles modified Dulbecco's and Ham's F12 media (GRAND ISLAND BIOL. Co., NY, U.S.A.) without serum. Cerebellar explants of approximately 1mm<sup>3</sup> were prepared, placed in glass petri dishes and allowed to and grow in the same medium mixture containing 15% bovine, 2.5% fetal bovine serum, 0.015 H M Hepes buffer, pH 7.2, plus 50 mg/1 streptomycin sulphate, 100 mg/1 sodium-penicillin-G and sufficient glucose for a total amount of 6 g/1. Cultured explants were incubated at 36\u00b0C, 100% humidity. Clones were isolated from cerebellar established cultures at the 25th pas",
    "rate tritiated iodine.</p>\n  Example 8 \u2014 Immortalized RCSN-3 Cell Line and Transplantation into Rat Striatum</p>\n  [00200] Primary cultures of the RCSN-3 cell line, derived from the substantia nigra of an adult rat, were grown in the presence of UCHTl conditioned media. The RCSN-3 cell line was grown on monolayers, with a doubling time of 52 hours, a plating efficiency of 21% and a saturation density of 410,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>, when kept in feeding medium. Figures 2A-2F show that undifferentiated RCSN cells tend to exhibit an epithelial like morphology, with short or no processes and a more acidophylic cytoplasm. After differentiation, cell proliferation is greatly reduced, and the RCSN cells develop processes and establish contact with neighboring cells. The presence of melanin was evidenced with the fenous ion capture technique, demonstrating a homogenous distribution of the pigment in the cytoplasm, with faint labeling in undifferentiated stages and a substantial increase upon differentiation.</p>\n  [00201] Immunohistochemical characterization demonstrated that RCSN cells express neuronal traits, evidenced by the positive immunolabelling for NSE, synaptophysin and MAP-2. NSE and synaptophysin show a fine granular pattern evenly distributed in the cytoplasm, as shown in Figures 3A-3H. Synaptophysin is especially intense at the zone of cell-cell interaction. MAP-2 shows a fibrillary pattern of labeling, sunounding vacuole-like cytoplasmic \"structures. Neurofilament 200 kD labeled differentiated cells homogenously, and tetanus toxin is present in the cell membrane in a patch-like distribution. Functional neuronal markers are shown in Figures 4A and 4B, which present immunohistochemical staining for tyrosine hydroxylase. The labeling is slightly less intense in non-differentiated cells, and the label is distributed in the entire cytoplasm following a granular pattern. The presence of catecholamines is also clear from the micrographs presented in Figure 4C and 4D, with a cytoplasmic distribution. Glial markers \n\nGFAP and SI 00 were negative in both control and differentiated conditions. When differentiated, up to 40% of Fluo-3 loaded RCSN cells responded with increases in Ca<sup>24\"</sup> when stimulated externally with 200 \u03bcm glutamate, and even more intensely when using simultaneous depolarizing conditions (70mM K<sup>4\"</sup>), a situation depicted in Figures 5. Of 16 cells explored, the Ca<sup>24\"</sup> signal peaks after one second of stimulation, and returns to basal level between 30-40 seconds after the peak. These experiments show that the RCSN-3 clonal cell line retains general properties of neuronal tissue, and possesses specific characteristics of the SN, such as the presence of tyrosine hydroxylase, DOPA decarboxylase, and catecholamines.</p>\n  [00202] Suspensions of RCSN cells were transplanted into the striatum of rats with 6- OH dopamine-induced lesions of the substantia nigra. Figures 6A and 6B show typical patterns in the evol",
    "ere appropriate neuritic outgrowth within the striatum is expected to be observed (Schultzberg, M. et al, Neurosci, 1984, 12:17-32).</p>\n  [00235] Thus, this method, as opposed to other methods known in the art, uses human nigral tissue as the starting tissue, rather than rodent nigral tissue, permitting the creation of an allogenic cell line that can be used clinically without a need for immunosuppression. Also, graft- derived neuritic outgrowth from a human-derived cell line is anticipated to be significantly greater than that from a rodent or porcine cell line.</p>\n  [00236] Another aspect of the invention is a method for creating a GABAergic (gamma- aminobutyric acid-producing) proliferated cell line that is transplantable in multiple patients having Huntington's disease, and also for creating such a cell line for use in other diseases where transplantation of GABAergic cells is useful, such as in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, schizophrenia, spinal cord injury, stroke, or other neurodegenerative diseases (Winkler, C. et al. , Experimental Neurology, 1999, 155:165-186).</p>\n  [00237] In Parkinson's disease, transplantation of GABAergic neurons into the subthalamic nucleus is beneficial in inhibiting output from this nucleus and ameliorates some symptoms or other movement disorders. In the case of epilepsy, transplants around a seizure focus, or in other regions of the eleptogenic pathway suppress, seizure activity. In the case of schizophrenia, GABAergic inhibition of the ventral tegmental area dopaminergic projections down-regulates the dopamine input to the frontal and mesolimbic cortex and diminishes the symptoms. Following a stroke involving the striatum, striatal transplants can provide clinical benefit, as has been demonstrated in similar animal models.</p>\n  [00238] Stable human GABAergic neuronal lines that retain differentiated properties in continuous culture can be constructed by exposing human neonatal, adolescent, adult, or fetal striatum to the UCHTl proliferation factor, e.g., via UCHTl conditioned medium, as taught \n\nherein. For example, human adult striatum or far lateral ventricular eminence tissue can be exposed to UCHTl conditioned medium. Fetal tissue is preferably derived from a human embryo with a donor stage of approximately 7.5-9 weeks post-conception.</p>\n  [00239] After exposure, stable, proliferating differentiated cell lines are derived from the cell types found in the far lateral ventricular eminence. GABAergic and cholinergic cell types, among others found in the developing striatum, can be found within the different clones in the culture. Cell lines of each type of neuronal phenotype found can be created. Cells can be characterized using immunohistochemical methods known in the art. Two different striatal GABAergic cell lines can be created, one that co-labels with CCK and one that co-labels with enkaphalin (ENK), representing two different classes of GABAergic projection neurons found in the s",
    "resence of the hormone by itself seems insufficient to induce transformation since no cell transformation or tumor promotion has been documented in response to the sole effect of the hormone, and therefore the simultaneous presence of known and unknown growth factors is required.</p>\n  [00250] As described herein, the UCHTl cell line has been shown to release one or more factors (e.g., in culture media) that are capable of inducing proliferation and later immortalization in primary cell cultures, with preservation of hystotypic and functional properties. Conditioned media derived from cell lines established by the UCHTl conditioned media (e.g., RCMH, RCVC, and UCHCC1), and other clonal cell lines (e.g., NIH3T3, PTK2, MDCK and KFR) do not show proliferating or transforming activities when added to primary cultures.</p>\n  [00251] Crude UCHTl conditioned media, ultra-centrifuged at high supernatant speed (HSS) at 100,000 rpm for 3 hours, and filtered through 0.2 \u03bcm cellulose acetate membranes, stimulate cell proliferation and DNA synthesis in several human, canine, murine, and rat primary cultures and cell lines. In primary cultures of a dysgenic human neuroblastoma and embryonic brain of C57BI fetal mice, the appearance of transformation foci in periods of 20 to 30 days was detected, which evidenced chromosomal abnormalities. The same UCHTl -conditioned media HSS preparation, when ultra-filtered in CENTRICON (AMICON) molecular filter membranes, at cut levels of 10, 20, and 100 kD, the pro-proliferating activity was recovered in the 30-100 kD range. The fraction proved very stable (thermoresistant; resistant to trypsin). Precipitation of the soluble, 0.2 \u03bcm filtered, UCHTl -conditioned media HSS preparation, with acetone 25%, 40%, 50%, 60%, and 80%, shows that the fraction of 40% retained the greatest proliferation inducing activity, using KGFR cells growing in serum free conditions (Figures 25 and 32A-D). Differences with culture media and animal sera are present when using ionic exchange chromatography (Figure 26), where UCHTl media exhibits a larger peak at approximately 11 ml, suggesting the presence of secreted protein. Anionic chromatography gives values of \n\n resolutions for pure albumin and transfenin of 1.7, which is less than that seen for UCHTl conditioned media (Figures 27 and 28), suggesting the presence of proteins other than these two. Further, ioselectric focusing gels indicate albumin predominates as a protein in conditioned media, the attenuation in the extremities of the peak suggest the presence of other protein, but the resolution is insufficient to discriminate them (Figure 29). Hydrophobic interaction chromatography of conditioned media gives a pattern similar to the combination of transfenin and albumin, with slight differences in conespondence, which could be due to non-specific protein interactions (Figures 30 and 31).</p>\n  \n    <img id=\"imgf000079_0001\" path=\"imgf000079_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/3136036/WO/20030814/A2/002003/06/59/99/imgf000079_0001"
