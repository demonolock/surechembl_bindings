Post- translational modification of a composition containing a peptide results in a modulation of the rate and efficiency of cleavage of the modified peptide by a protease as compared to the non-modified peptide. The attachment of at least one detectable moiety to the peptide in the composition couples the cleavage of the peptide in the composition to a change in a detectable property of the composition that can be used to monitor post- translational activity in a sample and to assay for modulators of a post-translational activity. See FIG. 1. Compositions of the present invention can be used in assay methods, particularly methods for high-throughput and miniaturized screening systems for drug discovery and profiling. In addition, methods and kits described herein typically exhibit a large dynamic range, high Z'-factor values, and increased sensitivity by employing a ratiometric analysis to eliminate well-to-well variations. Finally, methods of the present invention can be performed under near initial velocity conditions and produce accurate IC50 data for kinase and phosphatase inhibitors. \n\n Definitions Generally, the nomenclature used herein and many of the fluorescence, computer, detection, chemistry, and laboratory procedures described herein are commonly employed in the art. Abbreviations: t-Boc, tert-butyloxycarbonyl; Bzl, benzyl; CaMK, calmodulin dependent kinase; CKI, casein kinase 1; PDGF, platelet derived growth factor; Fmoc, fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl; EGF, epidermal growth factor; ELISA, enzyme-linked immuno absorbant assay; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; HF, hydrogen fluoride; HOBT, N-Hydroxybenzotriazole; PyBop, Benzotriazole- 1 -yl-oxy-tris-pyyrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate; TFA, trifluoroacteic acid; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; RET, resonance energy transfer; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; FAM, carboxyfluorescein. As employed throughout the disclosure, the following terms, unless otherwise indicated, shall be understood to have the following meanings: The term \"RET\" means resonance energy transfer, and refers to the radiationless transmission of an energy quantum from its site of absorption to the site of its utilization in a molecule, or system of molecules, by resonance interaction between chromophores, over distances considerably greater than interatomic, without substantial conversion to thermal energy, and without the donor and acceptor coming into kinetic collision. A donor is a moiety that initially absorbs energy (e.g., optical energy), and an acceptor is the"
