    "d below according to literature methods (Mishra, A.; Kaushik, N. K.; Verma, A. K.; Gupta, R. Eur. J. Med. Chem. 2008, 43, 2189-2196).</p>The preparations of the ligand L and [HL]Cl described herein were based on the methods published by Boyd, Zafar and Wright (Boyd, P. D.; Wright, L. J.; Zafar, M. N. Inorg. Chem. 2011, 50, 10522-10524).</p>The myoglobin used in the assays to detect carbon monoxide release was isolated from equine skeletal muscle and was used as purchased from Sigma Aldrich.</p>1.2 Instruments and Reaction Conditions UsedNMR spectra were measured on a Bruker DRX-400 spectrometer at 25\u00b0 C. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm. All spectra were recorded in deuterated chloroform (CDCl<sub>3</sub>) or deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (d<sup>6</sup>-DMSO) with <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra being referenced to the proteo-impurity in d<sup>6</sup>-DMSO (\u03b4=2.50 ppm) or the proteo-impurity in CDCl<sub>3 </sub>(\u03b4=7.26 ppm). The <sup>13</sup>C{<sup>1</sup>H} NMR spectra were also referenced to d<sup>6</sup>-DMSO (\u03b4=39.5 ppm) or CDCl<sub>3 </sub>(\u03b4=77.2 ppm). Infrared spectra were recorded in the range of 4000 to 380 cm<sup>\u22121 </sup>on a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum 400 spectrometer using an ATR accessory or on a Bruker Vertex 70 using an ATR accessory. Elemental analyses of nitrogen, carbon and hydrogen were obtained from the Microanalytical Laboratory at the University of Otago, Dunedin. High resolution mass spectrometry was recorded on a Bruker MicrOTOF-QII instrument coupled with a KD scientific syringe pump using electrospray ionisation. UV-visible spectra were obtained on an Ocean Optics spectrometer running spectra suite software.</p>Unless stated all reactions were carried out at room temperature under an atmosphere of nitrogen. Solvents used were of analytical grade apart from dichloromethane, diethyl ether and n-hexane which were purified using an LC Technology Solutions SP-1 stand-alone solvent purification system. In addition, methanol was dried over 4 \u212b molecular sieves and stored in a Schlenk tube under a nitrogen atmosphere prior to use.</p>1.3 CharacterisationAssignments of bands in the IR spectrum were made by considering the relative absorption frequencies in cm-1 to those of similar compounds in the literature where possible.</p>Assignments of signals in the NMR spectra were made based on chemical shift positions (in ppm) in the <sup>1</sup>H NMR, <sup>13</sup>C NMR and <sup>31</sup>P NMR spectra as well as the integral values in the <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum. Assignment was also made based on two dimensional <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>1</sup>H (COSY) and <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C (HSQC and HMBC) spectra.</p>2. Example 1This example describes the synthesis of the complex of invention [Ru(CO)<sub>3</sub>Cl(L)][Ru(CO)<sub>3</sub>Cl<sub>3</sub>] (pH-CORM-1).</p>2.1 1-Benzyl-4-(picolinamido)pyridinium chloride ([HL]Cl)<img id=\"EMI-C00023\" path=\"US20180273564A1-20180927-C00023.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/458745357/US/20"
