{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that contain all four required components: a specific molecule name, a bioactivity metric (IC50, Ki, Kd, EC50), a specific numeric value for that metric, and a unit for that value. The text appears to be focused on the clinical use and effects of various medications, particularly pramipexole and olanzapine, but does not provide specific bioactivity data."}
