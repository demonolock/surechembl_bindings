    "A 22 year-old female suffered from bipolar I disorder, with panic attacks and borderline personality disorder similar to Example 15. The only agent that had worked previously for mania was olanzapine, which was refused because the patient had previously gained 23 pounds.</p>\n  [0071] The patient agreed to a trial with a combination of olanzapine 2.5 - 5 mg per day and pramipexole 0.125 - 0.25 mg per day, and did not experience weight gain. However, she could not continue with the pramipexole due to cost, and immediately gained weight. As a result, olanzapine was discontinued and the patient was hospitalized.</p>\n  [0072] As will be apparent to those skilled in the art in the light of the foregoing disclosure, may alterations and modifications are possible in the practice of the invention without departing from the spirit or scope thereof. It is therefore intended that the following appended claims and claims hereafter introduced are interpreted to include all such alterations and modifications as are within their true scope. \n\n ENDNOTES</p>\n  1.
