    "00130] In one embodiment, the bromodomain-containing protein is a BET protein. </p>[00131] In a further embodiment, the BET protein is BRD4. </p> [00132] In another embodiment, the disorder is a proliferative disorder, inflammatory disease, sepsis, autoimmune disease, or viral infection. </p> [00133] In a further embodiment, the proliferative disorder is cancer. </p>[00134] In certain embodiments, the cancer is adenocarcinoma, adult T-cell </p>leukemia/lymphoma, bladder cancer, blastoma, bone cancer, breast cancer, brain cancer, carcinoma, myeloid sarcoma, cervical cancer, colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer, </p>gastrointestinal cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, glioma, gallbladder cancer, gastric cancer, head and neck cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, intestinal cancer, kidney cancer, laryngeal cancer, leukemia, lung cancer, lymphoma, liver cancer, small cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, mesothelioma, multiple myeloma, ocular cancer, optic nerve tumor, oral cancer, ovarian cancer, pituitary tumor, primary central nervous system lymphoma, prostate \n\n cancer, pancreatic cancer, pharyngeal cancer, renal cell carcinoma, rectal cancer, sarcoma, skin cancer, spinal tumor, small intestine cancer, stomach cancer, T-cell lymphoma, testicular cancer, thyroid cancer, throat cancer, urogenital cancer, urothelial carcinoma, uterine cancer, vaginal cancer, or Wilms' tumor. </p> [00135] Compounds and compositions described herein are generally useful for the inhibition of activity of one or more proteins involved in epigenetic regulation. Thus, in some </p>embodiments, the present invention provides a method of inhibiting one or more proteins involved in epigenetic regulation, such as proteins containing acetyl-lysine recognition motifs, also known as bromodomains (e.g., BET proteins, such as BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and/or BRDT), by administering a provided compound or composition. </p> [00136] Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene expression caused by </p>mechanisms other than changes in the underlying DNA sequence. Molecular mechanisms that play a role in epigenetic regulation include DNA methylation and chromatin/histone </p>modifications. Chromatin recognition, in particular, is critical in many epigenetic phenomena. </p>[00137] Chromatin, the organized assemblage of nuclear DNA and histone proteins, is the basis for a multitude of vital nuclear processes including regulation of transcription, replication, DNA-damage repair and progression through the cell cycle. A number of factors, such as chromatin-modifying enzymes, have been identified that play an important role in maintaining the dynamic equilibrium of chromatin (Margueron, et al. (2005) Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. </p>15:163-176). </p> [00138] Histones are the chief protein components of chromatin. They act as spools around which DNA winds, and they play a role in gene regulation. There are a total of six classes of histones (HI, H2A, H2B, H3, H4, and H5) organi",
    " basic unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, which consists of about 147 base pairs of DNA wrapped around the histone octamer, consisting of two copies each of the core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (Luger, et al. (1997) Nature 389:251-260). </p> [00139] Histones, particularly residues of the amino termini of histones H3 and H4 and the amino and carboxyl termini of histones H2A, H2B and HI, are susceptible to a variety of post-translational modifications including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ribosylation sumoylation, ubiquitination, citrullination, deimination, and biotinylation. The core of histones \n\n H2A and H3 can also be modified. Histone modifications are integral to diverse biological processes such as gene regulation, DNA repair, and chromosome condensation. </p>[00140] One type of histone modification, lysine acetylation, is recognized by </p>bromodomain-containing proteins. Bromodomain-containing proteins are components of transcription factor complexes and determinants of epigenetic memory (Dey, et al. (2009) Mol. Biol. Cell 20:4899-4909). There are 46 human proteins containing a total of 57 bromodomains discovered to date. One family of bromodomain-containing proteins, BET proteins (BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and BRDT) have been used to establish proof-of-concept for targeting </p>protein-protein interactions of epigenetic \"readers,\" as opposed to chromatin-modifying enzymes, or so-called epigenetic \"writers\" and \"erasers\" (Filippakopoulos, et al. \"Selective Inhibition of BET Bromodomains,\" Nature (published online September 24, 2010); Nicodeme, et al. \"Suppression of Inflammation by a Synthetic Histone Mimic,\" Nature (published online November 10, 2010)). </p> [00141] Examples of proteins inhibited by the compounds and compositions described herein and against which the methods described herein are useful include bromodomain-containing proteins, such as BET proteins, such as BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and/or BRDT, or an isoform or mutant thereof. </p> [00142] The activity of a provided compound, or composition thereof, as an inhibitor of a bromodomain-containing protein, such as a BET protein, such as BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and/or BRDT, or an isoform or mutant thereof, may be assayed in vitro, in vivo, or in a cell line. In vitro assays include assays that determine inhibition of bromodomain-containing proteins, such as BET proteins, such as BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and/or BRDT, or a mutant thereof. </p>Alternatively, inhibitor binding may be determined by running a competition experiment where a provided compound is incubated with a bromodomain-containing protein, such as a BET protein, such as BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and/or BRDT bound to known ligands, labeled or unlabeled. Detailed conditions for assaying a provided compound as an inhibitor of a </p>bromodomain-containing protein, such as a BET protein, such as BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and/or BRDT or a mutant thereof, are set forth in the Examples below. </p> [00143] The invention provides for a method of treating a subject with a MYC-dependent cancer, comprising: identifying a subject in need of treatment; administering to the subject a BET inhibitor; determining at least one of MYC mRNA expression, MYC protein expression \n\n and tumor mass, and wherein following administration, there is a decrease in at least one of myc mRNA expression, MYC protein expression and tumor mass, thereby treating the disease. </p>[00144] In one embodiment, the identification step comprises determining whether the subject has at least one of a MYC translocation, a genetic rearrangement of MYC, MYC amplification, MYC over-expression and at least one cellular function that facilitates cellular and/or tumor growth and is altered upon reduction of myc mRNA or protein expression. </p>[00145] The invention also provides for a metho",
    "llowing the administration, there is a decrease in at least one of myc mRNA expression, MYC protein expression and tumor mass, thereby treating the disease. </p> [00148] Acetylated histone recognition and bromodomain-containing proteins (such as BET proteins) have been implicated in proliferative disease. BRD4 knockout mice die shortly after implantation and are compromised in their ability to maintain an inner cell mass, and </p>heterozygotes display pre- and postnatal growth defects associated with reduced proliferation rates. BRD4 regulates genes expressed during M/Gl, including growth- associated genes, and remains bound to chromatin throughout the cell cycle (Dey, et al. (2009) Mol. Biol. Cell </p>20:4899-4909). BRD4 also physically associates with Mediator and P-TEFb (CDK9/cyclin Tl) to facilitate transcriptional elongation (Yang, et al. (2005) Oncogene 24:1653-1662; Yang, et al. (2005) Mol. Cell 19:535-545). CDK9 is a validated target in chronic lymphocytic leukemia \n\n (CLL), and is linked to c-Myc-dependent transcription (Phelps, et al. Blood 113:2637-2645; Rahl, et al. (2010) Cell 141:432-445). </p> [00149] BRD4 is translocated to the NUT protein in patients with lethal midline carcinoma, an aggressive form of human squamous carcinoma (French, et al. (2001) Am. J. Pathol. </p>159:1987-1992; French, et al. (2003) Cancer Res. 63:304-307). In vitro analysis with RNAi supports a causal role for BRD4 in this recurrent t(15;19) chromosomal translocation. </p>Pharmacologic inhibition of the BRD4 bromodomains results in growth arrest/differentiation of BRD4-NUT cell lines in vitro and in vivo (Filippakopoulos, et al. \"Selective Inhibition of BET Bromodomains,\" Nature (published online September 24, 2010)). </p> [00150] Bromodomain-containing proteins (such as BET proteins) have also been implicated in inflammatory diseases. BET proteins {e.g., BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and BRDT) regulate assembly of histone acetylation-dependent chromatin complexes that control inflammatory gene expression (Hargreaves, et al. (2009) Cell 138:129-145; LeRoy, et al. (2008) Mol. Cell 30:51-60; Jang, et al. (2005) Mol. Cell 19:523-534; Yang, et al. (2005) Mol. Cell 19:535-545). Key inflammatory genes (secondary response genes) are down-regulated upon bromodomain inhibition of the BET subfamily, and non-responsive genes (primary response genes) are poised for transcription. BET bromodomain inhibition protects against LPS-induced endotoxic shock and bacteria-induced sepsis in vivo (Nicodeme, et al. \"Suppression of Inflammation by a </p>Synthetic Histone Mimic,\" Nature (published online November 10, 2010)). </p>[00151] Bromodomain-containing proteins (such as BET proteins) also play a role in viral disease. For example, BRD4 is implicated in human papilloma virus (HPV). In the primary phase of HPV infection of basal epithelia, the viral genome is maintained in an </p>extra-chromosomal episome. In some strains of HPV, BRD4 binding to the HPV E2 protein functions to tether the viral genome to chromosomes. E2 is critical for both the repression of E6/E7 and the activation of HPV viral genes. Disruption of BRD4 or the BRD4-E2 interaction blocks E2-dependent gene activation. BRD4 also functions to tether other classes of viral genomes to host chromatin {e.g., Herpesvirus, Epstein-Barr virus). </p> [00152] As used herein, the terms \"treatment,\" \"treat,\" and \"treating\" refer to reversing, alleviating, delaying the onset of, or inhibiting the progress of a disease or disorder, or one or more symptoms thereof, as described herein. In some embodiments, treatment may be administered after one or more symptoms have developed. In other embodiments, treatment may \n\n be administered in the absence of symptoms. For example, treatment may be administered to a susceptible individual prior to the onset of symptoms (e.g., in light of a history of symptoms and/or in light of genetic ",
    "g., determining tumor size or screening for tumor markers where the cell proliferative disorder is cancer) and then administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention, to the subject. After an appropriate period of time after the administration of the compound (e.g., 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, one month, six months), the extent of the disorder is determined again. The modulation (e.g., decrease) of the extent or invasiveness of the disorder indicates efficacy of the treatment. The extent or invasiveness of the disorder may be determined periodically throughout treatment. For example, the extent or invasiveness of the disorder may be checked every few hours, days or weeks to assess the further efficacy of the treatment. A decrease in extent or invasiveness of the disorder indicates that the treatment is efficacious. The method described may be used to screen or select patients that may benefit from treatment with a compound of the invention. </p>[00166] The invention further relates to the use of provided compounds for the production of pharmaceutical compositions which are employed for the treatment and/or prophylaxis and/or amelioration of the diseases, disorders, illnesses and/or conditions as mentioned herein. </p>[00167] The invention further relates to the use of provided compounds for the production of pharmaceutical compositions which are employed for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of diseases and/or disorders responsive or sensitive to the inhibition of bromodomain-containing proteins, particularly those diseases mentioned above, such as e.g. cancer, inflammatory disease, viral disease. </p> [00168] Another object of the present invention is the use of a compound as described herein (e.g., of any formulae herein) in the manufacture of a medicament for use in the treatment of a disorder or disease herein.
