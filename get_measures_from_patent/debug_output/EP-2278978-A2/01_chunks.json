    "00 ms train of stimulation pulses was recorded for the EDL muscle. The muscle length was then measured with calipers and after removal of the muscle from the bath the mass of the muscle was determined. For each muscle, the optimum fiber length (L<sub>f</sub>) was calculated by multiplying L<sub>0</sub> by a previously determined L<sub>f</sub>/L<sub>o</sub> ratio of 0.45. Total muscle fiber cross-sectional area was determined by dividing the wet mass by the product of L<sub>f</sub> and the density of mammalian skeletal muscle (1.06 mg/mm<sup>3</sup>). Maximum isometric specific force (sP<sub>o</sub>) was determined by dividing P<sub>o</sub> by the total \n\n muscle fiber cross-sectional area. There was no statistically significant (P&lt;0.05) difference in specific force between untreated and prednisolone groups.</p>Table 5 - Effect of long term treatment of prednisolone and example compounds on in vitro EDL muscle force contractions.</p></p>Histological Evaluations</p>[0199] Hematoxylin and Eosin staining of gastrocnemius muscle of untreated mdx mice show significant degeneration and inflammation. Skeletal muscle from Example 1 - and Example 2-treated mice showed significant decrease in inflammation, degeneration, and increase in regenerating muscle fibers in comparison to untreated and prednisolone treated mdx mice. Continuous administration of prednisolone appeared to increase degeneration and decrease in regeneration of dystrophic skeletal muscle.</p>Glucocorticoid Receptor Binding Assay</p>[0200] To determine the receptor binding affinity of example compounds to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a ligand binding assay was performed using cDNA expression clones (Baculovirus) for human and mouse glucocorticoid receptor-alpha. Liver extracts containing different GR constructs were incubated with radiolabeled 3H- Dexamethsone (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and test compound in assay buffer ( 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1.5 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 20 mM sodium molybdate, pH 7.6). The amount of radioactivity was measured using a scintillation plate reader. Dexamethasone showed competitive binding with 3H-dexamethasone at micromolar concentrations. \n\n Table 5 - Percentage of .1 1 Dexamethasone Speci fic Rinding</p></p>[0201] From the foregoing description, one skilled in the art can easily ascertain the essential characteristics of this invention, and without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, can make various changes and modifications of the invention to adapt it to various usages and conditions. \n</p>"
