HDAC Biochemical Assay</p>[00306] The inhibitory effect of compounds on deacetylase isoenzyme function was determined in vitro using an optimized homogenous assay performed in 384-well plate format. In this assay, recombinant, full-length HDAC protein (HDACl 3.33 ng/\u03bcL, HDAC2 1 ng/\u03bcL, HDAC3/NCor2 0.17 ng/\u03bcL, HDAC6 1.3 ng/\u03bcL; BPS Biosciences) is incubated with a commercially-available fluorophore conjugated substrate at a concentration equivalent to the substrate K<sub>1n</sub> (Upstate 17-372; 6 \u03bcM for HDACl, 3 \u03bcM for HDAC2, 6 \u03bcM for HDAC3 and 16 \u03bcM for HDAC6). Reactions are performed in assay buffer (50 mM HEPES, 100 mM KCl, 0.001% Tween-20, 0.05% BSA, 200 \u03bcM TCEP, pH 7.4) and followed for fluorigenic release of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin from substrate upon deacetylase and trypsin enzymatic activity. Fluorescence measurements are obtained approximately every five minutes using a multilabel plate reader and plate-stacker (Envision; Perkin-Elmer). Data are analyzed on a plate-by-plate basis for the linear range of fluorescence over time. Data from the plate capture corresponding to the mid-linear range is imported into analytical software and annotated with well identity and compound concentration (Spotfire DecisionSite). Replicate experimental data from incubations with inhibitor are normalized to control, solvent-only wells and IC-50 is deteremined by logistic regression.</p>[00307] Thus, small-molecule inhibitors were arrayed at twelve -point dose-response</p>(3-fold increments) in 384-well library plates and transferred by robotic pin device to replicate assay plates containing assay buffer under reducing conditions (TCEP 200 \u03bcM). A liquid handling device then transferred a tripeptide substrate terminating in acetyl-lysine and amide conjugated to 4-methyl-7-aminocoumarin (AMC), recombinant human histone deacetylase (BPS Bioscience, San Diego, CA), and recombinant human trypsin (Sigma- Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Following deacetylase hydrolysis of acetyl-lysine, trypsin cleavage liberated the AMC fluorophore. Kinetic (fluorescence per unit time) and end-point (total fluorescence) data were captured by a multilabel plate reader. Replicate data were analyzed by curve-fit using logistic regression (Spotfire Decision-Site). A summary of assay data are in Table 4, below.</p>[00308] Table 4.
