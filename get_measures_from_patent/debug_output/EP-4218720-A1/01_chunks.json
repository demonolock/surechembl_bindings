    "plants were debribed excess tissue and were stored at -20 \u00b0C until analysis. The retrieved implants were analyzed for buprenorphine content using the implant analysis method described above.</p>Pharmacokinetics studies in large animals were performed in male beagle dogs. Male beagles with body weights between 8 to 12 kg were selected in these studies. Six dogs per group were injected subcutaneously in the dorsal thoracic region at a buprenorphine equivalent dose of 60 mg per dog. Exact injection doses were obtained by weighing the injection syringe before and after each injection. After injection, the dogs were bled periodically to collect their plasma samples. All plasma samples were stored in a -80 \u00b0C freezer until analysis. The animals were also watched periodically for any sign of toxicity as well as injection site reactions.</p>Buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine levels in dog plasma samples were measured using a validated LC/MS/MS method through a qualified contract analytical laboratory as described above.</p>Example 1 - 24-Hour Burst Release of Buprenorphine ATRIGEL<sup>\u2122</sup> in RatsEight buprenorphine ATRIGEL<sup>\u2122</sup> formulations were prepared according to the methods described above. The buprenorphine hydrochloride formulations had the two-syringe configuration and the buprenorphine free base formulations were solutions.
