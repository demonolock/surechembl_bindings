    "ides for \"consisting of\" aspects. Exemplarily, \"a composition comprising A and B\" should be understood as the following technical solutions: a composition consisting of A and B, and a composition containing other components in addition to A and B , all of which are within the scope of the aforementioned \"a composition\".</p>The term \"and/or\" as used herein includes the meanings of \"and\", \"or\" and \"all or any other combination of the elements linked by the associated term.\"</p>The term \"CD70\" herein, also known as \"TNFSF7\" or \"CD27L\", is a member of the TNF ligand family and is a ligand for CD27 (also known as TNFRSF27). \"CD70\" herein includes mature or immature full-length wild-type CD70 protein or mutants thereof (eg, point mutations, insertion mutations or deletion mutations), splice variants, orthologs (Orthologs) and the foregoing Fragment of CD70. \"CD70\" herein can be derived from humans, primates, such as monkeys (eg, rhesus monkeys, cynomolgus monkeys), and rodents, such as mice and rats. Exemplarily, the amino acid sequence of human CD70 can be found in UniProt number: P32970, and the amino acid sequence of rhesus monkey CD70 can be found in UniProt number: F7GPA5.</p>The term \"specifically binds\" herein refers to an antigen-binding molecule (eg, an antibody) that specifically binds an antigen and a substantially identical antigen, usually with high affinity, but does not bind with high affinity to an unrelated antigen. Affinity is usually reflected in the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD), where lower KD indicates higher affinity. Taking an antibody as an example, high affinity generally refers to having about <sup>10-7</sup> M or less, about <sup>10-8</sup> M or less, about 1\u00d7 <sup>10-9</sup> M or less, about 1\u00d7 <sup>10-10</sup> M or less, KD of 1\u00d7 <sup>10-11</sup> M or lower or 1\u00d7 <sup>10-12</sup> M or lower. KD is calculated as follows: KD=Kd/Ka, where Kd represents the dissociation rate and Ka represents the association rate. Equilibrium dissociation constant KD can be measured using methods well known in the art, such as surface plasmon resonance (eg Biacore) or equilibrium dialysis method, for example, see the method for obtaining KD value shown in Example 5 herein.</p>The term \"antigen-binding molecule\" is used herein in the broadest sense to refer to a molecule that specifically binds an antigen. Illustratively, antigen binding molecules include, but are not limited to, antibodies or antibody mimetics. \"Antibody mimetic\" refers to an organic compound or binding domain that can specifically bind to an antigen, but is unrelated to the structure of an antibody. Exemplarily, antibody mimetics include, but are not limited to, affibody, affitin, affilin, designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPin), nucleic acid aptamer or Kunitz-type domain peptide.</p>The term \"antibody\" is used herein in the broadest sense to refer to a polypeptide comprising sufficient sequence from the variable region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain and/or sufficient sequence from the variable region of an immunoglobulin light chain to enable specific binding to an antigen or peptide combination. \"Antibody\" herein encompasses various forms and various structures so long as they exhibit the desired antigen-binding activity. \"Antibody\" herein includes alternative protein scaffolds or artificial scaffolds with grafted complementarity determining regions (CDRs) or CDR derivatives. Such scaffolds include antibody-derived scaffolds comprising mutations introduced, eg, to stabilize the three-dimensional structure of the antibody, and fully synthetic scaffolds comprising, eg, biocompatible polymers.
