    ", the preculture was diluted with 50mLLB-a at a ratio of 1:100 and incubated to an OD600 of 0.5 to 1.0. Subsequently, the bacterial culture was treated with 0.5mMIPTG (Solarbio) and incubated at 30\u2103for 4 hours to induce recombinant nanobody production. After centrifugation, the bacterial culture was resuspended in lysis buffer and then sonicated on ice. The clarified bacterial lysate was collected by centrifugation at 12,000Xg for 20 minutes. To obtain purified nanobodies, bacterial lysates were loaded onto NiSepharose 6. 6FastFlow (GEHealthcare) and then subjected to gradient elution using pre-chilled elution buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100-300mM imidazole (Solarbio). The eluted nanobodies were concentrated using a centrifugal filtration device (Pall) with a molecular weight cut-off of 3kDa and their buffer was changed to 1 x PBS. The final concentration of all nanobodies was determined by BCA method and their purity was determined on 12% sds-PAGE gel.</p>6. ELISA test</p>To 96-well microplates, 50 nanograms/well WTRBD, ba.1rbd, bq.1.1 s-trimer or xbb.1 s-trimer protein was added and incubated overnight at 4 \u2103. After three PBST washes, the plates were blocked by adding 300. Mu.L/well of blocking solution. Nanobody and ACE2 were diluted 5-fold in 0.5% bsa/PBST gradient and added to a microplate and incubated at 37 \u2103 for one hour. The above experiment was then performed using HRP-conjugated anti-His antibody (1:5000, proteintech), TMB substrate, stop solution and plate reader. EC50 values were calculated in duplicate with the average of OD450 readings.</p>SPR affinity measurement</p>SPR measurements were performed using BiacoreT200,200 instrument (CYTIVALIFESCIENCES) at 25 \u2103. SARS-CoV-2WTRBD and BA.1RBD were immobilized on a CM5SeriesS sensor chip (CYTIVALIFESCIENCES) and approximately 300 Response Units (RU) after dilution in sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5). Five-fold serial dilutions of purified nanobodies were used as mobile phase, flowed through the sensor chip at a flow rate of 30 \u03bcl/min for 180 seconds, and then subjected to dissociation flow for 300 seconds. After each cycle, 10mM glycine (pH 1.5) was injected for 90 seconds to regenerate the sensor chip. Binding data was determined by subtracting background signals from the blank cycles and the reference flow cell. Binding and dissociation curves of the nano antibodies with different concentrations and RBDs are drawn according to the 1:1 binding model fitting data.</p>8. Competitive phage ELISA assay for epitope grouping</p>WTRBD protein (50 nanograms per well) was coated on 96-well microwell plates overnight at 4 \u2103. Subsequently, 300. Mu.L/well of a plugging liquid was added to the microplate for plugging. After three PBST washes, phage-displayed nanobody supernatant (1:10 dilution) and purified nanobody (10. Mu.g/mL) 1:1 mixed samples were added to wells at 100. Mu.L per well. In addition, non-competitive binding was also set in wells without purified nanobodies. After one hour incubation ",
    "op solution and plate reader.</p>10. Pseudovirus neutralization assay</p>To generate SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, HEK293T cells were seeded into 6-well plates the day prior to transfection. The next day, cells were co-transfected with three plasmids, including plasmids encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (WT, BA.1, BA.4/5, BQ.1.1, XBB.1 or single mutant), psPAX2 and pLenti-GFP. After 6 hours of transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM containing 10% fbs. After 48 hours of transfection, the supernatant containing the pseudovirus was collected and the cell residue was removed by filtration using a 0.45 \u03bcm syringe filter (merck).</p>In the pseudovirus neutralization assay, nanobody was diluted three times and added to 96-well white opaque plates (Beyotime), 50 \u03bcl per well. Then, 50. Mu.L of pseudovirus solution was added to each well and mixed with nanobodies, followed by incubation at 37\u2103for one hour. The virus control wells contained only pseudovirus solution. Then, 2X 104HEK293-hACE cells were seeded onto a white opaque plate and incubated at 37\u2103under 5% CO2 for 48 hours. After allowing the white opaque plate to equilibrate at ambient temperature for 10 minutes, 100 \u03bcl of firefly luciferase assay reagent was added to each well. After 5 minutes incubation, chemiluminescent detection was performed using SpectraMaxi x plate reader to quantify the intracellular fluorescent signal of each well. The percent neutralization was calculated by comparison to a virus control. IC50 values were then determined using 4-parameter logistic regression. Experiments were repeated twice or more in triplicate.</p>11. Stability analysis</p>To assess the stability of multivalent nanobodies in vitro, they were stored at 4 \u2103, room Temperature (RT) and 37 \u2103 for 2 weeks or 4 weeks, respectively. Subsequently, their binding affinity to the olmesan xbb.1 s-trimer protein was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.</p>To determine the thermostability, multivalent nanobodies were incubated in water baths at 25, 37, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 \u2103 for half an hour and then equilibrated to room temperature. All the treated multivalent nanobodies were diluted to a concentration of 8 ng/ml and their binding affinity to the trimeric protein of armonk xbb.1s was then determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The ratio of the OD450 value after heat treatment to the OD450 value before treatment was calculated, and then the result was multiplied by 100% to obtain the relative binding activity.</p>12. Statistical analysis</p>All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPadPrism software (version 8.0). Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD of at least two replicates. A 4-parameter logistic regression analysis was used to determine EC50 and IC50 values.</p>Experimental results</p>Construction and screening of VHH phage display libraries</p>To rapidly identify RBD-specific nanobodies with high affinity and appropriate diversity, we attempted to construct a highly diverse VHH phage display library, see fig. 1. Initially, we used SARS-CoV-2S1 and RBD proteins to immunize four alpacas six rounds. A total of 5. Mu.g of intact RNA was extracted from 2X 107PBMCs of immunized alpaca as a template for cDNA synthesis). The VHH gene was then amplified using nested PCR. In the first round of PCR, gene fragments of 1000bp (VH-CH 1-CH 2) and 750bp (VHH-CH 2) were amplified using cDNA as a template, respectively. The 750bp gene fragment was then used as a template for the next round of PCR amplification, thereby generating a VHH gene fragment of about 400bp in length. The VHH gene was then cloned into pHEN.sup.1 vector and TG1 cells were transformed to give a VHH library of about 1.3X107 cfu.</p>Randomly selected 24 clones were verified by colony PCR and showed 100% insertion of VHH library. All 24 clones were then sequenced. A total of 23 clones contained the correct VHH gene framework regions and had different Complementarity Determining Region (CDR) compositions, indicating that we created libraries with 96% in-frame insertion and 100% VHH gene diversity. Taken together, the above results indicate that we constructed VHH libraries with higher quality and satisfactory diversity. Then, the VHH library was revived with M13KO7 ",
    "ng RBD proteins as baits. We calculated the enrichment factors for each round of biological screening, and the results indicated that RBD-bound phage was effectively enriched, see table 2 below.</p>TABLE 2 panning of anti-SARS-CoV-2 nanobody phage display library</p></p>Subsequently, 106 VHH clones were randomly selected from the third round of biological screening and evaluated for binding to WTRBD using phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Notably, 101 out of 106 VHH clones were identified as positive, with a binding rate higher than 3, and were sent for sequencing. Sequence analysis showed that 26 different VHHs were obtained based on the amino acid sequence classification of the CDRs, see fig. 2. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed sequence diversity of these VHHs. Nine nanobodies (designated a14, a31, B13, B18, B20, B27, C2, C8 and D11, respectively) were selected as candidates for further expression and purification based on the results of sequencing and phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. SDS-PAGE analysis shows that the nine nano-antibodies have high separation purity, the molecular weight is about 15kDa, and the molecular weight is consistent with the theoretical value.</p>2. Characterization and epitope grouping of nanobody candidates</p>We first studied the binding capacity of nine candidate nanobodies to WTRBD and ba.1rbd using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Referring to Table 3, the results show that all nanobodies bind strongly to WTRBD and that the EC50 values vary from 0.26 to 23.8 ng/mL. Most nanobodies (except B27) showed a stronger positive signal compared to ACE2, with EC50 values below 0.9 nanograms per milliliter. Remarkably, we found that most nanobodies (except B27) still had strong binding to ba.1rbd, with EC50 values below 107ng/mL. However, all nanobodies, except C8, have a lower binding activity to ba.1rbd than WTRBD. SPR experiments were also performed to calculate kinetic rate constants and affinity constants, and the results showed that all nanobodies (except B27) bound to WTRBD with high affinity. The binding affinity (KD) is between 0.013 and 0.775 nM. Consistent with the results of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, most nanobodies (7 out of 8) have relatively weak binding affinity to armuronate ba.1rbd, but their KD values (except B27) are still in the single digit nanomolar or lower range. Notably, a14 and B20 have strong binding affinities to the armin ba.1rbd with KD values of 0.065nM and 0.026nM, respectively (table 3). Unfortunately, the binding affinity of C8 could not be successfully measured by SPR, possibly due to inapplicability of CM5 chips.</p>TABLE 3 affinity constants of eight nanobodies binding to WT-RBD and BA.1RBD proteins</p></p>To explore whether these nine nanobodies bound to different epitopes, their ability to compete for binding to RBD was assessed using phage competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Purified nanobodies with high concentrations (up to 5 \u03bcg/mL) compete with phage-displayed nanobodies for binding WTRBD. Table 4 summarizes the competition situation with a residual binding rate of less than 20% for a pair of competing nanobodies, indicating that both nanobodies may be directed against the same or similar epitope. In contrast, if the residual binding rate of the competing pair is greater than 90%, it is indicated that the RBD epitopes recognized by the two nanobodies do not overlap. We found that these nine nanobodies are highly diverse, they can be divided into five competing groups, suggesting that they recognize five non-overlapping epitopes on RBD (table 4).</p>Table 4. Epitope grouping of nine nanobodies (nanobody on left column, phage nanobody on top)</p></p>Subsequently, the blocking activity of these nanobodies on RBD-ACE2 was assessed by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. As shown in fig. 3, a14 and D11 were effective in blocking ACE2 binding to RBD at an excess concentration o",
    "thout any blocking effect at a concentration of 0.5. Mu.g/mL. These results indicate that epitopes of a14 and D11 may overlap with RBM (also referred to as ACE2 binding site), while epitopes bound by the remaining nanobodies (a 31, B13, B18, B20, B27, C2 and C8) may be distant from RBM. These experiments show that these 9 nanobodies target 5 non-overlapping epitopes on RBD, and exhibit satisfactory cross-binding activity to WTRBD and ba.1rbd, thus laying a solid foundation for the development of cross-reactive neuroclustered antibodies.</p>3. Cross-neutralizing ability of nanobodies against multiple SARS-CoV-2 omimetic Rong Ya variants</p>In the identification of these nanobodies, the oimilc Rong Ya variants ba.4/5, bq.1.1 and xbb.1 were successively dominant variants in many regions of the world and were found to evade most of the existing neutralizing antibody responses. To evaluate the cross-neutralizing ability of nanobodies to these olmicin Rong Ya variants, we performed a lentivirus-based pseudoviral infection assay. Initially, we successfully packaged five pseudoviruses carrying SARS-CoV-2WT, ba.1, ba.4/5, bq.1.1 or xbb.1 spike glycoprotein. The neutralizing efficacy of nine nanobodies against the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus was quantified at a fixed concentration (5 \u03bcg/mL), see FIG. 4. Nanobodies with neutralization efficiency below 50% are defined as non-neutralizing nanobodies. Then, nanobodies with neutralization efficiency higher than 50% were diluted three times, and IC50 values for each pseudovirus are shown in table 5.</p>TABLE 5 summary of neutralization Activity (IC 50) of nine nanobodies against 5 SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses</p></p>Encouraging that A14 in group C showed cross-protective activity against all pseudoviruses, IC50 values varied from 83.93 to 316.6 ng/ml, suggesting its potential for targeting conserved RBD epitopes, see Table 5. The three nanobodies of group a (a 31, B13 and B18) showed potent neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2WT, omnikow ba.1 and ba.4/5, with IC50 values between 117.6 and 1026 ng/ml, while group B, C2, showed limited neutralizing capacity (IC 50&gt;2 \u03bcg/ml). In addition, D11 is capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2WT and Omikovia BA.1, while B27 can only neutralize WT pseudoviruses. Notably, B20 and C8 have strong binding forces with WTRBD and ba.1rbd; however, even at high concentrations of 5 \u03bcg/ml, they failed to neutralize any pseudoviruses tested. This suggests that they are specific to non-neutralizing epitopes on RBD.</p>We have obtained a total of five nanobodies (a 14, a31, B13, B18 and C2) that specifically target three non-overlapping epitopes on RBD (A, B and C), effectively neutralizing the omnirange ba.1 and ba.4/5 pseudoviruses. Wherein A14 maintains neutralizing activity against the armuronate BQ.1.1 and XBB.1. However, they all lack the potency required for therapeutic applications and need to be further optimized by a multimerization strategy to enhance their potency and broad spectrum neutralization. B18 of the generic competitive group showed a relatively weak neutralizing efficacy compared to a31 and B13, and thus was not considered for further study. Finally, a14, a31, B13 and C2 are selected as modular units for further multivalent engineering.</p>4. Production of diverse multivalent nanobodies with enhanced neutralizing potency and breadth</p>To assess the potential of multivalent in enhancing the neutralizing potency and breadth of a14, a31, B13 and C2 monomers, we designed nine multivalent nanobodies, including homo-or heterodimer nanobodies and homo-or heterotrimeric nanobodies, see fig. 5. These multivalent nanobodies were prepared by joining two or three nanobody monomers through an optimized flexible GlySer linker of 20 amino acids [ (G4S) 4 ]. We found that they can be easily expressed in BL21 cells with purification yields of about 20-50 micrograms per milliliter in shake flask culture. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that dimer (. Apprxeq.30 kDa) and trimer (. Apprxeq.45 kDa) nanobodies were of high purity and had the expected molecular weight.</p>Next, we assessed the neutralizing efficacy of the generated multivalent nanobodies against SARS-CoV-2WT, omnikom ba.1, ba.4/5, bq.1.1 and xbb.1 pseudoviruses and given the corresponding IC50 values, see table 6, summary of neutralization activity (IC 50) of nine multivalent nanobodies of table 6 against 5 SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses and fold improvement over monovalent nanobodies.</p>TABLE 6 summary of neutralization Activity (IC 50) of nine multivalent nanobodies against 5 SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses</p></p>Surprisingly, these multivalent nanobodies were able to neutralize all pseudoviruses tested, except a31-a 31. The neutralizing activity of the B13-B13-B13 homotrimer was the strongest, with a GMIC50 value of 20.83 ng/ml (Table 6). Its neutralization capacity is significantly enhanced compared to the B13 monomer, 86.1 to 268 times higher neutralization capacity for all pseudoviruses tested. The homodimers of A31-A31 and B13-B13 and the heterodimers of A31-C2 and B13-C2 have potent neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2WT, HMW BA.1 and BA.4/5, and IC50 values below 24 nanograms/milliliter. Also, their neutralization capacity is significantly improved by about 15.4-113 times compared to the corresponding monomers A31 and B13. Notably, the heterodimers A31-C2 and B13-C2 exhibit higher potency against the armstrong BQ.1.1 and XBB.1 than the homodimers A31-A31 and B13-B13. Although the four multivalent nanobodies comprising a14 modular units (a 14-a31, a14-B13, a14-C2 and a14-a 31-C2) showed extensive neutralization for all five pseudoviruses tested, their enhanced neutralization efficacy was weak or insignificant compared to monomer a 14. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the multimerization strategy can improve the neutralizing capacity and breadth of monomeric nanobodies.</p>5. Mechanism analysis of multivalent nanobodies to improve neutralization breadth</p>To further explore the mechanism by which multivalent nanobodies increase the breadth of neutralization, we selected B13-B13, B13-C2, and B13-B13 as representative antibodies for subsequent studies. Referring to fig. 6, first, we studied whether the binding affinity of these three multivalent nanobodies to the olmesan bq.1.1 (fig. 6A) and xbb.1s trimer (fig. 6B) is higher than that of its monomer. As expected, the binding affinities of B13-C2, B13-B13 and B13-B13-B13 to the HMW BQ.1.1S trimeric protein were increased by 643-fold, 482-fold and 965-fold, respectively, compared to B13. Likewise, they bind to the trimers protein of the olmesan xbb.1s also 157-, 94-and 471-fold more tightly than B13. The binding activity of B13-C2 to the BQ.1.1 and XBB.1S trimeric proteins was also increased by 12.2-fold and 15.7-fold, respectively, compared to C2. These results indicate that the combined structure of our multivalent nanobodies can significantly enhance the binding affinity of monomeric nanobodies to the olmesan S-trimer, thereby increasing their neutralizing capacity.</p>Compared to BA.4/5, the RBD proteins of BQ.1.1 and XBB.1 contain an additional 7 mutations. To verify the effect of these additional mutations, we constructed seven mutant pseudoviruses on the basis of BA.4/5 to determine the key residues that developed resistance to B13 and C2. Compared with BA.4/5, the neutralizing capacity of B13 to R346T mutant pseudovirus is obviously reduced, and the IC50 value is reduced by more than 10.8 times. In addition, the neutralizing activity of monomer C2 against the N460K mutant pseudovirus was also reduced with an IC50&gt; 5. Mu.g/mL (fold change could not be calculated). The simultaneous presence of the R346T and N460K mutations in bq.1.1 and xbb.1 is why these two subvariants are resistant to B13 and C2 neutralization. In sharp contrast, however, B13-C2, B13-B13, and B13-B13 multivalent nanobodies exhibited significant neutralization breadth and greater efficacy (table 7). They were effective in neutralizing all seven single mutants with IC50 values below 100 nanograms/milliliter. Thus, R346T and N460K mutations can cause the virus to evade monomeric nanobodies, but not multivalent nanobodies. Notably, the neutralizing activity of these three multivalent nanobodies was slightly reduced (3.1-4.4 fold) for the R346T and/or N460K mutant pseudoviruses (Table 7), table 7 is the IC50 values for B13, C2, B13-B13 and B13-B13-B13 for seven single mutants and the respective fold reductions in IC50 relative to BA.4/5 were calculated.</p>Table 7 shows the IC50 values of B13, C2, B13-B13 and B13-B13-B13 for seven single mutants</p></p>These findings illustrate why the neutralizing activity of these multivalent nanobodies on bq.1.1 and xbb.1 is lower than ba.4/5. In short, our multivalent nanobodies (B13-C2, B13-B13 and B13-B13) have a stronger neutralizing potency, and can accommodate the R346T and N460K escape mutations present on the armin bq.1.1 and xbb.1 subvariants, resulting in a good neutralization breadth.</p>6. Excellent stability of multivalent nanobodies</p>Of the divalent and trivalent nanobodies, B13-C2 and B13-B13-B13, respectively, showed the highest neutralizing activity. Therefore, we selected them as representative antibodies for further stability analysis. We assessed the in vitro stability of B13-C2 and B13-B13-B13, which were stored at three different temperatures (4 \u2103, RT and 37 \u2103) for 2 or 4 weeks. Subsequently, their binding capacity to S-trimer was determined by ELISA. As shown in Table 8, the binding capacities of B13-C2 and B13-B13-B13 remained almost unchanged after 2 weeks of storage at three different temperatures. After 4 weeks at RT or 37\u2103their binding activity is slightly reduced but remains in the single digit nanograms per milliliter range. Furthermore, as shown in FIG. 7, B13-C2 and B13-B13-B13 exhibit excellent thermal stability (FIGS. 7A and 7B, respectively). After incubation at 70\u2103for 30 minutes, the relative binding activity of B13-C2 and B13-B13-B13 remained above 90%. However, after in",
    "ralization mechanism of these non-RBM-targeted nanobodies remains to be further investigated, possibly by disrupting the stability of SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer or blocking the formation of potential syncytia. In a word, we obtained three groups of RBD targeted neutralizing nanobodies with different epitopes and different neutralizing mechanisms, which laid a solid foundation for developing potent and broad-spectrum multivalent nanobodies.</p>Given the natural trimeric manifestation of spike proteins on the surface of SARS-CoV-2, multimeric nanobodies are likely to target multiple RBD antigens simultaneously, thereby greatly improving efficacy. Multimeric designs include mainly homodimers, heterodimers, homotrimers and heterotrimers. Therefore, we focused on the four designs described above, selecting four neutralizing nanobodies, namely a31 and B13 of group a, C2 of group B and a14 of group C, constructed twelve different multivalent nanobodies. However, since the protein expression amounts of three multivalent nanobodies (A14-A14, A14-A14-A14 and A31-A31-A31) were low, we could only obtain nine purified multivalent nanobodies. Without being expected, most multivalent nanobodies have significantly improved resistance to the oimi gram Rong Ya variant compared to the monomer. Notably, the two homodimers (A31-A31, B13-B13), the two heterodimers (A31-C2, B13-C2) and one homotrimer (B13-B13) exhibited high neutralizing efficacy against SARS-CoV-2WT and HMG-Row BA.1 and BA.4/5, with IC50 values below 24 nanograms/milliliter. In addition to A31-A31, they are effective in neutralizing the Omikovia BQ.1.1 and XBB.1, which is not possible with the corresponding monomers (A31, B13 and C2). Furthermore, we found that heterodimers A31-C2 and B13-C2 were more effective on BQ.1.1 and XBB.1 than homodimers A31-A31 and B13-B13. These results indicate that fusion of nanobodies against different epitopes into heterodimeric forms is an effective strategy to overcome escape mutants, consistent with previous findings. We also observed that the in vitro neutralization potency of nanobodies against pseudoviruses increases progressively with increasing potency. Taking B13 as an example, from B13 to B13-B13-B13, the neutralization of SARS-CoV-2WT, armonk, BA.1, BA.4/5, BQ.1.1 and XBB.1 pseudoviruses is increased 109-fold, 120-fold, 268-fold, &gt; 146-fold and &gt; 86.1-fold, respectively. The neutralization potency of the other four multivalent nanobodies (A14-A31, A14-B13, A14-C2 and A14-A31-C2) was amplified less than the corresponding A14 monomers, possibly due to steric constraints of the linker. Notably, in this study, the most potent multivalent nanobody B13-B13-B13 is superior to the previously reported broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies, such as S728-1157 and VacBB-551. Our research shows that reasonable design of multivalent nanobodies is a rapid method for producing potent virus neutralizers, which can enhance the efficacy of controlling virus escape mutants.<"
