    "tably transformed with recombinant DNA molecules expressing a library of compounds. Such cells, either in viable or fixed form, can be used for standard binding-partner assays. See also Parce et al. (1989) Science 246:243-247; and Owicki et al. (1990) Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 87;4007-4011 , which describe sensitive methods to detect cellular responses. Competitive assays are particularly useful, where the cells expressing the library of compounds are contacted or incubated with a labelled antibody known to bind to a GPR146</p>\n  , polypeptide of the present invention, such as <sup>125</sup>I-antibody, and a test sample such as a candidate compound whose binding affinity to the binding composition is being measured. The bound and free labelled binding partners for the polypeptide are then separated to assess the degree of binding. The amount of test sample bound is inversely proportional to the amount of labelled antibody binding to the polypeptide.</p>\n  Any one of numerous techniques can be used to separate bound from free binding partners to assess the degree of binding. This separation step could typically involve a procedure such as adhesion to filters followed by washing, adhesion to plastic following by washing, or centrifugation of the cell membranes.</p>\n  Still another approach is to use solubilized, unpurified or solubilized purified polypeptide or peptides, for example extracted from transformed eukaryotic or prokaryotic host cells. This allows for a \"molecular\" binding assay with the advantages of increased specificity, the ability to automate, and high drug test throughput. In a preferred embodiment, the GPR146 polypeptide is contacted with a candidate agent to determine whether the candidate agent affects the activity of the GPR146.</p>\n  Another technique for candidate compound screening involves an approach which provides high throughput screening for new compounds having suitable binding affinity, e.g., to a polypeptide of the invention, and is described in detail in \n\nWO84/03564. First, large numbers of different small peptide test compounds are synthesized on a solid substrate, e.g., plastic pins or some other appropriate surface; see Fodor et al. (1991). Then all the pins are reacted with solubilized polypeptide of the invention and washed. The next step involves detecting bound polypeptide. Compounds which interact specifically with the polypeptide will thus be identified.</p>\n  Ligand-binding assays provide a direct method for ascertaining receptor pharmacology and are adaptable to a high throughput format. The purified ligand for a receptor may be radiolabeled to high specific activity (50-2000 Ci/mmol) for binding studies. A determination is then made that the process of radiolabeling does not diminish the activity of the ligand towards its receptor. Assay conditions for buffers, ions, pH and other modulators such as nucleotides are optimized to establish a workable signal to noise ratio for both membrane and whole cell "
