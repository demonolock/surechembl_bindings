BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </p> Figure 1. Inhibitors inhibit activity of MERS-CoV PLpro and CCHFV OTU in vitro. (A) Sequences of inhibitors that bind MERS-CoV or CCHFV vDUBs. Only regions subjected to diversification relative to Ub.wt in the phage-displayed library are shown. Amino acids discussed in the text are highlighted. (B) The binding specificities of phage-displayed inhibitors (y-axis) are shown across a group of 12 DUBs (x-axis), as assessed by phage ELISA. Sub-saturating concentrations of phage were added to immobilized proteins as indicated. Bound phages were detected by the addition of anti-M13-HRP and colorimetric development of TMB peroxidase substrate. The mean value of absorbance at 450 nm is shaded in a black-red-yellow gradient. (C) Inhibition of MERS-CoV PLpro (solid lines) or CCHFV OTU (dashed lines) by the cognate inhibitors shown as dose-response curves using Ub-AMC (left) or ISG15-AMC (right) as a substrate. The IC50 value was determined as the concentration of inhibitor that reduced proteolytic activity by 50% (Table 2). The wt Ub data obtained in the delSGylation assay cannot be fitted by GraphPad Prism so no lines are shown. (D) Effects of inhibitors on vDUB activity against K48/K63 tetra-Ub substrates. Purified MERS-CoV PLpro (top panels) or CCHFV OTU (bottom panels) was incubated with the indicated inhibitors or Ub.wt (negative control) and biotinylated tetra-Ub at 37\u00b0C for a time course of 30 minutes. Western blots were probed with ExtrAvidin-HRP (EA- HRP) to detect biotin-Ub. Inhibition of proteolysis was shown by a delay of </p>appearance of the digestion products tri-Ub (Ub3), di-Ub (Ub2) and mono-Ub (Ubl). Figure 2. Structural basis for inhibition of MERS-CoV PLpro.

    "c cleavage capability of MERS-CoV PLpro was assessed in the presence of the inhibitors. N- terminally HA-tagged and C-terminally V5-tagged nsp3C-4 (excluding the PLpro domain) was co-expressed with V5-tagged MERS-CoV PLpro-V5 (wild type or the active site mutant C), FLAG-ME-inhibitor (with increasing doses) and GFP (as a transfection control). Cells were lysed 18 hours post transfection and proteolytic cleavage activity was assessed by western blotting to detect generation of N-terminal HA-tagged nsp3C and C-terminal V5-tagged nsp4 cleavage products. (D) MERS-CoV titers of collected supernatants from lentivirus transduced and, subsequently, MERS- CoV infected MRC5 cells. MRC-5 cells were transduced with lentiviruses encoding FLAG-inhibitors, FLAG-Ub.AA or GFP (latter two as controls) and, either 32 hours or 48 hours post-transduction, the cells were infected with MERS-CoV at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01. After another 32 hours, culture supernatants were harvested and MERS-CoV titers were determined by plaque assays on Vero cells. Significant difference relative to MERS-CoV titers from lentivirus transduced MRC5 cells expressing Ub.AA is indicated: * p &lt; 0.05. Bars represent mean and error bars represent S.D. </p> Figure 5.

Overview of sequences of MERS-CoV-specific inhibitors. Changes compared to inhibitors of Figure 1A are highlighted and critical amino acid residues that are important for the strong binding to MERS-CoV PLpro are indicated at positions 46, 64, and 74. ME.1.1 and ME.3.1 were generated to determine the role of V70I on binding affinity. Region 1 of variant ME.4 was changed to region 1 of Ub WT (ME.4.2) or region 1 of ME. l (ME.4.4) to determine if stability could be increased. Figure 20. Variants ME. l and ME.3 are more thermostable than ME.2 and ME.4. DSC curves are shown for (A) Ub, (B) ME.2, (C) ME.3, (D) ME.4 and (E) Ub. Tm values are indicated. </p> Figure 21. Mutation RIOG stabilizes ME.4. Fluorescence melt curves are shown for (A) ME.2, (B) ME.4 and (C) ME.4R10G. Assays were performed in triplicate, and representative curves for each variant are reported, with the Tm and standard deviations indicated. </p> Figure 22. The expression levels of the inhibitors were determined by transfecting HEK293T cells with plasmids encoding FLAG-ME- Inh as indicated. Cells were lysed 18 hours post transfection and expressed proteins were analyzed on a Western blot.</p>Protein levels of ME.2, ME.4 and ME.4.1 were lower compared to ME. l, ME.1.1, ME.3 and ME.3.1. Changing region 1 of ME.4 either to region 1 of Ub WT or region 1 of ME. l results in higher protein levels (ME.4.2, ME.4.3 and ME4.4). </p>Figure 23. A. Relative FLAG-Inh protein levels were determined by quantification of Western blots. Protein bands were quantified of least three independent experiments and error bars indicate the standard error of the mean. ME.2, ME.4, ME.4.1 and ME.4.5 have the lowest relative protein levels whereas ME. l, ME.1.1, ME.3, ME.3.1 \n\n as well as stabilized variants of ME.4 (ME.4.2, ME.4.3 and ME4.4) are higher expressed. </p> B. Relative mRNA levels of inhibitors were determined by RT-qPCR. mRNA levels of the inhibitors were normalized to the transfection efficiency (neomycin) and to the normalization gene (actin). Error bars show the standard deviation. Although the protein levels of ME. l, ME.3, ME.4.2, ME.4.3 and ME4.4 are higher when compared to ME.2, ME.4, ME.4.1 their relative mRNA levels are lower. </p>Figure 24. Binding assays </p> A. ME.4, ME.4.2 and ME4.4 bind equally strong to MERS-CoV PLpro in the binding assay. Mutating amino acid residues that are important for the binding to MERS-CoV PLpro to Ub WT residues severely reduced the binding affinity (ME.4.5, ME.4.2.1 and ME.4.4.1). Also Q48 and V62 in ME.4.2 contribute to the high binding affinity of this variant because these residues were mutated to Ub WT residues in ME.4.3 and this resulted in a lower affinity of this variant compared to ME.4.2. </p> B. Mutating critical amino acid residues that are important for the strong binding to MERS-CoV PLpro to Ub WT residues reduced the binding affinity. </p> Figure 25.

Bindings assay with CCHFV inhibitors. \n\n</p>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSED EMBODIMENTS </p>Many viruses, including MERS-CoV and the Crime an- Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) encode deubiquitinating (DUB) enzymes that are critical for viral replication and pathogenicity. They bind and remove ubiquitin (Ub) and the Ub-like protein interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) from cellular proteins to suppress host antiviral innate immune responses. A variety of viral DUBs (vDUBs), including the MERS-CoV papain-like protease, are responsible for cleaving the viral replicase polyproteins during replication, and are thereby critical components of the viral replication cycle. </p>Together, this makes vDUBs highly attractive antiviral drug targets. However, structural similarity between the catalytic cores of vDUBs and human DUBs com",
    "nd CCHFV vDUBs </p>A polypeptide library [25] was screened against the MERS-CoV PLpro domain (MERS-CoV PLpro) and the CCHFV OTU domain (CCHFV OTU). Inhibitors were \n\n identified that bound with high affinity to either MERS-CoV PLpro (ME. l to ME.4) or CCHFV OTU (CC. l to CC.5) (Fig. 1A). To confirm the specificity of the inhibitors towards their cognate vDUBs, the phage-displayed inhibitors were challenged against a diverse panel of 11 DUBs from several species representing distinct DUB families (USP, OTU, and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCH)). Indeed, all inhibitors bound only to their cognate viral proteins but not to the 11 additional DUBs tested (Fig. IB). To determine the binding affinities of each identified inhibitor, phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (Fig. 5) and Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI) measurements were performed (Table 4). Each inhibitor was found to bind its cognate vDUB with affinities in the low to sub -nanomolar range, whereas wild-type Ub (Ub.wt) showed binding to MERS-CoV or CCHFV vDUBs only in the high micromolar range (Fig. 5B and Table 2). Consistent with the high affinities observed for the inhibitors toward their respective vDUBs, each inhibitor also potently inhibited the deubiquitinating and delSGylating activities of MERS-CoV PLpro or CCHFV OTU as measured using the fluorogenic substrates Ub-AMC or ISG15-AMC, respectively (Fig. 1C and Fig. 6). The most potent inhibitors of MERS-CoV PLpro and CCHFV OTU were ME.4 </p>(deubiquitination IC50 = 0.8 nM and delSGlyation IC50 = 1.2 nM) and CC.4 </p>(deubiquitination IC50 = 3.3 nM and delSGlyation IC50 = 11 nM), respectively (Table 2). Furthermore, the inhibitors were confirmed to inhibit processing of K48- and K63- linked tetra-Ub substrates by their respective vDUBs (Fig. ID). </p>Example 2. Structural basis for vDUB inhibition </p> To reveal the molecular basis for the inhibition of MERS-CoV PLpro by inhibitors, crystal structures of the enzyme were determined bound to ME.2 or ME.4 (Fig. 2A,B and Table 1). Both inhibitors bound in nearly identical orientations as Ub.wt (Fig. 2C and Fig. 7A) with interface surface areas of -1000 A2 [9, 27]. Substitutions common to both ME.4 and ME.2 at positions 46, 64 and 70 (Fig. 1A) were found to promote more favorable hydrophobic interactions with the enzyme relative to Ub.wt. Inhibitor residue He 70 extends further into a hydrophobic pocket of PLpro formed by residues Thrl730* and Vall691* (asterisks denote amino acid numbering of MERS-CoV polyprotein), in comparison to Ub.wt residue Val70 (Fig. 2D). ME.2 and ME.4 residue Phe46 inserts into a hydrophobic pocket formed by PLpro residues Trpl668*, </p>Glul670*, Vall680*, Leul682*, Tyrl690* and Tyrl705*. and forms a cation-\u03c0 \n\n interaction with Argl715* (Fig. 2E). These extensive interactions are not formed at the PLpro-Ub.wt interface with the homologous residue Ala46. In addition, ME.2 and ME.4 residue Tyr64 undergoes more extensive hydrophobic interaction with Vall706* and Glyl71()*, compared to Ub.wt residue Glu64 (Fig. 2F). The inhibitors also differ in their C-terminal residu",
    "opped below 10 PFU/ml upon expression of ME.4, which represented a reduction in infectious progeny titers of more than four orders of magnitude (Fig. 4D) and correlated with higher expression of the inhibitors at this time point (Fig. 13 and 14). In HuH-7 cells the expression of GFP or Ub.AA did not affect MERS-CoV titers compared to the non- transduced cells, whereas ME. l expression led to a two orders of magnitude reduction in virus titer, and an even \n\n greater reduction of more than three orders of magnitude was observed upon ME.4 expression (Fig. 15). The effect of inhibitors on MERS-CoV progeny titers was more severe in MRC5 cells compared to HuH-7 cells, which might be due to generally higher expression of inhibitors in MRC5 cells than in HuH-7 cells (Fig. 3D, 13B and 15). Taken together, these studies show that the inhibitors readily inhibit the proteolytic activities of MERS-CoV PLpro in cells and provide extremely effective protection from MERS-CoV infection. </p>Example 5. Modification of ME.4 inhibitor </p>ME.4 was mutated at position 46 from F to A, at position 64 from Y to E, and at position 70 from I to V to generate ME.4.1 (SEQ ID NO: 11). We expressed ME4.1 in MRC5 or HuH-7 cells using the lentivirus -based expression system and infected the transduced cells with MERS-CoV. Compared to ME.4, ME.4.1 was less effective in inhibiting MERS-CoV replication, highlighting the importance of the F46, Y64 and 170 residues in ME.4 for the inhibitory effect (Figure 17). IC50 and EC50 values (Table 3) were also determined as described herein (see Figure 18). </p>Example 6. Modification of CC.4 inhibitor </p> CC.4 was mutated to remove 1 to 4 amino acids of the C-terminus (CC.4.1-CC.4.4) or to mutate position 75 from V to G (CC.4.5). Binding curves of these inhibitors to CCHFV OTU are shown in Figure 26 and EC50 values were determined and are listed in Table 5. The results demonstrate that residues V75, P76 and W77 in the tail region of CC.4 play a role in the high binding affinity to CCHFV OTU. Example 7 Modification of ME. l and ME.3 inhibitors </p> ME.1.1 and ME.3.1 were generated to determine whether the binding affinity of ME. l and ME.3 can be increased by introducing the V70I substitution. As shown in Table 5, this mutation does not increase the binding affinity to MERS-CoV PLpro compared to their original variants, ME. l and ME.3. </p>Example 8. Inhibitors with increased stability </p> Upon expression in E. coli, it was apparent the ME. l and ME.3 were significantly more soluble that ME.2 and ME.4. Further preliminary experiments using differential \n\n scanning calorimetry (DSC) determined that ME. l and ME.3 exhibited higher Tm values (83.7\u00b0C and 83.9\u00b0C respectively) than ME.2 and ME.4 (47.5\u00b0C and 46.6\u00b0C respectively) (Fig. 20). Analysis of the primary sequences of ME.2 and ME.4 showed that a number of mutations which are unique to these inhibitors near the N-terminus appeared to be uninvolved in PLpro binding ( Zhang, W., Bailey-Elkin, B.

The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.8. 2015. Supplemental methods </p> ELISA assays to evaluate binding and specificity </p> Proteins under study were immobilized on 384-well MaxiSorp plates (Thermo </p>Scientific 12665347) by adding 30 \u03bc\u0390^ of 1 \u03bc\u039c proteins for overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C. Phage and protein ELISA against immobilized proteins was performed as previously described [1, 2]. Binding of phage was detected using anti-M13-HRP antibody (GE Healthcare 27942101) and binding of FLAG-tagged inhibitors was detected using anti-FLAG-HRP antibody (Sigma-Aldrich A8592). To measure the half maximal binding concentration (EC50) of inhibitors binding to viral proteases, the concentration of inhibitors or wild type Ub was varied from 0 to 4 \u03bc\u039c (24 points, 1:2 dilution), while the concentration of target proteins immobilized on the plate remained at 1 \u03bc\u039c. EC50 values were calculated using the GraphPad Prism software with the built-in equation formula (non-linear regression curve). </p>Octet Bio- Layer Interferometry (BLI) </p> Experiments were performed as previously described [2]. Concentrated analyte and ligand proteins were diluted into BLI reaction buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.01% tween 20). Experiments of BLI were carried out on Octet RED96 system (ForteBio) using anti-GST antibody biosensors for GST-tagged ligands and His-tagged analytes at 25\u00b0C. 7-9 concentration points of analytes covering a wide titration range were applied for BLI experiments. Sensorgram raw data was processed and extracted by Octet Analysis 9.0. Binding- constants KD were obtained by fitting the response wavelength shifts in the steady- state regions using single -site binding system (Eq. 1) shown below. \n\n where Req is the value of the response shift in the steady-state region in each sensorgram curve, [C] is the titrant concentration, Rmax is the maximal response in the steady-state region, KD is the binding constant for the single-site binding system. In both equations, Rmax and KD values are unknown and the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was used to perform iterative non-linear least squares curve fitting in Profit 6.2 (QuantumSoft) to obtain the fitted Rmax and KD. </p>Deconjugation assays </p> Ub/ISG15-amido-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) </p>Inhibition assays using Ub-AMC or ISG15-AMC (both Boston Biochem) as </p>deconjugation substrates were performed as described before [1, 3] . Experiments were performed in assay buffer (50 niM HE PES, pH 7.5, 0.01% Tween 20, 1 mM </p>dithiothreitol (DTT)) containing 1 \u03bc\u039c Ub-AMC substrate, 10 nM viral DUBs (vDUBs) and 12 serial dilutions of inhibitor. vDUBs and inhibitors were mixed in assay buffer as indicated and incubated at room temperature for 2 min prior to the addition of Ub- AMC. All serial dilutions were performed in 96-well plates and subsequently transferred to 384-well black plates (Thermo Scientific) for making measurements. Deconjugation activity was measured by monitoring the increase of AMC fluorescence emission at 460 nm (excitation at 360 nm) for 30 min using a BioTek Synergy2 plate reader (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT). IC50 values were calculated using the GraphPad Prism software with the built-in equation formula (non-linear regression curve). </p> K48/K63 tetra-Ub </p> Inhibition assays using Biotin Tetra-Ub/Ub4 WT Chains (K48- or K63-linked, Boston Biochem) as deubiquitination substrates were performed in assay buffer (50 mM</p>HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT) containing 1 \u03bc\u039c substrate, 1 \u03bc\u039c vDUB and 10 \u03bc\u039c inhibitor as indicated. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for the indicated times, reactions were stopped by the addition of 10 mM EDTA and SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved using 4-20% gradient gels (Bio-Rad). The cleavage of K48/K63 tetra Ub chains was evaluated by Western blotting, probed with ExtrAvidinlC-Peroxidase (Sigma). </p> Protein expression and purification \n\n ME.2 and ME.4 </p> Plasmids named pET53-ME.2, and -ME.4 were transformed into CaC12-competent Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) Gold cells (Agilent) to allow for T7 polymerase- driven expression of N-terminally His6-tagged ME.2 and ME.4 respectively. Cells were grown at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 150 \u03bcg/mL ampicillin to an optical density (OD600) of 0.6 and then induced at 16\u00b0C by addition of Isopropyl B-D- l-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; final concentration 1 mM). After overnight incubation, cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (500 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0) and lysed via French press. The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 17,211 x g at 4\u00b0C for 30 min, then incubated with 2 niL Ni-NTA Superflow resin (Qiagen) at"
