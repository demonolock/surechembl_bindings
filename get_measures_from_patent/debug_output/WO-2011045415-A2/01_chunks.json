    ">l-radiolabelled</p>IMPY. </p> Fifty microliters of aggregated peptides (20 \u03bc\u039c) are incubated for 3h under gentle agitation at room temperature with 40 pL of each non-radio!abelled test compound dilution and with 50 pL of radtolabelled ligand at 1 nM in 860 pL of ethanol 10% (quadruplicate per condition). For the total binding, 50 pl_ of aggregated peptides (20 pM) is incubated for 3h under gentle agitation at room temperature with 40 pL of ethanol 10% and with 50 pL of radioiabeiled ligand solution at 1 nM in 860 pL of ethano! 10% (quadruplicate per condition). Tubes (quadruplicate) without aggregated peptides are added as control of radioactivity retained on filter. Fifty microliters of peptides buffer solution are mixed with 40 pL ethanol 10% and with 50 pL of the radioiabeiled ligand solution in 860 pL of ethanol 10% (quadruplicate per condition). </p> At the end of incubation time, the mixture is then filtered through GF/B filters by using a Brande! M24 Harvester. Filters are then washed twice with 3 mL of ethanol 10%. Filters are collected and the radioactivity is counted with a gamma-counter Cobra II. </p> A curve is drawn with GraphPad Prism 4.02 software in order to represent the total specific radioligand binding (cpm) as a function of the logarithm concentration of unlabeled compound. This curve allows determining the IC<sub>S0</sub> for each compound. The IC<sub>5</sub>o is the concentration of unlabelied test compound that blocks 50% of the specific binding. The Ki of IMPY (homologous competition) is calculated from the IC<sub>50,</sub> using the following equation: K, = K<sub>D</sub> = IC<sub>50</sub> - L. The Ki of each compound is calculated from the IC5<sub>0</sub>, using the following equation: Ki = IC<sub>50</sub> / [1 + [radioligand]/ K<sub>D</sub>]. 2.5 Compounds testing </p>Positive results and binding values (range of 1 to 5 on a [0-5] scale) indicate promising affinity towards amyloid markers (or other AD associated markers such as Tau aggregates), with values IC50 in the target range 1 to 300 nM, in particular 5 to 100 nM. Values Log P of about 2 to 4 may be obtained. </p>2.6 Comparaison of compounds of formula (I) wherein (B) is (B1) with m - 1 and the PIB compound \n\n The most examined compound PIB having the following formula : \n<img id=\"imgf000049_0001\" path=\"imgf000049_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/169353978/WO/20110421/A2/002011/04/54/15/imgf000049_0001.tif\"/>\n </p>has been tested clinically and, hence demonstrated to be a potential biomarker for the visualization of \u0391\u03b2 plaques in AD brains with PET. However, the first generation of radioligands for PET, including the [<sup>11</sup>C]PIB, are not ideal for quantification due to low signal to noise ratio, high non-specific binding or unfavourable kinetics. The non-specific binding of \u0391\u03b2 PET ligands should also be minimized in order to increase the sensitivity to allow for even lower levels of \u0391\u03b2 plaques to be detected, and thus to monitor \u03b2-amyloid lowing therapies with higher sensitivity. </p>Therefore, a critical need to fine-tune the binding specificity, the kinetics of the uptake and washout of \u0391\u03b2 radioligands derivatives exists. Previous results regarding uptake into and clearance from the brain point to high lipophilicity as one of the reasons for a slow washout from the brain and a high non-specific binding, two crucial properties for achieving an adequate signal to noise ratio. </p> The present inventors replaced the original phenyl group"
