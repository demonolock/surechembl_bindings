    "g cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. Among these myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines, such as those derived from the MOPC-21 and MPC-11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif. and SP2/0, FO or X63-Ag8-653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va.</p>Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor, J Immunol 133:3001 (1984); and Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, Marcel Dekker, Inc, pp. 51-63 (1987)). The mouse myeloma cell line NSO may also be used (European Collection of Cell Cultures, Salisbury, Wilshire, UK).</p>Another alternative is to use electrical fusion rather than chemical fusion to form hybridomas. Instead of fusion, a B cell can be immortalized using, for example, Epstein Barr Virus or another transforming gene, see, e.g., Zurawaki et al., in Monoclonal Antibodies, ed., Kennett et al., Plenum Press, pp. 19-33. (1980). Transgenic mice expressing immunoglobulins and severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice transplanted with human B lymphocytes also can be used.</p>The culture medium in which hybridoma cells are grown is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against CXCR5. The binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells may be determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA), fluorocytometric analysis (FACS) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Such techniques are known in the art and are within the skill of the artisan. The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody to CXCR5 can, for example, be determined by a Scatchard analysis (Munson et al., Anal Biochem 107:220 (1980)).</p>After hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity, affinity, and/or activity, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, Academic Press, pp. 59-103 (1986)). Suitable culture media include, for example, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (D-MEM) or RPMI-1640 medium. In addition, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal.</p>The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated or isolated from the culture medium, ascites fluid or serum by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, protein G-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel exclusion chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis or affinity chromatography.</p>A variety of methods exist in the art for the production of monoclonal antibodies and thus, the invention is not limited to their sole production in hybridomas. For example, the monoclonal antibodies may be made by recombinant DNA methods, such as those descri",
    "ibodies can be less immunogenic than wholly murine mAbs, and the fragments and single chain antibodies also can be less immunogenic.</p>Antibodies or antibody fragments can be isolated from antibody phage libraries generated using the techniques described in McCafferty et al., Nature 348:552 (1990). Clarkson et al., Nature 352:624 (1991) and Marks et al., J Mol Biol 222:581 (1991) describe the isolation of murine and human antibodies, respectively, using phage libraries. Subsequent publications describe the production of high affinity (nM range) human antibodies by chain shuffling (Marks et al., Bio/Technology 10:779 (1992)), as well as combinatorial infection and in vivo recombination as a strategy for constructing very large phage libraries (Waterhouse et al., Nucl Acids Res 21:2265 (1993)). Thus, the techniques are viable alternatives to traditional monoclonal antibody hybridoma techniques for isolation of monoclonal antibodies.</p>Anti-CXCR5 antibodies are tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), FACS, Western immunoblotting or other immunochemical techniques as known in the art. Thus, B cells or cells expressing CXCR5 can be used to detect antibody binding thereto using a known technique, or recombinantly expressed CXCR5 or portion thereof, such as the EC domain, can be adhered to a solid phase and used as a capture element in an assay, configured as a design choice.</p>To determine whether a particular antibody homolog binds to human CXCR5, any conventional binding assay may be used. Useful CXCR5 binding assays include FACS analysis, ELISA assays, radioimmunoassays and the like, which detect binding of antibody, and functions resulting therefrom, to human CXCR5. Full-length and soluble forms of human CXCR5 taught herein are useful in such assays. The binding of an antibody or homolog to CXCR5, or to soluble fragments thereof, may conveniently be detected through the use of a second antibody specific for immunoglobulins of the species from which the antibody or homolog is derived.</p>To determine whether a particular antibody or homolog does or does not significantly block binding of CXCL13 or other ligand to human CXCR5, any suitable competition assay may be used. Useful assays include, for example, ELISA assays, FACS assays, radioimmunoassays and the like that quantify the ability of the antibody or homolog to compete with CXCL13 or other ligand for binding to human CXCR5. Preferably, the ability of ligand to block binding of labeled human CXCR5 to immobilized antibody or homolog is measured.</p>The ability of an antibody or homolog to bind to human CXCR5 can be evaluated by testing the ability thereof to bind to human CXCR5<sup>+</sup> cells. Suitable CXCR5<sup>+</sup> cells for use in determining whether a particular antibody or homolog binds to human CXCR5 are mammal tissue culture cells transformed with DNA encoding full-length human CXCR5 and expressing the CXCR5 on the cell surface or B cell lines.</p>Binding of the antib",
    " and analyzed in a gamma counter. Wells to which 5% FCS/PBS is added instead of culture supernatant served as background wells.</p>The purified CXCR5 is labeled with <sup>125</sup>I according to the Bolton-Hunter method, substantially as described by the supplier of the Bolton-Hunter reagent (New England Nuclear, Boston, Mass.). The quality of the <sup>125</sup>I-CXCR5 is monitored by confirming that the labeling procedure did not destroy the epitopes recognized by commercially available CXCR5 antibodies (R &amp; D or Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, Calif.).</p>Clones are considered to be positive on primary screening if supernatant samples are labeled approximately 10-fold over background in the RIA. Positive clones are pulled, expanded and stored frozen.</p>A primary hybridoma screen was designed to determine whether the antibodies recognized native CXCR5 epitopes. That was accomplished by FACS analysis of cell surface CXCR5 displayed on CXCR5<sup>+</sup> cells stained with the monoclonal antibodies, visualizing binding with fluorescently labeled goat anti-mouse second antibody. Clones were considered to be positive on primary screening if supernatant samples were labeled approximately 10-fold over background in the FACS analysis. Also, to localize the CXCR5 epitopes bound by antibodies, competition assays with CXCR5 antibodies were conducted. Positive clones were selected, expanded and stored frozen.</p>Example 3: Cell-Based Binding Assays for Anti-CXCR5 mABSA cell-based binding assay was used to characterize the anti-CXCR5 mAbs. For example, the CXCR5-expressing transfected cells described above, such as hCXCR5/HEK293, can be used. A full-length human CXCR5 open reading frame was cloned into a vector, for example, pCDNA3.1neo DEST (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). The CXCR5-coding region was synthesized by RT-PCR using human brain and liver RNA (Ambion, Inc., Austin, Tex.) as a template. The final plasmid construct, CXCR5/CDNA3.1neo, expressed a full-length CXCR5 protein. A stable cell line expressing CXCR5 was generated by transfection of CXCR5/pCDNA3.1neo plasmid construct into CHO or HEK293 cells (ATCC No. CRL-1573) using a standard and commercially available Lipofectamine 2000 kit. After transfection, the cells were cultured in DMEM overnight, then reseeded in medium with 200 jag/ml neomycin and cultured for 12-14 days. Isolated single colonies were picked and grown in separate wells until enough clonal cells were amplified. Stable clones resistant to neomycin and which expressed high levels of CXCR5 protein were identified by FACS analysis using polyclonal anti-CXCR5 antibodies (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.) or custom generated polyclonal antibodies.</p>Human HS Sultan cells (ATCC No. CRL-1484) naturally expressing CXCR5 were also confirmed for CXCR5 expression by FACS analysis. HS Sultan cells were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum, 0.2 mM of glutamine and 0.1% pen/strep solution (100 \u03bcg/ml penicillin and 10 \u03bcg/ml"
