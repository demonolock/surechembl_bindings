    "FuGene\u2122. 30 h after transfection, 100 \u03bcg cycloheximide (Sigma) was added to each 60 mm dish for 0, 30, 60 min. Cells were harvested and lysed. Equal amount of protein were resolved via SDS-PAGE (10%) and blotted onto nitrocellulose paper. Diap1 was monitored by Western blot analysis using anti-Diap1 antibody and ECL. </p> Sequence Alignments </p> The NCBI BLAST was used for sequence analysis. </p> Antibodies, Immunohistochemistry and Western Blots </p> GST-DIAP<sup>16 </sup>was expressed in BL21 (pLysS) bacteria, and was gel purified prior to rabbit immunization with the construct (Cocalico Biologicals). diap1(WT)-pET14b was used to express His-DIAP1 in BL21(pLysS), was purified according to the manufacturer's protocol (Novagen) and immobilized on nitrocellulose paper for affinity purification of anti-DIAP1 antisera. Rabbit anti-\u03b2-galactosidase antibody (Cappel, ICN), mouse-anti-\u03b2-galactosidase antibody (Sigma), monoclonal anti-Engrailed antibody (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), Rabbit CM1 antibody<sup>24 </sup>and mouse anti-HA antibody (Babco) were used to stain embryos and imaginal discs under standard conditions. For western blots, 6-18 hour embryos were homogenized in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 2 mM DTT) and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was run on 15% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose sheets and probed with Rabbit anti-DIAP1 antibody. Western blots were detected with ECL (Amersham). </p> IAP-E2 Binding Assay for Measuring Self-Conjugation </p><sup>35</sup>S-methionine labeled DIAP1 or XIAP was generated in an in vitro transcription-translation system (Promega) from diap1-pET14b and xiap-pcDNA3.1 respectively. For purification of His-UBCD1 and His-UBCH5C, ubcD1-pET14b and ubcH5C-pT7-7 were expressed in BL21 (pLysS) and purified on a Ni-column according to the manufacturer's protocol (Novagen). <sup>35</sup>S-DIAP1 or <sup>35</sup>S-XIAP was incubated with purified UBCD1 or UBCH5C respectively in the absence or presence of the W-7, H2-9 or H2-9W7 peptides. Following incubation of 15 min in room temperature in 20 mM Tris pH7.6, 2 mM DTT, Ni-NTA Agarose beads (Qiagen) were added for additional 30 minutes. The beads were subsequently washed four times with the Tris/DTT buffer, eluted with Laeinli buffer and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. <sup>35</sup>S-DIAP1 or <sup>35</sup>S-XIAP was visualized by Phosphorimaging. </p> In vitro Ubiquitination Reaction </p><sup>35</sup>S-methionine labeled mutant and wild type DIAP1, or wild type XIAP were generated in an in vitro transcription-translation system (Promega) from diap1-pET14b, diap1<sup>21</sup>l<sup>4</sup>S pET14b and xiap pcDNA3.1 plasmids. For purification of His-UBCD1 and His-UBCH5C, ubcD1-pET14b and ubcH5C-pT7-7 were expressed in BL21 (pLysS) and purified on a Ni-column according to the manufacturer's protocol (Novagen). In vitro ubiquitination assays were carried out in a total volume of 12.5 1l and contained: 35S methi"
