    "ly(4-sec-butylphenyl methacrylate), poly(3- ethylphenyl acrylate), and poly(2-methyl-l-naphthyl methacrylate). Examples of suitable poly(aryloxyalkyl (meth)acrylates) include poly(phenoxyethyl acrylate), polyCphenoxyethyl methacrylate), and poly(polyethylene glycol phenyl ether acrylate) and poly(polyethylene glycol phenyl ether methacrylate) with varying polyethylene glycol molecular weights. Examples of suitable poly(alkoxyaryl(meth)acrylates) include poly(4-methoxyphenyl methacrylate), poly(2-ethoxyphenyl acrylate) and poly(2-methoxynaphthyl acrylate). Acrylate or methacrylate monomers or polymers and/or their parent alcohols are commercially available from Sigma-Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI) or from Polysciences, Inc, (Warrington, PA).</p>The coating or matrix can also be formed by a mixture of two or more biostable polymers. For example, in one embodiment, the polymeric coating composition comprises poly(n-butyl)methacrylate (\"pBMA\") and poly(ethylene-co- vinyl acetate) copolymers as the second polymer (\"pEVA\"). An exemplary absolute polymer concentration is in the range of about 0.05% to about 70% by weight of the coating composition. As used herein \"absolute polymer concentration\" refers to the total combined concentrations of first polymer and second polymer in the coating composition. In one embodiment, the coating composition comprises polyalkyl(meth)acrylate (such as poly(n-butyl)methacrylate) with a weight average molecular weight in the range of about 100 kilodaltons (kD) to about 1000 kD and a pEVA copolymer with a vinyl acetate content in the range of about 10% to about 90% by weight of the pEVA copolymer. In a particular embodiment, the polymer composition comprises polyalkyl(meth)acrylate (such as poly(n-butyl)methacrylate) with a molecular weight in the range of about 200 kD to about 500 kD and a pEVA copolymer with a vinyl acetate content in the range of about 30% to about 34% by weight. The concentration of the bioactive agent in the polymeric coating composition of this embodiment can be in the range of about 0.01% to about 90% by weight, based upon the weight of the final coating composition.</p>Exemplary mixtures of biostable polymers are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,214,901 (Chudzik et al.) and U.S. Publication No. 2002/0188037 Al (Chudzik et \n\n al.) (each commonly assigned to the assignee of the present invention). These documents describe polymer mixtures of poly(butylmethacrylate) (pBMA) and poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) (pEVA).</p>Other useful mixtures of polymers that can be included in the coating or matrix are described in U.S. Publication No. 2004/004791 1. This publication describes polymer blends that include poly(ethylene-co-methacrylate) and a polymer selected from the group consisting of a poly(vinyl alkylate), a poly(vinyl alkyl ether), a poly(vinyl acetal), a poly(alkyl and/or aryl methacrylate) or a poly(alkyl and/or aryl acrylate); not including pEVA. The biostable polymeric material can also be a styrene copolymer, such as poly(styrene-isobutylene-styrene); the preparation of poly(styrene-isobutylene- styrene)-based coatings is described in, for example, U.S. Patent No. 6,669,980. In other forms of the present invention, the device includes a coating or a matrix comprising a biodegradable polymer. The coating or matrix can be form"
