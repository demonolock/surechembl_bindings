These receptors, which are divided pharmacologically into \u03b1-1, \u03b1-2 and \u03b2-adrenergic receptor types, are involved in diverse physiological functions including functions of the cardiovascular and central nervous systems. The \u03b1-adrenergic receptors mediate most excitatory functions: \u03b1-1 adrenergic receptors generally mediate responses in the effector organ, while \u03b1-2 adrenergic receptors are located postsynaptically as well as presynaptically, where they regulate release of neurotransmitters. Agonists of \u03b1-2 adrenergic receptors currently are used clinically in the treatment of hypertension, glaucoma, spasticity, and attention-deficit disorder, in the suppression of opiate withdrawal, and as adjuncts to general anesthesia.</p>The \u03b1-2 adrenergic receptors presently are classified into three subtypes based on their pharmacological and molecular characterization: \u03b1-2A/D (\u03b1-2A in human and \u03b1-2D in rat) ; \u03b1-2B; and \u03b1-2C (Bylund et al . , Pharmacol . Rev. 46:121-136 (1994); and Hein and Kobilka, Neuropharmacol. 34:357-366 (1995)). The \u03b1-2A and \u03b1-2B subtypes can regulate arterial contraction in some vascular beds, and the \u03b1-2A and \u03b1-2C subtypes mediate feedback inhibition of norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerve endings. The \u03b1-2A subtype also mediates many of the central effects of \u03b1-2 adrenergic agonists (Calzada and Arti\u00f1ano, Pharmacol. Res. 44: 195-208 (2001); Hein et al., Ann. NY Acad. Science 881:265-271 (1999); and Karger (Ed.), \u03b1-Adrenoreceptors: Molecular Biology, Biochemistry and Pharmacology (1991)),</p>Although non-selective \u03b1-adrenergic agonists having \u03b1-2A agonist activity, such as clonidine and dexmeditomidine, have been used for the treatment of various types of pain, such drugs must be administered spinally to achieve analgesia that is separable from sedation. The central analgesic effect of such pan-agonists is mediated by the \u03b1-2A receptor expressed in the dorsal horn within the spinal column. The present invention is based on the surprising discovery that, in contrast to the pro-analgesic function of the \u03b1-2A receptor in the spinal column, a peripheral \u03b1-2A receptor mediates pain. The invention further is based on identification of a peripherally expressed adrenergic receptor, the \u03b1-2B receptor, which, when activated, can produce peripheral analgesia.</p>As disclosed herein, \u03b1-adrenergic agonists with \u03b1-2A activity such as the pan-agonists clonidine or brimonidine produce no significant analgesia separable from sedation upon peripheral administration to wild type animals. However, analgesia separable from sedation was observed in \u03b1-2A knockout mice treated peripherally with these drugs. Furthermore, analge",
    "orepinephrine. A pan-\u03b1-2 agonist has, at a minimum, greater than 25% efficacy relative to brimonidine at each of the \u03b1-2A, \u03b1-2B and \u03b1-2C receptors; in particular embodiments, a method of the invention is practiced with a pan-\u03b1-2 agonist having greater than 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100% or 200% efficacy relative to brimonidine at the \u03b1-2A, \u03b1-2B and \u03b1-2C adrenergic receptors. It is understood that the efficacy of a pan-\u03b1-2 agonist can be different at the various \u03b1-2 receptors; as an example, a pan-\u03b1-2 agonist can have greater than 25% efficacy at the \u03b1-2A receptor, greater than 80% efficacy at the \u03b1-2B receptor and greater than 40% efficacy at the \u03b1-2C receptor.</p>The term \"pan-\u03b1-1 pan-\u03b1-2 agonist,\" as used herein, means a compound having greater than 25% efficacy relative to phenylephrine at all \u03b1-1 receptors and having greater than 25% efficacy relative to brimonidine at all \u03b1-2 adrenergic receptors. In particular embodiments, a method of the invention relies on a pan-\u03b1-1 pan-\u03b1-2 agonist having greater than 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100% or 200% efficacy at all \u03b1-1 and \u03b1-2 receptors relative to phenylephrine or brimonidine, respectively.</p>As disclosed herein, a selective \u03b1-2A antagonist is administered in conjunction with an \u03b1-adrenergic agonist to alleviate pain or for the long-term relief of chronic pain. As used herein, the term \"selective \u03b1-2A antagonist\" means a compound having (1) an efficacy of less than 25% relative to brimonidine at \u03b1-2A; (2) a Ki of less than 100 nM at \u03b1-2A; and further having (3) at least a 10-fold greater Ki at \u03b1-2B than at \u03b1-2A or an efficacy of greater than 25% relative to brimonidine at \u03b1-2B. From this definition, it is clear to the skilled person that non-selective antagonists such as rauwolscine are not included within the scope of this term. Exemplary selective \u03b1-2A antagonists are provided herein as Compound 13, BRL 48962 and BRL 44408. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, amides, sterioisomers and racemic mixtures of these compounds also are useful in the invention. A selective \u03b1-2A antagonist can be a peripherally limited compound. Such a compound does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier and, thus, upon peripheral administration, is excluded from the central nervous system.</p>In addition to \u03b1-2A antagonist activity, a \"selective \u03b1-2A antagonist\" also can have agonist or antagonist activity at one or more adrenergic or other receptors, provided that the compound satisfies the three criteria set forth above. As an example, a compound having \u03b1-2C antagonist activity, characterized by a Ki at \u03b1-2C of less than 100 nM and an efficacy at \u03b1-2C of less than 25% relative to brimonidine, and further having (1) an efficacy of less than 25% relative to brimonidine at \u03b1-2A, a Ki of less than 100 nM at \u03b1-2A, and (3) at least a 10-fold greater Ki at \u03b1-2B than at \u03b1-2A is encompassed by the term \"selective \u03b1-2A antagonist\" as defined herein. Similarly, compounds exhibiting \u03b1-2B or other agonist activity in addition to \u03b1-2A antagonist activity also are encompassed by the term \"selective \u03b1-2A antagonist,\" As an example, Compound 13 exhibits \u03b1-2B agonist activity characterized by about 40% efficacy at \u03b1-2B relative to brimonidine, thus satisfying criteria (3), and further has (1) an efficacy of 5% relative to brimonidine at \u03b1-2A and (2) a Ki of about 0.08 nM at \u03b1-2A and, therefore, falls within the definition of the term \"selective \u03b1-2A antagonist\" as used herein. In particular embodiments, a method of the invention is practiced with a selective \u03b1-2A antagonist having a Ki of less than 80 nM, 60 nM, 40 nM, 20 nM, 10 nM, 1 nM or 0.1 nM. In further embodiments, a method of the invention is practiced with a selective \u03b1-2A antagonist having at least a 20-fold, 30-fold, 40-fold, 50-fold, 100-fold, 200-fold, 500-fold or 1000-fold greater Ki at \u03b1-2B than at \u03b1-2A. In still further embodiments, a method of the invention is practiced with a selective \u03b1-2A antagonist having an efficacy of greater than 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100% or 200% relative to brimonidine at \u03b1-2B.</p>In one embodiment, the invention relies on a selective \u03b1-2A antagonist with minimal \u03b1-2B antagonist activity. As used herein, the term \"selective \u03b1-2A antagonist with minimal \u03b1-2B antagonist activity\" means a selective \u03b1-2A antagonist, as defined hereinabove, further having a Ki at \u03b1-2B greater than 100 nM. As non-limiting examples, such an antagonist can have a Ki at \u03b1-2B of greater than 200 nM, 300 nM, 400 nM, 500 nM, 1000 nM, 2000 nM, 3000 nM, 4000 nM or 5000 nM.</p>A specific \u03b1-2A antagonist also can be used to prevent \u03b1-2A receptor activation in a method of the invention. As used herein, the term \"specific \u03b1-2A antagonist\" means a compound having (1) an efficacy of less than 25% relative to brimonidine at \u03b1-2A; (2) a Ki of less than 100 nM at \u03b1-2A; and further having (3) at each of the \u03b1-adrenergic receptors other than \u03b1-2A either at least a 10-fold greater Ki than at \u03b1-2A or an efficacy of greater than 25% relative to brimonidine or phenylephrine.</p>The present invention also provides compositions and methods which rely on an \u03b1-adrenergic agonist with minimal \u03b1-2A agonist activity. In particular, the present invention provides an analgesic composition that contains an \u03b1-adrenergic agonist with minimal \u03b1-2A agonist activity having the ability to produce peripheral analgesia without concomitant sedation. In one embodiment, the analgesic composition produces peripheral analgesia without concomitant sedation and in the substantial absence of hypotensive effects. In another embodiment, the invention provides an analgesic composition that produces peripheral analgesia sufficient to reduce pain by at least 50% without concomitant sedation. In further embodiments, at least a 10-fold, 100-fold or 1000-fold greater dose of the analgesic composition is required to produce a 20% reduction in motor or muscular activity than the dose of the analgesic composition required to reduce pain by at least 50%. In yet a further embodiment, the invention provides an analgesic composition that produces peripheral analgesia sufficient to reduce pain by at least 50% without concomitant sedation and in the substantial absence of hypotensive effects. In another embodiment, the invention provides an analgesic composition that contains an \u03b1-adrenergic agonist with minimal \u03b1-2A agonist activity having the ability to produce peripheral analgesia without conco",
    "efficacy relative to brimonidine at \u03b1-2C; (2) a potency of less than 1000 nM at \u03b1-2C or at least 100-fold greater potency at \u03b1-2C than \u03b1-2A; (3) less than 25% efficacy or 50-fold less potency relative to brimonidine at \u03b1-2A and \u03b1-2B; (4) less than 25% efficacy or 50-fold less potency relative to phenylephrine at all \u03b1-1 receptors; and (5) the ability to produce peripheral analgesia without concomitant sedation in genetically unaltered animals.</p>Agonist and antagonist activity, including selectivity and specificity, can be characterized using any of a variety of routine assays, including, without limitation, Receptor Selection and Amplification Technology (RSAT) assays (Messier et al., Pharmacol. Toxicol. 76:308-11 (1995); Conklin et al., Nature 363:274-6 (1993)) ; cyclic AMP assays (Shimizu et al., J. Neurochem. 16:1609-1619 (1969)) ; and cytosensor microphysiometry assays (Neve et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267:25748-25753 (1992)). Such assays generally are performed using cells that naturally express only a single \u03b1-adrenergic receptor subtype, or using transfected cells expressing a single recombinant \u03b1-adrenergic receptor subtype. The adrenergic receptor can be a human receptor or homolog thereof having a similar pharmacology. As disclosed herein, RSAT assays were performed using cells transiently transfected with human \u03b1-2A (c10 gene); rat \u03b1-2B (RNG gene); human \u03b1-2C (c4 gene); bovine \u03b1-1A; hamster \u03b1-1B; and rat \u03b1-1D. The RSAT assay measures receptor-mediated loss of contact inhibition resulting in selective proliferation of receptor-containing cells in a mixed population of confluent cells. The increase in cell number is assessed with an appropriate detectable marker gene such as \u03b2-galactosidase, if desired, in a high throughput or ultra high throughput assay format. Receptors that activate the G protein, Gq, elicit the proliferative response. \u03b1-adrenergic receptors, which normally couple to Gi, activate the RSAT response when coexpressed with a hybrid Gq protein containing a Gi receptor recognition domain, designated Gq/i5.</p>As an example, an RSAT assay can be performed essentially as follows. NIH-3T3 cells are plated at a density of 2 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells in 15 cm dishes and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. One day later, cells are cotransfected by calcium phosphate precipitation with mammalian expression plasmids encoding p-SV-\u03b2-galactosidase (5-10 \u00b5g), receptor (1-2 \u00b5g) and G protein (1-2 \u00b5g). Carrier DNA, for example 40 \u00b5g salmon sperm DNA, also can be included to increase transfection efficiency. Fresh media is added on the following day; one to two days later, cells are harvested and frozen in 50 assay aliquots. Transfected cells are thawed, and 100 \u00b5l of cells added to 100 \u00b5l aliquots of compound to be tested, with various concentrations assayed in triplicate, for example, in 96-well plates. Incubation continues for 72 to 96 hours at 37\u00b0. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, "
