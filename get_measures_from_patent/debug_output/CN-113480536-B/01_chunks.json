    "ivoThe positive control selected the first line drug gemcitabine for pancreatic cancer, administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg by tail vein once every three days, with poor metabolic stability. The experimental results (A-C in FIG. 1) show that compound 36l significantly inhibited the growth of PDX tumors with a tumor inhibition rate of 57.3%. From the tumor weight and volume changes, there was a significant difference between the drug group and the blank group (P&lt;0.05. ) Although the tumor inhibition rate of compound 36l was not as good as that of gemcitabine, 36l was the highest of the existing KRAS-PDE delta inhibitors and was also the only KRAS-PDE delta inhibitor effective in the pancreatic cancer PDX model. This result further demonstrates the proprietary potential of KRAS-PDE delta interactions, which is of great significance in the discovery of clinical applications of KRAS-PDE delta inhibitors.</p><p id=\"p0124\" num=\"0119\">To further verify the effect of the drug on tumor tissue, PDX tumors tested in vivo were prepared into tissue sections and stained for analysis. Pathological changes in tumor tissue were first assessed by hematoxylin-eosin staining (hematoxylin and eosin stain, H &amp; E stain). As shown in FIG. 1, the 36l group showed a marked increase in hyaluronan in tumor tissue compared to the blank group, demonstrating that compound 36l induced aging and death of tumor cells in vivo. The number of proliferating cells in the tumor tissue was further examined by Ki-67 immunohistochemical staining to assess the intensity of proliferation capacity in different groups of tumors. The results showed (D-E in FIG. 1) that 36l of tumor sections from the drug-treated group showed a significant decrease in the number of proliferating cells, while the same inhibition was observed with the gemcitabine tumor sections. The histological section staining results further demonstrate that compound 36l is able to significantly inhibit the proliferation of pancreatic cancer in vivo.</p><p id=\"p0125\" num=\"0120\">The foregoing description is only a preferred embodiment of the present invention, but the scope of the present invention is not limited thereto, and any person skilled in the art who is skilled in the art should make equivalent substitutions or modifications according to the technical solution of the present invention and the inventive concept thereof within the scope of the present invention.</p></mode-for-invention></description>"
