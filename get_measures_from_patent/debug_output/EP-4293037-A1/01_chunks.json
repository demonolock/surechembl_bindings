    "imize the therapeutic regimen for an individual subject or a group of subjects.</p>The diseases include but are not limited to stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, neurodegenerative diseases, depression, and autism.</p>The neurodegenerative diseases refer to Multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, or Huntington's disease.</p>According to reports, DAPK1 is activated and leads to the phosphorylation of Protein Kinase D1 (PKD1), which interacts with DAPK1, in 293T cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells following oxidative stress damage. The activation of PKD1 is critical for binding to Apoptosis Signal-regulated Kinase 1 (ASK1) and for the phosphorylation of c-N-terminal kinase (JNK), which is induced downstream. Studies have also shown that the ASK1-dependent JNK signaling pathway mediates cysteine-dependent apoptosis and non-cysteine-dependent necrosis in cells after ischemia. However, there have been no reports confirming whether the DAPK1-PKD1 pathway in neurons is involved in the cascade reaction that leads to cell death under ischemia and hypoxia. It is unclear whether interfering with or blocking the DAPK1-PKD1 pathway can effectively reduce ischemic neuronal damage and become a new molecular target for developing drugs to treat ischemic stroke.</p>The inventors hypothesized the effect of the DAPK1-PKD1 pathway on ischemic neuronal damage and designed a PKD interfering peptide based on this hypothesis. A series of small-molecule peptides with the same motif were derived from this peptide. These peptides were tested in cell and animal models, and the technical solution of the invention was obtained. PKD1 refers to protein kinase D1, a serine/threonine kinase belonging to the protein kinase D (PKD) family that is widely expressed in cells and has unique structural, enzymatic, and regulatory characteristics. The PKD family has three members, PKD1, PKD2, and PKD3. Among them, PKD1 has been studied the most, and it is generally believed that PKD2 and PKD1 are similar in distribution and function, while PKD3 mainly shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. In terms of structural domains, the three members of PKD have a high degree of homology. PKD has been reported to participate in a variety of cellular functions, including Golgi organization and membrane-guided transport, transfer, immune response, cell apoptosis, and cell proliferation (doi:10.1152/physiol.00037.2010 and Advances in Physiology Education, Vol. 42, No. 5, 2011).</p>The short peptide drugs developed by the present invention were applied to in vitro oxidative stress injury models and in vivo animal stroke models. The experimental data demonstrate that the short peptide drugs developed by the present invention have significant neuroprotective effects in the glutamate-induced apoptosis model. They can effectively inhibit primary neuronal cell damage caused by oxygen glucose deprivation by interfering with the DAPK1-PKD1 pathway in neurons, inhibiting downstream signals that lead to neuronal cysteine-dependent apoptosis and non-cysteine-dependent necrosis, and reducing brain damage after ischemic stroke. Therefore, the short interference peptides developed by the present invention can be used to prepare therapeutic or prophylactic drugs related to the mechanism of excitatory amino acid toxicity for diseases, including but not limited to stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, neurodegenerative diseases (such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease), depression, and autism.</p>Term DefinitionNatural amino acids: The 20 conve",

The peptides were synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) using Fmoc chemistry.</p>The process of SPPS includes adding amino acids to the resin one after the other to create the peptide chain. After the synthesis is completed, the Fmoc group is deprotected at the N-terminal, and then the side chain protecting group is deprotected, and then the peptide is cleaved off the resin; The peptide was purified by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) with acetonitrile plus deionized water and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) as buffer for gradient elution, r",
    "s near the arteriotomy. Following removal of the filament, the knot was tightened in the ECA. The microvascular clip placed in the CCA was removed. When reperfusion was confirmed, the neck skin was sutured. To relieve pain and discomfort in the postoperative period, topical lidocaine gel was applied to the incision region, and the animal received 1.0 mL of normal saline subcutaneously as volume replenishment after the surgery. Sham animals underwent identical procedures without MCAO. At 4.5 h after MCAO, agents were administrated with a volume of 3.5mg/2ml/kg intravenously within 3 min. The rat's body temperature during the recovery time is maintained at 37\u00b0 C with a heat lamp.</p>2.Brain tissue processing and Infarct volume measurement24 hours post reperfusion, deeply anesthetized rat was sacrificed and whole brain tissues were removed and coronal sectioned into 2 mm thick slices followed by staining immediately with a 1% 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium (TTC) solution for 15 minutes at 37\u00b0C. The area of the left hemisphere and the unstained area (un-infarcted area) of the right hemisphere were calculated using Image J. (an image processing program developed by the National Institutes of Health) , the percentage of infarction was calculated as follows: Percentage of cerebral infarction area =[ (left hemisphere area - right inferior brain infarct size)/left hemisphere area] x 100%.</p>Results: As shown in Figure 5(A, B, C), to examine the therapeutic effective treatment of RvTAT-PKD-S205 in-vivo, a post treatment study was conducted with 90 minutes transient MCAO model. SD rats were assigned into 2 groups with either saline alone (control) or saline plus PKD peptide (3.5 mg/kg) treatments by single bolus intravenous injection. RvTAT-PKD-S205 (SEQ ID NO: 1) (n=13) and Saline (n=12) were given 4.5 hours after ischemia onset. Infarct volume (brain injure) was assessed by TTC staining after about 24 hours after MCAO onset. Post treatment with RvTAT-PKD-S205 statistically significantly reduced the volume of total cerebral infarction by approximately 60% as compared with stroke volume in controls after a MCAO stroke (FIG. 5B, C). This result demonstrates that RvTAT-PKD-S205 can act in vivo to reduce ischemic stroke-induced brain injury.</p>3.Assessment of motor functional performance by rotarodSD rats were tested serially for motor function before and 7 days after focal cerebral ischemia using a Rotarod. Three days prior to MCAO/R surgery, rats were trained on the rotarod for three consecutive days. The initial starting ramp was set at 4 rpm to ensure that animals can be maintained on a rotating pole for 1 minute. After a 10 minutes rest, rats increased steadily up to 20 rpm at 180 seconds and were trained to stay more than 150 seconds on the rod. Animals unable to remain in place on the stationary rod for this duration were repositioned serially until able to do so in the following two days. A trial ended if the animal fell off the rungs or gripped the device and spun around for 2 consecutive revolutions without attempting to walk on the rungs. The duration that rat were able to stay on the rotarod was measured. The mean duration on the device was recorded with 3 rotarod measurements one day before surgery. Rotarod sessions were undertaken on day 3, day 5 and day 7 after MCAO/R (or after sham surgery). For each date of post-ischemic examination, Measurements were taken in triplicate and averaged for each time point. The animal was allowed 15 minutes of rest between each attempt.</p>Result: To further examine the neurological deficit recovery of TAT-PKD-5205 in-vivo, a post treatment study was conducted with 90 minutes transient MCAO model. Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned into 3 groups: Sham group (No MCAO/R) (n=8), saline group (control) (n=6) or saline plus PKD peptide treatment group (3.5 mg/kg) (n=6). The saline plus PKD peptide treatment group and saline group were give a single dose of TAT-PKD-S205 and saline via tail vein injection 4.5 hours after ischemia onset.Neurological deficit was assessed by Rotarod test at day3, 5 and 7 after MCAO onset.</p>The motor performance of post treatment with TAT-PKD-S205 rats were significant improved after tMCAO/R. Holding time on rod increase 70% at 5 days and 75% 7 days after tMCAO, respectively, compared to the untreated control group. there were no significant differences in the mean holding time between treated and untreated groups at 3 days after tMCAO (Figure 5D, sham-operated group n = 8, saline group n = 6, RvTATPKD-S205 group n = 10). The results demonstrated that RvTAT-PKD-S205 significantly improved the neurobehavioral induced by ischemic stroke in rats.</p>4.Transient Bilateral Common Carotid Artery Occlusion (tBCCAO) induced cerebral ischemia and agent administration in mice.Modeling: C57 BL/6 male mice weighing 20-30 g (6-7 weeks old) were allowed free access to food and water and were housed under constant environmental conditions (a 12/12 h light/dark cycle). In short, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 10% chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg) and placed on heating pad to maintain rectal temperature at 37\u00b0C and BCCAO surgery was performed according to previously established method. Mouse ventral neck region was shaved. Area was treated with betadine solution then 70% ethanol to cleanse. A small midline skin incision was made in neck. Dissect the medial sternocleidomastoid muscle and isolated carefully from the vagus nerve and connective tissue to expose both common carotid arteries. Non-traumatic vessel clamps were applied to occlude each artery for 20 minutes. The clips were removed, and the blood flow restored for 10 minutes. Then the bilateral common carotid arteries were occlusion again for another 20 minutes and reperfusion for 24 hours. At 3 hours after tBCCAO, agents were administrated with a volume of 7mg/2ml/kg intravenously within 3 min. The mouse's body temperature during the recovery time is maintain at 37\u00b0 C with a heat lamp. Sham control animals underwent all the surgical procedure except occlusion of BCCAO.</p>Experiment: Examine Learning and memory abilities of tBCCAO/R by Passive Avoidance assayThe Y-maze apparatus consisted of three arms (A, B, and C) at 120\u00b0 angle, connected by a central zone (CZ). The electricity grid (made of stainless steel) was placed underneath each arm; the outer end of each arm had a light bulb providing the light source of the safe zone. Any of the three arms could be set as the starting zone through the computer, which was defined as a non-safe zone after the experiment began. The remaining two arms were randomly divided into a safe zone without foot shock (current stimulation) and a non-safe zone with foot shock by Y-maze video tracking and analysis system.</p>To examine the therapeutic effect of RvTAT-PKD-S205 peptide on overall cognitive memory deficit improvement in-vivo following stroke, a post treatment study was conducted using a global cerebral ischemia model of transient occlusion and reperfusion of bilateral common carotid arteries and reperfusion model (tBCCAO/R) in mice. In this model, tBCCAO/R primarily caused damage to the hippocampus and impaired the animals' cognitive and memory functions.</p>The day before surgery, the researchers train the mice to avoid electric shocks caused by light sources, which can minimize the effects of odor. C57BL/6 mice were assigned into 3 groups (n=11 each group): Sham group (No BCCAO), saline group (control) or saline plus RvTAT-PKD-S205 peptide treatment group (7 mg/kg) TAT-PKD-S205 and Saline are given via tail vein injection 3 hours after modeling. Learning and memory skill was quantified by Y maze passive avoidance task 24 hours after tBCCAO/R modeling (Figure 6A).</p>After 24 hrs BCCAO/R mice were acclimatized to the testing room before conducting the Y-maze and allowed to familiarize themselves with the maze. After 3 min, mice were put in starting area to begin the experiment. A current stimulation of pre-determined intensity (0.05-0.8mA) will be administered. The animal must escape into the adjoining safe zone to avoid receiving the foot shock and keep there for 30 sec. Following the completion of a trial, the animal is replaced in the start location and subsequent trials are completed. The number to escape to the safe zone was recorded; any escapes to non-safe zones were regarded as erroneous. The mean often testing sessions was taken to calculate the average escape percentage. Between animals, the apparatus is completely cleaned with disinfectant and/or alcohol spray.</p>Results: The activity status of each mouse was determined by the percentage of correct avoidance, and observations showed that mice in the RvTAT-PKD-S205 treated group significantly increased the percentage of successful avoidance compared to the saline treated group. RvTAT-PKDS205 peptide improved the decrease in memory index caused by tBCCAO/R, resulting in a 30% increase in memory index in the treated group compared to the untreated group (as shown in Figure 6B). These results suggest that the RvTAT-PKD1-5205 treatment effectively reduces hippocampal neurogenic damage following Globle brain ischemia.</p>Mice tBCCAO/R Malondialdehyde (MDA) AssayMDA is one of the important products of lipid peroxidation and the extent of lipid oxidation was determined by measuring MDA levels. MDA levels in tissues were estimated by the thiobarbituric acid (TBA) method. After the behavior test, the mice were decapitated, and the brain tissues were taken. The hippocampus from brain were homogenized in ice-cold Saline. The supernatants were collected after the lysates were centrifuged at 3,500 r/min for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C, and MDA content was determined using MDA TCA kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China) following the manufacturer's protocol. The results were evaluated from the standard curve and calculated as nM/mg of tissue.</p>Assessment of brain edema in tBCCAO/R miceMice were assessed for brain edema by the dry/wet weight measurement after 24 hrs BCCAO/R. Wet weight was determined immediately after dissection of the brain, then the tissue was dried at 55\u00b0C to a constant weight over 24 hours to determine the dry weight. The percentage of brain water content was calculated as (wet weight - dry weight)/wet weight* 100.</p>Result: The concentration of MDA in brain tissue was used to assess the severity of neuronal ischemic injury. In comparison to mice treated with saline, the brains of mice treated with RvTAT-PKD-S205 showed a 55% decrease in MDA level, significantly inhibiting the growth of MDA following neuronal ischemic injury (Figure 6C). Brain edema was also evaluated by measuring brain water content, which was reduced by 8.5% after RvTAT-PKD-S205 treatment compared to saline controls (Figure 6D). The results indicate that RvTAT-PKD-S205 attenuates brain edema and oxidative stress injury in the experimental tBCCAO/R model.</p>Statistical Analysis: In the overall animal experiments, a double-blind approach was maintained for the experimental drug group and the control group (sterile saline) during stroke model preparation and assessment of stroke identification and testing parameters. All data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM. Data from more than two groups were analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc tests or unpaired two-tailed t-tests with the control group. Multiple comparisons were performed with the control group using post hoc tests or unpaired two-tailed t-tests to assess the difference in means between the treated and untreated control groups. When the data did not meet the ANOVA assumptions described above, multiple comparisons were performed between a nonparametric ANOVA (Kruskal-Wallis ranked one-way analysis of variance) with controls (Dunn method). A value *p&lt;0 .05, **p&lt;0 .01, and ***p&lt;0 .005 were considered statistically significant when comparisons were made.</p>VII. Comparison of different fusion peptidesThe study involved the synthesis of fusion peptides containing the interfering peptides listed in Table 1. These fusion peptides were tested separately on both the HT22 cell line glutamate attack model and the primary neuronal culture OGD model.</p>In the OGD model it was found that:\nRvTAT-PKD-S205 (SEQ ID NO .1 with the cell penetrating peptides linked at the N-terminal end) provided and its homologous interfering peptides (each one of SEQ ID NO .23 to SEQ ID NO .39 in Table 1 with the cell penetrating peptides attached at the N- or C-terminal) provided significant neuroprotection, reducing cortical neuronal death by 12% and 18% in a dose-dependent manner at 300 and 1000 nM, respectively.</p>RvTAT-ZIPK-T299 (SEQ ID NO .2 with cell penetrating peptide linked at the N-terminal end) and its homologous interfering peptide (each one of SEQ ID NO .8 to SEQ ID NO .22 in Table 1 with cell penetrating peptide attached at the N-terminal end or C) were also effective in reducing cortical neuronal death by 12% at 1000 nM</p>RvTAT-opMLC-S20 (SEQ ID NO .4 with the cell penetrating peptide linked at the N-terminal end) peptide did not significantly increase the survival of neurons. With RvTAT-PKD-S205, RvTAT -ZIPK-T299 and RvTAT-opMLC-S20 as examples, the results of comparative neuroprotection experiments are shown in Figure 3.</p>In the glutamate insult model, it was found that RvTAT-PKD-S205 (N-terminal of SEQ ID NO.1 attached to the cell penetrating peptide) and its homologous interfering peptide (N-terminal or C -terminal of each of SEQ ID NO .23 to SEQ ID NO .39 in Table 1 linked to a cell penetrating peptide) and RvTATZIPK -T299 (N-terminal of SEQ ID NO .2 with cell penetrating peptide linked) and their homologous interfering peptides (N-terminal or C-terminal of each of SEQ ID NO .2 to SEQ ID NO .22 in Table attached to cell penetrating) are the more promising neuroprotective peptides, and both groups of peptides reduce HT22 cell death by an average of about 33%, followed by RvTAT -rSP6-S235 (SEQ ID NO .3 with cell penetrating peptide linked to the N terminus) and its homologous interfering peptide (SEQ ID NO .40 to SEQ ID NO .54 in Table 1 with cell penetrating peptide linked to its N terminus or C terminus), RvTAT-opMLC - S20 (N-terminal of SEQID NO .4 linked to a cell penetrating peptide) and RvTAT-BECN1-T199 (N-terminal of SEQ ID NO .5 linked to a cell penetrating peptide) and their homologous interfering peptides N-terminal or C-linked SEQ ID NO .6 \u223c7 linkedcell penetrating peptide) reduced HT22 cell death by an average of about 29%, 25%, and 21% at 400 nM, respectively. With RvTAT-PKD-S205, RvTAT-rSP6-S235, and RvTAT-opMLC-S20 and RvTAT-BECN1-T199 as examples, and the results are shown in Figure 4.</p>The above results also indicate that although all interfering peptides interact with the phosphorylated functional domain of DAPK1, different DAPK1 substrate motif interfering peptides differed in their neuroprotective efficacy, wherein RvTAT-PKD-S205 and its homologous interfering peptide were the best.</p>ReferencesDOI:10 .3969/j.issn .1000-3614 .2019 .02 .001 L Wang, J Liu, Y Yang, B Peng, Y Wang (2019) The Prevention and Treatment of Stroke Still Face Huge Challenges-Brief Report on Stroke Prevention and Treatment in China ,2018.
