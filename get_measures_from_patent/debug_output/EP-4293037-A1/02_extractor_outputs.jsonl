{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n1. RvTAT-PKD-S205 (SEQ ID NO .1 with the cell penetrating peptides linked at the N-terminal end) provided and its homologous interfering peptides (each one of SEQ ID NO .23 to SEQ ID NO .39 in Table 1 with the cell penetrating peptides attached at the N- or C-terminal) provided significant neuroprotection, reducing cortical neuronal death by 12% and 18% in a dose-dependent manner at 300 and 1000 nM, respectively.\n2. RvTAT-ZIPK-T299 (SEQ ID NO .2 with cell penetrating peptide linked at the N-terminal end) and its homologous interfering peptide (each one of SEQ ID NO .8 to SEQ ID NO .22 in Table 1 with cell penetrating peptide attached at the N-terminal end or C) were also effective in reducing cortical neuronal death by 12% at 1000 nM\n3. RvTAT-PKD-S205 (N-terminal of SEQ ID NO.1 attached to the cell penetrating peptide) and its homologous interfering peptide (N-terminal or C -terminal of each of SEQ ID NO .23 to SEQ ID NO .39 in Table 1 linked to a cell penetrating peptide) and RvTATZIPK -T299 (N-terminal of SEQ ID NO .2 with cell penetrating peptide linked) and their homologous interfering peptides (N-terminal or C-terminal of each of SEQ ID NO .2 to SEQ ID NO .22 in Table attached to cell penetrating) are the more promising neuroprotective peptides, and both groups of peptides reduce HT22 cell death by an average of about 33%, \n4. RvTAT-rSP6-S235 (SEQ ID NO .3 with cell penetrating peptide linked to the N terminus) and its homologous interfering peptide (SEQ ID NO .40 to SEQ ID NO .54 in Table 1 with cell penetrating peptide linked to its N terminus or C terminus), RvTAT-opMLC - S20 (N-terminal of SEQID NO .4 linked to a cell penetrating peptide) and RvTAT-BECN1-T199 (N-terminal of SEQ ID NO .5 linked to a cell penetrating peptide) and their homologous interfering peptides N-terminal or C-linked SEQ ID NO .6 \u223c7 linkedcell penetrating peptide) reduced HT22 cell death by an average of about 29%, 25%, and 21% at 400 nM, respectively.\n5. The concentration of MDA in brain tissue was used to assess the severity of neuronal ischemic injury. In comparison to mice treated with saline, the brains of mice treated with RvTAT-PKD-S205 showed a 55% decrease in MDA level, significantly inhibiting the growth of MDA following neuronal ischemic injury \n6. Brain edema was also evaluated by measuring brain water content, which was reduced by 8.5% after RvTAT-PKD-S205 treatment compared to saline controls \n7. RvTAT-PKD-S205 peptide improved the decrease in memory index caused by tBCCAO/R, resulting in a 30% increase in memory index in the treated group compared to the untreated group \n8. The motor performance of post treatment with TAT-PKD-S205 rats were significant improved after tMCAO/R. Holding time on rod increase 70% at 5 days and 75% 7 days after tMCAO, respectively, compared to the untreated control group."}
