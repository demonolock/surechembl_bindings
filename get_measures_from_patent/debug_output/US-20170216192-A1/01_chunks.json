Compatibility was calculated as the peroxide percent measured after 13 days at 40\u00b0 C. divided by the initial peroxide percent measured, then multiplied by 100. (Product placed at 40\u00b0 C. for 13 days represents an extended shelf life, as it is generally accepted that one month stored at 40\u00b0 C. roughly approximates storage at seven months at room temperature).</p>TABLE 6Weeks atPercentage of Peroxide Remaining40\u00b0 C.3A3B3C3D3E0100100100100100497100981009489599959688129498939786</p>TABLE 73FLANETTE W15.000%Sodium lauryl1.875%sulfate PowderWater58.125%Sodium fluoride0.243%Sucralose0.200%Flavor1.000%SODIUM ACID0.300%PYROPHOSPHATEDisodium phosphate0.200%Precipitated Silica10.000%Hydrogen peroxide8.570%(35% soln)Phosphoric Acid0.430%(estimated)Water q.s.79.057%Total =&gt;100.000%pH Target =&gt;4.5LANETTE W is a mixture of cetyl and stearyl alcohol (50:50) with sodium lauryl sulfate (approx. ratio of 90:10) commercially available from Cognis/BASF, located in Germany.ZEODENT 109 precipitated silica commercially available from the J.
