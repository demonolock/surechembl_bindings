{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences/rows that meet the criteria:\n\n\nThe binding constant of DOX to valve molecules is large, indicating that there is a strong force between DOX and valve molecules, and the value of n is slightly greater than 1 at different temperatures, indicating that each DOX molecule can bind to at least one valve molecule. At the same time, the temperature increased from 288K to 308K, and the binding constant K increased from 4571 to 7161, indicating that the temperature increase favors the binding of the valve molecules to DOX.\n\n\n\u0394G\uff1d-RTlnK\n\n\n\u0394S\uff1d(\u0394H-\u0394G)/T\n\n\nAs can be seen from Table 7, the binding constant of DOX to valve molecules is large, indicating that there is a strong force between DOX and valve molecules, and the value of n is slightly greater than 1 at different temperatures, indicating that each DOX molecule can bind to at least one valve molecule. \n\n\nAs can be seen from Table 8, \u0394 G &lt;0, indicating that binding of DOX to the molecular valve occurs spontaneously during the reaction, and \u0394 S &gt;0, indicating that the entropy-increasing process favors the spontaneous progression of the binding reaction. \u0394 H &gt;0, indicating that the reaction is endothermic, and the temperature increase favors the binding of DOX to the valve molecules, consistent with the previous conclusions.\n\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, I realize that none of these sentences contain all four required components: a specific molecule name, a bioactivity metric (IC50, Ki, Kd, EC50), a specific numeric value, and a unit. \n\nThe text does contain tables (6, 7, and 8) that might have the required information, but the tables themselves are not provided in the text snippet. If you can provide the tables, I can try to extract the relevant information."}
