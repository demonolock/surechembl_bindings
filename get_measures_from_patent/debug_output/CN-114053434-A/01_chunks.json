This experiment also analyzed the fluorescence quenching curves at different temperatures. In the experiment, the temperature is increased from 288K to 308K, the quenching constant is decreased from 1.84 to 1.27, the characteristic of static quenching, and K is known by calculation<sub>q</sub>Is much larger than the maximum rate constant (2X 10) of dynamic quenching<sup>10</sup>) It is shown that DTNB forms a non-luminescent supramolecular complex with DOX to cause static quenching of DOX fluorescence.</p>Quenching is described by regression equation, as shown in the following formula:</p>lg[(F<sub>0</sub>-F)/F]\uff1dlg K+n lg Q</p>wherein K is the binding constant of DOX and valve molecules; n is the number of binding sites, lg [ (F)<sub>0</sub>-F)/F]Plotting lg Q, K, n and the correlation coefficient R<sub>2</sub>See table 7 and fig. 14.</p>TABLE 7 binding parameters of DTNB and DOX at different temperatures</p></p>As can be seen from Table 7, the binding constant of DOX to valve molecules is large, indicating that there is a strong force between DOX and valve molecules, and the value of n is slightly greater than 1 at different temperatures, indicating that each DOX molecule can bind to at least one valve molecule. At the same time, the temperature increased from 288K to 308K, and the binding constant K increased from 4571 to 7161, indicating that the temperature increase favors the binding of the valve molecules to DOX.</p>Small organic molecule drugs can bind to valve molecules through hydrogen bonding, van der waals forces, electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobic forces, and often more than one, possibly multiple, forces act in concert. The type of intermolecular forces can be judged by calculating the change in thermodynamic parameters of the molecular binding process, Rose indicates that hydrophobic interactions can increase \u0394 H and \u0394 S of the binding process, hydrogen bonding or van der waals forces can decrease \u0394 H and \u0394 S of the system, and electrostatic interactions can cause \u0394 H \u2248 0 and \u0394 S &gt;0 of the system. \u0394 H, \u0394 S and \u0394 G of the DOX binding system to the valve molecules were calculated by the following three formulas, and the results are shown in table 8.</p></p>\u0394G\uff1d-RTlnK</p>\u0394S\uff1d(\u0394H-\u0394G)/T</p>TABLE 8 thermodynamically relevant parameters for DTNB and DOX systems at different temperatures</p></p>As can be seen from Table 8, \u0394 G &lt;0, indicating that binding of DOX to the molecular valve occurs spontaneously during the reaction, and \u0394 S &gt;0, indicating that the entropy-increasing process favors the spontaneous progression of the binding reaction. \u0394 H &gt;0, indicating that the reaction is endothermic, and the temperature increase favors the binding of DOX to the valve molecules, consistent with the previous conclusions.
