(2002)1-10 (all incorporated herein by reference in their entirety).</p>The term \"amino acid deletion\" denotes the removal of at least one amino acid residue at a predetermined position in an amino acid sequence.</p>The term \"ANG-2\" as used herein denotes human angiopoietin-2 (ANG-2) (alternatively abbreviated as ANGPT2 or ANG2) (SEQ ID NO: 31) which is described, for example, in Maison pierre, P.C., et al, Science 277(1997)55-60 and Cheung, A.H., et al, Genomics 48(1998) 389-91. Angiopoietins-1 (SEQ ID NO: 32) and-2 were found to act as ligands for Ties, a family of tyrosine kinases that are selectively expressed in vascular endothelium (Yancopoulos, G.D., et al, Nature 407(2000)242- &gt; 248). There are now four defined members of the angiogenin family. Angiopoietins-3 and-4 (ANG-3 and ANG-4) may represent widely spread counterparts of the same locus in mice and humans (Kim, I., et al, FEBS Let, 443(1999) 353-356; Kim, I., et al, J.biol.chem.274(1999) 26523-26528). ANG-1 and ANG-2 were initially identified as agonists and antagonists, respectively, in tissue culture experiments (for ANG-1 see: Davis, S., et al, Cell 87(1996) 1161-. All known angiopoietins bind predominantly Tie2(SEQ ID NO: 33), and both ANG-1 and-2 bind Tie2 with an affinity of 3nM (Kd) (Maison Pierre, P.C., et al, Science 277(1997) 55-60).</p>The term \"antibody\" is used herein in the broadest sense and includes a variety of antibody structures, including, but not limited to, monoclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies, trispecific antibodies), and antibody fragments, so long as they exhibit the desired antigen-and/or protein a and/or FcRn-binding activity.</p>The term \"asymmetric Fc region\" denotes a pair of Fc region polypeptides having different amino acid residues at corresponding positions according to the Kabat EU index numbering system.</p>The term \"Fc region asymmetric with respect to FcRn binding\" denotes an Fc region consisting of two polypeptide chains having different amino acid residues at corresponding positions, wherein said positions are determined according to the Kabat EU index numbering system, wherein said different positions influence the binding of the Fc region to a human neonatal Fc-receptor (FcRn). For the purposes herein, the difference between two polypeptide chains of an Fc region in an \"Fc region asymmetric with respect to FcRn binding\" does not include the differences that have been introduced to promote the formation of heterodimeric Fc regions (e.g., for the production of bispecific antibodies). These differences may also be asymmetric, i.e. the two chains differ at non-corresponding amino acid residues according to the Kabat EU index numbering system. These differences promote heterodimeri",
    "54C in the other chain; T394C in one chain and E397C in the other; or D399C in one strand and K392C in the other strand. Other examples of heterodimerization that promote amino acid changes are the so-called \"charge pair substitutions\" (see, e.g., WO 2009/089004). It has been found that the following charge pair substitutions in the individual polypeptide chains of the Fc region of an IgG antibody of subclass IgG1 increase heterodimer formation: 1) K409D or K409E in one strand and D399K or D399R in the other strand; 2) K392D or K392E in one strand and D399K or D399R in the other strand; 3) K439D or K439E in one chain and E356K or E356R in the other chain; 4) K370D or K370E in one chain and E357K or E357R in the other chain; 5) K409D and K360D in one strand plus D399K and E356K in the other strand; 6) K409D and K370D in one strand plus D399K and E357K in the other strand; 7) K409D and K392D in one chain plus D399K, E356K and E357K in the other chain; 8) K409D and K392D in one strand and D399K in the other strand; 9) K409D and K392D in one chain and D399K and E356K in the other; 10) K409D and K392D in one chain and D399K and D357K in the other; 11) K409D and K370D in one chain and D399K and D357K in the other; 12) D399K in one strand and K409D and K360D in the other strand; and 13) K409D and K439D in one chain and D399K and E356K in the other chain.</p>The term \"binding (antigen)\" refers to the binding of an antibody to its antigen in an in vitro assay, in one embodiment, in a binding assay, an antibody is bound to a surface and the binding of antigen to the antibody is measured by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR).

Decoration</p>In another aspect, a dimeric polypeptide according to any of the above embodiments may comprise any of the features as described in sections 1-6 below, alone or in combination:</p>1. affinity of antibody</p>In one embodiment, use is made ofSurface plasmon resonance assay measures Kd. For example, use-2000 orAssay of-3000 (GE Healthcare inc., Piscataway, NJ) was performed at 25 \u2103 with an immobilized binding partner CM5 chip at about 10 Response Units (RU). In one embodiment, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, GE Healthcare Inc.) are activated with N-ethyl-N '- (3-dimethylaminopropyl) -carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. The binding partner was diluted to 5 \u03bc g/mL (. about.0.2 \u03bc M) with 10mM sodium acetate (pH 4.8) and subsequently injected at a flow rate of 5 \u03bc l/min to achieve approximately 10 Response Units (RU) of conjugated binding partner. After injection of the binding partner, 1M ethanolamine was injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetic measurements, two-fold serial dilutions (0.78nM to 500nM) of dimeric polypeptide containing fusion polypeptide or antibody were injected at 25 \u2103 at a flow rate of about 25 \u03bc L/min with 0.05% polysorbate 20(TWEEN-20<sup>TM</sup>) Surfactant in pbs (pbst). Using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model: (Evaluation software version 3.2), the binding rate (k) was calculated by simultaneous fitting of the binding and dissociation sensorgrams (sensorgram)<sub>on</sub>) And dissociation rate (k)<sub>off</sub>). The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated as the ratio k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>(see, e.g., Chen, Y. et al, J.Mol.biol.293(1999) 865-. If the binding rate exceeds 10 as determined by the above surface plasmon resonance measurement<sup>6</sup>M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>The binding rate can then be determined using a fluorescence quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation 295 nM; emission 340nM, 16nM bandpass) of 20nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS (pH 7.2) at 25 \u2103 in the presence of increasing antigen concentrations at a spectrometer such as an aviv instruments equipped with a stop-flow valve (stop-flow) or a 8000-series SLM-AMINCO with a stirred cuvette<sup>TM</sup>Measured in a spectrophotometer (thermospectonic).</p>2. Chimeric and humanized antibodies</p>In certain embodiments, the dimeric polypeptide as reported herein is a chimeric antibody. Certain chimeric antibodies are described, for example, in US 4,816,567; and Morrison, S.L., et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81(1984) 6851-6855). In one embodiment, the chimeric antibody comprises a non-human variable region (e.g., a variable region derived from a mouse, rat, hamster, rabbit, or non-human primate, such as a monkey) and a human constant region. In another embodiment, the chimeric antibody is a \"class-switched\" antibody, wherein the class or subclass has been altered relative to the parent antibody. Chimeric antibodies include antigen-binding fragments thereof.</",
    "content between the stored sample and the sample measured immediately after preparation is reported as \"increased HMW\" and \"increased LMW\", respectively. The results, shown in the table below and in FIG. 4, indicate that VEGF/ANG2-0015 (without IHH-AAA mutation) shows a higher decrease in the major peak and a higher increase in HMW as compared to VEGF/ANG2-0016 (with IHH-AAA mutation). Surprisingly, VEGF/ANG2-0016 (with IHH-AAA mutation) showed a lower tendency to aggregate compared to VEGF/ANG2-0015 (without IHH-AAA mutation).</p>Table: changes in major peak, HMW peak and LMW peak after 7 days of storage at 40 \u2103</p></p>At 25 deg.COr T200 instrument (GE Healthcare), to evaluate the functional analysis of the anti-VEGF/ANG 2 bispecific antibody by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR).Systems are well established for studying molecular interactions. SPR-technology is based on measuring the refractive index near the surface of a gold-coated biosensor chip. The change in refractive index is indicative of a mass change on the surface caused by interaction of the immobilized ligand with the injected analyte in solution. Mass increases if the molecule binds to the immobilized ligand on the surface and vice versa, and decreases in the case of dissociation of the analyte from the immobilized ligand (reflecting complex dissociation). SPR allows continuous real-time monitoring of ligand/analyte binding and thus determination of the association rate constant (ka), dissociation rate constant (KD) and equilibrium constant (KD).</p>Example 3</p>Binding to VEGF, ANG2, Fc \u03b3 R and FcRn</p>VEGF allotrope dynamicsStudying relativesAndforce, including assessment of species cross-reactivity</p>A capture system of about 12,000 Resonance Units (RU) (10. mu.g/mL goat anti-human F (ab) 'was coupled on a CM5 chip (GE Healthcare BR-1005-30) at pH5.0 by using the amine coupling kit supplied by GE Healthcare'<sub>2</sub>(ii) a An order code: 28958325, respectively; GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB, Sweden). The sample and system buffer was PBS-T (10mM phosphate buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20) pH 7.4. Flow cell was set to 25 \u2103 -and sample block to 12 \u2103 -and primed 2 times with running buffer. Bispecific antibody was captured by injecting 50nM solution at a flow rate of 5 \u03bc L/min for 30 seconds. Binding was measured by injecting different concentrations (300nM starting at a 1: 3 dilution) of human hVEGF121, mouse mVEGF120, or rat rVEGF164 in solution at a flow rate of 30. mu.L/min for 300 seconds. The dissociation phase was monitored for 1200 seconds and triggered by switching from the sample solution to running buffer. The surface was regenerated by washing with glycine pH 2.1 solution at a flow rate of 30 \u03bc L/min for 60 seconds.

The flow cell was set to 25 \u2103 and the sample block was set to 12 \u2103 and primed 2 times with running buffer. The sample and system buffer was PBS-T (10mM phosphate buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20) pH 6.0. To evaluate different IgG concentrations for each antibody, concentrations of 62.5nM, 125nM, 250nM, and 500nM were prepared. The flow rate was set to 30 \u03bc L/min and different samples were injected onto the chip surface consecutively with a binding time of 180 seconds selected. The surface was regenerated by injecting PBS-T pH 8 at a flow rate of 30. mu.L/min for 60 seconds. The bulk refractive index difference was corrected by subtracting the response obtained from the blank surface. Buffer injection (double reference) was also subtracted. To calculate the steady-state affinity, the method from BIA-evaluation software was used. Briefly, RU values were plotted against the concentration analyzed to generate a dose-response curve. Based on a 2-parameter fit, an asymptote is calculated, allowing the determination of the half-maximal RU value and thus the affinity. The results are shown in figure 5 and the table below. Similarly, affinity for cynomolgus monkey, mouse and rabbit FcRn can be determined.</p>Fc \u03b3 RIIIa measurement</p>For Fc \u03b3 RIIIa measurements, a direct binding assay was used. A capture system (1. mu.g/mL Penta-His; Qiagen) of approximately 3,000 Resonance Units (RU) was coupled on a CM5 chip (GE Healthcare BR-1005-30) at pH5.0 by using the amine coupling kit supplied by GE Healthcare. The sample and system buffer was HBS-P + pH 7.4. Flow cell was set to 25 \u2103 -and sample block to 12 \u2103 -and primed 2 times with running buffer. The Fc \u03b3 RIIIa-His-receptor was captured by injecting 100nM solution at a flow rate of 5 \u03bc L/min for 60 seconds. Binding was measured by injecting 100nM bispecific antibody or monospecific control antibody (anti-digoxigenin antibody for the IgG1 subclass and IgG4 subclass antibodies) at a flow rate of 30 \u03bc L/min for 180 seconds. The surface was regenerated by washing with glycine pH 2.5 solution at a flow rate of 30. mu.L/min for 120 seconds. Since Fc \u03b3 RIIIa binding was different from the Langmuir 1: 1 model, binding/non-binding was determined only with this assay. In a similar manner, Fc \u03b3 RIa binding and Fc \u03b3 RIIa binding can be determined. The results are shown in figure 6, where subsequently no further binding to Fc \u03b3 RIIIa could be detected by introducing the mutation P329 GLALA.</p>Evaluation of independent VEGFAndbinding of ANG2 to anti-VEGF/ANG 2 antibodies</p>A capture system of about 3,500 Resonance Units (RU) (10. mu.g/mL goat anti-human IgG; GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB, Sweden) was coupled on a CM4 chip (GE Healthcare BR-1005-34) at pH5.0 by using the amine coupling kit supplied by GE Heal"
