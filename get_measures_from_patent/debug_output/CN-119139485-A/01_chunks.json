    "M:</p> Into a centrifuge tube, an aqueous solution (1 equivalent) of 3-terminal mercapto-modified PTK7 aptamer, an auristatin-type tubulin inhibitor Mc-MMAE (CAS: 863971-24-8, available from Shanghai Haiyuan Biometrics Co., ltd.) containing acetonitrile/water (1/5-3/1, preferably 1/2) (2-30 equivalent, preferably 3 equivalent) with maleimide caproamide protecting group was added, and the temperature was kept at 4-40 \u2103, preferably 25 \u2103, and the reaction was stirred for 2-24 hours, preferably 12 hours. Purifying by reverse phase preparation column, lyophilizing to obtain PTK7 aptamer coupled drug S-M (Sgc c-Mc-MMAE) with 3' end coupled with Mc-MMAE, desalting, and lyophilizing. S-M Calculated: 13741.1 (Found: 13741). </p>EXAMPLE 19 Effect of 3-terminal coupling of different linkers on construction of aptamer-conjugated drugs</p>This example was constructed using the method provided in example 1, wherein the linker on MMAE was a cleavable maleimide VC linker SM, a non-cleavable maleimide caproyl linker S-M, wherein the method of construction VcMMAE was example 1, the method of construction of a non-cleavable maleimide caproyl linker S-M was example 18, and the inhibitory effect of different linker drugs SM, S-M on human pancreatic cancer MIA PaCa-2 cells was examined according to the method provided in example 16. The results show that the PTK7 aptamer conjugate drug SM constructed by adopting the Vc linker is significantly superior to the non-cleavable linker drug S-M, and the IC50 is reduced by more than 30%, probably because the non-cleavable linker limits the activity of the MMAE drug, so the most preferred linker is the Vc linker.</p>EXAMPLE 20 preparation of PTK7 targeting aptamer 3-terminal coupled drug SE</p>In this example, a PTK7 (sgc 8c, published sequence) aptamer-coupled drug SE was prepared with a 3-terminal-coupled MC-VA-PAB-Exatecan drug. SE is synthesized by adopting a sulfhydryl maleimide chemical reaction, and the reaction formula is as follows:</p></p> wherein, the ribbon with mercapto is aptamer, DMTr is dimethoxy trityl protecting group. </p>The preparation process is as follows:</p> (1) The procedure for the preparation of aqueous solutions of thiol-modified PTK7 nucleic acid aptamers is shown in example 1. </p>(2) Preparation of aptamer-coupled drug SE:</p> A3-terminal mercapto-modified PTK7 aptamer aqueous solution (1 eq.) was added to the centrifuge tube, and the DNA topoisomerase I (topoisomerase I) inhibitor with MC-VA-PAB linker, irinotecan MC-VA-PAB-Exatecan (CAS: 2680543-57-9, available from Shanghai Haifeng biological medicine technologies Co., ltd.) was mixed with a DMSO/water (1/5-3/1, preferably 1/1) solution (2-30 eq., preferably 3 eq.) at a temperature of 4-40 \u2103, preferably 25 \u2103, and stirred for 2-24 hours, preferably 12 hours. Purifying by reverse phase preparation column, lyophilizing to obtain PTK7 aptamer conjugate medicine SE (Sgc 8 c-EXA) with 3' -end coupled Exatecan, desalting, and lyophilizing. Mass spec"
