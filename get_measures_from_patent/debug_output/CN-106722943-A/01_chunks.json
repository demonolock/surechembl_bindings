    "eveloper, and its metabolite to yeast occurs color reaction, leads to\nThe size that it may determine that breathing enzyme activity in saccharomycete is crossed, i.e. saccharomycete produces the height of alcohol ability.On solid medium\nDifferent colours can be shown after one layer of TTC developer is covered on different yeast colonies, it is in peony to produce the strong yeast colony of alcohol ability,\nIt is pink to take second place.Fermentation is tested with metabolism of yeasts product and TTC developers generation chromogenic reaction to be produced with Pichia yeast\nAlcohol ability is strong and weak, and the chromogenic reaction of fermentation Pichia yeast, other saccharomycete and TTC is determined respectively.</p>Picking fermentation Pichia yeast and other saccharomycete are distinguished in potato dextrose agar with sterilized toothpick\nOn culture medium, fermentation Pichia yeast black marking pen in culture dish bottom marker, after 30 DEG C of culture 36h, in culture medium\nOn cover one layer of TTC upper stratas culture medium again, lucifuge stands half a day.Experimental result is evident that fermentation Pichia yeast in white\nColor, other saccharomycete are in peony, pink colour, are indicated above Pichia pastoris subspecies usedPichia kudriavzevii\nIt is low that PKD3001 produces alcohol amount.</p>Effect example 3</p>Using DPPH methods<sup>[2]</sup>Embodiment 1,2,3,4 is determined respectively by adding Pichia pastoris subspeciesPichia kudriavzevii\nPKD 3001 fermented obtained by apple ferment as obtained by the method for spontaneous fermentation of apple ferment sample and comparative examples 1\nThe antioxidation activity of sample, i.e., with 1,1- diphenyl -2- trinitrophenyl-hydrazines\uff08DPPH\uff09Removing vigor is detected that it is walked for index\nIt is rapid as follows\uff1a</p>In 5 test tubes of 10 mL, the apple ferment sample and comparative examples of the gained of 2mL embodiments 1,2,3,4 are separately added into\nThe apple ferment sample of 1 gained, is then separately added into 2mL 0.1mmol/L DPPH solution in each test tube, shake up, respectively\nDark place stands 30min at room temperature, with absolute ethyl alcohol as blank, absorbance of the sample under 517nm in each test tube is determined respectively,\nIt is denoted asA<sub>sample</sub>.2mL DPPH solution and the mixed absorbance of 2mL ethanol are determined simultaneously, are denoted asA<sub>control</sub>, and 2mL hairs\nBright sample solution and the mixed absorbance of 2mL absolute ethyl alcoholsA<sub>blank</sub>.Then the apple ferment of the gained of embodiment 1,2,3,4 is calculated\nThe radical scavenging activity of the apple ferment sample of sample and the gained of comparative examples 1, i.e. clearance rate, each sample parallel determination\n3 times, its computational methods is as follows\uff1a</p></p>Clearance rate shows that more greatly the Scavenging activity of free radical is stronger, is indicated above its oxidation resistance stronger.</p>The ab"
