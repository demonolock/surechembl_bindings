In the assay, ATP is converted to ADP by the test kinase in the presence of substrate. The assay reagents then convert the remaining ADP to ATP and result in a luciferase reaction and luminescent readout proportional to the relative kinase activity.

The inhibition potency of Compound 1 on Rapidly Accelerated Fibrosarcoma (RAF) kinases were profiled in both the adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-Glo screening assay as well as radiometric kinase assays. Compound 1 was demonstrated to be a potent inhibitor of the RAF1, BRAF, ARAF kinases, with IC<sub>50 </sub>values &lt;5 nM. Non-RAF kinome selectivity was evaluated in the kinase panel as measured by mobility shift assay and revealed that only DDR1 and DDR2 were inhibited \u226540% at 1 \u03bcM. Taken together, Compound 1 is a potent, selective RAF inhibitor with minimal activity towards the rest of the kinome.</p>Example 2: Compound 1 Inhibits Cell Proliferation in Cell CultureCompound 1 is a selective and potent inhibitor of RAF kinases designed to target Class II and III BRAF mutations, in addition to Class I BRAF mutations.

    "ompound 1 in Class I BRAF-Mutant Human CancerThe antitumor activity of Compound 1 was first evaluated in the human A-375 melanoma xenograft model harboring a Class I BRAF V600E mutation. Treatment with Compound 1 (15, 30, or 60 mg/kg; free base form) was initiated when tumor volumes reached approximately 200 mm<sup>3 </sup>and was continued once daily (QD) for 3 weeks. Mean A-375 xenograft tumor volumes (FIG. 1A), mouse body weight (FIG. 1B), and percent change in xenograft tumor volumes at end of study relative to baseline (FIG. 1C) following treatment with Compound 1 are presented by dose cohort. Compound 1 treatment was initiated when tumor volumes reached an average of \u02dc205 mm<sup>3 </sup>and continued for 21 days at indicated doses (n=9 animals per group). Mean tumor volumes and body weights are plotted, respectively; error bars denote standard error of mean. Percent change in tumor volume was calculated using the following formula: (TVf\u2212TV0)/TV0\u00d7100%; where TVf=final tumor volume (at end of treatment) and TV0=initial tumor volume (at beginning of treatment).</p>TABLE 5DoseGroupNo.(mg/VolumeRegi-Dura-No.DrugAnimalskg)(\u03bcL/g)Routemention1Vehicle9\u2002010POQD21 days3Compound 191510POQD21 days4Compound 193010POQD21 days5Compound 196010POQD21 days</p>Compound 1 treatment resulted in systemic plasma exposures (AUClast) of 11,900-156,000 h*ng/mL when dosed orally over a 24-hour period following the last dose in mice bearing mutant A-375 BRAF Class I melanoma tumors. Dose-dependent inhibition of xenograft tumor growth relative to control (vehicle-treated) tumors was observed with Compound 1 treatment (FIG. 1A). All of the tested doses were well tolerated with some weight loss observed in animals treated with 60 mg/kg (average weight loss of 5.6%; FIG. 1B).

The lowest tested dose, 15 mg/kg, did not lead to significant TGI.</p>B. Evaluation of Antitumor Activity of Compound 1 in Class BRAF-Mutant Human CancersThe antitumor activity of Compound 1 was next evaluated in human xenograft models exhibiting Class II/III BRAF mutations. BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer and WM3629 melanoma cell-line derived xenografts harboring a Class II BRAF insertion-deletion (indel; V487_P492delinsA) and Class III BRAF D594G mutation, respectively, were treated with a total of 3-20 mg/kg daily of Compound 1 (sulfate salt form) for 2 weeks. Treatment was initiated when tumor volumes were \u02dc240-280 mm<sup>3 </sup>with animals receiving a range of equivalent total doses administered once (QD; 3-20 mg/kg) or twice (BID; 1.5-10 mg/kg) daily. Mean BxPC-3 (Class II BRAF mutant PDAC) and WM3629 (Class III BRAF mutant melanoma) xenograft tumor volumes (FIG. 2A, FIG. 2C) and mouse body weight (FIG. 2B, FIG. 2D) during treatment with Compound 1 are presented by dose cohort. Compound 1 treatment was initiated when tumor volumes reached an average of 240-283 mm<sup>3 </sup>and continued for 14 days at indicated doses and frequencies (n=9 animals per group).

Dose-dependent inhibition of BxPC-3 and WM3629 xenograft tumor growth relative to control (vehicle-treated) tumors was observed with Compound 1 treatment (FIG. 2A, FIG. 2C). A trend towards greater TGI was achieved with BID, compared to QD, administration of equivalent total daily doses of Compound 1 in both models. All tested doses and schedules were well tolerated as measured by on-treatment animal body weight changes (FIG. 2B, FIG. 2D).</p>Waterfall plots of individual BxPC-3 tumor and WM3629 tumor xenograft responses are presented in FIG. 3A and FIG. 3B, respectively. Statistically significant reductions in BxPC-3 tumor growth were achieved at all tested doses up to 10 mg/kg total Compound 1 per day (51-88% inhibition; p\u22640.0001; FIG. 3A). Additionally, tumor regressions were observed among animals in the 20 mg/kg QD and 3-10 mg/kg BID treatment groups (109% and 118% TGI at 20 mg/kg QD and 10 mg/kg BID, respectively; p 0.0001). Similarly, TGI was observed with all tested doses and schedules in the WM3629 model (47-101% inhibition; p 0.04-0.0001); with some cases of regression observed at the highest daily doses (FIG. 3B). Consistent with the BxPC-3 model, a regression was also achieved in one animal at a lower dose (5 mg/kg) when administered BID.</p>C.

A dose-dependent response to Compound 1 monotherapy was observed (FIG. 4A, C). The average TGI was 86% and 99% with 15 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg, respectively. Treatment with binimetinib (10 mg/kg QD) as a single agent did not lead to significant inhibition of tumor growth. The addition of Compound 1 to binimetinib did, however, result in improved tumor xenograft growth inhibition with evidence of tumor regression (101% and 108% TGI with 10/15 mg/kg and 10/30 mg/kg binimetinib/Compound 1, respectively; p 0.0001; FIG. 4C). Importantly, treatment with Compound 1 plus binimetinib was well-tolerated, with only one animal at the highest combination therapy dose exhibiting 10% body weight loss at a single on-treatment time point (FIG. 4B).</p>ConclusionsCompound 1 was well-tolerated and efficacious in athymic nude mouse xenograft models of BRAF-mutant human cancers at doses up to 60 mg/kg per day. Dose-dependent inhibition of A-375 (BRAF Class I mutation), BxPC-3 (BRAF Class II mutation), or WM3629 (BRAF Class III mutation) xenograft tumor growth was observed with daily Compound 1 treatment. A trend towards more robust tumor responses was observed with twice daily compared to once daily dosing of Compound 1, however, the two dosing regimens led to similar tumor growth inhibition (TGI) and regressions (mean TGI up to 101-118%; p 0.0001) at equivalent total daily doses. Compound 1 was also well-tolerated and efficacious when combined with a MEK inhibitor leading to WM3629 xenograft tumor regressions (mean TGI 101-106%; p 0.0001). These data indicate that Compound 1 has potent antitumor activity as a single agent and may also be safely combined with other targeted therapies for the treatment of BRAF-driven cancers.</p>Example 4: Evaluation of Cellular Activity of Compound 1 in Combination with Binimetinib in NRAS Mutant MelanomaPurpose: To evaluate the cellular potency and activity of Compound 1, a selective and potent inhibitor of rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF) kinases, in combination with a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor, binimetinib.</p>Methods: Combinatorial activity of the RAF inhibitor Compound 1 plus binimetinib was evaluated in human neuroblastoma rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (NRAS) mutant melanoma cells in a 7-day growth assay.

The multi-dimensional synergy of combinations (MuSyC) model takes into account both potency (alpha) and efficacy (beta) in its model; scores &gt;0 indicate synergy between the two drugs in the indicated parameter. Highest single agent (HSA), Bliss, and Loewe synergy models were assessed and utilized to find the most synergistic area score, where scores &gt;10 indicate that the interaction between the two drugs is likely to be synergistic. The results from the 7-day growth assay were analyzed using multiple synergy models, see Table 9. The MuSyC model resulted in a beta score of 0.44 and an alpha score of 10.61, indicating both synergistic combination efficacy and synergistic potency in the SK-MEL-2 study. HSA, Bliss, and Loewe models calculated most synergistic area scores corresponding to 21.6, 16.2, and 11.6, respectively, indicating synergy in the ranges shown in Table 9.

All animals in a given study arm were euthanized when the group average TV reached &gt;2,500 mm<sup>3</sup>. Plasma and tumor tissue samples were collected for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis.</p>Results: The antitumor activity of compound 1 was evaluated in the human NCI-H2405 (Class II BRAF mutant) NSCLC xenograft model. Treatment with compound 1 (1.5, 3, 10, or 15 mg/kg twice daily [BID]) was initiated when TVs reached approximately 300 mm<sup>3 </sup>(actual mean TV for all groups was 304 mm<sup>3</sup>) and was continued BID for 3 weeks.</p>Dose-dependent exposures and antitumor responses to compound 1 treatment were observed. AUC<sub>0-24 </sub>values ranging from 2878-50799 hr*ng/mL were achieved at the tested doses, and tumor growth inhibition (TGI) relative to controls (vehicle-treated animals) was observed (FIG. 9A, FIG. 9C). The average TGI with increasing doses of 1.5, 3, 10, or 15 mg/kg BID was 42%, 58%, 85%, and 107%, respectively (Table 14). Statistically significant reductions in tumor growth were achieved at the 1.5, 3, 10, and 15 mg/kg BID doses of compound 1 (p&lt;0.0001 for all comparisons; Table 14). Importantly, treatment with compound 1 was well-tolerated at all tested doses, with no groups exhibiting \u226510% body weight loss during the study (FIG. 9B).</p>TABLE 14Baseline TumorFinal TumorTreatmentVolume (mm<sup>3</sup>)<sup>a</sup>Volume (mm<sup>3</sup>)\u00aa\u0394T/\u0394C (%)<sup>b</sup>TGI (%)<sup>c</sup>P-value<sup>d</sup>Vehicle304 \u00b1 311333 \u00b1 199\u2002\u2014\u2014\u20141.5 mg/kg BID compound 1304 \u00b1 35902 \u00b1 1055842&lt;0.0001*3 mg/kg BID compound 1304 \u00b1 32741 \u00b1 98\u20024258&lt;0.0001*10 mg/kg BID compound 1304 \u00b1 34463 \u00b1 53\u20021585&lt;0.0001*15 mg/kg BID compound 1304 \u00b1 33230 \u00b1 20\u2002\u22127107&lt;0.0001*ANOVA = analysis of varianceC = control;RM = repeated measures;SEM = standard error of the mean;T = treated;TGI = tumor growth inhibition;TV = tumor volume\u00aaMean \u00b1 SEM.<sup>b</sup>\u0394T/\u0394C = 100% \u00d7 (TV<sub>f </sub>\u2212 TV<sub>0</sub>)<sub>treated</sub>/(TV<sub>f </sub>\u2212 TV<sub>0</sub>)<sub>control </sub>where TV<sub>f </sub>= final TV (at end of treatment) and TV<sub>0 </sub>= initial TV (at beginning of treatment).<sup>c</sup>TGI = (1-T/C) \u00d7 100%.<sup>d</sup>P-value for the comparison of TGI in the respective treatment group vs. TGI in vehicle-treated animals, as determined by two-way RM ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc comparison of the means.*P-values indicate statistically significant difference.</p>Summary of Results: Compound 1 (1.5 to 15 mg/kg BID) was well-tolerated and efficacious when dosed orally for 21 days in the BRAF mutant NSCLC xenograft model, NCI-H2405. Dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was observed with twice daily (BID) compound 1 treatment, with low dose compound 1 (1.5-3.0 mg/kg BID) leading to moderate TGI (mean 42-58%) and higher compound 1 doses (10-15 mg/kg BID) to strong TGI (mean 85-107%). TGI in all compound 1-treated groups differed statistically significantly from vehicle-treated animals (p&lt;0.0001). These data indicate that compound 1 may be safely and effectively used for potent antitumor benefit in BRAF mutant NSCLC.</p>Example 8: Use of Compound 1 in a Human Clinical TrialTitle: A Phase 1/1b Open-Label, Multicenter Study to Investigate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Antitumor Activity of compound 1 in Participants with BRAF and/or NRAS Mutation-positive Solid Tumors</p>Study Phase: Phase 1/1b</p>Indication: BRAF Mutation Positive Solid Tumors and/or NRAS mutation-positive solid tumors</p>Introduction: This is a 2-part, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation and dose expansion study in participants with rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma, homolog B (BRAF) mutation-positive and/or neuroblastoma RAS (NRAS) mutation-positive tumors designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of compound 1, a pan-rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF) small molecule kinase inhibitor; to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of compound 1 for further clinical development; and to assess the objective response to compound 1 therapy alone and in combination with binimetinib, a mitogen-activated pr",
