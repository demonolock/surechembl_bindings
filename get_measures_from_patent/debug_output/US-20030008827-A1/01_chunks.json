    "tide is conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanine (KLH; 1 mg peptide to 10 mg KLH). The KLH conjugate (LMG) is suspended in complete Freund's adjuvant and injected into rabbits at time 0, and boosted with 0.25 mg KLH conjugate at 4 weeks and again at 5 weeks. Pre-bleeds and six week post-bleeds are tested for antibody titer against authentic antigen by ELISA. </p>[0414] The production bleeds are pooled from 2 rabbits each. Antibodies directed exclusively against the peptide antigens are isolated as follows: </p>[0415] 1. Free peptide is attached to cyanogen bromide activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer's protocol. </p>[0416] 2. The antisera is preabsorbed on a column of irrelevant peptides and on columns of irrelevant human and mouse serum proteins. </p>[0417] 3. The pre-absorbed antisera is passed through the corresponding peptide column (see point 1). </p>[0418] 4. The columns are washed with 0.1 M borate buffered saline (pH 8.2) and the bound antibodies are eluted using a low pH gradient step from pH 4.0 to pH 3.0 to pH 2.0 (0.1 M glycine buffer) and finally with 0.1 M HCl. </p>[0419] 5. The eluted material is neutralized with excess borate saline, concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon, YM30) and dialyzed against borate saline. </p>[0420] 6. The protein concentration is determined by absorbance at 280 nm. </p>[0421] The resulting antibodies are tested for species specificity using purified human ApoA-I or purified mouse ApoA-I in a direct ELISA binding assay. </p>[0422] The invention is not to be limited in scope by the specific embodiments described which are intended as single illustrations of individual aspects of the invention, and functionally equivalent methods and components are within the scope of the invention. Indeed various modifications of the invention, in addition to those shown and described herein will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing description and accompanying drawings. Such modifications are intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims. </p>[0423] All references cited herein are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.  \n</p>0                               SEQUENCE LISTING   (1) GENERAL INFORMATION:     (iii) NUMBER OF SEQUENCES: 258   (2) INFORMATION FOR SEQ ID NO: 1:       (i) SEQUENCE CHARACTERISTICS:           (A) LENGTH: 22 amino acids           (B) TYPE: amino acid           (C) STRANDEDNESS: single           (D) TOPOLOGY: linear      (ii) MOLECULE TYPE: None      (ix) FEATURE:           (A) NAME/KEY: Other           (B) LOCATION: 16           (D) OTHER INFORMATION: Xaa = Naphthylalanine      (xi) SEQUENCE DESCRIPTION: SEQ ID NO: 1:  Pro Val Leu Asp Leu Phe Arg Glu Leu Leu Asn Glu Leu Leu Glu Xaa  1               5                  10                  15  Leu Lys Gln Lys Leu Lys             20   (2) INFORMATION FOR SEQ ID NO: 2:       (i) SEQUENCE CHARACTERISTICS:           (A) LENGTH: 23 amino acids           (B) TYPE: amino acid         "
