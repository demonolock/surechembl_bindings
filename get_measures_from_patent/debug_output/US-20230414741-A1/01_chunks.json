    "s inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of individuals.</p>Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compounds that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. Although compounds that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such compounds to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects.</p>The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the EC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal response) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.</p>The pharmaceutical compositions can be included in a container, pack, or dispenser together with optional instructions for administration.</p>The route of delivery can be dependent on the disorder of the patient. In certain exemplary embodiments, a subject diagnosed with skin cancer can be administered an HPV vaccine composition of the invention by topical administration. In addition to an HPV vaccine composition of the invention, a patient can be administered a second therapy, e.g., a palliative therapy and/or disease-specific therapy. The secondary therapy can be, for example, symptomatic (e.g., for alleviating symptoms), protective (e.g., for slowing or halting disease progression), or restorative (e.g., for reversing the disease process). For the treatment of cancer, for example, symptomatic therapies can further include another chemotherapeutic agent used as a combination therapy as described further herein.</p>In general, an HPV vaccine composition of the invention can be administered by any suitable method. As used herein, topical delivery can refer to the direct application of an HPV vaccine composition to any surface of the body, including the eye, a mucous membrane, surfaces"
