    "L, Phenyl Methyl Sulphonyl Fluoride (PMSF) 0.1mM, Aprotinin 2\u00b5g/mL and Pepstatin 2\u00b5M (or a 1/50 dilution of a mix of protease inhibitors). The obtained suspension is stirred gently and submitted to a 25-26xg mechanic pressure exerted through a syringe. The cell lysate is then centrifuged at 300g 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C in order to eliminate nucleus and cell scraps. The obtained supernatant is then centrifuged at 48000 g for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C. The final pellet is resuspended in buffer I with a potter homogenizer. Aliquots are frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored until use at -80\u00b0C. Protein content is measured by the Bradford method.</p>\u25cf GTPy [<sup>35</sup>S] bindingDefreezed membranes are diluted at a final concentration of 5\u00b5g/180\u00b5L/well in buffer I supplemented by GDP 10\u00b5M and distributed in 96 well polystyrene microplate. GTPy [<sup>35</sup>S] labelled ligand (0.2-0.3 nM) is added for additional 30 minutes. After transfer in a Millipore GF/C HTS<sup>\u00ae</sup> microplate, the filtration of the reactional mix is followed by a three times 250 \u00b5l wash to stop the reaction.</p>The filter-bound radioactivity is measured in a liquid scintillation counter Microbeta TRILUX<sup>\u00ae</sup> with 50\u00b5l of scintillation fluid.</p>GTPy [<sup>35</sup>S] dependent binding activity is determined in vitro for Histamine, Imetit, R(-)-alpha-methyl-histamine and all our compounds.</p>Compounds can also be tested against Histamine or Imetit to evaluate their antagonist potential.

Pellets were resuspended in buffer I Tris-HCl 50mM, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 10mM, NaCl 140mM, pH=7,4 supplemented by a 1/50 dilution of a mix of protease inhibitors. The obtained suspension is stirred gently and submitted to a 25-26xg mechanic pressure exerted through a syringe. The cell lysate is then centrifuged at 300g 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C in order to eliminate nucleus and cell scraps. The obtained supernatant was then centrifuged at 48000 g for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C.

[<sup>3</sup>H] Histamine labelled ligand (10-15 nM) is added for 60 minutes with compounds at room temperature under continuous stirring. Non specific binding was estimated in the presence of 10 \u00b5M BP1.2404 (JNJ 7777120). The reaction was terminated by filtration through GF/B filters pre-soaked 2 hours at 4 \u00b0C in 1 % polyethyleneimine. Filters were rinsed 3 times with 250 \u00b5l of ice cold incubation binding buffer.</p>The filter-bound radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter Microbeta TRILUX\u24c7 with 50\u00b5l of scintillation fluid.</p>The hH4 binding investigated by use of [<sup>3</sup>H] Histamine give a Bmax \u223c1 pmole/mg prot and a Kd \u223c9 nM.</p>Compounds described hereabove have been evaluated in the GTPy [<sup>35</sup>S] assay or in the [<sup>3</sup>H] histamine binding assay and have been found active with a Ki or IC50 under 1000nM.\nExKiIC501BB2CB3B4BB5BB6B7BB8B9B10BB11A12A13B14B15A16B17A18CB19B20B21B22C23C24C25C26B27A28AB29A30BB31BB32AA33BB34B35CB36CC37AA: Ki or IC50 &lt;1000nM\nB: Ki or IC50 &lt;300nM\nC: Ki or IC50 &lt;30nM</p>"
