    "longer effective. Additionally, administration of higher doses of morphine may lead to respiratory depression, causing the patient to stop breathing. Seeking alternative drugs to produce analgesia without development of tolerance or as an adjunct therapy to block tolerance without interference with analgesia is an active area of research. </p>Recent studies have suggested a modulatory role for the NMDA receptor in morphine tolerance. (Trujillo et al., Science 251:85-87 (1991); Marek et al., Brain Res. </p>547:77-81 (1991); Tiseo et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp Ther. 264:1090-1096 (1993); Lutfy et al., Brain Res. 616:83-88 (1993); Herman et al., Neuropsychopharmacology </p>12:269-294 (1995).) Further, it has been reported that NMDA receptor antagonists are useful for inhibiting opioid tolerance and some of the symptoms of opioid withdrawal. Thus, the present invention is also directed to the administration of the compounds </p>described herein to inhibit opiate tolerance and to treat or ameliorate the symptoms of opiate withdrawal by blocking the glycine co-agonist site associated with the NMDA receptor. </p>Thus, the present invention is directed to compounds having high affinity to a particular NMDA receptor subunit (subtype) and low affinity to other sites such as dopamine and other catecholamine receptors. </p>According to the present invention, those compounds having high binding to a particular NMDA subunit exhibit an IC<sub>50</sub> of about 100 \u03bcM or less in an NMDA subunit binding assay (see Table 1). Preferably, the compounds of the present invention exhibit a selective subunit IC<sub>50</sub> of 10 \u03bcM or less. More preferably, the \n\ncompounds of the present invention exhibit a selective subunit IC<sub>50</sub> of about 1.0 \u03bcM or less, more preferably about 0.1\u03bcM or less. Compositions within the scope of this invention include all compositions wherein the compounds of the present invention are contained in an amount which is effective to achieve its intended purpose. While individual needs vary, determination of optimal ranges of </p>effective amounts of each component is within the skill of the art. Typically, the compounds may be </p>administered to mammals, e.g. humans, orally at a dose of 0.0025 to 50 mg/kg, or an equivalent amount of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, per day of the body weight of the mammal being treated for anxiety disorders, e.g., generalized anxiety disorder, phobic disorders, obsessional compulsive disorder, panic disorder and post traumatic stress disorders or for schizophrenia or other psychoses. Preferably, about 0.01 to about 10 mg/kg is orally administered to treat or prevent such disorders. For intramuscular </p>injection, the dose is generally about one-half of the oral dose. For example, for treatment or prevention of anxiety, a suitable intramuscular dose would be about 0.0025 to about 15 mg/kg, and most preferably, from about 0.01 to about 10 mg/kg. </p>In the method of treatment or prevention of",

While oocytes were still </p>surrounded by enveloping ovarian tissues the Barth's medium was supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum. </p>Oocytes were defolliculated 1-2 days following </p>injections by treatment with collagenase (0.5 mg/ml Sigma Type I for 0.5-1 hr) (Miledi and Woodward, J . Physiol. (Lond.) 416:601-621 (1989)) and subsequently stored in serum-free medium. </p>Electrical recordings were made using a conventional two-electrode voltage clamp (Dagan TEV-200) over periods ranging between 3-21 days following injection. (Woodward et al., Mol. Pharmacol. 41: 89-103 (1992)). Oocytes were placed in a 0.1 ml recording chamber continuously perfused (5-15 ml min<sup>-1</sup>) with frog Ringer's solution containing (in mM):NaCl, 115; KCl, 2; CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.8; HEPES, 5; pH 7.4. Drugs were applied by bath perfusion. Using oocytes expressing different subunit combinations of NMDA receptor, NMDA currents were \n\nactivated by co-application of glutamate (100 \u03bcM) and glycine (1-100 \u03bcM). Inhibitory potency of the novel antagonists was assessed on responses elicited by fixed concentrations of glutamate and glycine, by measuring reductions in current induced by progressively </p>increasing concentrations of antagonist. </p>Concentration-inhibition curves were fit with </p>equation 1. I/I<sub>control</sub> = 1/(1+ ([antagonist]/10-<sup>pIC50</sup>)<sup>n</sup>) Eq. 1 in which I<sub>control</sub> is the current evoked by agonists alone, pIC<sub>50</sub> = -log IC<sub>50</sub>, IC<sub>50</sub> is the concentration of antagonist that produces half maximal inhibition, and n is the slope factor. (De Lean et al., Am. J. Physiol. </p> 235:E97-102 (1978)). For incomplete curves analysis by fitting was unreliable and IC<sub>50</sub> values were calculated by simple regression over linear portions of the curves (Origin: Microcal Software). </p>Maximal Electroshock- induced Seizures. Seizures were induced by application of current (50 mA, 60 </p>pulses/sec, 0.8 sec pulse width, 1 sec duration, d.c.) through saline-coated corneal electrodes using a Ugo Basile ECT device (Model 7801). Mice were restrained by gripping the loose skin on their dorsal surface, electrodes were held lightly against the two cornea, then current was applied and mice were observed for a period of up to 30 sec for the occurrence of a tonic hindlimb extensor response. A tonic seizure was defined as a hindlimb extension in excess of 90 degrees from the plane of the body. Results were treated in a quantal manner. The examples which follow are intended as an </p>illustration of certain preferred embodiments of the \n\ninvention, and no limitation of the invention is implied. </p>Example 1 </p> 1-(3-Butynyl)-4-(4-chlorobenzyl)piperidine </p><img id=\"imgf000058_0001\" path=\"imgf000058_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/175383314/"
