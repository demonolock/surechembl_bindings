    "s finished, the deproteinized protein is continuously washed by 10CV of washing column buffer until the UV 280 curve returns to the baseline level. The antibody was eluted with 5CV of elution buffer and the eluate was collected in a 1.5mL EP tube, 1 mL/tube volume. The eluted product was rapidly neutralized with 1M Tris-HCl. FIG. 3A shows the purification scheme of antibodies No. 8-3. After the elution was completed, the column was washed with 10CV of column washing buffer, and finally the Protein A purification column was preserved with 20% ethanol. The antibodies in the collection tubes located within the elution peak range were concentrated. The antibody was concentrated using a 30kDa molecular cut-off ultrafiltration tube and centrifuged at 10,000Xg for 5 min. Finally, PBS was added, and the mixture was centrifuged 3 times to replace the buffer with PBS. After the BCA method to determine protein concentration, SDS-PAGE electrophoresis was performed to determine the structural integrity and purity of the antibody (FIG. 3B).</p>EXAMPLE 4 determination of the affinity of antibodies No.8-3</p>The binding kinetics of No.8-3 antibody and PD-1 antigen were analyzed and determined by Fortibio Octet biomacromolecule interaction analyzer. The results of the analysis are shown in FIG. 4. As a result, it was found that the affinity of the antibody No.8-3 was higher than that of Keytruda (Table 1).</p>TABLE 1 determination of affinity constant of anti-PD-1 antibody</p>Sample\nKa(1/Ms)\nKd(1/s)\nK<sub>D</sub>(M)\nKeytruda\n9.97\u00d710<sup>5</sup>2.13\u00d710<sup>-3</sup>2.14\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>No.8-3\n2.16\u00d710<sup>4</sup>4.49\u00d710<sup>-7</sup>2.08\u00d710<sup>-11</sup></p>Example 5 flow cytometry detection of the binding Capacity of anti-PD-1 antibodies to PD-1 on the cell surface</p>Selecting PD-1 positive human acute leukemia mononuclear cells THP-1 at 1,000rpm, centrifuging for 5min, and collecting cell precipitates. Add 500. mu.L of FACS buffer to resuspend the cells and wash 2 times. 2-3 repeats of cell treatment are set for each group, and no treatment is carried out on a blank control group. FACS buffer diluted anti-PD-1 antibody was added and incubated on ice for 1 h. Add 500. mu.L of FACS buffer to resuspend the cells and wash 2 times. FACS buffer diluted FITC-labeled anti-human fluorescent secondary antibody (1: 500 dilution ratio) was added, incubated on ice for 1h in the absence of light, and washed 2 times with FACS buffer. Finally, the cells were resuspended in 500. mu.L PBS and filtered through a 300 mesh cell screen, and the mean fluorescence intensity of the cells and the percentage of positive cells were measured on a flow cytometer. As a result, it was found that both antibodies No.8-3 and Keytruda bind to cell surface PD-1, as shown in FIG. 5.</p>Example 6 flow cytometry detection of blocking Effect of anti-PD-1 antibodies on PD-1/PD-L1</p>Selecting positive THP-1 and U937 cells of PD-1, centrifuging at 1,000rpm for 5min, and collecting cell precipitate; add 500."
