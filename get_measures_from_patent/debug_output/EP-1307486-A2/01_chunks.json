    "equence have been disclosed by L. Rohrer et al. in Proc. Acad. Sci., 90, 4196-4200 (1993). hsst\u03b4 \n\nand its sequence have been described by R. Panetta et al. in Mol. Pharmacol. 45, 417-427, 1993.</p>\n  The binding assays may be carried out as disclosed hereunder using membranes from cell lines expressing selectively and stably hsstl , hsst2, hsst3, hsst4 or hsst\u03b4, e.g. CHO or COS cells.</p>\n  Membranes are prepared according to known methods, e.g. as disclosed by C. Bruns et al. in Biochem. J., 1990, 65, page 39-44. Membranes prepared from hsst selective cell lines, e.g. CHO or COS cells stably expressing hsstl or hsst2 or hsst3 or hsst4 or hsst\u03b4 are incubated in triplicate in a total volume of 300 \u03bcl at 22\u00b0C for 30 min with increasing concentrations of [<sup>125</sup>l-Tyr<sup>11</sup>]-SRIF-14 in 10 mmol/l Hepes buffer (pH 7.6) containing 0.\u03b4% BSA. The incubation is terminated by rapid filtration and the filters are counted in a counter. Specific binding is total binding minus non-specific binding in the presence of 1 \u03bcmol/l somatostatin-14. The experiments are carried out in triplicate. The affinity constant (K<sub>D</sub>) and number of binding sites are calculated using appropriate statistics and graphical programs.</p>\n  Compound A has in the above binding assays towards hsstl , hsst2, hsst3 and/or hsst\u03b4 an IC<sub>50</sub> in the nMolar range, preferably an IC<sub>50</sub> of from 0.1 to 10 nM (IC<sub>50</sub> = concentration for half-maximal inhibition in a competition binding assay using [<sup>125</sup>l-Tyr<sup>11</sup>]-SRIF-14 as hsstl -\u03b4 specific radioligand.</p>\n  IC 50 hsstl hsst2 hsst3 hsst4 hsst\u03b4</p>\n  Compound A 9.3 nM\u00b1O.1 1.0 nM+0.1 1.\u03b4 nM\u00b10.3 &gt;100 nM 0.16nM\u00b10.1</p>\n  Compound A also binds to growth hormone secretagogue receptors. Such receptors are disclosed by G. Muccioli et al., J. Endocrinol. 1998, 1\u03b47, 99-106, by H. Ong et al., in Endocrinology 1998, 139, 432-435 and by R.G. Smith et al., Horm. Res., 1999, 3), 1-8. The binding assay to these receptors may be carried out as disclosed in J. Endocrinol. Invest. 24: RC1-RC3, 2001. In this assay, Compound A displaces <sup>125</sup>l-Tyr-Ala-hexarelin. Compound \n\nA is accordingly useful for modulating the activity of growth hormone secretagogue receptors, e.g. indicating a possible role in body weight gain or metabolic regulation.</p>\n  Furthermore, Compound A shows GH-release inhibiting activity as indicated by the inhibition of GH release in vitro from cultured pituitary cells. For example, anterior pituitary glands from adult male rats are cut into small pieces and dispersed using 0.1 % trypsin in 20 mM HEPES buffer. The dispersed cells are cultured for four days in MEM (Gibco) supplemented with 5 % fetal calf serum, 5% horse serum, 1 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2.\u03b4 nM dexamethasone, 2.5 mg/ml insulin and 20 U/ml Pen/Strep. On the day of the experiment the attached cells are washed two times with Krebs-Ringer medium buffered with 20 mM HEPES and supplemented with 5 mM glucose and 0.2 % BSA. Subsequently the cells are incubated for three hours with Compound A in the presence of 3x10<sup>\"10</sup> M growth hormone releasing factor. The amount of growth hormone released into the medium is measured by RIA. Compound A has an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.4 nM in this assay.</p>\n  Compound A inhibits the release of growth hormone (GH) in rats. Compound A is administered s.c. to anaesthetized rats. Blood is collected after decapitation 1 h after administration of t"
