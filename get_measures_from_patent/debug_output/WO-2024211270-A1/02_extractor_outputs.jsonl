{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nMeasurement was done in triplicate suggesting pKa of 8.99 \u00b1 0.6 (SD). \n\n\nNote that there is only one sentence that contains a specific molecule name (\"Compound 1\"), a bioactivity metric (\"pKa\"), a specific numeric value (\"8.99 \u00b1 0.6\"), but it does not have a unit. However, since \"pKa\" is a unitless metric, this sentence is still considered relevant.\n\n\nIf you would like to extract more information, please let me know and I can try to help further."}
