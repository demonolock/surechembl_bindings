DSC analysis shows endotherm at 216.6\u00b0C (T<sub>pea</sub>k) with 0.11 wt% loss in TGA between RT to 100\u00b0C (FIG. 2). </p>Table 6. Solid-state Characterization of Compound 1 Form FB-1 \n<img id=\"imgf000032_0001\" path=\"imgf000032_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/1305716281/WO/20241010/A1/002024/21/12/70/imgf000032_0001.tif\"/>\n pKa measurement </p>[00226] Material used in this study was FB-1. Dissociation constant of Compound 1 freebase was measured using potentiometric acid-base titration. Experiment procedure is described below. Measurement was done in triplicate suggesting pKa of 8.99 \u00b1 0.6 (SD). Experiment and predicted pKa values were similar. </p>Procedure: </p>1) Weighed ~10 mg of starting material in 10 ml of MeOH </p>2) Added 25 mb of 0.5M NaCl </p>3) Adjusted pH value to around 3-4 with 0.1 M HC1 </p>4) Titrated above solution with 0.5M NaOH solution from pH 3-12 </p>Table 7: pKa of Compound 1 Form FB-1 \n<img id=\"imgf000032_0002\" path=\"imgf000032_0002.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/1305716282/WO/20241010/A1/002024/21/12/70/imgf000032_0002.tif\"/>\n </p>Water activity determination </p>[00227] Material used in this study was FB-1. Water activity of Compound 1 freebase was measured using Aqualab TDL-2. Experiment procedure is described below. Measurement was done in duplicate and material showed water activity of 0.47. </p>Procedure: </p>1) Took approximately 3-5 m of reference standard in sample dish </p>2) Set Aqualab TDL-2 temperature to 25 \u00b0C </p>3) Closed the sample chamber and start measurement </p>4) Confirmed reference solution values are within the standard limit </p>5) In new sample dish took approximately 50-100 mg of API and started the measurement \n\nTable 8: Water activity of Compound 1 Form FB-1 \n<img id=\"imgf000033_0001\" path=\"imgf000033_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/1305716283/WO/2024101"
