    "tions were successful in removing the deamidated variant, thus providing the ability to remove the inactive species during purification. Since the deamidation occurred in the PE38 portion of the fusion construct, the chromatographic conditions can be applied to removal of any deamidated variant of a PE conjugate.</p>CAT-8015 was renatured from isolated inclusion bodies and subsequently purified by a 4-column process. Table 1 provides an overview of the renaturation and purification unit operations.</p>TABLE 1CAT-8015 productionStepUnit Operation1Fermentation2Primary Recovery3Inclusion Body Isolation4Refold5Capture Step6Intermediate Purification Step I7Intermediate Purification Step II8Anion Exchange Chromatography9Formulation (Drug Substance)</p>FIG. 1 shows the analytical ion exchange chromatography (IEC) profile of a sample of a CAT-8015 reference standard. As shown in the profile, a pre-peak emerges prior to the elution of the main peak. The individual fractions eluted from the IEC are assayed for CAT-8015 biological activity relative to a reference standard using an apoptosis bioassay that measures the ability of the test sample to induce dose dependent apoptotic death of the CD22 receptor-expressing Daudi cell line. Once bound to CD22 and internalized, CAT-8015 induces Daudi cells to undergo apoptosis via Caspase 3/7 activation that can be measured by Caspase-Glo\u2122 3/7 Assay System. The potency of the test sample is determined by dividing the 50% effective concentration (EC50) of the Reference Standard by the EC50 of the test sample. The results of the apoptosis bioassay demonstrated that the relative potency of CAT-8015 is correlated with the percentage of pre-peak of CAT-8015 as diagrammed in FIG. 1. FIG. 2 shows the correlation between this relative potency and the percentage of pre-peak.</p>Pre-peak and main peak fractions from multiple IEC analysis were collected, pooled and subjected to peptide mapping and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Results were compared to those obtained from peptide mapping and LC-MS/MS experiments of purified CAT-8015. The analysis of purified CAT-8015 drug substance revealed that Asn-358 was partially deamidated to Asp-358 and iso-Asp-358 (Table 2). Asp-358 and iso-Asp358 were found to be significantly enriched in the pre-peak fraction whereas the main peak fraction was enriched in intact CAT-8015 (Table 2). Taken together, the results demonstrate that deamidation at Asn-358 lead to a loss of relative potency in a cell based bioassay. The Asp-358 residue is present within the PE toxin portion of the immunoconjugate thus indicating that an immunoconjugate containing a PE toxin, or variant thereof, in which Asp-358 is present will likely be subject to deamidation and subject to a loss of potency or activity.</p>TABLE 2Distribution of Amino Acid 358 in CAT-8015 DrugSubstance, Pre-Peak and Main Peak Fractions basedon Peptide Mapping and LC-MS/MS Analysis.AminoDrug SubstancePre-PeakMain PeakAcid(%)(%)(%)N358"
