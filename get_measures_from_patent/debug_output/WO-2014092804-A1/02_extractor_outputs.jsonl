{"raw_mentions": "Hundsrucker et al. (2006, Biochem J 396:297-306) developed still other peptide competitors for AKAP binding to PKA, with a binding constant as low as 0.4 nM to the DDD of the RII form of PKA."}

{"raw_mentions": "At the onset, the CL2E-Iinked SN-38 conjugate had a promisingly similar IC50 as the CL2A conjugate in the Raji cell line, which was consistent with the view that if rapidly internalized, both conjugates would release the active form of SN-38 at approximately the same rate."}
