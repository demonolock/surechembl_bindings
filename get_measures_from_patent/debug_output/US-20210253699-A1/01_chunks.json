Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, \u201cbinding affinity\u201d refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1:1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., antibody and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>). Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art, including those described herein. Specific illustrative and exemplary embodiments for measuring binding affinity are described in the following.</p>An \u201caffinity matured\u201d antibody refers to an antibody with one or more alterations in one or more hypervariable regions (HVRs), compared to a parent antibody which does not possess such alterations, such alterations optionally resulting in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen.</p>The term \u201cantibody\u201d herein is used in the broadest sense and encompasses various antibody structures, including but not limited to monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies), and antibody fragments so long as they exhibit the desired antigen-binding activity.</p>An \u201cantibody fragment\u201d refers to a molecule other than an intact antibody that comprises a portion of an intact antibody that binds the antigen to which the intact antibody binds.

    " as described in the na\u00efve discovery. In the different FACS rounds the libraries were looked at for PSR binding, and affinity pressure by antigen titration down to 0.5 nM. Sorting was performed in order to obtain a population with the desired characteristics.</p>Antibody Optimization</p>Optimization of antibodies was performed by introducing diversities into the heavy chain variable regions as described below.</p>CDRH1 and CDRH2 selection: The CDRH3 of a single antibody was recombined into a premade library with CDRH1 and CDRH2 variants of a diversity of 1\u00d710<sup>8 </sup>and selections were performed with one round of MACS and three rounds of FACS as described in the na\u00efve discovery. In the different FACS rounds the libraries were looked at for PSR binding, mouse cross-reactivity, and affinity pressure by titration or affinity pressure by pre-complexing the antigen with parental Fab or parental IgG to enrich for binders with higher affinity than the parental IgG. Sorting was performed in order to obtain a population with the desired characteristics.</p>Antibody Production and Purification</p>Yeast clones were grown to saturation and then induced for 48 hours at 30\u00b0 C. with shaking. After induction, yeast cells were pelleted and the supernatants were harvested for purification. IgGs were purified using a Protein A column and eluted with acetic acid, pH 2.0. Fab fragments were generated by papain digestion and purified over KappaSelect (GE Healthcare LifeSciences).</p>ForteBio KD Measurements</p>ForteBio affinity measurements were performed on an Octet RED384 generally as previously described (see, e.g., Estep et al, High throughput solution-based measurement of antibody-antigen affinity and epitope binning. Mabs 5(2), 270-278 (2013)). Briefly, ForteBio affinity measurements were performed by loading IgGs on-line onto AHQ sensors. Sensors were equilibrated off-line in assay buffer for 30 min and then monitored on-line for 60 seconds for baseline establishment. Sensors with loaded IgGs were exposed to 100 nM antigen for 3 minutes, and afterwards were transferred to assay buffer for 3 min for off-rate measurement. All kinetics were analyzed using the 1:1 binding model.</p>ForteBio Epitope Binning/Ligand Blocking</p>Epitope binning/ligand blocking was performed using a standard sandwich format cross-blocking assay. Control anti-target IgG or receptor was loaded onto AHQ sensors and unoccupied Fc-binding sites on the sensor were blocked with an irrelevant (non-target) human IgG1 antibody. The sensors were then exposed to 100 nM target antigen followed by a second anti-target antibody. Additional binding by the second antibody after antigen association indicates an unoccupied epitope (non-competitor), while no binding indicates epitope blocking (competitor or ligand blocking).</p>Biacore Kintetic Assay</p>For the Biacore-based measurements, the antigen was covalently coupled to a anti mouse-Fc capture C1 chip using an amine-coupling kit (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences). Association between the antigen and a five-point three-fold titration of the antibody starting at 27 nM was measured for 300 sec. Subsequently, dissociation between the antigen and antibody was measured for 3600 sec. Kinetic data was analyzed and fitted globally using a 1:1 binding model.</p>Example 2. Anti-CD112R Antibodies Bind to CD112ROn Cell Binding Assay</p>The ability of anti-CD112R antibodies to bind to CD112R expressed on cells was evaluated. 1\u00d710<sup>5 </sup>Jurkat cells (acute T cell leukemia cell line, ATCC #TIB-152) that were either wild type or engineered to over-express human CD112R (Jurkat-CD112R OE) were added to each well of a 96-well V bottom plate and stained with either anti-CD112R antibodies or an IgG1 isotype control (0.63 \u03bcg/mL) for 1 hour at 4\u00b0 C. Cells were washed twice with PBS+2% FCS and resuspended with Alexa Fluor\u00ae 647 anti-human IgG Fc antibody (Biolegend, Cat #409320) diluted 1:100 in PBS+2% FCS and incubated at 4\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes. Cells were subsequently washed twice and resuspended in PBS+2% FCS. Cellular data was acquired using a LSRFortessa X-20 (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star).</p>Results are depicted in FIG. 1. Quantitation of antibody binding to Jurkat-CD112R OE cells was assessed by the geometric mean fluorescent intensity (gMFI) of the Alexa Fluor\u00ae 647 signal. These results demonstrate that anti-CD112R antibodies bind to cells that express CD112R. A summary of antibody binding is shown in Table 2.</p>Example 3.
