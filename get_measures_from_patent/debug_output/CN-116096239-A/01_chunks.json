Cytokines are peptides that cannot penetrate the lipid bilayer of a cell into the cytoplasm. Inflammatory or proinflammatory cytokines are signaling molecules (cytokines) secreted by immune cells such as helper T cells (Th) and macrophages, and certain other cell types that promote inflammation. They include, but are not limited to, interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-12 and IL-18, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon gamma (IFN gamma), and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and play an important role in mediating the innate immune response. Inflammatory cytokines are mainly produced by and involved in the upregulation of the inflammatory response. The term \"anti-inflammatory cytokine\" includes immunomodulatory molecules that control the response of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Cytokines interact with specific cytokine inhibitors and soluble cytokine receptors to modulate the immune response in humans. The major anti-inflammatory cytokines include Interleukin (IL) -1 receptor antagonists, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-11, and IL-13. Specific cytokine receptors for IL-1",

As shown in fig. 12, NEM-HMGB1 induced neutrophil formation NET, suggesting that NEM modification of rhmmgb 1 only specifically interfered with its ability to bind HJ DNA. Finally, the anti-biofilm function of NEM-rHMGB1 was analyzed as described above and demonstrated that NEM-rHMGB1 lost its anti-biofilm activity (FIG. 10B). These results indicate that HMGB1 breaks down the biofilm by its ability to bind directly to HJ-like structures in the extracellular matrix of the biofilm.</p><p id=\"p0859\" num=\"0857\">Next, HMGB1 was tested for the possibility of mediating its anti-biofilm effect by binding to DNABII protein.
