    "ocardial infarction, and increased cognitive dysfunction; restenosis; and C5 mediated complement complications relating to percutaneous coronary intervention), ischemia-reperfusion injury (e.g., myocardial infarction, stroke, frostbite), complement-related inflammatory disorders (e.g., asthma, arthritis, sepsis, and rejection after organ transplantation), and complement-related autoimmune disorders (e.g., myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)). Other indications for which C5 inhibition is desirable include, for example, lung inflammation (Mulligan et al. (1998) J. Clin. Invest. 98:503), extracorporeal complement activation (Rinder et al.

Immunol. 142:2654), glomerulonephritis and other renal diseases, ocular indications such as C5 mediated ocular tissue damage, e.g. diabetic retinopathy, and paroxysomal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. These aptamers may also be used in diagnostics.</p>These aptamers may include modifications as described herein including, e.g., conjugation to lipophilic or high molecular weight compounds (e.g., PEG), incorporation of a capping moiety, incorporation of modified nucleotides, and modifications to the phosphate back bone.</p>In one embodiment of the present disclosure an isolated, non-naturally occurring aptamer that binds to the C5 complement protein is provided. In some embodiments, the isolated, non-naturally occurring aptamer has a dissociation constant (\"K<sub>d</sub>\") for C5 complement protein of less than 100 \u00b5M, less than 1 \u00b5M, less than 500 nM, less than 100 nM, less than 50 nM, less than 1 nM, less than 500pM, less than 100 pM, less than 50 pM. In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the dissociation constant is determined by dot blot titration as described in Example 1 below.</p>In another embodiment, the aptamer of the invention modulates a function of the C5 complement protein. In another embodiment, the aptamer of the present disclosure inhibits a C5 function while in another embodiment the aptamer stimulates a function of C5. A C5 complement protein variant as used herein encompasses variants that perform essentially the same function as a C5 complement protein function. A C5 complement protein variant preferably comprises substantially the same structure and in some embodiments comprises 80% sequence identity, more preferably 90% sequence identity, and more preferably 95% sequence identity to the amino acid sequence of the C5 complement protein comprising the amino acid sequence below (SEQ ID NO: 102) (cited in Haviland et al., J Immunol. 1991 Jan 1;146(1):362-8).:\n<img id=\"ib0015\" path=\"imgb0015.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/431687018/EP/20180411/B1/000002/86/02/51/imgb0015.tif\"/></p>In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the sequence identity of target variants is determined using BLAST as described below. The terms \"sequence identity\" in the context of two or more nucleic acid or protein sequences, refer to two or more sequences or subsequences that are the same or have a specified percentage of amino acid residues or nucleotides that are the same, when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence, as measured usi",
    "midyl active ester moieties from N-hydroxy succinimide.</p>In many applications, it is desirable to cap the PEG molecule on one end with an essentially non-reactive moiety so that the PEG molecule is mono-functional (or mono-activated). In the case of protein therapeutics which generally display multiple reaction sites for activated PEGs, bi-functional activated PEGs lead to extensive cross-linking, yielding poorly functional aggregates. To generate mono-activated PEGs, one hydroxyl moiety on the terminus of the PEG diol molecule typically is substituted with non-reactive methoxy end moniety, -OCH<sub>3</sub>\u2022 The other, un-capped terminus of the PEG molecule typically is converted to a reactive end moiety that can be activated for attachment at a reactive site on a surface or a molecule such as a protein.</p>PAGs are polymers which typically have the properties of solubility in water and in many organic solvents, lack of toxicity, and lack of immunogenicity. One use of PAGs is to covalently attach the polymer to insoluble molecules to make the resulting PAG-molecule \"conjugate\" soluble. For example, it has been shown that the water-insoluble drug paclitaxel, when coupled to PEG, becomes water-soluble. Greenwald, et al., J. Org. Chem., 60:331-336 (1995). PAG conjugates are often used not only to enhance solubility and stability but also to prolong the blood circulation half-life of molecules.</p>Polyalkylated compounds of the present disclosure are typically between 5 and 80 kD in size however any size can be used, the choice dependent on the aptamer and application. Other PAG compounds of the present disclosure are between 10 and 80 kD in size. Still other PAG compounds of the present disclosure are between 10 and 60 kD in size. For example, a PAG polymer may be at least 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, or 80 kD in size. Such polymers can be linear or branched.</p>In contrast to biologically-expressed protein therapeutics, nucleic acid therapeutics are typically chemically synthesized from activated monomer nucleotides. PEG-nucleic acid conjugates may be prepared by incorporating the PEG using the same iterative monomer synthesis. For example, PEGs activated by conversion to a phosphoramidite form can be incorporated into solid-phase oligonucleotide synthesis. Alternatively, oligonucleotide synthesis can be completed with site-specific incorporation of a reactive PEG attachment site. Most commonly this has been accomplished by addition of a free primary amine at the 5'-terminus (incorporated using a modified phosphoramidite in the last coupling step of solid phase synthesis). Using this approach, a reactive PEG (e.g., one which is activated so that it will react and form a bond with an amine) is combined with the purified oligonucleotide and the coupling reaction is carried out in solution. In some embodiment the polymers are branched PEG molecules. In still other embodiments the polymers are 40 kDa branched PEG, see, e.g. (1,3-bis(mPEG-[20 kDa])-propyl-2-(4'-butamide) depicted in Figure 4. In some embodiments the 40 kD branched PEG (1,3-bis(mPEG-[20 kDa])-propyl-2-(4'-butamide) is attached to the 5' end of the aptamer as depicted in Figure 5.</p>The ability of PEG conjugation to alter the biodistribution of a therapeutic is related to a number of factors including the apparent size (e.g., as measured in terms of hydrodynamic radius) of the conjugate. Larger conjugates (&gt;10kDa) are known to more effectively block filtration via the kidney and to consequently increase the serum half-life of small macromolecules (e.g., peptides, antisense oligonucleotides). The ability of PEG conjugates to block filtration has been shown to increase with PEG size up to approximately 50 kDa (further increases have minimal beneficial effect as half life becomes defined by macrophage-mediated metabolism rather than elimination via the kidneys).</p>Production of high molecular weight PEGs (&gt;10 kDa) can be difficult, inefficient, and expensive. As a route towards the synthesis of high molecular weight PEG-nucleic acid conjugates, previous work has been focused towards the generation of higher molecular weight activated PEGs. One method for generating such molecules involves the formation of a branched activated PEG in which two or more PEGs are attached to a central core carrying the activated group. The terminal portions of these higher molecular weight PEG molecules, i.e., the relatively non-reactive hydroxyl (-OH) moieties, can be activated, or converted to functional moieties, for attachment of one or ",
    "ated higher molecular weight PEG molecules are referred to herein as, multi-activated PEGs. In some cases, not all termini in a branch PEG molecule are activated. In cases where any two termini of a branch PEG molecule are activated, such PEG molecules are referred to as bi-activated PEGs. In some cases where only one terminus in a branch PEG molecule is activated, such PEG molecules are referred to as mono-activated. As an example of this approach, activated PEG prepared by the attachment of two monomethoxy PEGs to a lysine core which is subsequently activated for reaction has been described (Harris et al., Nature, vol.2: 214-221,2003).</p>The present disclosure provides another cost effective route to the synthesis of high molecular weight PEG-nucleic acid (preferably, aptamer) conjugates including multiply PEGylated nucleic acids. The present disclosure also encompasses PEG-linked multimeric oligonucleotides, e.g., dimerized aptamers. The present disclosure also relates to high molecular weight compositions where a PEG stabilizing moiety is a linker which separates different portions of an aptamer, e.g., the PEG is conjugated within a single aptamer sequence, such that the linear arrangement of the high molecular weight aptamer composition is, e.g., nucleic acid - PEG - nucleic acid (- PEG - nucleic acid)<sub>n</sub> where n is greater than or equal to 1.</p>High molecular weight compositions of the present disclosure include those having a molecular weight of at least 10 kD. Compositions typically have a molecular weight between 10 and 80 kD in size. High molecular weight compositions of the present disclosure are at least 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, or 80 kD in size.</p>A stabilizing moiety is a molecule, or portion of a molecule, which improves pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the high molecular weight aptamer compositions of the present disclosure. In some cases, a stabilizing moiety is a molecule or portion of a molecule which brings two or more aptamers, or aptamer domains, into proximity, or provides decreased overall rotational freedom of the high molecular weight aptamer compositions of the present disclosure. A stabilizing moiety can be a polyalkylene glycol, such a polyethylene glycol, which can be linear or branched, a homopolymer or a heteropolymer. Other stabilizing moieties include polymers such as peptide nucleic acids (PNA). Oligonucleotides can also be stabilizing moieties; such oligonucleotides can include modified nucleotides, and/or modified linkages, such as phosphorothioates. A stabilizing moiety can be an integral part of an aptamer composition, i.e., it is covalently bonded to the aptamer.</p>Compositions of the present disclosure include high molecular weight aptamer compositions in which two or more nucleic acid moieties are covalently conjugated to at least one polyalkylene glycol moiety. The polyalkylene glycol moieties serve as stabilizing moieties. In compositions where a polyalkylene glycol moiety is covalently bound at either end to an aptamer, such that the polyalkylene glycol joins the nucleic acid moieties together in one molecule, the polyalkylene glycol is said to be a linki",
    "e-buffered saline containing 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> at room temperature (23\u00b0C) and 37\u00b0C, for 15 min and 4 hr time intervals. The binding reactions were analyzed by nitrocellulose filtration using a Minifold I dot-blot, 96-well vacuum filtration manifold (Schleicher &amp; Schuell, Keene, NH). A three-layer filtration medium was used, consisting (from top to bottom) of Protran nitrocellolose (Schleicher &amp; Schuell), Hybond-P nylon (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) and GB002 gel blot paper (Schleicher &amp; Schuell). The nitrocellulose layer, which selectively binds protein over nucleic acid, preferentially retained the anti-C5 aptamer in complex with a protein ligand, while non-complexed anti-C5 aptamer passed through the nitrocellulose and adhered to the nylon. The gel blot paper was included simply as a supporting medium for the other filters. Following filtration, the filter layers were separated, dried and exposed on a phosphor screen (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified using a Storm 860 Phosphorimager\u00ae blot imaging system (Amersham Biosciences).</p>As shown in shown in Figure 9 and Figure 10, increasing C5 concentrations enhance the proportion of ARC 186 captured on the nitrocellulose membrane. The dependence of bound ARC186 on increasing C5 concentrations is well-described by a single-site binding model (C5 + ARC186 \u2194 C5\u2022ARC186; % bound = C<sub>max</sub> / (1 + K<sub>D</sub> / [C5]); C<sub>max</sub> is the maximum % bound at saturating [C5]; K<sub>D</sub> is the dissociation constant). ARC186 binding curves at two temperatures following either a 15 min or a 4 hr incubation are shown in Figures 9 and 10, respectively. Following a 15 min incubation, the ARC186 binding curves at 23 and 37\u00b0C are essentially indistinguishable within error, fitting with K<sub>D</sub> values of 0.5 - 0.6 nM (Figure 9). Differences between binding curves at 23 and 37\u00b0C become more pronounced when the incubation time is extended. Following a 4 hr incubation (Figure 10), the K<sub>D</sub> observed at 23\u00b0C decreases to 0.08 \u00b1 0.01 nM, while the K<sub>D</sub> observed at 37\u00b0C remains unchanged (0.6 \u00b1 0.1 nM).</p>To demonstrate the basis for the long incubation requirement at room temperature, the affinity at this temperature was further explored using kinetic methods. The rate of the reverse reaction describing the dissociation of C5\u2022ARC186 is \u03bd<sub>rev</sub> = k-<sub>1</sub>[C5\u2022ARC186], where \u03bd<sub>rev</sub> is the rate (units of M min<sup>-1</sup>) and k-<sub>1</sub> is the first order dissociation rate constant (units of min<sup>-1</sup>). The rate of the forward reaction describing the formation of the C5\u2022ARC186 complex is \u03bd<sub>for</sub> = k<sub>1</sub>[C5][ARC186], where \u03bd<sub>for</sub> is the rate (units of M min<sup>-1</sup>) and k<sub>1</sub> is the second order association rate constant (units of M<sup>-1</sup>min<sup>-1</sup>). The data were analyzed using the pseudo-first order assumption, where the concentration of one reactant (C5 in this case) is "
