    "AP kinase isoforms.</p>A \u201cdirect inhibitor\u201d of a p38 MAP kinase is an inhibitor, which interacts with the kinase or binding partner thereof or with a nucleic acid encoding the kinase.</p>An \u201cindirect inhibitor\u201d of a p38 MAP kinase is an inhibitor which interacts upstream or downstream of the kinase in the regulatory pathway and which does not interacts with the kinase or binding partner thereof or with a nucleic acid encoding the kinase.</p>Preferably, the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor is not a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor.</p>If acting on p38 MAP kinase directly, in one embodiment the inhibitor should exhibit an IC<sub>50 </sub>value of about 5 \u03bcM or less, preferably 500 nM or less, more preferably 100 nM or less.</p>Those skilled in the art can determine whether or not a compound is useful in the present invention by evaluating its p38 MAP kinase activity as well as its relative IC<sub>50 </sub>value. This evaluation can, for example, be accomplished through conventional in vitro assays, such as by using one or more of the assays described below. In vitro assays include assays that assess inhibition of kinase or ATPase activity of activated p38 MAP kinase. In vitro assays can also assess the ability of the inhibitor to bind p38 MAP kinase or to reduce or block an identified downstream effect of activated p38 MAP kinase, e.g., cytokine secretion. IC<sub>50 </sub>values are calculated using the concentration of inhibitor that causes a 50% decrease as compared to a control.</p>A binding assay is a fairly inexpensive and simple in vitro assay to run. Binding of a molecule to p38 MAP kinase, in and of itself, can be inhibitory, due to steric, allosteric or charge-charge interactions. A binding assay can be performed in solution or on a solid phase using p38 MAP kinase or a fragment thereof as a target. By using this as an initial screen, one can evaluate libraries of compounds for potential p38 MAP kinase regulatory activity.</p>The target in a binding assay can be either free in solution, fixed to a support, or expressed in or on the surface of a cell. A label (e.g. radioactive, fluorescent, quenching, etc.) can be placed on the target, compound, or both to determine the presence or absence of binding. This approach can also be used to conduct a competitive binding assay to assess the inhibition of binding of a target to a natural or artificial substrate or binding partner. In any case, one can measure, either directly or indirectly, the amount of free label versus bound label to determine binding. There are many known variations and adaptations of this approach to minimize interference with binding activity and optimize signal.</p>For purposes of in vitro cellular assays, the compounds that represent potential inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase function can be administered to a cell in any number of ways.</p>Preferably, the compound or composition can be added to the medium in which the cell is growing, such as tissue culture medium for cells grown in culture. The compound is provided in standard serial dilutions or in an amount determined by analogy to known modulators. Alternatively, the potential inhibitor can be encoded by a nucleic acid that is introduced into the cell wherein the cell produces the potential inhibitor itself.</p>Alternative assays involving in vitro analysis of potential inhibitors include those where cells (e.g., HeLa) transfected with DNA coding for relevant kinases can be activated with substances such as sorbitol, IL-1, TNF, or PMA. After immunoprecipitation of cell lysates, equal aliquots of immune complexes of the kinases are pre-incubated for an adequate time with a specific concentration of the potential inhibitor followed by addition of kinase substrate buffer mix containing labeled ATP and GST-ATF2 or "
