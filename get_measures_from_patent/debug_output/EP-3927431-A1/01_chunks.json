    " In some embodiments, TCRP V6-5*01 is encoded by the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 43, or a sequence having 85%, 90%, 95%, 99% or more identity thereof. In some embodiments, TCRP V6-5*01 comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 44, or a sequence having 85%, 90%, 95%, 99% or more identity thereof. </p> In some embodiments, the multifunctional molecule includes an immune cell engager. \u201cAn immune cell engager\u201d refers to one or more binding specificities that bind and/or activate an immune cell, e.g., a cell involved in an immune response. In embodiments, the immune cell is chosen from a T cell, an NK cell, a B cell, a dendritic cell, and/or the macrophage cell. The immune cell engager can be an antibody molecule, a receptor molecule (e.g., a full length receptor, receptor fragment, or fusion thereof (e.g., a receptor-Fc fusion)), or a ligand molecule (e.g., a full length ligand, ligand fragment, or fusion thereof (e.g., a ligand-Fc fusion)) that binds to the immune cell antigen (e.g., the T cell, the NK cell antigen, the B cell antigen, the dendritic cell antigen, and/or the macrophage cell antigen). In embodiments, the immune cell engager specifically binds to the target immune cell, e.g., binds preferentially to the target immune cell. For example, when the immune cell engager is an antibody molecule, it binds to an immune cell antigen (e.g., a T cell antigen, an NK cell antigen, a B cell antigen, a dendritic cell antigen, and/or a macrophage cell antigen) with a dissociation constant of less than about 10 nM. </p> In some embodiments, the multifunctional molecule includes a cytokine molecule. As used herein, a\u201ccytokine molecule\u201d refers to full length, a fragment or a variant of a cytokine; a cytokine further comprising a receptor domain, e.g., a cytokine receptor dimerizing domain; or an agonist of a cytokine receptor, e.g., an antibody molecule (e.g., an agonistic antibody) to a cytokine receptor, that elicits at least one activity of a naturally-occurring cytokine. In some embodiments the cytokine molecule is chosen from interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-7 (IF-7), interleukin- 12 (IL-12), interleukin- 15 (IL-15), interleukin- 18 (IL-18), interleukin -21 (IL-21), or \n\n interferon gamma, or a fragment or variant thereof, or a combination of any of the aforesaid cytokines. The cytokine molecule can be a monomer or a dimer. In embodiments, the cytokine molecule can further include a cytokine receptor dimerizing domain. In other embodiments, the cytokine molecule is an agonist of a cytokine receptor, e.g., an antibody molecule (e.g., an agonistic antibody) to a cytokine receptor chosen from an IL-15Ra or IL-21R. </p> As used herein, the term\u201cmolecule\u201d as used in, e.g., antibody molecule, cytokine molecule, receptor molecule, includes full-length, naturally-occurring molecules, as well as variants, e.g., functional variants (e.g., truncations, fragments, mutated (e.g., substantially similar sequences) or derivatized form thereof), so lon",
