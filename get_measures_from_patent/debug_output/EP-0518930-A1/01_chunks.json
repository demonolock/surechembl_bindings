    " into 1 litre nitrogen bubbled Milli-Q\u00ae water. Standardize this carbon dioxide free NaOH solution in the normal way with potassium hydrogen phthalate.</p>A phosphate buffer solution (0.025 M disodium hydrogen ortho-phosphate and 0.025 M potassium dihydrogen phosphate) of pH -7 is used to standardize the pH meter since the iso pH of the ROSS electrode is 7. Either 0.05 M potassium hydrogen phthalate solution (pH -4) or 0.01 M disodium tetraborate solution (pH -9)</p>SUBSTITUTESHEET \n\n can be used to determine the slope depending on the pH range of the measurement. Generally the pH 4 buffer is preferred because of the interference of carbon dioxide at high pH.</p>The direct pH titrations for the cyclodextrin derivatives are performed in the normal way. 0.5 ml increments of the titrants produces sufficient number of data points for high precision data fitting. The results of pKa and the fitted purities are usually checked with back titrations, in which acid or base of high concentration is added (normally not more than 10 ml) to reach the pH value of the final end point estimated from a direct titration before the recorded titration is performed in the normal manner. If the sample is a base, nitrogen purging for half an hour follows the acidification before the back titration with the NaOH. The temperature was held at 25.0 \u00b0C for all the experiments reported below.</p>The relationship between the volume of the added titrant and the resulted pH value can be derived from the acid dissociation constant expressions and the charge and mass balance equations. The theoretical titrant volume is expressed as a non-linear function of the corresponding concentration of free acid (converted from the measured pH value) , with the total amount of sample used (in millimole) and the initial volume (millilitre) of the solution as the fixed parameters and the estimated acid dissociation constants as the variable parameters. The calculated volumes are compared to the experimental values using a non-linear least squares fitting computer program. The new values are calculated via reestimation of the unknown acid dissociation constants in continuous iteration until convergence (within the specified limit of error) is found between the measured and calculated titrant volumes. This process allows the establishment of the best-fit values for the acid dissociation constants of the chemicals titrated.</p>Prior to the fitting process, the measured pH values are corrected for electrode error. The slopes and the intercepts of</p>SUBSTITUTESHEET \n\nthe linear equation for the pH correction are experimentally determined for different conditions (mainly ionic strength) by titrating standardized HCl with standardized NaOH. The p^ for different ionic strength are also determined by the same experiments and the appropriate value is used in the fitting.</p>[potassium chloride] = 0.5, T = 25.0 \u00b0C pH(corrected) = 1.0035 x pH(measured) + 0.085, pKw = 13.90</p>[potassium chloride]=0.0, T = ",

For each concentration of drug used as eluant a 50 \u03bcL sample of pure buffer is run as a blank, followed by 50 \u03bcL samples of each of the cyclodextrin solutions. Peaks are detected over the range 300 - 380 nm. The shorter wavelengths are used for increased sensitivity at the lower drug concentrations and the longer wavelengths are used to avoid detector overload at higher drug concentrations. The negative peak which occurs at about 6 minutes corresponds to a depletion of drug in the eluant due to both dilution (calculated from the injection of pure buffer) and inclusion of the drug by the cyclodextrin. The included drug elutes with the cyclodextrin at about 2 minutes and gives rise to a positive peak.</p>Integration of the negative peak and subtraction of the dilution factor allows the calculation of the number of moles of drug bound per mole of cyclodextrin injected (r) . The value r is a measure of the relative abilities of the cyclodextrin derivatives to bind a particular drug.</p>Measurement of r at different concentrations (L) allows the plotting of (r/L) vs. (r) , a Scatchard Plot, for each cyclodextrin studied. The plot should be a straight line with the Y-intercept equal to the binding constant (K) . ___.</p>SUBSTVTUTE SHEET \n\n EXAMPLE 119 Binding constants for Indomethacin with modified Cyclodextrins cf.
