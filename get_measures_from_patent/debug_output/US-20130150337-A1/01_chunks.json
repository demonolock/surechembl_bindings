    "hically separated. These operations are preferentially carried out at very early stages of the synthesis. More regioselective approaches comprise e.g. reaction of appropriate 4-ene-3-ones to the enamine, followed by reaction with perchloryl fluoride and subsequent aromatization to give 4-fluoroestradiols directly.</p>Another approach to selectively introduce fluorine consists of applying Schiemann-type reactions, by first isolating the 2- and 4-nitro derivatives, reducing them to the appropriate anilines and applying typical diazonium chemistry (NaNO<sub>2</sub>\u2014HBF<sub>4</sub>).</p>Chlorination may be carried out with chlorinating reagents like sulfuryl chloride, leading predominantly to 4-chloro-estrones or 4-chloroestradiol, whereas for selectively obtaining 2-chloro derivatives a more circuitous route is available, which starts from the 4-nitro derivative. This can be first chlorinated at the C2 position, after which a two-step reductive removal of the nitro group is accomplished; i.e. reduction to the aniline, conversion to a diazonium salt and removal with hypophosphoric acid.</p>An alternative direct method for regioselective introduction of chloro- or bromo-atoms entails conversion of 2-thallium(III)-complexes of estrones with copper chloride or copper bromide.</p>Alternative methods for synthesis of regio-isomers consist of dibromination to 2,4-dibromoestradiols, followed by regioselective reduction with either palladium on charcoal or the application of agents like KI, formic acid or ascorbic acid.</p>Introduction of alkyl substituents at the C7\u03b1-position is generally accomplished by reaction of 4,6-dien-3-ones with organocuprates, to produce 7\u03b1-alkyl-4-ene-3-ones, which upon aromatization provide 7\u03b1-alkylestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-3-ols. The 7\u03b2-isomers arising from these procedures (in variable amounts, depending on conditions and substituents) are removed either by chromatography or crystallization at appropriate stages (references 1, 7).</p>The C15\u03b2 substituents are introduced stereoselectively by reaction of 15-ene-17-ones with organocuprates. In order to obtain the required 15\u03b1-isomers, a double bond is introduced again (e.g. by Saegusa oxidation of 17-silylenolates), which upon catalytic reduction forces the C15 substituent in a 15\u03b1 position (reference 4). Alternatively, 15\u03b1-substituted estrones are obtained by initial introduction of a 15\u03b2 cyano group, which upon base-catalysed isomerization is converted into a 15\u03b1-cyano group and as such suitable for functional group interconversion to the desired 15\u03b1-derivatives (reference 5). A direct approach to synthesize 15\u03b1-alkyl steroids consists of biomimetic total synthesis as exemplified with the construction of 15\u03b1-methyl estrone.</p>In the case that 13-ethyl derivatives are required, 13-ethylestrone or 13-ethylnordion, both available via total synthetic methods (as amply documented in the chemistry of contraceptive steroids), may be used as starting materials in the sequences outlined in ",
