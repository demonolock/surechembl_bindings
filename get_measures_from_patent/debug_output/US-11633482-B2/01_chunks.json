    "m the 5\u2032 end of sense strand in the conjugate to be detected is respectively mismatched with the nucleotides T, A, C or G, in the corresponding position of the target sequence.</p>The target sequence was inserted into the Xho I/Not I site of the psiCHECK\u2122-2 plasmid.</p>Transfection</p>In a 96-well plate, siRNA and each of the above plasmids were co-transfected according to the instructions of Lipofectamine\u2122 2000 (Invitrogen), each plasmid with 11 groups of corresponding siRNA at certain concentrations, respectively. Specifically, 10 ng of plasmid was transfected per well; and the final concentration of siRNA co-transfected per well was from 100 nM to 0.0001 nM (4-fold serial dilutions), 3 replicate wells per group, using 0.2 \u03bcL of Lipofectamine\u2122 2000 per well.</p>Detection</p>24 hours post co-transfection, the HEK293A cells were lysed by using a dual luciferase reporter gene assay kit (Promega, cat. E2940) according to the instruction manual to detect the expression level of the dual luciferase reporter gene. For each test group of certain concentration, those untreated with the conjugate are used as control (con). The Renilla luciferase protein level (Ren) was normalized to the firefly luciferase protein level (Fir). The dose-response curves were plotted by the activity results measured at different siRNA concentrations, and the curves were modeled using Function log(inhibitor) vs. response-Variable slope of Graphpad 5.0 software with the formula below:</p>Y=Bot+Top-Bot1+10(LogIC50\u00b7X)\u00d7HillSlope\nwherein\n\nY is the expression level of remaining mRNA,\n\nX is the logarithm of the concentration of transfected siRNA,\n\nBot is the Y value at the bottom of the asymptote,\n\nTop is the Y value at the top of the asymptote,\n\nLogIC<sub>50 </sub>is the X value at which Y is median value between the bottom and the top of the asymptote, and HillSlope is the slope of the curve.\n</p>The IC<sub>50 </sub>of the conjugate to be detected corresponding to GSCM was determined via calculation based on the dose-effect curve, and then was compared with PSCM, GSSM or PSSM.</p>For Conjugate 24, the results are shown in FIGS. 12A-12D, and the IC<sub>50 </sub>value of Conjugate 24 corresponding to GSCM was calculated as 0.0019 nM; compared with PSCM, GSSM or PSSM, Conjugate 24 showed no significant inhibitory effect at each siRNA concentration, indicating that the siRNA conjugate of the present disclosure possesses relatively high activity in vitro and low off-target effects.</p>Experimental Example 5-2\u2014this Experiment Illustrates the Inhibitory Efficiency of the siRNA Conjugates in Table 3A in Expression of HBV mRNA In VivoIn this experimental example, the inhibitory efficiencies of Conjugates 16 and 24 in the expression of HBV mRNA in HBV transgenic mice C57BL/6J-Tg (Alb1HBV) 44Bri/J were investigated.</p>At first, C57BL/6J-Tg (Alb1HBV) 44Bri/J mice were randomly divided into groups based on HBsAg content in serum (all female, 4 mice in each group) and respectively numbered as "
