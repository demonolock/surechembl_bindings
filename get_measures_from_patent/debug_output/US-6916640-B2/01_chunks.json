In general, any commonly used substrates in cell studies can be used, non-limiting examples of which include collagen, cationic collagen, anionic collagen, anionic esterified hyaluronic acid, anionic amine-modified hyaluronic acid, fibronectin, and laminin. The biopolymers preferably are water-soluble and most often have a molecular weight of at least 20,000, preferably at least 75,000, more preferably at least 125,000, even more preferably at least 200,000, and yet even more preferably at least 250,000.</p>Whereas collagen has been used to encapsulate drugs, it has not found widespread use for encapsulating cells because, at neutral pH, there is insufficient charge density to form an encapsulating membrane. However, collagen modified to raise its pKi to at least about 9 is sufficiently positively charged at physiological pH to be complexed with oppositely-charged synthetic polyelectrolytes to form a coherent membrane. Collagen can be modified to form a more strongly basic polymer by converting the primary amino groups to tertiary amine groups or by esterification.</p>Anionic biopolymeric materials, such as hyaluronic acid (HA) and modified HA (esterified HA or amine-modified HA) are useful in the invention. In general, anionic biopolymers suitable for the practice of this invention will have a charge density of at least about 20%, preferably at least about 30%, and even more preferably at least about 50%. HA that is totally or partially esterified or reacted with a primary amine to render it less water-soluble will form a stronger complex with the polycationic outer layer than HA itself.</p>Preferred biopolymers for forming the inner layer of the encapsulating membrane are modified HA and modified collagen. Esterified collagen is particularly preferred as the inner layer. In general, the inner layer, though water-soluble, will be slightly hydrophobic.</p>Esterification or reaction to form tertiary amine groups on the biopolymer may be accomplished by reaction of the biopolymer with a wide variety of aliphatic reactants containing as many as about 18 carbon atoms in their chain. Such reactants include, inter alia, alcohols, primary amines and alcohol amines. Preferred reactants contain about 8 carbon atoms or less. For"
