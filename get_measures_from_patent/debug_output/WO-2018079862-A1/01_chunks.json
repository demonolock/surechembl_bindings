    "in the dark at room temperature (RT) until use. Cells were seeded at 12.5 k/well in white, clear bottom 384- well plates (Corning 3707) and left for one hour at RT followed by an overnight incubation (37 \u00b0C). The following day, the DMSO compound plate was diluted 1 :20 (5x FAC) in Opti-MEM I (Life Technologies 11058021). The growth media was removed from the cell plate and replaced with 15 \u03bc\u0390 Opti-MEM I, followed by a 5 \u03bc\u0390 addition from the 5x compound plate and a fifteen minute incubation (37 \u00b0C). Forskolin (Sigma F3917) was then added to the wells (5 \u03bc\u0390 of 2.5 \u03bc\u039c) and the plate was incubated for five hours (37 \u00b0C). During this incubation, the Steady Glo Substrate reagent was warmed to 37 \u00b0C. Aliquots \n\n (1 lml; stored at -20 \u00b0C) of this reagent were prepared by dissolving the contents of 1 vial of lyophilised substrate in 100 ml Steady-Glo buffer. A 25 \u03bc\u0390 addition of the substrate was made to all wells and the plate was incubated for thirty minutes at RT, on a plate shaker (300 rpm; in the dark). Luminescence was then measured using the EnVision Multilabel Reader (Perkin Elmer). </p>Compound activity was examined using a 10-point, half log concentration-response range and each concentration was tested in duplicate wells. Luminescence values were normalised to 'maximum' (forskolin alone) and 'minimum' (forskolin in the presence of tool mGluR7 agonist) controls. EC<sub>50</sub> values were derived from this data using non-linear regression and a four parameter curve fit. The EC50 values for the compounds of the Examples are shown in Table 1. </p>Results </p> Table 1 </p><img id=\"imgf000056_0001\" path=\"imgf000056_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/435273747/WO/20180503/A1/002018/07/98/62/imgf000056_0001.tif\"/></p>References </p>1.
