    "are also suitable for use in the formulations of the invention. Known and commercial mixtures mixtures are, for example comprising, as active ingredients, lecithin, L - (+) - ascorbyl palmitate and citric acid (for example (for example Oxynex <sup>\u00ae</sup> AP), natural tocopherols, L - (+) - ascorbyl palmitate, L - (+) - ascorbic acid and citric acid (for example Oxynex <sup>\u00ae</sup> K LIQUID), tocopherol extracts from natural sources, L - (+) - ascorbyl palmitate, L - (+) - ascorbic acid and citric acid (for example Oxynex <sup>\u00ae</sup> L LIQUID), DL-\u03b1-tocopherol, L - (+) - ascorbyl palmitate, citric acid and lecithin (eg Oxynex <sup>\u00ae</sup> LM) or</p>Butylhydroxytoluene (BHT), L - (+) - ascorbyl palmitate, and citric acid (e.g., \u039b</p>Oxynex 2004). Such antioxidants are with compounds of</p>Formula I or Ia in such compositions usually in weight percent ratios in the range of 1000: 1 to 1: 1000, preferably used in weight percent ratios of 100: 1 to 1: 100.</p>The preparations according to the invention can be used as further ingredients</p>Contain vitamins. Preference is given to vitamins and vitamin derivatives selected from vitamin A, vitamin A propionate, vitamin A palmitate, vitamin A acetate, retinol, vitamin B, thiamin chloride hydrochloride (vitamin Bi), riboflavin (vitamin B <sub>2</sub> ), nicotinamide, Vitamin C (ascorbic acid), vitamin D, ergocalciferol (vitamin D <sub>2</sub> ), vitamin E, DL-\u03b1-tocopherol, tocopherol-E-acetate, tocopherol hydrogen succinate, vitamin Ki, esculin  (Vitamin P active ingredient), thiamine (vitamin Bi) <sub>1</sub> nicotinic acid (niacin), pyridoxine, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine (vitamin <sub>B6),</sub> pantothenic acid, biotin, folic acid and cobalamin (vitamin B <sub>2)</sub> present in the inventive cosmetic preparations , more preferably vitamin C and its derivatives, DL-\u03b1-tocopherol, tocopherol-E-acetate, nicotinic acid, pantothenic acid and biotin. Vitamins are used with compounds of the formula I or Ia usually in weight percent ratios in the range of 1000: 1 to 1: 1000, preferably in weight percent ratios of 100: 1 to 1: 100.</p>Among the phenols with an antioxidant effect, the polyphenols, which are sometimes present as natural substances, are of particular interest for applications in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic or food sector. For example, the flavonoids or bioflavonoids, which are mainly known as plant dyes, frequently have an antioxidant potential. Effects of the substitution pattern of mono- and dihydoxy flavones are dealt with by K. Lemanska, H. Szymusiak, B. Tyrakowska, R. Zielinski, I. M. C. M. Rietjens; Current Topics in Biophysics 2000, 24 (2), 101-108. It is observed there that dihydroxyflavones having an OH group adjacent to the keto function or OH groups in the 3'4 'or 6,7 or 7,8 position have antioxidant properties, while other mono- and dihydroxyflavones have in part no antioxidant properties exhibit.</p>Quercetin (cyanidanol, cyanidolone 1522, meletin, sophoretine, ericin, 3,3 ', 4', 5,7-"
