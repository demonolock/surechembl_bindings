    "d the CAR is expressed in Treg cells in the human subject.</p>In some embodiments, the disease or disorder is an inflammatory disease, an autoimmune disease, an allergic disease, or an organ transplantation condition (e.g., graft rejection or graft-versus-host disease).</p>The invention also provides a chimeric antigen receptor or immune cell population described herein for use as a medicament.</p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSFIG. 1 depicts a schematic view of CD19-CAR, CD20-CAR, and IL-23R-CAR constructs. The CARs comprise a human CD8 leader sequence (CD8), optionally a hemagglutinin tag (HA), an scFv sequence (anti-CD19, anti-CD20, or anti-IL-23R), optionally a streptavidin tag (Tag), a hinge domain (linker), a transmembrane domain (TNFR2 or CD8), a costimulatory intracellular signaling domain (4-IBB or TNFR2) and CD3 zeta (CD3\u03b6). The CAR construct is in frame with a P2A-GFP coding sequence.</p>FIG. 2 depicts flow cytometry dot plots showing transduction efficiency and CAR expression at the cell surface of Tregs. Transduction efficiency was assessed by GFP expression and CAR expression was assessed by HA expression for CD19-CAR (CD8TM/4-1BB or TNFR2) or protein L staining for CD20-CAR (CD8TM/4-1BB or TNFR2). MFI: Mean Fluorescence Intensity.</p>FIG. 3 shows the Western blot analysis of CAR expression in human Tregs transduced with a CD20-CAR (CD8TM/4-1BB or TNFR2) or untransduced (\u201cBlank\u201d). Staining with CD3 zeta specific antibody revealed the endogenous CD3 zeta at 16 kD, the CD20-CAR (CD8TM/4-1BB) at \u02dc62 kD, and the CD20-CAR (TNFR2) at 82 kD (Panel A, upper left). The membrane was then washed and reprobed with \u03b2-actin antibody as a loading control (Panel A, lower left). Band intensity was quantified using Image J and results are shown from two different donors in Panel B.</p>FIG. 4 depicts histograms showing that TNFR2-derived CARs maintain CAR-specific activation. At Day 9, transduced FoxP3 Tregs were seeded alone or in the presence of anti-CD3/anti-CD28 coated beads, or in the presence of freshly thawed autologous B cells. After 24 h, CD19-CARs (upper left), CD20-CARs (upper right), and IL-23R-CARs (lower) were stained for CD4 and CD69 cell surface expression. Error bars represent mean\u00b1SEM. CTRL: Treg cells not transduced with a CAR.</p>FIG. 5 is a graph showing that TNFR2-derived CARs exhibit efficient CAR-mediated suppressive activity. Contact-dependent suppression mediated by CD19-CAR Tregs (Panel A), CD20-CAR Tregs (Panel B), or IL-23R-CAR Tregs (Panel C) in the absence of any activation (dotted lines) or after B cell-induced CAR activation (solid lines) was evaluated by measuring the proliferation of conventional T cells (Tconv) using flow cytometry. Circle lines represent CD8TM/4-1BB CAR constructs and square lines represent TNFR2 CAR constructs. Error bars represent mean\u00b1SEM.</p>FIG. 6 depicts a schematic view of CD19-CAR constructs of the invention. The CAR comprises a human CD8 leader sequence (CD8), an scFv sequence (anti-CD19), a streptavidin tag (Tag), a hinge domain (linker), a transmembrane dom",
    "p>CD25<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs, Tr1 cells, Th3 cells and others) arise outside the thymus. One way to induce Tregs is by exposure of T effector cells to IL-10 or TGF-\u03b2. T cells may also be converted to Treg cells by transfection or transduction of the FoxP3 gene into a mixed population of T cells. A T cell that is induced to express FoxP3 adopts the Treg phenotype and such recombinant Tregs are also defined herein as \u201cTregs\u201d.</p>The term \u201crejection\u201d refers to a state in which a transplanted organ or tissue is not accepted by the body of the recipient. Rejection results from the recipient's immune system attacking the transplanted organ or tissue. Rejection can occur days to weeks after transplantation (acute) or months to years after transplantation (chronic).</p>As used herein, an antibody or a CAR is said to be \u201cimmunospecific for,\u201d \u201cspecific for\u201d or to \u201cspecifically bind\u201d an antigen if it reacts at a detectable level with the antigen, e.g., with an affinity constant, Ka, of greater than or equal to about 10<sup>4</sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>, greater than or equal to about 10<sup>5</sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>, greater than or equal to about 10<sup>6</sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>, greater than or equal to about 10<sup>7 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>, greater than or equal to 10<sup>8 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>, greater than or equal to 10<sup>9 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>, or greater than or equal to 10<sup>10 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>. Affinity of an antibody for its cognate antigen is also commonly expressed as a dissociation constant Kd, and in certain embodiments, an antibody specifically binds to antigen if it binds with a Kd of less than or equal to 10<sup>\u22124 </sup>M, less than or equal to about 10<sup>\u22125 </sup>M, less than or equal to about 10<sup>\u22126</sup>M, less than or equal to 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, less than or equal to 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, less than or equal to 5\u00d710<sup>\u22129 </sup>M, or less than or equal to 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>M, or less than or equal to 5\u00d710<sup>\u221210 </sup>M, or less than or equal to 10<sup>\u221210 </sup>M. Affinities of antibodies or CARs can readily be determined using conventional techniques, for example, those described by Scatchard et al., (Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. USA 51:660 (1949)). Binding properties of an antibody to antigens, cells or tissues thereof may generally be determined and assessed using immunodetection methods including, for example, immunofluorescence-based assays, such as immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). In some embodiments, the term \u201cspecifically binds\u201d refers to an antibody, a CAR or a ligand, that recognizes and binds with a binding partner present in a sample, but that does not substantially recognize or bind other molecules in the sample.</p>The term \u201csignal transduction pathway\u201d refers to the biochemical relationship between a variety of signal transduction molecules that play a role in the transmission of a signal from one portion of a cell to another portion of a cell.</p>The term \u201csignaling domain\u201d refers to a functional portion of a protein that acts by transmitting information within the cell to regulate cellular",

Furthermore, the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) representing the number of CARs per cell was decreased about 15-fold for CD19-CAR (TNFR2), about 6-fold for CD20-CAR (TNFR2), and about 9-fold for IL-23R-CAR (TNFR2). This strong decrease of the CAR expression at the cell surface was not the consequence of lower transduction efficiency since GFP expression was comparable in all of the experimental conditions.</p>Moreover, as shown in FIG. 3, Panel A, cells transduced with CD20-CAR (CD8TM/4-1BB) expressed a 62 kD protein corresponding to the CAR after staining with CD3\u03b6 antibody and a 82 kD protein for cells transduced with CD20-CAR (TNFR2), while untransduced cells were only labeled with a band at 16 kD corresponding to the endogenous CD3\u03b6. Interestingly, quantitation of band intensity revealed a lower expression of CD20-CAR (TNFR2) compared to CD20-CAR (CD8TM/4-1BB) (FIG. 3, Panel B) as observed using flow cytometry (FIG. 2).</p>In summary, the results demonstrated that the TNFR2 intracellular domain and TNFR2 transmembrane domain surprisingly led to a reduced global expression of the CAR, especially at the cell surface.</p>CAR-Specific ActivationA complete reduction of antigen-independent tonic signaling is observed in Treg cells transduced with CARs comprising TNFR2 domains for the three different scFv targets (CD19, CD20, and IL-23R) as compared to classical 4-1BB/CD3 constructs (FIG. 4, Panels A-C). Furthermore, despite a strong reduction in TNFR2-derived CAR expression (CD19, CD20, or IL-23R) at the cell surface (Table 3), the CAR-specific activation is maintained.</p>Thus, these results demonstrate that the presence of a TNFR2 transmembrane and TNFR2 intracellular domain surprisingly led to a strong reduction of the activation background in CAR Treg cells and consequently increased the ratio between CAR specific activation and ligand-independent tonic signaling. This phenomenon is independent of the scFv of interest since three different scFvs were tested and behaved in the same manner (CD19, CD20, and IL-23R).</p>CAR-Mediated Suppressive ActivityFor the CD19-CAR construct harboring TNFR2-derived domains, a CAR-specific triggering of suppressive activity comparable"
