    "iological sample\" refers to anything, which may contain the cells of interest (e.g., cancer or tumor cells thereof) for which the screening method or treatment is desired. The sample may be a biological sample, such as a biological fluid or a biological tissue. In one embodiment, a biological sample is a tissue sample including pulmonary arterial endothelial cells. Such a sample may include diverse cells, proteins, and genetic material. Examples of biological tissues also include organs, tumors, lymph nodes, arteries and individual cell(s). Examples of biological fluids include urine, blood, plasma, serum, saliva, semen, stool, sputum, cerebral spinal fluid, tears, mucus, amniotic fluid or the like. </p> By \"shRNA\" is meant sequences of RNA that make a tight hairpin that can be used to silence target gene expression via RNA interference (RNAi). Expression of the shRNA in cells can be obtained by delivery of plasmids or viral or bacterial vectors. </p> By \"siRNA\" is meant double stranded RNA molecules, usually around 20-30 nucleotides in length, that are capable of interfering in gene expression. The siRNA molecules may have regions that are complementary to specific genes that decrease translation of these genes. </p> The term \"small molecule\" refers to a peptide having about 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,</p>15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 amino acids with the capacity to bind a target, such as a molecule, or antigen. The small molecule comprises a low molar mass, such as less than about 12 kD, 11 kD, 10 kD, 9 kD, 8 kD, 7 kD, 6 kD, 5 kD, or any molar mass therebetween or less. In some embodiments, the small molecule is a small molecule extracellular domain of an affinity molecule chimeric receptor. In some embodiments, the small molecule is a small molecule binding domain of a bispecific affinity molecule. Small molecule may be characterized by their ability to bind a target and their structure. In some embodiments, the small molecule comprises at least one helix, \n\n such an alpha-helix, or two helices, three helices or more. The small molecule may also be chemically inert and withstand high temperatures, such as 85\u00b0C or higher. </p> By the term \"specifically binds,\" as used herein with respect to an antibody, is meant an antibody which recognizes a specific antigen, but does not substantially recognize or bind other molecules in a sample. For example, an antibody that specifically binds to an antigen from one species may also bind to that antigen from one or more species. But, such cross-species reactivity does not itself alter the classification of an antibody as specific. In another example, an antibody that specifically binds to an antigen may also bind to different allelic forms of the antigen. However, such cross reactivity does not itself alter the classification of an antibody as specific. In some instances, the terms \"specific binding\" or \"specifically binding,\" can be used in reference to the interaction of an antibody, a protein, or a peptide with a second chemical species, to mean that the int"
