The compounds are dissolved in 100% DMSO and diluted with the appropriate buffer to a 5% final DMSO concentration. The inhibitory activity is expressed in percent inhibition relative to DMSO control. The concentration at which compound inhibits reverse transcriptase by 50% is expressed as the IC<sub>5</sub>o of the compound.</p>\n  The compounds of Examples 8 and 17, when tested according to the above procedure, had IC50 values of, respectively, 10 and 64 nanomolar. \n\n</p>\n  Thus the invention provides:</p>\n  (i) a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or derivative thereof; (ii) a process for the preparation of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or derivative thereof; (iii) a pharmaceutical composition including a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or derivative thereof, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, diluent or carrier; (iv) a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or composition thereof, for use as a medicament; (v) a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or composition thereof, for use as a reverse transcriptase inhibitor or modulator; (vi) a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or composition thereof, for use in the treatment of an HIV or genetically- related retroviral infection, or a resulting acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS); (vii) a use of the compound of formula (I) or of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or composition thereof, for the manufacture of a medicament having reverse transcriptase inhibitory or modulating activity; (viii) the use of a compound of formula (I) or of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or composition thereof, for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of an HIV or genetically-related retr"
