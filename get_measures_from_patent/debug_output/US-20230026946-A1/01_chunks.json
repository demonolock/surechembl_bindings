    "ssay cells pre-seeded in in white opaque 96-well microplates or half-well microplates (Corning) according to the manufacturer recommendations. Assay buffer alone and cells without treatment were used as negative controls, while IL-2 alone was used as a positive control. The plates were covered and incubated for 6 hours in a humidified incubator (37\u00b0 C., 5% CO<sub>2</sub>). After incubation, 75 \u03bcL Bio-Glo reagent (Promega) was added, incubated for 10 minutes and the bioluminescence was read using a plate reader (Tecan M200 Pro). Data was plotted in Prism (GraphPad) and ED50 was calculated by non-linear fit.</p>Example 5. General Procedure for SDS-PAGE Analysis of FormulationMicelle-IL-2 formulations were evaluated by SDS-PAGE to confirm IL-2 loading into micelles and IL-2 integrity. Samples were prepared to target 100-200 ng protein loaded per lane. For characterization of IL-2 loaded formulation purification by FPLC, the load sample constitutes the crude formulation without any purification, the spun load samples constitutes the formulation after purification by high-speed centrifugation to clear aggregates and large particles, the micelle pool is prepared by combining fractions containing micelles and the free IL-2 sample contains fractions containing unencapsulated protein. Formulation samples were diluted in 4\u00d7 Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad) with or without \u03b2-mercaptoethanol depending on the reducing requirements and denatured at 65\u00b0 C. for 5 minutes. Samples were loaded in Any kD\u2122 or 4-20% SDS-PAGE gradient Mini-Protean gels (Bio-Rad) by stacking at 50V for 30 minutes followed by separating at 100V for 90 minutes. Detection of IL-2 was performed by Simply Blue Stain (Invitrogen). IL-2 was also determined by western blot after transfer to 0.2 \u03bcm nitrocellulose membrane by probing with anti IL-2 Ab clone (Cell Signaling Technology, Clone D7A5, 1:4000 dilution) followed by HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary (LI-COR, 1:2000 dilution) and detected by ECL reagent (Pierce) and chemiluminescence was captured with ChemiDoc MP imager (Bio-Rad). Image processing and densitometry analysis was performed using ImageLab (Bio-Rad). If required, quantitation of IL-2 was performed by fitting to an IL-2 standard curve.</p>Example 6.
