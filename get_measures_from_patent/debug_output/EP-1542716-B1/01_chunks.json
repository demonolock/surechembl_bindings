In different embodiments a ghrelin analog has at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, or at least about 90%, functional activity relative to ghrelin as determined using one or more of the Functional Activity assays described below; and/or has an IC<sub>50</sub> greater than about 1,000 nM, greater than about 100 nM, or greater than about 50 nM, using the Receptor Binding assay described below. With respect to IC<sub>50</sub>, greater refers to potency and thus indicates a lesser amount is needed to achieve binding inhibition.</p>Assays measuring the ability of a compound to bind a GHS receptor employ a GHS receptor, a fragment of the receptor comprising a ghrelin binding site, a polypeptide comprising such a fragment, or a derivative of the polypeptide. Preferably, the assay uses the GHS receptor or a fragment thereof. A polypeptide comprising a GHS receptor fragment that binds ghrelin can also contain one or more polypeptide regions not found in a GHS receptor. A derivative of such a polypeptide comprises a GHS receptor fragment that binds ghrelin along with one or more non-peptide components.</p>The GHS receptor amino acid sequence involved in binding can be readily identified using labeled ghrelin orghrelIn structural or functional analogs and different receptor fragments. Different strategies can be employed to select fragments to be tested to narrow down the binding region. Examples of such strategies include testing consecutive fragments about 15 amino acids in length starting at the N-terminus, and testing longer length fragments. If longer length fragments are tested, a fragment binding ghrelin can be subdivided to further locate the ghrelin binding region. Fragments used for binding studies can be generated using recombinant nucleic acid techniques.</p>Binding assays can be performed using individual compounds or preparations containing different numbers of compounds of the present invention. A preparation containing different numbers of compounds of the invention having the ability to bind to the GHS receptor can be divided into smaller groups of compounds that can be tested to identify the compound(s) binding to the GHS receptor. In an embodiment of the present invention, a test preparation containing at least 10 compounds is used in a binding assay.</p>Binding assays can be performed using recombinantly produced GHS receptor polypeptides present in different environments. Such environments include, for example, cell extracts and purified cell extracts containing the GHS receptor polypeptide expressed from recombinant nucleic acid or naturally occurring nucleic acid; and also include, for example, the use of a purified GHS receptor polypeptide produced by recombinant means or from naturally occurring nucleic acid which is introduced into a different environment.</p>Screening for GHS Receptor Active CompoundsScreening for GHS receptor active compounds is facilitated using a recombinantly expressed receptor. Using a recombinantly expressed GHS receptor offers several advantages such as the ability to express the receptor in a defined cell system so that a response to a compound at the GHS receptor can more readily be differentiated from responses at other receptors. For example, the GHS receptor can be expressed in a cell line such as HEK 293, COS 7, and CHO not normally expressing the receptor by an expression vector, wherein the same cell line without the expression vector can act as a control.</p>Screening for compounds reducing GHS receptor activity is facilitated through the use of a ghrelin functional analog in the assay. The use of a ghrelin functional analog in a screening assay provides for GHS receptor activity. The effect of test compounds on such activity can be measured to identify, for example, ",

The BMI \"normal\" range for humans is generally considered to be 19-22. \"Normal\" weight ranges are well known in the art and take into account factors such as a subject age, height, and body type.</p>Biological Assays - Examples1. Receptor Binding AssayA. Preparation of CHO-K1 cells expressing the human recombinant GHS receptorThe cDNA for human growth hormone secretagogue receptor (hGHS-R, or ghrelin receptor) was cloned by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) using human brain RNA as a template (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), gene specific primers flanking the full-length coding sequence of hGHS-R, (S: 5'- A T G T G G A A C G C G A C G C C C A G C G A A G A G - 3' (SEQ ID NO:1) and AS: 5'- T C A T G T A T T A A T A C T A G A T T C T G T C C A - 3') (SEQ ID NO:2), and Advantage 2 PCR Kit (Clontech). The PCR product was cloned into the pCR2.1 vector using Original TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The full length human GHS-R was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen). The plasmid was transfected into the Chinese hamster ovary cell line, CHO-K1 (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD), by calcium phosphate method (Wigler, M et al., Cell 11, 223, 1977). Single cell clones stably expressing the hGHS-R were obtained by selecting transfected cells grown in cloning rings in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and 1 mM sodium pyruvate containing 0.8 mg/ml G418 (Gibco, Grand Island, NY).</p>B. GHS-R Binding Assay:Membranes for radioligand binding studies can be and were prepared by homogenization of the foregoing CHO-K1 cells expressing the human recombinant GHS receptor in 20 ml of ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl with a Brinkman Polytron (Westbury, NY) (setting 6, 15 sec). The homogenates were washed twice by centrifugation (39,000 g / 10 min), and the final pellets were resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl, containing 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.1 % BSA. For assay, aliquots (0.4 ml) were incubated with 0.05 nM (<sup>125</sup>I)ghrelin (-2000 Ci/mmol, Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA), with and without 0.05 ml of unlabeled competing test compounds of the invention. After a 60 min incubation (4\u00b0C), the bound (<sup>125</sup>I)ghrelin was separated from the free by rapid filtration through GF/C filters (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD), which had been previously soaked in 0.5% polyethyleneimine/0.1 % BSA. The filters were then washed three times with 5-ml aliquots of ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and the bound radioactivity trapped on the filters was counted by gamma spectrometry (Wallac LKB, Gaithersburg, MD). Specific binding was defined as the total (<sup>125</sup>I)ghrelin bound minus that bound in the presence of 1000 nM ghrelin (Bachem, Torrence, CA).</p>2. GHS-R Functional Activity AssaysA.
