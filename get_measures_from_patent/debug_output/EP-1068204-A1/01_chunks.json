Neurol. Neurosur\u03b1. Psychiatry. 1992 55 (9) 768-73]. This method enables a physician to reliably detect a parameter that seems to correlate at least in a number of cases with pathologic depression. However, treatment with anti- depressant drugs is not reflected in changes of the rCBF, which means that a therapeutic effect can not be monitored by this method.</p>\n  The study of serotonine re-uptake sites using emission tomography requires the use of radioligands which have desirable properties for in vivo receptor imaging. These criteria include ease of labelling with positron-emitting radionucleotides, low rates of peripheral metabolism, high selectivity for brain regions holding the neuroreceptor of interest, and relatively high specific/non-specific binding ratios. Despite the development of a number of radioligands for the serotonine transporter, none of these compounds satisfactorily meet all the criteria desired for an ideal ligand.</p>\n  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n\n The compounds and their derivatives of this invention are the first substances known that specifically bind to serotonine transporters. This allows for the first time to reliably determine the number of serotonine binding sites and related Kd values and the release of serotonine as well as the detection of changes in the serotonine metabolism in response to therapeutic drugs.</p>\n  It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a compound which can be used to diagnose diseases or disorders that are related to changes in the serotonine levels in vivo and in vitro and which can be used as well to monitor the effect of a therapy. Further, it is an object of the present invention to provide methods for diagnosing several disorders linked to decreased or increased neurotransmission of serotonine in vivo and in vitro using a specific detectable compound.</p>\n  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</p>\n  The present invention is further illustrated by reference to the accompanying drawing, in which:</p>\n  Fig. 1 shows a characteristic PET scan illustrating the unique and very specific uptake and labelling of serotonine nerve terminals (containing the serotonine reuptake transporter) by Compound (3-4) of the invention; A coronal (left), transaxial (centre) and sagittal (right) section of a pig brain labelled with Compound (3-4). Accumulation of the compound can be seen in the medial mesecephalon (the serotonergic Raphe nuclei) and in the diecephalon (the thalamus and basal ganglia).</p>\n  DETAILED DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</p>\n  It is an object of the present invention to provide a compound which can be used to diagnose diseases or disorders that are related to changes in the serotonine levels in vivo and ",
    "ease of a living human or animal body, which disorder or disease is responsive to the inhibition or monoamine neurotransmitter re-uptake, comprising the steps of (a) administering to said body a diagnostically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) in its labelled or unlabeiled form,</p>\n  (b) detecting said compound and determining the distribution thereon in at least a part of said body by physical methods, and</p>\n  (c) comparing the obtained data with control data. The pharmaceutical composition, which is preferably used in the in-vitro method of the present invention, can be provided in the form of an assay kit system wherein said pharmaceutical composition comprises either a labelled or unlabeiled compound of formula (I) in unit-dosage form in a suitable container. Preferably, said unit dosage is adjusted to be sufficient for analysing one blood sample according to the in-vitro method of the invention. Furthermore, said assay kit of the present invention can further comprise a stabilising composition. The stabilising composition can be selected from antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, or from buffers of weak acid- base composition e.g. phosphate buffers or from various types of cyclodextrins e.g. hydroxypropyl \u03b2-cyclodextrin. The compounds and their derivatives of this invention are the first substances known that specifically bind to serotonine transporters. This allows for the first time to reliably determine the number of serotonine binding sites and related Kd values and the release of serotonine as well as the detection of changes in the serotonine metabolism in response to therapeutic drugs. Furthermore, a labelled compound of formula (I) may also be used in the analysis and adjustment of the treatment of patients having a lower level of serotonine \n\nre-uptake as compared to the normal level with serotonine uptake inhibitors. In this context, the compounds of the invention can be employed to assess whether the dosage of serotonine re-uptake inhibitors given is sufficient to occupy a high number of the serotonine transporter sites thereby blocking the re-uptake of serotonine and extending their presence and action within the synaptic cleft. The labelled compound of the invention can likewise be used to investigate whether an unnecessary high dose is given thereby blocking too many serotonine transporter sites and/or increasing the risk of unwanted side-effects. If a compound is given in a sufficient dose whereby maximal blocking of serotonine re-uptake is achieved, then higher doses will only increase the risk of side effects.</p>\n  Fig. 1 is a characteristic PET scan showing the unique and very specific uptake and labelling of serotonine nerve terminals (containing the serotonine reuptake transporter) by Compound (3-4).</p>\n  EXAMPLES</p>\n  The invention is further illustrated with reference to the following examples which are not intended to be in any way limiting to the scope of the invention as claimed.</p>\n  Example 1</p>\n"
