The inhibition against trypsin is contradictory to the results described above. However, since the method using synthetic fluorescent substrates is superior to the casein Folin method in accuracy, the results of the latter measurement was taken and it was judged that Kexstatin has inhibitory activity against trypsin.</p>From the results described above, Kexstatin inhibits not only Kex2 proteinase family enzymes but also subtilisin and trypsin which are also serine proteinases. However, Kexstatin does not inhibit chymotrypsin (a serine proteinase) nor thermolysin and pepsin belonging to other type of proteinase. On the other hand, SSI which is a proteinaceous inhibitor against subtilisin inhibits subtilisin specifically and does not inhibit Kex2 proteinase, trypsin, chymotrypsin, thermolysin nor pepsin.</p>The inhibitory activity of various concentrations of Kexstatin against Kex2 proteinase was examined by the method described in Example 1 (FIG. 4). The results show a typical pattern of antagonistic inhibition. The amount of Kexstatin which inhibits the activity of 1 \u03bcg of Kex2 proteinase by 50% (IC50) is calculated to be 1.4 \u03bcg. Considering the molecular weights of both substances, Kexstatin can be said an extremely strong inhibitor like SSI described above.</p>EXAMPLE 5Determination of the Amino Acid Sequences for the Amino Terminal of Kexstatin and Trypsin-Digested PeptidesPurified Kexstatin was electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel (15%) and transferred to a PVDF (polyvinylidene difluoride) membrane. After the membrane was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250, the portion corresponding to Kexstatin was cut out and the sequence of its amino terminal was determined directly with an automated peptide sequencer (Perkin Elmer/Applied Biosystems 476A). The amino acid sequence for the 19 residues from the amino terminal was determined as follows.</p>Gly-Leu-Tyr-Ala-Pro-Thr-Glu-Leu-Val-Leu-Thr-Val-Gly-Gln-Gly-Glu-Ser-Arg-Ala</p>Kexstatin (100 mg) was incubated in a solution containing 1 mg of trypsin and 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) at 37\u00b0 C. for 3 hr and then fractionated by high performance liquid chromatography (Gilson). The column used was Aquapore Butyl (Brownlee, 2.1 mm\u00d7220 mm) and was eluted by acetonitrile linear gradients in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The absorbances at 220 nm and 280 nm were measured. Each of the peaks at 220 nm (TP1-TP5) were recovered, concentrated and dried. Then, the amino acid sequence for each peak was determined with an automated peptide sequencer (Perkin Elmer/Applied Biosystems 492). TP2 was subjected to chromatography again"
