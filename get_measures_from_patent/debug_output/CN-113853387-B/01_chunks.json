    "idues in the VL are numbered 26-32 (LCDR 1), 50-52 (LCDR 2) and 91-96 (LCDR 3), the CDRs are defined by combining the Kabat and Chothia definitions of the human CDRs from amino acid residues 26-35 (HCDR 1), 65-65 (HCDR 1) and 95-96 (LCDR 1) and 24-102 (LCDR 3) 50-56 (LCDR 2) and 89-97 (LCDR 3). Following the rules of IMGT, the CDR amino acid residue numbers in VH are approximately 26-35 (CDR 1), 51-57 (CDR 2), and 93-102 (CDR 3), and the CDR amino acid residue numbers in VL are approximately 27-32 (CDR 1), 50-52 (CDR 2), and 89-97 (CDR 3). Following the IMGT rules, the CDR regions of the antibody can be determined using the program IMGT/DomainGap Align.</p>The term \"epitope\" or \"antigenic determinant\" refers to a site on an antigen to which an immunoglobulin or antibody specifically binds (e.g., a specific site on a TSLP molecule). Epitopes typically comprise at least 3,4,5,6,7,8,9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 or 15 contiguous or non-contiguous amino acids in a unique spatial conformation. See, e.g., epipope Mapping Protocols in Methods in Molecular B biology, volume 66, g.e. morris, ed. (1996).</p>The terms \"specific binding,\" \"selective binding,\" \"selectively binds,\" and \"specifically binds\" refer to the binding of an antibody to an epitope on a predetermined antigen. Typically, the antibody is administered at a rate of about less than 10 <sup>-8</sup> M, e.g. less than about 10 <sup>-9</sup> M\u300110 <sup>-</sup><sup>10</sup> M\u300110 <sup>-11</sup> M\u300110 <sup>-12</sup> M or less affinity (KD) binding.</p>The term \"KD\" refers to the dissociation equilibrium constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction. Typically, the antibodies of the present disclosure are administered at less than about 10 <sup>-7</sup> M, e.g. less than about 10 <sup>-8</sup> M or 10 <sup>-9</sup> The dissociation equilibrium constant (KD) of M binds to TSLP, e.g., in the present disclosure the affinity of an antibody to a cell surface antigen is determined by FACS or Biacore methods for KD values.</p>The term \"compete\" when used in the context of antigen binding proteins that compete for the same epitope (e.g., neutralizing antigen binding proteins or neutralizing antibodies) means competition between antigen binding proteins, as determined by the following assay: in such assays, the antigen binding protein to be detected (e.g., an antibody or immunologically functional fragment thereof) prevents or inhibits (e.g., reduces) specific binding of a reference antigen binding protein (e.g., a ligand or a reference antibody) to a common antigen (e.g., a TSLP antigen or fragment thereof). Numerous types of competitive binding assays are available for determining whether an antigen binding protein competes with another, such as: solid phase direct or indirect Radioimmunoassays (RIA), solid phase direct or indirect Enzyme Immunoassays (EIA), sandwich competition assays (see, e.g., stahli et al, 1983, methods in Enzymology 9; solid phase direct biotin-avidin EIA (see, e.g., kirkland et al, 1986, J.Immunol.137, 3614-3619), solid phase direct labeling assay, solid phase direct labeling sandwich assay (see, e.g., harlow and Lane,1988, antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, cold Spring Harbor Press); direct labeling of RIA with a solid phase of I-125 label (see, e.g., morel et al, 1988, mol. Immunol.25; solid phase direct biotin-avidin EIA (see, e.g., cheung, et al, 1990, virology 176; and direct-labeled RIA (Moldenhauer et al, 1990, scand. J. Immunol.32. Typically, the assay i",
