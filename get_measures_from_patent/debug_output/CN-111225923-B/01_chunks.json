    "synuclein\" pathway. Prior art (Roberts H.L., brown D.R.,2015,Biomolecules 5:282-305; available website: mdpi.com/2218-273X/5/2/282). </p>Figure 2A shows thioflavin assay results associated with formation of \u03b2 -sheet structures of \u03b1 -synuclein after incubation with various inactive monomers, inactive polymers, active monomers, active polymers, and combinations thereof. Left bar note: after incubation for 1 hour (37 \u2103) fluorescence values were determined; right bar note: fluorescence values were determined after 24 hours incubation (37 \u2103) (see examples for details). Figure 2B shows confocal images of rat primary cortical cells incubated with either inactive polymer (prepared with alpha synuclein monomer in the absence of endotoxin) or active polymer (prepared in the presence of endotoxin). Fluorescence for detection of lewy body pathology using serine 129 phosphorylation specific antibodies assay. Hoechst: DAPI staining; pser129,129: FITC-labeled serine 129 phosphorylation-specific antibodies. Fig. 2C shows electron microscope images of active human \u03b1 -synuclein fibrils (upper panel) and inactive human \u03b1 -synuclein fibrils (lower panel). Bar column: 100nm.</p>FIG. 3A shows Western blot analysis of mouse brain lysates probed with clone 2F11. Left pass: a marker (kDa); right pathway clone 2F11. Clone 2F11 was used to identify high molecular weight bands in mouse brain lysates. FIG. 3B shows Western blot analysis of mouse brain lysates probed with clone 4F 1. Left pass: a marker (kD); right-hand pathway clone 4F1 was used to identify low molecular weight bands in mouse brain lysates. FIG. 3C shows Western blotting of mouse brain lysates probed with clone 3F8. Left pass: marker (kDa) right pathway clone 3F8. Clone 3F8 was used to identify low molecular weight bands in mouse brain lysates. FIG. 3D shows a HeLa lysate Western blot analysis (known to produce alpha-synuclein, see URL: proteoplas. Org/ENSG 00000145335-SNCA/cell) probed with clone 2F11. Left pass: a marker (kDa); right pathway clone 2F11. Clone 2F11 was used to identify high molecular weight bands in mouse brain lysates.</p>FIG. 4 shows protein staining of the mouse brain lysate used in FIGS. 3A-3C. Left pass: a marker (kDa); ponceau staining of mouse brain lysates.</p>Figure 5A shows western blot analysis of immunoprecipitated mouse brain lysates probed with clone 2F 11. The oligomeric band molecular weight of the alpha-synuclein is approximately 60-70kDa. Left pass: a marker (kDa); an intermediate passage: blank; right path: mouse brain lysate. Figure 5B shows western blot analysis of immunoprecipitated mouse brain lysate effluents probed using clone 2F 11. An oligomeric band of about 60-70kDa of alpha-synuclein, one trimeric band of alpha-synuclein and a monomeric band of alpha-synuclein are shown. Left pass: a marker (kDa); right path: mouse brain lysate.</p>FIG. 6 shows an alignment of nucleic acid sequences of mouse alpha-synuclein (upper sequence; 055043; SEQ ID NO: 1) and human alpha"
