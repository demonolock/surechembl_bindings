For example, if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the selective culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT medium), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.</p>\n  Preferred fusion partner myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level production of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a selective medium that selects against the unfused parental cells. Preferred myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines, such as those derived from MOPC-21 and MPC-11 mouse tumors available from the SaIk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, California USA, and SP-2 and derivatives e.g., X63-Ag8-653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Maryland USA. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor, J. Immunol.,</p>\n  133:3001 (1984); and Brodeur et ai, Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987)).</p>\n  Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).</p>\n  The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis described in Munson et al., Anal. Biochem., 107:220 (1980). \n\n Once hybridoma cells that produce antibodies of the desired specificity, affinity, and/or activity are identified, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, pp.59-103 (Academic Press, 1986)). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, D-MEM or RPMI- 1640 medium. In addition, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal e.g, by i.p. injection of the cells into mice. The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium, ascites fluid, or serum by conventional antibody purification procedures such as, for example, affinity chromatography (e.g.. using protein A or protein G-Sepharose) or ion-exchange chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, etc.</p>\n  DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures {e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be ",
    "tch\u03ca<sup>1'</sup> tissue \n\nappeared more crowded with denser chromatin The phenotypes in the anterior lobes of iNotchl ' prostate were less evident than in ventral prostate These findings together demonstrate that the lack of Notch 1 slows down or prevents terminal differentiation and promotes proliferation of prostatic epithelial cells, thus, supporting the results from \u03b3-secretase inhibitor studies The changes in organ morphology induced by Notch 1 deficiency are commonly seen in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), a precursor lesion to prostate cancer</p>\n  Example 5 Increased immature cell population and enhanced proliferation in the prostatic epithelium of Notch 1 inducible knockout mice</p>\n  The phenotypes of prostate epithelial cells, particularly those clustered focally in the epitheha of iNotchl ' prostate were examined further Overall, CK8 and CK14 staining was highly specific in control wild type tissue at this stage, with Ib 9% of epithelial cells that co-expressed CK8 and CK14 In contrast, the percentage of CK8/CK14-coexpressing epithelial cells increased to 70 0% in the iNotchl <sup>f</sup> prostate (Fig 6C) More importantly the focal clusters of cells in iNotchl ' prostate epitheha expressed both CK8 and CK14 (Fig 6A-B), indicative of a progenitor phenotype It was this cell population that was responsible for the increase in percentage of CK8/CK14-coexpressing epithelial cells To determine whether this alteration was due to enhanced cell proliferation, Ki-67 immunostaining was performed In contrast to the low proliferation detected in the epitheha of control mice, which was expected for 7-8 weeks old mice, proliferation in iNotch <sup>1</sup> mice prostate was significantly enhanced (Fig 7) These results show that inactivation of Notch 1 signaling caused over-proliferation of progenitor cells in prostate which resulted in phenotypes that resemble neoplastic lesions</p>\n  Example 6 Notch 1 and Hev-1 are dow n-regulated in human prostate adenocarcinomas</p>\n  The suppressive role of Notch 1 signaling on prostate growth and neoplastic transformation identified in these models is consistent with the previous study with human prostate cancer cell lines where it was shown that exogenous expression of a constitutively active form of Notchl inhibits proliferation of prostate cancer cell lines DU145, LNCaP and PC3 (Shou et al , Cancer Res 61 7291-7297 (2001)) To further determine the clinical relevance of these findings, we examined the expression of Notchl pathway genes in a Gene Logic database, which includes data from large sets of microarray analyses on various diseased human tissues, including tumors, as well as respective normal control tissue samples Strikingly, we found that the Notchl gene and one of the downstream target genes, Hey-1, were down-regulated significantly in prostate adenocarcinomas As shown in Fig 8, the mean expression level of Notchl in 51 prostate adenocarcinoma samples was significantly lower than normal "
