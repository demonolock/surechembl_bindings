{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nChondroitin sulfate, as its name indicates, carries sulphate groups on the unit \"N-acetylglucosamine\" with a Ki value of 10 uM.\n\n\nNone of the sentences in the provided text meet the criteria of containing a specific molecule name, a bioactivity metric (IC50, Ki, Kd, EC50), a specific numeric value for that metric, and a unit for that value. The sentence mentioning Ki is incomplete and does not provide a specific numeric value and unit for a molecule. \n\nHowever, there is one sentence that mentions a concentration range for glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate:\n\n\nAccording to the bibliographical data concerning the use of the glucosamine-chondroitin combination in the articular domain, the present invention makes it possible to protect liquid compositions for the oral and topical route whose concentration glucosamine is between 0.10% and 15% and that of chondroitin sulfate between 0.06% and 12% presented in single dose, concentrations expressed by weight relative to the final mass of the composition."}
