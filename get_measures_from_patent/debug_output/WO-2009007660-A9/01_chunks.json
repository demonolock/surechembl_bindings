    "r of + 100 \u00b0 and is in the form of crystalline powder.</p>\u00a0The \u03b2-form has a melting point of 110 \u00b0 C., a rotational power of + 28 \u00b0 and is in the form of a needle.</p>Glucosamine, \u03b1 or \u03b2, the subject of the present invention is in the form of salts of hydrochloric acid, glucosamine hydrochloride, or sulfuric acid, glucosamine sulfate.</p>For chondroitin, the only possible source is extraction from a substrate of animal origin. Because of its polysaccharide nature, it is not possible to obtain it synthetically. The substrates used during the extraction consist of the cartilages of cattle (trachea) and pigs (skin, bone, etc ...) and fish (sharks, ray, etc ...).</p>The extraction protocol consists of a proteolytic treatment of these different tissues, followed by a separation and purification process. The extraction processes make it possible to obtain a polymer having on average a molecular weight of the order of 50,000. Some processes lead to lower molecular weights allowing better assimilation of the product.</p>The chondroitin sulphates selected in the present invention have a molecular weight ranging from 10,000 to 60,000.  Chondroitin sulfate, as its name indicates, carries sulphate groups on the unit \"N-acetylglucosamine\".</p>\u00a0Depending on the position of these sulphate groups, five types of chondroitin sulphate exist:</p>chondroitin 4-sulfate: chondroitin sulfate A where R 1 = SO <sub>3</sub> H and R <sub>2</sub> = H</p>chondroitin 6-sulfate: chondroitin sulfate C where Ki = H and R <sub>2</sub> = SO <sub>3</sub> H</p>chondroitin sulfate B where Ri = SO3H and <img id=\"imgf000020_0001\" path=\"imgf000020_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/103379310/WO/20100204/A9/002009/00/76/60/imgf000020_0001.tif\"/></p>chondroitin 4,6-sulfate: chondroitin sulfate E where Ri = SO3H and R <sub>2</sub> = SO <sub>3</sub> H</p>2,6 chondroitin sulfate: chondroitin sulfate D where Ri = H and R <sub>2</sub> = SO 3 H SO 3 H group and a C <sub>2</sub> on the glucuronic acid</p><img id=\"imgf000020_0002\" path=\"imgf000020_0002.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/169540842/WO/20110728/A9/002009/00/76/60/imgf000020_0002.tif\"/></p>The three main forms are A, B and C differing in their rotational power</p>\u00a0- form A: between -28 \u00b0 and -32 \u00b0</p>\u00a0- form C: between -12 \u00b0 and -18 \u00b0</p>B-form: between -60 \u00b0 and -70 \u00b0 According to the bibliographical data concerning the use of the glucosamine-chondroitin combination in the articular domain, the present invention makes it possible to protect liquid compositions for the oral and topical route whose concentration glucosamine is between 0.10% and 15% and that of chondroitin sulfate between 0.06% and 12% presented in single dose, concentrations expressed by weight relative to the final mass of the composition. The term \"single dose\" refers to packaging that allows the effective amount of active ingredients to be administered once a day.  These same compositions can be presented in multi-dose "
