    ".25:1 to about 1:1.</p>In another embodiment, a ZrOCl<sub>2 </sub>solution is added to the pH adjusted aluminum-glycine solution. In one such embodiment, the molar ratio of Al:Zr is about 8. In another such embodiment, the molar ratio of Al:Zr is about 7. In one other such embodiment, the molar ratio of Al:Zr is about 9.</p>For the above methods, the aluminum chloride salt and inorganic base may be obtained from a variety of sources. In one embodiment, the aluminum chloride salt includes aluminum trichloride, aluminum chlorohexahydrate and aluminum dichlorohydrate. In one such embodiment, the aluminum chloride salt is aluminum chlorohexahydrate.</p>In one embodiment, the inorganic base can be at least one base chosen from metal hydroxides, calcium hydroxide, strontium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, barium hydroxide, metal oxides, calcium oxide, strontium oxide, and barium oxide.</p>The present invention provides for aluminum antiperspirant active compositions and/or aluminum-zirconium antiperspirant active compositions having high levels of low molecular weight Al and Zr species. As illustrated in FIGS. 2 to 7, the high levels of low molecular weight Al and Zr species is reflected in a SEC trace that has an intense Peak 4, low Peaks 1, 2, 3 and 5. The polymerization of the antiperspirant actives in aqueous solutions and the correspondent gelation process were followed by monitoring the molecular weight profile of the polyoxohalides in time by SEC. The relative retention time (\u201cKd\u201d) for each of these peaks varies depending on the experimental conditions, but the peaks remain relative to each other. Data for Tables in the examples was obtained using an SEC chromatogram using the following parameters: Waters\u00ae 600 analytical pump and controller, Rheodyne\u00ae 77251 injector. Protein-Pak\u00ae 125 (Waters) column, Waters 2414 Refractive Index Detector. 5.56 mM nitric acid mobile phase, 0.50 ml/min flow rate, 2.0 microliter injection volume. Data was analyzed using Water\u00ae Empower software (Waters Corporation, Milford, Mass.). The concentration of the antiperspirant in solution does not affect the retention time in the machine.</p>The design of modern AP salts aims at actives with high levels of low molecular weight Al and Zr species, which is reflected in a SEC trace that has intense Peak 4 and low Peaks 1, 2, and 3. Throughout the present study, the levels of the species corresponding to these peaks are estimated based on the following ratios (or percentages):</p>fPi=Pi\u2211\ue89ePj\ue89e\ue89ei=1,2,3,4,5;j=2,3,4,5</p>where f<sub>Pi </sub>is the fraction of peak i, and Pi or Pj are the intensity of peaks Pi or Pj, respectively. The amount of low molecular weight Al species will be correlated with the fraction, f<sub>P4</sub>, or percentage, f<sub>P4</sub>\u00d7100, of SEC-Peak 4. In brief, a preferred antiperspirant salt would have a very low f<sub>P1</sub>, f<sub>P2</sub>, f<sub>P3</sub>, and/or f<sub>P5</sub>, and a high f<sub>P4</sub>.</p>In certain embodiments, the ratio of Peak 4 "
