HEK-293 cells are transfected with pM-SiHi-Def-Lec. The SiHi-Def-Lec protein (55 kD) is identified in the supernatants of these cells by Westem-blot. To do this, the 55 kD protein is immunoprecipitated using \"Protein A-agarose\" beads (Sigma) sensitized by the polyclonal LeukC antibody prepared against the peptide ARGAEREWEGGWGGAQEE (Bannwarth, et al, 1998), present in the field SiHi. After elution, electrophoresis in a denaturing gel and Membott membrane transfer (Applied Biosystems), the 55kD protein is revealed using the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma). The supernatants are incubated with chronically producing CEM cells of HIV-1. A significant number of cells are lysed compared to parental CEM cells.</p>Supernatants of pM-SiHi-Def-Lec transfected HEK-293 cells are mixed at 50% (v / v) with infectious CEM cell supernatants chronically producing HIV-1. The reduction of infectious titres is tested on P4 cells, which are HeLa cells transduced to express the CD4 receptor and the lacZ gene under the control of a U3-R promoter of HIV-1 (Dragic et al, 1992). These cells make it possible to easily titrate the number of infectious particles as a function of the foci stained by the lacZ substrate. Thus, a reduction in infectious titer is observed after treatment with SiHi-Def-Lec, in comparison with untreated infectious supernatants and uninfected CEM cell supernatants.
