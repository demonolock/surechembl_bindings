    "tive embodiments, sequence variants of the AD and/or DDD moieties may be utilized in construction of the DNL complexes. The structure-function relationships of the AD and DDD domains have been the subject of investigation. (See, e.g., Burns-Hamuro et al., 2005, Protein Sci 14:2982-92; Can et al., 2001, J Biol Chem 276:17332-38; Alto et al., 2003, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 100:4445-50; Hundsrucker et al., 2006, Biochem J 396:297-306; Stokka et al., 2006, Biochem J 400:493-99; Gold et al., 2006, Mol Cell 24:383-95; Kinderman et al., 2006, Mol Cell 24:397-408.)</p>For example, Kinderman et al. (2006) examined the crystal structure of the AD-DDD binding interaction and concluded that the human DDD sequence contained a number of conserved amino acid residues that were important in either dimer formation or AKAP binding, underlined in SEQ ID NO:7 below. (See FIG. 1 of Kinderman et al., 2006, incorporated herein by reference.) The skilled artisan will realize that in designing sequence variants of the DDD sequence, one would desirably avoid changing any of the underlined residues, while conservative amino acid substitutions might be made for residues that are less critical for dimerization and AKAP binding.</p>Human DDD Sequence from Protein Kinase a</p>(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u20037)SHIQIPPGLTELLQGYTVEVLRQQPPDLVEFAVEYFTRLREARA</p>Alto et al. (2003) performed a bioinformatic analysis of the AD sequence of various AKAP proteins to design an RII selective AD sequence called AKAP-IS (SEQ ID NO:9), with a binding constant for DDD of 0.4 nM. The AKAP-IS sequence was designed as a peptide antagonist of AKAP binding to PKA. Residues in the AKAP-IS sequence where substitutions tended to decrease binding to DDD are underlined in SEQ ID NO:9.</p>AKAP-IS\u2003SEQUENCE(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u20039)QIEYLAKQIVDNAIQQA</p>Similarly, Gold (2006) utilized crystallography and peptide screening to develop a SuperAKAP-IS sequence (SEQ ID NO:11), exhibiting a five order of magnitude higher selectivity for the RII isoform of PKA compared with the RI isoform. Underlined residues indicate the positions of amino acid substitutions, relative to the AKAP-IS sequence, that increased binding to the DDD moiety of RII\u03b1. In this sequence, the N-terminal Q residue is numbered as residue number 4 and the C-terminal A residue is residue number 20. Residues where substitutions could be made to affect the affinity for RII\u03b1 were residues 8, 11, 15, 16, 18, 19 and 20 (Gold et al., 2006). It is contemplated that in certain alternative embodiments, the SuperAKAP-IS sequence may be substituted for the AKAP-IS AD moiety sequence to prepare DNL constructs. Other alternative sequences that might be substituted for the AKAP-IS AD sequence are shown in SEQ ID NO:12-14. Substitutions relative to the AKAP-IS sequence are underlined. It is anticipated that, as with the AKAP-IS sequence (SEQ ID NO:9), the AD moiety may also include additional N-terminal cysteine and glycine and C-terminal glycine and cysteine residues, as shown in SEQ ID NO:10.</p>SuperAKAP-IS(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u200311)QIEYVAKQIVDYAIHQA Alternative\u2003AKAP\u2003sequences(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u200312)QIEYKAKQIVDHAIHQA (SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u200313)QIEYHAKQIVDHAIHQA (SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u200314)QIEYVAKQIVDHAIHQA</p>Stokka et al. (2006) also developed peptide competitors of AKAP binding to PKA, shown in SEQ ID NO:15-17. The peptide antagonists were designated as Ht31 (SEQ ID NO:15), RIAD (SEQ ID NO:16) and PV-38 (SEQ ID NO:17). The Ht-31 peptide exhibited a greater affinity for the RII isoform of PKA, while the RIAD and PV-38 showed higher affinity for RI.</p>Ht31(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u200315)DLIEEAASRIVDAVIEQVKAAGAY RIAD(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u200316)LEQYANQLADQIIKEATE PV-38(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u200317)FEELAWKIAKMIWSDVFQQC</p>Hundsrucker et al. (2006) developed still other peptide competitors for AKAP binding to PKA, with a binding constant as low as 0.4 nM to the DDD of the RII form of PKA. The sequences of various AKAP antagonistic peptides is provided in Table 1 of Hundsrucker et al. (incorporated herein by reference). Residues that were highly conserved among the AD domains of different AKAP proteins are indicated below by underlining with reference to the AKAP IS sequence (SEQ ID NO:9). The residues are the same as observed by Alto et al. (2003), with the addition of the C-terminal alanine residue. (See FIG. 4 of Hundsrucker et al. (2006), incorporated herein by reference.) The sequences of peptide antagonists with particularly high affinities for the RII DDD sequence are shown in SEQ ID NO:18-20.</p>AKAP-IS(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u20039)QIEYLAKQIVDNAIQQA AKAP7\u03b4-wt-pep(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u200318)PEDAELVRLSKRLVENAVLKAVQQY AKAP7\u03b4-L304T-pep(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u200319)PEDAELVRTSKRLVENAVLKAVQQY AKAP7\u03b4-L308D-pep(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u200320)PEDAELVRLSKRDVENAVLKAVQQY</p>Carr et al. (2001) examined the degree of sequence homology between different AKAP-binding DDD sequences from human and non-human proteins and identified residues in the DDD sequences that appeared to be the most highly conserved among different DDD moieties. These are indicated below by underlining with reference to the human PKA RII\u03b1 DDD sequence of SEQ ID NO:7. Residues that were particularly conserved are further indicated by italics. The residues overlap with, but are not identical to those suggested by Kinderman et al. (2006) to be important for binding to AKAP proteins.</p>(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003"
