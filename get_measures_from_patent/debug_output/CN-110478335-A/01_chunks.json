    "agnolol and honokiol be it is selective, can\nApparent inhibitory effect is played for clostridium difficile.So magnolol and honokiol are for the inhibitory activity of clostridium difficile\nIt is non-obvious.</p>3 magnolol of embodiment and honokiol inhibit clostridium difficile gemma to sprout experiment</p>According to document The Journal of Infectious Diseases 2013\uff1bSide disclosed in 207:1498-504\nMethod culture purified obtains the gemma of ATCC BBA1870,43255 ATCC, 630 bacterial strain of ATCC.By the clostridium difficile spore of purifying\nIt precipitates and is washed with deionized three times, the buffer of storage spore is centrifuged off by 9400g.By spore, heat is living at 68 DEG C\nChange 30 minutes, then washs again three times to remove any spore sprouted automatically.With the 100mM phosphorus containing 5mg/mL sodium bicarbonate\nSour sodium buffer (pH6.0) adjusts spore liquid turbidity to OD580=1.0.Respectively by magnolol, honokiol and 6mM ox sulphur\n96 orifice plates are separately added into after cholate and the mixing of 12mM glycine.After adding spore, an OD580 is measured per minute and (is calculated as\nOD580 (t) continues 2 hours, and (is calculated as OD580 (t0) compared with the OD580 of zero point, calculates opposite OD580 [opposite OD580\n=OD580 (t)/OD580 (t0)].50 value of compound IC is calculated using software GraphpadPrism5.0:</p>As a result such as the following table 3 is recorded:</p>3 magnolol of table and honokiol inhibit spore germination IC50 (\u03bcM)</p>CompoundATCC BBA1870ATCC 43255ATCC 630Magnolol28.4835.1018.70Honokiol50.7167.5047.15</p>The result shows that the gemma that magnolol and honokiol generate the bacterial strain of different clostridium difficiles significantly inhibits\nIts effect sprouted.</p>To sum up, inhibit clostridium difficile thallus in preparation the present invention provides compound shown in formula A and/or inhibit clostridium difficile\nThe purposes in drug that gemma is sprouted, it is demonstrated experimentally that compound described in formula A, especially magnolol and honokiol, it can be significant\nInhibit the activity of clostridium difficile, and the sprouting of clostridium difficile gemma can be significantly inhibited, in preparation prevention and/or treats difficult shuttle\nHave in the drug of bacterium infectious diseases, clostridium difficile infection disease palindromia or clostridium difficile infection disease complications\nExtraordinary application prospect.</p>"
