    "ed a negative pair of D-isomersIC against tetrapeptide (Z-DNC) (A, B, C), Z-DTP1(A), Z-DTP2(B) or mDTP3(C)<sub>50</sub>. ARH-77 cells were treated with Z-DNC, Z-DTP1, Z-DTP2 or mDTP3 for 3 days. It can be seen that ARH-77 cells expressing sh-NS are highly sensitive to Z-/mDTP-induced killing (IC)<sub>50</sub>The value: mu.M (Z-DTP 1; A), 302nM (Z-DTP 2; B) and 303nM (mDTP 3; C)) was similar to that observed for uninfected parental ARH-77 cells (see Table IV). (A, B, C) in contrast, ARH-77 cells expressing sh-MKK7 were completely resistant to Z-/mDTP-induced killing (IC)<sub>50</sub>Value of&gt;10 \u03bcm) similar to that observed for Z-DNC treated ARH-77 cells. IC was calculated as described in the examples using increasing concentrations of Z-DNC (A, B, C), Z-DTP1(A), Z-DTP2(B) and mDTP3(C) from 0.01 to 10 \u03bcm<sub>50</sub>Similar data was obtained with additional Z-/mDTP sensitive multiple myeloma cell lines including U266, KMS-11 and KMS-12 cell lines (data not shown) (A, B, C) indicating that Z-/mDTP has very high targeting specificity for the Gadd45 \u03b2/MKK7 complex in multiple myeloma cells (see also fig. 12, relationship between Gadd45 \u03b2 expression and sensitivity to Z-DTP induced killed cancer cells).</p>FIG. 21 (A, B, C, D) the compounds of the invention do not bind Gadd45 \u03b2 or MKK7 alone as determined in the biomolecular interaction analysis (biacore assay) but bind to form a Gadd45 \u03b2/MKK7 complex (A) showing Gadd45 \u03b2 and MKK7 kinase domain immobilized on a chip (MKK 7)<sub>KD</sub>) Different concentrations of Gadd45 \u03b2 (20 to 200 nM) were injected into the previously fixed MKK7<sub>KD</sub>Record Gadd45 \u03b2 and MKK7<sub>KD</sub>Dose-dependent binding of and Gadd45 \u03b2/MKK7<sub>KD</sub>Dissociation curves for the complexes and determination of the equilibrium dissociation constant (K) by averaging the values of the kinetic parameters for each individual curve<sub>D</sub>) The value was 4.0. + -. 0.7 nM. Briefly, the signals are based on an increase or decrease of the corresponding SPR signal, denoted as Response Unit (RU), respectivelyBonding stage (k)<sub>a</sub>) And dissociation phase (k)<sub>d</sub>) Thermodynamic parameters (termodinamic parameters) to calculate equilibrium dissociation constants (B) MKK7 when Gadd45 \u03b2 was mounted on the chip<sub>KD</sub>Bound to Gadd45 \u03b2, here by injecting different concentrations of MKK7 onto the chip immobilized with Gadd45 \u03b2<sub>KD</sub>(1 to 25 nM) determination of K<sub>D</sub>The value is obtained. As in (A), at MKK7<sub>KD</sub>Dose response curves were recorded at all tested concentrations. Obtaining K from the above analysis<sub>D</sub>A value of 3.4. + -. 0.6nM very similar to the K obtained in (A)<sub>D</sub>The values (C) show the addition of Gadd45 \u03b2 or MKK7<sub>KD</sub>To determine whether mDTP3 binds Gadd45 \u03b2 and/or MKK7<sub>KD</sub>Injection of a solution containing mDTP3 at a concentration ranging from 1nM to 10. mu.M into a chip derivatized with one protein or the other it can be seen that even when the highest concentration of mDTP3 (i.e., 10. mu.M) was used, no binding of mDTP3 to Gadd45 \u03b2 or MKK7 was recorded (D) shows binding of mDTP3 to a preformed Gadd45 \u03b2/MKK7 complex, one uses MKK7<sub>KD</sub>The derivatized chips were loaded with 100nM Gadd45 \u03b2 (60. mu.L; contact time 3 min.) dissociation of the Gadd45 \u03b2 protein for about 10 min while approximately 50% of the Gadd45 \u03b2 remained bound to MKK7<sub>KD</sub>In the above, mDTP3 was injected at a concentration of 10nM, 100nM or 1. mu.M, respectively, it can be seen that mDTP3 induces Gadd45 \u03b2/MKK7 when the concentration of mDTP3 is 100nM or lower<sub>KD</sub>Rapid dissociation of the complexes it can also be seen that when mDTP3 was washed away, Gadd45 \u03b2/MKK7<sub>KD</sub>However at higher concentrations of mDTP3 (i.e., 1 \u03bc M), mDTP3 exhibited dose-response binding and dissociation curves, indicating that mDTP3 bound to Gadd45 \u03b2 and/or MKK7<sub>KD</sub>These data support the notion that DTP does not bind to either the independent Gadd45 \u03b2 or MKK7 proteins, and only when the two proteins are in contact with each other, DTP binds to one protein and/or the other protein, or to a complex of the two proteins.</p>Nomenclature used herein</p>In the various parts of this specification, compounds are represented by the expression LTP, DTP, LNC, DTP1, etc. The symbol containing \"NC\" indicates a negative control not within the scope of the present invention.

The same process is performed on the other channel: EDC/NHS activation and inactivation with ethanolamine were used. This channel was used as a reference and its signal as a blank control and correspondingly from detecting Gadd45 or MKK7<sub>KD</sub>To determine whether these two proteins were effectively immobilized, we repeated injections of Gadd45 \u03b2 (20-200 nM) and MKK7 at increasing protein concentrations<sub>KD</sub>(1-25 nM) (contact time 3 min; 60. mu.L). 1M NaCl can be injected (1 min, MKK 7)<sub>KD</sub>Derivatization channel) or 20mM NaOH (30 sec, Gadd45 \u03b2 derivatization channel).</p>Finally, the tripeptide mDTP3 (Ac-D-Tyr-D-Arg-D-Phe-NH) was injected onto the chip in an increasing concentration range<sub>2</sub>) In another independent experiment, Gadd45 \u03b2 was tested from immobilized MKK7<sub>KD</sub>Or MKK7<sub>KD</sub>The phase of dissociation from immobilized Gadd45 \u03b2 was injected with mdtp3 the results of these analyses are shown in fig. 21A, 21B, 21C and 21D.</p>Results</p>As can be seen in FIG. 21A, Gadd45 \u03b2 binds to immobilized MKK7<sub>KD</sub>The Gadd45 \u03b2/MKK7 was determined by averaging the values calculated from each different curve<sub>KD</sub>Dissociation constant (K) of<sub>D</sub>) And was determined to be 4.0. + -. 0.7nM (see FIG. 21A.) similarly, MKK7 was repeatedly injected into the Gadd45 \u03b2 channel<sub>KD</sub>Providing a dose-response binding and dissociation curve (FIG. 21B), and determining K from the curve<sub>D</sub>3.4. + -. 0.6 nM.</p>To determine if mDTP3 and MKK7<sub>KD</sub>And/or Gadd45 \u03b2 to Gadd45 \u03b2 and MKK7<sub>KD</sub>Derivatization channel injection of peptide sample (i.e., mDTP 3) unexpectedly, as can be seen in fig. 21C, the data indicate that this does not bind independent Gadd45 \u03b2 or MKK7<sub>KD</sub>However, it is clear when starting from MKK7 at Gadd45 \u03b2<sub>KD</sub>(FIG. 21D) or MKK7<sub>KD</sub>When mDTP3 was injected from a stage of dissociation above Gadd45 \u03b2 (data not shown), its binding was observed and dose-response binding and dissociation curves could be recorded.</p>FIG. 21D shows that the peptide induces Gadd45 \u03b2/MKK7 when mDTP3 is injected at low concentrations of 10nM or 100nM<sub>KD</sub>It can be seen that, when the peptide was washed away, Gadd45 \u03b2/MKK7<sub>KD</sub>FIG. 21D also shows that at higher concentrations (i.e., 1 \u03bc M) of mDTP3 injection, dose-response binding and dissociation curves were recorded, indicating that mDTP3 binds to Gadd45 \u03b2 and/or MKK7<sub>KD</sub>Taken together, these data indicate that mDTP3 does not bind to the independent Gadd45 \u03b2 or MKK7 proteins (even when used at high concentrations), but instead mDTP3 binds to Gadd45 \u03b2, MKK7<sub>KD</sub>Or the surface binding resulting from the interaction of these two proteins requires the formation of a Gadd45 \u03b2/MKK7 complex these data are important because it suggests that our target of therapeutic action is the interface between the two proteins (i.e. Gadd45 \u03b2 and MKK 7), which offers the potential for high target selectivity in cells, a key advantage of the present invention over existing therapies.</p>Example 15: in vivo pharmacokinetic (DMPK) profiles of Z-DTP2 and mDTP3</p>To evaluate the applicability of Z-DTP2 and mDTP3 for therapeutic use in vivo, we performed pharmacokinetic analyses in mice.</p>Materials and methods</p>Study of mouse pharmacokinetics:</p>summary of test procedure:</p>Z-DTP2 and Z-mDTP3 were administered intravenously to mice.
