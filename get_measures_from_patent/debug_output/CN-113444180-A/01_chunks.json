In certain embodiments, at least one (or all) substitution in a CDR sequence is a conservative substitution.</p>In certain embodiments, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment comprises one or more CDR sequences having sequence identity of at least 80% (e.g., at least 85%, 88%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%) to the sequence of SEQ ID NOs 9-32, while retaining similar or even higher binding affinity to the AXL protein as its parent antibody. The parent antibodies have substantially identical sequences, but the corresponding CDR sequences have 100% sequence identity to the sequences set forth in SEQ ID Nos. 9-32.</p>In some embodiments, the antibodies or antigen binding fragments described herein can have a size of \u2266 10<sup>-7</sup>Binding affinity of M (K)<sub>D</sub>) Specific binding to the AXL protein, as measured by surface plasmon resonance. The binding affinity value may be K<sub>D</sub>The value is expressed as the ratio of the off-rate to the on-rate (k) at which the binding of antigen and antigen binding molecule reaches equilibrium<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>) And (4) calculating. The antigen bindingAffinity (e.g. K)<sub>D</sub>) May be suitably determined by suitable methods known in the art, including, for example, plasmon resonance binding using an instrument such as Biacore.</p>In certain embodiments, the antibodies or antigen binding fragments described herein bind to EC50 (i.e., half the binding concentration) of the AXL protein at between 1ng/mL and 10 \u03bc g/mL. Binding of the antibody or antigen binding fragment to the AXL protein can be determined by methods known in the art such as sandwich methods such as ELISA, Western blot, FACS or other binding assays. In an illustrative example, the antibody to be tested (i.e., the primary antibody) is bound to immobilized AXL protein or cells expressing AXL protein, followed by washing away unbound antibody, and introducing a labeled secondary antibody that is capable of binding to the primary antibody and thus detecting the bound secondary antibody. The detection may be performed on a microplate reader plate when immobilized AXL protein is used, or may be performed using FACS analysis when cells expressing AXL protein are used.</p>In certain embodiments, the antibodies or antigen binding fragments described herein bind to the AXL protein with an EC50 (i.e., an effective concentration of 50%) of 10ng/mL to 10 \u03bc g/mL (as determined using FACS analysis).</p>In some embodiments, the antibodies described herein are advantageous in that they can be used in combination with immunogenic agents, such as tumor cells, purified tumor antigens and cells transfected with an encoding immunostimulatory factor, tumor vaccines. Furthermore, the antibodies and antigen binding fragments thereof targeting the AXL protein may be included in combination therapies, including standard chemotherapy and radiotherapy, target-based small molecule therapy, other emerging immune checkpoint modulator therapies. In some embodiments, the antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof can be used as the base molecule for antibody-drug conjugates, bispecific or multivalent antibodies.</p>In some embodiments, the antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof described herein are camelized single domain antibodies (camelized single domain antibodies), diabodies (diabodies), scfvs, scFv dimers, BsFv, dsFv, (dsFv)2, dsFv-dsFv ', Fv fragments, Fab ', F (ab ')2, ds diabodies (ds diabodies), nanobodies, domain antibodies, or diabodies.</p>In some embodiments, the antibodies described herein comprise an immunoglobulin constant region. In some embodiments, the immunoglobulin constant region comprises a heavy chain and/or light chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region includes the CH1, CH1-CH2, or CH1-CH3 regions.
