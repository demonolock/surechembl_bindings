    " Devices) which was previously resuspended with 200 mL of assay buffer [HBSS w/ Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> w/o phenol red, 20 mM HEPES, 0.1% BSA, 10 mL probenecid (710 mg probenecid in 5 mL of 1 N NaOH, to which was then added 5 mL HBSS containing 20 mM HEPES)] was added to each well of the 96-well plate. The plate was incubated at 37 C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 30 min in dark. The plate was removed and allowed to reach RT for 15 min in the dark. The assay was then run on the FLIPR. In Brief: base line read for 1 min, compound added (25 \u00b5L) and incubated for 4 min, 15 seconds, PK1 ligand preparation added (25 \u00b5L) for a final concentration of a previously determined EC<sub>50</sub> and fluorescence was counted for 1 min, 45 seconds. Baseline is described as the amount of relative fluorescence read when buffer alone is added to cells. Baseline was subtracted from all wells. Percent of control was calculated as follows:\n(Baseline subtracted well value is divided by baseline subtracted max value)*100. Percent inhibition is 100 minus the percent of control value.</p>The IC<sub>50</sub> is defined as the amount of a given compound required to inhibit 50% of the maximum signal that is generated by the concentration of PK1 preparation used in our assay. IC<sub>50</sub> values were calculated using GraphPad Prism.</p>Table 2 includes data generated from the PK1 functional assay described in Example 2.</p>Biological and Mass Spectral DataTable 2CpdCa<sup>2+</sup> Mobilization IC50 (\u00b5M)Ca<sup>2+</sup> Mobilization %Inh @ 10 \u00b5MMS obsMS calc1&gt;1030411.9412.1920.125, 0.363, 0.336, 0.927*92, 85, 74, 87*424.3424.2134.9652452.0452.2042.571438.0438.2352.1867390.1390.2362.5959414.0414.197&gt;1052462.0462.1983.8564450.1450.269&gt;1035438.9439.1810&gt;1033440.2440.2011&gt;1032395.2395.19120.034, 0.082, 0.247*97, 96, 94, 90*438.3438.23130.104, 0.25692, 91460.2460.1914&gt;1041465.9466.26156.1155461.9462.19160.83677442.0442.20170.014, 0.033, 0.087*100, 99, 97442.0442.20180.007, 0.028, 0.041, 0.022, 0.054*98, 100,101, 99492.0492.13190.86281477.8478.18203.6961454.0454.2221&gt;1043454.0454.22220.94780436.9437.21231.2574450.9451.22240.04199456.0456.22250.13794437.9438.23260.35488437.9438.23271.9755508.2508.13280.71101517.1517.13290.042, 0.047101, 102505.8506.15300.009, 0.019101, 103457.8458.17310.009, 0.021101,102453.9454.22320.601, 0.78188, 86519.7520.16332.8666455.9456.22340.51589519.7520.16350.061, 0.097, 0.113*100, 101, 101*519.7520.16361.3277545.8546.18370.038, 0.201, 0.326*98, 100, 98, 99*507.7508.11380.055, 0.178, 0.194*98, 94, 98*489.7490.15390.90981457.8458.17400.24898545.7546.10410.027, 0.047, 0.064*101, 100, 99*527.7528.11420.28192545.8546.1843&gt;1031547.8546.18440.011, 0.046100, 98506.1506.15450.018103469.8470.20460.058101452.0452.24470.057101547.7546.18480.79894532.1532.1349275518.1518.15500.24896518.7519.14510.047100504.8505.13526.5258505.8506.15530.014, 0.02599, 101520.1520.16540.014, 0.00698, 101534.1534.18556.7358517.7518.15560.06198511.8512.225"
