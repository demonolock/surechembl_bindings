    "ceptable salts. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are those salts which substantially retain the biologic activity of the free bases and which are prepared by reaction with inorganic acids. Pharmaceutical salts tend to be more soluble in aqueous and other protic solvents than are the corresponding free base forms.</p>The compounds of the invention will generally be used in an amount effective to achieve the intended purpose (e.g., treatment of central or peripheral neuronal injury). The therapies of the invention are performed by administering the subject drug in a therapeutically effective amount. By therapeutically effective amount is meant an amount effective ameliorate or prevent the symptoms, or prolong the survival of, the patient being treated. Determination of a therapeutically effective amount is well within the capabilities of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the detailed disclosure provided herein. An \u201ctherapeutic amount\u201d or \u201ctherapeutic concentration\u201d of a NMDAR isoforms or antibodies is an amount that reduces binding activity to receptor by at least about 40%, preferably at least about 50%, often at least about 70%, and even as much as at least about 90%. Binding can be measured in vitro (e.g., in an assay) or in situ.</p>For systemic administration, a therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from in vitro assays. For example, a dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating concentration range that includes the IC50. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans.</p>Initial dosages can also be estimated from in vivo data, e.g., animal models, using techniques that are well known in the art. One having ordinary skill in the art could readily optimize administration to humans based on animal data.</p>Dosage amount and interval may be adjusted individually to provide plasma levels of the compounds that are sufficient to maintain therapeutic effect. Usual patient dosages for administration by injection range from about 0.1 to 10 mg/day, preferably from about 0.5 to 1 mg/day. Therapeutically effective serum levels may be achieved by administering multiple doses each day. For usual peptide/antibodies therapeutic treatment of cerebral ischemic events within 6 hours of event is typical.</p>In cases of local, administration or selective uptake, the effective local concentration of the compounds may not be related to plasma concentration and should be optimized therapeutically effective local dosages without undue experimentation. The amount of compound administered will, of course, be dependent on the subject being treated, on the subject's weight, the severity of the affliction, the manner of administration and the judgment of the prescribing physician.</p>The therapy may be repeated intermittently while symptoms detectable or even when they are not detectable. The therapy may be provided alone or in combination with other drugs. Preferably, a therapeutica"
