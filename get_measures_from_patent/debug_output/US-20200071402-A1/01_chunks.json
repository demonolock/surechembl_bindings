    "b since immune complexes containing F(ab\u2032)<sub>2 </sub>antibody fragments are not inhibitory (Chan, P. L. &amp; Sinclair, N. R., 1973, Immunology 24, 289-301). The intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) of Fc\u03b3RIIb is necessary to inhibit BCR-induced intracellular signals (Amigorena, S. et al., 1992, Science 256, 1808-1812; Muta, T., et al., 1994, Nature 368, 70-73). This inhibitory effect occurs through phosphorylation of the Fc\u03b3RIIb ITIM, which recruits SH2-containing inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (SHIP) to neutralize ITAM-induced intracellular calcium mobilization (Kiener, P. A., et al., 1997, J. Biol. Chem. 272, 3838-3844; Ono, M., et al., 1996, Nature 383, 263-266; Ravetch, J. V. &amp; Lanier, L. L., 2000, Science 290, 84-89). In addition, Fc\u03b3RIIb-mediated SHIP phosphorylation inhibits the downstream Ras-MAPK proliferation pathway (Tridandapani, S. et al., 1998, Immunol. 35, 1135-1146).</p>SUMMARY OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTSThe present disclosure provides novel immunoglobulins, compositions comprising such immunoglobulins, and methods of using the immunoglobulin to inhibit cells that express Fc\u03b3RIIb.

An Fc variant comprises one or more amino acid modifications relative to a parent Fc polypeptide, wherein the amino acid modification(s) provide one or more optimized properties. An Fc variant disclosed herein differs in amino acid sequence from its parent by virtue of at least one amino acid modification. Thus Fc variants disclosed herein have at least one amino acid modification compared to the parent. Alternatively, the Fc variants disclosed herein may have more than one amino acid modification as compared to the parent, for example from about one to fifty amino acid modifications, e.g., from about one to ten amino acid modifications, from about one to about five amino acid modifications, etc. compared to the parent. Thus the sequences of the Fc variants and those of the parent Fc polypeptide are substantially homologous. For example, the variant Fc variant sequences herein will ",

For example, the Fc variant with improved Fc receptor binding affinity may display from about 5 fold to about 1000 fold, e.g. from about 10 fold to about 500 fold improvement in Fc receptor binding affinity compared to the parent Fc polypeptide, where Fc receptor binding affinity is determined, for example, by the binding methods disclosed herein, including but not limited to Biacore, by one skilled in the art. Accordingly, by \u201creduced affinity\u201d as compared to a parent Fc polypeptide as used herein is meant that an Fc variant binds an Fc receptor with significantly lower K<sub>A </sub>or higher K<sub>D </sub>than the parent Fc polypeptide. Greater or reduced affinity can also be defined relative to an absolute level of affinity. For example, according to the data herein, WT (native) IgG1 binds Fc\u03b3RIIb with an affinity of about 1.5 \u03bcM, or about 1500 nM. Furthermore, some Fc variants described herein bind Fc\u03b3RIIb with an affinity about 10-fold greater to WT IgG1. As disclosed herein, greater or enhanced affinity means having a K<sub>D </sub>lower than about 100 nM, for example between about 10 nM-about 100 nM, between about 1-about 100 nM, or less than about 1 nM.</p>In one embodiment, the Fc variants provide selectively enhanced affinity to Fc\u03b3RIIb relative to one or more activating receptors. Selectively enhanced affinity means either that the Fc variant has improved affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIb relative to the activating receptor(s) as compare",

In some embodiments, target antigens include those that are not expressed by CD32b+ cells, but may be bound to CD32b+ cells, e.g., via the BCR. For example, in certain embodiments, the immunoglobulins may target an autoimmune antigen or allergen.

Accordingly, disclosed herein are methods of inhibiting CD32b+ cells comprising contacting a CD32b+ cell with an immunoglobulin comprising an Fc region with enhanced affinity to Fc\u03b3RIIb. In one embodiment, the immunoglobulin binds at least two B cell proteins, e.g., at least to proteins bound to the surface B cells. In one embodiment, the first of said B cell proteins is Fc\u03b3RIIb. In a another embodiment, the second of said B cell proteins is part of the B cell receptor (BCR) complex, which may include an antigen bound to BCR.

In another embodiment, said the second of said B cell proteins is expressed on the surface of the B cell, but is not",
    " in the art, any of a wide variety of sequences may be used as linkers. For example, a common linker sequence comprises the amino acid sequence GGGGS. A fusion partner may be a targeting or signal sequence that directs immunoglobulin and any associated fusion partners to a desired cellular location or to the extracellular media. As is known in the art, certain signaling sequences may target a protein to be either secreted into the growth media, or into the periplasmic space, located between the inner and outer membrane of the cell. A fusion partner may also be a sequence that encodes a peptide or protein that enables purification and/or screening. Such fusion partners include but are not limited to polyhistidine tags (His-tags) (for example H<sub>6 </sub>and H<sub>10 </sub>or other tags for use with Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) systems (e.g. Ni<sup>+2</sup>affinity columns)), GST fusions, MBP fusions, Strep-tag, the BSP biotinylation target sequence of the bacterial enzyme BirA, and epitope tags which are targeted by antibodies (for example c-myc tags, flag-tags, and the like). As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, such tags may be useful for purification, for screening, or both. For example, an immunoglobulin may be purified using a His-tag by immobilizing it to a Ni<sup>+2 </sup>affinity column, and then after purification the same His-tag may be used to immobilize the antibody to a Ni<sup>+2 </sup>coated plate to perform an ELISA or other binding assay (as described below). A fusion partner may enable the use of a selection method to screen immunoglobulins (see below). Fusion partners that enable a variety of selection methods are well-known in the art. For example, by fusing the members of an immunoglobulin library to the gene III protein, phage display can be employed (Kay et al., Phage display of peptides and proteins: a laboratory manual, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., 1996; Lowman et al., 1991, Biochemistry 30:10832-10838; Smith, 1985, Science 228:1315-1317, incorporated entirely by reference). Fusion partners may enable immunoglobulins to be labeled. Alternatively, a fusion partner may bind to a specific sequence on the expression vector, enabling the fusion partner and associated immunoglobulin to be linked covalently or noncovalently with the nucleic acid that encodes them. The methods of introducing exogenous nucleic acid into host cells are well known in the art, and will vary with the host cell used. Techniques include but are not limited to dextran-mediated transfection, calcium phosphate precipitation, calcium chloride treatment, polybrene mediated transfection, protoplast fusion, electroporation, viral or phage infection, encapsulation of the polynucleotide(s) in liposomes, and direct microinjection of the DNA into nuclei. In the case of mammalian cells, transfection may be either transient or stable.</p>In one embodiment, immunoglobulins are purified or isolated after expression. Proteins ma",
    "ased assays, and selection technologies. Automation and high-throughput screening technologies may be utilized in the screening procedures. Screening may employ the use of a fusion partner or label. The use of fusion partners has been discussed above. By \u201clabeled\u201d herein is meant that the immunoglobulins disclosed herein have one or more elements, isotopes, or chemical compounds attached to enable the detection in a screen. In general, labels fall into three classes: a) immune labels, which may be an epitope incorporated as a fusion partner that is recognized by an antibody, b) isotopic labels, which may be radioactive or heavy isotopes, and c) small molecule labels, which may include fluorescent and colorimetric dyes, or molecules such as biotin that enable other labeling methods. Labels may be incorporated into the compound at any position and may be incorporated in vitro or in vivo during protein expression.</p>In one embodiment, the functional and/or biophysical properties of immunoglobulins are screened in an in vitro assay. In vitro assays may allow a broad dynamic range for screening properties of interest. Properties of immunoglobulins that may be screened include but are not limited to stability, solubility, and affinity for Fc ligands, for example Fc\u03b3Rs. Multiple properties may be screened simultaneously or individually. Proteins may be purified or unpurified, depending on the requirements of the assay. In one embodiment, the screen is a qualitative or quantitative binding assay for binding of immunoglobulins to a protein or nonprotein molecule that is known or thought to bind the immunoglobulin. In one embodiment, the screen is a binding assay for measuring binding to the target antigen. In an alternate embodiment, the screen is an assay for binding of immunoglobulins to an Fc ligand, including but are not limited to the family of Fc\u03b3Rs, the neonatal receptor FcRn, the complement protein C1q, and the bacterial proteins A and G. Said Fc ligands may be from any organism. In one embodiment, Fc ligands are from humans, mice, rats, rabbits, and/or monkeys. Binding assays can be carried out using a variety of methods known in the art, including but not limited to FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) and BRET (Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer)-based assays, AlphaScreen\u2122 (Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay), Scintillation Proximity Assay, ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay), SPR (Surface Plasmon Resonance, also known as BIACORE\u00ae), isothermal titration calorimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, gel electrophoresis, and chromatography including gel filtration. These and other methods may take advantage of some fusion partner or label of the immunoglobulin. Assays may employ a variety of detection methods including but not limited to chromogenic, fluorescent, luminescent, or isotopic labels.</p>The biophysical properties of immunoglobulins, for example stability and solubility, may be screened using a variety of methods known in the art. Protein stability may be determined by measuring the thermodynamic equilibrium between folded and unfolded states. For example, immunoglobulins disclosed herein may be unfolded using chemical denaturant, heat, or pH, and this transition may be monitored using methods including but not limited to circular dichroism spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, absorbance spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, calorimetry, and proteolysis. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the kinetic parameters of the folding and unfolding transitions may also be monitored using these and other techniques. The solubility and overall structural integrity of an immunoglobulin may be quantitatively or qualitatively determined using a wide range of methods that are known in the art. Methods which may find use for characterizing the biophysical properties of immunoglobulins disclosed herein include gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, capillary electrophoresis, chromatography such as size exclusion chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, peptide mapping, oligosaccharide mapping, mass spectrometry, ultraviolet absorbance spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, analytical ultra-centrifugation, dynamic light scattering, proteolysis, and cross-linking, turbidity measurement, filter retardation assays, immunological assays, fluorescent dye binding assays, protein-staining assays, microscopy, and detection of aggregates via ELISA or other binding assay. Structural analysis employing X-ray crystallographic techniques and NMR spectroscopy may also find use. In one embodiment, stability and/or solubility may be measured by determining the amount of protein solution after some defined period of time. In this assay, the protein may or may not be exposed to some extreme condition, for example elevated temperature, low pH, or the presence of denaturant. Because function typically requires a stable, soluble, and/or well-folded/structured protein, the aforementioned functional and binding assays also provide ways to perform such a measurement. For example, a solution comprising an immunoglobulin could be assayed for its ability to bind target antigen, then exposed to elevated temperature for one or more defined periods of time, then assayed for antigen binding again. Because unfolded and aggregated protein is not expected to be capable of binding antigen, the amount of activity remaining provides a measure of the immunoglobulin's stability and solubility.</p>In one embodiment, the library is screened using one or more cell-based or in vitro assays. For such assays, immunoglobulins, purified or unpurified, are typically added exogenously such that cells are exposed to individual variants or groups of variants belonging to a library. These assays are typically, but not always, based on the biology of the ability of the immunoglobulin to bind to the target antigen and mediate some biochemical event, for example effector f",

TIMPs), 2-methodyestradiol, MMI 270 (CGS 27023A), plasminogen activiator inhibitor (PAI), platelet factor-4 (PF4), prinomastat, prolactin 16 kDa fragment, proliferin-related protein (PRP), PTK 787/ZK 222594, retinoids, solimastat, squalamine, SS3304, SU5416, SU6668, SU11248, tetrahydrocortisol-S, tetrathiomolybdate, thalidomide, thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), TNP-470, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2), vasculostatin, vasostatin (calreticulin fragment), ZS6126, and ZD6474.</p>In one embodiment, the immunoglobulin is administered with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. By \u201ctyrosine kinase inhibitor\u201d as used herein is meant a molecule that inhibits to some extent tyrosine kinase activity of a tyrosine kinase. Examples of such inhibitors include but are not limited to quinazolines, such as PD 153035, 4-(3-chloroanilino) quinazoline; pyridopyrimidines; pyrimidopyrimidines; pyrrolopyrimidines, such as CGP 59326, CGP 60261 and CGP 62706; pyrazolopyrimidines, 4-(phenylamino)-7H-pyrrolo(2,3-d) pyrimidines; curcumin (diferuloyl methane, 4,5-bis (4-fluoroanilino)phthalimide); tyrphostines containing nitrothiophene moieties; PD-0183805 (Warner-Lambert); antisense molecules (e.g. those that bind to ErbB-encoding nucleic acid); quinoxalines (U.S. Pat.

    "g nickel affinity chromatography.</p>Variants were screened for receptor affinity using Biacore\u2122 technology, also referred to as Biacore herein, a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) based technology for studying biomolecular interactions in real time. SPR measurements were performed using a Biacore 3000 instrument (Biacore, Piscataway, N.J.). A protein A/G (Pierce Biotechnology) CM5 biosensor chip (Biacore) was generated using a standard primary amine coupling protocol. All measurements were performed using HBS-EP buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% vol/vol surfactant P20, Biacore). Antibodies at 20 nM or 50 nM in HBS-EP buffer were immobilized on the protein A/G surface and Fc\u03b3Rs were injected. After each cycle, the surface was regenerated by injecting glycine buffer (10 mM, pH 1.5). Data were processed by zeroing time and response before the injection of Fc\u03b3R and by subtracting appropriate nonspecific signals (response of reference channel and injection of running buffer). Kinetic analyses were performed by global fitting of binding data with a 1:1 Langmuir binding model using BIAevaluation software (Biacore).</p>A representative set of sensorgrams for binding of select variant anti-CD19 antibodies to Fc\u03b3RIIb is shown in FIG. 6. The affinities (equilibrium Kds) of all variants and WT (native) IgG1 to all of the Fc\u03b3Rs, obtained from fits of the Biacore binding data, are presented in FIG. 7A-FIG. 7D. Whereas WT IgG1 Fc binds with Fc\u03b3RIIb with \u03bcM affinity (Kd=1467 nM in FIG. 7), a large number of variants have been engineered that bind more tightly. Because all of the antibodies tested have specificity for CD19 (via their Fv region), the binding results in FIG. 7A-FIG. 7D are due solely to binding to Fc\u03b3RIIb by the Fc region. This is supported by the lack of detectable binding by the Fc-KO variants (G236R/L328R and {circumflex over (\u2003)}236R/L328R), which are ablated for binding to all Fc\u03b3Rs.</p>A useful quantity for analysis of the variants is their fold affinity relative to WT IgG1, which is generated by dividing the Kd for binding of WT IgG1 by the Kd for binding of variant for each receptor. These fold affinity results are provided in FIG. 8A-FIG. 8D. A number of variants have Fc\u03b3RIIb binding enhancements over 2 logs, and substantially reduced or ablated affinities for the activating receptors. In particular, S267E (single substitution) as well as L235Y/S267E, G236D/S267E, S239D/S267E, S267E/H268E, and S267E/L328F (double substitutions) have markedly higher affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIb. In addition, these variant have affinity for the activating receptor Fc\u03b3RIIIa that is either comparable to native IgG1, modestly enhanced, or even significantly reduced.</p>FIG. 9 shows a plot of the Fc\u03b3R affinities of select variants on a log scale, compared with those of WT IgG1. The variant with the highest affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIb, S267E/L328F, shows over 2 orders of magnitude improvement in affinity to Fc\u03b3RIIb, and significantly reduced affinity to the activating receptors, including Fc\u03b3RIIIa, Fc\u03b3RI, and H131 Fc\u03b3RIIa.</p>The data in FIGS. 9 and 10 indicate that the properties of the variants are highly dependent not only on the position that is mutated, but also the precise amino acid that is substituted at each position. For example, one of the strongest positions for controlling Fc\u03b3RIIb affinity and selectivity relative to activating Fc\u03b3Rs is position 267. Yet modification at this position can yield dramatically different results depending on the particular amino acid that is substituted In particular, as shown in FIG. 10, whereas affinity o",
    "g pairs of positions resulted in a greater than expected affinity for one or more Fc\u03b3Rs: 234/267, 235/267, 236/267, 236/268, 239/267, 239/268, 266/267, 267/328, and 268/327.</p>In order to validate the Biacore data and evaluate receptor binding of the variants on the cell surface, binding of select antibodies to cells expressing Fc\u03b3RIIb was measured. Since HEK293T cells do not express CD19 or Fc\u03b3Rs, transfection of these cells with Fc\u03b3RIIb allowed an analysis of antibody binding to Fc receptors in an isolated system on a cell surface. HEK293T cells in DMEM with 10% FBS were transfected with human Fc\u03b3RIIb cDNA in pCMV6 expression vector (Origene Technologies, Rockville, Md.), cultured for 3 days, harvested, washed twice in PBS, resuspended in PBS with 0.1% BSA (PBS/BSA), and aliquoted at 2\u00d7105 cells per well into 96-well microtiter plates. Fc variant antibodies were serially diluted in PBS/BSA then added to the cells and incubated with mixing for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing with PBS/BSA, phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled anti-human-Fab-specific goat F(ab\u2032)2 fragment was added for detection. Cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, washed, and resuspended in PBS/BSA. Binding was evaluated using a FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.), and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was plotted as a function of antibody concentration using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, Calif.) from which half-maximal binding (EC50) values were determined by sigmoidal dose response modeling.</p>Receptor expression levels were assessed prior to binding of antibodies, and half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) values of the MFI at different antibody concentrations were determined. FIG. 12 shows the results of this experiment. The EC50 values of the variants tested showed a similar rank order as the Biacore results. The cell-surface binding confirmed that the S267E/L328F variant of those tested has the highest affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIb, with an EC50 approximately 320-fold relative to WT IgG1. The strong agreement between these cell surface binding data and the Biacore binding data support the accuracy of the affinity measurements.</p>Because of the importance of animal models in drug development, select variants were screened further for binding to mouse and cynomolgous monkey receptors. The extracellular regions of mouse and cynologous monkey (Macaca fascicularis) Fc\u03b3Rs were expressed and purified. The extracellular regions of these receptors were obtained by PCR from clones obtained from the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC), or generated de novo using recursive PCR. To enable purification and screening, receptors were fused C-terminally with a His- and GST-tag. Tagged Fc\u03b3Rs were transfected into 293T cells, and media containing secreted receptor were harvested 3 days later and purified using Nickel chromatography.</p>Variant antibodies were tested for their affinity to mouse or cynologous monkey Fc\u03b3Rs using Biacore SPR as described above. Specifically, antibodies were first immobilized on a protein A/G chip to high density, and then followed by injections of the extracellular domain of the mouse or cynologous monkey Fc\u03b3R of interest. Both association and dissociation phases were tracked in real time using the Biacore technology. FIG. 13A-FIG. 13D show the fold improvements (compared to WT IgG1) for binding of select variants to mouse and cynologous monkey Fc\u03b3Rs as determined from Biacore.</p>Although the variants w"
