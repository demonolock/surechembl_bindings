    "24, 16-24, 16-21, 19-22, 33-40 and 33-42 of A\u03b2, for example D-mannitol at a concentration of about 2% w/v to about 6%, for example histidine at a concentration of about 0.1 mM to about 25 mM, methionine at a concentration of about 0.1 mM to about 25 mM, and a stabilizer. Preferably, the stabilizer is polysorbate 80 at a concentration of about 0.001% to about 0.01% w/v.</p>The formulation can be a stabilized liquid polypeptide formulation designed to provide stability and to maintain the biological activity of the incorporated polypeptide. The formulation includes a therapeutically active A\u03b2-binding polypeptide and an antioxidant in an amount sufficient to reduce the by-product formation of the polypeptide during storage of the formulation.</p>Some of the liquid polypeptide formulations are stabilized against the formation of undesired by-products such as high molecular weight polypeptide aggregates, low molecular weight polypeptide degradation products, or mixtures thereof.</p>In formulations wherein the therapeutic antigen-binding polypeptide is an antibody, the typical high molecular weight aggregates to be minimized are, for example, antibody:antibody complexes, antibody:antibody fragment complexes, antibody fragment:antibody fragment complexes, or mixtures thereof. In general, high molecular weight complexes or by-products have a molecular weight greater than a monomer of the antigen-binding polypeptide, for example, in the case of an IgG antibody, greater than about 150 kD. In such antibody formulations, the typical low molecular weight polypeptide degradation products to be minimized are, for example, complexes consisting of an antibody light chain, an antibody heavy chain, an antibody light chain and heavy chain complex, or mixtures thereof. In general, low molecular weight complexes or by-products have a molecular weight less than that of a monomer of the antigen-binding polypeptide, for example, in the case of an IgG antibody, less than about 150 kD.</p>A preferred stabilized formulation of an anti-A\u03b2 antibody includes methionine as an antioxidant in an amount sufficient to inhibit the formation of undesired by-products, a tonicity agent for example in an amount sufficient to render the formulation suitable for administration, and an amino acid for example or derivative thereof in an amount sufficient to maintain a physiologically suitable pH.</p>Some formulations are stable when frozen. The formulation can be suitable for administering parenterally, intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intracranially, or epidurally, preferably intravenously or subcutaneously. Some formulations can be suitable for targeted delivery to the brain or the spinal fluid of a subject. The formulation can be substantially free of preservatives. Some formulations are stable for at least about 12 months, at least about 18 months, at least about 24 months, or at least about 30 months. Some formulations are stable at about \u221280\u00b0 C. to about 40\u00b0 C., at about 0\u00b0 C. to about 25\u00b0 C., at about 0\u00b0 C. to about 10\u00b0 C., preferably at about \u221280\u00b0 C. to about \u221250\u00b0 C. or at about 2\u00b0 C. to about 8\u00b0 C.</p>Some formulations are stable for at least about 12 months at a temperature of above freezing to about 10\u00b0 C. and has a pH of about 5.5 to about 6.5. Such formulation includes at least one A\u03b2 antibody at a concentration of about 1 mg/ml to about 30 mg/ml, mannitol at a concentration of about 4% w/v or NaCl at a concentration of about 150 mM, histidine",
    "ion may be kept at a higher or \u201caccelerated\u201d temperature, for example, 40\u00b0 C. for 2 weeks to 1 month or more at which time stability is measured. In exemplary embodiments, the formulation is refractory to the formation of by-products of the component polypeptide, for example, high molecular weight aggregation products, low molecular weight degradation or fragmentation products, or mixtures thereof. The term \u201cstability\u201d refers to the length of time over which a molecular species such as an antibody retains its original chemical identity, for example, primary, secondary, and/or tertiary structure.</p>The term \u201cby-product\u201d includes undesired products, which detract, or diminish the proportion of therapeutic polypeptide in a given formulation. Typical by-products include aggregates of the therapeutic polypeptide, fragments of the therapeutic polypeptide (for example, produced by degradation of the polypeptide by deamidation or hydrolysis), or mixtures thereof.</p>The term \u201chigh molecular weight polypeptide aggregates\u201d includes aggregates of the therapeutic polypeptide, fragments of the therapeutic polypeptide (for example, produced by degradation of the polypeptide by, for example, hydrolysis), or mixtures thereof, that then aggregate. Typically, high molecular weight aggregates are complexes which have a molecular weight which is greater than the therapeutic monomer polypeptide. In the case of an antibody, for example, an IgG antibody, such aggregates are greater than about 150 kD. However, in the case of other therapeutic polypeptides, for example, single-chain antibodies, which typically have a molecular weight of 25 kD, such aggregates would have a molecular weight greater than about 25 kD.</p>The term \u201clow molecular weight polypeptide degradation product\u201d includes, for example, fragments of the therapeutic polypeptide, for example, brought about by deamidation or hydrolysis. Typically, low molecular weight degradation products are complexes which have a molecular weight which is less than the therapeutic monomer polypeptide. In the case of an antibody, for example, an IgG antibody, such degradation products are less than about 150 kD. However, in the case of other therapeutic polypeptides, for example, single-chain antibodies, which typically have a molecular weight of 25 kD, such aggregates would have a molecular weight less than about 25 kD.</p>The term \u201cadministration route\u201d includes art recognized administration routes for delivering a therapeutic polypeptide such as, for example, parenterally, intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intracranially, or epidurally. For the administration of a therapeutic polypeptide for the treatment of a neurodegenerative disease, intravenous, epidural, or intracranial routes, may be desired.</p>The term \u201ctreatment\u201d as used herein, is defined as the application or administration of a therapeutic agent to a patient, or application or administration of a therapeutic agent to an isolated tissue or cell line from a patient, who has a disease, a symptom of disease or a predisposition toward a disease, with the purpose to cure, heal, alleviate, delay, relieve, alter, remedy, ameliorate, improve or affect the disease, the symptoms of disease or the predisposition toward disease.</p>The term \u201ceffective dose\u201d or \u201ceffective dosage\u201d is defined as an amount sufficient to achieve or at least partially achieve the desired effect. The term \u201ctherapeutically effective dose\u201d is defined as an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the disease and its complications in a patient already suffering from the disease. Amounts effective for this use will depend upon the severity of the infection and the general state of the patient's own immune system.</p>The term \u201cpatient\u201d includes human and other mammalian subjects that receive either prophylactic or therapeutic treatment.<"
