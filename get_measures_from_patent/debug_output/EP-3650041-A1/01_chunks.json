    " of OspA sequence of Blip OspA 5/3 with the modified molecule lipB sOspA 5/3. The top strand is the original sequence (SEQ ID NO: 46) and the bottom strand is the optimized sequence (SEQ ID NO: 47).Figure 19 shows the distribution of functional anti-OspA responses in antibody surface binding and growth inhibition assays among protected and infected animals immunized with 3 ng of OspA 1/2 before challenge with B. burgdorferi s.s. B31 strain. Mann-Whitney p values demonstrated a highly significant difference in functional antibody content between protected and infected animals.Figure 20 shows the distribution of functional anti-OspA responses in antibody surface binding and growth inhibition assays among protected and infected animals immunized with 3 ng of OspA 1/2 before challenge with feral ticks. Mann-Whitney p values demonstrated a highly significant difference in functional antibody content between protected and infected animals.Figure 21 shows surface binding (mean fluorescence intensities (MFI)) and growth inhibition (GI-50 titers) in pooled mouse sera after immunization with three doses of the 3-component chimeric OspA vaccine. Efficient surface binding and growth inhibition were detected against all six Borrelia strains expressing OspA types homologous to the OspA types in the vaccine (types 1-6).Figure 22 shows mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) titers that were obtained using day 42 sera from individual mice immunized with combinations of rOspA vaccines in a surface binding assay (SBA). Results showed that all three rOspA components (1/2, 6/4, and 5/3) are required in a multivalent vaccine to induce high titers of surface binding IgG antibodies against all 6 strains in C3H mice. Two-component vaccines did not fully cover the 2 missing strains.Figure 23 shows the growth inhibition of Borreliae using day 42 sera from individual mice (in groups of 10) immunized with combinations of rOspA vaccines. Only the multivalent vaccine (the vaccine comprising all three strains) gave &gt;50% growth inhibition in &gt;90% of the animals (n=10). Bars in black (solid bars) indicate the strains homologous to the vaccine used.Figure 24 shows the coverage of Borreliae expressing intra-type variants of OspA. Surface binding was categorized into strong (fluorescence increased &gt;10-fold) or weaker (fluorescence increased 2-10-fold).</p>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONThe invention provides chimeric OspA molecules that are useful as antigens that can be delivered as an immunogenic composition or vaccine composition for Lyme disease or a Borrelia infection. Before any embodiments of the invention are explained in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the figures and examples. The section headings used herein are for organizational purposes only and are not to be construed as limiting the sub",
    "s epidemiological studies have shown, theoretically covers over 99% of isolates causing human disease in Europe and North America and, thus, is highly effective in preventing Lyme Borreliosis.</p>EXAMPLE 14:A VACCINE COMPRISING THE THREE COMPONENT VACCINE (OSPA 1/2, OSPA 6/4, AND OSPA 5/3) IS REQUIRED TO OPTIMALLY COVER BORRELIA EXPRESSING OSPA TYPES 1-6The purpose of this study was to investigate and compare the immunogenicity and the cross strain coverage of functional surface binding and/or growth inhibiting antibodies induced by single and multi-component formulations of rOspA Lyme Borreliosis vaccine, again using the efficiency of anti-OspA antibodies to bind to the surface of live Borreliae and to inhibit growth of Borreliae in vitro as correlates of protection</p>Immunization of mice. Ten female mice (C3H) per group were immunized with 0.1 \u00b5g of a single component vaccine comprising rOspA 1/2 antigen, rOspA 6/4 antigen, or rOspA 5/3 antigen; a two-component vaccine comprising 0.1 \u00b5g of both 1/2 + 5/3 antigens, 1/2 + 6/4 antigens, or 5/3 + 6/4 antigens; or a three-component vaccine comprising a combination 0.1 \u00b5g of all three 1/2+ 5/3+ 6/4 antigens adjuvanted with 0.2% AI(OH)3 in a prime-booster regimen. Vaccination was carried out subcutaneously using a dose volume of 200 \u00b5l on days 0, 14 and 28. On day 42, individual blood samples were taken from mice to generate sera.</p>Antibody suface binding and growth inhibition assays. A slightly modified version of the surface binding assay was used to determine the efficiency of anti-OspA IgG to bind to the surface of live Borreliae. Serial dilutions of a serum pool with defined MFI titers were included in the analyses to create a standard curve from which relative titers of test sera were read off after interpolation with a non-linear regression curve. The MFI titer of standard serum for the individual strains expressing OspA types 1-6 was defined as the highest dilution at which the fluorescence intensity of the Borreliae was determined to be at least 3-fold over the fluorescence intensity observed with normal mouse serum. All determinations were carried out in duplicate.</p>The scatter plots presented in Figure 22 compare the MFI titers to the six strain expressing homologous OspA types observed for the immune sera of individual C3H mice after immunization with either single rOspA antigens or rOspA antigen combinations. Results showed that a formulation containing all three rOspA antigens (1/2, 5/3 and 6/4) was necessary to induce high MFI titers against all six Borrelia strains expressing OspA types 1-6, and that formulations composed of two rOspA antigens (i.e. covering four strains) did not fully cover the strains expressing the two OspA types not present in the formulation.</p>To determine the potency of the various vaccine combinations to induce growth inhibiting antibodies, six representative Borreliae strains (B31, Arcon, PBr, DK6, W, KL11), expressing OspA types 1-6 respectively, were c",

A slightly modified version of the surface binding assay described above is used to determine the efficiency of anti-OspA IgG to bind to the surface of live Borreliae.

All sera are tested at a single dilution. The following dilutions are used: B31, PBr and KL11 1:200, Arcon, DK6 and W 1:100. PBr is cultured in the absence of 20% complement, while the other 5 strains are tested in the presence of complement. Baby rabbit complement is used for DK6, W and KL11, while guinea pig serum is used for B31 and Arcon. When the bacteria in the control cultures incubated with non- immune sera has grown sufficiently, as determined microscopically, accurate cell counts are made as described "
