J. Respir. Crit. Care Med., vol. 162, pp. 1455-1461 (2000), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, with minor modifications. The tests were performed on Sprague-Dawley male rats (200 g). Intratracheal instillation of LPS resulted in a statistically significant increase in neutrophil concentration in BALF, a hallmark of acute ongoing pulmonary inflammation.</p>For the dose of glucocorticoid producing a 75% inhibition (ED75 dose) assessment test, compounds (0.01-1 \u03bcmoles/Kg of body weight) were administered intratracheally as suspension (0.2% Tween 80 in NaCl 0.9%) 1 hour before LPS challenge. A dose-response curve of the inhibitory effect of the test compounds on LPS-induced lung neutrophilia was performed and the ED50 dose of glucocorticoid was taken as a measure of potency in this bioassay. The ED50 dose values for some representative compounds of the present invention were comprised between 0.05 and 0.16 \u03bcmoles/Kg of body weight.</p>In a second series of experiments, aimed at the evaluation of the duration of action, the compounds were administered as suspension intratracheally, at the ED75 dose, administered 24 h before LPS challenge. The most interesting compounds were active (percent of inhibition higher than 50%) when administered 24 hours before LPS challenge.</p>In Vitro StudiesExample 7Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) Translocation Assay ProtocolA quantitative measurement of GR nuclear translocation of the compounds of the present invention was performed according to ASSAY Drug Devel. Technol., 4(3), pp. 263-272 (2006), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, through a novel cell-based GR-translocation assay in Enzyme Fragment Complementation (EFC) format developed by DiscoveRx (Fremont, Calif.). In the absence of the glucocorticoid, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) resides in the cytosol complexed with a variety of proteins including heat shock proteins. When a glucocorticoid diffuses through the cell membrane into the cytoplasm and binds to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), it results in release of the heat shock proteins and the translocation into the nucleus where it modulates gene transcription.</p>The DiscoveRx assay uses EFC of b-galactosidase (b-gal) as an indicator of GR-translocation in engineered CHO-K1 biosensor cells. The enzyme acceptor (EA) fragment of b-gal resides in the nucleus, as designed through the use of a proprietary set of sequence additions and modifications. The small peptide enzyme donor (ED) fragment of b-gal was fused directly to the C-terminus of GR, and was localized in the cytoplasm in the absence of receptor signaling. Upon binding to a GR ligand, the complex translocates to the nucleus, where intact enzyme activity was restored by complementation and b-gal activity was detected.</p>CHO-K1 cells stably expressing NLS-enzyme acceptor fragment (EA) of b-gal and GR-enzyme donor (ED) fragment of b-gal were maintained in F12 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) at 37\u00b0 C. under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>and 95% air. The medium contained 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 U/ml penicillin 50 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, and 250 \u03bcg/ml hygromycin and 500 \u03bcg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). GR-translocation was measured using the PathHunter Detection Kit containing cell membrane permeabilizing reagent and beta-gal substrate (DiscoveRx, Fremont, Calif.). All compounds were screened using varying concentrations ranging from 10<sup>\u221211 </sup>to 10<sup>\u22126 </sup>M. The assay was performed in 48-wells (105 cells/well). Incubation with screened compounds was performed at 37\u00b0 C. for two hours. Detection was made by adding the detection buffer from the kit supplied by DiscoveRx and incubating at RT for one hour. Luminescence was detected by using a CENTRO LB 960 microplate reader (Berthold Technologies). Statistical analysis and determinations of EC50s were performed by using Prism-version 3.0 Graphpad Software (San Diego, Calif.). Some representative compounds of the invention assayed with the GR translocation displayed a EC50 comprised between 3.2 nM and 207 nM.</p>Example 8Inhibition of LPS-Induced Nitric Oxide Production in RAW 264.7 MacrophagesAn in vitro model based on macrophagic murine cell line RAW 264.7 was used for testing the anti-inflammatory effects of the corticosteroids of the present invention. During the inflammatory process, large amounts of nitric oxide (NO) were generated by the inducible isoforms of NO synthase (iNOS). Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was commonly used in experimental settings to stimulate inflammatory responses in macrophages.</p>Cells were grown in a culture medium (RPMI supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin) without phenol red. Cell stimulation was elicited by incubating cells for 24 hours with LPS to final concentrations ranging from 100 ng/ml. Treatments with the compounds of the invention were carried out by adding such compounds vehicled in DMSO (0.1% final concentration) to the final desired concentrations 15 minutes before LPS exposure. As an index of nitric oxide production, the concentration of nitrite was measured in the conditioned media by using the Griess colorimetric reaction (see J. Neuroimmunol., vol. 150, pp. 29-36 (2004), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).</p>Statistical analysis and determinations of IC50s were performed by using Prism-version 3.0 Graphpad Software (San Diego, Calif.). The IC50 values tested on some representative compounds of the invention were comprised between 12.2 and 151 nM.</p>Example 9Interleukin-8 (IL-8) Release Assay ProtocolIn order to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of novel inhaled corticosteroids, a selection of these compounds in inhibiting TNF\u03b1-induced IL-8 release from human airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) was assessed. hASMCs exposed to a variety of inflammatory mediators (Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2) can undergo phenotypic changes and secrete chemokines and cytokines, which may participate in or even perpetuate mucosal inflammatory changes via activation and recruitment of inflammatory cells (see Damera et al., 2009; Howarth et al., 2004; Chung, 2000; Koyama et al., 2000, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties).</p>Current evidence suggests that chemokines and cytokines secretion induced by inflammatory mediators is inhibited by glucocorticoids in hASMCs and lung fibroblasts (see John et al., 1998; Spoelstra et al., 2002; Tobler et al., 1992, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties). Steroids may inhibit the cytokine-induced secretion of chemokines by a direct inhibitory interaction between activated glucocorticoid receptors and activated transcription factors, such as nuclear factor-kappa B and activator protein-1 which modulated inflammatory gene expression. In addition, glucocorticoids can regulate chemokine expression by reducing mRNA stability through the rapid induction of potent endogenous inhibitor of p38 MAP Kinase, MKP-1, which is one of the genes trans-activated by steroids (see King et al., 2009, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).</p>Primary human airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) were purchased from LONZA (Basel, CH) and cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>at 37\u00b0 C. ASMCs were seeded in 0.5 ml DMEM containing 10% FBS in 48-well tissue culture plates at the density of 104 cells/well and grown for 24 hours at 37\u00b0 C. with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Then cells were serum starved for 18 hours before treatment with different concentration of LAGRA (10-12M-10-6M, final DMSO concentration 0.1%) for 60 min before stimulation with TNF\u03b1 (0.1 ng/ml as final concentration for ASMCs). After 18 hours incubation in DMEM serum free, the IL8 release in the supernatant was assayed using ELISA kit (Invitrogen). Compound potencies were expresses as concentration able to inhibit the half maximal (50%) IL8 release [IC50] in the dose-response curve obtained after stimulation with TNF\u03b1.</p>All values stated are mean\u00b1standard error of mean (SEM). Compound potencies (expresses as half maximal (50%) inhibitory concentration [IC50]) were derived from a four-parameter non-linear iterative curve-fitting analysis using Prism software (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, Calif.). Statistical analysis, Sigmoid curves design and analysis were performed by using Prism software (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, Calif.).</p>Where a numerical limit or range is stated herein, the endpoints are included. Also, all values and subranges within a numerical limit or range are specifically included as if explicitly written out.</p>As used herein the words \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d and the like carry the meaning of \u201cone or more.\u201d</p>Obviously, numerous modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings.
