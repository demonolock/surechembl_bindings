    "l or NK cell transplantation. </p>[0027] The term \u201cantibody\u201d (Ab) includes, without limitation, a glycoprotein immunoglobulin which binds specifically to an antigen. In general, and antibody can comprise at least two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains interconnected by disulfide bonds, or an antigen-binding molecule thereof. Each H chain comprises a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VH) and a heavy chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region comprises three constant domains, CHI, CH2 and CH3. Each light chain comprises a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VL) and a light chain constant region. The light chain constant region is comprises one constant domain, CL. The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions (CDRs), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each VH and VL comprises three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, and FR4. The variable regions of the heavy and light chains contain a binding domain that interacts with an antigen. The constant regions of the Abs may mediate the binding of the immunoglobulin to host tissues or factors, including various cells of the immune system (e.g, effector cells) and the first component (Clq) of the classical complement system. In general, human antibodies are approximately 150 kD tetrameric agents composed of two identical heavy (H) chain polypeptides (about 50 kD each) and two identical light (L) chain polypeptides (about 25 kD each) that associate with each other into what is commonly referred to as a \u201cY-shaped\u201d structure. The heavy and light chains are linked or connected to one another by a single disulfide bond; two other disulfide bonds connect the heavy chain hinge regions to one another, so that the dimers are connected to one another and the tetramer is formed. Naturally-produced antibodies are also glycosylated, e.g, on the CH2 domain. [0028] The term \u201chuman antibody\u201d is intended to comprise antibodies having variable and constant domain sequences generated, assembled, or derived from human immunoglobulin sequences, or sequences indistinguishable therefrom. In some embodiments, antibodies (or antibody components) may be considered to be \u201chuman\u201d even though their amino acid sequences comprise residues or elements not encoded by human germline immunoglobulin sequences (e.g, variations introduced by in vitro random or site-specific mutagenesis or introduced by in vivo somatic mutation). The term \u201chumanized\u201d is intended to comprise antibodies having a variable domain with a sequence derived from a variable domain of a non -human species (e.g, a mouse), modified to be more similar to a human germline encoded sequence. In some embodiments, a \u201chumanized\u201d antibody comprises one or more framework domains having substantially the amino \n\nacid sequence of a human framework domain, and one or more complementary determining regions having substantially the amino acid sequence as that of a non-human a",

For example, the engineered autologous cell therapy (eACT\u2122) method described herein involves collection of lymphocytes from a patient, which are then engineered to express, e.g ., a CAR construct, and then administered back to the same patient. </p>[0049] \u201cBinding affinity\u201d generally refers to the strength of the sum total of non-covalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g, an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g, an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise \u201cbinding affinity\u201d refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1:1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g, antibody and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>). Affinity can be measured and/or expressed in a number of ways known in the art, including, but not limited to, equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>), and equilibrium association constant (KA). The K<sub>D</sub> is calculated from the quotient of k<sub>0ff</sub>/k<sub>0n</sub>, whereas KA is calculated from the quotient of k<sub>0n</sub>/k<sub>0ff</sub>. k<sub>on</sub> refers to the association rate constant of, e.g, an antibody to an antigen, and k<sub>off</sub> refers to the dissociation of, e.g, an antibody to an antigen. The k<sub>on</sub> and k<sub>0ff</sub> can be determined by techniques known to one of ordinary skill in the art, such as BIACORE<sup>\u00ae</sup> or KinExA. </p>[0050] The term \"KD\" (M) refers to the dissociation equilibrium constant of a particular antibody- antigen interaction, or the dissociation equilibrium constant of an antibody or antibody-binding fragment binding to an antigen. There is an inverse relationship between K<sub>D</sub> and binding affinity, therefore the smaller the K<sub>D</sub> value, the higher, i.e., stronger, the affinity. Thus, the terms \u201chigher affinity\u201d or \u201cstronger affinity\u201d relate to a higher ability to form an interaction and therefore a smaller K<sub>D</sub> value, and conversely the terms \u201clower affinity\u201d or \u201cweaker affinity\u201d relate to a lower ability to form an interaction and therefore a larger K<sub>D</sub> value. In some circumstances, a higher binding affinity (or K<sub>D</sub>) of a particular molecule (e.g. antibody) to its interactive partner molecule (e.g. antigen X) compared to the binding affinity of the molecule (e.g. antibody) to another interactive partner molecule (e.g. antigen Y) may be expressed as a binding ratio determined by dividing the larger K<sub>D</sub> value (lower, or weaker, affinity) by the smaller K<sub>D</sub> (higher, or stronger, affinity), for example expressed as 5-fold or 10-fold greater binding affinity, as the case may be. [0051] The term \"k<sub>d</sub>\" (sec -1 or 1/s) refers to the dissociation rate constant of a particular antibody- antigen interaction, or the dissociation rate constant of an antibody or antibody -binding fragment. Said value is also referred to as the koir va",
    "bl-1 scFv-Fc, which indicated that mAbl-1 binds to an epitope on rhGPC3, including the amino acids Thr55, Lys68, Ser74, Arg75, Lys80, Thr84, Arg258, and Ser263, where the amino acid positions are numbered as in the Uniprot database for entry Q8IYG2 (Q 81 Y G2 HUM AN) (UniProt Consortium, 2021). </p>Example 13 </p>Measurement of mAbl-1 GPC3 Affinity </p>[0310] A kinetics constant for mAbl-1 scFv mFc binding to its target, GPC3, was determined using a Sartorius Octet Red96 with AMC biosensors. mAbl-1 scFv-Fc was diluted to 2ug/mL and captured onto 7 AMC biosensor tips under agitation. One biosensor was left blank as a reference. Two lots of recombinant human GPC3(Q25-H559)-6xHis (rhGPC3) at 464.3, 154.8, 51.59, 17.2, 5.73, 1.911 and 0 nM were used as analytes. The association phase was measured for 90 sec and the dissociation was measured for 120 sec. All measurements were corrected for baseline drift by subtracting a control sensor exposed to running buffer only. The data were analyzed using a 1:1 interaction model with global fitting for each analyte lot separately, using Octet analysis software. \n\n[0311] For the YP7 scFv mFc assay, YP7 scFv mFc was captured onto a single AMC biosensor tip and binding to rhGPC3 was assessed at a single 500 nM concentration. The association phase was measured for 90 sec and the dissociation was measured for 120 sec. The data for YP7 was analyzed using a 1 : 1 interaction model, using individual fitting for the single concentration. [0312] The KD values of mAbl-1 scFv-Fc to lots 1 and 2 of rhGPC3 were determined to be 32.7 and 35.2nM, respectively. While these values show good reproducibility, the fitting indicated that there may be some complex binding in the interaction measured. From a single concentration of analyte the KD value of YP7 to rhGPC3 was 8.73nM. </p>Table 23 \n\n </p>Example 14 </p>Binding of mAbl-1 and YP7 to off-target proteins expressed on plasma membrane [0313] mAbl-1 and YP7 scFv-Fcs were screened for binding to a library of plasma membrane proteins individually expressed HEK293 cells. HEK293 cells were reverse transfected in duplicate on microarray slides spotted with expression vectors encoding ZsGreen followed by one of 5484 human plasma membrane proteins or cell surface-tethered secreted proteins. Additional slides were coarrayed with vectors encoding 371 heterodimers. As a positive control to ensure that the minimal level of transfection was achieved, each slide included cells reverse transfected with hEGFR-IRES-ZsGreenl in quadruplicate. Microarrays were fixed and stained with the scFvs and anti-EGFR and binding was detected with a fluorescent secondary antibody. Primary hits identified in the initial screen were confirmed in a secondary screen alongside additional controls; Vectors encoding the primary hits were re-arrayed and expressed in HEK293 cells on new slides and screening was performed on fixed and unfixed cells. Medium-strong binding to GPC3 was detected for both targets. Off-target weak binding of YP7 to CSPG5 (isoforms 1 and 2) was detected and confirmed. Off-target weak binding of mAbl-1 to CDH1 was detected and confirmed in the secondary screen and by flowcytometry analysis of transfected HEK293 cells. \n\nTable 24 \n\n \n\n</p>Example 15 </p>Cross Reactivity of "
