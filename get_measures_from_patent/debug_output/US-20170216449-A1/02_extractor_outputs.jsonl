{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n1. In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein has a dissociation constant (Kd) of equal to or less than about 100 nM, 10 nM, 1 nM, 0.1 nM, 0.01 nM, or 0.001 nM (e.g. 10<sup>\u22127</sup>M or less, from 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>M to 10<sup>\u221213</sup>M, from 10<sup>\u22128</sup>M to 10<sup>\u221213 </sup>M or from 10<sup>\u22129</sup>M to 10<sup>\u221213 </sup>M).\n2. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% polysorbate 20 (TWEEN-20\u2122) surfactant (PBST) at 25\u00b0 C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 \u03bcl/min.\n3. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) is calculated as the ratio koff/kon.\n4. If the on-rate exceeds 10<sup>6</sup> M\u22121 s\u22121 by the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation=295 nm; emission=340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25\u00b0 C. of a 20 nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow equipped spectrophometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-AMINCO\u2122 spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stirred cuvette.\n\nNote that sentence 3 does not contain a specific molecule name or identifier, but it is related to the calculation of Kd, which is mentioned in sentence 1. Sentence 4 mentions a specific concentration (20 nM) and a technique, but it does not explicitly mention a molecule name or identifier. However, it is related to the measurement of on-rate, which is connected to the calculation of Kd. \n\nOnly sentence 1 and 2 contain all the required components: a specific bioactivity metric (Kd), a numeric value (e.g., 100 nM, 0.78 nM), and a unit (nM). Sentence 1 refers to a general antibody, while sentence 2 refers to a specific Fab. \n\n Sentence 1 and 2 are the most relevant sentences."}
