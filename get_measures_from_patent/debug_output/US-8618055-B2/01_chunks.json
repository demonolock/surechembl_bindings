    "e 1), an endogenous pro-angiogenesis factor that is important for normal growth and development but is also involved during unwanted and aberrant vascularization such as in cancer and diabetic retinopathy. In addition, the short peptides promoted VEGF binding to other cell types, promoted proliferation of endothelial cells in vitro, and enhanced angiogenesis and cell migration in the presence of VEGF. These short peptides with regenerative and/or pro-angiogenic properties are useful in promoting angiogenesis, such as in wound healing, burns, tissue repair, fertility treatments, myocardial infarction, hypertrophied hearts, revascularization of tissue after disease and trauma (e.g., stroke, ischemic limbs, vascular diseases, bone repair), tissue grafts and tissue engineered constructs. Further, because the peptides and peptide derivatives described herein potentiate the effects of VEGF, they are also to be considered for their effects on other activities mediated by VEGF. For example, VEGF is a neurotrophic factor that exhibits neuroprotective properties.

The exact function of prominin is unknown although in humans, defects in PROM1, the gene coding for prominin, cause retinal degeneration.</p>Prom-1 expression is also associated with cancer; many leukemias express prom-1 as well as CD34. It is believed that colon cancer is initiated and propagated by a small number of undifferentiated tumorigenic prom-1+ cells. Prom-1 mRNA expression is increased in cancer patients with metastatic disease, specifically with bone metastasis. In addition, prom-1 mRNA expression seems to be an independent prognostic factor for overall survival.</p>One of the reasons why prom-1 can promote cancer and/or metastasis is that the intact full length prom-1 enhances the angiogenesis properties of VEGF and therefore is pro-angiogenic. This characteristic of prom-1 could certainly support the pathological angiogenesis associated with cancer and metastasis. Treatment options that specifically target the prom-1 protein and its expression are currently under study and include blocking activity with anti-prom-1 antibody and inhibiting expression by siRNA.</p>Provided herein are peptides derived from a prominin polypeptide that has regenerative and/or pro-angiogenic activities.</p>Accordingly, embodiments of the present invention provide isolated peptide fragments derived from prominin-1 (prom-1), the peptides having regenerative, pro-angiogenic activity and/or VEGF-binding activity as measured by an in vitro ELISA-based VEGF-binding assay.

No. 9) or a conservative substitution variant thereof.</p>Encompassed herein is an isolated peptide that is a VEGF-binding conservative substitution variant of a peptide with regenerative and/or pro-angiogenic activity as measured by an in vitro ELISA-based VEGF-binding assay as described herein. Conservative amino acid residue substitution is well known in the art. Conservative amino acid substitutions replace an amino acid with another amino acid of similar chemical structure. Examples of such substitution are glycine for alanine, leucine for valine, serine for threonine, and aspartate for glutamate. For example, SEQ ID NO: 4 can be altered to a peptide VCGNSFSGGQPS (SEQ ID NO: 55), LCANSFSGGQPS (SEQ ID NO: 56), or LCGNSFSAGQPS (SEQ ID NO: 57), or LCGNSFSGAQPS (SEQ ID NO: 58) where the residues that are in bold and italicized are changed. In one embodiment, only one of the amino acids is substituted with a conservative substitution. In another embodiment, two substitutions can be made. In other embodiments, up to four amino acids are substituted. Conservative substitutions typically include substitutions within the following groups: glycine, alanine; valine, isoleucine, leucine; aspartic acid, glutamic acid, asparagine, glutamine; serine, threonine; lysine, arginine; and phenylalanine, tyrosine. Conservative amino acid substitutions do not change the overall structure of the peptide nor the type of amino acid side chains available for forming van der Waals bonds with a binding partner. Conservative amino acid substitution can be achieved during chemical synthesis of the peptide by adding the desired substitute amino acid at the appropriate sequence in the synthesis process. Alternatively, molecular biology methods can be used. The "
