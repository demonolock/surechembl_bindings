    "ther techniques such as the human B-cell hybridoma technique (Kozbor et al., Immunol. Today 4:72 (1983)), the EBV-hybridoma technique to produce human monoclonal antibodies (Roder et al., Methods Enzymol, 121:140-67 (1986)), and screening of combinatorial antibody libraries (Huse et al., Science 246:1275 (1989)). Hybridoma cells can be screened immunochemically for production of antibodies specifically reactive with cancer cells and the monoclonal antibodies can be isolated.</p>Specific antibodies, or antibody fragments, reactive against particular antigens or molecules, such as antigens or molecules on a cancer cell, may also be generated by screening expression libraries encoding immunoglobulin genes, or portions thereof, expressed in bacteria with cell surface components. For example, complete Fab fragments, VH regions and FV regions can be expressed in bacteria using phage expression libraries (See for example Ward et al., Nature 341:544-546 (1989); Huse et al., Science 246:1275-1281 (1989); and McCafferty et al., Nature 348:552-554 (1990)).</p>The present application includes all antibodies and antibody fragments that bind to the same antigen as the antibodies or antibody fragments of the present application. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that binding assays can be used to find other antibodies and antibody fragments with the same binding specificities as the antibodies and antibody fragments of the present application. As exemplified, below, a competition binding assay can be used to find such other antibodies.</p>Before a competition assay is performed using flow cytometry, the minimal concentration of antibody of the present application (Ab1) that gives maximal binding against a fixed number of cancer cells is determined. A total of 106 cells are harvested from exponentially growing cultures and incubated with various antibody concentrations for 1 hr at 4\u00b0 C. The cells are washed and incubated with a suitable detection antibody for an additional hour at 4\u00b0 C. After washing, the cells are analyzed by flow cytometry. For each test antibody, a saturation curve is generated from the data by plotting median fluorescence against the antibody concentration.</p>For the competition assay, cancer cells are prepared as above and treated in duplicate with a fixed concentration of antibody (Ab1). The fixed concentration is the minimal concentration of antibody that generates maximal binding against a fixed number of cancer cells as determined above. Immediately following the addition of the Ab1, varying concentrations of the potential inhibitory antibody (Ab2) is added to each tube and the mixture incubated for 1 hr at 4\u00b0 C. Both the percent inhibition and change over maximum median fluorescence are calculated by subtracting the background fluorescence (PBS-5% FCS) from the median fluorescence reading for each test sample (Ab1+Ab2). The result is then divided by the median fluorescence of Ab1 alone (maximal binding) minus the background ",
    "ermine if the cell-surface bound VB1-204 internalizes, direct visualization of fluorescence distribution and intracellular staining with the aid of laser scanning confocal microscopy was used. A-375 cells were incubated with VB1-204 (100 \u03bcg/mL) or control antibody at 4\u00b0 C. After washing the cells, half of the sample was warmed at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 hr, the other half stayed at 4\u00b0 C. Fixed (with a solution of formaldehyde) and unfixed cells were labeled with fluorescein-labeled second antibody. As seen with the 5E9 positive control antibody, A-375 cells incubated with VB1-204 at 4\u00b0 C. for 60 min demonstrated circumferential surface distribution of fluorescence label (FIG. 3A). Warming the VB1-204-treated cells to 37\u00b0 C. revealed a pattern of intracellular staining within 60 minutes, as shown in FIG. 3B, indicating internalization of the VB1-204/antigen complex.</p>Example 5Binding Affinity of VB1-204Flow cytometry was used to assess binding affinity of VB1-204, A range of antibody concentrations were tested against a fixed number of tumor cells (A-375) for 2 hours to obtain a saturation curve. Values and graphical analysis were generated using Sigma Plot (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, Calif.). The inverse of the determined median fluorescence was plotted as a function of the inverse of antibody concentration to determine K<sub>D </sub>by the Lineweaver-Burk method. A straight line was generated and the K<sub>D </sub>was calculated from the slope of the curve (FIGS. 4A and 4B). The dissociation constant, K<sub>D </sub>value, was determined by the following equation: 1/F=1/Fmax+(K<sub>D</sub>/Fmax) (1/IgM), where F=background subtracted median fluorescence and Fmax was calculated from the plot. As shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B, the dissociation constant for VB1-204 was calculated to be 5\u00d710<sup>\u22129</sup>M.</p>Example 6Isolation and Identification of AntigenTumor cell lines A375 (melanoma), HepG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma), MB 231 (breast carcinoma) CF-PAC-1 and PANC-1 (pancreatic carcinoma) and DU-145 (prostate carcinoma) were used to isolate and identify the membrane associated antigen bound to VB1-204. These cell lines were selected based on the tumor cell profiling by flow cytometery. The cell lines were purchased from ATCC and cultured in accordance with the guidelines of ATCC.</p>Preliminary Characterization of the Antigen Binding to VB1-204VB1-204 was used to immunoprecipitate proteins from membrane extracts of tumor cell lines. The purified proteins were then separated on SDS-PAGE gels that were subsequently western blotted using VB1-204. A 65\u00b12 kDa band on was detected on 1D-PAGE in addition to a band at \u02dc34 kDa. After reduction of the purified proteins with 2% SDS for up to 60 minutes at 65\u00b0 C., all the bands collapsed into a single strong band at \u02dc34 kDa seen consistently in all the reactive cell lines. The data from these experiments classified the VB1-204 antigen as a \u201cblottable\u201d antigen with a N-glycan masked epitope. As can be seen in the FIGS. 5A and 5B a strong \u02dc34 kDa was observed in all the positive cell lines. The intensity of the band is also reflective of the level of antigen expression in that particular cell line.</p>Mass Spectral Analysis and Protein Identification.Proteins from t"
