    "bjected to a negative charge under neutral conditions resulting in electrostatic repulsion between complementary chains, the backbone structure of PNA does not inherently have a charge. Therefore, there is no electrostatic repulsion. Consequently, PNA has a higher ability to form double strands as compared with conventional nucleic acids, and has a high ability to recognize base sequences. Furthermore, PNAs are generally more robust than nucleic acids. PNAs may also be used in arrays and in other hybridization or other reactions as described above and herein for oligonucleotides.</p>As used herein, the term \u201cvector\u201d refers to a polynucleotide compound used for introducing exogenous or endogenous polynucleotide into host cells. A vector comprises a nucleotide sequence, which may encode one or more polypeptide molecules. Plasmids, cosmids, viruses and bacteriophages, in a natural state or which have undergone recombinant engineering, are non-limiting examples of commonly used vectors to provide recombinant vectors comprising at least one desired isolated polynucleotide molecule.</p>The nucleic acid molecules can be inserted into any suitable vector. Suitable vectors include, without limitation, viral vectors. Suitable viral vectors include, without limitation, retroviral vectors, alphaviral, vaccinial, adenoviral, adenoassociated viral, herpes viral, and fowl pox viral vectors. The vectors preferably have a native or engineered capacity to transform eukaryotic cells, e.g., CHO-Ki cells. Additionally, the vectors useful in the context of the invention can be \u201cnaked\u201d nucleic acid vectors (i.e., vectors having little or no proteins, sugars, and/or lipids encapsulating them) such as plasmids or episomes, or the vectors can be complexed with other molecules. Other molecules that can be suitably combined with the inventive nucleic acids include without limitation viral coats, cationic lipids, liposomes, polyamines, gold particles, and targeting moieties such as ligands, receptors, or antibodies that target cellular molecules.</p>Nonstandard amino acids may occur in nature, and may or may not be genetically encoded. Examples of genetically encoded nonstandard amino acids include selenocysteine, sometimes incorporated into some proteins at a UGA codon, which may normally be a stop codon, or pyrrolysine, sometimes incorporated into some proteins at a UAG codon, which may normally be a stop codon. Some nonstandard amino acids that are not genetically encoded may result from modification of standard amino acids already incorporated in a peptide, or may be metabolic intermediates or precursors, for example. Examples of nonstandard amino acids include 4-hydroxyproline, 5-hydroxylysine, 6-N-methyllysine, gamma-carboxyglutamate, desmosine, selenocysteine, ornithine, citrulline, lanthionine, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid, carnitine, sarcosine, or N-formylmethionine. Synthetic variants of standard and non-standard amino acids are al",

PE-labelled B1SP (BiSP-PE) was serially diluted and added to DU145 cells in triplicate wells for 1 hour. Cells were washed with DPBS before measurement of PE-Fluorescence intensity (FI). DU145 cells (2\u00d7105/ml) were plated in 12-well plates. Twenty-four hours later the cells were incubated with serial diluted BiSP-PE in DPBS/20 mM HEPES in a volume of 1.0 ml. Cells were incubated at 370C and 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>for 60 min. Cells were then washed three times with DPBS/HEPES and then gently scraped and transferred to Flow Cytometry tubes. The cells were centrifuged at 1300 rpm for 5 minutes and finally resuspended in 0.5 ml PBS containing 2% FBS. As control, the cells were treated in parallel with rhIgGFc (100 nM) and then stained with secondary antibody, anti-IgGFc-specific conjugated to PE. The level of staining of control cells at 100 nM rhIgGFc was 6.01% whereas the level of BiSP-PE staining at 100 nM was 89.7%. The relative binding of BiSP-PE was determined by Flow Cytometry on a Bectin Dickenson FACSCantoII Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences\u2122, Mississauga, On).</p>Assessment of In Vivo Tumor Growth for Castration-Resistant C4-2 (CRPC) Xenografts.</p>For C4-2 castration-resistant (CRPC) xenograft model, C4-2 cells (1\u00d710<sup>6</sup>) were inoculated subcutaneously in bilateral flank regions of 6-8 week-old male athymic nude mice (Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc.\u2122, Indianapolis, Ind.) via a 27-gauge needle under methoxyfluorane anesthesia.

LNCaP cells were transfected with either scramble siRNA (AUCAAACUGUUGUCAGCGCUGUU) (SEQ ID NO:7), PlexinB1siRNA1 (CCGGGUGGAAUUUAUCCUUGAUU) (SEQ ID NO:8), or, Plexin B1siRNA2 (ACCACGGUCACCCGGAUUCUU) (SEQ ID NO:9) (10 nM) using HiPerFect\u2122 reagent (Qiagen\u2122, Montreal PQ) as described by the manufacturer. Transfected cells were incubated for 72 hours and then incubated in the presence or absence of SEMA3C:Fc (100 nM) for 10 minutes. Cells were washed and then lysed. Plexin B1 levels were analyzed from lysates (30 \u03bcg) by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Western Blots were probed with anti-Plexin B1 and anti-phospho-Shc. Blots were re-probed with anti-vinculin and anti-She as loading control. DU145 cells were transfected with scramble siRNA, Plexin B1siRNA1 or PlexinB1 siRNA2 (10 nM) using RNAiMax\u2122 reagent as directed by the manufacturer, (Invitrogen\u2122, Missisauga, Ontario). Following 72 hours incubation the cells were replated at 20,000 cells/well in a 96-well flat bottom plate and let adhere for 4 hours. The remaining cells were lysed and assayed for PlexinB1 expression by Western Blot. The blot was reprobed with vinculin as loading control. Medium was replaced with DMEM without serum for 16 hours prior to the binding assay. Cells were then washed once with HBHA [20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>).1 mM MgCl2], buffer containing, 0.5% BSA. The Opti-MEM1-conditioned medium from 293T cells expressing either the APTag vector alone or, the AP-SEMA 3C construct was assayed in a PNPP assay to find the linear and equivalent range of AP-enzymatic activity. The AP-SEMA3C was applied by diluting an equal volume of AP-SEMA3C CM to an equal volume of HBHA buffer that gave an enzymatic activity of 0.877. The APTag was first diluted 1:4 in Opti-MEM and then an equal volume of the 1:4 diluted-APTag CM was diluted to an equal volume of HBHA. The enzymatic activity of AP-Tag CM was 1.069.</p>The binding assay was performed as previously described by FLANAGAN, JG. and LEDER, P. (1990), endogenous phosphatase heat inactivation was done in HBHA at 65\u00b0 C. following the fixation step. Plate readings at 562 nm were taken initially and then every 24 hours. The data was done in quadruplet. The binding of the APTag vector CM was subtracted from the binding to APSEMA3C in each case.</p>Apoptosis Assay</p>In FIG. 13, LNCaP and C4-2 cells (2.5\u00d7104) were plated in 6-well plates for twenty-four hrs when the medium was replaced with RPMI in the absence of Phenol red or serum. B1SP at the indicated concentrations was added and the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. and 5% CO2 for 4 days. The cells were harvested from medium and adherent cells by gentle scraping. The cells were then centrifuged at 1300 rpm, washed once in PBS and lysed with 200 \u03bcl NP40 lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. Samples (30 \u03bcg) were separated by SDS PAGE. The gel was immunoblotted with Total PARP and Cleaved PARP (9542, 9541, Cell Signaling Technologies Inc.\u2122, Beverly, Mass.). The blot was re-probed with anti-Actin to demonstrate equal loading of protein lysates.</p>In FIG. 14, PLA analysis was performed as previously described using the Duolink\u2122 in-situ PLA kit (Sigma-Aldrich\u2122, Oakville, ON), where C-terminal anti-PLEXIN B1 was used to distinguish the endogenous PLEXIN B1 and B1SP and Mouse Anti-HER2 were used.</p>EXAMPLESThe following working examples are provided for illustrative purposes, and are no",
