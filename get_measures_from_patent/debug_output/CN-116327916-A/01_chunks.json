    ", igD, igE, igG and IgM. Some of which are further divided into subclasses or isotypes, e.g., igG1, igG2, igG3, igG4, etc. An exemplary immunoglobulin (antibody) structural unit comprises a tetramer. Each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one \"light\" chain (about 25 kDa) and one \"heavy\" chain (about 50kDa-70 kDa). The N-terminus of each chain defines a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids, primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The term variable light chain (V <sub>L</sub> ) And a variable heavy chain (V <sub>H</sub> ) These light and heavy chains are referred to respectively. The heavy chain constant domains corresponding to the different classes of immunoglobulins are designated \"\u03b1\", \"\u03b4\", \"epsilon\", \"\u03b3\" and \"\u03bc\", respectively. Subunit structures of immunoglobulins of different classesAnd three-dimensional configurations are well known. IgG is an exemplary class of antibodies used herein because they are the most common antibodies under physiological conditions and are the easiest to prepare under laboratory conditions. Optionally, the antibody is a monoclonal antibody. Specific examples of antibodies are humanized, chimeric, human or other suitable human antibodies. \"antibody\" also includes any fragment or derivative of any of the antibodies described herein. </p>The term \"specifically binds\" means that an antibody can bind to a binding partner (e.g., NKG2A, PD-1, PD-L1) preferably in a competitive binding assay, as assessed using recombinant forms of the protein, or epitopes therein or native proteins present on the surface of an isolated target cell. Competitive binding assays and other methods for determining specific binding are well known in the art. For example, binding may be detected via radiolabeling, physical methods such as mass spectrometry, or direct or indirect fluorescent labeling using, for example, detection of cellular fluorescent assays (e.g., FACScan). The non-specific reagent indicates that the reagent binds to the target above the amount seen in the control. The agent that specifically binds NKG2A may bind NKG2A alone or as a dimer with CD 94.</p>When an antibody is said to \"compete\" with a particular monoclonal antibody, this means that the antibody competes with the monoclonal antibody in a binding assay for use of a recombinant molecule (e.g., NKG2A, PD-1, PD-L1) or a surface-expressed molecule (e.g., NKG2A, PD-1, PD-L1). For example, an antibody having the heavy chain of any one of SEQ ID NOS.4-8 and the light chain of SEQ ID NO. 9 is said to \"compete\" with such antibodies, respectively, if the test antibody reduces binding to the NKG2A polypeptide or cells expressing NKG2A in a binding assay. </p>The term \"affinity\" as used herein means the strength of binding of an antibody to an epitope. An antibody has affinity determined by dissociation constant Kd (defined as [ Ab]x[Ag]/[Ab-Ag]) Give, wherein [ Ab-Ag ]]Is the molar concentration of the antibody-antigen complex, [ Ab ]]Is the molar concentration of unbound antibody, and [ Ag ]]Is the molar concentration of unbound antigen. Affinity constant K <sub>a</sub> Defined by 1/Kd. Methods for determining mAb affinity can be found in HarLow et al Antibodies A Laboratory Manual [ Antibodies: laboratory manual]Cold spring harbor laboratory Press (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press), cold spring harbor, new York, 1988), coligan et al, edit Current Protocols in Immunology [ Current immunological protocol]Green publication association (Greene Publishing assoc.) and power publishing company (Wiley Interscience), new york (1992,1993), and Muller, meth]92:589-601 (1983), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. One standard method for determining mAb affinity, well known in the art, is to use Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) screening (e.g., by using BIAcore <sup>TM</sup> Analysis by SPR analysis apparatus).</p>In the context of this document, a \"determinant\" designates a site of interaction or binding on a polypeptide. </p>The term \"epitope\" refers to an antigenic determinant and is the area or region on an antigen to which an antibody binds. Protein epitopes may comprise amino acid residues that are directly involved in binding as well as amino acid residues that are effectively blocked by specific antigen-binding antibodies or peptides, i.e., amino acid residues within the \"footprint\" of the antibody. It is the simplest form or smallest structural region on a complex antigen molecule that can be associated with, for example, an antibody or receptor. Epitopes may be linear or conformational/structural. The term \"linear epitope\" is defined as an e",
    "ation to prevent the formation of half antibodies in vivo (fab arm exchange), e.g., the antibody comprises an IgG4 heavy chain comprising a serine to proline mutation in residue 241 (corresponding to position 228 according to the EU index) (Kabat et al, \"Sequences of proteins of immunological interest [ immunological protein sequence of interest ]\", 5 th edition, NIH, bezilda, maryland, 1991). Such modified IgG4 antibodies will remain intact in vivo and remain divalent (high affinity) to NKG2A, in contrast to native IgG4 that will undergo fab arm exchange in vivo, such that they bind NKG2A in a monovalent manner that can alter binding affinity. Alternatively, antibody fragments that do not contain constant regions (e.g., fab or F (ab') 2 fragments) can be used to avoid Fc receptor binding. Fc receptor binding can be assessed according to methods known in the art, including, for example, testing antibodies for binding to Fc receptor proteins in a BIACORE assay. In addition, any antibody type (e.g., igG1, igG2, igG3, or IgG 4) may be used, wherein the Fc portion is modified to minimize or eliminate binding to Fc receptors (see, e.g., WO 03101485, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference). Assays for assessing Fc receptor binding (e.g., cell-based assays) are well known in the art and are described, for example, in WO 03101485. </p>Thus, the present invention relates to antibodies or other agents that bind NKG2A. In one aspect, the antibody binds NKG2A with a KD at least 100-fold lower than human NKG2C and/or NKG 2E.</p>In one aspect of the invention, the agent reduces CD94/NKG 2A-mediated inhibition of CD94/NKG 2A-expressing lymphocytes by interfering with CD94/NKG2A signaling (e.g., by interfering with binding of NKG2A to HLA-E, preventing or inducing conformational changes in CD94/NKG2A receptor, and/or affecting dimerization and/or aggregation of CD94/NKG2A receptor).</p>In one aspect of the invention, the agent binds to the extracellular portion of NKG2A with a KD at least 100-fold lower than to NKG 2C. In another preferred aspect, the agent binds to the extracellular portion of NKG2A with a KD that is at least 150, 200, 300, 400, or 10,000 fold lower than to NKG 2C. In another aspect of the invention, the agent binds to the extracellular portion of NKG2A with a KD at least 100-fold lower than to the NKG2C, NKG E and/or NKG2H molecules. In another preferred aspect, the agent binds to the extracellular portion of NKG2A with a KD that is at least 150, 200, 300, 400, or 10,000 fold lower than the NKG2C, NKG C and/or NKG2H molecules. This can be measured, for example, in a BiaCore experiment, in which the ability of the agent to bind to the extracellular portion of immobilized CD94/NKG2A (e.g., purified from CD94/NKG2 expressing cells or produced in a biological system) is measured and compared to the binding of the agent to similarly produced CD94/NKG2C and/or other CD94/NKG2 variants in the same assay. Alternatively, binding of the agent to cells naturally expressing or overexpressing (e.g., after transient transfection or stable transfection) CD94/NKG2A may be measured and compared to binding to cells expressing CD94/NKG2C and/or other CD94/NKG2 variants. The anti-NKG 2A antibody may optionally bind NKG2B, which is a NKG2A splice variant that forms an inhibitory receptor with CD 94. In one embodiment, affinity may be measured using the method disclosed in U.S. patent No. 8,206,709, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, for example, by Biacore assessment of binding to a covalently immobilized NKG2A-CD94-Fc fusion protein as shown in example 8 of U.S. patent No. 8,206,709. </p>The anti-NKG 2A antibody may be a humanized antibody, e.g., a VH human acceptor framework comprising an acceptor sequence from a human acceptor selected from, e.g., VH1_18, VH5_a, VH5_51, VH1_f, and VH1_46, and JH 6J-segments, or other human germline VH framework sequences known in the art.
