    "r weight of the \n\n soluble chelating composition molecules by passage through a successive series of ultrafiltration membranes each of different molecular weight exclusion sizes and with an additional one liter of water being used at each filtration stage to wash through the majority of molecules that would pass through each of the specific ultrafilter sizes and with nitrogen gas pressure to assist the filtration.. The following separate fractions were obtained representing materials of the following molecular weight size ranges: &gt;100kDa; lOkDa-lOOkDa and lkDa-lOkDa (kDa = 1000 Da).Each of these separate fractions were harvested and freeze dried to yield dry samples for testing. </p>The relative percentage weight yields of each size fraction were determined as a function of the combined weight of the three size fractions as shown in the table below: </p></p>These yield results demonstrated the majority of the soluble chelating composition for this example preparation was of a molecular size greater than lkDa and up to lOOkDa with little of this particular sample being greater than lOOkDa. The absorption spectra of each of the above size fractions, as well as the sample as prepared by direct dialysis , i.e. &gt;8kDa size soluble chelator, and also a reference sample of MAHMP, i.e., the chelating monomer precursor as prepared in Example 3, were compared after their reactions with iron as described for Example 22. These results are shown in the graphs of Figure 11 (where kDa=kD). The absorption spectra in the graphs of Figure 11 demonstrate a generally similar chemical composition of these various molecular size fractions, i.e., as to relative amounts of their contents of the iron-binding chelating group within the co-polymers. The chelating monomer group MAHMP alone and this group when within the soluble chelating composition exhibited a chromophore when iron was bound to it, with an absorption maximum at around 460 nm. \n\n Results of testing as to the relative anti-microbial inhibitory activities of these various fractions with each tested at a concentration of 0.25 mg/ml against the yeast Candia albicans and with testing similar to that described in Example 22 are shown in the graphs of Figure 12. The &gt;100kDa fraction represented insufficient recovered material for this anti-microbial testing and therefore this was not tested. These results show similar activities of the soluble chelating composition when in a size of &gt;lkDa and up to a size of lOOkDa. All three molecular size fractions of the soluble chelating composition provided strong anti-microbial activity with less than 5 % of control growth occurring even after an incubation period of 14 days. The MAHMP of a molecular size of &lt;500Da and being the precursor monomer to the soluble chelating compositions was found to readily support growth of this yeast as had also been shown with the results of Example 21. </p>This example therefore demonstrates that low molecular weight soluble c",
    "edominance of the actual filtered soluble chelator fraction as obtained with this filter was of molecular weight size substantially greater than 1500Da, i.e., a normal distribution of polymer molecular sizes with average molecular weight well above 1500Da would be expected. MAHMP has a molecular weight of approximately 236Da and vinylpyrrolidone has a molecular weight of approximately 1 1 IDa. A soluble chelating composition as made from these two monomer groups would have a molecular weight above 1500Da with a copolymer of both monomers or a homopolymer of the MAHMP monomer comprised of only </p>approximately 4 monomer units of each material. \n\n Example 24. Demonstration of the anti-microbial activity of Iodine as combined with the Fe chelating activity of a soluble chelating composition containing pyrrolidone and/or polypyrrolidone in its chemical structure. </p>Candida albicans ATCC 10231, yeast cells, as grown in defined medium as for Example 18 with no additional added iron (i.e., the only but adequate Fe available for the yeast was contributed from being present along with the other added medium components) were inoculated into fresh media with added iron at either 0.5 \u03bc\u039c or 5.0 \u03bc\u039c and tested for their sensitivities to the soluble chelating composition as from Example 4 and with this chelating composition further treated with iodine as follows: A sample of the soluble chelating composition prepared as in Example 4 was dissolved in water at 20 mg/ml and iodine solution (KI in water) was added to achieve a potential loading of 10% (w/w) iodine onto the composition. After addition of the iodine, the solution of soluble chelator/iodine was dialyzed (8,000 MW cut-off dialysis tubing) for 12 hours against deionized water and then the dialyzed composition was harvested and its anti-microbial activity was compared to a sample of the soluble chelating composition that had not been treated with iodine. Dialysis was performed for this example to ensure the substantial portion of the iodine available was not free iodine in solution but rather was residual iodine bound to aspects of the soluble chelating composition. Samples were compared for their anti-microbial activity with yeasts grown in low added Fe (Graph A in Figure 13) and high added Fe (Graph B in Figure 13). </p>The results in graphs A and B of Figure 13 show that under low Fe conditions both the soluble chelator and the soluble chelator with bound iodine were anti-microbial in comparison to the untreated control (no added chelating composition). With high added Fe, i.e., sufficient added Fe to overcome the Fe chelating anti-microbial activity of the soluble chelating composition, the soluble chelating composition without added iodine was less active due to the presence of excess Fe but the soluble chelating composition containing iodine still retained its anti-microbial activity. This comparison demonstrates the separate anti-microbial activity of iodine as bound to the soluble chelating com"
