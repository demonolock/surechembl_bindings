The reaction mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred overnight. The solvent was evaporated and the residue was partitioned between ethyl acetate and water. The organic layer was separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. After concentration, the crude title product (160 g, crude) was obtained as a colorless oil, which was used in the next step without further purification.</p>Step 5:2- (4-Benzylpiperazin-2-yl) acetic acid methyl ester</p></p>Will N <sup>1</sup> -benzyl-N <sup>2</sup> Tribenzyl ethane-1, 2-diamine (153 g) was combined with MeCN (770 mL) and K was added as a solid with vigorous stirring <sub>2</sub> CO <sub>3</sub> (87.8 g,636 mmol) and KI (1.86 g,11.2 mmol). Finally, (E) -methyl 4-bromobut-2-enoate (66.8 g,373 mmol) was added and the suspension stirred at room temperature overnight. The mixture was filtered and the filter cake was rinsed with MeCN (140 mL) and then DCM (240 mL). The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in MeOH (240 mL) and a solution of HCl in dioxane (4 m,100 mL) was added. The resulting solution was heated under reflux for 1.5 hours, then cooled to room temperature and concentrated under vacuum. The residue was diluted with water (600 mL) and made acidic (pH about 3) by the addition of 10% HCl. The mixture was washed with EA (2 x 300 ml) and K was added by careful addition of solid  <sub>2</sub> CO <sub>3</sub> Then, 25% aqueous NaOH (24 mL) was added to make the aqueous phase basic (pH about 9). The mixture was extracted with DCM (3\u00d7260 ml) and the combined organic phases were washed with brine, over Na <sub>2</sub> SO <sub>4</sub> Dried and concentrated in vacuo to give DP as a pale yellow oil (33 g, yield: 34%, used in both steps).</p>LC-MS rt=0.35 min; MS calculated: 248.2, MS (ESI): 249.1[ M+H ]] <sup>+</sup> \u3002</p>Step 5: 4-benzyl-2- (2-methoxy-2-oxoethyl) piperazine-1-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester</p></p>Di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (29 g,133 mmol) was added to a stirred mixture of methyl 2- (4-benzylpiperazin-2-yl) acetate (33 g,133 mol) in DCM (300 mL) at 0deg.C.
