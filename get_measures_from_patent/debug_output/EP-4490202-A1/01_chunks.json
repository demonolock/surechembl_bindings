    "27 \u00b0C and then harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole buffer (pH 7.5) and cells were lysed by sonication. The cell lysate was loaded on a Ni-NTA affinity column and proteins were eluted with 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole buffer (pH 7.5). Fractions were combined and concentrated followed by buffer exchange with phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.4. The identity of the isolated proteins was confirmed using MALDI-TOF MS. Purity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. [00252] 6.5 Example 5: Design and generation of a streptavidin-binding cyclopeptibody. [00253] This example demonstrates the creation of a functional cyclopeptibody capable of binding the protein streptavidin. [00254] To prepare a cyclopeptibody capable of binding the protein streptavidin, a cyclic streptavidin-binding peptide previously discovered via phage display (Owens et al, ACS Cent Sci. (2020); 6(3):368-381) was genetically fused to the Fc domain of human IgG1 via a spacer (Entry 1, Table 1). The resulting cyclopeptibody (called Strep-m3-Tras-Fc) was expressed, purified, and characterized as described in Example 4. This construct was confirmed to contain the cyclic peptide constrained via O2beY/Cys thioether (i/i-8) linkage, where \u2018i\u2019 indicates the position of the non-canonical amino acid O2beY (also refereed to herein as p-2beF). The cyclopeptibody Strep-m3-Tras-Fc was then characterized for its streptavidin binding affinity using a reported in vitro binding assay (Owens et al, ACS Cent Sci. (2020); 6(3):368-381). These experiments showed that cyclopeptibody Strep-m3-Tras-Fc is able to bind streptavidin \n\nwith high affinity (KD = 37 nM), while the Fc domain alone shows no binding (Fig. 11). In addition, the cyclopeptibody Strep-m3-Tras-Fc showed improved (1.3-fold) affinity toward the target protein compared to the same cyclic peptide fused to CBD (KD = 50 nM). [00255] Experimental Details. [00256] Streptavidin Binding Assay. For the streptavidin binding assays, streptavidin-coated plates (Sigma-Aldrich) were used. For the Keap1, Shh and PD-L1 binding assay, target protein was immobilized on microtiter plates by incubating 100 \u00b5L of a 4 \u00b5M protein solution in PBS buffer overnight at 4\u00b0C, followed by decanting the protein solution and blocking with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. After washing (3 \u00d7 150 \u00b5L of PBS with 0.05% Tween-20), each well was incubated with 100 \u00b5L of purified FLAG-tagged cyclopeptibody at varying concentrations for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing three times with wash buffer, each well was incubated with 100 \u00b5L of 1:2500 dilution of HRP- conjugate mouse anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing three times with wash buffer, 100 \u00b5L of 2.2 mM o- phenylenediamine dihydrochloride, 4.2 mM urea hydrogen peroxide, 100 mM dibasic sodium phosphate, and 50 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.0, were added to each well, followed by measurement of the absorbance at 450 nm after 10\u201320 min using a Tecan Infinite 1000 plate reader. Equilibrium dissociation constants (K<sub>D</sub>) were determined by fitting the dose\u2013response curves to a 1:1 binding isotherm equation via nonlinear regression. using SigmaPlot. Mean values and standard deviations were calculated from experiments performed in triplicate. [00257] 6.6 Example 6: Design and generation of a Keap1-binding cyclopeptibody. [00258] This example demonstrates the creation of a functional cyclopeptibody capable of binding the target protein Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). Keap1 is implicated in sequestration and ubiquitination of Nrf2, a transcriptional regulator that promotes the expression of genes that exert a cytoprotective function in response to oxidative stress and reactive (electrophilic) chemicals in human cells. [00259] To prepare a cyclopeptibody capable of binding the target protein Keap1, a cyclic Keap1-binding peptide previously discovered via phage display (Owens et al, ACS Cent Sci. (2020); 6(3):368-381) was genetically fused to the Fc domain of human IgG1 via a spacer (Entry 3, Table 1). The resulting cyclopeptibody (called KKD-m1-Tras-Fc) was expressed, purified, and characterized as described in Example 4. This construct was confirmed to contain the cyclic peptide constrained via O2beY/Cys thioether (i/i+7) linkage, where \u2018i\u2019 indicates the position of the non-canonical amino acid O2beY (also refereed to herein as p-2beF). The cyclopeptibody \n\nKKD-m1-Tras-Fc was then characterized for Keap1 binding affinity using a reported in vitro binding assay (Owens et al, ACS Cent Sci. (2020); 6(3):368-381). These experiments showed that cyclopeptibody KKD-m1-Tras-Fc is able to bind Keap1 with very high affinity (KD = 4 nM), while the Fc domain alone shows no significant binding below 100-200 nM (Fig. 12). Importantly, the cyclopeptibody KKD-m1-Tras-Fc showed significantly improved (&gt;20-fold) affinity toward the target protein compared to the same cyclic peptide fused to CBD (KD = 85 nM). The large increase in target binding affinity can be attributed, at least in part, to avidity effect due to the bivalency of the cyclopeptibody compared to the cyclic peptide alone. As such, these results demonstrate the functionality and advantageous properties of the cyclopeptibody molecules of the invention. [00260] Experimental Details. [00261] Keap1 Binding Assay. For the Keap1 binding assay, Keap1 was immobilized on microtiter plates by incubating 100 \u00b5L of a 4 \u00b5M protein solution in PBS buffer overnight at 4\u00b0C, followed by washing (3 \u00d7 150 \u00b5L of PBS with 0.5% Tween-20) and blocking with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1.5 h at room temperature. After washing, each well was incubated with 100 \u00b5L of purified FLAG-tagged peptide at varying concentrations for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing three times with wash buffer, each well was incubated with 100 \u00b5L of 1:2500 dilution of HRP-conjugate mouse anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody (Sigma- Aldrich) for 1 hour at room temperature. After three washing steps with wash buffer, 100 \u00b5L of 2.2 mM o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride, 4.2 mM urea hydrogen peroxide, 100 mM dibasic sodium phosphate, and 50 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.0, were added to each well, followed by measurement of the absorbance at 450 nm after 10\u201320 min using a Tecan Infinite 1000 plate reader. Equilibrium dissociation constants (K<sub>D</sub>) were determined by fitting the dose\u2013response curves to a 1:1 binding isotherm equation via nonlinear regression using SigmaPlot. Mean values and standard deviations were calculated from experiments performed in triplicate. [00262] 6.7 Example 7: Design and generation of a Hedgehog-binding cyclopeptibody. [00263] This example demonstrates the creation of a functional cyclopeptibody capable of binding the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling protein. This example further demonstrates that said cyclopeptibody is capable of binding other analogs of Hedgehog protein, namely Indian (Ihh) and Desert Hedgehog (Dhh). Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) is a key signaling protein implicated in the activation of the Hedgehog pathway. The Hedgehog pathway plays a critical role in controlling embryonic development, and abnormal activation of this pathway has been implicated in various human malignancies, including leukemia and tumors of the prostate, \n\npancreas, and colon (Rubin et al, Nat. Rev. Drug Discovery 2006, 5, 1026\u22121033; Theunissen et al. Cancer Res.2009, 69, 6007\u22126010). [00264] To prepare a Hedgehog-targeting cyclopeptibody, a Shh-binding cyclic peptide previously developed via affinity maturation of a HHIP loop 2 mimic (Owens AE et al., 2017, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 139:12559-12568) was genetically fused to the Fc domain of human IgG1 via a spacer (Entry 5, Table 1). The resulting cyclopeptibody (called L2-m5-Tras-Fc) was expressed, purified, and characterized as described in Example 4. This construct was confirmed to contain the cyclic peptide constrained via O2beY/Cys thioether (i/i+6) linkage, where \u2018i\u2019 indicates the position of the non-canonical amino acid O2beY (also referred to herein as p- 2beF). The cyclopeptibody L2-m5-Tras-Fc was then characterized for Shh binding affinity using a reported in vitro binding assay (Owens AE et al., 2017, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 139:12559-12568). These experiments showed that cyclopeptibody L2-m5-Tras-Fc is able to bind Shh with very high affinity (K<sub>D</sub> = 7 nM), while the Fc domain alone shows no significant binding below 500 nM (Fig. 13A). Importantly, the cyclopeptibody L2-m5-Tras-Fc showed significantly improved (&gt;55-fold) affinity toward the target protein compared to the same cyclic peptide fused to CBD (KD = 388 nM). The large increase in target binding affinity can be attributed, at least in part, to avidity effect due to the bivalency of the cyclopeptibody compared to the cyclic peptide alone. As such, these results further demonstrated the functionality and advantageous properties of the cyclopeptibody molecules of the invention. [00265] The cyclopeptibody L2-m5-Tras-Fc was also tested for its ability to bind other analogs of Hedgehog, namely Desert (Dhh) and Indian (Ihh) Hedgehog, which is desirable for certain therapeutic applications. Indeed, in certain cancers like leukemia aberrant ligand- mediated Hedgehog signaling is mediated by different analogs of Hedgehog. Importantly, these experiments showed that L2-m5-Tras-Fc is capable of binding all analogs of Hedgehog with equally high affinity (K<sub>D</sub> : 8-10 nM; Fig. 13B). In comparison, the L2-m5 peptide was previously reported to bind Ihh and Dhh with much lower affinity (KD: 250-350 nM, Owens AE et al., 2017, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 139:12559-12568). [00266] 6.8 Example 8: Design and generation of cyclopeptibodies targeting PD-L1 and the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. [00267] This example demonstrates the creation of functional cyclopeptibodies capable of binding to PD-L1, a well-established therapeutic target in cancer immunotherapy as described above. This example further demonstrates that said cyclopeptibodies are capable of disrupting \n\nthe interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1, a key target for blockage of the PD-L1/PD-1 axis in cancer. [00268] To prepare PD-L1-targeting cyclopeptibody, a series of cyclic peptides cyclized via a cysteine-reactive non-canonical amino acid according to the methods of the invention, were initially designed and tested for their ability to bind PD-L1. Accordingly, three linear peptide sequences known to bind PD-L1, namely RK10 (Caldwell et al., Sci. Rep., 2017, 7, 13682), CLP002 and CLP003 (Liu et al., Immunother. Cancer., 2019, 7, 270), were cyclized using either pCmF or pCaaF located at different position and arrangements (i.e., ncAA/Cys or Cys/ncAA) of these sequences (FIG. 14). The corresponding cyclic peptides as fusions to a CBD affinity tag were recombinantly expressed in E. coli and purified. The CBD tag was enzymatically cleaved and the resulting cyclic peptides were purified by HPLC. The linear peptide counterparts were also produced for comparison purposes. The cyclic and linear peptides were then characterized for their binding affinities to PD-L1 using an in vitro binding assay. These experiments show that the linear peptide RK10 bound to PD-L1 with a KD of 80 \u00b5M, CLP003 with a KD of 378 \u00b5M, whereas the CLP002 showed no detectable binding up to 200 \u00b5M. Importantly, the cyclic RK10-based peptide cyclized using pCaaF (called cRK10) showed significantly higher affinity toward the target protein PD-L1 (K<sub>D</sub> = 13 \u00b5M vs. 80 \u00b5M) compared to both the linear peptide RK10 and the pCmF-cyclized sequence. On the other hand, both cyclic CLP003-based peptides constrained via pCaaF/Cys or pCmF/Cys linkage show a K<sub>D</sub> of ~10 \u00b5M for binding to PD-L1, corresponding to a ~40-fold higher affinity compared to the linear CLP003 peptide. Interestingly, in contrast to the inactive CLP002 linear peptide, both the cyclic CLP002-based peptides show PD-L1 binding activity, with KD in the low micromolar range (Fig 14). [00269] Based on these results, two cyclopeptibodies containing either the pCaaF-cyclized RK10 sequence (called cRK10-Tras-Fc) or the pCaaF-cyclized CLP003 sequence (called cCLP003-Tras-Fc) were prepared, expressed and isolated as described in Example 4. Upon testing in the in vitro PD-L1 binding assay, cyclopeptibody cRK10-Tras-Fc was determined to bind PD-L1 with a K<sub>D</sub> of 40 nM, which corresponds to a 300-fold higher binding affinity compared to the cyclic peptide cRK10 (Fig 15A). Similarly, the cyclopeptibody cCLP003-Tras- Fc showed submicromolar affinity for PD-L1 with a K<sub>D</sub> of ~250 nM, this corresponding to a 40- fold increase compared to the cyclic peptide alone (Fig 15B). [00270] Next, we examined the ability of the cyclopeptibody cCLP003-Tras-Fc to inhibit the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction using a competition assay with recombinant biotinylated PD-1 (Bio- PD-1). Briefly, PD-L1 immobilized on a plate was incubated with Bio-PD-1 and varying \n\nconcentrations of cCLP003-Tras-Fc or control Fc. The PD-L1-bound PD-1 was then quantified colorimetrically (OD450) using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin. In this assay, cCLP003-Tras-Fc was showed inhibition of PD-1/PD-L1 interaction at low micromolar range (IC50 = 6 \u00b5M), whereas Fc domain alone did not exhibit significant inhibitory activity (Fig 16). Altogether, these results further demonstrate various embodiments of the invention, such as its use for developing functional cyclopeptibodies capable of binding a target protein of interest, the advantageous features of the cyclopeptibody molecules over the cyclic peptides alone, and their utility as potent agents against a therapeutically relevant protein and protein-protein interaction. [00271] Experimental Details. [00272] Cloning, Expression and Purification of PD-L1 and Biotinylated PD-1. Genes encoding for PD-L (Genscript) and PD-1 (gift from Tudor Fulga) were subcloned into pET22b (Novagen) respectively, resulting in fusion of poly-histidine sequence to the C-terminus of PD- L1 and PD-1. A synthetic oligonucleotide (Integrated DNA Technologies) was used for the PCR amplification of an Avi tag fused to N-terminal of PD-1. A Cys to Ser mutation was introduced at position 93 of PD-1 to aid expression and folding. PD-L1 and biotinylated PD-1 were expressed in E.coli BL21(DE3) as inclusion bodies. For PD-L1, the cells were grown at 37 <sup>o</sup>C in LB medium with ampicillin (50 mg/L) until OD600 reached 0.6\u20131.0, and the protein expression was induced with IPTG (1 mM) and incubated for 4 h at 37 <sup>o</sup>C. For biotinylated PD-1, the plasmid encoding Avi-PD-1 and the pLEMO-BirA plasmid (a gift from Alexander Gabibov) were co-transformed into BL21(DE3). The cells were grown ",
    "the RGD motifs. Because of their role in regulating cell migration, growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, integrin receptors are over-expressed on cell surface of several types of human cancers. Accordingly, compounds directed against integrin receptors have been investigated for the therapeutic value for the treatment of cancer as well as other diseases such as thrombosis and osteoporosis. [00282] To generate an integrin-targeting cyclopeptibody, we started by identifying a genetically encodable cyclic peptide that is capable of binding to an integrin receptor, using the cancer-related integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 as the target. Accordingly, we designed a panel of cyclic peptides whose sequence incorporate an RGD motif and which are cyclized through a O2beY/Cys, pCaaF/Cys, or pCmF/Cys pair via different connectivity (i.e., ncAA/Cys and Cys/ncAA) (Table 2 (SEQ ID Nos: 241-258) and FIG.18A). This choice was motivated by knowledge of the effect of the type of ncAA and orientation of the ncAA/Cys on modulating the functional properties of these thioether-constrained peptides, as determined in our prior studies (Iannuzzelli &amp; Fasan, Chem. Sci., 2020, 11, 6202). The cyclic peptides were produced recombinantly with a N- terminal FLAG tag and C-terminal chitin-binding domain (CBD) tag, proteolytically cleaved from the CBD tag, and purified using established methods using similar procedures as described in Example 8. The purified RGD-containing cyclic peptides were then tested in an in vitro binding assay with immobilized integrin \u03b1v\u03b23, follow by detection of the bound peptide with an HRP-conjugated anti-FLAG antibody. Many of these peptides showed detectable activity for \u03b1v\u03b23 binding with estimated affinities in the low micromolar range (KD: 10-50 \u00b5M). [00283] Based on these results, two cyclopeptides were genetically fused to the Fc domain of human IgG1 to give constructs RGD5R(pCaaF)-Tras-Fc and RGD5R(pCmF)-Tras-Fc (Table 1, Entries 15-16). After purification as described in Example 2, these cyclopeptibodies were used \n\nto treat breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231), which are known to express high levels of integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 on their surface. The cyclopeptibody treated cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry using a procedure similar to that described for the PD-L1-targeting cyclopeptibodies in Example 9. Importantly, these experiments demonstrated the ability and functionality of both cyclopeptibody to label the cells (Fig. 18B), whereas the Fc domain alone and the secondary anti-IgG1-Fc antibody show minimal or significantly reduced staining. [00284] Overall, these results demonstrate the utility of the methods disclosed herein for the successful generation of functional integrin-targeting cyclopeptibodies. As shown here, these compounds can be applied for biomarker detection and imaging in cancer cells. As for the cyclopeptibody molecules described in the previous Examples, several other applications for these compounds can be easily envisioned, including detection and/or staining of the target protein in vitro and in vivo (e.g., upon conjugation of the cyclopeptibody with a fluorescent dye, IR probe, or PET contrast agent), cell-targeted drug delivery (e.g., upon conjugation of the cyclopeptibody with a drug cargo), and use as therapeutic agents. [00285] 6.11 Example 11: Stability of cyclopeptibodies in human blood serum. [00286] The proteolytic stability of cyclopeptibodies cCLP003-Tras-Fc and L2-m5-Tras-Fc were assessed by incubating these proteins in human blood serum, followed by measurement of the cyclopeptibody activity using an in vitro binding assay with plate-immobilized PD-L1 or Sh as described in Example 7 and 8, respectively. These experiments showed that the half-life of cCLP003-Tras-Fc in human blood serum is longer than 24 hrs. (Fig 19A), while no loss in activity was observed for L2-m5-Tras-Fc over 24 h (Fig 19B), indicating a half-life &gt;30-50 hours. These results show that cyclopeptibodies show significant stability in human blood serum, which is desirable for the application of these compounds in in vivo studies and for therapeutic purposes. [00287] Experimental Details. Serum stability Assay. The human male serum (Sigma-Aldrich) was clarified by centrifugation at 14000 rpm for 15 min.50% serum was prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), then incubated at 37 <sup>o</sup>C. Cyclopeptiodies were dissolved in 30 \u00b5L of 50% serum at a final concentration of 1 \u00b5M, incubated at 37 <sup>o</sup>C. Serum samples with diluted cyclopeptibodies were prepared in the same way described above over a time course of 30 h for cCLP003-Tras-Fc-His and 24 h for L2-m5-Tras-Fc-His, followed by incubated at 37 <sup>o</sup>C. Intact cyclopeptibodies in serum were quantified using the binding assay described above. In the assay, immobilized PD- \n\nL1 or Shh was incubated with 100 \u00b5L of serum samples diluted with PBS (1: 10 dilution for cCLP003-Tras-Fc-His, 1:100 dilution for L2-m5-Tras-Fc-His). Intact cyclopeptibody in each sample was detected with HRP-conjugate mouse anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody. The absolute concentration of intact cyclopeptibody in each serum sample was quantified using a calibration curve, which was generated from a binding assay in which immobilized PD-L1 or Shh was incubated with cyclopeptibody in serial dilution (0-100 nM for cCLP003-Tras-Fc-His; 0-10 nM for L2-m5-Tras-Fc-His), followed by detected with HRP-conjugate mouse anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody, absorbance at 450 nm was measured as a function of cyclopeptibody concentration. [00288] 6.14 Example 12: Application of cyclopeptibodies as imaging agents. [00289] Cyclopeptibodies can be applied for detection and imaging of a target protein in cells and other biological systems. To illustrate this aspect of the invention, breast cancer cells MDA- MB-231 cells were treated with PD-L1 targeting cRK10(pCaaF)-Tras-Fc. MDA-MB-231 cells are known to express high levels of PD-L1 on the cell membrane. After treatment with cRK10(pCaaF)-Tras-Fc, the cyclopeptibody bound to the surface PD-L1 was labeled with fluorescein-conjugated anti-human Fc antibody (\u2018anti-Fc-FITC\u2019) and cells were imaged using confocal microscopy. These experiments showed that cRK10(pCaaF)-Tras-Fc is able to efficiently recognize PD-L1 expressed on the surface of MDA-MB-231 cells, as determined by fluorescent imaging of the cells after treatment with the cyclopeptibody followed by staining with a fluorescein-conjugated anti-Fc antibody (\u2018anti-Fc-FITC\u2019) (Figure 17C). No background labeling was observed in control experiments in the absence of cyclopeptibodies. Overall, these experiments demonstrated the functionality of two PD-L1-targeting cyclopeptibodies for specific detection and labeling of PD-L1 expressed on cancer cells, supporting their potential value for biomarker detection and tumor imaging purposes. [00290] 6.12 Example 13: Cyclopeptibody molecule with variable spacer sequences. [00291] Spacer sequences can be introduced at various positions of the cyclopeptibody molecule to modulate its stability and/or protein binding properties. For example, variable spacer sequences can be introduced between the cyclic peptide and the Fc domain, or fragment thereof, in the cyclopeptibody molecule for the purpose of improving stability of the construct and/or enhance affinity toward the target protein. [00292] To illustrate this aspect of the invention, a series of PD-L1 targeting cyclopeptibodies were prepared by introducing variable spacer sequences between the cyclic peptide and Fc domain in the PD-L1-targeting cyclopeptibody cRK10-Tras-Fc (Table 1, Entries 31-34; FIG. \n\n20). The spacer sequences included a more flexible (\u2013GSGSGS\u2013), more rigid (\u2013PAPAP\u2013; \u2013 EAAAK\u2013) or longer linker (Q12) compared to the exa-glutamine (Q6) spacer sequence in cyclopeptibody cRK10-Tras-Fc. After expression in E. coli and purification via Ni-affinity chromatography, these cyclopeptibodies were determined to bind to PD-L1 with high binding affinity (KD = 90-240 nM; FIG.20). Whereas the cyclopeptibodies with the shorter spacers were found to exhibit similar PD-L1 binding affinity (KD = 88-90 nM), the more rigid spacers (\u2013 PAPAP\u2013; \u2013EAAAK\u2013) show improved proteolytic stability compared to the more flexible spacer (\u2013GSGSGS\u2013). On the other hand, cyclopeptibody cRK10-Tras-Fc shows a six-fold higher PD- L1 binding affinity (KD = 42 vs. 237 nM; Figures 15 and 20) compared to cyclopeptibody FLAG-cRK10-Q12-Tras-Fc-His, which contains the same cyclic peptide and Fc domain but separated by a longer polyglutamine spacer (Q<sub>12</sub> vs. Q<sub>6</sub>). This example demonstrates the possibility of utilizing different spacer sequences within cyclopeptibody sequence for modulating its stability and/or protein binding properties. [00293] 6.13 Example 14: Polyvalent cyclopeptibodies. [00294] Unlike antibodies, cyclopeptibodies can be designed to easily incorporate multiple copies of the same protein-binding cyclic peptide to the same chain of an immunoglobulin Fc domain. Upon spontaneous homodimerization of the immunoglobulin Fc domain, a cyclopeptibody containing multiple copies (i.e., &gt;2) of the same protein-binding cyclic peptide is obtained. This polyvalency can results in enhanced affinity and/or specificity toward the protein targeted by the cyclic peptides, compared to a cyclopeptibody containing a single copy of the cyclic peptide, due to avidity effects. [00295] To illustrate this aspect of the invention, a polyvalent streptavidin-targeting cyclopeptibody was prepared by fusing two copies of the O2beY-linked Strep-m3 cyclic peptide to the N-terminus of human IgG1 Fc containing a C-terminal poly-His tag (Table 1, Entry 35). The resulting cyclopeptibody (called \u2018FLAG-Strep-m3-Strep-m3-Tras-Fc-His\u2019) was expressed, purified, and characterized as described in Example 4. The cyclopeptibody FLAG-Strep-m3- Strep-m3-Tras-Fc-His was then characterized for its streptavidin binding affinity using a reported in vitro binding assay (Owens et al, ACS Cent Sci. (2020); 6(3):368-381). These experiments showed that cyclopeptibody FLAG-Strep-m3-Strep-m3-Tras-Fc-His is able to bind streptavidin with high affinity (KD = 56 nM) (Fig.21). [00296] As another example, a polyvalent Keap1-targeting cyclopeptibody was prepared by fusing two copies of the O2beY-linked KKD-m1 cyclic peptide to the N-terminus of human IgG<sub>1</sub> Fc containing a C-terminal poly-His tag (Table 1, Entry 36). The resulting cyclopeptibody \n\n(called \u2018FLAG-KKD-m1-KKD-m1-Tras-Fc-His\u2019) was expressed, purified, and characterized as described in Example 4. The cyclopeptibody FLAG-KKD-m1-KKD-m1-Tras-Fc-His was then characterized for Keap1 binding affinity using a reported in vitro binding assay (Owens et al, ACS Cent Sci. (2020); 6(3):368-381). These experiments showed that cyclopeptibody FLAG- KKD-m1-KKD-m1-Tras-Fc-His is able to bind Keap1 with very high affinity (KD = 45 nM) (FIG.21). [00297] 6.14 Example 15: Bispecific cyclopeptibodies. [00298] As described above, bispecific cyclopeptibodies can be prepared by fusing cyclic peptides with different target specificity to the same or different immunoglobulin Fc domain molecule. In some embodiments, bispecific cyclopeptibodies can be prepared by combining two chains of an immunoglobulin Fc domain molecule, each incorporating a cyclic peptide with different specificity toward a target protein of interest. This specific application benefits from the use of engineered chains of an immunoglobulin Fc domain molecule which contain mutations that favor heterodimerization of the Fc domain chains over homodimerization, e.g., through a so-called knob-into-hole strategy (Ma et al., Frontier Immunology (2021); 12:626616). [00299] To illustrate this aspect of the invention, a bispecific streptavidin/PD-L1 targeting cyclopeptibody was prepared by fusing a PD-L1-targeting cyclic peptide (cRK10) cyclized via pCaaF to the N-terminus of human IgG<sub>1</sub> Fc domain containing the mutations Y349C/T366S/L368A/Y407V to form a \u2018hole\u2019 Fc chain. A second Fc-fusion construct was prepared by fusing a streptavidin-binding cyclic peptide (Strep-m3) cyclized by pCaaF to the N- terminus of human IgG1 Fc domain containing the mutations S354C/T366W to form a \u2018knob\u2019 Fc chain. This construct was also designed to contain a poly-His tag to facilitate purification of the desired bispecific cyclopeptibody (Table 1, Entrie"
