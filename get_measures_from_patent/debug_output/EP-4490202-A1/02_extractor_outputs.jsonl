These experiments showed that cyclopeptibody Strep-m3-Tras-Fc is able to bind streptavidin with high affinity (KD = 37 nM), while the Fc domain alone shows no binding (Fig. 11).\n2. In addition, the cyclopeptibody Strep-m3-Tras-Fc showed improved (1.3-fold) affinity toward the target protein compared to the same cyclic peptide fused to CBD (KD = 50 nM).\n3. These experiments showed that cyclopeptibody KKD-m1-Tras-Fc is able to bind Keap1 with very high affinity (KD = 4 nM), while the Fc domain alone shows no significant binding below 100-200 nM (Fig. 12).\n4. Importantly, the cyclopeptibody KKD-m1-Tras-Fc showed significantly improved (>20-fold) affinity toward the target protein compared to the same cyclic peptide fused to CBD (KD = 85 nM).\n5. These experiments showed that cyclopeptibody L2-m5-Tras-Fc is able to bind Shh with very high affinity (K<sub>D</sub> = 7 nM), while the Fc domain alone shows no significant binding below 500 nM (Fig. 13A).\n6. Importantly, the cyclopeptibody L2-m5-Tras-Fc showed significantly improved (>55-fold) affinity toward the target protein compared to the same cyclic peptide fused to CBD (KD = 388 nM).\n7. Indeed, in certain cancers like leukemia aberrant ligand- mediated Hedgehog signaling is mediated by different analogs of Hedgehog. Importantly, these experiments showed that L2-m5-Tras-Fc is capable of binding all analogs of Hedgehog with equally high affinity (K<sub>D</sub> : 8-10 nM; Fig. 13B).\n8. The linear peptide RK10 bound to PD-L1 with a KD of 80 \u00b5M, CLP003 with a KD of 378 \u00b5M, whereas the CLP002 showed no detectable binding up to 200 \u00b5M.\n9. Importantly, the cyclic RK10-based peptide cyclized using pCaaF (called cRK10) showed significantly higher affinity toward the target protein PD-L1 (K<sub>D</sub> = 13 \u00b5M vs. 80 \u00b5M) compared to both the linear peptide RK10 and the pCmF-cyclized sequence.\n10. On the other hand, both cyclic CLP003-based peptides constrained via pCaaF/Cys or pCmF/Cys linkage show a K<sub>D</sub> of ~10 \u00b5M for binding to PD-L1, corresponding to a ~40-fold higher affinity compared to the linear CLP003 peptide.\n11. Upon testing in the in vitro PD-L1 binding assay, cyclopeptibody cRK10-Tras-Fc was determined to bind PD-L1 with a K<sub>D</sub> of 40 nM, which corresponds to a 300-fold higher binding affinity compared to the cyclic peptide cRK10 (Fig 15A).\n12. Similarly, the cyclopeptibody cCLP003-Tras-Fc showed submicromolar affinity for PD-L1 with a K<sub>D</sub> of ~250 nM, this corresponding to a 40- fold increase compared to the cyclic peptide alone (Fig 15B).\n13. In this assay, cCLP003-Tras-Fc was showed inhibition of PD-1/PD-L1 interaction at low micromolar range (IC50 = 6 \u00b5M), whereas Fc domain alone did not exhibit significant inhibitory activity (Fig 16)."}

The absolute concentration of intact cyclopeptibody in each serum sample was quantified using a calibration curve, which was generated from a binding assay in which immobilized PD-L1 or Shh was incubated with cyclopeptibody in serial dilution (0-100 nM for cCLP003-Tras-Fc-His; 0-10 nM for L2-m5-Tras-Fc-His), followed by detected with HRP-conjugate mouse anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody, absorbance at 450 nm was measured as a function of cyclopeptibody concentration.\n3.
