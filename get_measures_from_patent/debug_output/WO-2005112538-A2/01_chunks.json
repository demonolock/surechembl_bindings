    "ts were performed until stabilization in 2 g, always with renewal of Krebs solution. Then, vasoconstrictions were induced by 60 mM KCI solution, in each ring, to verify the viability of the organ on the day of the experiment. The preparation was submitted to contraction with phenylephrine (5 x 10<sup>\"5</sup> M) and, then the rings were washed to reach the basal line (0% of vasoconstriction). The procedure was repeated until obtainment of a constant curve. Then, a curve, using increasing concentrations of phenylephrine (5x10<sup>\"9</sup> - 5x10<sup>\"</sup> M), was performed for each ring, as a positive control. The segments were washed to reach the basal line (0% of vasoconstriction) and incubated with the test compounds, individually, for 30 minutes. A second phenylephrine curve was performed and the obtained data compared to the first control curve. The results were analyzed by one-way ANOVA software from Microcal Origin 4.1. The aorta rings were used once for each compound. In view of the important anti-adrenergic profile evidenced for the new 1- benzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl-2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)hexahydro-1-pyrazinyl]ethane derivative (LASSBio 772) in phenylephrine induced vasoconstriction assays in thoracic aorta of rabbit, it was pharrmacologically evaluated regarding the affinity in \"binding\" studies, through the assay in salivary gland, selective for \n\nalpha 1A subtypes, and rat liver, selective for alpha 1 B subtypes, using [<sup>3</sup>H]prazosin as ligand.</p>In vitro binding assay- homogeneized tissues Binding assay (in vitro) in rat salivary gland and liver The potency of the selected compound, 1-benzo[d][1 ,3]dioxol-5-yl-2-[4- (2-methoxyphenyl)hexahydro-1 -pyrazinyljethane (LASSBio 772), was determined through method of an assay based on the use of 96 well microplates MultiScreen-PH 96 (Millipore), with final volume of 200 microL, in which a phosphocellulose filter paper was placed in each lower well following the binding of positive charged substrate after the washing/filtering step. The test-compound concentrations, LASSBio 772, for obtaining competition curves varied from 3 pM to 100 nM. Thus, 0.1 microg of membrane proteins expressing the rat alpha 1A subtype (salivary gland) or alpha 1B (liver) were added in 50 mM Tris-HCI (pH 7,5) buffer solution to each microplate well. After 60 minutes of incubation at 22\u00b0C, the reaction was concluded by fast filtration through glass fiber filters (Packard Instruments CO., Meriden, CT). The filters were rinsed 3 times with 3 mL of buffer solution cooled in an ice bath. The radioactivity levels were determined using a liquid scintillation counter in the Top-Count instrument. The competition curves were analyzed with the use of the capability of overlapping curves from GraphSAP Prism software (GraphSAP Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). The rat tissues (salivary gland, liver) after homogenization, centrifugation, re-suspension and re-centrifugation, were incubated with [<sup>3</sup>HJprazosin (0.06 nM), in 60 mM Tris-HCI (pH 7,5) buffe",
    " these experiments the compound was not able to significantly inhibit the contractions (n= 3, % of Contraction = 122.1 \u00b1 8.6). In another experiment the compound was evaluated for its capability to inhibit the relaxation produced by salbutamol (10<sup>\"1</sup>\u00b0 - 3,3 x10<sup>\"5</sup> M), beta 2 adrenergic agonist, in strips of cobaio trachea pre-contracted with carbacol (10 microM). In this experiment the compound also was not able to inhibit significantly the relaxing effect of salbutamol (n= 4). However, the evaluation of this compound in comparison to the contractions induced by histamine (100 microM), Hi receptors agonist, the compound LASSBio 772 (3 nM - 30 microM), was able to significantly inhibit contractions, showing an IC<sub>50</sub> = 309 nM (IC<sub>50</sub> = concentration able to inhibit 50% of the effect). These results corroborate with a good profile of alpha adrenergic antagonist selectivity, dissociated of effects of other receptors, for the compound LASSBio 772, having in mind that it did not present any activity in comparison to the muscarinic cholinergic and/or beta 2 adrenergic receptors. Besides the observed effect in comparison to Hi receptors, it is valid to stress that alpha-adrenergic antagonist evaluation yielded an IC<sub>50</sub>0,26 nM, while its Hi anti-histaminergic effect yielded an IC<sub>5</sub>o 309 nM, that gives a selectivity ratio of about 1000 times for the alpha-adrenergic antagonist effect in relation to the H1 antagonist effect.</p>Binding assay (in vitro) in human prostatic tissues Binding assays of [<sup>3</sup>Hl-prazosin: The human prostatic membranes preparations are obtained according to the protocol described by Wong and collaborators (J. Med. Chem., 41, 2643- 2660, 1998) and Muramatsu and collaborators (Br. J. Urol., 74, 572-678, 1994). For the experiment (150 \u03bcg protein/tube), [<sup>3</sup>H]-prazosin 0,3 nM was used in the \n\npresence and absence of pharmaceuticals (0,1 - 100 \u03bcM), incubated for 45 min in medium containing 50 mM Tris-HCI, 1 mM EDTA (pH 7.4) at 25 \u00b0C. The reaction is ended by the addition of cold buffer (4 x 5 ml), followed by vacuum filtration in glass fiber filters (GF/C), and the nonspecific binding defined by addition of cold prazosin (1 \u03bcM). The radioactivity retained in the filter is determined through liquid scintillation spectrometry. The protein dosage follows the method described by Lowry et al (1951). In the case of existing antagonism in these receptors the addition of increasing concentrations of pharmaceuticals dislocates the specific binding of [<sup>3</sup>H]-prazosin to the alpha-adrenergic receptor, from which it is calculated the inhibitory potency through IC<sub>50</sub> (pharmaceutical concentration that inhibits the specific binding in 50%). The preliminary results demonstrated high affinity of LASSBio 772 for the prostatic tissue with antagonist potency, pK<sub>B</sub> 9.30 (0.5 nM), corroborating its potential use as an antagonist for the prostatic obstruc",
