    ". RB5 peptide enhanced striatal ERK phosphorylation (d) and promoted a selective activation of nuclear ERK-dependent signalling and gene transcription (pMSK, pAcH3, pELK, c-Fos (e-h)). In contrast, RB5 did not influence the phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic markers (pMEK-1, pVGK+, pS6). m-o) a single administration of RB5 induced a significant activation of pERK and pAcH3 in ERK1 WT mice while this effect did not reach the statistical significance in ERK1 KO mice suggesting that RB5 acts like ERK1 inhibitor. As additional control we showed that phosphorylation of S6 was comparable in both genotypes confirming that RB5 preferentially activates nuclear signalling. Two-way ANOVA Bonferroni post hoc comparison: one black star, p&lt;0.05, two black stars, p&lt;0.01, one white star, p&lt;0.001. p) Dose response curve of RB5 peptide for ERK activation. 200 \u03bcm thick striatal slices were freshly prepared from 2-month old mice and transferred into a perfusion chamber for 1 h at 32\u00b0 C. Slices were pre-treated with different doses of RB5 or scrambled control. After 1 h, slices for each dose was fixed in PFA 4% for 15 min. 18 \u03bcm cryo-sections were processed for immunohistochemistry with anti-phospho p44/p42 MAP kinase. Neuronal quantification was performed with ImageJ software by counting the number of phospho-ERK positive cells in each slice. The level of activation is expressed on the Y-axis as arbitrary units (AU). Doses are reported in a logarithmic scale (Log 10) on the X-axis. The EC50 was calculated using GraphPad Prism software. RB5 was effective in enhancing pERK with an EC50 of 3.4 \u03bcM.</p>FIG. 2. Time course and dose response studies for RB5 on ERK activation.</p>a) Wild type mice (n=5 each group) were injected with RB5 (20 mg/kg, i.p.) or scramble inactive peptide (SCR, 20 mg/kg, i.p.). Mice injected with RB5 were perfused at different time points, whereas scramble-injected mice were perfused after 1 hour. Immunohistochemical analysis was carried out against phospho-p44/p42 MAP kinase (Thr202/Tyr204). Quantification of phospho-ERK positive cells in the dorsal striatum shows that phospho-ERK levels were significantly increased up to 6 hours after the injection of RB5 and they returned to the basal levels after 12 h hours. One-way ANOVA F<sub>5,29</sub>=9.137, p&lt;0.0001. Bonferroni's post-hoc test, SCR vs RB5 1 h: p&lt;0.001, SCR vs RB5 6 h: p&lt;0.001. Data are expressed as Mean\u00b1SEM. b) Wild type mice (n=5 each group) were systemically injected with different doses of RB5 or with 20 mg/kg of scramble inactive peptide (SCR) and perfused 1 hour after. Immunohistochemical analysis was carried out against phospho-p44/p42 MAP kinase (Thr202/Tyr204). Quantification of phospho-ERK positive cells in the dorsal striatum shows that RB5 activate ERK in a dose-dependent manner. One-way ANOVA: F<sub>5,29</sub>=7.097, p&lt;0.001. Bonferroni's post-hoc test, SCR vs RB5 20 mg/kg: p&lt;0.05, SCR vs RB5 10 mg/kg: p&lt;0.01. Data are expressed as Mean\u00b1SEM. c) RB5 brain levels measured with mass spectrometry at different hours after a single i.p. administrati"
