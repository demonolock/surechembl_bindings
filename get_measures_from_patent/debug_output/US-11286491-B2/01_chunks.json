    " in the following description of embodiments and drawings thereof, and from the claims.</p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSFIG. 1 depicts results of a Congo-Red plate assay where the presence of extracellular amyloid fibers is shown by red staining of the culture spots. The data was obtained from a LSR10 strain.</p>FIG. 2 depicts results of a whole-cell immunodotblot analysis for FLAG tag functionality. Accessible FLAG epitopes on CsgA-FLAG chimeras with different linker domains were probed using anti-FLAG antibodies conjugated to fluorescent DyLight 680. The data was obtained from a LSR10 strain.</p>FIG. 3 depicts in schematic a strategy for optimized linker design showing the effect of optimized linker on functional polypeptide (\u201cmaterial\u201d) performance. Unoptimized linker domains may hinder the performance of the biofilm-based material by occluding binding sites for the functional domains, preventing proper folding of either domain, hindering assembly of the amyloid fibers, or hindering secretion. Optimized linkers minimize these issues, thereby improving the desired function of the material overall.</p>FIG. 4 is a graph depicting expression of curli nanofibers fused with trefoil factor proteins determined by a CR absorbance assay for various CsgA-TFF constructs with various length flexible linker domains. The data was obtained from a PHL628 strain.</p>FIG. 5 is a graph depicting expression of curli nanofibers fused with gut binding short peptide domains using a Congo red binding assay of wild type CsgA compared to CsgA fused to four different peptides that have been shown to bind to specific gut tissues. The data was obtained from a PHL628 strain.</p>FIG. 6 is a graph depicting adhesion of LSR10 cells harboring gut-binding domains to Caco-2 cells where constructs with the F48 linker and containing trefoil domains TTF1, TTF2, and TTF3, or small peptides T18, A1, CP15 and P8 were tested for in vitro binding to Caco-2 monolayers. Bound cells were recovered and quantified by CFU analysis.</p>FIG. 7 is a graph depicting adhesion of PHL628 cells producing engineered curli fibers to Caco-2 cell monolayers. When no curli is produced, adhesion decreases significantly, suggesting that the wild type curli fibers may play a role in adhesion to epithelial surfaces. TTF1 and TTF3 increase adhesion to the epithelial surface.</p>FIG. 8A-8D depict construction of a construction of a csgA deletion mutant of Nissle 1917. FIG. 8A depicts a Lambda red recombination strategy for the deletion of the csgA gene in Nissle. FIG. 8B depicts PCR validation of the chloramphenicol cassette insertion at the csgA locus identifies two positive clones (black arrows). FIG. 8C depicts these two clones were verified for the presence of the 265, 158, and 1113 bp amplicons. FIG. 8D depicts sequencing verification of the regions flanking the csgA gene indicates successful CAT cassette integration (highlighted in yellow) (SEQ ID NO:2).</p>FIG. 9 is a graph depicting adhesion of Nissl",
    "ered orally, such as a single dose, to the healthy mouse gut followed by a period of normal feeding. Residence time of the engineered strains will be measured by CFU counting from fecal samples collected daily. Spatial localization within the gut will be monitored by harvesting the gut tissue, sectioning, and tracking the presence of engineered strains by CFU counts from homogenized tissues and immune staining of histological tissue slices.</p>Several linkers were tested in a library of polypeptide domains that are known to bind to gut epithelia in a localized manner. Known as trefoil factors (TFFs), this polypeptide family consists of 3 identified peptides (TFF1, TFF2, and TFF3), that are secreted by the gastrointestinal mucosa and differentially bind to different areas of the gastrointestinal tract. All trefoil factors have in common a trefoil domain, which consists of three conserved disulfide bonds. The sequence for each TFF construct engineered into a CsgA-linker is shown in Table 2 above.</p>TFF1 contains a single trefoil domain of 60 amino acids. TFF2 contains two homologous trefoil domains, resulting in a total of 6 disulfide bonds, and is over 100 amino acids in length. Various constructs were made containing CsgA fused to the TFF2 via the flexible linkers identified in the preceding experiments. For the single trefoil domain construct (TFF1), longer flexible linker domains resulted in a marked improvement in expression levels as measured by a quantitative Congo Red binding assay (FIG. 4).</p>TFF1 showed nearly a 5-fold increase when the flexible linker length was increased from 24 to 48 residues. In contrast, TFF2 showed no improvement as a function of linker length, which may be due to the complexity of the protein (6 disulfides) or larger length (&gt;100 amino acids).</p>Various short peptides (7-12 amino acids) were tested, using the F48 linker as shown in Table 4.</p>TABLE\u20034BIND\u2003Variants\u2003for\u2003Small\u2003Peptide\u2003Gut\u2003Epithelial\u2003Tissues.Peptide\u2003domainPlasmid\u2003NameSequenceGut\u2003LocalizationRef.pBbE1a-CsgA-F48-LTHPQDSPPASAInjured\u2003epithelial\u2003cellsCostantini\u2003TW,\u2003etT18(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u200325)al.<sup>1</sup> pBbE1a-CsgA-F48-VHLGYATColon\u2003cancerZhang\u2003Y,\u2003et\u2003al.<sup>2</sup>CP15(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u200326) pBbE1a-CsgA-F48-LETTCASLCYPSM\u2003cells,\u2003FAEHiggins\u2003L\u2003et\u2003al.<sup>3</sup>P8(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u200327) pBbE1a-CsgA-F48-VRPMPLQColon\u2003cancerHsiung\u2003PL\u2003et\u2003al.<sup>4</sup>A1(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u200328)</p>These peptides have been identified through phage-display techniques for binding to the intestinal mucosa.
