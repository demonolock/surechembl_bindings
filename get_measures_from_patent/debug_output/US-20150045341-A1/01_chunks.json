These compounds may be assessed for their ability to activate or block activation of the human S1P1 receptor in cells stably expressing the S1P1 receptor.</p>GTP \u03b3<sup>35</sup>S binding was measured in the medium containing (mM) HEPES 25, pH 7.4, MgCl<sub>2 </sub>10, NaCl 100, dithiothreitol 0.5, digitonin 0.003%, 0.2 nM GTP \u03b3<sup>35</sup>S, and 5 \u03bcg membrane protein in a volume of 150 \u03bcl. Test compounds were included in the concentration range from 0.08 to 5,000 nM unless indicated otherwise. Membranes were incubated with 100 \u03bcM 5\u2032-adenylylimidodiphosphate for 30 min, and subsequently with 10 \u03bcM GDP for 10 min on ice. Drug solutions and membrane were mixed, and then reactions were initiated by adding GTP \u03b3<sup>35</sup>S and continued for 30 min at 25\u00b0 C. Reaction mixtures were filtered over Whatman GF/B filters under vacuum, and washed three times with 3 mL of ice-cold buffer (HEPES 25, pH7.4, MgCl<sub>2 </sub>10 and NaCl 100). Filters were dried and mixed with scintillant, and counted for <sup>35</sup>S activity using a \u03b2-counter. Agonist-induced GTP \u03b3<sup>35</sup>S binding was obtained by subtracting that in the absence of agonist. Binding data were analyzed using a non-linear regression method. In case of antagonist assay, the reaction mixture contained 10 nM S1P1 in the presence of test antagonist at concentrations ranging from 0.08 to 5000 nM.
