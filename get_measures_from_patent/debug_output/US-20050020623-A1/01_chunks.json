A compound is orally, intravenously or intraperitoneally administered to the OVX mouse at a dose of 0.1 to 1,000 mg/kg, preferably 0.1 to 100 mg/kg, and deciduous dental roots are measured, or weight of skeletal bones is measured. The usefulness as a medicament for bone disease can be confirmed based on an action for suppressing periodontal breakdowns, or an action for suppressing skeletal bone weight loss. </p> Usefulness of the compounds of the present invention represented by the aforementioned formula (1) as active ingredients of medicaments for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatment of AIDS can be confirmed by using, for example, a rhesus monkey model of SIV-infection (Crub S. et al., Acta Neuropathol., 101(2), pp.85-91, 2001) or the like. Effectiveness as a medicament for AIDS can be confirmed by orally, intravenously or intraperitoneally administering a compound to the model animal at a dose of 0.1 to 1,000 mg/kg, preferably 0.1 to 100 mg/kg, and quantifying the SIV mRNA level in blood. </p> Usefulness of the compounds of the present invention represented by the aforementioned formula (1) as active ingredients of medicaments for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatment of cancer can be confirmed by using, for example, a mouse model of ultraviolet ray irradiation-induced skin cancer, a nude mouse model of tumor xenograft (Orengo I. F. et al., Arch Dermatol., 138(6), pp.823-4, 2002; Ki D. W. et al., Anticancer Res., 22(2A), pp.777-88, 2002) or the like. Effectiveness as a medicament for cancer can be confirmed by orally, intravenously or intraperitoneally administering a compound to a model animal at a dose of 0.1 to 1,000 mg/kg, preferably 0.1 to 100 mg/kg, and observing progression or reduction of the grafted cancer tissues on the body surface. </p> Further, when test compounds of the compounds of the present invention or salts thereof were introduced into wells of a 96-well plate at a concentration three times higher than the IC<sub>50 </sub>values obtained in Test Example 1, and the cell suspension prepared in Test Example 1 was added at a density of 10<sup>6</sup>/well, incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature and stained with trypan blue to determine the survival rates of the cells, a viability as high as 90% or more was observed in all the wells. Furthermore, when the compounds of the present invention or salts thereof were orally administered to mice every day at a dose of 30 mg/kg for 5 days, death was not observed. Therefore, the compounds of the present invention had no particular problem also in safety. </p> As the active ingredients of the medicaments of the present invention, the compounds represented by the aforementioned formula (1), and physiologically acceptable salts thereof can be used. The aforementioned substance, per se, may be administrated as the medicament of the present invention. A pharmaceutical composition containing one",
    "se mentioned above are examples for selection of the medicament for combinational use, and the medicament for combinational use is not limited to the examples mentioned above. </p>EXAMPLES  The present invention will be further specifically explained with reference to examples. However, the scope of the present invention is not limited to the following examples. </p> For thin layer chromatography (TLC), Precoated Silica Gel 60 F254 (produced by Merck) was used. After development with chloroform:methanol (100:1 to 4:1), or ethyl acetate:n-hexane (100:1 to 1:10), spots were observed by UV irradiation (254 nm) or coloration with ninhydrine or phosphomolybdic acid. For drying organic solvent, anhydrous magnesium sulfate or anhydrous sodium sulfate was used. For flash column chromatography, Silica gel 60N (spherical shape, neutral, 40 to 100 \u03bcm, produced by Kanto Chemicals) was used. For preparative thin layer chromatography (PTLC), Precoated Silica Gel 60 F254 (20\u00d720 cm, thickness: 2 mm, produced by Merck) was used. Elution was performed with hexane:ethyl acetate=1:0 to 0:1, or chloroform:ethanol=10:1 to 1:1. For the measurement of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, the measurement was performed by using Gemini-300 (FT-NMR, produced by Varian), or AL-300 (FT-NMR, produced by JOEL). As a solvent, deuterated chloroform was used, unless otherwise indicated. Chemical shifts were measured by using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard, and indicated with \u03b4 (ppm), and binding constant was indicated with J (Hz). Mass spectrum (MS) was measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Platform-LC type mass spectrometry apparatus (produced by Micromass) was used as the mass spectrometer, and the measurement was performed by the electrospray ionization (ESI) method. As the liquid chromatography apparatus, an apparatus produced by GILSON was used. As the separation column, Mightysil RP-18 GP 50-4.6 (produced by Kanto Chemicals) was used. Elution was generally performed at a flow rate of 2 ml/minute using a linear gradient of 5 to 100% (v/v) Solution B [acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid] in Solution A [water containing 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid] from 0 minute to 5 minutes as the solvent. </p>Example 1  N-[(5-Isoquinolyl)sulfonyl]-N-(3-phenylpropyl)-1,3-propylenediamine hydrochloride (Exemplary Compound No. 3-35) </p> (Step A) Synthesis of N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-N\u2032-[(5-isoquinolyl)sulfonyl]-1,3-propylenediamine (Intermediate 1) </p> A solution of N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-1,3-propylenediamine (2.09 g, Tokyo Kasei Kogyo) and triethylamine (3.4 ml, Tokyo Kasei Kogyo) in dichloromethane (20 ml) was added with a solution of isoquinoline-5-sulfonyl chloride (2.73 g, prepared according to Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication (Kokai) No. 61-227581) in dichloromethane (15 ml) with stirring and ice cooling and stirred at room temperature for 14 hours and 30 minutes.
