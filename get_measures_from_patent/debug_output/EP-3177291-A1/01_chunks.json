    "-3-(trifluoromethyl)anilino]cyclohexanol (23 g; 75 mmol) are dissolved in a mixture of tetrahydrofuran (5 mL) and dichloromethane (250 mL). Sodium iodide (11.4 g; 75 mmol) and sodium hydroxide (10.9 g; 264 mmol) are added and the resulting mixture is stirred at reflux for 5 h. After cooling to room temperature, water (250 mL) is added and the two phases are stirred for 5 min. The organic phase is separated and the aqueous phase is extracted twice with dichloromethane (250 mL each). The combined organic layers are washed with aq. sat. sodium chloride (500 mL), dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford the desired product as a crude. Recrystallization from ethanol yield the desired product in pure form (18.5 g; 31 mmol). The structure was confirmed using Protocol I-E. Calculated mass = 588; observed mass = 588; HPLC retention time = 2.24 min (compound 267). </p>[202] Example 268. Determining activity against Dirofilaria immitis </p> Microfilariae recovered from D. immitis infected dogs were plated in 96-well plates under sterile conditions. L3 larvae of D. immitis were recovered from infected mosquitoes and allowed to molt into L4 stages required for compound testing. L4 larvae were plated in 96- well plates under sterile conditions. DMSO solutions of the compounds were added into parasite-containing plates. After compound addition, parasites were incubated for 3 days prior to assessment of viability. Microfilaricidal activity is reported as a half maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>). Effects on L4 larvae are reported as the lowest doses that result in complete loss of motility (MIC<sub>100</sub>). </p> Compounds according to Examples 267, 263 (see WO2009/077527), 247 (see </p>WO2009/077527), 195 (see WO2009/077527), 194 (see WO2009/077527), 183 (see WO2009/077527), 180 (see WO2009/077527), 160 (see WO2009/077527), 57 (see WO2009/077527), 13 (see WO2009/077527) and 12 (see WO2009/077527) exhibited EC<sub>50</sub> values of less than 10 \u03bc\u039c against D. immitis microfilariae.
