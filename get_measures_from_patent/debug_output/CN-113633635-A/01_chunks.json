    "value after the drug is added, and the positive result is Verapami (Verapamil) with the concentration of 30 mu M.</p>The results show that HCQ at different concentrations had no significant inhibitory effect on cav1.2 channels (fig. 2D-E).</p>Detection of the Effect of HCQ on myocardial sodium ion channels</p>(1) Human Nav1.5 sodium ion channels were overexpressed in HEK293 cells, and round slides with HEK293 hNav1.5 cells attached were transferred to a cell bath on an inverted microscope platform in an electrophysiological experimental system.</p>(2) And (3) perfusing extracellular fluid containing HCQ with different concentrations, and continuously recording until the inhibition effect of the drug on Nav1.5 current reaches a stable state, wherein the peak value of the inward current is the current value after drug addition. The steady state criterion is determined by whether the nearest consecutive 3 current traces coincide. Amitriptyline (Amitriptyline) at 10. mu.M served as a positive control.</p>(3) In the experiment, the effect of HCQ on hNav1.5 sodium ion channel current at different concentrations is evaluated by measuring the maximum current values of the control group and the HCQ treatment group, and calculating the ratio (Mean +/-SE) of the maximum current value (absolute value) of the HCQ treatment group to the maximum current value (absolute value) of the control group.</p>The results show that although HCQ has a weak inhibitory effect on the nav1.5 ion channel (IC50 \u2550 36.42 \u03bc M) (fig. 2F-G), the effect on this ion channel was clinically insignificant when IC50 was greater than 20 \u03bc M according to FDA guidelines.</p>Example 3: effect of Hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate on myocardial cell mitochondrial oxidative stress</p>1. Fluorescence staining detection of primary rat myocardial cells</p>(1) Inoculation: inoculating primary milk rat myocardial cells into a 24-well plate with a density of 6 \u00d7 10 per well<sup>4</sup>Placing the cells in a cell culture box containing 5% of carbon dioxide and 95% of air and culturing at 37 \u2103 for 12 h;</p>(2) cells were treated with 25. mu.M, 50. mu.M, 100. mu.M HCQ or 25. mu.M, 50. mu.M, 100. mu.M CQ, and stained with Rho123 and Hoechst 6 hours after the treatment, specifically Rhodamine 123 (Biyunyun day, C2007) and Hoechst 33342 (Biyunyun day, C1022) according to the instructions, and recorded by photography. Normally, the inner and outer membranes of mitochondria maintain a certain potential difference, and when mitochondria are damaged, the potential difference of the inner and outer membranes of mitochondria is destroyed, so that the membrane potential is reduced. When the membrane potential decreases, Rho123 enters mitochondria and fluoresces. Therefore, the fluorescence intensity of Rho123 can be used as an indirect indication of the degree of mitochondrial membrane potential impairment.</p>The experimental results show that as the concentration of HCQ and CQ increases, the mitochondrial membrane potential decreases more significantly (fig. 3A), suggesting mitochondrial"
