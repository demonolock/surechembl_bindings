    "een found to comprise 6 discrete ASIC subunits: ASIC1 which has isoforms ASICIa (amino acid sequence database entry NP_064423.2 Gl:21536351) and ASICIb (NP_001086.2 Gl:21536349) (also known as ASIC\u03b1 or BNaC2\u03b1 and ASIC\u03b2 or BNaC2\u03b2, respectively), ASIC2 which has isoforms ASIC2a (NP_899233.1 Gl:34452695) and ASIC2b (NPJ301085.2 Gl:9998944) (also known as MDEG1, BNaCI \u03b1 or BNC1 and MDEG2 or BNACI\u03b2, respectively), ASIC3 (NPJD04760.1 GI:4757710) (also known as DRASIC or TNaC) and ASIC4 (NP_898843.1 GI:33942102) (also known as SPASIC).</p>In one embodiment, the ASIC receptor antagonist is an ASICIa receptor antagonist. \n\n The ASIC3 receptor is expressed mostly in the brain (Krishtal, O. Trends in Neurosciences 2003, 26:477-483)). In an alternative embodiment, the ASIC receptor antagonist is an ASIC3 receptor antagonist. The ASIC3 receptor is believed to be the most H+ sensitive of all isoforms and opens when the pH drops from 7.4 to 7.0 (Immke, D.C. and McCleskey, E.W., 2003, Neuron, 37, 75-84).</p>In the above embodiments, it is preferred that the ASIC antagonist is selective for the isoform concerned, i.e. that it antagonises the isoform concerned more strongly that the other ASIC isoforms. ASIC antagonism can be measured by the following method: COS cells transfected with ASIC1 a, ASIC2a, ASIC3 or a combination of the subunits are voltage clamped at 260 mV and subjected to a pH drop. Inhibition of the antagonist at different compound concentrations and pH can be measured and the IC50 value determined. Selectivity is defined by a ten times greater inhibition of one ASICIa or ASIC3 transfected cells in comparison with the cells transfected with the other subunits. (Escoubas P. et al. J Biol Chem. 2000, 275, 25116-25121 ; Diochet S. et al. EMBO. 2004, 23,1516-1525.).</p>It will be appreciated that an ASIC antagonist is any such agent capable of antagonising, inhibiting, blocking or down-regulating the ASIC receptor.</p>An ASIC receptor antagonist may have no effect on the level of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in brain or other neural cells of the individual to whom it is administered, and, in particular, may not decrease or reduce over-expression or increased synthesis of APP.</p>An ASIC receptor antagonist may have no effect on immune or inflammatory responses in the individual. For example, administration of the ASIC receptor antagonist may have no effect on the expression of TNF or display any other immunomodulatory, immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory effects.</p>The term \"ASIC antagonist\" as used herein, covers pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates of these compounds.</p>In one embodiment, the ASIC receptor antagonist comprises 3,5-diamino-N- (aminoiminomethyl)-6-chloropyrazinecarboxamide (amiloride, CAS registry number 2609-46- 3; compound of formula (I)): \n\n \n<img id=\"imgf000011_0001\" path=\"imgf000011_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/85337851/WO/20080117/A2/002008/00/71/31/imgf000011_0001.tif\"/>\n</p>(I)<"
