    "ithout competition with endogenous SIRP\u03b1 of the non-human animal. Further, therapies and pharmaceuticals for use in xenotransplantation can be improved and/or developed in such non-human animals.</p>Non-human animals of the present invention provide an improved in vivo system for maintenance and development of human hematopoietic stem cells through engraftment. In various embodiments, non-human animals of the present invention provide improved development and maintenance of human stem cells within the non-human animal. In various embodiments, increased populations of differentiated human B and T cells are observed in the blood, bone marrow, spleen and thymus of the non-human animal. In various embodiments, non-human animals of the present invention provide an increase in the level of engraftment of human cells as compared to non-human animals that express both mouse and human SIRP\u03b1.</p>Non-human animals of the present invention can be employed to assess the efficacy of a therapeutic drug targeting human cells. In various embodiments, a non-human animal of the present invention is transplanted with human cells, and a drug candidate targeting such human cells is administered to such animal. The therapeutic efficacy of the drug is then determined by monitoring the human cells in the non-human animal after the administration of the drug. Drugs that can be tested in the non-human animals include both small molecule compounds, i.e., compounds of molecular weights of less than 1500 kD, 1200 kD, 1000 kD, or 800 dalton, and large molecular compounds (such as proteins, e.g., antibodies), which have intended therapeutic effects for the treatment of human diseases and conditions by targeting (e.g., binding to and/or acting on) human cells.</p>In some embodiments, the drug is an anti-cancer drug, and the human cells are cancer cells, which can be cells of a primary cancer or cells of cell lines established from a primary cancer. In these embodiments, a non-human animal of the present invention is transplanted with human cancer cells, and an anticancer drug is given to the non-human animal. The efficacy of the drug can be determined by assessing whether growth or metastasis of the human cancer cells in the non-human animal is inhibited as a result of the administration of the drug.</p>In specific embodiments, the anti-cancer drug is an antibody molecule which binds to an antigen on human cancer cells. In particular embodiments, the anti-cancer drug is a bispecific antibody that binds to an antigen on human cancer cells, and to an antigen on other human cells, for example, cells of the human immune system (or \u201chuman immune cells\u201d) such as B cells and T cells.</p>In some embodiments, a non-human animal of the present invention is engrafted with human immune cells or cells that differentiate into human immune cells. Such non-human animal with engrafted human immune cells is transplanted with human cancer cells, and is administered with an anti-cancer drug, such as a bispecific ant"
