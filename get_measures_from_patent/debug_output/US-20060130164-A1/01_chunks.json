    "MyD88 DN (encodes dominant negative mutant of MyD88); IL-1R/AcP (encodes ILI-1 receptor and receptor accessory protein); TLR9 (encodes full length TLR9). Shaded triangles below the constructs indicate that increasing amounts of that construct was added. </p>FIG. 3, comprising FIGS. 3A and 3B, is a pair of images of immunoblots demonstrating co-immunoprecipitation of TIRAP with TLR4 and MyD88. Cells were transfected in the presence (+) or absence (\u2212) of constructs encoding a wild-type portion of TLR4 (TLR4 wt), a mutant derivative thereof (TLR4 mut), wild-type TIRAP (TIRAP), a mutant TIRAP containing a P125H mutation (TIRAP PH), or wild-type MyD88 (MyD88), wherein each construct further encodes a Myc, Flag, or hemaglutanin (HA) tag, as indicated. Antibodies used for immunoprecipitation (IP) or immunoblot (IB) are indicated to the left of each blot. </p>FIG. 4, comprising FIGS. 4A through 4C, is a series of images of immunoblots demonstrating that PKR co-immunoprecipitates with TIRAP and is a component of LPS and CpG-signaling pathways. (A) Bone marrow-derived macrophages from either wild-type (WT) or MyD88-deficient (MyD88<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup>) mice were stimulated for the indicated time periods (minutes) with either LPS or CpG, and immunoblots were performed using an antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated PKR (PKR-P). B and C Cells were transfected with constructs encoding Flag-tagged TIRAP and either a construct encoding an HA-tagged kinase dead mutant of PKR (HA PKR KD) or p58, as indicated. Antibodies used for immunoprecipitation (IP) or immnoblot (IB) are indicated to the left of each blot, and arrows on the right show the location of the indicated proteins. </p>FIG. 5, comprising FIGS. 5A through 5D, is a series of blots depicting inhibition of LPS- but not CpG-induced NF-\u03baB activation, PKR phosphorylation, and JNK phosphorylation by TIRAP. (A) TIRAP peptide, but not a reverse sequence peptide, inhibited LPS-induced NF-\u03baB activation. RAW \u03baB cells pretreated for 1 h with either the TIRAP or control peptide were stimulated with LPS (10 ng/ml) for 5 h. Samples were stimulated in duplicate. (B) Pretreatment of RAW cells with TIRAP peptide blocks LPS-induced I\u03baB-\u03b1 degradation. RAW cells pretreated with the TIRAP peptide as indicated were either left unstimulated or stimulated with LPS (10 ng/ml) for the indicated time periods. Lysates (30 \u03bcg/sample) were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with an anti-I\u03baB-\u03b1 antibody to assess I\u03baB-\u03b1 degradation. (C) TIRAP peptide inhibited LPS- but not CpG-induced NF-\u03baB activity. RAW \u03baB cells pretreated with the TIRAP peptide as indicated were stimulated with either LPS or CpG and harvested for reporter assay. (D) TIRAP peptide inhibited PKR and JNK phosphorylation induced by LPS but not CpG. RAW cells either untreated or pretreated with 40 \u03bcM of the TIRAP peptide were stimulated with either LPS or CpG as indicated. Lysates (30 \u03bcg/sample) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting wit",
    "S:9 and 10 are mutated forms of the binding domain of the polypeptides set forth in SEQ ID NO:3 and 4, respectively, the TIRAP polypeptide. </p> Preferably, an effective TIRAP inhibitor polypeptide of the present invention has an encoded histidine to proline mutation at amino acid position 145 (as measured in mouse TIRAP, shown in FIG. 1), or the proline to histidine mutation at amino acid position 125 (as measured in human TIRAP, also shown in FIG. 1 and referenced in the Figures as P125H) relative to the TIRAP polypeptide which does not have the encoded mutation. The mutation may be accomplished using techniques well understood to those of skill in the art. </p> It has been found that the histidine to proline mutation at the appropriate position enables a TIRAP inhibitor to bind to the cytoplasmic domain of TLR4, yet inhibit downstream signaling of TLR4 (both MyD88 dependent and MyD88 independent signaling). </p> Without ascribing to a particular theory of cellular receptor signaling, it is believed that TIRAP inhibitors, as well as other polypeptides that are sufficiently homologous to TIRAP inhibitors or TIRAP inhibitor mimetics which have TIRAP inhibitor activity, bind to TLR4. This binding is conceptually illustrated in FIG. 7. Once bound, the TIRAP inhibitor can inhibit TLR4 signaling through the MyD88 dependent pathway as well as the MyD88 independent pathway. </p> As suggested in the preceding paragraph, an organic compound, typically with a molecular weight under 2 KD, having appropriate structural similarity to a TIRAP inhibitor polypeptide may be also used as a TIRAP inhibitor. For example, a small molecule mimetic may be used. As one of skill in the art understands, small molecule mimetics are chemically synthesized compounds that provide the spatial conformation necessary to properly associate to a particular protein and elicit a response. Therefore, the present invention also comprises the use of a small molecule mimetic to inhibit TRAP signaling. </p> Fusion Proteins </p> A further aspect of the invention also relates to polynucleotides encoding fusion proteins. Examples of fusion protein technology can be found in International Patent Application Nos. WO 94/29458 and WO 94/22914, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. </p> This particular embodiment of the present invention relates to fusion proteins comprising a TRAP inhibitor polypeptide, or an active portion or active fragment thereof, and a cellular membrane transport protein, such as Antennapedia. As one of skill in the art understands, delivering proteins across the cell membrane so they become therapeutically active can be difficult. Viruses or virus fragments can be used to transport proteins into cells, but this technology is not universally approved. Antennapedia, obtained from the fruit fly Drosophila, is virtually identical to the human form of the protein and thus, there is little, if any, antigenic response in human use. Even though proteins can",

The transgene is used to transform a cell, meaning that a permanent or transient genetic change, preferably a permanent genetic change, is induced in a cell following incorporation of exogenous DNA. A permanent genetic change is generally achieved by introduction of the DNA into the genome of the cell. Vectors for stable integration include plasmids, retroviruses and other animal viruses, YACs, and the like. Of interest are transgenic mammals, e.g. cows, pigs, goats, horses, etc., and particularly rodents, e.g. rats, mice, etc. </p> Transgenic animals include an exogenous nucleic acid sequence present as an extrachromosomal element or stably integrated in all or a portion of its cells, especially in germ cells. Unless otherwise indicated, it will be assumed that a transgenic animal includes stable changes to the germline sequence. During the initial construction of the animal, \u201cchimeras\u201d or \u201cchimeric animals\u201d are generated, in which only a subset of cells have the altered genome. Chimeras are primarily used for breeding purposes in order to generate the desired transgenic animal. Animals having a heterozygous alteration are generated by breeding of chimeras. Male and female heterozygotes are typically bred to generate homozygous animals. </p> In the present invent",
    "end, bone marrow-derived macrophages from either wild-type or MyD88-deficient mice were stimulated for the indicated time periods with either LPS (10 ng/ml) or CpG (10 \u03bcM), then washed in PBS and lysed in TNT lysis buffer. Because PKR is phosphorylated on a threonine residue upon activation, activation of PKR was assayed by immunoblotting lysates (40 \u03bcg/sample), resolved by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, with an antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated PKR. Activated, phosphorylated PKR was detectable in LPS-stimulated wild-type macrophages (FIG. 4A). Interestingly, phosphorylated PKR was also detected in LPS-stimulated MyD88-deficient macrophages, although a significantly smaller fraction of PKR is phosphorylated in these cells. In addition, MyD88-deficient cells activate PKR with slower kinetics, similar to the delayed kinetics of NF-\u03baB and JNK activation. These observations strongly suggest that, in response to LPS stimulation, PKR is activated by MyD88-dependent as well as MyD88-independent mechanisms. If the MyD88-dependent pathway can activate PKR in response to LPS, it is conceivable that PKR may be activated by other TLRs. Therefore, PKR activation in response to CpG stimulation was tested. Indeed, PKR is phosphorylated in response to CpG (FIG. 4A), indicating that PKR is a component of the TLR9 pathway as well as the TLR4-pathway. </p> To determine whether PKR and TIRAP interact, lysates from 293T cells transfected with either 3.5 \u03bcg of an HA PKR kinase dead (KD) mutant or 1.5 \u03bcg of Flag TIRAP were subjected to immunoprecipitation analyses as described above, followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. The PKR KD mutant rather than wild type PKR was used because overexpressing PKR induces cell death. PKR did, in fact, co-immunoprecipitate with TIRAP (FIG. 4B), further supporting the link between PKR and TIRAP established above. </p> Because TIRAP may not regulate PKR directly, the interaction between TIRAP and two other proteins, p58 and PACT, was analyzed. p58 is a tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein that negatively regulates PKR activity (Lee 1994), and PACT is a dsRNA-binding domain-containing protein that activates PKR in response to cellular stress (Patel 19980). Lysates from 293T cells transfected with either p58-encoding vector (3.5 \u03bcg) or PACT (3.5 \u03bcg) and Flag TIRAP (1.5 \u03bcg) were subject to immunoprecipitation analyses followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. TIRAP was shown to immunoprecipitate with both p58 and PACT (FIG. 4C), indicating that PKR and/or its regulators p58 and PACT may be downstream targets of TIRAP. </p>Example 4 The Cell Permeable TIRAP Inhibitory Peptide Inhibits LPS but not CpG Induced NF-\u03baB Activation, PKR Phosphorylation, and JNK Phosphorylation  To further elucidate the function of TIRAP, alternative methods of TIRAP inhibition were sought. The fact that the TIRAP P125H mutant functioned as a dominant negative and could no longer interact with TLR4 indicated that the mutated residue is critical for TIRAP activity, including its ability to interact with the upstream receptor. Therefore, a peptide corresponding t"
