    "ing dissociation constants and half lives were determined by analysis of enzyme progress curves as follows:</p>Proteasome inactivation measurements were obtained by monitoring individual progress curves for the hydrolysis of the site-specific fluorogenic 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (AMC)-labeled peptide substrates (\u03b25, Suc-LLVY-AMC; \u03b22, Z-VLR-AMC, and \u03b21, Z-LLE-AMC) at different inhibitor concentrations. Cleavage of the fluorogenic peptide was continuously monitored as a change in the fluorescence emission at 460 nm (\u03bb<sub>ex</sub>=360 nm) and plotted as a function of time. All assays were performed in cuvettes with 2 mL of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.5 mM EDTA, at 37\u00b10.2\u00b0 C., and with continuous stirring. The concentrations of substrates varied from 10 to 25 \u03bcM (&lt;\u00bd K<sub>M</sub>). The concentration of human 20S proteasome was 0.25 nM and was activated with 0.01% SDS. The rate constant, k<sub>obs</sub>, describing the conversion from the initial velocity to the steady state velocity, were estimated by nonlinear least-squares regression analysis of the individual progress curves using the equation for time-dependent or slow-binding inhibition:</p>F=vs\ue89et+vi-vskobs\ue8a0[1-exp\ue8a0(-kobs\ue89et)]</p>where F is fluorescence, v<sub>i </sub>and v<sub>s </sub>are the initial and steady state velocities of the reaction in the presence of inhibitor, and t is time. A plot of k<sub>obs </sub>as a function of [I] was made to obtain k<sub>on </sub>from the slope of the linear fit of the data. The apparent dissociation constant, K<sup>appi</sup><sub>i</sub>, was determined by nonlinear least-fit of the fractional velocity, v<sub>s</sub>/v<sub>o</sub>, as a function of [I], were v<sub>s </sub>is the steady state value obtained from the time-dependent or slow-binding equation and v<sub>o </sub>is the initial velocity in the absence of inhibitor:</p>vsvo=11+[I]Kiapp</p>The dissociation constant K<sub>i</sub>, was calculated from the apparent Ki using the following expression:</p>Ki=Kiapp1+[S]Km</p>The off rate, k<sub>off</sub>, was mathematically calculated from the above determined parameters using the following relationship:</p>Ki=koffkon</p>The half-life was then determined from the k<sub>off </sub>value using the following relationship:</p>t1/2=ln\ue89e\ue89e2koff</p>Using this protocol, dissociation half-lives were determined for compounds 1, 2, 6, 17, 20, 35, 36, 41, 43, and 45. Compounds 1, 20, 35, 36, 41, 43, and 45, exhibited a t<sub>1/2 </sub>less than 10 min. Compounds 2, 6, and 17 exhibited a t<sub>1/2 </sub>greater than 10 minutes and less than 60 minutes.</p>Example 10Antiproliferation AssayHCT-116 (1000) or other tumor cells in 100 \u03bcL of appropriate cell culture medium (McCoy's 5A for HCT-116, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) are seeded in wells of a 96-well cell culture plate and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0 C. Test compounds are added to the wells and the plates are incubated for 96 hours at 37\u00b0 C. MTT or WST reagent (10 \u03bcL, Roche) are added to each well and incubated for 4 hours at 37\u00b0 C. as described by the manufacturer. For MTT the metabolized dye is solubilized overnight according to manufacturer's instructions (Roche). The optical density for each well is read at 595 nm (primary) and 690 nm (reference) for the MTT and 450 nm for the WST using a spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). For the MTT the reference optical density values are subtracted from the values of the primary wavelength. Percent inhibition is calculated using the values from a DMSO control set to 100%.</p>Example 11In Vivo Tumor Efficacy ModelFreshly dissociated HCT-116 (2-5\u00d710<sup>6</sup>), "
