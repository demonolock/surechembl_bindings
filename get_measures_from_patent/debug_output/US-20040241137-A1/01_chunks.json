    "s have been documented also in a proportion of patients with melanoma or acute myeloid leukemia. </p>[0178] High dose systemic IL2 therapy is also associated with a great number of unwanted toxic side-effects. IL2 has additional effects on other components of the cellular immune system, including B-cells and macrophages, and induces the secretion of other soluble mediators, including TNF-alpha, TNF-beta, and IFN-gamma. These effects may contribute to the antitumor activity of IL2 as well as to its dose-related toxicity. </p>[0179] The transduction of murine tumor cells with a functional IL2 gene has been shown to lead to the rejection of the genetically modified cells by syngeneic hosts. Altered tumor cells expressing IL2 also increase systemic immunity. </p>[0180] Human IL4 is a protein of 129 amino acids (20 kDa) that is synthesized as a precursor containing a hydrophobic secretory signal sequence of 24 amino acids. IL4 is glycosylated at two arginine residues (positions 38 and 105) and contains six cysteine residues involved in disulfide bond formation. The disulfide bonds are essential for biological activity. Some glycosylation variants of IL4 have been described that differ in their biological activities. A comparison of murine and human IL4 shows that both proteins only diverge at positions 91-128. </p>[0181] An IL4 variant, Y124D, in which Tyr124 of the recombinant human protein is substituted by an aspartic acid residue, binds with high affinity to the IL4 receptor (Kd=310 pM). This variant is a powerful antagonist for the IL4 receptor system. It retains no detectable proliferative activity for T-cells and competitively inhibits IL4-dependent T-cell proliferation (K(i)=620 pM). The existence of this mutant demonstrates that high affinity binding and signal generation can be uncoupled efficiently in a ligand. Y124D also acts as a powerful antagonist for the IL13 receptor. </p>[0182] The human IL4 gene contains four exons and has a length of approximately 10 kb. It maps to chromosome 5q23-31. The murine gene maps to chromosome 11. The IL4 gene is in close proximity to other genes encoding hematopoietic growth factors (e.g., GM-CSF, M-CSF, IL3, IL5). The distance between the IL4 and the IL5 gene is approximately 90-240 kb. </p>[0183] At the nucleotide level the human and the murine IL4 gene display approximately 70% homology. The 5\u2032 region of the IL4 contains several sequence elements, designated CLE (conserved lymphokine element), that are binding sites for transcription factors controlling the expression of this and other genes. A sequence motif, called P sequence (CGAAAATTTCC; SEQ ID NO: 1) in the 5\u2032 region of the human IL4 gene (positions \u221279-\u221269) is the binding site for a nuclear factor, called NF(P), mediating the response to T-cell activation signals. </p>[0184] The biological activities of IL4 are mediated by a specific receptor (Kdis=20-100 pM) which is expressed at densities of 100-5000 copies/cell (e.g. polypeptides encoded by Ge"
