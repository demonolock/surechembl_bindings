{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\nAn IL4 variant, Y124D, in which Tyr124 of the recombinant human protein is substituted by an aspartic acid residue, binds with high affinity to the IL4 receptor (Kd=310 pM).\nThis variant is a powerful antagonist for the IL4 receptor system and competitively inhibits IL4-dependent T-cell proliferation (K(i)=620 pM).\nThe biological activities of IL4 are mediated by a specific receptor (Kdis=20-100 pM) which is expressed at densities of 100-5000 copies/cell."}
