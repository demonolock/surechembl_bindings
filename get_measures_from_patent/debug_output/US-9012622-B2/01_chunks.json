    " of the transfection reagent, incubated for 30 min at room temperature, then added drop-wise into the cell culture. Target mRNA and protein levels and effects on cells are analyzed in 48 h.</p>Total RNA will be extracted from cell culture or tumor tissues with RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For RT-PCR, the first cDNA strands will be synthesized by using cDNA Synthesis Kit (GE Healthcare, Chicago, Ill.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR reaction will be started with lower cycle numbers, from 25, 30 to 35 to avoid the possible amplification plateau. Both Geneamp 9700 Thermalcycler and Taqman (ABI, CA) will be used for PCR analysis. The amplicons will be subjected to gel electrophoresis analysis. To demonstrate that the levels of EGFR, Raf-1 and mTOR proteins can be down-regulated by the corresponding siRNAs, the siRNA transfected cancer cells are measured for the levels of EGFR, Raf-1 and mTOR, respectively. ELISA with specific antisera will be used for validation of siRNA-mediated down-regulation targeted proteins according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies against EGFR, Raf-1 and mTOR will be purchased from CalBiochem (San Diego, Calif.), Abcam (Cambridge, Mass.), and R &amp; D (Minneapolis, Minn.), respectively.</p>The cell samples will be collected after Lipo2000 mediated transfection of siRNA duplexes targeting EGFR, Raf-1 and mTOR genes for the TUNEL assay, cell autophagy assay and Ki-67 assay. Coverslips containing either harvested cells will be fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, incubated in 0.1% Triton X-100, then with TUNEL reaction mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Penzberg, Germany) for 1 h at room temperature in darkness to allow incorporation of fluorescein (FITC)-dUTP into DNA fragments. The procedure will be completed accordingly and the slides will be analyzed with a fluorescent microscope (Nikon Eclipse E800). Cell autophagy test will be carried out with collected cells, which will be fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and incubated in 0.1% Triton X-100. After blocked with 5% BSA for 1 hour, the cells will be incubated with a GFP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif.) for 1 hour, then with an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) together with Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin. The coverslips will be sealed and subjected to fluorescent microscopic analysis. Analysis of cell proliferation will be carried out with coverslips containing harvested cells incubated in 0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked with 5% BSA for 1 h, then incubated with a polyclonal antibody ab833 (Abcam, Cambridge, Mass.) against proliferating cell nuclear marker Ki-67, then with Texas Red labeled anti-rabbit antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif.), then sealed, and subjected to fluorescent microscopic analysis.</p>HK polymers were synthesized on a Ranin Voyager synthesizer (PTI, Tucson, Ariz.) as described in Leng et al 2006, Leng et al 2007, and Leng et al, 2008 Three polymers (H3K8b, H3K(+H)4b), H3K(+G)4b) were used as siRNA carriers in this study. H3K8b has 8 terminal branches and a molecular weight of 22 922; H3K(+H)4b and H3K(+G)4b have 4 terminal branches and molecular weights of 10, 191 and 10, 539, respectively. The structures of HK polymers are as follows: R-K(R)-K(R)-K(R) where R=[HHHKHHHKHHHKHHH]<sup>2</sup>KH4NH4] for H3K8b; R=[KHHHKHHHHKHH-HKHHH] for H3K(+H)4b; R=[KHHHKHHHKGHHHKHHHG] for H3K(+G)4b. Nomenclature of HK polymers: 1) for H3K4b, the dominant repeating sequence in its terminal branch is -HHHK-, thus \u201cH3K\u201d is part of the name; the \u201c4b\u201d refers to the number of terminal branches; 2) for H3K(+H)4b, four-branched analog of H3K4b in which 1 extra histidine is inserted in the terminal branch of H3K4b; 3) for H3K(+G)4b, four-branched analog of H3K4b in which 2 glycines are interspersed within the dominant pattern of the terminal branch; 4) for H3K8b, an eight-branched HK polymer with a dominant terminal sequence of -HHHK-. We are going to focus on one particular species of Histidine-Lysine Polymer, H3K4b, denoted as HKP for simplification.</p>H3K4b (300 \u03bcg) in complex with siRNA (75 \u03bcg) (4:1 wt:wt, polymer:"
