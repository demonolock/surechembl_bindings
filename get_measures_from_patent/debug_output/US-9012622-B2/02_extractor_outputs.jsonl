{"raw_mentions": "Here is the extracted sentence:\n\nH3K4b (300 \u03bcg) in complex with siRNA (75 \u03bcg) (4:1 wt:wt, polymer: \n\nNote that this sentence does not contain a bioactivity metric (IC50, Ki, Kd, EC50) or its variation. However, I extracted it as it contains a specific molecule name (H3K4b), a numeric value (300 \u03bcg), and a unit (\u03bcg).\n\nAfter re-reading the text, I found another sentence that contains a specific molecule name, a numeric value, and a unit:\n\nH3K8b has 8 terminal branches and a molecular weight of 22 922; H3K(+H)4b and H3K(+G)4b have 4 terminal branches and molecular weights of 10, 191 and 10, 539, respectively.\n\nThis sentence contains specific molecule names (H3K8b, H3K(+H)4b, H3K(+G)4b), numeric values (22 922, 10 191, 10 539), and a unit ( molecular weight). However, it still does not contain a bioactivity metric.\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn't find any sentence that meets all four criteria. If you'd like, I can try to extract more information or help with anything else."}
