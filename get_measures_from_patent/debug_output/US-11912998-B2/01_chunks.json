    "eotaxin-1 in the circulatory system of the individual is 50% or less, such as 25% or less, including 10% or less, e.g., 1% or less, relative to the amount that was detectable prior to intervention according to the invention, and in some instances the amount is undetectable following intervention.</p><p id=\"p-0038\" num=\"0037\">The eotaxin-1 level may be reduced using any convenient protocol. In some embodiments, the eotaxin-1 level is reduced by administering to the mammal an effective amount of an active system eotaxin-1 reducing agent, i.e., an agent whose administration results in the reduction of active eotaxin-1 (e.g., eotaxin-1 that can bind to CCR3) that is systemically present in the mammal. As such, in practicing methods according to these embodiments of the invention, an effective amount of the active agent, e.g., eotaxin-1 modulatory agent, is provided to the adult mammal.</p><p id=\"p-0039\" num=\"0038\">Depending on the particular embodiments being practiced, a variety of different types of active agents may be employed. In some instances, the agent is an agent that modulates, e.g., inhibits, eotaxin-1 activity by binding to eotaxin-1 and/or inhibiting binding of eotaxin-1 to a receptor therefore, e.g., CCR3. For example, agents that bind to eotaxin-1 and inhibit its activity are of interest. In certain of these embodiments, the administered active agent is an eotaxin-1 specific binding member. In general, useful eotaxin-1 specific binding members exhibit an affinity (Kd) for a target eotaxin-1, such as human eotaxin-1, that is sufficient to provide for the desired reduction in aging associated impairment eotaxin-1 activity. As used herein, the term \u201caffinity\u201d refers to the equilibrium constant for the reversible binding of two agents; \u201caffinity\u201d can be expressed as a dissociation constant (Kd). Affinity can be at least 1-fold greater, at least 2-fold greater, at least 3-fold greater, at least 4-fold greater, at least 5-fold greater, at least 6-fold greater, at least 7-fold greater, at least 8-fold greater, at least 9-fold greater, at least 10-fold greater, at least 20-fold greater, at least 30-fold greater, at least 40-fold greater, at least 50-fold greater, at least 60-fold greater, at least 70-fold greater, at least 80-fold greater, at least 90-fold greater, at least 100-fold greater, or at least 1000-fold greater, or more, than the affinity of an antibody for unrelated amino acid sequences. Affinity of a specific binding member to a target protein can be, for example, from about 100 nanomolar (nM) to about 0.1 nM, from about 100 nM to about 1 picomolar (pM), or from about 100 nM to about 1 femtomolar (fM) or more. The term \u201cbinding\u201d refers to a direct association between two molecules, due to, for example, covalent, electrostatic, hydrophobic, and ionic and/or hydrogen-bond interactions, including interactions such as salt bridges and water bridges. In some embodiments, the antibodies bind human eotaxin-1 with nanomolar affinity or picomolar affinity. In some embodiments, the antibodies bind human eotaxin-1 with a Kd of less than about 100 nM, 50 nM, 20 nM, 20 nM, or 1 nM. In some embodiments, the affinity between the binding member active agent in a binding complex with eotaxin-1 is characterized by a K<sub>d </sub>(dissociation constant) of 10<sup>\u22126 </sup>M or less, such as 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>M or less, including 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M or less, e.g., 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>M or less, 10<sup>\u221210 </sup>M or less, 10<sup>\u221211 </sup>M or less, 10<sup>\u221212 </sup>M or less, 10<sup>\u221213 </sup>M or less, 10<sup>\u221214 </sup>M or less, including 10<sup>\u221215 </sup>M or less.</p><p id=\"p-0040\" num=\"0039\">Examples of eotaxin-1 specific binding members include eotaxin-1 antibodies and binding fragments thereof.
