    "for use as an active therapeutic substance. Compounds of formula (I) are of particular use in the treatment of hypertension.</p>The present invention further provides a method of treating hypertension in mammals including man, which comprises administering to the afflicted mammal an antihypertensive effective amount of a compound or a pharmaceutical composition of the invention.</p>The resolution of compounds of formula (I) into optical isomers may be accomplished by reacting the racemate with an optically pure chiral auxiliary, preferable 1-(1-naphthyl)ethyl isocyanate or \u03b1-methylbenzyl isocyanate, to form a mixture of two diastereomers. These diastereomers are then separated by physical means, such as chromatography or crystallization. Each is reacted to remove the chiral auxiliary to afford the enantiomers of compounds of formula (I).</p>The resolution of compounds of formula (I) into optical isomers may also be accomplished by the resolution process described in Soll et al, AHP-9458, serial number not yet known.</p>The following Examples further illustrate this invention.</p>EXAMPLE 1Preparation of p-Trifluoromethoxy Phenolp-Trifluromethoxy aniline (49.60g) was added rapidly dropwise to vigorously stirred 9N aqueous H<sub>2</sub> SO<sub>4</sub> (500 mL) at 40\u00b0 C. The mixture was heated to dissolve the solid, then cooled to 0\u00b0 C. To the fine white suspension, a solution of sodium nitrite (19.46 g in 50 mL of H<sub>2</sub>) was added portionwise until an immediate positive KI/starch test result was obtained. This cold solution of diazonium salt was added rapidly dropwise to 9N aqueous H<sub>2</sub> SO<sub>4</sub> (500 mL) at 110\u00b0 C. Stirring and heating was continued for 2.5 hours. The mixture was cooled to 10\u00b0 C. and extracted with diethyl ether (3\u00d7500 mL). The combined organic layers were dried (MgSO<sub>4</sub>), filtered and evaporated in vacuo, then flash chromatographed on SiO<sub>2</sub> using diethyl ether as eluant to give 35.0 g of the desired phenol as a light brown oil was distilled (b.p.=75\u00b0-80\u00b0 C. at 20 torr.) to afford a yellow liquid.</p>NMR (CDCl<sub>3</sub>): \u03b45.06 (1H, s), 6.83 (2H, d, J=9.2), 7.11 (2H, d, J=9.2 Hz).</p>EXAMPLE 2Preparation of 1-[(1,1-Dimethyl-2-propynyl)oxy] -4-(trifluoromethoxy)benzeneTo a solution of p-trifluoromethoxy phenol (30.69 g), and 2-methyl-2-chloro-3-butyne (53.00 g) in dry acetonitrile (350 mL) was added potassium iodide (14.30 g) followed by potassium carbonate (95.25 g). This reaction mixture was heated at 70\u00b0-80\u00b0 C. for four days then cooled to room temperature and filtered through celite. The precipitate was washed with dichloromethane and the washing were added to the acetonitrile. The organics were evaporated in vacuo and the oil was taken up in 250 mL of dichloromethane. The organics were washed with water (2\u00d7100 mL) and dilute aqueous sodium thiosulfate (2\u00d7100 mL), dried (MgSO<sub>4</sub>), filtered and evaporated in vacuo to leave a dark brown-orange oil.
