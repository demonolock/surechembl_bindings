The medium is\nchanged one day later, and after 2 days, aliquots of the trypsinized cells are placed in wells\nof a 96 well plate. After five days in culture in the presence of the ligands, the levels of \u03b2-galactosidase\nare measured. The cells are then rinsed and incubated with the substrate, o-nitrophenyl\n\u03b2-D-galactopyranoside. After 16 hours, the plates are read at 405 nm on a\nplate-reader. Each compound is tested for activity in triplicate at seven different\nconcentrations (10, 2.5, 0.625, 0.156, 0.039, 0.0098, and 0.0024 nM).</p>None of the compounds tested show agonist activity at human 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>\nserotonin receptors.
