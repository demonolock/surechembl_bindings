    "le classification to distribute to 0 class, afterwards RNTO 3 classes (Wittenberg etc., J.Biol.Chem.277:871-874,2002).Because based on be that one-level aminoacid sequence is described different classifications, symbiotic hemoglobin and nonsymbiotic hemoglobin may reside in 1 class or 2 classes, 3 classes comprise the oxyphorase of brachymemma.Member in these three classifications not only aminoacid sequence is different, and biochemical characteristic is also different.The oxyphorase of brachymemma is that carry can be in conjunction with the small protein of the heme group of oxygen.1 class and 2 class oxyphorases can make a distinction mutually according to some amino acid whose conservative property in sequence (referring to Hunt etc., 2001,1 class and 2 classes are described in detail in detail).2 class oxyphorases have conservative proline residue at position B3 and G3, and their disappearance can cause the different orientation of B and G spiral in 1 class oxyphorase.In sequence, the extra replacement of some position and electric charge change can cause the further change that these spirals are piled up.</p>Symbiotic hemoglobin be mainly found in fabaceous root nodule and with the non-leguminous plant of bacteria paragenesis in.In plant, known symbiotic hemoglobin works in oxygen transportation, therefore by oxygen being offered to root nodule, stimulates nitrogen to fix.This may be to the high-affinity of oxygen and (Appleby, Sci.Prog.76,365-398,1992) that the quick dissociation constant of oxygen is obtained by leghemoglobin.Leghemoglobin belongs to multigene family, conventionally obtains posttranslational modification.Bacterial hemoglobin from Vitreoscilla (Vitreoscilla.sp.) is similar to leghemoglobin at it aspect the binding characteristic of oxygen, and due to this characteristic, described protein is for promoting plant and microorganism growth (US5,049,493; US5,959,187).The K of Vitreoscilla hemoglobin\n        <sub>d</sub>for 6000nM, and the K of Arabidopis thaliana (Arabidopsis) 2 class oxyphorases\n        <sub>d</sub>for 130nM, low more than 45 times.This high K\n        <sub>d</sub>make Vitreoscilla hemoglobin be very suitable for stimulating oxygen transportation and plant-growth subsequently.Therefore, Vitreoscilla hemoglobin and plant nonsymbiotic hemoglobin are very distinct (Bulow etc., Trends Biotechnol.17,21-24,1999).For promoting plant cell culture medium oxygen to shift and for plant regeneration, the purposes of Vitreoscilla hemoglobin can comparable with the purposes of bovine hemoglobin (Azhakanandam etc., EnzymeMicrob.Technol.21,572-577,1997).\n      </p>On the other hand, on one-level protein structure, nonsymbiotic hemoglobin is different from leghemoglobin (Arredondo-Peter etc., 1998).In addition, non-symbiotic plant oxyphorase has very high affinity to oxygen, and association constant is moderate, and dissociation constant is very low (than symbiotic hemoglobin to the dissociation constant of oxygen low approximately 40 times (Arredondo-Peter etc., 1998; Bulow etc., 1999; Watts etc., Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci USA 98,10119-10124)).Therefore, oxygen is by stably combination, and the effect in oxygen perception or oxygen transportation is unlikely (Arredondo-Peter etc., 1998).Yet the function about nonsymbiotic hemoglobin in plant is known seldom.Their biochemical characteristic be it seems and is not included in the effect in oxygen diffusion, but is possible (Hill, Can.J.Bot.76,707-712,1998) as the effect of oxygenase.The combination of oxygen has caused affecting the conformational change of the ligand molecular being associated, and causes thus specific physiological responses (Goodman and Hargrove, J.Biol.Chem.276,6834-6839,2001).</p>By anoxic, improve sucrose concentration (Trevaskis etc., Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.USA 94,12230-12234,1997) or can induce 1 class oxyphorase by nitrate (Wang etc., Plant Cell 12,1491-1510,2000).Their also (Ross etc., Protopalsma218,125-133,2001) expression in (Hunt etc., 2001) and noble cells in the root of the seed germinateing and maturation plant.1 class nonsymbiotic hemoglobin is induced (Hunt etc., 2001) by Hypoxia Stress.Arabidopsis oxyphorase 1 has improved the survival of Arabidopis thaliana under anoxic is coerced, and has promoted early stage bud and root growth (Hunt etc., Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.USA 99,17197-17202,2002).The purposes that changes 1 class haemoglobin molecule of plant growth characteristics mainly c"
