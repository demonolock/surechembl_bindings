    "ed by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) as follows. CD73 binding kinetics and affinity were studied by surface Plasmon resonance (SPR) using a Biacore T100 instrument (GE Healthcare) at 25\u00b0C. This experiment tested the binding of the N-terminal domain of hCD73 (consisting of residues 26 - 336 of human CD73; termed N-hCD73) to antibodies that were captured on immobilized protein A surfaces. For these experiments, protein A (Pierce) was immobilized to a density of 3000 - 4000 RU on flow cells 1-4 of a CM5 sensor chip (GE Healthcare) using standard ethyl(dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) / N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) chemistry, with ethanolamine blocking, in a running buffer of 0.01 M HEPES pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% v/v tween 20. Kinetic experiments were performed by first capturing antibodies (5-10ug/ml) on the protein A surfaces using a 30 s contact time at 10ul/min, with binding of 600, 200, 66.7, 22.2, 7.4, and 2.5 nM N-hCD73-his, using a 180 s association time and 360 s dissociation time at a flow rate of 30 ul/min. The running buffer for the kinetic experiments was 10 mM sodium phosphate, 130 mM sodium chloride, 0.05% tween 20, pH 7.1. The surfaces were regenerated after each cycle using two 30 s pulses of 10 mM glycine pH 1.5 at a flow rate of 30 \u00b5l/min. Sensogram data was double-referenced and then fitted to a 1:1 Langmuir model using Biacore T100 evaluation software v2.0.4, to determine the association rate constant (ka), the dissociation rate constant (kd), and the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD).</p>The results are shown in Table 8.

High-content internalization assay (2 hour fixed time assay)The anti-CD73 antibodies used to test anti-CD73 antibody dependent CD73 internalization in Calu6 cells by assessing cellular expression after 2 hours of antibody incubation. Cells (2,000 cells/well) in 20 \u00b5l of complete medium (Gibco RPMI Media 1640 with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum) were plated in 384 BD Falcon plate and grown overnight at 37\u00b0C 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 95% humidity. Anti-CD73 antibodies were serially diluted with PBS buffer containing 0.2% BSA, and added 5 \u00b5l/well into the cell plate, The cells were incubated with antibodies for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 95% humidity, followed by washing once with PBS buffer. Formaldehyde (final 4% in PBS) was then added into the cell plate at 20ul/well, and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. Afterwards, all liquid was aspirated and cells were washed once with 30ul PBS. Detection antibody (2.5 \u00b5g/well of anti-CD73 Ab CD73.10.IgG2C219S) was added at 15 \u00b5g/well into the fixed cell plate. The cells were incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight. On the next day, the plate was washed twice with PBS buffer. followed by adding secondary antibody containing Alexa-488 goat anti human and DAPL stained for 1 hour at room temperature. After 3 washes in PBS buffer, the plate was imaged on Arrayscan Vti (Cellomics, Pittsburgh, PA). IC<sub>50</sub> and Ymax were measured. Ymax was determined by comparing to 100nM dose of 11F11 as internal maximum. All calculations were determined as a percentage of internalization compared to this control, which was set to 100%.</p>The results are provided in Table 9.\nTable 9mAbConstant regionEpitope binEC50 (nM)Ymax11F11IgG210.58984D4IgG210.3810410D2IgG11ND2924H2IgG118.2517A11IgG112.5950CD73.4IgG2-C219S-IgG1.111.297CD73.10IgG1.116.1864CD73.10IgG2-C219S10.6799CD73.10IgG2-C219S-IgG1.110.8799ND = Not Detected\nNA = Not Applicable</p>The results show that anti-CD73 antibodies having an IgG2 hinge have a lower EC50 and higher Ymax.</p>Kinetic internalization studies were performed to assess the rate of internalization. Several cells lines were tested: H2228 cells, HCC15 cells, Calu6 cells, and NCI-H2030. Cells (2,000 cells/well) in 20 \u00b5l of complete medium (Gibco RPMI Media 1640 with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum) were plated in 384 BD Falcon plate and grown overnight at 37\u00b0C 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 95% humidity. CD73 antibodies were diluted with PBS buffer containing 0.2% BSA to 10\u00b5g/ml and added 5 \u00b5l/well into the cell plate. The cells were incubated with antibodies for 0-2 hour time course at 37\u00b0C, followed by washing once with PBS buffer. The cells were subsequently fixed with formaldehyde (final 4% in PBS) at room temperature for 10 minutes, and then washed once with 30ul PBS. Detection antibody (2.5 \u00b5g/well anti-CD73 Abs CD73.10.IgG2C219S) were diluted with PBS buffer containing 0.2% BSA, and added 15 \u00b5l/well into the fixed cell plate. The plate was incubated at 4\u00b0C for overnight. On the next day, after 3 washes in PBS buffer, Secondary antibody Alexa488-goat anti human with DAPI were added. The cells were stained for 60 minutes at room temperature, after 3 washes, images were acquired using Arrayscan Vti (Cellomics, Pittsburgh, PA).

    "vations made using the alexa quenching method described above and support a model suggesting the G2 hinge has potential advantage over G1 for inducing GITR internalization.</p>Example 10: GITR agonist Ab signaling in T cell receptor activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is enhanced in antibodies having an IgG2 hinge and CH1 domainTo further investigate the mechanisms for anti-GITR agonist antibodies, several signaling pathways involved in T cell activation, such as NFkB and P38 signaling pathways, were monitored.</p>CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from a healthy donor (M6576) were activated with plate-coated 0.4 \u00b5g/ml anti-CD3 and 0.4\u25a1/ml anti-CD28. After 3 days, cells were collected and plated onto 384-well image plates for signaling activation. After cells settled in the plate for 2 hours, they were treated with GITR antibodies for 15 minutes and the signaling events were terminated by adding formaldehyde to a final of 10% into the assays plate. Then the cells were permeabilized and stained with phosphor-p65 NFKB antibody for signaling detection. As shown in Figure 17, GITR.6.G2 and GITR.6.G2.G1f antibodies had higher signaling responses compared to the GITR.6.G1f in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Although there is no direct evidence of linking internalization and signaling pathway activation, it is intriguing to note that G2 isotype seems to improve both aspects of antibody functional activities compared to the IgG1 for GITR.6.</p>To quantify the signaling activities for each antibody, both EC50 and Emax for each antibody were calculated, since both parameters are critical to capture the full extent of the signaling event. The response level of GITR.6.G2.G1f is chosen to be the 100% control, and all other antibodies were normalized against it. As shown in Table 21 for both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations activated by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies, there were a range of activities for GITR antibodies in terms of both potency (EC50s) and efficacy (Emax%). Although GITR.6.G2, GITR.6.G2.G1f and GITR.6.G1f showed similar potencies (EC50s) around 10nM range, the efficacy (Emax) was quite different for different isotypes, suggesting G1 antibody does not signal as effectively as the G2 or chimeric isotypes.\nTable 21.

As shown in Figure 18, GITR.6.G2 and GITR.6.G2.G1f antibodies had higher signaling responses compared to the GITR.6.G1f antibody in a CD4+ cell p38 MAPK activation assay. Therefore the better signaling activities for GITR.6 G2 isotype compared with G1 isotype is not only limited to NFkB signaling.</p>In addition to enhanced agonist activity and internalization, it was also shown that modified heavy chain constant regions can impart enhanced ADCC (to, e.g., an agonist of a stimulatory receptor), as well as provide a new activity to an antibody. For example, it was found that changing the constant heavy chain domain of an antibody that binds to an inhibitory cell surface molecule and prevents the inhibitory activity of the cell surface molecule (an antagonist) to a modified heavy chain constant region described herein, resulted in the antibody losing its ability to be an antagonist, and instead endowed it with agonist activity (of the inhibitory activity).</p>Example 11: Confirmation of disulfide bonds of IgG2.3 and IgG2.5 constructsThe disulfide bond structures in an antibody comprising the constant domain IgG2.3 (A for"
