    "L can specifically bind to kappa light chains of various animal antibodies, and thus immobilized protein L is often used as a medium for purifying Fab fragments of antibodies.</p>The constructed hGPFab stable expression cell strain, the culture supernatant of which is purified by HiTrap protein L purification column (HiTrap Protein L column) affinity chromatography on an AKTA system, is carried out according to the following description of the operation steps, and the basic steps are as follows:</p> 1. 2 liters of culture supernatant of hGPFab expressing cells was collected and centrifuged at 10000rpm for 30 minutes to remove cell debris. Vacuum filtering with 0.22 \u03bcm filter membrane. </p>2. HiTrap protein L purification column was equilibrated with binding buffer (20mM sodium phosphate,150mM NaCl,pH 7.2) until UV scan and conductivity were stable.</p>3. The sample of step 1 was loaded.</p>4. The HiTrap protein L purification column was washed with binding buffer until uv scan and conductivity were stable and returned to baseline.</p>5. The protein of interest (100 mM glycine-HCl, pH 2.5) was eluted with elution buffer.</p>The purified protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and in the non-reduced state, had a molecular weight of about 45kD, and after DTT treatment with the reducing agent, it became a monomer having a molecular weight of about 25kD, suggesting that the secreted hGPFab protein structure was dimeric and that the molecular weights of both monomers were close (about 25 kD) (FIG. 4) in accordance with the expected results.</p>Example 9: hGPFab and human GPVI protein.</p>In order to analyze the binding characteristics of hGPFab and GPVI in the invention, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method is established to detect the expressed hGPFab protein, and the operation method is a conventional related technology and comprises the following basic steps:</p> 1. Purified GPVI protein is coated on a 96-well microplate, the coating concentration of the GPVI protein is 2 mug/ml, the coating solution is carbonate buffer solution with the pH of 9.6, the coating amount is 100 mu l/well, after overnight at 4 \u2103, the purified GPVI protein is blocked for 2 hours at room temperature by using PBS buffer solution containing 5% nonfat milk powder, and then the microwells are washed for 3 times by using washing liquid containing Tween-20 (Tween-20) for standby. </p>2. 100 \u039cl of the sample to be tested (e.g. hGPFab protein at different dilutions or cell culture supernatant, control, etc.) was added and reacted for 2 hours at room temperature, and the microwells were washed 5 times with wash solution.</p>3. Mu.l of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) -labeled anti-human Fab antibody (1:2000 dilution) was added and reacted at room temperature for 2 hours, and the microwells were washed 5 times with wash solution.</p>4. 100 \u039cl of TMB substrate was added and the reaction was stopped at room temperature for 15 minutes by adding 100 \u03bcl of 2M sulfuric acid.</p>5.
