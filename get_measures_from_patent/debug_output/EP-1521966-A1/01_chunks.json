    "id from said subject relative to a reference value representing a known health status indicates a diagnosis, or prognosis, or increased risk of becoming diseased with a neurodegenerative disease, particularly AD.</p>\n  In preferred embodiments, measurement of the level of transcription products of a rab31 gene is performed in a sample from a subject using a quantitative PCR- analysis with primer combinations to amplify said gene specific sequences from cDNA obtained by reverse transcription of RNA extracted from a sample of a subject. A Northern blot with probes specific for said gene can also be applied. It might further be preferred to measure transcription products by means of chip-based microarray technologies. These techniques are known to those of ordinary skill in the art (see Sambrook and Russell, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 2001 ; Schena M., Microarray Biochip Technology, Eaton Publishing, Natick, MA, 2000). An example of an immunoassay is the detection and measurement of enzyme activity as disclosed and described in the patent application WO 02/14543.</p>\n  Furthermore, a level and/or an activity of a translation product of a rab31 gene and/or of a fragment, or derivative, or variant of said translation product, and/or a level of activity of said translation product, and/or of a fragment, or derivative, or variant thereof, can be detected using an immunoassay, an activity assay, and/or a binding assay. These assays can measure the amount of binding between said protein molecule and an anti-protein antibody by the use of enzymatic, chromodynamic, radioactive, magnetic, or luminescent labels which are attached to either the anti-protein antibody or a secondary antibody which binds the anti-protein antibody. In addition, other high affinity ligands may be used. Immunoassays which can be used include e.g. ELISAs, Western blots, and other techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art (see Harlow and Lane, Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 1999 and Edwards R, Immunodiagnostics: A Practical Approach, Oxford University Press, Oxford; England, 1999). All these detection techniques may also be employed in the format of microarrays, protein-arrays, antibody microarrays, \n\ntissue microarrays, electronic biochip or protein-chip based technologies (see Schena M., Microarray Biochip Technology, Eaton Publishing, Natick, MA, 2000).</p>\n  In a preferred embodiment, the level, or the activity, or both said level and said activity of (i) a transcription product of a gene coding for rab31 , and/or of (ii) a translation product of a gene coding for rab31 , and/or of (iii) a fragment, or derivative, or variant of said transcription or translation product in a series of samples taken from said subject over a period of time is compared, in order to monitor the progression of said disease.

    "and said compound or plurality of compounds, and said detectable, preferably fluorescently labelled ligand, and (v) measuring the amounts of preferably fluorescence associated with said rab31 translation product, or with said fragment, or derivative, or variant thereof, and (vi) determining the degree of inhibition by one or more of said compounds of binding of said ligand to said rab31 translation product, or said fragment, or derivative, or variant thereof. It might be preferred to reconstitute said rab31 translation product, or fragment, or derivative, or variant thereof into artificial liposomes to generate the corresponding proteoliposomes to determine the inhibition of binding between a ligand and said rab31 translation product. Methods of reconstitution of rab31 translation products from detergent into liposomes have been detailed (Schwarz et al., Biochemistry 1999, 38: 9456-9464; Krivosheev and Usanov, Biochemistry-Moscow 1997, 62: 1064-1073). Instead of utilizing a fluorescently labelled ligand, it might in some aspects be preferred to use any other detectable label known to the person skilled in the art, e.g. radioactive labels, and detect it accordingly. Said method may be useful for the identification of novel compounds as well as for evaluating compounds which have been improved or otherwise optimized in their ability to inhibit the binding of a ligand to an rab31 translation product, or a fragment, or derivative, or variant thereof. One example of a fluorescent binding assay, in this case based on the use of carrier particles, is disclosed and described in patent application WO 00/52451. A further example is the competitive assay method as described in patent WO 02/01226. Preferred signal detection methods for screening assays of the instant invention are described in the following patent applications: WO 96/13744, WO 98/16814, WO 98/23942, WO 99/17086, WO 99/34195, WO 00/66985, WO 01/59436, WO 01/59416. \n\nIn one further embodiment, the present invention provides a method for producing a medicament comprising the steps of (i) identifying a compound as an inhibitor of binding between a ligand and a gene product of the gene coding for rab31 by the aforementioned inhibitory binding assay and (ii) admixing the compound with a pharmaceutical carrier. However, said compound may also be identifiable by other types of screening assays.</p>\n  In another aspect, the invention features an assay for testing a compound, preferably for screening a plurality of compounds to determine the degree of binding of said compounds to a translation product of the gene coding for rab31 , or to a fragment, or derivative, or variant thereof. Said screening assay comprises (i) adding a liquid suspension of said rab31 translation product, or a fragment, or derivative, or variant thereof, to a plurality of containers, and (ii) adding a detectable, preferably a fluorescently labelled compound or detectable, preferably a plurality of fluorescently labelled compounds to be screened for said binding to said plurality of containers, and (iii) incubating said rab31 translation product, or said fragment, or derivative, or variant thereof, and said detectable, preferably fluorescently labelled compound or said detectable, preferably fluorescently labelled compounds, and (iv) measuring the amounts of preferably fluorescence associated with said rab31 translation product, or with said fragment, or derivative, or variant thereof, and (v) determining the degree of binding by one or more of said compounds to said rab31 translation product, or said fragment, or derivative, or variant thereof. In this type of assay it might be preferred to use a fluorescent label. However, any other typ"
