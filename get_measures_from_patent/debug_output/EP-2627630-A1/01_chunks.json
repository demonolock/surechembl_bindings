In one embodiment of the invention, compounds of the invention can be prepared by deprotecting a compound of formula II: </p></p>where X, Y, R<sup>1</sup>, R<sup>2</sup>, R<sup>3</sup>, R<sup>4</sup>, and n are as defined for formula I, and P represents an amino- protecting group, to provide a compound of formula I, or a salt thereof. In one particular embodiment, such unprotected compounds have the formulas e, e', f, f , g, g', h, or h'. </p> Further details regarding specific reaction conditions and other procedures for preparing representative compounds of the invention or intermediates thereof are described in the Examples set forth herein. </p> UTILITY </p> Compounds of the invention possess serotonin reuptake inhibitory activity, and in one embodiment, at nanomolar potencies. Thus, these compounds have therapeutic utility as serotonin reuptake inhibitors. In one embodiment, the compounds of the invention act primarily as serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and thus exhibit only minimal or sub-therapeutic \n\n activity as norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and/or dopamine reuptake inhibitors. </p> The inhibition constant (\u00be) of a compound is the concentration of ligand in a radioligand binding inhibition assay that would occupy 50% of the transporters if no radioligand were present. \u00be values can be determined from radioligand binding studies with <sup>3</sup>H-citalopram as described in Assay 1. These Kj values are derived from IC<sub>50</sub> values in the binding assay using the Cheng-Prusoff equation and the \u00be of the radioligand (Cheng &amp; Prusoff (1973) Biochem. Pharmacol. 22(23):3099-3108). Functional IC50 values can be determined in the functional inhibition of uptake assays described in Assay 2. </p>These IC<sub>50</sub> values can be converted to \u00be values using the Cheng-Prusoff equation and the K<sub>m</sub> of the transmitter for the transporter. It is noted however, that the uptake assay conditions described in Assay 2 are such that the IC5<sub>0</sub> values are very close to the \u00be values, should a mathematical conversion be desired, since the 5-HT concentration used in the assay is well below its K<sub>m</sub> for the transporter. </p> One measure of the affinity of a compound for SERT is the inhibitory constant (p i) for binding to the transporter. The p\u00be value is the negative logarithm to base 10 of the Ki. Compounds of the invention of particular interest are those having a p\u00be at SERT greater than or equal to 5.0, particularly those having a pIQ at SERT greater than or equal to 7.0, and even more particularly those having a p\u00be at SERT greater than or equal to 8.0. Another measure of serotonin reuptake inhibition is the pICso value. In one embodiment, compounds of interest are those having a serotonin reuptake inhibition pICso value greater than or equal to 5.0, particularly those having a pICso value greater than or equal to 7.0, and even more particularly those having a pICso value greater than or equal to 8.0. Such values can be determined by techniques that are well known in the art, as well as in the assays described herein. </p> It is noted that in some cases, compounds of the invention may possess weak serotonin reuptake inhibitory activity. In such cases, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that those compounds still have utility as research tools. </p> Exemplary assays to determine the serotonin reuptake inhibiting activity of compounds of the invention include by way of illustration and not limitation, assays that measure SERT binding, for example, as described in Assay 1 and in Tsuruda et al. (2010) Journal of Pharmacological and Toxicological Methods 61(2): 192-204. Useful secondary assays include neurotransmitter uptake assays to measure inhibition of serotonin uptake into cells expressing the human or rat recombinant transporter as described in As",

When cultures reached 80% confluence, the cells were washed thoroughly in PBS (without Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>) and lifted with 5 mM EDTA in PBS. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.5 containing 1 mM EDTA), homogenized, pelleted by centrifugation, and then resuspended in 50mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 and 10% sucrose at 4\u00b0C. Protein concentration of the membrane suspension was determined using a Bio-Rad Bradford Protein Assay kit. Membranes were snap frozen and stored at -80\u00b0C. </p> Binding Assay </p> Binding assays were performed in a 96-well assay plate in a total volume of 200 \u03bc\u0390 assay buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, 120mM NaCl, 5 mM KC1, pH 7.4) with 0.5-1 \u03bcg membrane protein. Saturation binding studies, to determine radioligand \u00be values for <sup>3</sup>H- citalopram were conducted using 12 different radioligand concentrations ranging from 0.005-10 nM.

Neurotransmitter Transporter Uptake Assay dye (0.5 \u03bc\u039c), and eleven different concentrations of compound ranging from 10 pM to 100 \u03bc\u039c was used. Non-specific uptake was determined in the presence of indatraline (2.5 \u03bc\u039c).

For determination of inhibitory potency, a 10-30 minute endpoint substrate accumulation was determined by fluorescence \n\n spectroscopy using a Safire (Tecan Group Ltd., Mannendorf, Switzerland) and analysis was performed as described in Tsuruda et al, supra. For real-time measurements, compounds were either preincubated (as above) or mixed with substrate prior to addition, and kinetic measurements, relative fluorescence units (RFU integrated over 0.5 ms),were made using a cycle time of 1 min. </p> Compounds of the invention that were tested in this assay were found to have serotonin reuptake inhibition pICso values as follows: </p></p>Assay 3 </p> Ex Vivo SERT Radioligand Binding Assay </p> Ex vivo radioligand binding assays are used to determine the in vivo occupancy of SERT, in selected brain regions, following in vivo administration (acute or chronic) of test compounds. Following administration of test compound (by intravenous, intraperitoneal, oral, subcutaneous or other route) at the appropriate dose (0.0001 to 100 mg/kg), rats (&gt; n=4 per group) are euthanized at specific time points (10 minutes to 48 hours) by decapitation and the brain dissected on ice. Relevant brain regions are dissected, frozen, and stored at -80\u00b0C until use. \n\n For the ex vivo radioligand binding assay, the initial rate of association of the SERT selective radioligand (<sup>3</sup>H-citalopram) with rat brain crude homogenates, prepared from vehicle and test compound-treated animals, is monitored (see Hess et al. (2004) J. </p>Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 310(2):488-497). Crude brain tissue homogenates are prepared by homogenizing frozen tissue pieces in 0.15 ml (per mg wet weight) of 50 mM Tris-HCl, 120 mM NaCl, 5mM KCl, pH 7.4 buffer. Radioligand association assays are performed in a 96-well assay plate in a total volume of 200 \u03bc\u0390 assay buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, 120mM NaCl, 5mM KCl, 0.025% BSA, pH 7.4) with 650 \u03bcg wet weight tissue (equivalent to 25 \u03bcg protein). Homogenates are incubated for up to 5 minutes with <sup>3</sup>H-citalopram (3 nM) prior to termination of the assay by rapid filtration over a 96-well UniFilter GF/B plate, pretreated with 0.3% polyethyleneimine. Filters are then washed 6 times with 300 \u03bc\u0390 wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4 at 4\u00b0C). Non-specific radioligand binding is determined in the presence of 1 \u03bc\u039c duloxetine. The plates are dried overnight at room temperature, ~ 45 \u03bc\u0390 of MicroScint\u2122-20 (Perkin Elmer) added and bound radioactivity quantitated via liquid scintillation spectroscopy. The initial rate of association of <sup>3</sup>H- citalopram is determined by linear regression using GraphPad Prism Software package (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA).
