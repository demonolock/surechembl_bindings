    "sis of A\u03b2 Profile: A\u03b2 profile in conditioned media was determined using surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI) mass spectrometry. Conditioned media was incubated with antibody W02 coated PS20 ProteinChip array. Mass spectra of A\u03b2 captured on the array were read on SELDI ProteinChip Reader (Bio-Rad) according to manufacture's instructions. \n\n CSF A\u03b2 Analysis: A\u03b2 in rat CSF was determined using MSD technology as described above. A\u03b240 was measured using antibody pair Tag-G2-10 and biotin- 4G8, while A\u03b242 was measured using Tag-anti A\u03b242 (Meso Scale Discovery) and biotin-4G8. The ECL signal was measured using Sector Imager 2400 (Meso Scale Discovery).</p>Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometric (MALDI MS) analysis of A\u03b2 is performed on a Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometer (ABI, Framingham, MA). The instrument is equipped with a pulsed nitrogen laser (337 nm). Mass spectra are acquired in the linear mode with an acceleration voltage of 20 kV. Each spectrum presented in this work represents an average of 256 laser shots. To prepare the sample-matrix solution, 1 /i. of immunoprecipitated A\u03b2 sample is mixed with 3 \u03bcL of saturated \u03b1-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid solution in 0.1 % TFA/acetonitrile. The sample-matrix solution is then applied to the sample plate and dried at ambient temperature prior to mass spectrometric analysis. All the spectra are externally calibrated with a mixture of bovine insulin and ACTH (18-39 clip).</p>Compound G4 had an Ab42 IC50 of 1114 nM with an Abtotal/Ab42 selectivity of 11 fold.</p>While the present invention has been described with in conjunction with the specific embodiments set forth above, many alternatives, modifications and other variations thereof will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. All such alternatives, modifications and variations are intended to fall within the spirit and scope of the present invention. \n</p>"
