    "nyl acetate hydrochloride (Compound No.21)To a solution of compound of Example 19 (0.2 gm) in diethyl ether (5 ml) at room temperature was added a ethereal hydrochloric acid (5 ml, 20 %). The reaction mixture was stirred for half an hour and then filtered. The residue obtained was dried to afford the title compound (mp 152 - 155\u00b0C).\n<sup>1</sup>H-NMR (DMSO-d<sub>6</sub>) \u03b4 - values :7.57 - 7.26 (m, 5H), 5.85 (s, 1H), 4.84 (s, 2H), 4.11 (s, 2H), 3.19 - 2.82 (m, 4H), 1.7 1-1.16 (m, 11H), 0.6 (m, 1H), 0.5 (m, 1H).\nIR (KBr) : 1749 cm<sup>-1</sup></p>Pharmacological Testing ResultsRadioligand Binding Assays:The affinity of test compounds for M<sub>2</sub> and M<sub>3</sub> muscarinic receptor subtypes was determined by [<sup>3</sup>H]-N-methylscopolamine binding studies using rat heart and submandibular gland respectively as described by Moriya et al., (Life Sci,-1999,64(25):2351) with minor modifications.</p>Membrane preparation : Submandibular glands and heart were isolated and placed in ice cold homogenising buffer (HEPES 20mM, 10mM EDTA, pH 7.4) immediately after sacrifice. The tissues were homogenised in 10 volumes of homogenising buffer and the homogenate was filtered through two layers of wet gauze and filtrate was centrifuged at 500g for 10min. The supernatant was subsequently centrifuged at 40,000g for 20 min. The pellet thus obtained was resuspended in same volume of assay buffer (HEPES 20 mM, EDTA 5mM, pH 7.4) and were stored at -700C until the time of assay.</p>Ligand binding assay: The compounds were dissolved and diluted in DMSO. The membrane homogenates (150-250 \u00b5g protein) were incubated in 250 \u00b5l of assay buffer (HEPES 20 mM, pH 7.4) at 24-25\u00b0C for 3 hours. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 1 \u00b5M atropine. The incubation was terminated by vacuum filtration over GF/B fiber filters(Wallac). The filters were then washed with ice cold 50mM Tris HCl buffer (pH 7.4). The filter mats were dried and bound radioactivity retained on filters was counted. The IC<sub>50</sub> &amp; Kd were estimated by using the non-linear curve fitting program using G Pad Prism software. The value of inhibition constant Ki was calculated from competitive binding studies by using Cheng &amp; Prusoff equation (Biochem Pharmacol, 1973; 22: 3099), Ki = IC<sub>50</sub> /(1+L/Kd), where L is the concentration of [<sup>3</sup>H]NMS used in the particular experiment.</p>Functional Experiments using isolated rat bladder:Methodology:Animals were euthanized by overdose of urethane and whole bladder was isolated and removed rapidly and placed in ice cold Tyrode buffer with the following composition (mMol/L) NaCl 137; KCl 2.7; CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1.8; MgCl<sub>2</sub> 0.1; NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 11.9; NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 0.4; Glucose 5.55 and continuously gassed with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5 % CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>The bladder was cut into longitudinal strips (3mm wide and 5-6 mm long) and mounted in 10 ml organ baths at 30\u00b0 C, with one end connected to the base of the tissue holder and the other end connected to a polygraph through a force displacement transducer. Each tissue was maintained at a constant basal tension of 2 g and allowed to equilibrate for 1 hour during which the PSS was changed every 15 min. At the end of equilibration period the stabilization of the tissue contractile response was assessed with 1\u00b5Mol/L of Carbachol consecutively for 2-3 times. Subsequently a cumulative concentration response curve to carbachol (10<sup>-9</sup> mol/L to 3 X 10<sup>-5</sup> mol/L) was obtained. After several washes, once the baseline was achieved, cumulative concentration response curve was obtained in presence of NCE (NCE added 20 min. prior to the second CRC).</p>The contractile results were expressed as % of control E max. ED50 values were calculated by",
    " warm (37\u00b0C) saline. Both the ureters were ligated and cut proximally to drain the urine coming from kidneys. A stabilization period of 30-60 was allowed for stabilization of parameters from surgical procedures.</p>Salivary response was assessed by measuring the weight of a preweighted cotton gauze kept for 2 minutes in the buccal cavity immediately after the carbachol challenge.</p>At the end of stabilization period 2 control responses to carbachol (1.5)\u00b5g/kg intra-arterial) on bladder pressure and salivation were obtained and this response was considered as 100%. Subsequently, the effect of increasing dose of NCE (ranging from 3 \u00b5g/kg to 1mg/kg) or vehicle (i.v., 15 min before carbachol challenge) was examined.</p>The change in bladder pressure and salivation were expressed as % change from pretreatment control averages. The ID<sub>50</sub> values for salivation and bladder pressure inhibition were calculated using Graph Pad Prism software, by fitting the values at dose into non-linear regression curve. Oxybutynin and Tolterodine were used as standards for comparison.</p>The bladder selectivity to salivation was calculated by using following formula and expressed as fold of selectivity of oxybutinin in the same model.
