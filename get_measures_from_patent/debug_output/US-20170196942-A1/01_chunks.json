    "s than 2 \u03bcm. D50 is the maximum particle diameter below which 50 vol % of the sample, based on the total volume of the sample, has a smaller particle diameter and above which 50 vol % of the sample has a larger particle diameter.</p>Example 2. Batch Process for Preparation of Inhalable Insulin Particles in a 90 Vol % Methanol Solution1 gram of biosynthetic human insulin API powder (i.e., recombinant insulin from Amphastar France Pharmaceuticals S.A.S.) was dissolved in 110 ml of an acidic solution having a pH of about 1.9 in a mixture of 90 vol % of methanol and 10 vol % water, in a 400 ml beaker with a centrifugal stirrer or stirring bar. The resultant solution was stirred until the insulin solution was completely dissolved or substantially completely clear to form insulin true solution. Then, the stirring was slowed to a slower mode (e.g., a spinning speed of about 50 rpm), and 25 ml of a 0.1 M sodium acetate/Acetic Acid (NaAc/HAc) buffer solution (having a pH of 5.64) was added dropwise to titrate the dissolved insulin solution. The clear dissolved insulin solution turned into a milky and yellowish suspension including micronized insulin particles. After the titration was completed, about 135 ml of ethanol (Neutral ethanol) was added to the suspension, and the stirring was continued for another 30 minutes for stabilizing the particles and higher yield.</p>The micronized insulin particles were concentrated from the supernatant of the suspension, by ultrafiltration with 500 kD modified polyethersulfone membrane from Spectrum Lab at Rancho Dominguez, Calif. First the mixture was concentrated 5-10 ml, which was washed with 100 ml ethanol three times to remove methanol and salt. The final volume of the suspension is 5 to 10 ml. The concentrated suspension was vacuum dried at room temperature for 2.5 hr. The product weight was used to calculate the recovery rate. The particle size was analyzed using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer (i.e., the JEOL CarryScope JCM-5700 SEM instrument).</p>The above procedures were repeated four (4) times for batches of micronized insulin.</p>Table 1 shows reproducibility of the recovery rate for the four (4) batches produced as described with respect to Example 2. As can be seen from Table 1, the recovery rate for Example 2 is over 86%.</p>TABLE 1Process ReproducibilityBatch No.Recovery Rate %Batch 186.4Batch 286.1Batch 386.8Batch 486.2Average86.4Standard Deviation0.3Relative Standard Deviation, %0.4%</p>Table 2 shows the reproducibility of the particle size distribution of the micronized human insulin particles produced in the batches of Example 2. It was concluded from Table 2 that the particles sizes of the micronized insulin prepared as described with respect to Example 2 are suitable for pulmonary delivery, e.g., having a particle size &lt;5 \u03bcm. For example, as can be seen in Table 2, for the micronized insulin of Example 2 the average particle size D50 was 1.54 \u03bcm, the average particle size D10 was 0.7",
    ".92 gram of micronized insulin was obtained. The recovery rate of Insulin with this process is 92% (e.g., the yield of the insulin particles was 92% by weight based on the total weight of the final product).</p>Example 15. Insulin Micronization Process Compatible with MDI Formulation and CompoundingOne (1) gram of biosynthetic human insulin API powder (i.e., recombinant insulin from Amphastar France Pharmaceuticals S.A.S.) was dissolved in 110 ml of an acidic solution having a pH of about 1.9 in a mixture of 90% by volume of methanol and 10% by volume of water in a 400 ml beaker with a centrifugal stirrer or stirring bar. The resultant solution was stirred until the insulin solution was completely dissolved or substantially completely clear to form insulin true solution. Then, the stirring was slowed to a slower mode (e.g., a spinning speed of about 50 rpm), and 25 ml of a 0.1 M NaAc/HAc buffer solution (having a pH of 5.64) was added dropwise to titrate the dissolved insulin solution. The clear dissolved insulin solution turned into a milky and yellowish suspension including micronized insulin particles. After the titration was completed, about 135 ml of ethanol at 2-8\u00b0 C. was added to the suspension. The stirring was continued for another 30 minutes at a temperature of 2-8\u00b0 C. for stabilizing the particle size and resulting in a higher yield before wash.</p>The micronized insulin particles were concentrated from the supernatant of the suspension by ultrafiltration with 500 kD modified polyethersulfone membrane from Spectrum Lab at Rancho Dominguez, Calif. The suspension of insulin particles was concentrated to 5-10 ml, which was washed with 100 ml ethanol three times to remove impurities, like methanol and salt.</p>The metered dose inhaler, or MDI product (a pulmonary product) is readily processed and compounded with the obtained insulin particles.</p>Comparative Example 1. Preparation of Human Insulin Particles Via Jet MillingHuman Insulin particles were prepared by jet milling utilizing a grinding N<sub>2 </sub>pressure of 75 PSI and a feeding rate about 1 g/min. FIG. 16 is an atomic force microscopy (AFM) image of human insulin particles that were micronized using the jet milling method. As can be seen in the image of FIG. 16, the human insulin particles prepared by jet milling have a rough and irregular (or uneven) appearance.</p>FIG. 17 is an AFM image of inhalable human insulin particles micronized as described with respect to Example 2. Since embodiments of the process disclosed herein are carried out at room temperature and involve no mechanical forces and/or heat (or substantially no mechanical forces and/or heat), the micronized human insulin particles have a shape and surface that are more suitable or more preferred for human pulmonary delivery.</p>According to an embodiment, a high-purity inhalable insulin material for a pulmonary pharmaceutical product, includes: insulin particles having a particle size at the micrometer level, and"
