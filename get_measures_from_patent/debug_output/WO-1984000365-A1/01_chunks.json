    "de terminal groups) produced inhibition of the chymo tryptic hydrolysis of glutaryl-Phe 7 N Mec approaching that of chymostatin. Of the other synthetic peptides tested, the tri peptide semicarbazones of the invention and the dipeptides Z.Leu.Phe aldehyde inhibited the hydrolysis, but only at a far higher concentration. The other semicarbazones, lacking the Arg. residue, had no inhibitory effect on chymotrypsin and when added in a high enough concentration actually increased the rate of hydrolysis.</p><img id=\"imgf000018_0001\" path=\"imgf000018_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/171525464/WO/19840202/A1/001984/00/03/65/imgf000018_0001.tif\"/><img id=\"imgf000019_0001\" path=\"imgf000019_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/171525465/WO/19840202/A1/001984/00/03/65/imgf000019_0001.tif\"/>\n a no inhibition observed at inhibitor concentrations of 50 micromolar) + semicarbazones of the Invention * aldehydes of the invention</p>More detailed results for the comparison of Z.Arg.Leu.Phe(al) with chymotrypsin are shown in Figure 1 of the drawings. (2) Proflavin Displacement Assay</p>The addition of chymotrypsin to free solution proflavin has a quenching affect on the fluorescence of the proflavin. The degree of quenching is dependent on the concentration of chymotrypsin and will reach saturation. For the concentration of proflavin used here, the concentration at which quenching by chymotrypsin reaches saturation is around 200 micromolar. The binding constant is about 35.1 micromolar of chymotrypsin. The fluorescence of proflavin having been decreased by its binding to the added chymotrypsin, it may be increased again by the addition of inhibitors that, in binding to chymotrypsin, displace the proflavin.</p>A series of three fluorimetric cuvettes were prepared each containing 2 ml of 0.01 micromole proflavin in 0.05 M HEPES/ 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> buffer, pH 8.0 (stored in the total absence of light). In addition:-</p>(a) contained 0.2 ml of 1 mM HCl.</p>(b) contained 0.2 ml of chymotrypsin solution (about 13 micromolar) In 1 mM HCl, and aliquots of a solution of test peptide in varied concentrations in DMSO. (c) contained 0.2 ml of chymotrypsin solution (about 13 micromolar) in 1 mM HCl, and aliquots of DMSO only. \n\n The level of fluorescence was recorded at an excitation wavelength of 445 nm and an emission wavelength of 504 nm for each concentration of test peptide.</p>The level of fluorescence of a solution of proflavin and chymotrypsin in the presence of increasing concentrations of test peptide was recorded. The percentage displacement of proflavin was then calculated for each concentration of test peptide using the following equation:-</p><img id=\"imgf000020_0001\" path=\"imgf000020_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/171525466/WO/19840202/A1/001984/00/03/65/imgf000020_0001.tif\"/></p>The percentage displacement of proflavin was plotted versus the concentration of test peptide.</p>Res"
