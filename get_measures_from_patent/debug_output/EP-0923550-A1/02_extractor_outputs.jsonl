Subramanian et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 200 (1994) 1512-1520], they exhibit IC<sub>50</sub> values from about 1 nM.\nIn addition, they are effective, for example, in vivo in the NK1 bronchospasm test in guinea pigs with ED50 values of about 0.05-1 mg/kg p.o., the test compounds being given 2, 4, 12 or 24 hours prior to the intravenous administration of 3.0 \u03bcg/kg of [Sar9,Met(O2)11]-substance P [ = SarSP]."}
