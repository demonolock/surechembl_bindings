    "substance P (NK1 receptor) and neurokinin A [ = NKA] (NK2 receptor).</p>\n  The respiratory tract is equipped with sensory nerves that contain a number of neuropeptides, especially tachykinins and CGRP ( = calcitonin gene-related peptide). The activation of the sensory nerves results in a local release of neuropeptides inside the lungs. More especially substance P and neurokinin A are produced, which trigger an acute inflammatory \n\nreaction termed neurogenic inflammation. That inflammatory reaction proceeds mainly via NK1 receptor activation and includes especially vasodilatation, microvascular leakage, recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes and excessive secretion of mucus, and also bronchoconstriction [mainly via activation of the neurokinin 2 receptor (NK2 receptor)]. Those tachykinin effects are typical features of asthma.</p>\n  The pharmacological action of the compounds of formula I is based especially on the antagonisation of the NK1 receptor and additionally generally also on the antagonisation of the NK2 receptor. The compounds of formula I are therefore capable of inhibiting neurogenic inflammation and tachykinin-induced bronchoconstriction.</p>\n  The advantageous effects of the compounds of formula I can be demonstrated by various in vitro or in vivo test methods. For example, in vitro they inhibit the [beta-Ala8]NKA(4-10)- induced Ca<sup>2*</sup> influx into ovarian cells of transfected Chinese hamsters, which express recombinant human neurokinin 2 receptors, with IC50 values from about 10 nM. Furthermore, in an NK-2 binding assay, in which they are tested for their ability to inhibit the binding of <sup>125</sup>I-NKA to hrNK2CHO cells [culture conditions and cell isolation for hrNK2CHO cells, see N. Subramanian et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 200 (1994) 1512-1520], they exhibit IC<sub>50</sub> values from about 1 nM. In addition, they are effective, for example, in vivo in the NK1 bronchospasm test in guinea pigs with ED50 values of about 0.05-1 mg/kg p.o., the test compounds being given 2, 4, 12 or 24 hours prior to the intravenous administration of 3.0 \u03bcg/kg of [Sar9,Met(O2)11]-substance P [ = SarSP]. The challenge by SarSP induces an increase in intratracheal pressure in the guinea pigs. Furthermore, some of the compounds of formula I are effective p.o. also in the in vivo K2 bronchospasm test in guinea pigs. In that case the increase in intratracheal pressure is induced by intravenous administration of 0.8 \u03bcg kg of [beta-Ala8]NKA(4-10), the test compounds being administered, for example, 2 hours prior to the challenge.</p>\n  The compounds of formula I are effective especially as antagonists of NK1 receptors. Their action on that class of receptors and their action on related receptor systems, for example NK2, render the compounds of formula I therapeutically useful in the prevention, the treatment or the diagnosis of a number of diseases, for example diseases of the upper and lower respiratory tract, for example bronchial asthma, allergic asthma, non-allergic asthma, \n\nallergic"
