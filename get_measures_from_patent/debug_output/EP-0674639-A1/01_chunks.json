    " carbon atoms, more preferably from one to six carbon atoms and derived by the removal of a single hydrogen atom from a straight or branched chain saturated hydrocarbon. Representative of such radicals are methyl, ethyl, n- propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, isobutyl, tert- butyl, n-octyl, 2,4-dimethylpentyl and the like.</p>\n  The term \"alkoxy\" as used herein means an alkyl radical, as defined above having one or more oxygen atoms attached thereto. Representative alkoxy groups include methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, tert-butoxy and the like.</p>\n  The term \"halogen\" as used herein means a fluoro, chloro, bromo or iodo radical. The term \"amino\" as used herein is represented by the radical -NR<sub>8</sub>R<sub>9</sub> wherein R<sub>8</sub> and R<sub>9</sub> are independently hydrogen or an alkyl group as previously described.</p>\n  The term \"acylamino\" as used herein is represented</p>\n  0 || by the radical R<sub>10</sub>-C-NH- wherein R<sub>10</sub> is an alkyl group as described above.</p>\n  The term \"aminosulfone\" as used herein is represented by the radical R<sub>11</sub>-S0<sub>2</sub>-NH- wherein R<sub>1:L</sub> is an alkyl group as defined above. \n\n The term \"ammocarbonyl\" as used herein is</p>\n  O</p>\n  II represented by the radical NH<sub>2</sub>-C- . The compounds herein exhibit 5-HT<sub>4</sub> agonism or antagonism and/or 5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonism. The 5-HT<sub>3</sub> activity possessed by the compounds of this invention was determined by the radioligand receptor binding assay as described herein. 5-HT<sub>4</sub> agonist activity was determined in the in vitro rat tunica muscularis mucosae (TMM) assay described herein. (Baxter et al., Naunyn Schmied Arch. Pharmacol, 1991, 343, 439). Similarly, use of the rat TMM assay may be employed to identify 5-HT<sub>4</sub> antagonists which block the action of serotonin. One with skill in the art could determine the activity of the compounds of the present invention using the methodology of these assays, described herein, without undue experimentation.</p>\n  The compounds of the invention having X=NH and the phthali idines exhibit 5-HT<sub>4</sub> agonist activity which is associated with the planar conformation of the molecules. The benzamide compounds are forced into a planar conformation via internal hydrogen bonding. The other compounds of the invention exhibit 5-HT<sub>4</sub> activity which on a continuum can be antagonist activity or a mixed or partial agonist/antagonist activity.</p>\n  By virtue of their activity as 5-HT<sub>4</sub> agonists or antagonists and/or 5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonists the compounds of Formula I and II are useful in treating conditions such as gastrointestinal motility disorders, emesis, anxiety, cognitive disorders and other CNS disorders. As used herein gastrointestinal motility disorders responsive to treatment with 5-HT<sub>4</sub> agonists include reflux esophagitis, non-ulcer dyspepsia, gastroparesis, ileus, irritable bowel syndrome (constipation predominant",
    " a tissue bath containing oxygenated Tyrode's solution at 37\u00b0 C. Cortisterone acetate (30 \u03bcM) and fluoxetine (1 \u03bcM) were included in the buffer to prevent uptake of serotonin, as well as pargyline (10 \u03bcM) to inhibit monoamine oxidase. Following a 30 min equilibrium period, tissues were isometrically contracted with carbachol (3 \u03bcM) to obtain a tonic contraction. A stable plateau was obtained within 20 min when test compound was added cumulatively to relax the muscle strip. EC<sub>50</sub> values were obtained for each agonist in tissues from 5 rats. EC<sub>50</sub> values for agonists at this 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor are indicated in Table I.</p>\n  TABLE I</p>\n  \n    \n  </p>\n  Additional Rat TMM assays (n=6) were performed for Examples 3 and 4 and the EC<sub>50</sub> results for Example 3 is \n\n269 nM \u00b1 66.7 nM and for Example 4 is 347.7 nM \u00b1 87.3 nM.</p>\n  b. Serotonin (5-HT<sub>3</sub>)</p>\n  Procedure: GR65630 binds to the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor. Brain Cortices were obtained from male rats and a membrane fraction prepared by standard techniques. ).04 mg of membrane prep was incubated with 0.2 nM [<sup>3</sup>H]-GR65630 for 66 minutes at 22'C. Non-specific binding was estimated in the presence of 1 uM ICS 205-930. Membranes were filtered and washed 3 times and the filters were counted to determine [<sup>3</sup>H]-GR65630 specifically bound.
