    " was added to the cells in the 96-well plate. The above quantities are requirements per well of a 96-well plate. Master mixes were made for the entire plate, with proportional quantity of reagents being used. </p> \u2022 5h after transfection, compounds were added to the wells in DMEM without phenol red and containing 10% CS-FBS, maintaining a final DMSO concentration of 0.5%. A typical dose response curve starts at 10\u03bc\u039c and includes a 7-point, log dilution, done in triplicates. </p> \u2022 After overnight incubation with the compounds, 10Oul of working solution of Steady- glow reagent was added to the wells. </p>\u00b7 The plates were placed in a shaker for 15 min at the end of which the lysate containing luciferase was transferred to a white flat-bottom plate and read under a luminescence setting in Victor. </p> \u2022 Background subtracted counts (Luminescence from DMSO control wells is considered the background) are used to calculate percentage activity, expressed relative to activity with 1 \u03bc\u039c (Dihydrotestosterone) DHT (at least two sets of triplicates for 1 \u03bc\u039c DHT are included per plate). </p>Data fitting: The EC<sub>50</sub> curves for the compounds for 8 compound concentrations were fitted by the respective function using non-linear least-squares regression in Graphpad Prism 4.0 (Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). </p>Examples 26 to 31 were synthesised in analogous manner to the examples described above. </p>Biological activity </p>Example number Chemical structure (C2C12 cell) </p>EC50 (nM) \n\n 82 </p></p></p></p></p> Table 1 </p><sup>*</sup> % Biological activity (C2C12 cell) 100 nM/5 \u03bc\u039c *<sup>*</sup> at 5 \u03bc\u039c concentration, &lt;10% activity </p>Example 33: In vivo modified Hershberqer assay comparing compounds of formula I with testosterone and ostarine. </p>Efficacy of Testosterone Propionate, Ostarine, compounds of examples 1 and 5 in modified Hershberger assay in male wistar rats Evaluation of Testosterone Propionate, Ostarine, examples 1 and 5 in modified Hershberger assay in male wistar rats was conducted at the Department of Preclinical Biology, Aurigene Discovery Technologies Ltd., Bangalore, India. </p>All rats from respective treatment groups survived during the course of the study period of 14 days. No significant alterations were observed in any of the in-life parameters (clinical signs, body weight, and food consumption) during the course of study period. </p>The 14 days treatment of Ostarine, compounds of examples 1 and 5 to orchidectomized male rats showed dose dependent selective increase in weights of levator ani compared to prostate (cf. Figures 1 and 2). Testosterone Propionate did not show any selectivity on levator ani versus prostate. </p>The clinical pathology parameters viz. hematology and clinical chemistry showed no adverse changes while dose dependent decrease was observed for luteinizing hormone \n\n (LH) levels for all test articles in comparison to ORX animals.
