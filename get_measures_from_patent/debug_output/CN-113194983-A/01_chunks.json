    "aining 3-8 members. An optionally substituted group or moiety refers to a group or moiety (e.g., any of the groups or moieties described above) in which one atom (e.g., a hydrogen atom) is optionally replaced with another substituent. For example, an optionally substituted alkyl group may be an optionally substituted methyl group wherein the hydrogen atom of the methyl group is replaced by, for example, OH. As another example, a substituent on a heteroalkyl group or its divalent counterpart heteroalkylene may replace a hydrogen on a carbon or a hydrogen on a heteroatom such as N. For example, the hydrogen atoms in the group-R-NH-R-may be substituted with an alkylamide substituent, such as-R-N [ (CH)<sub>2</sub>C(O)N(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]-R\u3002</p>In general, the optional substituents are non-interfering substituents. \"non-interfering substituent\" refers to a substituent that retains the ability of a conjugate described herein (e.g., a conjugate of any of formulae (1) - (5), (D-I) - (D-X), (D '-I), (M-I) - (M-X), or (M' -I)) to bind to viral neuraminidase or inhibit the proliferation of influenza virus. Thus, in some embodiments, the substituent may alter the degree of activity. However, as long as the conjugate retains the ability to bind to viral neuraminidase or inhibit viral proliferation, the substituent will be classified as \"non-interfering\". For example, a non-interfering substituent will retain the ability of the compound to provide antiviral efficacy based on an IC50 value of 10 \u03bc M or less in a viral plaque reduction assay (such as an IC50 value for influenza virus neuraminidase of less than 500nM in example 2). Thus, the substituents may alter the degree of inhibition based on plaque reduction or influenza virus neuraminidase inhibition. However, as long as the compounds described herein, such as compounds of formulas (A-I), (A-II), (A-III), (A-IV), (A-V), (A-VI), (A-VII), (A-VIII), (A-IX), (A-X), (A-XI) and (A-XII), retain the ability to inhibit influenza virus neuraminidase activity, the substituents will be classified as \"non-interfering\". A variety of assays for determining viral plaque reduction or the ability of any compound to inhibit influenza virus neuraminidase are available in the art and some are exemplified in the examples below. </p>The term \"hetero\", when used to describe a chemical group or moiety, refers to a heteroatom having at least one heteroatom other than carbon or hydrogen, such as N, O and S. Any of the above groups or moieties may be referred to as hetero if it contains at least one heteroatom. For example, heterocycloalkyl, heterocycloalkenyl, or heterocycloalkynyl refers to a cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, or cycloalkynyl having one or more heteroatoms independently selected from, for example, N, O and S. An example of a heterocycloalkenyl group is a maleimido group. For example, heteroaryl refers to an aromatic group having one or more heteroatoms independently selected from, for example, N, O and S. One or more heteroatoms may also be included in the substituents replacing a hydro",

    "ably human serum albumin. Albumin binding peptides may be of different origin, e.g. synthetic, human, mouse or rat. Albumin binding peptides of the invention include albumin binding peptides that have been engineered to include one or more (e.g., two, three, four, or five) solvent exposed cysteine or lysine residues, which can provide sites for conjugation to compounds of the invention (e.g., conjugation to neuraminidase inhibitor monomers or dimers, including by means of a linker). Most preferably, the albumin binding peptide will contain a single solvent exposed cysteine or lysine, thus enabling site-specific conjugation of the compounds of the invention. The albumin binding peptide may comprise only naturally occurring amino acid residues, or may comprise one or more non-naturally occurring amino acid residues. Where included, non-naturally occurring amino acid residues (e.g., side chains of non-naturally occurring amino acid residues) can be used as attachment points for the compounds of the invention (e.g., neuraminidase inhibitor monomers or dimers, including by means of a linker). The albumin binding peptides of the invention may be linear or cyclic.

Test articles (zanamivir, oseltamivir, baloxavir, conjugate 6 and conjugate 21) in a dosage range between 1.93-10000nM were incubated at Room Temperature (RT) with influenza A/WSN/1933 at a virus: cell multiplicity of infection (MOI) between 0.001-1 for 1 h.
