{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nNon-specific binding was defined as binding in the presence of 1 \u03bcM nociceptin and accounted for 90-95% of total binding.\nIC50 values were calculated from inhibition curves by a non-linear regression analysis using the GraphPad Prism program (GraphPad Software, USA) and converted to K, values using the equation: K, = IC50/(1+[L]/Kd) where [L] is the concentration of radioligand and Kd the dissociation constant.\nMaximal stimulation to nociceptin was determined from dose-response curves and was 50-80% above basal levels of [35S]-GTP-g-S binding. \nSchild-analysis of dose-response curves to nociceptin in the presence or ab- sence of antagonists were used to determine the potency of the compounds and these data are expressed as pKB."}
