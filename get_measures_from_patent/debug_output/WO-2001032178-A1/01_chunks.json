Cells were initially selected using 0.75 mg/ml G418 and 0.5 mg/ml was used in the culture media.</p>Membrane preparation BHK cells expressing ORL1 was harvested with phosphate buffered saline supplemented with 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4 and centrifuged (1000 x g, 5 min, 4 \u00b0C). The pellet was homogenised in assay buffer (50 mM TRIS-HCI, pH 7.8, 5 mM MgCI<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 mM EGTA, 1 mg/ml BSA, 0.2 mg/ml bacitracin.) and centrifuged (40000 x g, 4\u00b0C, 20 min). The resulting pellet was homogenised in assay buffer supplemented with 10% sucrose (w/vol) and membranes were frozen in aliquots at -80\u00b0C.</p>[<sup>125</sup>l]-Tyr<sup>14</sup>-Nociceptin binding assay- Frozen membranes were thawed, homogenised briefly and kept on ice until use. For competition binding studies, test compounds, membranes (0.05 mg protein/well), 1.0 mg SPA beads/well (WGA PVT beads, Amersham) and buffer was added to 96 well plates at 25\u00b0C in a final volume of 200 \u03bcl. The incubation was started by adding 0.05 nM [<sup>125</sup>l]-Tyr<sup>14</sup>- Nociceptin (New England Nuclear, Boston, U.S.A., specific activity = 2200 Ci/mmol). Plates were incubated for 120 min at 25\u00b0C on a shaking table and subsequently counted in a Top- counter (Packard, Illinois, U.S.A) after settling of the beads. Non-specific binding was defined as binding in the presence of 1 \u03bcM nociceptin and accounted for 90-95% of total binding.</p>IC50 values were calculated from inhibition curves by a non-linear regression analysis using the GraphPad Prism program (GraphPad Software, USA) and converted to K, values using the equation: K, = IC<sub>5</sub>o/(1+[L]/K<sub>d</sub>) where [L] is the concentration of radioligand and K<sub>d</sub> the dissociation constant.</p>[<sup>35</sup>S]-GTP-g-S binding assay</p>The functional activity of testcompounds were determined using a [<sup>35</sup>S]-GTP-g-S binding assay as detailed: Membranes (see above) were thawed, homogenised briefly and kept on ice until use. Test compounds, membranes (0.1 mg protein/well), 2.0 mg SPA beads/well (WGA PVT beads, Amersham), 1 \u03bcM GDP (Sigma, St. Louis, U.S.A.) and buffer was added to 96 well plates at 25\u00b0C in a volume of 175 \u03bcl. After 30 min pre-incubation at 25\u00b0C, the incubation was started by adding 25 \u03bcl [<sup>35</sup>S]-GTP-g-S (New England Nuclear, Boston, U.S.A., specific activity = 1100 Ci/mmol) to a final concentration of 0.2 nM. Plates were incubated for a further 60 min at 25\u00b0C on a shaking table and subsequently counted in a Top-counter (Packard, Illinois, U.S.A) after settling of the beads. Maximal stimulation to nociceptin was \n\ndetermined from dose-response curves and was 50-80% above basal levels of [<sup>35</sup>S]-GTP-g-S binding. For agonist studies the efficacy of the compounds were compared to the maximal stimulation and for antagonist studies, the test compounds were applied together with nociceptin (1 \u03bcM). Schild-analysis of dose-response curves to nociceptin in the presence or ab- sence of antagonists were used to determine the potency of the compounds and these data are expressed as pK<sub>B</sub>.</p>PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS</p>In another aspect, the present invention includes within its scope pharmaceutical compositions comprising, as an active ingredient, at least one of the compounds of the general formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof together "
