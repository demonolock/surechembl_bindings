These applications are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entireties, including the drawings.</p>Field Of The Invention</p>The present invention concerns compounds, compositions, and methods for the study, diagnosis, and treatment of conditions and diseases that respond to the modulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and/or vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (e.g., VEGFr 1, VEGFr2 and/or VEGFr3) gene expression and/or activity. The present invention also concerns compounds, compositions, and methods relating to conditions and diseases that respond to the modulation of",
    "ion, genomic discovery, genetic engineering, and pharmacogenomic applications.</p>In one embodiment, the invention features one or more siNA molecules and methods that independently or in combination modulate the expression of gene(s) encoding proteins, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and or vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (e.g., VEGFrl, VEGFr2, VEGFr3), associated with the maintenance and/or development of cancer and other proliferative diseases, such as genes encoding sequences comprising those sequences referred to by GenBank Accession Nos. shown in Table I, referred to herein generally as VEGF and/or VEGFr. The description below of the various aspects and embodiments of the invention is provided with reference to the exemplary VEGF and VEGFr (e.g., VEGFrl, VEGFr2, VEGFr3) genes referred to herein as VEGF and VEGFr respectively. However, the various aspects and embodiments are also directed to other VEGF and/or VEGFr genes, such as mutant VEGF and/or VEGFr genes, splice variants of VEGF and/or VEGFr genes, other VEGF and/or VEGFr ligands and receptors. The various aspects and embodiments are also directed to other genes that are involved in VEGF and/or VEGFr mediated pathways of signal transduction or gene expression that are \n\ninvolved in the progression, development, and/or maintenance of disease (e.g., cancer). Those additional genes can be analyzed for target sites using the methods described for VEGF and/or VEGFr genes herein. Thus, the inhibition and the effects of such inhibition of the other genes can be performed as described herein.</p>In one embodiment, the invention features a siNA molecule that down-regulates expression of a VEGF gene, for example, wherein the VEGF gene comprises VEGF encoding sequence.</p>In one embodiment, the invention features a siNA molecule that down-regulates expression of a VEGFr gene, for example, wherein the VEGFr gene comprises VEGFr encoding sequence.</p>In one embodiment, the invention features a siNA molecule having RNAi activity against VEGF and/or VEGFr RNA, wherein the siNA molecule comprises a sequence complementary to any RNA having VEGF and/or VEGFr or other VEGF and/or VEGFr encoding sequence, such as those sequences having GenBank Accession Nos. shown in Table I. Chemical modifications as shown in Tables III and IV or otherwise described herein can be applied to any siNA constract of the invention.</p>In one embodiment, the invention features a siNA molecule having RNAi activity against VEGF and/or VEGFr RNA, wherein the siNA molecule comprises a sequence complementary to any RNA having VEGF and/or VEGFr encoding sequence, such as those sequences having VEGF and/or VEGFr GenBank Accession Nos. shown in Table I. Chemical modifications as shown in Tables III and IV or otherwise described herein can be applied to any siNA constract of the invention.</p>In another embodiment, the invention features a siNA molecule having RNAi activity against a VEGF and/or VEGFr gene, wherein the siNA molecule compri",
    "r a portion thereof, and wherein the circular polynucleotide can be processed either in vivo or in vitro to generate an active siNA molecule capable of mediating RNAi. The siNA can also comprise a single stranded polynucleotide having nucleotide sequence complementary to nucleotide sequence in a target nucleic acid molecule or a portion thereof (for example, where such siNA molecule does not require the presence within the siNA molecule of nucleotide sequence conesponding to the target nucleic acid sequence or a portion thereof), wherein the single stranded polynucleotide can further comprise a terminal phosphate group, such as a 5 '-phosphate (see for example Martinez et al., 2002, Cell, 110, 563-574 and Schwarz et al, 2002, Molecular Cell, 10, 537-568), or 5 ',3 '-diphosphate. In certain embodiment, the siNA molecule of the invention comprises separate sense and antisense \n\nsequences or regions, wherein the sense and antisense regions are covalently linked by nucleotide or non-nucleotide linkers molecules as is known in the art, or are alternately non- covalently linked by ionic interactions, hydrogen bonding, van der waals interactions, hydrophobic intercations, and/or stacking interactions. In certain embodiments, the siNA molecules of the invention comprise nucleotide sequence that is complementary to nucleotide sequence of a target gene. In another embodiment, the siNA molecule of the invention interacts with nucleotide sequence of a target gene in a manner that causes inhibition of expression of the target gene. As used herein, siNA molecules need not be limited to those molecules containing only RNA, but further encompasses chemically- modified nucleotides and non-nucleotides. In certain embodiments, the short interfering nucleic acid molecules of the mvention lack 2'-hydroxy (2'-OH) containing nucleotides. Applicant describes in certain embodiments short interfering nucleic acids that do not require the presence of nucleotides having a 2'-hydroxy group for mediating RNAi and as such, short interfering nucleic acid molecules of the invention optionally do not mclude any ribonucleotides (e.g., nucleotides having a 2'-OH group). Such siNA molecules that do not require the presence of ribonucleotides within the siNA molecule to support RNAi can however have an attached linker or linkers or other attached or associated groups, moieties, or chains containing one or more nucleotides with 2'-OH groups. Optionally, siNA molecules can comprise ribonucleotides at about 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50% of the nucleotide positions. The modified short interfering nucleic acid molecules of the invention can also be referred to as short interfering modified oligonucleotides \"siMON.\" As used herein, the term siNA is meant to be equivalent to other terms used to describe nucleic acid molecules that are capable of mediating sequence specific RNAi, for example short interfering RNA (siRNA), double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), micro-RNA (miRNA), short hai\u03c6in RNA (shRNA), ",
    "terference, such as post transcriptional gene silencing, or epigenetics. For example, siNA molecules of the invention can be used to epigenetically silence genes at both the post-transcriptional level or the pre- transcriptional level. In a non-limiting example, epigenetic regulation of gene expression by \n\nsiNA molecules of the invention can result from siNA mediated modification of chromatin structure to alter gene expression (see, for example, AUshire, 2002, Science, 297, 1818- 1819; Volpe et al, 2002, Science, 297, 1833-1837; Jenuwein, 2002, Science, 297, 2215- 2218; and Hall et al, 2002, Science, 297, 2232-2237).</p>By \"modulate\" is meant that the expression of the gene, or level of RNA molecule or equivalent RNA molecules encoding one or more proteins or protein subunits, or activity of one or more proteins or protein subunits is up regulated or down regulated, such that expression, level, or activity is greater than or less than that observed in the absence of the modulator. For example, the term \"modulate\" can mean \"inhibit,\" but the use of the word \"modulate\" is not limited to this definition.</p>By \"inhibit\", \"down-regulate\", or \"reduce\", it is meant that the expression of the gene, or level of RNA molecules or equivalent RNA molecules encoding one or more proteins or protein subunits, or activity of one or more proteins or protein subunits, is reduced below that observed in the absence of the nucleic acid molecules (e.g., siNA) of the invention. In one embodiment, inhibition, down-regulation or reduction with an siNA molecule is below that level observed in the presence of an inactive or attenuated molecule. In another embodiment, inhibition, down-regulation, or reduction with siNA molecules is below that level observed in the presence of, for example, an siNA molecule with scrambled sequence or with mismatches. In another embodiment, inhibition, down-regulation, or reduction of gene expression with a nucleic acid molecule of the instant invention is greater in the presence of the nucleic acid molecule than in its absence.</p>By \"gene\" or \"target gene\" is meant, a nucleic acid that encodes an RNA, for example, nucleic acid sequences including, but not limited to, stractural genes encoding a polypeptide. The target gene can be a gene derived from a cell, an endogenous gene, a transgene, or exogenous genes such as genes of a pathogen, for example a virus, which is present in the cell after infection thereof. The cell containing the target gene can be derived from or contained in any organism, for example a plant, animal, protozoan, virus, bacterium, or fungus. Non-limiting examples of plants include monocots, dicots, or gymnosperms. Non- \n\nlimiting examples of animals include vertebrates or invertebrates. Non-limiting examples of fungi include molds or yeasts.</p>By \"VEGF\" as used herein is meant, any vascular endothelial growth factor (e.g., VEGF, VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D) protein, peptide, or polypeptide having vascular endothelial growth factor activity, such as encoded by VEGF Genbank Accession Nos. shown in Table I. The term VEGF also refers to nucleic acid sequences encloding any vascular endothelial growth factor protein, peptide, or polypeptide having vascular endothelial growth factor activity.</p>By \"VEGF-B\" is meant, protein, peptide, or polypeptide receptor or a derivative thereof, such as ",
    "s indicated in the figure, these chemistries can be combined with different backbone modifications as described herein, for example, backbone modifications having Formula I. In addition, the 2'-deoxy nucleotide shown 5' to the terminal modifications shown can be another modified or unmodified nucleotide or non- nucleotide described herein, for example modifications having any of Formulae I-VII or any combination thereof.</p>Figure 11 shows a non-limiting example of a strategy used to identify chemically modified siNA constructs of the invention that are nuclease resistance while preserving the ability to mediate RNAi activity. Chemical modifications are introduced into the siNA construct based on educated design parameters (e.g. infroducing 2'-mofications, base modifications, backbone modifications, terminal cap modifications etc). The modified construct in tested in an appropriate system (e.g. human serum for nuclease resistance, shown, or an animal model for PK/delivery parameters). In parallel, the siNA constract is tested for RNAi activity, for example in a cell culture system such as a luciferase reporter assay). Lead siNA constracts are then identified which possess a particular characteristic while maintaining RNAi activity, and can be further modified and assayed once again. This same approach can be used to identify siNA-conjugate molecules with improved pharmacokinetic profiles, delivery, and RNAi activity.</p>Figure 12 shows a non-limiting example of siNA mediated inhibition of VEGF- induced angiogenesis using the rat comeal model of angiogenesis. siNA targeting site 2340 of VEGFrl RNA 29695/29699 (shown as RPI No. sense sfrand/antisense strand) was compared to an inverted control siNA 29983/29984 (shown as RPI No. sense strand/antisense strand) at three different concentrations (lug, 3ug, and lOug) and compared to a VEGF control in which no siNA was administered. As shown in the Figure, siNA \n\nconstructs targeting VEGFrl RNA can provide significant inhibition of angiogenesis in the rat comeal model.</p>Figure 13 shows a non-limiting example of reduction of VEGFrl mRNA in A375 cells mediated by chemically-modified siNAs that target VEGFrl mRNA. A549 cells were transfected with 0.25 ug/well of lipid complexed with 25 nM siNA. A screen of siNA constructs (Stabilization \"Stab\" chemistries are shown in Table IV, constructs are refened to by RPI number, see Table III) comprising Stab 4/5 chemistry (RPI 31190/31193), Stab 1/2 chemistry (RPI 31183/31186 and RPI 31184/31187), and unmodified RNA (RPI 30075/30076) were compared to untreated cells, matched chemistry inverted confrol siNA constructs, (RPI 31208/31211, RPI 31201/31204, RPI 31202/31205, and RPI 30077/30078) scrambled siNA confrol constructs (Scraml and Scram2), and cells transfected with lipid alone (transfection control). All of the siNA constracts show significant reduction of VEGFrl RNA expression.</p>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</p>Mechanism of action of Nucleic Acid Molecules of the Invention</p>The discussion that follows discusses the proposed mechanism of RNA interference mediated by short interfering RNA as is presently known, and is not meant to be limiting and is not an admission of prior art. Applicant demonstrates herein that chemically- modified short interfering nucleic acids possess similar or improved capacity to mediate RNAi as do siRNA molecules and are expected to possess improved stability and activity in vivo; therefore, this discussion ",
    "idine dinucleotides.</p>8. Four or five target sites are chosen from the ranked list of subsequences as described above. For example, in subsequences having 23 nucleotides, the right 21 nucleotides of each chosen 23-mer subsequence are then designed and synthesized for the upper (sense) strand of the siNA duplex, while the reverse complement of the left 21 nucleotides of each chosen 23-mer subsequence are then designed and synthesized for the lower (antisense) strand of the siNA duplex (see Tables II and III). If terminal TT residues are desired for the sequence (as described in paragraph 7), then the two 3' terminal nucleotides of both the sense and antisense strands are replaced by TT prior to synthesizing the oligos.</p>9. The siNA molecules are screened in an in vitro, cell culture or animal model system to identify the most active siNA molecule or the most prefened target site within the target RNA sequence.</p>In an alternate approach, a pool of siNA constructs specific to a VEGF and/or VEGFr target sequence is used to screen for target sites in cells expressing VEGF and/or VEGFr RNA, such as HUVEC, HMVEC, or A375 cells. The general strategy used in this approach \n\nis shown in Figure 9. A non-limiting example of such is a pool comprising sequences having any of SEQ ID NOS 1-2238. Cells expressing VEGF and/or VEGFr (e.g., HUVEC, HMVEC, or A375 cells) are transfected with the pool of siNA constructs and cells that demonstrate a phenotype associated with VEGF and/or VEGFr inhibition are sorted. The pool of siNA constructs can be expressed from franscription cassettes inserted into appropriate vectors (see for example Figure 7 and Figure 8). The siNA from cells demonstrating a positive phenotypic change (e.g., decreased proliferation, decreased VEGF and/or VEGFr mRNA levels or decreased VEGF and/or VEGFr protein expression), are sequenced to determine the most suitable target site(s) within the target VEGF and/or VEGFr RNA sequence.</p>Example 4: VEGF and/or VEGFr targeted siNA design</p>siNA target sites were chosen by analyzing sequences of the VEGF and/or VEGFr RNA target and optionally prioritizing the target sites on the basis of folding (stracture of any given sequence analyzed to determine siNA accessibility to the target), by using a library of siNA molecules as described in Example 3, or alternately by using an in vitro siNA system as described in Example 6 herein. siNA molecules were designed that could bind each target and are optionally individually analyzed by computer folding to assess whether the siNA molecule can interact with the target sequence. Varying the length of the siNA molecules can be chosen to optimize activity. Generally, a sufficient number of complementary nucleotide bases are chosen to bind to, or otherwise interact with, the target RNA, but the degree of complementarity can be modulated to accommodate siNA duplexes or varying length or base composition. By using such methodologies, siNA molecules can be designed ",
    "at 25\u00b0 C for 10 minutes before adding RNA, then incubated at 25\u00b0 C for an additional 60 minutes. Reactions are quenched with 4 volumes of 1.25 x Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega). Target RNA cleavage is assayed by RT-PCR analysis or other methods known in the art and are compared to confrol reactions in which siNA is omitted from the reaction.</p>Alternately, internally-labeled target RNA for the assay is prepared by in vitro franscription in the presence of [alpha-<sup>32</sup>p] CTP, passed over a G 50 Sephadex column by spin chromatography and used as target RNA without further purification. Optionally, \n\ntarget RNA is 5'-32p_end labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase enzyme. Assays are performed as described above and target RNA and the specific RNA cleavage products generated by RNAi are visualized on an autoradiograph of a gel. The percentage of cleavage is determined by Phosphor Imager\u00ae quantitation of bands representing intact control RNA or RNA from control reactions without siNA and the cleavage products generated by the assay.</p>In one embodiment, this assay is used to determine target sites the VEGF and/or</p>VEGFr RNA target for siNA mediated RNAi cleavage, wherein a plurality of siNA constructs are screened for RNAi mediated cleavage of the VEGF and/or VEGFr RNA target, for example, by analyzing the assay reaction by electrophoresis of labeled target</p>RNA, or by northern blotting, as well as by other methodology well known in the art.</p>Example 7: Nucleic acid inhibition of VEGF and/or VEGFr target RNA in vivo siNA molecules targeted to the huma VEGF and/or VEGFr RNA are designed and synthesized as described above. These nucleic acid molecules can be tested for cleavage activity in vivo, for example, using the following procedure. The target sequences and the nucleotide location within the VEGF and/or VEGFr RNA are given in Table II and III.</p>Two formats are used to test the efficacy of siNAs targeting VEGF and/or VEGFr. First, the reagents are tested in cell culture using, for example, HUVEC, HMVEC, or A375 cells to determine the extent of RNA and protein inhibition. siNA reagents (e.g.; see Tables II and III) are selected against the VEGF and/or VEGFr target as described herein. RNA inhibition is measured after delivery of these reagents by a suitable transfection agent to, for example, HUVEC, HMVEC, or A375 cells. Relative amounts of target RNA are measured versus actin using real-time PCR monitoring of amplification (eg, ABI 7700 Taqman\u00ae). A comparison is made to a mixture of oligonucleotide sequences made to unrelated targets or to a randomized siNA confrol with the same overall length and chemistry, but randomly substituted at each position. Primary and secondary lead reagents are chosen for the target and optimization performed. After an optimal transfection agent concentration is chosen, a \n\nRNA time-course of inhibition is performed with the lead siNA molecule. In addition, a cell-plating format can be used to determine RNA inhibition.</p>Delivery of siNA to Cells</p>Cells (e.g., HUVEC, HMVEC, or A375 cells) are seeded, for example, at lxlO<sup>5</sup> cells per well of a six- well dish in EGM-2 (BioWhittaker) the day before fransfection. siNA (final concentration, for example 20nM) and cationic lipid (e.g., final concentration 2\u03bcg/ml) are complexed in EGM basal media (Biowhittaker) at 37\u00b0C for 30 mins in polystyrene tubes.</p>Following vortexing, the complexed siNA is added to each well and incubated for the times indicated. For initial optimization experiments, cells are seeded, for example, at lxl 0^ in 96 well plates and siNA complex added as described. Efficiency of delivery of siNA to cells is determined using a fluorescent siNA complexed with lipid. Cells in 6-well dishes are incubated with siNA for 24 hours, rinsed with PBS and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes at room temperature. Uptake of siNA is visualized using a fluorescent microscope.</p>Taqman and Lightcycler quantification of mRNA</p>Total RNA is prepared from cells following siNA delivery, for example, using Qiagen RNA purification kits for 6-well or Rneasy extraction kits for 96-well assays. For Taqman analysis, dual-labeled probes are synthesized with the reporter dye, FAM or JOE, covalently linked at the 5'-end and the quencher dye TAMRA conjugated to the 3'-end. One-step RT- PCR amplifications are performed on, for example, an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detector using 50 \u03bcl reactions consisting of 10 \u03bcl total RNA, 10",
    "man glioblastomas, it has been shown that VEGF is at least partially responsible for tumor angiogenesis (Plate et al, 1992 Nature 359, 845). Animal models have been developed in which glioblastoma cells are implanted subcutaneously into nude mice and the progress of tumor growth and angiogenesism is studied (Kim et al, 1993 supra; Millauer et al, 1994 supra).</p>Another animal model that addresses neovascularization involves Matrigel, an extract of basement membrane that becomes a solid gel when injected subcutaneously (Passaniti et al, 1992 Lab. Invest. 61: 519-528). When the Matrigel is supplemented with angiogenesis factors such as VEGF, vessels grow into the Matrigel over a period of 3 to 5 days and angiogenesis can be assessed. Again, nucleic acids directed against VEGFr mRNAs are delivered in the Matrigel.</p>Several animal models exist for screening of anti-angiogenic agents. These include comeal vessel formation following corneal injury (Burger et al, 1985 Cornea 4: 35-41; Lepri, et al, 1994 J. Ocular Pharmacol. 10: 273-280; Ormerod et al, 1990 Am. J. Pathol. 137: 1243-1252) or infracorneal growth factor implant (Grant et al, 1993 Diabetologia 36: 282-291; Pandey et al. 1995 supra; Zieche et al, 1992 Lab. Invest. 61: 711-715), vessel growth into Matrigel matrix containing growth factors (Passaniti et al, 1992 supra), female reproductive organ neovascularization following hormonal manipulation (Shweiki et al, 1993 Clin. Invest. 91: 2235-2243), several models involving inhibition of tumor growth in highly vascularized solid tumors (O'Reilly et al., 1994 Cell 79: 315-328; Senger et al, 1993 Cancer and Metas. Rev. 12: 303-324; Takahasi et al, 1994 Cancer Res. 54: 4233- 4237; Kim et al, 1993 supra), and transient hypoxia-induced neovascularization in the mouse retina (Pierce et al, 1995 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 92: 905-909).</p>The cornea model, described in Pandey et al. supra, is the most common and well characterized model for screening anti-angiogenic agent efficacy. This model involves an \n\navascular tissue into which vessels are recruited by a stimulating agent (growth factor, thermal or alkalai bum, endotoxin). The comeal model utilizes the intrastromal comeal implantation of a Teflon pellet soaked in a VEGF-Hydron solution to recruit blood vessels toward the pellet, which can be quantitated using standard microscopic and image analysis techniques. To evaluate their anti-angiogenic efficacy, nucleic acids are applied topically to the eye or bound within Hydron on the Teflon pellet itself. This avascular cornea as well as the Matrigel (see below) provide for low background assays. While the comeal model has been performed extensively in the rabbit, studies in the rat have also been conducted.</p>The mouse model (Passaniti et al., supra) is a non-tissue model that utilizes Matrigel, an extract of basement membrane (Kleinman et al., 1986) or Millipore\u00ae filter disk, which can be impregnated with growth factors and anti-angiogenic agents ",
    "imens. Concunent pharmacokinetic studies \n\ncan be performed to determine whether sufficient tissue levels of siRNA can be achieved for pharmacodynamic effect to be expected. Furthermore, primary tumors and secondary lung metastases can be removed and subjected to a variety of in vitro studies (t.e. target RNA reduction).</p>In addition, animal models are useful in screening compounds, eg. siRNA molecules, for efficacy in treating renal failure, such as a result of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The HamSPRD rat model, mice with a targeted mutation in the Pkd2 gene and congenital polycystic kidney (cpk) mice, closely resemble human ADPKD and provide animal models to evaluate the therapeutic effect of siRNA constructs that have the potential to interfere with one or more of the pathogenic elements of ADPKD mediated renal failure, such as angiogenesis. Angiogenesis may be necessary in the progression of ADPKD for growth of cyst cells as well as increased vascular permeability promoting fluid secretion into cysts. Proliferation of cystic epithelium is also a feature of ADPKD because cyst cells in culture produce soluble vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGFrl has also been detected in epithelial cells of cystic tubules but not in endothelial cells in the vasculature of cystic kidneys or normal kidneys. VEGFr2 expression is increased in endothelial cells of cyst vessels and in endothelial cells during renal ischemia-reperfusion. It is proposed that inhibition of VEGF receptors with anti- VEGFrl and anti-VEGFr2 siRNA molecules would attenuate cyst formation, renal failure and mortality in ADPKD. Anti- VEGFr2 siRNA molecules would therefore be designed to inhibit angiogenesis involved in cyst formation. As VEGFrl is present in cystic epithelium and not in vascular endothelium of cysts, it is proposed that anti-VEGFrl siRNA molecules would attenuate cystic epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis which would in turn lead to less cyst formation. Further, it is proposed that VEGF produced by cystic epithelial cells is one of the stimuli for angiogenesis as well as epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis. The use of HamSPRD rats (see for eaxmple Kaspareit-Rittinghausen et al, 1991, Am.J.Pathol. 139, 693-696), mice with a targeted mutation in the Pkd2 gene (Pkd2-/- mice, see for example Wu et al, 2000, Nat. Genet. 24, 75-78) and cpk mice (see for example Woo et al, 1994, Nature, 368, 750- 753) all provide animal models to study the efficacy of siRNA molecles of the invention against VEGFrl and VEGFr2 mediated renal failure. \n\n VEGF, VEGFrl VGFR2 and/or VEGFr3 protein levels can be measured clinically or experimentally by FACS analysis. VEGF, VEGFrl VGFR2 and/or VEGFr3 encoded mRNA levels are assessed by Northern analysis, RNase-protection, primer extension analysis and/or quantitative RT-PCR. siRNA nucleic acids that block VEGF, VEGFrl VGFR2 and/or VEGFr3 protein encoding mRNAs and therefore result in decreased levels of VEGF, VEGFrl VGFR2 and/or VEGFr3 activity by more than 20% in vitro can be identified.</p>Example 9: siNA-mediated inhibition of angiogenesis in vivo</p>The pu\u03c6ose of this study was to assess the anti-angiogenic activity of siNA targeted against VEGFrl in the rat cornea model of VEGF induced angiogenesis (see above). The siNA molecules have matched inverted controls, which are inactive since they are not able to interact with the RNA target. The siNA molecules and VEGF were co-delivered using the filter disk method: Nitrocellulose filter disks (Millipore\u00ae) of 0.057 diameter were immersed in appropriate solutions and were surgically implanted in rat cornea as described by Pandey et al, supra.</p>The stimulus for angiogenesis in this study was the freatment of the filter disk with 30 \u03bcM VEGF, which is implanted within the cornea's stroma. This dose yields reproducible neovascularization stemming from the pericorneal vascular plexus growing toward the disk in a dose-response study 5 days following implant. Filter disks treated only with the vehicle for VEGF show no angiogenic response. The siNA were co-adminstered with VEGF on a disk in two different siNA concentrations. One concern with the simultaneous administration is that the siNA would not be able to inhibit angiogenesis since VEGF receptors could be stimulated. However, Applicant has observed that in low VEGF doses, the neovascular response reverts to normal, suggesting that the VEGF stimulus is essential for maintaining the angiogenic response. Blocking the production of VEGF receptors using simultaneous administration of anti-VEGF-R",
    "uplexed siNA. For the 20\u03bcg/eye treatment, 6 \u03bcLs of the 3.34 mg/mL duplex is injected into the eye (see below). The 3.34 mg/mL duplex siNA can then be serially diluted for dose response assays.</p>Preparation of VEGF Filter Disk</p>For comeal implantation, 0.57 mm diameter nitrocellulose disks, prepared from 0.45 \u03bcm pore diameter nitrocellulose filter membranes (Millipore Co\u03c6oration), were soaked for</p>30 min in 1 \u03bcL of 75 \u03bcM VEGF in 82 mM TrisHCl (pH 6.9) in covered petri dishes on ice.</p>Filter disks soaked only with the vehicle for VEGF (83 mM Tris-Cl pH 6.9) elicit no angiogenic response.</p>Comeal surgery</p>The rat comeal model used in this study was a modified from Koch et al Supra and</p>Pandey et al., supra. Briefly, corneas were irrigated with 0.5% povidone iodine solution followed by normal saline and two drops of 2% lidocaine. Under a dissecting microscope</p>(Leica MZ-6), a stromal pocket was created and a presoaked filter disk (see above) was inserted into the pocket such that its edge was 1 mm from the comeal limbus.</p>Intraconjunctival injection of test solutions</p>Immediately after disk insertion, the tip of a 40-50 \u03bcm OD injector (constracted in our laboratory) was inserted within the conjunctival tissue 1 mm away from the edge of the comeal limbus that was directly adjacent to the VEGF-soaked filter disk. Six hundred nanoliters of test solution (siNA, inverted control or sterile water vehicle) were dispensed at a rate of 1.2 \u03bcL/min using a syringe pump (Kd Scientific). The injector was then removed, serially rinsed in 70% ethanol and sterile water and immersed in sterile water between each injection. Once the test solution was injected, closure of the eyelid was maintained using \n\nmicroaneurism clips until the animal began to recover gross motor activity. Following treatment, animals were warmed on a heating pad at 37 C.</p>Quantitation of angiogenic response</p>Five days after disk implantation, animals were euthanized following adminisfration of</p>0.4 mg/kg afropine and corneas were digitally imaged. The neovascular surface area (NSA, expressed in pixels) was measured postmortem from blood-filled corneal vessels using computerized mo\u03c6hometry (Image Pro Plus, Media Cybernetics, v2.0). The individual mean NSA was determined in triplicate from three regions of identical size in the area of maximal neovascularization between the filter disk and the limbus. The number of pixels conesponding to the blood-filled comeal vessels in these regions was summated to produce an index of NSA. A group mean NSA was then calculated. Data from each freatment group were normalized to VEGF/siNA vehicle-treated control NSA and finally expressed as percent inhibition of VEGF-induced angiogenesis.</p>Statistics</p>After determining the normality of treatment group means, group mean percent inhibition of VEGF-induced angiogenesis was subjected to a one-way analysis of variance.</p>This was followed by two post-hoc tests for significance including Dunnett's (comparison to VEGF confrol) and Tukey-Kramer (all other group mean comparisons) at alpha = 0.05.</p>Statistical analyses were performed using MP v.3.1.6 (SAS Institute).</p>Results are graphically represented in Figure 12. As shown in Figure 12, VEGFrl site 4229 active siNA (RPI 29695/29699) at three concentrations were effective at inhibiting angiogenesis compared to the inverted siNA control (RPI 2983/29984) and the VEGF control. A chemically modified version of the VEGFrl site 4229 active siNA comprising a sense strand having 2 '-deoxy-2 '-fluoro pyrimidines and ribo purines with 5' and 3' terminal inverted deoxyabasic residues (RPI 30196) and an antisense strand having having 2'-deoxy- 2 '-fluoro pyrimidines and ribo purines with a terminal 3 '-phosphorothioate internucleotide linkage (RPI 30416), showed similar inhibition. (Data not shown) This result shows siNA \n\nmolecules of differing chemically modified composition of the invention are capable of significantly inhibiting angiogenesis in vivo.</p>Example 10: RNAi mediated inhibition of VEGF and/or VEGFr RNA expression</p>siNA constracts (Table III) are tested for efficacy in reducing VEGF and/or VEGFr RNA expression in, for example, HUVEC, HMVEC, or A375 cells. Cells are plated approximately 24h before transfection in 96-well plates at 5,000-7,500 cells/well, 100 \u03bcl/well, such that at the time of transfection cells are 70-90% confluent. For transfection, annealed siNAs are mixed with the transfection reagent (Lipofectamine 2000, Invitrogen) in a volume of 50 \u03bcl/well and incubated for 20 min. at room temperature. The siNA fransfection mixtures are added to cells to give a final siNA concentration of 25 nM in a volume of 150 \u03bcl. Each siNA transfection mixture is added to 3 wells for triplicate siNA treatments. Cells are incubated at 37\u00b0 for 24h in the continued presence of the siNA transfection mixture. At 24h, RNA is prepared from each well of freated cells. The supematants with the fransfection mixtures are first removed and discarded, then the cells are lysed and RNA prepared from each well. Target gene expression following treatment is evaluated by RT-PCR for the target gene and for a control gene (36B4, an RNA polymerase subunit) for normalization. The triplicate data is averaged and the standard deviations determined for each treatment. Normalized data are graphed and the percent reduction of target mRNA by active siNAs in comparison to their respective inverted control siNAs is determined.</p>Figure 13 shows a non-limiting example of redu"
