    "ed in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, immortalized cells. For example, if the parental cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (\"HAT medium\"), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT- deficient cells.</p>[073] Preferred immortalized cell lines are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high level expression of antibody by the selected antibody -producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. More preferred immortalized cell lines are murine myeloma lines, which can be obtained, for instance, from the SaIk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif, and the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies. (See Kozbor, J. Immunol., 133:3001 (1984); Brodeur et al, Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, (1987) pp. 51-63)).</p>[074] The culture medium in which the hybridoma cells are cultured can then be assayed for the presence of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. The binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by the hybridoma cells may then be determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Such techniques and assays are known in the art. The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson and Pollard, Anal. Biochem., 107:220 (1980). Moreover, in therapeutic applications of monoclonal antibodies, it is important to identify antibodies having a high degree of specificity and a high binding affinity for the target antigen. [075] After the desired hybridoma cells are identified, the clones can be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods. (See Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, Academic Press, (1986) pp. 59-103). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium and RPMI- 1640 medium. Alternatively, the hybridoma cells can be grown in vivo as ascites in a mammal. \n\n [076] The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones can be isolated or purified from the culture medium or ascites fluid by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography. [077] Monoclonal antibodies can also be made by recombinant DNA methods, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567. DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies as provided herein can be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional proc",

Also provided are methods of indentifying compounds useful to treat SARS- CoV infection. The invention also encompasses compounds identified using the screening assays described herein.</p>[0121] For example, the invention provides assays for screening candidate or test compounds which modulate the interaction between SARS-CoV and its receptor, ACE2. The test compounds provided herein can be obtained using any of the numerous approaches in combinatorial library methods known in the art, including: biological libraries; spatially addressable parallel solid phase or solution phase libraries; synthetic library methods requiring deconvolution; the \"one-bead one- compound\" library method; and synthetic library methods using affinity chromatography selection. The biological library approach is limited to peptide libraries, while the other four approaches are applicable to peptide, non-peptide oligomer or small molecule libraries of compounds. (See, e.g., Lam, 1997. Anticancer Drug Design 12: 145). \n\n [0122] A \"small molecule\" as used herein, is meant to refer to a composition that has a molecular weight of less than about 5 kD and typically less than about 4 kD. Small molecules can be, e.g., nucleic acids, peptides, polypeptides, peptidomimetics, carbohydrates, lipids or other organic or inorganic molecules. Libraries of chemical and/or biological mixtures, such as fungal, bacterial, or algal extracts, are known in the art and can be screened with any of the assays provided herein.</p>[0123] Examples of methods for the synthesis of molecular libraries can be found in the art, for example in: DeWitt, et al, 1993. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90: 6909; Erb, et al, 1994. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 91 : 11422; Zuckermann, et al, 1994. J. Med. Chem. 37: 2678; Cho, et al, 1993.

    "-CoV S specific mAbs and a control mAb (D2.2) specific for diphtheria toxin, were used for further study.</p>[0178] Neutralization assay. Mab neutralizing titers were determined by either micro neutralization assay or plaque reduction neutralization titer assay (PRNT50%) (39). For the micro neutralization assay, mAbs were serially diluted two-fold, and incubated with 100 pfu of the different icSARS-CoV strains for 1 h at 37<sup>0</sup>C. Virus and antibodies were then added to a 96-well plate with 5 x 10<sup>3</sup> Vero E6/well in 5 wells per antibody dilution. Wells were checked for cytopathic effect (CPE) at 4-5 days post infection and 50% neutralization titer was determined as the mAb concentration at which at least 50% of wells showed no CPE. For the PRNT50%, mAbs were serially diluted two-fold, and incubated with 100 pfu of the different icSARS-CoV strains for 1 h at 37<sup>0</sup>C. Virus and antibodies were then added to a 6-well plate with 5 x 10<sup>5</sup> Vero E6/well in duplicate. After a 1 h incubation period at 37<sup>0</sup>C, cells were overlayed with 3 ml of 0.8% agarose in media. Plates were incubated for 2 days at 37<sup>0</sup>C, stained with neutral red for 3 h and plaques were counted. The percentage of neutralization was calculated as: 1 -(number of plaques with antibody / number of plaques without antibody) x 100%. All assays were performed in duplicate. Importantly, a good correlation has been noted between the two assays (data not shown). \n\n [0179] Inhibition of binding of SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein to ACE-2.</p>Serial dilutions of mAbs in PBS- 1% FCS were incubated for 20 min at 4\u00b0C with 5 \u03bcg/ml SARS-CoV S glycoprotein (Sl domain amino acids 19-713 of WH20 isolate [99.8% amino acid homology with Urbani; AY772062) fused to the F<sub>c</sub> region of human Ig (Aalto Bio Reagents, Dublin, Ireland). The mixture was added to a single cell suspension of 4 x 10<sup>4</sup> ACE-2-transfected DBT cells that had been sorted for stable and relatively uniform levels of ACE2 expression. After 20 min the cells were washed and stained with PE-conjugated F(ab')<sub>2</sub> fragments of a goat anti human F<sub>c \u03b3</sub> specific antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). The percentage of binding inhibition was calculated accordingly to the following formula where the B<sub>max</sub> is represented by the average of six wells: (1 - (% positive events of the sample/B<sub>max</sub> %) x 100%. The concentration of the antibody needed to achieve 50% of binding inhibition (IC50) was calculated with GraphPad Prism software using a non-linear regression fitting with variable slope.</p>[0180] Detection of human mAbs. Reactivity of mAbs with native or denatured Urbani S recombinant protein was determined by ELISA. Briefly, 96 well plates were coated with 1 \u03bcg/ml of recombinant Urbani S glycoprotein (NR-686; NIH Biodefense and Emerging Infections Research Resources Repository, NIAID, NIH). Wells were washed and blocked with 5% non-fat milk for 1 h 37 <sup>0</sup>C and incubated with serially diluted mAbs for 1.5 h at 37<sup>0</sup>C. Bound mAbs were detected by incubating alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (A- 1543; Sigma) for 1 h at 37<sup>0</sup>C and developed by lmg/ml p-nitrophenylphosphate substrate in 0.1 M glycine buffer (pH 10.4) for 30 min at room temperature. The optical density (OD) values were measured at a wavelength of 405 nm in an ELISA reader (Bio-Rad Model 680).</p>[0181] Competition for binding to SARS-CoV S glycoprotein. MAbs were purified on Protein G columns (GE Healthcare) and biotinylated using the EZ-Link NHS-PEO solid phase biotinylation kit (Pierce). An ELISA assay was used as described above to measure the competition between unlabeled and biotinylated mAbs for binding to immobilized SARS-CoV S glycoprotein. Unlabelled competitor mAbs were added at 5 \u03bcg/ml. After 1 h biotinylated mAbs were added at a limiting concentration (0.1 \u03bcg/ml) that was chosen to give a net optical density \n\n in the linear part of the titration curve, allowing inhibitory effects of the unlabelled mAb to be quantitated. After incubation for 1 h, the plates were washed and the amount of biotinylated mAb bound was detected using alkaline phosphatase-labeled streptavidin (Jackson Immunoresearch). The percentage of inhibition was calculated with the means of triplicate tests using the following formula (1 - [(OD<sub>sample</sub>-OD<sub>neg ctr</sub>)/(OD<sub>pos ctr</sub> - OD<sub>neg ctr</sub>)]) x 100%.</p>[0182] Escape mutant analysis. Neutralization resistant SARS-CoV mutants were generated as described previously (Rockx et al, 2007, J. Virol. 81 : 7410- 7423). Briefly, 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> pfu of icUrbani and GZ02 were incubated with 30 \u03bcg of a neutralizing mAb and then inoculated onto cells in the presence of mAb. The icHC/SZ/61/03 isolate was used for generating a neutralization escape mutant for mAb S227.14, as several attempts to generate escape mutants from this antibody using icUrbani or icGZ02 proved unsuccessful. The development of cytopathic effect (CPE) was monitored over 72 hrs and progeny viruses harvested. MAb treatment was repeated two additional times with more rapid CPE noted with each passage. Passage 3 viruses were plaque purified in the presence of mAb and neutralization resistant viruses were isolated. The S gene of at least two individual plaques was sequenced as previously described (34) and the neutralization titers between wild type and mAb-resistant viruses were determined as described above. [0183] Structural Analyses. The crystal structure coordinates of SARS-CoV RBD interacting with the human ACE-2 receptor (PDB code 2AJF) (23) were used as a template to generate each set of mutations using the Rosetta Design web server (http://rosettadesign.med.unc.edu/).",
    "ent in \n\n neutralizing the human isolates as well as the palm civet isolate icHC/SZ/61/03. It is likely that two or more neutralizing epitopes exist within this cluster as some mAbs were equally efficient at neutralizing human and zoonotic isolates (e.g. 225.12, 226.10, 234.6) while others required 10 fold antibody to neutralize the civet isolate (e.g. 218.9, 231.19, 232.17). The group V cluster consisted of two mAbs that neutralized variable subsets of the human and zoonotic strains but only at high concentrations. Finally group VI consisted of four mAbs that neutralized all human and zoonotic strains available within our panel of variant SARS-CoV spike variants. Because of the varying concentrations of antibody needed to neutralize isolates for each monoclonal antibody in group VI, we suspected that at least two or three different pan specific neutralizing epitopes likely exist in the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein. See results in Table 3, below.</p>Example 3</p>[0190] Identification of mAbs that inhibit binding of SARS-CoV S glycoprotein to ACE-2. To identify the mAbs that directly inhibit the binding of SARS-CoV to its cellular receptor ACE-2 as a mechanism of neutralization, we assessed the capacity of the mAb panel described above to inhibit the binding of the SARS-CoV S 1 domain to human ACE-2 expressed on the surface of a transfected murine DBT cell line. The antibody activity is expressed as the concentration that blocks 50% of spike binding to ACE-2 as well as the maximum inhibition values (Table 3). Most of the antibodies completely inhibited binding, although with different potencies (Table 3; see for example S230 and S3.1). Of note, some antibodies only partially inhibited binding of the spike protein even when tested at the highest concentrations (see for example S124.6, S109.8). Not surprisingly a significant correlation was observed between neutralization titers and inhibition titers of SARS-CoV S glycoprotein binding to ACE-2 (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.344; p=0.002). However a few antibodies such as S3.1 and S127.6 showed a high viral neutralization capacity in spite of a low capacity to interfere with spike binding to its receptor (Table 3).</p>[0191] Results of the SARS human mAbs cross-neutralization and SARS- CoV/ACE-2 binding inhibition assays are shown in the following Table 3. \n\n Table 3</p>Inhibition of SARS-CoV S</p>50% Neutralization titer (ng/ml) binding to ACE-2</p>Group mAb Urbanl CUHK-W1 GZ02 HC/SZ/61/03 A031G GZ02-109-1 GZ02-109-2 GZ02-230 % inhibition IC50 (ng/ml)</p>I 132 1984 - - - - nt nt nt 60 2570</p>228.11 196 - - - - nt nt nt 97 598</p>Il 111.7 154 1232 - - - nt nt nt 96 1208</p>224.17 194 1552 - - - nt nt nt 98 297</p>III 3,1 45 180 720 - - nt nt nt 96 868</p>127.6 65 259 518 - - nt nt nt 97 876</p>217.4 30 59 118 - - nt nt nt 99 114</p>222.1 51 202 808 - - nt nt nt 98 98</p>237.1 8 67 34 - - nt nt nt 97 66</p>IV 110.4 81 322 644 1288 - nt nt nt 99 476</p>218.9 31 123 246 1968 - nt nt nt 101 280</p>223.4 20 79 158 316 - nt nt nt 99 112</p>225.12 9 18 72 72 - nt nt nt 99 68</p>226.10 23 90 360 180 - nt nt nt 99 92</p>231.19 18 71 141 2256 - nt nt nt 99 120</p>232.17 90 180 360 2880 - nt nt nt 100 95</p>234.6 64 2032 254 254 - nt nt nt 100 142</p>V 124.5 1400 5600 - 1120 5600 nt nt nt 56 4700</p>219.2 248 992 - - 496 nt nt nt 44 &gt; 3000</p>Vl 109.8 424 848 3392 424 53 - - 3300 85 525</p>215.17 25 100 200 400 3200 nt nt nt 98 200</p>227.14 19 77 153 306 77 150 150 150 100 126</p>230.15 20 40 160 160 80 155 155 - 99 84</p>[0192] Table 3 Legend. Characterization of a panel of human mAbs for their capacity to neutralize human and zoonotic SARS-CoV strains and inhibit SARS- CoV S glycoprotein binding to human ACE-2. A panel of 23 human mAbs were tested for their capacity to neutralize recombinant SARS-CoV S glycoprotein variants (Urbani, CUHK-Wl, GZ02, HC/SZ/61/03 and A031G) and neutralization escape variants (GZ02-109-1, GZ02-109-2 and GZ02-230) by human mAbs were determined. MAbs are ranked in 6 groups according to their capacity to neutralize different SARS-CoV S glycoprotein variants. The mAb concentration, at which 50% of the viruses is neutralized, is shown (ng/ml). In addition the percentage (%) of maximal inhibition of SARS-CoV S glycoprotein binding to human ACE-2, expressed by murine DBT cells, by the mAbs is shown along with the concentration at which 50% of the binding is blocked (IC50). \" - \" no neutralizing titer detected; \"nt:\" not tested.</p>Example 4</p>[0193] Phylogenetic analysis of viral neutralization. By using a panel of S glycoprotein variants, the amino acid changes associated with loss of neutralization \n\n can be identified. To identify possible locations of neutralizing epitopes recognized by these mAbs, the neutralization groups were annotated in accordance with the amino acid sequences variation noted in the different S glycoproteins used in this study (Fig. IA). Interestingly group I mAbs S132 and S228.11 uniquely neutralized icUrbani which differs at positions G77D and I244T in the S 1 domain from the resistant middle phase isolate icCUHK-Wl (Fig. IA). Although the mechanism is unclear, these two unique residues in icUrbani either individually or in concert result in a) micro variation within overlapping epitopes, b) changes in conformational epitopes, or c) mutations which alter the surface topology of a group I epitope. Consonant with these findings, four amino acid changes (Fig. IA) were observed between the middle phase icCUHK-Wl and the early phase icGZ02 S glycoprotein. The fact that group II antibodies efficiently inhibit RBD binding to ACE-2 implies that the critical residues are likely those residing within the RBD (e.g. G31 IR and K344R). In contrast, the mutations that influence the binding and activity of the group III mAbs are the most complex and influenced by one or more of 15 amino acid changes between the early icGZ02 and the zoonotic palm civet icHC/SZ/61/03 isolate. These changes are scattered throughout the Sl, RBD and S2 domains (Fig. IA), however all group III antibodies efficiently inhibit RBD binding to ACE-2 suggesting that the critical residues are those residing within the RBD. The RBD residues include F360, L472, N479 and D480. The neutralization activity of the group IV mAbs cluster is heavily influenced by two amino acid changes between the zoonotic strains icHC/SZ/61/03 and the raccoon dog isolate, icA031G, located in the RBD (P462S) or in an S2 (E821Q) domain of the S glycoprotein (Fig. IA). Again, the efficient inhibition of RBD binding to the ACE-2 suggests that the P462S is the critical residue. The recognition domain of the group VI broad spectrum antibodies must be conserved across the panel and the location is unclear, although S230.15 has been previously shown to bind to the RBD in the S glycoprotein (60) by competition ELISA and all the group VI mAbs have been shown to interfere with the binding to ACE-2 expressed on the surface of the cell membrane.</p>Example 5</p>[0194] Competition studies for the definition of epitopes recognized by broadly neutralizing mAbs. Our data suggests that the majority of the human \n\n mAbs recognize epitopes differentially defined by a few mutations within the RBD. To provide a more thorough understanding of the binding domains recognized by different monoclonal antibodies, competition studies were performed to determine the spatial proximity of each of the neutralizing epitopes recognized by representative mAbs. Several mAbs, S 109.8, S227.14 and S230.15 (group VI), were biotinylated and tested for their capacity to bind the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein in the presence of other unlabeled mAbs. In interpreting competition results, it should be taken into account that when two epitopes overlap, or when the areas covered by the arms of the two mAbs overlap, competition should be almost complete. Weak inhibitory or enhancing effects may simply reflect a decrease in affinity owing to steric or allosteric effects (29, 51). The two most potent cross- neutralizing mAbs S227.14 and S230.15 compete with each other (Fig. IB) and with several other mAbs with the exception of the group I mAbs (S 138 and S228. l l), group V mAbs (S124.5 and S219.2), S3.1 (group III) and S109.8 (group VI). The S230.15 mAb has a higher affinity than the S227.14 mAb since it competes with the S227.14 mAb at a 16 fold lower concentration than that required for the S227.14 mAb to compete with S230.15 (46 ng/ml and 738 ng/ml, respectively). The S 109.8 mAb did not compete with any of the mAbs, although limited inhibition was seen with S127.6 (61%; Fig. IB).</p>Example 6</p>[0195] Escape mutant analysis of neutralizing mAbs. We previously used the icGZ02 isolate to successfully generate neutralization escape mutants for two broadly neutralizing mAbs S 109.8 and S230.15, which selected for escape mutations at positions T332I or K333N, and L443R respectively (Rockx et al, 2008, J. Virol. 82: 3220). However, the use of this isolate limits the number of mAbs that could be used for these escape analyses. Therefore, the icUrbani isolate was used to generate antibody neutralization escape mutants by incubating and culturing high titers of virus in the presence of selected mAbs chosen from the five distinct neutralization groups previously described by our group. After 3 passages, the resulting viruses were plaque purified and 2 plaques of each virus were sequenced to identify the amino acid changes associated with the antibody escape phenotype. \n\n [0196] The S109.8 escape mutant of icGZ02 was no longer neutralized by S109.8 compared to the wild type (WT) icGZ02 even at antibodies exceeding 20 \u03bcg/ml (Table 3). However both S227.14 and S230.15 were equally effective at neutralizing the S109.8 escape mutant of icGZ02 as compared to the WT. [0197] Similarly the S230.15 escape mutant was no longer neutralized by S230.15 but was still effectively neutralized by both S 109.8 and S227.14 mAbs (Table 3). This was particularly interesting since S227.14 was shown to compete with S230.15 for binding t",

Finally, in agreement with the morbidity data, postinfection treatment only showed a clear reduction in pathologic changes when treated one day prior to (Fig. 7D) or on the day of infection (Fig. 8A) but not on days 1, 2 or 3 post infection (Fig. 8B, C and D respectively). [0212] No evidence of enhanced disease or pathology was observed with any of the mAb and any of the challenge viruses.</p>References</p>1. Aw, D. et al, 2007.
