(Merck Manual, 15th Edition, (Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Research Laboratories, R. Berkow, Editor) 1355-1366  (1987). Further descriptions of the symptoms include possible associated nausea, photophobia, throbbing, unilaterally and involuntary vomiting.</p>In order to exhibit an anti-migraine effect, it is necessary that the compounds be administered to the patient in an effective amount. The dosage range at which these compounds exhibit this migraine prophylactic effect can vary widely depending upon the severity of the patient's depression, the particular compound being administered, the route of administration, the co-administration of other therapeutic agents, and the presence of other underlying disease states. Typically, the compounds will be administered at a dosage range of from 0.1 mg/kg/day to about 100 mg/kg/day. Repetitive daily administration may be desirable and will vary with the conditions described above. However, the compounds are typically administered from 1 to 4 times daily.</p>The affinity of the compounds for the 5HT<sub>1C</sub> receptor can be demonstrated by receptor binding assay procedures which are known in the art. The affinity of compounds for the 5HT<sub>1C</sub> receptor has also been demonstrated by receptor binding assay procedures which are disclosed by Hartig et al. Ann N.Y. Acad. Sci 600, 149 (1990) and Canton, et al. Eur. J. Pharm. 191, 93-96 (1990).</p>Binding of the natural ligand to the 5HT<sub>1C</sub> receptor leads to the production of second messengers, such as phosphatidylinositol and diacylglycerol. Use of assays for second messengers can be used to characterize the agonistic or antagonistic properties of agents that bind the 5HT<sub>1C</sub> receptor. Furthermore, such assays when coupled with the knowledge of the target cell type can lead one to claim their potential role as therapeutic agents.</p>In order to exhibit an anti-depressant effect, it is necessary that the compounds be administered to the patient in an effective amount. The dosage range at which these compounds exhibit this anti-depressant effect can vary widely depending upon the severity of the patient's depression, the particular compound being administered, the route of administration, the co-administration of other therapeutic agents, and the presence of other underlying disease states.

Total membrane-bound radioactivity is about 3% of that added to the test tubes. Since these conditions limit total binding to less than 10% of the radioactivity, the concentration of free ligand does not change appreciably during the binding assay. Specific binding to membranes is about 70% of the total bound.
