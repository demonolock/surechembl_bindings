    "blotting with anti-HuGRF antisera. Authentic HuGRF (S) is compared to HuGRF<sub>Leu27</sub> purified from two lots of TrpLE-BssH II-HuGRF<sub>Leu27</sub> (lanes 1, 2) and TrpLE-Sst II-HuGRF<sub>Leu27</sub> (lane 3). Unmarked lanes contain molecular weight standards.Figure 10 depicts the HPLC profiles of lots 1, 2, and 3 described in Figure 9.Figure 11 is a map of the AIDS virus genome illustrating the locations of the specific clones described in relation to the major open reading frames of the virus (GAG, POL, ENV, A, and B).Figure 12 illustrates a reference pattern of TrpLE-AIDS fusion proteins and AIDS virus infected cells (BAG) visualized by western blotting with a pool of sera from three AIDS patients.Figure 13 illustrates results from the western blotting analysis of 19 human serum samples. Each serum sample was used to probe the various TrpLE-AIDS fusion proteins (GAG, POL, ENV), the TrpLE vector without an insert (VECTOR), and AIDS virus infected cells (AIDS). The numbers above each panel indicate the number of positively reacting serum samples.Figure 14 illustrates Western blot results comparing the immunoreactivity of CNBr treated LE-GAG fusion proteins generated by pSB8-Gag-#25 with LE-ENV fusion proteins produced by pTrpLE-KAL-ENV-#10.Figure 15A shows an SDS-polyacrylamide gel stained with Coomasie Blue stain showing the proteins produced by pSB12-854AHB. Figure 15B depicts western blot analysis of the same E. coli extracts of pSB-854AHB demonstrating that the 35 Kd protein is the only immunoreactive protein entity.Figures 16A and 16B depict the HPLC fractionation and western blot analysis of the CNBr-cleaved fragments obtained in Example 16.</p>One aspect of the invention is a bacterial expression vector for the expression of fusion proteins, which vector comprises a TrpLE DNA gene fragment and a heterologous DNA sequence. A preferred subgenus is the vector which further comprises a three-frame linker segment between said TrpLE fragment and said heterologous DNA sequence. A preferred class of the invention is the vector which further comprises a cleavable linker sequence between said TrpLE fragment and said heterologous DNA sequence, especially where said cleavable linker encodes Met, Asp-Pro, or Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys. A preferred subclass is the vector wherein said heterologous DNA sequence encodes: human, bovine, or porcine growth hormone releasing factor or a biologically active derivative or fragment thereof; an antigenic viral protein or a biologically active derivative or fragment thereof; or a growth factor or hormone or a biologically active derivative or fragment thereof. A preferred species is the vector encoding an antigenic viral protein in which the antigenic viral protein is an AIDS protein, particularly an ENV polypeptide, and especially the polypeptide KAL-10. Another preferred species is that wherein the antigenic viral protein is a pre-S sequence of the surface antigen of HBV (hepatitis B virus). Another preferred spe",
    "Br treatment of LE-GAG fusion proteins generated by pSB8-Gag-#25 completely destroyed any immunoreactive epitope, similar chemical treatment of LE-ENV fusion proteins produced by pTrpLE-KAL-ENV-#10 resulted in peptides that retained strong immunoreactivity (Figure 14). In fact, these peptides appear to react with anti-AIDS sera somewhat stronger immunologically than the intact fusion proteins.</p>EXAMPLE 16Construction of High-Expression ENV CloneThe above results suggested that deletion mutants of Kal-10 which retain the coding sequences for important antigenic domains would be useful for diagnostic applications. Deletion of extraneous gene sequences, such as those that code for membrane binding domains, often result in progeny clones that are capable of synthesizing proteins of interest to a higher level.</p>Following this principle, we constructed a new plasmid (designated pENV-854AHB) as follows:\nAn 854 bp Bgl I I to BamH I fragment of pTrpLE-KAL-ENV-#10 was first cloned into the unique BamH I site of plasmid pSBl2, yielding plasmid pSB12-854. Plasmid pSB12-854 DNA was further cleaved with Hind III and BamH I. The 5' overhangs were then filled using Klenow fragment and the resulting blunt ends recircularized using T4 ligase to produce the sequence AAGCTGATCC. The translational termination codon (TGA) generated by this process terminates the LE-ENV fusion protein at the Hind III-BamH I fusion site. The progeny transformant, pSB12-854AHB produced on induction a discrete 35 Kd polypeptide to more than 5% of the total cellular protein, as observed on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel stained with Coomasie Blue (Figure 15A). Western blot analysis of the total E. coli extract of pSB-854AHB verified that the 35 Kd protein was the only immunoreactive protein entity (Figure 15B).</p>The 35 Kd protein was subjected to CNBr cleavage, following the procedure set forth above. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the resulting polypeptide fragments retain excellent immunoreactivity with anti-AIDS antibodies.</p>EXAMPLE 17HPLC Fractionation of CNBr-ENV Peptide FragmentsThe CNBr-cleaved fragments obtained in Example 16 were applied to a 0.46 x 25 cm HPLC column packed with C18 silica beads (Vydac TP201, N-capped, 5 \u00b5M), which had been washed with 20% solvent B (CH<sub>3</sub>CN + 0.1% CF<sub>3</sub>COOH). Solvent A was 0.1% aqueous CF<sub>3</sub>COOH. The peptide fragments were eluted at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. with a gradient of 20% to 40% solvent B over a period of 30 min., followed by a gradient of 40% to 80% solvent B over an additional 20 min. The column fractions were collected and assayed immunologically by Western blot. The fractions which eluted between 34 and 40 minutes after injection contained immunoreactive ENV fragments (Figures 16A and 16B).</p>EXAMPLE 18Western Blot With AIDS Patient SeraWestern Blot analysis was used to demonstrate the usefulness of the ENV-derived CNBr peptides in detecting anti-AIDS antibodies present in patient sera. Results indicated that, similar to the LE-ENV fusion proteins produced from pTrpLE-KAL-ENV-#10, pSB12-854, and pSB12-854AHB, CNBr fragments of SB12-854AHB served as ideal diagnostic markers for AIDS virus infection.</p>"
