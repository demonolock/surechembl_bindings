Where specific conditions are mentioned, these prevail over the general descriptions presented in the next paragraphs: </p>[0213] Antiproliferative Assays: </p>[0214] Antiproliferative assays are performed as previously described (Int. J. Cancer 43, 851-6 (1989)). Briefly, cells are seeded at 1.5\u00d710<sup>3 </sup>cells/well into 96-well microtiter plates and incubated overnight. Compounds are added in serial dilutions on day 1. The plates are then incubated for an additional 2 to 5 days, allowing for at least one cell doubling (cell line dependent), after which the cells are fixed with 3.3% v/v glutaraldehyde, washed with water and stained with 0.05% w/v methylene blue. After washing, the dye is eluted with 3% V/V HCl and the optical density measured at 665 nm with a SpectraMax 340 (Bucherer, Basel, Switzerland). IC50 values are determined by a computerized system (SoftPro, Bucherer, Basel, Switzerland) using the formula (OD test\u2212OD start)/(OD control\u2212OD start)\u00d7100. IC50 is defined as the drug concentration which leads to 50% of cells per well compared to control cultures (100%) at the end of incubation period. </p>[0215] In Vivo Antitumor Activity Against s.c. Transplanted Tumors </p>[0216] Female or male BALB/c nu/nu (nude) mice are kept under sterile conditions (10 to 12 mice per Type III cage) with free access to food and water. Mice weigh between 20 and 25 grams at the time of tumor implantation. Tumors are established by subcutaneous injection of cells (minimum 2\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>cells in 100 \u03bcl PBS or medium) in carrier mice (4-8 mice per cell line). The resulting tumors are serially passaged for a minimum of three consecutive transplantations prior to start of treatment. Tumor fragments (approx. 25 mg) are implanted s.c. into the left flank of animals with a 13-gauge trocar needle while the mice are exposed to Forene (Abbott, Switzerland) anesthesia. </p>[0217] Tumor growth and body weights are monitored once or twice weekly. All treatments are administered intravenously (i.v.) and are initiated when a mean tumor volume of approximately 100 to 250 mm<sup>3 </sup>is attained, depending upon the tumor type. Tumor volumes are determined using the formula (L\u00d7D\u00d7\u03c0)/6 (see Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 24:148-154, [1989]). Treatments with epothilone B vary the dose and the frequency of administration. Comparator agents are administered according to previously determined optimal treatment regimens. In addition to presenting changes in tumor",
    "on, myeloid hypoplasia in bone marrow and increased hemopoiesis in the spleen are detectable at 10 mg/kg. Slight erythroid and myeloid atrophy of bone marrow is seen at 3 mg/kg. Single cell necrosis is detected in the intestinal mucosa at 3 and 10 mg/kg at the end of the treatment period only. </p>[0239] Conclusions </p>[0240] The most important conclusions emerging from the data summarized in Examples 1 and 2 for the toxicological findings with epothilone B can be summarized as follows: </p>[0241] The MTD for single dose i.v. administration of epothilone B to normal and nude mice from a BALB/c background corresponds to 4 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg, respectively. Nude mice thus are less sensitive to the toxic effects of the compound than normal mice. </p>[0242] In normal mice, two doses of 3 mg/kg given one week apart are reasonably well tolerated and do not cause mortality up to day 43 after the initial dose. The same dosing regimen at a 10 mg/kg dose level results in death (or sacrifice) of all treated animals. </p>Example 3 In Vitro Activity of Epothilones Against Cell Lines [0243] The potent anti-proliferative activity of epothilone B is confirmed for some human cancer cell lines; the results of these experiments are summarized in Table 3. Epothilone B generally exhibits higher potency than paclitaxel, particularly against cancer cells with a multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotype (e.g. KB-8511, HCT-15).  \nTABLE 3In vitro activity of the epothilones against human carcinoma celllines.IC50-values [nM] for growth inhibition of human carcinoma celllines by epothilone B in comparison to paclitaxel (5 d exposure,mean \u00b1 SD, n = 3).Values in parenthesis indicate relative resistance, i.e., IC50 (resistantline)/IC50 (parental line).Cell Lineepothilone BpaclitaxelA549 (Lung)0.19 \u00b1 0.12<sup>a</sup>3.75 \u00b1 0.92ZR-75-1 (Breast)0.64 \u00b1 0.42<sup>\u2002</sup>3.60 \u00b1 1.87HCT-15 (Colon)0.41 \u00b1 0.15<sup>\u2002</sup>106 \u00b1 54\u2002KB-85110.89 \u00b1 0.47<sup>b</sup><sup>\u2002</sup>994 \u00b1 281<sup>b</sup>(Epidermoid, MDR)(1.25)(343)<sup>a</sup>PC-3M (Prostate)3.82 \u00b1 0.47<sup>c</sup><sup>\u2002</sup>6.74 \u00b1 0.72<sup>c</sup>\n</p>Example 4 Antitumor Activity of the Epothilones Against Human Colorectal Adenocarcinoma HCT-15 Tumors [0244] Tumor volumes are used as the primary indicator of activity of antitumor agents used alone or in combination, and changes in body weights are measured as an indicator of treatment tolerability. </p>[0245] As can be deduced from Table 4, a single 4 mg/kg dose of epothilone B is able to produce tumor regressions (p&lt;0.05 vs. vehicle controls; Dunnett's) in drug-resistant, P-gp over-expressing, HCT-15 colon tumors (FIG. 1 and Table 1). This activity is clearly superior to five 20 mg/kg administrations of TAXOL\u00ae or two 75 mg/kg 5-fluorouracil administrations (p&lt;0.05 vs. epothilone B; SNK test). HCT-15 tumors are resistant to both TAXOL\u00ae and 5-fluorouracil, in that final TIC values of 50% and 88%, respectively, are obtained (both p&gt;0.05 vs. controls; Dunnett's). Epothilone B treatment is well tolerated in that body weight is stable under treatment; vehicle-treated mice gain weight. No mortalities due to treatment are observed with epothilone B. In contrast, some mortalities are observed with TAXOL\u00ae"
