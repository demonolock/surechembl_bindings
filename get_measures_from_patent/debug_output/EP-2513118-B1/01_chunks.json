Pharmacological examplesThe compounds provided in the present invention are positive allosteric modulators of mGluR5. These compounds appear to potentiate glutamate responses by binding to an allosteric site other than the glutamate binding site. The response of mGluR5 to a concentration of glutamate is increased when compounds of Formula (I) are present. Compounds of Formula (I) are expected to have their effect substantially at mGluR5 by virtue of their ability to enhance the function of the receptor. The behaviour of positive allosteric modulators tested at mGluR5 using the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization binding assay method described below and which is suitable for the identification of such compounds.</p>In brief, the human mGluR5 receptor was stably expressed in HEK-293 cells and grown at a density of 40,000 cells/well in PDL-coated 384-well plates. Cells were preloaded with the calcium-sensing dye Fluo-4 AM and various concentrations of test compound were added in the absence of exogenous glutamate to test for direct agonist activity. Shortly (2.5 min) thereafter, an EC<sub>20</sub> equivalent of glutamate (\u223c0.2 \u00b5M) was added. The fluorescence signal was monitored using a Hamamatsu Functional Drug Screening System (FDSS) fluorescence plate reader following the addition of compound alone (direct agonist response) and then the further addition of an EC<sub>20</sub> of glutamate (positive allosteric modulation response). The pEC<sub>50</sub> was defined as the negative log of the test compound concentration which produced an increase in the glutamate EC<sub>20</sub>-mediated response that was 50% of maximum. Individual amplitudes were expressed as %effect by multiplying each amplitude by 100 and then dividing the product by the mean of the amplitudes derived from the glutamate EC<sub>Max</sub>-treated wells. E<sub>max</sub> values reported in this application are defined as the maximum %effect obtained in a concentration-response curve.\nTable 4: Pharmacological data for compounds according to the inventionCo.
