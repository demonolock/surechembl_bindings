{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\nAntibodies typically bind specifically to their cognate antigen with high affinity, reflected by a dissociation constant (KD) of 10-5 to 10-11 M-l or less.\nAs used herein, an Ab that \u201cbinds specifically\u201d to an antigen refers to an Ab that binds to the antigen and substantially identical antigens with high affinity, which means having a KD of 10-7 M or less, preferably 10-8 M or less, even more preferably 5x 10-9 M or less, and most preferably between 10-8 M and 10-10 M or less, but does not bind with high \nAny KD greater than about 10-4 M-l is generally considered to indicate nonspecific binding."}
