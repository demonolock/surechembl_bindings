    " (Ab) shall include, without limitation, a glycoprotein immunoglobulin which binds specifically to an antigen and comprises at least two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains interconnected by disulfide bonds, or an antigenbinding portion thereof. Each H chain comprises a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VH) and a heavy chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region comprises three constant domains, CHI, CH2 and CH3. Each light chain comprises a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VL) and a light chain constant region. The light chain constant region is comprises one constant domain, CL. The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions (CDRs), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each VH and VL comprises three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy -terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. The variable regions of the heavy and light chains contain a binding domain that interacts with an antigen. The constant regions of the Abs may mediate the binding of the immunoglobulin to host tissues or factors, including various cells of the immune system (e.g., effector cells) and the first component (Clq) of the classical complement system. </p><p id=\"p0133\" num=\"0133\">[0130] Antibodies typically bind specifically to their cognate antigen with high affinity, reflected by a dissociation constant (KD) of 10-5 to 10-11 M-l or less. Any KD greater than about 10-4 M-l is generally considered to indicate nonspecific binding. As used herein, an Ab that \u201cbinds specifically\u201d to an antigen refers to an Ab that binds to the antigen and substantially identical antigens with high affinity, which means having a KD of 10-7 M or less, preferably 10-8 M or less, even more preferably 5x 10-9 M or less, and most preferably between 10-8 M and 10-10 M or less, but does not bind with high \n<!-- EPO <DP n=\"20\"/>-->\n affinity to unrelated antigens. An antigen is \u201csubstantially identical\u201d to a given antigen if it exhibits a high degree of sequence identity to the given antigen, for example, if it exhibits at least 80%, at least 90%, preferably at least 95%, more preferably at least 97%, or even more preferably at least 99% sequence identity to the sequence of the given antigen. </p><p id=\"p0134\" num=\"0134\">[0131] An immunoglobulin can derive from any of the commonly known isotypes, including but not limited to IgA, secretory IgA, IgG and IgM. IgG subclasses are also well known to those in the art and include but are not limited to human IgGl, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4. \u201cIsotype\u201d refers to the Ab class or subclass (e.g., IgM or IgGl) that is encoded by the heavy chain constant region genes. The term \u201cantibody\u201d includes, by way of example, both naturally occurring and non-naturally occurring Abs; monoclonal and polyclonal Abs; chimeric and humanized Abs; human or nonhuman Abs; wholly synthetic Abs; and single chain Abs. A nonhuman Ab may be humanized by recombinant methods to reduce its immunogenicity in man. Where not expressly stated, and unless the context indicates otherwise, the term \u201cantibody\u201d also includes an antigen-binding fragment or an antigen-binding portion of any of the aforementioned im"
