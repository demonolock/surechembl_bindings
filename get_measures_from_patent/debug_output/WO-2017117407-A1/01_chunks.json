    "were generated by eluting the ERT with \n\n increasing amount of salt. The profiles were monitored by UV (A280nm). ATB200 rhGAA was obtained from CHO cells and purified. Lumizyme\u00ae was obtained from a commercial source. Lumizyme\u00ae exhibited a high peak on the left of its elution profile. ATB200 rhGAA exhibited four prominent peaks eluting to the right of Lumizyme\u00ae (Figure 6). This confirms that ATB200 rhGAA was phosphorylated to a greater extent than Lumizyme\u00ae since this evaluation is by terminal charge rather than CIMPR affinity. </p>Example 5: Oligosaccharide Characterization of ATB200 rhGAA </p> Purified ATB200 rhGAA and Lumizyme\u00ae glycans were evaluated by MALDI-TOF to determine the individual glycan structures found on each ERT (Figure 7). ATB200 samples were found to contain lower amounts of non-phosphorylated high-mannose type N-glycans than </p>Lumizyme\u00ae. The higher content of M6P glycans in ATB200 than in Lumizyme\u00ae, targets ATB200 rhGAA to muscle cells more effectively. The high percentage of mono- phosphorylated and bis-phosphorylated structures determined by MALDI agree with the CIMPR profiles which illustrated significantly greater binding of ATB200 to the CIMPR receptor. N-glycan analysis via MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry confirmed that on average each ATB200 molecule contains at least one natural bis-M6P N-glycan structure. This higher bis-M6P N-glycan content on ATB200 rhGAA directly correlated with high-affinity binding to CIMPR in M6P receptor plate binding assays (KD about 2-4 nM) Figure 9A. </p>ATB200 rhGAA was also analyzed for site-specific N-glycan profiles using two different LC- MS/MS analytical techniques. In the first analysis, the protein was denatured, reduced, alkylated and digested prior to LC-MS/MS analysis. During protein denaturation and reduction, 200 \u03bcg of protein sample, 5 \u03bc\u03af 1 mol/L tris-HCI (final concentration 50mM), 75 \u03bc\u03af 8 mol/L guanidine HCI (final concentration 6 M), 1 \u03bc\u03af 0.5 mol/L EDTA (final concentration 5 imM), 2 \u03bc\u03af 1 mol/L DTT (final concentration 20 imM) and Milli-Q\u00ae water were added to a 1 .5 imL tube to provide a total volume of 100 \u03bc\u03af. The sample was mixed and incubated at 56 \u00b0C for 30 minutes in a dry bath. During alkylation, the denatured and reduced protein sample was mixed with 5 \u03bc\u03af 1 mol/L iodoacetamide (IAM, final concentration 50 imM), then incubated at 10-30\u038c in the dark for 30 minutes. After alkylation, 400 \u03bc\u03af of precooled acetone was added to the sample and the mixture was frozen at -80 \u00b0C refrigeration for 4 hours. The sample was then centrifuged for 5 min at 13000 rpm at 4\u00b0C and the supernatant was removed. 400 \u03bc\u03af of precooled acetone was added to the pellets, which was then centrifuged for 5 min at 13000 rpm at 4\u00b0C and the supernatant was removed. The sample was then air dried on ice in the dark to remove acetone residue. 40 \u03bc\u03af of 8M urea and 160 \u03bc\u03af of 100 imM NH<sub>4</sub>HC0<sub>3</sub>were \n\n added to the sample to dissolve the protein. During trypsin digestion, 50 \u03bcg of the protein wa",

Both the first and second analyses also detected over 25% of the ATB200 had a mono-M6P glycan at the fourth site. </p> Figure 8F shows the N-glycosylation profile of the fifth site, N596. As can be seen from Figure 8F, the major glycan species are fucosylated di-antennary complex glycans. Both the first and second analyses detected over 70% of the ATB200 had a sialic acid residue at the fifth site.</p>Figure 8G shows the N-glycosylation profile of the sixth site, N826. As can be seen from Figure 8G, the major glycan species are di-, tri-, and tetra-antennary complex glycans. Both the first and second analyses detected over 80% of the ATB200 had a sialic acid residue at the sixth site. </p> Figure 8H shows a summary of the phosphorylation at each of the first six potential N- glycosylation sites. As can be seen from Figure 8H, both the first and second analyses detected high phosphorylation levels at the first, second and fourth sites. Both analyses detected over 80% of the ATB200 was mono- or di-phosphorylated at the first site, over 40% of the ATB200 was mono-phosphorylated at the second site, and over 80% of the ATB200 was mono- or di-phosphorylated at the fourth site. \n\n Example 6: Characterization of CIMPR Affinity of ATB200 </p> In addition to having a greater percentage of rhGAA that can bind to the CIMPR, it is important to understand the quality of that interaction. Lumizyme\u00ae and ATB200 rhGAA receptor binding was determined using a CIMPR plate binding assay. Briefly, CIMPR-coated plates were used to capture GAA. Varying concentrations of rhGAA were applied to the immobilized receptor and unbound rhGAA was washed off. The amount of remaining rhGAA was determined by GAA activity. As shown by Figure 9A, ATB200 rhGAA bound to CIMPR significantly better than Lumizyme\u00ae. </p>Figure 9B shows the relative content of bis-M6P glycans in Lumizyme\u00ae, a conventional rhGAA, and ATB200 according to the invention. For Lumizyme\u00ae there is on average only 10% of molecules have a bis-phosphorylated glycan. Contrast this with ATB200 where on average every rhGAA molecule has at least one bis-phosphorylated glycan. </p>Example 7: ATB200 rhGAA was more efficiently internalized by fibroblast than Lumizyme\u00ae</p>The relative cellular uptake of ATB200 and Lumizyme\u00ae rhGAA were compared using normal and Pompe fibroblast cell lines. Comparisons involved 5-100 nM of ATB200 rhGAA according to the invention with 10-500 nM conventional rhGAA Lumizyme\u00ae. After 16-hr incubation, external rhGAA was inactivated with TRIS base and cells were washed 3-times with PBS prior to harvest. Internalized GAA measured by 4MU-a-Glucoside hydrolysis and was graphed relative to total cellular protein and the results appear in Figures 10A-B. </p> ATB200 rhGAA was also shown to be efficiently internalized into cells (Figure 10A and 10B), respectively, show that ATB200 rhGAA is internalized into both normal and Pompe fibroblast cells and that it is internalized to a greater"
