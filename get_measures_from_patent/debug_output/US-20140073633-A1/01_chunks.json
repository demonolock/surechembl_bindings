    "elong dialysis or a kidney transplant.</p>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides epidemiological figures of the number of incident STEC infections (Mead et al., (1999) Emerg Infect Dis 5, 607-625). Authors evaluated the total number of STEC infections annually to be 110,220 in USA.</p>Shiga toxins belong to the toxins that use the cell retrograde transport; these toxins include ricin (produced in the seeds of the castor oil plant Ricinus communis), Shiga and Shiga-like toxins (Stx1 and Stx2, together designated Stxs, produced by Shigella dysenteriae and E. coli), cholera toxin (Ctx produced by Vibrio cholerae), heat-labile enterotoxin (produced by E. coli), pertussis toxin (produced by Bordetella pertussis), and subtilase cytotoxin (produced by E. coli). These toxins share a similar structural organization: a receptor-binding B-subunit associated with a catalytic active A-subunit.</p>After binding to their target cell receptors, these toxins are internalized and transported to early endosomes (EE). Instead of being recycled back to the plasma membrane or transported to late endosomes/lysosomes for degradation, an important number of toxin molecules gain access to the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), from where their A-subunits are retro-translocated into the cytosol (Sandvig et al. (2002) Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 18:1-24). Then, the A-subunits of Stxs toxins and ricin remove a conserved adenine-residue from ribosomal RNA, leading to an inhibition of protein biosynthesis and apoptosis, whereas the A-subunit of cholera toxin modifies the stimulatory G-protein G<sub>s</sub>\u03b1, causing the untamed, constitutive production of the secondary messenger cAMP, which finally provokes a dramatic efflux of ions and water from the digestive track.</p>The unique intracellular transport pathway of these toxins from the early endosomes to the ER via the Golgi apparatus (retrograde transport) offers the opportunity to search for pharmacologically active compounds capable of blocking this pathway. Small molecules that inhibit the retrograde transport of these toxins would prevent their delivery into the cytosol, where they exert their deadly effect.</p>To date, there is no proven safe treatment for STEC infections and prevention of Shiga toxin-mediated complications other than supportive care. Moreover, the use of antibiotics seems to exacerbate the disease. Considering that Shiga toxin is the major virulence factor secreted by STEC and that Stxs plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of HUS, most treatment strategies aim at neutralizing Stxs.</p>Development of compounds capable of inhibiting the cellular toxin binding targeting the B-subunit of the toxin has been studied leading to a synthetic analog of Shiga toxin receptor, this analog is composed of silicon dioxide particles covalently linked to the trisaccharide moiety (globotriose [\u03b1-D-Gal-(1\u21924)-\u03b2-D-Gal-(1\u21924)-D-Glc]) of the globotriaosylceramide molecule that mediates S",

However, experiments were realized in acellular in vitro assay and the IC50 of Stx1 was shifted by one order of magnitude in presence of 0.8 mM 4-APP. Thus, it appears that therapeutic potential of such compounds is low.</p>Another strategy intends to act directly on cellular processes hijacked by Stxs and not on the toxin itself. In the past, it has been shown for a limited number of small molecules that they are able to inhibit the retrograde transport of certain toxins (Ricin, Shiga and cholera toxins), Exo2 (Spooner et al. (2008) Biochem J 414, 471-484), Brefeldin A (Donta et al., 1995), Golgicide and others (Saenz et al. (2007) Infect Immun 75, 4552-4561; Saenz et al. (2009) Nat Chem Biol 5, 157-165).</p>Yet, these compounds are rather unspecific, as they affect the morphology of cellular compartments. Their effect is thus not restricted to the retrograde transport pathway (the anterograde/biosynthetic transport is affected, too) or to these toxins (the transport of endogenous proteins is affected as well). Treatment is most likely not possible without causing severe side effects.</p>There is thus a need for the development of compounds intended for safe treatment for infections and prevention of Shiga toxin-mediated complications other than supportive care.</p>The inventors have found that unexpectedly the compounds of formula (I) (imine derivatives) and the compounds of formula (II) (benzodiazepine derivatives) are efficient for preventing and/or treating Shiga toxins cells intoxications.</p>The present invention relates to the use of an ",

The following commercial antibodies were utilized in this study: anti-giantin (Abcam), anti-TfR (BD Biosciences), anti-EEA1 (Santa Cruz), anti-Lamp1 (BD Biosciences), anti-GFP (Roche), anti-TGN46 (AbD Serotech), anti-golgin-97 (Invitrogen), anti-GM130 (Santa Cruz), anti-mouse-Alexa488, anti-goat-Alexa488, anti-rabbit-Alexa488 (Molecular Probes), and anti-sheep-Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch).</p>Methods</p>1. HeLa-Cells are Protected Against Stx-Intoxication</p>HeLa-cells were treated with 20 \u03bcM of compounds 161 or 193 before challenging them for 45 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. with increasing doses of Stx1 and Stx2. Protein biosynthesis was determined 1 hour later by measuring the incorporation of radiolabeled methionine into acid-precipitable material.</p>Cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated in PBS containing 20 \u03bcCi/ml <sup>35</sup>S-methionine for 60 min. Labelled proteins were precipitated with 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, the wells were washed three times with PBS and the amount of radiolabel incorporated was determined after the addition of 200 \u03bcl of scintillation fluid, by scintillation counting in a Micro-Beta 1450 Trilux counter.</p>Compound-treated cells are dramatically protected against the intoxication by Stxs. In inhibitor-treated HeLa-cells, 50-100\u00d7 higher doses of Stxs are needed to obtain a similar level of protein biosynthesis inhibition as in control cells (FIG. 1).</p>2. Quantification of the Retrograde Transport Inhibition of Stx to the Trans-Golgi-Network (TGN) I</p>The retrograde transport of StxB to the TGN was quantified by sulfation assay (extensively described by Amessou et al., ((2006) Curr Protoc Cell Biol Chapter 15, Unit 15 10) as early as 20 min and up to 4 h after internalization. For this assay, a StxB variant called StxB-Sulf<sub>2</sub>, which bears a tandem of protein sulfation recognition sites, is internalized in the presence of <sup>35</sup>SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2\u2212</sup>. Upon arrival in the TGN, the TGN-localized sulfotransferase catalyzes the transfer of radioactive sulphate onto StxB-Sulf<sub>2</sub>. After cell lysis, immunoprecipitation, and gel electrophoresis, [<sup>35</sup>S]-sulfated StxB-Sulf<sub>2 </sub>can be detected and quantified by autoradiography.</p>On compounds 161 or 193-treated cells, the retrograde transport of STxB is dramatically reduced (90%) (FIG. 2). Even 4 h after internalization, compounds reduce transport of StxB to the TGN by 50%.</p>3. Transport of Stx and Ctx is Inhibited at the Interface Between Early Endosomes and Golgi Apparatus</p>Immunofluorescence was used to determine at which step the retrograde transport of Stx and Ctx is inhibited. Compound-treated cells were incubated with Cy3-STxB (0.5 \u03bcg/mL) or Alexa488-CTxB (4 \u03bcg/mL) for 30 min on ice, followed by 45 min at 37\u00b0 C. in the continued presence of compounds (20 \u03bcM). Cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde, and stained with compartment-specific antibodies such as EEA1, TfR, Vps2",
    "rograde Transport of Endogenous Cargos (TGN46, CI-M6PR)</p>To characterize the inhibitory effect of compounds on endogenous cargos, the transport of either C1-M6PR or TGN46 was compared between compound-treated and control cells. HeLa-cells over-expressing MPR-GFP were pretreated with 20 \u03bcM of compounds 193 or 161 for 30 min at 37\u00b0 C. (FIG. 10A). After binding of STxB-Cy3, cells were incubated with anti-GFP antibody for 40 min at 37\u00b0 C. During this time, the antibody binds to cell-surface MPR-GFP, and the MPR-GFP/anti-GFP antibody-complex is internalized and transported to the Golgi apparatus, where it colocalizes with Giantin, a Golgi-marker. Note, that in compound-treated cells, where the retrograde transport of STxB to the TGN is inhibited, the MPR-GFP/anti-GFP antibody-complex is still transported efficiently to the Golgi, suggesting that the two compounds are cargo-specific (i.e. no effect on MPR-transport).</p>HeLa-cells were treated for 5.5 h at 37\u00b0 C. with 20 \u03bcM of compounds 193 or 161 (FIGS. 10B and 10C). After binding of STxB-Cy3 on ice, cells were incubated for another 45 min at 37\u00b0 C. in the presence of compounds 193 or 161, fixed and stained for the indicated antibodies. Note that the steady-state localization of CI-MPR and TGN46 is similar under control and compound-treatment conditions. These results suggest, that both compounds have no effect on the transport of both proteins, and thus on their steady-state localization.</p>It has not been observed a distinct inhibition of the transport of C1-M6PR and TGN46 induced by either compounds 161 or 193, further substantiating the specificity of both compounds towards exogenous toxins. This finding is highly surprising as to date all trafficking factors that have been found to be required for Shiga toxin transport have also been shown to be required for mannose 6-phosphate transport, when this was directly tested (Amessou et al., 2007). The finding that compounds 161 and 193 inhibit Shiga toxin trafficking without affecting mannose 6-phosphate transport is therefore highly unexpected.</p>11. Compounds 161 and 193 Effects are Robust and Observed on Others Human Cell Lines</p>Besides HeLa-cells, human monocytic, Gb3-expressing THP1-cells were used to characterize the inhibitory effect of the compounds. Concentrations of up to 100 \u03bcM of compounds did not cause any reduction in the overall protein biosynthesis. By using immunofluorescence, THP1-cells were incubated with 100 \u03bcM of compound for 30 min at 37\u00b0 C., before binding of StxB on ice for 30 min and internalization for 45 nm at 37\u00b0 C. Fixed cells were stained for the Golgi-marker giantin.</p>In line with the effect observed on HeLa-cells, a stark reduction of retrograde transport of StxB to the TGN was observed on THP1-cells treated with compounds 161 or 193. This suggests that the effect of these compounds is not restricted to a single cell-line, but can be observed on cells as diverse as epithelial HeLa-cells and monocytic THP1-cells.</p>CONCLUSIONIn the case of Stxs, after treatment with compounds 161 or 193 of toxin-sensitive HeLa-cells, a 50-100\u00d7 higher dose of toxin is necessary to cause a similar inhibitory effect on protein-biosynthesis as on control cells. This effect is attributed to an inhibition in the retrograde transport of the toxin at the interface between early endosomes and Golgi apparatus, and it is not due to a reduction in toxin binding or internalization, or an unspecific effect on cellular morphology or functional alteration of cellular compartments. The transport of StxB to the trans-Golgi network was reduced by 60-90%, as verified by sulfation assay. Compound-treatment of cells leads to an accumulation of StxB and CtxB in early endosomes. The effect of these compounds is confined to retrograde transport and does not affect other transport pathways, e.g. anterograde (secretory) or late endosomal (degradative) pathway. Even though these compounds impair the transport of exogenous toxins, Inventors unexpectedly did not observe a pronounced effect on endogenous cargos, such as C1-M6PR (cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor) or TGN46. Long-term treatment up to 3 days does not reduce cellular growth. On THP-1-cells, compounds 161 and 193 concentrations as high as 100 \u03bcM did not cause any apparent side effects.</p>In contrast to others small molecules, compounds 161 and 193 are specific to exogenous toxins (Shiga and cholera toxins) and they unexpectedly do not impact distinctly the transport of endogenous cargo (C1-M6PR, TGN46). Additionally, these compounds do no have any effect on the morphology of cellular compartments and do not influence cellular growth even after longer treatments (several days). Also, their effect is restricted to t"
