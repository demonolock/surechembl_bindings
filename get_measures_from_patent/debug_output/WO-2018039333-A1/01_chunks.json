    "one that is not significantly different or measurable different from the reference response. </p> The terms \"specific binding affinity\" or \"specifically binds\" or \"specifically bound\" or \"specific binding\" or \"specifically targets\" as used herein, describe binding of one molecule to another, e.g., DNA binding domain of a polypeptide binding to DNA, at greater binding affinity than background binding. A binding domain \"specifically binds\" to a target site if it binds to or associates with a target site with an affinity or Ka (i.e., an equilibrium association constant of a particular binding interaction with units of 1/M) of, for example, greater than or equal to about 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>\"1</sup>. In certain embodiments, a binding domain binds to a target site with a Ka greater than or equal to about 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>\"1</sup>, 10<sup>7</sup> M<sup>\"1</sup>, 10<sup>8</sup> M<sup>\"1</sup>, 10<sup>9</sup> M<sup>\"1</sup>, 10<sup>10</sup> M<sup>\"1</sup>, 10<sup>11</sup> M<sup>\"1</sup>, 10<sup>12</sup> M<sup>\"1</sup>, or 10<sup>13</sup> M<sup>\"1</sup>. \"High affinity\" binding domains refers to those binding domains with a Ka of at least 10<sup>7</sup> M<sup>\"1</sup>, at least 10<sup>8</sup> M<sup>\"1</sup>, at least 10<sup>9</sup> M<sup>\"</sup> at least 10<sup>10</sup> M<sup>\"1</sup>, at least 10<sup>11</sup> M<sup>\"1</sup>, at least 10<sup>12</sup> M<sup>\"1</sup>, at least 10<sup>13</sup> M<sup>\"1</sup>, or greater. </p> Alternatively, affinity may be defined as an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of a particular binding interaction with units of M (e.g., 10<sup>\"5</sup> M to 10<sup>\"13</sup> M, or less). </p> Affinities of nuclease variants comprising one or more DNA binding domains for DNA target sites contemplated in particular embodiments can be readily determined using conventional techniques, e.g., yeast cell surface display, or by binding association, or displacement assays using labeled ligands. </p> In one embodiment, the affinity of specific binding is about 2 times greater than background binding, about 5 times greater than background binding, about 10 times greater than background binding, about 20 times greater than background binding, about 50 times greater than background binding, about 100 times greater than background binding, or about 1000 times greater than background binding or more. </p> The terms \"selectively binds\" or \"selectively bound\" or \"selectively binding\" or</p>\"selectively targets\" and describe preferential binding of one molecule to a target molecule (on-target binding) in the presence of a plurality of off-target molecules. In particular embodiments, an HE or megaTAL selectively binds an on-target DNA binding site about 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 100, or 1000 times more frequently than the HE or megaTAL binds an off-target DNA target binding site. </p> \"On-target\" refers to a target site sequence. </p> \"Off-target\" refers to a sequence similar to but not identical to a target site sequence. \n\n A \"target site\" or \"target sequence\" is a c",

Illustrative examples of TALE proteins for deriving and designing DNA binding domains are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 9,017,967, and references cited therein, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. </p> In particular embodiments, a megaTAL comprises a TALE DNA binding domain comprising one or more repeat units that are involved in binding of the TALE DNA binding domain to its corresponding target DNA sequence. A single \"repeat unit\" (also referred to as a \"repeat\") is typically 33-35 amino acids in length. Each TALE DNA binding domain repeat unit includes 1 or 2 DNA-binding residues making up the Repeat Variable Di-Residue (RVD), typically at positions 12 and/or 13 of the repeat. The natural (canonical) code for DNA recognition of these TALE DNA binding domains has been determined such that an HD sequence at positions 12 and 13 leads to a binding to cytosine (C), NG binds to T, NI to A, NN binds to G or A, and NG binds to T. In certain embodiments, non-canonical (atypical) RVDs are contemplated. </p> Illustrative examples of non-canonical RVDs suitable for use in particular megaTALs contemplated in particular embodiments include, but are not limited to HH, KH, NH, NK, NQ, RH, RN, SS, NN, SN, KN for recognition of guanine (G); NI, KI, RI, HI, SI for recognition of adenine (A); NG, HG, KG, RG for recognition of thymine (T); RD, SD, HD, ND, KD, YG for recognition of cytosine (C); NV, HN for recognition of A or G; and H*, HA, KA, N* NA, NC, NS, RA, S*for recognition of A or T or G or C, wherein (*) means that the amino acid at position 13 is absent. Additional illustrative examples of RVDs suitable for use in particular megaTALs contemplated in particular embodiments \n\n further include those disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 8,614,092, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. </p> In particular embodiments, a megaTAL contemplated herein comprises a TALE DNA binding domain comprising 3 to 30 repeat units. In certain embodiments, a megaTAL comprises 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, or 30 TALE DNA binding domain repeat units. In a preferred embodiment, a megaTAL contemplated herein comprises a TALE DNA binding domain comprising 5-15 repeat units, more preferably 7-15 repeat units, more preferably 9-15 repeat units, and more preferably 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15 repeat units. </p> In particular embodiments, a megaTAL contemplated herein comprises a TALE</p>DNA binding domain comprising 3 to 30 repeat units and an additional single truncated TALE repeat unit comprising 20 amino acids located at the C-terminus of a set of TALE repeat units, i.e., an additional C-terminal half-TALE DNA binding domain repeat unit (amino acids -20 to -1 of the C-cap disclosed elsewhere herein, infra). Thus, in particular embodiments, a megaTAL contemplated ",
    "of a Daric receptor complex on the cell surface with the bridging factor associated with and disposed between the multimerization domains of the signaling polypeptide and the binding polypeptide. </p> In particular embodiments, the first and second multimerization domains associate with a bridging factor selected from the group consisting of: rapamycin or a rapalog thereof, coumermycin or a derivative thereof, gibberellin or a derivative thereof, abscisic acid (ABA) or a derivative thereof, methotrexate or a derivative thereof, cyclosporin A or a derivative thereof, FKCsA or a derivative thereof, trimethoprim (Tmp)-synthetic ligand for FKBP (SLF) or a derivative thereof, and any combination thereof. </p> Illustrative examples of rapamycin analogs (rapalogs) include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,649,595, which rapalog structures are incorporated herein by reference in \n\n their entirety. In certain embodiments, a bridging factor is a rapalog with substantially reduced immunosuppressive effect as compared to rapamycin. A \"substantially reduced immunosuppressive effect\" refers to a rapalog having at least less than 0.1 to 0.005 times the immunosuppressive effect observed or expected for an equimolar amount of rapamycin, as measured either clinically or in an appropriate in vitro (e.g., inhibition of T cell proliferation) or in vivo surrogate of human immunosuppressive activity. In one embodiment, \"substantially reduced immunosuppressive effect\" refers to a rapalog having an EC50 value in such an in vitro assay that is at least 10 to 250 times larger than the EC50 value observed for rapamycin in the same assay. </p> Other illustrative examples of rapalogs include, but are not limited to everolimus, novolimus, pimecrolimus, ridaforolimus, tacrolimus, temsirolimus, umirolimus, and zotarolimus. </p> In certain embodiments, multimerization domains will associate with a bridging factor being a rapamycin or rapalog thereof. For example, the first and second </p>multimerization domains are a pair selected from FKBP and FRB. FRB domains are polypeptide regions (protein \"domains\") that are capable of forming a tripartite complex with an FKBP protein and rapamycin or rapalog thereof. FRB domains are present in a number of naturally occurring proteins, including mTOR proteins (also referred to in the literature as FRAP, RAPTl, or RAFT) from human and other species; yeast proteins including Tori and Tor2; and a Candida FRAP homolog. Information concerning the nucleotide sequences, cloning, and other aspects of these proteins is already known in the art. For example, a protein sequence accession number for a human mTOR is GenBank Accession No. L34075.1 (Brown et al., Nature 369:756, 1994). </p> FRB domains suitable for use in particular embodiments contemplated herein generally contain at least about 85 to about 100 amino acid residues. In certain </p>embodiments, an FRB amino acid sequence for use in fusion proteins of this disclosure will comprise a 93 amino acid sequence Ile-2021 through Lys-2113 and a mutation of T2098L, based the amino ac"
