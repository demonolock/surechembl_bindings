In some embodiments the present antibodies may bind with greater affinity to CD122 and/or \u03b3c than to one or more members of the type I cytokine receptor family. In some embodiments, the extent of binding of an antibody to an unrelated target is less than about 10% of the binding of the antibody to the target as measured, e.g., by ELISA, SPR, Bio-Layer Interferometry or by a radioimmunoassay (RIA). Alternatively, the binding specificity may be reflected in terms of binding affinity where the anti-CD122 and/or \u03b3c antibody of the present invention binds to CD122 and/or \u03b3c with a K<sub>D </sub>that is at least 0.1 order of magnitude (i.e. 0.1\u00d710<sup>n</sup>, where n is an integer representing the order of magnitude) greater than the K<sub>D </sub>of the antibody towards another target molecule. This may optionally be one of at least 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0.</p>Binding affinity of an antibody for its target is often described in terms of its dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>). Binding affinity can be measured by methods known in the art, such as by ELISA, Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR; see e.g. Hearty et al., Methods Mol Biol (2012) 907:411-442), Bio-Layer Interferometry (see e.g. Lad et al., (2015) J Biomol Screen 20(4): 498-507), or by a radiolabeled antigen binding assay (RIA) performed with the Fab version of the antibody and antigen molecule.</p>In some embodiments, the antibody according to the present invention has a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) for CD122 of one of \u22641\u00d710<sup>\u22126 </sup>M, \u22647.5\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, \u22645\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, \u22644.5\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, \u22644\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, \u22645\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, \u22644.5\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, \u22643\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, \u22643.5\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, \u22643\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, \u22642.5\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, \u22642\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, \u22641.9\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, \u22641.8\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, \u22641.7\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, \u22641.6\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, \u22641.5\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, \u22641.4\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, \u22641.3\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, \u22641.2\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, \u22641.1\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, \u22641\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, \u22648\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, \u22646\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, \u22644\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, or \u22642\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M.</p>In some embodiments, the antibody according to the present invention has a K<sub>D </sub>for \u03b3c of one of \u226410\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, \u22647.5\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, \u22645\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, \u22642.5\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, \u22641\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, \u22649.5\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, \u22649\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, \u22648.5\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, \u22648\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, \u22647.5\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, \u22647\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, \u22646.5\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, \u22646\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, \u22645.5\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, \u22645\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, \u22644.5\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, \u22644\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, \u22643.5\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, \u22643\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, \u22642.5\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, \u22642\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, \u22641.5\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, \u22641\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, \u22648\u00d710<sup>\u22129 </sup>M, \u22646\u00d710<sup>\u22129 </sup>M, \u22644\u00d710<sup>\u22129</sup>M or \u22642\u00d710<sup>\u22129 </sup>M.</p>In some embodiments, the antibody according to the present invention has a K<sub>D </sub>for CD122 of one of ",

Specific Fab antibodies were originally identified by ELISA using recombinant IL-2R\u03b2 and \u03b3c proteins as antigens.</p>Example 2: Construction of a Bispecific Antibody Targeting the Medium Affinity IL-2R\u03b2-\u03b3cClones showing a strong binding in ELISA (Example 1) were selected and used to construct a \u201cknob-in-hole\u201d monovalent, bispecific human antibody based on a single chain variable fragment (scFv) linked to a IgG1 backbone Fc region as schematised in FIG. 19.</p>The \u201cknob-in-hole\u201d format prevents homodimerisation and formation of bivalent, monospecific antibodies.</p>A LALA mutation (substitution of leucine residues 234 and 235 in wild type heavy chain constant domain 2 by alanine) was introduced in the Fc portion of the antibody to abrogate binding to Fc receptor.</p>The size of the linker between the scFv domain and the Fc domain has no effect on the function of the construct (see Example 6.2 and FIG. 25).</p>Bispecific scFv (Bis-scFv) Format:</p>P1A3 and P2C4 scFv were tied with a linker",
    "es showed improved CD8:CD4 ratios following antibody stimulation (FIG. 38B).</p>The impact of the bispecific antibody on the expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs) was then measured and compared to expansion of Tregs in response to stimulation with IL-2, in the antigen specific (autologous LCL co-culture) and non-specific (anti-CD3/CD28 microbead) settings. Addition of the bispecific antibody results in significantly reduced expansion of Tregs as compared to Treg expansion in response to IL-2, in both the non-specific (FIG. 39A) and antigen-specific stimulation settings (FIG. 39B).</p>Example 12: In Vivo Data in Non-Human PrimatesA dose escalating experiment was established in Cynomolgus macaques in order to measure the effects of intravenous (iv) injection of the anti-IL-2R\u03b2/\u03b3c bispecific antibody, its ability to drive proliferation of T cells and NK cells, and its potential toxicity through \u201ccytokine storm\u201d.</p>Three macaques were administered a single dose of the anti-IL-2R\u03b2/\u03b3c antibody, intravenously through the femoral artery; macaque A received 1 mg/kg, macaque B received 5 mg/kg, and macaque C received 10 mg/kg. Blood was collected before antibody injection and at 1 h, 24 h, 72 h and 120 h post-injection.</p>Vital signs and physical examinations were performed throughout the study and then for a further 3 weeks. PBMCs were isolated at all time points, leukocyte subsets were analysed by immune-staining and flow cytometry, and cell expansion was assessed by analysis of Ki-67 expression. Plasma cytokine levels were measured by Luminex\u00ae at all time points.</p>Veterinary physical examination indicated no abnormalities in general appearance, mucosal membranes, cardiovascular, respiratory, integumentary, alimentary, musculoskeletal, nervous, urogenital, auditory, or ocular systems. Animals displayed no clinical findings of febrile illness or depression. One animal (macaque B) showed mild weight loss from which he recovered during the course of the study. Animals showed no overt signs of toxicity commonly associated with IL-2 administration (PMID: 1418698 and 8454416).</p>Consistent with these observations, cytokine analysis demonstrated only mild increases in inflammatory mediators post injection (FIGS. 40A to 40E). Flow cytometric analysis indicated a marked proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations (FIGS. 41A to 41C).</p>NK cell proliferation was also observed in response to the antibody treatment (FIGS. 42A and 42B). It should be noted that this expansion was observed after a single dose of antibody, compared to continuous infusion or repeated doses required for IL-2, suggesting that anti-IL-2R\u03b2/\u03b3c bispecific antibody has a longer half-life than IL-2.</p>"
