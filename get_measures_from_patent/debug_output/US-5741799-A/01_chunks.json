The reaction solution was stirred at room temperature for 10 min and quenched by the addition of 10% sodium bisulfite solution until the KI-starch paper test was negative. The mixture was diluted with 300 mL of EtOAc and washed with saturated NaHCO<sub>3</sub> solution (2\u00d7150 mL) and brine (1\u00d7150 mL).
