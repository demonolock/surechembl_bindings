    "the mRNA of PASK or the genomic DNA of PASK or they can interact with the polypeptide PASK. Often functional nucleic acids are designed to interact with other nucleic acids based on sequence homology between the target molecule and the functional nucleic acid molecule, hi other situations, the specific recognition between the functional nucleic acid molecule and the target molecule is not based on sequence homology between the functional nucleic acid molecule and the target molecule, but rather is based on the formation of tertiary structure that allows specific recognition to take place. \n\n 73. Antisense molecules are designed to interact with a target nucleic acid molecule through either canonical or non-canonical base pairing. The interaction of the antisense molecule and the target molecule is designed to promote the destruction of the target molecule through, for example, RNAseH mediated RNA-DNA hybrid degradation. Alternatively the antisense molecule is designed to interrupt a processing function that normally would take place on the target molecule, such as transcription or replication. Antisense molecules can be designed based on the sequence of the target molecule. Numerous methods for optimization of antisense efficiency by finding the most accessible regions of the target molecule exist. Exemplary methods would be in vitro selection experiments and DNA modification studies using DMS and DEPC. It is preferred that antisense molecules bind the target molecule with a dissociation constant (k<sub>d</sub>)less than or equal to 10<sup>~6</sup>, 10<sup>\"8</sup>, 10<sup>~10</sup>, or 10<sup>\"12</sup>. A representative sample of methods and techniques which aid in the design and use of antisense molecules can be found in the following non- limiting list of United States patents: 5,135,917, 5,294,533, 5,627,158, 5,641,754, 5,691,317, 5,780,607, 5,786,138, 5,849,903, 5,856,103, 5,919,772, 5,955,590, 5,990,088, 5,994,320, 5,998,602, 6,005,095, 6,007,995, 6,013,522, 6,017,898, 6,018,042, 6,025,198, 6,033,910, 6,040,296, 6,046,004, 6,046,319, and 6,057,437.</p>74. Aptamers are molecules that interact with a target molecule, preferably in a specific way. Typically aptamers are small nucleic acids ranging from 15-50 bases in length that fold into defined secondary and tertiary structures, such as stem-loops or G- quartets. Aptamers can bind small molecules, such as ATP (United States patent 5,631,146) and theophiline (United States patent 5,580,737), as well as large molecules, such as reverse transcriptase (United States patent 5,786,462) and thrombin (United States patent 5,543,293). Aptamers can bind very tightly with kas from the target molecule of less than 10<sup>\"12</sup> M. It is preferred that the aptamers bind the target molecule with a kd less than 10<sup>\"6</sup>, 10<sup>\"8</sup>, 10<sup>\"10</sup>, or 10<sup>\"12</sup>. Aptamers can bind the target molecule with a very high degree of specificity. For example, aptamers have been isolated that have greater than a 10000 fold difference in binding affinities between the target molecule and another molecule that differ at only a single position on the molecule (United States patent 5,543,293). It is preferred that the aptamer have a k<sub>d</sub> with the target molecule at least 10, 100, 1000, 10,000, or 100,000 fold lower than the k<sub>d</sub> with a background binding molecule. \n\n It is preferred when doing the comparison for a polypeptide for example, that the background molecule be a different polypeptide.</p>75. Representative examples of how to make and use aptamers to bind a variety of different target molecules can be found in the following non-limiting list of United States patents: 5,476,766, 5,503,978, 5,631,146, 5,731,424 , 5,780,228, 5,792,613, 5,795,721, 5,846,713, 5,858,660 , 5,861,254, 5,864,026, 5,869,641, 5,958,691, 6,001,988, 6,011,020, 6,013,443, 6,020,130, 6,028,186, 6,030,776, and 6,051,698.</p>76. Ribozymes are nucleic acid molecules that are capable of catalyzing a chemical reaction, either intramolecularly or intermolecularly. Ribozymes are thus catalytic nucleic acid. It is preferred that the ribozymes catalyze intermolecular reactions. There are a number of different types of ribozymes that catalyze nuclease or nucleic acid polymeras"
