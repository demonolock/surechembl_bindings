    "ffinity for the binding of 1,4- and 1,5-benzodiazepines (Squires, RF and Braestrup, C., Nature (London) 266 (1977), 734). These sites are called benzodiazepine receptors.</p>The receptor affinity which is important for the pharmacological properties of the compounds according to the invention was determined by examining the displacement capacity of radioactive-labeled flunitrazepam from benzodiazepine receptors.</p>The displacement activity of the compounds according to the invention is given as the ICund and ED\u2075\u2070 value. The IC\u2075\u2079 value indicates the concentration which a 50% displacement of the specific binding of H\u00b3-flunitrazepam (1.0 nM, 0 \u00b0 C) in samples with a total volume of 0.55 ml of a suspension of brain membranes, e.g. caused by rats.</p>The displacement test is carried out as follows: </p>0.5 ml of a suspension of untreated rat forebrain in 25 mM KH\u2082PO\u2084, pH = 7.1 (5-10 mg tissue / sample) is for 40 to 60 minutes at 0 \u00b0 C together with \u00b3H-diazepam (specific activity 14.4 Ci / mmol, 1.9 nM) or 3 H-flunitrazepam (specific activity 87 Ci / mmol, 1.0 nM). After incubation, the suspension is filtered through a glass frit, the residue is washed twice with cold buffer solution and the radioactivity is measured in the scintillation counter.</p>The experiment is then repeated, but in such a way that a certain amount or an excess amount of the compound whose displacement activity is to be determined is added before the addition of the radioactively labeled benzodiazepine. The IC\u2085\u2080 value can then be calculated on the basis of the values obtained.</p>The ED\u2085\u2080 value represents the dose of a test substance which brings about a reduction in the specific binding of the flunitrazepam to the benzodiazepine receptor in a living brain to 50% of the control value.</p>The in vivo test is carried out as follows:</p>Groups of mice are injected with the test substance at different doses and usually intraperitoneally. After 15 minutes, the 3 H-flunitrazepam is administered intravenously to the mice. After a further 20 minutes, the mice are sacrificed, their forebrain removed and the radioactivity specifically bound to the brain membranes measured by scintillation counting. The ED\u2085\u2080 value is determined from the dose / effect curves. </p>The compounds according to the invention show, in particular, anxiolytic and anticonvulsant activity in the pharmacological test. To investigate the anticonvulsant effect, the elimination of the cramps induced with pentylenetetrazole (pentazole) is investigated. Pentazol is given in an amount of 150 mg / kg as a hydrochloric acid solution (pH 2-3) subcutaneously 15-30 minutes after the intraperitoneal application of the test substance. This amount induces clonic and tonic spasms that lead to death in untreated animals. The number of mice showing convulsions and the number of those who died 30 minutes after pentazole are recorded.</p>According to the method of Litchfield and Wilcoxon (J.Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 96 (1949) 99-103) the ED"
