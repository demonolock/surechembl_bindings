    " * 2 minutes (Vibracell ultrasonic apparatus) on ice.In 4 \u2103 with 500g with centrifugal 20 minutes of prepared product, discard throw out, in 4 \u2103 with 43 ' 000g (19 ' 000rpm) with centrifugal 1 hour of supernatant liquor.Throw out is resuspended in 12.5ml lysis buffer+12.5ml 20% sucrose, uses Polytron homogenate 1-2 minute.Measure protein concn by the Bradford method, sample be divided into aliquot, in-80 \u2103 of preservations until use.For in conjunction with research, with the aliquot sample of 60mg yttrium silicate SPA pearl (peace agate West Asia (Amersham) company) and film at binding buffer liquid (50mM Tris, 120mM NaCl, 5mM KCl, 2mM CaCl\n        <sub>2</sub>, 10mM MgCl\n        <sub>2</sub>) the middle mixing 15 minutes.Then 50ul pearl/film mixture is joined in each hole of 96 orifice plates, add the 4nM 3H-vasopressin (U.S.'s radio-labeled chemical company (American Radiolabeled Chemicals)) of 50ul then.For the mensuration of total binding, 100ul binding buffer liquid is joined in each hole; For non-specific binding, add the cold vasopressin of 100ul 8.4mM; For compound determination, add the serial dilution thing of each compound of 100ul in 2%DMSO.Plank incubated at room 1 hour, with 1000g centrifugal 1 minute, is counted on Packard Top-Count.From each hole, deduct the counting of non-specific binding, data are incorporated into column criterionization by the maximum specificity that is set at 100%.Use nonlinear regression model (NLRM) (XLfit) matched curve to calculate IC50, and use Cheng-Prussoff Equation for Calculating Ki.\n      </p>EmbodimentKi (nM) [people V1a]EmbodimentKi (nM) [people V1a] 1 32 16 20 2 2053 17 5.7 3 402 18 6 4 310 19 46 5 130 20 10 6 118 21 88 7 117 22 200 8 136 23 2 10 3 24 10 11 5 25 28 12 7 26 8 13 8 27 29 15 7 28 166</p>Formula (I) compound and pharmaceutically useful acid salt thereof can for example be used as medicine with pharmaceutical dosage forms.Described pharmaceutical preparation can be for example with the form dosage forms for oral administration of tablet, coated tablet, dragee, hard and Gelseal, solution, emulsion or suspensoid.But, can also for example use with the form per rectum of suppository, perhaps for example carry out parenteral and use with the form of injection solution.</p>Formula (I) compound and pharmaceutically useful acid salt thereof can be with the pharmaceutically inert that is used to prepare tablet, coated tablet, dragee and hard-gelatin capsules inorganic or organic excipients process.Lactose, W-Gum or derivatives thereof, talcum powder, stearic acid or its salt etc. can be as this class vehicle that for example is used for tablet, dragee and hard-gelatin capsules.</p>The vehicle that is applicable to Gelseal is vegetables oil, wax class, fat, semisolid and liquid polyol etc. for example.</p>The vehicle that is applicable to preparation solution and syrup is water, polyvalent alcohol, sucrose, Nulomoline, glucose etc. for example.</p>The vehicle that is applicable to injection solution is water, alcohol, polyvalent alcohol, glyceri"
