    "ells express genes that are not found within the native (non-recombinant) form of the cell or express native genes that are otherwise abnormally expressed, under expressed or not expressed at all.</p>The term \u201cheterologous\u201d when used with reference to portions of a nucleic acid indicates that the nucleic acid comprises two or more subsequences that are not found in the same relationship to each other in nature. For instance, the nucleic acid is typically recombinantly produced, having two or more sequences from unrelated genes arranged to make a new functional nucleic acid, e.g., a promoter from one source and a coding region from another source. Similarly, a heterologous protein indicates that the protein comprises two or more subsequences that are not found in the same relationship to each other in nature (e.g., a fusion protein).</p>The term \u201cantibody\u201d refers to a polypeptide comprising a framework region from an immunoglobulin gene, or fragments thereof, that specifically bind and recognize an antigen, e.g., TIM3, a particular cell surface marker, or any desired target. Typically, the \u201cvariable region\u201d contains the antigen-binding region of the antibody (or its functional equivalent) and is most critical in specificity and affinity of binding. See Paul, Fundamental Immunology (2003).</p>An exemplary immunoglobulin (antibody) structural unit comprises a tetramer. Each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one \u201clight\u201d (about 25 kD) and one \u201cheavy\u201d chain (about 50-70 kD). The N-terminus of each chain defines a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The terms variable light chain (V<sub>L</sub>) and variable heavy chain (V<sub>H</sub>) refer to these light and heavy chains respectively.</p>An \u201cisotype\u201d is a class of antibodies defined by the heavy chain constant region. Immunoglobulin genes include the kappa, lambda, alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon, and mu constant region genes. Light chains are classified as either kappa or lambda. Heavy chains are classified as gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon, which in turn define the isotype classes, IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE, respectively.</p>Antibodies can exist as intact immunoglobulins or as any of a number of well-characterized fragments that include specific antigen-binding activity. Such fragments can be produced by digestion with various peptidases. Pepsin digests an antibody below the disulfide linkages in the hinge region to produce F(ab)\u2032<sub>2</sub>, a dimer of Fab which itself is a light chain joined to V<sub>H</sub>\u2014C<sub>H</sub>1 by a disulfide bond. The F(ab)\u2032<sub>2 </sub>may be reduced under mild conditions to break the disulfide linkage in the hinge region, thereby converting the F(ab)\u2032<sub>2 </sub>dimer into an Fab\u2032 monomer. The Fab\u2032 monomer is essentially Fab with part of the hinge region (see Fundamental Immunology (Paul ed., 3d ed. 1993). While various antibody fragments are defined in terms of the digestion of an in",
    " can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers (see, e.g., Jones et al., Nature 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323-327 (1988); Verhoeyen et al., Science 239:1534-1536 (1988) and Presta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2:593-596 (1992)), by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Such humanized antibodies are chimeric antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567), wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.</p>In some cases, the antibody or antibody fragment can be conjugated to another molecule, e.g., polyethylene glycol (PEGylation) or serum albumin, to provide an extended half-life in vivo. Examples of PEGylation of antibody fragments are provided in Knight et al. Platelets 15:409, 2004 (for abciximab); Pedley et al., Br. J. Cancer 70:1126, 1994 (for an anti-CEA antibody); Chapman et al., Nature Biotech. 17:780, 1999; and Humphreys, et al., Protein Eng. Des. 20: 227, 2007). The antibody or antibody fragment can also be labeled, or conjugated to a therapeutic agent as described below.</p>B. Binding Affinity</p>The specificity of the binding can be defined in terms of the comparative dissociation constants (Kd) of the antibody (or other targeting moiety) for target, as compared to the dissociation constant with respect to the antibody and other materials in the environment or unrelated molecules in general. Typically, the Kd for the antibody with respect to the unrelated material will be at least 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold, 20-fold, 50-fold, 100-fold, 200-fold or higher than Kd with respect to the target.</p>The desired affinity for an antibody, e.g., high (pM to low nM), medium (low nM to 100 nM), or low (about 100 nM or higher), may differ depending upon whether it is being used as a diagnostic or therapeutic. Without being limited to theory, in one example, an antibody with medium affinity may be more successful in localizing to a tumor as compared to one with a high affinity. Thus, antibodies having different affinities can be used for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.</p>A targeting moiety will typically bind with a Kd of less than about 1000 nM, e.g., less than 250, 100, 50, 20 or lower nM. In some embodiments, the Kd of the affinity agent is less than 15, 10, 5, or 1 nM. In some embodiments, the Kd is 1-100 nM, 0.1-50 nM, 0.1-10 nM, or 1-20 nM. The value of the dissociation constant (Kd) can be determined by well-known methods, and can be computed even for complex mixtures by methods as disclosed, e.g., in Caceci et al., Byte (1984) 9:340-362.</p>Affinity of an antibody, or any targeting agent, for a target can be determined according to methods known in the art, e.g., as reviewed in Ernst et al. Determination of Equilibrium Dissociation Constants, Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies (Wiley &amp; Sons ed. 2009).</p>Quantitative ELISA, and similar array-based affinity methods can be used. ELISA (Enzyme linked immunosorbent signaling assay) is an antibody-based method. In some cases, an antibody specific for target of interest is affixed to a substrate, and contacted with a sample suspected of containing the target. The surface is then washed to remove unbound substances. Target binding can be detected in a variety of ways, e.g., using a second step with a labeled antibody, direct labeling of the target, or labeling of the primary antibody with a label that is detectable upon antigen binding. In some cases, the antigen is affixed to the substrate (e.g., using a substrate with high affinity for proteins, or a Strepavidin-biotin interaction) and detected using a labeled antibody (or other targeting moiety). Several permutations of the original ELISA methods have been developed and are known in the art (see Lequin (2005) Clin. Chem. 51:2415-18 for a review).</p>The Kd, Kon, and Koff can also be determined using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), e.g., as measured by using a Biacore T100 system. SPR techniques are reviewed, e.g., in Hahnfeld et al. Determination of Kinetic Data Using SPR Biosensors, Molecular Diagnosis of Infectious Diseases (2004). In a typical SPR experiment, one interactant (target or targeting agent) is immobilized on an SPR-active, gold-coated glass slide in a flow cell, and a sample containing the other interactant is introduced to flow across the surface. When light of a given frequency is shined on the surface, the changes to the optical reflectivity of the gold indicate binding, and the kinetics of binding.</p>Binding affinity can also be determined by anchoring a biotinylated interactant to a streptaviden (SA) sensor chip. The other interactant is then contacted with the chip and detected, e.g., as described in Abdessamad et al. (2002) Nuc. Acids Res. 30:e45.</p>C. Internalization</p>TIM3-specific antibodies described herein can be internalized into TIM3-expressing cells, including TIM3-expressing lymphoma and AML cells. For example, TIM3 specific antibodies are shown in the Examples (and FIGS. 3 and 4) to be internalized into B lymphoma cells. In some cases, the disclosed antibodies are internalized at a higher rate, or at a higher level, than the 2E2 anti-TIM3 antibody. As demonstrated herein, the TIM3-specific antibodies described herein provide an effective means for targeting TIM3-expressing cells, e.g., wit"
