    "nreacted iodine was separated from the protein by gel filtration on Excellulose GF-5 desalting column (Pierce). The specific activity of the radiolabeled naturally-occurring NRSF (<sup>125</sup>I-NRSF) was 3 \u00d7 106 cpm/ng. The radiolabeled NRSF (10 picomolar) was incubated for sixty minutes at 4\u00b0C with monolayers of MDA-MB-453 cells that were grown in a 24-well dish (Costar). This incubation was also performed in the presence of conditioned media from transfected COS-7 cells. Unbound <sup>125</sup>I-NRSF was removed by three washes with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and the cells were solubilized in 0.1 N NaOH solution containing 0.1% SDS. Radioactivity was </p>determined with a \u03b3-counter. </p> As depicted in Figure 10, conditioned medium containing recombinant NRSF expressed from the pJT- \n\n2/NRSF expression vector (Fig. 2) in COS-7 cells reduced the total <sup>125</sup>I-NRSF binding by approximately 50%. For a negative control, COS-7 conditioned medium from cells transfected with a pJT-2 expression vector containing a rat TGF\u03b1 cDNA (Blasband, A. et al., Mol . Cell Biol . 10 : 2111-2121, 1990) was employed. In contrast to the recombinant NRSF conditioned medium, the TGF\u03b1 </p>conditioned medium did not inhibit <sup>125</sup>I-NRSF binding. The partial inhibitory effect of the recombinant NRSF conditioned medium, as compared with the purified, natural, unlabeled NRSF (Peles, E. et al., Cell </p>55:205-216, 1992), may be attributed to its relatively low concentration in the binding assay. In addition, it could be due to high non-specific ligand binding. </p> To overcome this problem and also demonstrate direct interaction with neu receptor, a covalent </p>crosslinking assay was employed. This was performed by allowing MDA-MB-453 cells to bind <sup>125</sup>I-NRSF in the presence of transfected COS-7 cell conditioned media, as above. The chemical crosslinking reagent bis </p> (sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS<sup>3</sup>, Pierce) was added at 1 mM final concentration after one hour of binding at 4\u00b0C, followed by a brief wash with PBS. Following forty-five minutes of incubation at 22\u00b0C, the monolayers were incubated for ten minutes with quenching buffer (100 mM glycine in PBS, pH 7.4). The cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS, lysed in lysis buffer, and the neu protein was immunoprecipitated with </p>monoclonal antibody Ab-3 according to the protocol described in Peles, E. et al., EMBO J. 20:2077-2086 (1991). The extensively washed immunocomplexes were resolved by gel electrophoresis (6% acrylamide) and autoradiography. The results of this analysis (Fig. 11) indicated that the recombinant NRSF, unlike recombinant TGF\u03b1, was able to displace most of the receptor-bound \n\n<sup>125</sup>I-NRSF. This result confirmed that the clone 44 cDNA encodes a functional NRSF molecule. </p>EXAMPLE 6 </p> Northern Blot Analyses of NRSF Expression </p>To determine the size and tissue distribution of the NRSF mRNA, Northern blot hybridization </p>experiments"
