    "DNA capable of hybridization to a DNA of (a) under moderately stringent conditions and that encodes biologically active B7L-1; and, (c) DNA that is degenerate as a result of the genetic code to a DNA defined in (a), or (b) and that encodes biologically active B7L-1. B7L-1 proteins encoded by such DNA equivalent sequences are encompassed by the invention. </p> DNAs that are equivalents to the DNA sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:3, or SEQ ID NO:5 will hybridize under moderately and severely stringent conditions to DNA sequences that encode polypeptides comprising SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:4, SEQ ID NO:6 or fragments and variants of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, and 6. Examples of B7L-1 proteins encoded by such DNA, include, but are not limited to, B7L-1 fragments (soluble or membrane bound) and B7L-1 proteins comprising inactivated N-glycosylation site(s), inactivated KEX2 protease processing site(s), or conservative amino acid substitution(s), as described above. B7L-1 proteins encoded by DNA derived from other mammalian species, wherein the DNA will hybridize to the cDNA of SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:3, or SEQ ID NO:5 are also encompassed by the present invention. </p> Variants possessing the ability to bind B7L-1 counterstructures, or binding partners, e.g. LDCAM may be identified by any suitable assay. Biological activity of B7L-1 may be determined, for example, by competition for binding to the ligand binding domain of LDCAM (i.e. competitive binding assays). </p> One type of a competitive binding assay for a B7L-1 polypeptide uses a radiolabeled, soluble B7L-1 and intact cells expressing a B7L-1 counterstructure, or cells expressing LDCAM. Instead of intact cells, one could substitute soluble B7L-1 counterstructure Fc fusion proteins (such as a LDCAM/Fc fusion protein) bound to a solid phase through the interaction of a Protein A, Protein G or an antibody to the counterstructure or Fc portions of the molecule, with the Fc region of the fusion protein. Another type of competitive binding assay utilizes radiolabeled soluble B7L-1 binding proteins and intact cells expressing B7L-1. </p> Competitive binding assays can be performed following conventional methodology. For example, radiolabeled B7L-1 can be used to compete with a putative B7L-1 homologue to assay for binding activity against a surface-bound B7L-1 binding protein or a binding counterstructure, e.g. LDCAM. Qualitative results can be obtained by competitive autoradiographic plate binding assays, or Scatchard plots may be utilized to generate quantitative results. </p> Binding proteins for a B7L-1 counterstructure, such as B7L-1 itself and anti-B7L-1 ligand antibodies, can be bound to a solid phase such as a column chromatography matrix or a similar substrate suitable for identifying, separating or purifying cells that express the B7L-1 binding protein on their surface. Binding of a B7L-1 counterstructure binding protein to a solid phase contacting surface can be accomplished by using a number of different techniques. For example, a B7L-1/Fc fusion protein can be constructed and then attached to the solid phase through the interaction of Protein A or Protein G. Various other means for fixing proteins to a solid phase are well known in the art and are suitable arrogant for use in the present invention. For example, magnetic microspheres can be coated with B7L-1 and held in the incubation vessel through a magnetic field. Suspensions of cell mixtures containing a B7L-1 counterstructure-expressing "
