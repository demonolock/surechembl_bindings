    "y fitting kinetic sensorgrams to a monovalent binding model (1: 1 binding).</p>aPTT</p>Pooled human plasma (90 \u03bc L) (from three individual subjects) anticoagulated with 0.38% sodium citrate was mixed with 10 \u03bc L of antibody at different concentrations (0-75 or 100 \u03bc g/mL) or control (PBS) and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. Then 40. mu.L of the plasma/antibody mixture was incubated with 40. mu.L of aPTT reagent (Synthasil, #0020006800, Instrumentation Laboratory, Bedford, Mass.) at 37 \u2103 for 3 minutes. After incubation for 3 min, 40. mu.L CaCl was added<sub>2</sub>And the clotting time was determined on a KC4 analyzer (TCoag). Each sample was assayed in duplicate.</p>FXIIa inhibition</p>A solution of 20nM FXIIa (Enzyme Research Labs # HFXIIa3350) (HBS) + 0.1% BSA in HEPES buffered saline was prepared. Each humanized antibody was added to a 20nM solution of FXIIa, along with murine monoclonal AB053 and chimeric antibody, at a final antibody concentration of 10 nM. 90 \u03bc L of each antibody sample was plated in duplicate onto a 96-well plate and 10 \u03bc L of chromogenic substrate S-2302 was added to each well. Plates were read at 405nm for 15min at 37 \u2103.</p>Calculation of humanization score for humanized chain</p>The T20 scores for the parent and humanized antibodies are shown in table 4.</p>Table 4: humanity score of all humanized chains</p></p>Affinity measurements by ELISA</p>The results of the affinity measurements of the ELISA are shown in figure 11.

Based on the above data, humanized antibody PP13893(HC1+ LC1) was selected as a lead candidate for continued development as antibody AB 054. Comparison of AB054 with AB053 for aPTT in human and Baboon plasma</p>The effect of AB054 on aPTT elongation in human and baboon plasma was compared to that of the murine parent antibody AB053 (fig. 14A-14B).</p>Summary of the invention</p>The results described in this example indicate that AB053 was successfully humanized and PP13893 (hereinafter \"AB 054\") was selected for further study. Antibody AB054 had a KD of 0.3mM and was shown to prolong aPTT in human and baboon plasma, similar to murine monoclonal AB 053. In addition, AB054 inhibited human FXIIa, confirming that binding to FXII and inhibition of FXIIa activity was maintained after humanization.</p>Example 6: assessment of antithrombotic efficacy of AB054 in membrane lung oxygenator perfusion systems</p>This example describes a study to evaluate the antithrombotic effect of AB054 in a model of surface-induced thrombosis. Antibodies were tested in a surface-triggered thrombosis model in baboons. An infant membrane lung oxygenator for extracorporeal membrane lung oxygenation is inserted into an extension ring of baboon arteriovenous shunt. Clot formation and growth within the membrane lung oxygenator was measured after treatment with AB054, heparin, or a combination of both. The data disclosed herein show that AB054 alone or AB054 in combination with heparin reduces thrombosis within a membrane lung oxygenator device.</p>Introduction to</p>Blood-contacting medical devices, including catheters, stents, grafts, filters, and extracorporeal organ support systems, may fail due to thrombus accumulation in the system, and may also trigger thromboembolism associated with the device. To maintain patency, devices that are perfused for various lengths of time require prophylactic anticoagulation, which can increase the incidence and/or severity of bleeding. In vitro membrane pulmonary oxygenation (ECMO) has been increasingly used for s"
