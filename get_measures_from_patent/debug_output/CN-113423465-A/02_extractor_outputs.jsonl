{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n* Antibody AB054 had a KD of 0.3mM and was shown to prolong aPTT in human and baboon plasma, similar to murine monoclonal AB 053.\n* The calculated EC50 for each antibody is listed in table 5.\n* Affinity measurements for nine humanized antibodies as well as chimeric antibodies as measured by Octet are shown in table 6, but no specific values are provided in the text snippet.\n* A solution of 20nM FXIIa (Enzyme Research Labs # HFXIIa3350) was prepared, but no specific bioactivity metric value is provided in this sentence.\n* Each humanized antibody was added to a 20nM solution of FXIIa, along with murine monoclonal AB053 and chimeric antibody, at a final antibody concentration of 10 nM, but no specific bioactivity metric value is provided in this sentence.\n\nHowever, only the first sentence meets all the criteria, so the revised output is:\n\n* Antibody AB054 had a KD of 0.3mM and was shown to prolong aPTT in human and baboon plasma, similar to murine monoclonal AB 053."}
