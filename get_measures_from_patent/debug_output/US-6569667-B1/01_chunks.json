Other preferred proteins are DHY proteins having one or more of the following domains: a transmembrane domain, a serine/threonine dehydratase pyridoxal-phosphate attachment site, a serine/threonine dehydratase domain, and/or a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent lyase synthase domain and, preferably, a DHY activity.</p>Additional preferred proteins have one or more of the following domains: a transmembrane domain, a serine/threonine dehydratase pyridoxal-phosphate attachment site, a serine/threonine dehydratase domain, and/or a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent lyase synthase domain, and are, preferably, encoded by a nucleic acid molecule having a nucleotide sequence which hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to a nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 or 3.</p>The nucleotide sequence of the isolated human DHY cDNA and the predicted amino acid sequence of the human DHY polypeptide are shown in FIG. 1 and in SEQ ID NOs:1 and 2, respectively.</p>The human DHY gene, which is approximately 1327 nucleotides in length, encodes a protein having a molecular weight of approximately 36.2 kD and which is approximately 329 amino acid residues in length.</p>Various aspects of the invention are described in further detail in the following subsections:</p>I. Isolated Nucleic Acid MoleculesOne aspect of the invention pertains to isolated nucleic acid molecules that encode DHY proteins or biologically active portions thereof, as well as nucleic acid fragments sufficient for use as hybridization probes to identify DHY-encoding nucleic acid molecules (e.g., DHY mRNA) and fragments for use as PCR primers for the amplification or mutation of DHY nucleic acid molecules. As used herein, the term \u201cnucleic acid molecule\u201d is intended to include DNA molecules (e.g., cDNA or genomic DNA) and RNA molecules (e.g., mRNA) and analogs of the DNA or RNA generated using nucleotide analogs. The nucleic acid molecule can be single-stranded or double-stranded, but preferably is double-stranded DNA.</p>The term \u201cisolated nucleic acid molecule\u201d includes nucleic acid molecules which are separated from other nucleic acid molecules which are present in the natural source of the nucleic acid. For example, with regards to genomic DNA, the term \u201cisolated\u201d includes nucleic acid molecules which are separated from the chromosome with which the genomic DNA is naturally associated. Preferably, an \u201cisolated\u201d nucleic acid is free of sequences which naturally flank the nucleic acid (i.e., sequences located at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the nucleic acid) in the genomic DNA of the organism from which the nucl",
    "cation, and for screening cDNA libraries for gene products having a selected property. Such techniques are adaptable for rapid screening of the gene libraries generated by the combinatorial mutagenesis of DHY proteins. The most widely used techniques, which are amenable to high through-put analysis, for screening large gene libraries typically include cloning the gene library into replicable expression vectors, transforming appropriate cells with the resulting library of vectors, and expressing the combinatorial genes under conditions in which detection of a desired activity facilitates isolation of the vector encoding the gene whose product was detected. Recursive ensemble mutagenesis (REM), a technique which enhances the frequency of functional mutants in the libraries, can be used in combination with the screening assays to identify DHY variants (Arkin and Yourvan (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:7811-7815; Delgrave et al. (1993) Protein Engineering 6(3):327-331).</p>In one embodiment, cell based assays can be exploited to analyze a variegated DHY library. For example, a library of expression vectors can be transfected into a cell line, e.g., a neuronal cell line, which ordinarily responds to a DHY ligand in a particular DHY ligand-dependent manner. The transfected cells are then contacted with a DHY ligand and the effect of expression of the mutant on, e.g., membrane excitability of DHY can be detected. Plasmid DNA can then be recovered from the cells which score for inhibition, or alternatively, potentiation of signaling by the DHY ligand, and the individual clones further characterized.</p>An isolated DHY protein, or a portion or fragment thereof, can be used as an immunogen to generate antibodies that bind DHY using standard techniques for polyclonal and monoclonal antibody preparation. A full-length DHY protein can be used or, alternatively, the invention provides antigenic peptide fragments of DHY for use as immunogens. The antigenic peptide of DHY comprises at least 8 amino acid residues of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:2 and encompasses an epitope of DHY such that an antibody raised against the peptide forms a specific immune complex with the DHY protein. Preferably, the antigenic peptide comprises at least 10 amino acid residues, more preferably at least 15 amino acid residues, even more preferably at least 20 amino acid residues, and most preferably at least 30 amino acid residues.</p>Preferred epitopes encompassed by the antigenic peptide are regions of DHY that are located on the surface of the protein, e.g., hydrophilic regions, as well as regions with high antigenicity (see, for example, FIG. 2).</p>A DHY immunogen typically is used to prepare antibodies by immunizing a suitable subject, (e.g., rabbit, goat, mouse or other mammal) with the immunogen. An appropriate immunogenic preparation can contain, for example, recombinantly expressed DHY protein or a chemically synthesized DHY polypeptide. The preparation can",
    "ons inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of individuals.</p>Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compounds which exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. While compounds that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such compounds to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects.</p>The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.</p>As defined herein, a therapeutically effective amount of protein or polypeptide (i.e., an effective dosage) ranges from about 0.001 to 30 mg/kg body weight. preferably about 0.01 to 25 mg/kg body weight, more preferably about 0.1 to 20 mg/kg body weight, and even mole preferably about 1 to 10 mg/kg, 2 to 9 mg/kg, 3 to 8 mg/kg, 4 to 7 mg/kg, or 5 to 6 mg/kg body weight. The skilled artisan will appreciate that certain factors may influence the dosage required to effectively treat a subject, including but not limited to the severity of the disease or disorder, previous treatments, the general health and/or age of the subject, and other diseases present. Moreover, treatment of a subject with a therapeutically effective amount of a protein, polypeptide, or antibody can include a single treatment or, preferably, can include a series of treatments.</p>In a preferred example, a subject is treated with antibody, protein, or polypeptide in the range of between about 0.1 to 20 mg/kg body weight, one time per week for between about 1 to 10 weeks, preferably between 2 to 8 weeks, more preferably between about 3 to 7 weeks, and even more preferably for about 4, 5, or 6 weeks. It will also be appreciated that the effective dosage of antibody, protein, or polypepti",
    " a DHY agonist or antagonist, a peptidomimetic of a DHY agonist or antagonist, or other small molecule. In one embodiment, the agent stimulates one or more DHY activities. Examples of such stimulatory agents include active DHY protein and a nucleic acid molecule encoding DHY that has been introduced into the cell. In another embodiment, the agent inhibits one or more DHY activities. Examples of such inhibitory agents include antisense DHY nucleic acid molecules, anti-DHY antibodies, and DHY inhibitors. These modulatory methods can be performed in vitro (e.g., by culturing the cell with the agent) or, alternatively, in vivo (e.g., by administering the agent to a subject). As such, the present invention provides methods of treating an individual afflicted with a disease or disorder characterized by aberrant or unwanted expression or activity of a DHY protein or nucleic acid molecule. In one embodiment, the method involves administering an agent (e.g., an agent identified by a screening assay described herein), or combination of agents that modulates (e.g., upregulates or downregulates) DHY expression or activity. In another embodiment, the method involves administering a DHY protein or nucleic acid molecule as therapy to compensate for reduced, aberrant, or unwanted DHY expression or activity.</p>Stimulation of DHY activity is desirable in situations in which DHY is abnormally downregulated and/or in which increased DHY activity is likely to have a beneficial effect. Likewise, inhibition of DHY activity is desirable in situations in which DHY is abnormally upregulated and/or in which decreased DHY activity is likely to have a beneficial effect.</p>3. Pharmacogenomics</p>The DHY molecules of the present invention, as well as agents, or modulators which have a stimulatory or inhibitory effect on DHY activity (e.g., DHY gene expression) as identified by a screening assay described herein can be administered to individuals to treat (prophylactically or therapeutically) DHY-associated disorders (e.g., proliferative disorders, CNS disorders, cardiac disorders, metabolic disorders, or muscular disorders) associated with aberrant or unwanted DHY activity. In conjunction with such treatment, pharmacogenomics (i.e., the study of the relationship between an individual's genotype and that individual's response to a foreign compound or drug) may be considered. Differences in metabolism of therapeutics can lead to severe toxicity or therapeutic failure by altering the relation between dose and blood concentration of the pharmacologically active drug. Thus, a physician or clinician may consider applying knowledge obtained in relevant pharmacogenomics studies in determining whether to administer a DHY molecule or DHY modulator as well as tailoring the dosage and/or therapeutic regimen of treatment with a DHY molecule or DHY modulator.</p>Pharmacogenomics deals with clinically significant hereditary variations in the response to drugs due to altered drug dispositio"
