    "directed against mouse IgG coupled with alkaline phosphatase diluted to 1/5000 (ref 115-055-003, Jackson Immunoresearch) in the presence of DNPP; or</p>with a goat polyclonal antibody directed against the light human kappa chain coupled with alkaline phosphatase diluted to 1/500 (ref 2060-04, SouthernBiotech) in the presence of DNPP.</p>Demonstration of the accessibility of VHH CEA 17 when the VHH CD16 c21 is bound to rhCD16 adsorbed in the microwells with biotinylated rhCEA and streptavidin coupled with alkaline phosphatase diluted to 1/500 (DAKO, cat D0396).</p>Affinity Constants for the Anti-CEA and Anti-CD16 Antibodies by Biacore:</p>BIACORE uses the principle of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to monitor, in real time, the interactions between molecules without their labelling. One of the partners in the interaction is covalently immobilised on a biosensor while the other is injected in a continuous flow. The principle of detection by SPR allows the changes in the mass to be monitored at the surface of the biosensor due to the formation and then the dissociation of the molecular complexes. The response, quantified in resonance units (RU) is a direct indication of the rate of binding of the analyte by the measurement of the variation of the refraction index. The recorded signal (a sensorgram) is processed mathematically to obtain the association speed, k<sub>a</sub>, dissociation speed k<sub>d </sub>constants and the association K<sub>A </sub>(K<sub>A</sub>=k<sub>A</sub>/kd) and dissociation K<sub>D </sub>(KD=kd/ka) constants at equilibrium.</p>The interactions between the CEA or the CD16 and the VHH (that have a c-myc tag recognised by the monoclonal antibody 9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc) were studied on a BIACORE 3000 equipped with a CM5 biosensor on which the monoclonal antibody 9E10 was covalently immobilized following the standard coupling procedure by the amines proposed by BIACORE (activation by NHS/EDC). The VHH (in buffer: 10 mM HEPES; 150 mM NaCl; 3 mM EDTA; 0.005% surfactant P20) is then injected and then a range of CEA or CD16 is injected on the VHH immobilised on the 9E10. In parallel, the injections are carried out on a control channel that has been subjected to the same coupling chemistry without the injection of protein. The affinities of the VHH are indicated in Table 1 below. Equivalent affinities are obtained from the different formats of bispecific antibodies.</p>TABLE 1ka \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup>kd \u00d7 10<sup>\u22123</sup>KA \u00d7 10<sup>7</sup>KD \u00d7 10<sup>\u22129</sup>VHH(1/Ms)(1/s)(1/M)(M)Anti-CEA 31.24 \u00b1 0.0141.68 \u00b1 0.0027.3813.6Anti-CEA 171.56 \u00b1 0.014\u20021.3 \u00b1 0.002128.3Anti-CEA 251.13 \u00b1 0.014\u20023.6 \u00b1 0.0043.1531.7Anti-CEA 431.78 \u00b1 0.0191.83 \u00b1 0.0029.7210.3Anti-CD16 c130.53 \u00b1 0.07\u20025.67 \u00b1 0.02\u20020.94100.6Anti-CD16 c212.86 \u00b1 0.02\u20022.79 \u00b1 0.00610.39.7Anti-CD16 c280.42 \u00b1 0.03\u20023.45 \u00b1 0.0061.2281.9Anti-CD16 c720.39 \u00b1 0.02\u2002\u20023.7 \u00b1 0.0061.0694.6</p>Analysis by FACS of the Specificity of Anti-CEA and Anti-CD16 VHH and the Corresponding Bispecific Antibodies.</p>Specificity for CEA: (for Effective Immunotargeting, it is Important that the Anti-CEA Antibodies do not Recognise the NCA, a Molecule that is Very Homologous to the CEA that is Expressed at the Surface of the Granulocytes.)</p>The detection of the antigen-antibody bond is carried out on the non-transfected line MC38 (cell line of a murine colon cancer), the lines transfected with the CEA (MC38/CEA<sup>+</sup>) or the NCA (MC38/NCA<sup>+</sup>), the human tumoural line LS174T (cell line of human colon adenocarcinoma expressing the CEA at its surface) and the granulocytes that express the NCA at their surface.</p>The granulocytes are extracted from fresh blood in the presence of heparin, on Ficoll gradient at two densities (Histopaque 1119 and 1077).
