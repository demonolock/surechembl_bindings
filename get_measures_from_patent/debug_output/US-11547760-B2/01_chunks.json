    "ation of 17 mg/mL with a 27-fold molar excess of Linker-1 or Linker-2 in the presence of a final concentration of 2.5% polyethylene glycol with an average molecular weight of 400 Dalton (PEG-400, Spectrum Chemical Mfg. Corp.) and 10% glycerol (Sigma). After 30 minutes incubation at room temperature, the reactions were diluted with Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) to a final cytokine concentration of 1.5 mg/mL. Protein nanogels were then purified from linker leaving groups (which comprise molecular fragments of the linker that are removed as part of the cross-linking reaction) and unreacted linker by buffer exchange into DPBS using a Zeba column (40,000 MW cut-off, Thermo-Fisher). Zeba columns were used according to the manufacturer's instructions, including equilibrating the column in DPBS by three consecutive washes with DPBS to facilitate buffer exchange, followed by application of the reaction products. Buffer-exchanged protein nanogels were analyzed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a BioSep\u2122 SEC-s4000 column (Phenomenex Inc.) with PBS (pH 7.2) as eluent (flow rate 0.5 mL/min) on a Prominence HPLC system equipped with a photodiode array (Shimadzu Corp.).</p>Protein nanogels at a cytokine concentration of approximately 1-1.5 mg/mL were conjugated with a polyethylene glycol-polylysine (PEG-polyK) block co-polymer: PEG5k-polyK30 (Alamanda Polymers cat. no. 050-KC030), which is a block co-polymer comprising a polyethylene glycol polymer of 5 kiloDalton (kD) average molecular weight and a 30 amino acid polylysine polymer (polylysine30 or polyK30). PEG5k-polyK30 or were reconstituted to 1 mg/mL in DPBS and added to 1-1.5 mg/mL of protein nanogels at a final block copolymer concentration of 50 ug/mL and incubated at room temperature for 30 min.</p>T cell expansion analysis. Protein nanogels comprising PEG5k-polyK30 at a protein concentration of 1-1.5 mg/mL were mixed in equal volume with 1\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>CD3+ T-cells in HBSS at a cell concentration of 100\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>cells/mL and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 hr. T-cells were then washed three times with RPMI media containing 10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, and Glutamax (all from ThermoFisher Scientific, Inc.), seeded at a cell density of approximately 1\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>cells/mL, and cultured for 9 days in 24-well tissue culture plates. Cells were split into fresh medium at a ratio of 1:5 on three days after cell attachment of backpacks. Cell proliferation was measured by live-dead cell stain (7-AAD) and counting beads (CountBright Absolute Counting Beads, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) by flow cytometry on Days 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15.</p>As shown in FIG. 4, two Linker-2 cross-linked IL-15 backpack formulations (17HF1 and 17HF2) showed comparable cell expansion with a Linker-1 cross-linked IL-15 backpack formulation (HF6). Mock is negative control with HBSS only.</p>Example 4: Comparison of Linker-1- and Linker-2-Crosslinked IL-15 Backpacks Using Pmel T CellsB16F10 murine melanoma"
