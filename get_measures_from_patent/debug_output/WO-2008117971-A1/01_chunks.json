    " signaling of BLT2\" means to inhibit any step among the binding of LTB4 to BLT2, the activation of BLT2 and its intracellular signaling pathway to induce asthma. The nucleotide sequence of human BLT2 gene is available at the NCBI</p>(NM_019839) and denoted as SEQ ID NO: 1 in this specification. The BLT2 gene has 2 kinds of CDS form, long form CDS (1618-2787) and short form CDS (1711- 2787), of which base sequences are denoted as SEQ ID NO: 2 and SEQ ID NO: 4. The amino acid sequence of the long form BLT2 protein is available at the NCBI (NM_019839) and denoted as SEQ ID NO: 3. The amino acid sequence of the long form BLT2 protein is available at the NCBI (AB029892) and denoted as SEQ ID NO: 5.</p>In a preferred embodiment, the substance may be a compound that binds to BLT2 and inhibits the intracellular signaling of BLT2. The compound is also referred to as BLT2 antagonist, which means a compound that antagonizes an action of</p>LTB4 on BLT2. The compound can be screened according to the present screening method from the commericially available chemical DB.</p>In a preferred embodiment, the compound may be LY255283 (1-[5-ethyl-2- hydroxy-4-[[6-methyl-6-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)heptyl]oxy]phenyl]-ethanone). Figure 1a shows a chemical structure of LY255283. LY255283 is a competitive antagonist of the BLT2 receptor. LY255283 have been known to inhibit eosinophil chemotaxis by 80% at a concentration of 10 \u03bcM, and inhibits the binding of radiolabeled LTB4 to eosinophil membranes with an IC50 of 260 nM [Ann N Y Acad Sci 629 274-287 (1991)]. Also, LY255283 have been known to be a novel leukotriene B4 receptor antagonist, which limits activation of neutrophils and prevents acute lung injury induced by endotoxin in pigs [Surgery. 1993 Aug;114(2):191-8] . However, the anti- asthma activity of LY25583 was revealed by the present inventors for the first time.</p>In a preferred embodiment, the substance may be an antibody to BLT2 that inhibits the intracellular signaling of BLT2. The antibody binds to BLT2 competitively with LTB4, so that can inhibit the intracellular signaling of BLT2. The antibody can \n\n be produced according to the conventional methods for producing polyclonal or monoclonal antibody by using BLT2 or its fragment as an antigen.</p>In a preferred embodiment, the substance may be an antisense or siRNA oligonucleotide that inhibits the expression of BLT2. The antisense or siRNA oligonucleotide has a base sequence complementary to the nucleotide sequence of BLT2 mRNA as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2.</p>The term \"antisense oligonucleotide\" used herein is intended to refer to nucleic acids, preferably, DNA, RNA or its derivatives, that are complementary to the base sequences of a target mRNA, characterized in that they binds to the target mRNA and interfere its translation to protein. The antisense oligonucleotide of this invention means DNA or RNA sequences complementary and binding to BLT2 mRNA, that are able to inhibit translation, translocation, matura"
