Pramlintide has a safety profile in the clinical use for diabetes.</p>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONAmylin is a peptide hormone associated with metabolism and glucose regulation, and its analog, pramlintide, is used clinically and has been shown to reduce post-prandial plasma glucose concentrations. The data provided herein demonstrate the discovery that amylin or an amylin analog can serve as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease and other conditions relating to increased A\u03b2 peptide in the brain. These data demonstrate that repeated administration of amylin or an amylin analog has long-term effects on acquisition and retention of memory, thus indicating that amylin or amylin analog administration can be used for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and conditions relating to increased A\u03b2 peptide in the brain.</p>In particular, the inventors have determined using amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice that peripheral injection of amylin can remove A\u03b2 from the brain into blood in APP transgenic mice, and that this activity is through the amylin receptor. It",
    "se there is little or no A\u03b2 peptide in their brains.</p>Also provided herein, in some aspects, are amylin and amylin analogs for neural imaging purposes. As described herein, the inventors have determined that amylin can traverse the blood brain barrier, and interacts with the amylin receptor (calcitonin receptor (CTR) and receptor activity modifying protein 3 (RAMP3) or CTR/RAMP3) and IDE (insulin degrading enzyme in the brain). Thus, compositions comprising amylin and amylin analogs can be used for neural imaging purposes if suitably labeled, for example, and in assays thereof.</p>Thus, the assays, methods, and kits described herein provide similar platforms for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's and amnestic MCI to those used in glucose tolerance tests, in which only patients having diabetes show abnormalities after a challenge with glucose is given, but not non-diabetic subjects. Further, amylin and amylin analogs are already safely used in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, as explained elsewhere herein. Accordingly, the assays, methods, and tests described herein can be used to reduce the cost to screen for risk for AD, and are less invasive and more acceptable to AD patients than, for example, the lumbar puncture test currently used to obtain cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) or PET imaging. These assays and methods for diagnosis of A\u03b2 peptide related conditions can further be combined with the treatment methods described herein to provide theranostic methods for the diagnosis and inhibition or improvement of patients suffering from A\u03b2 peptide-mediated disorders, like Alzheimer's.</p>Amyloid Diseases and Alzheimer's DiseaseThe compositions, methods and assays described herein are useful for the treatment and diagnosis of amyloid diseases mediated by A(peptide. \u201cAmyloidosis,\u201d as used herein, refers to a condition found in a variety of diseases that is characterized by an accumulation of amyloid material in the organs or tissues of the body. This accumulation can impair vital functions. \u201cAmyloid,\u201d as used herein, is a term referring to a group of diverse but specific extracellular protein deposits that all have common morphological properties, staining characteristics, and X-ray diffraction spectra. Regardless of the nature of the amyloid protein deposited, amyloids have the following characteristics: 1) showing an amorphous appearance at the light microscopic level, appearing eosinophilic using hematoxylin and eosin stains; 2) staining with Congo red and demonstrating a red/green birefringence as viewed under polarized light (Puchtler et al., J. Histochem. Cytochem. 10:355-364, 1962); 3) containing a predominant beta-pleated sheet secondary structure; and 4) ultrastructurally comprising non-branching fibrils of indefinite length and with a diameter of 7-10 nm.</p>Amyloidoses are classified according to the specific amyloid protein deposited. The amyloids include, but are not limited to, \u201cbeta-amyloid protein\u201d or \u201cA\u03b2,\u201d the amyloid associated with Alzheim",
    " the heart can lead to heart failure. For these patients, amyloid accumulation in systemic organs leads to eventual death generally within 3-5 years.</p>Other amyloidoses can affect a single organ or tissue such as observed with the A\u03b2 amyloid deposits found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease and Down's syndrome: the PrP amyloid deposits found in the brains of patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome, and kuru; the islet amyloid (amylin) deposits found in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas of 90% of patients with type II diabetes (Johnson et al, N. Engl. J. Med. 321:513-518, 1989; Lab. Invest. 66:522 535, 1992); \u03b22-microglobulin amyloid deposits in the medial nerve leading to carpal tunnel syndrome as observed in patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis (Geyjo et al, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 129:701-706, 1985; Kidney Int. 30:385-390, 1986); the prealbumin/transthyretin amyloid observed in the hearts of patients with senile cardiac amyloid; and the prealbumin/transthyretin amyloid observed in peripheral nerves of patients who have familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (Skinner and Cohen, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 99:1326-1332, 1981; Saraiva et al, J. Lab. Clin. Med. 102:590-603, 1983; J. Clin. Invest. 74:104-119, 1984; Tawara et al, J. Lab. Clin. Med. 98:811-822, 1989).</p>A number of impairments specific to amyloid deposits in the brain are linked with the deposition of the peptide, A\u03b2 peptide (amyloid-(peptide), a 4 kD protein, 39-43 amino acids long. A\u03b2 peptide is expressed by a gene located on chromosome 21. A\u03b2 is formed after sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a transmembrane glycoprotein that is much larger (770 amino acid residues). APP can be processed by \u03b1-, \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretases; A\u03b2 protein is generated by successive action of the \u03b2 and \u03b3 secretases. The \u03b3 secretase, which produces the C-terminal end of the A\u03b2 peptide, cleaves within the transmembrane region of APP and can generate a number of isoforms of 36-43 amino acid residues in length. As used herein, the terms \u201cA\u03b2 peptide\u201d or \u201cA\u03b2\u201d refer to the peptides generated by the successive action of the \u03b2 and \u03b3 secretases, such as A\u03b240 and A\u03b242. The most common isoforms are A\u03b240 and A\u03b242. The shorter form, A\u03b240 (DAEFRHDSGYEVHHQKLVFFAEDVGSNKGAIIGLMVGGVV; SEQ ID NO: 1) is typically produced by cleavage that occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum. The the longer form, A\u03b242, (DAEFRHDSGYEVHHQKLVFFAEDVGSNKGAIIGLMVGGVVIA; SEQ ID NO: 2) is produced by cleavage in the trans-Golgi network. The A\u03b240 form is the more common of the two, but A\u03b242 is the more fibrillogenic and is thus associated with disease states. Mutations in APP associated with early-onset Alzheimer's have been noted to increase the relative production of A\u03b242. Neurological diseases associated with A\u03b2 peptide deposition, amenable for treatment with the methods and diagnostic assays described herein, include Alzheimer's, Lewy body dementia, Down's Syndrome, ",
    "characterized by a dichroic appearance, exhibiting a yellow-green polarization color. The dichroic binding is the result of the beta-pleated sheet structure of the amyloid proteins.</p>In addition to Alzheimer's, the compositions, methods, and assays described herein can also be used for patients having \u201camnestic mild cognitive impairment\u201d (\u201caMCI\u201d), which is a prodromal phase of Alzheimer's that has a fairly high rate of conversion to Alzheimer's disease. People with aMCI experience significant memory impairment; however, they tend to retain their other cognitive functions. This allows them to keep their independence and live day-to-day without major disruption. aMCI patients also typically respond well to rehabilitation and cognitive aids to restore their memory breakdown.</p>Amylin or Insulin Amyloid Polypeptide and Agonist Peptides ThereofAs demonstrated herein, the inventors have discovered that the glucoregulatory hormone amylin and its analogs are useful in the treatment and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and other disorders that are mediated by deposition of A\u03b2 peptide. Amylin, which is also referred to herein as \u201cInsulin Amyloid Polypeptide\u201d (TAP), is a hormone that is co-secreted with insulin from pancreatic \u03b2 cells and has been shown to have numerous metabolic effects, including glucoregulatory actions. The glucoregulatory actions of amylin are related to its effects on gastric emptying, suppression of inappropriately elevated postprandial glucagon secretion, and inhibition of food intake (Young (1997) Curr. Opin. in Endocrinology and Diabetes 4:282-290). Amylin is believed to aid in limiting glycemic excursions by slowing gastric emptying, promoting satiety, and inhibiting inappropriate secretion of glucagon, a catabolic hormone that opposes the effects of insulin and amylin. SYMLIN\u2122 (pramlintide acetate) is a synthetic analog of Amylin that has been approved by the FDA for use in the the treatment of type 1 and 2 diabetes (Baron et al. (2002) Curr. Drug Targets Immune Endocr. Metabol. Disord. 2:63-82). Amylin agonists include amylin agonist analogs, examples of which are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,686,411; U.S. Pat. No. 6,610,824; U.S. Pat.

The \u201camylin agonist compounds\u201d can be derived from natural sources, can be synthetic, or can be derived from recombinant DNA techniques. Amylin agonist peptides have amylin agonist receptor binding activity and can comprise amino acids (e.g., natural, unnatural, or a combination thereof), peptide mimetics, chemical moieties, and the like. The skilled artisan can recognize amylin agonist compounds using amylin receptor binding assays or by measuring amylin agonist activity in soleus muscle assays. In some embodiments, amylin agonist compounds have an IC<sub>50 </sub>of about 200 or less, about 100 or less, or about 50 or less, in an amylin receptor binding assay, such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,686,411, US Publication No. 2008/0176804, and US Publication No. 20120071401, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.

Unless otherwise stated, reference to \u201camylin\u201d includes amylin and amylin analogs having similar function and structure that can be used in the assays and methods described herein.</p>The nomenclature for the compounds described herein is used to indicate (1) the peptide that the amino acid sequence is based on and (2) the modifications that have been made to",
    " compositions comprising amylin or amylin analogs described herein will be determined by the age, weight, and condition or severity of the A\u03b2 deposition or plaques of the subject, which can be determined, for example, using the methods described herein. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 697-773. See also Wang and Hanson, Parenteral Formulations of Proteins and Peptides: Stability and Stabilizers, Journal of Parenteral Science and Technology, Technical Report No. 10, Supp. 42:2 S (1988). Typically, a dosage of between about 0.001 \u03bcg/kg body weight/day to about 1000 \u03bcg/kg body weight/day, can be used, but more or less, as a skilled practitioner will recognize, can be used. Dosing can be one or more times daily, or less frequently, and can be in conjunction with other compositions as described herein. It should be noted that the compositions and methods described herein are not limited to the dosages recited herein. The final dosage regimen will be determined by the attending physician, considering factors that modify the action of drugs, e.g., the drug's specific activity, severity of the damage and the responsiveness of the patient, the age, condition, body weight, sex and diet of the patient, the severity of any infection, time of administration and other clinical factors. As studies are conducted, further information will emerge regarding appropriate dosage levels and duration of treatment using the amylin or amylin analogs described herein for the reduction or inhibition of A\u03b2 deposition or plaque formation in the brain.</p>An effective dose will typically be in the range of about 1 to 30 \u03bcg to about 5 mg/day, preferably about 10 to 30 \u03bcg to about 2 mg/day and more preferably about 5 to 100 \u03bcg to about 1 mg/day, most preferably about 5 \u03bcg to about 500 \u03bcg/day, administered in a single or divided doses. The dosages can be between about 0.01 to about 500 \u03bcg/dose. It is contemplated that the amylin or amylin analog compounds described herein can be administered 1, 2, 3, 4 or more times a day. Accordingly, exemplary doses can be derived from the total amount of drug to be given a day and the number doses administered a day. For example, exemplary doses can range from about 0.125 \u03bcg/dose (0.5 \u03bcg given four times a day) to about 5 mg/dose (5 mg given once a day). Other dosages can be between about 0.01 to about 100 \u03bcg/kg/dose. Still other exemplary doses may be 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, or 200 \u03bcg/dose. The exact dose to be administered can be determined by one of skill in the art and is dependent upon the potency of the particular compound, as well as upon the age, weight and condition of the individual. Administration should begin whenever the reduction or inhibit of A\u03b2 deposition or plaque formation in the brains desired, for example, at the first sign of symptoms or shortly after diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or amnestic MCI. Administration can be by any route, e.g., injection,",
