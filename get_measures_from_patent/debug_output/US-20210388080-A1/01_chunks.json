    "inding lectin-associated serine protease-1, -2 and -3 (MASP-1, MASP-2 and MASP-3, respectively)), which have been taught to play a significant role in modulation of the lectin pathway of complement activation. Petersen et al., Molecular Immunology 38:133-149 (2001).</p>MASP-1 has a histidine loop structure of the type found in trypsin and trypsin-like serine proteases. MASP-1 has been found to be involved in complement activation by MBL. A cDNA clone encoding MASP-1 has been reported that encodes a putative leader peptide of 19 amino acids followed by 680 amino acid residues predicted to form the mature peptide. MASP-2 (MBL-associated serine protease 2) is a serine protease also similar in structure to Cl r and Cl s of the complement pathway. Like these, and contrary to MASP-1, it has no histidine loop structure of the type found in trypsin and trypsin-like serine proteases. It has been theorized that MASP-1 can cleave C3, generating C3b, which may be deposited on an activated cell or tissue surface.</p>It has been shown that MASP-2, cleaves C4 and C2, giving rise to the C3 convertase, C4b2b (Thiel et al., Nature, 386:506-10 (1997)). The MASP-2 protein comprises of a number of domains namely the CUB1, EGF, CUB2, CCP1, CCP2 and serine protease domains. It is believed that the domain responsible for association with MBL is situated in the N-terminus, whereas the serine protease domain is responsible for the serine protease activity of MASP-2. sMAP, also known as MAp19, is a 19 kd is derived from the same gene as MASP-2, which lacks the serine protease domain and a major part of the A chain. Skjoedt et al., Immunobiology, 215:921-31 (2010). Recently, a third member of the family, MASP-3 was identified, which shares a high degree of homology with MASP-1, such that it appears that MASP-1 and MASP-3 are generated as a result of alternative splicing of primary mRNA transcripts.</p>Antibodies against MBL, MASP-1, MASP-2, MASP-3 and the MBL/MASP complex, and their use for inhibiting the adverse effects of complement activation, such as ischemia-reperfusion injury, have been disclosed, for example, in WO04/075837; US 2009/0017031.</p>Other antibodies to MASP-2 have been described previously, as well. See, e.g., WO 02/06460, US2007/0009528, Peterson et al., Mol. Immunol. 37:803-11 (2000), Moller-Kristensen et al., J. of Immunol. Methods 282:159-67 (2003). Petersen et al., Mol. Immunol. 35:409, and WO 04/106384.</p>An additional related protein, MBL/Ficolin Associated Protein (MAP-1), which is present in low serum levels compared to MASP-1 and MASP-3, has been reported to function as a local lectin pathway specific complement inhibitor. Skjodt et al., Molecular Immunology, 47:2229-30 (2010). Accordingly MAP-1 itself, or fragments of MAP-1, may be useful in the present invention as an inhibitor of MASP, and accordingly, as a lectin-pathway-specific inhibitor of complement activation. Finally, the ficolin family of proteins are characterized by carbohydrate bi",
    " month, once every two months, once every three months, or once every six months. The compositions may also be administered in a sustained release formulation, such as in an implant which gradually releases the composition for use over a period of time, and which allows for the composition to be administered less frequently, such as once a month, once every 2-6 months, once every year, or even a single administration. The sustained release devices (such as pellets, nanoparticles, microparticles, nanospheres, microspheres, and the like) may be administered by injection or surgical implanted in various locations in the eye or tissue associated with the eye, such as intraocular, intravitreal, subretinal, periocular, subconjunctival, or sub-tenons.</p>The antibody (or antigen-binding fragment thereof) and/or construct (e.g., a targeting construct) compositions (e.g., pharmaceutical compositions) can be administered alone or in combination with other molecules known to have a beneficial effect on retinal attachment or damaged retinal tissue, including molecules capable of tissue repair and regeneration and/or inhibiting inflammation. Examples of useful cofactors include anti-VEGF agents (such as an antibody against VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), axokine (a mutein of CNTF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), neutrotrophin 3 (NT-3), neurotrophin-4 (NT-4), nerve growth factor (NGF), insulin-like growth factor 11, prostaglandin E2, 30 kD survival factor, taurine, and vitamin A. Other useful cofactors include symptom-alleviating cofactors, including antiseptics, antibiotics, antiviral and antifungal agents and analgesics and anesthetics.</p>Gene Therapy</p>The targeting constructs can also be delivered by expression of the targeting construct fusion protein in vivo, which is often referred to as \u201cgene therapy\u201d. For example, cells may be engineered with a polynucleotide (DNA or RNA) encoding for the fusion protein ex vivo, the engineered cells are then provided to an individual to be treated with the fusion protein. Such methods are well-known in the art. For example, cells may be engineered by procedures known in the art by use of a retroviral particle containing RNA encoding for the fusion protein of the present invention.</p>Local delivery of the targeting construct of the present invention using gene therapy may provide the therapeutic agent to the target area, for example to the eye or the eye tissue.</p>The an antibodies (or antigen-binding fragments thereof) and/or constructs (e.g., a targeting constructs) can also be delivered by expression of the antibody and/or targeting construct in vivo, which is often referred to as \u201cgene therapy\u201d.
