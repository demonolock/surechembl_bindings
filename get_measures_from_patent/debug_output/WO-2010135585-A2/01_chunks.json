    " an immunologically-effective amount is an amount sufficient to induce an immune response in the subject.</p>As used herein, an \"immune response\" is the physiological response of the subject's immune system to an immunizing composition. An immune response may include an innate immune response, an adaptive immune response, or both. In some embodiments of the present invention, the immune response is a protective immune response, A protective immune response confers immunological cellular \n\n memory upon the subject, with the effect that a secondary exposure to the same or a similar antigen is characterized by one or more of the following characteristics: shorter lag phase than the lag phase resulting from exposure to the selected antigen in the absence of prior exposure to the immunizing composition; production of antibody which continues for a longer period than production of antibody resulting from exposure to the selected antigen in the absence of prior exposure to the immunizing composition; a change in the type and quality of antibody produced in comparison to the type and quality of antibody produced upon exposure to the selected antigen in the absence of prior exposure to the immunizing composition; a shift in class response, with IgG antibodies appearing in higher concentrations and with greater persistence than IgM, than occurs in response to exposure to the selected antigen in the absence of prior exposure to the immunizing composition; an increased average affinity (binding constant) of the antibodies for the antigen in comparison with the average affinity of antibodies for the antigen resulting from exposure to the selected antigen in the absence of prior exposure to the immunizing composition; and/or other characteristics known in the art to characterize a secondary immune response.</p>In some embodiments, the vaccines of the invention are administered with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such that it provides host immunity against an infection.</p>The term \"carrier\" denotes an organic or inorganic ingredient, natural or synthetic, with which the active ingredient is combined to facilitate the application of the vaccine. The characteristics of the carrier depend on the nature of the vaccine and the route of administration. Physiologically and pharmaceutically- acceptable carriers include diluents, fillers, salts, buffers, stabilizers, solubilizers, and other materials. The term \"pharmaceutically acceptable\" is used to refer to a non-toxic material that is compatible with a biological system such as a cell, cell culture, tissue, or organism.</p>In practicing immunization protocols for treatment and/or prevention, an immunologically-effective amount of type IV pilin or a variant or antigenic fragment thereof is administered to a subject. The particular dosage depends upon \n\n the age, weight, sex and medical condition of the subject to be treated, as well as on the method of administration.</p>The vaccines of the invention can be a"
