The majority of antibodies displayed neutralization potency in the picomolar range (pM), with some exhibiting neutralization potency in nanomolar (nM) range.</p>While recombinant ACE2 was able to mediate neutralization of the VSV-spike pseudoparticles, as previously reported, its potency was far inferior to that of the monoclonal antibodies, with more than 1000-fold decrease in potency seen relative to the best neutralizing mAbs (FIG. 10A). In addition, the potent neutralizing activity of mAb10987, mAb10989, mAb10933, and mAb10934 was confirmed in neutralization assays, including neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 in VeroE6 cells (FIG. 10B). All neutralization assays generated similar potency across the four mAbs (mAb10987, mAb10989, mAb10933, and mAb10934) and no combinations demonstrated synergistic neutralization activity (FIG. 10B).</p>TABLE 29mAb neutralization potency (IC50 (M)) against wild-type strain of VSV-SARS-cells CoV-2-S pseudoparticles in VeroAntibodyIC50 (M)mAb109345.44E\u221211mAb109361.11E\u221210mAb109874.06E\u221211mAb109241.36E\u221210mAb109352.21E\u221210mAb109132.31E\u221210mAb109392.36E\u221210mAb109372.62E\u221210mAb109202.64E\u221210mAb109412.78E\u221210mAb109233.29E\u221210mAb109153.40E\u221210mAb109323.58E\u221210mAb109213.74E\u221210mAb109143.94E\u221210mAb109405.43E\u221210mAb109897.23E\u221212mAb109386.65E\u221210mAb109221.21E\u221210mAb109301.07E\u221209mAb109549.22E\u221211mAb109551.19E\u221210mAb109334.28E\u221211mAb109561.28E\u221210mAb109571.76E\u221210mAb109645.70E\u221211mAb109651.42E\u221210mAb109661.00E\u221210mAb109672.43E\u221210mAb109701.26E\u221210mAb109711.55E\u221210mAb109775.15E\u221211mAb109823.69E\u221210mAb109849.73E\u221211mAb109852.57E\u221210mAb109869.91E\u221211mAb109882.98E\u221210mAb109692.27E\u221209mAb109961.13E\u221208mAb109989.51E\u221209mAb11002non-neutralizingmAb110002.79E\u221208mAb110046.00E\u221209mAb110061.40E\u221209mAb110082.05E\u221208mAb11010non-neutralizing</p>Amino acid variants in spike (S) protein were identified from over 7000 publicly available SARS-CoV-2 sequences, representing globally circulating isolates, and cloned into VSV pseudoparticles. Neutralization assays with variant-encoding pseudoparticles were performed to assess the impact of each variant on neutralization potency of the monoclonal antibodies. Table 30 illustrates the relative neutralization potency of monoclonal antibodies against variant encoding pseudoparticles relative to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S-wt) at a single concentration of 5 \u03bcg/ml. Percent of neutralization relative to S-wt was captured for each individual antibody and variant. None of the antibodies demonstrated loss of neutralization potency at the 5 \u03bcg/ml concentration with the exception of mAb10985 and the R408I variant. These data demonstrate broad functional neutralization coverage of monoclonal antibodies against globally circulating SARS-CoV-2 spike variants.</p>To further interrogate the impact of the S protein variants on neutralization potency of the monoclonal antibodies, full neutralization curves were run to determine the IC50 value of the most potent neutralizing antibodies against a subset of variants localized within the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein. Table 31 shows the IC50 neutralization values for each variant psuedoparticle. Intrinsic variability of up to 3-fold can be observed between pseudoparticle neutralization assays and does not indicate a change in neutralization potency. These data demonstrate that the antibodies retained their neutralization potency against a diverse panel of S protein RBD variants.</p>TABLE 30Relative neutralization of VSV-SARS-CoV-2 variants encoding S protein at 5 \u03bcg/ml antibody concentration in Vero cellsmAbwtH49YS50LV341IN354DS359NV367FK378RmAb10989100%100%\u200288%100%100%\u200299%100%100%mAb10987100%100%\u200296%\u200299%100%\u200299%100%100%mAb10933100%100%\u200296%\u200299%100%\u200299%100%\u200299%mAb10977100%100%\u200298%100%\u200299%100%100%100%mAb10934100%100%\u200295%100%100%\u200299%100%\u200299%mAb10964100%100%\u200290%100%\u200299%\u200299%100%100%mAb10954100%100%\u200292%100%100%\u200299%100%100%mAb10984100%100%\u200295%100%\u200299%\u200299%100%\u200299%mAb10986100%100%\u200298%100%\u200299%\u200299%100%100%mAb10966100%100%\u200290%100%\u200299%\u200299%100%100%mAb10936100%100%\u200296%100%\u200299%\u200299%100%100%mAb10955100%100%\u200295%\u200299%\u200299%\u200299%100%100%mAb10922100%100%\u200298%\u200299%\u200299%\u200299%100%\u200299%mAb10970100%100%\u200299%100%100%100%100%\u200299%mAb10956100%100%\u200296%\u200299%\u200299%\u200299%100%100%mAb10924100%100%\u200296%100%\u200299%\u200299%100%\u200299%mAb10965100%100%\u200296%100%\u200299%100%100%100%mAb10971100%100%\u200290%\u200299%\u200299%\u200299%100%\u200299%mAb10957100%100%\u200291%\u200299%\u200299%\u200298%100%\u200299%mAb10935100% NRNRNRNR\u200299%NR\u200299%mAb10913100%100%\u200293%100%\u200299%\u200298%100%\u200299%mAb10939100%100%\u200293%\u200298%\u200299%100%100%\u200299%mAb10967100%100%\u200290%\u200299%\u200299%\u200298%100%100%mAb10985100%100%\u200296%\u200299%\u200299%\u200298%100%\u200299%mAb10937100%100%\u200292%\u200299%100%\u200298%10",

All binding studies were performed in 10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, and 0.05% v/v Surfactant Tween-20, pH 7.4 (THBS-ET) running buffer at 25\u00b0 C. and 37\u00b0 C. The Biacore CM5 sensor chip surface was first derivatized by amine coupling with either mouse anti-human Fc specific mAb (Regeneron, mAb2567) to capture anti-SARS-COV-2bmAbs. Binding studies were performed on human SARS-COV-2 RBD extracellular domain expressed with a C-terminal myc-myc-hexahistidine (SARS-COV-2 RBD-MMH) and SARS-COV-2 RBD extracellular domain expressed with a C-terminal mouse IgG2a (SARS-COV-2 RBD-mFc). Use of these reagents allowed for the testing of the antibodies' ability to bind monomeric and dimeric RBD peptides, respectively.</p>Different concentrations of hSARS-COV-2 RBD-MMH, (90 nM-3.33 nM, 3-fold dilution) and SARS-COV-2 RBD-mFc (30 nM-1.11 nM 3-fold dilution) prepared in HBS-ET running buffer, were injected for 3 minutes at a flow rate of 50 \u03bcL/min while the dissociation of mAb bound different SARS-COV-2 RBD reagents was monitored for 6-10 minutes in HBS-ET running buffer. At the end of each cycle, the SARS-COV-2 RBD mAb capture surface was regenerated using either 12 sec injection of 20 mM phosphoric acid for mouse anti-human Fc specific mAb surface. The association rate (k<sub>a</sub>) and dissociation rate (k<sub>d</sub>) were determined by fitting the real-time binding sensorgrams to a 1:1 binding model with mass transport limitation using BiaEvaluation software v3.1 or Biacore Insight Evaluation software v2.0. or curve-fitting software. Binding dissociation equilibrium constant (K<sub>D</sub>) and dissociative half-life (t\u00bd) were calculated from the kinetic rates as:</p>KD\u2061(M)=k\u2062dk\u2062a,and\u2062\u2062t1\u2062/2\u2061(min)=ln\u2061(2)60\u22c6kd</p>Binding kinetics parameters for different SARS-COV-2 mAbs binding to different anti-SARS-COV-2 RBD reagents of the invention at 25\u00b0 C. and 37\u00b0 C. are shown in Tables 32 through 35, respectively.</p>TABLE 32Binding kinetics parameters of SARS-COV-2 RBD-MMH binding to anti-SARS-COV-2-S monoclonal antibodies at 25\u00b0 C.mAbmAb90 nM AgCapturedCaptureBoundk<sub>a</sub>k<sub>d</sub>KDt\u00bd(mAb #)Level (RU)(RU)(1/Ms)(V)(M)(min)mAb10913287 \u00b1 355.94.04E+052.12E\u2212025.26E\u2212080.5mAb10914310 \u00b1 251.18.81E+043.76E\u2212034.26E\u2212083.1mAb10915310 \u00b1 263.29.61E+041.08E\u2212041.13E\u221209106.9mAb10920307 \u00b1 373.94.52E+051.30E\u2212022.87E\u2212080.9mAb10921307 \u00b1 361.41.01E+054.75E\u2212044.71E\u22120924.3mAb10922312.2 \u00b1 1.7120.26.14E+051.48E\u2212032.41E\u2212097.8mAb10923283 \u00b1 280.44.66E+056.17E\u2212031.32E\u2212081.9mAb10924319 \u00b1 294.62.07E+051.74E\u2212038.40E\u2212096.6mAb10930284.7 \u00b1 0.759.61.24E+053.34E\u2212032.70E\u2212083.5mAb10932315 \u00b1 379.48.99E+041.21E\u2212041.35E\u22120995.5mAb10933280 \u00b1 199.81.52E+062.78E\u2212031.83E\u2212094.2mAb10934280 \u00b1 1103.44.82E+065.77E\u2212031.20E\u2212092.0mAb10935337 \u00b1 2107.83.93E+054.19E\u2212031.07E\u2212082.8mAb10936311 \u00b1 2107.35.45E+051.07E\u2212031.97E\u22120910.8mAb10937311 \u00b1 2102.25.72E+054.76E\u2212038.34E\u2212092.4mAb10938338 \u00b1 361.57.27E+041.75E\u2212042.41E\u22120966.0mAb10939343 \u00b1 282.31.63E+052.84E\u2212031.74E\u2212084.1mAb10940338 \u00b1 3103.58.01E+052.51E\u2212033.13E\u2212094.6mAb10941327 \u00b1 1 92.11.20E+054.12E\u2212043.43E\u22120928.0mAb10954286.9 \u00b1 3\u2002\u2009110.54.04E+053.64E\u2212048.99E\u22121031.7mAb10955298.3 \u00b1 2.588.81.61E+052.12E\u2212031.32E\u2212085.4mAb10956293.7 \u00b1 0.686.62.22E+054.06E\u2212031.82E\u2212082.8mAb10957286.7 \u00b1 2\u2002\u200993.01.38E",

    "ed with the Fc portion of the human IgG1 at the c-terminus (SARS-CoV-2 RBD-hFc) The human ACE2 protein used in the experiments was purchased from R&amp;D Systems and was comprised of amino acids Gln18-Ser740 with a C-terminal OX-Histidine tag (hACE2-His; NCBI Accession No. Q9BYF1).</p>Experiments were carried out using the following procedure. A monoclonal anti-Penta-His antibody (Qiagen) was coated at 1 \u03bcg/ml in PBS on a 96-well microtiter plate overnight at 4\u00b0 C. The hACE2-His receptor was added at 0.2 ug/ml in PBS and bound for two hours at room temperature (RT). Nonspecific binding sites were subsequently blocked using a 0.5% (w/v) solution of BSA in PBS. In other microtiter plates, a constant amount of 100 pM of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-hFc protein was bound with anti-SARS-COV-2 antibodies and an isotype IgG1 antibody control at dilutions from 0.0008 nM to 50 nM in PBS+0.5% BSA. After a one-hour incubation, the mixture solutions were transferred to the microtiter plate coated hACE2-His. After 1.5 hours of incubation at RT, the wells were washed, and plate-bound SARS-COV2 was detected with goat-anti-human IgG antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Jackson). The plates were then developed using TMB substrate solution (BD Biosciences, #555214) according to manufacturer's recommendation and absorbance at 450 nm was measured on a Victor X5 plate reader.</p>Binding data were analyzed using a sigmoidal dose-response model within Prism\u2122 software (GraphPad). The calculated IC50 value, defined as the concentration of antibody required to block 50% of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-hFc binding to plate-coated hACE2-His, was used as an indicator of blocking potency. Percent blocking was defined based on the background-corrected binding signal observed at the highest antibody concentration tested using this formula and reported for all tested antibodies:</p>%\u2062\u2062Blocking=100-([Experimental\u2062\u2062\u2062Signal(highest\u2062\u2062Ab\u2062\u2062conc)-Background\u2062\u2062Signal(buffer)][Maximum\u2062\u2062\u2062Signal(hEGF.mFc\u2062\u2062alone)-Background\u2062\u2062Signal(buffer)]\u2a2f100)</p>Antibodies that blocked binding less than or equal to 50 at the highest concentration tested were classified as non-blockers and IC50 values were not reported for those antibodies.</p>The ability of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to block SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to human ACE2 was assessed using a blocking ELISA. In this assay 100 pM SARS-COV-2 RBD-hFc was titrated with a wide range of the concentrations of the anti-SARS-CoV-2-S antibody and the inhibition of the presence of the antibody on RBD binding to hACE2-His was evaluated. The plate-bound RBD-hFc was detected with an HRP conjugated anti-hFc antibody.</p>The blocking IC50s and maximum blocking at the highest tested concentrations of the anti-SARS-CoV-2-S antibodies are summarized in Table 36, and the blocking curves shown in FIGS. 1-8. Of the 46 antibodies tested, 44 displayed antibody concentration-dependent blocking of RBD.hFc binding to hACE-2. IC50 values ranged from 41 pM to 4.5 nM and maximum blocking ranging from 55% to about 100% at the highest antibody concentration tested. Two antibodies out of 46 tested showed no blocking activities under the assay conditions. The irrelevant isotype control antibody showed no blocking activity, as expected.</p>TABLE 36Blocking potency of Anti-SAR-COV-2 Antibodies on Spike RBD-hFc Binding to Immobilized Human ACE-2Blocking100 pMBlocking 100 pM(RBD).hFc toAssay(RBD).hFc toACE2 %mAbRun #ACE2 IC<sub>50</sub>,MBlockingmAb1091312.17E\u22121080mAb1091419.80E\u22121093mAb1091513.21E\u22121099mAb1092013.38E\u22121095mAb1092031.39E\u22121087mAb1092114.33E\u22121099mAb1092135.07E\u22121094mAb1092226.65E\u22121197mAb1092311.49E\u22121094mAb1092331.84E\u22121085mAb1092411.63E\u22121098mAb1092421.27E\u22121098mAb1093022.82E\u22121086mAb1093213.73E\u22121099mAb1093317.07E\u22121199mAb1093336.53E\u22121195mAb1093325.22E\u221211101mAb1093416.60E\u22121196mAb1093435.97E\u22121198mAb1093424.80E\u22121196mAb1093511.02E\u22121099mAb1093526.94E\u22121198mAb1093618.75E\u22121195mAb1093627.10E\u22121197mAb1093716.49E\u22121199mAb1093812.75E\u22121099mAb1093911.75E\u22121097mAb1093932.63E\u22121093mAb1094016.52E\u22121192mAb1094112.27E\u221210100mAb1094122.06E\u221210100mAb1095427.11E\u22121195mAb1095521.41E\u22121097mAb1095621.85E\u22121099mAb1095721.69E\u22121099mAb1096436.83E\u22121193mAb1096426.25E\u22121195mAb1096522.13E\u22121097mAb1096621.60E\u22121099mAb1096722.80E\u22121098mAb1096932.15E\u22121095mAb1097021.07E\u22121097mAb1097121.49E\u22121098mAb1097738.71E\u22121177mAb1097727.11E\u22121165mAb1098221.16E\u22121093mAb1098427.75E\u22121190mAb1098536.96E\u22121197mAb1098524.11E\u22121199mAb1098627.54E\u22121198mAb1098732.85E\u22121093mAb10987",
    " Antibodies Binding to Monomeric SARS-CoV-2-S RBD Reagents Measured at 37\u00b0 C.The dissociation rate constants (k<sub>d</sub>) for different anti-SARS-CoV-2-S monoclonal antibodies in pH 7.4, pH 6.0, and pH5.0 buffers were determined using a real-time surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based Biacore T200 biosensor. All binding studies were performed at 37\u00b0 C. using three running buffers, (i) PBS, 0.05% v/v Surfactant Tween-20, pH7.4 (PBS-T-pH7.4) (ii) PBS, 0.05% v/v Surfactant Tween-20, pH6.0 (PBS-T-pH6.0), and (iii) PBS, 0.05% v/v Surfactant Tween-20, pH5.0 (PBS-T-pH5.0). The Biacore CM5 sensor chip surface was first derivatized by amine coupling with a mouse anti-human Fc specific mAb (Regeneron) to capture anti-SARS-CoV-2-S monoclonal antibodies. Binding studies were performed on human SARS-COV-2-S RBD extracellular domain expressed with a C-terminal myc-myc-hexahistidine (SARS-COV-2 RBD-MMH), Single concentrations of SARS-COV-2-S RBD-MMH (90 nM) prepared in PBS-T-pH 7.4 buffer were injected at a flow rate of 25 \u03bcL/min for 3 minutes followed by the dissociation of bound SARS-COV-2-S RBD-MMH in PBS-T-pH 7.4, PBS-T-pH 6.0 or PBS-T PBS-T-pH 5.0 running buffers for 5 minutes.</p>The dissociation rate constants (k<sub>d</sub>) in four pH running buffers were determined by fitting the real-time binding sensorgrams to a 1:1 binding model using Scrubber 2.0c curve-fitting software.

Parental Jurkat/Tet3G/hCD2/Tet-3G were also included in the experiments as a negative binding control.</p>Experiments were carried out according to following procedure. Cells from the two lines described above were induced with 1 \u03bcg/ml doxycycline at 37\u00b0 C. for 36 hours prior to harvest, spun down, washed with PBS, then diluted in PBS, seeded into the 96-well carbon electrode plates (MULTI-ARRAY high bind plate, MSD), and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0 C. to allow the cells to adhere. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by 2% BSA (w/v) in PBS for one hour at room temperature. To the plate-bound cells, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and a non-binding human IgG1 control, diluted in PBS+0.5% BSA at a range of concentrations from 0.0008 nM to 50 nM, and buffer with no antibody were added in duplicate and the plates incubated for one hour at room temperature with shaking. The plates were then washed with 1\u00d7PBS to remove the unbound antibodies using an AquaMax2000 plate washer (MDS Analytical Technologies). The plate-bound antibodies were "
