    "oteins in the sample can bind. Any free protein binding sites on the dish may then be blocked by incubating with a non-specific protein such as bovine serum albumin. The monoclonal antibody can then be added to the solid support, e.g., the wells or the dish, and allowed to incubate.</p>During the incubation time, the monoclonal antibodies may attach to any B7-related polypeptides or peptides that have attached to the polystyrene dish. All unbound monoclonal antibody can then be washed away using an appropriate buffer solution. The reporter antibody, e.g., linked to horseradish peroxidase, can be added to the support, thereby resulting in the binding of the reporter antibody to any monoclonal antibody that has bound to B7-related polypeptides or peptides that are present in the sample. Unattached reporter antibody can then be washed away. Peroxidase substrate can be added to the support and the amount of color developed in a given time period can be taken to provide a measurement of the amount of B7-related polypeptides or peptides that are present in a given volume of patient sample when compared against a standard curve. For further discussion regarding ELISAs, see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds. (1994) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, at 11.2.1.</p>The binding affinity of an antibody to an antigen and the off-rate of an antibody-antigen interaction can be determined by competitive binding assays. One example of a competitive binding assay is a radioimmunoassay involving the incubation of labeled antigen (e.g., <sup>3</sup>H or <sup>125</sup>I), or a fragment or variant thereof, with the antibody of interest in the presence of increasing amounts of labeled antigen, and the detection of the antibody bound to the labeled antigen. The affinity of the antibody of interest for a B7-related polypeptide of the invention and the binding off rates can be determined from the data by Scatchard plot analysis. Competition with a second antibody can also be determined using radioimmunoassays. In this case, a B7-related polypeptide such as BSL1 (e.g., SEQ ID NO:2), BSL2 (e.g., SEQ ID NO:7, 11, or 13), or BSL3 (e.g., SEQ ID NO:15) is incubated with antibody of interest conjugated to a labeled compound (e.g., a compound labeled with <sup>3</sup>H or <sup>125</sup>I) in the presence of increasing amounts of an unlabeled second antibody. This kind of competitive assay between two antibodies, may also be used to determine if two antibodies bind to the same or different epitopes.</p>In a preferred embodiment, BIACORE\u00ae kinetic analysis is used to determine the binding on and off rates of antibodies (including antibody fragments or variants thereof) to a B7-related polypeptide, or fragments or variants of a B7-related polypeptide disclosed herein. Kinetic analysis comprises analyzing the binding and dissociation of antibodies from chips with immobilized B7-related polypeptide such as BSL1 (e.g., SEQ ID NO:2), BSL2 (e.g.",
    "Such cells can be activated by the addition of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies, phytohemaglutinin (PHA), or phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) with ionomycin. The cDNA library construct can contain a removable epitope tag (see above) that is different from the fusion protein, and will facilitate purification of the library expression product(s) that associate with the fusion protein. The isolated library expression product(s) can then be isolated and characterized.</p>In addition, a fusion protein comprising a B7-related polypeptide can be attached to a solid support (e.g., a column comprising beads that specifically bind to the fusion protein) and incubated with lysates obtained from cells, such as T-cells, that are enriched for integral membrane proteins. The cellular proteins that associate with the fusion protein can be isolated and then characterized using MALDI-TOF analysis (Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time Of Flight Analysis; reviewed by Yates JR 3rd. (1998) J. Mass Spectrom. 33:1-19; P. Chaurand et al. (1999) J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 10:91-103). Fusion proteins can include, for example, FLAG\u00ae\u2014(B. L. Brizzard et al. (1994) Biotechniques 16:730-735), 6\u00d7-HIS, and GST fusion proteins (see above), which can be attached to solid supports that are conjugated with anti-FLAG\u00ae antibodies, nickel, or glutathione molecules, respectively. Methods of producing and purifying such fusion proteins are well known in the art.</p>Another suitable ligand-binding assay is the yeast two-hybrid system (Fields et al. (1989) Nature 340:245-246; U.S. Pat. No. 5,283,173). The two-hybrid system relies on the reconstitution of transcription activation activity by association of the DNA-binding and transcription activation domains of a transcriptional activator through protein-protein interaction. The yeast GAL4 transcriptional activator may be used in this way, although other transcription factors have been used and are well known in the art. To carryout the two-hybrid assay, the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and the GAL4 transcription activation domain are expressed, separately, as fusions to potential interacting polypeptides. For example, one fusion protein can comprise a B7-related polypeptide fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. The other fusion protein can comprise, for example, a T-cell cDNA library encoded polypeptide fused to the GAL4 transcription activation domain. If the two, coexpressed fusion proteins interact in the nucleus of a host cell, a reporter gene (e.g. LacZ) is activated to produce a detectable phenotype. The host cells that show two-hybrid interactions can be used to isolate the containing plasmids containing the cDNA library sequences. These plasmids can be analyzed to determine the nucleic acid sequence and predicted polypeptide sequence of the candidate T-cell ligand.</p>Related, in vivo, methods such as the three-hybrid (Licitra et al. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:12817-12821), and reverse two-hybrid (Vidal et al. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:10315-10320) systems may serve as alternative approaches. Commercially available two-hybrid systems such as the CLONTECH MATCHMAKER\u2122 systems and protocols (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, Calif.) may be also be used. (See also, A. R. Mendelsohn et al. (1994) Curr. Op. Biotech. 5:482; E. M. Phizicky et al. (1995) Microbiological Rev. 59:94; M. Yang et al. (1995) Nucleic Acids Res. 23:1152; S. Fields et al. (1994) Trends Genet. 10:286; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,283,173 and 5,468,614).</p>Ligand sequence(s) obtained from ligand-binding assay(s) can be compared with subject sequences in available databases such as, without limitation, GenPept, SWISS-PROT\u00ae, and Incyte Genomics databases (Incyte Genomics). These databases, which contain previously identified and annotated sequences, may be searched for the full-length polypeptide and gene sequence using, for example, BLAST analysis (see above). In cases where the full-length sequences of the ligands are not available, extended or overlapping partial clones may be obtained by techniques conventionally known and practiced in the art. Non-limiting examples of such techniques include hybridization to plasmid or phage libraries of genomic DNA or cDNA; PCR from the same libraries using B7-related factor primer pairs; or hybridization or PCR directly to genomic DNA or cDNA. These clones may then be sequenced and assembled into full-length genes using the fragment sequence alignment program (PHRAP; Nickerson et al. (1997) Nucleic Acids Res. 25:2745-2751).</p>Assays for B7-related factor activity: Screening the fragments, mutants or variants for those which retain characteristic B7-related polypeptide activity as described herein can be accomplished using one or more of several different assays. For example, appropriate cells, such as CHO cells, can be transfected with the cloned variants and then analyzed for cell surface phenotype by indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Cell surface expression of the transfected cells is evaluated using a monoclona",
    "in Biotech. 14:60), and may be used to produce combinatorial libraries. In another approach, previously identified pharmacological agents can be subjected to directed or random chemical modifications, such as acylation, alkylation, esterification, amidification, and the analogs can be screened for BSL1-, BSL2-, and BSL3-modulating activity.</p>Numerous methods for producing combinatorial libraries are known in the art, including those involving biological libraries; spatially addressable parallel solid phase or solution phase libraries; synthetic library methods requiring deconvolution; the \u2018one-bead one-compound\u2019 library method; and synthetic library methods using affinity chromatography selection. The biological library approach is limited to polypeptide libraries, while the other four approaches are applicable to polypeptide, non-peptide oligomer, or small molecule libraries of compounds (K. S. Lam (1997) Anticancer Drug Des. 12:145).</p>Libraries may be screened in solution (e.g., Houghten, (1992) Biotechniques 13:412-421), or on beads (Lam, (1991) Nature 354:82-84), chips (Fodor, (1993) Nature 364:555-556), bacteria or spores (Ladner U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409), plasmids (Cull et al. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:1865-1869), or on phage (Scott and Smith, (1990) Science 249:386-390; Devlin (1990) Science 249:404-406; Cwirla et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97:6378-6382; Felici (1991) J. Mol. Biol. 222:301-310; Ladner, supra).</p>Where the screening assay is a binding assay, a BSL1, BSL2, or BSL3 polypeptide, fusion protein, polynucleotide, analog, or fragment thereof, may be joined to a label, where the label can directly or indirectly provide a detectable signal. Various labels include radioisotopes, fluorescers, chemiluminescers, enzymes, specific binding molecules, particles, e.g. magnetic particles, and the like. Specific binding molecules include pairs, such as biotin and streptavidin, digoxin and antidigoxin, etc. For the specific binding members, the complementary member would normally be labeled with a molecule that provides for detection, in accordance with known procedures.</p>A variety of other reagents may be included in the screening assay. These include reagents like salts, neutral proteins, e.g. albumin, detergents, etc., that are used to facilitate optimal protein-protein binding and/or reduce non-specific or background interactions. Reagents that improve the efficiency of the assay, such as protease inhibitors, nuclease inhibitors, anti-microbial agents, etc., may be used. The components are added in any order that produces the requisite binding. Incubations are performed at any temperature that facilitates optimal activity, typically between 4\u00b0 and 40\u00b0 C. Incubation periods are selected for optimum activity, but may also be optimized to facilitate rapid high-throughput screening. Normally, between 0.1 and 1 hour will be sufficient. In general, a plurality of assay mixtures is run in parallel with different agent "
