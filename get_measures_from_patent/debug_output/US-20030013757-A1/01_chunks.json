    "sitivity of tumor cells. The assay is based on the cleavage of the yellow tetrazolium salt MTT to purple formazan crystals by metabolic active cells. For details, see Rubinstein, L. V., et al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 82 (1990) 1113-1118. </p>[0275] The following procedure was performed: HT-29 cells (human colon carcinoma cell line) were cultivated in RPMI 1640, 2.5% FCS, 2 mM Glutamine, 100 u/ml Penicillin, 100 ug/ml Streptomycin. For the assay the cells were seeded in 384 well plates, 900 cells per well, in the same medium The next day compounds (dissolved 10 mM in DMSO) were added in various concentrations ranging from 30 uM to 1.5 nM. After 5 days the MTT assay was done mainly according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Cell proliferation kit I, MTT, form Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In brief: MTT labeling reagent was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, added and incubated for 4 hrs at 37 C., 5% CO2. During this incubation time purple formazan crystals are formed. After addition of the solubilization solution (20% SDS in 0.02 M HCl) the plates were incubated overnight at 37 C., 5% CO2. After careful mixing plates were measured in Victor 2 (scanning multiwell spectrophotometer, Wallac) at 550 nm. </p>[0276] A decrease in number of living cells results in a decrease in the total metabolic activity in the sample. The decrease directly correlates to the amount of purple colour resulting from the solubilization of the purple formazan crystals. Determination of IC50 was done using XL-fit. The results of this experiment are provided below in Table 1.  \nTABLE 1Compounds according to this inventionIC50 HT29 [\u03bcM]Example 15, No. 1280.02Example 15, No. 810.03Example 15, No. 1040.04Example 50.05Example 15, No. 930.05Example 15, No. 940.07Example 15, No. 980.07Example 20.11Example 15, No. 900.14Example 15, No. 1390.17\n</p>EXAMPLE 18 [0277]Tablet formulationItemIngredientsmg/Tablet1Compound 2a251002Anhydrous Lactose73353Croscarmellose68Sodium4Povidone K30565Magnesium Stearate11Total Weight110150</p>[0278] Compound 2a is described in Example 2. </p>[0279] Procedure: </p>[0280] 1.
