    "ere dried in air and stored for 24 h at 25\u00b0 C. and relative ambient humidity. Once these strands had been soaked in water for 5 minutes, the wet combability thereof was determined (reference value).</p>For the dyeing operations, 12 strands of natural European hair (IHIP (New York), batch #03/2012, N121, length 15 cm, weight 1 g) were used in each case per oxidative dye. For this purpose, 4 g of the previously produced oxidative lightening agents were applied in each case per 1 g of hair strands. Once the strands had been dyed for 30 minutes at 32\u00b0 C., they were rinsed for 2 minutes with water and dried in air.</p>The wet combability was measured as follows:</p>Before the measurement, each strand was wetted for 2 seconds with water by combing with a hard rubber comb with fine teeth (Hercules S\u00e4gemann, Hamburg Germany). After 3 combing operations, the combing force was measured during a further 10 combing operations, wherein the hair strands were rotated slowly during the combing operation. The measured values obtained were compared with use of the following statistical tests embedded in the software Statistica 10.0 (StatSoft Inc., USA):\nShapiro-Wilks test (test for normal distribution)Grubbs' test for outliersBartlett test (test of homoscedasticity)Univariate significance testNewman-Keuls test (determination of significant differences)Unequal N HSD test (test of multiple comparisons).\n</p>The change in combing force dK in % can be calculated with the aid of the formula dK=[K0\u2212Ki)/K0]*100. Here, K0 is the mean value of the combing force for the un-dyed hair strands, and Ki is the mean value for the hair strands treated with the particular oxidative lighteners.</p>The care of the hair strands is greater, the lower is the applied combing force, and therefore the higher is the change in the combing force. The dK values for the colorings with use of the cosmetic agents V1, E1 and E2 are presented in Table 2. The colorings with the cosmetic agents E1 and E2 according to the invention, which include at least one specific aminated silicone polymer in a total amount of from 0.7% by weight and 1.9% by weight respectively, have a higher change to the combing force and therefore increased care compared to the colorings without aminated silicone polymer (V1).</p>Oxidative dyedK [%]V1 + O1 (1:2)23E1 + O1 (1:2)42E2 + O1 (1:2)40</p>3. Improved Lightening by Addition of at Least One Specific Aminated Silicone Polymer</p>For the lightening process, 4 times the amount of the oxidative lightener produced under point 2. was applied to strands of dark-blond, light-brown and dark-brown hair (Codes: Kerling 6/0, Fischbach &amp; Miller 6923). Once the strands had been bleached for 45 minutes at 32\u00b0 C., they were washed using a commercially available shampoo and dried using a hairdryer.</p>All strands were measured using a color measuring apparatus from Datacolor of the Spectraflash 450 type. The value dL used for the assessment of lightening performance was given as follows from the L*a*b measured color values measured on the respective strands:\n\ndL=Li\u2212L0\n</p>L0 he"
