For the nine amino acids spanning the immunodominant epitope on Peptide 1, the sequence similarity is even higher at 89% and 100% for Streptococcus pyogenes and Porphyromonas gingivalis respectively, as shown below.</p>Table 3: Sequence similarities, presented as percentages, between human \u03b1- enolase and bacterial enolases</p><img id=\"imgf000049_0001\" path=\"imgf000049_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/85906876/WO/20080731/A1/002008/09/03/60/imgf000049_0001.tif\"/></p>Percentage similarities are shown for the whole protein (column2), Peptide 1 (column 3) and the immunodominant epitope (column 4). The Peptide 1 sequence alignment for human and bacterial enolase is shown in column 5. \n\n Generation of anti-Peptide IA antibodies</p>Polyclonal anti-human Peptide IA antibodies were raised in rabbits, and human anti- Peptide IA antibodies were purified from serum from a patient with RA. Specificity <sup>'</sup> for Peptide IA was analysed by ELISA; serial dilutions of the rabbit polyclonal antibody showed a high Peptide lA-specificity, while affinity purified human immunoglobulins also showed reactivity with the arginine-containing control-peptide (Fig 6).</p>Human anti-Peptide IA antibodies cross-react with bacterial enolase</p>Streptococcus pyogenes and Porphyromonas gingivalis lysates were in vitro treated with PAD and blotted with anti-Peptide IA antibodies. A band, which comigrated with purified human enolase at a molecular weight of 50 kD, was visualised in the lysates treated with PAD, but not in the untreated lysates (Fig 16).</p>RA patients have antibodies to P. gingivalis CEP-I and purified anti-CEP-1 antibodies cross-react with bacterial enolase</p>We tested the 102 RA patients from the UK cohort for reactivity with the P. gingivalis version of CEP-I and 34% were found positive (Table 2), with similar IgG antibody levels as observed for the human version of this peptide (data not shown). In addition, serum samples from the US cohort were analysed for anti-P. gingivalis CEP-I -reactivity, and 54% of patients with RA and 2% of healthy controls were positive. This antibody response correlated strongly (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.803, p &lt; 0.0001) with the antibody response directed towards the human version of CEP-I (Figure 14). To investigate whether antibodies, directed to the immunodominant epitope of human \u03b1- enolase, also recognised epitopes in P. gingivalis enolase, bacterial lysates were in vitro treated with PAD, or left untreated, before immunoblotted with affinity purified anti-CEP-1 antibodies. These antibodies were generated in rabbits or purified from rheumatoid sera and their specificity for CEP-I was analysed by ELISA. Serial dilutions of the rabbit polyclonal antibody showed a high CEP-I -specificity (Figure 15A), while affinity purified human immunoglobulins also showed reactivity with the arginine-contaimng control-peptide (Figure 15B).
