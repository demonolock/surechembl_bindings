Pulmonary hypertension in particular relates to pulmonary arterial hypertension, for which the present invention is preferred. Another disorder that can be treated with the described compounds is cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. </p> The vasoconstriction disorder particularly relates to al adrenoceptor mediated disorders, such as pulmonary arterial hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. </p> Another indication which is preferably treated with the compounds of the present invention is heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), in which hypertension generally is co-indicated. </p> In a preferred embodiment, the vasoconstrictive disorder has a co-indication of inflammation. As the chromanol compounds are effective as anti-inflammatory agents, the use of said chromanol compounds is very effective in the prophylaxis or treatment of vasoconstrictive and inflammation related disorders, such as pulmonary hypertension, portal hypertension and </p>(pre)eclampsia. </p> SUL-121 is a 1: 1 racemic mixture of two enantiomers (S enantiomer named SUL-</p>151, R enantiomer named SUL-150). The effects of SUL-150 and SUL-151 on phenylephrine (PE) -induced vascular constrictions were investigated. The results showed that whereas SUL-150 exerted a dose-dependent increase of EC50, whereas no significant effects after treatment with SUL-151 were observed. The SUL-150 was able to inhibit or counteract the induced vascular constrictions. \n\n According to a preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to the (R) enantiomeric form of a 6-chromanol derivative, wherein said prophylaxis or treatment of vasoconstriction related disorders or conditions is mediated by inhibition of the al adrenoceptor, ai adrenoceptors are coupled with the G-protein (GPRC), specifically G<sub>q</sub> and Gn subtypes. Their activation leads to a downstream activation of phospholipase pathways, increase of (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)i and a subsequent constriction of the vascular smooth muscle. Additionally, we have demonstrated the ability of ai adrenoceptors to trans-activate the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) which contributes to downstream phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2. The inhibition of EGFR attenuated constriction responses to PE in isolated rat aortas. Therefore, we investigate the effects of SUL-150 on the mechanism of EGFR transactivation by al </p>adrenoceptors. </p> It was found that the mechanism through which SUL-150 inhibits vasoconstriction is via direct interaction with the ai adrenoceptor as a receptor antagonist. SUL-151 did not affect calcium transients in any of the investigated al adrenoceptor subtypes. Results indicate that SUL- 150 is capable of counteracting vascular constriction and intracellular calcium respon",
    "striction of isolated porcine intrarenal arteries, cumulative dose response curves to the <sub>x</sub> adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine (PE) were constructed in the presence and absence of SUL-150 and SUL-151. The results are presented in Table 1. </p>Table 1: LogECso values of phenylephrine-induced constriction responses in the presence </p> SUL-150 and SUL-151. </p>Phenylephrine </p> SUL-150 SUL-151 </p> Vehicle -5.77+0.04 </p> 10\u03bc\u039c -5.11+0.09* -5.82+0.05 </p> 30\u03bc\u039c -5.06+0.06* -5.89+0.04* </p> \u0399\u039f\u039f\u03bc\u039c -4.44+0.09* -5.77+0.04 </p> # p &lt; 0.05 vs vehicle, * p &lt; 0.0001 vs vehicle \n\n Whereas SUL-150 exerted a dose-dependent increase of EC<sub>50</sub> (Figure 1 A, Table 1), we observed no significant effects after treatment with SUL-151 (Figure IB, Table 1). </p> Additionally, the effects of SUL-150 were investigated on stimulation with methoxamine, which is an alternative ai adrenoceptor agonist. Similar to PE, dose response curves to methoxamine were shifted rightward by SUL-150 pre-treatment (Figure 1C). Removal of the endothelium did not abrogate the effects of SUL-150 on methoxamine induced constriction (Figure ID). </p>Effects of SUL-150 on histamine and U46619 induced vasoconstriction </p> To gain insight into receptor specificity of SUL-150, the effects of SUL-150 on histamine and U46619 (a synthetic thromboxane agonist) induced constrictions were investigated (Figure 2). SUL-150 did not affect constriction responses to histamine (Table 2) and although the shift in EC50 of U46619-induced constrictions in the presence of \u0399\u039f\u039f\u03bc\u039c SUL-150 was statistically significant (Table 2), the small effect size led us to exclude an action of SUL-150 on thromboxane receptors. </p>Table 2: LogECso values of histamine and U46619-induced constriction responses in the presence of SUL-150. </p><img id=\"imgf000013_0001\" path=\"imgf000013_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/484221212/WO/20190228/A1/002019/03/83/61/imgf000013_0001.tif\"/></p> * p &lt; 0.05 versus vehicle </p>Effects of SUL-150 mediated through EGFR transactivation </p> Inhibition of EGF receptor (EGFR) transactivation is known to inhibit ai adrenoceptor mediated constrictions (REF). Therefore, we investigated the role of EGFR transactivation in SUL-150 mediated inhibition of vasoconstriction. For this, porcine intrarenal arteries were pre-treated with the EGFR blocker AG1478 (Figure 3). First, an initial measurement was performed to determine the dose of AG1478 which would cause maximal inhibition of vascular constriction induced by PE (Figure 3A). Subsequently, isolated arteries were treated with AG1478 (20\u03bc\u039c) and SUL- 150 (50\u03bc\u039c) and studied for PE-induced vasoconstriction. Despite maximal inhibition of EGFR transactivation by AG1478, SUL-150 still demonstrated an additional inhibitory effect on PE-mediated constriction (Figure 3B). </p>Effects of SUL-150 on PE-induced intracellular calcium signalling \n\n To further investigate the mechanisms through which SUL-150 inhibits ai adrenoceptor mediated contractions, PE-induced calcium transients were studied in CHO cells stably overexpressing the human ai adrenoceptor subtypes A, B and D. SUL-150 shifted dose response curves rightwards for all three ai adrenoceptor subtypes (Figure 4A, B and C, Table 3). SUL-151 did not affect calcium transients in any of the investigated ai adrenoceptor subtypes (only shown for the ai adrenoceptor A subtype in Figure 4D). </p>Table 3: LogECso values of phenylephrine-induced calcium influx after treatment with SUL-</p>150. </p><img id=\"imgf000014_0001\" path=\"imgf000014_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/484221214/WO/20190228/A1/002019/03/83/61/imgf000014_0001.tif\"/></p> * p &lt; 0.0001 versus vehicle </p>Effects of SUL-150 on histamine- and U46619-induced intracellular calcium signalling </p> To confirm specificity of SUL-150 for the ai adrenoceptor additionally histamine and U46619 induced calcium transients were studied in HeLa cells endogenously expressing human histamine Hi receptor. SUL-150 did not significantly affect histamine and U46619 induced calcium transients (Figures 4E, 4F and Table 2). </p>Radioligand binding assay in O.IA adrenoceptor overexpressing CHO cells </p> SUL-150 affected PE-induced calcium transients, indicating that the effects of</p>SUL-150 are upstream of calcium. We therefore explored whether SUL-150 could directly interact with the ai adrenoceptor as a receptor antagonist. For this, a displacement binding assay was performed on the (Xi<sub>A</sub> adrenoceptor transgenic CHO cells using radiolabeled prazosin, an established (Xi<sub>A</sub> adrenoceptor antagonist. SUL- 150 was more potent in displacing the radioligand compared to SUL-151, which displaced [7-Methoxy-3H]-prazosin only at concentrations higher than 10\u03bc\u039c (Figure 5). </p>Induced fit molecular modelling </p> Prazosin coexists in two protonation forms at pH 7.4. In the protonated form, the Nl assumes a positive charge, subsequently forming a salt bridge with the negatively charged side chain of ASP106, ultimately causing this form to assume an inverted orientation relative to its non- protonated form. The quinazoline scaffold of non-protonated prazosin was docked close to TM5 to form a confocal hydrogen bond between the 6,7-methoxy groups and SER188, a hydrogen bond \n\n between furan oxygen and SER83, and between prazosin carboxamide and GLN177 side chain; van der Waals interactions with side chains of PHE86, VAL107, ILE178, PHE289, MET292, and PHE312; \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions with PHE288 and PHE312; and a \u03c0-hydrogen bond interaction with the side chain carboxy group and backbone peptide carboxamide of ASP106. The proposed binding mode of non-protonated prazosin indicated interactions which were in accord with those described in the literature. </p> An induced fit of SUL-150 and SUL-151 demonstrated alignment of the chromane scaffold with prazosin quinazoline, 6-hydroxy groups (SUL) and 6-metoxy (prazosin) as well as "
