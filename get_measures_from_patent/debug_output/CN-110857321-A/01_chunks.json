    "by serial addition of the nucleic antigen prepared at concentrations of 0.04nM, 0.2nM, 1nM, 5nM and 25 nM.</p>Detailed description of the embodiments</p>The term \"antibody\" in the present specification includes, for example, antibodies, single chain antibodies, heavy chain antibodies, antigen binding portions, and VHH antibodies. The antibodies of the invention may be conjugated or fused to a peptide, oligopeptide or protein.</p>The term \"sequence identity\" in this specification refers to the percentage of identical bases or amino acids at corresponding positions in two or more sequences that are aligned taking into account gaps and insertions, thereby maximizing the degree of sequence identity. Methods for determining identity are designed to give the greatest degree of identity between the aligned sequences. Methods for determining identity between two sequences include, but are not limited to, BLASTP, BLASTN, or FASTA. Alternatively, DNASIS (manufactured by Hitachi Software Engineering co., ltd.) or GENTYYX (manufactured by Genetics co., ltd.) may be used for the identity determination. Alternatively, the short peptide may be determined simply by comparing its sequence. One skilled in the art can determine identity between sequences in the manner described above.</p>In the present disclosure, the binding ability of an antibody to an antigen can be evaluated by methods well known to those skilled in the art. In particular, the evaluation can be performed by determining the dissociation constant Kd by a method using an antigen and a surface plasmon resonance evaluation apparatus (i.e., SPR method). In addition, for example, the evaluation can be performed by a method using an ELISA method in which an antigen is immobilized.</p>The present invention relates to antibodies capable of binding norovirus.
