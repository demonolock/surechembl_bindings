CD137 Direct Binding Assay </p> Affinity of the peptides of the invention for human CD137 (Ki) was determined using a fluorescence polarisation assay, in accordance with the methods disclosed in WO 2016/067035. Peptides of the invention were labelled with a fluorescent tag (fluorescein, Fl) and diluted to 2.5nM in 50mM HEPES with 100mM NaCI and 0.05% tween pH 7.5. CD137 protein was titrated starting at 3\u03bc\u039c in the same assay buffer as the peptide to assay 1 nM peptide in a total volume of 25\u03bc\u03af in black walled and bottomed low bind low volume 384 well plates. The assay was typically set up by adding 5\u03bc\u03af assay buffer, 10\u03bc\u03af CD137 protein then ^ 0 ^L fluorescent peptide. The concentrations of CD137 protein were 1 in 2 serial dilutions to \n\n give 12 different concentrations starting at 3\u03bc\u039c. Measurements were conducted on a BMG PHERAstar FS equipped with an FP 485 520 520 optic module at 25\u00b0C with 200 flashes per well and a positioning delay of 0.1 second. Alternatively, the measurements were performed using Envision (PerkinElmer) equipped with FITC FP Dual Enh mirror, set to 30 flashes. Each well was measured every 5 minutes for 60 minutes. The gain used for analysis was determined for each tracer at the end of the 60 minutes where there was no protein in the well. The mP were fit to a standard 1 :1 binding model with a quadratic equation to generate a Kd value. Selected peptides of the invention were tested in the above mentioned assay and the results are shown in Tables 1 to 3: \n\n</p>Table 1 : Direct Binding Results with Selected Peptides </p><img id=\"imgf000040_0001\" path=\"imgf000040_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/476759216/WO/20190207/A1/002019/02/58/11/imgf000040_0001.tif\"/></p><img id=\"imgf000041_0001\" path=\"imgf000041_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/476759218/WO/20190207/A1/002019/02/58/11/imgf000041_0001.tif\"/></p><img id=\"imgf000042_0001\" path=\"imgf000042_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/476759217/WO/20190207/A1/002019/02/58/11/imgf000042_0001.tif\"/></p> Table 2: Alanine Scan Results\n<img id=\"imgf000042_0002\" path=\"imgf000042_0002.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/476759211/WO/20190207/A1/002019/02/58/11/imgf000042_0002.tif\"/>\n \n\n</p><img id=\"imgf000043_0001\" path=\"imgf000043_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/476759212/WO/20190207/A1/002019/02/58/11/imgf000043_0001.tif\"/></p> Table 3: Direct Binding Results with Selected Peptides\n<img id=\"imgf000043_0002\" path=\"imgf000043_0002.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/476759221/WO/20190207/A1/002019/02/58/11/imgf000043_0002.tif\"/>\n \n\n</p><img id=\"imgf000044_0001\" path=\"imgf000044_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/476759213/WO/20190207/A1/002019/02/58/11/imgf000044_0001.tif\"/></p><img id=\"imgf000045_0001\" path=\"imgf000045_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/476759208/WO/20190207/A1/002019/02/58/11/imgf000045_0001.tif\"/></p><img id=\"imgf000046_0001\" path=\"imgf000046_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/476759215/WO/20190207/A1/002019/02/58/11/imgf000046_0001.tif\"/></p><img id=\"imgf000047_0001\" path=\"imgf000047_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/476759210/WO/20190207/A1/002019/02/58/11/imgf000047_0001.tif\"/></p>2. CD137 Biacore Experiments </p>(a) Amine coupled CD137 target assay description </p> Biacore experiments were performed to determine k<sub>a</sub> (M<sup>\"1</sup>s<sup>_1</sup>), kd (s<sup>_1</sup>), KD (nM) values of peptides binding to human CD137 (AcroBiosystems) protein. CD137 protein was diluted and immobilised using the standard amine coupling procedure to chip CM5 (#BR-1005-30). CD137 protein was diluted to 10 ug/ml in NaAc pH 5.5 and used for coupling. Ethanolamine is then injected to deactivate remaining active esters. The CD137 protein was immobilise at 180 RUs of CD137 protein to generate the maximum theoretical binding response with a peptide of 2500 MW will be -25 RUs. A blank immobilisation of the reference flow cell (Fc1 or Fc3) is performed when amine coupling, following exactly the same procedure but with no injection of protein target. The peptides were tested at starting concentrations of 300-450 nM and diluted in \u00bd dilutions series. The DMSO concentration was adjusted to remain constant. </p>The peptide binding kinetic analysis was performed as follows at flow rate 50 \u03bc\u0399/min, 200 sec association, 600 sec dissociation and 60 sec stabilization. The Bicyclic peptides were fitted using the 1 : 1 model Biacore T200 Evaluation software. </p>Selected peptides of the invention were tested in the above mentioned assay and the results are shown in Table 4: \n\n</p>Table 4: SPR Data for Selected Peptides of the Invention </p><img id=\"imgf000049_0001\" path=\"imgf000049_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/476759207/WO/20190207/A1/002019/02/58/11/imgf000049_0001.tif\"/></p>(b) Biotinylated CD137 target assay description </p> Biacore experiments were performed to determine k<sub>a</sub> (M<sup>\"1</sup>s<sup>_1</sup>), kd (s<sup>_1</sup>), KD (nM) values of peptides binding to human CD137 protein. Recombinant human CD137 homotrimer (R&amp;D systems) was resuspended in PBS and biotinylated using EZ-Link\u2122 Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-Biotin reagent (Thermo Fisher) as per the manufacturer's suggested protocol. The protein was desalted to remove uncoupled biotin using spin columns into PBS. </p>For analysis of binding, a Biacore T200 instrument was used utilising a XanTec CMD500D chip. Streptavidin was immobilized on the chip using standard amine-coupling chemistry at 25\u00b0C with HBS-N (10 mM HEPES, 0.15 M NaCI, pH 7.4) as the running buffer. Briefly, the carboxymethyl dextran surface was activated with a 7 min injection of a 1 :1 ratio of 0.4 M 1- ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC)/0.1 M /V-hydroxy succinimide (NHS) at a flow rate of 10 \u03bc\u0399/min. For capture of streptavidin, the protein was diluted to 0.2 mg/ml in 10 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.5) and captured by injecting 120\u03bc\u0399 of onto the activated chip surface. Residual activated groups were blocked with a 7 min injection of 1 M ethanolamine (pH 8.5) and biotinylated CD137 captured to a level of 800-1800 RU. Buffer was changed to PBS/0.05% Tween 20 and a dilution series of the peptides was prepared in this buffer with a final DMSO concentration of 0.5%. The top peptide concentration was 500nM or 10\u03bc\u039c with 6 further 3-fold (500nm), or 2-fold (10\u03bc\u039c) dilutions in PBS/0.05% Tween 20. The SPR analysis was run at 25\u00b0C at a flow rate of 90\u03bc\u0399/\u0393\u03b7\u03ca\u03b7 with 60 seco",
    "xperiments were performed by preparing medium by thawing FBS and adding 1 % FBS to RPMI-1640 (Promega kit CS196005). Dilute agonists at concentration giving agonism CD137L (R&amp;D systems 2295-4L/CF) diluted to 100 nM in the RPMI-1640 medium as final concentration in the assay. Dilute and then titrate down the bicyclic peptide in a sterile 96 well-plate. Suggested starting concentration for the bicyclic peptide is 10 \u03bc\u039c, 100-fold excess over the agonist CD137L. Prepare enough reagent for duplicate samples and then perform 1/3 dilution series dilution series. Include positive control CD137L and bicyclic peptide alone. Thaw CD137 Jurkat cells in the water-bath and then add 500 \u03bc\u0399 cells to 9.5 ml pre-warmed 1 % FBS RPMI-1640 medium. Add 50 \u03bc\u0399 cells/well to white cell culture plate. Add 12.5 \u03bc\u0399 bicyclic peptide (at 6x final concentration) to the cells. Then add 12.5 \u03bc\u0399 of agonist (at 6x final concentration) as duplicate samples or 1 % FBS RPMI-1640 alone as background control. </p>Co-incubate cells together with CD137L agonist and bicyclic peptide for 6h at 37\u00b0C, 5 % CO2. After 6h thaw Bio-Glo\u2122 and develop the assay at room-temperature. Add 75\u03bc\u0399 Bio-Glo\u2122 per well and incubate 5-10 min. Read luminescence signal on Pherastar plate-reader LUM plus models, gain 3600 using MARS software. Analyse data by calculating the percentage inhibition compared to CD137L alone. Transform the data to x=log (X), then plot log (inhibitor) vs. response variable slope (4 parameters) to calculate the IC50 value. </p>The Promega CD137 cell-reporter assay (product number CS196008) was used to determine the antagonistic effect of the peptide BCY592 (74-01 -04- N 002; SEQ ID NO: 189) in inhibiting the natural ligand CD137L induction. The CD137 assay cells were co-incubated with trimeric CD137L (R&amp;D systems) + BCY592 peptide. The CD137 reporter activity was determined as NF-\u03ba\u0392 promotor driven luciferase activity. The effect of the peptide BCY592 was plotted as % inhibition relative to baseline CD137L activity in the assay and used to determine the IC50-value. \n\n The results are shown in Figure 1 where it can be seen that the bicyclic peptide BCY592 specific for CD137 can act as an antagonist that inhibits CD137L activity. This result indicates that this peptide can be used in settings where it is desirable to block CD137 biological activity. It is known that CD137 activity can cause liver injury due to inflammation driven by the local immune cells. It is therefore believed that the bicyclic peptide BCY592 (and by inference other bicyclic CD137 peptides of the invention) may reduce CD137\u2014 CD137L driven inflammation which would reduce hepatotoxicity of CD137 agonists. </p>4. Fluorescence Polarization Competition Binding Assay </p>The binding site of the hCD137-specific Bicycle peptide was determined by competition experiment between a fluorescent labelled CD137 binding peptide and natural ligand CD137L, agonistic antibodies Urelumab and Utomilumab. Urelumab antibody binds to a distinct binding site while CD137L and Utomilumab both bind to the site termed the ligand-binding site. The competitor agonists CD137L (R&amp;D systems), Urelumab and Utomilumab were diluted in assay buffer 20mM HEPES, 150mM NaCI, 0.05% P20, pH7.5 to a top concentration of 500- 1000 nM. The human CD137 protein (AcroBiosystems) was diluted to 500 nM final concentration in the assay. Finally, the fluorescent tracer peptide BCY640 (74-01 -04-N001) was added at 1 nM. The assay was typically set up by adding 5\u03bc\u0399_ agonist competitor, 10\u03bc\u0399_ CD137 protein then 10\u03bc\u0399_ fluorescent peptide. The total volume of 25\u03bc\u0399_ was prepared in black walled and bottomed low binding low volume 384 well plates. Measurements were conducted on a BMG PHERAstar FS equipped with an FP 485 520 520 optic module at 25\u00b0C with 200 flashes per well and a positioning delay of 0.1 second. Each well was measured every 5 minutes for 60 minutes. The gain was set in a well containing tracer without target protein. The mP-values at the end of the 60 minutes read were plotted against concentration of the agonists. Reduction in the mP-values indicates competition between the known agonist and the tracer peptide. </p>The results are shown in Figures 2 and 3 "
