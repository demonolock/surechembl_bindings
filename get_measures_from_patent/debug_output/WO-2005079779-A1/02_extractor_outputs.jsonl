{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that contain all four required components: a specific molecule name, ID or other identifier, a bioactivity metric, a specific numeric value for that metric, and a unit for that value. The text appears to be descriptive of methods, proteins, and their characteristics, but does not include specific bioactivity metrics with numeric values and units."}
{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that meet the specified criteria, as none of the sentences contain a specific molecule name, a bioactivity metric, a numeric value, and a unit. The text primarily discusses the genetic and molecular basis of Alzheimer's disease, but does not provide specific bioactivity data."}
