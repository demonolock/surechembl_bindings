    "rm that the various DNA sequences have been joined correctly to one another. The inserts of positive clones are subjected to sequence analysis. Larger scale plasmid DNA is isolated using a commercially available kit (QIAGEN Plasmid Maxi Kit, Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.) according to manufacturer's instructions. The correct construct is designated zvegf4/pZMP6.</p>EXAMPLE 2Recombinant zvegf4 having a carboxyl-terminal Glu-Glu affinity tag was produced in a baculovirus expression system according to conventional methods. The culture was harvested, and the cells were lysed with a solution of 0.02 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM 4-(2-Aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (PEFABLOC\u00ae SC; Boehringer-Mannheim), 0.5 \u03bcM aprotinin, 4 mM leupeptin, 4 mM E-64, 1% NP-40 at 4\u00b0 C. for 15 minutes on a rotator. The solution was centrifuged, and the supernatant was recovered. Twenty ml of extract was combined with 50 \u03bcl of anti-Glu-Glu antibody conjugated to cross-linked agarose (SEPHAROSE\u2122) beads in 50 \u03bcl buffer. The mixture was incubated on a rotator at 4\u00b0 C. overnight. The beads were recovered by centrifugation and washed 3\u00d715 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. Pellets were combined with sample buffer containing reducing agent and heated at 98\u00b0 C. for five minutes. The protein was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions followed by western blotting on a PVDF membrane using an antibody to the affinity tag. Two bands were detected, one a M<sub>1</sub>\u02dc49 kD and the other at M<sub>1</sub>\u02dc21 kD. Sequence analysis showed the larger band to comprise two sequences, one beginning at Arg-19 of SEQ ID NO:2 and the other beginning at Asn-35 of SEQ ID NO:2. The asparagine residue appeared to have been deamidated to an aspartic acid. The smaller band began at Ser-250 of SEQ ID NO:2.</p>EXAMPLE 3Recombinant carboxyl-terminal Glu-Glu tagged zvegf4 (zvegf4-cee) was produced from recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cells. Two-liter cultures were harvested, and the media were sterile-filtered using a 0.2 \u03bcm filter.</p>Protein was purified from the conditioned media by a combination of anti-Glu-Glu (anti-EE) peptide antibody affinity chromatography and S-200 gel exclusion chromatography. Culture media (pH 6.0, conductivity 7 mS) was directly loaded onto a 20\u00d780 mm (25-ml bed volume) anti-EE antibody affinity column at a flow of 6 ml/minute. The column was washed with ten column volumes of PBS, then bound protein was eluted with two column volumes of 0.4 mg/ml EYMPTD peptide (SEQ ID NO:6) (Princeton BioMolecules Corp., Langhorne, Pa.). Five-ml fractions were collected. Samples from the anti-EE antibody affinity column were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with silver staining and western blotting (as disclosed below) for the presence of zvegf4-cee. Zvefg4-cee-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated to 3.8 ml by filtration using a BIOMAX\u2122-5 concentrator (Millipore Corp., Bedford, Mass.), and loaded onto a 16\u00d71000 mm gel filtration column (SEPHACRYL\u2122 S-200 HR; Amersham Pharmacia",

Protein produced in the HaCaT human keratinocyte cell line was electrophoresed under reducing and non-reducing conditions, transferred to filters, and probed with antibodies to the interdomain and CUB domain regions of the protein. Reduced protein appeared as a single band having an apparent M<sub>r </sub>of approximately 53 kD, consistent with a glycosylated, monomeric protein. Non-reduced protein appeared as a single band having an apparent M<sub>r </sub>of approximately 85 kD, consistent with a disulfide-linked dimer.</p>EXAMPLE 10Hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC; dry powder) is reconstituted in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0 containing 0.2% (w/v) methyl paraben to give a concentration of 1.5% HEC (w/v). The mixture is sterilized by autoclaving at 120\u00b0 for 20 minutes. Zvegf4 protein is added to a final concentration of 250 \u03bcg per gram of gel.</p>EXAMPLE 11A 2.5% (w/v) hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) gel is prepared by dissolving powdered HPMC in 100 mM citrate buffer, pH 6.0 containing 0.1% (w/v) methyl paraben.

Zvegf4 protein is added to a final concentration of 500 \u03bcg per gram of gel.</p>EXAMPLE 12Zvegf4 is used to regenerate bone and ligament lost to periodontal disease. Teeth showing 20% to 80% reduction of surrounding jaw bone are scaled, then a full-thickness gingival flap is made by an incision to expose the jaw bone and tooth root. The root is planed to remove bacterial plaque and calculus. Zvegf4 is applied to the periodontal pocket in a 2.5% HPMC gel at a dose of 100 \u03bcg per tooth. The gingival flap is then closed and held in place by suturing.</p>EXAMPLE 13For regeneration of bone lost to periodontal disease, affected teeth are scaled, and a full-thickness gingival flap is made by incision, exposing the jaw bone and tooth root.
