The IC50 values in the CDK8/19 NFkB assay are very strongly correlated with ALPase EC200 values (Fig. 2B), indicating that the ALPase effect is most likely mediated through CDK8/19 inhibition, with EC200 values expressed as a concentration that enhances ALPase activity to 200% of control.\n3. Table 2 shows the kinome profile of 15u_D6 and 15u as measured via the KINOMEscan site-directed competition binding assay at 2000 nM concentration.\n4. The compounds were screened at a 10 nM concentration, and results for primary screen binding interactions are reported as “% Ctrl” or “POC”, where lower numbers indicate stronger hits in the matrix.\n5. Dissociation constants (Kds) for test compound-kinase interactions are calculated by measuring the amount of kinase captured on the solid support as a function of the test compound concentration."
