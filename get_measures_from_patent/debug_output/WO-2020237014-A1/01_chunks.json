Thienopyridine derivatives inhibit CDK8/19 activity in a cell-based assay. </p> Figure 1 shows the structures of six thienopyridine derivatives of (Saito, 2013) that were synthesized and tested. \n\n We have used a cell-based assay to measure the inhibition of CDK8/19 activity by thienopyridine derivatives. This assay, based on the role of CDK8/19 in NFKB-driven transcription (Chen, 2017), measures the effects of CDK8/19 on the expression of firefly luciferase reporter from a NFrcB-dependent promoter in 293 cells. Lentiviral vector pHAGE-NFKB-TA-LUC-UBC- dTomato-W (Addgene #49335) was introduced into 293 cells and a clonal cell line showing the strongest induction of luciferase expression upon TNFa treatment was established and used as the reporter cell line. As a control for CDK8/19 dependence of NFKB inhibition, we have also introduced the same reporter construct into 293 cells with CRISPR/CAS9 knockout of both CDK8 and CDK19. </p> Figs. 2A and 2B show the effects of different concentrations of 15u and 15w on NFKB reporter activity in parental 293 and in CDK8/19 deficient (double-knockout) reporter cells. While these compounds inhibited the reporter induction at IC50 values of 10 and 4 nM, respectively, they had no effect on NFKB activation in CDK8/19-deficient cells, demonstrating that the inhibitory effects of both compounds depend on the presence of CDK8/19 and not on other determinants of NFKB activity, such as IKK. </p> Fig. 2C and Table 1 compares the IC50 values for different thienopyridines measured in the NFKB reporter assay in parental 293 -derived reporter cell line to the cell-based activity values measured for the same compounds by Saito (2013) based on their effect on alkaline phosphatase (ALPase), an indicator of differentiation to osteoblasts in the mouse bone marrow stromal cell line ST2. The latter effects are expressed as EC 200, a concentration that enhances ALPase activity to 200% of control. The IC50 values in the CDK8/19 NFkB assay are very strongly correlated with ALPase EC200 values (Fig. 2B), indicating that the ALPase effect is most likely mediated through CDK8/19 inhibition. </p>Table 1: Comparison of ALP and NFKB activity </p><img id=\"imgf000022_0001\" path=\"imgf000022_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/790734019/WO/20201126/A1/002020/23/70/14/imgf000022_0001.tif\"/><img id=\"imgf000023_0001\" path=\"imgf000023_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/790734055/WO/20201126/A1/002020/23/70/14/imgf000023_0001.tif\"/></p>Example 2. Kinome profiling of thienopyridine derivatives. </p> Table 2 shows the kinome profile of 15u_D6 and 15u as measured via the KINOMEscan\u2122 site-directed competition binding assay at 2000 nM concentration. Compounds that bind the kinase active site and directly (sterically) or indirectly (allosterically) prevent kinase binding to the immobilized ligand, will reduce the amount of kinase captured on the solid support. Conversely, test molecules that do not bind the kinase have no effect on the amount of kinase captured on the solid support. Screening \"hits\" are identified by measuring the amount of kinase captured in test versus control samples by using a quantitative, precise and ultra-sensitive qPCR method that detects the associated DNA label. In a similar manner, dissociation constants (Kds) for test compound-kinase interactions are calculated by measuring the amount of kinase captured on the solid support as a function of the test compound concentration. A detailed description of the assay technology may be found in Fabian, M.A. et al. A small molecule-kinase interaction map for clinical kinase inhibitors. Nat. Biotechnol. 23, 329-336 (2005). </p> Percent Control (%Ctrl). The compounds were screened at a 10 nM concentration, and results for primary screen binding interactions are reported as\u201c% Ctrl\u201d or\u201cPOC\u201d, where lower numbers indicate stronger hits in the matrix. %Ctrl is defined as (eqn 1): </p>%Ctrl = 100 x (TS - CPOS) / (CNEG - CPOS) (eqn 1) where TS is the test compound signal, CPOS is the positive control signal (0 %Ctrl), CNEG is the DMSO negative control (100 %Ctrl). </p> Results.

The Kd assays were carried out in duplicates and the results are presented in Table 3. This table also shows the results of Kd determination for 15w versus CDK8, CDK19 and RIOK2. </p>Table 3.

The principal other kinases inhibited by 15u with Kd values less than 4 times higher than for CDK8 are RIOK2 (also strongly inhibited by 15w), CSNK1A1 and CSNKIE (not tested for 15w). </p> Remarkably, the reported evidence suggests that the inhibition of these three kinases may be beneficial rather than detrimental for cancer treatment. Thus RIOK2, an atypical kinase regulating ribosomal biogenesis was identified as the target of a compound that selectively inhibited growth of prostate cancer cell lines carrying an oncogenic gene fusion that activates ERG gene in many prostate cancers. The same RIOK2 -binding compound had only minimal effect on normal prostate or endothelial cells or ERG-negative tumor cell lines (Mohamed, AA etal ., Cancer Res. 2018 Jul 1;78(13):3659-3671. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-2949). CSNK1A1 has been implicated as an oncogenic factor in a variety of leukemias and solid tumors (Mannis, S. et al. J Hematol Oncol. 2017 Oct 2; 10(1): 157. doi: 10.1186/sl3045-017-0529-5; Richter, J. et al. , BMC Cancer. 2018 Feb 6; 18(1): 140. doi: 10.1186/sl2885-018-4019-0) and CSNK1A1 inhibitors synergized with lysosomotropic agents to inhibit growth and promote tumor cell death in KRAS- driven cancers (Cheong, J.K. et al ., J Clin Invest. 2015 Apr; 125(4): 1401-18. doi: 10.1172/JCI78018). CSNKIE inhibition was reported to have selective antiproliferative activity in several types of tumor cells (Yang, WS, et al, Genome Biol. 2008;9(6):R92. doi: 10.1186/gb- 2008-9-6-r92; Kim, S.Y. et al, PLoS One. 2010 Feb l;5(2):e897",
    "th vehicle (5% dextrose) or 15u (25 mg/kg, in 5% carboxylmethyl cellulose, oral, b.i.d.). 15u significantly increased mouse survival of the metastatic disease (Fig. 10E), with the effect similar to that of the CDK8 knockdown (Fig. IOC). </p> In another study with this model, tumors formed by parental 4T1 cells were removed and mice were randomized into two groups (Fig. 10F, n=8), treated with Senexin B (administered in medicated food (350 ppm) in combination with one oral dose 50 mg/kg as described in (Liang, 2018)) or receiving control food and vehicle. Senexin B treatment provided a statistically significant but moderate increase in survival (Fig. 10G), weaker than the effect of 15u. \n\n Example 7. Anti-leukemic effects of thienopyridine derivatives </p> The anti-leukemic properties of 15u were investigated in an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line MV4-11, previously shown to be sensitive to CDK8/19 inhibition in vitro and in vivo (Pelish HE, et al., 2015. Nature 526(7572):273-276). The population of MV4-11 cells used for in vivo studies was made to express Luciferase and ZsGreen by lenviral infection with pHIV- Luc-ZsGreen, to enable leukemia growth analysis by bioluminescence imaging (BLI). The initial Luciferase-ZsGreen transduced cell population was sorted for ZsGreen positivity with fluorescence activated cell sorting. This MV4-11 cell population was tested for sensitivity to 15u. 15u strongly inhibited MV4-11 proliferation, and was deemed anti-proliferative with an IC50 value of 25 nM (Figure 11 A). </p> For in vivo studies, 7-week-old female NSG mice (Jackson Laboratories) were injected with 2 x 10<sup>6</sup> luciferase-expressing MV4-11 cells in the tail vein. Following engraftment, BLI was performed on the inoculated mice 5 days after cell inoculation. After BLI, the mice were sorted into two matching cohorts of 10 mice and one cohort of 5 mice. BLI detection was done with IVIS Lumina II Series Hardware for In-Vivo Imaging with optional XFOV lens and Living Image software. The IVIS setting for sorting mice into cohorts was set for high sensitivity: Bin 8, FI .2, 180 sec. Subsequent exposures (week 1-5) were set for increased resolution: Bin 4, FI .2, 120 sec. </p> Treatment was initiated on day 6 following cell-inoculation and continued for 23 days. Ten mice received Vehicle only (5% carboxylmethyl cellulose) by gavage (200 m\u0390). Ten mice received 30 mg/kg 15u suspended in the Vehicle twice daily by gavage (200 m\u0390). 5 mice were treated with medicated food (chow) containing 15u at 1 g/kg in a custom Teklad diet prepared by Envigo (Madison, WI). This diet matches the diet used for normal mouse feeding, with the exception of added dye and 15u. The control MV4-11 xenografted mice (Vehicle) developed a vigorous tumor population as detected by BLI (Figure 11B-11C). The 15u gavage treatment group shows a remarkable response with a 94% growth inhibition of leukemia growth, p=0.001. The 15u chow treatment group shows an even more remarkable l"
