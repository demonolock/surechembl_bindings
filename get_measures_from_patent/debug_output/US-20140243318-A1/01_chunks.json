    "pically water or an organic solvent.</p>The term \u201cunder vacuum\u201d refers to typical pressures obtainable by a laboratory oil or oil-free diaphragm vacuum pump.</p>The term \u201cpharmaceutical composition\u201d refers to a composition comprising one or more of the polymorphic forms of salts of Compound 1 described herein, and other chemical components, such as physiologically/pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, vehicles and/or excipients. The purpose of a pharmaceutical composition is to facilitate administration of a compound to an organism, such as a human or other mammal.</p>The term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d \u201ccarrier\u201d, \u201cdiluent\u201d, \u201cvehicle\u201d, or \u201cexcipient\u201d refers to a material (or materials) that may be included with a particular pharmaceutical agent to form a pharmaceutical composition, and may be solid or liquid. Exemplary solid carriers are lactose, sucrose, talc, gelatin, agar, pectin, acacia, magnesium stearate, stearic acid and the like. Exemplary liquid carriers are syrup, peanut oil, olive oil, water and the like. Similarly, the carrier or diluent may include time-delay or time-release material known in the art, such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax, ethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, methylmethacrylate and the like.</p>The term \u201cmediated by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activity\u201d refers to biological or molecular processes that are regulated, modulated, or inhibited by PARP activity. For certain applications, inhibition of PARP activity associated with cancer is preferred. Embodiments disclosed herein include methods of modulating or inhibiting PARP activity, for example in mammals, by administering polymorphic salt forms of Compound 1, or a solid form that comprises two or more polymorphic salt forms of Compound 1. The activity or efficacy of polymorphic salt forms of Compound 1, or a solid form that comprises two or more such forms, may be measured as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,495,541 and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2006-0074073, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</p>The term \u201ctreating\u201d, as used herein, unless otherwise indicated, means reversing, alleviating, inhibiting the progress of, or preventing the disorder or condition to which such term applies, or one or more symptoms of such disorder or condition. The term \u201ctreatment\u201d, as used herein, unless otherwise indicated, refers to the act of \u201ctreating\u201d as defined immediately above. For example, the terms \u201ctreat\u201d, \u201ctreating\u201d and \u201ctreatment\u201d can refer to a method of alleviating or abrogating a hyperproliferative disorder (e.g., cancer) and/or one or more of its attendant symptoms. With regard particularly to cancer, these terms can indicate that the life expectancy of an individual affected with a cancer will be increased or that one or more of the symptoms of the disease will be reduced.</p>An \u201ceffective amount\u201d refers to the amount of an agent that si"
