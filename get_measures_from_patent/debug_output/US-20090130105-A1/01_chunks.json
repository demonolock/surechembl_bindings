    "nds to an epitope other than the one that induced its formation. The cross reactive epitope generally contains many of the same complementary structural features as the inducing epitope, and in some cases, may actually fit better than the original.</p>For example, certain binding molecules have some degree of cross-reactivity, in that they bind related, but non-identical epitopes, e.g., epitopes with at least 95%, at least 90%, at least 85%, at least 80%, at least 75%, at least 70%, at least 65%, at least 60%, at least 55%, and at least 50% identity (as calculated using methods known in the art and described herein) to a reference epitope. An antibody may be said to have little or no cross-reactivity if it does not bind epitopes with less than 95%, less than 90%, less than 85%, less than 80%, less than 75%, less than 70%, less than 65%, less than 60%, less than 55%, and less than 50% identity (as calculated using methods known in the art and described herein) to a reference epitope. An antibody may be deemed \u201chighly specific\u201d for a certain antigen or epitope, if it does not bind any other analog, ortholog, or homolog of that antigen or epitope.</p>As used herein, the term \u201caffinity\u201d refers to a measure of the strength of the binding of an individual epitope with the binding site of a binding molecule. See, e.g., Harlow et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2nd ed. 1988) at pages 27-28.

See, e.g, Harlow at pages 29-34. Avidity is related to both the affinity of individual binding molecules in the population with specific epitopes, and also the valencies of the binding molecules and the antigen. For example, the interaction between a bivalent monoclonal antibody and an antigen with a highly repeating epitope structure, such as a polymer, would be one of high avidity.</p>In certain embodiments, the binding site of a binding molecule of the invention is an antigen binding site. An antigen binding site is formed by variable regions that vary from one polypeptide to another. In one embodiment, the polypeptides of the invention comprise at l",

In a cancer cell, in addition to pro-survival and proliferative signaling, activation of IGF-1R has also been shown to be involved in motility and invasion (Ress et al., Oncogene 2001. 20:490-00, Nolan et al, Int. J. Cancer. 1997.72:828-34, Stracke et al, J. Biol. Chem. 1989. 264:21544-49; Jackson et al, Oncogene, 2001. 20:7318-25).</p>IGF-1R is expressed in a large number of tumor cells, including, but not limited to certain of the following: bladder tumors (Hum. Pathol. 34:803 (2003)); brain tumors (Clinical Cancer Res. 8:1822 (2002)); breast tumors (Eur. J. Cancer 30:307 (1994) and Hum Pathol. 36:448-449 (2005)); colon tumors, e.g., adenocarcinomas, metastases, and adenomas (Human Pathol. 30:1128 (1999), Virchows. Arc. 443:139 (2003), and Clinical Cancer Res. 10:843 (2004)); gastric tumors (Clin. Exp. Metastasis 21:755 (2004)); kidney tumors, e.g., clear cell, chromophobe and papillary RCC (Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 122:931-937 (2004)); lung tumors (Hum. Pathol. 34:803-808 (2003) and J. Cancer Res. Clinical Oncol. 119:665-668 (1993)); ovarian tumors (Hum. Pathol. 34:803-808 (2003)); pancreatic tumors, e.g., ductal adenocarcinoma (Digestive Diseases. Sci. 48:1972-1978 (2003) and Clinical Cancer Res. 11:3233-3242 (2005)); and prostate tumors (Cancer Res. 62:2942-2950 (2002)).</p>The molecular architecture of IGF-1R comprises, two extra-cellular \u03b1 subunits (130-135 kD each) and two membrane spanning \u03b2 subunits (95 kD each) that contain the cytoplasmic catalytic kinase domain. IGF-1R, like the insulin receptor (InsR), differs from other RTK family members by having covalent dimeric (\u03b12\u03b22) structures linked by disulfide bonds (Massagu\u00e9, J. and Czech, M. P. J. Biol. Chem. 257:5038-5045 (1992)). The IGF-1R extracellular region consists of 6 protein domains which linked in series as follows: an N-terminal Leucine Rich Repeat Domain (L1); a Cysteine Rich Repeat (CRR); a second Leucine Rich Repeat domain (L2); and three Fibronectin Type III domains, denoted FnIII-1, FnIII-2, and FnIII-3 (see FIG. 1).</p>The nucleic acid sequence of the human IGF-1R mRNA is available under GenBank Accession Number NM<sub>\u2014</sub>000875 (gi|1119220593). The precursor polypeptide sequence is available under GenBank Accession Number NP<sub>\u2014</sub>000866 (gi 4557665). Amino acids 1 to 30 reported to encode the IGF-1R signal peptide, amino acids 31 to 740 are reported to encode the IGF-1R \u03b1-subunit, and amino acids 741 to 1367 are reported to encode the IGF-1R \u03b2-subunit. The mature IGF-1R polypeptide lacks the IGF1-R signal peptide. Therefore, numbering of IGF-1R amino acids in the instant application refers to the amino acid sequence of the mature form of human IGF-1R as shown in FIG. 2 (SEQ ID NO:2).

In ELISAs the binding molecule of interest does not have to be conjugated to a detectable compound; instead, a second binding molecule (which recognizes the binding molecule of interest) conjugated to a detectable compound may be added to the well. Further, instead of coating the well with the antigen, the binding molecule may be coated to the well. In this case, a second binding molecule conjugated to a detectable compound may be added following the addition of the antigen of interest to the coated well. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected as well as other variations of ELISAs known in the art. For further discussion regarding ELISAs see, e.g., Ausubel et al., eds, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, Vol. 1 (1994) at 11.2.1.</p>The binding affinity of binding molecule to an antigen and the off-rate of a binding molecule-antigen interaction can be determined by competitive binding assays. One example of a competitive binding assay is a radioimmunoassay comprising the incubation of labeled antigen (e.g., <sup>3</sup>H or <sup>125</sup>I) with the binding molecule of interest in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled antigen, and the detection of the binding molecule bound to the labeled antigen. The affinity of the binding molecule of interest for a particular antigen and the binding off-rates can be determined from the data by Scatchard plot analysis. Competition with a second binding molecule can also be determined using radioimmunoassays. In this case, the antigen is incubated with antibody of interest is conjugated to a labeled compound (e.g., <sup>3</sup>H or <sup>125</sup>I) in the presence of increasing amounts of an unlabeled second binding molecule.</p>IGF-1R-specific binding molecules may, additionally, be employed histologically, as in immunofluorescence, immunoelectron microscopy or non-immunological assays, for in situ detection of cancer antigen gene products or conserved variants or peptide fragments thereof. In situ detection may be accomplished by removing a histological specimen from a patient, and applying thereto a labeled IGF-1R-specific binding molecule, preferably applied by overlaying the labeled antibody (or fragment) onto a biological sample. Through the use of such a procedure, it is possible to determine not only the presence of IGF-1R protein, or conserved variants or peptide fragments, but also its distribution in the examined tissue.

    "spended Protein A/G beads (300 \u03bcl, Pierce Cat. No. 20422) were washed with 1\u00d7PBS and mixed with 1.0 mg M13-C06 in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube on a rotary shaker for two hours at room temperature. In a separate tube, 12 \u03bcg hIGF-1R-His<sub>10 </sub>(R&amp;D systems) and 460 ng human IGF-1 (Chemicon International Cat. No. GF006) were mixed (1:1 protein:protein ratio) for one hour at room temperature. Protein A/G with bound M13-C06 was washed with PBS and incubated with the hIGF-1R-His<sub>10</sub>/IGF-1 mixture for 30 minutes at room temperature. Protein A/G with bound protein was washed with PBS followed by elution of bound protein with 300 \u03bcL 100 mM glycine, pH 3.0. For the negative control, the addition of 12 \u03bcg human IGF-1R(1-902)-His<sub>10 </sub>was omitted. Eluted proteins were detected by Western Blot with an anti-human IGF-1 antibody (Rabbit anti-Human IGF-1 Biotin, USBiological Cat. No. I7661-01B) and an anti-human IGF-1R antibody (IGF-1R\u03b1 1H7, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Cat. No. sc-461) as primary antibodies, followed by HRP-labeled streptavidin (Southern Biotech Cat. No. 7100-05) and HRP-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (USBiological Cat. No. I1904-40J) as secondary antibodies. To demonstrate the ability of IGF-1/IGF-1R/M13-C06 to form a ternary complex, the concentrations of the IGF-1 and IGF-1R used in this experiment were well in excess (&gt;15-fold above) the normal physiological levels of these proteins (particularly IGF-1 in the serum) as well as the measured equilibrium dissociation constant for IGF-1R/IGF-1. See, for example, Hankinson et al., 1997.</p>iii. Construction of IGF-1R(1-462)-Fc and Comparative Antibody Binding Studies Versus the Full-Length Receptor Ectodomain</p>Construction of the IGF-1/IGF-2 binding domains, L1-CR-L2 (residues 1-462), of human IGF-1R was published previously (McKern 1997). Utilizing this information, we subcloned human IGF-1R residues 1-462 (along with the N-terminal signal sequence) into the same in-house PV90 vector that was used to produce the full-length human ectodomain (residues 1-903, hIGF-1R-Fc). Expression in CHO was facilitated using methods described previously (Brezinsky 2003). The protein was purified from CHO supernatants by passage over a protein A affinity column as described previously for other Fc-fusion proteins (Demarest 2006). The protein construct is denoted hIGF-1R(1-462)-Fc.</p>The ability of M13-C06, M14-C03, and M14-G11 antibodies to bind hIGF-1R(1-462)-Fc and the full-length ectodomain construct, hIGF-1R-Fc, was determined by SPR using a Biacore3000. The instrument was set to 25\u00b0 C. and the running buffer was HBS-EP, pH 7.2 (Biacore, Cat. No. BR-1001-88). The fully human antibodies, M13-C06, M14-C03, and M14-G11, were immobilized to \u02dc10,000 RU on Biacore CM5 Research Grade Sensor Chip (Cat. No. BR-1000-14) surfaces using the standard NHS/EDC-amine reactive chemistry according to protocols supplied by Biacore. For immobilization, the antibodies were diluted to 40 \u03bcg/mL in a 10 mM Ace",
    "IgG4agly/kappa constant domains), and \u03b1IR3 (Calbiochem, Cat. No. GR11LSP5) were made up in the 320 nM IGF-1 His solution. Dilutions were made from 1.3 \u03bcM to 10 pM for M13-C06 and M14-C03, from 5.2 \u03bcM to 10 pM for M14-G11, and from 2.6 \u03bcM to 10 pM for both P1E2 and \u03b1IR3. Human IGF-2 His (NB12110-10) was prepared at 320 nM in PBST, 1.0 mg/ml BSA. The antibodies were serial diluted (from 1.3 \u03bcM to 5 pM for M13-C06 and M14-C03, from 5.2 \u03bcM to 5 pM for M14-G11 and \u03b1IR3, and from 5.2 \u03bcM to 20 pM for P1E2) using a solution of 320 nM IGF-2 His. The dilutions were added to the plates in duplicate at 100 \u03bcL/well and the plates were incubated at RT for 1 hour. The plates were then washed four times with 200 \u03bcL/well PBST. An HRP-conjugated anti-Histag antibody (Penta-His HRP Conjugate, QIAGEN, Cat. No. 1014992) was diluted 1:1000 in PBST and added to plates at 100 \u03bcL/well, and the plates were incubated at RT for one hour. The plates were then washed four times with 200 \u03bcL/well PBST. SureBlue Reserve TMB Microwell Peroxidase Substrate (KPL, Cat. No. 53-00-01) was added to plates at 100 \u03bcL/well followed by 1% phosphoric acid at 100 \u03bcL/well once the desired reaction was observed. The absorbance of each well was determined at 450 nm, and the results were normalized and plotted against the log of antibody concentration.</p>c. Results</p>(i) Cross-Blocking Properties of the Anti-IGF-1R Antibodies</p>The antibodies were all tested for their ability to cross-block one another in an IGF-1R ELISA binding assay (Table 8). M13-C06 and M14-C03 cross-blocked one another in the assay, but had no cross-blocking activity towards P1E2, \u03b1IR3 or M14-G11 in the assay. P1E2 and \u03b1IR3 were both able to completely cross-block labeled \u03b1IR3 and M14-G11 in the assays. M14-G11 demonstrated moderate cross-blocking activity towards \u03b1IR3 suggesting that M14-G11's epitope may overlap, but not be identical to the epitope(s) of \u03b1IR3 and P1E2.</p>TABLE 8Summary results of antibody cross-blocking experiments.M13-C06 cross-M14-G11 cross-\u03b1IR3 cross-Antibody InhibitorblockingblockingblockingM13-C06+++++\u2212\u2212M14-C03+++++\u2212\u2212M14-G11\u2212++++++++\u03b1IR3\u2212++++++++++P1E2\u2212+++++++++++++++ = antibody binding competition relative to itself (90-100%)++++ = 70-90% competition+++ = 50-70% competition++ = 30-50% competition+ = 10-30% competition+/\u2212 = 0-10% competitionN/A = results not available.</p>Similar cross-blocking results were obtained using a SPR-based assay (FIG. 13A,B). The cross-blocking studies were performed at 40 nM IGF-1R concentrations (\u02dc400-fold above the affinity of M13-C06 and M14-G11 for IGF-1R). The concentrations at which each antibody was capable of completely cross-blocking itself should therefore be a measure of the antibody/IGF-1R stoichiometry. Both M13-C06 and M14-G11 reached self-cross-blocking saturation at 40 nM and 80 nM antibody and Fab concentrations, respectively (FIG. 13A,B; Fab data not shown). The data suggests that both antibodies recognize two sites on the IGF-1R homodimer. While the",

Individual transformed colonies were picked into deep-well 96 well dishes and processed for screening as described above. C06 scFv proteins containing individual and combined stabilizing mutations were tested for: 1) thermal stability in the T<sub>50 </sub>thermal challenge assay, and 2) kinetic off-rates (dissociation constant or k<sub>d</sub>) to IGF-1R-Fc by biolayer interferometry (Octet QK System, ForteBio, Inc. Menlo Park, Calif.). For off-rate analyses IGF-1R Fc was immobilized onto the surface of Protein A biosensors. Culture supernatants containing variant C06 scFvs from thirty clones were screened against the antigen for binding and subsequent dissociation constant analysis. ScFvs were allowed to bind to immobilized IGF-1R Fc for 300-seconds. Off-rate was subsequently assayed for 600 seconds. Dissociation constants (k<sub>d</sub>) were calculated using software provided by the manufacturer and off-rates compared to the k<sub>d </sub>of the conventional C06 scFv. Table 15 summarizes the results of the T<sub>50 </sub>thermal challenge assay and off-rate analyses.

    "s expected based on the equimolar number of binding sites between sIGF-1R(1-903) and the MAbs. Subsequently, the G11 MAb was titrated into solutions containing sIGF-1R(1-903) in the presence of a \u02dc2-fold excess of C06 MAb (FIG. 40A,B). The presence of the C06 MAb did not deter the G11 MAb from strongly engaging the receptor. The stoichiometry of the G11 MAb binding to sIGF-1R(1-903) was also 1:1. The experiments demonstrate the ability of the C06 and G11MAbs to co-engage IGF-1R.</p>Next, the C- and N-terminal IGF-1R bispecific antibodies were titrated into sIGF-1R(1-903) (FIG. 40C,D). Both BsAbs bound strongly and saturated the receptor at a 1:1 molar ratio. The C-term. IGF-1R bispecific antibody demonstrated an incredibly strong enthalpy of binding (\u221254 kcal/mol, Table 25), even greater than what would be expected based on the combination of the enthalpies measured for the C06 and G11 antibodies. Similar to the C06 and G11 MAbs, there were very few titration points in the transition region where saturation of the receptor occurs\u2014suggestive of very tight binding (FIG. 40D). The N-term. IGF-1R bispecific antibody also showed a strong enthalpy (\u221243 kcal/mol, Table 25), albeit less than what was observed for the C-term. IGF-1R bispecific antibody. Additionally, there was more curvature (and more titration points) in the transition region for defining the affinity of the N-term. IGF-1R bispecific antibody to sIGF-1R(1-903). This enabled the measurement of an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant, K<sub>D</sub>, of II nM (FIG. 40D, Table 25). These results suggest the binding affinity of the N-terminal IGF-1R bispecific antibody may be lower than that of the C-terminal IGF-1R bispecific antibody.</p>An interesting aspect of the ITC experiments is that they cannot distinguish whether the C06 scFv or the G11 Fv within the IgG1 portion of the BsAbs are capable of occluding each other for binding to the receptor. Even if they were 100% mutually exclusive, there would still be two active ends of the molecule enabling the 1:1 stoichiometry that is observed. However, the difference in the binding enthalpy of the two molecules combined with the weaker apparent affinity of the N-terminal IGF-1R bispecific antibody suggest the N-terminal BsAb may not be fully capable of binding the IGF-1R using all its binding sites. The binding moieties (i.e. the C06 scFv and the G11 antibody Fv) are identical within the two tetravalent formats; however, there relative position/spacing in the two formats is significantly different. It seems possible that steric hindrance between the scFv and the Fv may lead to subtle differences in the binding properties between the C- and N-term.

Solution phase binding experiments were performed to investigate the ability of the N- and C-terminal BsAbs to bind IGF-1R using all 4 potential binding sites\u20142 sites to each epitope on IGF-1R.</p>i. Methods</p>Equilibrium Fab, MAb, and BsAb Binding to IGF-1R Using Surface Plasmon Resonance. All experiments were performed on a Biacore3000 instrument (Biacore). The C06 and G11 MAbs were separately immobilized to two different flow cell surfaces of a standard CM5 chip surface using standard amine chemistry protocols provided by the manufacturer. At these high immobilization levels of MAb, flowing low concentrations of sIGF-1R(1-903) (&lt;50 nM) led to mass-transfer limited linear binding curves whose initial velocity of binding, V<sub>i </sub>(RU/s), depended linearly on the concentration of the sIGF-1R(1-903) solution flowed over the chip surface. Binding constants and stoichiometries of binding between sIGF-1R(1-903) (described in Example 9b) and the Fabs/MAbs/BsAbs could be determined by flowing mixtures of sIGF-1R(1-903) and antibody over the sensorchip surface containing C06 or G11. The C06 and G1 sensorchip surface measures the concentration of unbound sIGF-1R(1-903) in solutions containing sIGF-1R(1-903) and antibody. The equilibrium dissociation constant, K<sub>D</sub>, and binding stoichiometry between the antibodies and sIGF-1R(1-903) is determined by the concentration of unbound sIGF-1R(1-903) using the equation below:</p>Vi=m\u00b7[[IGF-1\ue89eR]T-12\ue89e{(n\ue8a0[Ab]T+[IGF-1\ue89eR]T+KD)-(n\ue8a0[Ab]T+[IGF-1\ue89eR]T+KD)2-4\ue89en\ue8a0[Ab]T\ue8a0[IGF-1\ue89eR]T}]</p>where V<sub>i</sub>=initial rate of binding, m=slope of the sIGF-1R(1-903) concentration-dependent standard curve, [IGF-1R]<sub>f</sub>=unbound IGF-1R concentration, [IGF-1R]<sub>t</sub>=total IGF-1 concentration and [Ab]<sub>t</sub>=total Fab/MAb/BsAb concentration (Day, E.S., Cachero, T.G., Qian, F., Sun, Y., Wen, D., Pelletier, M., Hsu, Y.-M., Whitty, A.

Results</p>Equilibrium solution phase surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed to investigate the ability of all four binding sites of the tetravalent IGF-1R bispecific antibodies to bind to their appropriate epitopes. To test the binding to each epitope, C06 and G11 were immobilized to different sensor chip surfaces and used to probe whether the FnIII-1 and CRR epitopes on sIGF-1R(\u22121903), respectively, are unencumbered. The binding of the soluble IGF-1R ectodomain to the C06 surface and G11 surface was tested in the presence of varying amounts of N- and C-terminal IGF-1R bispecific antibodies (FIG. 41A,B). C06 and G11 MAbs and Fabs were used a controls for demonstrating a stoichiometry of binding of 1:1 and 2:1 antibody:receptor, respectively. It is important to note that the C06 MAb and Fab do not lead to inhibition of the G11 surface binding to sIGF-1R(1-903) and the G11 MAb and Fab do not lead to inhibition of the C06 surface binding to sI",

Methods</p>Equilibrium BsAb (in serum) binding to multiple epitopes of IGF-1R using surface plasmon resonance. All experiments were performed on a Biacore3000 instrument (Biacore). The C06 and G11 MAbs were separately immobilized to two different flow cell surfaces of a standard CM5 chip surface using standard amine chemistry protocols provided by the manufacturer. At these high immobilization levels of MAb, flowing low concentrations of sIGF-1R(1-903) (&lt;50 nM) led to mass-transfer limited linear binding curves whose initial velocity of binding, V<sub>i </sub>(RU/s), depended linearly on the concentration of the sIGF-1R(1-903) solution flowed over the chip surface. The stoichiometry of binding between sIGF-1R(1-903) and the N- and C-terminal IGF-1R bispecific antibody was determined by flowing mixtures of sIGF-1R(1-903) and BsAb (serially diluted from serum) over the sensorchip surfaces containing C06 MAb, G11 MAb, or a blank surface blocked by ethanolamine after being activated using the standard NHC/EDC immobilization chemistry. The C06 and G11 sensorchip surfaces measure the concentration of unbound sIGF-1R(1-903) in solutions containing sIGF-1R(1-903) and the BsAbs. The binding stoichiometry, n, between the BsAbs and each sIGF-1R(1-903) epitope is determined by the concentration of unbound sIGF-1R(1-903) using the equation below:</p>Vi=m\u00b7[[IGF-1\ue89eR]T-12\ue89e{(n\ue8a0[BsAb]T+[IGF-1\ue89eR]T+KD)-(n\ue8a0[BsAb]T+[IGF-1\ue89eR]T+KD)2-4\ue89en\ue8a0[Ab]T\ue8a0[IGF-1\ue89eR]T}]</p>where V<sub>i</sub>=initial rate of binding, m=slope of the sIGF-1R(1-903) concentration-dependent standard curve, [IGF-1R]<sub>f</sub>=unbound IGF-1R concentration=V<sub>i</sub>/m, [IGF-1R]<sub>t</sub>=total IGF-1 concentration and [BsAb]<sub>t </sub>total BsAb concentration (Day 2005). The stock concentrations of BsAb (within the serum) were determined by ELISA as described in the BsAb PK example.</p>ii. Results</p>The amount of intact/active C- and N-terminal IGF-1R bispecific antibody in serum collected from mice that were injected with 10 mg/kg of either BsAb after 1, 6, 24, and 168 hrs was assessed using solution Biacore measurements. The activity of the BsAb was measured as its ability to bind with full capability to both the G11 and C06 epitopes. Each serum sample doped with sIGF-1R(1-903) (30 nM, in-house ectodomain reagent) was serial diluted with a solution of 30 nM sIGF-1R(1-903). The samples were run over both C06 and G11 immobilized sensor chips to detect the ability of the BsAbs to block the ability of the sIGF-1R(1-903) from binding to the sensorchip surfaces. Time points at the 2 week period of the PK study were not measured for activity because the serum levels were expected to drop below the level where we could accurately determine the binding activity/stoichiometry using our Biacore method.</p>Both the C- and N-terminal IGF-1R bispecific antibodies appeared to retain full activity after being circulated in serum over the cou"
