{"raw_mentions": "Here is the extracted sentence:\n\n[0136] Activity of compounds of the formula I was shown by an Eu based binding assay in which the binding of human von Willebrand factor to an europium (Eu)-chelate-labeled chimeric GPIb-Fc protein was induced by botrocetin. The preparation of the Eu-chelate-labeled chimeric GPIb-Fc protein is described in detail in a patent application (Fukuchi et al., EP1074564). IC50 (inhibition for 50%) values of all the compounds of the formula I were less than 100 microM."}

{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that meet the specified criteria. The text does not contain sentences with a specific molecule name, a bioactivity metric (IC50, Ki, Kd, EC50), a numeric value, and a unit. The text appears to describe the synthesis and characterization of compounds, as well as an assay protocol, but does not provide the required information."}
