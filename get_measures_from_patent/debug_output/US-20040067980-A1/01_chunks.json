    "ble precursor groups. In addition, a conversion into a physiologically tolerable salt or a prodrug of a compound of the formula I can then be carried out by known processes. </p>[0133] In general, a reaction mixture containing a final compound of the formula I or an intermediate is worked up and, if desired, the product is then purified by customary processes known to those skilled in the art. For example, a synthesized compound can be purified using well known methods such as crystallization, chromatography or reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) or other methods of separation based, for example, on the size, charge or hydrophobicity of the compound. Similarly, well known methods such as NMR, IR and mass spectrometry (MS) can be used for characterizing a compound of the invention. </p>[0134] The reactions described above and below that are carried out in the syntheses of the compounds of the formula I can generally be carried out according to the methods of conventional solution phase chemistry. Preferred methods include, but are not limited to those described in the examples. </p>[0135] The compounds of the present invention inhibit the initial step of the thrombogenesis. In particular, they are inhibitors of the interaction between the platelet surface glycoprotein GPIb complex and the plasma protein von Willebrand factor and preferably do not show an essential modulation of the chemokine receptor activity as e.g. measured in a CCR-1 and/or CCR-5 binding assay as disclosed e.g. in Van Riper et al. (1993) J. Exp. Med., 177, 851-856 or in a CCR-2 and/or CCR-3 binding assay as disclosed in e.g. Daugherty et al. (1996) J. Exp. Med., 183, 2349-2354. </p>[0136] Activity of compounds of the formula I was shown by an Eu based binding assay in which the binding of human von Willebrand factor to an europium (Eu)-chelate-labeled chimeric GPIb-Fc protein was induced by botrocetin. The preparation of the Eu-chelate-labeled chimeric GPIb-Fc protein is described in detail in a patent application (Fukuchi et al., EP1074564). IC<sub>50 </sub>(inhibition for 50%) values of all the compounds of the formula I were less than 100 microM. </p>[0137] In view of their ability to inhibit the interaction between GPIb and vWF the compounds of the formula I are useful pharmacologically active compounds which are suitable, for example, for influencing the platelet aggregation and for the treatment, including therapy and prophylaxis, of diseases such as, for example, cardiovascular disorders, thromboembolic diseases or restenoses. </p>[0138] The invention also relates to the treatment of disease states such as abnormal thrombus formation, myocardial infarction, acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, acute coronary syndromes, coronary artery disease, reocclusion following coronary thrombolysis, occlusion during thromboplasty, coronary restenosis, thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, left ventricular dysfunction, secondary prevention of clinical vascular complications in patients with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease,acute vessel closure associated with thrombolytic therapy or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, transient ischemic attacks, stroke, atherosclerosis, comedication to vascular inte",
