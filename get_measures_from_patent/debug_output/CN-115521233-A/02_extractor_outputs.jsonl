FIG. 7 shows the results of in vitro experiments on JG-1, as shown in FIG. 7, JG-1 has excellent in vitro activity (EC 50=20nM,% maximum activation =125% in ROR \u03b3 dual fluorescence emission transfer (dual FRET) assay).\n2. Staining cells and detecting CD4 by flow method + IL-17A + Cell ratio, and drug activation efficiency at different concentrations = (drug administration group-control group)/control group = 100% was calculated, with an EC50 value of 11.21nM.\n3. FIG. 10 is a graph comparing the effect of LYC-55716 on Type17 cell differentiation in 8-074 and LYC-5574 according to one embodiment of the present invention, as shown in FIG. 10, 8-074 significantly increased CD4 + T and CD8 + CD4 in T cells + IL-17A + Th17 cells, and added 20nM drug treatment during the differentiation of Th17 and Tc17 cells, respectively."}
