In vitro assay of JG-1</p>FIG. 7 shows the results of in vitro experiments on JG-1, as shown in FIG. 7, JG-1 has excellent in vitro activity (EC 50=20nM,% maximum activation =125% in ROR \u03b3 dual fluorescence emission transfer (dual FRET) assay).</p>Overall, JG-1 treated CD4 <sup>+</sup> The proportion of Th17 cells in T cells was significantly increased and JG-1 treatment also reduced CD4 compared to the in vitro control group <sup>+</sup> Treg proportion in T cells, CD8 treated with JG-1 <sup>+</sup> The proportion of Tc17 cells in the T cells is obviously increased compared with the control group, which shows that JG-1 can stimulate the in vitro differentiation of Th17 and Tc17 cells in the T cells and inhibit Treg cellsDifferentiation in vitro; meanwhile, compared with an IgG group, the JG-1 group has obviously reduced tumor volume in an MC38 colon cancer tumor model, compared with an IgG group, the JG-1 group has obviously reduced tumor volume in a B16F10 melanoma immune mouse model, and JG-1 not only has stronger dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition effect, but also has synergistic inhibition effect with anti-ctla-4.</p>Example 3</p>This example provides compounds of formula 1-2, for ease of description the following are shown at 8-074:</p></p>1.8-074 enhancement of human and mouse Type17 cell differentiation in vitro</p>1.8-074 promoting mouse Type17 cell differentiation</p>1.1, obtaining lymphocytes from the spleen of a normal C57BL/6 mouse, and purifying by using an in-vitro sorting kit to obtain CD4 <sup>+</sup> T cells, mimic T Cell Receptor (TCR) signals with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies, and are added with cytokines IL-6 and TGF-beta for in vitro induced differentiation. During the differentiation, 8-074 was added at a concentration of 0nM,2.5nM,5.0nM,10.0nM, 20.0nM,40.0nM,80.0nM,160.0nM, respectively, and after 5 days of culture, cytokine secretion was blocked, and the differentiated cells and culture supernatant were collected.</p>Staining cells and detecting CD4 by flow method <sup>+</sup> IL-17A <sup>+</sup> Cell ratio, and drug activation efficiency at different concentrations = (drug administration group-control group)/control group = 100% was calculated. The fitting model used by Prism was used: y = Bottom + (Top-Bottom)/(1 + 10) <sup>(LogEC50-X)</sup> * Hillslope) and fig. 8 is a dose-dependent curve for different concentrations of 8-074, as shown in fig. 8, with an EC50 value of 11.21nM.</p>An ELISA experiment is used for detecting IL-17A in the culture supernatant, fig. 9 shows that the expression quantity of the Th17 effector IL-17A is measured by different concentrations of 8-074, as shown in fig. 9, the secretion of the Th17 effector IL-17A can be remarkably promoted by the 8-074, and the action effect of the Th17 effector IL-17A is in a concentration-dependent mode within a certain concentration range. * P &lt;0.05; * P &lt;0.0001</p>1.2, in order to evaluate the drug effect of ROR gamma t agonist 8-074, we used the ROR gamma agonist LYC-55716 which had entered clinical trial as a positive control, and added 20nM drug treatment during the differentiation of Th17 and Tc17 cells, respectively, and blocked cytokine secretion after 5 days, and the degree of differentiation of Type17 cells was measured by flow cytometry.</p>FIG. 10 is a graph comparing the effect of LYC-55716 on Type17 cell differentiation in 8-074 and LYC-5574 according to one embodiment of the present invention, as shown in FIG. 10, 8-074 significantly increased CD4 <sup>+</sup> T and CD8 <sup>+</sup> CD4 in T cells <sup>+</sup> IL-17A <sup>+</sup> Th17 cells (on FIG. 10A) and CD8 <sup>+</sup> IL-17A <sup>+</sup> Proportion of Tc17 cells (FIG. 10A). It can also be seen that under the same drug concentration treatment, the stimulation efficiency of 8-074 and LYC-55716 on Th17 cells was 98.3% and 88.4%, respectively (FIG. 10B), and Tc17 cells was 127.3% and 85.9%, respe",
    ". 15, the tumor growth rate of the Anti-PD-1 combined group 8-074 (tumor inhibition rate 89.7%) mice is significantly slower than that of the Anti-PD-1 single administration group 8-074 (tumor inhibition rate 59.3%) and that of the Anti-PD-1 single administration group (tumor inhibition rate 12%).</p>3.2 staining and analyzing the infiltration of different immunocytes in tumor tissues of LLC model mice, FIG. 16 shows the infiltration of immunocytes in tumor tissues of mice under different administration modes, and as shown in FIG. 16, we found that the combination of 8-074 and Anti-PD-1 increased the total tumor immunocyte infiltration and CD8 infiltration compared to the group of 8-074 alone and the group of Anti-PD-1 alone <sup>+</sup> Infiltration of T cells. On the other hand, the combination group had a reduced proportion of intratumoral Treg cells compared to the Anti-PD-1 group alone, resulting in a significant increase in the CD8/Treg ratio. This result demonstrates that 8-074 in combination with Anti-PD-1 produces a synergistic or additive effect, and that 8-074 can increase intratumoral CD8 <sup>+</sup> Infiltration of T cells increased the response rate of Anti-PD-1. * P&lt;0.05,**P&lt;0.01,***P&lt;0.001and****P&lt; 0.0001</p>Example 4</p>This example provides compounds of formulae 1-3, represented for ease of description as A4 below:</p></p>fig. 17 is a test chart of the activation effect of the compound A4 on Th17 cells, and it can be found from fig. 17 that the EC50 of the compound A4 on Th17 cell activation is 20.62nM, which indicates that the compound A4 can effectively activate Th17 cells, thereby improving the immunity of the organism, improving the tumor killing ability of immune cells, and effectively controlling the growth of tumors.</p>Finally, it should be noted that: the above embodiments are only used to illustrate the technical solution of the present invention, and not to limit the same; while the invention has been described in detail and with reference to the foregoing embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that: the technical solutions described in the foregoing embodiments may still be modified, or some or all of the technical features may be equivalently replaced; and such modifications or substitutions do not depart from the spirit and scope of the respective technical solutions of the embodiments of the present invention.</p>"
