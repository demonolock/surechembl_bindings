Brief Description of the Figures Figures 1A depict the percentage GFP+ of cells at different concentrations of compounds DCD-101, DCD-102, DCD-103, DCD-104, DCD-105, DCD-106, DCD-108, DCD-112, DCD-113, DCD-114, DCD115, and DCD-116, DCD118, DCD-119, DCD-120, DCD-121, DCD-122, DCD-123, DCD-124, DCD-125, DCD-126, DCD-127, DCD-128, DCD-129, DCD-130, DCD-131, DCD-132, DCD-133, DCD-134, DCD-135, DCD-136, DCD-137, DCD-138, DCD-139, DCD-140, DCD-141, DCD-142, DCD-143, DCD-144, DCD-145, DCD-146, DCD-147, DCD-148, DCD-149, DCD-150, DCD-151, DCD-152, DCD-153, DCD-154, DCD-155, DCD-156, DCD-157, DCD-158, DCD-159 and \u03b1-GalCer at varying concentrations. Figure 1B depict the EC50 of the dose responses shown in Figure 1A. Figure 2A depicts the amount of interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion in response to a 48 hour incubation with compounds DCD-101, DCD-102, DCD-104, DCD-105, DCD-106 and \u03b1-GalCer in a dose response of 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 ug/mL. Figure 3A depicts the secretion of the cytokine interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3) in response to activation by compounds DCD-101, DCD-104, DCD-106 and \u03b1-GalCer. \n\n Figure 3B depicts the secretion of the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) in response to activation by compounds DCD-101, DCD-104, DCD-106 and \u03b1-GalCer. Figure 3C depicts the secretion of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) in response to activation by compounds DCD-101, DCD-104, DCD-106 and \u03b1-GalCer. Figure 4A depicts the activation of C57BL/6J immune cells, as measured by the serum IFN\u03b3 using ELISA, in response to injection of the compounds DCD-101, DCD-119, DCD-123, DCD125, DCD127, DCD-128, DCD-134, DCD-142, DCD-145, DCD-146, DCD- 147, DCD-148, DCD-149, DCD-150, DCD-151, DCD-152, DCD-153, DCD-154, DCD-155, DCD-156, and DCD-157, DCD-158, and DCD-159 with comparison to \u03b1GalCer twenty hours after injection. Figure 4B depicts the expansion of iNKT cells in the C57BL/6J mouse spleen in response to injection of the compounds DCD-101, DCD-104, DCD-106, DCD-119, DCD- 142, DCD-145, DCD-146, DCD-147, DCD-148, DCD-149, DCD-150, DCD-151, DCD-152, DCD-153, DCD-154, DCD-155, DCD-156, DCD-157, DCD-158, and DCD-159 with comparison to \u03b1GalCer.
