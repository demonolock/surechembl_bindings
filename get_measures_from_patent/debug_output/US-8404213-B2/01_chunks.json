    "both aging and AD.</p>There remains debate as to whether plaques and tangles are byproducts of the neurodegenerative process found in AD or whether they are the cause of neuronal cell death. Ross, Current Opinion in Neurobiol. 96:644-650 (1996); Terry, J. of Neuropath. &amp; Exp. Neurol. 55:1023-1025 (1996); Terry, J Neural Transmission\u2014Suppl. 53:141-145 (1998). Evidence is clear that neocortical and hippocampal synapse loss correlates well with pre-morbid cognitive status. Some researchers suggest that disruption of microtubule structure and function, caused by the hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein, tau, plays the key etiologic role in synapse loss in particular and AD in general. Terry, J. of Neuropath. &amp; Exp. Neurol. 55:1023-1025 (1996); Terry, J of Neural Transmission\u2014Suppl. 53:141-145 (1998). Oxidative damage and membrane breakdown have been proposed to play important roles in AD. Perry, Free Radical Biology &amp; Medicine 28:831-834 (2000); Pettegrew et al., Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 826:282-306 (1997). Vascular factors including subtle, chronic cerebral hypoperfusion also have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. De la Torre, Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 903:424-436 (2000); Di Iorio et al., Aging (Milano) 11:345-352 (1999). While all of these factors are likely to play some role in the pathogenesis of AD, increasing evidence points to abnormalities in the processing of the amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) peptide, a 4 kD peptide that aggregates into a fibrillar, \u03b2-pleated sheet structure. Glenner and Wong, Biochemical &amp; Biophysical Research Communications 120:885-890 (1984). A\u03b2 has been proposed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD for several reasons: 1) A\u03b2 deposits are the earliest neuropathological markers of AD in Down's Syndrome, and can precede NFT formation by several decades Mann et al., Neurodegeneration 1:201-215 (1992); Naslund, et al., JAMA 283:1571-1577 (2000). 2) \u03b2-amyloidosis is relatively specific to AD and closely related disorders; Selkoe, Trends in Neurosciences 16:403-409 (1993); 3) A\u03b2 is toxic to cultured neurons, Yankner Neurobiol. Aging 13:615-616 (1992); Mattson et al., J. Neuroscience 12:376-389 (1992); Shearman et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:1470-1474 (1994), a toxicity that appears to be dependent on \u03b2-sheet secondary structure and aggregation into at least oligomers. Lambert et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95:6448-6453 (1989); Pike et al., J. Neuroscience 13:1676-1687 (1993); Simmons et al., Molecular Pharmacology 45:373-379 (1994). Although A\u03b2 surely exists in an equilibrium distributed across monomeric, oligomeric and fibrillar/plaque fractions, the oligomeric form of A\u03b2 has been strongly implicated as the key neurotoxic component. Selkoe, Alzheimer disease, edited by R. D. Terry, et al, pp. 293-310 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia (1999); Selkoe, Science 298, 789-91 (2002).

It has been determined that ThS competed with [<sup>3</sup>H]CG for binding sites on A\u03b2(1-40), but ThT did not (see, e.g., FIG. 5). High specific activity [N-methyl-<sup>11</sup>C]BTA-1 (see Table 1) was then synthesized by methylation of BTA-0. Bindings studies were performed with [N-methyl-<sup>11</sup>C]BTA-1 and 200 nM A\u03b2(1-40) fibrils. The specific binding of [N-methyl-<sup>11</sup>C]BTA-1 was \u02dc70%. FIG. 5 (see the right panel) shows competition curves for A\u03b2 sites by ThT, BTA-0, BTA-1, and BTA-2 using the [N-methyl-<sup>11</sup>C]BTA-1 binding assay.

Not only is the quaternary amine of ThT not necessary for binding to A\u03b2 fibrils, it appears to decrease binding affinity as well.</p>In Table 1 below are five different <sup>11</sup>C-labeled BTA derivatives where their in vitro binding properties, logP values, and in vivo brain uptake and retention properties in mice have been determined.</p>TABLE 1In vitro and in vivo properties of several promising <sup>11</sup>C-labeled Thioflavin T derivatives.Ratio ofK<sub>i</sub>Mouse BrainMouse Brain2 min/30(nM)Uptake @ 2Uptake @ 30minStructure of <sup>11</sup>C-Labeledto A\u03b2minminUptakeBTA CompoundfibrilslogP(% ID/g*kg)(% ID/g*kg)Values<img id=\"EMI-C00018\" path=\"US08404213-20130326-C00018.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/228057847/US/20130326/B2/000008/40/42/13/US08404213-20130326-C00018.TIF\"/>213.3 (est.)0.32 \u00b1 0.07\u20020.17 \u00b1 0.051.9 <img id=\"EMI-C00019\" path=\"US08404213-20130326-C00019.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/228057900/US/20130326/B2/000008/40/42/13/US08404213-20130326-C00019.TIF\"/>not tested3.9 (est.)0.15 \u00b1 0.06\u20020.16 \u00b1 0.020.9 <img id=\"EMI-C00020\" path=\"US08404213-20130326-C00020.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/228057808/US/20130326/B2/000008/40/42/13/US08404213-20130326-C00020.TIF\"/>301.9 (est.)0.60 \u00b1 0.04\u20020.39 \u00b1 0.051.5 <img id=\"EMI-C00021\" path=\"US08404213-20130326-C00021.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org",

Moreover, the 30 min brain radioactivity concentration values were less than 0.1% ID/g*kg, resulting in 2 min-to-30 min concentration ratios &gt;4. Both of the N,N-dimethyl compounds cleared less rapidly from mouse brain tissue than the N-methyl derivatives. Likewise, the only primary amine currently testable, 6-MeO-BTA-0, showed poor brain clearance.

Brain imaging studies were conducted following the intravenous injection of 3-5 mCi of radiotracer. Typical attenuation- and decay-corrected time-activity curves for a frontal cortex region of interest for each of the three compounds are shown in FIG. 6. It is noted that the absolute brain uptake of these 3 compounds in baboons is very similar to that in mice (i.e., about 0.47 to 0.39% ID/g*kg). However, the normal brain clearance rate of all three radiotracers is considerably slower in baboons compared to mice, with peak-to-60 min ratios in the range of 2.4 to "
