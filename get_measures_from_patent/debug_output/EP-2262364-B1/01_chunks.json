Within the context of the present invention, a modulator of GLP-1R may be an agonist, antagonist, partial agonist, partial antagonist, inverse agonist or inverse antagonist. In one embodiment, compounds of the invention are agonists of GLP-1R. In another embodiment, compounds of the invention are antagonists of GLP-1R.</p>Within the context of the present invention, a GLP-1R agonist is understood to refer to any compound which fully or partially activates the human GLP-1 receptor. Within the context of the present invention, a partial GLP-1 R agonist is understood to refer to any compound which increases the activity of the human GLP-1 receptor but which compared to GLP-1 itself, is not able to effect a full response (E<sub>max</sub> &lt; 100% relative to GLP-1). Within the context of the present invention, a GLP-1 antagonist is understood to refer to any compound which decreases the activity of the human GLP-1 receptor seen after stimulation with GLP-1. Within the context of the present invention, GLP-1 is understood to refer to either or both of the two known native forms GLP-1 (7-36) and GLP-1 (7-37).</p>In general, embodiments of the present invention useful for pharmaceutical applications may have EC50's as determined by the method for determining the ability to stimulate cAMP formation in a cell line expressing the cloned GLP-1R, such as the one described below, of less than 100 \u00b5M. Embodiments of the present invention useful for pharmaceutical applications may have EC50's of less than 10 \u00b5M. For particalular medical indications, EC50's lower than 0.01 \u00b5M may be useful. Thus, in another embodiment, compounds of the present invention may have EC50's in a range of about 0.001 \u00b5M to about 10 \u00b5M. In another embodiment, compounds of the present invention may have EC50's of about 0.01 \u00b5M to about 3 \u00b5M.

Membranes from HEK-293 or CHO cells expressing the human GLP-1 receptor were used in the GLP-1 receptor binding assay. Reactions were carried out in 96-well plates. Compound was diluted in 20% DMSO/ water. The final assay concentration ranging from 0.1 nM to 100 uM in 2% final DMSO concentration was used. The final binding assay conditions were 25 mM Tris-HCL, pH 7.4 buffer containing 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.1% BSA, 1 - 10 ug membrane, 20 - 200 pM [<sup>125</sup>I]GLP-1 aa (7-36) (SA=2200 Ci/mmoL, (Perkin Elmer part no. NEX308), and compound in final DMSO concentration of 2% (final assay volume of 100 uL). Positive control wells (C+) lacked compound, and negative control wells (C-) lacked compound and contained cold excess GLP-1 (1 \u00b5M). Non-specific binding (NSB) was determined for each compound concentration by addition of cold excess GLP-1 (1 \u00b5M). The reaction was carried out at room temp for 120 min. Membrane containing bound an [<sup>125</sup>I]GLP-1(aa 7-36) ligand was isolated following filtration onto Unifilter-96 GF/C filter plates (PerkinElmer part no. 6005177) using a cell harvester instrument. Plates were washed 5 times with cold 25 mM Tris-HCL, pH 7.5 containing 0.05% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Following filtration, 50\u00b5L of Microscint PS (Packard part no. 6013631) was added, plates were sealed with TopSeal-A adhesive seals (Packard part no. 6005185). <sup>125</sup>I isotope bound to the Unifilter-96 GF/C plates was counted using a TopCount instrument (Packard).</p>Receptor binding data typically ranged from about 40% to about 100% binding vs [<sup>125</sup>I]GLP-1. For example, the compound of Example 15 exhibited 68% binding, the compound of Example 39 exhibited 60% binding, the compound of Example 88 exhibited 60% binding, the compound of example 89 exhibited 44% binding, and the compound of Example 95 exhibited 65% binding.</p>Data AnalysisPercent inhibition of [<sup>125</sup>I] GLP-1 (aa 7-36) binding was calculated according to the equation 100 x 1-{(Sample<sub>cpm</sub> - NSB<sub>cpm</sub>)/C+<sub>cpm</sub> - C-<sub>cpm</sub>)}. Percent inhibition of [<sup>125</sup>I]GLP-1 binding (Y) vs compound concentration (X) data were generated. The IC<sub>50</sub> values were calculated by fitting the data using parameters for a sigmoidal dose response, variable slope nonlinear regression (GraphPAD Prizm, San Diego, CA) according to the equation: Y=Bottom + (Top-Bottom)/(1+10^((LogEC50-X)*HillSlope))\nwherein, X is the logarithm of concentration and Y is the response, and Y starts at Bottom and goes to Top with a sigmoid shape. This is identical to the four parameter logistic equation.</p>Example 105: Functional cell-based assayThe efficacy of GLP-1 receptor agonists was studied in a cAMP functional assay using either CHO or HEK-293 Cells expressing the cloned human GLP-1 receptor. GLP-1-expressing cells (10,000 cells per 0.1 mL) were plated in 96-well plates in Dulbecco's modified eagles media (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin. Following overnight incubation of cells, media was removed, and compounds (at concentrations ranging from 0.0001 to 100 \u00b5M) were added to monolayer cells in Iscove's modified dulbecco's medium (IMDM), 100 \u00b5M RO 20-1724 PDE inhibitor, 0.1% BSA, 2% DMSO in a final volume of 100 \u00b5L, and incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C 95%O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in a humidified incubator. cAMP was quantitated using a homogenous time-resolved fluorescence detection system (cAMP dynamic, CIS bio International). GLP-1 produced cAMP production dose response curves with EC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 0.01 \u00b5M - 100 \u00b5M, typically ranging from about 0.02 \u00b5M to about 10\u00b5M. Receptor activation was expressed as percentage relative to maximal GLP-1-induced cAMP accumulation. Percent GLP-1 activation vs compound concentration dose response curves were generated by fitting the data using a sigmoidal dose response curve-fitting program (GraphPAD Prizm).</p>The Table below shows EC-50 and activation data for the above exemplary compounds of the present invention.\nExample #EC-50 (nM)% activationExample #EC-50 (nM)% activation19001526707.83nana438002053000018636007.07474358134649500541041851116067112427611312105914450771514599.6166577817699801827074.71918169.92041783.52139970.32289173.523128065.524160053.02559412.026109714.027ndNd2839829.0292901730nana31100013.0327008.33313007.03416031.035120016.03666013.03749032.03871032.03913056.040120034.04143042.042100056.04350034.044100025.045100018.046100022.047120029.04889564.04955757.050122049.05182030.05281033.053104052.554107811.85521649.45637040.15757020.05856545.05975052.060163062.06185029.062100015.06347623.06419036.06522032.06695021.067115055.068110033.06957451.0709886.9717934972nana73nana7432719.075244207611358.127717065378ndnd79ndnd8066.0168170.02582ndnd83710188492043852000558659.3588764.58288ndnd89ndnd9012314391725399272330931383194424419536449963628.59738.238986264299100028na : Not active in the functional cell-based assay of Example 105.\nnd : No data available for this compound in the functional cell-based assay of Example 105.</p>The specificity of GLP-1 agonists for GLP-1 receptor was confirmed by performing the assay with vector-control mock cells which lack the cloned human GLP-1 receptor.
