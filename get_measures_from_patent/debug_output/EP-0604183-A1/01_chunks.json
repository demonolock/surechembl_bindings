Purified HIV-1 protease was obtained as described above. The resulting solution is incubated for one hour at room temperature and then 20 \u00b5L of a solution containing the substrate, N<sup>\u03b1</sup>-Biotin-Gly-Ser-Gln-Asn-Tyr-Pro-Ile-Val-Gly-Lys(N<sup>\u03b5</sup>-FITC)-OH, in MES-ALB buffer (1.5 \u00b5l/ml) is added to each well. The solutions are then incubated for 16 hours at room temperature and then each well is diluted with 150 \u00b5L of MES-ALB buffer.</p>To each well of a second round bottom, 96-well Pandex plate is added 25 uL of the Avidin Coated Beads Solution. Then, to each well is added 25 \u00b5L of the diluted incubation solutions, prepared above. The solutions are mixed thoroughly and the plates are loaded into a Pandex\u00ae machine, washed, evacuated and read. Sample detection was performed by excitation at 485 nm, reading the resulting epifluorescence at 535 nm.</p>The IC\u2085\u2080 results obtained in the Fluorescence Assay for the compounds of the present invention are set forth below in Table 1. All values have been normalized to a positive control which is [1S-(1R*, 4R*, 5S*)]-N-(1-(2-amino-2-oxoethyl)-2-oxo-3-aza-4-phenylmethyl-5-hydroxy-6-(2-(1-t-butylamino-1- oxomethyl)phenyl)hexyl)-2-quinolinyl carboxamide. \nTable 1Inhibitory Activity of Formula I CompoundsExample No.Fluorescense Assay IC\u2085\u2080 in ng/mLControl1.010.1620.9930.8849.850.1661.570.72811.2</p>"
