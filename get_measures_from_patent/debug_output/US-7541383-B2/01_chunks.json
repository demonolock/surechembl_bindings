    "t about 80% identical to a native DP, more preferably at least about 90% identical, and most preferably at least about 95% identical.</p>The terms \u201cmodulate\u201d, \u201cmodulation\u201d and the like refer to the ability of a compound to increase or decrease the function and/or expression of CRTH2 and/or one or more other PGD<sub>2 </sub>receptors, e.g., DP, where such function may include transcription regulatory activity and/or protein-binding. Modulation may occur in vitro or in vivo. Modulation, as described herein, includes the inhibition, antagonism, partial antagonism, activation, agonism or partial agonism of a function or characteristic associated with CRTH2 and/or one or more other PGD<sub>2 </sub>receptors, either directly or indirectly, and/or the upregulation or downregulation of the expression of CRTH2 and/or one or more other PGD<sub>2 </sub>receptors, either directly or indirectly. In a preferred embodiment, the modulation is direct. Inhibitors or antagonists are compounds that, e.g., bind to, partially or totally block stimulation, decrease, prevent, inhibit, delay activation, inactivate, desensitize, or downregulate signal transduction. Activators or agonists are compounds that, e.g., bind to, stimulate, increase, open, activate, facilitate, enhance activation, activate, sensitize or upregulate signal transduction. The ability of a compound to inhibit the function of CRTH2 and/or one or more other PGD<sub>2 </sub>receptors can be demonstrated in a biochemical assay, e.g., binding assay, or a cell-based assay, e.g., a transient transfection assay.</p>The term \u201cCRTH2-modulating amount\u201d refers to that amount of a compound that is needed to produce a desired effect in any one of the cell-based assays, biochemical assays or animal models described herein or otherwise known to the skilled artisan. Typically, a CRTH2-modulating amount of a compound will be at least that amount which exhibits an EC<sub>50 </sub>in a reporter-gene cell-based assay (relative to an untreated control).</p>As used herein, the terms \u201cCRTH2-responsive condition or disorder,\u201d \u201ccondition or disorder responsive to CRTH2\u201d and related terms and phrases refer to a condition or disorder associated with inappropriate, e.g., less than or greater than normal, CRTH2 activity and at least partially responsive to or affected by CRTH2 modulation (e.g., a CRTH2 antagonist or agonist results in some improvement in patient well-being in at least some patients). Inappropriate CRTH2 functional activity might arise as the result of CRTH2 expression in cells which normally do not express CRTH2, increased CRTH2 expression or degree of intracellular activation (leading to, e.g., inflammatory and immune-related disorders and diseases) or decreased CRTH2 expression. A CRTH2-associated condition or disorder may include a CRTH2-mediated condition or disorder.</p>As used herein, the phrases \u201cCRTH2-mediated condition or disorder,\u201d \u201ca condition or disorder mediated by CRTH2\u201d and related phrases and terms",

The plasmid was transfected into 293 cells, which normally express CRTH2, using LipofectAMINE\u2122 reagents (Gibco/BRL). G418 (800 mg/mL) was added to the culture 48 h after transfection and cells were maintained under selection for 3 weeks to ensure that all surviving cells stably expressed CRTH2. These cells are labeled as 293(124) hereafter.</p><sup>3</sup>H-PGD<sub>2 </sub>binding assay was performed using 293(124) cells. In brief, cells were washed and suspended in RPMI containing 0.5% BSA and 20 mM HEPES. Each assay contained 25,000 cells, appropriate amount of test compound when necessary and a mixture of 1 nM <sup>3</sup>H-PGD<sub>2 </sub>(Anmersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 30 nM of unlabeled PGD<sub>2 </sub>(Cayman Chemicals) in 200 mL final volume. The cell mixture was incubated at room temperature for 2.5 h with shaking and the cells were separated from free <sup>3</sup>H-PGD<sub>2 </sub>and transferred onto a filter plate using a cell harvester. Radioactivity bound to the cells was measured on a liquid scintillation counter. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 mM of unlabeled PGD<sub>2</sub>.</p>Modulation of CRTH2 and/or one or more other PGD<sub>2 </sub>receptors by test compounds can be assessed by other in vitro and in vivo assays. Examples of such assays include measuring second messenger (e.g., cAMP, IP<sub>3 </sub>or Ca<sup>2+</sup>) levels, ion flux, phosphorylation levels, transcription levels, and the like. Recombinant or naturally occurring CRTH2 polypeptides and/or other PGD<sub>2 </sub>receptor peptides can be used and the protein can be isolated, expressed in a cell, expressed in a membrane derived from a cell, expressed in tissue or in an animal. Signal transduction can also be examined in vitro with soluble or solid state reactions, using a chimeric molecule such as an extracellular domain of a receptor covalently linked to a heterologous signal transduction domain, or a heterologous extracellular domain covalently linked to the transmembrane and/or cytoplasmic domain of a receptor. Gene amplification can also be examined. Furthermore, ligand-binding domains of the protein of interest can be used in vitro in soluble or solid state reactions to assay for ligand binding.</p>CRTH2-G-protein or another PGD<sub>2 </sub>receptor-G-protein interactions can also be examined, by, for example, analysis of binding of the G-protein to the receptor or its release from the receptor.</p>Exemplary compounds of the invention displayed IC<sub>50 </sub>values as shown in Table I in the above-described ligand binding assay.</p>TABLE IExample of CRTH2 activity.Example #CRTH2 Binding IC501++2++3++4+5++10+++12+++17++18+++31+33++35+++36++63++64+++67+++70+++73+++75+++77+++ IC50 &gt; 15 \u03bcM++ 15 \u03bcM &gt; IC50 &gt; 1 \u03bcM+++ IC50 &lt; 1 \u03bcM</p>Example 96Cyclic AMP Assays on Human DP FunctionCyclic AMP assays on human DP function are performed using human platelets (AllCells, Berkeley, Calif.) and the 96-well Tropix cAMP ELISA System (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer's manual. Briefly, the human platelets rich plasma (PRP) is diluted 1:3 with human plasma and incubated with 1 mM of the phosphodiesterases inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX, Sigma) at 37\u00b0 C. for 20 min, to prevent hydrolysis of cAMP. 20 \u03bcl of the above PRP sample is mixed 1:1:1 with the test compound and PGD<sub>2 </sub>(both prepared in the assay buffer with DMSO concentration&lt;1%) in a 96-well plate. The assay buffer can be OPTI-free medium (Gibco BRL). After 20 min incubation at 37\u00b0 C., 20 \u03bcl of lysis buffer from the kit is added to each well of the mixture and the plate then incubated at room temperature for 10 min with moderate shaking and at 37\u00b0 C. for 10 min. After the cell lysis, 60 \u03bcl of the cell lysate together with 30 \u03bcl of diluted cAMP-AP conjugate and 60 \u03bcl anti-cAMP antibody is then transferred into a kit assay plate and the plate incubated at room temperature for 30 min with shaking. The plate is then washed with wash buffer and incubated with 100 \u03bcl per well of substrate/enhancer solution at room temperature for 60 min. Light signal intensity, which is inversely proportional to the cAMP level in each sample, is measured in a luminometer (CLIPR, Dynamic Devices). The final human plasma concentr"
