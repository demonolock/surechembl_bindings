LBS Binding Assay.</p>[LBS stands for Levetiracetam Binding Site cf. M. Noyer et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. (1995), 286, 137-146.] \n\n The inhibition constant (K<sub>j</sub>) of a compound is determined in competitive binding experiments by measuring the binding of a single concentration of a radioactive ligand at equilibrium with various concentrations of the unlabeled test substance. The concentration of the test substance inhibiting 50 % of the specific binding of the radioligand is called the ICSQ- The equilibrium dissociation constant Kj is proportional to the IC50 and is calculated using the equation of Cheng and Prusoff (Cheng Y. et al., Biochem. Pharmacol. (1972), 22, 3099-3108).</p>The concentration range usually encompasses 6 log units with variable steps (0.3 to 0.5 log). Assays are performed in mono- or duplicate, each Kj determination is performed on two different samples of test substance.</p>Cerebral cortex from 200-25Og male Sprague-Dawley rats are homogenised using a Potter S homogeniser (10 strokes at 1 ,000 rpm; Braun, Germany) in 20 mmol/l Tris-HCI (pH 7.4), 250 mmol/l sucrose (buffer A); all operations are performed at 4 <sup>0</sup>C. The homogenate is centrifuged at 30,000 g for 15 min. The crude membrane pellet obtained is resuspended in 50 mmol/l Tris-HCI (pH 7.4), (buffer B) and incubated 15 min at 37 <sup>0</sup>C, centrifuged at 30,000 g for 15 min and washed twice with the same buffer. The final pellet is resuspen-ded in buffer A at a protein concentration ranging from 15 to 25 mg/ml and stored in liquid nitrogen.</p>Membranes (150-200 \u03bcg of protein / assay) are incubated at 4 <sup>0</sup>C for 120 min in 0.5 ml of a 50 mmol/l Tris-HCI buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2 mmol/l MgCl2 , 1 to 2 10<sup>\"9</sup> mol/l of [<sup>3</sup>H]-2-</p>[4-(3-azidophenyl)-2-oxo-1-pyrrolidinyl]butanamide and increasing concentrations of the test compound of formula (I). The non specific binding (NSB) is defined as the residual binding observed in the presence of a concentration of reference substance (e.g. 10<sup>~</sup>3 mol/l le",
    "ma Sector husbandry unit since 1978, are used. The experimental design consisted of several groups, one group receiving the vehicle control and the other groups different doses of the test-compound. The compounds are administered intraperitoneal^ 60 minutes before the induction of audiogenic seizures. The range of the doses administered had a logarithmic progression, generally between 1.O x 10<sup>~</sup>5 mol/kg and 1.0 x 10<sup>~</sup>3 mol/kg, but lower or higher doses are tested if necessary.</p>For testing, the animals are placed in small cages, one mouse per cage, in a sound- attenuated chamber. After a period of orientation of 30 seconds, the acoustic stimulus (90 dB, 10-20 kHz) is delivered for 30 seconds via loudspeakers positioned above each cage. During this interval, the mice are observed and the presence of the 3 phases of the seizure activity namely wild running, clonic and tonic convulsions, is recorded. The proportion of mice protected against wild running, clonic and tonic convulsions, respectively, is calculated. For active compounds, an ED50 value, i.e. the dose producing 50 % protection relative to the control group, together with 95 % confidence limits, is calculated using a Probit Analysis (SAS/STAT\u00ae Software, version 6.09, PROBIT procedure) of the proportions of protected mice for each of the 3 phases of the seizure activity.</p>Compounds synthesized according to the procedure described in examples 1 to 33 and described in table 1 are tested in the SV2 binding assay and/or audiogenic seizure in mice, according to the procedure described above, and are found active. \n</p>"
