    "4 blocker (GSK2193874) inhibited PDAC growth (FIG. 34A) and reduced pro- metastatic factor SAA in serum (FIG. 34B). Tumor growth and serum SAA were measured 20 days after transplantation of KPCY cells into the pancreas, as described in FIG. 33. Mice were treated with GSK2193874 (20 mg/mL) dissolved in 6% cavitron saline buffer and 100 pL drug solution was loaded in an osmotic minipump implanted subcutaneously for 20 days. </p>FIG. 35A-E show that the genetic deletion of TRPV4 reduces pancreatic cancer growth and pro- metastatic factors. KPCY cells were injected into the pancreas of wild-type or TRPV4 KO mice, which were analyzed 20 days later. FIG. 35A shows pancreatic tumor images from wild-type and TRPV4 KO mice. The results show that tumor weight (FIG. 35B), serum IL-6 levels (FIG. 35C), and liver serum amyloid a1 and a2 expression (FIG. 35D-E) were elevated in wildtype mice, but not in TRPV4 KO mice. </p>FIG. 36A-E show that TRPV4 KO mice exhibit reduced metastatic liver colonization. KPC cells were injected into the tail region of the mouse pancreas to initiate PDAC. Ten days later, these PDAC mice were intrasplenically injected with KPCY cells, and the liver was analyzed after ten days. FIG. 36A shows images of the liver showing metastatic tumor lesions in WT mice (areas are marked with a dotted yellow circle). Metastatic tumor lesions were not seen in TRPV4 KO mice. Scale bar = 10 mm. FIG. 36B-C show microscopic images of the liver stained for the proliferation marker Ki-67 (magenta) (FIG. 36B) and colonization of KPCY cancer cells (green) (FIG. 36C). Nuclei stained with Nunc blue. Scale bar for FIG. 36B is 100 pm and for FIG. 36C is 50 pm. FIG. 36D shows a graph of Ki67+ cells in WT and TRPV4 KO mice. FIG. 36E shows a graph of the number of lesions in WT and TRPV4 KO mice. </p>FIG. 37A-B show prophetic experimental designs to study the effects of Piezol and TRPV4 in a genetically engineered KPC (KrasLSL-G12D; p53LoxP; Pdx1-CreER) mouse model of PDAC. FIG. 37A shows that tamoxifen (100 mg/kg/day for five days) are injected intraperitoneally to KPC, KPC-Piezo1<sup>GFAP</sup>-KO, and KPC-TRPV4 KO mice to induce pancreatic tumor development. 8-10 weeks after tamoxifen (around 80 days), the mice should develop pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) or precursors lesions. FIG. 37A shows that on days \n\n80, 100, and 120 after tamoxifen, the liver and pancreas tissue are processed for microscopic imaging and quantification of mRNA levels. Serum samples are used to quantify pro- metastatic factors as depicted in the model. FIG. 37B shows that tamoxifen is injected intraperitoneally to KPC mice. One group of mice is administered a TRPV4 blocker via an infusion osmotic minipump (ALZET) implanted subcutaneously on day 100 for 20 days and another group of mice are used as a control without TRPV4 blocker. On days 80, 100, and 120 after tamoxifen, the liver and pancreas tissue are processed for microscopic imaging and quantification of mRNA levels.",
    "method for assessing metastatic factors is achieved by injecting fluorescently labeled KPCY cells into the spleen. Detection of fluorescent KCPY cells in the liver is indicative of the efficiency of the spread of KPCY cells and would be an indicator of a pro-metastatic condition. This approach should allow for the assessment of the effects of PDL on metastasis independent of orthotopically \n\ntransplanted KPC cells. Together, these studies should allow for the determination if high intrapancreatic pressure can trigger the formation of the pro-metastasis niche in the liver mediated by Piezol activation in pancreatic stellate cells. mRNA levels of IL-6, IL-8, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), MMPs, and TIMP1 are measured from pancreas tissues, and the hepatocyte-derived factors SAA1 , SAA2, and hepatocyte growth factor-like protein (HGFL) are measured in liver tissue from wildtype, Piezo1<sup>GFAP</sup>- KO, and TRPV4 KO mice. Male and female mice are analyzed separately and combined. Pro-metastatic factors are quantified in serum and liver and pancreas tissue will be processed for microscopic and transcriptional analysis. An important mechanism by which IL- 6 is believed to induce the liver pro-metastatic niche is through the activation of STAT3 in hepatocytes. Therefore, P-STAT3 levels will also be quantified in hepatic tissues by western blot. Quantitative analysis of KPCY cells and proliferation of tumors in the liver are determined by immunostaining using EYFP and Ki-67 antibodies, respectively. Masson\u2019s trichrome staining will be used to quantify collagen deposition surrounding tumors in the liver. Macrophage recruitment surrounding the tumor is assayed using CD68, F4/80 antibodies. This study should establish whether intrapancreatic pancreatic pressure or stiffness contributes to the liver pro-metastatic niche and pancreatic cancer metastases through Piezol or TRPV4 activation in stellate cells. </p>Effects of TRPV4 Inhibition on Pancreatic Cancer Growth, Metastasis, and Mouse Survival in an Orthotopic Transplantation Model of PDAC </p>This study determines if a pharmacological inhibitor of Piezol signaling can be used to treat pancreatic cancer. Using the experimental approaches as described herein, it will be determined whether TRPV4 mediates pressure-activated PSC activation and generation of pro- metastatic factors IL-6, LIF, G-CSF, IL-11 , IL-1 , and MMPs. Experiments are performed in wildtype mice with orthotopic KPCY cell transplantation and orthotopically transplanted mice treated with the TRPV4 antagonists, GSK2798745 or GSK2193874 (FIG. 33). </p>The effects of pharmacological TRPV4 inhibition are compared to orthotopic transplantation studies conducted in TRPV4 KO mice. Notably, transplanted cancer cells are not deficient in TRPV4, and therefore, the effects of pharmacological TRPV4 blockade may have additional effects to those observed in TRPV4 KO mice. Cancer metastases to the liver are assessed by measuring liver volume,"
