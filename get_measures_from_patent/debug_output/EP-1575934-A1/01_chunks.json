    "Y5 antagonists using a calcium fluorescence assay.</p>\n  The coding sequence for human Y5 receptor h NPY-Y5 receptor cDNA is cloned using standard cloning techniques (Ref: Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Edition, J. Sambrook, E. F. Fritsch, T. Maniatis; Cold Spring Habor Laboratory Press; Cold Spring Habor, NY, 1989) and is subcloned into a novel mammalian expression vector called pM<sup>2</sup> (Ref: B.S. Sachais et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1998, 266:2319-2322). This expression vector has a Harvey murine sarcoma virus long terminal repeat to drive expression of the Y5 structural gene. This plasmid construct is used along with calcium phosphates to stably transfect human Bowes melanoma cells (HMCB; obtained from ATCC, Rockville, MD), a cell line in which several GDi-linked receptors are expressed at reasonable levels and are coupled to functional responses. Cells are maintained at 37\u00b0C and 5% C0<sub>2</sub> in Eagle's minimum essential medium with 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 1.0 mM sodium pyruvate and 25 mM HEPES which is supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (pH 7.3). This cell host exhibits low levels of Y1 responses and sites, and no other NPY- induced responses. The Y1 antagonist BIBP3226 (Research Biochemicals International, Natick, MA) at 10 uM completely blocks the endogenous NPY response. A single clonal cell line is isolated and characterized with the agonist peptide NPY. In the presence of 10 uM BIBP3226, NPY stimulated calcium mobilization with an EC50 from 9 nM to 54 nM in ten independent studies.</p>\n  Cells are plated onto 96 well plates at 30,000 cells / well for twenty-four hours. The cells are rinsed with buffered saline (consisting of: 115 mM NaCI, 0.96 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM MgS0<sub>4</sub>, 25 mM HEPES, 2 mM CaCI<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM KCI, 5 mM Glucose, 1 mM Probenecid) and incubated for 1.5 hrs. in the fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator Fluo-3 AM (10 \u03bcM, Teflabs, Austin, TX) made in the same \n\n buffered saline. Cells are rinsed twice with buffer supplemented with 1 mM carbachol and 10 \u03bcM BIBP3226. NPY applied to HMCB Y5 cells produce a concentration dependent increase in intracellular calcium as determined by an increase in fluorescence read on a Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The concentration of NPY used in these experiments is between the EC<sub>3</sub>o and EC<sub>50</sub> as determined just prior to each experiment. Fluorescence increase in response to NPY in the presence of test compounds was compared to control responses in the same plate and the IC<sub>50</sub> for each compound is determined by a fit of the data to the logistic equation (Kaleidograph software, Reading PA).</p>\n  PYY3-36 Induced GTP\u03c4?<sup>5</sup>S Binding at Human NPY Y5 Receptors Co- Expressed With G\u03b1O.
