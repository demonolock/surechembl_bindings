All other abbreviations used in Table 4 above are as defined before.\n</p>Pharmacological Part1) Menin/MLL Homogenous Time-Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF) AssayTo an untreated, white 384-well microtiter plate was added 40 nL 200\u00d7 test compound in DMSO and 4 \u03bcL 2\u00d7 terbium chelate-labeled menin (vide infra for preparation) in assay buffer (40 mM Tris\u00b7HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT (dithiothreitol) and 0.05% Pluronic F-127). After incubation of test compound and terbium chelate-labeled menin for 30 min at ambient temperature, 4 \u03bcL 2\u00d7FITC-MBM1 peptide (FITC-\u03b2-alanine-SARWRFPARPGT-NH<sub>2</sub>) (\u201cFITC\u201d means fluorescein isothiocyanate) in assay buffer was added, the microtiter plate centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 min and the assay mixtures incubated for 15 min at ambient temperature. The relative amount of menin.FITC-MBM1 complex present in an assay mixture is determined by measuring the homogenous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) of the terbium/FITC donor/acceptor fluorophore pair using an EnVision microplate reader (ex. 337 nm/terbium em. 490 nm/FITC em. 520 nm) at ambient temperature. The degree of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (the HTRF value) is expressed as the ratio of the fluorescence emission intensities of the FITC and terbium fluorophores (F<sup>em </sup>520 nm/F<sup>em </sup>490 nm). The final concentrations of reagents in the binding assay are 200 pM terbium chelate-labeled menin, 75 nM FITC-MBM1 peptide and 0.5% DMSO in assay buffer. Dose-response titrations of test compounds are conducted using an 11 point, four-fold serial dilution scheme, starting typically at 10 \u03bcM.</p>Compound potencies were determined by first calculating % inhibition at each compound concentration according to equation 1:</p>%\u2062   inhibition=((HC-LC)-(HTRFcompound-LC))/(HC-LC))*100(Eqn\u2062   1)</p>where LC and HC are the HTRF values of the assay in the presence or absence of a saturating concentration of a compound that competes with FITC-MBM1 for binding to menin, and HTRF<sup>compound </sup>is the measured HTRF value in the presence of the test compound. HC and LC HTRF values represent an average of at least 10 replicates per plate. For each test compound, % inhibition values were plotted vs. the logarithm of the test compound concentration, and the IC<sub>50 </sub>value derived from fitting these data to equation 2:</p>%\u2062   inhibition=Bottom+(Top-Bottom)/(1+10^((log\u2062IC50-log[cmpd])*h))(Eqn\u2062   2)</p>where Bottom and Top are the lower and upper asymptotes of the dose-response curve, respectively, IC<sub>50 </sub>is the concentration of compound that yields 50% inhibition of signal and h is the Hill coefficient.</p>Preparation of Terbium cryptate labeling of Menin: Menin (a.a 1-610-6\u00d7his tag, 2.3 mg/mL in 20 mM Hepes (2-[4-(2-Hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethane sulfonic acid), 80 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT (Dithiothreitol), pH 7.5) was labeled with terbium cryptate as follows. 200 \u03bcg of Menin was buffer exchanged into 1\u00d7 Hepes buffer. 6.67 \u03bcM Menin was incubated with 8-fold molar excess NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide)-terbium cryptate for 40 minutes at room temperature. Half of the labeled protein was purified away from free label by running the reaction over a NAPS column with elution buffer (0.1M Hepes, pH 7+0.1% BSA (bovine serum albumin)). The other half was eluted with 0.1M phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH7. 400 \u03bcl of eluent was collected for each, aliquoted and frozen at \u221280\u00b0 C. The final concentration of terbium-labeled Menin protein was 115 \u03bcg/mL in Hepes buffer and 85 \u03bcg/mL in PBS buffer, respectively.</p>MENIN\u2003Protein\u2003Sequence\u2003(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u20031):MGLKAAQKTLFPLRSIDDVVRLFAAELGREEPDLVLLSLVLGFVEHFLAVNRV IPTNVPELTFQPSPAPDPPGGLTYFPVADLSIIAALYARFTAQIRGAVDLSLYPREGGVS SRELVKKVSDVIWNSLSRSYFKDRAHIQSLFSFITGTKLDSSGVAFAVVGACQALGLR DVHLALSEDHAWVVFGPNGEQTAEVTWHGKGNEDRRGQTVNAGVAERSWLYLKG SYMRCDRKMEVAFMVCAINPSIDLHTDSLELLQLQQKLLWLLYDLGHLERYPMALG NLADLEELEPTPGRPDPLTL",
    "solution contained (in mM) 120 KCl, 10 EGTA (Ethylene glycol-bis(2-aninoethylether)-N,N,N\u2032,N-tetraacetic acid), 10 HEPES, 5.374 CaCl<sub>2 </sub>and 1.75 MgCl<sub>2 </sub>(pH 7.2 with KOH).</p>Patch-clamp experiments were performed in the voltage-clamp mode and whole-cell currents were recorded with an automated patch-clamp assay utilizing the QPatch system (Sophion). Current signals were amplified and digitized, stored and analyzed by using the QPatch assay software.</p>The holding potential was \u221280 mV. The hERG current (K<sup>+</sup>-selective outward current) was determined as the maximal tail current at \u221240 mV after a 2 second depolarization to +60 mV. Pulse cycling rate was 15 s. A short pulse (90 ms) to \u221240 mV served as a baseline step to calculate the tail current amplitude. After establishing whole-cell configuration and a stability period, the solvent control (0.3% DMSO) was applied for 5 minutes followed by the test substance by four increasing concentrations of 3\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, 3\u00d710<sup>\u22126 </sup>M, 10<sup>\u22125 </sup>M and 3\u00d710<sup>\u22125 </sup>M. Each concentration of the test substance was applied twice. The effect of each concentration was determined after 5 min as an average current of 3 sequential voltage pulses. To determine the extent of block the residual current was compared with vehicle pre-treatment.</p>Concentration/response relations were calculated by non-linear least-squares fits to the individual data points. The half-maximal inhibiting concentration (IC50) was calculated by the fitting routine.</p>Protocol 2:CellsThe compound, vehicle control and positive control were tested on hERG-transfected HEK293 cells. A human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293) with a stable transfection of hERG (Zhou Z et al. Biophysical Journal 1998. 74, 230-241; McDonald T. V. et al, Nature 1997. 388, 289-292) was used (University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA). The cells were kept in culture in MEM (Minimum Essential Medium, Gibco) which was supplemented with (amounts indicated added to 500 ml MEM): 5 ml L-Glutamine-Penicillin-Streptomycin (Sigma), 50 ml Fetal Bovine serum (Bio-Whittaker), 5 ml Non-essential Amino Acids 100\u00d7 (Gibco), 5 mil sodium pyruvate 100 mM (Gibco) and 4 ml geneticin 50 mg/ml (Gibco) using T175 flasks. The cells were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. in 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere (in air).</p>Cell Harvesting for AssayCells were harvested as described below using Accumax\u2122 (Sigma) as the dissociating reagent. Cells were then resuspended in a mixture of 33% DMEM/F12 (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium/Nutrient Mixture F-12\u2014Sigma) media/67% extracellular physiological solution.</p>The flasks were washed twice carefully with \u02dc5-10 ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Gibco\u2122) containing 2 mM EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) (Sigma). The cells were dissociated using \u02dc3 ml of Accumax\u2122 (cell detachment solution) and incubated for \u02dc5 to 10 min. at 37\u00b0 C. Cold external physiological solution (2-5 ml) was added and the flasks are incubated at \u02dc4\u00b0"
