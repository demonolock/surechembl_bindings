Crude scFv containing periplasmic extracts were screened for the ability to inhibit the binding of bio.IL-22 H/F to a human IL-22 receptor protein (hIL-22R). Output colonies from selections were picked into 96 well plates containing 100 \u00b5l 2TYAG. ScFv production was induced by addition of 1 mM IPTG to exponentially growing cultures and overnight incubation at 30\u00b0C. Periplasmic extracts were prepared (Griffiths et al., 1993) in 50 mM MOPS pH 7.4/ 0.5 mM EDTA / 0.5M Sorbitol.</p>Microtiter plates were coated with 1.25 \u00b5g/ml of an IL-22 receptor protein antibody (in PBS) for 1.5 hours at room temperature. Plates were then washed three times in PBS, and blocked for 1 hour at room temperature with PBS containing 2% milk powder (2% MPBS). After a further 3 washes, 50 \u00b5l of 25% cell conditioned medium containing IL-22 receptor protein was added to each well, and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. The following day, 25 \u00b5l of sample and 25\u00b5l of bio.IL-22 H/F (54 ng/ml in PBS/0.05% BSA/0.05% Tween) were added to the washed plates, and incubated for 1.5 hours at room temperature. After 3 washes in PBST, binding of bio.IL-22 H/F was detected with Europium-Streptavidin and TRF detected with the DELFIA\u00ae reagent kit and Victor 2\u2122 Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer).</p>Clones that showed inhibition of IL-22 binding were retested as purified scFv. Both the IL-22/IL-22R binding assay (described above) arid the IL-22 / IL-22 receptor complex assay (described below) were used. ScFv concentrations were titrated in order to establish the clone potencies as measured by assay IC<sub>50</sub> values.

The dissociation phase was monitored in HBS/EP buffer for 10 minutes at the same flow rate followed by a 5 \u00b5l injection of 0.1% TFA and a 5 \u00b5l injection of glycine pH 1.5 to regenerate a fully active capturing surface.</p>For 356A11 and 368D04, solutions of human IL-22 at 400, 200, 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25 and 0 nM were injected in triplicates at a flow rate of 100 \u00b5l per minute (high flow to avoid non specific binding) for 3 minutes, and the amount of bound material as a function of time was recorded as sensorgrams. The dissociation phase was monitored in HBS/EP buffer for 60 minutes at the same flow rate followed by two 5 \u00b5l injections of glycine pH 1.5 to regenerate a fully active capturing surface.</p>All kinetic experiments were done at 22.5\u00baC in HBS/EP buffer. Blank and buffer effects were subtracted for each sensorgram using double referencing. In control experiments the first injection contained buffer.</p>The kinetic data were analyzed using BIAevaluation software 3.0.2 applied to a 1:1 model. The apparent dissociation (K<sub>d</sub>) and association (K<sub>a</sub>) rate constants were calculated from the appropriate regions of the sensorgrams using a global analysis. The affinity constants of the interaction between antibody and analyte were calculated from the kinetic rate constants by the following formulae: K<sub>D</sub> = K<sub>d</sub> / K<sub>a</sub>, where K<sub>D</sub> is the dissociation constant, and K<sub>A</sub> = K<sub>a</sub>/K<sub>d</sub>, where K<sub>A</sub> is the association constant.
