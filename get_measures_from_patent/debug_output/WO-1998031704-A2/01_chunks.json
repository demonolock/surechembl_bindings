    "of 21-23\u00b0C (bath temperature 20-22\u00b0C). The whole is stirred for 5-10 minutes and 140 ml of glacial acetic acid are added over a period of 20- 25 minutes while maintaining an internal temperature 20-23\u00b0C (bath temperature 16-18\u00b0C) with stirring. The solid is collected by filtration over a polypropylene pad filter in a Buchner funnel with suction and washed with 3 x 400ml water. The solid is dried at 50-52\u00b0C (60-65 torr) to obtain a constant weight (24h) of the title compound as a white solid (rf = 0.69 in ethyl acetate).</p>Compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts, hereinafter referred to collectively as \"AGENTS OF THE INVENTION\", exhibit tachykinin antagonist activity. More particularly AGENTS OF THE INVENTION exhibit potent antagonist activity at the NK-1 tachykinin (substance P) receptor. AGENTS OF THE INVENTION are accordingly useful as pharmaceuticals, e.g. as hereinafter further set forth.</p>TEST I: BINDING AFFINITY</p>Binding affinity for the NK-1 receptor may be demonstrated by ability to displace [3H]-substance P binding, e.g. as indicated in TEST I. Displacement of r<sup>3</sup>H1-substance P binding from mebranes from Cos-7 cells transfected with cloned human NK-1 receptor (hNK-IR) described in the aforementioned International Patent Publication no. WO 96/18643 at pages 25 through 27.</p>AGENTS OF THE INVENTION are active in displacing [<sup>3</sup>H] Substance P in the said test method at concentrations of the order of from Ki = about 0.01 to about 10.0 nM. \n\nPharmacological, e.g. analgesic, utility of AGENTS OF THE INVENTION as NK-1 receptor antagonists can also be demonstrated in accordance with standard test models for example as follows:</p>TEST II: HYPERALGESIA MODEL</p>The test is performed as described for TEST II in the aforementioned International Patent Publication no. WO 96/18643 at page 28.</p>AGENTS OF THE INVENTION are found to be active in reducing mechanical hyperalgesia in the said test model at dosages of the order of from 0.1 to about 5.0 mg/kg p.o..</p>TEST III: NEUROPATHIC HYPERALGESIA MODEL</p>Guinea pigs are anaesthetised with enflurane in N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>:O<sub>2</sub> (1:1) and peripheral nerve damage is induced by partial ligation of one sciatic nerve. Following recovery from surgery, ligated animals demonstrate clear mechanical hyperalgesia measured, as in the case of TEST II employing a Vigo Basile Analgesy meter which develops within 5 days and persists for over 29 days. Groups of 6 animals receive test compound p.o. in the form of a microemulsion compsition as hereinafter described at varying dose, or placebo, 11 to 15 days following ligation. Hyperalgesia in groups receiving test compound or placebo is compared and data presented as mean \u00b1 S.E.M. and analysed using ANOVA followed by Turkey's HSD test.</p>AGENTS OF THE INVENTION inhibit mechanical hyperalgesia associated with peripheral nerve ligation in the above test model at doses of the order of from 0"
