    "colonies are isolated after 2-3 weeks of growth using the cloning ring method and subsequently expanded into clonal cell lines. </p> 5.2 Prostanoid Receptor Binding Assays </p> HEK 293(ebna) cells or other cells stably transfected with the appropriate receptor are maintained in culture, harvested and membranes are prepared by differential centrifugation, following lysis of the cells in the presence of protease inhibitors, for use in receptor binding assays. </p> Prostanoid receptor binding assays are performed in 10 mM MES/KOH (pH 6.0) (EPs, FP and TP) or 10 mM HEPES/KOH (pH 7.4) (DP and IP), containing 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM divalent cation and the appropriate radioligand for the given receptor. The reaction is initiated by addition of membrane protein. Typically, the ligands are added in a solvent such as dimethylsulfoxide which is kept constant at 1% (v/v) in all incubations. Non-specific binding is determined in the presence of 1 \u03bcM of the corresponding non-radioactive prostanoid. Incubations are conducted for 60 min at room temperature or 30\u00b0 C. and terminated by rapid filtration. Specific binding is calculated by subtracting non-specific binding from total binding. The residual specific binding at each ligand concentration is calculated and expressed as a function of ligand concentration in order to construct sigmoidal concentration-response curves for determination of ligand affinity. </p> In another protocol, compounds of the invention are tested in DP<sub>1 </sub>receptor binding assay of the following protocol. A mixture containing 20 \u03bcg of DP<sub>1 </sub>receptor membranes, 0.5 mg of wheat germ agglutinin coated PVT-SPA beads, plus or minus a test compound of the invention (25 \u03bcl per well) or 10 \u03bcM of cold PGE2 at 1% DMSO and 20 nM radiolabeled ligand for the receptor (e.g., tritiated-PGE2) in assay buffer containing 25 mM MES, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EDTA, pH 6.0 are incubated in Corning 3600 plates on a plate shaker for 2 hrs at room temperature. Binding of the radiolabeled ligand binding is evaluated by counting the plates on the top count using the 3H SPA dpm2 program. % Binding and Ki value for inhibitors are calculated based on the one site competition parameter using the Graphpad\u00ae prism program. Such an assay may be modified by employing the different receptors and their specific ligands to assess the activity of the compounds of the present invention against such receptors. Using such an assay, the DP<sub>1 </sub>Ki values for a number of exemplary compounds of the present invention were calculated and are shown in Table 1. As can be seen from the Table below, a comparison of the Ki values against DP<sub>1 </sub>as compared to Ki values of these compounds against DP<sub>2</sub>, shows that exemplary agonists of the present invention are specific for DP<sub>1 </sub>as compared to these other prostaglandin receptors (K<sub>i </sub>values for h-EP<sub>2</sub>, h-EP<sub>3 </sub>and h-EP<sub>4 </sub>of &gt;10000 nM).  \nTABLE 1Inhibition of DP<sub>1</sub>h-DP<sub>2 </sub>K<sub>i</sub>h-DP<sub>1 </sub>K<sub>i</sub>h-DP<sub>1 </sub>EC<sub>50</sub>(nM)Example #(nM)(nM)n = 2PGD24.10.3BW245C0.03112.40.00072&gt;10000210.50.71&gt;1000031.80.037&gt;10000447.21.38&gt;10000\n</p> 5.3 Whole Cell Second Messenger Assays </p> Whole cell second messenger assays measuring stimulation (EP<sub>2</sub>, EP<sub>4</sub>, DP<sub>1</sub>, DP<sub>2 </sub>and IP in HEK 293(ebna) cells) or inhibition (EP<sub>3 </sub>in human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells) of intracellular cAMP accumulation or mobilization of intracellular calcium (EP<sub>1</sub>, FP and TP in HEK 293(ebna) cells stably transfected with apo-aequorin) are performed to determine whether receptor ligands are agonists or antagonists. For cAMP assays, cells are harvested and resuspended in HBSS containing 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. Incubations contain 100 \u03bcM RO-20174 (phosphodiesterase type IV inhibitor, available from Biomol) and, in the case of the EP<sub>3 </sub>inhibition assay only, 15 \u03bcM forskolin to stimulate cAMP production. </p> Samples are incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 10 min, the reaction is terminated and cAMP levels are then measured. For calcium mobilization assays, cells are charged with the co-factors reduced glutathione and coelenterazine, harvested and resuspended in Ham's F12 medium. Calcium mobilization is measured by monitoring luminescence provoked by calcium binding to the intracellular photoprotein aequorin. Ligands are added in dimethylsulfoxide which is kept constant at 1% (v/v) in all incubations. </p> For agonists, second messenger responses are expressed as a function of ligand concentration and both EC50 values and the maximum response as compared to a prostanoid standard are calculated. For antagonists, the ability of a ligand to inhibit an agonist response is determined by Schild analysis and both KB and slope values are calculated. </p> In another exemplary protocol, HEK293-EBNA cells transfected with the appropriate receptors are seeded in 96 well opaque plate (Costar #3917) at 4\u00d710<sup>4 </sup>cells per well in 100 \u03bcl of culture medium (D-MEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 nM L-glutamine, and 250 \u03bcg/ml of hygromycin; all from GibcoBRL) and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. After overnight incubation, the medium was removed from each well and replaced with 45 \u03bcl of assay medium consisted of phenol red free D-MEM/F-12, 0.1% BSA (GibcoBRL) and 0.1 mM 3 isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine (Sigma). After 15 minutes of incubation at 37\u00b0 C., 16-16-dimethyl PGE-2 or compounds at desired concentrations in 20 \u03bcl of assay medium were added to cells and further incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 hour. Total cAMP (intra- and extracellular) was measured by using a cAMP-screen ELISA System (Tropix #CS1000). </p> 5.4 In Vivo Ovulation Assay </p> Ovulation triggering activity of compounds of the invention are tested in a mature mouse ovulation induction model.

Data also may be obtained for reference compounds (sulprostone and butaprost) that do not fulfill the selection criteria for DP<sub>1 </sub>agonists in order to provide a comparison of activity. </p> In exemplary embodiments, oral activity in the in vivo model of ovulation induction is evaluated for other compounds of the invention at the single dose of 20 mg/kg. </p> It is desirable that the compounds of the invention are able to stimulate ovulation induction in mature mice in at least one of the routes of administration.
