    "p>Western blotting method.</p>1. Protein sample preparation: the mouse brain cortex tissue was added with RIPA lysate (strong) (main component 20mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100), sonicated cells, at 4 \u2103,12000 g, centrifuged for 15 min, and the supernatant was transferred to a new centrifuge tube.</p>2. Protein concentration determination: after the protein was left in an incubator at 37\u2103for 30 min, absorbance was measured by an enzyme-labeled instrument at 570 nm.</p>3. Electrophoresis: according to the molecular weight of the run protein, preparing gel with corresponding concentration, and adding the prepared brain tissue or human astrocyte sample. And (3) running glue at the voltage of 90V, and transferring the film after the glue running is finished, wherein the film transferring condition is 200 mA for 90 min.</p>4. Immune response: after the transfer, the PVDF membrane was transferred to a dish with a blocking solution (5% skim milk) and blocked 1 h on a shaker at room temperature. The primary antibody was diluted with 1% BSA, placed in a membrane-sealed hybridization bag, sealed with air bubbles removed, and transferred to a shaking table at 3 h or 4\u2103overnight. TBST is washed for 3 times, each time for 10 min, fluorescent secondary antibody is added, and the membrane is turned into 1 h at room temperature. The TBST film was washed 3 times for 10 min each. Developed with an Odyssey infrared fluorescence scanning imaging system.</p>Example 1</p>FIG. 1 shows half maximal Inhibitory Concentration (IC) of trifluothiaton <sub>50</sub> ) Human astrocytes were treated with different concentrations of trifluoracene for 24 hours and then the absorbance of the cells at 450nm was measured using the CCK-8 method, IC <sub>50</sub> = 9.363 \u03bcm. The specific experimental process comprises the following steps: after cell counting, 10 per well <sup>3</sup> Individual cells were seeded in 96-well plates, 100 \u03bcl per well; after the cells are attached, the trifluoro thioxanthene is diluted into different concentrations by normal saline, 5 compound holes are formed in each group, and the cell proliferation detection is carried out after 24 hours of action; after adding 10. Mu.l of CCK-8 solution per well and incubating for 2 hours at 37\u2103the absorbance at 450nm was measured by a microplate reader. Calculating the inhibition rate of each group of cells, taking the concentration of the medicine as an abscissa and the inhibition rate as an ordinate,the drug concentration at which 50% inhibition was achieved was IC <sub>50</sub> \u3002</p>Example two</p>Effects of trifluothioxanthene on ischemic stroke. Male C57 mice were randomized into control (sham), model (I/R), dosing (I/R+trifluoracene) groups of 10. A transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model (tMCAO) was obtained from mice by the wire-plug method. Reperfusion was performed 60 min after ischemia, and immediately, as a single administration, trifluoraceton (20 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally"
