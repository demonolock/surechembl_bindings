    "d through the use of computer modeling using a docking program. Docking programs are known; for example GRAM, DOCK or AUTODOCK (see Walters et al. Drug Discovery Today, vol. 3, no. 4 (1998), 160-178, and Dunbrack et al. Folding and Design 2 (1997), 27-42). This procedure can include computer fitting of potential binders ascertain how well the shape and the chemical structure of the potential binder will bind to a CRISPR-Cas9 system (e.g., <i>S. pyogenes </i>Cas9). Computer-assisted, manual examination of the active site or binding site of a CRISPR-Cas9 system (e.g., <i>S. pyogenes </i>Cas9) may be performed. Programs such as GRID (P. Goodford, J. Med. Chem, 1985, 28, 849-57)\u2014a program that determines probable interaction sites between molecules with various functional groups\u2014may also be used to analyze the active site or binding site to predict partial structures of binding compounds. Computer programs can be employed to estimate the attraction, repulsion or steric hindrance of the two binding partners, e.g., CRISPR-Cas9 system (e.g., <i>S. pyogenes </i>Cas9) and a candidate nucleic acid molecule or a nucleic acid molecule and a candidate CRISPR-Cas9 system (e.g., <i>S. pyogenes </i>Cas9); and the CRISPR-Cas9 crystral structure (<i>S. pyogenes </i>Cas9) herewith enables such methods. Generally, the tighter the fit, the fewer the steric hindrances, and the greater the attractive forces, the more potent the potential binder, since these properties are consistent with a tighter binding constant. Furthermore, the more specificity in the design of a candidate CRISPR-Cas9 system (e.g., <i>S. pyogenes </i>Cas9), the more likely it is that it will not interact with off-target molecules as well. Also, \u201cwet\u201d methods are enabled by the instant invention. For example, in an aspect, the invention provides for a method for determining the structure of a binder (e.g., target nucleic acid molecule) of a candidate CRISPR-Cas9 system (e.g., <i>S. pyogenes </i>Cas9) bound to the candidate CRISPR-Cas9 system (e.g., <i>S. pyogenes </i>Cas9), said method comprising, (a) providing a first crystal of a candidate CRISPR-Cas9 system (<i>S. pyogenes </i>Cas9) according to the invention or a second crystal of a candidate a candidate CRISPR-Cas9 system (e.g., <i>S. pyogenes </i>Cas9), (b) contacting the first crystal or second crystal with said binder under conditions whereby a complex may form; and (c) determining the structure of said a candidate (e.g., CRISPR-Cas9 system (e.g., <i>S. pyogenes </i>Cas9) or CRISPR-Cas9 system (<i>S. pyogenes </i>Cas9) complex. The second crystal may have essentially the same coordinates discussed herein, however due to minor alterations in CRISPR-Cas9 system (e.g., from the Cas9 of such a system being e.g., <i>S. pyogenes </i>Cas9 versus being <i>S. pyogenes </i>Cas9), wherein \u201ce.g., <i>S. pyogenes </i>Cas9\u201d indicates that the Cas9 is a Cas9 and can be of or derived from <i>S. pyogenes </i>or an ortholog thereof), the crystal may form in a "
