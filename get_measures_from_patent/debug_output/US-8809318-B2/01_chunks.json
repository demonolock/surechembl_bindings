    "th water (1\u00d74 L), and brine (1\u00d72 L). The combined organic layers were dried over MgSO<sub>4</sub>, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo to afford X2 (344g, 97%) as yellow needles. <sup>1</sup>HNMR (CDCl<sub>3</sub>, 400 MHz) \u03b4 7.80 (d, 1H), 7.73 (d, 1H), 7.66 (dd, 1H), 3.99 (s, 3H), 3.94 (s, 3H).</p>Compound X3:</p>To a 2 L Parr bottle containing a mixture of X2 (95 g, 0.45 mol) in MeOH (anhydrous, 1.3 L) under nitrogen was added (Raney nickel slurry in water (15 ml) exchanged with methanol 3 times). The reaction mixture was hydrogenated in a Parr shaker at 45 psi overnight. The reaction sat for 30 min. The top layer of the reaction mixture was decanted and filtered. The residue was diluted with DCM (1 L), swirled for 5 min., and filtered resulting in X3 (&gt;quantitative) as an off-white solid. <sup>1</sup>HNMR (CDCl<sub>3</sub>, 400 MHz) \u03b4 7.52 (dd, 1H), 7.43 (d, 1H), 6.63 (d, 1H), 4.21 (s, 2H), 3.88 (s, 3H), 3.84 (s, 3H).</p>Compound X4:</p>To a 12 L 3-necked round bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, addition funnel, nitrogen inlet, and containing a suspension of X3 (252 g, 1.39 mol) in water (3.5 L) at 0\u00b0 C. was added H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>(20% vol., 700 mL). A solution of NaNO<sub>2 </sub>(105.6 g, 1.53 mol) in water (550 mL) was added slowly over 1 h at 0\u00b0 C. to 3\u00b0 C. and the reaction mixture was stirred further for 1 h. Next, urea (25 g, 0.417 mol) was added to the reaction mixture portionwise and stirred for 15 min. Then a solution of KI (242.3 g, 1.46 mol) in water (600 mL) was added to the 0\u00b0 C. reaction mixture over 30 min. The reaction mixture was then heated at 55\u00b0 C. for 1.5 h. Next, ethyl acetate (4 L) was used to dissolve the reaction mixture and the resulting solution was poured slowly into a solution of Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>(650g) in ice water (4 L) and the flask was rinsed with ethyl acetate (2 L) and stirred for 15 min. The resulting layers were separated and the aqueous phase (pH\u02dc3) was extracted with ethyl acetate (2 L). The combined organic layers were washed with water (2 L\u00d72), brine (1 L), dried over Mg<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The crude material was purified via silica gel plug (ethyl acetate/hexanes) to afford X4 (370g, 91%) as a white solid. <sup>1</sup>HNMR (CDCl<sub>3</sub>, 400 MHz) \u03b4 7.83 (d, 1H), 7.43 (d, 1H), 7.35 (dd, 1H), 3.93 (s, 3H), 3.90 (s, 3H).</p>Compound X5:</p>To a 12 L 3-necked round bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, nitrogen inlet, and containing a solution of X4 (270 g, 0.925 mol) in THF (4 L) was added LiBH<sub>4 </sub>(60.4 g, 2.77 mol) portionwise at room temperature. The reaction mixture was placed in an ice bath and methanol (135 mL) was added dropwise. After the addition was complete the ice bath was removed and the reaction was heated to 65\u00b0 C. for 1 h. The reaction was then cooled in an ice bath and poured into an ice cold solution of saturated aq. NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (2 L) a"
