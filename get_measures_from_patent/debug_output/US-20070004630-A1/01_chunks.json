    "n the intestinal epithelium suggest a role in mucosal host defenses. Such a distribution is consistent with that of other antimicrobial peptides involved in antimicrobial protection (Zasloff, M., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:5449 (1987)). </p> (13) Assessment of the Antimicrobial Activity of AM and its Gene-Related Peptides (PAMP) Against Bacterial and Fungal Pathogens. </p> In order to assess the antimicrobial activity of AM and its gene related peptides, both microdilution and macrodilution assays were performed against Escherichia coli (E. coli), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) and Candida albicans (C. albicans). A germination assay was also performed in order to further assess anti-candidal activity (Ghannoum, M. A. and Radwan, S. S., Candida Adherence to Epithelial Cells. CRC Press; Boca Raton, Fla. 1990 pp. 72-104). </p> Initial experiments using conventional techniques (National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. Villanova, Pa. M7-A3, M27-P (1993)) for determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) assessed by turbidity at 24 hours did not reveal significant differences in MCIs between AM or AM gene-related peptides and controls. In order to assess the presence of subtle antimicrobial activity of AM and gene-related peptides not detectable by routine turbidimetric tests, more sensitive quantitative methods were performed as modifications of bacterial and fungal timed kill assays that would evaluate growth inhibition over time (Walsh, et al., Antimicrob. Chemother. 17:75 (1986); Roilides, et al., J. Infect. Dis. 163:579 (1991); Roilides, et al., J. Leukocyte Biol. 57:651 (1995)). </p> AM and PAMP were found to have activity after 6 hours of incubation against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and C. albicans but were ineffective against S. aureus. Several peptide fragments (Martinez, et al. Endocrinology 136:4099 (1995) representing the carboxy-terminal portion of AM (PO71 and PO72) and of PAMP (PO70) had little or no activity against these pathogens. However, preliminary findings suggest that the amino-terminal homologue of AM (AM1-12) exerted antimicrobial effects similar to those of intact AM in the microdilutional assay implicating that this fragment of AM could be responsible for the antimicrobial activity. AM and PAMP at 6 hours incubation showed higher growth inhibitory activity than albumin (negative control), PO70, PO71 and PO72 (p=0.03) and PAMP (0.0009). Am was five fold more active in the microdilution assay against P. aeruginosa than equimolar of human albumin controls (p=0.0666). </p> Antimicrobial activity was then evaluated in the macrodilution assay. There was initially no activity observed for AM at 6 hours, moderate activity for magainin, and even greater activity generated by PAMP (FIG. 23A). As of 24 hours incubation, however, the macrodilution pattern resembled that of the microdilutional assay with AM being somewhat more active than PAMP and magainin being signific",
    "could relate to surface charge repulsion phenomenology, proteolytic degradation of the peptide, or the lack of appropriate peptide/host interaction mediated by polysaccharide barrier of the bacterium. </p> (14) The Antimicrobial Effect of AM and Gene-Related Peptides (PAMP) Against C. albicans </p> The antimicrobial effect of AM and gene-related peptides was evaluated by macrodilutional and microdilutional assays against C. albicans, the common mucosal fungal pathogen of humans. The trends of antitrophic activity were less than those observed against E. coli and P. aeruainosa, particularly when compared with the albumin standard. However, there was a highly significant structure/function relationship found between the antimicrobial effect of AM (73%\u00b18.1) or PAMP (79.7%\u00b12.4) versus the carboxy-terminal portion of the peptide (46.8%\u00b111.1, p&lt;=0.004). While the overall activity of AM and PAMP was reduced in the macrodilutional assay, the relative patterns of antimicrobial activity were similar. Consistent with patterns observed for bacteria, magainin was more potent than AM and PAMP against C. albicans. </p> Germination is an important step in the pathogenesis of attachment and invasion of C. albicans to mucosal surfaces (Ghannoum, M. A. and Radwan, S. S., Candida Adherence to Epithelial Cells, CRC Press; Boca Raton, Fla., pp 72-104). The effects of AM and PAMP on germination of C. albicans were then studied as another indicator of antifungal activity. There was a significant inhibition of germination of C. albicans by increasing concentrations of AM at 4 hours incubation (FIG. 25) (p=0.048, ANOVA). There was a non-significant trend in the suppression of germination after 2 hours incubation. </p> The growth inhibitory properties of AM and PAMP were more active against the aerobic gram-negative bacteria, E. coli and P. aeruginosa, than against C. albicans and S. aureus. Such differential antimicrobial activity is also observed for the defensins and cecropins (Maloy, W. L. and Kari, U. P., Biopolymers (Peptide Science) 37:105 (1995); Lehrer, et al., Cell, 64:229 (1991)). For example, depending upon the amino acid sequences of cecropin peptides, which are found within porcine intestine, there are profound differences in antimicrobial activity against aerobic gram-negative bacilli (E. coli and P. aeruginosa) and gram-positive cocci (Micrococcus luteus). While there was minimum growth inhibitory activity of AM-related peptides against C. albicans, AM exerted a time-dependent inhibitory effect upon germination in cell culture media. </p> The concentrations at which these antimicrobial properties are achieved are generally 10 to 100 times greater than those of magainins and cecropins. However, if the tissue levels of these AM-related peptides are highly concentrated in the microenvironment, then the reported in vitro antimicrobial activity may also be active along epithelial cell surfaces. The antimicrobial effect was best observed at low inoculum concentrations, suggesting that organisms may degrade these AM-related peptides or that their cell targets may require a higher molar concentration for microbial effect. The antimicrobial mechanisms of the AM-related peptides remains to be further elucidated. Many of the antimicrobial peptides share in common highly basic properties and amphipathic activity with target cell membranes. Both AM and PAMP are highly charged moieties with isoelectric points of 9.7 and 11.1, respectively. Their amino acid structures contain extensive alpha/beta amphipathic regions which may simulate the membrane intercalation capabilities of magainin 1 and 2 (Oppenheim, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 263:7472 (1988)). FIG. 26 gives the amphipathic distribution and theoretical helical wheel symmetry of both peptides as calculated by DNASTAR software. </p> The antimicrobial properties of these AM-related peptides are dependent upon the assay used to measure their activity. For example, the activity of AM and PAMP appeared to be greater in the microdilutional assay than in the macrodilutional assay, suggesting that there may be interaction between the peptides and the glass or plastic surfaces. The kinetics of growth inhibition of those peptides, as well as other antimicrobial peptides, may differ substantially. As a case in point, the microbial activity of magainins became increasingly apparent at 24 hours by macrodilution, while adrenomedullin appeared to lose activity, possibly due to proteolytic cleavage. In a similar way, the class of salivary peptides known as histatins exert potent but transient activity lasting only for one to two hours before proteolysis inactivates activity (Oppenheim, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 263:7472 (1988)). </p> Consistent with a potential role of AM in host defense are the recent observations of Shoji, et al., Biochemical and Biophysical Research, 215:531 (1995), demonstrating the highest level of increased expression of AM in lung, liver, and spleen in rats challenged intravenously with lipopolysaccharide. These findings suggest an upregulation of this antimicrobial peptide in the reticuloendothelial system that may mediate host response to bacterial and fungal pathogens. The diverse endocrinologic and hemodynamic properties of AM and its genetically related peptides leads to the suggestion that perhaps other antimicrobial peptides may have a wider range of non-antimicrobial physiological activities than heretofore appreciated. </p> Accordingly, the present invention provides for novel adrenomedullin peptides for use as antibacterial and anti-fungal agents. Specifically, AM peptides are useful for the treatment of vaginal yeast infections, athlete's foot, a",
    "mmunogold staining at the electron microscopic level confirmed the colocalization of AM with pancreatic polypeptide in peripheral cells of rat pancreas (FIG. 18G). Consistent with the light immunohistochemical data, few immunogold particles detecting AM were found in other endocrine cell types by electron microscopy (FIG. 18H). </p> AM has some structural similarities to calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and amylin (K. Kitamura, K. Kangawa, H. Matsuo, T. Eto, Drugs 49, 485 (1995)), both of which are involved in pancreatic physiology. Nevertheless, the distribution of these three peptides in the pancreas varies: Amylin is mainly located in the \u03b2-cells, colocalizing with insulin (Mulder, et al., Cell Tissue Res. 274, 467 (1993)), and CGRP is present in pancreatic nerves as well as in peripheral cells of the islets (B. Ahren and F. Sundler, Cell Tissue Res. 269, 315 (1992)). The differential distribution of the immunoreactivities, together with the absorption controls, excludes a possible cross-reactivity of the AM antibody with amylin or CGRP. </p> (17) Physiological Effects of AM In Endocrine Pancreas Regulation </p> To identify the potential biological role of AM in the secretion of pancreatic hormones, three experimental models were used: isolated islets of Langerhans from rat, \u03b2-cell lines in culture, and oral glucose tolerance tests in rats. </p> The addition of AM to freshly isolated islets resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of insulin secretion (FIG. 19A). This inhibition reaches 78% for an AM concentration of 1 \u03bcM. Using MoAb-G6, a monoclonal antibody that neutralizes AM (M. J. Miller et al., Science (under editorial consideration)), a fivefold increase of insulin secretion was observed in the absence of extrinsic AM (FIG. 19A). Evidently, this striking effect was caused by neutralization of endogenous AM produced by the islets. The addition of extrinsic AM again resulted in a dose-dependent competitive inhibition (FIG. 19A). Consistent with this observation, cAMP levels increased in the islets when AM was added (FIG. 19B). </p> To investigate AM's effect on \u03b2-cells, the influence of AM in six well-characterized, insulin-producing cell lines was studied: RINm, N289, TR4, CRL 2057, CRL 1777, CRL 2055 (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md.). Although these cell lines expressed AM mRNA, as shown by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (FIG. 20), no change in insulin secretion rate was observed after administration of either AM or the monoclonal antibody (results not shown). These results suggest that \u03b2-cells, at least in culture, do not express AM receptors and apparently more complex interactions occur in the islets. To confirm this hypothesis, binding of <sup>125</sup>I-AM (0.2 nM per 5\u00d710<sup>5 </sup>cells) was investigated in RINm cells and in NCI-H1264, a lung adenocarcinoma used as a positive control. No binding (25 cpm) was observed in the RINm cells, but strong radioactivity (2265 cpm) was found in NCI-H1264. Possibly AM modulates a different cell type that, in turn, inhibits insulin secretion through endocrine or paracrine pathways. A similar mechanism has been described for amylin (R. A. Pittner et al., J. Cell. Biochem. 55S, 19 (1994)). Nevertheless, the existence of AM receptors in \u03b2-cells in vivo cannot be ruled out, although it has been shown that receptor systems that act in the \u03b2-cell through an increase in cAMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup>",

Growth Assays: MTT techniques were performed as previously described (Nakanishi, Y. F., et al., Exper. Cell Biol. 56:74-85 (1988)). In brief, a single cell suspension of 2\u00d710<sup>5 </sup>cells/ml (50 \u03bcl/well) is seeded into 96-well PVC plates and an appropriate concentration of MoAb-G6 and AM was added in a volume of 50 \u03bcl. The assay is performed in TIS medium (RMPI 1640 plus 10 \u03bcg/ml transferrin, 10 \u03bcg/ml insulin and 3\u00d710<sup>8</sup>M sodium selenite). After 5 days growth at 37\u00b0 C., 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, in a humid incubator, the dye and solubilization solutions were added from the Promega Proliferation Assay (Madison, Wis.), which is a variation of the MTT assay (Carmichael, Y. F., et al., Cancer Res. 47:943-946 (1987)). The Biorad Microplate Manager plate reader and software was used to determine the change in number of viable cells from dye reduction measured by absorbance at 570 nm.  \nTABLE 5% Growth \u00b1 s.d.CellMoAb-G6MoAb-G6 + AMLineTumor Type(100 \u03bcg/ml)(10 \u03bcM)H157adenosquamous68.6% \u00b1 7.491.8% \u00b1 8.4H720lung\u200264.3% \u00b1 18.3100.0% \u00b1 14.0carcinoidMCF-7breast44.7% \u00b1 4.389.7% \u00b1 5.8adenoCAOVCAR-3ovarian64.3% \u00b1 9.9\u200298.0% \u00b1 13.5adenoCASNUC-1colon96.8% \u00b1 4.5100.0% \u00b1 10.2adenoCA\n</p> Table 5 sets forth a summary of the inhibitory effects caused by MoAb-G6 and recovery with the addition of AM. Growth inhibition ranges between 25-60% in the tested cell lines as compared to control, that is, without the addition of MoAb-G6. Furthermore, specificity is demonstrated by reversing the effects of MoAb-G6 with the addition of synthetic AM. Colon cancer cell line, SNUC-1 did not respond to MoAb-G6.

Receptor Binding: Receptor binding analysis were performed as previously described (Moody, T. W., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90:4345-4349 (1993)). Briefly, cells (5\u00d710<sup>4</sup>) were placed in 24-well plates coated with fibronectin (20 \u03bcg). When a monolayer is formed, the cells were washed 4 times in TIS buffer followed by incubation with receptor binding medium (TIS plus 1% BSA and 1 mg/ml bacitracin). The cells were incubated with <sup>125</sup>I-AM (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals) for 30 mins at 37\u00b0 C. After washing the cells 4 times in receptor binding buffer at 4\u00b0 C., they were dissolved in 0.2 N NaOH and counted on a gamma counter. </p> k. cAMP Assays: Cyclic AMP was assayed by RIA using a kit obtained from New England Nuclear (Boston, Mass.). Cells in 24-well plates were resuspended in TIS medium containing 1% BSA, 1 mg/ml bacitracin and 100 \u03bcM isobutyl-methyl-xanthine. AM was added ranging from 0.1 pM-10 \u03bcM, and after 5 minutes, the reaction was terminated by adding an equal volume of ethanol. The supernatants were tested for cAMP using the RIA kit fo",
    "previously (Brown, et al., Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 150, 557 (1975)). Six rats were administered a glucose solution (400 mg/100 g body weight) via gastric intubation. Ocular blood samples were collected at intervals following glucose loading, and glucose concentration was determined by a calorimetric assay (Sigma). Blood insulin levels were determined on the same samples by radioimmunoassay (Amersham). Three days later, the same rats received 1 \u03bcL of AM (60 \u03bcM) per g body weight through intravenous injection and tolerance tests were repeated. Data are means \u00b1 standard deviations for the six animals. Two-tailed Student's test was performed to determine statistical significance. (*) indicates statistical significance (p&lt;0.01). </p>Example 20  The Localization of AM mRNA and Immunoreactivity in Various Organs of Different Species. </p> In situ RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were performed as described in Martinez, et al., Endocrinology 136:4099 (1995). Briefly, the tissues used for in situ RT-PCR were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, whereas the tissues for immunohistochemistry were fixed in Bouin's fluid (Sigma Chemical Co.). Controls for in situ RT-PCR included omission of the reverse transcriptase step of substitution of the specific primers by water. Negative controls for immunohistochemistry consisted in preabsorption of the antibody with 10 nmols/ml of synthetic AM or substitution of the primary antibody by preimmune serum. </p>Example 21  Effect of AMP and PAMP on the Inhibition of Growth of E. coli. </p> Inhibition of growth of E. coli was assessed in a microdilutional timed kill assay. (See FIG. 23) Bacteria and Candida albicans were grown overnight on trypticase soy agar (TSA) and Sobouraud dextrose agar (SDA) plates, respectively, were suspended into RPMI-1640 medium (Bio-Whittaker) and adjusted to a final concentration of 8\u00d710<sup>3 </sup>cfu/ml in 200 ul in plastic microdilution trays. AM-related peptides, magainins, and albumin were added in equimolar concentrations ranging from 8 uM to 300 uM. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. with gentle agitation over 24 hours. At 6 hr and 24 hr time points, 10 to 50 ul aliquots from each well were quantitatively cultured by serial 100-fold dilutions onto TSA and SDA plates. </p>Example 22  Antimicrobial Activity of AM and PAMP. </p> The antimicrobial activity of AM and PAMP was determined in a macrodilution assay after 6 hours of incubation of E. coli. (See FIG. 24A) There was initially no activity observed for AM at 6 hours, moderate activity for magainin, and greater activity generated by PAMP. As of the 24 hour incubation (see FIG. 24B) AM was slightly more active than PAMP in growth inhibition, while magainin (M) was more potent than either AM (p=0.006) or PAMP (p=0.004). Data were compiled from six experiments. Macrodilution assays were performed in 12\u00d775 mm borosilicate glass tubes. Organisms were grown and harvested, as described in Roilides, E., et al., J Infect Dis. 163:579 (1991), and adjusted to a final inoculum concentration of 8\u00d710<sup>3 </sup>cfu/ml in 400 ul. AM-related peptides, magainins, and albumin were added in equimolar concentrations ranging from 8 uM to 300 uM. Tubes were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. with gentle agitation over 24 hours. At 6 and 24 hour time points, 100 ul aliquots from each tube were quantitatively cultured by serial 100-fold dilutions onto TSA and SDA plates. </p>Example 23  The Effect of AM on the Termination of C. albicans. </p> There was a significant inhibition of germination of C. albicans by increasing concentrations of AM at 4 hours incubation (p=0.048, ANOVA) (see FIG. 25). The trend in suppression of germination after 2 hours incubation was not significant. Data were compiled from 11 experiments. Germination was determined by incubating colonies of C. albicans that were harvested from an overnight growth on SDA and suspended on RPMI-1640 containing concentrations of AM from 8 to 85 uM. Organisms were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. and germination was measured at 2 h and 4 h by reading 100 to 200 organisms per concentration per time point in each experiment. Percent germination was assessed as the proportion of blastoconidia of C. albicans bearing the characteristic parallel-walled tubular element to the total number of blastoconidia. </p>REFERENCES  1.
