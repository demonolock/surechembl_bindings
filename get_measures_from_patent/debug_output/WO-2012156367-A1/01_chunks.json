    " EU-W1024 labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody [Perkin-Elmer, product no. AD0077, as an alternative a Terbium-cryptate-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody from Cisbio Bioassays can be used]) in an aqueous EDTA-solution (100 mM EDTA, 0.2 % (w/v) bovine serum albumin in 100 mM HEPES/ sodium hydroxide pH 7.0). The resulting mixture was incubated 1 h at 22' C to allow the formation of complex between the phosphorylated biotinylated peptide and the detection reagents. Subsequently the amount of phosphorylated substrate was evaluated by measurement of the resonance energy transfer from the Eu-chelate to the streptavidine-XL. Therefore, the fluorescence emissions at 620 nm and 665 nm after excitation at 350 nm was measured in a TR-FRET reader, e.g. a Rubystar (BMG Labtechnologies, Offenburg, Germany) or a Viewlux (Perkin-Elmer). The ratio of the emissions at 665 nm and at 622 nm was taken as the measure for the amount of phosphorylated substrate. The data were normalised (enzyme reaction without inhibitor = 0% inhibition, all other assay components but no enzyme = 100 % inhibition). Usually the test compounds were tested on the same microtiterplate in 1 1 different concentrations in the range of 20 \u03bc\u039c to 0.1 nM (20 \u03bc\u039c, 5.9 \u03bc\u039c, 1 .7 \u03bc\u039c, 0.51 \u03bc\u039c, 0.15 \u03bc\u039c, 44 nM, 13 nM, 3.8 nM, 1 .1 nM, 0.33 nM and 0.1 nM, the dilution series prepared separately before the assay on the level of the 100fold concentrated solutions in DMSO by serial 1 :3.4 dilutions) in duplicate values for each concentration and IC50 values were calculated by a 4 parameter fit. \n\n PDGF B kinase assay </p>PDGFRB inhibitory activity of compounds of the present invention was quantified employing the PDGFRft HTRF assay as described in the following paragraphs. </p>As kinase, a GST-His fusion protein containing a C-terminal fragment of human PDGFRB (amino acids 561 - 1 106, expressed in insect cells [SF9] and purified by affinity chromatography, purchased from Proqinase [Freiburg i.Brsg. , Germany] was used.
