    "odies capable of detecting at least 20% of primary or metastatic prostate tumors by such procedures are considered to be useful in assays for detecting primary or metastatic human prostate tumors. Polypeptide specific antibodies may be used alone or in combination to improve sensitivity.</p>\n  Polypeptides and/or fusion proteins capable of detecting primary or metastatic human prostate tumors may be used as markers for diagnosing prostate cancer or for monitoring disease progression in patients. In one embodiment, prostate cancer in a patient may be diagnosed by evaluating a biological sample obtained from the patient for the level of \n\none or more of the above polypeptides, relative to a predetermined cut-off value. As used herein, suitable \"biological samples\" include blood, sera, urine and/or prostate secretions.</p>\n  The level of one or more of the above polypeptides may be evaluated using any binding agent specific for the polypeptide(s). A \"binding agent,\" in the context of this invention, is any agent (such as a compound or a cell) that binds to a polypeptide as described above. As used herein, \"binding\" refers to a noncovalent association between two separate molecules (each of which may be free (i.e., in solution) or present on the surface of a cell or a solid support), such that a \"complex\" is formed. Such a complex may be free or immobilized (either covalently or noncovalently) on a support material. The ability to bind may generally be evaluated by determining a binding constant for the formation of the complex. The binding constant is the value obtained when the concentration of the complex is divided by the product of the component concentrations. In general, two compounds are said to \"bind\" in the context of the present invention when the binding constant for complex formation exceeds about 10<sup>3</sup> L/mol. The binding constant may be determined using methods well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.</p>\n  Any agent that satisfies the above requirements may be a binding agent. For example, a binding agent may be a ribosome with or without a peptide component, an RNA molecule or a peptide. In a preferred embodiment, the binding partner is an antibody, or a fragment thereof. Such antibodies may be polyclonal, or monoclonal. In addition, the antibodies may be single chain, chimeric, CDR-grafted or humanized. Antibodies may be prepared by the methods described herein and by other methods well known to those of skill in the art.</p>\n  There are a variety of assay formats known to those of ordinary skill in the art for using a binding partner to detect polypeptide markers in a sample. See, e.g., Harlow and Lane, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 1988. In a preferred embodiment, the assay involves the use of binding partner immobilized on a solid support to bind to and remove the polypeptide from the remainder of the sample. The bound polypeptide may then be detected using a second binding partner that contains a reporter group. Suitable second binding partners include antibodies that bind to the binding partner/polypeptide complex. Alternatively, a competitive assay may be utilized, in which a \n\npolypeptide is labeled with a reporter group and allowed to bind to the immobilized binding partner after incubation of the binding partner with the sample.
