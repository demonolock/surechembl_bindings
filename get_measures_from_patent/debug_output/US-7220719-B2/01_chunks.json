    ". A single target site typically has about four to about ten base pairs. Typically, a two-fingered ZFP recognizes a four to seven base pair target site, a three-fingered ZFP recognizes a six to ten base pair target site, and a six fingered ZFP recognizes two adjacent nine to ten base pair target sites. By way of example, a DNA target sequence for a three-finger ZFP is generally either 9 or 10 nucleotides in length, depending upon the presence and/or nature of cross-strand interactions between the ZFP and the target sequence. Target sequences can be found in any DNA or RNA sequence, including regulatory sequences, exons, introns, or any non-coding sequence.</p>A \u201ctarget subsite\u201d or \u201csubsite\u201d is the portion of a DNA target site that is bound by a single zinc finger, excluding cross-strand interactions. Thus, in the absence of cross-strand interactions, a subsite is generally three nucleotides in length. In cases in which a cross-strand interaction occurs (e.g., a \u201cD-able subsite,\u201d as described for example in co-owned PCT WO 00/42219, incorporated by reference in its entirety herein) a subsite is four nucleotides in length and overlaps with another 3- or 4-nucleotide subsite.</p>The term \u201cadjacent target sites\u201d refers to non-overlapping target sites that are separated by zero to about 5 base pairs.</p>The term \u201cnaturally-occurring\u201d is used to describe an object that can be found in nature, as distinct from being artificially produced by a human.</p>\u201cK<sub>d</sub>\u201d refers to the dissociation constant for the compound, i.e., the concentration of a compound (e.g., a zinc finger protein) that gives half maximal binding of the compound to its target (i.e., half of the compound molecules are bound to the target) under given conditions (i.e., when [target] &lt;&lt;K<sub>d</sub>), as measured using a given assay system (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,789,538). The assay system used to measure the K<sub>d </sub>should be chosen so that it gives the most accurate measure of the actual K<sub>d </sub>of the ZFP. Any assay system can be used, as long is it gives an accurate measurement of the actual K<sub>d </sub>of the ZFP. In one embodiment, the K<sub>d </sub>for a ZFP is measured using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (\u201cEMSA\u201d), as described in Example 1 and elsewhere in the present specification. Unless an adjustment is made for ZFP purity or activity, the K<sub>d </sub>calculations made using the method of Example 1 may result in an underestimate of the true K<sub>d </sub>of a given ZFP. Preferably, the K<sub>d </sub>of a ZFP used to modulate transcription of an endogenous cellular gene is less than about 100 nM, more preferably less than about 75 nM, more preferably less than about 50 nM, most preferably less than about 25 nM.</p>\u201cSpecific binding\u201d between, for example, a ZFP and a specific target site means a binding affinity of at least 1\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>.</p>An \u201cexogenous molecule\u201d is a molecule that is not normally present in a cell, but"
