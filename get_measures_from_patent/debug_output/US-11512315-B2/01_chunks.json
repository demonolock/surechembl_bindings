    "e-stranded MOE chemistry. Untreated polarized macrophages and polarized macrophages incubated with unmodified exosomes were used as negative control. Stat 3 siRNA transfected macrophages were used as positive control.</p>FIG. 7 shows Arg1 transcript level in M2 polarized murine RAW264.7 cells after incubation with 5 \u03bcM free cholesterol-tagged ASO or either 1\u00d710<sup>5 </sup>or 1\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>exosomes loaded with the cholesterol-tagged ASO. Five different cholesterol-tagged ASOs targeting STAT3 were tested: ASO 4.1, double-stranded MOE chemistry; ASO 5.1 and ASO 5.2, single-stranded O-methyl chemistry; ASO 5.3 and ASO 5.4, single-stranded MOE chemistry. Untreated polarized macrophages and polarized macrophages incubated with unmodified exosomes were used as negative control. Stat 3 siRNA transfected macrophages were used as positive control.</p>FIG. 8A shows STAT3 expression in M2 polarized murine RAW264.7 cells after incubation with high (4 \u03bcM) dose of ASO or high (4 \u03bcM) and low (0.4 \u03bcM) doses of Exo-ASO for STAT3. FIG. 8B shows KRAS expression in M2 polarized murine RAW264.7 cells after incubation with high (4 \u03bcM) high dose of ASO or Exo-ASO for KRAS. FIG. 8C shows C/EBP\u03b2 expression in M2 polarized murine RAW264.7 cells after incubation with high (4 \u03bcM) and low (0.4 \u03bcM) doses of ASO or Exo-ASO for C/EBP\u03b2.</p>FIG. 9A shows STAT3 transcript level in primary human macrophages from three separate donors after treatment with varying doses of free STAT3 ASO or STAT3 Exo-ASO. The IC50 of each treatment and the fold improvement of STAT3 Exo-ASO compared to free STAT3 ASO are presented. FIG. 9B shows CD163 level in primary human macrophages from three separate donors after treatment with varying doses of free STAT3 ASO or STAT3 Exo-ASO. The IC50 of each treatment and fold improvement of STAT3 Exo-ASO compared to free STAT3 ASO are presented.</p>FIG. 10 shows the target gene expression in human M2 macrophages after treatment with 4 \u03bcM free ASO or Exo-ASO for HIF1\u03b1, Pi3K\u03b3, CEBP/\u03b2, STAT6, and STAT3 respectively. Untreated human M2 macrophages and human M2 macrophages treated with 4 \u03bcM scrambled Exo ASO were used as control.</p>FIG. 11 shows CD163 expression in human M2 macrophages after treatment with 4 \u03bcM free ASO or Exo-ASO for HIF1\u03b1, Pi3K\u03b3, CEBP/\u03b2, STAT6, and STAT3 respectively. Untreated human M2 macrophages and human M2 macrophages treated with 4 \u03bcM scrambled Exo ASO were used as control.</p>FIG. 12A shows the induction of IL-12 after treatment with 4 \u03bcM free STAT3 ASO, 4 \u03bcM STAT3 Exo-ASO, 4 \u03bcM scrambled Exo-ASO, native exosomes, or C188-9, a small molecule inhibitor of STAT3 in the presence or absence of LPS. FIG. 12B shows the induction of IL-23 after treatment with 4 \u03bcM free STAT3 ASO, 4 \u03bcM STAT3 Exo-ASO, 4 \u03bcM scrambled Exo-ASO, native exosomes, or C188-9, a small molecule inhibitor of STAT3 in the presence or absence of LPS.</p>FIG. 13A shows the STAT3 transcript level after treatment with unmodified exosomes (EV only), and concentration-matched Stat 3 Free ASO and Stat 3 Exo-ASO. FIG. 13B shows the CD163 transcript level after treatment with unmodified exosomes (EV only), and concentration-matched Stat 3 Free ASO and Stat 3 Exo-ASO.
