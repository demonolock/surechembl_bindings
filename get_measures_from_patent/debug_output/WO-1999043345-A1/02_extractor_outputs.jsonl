{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\nThe EC 50 for protection was approximately 300 \u03bcg/ml.\nN18 neuroblastoma cells were treated with the general nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, N<sup>G</sup>-methyl-L-arginine (L-NMA, 100 \u03bcM, Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA)\nThe cells were pre- or co-treated with the NOS inhibitors in conjunction with SN infection, with or without arginase treatment (2.5 \u03bcg/ml).\nFigure 2 A also demonstrates that N18 neuroblastoma cell survival increased to about 90% of control at the arginase concentration of 2 \u03bcg/ml.\nAddition of asparaginase (1-5 U/ml) to Sindbis virus infected cells increased cell survival to about 65% of control."}
