    "infection in the absence of arginase reduced cell survival to approximately 10% of control. This value is lower than that reported in Figure 2 for El 8 cortical neurons, a discrepancy which likely results from the presence of glial cells in the El 8 cortical neuron preparation. These glial cells are less susceptible to death, and thus increase the overall percentage of cell survival. Figure 2 A also demonstrates that N18 neuroblastoma cell survival increased to about 90% of control at the arginase concentration of 2 \u03bcg/ml.</p>\n  In addition, as is shown in Figure 3, arginase (0.5 \u03bcg/ml) decreased cell death in cortical neurons exposed to staurosporine. Staurosporine exposure increased cell death, reducing cell survival to approximately 30% of control, whereas addition of arginase restored cell survival to approximately 90% of control.</p>\n  Additional evidence indicates that the above described protective effect of arginase is due to amino acid degradation rather than formation of the arginase reaction products ornithine and urea. First, degradation of arginine by another degrading enzyme, arginine decarboxylase, also decreased cell death. As shown in Figure 4, Sindbis virus infection, in the absence of arginine decarboxylase, increased cell death in N18 neuroblastoma cells, reducing cell survival to approximately 12% of control, whereas increasing doses of arginine decarboxylase increased cell survival, restoring it to approximately 100% of control at a dose of 1 mg/ml. The EC 50 for \n\n -11- protection was approximately 300 \u03bcg/ml. Second, degradation of another amino acid, asparagine, also decreased cell death. As shown in Figure 5, Sindbis virus infection reduced N18 neuroblastoma cell survival to about 12% of control. Addition of asparaginase (1-5 U/ml) to Sindbis virus infected cells increased cell survival to about 65% of control.</p>\n  Taken together, these results demonstrate that amino acid degradation protects cells from death induced by a variety of cell-death inducing conditions, e.g., oxidative stress, Sindbis virus infection, and staurosporine exposure.</p>\n  Protection from cell death by amino acid degradation is nitric oxide independent Although arginine is a precursor of nitric oxide (NO), the following experiments show that arginase 's protection against cell death is independent of NO formation.</p>\n  Methods Nl 8 neuroblastoma cells were treated with the general nitric oxide synthase</p>\n  (NOS) inhibitor, N<sup>G</sup>-methyl-L-arginine (L-NMA, 100 \u03bcM, Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) (Dawson et al.

The cells were pre- or co-treated with the NOS inhibitors in conjunction with SN infection, with or without arginase treatment (2.5 \u03bcg/ml).</p>\n  Cortical neurons were treated with the general \u039dOS inhibitor, \u039d<sup>G</sup>-nitro-L- arginine methyl ester hydroc"
