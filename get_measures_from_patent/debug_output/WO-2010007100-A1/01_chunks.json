    "s such as signal transduction, proliferation, differentiation, programmed cell death, migration and cytokine secretion. More specifically the invention provides compounds which inhibit, regulate and/or modulate kinase activity, in particular PBK activity, and signal transduction pathways relating to cellular activities as mentioned above. Furthermore, the present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising said compounds, e.g. for the treatment of diseases such as immunological, inflammatory, autoimmune and allergic disorders, and processes for preparing said compounds.</p>Protein and lipid kinases participate in the signaling events which control the activation, growth, differentiation and survival of cells in response to extracellular mediators or stimuli such as growth factors, cytokines or chemokines. In general, protein kinases are classified in two groups, those that preferentially phosphorylate tyrosine residues and those that preferentially phosphorylate serine and/or threonine residues in their protein substrates. By contrast, lipid kinases phosphorylate a variety of lipid substrates.</p>Inappropriately high protein or lipid kinase activity is involved in many diseases including cancer, metabolic diseases, immunological diseases and inflammatory disorders. This can be caused either directly or indirectly by the failure of control mechanisms due to mutation, overexpression or inappropriate activation of the enzyme. In all of these instances, selective inhibition of the kinase is expected to have a beneficial therapeutic effect.</p>Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (also called Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases, PBKs) represent a group of lipid kinases that play pivotal roles in numerous intracellular signaling events, for example in T-cell receptor signaling. Some members of the PBK family also display protein kinase activity (Vanhaesebroeck et al., 2001, Annu. Rev. Biochem. 70:535-602). \n\n PBKs belongs to a superfamily of signaling lipid kinases that catalyse the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2 or phosphatidylinositol (Ptdlns) at the 3'-OH group, giving rise to the second messengers phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) or phosphatidylinosito 1-3 -phosphate (PtdIns(3)P). PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 can be converted into PtdIns(3,4)P2 by SH2-containing inositol phosphatase (SHIP), or can be dephosphorylated by phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) phosphatase to regenerate PtdIns(4,5)P2. The 3'-phosphorylated phosphoinositides, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, PtdIns(3,4)P2 PtdIns(4,5)P2, PtdIns(5)P and PtdIns(3)P, recruit and activate various signalling proteins (Ptdlnsbinding proteins; Ptdlns-BPs) through direct lipid-protein interactions (Hawkins et al., 2006, Biochem. Soc. Trans. 34:647-62).</p>Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) has an important role as second messenger by working as a docking platform for lipid-binding domains, such as the pleckstrin homology (PH) domai",
    "c, phagosom maturation and autophagy (Falasca et al, 2007, Biochem. Soc. Trans. 35:211-4; Lindmo et al, 2006, J. Cell Sci. 119:605-14).</p>The class IA - PBK\u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b4 (PIK3CA, PIK3CB and PIK3CD) - consists of an SH2-domain- containing regulatory subunit (p85; five distinct isoforms of which have been identified) that forms a complex with one of three catalytic subunits, pl lO\u03b1, pl lO\u03b2 or pl lO\u03b4. (Bader et al., 2005, Nat. Rev. Cancer 5(12):921-9).</p>Genetic polymorphisms within the PBK pathway are also associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Downstream of the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGFl) receptor, signaling through class I PBK controls growth and development. Amplification and point mutations of the gene encoding PBK\u03b1 that increase the enzymatic activity of the protein have been frequently found in human cancers (Bader et al., 2005, Nat. Rev. Cancer 5(12):921-9).</p>PBK activation and PIP3 production are fundamental for most biological responses exerted by insulin. Activated insulin receptor (IR) triggers PBK activity by binding and phosphorylating adaptor proteins of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) family. Upon phoshphorylation IRS serves as a docking site for p85 regulatory subunits that consequently recruit pi 10 enzymes (mainly \u03b1 and \u03b2 isoforms). PIP3 production in turn activates downstream effectors that control various metabolic processes such as glucose uptake, triglyceride formation, glycogen synthesis, lipolysis and hepatic gluconeogenesis inhibition</p>(Knight et al., 2006, Cell 125(4): 733-747; Foukas et al., 2006, Nature, 441(7091):366-70).</p>PBK\u03b2 has been implicated in regulating the formation and stability of integrin \u03b1(IIb)\u03b2(3), which is necessary for the activation and aggregation of platelets. Isoform-selective PBK pl lO\u03b2 inhibitors have been developed which in vivo eliminate occlusive thrombus formation but do not prolong bleeding time. These studies define PBK pi lO\u03b2 as an important new target for antithrombotic therapy (Jackson et al., 2005, Nat. Med. 11 (5):507-14). \n\n PBK\u03b4 is predominantly expressed in the haematopoietic system and PBK\u03b4-deficient mice are viable, fertile, apparently healthy and have a normal life span (Vanhaesebroeck et al., 2005. Trends in Biochemical Sciences 30, 194-204). PBK\u03b4 has important roles in T- and B-cell signaling, mast-cell-mediated allergic responses, the neutrophils oxidative burst and, possibly, extravasation. PBK inhibitors selective for PBK\u03b4 were reported to block neutrophil activation in an animal model for neutrophil activation, thus pointing to PBk\u03b4 as a target for the development of anti-inflammatory drugs (Sadhu et al., 2003, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Communications 308, 764-769).</p>PBKy, the only member of class IB (PIK3CG), associates with either of two regulatory subunits, plOl and p84, that control its activation and subcellular location. PBKy activation is driven by the direct association of its catalytic domain with the \u03b2\u03b3 subunits of G proteins followin",
    "isease (COPD); acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); bronchitis; conjunctivitis; dermatitis; and allergic rhinitis; acute gouty inflammation; cystic fibrosis; familial Mediterranean fever; tissue damage after bacterial infection; Sweet's syndrome; or anaphylaxis. \n\n More preferred are rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), psoriasis, multiple sclerosis (MS), asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</p>Yet another object of the present invention is a method for treating, controlling, delaying or preventing in a mammalian patient in need of the treatment of one or more conditions selected from the group consisting of cancer; metabolic diseases; neurodegenerative disorders; infectious diseases and cardiovascular disorders, more specifically myocardial infarction, stroke, ischemia or atherosclerosis, wherein the method comprises the administration to said patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound according to the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.</p>As used herein, the term \"treating\" or \"treatment\" is intended to refer to all processes, wherein there may be a slowing, interrupting, arresting, or stopping of the progression of a disease, but does not necessarily indicate a total elimination of all symptoms.</p>Without intending to be limited by theory, the compounds of the invention may also modulate in addition or alternatively immune cell activation via inhibition of PBK. Especially the important roles of PBK\u03b4 and PBK\u03b3 in signaling and other functions of T cells, B cells, neutrophils, macrophages and mast cells indicate that these kinases are valid therapeutic targets for several inflammation-mediated diseases. These diseases comprise rheumatoid arthritis (in which T cells, B cells and neutrophils are involved), systemic lupus erythematosus (in which neutrophils are involved), psoriasis (in which T cells, neutrophils and macrophages are engaged), multiple sclerosis (in which T cells, B cells and mast cells are implicated), asthma (for which T cell and mast cells are important), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (which involves neutrophils, macrophages and T cells) (Rommel et al, 2007, Nat. Rev. Immunology 7:191-201).</p>In some cases, the link between PBK\u03b4 and PBK\u03b3 as potential drug targets for specific diseases has been experimentally established by testing the respective PBK-null mice in animal disease models. Additional pharmacological confirmation was obtained by using small molecule PBK inhibitors in wild-type mice in which inflammatory diseases were experimentally induced. \n\n Camps and colleagues used structure-based drug design to develop a potent small molecule inhibitor of PIK3\u03b3 referred to as AS-605240 (Camps et al, 2005. Nat. Med. l l(9):936-43). It was observed that Pik3cg-null mice were protected against arthritis induced by collagen II- specif\u03cac antibodies, a murine model of lymphocyte-independent rheumatoid arthritis (RA) associated with neutrophil activation. The effect was associated with impaired neutrophil chemotaxis. Treatment of wildtype mice with oral AS-605420 resulted in reduced clinical and histologic signs of collagen II-antibody-induced arthritis, similar to that seen in the Pik3cg- null mice. Oral AS-605240 also resulted in decreased joint inflammation and damage in a distinct mouse model of lymphocyte-dependent rheumatoid arthritis induced by direct collagen II injection. The authors concluded that PIK3CG inhibition operates on both the neutrophil and lymphocyte arms of chemokine signaling pathways, and thus may be of therapeutic value in various chronic inflammatory diseases.</p>In the MRL-lpr mouse model of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) it was found that intraperitoneal administration of the pharmacologic PI3K\u03b3 inhibitor AS-605240 reduced CD4+ T-cell populations, reduced glomerulonephritis, and prolonged life span (Barber et al., 2005, Nat. Med. ll(9):933-935).</p>The involvement of PI3 kinases in allergic inflammatory diseases such as asthma was demonstrated through pharmacological inhibition by non-selective PI3K inhibitors such as wortmannin and LY294002. However, these compounds were not selective enough to discriminate between distinct PI3K isoforms (Walker et al., 2006, Drug Discovery Today: Disease Mechanisms, 3(l):63-69).</p>Using selective PI3K\u03b4 inhibitors it was demonstrated that PI3K\u03b4 plays a role in neutrophil inflammatory responses. Inhibition of PI3K\u03b4 blocked both fMLP- and TNF l\u03b1- induced neutrophil superoxide generation and elastase exocytosis (Sadhu et al., 2003, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003 Sep 5;308(4):764-769).</p>The essential role of PI3K\u03b4 in allergic responses was demonstrated by genetic and pharmacological inactivation of PI3K\u03b4 in mast cells. This inhibition leads to to defective SCF-mediated in vitro proliferation, adhesion and migration, and to impaired allergen-IgE- induced degranulation and cytokine release. Moreover, inactivation of PI3K\u03b4 protects mice against anaphylactic allergic responses. Taken together, these studies suggest PI3K\u03b4 as a \n\n target for therapeutic intervention in allergy and mast-cell-related diseases (AIi et al., 2004, Nature 431 :1007-1011).</p>Recently, the effect of genetic inactivation of the Pi3kcd gene in mice on systemic cytokine and chemokine responses and allergic airway inflammation was reported. Type 2 cytokine responses (IL-4, IL-5, and IL- 13) were significantly decreased in PI3K\u03b4 mutants, whereas type 1 cytokine responses (IFN-\u03b3 CXCLlO) were robust. For example, induction of respiratory hyper-responsiveness to inhaled methacholine, a hallmark of asthma, was attenuated in PI3K\u03b4 null mice. In summary, these data suggest PI3K\u03b4 as a new target for TH2-mediated airway diseases (Nashed et al., 2007, Eur. J. Immunol. 37:416-424).</p>Accordingly, diseases and disorders are preferred which are associated with PI3K delta and/or PI3K gamma. Especially preferred are inflammatory and immunoregulatory disorders rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p>As mentioned above, PI3K also plays a role with regard to cancer and cardiovascular disorders.</p>PI3K\u03b3 has been proposed as a possible target for pharmacological intervention in the primary and secondary prevention of human atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Atherosclerosis and its sequelae, including myocardial infarction and stroke, are the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in the developed world. It has been reported that PI3K\u03b3 is activated in macrophages by oxidized LDL, agonists, chemokines and inflammatory mediators commonly implicated in atherogenesis. Genetic ablation of PBKg in hypercholesterolemic mice (apoE-/-) results in reduced atherosclerotic lesions. In addition to retarding plaque progression, it is of clinical relevance the possibility that the inhibition of PBK might affect plaque stability (Chang et al., 2007, PNAS 104 (19):8077-82).</p>This may be based on the fact that signaling through PBK\u03b3 plays an important role for leucocyte, platelet and cardiovascular stress sensing. The concerted activation of leukocytes and vessels influences may physiological and pathological responses usually leading to the production of intracellular second messenger molecules such as phosphatidylinositol(3,4,5)- trisphosphate (PIP3), which is produced by PBK\u03b3, a crucial signal in both vascular and white blood cells. The study of mice lacking PBK\u03b3 revealed that the PIP3 signaling pathway \n\n controls immune cell and vascular functions such as respiratory burst, cell recruitment, mast cell reactivity, platelet aggregation, endothelial activation and smooth muscle cell contractility. The specificity of these events suggests that inhibition of PBK\u03b3 may be beneficial for major cardiovascular disorders such as hypertension (Hirsch et al., 2006, Thromb. Haemost. 95(l):29-35).</p>Myocardial infarction (MI) results from a biphasic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury to the heart, initiating with cardiomyocyte apoptosis (Crow et al., 2004, Circ. Res. 95(10):957-970) and then proceeding to a second wave of inflammation-based tissue damage (Frangogiannis et al., 2002, Cardiovasc. Res. 53(1):31-47). Recently, it was reported that a small molecule inhibitor of PBK gamma and delta provided cardioprotection in an animal model of myocardial infarction. This compound, TGlOO-115, potently inhibits edema and inflammation in response to multiple mediators known to play a role in myocardial infarction. Importantly, this was achieved when dosing after myocardial reperfusion (up to 3 hours after), the same time period when patients are most accessible for therapeutic intervention (Doukas et al., 2006, PNAS 103(52):19866-19871; Doukas et al., 2007, Biochem. Soc. Trans. 35(Pt2):204- 206; Palanki et al., 2007, J. Med. Chem. 50(18)4279-4294).</p>The first study to describe point mutations of the PIK3CA gene, which encodes the pl lO\u03b1 catalytic subunit, in colorectal, brain, gastric, breast and lung cancers, was reported in 2004.</p>Subsequently, several additional point mutations were identified in other cancer types</p>(reviewed by Bader et al., 2005, Nat. Rev. Cancer 5(12): 921-929). It was demonstrated that</p>PIK3CA mutants",

LCMS (method A), (M+H<sup>+</sup>) 365, Rt = 7.41 min. \n\n Example 22: Determination of the effect of the compounds according to the invention on PBK</p>The compounds of the present invention as described in example 1 can be tested in the PBK kinobeads assay as described (EP-A 1 887 359). Briefly, test compounds (at various concentrations) and the affinity matrix with the immobilized phenylthiazole ligand 1 are added to cell lysate aliquots and allowed to bind to the proteins in the lysate sample. After the incubation time the beads with captured proteins are separated from the lysate. Bound proteins are then eluted and the presence of PBK enzymes are detected and quantified using a specific antibody in a dot blot procedure and the Odyssey infrared detection system.</p>Conventionally, PBK lipid kinase activity can be measured using purified or recombinant enzyme in a solution-based assay with phopholipid vesicles.</p>The reaction is terminated by the addition of acidified organic solvents and subsequent phase separation by extraction or thin layer chromatography analysis (Carpenter et al., 1990, J. Biol. Chem. 265, 19704-19711).</p>Another assay described in the art is based on the phosphate transfer from radiolabeled ATP to phosphatidylinositol immobilized on plates. This assay type also uses recombinant PBK gamma enzyme but can be performed in a high throughput mode (Fuchikami et al., 2002, J. Biomol.
