Preferred donors comprise the structure: Asn-GlcNAc-X, wherein X is the oligosaccharide or monosaccharide that is transferred to the target protein comprising an acceptor.</p>The term \"activated alkyne ,\" as used herein, refers to a chemical moiety that selectively reacts with an alkyne modified group on another molecule to form a covalent chemical bond between the alkyne modified group and the alkyne reactive group. Examples of alkyne-reactive groups include azides. \"Alkyne-reactive\" can also refer to a molecule that contains a chemical moiety that selectively reacts with an alkyne group.</p>The term \"affinity,\" as used herein, refers to the strength of the binding interaction of two molecules, such as an antibody and an antigen or a positively charged moiety and a negatively charged moiety. For bivalent molecules such as antibodies, affinity is typically defined as the binding strength of one binding domain for the antigen, e.g. one Fab fragment for the antigen. The binding strength of both binding domains together for the antigen is referred to as \"avidity\". As used herein \"High affinity\" refers to a ligand that binds to an antibody having an affinity constant (K<sub>a</sub>) greater than 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>, typically 10<sup>5</sup>-10<sup>11</sup> m<sup>-1</sup>; as determined by inhibition ELISA or an equivalent affinity determined by comparable techniques such as, for example, Scatchard plots or using K<sub>d</sub>/dissociation constant, which is the reciprocal of the K<sub>a</sub>.</p>The term \"alkyne reactive,\" as used herein, refers to a chemical moiety that selectively reacts with an alkyne modified group on another molecule to form a covalent chemical bond between the alkyne modified group and the alkyne reactive group. Examples of alkyne-reactive groups include azides. \"Alkyne-reactive\" can also refer to a molecule that contains a chemical moiety that selectively reacts with an alkyne group.</p>The term \"antibody\" as used herein refers to an immunoglobulin molecule or immunologically active portion thereof, i.e., an antigen-binding portion. Examples of immunologically active portions of immunoglobulin molecules include immunoglobulin molecules or fragments thereof that comprise the F(ab) region and a sufficient portion of the Fc region to comprise the oligosaccharide linkage site, for example, the asparagine-GlcNAc linkage site. An antibody sometimes is a polyclonal, monoclonal, recombinant (e.g., a chimeric or humanized), fully human, non-human (e.g., murine), or a single chain antibody. An antibody may have effector function and can fix complement, and is sometimes coupled to a toxin or imaging agent. An antibody is, for example, an IgG.</p>The term \"antibody fragments\" as used herein refers to fragments of antibodies that retain the principal selective binding characteristics of the whole antibody. Particular fragments are well-known in the art, for example, Fab, Fab', and F(ab",
    "ls from the GlcNAc-treated cells, were precipitated with chloroform/methanol, dissolved in detergent, and labeled with a fluorescent alkyne probe in the presence of 1 mM CuSO4, and 5 mM ascorbic acid (1). 10 \u00b5g of the labeled, precipitated proteins were run on 1-D NuPAGE\u00ae Novex\u00ae 4-12% gels (Invitrogen). Images were obtained on the Fuji FLA-3000 scanner (Fuji) using 532 nm excitation (Fig 5A). Gels were then post stained with SYPRO\u00ae Ruby stain (Invitrogen) and imaged using excitation at 473 nm (Fig 5B). Control lanes represent extracts from unfed cells but treated with the fluorescent probe. See Figure 5.</p>Example 5: Separation of Ac<sub>4</sub>GlcNAz-treated soluble jurkat cell proteins by 2-D gelsJurkat cells were cultured overnight with 250 \u00b5M Ac<sub>4</sub>GlcNAz or DMSO vehicle (control unfed). Soluble lysate proteins were prepared as for Example 4 using sonication and ultracentrifugation and labeled for 1 hour with a fluorescent alkyne probe. 40 \u00b5g of the labeled proteins were precipitated and resolubilized in 7M urea, 2M thiourea, 65 mM DTT, 2% CHAPS, 1% Zwittergent 3-10, 1% pH 3-10 carrier ampholytes and separated on pH 3-10 IEF strips in the first dimension and 4-12% Bis-Tris gels with MOPS buffer in the second dimension. Images were obtained on the Fuji FLA-3000 scanner (Fuji) using 532 nm excitation Gels were then post stained with SYPRO\u00ae Ruby stain (Invitrogen) and imaged again using excitation at 473 nm. See Figure 6.</p>Example 6: In Gel detection of 40 and 50 kD azide-labeled model proteins25 pmols each of 40 and 50 kD model proteins with single N-terminal azides were spiked into 100 \u00b5g of Jurkat cell lysates (upper panels), or not (lower panels). Proteins were labeled with a fluorescent alkyne probe, serially diluted as shown, and run on NuPAGE\u00ae Novex\u00ae 4-12% gels. Images (left panels) were obtained on the FLA-3000 scanner using 532 nm excitation. Gels were then post stained with SYPRO\u00ae Ruby stain and imaged using excitation at 473 nm (right panels). Detection sensitivity of the labeled proteins is less than 10 femtomoles. See, figure 7.</p>Example 7: Labeling Efficiency of 40 and 50 kd Azide-Labeled Model Proteins is Unchanged in Complex Protein ExtractsEither 100 ng (25 pmol) or 10 ng (2.5 pmol) each of azide-labeled 40 Kd &amp; 50 Kd proteins were labeled with fluorescent alkyne probe as above in a background of either 100, 50, 25, or 0 \u00b5g of control Jurkat lysate (left panel). Note: 100 \u00b5g of control lysate was added after labeling to the '0 lysate' to facilitate recovery of the labeled protein by precipitation. The gel was post stained with SYPRO\u00ae Ruby total protein stain. See Figure 8.</p>Example 8: Enzymatic Labeling and Detection of \u03b1-crystallin O-GlcNAc\u03b1-crystallin O-GlcNAc was enzymatically labeled with azide (UDP-GalNAz) using a modified b-Ga1T1 enzyme. The protein was subsequently reacted with a fluorescent alkyne probe as described. The proteins were run on 1-D NuPAGE\u00ae Novex\u00ae 4-12% gels at the dilutions shown. Note: Only 2-10 % of \u03b1-crystallin is O-GlcNAc-modified and therefore the detection sensitivity of the O-GlcNAc moiety is in the mid-to-low femtomole range (10-45 fmols). See figure 9.</p>Example 9: Comparison of GalT1 Enzyme Labeling with a-O-GlcNAc Monoclonal Antibody CTD 110.6In A., \u03b1-crystallin O-GlcNAc was enzymatically labeled with the modified Ga1T1 enzyme and subsequently reacted with a biotin-alkyne probe. The proteins were run on 1-D NuPAGE\u00ae Novex\u00ae 4-12% Bis-Tris gels, at the dilutions shown, and blotted onto PVDF membrane. The PVDF membrane was then incubated in streptavidin-HRP and proteins were detected using ECL Plus\u2122 (GE Biosystems). Lane 2 (NE) represents the 8 pmoL no-enzyme added control. Note: In A, the detection sensitivity of O-GlcNAc by Western blot is in the low fe"
