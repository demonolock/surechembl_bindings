{"raw_mentions": "High affinity refers to a ligand that binds to an antibody having an affinity constant (K<sub>a</sub>) greater than 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>, typically 10<sup>5</sup>-10<sup>11</sup> m<sup>-1</sup>; as determined by inhibition ELISA or an equivalent affinity determined by comparable techniques such as, for example, Scatchard plots or using K<sub>d</sub>/dissociation constant, which is the reciprocal of the K<sub>a</sub>."}
