    "d geldanamycin analogs and may be used for all known therapeutic indications that 17-amino substituted geldanamycin analogs are useful in treating. 17-amino substituted geldanamycin analogs, and in particular 17-AAG, are highly potent and selective inhibitors of HSP90.</p>The present invention further provides a compound for use in treating, ameliorating one or more of the symptoms of, and reducing the severity of hyperpoliferative disorders, ie cancer, as well as other HSP90 mediated disorders or conditions. Since the compositions of the present invention are more soluble than the oxidized benzoquinone forms, the compositions are more easily administered resulting in better clinical outcomes for any of the known uses of the parent molecules.</p>The methods of treatment involve administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention to a subject suffering from an HSP90 mediated disorder or condition, such as cancer. Descriptions of the compositions, formulations, dosing, modes of administration and treatment are described herein.</p>Certain 17-amino substituted analogs of geldanamycin have been synthesized, and their use as antitumor agents is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,261,989</patcit> and 5,387,584</patcit>, 5,932,566</patcit> and published PCT applications WO 00/03737</patcit> and WO 03/072794</patcit>. Structure activity relationships of 17-amino substituted geldanamycin analogs have shed more light on the chemical features required for inhibition of HSP90 (See, e.g., J. Med. Chem. (1995) 38:3806-3812, J. Med. Chem. (1995) 38:3813-3820, and Clin. Cancer Res. (1999) 5:3781).</p>Among the more successful 17-amino substituted geldamaycin analogs is 17-AAG, which has shown broad antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo and is currently in multiple phase I/II clinical trials. 17-AAG exhibits differential cytoxicity against a broad range of tumor types in the NCI 60 tumor cell line panel. The mean IC<sub>50</sub> over all cell lines in the panel is 120 nM (Developmental Therapeutics Program Website: http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/, mean graph for compound S330507).</p>In addition, 17-AAG has been shown to have activity against a number of cell lines, including, but not limited to, melanoma (Anti-Cancer Drugs (2004) 15: 377-388), prostate cancer (Clin. Cancer Res. (2002) 8: 986-993), breast cancer (Cancer. Res. (2001) 61: 2945-2952), non-small cell lung cancer (Ann. Thorac. Surg. (2000) 70: 1853-1860), leukemias (Cancer Res. (2001) 61: 1799-1804), and colon cancer (J. Natl. Cancer Inst. (2003) 95: 1624-1633).</p>In one embodiment, the present invention provides a compound for use in treating cancer, comprising administering to a mammal in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of anyone of the aforementioned compounds; or a therapeutically effective amount of anyone of the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions.</p>In one embodiment, the present invention relates to the aforementioned method, wherein said cance"
