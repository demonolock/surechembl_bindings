    "ife activities of the body. Meanwhile, pain is a common clinical symptom, and after external stimulation causing pain disappears, strong or persistent pain causes physiological dysfunction, and the life quality of a living body is seriously affected. Statistics show that about one fifth of the world's population suffers from moderate to severe chronic pain.</p>Pain originates in nociceptors of the peripheral nervous system. This is a free nerve terminal, widely distributed in the skin, muscle, joint and visceral tissues throughout the body, which can convert the sensed thermal, mechanical or chemical stimulus into nerve impulses (action potentials) and transmit them via afferent nerve fibers to its somatic parts located in the Dorsal Root Ganglia (DRGs) and finally to the higher nerve centers, causing pain sensation. The generation and conduction of action potentials in neurons, in turn, depend on voltage-gated sodium channels (Na) on the cell membrane<sub>V</sub>). When the cell membrane depolarizes, the sodium ion channel is activated, the channel opens, causing sodium ion influx, which further depolarizes the cell membrane, resulting in the generation of an action potential. Therefore, inhibition of aberrant sodium channel activity contributes to the treatment, relief of pain.</p>Na      <sub>V</sub>Is a kind of transmembrane ion channel protein. These proteins consist of an alpha subunit with a molecular weight of 260kD and a beta subunit with a molecular weight of 30-40 kD. Can be divided into 9 subtypes according to the difference of alpha subunit, Na<sub>V</sub>l.l\uff5eNa      <sub>V</sub>1.9. Different subtypes exhibit different tissue distribution and electrophysiological, pharmacological characteristics (Rush a.m., et al.j.physiol.2007,579, 1-14.). Sodium ion channels are classified as TTX-sensitive (TTX-S) and TTX-insensitive (TTX-R) depending on whether they are effectively inhibited by nanomolar tetrodotoxin (TTX). Wherein, Na<sub>V</sub>1.1\u3001Na      <sub>V</sub>1.2\u3001Na      <sub>V</sub>1.3 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 is TTX-S type, and the coding gene is located on human chromosome 2q23-24, which are abundantly expressed in neurons. Na (Na)<sub>V</sub>1.5\u3001Na      <sub>V</sub>1.8 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.9 is TTX-R type, and the coding gene is located on human chromosome 3p 21-24. Wherein, Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 is mainly present in cardiac myocytes, Na<sub>V</sub> 1.8\u3001Na      <sub>V</sub>l.9 are present in the peripheral nervous system (Goldin A. L., et al. Annu. Rev. Physiol.2001,63, 871-894.). Na (Na)<sub>V</sub>1.4 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 are all TTX-S type, abundant in skeletal muscle and central nervous system, respectively (Fozzard H.A., et al. Physiol.Rev.1996,76, 887-. Local anesthetic lidocaine by inhibiting Na<sub>V</sub>To relieve pain. But not selective Na<sub>V</sub>Inhibitors such as lamotrigine, lacosamide, mexiletine have been used successfully to treat chronic pain.</p>Na      <sub>V</sub>1.8 is TTX-R type, and the coding gene is SCN10A, m"
