    "). The column is then washed at the same flow rate keeping the buffer mixture composition constant until the absorbance reading at 280 nm has reached baseline level, followed by a linear gradient over 20 minutes starting upon injection at the equilibration conditions and ending with a mixture of 50% buffer A/50% buffer B. Dimeric biologically active TGF-\u03b22 is eluted 9 minutes after the start of the gradient and collected manually. As judged by biological activity determination, SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions and RP-HPLC no dimeric TGF-\u03b22 was found in the flow through fraction. Additionally, no monomeric TGF-\u03b22 was detected by SDS-PAGE in the dimeric TGF-\u03b22 peak eluted from the column by the salt gradient.</p>I. Further purification of dimeric TGF-\u03b22Dimeric TGF-\u03b22 from example 4.G is diluted with the same volume of 0.1% TFA in water and subjected to RP-HPLC on a Vydac 214TP5415 column (4.6 \u00d7 150 mm, The Separations Group, USA) equilibrated in a mixture of 80% TFA 0.1% in water and 20% TFA 0.08% in acetonitrile. The column is eluted by a linear gradient over 40 min starting upon injection at the equilibration conditions and ending with a mixture of 60% TFA 0.1% in water and 40% TFA 0.08% in acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The eluate is monitored for absorbance at 216 nm. TGF-\u03b22 is eluted with a retention time of 32.7 min and collected manually. SDS-PAGE analysis under non reducing conditions revealed a single sharp band of apparent molecular weight of about 25 kD. The obtained dimeric TGF-\u03b22 is of high purity.</p>J. Alternative method I for the generation of dimeric, biologically active TGF-\u03b22Monomeric TGF-\u03b22 from example 4.B is dissolved at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 2M NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM cysteine, 1 mM cystine and 50 mM Chaps (Calbiochem). After 300 hours at 4\u00b0C the pH is adjusted to pH 2.5 with 10% TFA. Then 30 mg/ml of Sepralyte C-1 (preparative grade, 40 \u00b5m, Analytichem International, Harbor City, CA, USA), pretreated sequentially with 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA in water, is added and the mixture is gently stirred for 30 min at room temperature. The gel is filtered over a glass frit covered with fresh prewashed Sepralyte C-1 (20% the amount added to the refolding solution). The gel is washed first with (5 times the gel volume) buffer A (0.2 M NaCl/0.1%TFA/water), then with a mixture of 80% buffer A and 20% buffer B (0.08% TFA in acetonitrile). TGF-\u03b22 is eluted with a mixture of 70% buffer A and 30% buffer B. The eluate is applied directly onto a Mono S column HR 5/5 (Pharmacia). Purification and isolation of TGF-\u03b22 is performed as in examples 4.H and 4.I, respectively.</p>Alternatively, acetonitrile in buffer A and buffer B, respectively, used for washing the Sepralyte C-1 gel and elution of TGF-\u03b22 is replaced by isopropanol. Washing is then performed with a mixture of 90% buffer A and 10% buffer B and elution of TGF-\u03b22 is achieved with a stepwise gradient (steps of 2% buffe"
