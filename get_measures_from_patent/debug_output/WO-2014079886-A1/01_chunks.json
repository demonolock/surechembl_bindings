    "ens. Affinity for Ag2 may not be measurable if the binding response is too low. In the present application, a monoclonal antibody binding to Ag1 is not significantly cross-reactive to Ag2, when the binding response of the monoclonal antibody to Ag2 is less than 5% of the binding response of the same monoclonal antibody to Ag1 in the same experimental setting and at the same antibody concentration. In practice, the antibody concentration used \n\n can be the EC<sub>50</sub> or the concentration required to reach the saturation plateau obtained with Ag1. </p> A monoclonal antibody \"binds specifically\" to, or \"is specific for\" Ag1 when it is not significantly cross-reactive to Ag2. Accordingly, the antibody according to the invention has a ratio of affinity for human CEACAM5 to the affinity for Macaca fascicularis CEACAM5 which is &lt;10, for instance &lt;5, &lt;2, &lt;1 , or &lt;0.5. Thus, the polypeptide according to the invention may be used in toxicological studies performed in monkeys because the toxicity profile observed in monkeys would be relevant to anticipate potential adverse effects in humans </p> An embodiment of the invention has an affinity for human CEACAM5 or Macaca fascicularis CEACAM5, or both, which is &lt;10nM, for instance &lt; 5nM, &lt; 3nM, &lt; 1 nM or &lt; 0.1 nM, for instance an affinity of 0.01 nM to 5 nM, or and affinity of 0.1 nM to 5 nM, or of 0.1 nM to 1 nM. </p> Affinity for human CEACAM5 or for Macaca fascicularis CEACAM5 may be determined as the EC50 value in an ELISA using soluble recombinant CEACAM5 as capture antigen. </p> The antibody of the invention may also have an apparent dissociation constant (apparent KD), as may be determined by FACS analysis on tumor cell line MKN45 (DSMZ, ACC 409) or on xenograft tumor cells deriving from patient (CR-IGR-034P available from Oncodesign Biotechnology, tumor collection CReMEC), which is &lt;25nM, for instance &lt;20nM, &lt;10nM, &lt;5nM, &lt;3nM or &lt;1 nM. The apparent KD may be within the range 0.01 -20 nM, or may be within the range 0.1 -20nM, 0.1 -10nM, or 0.1 - 5nM. </p> Additionally, antibodies according to the invention have been shown to be able to detect CEACAM5 expression by immunohistochemistry in frozen and formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue sections. </p>Alignments of the sequences of the VH and VL regions of the MAb1 , MAb2, MAb3, MAb4 and MAb5 antibodies are shown in Figure 7. The comparison of the CRD-H and CDR-L sequences indicates that, structurally, MAb2, MAb4 and MAb5, on one hand, and MAb1 and MAb3, on the other hand, are closely related, said antibodies probably binding to the same epitope. The comparison of the CRD-H and CDR-L sequences further identifies CDR positions that are strictly conserved between the two groups of antibodies and which are thus assumed to be important for \n\n specificity, whereas other positions could support substitution. </p> It has been further identified by the inventors that residues at positions 101 -109 of MAb2 VH (i.e. residues of CDR3-H) and residues at positions 47-54 and 88-104 of MAb2 VL (i.e. regions including CDR2-L and CDR3-L, respectively) make part, or form, the antibody paratope for human CEACAM5-A3B3 domain. </p> Furthermore, residues at positions 27, 28, 29, 31 , 51 , 52, 89, 90, 93, 94, 96, and 97 of MAb2 VL (i.e. within CDR1 -L, CDR2-L and CDR3-L), and residues at positions 26 to 31 , 51 to 58, 97, 103, 104, 107, and 109 of MAb2 VH (i.e. within CDR1 -H, all o",
