    "the antigen binding fragment prevents or inhibits binding of one or more CCR8 ligands to the CCR8 receptor, thereby interrupting the biological response that would otherwise result from ligand binding to the receptor. In certain embodiments, the antigen binding fragment specifically binds to CCR8 and/or inhibits or modulates the biological activity of CCR 8.</p><p id=\"p0067\" num=\"0062\">The term \"antigen\" refers to a molecule or portion of a molecule that is capable of being bound by a selective binding agent (such as an antibody) and that is otherwise capable of being used in an animal to produce an antibody that is capable of binding to an epitope of the antigen. An antigen may have one or more epitopes.</p><p id=\"p0068\" num=\"0063\">The term \"epitope\" includes any determinant, preferably a polypeptide determinant, capable of specific binding to an immunoglobulin or T cell receptor. An epitope is the region of an antigen that is bound by an antibody. In certain embodiments, epitope determinants include chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids, sugar side chains, phosphoryl groups, or sulfonyl groups, and may have specific three dimensional structural characteristics and/or specific charge characteristics in certain embodiments. In certain embodiments, an antibody specifically binds an antigen when it preferentially recognizes its target antigen in a complex mixture of proteins and/or macromolecules. According to certain embodiments, the equilibrium dissociation constant at antibody-antigen binding is less than or equal to 10  <sup>-6</sup> M or less than or equal to 10 <sup>-7</sup> M orLess than or equal to 10 <sup>-8</sup> At M, the antibody can be said to specifically bind to the antigen. In some embodiments, the equilibrium dissociation constant may be less than or equal to 10 <sup>-</sup><sup>9</sup> M or less than or equal to 10 <sup>-10</sup> M\u3002</p><p id=\"p0069\" num=\"0064\">The term \"vector\" is used to refer to any molecule (e.g., nucleic acid, plasmid, or virus) that is used to transfer the encoded information into a host cell. The term \"expression vector\" refers to a vector suitable for transforming a host cell and containing a nucleic acid sequence that directs and/or controls the expression of an inserted heterologous nucleic acid sequence. Expression includes, but is not limited to, processes such as transcription, translation, and RNA splicing (if introns are present).</p><p id=\"p0070\" num=\"0065\">C-C motif chemokine receptor 8 (CCR 8)</p><p id=\"p0071\" num=\"0066\">CCR8 (also previously known as Cy6, CKR-L1 or TER 1) is a G protein-coupled 7-pass transmembrane CC chemokine receptor protein expressed in thymus, spleen, etc. The gene encoding this protein is located on human chromosome 3p 21. \"human CCR8\" consists of 355 amino acids, and its amino acid sequence is shown in SEQ ID NO. 1.
