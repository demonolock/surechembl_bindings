Reaction mixture was stirred for 48 h at 140\u00b0 C. and then cooled to room temperature. Mixture was filtered through a short silica plug and washed with EtOAC. Crude obtained was washed with NaHCO<sub>3 </sub>and extracted with EtOAC (2\u00d710 mL). Combined organic phase was dried (MgSO<sub>4</sub>), followed by purification using silica gel chromatography on Combiflash R<sub>f </sub>200 by employing hexane-EtOAC step gradient (95:5\u219280:20) over 30 min. Fractions corresponding to the product peak were combined and concentrated using rotavap to afford the desired compound.</p>Radioligand-Receptor Binding Assays (Agonist Radioligand).</p>Isolation of membranes from permanently transfected HEK293 cells expressing tCRFR1 or hCRFR1 and Scatchard analysis were performed with 50-100 ng protein as described (3) except that 50 pM [<sup>125</sup>I]Tyr-sauvagine (NEN) was used as radioligand. [<sup>125</sup>I]Tyr-Sauvagine was chosen as radioligand because of its equal high affinity for both CRF-R1 and CRF-R2. Nonspecific binding was always defined as residual [<sup>125</sup>I]Tyr-sauvagine binding in the presence of 1 \u03bcM unlabeled ligand. The dissociation constant, K<sub>D</sub>, was calculated by the Ligand program (Munson et al. (1980) Anal. Biochem. 107: 220).</p>Radioligand Receptor Binding Assay of Cloned Receptor (Antagonist Effect).</p>COS-M6 cells were transfected with 10-20 ng of plasmid DNA, and after two days cells were washed with HDB and detached by incubation with 0.5 mM EDTA in HDB for 15 min at 21\u00b0 C. The cells were washed twice with HDB and homogenized in 5% sucrose. The homogenate was centrifuged at 600\u00d7g for 5 min, after which the supernatant was centrifuged at 40,000\u00d7g for 20 min. The resulting membrane homogenate, P2, was resuspended at 1-4 mg/ml in 10% sucrose and used in the binding assay (Perrin et al. (1986) Endrocrinology, 118: 11715). Dissociation constants were calculated from relative potencies by using the ALLFIT program (DeLean et al. (1978) Am. J. Physiol. 235: E97) and determined from competitive displacement assays with rat/human CRF (r/hCRF) as the standard.</p>Receptor Binding, Inhibition, and Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeability Assay (PAMPA).</p>Agilent 1260 infinity high-performance liquid chromatography system was used for analysis. The analytical column used was an IAM.PC.DD.2 column (4.6 mm i.d.\u00d710 cm length, particle size 10 pm, pore size 300 \u212b) purchased from Regis Technologies (Morton Grove, Ill.). The mobile phase was a mixture of acetonitrile and water (35:65 v/v). The flow rate of the mobile phase was maintained at 1.0 ml/min at 25\u00b0 C., and the ultraviolet absorption wavelength was set at 254 nm. Analysis was performed using 5 \u03bcL injection of the 2 mM stock solutions of the compounds. Compounds with k<sub>IAM </sub>values &gt;1 in the PAMPA assay in our hands are indicative of good brain permeability.</p>Initial results of the receptor binding study are shown in Table 4.

T41 had the best CRFR1 binding (see Table 4, above) with a Kd\u02dc15 nM (done at CEREP). T41 gave 70% inhibition of CRFR1 CAMP signaling (\u201cCRF1 antagonist effect\u201d) at 1 \u03bcM upon CRF binding, with a K<sub>I </sub>of 400 nM. T41 was also tested in the Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeability Assay (PAMPA) for its potential to be brain penetrant (cross the blood-brain barrier, BBB), and this compound gave a relatively good KW of \u02dc4.</p>TABLE 5Compounds tested in receptor binding study.<img id=\"EMI-C00050\" path=\"US11077108-20210803-C00050.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/859675716/US/20210803/B2/000011/07/71/08/US11077108-20210803-C00050.TIF\"/>T33 <img id=\"EMI-C00051\" path=\"US11077108-20210803-C00051.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/859675788/US/20210803/B2/000011/07/71/08/US11077108-20210803-C00051.TIF\"/>T36 <img id=\"EMI-C00052\" path=\"US11077108-20210803-C00052.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/859675745/US/20210803/B2/000011/07/71/08/US11077108-20210803-C00052.TIF\"/>T37 <img id=\"EMI-C00053\" path=\"US11077108-20210803-C00053.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/859675749/US/20210803/B2/000011/07/71/08/US11077108-20210803-C00053.TIF\"/>T38 <img id=\"EMI-C00054\" path=\"US11077108-20210803-C00054.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/859675644/US/20210803/B2/000011/07/71/08/US11077108-20210803-C00054.TIF\"/>T39 <img id=\"EMI-C00055\" path=\"US11077108-20210803-C00055.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/859675742/US/20210803/B2/0"
