    "he method comprises contacting a solution of a protein or peptide with an enzyme that cleaves the two N-terminal or the two C-terminal amino acids of the protein or peptide under conditions effective to produce a diketopiperazine.</p>The invention also provides an improved pharmaceutical composition of a protein or peptide. The improvement is that the composition comprises a decreased content of diketopiperazines.</p>In addition, the invention provides a method of making an improved pharmaceutical composition of a protein or peptide. The method comprises removing from the composition at least some of the diketopiperazines present in the composition.</p>The invention further provides a method of making an improved pharmaceutical composition of a protein or peptide. The method comprises treating a solution of the protein or peptide so as to increase the content of diketopiperazines in the composition.</p>The invention also provides an improved pharmaceutical composition of a protein or peptide. The improvement is that the composition comprises an increased content of diketopiperazines.</p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSFIG. 1. Tracings of counts versus concentration of ERK1/2 for TriPS cells (CD4+ T-cell line isolated from influenza-immunized donor which is specific for hemagglutinin) isolated on day 20 after stimulation with anti-CD3 OKT3 antibody and incubated with 25 ng phorbal myristic acid (PMA), HC-RBL (fraction of heated human colostrum of molecular weight less than 3 kD and containing MR-DKP) at a 1:10 dilution and 0.5 mM DA-DKP for 15 minutes at 37\u00b0 C.</p>FIG. 2. Bar graph showing inhibition of secretion of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) and IL-16 from TriPS cells 12 days after stimulation with anti-CD3 OKT3 antibody. Indicates the inhibition of both TNF\u03b1 and IL-16 secretion by human colostrum (HC) 2626 (containing MR-DKP) band DA-DKP. The maximal release observed using HC 2626 at 1:100 and 1:1000 dilutions is due to the lytic effect of high concentrations of human colostrum. No lysis is observed using 0.5 mM DA-DKP, and TNF\u03b1 and IL-16 secretion are decreased.</p>FIG. 3. Bar graph showing inhibition of TNF\u03b1 secretion from TriPS cells 10 days after stimulation with anti-CD3 OKT3 antibody. Indicates that HC RBL and DA-DKP need to be investigated further for titratable response as seen with HC 2626. May indicated a potent activity.</p>FIG. 4. Bar graph showing inhibition of TNF\u03b1 secretion from TriPS cells at varying times after stimulation with anti-CD3 OKT3 antibody. Indicates that early in the stimulation cycle, the effect of DA-DKP and HC RBL is inhibitory, while later in the cycle (day 14) the effect is stimulatory. HC 2626 inhibits at all times, presumably due to other constituents.</p>FIG. 5. Bar graph showing inhibition of TNF\u03b1 secretion from H4#9.25 cells (CD4+ T-cell line isolated from autopsy brain tissue of a multiple sclerosis patient which is specific for myelin basic protein) on day 7-10 after stimulation with anti-CD3 OKT3 an"
