    "absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion), efficacy expression), and thus it is extremely useful as a medicament.</p>Compound (I) and a prodrug thereof (hereinafter to be sometimes abbreviated as the compound of the present invention) have a GIP receptor activating action.</p>The compounds of the present invention have a high GIP receptor selective activation action in vivo.</p>GIP is a gastrointestinal hormone called incretin and has a promoting action on insulin secretion from the pancreas. Incretin is closely related to glucose metabolism and thus the compound having a GIP receptor activation action is useful for preventing and treating symptoms related to abnormal glucose metabolism including diabetes and obesity. Additionally, the compounds of the present invention have a GIP receptor selective activation action and suppress vomiting by activating GABAergic neurons in the area postrema.</p>More specifically, the compounds of the present invention have a hypoglycemic action, an antiemetic action, and the like.</p>The compounds of the present invention have a high chemical stability and excellent persistence of the effects in vivo.</p>The compounds of the present invention may be used as a GIP receptor activator.</p>In the present invention, the GIP receptor activator (GIP receptor agonist) means an agent having a GIP receptor activation action. Additionally, the GIP receptor selective activator (GIP receptor selective agonist) specifically means an agent having an EC50 for the GIP receptor of 1/1000 or less, and preferably 1/10000 or less, times the EC50 for the GLP-1 receptor.</p>The compound of the present invention is low in its toxicity (e.g., acute toxicity, chronic toxicity, genetic toxicity, reproductive toxicity, cardiac toxicity, carcinogenicity), shows a few side effects, and can be safely administered to a mammal (e.g., human, bovine, horse, dog, cat, monkey, mouse, rat) as an agent for the prophylaxis or treatment of various diseases mentioned below and the like.</p>The compound of the present invention can be used as an agent for the treatment or prophylaxis of various diseases including diabetes and obesity, by virtue of the above-mentioned activating action on GIP receptors. The compound of the present invention can be used as an agent for the prophylaxis or treatment of, for example, symptomatic obesity, obesity based on simple obesity, disease state or disease associated with obesity, eating disorder, diabetes (e.g., type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes, obese diabetes), hyperlipidemia (e.g., hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, high LDL-cholesterolemia, low HDL-cholesterolemia, postprandial hyperlipemia), hypertension, cardiac failure, diabetic complications [e.g., neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, diabetic cardiomyopathy, cataract, macroangiopathy, osteopenia, hyperosmolar diabetic coma, infectious disease (e.g., respiratory infection, urinary tract infection, gastrointestinal infection, dermal soft tissue infections, inferior limb infection), diabetic gangrene, xerostomia,"
