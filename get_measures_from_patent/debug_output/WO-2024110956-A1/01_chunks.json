    "onstrated by the phosphorylation of RIPK3 and MLKL, and the inhibition of caspase 8. Of note, other antibodies targeting different epitopes in EMMPRIN did not induce cell death in similar conditions. Necroptosis is initiated by several receptors, including death receptors such as TNFRI or inflammatory receptors such as TLRs <sup>59</sup>. Without wishing to be bound to any mechanism of action, it is suggested that EMMPRIN may be one of these receptors, and that the specific signaling that initiates necroptosis is triggered by the binding of hMR18-mAb to this specific epitope. Additionally, the gradual change in the TME from immune-suppressive to immune- permissive, allows over time for other immune cells, such as CD8+ T lymphocytes to infiltrate the tumor and enhance the anti-tumoral response even further. Thus, the hMR18-mAb of the present invention triggers a cascade of events that eventually contribute to the inhibition of the primary tumor. </p><p id=\"p0185\" num=\"0185\">EMMPRIN expression is elevated in metastatic cells, and it is involved in multiple functions, including angiogenesis, proliferation, leukocyte recruitment, EMT, and invasiveness, that are all associated with and contribute to metastasis. </p><p id=\"p0186\" num=\"0186\">It is demonstrated that the hMR18-mAb can disrupt or reduce some of these activities, and therefore reduce metastasis. Looking at the lungs as an example of a metastatic organ, the hMR18-mAb reduced the rate of proliferation, as assessed by the Ki-67 mRNA expression, as well as the concentrations of the pro-angiogenic factors VEGF and MMP-9. Interestingly, the hMR18-mAb inhibited the mRNA expression of the known EMT markers Snail and Twist- 1, and elevated the dormancy markers SOX2 and p21. Therefore, it is proposed that hMR18-mAb has a dual role in inhibiting metastasis by inhibiting the EMT process on the one hand and simultaneously by pushing tumor cells towards dormancy. This combined action inhibits the \n<!-- EPO <DP n=\"33\"/>-->\nmetastatic outbreak at the metastatic site, and may be of crucial importance in the effort to control against metastasis after initial treatment by surgery or chemotherapy. </p><p id=\"p0187\" num=\"0187\">The finding of the present invention, that EMMPRIN regulates anti-angiogenic factors, specifically endostatin, emphasizes the key role EMMPRIN has during angiogenesis. Furthermore, its ability to act as an allosteric regulator that enhances the synergistic ability of MMP-9 and in a hormetic manner the ability of proteasome 20S to cleave C0II8A to produce endostatin, as well as the ability of the antibodies of the present invention to inhibit these responses, may open the door to new therapeutic targets and avenues in the future. </p><p id=\"p0188\" num=\"0188\">In the following description, certain specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of various embodiments.

Kd can be measured by any suitable assay. In certain embodiments, Kd can be measured using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays (e.g., using, for example a BIACORE\u00ae-2000 or a BIACORE\u00ae-3000). In other embodiments, Kd values are calculated by cell-based ELISA. </p><p id=\"p0210\" num=\"0210\">In pharmaceutical and medicament formulations, the active agent is preferably utilized together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carrier(s) and optionally any other therapeutic ingredients. The carrier(s) must be pharmaceutically acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not unduly deleterious to the recipient thereof.

    "other epithelial cells in normal tissues (e.g., colon, kidney) and other cell types (e.g., endothelial cells, fibroblasts, immune cells, and cardiomyocytes) <sup>3</sup>-<sup>46</sup>-<sup>47</sup>. Recognition of EMMPRIN in normal tissue by the hMR18-mAb may limit the antibody\u2019s usefulness as a therapeutic agent.</p><p id=\"p0268\" num=\"0268\">In the first approach, tissue sections were immunohistochemically stained with the monoclonal anti-human EMMPRIN antibody (hMR18-mAb). First, tumor tissues obtained from BALB/c mice injected with the RENCA mouse renal carcinoma cells, and normal tissues of the kidney and colon from the same mice were stained either with the hMR18-mAb or with \n<!-- EPO <DP n=\"53\"/>-->\na commercial anti-EMMPIN antibody (Abeam). The commercial antibody stained all three tissues, whereas the hMR18-mAb stained mostly the tumor tissue (Figure 3A). While the hMR18-mAb and the commercial antibody demonstrated similar intensity in the staining of the tumor tissue, the staining of the colon and kidney tissues was 10-fold stronger with the commercial antibody than with the hMR18-mAb. Additionally, sections from human colon carcinoma and its adjacent normal colon tissue were stained (Figure 3B). Again, the commercial antibody stained both tissues strongly, whereas the hMR18-mAb demonstrated similar intensity of the tumor tissue staining but reduced staining (by 8-fold) of the normal tissue. </p><p id=\"p0269\" num=\"0269\">The second approach was to evaluate the binding dissociation constant (Kd) of the antibody to human EMMPRIN. Usually, Kd values for antibodies are measured using Surface plasmon resonance (SPR), which is a sensitive method that exhibits Kd values in the ranges of 10'<sup>9</sup>-10<sup>_11</sup> M. However, a large amount of the purified EMMPRIN protein is required for SPR analysis, and this protein is produced in cell lines, which are cancerous by definition. Since we just wanted to show that there is a difference in the antibodies\u2019 recognition of tumor cells vs. healthy cells, we turned to the method of cell-based ELISA. The Kd values of the hMR18-mAb to the EMMPRIN protein expressed on human cancer cells (the renal carcinoma A498 and breast carcinoma MDA-MB-231 cell lines) were compared with its Kd values to the EMMPRIN protein expressed on the human primary fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) obtained from a joint of a RA patient. Using Sctachard plots, it is shown that the Kd of the hMR18-mAb to the EMMPRIN protein expressed on cancer cells is two order of magnitude lower than its Kd to the normal FLS cells (Figure 4A, Kd=5.9xlO'<sup>5</sup>pM (10'<sup>11</sup> M) or 6.4xl0'<sup>5</sup> pM (10'<sup>11</sup> M) for MDA- MB-231 and A498 cells, respectively, relative to Kd=5.4xl0'<sup>3</sup> pM (10\u2018<sup>9</sup> M) for the FLS cells). In comparison, a commercial anti-EMMPRIN antibody (from Biolegend), showed the same range of Kd values (Kd=1.3-1.9xl0\u2018<sup>4</sup> pM (IO'<sup>10</sup> M) for all cells used, including the non- cancerous cells (Figure 4B). </p><p id=\"p0270\" num=\"0270\">In summary, the monoclonal antibody (hMR18-mAb) specifically recognizes EMMRPIN in tumor cells with higher affinity compared to normal cells. Without wishing to be bound to any mechanism of action, it is proposed that a difference in the EMMPRIN protein exists between the cancer and normal cells. This represents a clear advantage of the monoclonal antibody of the present invention over commercial and other antibodies to the same target. \n<!-- EPO <DP n=\"54\"/>-->\nExample 4. The human anti-EMMPRIN antibodies induce necroptosis - a new mechanism of action. </p><p id=\"p0271\" num=\"0271\">It was previously demonstrated that the mouse polyclonal anti-EMMPRIN antibody (ml61- pAb) induces necroptosis in the mouse colon and renal carcinoma cells lines (CT26 and RENCA), which in response, secrete dsRNA that is taken up by macrophages and induces a shift in their polarization from M2-like activation to Ml -like activation. This type of cell death was validated by the increased phosphorylation of RIPK3 and LMLKL, by the inhibition of caspase-8 activity, and by the use of the RIPK1 inhibitor Nec-1 that aborted tumor cell death. The necessity of the dsRNA as a DAMP that alleviates the immune suppression in the TME was demonstrated before in vitro <sup>43</sup>. </p><p id=\"p0272\" num=\"0272\">To demonstrate that this induction of necroptosis also oc",
    "ing and generating a metastatic lesion <sup>50,5 J</sup>. However, the conditions that give rise to such an onset of proliferation, or alternatively, to the continued dormant state, are not yet understood. We propose that EMMPRIN, which mediates processes that are all linked to EMT/MET, such as proliferation, migration and angiogenesis, participates in this determination, and that the antibodies of the present invention, directed against the specific human EMMPRIN epitope can revert this determination and keep cells in a dormant state. \n<!-- EPO <DP n=\"56\"/>-->\n To demonstrate that the hMR18-mAb can reduce the metastatic cascade and push cells towards dormancy, the MDA-MB-231 metastatic cell line was injected orthotopically to the mammary fat pad of female mice, and hMR18-mAb or the irrelevant Rabbit IgG that served as a negative control (15 g each) were injected to the peritoneum of the mice when tumors were about 150 mm<sup>3</sup> in volume. Macro-metastases were defined as lesions with an area of &gt;1,000 pm<sup>2</sup>, and micro-metastases with lesions with an area &lt;1,000 pm<sup>2 52</sup>). While the control group presented with large metastatic lesions that had a mean area exceeding 1,000 pm<sup>2</sup>, the group treated with hMR18-mAb exhibited a reduced number of metastases with an average area of about only 250 pm<sup>2</sup> (Figure 7). </p><p id=\"p0277\" num=\"0277\">Additionally, the hMR18-mAb inhibited the proliferation of the tumor cells, as assessed by the Ki-67 mRNA expression (Figure 8A), and reduced the tissue levels of the pro-angiogenic factors VEGF and MMP-9 (Figures 8B, 8C). In contrast, the tissue levels of IFNP were increased, suggesting that necroptosis took place in this model of MDA-MB-231 cells. The mRNA expression of the known EMT marker Snail and Twist- 1 were reduced by hMR18-mAb, whereas those of the dormancy markers SOX2 and p21 were increased (Figures 8E-8H).</p><p id=\"p0278\" num=\"0278\">In summary: The hMR18-mAb can reduce the number of lung metastases and decrease their size. This is carried out simultaneously in several mechanisms, including the reduction in the rate of tumor cell proliferation, the inhibition of angiogenesis due to reduced levels of pro- angiogenic factors, and the ability of hR18-mAb to inhibit the EMT process as well as push the tumor cells towards dormancy. Thus, we propose that treatment with the hMR18-mAb can inhibit or prevent the metastatic outbreak, keeping the tumor cells in the remote organ in a dormant state. </p><p id=\"p0279\" num=\"0279\">Example 6.
