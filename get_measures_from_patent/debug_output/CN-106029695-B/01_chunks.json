    "lls expressing canine PD-1 were cultured to 80-100% confluence in 50 \u03bc l medium (DMEM/HAM's F12, 10% FBS). Next, 50 \u03bc l of the medium containing different concentrations of purified mAb was added and held at 37 \u2103 for 1 hour. After 3 washes with PBS-tween, 100 \u03bc l of goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP) diluted 1:1000 in culture medium was added and held at 37 \u2103 for 1 hour. After washing 3 more times with PBS-tween, bound mAb was visualized with peroxidase substrate (TMB). The increase in absorbance at 450 nm due to peroxidase activity was measured in a microplate reader.</p>Binding studies of mouse anti-canine PD-1 mAb and caninized mouse anti-canine PD-1 mAb to canine PD-1</p>Approximately 70 Resonance Units (RU) of canine PD-1 antigen were directly immobilized by amine coupling.
