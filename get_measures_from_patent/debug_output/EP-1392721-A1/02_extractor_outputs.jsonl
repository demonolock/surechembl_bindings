{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nIn this assay the NS3 protease domain (residues 1027-1206 of the HCV polyprotein) complexed to a modified form of the NS4A peptide, spanning residues 21-34 of the NS4A cofactor in addition to a solubilizing lys-tag, Pep 4AK [KKKGSWIVGRIILSGR(NH<sub>2</sub>) ] were used. \n Buffer solutions were preincubated for 10 min with 10-200 nM protease and reactions were started by addition of 10 \u03bcM substrate. \nIncubation times at 23 \u00b0C were adjusted to obtain &lt;10% conversion. \nReactions were stopped by the addition of 40 \u03bcl of 1% TFA. \n80 \u03bcl samples were injected on a Lichrospher C18 reversed phase cartridge column (4 x 74mm, 5\u03bcm, Merck) and fragments were separated using a -10-40 % acetonitrile gradient at 5%/min using a flow rate of 2.5ml/min. \nIncubation times were chosen in order to obtain <sub>&lt;</sub>7% substrate conversion and reactions were stopped by addition of 40 \u03bcl 1 % TFA. \nTo this assay mix 10 \u03bcM (final concentration) of a peptide substrate corresponding to the NS5AB cleavage site and having the sequence H-EAGDDIVPCSMSYTWTGA-OH, were added."}
