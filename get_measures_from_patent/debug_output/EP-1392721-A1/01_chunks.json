    " To this assay mix 10 \u03bcM (final concentration) of a peptide substrate corresponding to the NS5AB cleavage site and having the sequence H-EAGDDIVPCSMSYTWTGA-OH, were added. Incubation times at 23 \u00b0C were adjusted to obtain &lt;10% conversion. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 40 \u03bcl of 1% TFA. Cleavage was determined by HPLC using a Merck- Hitachi chromatograph equipped with an autosampler. 80 \u03bcl samples were injected on a Lichrospher C18 reversed phase cartridge column (4 x 74mm, 5\u03bcm, Merck) and fragments were separated using a -10-40 % acetonitrile gradient at 5%/min using a flow rate of 2.5ml/min. Peak detection was done by monitoring both the absorbance at 220nm and tryptophan fluorescence (\u03bb<sub>ex</sub> = 280 nm, \u03bb<sub>era</sub> = 350nm) . Cleavage products were quantitated by integration of chromatograms with respect to appropriate standards . Kinetic parameters were calculated from nonlinear least-squares fit of initial rates as a \n\nfunction of substrate concentration with the help of a Kaleidagraph software, assuming Michaelis-Menten kinetics.</p>\n  K<sub>\u00b1</sub> values of peptide inhibitors were calculated from substrate titration experiments performed in the presence of increasing amounts of inhibitor.

Biochemistry 37, 8899-8905, 1998)</p>\n  In this assay the NS3 protease domain (residues 1027-1206 of the HCV polyprotein) complexed to a modified form of the NS4A peptide, spanning residues 21-34 of the NS4A cofactor in addition to a solubilizing lys-tag, Pep 4AK [KKKGSWIVGRIILSGR(NH<sub>2</sub>) ] were used. As substrate, peptide 4AB [DEMEECASHLPYK] based on the sequence of the NS4A/NS4B cleavage site of the HCV polyprotein, was added . Cleavage assays were performed in 60 \u03bcl 50 mM Hepes pH7.5, 1 % (w/v) CHAPS, 15 % (v/v) glycerol, 10 mM DTT (buffer A) , containing 80 \u03bcM Pep4AK. Buffer solutions \n\nwere preincubated for 10 min with 10-200 nM protease and reactions were started by addition of 10 \u03bcM substrate. Six duplicate data points at different substrate concentrations were used to calculate kinetic parameters. Incubation times were chosen in order to obtain <sub>&lt;</sub>7% substrate conversion and reactions were stopped by addition of 40 \u03bcl 1 % TFA. Reactions were analysed, by HPLC essentially as described above. The fluorescence detector was set to monitor tyrosine fluorescence of substrate and cleavage pro"
