    "nase Phosphorylation of Smad3 </p>[0139] Basic Flash-Plates (NEN Life Sciences) were coated by pipetting 100 micro liter of 0.1 molar sodium bicarbonate (pH 7.6), containing 150 nanograms of the fusion protein glutathion-S -transferase-smad3/100 micro liter of coating buffer. Plates were covered and incubated at room temperature for 10-24 hours. Then the plates were washed 2 times with 200 micro liter of coating buffer (0.1 molar sodium bicarbonate) and allowed to air dry for 2-4 hours. </p>[0140] For the phosphorylation reaction each well received 90 microliter containing 50 millimolar HEPES buffer (pH 7.4); 5 millimolar MgCl<sub>2</sub>; 1 millimolar CaCl<sub>2</sub>; 1 millimolar ditlhiothreitol; 100 micromolar guanosine triphosphate; 0.5 micro Ci/well gamma<sup>33</sup>P-adenosine triphosphate (NEN Life Sciences) and 400 nanograms of a fusion protein of glutathion-S-transferase at the N-termninal end of the kinase domain of ALK5 (GST-ALK5). Background counts were measured by not adding any GST-ALK5. Inhibitors of ALK5 were evaluated by determining the activity of the enzyme in the presence of various compounds. Plates were incubated for 3 hours at 30\u00b0 C. After incubation the assay buffer was removed by aspiration and the wells were washed 3 times with 200 microliter cold 10 millimolar sodium pyrophosphate in phosphate buffered saline. The last wash was aspirated and blotted plate dry. Plate was then counted on a Packard TopCount. </p>[0141] Fluorescence Anisotropy Kinase Binding Assay </p>[0142] The kinase enzyme, fluorescent ligand and a variable concentration of test compound are incubated together to reach thermodynamic equilibrium under conditions such that in the absence of test compound the fluorescent ligand is significantly (&gt;50%) enzyme bound and in the presence of a sufficient concentration (&gt;10\u00d7K<sub>i</sub>) of a potent inhibitor the anisotropy of the unbound fluorescent ligand is measurably different from the bound value. </p>[0143] The concentration of kinase enzyme should preferably be 1\u00d7K<sub>f</sub>. The concentration of fluorescent ligand required will depend on the instrumentation used, and the fluorescent and physicochemical properties. The concentration used must be lower than the concentration of kinase enzyme, and preferably less than half the kinase enzyme concentration. A typical protocol is: </p>[0144] All components dissolved in Buffer of final composition 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM CHAPS, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>2.5% DMSO. </p>[0145] ALK5 Enzyme concentration: 4 nM </p>[0146] Fluorescent ligand concentration: 1 nM </p>[0147] Test compound concentration: 0.1 nM-100 uM </p>[0148] Components incubated in 10 ul final volume in LJL HE 384 type B black microtitre plate until equilibrium reached (5-30 mins) </p>[0149] Fluorescence anisotropy read in LJL Acquest. </p>[0150] Definitions: </p>[0151] K<sub>i</sub>=dissociation constant for inhibitor binding </p>[0152] K<sub>f</sub>=dissociation constant for fluorescent ligand binding </p>[0153] The fluorescent ligand is the following compound:  \n<img id=\"EMI-C00007\" path=\"US20030149277A1-20030807-C00007.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/24100535/US/20030807/A1/020030/14/92/77/US20030149277A1-20030807-C00007.TIF\"/>\n</p>[0154] which is derived from 5-[2-(4-aminomethylphenyl)-5-pyridin-4-yl-1H-imidazol-4-yl]-2-chlorophenol and rhodamine green. </p>[0155] Inhibition of Matrix Markers: Northern Blot Protocol </p>[0156] Data confirming activity in the enzyme assay was obtained as follows. </p>[0157] A498 renal epithelial carcinoma cell lines were obtained from ATCC and grown in EMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (5 units/ml) and streptomycin (5 ng/ml). A498 cells were grown to near confluence in 100 mm dishes, serum-starved for 24 hours, pre-treated with compounds for 4 hours followed by a 10 ng/ml addition of TGF-betal (R&amp;D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis Minn.). Cells were exposed to TGF-betal for 24 hours. Cellular RNA was extracted by acid phenol/chloroform extraction (Chomczynski and Sacchi, 1987). Ten micrograms of total RNA were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to nylon membrane (GeneScreen, NEN Life Sciences, Boston Mass.). Membranes were probed with 32P-labeled cDNA probes (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.) for fibronectin mRNA. Membranes were exposed to phosphorimaging plates and bands were visualized and quantified with ImageQuant "
