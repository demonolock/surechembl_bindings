Members of this riboswitch class are found in the 5\u2032-untranslated region (5\u2032-UTR) of messenger RNAs, where they form highly selective receptors for lysine. Lysine binding to the receptor stabilizes an mRNA tertiary structure that, in most cases, causes transcription termination before the adjacent open reading frame can be expressed. A lysine riboswitch can be used for antibacterial therapy by designing compounds that bind the riboswitch and suppress lysine biosynthesis and transport genes. As a test of this strategy, several lysine analogs that bind to riboswitches and inhibit bacterial growth have been identified. These results indicate that riboswitches can serve as antibacterial drug targets.</p>In one example, a riboswitch-targeting compound is dissimilar to the natural metabolite so that the drug can neither serve as a nutritional supplement for the pathogen, nor interact with host enzymes that process the natural metabolite. In order to identify functional groups where modifications to lysine would be tolerated by lysine riboswitch receptors, 12 lysine analogs were evaluated for their ability to bind the riboswitch receptor from B. subtilis (FIG. 2a). The equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) for each compound was established by conducting in-line probing assays (Soukup 1999) with the 179-nucleotide receptor domain (termed 179 lysC) of the riboswitch (FIG. 2b). In-line probing reveals the ability of each internucleotide linkage to undergo self-cleavage through an S<sub>N</sub>2P mechanism. As previously reported (Sudarsan 2006) there are three regions of the receptor (A, B, and C, FIG. 2b) where the extent of cleavage is reduced, compared to the pattern in the absence of an added compound, indicating that the RNA undergoes a structural change upon ligand binding. Quantitation of the fraction of RNAs cleaved at each region as a function of ligand concentration gives a reasonable measure of K<sub>D </sub>(FIG. 2c).</p>Five of the 12 analogs tested bind to 179 lysC with K<sub>D </sub>values within 40 fold of the K<sub>D </sub>for lysine (360 nM), revealing that the riboswitch can tolerate chemical modifications at certain positions of its ligand. The observation that derivatives 1, 2, 4, and AEC (Sudarsan 2006) bind well indicates that additional modifications of various sizes at the C4 position of lysine are likely to be tolerated by the receptor and may even increase the affinity of the interaction. A large functional group can also be accommodated on N6 (compounds 3 and 7), as long as this amine still carries a hydrogen bond donor and a positive charge at neutral pH. When N6 lacks a hydrogen bond donor (12) or has a pK<sub>a <"
