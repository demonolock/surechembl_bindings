    "isplace 50% of [<sup>3</sup>H]FA bound to FR on KB cells, and the relative affinity of FA for the FR was set to 1. </p>Table 14 details the relative binding affinities of the positive/negative controls and compounds 34 and 37. As shown in Table 14, Compound 34 and Compound 37 were shown to bind folate receptors (FRs) with a higher affinity than folic acid, with relative affinities (RA\u2019s) of 1.53 and 2.21, respectively (see also FIG. 1). </p>Biolog ocal Example 2: Binding affinity assay </p>FR-positive KB cells and FR-negative A549 cells were seeded in 24-well Falcon plates and allowed to form adherent monolayers (&gt;90% confluent) overnight in FFRPMI/HIFCS. Spent incubation medium was replaced with FFRPMI supplemented with 10% HIFCS containing increasing concentrations (0.78 to 100 nmol/L) of [<sup>177</sup>Lu] -Compound 34, [<sup>177</sup>Lu] -Compound 37, or [<sup>177</sup>Lu]-(non-targeted control) in the absence and presence of 10 mM FA. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and then rinsed three times with 0.5 mL PBS. Five hundred microliters of 1% NaOH in PBS were added to each well; after 5 min, cell lysates were collected, transferred to individual tubes, and then counted for radioactivity on a gamma counter. Counts per minute (CPM) values were measured in all samples and plotted against concentration of [<sup>177</sup>Lu] -Compound 34, [<sup>177</sup>Lu]-Compound 37, or [<sup>177</sup>Lu]-(non-targeted control) using GraphPad Prism 8 program. Dissociation constants (Kd) was calculated using a GraphPad \u2019s nonlinear regression one site binding method. \n\n [<sup>177</sup>Lu] -Compound 34 and [<sup>177</sup>Lu]-Compound 37 were shown to bind folate receptors with high affinity with dissociation constants (Kd) values of 7.21 nM and 8.99 nM, respectively (see FIG. 2). Results are further provided in Table 14.

FR-positive M109 or FR-negative HT29 tumor cells were inoculated in the subcutis dorsal medial area of mice. The biodistribution studies were typically performed when tumors were approximately 400-800 mm<sup>3</sup> in volume. Mice were divided into groups of three, and freshly prepared test articles and competitors were injected through the lateral tail vein in a volume of 100 pL/10 g of PBS. Four h to six days post radioactive-agent dose administration, mice were euthanized and organs (blood, heart, lungs, liver, spleen, and kidneys, intestine, stomach, muscle, brain and tumor) were collected, weighed and placed inside counting vials. Each tissue sample was counted for the activities of radioelement using a gamma-counter. Samples of the injectate were used as decay \n\n correction "
