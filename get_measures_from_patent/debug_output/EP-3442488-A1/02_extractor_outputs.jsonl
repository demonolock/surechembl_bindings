{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that meet the specified criteria.

(contains molecule name, metric, and unit, but no specific numeric value for the metric)\n* Given that this antibody is 150-160 KD as tagged, delivery of virtually any derivatized antibody or antibody fragment is feasible as is delivery of similar molecules like botulinum toxins and derivatives or chimeras thereof (contains molecule name and unit, but no bioactivity metric)\n* Formulation 1 + 1% HA (contains molecule name and unit, but no bioactivity metric)\n* Formulation 1 + 0.5% E6 (contains molecule name and unit, but no bioactivity metric)\n\nNote that these sentences do not meet the specified criteria, but they contain some of the required components. If you would like, I can try to extract more information from the text or help with something else."}
