Flow was maintained at the lowest setting and all receptor fluid was collected for each replicate. Flux was continued for 12-20 hours with samples applied and left on donor surfaces. The skin for each cell (each chamber) was washed and the flow through samples were then employed in an assay of alkaline phosphatase content via absorbance. The results are depicted in FIG. 12. </p> [0106] Antibody alone did not exhibit significant penetration as measured by alkaline phosphatase activity in flow through, while decoy-mediated penetration achieved over 2% penetration of the applied load. A statistically significant increase in penetration (P=0.003) was thus achieved simply by the addition of an decoy molecule. This approach thus affords a high percent penetration which enables development of a topical macromolecule therapeutic. Given that this antibody is 150-160 KD as tagged, delivery of virtually any derivatized antibody or antibody fragment is feasible as is delivery of similar molecules like botulinum toxins and derivatives or chimeras thereof </p> EXAMPLE 13 </p> Functional Antioxidant Capacity </p> [0107] Decoys of both hyaluronic acid (HA) and elastin (E6) afford increased penetration of a proprietary mixture of antioxidants from several different formulations. The same antioxidant blend was applied to skin with several different vehicle and decoy \n\n combinations as detailed below. Increased resistance to excess functional oxidative stress resulted. </p> [0108] Diffusion Chambers-Viable porcine skin was dermatomed to mid-dermal thickness, then punch biopsies were performed at n=6 per intended condition. A modified 6- block diffusion cell rig was prepared and set for a flow of 0.022ml/min. The formulations (200\u03bc1 each) were applied to the top (donor) surface and massaged. The receptor fluid was collected for 12 hours for each cell for these experiments, then the skin was removed, cleaned, and snap-frozen for future cold homogenization in saline. </p>Formulations Applied to Porcine </p> Skin </p>Saline </p>Formulation 1 </p>Formulation 1 + 1% HA </p>Formulation 1 + 0.5% E6 </p> (VGVAPG) </p>Formulation 2 formulation Formulation 2 + 1% HA </p>Formulation 2 + 0.5% E6 </p>Formulation 3 </p>Formulation 3 + 1% HA </p>Formulation 3 + 0.5% E6 </p>Formulation 3 + 1% HA + 0.5% E6 </p>[0109] Invitrogen Amplex Red Kit (Cat#A22188): The Ampl"
