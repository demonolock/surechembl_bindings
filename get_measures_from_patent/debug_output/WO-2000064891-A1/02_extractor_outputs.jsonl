{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nThe IC50 of the test compound was defined as the concentration at which 50% of the enzyme activity was inhibited.\n\n\nNote that there is only one sentence that meets the criteria, and it does not contain a specific molecule name or identifier. However, I extracted it as it contains the bioactivity metric IC50, a specific numeric value (50%), and a unit (%). If you would like to extract more context or specific molecule information, please let me know and I can try to help further."}

The text appears to describe experimental methods and refers to tables that are not provided in a readable format. \n\nIf the tables (Table 2a, Table 2b, Table 2c) contained text that met the criteria, it would be possible to extract relevant sentences.
