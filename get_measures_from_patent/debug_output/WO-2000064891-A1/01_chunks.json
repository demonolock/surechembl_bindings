    "ied according to the known method(see, Chung et al., Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 1129, 278, 1992).</p>\n  The enzyme reaction was performed in 50^ of 50mM Sodium HEPES buffer solution containing 25mM of potassium chloride, 25mM of magnesium chloride, lOmM of DTT and 50\u03bc M of zinc chloride. 1.5 \u03bc M of Ras substrate protein, 0.15\u03bc M of tritium-farnesylpyrophosphate and 4.5nM of farnesyl transferase were used. More specifically, in the initial step, farnesyl transferase was added to the above buffer solution, reaction was maintained for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0c and then the reaction was stopped by adding l<sub>m</sub> of ethanol solution containing IM HC1. The fo\u03c0ned precipitates were adsorbed to GF/B filter using Hopper harvestor(Hopper #FH 225V) for filter-binding, washed with ethanol, and then radioactivity of the dried filter was measured using LKB \u03b2 \n\n counter. Enzyme titer was measured in the unsaturated state of substrate where the concentrations of Ras substrate protein and farnesyl transferase have quantitative relationship. The compound according to the present invention dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide(DMSO) was added to the reaction solution in an amount of less than 5% of the total reaction solution, and then the enzyme inhibitory activity thereof was measured. The enzyme inhibitory activity was represented by percentage of the amount of farnesyl incorporated into the Ras substrate protein in the presence of the test compound to that in the absence of the test compound. IC50 of the test compound was defined as the concentration at which 50% of the enzyme activity was inhibited. To evaluate the selective enzyme inhibitory activity of the compound according to the present invention, inhibitory activity on geranylgeranyl transferase was measured. Geranylgeranyl transferase was purified from bovine brain according to the modified Schaber's method(Schaber et al., J. Biol. Chem. 265, 14701, 1990), and substantially the same experimental procedure as that for farnesyl transferase was performed on geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate and Ras-CVIL substiate protein. The test results are represented in the following Table 2.</p>\n  Experimental Example 2</p>\n  Analysis of in vivo inhibitory activity for Ras farnesyl transferase</p>\n  In the present experiment, Rat2 cell line which expresses C-Harvey-Ras protein having transforming activity and Rat2 cell line(Korean patent application No. 97-14409) which is transformed with fused protein of H-Ras substituted with polybasic lysine domain at C-terminus of K-Ras were used. The experiment was performed by the \n\n modified Declue's method(Declue. J. E. et al., Cancer Research, 51, 712, 1991) as follows.</p>\n  3\u03c7 10 cells of transformed Rat2 fibroblast cell line were sprayed on 60mm cell cultivation dish and cultivated for 48 hours in a cell incubator at 37\u00b0c and after 50% or more of density was reached, it was treated with the test compounds. The compound according to the present invention dissolved in dimethylsulfox",
    "n, 2<sub>\u03bc</sub> M of pepstatin A and 2\u03bc M of antipain) and the supernatant wherein the cells were lysed was obtained by high- velocity centrifugation of 12,000g\u03c7 5 minutes. The amount of radioisotope in the supematent was measured and standardized to obtain a quantitative result in immunoprecipitation reaction and then, Y 13-259, a monoclonal antiboby specifically binding to</p>\n  Ras \u03c1rotein(see: Fmth, M. E. et al., J. Virol, 43, 294, 1982) was added and reacted for 15 hours at 4\u00b0c . Protein A(combined with goat anti-murine immunoglobulin antibody )-agarose suspension was added to the solution and reacted for 1 hour at 4\u00b0c and then, to remove the unspecific binding product, immunoprecipitates were washed with a buffer solution (50mM Tris chloride buffer solution containing 50mM of sodium chloride, 0.5%&gt; of sodium dioxycholate, 0.5%) of NP 40 and 0.1% of</p>\n  SDS). The precipitates were added to a buffer solution for \n\nelectrophoresis and boiled and then, electrophoresis was performed using 13.5% of SDS polyacrylamide gel. Atfer electrophoresis, the gel was fixed and dried. Then, the gel was exposed to X-ray film, developed and printed. From the result of the experiment, intensities of band of protein combined with or without farnesyl of Ras protein were measured, and the concentration of the test compound inhibiting 50% of farnesyl binding was defined as CIC50, an in vivo Ras farnesyl transferase inhibitory activity. The test results are shown in the following Table 2. IC50 means the data from Experimental 1 and CIC50 means the data from Experimental 2. \n\n</p>\n  [Table 2a]</p>\n  <img id=\"imgf000144_0001\" path=\"imgf000144_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/169157493/WO/20001102/A1/002000/06/48/91/imgf000144_0001.tif\"/>\n [Table 2b]</p>\n  <img id=\"imgf000145_0001\" path=\"imgf000145_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/169157494/WO/20001102/A1/002000/06/48/91/imgf000145_0001.tif\"/>\n[Table 2c]</p>\n  \n    <img id=\"imgf000146_0001\" path=\"imgf000146_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/169157495/WO/20001102/A1/002000/06/48/91/imgf000146_0001.tif\"/>\n  </p>\n"
