    "acidic solution (pH = 5.5) containing a concentration of GSH (glutathione), the manganese dioxide nanoshells in HMMD are reduced by GSH (glutathione) to water-soluble Mn2+ (MnO) under acidic conditions <sub>2</sub> +2GSH+2H <sup>+</sup> \u2192Mn <sup>2+</sup> +GSSG+2H <sub>2</sub> O). As the manganese dioxide nanoshells are decomposed, the pores of the HMCuSNPs (copper sulfide nanocarriers) are exposed, and DOX (doxorubicin) is then efficiently released from the HMCuSNPs (copper sulfide nanocarriers). About 74.9% of DOX (doxorubicin) was released within 1h, which also indicates that the manganese dioxide nanoshell encapsulated outside the HMCuSNPs (copper sulfide nanocarriers) can act as a \"gate keeper\" to control the release of DOX (doxorubicin).</p>Example three: the prepared nano-reactor HMMD @ PG (nano-reactor of the application) has the anti-tumor capacity; as shown in fig. 5; the mice with HMMD @ PG (nano reactor of the application) +808nm light treatment group have the smallest tumor volume and the best anti-tumor effect</p>Cells were treated with DOX (doxorubicin), HMMD @ pg (nanoreactor of the present application) and HMMD @ pg (nanoreactor of the present application) +808nm laser irradiation, respectively. When the concentration of DOX (adriamycin) added is 4 mug/mL and the concentration of glucose oxidase is 4.32 mug/mL, the activity of the tumor cells in each group is 41.32%, 34.73%, 27.65% and 22.17%, respectively. More importantly, the half inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of free DOX (doxorubicin) treated group was calculated to be 3.8. + -. 0.09. Mu.g/mL, and the IC50 of HMMD @ PG (nanoreactor of the present application) +808nm light treated group was only 0.96. + -. 0.16. Mu.g/mL. When a nano reactor HMMD @ PG (the nano reactor of the application) is given and the laser irradiation coacts, the tumor volume of the mouse is obviously inhibited, which indicates that the tumor treatment effect can be obviously enhanced by the targeted combination of chemotherapy, 808nm laser thermotherapy and improvement of the tumor microenvironment of the HMMD @ PG (the nano reactor of the application) tumor targeted drug delivery system.</p>The platelet membrane is combined with a nano carrier to form a nano reactor by utilizing the targeting effect of the platelet membrane on tumors, can respond to the tumor microenvironment, realizes accurate release of drugs and has high-efficiency anti-tumor capability. The realization is as follows:</p>the glucose oxidase functionalized platelet membrane is combined with the nano platform HMMD to realize the successful preparation of the stimulation sensitive nano carrier;</p>nanoreactors respond effectively to GSH (glutathione) (MnO) <sub>2</sub> +GSH\u2192Mn <sup>2+</sup> + GSSG), low pH (5.5), and consumes glucose, H produced during glucose consumption <sub>2</sub> O <sub>2</sub>Reacting with the nano-reactor to generate oxygen provides the raw material</p>After GSH (glutathione) is consumed by HMMD @ PG (nano reactor of the application), the consumption of manganese dioxide nano shell and the dual action of low pH"
