    "hich typically are of different species. In some examples, a chimeric antibody includes one or more CDRs and/or framework regions from one human antibody and CDRs and/or framework regions from another human antibody.</p>A \u201cfully human antibody\u201d or \u201chuman antibody\u201d is an antibody which includes sequences from (or derived from) the human genome, and does not include sequence from another species. In some embodiments, a human antibody includes CDRs, framework regions, and (if present) an Fc region from (or derived from) the human genome. Human antibodies can be identified and isolated using technologies for creating antibodies based on sequences derived from the human genome, for example by phage display or using transgenic animals (see, e.g., Barbas et al. Phage display: A Laboratory Manuel. 1st Ed. New York: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2004. Print.; Lonberg, Nat. Biotech., 23: 1117-1125, 2005; Lonenberg, Curr. Opin. Immunol., 20:450-459, 2008).</p>An antibody may have one or more binding sites. If there is more than one binding site, the binding sites may be identical to one another or may be different. For instance, a naturally-occurring immunoglobulin has two identical binding sites, a single-chain antibody or Fab fragment has one binding site, while a bispecific or bifunctional antibody has two different binding sites.</p>Methods of testing antibodies for the ability to bind to any functional portion of the CAR are known in the art and include any antibody-antigen binding assay, such as, for example, radioimmunoassay (RIA), ELISA, Western blot, immunoprecipitation, and competitive inhibition assays (see, e.g., Janeway et al., infra, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002/0197266 A1, and U.S. Pat. No. 7,338,929).</p>Also, a CAR, a T cell expressing a CAR, an antibody, or antigen binding portion thereof, can be to comprise a detectable label, such as, for instance, a radioisotope, a fluorophore (e.g., fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), phycoerythrin (PE)), an enzyme (e.g., alkaline phosphatase, horseradish peroxidase), and element particles (e.g., gold particles).</p>C. Conjugates</p>A CAR, a T cell expressing a CAR, or monoclonal antibodies, or antigen binding fragments thereof, specific for one or more of the antigens disclosed herein, can be conjugated to an agent, such as an effector molecule or detectable marker, using any number of means known to those of skill in the art. Both covalent and noncovalent attachment means may be used. Conjugates include, but are not limited to, molecules in which there is a covalent linkage of an effector molecule or a detectable marker to an antibody or antigen binding fragment that specifically binds one or more of the antigens disclosed herein. One of skill in the art will appreciate that various effector molecules and detectable markers can be used, including (but not limited to) chemotherapeutic agents, anti-angiogenic agents, toxins, radioactive agents such as <sup>125</sup>I, <sup>32</sup",
    "tulinum toxins A through F. These toxins are well known in the art and many are readily available from commercial sources (for example, Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo.). Contemplated toxins also include variants of the toxins (see, for example, see, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,079,163 and 4,689,401).</p>Saporin is a toxin derived from Saponaria officinalis that disrupts protein synthesis by inactivating the 60S portion of the ribosomal complex (Stirpe et al., Bio/Technology, 10:405-412, 1992). However, the toxin has no mechanism for specific entry into cells, and therefore requires conjugation to an antibody or antigen binding fragment that recognizes a cell-surface protein that is internalized in order to be efficiently taken up by cells.</p>Diphtheria toxin is isolated from Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Typically, diphtheria toxin for use in immunotoxins is mutated to reduce or to eliminate non-specific toxicity. A mutant known as CRM107, which has full enzymatic activity but markedly reduced non-specific toxicity, has been known since the 1970's (Laird and Groman, J. Virol. 19:220, 1976), and has been used in human clinical trials. See, U.S. Pat. No. 5,792,458 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,021.</p>Ricin is the lectin RCA60 from Ricinus communis (Castor bean). For examples of ricin, see, U.S. Pat. No. 5,079,163 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,689,401. Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA) occurs in two forms designated RCA60 and RCA120 according to their molecular weights of approximately 65 and 120 kD, respectively (Nicholson &amp; Blaustein, J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta 266:543, 1972). The A chain is responsible for inactivating protein synthesis and killing cells. The B chain binds ricin to cell-surface galactose residues and facilitates transport of the A chain into the cytosol (Olsnes et al., Nature 249:627-631, 1974 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,060,165).</p>Ribonucleases have also been conjugated to targeting molecules for use as immunotoxins (see Suzuki et al., Nat. Biotech. 17:265-70, 1999). Exemplary ribotoxins such as a-sarcin and restrictocin are discussed in, for example Rathore et al., Gene 190:31-5, 1997; and Goyal and Batra, Biochem. 345 Pt 2:247-54, 2000. Calicheamicins were first isolated from Micromonospora echinospora and are members of the enediyne antitumor antibiotic family that cause double strand breaks in DNA that lead to apoptosis (see, for example Lee et al., J. Antibiot. 42:1070-87,1989). The drug is the toxic moiety of an immunotoxin in clinical trials (see, for example, Gillespie et al., Ann. Oncol. 11:735-41, 2000).</p>Abrin includes toxic lectins from Abrus precatorius. The toxic principles, abrin a, b, c, and d, have a molecular weight of from about 63 and 67 kD and are composed of two disulfide-linked polypeptide chains A and B. The A chain inhibits protein synthesis; the B chain (abrin-b) binds to D-galactose residues (see, Funatsu et al., Agr. Biol. Chem. 52:1095, 1988; and Olsnes, Methods Enzymol. 50:330-335, 1978).</p>A CAR, a T cell expressing a CAR, monoclonal antibodies, antigen binding fragments thereof, specific for one or more of the antigens disclosed herein, can also be conjugated with a detectable marker; for example, a detectable marker capable of detection by ELISA, spectrophotometry, flow cytometry, microscopy or diagnostic imaging techniques (such as computed tomography (CT), computed axial tomography (CAT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), nuclear magnetic resonance imaging NMRI), magnetic resonance tomography (MTR), ultrasound, fiberoptic examination, and laparoscopic examination). Specific, non-limiting examples of detectable markers include fluorophores, chemiluminescent agents, enzymatic linkages, radioactive isotopes and heavy metals or compounds (for example super paramagnetic iron oxide nanocrystals for detection by MRI). For example, useful detectable markers include fluorescent compounds, including fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, 5-dimethylamine-1-napthalenesulfonyl chloride, phycoerythrin, lanthanide phosphors and the like. Bioluminescent markers are also of use, such as luciferase, Green fluorescent protein (GFP), Yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). A CAR, a T cell expressing ",
    "dish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-M13 antibody. After incubation with the antibody, the nonspecifically bound antibody was removed by washing wells, and the 3,3,\u20325,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate was added, and solution absorbance at 450 nm (A450) measured. Clones that bound to mesothelin with A450 of &gt;1.0 were selected for further characterization.</p>b) Expression and purification of selected soluble scFvs.</p>The VH and VL of the selected clones were DNA sequenced, and the scFvs encoded by clones with unique sequences were expressed and purified as described below. Plasmids extracted from these clones were used for transformation of HB2151 cells. A single colony was picked from the plate containing freshly transformed cells, inoculated into 200 ml 2YT medium containing 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin and 0.2% glucose, and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. with shaking at 250 rpm. When the culture OD at 600 nm reached 0.90, isopropyl-\u03b2-d-thiogalactopyranoside at a 0.5 mM final concentration was added, and the culture was further incubated overnight at 30\u00b0 C. The bacterial pellet was collected after centrifugation at 8,000\u00d7g for 20 min and resuspended in PBS buffer containing 0.5 mU polymixin B (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.). After 30 min incubation with rotation at 50 rpm at room temperature, the resuspended pellet was centrifuged at 25,000\u00d7g for 25 min at 4\u00b0 C., and the supernatant was used for scFv purification using the Ni-NTA resin following vendor protocol (Qiagen).</p>c) ELISA Binding Assay</p>50 \u03bcl of the diluted recombinant human mesothelin in PBS at 2 ug/ml was coated in a 96-well plate at 4\u00b0 C. overnight. Purified scFv (from above) with His and Flag tags was serially diluted and added into the target protein coated wells. After washing, a 1:3000 diluted HRP conjugated anti-Flag antibody was added for 1 hr at RT. After washing, 3, 3, 5, 5\u2032-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate was added, 1N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>was added to stop the reaction after incubation at room temperature for 10 minutes, and the O.D. was read at 450 nm to quantify the relative ability of scFv to bind mesothelin.</p>RESULTS:</p>Based upon the results of the ELISA binding assay, four separate scFs clones specific for recombinant human mesothelin were identified and labeled as human anti-mesothelin ScFv binders MH1P, MH2P, MH6P and M1-4S, respectively. The generation of chimeric antigen receptors expressing the MH1P, MH2P, MH6P and M1-4S human anti-mesothelin ScFv binders is outlined in Example 2, infra.</p>Example 2CARs Expressing Anti-Mesothelin Fully Human ScFv Binding Sequences</p>In this Example, anti-mesothelin CAR T cells derived from four novel fully human ScFv binder sequences are described. The novel anti-mesothelin CART constructs have demonstrated high level expression in primary human T cells and specific and potent cytolytic activity against mesothelin-positive tumor cells.</p>Materials and Methods:</p>(a) Cell Lines</p>A431 human squamous carcinoma cell line was purchased from American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, Va.). The parent A431 line and its subclones were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (ATCC) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum.</p>Luciferase-expressing A431 subclone was generated by stably transducing wild-type A431 cells with lentiviral vector encoding firefly luciferase (Lentigen Technology, Inc., Gaithersburg, Md.), followed by limiting dilution and selection of luciferase-positive clones. Similarly, A431-MSLN subclone was derived by transduction of A431 luciferase positive clone with a lentiviral vector encoding human mesothelin gene isoform 1 (RefSeq ID NM_"
