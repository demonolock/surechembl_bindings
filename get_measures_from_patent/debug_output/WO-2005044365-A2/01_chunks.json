    "and 340 and susceptor 342 or coating 344. Examples of functional groups used in linking reactions include amines, sulfhydryls, carbohydrates, carboxyls, hydroxyls, and the like. The \n\nlinking agent may be a homobifunctional or heterobifunctional crosslinking reagent, for example, carbodiimides, sulfo-NHS esters linkers, and the like. The linking agent may also be an aldehyde crosslinking reagent, such as glutaraldehyde. The linking agent may be chosen to link ligand 340 to susceptor 342 or coating 344 in a preferable orientation, specifically with the active region of the ligand 340 available for targeting. Physical interaction does not require that the linking molecule and ligand 340 be bound directly to susceptor 342 or to coating 344 by non-covalent means such as, for example, absorption, adsorption, or intercalation. Figure 4 schematically illustrates an example of a ligand that may be used with an embodiment of the present invention. The ligand may be an antibody having a fragment crystallization (Fc) region 460 and fragment antigen binding (Fab) regions 472. Fab regions 472 may be the antigen binding regions of the antibody that include a variable light region 464 and a constant light region 466, along with a variable heavy region 468 and a constant heavy region 470. Biological activity of antibodies may be determined to a large extent by the Fc region 460 of the antibody molecule. Fc region 460 may include complement activation constant heavy chains 482 and macrophage binding constant heavy chains 484. Fc region 460 and Fab regions 472 may be connected by several disulfide linkages 462. Ligands that do not include the Fc region 460 may be preferable in order to avoid immunogenic response. Examples of these ligands may include antibody fragments, fragment antigen binding fragments (Fabs) 472, disulf\u03cade-stabilized variable region fragments (dsFVs) 474, single chain variable region fragments (scFVs) 480, recombinant single chain antibody fragments, and peptides. An antigen binding fragment (Fab) 472 may include a single Fab region 472 of an antibody. Single Fab region 472 may include a variable light 464 and a constant light region 466 bound to a variable heavy 468 and a constant heavy region 470 by a disulfide bond 462. A disulfide-stabilized variable region fragment (dsFV) 474 may include a variable heavy region 468 and a variable light region 464 of antibody joined by a disulfide bond. A leader sequence 476, which may be a peptide, may be linked to a variable light region 464 and variable heavy regions 468. Single chain variable region fragment (scFV) 480 may include a variable heavy region 468 and variable light region 464 of antibody joined by a linker peptide 478. A leader sequence 476 may be linked to the variable heavy region 468. \n\n Examples of ligand embodiments of the present invention may include, for example, polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, human antibodies, recombinant ant"
