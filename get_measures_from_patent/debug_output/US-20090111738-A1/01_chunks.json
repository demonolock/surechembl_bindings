    "ticular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of individuals.</p>Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of active compounds and pharmaceutical compositions can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals. For example, such procedures are routinely applied for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compounds that exhibit large therapeutic indices are generally preferred.</p>The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies (including those described in the examples, below) can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans or other intended subject. The dosage of such compounds is usually selected to produce a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. Thus, for example, a dose may be initially established in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the EC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal response) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography, or by other suitable analysis method adapted for the compound of interest.</p>As noted, peptides (e.g., synthetic or recombinantly produced peptides) with growth factor-binding activity can be incorporated into a tissue engineered product. FN domains that promote fibroblast migration can also be included. Preferably, the products are robust (i.e., relatively resistant to rapid degradation). They can be used, for example, in treating wounds, including acute or non-healing wounds (e.g., chronic ulcers). Patients amenable to treatment are described further below. Alternatively or in addition, growth factor-binding peptides can be tethered to a biocompatible polymer for delivery of one or more growth factors to a cell, tissue or organ in need of treatment.</p>We have developed an engineered ECM that is conductive and inductive of new tissue formation in porcine cutaneous wounds utilizing molecular domains C, H, and HV of the blood protein fibronectin (FN) tethered to an intramolecularly crosslinked hyaluronin (HA) hydrogel. Thus, in one implementation, the invention includes an engineered ECM that includes a fragment of a fibronectin (e.g., a plasma fibronectin) or a biologically active vari",
    "rried out with various compositions, including fragments of fibronectin per se as well as complexes containing such fragments bound to growth factors and the tissue-engineered solid-support products described herein. Similarly, one can promote the delivery of stem cells by administering to a patient a therapeutically effective amount of a composition that includes stem cells and a fragment of fibronectin as described herein (in its various forms, including forms in which the fragment of fibronectin is associated with a solid support or contained within a tissue engineered product). More generally, the methods of the invention include methods for promoting the isolation, proliferation, and delivery of cells. As noted, these cells can be stem cells or can be differentiating into, or differentiated into, epithelial cells, fibroblasts, myocytes, neural cells, endothelial cells, chondrocytes, hematopoietic cells or lymphocytes. The cells can be genetically engineered or simply isolated from a patient or a cell or tissue culture.</p>EXAMPLESFibronectin growth factor-binding domains are promiscuous and can tether active GF to the ECM or maintain or enhance GF activity in solution Data from our laboratory has demonstrated the binding of TGF-\u03b21, PDGF-BB, VEGF-A, and FGF-2 with fibronectin (FN) and its functional domains as well as biological implications of these interactions. Briefly, radiolabeled GFs bound intact FN with the following KDs as judged by non linear regression: TGF-\u03b21, KD=5.3\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M; PDGF-BB, KD=4.9\u00d710<sup>\u2212</sup>M, FGF-2, KD=4.4\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M. As determined by plasmon resonance modulation, all GFs, except EGF, bound to the composite heparinII-binding and variably-spliced IIICS domains (FNIII<sub>12-V15</sub>) with the following order of affinities: VEGF (KD=6.0\u00d710<sup>\u221210 </sup>M)&gt;TGF-\u03b21 (KD=2.5\u00d710<sup>\u22129 </sup>M)&gt;PDGF-BB (KD=1.7\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M)&gt;FGF-2 (KD=3.7\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M). Similar rank orders of affinities were observed with GF binding to the heparinII-binding domain (FNIII<sub>12-15 </sub>and FNIII<sub>12-14</sub>): PDGF-BB (KD=6.8\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M)\u2267TGF-\u03b21 (KD=1.6\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M)&gt;FGF-2 (KD=1.7\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M); TGF-\u03b21 (KD=7.6\u00d710<sup>\u22129 </sup>M)&gt;PDGF-BB (KD=5.5\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M), respectively. VEGF, TGF-\u03b21, PDGF-BB and FGF-2 bound IIICS with similar affinities (KD=10<sup>\u22127 </sup>M). EGF again failed to bind this functional domain and all others tested. None of the GFs detectably bound the amino-terminal end of FN (FN<sub>70</sub>) nor the classic cell-binding domain containing RGD (FNIII<sub>8-11</sub>). Although TGF-\u03b21 and PDGF-BB bound the FNIII<sub>1-11</sub>, VEGF and FGF-2 did not. Nevertheless, all four GFs bound FNIII<sub>17</sub>, FNIII<sub>1-2</sub>, FNIII<sub>1 </sub>and FNIII<sub>2</sub>, and all but VEGF bound anastellin, a 76-aa peptide within FNIII<sub>1</sub>. These data strongly suggest a cryptic GF-binding site within the first and second type III repeat of FN. The tested biological activities of GFs bound to a FN functional domain were retained or enhanced. Our studied suggest that FN, or its fragments, may act as promiscuous cofactors for GFs and provide a novel mechanism by which GFs and ECM may accentuate the cooperativity of GF receptors and integrins on the cell surface. In addition, our studies provide important information regarding the delivery of GFs and the sequestering of GFs, as appropriate, for therapeutic (e.g., surgical) or aesthetic indications, including wound healing treatments (where an aim is GF delivery) and cancer treatments (where an aim is GF sequestration). Where FN fragments are used to deliver GFs, they may be described as maintaining, activating, stabilizing or enhancing GF activity.</p>Synthetic Peptides that Bind TGF-\u03b21 and PDGF-BB</p>We have elucidated four homologous 25 amino acid sequences within FN. Two are within FNIII<sub>1 </sub>(peptide 1 and peptide 2), one within FNIII<sub>13 </sub>(peptide 3), and one within the FN variably-spliced IIICS (peptide 4). Their sequences are:</p>QPSHISKYILRWRPKNSVGRWKEAT;(peptide 1;SEQ ID NO: _) QLIS.IQQYGHQEVTRFDFTTTSTST;(peptide 2;SEQ ID NO: _) NGQTPIQRTIKPDVRSYTITGLQPGT;(peptide 3;SEQ ID NO: _)and QPSVGQQMIFEEHGFRRTTPPTTAT.(peptide 4;SEQ ID NO: _)</p>These peptides represent domains that follow the sequence pattern [QN]-X(1,2)-[ST]-X(0,1)-[IG]-[QS]-[KRQ]-[YTM]-[IG]-X(4,5)-X(0,1)-[KR]-X(1,2)-X(1,2)-[RT]-X(1,2)-[KQTS]-X(2)-T and that bind TGF-\u03b21 with a certain affinity. Our equilibrium binding experiments indicate binding affinities of 1.3\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, 2.7\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, 1.4\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M and 1\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, respectively. We know of no other peptides in the human genome database that follow this pattern. Peptide 1 also binds PDGF-BB (KD=2.5\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M) while a scrambled control does not. Further analysis of peptide 1 demonstrated that QPSHISKYILRWRPK (peptide 1A; SEQ ID NO:______) and ILRWRPKNSVGRWK (peptide 1B; SEQ ID NO:______) bound TGF-\u03b21 with affinities of 4.4\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M and 4.0\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, respectively, while QPSHISKY (SEQ ID NO:______) had minimal binding activity.</p>Among our objectives was the production of an acellular 3-dimensional (3-D) extracellular matrix that facilitates tissue repair through its intrinsic ability to recruit cells, such as parenchymal cells, to the site of an injury and to induce them to produce new cells and tissue(s). As noted above, the ECM can include one to three (or all three) fibronectin functional domains (FNfds), including FNIII<sub>8-11 </sub>(C), FNIII<sub>12-15 </sub>(H) and FNIII<sub>12-v15 </sub>(HV), which can be constructed recombinantly as arrayed on a natural FN heterodimer and incorporated into a hydrogel (e.g., tethered to an intramolecularly crosslinked hyaluronan (HA) hydrogel). C, H and HV appear to be necessary and sufficient for optimal adult human fibroblast migration. FNIII<sub>1</sub>, as well as H and HV, promiscuously, but selectively, bind growth factors, which retain functional activity while bound. This finding led us to believe that engineered ECM can bind GFs, whether exogenously added or endogenously generated, and thereby localize them in an active form to sites where an engineered ECM has been applied. Appropriate ",
    "med by measuring the percent area of wound granulation tissue that was occupied by the new capillaries. All wound additives accentuated angiogenesis above the \u201cno treatment\u201d control, with the xHA-FNfd\u00b1PDGF-BB hydrogels showing a 2-fold increase. Unlike the effects seen in granulation tissue accumulation and re-epithelialization, PDGF-BB failed to significantly enhance angiogenesis observed with xHA-FNfd alone. Both xHA-FNfd\u00b1PDGF hydrogels showed marked increase in percent neovascularization over xHA-RGD+PDGF hydrogels.</p>FN Domains Bind PDGF-BB</p>PDGF is a potent chemoattractant and mitogen for fibroblasts, promotes healing of soft tissue wounds and is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of chronic cutaneous ulcers. Interestingly, we observed that as little as 100 ng/ml (15 ng total per wound) PDGF-BB added to 2:1 engineered ECM enhanced granulation formation at 4 days after injury and application of material.</p>This led us to speculate that PDGF was binding to the engineered ECM through the H or HV domain since vascular endothelial GF (VEGF), a member of the PDGF superfamily, had been reported to bind H and remain active while bound. Equilibrium binding studies and surface plasmon resonance were utilized to assay amino- to carboxy-terminal FN domains (FN70, FNIII<sub>17</sub>, FNIII<sub>8-11 </sub>(C), and FNIII<sub>12-V15 </sub>(HV) for PDGF binding activity. FNIII<sub>1-7 </sub>and HV were found to have strong binding affinities for PDGF-BB (KD=7.5\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, KD=2.1\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, respectively) while the 70 kDa amino terminus of FN (FN70), which includes fibrin and gelatin binding domains and C (FNIII<sub>8-11</sub>) did not. Plasmon surface resonance kinetic binding confirmed these results (KD=1.0\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, KD=1.7\u00d710<sup>\u22128</sup>M, respectively). Compared to PDGF-BB binding to FNIII<sub>12-V15 </sub>(KD=2.1\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M), similar equilibrium binding was observed to FNIII<sub>12-15 </sub>(KD=6.8\u00d710<sup>\u22129 </sup>M), FNIII<sub>12-14 </sub>(KD=3.5\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M) and FNIII<sub>12-13 </sub>(K=7.5\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M) and somewhat weaker binding to IIICS (KD=3.5\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M). Interestingly, GFs binding to FNIII<sub>12-V15 </sub>(HV) failed to demonstrate any diminution when up to 2.5 M NaCl was added or when pH was lowered to about 2.0 strongly indicating that charge is not required for the interaction.</p>As judged by equilibrium binding, FNIII<sub>1 </sub>and FNIII<sub>1-2 </sub>bound PDGF-BB (KD=3.2\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, 3.7\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, respectively), while FNIII<sub>3-6 </sub>did not. Plasma surface resonance confirmed these findings: FNIII<sub>1 </sub>(KD=3.7\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M), FNIII<sub>1-2 </sub>(KD=9.1\u00d710<sup>\u22129 </sup>M), and no binding with FNIII<sub>3-6</sub>.</p>Four Homologous Peptides within 3 FN Domains Bind PDGF-BB</p>To further localize PDGF-BB binding within FNIII<sub>1</sub>, we acquired a peptide from the central 76 amino acids (aa) of FNIII<sub>1 </sub>(FN630-704), which has anti-angiogenic properties and promotes FN polymerization. This peptide as well as its two halves, FN630-667 and FN668-704, demonstrated PDGF-BB binding. Next, we looked for sequence homologies within the two halves of the peptide and discovered the sequence pattern noted above ([QN]-X(1,2)-[ST]-X(0,1)-[IG]-[QS]-[KRQ]-[YTM]-[IG]-X(4,5)-X(0,1)-[KR]-X(1,2)-X(1,2)-[RT]-X(1,2)-[KQTS]-X(2)-T) (see peptides 1-4). The four homologous peptides demonstrated binding with PDGF-BB while scrambled variants did not. These findings may explain similar PDGF-BB binding among FN heparin-binding domains, FNIII<sub>12-V15</sub>, FNIII<sub>12-15</sub>, FNIII<sub>12-14</sub>, FNIII<sub>12-13</sub>, and IIICS. Smaller peptides from FNIII<sub>1 </sub>revealed PDGF-BB binding with FN630-648:WNAPQPSHISKYILRWRPK (SEQ ID NO:______); KD=3.4\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M) and a 15 aa peptide FN634-648: QPSHISKYILRWRPK (SEQ ID NO:______); KD=4.5\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M), but not with the 8 aa peptide FN634-641: QPSHISKY (SEQ ID NO:______), nor FN641-654:YILRWRPKNSVGRW (SEQ ID NO:______), nor FN648-667:KNSVGRWKEATIPGHLNSYT (SEQ ID NO______).</p>Next, we determined if PDGF-BB-binding peptides from FNIII<sub>1 </sub>could inhibit PDGF-BB binding to FNIII<sub>1</sub>, FNIII<sub>12-14 </sub>and IIICS. For initial experiments we selected peptide 1 and peptide 2. For control, we used scrambled peptide 1. Although peptide 1 showed marked inhibition of PDGF-BB binding to all three FN domains, neither peptide 2, nor the scramble varient of peptide 1 (FN634-658s), demonstrated inhibition of PDGF-BB binding to any of the FN domains. We noted that peptide 1 bound PDGF-BB with slightly less affinity than peptide 2 (KD=2.5\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, KD=1.1\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, respectively).</p>PDGF-BB Bound to FNIII<sub>1-2</sub>, FNIII<sub>12-15 </sub>(HV) or FNIII<sub>12-15 </sub>(HV) retains Biological Activity</p>To determine whether PDGF-BB, bound to recombinant FN domains, remained active, we investigated the migratory response of AHDF to 100 ng/ml PDGF-BB preloaded for two hours in engineered ECM containing C, H, and HV (268 nM bulk density, each) versus PDGF-BB preloaded on engineered ECM containing only C. Preloading was followed by 10 washes with DMEM. For each wash the engineered ECM was gently agitated on an orbital shaker for 5 minutes. The last wash had little or no detectable PDGF motogenic activity. As a positive control, PDGF-BB was added to the medium of both engineered ECM constructs. Fibroblasts migrated as well to PDGF-BB preloaded on engineered ECM tethered with C, H and HV as to PDGF-BB added to the culture medium. In contrast, no fibroblast migration occurred when PDGF was preloaded on engineered ECM containing C alone although cell migration on engineered ECM tethered with C responded well when PDGF was added to the medium. In other experiments, PDGF was preloaded on engineered ECM containing C alone or C plus FNIII<sub>1-2</sub>. Fibroblasts migrated as well to PDGF-BB preloaded on engineered ECM tethered with C plus FNIII<sub>1-2 </sub>as to PDGF-BB added to the culture medium. Similar data was acquired when human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC) were used in these migration assays",
    "ived on FNIII<sub>1-11 </sub>even in the absence of PDGF-BB suggesting perhaps that the cells load endogenous PDGF on FN PDGF-binding domains. Importantly, differential response of FN-null cells, plated on different FN domains, to PDGF-BB was not secondary to differences in attachment as judged by cell counts two hours after plating. The FNIII<sub>8-11 </sub>central cell binding domain was present in all circumstances. When PDGF-BB was added to FN-null cells 2 hrs after plating, they showed enhance survival on FNIII<sub>8-11</sub>+FNIII<sub>1-12</sub>, FNIII<sub>12-14</sub>, FNIII<sub>12-V15 </sub>or IIICS, but not FNIII<sub>8-11 </sub>alone or FNIII<sub>8-11</sub>+FNIII<sub>3-6</sub>, and robust proliferation on intact FN, FNIII<sub>1-11 </sub>or FNIII<sub>8-V15</sub>.</p>Intact FN Provides Promiscuous, But Selective, GF-Binding Sites</p>The survival of FN-null fibroblasts in the presence to PDGF-BB required substrate coated with intact FN or FNIII<sub>8-11</sub>+a PDGF-binding FN domain. FNIII<sub>8-11 </sub>alone and FNIII<sub>8-11</sub>+FNIII<sub>3-6 </sub>did not support cell survival. These data strongly suggest that PDGF-BB binds intact FN. That is, PDGF-BB binding sites on FN are not cryptic as demonstrated for FN self-association sites. To address this directly, we performed equilibrium binding assays with PDGF-BB to FN adsorbed to a surface or coupled to agarose beads. In addition, we also investigated the ability of other growth factors to bind intact FN. PDGF-BB (KD=4.9\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M), TGF-\u03b21 (KD=5.3\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M) and bFGF (KD=4.4\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M) bound intact FN while EGF, TGF-\u03b1 and FGF-1 did not.</p>TGF-\u03b21 and bFGF Binds the Same FN Domains and Peptides as PDGF-BB</p>To determine whether FN domains bind TGF-\u03b21 and bFGF, equilibrium and kinetic binding was performed. TGF-\u03b21 bound FNIII1-7 (KD=1.7\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M) and FNIII12-V15 (KD=9.7\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M), but not FN70 nor FNIII 8-11, as previously observed with PDGF-BB. Kinetic binding via plasmon surface resonance confirmed these findings (KD=1.8\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, KD=2.5\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, respectively). Similar data was acquired with bFGF, which bound to FNIII<sub>1-7 </sub>(KD=4.1\u00d710<sup>\u22129 </sup>M) and FNIII<sub>12-V15 </sub>(KD=3.7\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M), but not FN70 nor FNIII<sub>8-11</sub>. EGF, TGF-\u03b1 and FGF-1 failed to bind to any these FN domains.</p>Furthermore, FNIII<sub>1</sub>, FNIII<sub>12-14</sub>, FNIII<sub>12-15 </sub>and IIICS, but not FNIII<sub>3-6</sub>, also bound TGF-\u03b21 (KD=6.2\u00d710<sup>\u22129 </sup>M, 7.6\u00d710<sup>\u22129 </sup>M, 1.6\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, 7.4\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, respectively) and bFGF (KD=3.5\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, 1.9\u00d710<sup>\u22129 </sup>M, 1.3\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, 5.8\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, respectively). Peptides 1-4 could bind TGF-\u03b21 and bFGF and peptide 1 completely inhibited TGF-\u03b21 and bFGF binding to any recombinant FN domain as shown for PDGF-BB. Once again, EGF, TGF-\u03b1 and FGF-1 failed to bind to any recombinant FN domain or synthetic peptide. In no case did any GF bind the 70 kDa amino terminus of FN domain (FN70), which includes the fibrin I and gelatin binding domains, nor FNIII<sub>3-6</sub>, nor FNIII<sub>8-11 </sub>(the central cell binding domain, C).</p>TGF-\u03b21 or bFGF Bound to FNIII1-2 and FNIII12-V15 Retains Biological Activity</p>Although TGF-\u03b21 has been reported to bind directly to decorin, a proteoglycan found in connective tissue including the dermis, and to FN through latent TGF-\u03b2 binding protein LTBP-2, the TGF-\u03b21 is inactive while bound to these ECM molecules. TGF-\u03b2 that adhered to FN retained full functional activity as judged by inhibition of [<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine incorporation by CCL-64 mink lung cells, as described in the literature. Therefore, we investigated whether it retained its activity while bound to recombinant FN functional domains. FNIII<sub>8-11 </sub>was adsorbed on plastic tissue culture dishes at a surface density to maximally affect the attachment and spreading of human dermal fibroblasts with or without the presence of adsorbed FNIII<sub>1-2</sub>.
