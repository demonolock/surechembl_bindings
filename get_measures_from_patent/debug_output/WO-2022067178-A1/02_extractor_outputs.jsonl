After two rounds of affinity maturation, the new nanobody variant, named TI23, exhibits an EC50 of 8.6 nM in 3T3 cells, close to that of the native Hedgehog ligand.\n(G) In the human mesenchymal cell line HEPM, TI23 activated Hedgehog response and induced transcription of pathway targets, GLI1 (EC<sub>50</sub> = 16.0 nM) and PTCH1 (EC<sub>50</sub> = 18.5 nM), as assayed by qPCR.\n(H) In NIH-3T3 cells, ShhNp and TI23 are titrated in a Gli-luciferase assay. EC50 for ShhNp and TI23 are determined to be 1.4 nM and 6.9 nM, respectively."}
