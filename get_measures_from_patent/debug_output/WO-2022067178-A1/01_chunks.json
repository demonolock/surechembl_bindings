(A) Alignment of transmembrane 4 (from top to bottom SEQ ID NOs:31-34) and 10 (from top to bottom SEQ ID \n\n NOs:35-38) from different RND transporters. The charged residues are marked by asterisks. (B) Flow chart of the steps for nanobody selection. The yeast library was first enriched with MACS for clones that bind to PTCH1-NNQ variant and then the population that prefers the NNQ variant was selected in FACS using PTCH1-NNQ and PTCH1-WT with different fluorescent labels. (C) Yeast cells stained with PTCH1-NNQ (FITC label) and PTCH1-WT (Alexa 647 label) are shown in the FACS plot. In the lower right quadrant are the cells that prefer NNQ variant to the WT variant. Due to more non-specific binding to Alexa 647 fluorophore than the FITC fluorophore, the double positive population shifts towards the upper left quadrant. (D) Nanobodies expressed and purified in E. coli were tested on Hedgehog-responsive 3T3 cells with a Gli-dependent luciferase reporter. GDC-0449, a pathway antagonist, is a control showing that nanobodies 17, 20 and 23 display weak activation in this assay. (E) Initial nanobody sequences of clones 17, 20 and 23 were mutagenized and selected in yeast display to obtain higher affinity clones (affinity maturation). After two rounds of affinity maturation, the new nanobody variant, named TI23, exhibits an EC50 of 8.6 nM in 3T3 cells, close to that of the native Hedgehog ligand. (F) The TI23 clone resulting from two rounds of affinity maturation showed a preference for binding to PTCH1-NNQ variant. Yeast cells expressing Nb23, T23 or TI23 were incubated with a mixture of 1:1 Protein C tagged PTCH1-WT and 1D4 tagged PTCH1-NNQ proteins, and then stained with antibodies against protein C tag or 1D4 tag. OneComp beads were used as a control for non-selective binding, as these beads bind to the constant region of kappa chain, and do not discriminate between different antibodies used for staining. (G) In the human mesenchymal cell line HEPM, TI23 activated Hedgehog response and induced transcription of pathway targets, GLI1 (EC<sub>50</sub> = 16.0 nM) and PTCH1 (EC<sub>50</sub> = 18.5 nM), as assayed by qPCR. (H) In NIH-3T3 cells, ShhNp and TI23 are titrated in a Gli-luciferase assay. EC50 for ShhNp and TI23 are determined to be 1.4 nM and 6.9 nM, respectively. Error bars represent standard deviation and all data points represent the mean of a triplicate. [0018] Figure 2. Overview of mouse PTCH1::TI23 complex structure. (A) The cryo-EM map of PTCH1::TI23 complex shows clear features of the proteins. PTCH1, violet; TI23, yellow. (B) Protein model of the complex with PTCH1 and TI23 colored as in A. Lipid-like densities found in the map were modeled in sites I through IV. (C) Schematic view of PTCH1 showing the secondary structure elements and the relative positions of TI23 and the lipid-like densities. The key helix involved in the conformational change is highlighted as \u2018switch helix\u201d. (D) The binding site of TI23 on PTCH1 overlaps with that of SHH (teal). The switch helix, highlighted in violet, is sandwiched by CDR1 and CDR3 of TI23. (E, F) The interactions between TI23 CDRs and PTCH1 are shown in detail. CDR1 is colored in orange, CDR3 is colored in green, and the switch helix is colored in \n\n violet. The hydrophobic interactions from CDR1 are viewed from above the membrane in e, whereas the hydrogen bond interactions from CDR3 are viewed from the ECD2 side of PTCH1 protein as in F. [0019] Figure 3. Conformational change induced by TI23. (A) Overlay of the structures of murine PTCH1 alone (PDB ID: 6mg8) or in complex with TI23 shows two major changes in the extracellular domain. The extracellular domain 2 between TM7 and TM8 turns around 5<sup>o</sup> pi",
    "tarity determining region\u201d (CDR), comprises loops which differ extensively in size and sequence based on antigen recognition. CDRs are generally responsible for the binding specificity of the nanobody. Distinct from the CDRs is the framework region. The framework region is relatively conserved and assists in overall protein structure. The framework region may comprise a large solvent-exposed surface consisting of a ^-sheet and loop structure. A signal sequence, as known in the art, can be included, which is then cleaved from the mature nanobody. [0039] The present disclosure provides for nanobodies that bind to patched and activate the hedgehog signaling pathway. The nanobodies comprise an single variable region antigen binding domain (ABD). As used herein, the term ABD refers to the variable region polypeptide that specifically binds to the desired antigen. An ABD is the minimum fragment that contains a complete antigen-recognition and binding site, in the present invention as a single polypeptide. It is in this configuration that the CDRS of the variable domain define an antigen-binding site on the surface of the domain. Examples of nanobodies include those set forth herein, including without limitation SEQ ID NO:10; and SEQ ID NO:18-23, particularly SEQ ID NO:23. [0040] Determination of affinity for the antigen can be performed using methods known in the art, e.g. Biacore measurements, etc. Members of the nanobody family may have an affinity for the cognate antigen with a Kd of from about 10<sup>-7</sup> to around about 10<sup>-11</sup>, including without limitation: from about 10<sup>-7</sup> to around about 10<sup>-10</sup>; from about 10<sup>-7</sup> to around about 10<sup>-9</sup>; from about 10<sup>-7</sup> to around about 10<sup>-8</sup>; from about 10<sup>-8</sup> to around about 10<sup>-11</sup>; from about 10<sup>-8</sup> to around about 10<sup>-10</sup>; from about 10<sup>-8</sup> to around about 10<sup>-9</sup>; from about 10<sup>-9</sup> to around about 10<sup>-11</sup>; from about 10<sup>-9</sup> to around about 10<sup>-10</sup>; or any value within these ranges. The affinity selection may be confirmed with a biological assessment for activity in, for example, and in vitro or pre-clinical model, and assessment of potential toxicity. [0041] A nanobody or ABD \u201cwhich binds\u201d an antigen of interest, is one that binds the antigen with sufficient affinity such that the nanobody or binding molecule is useful as a diagnostic and/or therapeutic agent in targeting the antigen, and does not significantly cross-react with other proteins. In such embodiments, the extent of binding of the nanobody or other binding molecule to a non-targeted antigen will usually be no more than 10% as determined by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis or radioimmunoprecipitation (RIA). \n\n[0042] A \u201cfunctional\u201d or \u201cbiologically active\u201d nanobody or antigen-binding molecule is one capable of exerting one or more of its natural activities in structural,",
    "d along with the host genome. Moreover, certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operably linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as \n\n \u201crecombinant expression vectors\u201d (or simply, \u201crecombinant vectors\u201d). In general, expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In the present specification, \u201cplasmid\u201d and \u201cvector\u201d may be used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of vector. [0055] The term \u201chost cell\u201d (or \u201crecombinant host cell\u201d), as used herein, is intended to refer to a cell that has been genetically altered, or is capable of being genetically altered by introduction of an exogenous polynucleotide, such as a recombinant plasmid or vector. It should be understood that such terms are intended to refer not only to the particular subject cell but to the progeny of such a cell. Because certain modifications may occur in succeeding generations due to either mutation or environmental influences, such progeny may not, in fact, be identical to the parent cell, but are still included within the scope of the term \u201chost cell\u201d as used herein. [0056] \u201cBinding affinity\u201d generally refers to the strength of the sum total of noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., an nanobody or other binding molecule) and its binding partner (e.g., an antigen or receptor). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (Kd). Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art, including those described herein. Low-affinity antibodies bind antigen (or receptor) weakly and tend to dissociate readily, whereas high-affinity antibodies bind antigen (or receptor) more tightly and remain bound longer. [0057] In an embodiment, affinity is determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR), e.g. as used by Biacore systems. The affinity of one molecule for another molecule is determined by measuring the binding kinetics of the interaction, e.g. at 25<sup>o</sup>C. [0058] The terms \"active agent,\" \u201cantagonist\u201d, \"inhibitor\", \"drug\" and \"pharmacologically active agent\" are used interchangeably herein to refer to a chemical material or compound which, when administered to an organism (human or animal) induces a desired pharmacologic and/or physiologic effect by local and/or systemic action. [0059] As used herein, the terms \u201ctreatment,\u201d \u201ctreating,\u201d and the like, refer to obtaining a desired pharmacologic and/or physiologic effect. The effect may be prophylactic in terms of completely or partially preventing a disease or symptom thereof and/or may be therapeutic in terms of a partial or complete cure for a disease and/or adverse effect attributable to the disease. \u201cTreatment,\u201d as used herein, covers any treatment of a disease in a mammal, particularly in a human, and includes: (a) preventing the disease or a symptom of a disease from occurring in a subject which may be predisposed to the disease but has ",
    "rotein molecules were selected from 2D classification. These particles were then reconstructed ab initio, and then classified with heterogeneous refinement into 3 classes, using two copies of the map generated from the last step plus one junk map as the initial models. The best class was chosen for homogeneous refinement and then non-uniform refinement to obtain a map at 4.1 \u00c5. The particles were then analyzed with the 3D variability analysis tool and the two extremes of the first eigenvector were used as the basis for further 3D classification. The final 3D class was refined with non-uniform refinement to a resolution of 3.7 \u00c5. The particle stack was then exported to cisTEM using the scripts in pyEM. After one iteration of local refinement with a mask excluding the detergent micelle, a map was reported at 3.4 \u00c5. The final map after sharpening was used for model building. [00140] Protein model building. Nanobody TI23 structure was generated with rosettaCM using 4mqtB and 5m30F as the template structures. The generated structure and the previously determined PTCH1 structure (6mg8) were docked into the cryo-EM map and refined in phenix.real_space_refine with morphing. The refined model was then edited manually in coot, to add in residues that are now resolved in the new structure, and the small molecules. The constraints for small molecules were generated on the PRODRG server. The entire structure was then refined in phenix.real_space_refine. <sup>[00141]</sup> FACS-based ShhN binding assay.293 cells were transiently transfected with GFP-tagged Ptch1 constructs. After 24 hours, cells were dissociated using 10 mM EDTA, washed with HPBS 0.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and pelleted by centrifugation. Cells were then resuspended in binding buffer (HPBS, 0.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, 0.5 mg/ml BSA) and incubated with purified ShhN-biotin (1:400 dilution) for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. Cells were then washed three times in binding buffer by centrifugation and subsequently incubated with Alexa Fluor 647 streptavidin conjugate (Invitrogen) for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. Cells were then washed three times by centrifugation in wash buffer (binding buffer plus 1 mM biotin) and the percentages of cells bound by ShhN were quantified by flow cytometry after gating for PTCH1-GFP expression (BD FACSAria II, Stanford Stem Cell Institute FACS Core). \n\n[00142] Gli-dependent luciferase assay. The luciferase assay was performed in Ptch1<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs, as previously described. Ptch1<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs were seeded into 24-well plates and then transfected with various plasmids along with a mixture containing 8xGli firefly luciferase and SV40-renilla luciferase plasmids. For each well, 2ng (0.4%) plasmid encoding Ptch1-B variants, or 5ng (1%) plasmid encoding full-length PTCH1 was used. When cells were confluent, they were shifted to DMEM with 0.5% serum containing ShhN-conditioned medium or control medium and incubated for 48 hr. Luciferase activity was then measured using a Berthold Centro XS3"
