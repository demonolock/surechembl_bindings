    "red for 120 h. For endpoint detection, the CellTiter-Glo reagent was melted, and the cell plate was moved to room temperature to equilibrate for 30 minutes, added with 100 \u00b5L of CellTiter-Glo to each well, and shaken on an orbital shaker for 5 minutes to fully lyse the cells. The plate was kept at room temperature for 20 minutes to stabilize the luminescence signal, and the luminescence value of each well was full wavelength scanned with a multi-functional microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Spectramax M3 microplate reader).</p>[Test samples] The compounds of Examples 1-39, and reference compound A\n<img id=\"ib0141\" path=\"imgb0141.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/1156719242/EP/20230913/A1/000004/24/22/07/imgb0141.tif\"/>\n(prepared and characterized according to the method described in WO2020/081282 A1</patcit>) and reference compound B\n<img id=\"ib0142\" path=\"imgb0142.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/1156719244/EP/20230913/A1/000004/24/22/07/imgb0142.tif\"/>\n(prepared and characterized according to the method described in WO2015054572</patcit>).</p>[Data Analysis] The following formula was used to calculate the cell inhibition rate under the action of each concentration of the compounds: Inhibitionrate%=1\u2212LumDrugtobetested\u2212LumCulturemediumcontrol/LumCellcontrol\u2212LumCulturemediumcontrol\u00d7100%<img id=\"ib0143\" path=\"imgb0143.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/1156719246/EP/20230913/A1/000004/24/22/07/imgb0143.tif\"/> IC50 values were calculated using GraphPad Prism 7.0 software, nonlinear Sigmoidal regression was used to fit the data to obtain a dose-response curve.</p>[Experimental results] The compounds of the present disclosure showed satisfactory anti-cell proliferation activities on NCI-H358 human non-small cell lung cancer cells with KRas G12C mutation. Specifically, the examples tested all showed anti-proliferation activities, and the IC<sub>50</sub> values are generally &lt;1 \u00b5M, such as &lt;0.5 \u00b5M, &lt;0.1 \u00b5M, preferably &lt;50 nM, more preferably &lt;20 nM, most preferably &lt;10 nM, such as Examples 17, 20, 32, 33, 34, and 37 all showed an IC<sub>50</sub> value of &lt;50nM, and Examples 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 and 39 showed an IC<sub>50</sub> value of &lt;20nM. The data for some representative Examples are shown in Table 1.\nTable 1.
