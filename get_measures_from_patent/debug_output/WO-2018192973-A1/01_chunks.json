    "on transport from the cells into the blood circulation and the inhibition of iron absorption in the intestine. Therein, the inhibition of iron \n\n transport and/or iron reflux may be effected by different ways of mechanism, comprising for example inhibition of iron transport activity of ferroportin and thus inhibition of iron reflux, triggering internalization, degradation and/or reduction of ferroportin, administering hepcidin agonists, i.e. compounds which compete with hepcidin or by compounds, which inhibit the binding of hepcidin to ferroportin. </p> Ferroportin inhibition may be determined by measuring the inhibition of ferroportin mediated iron transport activity in an iron response assay (BLAzer-Assay), as described in more detail in the Examples below. Further, ferroportin inhibition may be determined by measuring ferroportin internalization and/or degradation in the Ferroportin Internalization and Degradation Assay (FACS) or by examining the Ferroportin Ubiquitination and Degradation, each as described in more detail in the Examples below. Further, ferroportin inhibition may be determined by measuring the activity as an hepcidin agonist, for example by determining the Hepcidin binding capacity to ferroportin in the Hepcidin Internalization Assay (J774), as described in more detail in the Examples below. Further, ferroportin inhibition may be determined by confirming the inhibition of hepcidin binding to ferroportin, for example in the Biophysical Ferroportin-Hepcidin Binding Assay (Hep Bind FP), as described in more detail in the Examples below. Further, ferroportin inhibition may be determined by determining the activity of a compound regarding its ability to block iron export via ferroportin, for example with a test for measuring inhibition of iron efflux, as described in more detail in the Examples below. </p> Ferroportin inhibition in the sense of the present invention can thus in particular be defined by exhibiting a ferroportin inhibiting activity in at least one of the aforementioned test methods, shown in particular by: </p> Inhibition of ferroportin mediated iron transport activity in an iron response assay (Blazer Assay): IC<sub>50</sub> value [\u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9] of not more than 100 (\u2264 100), preferably not more than 50 (\u2264 50), more preferably below 50 (&lt; 50). </p> Ferroportin Internalization and Degradation Assay (FACS): : EC<sub>50</sub> value [\u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9] of not more than 100 (&lt; 100), preferably not more than 50 (&lt; 50), more preferably below 50 (&lt; 50). </p> Ferroportin Ubiquitination and Degradation: visually inspected effect in Western blots of \"+ comparable to hepcidin\", \"+/- intermediate effect\" and \"+ / +/- stronger intermediate effect\", preferred is an effect \"+\" or \"+ / + / -\", most preferred is an effect \"+\" . </p> Hepcidin Internalization Assay (J774): IC<sub>50</sub> value of not more than 100 (&lt; 100), preferably not more than 50 (&lt; 50), more preferably below 50 (&lt; 50). </p> Biophysical Ferroportin-Hepcidin Binding Assay: : IC<sub>50</sub> value of not more than 100 (&lt; 100), preferably not more than 50 (&lt; 50), more preferably below 50 (&lt; 50). </p> Inhibition of Iron Efflux: IC<sub>50</sub> value of not more than 100 (&lt; 100), preferably not more than 50 (&lt; 50), more preferably below 50 (&lt; 50). </p> Ferroportin inhibition may further be determined in in vivo models, as described in more detail in the Examples below. Suitable in vivo models may comprise, for example, examination of hypoferremia in naive mice via measurement of serum iron reduction; examination of prevention of iron absorption in anemic rats via measurement of serum iron inhibition; examination of correction of hyperferremia in beta2-microglobulin deficient mice via measurement of serum iron reduction; examination of prevention of iron overload in beta2-microglobulin deficient mice via measurement of total iron in spleen or liver; examination of improvement of anemia, ineffective erythropoiesis and iron overload in a mouse model of \u03b2-thalassemia intermedia. </p> The activity of the salts of the present invention as ferroportin inhibitors can in particular be determined by the methods as described in the Examples below. </p> As further already explained above, ferroportin inhibition may for example be effected by hepcidin, which is thus an essential regulating factor of iron absorption, inhibiting ferroportin and thus blocking iron transport from the cells into the blood circulation and iron absorpt",

Image analysis include detection of nuclei (Hoechst 33342 fluorescence), identification of cell- associated regions, application of a virtual channel and thresholding for rolling-ball-type background reduction, followed by application of the Sum(Mean) algorithm to measure the TMR fluorescence associated with cells as a quantitative measure for internalized TMR- hepcidin. IC<sub>50</sub> values are calculated with the Sum(Mean) raw data using \"log(inhibitor) vs. response\" curve fitting of Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software Inc., version 5.02). For each data set the fit of the \"log(inhibitor) vs. response (three parameters)\" model is compared to the fit of the \"log(inhibitor) vs. response - Variable slope (four parameters)\" model and the IC<sub>50</sub> data of the preferred model is used.

Biophysical Ferroportin-Hepcidin Binding Assay </p> This biophysical assay was developed to confirm inhibition of hepcidin binding to ferroportin (Fpn) more directly. Incubation of TMR-hepcidin with purified human Fpn isolated from Pichia pastoris yeast cells expressing human Fpn with a C-terminal FLAG affinity tag (Bonaccorsi di Patti, 2014) leads to increased fluorescence polarization (FP) of the TMR-hepcidin ligand. Small molecular weight Fpn inhibitors are tested for inhibition of binding of TMR-hepcidin to Fpn, as detected by dose-dependent decrease of the TMR FP signal, as described in detail below. </p> A mixture of 1 .3 \u03bc\u039c human Fpn and 30 nM TMR-hepcidin in FP assay buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCI pH 7.3, 200 mM NaCI, 0.02% DDM, 0.1 % BSA is plated into a 384 well black low volume round bottom plate (Corning, Cat. 3677) at 16 \u03bc\u0399 per well. 8 \u03bc\u0399 of serial dilutions of test compounds are added in duplicates to reach final Fpn and TMR-hepcidin concentrations of 1 \u03bc\u039c and 20 nM, respectively. Plates are incubated for 90 minutes at room temperature and parallel (S) and \n\n perpendicular (P) fluorescence is measured in a Synergy H1 fluorescence reader (BioTek). FP values are calculated in mP according to the following formula. \n<img id=\"imgf000071_0001\" path=\"imgf000071_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/462476845/WO/20181025/A1/002018/19/29/73/imgf000071_0001.tif\"/>\n </p> IC<sub>50</sub> values are determined with the calculated mP values as described for the hepcidin internalization assay and are listed in Table 2. The IC<sub>50</sub> of unlabeled hepcidin in this assay is 0.37 \u00b1 0.067 \u03bc\u039c. </p>Table 2 Average (AVE) IC<sub>50</sub> data of Fpn inhibitors tested in the biophysical hepcidin-ferroportin binding assay is shown for multiple measurements. </p> Table 2 </p><img id=\"imgf000071_0002\" path=\"imgf000071_0002.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/462476926/WO/20181025/A1/002018/19/29/73/imgf000071_0002.tif\"/></p> 3. Inhibition of Ferroportin mediated Iron Export Activity in an Iron Response Assay </p> Intracellular iron levels are indirectly measured in this assay by monitoring the activity of a beta- lactamase (BLA) reporter gene fused to the human ferritin promoter and the associated iron regulatory element (IRE) contained within the 5' untranslated region of the ferritin mRNA. Expression of ferroportin (Fpn) in such a cell line leads to iron efflux and lower iron levels as reflected by lower activity of the reporter gene. On the other hand, inhibition of Fpn-mediated iron efflux results in elevated cellular iron levels which is detected as increased reporter gene activity. Small molecular weight Fpn inhibitor compounds are tested for dose-dependent effects in this in vitro iron response assay as described below. </p> The HEK-293 cell line #354 is generated by stable integration of (i) a human Fpn-GFP fusion construct inserted in a derivative of the doxycycline-inducible pTRE-Tight-BI plasmid (Clontech, Cat. 631068) and (ii) a human ferritin promoter-BLA reporter gene into a derivative of the HEK-293 Tet-ON Advanced cell line (Clontech). To generate the ferritin-BLA reporter gene construct, a 1.4 kb fragment of the human ferritin H promoter is ampl",

J774 cells were incubated overnight with Fe(lll)-NTA to induce expression of Fpn. Cells were then treated with ca. 10-fold IC<sub>50</sub> concentrations, as determined in the hepcidin internalization assay (see Table 1 ), of hepcidin (Hepcidin, 150 nM) or Fpn inhibitors Example Compound No. 208 (210 nM), Example Compound No. 167 (1.5 \u03bc\u039c), Example Compound No. 127 (120 nM), Example Compound No. 152 (40 nM) for 10 or 120 min before harvesting and immunoprecipitation with the anti-Fpn antibody F308. Mock treated cells were harvested after 120 min (Control). </p> Immunoblotting of immunoprecipitates with the anti-Fpn antibody MTP1 revealed disappearance of ferroportin 120 min after treatment with the Fpn inhibitors, to a similar extent as in the sample treated with hepcidin (upper panel). Rapid ubiquitination of Fpn was observed 10 min after treatment of cells with Fpn inhibitors and hepcidin. Protein molecular weight standards are indicated on the left in kD. </p>6. Inhibition of Iron Efflux by Ferroportin Inhibitors </p> The activity of hepcidin and ferroportin inhibitor compounds regarding their ability to block iron export via ferroportin is tested on T47D cells (ECACC, Cat. 85102201 ) as described below. </p> Cells are plated in 24-well plates (Greiner, Cat. 662160) containing 350\u038c00 cells/well and incubated overnight with 100 \u03bc\u039c <sup>58</sup>Fe (<sup>58</sup>Fe(ll)-Sulfate, Vifor Pharma Batch No. ROR 3085) in 500 \u03bc\u039c L-Ascorbic Acid (Sigma Aldrich, Cat. 795437) containing growth medium. Cells are washed once with 500 \u03bc\u0399 iron uptake buffer (IUB; PIPES 40mM, Cat. P1851 , Glucose Monohydrate 10 mM, Cat. 49158, Sodium Chloride 260 mM, Cat. 71379, Potassium Chloride 20 mM, Cat.
