    "ds to the conditions of precipitation from the acid at elevated temperature - it is accessible at a pH between 2-6 and 50 to 85 <sup>0</sup> C.</p>In addition to the product features:</p>Surprisingly, the required goal can be achieved by the inventive method, which requires no expensive or complicated process or process stages and is very fast, with a combination of simple process steps, in particular, the necessary equipment is also inexpensive in - Purchase and operation.  It is very advantageous that no chemical additives must be used in the process, such as enzymes, disinfectants, brighteners.</p>It is also surprising in terms of product characteristics or properties that not only proteins with a particular molecular weight range are isolated by the fractionation, but also a fraction which has all the required properties: highly nutritive, neutral color, no pronounced plant, for example potato flavor , low levels of lysinoalanine, low glycoalkaloids and technological functionalities such as water binding and oil binding (emulsifier). This is particularly surprising because the precipitated protein fraction is almost insoluble in water.</p>The invention will now be explained in more detail with reference to embodiments, to which it is by no means limited.</p>The process conditions for the first stage, the first fractionation step, are: room temperature to 50 <sup>\u00b0</sup> C., pH 2 - 7, separator as centrifuge. This thus separated protein fraction with a MW of about 100-600 kD is suitable, for example, as a normal animal feed, as currently. Most, unseparated potato protein is used. Typically, proteins associated with non-proteinaceous molecules, such as glycoproteins, phosphoproteins, lipoproteins, metal-complexed proteins, etc., but also the largest proportion of glycoalkaloids and polyphenols are separated under these conditions together with the high-molecular potato protein.</p>In the second stage, the removal of the target fraction is carried out by precipitation at pH 2-6, preferably pH 3.5 to 5.5 and 50-85 <sup>0</sup> C, preferably 75 to 85 <sup>0</sup> C, separation of the precipitated potato protein fraction from the potato juice with decanter centrifuge , A peculiarity of the potato protein is that the more acidic the pH is adjusted, the more protein is precipitated. For all other proteins, both vegetable and animal, precipitation is at the isoelectric point  maximum and also of the \"flake texture\" ago optimal. For potato protein in potato juice, this is pH 5.4, which is almost the native pH of potato juice (pH 5.6).</p>Potato protein has a second peculiarity: heat coagulation, above 40 <sup>0</sup> C <sub>1</sub> is irreversible in potato protein. The parameters also ensure the microbiological purity of the product, so there is no need for additional pasteurization. It does not use high to very high temperature and acidic environment, so little lysinoalanine is produced.</p>The protein product thus obtained had a protein content of a",
    "supplied before the second decanter and in the upper reaches of the first decanter from the process discharged.</p>The potato protein fraction prepared according to the invention avoids the above-described disadvantages of known potato proteins (color, bitterness, allergenicity, glycoalkaloids, antinutritic cleavage products, intrinsic taste, lack of functionality) by washing out or joint separation of these substances with the proteins of the first stage. Antinutritiv could be some enzymes, here are again outstanding the protease inhibitors, which have, for example, in the potato tuber antibacterial functions. According to literature, these enzymes have a low MW, so it can be taken for granted that they are not included in the fraction described here. In addition, the heat treatment causes a denaturation and inactivation, which also indicates the low solubility of 2 to 5% of the protein fraction.  Pollutants: As pollutants occur in potatoes except, of course, the \"normal\" environmental toxins such as heavy metals and pesticides only glycoalkaloids (solanine, etc.). Their separation takes place in stage 1, as described above. An allergenic potential of such potato proteins is unknown and these</p>Potato protein fraction is therefore also suitable for the production of special allergen-free special herbal foods and cosmetics.</p>According to SDS-PAGE, the molecular weights of the various proteins of the potato protein fraction according to the invention are 14, 20, 22, 40, 97 kD. The fraction consists essentially of patatin (40 kD) and 20/22 kD, the rest is essentially negligible.</p>The potato protein fraction produced in this way had the following properties: max. 150 ppm glycoalkaloids max. 1% strength max. 1% sugar max. 1% crude fiber *</p>Isoelectric point: about pH 5.4 from 4.0 to 6.0, max. 5% ash:</p>Emulsifying capacity of 1: 4: 4 to 1: 4: 6</p>Solubility - 2% to 5% (in water at room temperature and also in hot water)</p>Water binding capacity: 1: 4 to 1: 5</p>Measurement of emulsifying capacity:</p>25 g of protein are suspended in 100 g of water with an Ultraturrax. Then, while further dispersing, add oil slowly and in portions (eg.  flowering oil, rapeseed oil, olive oil, etc.) until the emulsion breaks. The oil binding or emulsion capacity is given in relation to the 3 substances with the maximum oil binding. 1: 4: 6 means that a mixture of 1 part of protein and 4 parts of water can bind 6 parts of oil, ie after adding more than 150 g of oil in suspension, the test emulsion breaks down.</p>Water Binding Capacity:</p>5 g of protein are weighed into 95 g of water and the suspension is stirred for 1 h. It is then centrifuged (20 min., 3,500 g), the supernatant carefully poured off (possibly pipetting off the last residue) and the wet protein is weighed out.</p>(Wet weight - dry weight) / dry weight = water binding capacity</p>The amino acid composition of the thus-obtained potato protein fraction having a molecular weight between 14 and 97 kD was (variations typical of natural products):</p>AIa 3.7 - 3.9</p>Arg 3.9 to 4.4</p>Asp 9.8 to 12.6</p>Cys 1, 4 to 1, 7</p>Glu 8.9 to 9.5</p>GIy 4.7 to 5.0</p>His 1.9 to 2.3</p>JJe 4.9 to 5.4</p>Leu 8.6 to 9.6</p>Met 1, 7 to 1, 9</p>Phe 5.8 to 6.0</p>Pro 4.1 to 4.5</p>Ser 4.3 to 4.8  Their 4.6 to 5.2</p>Try 1, 0 to 1, 2</p>Tyr 4.6 to 5.0</p>Vai 5.9 to 6.9</p>Lys 7.3 to 7.4</p>Essential amino acids are underlined. The total content of essential amino acids is 40.8% to 43.1%. The sum of the amino acids in dry matter is 95.6%, in OS 91, 5%, crude protein (N * 6.25) 85.4% in the dry matter.</p>In this potato protein fraction, the high nutritional value of the potato protein is made accessible to humans, while at the same time making available to processors who produce made-up foods a protein offering the mentioned technological advantages.</p>At higher temperatures, the protein is excessively damaged and its valuable properties, which make it so useful in food applications, are increasingly destroyed: neutral taste, light color, solubility, all other functionalities as well, the structure is keratinized and digestibility decreases. What remains in the potato fruit juice is the protein fraction, which remains soluble even under these conditions.</p>Production of potato protein</p>50 kg Saturna potatoes were washed, ground in a mill, and the potato fruit juice was obtained by pressing the grated egg in a centrifuge with the addition of sodium bisulfite. 25 l of this potato fruit"
