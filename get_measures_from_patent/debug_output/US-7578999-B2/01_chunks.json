Three disulphide bonds that form the cystine-knot are illustrated as solid lines. An extra disulphide bond, shown by a dotted line, is unique to this family, which connects two \u03b2-hairpin tips in the 3D structure. The polypeptides depicted are SOST: sclerostin (SEQ ID NO:126); CGHB: Human Chorionic Gonadotropin \u03b2 (SEQ ID NO:127); FSHB: follicle-stimulating hormone beta subunit (SEQ ID NO:128); TSHB: thyrotropin beta chain precursor (SEQ ID NO:129); VWF: Von Willebrand factor (SEQ ID NO:130); MUC2: human mucin 2 precursor (SEQ ID NO:131); CER1: Cerberus 1 (Xenopus laevis homolog) (SEQ ID NO:132); DRM: gremlin (SEQ ID NO:133); DAN: (SEQ ID NO:134); CTGF: connective tissue growth factor precursor (SEQ ID NO:135); NOV: NovH (nephroblastoma overexpressed gene protein homolog) (SEQ ID NO:136); CYR6: (SEQ ID NO:137).</p>FIG. 8 illustrates a 3D model of the core region of SOST (SOST_Core).</p>FIG. 9 presents a 3D model of the core region of SOST homodimer.</p>FIGS. 10A and 10B provide an amino acid sequence alignment of Noggin from five different animals: human (NOGG_HUMAN (SEQ ID NO:138); chicken (NOGG_CHICK, SEQ ID NO:139); African clawed frog (NOGG_XENLA, SEQ ID NO:140); NOGG_FUGRU, SEQ ID NO:141); and zebrafish (NOGG_ZEBRA, SEQ ID NO:142); and SOST from human (SOST_HUMAN, SEQ ID NO:46), ",
    " which animal is producing antibodies that impair or block binding of SOST to a TGF-beta protein. Antibodies are then prepared from such identified immunized animals according to methods known in the art and described herein.</p>Antibodies which inhibit the binding of TGF-beta binding-protein to a TGF-beta family member may readily be prepared given the disclosure provided herein. Particularly useful are anti-TGF-beta binding-protein antibodies that \u201cspecifically bind\u201d TGF-beta binding-protein of SEQ ID NOs: 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 46, or 65, but not to other TGF-beta binding-proteins such as Dan, Cerberus, SCGF, or Gremlin. Within the context of the present invention, antibodies are understood to include monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, single chain, chimeric, CDR-grafted immunoglobulings, anti-idiotypic antibodies, and antibody fragments thereof (e.g., Fab, Fd, Fab\u2032, and F(ab\u2032)<sub>2</sub>, Fv variable regions, or complementarity determining regions). As discussed above, antibodies are understood to be specific against TGF-beta binding-protein, or against a specific TGF-beta family member, if they bind with a K<sub>a </sub>of greater than or equal to 10<sup>7 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>, preferably greater than or equal to 10<sup>8 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>, and do not bind to other TGF-beta binding-proteins, or bind with a K<sub>a </sub>of less than or equal to 10<sup>6 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>. Affinity of an antibody for its cognate antigen is also commonly expressed as a dissociation constant K<sub>D</sub>, and an anti-SOST antibody specifically binds to a TGF-beta family member if it binds with a K<sub>D </sub>of less than or equal to about 10<sup>\u22125 </sup>M, more preferably less than or equal to about 10<sup>\u22126 </sup>M, still more preferably less than or equal to 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, and still more preferably less than or equal to 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M. Furthermore, antibodies of the present invention preferably block, impair, or inhibit (e.g., decrease with statistical significance) the binding of TGF-beta binding-protein to a TGF-beta family member. The affinity of a monoclonal antibody or binding partner, as well as inhibition of binding can be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art (see Scatchard, Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 51:660-672, 1949). Affinity may also be determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR; BIAcore, Biosensor, Piscataway, N.J.). For surface plasmon resonance, target molecules are immobilized on a solid phase and exposed to ligands in a mobile phase running along a flow cell. If ligand binding to the immobilized target occurs, the local refractive index changes, leading to a change in SPR angle, which can be monitored in real time by detecting changes in the intensity of the reflected light. The rates of change of the SPR signal can be analyzed to yield apparent rate constants for the association and dissociation phases of the binding reaction. The ratio of these values gives the apparent equilibrium constant (affin",

There was no antigen cross-reactivity observed for any of the antigens tested.</p>Example 5Interaction of Beer with TGF-Beta Super-Family ProteinsThe interaction of Beer with proteins from different phylogenetic arms of the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily were studied using immunoprecipitation methods. Purified TGF\u03b2-1, TGF\u03b2-2, TGF\u03b2-3, BMP-4, BMP-5, BMP-6 and GDNF were obtained from commerical sources (R&amp;D systems; Minneapolis, Minn.). A representative protocol is as follows. Partially purified Beer was dialyzed into HEPES buffered saline (25 mM HEPES 7.5, 150 mM NaCl). Immunoprecipitations were done in 300 ul of IP buffer (150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1.4 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% triton\u00d7100, and 10% glycerol). 30 ng recombinant human BMP-5 protein (R&amp;D systems) was applied to 15 ul of FLAG affinity matrix (Sigma; St Louis Mo.)) in the presence and absence of 500 ng FLAG epitope-tagged Beer. The proteins were incubated for 4 hours @ 4\u00b0 C. and then the affinity matrix-associated proteins were washed 0.5 times in IP buffer (1 ml per wash). The bound proteins were eluted from the affinity matrix in 60 microliters of 1\u00d7 SDS PAGE sample buffer. The proteins were resolved by SDS PAGE and Beer associated BMP-5 was detected by western blot using anti-BMP-5 antiserum (Research Diagnostics, Inc) (see FIG. 5).</p>BEER Ligand Binding Assay:</p>FLAG-Beer protein (20 ng) is added to 100 ul PBS/0.2% BSA and adsorbed into each well of 96 well microtiter plate previously coated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma; St Louis Mo.) and blocked with 10% BSA in PBS. This is conducted at room temperature for 60 minutes. This protein solution is removed and the wells are washed to remove unbound protein. BMP-5 is added to each well in concentrations ranging from 10 pM to 500 nM in PBS/0.2% BSA and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. The binding solution is removed and the plate washed with three times with 200 ul volumes of PBS/0.2% BSA. BMP-5 levels are then detected using BMP-5 antiserum via ELISA (F. M. Ausubel et al (1998) Current Protocols in Mol. Biol. Vol 2 11.2.1-11.2.22). Specific binding is calculated by subtracting non-specific binding from total binding and analyzed by the LIGAND program (Munson and Podbard, Anal. Biochem., 107, p220-239, (1980).</p>In a variation of this method, Beer is engineered and expressed as a human Fc fusion protein. Likewise the ligand BMP is engineered and expressed as mouse Fc fusion. These proteins are incubated together and the assay conducted as described by Mellor et al using homogeneous time resolved fluorescence detection (G. W. Mellor et al., J. of Biomol Screening, 3(2) 91-99, 1998).</p>Example 6Screening Assay for Inhibition of TGF-Beta Binding-Protein Binding to TGF-Beta Family MembersThe assay described above is replicated with two exceptions. First, BMP concentration is held fixed at the Kd determined previously. Second, a collection of antagonist candidates is added at a fixed concentration (20 uM in the case of the small organic molecule collections and 1 uM in antibody studies). These candidate molecules (antagonists) of TGF-beta binding-protein binding include organic compounds derived from commercial or internal collections representing diverse chemical structures. These compounds are prepared as stock solutions in DMSO and are added to assay wells at \u22661% of final volume under the standard assay conditions. These are incubated for 2 hours at room temperature with the BMP and Beer, the solution removed and the bound BMP is quantitated as described. Agents that inhibit 40% of the BMP binding observed in the absence of compound or antibody are considered antagonists of this interaction. These are further evaluated as potential inhibitors based on titration studies to determine their inhibition constants and their influence on TGF-beta binding-protein binding affinity. Comparable specificity control assays may also be conducted to establish the selectivity profile for the identified antagonist through studies using assays dependent on the BMP ligand action (e.g. BMP/BMP receptor competition study).</p>Example 7Inhibition of TGF-Beta Binding-Protein Localization to Bone MatrixEvaluation of inhibition of localization to bone matrix (hydroxyapatite) is conducted using modifications to the method of Nicolas (Nicolas, V. Calcif Tissue Int 57:206, 1995). Briefly, ",
    " three times with 200 \u03bcl volumes of PBS/0.2% BSA. Binding of the BMP to sclerostin is detected using polyclonal antiserum or monoclonal antibody specific for the BMP and an appropriate enzyme-conjugated second step reagent according to standard ELISA techniques (see, e.g., Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Mol. Biol. Vol 2 11.2.1-11.2.22 (1998)). Specific binding is calculated by subtracting non-specific binding from total binding and analyzed using the LIGAND program (Munson and Podbard, Anal. Biochem. 107:220-39 (1980)).</p>Binding of sclerostin to a BMP is also detected by homogeneous time resolved fluorescence detection (Mellor et al., J Biomol. Screening, 3:91-99 (1998)). A polynucleotide sequence encoding sclerostin is operatively linked to a human immunoglobulin constant region in a recombinant nucleic acid construct and expressed as a human Fc-sclerostin fusion protein according to methods known in the art and described herein. Similarly, a BMP ligand is engineered and expressed as a BMP-mouse Fc fusion protein. These two fusion proteins are incubated together and the assay conducted as described by Mellor et al.</p>Example 15Screening Assay for Antibodies that Inhibit Binding of TGF-Beta Family Members to TGF-Beta Binding ProteinThis example describes a method for detecting an antibody that inhibits binding of a TGF-beta family member to sclerostin. An ELISA is performed essentially as described in Example 14 except that the BMP concentration is held fixed at its Kd (determined, for example, by BIAcore analysis). In addition, an antibody or a library or collection of antibodies is added to the wells to a concentration of 1 \u03bcM. Antibodies are incubated for 2 hours at room temperature with the BMP and sclerostin, the solution removed, and the bound BMP is quantified as described (see Example 14). Antibodies that inhibit 40% of the BMP binding observed in the absence of antibody are considered antagonists of this interaction. These antibodies are further evaluated as potential inhibitors by performing titration studies to determine their inhibition constants and their effect on TGF-beta binding-protein binding affinity. Comparable specificity control assays may also be conducted to establish the selectivity profile for the identified antagonist using assays dependent on the BMP ligand action (e.g., a BMP/BMP receptor competition study).</p>Example 16Inhibition of TGF-Beta Binding-Protein Localization to Bone MatrixEvaluation of inhibition of localization to bone matrix (hydroxyapatite) is conducted using modifications to the method of Nicolas (Calcif. Tissue Int. 57:206-12 (1995)). Briefly, <sup>125</sup>I-labelled TGF-beta binding-protein is prepared as described by Nicolas (supra). Hydroxyapatite is added to each well of a 96-well microtiter plate equipped with a polypropylene filtration membrane (Polyfiltroninc, Weymouth Mass.). TGF-beta binding-protein diluted in 0.2% albumin in PBS buffer is then added to the wells. The wells containing matrix are washed 3 times with 0.2% albumin in PBS buffer. Adsorbed TGF-beta binding-protein is eluted using 0.3 M NaOH and then quantified.</p>An antibody that inhibits or impairs binding of the sclerostin TGF-beta binding protein to the hydroxyapatite is identified by incubating the TGF-beta binding protein with the antibody and applying the mixture to the matrix as described above. The matrix is washed 3 times with 0.2% albumin in PBS buffer. Adsorbed sclerostin is eluted with 0.3 M NaOH and then quantified. An antibody that inhibits the level of binding of sclerostin to the hydroxyapatite by at least 40% compared to the level of binding observed in the absence of antibody is considered a bone localization inhibitor. Such an antibody is further characterized in dose response studies to determine its inhibition constant and its effect on TGF-beta binding-protein binding affinity.</p>From the foregoing, although specific embodiments of the invention have been described herein for purposes of illustration, various modifications may be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is not limited except as by the appended claims.</p>"
