    " examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention.</p>Example 1: preparation of atomized inhalant of interferon alpha 2 beta and exosomes</p>An aerosol inhalation of interferon alpha 2 beta with exosomes was prepared. Recombinant human interferon alpha 2 beta injection (Kaine probiotics) is derived from Beijing Kaine science and technology Co., ltd, specification: 0.5ml: 5X 10 <sup>6</sup> IU. The exosomes were extracted from stem cells by the above method, assisted with physiological saline, and had a final volume of 2ml. The different preparation concentrations of interferon alpha 2 beta and exosome aerosol inhalants are summarized in table 1 below:</p> TABLE 1 preparation of aerosol inhalants of Interferon alpha 2 beta and exosomes concentration </p></p>Example 2: molecular weight detection results of interferon alpha 2 beta after mixing interferon alpha 2 beta with stem cell exosomes</p>An atomized formulation mixture was prepared according to the method of example 1, and placed at 4\u2103for 12 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours, respectively, and sampled, according to the molecular weight measurement method of interferon alpha prescribed in the \"Chinese pharmacopoeia 2020 edition (four parts)\". According to the method (general rule 0541, fifth method). The gel concentration of the separation gel is 15% by the reduction SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis method, the sample loading amount is not less than 1.0 mug, the molecular mass of the product is 19.2 kD+/-1.9 kD, and the results are shown in Table 2:</p> TABLE 2 molecular weight detection results of interferon alpha 2 beta and aerosol inhalants of exosomes </p></p>Example 3: determination of Interferon Activity after mixing Interferon alpha 2 beta with Stem cell exosomes</p>An atomized preparation mixture was prepared as in example 1, and the mixture was left at 4\u2103for 12 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours, and sampled, respectively, and the activity of interferon alpha 2 beta was measured according to the \"test for biological activity of interferon\" prescribed in the \"Chinese pharmacopoeia 2020 edition (four division)\". The measurement results are shown in the following table 3:</p> TABLE 3 determination of Activity of Interferon after mixing Interferon alpha 2 beta with Stem cell exosomes </p></p>Example 4: determination of particle concentration of exosomes after mixing Interferon alpha 2 beta with Stem cell exosomes</p>An atomized formulation mixture was prepared according to the method of example 1, and was left at 4\u2103for 12 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours, respectively, sampled, and assayed for exosome particle concentration using the NanoFCM method, and the results of the assay are shown in Table 4 below.</p>TABLE 4 determination of particle concentration of exosomes after mixing Interferon alpha 2 beta with Stem cell exosomes</p></p>Example 5: determination of average particle size of exosome particles after mixing Interferon alpha 2 beta with Stem cell exosome</p>An atomized formula"
