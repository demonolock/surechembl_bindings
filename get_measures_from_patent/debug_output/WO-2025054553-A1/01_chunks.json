    " constructs of this disclosure form dimers or higher order complexes (e.g., when the cell surface receptor aggregation results in a cap or patch), each event leading to internalization of constructs delivers at least twice the number of payload molecules to the cells as internalization of the monomeric \n\n Atty. Docket No.: 2974-6 PCT form of the construct. Accordingly, the dimeric form of the constructs offers an advantage in the delivery of payloads such as radioisotopes or chemotherapeutics over both the monomeric form of the construct and antibodies that are specific for epitopes appearing only once on a cell surface protein and do not facilitate cell surface molecule patching or capping. [0010] In addition to describing the constructs, the present disclosure also provides for methods of their preparation and methods of their use; including the use of the constructs to prepare a medicament and/or the use of the constructs for the purpose of treating a disease or a disorder (e.g., a cancer). IV. Brief Description of the Drawings [0011] FIG.1 provides at A a diagram of a construct of the present disclosure comprising an NBD with an ATP binding site, a scaffold domain (scaffold aa sequence), and an immune cell activating domain (AD) joined by linker sequences. The right side of the diagram in A also shows dimerization of the construct in the presence of a sufficient ATP concentration for the binding site to be substantially occupied (e.g., a concentration in the range of the Kd of ATP binding to the NBD or a higher concentration). At B, FIG.1 provides: (i) a first construct comprising a TSB, which is exemplified as a bivalent cell lineage or tumor-specific antibody but may be a monovalent binder such as an scFv or nanobody, and a first NBD of a heterodimerizing NBD pair joined by a linker; and (ii) a second construct comprising a second NBD of the heterodimerizing NBD pair joined by a linker. The right side of the diagram at B shows the formation of a heterodimer of the first and second constructs due to dimerization of the NBD domains in the presence of ATP. FIG.1 at C provides on the left side a construct of the present disclosure structured around an IgFc scaffold (a KiHs-s IgFc) that comprise a NBD on one polypeptide of the construct and an ICB, AD, or TSB on the other polypeptide. The construct is shown as optionally bearing one or more payloads or labels (e.g., a chemotherapeutic that may be bound by a labile (cleavable) linker or a radiolabel). The construct substantially dimerizes in the presence of ATP as shown on the right side (e.g., at levels found in a TME but not in non-tumor peripheral tissue). [0012] FIG.2 provides a series of constructs (structures A to E) comprising an NBD and an AD with the constructs of structures C, D, and E also comprising scaffold sequences that may be non-dimerizing or may be interspecific. The elements of each construct are joined by independently selected optional linkers. The figure also shows the forma",
    " \n\n Atty. Docket No.: 2974-6 PCT or other higher order complexes of such constructs do not form higher order complexes outside of the TME, they permit intratumoral stimulation of an immune response while limiting immune stimulation outside of the tumor. [0063] Because the ADs, tumor-specific binding domains, and ICBs of the constructs presented singly (as monomers) do not stimulate cells such as NK cells and CD8+ T effector cells, as effectively as when presented as a pair or multimer by ATP induced dimers (see, e.g., FIGs.1-3 and 4B) or higher order complexes (see, e.g., FIG.4A) described herein, administration of monomeric constructs limits, or substantially limits, systemic immune activation and the associated toxic effects (e.g., the molecules may be systemically safe). The constructs described herein do, however, provide immune stimulation localized to the TME where there is sufficient ATP to drive complex formation, and may thus be considered a form of ATP-dependent agonists of immune cell function whose action is limited to that environment. It is understood that dimers and higher order complexes will have higher avidity for cells in the TME as the energy of binding for two or more binding interactions is greater than the energy of binding from the singular (separate) binding interactions for individual constructs. The difference between the binding energy of the individual constructs and dimers or higher order complexes is reflected in the higher binding avidity (low Kd value) for dimers and higher order complexes than the binding affinity observed for any of the individual constructs that make up the dimers or complexes. In addition, because the complexed forms of the constructs (e.g., dimers, trimers, etc.) have an increase in size and molecular weight, their diffusion from the TME is reduced, restricting their action to the TME. Those dimers or higher order complexes that do diffuse out of the TME will dissociate into individual monomers that are ineffective or less effective at stimulating cellular responses as the ATP levels in the surrounding non-malignant tissue are too low to support their complexation. Accordingly, the immune stimulation provided by the complexes of the constructs described herein is understood to be reversible and restricted to microenvironments where ATP levels are sufficiently high to induce complexation. [0064] The binding interactions between ATP mediated complexes of the constructs described herein may also be described in kinetic terms as opposed to the thermodynamic terms described above. Kinetically, the association rate of individual constructs with cells within a tumor is not understood to be affected by the presence or absence of bound ATP as there is little difference between the size or molecular weight of individual constructs and individual constructs with bound ATP, hence little difference in their diffusion rate and ability to access (enter) the TME. In contrast, once constructs are bound to a c",
    " the complex such as is exemplified in FIG.4A at H, or by combining one or more constructs that comprise an AD, an NBD (e.g., two or more NBDs), and a TSB in the complex such as is exemplified in FIG.4A at I. [00108] Because the TSBs, ICBs, and ADs are provided by different constructs that enter into the complex formed in the TME, the composition of the complex can be controlled by mixing different constructs (e.g., prior to or during administration to a patient). Thus, a single construct may find use in multiple different therapeutic combinations. D. Elements of NBD-containing constructs 1. NBDs and interactions with ATP [00109] NBDs for incorporation into the constructs described herein may be selected based on several criteria. Where the constructs are intended for human therapeutic use, the NBDs are preferentially derived from human ATP binding proteins to limit their immunogenicity and are preferably able to undergo solution phase dimerization or higher complex formation when exposed to sufficient ATP. Where non-human proteins that are immunogenic are employed, the immunogenic portions may be humanized by altering the immunogenic regions to more closely match, or completely match, their human homologs. The solution phase formation of dimers or higher order complexes used in the constructs described herein occurs at ATP concentrations found in the target TME, but not in normal tissues. Accordingly, an NBD for use in the constructs provided herein may have, for example, a dissociation constant for ATP from about an order of magnitude above (10 times above) the upper level found in the extracellular space of normal tissues (i.e., about 1 \u03bcM or higher) up to about the level of ATP found in the TME. In some cases, the affinity of an NBD will be from about 1 \u03bcM to about 200 \u03bcM. For example, the ATP affinity of an NBD may be in a range from about 1 \u03bcM to about 5 \u03bcM or from about 5 \u03bcM to about 25 \u03bcM. The ATP affinity of an NBD may be in a range from about 10 \u03bcM to about 25 \u03bcM or from about 25 \u03bcM to about 200 \u03bcM. The ATP affinity of an NBD may be in a range from about 25 \u03bcM to about 50 \u03bcM. In other examples, the affinity of an NBD may be in a range from about 50 \u03bcM to about 100 \u03bcM or from about 100 \u03bcM to about 200 \u03bcM. An NBD for use in the constructs provided herein may have, for example, a dissociation constant for ATP greater than about 5 \u03bcM or greater than about 10 \u03bcM. \n\n Atty. Docket No.: 2974-6 PCT [00110] NBDs of some proteins form homodimers in the presence of sufficient levels of ATP, while others form heterodimers in the presence of sufficient levels of ATP. Both homodimerizing NBDs and heterodimerizing NBDs may be employed in various aspects of the polypeptide constructs described herein. Where it is desirable to have the NBDs form homodimers in solution when sufficient levels of ATP are present, aa residues at the interface between the dimers may be modified to either remove or substitute aa residues that interfere with interface formation between two NBD molecules. Alternatively, it is possible to substitute aas not contributing to the interactions between the two NBD molecules with aas that will contribute to interactions resulting in homodimer formation. Sequences from TAP1 and TAP2 are known to form heterodimers and may be employed in the constructs described herein for heterodimer formation. Sequences from ABCG5 and ABCG8 are also known to form heterodimers and may be employed in the constructs described herein for heterodimer formation. See, e.g., Alam et al., Annu. Rev. Biophys.2023.52:275\u2013300. a) ATP-binding cassettes as NBDs [00111] A number of proteins comprise NBDs that are suitable for use as NBDs of the constructs described herein. Among those proteins, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters represent suitable candidates in part because ",
    "dentity to SEQ ID NO:290. An NBD aa sequence from human ABCG8 may, for example, comprise an aa sequence having greater than 97% or greater than 98% sequence identity to at least 190 contiguous aas of the NBD aa sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:290. [00175] A hydrolysis deficient ABCG8 NBD corresponding to SEQ ID NO:290 may comprise the sequence: LAIIGSSGCG RASLLDVITG RGHGGKIKSG QIWINGQPSS PQLVRKCVAH VRQHNQLLPN LTVRETLAFI AQMRLPRTFS QAQRDKRVED VIAELRLRQC ADTRVGNMYV RGLSGGERRR VSIGVQLLWN PGILILDXPT SGLDSFTAHN LVKTLSRLAK GNRLVLISLH QPRSDIFRLF DLVLLMTSGT PIYLGAAQHM (SEQ ID NO:298); where X may be any aa other than E, or D, to render the \n\n Atty. Docket No.: 2974-6 PCT sequence ATP hydrolysis deficient and also exclude N to avoid the introduction of an Asn (N) linked glycosylation site. [00176] Alternatively, an ABCG8 NBD aa sequence that may be employed in the constructs of the present disclosure may have at least about 96% or at least about 98% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO:298. An NBD aa sequence from human ABCG8 may, for example, comprise an aa sequence having greater than 97% or greater than 98% sequence identity to at least 190 contiguous aas of the NBD aa sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:298. (5) Substitutions in NBD Sequences And ATP Mediated Dimer Formation [00177] Substitutions that affect the ATP mediated dimerization or higher order complex formation may alter the concentration at which homodimers or heterodimers of polypeptides comprising NBDs form as reflected in the EC50 for dimerization. Substitutions affecting the EC50 for ATP mediated dimerization may be incorporated into the NBD domains described herein. [00178] Substitutions at positions S542 (e.g., S542A); Q586 (e.g., Q586A), C662 (e.g., C662S), D667 (e.g., D667A); and C735 (e.g., C735S) have been shown to alter the EC50 for ATP induced dimerization or higher order complex formation of TAP1 NBD containing constructs. In addition, a disulfide bond formed between cysteines substituted at L493 and E573 (L493C:E573C as in construct 571) also affects the alteration in EC50. See, for reference, SEQ ID NO:8, Example 7 including constructs 571, 647 and 648, and FIG.21. Although the amino acid positions provided are with reference to the TAP1 sequence provided in SEQ ID NO:8, the corresponding positions in other TAP1 sequences (e.g., SEQ ID NOs:9, 12-14, 291, and 292), TAP2 sequences, and other ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters may be obtained by alignment with SEQ ID NO:8 (see, e.g., FIG.6). The corresponding positions in TAP2 are S507, Q551, R626, and D631. There is no aa directly corresponding to C735 of TAP1 in TAP2. The disulfide bonded cysteine substituted aas in TAP1 (L493C:E573C) correspond to T458 and E538 that may be substituted with cysteines and disulfide bonded in TAP2. [00179] Based on the foregoing, the NBDs of TAP1 and/or TAP2 may comprise substitutions at any one or more of the above-mentioned positions resulting in modified EC50 values for ATP mediated dimerization or higher order complex formation in addition to any one or more other substitutions (e.g., substitutions that render the NBDs ATP hydrolysis deficient). The NBDs of other ABC transporters may similarly comprise conservative substitutions or non- conservative substitutions at the corresponding positions in their sequences in addition to any one or more other substitutions. The NBD of TAP1 may comprise a substitution at D667 (e.g., D667A); and the NBDs of TAP2 and other ABC transporters may comprise a substitution (e.g., an alanine) at the corresponding aa position (see, e.g., construct 647). The NBD of TAP1 may comprise a substitution at Q586 (e.g., Q586A); and the NBDs of TAP2 and other ABC transporters may comprise a substitution (e.g., an alanine) at the corresponding aa position (see, e.g., construct 648). The NBD of TAP1 may comprise substitutions at L493C and E573C resulting in disulfide bond formation; and substitutions at S542 (e.g., S542A), C662 (e.g., C662S), and C735 (e.g., C735S); and the NBDs of TAP2 and other ABC transporters may comprise substitutions at the corresponding aa positions (see, e.g., construct 571). [00180] TAP1, TAP2 and other ABC transporters may comprise substitutions that can affect the EC50 for ATP mediated dimerization or higher order complex formation of ABC transporters in the Q loop amino acids. For example, TAP1 may comprise substitutions at Q586 and/or E587 and TAP2 may comprise substitutions at Q551 \n\n Atty. Docket No.: 2974-6 PCT and/or E552. TAP1 and TAP2 NBD aa sequences may comprise nonconservative substitutions of the magnesium binding aa Q586 in TAP1 or Q551 in TAP2, for example with alanine or another non-charged aa (e.g., Gly, Leu, or Ile). Corresponding substitutions may be made in other ABC transporter NBD aa sequences. Any of the substitutions may be conservative or nonconservative and are not exclusive of other substitutions in the NBD aa sequences. [00181] TAP1, TAP2 and other ABC transporters may comprise substitutions that can affect the EC50 for ATP mediated dimerization or higher order complex formation of ABC transporters in the Walker region aas. For example, TAP1 may comprise substitutions of any one or more of N540, G541, S542, G543, K544, S545, and/or T546 and TAP2 may comprise substitutions at any one or more of N505, G506, S507, G508, K509, S510 (Mg), and/or T511. TAP1 and/or TAP2 NBD aa sequences may comprise substitutions of the magnesium binding aas S545 in TAP1 or S510 in TAP2, for example with alanine or another non-charged aa (e.g., Gly, Leu, or Ile). Corresponding substitutions may be made in other ABC transporter NBD aa sequences. Any of the substitutions may be conservative or nonconservative and are not exclusive of other substitutions in the NBD aa sequences. [00182] TAP1, TAP2 and other ABC transporters may comprise substitutions that can affect the EC50 for ATP mediated dimerization or higher order complex formation of ABC transporters outside of the Walker region aas. For example, TAP1 may comprise substitutions of any one or more of Q586 and D668 and TAP2 may comprise substitutions at any one or more of Q551 and E632, each of which interact with water and/or magnesium in the nucleotide binding pocket. TAP1 and/or TAP2 NBD aa sequences may comprise substitutions of those aas, for example with alanine or another non-charged aa (e.g., Gly, Leu, or Ile). Corresponding substitutions may be made in other ABC transporter NBD aa sequences. Any of the substitutions may be conservative or nonconservative and are not exclusive of other substitutions in the NBD aa sequences. [00183] TAP1, TAP2 and other ABC transporters may comprise substitutions of aas binding to the adenine or ribose of ATP that can affect the EC50 for ATP mediated dimerization or higher order complex formation of ABC transporters. For example, TAP1 may comprise substitutions at any one or more of Y412 (binding to adenine) and V520 (binding to ribose) and TAP2 may comprise substitutions at any one or more of Y477 (binding to adenine) and V585 (binding to ribose). TAP1 and/or TAP2 NBD aa sequences may comprise substitutions of those aas, for example with alanine or another non-charged aa (e.g., Gly, Leu, or Ile). Corresponding substitutions may be made in other ABC transporter NBD aa sequences. Any of the substitutions may be conservative or nonconservative and are not exclusive of other substitutions in the NBD aa sequences. 2. Linkers [00184] The constructs of the present disclosure optionally have independently selected linkers located between any two elements. Independently selected linker sequences may also be placed at the end of aa sequences of the constructs of the present disclosure for stability and protection from proteolysis. The linkers can be located between any two of the NBD aa sequence, the scaffold aa sequence, and the AD. Linkers are typically comprised of aa sequences from 4 to 50 aas in length (e.g., from 4 to 25 aas or from 25 to 50 aas) and may be chosen for, among other things, their rigidity. Linkers are each selected independently. [00185] In some instances, linkers are flexible aa sequences that are comprised of glycine, serine, and/or alanine residues. In other instances, linkers are aa s",
    "d (e.g., with an alanine or serine) so that the Ig heavy chain sequence cannot homodimerize or heterodimerize and form interchain disulfide bonds. [00197] A scaffold polypeptide may comprise the wt. Homo sapiens IgG1 Fc polypeptide sequence: 1 DKTHTCPPCP APELLGGPSV FLFPPKPKDT LMISRTPEVT CVVVDVSHED PEVKFNWYVD 61 GVEVHNAKTK PREEQYNSTY RVVSVLTVLH QDWLNGKEYK CKVSNKALPA PIEKTISKAK 121 GQPREPQVYT LPPSREEMTK NQVSLTCLVK GFYPSDIAVE WESNGQPENN YKTTPPVLDS 181 DGSFFLYSKL TVDKSRWQQG NVFSCSVMHE ALHNHYTQKS LSLSPGK (SEQ ID NO:59) (see NCBI GenPept ACCESSION 7LBL_A), which may form homodimers stabilized by interchain disulfide bonds during expression. A scaffold may comprise an aa sequence having greater than about 90% or greater than about 95% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO:59. A scaffold may also comprise an aa sequence having greater than 96% or greater than 98% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO:59. [00198] Ig Fc aa sequences may comprise CH2 and/or CH3 domains modified to prevent dimerization, with the resulting sequences existing in monomeric form. One set of substitutions that may be included in IgG1 heavy chain constant region aa sequences that substantially or completely blocks dimerization with another IgG1 aa sequence includes L351S, T366R, L368H and P395K (corresponding to L131S, T146R, L348H, and P175K in SEQ ID NO:59). See Ying et al. (2014) mAbs 6(5):1201-1210. IgG1 Fc sequences bearing those substitutions remain in soluble monomeric form capable of high affinity binding to Fc\u03b3RI (Kd on the order of 10 nM) and bind to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) that prevents lysosomal degradation of antibodies thereby extending their in vivo half-life. Id. At the same time, monomeric IgG1 sequences bearing those substitutions fail to provide effector functions including Fc- mediated CDC and ADCC by natural killer cells consistent with their failure to bind to the Fc\u03b3RIIIa receptor. Id. [00199] An IgG1 sequence comprising those sequence substitutions suitable as a monomeric (non-dimerizing) Fc sequence (mFc) scaffold in the molecules described herein may comprise the aa sequence \n\n Atty.

A scaffold may also comprise an aa sequence having greater than 96% or greater than 98% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO:60, while retaining the substitutions that cause it to remain monomeric. [00200] Stabilizing disulfide bonds may be introduced into the sequence of SEQ ID NO:60 between cysteines substituted for L242 and K334 (indicated as C* in SEQ ID NO:61 and SEQ ID NO:62), and/or between cysteines",
    "btain selective action by the constructs described herein in target tissue(s) (e.g., in a TME), the constructs should dimerize or form higher order complexes (dimerization/complexation) at ATP concentrations found in those target tissue(s) but not at the ATP concentrations found in non-target tissue. To determine if a patient or subject may benefit from therapy using the constructs described herein, and/or select constructs that will undergo dimerization/complexation at the ATP concentrations in their target tissue(s), the methods and uses of constructs described herein, including methods of capping or lattice formation described below, may include measurement of the ATP concentration in a target tissue, a non-target tissue, or both a target and a non-target tissue. Measurements in the tissues surrounding a target tissue (e.g., peritumor tissue) may also be used in place of, or in addition to, measurements of ATP concentrations in a non-target tissue. Depending on how much ATP mediated `dimerization/complexation in tissues surrounding the target is acceptable and/or desirable, particularly in the therapeutic setting, the measurements in the surrounding non-target tissue may be more or less informative in the selection of constructs that dimerize/complex at suitable ATP concentrations. For example, where potential damage \n\n Atty. Docket No.: 2974-6 PCT to one or more surrounding tissues during therapy is a critical concern, it may be more suitable to select constructs with an EC50 for dimerization/complexation at an ATP concentration slightly above the concentration in the target tissue so that a significant portion of the construct may dimerize/complex in that tissue (even if less than half of the construct(s) in that tissue dimerize) because even less will dimerize/complex in the surrounding tissue(s) where ATP is at a lower concentration. [00344] Increasing the fraction of constructs that are in ATP mediated dimers/complexes increases their localization to target and their residence time in that target tissue particularly where they comprise TSB elements in part because of the increase in the effective binding energy, reflected as increased avidity (affinity) for the corresponding TAA. Increasing the fraction of constructs that are in ATP mediated dimers/complexes is particularly desirable for constructs bearing payloads (e.g., radiolabels, and chemotherapeutics) that do not require external stimulation (radiation or light in the case of photodynamic therapy) to effect treatment. It is also beneficial for payloads that require external stimulation to effect treatment (e.g., photosensitizers or radiosensitizers) that when combined with other treatments can substantially limit damage to non-target tissues, particularly in those instances where the external stimulus can be precisely applied to the target tissue (e.g., light or radiation focused on target issue from one or more external sources). [00345] As discussed above, those ATP measurements may be made to assist in selecting constructs that dimerize at a suitable ATP concentration to produce the therapeutic effect associated with formation of dimers/complexes of the constructs, while limiting side effects due to action on non-target tissues. Measurements of ATP levels in non-target tissues and/or target tissues may be made prior to or during treatment with an NBD- containing construct described herein. ATP concentration measurements in target and non-target tissues may also be made subsequent to any one or more administrations of the construct. The concentration in target tissue such as in a solid tumor\u2019s TME, in the vicinity of non-solid cancers where the cells localize (accumulate in a given location such as an organ or tissue), or in non-target tissue(s) may be made by methods known in the art (see, e.g., Rajendran et al., Biol Bull.2016; 231(1): 73\u201384). Methods for assessing ATP concentration in vivo include but are not limited to: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)/Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS), including phosphorous MRI (see, e.g., Gams et al., Curr. Oncol.2021, 28, 5041\u20135053 and Malik Galija\u0161evi\u0107 et al. Cancers 2021, 13, 3569). Additionally, the use of liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry, microelectrode measurement, and molecular probes (e.g., fluorescent or luminescent probes) may be utilized (e.g., of biopsy samples). [00346] As the typical ATP concentration in non-target tissue is typically 0.01 \u00b5M to 0.1 \u03bcM (100nM) the EC50 ATP induced dimerization/complexation may be selected to be higher than in the non- target tissue ATP concentration range. The concentration in target tissues such as the TME may be from about 50 to about 1,000 \u03bcM or even higher and the EC50 for ATP induced dimerization/complexation may be selected to be below, or at about the lower end of the target tissue concentration range to slightly above the concentration found in a target tissue. Accordingly, some EC50 value ranges for ATP induced dimerization/complexation consistent with target tissue selective use of the constructs or compositions described herein include the following ranges. The construct or composition may have an EC50 for ATP induced dimerization/complexation from about 0.1 \u03bcM to about 0.5 \u03bcM of ATP, or from about 0.5 \u03bcM to about 5.0 \u03bcM of ATP. The construct or composition may also have an EC50 for ATP induced dimerization/complexation from about 5.0 \u03bcM to about 50 \u03bcM of ATP, or from about 50 \u03bcM to about 250 \u03bcM \n\n Atty. Docket No.: 2974-6 PCT of ATP. Additionally, the constructs may also have an EC50 for ATP induced dimerization/complexation from about 250 \u03bcM ATP to about 1 mM ATP or more. Generally, the highest target tissue specific action and lowest off target action may be obtained by selecting constructs having an EC50 from about 0.2 times to about the ATP concentration in the target tissue (e.g., up to about twice the concentration of ATP, in the target tissue), or about 0.4 times to about the ATP concentration in the target tissue, and at least 10 times the ATP concentration in non-target tissues. [00347] Demonstration of ATP-induced dimerization of constructs (or their NBDs) may be carried out by size exclusion chromatography in, for example, a buffer such as 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10% glycerol buffer, optionally with 0.005% Tween (v/v) (using, e.g., a Superdex 20010/300 Increase or 16/600 column (depending on total protein quantities)) at 20 to 24 \u00b0C. The observed retention time of the protein when comparing resulting chromatograms of NBD-containing proteins when run in buffer (as described above) with or without ATP will allow for the determination of monomeric vs dimeric form. [00348] The EC50 value for ATP-induced dimerization of constructs (or their NBDs) may be measured via Biolayer Interferometry (BLI) using an Octet Red 96e instrument (Pall ForteBio LLC, Freemont, CA) by observing the alteration in signal (i.e., the interference pattern of white light reflected from the biological layer constructed on a biosensor tip) in 20mM Tris-HCl, 150mM NaCl, 5mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>.6H2O Hexahydrate, 0.005% Tween (v/v) pH 7.0 at 20 to 24 \u00b0C at different ATP concentrations (e.g., by titration of ATP). For constructs comprising TSBs EC50 is assessed by immobilizing target TAA to the biosensor tip and observing the signal change for a construct associating with the probe due to the increased avidity of the dimeric form at various ATP concentrations. For other constructs, and particularly where heterodimeric construct pairs are formed, some of the construct (e.g., a first member of a heterodimer) may be immobilized on the surface probe (e.g. using a streptavidin coated probe for constructs with an IgFc or an immobilized antibody to a portion of the construct preferably other than the NBD). Additional construct (e.g., the second member of a heterodimer pair) is exposed to the construct immobilized on the surface probe at various ATP concentrations and the response (alteration in the signal) observed. The midpoint of the ATP induced response of the BLI probe represents the EC50. [00349] As an alternative to measuring ATP to determine if a patient or subject may benefit from treatment with the constructs of this disclosure, the concentration or expression level of CD73 may be assessed in the target tissue. The assessment may be made relative to a control non-target tissue or a peritumoral target tissue. An elevated level of CD73 (e.g., relative to a control tissue) indicates that a patient or subject is likely to benefit from treatment using constructs of the present disclosure because CD73 is understood to correlate with elevated extracellular adenosine / ATP levels. Accordingly, any of the methods of treatment or use of the constructs disclosed herein may comprise assessment of CD73 in a target tissue (a tumor TME tissue), a non-target tissue such as peritumor tissue, or both. 3. Methods of Capping or Lattice Formation [00350] Capping (CAP formation), or lattice formation, is the reorganization of molecules on or in a cell\u2019s outer membrane from a distributed state (e.g., globally distributed on a cell\u2019s surface) into one or more aggregated masses on the cell\u2019s surface. The present disclosure includes and provides for methods of inducing capping or lattice formation on the surface of an immune cell (e.g., T cells, macrophages, NK cells, etc.) or a cancer cell.

Docket No.: 2974-6 PCT binding constants across a range of ATP concentrations (0.1 to 100 mM) using Biolayer Interferometry (BLI). More specifically, mesothelin was immobilized onto streptavidin (SAX) biosensors in equilibration buffer 20mM Tris, 150mM NaCl, 5mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>.6H2O Hexahydrate, 0.005% Tween pH 7.0, and the indicated concentrations of ADP or ATP. After washing away excess mesothelin, with equilibration buffer in the absence of ATP or in the presence of ATP at the concentrations from 0.1 \u03bcM to 100 \u03bcM, samples of the constructs (at 5, 10, and 20 nM) were then added and the sample allowed to equilibrate with the biosensor. The dissociation rate constants (kdis) at each concentration were the measured by following the rate of signal decline upon replacing the equilibration buffer containing construct with equilibration buffer containing ATP at the indicated concentration but without any construct present. The residence time, which is the inverse of the dissociation constant (i.e., (1/(kdis)) is plotted.
