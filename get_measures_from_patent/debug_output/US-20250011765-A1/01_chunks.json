    "ented in a pack or dispenser device which may contain one or more unit dosage forms containing the molecule(s). The pack may, for example, comprise metal or plastic foil, such as a blister pack. The pack or dispenser device may be accompanied by instructions for administration.</p>The molecule(s) described herein, or pharmaceutical compositions thereof, will generally be used in an amount effective to achieve the intended result, for example in an amount effective to treat or prevent the particular disease being treated. By therapeutic benefit is meant eradication or amelioration of the underlying disorder being treated and/or eradication or amelioration of one or more of the symptoms associated with the underlying disorder such that the patient reports an improvement in feeling or condition, notwithstanding that the patient may still be afflicted with the underlying disorder. Therapeutic benefit also generally includes halting or slowing the progression of the disease, regardless of whether improvement is realized.</p>Determination of an effective dosage of molecule(s) for a particular use and mode of administration is well within the capabilities of those skilled in the art. Effective dosages may be estimated initially from in vitro activity and metabolism assays. For example, an initial dosage of compound for use in animals may be formulated to achieve a circulating blood or serum concentration of the metabolite active compound (e.g., efRNA product) that is at or above an IC50 of the particular compound as measured in as in vitro assay. Calculating dosages to achieve such circulating blood or serum concentrations taking into account the bioavailability of the particular compound via the desired route of administration is well within the capabilities of skilled artisans. Initial dosages of compound can also be estimated from in vivo data, such as animal models. Animal models useful for testing the efficacy of the active metabolites to treat or prevent the various diseases described above are well-known in the art. Animal models suitable for testing the bioavailability and/or metabolism of compounds into active metabolites are also well-known. Ordinarily skilled artisans can routinely adapt such information to determine dosages of particular compounds suitable for human administration.</p>Dosage amounts will depend upon, among other factors, the activity of the active compound, the bioavailability of the compound, its metabolism kinetics and other pharmacokinetic properties, the mode of administration, and various other factors, discussed above. Dosage amount and interval may be adjusted individually to provide plasma levels of the compound(s) and/or active metabolite compound(s) which are sufficient to maintain therapeutic or prophylactic effect. For example, the compounds may be administered once per week, several times per week (e.g., every other day), once per day or multiple times per day, depending upon, among other things, the mode of adm"
