    "an anti-hTNF\u03b1 antibody, antibody portion, or other TNF\u03b1 inhibitor of the invention may be coformulated and/or coadministered with one or more additional antibodies that bind other targets (e.g., antibodies that bind other cytokines or that bind cell surface molecules), one or more cytokines, soluble TNF\u03b1 receptor (see e. g., PCT Publication No. WO 94/06476) and/or one or more chemical agents that inhibit hTNF\u03b1 production or activity (such as cyclohexane-ylidene derivatives as described in PCT Publication No. WO 93/19751). Furthermore, one or more antibodies or other TNF\u03b1 inhibitors of the invention may be used in combination with two or more of the foregoing therapeutic agents. Such combination therapies may advantageously utilize lower dosages of the administered therapeutic agents, thus avoiding possible toxicities or complications associated with the various monotherapies. Specific therapeutic agent(s) are generally selected based on the particular TNF\u03b1-related disorder being treated, as discussed below.</p>Nonlimiting examples of therapeutic agents with which an antibody, antibody portion, or other TNF\u03b1 inhibitor can be combined in a multiple variable dose method of treatment of the invention include the following: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug(s) (NSAIDs); cytokine suppressive anti-inflammatory drug (s) (CSAIDs); CDP-571/BAY-10-3356 (humanized anti-TNF\u03b1 antibody; Celltech/Bayer); cA2/infliximab (chimeric anti-TNF\u03b1 antibody; Centocor); 75 kdTNFR-IgG/etanercept (75 kD TNF receptor-IgG fusion protein; Immunex; see e.g., Arthritis &amp; Rheumatism (1994) Vol. 37, S295; J.
