    "eptide; a nucleic acid encoding a second GMCSFRss; and a nucleic acid encoding a truncated human epidermal growth factor receptor (huEGFRt). In some examples, the nucleic acid molecule further includes a human elongation factor 1\u03b1 (EF1\u03b1) promoter sequence 5\u2032 of the nucleic acid encoding the first GMCSFRss. Vectors (such as lentiviral vectors) that include the disclosed nucleic acid molecules are further provided.</p>Also provided are isolated immune cells (such as T cells, B cells, NK cells or macrophages) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) expressing a CAR disclosed herein and/or containing an isolated nucleic acid molecule or vector disclosed herein.</p>Further provided are compositions that include a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a CAR, nucleic acid molecule, vector or cell disclosed herein.</p>Methods of treating a GPC3-positive cancer, or inhibiting tumor growth or metastasis of a GPC3-positive cancer, in a subject are also provided. In some aspects, the methods include administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a CAR, nucleic acid molecule, vector, cell or composition disclosed herein. In some examples, the GPC3-positive cancer is a solid tumor, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).</p>The foregoing and other objects and features of the disclosure will become more apparent from the following detailed description, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying figures.</p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSFIGS. 1A-1B: Jurkat binding assay. Jurkat T cells expressing hYP7-CD8H-CD8TM, HN3-CD8H-CD8TM, HN3-IgG4H-CD28TM, HN3-IgG4H-CD8TM or HN3-CD8H-CD28TM CAR were exposed to GPC3-hFc (FIG. 1A) or GPC1-hFc (FIG. 1B). All hYP7 and HN3 CAR-expressing Jurkat cells specifically bound GPC3-hFc.</p>FIGS. 2A-2D: (FIG. 2A) Schematic of CAR T cell constructs. The constructs included either HN3or hYP7 with a CD8 or IgG4 hinge (H), and a CD8 or CD28 transmembrane (TM) domain. (FIG. 2B) Depiction of CAR T cell constructs in a cell membrane. (FIG. 2C) Cell count of CAR-expressing cells monitored over the course of 11 days. (FIG. 2D) Transduction efficiency of CAR constructs as measured by CAR-positive cells at Day 8. These results demonstrate that the engineered CARs can be expressed in donor T cells.</p>FIGS. 2E-2H: Graphs showing cell killing induced by CAR T cells cultured with GPC3-expressing HCC cell lines Hep3B (FIG. 2E), Huh7 (FIG. 2G) and HepG2 (FIG. 2H) or GPC3-negative Hep3B-GPC3-KO-C3 cells (FIG. 2F). Specific lysis was measured at different effector to target ratios. Engineered CAR T cells potently killed Hep3B, Huh7 and HepG2 cells, but not Hep3B GPC3 knockout (KO) cells, demonstrating antigen-specific killing.</p>FIGS. 3A-3D: (FIG. 3A) Schematic of the experimental design of a study using the NOD-SCID-Gamma (NSG) mouse model. Hep3B GFP/luciferase expressing cells (3 million) were injected IP into NSG mice and allowed to engraft for 12 days. Mice were treated with 5 million hYP7-CD8H-CD8TM, hYP7-IgG4H-C"
