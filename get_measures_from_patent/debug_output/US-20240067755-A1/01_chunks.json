Thus, the smaller the equilibrium dissociation constant, the more tightly bound the ligand is, or the higher the affinity between ligand and protein. For example, a ligand with a pico-molar (pM) dissociation constant binds more tightly to a particular protein than a ligand with a nano-molar (nM) dissociation constant. The binding of the antibody of the invention and the hapten, i.e. fentanyl or a derivative thereof, shall be with an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of at most 1.000 pM, at most 800 pM, at most 600 pM, at most 400 pM, at most 200 pM, at most 100 pM or at most 75 pM.
