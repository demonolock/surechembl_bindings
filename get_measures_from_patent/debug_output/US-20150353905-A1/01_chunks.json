It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting, since the scope of the present disclosure will be limited only by the appended claims.</p>Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure belongs. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can also be used in the practice or testing of the present disclosure, the preferred methods and materials are now described.</p>All publications and patents cited in this specification are herein incorporated by reference as if each individual publication or patent were specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference and are incorporated herein by reference to disclose and describe the methods and/or materials in connection with which the publications are cited. The citation of any publication is for its disclosure prior to the filing date and should not be construed as an admission that the present disclosure is not entitled to antedate such publicat",
    "lculated using the number of identical positions divided by the greater of the shortest sequence or the number of equivalent positions excluding overhangs wherein internal gaps are counted as an equivalent position. For example the polypeptides GGGGGG and GGGGT have a sequence identity of 4 out of 5 or 80%. For example, the polypeptides GGGPPP and GGGAPPP have a sequence identity of 6 out of 7 or 85%.</p>In certain embodiments, for any contemplated percentage sequence identity, it is also contemplated that the sequence may have the same percentage of sequence similarity. Percent \u201csimilarity\u201d is used to quantify the extent of similarity, e.g., hydrophobicity, hydrogen bonding potential, electrostatic charge, of amino acids between two sequences of the alignment. This method is similar to determining the identity except that certain amino acids do not have to be identical to have a match. In certain embodiments, sequence similarity may be calculated with well-known computer programs using default parameters. Typically, amino acids are classified as matches if they are among a group with similar properties, e.g., according to the following amino acid groups: Aromatic\u2014F Y W; hydrophobic\u2014A V I L; Charged positive: R K H; Charged negative\u2014D E; Polar\u2014S T N Q.</p>A partially complementary sequence is one that at least partially inhibits (or competes with) a completely complementary sequence from hybridizing to a target nucleic acid\u2014also referred to as \u201csubstantially homologous.\u201d The inhibition of hybridization of the completely complementary sequence to the target sequence may be examined using a hybridization assay (Southern or Northern blot, solution hybridization and the like) under conditions of low stringency. A substantially homologous sequence or probe will compete for and inhibit the binding (i.e., the hybridization) of a sequence which is completely homologous to a target under conditions of low stringency. This is not to say that conditions of low stringency are such that non-specific binding is permitted; low stringency conditions require that the binding of two sequences to one another be a specific (i.e., selective) interaction. The absence of non-specific binding may be tested by the use of a second target which lacks even a partial degree of complementarity (e.g., less than about 30% identity); in the absence of non-specific binding the probe will not hybridize to the second non-complementary target.</p>The following terms are used to describe the sequence relationships between two or more polynucleotides: \u201creference sequence\u201d, \u201csequence identity\u201d, \u201cpercentage of sequence identity\u201d, and \u201csubstantial identity\u201d. A \u201creference sequence\u201d is a defined sequence used as a basis for a sequence comparison; a reference sequence may be a subset of a larger sequence, for example, as a segment of a full-length cDNA sequence given in a sequence listing or may comprise a complete gene sequence. Generally, a reference sequence is at least 20 nucleotides in",
    "teria that are known to encode Cas9 are pathogens or commensals indicating that the CRISPR-CAS component-mediated regulatory mechanism may function in other organisms that interact with eukaryotic cells.</p>Cas9 and Targeting Nucleic Acid Complexes for Use to Alter Gene Expression in Various Biological SystemsIn certain embodiments, the disclosure relates to compositions and methods that use Cas9 systems disclosed herein, e.g., Cas9, tracrRNA, and scaRNA, to target RNAs of interest in the context of various biological systems. This allows the Cas9 system to function as a form of RNA interference. Cas9 is capable of functioning in the eukaryotic cytosol. By using longer targeting RNAs one can increase specificity. In certain embodiments, the disclosure contemplates a segment of a targeting RNA of greater than 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100 nucleotides. Cas9 systems disclosed herein leads to lower levels of protein from an RNA that is targeted. With regard to the claimed embodiments, it is not intended that reduction of protein result by any particular mechanism. It is believed that in some cases the RNA is likely degraded, but it is also possible that Cas9 simply sits on the target RNA blocking access by the ribosome, thereby blocking translation or by some other unappreciated mechanism.</p>It is believed that Cas9 does not rely on any canonical RNAi host factors, such as Dicer or the components of the RISC complex, allowing use in systems which may have intrinsic inhibition of RNAi. Therefore, engineering of Cas9 as programmable RNA-directed RNA targeting systems is beneficial in numerous biological systems. While in some instances Cas9 is directed to its binding site by a \u201cguide RNA\u201d (gRNA or targeting RNA, or RNA-targeting guide RNA or rgRNA) that hybridizes to a target sequence, it is contemplated that the guide may contain a certain number of mismatches or secondary structures. In certain embodiments, the rgRNA is a fusion of the tracrRNA and scaRNAs or variant sequences thereof. In order to combat non-target interactions, certain strategies maybe used, e.g., creating rgRNA secondary structures that inhibit non-target interactions or altering the length of the rgRNA.</p>Cas9 in mammalian cells targeted to recognize viral RNAs prevents productive viral replication. Cas9 can be targeted to any RNA by changing the sequence of the RNA-targeting guide RNA as an anti-viral strategy capable of combating any virus. Cas9 system offer superiority with regard to conventional RNAi for treating or preventing viral infections. Viruses can mutate to evade conventional RNAi systems. The host RNAi machinery relies on sequences of 19-21 bp to interact with the targets to be degraded. In some cases even single base pair mutations in the target can completely abrogate degradation by the host RNAi machinery. RNAi with Cas9 RNA-targeting guide RNA does not rely on endogenous RNA silencing machinery of the host, i.e., self-sufficient.</p>Viruses can directly suppress the RNAi machinery, but are not believed to suppress Cas9 activity because Cas9 is derived from bacteria, i.e., because viral pathogens have not evolved with Cas9, viruses likely cannot escape this system. In certain embodiments, it is contemplated that multiple rgRNAs targeting different regions of viral RNA, e.g., HCV RNA, simultaneously (multiplexing), can be utilized limiting the chances that viral mutations would facilitate escape from this targeting system.</p>Suitable methods for transformation of host cells for use with the disclosure are believed to include virtually any method by which nucleic acids, e.g., DNA can be introduced into a cell, such as by transformation of protoplasts (U.S. Pat. No. 5,508,184), by desiccation/inhibition-mediated DNA uptake, by electroporation, by agitation with silicon carbide fibers U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,302,523; and 5,464,765), by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,563,055; 5,591,616; 5,693,512; 5,824,877; 5,981,840; 6,384,301) and by acceleration of DNA coated particles (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,015,580; 5,550,318; 5,538,880; 6,160,208; 6,399,861; 6,403,865), etc. Through the application of techniques such as these, the cells of virtually any species may be stably transformed. In the case of multicellular species, the transgenic cells may be regenerated into transgenic plants and organisms.</p>Plants and animals genetically engineered to express Cas9 with RNA targeting (rgRNA) or multiple RNA-targeting RNAs specific for different viruses or pests can used to create pest-resistant progeny. In certain embodiments, the disclosure relates to generating transgenic insect vectors that are resistant to viral infection.</p>In certain embodiments, the disclosure contemplates the expression of Cas9 and a gRNA in eukaryotic cells used to target viruses, e.g., Hepatitis C (HCV) RNA, and prevent viral replication. Targeting Cas9 to the eukaryotic cell cytosol was done in order to target HCV RNA (HCV is an RNA virus, and has no DNA stage). Cas9 engineering studies in mammalian cells typically include NLS (nuclear localization signal) to the protein and targeted it to the nucleus in order to target DNA. In certain embodiments, a recombinantly produce Cas9 of this disc",
