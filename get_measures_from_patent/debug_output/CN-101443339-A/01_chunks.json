    "s effect can be used for treating people's tumour and other hyperproliferation disease.It is that target has significant advantage with respect to the signal path (for example those paths that are activated by growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase such as EGF-R ELISA (EGFR) or other acceptor) with the cell cycle upstream that aurora kinase is suppressed as these treatment of diseases means.Because the final downstream of the signal event that the cell cycle, to be all these different, aurora kinase is predicted all to have activity in all proliferative tumour cells such as suppressing at the therapy of cell cycle, and only has activity in the tumour cell subclass of expressing these acceptors at the method for specific signals molecule (for example EGFR) is predicted.Also it is believed that between these signal paths to have significant \" cross talk \", mean that a kind of component is suppressed to be compensated by other.</p>Described the inhibitor of aurora kinase in International Patent Application WO 03/55491 and WO 2004/058781, and disclose the compound with following structural formula (IA) especially in WO 2004/058781, it is known as AZD1152 in this article:</p></p>AZD1152 is a prodrug, and its (in human plasma) promptly and fully is converted into the active part with following structural formula (IVA), and this active part is known as AZD1152HQPA in this article:</p></p>AZD1152 HQPA is the ATP-competitiveness and the reversible inhibitor of aurora kinase, and (the Ki value is respectively 1369 \u00b1 419.2nM, 0.359 \u00b1 0.386nM and 17.03 \u00b1 12.2nM) to have the strong activity of resisting aurora A, B-INCENP and C-INCENP.Have been found that AZD1152 suppresses tumor growth with statistical significance in people's colorectum (SW620, HCT116, Colo205) and lung (A549, Calu-6) tumour xenotransplantation inventory.</p>WO 2004/058781 discloses and has been used to prepare the general technology route that has the compound of similar type with AZD1152.WO 2004/058781 also discloses the operational path that is used to prepare AZD1152.The summary of this operational path is shown in scheme 1.</p>The present invention relates to be used to prepare improving one's methods of AZD1152 and analogue compounds.Especially, the present invention relates to be used for preparing improving one's methods of AZD1152 from AZD1152 HQPA.This method is because it is relevant especially with AZD1152, so its summary is shown in scheme 2.This method is different from previous openly method part and is the new intermediate that it has comprised formula (IIA):</p>Formula (IIA)\n        </p>The inventor finds that this intermediate can be easily separated, and easier to be more separated than the intermediate of previous disclosed formula (IIIA) surprisingly:</p></p>Formula (IIIA)</p>Therefore, method of the present invention allows the compound with yield preparation such as the AZD1152 of still less impurity and raising.</p>Therefore, the invention provides the method for the"
