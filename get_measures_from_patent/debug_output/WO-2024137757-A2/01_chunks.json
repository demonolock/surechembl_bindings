The syringe pump was turned back on at 0.5 mL/min. </p>[0118] The nozzle was turned off after the syringe has been dispensed. </p>[0119] The spheres were incubated in solution for 10 minutes. </p>[0120] The spheres were dispensed into three 50 mL centrifuge tubes and the total volume of Alginate-Calcium Chloride Solution was 138 mL. </p>[0121] Thee tubes were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 4000 RPM. </p>[0122] The supernatant was replaced with equivalent amounts of DPBS and resuspended. </p>[0123] The tubes were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 4000 RPM. </p>[0124] The supernatant was removed and replaced with 10 mL of DPBS per tube. </p>[0125] The tubes were resuspended and the contents of the tubes transferred into a single tube. The total volume of BAM was 37 mL. </p>[0126] The tube was labeled with the lab notebook number, description, and current date and stored at 2-8 \u00b0C. </p>Example 5 </p>[0127] The Mastersizer is a laser diffraction particle size analyzer. It can measure particle sizes 0.1 pm - 3 mm. Measurements of particle size were made using the Mastersizer.
