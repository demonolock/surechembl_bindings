For example, scheme 3 illustrates how a N'- hydroxybenzimidamide can be coupled to the carboxylic and then cyclized to yield the 1, 2, 4 - oxadiazole derivative of structural formula J. The cyclization reaction can be performed under many mild conditions including, for example, HCl or heat and in some instances might occur during the coupling reaction between the hydrazide and the acid.</p>Scheme 3</p><img id=\"imgf000061_0002\" path=\"imgf000061_0002.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/89971733/WO/20090827/A2/002009/10/52/14/imgf000061_0002.tif\"/>\n Other heteroaryl rings in place of variable A may also be prepared. For example, a 1 ,3 oxazole derivative maybe prepared by the method illustrated in scheme 4 shown below.</p>Scheme 4</p>1 - Couple 2<sup> \u25a0</sup> Dehydrate \n<img id=\"imgf000062_0002\" path=\"imgf000062_0002.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/89971983/WO/20090827/A2/002009/10/52/14/imgf000062_0002.tif\"/>\n \n<img id=\"imgf000062_0001\" path=\"imgf000062_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/89971757/WO/20090827/A2/002009/10/52/14/imgf000062_0001.tif\"/>\n</p>DETERMINATION OF BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY</p>In order to demonstrate the utility of the compounds of this invention, an androgen receptor binding assay was performed wherein many of the compounds of this invention are shown to demonstrate significant affinity for the androgen receptor. The assay was performed as specified by the manufacturer (Invitrogen, Madison, WI). Briefly, l \u03bcl of 1OmM compound was added to 500\u03bcl of AR screening buffer in a 1.5ml eppendorf tube to make a 2x10<sup>\"5</sup>M stock. 10-fold serial dilutions of the test compounds were prepared ranging in concentration from 10<sup>\"5</sup>M to 10<sup>\"12</sup>M. Each dilution was added in triplicate to a black 384-microtiter plate. The test compounds will be diluted 2-fold in the final reaction. 2x AR-Fluormone\u2122 complex was prepared with 2nM Flourmone AL Green\u2122 and 3OnM AR. 25\u03bcl of 2x complex was aliquoted to each reaction well, such that the final reaction volume was 50\u03bcl per well. Plate was sealed with a foil cover and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 4 h. Polarization values for each well were measured. The polarization values were plotted against the concentration of the test compound. The concentration of the test compound that results in half-maximum shift equals the IC<sub>5</sub>Q of the test compound. As a control, a competition curve for \n\n Rl 881 (methyltrienolone) was performed for each assay. Curve Fitting was performed using GraphPad Prism\u00ae software from GraphPad\u2122 Software Inc. Binding data are reported as a single determination if the experiment was run once only and as the average of experiments if the binding experi"
