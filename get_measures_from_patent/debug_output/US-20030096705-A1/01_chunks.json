    "nes: Structure and Function [0003] The migration of leukocytes from blood vessels into diseased tissues is an important process in the initiation of normal inflammatory responses to certain stimuli or insults to the immune system. However, this process is also involved in the onset and progression of life-threatening inflammatory and autoimmune diseases; blocking leukocyte recruitment in these disease states, therefore, can be an effective therapeutic strategy. </p>[0004] The mechanism by which leukocytes leave the bloodstream and accumulate at inflammatory sites involves three distinct steps: (1) rolling, (2) arrest and firm adhesion, and (3) transendothelial migration [Springer, Nature 346:425-433 (1990); Lawrence and Springer, Cell 65:859-873 (1991); Butcher, Cell 67:1033-1036 (1991)]. The second step is mediated at the molecular level by chemoattractant receptors on the surface of leukocytes which bind chemoattractant cytokines secreted by proinflammatory cells at the site of damage or infection. Receptor binding activates leukocytes, increases their adhesiveness to the endothelium, and promotes their transmigration into the affected tissue, where they can secrete inflammatory and chemoattractant cytokines and degradative proteases that act on the subendothelial matrix, facilitating the migration of additional leukocytes to the site of injury. </p>[0005] The chemoattractant cytokines, collectively known as \u201cchemokines,\u201d are a large family of low molecular weight (8 to 10 kD) proteins that share the ability to stimulate directed cell migration (\u201cchemotaxis\u201d) [Schall, Cytokine 3:165-183 (1991); Murphy, Rev Immun 12:593-633 (1994)]. </p>[0006] Chemokines are characterized by the presence of four conserved cysteine residues and are grouped into two main subfamilies based on whether the two amino-terminal cysteines are separated by one amino acid (CXC subfamily, also known as \u03b1-chemokines) or immediately adjacent to each other (CC subfamily, also referred to as \u03b2-chemokines) [Baggiolini et al., Adv Immunol 55:97-179 (1994); Baggiolini et al., Annu Rev Immunol 15:675-705 (1997); Deng et al., Nature 381:661-666 (1996); Luster, New Engl J Med 338:436445 (1998); Saunders and Tarby, Drug Discovery Today 4:80-92 (1999)]. </p>[0007] The chemokines of the CXC subfamily, represented by IL-8, are produced by a wide range of cells and act predominantly on neutrophils as mediators of acute inflammation. The CC chemokines, which include MCP-1, RANTES, MIP-1\u03b1, and MIP-1\u03b2, are also produced by a variety of cells, but these molecules act mainly on monocytes and lymphocytes in chronic inflammation. </p>[0008] Like many cytokines and growth factors, chemokines utilize both high and low affinity interactions to elicit full biological activity. Studies performed with labeled ligands have identified chemokine binding sites (\u201creceptors\u201d) on the surface of neutrophils, monocytes, T cells, and eosinophils with affinities in the 500 pM to 10 nM range [Kelvin et al., J Leu",
    "ng of these receptors has revealed that cell surface high-affinity chemokine receptors belong to the seven transmembrane (\u201cserpentine\u201d) G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. </p>[0009] Chemokine receptors are expressed on different cell types, including non-leukocyte cells. Some receptors are restricted to certain cells (e.g., the CXCR1 receptor is predominantly restricted to neutrophils), whereas others are more widely expressed (e.g., the CCR2 receptor is expressed on monocytes, T cells, natural killer cells, dendritic cells, and basophils). </p>[0010] Given that at least twice as many chemokines have been reported to date as there are receptors, there is a high degree of redundancy in the ligands and, not surprisingly, most chemokine receptors are rather promiscuous with regard to their binding partners. For example, both MIP-1a and RANTES bind to the CCR1 and CCR4 receptors, while MCP-1 binds to the CCR2 and CCR4 receptors. Although most chemokines receptors bind more than one chemokine, CC receptors bind only CC chemokines, and CXC receptors bind only CXC chemokines. This ligand-receptor restriction may be related to the structural differences between CC and CXC chemokines, which have similar primary, secondary, and tertiary structures, but different quaternary structures [Lodi et al., Science 263:1762-1767 (1994)]. </p>[0011] The binding of chemokines to their serpentine receptors is transduced into a variety of biochemical and physiological changes, including inhibition of cAMP synthesis, stimulation of cytosolic calcium influx, upregulation or activation of adhesion proteins, receptor desensitization and internalization, and cytoskeletal rearrangements leading to chemotaxis [Vaddi et al., J Immunol 153:4721-4732 (1994); Szabo et al., Eur J Immunol 27:1061-1068 (1997); Campbell et al., Science 279:381-384 (1998); Aragay et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 95:2985-2990 (1998); Franci et al., J Immunol 157:5606-5612 (1996); Aramori et al., EMBO J 16:4606-4616 (1997); Haribabu et al., J Biol Chem 272:28726-28731 (1997); Newton et al., Methods Enzymol 287:174-186 (1997)]. In the case of macrophages and neutrophils, chemokine binding also triggers cellular activation, resulting in lysozomal enzyme release and generation of toxic products from the respiratory burst [Newton et al., Methods Enzymol 287:174-186 (1997); Zachariae et al., J Exp Med 171:2177-2182 (1990); Vaddi et al., J Leukocyte Biol 55:756-762 (1994)]. The molecular details of the chemokine-receptor interactions responsible for inducing signal transduction, as well as the specific pathways that link binding to the above-mentioned physiological changes, are still being elucidated. Notwithstanding the complexity of these events, it has been shown that in the case of the MCP-1/CCR2 interaction, specific molecular features of MCP-1 can induce different conformations in CCR2 that are coupled to separate post-receptor pathways [Jarnagin et al., Biochemistry 38:16167-16177 (1999)].

Blood was collected in the presence of heparin, and the hearts were perfused in situ with PBS (pH 7.4), followed by 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min. </p>[0312] To determine cross-sectional lesion areas, the hearts were embedded in OCT compound and sectioned at 10 pm using cryostat.

Five sections were examined for each animal, and the sum of the lesion areas was calculated and expressed as the percent of the total cross-sectional wall area.

Compounds were prepared as 10 mM stock solution in DMSO. THP-1 cells were washed with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 0.5% BSA and 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, and suspended at a density of 4\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>cells/mL in the same medium. A 150 \u03bcL aliquot of this suspension was treated with an equal volume of test compound solution and the mixture incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 15 min. The lower chamber was loaded with 26 \u03bcL of a 2.5 nM solution of hMCP-1 (PeproTech) in medium. The filter membrane was placed over the lower chamber, followed by a silicon rubber gasket and the upper chamber. A 50 \u03bcL aliquot of the THP-1 cell suspension containing the test compound was added to the upper chamber and the assembly incubated in a 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere at 37+ C. for 2 hr. The chamber was then disassembled and the cells remaining on the upper surface of the filter were scrapped off with a rubber scrapper. The filter was fixed with methanol, stained with Diff-Quik solution, and mounted on a slide glass. The cells that had migrated across the filter onto the lower surface were then counted by microscopic observation.
