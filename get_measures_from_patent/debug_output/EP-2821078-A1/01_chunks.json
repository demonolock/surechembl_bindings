    "genesis, and precancerous conditions such as dysplasia.</p>\"Inhibitors\" and \"antagonists\" or \"activators\" and \"agonists\" refer to inhibitory or activating molecules, respectively, e.g., for the activation of, e.g., a ligand, receptor, cofactor, gene, cell, tissue, or organ. A modulator of, e.g., a gene, a receptor, a ligand, or a cell, is a molecule that alters an activity of the gene, receptor, ligand, or cell, where activity can be activated, inhibited, or altered in its regulatory properties. The modulator may act alone, or it may use a cofactor, e.g., a protein, metal ion, or small molecule. Inhibitors are compounds that decrease, block, prevent, delay activation, inactivate, desensitize, or down regulate, e.g., a gene, protein, ligand, receptor, or cell. Activators are compounds that increase, activate, facilitate, enhance activation, sensitize, or up regulate, e.g., a gene, protein, ligand, receptor, or cell. An inhibitor may also be defined as a composition that reduces, blocks, or inactivates a constitutive activity. An \"agonist\" is a compound that interacts with a target to cause or promote an increase in the activation of the target. An \"antagonist\" is a compound that opposes the actions of an agonist. An antagonist prevents, reduces, inhibits, or neutralizes the activity of an agonist. An antagonist can also prevent, inhibit, or reduce constitutive activity of a target, e.g., a target receptor, even where there is no identified agonist.</p>To examine the extent of inhibition, for example, samples or assays comprising a given, e.g., protein, gene, cell, or organism, are treated with a potential activator or inhibitor and are compared to control samples without the inhibitor. Control samples, i.e., not treated with antagonist, are assigned a relative activity value of 100%. Inhibition is achieved when the activity value relative to the control is about 90% or less, typically 85% or less, more typically 80% or less, most typically 75% or less, generally 70% or less, more generally 65% or less, most generally 60% or less, typically 55% or less, usually 50% or less, more usually 45% or less, most usually 40% or less, preferably 35% or less, more preferably 30% or less, still more preferably 25% or less, and most preferably less than 25%. Activation is achieved when the activity value relative to the control is about 110%, generally at least 120%, more generally at least 140%, more generally at least 160%, often at least 180%, more often at least 2-fold, most often at least 2.5-fold, usually at least 5-fold, more usually at least 10-fold, preferably at least 20-fold, more preferably at least 40-fold, and most preferably over 40-fold higher.</p>Endpoints in activation or inhibition can be monitored as follows. Activation, inhibition, and response to treatment, e.g., of a cell, physiological fluid, tissue, organ, and animal or human subject, can be monitored by an endpoint. The endpoint may comprise a predetermined quantity or percentage of, e.g., an indicia of inflammation, oncogenicity, or cell degranulation or secretion, such as the release of a cytokine, toxic oxygen, or a protease. The endpoint may comprise, e.g., a predetermined quantity of ion flux or transport; cell migration; cell adhesion; cell proliferation; potential for metastasis; cell differentiation; and change in phenotype, e.g., change in expression of gene relating to inflammation, apoptosis, transformation, cell cycle, or metastasis (see, e.g., Knight (2000) Ann. Clin. Lab. Sci. 30:145-158; Hood and Cheresh (2002) Nature Rev. Cancer 2:91-100; Timme, et al. (2003) Curr. Drug Targets 4:251-261; Robbins and Itzkowitz (2002) Med. Clin. North Am. 86:1467-1495; Grady and Markowitz (2002) Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 3:101-128; Bauer, et al. (2001) Glia 36:235-243; Stanimirovic and Satoh (2000) Brain Pathol 10:113-126).</p>An endpoint of inhibition is generally 75% of the control or less, preferably 50% of the control or less, more preferably 25% of the control or less, and most preferably 10% of the control or less. Generally, an endpoint of activation is at least 150% the control, preferably at least two times the control, more preferably at least four times the control, and most preferably at least 10 times the control.</p>A composition that is \"labeled\" is detectable, either directly or indirectly, by spectroscopic, photochemical, biochemical, immunochemical, isotopic, or chemical methods. For example, useful labels include <sup>32</sup>P, <sup>33</sup>P, <sup>35</sup>S, <sup>14</sup>C, <sup>3</sup>H, <sup>125</sup>I, stable isotopes, fluorescent dyes, electron-dense reagents, substrates, epitope tags, or enzymes, e.g., as used in enzyme-linked immunoassays, or fluorettes (see, e.g., Rozinov and Nolan (1998) Chem. Biol. 5:713-728).</p>\"Ligand\" refers, e.g., to a small molecule, peptide, polypeptide, and membrane associated or membrane-bound molecule, or complex thereof, that can act as an agonist or antagonist of a receptor. \"Ligand\" also encompasses an agent that is not an agonist or antagonist, but that can bind to the receptor without significantly influencing its biological properties, e.g., signaling or adhesion. Moreover, \"ligand\" includes a membrane-bound ligand that has been changed, e.g., by chemical or recombinant methods, to a soluble version of the membrane-bound ligand. By convention, where a ligand is membrane-bound on a first cell, the receptor usually occurs on a second cell. The second cell may have the same or a different identity as the first cell. A ligand or receptor may be entirely intracellular, that is, it may reside in the cytosol, nucleus, or some other intracellular compartment. The ligand or receptor may change its location, e.g., from an intracellular compartment to the outer face of the plasma membrane. The complex of a ligand and receptor is termed a \"ligand receptor complex.\" Where a ligand and receptor are involved in a signaling pathway, the ligand occurs at an upstream position and the receptor occurs at a downstream position of the signaling pathway.</p>\"Small molecules\" are provided for the treatment of physiology and disorders of tumors and cancers. \"Small molecule\" is defined as a molecule with a molecular weight that is less than 10 kD, typically less than 2 kD, and preferably less than 1 kD. Small molecules include, but are not limited to, inorganic molecules, organic molecules, organic molecules containing an inorganic component, molecules comprising a radioactive atom, synthetic molecules, peptide mimetics, and antibody mimetics. As a therapeutic, a small molecule may be more permeable to cells, less susceptible to degradation, and less apt to elicit an immune response than large molecules. Small molecules, such as peptide mimetics of antibodies and cytokines, as well as small molecule toxins are described (see, e.g., Casset, et al. (2003) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 307:198-205; Muyldermans (2001) J. Biotechnol. 74:277-302; Li (2000) Nat. Biotechnol. 18:1251-1256; Apostalopoulos, et al. (2002) Curr. Med. Chem. 9:411-420; Monfardini, et al. (2002) Curr. Pharm. Des. 8:2185-2199; Domingues, et al. (1999) Nat. Struct. Biol. 6:652-656; Sato and Sone (2003) Biochem. J. 371:603-608; U.S. Patent No. 6,326,482 issued to Stewart, et al</patcit>.).</p>A \"chemotherapeutic agent\" is a chemical compound useful in the treatment of cancer. Examples of chemotherapeutic agents include alkylating agents such as thiotepa and cyclosphosphamide (CYTOXAN\u2122); alkyl sulfonates such as busulfan, improsulfan and piposulfan; aziridines such as benzodopa, carboquone, meturedopa, and uredopa; ethylenimines and methylamelamines including altretamine, triethylenemelamine, trietylenephosphoramide, triethylenethiophosphaoramide and trimethylolomelamime nitrogen mustards such as chiorambu",
    "ypical veterinary, experimental, or research subjects include monkeys, dogs, cats, rats, mice, rabbits, guinea pigs, horses, and humans.</p>Determination of the appropriate dose is made by the clinician, e.g., using parameters or factors known or suspected in the art to affect treatment or predicted to affect treatment. Generally, the dose begins with an amount somewhat less than the optimum dose and it is increased by small increments thereafter until the desired or optimum effect is achieved relative to any negative side effects. Important diagnostic measures include those of symptoms of, e.g., the inflammation or level of inflammatory cytokines produced. Preferably, a biologic that will be used is derived from the same species as the animal targeted for treatment, thereby minimizing a humoral response to the reagent. Methods for co-administration or treatment with a second therapeutic agent, e.g., a cytokine, steroid, chemotherapeutic agent, antibiotic, or radiation, are well known in the art (see, e.g., Hardman, et al. (eds.) (2001) Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 10th ed., McGraw-Hill, New York, NY; Poole and Peterson (eds.) (2001) Pharmacotherapeutics for Advanced Practice:A Practical Approach, Lippincott, Williams &amp; Wilkins, Phila., PA; Chabner and Longo (eds.) (2001) Cancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy, Lippincott, Williams &amp; Wilkins, Phila., PA). An effective amount of therapeutic will decrease the symptoms, e.g., tumor size or inhibition of tumor growth, typically by at least 10%; usually by at least 20%; preferably at least about 30%; more preferably at least 40%, and most preferably by at least 50%.</p>VI. Uses.The present invention provides methods of treating a proliferative condition or disorder, e.g., cancer of the uterus, cervix, breast, prostate, testes, penis, gastrointestinal tract, e.g., esophagus, oropharynx, stomach, small or large intestines, colon, or rectum, kidney, renal cell, bladder, bone, bone marrow, skin, head or neck, skin, liver, gall bladder, heart, lung, pancreas, salivary gland, adrenal gland, thyroid, brain, e.g. gliomas, ganglia, central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS), and immune system, e.g., spleen or thymus. The present invention provides methods of treating, e.g., immunogenic tumors, non-immunogenic tumors, dormant tumors, virus-induced cancers, e.g., epithelial cell cancers, endothelial cell cancers, squamous cell carcinomas, papillomavirus, adenocarcinomas, lymphomas, carcinomas, melanomas, leukemias, myelomas, sarcomas, teratocarcinomas, chemically-induced cancers, metastasis, and angiogenesis. The invention also contemplates reducing tolerance to a tumor cell or cancer cell antigen, e.g., by modulating activity of a regulatory T cell (Treg) and or a CD8 T cell (see, e.g., Ramirez-Montagut, et al. (2003) Oncogene 22:3180-3187; Sawaya, et al. (2003) New Engl. J Med. 349:1501-1509; Farrar, et al. (1999) J Immuno/. 162:2842-2849; Le, et al.",
    "d lymphatic organs were harvested at various endpoints to measure mRNA expression for a number of inflammatory markers and to perform immunohistochemistry for several inflammatory cell marker. The tissues were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00b0C. Primary tumor growth was typically monitored twice weekly using electronic calipers. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula (width<sup>2</sup> x length/2) where length is the longer dimension. Tumors were allowed to reach a size of 90-250mm<sup>3</sup> before treatment was started.</p>V. Adminstration of IL-10 and/or PEG-IL-10mIL-10 or PEG-mIL-10 was administered to the immunocompetent mice, while PEG-hIL-10 treatment was used in the B-cell deficient mice. mIL-10, PEG-mIL-10, PEG-hIL-10, or vehicle control was administered subcutaneously at a site distant from the tumor implant. PEG-mIL-10 used in these studies was prepared with the SC-PEG-12K linker. The biological activities of mIL-10 and PEG-m IL-10 were assessed by the application of a short-term proliferation bioassay that utilized MC/9, a mouse mast cell line, which expresses endogenous mIL-10 receptors (R1 and R2). The MC/9 cells proliferate in response to co-stimulation with mIL-4 and mIL-10 (MC/9's do not proliferate with only mIL-4 or mIL-10). Proliferation was measured by colorimetric means using Alamar Blue, a growth indicator dye based on detection of metabolic activity. The biological activity of recombinant or pegylated mIL-30 was assessed by the EC50 value, or the concentration of protein at which half-maximal stimulation is observed in a dose-response curve (Table 1).\nTable 1: MC/9 Proliferation bioassay for the assessment of bioactivity of mIL-10 and PEG-mIL10 reagents used in these studiesProteinEC50 (ng/mL) in MC/9 AssaymIL-100.5711PEG-mIL-104.039</p>Based on the MC/9 bioassay, the specific activity of the pegylated mIL-10 used in the experiments is approximately 7 fold lower than the activity of the mIL-10 used (Table 1).</p>PEG-mIL-10 was administered every second day to mice harboring Ep2 breast cancer tumors.
