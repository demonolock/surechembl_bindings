    "gion merely requires at least 30% (preferably at least 50%, and more preferably at least 80%) similarity in the sequence.</p>The above-mentioned substitution to an analogous amino acid means amino acid substitution in a group where the natural amino acids are classified into the following eight groups.\n(1) Monoaminomonocarboxylic acid\nGly, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile(2) Oxyamino acid\nSer, Thr(3) Sulfur-containing amino acid\nCys, Met(4) Monoaminodicarboxylic acid\nAsp, Glu(5) Diaminomonocarboxylic acid\nLys, Arg(6) Aromatic amino acid\nPhe, Tyr(7) Heterocyclic amino acid\nHis, Trp, Pro(8) Amide amino acid\nAsn, Gln</p>For purposes of determining similarity, truncation or internal deletions of the reference sequence should be disregarded. Sequences having lesser degrees of similarity, comparable biological activity, and equivalent expression characteristics are considered to be essential equivalents.</p>The term \"biologically active\" used as a characteristic of a receptor for modified low-density lipoprotein means either that a particular molecule has sufficient amino acid sequence similarity with the embodiments of the present invention having an activity of binding modified low-density lipoprotein, or that a particular molecule has sufficient amino acid sequences similarity to the receptor for modified low-density lipoprotein to be capable of transmitting stimulus of the modified low-density lipoprotein to cell as a component of hybrid receptor constructs.</p>In more detail, the affinity (dissociation constant) of a particular molecule for standard oxidized low-density lipoprotein is not more than 1 \u00b5M. In the present invention, the affinity preferably is not more than 0.1 \u00b5M, and more preferably is not more than 0.01 \u00b5M.</p>The term \"biologically active\" also means that a particular molecule has a function of accelerating internalization of modified low-density lipoprotein into vascular endothelial cells.</p>The term \"DNA sequence\" means a DNA polymer, in the form of a separate fragment or as a component of larger DNA constructs. The DNA constructs are derived from DNA isolated at least once in essentially pure form (free of contaminating endogenous materials) and in a quantity or concentration enabling identification, manipulation, and recovery of the sequence and its component nucleotides sequences by standard biochemical methods, for example, using a cloning vector. The DNA sequences are preferably provided in the form of an open reading frame uninterrupted by internal nontranslated sequences, or introns, which are typically present in eukaryotic genes. However, genomic DNA containing the relevant sequences can also be used. Sequences of non-translated DNA may be present 5' or 3' from the open reading frame. The non-translated DNA does not interfere with manipulation or expression of the coding regions.</p>The term \"recombinant expression vector\" means a plasmid comprising a transcriptional unit. The unit comprises (a) a genetic element or elements having "
