    "ion column. The IgG or IgM fractions are collected and used as purified monoclonal antibodies. In addition, a monoclonal antibody that binds to CD3 or a disease-related antigen can be obtained by proliferating the hybridoma in the abdominal cavity of a mouse of the same strain (for example, BALB / c) or a Nu / Nu mouse, rat, guinea pig, hamster or rabbit. A large amount of ascites can be obtained.</p>\nThe monoclonal antibody-producing hybridoma obtained in (5) was cultured in RPMI1640 medium or the like to which 10% FBS was added, and then the supernatant was removed by centrifugation, and GIT medium or Hybridoma SFM medium to which 5% Daigo GF21 was added was added. Suspend in the medium and incubate for 3 to 7 days by flask culture, spinner culture, back culture, or the like. The obtained cell suspension can be centrifuged, and the obtained supernatant can be purified by a protein A column or a protein G column to collect an IgG fraction to obtain a purified monoclonal antibody. As a simple method for purification, a commercially available monoclonal antibody purification kit (for example, MAbTrap GII kit; manufactured by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or the like can also be used.\n</p>Determining antibody subclasses is performed by enzyme immunoassay using a subcluster typing kit.

It can be established using the anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody SP34 or KM14. For example, a desired CD3 binding domain can be established by screening an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody library for an antibody having a 10% or more lower affinity than the anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody SP34 or KM14. In addition, based on the CDR or VH / VL amino acid sequence of the anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody SP34 or KM14, an antibody library in which a random mutation was introduced into the amino acid sequence of the CDR or FR region was prepared, and the anti-CD3 antibody library was used. The desired CD3 binding domain can be established by screening for antibodies that have a 10% or greater affinity lower than the monoclonal antibody SP34 or KM14. The binding activity of a monoclonal antibody against CD3 or disease-related antigen can be measured by a binding assay system such as Ouchterlony, ELISA, RIA, flow cytometry (FCM) or surface plasmon resonance (SPR). can.</p>\nThe Octerlony method is simple, but if the antibody concentration is low, a concentration operation is required. On the other hand, when the ELISA method or the RIA method is used, the culture supernatant is directly reacted with the antigen-adsorbing solid phase, and various immunoglobulin isotypes and antibodies corresponding to the subclass are used as the secondary antibody to obtain the antibody isotype. It is possible to identify subclasses and measure antibody binding activity.\n</p>\nAs a specific example of the procedure, purified or partially purified recombinant CD3 or disease-related antigen is adsorbed on a solid phase surface such as a 96-well plate for ELISA, and the solid phase surface on which the antigen is not adsorbed is a protein unrelated to the antigen. , For example, blocking with bovine serum albumin (BSA). After washing the ELISA plate with phosphate buffer Saline (PBS) and PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Tween-PBS), a serially diluted first antibody (for example, mouse serum, culture supernatant, etc.) is reacted with the plate. The antibody is bound to the immobilized antigen. Next, as the second antibody, an anti-immunoglobulin antibody labeled with biotin, an enzyme (horseradish peroxidase; HRP, alkaline phosphatase; ALP, etc.), a chemiluminescent substance or a radiation compound, etc. was dispensed and bound to the plate. The sec",
    "a naturally occurring antigen.\n</p>\nExamples of the SPR method include kinetics analysis by Biacore. For example, using Biacore T100, kinetics in the binding between the antigen and the test substance is measured, and the result is analyzed by the analysis software attached to the device. As a specific example of the procedure, after fixing the anti-mouse IgG antibody to the sensor chip CM5 by the amine coupling method, a test substance such as a hybridoma culture supernatant or a purified monoclonal antibody is flowed to bind an appropriate amount, and the concentration is known. Multiple concentrations of antigen are run and binding and dissociation are measured. Next, the obtained data is subjected to kinetics analysis by a 1: 1 binding model using the software attached to the device, and various parameters are acquired. Alternatively, CD3 or disease-related antigen is immobilized on a sensor chip, for example, by an amine coupling method, and then a plurality of concentrations of purified monoclonal antibody of known concentration are flowed to measure binding and dissociation. The obtained data is subjected to kinetics analysis using a 1: 1 binding model or a bivalent binding model using software attached to the device, and various parameters are acquired.\n</p>\nFurther, in the present invention, an antibody that competes with an antibody against CD3 or a disease-related antigen and binds to CD3 or a disease-related antigen can be selected by reacting the above-mentioned binding assay system with a test antibody in coexistence. .. That is, by screening for an antibody whose binding to the antigen is inhibited when the test antibody is added, an antibody that competes with the antibody obtained above for binding to CD3 or a disease-related antigen can be obtained.\n</p>(8) Identification of an epitope of a monoclonal antibody against CD3 or a disease-related antigen In the present invention, the epitope that the antibody recognizes and binds to can be identified as follows.</p>\nFor example, if a partial deficiency of an antigen, a variant in which amino acid residues different between species are modified, or a variant in which a specific domain is modified is prepared, and the reactivity of the antibody to the deficiency or variant is reduced. It becomes clear that the defective site or the amino acid modification site is an epitope of the antibody. Partial deficiencies and variants of such antigens may be obtained as secretory proteins using suitable host cells such as Escherichia coli, yeast, plant cells or mammalian cells, or on the cell membrane of host cells. It may be expressed and prepared as an antigen-expressing cell. In the case of a membrane-type antigen, it is preferable to express it on the membrane of a host cell in order to express it while retaining the three-dimensional structure of the antigen. It is also possible to prepare a synthetic peptide that mimics the primary structure or three-dimensional structure of an antigen and confirm the reactivity of the antibody. Examples of the synthetic peptide include a method for producing various partial peptides of the molecule using a known peptide synthesis technique.\n</p>\nFor example, for the extracellular regions of human and mouse CD3 or disease-related antigens, a chimeric protein is prepared by appropriately combining the domains constituting each region, and the reactivity of the antibody to the protein is confirmed to obtain the epitope of the antibody. Can be identified. Then, in more detail, the oligopeptide of the corresponding portion, or a variant of the peptide, etc. are variously synthesized using an oligopeptide synthesis technique well known to those skilled in the art, and the reactivity of the antibody to the peptide is confirmed to confirm the epitope. Can be identified. As a simple method for obtaining various kinds of oligopeptides, a commercially available kit [for example, SPOTs kit (manufactured by Genosis Biotechnology), a series of multipin peptide synthesis kits using a multipin synthesis method (manufactured by Chiron), etc. ] Can also be used.\n</p>\nAn antibody that binds to the same epitope as an epitope that binds to CD3 or a disease-related antigen identifies an epitope of the antibody obtained by the above-mentioned binding assay system, and a partially synthetic peptide of the epitope, a steric structure of the epitope. It can be obtained by preparing a synthetic peptide imitating the structure, a recombinant of the epitope, or the like and immunizing it.\n</p>\nFor example, if the epitope is a membrane protein, a recombinant fusion protein in which the entire extracellular region or a part of the extracellular domain is linked to an appropriate tag such as FLAG tag, Histide tag, GST protein or antibody Fc region. By producing and immunizing the recombinant protein, the epitope-specific antibody can be produced more efficiently.\n</p>2.
