In a comparable study on J774 survival (see, e.g., reference Luckman et al., 1998), the bisphophonates alendronate and pamidronate had IC50 values that were 10 and 8 times higher respectively.\n2. Additionally, ABD-0056 (4BP) showed a significant effect at concentrations down to 10 \u03bcM.\n3. These compounds showed little activity at 100 \u03bcM concentration."}
