    "t compound was added at Day 7, and incubation continued until Day 10 (mature osteoclasts), are illustrated in Figure 18.</p>Compounds ABD-0056 (4BP) and ABD-0054 (6BP) significantly reduced rabbit osteoclast numbers and resorption activity. Additionally, ABD-0056 (4BP) showed a significant effect at concentrations down to 10 \u03bcM. Compounds ABD-0056 (4BP) and ABD-0054 (6BP) also significantly inhibited osteoclast formation in the murine co-culture system.</p>The effects on resorption pit area were more pronounced in the murine co-culture than in the rabbit osteoclast system. In the rabbit system, mature, resorbing osteoclasts are present from the start and may resorb bone for some time, until the compound starts affecting the cells. The co-culture system, \n\nhowever, depends on the actual formation of osteoclasts from non-resorbing precursors.</p>The results for osteoclast number and resorption pit area for the murine co-culture system, where test compound (ABD-0056) (4BP) was added at Day 7, and incubation continued until Day 10 (mature osteoclasts), are illustrated in Figure 19.</p>The results show that the 1 ,4-butanediol ester of biphenylcarboxylic acid (compound ABD-0056 (4BP)) is a potent inhibitor of osteoclast survival, formation and activity, and is 10 times more effective than any compounds of this class (other than ABD-0085 (10F)).</p>In a comparable study on J774 survival (see, e.g., reference Luckman et al., 1998), the bisphophonates alendronate and pamidronate had IC50 values that were 10 and 8 times higher respectively.</p>Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the biphenylcarboxylic acid conveys the lipophilicity needed for the compound to pass across the cell membrane.</p>Additional esters of 1 ,4-butanediol were prepared and tested, specifically, the naphth-1-ylacetyl (compound ABD-0032 (4N)), homoveratryl (compound ABD-0033 (4H)), 2-biphenyIcarboxy (compound ABD-0059 (4BPX)) and 4-phenyltoluyl (compound ABD-0034 (4PT)) derivatives. These compounds showed little activity at 100 \u03bcM concentration.</p>Without wishing to be bound to any particular theory, it is believed that the activity _of the compounds is related to the overall shape of the molecule. The I, BP and BPA derivatives can be regarded as broadly linear, whereas the BPX and N derivatives are bent out of the linear plane. That the H and PT derivatives are inactive suggests that the molecular target will only accommodate \n\na specific size of compound, and that the homoveratrate compound is too small or insufficiently lipophilic and the phenyltoluate compound is too long or too flexible.</p>It is believed that one preferred class of compounds will be of a generally rigid, cylindrical shape, and be based on the biphenyl structure. A sub-class of such compounds are those with a further 4'-substituent on the biphenyl group. Another sub-class of such compounds are those with further 2'- and 4'-substituents on the biphenyl group.
