However, such continuous intravenous infusions are inconvenient for patients and may increase the costs of treatment. </p>[0007] Although significant developments have been made in constructing anti-CD 19 antibodies and multi-specific binding proteins, there remains a need for new and useful proteins for treating cancer that have adequate therapeutic efficacy, a format straightforward to manufacture, and favorable pharmacokinetic properties such as a longer half-life. </p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>[0008] The present invention is based, in part, upon the development of new antibodies that bind CD 19. Also provided are multi-specific binding proteins comprising a first domain that binds CD19 (e.g., human CD19), a second domain that binds CD3 (e.g., human CD3), and optionally a half-life extension domain, which can be a third domain that binds serum albumin (e.g., human serum albumin), wherein the first domain is derived from these new antibodies. These domains are linked in certain manners for favorable therapeutic efficacy and in vivo half- life. The anti-CD 19 antibodies and multi-specific binding proteins are useful for treating \n\ndiseases and disorders associated with aberrant cells expressing CD 19, such as certain B-cell hematologic malignancies. </p>[0009] Accordingly, in one aspect, the present disclosure provides a multi-specific binding protein comprising: (a) a first antigen-binding site that binds human CD 19 with a KD within the range of 5 pM to 1 nM; and (b) a second antigen-binding site that binds human CD3 with a KD within the range of 0.5 nM to 20 nM. </p>[0010] In certain embodiments, the multi-specific binding protein is a fusion protein comprising the first and second antigen binding sites.

In certain embodiments, the half-life extension domain is not disposed between the first antigen-binding site and the second antigen-binding site in a polypeptide chain. </p>[0011] In certain embodiments, each KD is measured by surface plasmon resonance. In certain embodiments, the first antigen-binding site binds human CD 19 with a KD within the range of 5 pM to 0.1 nM, and the second antigen-binding site binds human CD3 with a KD within the range of 0.5 nM to 10 nM.

In certain embodiments, the antigen-binding site derived from CNG-HSA-101, CNG-HSA-102, CNG-HSA-104, CNG-HSA-109, CNG-HSA-113, CNG- HSA-116, or CNG-HSA-117 binds human serum albumin with a KD in the range of 1-10 nM, 1- 9 nM, 1-8 nM, 1-7 nM, 1-6 nM, 1-5 nM, 1-4 nM, or 1-3 nM and binds protein A with a KD in the range of 1-2.5 nM or 1-2 nM, as measured by SPR when the antigen-binding site is present as a monomer. </p>[0206] In certain embodiments, the antigen-binding site derived from CNG-HSA-101, CNG- HSA-102, CNG-HSA-104, CNG-HSA-109, CNG-HSA-116, or CNG-HSA-117 has a higher binding affinity to human serum albumin and a higher affinity to protein A relative to an antigen-binding site having VH sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 196. In certain embodiments, the antigen-binding site derived from CNG-HSA-101, CNG-HSA-102, CNG-HSA-104, CNG- HSA-109, CNG-HSA-116, or CNG-HSA-117 binds protein A with a KD lower than or equal to 2.5 nM or 2 nM, as measured by SPR when the antigen-binding site is present as a monomer. In certain embodiments, the antigen-binding site derived from CNG-HSA-101, CNG-HSA-102, CNG-HSA-104, CNG-HSA-109, CNG-HSA-116, or CNG-HSA-117 binds protein A with a KD in the range of 1-2.5 nM or 1-2 nM, as measured by SPR when the antigen-binding site is present as a monomer. \n\n [0207] Melting temperature represents the thermostability of the antigen-binding site and can be measured by differential scanning fluorimetry, for example, as described in Durowoju et al. (2017) J. Vis. Exp. (121): 55262. The thermostability of an antibody or fragment thereof may be enhanced by grafting CDRs onto stable frameworks, introducing non-canonical disulfide bonds, and other mutagenesis, as described in McConnell et al. (2014) MAbs, 6(5): 1274-82; and</p>Goldman et al. (2017) Front. Immunol., 8: 865. In certain embodiments, the antigen-binding site derived from CNG-HSA-101, CNG-HSA-102, CNG-HSA-103, CNG-HSA-104, CNG-HSA- 105, CNG-HSA-106, CNG-HSA-108, CNG-HSA-109, CNG-HSA-113, CNG-HSA-116, CNG- HSA-117, or CNG-HSA-120 has a melting temperature greater than or equal to 60 \u00b0C, as measured by differential scanning fluorimetry. In certain embodiments, the antigen-binding site derived from CNG-HSA-101, CNG-HSA-102, CNG-HSA-103, CNG-HSA-106, or CNG-HSA- 120 has a melting temperature greater than or equal to 65 \u00b0C, as measured by differential scanning fluorimetry. </p>[0208] In certain embodiments, the third antigen-binding site competes for binding serum (e.g., human serum albumin) and/or competes for binding protein A with an antibody or antigenbinding site comprising the VH sequence provided in Table 5. </p>[0209] Alternatively, the third antigen-binding s",
    "/mL, 45 mg/mL, or 50 mg/mL serum albumin (e.g., HSA). </p>[0280] In certain embodiments, the multi-specific binding protein of the present disclosure kills CD 19-expressing cells with a similar EC<sub>50</sub> value in the presence of serum albumin to that in the absence or substantial absence of serum albumin. In certain embodiments, the EC<sub>50</sub> value of the multi-specific binding protein for killing CD 19-expressing cells in the presence of serum albumin is increased by no more than 1.5 fold, 2 fold, 3 fold, 4 fold, 5 fold, 6 fold, 7 fold, 8 fold, 9 fold, 10 fold, 15 fold, 20 fold, 25 fold, 30 fold, 35 fold, 40 fold, 45 fold, or 50 fold compared to that in the absence or substantial absence of serum albumin. It is understood that the presence of serum albumin (e.g., about 10 mg/mL, 15 mg/mL, 20 mg/mL, 25 mg/mL, 30 mg/mL, 35 mg/mL, 40 mg/mL, 45 mg/mL, or 50 mg/mL serum albumin) may also alter the EC<sub>50</sub> value of a multi- specific binding protein nonspecifically. The nonspecific effect can be assessed by comparing the EC<sub>50</sub> values of a control protein, which does not contain a serum albumin binding domain, in the presence and absence of serum albumin. In certain embodiments, the fold change is offset by the nonspecific effect of serum albumin on a control protein, such as a bispecific protein that binds CD 19 and CD3. </p>I. Construct Size </p>[0281] In certain embodiments, the molecular weight of the multi-specific binding protein is from about 40 kD to about 100 kD. In certain embodiments, the molecular weight of the multi- specific binding protein is at least 60 kD, at least 65 kD, at least 70 kD, at least 75 kD, at least 80 kD, at least 85 kD, at least 90 kD, or at least 95 kD. It is understood that smaller size generally contributes to faster diffusion and tissue penetration, but size reduction may not be as critical for the purpose of treating the indications with substantial presence of target cells (e.g. , cancer cells) in the blood. </p>[0282] In certain embodiments, the molecular weight of the multi-specific binding protein is from about about 40 kD to about 90 kD, from about 40 kD to about 80 kD, from about 40 kD to about 70 kD, from about 40 kD to about 60 kD, from about 40 kD to about 50 kD, from about 50 kD to about 100 kD, from about 50 kD to about 90 kD, from about 50 kD to about 80 kD, from \n\nabout 50 kD to about 70 kD, from about 50 kD to about 60 kD, from about 60 kD to about 100 kD, from about 60 kD to about 90 kD, from about 60 kD to about 80 kD, from about 60 kD to about 70 kD, from about 65 kD to about 100 kD, from about 65 kD to about 90 kD, from about 65 kD to about 80 kD, from about 65 kD to about 70 kD, from about 70 kD to about 100 kD, from about 70 kD to about 90 kD, from about 70 kD to about 80 kD, from about 80 kD to about 100 kD, from about 80 kD to about 90 kD, or from about 90 kD to about 100 kD. In certain embodiments, the multi-specific binding protein is lower than 40 kD. In certain embodiments, the multi-specific binding protein is about 50 kD - about 90 kD, about 50 kD - about 80 kD, about 50 kD - about 70 kD, about 50 kD - about 60 kD, about 60 kD - about 90 kD, about 60 kD - about 80 kD, about 60 kD - about 70 kD, about 65 kD - about 90 kD, about 65 kD - about 80 kD, about 65 kD - about 70 kD, about 70 kD - about 90 kD, or about 70 kD - about 80 kD. </p>J. Serum Half-life </p>[0283] Fusion proteins have been developed to increase the in vivo half-life of a small protein, particularly an antibody fragment. For example, fusion with a heterodimeric antibody Fc region, such as an Fc with one or more mutations that extend the in vivo half-life, is described in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. US20140302037A1, US20140308285A1, and PCT Publication Nos . WO2014144722A2, WO2014151910A 1 and WO2015048272A 1. An alternative strategy is fusion with human serum albumin (HSA) or an HSA-binding peptide (see, e.g., PCT Publication Nos. WO2013128027A1 and WO2014140358A1). The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) appears to be involved in prolonging the life-span of albumin in circulation (see, Chaudhury et al. (2003) J. Exp. Med., 3: 315-22). Albumin and IgG bind noncooperatively to distinct sites of FcRn and form a tri-molecular (see id). Binding of human FcRn to HSA and to human IgG is pH dependent, stronger at acidic pH and weaker at neutral or physiological pH (see id.). This observation suggests that proteins and protein complexes containing albumin, similar to those containing IgG (particularly Fc), are protected from degradation through pH- sensitive interaction with FcRn (see id.). Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to measure the capacity of individual HSA domains to bind immobilized soluble human FcRn, it has been shown that FcRn and albumin interact via the D-III domain of albumin in a pH-dependent manner, on a site dist",
    "r of both PARPl and DHODH, a Proteasome Inhibitor, a Topoisomerase-II Inhibitor, a Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor, a VEGFR Inhibitor, and a WEE1 Inhibitor; (ii) an agonist of 0X40, CD 137, CD40, GITR, CD27, HVEM, TNFRSF25, or ICOS; and (iii) a cytokine selected from IL-12, IL-15, GM-CSF, and G-CSF. </p>[0332] It is understood that the antibody or multi-specific binding protein disclosed herein, which is designed to activate T lymphocytes, may cause side effects such as neurotoxicity. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the second therapeutic agent that can be used in combination with the antibody or multi-specific binding protein comprises an agent that mitigates a side effect of the antibody or multi-specific binding protein, e.g., reduces neurotoxicity. In certain embodiments, the second therapeutic agent inhibits T cell trafficking, for example, reduces or inhibits immune cells from crossing the blood-brain barrier. Nonlimiting examples of such therapeutic agents include antagonists (e.g., antagonistic antibodies) of adhesion molecules on immune cells (e.g., a4 integrin), such as natalizumab. In certain embodiments, the second therapeutic agent increases the internalization of a sphingosine-1- phosphate (SIP) receptor (e.g., S1PR1 or S1PR5), such as fingolimod or ozanimod. In certain embodiments, the second therapeutic agent is a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, such as ronopterin, cindunistat, A- 84643, ONO-1714, L-NOARG, NCX-456, VAS-2381, GW-273629, NXN-462, CKD-712, KD- 7040, or guanidinoethyldisulfide. In certain embodiments, the second therapeutic agent is an antagonist of CSF1 or CSF1R, such as pexidartinib, emactuzumab, cabiralizumab, LY-3022855, JNJ-40346527, or MCS110. Additional non-limiting examples of the second therapeutic agents include pentosan polysulfate, minocycline, anti-ICAM-1 antibodies, anti-P-selectin antibodies, anti-CD 1 la antibodies, anti-CD 162 antibodies, and anti- IL-6R antibodies (e.g., tocilizumab). \n\n[0333] The amount of the antibody or multi-specific binding protein and additional therapeutic agent and the relative timing of administration may be selected in order to achieve a desired combined therapeutic effect. For example, when administering a combination therapy to a patient in need of such administration, the therapeutic agents in the combination, or a pharmaceutical composition or compositions comprising the therapeutic agents, may be administered in any order such as, for example, sequentially, concurrently, together, simultaneously and the like. Further, for example, an antibody or multi-specific binding protein may be administered during a time when the additional therapeutic agent(s) exerts its prophylactic or therapeutic effect, or vice versa. </p>[0334] Throughout the description, where compositions are described as having, including, or comprising specific components, or where processes and methods are described as having, including, or comprising specific steps, it is contemplated that, additi",

The sensors with loaded IgGs were exposed to 100 nM human serum albumin for 3 minutes, and subsequently transferred to assay buffer for 3 minutes for off-rate measurement. All kinetics were analyzed using the 1:1 binding model. </p>[0347] The binding affinity of the antibodies to CD 19 expressed on the cell surface was also measured. Briefly, approximately 100,000 Chinese hamster overy (CHO) cells overexpressing the antigen were washed with wash buffer and incubated with 100 pi 100 nM IgG for 15 minutes at room temperature. Cells were then washed twice with wash buffer and incubated with 100 m\u0390 of 1: 100 Human-PE for 15 minutes on ice. Cells were then washed twice more with wash buffer and analyzed on a FACS Canto II analyzer (BD Biosciences). </p>Table 9.

The scFv proteins were serially diluted and assessed at 25\u00b0 C in a HBS-EP+ running buffer system (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl,</p>3 mM EDTA, 0.05% Surfactant P20) using a Biacore 8K optical biosensor (Global Life Sciences Solutions USA, Marlborough, MA). The sample compartment was maintained at 10 \u00b0C for the duration of each experiment. [0351] Each experiment cycle began with an injection (500 s at 2 pL/min) over flow cells 1 and 2 of a 1:20 solution of biotin CAPture reagent (Global Life Sciences Solutions USA) in running buffer. This was followed by an injection (300 s at 4.0 pL/min) of biotinylated CD-19 (40 nM) overflow cell 2. Upon capture of CD19 to the sensor surface, test scFvs (16.2 to 0.067 nM, 3 -fold dilution in running buffer) was injected (300 s at 30 uL/min) over flow cells 1 and 2. The dissociation of the scFvs was monitored for a duration of 2564 s. Finally, an injection (90 s at 10 pL/min) of regeneration solution (6 M Guanidine-HCl in 0.25 M NaOH) overflow cells 1 and 2 was used to prepare the sensor surface for another cycle. </p>[0352] The resulting data were processed and fit as follows. Sensorgrams were cropped to include only the scFv association and dissociation steps. The cropped data was subsequently aligned, double reference subtracted, and then non-linear least squares fit to a 1 : 1 binding model using Biacore Insight Evaluation software version 3.0.11.15423.

The amino acid sequences of these antibodies are provided in Table 5 above. </p>[0355] CNG-HSA-101 to -120 were optimized from parental antibodies CNG-HSA-1, a single domain antibody, by introducing diversities into the heavy chain variable region, generating random mutations by error prone PCR, and shuffling the VH fragments. The antibody clones were selected for improved binding affinity to biotinylated human serum albumin relative to the parental antibody. Additionally, a thermal selection pressure was employed for the VH shuffle optimization cycle. Thermal selection pressures were applied by incubating the libraries at various temperatures and then selecting for antibodies that retained antigen binding following thermal incubation. The selected antibodies were then produced from yeast cells and purified using a protein A column. </p>[0356] The binding affinity of the anti",

All kinetics were analyzed using the 1:1 binding model. </p>[0357] The melting temperature (Tm) of the VHH fragments were measured by dynamic scanning fluorimetry (DSF). Briefly, 10 pL of 20X Sypro Orange dye is added to 20 pL of 0.2-1 mg/mL HCAb. A BioRad CFX96 RT PCR machine was used to raise the sample plate temperature from 40 \u00b0 to 95 \u00b0C at 0.5 \u00b0C increments, with 2 minutes equilibration at each temperature.
