    "d as a control cell line not expressing PSMA. The cells were blocked with 10% goat serum on ice to reduce non-specific binding in this assay.</p>A small amount (1-5 ng) of labeled mAb was added into a cell pellet of 10 million cells and incubated at 0\u00b0C (on ice) with gentle mixing. After a 1 hour incubation, the cells were collected by centrifugation and the supernatant containing unbound mAb was transferred to a fresh cell pellet for an additional 1 hour incubation at 0\u00b0C. Both sets of cells were centrifuged and washed twice with cold PBS. The cell pellets, supernatant and wash fractions were counted for radioactivity. Immunoreactivity is defined as the amount of radioactivity in the cell pellets divided by the total radioactivity in the cell pellets, supernatant and wash fractions. These data are shown below in Table 3.\nTable 3.

The cells were incubated at 0\u00b0C for 30 min. 20 \u00b5L of In-111 radiolabeled CHX-A\"-DTPA antibody constructs were added into each well. After a 2 hour incubation on ice for competition binding, the cells were washed 5 times using cold PBS. The cells containing bound In-111 antibodies were recovered from microplates into test tubes and counted in a gamma counter.</p>Results detailed in Figures 29 show that mJ591 blocked In-111 4.40 binding to PSMA-3T3 cells and did not block In-111 4.304. In addition, 4.40 and 4.304 did not block each other. Unmodified antibodies 4.304 and mJ591 were also used to compete with In-111 radiolabeled mJ591. Human 4.304 did not compete with In-111 mJ591 for binding to PSMA-3T3 (Figure 30).</p>Example 22: Binding affinity using Biacore 3000To determine the kinetics and affinity of the antibodies, the antibodies in crude supernatants, in purified form and in bifunctional chelate modified forms were analyzed using a Biacore 3000 instrument (Biacore Inc., Piscataway, NJ). Biacore 3000 is a fully automated surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based biosensor system t"
