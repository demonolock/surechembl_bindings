Reactions were conducted in 384-well white, medium binding microtiter plates (Greiner). Kinase reactions were initiated by combining test compounds, ATP, substrate (PIP2), and kinase in a 20 \u03bcL volume in a buffer solution. The standard PDKalpha assay buffer is composed 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT and 0.03% CHAPS. The standard assay concentrations for enzyme, ATP, and substrate are 0.5-1.1 nM, l\u03bcM, and 7.5 \u03bcM, respectively. The reaction mixture was incubated at ambient temperature for approximately 2 h. Following the kinase reaction, a 10 \u03bcL aliquot of luciferase-luciferin mix (Promega Kinase-Glo) was added and the chemiluminescence signal measured using a Victor2 plate reader (Perkin Elmer). Total ATP consumption was limited to 40-60% and IC50 values of control compounds correlate well with literature references. [00342] Certain compounds of the invention were tested in this assay and demonstrated the ability to bind to PI3K. For example, in one embodiment of the invention, the PI3K inhibitor is \n\n selected from the compounds in Table 1 having a PI3K-binding affinity of about 9 \u03bcM or less. In another embodiment, the PI3K inhibitor is selected from the compounds in Table 1 having a PI3K-binding affinity of about 5 \u03bcM or less. In another embodiment, the PI3K inhibitor is selected from the compounds in Table 1 having a PI3K-binding affinity of about 3 \u03bcM or less. In another embodiment, the PI3K inhibitor is selected from the compounds in Table 1 having a PI3K-binding affinity of about 1.5 \u03bcM or less. In another embodiment, the PI3K inhibitor is selected from the compounds in Table 1 having a PI3K-binding affinity of about 1 \u03bcM or less. In another embodiment, the PI3K inhibitor is selected from the compounds in Table 1 having a PI3K-binding affinity of about 0.6 \u03bcM or less.
