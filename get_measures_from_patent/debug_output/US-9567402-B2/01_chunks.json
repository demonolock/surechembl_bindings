Nucleic acids containing one or more carbocyclic sugars are also included within the definition of nucleic acids (see Jenkins et al. (1995), Chem. Soc. Rev. pp 169-176). Several nucleic acid analogs are described in Rawls, C &amp; E News Jun. 2, 1997 page 35. These modifications of the ribose-phosphate backbone may be done to facilitate the addition of additional moieties such as labels, or to increase the stability and half-life of such molecules in physiological environments.</p>The term \u201cresidue\u201d as used herein refers to natural, synthetic, or modified amino acids.</p>As used herein, an \u201cantibody\u201d refers to a protein consisting of one or more polypeptides substantially encoded by immunoglobulin genes or fragments of immunoglobulin genes. The recognized immunoglobulin genes include the kappa, lambda, alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon and mu constant region genes, as well as myriad immunoglobulin variable region genes. Light chains are classified as either kappa or lambda. Heavy chains are classified as gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon, which in turn define the immunoglobulin classes, IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE, respectively.</p>A typical immunoglobulin (antibody) structural unit is known to comprise a tetramer. Each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one \u201clight\u201d (about 25 kD) and one \u201cheavy\u201d chain (about 50-70 kD). The N-terminus of each chain defines a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The terms variable light chain (V<sub>L</sub>) and variable heavy chain (V<sub>H</sub>) refer to these light and heavy chains respectively.</p>Antibodies exist as intact immunoglobulins or as a number of well characterized fragments produced by digestion with various peptidases. Thus, for example, pepsin digests an antibody below the disulfide linkages in the hinge region to produce F(ab)\u2032<sub>2</sub>, a dimer of Fab which itself is a light chain joined to V<sub>H</sub>-C<sub>H</sub>1 by a disulfide bond. The F(ab)\u2032<sub>2 </sub>may be reduced under mild conditions to break the disulfide linkage in the hinge region thereby converting the (Fab\u2032)<sub>2 </sub>dimer into a Fab\u2032 monomer. The Fab\u2032 monomer is essentially a Fab with part of the hinge region (see, Fundamental Immunology, W. E. Paul, ed., Raven Press, N.Y. (1993), for a more detailed description of other antibody fragments). While various antibody fragments are defined in terms of the digestion of an intact antibody, one of skill will appreciate that such Fab\u2032 fragments may be synthesized de novo either chemically or by utilizing recombinant DNA methodology. Thus, the term antibody, as used herein also includes antibody fragments either produced by the modification of whole antibodies or synthesized de novo using recombinant DNA methodologies. Certain preferred antibodies inc",
    "naceous entity or peptide) to which an antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof binds. In various embodiments of the present invention, an antigen is CD46 CPP1, e.g., as presented on a cell (e.g., a CD46 positive cancer cell).</p>The term \u201cepitope\u201d or \u201cantigenic determinant\u201d refers to a site on an antigen to which an immunoglobulin or antibody specifically binds. Epitopes can be formed both from contiguous amino acids or noncontiguous amino acids juxtaposed by tertiary folding of a protein. Epitopes formed from contiguous amino acids are typically retained on exposure to denaturing solvents, whereas epitopes formed by tertiary folding are typically lost on treatment with denaturing solvents. An epitope typically includes at least 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 or 15 amino acids in a unique spatial conformation. Methods of determining spatial conformation of epitopes include techniques in the art and those described herein, for example, x-ray crystallography and 2-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (see, e.g., Epitope Mapping Protocols in Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol. 66, G. E. Morris, Ed. (1996)).</p>Also contemplated herein are antibodies that bind the same or an overlapping epitope as the 2B10 antibody described. Antibodies that recognize the same epitope can be identified using routine techniques such as an immunoassay, for example, by showing the ability of one antibody to block the binding of another antibody to a target antigen, i.e., a competitive binding assay. Competitive binding is determined in an assay in which the immunoglobulin under test inhibits specific binding of a reference antibody to a common antigen, such as CD46 CPP1, more preferably the epitope of SEQ ID NO:1. Numerous types of competitive binding assays are known, for example: solid phase direct or indirect radioimmunoassay (RIA), solid phase direct or indirect enzyme immunoassay (EIA), sandwich competition assay (see, e.g., Stahli et al. (1983) Meth. Enzymol., 9: 242); solid phase direct biotin-avidin EIA (see Kirkland et al., (1986) J. Immunol. 137: 3614); solid phase direct labeled assay, solid phase direct labeled sandwich assay (see, e.g., Harlow and Lane (1988) Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Press); solid phase direct label RIA using, e.g., <sup>125</sup>I label (see, e.g., Morel et al., (1988) Mol. Immunol. 25(1): 7); solid phase direct biotin-avidin EIA (Cheung et al. (1990) Virology 176: 546); and direct labeled RIA. (Moldenhauer et al. (1990) Scand J. Immunol. 32: 77). Typically, such an assay involves the use of purified antigen (e.g., CD46 sushi domain 1 (CPP1)) bound to a solid surface or cells bearing either of these, an unlabeled test immunoglobulin and a labeled reference immunoglobulin. Competitive inhibition is measured by determining the amount of label bound to the solid surface or cells in the presence of the test immunoglobulin. Usually the test immunoglobulin is present in excess. Usually, when a competing antibody is present in excess, it will inhibit specific binding of a reference antibody to a common antigen by at least 50-55%, 55-60%, 60-65%, 65-70% 70-75% or more.</p>As used herein, the terms \u201cspecific binding,\u201d \u201cspecifically binds,\u201d \u201cselective binding,\u201d and \u201cselectively binds,\u201d mean that an antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof, exhibits appreciable affinity for a particular antigen or epitope and, generally, does not exhibit significant cross-reactivity with other antigens and epitopes. \u201cAppreciable\u201d or preferred binding includes binding with an affinity of at least (KD equal to or less than) 10<sup>\u22126 </sup>M, 10<sup>\u22127</sup>M, 10<sup>\u22128</sup>M, 10<sup>\u22129</sup>M, 10<sup>\u221210 </sup>M, or 10<sup>\u221211 </sup>M. Affinities greater than 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>M, preferably greater than 10<sup>\u221210 </sup>M are more preferred. Values intermediate of those set forth herein are also intended to be within the scope of the present invention and a preferred binding affinity can be indicated as a range of affinities, for example, 10<sup>\u22126 </sup>M to 10<sup>\u221211 </sup>M, preferably 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>M or 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M to 10<sup>\u221210 </sup>M. An antibody that \u201cdoes not exhibit significant cross-reactivity\u201d is one that will not appreciably bind to an undesirable entity (e.g., an undesirable proteinaceous entity). For example, in one embodiment, an antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof that specifically binds to CD46 CPP1 appreciably bind that CD46 CPP1 protein but will not significantly react with other molecules and non-CD46 proteins or peptides. Specific or selective binding can be determined according to any art-recognized means for determining such binding, including, for example, according to Scatchard analysis and/or competitive binding assays.</p>The term \u201cK<sub>D</sub>,\u201d as used herein, is intended to refer to the dissociation equilibrium constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction or the affinity of an antibody for an antigen. In one embodiment, the antibody or antigen binding portion thereof according to the present invention binds an antigen (e.g., CD46-CPP1) with an affinity (K<sub>D</sub>) of 5 nM or better (i.e., or less) (e.g., 40 nM or 30 nM or 20 nM or 10 nM or less), as measured using a surface plasmon resonance assay or a cell binding assay. In a particular embodiment, an antibody or antigen binding portion thereof according to the present invention binds CD46 CPP1 with an affinity (K<sub>D</sub>) of 5 nM or better (e.g., 4 nM, 2 nM, 1.5 nM, 1.4 nM, 1.3 nM, 1 nM or less), as measured by a surface plasmon resonance assay or a cell binding assay. In other embodiments, an antibody or antigen binding portion thereof binds an antigen (e.g., CD46 CPP1) with an affinity (K<sub>D</sub>) of approximately less than 10<sup>\u221210 </sup>M, or 100\u00d710<sup>\u221211 </sup>M, or 10\u00d710<sup>\u221211 </sup>M, or even lower using live prostate tumor cells by FACS.</p>The term \u201cK<sub>off</sub>,\u201d as used herein, is intended to refer to the off rate constant for the dissociation of an antibody from the antibody/antigen complex.</p>The term \u201cEC50,\u201d as used herein, refers to the concentration of an antibody or an antigen-binding portion thereof or an immunoconjugate described herein, that induces a response, either in an in vitro or an in vivo assay, which is 50% of the maximal response, i.e., halfway between the maximal response and the baseline.</p>The term \u201cnaturally-occurring\u201d as used herein as applied to an object refers to the fact that an object can be found in nature. For example, a polypeptide or polynucleotide sequence that is present in an organism (including viruses) that can be isolated from a source in nature and which has not been intentionally modified by man in the laboratory is naturally-occurring.</p>The term \u201cmodifying,\u201d or \u201cmodification,\u201d as used herein, is intended to refer to changing one or more amino acids in the antibodies or antigen-binding portions thereof. The change can be produced by adding, substituting or deleting an amino acid at one or more positions. The change can be produced using known techniques, such as PCR mutagenesis. For example, in some embodiments, an antibody or an antigen-binding portion thereof identified using the methods of the invention can be modified, to thereby modify the binding affinity of the antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof to CD46 CPP1.</p>In certain embodiments \u201cconservative amino acid substitutions\u201d in the sequences of the anti-CD46 CPP1 antibodies described herein, i.e., nucleotide and amino acid sequence modifications that do not abrogate t",
    "an antibody fragment (e.g., Fv, Fab, (Fab\u2032)<sub>2</sub>, (Fab\u2032)<sub>3</sub>, IgG\u0394CH<sub>2</sub>, a minibody, and the like), a single chain antibody (e.g., scFv), a diabody, a unibody, an affibody, and the like.</p>It will be recognized, that where the antibodies are single chain antibodies, the VH and VL domains comprising such antibody can be joined directly together or by a peptide linker. Illustrative peptide linkers include, but are not limited to GGGGS GGGGS GGGGS (SEQ ID NO:2), GGGGS GGGGS (SEQ ID NO:3), GGGGS (SEQ ID NO:4), GS GGGGS GGGGS GGS GGGGS (SEQ ID NO:5), SGGGGS (SEQ ID NO:6), GGGS (SEQ ID NO:7), VPGV (SEQ ID NO:8), VPGVG (SEQ ID NO:9), GVPGVG (SEQ ID NO:10), GVG VP GVG (SEQ ID NO:11), VP GVG VP GVG (SEQ ID NO:12), GGSSRSS (SEQ ID NO:13), and GGSSRSSSSGGGGSGGGG (SEQ ID NO:14), and the like.</p>As indicated above, in various embodiments, the antibody binds (e.g., specifically binds CD46 sushi domain 1 (CCP1), and more preferably binds to an epitope consisting of or comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1. Typically antibodies contemplated herein will specifically bind prostate cancer cells including, but not limited to cells of a cell line selected from the group consisting of DU145 cells, PC3 cells, and LnCaP cells. In certain embodiments the antibody binds to a prostate tumor cell with an affinity greater than (K<sub>D </sub>less than) about 5 nM when measured on live prostate tumor cells by FACS. In certain embodiments the affinity is greater than (KD less than) about 1 nM, or at about 100 pM, or about 50 pM, or about 10 pM, or about 1 pM.</p>Using the sequence information provided herein antibodies comprising one or more of the CDRs comprising, e.g., 2B10, or antibodies comprising the VH and/or VL domain(s) of these antibodies can readily be prepared using standard methods (e.g. chemical synthesis methods and/or recombinant expression methods) well known to those of skill in the art, e.g., as described below.</p>In addition, other \u201crelated\u201d prostate cancer specific antibodies can be identified by screening for antibodies that bind to the same epitope (e.g., CD46 sushi domain 1 and/or an epitope comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 (e.g. that compete with the 2B10 antibody for binding to a prostate cancer cell) and/or by modification of the 2B10 antibody identified herein to produce libraries of modified antibody and then rescreening antibodies in the library for improved binding to prostate cancer cells, specifically to CD46 sushi domain 1.</p>Identification of Other Antibodies Binding the Same CD46 CCP1 Epitope(s) as 2B10.</p>Having identified CD46 CCP1, preferably the epitope of SEQ ID NO:1 as a useful antibody target and 2B10 antibody as a useful prototypical antibody, other \u201crelated\u201d antibodies that bind CD46 CCP1, preferably binding the epitope of SEQ ID NO:1 can readily be identified by screening for antibodies that bind CD46 CCP1 (especially SEQ ID NO:1), e.g., by raising (e.g., monoclonal antibodie",
    "eferably binding the epitope of SEQ ID NO:1 can be prepared using a transgenic plant and/or cultured plant cells (such as, for example, tobacco, maize and duckweed) that produce such antibodies. For example, transgenic tobacco leaves expressing antibodies or antigen binding portions thereof can be used to produce such antibodies by, for example, using an inducible promoter (see, e.g., Cramer et al. (1999) Curr. Top. Microbol. Immunol. 240: 95-118). Also, transgenic maize can be used to express such antibodies and antigen binding portions thereof (see, e.g., Hood et al. (1999) Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 464: 127-147). Antibodies can also be produced in large amounts from transgenic plant seeds including antibody portions, such as single chain antibodies (scFv's), for example, using tobacco seeds and potato tubers (see, e.g., Conrad et al. (1998) Plant Mol. Biol. 38: 101-109). Methods of producing antibodies or antigen binding portions in plants can also be found in, e.g., Fischer et al. (1999) Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 30: 99-108, Ma et al. (1995) Trends Biotechnol. 13: 522-527, Ma et al. (1995) Plant Physiol. 109: 341-346; Whitelam et al. (1994) Biochem. Soc. Trans. 22: 940-944, and U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,040,498 and 6,815,184.</p>The binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies or portions thereof that bind CD46 CCP1, preferably comprising the epitope of SEQ ID NO:61 prepared using any technique including those disclosed here, can be determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). The binding affinity of a monoclonal antibody or portion thereof also can be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson et al. (1980) Anal. Biochem., 107:220.</p>Cross-Reactivity with Anti-Idiotypic Antibodies.</p>The idiotype represents the highly variable antigen-binding site of an antibody and is itself immunogenic. During the generation of an antibody-mediated immune response, an individual will develop antibodies to the antigen as well as anti-idiotype antibodies, whose immunogenic binding site (idiotype) mimics the antigen.</p>Anti-idiotypic antibodies can be raised against the variable regions of the antibodies identified herein (e.g., 2B10) using standard methods well known to those of skill in the art. Briefly, anti-idiotype antibodies can be made by injecting the antibodies of this invention, or fragments thereof (e.g., CDRs) into an animal thereby eliciting antisera against various antigenic determinants on the antibody, including determinants in the idiotypic region.</p>Methods for the production of anti-analyte antibodies are well known in the art. Large molecular weight antigens (greater than approx. 5000 Daltons) can be injected directly into animals, whereas small molecular weight compounds (less than approx. 5000 Daltons) are preferably coupled to a high molecular weight immunogenic carrier, usually a protein, to render them immunogenic. The antibodies produced i",
    "PP1 (e.g., a prostate cancer specific) antibody. The novel recombinant DNA vector contains a \u201creplacement gene\u201d to replace all or a portion of the gene encoding the immunoglobulin constant region in the cell line (e.g., a replacement gene may encode all or a portion of a constant region of a human immunoglobulin, a specific immunoglobulin class, or an enzyme, a toxin, a biologically active peptide, a growth factor, inhibitor, or a linker peptide to facilitate conjugation to a drug, toxin, or other molecule, etc.), and a \u201ctarget sequence\u201d that allows for targeted homologous recombination with immunoglobulin sequences within the antibody producing cell.</p>In another embodiment, a recombinant DNA vector is used to transfect a cell line that produces an antibody having a desired effector function, (e.g., a constant region of a human immunoglobulin) in which case, the replacement gene contained in the recombinant vector may encode all or a portion of a region of a prostate cancer specific antibody of this invention and the target sequence contained in the recombinant vector allows for homologous recombination and targeted gene modification within the antibody producing cell. In either embodiment, when only a portion of the variable or constant region is replaced, the resulting chimeric antibody can define the same antigen and/or have the same effector function yet be altered or improved so that the chimeric antibody may demonstrate a greater antigen specificity, greater affinity binding constant, increased effector function, or increased secretion and production by the transfected antibody producing cell line, etc.</p>Regardless of the embodiment practiced, the processes of selection for integrated DNA (via a selectable marker), screening for chimeric antibody production, and cell cloning, can be used to obtain a clone of cells producing the chimeric antibody.</p>Thus, a piece of DNA that encodes a modification for a monoclonal antibody can be targeted directly to the site of the expressed immunoglobulin gene within a B-cell or hybridoma cell line. DNA constructs for any particular modification can be made to alter the protein product of any monoclonal cell line or hybridoma. The level of expression of chimeric antibody should be higher when the gene is at its natural chromosomal location rather than at a random position. Detailed methods for preparation of chimeric (humanized) antibodies can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,482,856.</p>3) Intact Human Antibodies.</p>In another embodiment, this invention provides for intact, fully human anti-CD46 CPP1 (e.g., prostate cancer specific) antibodies. Such antibodies can readily be produced in a manner analogous to making chimeric human antibodies. In this instance, instead of using a recognition function derived, e.g. from a murine, the fully human recognition function (e.g., VH and V<sub>L</sub>) of the antibodies described herein is utilized.</p>4) Diabodies.</p>In certain embodiments, diabodies comprising o",
    "ained 18/18 frozen prostate cancer tissues (FIG. 6). To study expression on normal tissues, we used the FDA standard normal frozen tissue panel for therapeutic antibody evaluation (US Biomax) that contains 90 tissues cores (30 organ sites from 3 individuals). We found that most of the normal human tissues expressed very low levels of the UA20 epitope except the placental trophoblasts and prostate glands. Because the normal prostate is not a vital organ and placenta trophoblasts are not present in men, the CD46 epitope is an excellent target for developing antibody-based targeted therapy as it mediates tumor-preferred internalization as afore-described.</p>Identification of a New Anti-CD46 Human Antibody 2B10:</p>We have re-screened the laser capture microdissection (LCM)-selected prostate tumor binding antibodies by transferring the scFv genes from phage to yeast to create a yeast surface displayed human scFv library that is enriched for cell surface binding antibodies. Following two rounds of selection on live prostate tumor cells, we identified a new anti-CD46 antibody 2B10. While UA20 and 2B10 share homologies, they have a different heavy chain CDR1 sequence (FIG. 8). Nonetheless, 2B10 also bind to human CD46 and compete with UA20, indicating that they bind to the same or closely related epitope.</p>We converted both UA20 and 2B10 into human IgG1s. We found that 2B10 IgG1 has higher affinity towards prostate cancer cells. Measured on live tumor cells by FACS, the apparent KD for 2B10 is about 1-5 nM while for UA20 about 5-10 nM (FIG. 7).</p>It is understood that the examples and embodiments described herein are for illustrative purposes only and that various modifications or changes in light thereof will be suggested to persons skilled in the art and are to be included within the spirit and purview of this application and scope of the appended claims. All publications, patents, and patent applications cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes.</p>"
