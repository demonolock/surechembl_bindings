    "/p>As used herein, a substance which enhances the physiological activity of TLR7 refers to a TLR7 agonist having a TLR7 receptor agonist activity, and is not particularly limited as long as the substance enhances the function of the TLR7 receptor.</p>As used herein, a substance which enhances the physiological activity of TLR8 refers to a TLR8 agonist having a TLR8 receptor agonist activity, and is not particularly limited as long as the substance enhances the function of the TLR8 receptor.</p>As used herein, a substance which enhances the physiological activity of TLR9 refers to a TLR9 agonist having TLR9 receptor agonist activity, and is not particularly limited as long as the substance enhances the function of the TLR9 receptor.</p>Examples of the substances which enhance the physiological activity of TLR7 herein include substances which enhance the physiological activity of TLR7 or substances which enhance the physiological activity of TLR7 and TLR8.</p>The substances which enhance the physiological activity of TLR7 as used herein preferably include TLR7 selective agonists. As used herein, the term \"TLR7 selective\" means that the TLR, other than TLR7, receptor agonist activity is weaker than the TLR7 receptor agonist activity, and includes, for example, the case where the TLR7 receptor agonist activity is stronger than the TLR8 receptor agonist activity (TLR8's endogenous ligand is a single chain RNA), more specifically, the case where the TLR7 receptor agonist activity (EC 50 value) is 10 times or more of the TLR8 receptor agonist activity .</p>Examples of substances which enhance the physiological activity of TLR7 herein include low molecular weight compounds which enhance the physiological activity of TLR7, and conjugated compounds in which a low molecular weight compound(s) which enhances the physiological activity of TLR7 and a lipid(s) are chemically linked via a spacer(s).</p>Specific examples of the low molecular weight compounds which enhance the physiological activity of TLR7 herein include those having a molecular weight of 200 to 600, preferably a molecular weight of 250 to 500, and more preferably a molecular weight of 300 to 500.</p>The low molecular weight compounds which enhance the physiological activity of TLR7 herein preferably include compounds having an adenine skeleton(s), a pyrimidine skeleton(s), imidazoquinoline skeleton(s), an imidazopyridine skeleton(s), quinazoline skeleton(s), a guanine skeleton(s), or a dihydropteridine skeleton(s), and more preferably include compounds having an adenine skeleton(s), a pyrimidine skeleton(s), an imidazoquinoline skeleton(s).</p>Examples of compounds having an adenine skeleton(s) include compounds having a 4-amino-8-oxo-purine (8-oxoadenine) skeleton, such as compounds having a 4-amino-8-oxo-purine skeleton in which the 9-position is substituted with an alkyl group (for example, straight chain alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms) which may be substituted with 5 to 6 membered ar"
