    "ng &lt; 2 active channels. The maximum number of simultaneous openings determined the number of active channels during the course of an experiment. To determine the single- channel current amplitude, the data recorded from 120 sec of AF508-CFTR activity was filtered \"off-line\" at 100 Hz and then used to construct all-point amplitude histograms that were fitted with multigaussian functions using Bio-Patch Analysis software (Bio-Logic Comp. France). The total microscopic current and open probability (P<sub>0</sub>) were determined from 120 sec of channel activity. The P<sub>0</sub> was determined using the Bio-Patch software or from the relationship P<sub>0</sub> = I i(N), where I = mean current, i = single-channel current amplitude, and N = number of active channels in patch. </p>Cell Culture </p> [00862] NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing AF508-CFTR are used for excised-membrane patch-clamp recordings.

For single channel recordings, 2,500 - 5,000 cells were seeded on poly-L- lysine-coated glass coverslips and cultured for 24 - 48 hrs at 27 \u00b0C before use. </p>Activity of the Compound 1 </p> [00863] Compounds of the invention are useful as modulators of ATP binding cassette transporters.

Tsien (1997) \"Improved indicators of cell membrane potential that use fluorescence resonance energy transfer\" Chem Biol 4(4): 269-77) in combination with instrumentation for measuring fluorescence changes such as the Voltage/Ion Probe Reader (VIPR) (See, Gonzalez, J.
