    " of glutamatergic and dopaminergic inputs will enhance cognitive behavior, while suppressing or reducing unwanted behavior. Compounds of the invention may be for use in treating or ameliorating diseases or conditions in which striatal hypofunction is a prominent feature or ones in which basal ganglia dysfunction plays a role, such as, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorders, addiction and psychosis. Other conditions for which the inhibitors described herein may have a desirable and useful effect include those requiring a reduction in activity and reduced response to psychomotor stimulants or where it would be desirable to reduce conditional avoidance responses, which is often predictive of clinical antipsychotic activity.</p>The compounds of this invention may be for use in treating or ameliorating diseases or conditions in neuronal development, learning, and memory, prolactin and aldosterone secretion, bone cell differentiation, growth, and bone resorption, immunological response, vascular angiogenesis, inflammatory cell transit, cardiac contraction, platelet aggregation, female sexual arousal disorder, and hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.</p>As used herein, the term \"'selective PDE2 inhibitor\" refers to an organic molecule that effectively inhibits an enzyme from the PDE2 family to a greater extent than enzymes from the PDE 1, and 3-11 families. In one embodiment, a selective PDE2 inhibitor is an organic molecule having a Ki for inhibition of PDE2 that is less than or about one-tenth that for a substance that is an inhibitor for another PDE enzyme. In other words, the organic molecule inhibits PDE2 activity to the same degree at a concentration of about one-tenth or less than the concentration required for any other PDE enzyme. Preferably, a selective PDE2 inhibitor is an organic molecule, having a Ki for inhibition of PDE2 that is less than or about one-hundredth that for a substance that is an inhibitor for another PDE enzyme. In other words, the organic molecule inhibits PDE2 activity to the same degree at a concentration of about one-hundredth or less than the concentration required for any other PDE enzyme. Preferably, a selective PDE2 inhibitor is an organic molecule, having a Ki for inhibition of PDE2 that is less than or about five-hundredth that for a substance that is an inhibitor for another PDE enzyme. In other words, the organic molecule inhibits PDE2 activity to the same degree at a concentration of about five-hundredth or less than the concentration required for any other PDE enzyme. A \"selective PDE2 inhibitor\" can be identified, for example, by comparing the ability of an organic molecule to inhibit PDE2 activity to its ability to inhibit PDE enzymes from the other PDE families. For example, an organic molecule may be assayed for its ability to inhibit PDE2 activity, as well as PDE1A, PDE1B, PDE1C, PDE3A, PDE3B, PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C, PDE4D, PDE5A, PDE6A, PDE6B, PDE6C, PDE7A, PDE7B, PDE8A, PDE8B, PDE9A, PDE10 and/or PDE11A.</p>Phosphodiesterase enzymes including PDE2 have been implicated in a wide range of biological functions. This has suggested a potential role for these enzymes in a variety of disease processes in humans or other species. The compounds of the present invention may have utility in treating a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders.</p>In a specific embodiment, compounds of the present invention are for use in treating schizophrenia or psychosis. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) (2000, American Psychiatric Association, Washington DC) provides a diagnostic tool that includes paranoid, disorganized, catatonic or undifferentiated schizophrenia and substance-induced psychotic dis",
    "OPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to standard protocol. A consensus sequence was developed from multiple clones and then deposited into GenBank (EU812167). AD293 cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with 70-80% confluency were transiently transfected with rhesus PDE2A3 / pcDNA3.3-TOPO using Lipofectamine 2000 according to manufacturer specifications (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were harvested 48 hours post-transfection and lysed by sonication (setting 3, 10 X 5 sec pulses) in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA and Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablets (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Lysate was collected by centrifugation at 75,000 x g for 20 minutes at 4\u00b0C and supernatant utilized for evaluation of PDE2 activity. The fluorescence polarization assay for cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases was performed using an IMAP\u00ae FP kit supplied by Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA (product # R8139). IMAP\u00ae technology has been applied previously to examine the effects of phosphodiesterase inhibitors (Huang, W., et al., J. Biomol Screen, 2002, 7: 215). Assays were performed at room temperature in 384-well microtiter plates with an incubation volume of 20.2 \u00b5L. Solutions of test compounds were prepared in DMSO and serially diluted with DMSO to yield 8 \u00b5L of each of 10 solutions differing by 3-fold in concentration, at 32 serial dilutions per plate. 100% inhibition is determined using a known PDE2 inhibitor, which can be any compound that is present at 5,000 times its Ki value in the assay described below, such as Bay 60-7550 (Ki-\u223c0.2nM) at 1 \u00b5M concentration for 100% inhibition. Bay 60-7550 was obtained from Axxora via Fisher Scientific (cat# ALX-270-421-M025 / cat# NC9314773). Put another way, any compound with Ki of \u223c0.2 to about 2nM could be used at 1 to 10 \u00b5M. 0% of inhibition is determined by using DMSO (1% final concentrations).</p>A Labcyte Echo 555 (Labcyte, Sunnyvale, CA) is used to dispense 200 nL from each well of the titration plate to the 384 well assay plate. Ten microliters of a solution of enzyme (1/2000 final dilution from aliquots; sufficient to produce 20% substrate conversion) was added to the assay plate. Next 10 uL of a separate solution of the substrate FAM-labeled cAMP (50 nM final concentration product # R7506 from Molecular Devices) and the activator cGMP (1 uM final concentration), prepared in the assay buffer (10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.2, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.05% NaN<sub>3</sub> 0.01% Tween-20, and 1 mM DTT) was added to the assay plate and shaken to mix. The reaction is allowed to proceed at room temperature for 60 minutes. A binding solution is then made from the kit components, comprised of 80% Solution A, 20% Solution B and binding reagent at a volume of 1/600 the total binding solution. The enzymatic reaction is stopped by addition of 60 \u00b5L of the binding solution to each well of the assay plates and the plates are sealed and shaken for 30 seconds. The plate was incubated at room temperature for at least one hour prior to determining the fluorescence polarization (FP). The parallel and perpendicular fluorescence of each well of the plate was measured using a Tecan Genios Pro plate reader (Tecan, Switzerland) or Perkin Elmer EnVision\u2122 plate reader (Waltham, MA). Fluorescence polarization (mP) was calculated from the parallel (S) and perpendicular (P) fluorescence of each sample well and the analogous values for the median control well, containing only substrate (So and Po), using the following equation:\nPolarization (mP) = 1000<sup>\u2217</sup>(S/So-P/Po)/(S/So+P/Po).</p>Dose-inhibition profiles for each compound were characterized by fitting the mP data to a four-parameter equation given below. The apparent inhibition constant (K<sub>I</sub>), the maximum inhibition at the low plateau relative to \"100% Inhibition Control\" (Imax; e.g. 1=&gt; same as this control), the minimum inhibition at the high plateau relative to the \"0% Inhibition Control\" (Imin, e.g. 0=&gt; same as the no drug control) and the Hill slope (nH) are determined by a non-linear least squares fitting of the mP values as a function of dose of the compound using an in-house software based on the procedures described by Mosser et al., JALA, 2003, 8: 54-63, using the following equation: mP=0%mP\u2212100%mPImax\u2212Imin1+Drug(10\u2212pKI1+SubstrateKMnH+100\u2062%\u2062mP+0%mP\u2212100%mP1\u2212Imax<img id=\"ib0593\" path=\"imgb0593.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/725504110/EP/20200513/B1/000003/08/70/60/imgb0593.tif\"/></p>The median signal of the \"0% inhibition controls\" (0%mP) and the median signal of the \"100% inhibition controls\" (100%mP) are constants determined from the controls located in columns 1-2 and 23-24 of each assay plate. An apparent (K<sub>M</sub>) for FAM-labeled cAMP of \u223c10 uM was used.</p>Selectivity for PDE2, as compared to other PDE families, was assessed using the IMAP\u00ae technology. Human PDE10A2 enzyme was prepared from cytosolic fractions of transiently transfected HEK cells. All other PDE's were GST Tag human enzyme expressed in insect cells and were obtained from BPS Bioscience (San Diego, CA): PDE1A (Cat# 60010), human PDE2A1(Cat# 60020), PDE3A (Cat# 60030), PDE4A1A (Cat# 60040), PDE5A1 (Cat# 60050), PDE",
    " assay plates in two consecutive additions of 10 \u00b5L and then shaken to mix. The reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 60 minutes. A binding solution was then made from the kit components, comprised of 80% Solution A, 20% Solution B and binding reagent at a volume of 1/600 the total binding solution. The enzymatic reaction was stopped by addition of 60 \u00b5L of the binding solution to each well of the assay plate. The plates were sealed and shaken for 10 seconds. The plates were incubated at room temperature for one hour, then the parallel and perpendicular fluorescence was measured using a Tecan Genios Pro plate reader (Tecan, Switzerland). The apparent inhibition constants for the compounds against all 11 PDE's was determined from the parallel and perpendicular fluorescent readings as described for PDE10 FP assay using the following apparent K<sub>M</sub> values for each enzyme and substrate combination: PDE1A (FAM cGMP) 70 nM, human PDE2A1 (FAM cAMP) 10,000 nM, PDE3A (FAM cAMP) 50 nM, PDE4A1A (FAM cAMP) 1500 nM, PDE5A1 (FAM cGMP) 400 nM, PDE6C (FAM cGMP) 700 nM, PDE7A (FAM cAMP) 150 nM, PDE8A1 (FAM cAMP) 50 nM, PDE9A2 (FAM cGMP) 60 nM, PDE10A2 (FAM cAMP) 150nM, PDE11A4 (FAM cAMP) 1000 nM. The intrinsic PDE2 inhibitory activity of a compound which may be used in accordance with the present invention may be determined by these assays.</p>The compounds of the following examples had activity in inhibiting the human PDE2 enzyme in the aforementioned assays with a Ki of less than about 50 \u00b5M. Many of compounds within the present invention had activity in inhibiting the human PDE2 enzyme in the aforementioned assays, with a Ki of less than about 1 \u00b5M, preferably less than or about 0.1 \u00b5M. Additional data is provided in the following Examples. Such a result is indicative of the intrinsic activity of the compounds in use as inhibitors of the PDE2 enzyme. In general, one of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that a substance is considered to effectively inhibit PDE2 activity if it has a Ki of less than or about 1 \u00b5M, preferably less than or about 0.1 \u00b5M. The present invention also includes compounds within the generic scope of the invention which possess activity as inhibitors of other phosphodiesterase enzymes.</p>In the following tables representative data for the compounds of the invention as PDE2 inhibitors as determined by the foregoing assays and as conducted in laboratory (Lab) A or B are shown. The PDE2 Ki is a measure of the ability of the test compound to inhibit the action of the PDE2 enzyme.\nTable 18.
