    " active antibody is advantageous for crossing the BBB and remaining in the brain ECF. The low affinity to the BBB-R at the brain side lowers the rate (or removes) the conditionally active antibody is transported back across the BBB out of the brain and back into the blood relative to the template antibody. </p> [000258] In some other embodiments, the present invention provides a method for evolving a DNA that encodes a template antibody against a BBB-R to create a mutant DNA library. The mutant DNA library is then expressed to obtain mutant antibodies. The mutant antibodies are screened for a conditionally active antibody that binds to the BBB-R under at least one blood plasma physiological condition and little or no affinity to the BBB-R under at least one brain physiological condition. Thus, the selected mutant antibody has affinity to the BBB-R at the plasma side and little or no affinity to the BBB-R at the brain ECF side. This selected mutant antibody is a conditionally active antibody. </p> [000259] Such a conditionally active antibody is advantageous in crossing the BBB and remaining in the brain ECF. After binding to the BBB-R at the blood plasma side, the conditionally active antibody is transported across the BBB, and the little to no affinity to the BBB-R at the brain ECF side means that the conditionally active antibody is unlikely to be transported out of the brain. </p> [000260] The affinity of the conditionally active antibody to a BBB-R may be measured by its half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), which is a measure of how much of the antibody is needed to inhibit the binding of a known BBB-R ligand to the BBB-R by 50%. A common approach is to perform a competitive binding assay, such as competitive ELISA assy. An exemplary competitive ELISA assay to measure IC50 on TfR (a BBB-R) is one in which \n\n increasing concentrations of anti-TfR antibody compete against biotinylated TfR<sup>A</sup> for binding to TfR. The anti-TfR antibody competitive ELISA may be performed in Maxisorp plates (Neptune, NJ.) coated with 2.5 pg/ml of purified murine TfR extracellular domain in PBS at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Plates are washed with PBS/0.05% Tween 20 and blocked using Superblock blocking buffer in PBS (Thermo Scientific, Hudson, N.H.). A titration of each individual anti-TfR antibody (1:3 serial dilution) is combined with biotinylated anti-TfR<sup>A</sup> (0.5 nM final </p>concentration) and added to the plate for 1 hour at room temperature. Plates are washed with PBS/0.05 % Tween 20, and HRP-streptavidin (Southern Biotech, Birmingham) is added to the plate and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Plates are washed with PBS/0.05% Tween 20, and biotinylated anti-TfR<sup>A</sup> bound to the plate is detected using TMB substrate (BioFX Laboratories, O wings Mills). </p> [000261] A high IC50 indicates that more of the conditionally active antibody is required to inhibit binding of the known ligand of a BBB-R, and thus that the antibody's affinity for that BBB-R is relatively low. Conversely, a low IC50 indicates that less of the conditionally active antibody is required to inhibit binding of the known ligand, and thus that the antibody's affinity for that BBB-R is relatively high. </p> [000262] In some embodiments, the IC50 of the conditionally active antibodies from a BBB-R in the blood plasma may be from about 1 nM to about 100 mM, or from about 5 nM to about 100 pM, or from about 50 nM to about 100 pM, or from about 100 nM to about 100 pM, or from about 5 nM to about 10 pM, or from about 30 nM to about 1 pM, or from about 50 nM to about 1 pM. </p>CONDITIONALLY ACTIVE BIOLOGIC PROTEINS FOR SYNOVIAL FLUID </p>[000263] Joint diseases are a major cause of disability and early retirement in the industrialized countries. Joint diseases often lead to damage at a joint which is difficult to repair. Synovial fluid is a body fluid that is found in the synovial cavity of the joints (e.g., knee, hip, shoulder) of a human or animal body between the cartilage and synovium of facing articulating surfaces. Synovial fluid provides nourishment to the cartilage and also serves as a lubricant for the joints. The cells of the cartilage and synovium secrete fluid that serve as a lubricant between the articulating surfaces. Human synovial fluid includes approximately 85% water. It is derived from the dialysate of blood plasma, which itself is made up of water, dissolved proteins, glucose, clotting factors, mineral ions, hormones, etc. Proteins such as albumin and globulins are present in synovial fluid and are believed to play an important role in the lubricating the joint area. \n\n Some other proteins are also found in human synovial fluid, including the glycoproteins such as alpha-l-acid glycoprotein (AGP), a"
