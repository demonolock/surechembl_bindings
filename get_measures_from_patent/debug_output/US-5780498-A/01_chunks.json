The granules are dried, and the remainder of the corn starch, the talc and the calcium stearate are added and mixed with the granules. The mixture is compressed to give tablets (weight: 280 mg) and these are coated with a solution of the hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and the shellac in dichloromethane (final weight of the coated tablet: 283 mg).</p>Example 123Tablets and coated tablets containing another compound of the formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of the formula I, for example as in one of Examples 1 to 120, can also be prepared in an analogous manner to that described in Examples 121 and 122.</p>Pharmacological Experiments</p>Endothelin (ET) receptor binding assay</p>The binding affinity to the ET receptor of the compounds of the present invention is determined according to the method described below (published in Takai et. al (1992) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 184, 953-959). ET-1 and ET-3 are purchased from Peptide Institute Inc. (Osaka, Japan),  <sup>125</sup> I!ET-1 and  <sup>125</sup> I!ET-3 (\u02dc74 TBq/mmol each) are purchased from Amersham International (Bucks, U.K.).</p>The plasma membrane of porcine lung (2 \u03bcg of protein) is incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 hour with 30 pM  <sup>125</sup> I!ET-1 or 10 pM  <sup>125</sup> I!ET-3 in the absence or presence of various amounts of nonlabeled ligands in a total volume of 1 ml of 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), containing 145 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.2 mg/ml bacitracin. After the incubation, unbound  <sup>125</sup> I!ETs are separated by centrifugation at 20,000\u00d7g for 20 min at 4\u00b0 C. followed by aspiration of the supernatant. The radioactivity in the membrane pellet is measured in Wallac-1470 Wizard autogamma counter (Pharmacia). Nonspecific binding is defined as membrane-associated radioactivity in the presence of saturating concentrations of ETs (100 nM). Nonspecific binding is subtracted from the total binding and the difference is defined as specific binding. Total binding is always less than 15% of the total radioactivity added.</p>The binding to the ET<sub>A</sub> receptor is determined with  <sup>125</sup> I!ET-1 in the presence of 1 nM nonlabeled ET-3 and the binding to the ET<sub>B</sub> receptor with  <sup>125</sup> I!ET-3 alone. By Scatchard analysis, the ET<sub>A</sub> receptor shows an apparant dissociation constant (Kd) of 44 pM and maximum binding sites (Bmax) of 342 fmol/mg protein, while the ET<sub>B</sub> receptor has a Kd of 8 pM and Bmax of 362 fmol/mg protein. From the inhibition curves for the binding of  <sup>125</sup> I!ETs, the apparant binding affinity constant (Ki) of one of the test compounds (example 55) is calculated as a parameter of the affinity for the ET<sub>A</sub> and ET<sub>B</sub> receptors.</p>The following table shows the results of the binding assay as % inhibition of the specific ET<sub>A</sub> and ET<sub>B</sub> receptor binding by respectively 10<sup>-5</sup> M and 10<sup>-7</sup> M of the test compounds:</p>______________________________________                                    \n% Inhibition of the Binding to                                            \n                      K.sub.i (ET.sub.A)                                  \n                               K.sub.i (ET.sub.B)                         \nExample                                                                   \n       ET.sub.A -Receptor                                                 \n                  ET.sub.B -Receptor                                      \n                               nM!    nM!                                 \n______________________________________                                    \n 1     37         55                                                      \n 4     74         93                                                      \n 7     77         87                                                      \n12     36         91                                                      \n55     94         100         440    1                                    \n57     34         95                                                      \n65     47         59                                                      \n84     46         70                                                      \n91     100        100         54     0.23     "
