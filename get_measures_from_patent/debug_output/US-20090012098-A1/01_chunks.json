    "appropriately depending on the method of administration, the patient's age, sex and other factors, severity of the disease and other factors. Generally, however, the daily dose of the active ingredient compound is preferably within the range of about 0.0001 to about 50 mg per kilogram of body weight. It is desirable that the active ingredient compound be contained in each unit dosage form in an amount of about 0.001 to about 1,000 mg, particularly 0.01 to 100 mg, more particularly 0.1 to 50 mg, yet more particularly 1 mg to 20 mg.</p>Pharmacological Tests1. Materials and Methods1.1 Test Compound</p>7-{4-[4-(2,3-Dichlorophenyl)-1-piperazinyl]-butoxy}-3,4-dihydrocarbostyril (aripiprazole) was used as test compound.</p>1.2 Reference Compounds</p>Serotonin (5-HT) and WAY-100635 (N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridimyl)-cyclohexanecarboxamide, a 5-HT<sub>1A </sub>receptor antagonist, manufactured by RBI (Natick, Mass.) were used as reference compounds.</p>1.3 Vehicle</p>Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) manufactured by Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, Mo.) was used as vehicle.</p>1.4 Preparation of Test and Reference Compounds</p>Test compound was dissolved in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to yield 100 \u03bcM stock solutions (final concentration of DMSO in all tubes containing test compound was 1%, v/v). All other reference compounds were prepared by the same method using double-distilled water rather than DMSO.</p>1.5 Experimental Procedure for the [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP\u03b3S Binding Assay</p>Test and reference compounds were studied in triplicate at 10 different concentrations (0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 1000, 10000 and 50000 nM) for their effects upon basal [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP\u03b3S binding to h5-HT<sub>1A </sub>CHO cell membranes. Reactions were performed in 5 ml glass test tubes containing 8 \u03bcl of test/reference drug mixed with 792 \u03bcl of buffer (25 mM Tris HCl, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM EGTA, pH=7.4) containing GDP (1 \u03bcM), [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP\u03b3S (0.1 nM) and h5-HT<sub>1A </sub>CHO cell membranes (10 \u03bcg protein/reaction; NEN Life Science Products, Boston, Mass.; catalog #CRM035, lot #501-60024, GenBank #X13556). Reactions proceeded for 60 min at room temperature and were terminated by rapid filtration through Whatman GF/B filter paper, using a Brandel harvester and 4\u00d73 ml ice-cold buffer washes. <sup>35</sup>S radio-activity bound to the filter paper was measured using liquid scintillation counting (1272 Clinigamma, LKB/Wallach).</p>1.6 Experimental Procedure to Determine the Binding Affinity of Test compound (Aripiprazole) at the h5-HT<sub>1A </sub>Receptor</p>Test compound was studied in triplicate at 10 different concentrations (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000 and 10000 nM) to determine its displacement of [<sup>3</sup>H] 8-OH-DPAT (1 nM; NEN Life Sciences; catalog #NET 929, lot #3406035, Specific Activity=124.9 Ci/mmol) binding to h5-HT<sub>1A </sub>receptors in CHO cell membranes (15-20 \u03bcg protein; NEN Life Science",
    "CRM035, lot #501-60024). Membranes (396 \u03bcl) were incubated in 5 ml glass tubes containing [<sup>3</sup>H] 8-OH-DPAT (396 \u03bcl), test compound or vehicle (8 \u03bcl) and buffer A (50 mM Tris.HCl, 10 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) ascorbic acid, pH=7.4). All assays proceeded for 60 min at room temperature and were terminated by rapid filtration through Whatman GF/B filter paper (presoaked in buffer B; 50 mM Tris.HCl, pH=7.4), using a Brandel harvester and 4\u00d71 ml ice-cold washes with buffer B. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 10 \u03bcM (+) 8-OH-DPAT.</p>1.7 Parameters Determined</p>Serotonin (5-HT) is a full 5-HT<sub>1A </sub>receptor agonist which stimulates increases in basal [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP\u03b3S binding to h5-HT<sub>1A </sub>receptors in recombinant CHO cell membranes. Test compound was studied at 10 concentrations to determine their effects upon basal [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP\u03b3S binding relative to that produced by 10 \u03bcM 5-HT. The relative potency (EC<sub>50</sub>, 95% confidence interval) and intrinsic agonist activity (% of E<sub>max </sub>for 10 \u03bcM 5-HT) was calculated for each compound by computerized non-linear regression analysis of complete concentration-effect data. The binding affinity of test compound at the h5-HT<sub>1A </sub>receptor was determined by its ability to prevent [<sup>3</sup>H] 8-OH-DPAT binding to CHO cell membranes that express this receptor. Non-linear regression analysis of the competition binding data was used to calculate an inhibition constant (IC<sub>50</sub>, 95% confidence interval), which is the concentration of test compound that occupies half of the h5-HT<sub>1A </sub>sites specifically bound by [<sup>3</sup>H] 8-OH-DPAT. The affinity of h5-HT<sub>1A </sub>receptors for test compound (Ki, 95% confidence interval) was calculated by the equation, Ki=(IC<sub>50</sub>)/(1+([[<sup>3</sup>H] 8-OH-DPAT]/Kd), where the Kd for [<sup>3</sup>H] 8-OH-DPAT at h5-HT<sub>1A</sub>=0.69 nM (NEN Life Sciences). All estimates of drug binding affinity, potency and intrinsic efficacy at the h5-HT<sub>1A </sub>receptor were calculated using GraphPad Prism version 3.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, Calif.).</p>2. ResultsTest compound and 5-HT produced concentration-dependent increases above basal [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP\u03b3S binding. 1% DMSO tested alone had no effect upon basal or drug-induced [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP\u03b3S binding.</p>Test compound (EC<sub>50</sub>=2.12 nM), 5-HT (EC<sub>50</sub>\u22123.67 nM), potently stimulated, basal [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP\u03b3S binding. Potency and intrinsic agonist efficacy estimates were derived by non-linear regression analysis with correlation coefficients (r<sup>2</sup>)&gt;0.98 in each case (Table 1). Test compound exerted partial agonist efficacies in the 65-70% range. WAY-100635 produced no significant change (unpaired Student's t-test) in basal [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP\u03b3S binding at all concentrations tested (Table 1). WAY-100635 did, however, completely inhibit the effects of 5-HT and test compound upon [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP\u03b3S binding to h5-HT<sub>1A </sub>receptors in CHO cell membranes (Table 2).
