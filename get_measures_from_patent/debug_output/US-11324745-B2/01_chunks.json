    "REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONSThe present application is a continuation application of U.S. application Ser. No. 17/206,823, filed Mar. 19, 2021, which is a continuation of International Application No. PCT/US2021/014742, filed Jan. 22, 2021, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional App. No. 62/965,650 (filed Jan. 24, 2020) and U.S. Provisional App. No. 63/018,182 (filed Apr. 30, 2020); the entire disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>BACKGROUNDProtein kinase inhibitors (PKIs) have been studied for their potential use in treating various disorders of cellular proliferation, including cancer. The potential for PKIs as a treatment is based on the role that protein kinases are known to play in regulating many cellular pathways, including those involved in signal transduction. Dysregulation of protein kinases has been implicated in the development and progression of many cancers, which suggests that PKIs may be useful as a treatment for disorders or diseases such as cancer that are caused by uncontrolled overexpression or upregulation of protein kinases.</p>One such PKI is dasatinib, which is currently marketed as an immediate-release formulation for oral administration under the brand name SPRYCEL. SPRYCEL is a pharmaceutical formulation of crystalline dasatinib monohydrate. SPRYCEL is indicated for the treatment of (a) adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase; (b) adult patients with chronic, accelerated, or myeloid or lymphoid blast phase Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib; (c) adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy; (d) pediatric patients one year of age and older with Ph+ CML in chronic phase; and (e) pediatric patients one year of age and older with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL in combination with chemotherapy.</p>Presently, oral dosage of SPRYCEL is known to be affected by co-administration with other drugs. For example, oral bioavailability of SPRYCEL is strongly affected when co-administered with gastric acid-reducing agents such as H<sub>2 </sub>antagonists (e.g., famotidine), proton pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole), or antacids. In particular, the prescribing information for SPRYCEL states that \u201c[t]he coadministration of SPRYCEL with a gastric acid reducing agent may decrease the concentrations of dasatinib\u201d and that \u201c[d]ecreased dasatinib concentrations may reduce efficacy.\u201d</p>The aqueous solubility of dasati"
