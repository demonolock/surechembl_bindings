    "cokinetics of Compound (I) [0083] The pharmacokinetics of Compound (I) were described using a one-compartment model with first order oral absorption. Individual bayesian estimates of Compound (I) oral clearance and steady-state volume of distribution were predicted for each patient in the same Phase III clinical trial utilizing the population parameter estimates (priors) from the Phase I population pharmacokinetic analysis. Mean concentration-time profiles (Cp) for each regimen for use in the pharmacodynamic modeling were predicted using the mean post hoc oral clearance (2.68 L/h) and Vss/F (15.4 L) values across these patients (FIG. 1). </p>Pharmacodynamics of Compound (I) [0084] A modified indirect response model IV (Dayneka et al. 1993) was developed utilizing the pharmacokinetics of Compound (I) as the driving force for the change in fasting plasma glucose after various doses of Compound (I). Modeling fittings were done using ADAPT II, Release 4 (D'Argenio and Schumitzky, 1979). </p>[0085] In the absence of Compound (I), plasma glucose levels are governed by formation (kin) and utilization (kout). The action of Compound (I) was described as stimulation (S(t)) of the utilization of plasma glucose (kout), described in text as FPG reduction (Eq. 1). S<sub>max </sub>represents the maximal stimulation, SC<sub>50 </sub>is the Compound (I) concentration associated with half-maximal stimulation and \u03b3 represents a sigmoidicity parameter in the Hill type function (Eq. 2).  \n\uf74cFPG\uf74ct=ki\ue89e\u2003\ue89en-kout\u2218S\ue8a0(t)\u2218FPG.Eq\ue89e\u2003\ue89e1where\ue89e\u2003\ue89e\n\ue89eS\ue8a0(t)=1+Smax\u2218CP\u03b3S\ue89e\u2003\ue89eC50\u03b3+CP\u03b3.\ue89e\u2003Eq\ue89e\u2003\ue89e2<img id=\"EMI-M00001\" path=\"US20040102486A1-20040527-M00001.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/21821589/US/20040527/A1/020040/10/24/86/US20040102486A1-20040527-M00001.TIF\"/>\n</p>[0086] The mean fasting plasma glucose profiles from 6 weeks prior to dosing (time 0) through 26 weeks of treatment for the 5 treatment groups are shown in FIG. 2. The PK/PD model accommodates the full nature of the fasting plasma glucose response over the duration of the study period as evidenced by the close agreement between observed and predicted fasting plasma glucose concentrations (FIG. 2). An estimated lag-time (292 hours) between the first dose and onset of response was incorporated into the modeling. The lag-time allows the model to describe the slow onset of action of Compound (I) observed over the first 4 weeks of dosing. </p>[0087] The fitted plasma glucose concentrations at steady-state reflect the difference in response to varying total daily dose as well as different dosing frequencies (i.e. once vs twice daily) (FIG. 2).
