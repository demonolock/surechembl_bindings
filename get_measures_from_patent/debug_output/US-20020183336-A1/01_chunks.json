The compounds of the invention may be resolved into their enantiomers by conventional methods or, preferably, the individual enantiomers may be prepared directly by substitution of (2R)-(\u2212)-glycidyl 3-nitrobenzenesulfonate or tosylate (for the S benzodioxan methanamine) or (2S)-(+)-glycidyl 3-nitrobenzenesulfonate or tosylate (for the R enantiomer) in place of epihalohydrin or racemic glycidyl tosylate in the procedures above. </p>[0050] The 5-HT<sub>1A </sub>affinity of compounds of this invention was established in accordance with standard pharmaceutically accepted test procedures with representative compounds as follows. </p>[0051] High affinity for the serotonin 5-HT<sub>1A </sub>receptor was established by testing the claimed compound's ability to displace [<sup>3</sup>H] 8-OH-DPAT (dipropylaminotetralin) from the 5-HT<sub>1A </sub>serotonin receptor following a modification of the procedure of Hall et. al., J. Neurochem. 44, 1685 (1985) which utilizes CHO cells stably transfected with human 5-HT<sub>1A </sub>receptors. The 5-HT<sub>1A </sub>affinities for the compounds of the invention are reported below as K<sub>i</sub>'s. </p>[0052] Antagonist activity at 5-HT<sub>1A </sub>receptors was established by using a <sup>35</sup>S-GTP \u03b3S binding assay similar to that used by Lazareno and Birdsall (Br. J. Pharmacol. 109: 1120, 1993), in which the test compound's ability to affect the binding of <sup>3</sup>S-GTP\u03b3S to membranes containing cloned human 5-HT<sub>1A </sub>receptors was determined. Agonists produce an increase in binding whereas antagonists produce no increase but rather reverse the effects of the standard agonist 8-OH-DPAT. The test compound's maximum inhibitory effect is represented as the I<sub>max</sub>, while its potency is defined by the IC<sub>50</sub>. </p>[0053] The results of the two standard experimental test procedures described in the preceding two paragraphs were as follows:  \n5-HT<sub>1A </sub>Receptor Affinity5-HT<sub>1A </sub>FunctionCompoundKI (nM)IC<sub>50 </sub>(nM) (I<sub>max</sub>)Example 10.5453.0 (76%)Example 20.77\u2014Example 33.7127.0 (95%)\n</p>[0054] The compounds of this invention have potent affinity for and antagonist activity at brain 5-HT<sub>1A </sub>serotonin receptors. The compounds of the invention are thus exceedingly interesting for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction such as is associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) Alzheimer's disease and other dementias including Lewy Body, vascular, and post stroke dementias. Cognitive dysfunction associated with surgical procedures, traumatic brain injury or stroke may also be treated in accordance with the present invention. Further, compounds of the present invention may be useful for the treatment of diseases in"
