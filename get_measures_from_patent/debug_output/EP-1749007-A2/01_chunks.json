SPA linkages provide for linkage to free amine groups on the IFN-a polypeptide.</p>[0549] For example, a PEG molecule is covalently attached via a linkage that comprises an amide bond between a propionyl group of the PEG moiety and the epsilon amino group of a surface-exposed lysine residue in the TFN-a polypeptide. Such a bond may be formed, e.g., by condensation of an a-methoxy, omega propanoic acid activated ester of PEG (mPEGspa). \n\n [U% <sup>'</sup>6f '\" <sup>\"'</sup>\"<sup>'</sup>' As<sup>'\"</sup>\" one noh-\u03caimiting example, one monopegylated CIFN conjugate preferred for use herein has a linear PEG moiety of about 30 kD attached via a covalent linkage to the CIFN polypeptide, where the covalent linkage is an amide bond between a propionyl group of the PEG moiety and the epsilon amino group of a surface-exposed lysine residue in the CIFN polypeptide, where the surface-exposed lysine residue is chosen from lys<sup>31</sup>, lys<sup>50</sup>, lys<sup>71</sup>, lys<sup>84</sup>, lys<sup>121</sup>, lys<sup>122</sup>, lys<sup>134</sup>, lys<sup>135</sup>, and lys<sup>165</sup>, and the amide bond is formed by condensation of an a-methoxy, omega propanoic acid activated ester of PEG.

For example, where the PEG-IFN-a conjugate is a monoPEGylated IFN-a, the products are first separated by ion exchange chromatography to obtain material having a charge characteristic of monoPEGylated material (other multi-PEGylated material having the same apparent charge may be present), and then the monoPEGylated materials are separated using size exclusion chromatography.
