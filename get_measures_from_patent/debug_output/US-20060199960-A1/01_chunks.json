    "re performed for 1 h at 4\u00b0 C. </p> At the end of the incubation, membranes were filtered onto unifilter (96-well white microplate with bonded GF/C filter preincubated 1 h in 0.1% PEI in wash buffer, Packard Bio-Science, Meriden, Conn.) with a Filtermate 96 harvester (Packard BioScience) and washed 3 times with cold 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 buffer. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 10 \u03bcM MPEP. The radioactivity on the filter was counted (3 min) on a Packard Top-count microplate scintillation counter with quenching correction after addition of 45 \u03bcl of microscint 40 (Canberra Packard S. A., Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland) and shaking for 20 min. </p> For functional assays, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i measurements were performed as described previously by Porter et al. [Br. J. Pharmacol. 128:13-20 (1999)] on recombinant human mGlu 5a receptors in HEK-293 cells. The cells were dye loaded using Fluo 4-AM (obtainable by FLUKA, 0.2 \u03bcM final concentration). [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i measurements were performed using :a fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR, Molecular Devices Corporation, La Jolla, Calif., USA). Antagonist evaluation was performed following a 5 min preincubation with the test compounds followed by the addition of a submaximal addition of agonist. </p> The inhibition (antagonists) curves were fitted with a four parameter logistic equation giving IC<sub>50</sub>, and Hill coefficient using iterative non linear curve fitting software (Xcel fit). </p> For binding experiments the Ki values of the compounds tested are given. The Ki value is defined by the following formula: \n\nK<sub>i</sub>=IC<sub>50</sub>/[1+L/K<sub>d</sub>]\n\n in which the IC<sub>50 </sub>values are those concentrations of the compounds tested which cause 50% inhibition of the competing radioligand ([<sup>3</sup>H]MPEP). L is the concentration of radioligand used in the binding experiment and the K<sub>d </sub>value of the radioligand is empirically determined for each batch of membranes prepared. \n</p> The compounds of the present invention are mGluR 5a receptor antagonists. The activities of compounds of formula I as measured in the assay described above are in the range of K<sub>i</sub>&lt;4 \u03bcM and preferably &lt;150 nM.  \nKi (mGluR5)Ex.[nM]23044282114281627187822665182545560367921096571031410656\n</p> The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions containing compounds of the invention or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Such pharmaceutical compositions can be in the form of tablets, coated tablets, drag\u00e9es, hard and soft gelatin capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. The pharmaceutical compositions also can be in the form of suppositories or injectable solutions. </p> The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention, in addition to one or more compounds of the invention, contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts and the like can be used, for example, as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, drag\u00e9es and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like; depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are, however, usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose and the like. Adjuvants, such as alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils and the like, can be used for aqueous inj"
