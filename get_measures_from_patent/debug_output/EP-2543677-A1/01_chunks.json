    "petes for binding to A3 domain of human von Willebrand factor with the antibody obtainable from hybridoma deposited as CNCM-1-4484.</p>Epitope binning can be used to identify antibodies that fall within the scope of the claimed invention. Epitope binning refers to the use of competitive binding assays to identity pairs of antibodies that are, or are not, capable of binding HER3 simultaneously, thereby identifying pairs of antibodies that bind to the same or overlapping epitopes on HER3. Epitope binning experiments provide evidence that antigenically distinct epitopes are present. Competition for binding can be evaluated for any pair of antibodies or fragments. For example, using the appropriate detection reagents, the binding specificity of antibodies or binding fragments from any source can be compared to the binding specificity of the monoclonal antibodies disclosed herein. Epitope binning can be performed with \"isolated antibodies\" or with cell culture supernatants. Frequently, binning is performed with first round clonal supernatants to guide the choice of clones to be developed further. The antibodies to be compared should be substantially homogeneous antigen binding domains. In the case of \"bispecific\" or \"bifunctional\" antibodies the binding specificity of the two different binding sites need to be evaluated or binned independently.</p>The antibodies of the present invention may be assayed for specific binding by any method known in the art. Many different competitive binding assay format(s) can be used for epitope binning. The immunoassays which can be used include, but are not limited to, competitive assay systems using techniques such western blots, radioimmunoassays, ELISA, \"sandwich\" immunoassays, immunoprecipitation assays, precipitin assays, gel diffusion precipitin assays, immunoradiometric assays, fluorescent immunoassays, protein A immunoassays, and complement-fixation assays. Such assays are routine and well known in the art (see, e.g., Ausubel et al., eds, 1994 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley &amp; sons, Inc., New York). For example, the BIACORE\u00ae (GE Healthcare, Piscaataway, NJ) is one of a variety of surface plasmon resonance assay formats that are routinely used to epitope bin panels of monoclonal antibodies. Additionally, routine cross-blocking assays such as those described in Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane, 1988, can be performed.</p>Methods of producing antibodies of the invention:The antibodies of the invention may be produced by any technique known in the art, such as, without limitation, any chemical, biological, genetic or enzymatic technique, either alone or in combination.</p>Knowing the amino acid sequence of the desired sequence, one skilled in the art can readily produce said antibodies, by standard techniques for production of polypeptides. For instance, they can be synthesized using well-known solid phase method, preferably usi"
