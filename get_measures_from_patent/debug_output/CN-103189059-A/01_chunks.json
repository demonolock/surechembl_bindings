    "1000 \u03bc M or a series of 4 times of dilutions (250 \u03bc M, 62.5 \u03bc M etc.) or temozolomide.Handle after 72 hours, from each hole, siphon away 100 \u03bc l culture fluid, add the MTT reagent of 10 \u03bc l in each hole.The culture dish plate adds 100 \u03bc l detergents then in 37 \u2103 of cultivations 4 hours.This plate is placed in the dark under room temperature and is spent the night, and counts with SoftMax Pro (Molecular Decives company, 5.2 versions) plate count device.</p>Absorbance data is analyzed as follows: absorbance is converted to reference to percentage ratio and to using the IC that SoftMax Pro (Molecular Devices company, 5.2 versions) computed in software goes out\n        <sub>50</sub>Reagent concentration is drawn.Earlier porose numerical value is deducted the blank plate signal averaging to calculate it with reference to percentage ratio.Be to multiply by 100 again and get divided by no drug treating blank (cell adds 11 groups of numerical value of medium contrast) mean light absorbency value by the absorbance of each instrument connection with reference to percent value.Obtain IC with 4 yuan of equations\n        <sub>50</sub>Other parameters of value and description S type dose-effect curve come the graphic analysis compound concentration to the relation of reference percentage ratio.\n      </p>By estimating the IC of test agent with 4 following parameter Rogers base of a fruit equation (logistic equation) curve fitting data\n        <sub>50</sub>Value.\n      </p>Y=Top-Bottom1+(X/IC50)n+Bottom</p>Here \" Top \" refers to maximum with reference to absorbance percentage ratio (100%), and \" Bottom \" refers at the highest reagent concentration (dropping to 0) minimum with reference to absorbance percentage ratio down, and Y refers to that with reference to absorbance percentage ratio X refers to test agent concentration, IC\n        <sub>50</sub>Reagent concentration when referring to contrast with reference to 50% growth of cell inhibition cell, n refers to the slope of curve.Trans-[two (1H-indazole) rutheniums (III) of tetrachloro] sodium (\" test medicine \") IC in human melanoma cell strain G361\n        <sub>50</sub>Value is 41 \u03bc M (Fig. 1).The temozolomide's drug resistance of the cell strain G361 (IC of the corresponding G361 cell strain of temozolomide\n        <sub>50</sub>Value is 199 \u03bc M) (Fig. 2).\n      </p>Trans-[two (1H-indazole) rutheniums (III) of tetrachloro] sodium IC in human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549\n        <sub>50</sub>Value is 9.9 \u03bc M, compares the IC of other cell strain\n        <sub>50</sub>Be worth more efficient.Obtain trans-[two (1H-indazole) rutheniums (III) of tetrachloro] sodium and paclitaxel IC in another human lung adenocarcinoma cell line H1975 with above-described same way as\n        <sub>50</sub>Value.Paclitaxel is efficient more (IC for H1975\n        <sub>50</sub>Value is 0.005 \u03bc M), by contrast, there is drug resistance (IC in the A549 cell strain to paclitaxel\n        <sub>50</sub>Value is 9.92 \u03bc M).Two kinds of v"
