    "arcinogenic factors include aflatoxin, HBV (Hepatitis B Virus) and HPV (Human Papilloma Virus). HBV has a direct relationship with hepatoma. HPV has a direct relationship with cervical cancer. According to the timing that the chemoprevention is practiced, the chemopreventions may be classified into the primary chemoprevention for the initial stage of cancer and the secondary chemoprevention for the patients having suffered from cancer and having be treated appropriately. For example, Vit A retinyl palmitate and ADT (5-[p-Methoxyphenyl]-1,2-dithiole-3-thione) are used to treat lung cancer; retinoic acid is used to treat head-neck cancer; Tamoxifen is used to treat breast cancer; Sulindac is used to treat colon cancer. Self-carefulness in public health and sexual safety is very useful in preventing cancers induced by biological agents. Besides, vaccination can effectively promote the immunity against the biologically-induced cancers. For example, HPV vaccine can protect a specified gender from HPV infection; HBV vaccine can interrupt the process of hepatitis B-hepatic cirrhosis-hepatic cancer.</p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe primary objective of the present invention is to provide chemoprevention and chemotherapy for cell hyperplasia, wherein the chemoprevention of cell hyperplasia in the present invention is referred to using a natural, synthesized or biochemically synthesized drug to reverse, suppress, or prevent oncogenesis (Refer to Anne S. Tsao, MD; Edward S. Kim, MD; Waun Ki Hong, MD; CA Cancer J Clin 2004; 54: 150-180).</p>To achieve the abovementioned objective, the present invention proposes a polypeptide for preventing and treating cell hyperplasia, which is an amino acid sequence listed as SEQ ID NO: 1.</p>The polypeptide of the present invention contains the amino acid sequence listed as SEQ ID NO: 2 and the amino acid sequence listed as SEQ ID NO: 3, which may be mathematically expressed by AM1+AM2+AM4+AM3, wherein AM1, AM2 and AM3 have the same amino acid sequence listed as SEQ ID NO: 2 and AM4 has the amino acid sequence listed as SEQ ID NO: 3. In the polypeptide of the present invention, three amino acid fragments of AM 4 are used to connect (AM1+AM2) and AM3 (Note: AM1, AM2 and AM3 may respectively have different compositions). The present invention adopts AM1, AM2 and AM3 of an identical composition so as to form a section able to bond with the compounds on the surface of cancer cells (most of them are heparin sulfates). The section is in form of [EKKWKV] that matches a mode of [XBBXBX] for bonding with heparin sulfates, wherein B denotes a basic amino acid and X denotes an arbitrary one of other amino acids (Refer to I. Capila and R. J. Linhardt, Heparin-protein interactions, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed Engl. 2002; 41: 391). Such a design makes the polypeptide of the present invention have greater affinity and increases the total charges to as high as +12. The high positive charge number greatly increases the capability of the polypeptid"
