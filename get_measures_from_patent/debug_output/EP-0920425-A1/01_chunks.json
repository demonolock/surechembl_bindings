Among the tachykinin receptors, the Ki, NK<sub>2</sub>, and NK<sub>3</sub> receptors are defined by the preferred binding affinity of substance P, neurokinin A (NKA) , and neurokinin B (NKB), respectively.</p>\n  The use of tachykinin antagonists is indicated as therapy for a variety of tachykinin-mediated diseases and conditions, including: hypersensitivity reactions; adverse immunological reactions; asthma; bronchitis; allergic rhinitis, including seasonal rhinitis and sinusitis; allergies; contact dermatitis; atopic dermatitis; inflammatory bowel diseases, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis; and emesis.</p>\n  It is understood that tachykinin-mediated diseases and conditions are those diseases and conditions in which the tachykinins are involved, either in whole or in part, in their clinical manifestation(s) . Moreover, the tachykinins involvement is not necessarily causative of a particular tachykinin-mediated disease and condition. Tachykinin antagonists are useful in controlling or providing therapeutic relief of those tachykinin-mediated diseases and conditions.</p>\n  The present invention provides new and useful tachykinin antagonists of formula (1) or stereoisomers or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.</p>\n  In a further embodiment, as tachykinin antagonists the present invention provides a method of treating tachykinin- mediated diseases and conditions, including: hypersensitivity reactions; adverse immunological reactions; asthma; bronchitis; allergic rhinitis, including \n\nseasona",

The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic.</p>\n  EXAMPLE A Antagonism of [3H]-pyrilamine binding to histamine Hi receptors by putative antagonists</p>\n  One skilled in the art can measure the Hi receptor affinity of proposed histamine antagonists as evaluated in rat brains or Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the human histamine Hi receptor gene (CHOpcDNA3HlR cells). For the studies in rat brain, young male rats are sacrificed by decapitation and the brains are immediately removed. The cortici are dissected and used immediately or stored at -20\u00b0C. For the studies in Chinese hamster ovary cells, confluent cells are freshly scraped from culture flasks. The tissues or cells are homogenized with a Polytron (setting no. 6 for 15 seconds) in 20 mL of 50 mM potassium sodium phosphate (pH 7.4, at 4\u00b0C) . The homogenate is centrifuged at 48,000 x g for 12 minutes at 4\u00b0C. The pellet is resuspended using a Polytron (setting no. 6 for 15 seconds) in incubation buffer (50 mM potassium sodium phosphate, pH 7.4 , at ambient temperature, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin) to a concentration of 40 mg/mL and is immediately added to tubes to start the assay. The protein content of the crude membrane suspension can be determined by the method of O. H. Lowery et al., J. Biol. Chem., 193 265 (1951).</p>\n  The binding assay is carried out in duplicate or triplicate in 12 x 75 mm polypropylene tubes in 50 mM potassium sodium phosphate (pH 7.4, at ambient temperature) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The radioligand, [ 3H]-pyrilamine, is diluted in incubation buffer to a concentration of 2 nM and added to each tube (50 \u03bcL). The test compound is diluted in incubation \n\nbuffer (10-10 M to 10-5 ) and is added to the appropriate tubes (50 \u03bcL) . The assay is started by the addition of 250 \u03bcL of well mixed tissue suspension. The final incubation volume is 0.5 mL. The assay is carried out at ambient temperature for 30 minutes. The incubation is terminated by the addition of 3.5 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution (4\u00b0C) and filtration through GF/B filters that have been presoaked overnight in 0.1% polyethyleneimine, using a Brandel cell harvester. The filters are rapidly washed with two 3.5 mL portions of incubation buffer and transferred to scintillation vials. Ecolume (9 mL) is added the the vials. the vials are shaken and allowed to set for 4 hours before being counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Specific binding is determined bas the difference between tubes containing no test compound and the the tubes containing 10 \u03bcM pyrilamine. Total membrane bound radioactivity is generally about 5% of that added the the tubes. Specific binding is generally 75% to 90% of total binding as determined by the method of M. D. DeBacker et al., Biochem. and Biophys. Res. Commun., 197(3) 1601 (1991).</p>\n  The molar concentration of compound that causes 50% inhibition of radioligand binding. The IC<sub>50</sub> value is generated for each test compound by nonlinear regression using an iterative curve fitting program (Graph PAD Inplot, San Diego, CA) .</p>\n  EXAMPLE B Antagonism of iodinated tachykinin binding to NKi receptors by putative antagonists</p>\n  One skilled in the art can measure the Ki receptor affinity of proposed tachykinin antagonists as evaluated in guinea pig lungs (Keystone Biologicals, Cleveland, OH). Tissues are homogenized with a Polytron in 15 volumes of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4, 4\u00b0C) and centrifuged. The pellet is resuspended in Tris-HCl buffer and centrifuged; the pellet is washed twice by resuspension. The final \n\npellet is resuspended at a concentration of 40 mg/ml incubation buffer and remains at room temperature for at least 15 min prior to use. Receptor binding is initiated by addition of 250 \u03bcl membrane preparation in duplicate to 0.1 nM of i25\u03c7-Bolton Hunter Lys-3 labeled substance P in a final volume of 500 \u03bcl of buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4 at room temperature), 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 2 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, 40 \u03bcg/ml bacitracin, 4 \u03bcg/ml leupeptin and chymostatin, 1 \u03bcM thiorphan and various doses of the putative tachykinin antagonists. Incubations are performed at room temperature for 90 min; binding is terminated by addition of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4, 4\u00b0C) and filtration under vacuum through GF/B filters presoaked with 0.1% polyethylenei ine. Filter bound radioactivity is quantitated in a gamma counter. Nonspecific binding is defined as binding in the presence of 1 \u03bcM substance P. Specific binding is calculated by subtracting nonspecific binding from total binding. Competition of iodinated substance P binding by test compounds or standards is expressed as a percentage of this maximum competition. IC<sub>50<",

When the slope of the lines obtained by a Schild analysis are not significantly different from one (1) the compound is acting as a competitive antagonist.</p>\n  EXAMPLE E</p>\n  Evaluation of Hi (or NKi) antagonism in vivo</p>\n  One skilled in the art can determine that the compounds of the present invention mediate the immediate hypersensitivity response in vivo by evaluating the ability of the compounds to inhibit the formation of histamine (or substance P) induced wheals in guinea pigs. Animals are anesthetized with pentobarbital (i.p.). Dorsal skin is shaved and intradermal injections of histamine (or substance P) are given in the shaved area at appropriate times after the administration of the test compounds. Doses, routes, and times of administration may vary according to experimental design. The design of such experiments is well known and appreciated in the art. Immediately after the intradermal challenges, the animal is given an intravenous injection of 1% Evan's blue dye to make the wheals visible. At an appropriate time after the challenge the animals are sacrificed by CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation. \n\nThe skin is removed and the diameter of each wheal is measured in two perpendicular directions.</p>\n  The wheal response is used an the index of the edema response. The percent of inhibition of the wheal response is calculated by comparing the drug-treated group to a vehicle treated group. Linear regression of the dose- response inhibition curve is used to determine an ED<sub>50</sub> value, expressed in mg/kg.</p>\n  EXAMPLE F</p>\n  Evaluation of NKi antagonism in \u03c5ivo</p>\n  One skilled in the art can also determine that the compounds of the present invention are NKi receptor antagonists in \u03c5ivo by evaluating the compound's ability to inhibit substance P-induced plasma protein extravasation in guinea pig trachea. Substance P-induced protein leakage through postcapillary venules is assessed by measuring Evans Blue dye accumulation in guinea pig trachea. Animals are anesthetized with pentobarbitol ther. injected with Evans Blue dye (20 mg/kg, i.v., prepared in 0.9% sodium chloride solution) . One minute after dye administration, the antagonist is administered (i.v.) followed by substance P (0.3 nmole/kg, i.v.) and, after 5 min, excess dye removed from the circulation by transcardiac perfusion with 50 ml 0.9% sodium chloride solution. The trachea and primary bronchi are removed, blotted dry and weighed.</p>\n  Dye quantitation is performed spectrophotometrically (620 nm) after extracting tissues in formamide for 24 hr at 50\u00b0C. Values are subtracted from background (dye only, no agonist). ED<sub>50</sub> (dose of compound which inhibits substance P-induced plasma protein extravasation by 50%) is calculated from linear regression analysis. \n</p>\n"
