{"raw_mentions": "None of the provided sentences contain all the required elements: a bioactivity metric (IC50, Ki, Kd, EC50), a specific numeric value associated with that metric, and a unit for that value. However, one sentence mentions \"Ki\" but lacks a specific numeric value and unit:\n\n\nThe tachykinins are widely distributed in the peripheral and central nervous systems where they bind to at least three receptors types. Among the tachykinin receptors, the Ki, NK<sub>2</sub>, and NK<sub>3</sub> receptors are defined by the preferred binding affinity of substance P, neurokinin A (NKA) , and neurokinin B (NKB), respectively.\n\n\nSince this does not meet the criteria, there are no sentences to return based on the given instructions."}
