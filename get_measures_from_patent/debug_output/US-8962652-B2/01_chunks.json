In particular, in anti-cancer therapy, combination with other anti-neoplastic agent (including chemotherapeutic, hormonal or antibody agents) is envisaged as well as combination with surgical therapy and radiotherapy. Combination therapies according to the present invention thus comprise the administration of at least one compound of formula (I) or a salt or solvate thereof, and the use of at least one other cancer treatment method. Preferably, combination therapies according to the present invention comprise the administration of at least one compound of formula (I) or a salt or solvate thereof, and at least one other pharmaceutically active agent, preferably an anti-neoplastic agent. The compound(s) of formula (I)) and the other pharmaceutically active agent(s) may be administered together or separately and, when administered separately this may occur simultaneously or sequentially in any order (including administration on different days according to the therapy regimen) and by any convenient route. The amounts of the compound(s) of formula (I) and the other pharmaceutically active agent(s) and the relative timings of administration will be selected in order to a"
