In one embodiment the FVII polypeptide according to the invention comprises one or more substitutions relative to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 in any one of the EGF-like domain 1 or EGF-like domain 2 of said FVIIa polypeptide. \n\n In one embodiment the substitution relative to the amino acid sequence of SEQ</p>ID NO: 1 in any one of the EGF-like domain 1 or EGF-like domain 2 of the FVIIa polypeptide according to the invention is in one or more position selected from the list consisting of Lys38, Ile42, Gly47, Asp48, Ala51, Ser53, Gln56, Gly58, Gln66, Ser67, Leu73, Pro74, Ala75, His84, Asp86, Asp87, Leu89, Glu94, Gly97, AsplO4, HislO5, ThrlO6, GlylO7, ThrlO\u03b4, LyslO9, Serl ll, Argll3, Glull6, Serl l9, Leul21, Alal22, Aspl23, Glyl24, Thrl28, Prol29, Thrl30, Vall31, Glul32, and Glul42.</p>In one embodiment the Factor VII polypeptide according to the invention has a modified structure of N-linked and/or O-linked oligosaccharides.</p>The term \"subject\" as used herein is intended to mean any animal, in particular mammals, such as humans, and may, where appropriate, be used interchangeably with the term \"patient\".</p>The term \"binding affinity\" as used herein is intended to mean the strength of interaction between FVII polypeptides and GPIb-V-IX complex or the extracellular part of GPIb\u03b1, also called glycocalicin. An important parameter that characterizes such non- covalent interaction at equilibrium is the dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>). At equilibrium, the Kd is the product of the free receptor concentration and the free ligand concentration divided with the concentration of the receptor-ligand-complex given by the following expression: Kd = [receptor <sub>free</sub>] x [ligand <sub>free</sub>] /([receptor-ligand <sub>comp</sub>\u03b9<sub>ex</sub>]).</p>A low Kd value means a high binding affinity and is related to a strong interaction between FVII polypeptides and GPIb\u03b1. Whereas, a relative higher Kd value means a relative lower binding affinity and is thus related to a weaker interaction between FVII polypeptides and GPIb\u03b1. In surface plasmon resonance analysis the Kd is defined as the ratio between K(off) rate and K(on) rate (the rate of dissociation of the ligand and the rate of the association of the ligand, respectively) as described previously (Lenting PJ et al. J Biol Chem 274: 23734 - 23739, 1999). In other assays, such as the static platelet adhesion assay a Kd value can not be determined and the binding affinity of a given FVII polypeptide to GPIb\u03b1 is evaluated relative to wild-type rFVIIa and thus reflect a semiquantitative evaluation.</p>The phrase \"FVII polypeptide different from human wild-type FVIIa\" as used herein is intended to mean a FVII polypetide different in any physical aspect from recom- binant Factor VII with wild-type sequence (i.e. the amino acid sequence disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,784,950) expressed by transfected CHO cells grown at serum-containing \n\n conditions and purified as described in (Jurlander B et al. Thromb Hemost 27: 373-383,</p>2001), i.e. Novoseven<sup>\u00ae</sup>. The phrase \"FVII polypeptide different from human wild-type FVIIa\" is therefore intended to encompass both Factor Vila polypeptides with wild-type amino acid sequence grown under different conditions to give a FVII polypeptide, that is different by e.g. glycosylation patterns, as well as amino acid variants of Factor VII, Factor VII derivatives and Factor VII conjugates.</p>The terms \"human platelet glycoprotein Ib alpha\" and \"GPIb\u03b1\" as used herein refers to the polypeptide having the amino acid sequence disclosed in reference (Wenger RH et al. Biochem Biophys Res Commun : 156(1), 389-95, 1988). GPIb\u03b1 is part of the GPIb-V-IX receptor complex where two molecules of GPIb\u03b1 is associated with two GPIb beta molecules, two GPIX molecules and one GPV molecule (Berndt M C Thromb Haemost 86: 178-88, 2001; Andrews RK et al.

Science 297(5584) : 1176-1179, 2002) or rFVIIa was immobilized on a CM5-sensor chip using BIAcore2000 biosensor system and amine-coupling kit as prescribed by the supplier (Biacore AB, Breda, The Netherlands). The immobilisation to the chip was done in sodium acetate pH of 5.0. Prior to the immobilisation the chip was acti- vated with l-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride/ N- hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS) for 7 min at 5 ul/min. Immobilisation was done until \n\n about 1000 to 1500 RU was coated on the chip. After that the chip was blocked for 7 min at 5 ul/min with ethanolamine HCI. A control chip was routinely activated and blocked in the absence of protein. Binding to coated chips was corrected for binding to non-coated chips. Different concentrations of rFVIIa (on the glycocalicin-coated chip), glycocalicin (on the rFVIIa-coated chip), or a recombinant fragment of GPIb\u03b1 (amino acid 1-290, on the rFVIIa-coated chip) in HEPES buffer (150 mM NaCI, 2 mM CaCI<sub>2</sub>, 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20, and 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4) were perfused over the chip with a flow rate of 5 ul/min, and maximal response was evaluated at equilibrium. Regeneration of the sensor chip surface was performed by incubating with 0.1 M Tris and 10 mM taurodeoxycholic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) at pH 9.0. The result showed that rFVIIa bind to immobilized glycocalicin (figure 4A) but not to recombinant GPIb\u03b1 lacking the glycosylated stack (amino acid 1- 290, not shown). The Kd value for rFVIIa binding to glycocalicin was determined to approximately 70 nM (figure 4B). The data demonstrate that the glycosylated stack of GPIb\u03b1 is important for rFVIIa binding.</p>Example 5</p>Binding of cells expressing GPIb\u03b1 on immobilized rFVIIa</p>The interaction between GPIb\u03b1 and rFVIIa is confirmed in a cell-based binding assay with</p>CHO cells stabile transfected with human GPIb-IX-V complex (Luo, S-Z et al. Blood, 109(2) :603-609, 2007). rFVIIa was immobilized for 2 hrs at 37<sup>0</sup>C on an Immulon-2 flat- bottom microtiter plate (Dynatech Laboratories Inc, Chantilly, VA) and subsequently blocked with 2% BSA for at least 30 min. CHO-GPIb-IX-V cells (suspended at 10<sup>6</sup> cells per ml in DMEM : F-12, 0.5% BSA, 1 mM CaCI<sub>2</sub>, 25 uM ZnCI<sub>2</sub>) were allowed to adhere for 90 min at 37<sup>0</sup>C. After extensive washing with Tris-buffered saline, intrinsic phosphatase activity was measured using p-nitrophenol (pNP, 3 mg/ml dissolved in 50 mM acetic acid, 1% Triton X-100, pH 5.0). The reaction was stopped after 30 min with 1 M NaOH and the optical density was measured at 405 nm. The optical density increased linear with the amount of cells adhered. The data showed that wildtype CHO cells did not bind to rFVIIa- covered surface (figure 5A). Only CHO cells transfected with the GPIb-IX-V complex bind to the rFVIIa-covered surface (figure 5A). Moreover, this binding was inhibited by specific mouse monoclonal antibodies against the human rFVII EGFl (FVII-4F9, IgGl subclone A106B5), EGF2 (FVII-4F7, IgGl subclone A4B101) and the Gla-domain (FVII-3F1 IgGl subclone A2B1C4), (not shown). Furthermore, Fab fragments of anti-FVIIa-EGF2 also inhibited the binding (not shown). Experiments showed that CHO-GPIb-IX-V cells bind to immobilized zymogen FVII but did not bind to rFVI",

A quantitation of the content of the O- glycoforms in the two peak fractions could not be obtained due to relatively low rFVIIa content in the fractions. Tryptic peptide mapping : Other peptide fragments of rFVIIa co- eluted with or eluted close to the O-glycopeptides, and the content of O-glycopeptides in low amounts could therefore not be determined. Total mass analysis: Other O- and/or N- glycoforms of rFVIIa, for example N-glycoforms of rFVIIa lacking one N-acetylneuraminic acid, appeared in the mass spectra, and the content of O-glycoforms of rFVIIa in low amounts could therefore not be determined.</p>The specific activities of the peak fractions obtained from the HIC were determined by the 1st generation clotting assay.</p>The enhanced binding affinity of the FVII polypeptides described above are studied in the screening assays described in example 14. The data is validated using cell adhesion as described in example 7 and 8, and the functional consequence determined in the assays measuring TF-independent factor X activation and thrombin generation de- scribed in example 10 and 11, respectively. \n\n Example 11 rFVIIa mutants</p>Polypeptide variants of rFVIIa are generated by random mutagenesis in selected regions of rFVIIa. Results suggest that the EGFl and EGF2 domains of rFVIIa are important for binding to GPIb\u03b1 as measured by ELISA and in the cell-based binding assay (described in example 3 and 5, respectively). Moreover, data suggest that rFVIIa bound to soluble tissue factor also associates with GPIb\u03b1 measured in the cell-based binding assay with CHO cells stabil transfected with human GPIb-IX-V complex as described in example 5. This part of the invention relates to polypeptide variants of rFVIIa, which comprise an amino acid substitution or amino acid substitutions in the EGFl and EGF2 domain of the light chain of rFVIIa. The amino acid positions being modified will preferably be taken from the pool of side chains of the EGFl and EGF2 domains having a relative surface accessibility &gt; 40% as estimated from the x-ray crystal log rap hie structure of human rFVIIa in complex with soluble TF (The Protein Data Bank entry: ldan. Reference: H. M. Berman et al. The Protein Data Bank). Nucleic Acids Research, 28 pp. 235-242 (2000). Hence, side chains in close contact to soluble TF are not considered. The list is given below where ASAl is the total accessible of the residue alone in the conformation in the given structure in Angstroms squared. ASA2 is the total accessible surface area (as seen by e.g. a water molecule) in Angstroms squared. ReI.

The absorbance developed during 10 minutes, after subtraction of the absorbance in a blank well containing no rFVIIa, is used to calculate the ratio between the proteolytic activities of variant and wild-type Factor Vila:</p>Ratio = (A405 nm Factor Vila variant)/(A405 nm Factor Vila wild-type). \n\n Example 14</p>Screening plan rFVIIa variants with an amidolytic and proteolytic activity at least similar to rFVIIa determine in the in vitro hydrolysis assay and proteolysis assay described in example 12 and 13, respectively, will be included in the screening plan. Screening methods for identification of rFVIIa variants with enhanced TF-independent activity due to enhanced binding to GPIb\u03b1 involves the following five assays:</p>Screening assay 1 using surface plasmon resonance with immobilised glycocalicin : Biacore assay with glycocalicin immobilised on a CM5-sensor chip is carried out as described in example 6. Briefly, glycocalicin purified from plasma as described in example 4 are immobilized on a CM5-sensor chip at a density of 1000 - 1500 RU using amine-coupling. After blockage different concentrations of rFVIIa or rFVIIa variants are perfused over the chip at a flow of 5 ul/min as described in example 6, and maximal re- sponse are evaluated at equilibrium. The rFVIIa variant should have improved binding affinity with at least 20 % lower Kd for binding to glycocalicin than that of wildtype rFVIIa</p>Screening assay 2 using ELISA with glycocalicin-coated microtiter plates:</p>Binding to glycocalicin-coated microtiter plates is performed as decribed in ex- ample 4. Briefly, glycocalicin (2 ug/ml) purified from plasma as in example 4 is allowed to adhere to immobilized rFVIIa or rFVIIa variants as described in example 4. After blocking the wells bound glycocalicin are detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against GPIb and a peroxidase-labeled swine-anti-rabbit antibody, followed by TNB staining. Results are obtained by measuring optical density at 490 nm on a SpectraMax Reader. In- creased binding is defined as at least 20 % enhanced binding affinity compared to wild- type rFVIIa.</p>Screening assay 3 using GPIb-V-IX-transfected CHO cells:</p>Binding of GPIb-V-IX-transfected CHO cells to rFVIIa variants is analyzed using immobilized rFVIIa variants as described in example 5.

Increased binding in the screening assays is defined as at least 20 % enhanced binding affinity compared to wild-type rFVIIa.</p>Screening assay 4 using static platelet adhesion : \n\n Binding of activated platelets to rFVIIa variants is analyzed using immobilized rFVIIa variants as described in example 6.
