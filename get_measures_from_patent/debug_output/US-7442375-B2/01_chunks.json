For example, \u201cto treat an HIV infection\u201d means to improve a subject's ability to resist HIV contraction or inhibit HIV replication in the subject, or to relieve symptoms of a condition related to HIV infection in a patient, wherein the improvement and relief are evaluated using a clinically acceptable standard.</p>3. BD Agents</p>The invention provides methods and compositions relating to BD agents, and preferably BD agents having antiviral activity. Preferred embodiments of the invention employ BD agents having antiviral activity against viruses (e.g., HIV) that associate with a chemokine receptor, (e.g., CXCR4).</p>A BD agent of the invention can be any agent having antiviral activity and ha",
    "th different concentrations of the candidate BD agent to determine the agent's anti-HIV effectiveness. The HIV-agent mixtures may then be used to infect cells, e.g., peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), MT-4 and CEM X4/R5 T-cells. After a suitable time (e.g., 2 hours at 37\u00b0 C.) of incubation, the cells may be cultured further (e.g., for 48 hours), and cell-free supernatants from these cultured cells can then be used to monitor infectivity by a reverse transcriptase assay. It will be obvious to a skilled artisan to modify the conditions and other variables of the exemplary assay. For example, HIV, a candidate BD agent, and the cells may be incubated together without preincubation of the HIV and the agent; the time length of incubation may also be modified.</p>A candidate BD agent's anti-HIV activity may also be evaluated based on its ability to interact with a chemokine receptor. By \u201cinteract with a chemokine receptor\u201d herein is meant binding to a chemokine receptor or causing internalization of a chemokine receptor. While not wishing to bound by a particular theory, binding of a BD agent to a chemokine receptor may cause internalization of the chemokine receptor thus reducing cell surface expression of the chemokine receptor.</p>A candidate BD agent's ability to bind a chemokine receptor may be evaluated using a cell-free assay or cell-based assay (see Example 5). A fragment of the chemokine receptor (e.g., extracellular domain) responsible for binding may be used in a binding assay to screen for BD agents. Competitive binding assays may also be employed using a chemokine receptor's natural ligand (e.g., stromal cell derived factor 1 (SDF-1) for CXCR4) and a candidate BD agent.</p>A candidate BD agent's ability to interact with a chemokine receptor may be evaluated using a cell-based assay to determine cell surface expression of the chemokine receptor when exposed to the candidate BD agent. Example 5 illustrates a method of determining whether a BD agent can downmodulate cell surface expression of a chemokine receptor.</p>A candidate BD agent's anti-HIV activity may also be evaluated based on its ability to interact with HIV virions. A candidate BD agent's ability to interaction with HIV virions may be evaluated using a binding assay mixture comprising the candidate BD agent and virions. Example 6 illustrates a binding assay and a method to determine whether a BD agent binds to an HIV virion.</p>Generally, BD agents which can bind with molecules related to the viral infection process (e.g., a chemokine receptor, a fragment of a chemokine receptor, or a virion) may be identified by reacting one of the molecules with a test agent which potentially binds to the molecule, under conditions which permit binding of the molecule and test agent, and detecting binding. Binding may be detected by assaying for agent-molecule conjugates, for free agent, or for non-complexed molecules, or other alteration of the molecule (e.g., internalization of a chemokine receptor). Conditions which permit the formation of agent-molecule conjugates may be selected having regard to factors such as the nature and amounts of the agent and the molecule.</p>The agent-molecule conjugate, free agent or non-complexed molecules may be isolated by conventional isolation techniques, for example, salting out, chromatography, electrophoresis, gel filtration, fractionation, absorption, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, agglutination, or combinations thereof. To facilitate the assay of the components, antibody against the molecule or the agent, or labeled molecule, or a labeled agent may be utilized. The antibodies, proteins, or agents may be labeled with a detectable substance, such as radiolabeling or fluorescent labeling.</p>A molecule, or complex of the invention, or the agent used in the method of the invention may be",
    "-650).</p>Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of agents and compositions of the invention can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the Ld50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the Ed50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Agents or compositions which exhibit large therapeutic induces are preferred. While agents or compositions that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such agents or compositions to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects.</p>The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such agents or compositions lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any agent or composition used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test agent or composition which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.</p>EXEMPLIFICATIONThe invention now being generally described, it will be more readily understood by reference to the following examples, which are included merely for purposes of illustration of certain aspects and embodiments of the present invention, and are not intended to limit the invention.</p>For reasons poorly understood, transmission of HIV-1 through oral secretions is uncommon [Rogers et al.; Moore et al.]. Despite the ready demonstration of HIV-1 RNA, proviral DNA and infected cells in salivary secretions of infected persons [Goto, et al.; Baron et al.], infectious virus is rarely isolated from saliva [Rogers et al.; Barr et al.; Coppenhaver, et al.]. Thus, diminished infectivity of HIV-1 within oropharyngeal tissues [Herz et al.] may underlie the infrequent transmission of HIV-1 through this route. A better understanding of this apparent protection is particularly important as more than 90% of HIV-1 cases worldwide have been transmitted across other mucosal surfaces [Smith et al.].</p>Numerous studies have been conducted to identify the HIV inhibitory activity in saliva of healthy and infected individuals [reviewed by Shugars et al.]. Many salivary inhibitors of HIV-1 have been proposed; e.g., amylase, lactoferrin, proline-rich peptides, salivary mucins, thrombospondin, and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor [Id.]. The importance of these agents in oral mucosal protection remains to be demonstrated. It is shown here that mRNA expression of beta-defensins can be induced in oral epithelial cells by exposure to HIV-1 and that these defensins can inhibit HIV propagation in vitro. In contrast to other mucosal body sites, where hBD-2 and -3 are induced only during inflammation [O'Neil et al.; Wehkamp et al; Bajaj-Elliott et al.; Ong et al.; Liu et al.], expression of these host defense agents is always measurable even in normal uninflamed oral epithelium [Dale et al.]. Since the reported concentration of hBD-2 in normal oral epithelium is about 10 \u03bcmoles/g tissue [Sawaki et al.], well within the inhibitory concentrations reported in the in vitro experiments with the X4 phenotype, further induction of hBD-2 (or hBD-3) by mucosal exposure to virus may provide protection against X4-tropic and potentially also against R5-tropic viruses. It should be noted that induction of hBD mRNA expression in NHOEC is accompanied by increased expression of hBD protein. (A. Weinberg et al., unpublished data).</p>As shown in the examples and figures herein, HIV-1 induced expression of hBD-2 and -3 mRNA in normal human oral epithelium and cells (\u201cNHOEC\u201d) and that these defensins, but not hBD-1, inhibit HIV-1 replication in immunocompetent cells. Inhibition involves the binding of HIV-1 directly, as well as an additional downmodulation of cell surface CXCR4 expression. Inhibition of HIV-1 replication by beta-defensins may play an important role in protecting the oral cavity and other mucosal surfaces from infection; preferential inhibition of CXCR4-tropic (X4) HIV-1 strains may help to explain the selective acquisition of CCR5-tropic (R5) HIV-1 isolates after in vivo mucosal exposure.</p>While it is premature to speculate how beta-defensins bind HIV-1, an interaction with gp120 is plausible. Polyanionic compounds exert their anti-HIV-1 activity by binding to the positively charged sites in the V3 loop of gp120 [Schols et al.; Witvrouw et al.]. Like other polycationic peptides which block infection with X4 HIV-1 isolates (e.g., T22, T134, and ALX40-4C) [De Clercq et al.], the direct antiretroviral effect of beta-defensins might be predicted to be very different, perhaps interacting with other viral surface domains.</p>Example 1Materials and MethodsCells and Viruses</p>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and interleukin (IL)-2 [Pauwels et al.]. MT4 and CEM X4/R5 T-cell lines, and GHOST CXCR4 and CCR5-transfected osteosarcoma cells cotransfected with the HIV-2 long terminal repeat driving expression of the green fluorescent protein (hGFP), and all viral isolates were obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. Normal human oral epithelium and cells (NHOEC) were prepared as described [Krisanaprakorkit et al., 1998 and 2000]. Viral stocks were propagated in PHA-stimulated, IL-2 treated PBMC, and tissue culture dose for 50% infectivity was determined [Quinones-Mateu et al.].</p>Generation of Recombinant Human \u03b2-Defensins (hBDs)</p>Re"
