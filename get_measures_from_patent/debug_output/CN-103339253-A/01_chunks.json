    "teosarcoma, prostate cancer, kidney, SCLC, NSCLC and soft tissue neoplasm.</p>The present invention also provides the panimmunity assay method, for detection of and/or quantitatively TOMM34 albumen (SEQ ID NO:42) or its fragment, comprise peptide of the present invention.This type of assay method can comprise as required that one or more can identify and in conjunction with the anti-TOMM34 antibody of TOMM34 albumen or its fragment.In linguistic context of the present invention, the anti-TOMM34 antibody of being combined with the TOMM34 polypeptide is preferably identified peptide of the present invention.The binding specificity of antibody can be confirmed with suppressing test.That is, when being combined between the antibody that will analyze and the total length TOMM34 polypeptide is suppressed under the peptide existence of the present invention, prove that this antibodies specific is in conjunction with this fragment.In linguistic context of the present invention, this type of immunologic assay method is implemented with various immunologic assay forms well known in the art, include but not limited to various types of radioimmunoassays, immunochromatography technique, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), enzyme linked immunological fluorometry (ELIFA), etc.</p>Related immune of the present invention is learned but the assay method of non-antibody also comprises T cell immunogenicity assay method (inhibition or irritating) and main histocompatibility complex (MHC) binding assay.In addition, the present invention also provides the radioimmunological imaging method that can detect the cancer of expressing TOMM34, includes but not limited to use the radiation scintillography method through the antibody of the present invention of mark.This type of assay method can be used for expressing detection, monitoring and the prognosis of the cancer of TOMM34 clinically, described cancer but be not limited to AML, CML, bladder cancer, mammary cancer, cervical cancer, colorectal carcinoma, esophagus cancer, liver cancer, osteosarcoma, prostate cancer, kidney, SCLC, NSCLC and soft tissue neoplasm.</p>The present invention also provides the antibody of being combined with peptide of the present invention.Antibody of the present invention can use in any form, for example mono-clonal or polyclonal antibody, and comprise the polyclone of antiserum(antisera) by obtaining with peptide immune animal of the present invention (such as rabbit), all kinds and monoclonal antibody, and the people's antibody and the humanized antibody that generate by genetic recombination.</p>The peptide that be used for to obtain antibody as antigen of the present invention can derive from any animal species, but preferably derives from Mammals, such as people, mouse or rat, more preferably derives from the people.The peptide that derives from the people can be obtained by Nucleotide disclosed herein or aminoacid sequence.</p>According to the present invention, the peptide that "
