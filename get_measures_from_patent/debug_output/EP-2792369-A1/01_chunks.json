The animals were kept 5 per cage with an air filter cover under light (12 light/dark cycle, light on at 6H00) and temperature (22\u00b0 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C)-controlled environment. All manipulations of animals were performed under a sterilized laminar hood. The animals had ad libitum access to Purina mouse chow (Pro Lab PMH 4018, Trademark of Agway, Syracuse, New York) and water. These animal studies were conducted according to the \"Guidelines for Care and Use of Experimental Animals\".\nTumor cell culture:\nLewis Lung carcinoma 3LL cells were cultured in the appropriated culture medium. The cells were harvested in their logarithmic growth phase for the preparation of tumor implantation.\nTumor Implantation:\nLewis Lung carcinoma 3LL cells (2.0 to 5.0 x 105 cells in 200 ul PBS) were implanted intravenously by tail vein to establish experimental lung metastasis tumor models.\nTreatments:\nThe treatments were performed on day after tumor implantation. The animals were dosed with the following dosing solutions.\nControl: (0.9%, NaCl)\nCompositions:\nnon-formulated bendamustine (BM), (50 mg/kg)Bendamustine (50 mg/kg) in 20% SBECD, 1% LMWP\nEfficacy Evaluation:\nMetastasis formation was evaluated by counting the numbers of metastasis spots on the lung surface. Routine metastasis examination were done for all organs at the end of the study.</p>The results of efficacy evaluation are presented in Table 10 below.\nTable 10TreatmentLung metastasis number (animal number)Inhibition on metastasis formation vs control, (%)Inhibition on metastasis formation vs not formulated BM (%)Control65.5 \u00b1 7.8 (8)0-BM (50 mg/kg)56.1 \u00b1 9.5 (9)14.40BM (50 mg/kg), 20%SBECD, 1%LMWP37.0 \u00b1 8.1 (9)43.5 **34.0 *** Statistically significant, p &lt; 0.01\n* Statistically significant, p &lt; 0.05</p>The results show statistically significant improvement of efficacy of the composition comprising SBECD and LMWP vs. non-formulated drug.</p>Example 27. Efficacy of bendamustine compositions on human breast carcinoma (MDA-MB 231) subcutaneous (s.c.) solid tumours in nude mice.Animal:\nbalb/c mice aged 5 to 6 weeks were purchased from Charles River Canada Inc. The animals were kept 5 per cage with an air filter cover under light (12 light/dark cycle, light on at 6H00) and temperature (22\u00b0C \u00b1 1\u00b0C)-controlled environment.

These animal studies were conducted according to the \"Guidelines for Care and Use of Experimental Animals\".\nTumor cell culture:\nHuman breast cancer cells MDA-MB 231 were cultured in the appropriated culture medium. The cells were harvested in their logarithmic growth phase for the preparation of tumor implantation.\nTumor Implantation:\nHuman tumor or myeloma cells (2.5 to 5.0 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells) were implanted subcutaneously in 0.200 mL of medium containing 30% Matrigel on the two flanks of balb/c nu/nu mice through a 1 to 2 cm long 20-gauge needle.\nTreatments:\n2 to 3 weeks after tumor cell implantation, animals that developed s.c. solid tumors were selected and divided into several homogeneous groups (n = 5 animals per group or dose) with respect to tumor size (0.5 to 0.8 cm in diameter). The treatments were performed next day. The animals were dosed with the following dosing solutions.\nControl: (0.9%, NaCl)\nCompositions:\nnon-formulated Bendamustine, (35 mg/kg)Bendamustine (35 mg/kg) in 40% SBECD, 1% protamine sulfate (formulated BM)\nEfficacy Evaluation:\nSubcutaneous solid tumor measurements were performed on the day of first injection and at 3- to 4-day intervals thereafter. The two largest perpendicular diameters of each tumor were measured with calipers and tumor sizes were estimated using the formula:\nTV = L x W /2 where TV: tumor volume; L: length; W: width.</p>The body weights of animals were also noted.</p>The results are presented in Table 11 below.\nTable 11Groups (number of animals)Body weight on day 14 (g)Tumor volume on day 14 (g) (number of tumors)Inhibition % vs control (on day 14)RemarksControl (0.9%, NaCl) (5)19.9 \u00b1 0.35 (4)1.80 \u00b1 0.19 (8)-1 of 5 dead on day 11 due to tumor metastasis.
