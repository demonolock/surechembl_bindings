    "lial cells that lead to unfavorable remodeling through poorly-defined mechanisms.</p>After injury, myocyte numbers decrease (American Heart Association, 2003; Topol, 2003). It is well established that there is a direct correlation between the irreversible loss of cardiomyocytes and progression of cardiac dysfunction, adverse remodeling and eventual failure (American Heart Association, 2003; Topol, 2003; Cleutjens et al., 1999). Current therapies have reduced early mortality following MI but fail to address the primary cause of impaired function, the loss of myocytes (Topol, 2003; Sharpe, 2004; Sutton and Sharpe, 2000). Two strategies are being intensely investigated: stem cell transplantation and induction of myocyte proliferation.</p>Cardiomyocytes exit the cell cycle shortly after birth, and the adult mammalian heart is considered incapable of regeneration after injury (van Amerongen and Engel, 2008). In non-mammalian models (i.e. zebrafish) studies have demonstrated that lost myocardial tissue can be replenished by dedifferentiation and proliferation of differentiated cardiomyocytes (Kikuchi et al., 2010; Jopling et al., 2010). There are several lines of evidence that support the hypothesis that induction of cardiomyocyte proliferation can also promote mammalian heart regeneration. Analysis of human heart failure autopsy tissues indicate that individuals with early mortality have increased percentage of apoptotic myocytes and decreased expression of proliferation markers (Ki-67) compared to longer survivors (Swynghedauw, 1999). Forced cardiac expression of positive regulators of cell cycle progression (i.e. Cyclin A2 or Cyclin D2) in transgenic mice demonstrate enhanced cardiac function and improved remodeling following ischemic injury (van Amerongen and Engel, 2008; Chaudhry et al., 2004). Periostin and FGF1/p38 inhibitors promote myocyte proliferation and also improve cardiac repair (Engel et al., 2006; Kuhn et al., 2007). In summary, augmenting cardiomyocyte number by stimulating cardiomyocyte cell division may help cardiac regeneration following injury.</p>In spite of these promising reports, it is unlikely that inducing myocyte proliferation alone is sufficient to promote cardiac repair. For example, p38 inhibition (in the absence of FGF) was found to be insufficient to promote repair despite inducing myocyte proliferation (Engel et al., 2006). In addition, c-Myc-induced cardiomyocyte proliferation did not result in improved cardiac function (van Amerongen and Engel, 2008). Thus, other cellular effects and/or modulation of tissue stroma and vasculature may also be important. Finally, none of these extrinsic agents (i.e. periostin, FGF/p38 inhibitors) have been translated into feasible and effective therapies to repair the injured heart. Therefore, new and improved therapeutics for to promote cardiac repair and impede pathogenic cardiac remodeling are needed.</p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThus, in accordance with the present invention, there is provided a method of inhibiting Wnt-mediated remodeling of cardiac tissue comprising administering to a subject identified as needing cardiac tissue remodeling an IgM antibody that binds to LRP5/6. Administering may comprise intravenous, intraarterial or intracardiac administration. The subject may be a human.

Building on their previous work with Wnt inhibitors in cancer, the inventors here show that administration of pyrvinium (a known Wnt inhibitor) into the myocardium showed more favorable ventricular remodeling compared to control in a mouse model of acute MI. Despite the fact that only a single injection of pyrvinium could be administered (due to its toxicity), there was a remarkable therapeutic benefit. These exciting preliminary data less to follow-up work focused on assessing the effect of more long-term therapeutic Wnt inhibition on myocardial repair and regeneration.</p>Although antibodies against LRP5/6 have been reported, there have been none described that inhibit Wnt signaling in vitro or in vivo. The inventors generated a well-tolerated LRP5/6 monoclonal antibody that inhibits Wnt signaling in vivo. Using this innovative tool, the inventors have begun to dissect pharmacologic inhibition of Wnt signaling over an extended time and establish anti-Wnt regimens for the treatment of heart disease. Therapeutic Wnt inhibition is likely to have significant potential in cardiac repair and regeneration and perhaps more broadly in repair of other tissues. Thus, the inventors' efforts to pioneer the use of an anti-LRP5/6 antibody to inhibit Wnt signaling will have important implications for regenerative medicine in general and, more specifically, for the treatment of MI. These and other aspects of the invention are described in greater detail below.</p>I. WNT SIGNALING AND LRP5/6A. Wnt Signaling through LRP5/6</p>Wnt ligands bind their cognate Frizzled-family receptors to regulate diverse biological processes including cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, and differentiation (Reya and Clevers, 2005; Widelitz, 2005; Shtutman et al., 1999; Tahinci and Lee, 2004). The central player of the \u201ccanonical\u201d (Wnt/\u03b2-catenin) pathway is \u03b2-catenin, which is maintained at a low level in the cytoplasm by its association with a complex (axin, APC, GSK3\u03b2) that promotes its phosphorylation and targeted destruction (FIG. 1) (Reya and Clevers, 2005; Widelitz, 2005; Shtutman et al., 1999; Tahinci and Lee, 2004). Upon binding of Wnt by Frizzled and the LRP5 or 6 coreceptor (LRP5/6), the destruction complex is inhibited; \u03b2-catenin accumulates and trans-locates to the nucleus where it interacts with the Tcf/Lef1 transcription factors to regulate Wnt-specific gene expression (Reya and Clevers, 2005; Widelitz, 2005; Shtutman et al., 1999; Tahinci and Lee, 2004). \u201cNon-canonical\u201d Wnt signaling (e.g. planar cell pol",
    "enesis (Cleutjens et al., 1999; Foley and Mercola, 2005; Salloway, 2003). Prior to gastrulation, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling promotes cardiac differentiation whereas signaling during gastrulation inhibits heart formation (Cleutjens et al., 1999; Foley and Mercola, 2005; Salloway, 2003). Consistent with these studies, early treatment of mouse embryonic stem cells with Wnt3a stimulates mesoderm induction whereas late Wnt3a stimulation inhibits cardiac differentiation. Furthermore, the Wnt inhibitors Dickkopf-1 (Dkk-1) and secreted frizzled-related proteins (sFRPs) have been shown to induce cardiac differentiation of stem cells (Cleutjens et al., 1999; Salloway, 2003; Pandur et al., 2002)). Although these studies clearly demonstrate the importance of Wnt signaling in cardiac development, less is known about its role in adult cardiac repair. A recent study using Wnt (axin2-LacZ) reporter mice demonstrated that Wnt signaling is increased post-MI in cardiomyocytes of the border zone and remote area between 7-21 days whereas infiltrating CD45<sup>+</sup> inflammatory cells showed Wnt activation between 3-7 days (Oerlemans et al., 2009). Hence, endogenous activation of the Wnt pathway occurs in the heart in cardiomyocytes and other heart cells and is evident just prior to the initiation of the remodeling phase (day 10-26) of murine infarct repair. The inventors hypothesize that infarct-induced Wnt activation contributes to adverse cardiac remodeling, a process that may be averted by Wnt inhibition. Several recent studies support this hypothesis. Transgenic mice in which \u03b2-catenin was downregulated in an alpha-MHC-restricted manner (i.e. resulting in lower cardiac Wnt signaling) demonstrated favorable ischemic remodeling (Zelaray\u00e0n et al., 2008). Other groups reported functional deterioration after injury in mice expressing a stabilized \u03b2-catenin (i.e. activated Wnt signaling) in cardiomyocytes (Malekar et al., 2010; Baurand et al., 2007). Finally, the inventors and others have shown that mesenchymal stem cells overexpressing sFRP2, a Wnt inhibitor, reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis (Mirotsou et al., 2007; Alfaro et al., 2008).</p>Several antagonists of the Wnt pathways have been characterized (Kawano and Kypta, 2003). One class, including sFRPs, binds and sequesters Wnts to inhibit both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling (Kawano and Kypta, 2003). Fusion of Frizzled8-cysteine rich domain (binds Wnt) to the human Fc domain inhibited Wnt signaling and teratocarcinoma growth in mice but has not been widely used in vivo possibly due to its low in vivo efficacy or issues of selectivity (DeAlmeida et al., 2007). The Dkk class inhibits canonical Wnt signaling by binding to LRP5/LRP6 of the Wnt receptor complex ((Kawano and Kypta, 2003). Recently a novel class of small molecule Wnt inhibitors has been identified that act by inhibiting tankyrase, a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (Chen et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2009). These compounds have not been shown to be effec",
    "the invention, and thus can be considered to constitute preferred modes for its practice. However, those of skill in the art should, in light of the present disclosure, appreciate that many changes can be made in the specific embodiments which are disclosed and still obtain a like or similar result without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>Example 1Pyrvinium Inhibits Wnt Signaling.</p>The inventors developed a biochemical assay using Xenopus laevis egg extract that recapitulates Axin and \u03b2-catenin turnover in response to addition of recombinant Wnt co-receptor (LRP6) (Cselenyi et al., 2008). In Xenopus egg extract, \u03b2-catenin is robustly degraded and Axin is stable. In the presence of LRP6, however, \u03b2-catenin degradation is inhibited and Axin degradation is stimulated. Using this system (with \u03b2-catenin fused to firefly luciferase and Axin fused to Renilla luciferase as reporters for protein levels), they performed a high-throughput screen to identify small molecules that reverse the effects of recombinant LRP6. The inventors identified an FDA-approved antihelminthic compound (pyrvinium) that promotes \u03b2-catenin degradation and inhibits Axin degradation in Xenopus extract. Using a TOPflash reporter cell line (293HEK STF) in which luciferase is under the control of the TCF/Lef1 promoter, the inventors found that pyrvinium inhibits Wnt signaling with an IC<sub>50 </sub>of \u02dc10 nM in contrast to a control compound with a similar structure (Cmpd 211; FIG. 2A). Inhibition of Wnt signaling was further confirmed by real-time RT-PCR of endogenous Wnt target genes, Axin2 and c-MYC (FIG. 2B).</p>Mechanism of Pyrvinium Action.</p>To test whether pyrvinium acts directly on the \u03b2-catenin degradation complex, the inventors assembled an in vitro reaction consisting of purified GSK3, CK1\u03b1, Axin, and \u03b2-catenin and tested the effect of pyrvinum on \u03b2-catenin phosphorylation, a prerequisite for its degradation. Addition of pyrvinium to this system resulted in a dramatic increase in \u03b2-catenin phosphorylation, including sites specific for GSK3 and CK1\u03b1 (FIG. 3A). Pyrvinium enhanced phosphorylation of Tau by CK1\u03b1, but had no observable effect on GSK3 activity (data not shown). To demonstrate specificity for CK1\u03b1, the inventors tested the capacity of pyrvinium to bind and activate representative kinases from major branches of the kinase superfamily. Of the kinases tested, they observed pyrvinium binding and activation of CK1\u03b1 alone (FIG. 3B). If pyrvinium inhibits Wnt signaling via activation of CK1\u03b1, loss of CK1\u03b1 should block the effects of pyrvinium on Wnt signaling. The inventors used a cell line with reduced CK1\u03b1 levels due to inducible expression of shRNA against CK1\u03b1. They found that, in contrast to control cells, pyrvinium failed to inhibit TOPflash activity in shRNA-CK1\u03b1 cells (FIG. 3C). These results indicate that the effects of pyrvinium on Wnt signaling are mediated by its activation of CK1\u03b1.</p>Wnt Inhibition by Pyrvinium Promotes Advanced, Vascularized Granulation Tissue in a Murine Model.</p>The deposition of granulation tissue after wounding is a critical step in tissue regeneration (Inoue et al., 1998). To determine the effect of Wnt inhibition in promoting both the quantity and quality of granulation tissue deposition (Davidson et al., 1985; Li et al., 2005), the inventors implanted polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) sponge discs (isolate granulation tissue from epithelial reformation) subcutaneously beneath the ventral panniculus carnosus in adult mice. Each mouse (n=6) was implanted with four sponges and sacrificed on day 14. Each sponge was injected on day (d) 2, 4, 6 and 8, 10, and 12 with 50 \u03bcl of the following agents reconstituted in PBS/1% albumin: Sponge 1 and 2 received 200 nM pyrvinium, sponge 3 received 200 nM Cmpd 211, and sponge 4 received vehicle alone. A range of pyrivnium doses (25-300 nM) was tested to determine the optimal dose that enhances proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in vitro (data not shown). FIGS. 4A-F is a representative H&amp;E stained section obtained from the same mouse of a sponge receiving pyrvinium or Cmpd 211. Granulation tissue from sponges treated with Cmpd 211 or vehicle (data not shown) exhibited loose, disorganized architecture. In contrast, granulation tissue from pyrvinium-treated sponges exhibited more cellularity and better tissue organization. Vascular density of the granulation tissue was greater in pyrvinium-treated sponges compared to Cmpd 211-treated sponges when histologic sections were assessed by anti-PECAM-1 staining (marks endothelial cells) (FIGS. 4C-E). Cellular proliferation of granulation tissue was assessed by immunostaining for the nuclear protein Ki-67, a marker for proliferation (FIG. 4F). Pyrvinium treatment of PVA sponges resulted in approximately 2.5-fold increase in cell proliferation of the resultant granulation tissue (FIG. 4F).</p>A Single Administration of Pyrvinium Results in Improved Cardiac Remodeling in a Murine Acute Myocardial Infarct Model.</p>Myocardial infarcts were induced in male C57Bl/6 mice by coronary ligation (FIG. 5) as previously described (Alfaro et al., 2008). 30 min post-ligation, the inventors injected 200 nM of pyrvinium or Cmpd 211 at the junction of viable and infarcted tissue. A large number (15) of mice treated with intracardiac pyrvinium experienced lethal toxicity and died within the first 24 hours. Animals that survived beyond the first 48 hours demonstrated similar activity and growth pattern as the control animals. Toxicity associated with pyrvinium was anticipated as IV or IP injection of pyrvinium at levels high enough to achieve Wnt-inhibitory plasma levels resulted in death within 24-48 hours in most mice.</p>Left coronary artery ligation produced infarcts in the anterolateral wall of the LV (FIG. 5). Ventricular remodeling and cardiac functional parameters will be assessed by echo. All four (LVIDD, LVIDS, IVSS, and IVSD) dimensional parameters (as analyzed by percentage difference between days 7 and 30 echo measurements) were smaller in the pyrvinium-treated recipients compared to those receiving Cmpd 211, providing strong support for post-injury Wnt inhibition as a means to prevent adverse chamber remodeling (FIG. 5). In particular, the percent difference between LVIDD, LVIDS were statistically significant (p&lt;0.05). The data set available thus far remains small and additional numbers are necessary. The average difference in fractional shortening of pyrvinium-treated animals between days 7 and 30 was 22.3\u00b15.2 vs 15.4\u00b18.3 (p&lt;0.05). Comparison of infarct size between the two cohorts also did not reflect any statistically significant differences (data not shown). This observation, along with the absence of functional or anatomic difference between the two cohorts at day 7, provides greater evidence that pyrvinium did not acutely affect the extent of the infarct. Because the inventors were limited to a single administration of pyrvinium after injury, they are unable to confidently assess the effect of Wnt inhibition on cardiac function/infarct size.</p>Wnt Inhibition by Pyrvinium Increases Cardiomyoctye Mitosis in the Postmitotic Myocardium.</p>Mammalian cardiomyocytes irreversibly withdraw from the cell cycle soon after birth and undergo terminal differentiation. DNA synthesis, karyokinesis, and cytokinesis do not occur (or occur at very low levels) in adult murine cardiomyocytes 3 weeks after birth (Beinlich and Morgan, 1993; Simpson, 1989). Therefore, cardiac injury causes permanent myocardial loss and cardiac dysfunction. The inventors tested the hypothesis that favorable remodeling mediated by pyrvinium may be through inducing mitosis of adult cardiomyoctyes. Proliferation was assessed by immunostaining for Ki-67. While the numbers of Ki-67-positive cells were similar in the scar of both control Cmpd 211- and pyrvinium-treated animals, in the peri-infarct and, strikingly, in the remote myocardium, the numbers of Ki-67-positive cells were significantly higher in the pyrvinium-treated hearts (FIGS. 6A-D). Phosphorylation of histone 3 (pH3) on Ser10 is an established cellular marker for chromosome condensation during mitotic prophase (van Amerongen and Engel, 2008). The inventors immunostained for pH3 and performed confocal microscopy to assess the effect of Wnt inhibition on the mitotic status of cardiomyocytes. pH3+ (red) cells exhibited a differentiated phenotype as indicated by striations and expression of \u03b1-sarcomeric actin (green). Reconstruction of optical sections enabled us to assign pH3-positive nuclei unequivocally to cardiomyocytes (side panel). Importantly, pyrvinium did not induce myocyte proliferation in sham-operated animals that received a single intramyocardial injection into LV apex (data not shown).</p>Summary.</p>These data show that pyrvinium, a potent and specific small molecule inhibitor of canonical Wnt signaling, promoted better organized and vascularized granulation tissue in vivo compared to control. The inventors show that mice treated with peri-infarct intramuscular administration of pyrvinium demonstrated significantly more favorable LV remodeling 30 d post-MI compared to a control compound. Remarkably, this effect was observed after only a single dose of intramuscular administration of the Wnt inhibitor following injury. These data further suggest that the cellular basis of Wnt-inhibitor-mediated remodeling is, in part, due to induction of myocyte mitosis. These findings highlight the potential of Wnt inhibition to treat MI and the need for a safe and effective therapeutic Wnt inhibitor to better dissect the effect of Wnt inhibition on cardiac repair and regeneration.</p>Example 2Development of an Anti-LRP5/6 Antibody that Acts as a Potent Inhibitor of Canonical Wnt Signaling In Vitro.</p>Although the Wnt coreceptors, LRP5/6, are required for canonical Wnt signaling, they are not believed to be required for non-canonical signaling (Angers and Moon, 2009). In order to generate monoclonal antibodies against LRP5/6, three 15 kDa fragments encoding evolutionarily conserved domains of human LRP6 (also conserved in LRP5) were expressed and purified from bacteria. Recombinant proteins were used to inoculate BALB/c mice. Hybridoma lines were initially screened by ELISA for reactivity, and positive lines (1,500 clones) were tested for their ability to inhibit Wnt3a-mediated activation of the Wnt pathway using the TOPflash reporter cell line. Approximately 150 cell lines were identified that produced antibodies with anti-Wnt signaling activity. Nearly all of these lines were unstable, however, and failed to produce inhibitory antibodies over time. One line, mabLRP5/6, was stable and was further characterized. mabLRP5/6 was were found to blocked nuclear accumulation of \u03b2-catenin in response to Wnt3a and to inhibit Wnt signaling with an IC<sub>50 </sub>\u02dc200 pg/ml (FIG. 7; data not shown).</p>mabLRP5/6 Inhibits Canonical Wnt Signaling In Vivo and Induces Cardiomyoctye Mitosis Post-MI.</p>To evaluate whether mabLRP5/6 inhibits Wnt-mediated transcription in vivo, the inventors injected 3 groups of mice IV with increasing amounts of mabLRP5/6 (2.3 \u03bcg, 4.7 \u03bcg or 9.4 \u03bcg, n=3 in each group) or control IgM. Mice were sacrificed after 48 hours and serum and tissue samples were obtained. Plasma (50 \u03bcl) from mice treated with 4.7 and 9.4 \u03bcg of mabLRP5/6 (FIGS. 8A-D, only 9.4 \u03bcg shown) inhibited Wnt signaling in the TOPflash reporter cell line (in contrast to control) at 48 and 72 hours to varying but significant degrees. To determine if IV treatment with mabLRP5/6 resulted in Wnt-inhibitory effects in heart tissue, the inventors assessed transcript levels of the Wnt target genes, Axin 2 and Cyclin D that are upregulated by canonical Wnt signaling (hence Wnt inhibition should decrease transcript levels). Heart tissues from treated animals were homogenized and total RNA isolated for real time RT-PCR analysis (Young et al., 2005). Both Axin2 and Cyclin D transcripts were downregulated \u02dc2-fold in the hearts of mabLRP5/6-treated animals at 48 hours. The effect on Axin 2 transcript persisted at 72 hours after a single administration. To obtain evidence that mabLRP5/6 has cellular effects on post-MI myocardium, the inventors analyzed by immuno-histology paraffin-embedded sections from male mice treated with either IgM or mabLRP5/6 12 hours prior to induction of acute MI and then sacrificed 14 days later (n=1 for each condition). They identified &gt;3-fold higher Ki-67<sup>+</sup> and pH3<sup>+</sup> cells in the remote LV from the mabLRP5/6-treated mouse compared to the control IgM-treated mouse (FIGS. 8C-D).</p>Preliminary Studies Show Improved Myocardial Ventricular Function and Adverse Remodeling with Post-Infarct High Dose mMABLRP5/6.</p>The Inventors Initiated Studies to determine the effectiveness of mMABLRP5/6 on repair and regeneration of injured myocardium using an mouse acute myocardial infarct model. Myocardial infarcts were induced in 8-week old male C57B1/6 mice (30-31 kg) by coronary ligation (FIG. 9) as previously described (Alfaro et al., 2008). At the time of infarction, the inventors administered 10 \u03bcg or 20 \u03bcg of mabLRP5/6 in 100 \u03bcl PBS or the same amount of IgM as control, intravenously by tail vein injection. The mice received a second dose of mabLRP5/6 or control antibody 72 hours after infarct to maintain at least 50% Wnt inhibition activity in the plasma through 7 days post infarct (data not shown). Ventricular remodeling and cardiac function were analyzed by echocardiography pre-infarct and at 7 and 30 days post MI. Ventricular function was reflected by ejection fraction (EF). LV internal dimension diastolic (LVIDD) and LV internal dimension systolic (LVIDS) reflected remodeling of the infarcted ventricle (FIG. 1). The percentage difference in LVIDD between day 7 and day 30 showed a dose-dependent trend towards less adverse remodeling in animals receiving when compared with the control IgM; 5.36\u00b10.83 (high dose) as compared to 6.23\u00b12.3 (low dose) vs. 10.9\u00b15.79 (IgM). Additionally, the percentage difference in LVIDS between day 7 and day 30 was reduced in a dose-dependent manner in animals treated with 20 \u03bcg of mMABLRP5/6 when compared with 10 \u03bcg dose or control IgM. During this time, EF also decreased less in the high dose mabLRP5/6-treated animals, whereas those treated with low dose or IgM control exhibited similar decrease (\u22126%). The data set available thus far remains too small to demonstrate statistical significance. However, these data show a dose-dependent trend in mice receiving mabLRP5/6 towards both improved ventricular function and remodeling parameters. These data look promising and support the inventors' hypothesis that pharmacologic Wnt inhibition using mabLRP5/6 prevents adverse remodeling and preserves ventricular function. Additional numbers of animals as well as histologic myocardial analysis and high-resolution visual sonics studies are pending to determine infarct size and elucidate effects of mabLRP5/6 on endogenous cellular myocardial repair.</p>Feasibility of isolating sufficient numbers of viable cardiomyocytes from infarct border zone as well remote myocardium post infarct. Myocardial infarction were induced in mice as described above. Infarcted mice were sacrificed 4 months later and the hearts removed for myocyte isolation. The tissue in the area around the infarct, which included 2 mm of muscle form the scar, was dissected and designated \u201cborder zone.\u201d The area distant to the infarct was designated \u201cremote zone\u201d; both tissues were processed to isolate viable cardiomyocytes as previously reported (Knollmann et al.; 2003). The myocyte yield was around 40% intact myocytes from the borderzone tissue, and higher (50-70%) from the remote tissue. Immunoblot for tubulin showed a significant reduction in tubulin protein in the borderzone myocytes compared to the remote myocytes (Knollmann et al.; 2003). Isolated myocytes were fixed with a solution containing paraformaldehide (final concentration 2%), and permeabilized with Triton-X (0.01%). After that, the cells were resuspended in PBS azide and kept at 4\u00b0 C. until they were imaged (FIGS. 10A-B). These data demonstrate the capability to isolate sufficient numbers of viable, adult cardiomyocytes from distinct anatomical areas following experimental infarction.</p>Summary.</p>These studies indicate that inhibition of Wnt signaling by injection of pyrvinium promotes better-vascularized wound repair tissue. The inventors show that administration of pyrvinium post-MI promoted left ventricular remodeling and stimulated cardiomyocyte proliferation only in infarcted hearts. Hence, Wnt signaling is likely activated in a subset of cardiomyocytes following MI. To date, there are no drugs or biologics in the clinic that inhibit the Wnt pathway. In vivo toxicity associated with currently available small molecule inhibitors (including pyrvinium) of the Wnt pathway is a major limitation in the ability to test their therapeutic potential (Chen et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2009). Thus, development of mabLRP5/6 as a potent in vivo Wnt inhibitor with minimal toxicity represents a major breakthrough. These data indicate that pretreatment with mabLRP5/6 signficantly induced cardiomyocyte mitosis after infarct. The inventors thus predict that Wnt inhibition by mabLRP5/6 will enhance cardiac repair and regeneration following MI.</p>The inventors examined effects of antibodies on Wnt signaling activated by recombinant Wnt3a, which was added to the media, and effects of antibodies on Wnt signaling in a colorectal cancer line (SW480) that has constitutively active Wnt signaling due to a mutation in the tumor suppressor, APC. They found that antibodies were able to inhibit Wnt signaling in both cases (FIGS. 11A-B). This was unexpected because the APC mutation is downstream of the LRP6 receptor, to which the antibody is directed. This finding suggests that antibodies against LRP6 could be used to treat colorectal cancers with mutations in APC, which are found in \u02dc80 of all colorectal cancers. As a control, the inventors have also used lithium activation, which activates the pathway downstream of the receptor and in a different manner, and the antibody does not inhibit Wnt signaling.</p>All of the compositions and methods disclosed and claimed herein can be made and executed without undue experimentation in light of the present disclosure.
