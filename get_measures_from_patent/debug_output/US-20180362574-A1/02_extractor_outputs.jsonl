{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that contain all four required components: a specific molecule name, ID or other identifier, a bioactivity metric, a specific numeric value for that metric, and a unit for that value. The text appears to be a patent application that describes the background and invention related to polycystic kidney disease (PKD) and polycystic liver disease (PLD), but it does not provide specific bioactivity data that meets the required criteria."}
{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that meet the specified criteria. The text does not contain specific molecule names, IDs, or identifiers along with bioactivity metrics, numeric values, and units. The text appears to be descriptive of general concepts and terms related to chemistry and biology, but does not provide specific data or measurements."}
{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that meet the specified criteria in the provided text snippet. The text appears to describe general methods and compositions, but does not include specific molecule names, bioactivity metrics, numeric values, and units as required."}
{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that meet the specified criteria. The text does not contain specific molecule names, bioactivity metrics, numeric values, and units that are required for a sentence to be considered relevant."}
{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that meet the specified criteria. The text does not contain specific molecule names, bioactivity metrics, numeric values, and units that are required to be extracted. The text appears to be a general description of pharmaceutical compositions, kits, and methods of treatment, without providing specific data or measurements."}

{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that meet the specified criteria, as none of the sentences contain a specific molecule name, a bioactivity metric, a numeric value, and a unit. The text primarily discusses the effects of compounds I-1 and 1-3 on various biological processes, but does not provide specific bioactivity metrics with numeric values and units."}
