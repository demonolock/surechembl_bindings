In various embodiments, the concentration of mTOR inhibitor required to reduce mTOR enzymatic activity is less than about 1 \u03bcM, less than about 500 nM, less than about 100 nM, less than about 50 nM, or less than about 10 nM.</p>In some embodiments, such inhibition is selective, i.e., the mTOR inhibitor reduces the ability of mTOR to phosphorylate a substrate peptide or protein at a concentration that is lower than the concentration of the inhibitor that is required to produce another, unrelated biological effect, e.g., reduction of the enzymatic activity of a different kinase. In some embodiments, the mTOR inhibitor also reduces the enzymatic activity of another kinase, preferably one that is implicated in cancer.</p>In some embodiments, the mTOR inhibitor selectively inhibits both mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity relative to one or more type I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3-kinase) as ascertained by a cell-based assay or an in vitro kinase assay.</p>The phrase \u201can mTORC1/2 inhibitor\u201d when used: herein refers to a catalytic mTOR inhibitor that interacts with and reduces the kinase activity of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes. In some embodiments of the methods of the invention, the mTOR inhibitor binds to and directly inhibits both mTORC1 and mTORC2. For example, the mTOR inhibitor inhibits both mTORC1 and mTORC2 with an IC50 value of about 500 nM or less, 400 nM or less, 300 nM or less, 200 nM or less, 100 nM or less, 50 nM or less, 10 nM or less, or 1 nM or less, as ascertained in an in vitro kinase assay. In another embodiment, the mTOR inhibitor inhibits both mTORC1 and mTORC2 with an IC50 value of about 10 nM or less as ascertained in an in vitro kinase assay, and the mTOR inhibitor is substantially inactive against one or more types I PI3-kinases selected from the group consisting of PI3-kinase \u03b1, PI3-kinase \u03b2, PI3-kinase \u03b3, and PI3-kinase \u03b4. Alternatively, the mTOR inhibitor inhibits both mTORC1 and mTORC2 with an IC50 value of about 100 nM or less as ascertained in an in vitro kinase assay, and the IC50 value is at least 2, 5 or 10 times less than its IC50 value against all other type I PI3-kinases selected from the group consisting of PI3-kinase \u03b1, PI3-kinase \u03b2, PI3-kinase \u03b3, and PI3-kinase \u03b4.</p>As used herein, the term \u201cAurora A kinase\u201d refers to a serine/threonine kinases involved in mitotic progression. Aurora A kinase is also known as AIK, ARK1, AURA, BTAK, STK6, STK7, STK15, AURORA2, MGC34538, and AURKA. A variety of cellular proteins that play a role in cell division are substrates for phosphorylation by the Aurora A kinase enzyme, including, without limitation, p53, TPX-2, XIEg5 (in Xenopus), and D-TACC (in Drosophila). The Aurora A kinase enzyme is also itself a substrate for autophosphorylation, e.g., at Thr288. Preferably, the Aurora A kinase is a human Aurora A kinase.</p>The term \u201cinhibitor of Aurora A kinase\u201d or \u201cAurora A kinase inhibitor\u201d is used to signify a compound that is capable of interacting with Aurora A kinase and inhibiting its enzymatic activity. Inhibiting Aurora A kinase enzymatic activity means reducing the ability of Aurora A kinase to phosphorylate a substrate peptide or protein. In various embodiments, such reduction of Aurora A kinase activity is at least about 75%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, or at least about 99%. In various embodiments, the concentration of Aurora A kinase inhibitor required to reduce an Aurora A kinase enzymatic activity is less than about 1 \u03bcM, less than about 500 nM, less than about 100 nM, less than about 50 nM, or less than about 10 nM.

Therefore, single stereochemical isomers as well as enantiomeric and diastereomeric mixtures of the present compounds are within the scope of the invention.</p>Exemplary mTORC1/2 Inhibitor Compounds</p>Any molecule capable of inhibiting the enzymatic activity of mTORC1 and mTORC2 may be used in the methods, pharmaceutical compositions, and kits of the present invention. mTORC1/2 inhibitors can be assayed in vitro or in vivo for their ability to selectively bind to and/or inhibit mTORC1 and mTORC2. In vitro assays include assays to determine selective inhibition of the ability of mTORC1 and mTORC2 to phosphorylate a substrate protein or peptide. Alternate in vitro assays quantitate the ability of the compound to selectively bind to mTORC1 and mTORC2. Selective inhibitor binding may be measured by radiolabelling the inhibitor prior to binding, isolating the inhibitor/mTOR complex and determining the amount of radiolabel bound. Alternatively, selective inhibitor binding may be determined by running a competition experiment in which new inhibitors are incubated with mTOR bound to a known radioligand. The compounds also can be assayed for their ability to affect cellular or physiological functions mediated by mTOR activity. Assays for each of these activities are known in the art.</p>In some embodiments of the methods of the invention, the mTORC1/2 inhibitor inhibits both mTORC1 and mTORC2 with an IC50 value of about 500 nM or less, 400 nM or less, 300 nM or less, 200 nM or less, 100 nM or less, 50 nM or less, 10 nM or less, or 1 nM or less, as ascertained in an in vitro kinase assay.

    "e points were marked as outliers and removed from the analysis. The remaining data was then fit a second time. Based on the fitted response surface, plots of constant viability, called isobolograms, were produced. The contours within the isobolograms ranged from 90% to 10% Viability, with a separation of 10% in viability.</p>Quality Checks.</p>Three types of quality checks were applied to the plates. First, it was checked that the variation of the positive controls and the mean of the negative controls were small. Next, it was checked that the new data agreed with data from previous single drug experiments. Finally, the residuals from the response surface fit were analyzed to ensure that the residual sum of squares was sufficiently small. All of these quality checks were based on numerical thresholds to make pass/fail decisions, and the same thresholds were used for all of the plates in the experiment. If a plate failed any one of the quality checks, it was removed from the analysis.</p>Measuring Synergy.</p>The Combination Index (M. C. Berenbaum, J. Theor. Biol., 1985, 114, 413-431) and Nonlinear Blending (J. J Peterson and S. J. Novik, Journal of Receptors and Signal Transduction, 2007, 27:125-146) were used as measures of drug synergy. The Combination Index is computed based on an isobologram, which is a slice of the dose response surface with constant viability. For the present analysis, the 50% isobologram, which is the dose contour that has 50% viability, was used. The EC50<sub>A </sub>and EC50<sub>B </sub>are defined be the respective doses of drugs A and B alone that have a viability of 50%. For a point (D<sub>A</sub>, D<sub>B</sub>) along the 50% isobologram, the Combination Index is defined as (D<sub>A</sub>/EC50<sub>A</sub>)+(D<sub>B</sub>/EC50<sub>B</sub>). Since the choice of (D<sub>A</sub>, D<sub>B</sub>) can be arbitrary, the constraint D<sub>A</sub>/D<sub>B</sub>=EC50<sub>A</sub>/EC50<sub>B </sub>was used.</p>In some cases, the Combination Index cannot be computed because the EC50<sub>A </sub>or EC50<sub>B </sub>does not exist. In such cases, Nonlinear Blending could be used as an alternative measure of synergy. Nonlinear Blending is found by considering a slice of the dose response surface that intersects both concentration axes and runs parallel to the viability axis. Let V<sub>A </sub>and V<sub>B </sub>be the viability where the slice intersects the drug A and B axes, respectively. Let V<sub>max </sub>and V<sub>min </sub>be the maximum and minimum viabilities along the slice. Let\n\nNLB<sub>S</sub>=min(V<sub>A</sub>,V<sub>B</sub>)\u2212V<sub>min </sub>\n\nNLB<sub>A</sub>=V<sub>max</sub>\u2212max(V<sub>A</sub>,V<sub>B</sub>)\n\nDefine the Nonlinear Blending value to be NLB<sub>S </sub>if NLB<sub>S</sub>&gt;NLB<sub>A </sub>and \u2212NLB<sub>A </sub>otherwise. Since the choice of the slice is arbitrary, the slice between the EC50 values (or the highest dose values, if the EC50s did not exist) of each drug alone was chosen. The standard error for both the Combination Index and the Nonlinear Blending were found using the Cramer-Rao lower bound (H Cramer, 1946. Mathematical Methods of Statistics; C. R. Rao, Bulletin of the Calcutta Mathematical Society, 1945, 37: 81-89).\n</p>Summarizing Replicates.</p>After completing the analysis of individual plates, the results were combined across the replicates. For a given synergy measure and a set of replicates, the overall mean and standard error were computed using weighted averaging. A null mean, which corresponded to an additive effect, was then compared with the overall mean. The null mean was 1 for the Combination Index and 0 for Nonlinear Blending. Next, a two sized Z-test was performed based on the estimated mean and standard error. This produced a p-value for each synergy measure and each cell line.</p>After computing the mean, standard error, and p-value for each set of replicates, these values required interpretation. Thus, a standard procedure was created to produce a call (synergy, additivity, subadditivity, antagonism, or inconclusive) in each case. If the Combination Index existed for more than half of the replicates, then these measures were used to make the call. If the Combination Index did not exist for a majority of the replicates, then a similar procedure based on Nonlinear Blending was used to make the call. When the p-value is greater t"
