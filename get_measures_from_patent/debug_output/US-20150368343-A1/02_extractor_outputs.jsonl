However, they do contain a bioactivity metric (KD) and a specific numeric value with a unit (M). \n\nIf you would like to extract sentences with a specific molecule name or ID, such as CDH19, here are a few examples:\n\n* Whether a binding domain specifically reacts with or binds to a target can be tested readily by, inter alia, comparing the reaction of said binding domain with a target protein or antigen with the reaction of said binding domain with proteins or antigens other than CDH19 or CD3.\n* Preferably, a binding domain of the invention does not essentially bind or is not capable of binding to proteins or antigens other than CDH19 or CD3 (i.e. the first binding domain is not capable of binding to proteins other than CDH19 and the second binding domain is not capable of binding to proteins other than CD3).\n* The term \u201cdoes not essentially bind\u201d, or \u201cis not capable of binding\u201d means that a binding domain of the present invention does not bind another protein or antigen other than CDH19 or CD3, i.e., does not show reactivity of more than 30%, preferably not more than 20%, more preferably not more than 10%, particularly preferably not more than 9%, 8%, 7%, 6% or 5% with proteins or antigens other than CDH19 or CD3, whereby binding to CDH19 or CD3, respectively, is set to be 100%.\n\nHowever, these sentences do not contain a specific numeric value with a unit for a bioactivity metric."}
