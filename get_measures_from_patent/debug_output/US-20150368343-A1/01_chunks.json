Moreover, the provided examples describe a further method to characterize a given binding domain by way of binning, which includes a test whether the given binding domain binds to one or more epitope cluster(s) of a given protein, in particular CDH19.</p>As used herein, the term \u201cepitope cluster\u201d denotes the entirety of epitopes lying in a defined contiguous stretch of an antigen. An epitope cluster can comprise one, two or more epitopes. The concept of epitope cluster is also used in the characterization of the features of the antibody constructs of the invention.</p>The terms \u201c(capable of) binding to\u201d, \u201cspecifically recognizing\u201d, \u201cdirected to\u201d and \u201creacting with\u201d mean in accordance with this invention that a binding domain is capable of specifically interacting with one or more, preferably at least two, more preferably at least three and most preferably at least four amino acids of an epitope.</p>As used herein, the terms \u201cspecifically interacting\u201d, \u201cspecifically binding\u201d or \u201cspecifically bind(s)\u201d mean that a binding domain exhibits appreciable affinity for a particular protein or antigen and, generally, does not exhibit significant reactivity with proteins or antigens other than CDH19 or CD3. \u201cAppreciable affinity\u201d includes binding with an affinity of about 10<sup>\u22126</sup>M (KD) or stronger. Preferably, binding is considered specific when binding affinity is about 10<sup>\u221212 </sup>to 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, 10<sup>\u221212 </sup>to 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>M, 10<sup>\u221212 </sup>to 10<sup>\u221210 </sup>M, 10<sup>\u221211 </sup>to 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, preferably of about 10<sup>\u221211 </sup>to 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>M. Whether a binding domain specifically reacts with or binds to a target can be tested readily by, inter alia, comparing the reaction of said binding domain with a target protein or antigen with the reaction of said binding domain with proteins or antigens other than CDH19 or CD3. Preferably, a binding domain of the invention does not essentially bind or is not capable of binding to proteins or antigens other than CDH19 or CD3 (i.e. the first binding domain is not capable of binding to proteins other than CDH19 and the second binding domain is not capable of binding to proteins other than CD3).</p>The term \u201cdoes not essentially bind\u201d, or \u201cis not capable of binding\u201d means that a binding domain of the present invention does not bind another protein or antigen other than CDH19 or CD3, i.e., does not show reactivity of more than 30%, preferably not more than 20%, more preferably not more than 10%, particularly preferably not more than 9%, 8%, 7%, 6% or 5% with proteins or antigens other than CDH19 or CD3, whereby binding to CDH19 or CD3, respectively, is set to be 100%.</p>Specific binding is believed to be effected by specific motifs in the amino acid sequence of the binding doma",

As set forth above, the antibody construct of the invention exhibiting cross-species specificity described herein can be advantageously used in identical form in preclinical testing in non-chimpanzee primates and as drug in humans. These compositions can also be administered in combination with other proteinaceous and non-proteinaceous drugs. These drugs may be administered simultaneously with the composition comprising the polypeptide of the invention as defined herein or separately before or after administration of said polypeptide in timely defined intervals and doses. The dosage regimen will be determined by the attending physician and clinical factors.
