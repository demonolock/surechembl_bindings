    " results clearly demonstrate a surprising and extraordinarily efficient binding of two distinctly different toxins upon enzyme activation. The large differential in activity indicates the viability of delivering a stable polyphenol perhydrate for localized and aggessive remote activation by tissues, tissue conditions, or pathogens that express peroxidase enzymes or other site specific enzymes utilizing hydrogen peroxide or its decomposition products as a reaction promoting substrate.</p>Example 4. Data showing that an increase in bound H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>on Chinese Gall results in a higher inhibitory activity of the Chinese GallSample A, which contained 100 mg of Chinese gall (Sigma Aldrich, Chinese Gall) dissolved in 100 ml of 10% hydrogen peroxide, then diluted to a total volume of 1000 ml was compared against Sample B, which contained 1 mg of Chinese gall dissolved in 100 ml of 0.1% hydrogen peroxide (a dilution of the 10% hydrogen peroxide by 100x) and was then also diluted to 1000 ml. Due to the dilution, the molarity of the diluted hydrogen peroxide was 1/100 of the sample A solution, such that 100x less H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was available to bind with the Chinese gall. It was suspected that a proportionally lower amount of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> would be bound on Sample A as compared to Sample B. To compare the relative effects of the different amounts of available H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, the activity of the two binding systems was compared using a binding assay. Sample A had a higher inhibition effect, showing that the higher amount of available H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> resulted in a higher activity of the phenolic compound in the binding system.</p>Example 5. Data showing treatment of diarrheaData has shown that the binding systems can protect, improve, maintain or restore body homeostasis, especially gastrointestinal health. The binding systems provide antisecretory, anti-infective, anti-pathogenic, anti-adhesion, anti-allergenic and anti-toxin functions; as well as promote a localized tissue barrier formation, tissue healing, gross permeability reduction, astringency, and a restoration of hemeostasis.</p>This example illustrates how the binding systems can restore gastrointestinal health through these overlapping damage specific functions to synergistically defeat pathogen defenses without involving typical antibiotic resistance mechanisms. The binding system was shown to provide a highly effective resolution of infections and the disruption of homeostasis caused by a microbial diarrhea.</p>In a double blind test, 86 human subjects suffering from moderate to severe acute diarrhea. The subjects were given either a binding system or placebo on the first day, and then the opposite on the next day. The binding system contained less than 5 milligram dry weight equivalent of a binding system of a mixture of pomegranate and green tea extracts with hydrogen peroxide. The time to resolution (last loose stool) was 7 hours w"
