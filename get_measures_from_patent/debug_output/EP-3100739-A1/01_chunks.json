    " describes the use of fusogenic liposomes to deliver a protein to cells both in vivo and in vitro.</p>Dosage, toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the therapeutic agents can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compounds which exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred. While compounds that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such compounds to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects.</p>The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the methods, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initiaHy from cell culture assays. A dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.</p>Typically, an effective amount of the aromatic-cationic peptides, sufficient for achieving a therapeutic or prophylactic effect, range from about 0.000001 mg per kilogram body weight per day to about 10,000 mg per kilogram body weight per day. Suitably, the dosage ranges are from about 0.0001 mg per kilogram body weight per day to about 100 mg per kilogram body weight per day. For example dosages can be 1 mg/kg body weight or 10 mg/kg body weight every day, every two days or every three days or within the range of 1-10 mg/kg every week, every two weeks or every three weeks. In one embodiment, a single dosage of peptide ranges from 0.1-10,000 micrograms per kg body weight. In one embodiment, aromatic-cationic peptide concentrations in a carrier range from 0.2 to 2000 micrograms per delivered milliliter. An exemplary treatment regime entails administration once per day or once a week. In therapeutic applications, a relatively high dosage at relatively short intervals is sometimes required until progression of the disease is reduced or terminated, and preferably until the subject shows partial or complete amelioration of symptoms of disease. Thereafter, the patient can be a",

The myocardial protective effect of the peptide D-Arg-2'6'-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH<sub>2</sub> were demonstrated by this Example.</p>Experimental MethodsNew Zealand white rabbits were used in this study. The rabbits were males and &gt;10 weeks in age. Environmental controls in the animal rooms were set to maintain temperatures of 61\u00b0 to 72\u00b0F and relative humidity between 30% and 70%. Room temperature and humidity were recorded hourly, and monitored daily. There were approximately 10 - 15 air exchanges per hour in the animal rooms. Photoperiod was 12-hr light/12-hr dark (via fluorescent lighting) with exceptions as necessary to accommodate dosing and data collection. Routine daily observations were performed. Harlan Teklad, Certified Diet (2030C), rabbit diet was provided approximately 180 grams per day from arrival to the facility. In addition, fresh fruits and vegetables were given to the rabbit 3 times a week.</p>The peptide D-Arg-2'6'-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH<sub>2</sub> (sterile lyophilized powder) was used as the test article. Dosing solutions were formulated at no more than 1 mg/ml, and were delivered via continuous infusion (IV) at a constant rate (e.g., 50 \u00b5L/kg/min). Normal saline (0.9% NaCl) was used as a control.</p>The test/vehicle articles were given intravenously, under general anesthesia, in order to mimic the expected route of administration in the clinical setting of AMI and PTCA. Intravenous infusion was administered via a peripheral vein using a Kd Scientific infusion pump (Holliston, MA 01746) at a constant volume (e.g., 50 \u00b5L/kg/min).</p>The study followed a predetermined placebo and sham controlled design. In short, 10-20 healthy, acclimatized, male rabbits were assigned to one of three study arms (approximately 2-10 animals per group). Arm A (n = 10, CTRL/PLAC) includes animals treated with vehicle (vehicle; VEH, IV); Arm B (n =10, treated) includes animals treated with peptide; Arm C (n = 2, SHAM) includes sham-operated time-controls treated with vehicle (vehicle; VEH, IV) or peptide.\nTable 7.

In all cases, cardiovascular function was monitored both prior to and during ischemia, as well as for up to 180 min (3 h) post-reperfusion. The experiments were terminated 3 h post-reperfusion (end of study); irreversible myocardial injury (infarct size by histomorphometery) at this time-point was evaluated, and was the primary-end-point of the study.
