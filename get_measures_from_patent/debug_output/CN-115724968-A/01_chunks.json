    "ors, neuropilins (NRPs), and Heparin Sulfate Proteoglycans (HSPGs). Tyrosine kinase receptors include VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and VEGFR3, with VEGFR2 being the major receptor tyrosine kinase receptor that mediates angiogenesis. VEGF activation of VEGFR2 promotes mitosis of vascular endothelial cells and increased vascular permeability, thereby promoting sprouting of new blood vessels. Thus, without being bound by theory, targeting VEGF or VEGFR2 can be effective in inhibiting abnormal angiogenesis (Ferrara, n. (2010)). The amino acid sequence of human-VEGFR 2 (Ala 20-Glu 764) is shown in SEQ ID NO 3.</p><p id=\"p0093\" num=\"0089\">The term \"immunoglobulin single variable domain\" or \"ISV\" as used herein is generally defined herein as an amino acid sequence that: which comprises an immunoglobulin fold or is capable of forming an immunoglobulin fold (i.e., by folding) under suitable conditions (e.g., physiological conditions), i.e., thereby forming an immunoglobulin variable domain (e.g., a VH, VL, or VHH domain); and forming (or under suitable conditions being capable of forming) an immunoglobulin variable domain that comprises a functional antigen binding site (in the sense that it does not require interaction with another immunoglobulin variable domain, such as a VH-VL interaction, to form a functional antigen binding site).</p><p id=\"p0094\" num=\"0090\">The term \"Ka\" as used herein is intended to refer to the association rate of a particular antibody-antigen interaction, while the term \"Kd\" as used herein is intended to refer to the dissociation rate of a particular antibody-antigen interaction. As used herein, the term \"KD\" or \"KD value\" is intended to mean the dissociation constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction, which is derived from the Kd and the KaThe ratio (i.e., kd/Ka) was obtained and expressed as molar concentration (M). The KD value of an antibody can be determined using well established methods in the art. A preferred method for determining the KD value of an antibody is by using surface plasmon resonance, preferably using a biosensor system such asAnd (4) a system.</p><p id=\"p0095\" num=\"0091\">The term \"specific binding\" or \"specifically binds to\" as used herein refers to a non-random binding reaction between two molecules, e.g., between an antibody and an antigen.</p><p id=\"p0096\" num=\"0092\">As used herein, the ability to \"inhibit binding,\" \"block binding,\" or \"compete for the same epitope\" refers to the ability of an antibody to inhibit the binding of two molecules to any detectable degree. In some embodiments, an antibody that blocks binding between two molecules inhibits the binding interaction between the two molecules by at least 50%. In some embodiments, the inhibition may be greater than 60%, greater than 70%, greater than 80%, or greater than 90%.</p><p id=\"p0097\" num=\"0093\">The term \"high affinity\" antibody as used herein refers to an antibody having 1X 10 to the target antigen <sup>-7</sup> M or less, more preferably 5X 10 <sup>-8</sup> M or less, even more preferably 1X 10 <sup>-8</sup> M or less, even more preferably 5X 10 <sup>-9</sup> M or less, and even more preferably 1X 10 <sup>-9</sup> M or lower KD value.</p><p id=\"p0098\" num=\"0094\">The term \"IC50\", also referred to as \"half inhibitory concentration\", as used herein, refers to the concentration of inhibitor (e.g., VEGF antibody) required for 50% inhibition of a target, e.g., an enzyme, cell, receptor, cytokine, etc.</p><p id=\"p0099\" num=\"0095\">As used herein, the term \"isolated\" refers to the state of a substance or component that is obtained by artificial means from a natural state. An \"isolated\" substance or component, if it occurs in nature, may be due to a change in the natural environment in which it is found, or the separation of the substance or component from its natural environment, or both. For example, an un-isolated polynucleotide or polypeptide naturally occurs in a living animal, and the same high purity polynucleotide or polypeptide isolated from that natural state is referred to as an isolated polynucleotide or polypeptide. The term \"isolated\" neither excludes mixed artificial or synthetic substances nor other impurities which do not affect the activity of the isolated substance.</p><p id=\"p0100\" num=\"0096\">As used herein, the term \"isolated antibody\" refers to an antibody that is substantially free of other antibodies having different antigenic specificities. Furthermore, the isolated antibody may be substantially free of other cellular material and/or chemicals.</p><p id=\"p0101\" num=\"0097\">As used herein, the term \"vector\" refers to a nucleic acid vehicle into which a polynucleotide may be inserted.
