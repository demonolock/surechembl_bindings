    "iation or union of a binding protein (e.g., TCR receptor) or a binding domain (or fusion protein thereof) to a target molecule with an affinity or K<sub>a </sub>(i.e., an equilibrium association constant of a particular binding interaction with units of 1/M) equal to or greater than 10<sup>5 </sup>M<sup>\u22121 </sup>(which equals the ratio of the on-rate [k<sub>on</sub>] to the off-rate [k<sub>off</sub>] for this association reaction), while not significantly associating or uniting with any other molecules or components in a sample. Binding proteins or binding domains (or fusion proteins thereof) may be classified as \u201chigh affinity\u201d binding proteins or binding domains (or fusion proteins thereof) or as \u201clow affinity\u201d binding proteins or binding domains (or fusion proteins thereof). \u201cHigh affinity\u201d binding proteins or binding domains refer to those binding proteins or binding domains having a K<sub>a </sub>of at least 10<sup>7 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>, at least 10<sup>8 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>, at least 10<sup>9 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>, at least 10<sup>10 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>, at least 10<sup>11 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>, at least 10<sup>12 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>, or at least 10<sup>13 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>. Low affinity\u201d binding proteins or binding domains refer to those binding proteins or binding domains having a K<sub>a </sub>of up to 10<sup>7 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>, up to 10<sup>6 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>, up to 10<sup>5 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>. Alternatively, affinity can be defined as an equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) of a particular binding interaction with units of M (e.g., 10<sup>\u22125 </sup>M to 10<sup>\u221213 </sup>M).</p>In certain embodiments, a receptor or binding domain may have \u201cenhanced affinity,\u201d which refers to selected or engineered receptors or binding domains with stronger binding to a target antigen than a wild type (or parent) binding domain. For example, enhanced affinity may be due to a K<sub>a </sub>(equilibrium association constant) for the target antigen that is higher than the wild type binding domain, due to a K<sub>d </sub>(dissociation constant) for the target antigen that is less than that of the wild type binding domain, due to an off-rate (k<sub>off</sub>) for the target antigen that is less than that of the wild type binding domain, or a combination thereof. In certain embodiments, enhanced affinity TCRs can be codon optimized to enhance expression in a particular host cell, such as a cell of the immune system, a inducible pluripotent stem cell (iPSC), a hematopoietic stem cell, a T cell, a primary T cell, a T cell line, a NK cell, or a natural killer T cell (Scholten et al, Clin. Immunol. 119: 135, 2006). The T cell can be a CD4+ or a CD8+ T cell, or gamma-delta T cell.</p>As used herein, the term \u201cBob1 antigen\u201d or \u201cBob1 peptide antigen\u201d or \u201cBob1-containing peptide antigen\u201d refers to a naturally or synthetically produced peptide portion of a Bob1 protein ranging in length from about 7 amino acids, about 8 amino acids, about 9 amino acids, about 10 amino acids, up to about 20 amino acids, which can form a complex with a MHC (e.g., HLA) molecule, and a binding protein of this disclosure specific for a Bob1 peptide:MHC (e.g., HLA) complex can specifically bind to such as complex. Typically, for the purposes of this disclosure, the Bob1 peptide antigen comprises or consists of the sequence of SEQ ID NO:5 and the Bob1 peptide antigen:HLA complex comprises SEQ ID NO:5:HLA*B35:01).</p>The term \u201c Bob1-specific binding protein,\u201d as used herein, refers to a protein or polypeptide, such as a TCR or CAR, that specifically binds to a Bob1 peptide antigen (or to a Bob1 peptide antigen:HLA complex, e.g., on a cell surface), and does not bind a peptide sequence that does not include the Bob1 peptide antigen. Typically, for the purposes of this disclosure, the Bob1 peptide antigen comprises or consists of the sequence of SEQ ID NO:5 and the Bob1 peptide antigen:HLA complex comprises SEQ ID NO:5:HLA*B35:01).</p>In certain embodiments, a Bob1-specific binding protein specifically binds to a Bob1 peptide antigen (or a Bob1 peptide antigen:HLA complex) with a Kd of less than about 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, less than about 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>M, less than about 10<sup>\u221210 </sup>M, less than about 10<sup>\u221211 </sup>M, less than about 10<sup>\u221212 </sup>M, or less than about 10<sup>\u221213 </sup>M, or with an affinity that is about the same as, at least about the same as, or is greater than at or about the affinity exhibited by an exemplary Bob1-specific binding protein provided herein, such as any of the Bob1-specific TCRs provided herein, for example, as measured by the same assay. In certain embodiments, a Bob1-specific binding protein comprises a Bob1-specific immunoglobulin superfamily binding protein or binding portion thereof. Typically, for the purposes of this disclosure, the Bob1 peptide antigen comprises or consists of the sequence of SEQ ID NO:5 and the Bob1 peptide antigen:HLA complex comprises SEQ ID NO:5:HLA*B35:01).</p>The selective binding may be in the context of Bob1 antigen presentation by H LA-B*35:01. In other words, in certain embodiments, a binding protein that \u201cspecifically binds to a Bob1 antigen\u201d may only do so when it is being presented (i.e. it is bound by) HLA-B*35:01 or is in an equivalent structural formation as when it is being presented by HLA-B*35:01.</p>By \u201cspecifically bind(s) to\u201d as it relates to a T cell receptor, or as it refers to a recombinant T cell receptor, nucleic acid fragment, variant, or analog, or a modified cell, such as, for example, the Bob1 T cell receptors, and Bob1-expressing modified cells herei"
