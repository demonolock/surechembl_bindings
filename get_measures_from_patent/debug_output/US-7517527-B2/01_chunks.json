    "4]. This divalent form of the single chain antibody should increase its binding affinity. While scUCHT1 produced from SP2/0 cells was mainly in the divalent form, a small fraction of the antibody had a higher molecular weight, nearly comparable to that of the human IgM pentamer, the natural form of secreted human IgM.</p>Western Blotting Analysis of scUCHT1.</p>scUCHT1 was precipitated from the culture supernatant using goat anti-human IgM-Agarose (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo., USA), and separated on 4-20% SDS-PAGE gradient gel under reducing and non-reducing conditions. The separated proteins were transferred to ProBlott\u2122 membrane (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif., USA) by electroblotting at 50 volts for 1 hour. The membrane was blocked and incubated with alkaline phosphatase labeled goat anti-human IgM antibody (PIERCE, Rockford, Ill., USA) following the manufacturer's instruction. Color development was carried out with substrate NBT/BCIP(PIERCE).</p>Purification of scUCHT1.</p>Culture supernatant was mixed with anti-human IgM-Agarose, and incubated at 4\u00b0 C. with shaking overnight, and then the mixture was transferred to a column. The column was washed with washing buffer (0.01 M Na-phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.5 M NaCl) until the OD280 of flow-through was &lt;0.01. scUCHT1 was eluted with elution buffer (0.1 M glycine, pH 2.4, and 0.15 M NaCl). The fractions were neutralized with 1 M Na-phosphate (pH 8.0) immediately, and then concentrated and dialyzed against PBS.</p>Competitive Binding Assay.</p>The parental antibody UCHT1 was iodinated using Bolton-Hunter Reagent (NEN, Wilmington, Del., USA) as described previously [34]. The <sup>125</sup>I-labeled UCHT1 was used as tracer and diluted with DMEM medium to 0.3-0.6 nM. UCHT1 and the purified scUCHT1 from COS-7 and SP2/0 transfectant cells were used as competitors. Human CD3 expressing Jurkat cells were suspended in DMEM medium (2\u00d710<sup>7</sup>/ml) 50 \u03bcl of such cell suspension (1\u00d710<sup>6</sup>) was incubated with 50 \u03bcl diluted tracerand 50 ml diluted competitors on ice for 2 hours. Afterwards, cells were pelleted, and counted in a gamma counter. Results were expressed as a percentage of the <sup>125</sup>I-UCHT1 bound to cells in the absence of competitors (FIG. 6).</p>scUCHT1 from both COS-7 and SP2/0 cells could specifically inhibit the binding of <sup>125</sup>I-UCHT1 to Jurkat cells in a dose dependent way. As the concentration of the competitors (UCHT1, scUCHT1 from COS-7 and SP2/0 cells) increased from 1 to 100 nM, the tracer (125I iodinated UCHT1) bound to Jurkat cells decreased from 80% to nearly 0%. No significant difference was observed among the affinity curves of UCHT1 and scUCHT1 from COS-7 and SP2/0 cells. This indicates that the engineered antibody scUCHT1 has nearly the same affinity as UCHT1. Moreover, scUCHT1 contains human IgM constant region, and is expected be less immunogenic than UCHT1. The degree of its immunogenicity might vary due to the murine variable region of scUCHT1. H"
