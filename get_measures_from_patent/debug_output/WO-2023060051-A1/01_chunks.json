    "21-YTE injection and red upward arrows indicate day of birth. Mother #2 received two injections to maintain high levels of the infused antibody. [0025] FIG. 2C shows the pharmacokinetics of Nb WT PGTG121 in mother #3 and her baby #3.1. Mother #3 was infused with 5mg/kg of plant WT PGTG121. The black down arrow shows the time of WT PGTG121 injection and the red upward arrow indicates day of birth. [0026] FIG. 2D shows the pharmacokinetics of Nb WT PGTG121 in mother #4 and her baby #4.1. Mother #4 was infused with 5mg/kg of plant WT PGTG121. Black down arrows show times of WT PGTG121 injection and the red upward arrow indicates \n\nday of birth. Mother #4 received two injections to maintain high levels of the infused antibody. [0027] FIG. 3 shows placental transfer of mAbs to babies from a macaque injected with three different antibodies, Nb VRC07-523-LS, and mammalian PGT121 and 830A. Mother #6 was injected with 5mg/kg of each of the three different mAbs 6 days prior to birth. Mother #6 and baby #6.1 were assayed for the presence of Nb VRC07-523-LS, and mammalian PGT121 and 830A. The levels in the babies are depicted in darker shades than the corresponding mAbs levels in the mother. Only the mammalian PGT121 nd 830A mAbs crossed the placenta. [0028] FIG. 4 compares plant and mammalian PGT121 binding to macaque FcRgRIIa, FcRgIIb and FcgRIII using biolayer interferometry (BLI), receptor on solid phase. [0029] FIG. 5A compares SPR response curves and equilibrium binding constants (KD) of plant- and mammalian-derived PGT121 to human and macaque FcRn. mAbs were directly printed onto the SPR chip and analyzed for binding to human (A) over the range of 1,000-15.6 nM. Wild type antibodies included plant-derived PGT121 and VRC07-523, and mammalian (293F)-derived PGT121 and 830A and Herceptin. [0030] FIG. 5B compares SPR response curves and equilibrium binding constants (KD) of plant and mammalian PGT121 to human and macaque FcRn. mAbs were directly printed onto the SPR chip and analyzed for binding to rhesus macaque (B) over the range of 1,000-15.6 nM. . Wild type antibodies included plant-derived PGT121 and VRC07-523, and mammalian-derived PGT121 (CHO) and 830A (HEK293) and Herceptin. [0031] FIG. 5C shows the comparison of the equilibrium binding constants (KD) measured by SPR of plant-derived PGT121 and the PGT121 YTE and PGT121 LS Fc mutants to macaque FcRn confirming the higher binding of the engineered YTE and LS mutants. Wild type antibodies included plant-derived PGT121 and VRC07-523, and mammalian -derived PGT121 (CHO) and 830A (HEK293) and Herceptin. As shown in FIG. 5A-C plant PGT121 bound to both human and macaque FcRn, with better binding to the macaque FcRn than the mammalian PGT121. [0032] FIG. 6 shows the comparison of ability of plant and mammalian PGT121 to induce FcR effector function as measured using an antibody-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP) assay. (Chan et al. J Immunol. 197(7):2936-47 (2016)). Plant PGT121 was less \n\nefficient in this functional phagocytosis assay than mammalian PGT121 reflecting reduced binding to FcRs. [0033] FIG. 7 shows antibody binding to Fc\u03b3RI (CD64), which was measured using an IL-2 ELISA. The antibodies tested were plant produced Nb PGT121-LS, Nb PGT121-YTE, Nb PGT121, Nb PGT121-KDEL and Nb VRC01-KDEL, and mammalian PGT121, VRC07-523, VRC07-523-LS, 830A, with a LS HIG positive control. Both plant and mammalian antibodies bound Fc\u03b3RI. The results confirm that plant mAbs bind and trigger IL-2 production in BW cells transfected with Fc\u03b3RI, although at a slower rates than the mammalian counterparts. [0034] FIG. 8 shows antibody binding to Fc\u03b3RIIA (CD32A), which was measured using an IL-2 ELISA. The antibodies tested were the same as those in FIG. 7. The results show that mammalian and con",

Association and dissociation curves were plotted. [00122] Phagocytosis Assay: According to Chan et al. (J Immunol. 197(7):2936-47, 2016) fluorescent polystyrene beads (Life technologies #F8823) were conjugated with Bal gp120 protein via crosslinking carboxylic bead surface with primary amines on Bal gp120. Assay plates were prepared with antibodies titrations at 5x dilutions from 25,000ng/ml to 0.32ng/ml, in THP-1 media (RPMI + 10% FBS). Bal gp120 coupled beads and THP-1 cells were added to the assay plate at a 10:1 bead to cells ratio for a total of 20,000 cells. The assay plate was incubated at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2 for 4 hours. Cells were washed in cold PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed, and analysed on a flow cytometer. [00123] Flow cytometry analysis included gating on cell populations in the FSC vs SSC plot, followed by exporting the FITC+ signal\u2019s median fluorescent intensities (MFI). A phagocytosis score was calculated by multiplying the MFI value with the percent FITC positive and plotted. Results <sup>[00124] FIG. 4 shows a c</sup>omparison of plant and mammalian PGT121 binding to macaque FcRgRIIa, FcRgIIb and FcgRIII using biolayer interferometry (BLI), receptor <sub>on solid</sub> phase as described by Chan et al , 2016. [00125] FIG. 5 shows a comparison of SPR response curves and equilibrium binding constants (KD) of plant and mammalian PGT121 to human and macaque FcRn. \n\nmAbs were directly printed onto the SPR chip and analyzed for binding to human (A) and rhesus macaque (B) over the range of 1,000-15.6 nM. (C) Comparison of the equilibrium binding constants (KD) measured by SPR of plant-derived PGT121 YTE and LS Fc mutants to macaque FcRn confirming the higher binding of the engineered YTE and LS mutants. Wild type antibodies included plant-derived PGT121 and VRC07-523- LS, and mammalian (CHO)-derived PGT121 and HEK293-derived 830A and Herceptin. Plant PGT121 bound to both human and macaque FcRn, with better binding to the macaque FcRn than the mammalian PGT121. [00126] FIG. 6 shows a comparison of the ability of plant and mammalian PGT121 to induce FcR effector function as measured using an antibody-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP) assay. (Chan et al, 2016). Plant PGt121 was less efficient in this functional phagocytosis assay than Man PGT121 reflecting reduced binding to FcRs. [00127] The data show that plant antibodies bind human and macaque FcRn. FcRN is responsible for retention of antibodies in foetal circulation. YTE and LS mutant antibodies were made to increase binding to FcRN and to help the antibodies cross the placenta into foetal circulation. These mutations did increase affinity for FcRN. The results demonstrated that despite binding to FcRN, the plant antibodies did not cross the placenta to enter foetal circulation. Example 3. Fc\u03b3R Engagement mAb Panel [00128] Antibody binding to human Fc receptors was measured using an IL-2 ELISA. This assay differs from the above binding assay (BLI assay) of Example 2, because this assay involves cell triggering and IL-2 production. ie cell activation. The assay uses Fc receptor with CD3 signalling sequence \u2013 therefore indicating whether the Fc is triggered. The antibodies tested were plant produced Nb PGT121-LS, Nb PGT121- YTE, Nb PGT121, Nb PGT121-KDEL and Nb VRC01-KDEL, and mammalian PGT121, VRC07-523, VRC07-523-LS, 830A, with a LS HIG positive control. [00129] IL-2 production assays: As an alternative method for assessing FcR binding, we utilized a method previously described by Corrales-Aguilar, et al. utilizing a panel of BW5147 (mouse T cell lymphoma) cells which have been stably transfected to express a chimeric receptor containing a rhesus macaque Fc\u03b3R (FcRI, FcRIIA, FcRIIB, or FcRIII) ectodomain and the CD3\u03b6 intracellular signaling domain (received from Hartmut Hengel, Philipp Kolb, and team). This chimeric FcR leads to IL-2 secretion upon engagement with IgG with the corresponding Fc characteristics. Parental BW5147 \n\ncells without FcR-CD3\u03b6 expression were used as a negative control to assess background IL-2 secretion. [00130] In brief, high-binding 96-well plates (vendor info) were coated with a 3- fold serial dilution starting at 50 \u03bcg/mL of each monoclonal antibody of interest in 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate buffer overnight at 4\u00b0C. Then, 50,000 BW5147 FcR-CD3\u03b6 cells were added and cultured in RPMI (vendor) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS (vendor), sodium pyruvate (vendor), and \u03b2-mercaptoeth",
    "onfirm that plant mAbs bind and trigger IL-2 production in BW cells transfected with Fc\u03b3RI, although at a slower rates than the mammalian counterparts. FIG. 8 and Table 11 show binding to Fc\u03b3RIIA (CD32A) and the results show that mammalian and control antibodies but not plant antibodies bound Fc\u03b3RIIA and trigger IL-2 production in BW cells transfected with Fc\u03b3RIIA. FIG. 9 and Table 12 show binding to Fc\u03b3RIIB (CD32B) and the results show that only mammalian antibodies bound Fc\u03b3RIIB. [00132] FIG. 10 and Table 13 show binding to Fc\u03b3RIII (CD16) and the results show that all WT plant produced antibodies did not bind Fc\u03b3RIIIA (CD16), whilst the mammalian antibodies, positive control and Nb PGT121-KDEL did bind. Addition of \n\nthe ER-retrieval KDEL tag, resulted in a Nb PGT121-KDEL mAb lacking the complex glycans fucose or xylose and recovery of significant binding to Fc\u03b3RIIIA and IL-2 production. [00133] FIG.11 shows the no Fc\u03b3R negative control and no antibodies bound. The results show that all antibodies bound Fc\u03b3RI (CD64). All plant produced antibodies did not bind Fc\u03b3RIIA (CD32A) and Fc\u03b3RIIB (CD32B), whilst the mammalian antibodies and positive control did bind. All plant produced antibodies except Nb PGT121-KDEL did not bind Fc\u03b3RIII (CD16), whilst the mammalian antibodies, positive control and Nb PGT121-KDEL did bind. Accordingly, despite the mutations to enhance plasma transfer, the plant antibodies still did not bind Fc\u03b3RIIA (CD32A) and Fc\u03b3RIIB (CD32B).

Glycosylation occurs on asparagine residues. Note that the asparagine numbering on each antibody are all equivalent to asparagine 297, the numbers are higher because the HIV antibodies have many amino acids comprising CDR3. [00135] Methods: 25 \u00b5g of each sample (1 mg/mL; 50 \u00b5L/vial) was used for glycoproteomic analysis. The samples were reduced via DTT and alkylated via iodoacetamide before the proteins were enzymatically digested with trypsin at 37\u00b0C overnight. After inactivation of the trypsin, the solutions were filtered. The peptides and glycopeptides were analyzed via nano-liquid chromatography nanospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (nLC-NSI-MS/MS): The samples were injected to an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer through a nano-LC system and the glycopeptides were fragmented by HCD triggered CID program (based on glycoform oxonium ions). The data sets were processed by Byonic software and further analyzed by manual annotation. [00136] For calculation of the relative percentages, th",
    " mutation removes a methionine in each LS sample. [00162] For the PGT121 sample (Table 15): The sequence carried 4 methionine residues on 4 peptides within the sequence of the heavy chain. 4 out of 4 methionine residues were covered by the method and analyzed. They were found to be almost fully present as methionine (98.66% - 100%). [00163] For the 830A sample (Table 15): The sequence carried 1 methionine residue within the sequence of the heavy chain, which was covered by MS analysis. It was found to be almost fully present as methionine (98.72%). [00164] For the VRC07-523 sample (Table 15): The sequence carried 7 methionine residues on 6 peptides within the sequence of the heavy chain. 5 out of 7 methionine residues were covered by the method and analyzed. They were found to be almost fully present as methionine (96.89% - 99.52%). [00165] For the VRC07-523-LS sample (Table 15): The sequence carried 7 methionine residues on 6 peptides within the sequence of the heavy chain. 4 out of 7 methionine residues were covered by the method and analyzed. They were found to be almost fully present as methionine (95.96% - 97.55%). [00166] In proteins, oxidation of methionine residues to methionine sulfoxide can serve as an indicator to protein dysfunctionality and degradation. All samples from report YR112119Z (sent 02/13/2020) were identified with base level amounts of methionine sulfoxide (\u2264 4.04%). \u201cBase levels of oxidation are typically found at 0% to 5% in most proteins\u201d (from Sen KI, Hepler R, Nanda H. Detection and Measurement of Methionine Oxidation in Proteins. Curr Protoc Protein Sci. 2017 Feb 2;87:14.16.1- 14.16.11. doi: 10.1002/cpps.25). [00167] The PTM assignment of methionine and methionine sulfoxide residues was based on the molecular weight of the peptides of interest and the analysis via nLC- MS/MS-derived data. [00168] The results show that the plant antibodies were not oxidised. This indicates that an oxidised state was not responsible for the plant antibodies not crossing the placenta in Example 1, and that an oxidised state was not responsible for the plant antibodies failing to bind particular Fc receptors in Examples 2 and 3. As such, the data \n\nsuggest that particular glycans are responsible for the plant antibodies not crossing the placenta and that one or more Fc receptors other than FcRN are responsible for antibodies crossing the placenta.
