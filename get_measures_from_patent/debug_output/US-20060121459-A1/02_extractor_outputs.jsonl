{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that meet the specified criteria. The text does not contain any specific molecule names, bioactivity metrics (IC50, Ki, Kd, EC50), numeric values, or units that are required for a sentence to be considered relevant."}
{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nThe K<sub>a </sub>determined for a preparation of polyclonal antibodies, which are heterogeneous in their affinities for multiple REMAP epitopes, represents the average affinity, or avidity, of the antibodies for REMAP, with K<sub>a </sub>ranging from about 10<sup>9 </sup>to 10<sup>12 </sup>L/mole. \nHigh-affinity antibody preparations with K<sub>a </sub>ranging from about 10<sup>9 </sup>to 10<sup>12 </sup>L/mole are preferred for use in immunoassays in which the REMAP-antibody complex must withstand rigorous manipulations. \nLow-affinity antibody preparations with K<sub>a </sub>ranging from about 10<sup>6 </sup>to 10<sup>7 </sup>L/mole are preferred for use in immunopurification and similar procedures which ultimately require dissociation of REMAP, preferably in active form, from the antibody."}

Please let me know how I can assist you further."}
