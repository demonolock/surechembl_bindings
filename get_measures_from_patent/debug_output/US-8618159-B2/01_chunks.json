The compounds of this invention have been demonstrated to displace [<sup>3</sup>H]-Methylhistamine radioligand binding to mammalian cell membranes expressing rhesus (Macacca Mulatta) H3 receptor. These compounds display rhesus H3 affinity constants (Ki) in the range of 1 \u03bcM to &lt;1 nM. Additionally, the compounds of this invention have been demonstrated by GTP\u03b3S radioligand binding assay to inhibit rhesus H3 constitutive functional activity in cell membranes. This inhibition of basal rhesus H3-mediated GTP\u03b3S radioligand binding demonstrates that the compounds of this invention find utility as inverse agonists. These compounds decreased rhesus H3 GTP\u03b3S radioligand binding by 0-40% below basal levels.</p>Rhesus H3 membranes were prepared from the Flp-In T-REx 293 Cell Line (Invitrogen) stably transfected with pcDNA5/FRT/TO (Invitrogen) containing the rhesus monkey (Macacca Mulatta) 445 amino acid H3 receptor. (Genbank #AY231164). Stably transfected cultures were amplified in tissue culture flasks by standard tissue culture methods and induced to express rhesus H3 by exposure to 500 ng/ml tetracycline (Cellgro) for 24 hours. After induction, cells were dissociated from flasks utilizing Cell Stripper (Cellgro). Cells were centrifuged (1K\u00d7g, 5 min) and pellet frozen in an ethanol-dry ice bath to disrupt cell membranes. Frozen cell pellet was re-suspended in 5 mM HEPES (pH 7.4, Invitrogen) at 10 ml/1000 cm2 of harvested cells. The cell suspension was drawn through an 18 gauge needle (2-3\u00d7) followed by a 23 gauge needle (2-3\u00d7) to further disrupt cell membranes. The cell suspension was centrifuged (40K\u00d7g, 30 min). Cell membrane pellet was re-suspended in 5 mM HEPES (pH 7.4, Invitrogen) at a final protein concentration of 10 mg/ml. Rhesus H3 membranes were stored under liquid nitrogen prior to use in [3H]-Methylhistamine and GTP\u03b3S radioligand binding assays.</p>Rhesus H3 radioligand binding assay was performed using rhesus H3 receptor membranes (prepared as described above), [3H]-Methylhistamine (Perkin Elmer) and WGA SPA beads (wheat germ agglutinin scintillation proximity assay) beads (Amersham). The assay was performed in 96-well Opti-Plates (Packard). Each reaction contained 50 \u03bcl rhesus H3 membranes (20-30 \u03bcg total protein), 50 \u03bcl WGA SPA beads (0.1 \u03bcg) and 50 \u03bcl of 83 Ci/mmol [<sup>3</sup>H]-Methylhistamine (final concentration 2 nM) and 50 \u03bcl of tested compound. The compounds of this invention and/or vehicle were diluted with binding buffer from 10 mM DMSO stocks. Assay plates were sealed with TopSeal (Perkin Elmer) and mixed on shaker (25\u00b0 C., 1 hour). Assay plates were read on TopCount scintillation counter (Packard). Results were analyzed by Hill transformation and Ki values were determined by Cheng-Prusoff equation. The observed binding data for a few of the representative compounds of this invention are summarized in Table 1.</p>TABLE 1Affinity: ki inInverse Agonism: %Rhesus H3inhibition of Basal GTP\u03b3SExample No.membrane (nM)binding in Rhesus H372.06\u221231520.77\u221217730.78\u221215861.42\u221218</p>Example 149This Example illustrates that the stereochemistry of the compounds of this invention has an effect on the biological activity. A few of the representative compounds of this invention were used in this example to show this difference in biological activity based on the stereoisomeric form. All of the compounds of this Example were tested for H3 receptor ligand activity in accordance with the procedures as set forth in Example 148. The results are tabulated in Table 2.</p>TABLE 2Affinity: ki in Rhesus H3Example No.membrane (nM)37.35120.8112.512147.2</p>Example 150This Example illustrates selective affinity of the compounds of this invention at H3 receptors and exhibit low activity at the MCH-1 receptor site.</p>The H3 affinity of the compounds of this invention was measured in accordance with the procedures set forth in Example 148.</p>The activity of the compounds of this invention at the MCH-1 receptor site, if any, was measured by the procedures as set forth below.\nTest Compounds: The compounds of this invention were stored in a 96-well microtiter plates (1 nL, 10 mM, 100% DMSO). Each of the test sample was diluted with 249 \u03bcL of 100% DMSO (dilution 1:250). The test compounds were further diluted 1:4 (0.1% DMSO) during assay resulting in the final concentration of test compounds of this invention to be 10 nM.Negative Control: 40 \u03bcM of MCH-1 in assay buffer with 0.4% DMSO were transferred to the dilution microtiter plates for control which resulted in final concentration of 10 nM.Blank: Assay buffer containing 0.4% DMSO were transferred to the dilution microtiter plates for blanksAssay Procedure: The filter plates with 250 mL of 0.5% PEI-solution/well were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. PEI was removed by vacuum filtration just before pipetting (Univac Polyfiltronic/Whatman). The solution of the compound as prepared above (50 \u03bcL), or MCH-1 (negative control) or Puffer/DMSO (positive control) were added to 96-well round bottom microtiter plate. Then 50 \u03bcl of [<sup>125</sup>J]-ligand solution was added followed by 100 \u03bcl of membrane suspension. The plates were closed with the lids, and incubated for 60 min. at 25\u00b0 C. The samples were transferred to GF/B filter plate. The reaction mixture was removed by vacuum filtration, washed 4\u00d7 with 300 \u03bcl ice-cold washing buffer and the washing solution was removed by vacuum filtration. The rubber layer at the bottom of the plate was then removed and the filters were dried over night at room temperature. 25 \u03bcl of scintillation cocktail was added and the plates were sealed and, plate frames were added and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The radioactivity was then measured, settings <sup>125</sup>J standard, 30 sec./well. From this the percent inhibition of ligand binding was measured.Results: In general the compounds of this invention exhibited a rhesus H3 binding ki value in the range of from about 400 nM to less than 1 nM, whereas the percent inhibition of ligand binding at MCH-1 receptor was less than 40% at 10 \u03bcM concentration. This comparative Example demonstrates that the compounds of this invention can be more than thousand times more selective at H3 receptor site than at MCH-1 receptor site.\n</p>Example 151This Example illustrates the study of efficacy of the compounds of this invention in enhancing the wakefulness in animal models.</p>Male Sprague Dawley rats (Charles River, France) weighing 250\u00b110 g were anaesthetized with Zoletil\u00ae 50 (60 mg/kg ip) and mounted in a stereotaxic apparatus. Cortical electrodes (small stainless steel screw electrodes of 0.9 mm in diameter) were screwed into the bone over the sensorimotor cortex (1.5 mm lateral to the median suture and 1.5 mm behind the fronto-parietal suture), the visual cortex (1.5 mm lateral to the median suture and 1.5 mm in front of the parieto-occipital suture) and over the cerebellum (reference electrode). Cortical electrodes were attached to a connector (Winchester, 7-lead) and fixed with dental cement to the cranium.</p>After three weeks of post-operative recovery, animals were placed in plexiglass cylinders (60 cm diameter) with free access to food and water. The temperature of the room was kept constant (21\u00b11\u00b0 C.) and lights were on from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. The rats were recorded from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. during three consecutive days: control day (D1), drug day (D2) and post"
