    " nucleus as a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex composed of the three influenza virus polymerase proteins, the nucleoprotein (NP), and the viral RNA, in association with the influenza virus matrix 1 (Ml) protein and nuclear export protein (Marsh et al, J Virol, 82:2295-2304, 2008). The Ml protein that lies within the envelope is thought to function in assembly and budding. A limited number of M2 proteins are integrated into the virions (Zebedee, J. Virol. 62:2762-2772, 1988). They form tetramers having H+ ion channel activity, and when activated by the low pH in endosomes, acidify the inside of the virion, facilitating its uncoating (Pinto et ah, Cell 69:517-528, 1992). Amantadine is an anti-influenza drug that prevents viral \n\n infection by interfering with M2 ion channel activity, thus inhibiting virus uncoating. </p> NS1, a nonstructural protein, has multiple functions, including regulation of splicing and nuclear export of cellular mRNAs as well as stimulation of translation. The major function of NS1 seems to be to counteract the interferon activity of the host, since an NS1 knockout virus was viable although it grew less efficiently than the parent virus in interferon-nondefective cells (Garcia-Sastre, Virology 252:324- 330, 1998). </p> NS2 has been detected in virus particles (Richardson et ah, Arch. Virol. 116:69-80, 1991; Yasuda et al, Virology 196:249-255, 1993). The average number of NS2 proteins in a virus particle was estimated to be 130-200 molecules. An in vitro binding assay shows direct protein-protein contact between Ml and NS2. NS2-M1 complexes have also been detected by immunoprecipitation in virus- infected cell lysates. The NS2 protein is thought to play a role in the export of RNP from the nucleus through interaction with Ml protein (Ward et al., Arch. Virol. 140:2067-2073, 1995). </p>V. Influenza Proteins, VLPs and Administration Thereof </p> Optimized influenza HA polypeptides and influenza VLPs comprising an optimized HA (such as the HA having the sequence set forth as SEQ ID NO: 2) are provided herein. The optimized HA polypeptides can be administered to elicit an immune response against influenza. In particular examples, the optimized HA polypeptides are administered as part of a VLP. </p> The influenza VLPs are made up of the HA, NA and Ml proteins. The production of influenza VLPs has been described in the art and is within the abilities of one of ordinary skill in the art. As described herein, influenza VLPs can be produced by transfection of host cells with plasmids encoding the HA, NA and Ml proteins. After incubation of the transfected cells for an appropriate time to allow for protein expression (such as for approximately 72 hours), VLPs can be isolated from cell culture supernatants. Example 1 below provides an exemplary protocol for purifying influenza VLPs from cell supernatants. In this example, VLPs are \n\n isolated by low speed centrifugation (to remove cell debris), vacuum filtration and ultracentrifugation "
