Assay tubes were prepared in duplicate containing incubation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM KCl and 120 mM NaCl) and <sup>3</sup>[H] paroxetine at 6 different concentrations (0 to 2 nM) with and without 150 mM fluoxetine. The actual concentration of paroxetine in each tube was determined using a 40 ml aliquot taken from each tube prior to the addition of platelet membranes. The experiment was started by the addition of 80 mg of platelet membrane protein then the assay tubes were incubated for 1 hr at 23\u00b0C. The reaction was quenched by addition of ice-cold wash buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA) and rapid fiitering through Whatman GF/B filters treated with 0.3% polyethylenimine using a Brandel Cell Harvester. Filters were washed 3 times with ice-cold wash buffer, dried over-night, placed in scintillation vials containing 5 ml of Beckman Ready Protein+ scintillation counting fluid and counted in a Beckman LS-6500 liquid scintillation counter. Disintegrations per minute (DPM) from the 40 ml aliquots were converted into nM of paroxetine to obtain the actual concentrations in each tube. Total and non-specific binding of paroxetine was plotted against each actual concentration. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting non-specific binding from total binding. Kd and Bmax of paroxetine binding were calculated using Prism4 software (Graphpad). Paroxetine binding (Bmax) was expressed as fmol/mg of platelet membrane protein and Kd as nM. Protein concentrations were measured using the BioRad method and a SPECTRAmax PLUS384 Micro-plate spectrophotometer.</p>Genotyping- The blood sample for the determination of SERT genotype was drawn at enrollment. White blood cells were separated from plasma and re-suspended, and DNA was isolated using PUREGENE, Gentra systems according to the manufacturer's protocol. The 5'-HTTLPR 44 bp promoter region repeat polymorphism was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from ~ 50 ng of DNA using two primers: 5'-CGT TGC CGC TCT GAA TGC CAG-3' AND 5'-GGA TTC TGG TGC CAC CTA GAC GCC-3' and in a 25-ul final volume consisting of 0.5 U of Tfl DNA polymerase (Epicentre), 1X PCR buffer, 1.5 ml MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 200 uM dNTPs, 1X enhancer, and 0.6 uM of each primer. The PCR conditions were as follows: 94\u00b0 for 30 s; 70\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s); a final extension of 72\u00b0C for 7 min and terminal hold at 4\u00b0C. Separation by gel electrophoresis using 4% MetaPhor agarose (Cambrex, Rockland, ME) allowed visualization by ethidium bromide/UV detection of the two variants (long (L) and short (S): fragment sizes = 464 bp and 420 bp, respectively) of the promoter region of the SCL4A gene (-1415 to -951) [16].</p>Statistical Analyses- Means and standard deviations for outcome variables of platelet variables (Km and Vmax of 5HT uptake into intact platelets, and Kd and Bmax of paroxetine binding on platelet plasma membranes) were examined. Non-normal distributions of outcome variables were transformed. Planned analyses included Pearson correlations to examine the relationships the platelet variables. T-tests were used to determine whether there were group differences in the LL genotypes vs. S-carrier genotypes, in psychiatric disorders, current, and lifetime drinking, for the dependent variables for platelet 5HT function (Bmax Kd. Vmax, and KM).</p>Results - The distribution of genotypes was the following: LL, n = 8, LS, n = 9, SS, n = 4. Since S-carriers (LS and SS) were the predominant genotypes in the sample. LS and SS were pooled for the analyses of group differences (e.g., LL vs. S-carriers).</p>There were no statistically significant differences in age or ethnicity between the LL and S-carriers (see Table 1). However, the LL group had a significantly earlier age of onset and longer duration of alcohol use, but did not have significant differences in quantitative measures of recent drinking. The LL group also had significantly higher inattention and motor components of trait impulsivity, and a trend towards significant differences in total BIS-11 trait impulsivity. All participants had a current Alcohol Use Disorder based on DSM-IV criteria. There were no significant differences between genotype groups in other the DSM-IV psychiatric groups.</p>Table 2 and Figure 4 present the results of the platelet studies. Participants having the LL genotype had significantly higher Bmax and Kd than did S-carriers, indicating greater amounts of SERT with lower affinity for paroxetine binding. There were no genotype group differences in the platelet functional measures of 5HT uptake.</p>Discussion - The main finding was that SERT genotype predicted differences in age of onset and duration of drinking, as well as the platelet binding profile of SERT among adolescent subjects with an alcohol use disorder. Specifically, adolescents with the LL genotype began drinking at a younger age and showed greater 3H-paroxetine binding at lower affinity than did S-carriers.</p>Even though both groups of participants had an onset of alcohol use disorder during adolescence and were of the same current age (i.e., mean=18.7 yrs), participants with an LL-genotype had significantly earlier age of onset of drinking (i.e., 13.5 vs. 15.2 years of age) compared to the S-carriers. This finding is consistent with a hypothesis described by Johnson [22] predicting that the LL genotype would be associated with an earlier age of onset of problem drinking. Also consistent with the Johnson hypothesis, the LL-group also had higher levels of behavioral vulnerability (i.e., trait impulsivity) than did the S-carriers [1, 15, 22]. This latter finding is interesting in light of the literature suggesting LL-genotypes may have lower 5-HT in the synaptic cleft and lower central turnover of 5-HT associated with higher levels of impulsivity [1, 15, 22]. Interestingly, there were no significant group differe"
