{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n* Paroxetine binding (Bmax) was expressed as fmol/mg of platelet membrane protein and Kd as nM.\n* Participants having the LL genotype had significantly higher Bmax and Kd than did S-carriers, indicating greater amounts of SERT with lower affinity for paroxetine binding.\n* The actual concentration of paroxetine in each tube was determined using a 40 ml aliquot taken from each tube prior to the addition of platelet membranes, with concentrations ranging from 0 to 2 nM.\n* Kd and Bmax of paroxetine binding were calculated using Prism4 software (Graphpad), with Kd expressed as nM.\n* The LL group had a significantly earlier age of onset and longer duration of alcohol use, and also had significantly higher inattention and motor components of trait impulsivity, with paroxetine binding Kd values indicating lower affinity for paroxetine binding."}
