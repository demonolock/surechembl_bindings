    "ses less than about 0.6% low-molecular-weight (LMW) species after storage at 37 \u00b0C for one week. [0031] In one aspect, provided herein is an aqueous, non-lyophilized formulation, comprising: (i) an L-asparaginase, wherein the L-asparaginase comprises four monomer units, wherein each monomer unit has an amino acid sequence that is at least about 95% identical to SEQ ID NO: 1; (ii) one or more disaccharides, wherein the one or more disaccharides comprise trehalose, sucrose, or any combination thereof; and (iii) one or more buffers, wherein the one or more buffers are substantially free of amino acid, wherein the formulation comprises less than about 5% low-molecular-weight (LMW) species after storage at 37 \u00b0C for one week. \n\n [0032] In one aspect, a L-asparaginase in accordance with the disclosure provided herein is an recombinant L-asparaginase. In a further aspect, a L-asparaginase in accordance with the invention described herein is an enzyme with L-asparagine aminohydrolase activity. Such a L-asparaginase\u2019s enzymatic activity may include not only deamidation of asparagine to aspartic acid and ammonia, but also deamidation of glutamine to glutamic acid and ammonia. [0033] In some embodiments, a L-asparaginase as disclosed herein is active as a multimer. In some embodiments, the L-asparaginase is an active enzyme as a tetramer. A tetramer is composed of four subunits (also known as monomers). In some embodiments, a L-asparaginase is a tetramer consisting of four identical 35 kD subunits. In some embodiments, the L-asparaginase is a non-disulfide bonded tetrameric therapeutic protein. In a particular embodiment, each of the subunits or monomers of a multimeric L-asparaginase comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1. [0034] In a particular embodiment, each of the subunits or monomers of a tetrameric Lasparaginase comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1. In another embodiment, the L-asparaginase is from Erwinia chrysanthemi NCPPB 1066 (Genbank Accession No. CAA32884, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety), either with or without signal peptides and/or leader sequences. [0035] In some embodiments, the L-asparaginase is composed of multiple subunits, for example, four subunits or monomers (tetramer). A corresponding modified protein may then, e.g., consist of 1 to 20 (or more) peptides conjugated to each of the monomers of that tetramer. In some embodiments, the L-asparaginase comprises a monomer and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20 (or more) peptides conjugated to each of the L-asparaginase monomers. In a specific embodiment, the L- asparaginase is a multimer comprising multiple subunits or monomers, such as a tetramer, and each of the monomers in that tetramer is conjugated to 1 peptide, resulting in a tetramer comprising 4 conjugated peptides, one for each monomer. In some embodiments, the L- asparaginase is a tetramer comprising 1-4 peptides conjugated to each of the monomers. ",
    "ents, the dose of L-asparaginase formulation will be given to a human subject with hypersensitivity only when the hypersensitivity subsides. [0088] In an exemplary embodiment, a L-asparaginase formulation is administered to a human subject in an amount from about 10 mg/m<sup>2</sup> to 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. In an \n\nexemplary embodiment, a L-asparaginase formulation is administered intramuscularly every other day over a period of 5 consecutive days followed by a rest period of 2 consecutive days, wherein the amount is about 25 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. In an exemplary embodiment, a L-asparaginase formulation is administered intravenously every other day over a period of 5 consecutive days followed by a rest period of 2 consecutive days, wherein the amount is about 37.5 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. In an exemplary embodiment, a L-asparaginase formulation is administered intravenously every other day over a period of 5 consecutive days followed by a rest period of 2 consecutive days, wherein the amount is about 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. [0089] In further exemplary embodiments and in accordance with any of the discussion herein regarding dosing, the L-asparaginase formulation administered in such doses is not conjugated to a polymer such as a PEG moiety and/or is not conjugated to a peptide comprising solely alanine and/or proline residues. 1. Dose amount [0090] The amounts of the L-asparaginase formulation of the present disclosure that are to be delivered will depend on many factors, for example, the IC50, EC50, the biological half-life of the compound, the age, size, weight, and physical condition of the patient, and the disease or disorder to be treated. The importance of these and other factors to be considered are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Generally, the amount of the L-asparaginase formulation of the present disclosure will be administered at a range from about 1 milligram per square meter of the surface area of the patient's body (mg/m<sup>2</sup>) to 1,000/m<sup>2</sup>, with a dosage range of about 10 mg/m<sup>2</sup> to about 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> to treat disease, including but not limited to ALL or LBL. Of course, other dosages and/or treatment regimens may be employed, as determined by the attending physician. [0091] In some embodiments, the method comprises administering the recombinant L- asparaginase of the present disclosure at an amount from about 10 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and about 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. In some embodiments, the method comprises administering the L- asparaginase formulation of the present disclosure at an amount from 10 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. In some embodiments, the L-asparaginase formulation of the present disclosure is administered in an amount of about 10,15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 95, or 95 mg/m<sup>2</sup> or an equivalent amount thereof (for example on a protein content basis). In a more specific embodiment, the L-asparaginase formulation of the present disclosure is \n"
