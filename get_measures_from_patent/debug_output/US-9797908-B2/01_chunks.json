    "aining, e.g., oxidized glutathione and L-arginine. Refolding reagents can be flowed or otherwise moved into contact with the one or more polypeptide or other expression product, or vice-versa.</p>Antibodies</p>In one aspect, the invention provides antibodies to molecules of the invention, e.g., synthetases, tRNA, and proteins comprising unnatural amino acids. Antibodies to molecules of the invention are useful as purification reagents, e.g., for purifying the molecules of the invention. In addition, the antibodies can be used as indicator reagents to indicate the presence of a synthetase, a tRNA, or protein comprising an unnatural amino acid, e.g., to track the presence or location (e.g., in vivo or in situ) of the molecule.</p>An antibody of the invention can be a protein comprising one or more polypeptides substantially or partially encoded by immunoglobulin genes or fragments of immunoglobulin genes. The recognized immunoglobulin genes include the kappa, lambda, alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon and mu constant region genes, as well as myriad immunoglobulin variable region genes. Light chains are classified as either kappa or lambda. Heavy chains are classified as gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon, which in turn define the immunoglobulin classes, IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE, respectively. A typical immunoglobulin (e.g., antibody) structural unit comprises a tetramer. Each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one \u201clight\u201d (about 25 kD) and one \u201cheavy\u201d chain (about 50-70 kD). The N-terminus of each chain defines a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The terms variable light chain (VL) and variable heavy chain (V<sub>H</sub>) refer to these light and heavy chains, respectively.</p>Antibodies exist as intact immunoglobulins or as a number of well-characterized fragments produced by digestion with various peptidases. Thus, for example, pepsin digests an antibody below the disulfide linkages in the hinge region to produce F(ab\u2032)<sub>2</sub>, a dimer of Fab which itself is a light chain joined to V<sub>H</sub>-C<sub>H</sub>1 by a disulfide bond. The F(ab)<sub>2 </sub>may be reduced under mild conditions to break the disulfide linkage in the hinge region thereby converting the F(ab)<sub>2</sub>dimer into an Fab\u2032 monomer. The Fab\u2032 monomer is essentially an Fab with part of the hinge region (see, Fundamental Immunology, 4<sup>th </sup>addition, W.E. Paul, ed., Raven Press, N.Y. (1999), for a more detailed description of other antibody fragments). While various antibody fragments are defined in terms of the digestion of an intact antibody, one of skill will appreciate that such Fab\u2032 fragments, etc. may be synthesized de novo either chemically or by utilizing recombinant DNA methodology. Thus, the term antibody, as used herein, also optionally includes antibody fragments either produced by the modification of whole antibodies or synthesized de novo using recombinant DNA methodologies.
