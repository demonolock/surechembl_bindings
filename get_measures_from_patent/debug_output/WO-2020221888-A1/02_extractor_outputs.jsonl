{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\nDose response curves indicated a highly potent binding to 2PT-NBD1 and F508del-2PT-NBD1 (EC50 in the 1 nM to 50 nM range) for all nanobodies, except nanobody G3a, which displayed a weaker binding potency (Fig. la,e).\nIn each case the titrations were consistent with a 1:1 bimolecular association between nanobodies and monomeric 2PT-NBD1 with K\u038f values of 54 \u00b1 10, 25 \u00b1 10, 37.9 \u00b1 7, and 39 \u00b1 2 nM with nanobodies T2a, T27, T4, and T8 respectively.\nNanobody G3a bound 2PT-NBD1 with a lower affinity (1.1 mM \u00b1 0.1 pM) which is consistent with our determination of apparent affinity by ELISA (Fig. la,e)."}
