    "ptor is measured. Upon addition of a competitor test compound, the ISVD and NBD1 will separate and the FRET signal will decrease. Binding of the competitor test compound molecule on NBD1 will therefore be measured as decrease in FRET signal, indicating the test compound as a suitable candidate CFTR binding agent as disclosed herein, i.e. with the functional properties for acting as a CFTR thermal stabilizer to increase a melting temperature with at least 5\u00b0C as compared to a non-bound CFTR control.</p>The positive test compounds may be subjected to further confirmation of modulating or stabilizing CFTR, by co-crystallization of the compound with CFTR, or in particular with the NBD1 domain, and structural determination, as described herein. Additionally, the functional property can be tested by the thermal shift assay and DSF as described herein. Compounds designed or selected according to the methods disclosed herein are preferably assessed by a number of further in vitro and in vivo assays of CFTR interaction, in particular CFTR function to confirm their ability to affect CFTR protein maturation and its effect on functional ion channel transport activity. </p> For said screening assays, libraries may be screened in solution by the disclosed methods and/or methods generally known in the art for determining whether ligands competitively bind at a common binding site. Such methods may include screening libraries in solution, or on beads or chips. Where the screening assay is a binding assay, CFTR, in particular the NBD1 domain, may be joined to a label, as exemplified herein, where the label can directly or indirectly provide a detectable signal. Various labels include radioisotopes, fluorescent molecules, chemiluminescent molecules, enzymes, specific binding molecules, particles, e.g., magnetic particles, and the like. Specific binding molecules include pairs, such as biotin and streptavidin, digoxin and antidigoxin, etc. For the specific binding members, the complementary member would normally be labelled with a molecule that provides for detection, in accordance with known procedures. A variety of other reagents may be included in the screening assay. These include reagents like salts, neutral proteins, e.g., albumin, detergents, etc., which are used to facilitate optimal protein-protein binding and/or reduce non-specific or background interactions. Reagents that improve the efficiency of the assay, such as protease inhibitors, nuclease inhibitors, antimicrobial agents, etc., may be used. The components are added in any order that produces the requisite binding. Incubations are performed at any temperature that facilitates optimal activity, typically between 4\u00b0C and 40\u00b0C. Direct binding of compounds to CFTR, in particular its NBD1 domain, can also be done for example by Surface Plasmon Resonance (BIAcore). </p> Alternative CFTR binding agents for modulating CFTR activity </p> A final aspect of the invention provides for a binding agent specifica",
    "te. \n\nIt is to be understood that although particular embodiments, specific configurations as well as materials and/or molecules, have been discussed herein for methods, samples and biomarker products according to the disclosure, various changes or modifications in form and detail may be made without departing from the scope of this invention. The following examples are provided to better illustrate particular embodiments, and they should not be considered limiting the application. The application is limited only by the claims. </p>EXAMPLES </p> Example 1. Generation of high affinity Nanobodies against NBD1. </p> Two different llamas were immunized with 2PT-NBD1, a stabilized version of human CFTR NBD1 domain bearing the mutations S492P/A534P/I539T <sup>[19]</sup>. Nanobodies were obtained after phage display selection, using established protocols <sup>[16]</sup>. After two rounds of selection against 2PT-NBD1, a set of candidate binders was isolated. Among these nanobodies, we focused our biochemical characterization effort on 5 different nanobodies belonging to different sequence clusters, classified according to the sequences of the third complementarity determining region (CDR3) (Fig. 8). </p> Specific binding and apparent affinity of purified nanobodies D12, T2a, T27, T4, T8, and G 3a to 2PT-NBD1 were confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using immobilized 2PT-NBD1. Dose response curves indicated a highly potent binding to 2PT-NBD1 and F508del-2PT-NBD1 (EC50 in the 1 nM to 50 nM range) for all nanobodies, except nanobody G3a, which displayed a weaker binding potency (Fig. la,e). Interestingly, F508del mutation drastically affected binding of nanobodies T4, T8 and to a lesser extent G3a, while nanobodies D12, T2a and T27 were not affected by the deletion (Fig. lb-d).</p>Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to characterize the thermodynamic parameters of the binding (Fig. le and Fig. 9). In each case the titrations were consistent with a 1:1 bimolecular association between nanobodies and monomeric 2PT-NBD1 with K\u038f values of 54 \u00b1 10, 25 \u00b1 10, 37.9 \u00b1 7, and 39 \u00b1 2 nM with nanobodies T2a, T27, T4, and T8 respectively. Nanobody G3a bound 2PT-NBD1 with a lower affinity (1.1 mM \u00b1 0.1 pM) which is consistent with our determination of apparent affinity by ELISA (Fig. la,e). These K D values are similar to those measured for other in vivo matured camelid heavy-chain antibodies interacting with their ligands <sup>[20]</sup>. The thermodynamic parameters of the interaction of nanobodies with 2PT-NBD1 were determined based on these ITC measurements (Fig. le and Fig. 9).</p>Example 2. Thermal stabilization of NBD1 by nanobodies. </p> A range of mutations in NBD1 has already been described to improve thermal stability of this domain <sup>[5,9,2]</sup> more recently, Fie et al., showed that small molecules such as indole based-compounds, can counteract the folding defect of CFTR by stabilizing NBD1 <sup>[14]</sup>.
