    "n (for a classification, see \u201cClassification of Chronic Pain, Descriptions of Chronic Pain Syndromes and Definitions Of Pain Terms\u201d, 2nd edition, Meskey and Begduk, editors; IASP Press, Seattle, 1994), especially for the treatment of cancer-induced pain and chronic neuropathic pain like, for example, that associated with diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, peripheral nerve damage, central pain (for example as a consequence of cerebral ischemia) and trigeminal neuralgia, and other chronic pain such as, for example, lumbago, backache (low back pain) or rheumatic pain. In addition, these active ingredients are also suitable for the therapy of primary acute pain of any origin and of secondary states of pain resulting therefrom, and for the therapy of states of pain which were formerly acute and have become chronic.</p>The compounds of the invention can be employed alone or in combination with other active ingredients for the treatment of acute or chronic neurodegenerative disorders such as, for example, stroke, craniocerebral trauma, spinal cord injuries, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Niemann Pick disease.</p>The in vitro effect of the compounds of the invention can be shown in the following assays:</p>1. Determination of the Affinity of Test Substances for \u03b17 nAChR by Inhibition of [<sup>3</sup>H]-Methyllycaconitine Binding to Rat Brain Membranes</p>The [3H]-methyllycaconitine binding assay is a modification of the method described by Davies et al. (Neuropharmacol. 1999, 38, 679-690).</p>Rat brain tissue (hippocampus or whole brain) is homogenized in homogenization buffer (10% w/v) [0.32 M sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 0.01% (w/v) NaN<sub>3</sub>, pH 7.4, 4\u00b0 C.] at 600 rpm in a glass homogenizer. The homogenate is centrifuged (1000\u00d7g, 4\u00b0 C., 10 min) and the supernatant is removed. The pellet is resuspended (20% w/v) and the suspension is centrifuged (1000\u00d7g, 4\u00b0 C., 10 min). The two supernatants are combined and centrifuged (15 000\u00d7g, 4\u00b0 C., 30 min). The pellet obtained in this way is referred to as the P2 fraction.</p>The P2 pellet is washed twice with binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4), and centrifuged (15 000\u00d7g, 4\u00b0 C., 30 min).</p>The P2 membranes are resuspended in binding buffer and incubated in a volume of 250 \u03bcl (amount of membrane protein 0.1-0.5 mg) in the presence of 1-5 nM [<sup>3</sup>H]-methyllycaconitine, 0.1% (w/v) BSA (bovine serum albumin) and various concentrations of the test substance at 21\u00b0 C. for 2.5 h. The non-specific binding is determined by incubation in the presence of 1 \u03bcM \u03b1-bungarotoxin or 100 \u03bcM nicotine or 10 \u03bcM MLA (methyllycaconitine).</p>The incubation is stopped by adding 4 ml of PBS (20 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 5 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, 4\u00b0 C.) and filtering through type A/E glass fiber filters (Gelman Sciences) which have previously been placed in 0.3% (v/v) polyethyleneimine (PEI) for 3 h. The filters are washed twice with 4 ml of PBS (4\u00b0 C.), and the bound radioactivity is determined by scintillation measurement. All the assays are carried out in triplicate. The dissociation constant K<sub>i </sub>of the test substance was determined from the IC<sub>50 </sub>of the compounds (concentration of the test substance at which 50% of the ligand bound to the receptor is displaced), the dissociation constant K<sub>D </sub>and the concentration L of [<sup>3</sup>H]-methyllycaconitine using the equation K<sub>i</sub>=IC<sub>50</sub>/(1+L/K<sub>D</sub>).</p>In place of [<sup>3</sup>H]-methyllycaconitine it is also possible to employ other \u03b17 nAChR-selective radioligands such as, for example, [<sup>125</sup>I]-\u03b1-bungarotoxin or nonselective nAChR radioligands together with inhibitors of other nAChRs.</p>The data on the in vitro effects of the compounds of the invention are shown in Table A:</p>TABLE AExample No.K<sub>i </sub>[nM]1120220032804425170</p>The suitability of the compounds of the invention for the treatment of cognitive impairments can be shown in the following animal models:</p>2. Object Recognition Test</p>The object recognition test is a memory test. It measures the ability of rats (and mice) to distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar objects.</p>The test is carried out as described by Blokland et al., NeuroReport 1998, 9, 4205-4208; A. Ennaceur, J. Delacour., Behav. Brain Res. 1988, 31, 47-59; A. Ennaceur, K. Meliani, Psychopharmacology 1992, 109, 321-330; and Prickaerts et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997, 337, 125-136.</p>In a first run, a rat is confronted in an otherwise empty observation arena of relatively large size by two identical objects. The rat will investigate, i.e. sniff round and touch; both objects extensively, In a second run, after an interval of 24 hours, the rat is put in the observation arena again. One of the familiar objects"
