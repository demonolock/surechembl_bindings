The contents were mixed on an orbital shaker for 2 min and incubated at room temperature for 15 min to stabilize luminescent signal. Luminescence was recorded by Envision 2104 Multilabel Reader (PerkinElmer, Santa Clara, Calif.). The number of viable cells in culture was determined based on quantitation of the ATP present in each culture well. The cells in cell culture plate (T=Final) were incubated with the compounds at 37\u00b0 C., 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>for 72 hours. 25 \u03bcL of Cell Titer Glo 2.0 reagent was added to each well. The contents were mixed on an orbital shaker for 2 min and incubated at room temperature for 15 min to stabilize luminescent signal. Luminescence was recorded by Envision 2104 Multilabel Reader (PerkinElmer, Santa Clara, Calif.). The number of viable cells in culture was determined based on quantitation of the ATP present in each culture well. The GI<sub>50 </sub>curves were plotted using the GraphPad Prism 4 program based on a sigmoidal dose-response equation Y=Bottom+(Top-Bottom)/(1+10{circumflex over (\u2003)}((Log EC50\u2212X)*HillSlope)). All parameters in the equation were calculated by GraphPad Prism 4 program. GI<sub>50 </sub>is the concentration of the compound calculated according to [(T<sub>i</sub>\u2212T<sub>z</sub>)/(C\u2212T<sub>z</sub>)]*100=50 where T<sub>i </sub>is the row data of cells with test compounds at T=Final; T<sub>z </sub>is the row data of cells without compounds at T=0 h; C is the row data of cells with control compound staurosporine (Sigma-Aldrich) at T=72 h. Accordingly, GI<sub>50 </sub>is the value of 10<sup>X</sup>, where X was calculated by the Curve Fitting Equation when Y=50 using Excel.</p>Example 42: S9 Stability AssaysCompounds can be assessed for metabolic stability in human skin by assessing their rate of disappearance from human S9 skin fraction.
