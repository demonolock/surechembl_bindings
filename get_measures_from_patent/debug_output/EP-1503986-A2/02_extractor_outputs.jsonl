{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nPreferred compounds of the invention have an AC1.4 less than 10 \u03bcM; and more preferably, less than 1 \u03bcM.\nThe exact concentration of myosin in the assay is also determined empirically, by titration to achieve a desired rate of ATP hydrolysis in the presence of 1 mM EGTA versus that measured in the presence of 0.2 mM CaCI2.\nAssays are performed by first preparing a dilution series of test compound, each with an assay mixture containing potassium Pipes, MgCI2, BSA, DTT, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, myosin subfragment-1 , antifoam, EGTA, CaCI2, and water, at the calcium concentration corresponding to 50% of maximal ATPase activity (pCa50), so a preliminary experiment is performed to test the response of the ATPase activity to free calcium concentrations in the range of 1x10-4 M to 1x10-8 M. \nThe assay mixture is adjusted to the pCaso (typically 3x10-7 M)."}
