    "ropomyosin and troponin are determined empirically, by titration to achieve maximal difference in ATPase activity when measured in the presence of 1 mM EGTA versus that measured in the presence of 0.2 mM CaCI<sub>2</sub>. The exact concentration of myosin in the assay is also determined empirically, by titration to achieve a desired rate of ATP hydrolysis. This varies between protein preparations, due to variations in the fraction of active molecules in each preparation.</p>[0098] Compound dose responses are typically measured at the calcium concentration corresponding to 50% of maximal ATPase activity (pCa<sub>5</sub>o), so a preliminary experiment is performed to test the response of the ATPase activity to free calcium concentrations in the range of IxlO<sup>\"4</sup> M to 1x10<sup>~8</sup> M. Subsequently, the assay mixture is adjusted to the pCaso (typically 3x10<sup>\"7</sup> M). Assays are performed by first preparing a dilution series of test compound, each with an assay mixture containing potassium Pipes, MgCI<sub>2</sub>, BSA, DTT, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, myosin subfragment-1 , antifoam, EGTA, CaCI<sub>2</sub>, and water. The assay is started by adding an equal volume of solution containing potassium Pipes, MgCI<sub>2</sub>, BSA, DTT, ATP, NADH, PEP, actin, tropomyosin, troponin, antifoam, and water. ATP hydrolysis is monitored by absorbance at 340 nm. The resulting dose response curve is fit by the 4 parameter equation y = Bottom + ((Top-Bottom)/(1 +((EC50/X)<sup>\u039b</sup>Hill))). The AC1.4 is defined as the concentration at which ATPase activity is 1.4-fold higher than the bottom of the dose curve.</p>[0099] Preferred compounds of the invention have an AC1.4 less than 10 \u03bcM; and more preferably, less than 1 \u03bcM.</p>[00100] When tested as described above, compounds of Formula I show activity as potentiators of cardiac myosin.</p>S7155P1 WO 37 - \n\n Example 5 Myonyte Hal\u03c0iiim-Contraotility Assay</p>[00101] 5A. PREPARATIONS OF ADULT CARPI AC VFNTRIOUI AR RAT MYOCYTFS</p>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats are anesthetized with a mixture of isoflurane gas and oxygen. Hearts are quickly excised, rinsed and the ascending aorta cannulated. Continuous retrograde perfusion is initiated on the hearts at a perfusion pressure of 60 cm H<sub>2</sub>0. Hearts are first perfused with a nominally Ca <sup>+</sup> free modified Krebs solution of the following composition: 110 mM NaCI, 2.6 mM KCL, 1.2 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 7 H<sub>2</sub>0, 1.2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 2.1 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 11 mM glucose and 4 mM Hepes (all Sigma). This medium is not recirculated and is continually gassed with O<sub>2</sub>. After approximately 3 minutes the heart is perfused with modified Krebs buffer supplemented with 3.3% collagenase (169 \u03bc/mg activity, Class II, Worthington Biochemical Corp., Freehold, NJ) and 25 \u03bcM final calcium concentration until the heart becomes sufficiently blanched and soft. The heart is removed from the cannulae, the atria and "
