using the cDNA of PCR from EST clone (#12) (available from Research Genetics) amplification coding PAK4.Respectively with P33 (ACATATG TCC CATGAGCAGTTCCGGGCTGC CCTGCAGCT) and P34 (CTCA TGGGTGCTTCAGCAGCTCGG CTGCCGTGGC) as 5 ' primer and 3 ' primer among the PCR.The product cloning of pcr amplification is gone into Topo carrier (Invitrogen Inc.) and verify by dna sequencing.Then PAK4 KD subclone is gone into expression plasmid pET28a (+), pET24a (+) or pGST4.5.The recombinant plasmid that will comprise PAK4 KD changes BL21 (DE3) cell over to so that carry out expression of recombinant proteins.Under 27 \u2103, produce by IPTG being added cell induction PAK4 KD.Collecting cell and cracking are so that carry out protein purification then.Ni-NTA post (pET28a (+), pET24a (+)) and gsh post (pGST4.5) are used for purifying.The protein contact zymoplasm that makes purifying then is so that the N-end mark of cracking heredity from expression plasmid and obtain being used for the PAK4 KD that Ki of the present invention measures thus.</p>PAK4 kinase domain enzymatic determination condition: go to the ability of the amino acid side chain that is purchased peptide (aminoacid sequence EVPRRKSLVGTPYWM) according to its catalysis phosphoric acid residue from ribonucleoside triphosphote, determine the enzymatic activity of PAK4 KD.ATP changes into ADP and follows catalyzed reaction.Make PAK4 KD catalytic by ATP generation ADP and the active oxidation NADH coupling of passing through pyruvate kinase (PK) and serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH).Use Molecular DevicesSPECTRAMAX 190 to combine, according at 340nm (e340=6.22cm with Biomec FX\n          <sup>-1</sup>MM\n          <sup>-1</sup>) optical density located descends, monitoring NADH changes into NAD\n          <sup>+</sup>Type reaction solution is included in 50mM HEPES, the 2mM phosphoenolpyruvic acid among the pH 7.5,0.35mMNADH, 10mM MgCl\n          <sub>2</sub>, 1mM DTT, 0.4mM peptide (EVPRRKSLVGTPYWM) 0.04mM ATP, 1 unit/mL PK, 1 unit/mL LDH, 0.01% polysorbas20.Start mensuration by adding 25nM PAK4 KD.Based on the multiple of the inhibition of inhibitor under different inhibitor concentration quantity per-cent, calculate the PAK KD Ki of each compound of the present invention (inhibitor).Peptide (amino sequence EVPRRKSLVGTPYWM) is available from American Peptide Company.NADH, MgCl\n          <sub>2</sub>, HEPES, DTT, ATP and PK/LDH be available from Sigma.Polysorbas20 is available from Calbiochem.\n        </p>The PAK4 kinase activity that the sandwich ELISA method is used for measuring intact cell.Can be by monitoring phosphoric acid specific antibody and GEF-H1b combine the PAK4-dependency phosphorylation level of mensuration GEF-H1b.Improved HEK 293 clones be used for biological assay and with its transformation so that the kinase domain of overexpression GEF-H1b and PAK4 (KD).The KD of PAK4 can (Trex system Invitrogen) induces by tsiklomitsin in this clone.With the name nominating of this clone is TR-293-KDG.In order to set up the phosphorylation event on the GEF-H1, use the Vibravenos inducing cell so that express PAK4 KD.Negative control hole is not accepted to induce.The candidate substances effect is determined as the ability of this phosphorylation event of blocking-up.</p>Dull and stereotyped by wrapping quilt in advance with trapping antibody (\u03b1-HA-mark mouse monoclonal antibody), preparation ELISA flat board, 0.1% polysorbas20 that seals and be used in the tris-buffer saline (TBST) with BSA washs.Give tissue culture plate (being coated with poly--D-Methionin in advance) inoculation TR-293-KDG cell.Induce the TR-293-KDG cell so that expression PAK4 KD spends the night and handled 3-hour Continuous Contact subsequently with simultaneously with candidate substances or thinner again with Vibravenos.Then with the improved RIPA damping fluid lysing cell that has replenished proteinase inhibitor.Then fresh cell lysate was joined in the ELISA flat board 2-hour.With TBST flat board is washed 4 times between all later step.Add to detect antibody (the phosphoric acid specificity epitope on the identification GEF-H1b) 1 hour, add goat \u03b1-rabbit two antibody 45 minutes that enzyme connects subsequently.(Moss, Inc.) antibody that enzyme is connected develops the color, and hatches the back at 30 minutes and uses spectrophotometer to read the optical density at 405nM place to use peroxidase substrate ABTS.By the sigmoid curve match of using the 4-parameter to analyze, calculate the EC50 value.</p>The PAK4
