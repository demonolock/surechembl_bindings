    "ere all within normal limits. Low prostate: body weight and prostate:brain weight ratios (52-62% at all dose levels) were noted for Compound 1 male dogs vs. the corresponding vehicle control group in the 14-day study. However, in the absence of light microscopic changes in this organ, this was not considered a direct effect of Compound 1, and may have been a spurious result due to the sexual immaturity of the young animals used in this study. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was thus considered the highest dosage tested in both species: 600 mg/kg/day in rats and 200 mg/kg/day in dogs.</p>The potential for genetic toxicology was tested using standard GLP bacterial mutation (Ames), Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) chromosome aberration, and in vivo mouse micronucleus assays: Compound 1 was negative in all tests. Data from safety pharmacology studies (ICH S7A/S7B battery) suggest that oral formulations of Compound 1 are unlikely to cause adverse effects on gastrointestinal, respiratory, CNS, or cardiovascular systems in the treatment of CF patients. With the exception of the preliminary 7-day toxicity studies, all studies were performed according to GLP regulations.</p>In Vitro Studies</p>Compound 1 was counter screened against a broad panel of enzymes and receptors using radiolabel binding studies (see MDS Pharma Services, LeadProfiling and SpectrumScreen, MDSPS PT#: 1083321). Binding activity was observed only for the Thromboxane A2 (TXA2) receptor (TP receptor) with a Ki of \u02dc3 \u03bcM. In an in vitro functional assay of TP receptor function using rat aorta, Compound 1 was demonstrated to be a TP receptor antagonist with an IC50 between 1 and 10 \u03bcM. However, there have been no cardiovascular or respiratory findings in safety pharmacology studies, suggesting that Compound 1 has no TP receptor antagonist effect in vivo, despite achieving very high systemic exposures at oral doses up to 1000 mg/kg in the rat and 200 mg/kg in the dog.</p>In CF patients, platelet aggregability and TXA2 release is increased, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of bronchoconstriction (O'Sullivan et al., (2005) Blood 105:4635, Stead et al., (1987) Prostaglandins Leukot Med 26:91). The potential TP receptor antagonism of Compound 1 may provide therapeutic benefit in CF patients by preventing TXA2-induced bronchoconstriction.</p>The effect of Compound 1 on hERG, the cardiac K+ channel responsible for membrane repolarization, was analyzed using a variety of electrophysiological techniques. There was no evidence of a hERG IC50 value below 30 \u03bcM in any of these assays, consistent with the lack of hERG channel competitive binding (4% inhibition of 3H-astemizole binding at 10 \u03bcM). These findings suggest a low potential for hERG inhibition and its associated QT interval prolongation in vivo.</p>Single Dose Toxicity Studies</p>Single oral doses of 500, 1000, or 2000 mg/kg Compound 1 in mice and rats (total dose volume of 20 mL/kg, formulated as a suspension in 0.5% Tween80+0.5% MC in water) resulted in no unscheduled deaths and no significant clinical observations during a 14-day observation period post-dose and were considered well tolerated. There were no effects on organ weights and no gross observations (macroscopic findings) noted at necropsy. Both the maximum tolerated dose(MTD) and no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in the acute studies in rats and mice were considered to be &gt;2000 mg/kg.</p>Mean toxicokinetic parameters at the MTD/NOAEL for both species are summarized in Table 1.</p>TABLE 1Mean Values for Selected Non-Compartmental Toxicokinetic.Parameters for Compound 1 at the MTD/NOAEL for AcuteOral Toxicity Study in Mice and Rats at 2000 mg/kg.DoseAUC<sub>0-24 h</sub>C<sub>max</sub>t<sub>max</sub>Species(mg/kg)Gender(\u03bcg * hr/mL)(\u03bcg/mL)(hr)Mice2000Female28993251Male26782641Rats2000Female675030510Male610630624</p>Compound 1 was well absorbed in mice with time to reach maximum plasma concentrations (t<sub>max</sub>) ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 hr.
