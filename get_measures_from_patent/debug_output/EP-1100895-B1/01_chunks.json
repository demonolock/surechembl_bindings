    "presses cellular cholesterol efflux as effectively as AN-1 implies that both of these oligonucleotides are complementary to ABC1 coding sequences, and that the amino terminal 60 amino acids are likely to be contained in ABC1 protein. In contrast, the ineffectiveness of AN-8 shows that it is likely to be outside the protein coding region of the transcript, as predicted by presence of an in-frame stop codon between the initiator methionine and the region targeted by AN-8.</p>Antibody experimentsPolyclonal and monoclonal antibodies have been generated using peptides corresponding to discrete portions of the ABC1 amino acid sequence. One of these, 20-amino acid peptide #2 (Pep2: CSVRLSYPPYEQHECHFPNKA (SEQ ID NO: 37), in which the N-terminal cysteine was added to facilitate conjugation of the peptide) corresponds to a protein sequence within the 60 amino-terminal amino acids of the newly-discovered ABC1 protein sequence. The peptide was coupled to the KLH carrier protein and 300 \u00b5g injected at three intervals into two Balb/c mice over a four week period. The spleen was harvested from the mouse with the highest ELISA-determined immune response to free peptide, and the cells fused to NS-1 myeloma cells by standard monoclonal antibody generation methods. Positive hybridomas were selected first by ELISA and then further characterized by western blotting using cultured primary human fibroblasts. Monoclonal cell lines producing a high antibody titre and specifically recognizing the 245 kD human ABC1 protein were saved. The same size ABC1 protein product was detected by antibodies directed to four other discrete regions of the same protein. The 245 kD band could be eliminated in competition experiments with appropriate free peptide, indicating that it represents ABC1 protein (Fig. 13).</p>The foregoing experiments indicate that ABC1 protein is detected not only by antibodies corresponding to amino acid sequences within the previously-described ABC1 amino acid sequence, but also by the Pep2 monoclonal antibody that recognizes an epitope within the newly-discovered N-terminal 60 amino acids. The N-terminal 60 amino acid region is therefore coding, and is part of the ABC1 protein.</p>The epitope recognized by the Pep2 monoclonal antibody is also conserved among human, mouse, and chicken. Liver tissues from these three species employed in a Western blot produced an ABC1 band of 245 kD when probed with the Pep2 monoclonal antibody. This indicates that the 60 amino acid N-terminal sequence is part of the ABC1 coding sequence in humans, mice, and chickens. Presence of this region is therefore evolutionarily conserved and likely to be of important functional significance for the ABC1 protein.</p>Bioinformatic analyses of ABC1 protein sequencesTransmembrane prediction programs indicate 13 transmembrane (TM) regions, the first one being between amino acids 26 and 42 (http://psort.nibb.ac.jp:8800/psort/helpwww2.html#ealom). The tentative number of TM regions for the threshold 0.5 is 13. (INTEGRAL Likelihood = -7.75 Transmembrane 26-42). The other 12 TM range in value between -0.64 and -12 (full results below). It is therefore very likely that the newly-discovered 60 amino acids contain a TM domain, and that the amino end of ABC1 may be on the opposite side of the membrane than originally thought.\nALOM: TM region allocation\nInit position for calculation: 1Tentative number of TMs for the threshold 0.5: 13INTEGRAL Likelihood = -7.75 Transmembrane 26 - 42INTEGRAL Likelihood = -3.98 Transmembrane 640 - 656INTEGRAL Likelihood =-8.70 Transmembrane 690-706INTEGRAL Likelihood =-9.61 Transmembrane 717 - 733INTEGRAL Likelihood =-1.44 Transmembrane 749 - 765INTEGRAL Likelihood = -0.64 Transmembrane 771 - 787INTEGRAL Likelihood = -1.28 Transmembrane 1041 -1057INTEGRAL Likelihood =-12.79 Transmembrane 1351 -1367INTEGRAL Likelihood = -8.60 Transmembrane 1661 -1677INTEGRAL Li"
