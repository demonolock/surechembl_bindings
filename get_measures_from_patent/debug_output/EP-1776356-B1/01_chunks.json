As a result, one or more inflammatory process, such as leukocyte emigration, adhesion, chemotaxis, exocytosis (e.g., of enzymes, histamine) or inflammatory mediator release, is inhibited. For example, eosinophilic infiltration to inflammatory sites (e.g., in asthma or allergic rhinitis) can be inhibited according to the present method. In particular, t",
    "Ascariasis, Hookworm, Strongyloidiasis, Trichinosis, filariasis) ; trematodes (flukes) (Schistosomiasis, Clonorchiasis), cestodes (tape worms) (Echinococcosis, Taeniasis saginata, Cysticercosis); visceral worms, visceral larva migraines (e.g., Toxocara), eosinophilic gastroenteritis (e.g., Anisaki sp., Phocanema sp.), cutaneous larva migraines (Ancylostona braziliense, Ancylostoma caninum). The compounds of the present invention are accordingly useful in the prevention and treatment of a wide variety of inflammatory, infectious and immunoregulatory disorders and diseases. In addition, treatment of the aforementioned inflammatory, allergic and autoimmune diseases can also be contemplated for promoters of chemokine receptor function if one contemplates the delivery of sufficient compound to cause the loss of receptor expression on cells through the induction of chemokine receptor internalization or delivery of compound in a manner that results in the misdirection of the migration of cells.</p>In another aspect, the instant invention may be used to evaluate the putative specific agonists or antagonists of a G protein coupled receptor. The present invention is directed to the use of these compounds in the preparation and execution of screening assays for compounds that modulate the activity of chemokine receptors. Furthermore, the compounds of this invention are useful in establishing or determining the binding site of other compounds to chemokine receptors, e.g., by competitive inhibition or as a reference in an assay to compare its known activity to a compound with an unknown activity. When developing new assays or protocols, compounds according to the present invention could be used to test their effectiveness.</p>Specifically, such compounds may be provided in a commercial kit, for example, for use in pharmaceutical research involving the aforementioned diseases. The compounds of the instant invention are also useful for the evaluation of putative specific modulators of the chemokine receptors. In addition, one could utilize compounds of this invention to examine the specificity of G protein coupled receptors that are not thought to be chemokine receptors, either by serving as examples of compounds which do not bind or as structural variants of compounds active on these receptors which may help define specific sites of interaction.</p>The CCR-3 receptor binding test is based on a K562 cell line (leukemia myelogenic blast cells ) transfected with the human chemokine receptor CCR-3 ( hCCR-3-C1 ).\nThe cell membranes were prepared by disrupting the hCCR-3 transfected K562 cells by nitrogen decomposition and centrifugation at 40000 g , 4 \u00b0C for 1h. The membranes were re-suspended in the SPA incubation buffer without bovine serum albumin for storage in aliquots at -80 \u00b0C .</p>The CCR-3 receptor binding assay with the radioligand <sup>125</sup>Jodine-eotaxin-1 was performed in a Scintillation Proximity Assay ( SPA ) design. Cell membranes of hCCR-3 C1 cells were diluted in suitable concentrations ( 0.5 -5 ug protein / well ) in 96 well microtiter plates ( 1450-401, Wallac).</p>The test incubation mixture comprising 60 \u00b5l of the membrane suspension, 80 \u00b5l of the Wheat Germ Agglutinin coated PVT beads (organic scintillator, Amersham Pharmacia biotech) in a concentration of 0,4 mg and 40 \u00b5l of radiolabelled <sup>125</sup>J rhEotaxin (Amersham, IM290) were incubated with 20 \u00b5l of the test compound (dissolved in DMSO dilutions ) for 2 hours. The SPA incubation buffer contained 25mM HEPES, 25mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> 6xH<sub>2</sub>O, 1mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2xH<sub>2</sub>O and 0,1% bovine serum albumin . Included were controls for specific binding ( no displacer added ) and non-specific binding by adding unlabelled rhEotaxin (R&amp;D Systems) or a test compound. Bound radioactivity was determined by scintillation counter (Micro Beta \"Trilux\", Wallac).\nDetermination of affinity of test compounds ( dissociation constant K<sub>i</sub> ) was calculated by iterative fitting of experimental data using the law of mass action based program \"easy sys\" (Schittkowski, Num Math 68, 129-142 (1994)).</p>The utility of the compounds in accordance with the present invention as modulators of chemokine receptor activity may be demonstrated by methodology known in the art, such as the assays for CCR-2 and CCR-3 ligand binding, as disclosed by Ponath et al., J. Exp. Med., 183,2437-2448 (1996) and Uguccioni et al., J. Clin. Invest., 100,11371143 (1997). Cell lines for expressing the receptor of interest include those naturally expressing the chemokine receptor, such as EOL-3 or THP-1, those induced to express the chemokine receptor by the addition of chemical or protein agents, such as HL-60 or AML14.3D10 cells treated with, for example, butyric acid with interleukin-5 present, or a cell engineered to express a recombinant chemokine receptor, such as CHO or HEK-293. Finally, blood or tissue cells, for example human peripheral blood eosinophils, isolated using methods as described by Hansel et al., J. Immunol. Methods, 145,105-110 (1991), can be utilized in such assays. In particular, the compounds of the present invention have activity in binding to the CCR-3 receptor in the aforementioned assays. As used herein, \"activity\" is intended to mean a compound demonstrating an IC50 of 10 MM or lower in concentration when measured in the aforementioned assays. Such a result is indicative of the intrinsic activity of the compounds as modulators of chemokine receptor activity.</p>PHARMACEUTICAL FORMSThe compounds are administered to a mammal in a therapeutically effective amount. By \"therapeutically effective amount\" it is meant an amount of a compound of formula 1a that, when administered alone or in combination with an additional therapeutic agent to a mammal, is effective to prevent or ameliorate diseases, wherein the activity of a CCR-3-receptor is involved, or the progression of this disease.</p>The compounds of this invention can be administered in such oral dosage forms as tablets, capsules (each of which includes sustained release or timed release formulations), pills, powders, granules, elixirs, tinctures, suspensions, syrups, and emulsions. They may also be administered in intravenous (bolus or infusion), intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, or intramuscular form, all using dosage forms well known to those of ordinary skill in the pharmaceutical arts. They can be administered alone, but generally will be administered with a pharmaceutical carrier selected on the basis of the chosen route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice.</p>The dosage regimen for the compounds of the present invention will, of course, vary depending upon known factors, such as the pharmacodynamic characteristics of the particular agent and its mode and route "
