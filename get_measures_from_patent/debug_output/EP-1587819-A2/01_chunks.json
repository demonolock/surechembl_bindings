    "residues, and those larger than 7 amino acid residues, showing a high degree of homology among them.</p>\n  Research in this specific field showed that a large variety of applications can be found for toxins, particularly the venom toxins of serpents, or the modifications of some of these molecules, such as the bradykinin potentiating peptides (BPPs), which can be specific agents of anti-hypertensive action in mammals, including man.</p>\n  The amino acid sequence of other bradykinin potentiating peptides, having high degree of homology with the amino acid sequence of BPPs, were not obtained from the venom of snakes. In fact, these were deducted from the nucleotide sequences of their precursors found in other serpent tissues, such as the brain, pancreas and spleen \n\ntissue, using molecular biology techniques. These endogenous peptides, in their synthetic form, like the BPPs secreted from the venom gland of the Bothrops jararaca, acting on the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) of the vascular endothelium, preventing the formation of angiotensin II (hypertensive) and preserving the hypotensive action of bradykinin.</p>\n  The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is a peptidase with two catalytic sites (carboxy- or C-site, and amino- or N-site) , which are mainly located to the cytoplasmic membrane of endothelial cells. The C-terminal active site is more specific for angiotensin I and bradykinin. The BPPs act by inhibiting the ACE and, up to this invention, the specificity of the inhibition of the C- or N-sites was unknown, and the result of this inhibition is the reduction of arterial blood pressure.</p>\n  Inhibition of the ACE, not selective for a specific active sites, led to the development of the site-directed inhibitor called captopril. The N site metabolizes the natural circulating peptide hormone (Ac - Ser - Asp - Lys - Pro) , which regulates he atopoiesis . The carboxylic domain of the enzyme (C site) is more specific for convertion of angiotensin I into angiotensin II and inactivates bradykinin. Up to this moment, it was not known whether all the described BPPs presented any preference for the C site, turning them into more specific antihypertensive agents .</p>\n  There still are a number of unknown toxins from the the venoms of snakes, which may have the potential to act as anti-hypertensive agents . These molecules may not only inhibit specifically the C-site of the ACE, but even, and simultaneously, inhibit other peptidases of the vascular \n\nendotheliu , as the neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and the endothelin converting enzyme (ECE) . The ECE inactivates bradykinin, natriuretic peptides, hypotensive agents, and generates endothelins (hypertensive) . The ACE, NEP and ECE are known as vasopeptidases, and are responsible for most of the arterial blood pressure control. These double and/or triple inhibitors are not only more specific, but also more efficient because they act on the metabolism of endogenous molecules regulating the arterial blood pressure. The distinction between the two catalytic sites of the ACE has been well-defined in: Dive, V.; Cotton J.; Yiotakis, M. A.; Vassiliou, S.; Jiracek, &lt;T. ; Vazeaux, G.,- Chauvet, G.; Cuniasse, P.; Corvol; JRXP 407 <sub>r</sub> a phosphinic peptide, is a potent inhibitor of angiotensin I converting enzyme able to differentiate between i ts two active sites . Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 13, 4330-4335, (1999) .</p>\n  It is known from the scientific literature that some peptides from the venom of Brazilian and Asian serpents, presenting hypotensive action, have already been isolated and sequenced (Ondetti &amp; Cushman, Ann.Rev.Biochem. 51, 293 - 308, 1982), and that the antihyperstensive efficiency of one of them has been demonstrated in humans (Gravas et al. N. Engl. J. Med. 291, 817 - 821, 1974) .</p>\n  Several BPPs have been deduced from the amino acid sequences of their precursors using molecular biology techniques (Murayama et. al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 94, 1189 - 1193, 1997) .</p>\n  The pharmaceutical industry developed a new antihypertensive drug of non-peptidic nature and without any chemical analogies with endogenous molecules. It was called OMOPATRILAT, displaying inhibition properties for both the ACE and the NEP, presenting long-term anti- hypertensive efficiency in rats with high concentration of circulating renin. Besides, this substance improves cardiac \n\nperformance, prolonging the survival of spontenously hypertensive rats, SUR, a model for human essential hypertension. The OM\u0391PATRILAT is the first site-directed inhibitor for two vasopeptidases, the ACE and NEP, in advanced phase of clinical trials.</p>\n  The major differences between the OM\u0391PATRILAT and the BPPs and EVASINS are:</p>\n  1- the BPPs and EVASINS are of polypeptidic nature;</p>\n  2- they are synthetic molecules identical or homolog to peptides secreted by exocrine glands, or endogenously produced in vertebrates;</p>\n  3- as ACE inhibitors, the BPPs and EVASINS of 8 to 13 amino acid residues show preference for the C-site, and also inhibit the NEP X; 4- they are degraded mainly by humoral and tissue proteolytic enzymes;</p>\n  The US 55389991 patent, published July 23<sup>rd</sup>, 1996, and the US 5559135 patent, published September 24<sup>th</sup>, 1996, describe the inhibitor secreted by serpent venom glands - PCA-W-P-R-P-E-I-P-P- SQ 20881 - an ACE inhibitor, which consequently reduces the arterial blood pressure in animals, and which showed efficient reduction of arterial blood pressure in hypertensive individuals. However, these patents do no describe or reveal the specificity of action of this inhibitor on one or the two catalytic sites of the ACE. The patents d",
    " peptides, used as such, or chemically modified in order to maintain the characteristics described above, can be useful as therapeutic agents in the treatment of cardiovascular disorders or in local circulatory actions, particularly in \n\nhypertensive disorders in humans and other cardiovascular disorders .</p>\n  Twenty-two (22) BPPs found in the venom and in tissues of Bothrops jararaca, were sequenced by mass spectrometry, or their sequences were deduced from cDNA sequences of the precursors of those molecules expressed in the tissues of the serpent. The corresponding synthetic peptides were tested as inhibitors of the C-site of the recombinant ACE and of NEP, and also both as potentiating agents of the bradykinin contractile activity on isolated guinea pig ileum, and as bradykinin hypotensive activity in rats. They were found both as BPPs (secreted) and as EVASINS (endogenous) . They can be divided in two groups according to the specificity of action on the C site of the ACE: a) non-specific. One peptide, the pentapeptide &lt;E K W A P (Pyroglutamyl (&lt;E) -Lysine (K) - tryptophane (W) - Alanine (A) - Proline (P) , which, although not presenting a defined selectivity for the C-site of the ACE, presents high potentiating activity of bradykinin, as observed on the preparation of isolated smooth muscle as well as by its hypotensive effect. It was found as BPP (secreted from the serpent venom glands) as well as EVASINS (endogenous, from the serpent brain tissue) . It presents Ki values in the \u03bcM range, for both the N and C sites of the ACE. It also inhibits, with low affinity, the NEP with Ki values ranging from 50-150 \u03bcM. It potentiates the contractile action of bradykinin on isolated guinea pig ileum with concentrations that vary from 15-300 nM. The hypotensive effect of bradykinin was also potentiated by 60% in concentrations of 300 nM, showing a 5-fold (five) increase in the duration of the hypotensive effect, when compared to the duration of the effect of bradykinin alone. \n\n b) specific. These peptides present molecular masses ranging from 1000 to 1700 Daltons, containing 8 to 13 amino acid residues. In this group, the most selective and effective potentiators of the contractile action of the bradykinin on isolated guinea pig ileum and on rat arterial blood pressure, were found as BPPs or EVASINS. They were chemically modified generating other peptides with similar pharmacological properties .</p>\n  The table 1 below presents the synthetic oligonucleotides derived from the inhibitors described in group b) for this present invention:</p>\n  Table 1</p>\n  Formula Sequences</p>\n  I pp<sup>1</sup>aa<sup>1</sup>aa<sup>2</sup>aa<sup>3</sup>P<sup>4</sup>aa<sup>5</sup>aa<sup>6</sup>P P<sup>8</sup></p>\n  II pp<sup>1</sup>aa<sup>1</sup>aa<sup>2</sup>aa<sup>3</sup>aa<sup>4</sup>P<sup>5</sup>aa<sup>6</sup>aa<sup>7</sup>P<sup>8</sup>P<sup>9</sup></p>\n  III pp<sup>\u03b1</sup>aa<sup>\u03b1</sup>aa<sup>2</sup>aa<sup>3</sup>aa aa<sup>5</sup>P<sup>6</sup>aa<sup>7</sup>aa<sup>8</sup>P<sup>9</sup>P<sup>10</sup></p>\n  IV pp<sup>1</sup>aa<sup>1</sup>aa<sup>2</sup>aa<sup>3</sup>aa<sup>4<",

These peptides are also inhibitors of NEP with Ki values ranging from 5 to 150 \u03bcM. All of them potentiate the contractile activity of bradykinin on the isolated guinea pig ileum, doubling the contractile effect of bradykinin, in concentrations varying from 5 to 300 nM. The hypotensive effect of bradykinin was also potentiated by 30-80% in concentrations varying from 10-700 nM, increasing the duration of this hypotensive effect from 5 to 15 fold, as compared to bradykinin alone . The present invention proposes for the first time: an isolation and purification procedure for vasopeptidase peptide inhibitors with anti-hypertensive action, secreted by serpent venom glands, particularly Bothrops jararaca, comprising the following steps: A - ISOLATION AND PURIFICATION OF BPPs FROM THE VENOM OF Bothrops jararaca :</p>\n  800 to 1500 g of total venom obtained from a venom pool of Bothrops jararaca were dissolved in 7.0 to 15 ml of deionized water and centrifuged at 1500 to 2000 rp for 15 to 30 minutes; the supernatant was removed and applied to a 1.2 x 101 cm Sephadex G-25 M gel filtration column (25-80 \u03bc, Sigma) ; the column was equilibrated with ammonium acetate buffer (30 to 50 mM, pH 5.0 to 6.0) at room temperature. The sample was added to the top of the column and the components were eluted at a flow rate of 1.0 to 2.0 mL/min. The absorbance profile for each aliquot at 214 n defined the constitution of the pools, based on the bradykinin potentiating activity on guinea pig ileum.

(Figure 1) . By analogy to the BPPs isolated from the venom of Bothrops jararaca, 1 peptides were identified, whose sequences are listed among those in table 1) . Based on these sequences, peptides were synthesized that presented the same pharmacological \n\n properties as the venom peptides, as well as inhibition of ECA and NEP.</p>\n  Figure 1 shows the primary sequence of the EVASINS precursor from Bothrops jararaca brain, deduced from the corresponding cDNA sequence. Abbreviations for the nucleotides: A-adenosine; C-cytidine; G-guanosine; T- thymidine. CNP- Type C natriuretic peptide. Nucleotide sequence of the cDNA encoding the precursor protein of the EVASINS and CNP, isolated from the cDNA library from Bothrops jararaca brain, and the deduced amino acid sequence. The amino acid sequences of the EVASINS are underlined and the CNP sequence is shown in bold.</p>\n  Another aspect of the invention is the procedure for the synthesis of the peptides in solid phase, using two specific strategies:</p>\n  A - Use of the tert-butyloxycarbonyl group (Boc) as a temporary protector for the amino group and of benzyl derivatives (Bzl) for the protection of most of the amino acid reactive side chains. - The first step in this synthesis strategy is to remove the Boc group from the first amino acid residue, bound to the resin.</p>\n  Removal of the Boc group occurs in 30% TFA in dichloromethane (DCM) , containing 2% anisole, for 30 min. The resin is then washed successively with isopropanol containing 0.5% anisole, DCM and MeOH. For the next amino acid coupling, the amino group is deprotonated by treatment with TEA 10% or DIPEA 5% in DCM for 10 min. The peptidyl- resin is then washed with DCM, MeOH, DCM and with the solvent used for the coupling.</p>\n  Coupling of the amino acid starts wit",

Seven peptides (the sequences of which are listed among those in table 1) were identified by analogy with the BPPs isolated from the venom of Bothrops jararaca . Based on these sequences, peptides were synthesized that presented the same pharmacological \n\nproperties as the venom peptides, as well as inhibition of ECA and NEP. Example 5 :</p>\n  Testing the bradykinin potentiating activity of the BPPs and EVASINS:</p>\n  Biological assay on guinea pig ileum:</p>\n  The potentiating activity of the pools of isolated peptides was tested on the contractile activity of bradykinin on smooth muscle, measured using a preparation of isolated guinea pig ileum. Female guinea pigs with a body weight between 160 and 180 g were used. Before starting the assays, the ileum was kept in TYRODE solution at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. One of the ends of the isolated ileum segment, measuring 1.5 to 2.0 cm, was tied to a semi-ring located at the bottom of a glass container with a capacity of 5 i\u03b1L, containing the TYRODE physiological solution at 37\u00b0C under constant oxygen bubbling through a capillary. The other extremity of the ileum segment was tied to a previously calibrated registering arm. The tension on the arm was of 1 g, and the ileum contractions were recorded by an REC101 recorder (Pharmacia Biotech) .</p>\n  The samples were prepared in deionized water at the time of use, and the volume used for the biological preparation did not exceed 0.2 L. In order to determine the bradykinin potentiating effect of the samples, a log-dose curve of the effect of bradykinin on the ileum was plotted. Bradykinin activity was determined by measuring the contractions of the isolated guinea pig ileum, and the potentiating activity was expressed as a function of the increase in tissue response to a standard dose of br",
    "sponse to a standard dose of bradykinin. TYRODE solution: 20 mL of stock solution I, 40 L of the solution II, 1 mL of difenidramine solution (1 mg/mL) , 1 mL of atropine solution (1 mg/mL), 5.60 mM D-glucose and H<sub>2</sub>0 to 1 L.</p>\n  All reagents used in this experiment were of analytic grade. Example 6 : Effect on the systemic blood circulation and microcirculation</p>\n  The hypotensive potentiating activity effect of bradykinin was tested in normotensive and hypertensive male and female Wistar rats, anesthetized with ethylic ether; a cannulae was introduced in the femoral vein for drug administration and in the femoral artery for blood pressure recording. A Gould polygraph was used coupled to a Statham Gould physiological transducer. The arterial pressure variation values were obtained by integration of the areas delimited by the pressure base line, and by comparing them with the values obtained in the control experiment. Toxin effect tests were carried out in normotensive and hypertensive rats by intra-vital microscopy using the mesenteric circulation. The animals were anesthetized, and their body temperature maintained by a heated plate, while the mesentery was trans-illuminated and observed through lenses coupled to a television camera. The vase diameters of these animals were measured with a icrometric screw. Tested substances were administered by a constant flow peristaltic pump or injected in bolus. Example 7</p>\n  Enzymatic assays for the determination of ACE inhibition by the BPPs. \n\n The wild-type human angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and two mutants, containing only one functional active site, were obtained through stable transfection of Chinese hamster ovary cells with the ACE encoding cDNA. The two ACE mutants were expressed as full-length proteins, presenting one of the catalytic sites, N- or C- terminal, inactivated by substitution of the zinc binding histidine residues by lysine residues.</p>\n  The enzymatic assays were carried out at 25\u00b0C with the substrate Mca-Ala-Ser-Asp-Lys-DpaOH, in a 50 mM Hepes buffer, pH 6.8, containing 200 mM NaCl and 10 \u03bcM ZnCl<sub>2</sub>. The reactions were continuously monitored by determining the raise in fluorescence at 390 nm emission wave length, and excitation at 340 nm, caused by the cleavage of the substrate (S = Km, 40 \u03bcM) by ACE, in a fluorimeter Fluorolite 10000 (Dynatech) . The bradykinin potentiating peptides (BPPs) (inhibitors, were pre-incubated with the enzyme 90 min before the addition of the substrate. Example 8 : Characterization of the effect of the BPPs in vivo - arterial blood pressure and microcirculation</p>\n  Wistar male rats with a body weight between 180 and 220 g were anesthetized with sodic pentabarbital (Hypnol<sup>\u00ae</sup> Cristalia, 50 mg/kg of body weight, intraperitoneally) , while the body temperature was maintained between 36.5\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C by a heated plate. After tracheotomy, the ventilation of the animals was controlled by a mechanical ventilator (Harvard"
