    "yzes the production of ADP from ATP that accompanies the phosphoryl transfer to the substrate peptide 5-FAM-Dyrktide (5-FAM-RRRFRPASPLRGPPK) (SEQ ID NO:2). The mobility shift assay electrophoretically separates the fluorescently labeled peptides (substrate and phosphorylated product) following the kinase reaction. Both substrate and product are measured and the ratio of these values is used to generate % conversion of substrate to product by the LabChip EZ Reader. Typical reaction solutions contained 2% DMSO (\u00b1inhibitor), 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 2 mM ATP, 0.005% Tween 20 (TW-20), 3 \u03bcM 5-FAM-Dyrktide, 3 nM (active sites) CDK6/Cyclin D1 in 40 mM HEPES buffer at pH 7.5.</p>Inhibitor K<sub>i </sub>determinations for non-phosphorylated CDK6/CyclinD1 (LJIC-2003A2/1865) were initiated with the addition of ATP (50 \u03bcL final reaction volume), following a twelve minute pre-incubation of enzyme and inhibitor at 22\u00b0 C. in the reaction mix. The reaction was stopped after 35 minutes by the addition of 50 \u03bcL of 25 mM EDTA. K<sub>i </sub>determinations were made from a plot of the fractional velocity as a function of inhibitor concentration fit to the Morrison equation with the enzyme concentration as a variable.</p>For CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6 mobility shift assays, see also Morrison, J.
