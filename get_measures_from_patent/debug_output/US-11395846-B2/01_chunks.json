The antigen binding site is formed by amino acid residues of the N-terminal variable (\u201cV\u201d) regions of the heavy (\u201cH\u201d) and light (\u201cL\u201d) chains. Three highly divergent stretches within the V regions of the heavy and light chains are referred to as \u201chypervariable regions\u201d which are interposed between more conserved flanking stretches known as \u201cframework regions,\u201d or \u201cFRs\u201d. Thus the term \u201cFR\u201d refers to amino acid sequences which are naturally found between and adjacent to hypervariable regions in immunoglobulins. In an antibody molecule, the three hypervariable regions of a light chain and the three hypervariable regions of a heavy chain are disposed relative to each other in three dimensional space to form an antigen-binding surface. The antigen-binding surface is complementary to the three-dimensional surface of a bound antigen, and the three hypervariable regions of each of the heavy and light chains are referred to as \u201ccomplementarity-determining regions,\u201d or \u201cCDRs.\u201d</p>As used herein, the terms \u201cimmuno-specific,\u201d \u201cimmunological binding\u201d and \u201cimmunological binding properties\u201d refer to the non-covalent interactions of the type which occur between an immunoglobulin molecule and an antigen for which the immunoglobulin is specific. The strength, or affinity of immunological binding interactions can be expressed in terms of the dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) of the interaction, wherein a smaller K<sub>d </sub>represents a greater affinity. Immunological binding properties of selected polypeptides can be quantified using methods well known in the art. One such method entails measuring the rates of antigen-binding site/antigen complex formation and dissociation, wherein those rates depend on the concentrations of the complex partners, the affinity of the interaction, and on geometric parameters that equally influence the rate in both directions. Thus, both the \u201con rate constant\u201d (K<sub>on</sub>) and the \u201coff rate constant\u201d (K<sub>off</sub>) can be determined by calculation of the concentrations and the actual rates of association and dissociation. The ratio of K<sub>off</sub>/K<sub>on </sub>enables cancellation of all parameters not related to affinity, and is thus equal to the dissociation constant K<sub>d</sub>. See, generally, Davies et al. (1990) Annual Rev. Biochem. 59:439-473.</p>A number of therapeutically useful molecules are known in the art which comprise antigen-binding sites that are capable of exhibiting immunological binding properties of an antibody molecule. The proteolytic enzyme papain preferentially cleaves IgG molecules to yield several fragments, two of which (the \u201cF(ab)\u201d fragments) each comprise a covalent heterodimer that includes an intact antigen-binding site. The enzyme pepsin is able to cleave IgG molecules to provide several fragments, including the \u201cF(ab\u2032)2\u201d fragment which comprises both antigen-binding sites. An \u201cFv\u201d fragment can be produced by preferential proteolytic cleavage of an IgM, and on rare occasions IgG or IgA immunoglobulin molecule. Fv fragments are, however, more commonly derived using recombinant techniques known in the art. The Fv fragment includes a non-covalent VH::VL heterodimer including an antigen-binding site which retains much of the antigen recognition and binding capabilities of the native antibody molecule.

(1980) Biochem 19:4091-4096.</p>A single chain Fv (\u201csFv\u201d) polypeptide is a covalently linked VH::VL heterodimer which is expressed from a gene fusion including VH- and VL-encoding genes linked by a peptide-encoding linker.
