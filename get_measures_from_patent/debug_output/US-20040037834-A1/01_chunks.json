    "s of many tissues, with wound repair, tumour invasion and cellular immune function (Boudreau et al., 1991; Iozzo, 1985; Pauli et al., 1983; Toole, 1982; Toole et al., 1989; Turley, 1984, 1992; Weigel et al., 1986, 1989). Increased levels of HA have been documented in rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, fibrosis of the liver, and in cancer cells (Ichida et al., 1996, Laurent et al., 1986). The underlying mechanism of action at the cellular level is believed to involve the ability of HA to elicit receptor-mediated alterations of cell motility. </p>[0004] High affinity HA receptors have been identified and characterized on a variety of cell types and these are namely the receptor for HA mediated mobility (or RHAMM) (Turley, E. A. et al., 1991; Hardwick, C. et al., 1992; Yang, B. et al., 1993), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (or ICAM-1) (McCourt, P. A. G. et al., 1994) and CD44 (Underhill, C. B. et al., 1987; Stamenkovic, I. et al., 1989; Aruffo, A. et al., 1990; Lesley, J. et al., 1990; Miyake, K. et al., 1990). Both RHAMM and CD44 have been shown to be associated with cell locomotion, cell proliferation and differentiation. Other HA-binding proteins in the extracellular milieu have also been identified and they are namely link protein, aggrecan, versican, GHAP, collagen type VI and TSG-6. </p>[0005] RHAMM was one of the first HA receptors to be isolated and characterized at the biochemical and molecular levels. It is an N-linked glycoprotein that binds HA with high affinity (Kd: 1 nM) and specificity. Several isoforms of RHAMM with different subcellular distribution have been identified. iRHAMM and pRHAMM are isoforms found intracellularly and on the plasma membrane, respectively, and sRHAMM is the form of a secreted protein. The molecular structure of the various RHAMM isoforms may be differentially regulated by phosphorylation and/or glycosylation status. The precise roles of the RHAMM isoforms have not been fully elucidated, but it is believed that pRHAMM and sRHAMM elicit opposite activities and the net functional behaviour of a HA-RHAMM interaction depends at least in part on the balance of pRHAMM versus sRHAMM expressed by the cells involved. </p>[0006] A full-length murine RHAMM cDNA has been cloned successfully from a GT11 3T3 cDNA expression library (Hardwick, C. et al., 1992). Immunoblot analyses of cell lysates using antibodies to peptides encoded in the cDNA reacted specifically reacted with RHAMM protein. Using a fragment of the clone DNA sequence, a mouse fibroblast genomic library was screened to clone the genomic RHAMM gene which spans at least 20 kb and comprises 14 exons ranging in size from 75 to 1099 bp (Entwistle, et al., 1995). </p>[0007] Similarly, a human RHAMM cDNA clone was also isolated successfully by a combination of screening a human breast cDNA expression library with the murine RHAMM cDNA as well as 5\u2032 RACE and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using messenger RNA from the human breast cell line MCF-1"
