    "ke, \n\n MI) at 37\u00b0C for ~ 16 hr. One ml of this starter culture was used to inoculate 100 ml Bagadi Medium that had been pre-equilibrated in the anaerobic chamber. This culture was grown to late log phase then centrifuged at 5,000 g to remove bacteria. The supernatant was precipitated with 50% saturated ammonium sulfate at 4\u00b0C for 1 hour, then centrifuged at 5,000 g. After discarding the supernatant, the pellet was solubilized in TN buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 M NaCl) and filter-sterilized. All subsequent chromatography was performed on an AKTA Purifier FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The filtered sample was loaded onto a mono Q 5/50 GL (Amersham) column equilibrated in TN buffer. The proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of ten column volumes formed from TN buffer and 100 mM Tris-HCl 7.5, 1 M NaCl. The fractions collected were assayed for doxorubicin releasing activity as described above. The two most active fractions from the mono Q column were pooled and loaded onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 (Amersham) column equilibrated in 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl. The column was isocratically eluted with the same buffer over 1.5 column volumes. The fractions were assayed for doxorubicin disrupting activity as described above. Proteins in the two most active fractions were separated by electrophoresis through an SDS- polyacrylamide gel and silver-stained using the SilverSNAP Stain Kit II (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The single dominant band (~ 45 kD) was excised for analysis by LC/MS/MS.</p>\n  [46] LC/MS/MS Peptide Analysis. The excised protein band was digested in-gel with trypsin, and analyzed as previously described (7). In brief, purified tryptic fragments were injected onto a 150 x 0.3 mm Vydac reverse phase column at 10 \u03bcL/min for 5 min in 5% buffer B using an Agilent 1100 Series Capillary-LC system. Buffers A (0.1% acetic acid) and B (99.9% acetonitrile and 0.1% acetic acid) were employed in the liquid chromatography (LC) step of the LC/MS/MS analysis. Peptides were eluted from the column with a 10-65% buffer B gradient over 90 minutes at a rate of 2 \u03bcL/min. Eluted peptides were detected by a LCQ DECA XP mass spectrometer (Thermo, MA), equipped with an electrospray ionization source, a low flow metal needle assembly operating in data dependent mode. The method consisted of two scan events, a full scan and a second data dependent MS/MS scan. The dynamic mass \n\n range of the full scan was set at 300 to 3000 ifa/z. The resulting MS/MS data dependent scan rejected known 'contaminant' masses of 371.0, 391.0, 445.0, 462.0, 1221.89, 1321.9, 1421.9, 1521.8, 1521.9, 1621.9, 1721.9 and 1821.9 m/z. Other method settings included a default charge state set to 4, dynamic exclusion with repeat count set to 2, repeat duration 1 min, an exclusion list size of 25 and exclusion duration 3 min. All other method parameters were default values set by the Xcaliber software v.1.2 (Thermo, MA).</p>\n  [47] Cloning of oligohistidine-fus"
