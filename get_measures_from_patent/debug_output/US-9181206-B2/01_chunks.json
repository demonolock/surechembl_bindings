Compounds of further interest include those having a pK<sub>i </sub>for binding to an AT<sub>1 </sub>receptor greater than or equal to about 7.5 and having a NEP enzyme pIC<sub>50 </sub>greater than or equal to about 7.0.</p>Since compounds of the invention possess AT<sub>1 </sub>receptor antagonist activity and NEP inhibition activity, such compounds are also useful as research tools. Accordingly, one aspect of the invention relates to a method of using a compound of the invention as a research tool, the method comprising conducting a biological assay using a compound of the invention. Compounds of the invention can also be used to evaluate new chemical compounds. Thus another aspect of the invention relates to a method of evaluating a test compound in a biological assay, comprising: (a) conducting a biological assay with a test compound to provide a first assay value; (b) conducting the biological assay with a compound of the invention to provide a second assay value; wherein step (a) is conducted either before, after or concurrently with step (b); and (c) comparing the first assay value from step (a) with the second assay value from step (b).

    "eptor or NEP enzyme plays a role. Any suitable biological system or sample having AT<sub>1 </sub>receptors and/or a NEP enzyme may be employed in such studies which may be conducted either in vitro or in vivo. Representative biological systems or samples suitable for such studies include, but are not limited to, cells, cellular extracts, plasma membranes, tissue samples, isolated organs, mammals (such as mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, dogs, pigs, humans, and so forth), and the like, with mammals being of particular interest. In one particular embodiment of the invention an AT<sub>1 </sub>receptor in a mammal is antagonized by administering an AT<sub>1</sub>-antagonizing amount of a compound of the invention. In another particular embodiment, NEP enzyme activity in a mammal is inhibited by administering a NEP-inhibiting amount of a compound of the invention. Compounds of the invention can also be used as research tools by conducting biological assays using such compounds.</p>When used as a research tool, a biological system or sample comprising an AT<sub>1 </sub>receptor and/or a NEP enzyme is typically contacted with an AT<sub>1 </sub>receptor-antagonizing or NEP enzyme-inhibiting amount of a compound of the invention. After the biological system or sample is exposed to the compound, the effects of antagonizing the AT<sub>1 </sub>receptor and/or inhibiting the NEP enzyme are determined using conventional procedures and equipment, such as by measuring receptor binding in a binding assay or measuring ligand-mediated changes in a functional assay. Exposure encompasses contacting cells or tissue with the compound, administering the compound to a mammal, for example by i.p., i.v. or s.c. administration, and so forth. This determining step can involve measuring a response (a quantitative analysis) or can involve making an observation (a qualitative analysis). Measuring a response involves, for example, determining the effects of the compound on the biological system or sample using conventional procedures and equipment, such as radioligand binding assays and measuring ligand-mediated changes in functional assays. The assay results can be used to determine the activity level as well as the amount of compound necessary to achieve the desired result, that is, an AT<sub>1 </sub>receptor-antagonizing and/or a NEP enzyme-inhibiting amount. Typically, the determining step will involve determining the AT<sub>1 </sub>receptor ligand-mediated effects and/or determining the effects of inhibiting the NEP enzyme.</p>Additionally, compounds of the invention can be used as research tools for evaluating other chemical compounds, and thus are also useful in screening assays to discover, for example, new compounds having AT<sub>1 </sub>receptor-antagonizing activity and/or NEP-inhibiting activity. In this manner, a compound of the invention is used as a standard in an assay to allow comparison of the results obtained with a test compound and with compounds of the invention to identify those test compounds that have about equal or superior activity, if any. For example, K<sub>i </sub>data (as determined, for example, by a binding assay) for a test compound or a group of test compounds is compared to the K<sub>i </sub>data for a compound of the invention to identify those test compounds that have the desired properties, for example, test compounds having a K<sub>i </sub>value about equal or superior to a compound of the invention, if any. This aspect of the invention includes, as separate embodiments, both the generation of comparison data (using the appropriate assays) and the analysis of test data to identify test compounds of interest. Thus, a test compound can be evaluated in a biological assay, by a method comprising the steps of: (a) conducting a biological assay with a test compound to provide a first assay value; (b) conducting the biological assay with a compound of the invention to provide a second assay value; wherein step (a) is conducted either before, after or concurrently with step (b); and (c) comparing the first assay value from step (a) with the second assay value from step (b). Exemplary biological assays include an AT<sub>1 </sub>receptor binding assay and a NEP enzyme inhibition assay.</p>Pharmaceutical Compositions and FormulationsCompounds of the invention are typically administered to a patient in the form of a pharmaceutical composition or formulation. Such pharmaceutical compositions may be administered to the patient by any acceptable route of administration including, but not limited to, oral, rectal, vaginal, nasal, inhaled, topical (including transdermal), ocular, and parenteral modes of administration. Further, the compounds of the invention may be administered, for example orally, in multiple doses per day (for example, two, three, or four times daily), in a single daily dose or a single weekly dose. It will be understood that any form of the compounds of the invention, (that is, free base, free acid, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, etc.) that is suitable for the particular mode of administration can be used in the pharmaceutical compositions discussed herein.</p>Accordingly, in one embodiment, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a compound of the invention. The compositions may contain other therapeutic and/or formulating agents if desired. When discussing compositions, the \u201ccompound of the invention\u201d may also be referred to herein as the \u201cactive agent,\u201d to distinguish it from other components of the formulation, such as the carrier. Thus, it is understood that the term \u201cactive agent\u201d includes compounds of formula I ",
