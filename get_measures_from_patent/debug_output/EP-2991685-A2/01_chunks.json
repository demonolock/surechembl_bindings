    "ved from the wells in the final row and discarded, resulting in a final volume of 100 \u03bc\u0390 in every well of the assay plate. Once sample dilutions are prepared in the assay plates, the plates are incubated at room temperature for at least 2 hours. </p> After the incubation, plates are washed three times with wash buffer. Detection antibody (Goat anti-mouse anti-IgG, HRP conjugated) is diluted 1: 1500 (0.33 \u03bcg/mL) in diluent and 100 \u03bc\u0390 of the diluted antibody is added to each well. Plates are incubated for 1 \n\n hour at room temperature and then washed three times with wash buffer, with each washing step including a soak time of at least 30 seconds. </p> After washing, detection substrate is added to the wells. Equal parts of substrate A and substrate B (BD Biosciences TMB Substrate Reagent Set, catalog #555214) are combined immediately before addition to the assay plates, and 100 \u03bc\u0390 of the mixed substrate solution are added to each well and incubated for 10 minutes in the dark. The reaction is stopped by adding 50 \u03bc\u0390 of stop solution (2N H2S04) to each well after the 10 minute period. The optical density (OD) of the wells is assessed immediately after adding the stop solution on a plate reader at 450 nm with subtraction at 570 nm. Data analysis is performed using Molecular Device's software SoftMax Pro v5.4. A four-parameter logistic curve-fit graph is prepared with the dilution on the x-axis (log scale) and the OD value on the y-axis (linear scale), and the half maximum value (EC50) for each sample is determined. The plate template at the top of the layout is adjusted to reflect the dilution of each sample (1 per column). Example 2: Polymeric Nanocarrier Containing Polymer-Rapamycin Conjugate </p>(Prophetic) </p> Preparation of PLGA-rapamycin conjugate: </p> PLGA polymer with acid end group (7525 DLG1A, acid number 0.46 mmol/g, Lakeshore Biomaterials; 5 g, 2.3 mmol, 1.0 eq) is dissolved in 30 mL of dichloromethane (DCM). N,N-Dicyclohexylcarbodimide (1.2 eq, 2.8 mmol, 0.57 g) is added followed by rapamycin (1.0 eq, 2.3 mmol, 2.1 g) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) (2.0 eq, 4.6 mmol, 0.56 g). The mixture is stirred at rt for 2 days. The mixture is then filtered to remove insoluble dicyclohexylurea. The filtrate is concentrated to ca. 10 mL in volume and added to 100 mL of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) to precipitate out the PLGA-rapamycin conjugate. The IPA layer is removed and the polymer is then washed with 50 mL of IPA and 50 mL of methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE). The polymer is then dried under vacuum at 35 C for 2 days to give PLGA-rapamycin as a white solid (ca. 6.5 g). </p> Nanocarrier containing PLGA-rapamycin is prepared according to the procedure described in Example 1 as follows: </p> Solutions for nanocarrier formation are prepared as follows: </p> Solution 1: PLGA-rapamycin @ 100 mg/mL in methylene chloride. The solution is prepared by dissolving PLGA-rapamycin in pure methylene chloride. Solution 2: PLA-PEG @ 100 mg/mL in methylene chloride. Th"
