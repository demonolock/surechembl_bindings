In some instances, the Fv framework region (FR) residues of a human immunoglobulin are replaced with the corresponding residues in an antibody from a non-human species that has the desired specificity, affinity-, and capability . The humanized antibody can be further modified by the substitution of additional residue either in the Fv framework region and/or within the replaced non-human residues to refine and optimize antibody specificity, affinity, and/or capability. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two or three, variable domains containing all or substantially all of the CDR regions that correspond to the non-human immunoglobulin whereas all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody can also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region or domain (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. </p>[0078] That an antibody \"selectively binds\" or \"specifically binds\" to an epitope or receptor means that the antibody reacts or associates more frequently, more rapidly, with greater duration, with greater affinity, or with some combination of the above to the epitope or receptor than with alternative substances, including unrelated proteins. \"Selectively binds\" or \"specifically binds\" means, for instance, that an antibody binds to a protein with a KD of about 0.1 mM or less, more usually about 1 pM or less. \"Selectively binds\" or \"specifically binds\" means at times that an antibody binds to a protein with a KD of about 0. 1 mM or less, at times about 1 pM or less, at times about 0. 1 pM or less, at times about 0.01 pM or less, and at times about 1 nM or less. It is understood that, in certain aspects, an antibody or binding moiety that \n\nspecifically binds to a first target may or may not specifically bind to a second target. As such, \"specific binding\" does not necessarily require (although it can include) exclusive binding, e.g., binding to a single target. </p>[0079] Polyclonal antibodies can be prepared by any known method. Polyclonal antibodies are raised by immunizing an animal (e.g., a rabbit, rat, mouse, donkey, goat, etc.) by multiple subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injections of the relevant antigen (a purified peptide fragment, full-length recombinant protein, fusion protein, etc.) optionally conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), serum albumin, etc. diluted in sterile saline and combined with an adjuvant (e.g., Complete or Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant) to form a stable emulsion. The polyclonal antibody is then recovered from blood, ascites and the like, of an animal so immunized. Collected blood is clotted, and the serum decanted, clarified by centrifugation, and assayed for antibody titer. The polyclonal antibodies can be purified from serum or ascites according to standard methods in the art including affinity chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, etc. </p>[0080] In an aspect, \"precision medicine\" methods and \"precision",
    "n of palbociclib and antiestrogens leads to decreased retinoblastoma (Rb) protein phosphorylation resulting in reduced E2F expression and signaling, and increased growth arrest compared to treatment with each drug alone. In vitro treatment of ER-positive breast cancer cell lines with the combination of palbociclib and antiestrogens led to increased cell senescence compared to each drug alone, which was sustained for up to 6 days following palbociclib removal and was greater if antiestrogen treatment was continued. In vivo studies using a patient-derived ER-positive breast cancer xenograft model demonstrated that the combination of palbociclib and letrozole increased the inhibition of Rb phosphorylation, downstream signaling, and tumor growth compared to each drug alone. </p>[0399] ICLUSIG (ponatinib) is a kinase inhibitor. The chemical name for ponatinib hydrochloride is 3-(imidazo[l,2-b]pyridazin-3-ylethynyl)-4-methyl-N-{4-[(4- methylpiperazin- 1 -y l)methyl] -3 -(trifluoromethy l)pheny 1 } benzamide hydrochloride.

Vemurafenib is a low molecular weight, orally available inhibitor of some mutated forms of BRAF serine-threonine kinase, including BRAF V600E. Vemurafenib also inhibits other kinases in vitro such as CRAF, ARAF, wildty pe BRAF, SRMS, ACK1, MAP4K5, and FGR at similar concentrations. Some mutations in the BRAF gene including V600E result in constitutively activated BRAF proteins, which can cause cell proliferation in the absence of growth factors that w ould normally be required for proliferation. Vemurafenib has anti -tumor effects in cellular and animal models of melanomas with mutated BRAF V600E. \n\n[0451] ZEVALIN (ibritumomab tiuxetan) is the immunoconjugate resulting from a stable thiourea covalent bond between the monoclonal antibody ibritumomab and the linker-chelator tiuxetan [N-[2-bis(carboxymethyl)amino]-3-(p-isothiocyanatophenyl)-propyl]-[N-[2- bis(carboxymethyl)amino]-2- (methyl)-ethyl] glycine. This linker-chelator provides a high affinity, conformationally restricted chelation site for Yttrium-90. The approximate molecular weight of ibritumomab tiuxetan is 148 kD. The antibody moiety of Zevalin is ibritumomab, a murine IgGl kappa monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 antigen. Ibritumomab tiuxetan binds specifically to the CD20 antigen (human B-lymphocyte-restricted differentiation antigen, Bp35). The apparent affinity' (KD) of ibritumomab tiuxetan for the CD20 antigen ranges between approximately 14 to 18 nM. The CD20 antigen is expressed on pre-B and mature B lymphocytes and on &gt; 90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). The CD20 antigen is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding. The chelate tiuxetan, which tightly binds Y-90, is covalently linked to ibritumomab. The beta emission from Y-90 induces cellular damage by the formation of free radicals in the target and neighboring cells. Ibritumomab tiuxetan binding was observed in vitro on lymphoid cells of the bone marrow, lymph node, thymus, red and white pulp of the spleen, and lymphoid follicles of the tonsil, as well as lymphoid nodules of other organs such as the large and small intestines.

    "that is distinct from that of other immunosuppressants. Sirolimus also inhibits antibody production. In cells, sirolimus binds to the immunophilin, FK Binding Protein- 12 (FKBP-12), to generate an immunosuppressive complex. The sirolimus:FKBP-12 complex has no effect on calcineurin activity. This complex binds to and inhibits the activation of the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR), a key regulatory- kinase. This inhibition suppresses cytokine-driven T- cell proliferation, inhibiting the progression from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle. </p>[0456] In an aspect, a disclosed method of treating cancer can comprise administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of ZOLINZA (vorinostat). ZOLINZA contains vorinostat, which is described chemically as A-hydroxy-A-phenyloctanediamide. The empirical formula is C14H20N2O3. The molecular weight is 264.32. Vorinostat is a yvhite to light orange poyvder. It is very slightly soluble in yvater, slightly soluble in ethanol, isopropanol and acetone, freely soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide and insoluble in methylene chloride. It has no chiral centers and is non-hygroscopic. The differential scanning calorimetry ranged from 161.7 (endotherm) to 163.9 \u00b0C. The pH of saturated water solutions of vorinostat drug substance was 6.6. The pKa of vorinostat was determined to be 9.2. Vorinostat inhibits the enzymatic activity of histone deacety lases HDAC1, HDAC2 and HDAC3 (Class I) and HDAC6 (Class II) at nanomolar concentrations (IC50 &lt; 86 nM). These enzymes catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from the lysine residues of proteins, including histones and transcription factors. In some cancer cells, there is an overexpression of HDACs, or an aberrant recruitment of HDACs to oncogenic transcription factors causing hypoacetylation of core nucleosomal histones. Hypoacetylation of histones is associated with a condensed chromatin structure and repression of gene transcription. Inhibition of HD AC activity allows for the accumulation of acetyl groups on the histone lysine residues resulting in an open chromatin structure and transcriptional \n\nactivation. In vitro, vorinostat causes the accumulation of acetylated histones and induces cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis of some transformed cells. The mechanism of the antineoplastic effect of vorinostat has not been fully characterized. </p>[0457] In an aspect, a disclosed method can be tissue agnostic and treat a cancer based on a genomic aberration, such as one, for example, set forth in Table 3, Table 10, Table, 11, Table 12, Table 13. and/or Table 14. </p>[0458] In an aspect of a disclosed method of treating cancer, \"and/or\" can be taken to be a disclosure of the two specified features or components with or without the other.
