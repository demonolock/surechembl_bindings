{"raw_mentions": "Unfortunately, there are no sentences that contain all four required components: a specific molecule name, a bioactivity metric (IC50, Ki, Kd, EC50), a specific numeric value for that metric, and a unit for that value. The text provides information on how to measure enzyme activity and calculate the IC50 value, but it does not provide specific IC50 values with units for particular molecules.\n\nHowever, I can suggest that you look at Table 3, which is mentioned at the end of the text. Although the table itself is not provided, it is likely to contain the results of the experiments, including the IC50 values for specific molecules. If you have access to the table, you may be able to find the information you are looking for."}
