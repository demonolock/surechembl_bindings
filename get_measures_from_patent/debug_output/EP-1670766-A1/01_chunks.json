    "enase-1 (MMP-1). This protein is obtained as an inactive pro-enzyme from Biocol, Potsdam (catalog no. MMP1). Activation of the Proenzyme: 2 volumes of proenzyme are incubated with 1 volume of APMA solution at 37 \u00b0 C for 1 hour. The APMA solution is prepared from a 10 mmol / L p-aminophenyl-mercuric acetate solution in 0.1 mmol / L NaOH by dilution with 3 volumes of Tris / HCl buffer pH7.5 (see below). The pH is adjusted by adding 1 mmol / L HCl between 7.0 and 7.5. After activation of the enzyme, it is diluted with the Tris / HCl buffer to a concentration of 2.5 \u03bcg / ml. To measure the enzyme activity, 10 .mu.L enzyme solution is incubated with 10 .mu.L of a 3% (v / v) buffered dimethyl sulphoxide solution (reaction 1) for 15 minutes. To measure the enzyme inhibitory activity, 10 \u03bcL of enzyme solution are incubated with 10 \u03bcL of a 3% (v / v) buffered dimethyl sulfoxide solution containing the enzyme inhibitor (Reaction 2). Both in reaction 1 and in reaction 2, after addition of 10 .mu.l of a 3% (v / v) aqueous dimethyl sulphoxide solution containing 0.3 mmol / L of the substrate, the enzyme reaction is monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy (328 nm (extinction)). / 393 nm (emission)). The enzyme activity is expressed as the increase in absorbance / minute. The inhibitory effect is calculated as percentage inhibition according to the following formula:% inhibition = 100 - [(extinction increase / minute in reaction 2) / (extinction increase / minute in reaction 1) \u00d7 100].
