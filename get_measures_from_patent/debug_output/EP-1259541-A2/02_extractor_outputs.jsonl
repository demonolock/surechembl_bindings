{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences:\n\nIt appears from this table that the avidity for heparin of the peptides SEQ ID NO: 33 (HBP8), 36 (HBP11)  and 37 (HBP12) is significantly lower (> 100x10 ^-9 M) than that of the other peptides which is on average between 20 and 80x10 ^-9 M.\nThe avidity of the different peptides with the chondroitin sulfates A, B, and C is on the whole of the same order of magnitude as that for heparin.\nThus the avidity of the peptides SEQ ID NO: 34 (HBP9) and SEQ ID NO: 38 (HBP13) both for heparin and for the 3 chondroitins is 46-50 x10 ^-9M, while that of peptides SEQ ID NO: 33 (HBP8), 36 (HBP11) and 37 (HBP12), both for heparin and for the 3 chondroitins, is > 100x10 ^-9 M."}
