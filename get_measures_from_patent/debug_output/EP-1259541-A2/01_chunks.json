    "/p>1) F.va 1 nari on of the ability of pppri e to react to DNA and with heparin,</p>The capacity of peptides SEQ ID NO: 1 to 21 to bind to DNA and heparin is evaluated on ELISA plates sensitized with DNA or heparin. Dilutions of the biotinylated peptides are deposited on the plates and their fixation is demonstrated using streptavidin conjugated to peroxidase. Peroxidase activity is revealed with orthodianisidine and H2O2 as the substrate. The avidity of each of the peptides for DNA or heparin is evaluated by the quantity (x 10 M) of peptides necessary to obtain 50% of fixation. The results obtained are reported in Table 4 below.</p>Table 4</p></p>It appears from this table that the affinity of SEQ ID NO: 1 for DNA is very low while that of its dimer (SEQ ID NO: 2) and its trimer  (SEQ ID NO: 3) is very large. It also appears that the association of SEQ ID NO: 1 with peptide vectors considerably increases the affinity of these vectors for DNA [compare SEQ ID NO: 4 and 5, 6 and 7, 8 and 9, and 15 and 16].</p>Similarly, the affinity of SEQ ID NO: 17 and SEQ ID NO: 18 for DNA, heparin and chondroitin sulfates is very low. On the other hand, the affinity for these dimer molecules of SEQ ID NO: 18 (SEQ ID NO: 19) is greater. SEQ ID NOs: 20 and 21 which contain a greater number of amino acids among which a high number of basic amino acids have a great affinity for DNA, heparin and chondroitin sulfates.</p>The avidity of the peptides SEQ ID NO: 25 to 39 for q various proteoglycans (Kd x 10-M) 1 <sup>\u039b</sup> heparin and the chondroitin sulfates is evaluated by the amount of peptides necessary to obtain 50% of fixation on the various antigens. The results are reported in Table 5 below.</p>Tabl pan 5.</p></p>It appears from this table that the avidity for heparin of the peptides SEQ ID NO: 33 (HBP8), 36 (HBP11)  and 37 (HBP12) is significantly lower (&gt; 100x10 <sup>~ 9</sup> M) than that of the other peptides which is on average between 20 and 80x10 <sup>\"</sup> M. The avidity of the different peptides with the chondroitin sulfates A, B, and C is on the whole of the same order of magnitude as that for heparin. Thus the avidity of the peptides SEQ ID NO: 34 (HBP9) and SEQ ID NO: 38 (HBP13) both for heparin and for the 3 chondroitins is 46-50 x10 -9M, while that of peptides SEQ ID NO: 33 (HBP8), 36 (HBP11) and 37 (HBP12), both for heparin and for the 3 chondroitins, is&gt; 100xl0 <sup>\"9</sup> M. The modified peptide SEQ ID NO: 28 (HBP3 + RGD) has lost its affinity for heparin.</p>2) Evaluation of the penetration of peptides in 1 R opllnles.</p>The cells are cultured in the presence of the various peptides carrying, on the N-terminal side, biotin at decreasing concentrations (50 to 6 \u03bcg / ml) in the culture medium for variable times (1-18 hours).</p>At the end of the culture, the cells are washed three times with PBS (0.15 M NaCl buffered with 0.01 M potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4) and then fixed for 15 minutes in ethanol at -20 \u00b0 C . The penetration of",
    "ents totally digested into small polypeptides. The removal of the Fc fragment makes it possible to reduce the size of the antibodies and simplifies the coupling with the peptides. The production of an anti-IgG peptide-F (ab ') 2 transporter will make it possible to internalize a large variety of mouse IgG in large quantities.</p>IgG anti-peroxidase is a monoclonal antibody of isotype IgGl which is isolated from ascites of mice. It is purified by affinity chromatography on protein G (GammaBind Plus Sepharose: Pharmacia). This antibody has a strong affinity for peroxidase, and by the same, for all molecules containing peroxidase. Peroxidase</p>(PO) is an enzyme extracted from black radish with a molecular weight of 44,000 Da, which can be associated very  easily to many molecules. The production of an anti-PO peptide-IgG transporter will make it possible to internalize PO and any substance containing PO in cells. Concanavalin, extracted from Canavalia ensiformis, is a lectin which has an affinity for the \u03b1-D-mannosyl and \u03b1-D-glucosyl end groups of proteins. This property allows it to react with many glycoproteins. The production of a peptide-concanavalin transporter will make it possible to internalize, in cells, numerous glycoproteins or glycolized molecules.</p>Streptavidin, a 60,000 Da molecule extracted from Streptomyces avidinii, and avidin, extracted from egg white, both have four recognition sites for biotin. Their affinity constant for this small molecule is very high (KD = 10 <sup>\"</sup> M) which allows them to interact with all substances containing biotin. The production of a peptide-streptavidin or peptide-avidin transporter will allow '' internalize biotin and any molecule containing biotin in cells.</p>The examples detailed below illustrate the production and use of such conveyors.</p>a) Evaluation dp The penetration of bovine rihonncl\u00e9asp A (RNasp &amp; _) transported by a transporter pept i de-F (ah '), anti-RNa.se in ls \u00e7pllnles. Gentle digestion of anti-RNase IgG with a proteolytic enzyme, pepsin, allows the F (ab ') 2 fragments to be obtained. This digestion, which takes place in a sodium acetate solution pH 4.5 with 2% pepsin, allows the fragmentation of the Fc fragment of the IgG without altering the active sites of the antibody.  Two mg of anti-RNase F (ab ') <sub>2</sub> antibody in 1 ml of 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 are added to 110 \u03bcg of SMCC [4- (N- maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylate succinimidyl] in 11 \u03bcl of dimethyl sulfoxide. The solution is incubated for 45 minutes at laboratory temperature. The excess reagents are removed by centrifugation on ultrafiltration membranes (cut-off threshold = 10,000 Da, Vivascience), followed by three washes in 10 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7 containing 0.5 M NaCl and 5 mM EDTA.</p>The coupling with the peptide is then carried out in a molar ratio of 6 peptides for 1 F (ab ') <sub>2</sub> in the 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, containing 0.5 M NaCl and 5 mM E"
