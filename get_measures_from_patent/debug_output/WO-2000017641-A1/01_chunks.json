Screening Assays</p>The invention provides methods (also referred to herein as a \"screening assays\") for identifying compounds which can be used for the modulation of body weight, e.g., for the treatment of a body weight disorder. The methods entail identifying candidate or test compounds or agents (e.g., peptides, peptidomimetics, small molecules or other drugs) which bind GPRIO and/or have a stimulatory or inhibitory effect on the activity or the expression of GPRIO and then determining which of the compounds that bind GPRIO or have a stimulatory or inhibitory effect on the activity or the expression of GPRIO have an effect on the feeding behavior, body weight, or metabolic rate of a mammal (e.g., a mouse or a rat) in an in vivo assay.</p>Candidate or test compounds or agents which bind GPRIO and/or have a stimulatory or inhibitory effect on the activity or the expression of GPRIO are identified in assays that employ either cells which express a form of GPRIO (cell-based assays) or isolated GPRIO (cell-free assays) . The various assays can employ a variety of forms of GPRIO (e.g., full-length GPRIO, a biologically active fragment of GPRIO, or a fusion protein which includes all or a portion of GPRIO) . Moreover, the GPRIO can be derived from any suitable mammalian species (e.g., human GPRIO, rat GPRIO (also referred to a UHR-1) , or murine GPRIO. The assay can be a binding assay entailing direct or indirect measurement of the binding of a test compound or known GPR10 ligand to GPR10. The assay can also be an activity assay entailing direct or indirect measurement of the activity of GPR10. The assay can also be an expression assay entailing direct or indirect measurement of the expression of GPR10 (e.g., GPR10 encoding mRNA or GPR10 protein) . The various screening \n\nassays are combined with an in vivo assay entailing measuring the effect of the test compound on the feeding behavior, body weight, or metabolic rate of a mammal (e.g. , a mouse or a rat) . In one embodiment, the invention provides assays for screening candidate or test compounds which bind to or modulate the activity of a membrane-bound (cell surface expressed) form of GPRIO. Such assays can employ full-length GPRIO, a biologically active fragment of GPRIO, or a fusion protein which includes all or a portion of GPRIO. As described in greater detail below, the test compound can be obtained by any suitable means, e.g., from conventional compound libraries. Determining the ability of the test compound to bind to a membrane- bound form of GPRIO can be accomplished, for example, by coupling the test compound with a radioisotope or enzymatic label such that binding of the test compound to the GPRIO -expressing cell can be measured by detecting the labeled compound in a complex. For example, the test compound can be labeled with <sup>125</sup>I, <sup>35</sup>S, <sup>14</sup>C, or ",

For example, the native signal sequence of murine GPRIO can be removed and replaced with a signal sequence from another protein. For example, the gp67 secretory sequence of the baculovirus envelope protein can be used as a heterologous signal sequence (Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Ausubel et al . , eds . , John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1992) . Other examples of eukaryotic heterologous signal sequences include the secretory sequences of melittin and human placental alkaline phosphatase (Stratagene; La Jolla, California) . In yet another example, useful prokaryotic heterologous signal sequences include the phoA secretory signal (Sambrook et al . , supra) and the protein A secretory signal (Pharmacia Biotech; Piscataway, New Jersey) .</p>In yet another embodiment, the fusion protein is an immunoglobulin fusion protein in which all or part of GPRIO is fused to sequences derived from a member of the immunoglobulin protein family. The immunoglobulin fusion proteins of the invention can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions and administered to a subject to inhibit an interaction between a ligand (soluble or membrane-bound) and a protein on the surface of a cell (receptor) , to thereby suppress signal transduction in vivo . The immunoglobulin fusion protein can be used to affect the bioavailability of a cognate ligand of GPR10. Inhibition of ligand/receptor interaction may be useful therapeutically for modulating feeding behavior, body \n\nweight, and/or metabolic rate. Moreover, the immunoglobulin fusion proteins of the invention can be used as immunogen to produce antibodies directed against GPRIO in a subject, to purify ligands and in screening assays to identify molecules which inhibit the interaction of receptors with ligands.</p>Chimeric and fusion protein of the invention can be produced by standard recombinant DNA techniques . In another embodiment, the fusion gene can be synthesized by conventional techniques including automated DNA synthesizers. Alternatively, PCR amplification of gene fragments can be carried out using anchor primers which give rise to complementary overhangs between two consecutive gene fragments which can subsequently be annealed and reamplified to generate a chimeric gene sequence (see, e . g. , Ausubel et al . , supra) . Moreover, many expression vectors are commercially available that already encode a fusion moiety (e.g., a GST polypeptide) . A nucleic acid encoding GPRIO can be cloned into such an expression vector such that the fusion moiety is linked in-frame to the polypeptide of the invention.</p>The present invention also pertains to variants of GPRIO. Such variants have an altered amino acid sequence which can function as either agonists (mimetics) or as antagonists. Variants can be generated by mutagenesis, e.g., discrete point mutation or truncation. An agonis",

At an appropriate time after immunization, e.g., when the specific antibody titers are highest, antibody-producing cells can be obtained from the subject and used to prepare monoclonal antibodies by standard techniques, such as the hybridoma technique originally described by Kohler and Milstein (1975) Nature 256:495-497, the human B cell hybridoma technique (Kozbor et al . (1983) Immunol . Today 4:72) , the EBV-hybridoma technique (Cole et al . (1985), Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77-96) or trioma techniques. The technology for producing hybridomas is well known (see generally Current Protocols in Immunology (1994) Coligan et al . (eds.) John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, NY) . Hybridoma cells producing a monoclonal antibody of the invention are detected by screening the hybridoma culture supernatants for antibodies that bind the polypeptide of interest, e.g., using a standard ELISA assay. Alternative to preparing monoclonal antibody- secreting hybridomas, a monoclonal antibody directed against murine GPR10 can be identified and isolated by screening a recombinant combinatorial immunoglobulin library (e.g., an antibody phage display library) with \n\nthe polypeptide of interest. Kits for generating and screening phage display libraries are commercially available (e.g., the Pharmacia .Reco-21bi.na.nt Phage Antibody System, Catalog No. 27-9400-01; and the Stratagene Surf ZAP'\" Phage Display Ki t, Catalog No. 240612). Additionally, examples of methods and reagents particularly amenable for use in generating and screening antibody display library can be found in, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,223,409; PCT Publication No. WO 92/18619; PCT Publication No. WO 91/17271; PCT</p>Publication No. WO 92/20791; PCT Publication No. WO 92/15679; PCT Publication No. WO 93/01288; PCT Publication No. WO 92/01047; PCT Publication No. WO 92/09690; PCT Publication No. WO 90/02809; Fuchs et al .

Such chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies can be produced by recombinant DNA techniques known in the art, for example using methods described in PCT Publication No. WO 87/02671; European Patent Application 184,187; European Patent Application 171,496; European Patent Application 173,494; PCT Publication No. WO 86/01533; U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567; European Patent Application 125,023; Better et al .

    "diment, the agent stimulates one or more of the biological activities of GPRIO. Examples of such stimulatory agents include the active GPRIO polypeptides and a nucleic acid molecules encoding a portion of GPRIO. In another embodiment, the agent inhibits one or more of the biological activities of GPR10. Examples of such inhibitory agents include antisense nucleic acid molecules and antibodies. These modulatory methods can be performed in vi tro (e.g., by culturing the cell with the agent) or, alternatively, in vivo (e.g, by administering the agent to a subject) . As \n\nsuch, the present invention provides methods of treating an individual afflicted with a disease or disorder characterized by unwanted expression or activity of GPRIO or a protein in the GPRIO signaling pathway. In one embodiment, the method involves administering an agent (e.g., an agent identified by a screening assay described herein), or combination of agents that modulates (e.g., upregulates or downregulates) expression or activity of GPRIO or a protein in the GPRIO signalling pathway. In another embodiment, the method involves administering a modulator of GPRIO as therapy to compensate for reduced or undesirably low expression or activity of GPRIO or a protein in the GPRIO signalling pathway.</p>Stimulation of activity or expression is desirable in situations in which activity or expression is abnormally low downregulated and/or in which increased activity is likely to have a beneficial effect. Conversely, inhibition of activity or expression is desirable in situations in which activity or expression is abnormally high or upregulated and/or in which decreased activity is likely to have a beneficial effect.</p>This invention is further illustrated by the following examples which should not be construed as limiting.
