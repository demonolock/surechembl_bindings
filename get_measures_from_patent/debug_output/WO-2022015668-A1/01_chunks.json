    "ons: the RBD stands up in the open conformation but lies down in the closed conformation (J. Shang et al., PNAS 117, 11727-11734 (2020); D. Wrapp et al., Science, 13;367(6483):1260-1263, (2020); and Z. Ke et al., Nature, 588(7838):498-502 (2020)). When the structures of the RBD/Nanosota-1C complex and the closed spike were superimposed, no clash was found between RBD-bound Nanosota-1C and the rest of the spike protein (Fig.18A). In contrast, severe clashes were identified between RBD-bound ACE2 and the rest of the spike protein in the closed conformation (Fig.18B). Additionally, neither RBD-bound Nanosota-1C nor RBD-bound ACE2 had clashes with the rest of the spike protein in the open conformation (Fig.18C, 18D). Thus, Nanosota-1C can access the spike protein in both its open and closed conformations, whereas ACE2 can only access the spike protein in its open conformation. Overall, our structural data reveal that Nanosota-1C is an ideal RBD-targeting drug candidate that not only blocks virus binding to its receptor, but also accesses its target in the spike protein in different conformations. To corroborate the structural data on the RBD/Nanosota-1 interactions, binding experiments were performed between the nanobodies and RBD using recombinant human ACE2 56 \n\n</p>as a comparison. First, the binding affinity between the nanobodies and RBD was measured using surface plasmon resonance (Table B; Figs.12A-12D). Nanosota-1A, -1B, and -1C bound to the RBD with increasing affinity (Kd - from 228 nM to 14 nM), confirming the success of affinity maturations. Nanosota-1C-Fc had the highest RBD-binding affinity (Kd = 15.7 picomolar), ~3,000 times stronger than the RBD-binding affinity of ACE2. Nanosota-1C bound to RBD ~3 times more tightly than ACE2 did. Moreover, compared with ACE2, Nanosota-1C- Fc bound to the RBD with a substantially higher kon and a lower koff, demonstrating significantly faster binding and slower dissociation. Second, the competitive binding among Nanosota-1C, ACE2, and RBD was investigated using protein pull-down assay (Fig.7A). ACE2 and Nanosota-1C were mixed in different ratios in solution, with the concentration of ACE2 remaining constant; RBD-Fc was added to pull down ACE2 and Nanosota-1C from solution. As the concentration of Nanosota-1C increased, less ACE2 was pulled down by the RBD. Thus, ACE2 and Nanosota-1C bound competitively to the RBD. The above protein pull-down assay was repeated with Nanosota-1C-Fc replacing Nanosota-1C (Fig.19). The result confirmed that Nanosota-1C-Fc and ACE2 bound competitively to the RBD; it further showed that Nanosota- 1C-Fc bound to the RBD much more strongly than ACE2 did, consistent with the binding affinity measurement. Third, competitive binding among Nanosota-1C, ACE2, and RBD was analyzed using gel filtration chromatography (Fig.7B). ACE2, Nanosota-1C, and RBD were mixed together, with both ACE2 and Nanosota-1C in molar excess over the RBD. The mixture was subjected to gel filtration chromatography. No ternary complex of ACE2, Nanosota-1C, and RBD had formed; instead, only binary complexes of ACE2/RBD and Nanosota-"
