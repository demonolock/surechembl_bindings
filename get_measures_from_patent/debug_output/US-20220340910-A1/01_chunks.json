    " is classified and diagnosed based on the decree of kidney function. CKD gradually progresses through interstitial fibrotic changes, leading to chronic renal failure, and then end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Conventionally, only dialysis has been a definitive treatment for ESRD. Although the possibility of slowing down progression to ESRD has been suggested by using an antihypertensive agent that act on the angiotensin system, therapeutic methods that target renal fibrogenesis itself have not been established. There is a desperate need for new CKD treatment. In terms of the progression process of pathological conditions, treatment targeting fibrotic changes is of the greatest significance as a common therapeutic strategy regardless of the type of primary disease. It has been reported that there are 500 million CKD patients worldwide. It is predicted that the number of patients will continue to increase in the future due to altered lifestyle habits. In addition, a large-scale trial revealed the very high risk of death from a cardiovascular disorder before receiving dialysis. Thus, considering CKD as a disease of the 21st century, active treatment of CKD is a significant challenge in the medical community (Sergio A et al., Hypertension 38: 635, 2001; Weiner D E et al., JASN 15: 1307, 2004; Anavekar N S et al., N Eng J Med 351: 1285, 2004; Remuzzi G et al., J Clin Invest 116: 288, 2006; Tonelli M et al., BMJ 332: 1426, 2006; Khwaj a A et al., Kidney International doi:10.1038/sj.ki.5002489).</p>In the next Examples, the inhibition of sugar chain-related genes that modify the sulfate group at position 4 or 6 was assessed for the effect on histological fibrotic changes in the renal interstitium.</p>Example 28Assessment of Anti-Fibrogenic Effect of C4ST-1 siRNA in a Mouse Diabetic Nephropathy ModelA type 2 diabetes model was prepared by the same method as described in</p>Example 21. Gestational Day 14 of C57BL/6JcL mice (CLEA Japan Inc.) were reared and allowed to deliver. Streptozotocin (STZ; Sigma) was administered to Day 2 postnatal C57BL/6JcL mice to prepare a STZ-induced diabetes model. The mice were subcutaneously injected with 20 \u03bcl of STZ (10 mg/ml) three times for two days. Thus, a total of 60 \u03bcl was administered to the mice. Together with their mothers, the mice were fed with a normal diet until they are four weeks old. After weanling at the age of four completed weeks, the mice were fed with a High Fat Diet (CLEA Japan Inc.) for two weeks. In the second week, 1 \u03bcg of chondroitin D-N-acetylgalactosamine-4-O-sulfotransferase 1 (C4ST-1) siRNA (GeneWorld) was combined with 0.1% atelocollagen (Koken Co.), which is a vehicle for siRNA, and 200 \u03bcl of the resulting mixture was administered into peritoneal cavities once a week (one shot/week) twice in total (for two weeks). On day 14 of this experiment, the mice were dissected and their kidneys were isolated to obtain samples for immunostaining. Gene expression, body weight, and effect on insulin resi"
