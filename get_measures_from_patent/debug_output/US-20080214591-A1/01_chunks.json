    "de for relevant receptor activation in amounts of at least about 30 percent, often at least about 50 percent, and frequently at least about 75 percent, of that maximally provided by (S)-(\u2212)-nicotine. Generally, typical compounds useful in carrying out the present invention are more potent than (S)-(\u2212)-nicotine in eliciting relevant receptor activation. Generally, typical compounds useful in carrying out the present invention effectively provide for the secretion of dopamine in amounts of at least about 50 percent, often at least about 75 percent, and frequently at least about 100 percent, of that maximally provided by (S)-(\u2212)-nicotine. Certain compounds of the present invention can provide secretion of dopamine in an amount which can exceed that maximally provided by (S)-(\u2212)-nicotine. Generally, typical compounds useful in carrying out the present invention are less potent than (S)-(\u2212)-nicotine in eliciting neurotransmitter secretion, such as dopamine secretion.</p>The compounds of the present invention, when employed in effective amounts in accordance with the method of the present invention, lack the ability to elicit activation of nicotinic receptors of human muscle to any significant degree. In that regard, the compounds of the present invention demonstrate poor ability to cause isotopic rubidium ion flux through nicotinic receptors in cell preparations expressing muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Thus, such compounds exhibit receptor activation constants or EC50 values (i.e., which provide a measure of the concentration of compound needed to activate half of the relevant receptor sites of the skeletal muscle of a patient) which are extremely high (i.e., greater than about 100 \u03bcM). Generally, typical preferred compounds useful in carrying the present invention activate isotopic rubidium ion flux by less than 10 percent, often by less than 5 percent, of that maximally provided by S(\u2212) nicotine.</p>The compounds of the present invention, when employed in effective amounts in accordance with the method of the present invention, are selective to certain relevant nicotinic receptors, but do not cause significant activation of receptors associated with undesirable side effects. By this is meant that a particular dose of compound resulting in prevention and/or treatment of a CNS disorder, is essentially ineffective in eliciting activation of certain ganglionic-type nicotinic receptors. This selectivity of the compounds of the present invention against those receptors responsible for cardiovascular side effects is demonstrated by a lack of the ability of those compounds to activate nicotinic function of adrenal chromaffin tissue. As such, such compounds have poor ability to cause isotopic rubidium ion flux through nicotinic receptors in cell preparations derived from the adrenal gland. Generally, typical preferred compounds useful in carrying out the present invention activate isotopic rubidium ion flux by less than 10 percent, often by "
