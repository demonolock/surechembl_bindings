The Hill coefficient is a measure of the slope of the dose-response curve; when the coefficient is in the region of 1.0, the interaction at the binding site is likely to be competitive.</p>It can therefore be seen from the above data that the composition of the invention has dual 5-HT uptake inhibitory and PDE4 inhibitory activity.</p>Accordingly, the Applicants have found that a composition that includes as an active ingredient an extract of a plant of the family Mesembryanthemaceae with mesembrenol and mesembrenone as the major alkaloids present, and whilst having low or trace amounts of mesembrine and selected amounts of mesembranol, shows remarkable serotonin uptake and PDE4 inhibition. This is particularly advantageous in that the composition lends itself to a wider use for medicinal purposes including in formulations for treating inflammatory conditions, and formulations for treating conditions with deficits in learning and memory. A further advantage of the above combination is the dual action of the composition which makes it suitable to treat conditions wherein the conditions of a patient are responsive to PDE4 inhibition, such as chronic inflammatory diseases where anxiety and depression are a commo"
