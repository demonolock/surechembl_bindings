    "radioimmunoassay (Dupont-NEN or Amersham assay kits). Cyclooxygenase activity is defined as the difference between PGE2 levels in samples incubated in the presence of arachidonic acid and ethanol vehicle.</p>\n  Assay of the activity of purified human COX-2</p>\n  The enzyme activity is measured using a chromogenic assay based on the oxidation of N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD) during the reduction of PGG2 to PGH2 by COX-2 (Copeland et al. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 91, 11202-11206).</p>\n  Recombinant human COX-2 is purified from Sf9 cells as previously described (Percival et al (1994) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 15, 111-118). The assay mixture (180 \u03bcL) contains 100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 2 mM genapol X-100, 1 \u03bcM hematin, 1 mg/ml gelatin , 80-100 \n\nunits of purified enzyme (One unit of enzyme is defined as the amount of enzyme required to produce an O.D. change of 0.00 l/min at 610 nm) and 4 \u03bcL of the test compound in DMSO. The mixture is pre-incubated at room temperature (22\u00b0C) for 15 minutes prior to initiation of the enzymatic reaction by the addition of 20 \u03bcL of a sonicated solution of 1 mM arachidonic acid (AA) and 1 mM TMPD in assay buffer (without enzyme or hematin). The enzymatic activity is measured by estimation of the initial velocity of TMPD oxidation over the first 36 sec of the reaction. A non-specific rate of oxidation is observed in the absence of enzyme (0.007 - 0.010 O.D. /min) and is subtracted before the calculation of the % inhibition. IC50 values are derived from 4- parameter least squares non-linear regression analysis of the log-dose vs % inhibition plot.</p>\n  HUMAN WHOLE BLOOD ASSAY</p>\n  Rationale</p>\n  Human whole blood provides a protein and cell-rich milieu appropriate for the study of biochemical efficacy of anti-inflammatory compounds such as selective COX-2 inhibitors. Studies have shown that normal human blood does not contain the COX-2 enzyme. This is consistent with the observation that COX-2 inhibitors have no effect on PGE2 production in normal blood. These inhibitors are active only after incubation of human whole blood with LPS, which induces COX- 2. This assay can be used to evaluate the inhibitory effect of selective COX-2 inhibitors on PGE2 production. As well, platelets in whole blood contain a large amount of the COX- 1 enzyme. Immediately following blood clotting, platelets are activated through a thrombin- mediated mechanism. This reaction results in the production of thromboxane B2 (TxB2) via activation of COX-1. Thus, the effect of test compounds on TxB2 levels following blood clotting can be examined and used as an index for COX-1 activity. Therefore, the degree of selectivity by the test compound can be determined by \n\nmeasuring the levels of PGE2 after LPS induction (COX-2) and TxB2 following blood clotting (COX-1) in the same assay.</p>\n  Method A.
