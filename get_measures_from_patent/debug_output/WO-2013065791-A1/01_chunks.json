    "r order structure such as a G quartet in the protruding portion.\n</p>[Example 2]  (RNA sense strand with 5 'overhang)  (1) High gene expression inhibitory activity when an RNA sense strand having a 5 \u2032 protruding portion is used In Example 1, when a DNA sense strand having a 5 \u2032 protruding portion is used, the gene expression suppressing activity by the RNA antisense strand is observed. It became clear that In Example 2, the activity when using an RNA sense strand having a 5 \u2032 overhang was evaluated.</p>FIG. 15 shows the results using miR-143 as the antisense strand. As an RNA sense strand, natural miR-143 <sup>*</sup> , complementary strand of miR-143 (Table 1-1, R143 (comp), SEQ ID NO: 45), RNA strand having a single base mismatch (Table 1-1, R143 (4m ), SEQ ID NO: 46), and RNA strand (Table 1-1, R143 (4m) 16L, SEQ ID NO: 47) having a 1-base mismatch and a 16-base long 5 \u2032 overhang. As a result, unexpectedly, when using an RNA sense strand (R143 (4m) 16L) having a 5 \u2032 overhang, a significantly higher gene expression inhibitory activity was detected compared to natural miRNA <sup>*</sup> (FIG. 15A). . Surprisingly, 100 pM showed about 7 times stronger gene expression suppression activity (FIG. 15A, comparing miR-143 <sup>*</sup> and R143 (4m) 16L).</p>Furthermore, when the gene expression inhibitory activity at a low concentration was measured, the RNA sense strand having a 5 \u2032 overhang has an inhibitory activity up to about 0.2 even at 50 pM. (FIG. 15B). When comparing the IC50, the natural type (miR143 <sup>*</sup> ) was 53.9 pM, whereas the protruding type (R143 (4m) 16L) showed 24.4 pM and more than double the activity (FIG. 15B).</p>(2) Examination of length of single-stranded overhanging portion Various RNA sense strands were prepared, and the activity was further evaluated.</p>\nFIG. 16 shows the results using miR-143 as the antisense strand. As the RNA sense strand, an RNA strand having a mismatch of 1 base and having a 5 \u2032 overhang of various base lengths was used (Table 1-1; R143 (4m), R143 (4m) 9L to 24L; sequence; Numbers 46-57). As a result, all RNA sense strands having 5 \u2032 overhangs of various lengths showed higher gene expression suppressing activity than those without overhangs (FIG. 16).\n</p>(3) Examination of change in gene expression inhibitory activity by assay system In the examples so far, the activity was evaluated according to the above-mentioned \"Method for measuring gene expression inhibitory activity\" unless otherwise specified. In order to confirm that similar results were obtained in different assay systems, GFP used for normalization was replaced with DsRed2 used for evaluation of gene expression suppression activity. That is, pDsRed2-C1 (Clontech) was used as a normalization plasmid, and pCAGGS-AFP-miR143 target was used as an activity evaluation plasmid (FIG. 17A). The pCAGGS-AFP-miR143 target was prepared by ligating a molecule obtained by annealing the DNA strands of SEQ ID NO: 4 and SEQ ID NO: 5 to a blunt end o"
