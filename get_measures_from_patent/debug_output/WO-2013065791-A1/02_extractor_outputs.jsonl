{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences:\n\nWhen comparing the IC50, the natural type (miR143 <sup>*</sup> ) was 53.9 pM, whereas the protruding type (R143 (4m) 16L) showed 24.4 pM and more than double the activity (FIG. 15B).\nSurprisingly, 100 pM showed about 7 times stronger gene expression suppression activity (FIG. 15A, comparing miR-143 <sup>*</sup> and R143 (4m) 16L).\nWhen the gene expression inhibitory activity at a low concentration was measured, the RNA sense strand having a 5 \u2032 overhang has an inhibitory activity up to about 0.2 even at 50 pM."}
