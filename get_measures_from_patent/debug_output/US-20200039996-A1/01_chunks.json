    "an be used to monitor both therapeutic treatment on symptomatic subject and prophylactic treatment on asymptomatic subject.</p>A treatment administered to a subject is considered to be effective if the level of expression of LSF or of LSF target genes in a biological sample obtained from the subject is decreased relative to a reference level of LSF by at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about 98%, about 99% or about 100%. In such embodiments, the reference level is the measurement of LSF or of LSF target genes at a previous time point from the same subject who has been administered to the treatment regimen. Based on the outcome of treatment, the dosage and frequency of administration using the methods and compositions as disclosed herein can be adjusted accordingly by one of skill in the art.</p>In one embodiment, the biological sample for analysis is a liver sample, wherein the sample comprises at least one cell. One can use any immunoassay to determine the level of LSF or of LSF target genes in a biological sample, such as ELISA or immunohistochemical methods of detecting LSF or LSF target genes which are commonly known in the art and are encompassed for use in the present invention.</p>In some embodiments, a method of determining the presence and/or level of LSF in a biological sample from a subject comprises performing a binding assay. Any reasonably specific binding partner can be used. For example, the binding partner is labeled. For example, the assay is an immunoassay, especially between LSF and an antibody that recognizes LSF, especially a labeled antibody. It can be an antibody raised against part or all of it, such as a monoclonal antibody or a polyclonal antiserum of high specificity for LSF. In some embodiments, the antibodies is specific to mammalian LSF, such as human LSF.</p>Thus, any anti-LSF antibody can be used in the method to determine the presence and/or level of LSF in a biological sample, which can be used to detect the increased or decreased level of LSF present in a diagnostic sample. Such antibodies can be raised by any of the methods well known in the immunodiagnostics field.</p>In some embodiments, an immunoassay is carried out by measuring the extent of the protein/antibody interaction of the LSF/antibody interaction. Any known method of immunoassay may be used. A sandwich assay or ELISA is preferred. In this method, a first antibody to the marker protein is bound to the solid phase such as a well of a plastics microtitre plate, and incubated with the sample and with a labeled second antibody specific to the protein to be assayed. Alternatively, an antibody capture assay could be used. In some embodiments, a biological test sample is allowed to bind to a solid phase, and the anti-LSF protein antibody is then added and allowed to bind. After washing away unbound material, the amount of antibody bound to the solid phase is determined using a labeled second antibody against the first.</p>In some embodiments, a label is preferably an enzyme. The substrate for the enzyme may be, for example, color-forming, fluorescent or chemiluminescent.</p>In some embodiments, a binding partner, e.g. an antibody or a ligand binding to LSF in the binding assay is preferably a labeled specific binding partner, but not necessarily an antibody. The binding partner will usually be labeled itself, but alternatively it may be detected by a secondary reaction in which a signal is generated, e.g. from another labeled substance.</p>In some embodiments, one can use an amplified form of assay, whereby an enhanced \u201csignal\u201d is produced from a relatively low level of protein to be detected. One particular form of amplified immunoassay is enhanced chemiluminescent assay. Conveniently, the antibody is labeled with horseradish peroxidase, which participates in a chemiluminescent reaction with luminol, a peroxide substrate and a compound which enhances the intensity and duration of the emitted light, typically 4-iodophenol or 4-hydroxycinnamic acid.</p>In another embodiment, an amplified immunoassay can be used which is immuno-PCR. In this technique, the antibody is covalently linked to a molecule of arbitrary DNA comprising PCR primers, whereby the DNA with the antibody attached to it is amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. See E. R. Hendrickson et al., Nucleic Acids Research 23: 522-529 (1995). The signal is read out as before.</p>Alternatively, in some embodiments, one method to determine the level of LSF in a biological sample is to use a two dimensional gel electrophoresis to yield a stained gel and the increased or decreased level of the protein detected by an increased an increased or decreased intensity of a protein-cont"
