TI mAbs strongly competed with one another and with D1 H1-3/H3-3, D1 H1-17/H3-14, or D2 H1-1/H3-1 for binding to H1 monomeric head domain, but did not compete with mAb 5J8, which binds the HA RBS. \n\n</p>DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS </p> Here, the inventors report a broadly protective, naturally occurring human antibody, designated FluA-20, which was isolated from a donor with an extensive previous influenza vaccination history. FluA-20 targets IAVs with exceptional breadth and affinity. The antibody recognizes the HA head domain from nearly all subtypes of influenza A viruses, with KD values extending to low nanomolar, even in their monomeric Fab form. The mAb protects mice from sub-lethal and lethal challenges of various pathogenic IAV strains for humans (H1N1, H5N1, H3N2, and H7N9). Structural studies of FluA-20 with the HA head domain revealed a novel epitope on the non-RBS side of the 220-loop and the adjacent 90- loop. Despite the variability of the nearby sequences, the key residues recognized by FluA-20 remain exceedingly conserved across diverse subtypes, enabling FluA-20 to exhibit very broad activity. Surprisingly, this epitope is largely buried in the peripheral interface of the native HA trimer. Although the antibody recognizes the head domain, it does not mediate conventional neutralizing activity in vitro, but rather it exhibits a new phenotype of activity comprising the capacity to disrupt HA trimers and inhibit cell-to-cell spread of virus. This finding suggest that the HA trimer interface (TI) can be exposed, perhaps transiently or partially. This work directs one to target these\u2018hidden\u2019 surfaces for development of broad anti-influenza treatments and vaccines. </p> These and other aspects of the disclosure are described in detail below. I. Influenza A Virus </p> Influenza A virus causes influenza in birds and some mammals and is the only species of influenza virus A genus of the Orthomyxoviridae family of viruses. Strains of all subtypes of influenza A virus have been isolated from wild birds, although disease is uncommon. Some isolates",
    " into single nodes, and edges were drawn between two nodes if their Hamming distance was the lowest compared to all other nodes. Nodes denoting the inferred common ancestor and the germline VH4-61/JH4 sequence were added manually. This network was visualized using Cytoscape and manually adjusted for visual clarity (to prevent nodes from overlapping edges to which they are not connected, and to shorten distances between nodes that are closely related). </p> Characterization of antibody isotype, subclass, and variable genes. The isotype and subclass of secreted antibodies were determined by ELISA. Antibody heavy and light chain variable region genes were sequenced from antigen-specific hybridoma lines that had been cloned biologically using flow cytometric single cell sorting. Briefly, total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, 74106) and reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT- PCR) amplification of the antibody gene cDNAs was performed using the PrimeScript One Step RT-PCR kit (Clontech, RR055A) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols with gene- specific primers as previously described (Thornburg et al., 2016). PCR products were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter) and sequenced directly using an ABI3700 automated DNA sequencer without cloning. The identities of gene segments and mutations from germlines were determined by alignment using ImMunoGeneTics database (Brochet et al., 2008; Giudicelli and Lefranc, 2011). </p> Determination of half maximal effective concentration (EC50) for binding. To determine EC50 concentrations for binding, the inventors performed ELISA using 384-well plates that were coated overnight at 2 \u00b5g/mL with the recombinant HA protein of interest. The plates then were blocked with 50 \u00b5L of 5% non-fat dry milk, 2% goat serum and 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS for 1 h at RT. The plates were washed and three-fold dilutions of the mAb starting from 10 \u00b5g/mL were added to the wells and incubated for an hour. The plates were washed and 25 \u00b5L of 1:4,000 dilution of anti-human IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Meridian Life Science, W99008A) was added. After a final wash, 25 \u00b5L of phosphatase substrate solution (1 mg/mL p-nitrophenol phosphate in 1 M Tris aminomethane) was added to the plates, incubated for 20 minutes and the optical density values were measured at 405 nm wavelength on a BioTek plate reader. The plates were washed 3 times between each step \n\n with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20. Each dilution was performed in quadruplicate, and the EC<sub>50</sub> values were calculated in Prism software (GraphPad) using non-linear regression analysis. The experiment was conducted twice independently. </p> Prophylaxis studies with sub-lethal challenge and therapeutic studies with lethal challenge in mice. Female BALB/c mice aged 6\u20138 weeks were obtained from Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, and housed under specified pathogen-free conditions with food and water ad libitum. For the prophylaxis studies, experimental groups of 8 mice were given i.p. with 10 mg/kg o",
    "parately and co- transfected into 293F cells. The cells were cultured for 6-7 days at 37 \u00baC, while shaking at 125 r.p.m. Secreted Fabs were purified Ni-NTA Superflow (Qiagen), monoS chromatography (GE Healthcare). </p> To generate IgG for a given antibody, the DNA fragment of the V<sub>H</sub> domain was fused with the DNA fragment of heavy chain Fc domain of human IgG1 via PCR. The full-length gene was cloned into the phCMV3 vector with the N-terminal IgK secretion signal peptide. \n\n IgG was expressed in 293F cells, as above, and purified by Protein G and monoS chromatography (GE Healthcare) and gel filtration. </p> Preparation of HA head domains. In brief, DNA fragments for the head domains (residues 52-263 of H1 HA (A/Solomon Islands/3/2006) and residue 43-306 of H3 HA (A/Hong Kong/1/1968)) were amplified separately with PCR reaction. The head domain DNA fragments were individually cloned into the pFastBac vector with an N-terminal gp67 secretion signal peptide and a C-terminal His6 tag. Recombinant bacmid DNA was generated via the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen) and baculoviruses were generated by transfecting purified bacmid DNA in to Sf9 cells. HA head domains were expressed by infecting the High Five cells with the recombinant virus, shaking at 110 r.p.m. for 72 h at 28 \u00baC. The secreted head domain protein was purified from the supernatant via Ni-NTA Superflow (Qiagen) and gel filtration on a Superdex75 column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl. </p> KD determination by bio-layer interferometry. An Octet RED instrument (Fort\u00e9Bio, Inc.) was used to determine KD of the antibody-antigen interactions by bio-layer interferometry. The association and dissociation curves were processed using the Prism GraphPad. To examine the binding of FluA-20 or the UCA Fab to different HAs, biotinylated HA molecules were diluted to 10-50 mg/mL in PBS pH 7.4, 0.01% BSA and 0.002% Tween 20. HAs were immobilized onto streptavidin-coated biosensors (Fort\u00e9Bio, Inc.) and incubated with FluA-20 or the UCA Fabs at highest concentration of 1 mM and with 2-fold dilution. The signals for each binding events were measured in real-time and K<sub>d</sub> values determined by fitting to a 1:1 binding model. </p> Structure determination of FluA-20 Fab and complexes of FluA-20 with HA head domains. All complex samples were concentrated to 8-10 mg/mL for crystallization screening on a high-throughput robotic Rigaku CrystalMation system at TSRI using sitting- drop vapor diffusion. The conditions of crystals for x-ray data collection are as follows: Apo FluA-20 Fab (20 \u00b0C; 0.2 M tri-sodium citrate, 20% (w/v) PEG3350, cryo-protected by addition of 15% glycerol); FluA-20_H1 head domain (20 \u00b0C; 0.1 M phosphate-citrate, pH 4.2, 40% (v/v) PEG300; No additional cryo-protection); FluA-20_H3 head domain (4 \u00b0C; 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 0.2 M lithium sulfate, 40% (v/v) PEG400; no additional cryo-protection). X-ray diffraction data were collected at multiple beamlines (Tables S3-4). The diffraction data were processed with HKL2000 and the structure was determined by molecular repla",
    " NIH Vaccine Treatment and Evaluation Unit [DMID 13-0033; a phase II human clinical trial with monovalent inactivated influenza A/Shanghai/02/2013 H7N9]). </p> The inventors performed deep sequence analysis of antibody variable gene sequences in circulating PBMCs in the donor and discovered sequences that appeared clonally related to FluA-20 (i.e.,\u201csiblings\u201d), defining two sequences as clonally related if they shared use of the same VH and JH gene and differed by three or fewer amino acids in the HCDR3 region. They identified siblings to FluA-20 in blood samples from four time points: days 5, 6, 11 and 14 \n\n post-vaccination with TIV. They inferred that the majority of these siblings arose from one common ancestor, and clustered into three major groups (designated Cluster A, B and C) that differ by point mutations across the VH gene region (FIG. 1B). Network analysis of these sequences suggested that FluA-20 arose from cells present at day 6 that also were observed at day 14 (FIG.1B). </p> Binding profile of FluA-20 and sibling antibodies with various subtypes of influenza type A HA molecules. To investigate the breadth of the isolated mAb FluA-20, the inventors tested purified IgG for binding activity to HA from different IAV subtypes; all HA proteins used were recombinant trimers. FluA-20 exhibited extraordinary binding breadth and affinity to recombinant HAs belonging to group 1 (H1, H2, H5, H6, H8, H9, H11 and H12) and group 2 (H3, H4, H7, H10, H14 and H15) viruses, with EC50 values for binding ranging from 5 ng/mL to 142 ng/mL (FIG. 1C and FIG. S1A). Genes of the wild-type FluA-20 variable domain were synthesized and a recombinant form of FluA-20 IgG protein was expressed; hybridoma-generated antibody (designated FluA-20) was used for the assays unless the recombinant form is specified (designated as rFluA-20). As expected, rFluA-20 IgG showed a similar binding spectrum to the hybridoma-produced FluA-20 IgG protein (FIGS.1C and S1A). Additionally, the inventors recombinantly expressed FluA-20 as an Fab fragment and assessed its kinetics of binding to representative HA subtypes that are pathogenic for humans using a bio-layer interferometry assay (Table S1). Remarkably, even in this monovalent form, rFluA-20 Fab interacted with most HA molecules from H1, H2, H3, H5, and H7 subtypes with K<sub>D</sub> values less than 100 nM (with several less than 1 nM, Table S1). </p> The inventors also recombinantly expressed and tested several somatic variant (\u201csibling\u201d) antibodies related to FluA-20 from cluster A and cluster B (FIG. S1B). Three sibling antibodies, Sib 2, Sib 3, and Sib 45, appeared to have very similar activity and breadth as rFluA-20 (Table S2). Also, they found that two sibling antibodies, Sib 28 and Sib 48 in a phylogenetic cluster that was more mutated than FluA-20, lost binding to some H3, H5 and H14 HAs, and Sib 7 and Sib 33 completely lost activity to any HA tested, likely due to the introduction of additional somatic mutations (T",
    "icles to focus responses to the FluA20 epitope rather than or in addition to the RBS epitope. Such antigens could be used in a vaccine setting to elicit FluA20-like responses or in a diagnostic setting to detect the presence of FluA-20 like antibodies. </p> The model antigen is a small, monomeric protein presenting one copy of the epitope. The primary objective is to develop a vaccine that induces protective antibody responses against influenza viruses via the FluA-20 binding site on the hemagglutinin head domain. The proposed vaccine possesses three key design elements: (i) Minimized and stabilized HA head domains for immuno-focusing to the FluA-20 epitope; (ii) Glycan masking of the minimal head domains to dampen responses outside the epitope and to ensure minimal cross- reactivity to wild-type HA; (iii) Nanoparticles presenting the engineered head domains for increased immunogenicity. </p> Developing a stable mini-domain antigenically focused to the A20 epitope. In order to focus antibody responses to the A20 epitope as opposed to other antigenic regions of the head domain, the inventors started with the wild-type head domains from H1 and H3, which can be expressed as monomeric proteins without loss of structure or antigenic profile (Table E). The sequences for the WT H1 domain, termed eHead_H1Solomon, and the sequence for the WT H3 domain, termed eHead-H3HK68_v1, were taken from the structures provided by Ian Wilson\u2019s Lab. Both monomers bind to FluA20 with high affinity (KD&lt;10 nM) and to FluA20_UCA with moderate affinity (K<sub>D</sub>~500 nM). \n<img id=\"imgf000067_0001\" path=\"imgf000067_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/789032840/WO/20201119/A1/002020/23/24/26/imgf000067_0001.tif\"/>\n \n\n The inventors employed structure-guided, computational design methods to engineer HA1 domains (eHead_H1) that present the A20 epitope but limit the number of other epitopes exposed. They modeled glycans using ROSETTA at various positions distal to the A20 epitope with the goal to maximally cover the HA head surface area while not interfering with A20 binding. These eHead_H1 glycans could help eliminate most antigenic cross- reactivity to wild-type HA, which would facilitate diagnostic detection of A20-like responses and might also facilitate specific vaccine induction of A20-like responses. The inventors developed many variants that have different numbers of glycans and still maintain good antigenicity. For example, eHead_H1_g1.14 has 6 engineered glycans, eHead_H1_g2.8 has 11 glycans and eHead_H1_g2.10 has 13 glycans, they all maintain good FluA20 binding (FIG.8). These various glycans can be used in different combinations. Sequences for 22 such glycan variants are listed at the end of the file (eHead_H1_g1.0_mC to eHead_H1_g2.10_mC). </p> To optimize thermal and conformational stability, especially to counter the potential loss of stability due to the addition of glycans, the inventors used computational design to develop varia",
    "d using the CellRanger software (10X Genomics). cDNA encoding heavy and light chains of interest were synthesized and cloned into IgG1 and IgK/IgL expression vectors, respectively (Twist Bioscience). Heavy and light chain plasmids were transfected into 96-well ExpiCHO cultures for microscale expression. After 7 days, mAbs were purified using protein G sepharose resin (GE Life Sciences) and buffer-exchanged into D-PBS using Zeba 96-well desalting plates (Thermo-Fisher Scientific). </p> Generation of H5.28 and H5.31 hybridomas and purification of IgG. PBMCs were isolated from a donor who had received experimental H5N1 vaccines, as previously described (Thornburg et al., 2013). Briefly, human B cells in the PBMC suspension were immortalized by transformation with EBV in the presence of CpG10103, cyclosporin A, and a Chk2 inhibitor and plated in 384-well culture plates. On day 8, the supernatants from transformed B cells were used to screen for binding to recombinant H5 HA (A/Vietnam/1204/2005). The selected cloned cell lines secreting mAb H5.28 or H5.31 were grown initially in hybridoma growth medium (ClonaCell-HY medium E from STEMCELL Technologies,). Prior to antibody expression and purification, these cell lines were switched to serum-free medium (GIBCO Hybridoma-SFM, Invitrogen). IgG from the hybridoma cell line supernatants was purified by affinity chromatography using protein G columns (GE Life Sciences). Purified H5.28 and H5.31 IgG generated from hybridomas was used for EC50 binding measurements, competition-binding assays, and animal studies. </p> Identification of FluA-151 siblings and phylogenetic analysis. Using a database of curated antibody sequences from the FluA-151 donor, the inventors searched CDR amino acid sequences in sequences encoded by both of the inferred germline genes for FluA-151 (IGHV3-30 and IGHJ4 for the heavy chain; IGKV1-39 and IGKJ1 for the light chain). From this pool of sequences, they selected heavy and light chains with a CDR3 length between 19 and 13 amino acids for the heavy chain and 10 and 8 amino acids for the light chain. The \n\n inventors then ran blastp with these CDR3s, the CDR3s of FluA-151, and the seven FluA- 151-related sequences identified in the single-cell RNA sequencing to obtain values for percent coverage and percent identity. They averaged the percent coverage and percent identity values to score these sequences and designated sequences with scores &gt;85% against FluA-151 or any of the other seven plasmablast-derived sequences as FluA-151 siblings. For these siblings, the inventors extracted the full-length nucleotide sequences and aligned those sequences to the corresponding germline gene (IGHV3-30*18 or IGKV1-39*01) as well as FluA-151 and FluA-151 sibling sequences using Clustal Omega. They used the PHYLIP phylogenetic software package to generate a maximum-likelihood tree from the aligned sequences using the DNAML program, using the sequence of the germline IGHV or IGKV gene as an outgrou",
    ", dNTP solution (10 mM each) and 10X SMARTScribe Reverse Transcriptase (Clontech) was added to the primer-annealed total RNA reaction and incubated for 60 min at 42\u00b0C. The first-strand synthesis reaction was purified using the Ampure Size Select Magnetic Bead Kit at a ratio of 0.6X (Beckman Coulter). Following, a single PCR amplification reaction containing 5 \u00b5l first-strand cDNA, 2X Q5 High Fidelity Mastermix (NEB), dNTP (10 mM each), forward universal primer (10 \u00b5M) and reverse primer mix (0.2 \u00b5M each in heavy-chain mix, 0.2 \u00b5M each in light-chain mix) were subjected to thermal cycling with the following conditions: initial denaturation for 1 min 30 s followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 98\u00b0C for 10 s, annealing at 60\u00b0C for 20 s, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 40 s, followed by a final extension step at 72\u00b0C for 4 min. The first PCR reaction was purified using the Ampure Size Select Magnetic Bead Kit at a ratio of 0.6X (Beckman Coulter). Amplicon libraries were then prepared according to the Pacific Biosciences \n\n Multiplex SMRT Sequencing protocol and sequenced on a Pacific Biosciences Sequel platform (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA). Raw sequencing data was demultiplexed and circular consensus sequences (CCS) were determined using the Pacific Biosciences SMRT Analysis tool suite. The identities of gene segments and mutations from germlines were determined by alignment using ImMunoGeneTics database (Brochet et al., 2008; Giudicelli et al., 2011). </p> Determination of half maximal effective concentration (EC50) for binding. To determine EC<sub>50</sub> concentrations for binding, the inventors performed ELISAs using 384-well plates that were coated overnight at 2 \u00b5g/mL with the recombinant HA protein of interest. The plates then were blocked with 50 \u00b5L of 5% non-fat dry milk and 0.1% Tween-20 in D- PBS (ELISA buffer) for 1 hr at RT. The plates were washed and three-fold dilutions of the mAb in ELISA buffer at a starting concentration of 10 \u00b5g/mL were added to the wells and incubated for an hour. The plates were washed and 25 \u00b5L of ELISA buffer containing a 1:4,000 dilution of anti-human IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Meridian Life Science, W99008A) was added. After a final wash, 25 \u00b5L of phosphatase substrate solution (1 mg/mL p-nitrophenol phosphate in 1 M Tris aminomethane) was added to the plates, incubated for 1 hr and the optical density values were measured at 405 nm wavelength on a BioTek plate reader. The plates were washed 3 times between each step with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20. Each dilution was performed in quadruplicate, and the EC50 values were calculated in Prism software (GraphPad) using non-linear regression analysis. Each experiment was conducted twice independently. </p> In vivo protection study. To assess protective efficacy of mAbs, female 18-20 g BALB/c mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were inoculated by the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route with a 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg dose of individual mAbs. Human anti- dengue virus mAb DENV 2D22 served as a mock control treatment at dose 10 mg/kg. Oseltamivir phosphate (hereafter referred to as oseltamivir) (Roche, Palo Alto, CA) diluted in sterile PBS was inoculated i.p. at 30 mg/kg/day and served as a positive control. In ABSL-2 facilities, ketamine-xylazine anesthetized mice were inoculated by the intranasal (i.n.) route at 24 hours after the mAb treatment with 2,200 50% cell culture infectious doses (CCID<sub>50</sub>) mouse adapted influenza A/California/04/2009 (H1N1pdm) in 90 \u00b5L of sterile PBS. Oseltamivir treatments were given i.p. twice daily for 5 days, starting at 1 h post-infection. Mice were weighed and monitored daily for body weight change and signs of disease for 21 days, and those losing over 30% of initial body weight were humanely euthanized as per \n\n IACUC requirements. This study was conducted in the AAALAC-accredited laboratory animal research center of Utah State University in accordance with the approval of the institutional animal care and use committee of Utah State University. </p> Competition-binding assays.

    "tein specificity. These heterosubtypic antibodies included siblings of FluA-20. However, the inventors also identified other heterosubtypic mAbs that used the IGKV1-39 light chain characteristic of FluA-20, H5.28, and H5.31. Sequence alignment for one of these new mAbs, designated FluA-151, showed that 7 additional members of the clonal lineage for that antibody (which were designated Sibs 1-7) were also were present in the collection of over 4,000 plasmablast paired heavy-light \n\n chain sequences (indicated as Sibs in FIG. 17B). They searched for FluA-151-like sequences in the collection of all antibody repertoire sequences for that donor obtained over the four- year period 2014-18 and found 178 additional somatic variants of the heavy chain and 99 additional variants of the light chain (FIG. 17B). The inventors constructed lineages of the clonotype, showing all corresponding heavy and light chain sequences, indicating the year and day after vaccination for the sample from which the variant was obtained (FIG. 17B). The lineage was complex and diversified and appeared to evolve over time. They expressed FluA-151, its inferred UCA (FluA-151 UCA), and the Sib 1 variant (FluA-151_Sib1) and tested the heterosubtypic breadth of these related antibodies. The UCA had a relatively broad pattern of binding, recognizing HAs from Group 1 (H1, H2, H8, H12), and Group 2 (H3, H4, and H7) (FIG. 17C). The intermediate FluA-151 Sib1 acquired recognition of a 2019 H3N2 strain and improved the EC50 value of binding for most Group 2 strains. The fully mature FluA-151 mAb was even broader, acquiring binding capacity for H5 and H6. These data show that the founder clone of the lineage was influenza HA-reactive and had substantial heterosubtypic breadth, and somatic mutations that occurred during elaboration of the lineage further enhanced heterosubtypic breadth. </p> To understand if there were common structural determinants of the molecular recognition of the TI site by the H5.31, FluA-20, and S5V2-29 antibodies, the inventors overlaid the crystal structures of the three antigen-antibody complexes. The complexes were remarkably similar on a global basis (FIG. 18A). The critical contact residues for each of the three Fabs (each derived from independent subjects) were identical. The Fabs shared a critical contact in the HCDR3 loop with an acidic (D or E) residue at Chothia position 98 contacting the R229 residue on HA (FIG. 18B). The Fabs also shared three critical bonds on two residues made by the light chain, at HA residues 222 and 224 (FIG. 18C). The inventors aligned the antibody variable region sequences of FluA-20 (1), FluA-151, H5.28, H5.31 and the SVV2-29, S5V2-52, S1V2-37 and S1V2-58 antibodies (2) (FIG. 18D) and observed a canonical sequence pattern, with a motif comprising: 1) Use of the IGKV1-39 light chain gene, 2) conservation of germline-encoded Y49 and Q55 residues in the light chain, 3) introduction of an S53N somatic mutation in the light chain CDR2, "
