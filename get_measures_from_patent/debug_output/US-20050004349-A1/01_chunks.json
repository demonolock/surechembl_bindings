Western blots of cell lysates prepared from prostate cancer xenografts and cell lines were probed with a polyclonal anti-STEAP-1 antibody preparation. The samples contain 20 \u03bcg of protein and were normalized with anti-Grb-2 probing of the western blots. </p>FIG. 7A-B. Cell surface biotinylation of STEAP-1. FIG. 7A: Cell surface biotinylation of 293T cells transfected with vector alone or with vector containing cDNA encoding 6His-tagged STEAP-1. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies, transferred to a membrane and probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. Lanes 1-4 and 6 correspond to immunoprecipitates from lysates prepared from STEAP-1 expressing 293T cells. Lanes 5 and 7 are immunoprecipitates from vector transfected cells. The immunoprecipitations were performed using the following antibodies: (1) sheep non-immune, (2) anti-Large T antigen, (3) anti-CD71 (transferrin receptor), (4) anti-His, (5) anti-His, (6) anti-STEAP-1, (7) anti-STEAP-1. FIG. 7B: Prostate cancer (LNCaP, PC-3, DU145), bladder cancer (UM-UC-3, TCCSUP) and colon cancer (LOVO, COLO) cell lines were either biotinylated (+) or not (\u2212) prior to lysis. Western blots of streptavidin-gel purified proteins were probed with anti-STEAP-1 antibodies. Molecular weight markers are indicated in kilodaltons (kD). </p>FIG. 8.

These results, combined with the absence of strong expression in the corresponding normal tissues (FIG. 3), indicate that STEAP-1 may be generally up-regulated in these types (as well as other types) of human cancers. </p>Example 3C Western Blot Analysis of STEAP-1 Protein Expression in Prostate and Other Cancers  A 15 mer peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 14 through 28 of the STEAP-1 amino acid sequence as shown in FIG. 1A-B (WKMKPRRNLEEDDYL; SEQ ID NO: 22) was synthesized and used to immunize sheep for the generation of sheep polyclonal antibodies towards the amino-terminus of the protein (anti-STEAP-1) as follows. The peptide was conjugated to KLH keyhole limpet hemocyanin). The sheep was initially immunized with 400 \u03bcg of peptide in complete Freund's adjuvant. The animal was subsequently boosted every two weeks with 200 \u03bcg of peptide in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Anti-STEAP antibody was affinity-purified from sheep serum using STEAP peptide coupled to affigel 10 (Bio Rad). Purified antibody is stored in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% sodium azide. </p> To test antibody specificity, the cDNA of STEAP-1 was cloned into a retroviral expression vector (pSRatkneo, Muller et al., 1991, MCB 11:1785). NIH 3T3 cells were infected with retroviruses encoding STEAP-1 and were selected in G418 for 2 weeks. Western blot analysis of protein extracts of infected and uninfected NIH 3T3 cells showed expression of a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 36 kD only in the infected cells (FIG. 6, lanes marked \u201c3T3 STEAP\u201d AND \u201c3T3\u201d). </p> The anti-STEAP-1 polyclonal antibody was used to probe western blots of cell lysates prepared from a variety of prostate cancer xenograft tissues, prostate cancer cell lines and other non-prostate cancer cell lines. Protein samples (20 \u03bcg each) were quantitatively normalized by probing the blots with an anti-Grb-2 antibody. </p> The results are shown in FIG. 6. STEAP-1 protein was detected in all of the LAPC prostate cancer xenografts, all of the prostate cancer cell lines, a primary prostate cancer specimen and its matched normal prostate control. Highest STEAP-1 protein expression was detected in the LAPC-9 xenograft and in LINCaP cells, in agreement with the northern blot analysis described immediately above. High level expression was also observed in the bladder carcinoma cell line UM-UC-3. Expression in other cancer cell lines was also detectable (FIG. 6). </p>Example 3D Immunohistochemical Analysis of STEAP-1 Protein Expression in Prostate Tumor Biopsy and Surgical Specimens  To determine the extent of STEAP-1 protein expression in clinical materials, tissue sections were prepared from a variety of prostate cancer biopsies and surgical samples for immunohistochemical analysis. Tissues were fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned according to standard protocol. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of LNCaP cells were used as a positive control. Sections were stained "
