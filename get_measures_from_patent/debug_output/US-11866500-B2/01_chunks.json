    "es the use of a PD-1 antibody in combination with pazopanib. However, the action mechanism of these VEGFR inhibitors, including sorafenib, sunitinib, axitinib and pazopanib, differ from that of apatinib. Apatinib has the strongest inhibitory effect on VEGFR-2, but it has little or no inhibition on other kinases, that is, apatinib is highly selective for VEGFR-2. Therefore, the disease treated by apatinib is also different from the aforementioned drugs, and whether apatinib can synergize with a PD-1 antibody and improve its efficacy need to be further studied. In addition, according to a current clinical study of a PD-1 antibody administered alone (Phase I study of the anti-PD-1 antibody SHR-1210 in patients with advanced solid tumors. (2017): e15572-e15572), the incidence of capillary hemangioma was as high as 79.3%, the incidence of hypothyroidism was 29.3%, the incidence of pruritus was 19.0%, and the incidence of diarrhea was 10.3%. Such high incidence of adverse effects undoubtedly put a burden on the mental health and quality of life of cancer patients; therefore, it is very important to reduce adverse effects during drug administration.</p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention provides use of a combination of an anti-PD-1 antibody and a VEGFR inhibitor in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of cancer.</p>Preferably, the VEGFR inhibitor is a VEGFR-2 inhibitor.</p>A preferred VEGFR inhibitor of the present invention is a VEGFR inhibitor which has an IC50 of less than 100 nM for VEGFR kinase and has no inhibitory activity against EGFR, HER2, FGFR (IC50&gt;10000 nM), according to the test method disclosed in CN101676267A.
