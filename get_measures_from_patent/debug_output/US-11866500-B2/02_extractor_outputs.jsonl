{"raw_mentions": "A preferred VEGFR inhibitor of the present invention is a VEGFR inhibitor which has an IC50 of less than 100 nM for VEGFR kinase and has no inhibitory activity against EGFR, HER2, FGFR (IC50>10000 nM), according to the test method disclosed in CN101676267A.\nA particularly preferred VEGFR inhibitor is a VEGFR-2 inhibitor having an IC50 of less than 50 nM for VEGFR-2 kinase, preferably less than 20 nM, more preferably less than 10 nM, and most preferably less than 5 nM, and the inhibitory effect thereof on VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-3 is poor, for example, its IC50 is greater than 20 nM, preferably greater than 50 nM."}
