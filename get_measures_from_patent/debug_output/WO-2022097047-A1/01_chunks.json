    "rising a complementarity determining region 1 (LCDR1) amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4, an LCDR2 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5, and an LCDR3 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6. </p>[0089] In some aspects, the anti-BCMA antibody or antigen-biding fragment thereof comprises a heavy chain variable region (VH) comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 7 and/or a light chain variable region (VL) comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 8. \n\n[0090] In some aspects, the anti-BCMA antibody or antigen-biding fragment thereof comprises a full-length heavy chain (HC) comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 9 and/or a full-length light chain (LC) comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 10. </p>[0091] In some aspects, the anti-BCMA antibody or antigen-biding fragment thereof comprises a full-length antibody. </p>[0092] In some aspects, the anti-BCMA antibody or antigen-biding fragment thereof comprises an antigen binding fragment. In some aspects, the antigen binding fragment comprises a single chain Fv (scFv). </p>A. Affinity of the anti-BCMA antibody or antigen-biding fragment </p>[0093] In some aspects of the methods of treating Multiple Myeloma (MM) in a subject disclosed herein, the antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, directed against BCMA may comprise any suitable binding affinity to BCMA or an epitope thereof. The term \u201caffinity\u201d refers to the equilibrium constant for the reversible binding of two agents and is expressed as the dissociation constant (KD). The affinity of an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof for an antigen or epitope of interest can be measured using any method known in the art. Such methods include, for example, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), surface plasmon resonance (e.g., Biacore\u2122, ProteOn\u2122), biolayer interferometry (BLI, e.g. Octet), kinetics exclusion assay (e.g. KinExA\u2122), separable beads (e.g., magnetic beads), antigen panning, and/or ELISA (see, e.g., Janeway et al. (eds.), Immunobiology, 5th ed., Garland Publishing, New York, N.Y., 2001). It is known in the art that the binding affinity of a particular antibody will vary depending on the method that is used to analyze the binding affinity. </p>[0094] A soluble form of BCMA (sBCMA) has been detected in the serum of multiple myeloma patients, with reported values ranging from 3.8 to 1062 ng/mL (Lee et al Br J Haematol 2016, Sanchez et al Br J Haematol 2012), and is comprised of the entire extracellular domain of the molecule (Laurent et. al. Nat Commun 2015). Therefore, sBCMA could diminish the effects of antibody-based therapies. The functional features of sBCMA and recombinant monomeric human BCMA are similar (Laurent et. al. Nat Commun 2015). Therefore, to mitigate the potential effects of sBCMA on the efficacy of a BCMA antibody-drug conjugate, it is desirable to select an antibody component that possesses weak binding to recombinant monomeric human BCMA and strong binding to membrane-bound BCMA. \n\n[0095] Affinity of a binding agent to a ligand, such as affinity of an antibody for an epitope, can be, for example, from about 1 picomolar (pM) to about 1 micromolar (pM) (e.g., from about 1 picomolar (pM) to about 1 nanomolar (nM), or from about 1 nM to about 1 micromolar (pM)). In some aspects, the monoclonal antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof may bind to BCMA with a KD less than or equal to 100 nanomolar (e.g., 100 nM, about 90 nM, about 80 nM, about 70 nM, about 60 nM, about 50 nM, about 40 nM, about 30 nM, about 20 nM, or about 10 nM, or a range defined by any two of the foregoing values). In another embodiment, the monoclonal antibody may bind to BCMA with a KD less than or equal to 10 nanomolar (e.g., about 9 nM, about 8.5 nM, about 8 nM, about 7.5 nM, about 7 nM, about 6.5 nM, about 6 nM, about 5.5 nM, about 5 nM, about 4.5 nM, about 4 nM, about 3.5 nM, about 3 nM, about 2.5 nM, about 2 nM, about 1.5 nM, about 1 nM, about 0.9 nM, about 0.8 nM, about 0.7 nM, about 0.6 nM, about 0.5 nM, about 0.4 nM, about 0.3 nM, about 0.2 nM, about 0.1 nM, about 0.05 nM, about 0.025 nM, about 0.01 nM, about 0.001 nM, or a range defined by any two of the foregoing values). In another embodiment, the monoclonal antibody may bind to BCMA with a KD less than or equal to 200 pM (e.g., about 190 pM, about 175 pM, about 150 pM, about 125 pM, about 110 pM, about 100 pM, about 90 pM, about 80 pM, about 75 pM, about 60 pM, about 50 pM, about 40 pM, about 30 pM, about 25 pM, about 20 pM, about 15 pM, about 10 pM, about 5 pM, about 1 pM, or a range defined by any two of the foregoing values). </p>[0096] In some aspects, the affinity of the anti-BCMA antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof to monomeric (soluble) BCMA, as measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR), is about 90 nM, about 80 nM, about 70 nM, about 60 nM, about 50 nM, about 40 nM, about 30 nM, or a range defined by any two of the foregoing values, for example, about 50 nM to about 70 nM, about 55 nM to about 65 nM, or about 58 nM to about 62 nM. </p>[0097] In some aspects of the methods of treating Multiple Myeloma (MM) in a subject disclosed herein, the ADC comprises an anti-BCMA antibody or antigen-biding fragment thereof that binds strongly to membrane-bound BCMA. </p>[0098] In some aspects, the ADC comprises an anti-BCMA antibody or antigen-biding fragment thereof that binds to monomeric (soluble) BCMA with a binding affinity of about 60 nM, as measured by SPR. In some aspects, the anti-BCMA antibody or antigen-biding \n\n fragment thereof binds to monomeric (soluble) BCMA with a binding affinity of 60.7 nM, as measured by SPR. </p>[0099] In some aspects of the methods of treating Multiple Myeloma (MM) in a subject disclosed herein, the affinity of the an"
