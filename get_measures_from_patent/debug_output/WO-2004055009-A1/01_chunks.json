    "AstraZeneca, Lund), was added at a final concentration of 1 \u03bcM in an assay buffer containing 1 mU recombinant human GSK3\u03b2 (Dundee University, UK), 12 mM morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS), pH 7.0, 0.3 mM EDTA, 0.01% \u03b2- mercaptorethanol, 0.004 % Brij 35 (a natural detergent), 0.5 % glycerol and 0.5 \u03bcg BSA/25 \u03bcl. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.04 \u03bcCi [\u03b3-<sup>33</sup>P] ATP (Amersham, UK) and unlabelled ATP at a final concentration of 1 \u03bcM and assay volume of 25 \u03bcl. After incubation for 20 minutes at room temperature, each reaction was terminated by the addition of 25 \u03bcl stop solution containing 5 mM EDTA, 50 \u03bcM ATP, 0.1 % Triton X-100 and 0.25 mg streptavidin coated Scintillation Proximity Assay (SPA) beads (Amersham, \n\nUK). After 6 hours the radioactivity was determined in a liquid scintillation counter (1450 MicroBeta Trilux, Wallac). The inhibition curves were analysed by non-linear regression using GraphPad Prism, USA. The K<sub>m</sub> value of ATP for GSK3\u03b2, used to calculate the inhibition constants (K of the various compounds, was 20 \u03bcM.</p>\n  The following abbreviations have been used:</p>\n  MOPS Morpholinepropanesulfonic acid</p>\n  EDTA Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid</p>\n  BSA Bovin Serum Albumin ATP Adenosine Triphosphate</p>\n  SPA Scintillation Proximity Assay</p>\n  GSK3 Glycogen synthase kinase 3</p>\n  Results</p>\n  Typical Kj values for the compounds of the present invention are in the range of about 0.001 to about 10,000 nM.
