This property is due to an increase in anionic phospholipid on the surface of the platelet with concomitant release of microvesicle from the surface. This is an essential physiological reaction and people whose platelets have reduced ability to generate procoagulant activity (Scott syndrome) show an increased tendency for bleeding.</p>Method:Washed platelets were treated with either 115 nM thrombin, 23 \u03bcg/ml collagen or a mixture of both at the same concentration at 37\u00b0 C. TRI 50b was added either for 1 minute prior to the addition of activator or immediately after the incubation with activator. Platelet procoagulant activity was determined as described previously (Goodwin C A et al, Biochem J. 1995 8, 308: 15-21).</p>TRI 50b proved to be a potent Inhibitor of platelet procoagulant activity with IC<sub>50</sub>'s as summarised below:</p>Table 2: Influence of TRI 50b on the induction of platelet procoagulant activity by various agonists:</p>TABLE 2IC50 plus pre-IC50 withoutFold accelerationincubationincubationAgonistwithout TRI 50b(nM)(nM)Thrombin3083000Collagen45200300Thrombin/Collagen110380</p>Table 2 records, for example, that when platelets were treated with thrombin they caused a 30-fold acceleration of the rate of activation of prothrombin in comparison with control platelets. Treatment with TRI 50 reduced such acceleration by half at the various TRI 50 concentration levels given. The significant potency of TRI 50 is evidenced by the fact that the IC<sub>50 </sub>values are in the nanomolar range.</p>TRI 50b does not have an effect on ADP, collagen or epinephrine induced aggregation of washed platelets.</p>Example 37Rabbit Extracorporeal Shunt ModelIntroductionThe technique describes an animal model in which a platelet rich thrombus is produced. The activity of TRI 50b and heparin are compared.</p>The carotid artery and jugular vein of anaesthetised rabbits were used to create an extracorporeal circuit containing a suspended foreign surface (silk thread). Thrombus deposition Is initiated by creation of high sheer stress turbulent arterial blood flow, platelet activation, followed by coagulation in the presence of thrombogenic surfaces. Histopathological studies have shown that the thrombus is platelet rich.</p>Materials and MethodsAnimals:NZW rabbits (males 2.5-3.5 kg) were used. The animals were allowed food and water up to the induction of anaesthesia.</p>Anaesthesia:Animals were premedicated with fontanel/fluanisone (Hypnor",
