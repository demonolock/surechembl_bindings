    "ic regions of T\u03b2R-I into pGEX-4T-1 (Pharmacia) using their stable expression plasmids as templates with RIS1-sma or RISdel2-sma as sense primers and RIAS-not as an antisense primer. PCR conditions were 1 min at 94\u00b0 C., 1 min at 54\u00b0 C., and 1 min at 72\u00b0 C. for 25 cycles. The resulting PCR products for the GST fusion protein constructs were digested with SmaI and NotI, and ligated in-frame into pGEX-4T-1.</p>The structures of PCR-amplified region of the recombinants were all confirmed by sequencing using a Sequenase DNA sequencing kit (U.S. Biochemical). Cell Culture and Transfection--The Mv1Lu mink lung epithelial cells (CCL-64; American Type Culture Collection) and the R mutant Mv1Lu cells (clone 4-2; R4-2) (Laiho et al (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265:18518-18524) were maintained in DMEM (Nissui) supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 units/ml penicillin. To generate stable transfectants expressing the various mutant forms of T\u03b2R-I, R4-2 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method using Eukaryotic transfection kit (Promega). Selection of transfected cells was performed in the presence of 120 U/ml of hygromycin B (Wako Chemicals). Resistant cell colonies were examined for the expression of T\u03b2R-I and its mutants by the receptor affinity-labelling assays using <sup>125</sup> ITGF-\u03b21 after induction of the recombinant proteins by ZnCl<sub>2</sub>. More than two independent clones for each of the transfectants were subjected to the following experiments.</p>Receptor Binding Assay of T\u03b2R-1 Mutants--Recombinant human TGF-\u03b21 (Kirin Brewery Company) was iodinated using the chloramine T method as described in Frolik et al (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259:10995-1100. Affinity cross-linking experiments were performed with cells pretreated in DMEM containing 0.2% FBS with or without 100 \u03bcM ZnCl<sub>2</sub> for 6 h, followed by the binding of <sup>125</sup> I-TGF-\u03b21 in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 3 h at 4\u00b0 C. After washing the cells with PBS three times, the ligand-receptor complexes were cross-linked with 0.27 mM DSS (Pierce Chemical Co.). Cells were washed once with 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1 mM EDTA and 10% glycerol, and solubilized by incubation in TNE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40) containing 1.5% of aprotinin for 20 min at 4\u00b0 C. For immunoprecipitation of the cross-linked complexes, cell lysates were then incubated with an antiserum against T\u03b2R-II (Franzen et al (1993) Cell 75:681-692) for 60 min at 4\u00b0 C. Immune complexes were bound to protein A-Sepharose (Kabi Pharmacia) for 45 min at 4\u00b0 C., washed once with TNE buffer, and eluted by boiling in SDS-sample buffer (100 mM Tris, pH 8.8, 0.01% bromophenol blue, 36% glycerol, 4% SDS) in the presence of 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). The samples were analyzed by SDS-8.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Fuji BAS 2000 Bio-Imaging Analyzer (Fuji Photo Film).</p>Cell Proliferation Assay--Cells were plated into 24-well plates at 5\u00d710<sup>4</s"
