DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS </p> In one embodiment, the present disclosure relates to a method, comprising administering, to a mammal suffering from",
    "d into a GAL4-DBD-containing vector, pcDNA3.1B. </p> One-hybrid reporter assays. For mammalian one-hybrid assays, HEK293T cells were cotransfected with pcDNA3.1 B-G4DBD-RORa yLBD, pGL4.31 and TK promoter Renilla luciferase construct (tK.pRL). To investigate the regulation of the Bmall reporter, Hepal-6 cells were cotransfected with Bmall -WT or mutant RORE reporter plasmids, RORa, RORy or Rev-erba expression construct along with tK.pRL. Mouse and human siRNA targeting RORa and RORy were purchased from Santa Cruz. Transfection was performed by Lipfectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were treated with vehicle or NOB. Lysates were collected 24h after treatment, and firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured by using a Dual- Luciferase Reporter System (Promega). Regardless of the nature of the ligand (agonist or inverse agonist), ligand interaction with these chimeric receptors has been shown to reduce transcriptional activity of these chimeric receptors (Wang et al, 2010a; Wang et al., 2010b). </p> Radioligand receptor binding assays. Previously described protocols with minor modifications (Kumar et al, 2010; Wang et al, 2010b). For saturation binding experiments, lOOng RORa-LBD or 200ng RORy-LBD was incubated with 25-[3H]- \n\n hydroxycholesterol (OHC) in assay buffer [50mM HEPES, pH. 7.4, 0.05% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 150mM NaCl and 5mM MgC12]. Ligand binding was determined by filter binding assays to calculate the Kd value. For competitive binding assay, lOOng RORa-LBD or 200ng RORy-LBD was incubated with various concentrations of Nobiletin, Naringin or Naringenin in the presence of 4.5 nM 25-[3H]- OHC. Ki was determined using the Cheng-Prusoff equation. </p> RNA-mediated interference. Hepal-6 cells on the 24-well plate were transfected using control siRNA and siRNA against mouse RORa and RORy (Santa Cruz). Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were treated with DMSO or NOB (3 \u03bc\u039c). After 12hr treatment, cells were harvested and total RNA was insolated. Real-time qPCR was performed to analyze the mRNA expression of mouse Rora and Rorc with a MaxPro3000 Thermocycler (Agilent). </p> Statistical analysis. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical significance was determined by one-way or two-way ANOVA with Turkey's and Dunnett's tests for multiple group comparisons. PO.05 was considered to be statistically significant. </p> In all examples, data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical significance was determined by one-way or two-way ANOVA with Turkey or Dunnett tests for multiple- group comparisons. A p value &lt; 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. </p> A naturally occurring polymethoxylated flavonoid enriched in citrus peels, nobiletin, was found independently from two sub-libraries to enhance the reporter rhythm of the Clock<sup>A19/+</sup> cells (Fi gures 1A and IB). Tangeretin, a close analog of nobiletin, similarly enhanced the PER2::Luc reporter rhythm in Clock<sup>A19/+</sup> cells (Figures 2A and 2B). Nobiletin robustly enhanced the amplitude of PER2: :LucSV reporter rhythm (Chen et al, 2012) and also lengthened the period in a dose-dependent manner, with an estimated half maximal effective concentration of &lt;5.0 mM (Figure 1C). Similar to previously \n\n reported CEMs (Chen et al, 2012, 2013), nobiletin was ineffective in restoring the rhythm in clock-disrupted homozygous Clock<sup>A19/A19</sup> reporter cells (Figure ID). Importantly, nobiletin enhanced PER2::Luc reporter rhythms in peripheral tissue explants from both Clock<sup>419</sup>^ and WT reporter knockin mice (Figures IE and 2C), but not in the SCN, which is resistant to external perturbation due to robust inter-neuronal coupling (Figure 2D) (Buhr et al, 2010; Chen et al, 2012; Liu et al., 2007). In accordance with the resistance of the SCN to nobiletin manipulation, normal wheel-running activity and periodicity in WT C57BL/6J mice treated with nobiletin (Figure IF) was observed. </p> Nobiletin has shown a wide variety of beneficial effects (Ben- Aziz, 1967; Cui et al, 2010; Mulvihill et al, 2011 ; Nagase et al., 2005; Walle, 2007). However, its role as a modulator of the circadian clock was previously unknown. Whereas Per 2 transcript levels were moderately altered and reduced at CT20 by nobiletin in PER2::LucSV cells (Figure 2E), PER2 proteins were found to accumulate to greater levels (Figures 2F and 2G), consistent with the elevated bioluminescence and suggesting a post-transcriptional mechanism for PER2 enrichment. Expression of other core clock genes was also altered by nobiletin (Figures 2E-2G). In particular, CRY1, the heterodimeric partner of PERs in the negative arm of",
    "reverted back to baseline levels by nobiletin, consistent with the nobiletin efficacy in mitigating hepatic steatosis (Fig. 5G). Nobiletin also altered the expression of genes involved in gluconeogenesis and glycolysis (e.g., Pdk4 and Pkm2). </p> Example 5. Retinoid acid receptor-like Orphan Receptor (ROR) as Direct Protein Targets for nobiletin. </p> Cross-examination of previous circadian chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing studies (Cho et al, 2012; Koike et al., 2012) revealed that 63% of the nobiletin-responsive genes showed promoter occupancy of core clock proteins (Figure 11B), particularly REV-ERBs (protein encoded by the reverse DNA strand of c-erbA). REV-ERBs and RORs function respectively as negative and positive transcription factors \n\n competing for binding to RORE promoter elements, playing important roles in circadian rhythms, metabolism, and inflammation (Gerhart-Hines et al., 2013; Jetten et al., 2013; Kojetin and Burris, 2014). In a previous screen for inhibitors of RORyt, nobiletin was among a number of primary screen hits that instead activated RORyt and consequently were not validated further (Huh et al, 2011). ROR family receptors consist of \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 isoforms. RORa and RORy are more similar in tissue distribution and the ligand-binding domain structure, whereas RORP is more divergent (Kallen et al., 2002; Solt et al, 2010; Stehlin et al., 2001). </p> To characterize direct interaction between nobiletin and ROR proteins, a competitive radio-ligand binding assay for RORs using 25-[3H]-hydroxy cholesterol (25- [3H]-OHC) (Kumar et al, 2010; Wang et al, 2010b). Saturation curves and Scatchard plots validated the assay, with similar Kd values to that previously reported (Figs. 12A and 12B) (Kumar et al., 2010; Wang et al, 2010b) was used. Importantly, nobiletin showed robust competitive binding to the LBDs of RORa and RORy, with higher affinity for RORy (Fig. 12C; see Ki comparison). In contrast, naringin or its aglycone derivative Naringenin showed markedly diminished binding in the same concentration range (Figs. 12C and 12D). Consistent with these binding assay results, nobiletin showed robust activities as did the known ROR ligand SR1001 (Solt et al, 2011) for GAL4-RORa and GAL4-RORy chimeric receptors in mammalian one-hybrid reporter assays, and naringin showed no activities (Figs. 12E and 12F). Of note, regardless of the nature of the ligand (agonist or inverse agonist), ligand interaction with these chimeric receptors has been shown to reduce transcriptional activity of these chimeric receptors (Wang et al, 2010a, 2010b). These results together indicate direct binding of nobiletin to RORa and RORy. </p> Functional assays were used to characterize the effect of nobiletin on RORa/\u03b3 transcriptional activity. Nobiletin was found to dose-dependently increase Bmall \n\n promoter-driven luciferase reporter activity with WT, but not mutant, RORE elements (Preitner et al, 2002) in the presence of RORa or RORy in Hepal-6 cells (Fig. 12G). Conversely, knockdown of the Rora/c genes encoding RORa/\u03b3 by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) abrogated the nobiletin- mediated induction of Bmall promoter-driven luciferase reporter activity in both Hepal-6 and U20S cells (Figs. 12H and 11C). Several ROR target genes (e.g., Cyp7bl, IkBa, and Gck) were induced in nobiletin-treated DIO mouse liver relative to control treatment (Fig. 121), and Ingenuity pathway analysis also showed an important role of RORs in the genome-wide nobiletin response (Figure 11D). Together, these results indicate that nobiletin directly binds to and activates RORs and"
