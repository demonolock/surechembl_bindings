    "two kinds of septivalency duplicate domains at least, is called HRA and HRB, and lays respectively at fusogenic peptide and stride near the film grappling territory.Be in and merge preceding conformation, the F2-F1 dipolymer forms ball head and stem structure, and wherein the HRA territory is in sectional (extension) conformation in ball head.Comparatively speaking, the HRB territory forms the three chain coiled coil stems that extend from head zone.During merging forward direction and merging the back conformation transition, HRA collapses in the territory (collapse), and make its near the HRB territory to form antiparallel six helical bundles.Be in and merge the back state, fusogenic peptide and membrane-spanning domain are side by side so that the film fusion.</p>Though the conformation that is above provided is described the molecule modeling based on crystallographic data, the structural difference that merges between preceding and the fusion back conformation can monitored in crystallographic situation.For example, before can using the electron photomicrograph art to distinguish to merge and merge the back (perhaps be called melt former before and melt former) conformation, as by Calder etc., Virology, 271:122-131 (2000) and Morton etc., Virology, what 311:275-288 demonstrated, for their technology instruction, they are taken in this paper by mentioning.Also can distinguish and merge preceding conformation and melt former (merging the back) conformation by the liposome binding assay, as by Connolly etc., Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.USA, 103:17903-17908 (2006) is described, for its technology instruction, also it is taken in this paper by mentioning.In addition, before can using following antibody (for example monoclonal antibody) to distinguish to merge with melt former conformation, before the proteic fusion of described antibodies specific identification RSV F or melt that one of former form is planted or another kind of going up exists, and another kind of formal non-existent conformational epitope.This type of conformational epitope can be because the preferential exposure of antigenic determinant on the molecular surface.Perhaps, conformational epitope can come from the linear polypeptide discontinuous amino acid whose arranged side by side.</p>Be designed to PreF antigen disclosed herein stable and keep the proteic fusion of RSV F before conformation, thereby in expressed proteinic colony, the expressed protein colony of substantial part be in melt former before (before merging) conformation (for example as predicted by structure and/or thermodynamics modeling or as assessing by one or more methods disclosed above).Stabilization is modified in the exemplary F albumen of introducing natural (or synthetic) F albumen such as SEQ ID NO:2, make that main immunogenic epi-position back (for example in vivo, for example the experimenter being used the back) in PreF antigen transfered cell or extracellular environment of the preceding conformation of t"
