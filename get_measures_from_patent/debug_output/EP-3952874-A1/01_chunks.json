    "ient and a compound according to the invention as an active ingredient. In addition, it may include other medicinal or pharmaceutical agents, carriers, adjuvants, etc. </p> [9226] Exemplary parenteral administration forms include solutions or suspensions of active compound in sterile aqueous solutions, for example, aqueous propylene glycol or dextrose solutions. Such dosage forms can be suitably buffered, if desired. </p> Methods of Use </p> [0227} The method typically comprises administering to a subject a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention. The therapeutically effective amount of the subject combination of compounds may vary depending upon the intended application (in vitro or in vivo), or the subject and disease condition being treated, e.g., the weight and age of the subject, the severity of the disease condition, the manner of administration and the like, which can readily be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. The term also applies to a dose that will induce a particular response in target cells, e.g., reduction of proliferation or downregulation of activity of a target protein. The specific dose will vary depending on the particular compounds chosen, the dosing regimen to be followed, whether it is administered in combination with other compounds, \n\n timing of administration, the tissue to which it is administered, and the physical delivery system in which it is carried. </p> [0228] As used herein, the term \"ICso\" refers to the half maximal inhibitory concentration of an inhibitor in inhibiting biological or biochemical function. This quantitative measure indicates how much of a particular inhibitor is needed to inhibit a given biological process (or component of a process, i.e. an enzyme, cell, cell receptor or microorganism) by half. In other words, it is the half maximal (50%) inhibitory concentration (IC) of a substance (50% IC, or IC50). EC50 refers to the plasma concentration required for obtaining 50%&gt; of a maximum effect in vivo. </p> [0229] In some embodiments, the subject methods utilize a PRMT5 inhibitor with an IC50 value of about or less than a predetermined value, as ascertained in an in vitro assay. In some embodiments, the PRMT5 inhibitor inhibits PRMT5 a with an IC50 value of about 1 nM or less, 2 nM or less, 5 nM or less, 7 nM or less, 10 nM or less, 20 nM or less, 30 nM or less, 40 nM or less, 50 nM or less, 60 nM or less, 70 nM or less, 80 nM or less, 90 nM or less, 100 nM or less, 120 nM or less, 140 nM or less, 150 nM or less, 160 nM or less, 170 nM or less, 180 nM or less, 190 nM or less, 200 nM or less, 225 nM or less, 250 nM or less, 275 nM or less, 300 nM or less, 325 nM or less, 350 nM or less, 375 nM or less, 400 nM or less, 425 nM or less, 450 nM or less, 475 nM or less, 500 nM or less, 550 nM or less, 600 nM or less, 650 nM or less, 700 nM or less, 750 nM or less, 800 nM or less, 850 nM or less, 900 nM or less, 950 nM or less, 1 mM or less, 1.1 mM or less, 1.2 mM or less, 1.3 mM or less, 1.4 mM or less, 1.5 mM or less, 1.6 mM or less, 1.7 mM or less, 1.8 mM or less, 1.9 mM or less, 2 mM or less, 5 mM or less, 10 mM or less, 15 mM or less, 20 mM or less, 25 mM or less, 30 mM or less, 40 mM or less, 50 mM, 60 mM, 70 mM, 80 mM, 90 mM, 100 mM, 200 mM, 300 mM, 400 mM, or 500 mM, or less, (or a number in the range defined by and including any two numbers above). </p> [0230] In some embodiments, the PRMT5 inhibitor selectively inhibits PRMT5 a with an IC50 value that is at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 100, or 1000 times less (or a number in the range defined by and including any two numbers above)than its IC50 value against one, two, or three other PRMTs. </p> [02311 In some embodiments, the PRMT5 inhibitor selectively inhibits PRMT5 a with an IC50 value that is less than about 1 nM, 2 nM, 5 nM, 7 nM, 10 nM, 20 nM, 30 nM, 40 nM, 50 nM, 60 nM, 70 nM, 80 nM, 90 nM, 100 nM, 120 nM, 140 nM, 150 nM, 160 nM, 170 nM, 180 nM, 190 nM, 200 nM, 225 nM, 250 nM, 275 nM, 300 nM, 325 nM, 350 nM, 375 nM, 400 nM, 425 nM, 450 \n\n nM, 475 nM, 500 nM, 550 nM, 600 nM, 650 nM, 700 nM, 750 nM, 800 nM, 850 nM, 900 nM, 950 nM, 1 mM, 1.1 mM, 1.2 mM, 1.3 mM, 1.4 mM, 1.5 mM, 1.6 mM, 1.7 mM, 1.8 mM, 1.9 mM, 2 mM, 5 mM, 10 mM, 15 mM, 20 mM, 25 mM, 30 mM, 40 mM, 50 mM, 60 mM, 70 mM, 80 mM, 90 mM, 100 mM, 200 mM, 300 mM, 400 mM, or 500 mM (or in the range defined by and including any two numbers above), and said IC50 value is at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 100, or 1000 times less (or a number in the range defined by and including any two numbers above) than its IC50 value against one, two or three other PRMTs. </p> [0232] The subject methods are useful for treating a disease or disorder associated with PRMT5. Any disease or disorder that results directly or indirectly from an abnormal activity or expression level of PRMT5 can be an intended disease or disorder. </p> [0233} Examples of diseases or disorders associated with PRMT5 that may be treated with compounds of the disclosure include lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis, hidradenitis suppurativa, C3 glomerulopathy, ANCA associated vasculitis, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, relapsing polychondroitis, polymyositis, bullous dermatoses, bronchiectasis, pulmonary hypertension, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, transplanted organs or tissue; graft-versus-host diseases brought about by transplantation; acute respiratory distress syndrome; adult respiratory distress syndrome; </p>influenza; COVID-19 (coronavirus disease); systemic erythematosus; Hashimoto's thyroiditis; </p>lymphocytic thyroiditis; multiple sclerosis; myasthenia gravis, uveitis; posterior uveitis; uveitis associated with Behcet's disease; uveomeningitis syndrome; allergic encephalomyelitis; chronic allograft vasculopathy; rheumatic fever and post-infectious glomerulonephritis, atopic dermatitis; osteomyelitis; contact dermatitis; eczematous dermatitis; seborrhoeic dermatitis; lichen planus; pemphigus; bullous pemphigoid; epi"
