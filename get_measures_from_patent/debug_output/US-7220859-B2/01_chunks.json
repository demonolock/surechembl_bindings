    "RELATED APPLICATIONThis application claims priority benefit under Title 35 \u00a7 119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/643,271, filed Jan. 12, 2005, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.</p>BACKGROUNDDelta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol or Delta-9 THC, the principle active component of Cannabis sativa (marijuana), is a member of a large family of lipophilic compounds (i.e., cannabinoids) that mediate physiological and psychotropic effects including regulation of appetite, immunosuppression, analgesia, inflammation, emesis, anti-nocioception, sedation, and intraocular pressure. Other members of the cannabinoid family include the endogenous (arachidonic acid-derived) ligands, anandamide, 2-arachidonyl glycerol, and 2-arachidonyl glycerol ether. Cannabinoids work through selective binding to and activation of G-protein coupled cannabinoid receptors. Two types of cannabinoid receptors have been cloned including CB-1 (L. A. Matsuda, et al., Nature, 346, 561\u2013564 (1990)), and CB-2 (S. Munro, et al., Nature, 365, 61\u201365 (1993)). The CB-1 receptor is highly expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems (M. Glass, et al., Neuroscience, 77, 299\u2013318 (1997)), while the CB-2 receptor is highly expressed in immune tissue, particularly in spleen and tonsils. The CB-2 receptor is also expressed on other immune system cells, such as lymphoid cells (S. Galiegue, et al., Eur J Biochem, 232, 54\u201361 (1995)). Agonist activation of cannabinoid receptors results in inhibition of cAMP accumulation, stimulation of MAP kinase activity, and closure of calcium channels.</p>There exists substantial evidence that cannabinoids regulate appetitive behavior. Stimulation of CB-1 activity by anandamide or Delta-9 THC results in increased food intake and weight gain in multiple species including humans (Williams and Kirkham, Psychopharm., 143, 315\u2013317 (1999)). Genetic knock-out of CB-1 result in mice that were hypophagic and lean relative to wild-type litter mates (DiMarzo, et al., Nature, 410, 822\u2013825 (2001)). Published studies with CB-1 small molecule antagonists have demonstrated decreased food intake and body weight in rats (Trillou, et. al., Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol., R345-R353, (2003)). Chronic administration of the CB-1 antagonist AM-251 for two weeks resulted in substantial body weight reduction and decreased adipose tissue mass (Hildebrandt, et. al., Eur. J. Pharm, 462, 125\u2013132 (2003)). There are multiple studies that have assessed the anorexic effect of the Sanofi CB-1 antagonist, SR-141716 (Rowland, et. al., Pyschopharm., 159, 111-116 (2001); Colombo, et. al., Life Sci., 63, 113-117 (1998)). There are at least two CB-1 antagonists in clinical trials for regulation of appetite, Sanofi's SR-141716 and Solvay's SLV-319. Published Phase IIb data reveal that SR-141716 dose-dependently reduced body weight in human subjects over a 16 week trial period. CB-1 antagonists have also been shown to promote cessation of smoking beha",

The product described above (14.5 mg, 0.031 mmol) was stirred in pyridine (2.0 mL) at room temperature under argon and treated with Lawesson's reagent (25.3 mg, 0.063 mmol). The mixture was heated to reflux for 4 h, cooled to room temperature and an additional portion of Lawesson's reagent (15 mg) was added. After 15 h, additional Lawesson's reagent (20 mg) was added. After an additional 24 h, the reaction mixture was cooled, evaporated and partitioned between water and EtOAc. The organic phase was evaporated and the foul-smelling residue was purified by gravity chromatography on silica gel (1:5 EtOAc/CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>) to give the title compound as an odorless yellow oil (9.7 mg, 68% yield).

Total assay volume for the binding studies was 100 \u03bcl. 5 \u03bcg of membranes were brought up to a final volume of 95 \u03bcl with Binding Buffer (25 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.25% BSA). The diluted membranes were preincubated with a compound or DMSO vehicle. The binding reaction was initiated by the addition of 2 nM final <sup>3</sup>H-CP-55,940 (120 Ci/mmol) and proceeded for 2.5 hours at room temperature. The binding reaction was terminated by transferring the reaction to GF/B 96 well plates (presoaked with 0.3% polyethylenimine) using a Packard Cell Harvester. The filter was washed with 0.25\u00d7PBS, 30 \u03bcl MicroScint was added per well, and the bound radiolabel was quantitated by scintillation counting on a Packard TopCount Scintillation Counter. The CB-2 radioligand binding assay was conducted identically except that the membranes from CHO-CB-2 cells were used.</p>For a compound to be considered a CB-1 antagonist, the compound must possess a CB-1 receptor binding affinity Ki less than 13000 nM. As determined by the assay described above, the CB-1 receptor binding K<sub>i </sub>values of the working Examples fall within the range of 0.01 nM to 10000 nM.</p>Cannabinoid Receptor Functional Activity Assay</p>Functional CB-1 inverse agonist activity of test compounds was determined in CHO-CB-1 cells using a cAMP accumulation assay. CHO-CB-1 cells were grown in 96 well plates to near confluence. On the day of the functional assay, growth medium was aspirated and 100 of Assay Buffer (PBS plus 25 mM HEPES/0.1 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine/0.1% BSA) was added. Compounds were added to the Assay buffer diluted 1:100 from 100% DMSO and allowed to preincubate for 10 minutes prior to addition of 5 uM forskolin. The mixture was allowed to proceed for 15 minutes at room temperature and was terminated by the addition of 0.1 N HCl. The total intracellular cAMP concentration was quantitated using the Amersham cAMP SPA kit.</p>UTILITIES AND COMBINATIONSUtilities</p>The compounds of the present invention are cannabinoid receptor modulators, and include compounds which are, for example, selective agonists, partial agonists, inverse agonists, antagonists or partial antagonists of the cannabinoid receptor.
