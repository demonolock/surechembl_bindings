    "cubated for \u02dc40-48 h in a fresh DMEM containing 5% CS-FBS with various concentrations of ligands. Cell lysates are produced using reporter lysis buffer (Promega) according to the manufacturer's directions. Luciferase and galactosidase activities in cell extracts are determined using Luciferase Assay Buffer (Promega) and \u03b2-D-galactopyranoside (Calbiochem) respectively. Reference: Cui et al., J. Biol. Chem., 278:10214-10220 (2003).</p>CB1 Assay: CB1 assay is done according to the procedures as described by Rinaldi-Carmona et al. (1995). Membranes are isolated either from CHO cells over expressing either hCB1 or from the brain tissue according to standard procedures. Membranes are incubated with [<sup>3</sup>H]-CP 55,940 (0.2 nM) in 1 ml of buffer A for 1 h. Membranes are harvested by rapid filtration technique using Whatman GF/C filters [preheated with 0.5% (w/v) polyethylenimine; Whatman, Clifton, N.J.], and a 48-well filtration apparatus (Brandel Inc., Gaithersburg, Md.). The labeled membranes are rinsed 3 times with 5 ml of cold buffer A containing 0.25% bovine serum albumin. The radioactivity is counted which bind to the filters with 4 ml of biofluor liquid scintillant. The non-specific binding is determined in the presence of 1 \u03bcM CP 55,940.

Niacin binding assay is done by incubating the membranes with [3H]niacin at the appropriate concentrations of the membranes and the binding is assessed with a filter binding assay as described by Lorenzen et al., (2001).

Pharmacol., 59: 349-357 (2001).</p>Assay for DGAT2: Crude microsomal fractions are prepared for DGAT2 assay from murine livers. The synthesis of triacylglycerol from radioactive diacylglycerol is measured using crude microsomes as described by Dolinsky et al., (2004). A substrate suspension of 25 \u03bcM dioleoylglycerol (50000 d.p.m/assay) and 50 \u03bcM oleoyl-CoA is prepared by sonication in the assay buffer. The assay buffer contain 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 mM NaF, 1 mM dithiothreitol and 0.1% CHAPS. The reaction is initiated by the addition of microsomes (50 \u03bcg) to the assay mixture in a final volume of 200 \u03bcl. The reaction is proceeded for 10 min at 37\u00b0 C. and is terminated by the addition of 4 \u03bcl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and 750 \u03bcl of water. Samples are centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min to separate organic and aqueous phases. The aqueous phase is removed and the organic phase is dried under nitrogen. Lipids are resuspended in 50 \u03bcl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and spotted on a TLC plate. Lipids are separated in hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (80:20:1, by vol.) and visualize by staining in iodine vapour. Radioactive TAG is determined by scintillation counting.
