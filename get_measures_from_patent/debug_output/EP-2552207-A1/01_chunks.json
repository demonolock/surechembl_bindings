    "nutes of rest time at room temperature, Fluo3AM-loaded cell plates, and the sweetener/compound plate mixture were loaded into a Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR) (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Imaging was performed using a 480 nm excitation and a 535 emission and was initiated with the acquisition of the baseline fluorescence for a period of 7 seconds. Then, the cells were stimulated on line with addition of 25 ml stimuli/well. Subsequent images were acquired every other second for a period of 2 minutes. Raw fluorescence counts were then normalized in each well (using custom made data import software) by calculating delta F/f values (maximum fluorescent count obtained after stimulation - minimal fluorescent count obtained before stimulation/minimal fluorescent count obtained before stimulation). EC<sub>50</sub>s were determined using a non-linear regression algorithm (GraphPad PRISM, San Diego, CA), where the Hill slope, bottom asymptotes and top asymptotes were allow to vary. Enhancement properties of test compounds were quantified by determining the magnitude of the leftward shift in the sweeteners EC<sub>50</sub> values (or an EC<sub>50</sub> ratio): the value of the EC<sub>50</sub> measured in the absence of the enhancer divided by the value of the EC<sub>50</sub> measured in the presence of the enhancer). The present compounds have been tested and shown sweet taste enhancing activities for sucrose as shown in Table A , Table B and C below. Specifically, the EC50 ratio of the test compounds for sucrose enhancement are all greater than about 2 at about \n\n 50 \u03bcM. The compounds listed in Table A , Table B and C below are Examples described above. For example, Compound Q in Table A is Example 7. \n\n</p></p>\n The present compounds have been tested and shown sweet taste enhancing activities for sucralose as shown in Table D below. Specifically, the EC50 ratio of the test compounds for sucralose enhancement are all greater than about 2 at about 10 \u03bcM. </p></p>\n EXPERIMENT 2: Sweet Flavor and Sweet Flavor Enhancement Measurement Using Human Panelists Conducting a Scaling Test </p> Test samples containing experimental compounds were compared to a dose-response curve for perceived sweetness intensity of sweeteners (sucralose, sucrose, fructose and other sweeteners) concentrations to determine equivalent sweetness intensity. </p> A group of eight or more panelists tasted solutions including sweeteners at various concentrations, as well as the experimental compound both with and without added sweetener. Panelists then rated sweetness intensity of all samples on a structured horizontal line scale, anchored from 0 to 15, where 0 equals no sweetness and 15 equals equivalent sweetness to a 15% sucrose sample. Scores for sweetness intensity were averaged across panelists. Then using \n\n the average scores and/or equation of the line for the sweetener dose-response curve, equivalent sweetness concentrations were determined for the samples containing experimental compounds. </p> Subjects had been previously familiarized with the key attribute taste and were trained to use the 0 to 15 point line scale. Subjects refrained from eating or drinking (except water) for at least 1 hour prior to the test. Subjects ate a cracker and rinsed with water several times to clean the mouth. </p> Sweetener solutions are provided at a wide range of con"
