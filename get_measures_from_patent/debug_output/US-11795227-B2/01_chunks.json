The CM5 or NTA chip, research grade would be performed for SPR analysis by BIAcore T200 (Biacore-GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.). Briefly, protein (PD-L1, HLA-G or CD3 recombinant protein) sample was diluted in the 10 mM buffer solutions (pH 4.0, 5.5 or 6.0) at the concentration range of 20 \u03bcg/mL to give maximum surface retention for immobilization on the chip, following the preparation process and choosing the condition of higher surface concentration of ligands (with 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, 1.5625 and 0.78125 nM) on the chip. Then the regeneration scouting and surface performance test, following regeneration scouting and surface performance test and then regeneration method was selected to run the experiment. And then binding analysis and direct binding were selected to investigate protein binding. the kinetic analysis would be selected and choose mass transfer was chosen to run kinetic assay accompany with binding experiment. Data analysis and kinetic constants were determined.</p>The SPR binding assay result of the Nb-TriTE is shown in FIGS. 2A-2C, wherein FIG. 2A shows SPR kinetics assay of PD-L1 binding to Nb-TriTE, wherein the ligand is PD-L1; analyte concentrations are 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, 1.5625, 0.78125 nM; flow rate is 30 \u03bcL/min; association time is 120 seconds; dissociation time is 900 seconds; Atezolizumab is a monoclonal antibody medication used to treat urothelial carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and it is a fully humanized, engineered monoclonal antibody of IgG1 isotype against the protein programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1); Anti-PDL1 represents anti-PD-L1 nanobody.
