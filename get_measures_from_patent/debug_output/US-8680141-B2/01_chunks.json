Mass spectra were run to confirm the nature of the derivatives but the product(s) weren't purified for this preliminary screen of growth-inhibiting activity in a human tumor cell line. The results were compared on the assumption that no losses occurred during derivatisation.</p>EBI-23 lost most of its activity with hydrogenation and oxidation (presumably due to loss of the double bond) whereas acetylation of the OH or epoxidation of the double bond had less effect. The related structure EBI-24 with a double bond in the long side chain was 10-fold less potent than EBI-23 and only hydrogenation caused loss of activity. EBI-25 was the least potent of this series. It became more active after epoxidation, perhaps as a consequence of increased polarity counteracting the acetylated OH.</p>Example 15Morphological and Cell Cycle Effects of EBI-23</p>At doses close to the IC50, no distinctive change in morphology such as apoptosis was observed with these compounds. This tends to rule out targets such as PKC (prototype compound PMA), DNA damage (prototype cisplatin), kinases (prototype staurosporine), mitochondria or the plasma membrane (cell lysis).</p>Flow cytometry of several cell lines after 24 hour treatment with 1 \u03bcg/mL EBI-23 suggests a variable degree of G2/M arrest. This was not accompanied, however, by the typical rounded morphology of cells treated with tubulin ligands. No DNA fragments were detected, reinforcing the visual observation that little if any apoptosis occurred.</p>Example 16Inhibition of B16 Melanoma Growth by EBI-23 in C57BL/6 Mice</p>After a preliminary experiment to determine the MTD in mice, C57BL/6 mice were implanted with B16 melanoma cells (0.5 million cells per site, 2 sites per mouse sc, 3 mice/group) and treatment commenced 24 hours later. For this initial study, EBI-23 was prepared by diluting an ethanol solution into saline, such that the final ethanol level was 2%. The cloudy solution thus obtained was injected intraperitoneally into mice every day for 7 days. Tumor size and body weight were measured over time.</p>The results (FIG. 4) showed a dose-related response, with a significant reduction in B16 growth by a dose of 250 \u03bcg/mouse/day, and a measurable response at 80 \u03bcg.</p>The mice tolerated this regime well, except there was some weight loss at the higher dose. Treatment was discontinued at 13 days beca"
