    "f in vivo efficacy. </p> The same assay has been used to test clearing of an antibody against a fragment of synuclein referred to as NAC. Synuclein has been shown to be an amyloid plaque-associated protein. An antibody to NAC was contacted with a brain tissue sample containing amyloid plaques, an microglial cells, as before. Rabbit serum was used as a control. Subsequent monitoring showed a marked reduction in the number and size of plaques indicative of clearing activity of the antibody.  \nTABLE 17The ex vivo assay as predictor of in vivo efficacy.Avidity forBinding toaggregated\u03b2-amyloidEx vivoIn vivoAntibodyIsotypeA\u03b2 (pM)plaquesefficacyefficacymonoclonal3D6IgG2b470+++10D5IgG143+++16C11IgG190\u2212\u2212\u221221F12IgG2a500\u2212\u2212\u2212TM2aIgG1\u2014\u2212\u2212\u2212polyclonal1-42mix600+++\n</p> Confocal microscopy was used to confirm that A\u03b2 was internalized during the course of the ex vivo assay. In the presence of control antibodies, the exogenous microglial cells remained in a confocal plane above the tissue, there were no phagocytic vesicles containing A\u03b2, and the plaques remained intact within the section. In the presence of 10D5, nearly all plaque material was contained in vesicles within the exogenous microglial cells. To determine the fate of the internalized peptide, 10D5 treated cultures were extracted with 8M urea at various time-points, and examined by Western blot analysis. At the one hour time point, when no phagocytosis had yet occurred, reaction with a polyclonal antibody against A\u03b2 revealed a strong 4 kD band (corresponding to the A\u03b2 peptide). A\u03b2 immunoreactivity decreased at day 1 and was absent by day 3. Thus, antibody-mediated phagocytosis of A\u03b2 leads to its degradation. </p> To determine if phagocytosis in the ex vivo assay was Fc-mediated, F(ab\u2032)2 fragments of the anti-A\u03b2 antibody 3D6 were prepared. Although the F(ab\u2032)2 fragments retained their full ability to react with plaques, they were unable to trigger phagocytosis by microglial cells. In addition, phagocytosis with the whole antibody could be blocked by a reagent against murine Fc receptors (anti-CD16/32). These data indicate that in vivo clearance of A\u03b2 occurs through Fc-receptor mediated phagocytosis. </p> XV: Passage of Antibodies through Blood Brain Barrier </p> This example determines the concentration of antibody delivered to the brain following intravenous injection into a peripheral tissue of either normal or PDAPP mice. PDAPP or control normal mice were perfused with 0.9% NaCl. Brain regions (hippocampus or cortex) were dissected and rapidly frozen. Brain were homogenized in 0.1% triton+protease inhibitors. Immunoglobulin was detected in the extracts by ELISA. Fab\u20322 Goat Anti-mouse IgG were coated onto an RIA plate as capture reagent. The serum or the brain extracts were incubated for 1 hr. The isotypes were detected with anti-mouse IgG1-HRP or IgG2a-HRP or IgG2b-HRP (Caltag). Antibodies, regardless of isotype, were present in the CNS at a concentration that is 1:1000 that found in the blood. For exampl"
