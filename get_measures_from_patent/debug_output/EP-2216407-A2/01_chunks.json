    "n cells having LOH. The regions of LOH will often include a gene, the loss of which promotes unwanted proliferation, e.g., a tumor suppressor gene, and other sequences including, e.g., other genes, in some cases a gene which is essential for normal function, e.g., growth. Methods of the invention rely, in part, on the specific cleavage or silencing of one allele of an essential gene with an iRNA agent of the invention. The iRNA agent is selected such that it targets the single allele of the essential gene found in the cells having LOH but does not silence the other allele, which is present in cells which do not show LOH. In essence, it discriminates between the two alleles, preferentially silencing the selected allele. In essence polymorphisms, e.g., SNPs of essential genes that are affected by LOH, are used as a target for a disorder characterized by cells having LOH, e.g., cancer cells having LOH.</p>E.g., one of ordinary skill in the art can identify essential genes which are in proximity to tumor suppressor genes, and which are within a LOH region which includes the tumor suppressor gene. The gene encoding the large subunit of human RNA polymerase II, POLR2A, a gene located in close proximity to the tumor suppressor gene p53, is such a gene. It frequently occurs within a region of LOH in cancer cells. Other genes that occur within LOH regions and are lost in many cancer cell types include the group comprising replication protein A 70-kDa subunit, replication protein A 32-kD, ribonucleotide reductase, thymidilate synthase, TATA associated factor 2H, ribosomal protein S 14, eukaryotic initiation factor 5A, alanyl tRNA synthetase, cysteinyl tRNA synthetase, NaK ATPase, alpha-1 subunit, and transferrin receptor.</p>Accordingly, the invention features, a method of treating a disorder characterized by LOH, e.g., cancer. The method includes:\noptionally, determining the genotype of the allele of a gene in the region of LOH and preferably determining the genotype of both alleles of the gene in a normal cell;providing an iRNA agent which preferentially cleaves or silences the allele found in the LOH cells;administerning the iRNA to the subject,thereby treating the disorder.</p>The invention also includes a iRNA agent disclosed herein, e.g, an iRNA agent which can preferentially silence, e.g., cleave, one allele of a polymorphic gene</p>In another aspect, the invention provides a method of cleaving or silencing more than one gene with an iRNA agent. In these embodiments the iRNA agent is selected so that it has sufficient homology to a sequence found in more than one gene. For example, the sequence AAGCTGGCCCTGGACATGGAGAT (SEQ ID NO:6736) is conserved between mouse lamin B1, lamin B2, keratin complex 2-gene 1 and lamin A/C. Thus an iRNA agent targeted to this sequence would effectively silence the entire collection of genes.</p>The invention also includes an iRNA agent disclosed herein, which can silence more than one gene.</p>ROUTE OF DELIVERYFor ease "
