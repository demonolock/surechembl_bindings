In this embodiment, muscarinic receptor binding data (e.g., as determined by in vitro radioligand displacement assays) for a test compound or a group of test compounds is compared to the muscarinic receptor binding data for a compound of the invention to identify those test compounds that have about equal or superior muscarinic receptor binding, if any. This aspect of the invention includes, as separate embodiments, both the generation of comparison data (using the appropriate assays) and the analysis of the test data to identify test compounds of interest. In another embodiment, compounds of the invention are used to antagonize a muscarinic receptor in a biological system, and a mammal in particular such as mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, dogs, pigs, humans and so forth. In this embodiment, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I is administered to the \n\nmammal. The effects of antagonizing the muscarinic receptor can then determined using conventional procedures and equipment, examples of which are described above.</p>\n  Among other properties, compounds of the invention have been found to be potent inhibitors of M<sub>3</sub> muscarinic receptor activity. Accordingly, in a specific embodiment, the invention is directed to compounds of formula I having an inhibition dissociation constant (Kj) for the M<sub>3</sub> receptor subtype of less than or equal to 10 nM, as determined, for example, by an in vitro radioligand displacement assay. In one embodiment, compounds of the invention have a Kj value for the M<sub>3</sub> receptor subtype of less than or equal to 5 nM.</p>\n  Additionally, compounds of the invention are expected to possess a desirable duration of action. Accordingly, in another specific embodiment, the invention is directed to compounds of formula I having a duration of action greater than or equal to about 24 hours. Moreover, compounds of the invention are also expected to possess reduced side effects, such as dry mouth, at efficacious doses when administered by inhalation compared to other known muscarinic receptor antagonists administered by inhalation (such as tiotropium).</p>\n  These and other properties, as well as the utility of the compounds, can be demonstrated using various in vitro and in vivo assays that are well-known to those skilled in the art. For example, representative assays are described in further detail in the following Examples. EXAMPLES</p>\n  The Preparations and Examples illustrate specific embodiments of the invention.

The cells were grown in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 37 <sup>0</sup>C incubator and lifted with 2 rnM EDTA in dPBS. Cells were collected by 5 minute centrifugation at 650 x g, and cell pellets were either stored frozen at \u201480 <sup>0</sup>C or membranes were prepared immediately. For membrane preparation, cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer and homogenized with a Polytron PT-2100 tissue disrupter (Kinematica AG; 20 seconds x 2 bursts). Crude membranes were centrifuged at 40,000 x g for 15 minutes at 4 \u00b0C. The membrane pellet was then resuspended with resuspension buffer and homogenized again with the Polytron tissue disrupter. The protein concentration of the membrane suspension was determined by the method described in Lowry, O. et al., Journal of Biochemistry 193:265 (1951). All membranes were stored frozen in aliquots at -80 <sup>0</sup>C or used immediately. Aliquots of prepared hM<sub>5</sub> receptor membranes were purchased directly from Perkin Elmer and stored at -80 \u00b0C until use.</p>\n  Radioligand Binding Assay on Muscarinic Receptor Subtypes hMj, I1M<sub>2</sub>, 11M<sub>3</sub>, 11M<sub>4</sub> and hMs</p>\n  Radioligand binding assays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates in a total assay volume of 100 \u03bcL. CHO cell membranes stably expressing either the ILM<sub>1</sub>, hM<sub>2</sub>, hM<sub>3</sub>, hM<sub>4</sub> or I1M<sub>5</sub> muscarinic subtype were diluted in assay buffer to the following specific target protein concentrations (\u03bcg/well): 10 \u03bcg for !1M<sub>1</sub>, 10-15 \u03bcg for hM<sub>2</sub>, 10-20 \u03bcg for hM<sub>3</sub>, 10-20 \u03bcg for hM<sub>4</sub>, and 10-12 \u03bcg for hM<sub>5</sub>. The membranes were briefly homogenized using a Polytron tissue disruptor (10 seconds) prior to assay plate addition. Saturation binding studies for determining K^ values of the radioligand were performed using L-[N- methyl-<sup>3</sup>H] scopolamine methyl chloride ([<sup>3</sup>H]-NMS) (TRK666, 84.0 Ci/mmol, Amersham \n\nPharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, England) at concentrations ranging from 0.001 nM to 20 nM. Displacement assays for determination of K, values of test compounds were performed with [<sup>3</sup>H]-NMS at 1 nM and eleven different test compound concentrations. The test compounds were initially dissolved to a concentration of 400 \u03bcM in dilution buffer and then serially diluted 5x with dilution buffer to final concentrations ranging from 10 pM to 100 \u03bcM. The addition order and volumes to the assay plates were as follows: 25 \u03bcL radioligand, 25 \u03bcL diluted test",
    "ted with dilution buffer to final molar concentrations ranging from 100 \u03bcM to 0.1 nM. Oxotremorine is diluted in a similar manner.</p>\n  To measure oxotremorine inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity, 25 \u03bcL forskolin (25 \u03bcM final concentration diluted in dPBS), 25 \u03bcL diluted oxotremorine, and 50 \u03bcL cells are added to agonist assay wells. To measure the ability of a test compound to block oxotremorine-inhibited AC activity, 25 \u03bcL forskolin and oxotremorine (25 \u03bcM and 5 \u03bcM final concentrations, respectively, diluted in dPBS) 25 \u03bcL diluted test compound, and 50 \u03bcL cells are added to remaining assay wells. Reactions are incubated for 10 minutes at 37 <sup>0</sup>C and stopped by addition of 100 \u03bcL ice-cold detection buffer. Plates are sealed, incubated overnight at room temperature and counted the next morning on a PerkinElmer TopCount liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Inc., Wellesley, MA). The amount of cAMP produced (pmo I/well) is calculated based on the counts observed for the samples and cAMP standards, as described in the manufacturer's user manual. Data are analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis with the GraphPad Prism Software package (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using the non-linear regression, one-site competition equation. The Cheng-Prusoff equation is used to calculate the Kj, using the EC<sub>50</sub> of the oxotremorine concentration- response curve and the oxotremorine assay concentration as the K<sub>D</sub> and [L], respectively. The Ki values are converted to pKj values to determine the geometric mean and 95% confidence intervals. These summary statistics are then converted back to Kj values for data reporting.</p>\n  In this assay, a lower Kj value indicates that the test compound has a higher \n\nfunctional activity at the receptor tested. Compounds of the invention are expected to have a K; value of less than about 10 nM for blockade of oxotremorine-inhibition of forskolin-mediated cAMP accumulation in CHO-Kl cells expressing the hM<sub>2</sub> receptor, when tested in this or a similar assay. Blockade of Agonist-Mediated [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPyS Binding</p>\n  In a second functional assay, the functional potency of test compounds can be determined by measuring the ability of the compounds to block oxotremorine-stimulated [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPyS binding in CHO-Kl cells expressing the hM<sub>2</sub> receptor.</p>\n  At the time of use, frozen membranes are thawed and then diluted in assay buffer with a final target tissue concentration of 5- 10 \u03bcg protein per well. The membranes are briefly homogenized using a Polytron PT-2100 tissue disrupter and then added to the assay plates.</p>\n  The EC9<sub>0</sub> value (effective concentration for 90% maximal response) for stimulation of [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPyS binding by the agonist oxotremorine is determined in each experiment. To determine the ability of a test compound to inhibit oxotremorine-stimulated</p>\n  [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPyS binding, me following is added to each"
