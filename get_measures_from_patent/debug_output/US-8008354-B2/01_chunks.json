These compounds differ only by the presence of an ethyl versus a methyl substitution on the position 3 of the dihydrobenzoimidazol group, in 5569100 and 5541203, respectively. 5569100 is approximately 5-times more potent than 5541203 as a FAS-sensitizer in PPC1 cells (EC50 5.6 \u03bcM versus 25.7 \u03bcM) but also is 3-times more toxic when added alone (without anti-FAS antibody) to cultures of PPC1 cells (LD50 15 \u03bcM versus 45 \u03bcM). Interestingly, while 5569100 reduced FLIP expression when applied to tumor cells by itself (without anti-FAS antibody), 5541203 had little effect. This observation implies that substitution of long alkyl groups to the dihydro-benzoimidazol ring may favor FLIP suppression. Additional substitutions at this position in the dihydro-benzoimidazol ring of 5569100 may provide further compounds with improved potencies.</p>Discussion</p>Most high throughput screens are designed to identify molecules that interact with specific protein targets. In contrast, the study described here utilized a chemical biology approach to identify molecules that reverse the phenotype of FAS resistance. With the cell-based, high throughput assay, 9 compounds were identified from a library of 50,000 that reversed resistance of PPC-1 cells to CH-11 anti-FAS antibody. The molecules differed in their dose-response curves with some compounds displaying FAS-independent toxicity at higher doses, while enhancing death receptor-mediated killing at lower concentrations. Some compounds such as 5934859 reversed FAS resistance only for PPC-1 cells, while other compounds such as 6094911 were more broadly acting, sensitizing 4 of 10 tumor lines to extrinsic pathway stimuli. These differences among compounds likely reflect different mechanisms of action and differen",
    " anoikis was investigated. PPC-1 cells were cultured under suspension conditions with increasing concentrations of 5809354 and the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. z-VAD-fmk inhibited the ability of 5809354 to promote anoikis, demonstrating a caspase-dependent mechanism of anoikis (FIG. 15A). To determine the sequence of caspase activation in 5809354-mediated anoikis, PPC-1 cells were treated with 5809354 (60 \u03bcM) or buffer under suspension conditions. At increasing times after treatment, caspase activation was detected using cell-permeable FITC-labelled peptides that bind preferentially and irreversibly to active caspases. Active caspase 8 was detected prior to activation of caspases 3/7 and 9 (FIG. 15B). These data suggest that 5809354 can sensitize cells to anoikis by activating the death receptor pathway of caspase activation. Consistent with this observation, immunoblot analysis revealed that 5809354 preferentially activated caspase 8 in cells cultured under suspension but not adherent conditions (FIG. 15C). In contrast to 5809354, staurosporine, an activator of the intrinsic/mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, induced apoptosis in a manner that did not discriminate between suspension and adherent cells (FIG. 15D). Therefore, these data suggest that FLIP down-regulation derepresses a caspase 8-dependent pathway of anoikis.</p>To further evaluate the relationship between FLIP and caspase 8 in anoikis, the effects of 5809354 were studied in two independent models of caspase 8 inhibition. First, caspase 8-deficient E1A-transformed MEFs were found to be resistant to 5809354-mediated anoikis compared to wild-type E1A transformed MEFs (FIG. 15E). Second, overexpression of FLIP or the viral caspase 8 inhibitor CrmA, but not the mitochondrial anti-apoptotic protein BclXL or empty vector, attenuated 5809354-mediated anoikis (FIG. 15F). In contrast, overexpression of BclXL, but not CrmA, protected PPC-1 cells from staurosporine-induced anoikis. These results provide further evidence that decreases in FLIP expression initiates a caspase 8-dependent pathway of anoikis.</p>Genetic and Chemical Down Regulation of FLIP Decreases the in vivo Survival of Circulating Prostate Cancer Cells</p>The abundance and phenotype of circulating cancer cells can influence metastasis and survival (Cristofanilli et al., 2004; Berezovskaya et al., 2005; Moreno et al., 2005). Anoikis serves as a barrier to metastasis as it prevents normally adherent cells from surviving in an anchorage-independent fashion in vivo. FLIP expression contributes to anoikis resistance in vitro, so it was tested whether reductions in cellular FLIP levels could decrease the in vivo survival of circulating prostate cancer cells and thereby decrease the formation of distal tumor formation. dsRed-labelled PPC-1 cells were treated with FLIP siRNA (25 nM), control siRNA (25 nM), 5809354 (30 \u03bcM), or buffer control in culture under adherent conditions. After treatment, cells were injected intravenously into s",
    "5% viable at the time of injection and remained viable for an extended period under adherent conditions.</p>Metastasis of dsRed-PPC-1 cells to the lung was readily quantifiable using image-based analysis (Cairns et al., 2004; Hoffman, 2005). Compared to control siRNA, mice injected with FLIP siRNA treated cells had decreased median tumor number and median total tumor area. Likewise, compared to buffer control, mice injected with 5809354 treated cells had a decreased median total tumor count median total tumor area within the lung (FIGS. 16 and 17). Median survival was not significantly different between mice injected with FLIP siRNA or control siRNA treated cells (33 days versus 26.5 days respectively, p=0.0993, n=9). Median survival of mice injected with 5809354 treated cells was significantly longer than mice injected with control treated cells (32 days versus 20 days respectively, p=0.0002, n=8). Similar reductions in tumor growth were observed in the bones and liver. In contrast to the decrease in tumor formation after intravenous injection, no difference in tumor weight was detected after subcutaneous injection of dsRed-PPC-1 cells treated with 5809354 or buffer alone (data not shown). These results validate that the PPC-1 cells were viable at the time of injection.</p>Taken together, these results indicate that inhibiting FLIP with small molecules or siRNA decrease the survival of circulating tumor cells and thereby decrease tumor formation in distant organs. Thus, the inhibition of FLIP may be a useful anti-metastatic strategy.</p>Discussion</p>Anoikis serves as a barrier to metastasis. Resistance to anoikis permits cancer cells to survive in the systemic circulation and facilitates their metastasis to distant organs. In fact, patients with circulating tumor cells in the peripheral blood after conventional chemotherapy have a worse prognosis compared to patients without these circulating cells (Cristofanilli et al., 2004; Moreno et al., 2005). Therefore, therapeutic strategies that specifically target anoikis-resistance pathways have the potential to decrease metastasis and thereby improve patient survival.</p>Recent studies in non-malignant epithelial cells have shown that anoikis is a self-initiating event that occurs, in part, by activation of the death receptor pathway of apoptosis (Frisch et al., 2001; Aoudjit et al., 2001; Rosen et al., 2002; Rytomaa et al., 1999; Frisch, 1999). In contrast, malignant epithelial cells resist anoikis and survive in an anchorage-independent manner (Glinsky et al., 1997; Zhu et al., 2001; Nishimura et al., 2001).</p>PPC-1 prostate cancer cells were demonstrated to be remarkably resistant to anoikis despite the increased expression of the death receptor Fas and its ligand FasL. In both PPC-1 and DLD-1 cells, a correlation was noted between resistance to anoikis and persistent expression of the caspase 8 inhibitor FLIP after detachment. In contrast, DKS-8 colonic epithelial cells rapidly underwent anoikis",
    "n why metastatic tumors retain malignant potential even though they show increases in FasL expression relative to localized tumors. Reviewing data from gene expression profiling from other tumor sites also revealed that FLIP over-expression was associated with an increased mortality in patients with prostate, breast, and lung cancer (Varambally et al., 2005; Yu et al., 2004; van't Veer et al., 2002; Bhattacharjee et al., 2001). Thus, these results suggest that FLIP is a potential target for novel anti-cancer therapies.</p>Both animal and clinical studies have shown that the presence and phenotype of malignant cells in the circulation can predict metastasis and survival (Berezovskaya et al., 2005; Moreno et al., 2005). To study the contribution of FLIP expression to anoikis-resistance in vivo, a mouse model was employed that measures the ability circulating human prostate cancer cells to form distant tumors. Functional genetic and chemical genetic down-regulation of FLIP was found to reduce the number and area of distant tumors. In this model, FLIP levels were decreased in adherent dsRed PPC-1 cells in culture prior to injection into mice. It is important to note that the cells were viable at the time of injection and remained viable when cultured under adherent conditions for extended periods of time. Furthermore, note that no difference was detected in tumor growth after subcutaneous injection of cells treated with 5809354 or control, indicating the specific effects of FLIP inhibition on anoikis in vivo.</p>The present study supports the hypothesis that the death receptor (extrinsic) pathway of apoptosis can initiate anoikis (Frisch et al., 2001), however, other studies have shown that anoikis involves activation of the mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway of apoptosis (Rosen et al., 2000; Grossmann et al., 2001; Rosen et al., 2001). These apparently opposing concepts can be reconciled by studies showing that death receptor-initiated anoikis can still occur even though blocks in the mitochondrial pathway are present (Rosen et al., 2002). Furthermore, in some cells, apoptosis initiated through the death receptor pathway requires amplification through the mitochondrial pathway of caspase activation (Slee et al., 1999; Kuwana et al., 1998). In these cases, blocks in the mitochondrial pathway can inhibit anoikis (Rytomaa et al., 1999; Jiang et al., 2001). Further studies are needed to assess the relative contribution of these pathways to anoikis. However, it is tempting to speculate that epithelial cells may acquire differential blocks in pro-anoikis pathways depending on the tissues from which they metastasize. Consistent with this concept, recent transciptome and proteome-wide studies on metastatic cells suggest that specific metastatic signatures may exist for cells based on their source and target organ (Varambally et al., 2005; Minn et al., 2005). Future studies that identify pro-metastatic genes may also identify novel suppressors of anoikis.</p>",
