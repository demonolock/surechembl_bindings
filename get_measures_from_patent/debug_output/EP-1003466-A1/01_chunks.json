    "p>Examples of alkaline buffering agents are ammonium hydroxide, ethylamine, dipropylamine, triethylamine and alkanediamines such as 1,3-diaminopropane, anhydrous alkaline alkanolamines such as mono or di-ethanolamine, preferably those which are completely substituted on the amine group such as dimethylaminoethanol, polyalkylene \n\npolyamines such as diethylenetriamine or a heterocyclic amine such as morpholine as well as the hydroxides of alkali metals, such as sodium and potassium hydroxide, hydroxides of alkali earth metals, such as magnesium and calcium hydroxide, basic amino acids such as L-arginine, lysine, alanine, leucine, iso-leucine, oxylysine and histidine and alkanolamines such as dimethylaminoethanol and aminoalkylpropanediol and mixtures thereof. Also suitable for use herein are compounds that form HC0<sub>3</sub><sup>\"</sup> by dissociation in water (hereinafter referred to as \"ion forming compounds\"). Examples of suitable ion forming compounds are Na<sub>2</sub>C0<sub>3</sub>, NaHC0<sub>3</sub>, K<sub>2</sub>C0<sub>3</sub>, (NH4)<sub>2</sub>C0<sub>3</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub>HC0<sub>3</sub>, CaC0<sub>3</sub> and Ca(HC0<sub>3</sub>) and mixtures thereof. These are suitable for buffering to high pH. Preferred for use herein as buffering agents (to low pH) are organic and inorganic acids having a first pKa below pH 6, and their conjugate bases. As defined herein, first pKa means the negative logarithm (to the base 10) of the equilibrium constant, K, where K is the acid dissociation constant. Suitable organic and inorganic acids for use herein are: aspartic, maleic, tartaric, glutamic, glycolic, acetic, succinic, salicylic, formic, benzoic, malic, lactic, malonic, oxalic, citric, phosphoric acid and mixtures thereof. Particularly preferred are acetic, succinic, salicylic and phosphoric acids and mixtures thereof. Catalyst</p>The colouring compositions herein may optionally contain a catalyst for any inorganic peroxygen oxidising agents and the optional preformed peroxy acid oxidising agent(s) . Thickeners</p>The colouring compositions of the present invention may additionally include a thickener at a level of from about 0.05% to about 20%, preferably from about 0.1% to about 10%, more preferably from about 0.5% to about 5% by weight. Thickening agents suitable for use in the \n\ncompositions herein are selected from oleic acid, cetyl alcohol, oleyl alcohol, sodium chloride, cetearyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, synthetic thickeners such as Carbopol, Aculyn and Acrosyl and mixtures thereof. Preferred thickeners for use herein are Aculyn 22 (RTM,) steareth-20 methacrylate copolymer; Aculyn 44 (RTM) polyurethane resin and Acusol 830 (RTM) , acrylate copolymers which are available from Rohm and Haas, Philadelphia, PA, USA. Additional thickening agents suitable for use herein include sodium alginate or gum arabic, or cellulose derivatives, such as methyl cellulose or the sodium salt of carboxymethylcellulose or acrylic polymers.
