The plates were weighed before and after testing and the mass of powder deposited on the plate of each stage was determined. Unless otherwise indicated, studies were undertaken using a traditional Andersen cascade impactor having eight stages (from top to bottom stages 0 to 7) with cut-off sizes ranging from 9.0 to 0.4 \u00b5m, and a final filter stage that traps particles &lt; 0.4 \u00b5m when operated at a flow rate of 28.3 L/min. The device test set-up was similar to the ED test, except that the cascade impactor and a USP (United States Pharmacopia) throat (USP 23, chapter &lt;601&gt;) were attached to the device mouthpiece rather than to a filter. Multiple dispersions were typically conducted for each cascade impaction run to achieve gravimetrically accurate data.</p>The following examples demonstrate the preparation of polymer conjugates of the exemplary retinoids, cis and trans-retinoic acid. Conjugates were prepared using PEGs of various geometries and molecular weights. Exemplary conjugates having linear, forked and branched geometries were prepared with overall PEG molecular weights ranging from 2kD to 20 kD. The representative conjugates were synthesized to contain an ester linkage coupling the polymer arms to the retinoid moiety. Hydrolysis data demonstrating the hydrolytically degradable linkage feature of the conjugates in both buffer and serum are provided in Examples 9 and 10.</p>Example 1Preparation of mPEG (5 kDa) ATRA Ester ConjugateSynthesis of an exemplary PEG-retinoic acid conjugate utilizing a linear PEG having a molecular weight of 5 kD is described below.</p>In a round-bottom flask, 400 mg of ATRA (1.33 mmole, Aldrich) was dissolved in 60 ml of anhydrous benzene.
