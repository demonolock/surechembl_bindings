    " of hepatitis C transmission has been estimated to be 1 in 3,000 units. Schreiber et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 334:1685-90 (1996), incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>Therefore, a red blood cell (\u201cRBC\u201d) substitute has long been sought after. To be effective as a substitute for red blood cells, an RBC substitute ideally will meet several requirements. It must be virus-free, non-toxic and non-immunogenic and it should have satisfactory oxygen carrying capacity and circulatory persistence to permit effective oxygenation of tissues. Preferably, the oxygen affinity should be close to that of whole blood (p50=28 mmHg at 37\u00b0 C.) (Ogden, J. E. et al., Vox Sang 69:302-308 (1995)).</p>Three general classes of blood substitutes have been investigated: perfluorcarbons, liposome encapsulated hemoglobin and hemoglobin derivatives. Perfluorcarbons are inert chemically synthesized compounds that dissolve oxygen. Perfluorcarbons suffer from the disadvantage that they are immiscible in aqueous solutions and thus must be emulsified with lipids before being introduced into the blood stream. Liposomes suffer from structural rigidity, and from a low effective hemoglobin concentration.</p>Because hemoglobin mediates the delivery of oxygen from the lungs to the tissues, purified hemoglobin has been extensively investigated as a possible blood substitute. Hemoglobin is reported to be approximately 97% pure inside the red blood cell. Human hemoglobin is a protein having a molecular weight of 64 kD, and it consists of four subunits, two alpha polypeptide chains and two beta polypeptide chains. Each of the subunits contains a single iron-containing heme prosthetic group that binds and releases oxygen. Hemoglobin exhibits cooperative binding of oxygen by the four subunits of the hemoglobin molecule, and this cooperatively facilitates oxygen transport. When hemoglobin binds oxygen, it shifts from the high energy \u201ctense\u201d or \u201cT\u201d state (deoxygenated) to the lower energy \u201crelaxed\u201d or \u201cR\u201d state (oxygenated). Human alpha and beta globin genes have been cloned and sequenced (Liebhaber et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A). 77:7054-58 (1980); Marotta et al., J. Biol. Chem. 252:5040-43 (1977); and Lawn et al., Cell 21:647 (1980), all of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety).</p>Because of its natural role in oxygen delivery, hemoglobin has long been the target of efforts to develop a blood substitute. The membranes of red blood cells, which are referred to as ghosts or stroma, contain all of the blood type antigens. Rabiner et al. first demonstrated that some of the toxic properties of hemolyzed red blood cells were related to the membrane (stroma) of red blood cells and their related lipids. Rabiner et al., J. Exp. Med. 126:1127 (1967). The membranes are destroyed by freezing so that storage requirements for blood require climate controlled refrigeration. In addition, many of the human viral diseases transmitted through blood transfusions adhere to the stroma "
