    "mposition may include at least one pharmaceutically acceptable component to provide an improved formulation of the compound, such as a suitable carrier or excipient. \n\n [0072] The term \"pharmaceutically acceptable\" indicates that the indicated material does not have properties that would cause a reasonably prudent medical practitioner to avoid administration of the material to a patient, taking into consideration the disease or conditions to be treated and the respective route of administration For example, it is commonly required that such a material be essentially sterile, e g , for mjectibles</p>[0073] In the present context, the term \"therapeutically effective\" or \"effective amount\" indicates that the materials or amount of material is effective to prevent, alleviate, or ameliorate one or more symptoms of a disease or medical condition, and/or to prolong the survival of the subject being treated</p>[0074] In the present context, the terms \"synergistically effective\" or \"synergistic effect\" indicate that two or more compounds that are therapeutically effective, when used in combination, provide improved therapeutic effects greater than the additive ettcct that would be expected based on the effect of each compound used by itself</p>[0075] In the context of compounds binding to a target, the terms \"greater affinity\" and \"selective\" indicates that the compound binds more tightly than a reference compound, or than the same compound m a reference condition, i e , with a lower dissociation constant In some embodiments, the greater affinity is at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 50, 100, 200, 400, 500, 1000, or 10,000-fold greater affinity</p>[0076] As used herein in connection with compounds of the invention, the term \"synthesizing\" and like terms means chemical synthesis from one or more precursor materials</p>[0077] By \"assaying\" is meant the creation of experimental conditions and the gathering of data regarding a particular result of the experimental conditions For example, enzymes can be assayed based on their ability to act upon a detectable substrate A compound or hgand can be assayed based on its ability to bind to a particular target molecule or molecules</p>[0078] As used herein, the term \"modulating\" or \"modulate\" refers to an effect of altering a biological activity, especially a biological activity associated with a particular biomolecule such as a protein kinase For example, an agonist or antagonist of a particular biomolecule modulates the activity of that biomolecule, e g , an enzyme, by either increasing (e g agonist, activator), or decreasing (c g antagonist, inhibitor) the activity of the biomolecule, such as an en/yme Such activity is typically indicated in terms of an inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) or excitation concentration (EC<sub>53</sub>) of the compound for an inhibitor or activator, respectively, with respect to, for example, an enzyme \n\n [0079] In the context of the use, testing, or screening of compounds that are o",
