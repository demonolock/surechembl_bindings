    "tative of two separate experiments. D) Cells were pre-incubated for 24 hours with HF and proline as indicated, and secretion of Type I procollagen was measured after 24 hours in conditioned medium of cells plated by Western blot and quantitated using Image J software (top panel). Total protein synthesis was measured as TCA-precipitable 35 S in a scintillation counter (bottom panel). Error bars reflect standard deviation of triplicate determinations. </p> [0069] Figure 7 depicts a model of AAR activation by inhibition of tRNA charging. </p>[0070] Figure 8 shows that addition of purified EPRS rescuses halofuginone inhibition of translation in vitro. Inhibition of translation in RRL was measured as in Figure 2 in the absence or presence of low (80 ng) or high (0.5 \u03bcg) concentrations of add EPRS purified from rat liver. Note log scale. </p> [0071] Figure 9 shows that MAZ1310 does not block ProRS activity. ProRS activity was assayed as in Figures 10 and 11, except that <sup>14</sup>C Proline was used as trace label rather than <sup>3</sup>H Pro. </p> [0072] Figure 10 depicts determination of [E<sub>t</sub>] and K<sub>m(pro)</sub> for purified ProRS. Left Panel: The concentration of active ProRS [E<sub>t</sub>] was determined by the method of Copeland (Copeland, Methods Bioc em Anal 46: 1-265 (2005)). Briefly, the fractional velocity is \n\n plotted as a function of inhibitor concentration, measured over a concentration range at which [E<sub>t</sub>] is substantially higher than the Ki<sub>(app)</sub>. The point at which the linear portion of the concentration response line intersects the X-axis provides the concentration of active enzyme in the reaction. Right Panel: ProRS synthetase activity was measure as described in methods for Figure 2A. Triplicate determinations at proline concentrations of 15, 40, 120, 240, and 480 \u03bc\u039c were done and reaction velocity plotted versus proline concentration as a double reciprocal (Lineweaver-Burke) plot using linear regression with Graphpad software. </p>[0073] Figure 11 shows that halofuginone inhibits the purified prolyl tRNA synthetase domain of EPRS competitively with proline. The prolyl tRNA synthetase domain of EPRS was expressed in E. coli, purified, and assayed as described, with modifications indicated in the Examples. IC<sub>50</sub> values for HF at proline concentrations of 20, 60, 180, and 480 \u03bc\u039c were determined as shown in Figure 12, K<sub>m (\u03a1\u03b3\u03bf)</sub> and E<sub>t</sub> values were determined as shown in Figure 10. Kj value for HF was determined from the slope of IC<sub>50</sub> vs. [Pro]/K<sub>m (</sub>p<sub>ro)</sub> by linear regression using Prism Graphpad software. Standard error is shown. </p>[0074] Figure 12 shows IC<sub>50</sub> for HF inhibition of ProRS activity at different proline concentrations. Inhibition of prolyl tRNA synthetase activity was determined with triplicate determinations at the indicated concentrations of proline, and 1 nM (no inhibition compared to 0 nM, used for purposes of log plot), 40 nM, 80 nM, 160 nM, 240 nM, 320 nM, and 480 nM concentrations of HF. Curves were fit by nonlinear regression using the equation Y=100/(l+10<sup>A</sup>(([HF]-LogIC50))) where Y is reaction velocity normalized as percentage to the uninhibited reaction. </p> [0075] Figure 13 shows that HFol inhibits ProRS activity. ProRS activity was measured as in Figures 10 and 11 at a concentration of 100 \u03bc\u039c Pro. </p> [0076] Figure 14 shows that reduction of EPRS levels sensitizes cells for induction of AAR genes by halofuginone. siRNA depletion, HF treatment, and gene expression analysis were done as described for Figure 2C. </p> [0077] Figure 15 shows that proline rescues GCN2 dependent induction of eIF2a phosphorylation by halofuginone. eIF2a phosphorylation was stimulated as in Figure 5A. </p>[0078] Figure 16 shows that halofuginone does not directly inhibit downstream targets of the mTORCl pathway in fibroblasts. MEFs growing in DME/10% FCS were treated with 100 nM HF or 0.5 \u03bc\u039c rapamycin and analyzed by Western blot for phosphorylation of component of the mTor signaling pathway. \n\n [0079] Figure 17 shows that incubation with proline does not change intracellular accumulation of halofuginone. MEFs were incubated with the indicated concentration of HF in the presence or absence of 2 mM proline for 2 hours, washed twice in cold PBS, and lysed in 1% NP40. Lysates were then tested for HF levels in comparison to a standard curve using known concentrations of HF with an anti-HF antibody based ELISA assay (see Examples). Error bars reflect standard deviation of triplicate determinations. Similar results were obtained in three separate experiments. <"
