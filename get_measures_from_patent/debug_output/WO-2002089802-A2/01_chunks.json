    "cted from the group consisting of neurokinin- 1 (NKi), neurokinin-2 (NK<sub>2</sub>) and neurokinin-3 (NK<sub>3</sub>) receptors. In one aspect of the invention, NKi selective antagonists are utilized in the methods of the invention. In another aspect of the invention, NK<sub>2</sub> selective antagonists are utilized in the methods of the invention. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the compounds antagonize two or more of the NKi, NK<sub>2</sub> and NK<sub>3</sub> receptors. . In more preferred embodiments of the invention, compounds non-selectively antagonize all three of the NKi, NK<sub>2</sub> and NK<sub>3</sub> receptors.</p>The compounds of the inventive method can be used to affect androgen production in a mammal (e.g., humans, dogs, cats, etc.). They can be administered to cause a chemical castration in a mammal (both male and female). Thus, male dogs can be neutered and female cats can be spayed with the inventive method. The inventive method can also be used to treat patients desiring prophylactic androgen modulation.</p>The in vitro and in vivo NKi, NK<sub>2</sub> and NK<sub>3</sub> activities of the compounds having formula 1 or 2 can be determined by various procedures known in the art, such as a test for their ability to inhibit the activity of the NKi agonist Substance P, an isolated hamster trachea NK<sub>2</sub> assay, measurement of NK<sub>2</sub> activity in vivo in guinea pigs, measurement of bronchoconstriction due to NKA and neurokinin receptor binding assay(s). Typical procedures are described in WO 96/34857. Procedures for determining NK<sub>3</sub> activity may be found in, for example, Molecular Pharmacol., 48 (1995), p. 711-716. \n\n The percent inhibition of neurokinin agonist activity is the difference between the percent of maximum specific binding (\"MSB\") and 100%. The percent of MSB is defined by the following equation, wherein \"dpm\" represents \"disintegrations per minute\":</p>V M9R = <sup>dpm of unknown</sup>) \" (<sup>d m of</sup> nonspecific binding) (dpm of total binding) - (dpm of nonspecific binding)</p>The concentration at which a compound having formula 1 or 2 produces 50% inhibition of binding is then used to determine an inhibition constant (\"Ki\") using the Chang-Prusoff equation.</p>It will be recognized that the compounds having formula 1 or 2 can exhibit</p>NK-i, NK<sub>2</sub> and NK<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist activities of varying degrees. For instance, certain compounds can exhibit strong \n<img id=\"imgf000026_0001\" path=\"imgf000026_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/2737962/WO/20021114/A2/002002/08/98/02/imgf000026_0001.tif\"/>\n antagonist activity, but weaker NK<sub>2</sub> and NK<sub>3</sub> antagonist activity, while other compounds may be strong NK<sub>2</sub> antagonists, but weaker NKi and NK<sub>3</sub> antagonists.</p>The compounds useful for practice of the invention exhibit potent affinities for one or more of the NK-i, NK<sub>2</sub> and NK<sub>3</sub> receptors as measured by Ki values (in nM). The activities (potencies) for these compounds are determined by measuring their Ki values. The smaller the Ki value, the more active is a compound for antagonizing a particular NK receptor. Suitable compounds for use in the invention may exhibit a wide range of activities. The average Ki values for the NK-i, NK<sub>2</sub> and NK<sub>3</sub> receptors of compounds for use with the invention generally range from &gt; 0 nM (e.g., 0.0 nM) to about 1000 nM, preferably, from about 0.05 nM to about 500 nM, with values of from about 0.1 nM to about 100 nM being more preferred.</p>BIOLOGICAL DATA</p>The androgen-suppressing effect of compounds which are antagonists of one or more of NK-i, NK<sub>2</sub>, and NK<sub>3</sub> receptors have been determined as follows: The compounds in Table I below were evaluated: \n\n TABLE I</p><img id=\"imgf000027_0001\" path=\"imgf000027_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/2737980/WO/20021114/A2/002002/08/98/02/imgf000027_0001.tif\"/></p>REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM EFFECTS IN DOGS</p>Compound A was administered as an aqueous solution in sterile water by daily oral gavage to adult healthy beagle dogs.</p>The dogs received 28 consecutive daily doses at dose levels of 0, 15, 30 or 60 mg/kg. All dogs survived the treatment period. Compound A-related organ \n\nweight and histopathologic changes were observed in both males and females, in the testes, epididymides, prostate gland, ovaries, and uterus. Organ weights of male and female reproductive tract tissues were 33-86% lower than that of concurrent controls, and occurred in all dose groups. Microscopically, atrophy of seminiferous tubules (severe) in the testes, epididymides (minimal to moderate) and prostate gland (mild to moderate) was observed in all dose groups in males."
