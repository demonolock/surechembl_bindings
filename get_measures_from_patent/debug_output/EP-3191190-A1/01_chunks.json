    "r 5 minutes in water, their wet combability was determined (reference value).</p>\u00a0For the dyeings, 12 strands of natural European hair (IHIP (New York), lot # 03/2012, N121, length 15 cm, weight 1 g) were used per oxidative dye. For this purpose, in each case 4 g of the previously prepared oxidative brightener per 1 g of hair strand were applied. After streaks were dyed at 32 \u00b0 C for 30 minutes, they were rinsed with water for 2 minutes and air dried.</p>The measurement of wet combability was carried out as follows:</p>\u00a0Before the measurement, each tress was moistened with combing with a hard rubber crest with fine teeth (Hercules S\u00e4gemann, Hamburg Germany) for 2 seconds with water. After 3 combing operations have been performed, the combing force is measured during a further 10 combing operations, whereby the respective hair strand rotates slowly during the combing process. The resulting measurements are compared using the following statistical tests embedded in Statistica 10.0 software (StatSoft Inc., USA):</p>\u00a0Shapiro-Wilks test (test for normal distribution)</p>\u00a0Outlier test after Grubbs</p>Bartlett test (test for homoscedasticity of variances)  Univariant significance test</p>\u00a0Newman-Keuls test (determination of significant differences)</p>\u00a0Unequal N HSD test (multi-comparison test).</p>The change in the combing force dK in percent can be calculated using the formula dK = [(Ko-K) / Ko] * 100. Ko here is the average of the combing power for the undyed strands of hair and Ki is the mean value for the hair strands treated with the respective oxidative brightener.</p>The care of the strands of hair is the higher, the lower the combing force applied and thus the higher the change in the combing force. Table 2 shows the dK values for the colorations using the cosmetic agents V1, E1 and E2. The colorations with the cosmetic products E1 and E2 according to the invention, which contain at least one particular aminated silicone polymer in a total amount of 0.97% by weight and 1.9% by weight, respectively, show in comparison to the colorations without aminated silicone polymer (V1 ) a higher change in the combing force and thus increased care. </p>\u00a03. Improved whitening performance by adding at least one special aminated silicone polymer</p>For the lightening process, 4 times the amount of oxidative lightening agent prepared under point 2 was applied to strands of dark blond, light brown and dark brown hair (codes: Kerling 6/0, Fischbach &amp; Miller 6923) of about 0.7 g weight. After the strands were bleached for 45 min at 32 \u00b0 C, they were washed with a commercial shampoo and dried with a hair dryer.</p>All tresses were measured with a colorimeter from Datacolor, type Spectraflash 450. The value dL used for the evaluation of the brightening power results from the L * a * b color measurement values measured at the respective tress as follows:</p></p>\u00a0In this case, Lo is in each case the mean value of the color measurement values of the untreated hair "
