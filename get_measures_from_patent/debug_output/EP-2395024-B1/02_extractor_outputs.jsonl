{"raw_mentions": "None of the sentences in the provided text snippet contain all four required components: a specific molecule name, ID, or other identifier, a bioactivity metric (IC50, Ki, Kd, EC50, and their variations), a specific numeric value for that metric, and a unit for that value. \n\nHowever, one sentence mentions an EC50 value but lacks a specific numeric value and unit:\n\"The data show that all Abs show a similar EC50 value, but the B-HH1 construct binds with a lower intensity/stoichiometry than the the variants B-HH2 and B-HH3.\"\n\nSince this sentence does not meet all the criteria, it should not be included according to the instructions. Therefore, there are no sentences to return based on the given criteria."}
