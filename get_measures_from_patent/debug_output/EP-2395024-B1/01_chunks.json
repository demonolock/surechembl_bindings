    "manized anti-CD20 antibodies to Raji B-cells. The differences between the B-HH2 construct and the B-HL8 and B-HL11 constructs are located in the framework 1 and 2 regions with all three CDRs being identical. B-HL8 and B-HL11 have their FR1 andFR2 sequences derived from the human VH3 class, whereas the complete B-HH2 framework is human VH1 derived. B-HL11 is a derivative of B-HL8 with the single mutation Glu1 Gln, with Gln being the amino acid residue in the B-HR2 construct. This means that the Glu1 Gln exchange does not alter binding affinity or intensity. The other differences between B-HH2 and B-HL8 are 14 FR residues, from which one or more will influence the antigen binding behavior of this antibody.FIG 10. Binding of the humanized anti-CD20 antibody BHL4-BKV1 on Raji target cells. The B-HL4 construct is derived from the B-HH2 antibody by replacing the FR1 of the B-HH2 with that of the human germ line sequence IGHV1-45 (Acc No X92209). This construct shows greatly diminished antigen binding capacity, despite having different amino acids at only four positions within FR1. These residues are located at positions 2,14,28 and 30 according to Kabat numbering. Of these, positions 28, and 30 appear to be influential positions, since they are part of the Chothia definition of CDR1.FIG 11. Comparison of the binding behavior between B-HH1, B-HH2, B-HH3 (all paired with the BKV1 humanized B-lyl light chain), and the parental antibody B-ly1. The data show that all Abs show a similar EC50 value, but the B-HH1 construct binds with a lower intensity/stoichiometry than the the variants B-HH2 and B-HH3. B-HH1 can be distinguished from B-HH2 and B-HH3 by its partially human CDR1 and CDR2 regions (Kabat definition), as well as the Ala/Thr polymorphism at position 28 (Kabat numbering). This indicates that either position 28, the complete CDR1, and/or the complete CDR2 is important for antibody/antigen interaction.FIG 12. Comparison of the binding behavior between B-HL1, B-HH1, and the B-ly1 parental antibody. The data showed absence of any binding activity in the B-HL1 construct, and about half of the binding intensity /stoichiometry of B-HH1 compared to B-lyl. Both B-HL1, as well as B-HH1, are designed based on acceptor frameworks derived from the human VH1 class. Among other differences, position 71 (Kabat numbering) of the B-HL1 construct is a striking difference, indicating its putative importance for antigen binding.FIG 13. Comparison of the binding behavior between the anti-CD20 antibody heavy chain construct B-HL2, and B-HL3 to its antigen. In both cases the murine VL sequence was combined with the humanized heavy chains The data showed that the B-HL2 and B-HL3 constructs do not display CD-20 binding activity.FIG 14.
