The term \"microbe\" is further meant to include a fungus selected from the group comprising: Cryptococcus neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides immitis, Blastomyces dermatidis, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Candida albicans. \n\n A \"pharmaceutically effective amount\" refers to an appropriate amount to obtain a therapeutic effect. Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining The Ld50 (The Dose Lethal To 50% Of The Population) And The Ed50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compounds which exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. The effective amount may vary within a range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture.</p>\"Pharmaceutical effective carrier\" refers to a physiologically acceptable carriers or excipient. Thus, the compounds and their physiologically acceptable salts and solvates may be formulated for administration by, for example, injection, inhalation or insufflation (either through the mouth or the nose) or oral, buccal, parenteral or rectal administration. For therapy, the compounds of the invention can be formulated for a variety of loads of administration, including systemic and topical or localized administration. Techniques and formulations generally may be found in Remmington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Meade Publishing Co., Easton, PA. For systemic administration, injection is preferred, including intramuscular, intravenous, intraperitoneal, and subcutaneous. For injection, the compounds of the invention can be formulated in liquid solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hank's solution or Ringer's solution. In addition, the compounds may be formulated in solid form and redissolved or suspended immediately prior to use. Lyophilized forms are also included. For oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions may take the form of, for example, tablets or capsules prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as binding agents (e.g., pregelatinised maize starch, polyvinylp",
    "d encoding such peptides. In addition, fragments can be chemically synthesized using techniques known in the art such as conventional Merrifield solid phase f-Moc or t-Boc chemistry. For example, a tolerance gene polypeptide of the present invention may be arbitrarily divided into fragments of desired length with no overlap of the fragments, or preferably divided into overlapping fragments of a desired length. The fragments can be produced (recombinantly or by chemical synthesis) and tested to identify those peptidyl fragments which can function as either agonists or antagonists of a wild-type (e.g., \"authentic\") tolerance gene protein.</p>Another aspect of the present invention concerns recombinant forms of the tolerance gene proteins. Recombinant polypeptides preferred by the present invention, in addition to native tolerance gene proteins, are at least 92% homologous and more preferably 94% homologous and most preferably 95% homologous with an amino acid sequence of a tolerance gene protein. Polypeptides which are at least about 98-99% homologous with a tolerance gene sequence is also within the scope of the invention. In a preferred embodiment, a tolerance gene protein of the present invention is a tolerance gene protein, hi particularly preferred embodiments, a tolerance gene protein has a tolerance gene bioactivity. In certain preferred embodiments, the invention features a purified or recombinant tolerance gene polypeptide having a molecular weight of approximately 17 kD. It will be understood that certain post-translational modifications, e.g., phosphorylation and the like, can increase the apparent molecular weight of the tolerance gene protein relative to the unmodified polypeptide chain.</p>The present invention further pertains to recombinant forms of one of the subject tolerance gene polypeptides which are encoded by genes derived from a mammalian organism, and which have amino acid sequences evolutionarily related to a tolerance gene protein. Such recombinant tolerance gene polypeptides preferably are capable of functioning in one of either role of an agonist or antagonist of at least one biological activity of a wild-type (\"authentic\") \n\ntolerance gene protein of the appended sequence listing. The term \"evolutionarily related to\", with respect to amino acid sequences of tolerance gene proteins, refers to both polypeptides having amino acid sequences which have arisen naturally, and also to mutational variants of tolerance gene polypeptides which are derived, for example, by combinatorial mutagenesis. Such evolutionarily derived tolerance gene polypeptides preferred by the present invention have a tolerance gene bioactivity and are at least 92% homologous and more preferably 94% homologous and most preferably 98-99% homologous to a tolerance gene protein. In a particularly preferred embodiment, a tolerance gene protein comprises the amino acid coding sequence of sarA.</p>In general, polypeptides referred to herein as having an activ"
