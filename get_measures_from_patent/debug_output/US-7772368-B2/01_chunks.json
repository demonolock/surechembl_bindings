    "ion can provide an experimental model for the development of an anti-allergy drug. That is, the inducer of the present invention can be effectively used for the development and test of an anti-allergy drug requiring huge amount of allergens.</p>The present invention also provides a method for screening a drug inhibiting HRF-mediated allergy comprising contacting a drug candidate with the recombinant deletion form of HRF or the HRF homo- or hetero-dimer of the present invention and determining whether the drug candidate binds the recombinant deletion form of HRF or the HRF homo- or hetero-dimer.</p>The recombinant deletion forms of HRF or the HRF homo- or hetero-dimers of the invention can provide a binding site for HRF-binding peptides, so that they can be used for the development of an anti-allergy drug effective by inhibiting HRF activity. Affinity was investigated by using HBP2 peptide (Korean Registered Patent No: 457350). As a result, deletion forms of HRF having amino acid sequences each represented by SEQ ID NO:5 and NO:8 were proved to have excellent affinities to the peptide (see FIG. 9). Therefore, HRF peptide having the amino acid sequence can be used for detecting a substance of a compound binding to HRF peptide, making the substance and the compound as a useful candidate for an anti-allergy drug.</p>The recombinant deletion forms of HRF are isolated from cells transfected with recombinant vectors containing genes encoding the deletion forms of HRF by competitive binding assay, which will be reacted with test drugs and other factors known to interact with deletion forms of HRF [for example, HRF-binding peptide (Korean Registered Patent No. 457350B1)]. Among those test drugs, a drug reducing interaction between deletion forms of HRF and HRF-binding peptide is selected. At last, a drug which has a similar structure to HRF-binding peptide and inhibits HRF-induced histamine secretion in cells is screened.</p>The present invention also provides a method for detecting HRF in serum of a patient comprising preparing serum from the patient; detecting level of HRF by an immunoassay using the recombinant deletion form of HRF or the HRF homo- or heterodimer of the present invention and an antibody thereof.</p>The antibody comprises a polyclonal antibody or a monoclonal antibody, but the monoclonal antibody is prefered. A monoclonal antibody specific for the recombinant deletion forms of HRF or the HRF homo- or hetero-dimer can be prepared by the conventional art by using the recombinant deletion forms of HRF. The produced antibody specific for the recombinant deletion form of HRF can be included in the scope of the present invention.</p>A method for detecting HRF in serum of an allergy patient is described in detail hereafter. The HRF-binding peptide or the antibody specific for the deletion form of HRF is coated on bottom, which will be reacted with blood sample. Then, the antibody specific for the deletion form of HRF or the HRF homo- or hetero"
