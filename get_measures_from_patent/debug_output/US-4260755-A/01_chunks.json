    "ethoxymethyl)-6-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-b]pyridazine</p>BRAIN-SPECIFIC BENZODIAZEPINE RECEPTOR BINDING ASSAYAnother test utilized for the determination of anxiolytic activity is the measurement of the ability of test compounds to inhibit the binding of tritiated benzodiazepines to brain-specific receptors of warm-blooded animals. A modification of the method described by R. F. Squires et al. Nature, 266, No. 21, pg. 732, (April, 1977) and H. Mohler et al. Science, 198, pg. 849, (1977) was employed.</p>Male albino rats (Wistar strain, weighing 150-200 g. each) were obtained from Royalhart Farms. <sup>3</sup> H-Methyl-diazepam (79.9 Ci/mmol) and <sup>3</sup> H-methylflunitrazepam (84.3 Ci/mmol) were obtained from New England Nuclear. The test compounds were solubilized in either dimethylformamide, acetic acid, ethanol or hydrochloric acid.</p>Whole cortex of rats was homogenized gently in 20 volumes of ice-cold 0.32 M. sucrose, centrifuged twice at 1000 g for 10 minutes and then recentrifuged at 30,000 g for 20 minutes to produce a crude P<sub>2</sub> -synaptosomal fraction. The P<sub>2</sub> -fraction was either: (1) resuspended in twice the original volume in hypotonic 50 mM. Tris.HCl (pH 7.4), or (2) resuspended in one-half the original volume in hypotonic 10 mM. Tris.HCl (pH 7.4) and frozen (-20\u00b0 C.) until time of use. Frozen P<sub>2</sub> preparations were thawed and resuspended in four times the original homogenizing volume at time of assay.</p>The binding assay consisted of 300 \u03bcl. of the P<sub>2</sub> -fraction suspension (0.2-0.4 mg. protein), 100 \u03bcl. of test drug and 100 \u03bcl. of <sup>3</sup> H-diazepam (1.5 nM., final concentration) of <sup>3</sup> H-flunitrazepam (1.0 nM., final concentration) which was added to 1.5 ml. of 50 mM. Tris.HCl (pH 7.4). Non-specific binding controls and total binding controls received 100 \u03bcl. of diazepam (3 \u03bcM. final concentration) and 100 \u03bcl. of deionized water, respectively, in place of the test compound. Incubation for 30 minutes proceeded in ice and was terminated by filtration, under vacuum, through Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters. The filters were washed twice with 5 ml. of ice-cold 50 mM. Tris.HCl (pH 7.4) and placed in scintillation vials. After drying at 50\u00b0-60\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes, 10 ml. of Beckman Ready-Solve HP was added and the radioactivity determined in a Beckman Scintillation Counter.</p>Compounds which exhibited the ability to inhibit <sup>3</sup> H-benzodiazepine binding by \u226720% were considered to be active. Inhibition of binding was calculated by the difference between total binding and binding in the presence of test compound, divided by the total binding, X 100.</p>Representative compounds of the present invention which are active when tested by the <sup>3</sup> H-benzodiazepine binding assay are:</p>3-(Chloromethyl)-6-phenyl-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a]pyridazine</p>3-(Chloromethyl)-6-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-b]pyridazine</p>The compounds of the present invention may be administered to warm-blooded animals orally or parenterally, if desired and when so administered, may be considered as tranquilizing agents for therapeutically desirable treatment of anxiety in warm-blooded animals.</p>The dosage regimen can be adjusted to provide optimum therapeutic response. Thus, for example, several doses may be administered daily, or the dose may be reduced proportionately as indicated by the requirements of the particular therapeutic situation.</p>For therapeutic administration, the compounds of this invention may be incorporated with pharmaceutical carriers such as excipients and used, for example, in the form of tablets, troches, dragees, capsules, suspensions, emulsions, liquids, syrups, wafers, chewing gum or the like for oral administration.</p>Parenteral solutions and suspensions may be prepared for intramuscular or subcutaneous administration, and suppositories may be prepared for rectal administration. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1% of active component. The percentage in the compositions and preparations may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between 2% to about 75% or more of the weight of the unit. The amount of anxiolytic active component in such therapeutically useful compositions or prepara"
