To a solution of 4-acetamidobenzaldehyde (10 g, 61.3 mmol) in methanol (100 mL) was added sodium borohydride (800 mg) at room temperature in portions. The reaction mixture was stirred over night, and the progress of reaction checked by TLC using 4:1 hexanes:EtOAc as eluent. Absence of starting material indicated the completion of reduction and the reaction mixture was concentrated in a rotavap. The residue was partitioned between water (25 mL) and ethyl acetate (4\u00d750 mL) and the organic layer was washed with brine (25 mL). The ethyl acetate layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and the removal of the solvent gave the alcohol as a pale yellow solid, which was dried under high vacuum. 8.6 g (85%); <sup>1</sup>H NMR (DMSO-d<sub>6</sub>): \u03b4 2.0 (s, 3H), 4.5 (d, 2H), 5.2 (t, 1H), 7.25 (d, 2H), 7.55 (d, 2H), 9.95 (s, 1H) ppm.</p>Preparation of 4-acetamidobenzyl iodide. To a cooled solution of anhyd. DMF (5 mL) was added thionyl chloride (0.2 mL, 2.8 mmol). The mixture was stirred for 10 min and a solution of KI (2.49 g, 15 mmol) in anhyd. DMF (12 mL) was added followed by the addition of the alcohol prepared above (0.165 g, 1 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred in the ice-bath for 3 h and allowed to stir at r.t. overnight. The reaction mixture was poured into ice-water (25 mL) and extracted with ether (3\u00d725 mL). The ether layer was washed with brine, dried over anhyd. sodium sulfate and concentrated to remove the solvent. The product was obtained (138 mg, 50%) as a clean yellow solid.
