    " transcription of a nucleic acid. An expression control sequence can be a promoter, such as a constitutive or an inducible promoter, or an enhancer. The expression control sequence is operably linked to the nucleic acid sequence to be transcribed. </p> As used herein, \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable carrier\u201d includes any material which, when combined with an active ingredient, allows the ingredient to retain biological activity and is non-reactive with the subject's immune system. Examples include, but are not limited to, any of the standard pharmaceutical carriers such as a phosphate buffered saline solution, water, emulsions such as oil/water emulsion, and various types of wetting agents. Preferred diluents for aerosol or parenteral administration are phosphate buffered saline or normal (0.9%) saline. Compositions comprising such carriers are formulated by well known conventional methods (see, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th edition, A.

    "ity was immobilizing of 9TL on CM5 chip and measuring binding kinetics of A\u03b2<sub>1-40 </sub>peptide to the antibody. CM5 chips were activated with N-ethyl-N\u2032-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Antibody 9TL or its variants was diluted into 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4.0 or 5.0 and injected over the activated chip at a concentration of 0.005 mg/mL. Using variable flow time across the individual chip channels, a range of antibody density was achieved: 1000-2000 or 2000-3000 response units (RU). The chip was blocked with ethanolamine. Regeneration studies showed that a solution containing 2 volumes of PIERCE elution buffer and 1 volumes of 4 M NaCl effectively removed the bound A\u03b2<sub>1-40 </sub>peptide while keeping the activity of 9TL on the chip for over 200 injections. HBS-EP buffer (0.01M HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% Surfactant P20) was used as running buffer for all the BIAcore assays. Serial dilutions (0.1-10\u00d7 estimated K<sub>D</sub>) of purified A\u03b2<sub>1-40 </sub>synthetic peptide samples were injected for 1 min at 100 \u03bcL/min and dissociation times of 10 min were allowed. Kinetic association rates (k<sub>on</sub>) and dissociation rates (k<sub>off</sub>) were obtained simultaneously by fitting the data to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model (Karlsson, R. Roos, H. Fagerstam, L. Petersson, B. (1994). Methods Enzymology 6.99-110) using the BIAevaluation program. Equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) values were calculated as k<sub>off/on</sub>. </p> Alternatively, affinity was determined by immobilizing A\u03b2<sub>1-40 </sub>peptide on SA chip and measuring binding kinetics of 9TL Fab and Fab of 9TL variants to the immobilized A\u03b2<sub>1-40 </sub>peptide. Affinities of 9TL Fab fragment and its variants Fab fragments were determined by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) system (BIAcore 3000\u2122, BIAcore, Inc., Piscaway, N.J.). SA chips (streptavidin) were used according to the supplier's instructions. Biotinylated A\u03b2 peptide 1-40 was diluted into HBS-EP (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% P20) and injected over the chip at a concentration of 0.005 mg/mL. Using variable flow time across the individual chip channels, two ranges of antigen density were achieved: 10-200 response units (RU) for detailed kinetic studies and 500-600 RU for concentration studies and screening. Regeneration studies showed that 100 mM phosphoric acid (may also be followed by a solution containing 2 volumes of 50 mM NaOH and 1 volume of 70% ethanol) effectively removed the bound Fab while keeping the activity of A\u03b2 peptide on the chip for over 200 injections. HBS-EP buffer was used as running buffer for all the BIAcore assays. Serial dilutions (0.1-10\u00d7 estimated K<sub>D</sub>) of purified Fab samples were injected for 2 min at 100 \u03bcL/min and dissociation times of 10 min were allowed. The concentrations of the Fab proteins were determined by ELISA and/or SDS-PAGE electrophoresis using a standard Fab of known concentration (determined by amino acid analysis). Kinetic association rates (k<sub>on</sub>) and dissociation rates (k<sub>off</sub>) were obtained simultaneously by fitting the data to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model (Karlsson, R. Roos, H. Fagerstam, L. Petersson, B. (1994). Methods Enzymology 6.99-110) using the BIAevaluation program. Equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) values were calculated as k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>. </p> B.
