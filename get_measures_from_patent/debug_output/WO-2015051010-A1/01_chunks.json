    "in-protein interactions. In general, four types of binding interactions exist between antigens and antibodies: (i) hydrogen bonds, (ii) dispersion forces, (iii) electrostatic forces between Lewis acids and Lewis bases, and (iv) hydrophobic interactions. Hydrophobic interactions are a major driving force for the antibody-antigen interaction, and are based on repulsion of water by non-polar groups rather than attraction of molecules (Tanford, 1978). However, certain physical forces also contribute to antigen-antibody binding, for example, the fit or complimentary of epitope shapes with different antibody binding sites. Moreover, other materials and antigens may cross- react with an antibody, thereby competing for available free antibody. </p>Measurement of the affinity constant and specificity of binding between antigen and antibody is a pivotal element in determining the efficacy of prophylactic, therapeutic, diagnostic and research methods using the antibodies of the invention. \"Binding affinity\" generally refers to the strength of the sum total of the noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a \n\n molecule (e.g., an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g. , an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, \"binding affinity\" refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1 : 1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., antibody and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd), which is calculated as the ratio k<sub>0</sub>ff/k<sub>on</sub>. See, e.g., Chen, Y., et al. , (1 999) J. Mol Biol 293:865-881 . Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art, including those described and exemplified herein. An example of a commercially available system for kinetic characterization includes the OCTET\u00ae family of instruments. Low-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to dissociate readily, whereas high-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain bound longer. A variety of methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art, any of which can be used for purposes of the present invention. </p>Determination of binding affinity can be measured using the specific techniques described further in the Example section, and methods well known in the art. One such method includes measuring the disassociation constant \"Kd\" by a radiolabeled antigen binding assay (RIA) performed with the Fab version of an antibody of interest and its antigen as described by the following assay that measures solution binding affinity of Fabs for antigen by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of (<sup>125</sup>l)-labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen, then capturing bound antigen with an anti-Fab antibody-coated plate (Chen, et al., (1 999) J. Mol Biol 293:865-881 ). To establish conditions for the assay, microtiter plates (Dynex) are coated overnight with 5 \u03bcg/ml of a capturing anti-Fab antibody (Cappel Labs) in 50 mM sodium carbonate (H 9.6), and subsequently blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature (approximately 23 \u00b0 C). In a non-adsorbant plate (Nunc #269620), 1 00 pM or 26 pM [<sup>125</sup>l]-antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest (e.g., consistent with assessment of an anti-VEGF antibody, Fab-1 2, in Presta et al., (1 997) Cancer Res. 57:4593-4599). The Fab of interest is then incubated \n\n overnight; however, the incubation may continue for a longer period (e.g., 65 hours) to insure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter, the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature (e.g., for one hour). The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1 % Tween-20 in PBS. When the plates have dried, 150 \u03bc\u0399/well of scintillant (MicroScint-20; Packard) is added, and the plates are counted on a Topcount gamma counter (Packard) for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20% of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays. </p>In another instance the Kd value may be measured by using surface plasmon resonance assays using a BIAcore\u2122-2000 or a BIAcore\u2122-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) at 25\u00b0 C with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at <sup>\"</sup>10 response units (RU). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIAcore Inc.) are activated with N-ethyl-N'-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)- carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Antigen is diluted with 1 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, into 5 ug/ml (<sup>\"</sup>0.2 uM) before injection at a flow rate of 5 ul/minute to achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen, IM ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) at 25\u00b0 C at a flow rate of approximately 25 ul/min. Association rates (k<sub>on</sub>) and dissociation rates (k<sub>off</sub>) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneously fitting the association and dissociation sensorgram. </p>If the on-rate exceeds 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>\"1</sup> S<sup>\"1</sup> by the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation=295 nm; emission=340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25\u00b0 C of a 20 nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of \n\n increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow equipped spectrophometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-Aminco spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stir red cuvette. An \"on-rate\" or \"rate of association\" or \"association rate\" or \"k<sub>on</sub>\" according to this invention can also be determined with the same surface plasmon resonance technique described above using a BIAcore\u2122-2000 or a BIAcore\u2122-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) as described above. </p>Methods and reagents suitable for determination of binding characteristics of an antibody of the present invention, or an altered/mutant derivative thereof (discussed below), are known in the art and/or are commercially available (U.S. Patent Nos. 6,849,425; 6,632,926; 6,294,391 ; 6, 1 43,574). Moreover, equipment and software designed for such kinetic analyses are commercially available (e.g. Biacore\u00ae A1 00, and Biacore\u00ae 2000 instruments; Biacore International AB, Uppsala, Sweden). </p>In one embodiment, antibodies of the present invention, including binding fragments or variants thereof, may also be described or specified in terms of their binding affinity for Influenza A virus polypeptides.

Binding can be detected using standard ELISA or standard Flow Cytometry assays. In a direct binding assay, a candidate antibody is tested for binding to its cognate antigen. Competition-binding assay, on the other hand, assess the ability of a candidate antibody to compete with a known antibody or other compound that binds to the Influenza A virus HA stalk. In general any method that permits \n\n the binding of an antibody with the Influenza A virus HA stalk that can be detected is encompassed with the scope of the present invention for detecting and measuring the binding characteristics of the antibodies. One of skill in the art will recognize these well-known methods and for this reason are not provided in detail here. These methods are also utilized to screen a panel of antibodies for those providing the desired characteristics. </p>An antibody of the invention immunospecifically binds to Influenza A virus HA stalk and is capable of neutralizing Influenza A virus infection. Neutralization assays can be performed as described herein in the Examples section or using other methods known in the art. The term \"inhibitory concentration 50%\" (abbreviated as \"IC<sub>5</sub>o\") represents the concentration of an inhibitor (e.g., an antibody of the invention) that is required for 50% neutralization of Influenza A virus. It will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that a lower IC<sub>5</sub>o value corresponds to a more potent inhibitor. </p>In one embodiment, an antibody or binding fragment thereof according to the invention has a neutralizing potency expressed as 50% inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>5</sub>o ug/ml) in the range of from about 0.01 ug/ml",

IgG) that was initiated at various time points (1 , 2, 3 or 4 days post infection). Figure 1 3 shows the percentage of surviving animals in each group in a study that mice were infected with a lethal dose of H3 influenza virus and treated with Antibody 12 at 2.5 mg/kg or 0.3 mg/kg single dose, oseltamivir at 25mg/kg BID for 5 days, or a combination of Antibody 12 at 2.5 mg/kg or 0.3 mg/kg and oseltamivir at 25mg/kg BID for 5 days at 2 days post infection. </p>Figure 14 shows the percentage of surviving ferrets in each group of a study after infection with a lethal dose of H5N1 influenza virus and treatment with \n\n25mg/kg single dose Antibody 12, 25mg/kg BID oseltamivir for 5 days, or a non-relevant control antibody (Ctrl. IgG) at 1 , 2, or 3 days post infection. </p>Figure 15 shows an alignment of HA2 Protein of Influenza A Strains Used in MARM selection. </p>Examples </p>Example 1. Construction and optimization of human monoclonal antibodies isolated from memory B cells </p>The CD22+ lgG+ B cells were sorted from cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of a donor selected for high titers of heterosubtypic antibodies and immortalized at 3 cells/well using Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) and CpG oligodeoxynucleotide 2006 and feeder cells. Culture supernatants containing antibodies were harvested after 14 days and screened by ELISA binding assay to determine the binding activity against H5 (A/Vietnam/1203/04) and H7 (A/NLD/03) hemagglutinin (HA), respectively. Four B cell clones (Antibody 1 , Antibody 4, Antibody 7, and Antibody 9) were found to bind specifically to both HAs and were therefore collected. The VH and VL genes of these clones were sequenced and found to be clonally related according to the homology analysis performed on VH and VL V, D and J fragments using the Kabat database. Of note, the VH of Antibody 4 was found to have a degenerate nucleotide site in the HCDR3 encoding for either valine (encoded in Antibody 5) or glutamate (encoded in Antibody 6). The VH and VL genes of the four antibodies were cloned into lgG1 expression vectors (minor sequence modifications to facilitate cloning and or codon optimization resulted in the five antibodies; Antibody 3, Antibody 5, Antibody 6, Antibody 8 and Antibody 10; used in the following Examples) and recombinant antibodies were produced by transient transfection of mammalian cell lines derived from HEK or CHO cells. Supernatants from transfected cells were collected after 7-10 days of culture, and IgGs were affinity purified by Protein A \n\n chromatography, and dialyzed into PBS. Antibody 3 was further optimized to create variants in which non-germline encoded somatic mutations located in the framework regions were changed to the germline encoded amino acid, and the CDR regions were subjected to parsimonious mutagenesis. Full IgG constructs containing different mutations were expressed as described above and the crude supernatants were screened by ELISA to select clones that had increased binding activity to H3 and H 1 HA proteins. ELISA was performed using a coating concentration of 0.15 \u03bcg/ml of rabbit anti-human IgG in order to capture and normalize IgG from the supernatants, and then 0.5 \u03bcg/ml of biotinylated HA subtype H1 (A/California/7/04 (H1 N1 )) or subtype H3 (A/Perth/16/09 (H3N2)) was added and incubated for one hour. Binding was detected by the addition of streptavidin-HRP (1 :5000), and development absorbance was read at 450 nm. The beneficial single mutations conferring better binding were combined and cloned into a combinatorial library, which were expressed and screened by ELISA as described above. This library approach resulted in the creation of 5 additional Antibody 3 variants that were further characterized (Antibodies 1 1 -15). </p>Example 2. Anti-HA neutralizing antibody (nAb) binds to HA of different subtypes </p>To test if the epitope of the anti-HA antibodies is conserved among HAs of different subtypes, a HA cross-reactivity ELISA binding assay was performed. A 384-well Maxisorb ELISA plate (Nunc) was coated overnight at 4\u00b0C with 0.5 ug/ml recombinant HA (rHA), subtype H1 (A/California/7/09 (H1 N1 )), subtype H2 (A/Swine/MO/06 (H2N3)), subtype H3 (A/Perth/16/09 (H3N2)), subtype H5 (A/Vietnam/1203/04(H5N1 )), subtype H6 (A/teal/HK/W312/97(H6N1 )), subtype H7 (A/Netherlands/219/03(H7N7)) and subtype H9 ( A/chicken/HK/G9/97(H9N2)) in PBS. The plate was washed with PBS containing 0.1 % v/v Tween-20 to remove uncoated protein and subsequently blocking solution containing 1 %(w/v) casein (Thermo Scientific) was added and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. The blocking solution was \n\n discarded and 3-fold serially diluted anti-HA antibodies in blocking solution (Casein-PBS (Thermo Scientific) were added and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. The plate was washed three times and bound antibodies were detected using a peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-human IgG antibody (Jackson). The binding activity of antibody was calculated by either measuring the chemiluminescent signal after addition of Supersignal Pico substrate (Thermo Scientific) or by measuring the color change at 450 nm after incubation with Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) one component substrate (KPL) followed by the addition of 2N sulfuric acid to stop the reaction. </p>Table 1 </p> Binding to rHA by ELISA (EC<sub>50</sub>, ug/ml) </p> H1 H2 H5 H6 H9 H3 H7</p>A/CA/7 A/swine/ A/VN/120 A/HK/W3 A/HK/G A/Perth/1 A/NLD/2</p>/09 MO/06 3/04 12/97 9/97",

Figure 1 A shows the shift in fluorescence \n\n intensity when antibody is bound to HA expressing cells (white) vs mock- transfected cells (grey) from each of the subtypes. Antibody 3 bound to all HAs tested with the exception of H12, while Antibody 12 bound to all HAs tested from both groups (group 1 H1 1 , H12, H13, H16, and H17 and group 2 H4, H10, H14, and H15) </p>Example 3 Kinetic characterization of the HA binding to Antibody 3 and Antibody 5 lgG1 by using Octet Affinity measurements were performed using a ForteBio Octet QK 384 Kinetic Analyzer (Menlo Park, CA) in 384 slanted-well plates. All reagents were diluted in Octet Kinetics Buffer (ForteBio). His-tagged HA of different subtypes: subtype H1 (A/California/7/04 (H1 N1 )) and subtype H3 (A/Perth/16/09 (H3N2)) were immobilized onto anti-His sensors at 10 \u03bcg/mL. Anti-HA mAb association /dissociation were then monitored in 2-fold dilutions from 100 nM, plus a zero mAb control. </p>Association and dissociation raw data were corrected for any drift in the zero mAb controls, and then exported to GraphPad Prism (San Diego, CA) for affinity curve fitting. Data were fitted using global association/dissociation fitting with an imposed limit of &gt; 5 x1 0<sup>\"6</sup> sec<sup>\"1</sup>. As shown in Table 3, both antibodies have a very high affinity binding to H1 at pM level with a slow dissociation rate under limit of detection. Similar K<sub>on</sub>, K<sub>0</sub>ff and Kd of both antibodies were observed with H3 trimer at sub-nM level. </p>Table 3 </p> Kinetic Binding Analysis of Pan A mAbs on rHA by Octet </p> H 1 A/CA/7/09 H3 A/Perth/1 6/09 \n<img id=\"imgf000093_0001\" path=\"imgf000093_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/297515258/WO/20150409/A1/002015/05/10/10/imgf000093_0001.tif\"/>\n </p> &lt;5 1 1 3.3 62 </p> &lt;5 5 2.6 88 \n\n Example 4 In vitro cross-reactive neutralizing activity of anti-HA IgGI s against virus of different subtypes </p>The microneutralization assay (MNA) was modified from a previously described accelerated viral inhibition assay using neuraminidase activity (NA) as a read-out (Hassantoufighi, A. et al. 201 0, Vaccine 28:790).
