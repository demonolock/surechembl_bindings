{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that contain all four required components: a specific molecule name, ID or other identifier, a bioactivity metric (IC50, Ki, Kd, EC50 and their variations), a specific numeric value for that metric, and a unit for that value. The text appears to be a collection of examples for preparing various cosmetic formulations, but it does not include any bioactivity metrics or their corresponding values and units."}
