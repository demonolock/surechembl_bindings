Drug loading is defined as the weight ratio of drug to microparticles.</p>In Vitro Drug Release</p>Microparticles containing sunitinib (10 mg total weight) were suspended in 4 mL of PBS containing 1% TWEEN\u00ae 20 in a 6-mL glass vial and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. under shaking at 150 rpm. At predetermined time points, 3 mL of the supernatant was withdrawn after particles settled to the bottom of the vial and replaced with 3 mL of fresh release medium. The drug content in the supernatant was determined by UV-Vis spectrophotometry or HPLC.</p>Measurement of Average Size and Size Distribution of Microparticles</p>Several milligrams of the microparticles were first suspended in water and dispersed in an ISOTON\u00ae diluent. The mean particle size and distributions were determined using a COULTER MULTISIZER IV (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, Calif.).</p>Results</p>Both cationic and ionic surfactants, such as Sodium dodecyl sulfate (\u201cSDS\u201d) and Hexadecyltrimethylammonium (\u201cHDTA\u201d), were added to the solvents to make the particles. Loadings were extremely low (0.20% with SDS and 0.27% with HDTA). Substituting a non-ionic solvent such as polyvinyl alcohol (\u201cPVA\u201d) increased loading, up to 1.1%. Sunitinib free base crystallized and could not be utilized to obtain higher loading. Using DMSO increased loading even more so, up to around 5%.</p>TABLE 1Composition and process parameters of sunitinib-encapsulated polymer microparticle formulationsOrganic phasePLGA5050PEG 5 kD(10%SunitinibAqueous phaseEmulsionDragTargetEncap-FormulationPLGAPLGAPEG byDCMmalateDMSOVolumeratloadingloadingsulationID(mg)typewt) (mg)(mL)(mg)(mL)Surfactant(mL)(rpm)(wt %)(wt %)efficierDC-2-55-25607525 4A5.649021% PVA in20050003.113.722.6pH 4 bufferDC-2-55-35607525 4A5.649021% Borate2005000NA13.7NABuffer (pH 10)DC-2-55-45607525 4A5.649021% PVA in H2O20050005.013.736.4(pH 6)DC-2-55-55607525 4A5.649021% PVA in PBS200500011.513.783.8(pH 7.4)DC-2-50-18007525 4A8414521% PVA in PBS200500013.915.291.4DC-2-50-25607525 4A5.6410021% PVA in PBS20050001215.079.9DC-2-50-34007525 4A447021% PVA in PBS20050007.814.852.8DC-2-50-42807525 4A2.845021% PVA in PBS20050006.815.045.3DC-2-50-52007525 4A243521% PVA in PBS20050004.914.833.2DC-1-53-14007525 6E4416021% PVA in PBS200500023.728.483.6DC-1-53-24008515 6E4416021% PVA in PBS200500023.928.484.1DC-1-53-34008515 6A4416021% PVA in PBS200500022.628.479.6JCK--1-72-14005050 2A88021% PVA in H2O20040003.416.720.1YY-1-59-12007525 4A/7525234011% PVA in PBS10040006.816.541.21.5A (1:1)YY-1-83-15547525 4A6416021% PVA in PBS200500020.522.292.2YY-1-83-25047525 4A56416021% PVA in PBS200500020.222.290.7YY-1-93-14007525 4A449021% PVA in PBS200400012.418.268.1YY-1-93-25607525 4A5.649021% PVA in PBS200500011.613.784.5YY-1-96-122407525 4A22.41636081% PVA in PBS800300010.113.773.6JCK-1-26-81007525 6E27511% PVA in PBS100400034.542.980.5</p>Example 2.

    "unctionality, the RGCs conducted action potentials in response to depolarizing current and were responsive to exogenously applied glutamate. To test the role of DLK in vivo in response to axonal injury, mice carrying a foxed allele of Dlk<sup>1 </sup>with capsid-modified adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) expressing the P1 bacteriophage recombinase Cre were intravitreally injected. After sufficient time for Cre-mediated deletion of Dlk, eyes were subjected to optic nerve crush. Compared to either Dlk<sup>+/+</sup> mice injected with AAV2-Cre or Dlk<sup>fl/fl </sup>mice in the absence of Cre, Dlk<sup>fl/fl </sup>mice injected with AAV2-Cre had a 75% reduction in RGC loss (FIGS. 4C and 4D).</p>As DLK appears to be a critical mediator of RGC cell death in vitro and in vivo, the mechanism of DLK regulation was examined. Surprisingly, and unlike other members of the JNK cascade, DLK protein is undetectable in uninjured RGCs both in vitro and in vivo (FIG. 5A). However, after immunopanning in vitro (when RGCs are necessarily axotomized and injured), optic nerve crush, or transection in vivo, there is a robust upregulation of DLK protein). In contrast, Dlk transcript levels remained relatively constant after injury (FIG. 5A), indicating increased translation and/or decreased protein turnover as the mechanism mediating DLK upregulation.</p>To directly test the hypothesis that increased DLK protein can trigger RGC cell death, adenovirus was used to overexpress GFP, DLK or a kinase-dead (KD) version of DLK (K185R). Primary RGCs were infected and survival measured 48 hours later. Consistent with the model, wildtype DLK overexpression hastened cell death, while overexpression of K185R DLK functioned as a dominant-negative, as assessed by INK phosphorylation, and actually increased survival (FIG. 5B).</p>Given that both sunitinib treatment and DLK knockdown promote RGC survival, sunitinib's neuroprotective activity was mediated, at least in part, by DLK pathway inhibition. To assess sunitinib's effect on DLK signaling in RGCs, immunopanned cells were cultured in the presence of increasing amounts of sunitinib. The same concentrations that increase RGC survival caused a decrease in the phosphorylation of targets downstream of DLK, including MKK7 and JNK.</p>SR8165, a sunitinib analog with a widened therapeutic window, reduced DLK toxicity. Nine other compounds reported to bind DLK (axitinib, bosutinib, neratininb, crizotinib, tozasertib, lestautinib, foretinib, TAE-684 and KW-2449) were tested. Except for neratinib and TAE-684, which were limited by toxicity at nanomolar doses, the remaining kinase inhibitors all promoted the survival of primary RGCs in culture, with neuroprotective doses that roughly correlated with their biochemical affinity for purified DLK (FIGS. 6A-6H). To confirm these findings in vivo, intravitreal tozasertib in a slow release formulation was tested, and found that it protected RGCs in both the optic nerve transection and glaucoma models ("
