It is based, at least in part, on the discovery that a soluble CD40/immunoglobulin fusion protein was able to inhibit helper T-cell mediated B-cell activation by binding to a novel 39 kD protein receptor on helper T-cell membranes. The present invention provides for a substantially purified CD40CR receptor; for soluble ligands of CD40CR, including antibodies as well as fusion molecules comprising at least a portion of CD40 protein; and for methods of, controlling B-cell activation which may be especially useful in the treatment of allergy or autoimmune disease. </p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  Studies by Mitchison, Benacerraf and Raff first suggested that physical interactions between T<sub>h </sub>and B-cells were essential in the development of humoral immune responses. Later studies documented that T<sub>h </sub>formed physical conjugates with class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) compatible, antigen-presenting B-cells (Vitetta et al., (1987) Immunol. Rev. 99:193-239) and that it was the B-cells within these conjugates that responded to T<sub>h </sub>(Bartlett et al., (1989) J. Immunol. 143:1745-1754). With the discovery that T<sub>h</sub>-derived lymphokines exerted potent growth and differentiative effects on B-cells, it was proposed that soluble factor(s) released in proximity by activated T<sub>h </sub>mediated the activation of the interacting B-cell. However, none of the molecularly cloned lymphokines, alone or in combination, manifested the ability to induce B-cell cycle entry. Unlike soluble factors, plasma membrane fractions from activated T<sub>h </sub>induced B-cell cycle entry (Hodgkin et al., (1990) J. Immunol. 145:2025-2034; Noelle et al., (1991) J. Immunol. 146:1118-1124). Studies using purified plasma membrane fractions from activated T<sub>h </sub>suggested that a protein expressed on the membrane of activated T<sub>h </sub>was responsible for initiating humoral immunity (Noelle et al., (1991) J. Immunol. 146:1118-1124; Bartlett et al., (1990) J. Immunol. 145:3956-3962). </p> Purified plasma membranes from activated T<sub>h </sub>(PM<sup>Act</sup>) have been used to investigate the nature of this effector function (Hodgkin et al., (1990) J. Immunol. 145:2025-2034: Noelle et al., (1991) J. Immunol. 146:1118-1124). PM<sup>Act </sup>from activated T<sub>h</sub>, but not resting T<sub>h </sub>(PM<sup>rest</sup>) expressed an activity that induced B-cell cycle entry in an antigen-nonspecific, class II-unrestricted manner. In addition, it was shown that the activity expressed by PM<sup>Act </sup>required 4-6 hours of activation, de novo RNA synthesis and was protein in nature (Bartlett et al., (1990) J. Immunol. 145:3956-3962). </p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  The present invention relates to a counter-receptor, termed CD40CR, for the CD40 B-cell antigen, and to soluble ligands for this receptor, including fusion molecules comprising at least a portion of CD40 protein. It is based, at least in part, on the discovery that a soluble CD40/immunoglobulin fusion protein was able to inhibit helper T-cell mediated B-cell activation by binding to a novel 39 kD receptor protein (termed \u201cCD40CR\u201d for CD40 counter-receptor) on helper T-cell membranes, and on the discovery that a monoclonal antibody, termed MR1, directed toward this 39 kD receptor was able to inhibit helper T-cell mediated activation of B-cells. </p> The present invention provides for a substantially purified CD40CR receptor; for soluble ligands of CD40CR, including antibodies as well as fusion molecules comprising at least a portion of CD40 protein; and for methods of controlling B-cell activation. </p> In particular embodiments of the invention, B-cell activation in a subject may be inhibited by contacting helper T cells of the subject with effective amounts of a soluble ligand of CD40CR. Such inhibition of B-cell activation may be especially useful in the treatment of the allergy or autoimmune disease. </p> One advantage of the present invention is that it enables intervention in an aspect of the immune response which is not antigen specific. Many current therapies for allergy include desensitization to particular antigens, and require that each patient be tested in order to identify antigens associated with sensitivity. As a practical matter, exhaustive analysis of a patient's response to each and every potential allergen is virtually impossible. Furthermore, in most autoimmune conditions, the causative antigen is, generally, unknown or even irrelevant to the disease process. The present invention, which relates to the antigen nonspecific CD40/CD40CR interaction, circumvents the need to characterize the antigen associated with allergy or autoimmunity. Therefore, the present invention may be used to particular advantage in the treatment ",
    "ence of PM<sup>Act</sup>, IL4 and IL5, (in the absence of added CD40-Ig) the concentrations of IgM and IgG<sub>1 </sub>were 4.6 \u03bcg/ml and 126 ng/ml, respectively. Cultures which received CD7E-Ig (25 \u03bcg/ml) on Day 0 produced 2.4 \u03bcg/ml and 89 ng/ml of IgM and IgG<sub>1 </sub>respectively. In the absence of IL4 and IL5, no IgM or IgG<sub>1 </sub>was detected. Results are representative of 3 such experiments. </p> Panel B. T<sub>h</sub>1 were rested or activated with anti-CD3 for 16 hours, irradiated and cultured (1\u00d710<sup>4</sup>/well) with resting B-cells (4\u00d710<sup>4</sup>/culture) in the presence of IL4 (10 ng/ml). Between 0 and 25 \u03bcg/ml of CD40-Ig (\u25b4) or CD7E-Ig (\u25cf) were added to cultures. From 66-72 hours post-culture, wells were pulsed with 1.0 \u03bcCi of [<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine and harvested. The dotted line indicates the response of B-cells to resting T<sub>h</sub>. Results presented are the arithmetic mean of triplicate cultures\u00b1s.d., and are representative of 2 such experiments. </p>FIG. 3. CD40-Ig detected a molecule expressed on activated, but not resting T<sub>h</sub>. Resting and activated, T<sub>h </sub>were harvested and incubated with fusion proteins for 20 minutes at 4\u00b0 C., followed by FITC-conjugated goat anti-hIgG (25 \u03bcg/ml). Percentage positive cells and MFI were determined by analysis of at least 5000 cells/sample. Results are representative of 6 such experiments. CD40-Ig binding is indicated by a filled-in profile. </p>FIG. 4. CD40-Ig immunoprecipitated a 39 kD protein from lysate of activated T<sub>h</sub>1. T<sub>h</sub>1 were rested or activated with insolubilized anti-CD3 for 16 hours. [<sup>35</sup>S]-labelled proteins from resting or activated T<sub>h </sub>were immunoprecipitated with purified antibodies or fusion proteins (1-10 \u03bc). The gel profile is representative of 3 such experiments. </p>FIG. 5. A monoclonal antibody (mab), specific to the induced 39 kD T<sub>h </sub>membrane protein, inhibited induction of B-cell RNA synthesis by PM<sup>Act</sup>. Resting B-cells and PM<sup>Act </sup>were cultured with 10 \u03bcg/ml each of anti-\u03b1/\u03b2, anti-CD3, CD40-Ig or MR1. RNA synthesis was determined as described in FIG. 1. Results presented are the arithmetic means of triplicate cultures\u00b1s.d., and are representative of 3 such experiments. </p>FIG. 6. MR1 and CD40-Ig recognized the same molecule expressed on activated T<sub>h</sub>. </p> Panel A: Activated T<sub>h </sub>were fluorescently stained with MR1 or control Ig. To evaluate if CD40-Ig and MR1 competed for binding to activated T<sub>h</sub>, graded concentrations of MR1 or control hamster Ig (anti-\u03b1/\u03b2 TCR) were added together with anti-CD40 (20 \u03bcg/ml). After incubation for 20 minutes at 4 C, the samples were washed and incubated with FITC-conjugated, mab anti-human IgG<sub>1</sub>. Results are representative of 3 such experiments. </p> Panel B: Proteins from [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine-labelled, activated T<sub>h </sub>were immunoprecipitated with MR1 (10 \u03bcg/sample) or CD40-Ig (10 \u03bcg/sample) and resolved by PAGE and fluorography. Results presented are representative of 2 such experiments. </p>FIG. 7 Binding of CD40-Ig to human cell lines. A variety of human T-cell lines were exposed to biotin-labelled CD40-Ig, and binding was evaluated by flow cytometry. </p>FIG. 8 Panel A: Nucleotide sequence of CD40 cDNA from Stamenkovic et al., (1989) EMBO J. 8:1403-1410. The transmembrane regio",
    "ated T<sub>h</sub>1 cells (D1.6) at weekly intervals for six weeks. When the serum titer against murine T<sub>h</sub>1 was greater than about 1:10,000, cell fusions were performed with polyethylene glycol using immune hamster splenocytes and NSI. SN from wells containing growing hybridomas were screened by flow cytometry on resting and activated T<sub>h</sub>1. One particular hybridoma, which produced a mab that selectively recognized activated T<sub>h</sub>, was further tested and sublconed to derive MR1. MR1 was produced in ascites and purified by ion exchange HPLC. </p> The present invention also provides for ligands comprising monoclonal antibodies, and fragments thereof that are capable of competitively inhibiting the binding of MR1 to its target antigen or CD40-Ig to its receptor. </p> 5.2. Methods Used to Characterize CD40CR </p> CD40CR may be characterized by (i) its ability to bind CD40, fusion molecules comprising at least a portion of CD40, and antibodies such as MR1; (ii) its functional characteristic of being able to stimulate B-cell cycle entry, proliferation, and differentiation; and (iii) its cellular distribution. </p> 5.2.1. Ability to Bind Ligands </p> CD40CR may be characterized by its ability to bind to ligands such as CD40, fusion molecules comprising CD40, and antibodies directed toward CD40CR. </p> As discussed in greater detail infra, several techniques were used to characterize CD40CR. For example, CD40-Ig and MR1 were shown to recognize the same 39 kD molecule. Both CD40-Ig and MR1 were found to immunoprecipitate a 39 kD protein from radiolabelled T<sub>h </sub>lysates (FIG. 5B). Further, immunoprecipitation of the 39 kD protein with CD40-Ig removed the antigen recognized by MR1 from T<sub>h </sub>lysates. </p> 5.2.2. Ability to Stimulate B-cells </p> CD40CR may also be characterized by its ability to stimulate B-cell cycle entry, proliferation,and differentiation. </p> For example, plasma membrane (PM) from activated (PM<sup>Act</sup>) but not resting (PM<sup>rest</sup>) T<sub>h </sub>cells was found to induce B-cell RNA synthesis (FIG. 1a); this induction, indicative of B-cell activation, was not; affected by antibodies such as anti-LFA-1, anti-CD4, anti-ICAM-1. CD40-Ig or MR1, however, were found to be able to inhibit PM<sup>Act</sup>-induced B-cell activation, as shown in FIG. 1B and FIG. 5. </p> The induction of B-cell activation may be measured by techniques such as [<sup>3</sup>H]-uridine incorporation into RNA (as B-cells differentiate, RNA synthesis increases), or by [<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine incorporation, which measures DNA synthesis associated with cell proliferation. For optimal measurement of the effect of CD40CR on B-cell proliferation, interleukin-4 (IL-4) may be added to the culture medium at a concentration of about 10 ng/ml. </p> Alternatively, B-cell activation may be measured as a function of immunoglobulin secretion. For example, CD40CR, in substantially purified form, or as present in PM, or otherwise, may be added to resting B-cells together with IL-4 (10 ng/ml) and IL-5 (5 ng/ml). After three days of culture, an additional volume of culture medium may be added. On ",
    " resting (negative control) and activated (positive control) T<sub>h </sub>cells. All cells may be incubated at a concentration of about 1\u00d710<sup>5 </sup>cells/50 \u03bcl with ligand (e.g. CD40-Ig or MR1) for 20 minutes at 4\u00b0 C., followed by FITC-conjugated anti-ligand antibody. Propidium iodide may be added to all samples to a final concentration of 2 \u03bcg/ml. Flow cytometric analysis may then be performed, for example on a BD FACSCAN. After positive gating of cells by forward versus side scatter, and by red negativity (for propidium iodide exclusion), and the log green fluorescence of viable cells may be ascertained </p> The present invention provides for substantially purified CD40CR. Such CD40CR may be prepared from cells bearing CD40CR, such as activiated helper T-cells, Jurkat, and HSB2 cells, by the following method. </p> 5.3 Preparation of Purified CD40CR </p> Plasma membranes may be prepared from appropriate cells, such as activated T<sub>h </sub>1 cells, by discontinuous sucrose gradient sedimentation, as described in Noelle et al., 1991, J. Immunol. 146:1118-1124. CD40CR may then be isolated by dissociating the crude membrane extract with mild detergent, and then performing size exclusion chromatography followed by either affinity chromatography using appropriate ligands (e.g. MR1 or CD40-Ig) bound to a solid support, immunoprecipitation (e.g. by CD40-Ig or MR1), and/or gel electrophoresis. </p> The resulting protein may be expected to have a molecular weight of about 39 kD. </p> The present invention provides for a soluble CD40CR (i.e. cell-free) which may be comprised in pharmaceutical compositions together with a suitable carrier. It further provides for CD40CR which is linked to a second molecule which may be a peptide, protein, lipid, carbohydrate, enzyme, toxin, growth factor, lymphokine, antiproliferative agent, alkylating agent, antimetabolite, antibiotic, vinca alkaloid, platinum coordinated complex, radioisotope, or a fluorescent compound. </p> The present invention further provides for substantially purified CD40CR which has been prepared by chemical synthesis or recombinant DNA techniques. For example, the gene for CD40CR may be isolated by inserting cDNA prepared from activated helper T-cells into the \u03bbgt10 expression system, and then screening with MR1 or CD40-Ig binding to identify CD40CR-expressing clones. Alternatively, cDNA prepared from activated helper T-cells may be transfected into COS cells, the supernatants of which may be screened with MR1 or CD40-Ig to identify CD40CR producers. The gene for CD40CR may be then used to express CD40CR using expression systems known in the art. </p> 5.4. Uses of Ligands that Bind to CD40CR </p> The present invention provides for methods of controlling B-cell activation that utilize ligands that bind to CD40CR. In particular, it provides for a method of inhibiting B-cell activation comprising exposing a mixture of B-cells and T<sub>h </sub>cells to an effective concentration of ligand th",
    " were activated for 16 hours with insolubilized anti-CD3, harvested and irradiated. The irradiated T<sub>h</sub>1 were cultured with B-cells in the presence of IL4 and B-cell proliferation was determined on day 3 of culture. An exogenous source of IL4 was required to achieve B-cell proliferation with T<sub>h</sub>1, because T<sub>h</sub>1 do not produce IL4 (Noelle et al., (1989) J. Immunol. 143:1807-1814). CD40-Ig inhibited the induction of B-cell proliferation by irradiated T<sub>h </sub>in a dose-dependent manner, similar to that observed with PM<sup>Act </sup>(FIG. 2B). The negative control, CD7E-Ig, exerted no appreciable effect. </p> 6.2.3 CD40-Ig Detected a Molecule Expressed on Activated, But Not Resting T<sub>h </sub></p> To investigate whether activated T<sub>h</sub>1 express a binding protein for CD40, resting and activated (16 hours) T<sub>h</sub>1 were stained with CD40-Ig or CD7E-Ig, followed by FITC-anti-HigG. Binding of CD40-Ig was assessed by flow cytometry (FIG. 3). T<sub>h</sub>1 that were activated for 16 hours with anti-CD3, but not resting T<sub>h</sub>1, stained 56% positive with CD40-Ig, but not with the control CD7E-Ig. To identify the CD40-Ig binding protein, T<sub>h</sub>1 proteins were biosynthetically labelled with [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine/cysteine and proteins immunoprecipitated with CD40-Ig or CD7E-Ig. The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and fluorography (FIG. 4). A prominent band with an apparent molecular weight of 39 kD immunoprecipitated in a dose-dependent manner with 1 and 10 \u03bcg of CD40/sample. As controls, anti-class I mab immunoprecipitated bands at 55 kD and a low molecular weight band, \u03b22 microglobulin. In the absence of mab, no prominent bands were visible. A 39 kd band was also immunoprecipitated from activated T<sub>h </sub>that were vectorially labelled with <sup>125</sup>I, confirming that the 39 kD protein was a membrane protein. </p> 6.2.4. Monoclonal Antibody Mr1, Specific to 39 kd T<sub>h </sub>Membrane Protein, Inhibited the Induction of B-Cell RNA Synthesis By PM<sup>Act </sup></p> Mabs specific to antigens selectively expressed on activated versus resting T<sub>h </sub>were developed to identify T<sub>h </sub>molecule(s) responsible for the T<sub>h </sub>effector phase activity. One such mab, MR1, recognized an antigen that was selectively expressed on activated T<sub>h</sub>1. To investigate whether MR1 and CD40-Ig recognized the same molecule, flow cytometry and blocking studies were performed. CD40-Ig and MR1 stained approximately 56% and 61%, respectively, of activated, but not resting T<sub>h </sub>(FIG. 5A). MR1, but not another hamster anti-T cell mab, anti-\u03b1/\u03b2 TCR, blocked the staining of activated T<sub>h</sub>1 with CD40-Ig, in a dose-dependent manner. These data suggested that CD40-Ig and MR1 recognized overlapping or identical epitopes on the 39 kD T<sub>h </sub>protein. To further demonstrate that CD40-Ig and MR1 recognized the same molecule, the antigen that bound MR1 was identified by immunoprecipitation of proteins from radiolabelled T<sub>h </sub>lysates. Both CD40-Ig and MR1 immunoprecipitated a 39 kD protein (FIG. 5B). Finally, immunoprecipitation of the 39 kD protein with CD40-Ig removed the antigen recognized by MR1 from radiolabelled lysates of activated T<sub>h </sub>supporting the tenet that MR1 antigen and the CD40 binding protein were identical. </p> Functional studies were performed with MR1 to address whether this mab neutralized the activity expressed by PM<sup>Act</sup>. PM<sup>Act </sup>and B-cells were cultured alone, or in the presence of hamster mabs or CD40-Ig. Two hamster mabs, anti-\u03b1/\u03b2 TCR and \u03b1-CD3 did not inhibit the activation of resting B-cells by PM<sup>Act</sup>. In contrast, MR1 or CD40-Ig inhibited B-cell activation (FIG. 6). </p> 6.3 Discussion </p> The data show that blocking of prominent T<sub>h </sub>surface molecules (LFA-1, CD4, ICAM- 1, CD3, \u03b1,\u03b2 TCR) with mabs did not impede the capacity of activated T<sub>h </sub>to induce B-cell cycle entry. In contrast, CD40-Ig or a maB specific to the CD40 binding protein, blocked T<sub>h</sub>-dependent B-cell activation in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the CD40 binding protein was identified as a 39 kD protein that is selectively expressed on the membranes of activated, but not resting T<sub>h</sub>. Both CD40-Ig and a mab specific to the 39 kD CD40 binding protein blocked B-cell activation by PM<sup>Act</sup>. </p> Although a number of membrane proteins have been implicated in T<sub>h</sub>-dependent B-cell signalling, evidence presented herein dismisses the contribution of some molecules (LFA-1, CD4, CD3, \u03b1,\u03b2 TCR, ICAM-1) and implicates CD40 as the B-cell receptor for cognate signalling by T<sub>h</sub>. Data show that CD40-Ig and a mab specific to the CD40 binding protein inhibits T<sub>h</sub>-dependent B-cell activation. </p> The ligand for CD40 is a 39 kD protein that is expressed on activated, but not resting T<sub>h</sub>. Biochemical studies indicate that the 39 kD protein is a single chain molecule since electrophoretic migration was not influenced by reducing agents. Based on the functional studies presented in this study, both activated T<sub>h</sub>1 and T<sub>h</sub>2 express the 39 kD CD40 binding protein. This is consistent with the functional studies that show both T<sub>h</sub>1 and T<sub>h</sub>2 induce B-cell cycle entry. In an attempt to further characterize the 39 kD protein, cDNA encoding CD proteins in the MW range of 39 kD (CD 53, CD27 and CD69) were transiently transfected into COS cells and the cells were tested for CD40-Ig binding. None of the transfected COS cells expressed proteins that bound CD40-Ig. It is therefore suspected that the 39 kD protein is not one of these CD proteins. </p> The biochemical basis for signal transduction between T<sub>h </sub>and B-cells has been elusive. The identification of CD40 as the signal transducing molecule for T cell help focusses attention on specific biochemical pathways known to be coupled to the CD40 molecule. CD40 is a member of the nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) family by the virtue of the presence of four cysteine-rich motifs in its extracellular region. Signaling through CD40 by mab has been shown (Uckun et al., (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266:17478-17485) to involve the activation of tyrosine kinases resulting in the increased production of inositol trisphosphate and the activation of at least four distinct serine/threonine kinases. Based on information obtained from signaling through other members of the NGF receptor family, it is anticipated that interaction between activated T<sub>h </sub>and B will result in many of the same biochemical processes. </p>7. EXAMPLE Binding of CD40 Ig To Human T-Cell Lines  For immunofluorescence binding studies, CD40 Ig fusion protein was conjugated with biotin using biotin-succinimide (Sigma). Flow cytometry analysis was then performed by tow-step staining using phycoerythrin (PE)-strepavidin (Bectin-Dickinson) with a Coulter Epics C instrument. Representative results of screening multiple T cell lines is presented below. The Jurkat and HSB2 cell lines were found to bind specifically, whereas other T cell lines including CEM, HPB"
