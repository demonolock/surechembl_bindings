LTB4 recruits and activates natural killer cells, monocytes and eosinophils. It increases superoxide radical formation [8] and modulates gene expression including the production of a number of proinflammatory cytokines and mediators which may augment and prolong tissue inflammation [9,10], LTB4 also has roles in the induction and management of adaptive immune responses. For example, regulation of dendritic cell trafficking to draining lymph nodes [11 ,12], Th2 cytokine IL-13 production from lung T cells [13], recruitment of antigen-specific effector CD8+ T cells [14] and activation and proliferation of human B lymphocytes [15]. </p><p id=\"p0021\" num=\"0021\">LTB4 and the hydroxyeicosanoids mediate their effects though the BLT1 and BLT2 G-protein coupled receptors on cell surfaces [16,17], Human BLT1 is a high affinity receptor (KD 0.39 - 1 ,5nM; [18]) specific for LTB4 with only 20-hydroxy LTB4 and 12-epi LTB4 in high concentrations able to displace LTB4 in competitive binding studies [19], Human BLT2 has a 20-fold lower affinity (KD 23nM) for LTB4 than BLT1 and is activated by a broader range of eicosanoids including 12-epi LTB4, 20-hydroxy LTB4, 12(S)- and 15(S)-HETE and 12(S)- and 15(S)-HPETE [19], </p><p id=\"p0022\" num=\"0022\">Human BLT1 is mainly expressed on the surface of leukocytes, though it has recently been described in endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells. Human BLT2 is expressed in a broader range of tissue and cell types. A number of specific small molecule antagonists of BLT1 and BLT2 have been described which inhibit activation, extravasation and apoptosis of human neutrophils [20 ] and reduce symptoms caused by neutrophil infiltration in mouse models of inflammatory arthritis [21] and renal ischaemia reperfusion [22], Increasing numbers of studies indicate that both BLT1 and BLT2 can mediate pathological effects through LTB4 and hydroxyeicosanoids [23], although BLT1 certainly has a dominant role in some pathologies such as collagen induced arthritis in mice [24], BLT1-/- deficient mice have also highlighted the importance of BLT1 in directing neutrophil migration in inflammatory responses. In particular, a 5-LOX deficient mouse strain was used to show autocrine activation of BLT1 on neutrophils is needed fortheir recruitment into arthritic joints [25], </p><p id=\"p0023\" num=\"0023\">A number of marketed drugs target the eicosanoids.

In embodiments comprising more than one (e.g., two) bioactive polypeptides, one of the bioactive polypeptides may have an affinity for C5 and/or LTB4 which is lower than nomacopan. For example, a bioactive polypeptide fused at its C-terminus to a PA(S) polypeptide may have a lower affinity for C5 than nomacopan, \n<!-- EPO <DP n=\"14\"/>-->\nbecause nomacopan binding to C5 includes an interaction via its C-terminus.

Nomacopan is an outlying member of the lipocalin family and is the first lipocalin family member shown to inhibit complement activation. Nomacopan inhibits the classical, alternative and lectin complement pathways by binding to C5 and preventing its cleavage by C5 convertase into C5a and C5b, thus inhibiting both the production of C5a, which is an active (e.g. proinflammatory) peptide, and the formation of the MAC.

For example, binding activity for LTB4 (Caymen Chemicals, Ann Arbor, Ml, USA) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) can be quantified in a spectrofluorimeter e.g. a LS 50 B spectrofluorimeter (Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT, USA).

A ligand solution of 30 pM LTB4 in PBS was added step-wise, up to a maximal volume of 20 pL (1 % of the whole sample volume), and after 30 s incubation steady state fluorescence was measured at each step. For calculation of the KD value, data was normalized to an initial fluorescence intensity of 100 %, the inner filter effect was corrected using a titration of 3 pM N-acetyl-tryptophanamide solution and data was plotted against the corresponding ligand concentration. Then, non-linear least squares regression based on the law of mass action for bimolecular complex formation was used to fit the data with Origin software version 8.5 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA, USA) using a published formula (Breustedt et al., 2006) [50], </p><p id=\"p0151\" num=\"0151\">Nomacopan may bind LTB4 with a KD of less than 1 nM, more conveniently less than 0.9nM, most conveniently less than 0.8nM, preferably less than 0.7nM, more preferably less than 0.6nM, most preferably less than 0.5nM, even more preferably less than 0.4 nM, and advantageously less than 0.3nM, wherein said KD is determined using fluorescence titration, preferably in accordance with the method above.
