The protein-bound polysaccharide is an extract from mycelia, broth, or fruit bodies that is obtained by culturing the fungus belonging to Coriolus, which belongs to Basidiomycetes. The protein-bound polysaccharide contains about 18 to 38% by weight of proteins, and has a molecular weight of not less than 5,000, preferably 5000 to 3000,000. Further, the protein-bound polysaccharide is described in \"Saikin no Shinyaku (Recent New Medicines)\", Vol. 28, 14-16, 1977; and Vol. 29, 96-101, 1978; and \"Iyakuhin Yoran (Handbook of Medicines)\", 6th Ed., 1346, 1979, published by Yakuji Jiho Publishing Co.</p>A typical example of the protein-"
