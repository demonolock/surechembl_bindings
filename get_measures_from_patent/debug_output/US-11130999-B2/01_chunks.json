    " 3 WT mice (untreated). In groups in which LNP-Cre was delivered, it was delivered at a concentration of 1 mg/kg. In groups in which AAV8-gRNA was delivered, it was delivered at a viral load of approximately 2\u00d710<sup>11</sup>. One and three weeks post-injection, mice were bled for serum chemistry and to measure circulating serum levels of target protein 3. At three weeks, tissues were also harvested for NGS and for western analysis. Serum levels of target protein 3 were measured by ELISA. The results are shown in FIG. 10. Delivery of LNP-Cre to LSL-Cas9 mice together with AAV8-gRNA resulted in a decrease in serum levels of target protein 3 consistent with the decrease observed in cassette-deleted Cas9 mice in which AAV8-gRNA was delivered. These ELISA results were consistent with the NGS results for percent editing in target gene 3 in livers isolated from the mice 3 weeks post-injection. See FIG. 11.</p>Next, LSL-Cas9 mice were crossed with albumin-Cre mice from Jax (3601-Tg(Alb-cre)21Mgn; MAID3601) in which the albumin promoter is operably linked to the Cre recombinase coding sequence and drives its expression in the liver. Following the cross, several tissues were harvested from the mice for western blot analysis. Corresponding tissues were harvested from LSL-Cas9 mice that were not crossed with the albumin-Cre mice. Western blots measuring Cas9 expression in the liver and brain were then performed. Actin was used as a loading control. The predicted size of Cas9 was 150.48 kD, and the predicted size of actin was 41.25 kD. 17.5 \u03bcg of liver protein lysates and brain protein lysates were used. TruCut v2 Cas9 (17.5 \u03bcg) was used as a positive control. As shown in FIG. 12A, Cas9 expression was observed in the livers of LSL-Cas9/Alb-Cre mice but not in the livers of LSL-Cas9 mice. Cas9 expression was not observed in the brain tissues from any of the mice (see FIG. 12B), confirming that Cas9 expression was induced specifically in the liver.</p>An experiment was performed to test Cas9-mediated gene editing in vivo in these mice. The experiment included five groups of 8-12-week old mice injected with AAV8-gRNA targeting target gene 3 via tail vein injection: (1) 3 mice LSL-Cas9:Alb-Cre (MAID2599 Het, MAID3601 Het); (2) 3 mice WT:Alb-Cre (MAID2599 WT, MAID3601 Het); (3) 3 mice LSL-Cas9:WT (MAID2599 Het, MAID3601 WT); (4) 3 Mice Cas9 (MAID2600 Het or Hom); and (5) 3 Mice 75/25 (50500 WT). Mice from each group also served as controls that were not injected with AAV8-gRNA. In groups in which AAV8-gRNA was delivered, it was delivered at a viral load of approximately 2\u00d710<sup>11</sup>. One week post-injection, the mice were bled for serum chemistry and ELISAs. Three weeks post-injection, the mice were bled and tissues were harvested. The results are shown in FIG. 13. Crossing the LSL-Cas9 mice with the albumin-Cre mice and then injecting AAV8-gRNA resulted in a decrease in serum levels of target protein 3 consistent with the decrease observed in cassette-deleted Cas9 mice in which AAV8-gRNA was delivered."
