    "ar tumor type or invariably becomes expressed of activated as the disease progresses.</p>An IGF-IR antagonist can be an extracellular antagonist or an intracellular antagonist and more than one antagonist may be employed. Extracellular antagonists include, but are not limited to proteins or other biological molecules that bind to IGF-IR or one or more of its ligands (e.g, IGF-I and IGF-II are natural ligands of IGF-IR). In an embodiment of the invention, an extracellular antagonist inhibits binding of IGF-IR to its ligands. In one embodiment, the antagonist is an anti- IGF-IR antibody, such as, for example, IMC-A12. In another embodiment, the antagonist is a soluble ligand binding fragment of IGF-IR. Intracellular IGF-IR antagonists can be biological molecules, but are usually small molecules. Examples include, but are not limited to, tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1024 (Calbiochem), insulin-like growth factor-I receptor kinase inhibitor NVP-AEW541 (Novartis), and insulin-like growth factor-I/insulin receptor inhibitor BMS-554417 (Bristol Myers Squibb). It will be appreciated that useful small molecule to be used in the invention are inhibitors of IGF-IR, but need not be completely specific for IGF-IR.</p>Anti-IGF-IR antibodies to be used according to the present invention exhibit one or more of following properties:</p>1) The antibodies bind to the external domain of IGF-IR and inhibit binding of IGF-I or IGF-II to IGF-IR. Inhibition can be determined, for example, by a direct binding assay using purified or membrane bound receptor. In this embodiment, the antibodies of the present invention, or fragments thereof, preferably bind IGF-IR at least as strongly as the natural ligands of IGF-IR (IGF-I and IGF-II).</p>2) The antibodies neutralize IGF-IR. Binding of a ligand, e.g., IGF-I or IGF-II, to an external, extracellular domain of IGF-IR stimulates autophosphorylation of the beta subunit and downstream signaling molecules, including MAPK, Akt, and IRS-1.</p>Neutralization of IGF-IR includes inhibition, diminution, inactivation and/or disruption of one or more of these activities normally associated with signal transduction. Neutralization can be determined in vivo, ex vivo, or in vitro using, for example, tissues, cultured cell, or purified cellular components. Neutralization includes inhibition of IGF-IR / IR heterodimers as well as IGF-IR homodimers. Thus, neutralizing IGF-IR has various effects, including inhibition, diminution, inactivation and/or disruption of growth (proliferation and differentiation), angiogenesis (blood vessel recruitment, invasion, and metastasis), and cell motility and metastasis (cell adhesion and invasiveness).</p>One measure of IGF-IR neutralization is inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor. Tyrosine kinase inhibition can be determined using well-known methods; for example, by measuring the autophosphorylation level of recombinant kinase receptor, and/or phosphorylation of natural or synthetic subst",
    "ective (Fig. 12D) than the 30-minute incubation time (Fig. 12B and C). One possible explanation is that IMC-3G3 induces internalization of PDGFR\u03b1 and that its inhibitory effect is related not only to blocking of ligand binding, but also to the removal of the receptor from the plasma membrane.</p>Example 3</p>Isolation of Human Anti-PDGFR\u03b1 Antibodies. Human ant-PDGFR\u03b1 monoclonal antibodies were generated by a standard hybridoma technology (Harlow &amp; Lane, ed., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor, 211-213 (1998), which is incorporated by reference herein) using transgenic mice (Medarex Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) that express human gamma heavy and kappa light immunoglobulin chains. Human PDGFRa extracellular domain (ECD) was purchased from purchased from R&amp;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). KM mice were immunized subcutaneously (s.c.) with 3x10<sup>7</sup> porcine aortic endothelial cells stably expressing PDGFRa (PAE Ra). After 4 weeks, mice were boosted s.c. with 50 \u00b5g PDGFRa ECD in complete Freund's adjuvant plus 3 x 10<sup>7</sup> PAE Ra cells given i.p. Mice were boosted two more times, 3 weeks apart, with 25 \u00b5g PDGFRa ECD in incomplete Freund's adjuvant.</p>Splenocytes from mice with high serum binding and blocking titers were isolated and fused with myeloma cells. Hybridoma cultures displaying blocking activity were subcloned and antibodies from these hybridomas were purified by protein G chromatography.</p>IgGs were evaluated for binding to PDGFR\u03b1 in a direct binding assay. PDGFRa ECD in PBS was immobilized onto a 96-well plate (100 ng/well). Plates were then washed with PBST (PBS + 0.05% Tween 20) and blocked with PBSM (3% milk in PBS, 200 \u00b5L/well) for 2 hours at 25\u00b0C. IgGs diluted in PBSM were incubated with the immobilized PDGFRa ECD for 1 hr at 25\u00b0C, and the plates were washed with PBST. A secondary antibody (goat F(ab')<sub>2</sub> antihuman IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate; BioSource International, Camarillo, CA) diluted 1:5,000 in PBSM was added for 1 hour at 25\u00b0C. After the plates were washed with PBST, a TMB peroxidase substrate (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) was added and the reaction was stopped with 100 \u00b5L of 1 mol/L H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Plates were read at A450 nm using a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).</p>PDGF blocking was evaluated using a solid-phase PDGF blocking assay (see Duan et al., 1991, J. Biol. Chem. 266:413-8, which is incorporated by reference). PDGFR\u03b1 ECD was diluted in PBS and coated on 96-well microtiter plates (Immulon 2HB flat-bottomed 1 x 12 Removawell strips of irradiated protein binding polystyrene; Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA). Each well was coated with 60 ng PDGFR\u03b1 for 3 hours at 25\u00b0C in a total volume of 100 \u00b5L. Plates were then washed twice and blocked overnight at 4\u00b0C with 25 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.45), 0.5% gelatin, 100 mmol/L NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20. Plates were then warmed to 25\u00b0C for 20 minutes and washed once with binding buffer (25 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.45), 0.3% gelatin, 100 mmol/L NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20). Fifty microliters of IgGs were added to each well and incubated at 25\u00b0C for 30 minutes. Iodinated PDGF was diluted in binding buffer and added (50 \u00b5L of a 1 nmol/L solution) to each well. Plates were incubated for 2 hours at 25\u00b0C and then washed five times with binding buffer. Each well was counted in a gamma counter. A cell-based blocking assay was done as described in Heldin et al., 1988, EMBO J. 7, 1387-93.</p>The kinetics of antibody binding to PDGFR\u03b1 was measured using a BIAcore 3000 instrument (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ). PDGFR\u03b1 ECD was immobilized onto a sensor chip and antibody was injected at various concentrations. Sensograms were obtained at each concentration and evaluated using the BIA Evaluation 2.0 program to determine the rate constants. The affinity constant, K<sub>d</sub>, was calculated from the ratio of rate constants K<sub>off</sub>/K<sub>on</sub>.</p>Fig. 13 shows dose-dependent binding of the human monoclonal antibody IMC-3G3 to immobilized PDGFR\u03b1 ECD in the ELISA. The antibody concentration required for 50% maximum binding to PDGFR\u03b1 ECD was 0.06 nmol/L (Table 6). The ED<sub>50</sub> is consistent with the Kd for the antibody as determined by surface plasmon resonance on a BIAcore instrument (Table 1). The monoclonal antibody also blocked [<sup>125</sup>I]PDGF-BB binding to immobilized receptor, with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.43 nmol/L. The binding sites for PDGF-AA and PDGF-BB on PDGFR\u03b1 are not structurally coincident. The data suggests that the epitope for 3G3 spatially overlaps both growth factor binding sites.\nTable 6 - Binding characteristics of anti-PDGFR\u03b1 antibodyPDGFR\u03b1 bindingPDGF blockingBinding kinetics(ED<sub>50</sub>, nmol/L)Solid phase (IC<sub>50</sub>, nmol/L)Cell based (IC<sub>50</sub>, nmol/L)K<sub>on</sub> (10<sup>5</sup> mol/L<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>)K<sub>off</sub> (10<sup>-4</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>)K<sub>d</sub> (10<sup>-9</sup> mol/L)0.060.240.5811.500.470.04</p>Inhibition of receptor phosphorylation and activation of downstream effector molecules. The effects on PDGF-induced intracellular signaling by IMC-3G3 was determined using PAE R\u03b1 cells. Cells were seeded in six-well Falcon tissue culture plates (250,000 cells per well) and allowed to grow overnight. Wells were then rinsed and incubated in serum-free medium. After an overnight incubation to render cells quiescent, the cells were treated with antibodies for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C followed by addition of PDGF-AA or PDGF-BB and incubation for an additional 10 minutes at 37\u00b0C. Cells were then detached and lysed in 200 \u00b5L lysis buffer (50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 % Triton X-100, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDT"
