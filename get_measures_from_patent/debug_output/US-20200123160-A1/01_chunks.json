The compounds of the present invention can be synthesized using the methods described below, together with synthetic methods known in the art of synthetic organic chemistry, or by variations thereon as appreciated by those skilled in the art. Preferred methods include, but are not limited to, those described below. The reactions are performed in a solvent or solvent mixture appropriate to the reagents and materials employed and suitable for the transformations being effected. It will be understood by those skilled in the art of organic ",
    "e Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20th Edition, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. (2000).</p>The invention includes administering to a subject a pharmaceutical composition that includes a compound that binds to PAR4 and inhibits PAR4 cleavage and/or signaling (referred to herein as a \u201cPAR4 antagonist\u201d or \u201ctherapeutic compound\u201d).</p>The compounds of this disclosure can be administered in such oral dosage forms as tablets, capsules (each of which includes sustained release or timed release formulations), pills, powders, granules, elixirs, tinctures, suspensions, syrups, and emulsions. They may also be administered in intravenous (bolus or infusion), intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, or intramuscular form, all using dosage forms well known to those of ordinary skill in the pharmaceutical arts. They can be administered alone, but generally will be administered with a pharmaceutical carrier selected on the basis of the chosen route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice.</p>The preferred dose of the PAR4 antagonist is a biologically active dose. A biologically active dose is a dose that will inhibit cleavage and/or signaling of PAR4 and have an anti-thrombotic effect. Desirably, the PAR4 antagonist has the ability to reduce the activity of PAR4 by at least 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, or more than 100% below untreated control levels. The levels of PAR4 in platelets is measured by any method known in the art, including, for example, receptor binding assay, platelet aggregation, platelet activation assays (e.g., p-selectin expression by FACS), Western blot or ELISA analysis using PAR4 cleavage sensitive antibodies. Alternatively, the biological activity of PAR4 is measured by assessing cellular signaling elicited by PAR4 (e.g., calcium mobilization or other second messenger assays).</p>In some embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount of a PAR4 compound is preferably from about less than 100 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, or less than 1 mg/kg. In a more preferred embodiment, the therapeutically effective amount of the PAR4 compound is less than 5 mg/kg. In a most preferred embodiment, the therapeutically effective amount of the PAR4 compound is less than 1 mg/kg. Effective doses vary, as recognized by those skilled in the art, depending on route of administration and excipient usage.</p>Compounds of this invention can be administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal routes, using transdermal skin patches. When administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen.</p>The compounds are typically administered in admixture with suitable pharmaceutical diluents, excipients, or carriers (collectively referred to herein as pharmaceutical carriers) suitably selected with respect to the intended form of administration, that is, oral t"
