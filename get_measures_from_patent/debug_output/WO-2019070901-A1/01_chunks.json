Methods and techniques for the production of recombinant proteins are well known in the art. </p>[0083] \"Single-chain antibodies\" are Fv molecules in which the heavy and light chain variable regions have been connected by a flexible linker to form a single polypeptide chain, which forms an antigen- binding region. Single chain antibodies are discussed in detail in International Patent Application Publication No. WO 88/01649 and United States Patent Nos. 4,946,778 and No. 5,260,203. </p>[0084] A \"solid tumor\" refers to an abnormal growth or mass of tissue that usually does not contain cysts or liquid areas. Solid tumors may be benign (not cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Different types of solid tumors are named for the type of cells that form them. Examples of solid tumors are sarcomas, carcinomas, and lymphomas. Leukemias (cancers of the blood) generally do not form solid tumors </p> [0085] An antigen binding protein \"specifically binds\" to an antigen when the antigen binding protein exhibits demonstrates little to no binding to molecules other than the antigen. An antigen binding protein that specifically binds an antigen may, however, cross-react with antigens from different species. Typically, an antigen binding protein specifically binds an antigen when the dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) is &lt;10<sup>\"7</sup> M as measured via a surface plasma resonance technique (e.g., BIACore, GE-Healthcare Uppsala, Sweden). An antigen binding protein specifically binds an antigen with \"high affinity\" when it binds with a K<sub>D</sub> &lt;5xl0<sup>\"8</sup> M, and with \"very high affinity\" when it binds with a K<sub>D</sub> is &lt;5x 10<sup>\"9</sup> M (as measured using a method such as BIACore). </p> [0086] A \"subject\" or \"patient\" as used herein can be any mammal. In a typical embodiment, the subject or patient is a human. </p> [0087] As used herein, \"substantially pure\" means that the described species of molecule is the predominant species present, that is, on a molar basis it is more abundant than any other individual species in the same mixture. In certain embodiments, a substantially pure molecule is a composition wherein the object species comprises at least 50% (on a molar basis) of all macromolecular species present. In other embodiments, a substantially pure composition will comprise at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 99% of all macromolecular species present in the composition. In other embodiments, the object species is purified to essential homogeneity wherein contaminating species cannot be detected in the composition by conventional detection methods and thus the composition consists of a single detectable macromolecular species. </p> [0088] The term \"treating\" refers to any indication of success in the treatment or amelio",

To determine antibody activity, cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 10,000 cells per well in 80 \u03bc\u0390 DMEM containing 0.5% FBS, 1% Pen/Strep/L-glutamine, 25mM Hepes, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 400 \u03bcg/ml G418. After overnight incubation, the media was removed and replaced with 5 \u03bc\u0390 fresh media followed by 5 \u03bc\u0390 of media plus 15 \u03bc\u039c forskolin (EMD Chemicals Cat # 344273) and 250 pM CP55,940 (TOCRIS Cat # 0949) followed by 40 \u03bc\u0390 of antibody in 10 mM acetic acid, 150 mM NaCl, pH 5.0. The cells were then incubated for 30 minutes at 37 \u00b0C. The media was then aspirated and cAMP levels were measured using a DiscoverX XS+ cAMP assay kit (90- \n\n 0075-03) following the manufacturer's protocol. Plates were read for 30 seconds on PerkinElmer ViewLux Microplate Imager. </p> [00203] The results of the assay are represented in Figure 4. The TTR antibody homotetramer has a 3.9 fold more favorable EC50 than the CB1 parent antibody. Some Fabs used charge pair mutations while others did not (see discussion of Figure 2 in Example 2). These results demonstrate that the TTR antibody homotetramer and TTR Fab homotetramer fusion proteins improve EC50 compared to parental CB1 Ab. Interestingly, the anti-CBl TTR antibody homodimer appears to have a less favorable EC50 than the CB1 parent antibody, with worsening EC50 as the length of the linker increases. </p>Example 4: Cloning, expression, and purification of anti-GITR TTR antibody homodimer, TTR antibody homotetramer, and TTR Fab homotetramer fusion proteins </p>Cloning of anti-GITR TTR antibody homodimer, TTR antibody homotetramer, and TTR Fab homotetramer fusion proteins </p> [00204] The anti-GITR TTR antibody homodimer and TTR antibody homotetramer fusion proteins were generally cloned as follows.
