{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n* The TTR antibody homotetramer has a 3.9 fold more favorable EC50 than the CB1 parent antibody.\n* The anti-CBl TTR antibody homodimer appears to have a less favorable EC50 than the CB1 parent antibody, with worsening EC50 as the length of the linker increases.\n* CHO cells stably expressing hCBl (Euroscreen) were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1% Pen/Strep/L-glutamine, 25 mM Hepes, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 400 \u03bcg/ml G418, and cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 10,000 cells per well in 80 \u03bc\u0390 DMEM containing 0.5% FBS, 1% Pen/Strep/L-glutamine, 25mM Hepes, 0.1 mM NEAA, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 400 \u03bcg/ml G418, and then treated with 15 \u03bc\u039c forskolin (EMD Chemicals Cat # 344273) and 250 pM CP55,940 (TOCRIS Cat # 0949). \n\nNote that the last sentence does not explicitly mention a bioactivity metric, but it does mention specific molecule names (forskolin, CP55,940) and their concentrations, which could be relevant to the context. However, without more information, it is difficult to determine if this sentence meets the criteria.\n\nUpon re-reading the text, I found another sentence that meets the criteria:\n* After overnight incubation, the media was removed and replaced with 5 \u03bc\u0390 fresh media followed by 5 \u03bc\u0390 of media plus 15 \u03bc\u039c forskolin (EMD Chemicals Cat # 344273) and 250 pM CP55,940 (TOCRIS Cat # 0949) \n\nThis sentence mentions specific molecule names (forskolin, CP55,940), their concentrations (15 \u03bc\u039c, 250 pM), and units (\u03bc\u039c, pM), but does not explicitly mention a bioactivity metric. However, the context suggests that the concentrations of these molecules may be related to their bioactivity.\n\nIf you would like me to extract more sentences or provide more context, please let me know."}
