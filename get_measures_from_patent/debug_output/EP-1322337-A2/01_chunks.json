For example, a polyamino acid such as poly-arginine, poly-histidine, poly-lysine, or cationic proteinaceous sequences comprising a mixture of arginine, histidine, and/or lysine, may have about 1, about 2, about 3, about 4, about 5, about 6, about 7, about 8, about 9, about 10, about 12, about 13, about 14, about 15, about 16, about 17, about 18, about 19, about 20, about 21, about 22, about 23, about 24, or about 25 or so, and any range derivable therein, of arginine, histidine or lysine, residues, respectively, substituted by any of the naturally occurring, modified, or unusual amino acids described herein. In other aspects of the invention, a cationic proteinaceous sequence such as poly-arginine, poly-histidine, poly-lysine, or a amino acid chain comprising a mixture of some or all of these three amino acids may have about 1%, about 2%, about 3%, about 4%, about 5%, about 6%&gt;, about 7%, about 8%, about 9%&gt;, about 10%, about 11%, about 12%, about 13%, about 14%, about 15%, about 16%, about 17%, about 18%, about 19%, about 20%, about 21%, about 22%, about 23%, about 24%, about 25%, about 26%, about 27%, about 28%&gt;, about 29%, "
