Thus the developed composition in the present invention contains sesquiterpene coumarin derived from the Ferula species in particular Ferula assafoetida have MAO (MAO-A and MAO-B) inhibitory activities. The sesquiterpene coumarin contains acyclic, mono-cyclic, and bi-cyclic skeleton-bearing sesquiterpene that are naturally attached to a coumarin via an ether linkage. The sesquiterpene coumarins are nonpolar compounds that have poor water solubility which may hinder their absorption and pharmaceutical compliance. Also, the sesquiterpene coumarin contains an ether linkage which is prone to hydrolysis in the acidic condition of the stomach. Thus the present invention aims to formulate the said sesquiterpene coumarin \n\nenriched fractions in a water-soluble composition to impart improved solubility, dispersibility, stability, and pharmaceutical compliance.
