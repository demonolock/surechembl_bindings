    "tant were quantified by a PCR-based assay for reverse transcriptase activity<sup>30</sup>. 5 \u03bcl transfection supernatant were lysed in 5 \u03bcL 0.25% Triton X-100, 50 mM KCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, and 0.4 U/\u03bcl RNase inhibitor (RiboLock, ThermoFisher). Viral lysate was then diluted 1:100 in a buffer of 5 mM (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 20 mM KCl, and 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3. 10 \u03bcL was then added to a single-step, RT PCR assay with 35 nM MS2 RNA (IDT) as template, 500 nM of each primer (5\u2032-TCCTGCTCAACTTCCTGTCGAG-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 12) and 5\u2032-CACAGGTCAAACCTCCTAGGAATG-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 13)), and hot-start Taq (Promega) in a buffer of 20 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.3, 5 mM (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 20 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 1/20,000 SYBR Green I (Invitrogen), and 200 \u03bcM dNTPs. The RT-PCR reaction was carried out in a Biorad CFX96 cycler with the following parameters: 42\u00b0 C. 20 min, 95\u00b0 C. 2 min, and 40 cycles [95\u00b0 C. for 5 s, 60\u00b0 C. 5 s, 72\u00b0 C. for 15 s and acquisition at 80\u00b0 C. for 5 s]. 3 part vector transfections typically yielded 10<sup>6 </sup>RT units/\u03bcL.</p>TransductionsFor generating pools of shRNA knockdown Jurkat and CEMx174 lines, cells were plated at 10<sup>6 </sup>cells/mL in RPMI-FBS complete and transduced with 10<sup>7 </sup>RT units of viral vector per 10<sup>6 </sup>cells, followed by selection with 1 \u03bcg/ml puromycin (InvivoGen, cat #ant-pr-1). To generate stable gag-gfp expressing Jurkat cells, cells were transduced as for shRNA KD above, followed by selection with 5 \u03bcg/mL blasticidin (InvivoGen, cat #ant-bl-1) at day 3 after transduction.</p>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were stimulated in RPMI-FBS complete, with 50 U/ml IL-2 and 5 \u03bcg/mL PHA-P (Sigma, cat #L-1668). After 3 days, T cells were washed and replated at 3\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>cells/mL in RPMI-FBS complete, with 50 U/ml IL-2. Cells were transduced with 10<sup>8 </sup>RT units of viral vector per 10<sup>6 </sup>cells followed by selection in 2 \u03bcg/mL puromycin. After selection, cells were re-plated in RPMI-FBS complete with 50 U/ml IL-2 at 3\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>cells/mL in RPMI-FBS complete and transduced again with the indicated GFP vectors, 10<sup>8 </sup>RT units of viral vector per 10<sup>6 </sup>cells. Transduced T cells were analyzed 4-5 days after the 2nd transduction.</p>Lentiviral Infections5\u00d710<sup>5 </sup>Jurkat or CEMx174 cells were incubated with 5\u00d7107 RT units of HIV-1NL4.3, HIV-2GH, HIV-2GH\u0394vpx, SIVMAC239, or SIVMAC239\u0394vpx virus stocks produced in HEK-293 cells for 12 hrs in RPMI-FBS complete media, followed by a wash in media and replated in 1 mL of media. Cells were split every 2-3 days and analyzed. For monitoring of HIV-1 ZsGreen infection, when cells were split, aliquots were fixed in BD Cytofix followed by analysis of GFP+ cells by flow cytometry to determine infection levels. For monitoring of SIV and HIV-2 infections, 50 \u03bcL aliquots of supernatant were analyzed for RT activity using the above described RT assay.</p>Re-Activation Assays"
