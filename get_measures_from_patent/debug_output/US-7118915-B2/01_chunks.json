    "93, 117 to 121 compared to apolipoprotein D. Preferably such a mutein carries an amino acid substitution at 5 to 8, more preferably at 8 to 12 of the sequence positions 38, 60, 62 to 66, 68, 90, 91, 93, 117 to 121. An ApoD mutein of this embodiment is preferred which has at least two, preferably at least three mutated amino acids at sequence positions 62 to 66 and 117 to 121 compared to the wild-type protein.</p>In a further embodiment a mutein of human ApoD is preferred that carries an amino acid substitution at six or more of the sequence positions 35, 37, 38, 66, 65, 66, 68, 91, 115, 119, and 123 compared with apolipoprotein D.</p>In addition, an ApoD mutein is also preferred that carries an amino acid substitution at nine or more of the sequence positions 34 to 38, 60, 63 to 66, 68, 89 to 93, 115, 117\u2013119 and 123 compared to apolipoprotein D.</p>In a further preferred embodiment, the mutein has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 21. This mutein is also referred to as HbgA.</p>The muteins of the invention are able to bind the desired ligand (target) with a detectable affinity, i.e. with an affinity constant of preferably at least 10<sup>5 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>. Affinities lower than this are generally no longer measurable with common methods such as ELISA and are therefore of secondary importance for practical applications. Especially preferred are muteins which bind the desired ligand/target with an affinity of at least 10<sup>6 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>, corresponding to a dissociation constant for the complex of 1 \u03bcM. The binding affinity of a mutein to the desired target can be measured by the person skilled in the art by a multitude of methods, for example by fluorescence titration, by competition ELISA or by the technique of surface plasmon resonance. In this respect, it should be noted that besides the affinity to the given, non-natural ligand the mutein can also have a detectable binding affinity towards a natural ligand of ApoD, although specifity for the non-natural ligand might be desirable.</p>The ligand or target which is bound by the mutein can be any chemical moiety that, for example, can also be recognized and bound by an immunoglobulin. Accordingly, the ligand can be a chemical compound in free or conjugated form which exhibits features of an immunological hapten, a hormone such as steroid hormones or any biopolymer or fragment thereof, for example, a peptide, a protein or protein domain, a peptide, an oligodeoxynucleotide, a nucleic acid, oligo- and polysaccharides or another macromolecule or conjugates thereof. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the target is a protein.</p>The muteins of the invention can have the natural amino acid sequence of ApoD outside the regions of the amino acid positions 34 to 38, 60, 62 to 66, 68, 89 to 93, 115, 117 to 121 and 123. On the other hand, the muteins disclosed here can also contain amino acid mutations outside the positions subjected to mutagenesis compared to the wild-type protei",
    "D muteins produced for example with pApo10 or pApoD12 carry the affinity peptide Strep-Tag II (Schmidt et al., J. Mol. Biol. 255 (1996), 753\u2013766) at their C-terminus and can therefore preferably be purified by streptavidin affinity chromatography.</p>The selection can also be carried out by means of other methods. Many corresponding embodiments are known to the person skilled in the art or are described in the literature. A combination of methods can also be applied. For example, clones selected or at least enriched by \u201cphage display\u201d can additionally be subjected to a \u201ccolony screening\u201d. This procedure has the advantage that individual clones can directly be isolated with respect to the production of an ApoD mutein with detectable binding affinity for a ligand.</p>In addition to the use of E. coli as host organism in the \u201cphage display\u201d technique or the \u201ccolony screening\u201d method, other bacterial strains, yeast or also insect cells or mammalian cells can for example be used for this purpose. In addition to the selection of an ApoD mutein from a primary library produced starting from a coding nucleic acid sequence for a mutein, comparable methods can also be applied in order to optimize a mutein with respect to the affinity or specificity for the desired ligand by repeated, optionally limited mutagenesis of its coding nucleic acid sequence.</p>It is surprising that by use of the method of the invention ApoD muteins can be isolated which show high affinity to a given ligand. A binding constant of more than 10<sup>6 </sup>M<sup>\u22121 </sup>was determined for hemoglobin with one of the muteins described in the examples. This affinity value is of the same order of magnitude as the affinity of ApoD to its possible natural ligands progesterone and arachidonic acid (Vogt &amp; Skerra, J. Mol. Recognit. 14 (2001), 79\u201386). Moreover, hemoglobin bears no structural relationship whatsoever to progesterone or arachidonic acid.</p>It is also possible to attain affinities for given ligands with the ApoD mutein that are comparable with the affinities which are known for antibodies from the secondary immune response. It is additionally possible to subject the ApoD muteins produced to a further, optionally partial random mutagenesis in order to select variants of even higher affinity from the new library thus obtained. Corresponding procedures have already been described for the case of recombinant antibody fragments for the purpose of an \u201caffinity maturation\u201d (Low et al., supra; Barbas and Burton, Trends Biotechnol. 14 (1996), 230\u2013234) and can also be applied to an ApoD mutein disclosed here in a corresponding manner by the person skilled in the art.</p>The invention is further illustrated by the following examples and the attached drawings in which:</p>FIG. 1 schematically illustrates the production of the library of lipocalin muteins at the nucleic acid level;</p>FIG. 2 schematically depicts the phasmid vector pApoD19;</p>FIG. 3 schematically depicts the expression",
    " Ultrafree-4 centrifugation filters (Millipore), and sterile-filtered (0.45 \u03bcm). The concentration of HbgA and also of ApoD were determined by absorption at 280 nm using a calculated extinction coefficient of 54600 M<sup>\u22121 </sup>cm<sup>\u22121 </sup>and 34150 M<sup>\u22121 </sup>cm<sup>\u22121</sup>, respectively (Gill and von Hippel, Anal. Biochem. 182 (1989), 319\u2013326). The solution was diluted with HBS to a series of concentrations ranging from 10 \u03bcM to 0.5 \u03bcM, and surfactant P20 was added to a final concentration of 0.005%. The binding of HbgA to hemoglobin, immobilized on the sensor chip, was measured by applying each 75 \u03bcl of these protein solutions. Steady state resonance values were detected for the channel with the immobilized hemoglobin for each concentration applied. For each measurement the resonance value that was due to buffer effects and simultaneously measured for the second channel of the sensor chip, was subtracted, and the resulting difference value was plotted against the applied concentration. The data were fitted by non-linear least squares regression with the help of the computer program Kaleidagraph (Synergy software) according the equation [P\u00b7L]=([P]<sub>t</sub>[L]<sub>t</sub>)/(K<sub>d</sub>+[P]<sub>t</sub>) whereby [P]<sub>t </sub>is the total cocentration of immobilized hemoglobin in (resonance units), [L]<sub>t </sub>is the concentration of the applied mutein or ApoD, [P\u00b7L] is the concentration of the formed complex (in resonance units) and K<sub>d </sub>is the dissociation constant.</p>Two sets of control experiments were performed. First, the bacterially produced ApoD was applied instead of its mutein HbgA, and binding to hemoglobin was measured in the same manner. Second, the binding of HbgA to myoglobin (Sigma) and to bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma) was measured. For this purpose, ca. 5000 RU of myoglobin and BSA, respectively, were immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip as described above, except using 100 \u03bcg/ml solutions in 10 mM acetate pH 4.7. The binding of HbgA was then measured as before.</p>All the binding curves are depicted in FIG. 4. A value of 2.2 \u03bcM was determined as the dissociation constant for the complex of the mutein HbgA and hemoglobin, while ApoD did not show detectable binding to hemoglobin. The mutein HbgA did not show detectable binding affinity to BSA and just weak binding to myoglobin, thus reflecting the known structural relationship with hemoglobin.</p>Accordingly, these results show that the method according to the present invention allows the generation of muteins of ApoD that not only have a high binding affinity to a native protein but that also have binding specifity for such a ligand. This finding is particularly surprising because up to now ApoD has only been known to bind low molecular weight ligands in a non-covalent manner but not to bind another protein (Vogt and Skerra, supra).</p>"
