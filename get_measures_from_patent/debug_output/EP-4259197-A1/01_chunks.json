    "t immunogenicity study. S2 served as a control that lacked strongly neutralizing epitopes whereas trimeric spike was used as a control given that it best represented the natural configuration of this viral protein. \n<!-- EPO <DP n=\"173\"/>-->\n[00415] The three spike variants were analysed by SDS-PAGE followed by SYPRO Ruby staining (Fig. 28c) and western blot using mouse immune serum raised against a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein purchased from Sino Biological (Fig. 28d). Total protein staining using SYPRO dye showed S1S2 protein to consist of several bands, including two closely migrating major bands at the 150 kDa position, as well as two smaller bands at 75 kDa and 50 kDa (Fig. 28c). All four bands were recognized by spike-specific antibodies in western blot (Fig. 28d), confirming that they were all or parts of the spike protein. Among the two bands at the 150 kDa position, the heavier one corresponded to a highly glycosylated full-length spike protein, whereas the lighter one was presumed to have a lighter glycosylation profile. The remaining two western blot-reactive bands were likely truncations of the full-length protein. Interestingly, analytical size exclusion chromatography data indicated that the S1S2 protein could form higher order structures (311 kDa; Fig. 32). This was larger than an expected monomer (180 kDa) and may suggest the presence of oligomers despite the absence of a trimerization domain. Functionally, the S1S2 protein bound ACE2 strongly with an EC50 value of 139.6 ng/ml (Fig. 28e) though its avidity was lower compared to trimeric spike. </p><p id=\"p0458\" num=\"0458\">[00416] Taken together, the data suggests a correctly folded spike protein that presents a functional receptor binding domain (RBD). Adopting the correct conformation is fundamentally important from an immunization standpoint since potently neutralizing antibodies typically target the RBD, though other regions of the spike protein have also been reported. Viral antigens (spike trimer, S2 and S1S2 protein) and CpG adjuvant were separately encapsulated in individual vesicles as ACM-trimer, ACM-S2, ACM-S1S2 and ACM-CpG, respectively. Vesicles were extruded to within 100-200 nm diameter range followed by dialysis to remove the solvent, nonencapsulated antigens and adjuvant. The final vaccine formulation was a 50:50 v/v mixture of ACM-S1S2 and ACM-CpG prior to administration. All samples were tested negative for endotoxin using colorimetric HEK Blue cell-based assay (Fig. 33). </p><p id=\"p0459\" num=\"0459\">[00417] The sizes and morphologies of ACM-antigen and ACM-CpG were assessed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and cryogenic-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), respectively. Overall, the sizes of ACM polymersomes were uniform (Fig. 28f) and followed a unimodal intensity-weighted distribution with a mean z-average hydrodynamic diameter of 158\u00b125 nm. The sizes of the different ACM- antigen preparations were comparable - ACM-trimer: 133 nm (PDI 0.192); ",
    " all ACM-preparations were dialyzed. A parallel dialysis experiment with free protein control was performed to determine the quantity of free protein remaining in each ACM preparation. SYPRO staining showed 19.8 pg/ml free trimer, 7.5 pg/ml free S1S2 protein and 0 pg/ml free S2 remaining after dialysis from 100 pg/ml starting protein concentrations (Fig. 34a-c), indicating that majority of the non-encapsulated proteins were removed from ACM-S1S2 and ACM-S2 preparations, whereas close to 40% free protein still remained with the ACM-trimer sample. The lower efficiency of trimer removal may be caused by its larger size relative to S1S2 or S2, thus reducing its diffusion across the dialysis membrane. To quantify the concentration of CpG encapsulated in ACM vesicles, the DNA binding dye SYBR Safe was used. Based on the 530 nm fluorescent emission, the encapsulation of ACM-CpG was determined to be 480 pg/ml at an efficiency of 60%. </p><p id=\"p0461\" num=\"0461\">[00419] Given the importance of shelf life and product stability in the context of local and global distribution, a stability study was performed on free S1S2 protein, ACM-S1S2, free CpG, ACM-CpG, free S1S2 + free CpG and ACM-S1S2 + ACM-CpG at 4 \u00b0C and 37 \u00b0C. The initial observation showed a very stable vesicle with no change of size and PDI of the ACM-S1S2 formulation, no degradation of S1S2 protein content, and minimal loss of activity for up to 20 weeks at 4\u00b0C measured by DLS, SDS-PAGE followed by SYPRO staining, and ACE2 binding assay by ELISA, respectively (Fig. 35a-d). However, an accelerated stability study at 37\u00b0C showed a decrease in protein concentration for both free S1S2 as well as ACM-S1S2 after one week (Fig. 36a), \n<!-- EPO <DP n=\"175\"/>-->\nindicating proteolytic degradation at elevated temperature. Unexpectedly, samples containing CpG (either ACM-S1S2 + ACM-CpG or free S1S2 + free CpG) exhibited reduced protein degradation. Further, only ACM-S1S2 + ACM-CpG maintained its protein content for up to 28 days, whereas other formulations showed complete proteolysis (Fig. 36a). It remained unclear how CpG was able to maintain protein stability at 37\u00b0C, though it was speculated that the negatively charged CpG may possibly associate with proteases present as impurities in the S1S2 sample, thereby hindering proteolysis of S1S2 protein. In contrast, the size and PDI of the ACM formulations remained stable over the 28-day time course (Fig. 36b, c). </p><p id=\"p0462\" num=\"0462\">[00420] In summary, functional SARS-CoV-2 spike (\u201cS1S2\u201d) protein from T.ni cells were expressed and purified that bound ACE2 with high avidity. This suggested a correctly folded protein, which was necessary for the induction of neutralizing antibodies. The protein and CpG adjuvant were separately encapsulated in ACM- polymersomes for the purpose of co-administration in the final vaccine formulation. In stability tests, the ACM-encapsulated S1S2 protein quickly degraded at 37 \u00b0C but remained intact for at least 20 weeks "
