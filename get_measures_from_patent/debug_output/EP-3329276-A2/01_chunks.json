Random mutagenesis of CDR and/or framework residues is described by: \n\n Barbas et al. Proc Nat. Acad. Sci, USA 91 :3809-3813 (1994); Schier et al. Gene 169: 147-155 (1996); Yelton et al. J. Immunol. 155: 1994-2004 (1995); Jackson et al, J. Immunol. </p>154(7):3310-9 (1995); and Hawkins et al. J. Mol. Biol. 226: 889-896 (1992). </p>[00109] The phrase \"substantially similar,\" or \"substantially the same,\" as used herein, denotes a sufficiently high degree of similarity between two numeric values (generally one associated with an antibody of the invention and the other associated with a </p>reference/comparator antibody) such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of little or no biological and/or statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by said values. </p> [00110] \"Binding affinity\" generally refers to the strength of the sum total of noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g., an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, \"binding affinity\" refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1 : 1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., antibody and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (Kd). Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art, including those described herein. Low-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to dissociate readily, whereas high-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain bound longer. A variety of methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art, any of which can be used for purposes of the present invention. </p>[00111] The term \"variable\" in connection with antibodies or immunoglobulins refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called hypervariable regions both in the light chain and the heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework regions (FRs). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FRs, largely adopting a \u03b2-sheet configuration, connected by three hypervariable regions, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the \u03b2-sheet structure. The hypervariable regions in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FRs and, with the hypervariable regions from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies (",
    "tal myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the selective culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT medium), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells. </p> [00183] In certain embodiments, fusion partner myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level production of antibody by the selected antibody- producing cells, and are sensitive to a selective medium that selects against the unfused parental cells. In certain embodiments, myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines, such as those derived from MOPC-21 and MPC-11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif. USA, and SP-2 and derivatives e.g., X63-Ag8-653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va., USA. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor, J. Immunol, 133:3001 (1984); and Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987)). </p> [00184] Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. In certain embodiments, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). </p> [00185] The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis described in Munson et al, Anal. Biochem, 107:220 (1980). Once hybridoma cells that produce antibodies of the desired specificity, affinity, and/or activity are identified, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, pp. 59- 103 (Academic Press, 1986)). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, D- MEM or RPMI-1640 medium. In addition, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as \n\n ascites tumors in an animal e.g., by i.p. injection of the cells into mice. The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium, ascites fluid, or serum by conventional antibody purification procedures such as, for example, affinity chromatography (e.g., using protein A or protein G-Sepharose) or ion-exchange </p>chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, etc. </p>[00186] DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The hybridoma cells serve as a source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA",

See Figs. 1 A and B. It has been shown to bind with high affinity to \u03b14\u03b27 (Kd of about 116 pM) and \u03b1\u0395\u03b27 (Kd of about 1800 pM). </p> [00279] This recombinant antibody has two heavy chains (446 residues) and two light chains (214 residues) that are covalently linked by interchain and intrachain disulfide bonds typical of IgGl antibodies. For the work described herein, it was produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The molecular mass of the intact, non glycosylated rhuMAb Beta7 molecule was approximately 144 kDa. Each heavy chain of rhuMAb Beta7 has one conserved N linked glycosylation site at Asn297. The oligosaccharides present at this site were typical of those observed in recombinant antibodies expressed in CHO cells, with the predominant glycoforms being the asialo, biantennary GO, and Gl glycans. The mass of the most prevalent rhuMAb Beta7 form containing two GO glycans and no C terminal lysine residues was approximately 147 kDa. </p> [00280] RhuMAb Beta7 drug product and placebo were prepared by Genentech. They were clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to slightly yellow aqueous solutions. Both solutions were sterile and preservative-free liquid intended for IV and SC administration. \n\n Study Design </p> Description of the Study </p> [00281] This Phase II study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety across two rhuMAb Beta7 dose levels compared with placebo in patients with moderate to severe UC. The primary efficacy endpoint was evaluated at Week 10 (2 weeks after the final dose of study drug was adm"
