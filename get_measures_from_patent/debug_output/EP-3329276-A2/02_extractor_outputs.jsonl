{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n[00278] RhuMAb Beta7 (etrolizumab) is a humanized monoclonal antibody based on the human IgGl subgroup III VH, K subgroup-I VL consensus sequences and is directed specifically against the \u03b27 subunit of the integrin heterodimer. See Figs. 1 A and B. It has been shown to bind with high affinity to \u03b14\u03b27 (Kd of about 116 pM) and \u03b1\u0395\u03b27 (Kd of about 1800 pM)."}
