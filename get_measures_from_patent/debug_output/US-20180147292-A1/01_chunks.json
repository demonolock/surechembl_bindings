    "c agent include carboplatin, cisplatin, gemcitabine, irinotecan (CPT-11), paclitaxel, pemetrexed, sorafenib, vinblastin, the agents described in International Publication No. WO2003/038043, and further, LH-RH analogs (leuprorelin, goserelin, etc.), estramustine-phosphate, estrogen antagonists (tamoxifen, raloxifene, etc.), and aromatase inhibitors (anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane, etc.). However, the type of the cancer therapeutic agent is not limited, as long as it is an agent having antitumor activity.</p>The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may also be provided in the form of a freeze-dried preparation or a liquid preparation. When the present pharmaceutical composition is provided as a freeze-dried preparation, it may be a preparation comprising suitable preparation additives that are used in the concerned technical field. Also, when the present pharmaceutical composition is provided as a liquid preparation, it may be a preparation comprising suitable preparation additives that are used in the concerned technical field.</p>The composition of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention and the concentration of an active ingredient thereof are changed depending on an administration method. In the case of the antibody-drug conjugate composition comprised in the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention, as the affinity of the antibody-drug conjugate for the antigen is increased, namely, as the affinity is increased in terms of the dissociation constant (Kd value) of the antibody-drug conjugate to the antigen (i.e., as the Kd value is decreased), the antibody-drug conjugate composition is able to exhibit medicinal effects, although it is administered in a small amount. Accordingly, for determination of the applied dose of the antibody-drug conjugate composition, the dose can be determined based on the condition of the affinity of the antibody-drug conjugate for the antigen. When the antibody-drug conjugate composition produced by the production method of the present invention is administered to a human, the present antibody-drug conjugate composition may be administered, for example, at a dose of approximately 0.001 to 100 mg/kg to the human, once, or divided over several administrations, at intervals of once per 1 to 180 days.</p>The present invention will be specifically described in the following Examples. However, these examples are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. In addition, the following Examples are not restrictively interpreted in any sense. Moreover, the reagents, solvents and starting materials described in the present description can be easily acquired from commercially available supply sources, unless otherwise specified.</p>EXAMPLES(Example 1) Construction of Humanized Anti-TROP2 Antibody Expression Vector and Production of Antibody(i) Construction of Humanized Anti-TROP2 Antibody Heavy Chain (hTINA1-H1) Expression Vector</p>A DNA fragment comprising a DNA sequence encoding the variable region of a humanized anti-TROP2 antibody heavy chain (hTINA1-H1) tha"
