Compounds were modelled into 2Fo-Fc electron density maps using AFITT-CL (version 2.1.0, OpenEye Scientific Software, Inc., Santa Fe, NM, USA.) Model building and real space refinement was done with COOT (Murshudov GN, Vagin AA, &amp; Dodson EJ (1997), Refinement of macromolecular structures by the maximum-likelihood method, Acta crystallographica. Section D, Biological crystallography 53(Pt 3):240-255) reciprocal space refinement against the calculated data was done with Refmac5, as implemented in the CCP4 suite (Murshudov GN, et al.

Final structure validation was done with procheck/sfcheck (Wlodek S, Skillman AG, &amp; Nicholls A (2006), Automated ligand placement and refinement with a combined force field and shape potential, Acta crystallographica, Section D, Biological crystallography 62(Pt 7):741 -749). </p>[00132] Isothermal titration calorimetry </p> [00133] ITC experiments for the determination of the dissociation constant Kd were done with a Microcal VP-ITC microcalorimeter (GE Healthcare) at 25 \u00b0C using ligand concentrations between 10 and 50 \u03bc\u039c in the sample cell and BRD4 concentrations between 120 and 600 \u03bc\u039c in the injection syringe. Data were obtained in discrete titration experiments with an injection volume of 12 \u03bc\u0399 per injection. Subsequently, the heats per injection were calculated as integrals and after normalization against the molar concentrations plotted against the molar ratio as implemented in Microcal Origin. Finally, data were fitted according to a single set of sites binding \n<img id=\"imgf000026_0001\" path=\"imgf000026_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/279801558/WO/20141023/A1/002014/17/03/50/imgf000026_0001.tif\"/>\n </p> as function to calculate the overall sum of heat of the titration and with (2) AQ( = (2( +f x (^ ^) - Q - D </p> (According to Microcal's manual \"ITC Data Analysis in Origin\" (September 1998)) as function describing the sum of heat of each individual injection. A correction term was included to compensate for displacement of volume of the sample cell in the course of subsequent injections according to the manufacturer's manual \"ITC Data Analysis in Origin\" (Microcal). </p>[00135] The dissociation constant Kd is commonly used to describe the affinity </p> between a ligand L and a protein, i.e. how tightly a ligand binds to a particular protein. The dissociation constant has molar units which correspond to the concentration of ligand at which the binding site on a \n\n particular protein is half occupied, i.e. the concentration of the ligand at which the concentration of protein with ligand bound equals the </p> concentration of protein with no ligand bound. The smaller the dissociation constant, the higher the affinity between ligand and protein. </p> [00136] For the compound of formula (4) the dissociation constant Kd for BRD4- BD1 was determined to be 0.3 \u03bc\u039c whereas the respective value for the compound of formula (3) with R5 being methyl was 20 \u03bc\u039c. The compound of formula (4) thus showed an improved affinity compared to the </p> compound of formula (3) with R5 being methyl. </p> [00137] The concentration required to reduce the population of a culture of HL-60 cells by 50% (GI50) was 14 \u03bc\u039c for the compound of formula (4). </p> [00138] Bromodomain profiling </p> [00139] Bromodomain profiling was carried out on the basis of BROMOscan\u2122. </p> This platform accounted for the indirect determination of the dissociation constants between 19 bromodomains and the compound of formula (4), by binding competition against a reference immobilized ligand. </p> [00140] The overall structure of the complex of the compound of formula (4) and</p>BRD4-BD1 revealed the already well-characterized bromodomain fold with a bundle of four a-helices, interconnected by three loops of different length. The termini of the helices bundle are flanked by elongational loops, which tightly pack against the protein core producing a compact and rather rigid structure. </p> [00141 ] The compound of formula (4) is bound in a pocket located at the end of the longitudinal axis running through the helix bundle which points towards the N-terminus. Consequently, it occupies the same pocket as the native Kac substrate. </p> [00142] Moreover, it mimics the ac interaction with BRD4-BD1 by positioning the 4-acyl substitution in the p",
    "thogonal orientation of both aromatic systems is created withTrp81 directly pointing towards the centre of the phenyl moiety of the compound of formula (4). Such interactions have already been reported in other drug- protein interactions. In addition, Leu92 serves as lid from the opposing side and together with Trp81 it forms a special configuration which will be referred to hereinafter as WL trap. </p> [00145] The compound of formula (3) with R5 being a methyl group represents a shortened fragment of the compound of formula (4) lacking the </p> phenylsulphonamide extension, and consequently, it perfectly fits into the site around Asn140 and the conserved waters; yet it fails to establish the interaction with the WL trap. </p> [00146] It appears that the WL trap adds to the specificity of the binding. Notably, both Trp81 and Leu92 are conserved within the BET bromodomain family. </p> [00147] The target selectivity of the compound of formula (4) within the human BRD family was assessed by means of BROMOscan\u2122. The binding of the compound to at least one representative protein of each BRD family was assessed. The results are summarized in Figure 1. </p> [00148] Figure 1 shows the selectivity profile of the compound of formula (4) within the human BRD family. Sphere size and colour indicate the binding affinity of the compound of formula (4) to the specific BRDs, as observed in the BROMOscan\u2122 assay. Additionally, binding to PB1 -BD4 was assessed by \n\n local ITC measurements. The dissociation constant (Kd) corresponding to each BRD in complex with the compound of formula (4) is indicated. The sequence similarity-based phylogenetic tree of the BRD family was extracted from the profiling visualization tool TREEspo/\u2122 and reproduced under permission of DiscoveRx Corp. The reproducible value of the dissociation constant (Kd) of the compound of formula (4) in complex with BRD4-BD1 was shown to be 0.16 \u03bc\u039c (n = 2) in terms of this assay, in close agreement with the 0.3 \u03bc\u039c observed by ITC measurements (n = 5). </p>[00149] In the BROMOscan\u2122 assay, the compound of formula (4) was found to bind specifically to the BET bromodomain family. It exhibited affinity values in the nM range for 3 members, namely BRD2-BD1 and both BRDs of BRD3, and low \u03bc\u039c affinity to the other members (Kd values between 1 .5 and 3.5 \u03bc\u039c). </p> [00150] So far, no molecules exhibiting binding selectivity within the BET family have been reported, probably due to the similarity of their binding pockets, both in terms of 3-dimensional structure and amino acid sequence. A recent classification of the BRD family pointed out that the CREBBP and EP300 BRDs had binding site amino acid signatures in common with the BET bromodomains. Indeed, the compound of formula (4) showed -3.5 \u03bc\u039c binding affinity to these two other BRDs. This result is remarkable, as only a few small molecules displaying significant binding to those proteins have been described so far. In the case of CREBBP, the compound ischemin (Kd = 19 \u03bc\u039c) was found to inhibit its association with p53, further blocking apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. </p> [00151 ] Antiproliferative activity against leukaemia cells </p> [00152] BRD4 is a validated therapeutic target in NUT midline carcinoma and in acute myeloid and MLL-fusion leukaemia. The proliferation inhibition potential of the virtual screening hits in HL-60 and HeLa cell lines for the compound of formula (4) was assessed. The compound of formula (4) exhibited a GI50 value between 5 and 20 \u03bc\u039c in HL-60 cells and no antiproliferative activity against HeLa at a high concentration of 50 \u03bc\u039c. </p> [00153] The antiproliferative potential of the compound of formula (4) was also \n\n assessed by means of the NCI-60 DTP Human Tumour Cell Line Screen. This assay consisted of 56 cell lines representing 9 different cancer types. The results are summarized in Fig. 2. </p> [00154] Fig. 2 shows a NCI-60 DTP Human Tumour Cell Line Screen. Part A shows the growth inhibition (Gl, %) observed after incubation of each cell line with the compound of formula (4) at a concentration of 10 \u03bc\u039c. Part B shows a box plot representation of the proliferation inhibition (%) of the cell lines grouped by cancer type. The compound of formula (4) showed potent and selective activity against the leukaemia cell lines represented in the assay. Indeed, the most sensitive cells were HL-60(TB) and SR, from the leukaemia panel, whereas the most resistant were OVCAR-5 and COLO 205, from ovarian and colon cancer",

QED scores indicate that the \n\n four molecules are drug-beauty, with the compound of formula (4) and JQ1 having the lowest values in the range of 0.4. LE has proven useful in the estimation of the potency of a compound to disrupt a protein-protein complex (Wells JA &amp; McClendon CL (2007), Reaching for high-hanging fruit in drug discovery at protein-protein interfaces, Nature </p> 450(7172): 1001 -1009). It could be shown that potent inhibitors had LE values above 0.24. Interestingly, the compound of formula (4) has a LE of 0.31 , similar to that of JQ1 and l-BET. The compound of formula (3) with R5 being methyl , as a representative of the new 4-acyl pyrrole BET family inhibitors, displayed the highest ligand efficiency indexes among the studied compounds, with an LE value of 0.43 and LLE of 3.7. The analysis of the drug-likeness and physicochemical properties of the compound of formula (4) and the compound of formula (3) with R5 being methyl indicate that the 4-acyl pyrrole moiety is an interesting scaffold for the development of molecules binding to the BET bromodomains. </p>[00157] Table 1 </p> [00158] Summary of drug-likeness and ligand efficiency index parameters </p> computed for compound of formula (4), compound of formula (3), JQ1 , and l-BET. pKd, quantitative estimate of drug-likeness (QED), ligand efficiency (LE, calculated as 1 ,37(pKd/number of heavy atoms), kcal-moM-heavy atom-<sup>1</sup>), and ligand-lipophilicity efficiency (LLE, calculated as pKd - dogPo/w) are shown </p> [00159] </p><img id=\"imgf000031_0001\" path=\"imgf000031_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/279801563/WO/20141023/A1/002014/17/03/50/imgf000031_0001.tif\"/></p> [00160] Toxicity screening of compound (4) </p> [00161] A single dose of the compound of formula (4) at 2000 mg/kg did not </p> induce any signs of toxicity. The value of LD50 of the substance for mice \n\n (male and female) is higher than 2000 mg/kg of body weight. All studied organs and tissues had the structure characteristics and relative body weights for normal animals. </p> [00162] Example 2 - Affinity profiling for compound of formula (3) with R5 being methyl in the human bromodomain family </p> [00163] Bromodomain profiling was carried out on the basis of BROMOscan\u2122, which is a leading platform for identifying small molecule bromodomain inhibitors. BROMOscan\u2122 employs a proprietary ligand binding site- directed competition assay to quantitatively measure interactions between test compounds and bromodomains. The reliable assay panel is suitable for high-throughput screening and delivers quantitative ligand binding data. </p> [00164] Compounds that bind the bromodomain prevent its binding to the </p> immobilized ligand thus reducing the amount of protein captured. </p> Conversely, molecules that do not bind the bromodomain have no effect on the amount of protein captured.
