The text appears to be focused on methods and descriptions of treatments, rather than providing specific data on bioactivity metrics."}
{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that meet the criteria of containing all four components: a specific molecule name, ID or other identifier, a bioactivity metric (IC50, Ki, Kd, EC50 and their variations), a specific numeric value for that metric, and a unit for that value. The text snippet provided appears to describe methods and techniques for treating and identifying patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but does not include specific bioactivity metrics with numeric values and units."}
{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that meet the specified criteria in the provided text snippet. The text appears to be descriptive of terms and concepts related to HER inhibitors, EGFR mutations, and other biological molecules, but it does not include specific numeric values with units for bioactivity metrics such as IC50, Ki, Kd, or EC50."}
