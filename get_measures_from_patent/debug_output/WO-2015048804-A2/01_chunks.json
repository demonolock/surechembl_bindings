In some embodiments, \"treatment\" could be \"phamaceutical composition\", \"medicament\" or \"agent\" that could comprise a HER inhibitor such as anti-HER3 antibody. In some embodiments, \"treatment\" could be a \"chemotherapy, \"immune therapy, \"immunotherapy\" or \"radiotherapy\". </p>[0084] As used herein, \"EGFR mutation\" means any mutation in an EGFR gene. \"EGFR mutation\" can be, for example, an EGFR exon 19 deletion and/or an exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutation. However, \"EGFR mutation\" is not limited thereto. \n\n [0085] As used herein, \"HER\" is one selected from the group consisting of HER1 (EGFR), HER2, HER3 and HER4. </p>[0086] As used herein, \"HER3\" means the human protein encoded by the gene identified by Entrez Gene ID No. 2065, and allelic variants thereof. </p>[0087] As used herein, \"HER inhibitor\" means a molecule (small molecule or macromolecule, e.g., an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof) that inhibits, neutralizes, prevents or eliminates at least a portion of the biological activity of a HER. Preferably, a HER inhibitor binds to the HER. However, \"HER inhibitor\" can be a molecule that does not directly bind to the HER, as long as said molecule inhibits, neutralizes, prevents or eliminates at least a portion of the biological activity of the HER. Examples of HER1 inhibitors (EGFR inhibitor) include lapatinib, erlotinib, cetuximab, gefitinib, afatinib, dacomitinib, panitumumab and KD-019. Examples of HER2 inhibitors include trastuzumab, pertuzumab and trastuzumab emtansine (T- DM1). </p>[0088] As used herein, \"HER3 inhibitor\" means a molecule (small molecule or macromolecule, e.g., an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof) that inhibits, neutralizes, prevents or eliminates at least a portion of the biological activity of HER3. Preferably, the HER3 inhibitor binds to HER3. However, \"HER3 inhibitor\" can be a molecule that does not directly bind to HER3, as long as said molecule inhibits, neutralizes, prevents or eliminates at least a portion of the biological activity of HER3. The effect on \"biological activity\" can be direct or indirect, such as downstream signal transduction and heterodimerization with other HER family molecules such as EGFR, HER2 and HER4. For example, the HER3 inhibitor can be an inhibitor of EGFR/HER3, HER2/HER3 or HER4/HER3 heterodimerization, or an inhibitor of a signal transduction derived from any of these heterodimerizations. In this context, \"HER3 inhibitor\" can include, for example pertuzumab, nimotuzumab, MM-111 and cetuximab. Further, without being bound by theory it is believed that HER3 forms a heterodimer with non-HER receptors, such as MET (c-MET). Thus, in some embodiments \"HER3 inhibitor\" can include, for example, a MET inhibitor such as onartuzumab and/or tivantinive. \n\n [0089] As used herein, \"HRG\" (also known as neuregulin-1, NRG1, heregulin, and HRG1) means the human protein encoded by the gene identified b",

For example, the antibody can be administered at about 9 mg/kg or more, about 12 mg/kg or more, about 15 mg/kg or more, or about 18 mg/kg or more. In some embodiments, the antibody can be administered at about 9 mg/kg or less, about 12 mg/kg or less, about 15 mg/kg or less, or about 18 mg/kg or less. </p>[0189] The anti-HER3 antibody can be administered by any suitable method. For example, in some embodiments the antibody is administered intravenously. However, the administration route is not limited to the intravenous one, but can be any other suitable one as well. </p>[0190] In some embodiments, the anti-HER3 antibody is administered one or more times every week or more frequently, or, every two weeks, or every three weeks, or less frequently. </p>[0191] In some embodiments, the treatment comprises administering an anti-HER3 antibody in combination with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor or HER inhibitor, such as an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor. The treatment can comprise administering an anti-HER3 antibody in combination with, for example, one or more of trastuzumab, T-DM1, lapatinib, pertuzumab, cetuximab, panitumumab gefitinib, afatinib, dacomitinib, KD-019 and erlotinib. </p>[0192] In some embodiments, the treatment comprises administering an anti-HER3 antibody in combination with a chemotherapy. The treatment can comprise administering an anti-HER3 antibody in combination with, for example, one or more of such as cisplatin, 5-fluoruracil, paclitaxel, capecitabine, and other chemotherapies. \n\n [0193] In some embodiments, the treatment comprises administering an anti-HER3 antibody in combination with both a tyrosine kinase inhibitor or HER inhibitor and chemotherapy. The treatment can comprise administering an anti-HER3 antibody in combination with, for example, one or more of trastuzumab, T-DMl, lapatinib, pertuzumab, cetuximab, panitumumab, gefitinib, dacomitinib, KD-019, afatinib, dacomitinib, KD-019 and erlotinib, and one or more of cisplatin, carboplatin, gemcitabine, permetrexed, irinotecan, 5-fluoruracil, paclitaxel, docetaxel, capecitabine, and other chemotherapies. </p>[0194] In some embodiments, the treatment comprises administering an anti-HER3 antibody in combination with radiotherapy. In some embodiments, treatment comprises administering an anti-HER3 antibody in combination with radiotherapy and one or more of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, HER inhibitor, and chemotherapy. </p>[0195] In some embodiments, anti-HER3 antibodies can be administered in combination with first-line treatments for metastatic or locally advanced head and neck cancer, such as radiotherapy or radiation therapy, cetuximab, cisplatin, and/or 5-fluoruracil. </p>[0196] In some embodiments, anti-HER3 antibodies can be administered in combination with first-line treatments for metastatic or locally advanced head and neck cancer, such as cetuximab, cisplatin, and/or 5-fluoruracil. </p>[0197] In some embodiments, anti-HER3 antibodies can be administered in combination with first-line treatments for NSCLC, such as erlotinib or platinum-based chemotherapy. </p>[0198] In some embodiments, anti-HER3 antibodies can be administered in combination with second-line treatments for NSCLC, such as docetaxel. </p>[0199] In some embodiments, anti-HER3 antibodies can be administered in combination with treatments for RAS wild-type cancer colorectal cancer and other cancer, such as cetuximab, panitumumab, "
