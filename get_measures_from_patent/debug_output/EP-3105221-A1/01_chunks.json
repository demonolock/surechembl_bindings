    "Soc. 2008, 130, 6025-6039). For the MRI imaging of thrombosis a Gadolinium dose of 30 \u03bc\u03b7\u03b7\u03bf\u0399 Gd/kg bodyweigh (7.5 \u03bc\u03b7\u03b7\u03bf\u0399 EP2104R/kg bw) t is used. </p> Although the principle of associating a target specific binder (biovector) and a paramagnetic chelate has been known for quite some time, a specific MRI contrast agent has not yet been tested in clinical trials. </p> The targeting MRI approach does however present some difficulties. The main difficulty arises from the relatively low sensitivity of the MRI technique. Due to the intrinsically low sensitivity of MRI, high local concentrations of the contrast agent at the target site are required to generate detectable MR contrast. The detection limit of clinical available contrast agents is around 20 \u03bc\u03b7\u03b7\u03bf\u0399 Gd/L for in vitro and preclinical animal testing (Ciesienski et.al., Curr Cardiovasc Imaging Rep. 2010, 4(1 ), 77-84) and 125 \u03bc\u03b7\u03b9\u03bf\u0399 Gd/L for robust clinical application (Caravan et. al. Chem. Soc. Rev., 2006, 35, 512-523). </p> One approach to fulfill this requirement is to increase the relaxivity or the Gadolinium content per molecule. </p>In WO2004/1 12839 is stated on p. 9, 1 .10-15 that \"the inventors went against the technical bias according to which it is preferable to use small molecules for specific medical imaging products. In fact, they were able to note that the steric hindrance of the HR chelate used does not impair the affinity of the specific product for its target. Despite a molecule weight of the order of 8 to 20 kD, the product effectively reaches its specific targeting site.\" </p>It now has been found, that the compound of the present invention have high relaxivities and high affinities for the GPIIbllla target despite the steric hindrance of the large Gadolinium chelate label. </p> The surprising technical effect of the compounds of the present invention is their potential for a significant dose reduction. </p>This surprising effect was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging experiments. The used concentrations of the high affinity binders of the present invention were significantly lower (order of magnitudes) than the used clinical standard dose. The used standard dose of established contrast agents is 100 \u03bc\u03b7\u03b7\u03bf\u0399 Gd/kg bodyweight which leads to an average plasma concentration of about 590 \u03bc\u03b7\u03b7\u03bf\u0399 Gd/L 2 min post application (summary of product characteristics: Gadovist 1.0 mmol/ml solution for injection, Fachinformation Gadovist<sup>\u00ae</sup> 1 ,0 \n\n mmol/ml Injektionslosung). The used plasma concentration of the described compounds (0.8 \u03bc\u03b7\u03b7\u03bf\u0399 Gadolinium/L) was in the order of magnitudes lower that the approved market products.</p>The surprising effect of using extremely low doses was confirmed in an in vivo monkey experiment, (total dose: 4 \u03bc\u03b7\u03b7\u03bf\u0399 Gd/ kg bodyweight equals 0.5 \u03bc\u03b7\u03b7\u03bf\u0399 molecule/kg bw) </p>The dosage was in an at least 7.5-fold up to 25-fold lower compared to the most advanced preclinical thrombus specific imaging MRI experiments described by Klink et. al. (100 \u03bc\u03b7\u03b7\u03bf\u0399 Gd/kg",
    "cific binding of <sup>3</sup>H- reference compound wells without glycoprotein receptors were used as negative controls (n=12, identically treated just without GPIIb/llla receptors). </p> After one hour the plate was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (200 \u03bc\u0399_ per well, Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline (D-PBS (+)), GIBCO<sup>\u00ae</sup>, Invitrogen). Following 140 \u03bc\u0399_ of liquid scintillation cocktail (MicroScint\u2122 40 aqueous, Perkin Elmer) was added to each well. After 15 min at room temperature the plates were measured at the microplate scintillation counter (TopCount NXT v2.13, Perkin Elmer, Packard Instrument Company). </p>Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of GPIIb/llla assay. In the first step human glycoprotein llb/llla, which is purified from human platelets, was immobilized on a 96-well solid plate. After 48 hours at least the plates were washed and the unspecific binding sites were blocked with Roti<sup>\u00ae</sup>-Block. 2. In the next step, the plates were simultaneously incubated with a tritium labeled reference compound and the novel small molecule compound (inhibitor). 3. The higher the affinity of the inhibitor, the smaller is the bound fraction of reference compound. The fraction of tritiated reference compound, which is not displaced by inhibitor, was measured at a microplate scintillation counter. The higher the affinity of the inhibitor, the smaller is the bound fraction of tritium-labeled reference compound. By means of this assay the affinities (IC50 values) could be determined. The studies described above \n\n indicate that compounds of formula (I) are useful as contrast agents for the imaging of thrombi. The results are summarized in table 1 . </p>Table 1 : Binding affinity of compounds towards human GPIIb/llla receptor. \n\n </p>Example 3 </p> Binding of investigated compounds to human activated platelets </p> For each experiment fresh blood was taken from a volunteer using 10 mL citrate-tubes (Sarstedt S-Monovette 02.1067.001 , 10 mL, Citrate 3.13%). The 10 mL citrate- tubes were carefully inverted 10 times to mix blood and anticoagulant. The tubes were stored in an incubator at a temperature of 37\u00b0C until centrifugation (Heraeus miniTherm CTT with integrated rotation- and turning device, turning speed: 19 rotations per minute, Heraeus Instruments GmbH, Hanau/Germany). </p> For plasma preparation tube centrifugation was carried out for 15 minutes at 181 1 g at room temperature (Eppendorf, Centrifuge 581 OR). To produce platelet-rich plasma blood was centrifuged 15 minutes at 201 g at room temperature. The tubes were stood for 30 min at room temperature to get a better separation. The separated platelet-rich plasma was finally centrifuged for further 3 min at 453 g to remove the remaining erythrocytes. The platelet-rich plasma was activated using a final concentration of 5 \u03bc\u039c Adenosindiphosphate (ADP, Sigma). The activated platelet-rich plasma was incubated 20 minutes and 3 min with different concentrations of gadolin"
