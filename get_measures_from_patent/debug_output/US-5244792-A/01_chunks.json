    " which are gB, gC, gD and gE, where gB and gD are cross-reactive between types 1 and 2.</p>It is a matter of great medical and scientific interest to provide safe and effective human vaccines against both HSV-1 and HSV-2 and, where infection has occurred, therapies for treatment of the disease.</p>One promising approach to the production of human vaccines against HSV has been the use of isolated glycoproteins, which have been shown to provide protection when injected into mice subsequently challenged with live virus. However, the availability of the Herpes Simplex glycoproteins has heretofore been primarily dependent upon the growth of the virus and the isolation of the membranous proteins. The problems of commercial production of the glycoproteins associated with the handling of a dangerous pathogen, the maintenance of the virus in cell culture, the isolation of the glycoproteins free of the viral genome or portions thereof, have substantially precluded the use of the glycoproteins as vaccines. It would therefore be desirable to provide human vaccines employing glycoproteins produced by methods other than by growth of the virus and isolation of the membranes proteins.</p>2.

    "lection; and line V shows those probes used to locate the gB2 gene (see below). The additional restriction sites used to generate these fragments are Nc, NcoI; K, KpnI; and A, AluI.</p>To locate the gB1 coding region within the EcoRI F fragment, Northern blots of poly A<sup>+</sup> mRNA isolated from HSV-1 infected Vero cells were probed with the DNA fragments indicated on the detailed map isolated from plasmids pHS106 and pHS107. When HSV-1 mRNA was probed with a 0.56 kb PstI-SalI fragment isolated from pHS106, a 3 kb mRNA was the major species detected. When the same blot was probed with a 0.49 kb NcoI fragment, which maps about 1 kb upstream from the PstI-SalI fragment, hybridization to a 3 kb mRNA, the presumptive gB1 mRNA, was also detected. This suggests that the gB1 coding sequences extend at least 1 kb to the left of the PstI-SalI fragment. The 3 kb mRNA does not extend beyond the first XhoI site downstream from the PstI-SalI fragment, since the 0.5 kb XhoI-XhoI fragment does not hybridize to this mRNA. The direction of transcription of the gB1 transcription unit is right to left (3'\u2190 5') as evidenced by hybridization of only the 5'\u21923' oriented strands of the PstI-SalI and NcoI-NcoI fragments (cloned in M13) to the 3 kb gB1 mRNA.</p>Hybrid selected translation was performed by hybridizing HSV-1 poly A<sup>+</sup> mRNA with a 3.2 kb KpnI-XhoI fragment, which encompasses the region indicated as encoding gB1. When the bound mRNA was eluted and translated in vitro, a 100 kd protein, similar in size to gB1 from HSV-1 infected Vero cells, was detected. Confirmation of the identity of the 100 kd protein was achieved by immunoprecipitation with a gB1-specific monoclonal antibody. Several other proteins were also detected by hybrid selection using the KpnI-XhoI fragment, probably the result of non-specific hybridization of mRNAs due to the high G+C content of the DNA. A similar pattern of proteins was seen when the same RNA was selected with a 3.0 kb SstI-SstI DNA fragment encoding HSV-1 glycoprotein gD, except that the 100 kd gB protein was not detected. This result indicated that gB is specific to the XhoI-KpnI fragment.</p>FIG. 3 is a restriction map of a 3.95 kb DNA fragment, which extends from a BamHI restriction site at 0.345 to an XhoI site at 0.373 map units. The open reading frame for gB1 is indicated by the box and the direction of transcription is from right to left as shown. The actual coding region covers map units 0.348 to 0.367. The DNA sequence from the BamHI site to a non-unique AluI site at nucleotide number 3640 is shown with the AluI site indicated by the (A). The restriction sites shown include B, BamHI; Bl, BalI; Bs, BstEII; K, KpnI; Nc, NcoI; P, PstI; Pv, PvuII; S, SalI; Sc, SacI, X, XhoI; Xm, Xma3. Restriction sites are not shown for the right-hand end from the AluI site to the terminal XhoI site. Potential glycosylation sites and hydrophobic anchor and signal regions (solid box) in the product gB1 protein are noted.</p>The DNA sequence was determined from the BamHI site to a non-unique AluI site at nucleotide residue number 3640 using the M13 dideoxynucleotide synthesis method of Sanger. Both DNA strands across the coding region were sequenced. The entire DNA sequence was compiled from overlapping restriction fragments such that the sequence was read across all restriction fragment joints. FIG. 4 shows the DNA sequence for gB1  (line 3); the predicted amino acid sequence for gB1 is shown below the DNA sequence (line 4).</p>It should be noted that the amino acid sequence ",
    " the 5'-end of gB1 mRNA was located at residue 188. The CAT and TATA transcriptional regulatory signals are presumptively at residues 55-62 and 125-131. Starting at the ATG at residues 438-440, there is an open reading frame of 2712 nucleotides which terminates at a TGA stop codon. Two presumptive polyadenylation signals are located in a 3'-non-coding region at residues 3166-3173 and 3409-3416.</p>The observed amino acid sequence is characteristic of a membrane protein. There is a very hydrophobic region near the carboxy terminus stretching from amino acid residue number 726 to 795, a 69-amino acid sequence which may span the membrane. At the N-terminus the first 30 amino acids are primarily hydrophobic. This hydrophobic amino acid domain precedes a region with a high concentration of charged or hydrophilic amino acids. The hydrophobic sequence at the N-terminus may serve as a secretory leader or signal sequence followed by processing signals for cleavage and removal of the secretory leader. The hydrophobic region near the C-terminus can serve as a transmembrane integration sequence for binding the protein to the cell membrane.</p>The sequence data is also suggestive that there are nine possible N-linked glycosylation sites as defined by the sequence asn-X-thr/ser (see also FIG. 3) within the hydrophilic, external domain. If the first 30 amino acids are removed by processing and each of the potential N-linked glycosylation sites are utilized with the addition of an average 2 kd of carbohydrate per site, the molecular weight of the mature protein would be approximately 123 Kd.</p>2.2 Expression of gB1 in Mammalian CellsEmploying the above DNA sequence or fragment thereof, expression was achieved as follows. The vector employed is a mammalian expression vector, referred to as psV1/dhfr. This 5.63 kb plasmid contains 2.8 kb of E. coli plasmid pBR328 sequences, including the ampicillin-resistance \u03b2-lactamase gene and the origin of replication. The vector also contains a selectable mammalian cell marker, the mouse dihydrofolate reductase cDNA gene (dhfr) (Nunberg et al., Cell (1980) 19:355) linked to the SV40 early promoter, which directs the transcription of dhfr. Additional SV40 sequences, including t antigen splice donor and splice acceptor sites and the polyadenylation sites for early transcripts, are included downstream from the dhfr gene within a 1.65 kb Bg1II-EcoRI fragment.</p>The plasmid pSV1/dhfr was constructed by first isolating the 0.4 kb BamHI-HindIII fragment encoding the SV40 origin and early promoter from plasmid pSVgt1. This SV40 fragment was then inserted into plasmid pBR328 by substituting this fragment for the small HindIII-BamHI fragment of pBR328. The dhfr cDNA gene and the SV40 splice sites and poly A sites of psV1/dhfr were derived from plasmid pSV2/dhfr (Mulligan and Berg, Mol. Cell Biol. (1981) 1:854-864). The 2.4 kb HindIII-RI fragment encoding the dhfr-SV40 sequences was excised from pSV2/dhfr and inserted into the above pBR328 plasmid by substitution for the small HindIII-RI fragment of pBR328. The details of these con",
    "id pCl/1 is a derivative of pJDB219 (Beggs, Nature (1978) 275: 104) in which the region corresponding to bacterial plasmid pMB9 in pJDB219 is replaced by pBR322 in pCl/1. The pCl/1 plasmid containing the 1187 bp gB1 insert and GAPDH promoter and terminator regions was designated pHS127A. This plasmid was then used to transform the yeast strain S. cerevisiae AB103.1 (\u03b1, pep 4-3, leu 2-3, leu 2-112, ura 3-52, his 4-580). Transformants were initially grown in 1.0 ml of leu<sup>-</sup> medium and then 50 ml of YEPD inoculated with 0.4 ml and grown further to an absorbance of 1-3 at 650 nm (12 hr). The yeast cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 2 krpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0 C. and resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA and freshly added 1.0 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.1 \u03bcg/ml pepstatin. The cells were repelleted and then resuspended in a volume equal to the packed cell volume in the same buffer. An equal volume of acid-washed glass beads (diameter 0.45-0.5 mm) was added and the yeast cells disrupted by vortexing at 4\u00b0 C. for 10 min total, using 1 min intervals.</p>The tubes were centrifuged for 15 min at 14000\u00d7g at 4\u00b0 C. and the supernatant isolated and analyzed on 10% SDS polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto nitrocellulose paper for Western analysis (Burnett, Anal. Biochemistry (1981) 112: 195). A polyclonal antibody (DAKO) to HSV-1 was employed as the primary antibody. Expression of an HSV specific protein was observed at about 44 kd, the size expected for the gB fragment.</p>3. Glycoprotein B.23.1 Isolation, cloning and characterization of the gB2 geneThe gene encoding glycoprotein B of HSV-2 had been shown to the colinear with the corresponding HSV-1 gB gene by analysis of HSV-1\u00d7HSV-2 intertypic recombinants and to lie approximately between prototypic map coordinates 0.30 and 0.42 (Ruyechan et al., J. Virol. (1979) 29: 677-697). Thus, the HindIII H fragment of HSV-2 which spans map coordinates 0.28 to 0.40 (FIG. 7) includes the gB2 coding region. FIG. 7A shows a conventional prototype HSV-2 configuration in the first two lines. The restriction map for HindIII is shown in the third line. In addition to their colinear map location, serological and heteroduplex analyses indicate the close similarity of gB1 and gB2.</p>The gene for glycoprotein gB2 was located by hybridization with specific DNA probes generated from the gB1 coding region. As a first step, a restriction map was determined for the HindIII H fragment of HSV-2 strain 333 which spans map coordinates 0.28-0.39 as shown in FIG. 7B.</p>A random library of HSV-2 strain 333 sequences cloned into the lambda vector L-47.1 (Leonen and Brammar, Gene (1980) 10: 249) (obtained from Dr. James Casey, Louisiana State University) was generated by a partial MboI digestion of the viral DNA and cloned into the BamHI site of the vector. The library was screened for plaque hybridization using a KpnI-NdeI fragment of gB1 as a probe. A positive lambda clone was pi",
    "glII) vector fragment isolated by gel electrophoresis. These two fragments (1.9 kb and 4.85 kb) were ligated together to generate pHS210--the expression plasmid (FIG. 10).</p>Plasmid pHS210 was used directly to transform COS cells. Expression was detected by immunofluorescence using a gB specific monoclonal antibody, F3 A/B, and also using a commercially available polyclonal anti HSV-2 antibody (DAKO) as the primary antibody screen. Secretion of gB2 into the medium was detected by a gB2-specific ELISA. For this purpose, plates were coated with the monoclonal antibody. Samples of cell culture medium were added to coated plates, then bound gB2 was detected with the rabbit anti HSV-2 polyclonal antibody (DAKO) followed by horseradish conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG.</p>For CHO cell transformation plasmid pHS210 was used along with a second plasmid containing dhfr as a selective marker in a cotransfection protocol. Following transfection and propagation in selective media, approximately 100 dhfr<sup>+</sup> clones were isolated and screened for synthesis and secretion of gB2 using an ELISA assay in which ELISA plates were coated with F3 A/B specific monoclonal antibody. Clone pHS210 #3-1, which had the highest levels of gB secretion, was chosen for further characterization of the gB2 polypeptide. The gB2 protein was detected by labeling with [<sup>35</sup> S]-methionine followed by immunoprecipitation. After a 1 hr pulse, diffuse doublet bands corresponding to polypeptides of 79 Kd and 84 Kd were detected intracellularly. These proteins are larger than the 68,991 dalton size predicted for the 637 residue truncated gene product, and they presumably correspond to partially glycosylated precursors. After a 5 hr chase, no gB2 was detected intracellularly, and an 89 Kd polypeptide was detected in the medium. The size of the mature, fully glycosylated gB2 secreted into the media of clone pHS210 #3-1 is somewhat smaller than the 100 Kd gB1 secreted by pHS114-6 due to the removal from pHS210 of the coding sequence for 94 amino acids included in the gB1 plasmid.</p>It is evident from the above results that oligonucleotide sequences are provided which can be used in a variety of ways. The oligonucleotide sequences may be used as probes for detecting HSV glycoprotein B or analogous proteins from other members of the herpes virus family. Furthermore, the sequences can be used for the expression of a wide variety of polypeptides, including glycoprotein B precursor, mature glycoprotein B, and the functional fragments or domains thereof, which can be joined to sequences other than the naturally occurring sequences to provide hybrid polypeptides and proteins having a wide variety of utilities. The glycoprotein produced by hybrid DNA technology can be used in a wide variety of ways, as a reagent in immunoassays, as a vaccine, as a competitor with HSV for receptor sites, and the like.</p>4. Vaccine TrialsThe utility of vaccines containing gB in protecting against herpes virus infections is illustrated below. In these studies the gB protein was produced by cloning a truncated gB gene from HSV-1 strain Patton into the plasmid pHS114 which was then used to transfect Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The truncation deletes the 194-carboxyl terminal amino acids including the hydrophobic transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic region such that the resulting protein is secreted into the culture medium rather being inser"
