    "oglobulin, or in the context of T cells, those residues necessary for recognition by T cell receptor proteins and/or Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) receptors. In an immune system setting, in vivo or in vitro, an epitope is the collective features of a molecule, such as primary, secondary and tertiary peptide structure, and charge, that together form a site recognized by an immunoglobulin, T cell receptor or HLA molecule. Throughout this disclosure epitope and peptide are often used interchangeably. It is to be appreciated, however, that isolated or purified protein or peptide molecules larger than and comprising an epitope of the invention are still within the bounds of the invention. </p> \u201cHuman Leukocyte Antigen\u201d or \u201cHLA\u201d is a human class I or class II Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) protein (see, e.g., Stites, et al., IMMUNOLOGY, 8<sup>TH </sup>ED., Lange Publishing, Los Altos, Calif. (1994). </p> An \u201cHLA supertype or family\u201d, as used herein, describes sets of HLA molecules grouped on the basis of shared peptide-binding specificities. HLA class I molecules that share somewhat similar binding affinity for peptides bearing certain amino acid motifs are grouped into HLA supertypes. The terms HLA superfamily, HLA supertype family, HLA family, and HLA xx-like molecules (where xx denotes a particular HLA type), are synonyms. </p> Throughout this disclosure, results are expressed in terms of \u201cIC<sub>50</sub>'s.\u201d IC<sub>50 </sub>is the concentration of peptide in a binding assay at which 50% inhibition of binding of a reference peptide is observed. Given the conditions in which the assays are run (i.e., limiting HLA proteins and labeled peptide concentrations), these values approximate K<sub>D </sub>values. Assays for determining binding are described in detail, e.g., in PCT publications WO 94/20127 and WO 94/03205. It should be noted that IC<sub>50 </sub>values can change, often dramatically, if the assay conditions are varied, and depending on the particular reagents used (e.g., HLA preparation, etc.). For example, excessive concentrations of HLA molecules will increase the apparent measured IC<sub>50 </sub>of a given ligand. </p> Alternatively, binding is expressed relative to a reference peptide. Although as a particular assay becomes more, or less, sensitive, the IC<sub>50</sub>'s of the peptides tested may change somewhat, the binding relative to the reference peptide will not significantly change. For example, in an assay run under conditions such that the IC<sub>50 </sub>of the reference peptide increases 10-fold, the IC<sub>50 </sub>values of the test peptides will also shift approximately 10-fold. Therefore, to avoid ambiguities, the assessment of whether a peptide is a good, intermediate, weak, or negative binder is generally based on its IC<sub>50</sub>, relative to the IC<sub>50 </sub>of a standard peptide. </p> Binding may also be determined using other assay systems including those using: live cells (e.g., Ceppellini et a",
    "pacer molecule. The spacer is typically comprised of relatively small, neutral molecules, such as amino acids or amino acid mimetics, which are substantially uncharged under physiological conditions. The spacers are typically selected from, e.g., Ala, Gly, or other neutral spacers of nonpolar amino acids or neutral polar amino acids. It will be understood that the optionally present spacer need not be comprised of the same residues and thus may be a hetero- or homo-oligomer. When present, the spacer will usually be at least one or two residues, more usually three to six residues and sometimes 10 or more residues. The CTL peptide epitope can be linked to the T helper peptide epitope either directly or via a spacer either at the amino or carboxy terminus of the CTL peptide. The amino terminus of either the immunogenic peptide or the T helper peptide may be acylated. </p> In certain embodiments, the T helper peptide is one that is recognized by T helper cells present in the majority of the population. This can be accomplished by selecting peptides that bind to many, most, or all of the HLA class II molecules. These are known as \u201cloosely HLA-restricted\u201d or \u201cpromiscuous\u201d T helper sequences. Examples of amino acid sequences that are promiscuous include sequences from antigens such as tetanus toxoid at positions 830-843 (QYIKANSKFIGITE; SEQ ID NO:67), Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite (CS) protein at positions 378-398 (DIEKKIAKMEKASSVFNVVNS; SEQ ID NO:68), and Streptococcus 18 kD protein at positions 116 (GAVDSILGGVATYGAA; SEQ ID NO:69). Other examples include peptides bearing a DR 1-4-7 supermotif, or either of the DR3 motifs. </p> Alternatively, it is possible to prepare synthetic peptides capable of stimulating T helper lymphocytes, in a loosely HLA-restricted fashion, using amino acid sequences not found in nature (see, e.g., PCT publication WO 95/07707). These synthetic compounds called Pan-DR-binding epitopes (e.g., PADRE\u2122, Epimmune, Inc., San Diego, Calif.) are designed to most preferrably bind most HLA-DR (human HLA class II) molecules. For instance, a pan-DR-binding epitope peptide having the formula: aKXVAAWTLKAAa (SEQ ID NO:70), where \u201cX\u201d is either cyclohexylalanine, phenylalanine, or tyrosine, and a is either D-alanine or L-alanine, has been found to bind to most HLA-DR alleles, and to stimulate the response of T helper lymphocytes from most individuals, regardless of their HLA type. An alternative of a pan-DR binding epitope comprises all \u201cL\u201d natural amino acids and can be provided in the form of nucleic acids that encode the epitope. </p> HTL peptide epitopes can also be modified to alter their biological properties. For example, they can be modified to include D-amino acids to increase their resistance to proteases and thus extend their serum half life, or they can be conjugated to other molecules such as lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, and the like to increase their biological activity. For example, a T helper peptide can be conjug",
    "stered as a composition comprising one or more discrete epitopes. Alternatively, the vaccine can be administered as a minigene construct or as dendritic cells which have been loaded with the peptide epitopes in vitro. </p>Example 16 Use of Peptides to Evaluate an Immune Response  Peptides of the invention may be used to analyze an immune response for the presence of specific CTL or HTL populations directed to HPV. Such an analysis may be performed in a manner as that described by Ogg et al., Science 279:2103-2106, 1998. In the following example, peptides in accordance with the invention are used as a reagent for diagnostic or prognostic purposes, not as an immunogen. </p> In this example highly sensitive human leukocyte antigen tetrameric complexes (\u201ctetramers\u201d) are used for a cross-sectional analysis of, for example, HPV HLA-A*0201-specific CTL frequencies from HLA A*0201-positive individuals at different stages of infection or following immunization using an HPV peptide containing an A*0201 motif. Tetrameric complexes are synthesized as described (Musey et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 337:1267, 1997). Briefly, purified HLA heavy chain (A*0201 in this example) and \u03b22-microglobulin are synthesized by means of a prokaryotic expression system. The heavy chain is modified by deletion of the transmembrane-cytosolic tail and COOH-terminal addition of a sequence containing a BirA enzymatic biotinylation site. The heavy chain, \u03b22-microglobulin, and peptide are refolded by dilution. The 45-kD refolded product is isolated by fast protein liquid chromatography and then biotinylated by BirA in the presence of biotin (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.), adenosine 5\u2032triphosphate and magnesium Streptavidin-phycoerythrin conjugate is added in a 1:4 molar ratio, and the tetrameric product is concentrated to 1 mg/ml. The resulting product is referred to as tetramer-phycoerythrin. </p> For the analysis of patient blood samples, approximately one million PBMCs are centrifuged at 300 g for 5 minutes and resuspended in 50 \u03bcl of cold phosphate-buffered saline. Tri-color analysis is performed with the tetramer-phycoerythrin, along with anti-CD8-Tricolor, and anti-CD38. The PBMCs are incubated with tetramer and antibodies on ice for 30 to 60 min and then washed twice before formaldehyde fixation. Gates are applied to contain &gt;99.98% of control samples. Controls for the tetramers include both A*0201-negative individuals and A*0201-positive uninfected donors. The percentage of cells stained with the tetramer is then determined by flow cytometry. The results indicate the number of cells in the PBMC sample that contain epitope-restricted CTLs, thereby readily indicating the extent of immune response to the HPV epitope, and thus the stage of infection with HPV, the status of exposure to HPV, or exposure to a vaccine that elicits a protective or therapeutic response. </p>Example 17 Use of Peptide Epitopes to Evaluate Recall Responses  The peptide epitopes of the invention are used as reagent"
