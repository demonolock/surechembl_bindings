    "ody.</p>Preference is given to the treatment of melanoma, renal cancer, hepatocellular cancer, non small lung cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer or pancreatic cancer.</p>Angiogenesis-related conditions and disorders can also be treated with drug combinations of the present invention. Inappropriate and ectopic expression of angiogenesis can be deleterious to an organism. A number of pathological conditions are associated with the growth of extraneous blood vessels. These include, e.g., diabetic retinopathy, neovascular glaucoma, psoriasis, retrolental fibroplasias, angiofibroma, inflammation, restenosis, etc. In addition, the increased blood supply associated with cancerous and neoplastic tissue, encourages growth, leading to rapid tumor enlargement and metastasis. Moreover, the growth of new blood vessels in a tumor provides an escape route for renegade cells, encouraging metastasis and the consequence spread of the cancer.</p>Useful systems for modulating angiogenesis, include, e.g., neovascularization of tumor explants (e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,192,744; 6,024,688), chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay (e.g., Taylor and Folkman, Nature, 297:307-312, 1982; Eliceiri et al., J. Cell Biol., 140, 1255-1263, 1998), bovine capillary endothelial (BCE) cell assay (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,024,688; Polverini, P. J. et al., Methods Enzymol., 198:440-450, 1991), migration assays, and HUVEC (human umbilical cord vascular endothelial cell) growth inhibition assay (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,060,449). In addition, useful systems for modulating lymphangiogenesis, include, e.g., rabbit ear model (e.g., Szuba et al., FASEB J., 16(14):1985-7, 2002).</p>Modulation of angiogenesis can be determined by any suitable method. For example, the degree of tissue vascularity is typically determined by assessing the number and density of vessels present in a given sample. For example, microvessel density (MVD) can be estimated by counting the number of endothelial clusters in a high-power microscopic field, or detecting a marker specific for microvascular endothelium or other markers of growing or established blood vessels, such as CD31 (also known as platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule or PECAM). A CD31 antibody can be employed in conventional immunohistological methods to immunostain tissue sections as described by, e.g., Penfold et al., Br. J. Oral and Maxill. Surg., 34: 3741; U.S. Pat. No. 6,017,949; Dellas et al., Gyn. Oncol., 67:27-33, 1997; and others. Other markers for angiogenesis, include, e.g., Vezf1 (e.g., Xiang et al., Dev. Bio., 206:123-141, 1999), angiopoietin, Tie-1, and Tie-2 (e.g., Sato et al., Nature, 376:70-74, 1995).</p>The drug combinations of this invention also have a broad therapeutic activity to treat or prevent the progression of a broad array of diseases, such as inflammatory conditions, coronary restenosis, tumor-associated angiogenesis, atherosclerosis, autoimmune diseases, inflammation, certain kidne",
    ". The resin is washed with a buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 0.01% Triton X-100. The GST-tagged proteins are eluted with a solution containing 100 mM Glutathione, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 0.01% Triton X-100. The purified proteins are dialyzed into a buffer containing 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 20% Glycerol.</p>Test compounds are serially diluted in DMSO using three-fold dilutions to stock concentrations ranging typically from 50 \u03bcM to 20 mM (e.g., final concentrations in the assay can range from 1 \u03bcM to 0.4 nM). The c-Raf biochemical assay is performed as a radioactive filtermat assay in 96-well Costar polypropylene plates (Costar 3365). The plates are loaded with 75 \u03bcL solution containing 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 70 mM NaCl, 80 ng of Lck/c-Raf and 1 \u03bcg MEK-1. Subsequently, 2 \u03bcL of the serially diluted individual compounds is added to the reaction, prior to the addition of ATP. The reaction is initiated with 25 \u03bcL ATP solution containing 5 \u03bcM ATP and 0.3 \u03bcCi [33P]-ATP. The plates were sealed and incubated at 32\u00b0 C. for 1 hour. The reaction is quenched with the addition of 50 \u03bcl of 4% Phosphoric Acid and harvested onto P30 filtermats (PerkinElmer) using a Wallac Tomtec Harvester. Filtermats are washed with 1% Phosphoric Acid first and deinonized H2O second. The filters are dried in a microwave, soaked in scintillation fluid and read in a Wallac 1205 Betaplate Counter (Wallac Inc., Atlanta, Ga., U.S.A.). The results are expressed as percent inhibition.</p>% Inhibition=[100-(Tib/Ti)]\u00d7100 where</p>Tib=(counts per minute with inhibitor)\u2212(background)</p>Ti=(counts per minute without inhibitor)\u2212(background)</p>Raf activity can also be monitored by its ability to initiate the cascade leading to ERK phosphorylation (i.e., raf/MEK/ERK), resulting in phospho-ERK. A Bio-Plex Phospho-ERK1/2 immunoassay can be performed as follows:</p>A 96-well phospho-ERK (pERK) immunoassay, using laser flow cytometry platform has been established to measure inhibition of basal pERK in cell lines. MDA-MB-231 cells are plated at 50,000 cells per well in 96-well microtitre plates in complete growth media. For effects of test compounds on basal pERK1/2 inhibition, the next day after plating, MDA-MB-231 cells are transferred to DMEM with 0.1% BSA and incubated with test compounds diluted 1:3 to a final concentration of 3 mM to 12 nM in 0.1% DMSO. Cells are incubated with test compounds for 2 h, washed, and lysed in Bio-Plex whole cell lysis buffer A. Samples are diluted with buffer B 1:1 (v/v) and directly transferred to assay plate or frozen at \u221280\u00b0 C. degrees until processed. 50 mL of diluted MDA-MB-231 cell lysates are incubated with about 2000 of 5 micron Bio-Plex beads conjugated with an anti-ERK1/2 antibody overnight on a shaker at room temperature. The next day, biotinylated phospho-ERK1/2 sandwich immunoassay is performed, beads are washed 3 times during each incubation and then 50 mL of PE-strepavidin is used as a developing reagent. The relative fluorescence units of pERK1/2 is detected by counting 25 beads with Bio-Plex flow cell (probe) at high sensitivity. The IC50 is calculated by taking untreated cells as maximum and no cells (beads only) as background.</p>Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase ActivityPKI3 activity can be determined routinely, e.g., using commercially available kits (e.g., Perkin-Elmer, FlashPlate Platform), Frew et al., Anticancer Res., 14(6B):2425-8, 1994. See also, publications listed under PKI3 inhibitors.</p>Akt ActivityAKT can be isolated from insect cells expressing His-tagged AKT1 (aa 136-480) as described in WO 05011700. Expressing cells are lysed in 25 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole; pH 7.5 using a polytron (5 mls lysis buffer/g cells). Cell debris is removed by centrifuging at 28,000\u00d7 g for 30 minutes. The supernatant is filtered through a 4.5 micron filter then loaded onto a nickel-chelating column pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column is washed with 5 column volumes (CV) of lysis buffer then with 5 CV of 20% buffer B, where buffer B is 25 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole; pH 7. His-tagged AKT1 (aa 136-480) is eluted with a 20-100% linear gradient of buffer B over 10 CV. His-tagged AKTI (136-480) eluting fractions are pooled and diluted three-fold with buffer C, where buffer C is 25 mM HEPES, pH 7. The sample is then chromatographed over a Q-Sepharose HP column pre-equilibrated with buffer C. The column is washed with 5 CV buffer C, then step eluted with 5 CV 10% D, 5 CV 20% D, 5 CV 30% D, 5 CV 50% D. and 5 CV of 100% D; where buffer D is 25 mM HEPES, 1000 mM NaCl; pH 7.5.</p>His-tagge",

The method measures the ability of the isolated enzyme to catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphate from ATP onto the serine\u201472 residue of a biotinylated synthetic peptide (Biotin-ahx-ARKRERAYSFGHHA-amide). Substrate phosphorylation can be detected by the following procedure described in WO 05011700.</p>Assays are performed in 384 well U-bottom white plates. 10 nM activated AKT enzyme is incubated for 40 minutes at room temperature in an assay volume of 20 ul containing 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.5, 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 uM ATP, 8 uM peptide, 0.04 uCi [g-<sup>33</sup>P] ATP/well, 1 mM CHAPS, 2 mM DTT, and 1 \u03bcl of test compound in 100% DMSO. The reaction is stopped by the addition of 50 \u03bcl SPA bead mix (Dulbecco's PBS without Mg2+ and Ca2+, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mM EDTA, 50 \u03bcM ATP, 2.5 mg/ml Streptavidin-coated SPA beads). The plate is sealed, the beads are allowed to settle overnight, and then the plate was counted in a Packard Topcount Microplate Scintillation Counter (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, Conn.).</p>The data for dose responses can be plotted as % Control calculated with the data reduction formula 100*(U1-C2)/(C1-C2) versus concentration of compound where U is the unknown value, C1 is the average control value obtained for DIVISO, and C2 is the average control value obtained for 0.1M EDTA. Data are fitted to the curve described by: y=((Vmax*x) K+x)) where Vmax is the upper asymptote and K is the IC50.</p>Cell ProliferationAn example of a cell proliferation assay is described in the Examples below. However, proliferation assays can be performed by any suitable method. For example, a breast carcinoma cell proliferation assay can be performed as follows. Other cell types can be substituted for the MDA-MB-231 cell line.</p>Human breast carcinoma cells (MDA MB-231, NCI) are cultured in standard growth medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS at 37\u00b0 C. in 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>(vol/vol) in a humidified incubator. Cells are plated at a density of 3000 cells per well in 90 \u03bcL growth medium in a 96 well culture dish. In order to determine T<sub>0h </sub>CTG values, 24 hours after plating, 100 \u03bcL of CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Reagent (Promega) is added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. Luminescence is recorded on a Wallac Victor II instrument. The CellTiter-Glo reagent results in cell lysis and generation of a luminescent signal proportional to the amount of ATP present, which, in turn is directly proportional to the number of cells present.</p>Test compounds are dissolved in 100% DMSO to prepare 10 mM stocks. Stocks are further diluted 1:400 in growth medium to yield working stocks of 25 \u03bcM test compound in 0.25% DMSO. Test compounds are serially diluted in growth medium containing 0.25% DMSO to maintain constant DMSO concentrations for all wells. 60 \u03bcL of diluted test compound are added to each culture well to give a final volume of 180 \u03bcL. The cells with and without individual test compounds are incubated for 72 hours at which time ATP dependent luminescence was measured, as described previously, to yield T<sub>72h </sub>values. Optionally, the IC<sub>50 </sub>values can be determined with a least squares analysis program using compound concentration versus percent inhibition.</p>% Inhibition=[1\u2212(T<sub>72h text</sub>\u2212T<sub>0h</sub>)/(T<sub>72h ctrl</sub>\u2212T<sub>0h</sub>)]\u00d7100, whereT<sub>72h text</sub>=ATP dependent luminescence at 72 hours in the presence of test compoundT<sub>72h ctrl</sub>=ATP dependent luminescence at 72 hours in the absence of test compoundT<sub>0h</sub>=ATP dependent luminescence at Time Zero.</p>AngiogenesisOne useful model to study angiogenesis is based on the observation that, when a reconstituted basement membrane matrix, such as Matrigel, supplemented with growth factor (e.g., FGF-1), is injected subcutaneously into a host animal, endothelial cells are recruited into the matrix, forming new blood vessels over a period of several days. See, e.g., Passaniti et al., Lab. Invest., 67:519-528, 1992. By sampling the extract at different times, angiogenesis can be temporally dissected, permitting the identification of genes involved in all stages of angiogenesis, including, e.g., migration of endothelial cells into the matrix, commitment of endothelial cells to angiogenesis pathway, cell elongation and formation of sac-like spaces, and establishment of functional capillaries comprising connected, and linear structures containing red blood cells. To stabilize the growth factor and/or slow its release from the matrix, the growth factor can be bound to heparin or another stabilizing agent. The matrix can also be periodically re-infused with growth factor to enhance and extend the angiogenic process.</p>Other useful systems for studying angiogenesis, include, e.g., neovascularization of tumor explants (e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,192,744; 6,024,688), chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay (e.g., Taylor and Folkman, Nature, 297:307-312, 1982; Eliceiri et al., J.

No. 6,060,449).</p>The present invention provides one or more of the following features.</p>A method of treating any of the aforementioned diseases and/or conditions, comprising administering effective amounts of a compound of formula I and a second compound which is an PI3K/AKT signalling pathway inhibitor.</p>A method of modulating (e.g., inhibiting) one or more aforementioned activities, comprising administering effective amounts of a compound of formula I and a second compound which is an PI3K/AKT signalling pathway inhibitor.</p>Combinations comprising a compound of formula I and a second compound which is an PI3K/AKT signalling pathway inhibitor.</p>Without further elaboration, it is believed that one skilled in the art can, using the preceding description, utilize the present invention to its fullest extent.
