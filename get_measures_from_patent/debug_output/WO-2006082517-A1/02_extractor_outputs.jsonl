{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that contain all four required components: a specific molecule name, ID or other identifier, a bioactivity metric (IC50, Ki, Kd, EC50 and their variations), a specific numeric value for that metric, and a unit for that value. The text primarily discusses the effects of PYY3-36 on food intake and the modification of PYY3-36 with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to prolong its half-life, but it does not provide specific bioactivity metrics with numeric values and units as required."}
