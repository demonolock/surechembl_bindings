    "ecrease appetite and reduce food intake by 33% over 24 hours. Infusion of PYY<sub>3</sub>.<sub>36</sub> to reach the normal postprandial circulatory concentrations of the peptide led to peak serum levels of PYY<sub>3</sub>.<sub>36</sub> within 15 minutes, followed by a rapid decline to basal levels within 30 minutes. It was reported that there was significant inhibition of food intake in the 12-hour period following the PYY<sub>3</sub>-<sub>36</sub> infusion, but there was essentially no effect on food intake in the 12- hour to 24-hour period. In a rat study, repeated administration of PYY<sub>3</sub>.<sub>3</sub>e IP (injections twice daily for 7 days) reduced cumulative food intake (Batterham, et al., Nature 418:650-654, 2002).</p>Polypeptide-based drugs are frequently covalently attached to polymers such as polyethylene glycols to prolong their half-life in vivo. However, this often leads to a drastic loss of biological or pharmacological activity (Shechter et al., FEBS Letters 579:2439-2444, 2005; Fuerteges and Abuchowski, J.

For example, Shechter et al., supra, reported that 40 kD pegylation of PYY<sub>3</sub>.<sub>36</sub> by standard chemistry, through formation of a stable bond (40 kD PEG-PYY<sub>3</sub>.<sub>36</sub>), led to its complete inactivation in food intake studies with mice (s.c. injection). They also reported, however, that reversible pegylation of PYY3.36 (40 kD PEG-FMS-PYY<sub>3</sub>.<sub>36</sub>) resulted in an eight- fold increase in functional half-life (24 hrs vs. 3 hrs).
