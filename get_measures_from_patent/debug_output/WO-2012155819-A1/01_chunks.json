Polyclonal anti-HBsAg antibody (human HBIg, from China, Fuyang). Among them, the secondary antibody used is a goat anti-human antibody labeled with alkaline phosphatase (AP). In all experiments, all were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The results of the experiment showed that the antibody of the present invention was able to bind to HBsAg, and the binding affinity was 18526. 4 times that of the human polyclonal antibody HBIg (Fig. 6A and Table 2). Furthermore, the affinity of scFvC-hlgGlFc to HBsAg was determined to be Kd = 538 pM.

Different amounts of hlgGl were added as standard. A series of titrated concentrations of human polyclonal anti-HBsAg antibody (human HBIg, from China, Fuyang) or scFvC-hlgGlFc were then added and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Among them, the secondary antibody used is a goat anti-human antibody labeled with alkaline tyrosinase (AP). The experimental results show that the antibody of the present invention can efficiently bind to the adr and adw subtypes of HBsAg, and the binding affinity is much higher than the human polyclonal antibody HBIg (Fig. 6B). Further, as compared with the results of Example 4, it was found that the antibody of the present invention has higher affinity for HBsAg of the adr and adw subtypes than for blood-derived HBsAg. Example 6 Antibody scFVc and scFvD bind to different epitopes on HBsAg</p>Since a single monoclonal antibody treatment may not be sufficient to control the virus c"
