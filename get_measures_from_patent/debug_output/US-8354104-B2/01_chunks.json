Such binding-domain immunoglobulin fusion proteins are further disclosed in US2003/0118592 and US 2003/0133939.</p>Antibodies of the present invention preferably dissociate from GT468 with a dissociation equilibrium constant (KD) of approximately 1-100 nM or less. Preferably, antibodies of the invention do not cross-react with related cell-surface antigens and thus do not inhibit their function.</p>In preferred embodiments, antibodies of the present invention can be characterized by one or more of the following properties:\na) specificity for GT468;b) a binding affinity to GT468 of about 100 nM or less, preferably, about 5-10 nM or less and, more preferably, about 1-3 nM or less,c) the ability to mediate a high level of CDC on either CD55/59 negative or CD55/59 positive cells;d) the ability to inhibit the growth of cells which express GT468 and/or are characterized by association of GT468 with their cell surface;e) the ability to induce apoptosis of cells which express GT468 and/or are characterized by association of GT468 with their cell surface;f) the ability to induce homotypic adhesion of cells which express GT468 and/or are characterized by association of GT468 with their cell surface;g) the ability to induce ADCC of cells which express GT468 and/or are characterized by association of GT468 with their cell surface in the presence of effector cells;h) the ability to prolong survival of a subject having tumor cells which express GT468 and/or are characterized by association of GT468 with their cell surface;i) the ability to deplete cells which express GT468 and/or are characterized by association of GT468 with their cell surface;j) the ability to deplete cells which express low levels of GT468 a",
    "ellular ligand or antigen (e.g. to produce an immunoconjugate, such as an immunotoxin). An antibody of the present invention can be linked to other therapeutic moieties, e.g., a radioisotope, a small molecule anti-cancer drug, a recombinant cytokine or chemokine. Accordingly, the present invention encompasses a large variety of antibody conjugates, bispecific and multispecific molecules, and fusion proteins, all of which bind to GT468 expressing cells and/or to cells being characterized by association of GT468 with their cell surface and which can be used to target other molecules to such cells.</p>In a further aspect, the invention also envisions GT468-binding proteins derived from non-immunoglobulin domains, in particular single-chain proteins. Such binding proteins and methods for their production are described, for example, in Binz et al. (2005) Nature Biotechnology 23 (10): 1257-1268, herein incorporated by reference. It is to be understood that the teaching given herein with respect to immunoglobulin or immunoglobulin derived binding molecules correspondingly also applies to binding molecules derived from non-immunoglobulin domains. In particular, using such binding molecules derived from non-immunoglobulin domains it is possible to block GT468 of cells expressing said target and/or being characterized by association of said target with their cell surface and thus, to bring about therapeutic effects as disclosed herein for antibodies of the invention, in particular the inhibition of one or more activities of tumor cells as disclosed herein such as proliferation. Although not mandatory, it is possible to confer effector functions of antibodies to such non-immunoglobulin binding molecules by e.g. fusion to the Fc region of antibodies.</p>In still another aspect, the invention provides compositions, e.g., pharmaceutical and diagnostic compositions/kits, comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier formulated along with one or a combination of antibodies of the invention. In a particular embodiment, the composition includes a combination of antibodies which bind to distinct epitopes or which possess distinct functional characteristics, such as inducing CDC and/or ADCC and inducing apoptosis. In this embodiment of the invention, antibodies may be used in combination, e.g., as a pharmaceutical composition comprising two or more anti-GT468 monoclonal antibodies. For example, anti-GT468 antibodies having different but complementary activities can be combined in a single therapy to achieve a desired therapeutic effect. In a preferred embodiment, the composition includes an anti-GT468 antibody that mediates CDC combined with another anti-GT468 antibody that induces apoptosis. In another embodiment, the composition includes an anti-GT468 antibody that mediates highly effective killing of target cells in the presence of effector cells, combined with another anti-GT468 antibody that inhibits the growth of cells expressing GT468 and/or being characte",
    "anism not consisting of the transgenic organism, and being generally derived from a species other than the transgenic organism.</p>As used herein, a \u201cheterohybrid antibody\u201d refers to an antibody having light and heavy chains of different organismal origins. For example, an antibody having a human heavy chain associated with a murine light chain is a heterohybrid antibody.</p>The antibodies described herein are preferably isolated. An \u201cisolated antibody\u201d as used herein, is intended to refer to an antibody which is substantially free of other antibodies having different antigenic specificities (e.g., an isolated antibody that specifically binds to GT468 is substantially free of antibodies that specifically bind antigens other than GT468). An isolated antibody that specifically binds to an epitope, isoform or variant of human GT468 may, however, have cross-reactivity to other related antigens, e.g., from other species (e.g., GT468 species homologs). Moreover, an isolated antibody may be substantially free of other cellular material and/or chemicals. In one embodiment of the invention, a combination of \u201cisolated\u201d monoclonal antibodies relates to antibodies having different specificities and being combined in a well defined composition.</p>According to the invention, the term \u201cbinding\u201d preferably relates to \u201cspecific binding\u201d. As used herein, \u201cspecific binding\u201d refers to antibody binding to a predetermined antigen. Typically, the antibody binds with an affinity corresponding to a KD of about 1\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M or less, and binds to the predetermined antigen with an affinity corresponding to a KD that is at least two orders of magnitude lower than its affinity for binding to a non-specific antigen (e.g., BSA, casein) other than the predetermined antigen or a closely-related antigen.</p>The term \u201cKD\u201d (M), as used herein, is intended to refer to the dissociation equilibrium constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction.</p>As used herein, \u201cisotype\u201d refers to the antibody class (e.g., IgM or IgG1) that is encoded by heavy chain constant region genes.</p>As used herein, \u201cisotype switching\u201d refers to the phenomenon by which the class, or isotype, of an antibody changes from one Ig class to one of the other Ig classes.</p>The term \u201cnaturally occurring\u201d as used herein as applied to an object refers to the fact that an object can be found in nature. For example, a polypeptide or polynucleotide sequence that is present in an organism (including viruses) that can be isolated from a source in nature and which has not been intentionally modified by man in the laboratory is naturally occurring.</p>The term \u201crearranged\u201d as used herein refers to a configuration of a heavy chain or light chain immunoglobulin locus wherein a V segment is positioned immediately adjacent to a D-J or J segment in a conformation encoding essentially a complete VH or VL domain, respectively. A rearranged immunoglobulin (antibody) gene locus can be identified by comparison to germline DNA; a rearranged locus will have at least one recombined heptamer/nonamer homology element.</p>The term \u201cunrearranged\u201d or \u201cgermline configuration\u201d as used herein in reference to a V segment refers to the configuration wherein the V segment is not recombined so as to be immediately adjacent to a D or J segment.</p>The",
    "rious concentrations of mAb for 10-30 min. at room temperature or at 37\u00b0 C. Serum or plasma can then be added to a final concentration of 20% (v/v) and the cells incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 20-30 min. All cells from each sample can be added to the PI solution in a FACS tube. The mixture can then be analyzed immediately by flow cytometry analysis using FACSArray.</p>In an alternative assay, induction of CDC can be determined on adherent cells. In one embodiment of this assay, cells are seeded 24 h before the assay with a density of 3\u00d710<sup>4</sup>/well in tissue-culture flat-bottom microtiter plates. The next day growth medium is removed and the cells are incubated in triplicates with antibodies. Control cells are incubated with growth medium or growth medium containing 0.2% saponin for the determination of background lysis and maximal lysis, respectively. After incubation for 20 min. at room temperature supernatant is removed and 20% (v/v) human plasma or serum in DMEM (prewarmed to 37\u00b0 C.) is added to the cells and incubated for another 20 min. at 37\u00b0 C. All cells from each sample are added to propidium iodide solution (10 \u03bcg/ml). Then, supernatants are replaced by PBS containing 2.5 \u03bcg/ml ethidium bromide and fluorescence emission upon excitation at 520 nm is measured at 600 nm using a Tecan Safire. The percentage specific lysis is calculated as follows: % specific lysis=(fluorescence sample-fluorescence background)/(fluorescence maximal lysis-fluorescence background)\u00d7100.</p>Inhibition of Cell Proliferation by Monoclonal Antibodies:</p>To test for the ability to initiate apoptosis, monoclonal anti-GT468 antibodies can, for example, be incubated with GT468 positive tumor cells or GT468 transfected tumor cells at 37\u00b0 C. for about 20 hours. The cells can be harvested, washed in Annexin-V binding buffer (BD biosciences), and incubated with Annexin V conjugated with FITC or APC (BD biosciences) for 15 min. in the dark. All cells from each sample can be added to PI solution (10 \u03bcg/ml in PBS) in a FACS tube and assessed immediately by flow cytometry (as above). Alternatively, a general inhibition of cell-proliferation by monoclonal antibodies can be detected with commercially available kits. The DELFIA Cell Proliferation Kit (Perkin-Elmer, Cat. No. AD0200) is a non-isotopic immunoassay based on the measurement of 5-bromo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation during DNA synthesis of proliferating cells in microplates. Incorporated BrdU is detected using europium labelled monoclonal antibody. To allow antibody detection, cells are fixed and DNA denatured using Fix solution. Unbound antibody is washed away and DELFIA inducer is added to dissociate europium ions from the labelled antibody into solution, where they form highly fluorescent chelates with components of the DELFIA Inducer. The fluorescence measured\u2014utilizing time-resolved fluorometry in the detection\u2014is proportional to the DNA synthesis in the cell of each well.</p>Preclinical Studies</p>Monoclonal antibodies which bind to GT468 also can be tested in an in vivo model (e.g. in immune deficient mice carrying xenografted tumors inoculated with cell lines expressing GT468, possibly after transfection) to determine their efficacy in controlling growth of GT468-expressing tumor cells.</p>In vivo studies after xenografting GT468 expressing tumor cells into immunocompromised mice or other animals can be performed using antibodies of the invention. Antibodies can be adminstered to tumor free mice followed by injection of tumor cells to measure the effects of the antibodies to prevent formation of tumors or tu",
    "of GT468 in tumor cells the effects of its siRNA induced gene silencing on essential cell functions were studied.</p>First, performance of breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and BT-549 in transwell migration assays was investigated. Baseline motility (chemokinesis) of both cell lines assessed by adding 5% FCS as chemoattractant to both the upper and lower chamber of the system was substantially inhibited by GT468 specific siRNA duplexes (FIG. 3A). Consequently, we also observed a marked reduction of the directional chemotactic migratory capacity of the cells (FIG. 3B). Moreover, chemoinvasion activity of cells was profoundly affected by GT468 siRNA treatment, as cells were not able to migrate along chemoattractant gradients by breaking through a barrier of Matrigel (FIG. 3C).</p>Next, it was observed that tumor cell proliferation as measured by BrdU incorporation into DNA was reduced by 80-90% in both cell lines by GT468 specific siRNA duplexes (FIG. 4A). Cell cycle analysis revealed a distinct G1/S arrest in the cells transfected with GT468 siRNA as the underlying cause for the proliferation block (FIG. 4B). Vitality of the cells was not affected and staining for Annexin V gave no indications for apoptotic cell death (FIG. 4C).</p>Example 5Treatment of Cancer Cells with Anti-GT468 Antibodies Inhibits Cell GrowthWe measured proliferation of MCF-7 and BT-549 cells incubated with rabbit anti-GT468/C-term and a non-reactive control antibody. Targeting of GT468 resulted in efficient inhibition of proliferation of both cell lines in a concentration-dependent manner (FIG. 5).</p>Example 6Downstream Effects of siRNA-Induced Silencing and Antibody-Induced Functional Antagonization of GT468Proliferation and cell cycle progression in eukaryotic cells is governed by cyclins and cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs). Individual cyclins act at different phases of the cell cycle by stimulating the activities of a series of CDKs. Restriction point control is mediated by cyclin D- and E-dependent kinase families (Morgan, D. O. (1997) Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 13, 261-291; Sherr, C. J. (2000) Cancer Res. 60, 3689-3695). To investigate whether GT468 silencing induces the observed cell cycle dysregulation via alteration of cyclin expression, expression of cyclins D1, D2, D3 and cyclin E in MCF-7 and BT-549 breast cancer cells treated with GT468 siRNA was determined.</p>Interestingly, a significant reduction of cyclin D1 transcripts as measured by real-time PCR (FIG. 6A) as well as cyclin D1 protein levels in Western blot (FIG. 6B) occurred as a consequence of GT468 knockdown. No change in transcription levels was observed for the other cyclins analyzed.</p>Cyclin D1 is known to be a major regulator of the G1 to S progression of the cell cycle. Interestingly, in the tumorigenesis of sporadic breast cancer, overexpression of cyclin D1 is regarded as an early event (Caldon, C. E., Daly, R. J., Sutherland, R. L. &amp; Musgrove, E. A. (2006) J.
