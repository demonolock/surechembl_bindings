Cardiac tissues formed from human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells have limited utility due to their immature, fetal-like phenotype.</p>SUMMARYThe disclosed subject matter provides functional human tissue units, engineered to combine biological fidelity with the use of high-throughput platforms and real-time measurement of physiological responses.</p>In accordance with one aspect, iPS cell-based vascular, cardiac and tumor micro-tissues are formed. The iPS based micro-tissues are functional three dimensional tissue units having tissue-specific architectures (\u201cultrastructures\u201d) having an integrated vascular network, microfluidic endothelialized connections between tissue modules, which establish a functional representation of human biology in health, injury and disease.</p>In one embodiment, the engineered tissue includes many of the molecular, structural, and functional properties of adult human heart muscle, including well-developed registers of sarcomeres, networks of T-tubules, mature calcium homeostasis, comprehensive responses to beta-adrenergic stimulation, and a positive force-frequency relationship. The advanced level of maturation was confirmed by comparison to human fetal heart tissue, and probed by studying physiological responses to drugs and by modeling heart disease. It was found that the measured drug EC50 values corresponded to plasma levels in patients, while the patient-specific model of Timothy Syndrome recapitulated the disease phenotype and the effects of clinically used drugs. Adult-like human heart muscle can be engineered in vitro and used for predictive studies of drugs and modeling of cardiac disease. Intensity training enables formation of adult-like heart muscle from patient-specific hiPS cells, for use in predictive studies of drugs and disease. In other embodiments, the engineered tissue is liver or vascular tissue.</p>In another aspect, a method is provided for engineering the 3-D micro-tissue. In one embodiment, the method includes deriving cardiomyocytes from induced stem cells (\u201ciPS\u201d) and encapsulating the derived cardiomyocytes in a hydrogel. The hydrogel encapsulated cardiomyocytes undergo electromechanical conditioning to achieve cell maturation. The electromechanical conditioning involves exposing the derived cardiomyocytes to electromechanical stimuli that increases in intensity over a period of time. The resultant three-dimensional cardiac tissue includes transverse (T)-tubules, high density of mitochondria and a positive force-frequency relationship, all of which are hallmark features of adult human heart tissue that have not been demonstrated previously.</p>An integral component of the tissue platform is a set of on-line methods for measuring functional responses of the heart tissue. Tissue contractility was measured by tracking the change in the",
    "an tissue models are provided. Different cell types desired for tissue construction can be generated from the same batch of iPS cells. In some embodiments, where molecular and functional imaging and study physiological processes at multiple hierarchical levels and in real time is desired, biosensors (reporters) can be incorporated into the iPS cells to monitor specific cell phenotypes in culture (for example, distinguish between endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes), and to monitor functional readouts for tissue cells.</p>In accordance with one embodiment, a fibrin hydrogel containing a cell suspension, including a ratio of 75% of iPS derived cardiomyocytes and 25% of fibroblasts is injected into each well of a bioreactor and allowed to polymerize. After adding media, the tissue shrinks around the posts, which provide passive tension, ultimately forming a functional cardiac microtissue on which to perform studies or screens.</p>To facilitate assembly of the platform, a mechanism is provided that allows easy plug-in of input and output micro fluidic tubing to ultimately drive the perfusion within the vascular bed and connect multiple organ systems. In parallel, methods are provided to integrate the vascular perfusion approaches with the cardiac micro-tissue platform.</p>In another embodiment, the generation of 3D cardiac constructs from hiPS derived cells result in cardiac micro-tissues that are phenotypically matured over time is taught. The drug testing data as the measured EC50 values fall into the range of reported values from both clinical and experimental studies and further support that the matured iPS cardiac micro-tissues can serve as a predictive model of human physiology.</p>The disclosed subject matter further relates to dynamic anisotropic loading of cell-hydrogel constructs induced to work against force at a gradually increasing intensity enabled the formation of adult-like heart muscle. An advanced biomimetic system is provided that integrates, inter alia, three biophysical cues: (i) co-culture of hiPS-CMs with supporting cells (to enable formation of mechanically robust tissue), (ii) anisotropic alignment within a hydrogel constrained between two flexible posts (to induce auxotonic contractions), and (iii) dynamic electromechanical training with a gradual increase in intensity (to induce maturation).</p>In accordance with another aspect, a bioreactor platform for engineering the described micro-tissue is provided. One embodiment of the bioreactor is depicted in FIGS. 15A to 15D. The bioreactor may include a plurality of platforms for scalable control of tissue architectures. Referring back to FIGS. 15A and 15B, an exploded view of a bioreactor is used to make the 3D functional micro-tissue is shown. The bioreactor includes components for an interlocking arrangement, including a microspecific media reservoir array, such as a standard 48 or 96 well plate can be used.

    " cell lines with at least 10 to 40% efficiency.</p>The present teaching provides a general approach to rapidly construct perfusable vascular networks lined with endothelial cells and perfused with blood under high-pressure pulsatile flow. Several methods are provided to generate channel architectures within matrix scaffolds using either sacrificial filaments or created by casting. In all of these cases, seeding human endothelial cells into these channels results in the formation of well-developed endothelium that exhibits characteristics of functional endothelium. Intraluminal flows are observed at high rates relative to extraluminal flow, tight junctions are identified that are permeable to trans luminal leakage only when cells are exposed to vasoactive permeating factors. To facilitate assembly of the platform, a mechanism is provided that allows easy plug-in of input and output micro fluidic tubing to ultimately drive the perfusion within the vascular bed and connect multiple organ systems. In parallel, methods are provided to integrate the vascular perfusion approaches with the cardiac microtissue platform.</p>The presently described subject matter provides the generation of 3D cardiac constructs from hiPS derived cells result in cardiac microtissues that are superior to 2D models and can be phenotypically matured within the described bioreactor over time and with the application of electromechanical conditioning regimens.

    "culture (FIG. 20B). In the absence of electrical stimulation, organoid contractility may become controlled by an internal Ca2+ clock, physiologically entrained by the training regime, and initiated via calcium-induced calcium release (FIGS. 27A-27C). By constantly increasing the stimulation rate, the ORGANOIDs responded by frequency-dependent acceleration of relaxation (FDAR, FIGS. 30G-30I), an intrinsic property of adult myocardium. Accordingly, contraction time, beat-to-beat variability and relaxation time were all lower in organoids than in other organoids or FCTs, decreasing as a function of time and training intensity (FIGS. 25B-25E).</p>A positive Frank-Starling response (increased twitch tension with increased length) was observed after 4 weeks of cultivation under all conditions as well as in FCTs (FIG. 20C; FIG. 25H), but only organoids, the organoids that experienced intensity training, exhibited mature calcium handling (FIGS. 27A-27C, FIG. 30G) and FDAR (FIGS. 30H-30I). While both FDAR and Frank-Starling responses have been demonstrated for hiPS-CMs, their immature phenotype prevented the functional convergence of lusitropic and ionotropic responses into a positive force-frequency relationship (FFR). When treated with the beta-adrenergic stimulus Isoprenaline, the organoids significantly increased their twitch tension (FIG. 26B), a response not seen in fetal cardiac tissues. These results correlated to the organoid's calcium sensitivity, as measured by the Calcium EC50 (FIG. 26A). Unstimulated organoids and FCTs lack a positive FFR (FIG. 20D), despite displaying FDAR and Frank-Starling response. In contrast, electromechanically trained organoids established a positive FFR after only 2 weeks of intensity training or 4 weeks of constant training (FIG. 20D, FIG. 26C). In contrast, control and constant training organoids and FCTs lacked a positive FFR despite their Frank-Starling responses. The dose-dependent response of contractile force to extracellular calcium was increased with intensity training (FIG. 20E). The measured increase in the maximum capture rate (MCR) and decrease in the excitation threshold (ET) (FIG. 20F, FIG. 20G) support the role of electromechanical training in functionally maturing hiPS-CMs.</p>When treated with the beta-adrenergic drug isoproterenol, organoids\u2014but not the other organoids or FCTs\u2014responded by increasing twitch tension (FIG. 26B). These results correlated to calcium sensitivity measured by the calcium EC50 (FIG. 26A). To further investigate functional calcium storage in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, organoids, controls and FCTs were exposed to caffeine, but only organoids were seen to release intracellular calcium (FIG. 30A-D).</p>Blocking the Cav1.2 calcium channels by verapamil resulted in cessation of calcium transients in all tissues (FIG. 38A). Addition of caffeine released intracellular calcium in intensity-trained organoids but not in other groups (FIG. 20H), suggesting that only intensity-trained organoids have functional intracellular calcium stores. When the ion-transport activity of the SR Ca2+ATPase (SERCA) was blocked by thapsigargin, the calcium transients ceased quickly in intensity-trained organoids, as calcium was depleted from the SR. Subsequent addition of caffeine had no effect on either group (FIG. 20I; FIG. 38B). The lack of this response in unstimulated organoids and FCTs (FIG. 20I) further confirmed that their calcium handling is largely dependent on extracellular calcium supplies. The ability to release calcium from SR stores when needed was further demonstrated by the increased force generation after post-rest potentiation measurements in organoids (FIGS. 30E-30F).</p>Consistent with the calcium handling data, the transcription of two genes responsible for clearing cytosolic calcium: SLC8A1 (encoding for the Na\u2014Ca Exchange Pump NCX), and ATP2A2 (encoding for SERCA), increased over time in the intensity-trained ORGANOIDs (FIG. 39). Intensity-driven e",
    "itionally organoids displayed enhanced mitochondria density (FIG. 34 images A-C, FIG. 34 image E), and the m- and z-lines (FIG. 34 images E-H), indicating sarcomeric maturation. The contractile demand resulted in increased cell size (by a factor of two compared to fetal cells (FIG. 29A, FIG. 29B), an indicator of physiological hypertrophy and cell elongation, an indicator of maturation. The sarcomere length of \u02dc2.2-2.3 \u03bcm achieved after 4 weeks of intensity training corresponds to that seen in adult human heart (FIG. 29C). As evidenced by fractional shortening data (FIG. 29D), the physiological sarcomere length corresponded to improved contractile capacity.</p>The functionally matured organoids were validated as physiologically relevant predictors of drug responses. The electromechanical induction of mature calcium homeostasis and ultrastructural maturation enabled positive ionotropic (FIG. 23A), lusitropic (FIG. 23B), and chronotropic (FIG. 23C) responses to the \u03b2-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, a phosphorylator of multiple SR-related targets whose functional response is greatly diminished in detubulated CMs (Orchard). Since the functional \u03b2-adrenoceptor system is dependent on the proximity of Cav1.2 channels and T-tubules, comprehensive responses to \u03b2-adrenergic agonists are an important indicator of phenotypic maturation. Also, predictable changes in beating frequency were measured for positive (FIG. 23D) and negative (FIG. 23E) chronotropic drugs. Overall, the measured EC50 values\u2014drug concentrations corresponding to a 50% change in tissue function\u2014were within the ranges of blood plasma levels measured in clinical studies. For comparison, unstimulated organoids and fetal tissues showed lower EC50 values, a result of increased drug sensitivity of functionally immature CMs (FIGS. 23C-23E).</p>Beyond demonstrating pharmacologically tunable changes in force and frequency, intensity-trained organoids displayed excellent predictability of clinically reported EC50 values for drugs inhibiting the hERG potassium channel, a frequent cause of arrhythmogenic side effects. The intracellular calcium transients were prolonged as the concentrations of E-4031 (FIG. 23F) and cisapride (FIG. 23G) increased, leading to early after-depolarizations (EADs) (FIG. 23H), which can trigger lethal arrhythmias. The other organoids and FCTs did not recapitulate proarrythmic tendencies when exposed to cisapride, resulting in poor predictive power for drug screening. Overall, the formation of T-tubules and proper calcium homeostasis within organoids enables studies of drug-induced changes in ion channels and macroscale handling in calcium, and of the contractile and functional dynamics, which, when disrupted, may cause arrhythmia.</p>The enhanced functional maturation of intensity-trained organoids enabled phenotypic recapitulation of Timothy Syndrome (TS), by using iPS cells obtained from an affected patient and a healthy family member. Patients with TS carry an autosomal dominant gain-of-function mutation within the DNA encoding for the Cav1.2 channel (CACNA1C), which is critical for EC coupling. This mutation causes the Cav1.2 channel to remain open longer than normal, resulting in depletion of calcium from the SR, accumulation of calcium in the cytosol, prolongation of the QT interval, and cardiac arrhythmia that can lead to sudden cardiac death. The TS phenotype in vitro was evidenced by slow, irregular contractions (30 bpm for TS organoids compared "
