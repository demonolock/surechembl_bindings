More specifically, the glycol derivative includes diethylene glycol dibenzoate.</p>[0031] In summary, the compound of the invention,</p>H2K1001 (901 or 90i) is a highly potent new antiretroviral drug or agent that works against resistant HIV viruses. Initial evaluation of this compound in the CEMSS cell line demonstrated significant antiviral activity against the RF laboratory strain of HIV-1. The purified fraction 90I (or 90i) yielded a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 0.02ug/ml. At the same time, there was no discernible drug induced toxicity in this study (50% inhibitory concentration, IC50, was greater than the high test concentration of 100ug/ml). The resulting therapeutic index (TI=IC50/EC50) of greater than 5000 suggests a highly active compound. Testing in PBMC against primary clinical isolates of HIV-1 P2, which is resistant to a variety of non- nucleoside inhibitors or HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. Also, the inventive \n\ncompound (H2K1001(90I or 90i)) produced an EC50 of 0.8ug/ml, an IC50 greater than 100, and a TI of greater than 125.</p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</p>[0032] The above and other objects, novel features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention, as illustrated in the drawings, in which:</p>[0033] Figure 1 is a graphical representation illustrating the effect of the compound of the present invention, H2K1001(901 or 90i), on HIV-1 in CEM-SS T-lymphoblastoid cells;</p>[0034] Figure 2 is a graphical representation illustrating the effect of control compound (AZT) on HIV-1 in CEM-SS T-lymphoblastoid cells;</p>[0035] Figure 3 is a graphical representation illustrating the effect of the compound of the present invention, H2K1001(901 or 90i), on HIV-1 (P2) in peripheral blood nonnuclear cells (PBMC); and</p>[0036] Figures 4 is a graphical representation illustrating the effect of control compound (AZT) on HIV-1 in PBMC. \n\n DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</p>[0037] The present invention is based on the discovery that an herbal extract, which includes a glycol derivative, is effective against HIV virus. More specifically, we found that the extract includes diethylene glycol dibenzoate, which in vitro testing showed to be effective against HIV- 1 virus.</p>[0038] We examined the antiviral activity of an antiviral agent or compound that we designated as 901 (or 90i) derived from an extract of an herbal mixture that we designated as H2K1001 , against the RF laborato"
