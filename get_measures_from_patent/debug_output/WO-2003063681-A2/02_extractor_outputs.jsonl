{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences:\n\nThe purified fraction 90I (or 90i) yielded a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 0.02ug/ml.\nAt the same time, there was no discernible drug induced toxicity in this study (50% inhibitory concentration, IC50, was greater than the high test concentration of 100ug/ml).\nThe resulting therapeutic index (TI=IC50/EC50) of greater than 5000 suggests a highly active compound.\nAlso, the inventive compound (H2K1001(90I or 90i)) produced an EC50 of 0.8ug/ml, an IC50 greater than 100, and a TI of greater than 125."}
