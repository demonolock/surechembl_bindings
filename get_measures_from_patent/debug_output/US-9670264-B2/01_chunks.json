    "resence of 2-ME is consistent with the changes in CD spectra observed under similar conditions. The requirement of the reducing agent to fully denature and unfold the protein indicates the relevance of an intramolecular disulfide bond in stabilizing the receptor structure. Although these observations suggest the presence of a disulfide bond, they do not specify which bond is formed given the existence of 11 cysteine residues in wsMUR-TM. However, the CD and ligand-binding studies are consistent with the adoption of the proper protein tertiary structure and by extension with the formation of the correct disulfide bond.</p>EXAMPLE 4Ligand Binding Properties of the wsMUR-TMA recently developed methodology which uses a fluorescently labeled ligand and the native MUR was used to investigate the ligand-binding capabilities of the water-soluble receptors. Naltrexone binding was monitored using a competitive TR-FRET (time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer) based assay with fluorescently labeled wild type MUR and a naltrexone-derived antagonist. The ratio of fluorescence emission at 665 nm and 620 nm decreased in a dose-dependent manner with increasing concentrations of wsMUR-TM. The determined K<sub>d </sub>values for naltrexone were 65\u00b11.8 nM (wsMUR-TM) (FIG. 7). As a negative control, human serum albumin (HSA, a soluble helical protein), rather than a water-soluble variant, was introduced with no significant change in the fluorescence ratio upon HSA addition.</p>This binding assay has been applied to study several GPCRs and particularly MUR, where the K<sub>i </sub>values for the morphinan opioids naloxone and naltrindole were estimated (5.1 nM and 8.1 nM for naloxone and naltrindole, respectively) and found to be in agreement with values obtained using other techniques, wsMUR-TM competes with native MUR expressed in HEK293 cells for the potent opioid antagonist naltrexone. This study demonstrates that the wsMUR-TM can compete with the native MUR for the fluorescent antagonist with binding affinities in nM range. The HSA (negative control) results indicate that the interaction of the water-soluble variant with naltrexone is selective and specific.</p>EXAMPLE 5Additional MUR ConstructsConstructs having unique sequences, but similar properties to the wsMUR-TM construct were also produced and analysed as described above. One such construct is a second wsMUR recombinant protein (wsMUR-TM+7mut\u2014SEQ ID NO: 2). Studies performed to characterize wsMUR-TM+7mut demonstrate its production and isolation using bacterial expression (FIG. 8), its alpha-helical nature as measure by CD (FIG. 9), and binding activity was also observed for related MUR constructs wsMUR-TM+7mut (FIG. 10). Similar characteristics were observed for the MUR constructs G-min (SEQ ID NO: 3), H-min (SEQ ID NO: 4), I-min (SEQ ID NO: 5), and D-min (SEQ ID NO: 7) (see figures FIGS. 11 and 12).</p>EXAMPLE 6Production and Isolation of a Water-Soluble Human Beta<sub>2 </sub>Adrenergic Rec"
