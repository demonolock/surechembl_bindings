    " which new blood vessels are formed. Angiogenesis can occur as a normal physiological process during periods of tissue growth, such as an increase in muscle, wound repair and pregnancy, but can also be associated to a disease condition where the growth of blood vessels is not beneficial to the health of the patient, such as cancer and diabetic retinopathy.</p>The term \u201ccancer\u201d as used herein refers to a medical condition mediated by neoplastic or malignant cell group, proliferation, or metastasis, including solid cancers and non-solid cancers. Examples of cancer include but are not limited to, lung cancer, kidney cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer, brain cancer, prostate cancer, hepatocellular cancer, pancreatic cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, cancer of the urinary tract, thyroid cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, colon cancer, leukemia, lymphomas and myelomas.</p>The term \u201ccachexia\u201d refers to a state of general ill health and malnutrition. It is usually associated with and induced by malignant cancer, and is characterized by severe loss of appetite, dramatic loss of body mass, especially lean body mass, and muscle wasting.</p>High Affinity Anti-IL6 Antibodies</p>The present disclosure is based on the identification of a number of high affinity anti-IL6 antibodies, including 1-4-62, Ag1-4-6 (also known as FB704), and HAg1T-3-10. These anti-IL6 antibodies were found to bind to human IL-6 with high binding affinity (e.g., having a KD value less than 10<sup>\u22128</sup>M, preferably less than 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>M) and high specificity, e.g., binding to other IL6 family cytokines such as those shown in FIG. 3 with a much lower binding affinity as compared with human IL6. Further, these antibodies were found to significantly reduce IL-6 induced cell proliferation and STATS phosphorylation, angiogenesis and hemoglobin production. Moreover, these anti-IL6 antibodies successfully suppressed cancer-induced (e.g., prostate cancer-induced) cachexia, pancreatic cancer growth, and cancer metastasis such as prostate cancer metastasis, significantly enhanced anti-cancer effects of other chemotherapeutic agents such as oxaliplatin, gemcitabine, and docetaxel, and reduced inflammatory cytokine (e.g., MCP-1 and sICAM) and/or VEGF production by HUVEC and PBMC cells and/or synovial fibroblasts, e.g., those obtained from RA patients.</p>Accordingly, described herein are high affinity antibodies capable of binding to (e.g., specifically binding to) human IL6, including 1-4-62, Ag1-4-6, and HAg1T-3-10, and their functional variants. The amino acid sequences of the heavy chain variable region (V<sub>H</sub>) and light chain variable region (V<sub>L</sub>) of each of 1-4-62, Ag1-4-6, and HAg1T-3-10 are shown in Table 1 below. A functional variant of any of these three antibodies can comprise a V<sub>H </sub>chain that comprises an amino acid sequence at least 85% (e.g., 90%, 92%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99%) identical to that of the V<sub>H </sub>of 1-4-62, Ag1-4-6, or HAg1T-3-10 (SEQ ID NO:17 or SEQ ID NO:18), a V<sub>L </sub>chain that has an amino acid sequence at least 85% (e.g., 90%, 92%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99%) identical to that of the V<sub>L </sub>of 1-4-62, Ag1-4-6, or HAg1T-3-10 (SEQ ID NO:19 or SEQ ID NO:20), or both. These variants are capable of binding to human IL6. In some examples, the variants possess similar antigen-binding affinity relative to the reference antibodies described above (e.g., having a K<sub>d </sub>less than 1\u00d710<sup>\u22128</sup>, preferably less than 1\u00d710 or 1\u00d710<sup>\u221210 </sup>M).</p>The affinity of the binding is defined by the terms ka (associate rate constant), kd (dissociation rate constant), or KD (equilibrium dissociation). Typically, specifically binding when used with respect to an antibody refers to an antibody that specifically binds to (\u201crecognizes\u201d) its target(s) with an affinity (KD) value less than 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, e.g., less than 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>M or 10<sup>\u221210 </sup>M. A lower KD value represents a higher binding affinity (i.e., stronger binding) so that a KD value of 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>indicates a higher binding affinity than a KD value of 10<sup>\u22128</sup>.</p>The \u201cpercent identity\u201d of two amino acid sequences is determined using the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:2264-68, 1990, modified as in Karlin and Altschul Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:5873-77, 1993. Such an algorithm is incorporated into the NBLAST and XBLAST programs (version 2.0) of Altschul, et al. J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-10, 1990. BLAST protein searches can be performed with the XBLAST program, score=50, wordlength=3 to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to the protein molecules of interest. Where gaps exist between two sequences, Gapped BLAST can be utilized as described in Altschul et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 25(17):3389-3402, 1997. When utilizing BLAST and Gapped BLAST programs, the default parameters of the respective programs (e.g., XBLAST and NBLAST) can be used.</p>Antibodies binding to the same epitopes as 1-4-62, Ag1-4-6, and HAg1T-3-10 are also within the scope of the present disclosure.</p>In some embodiments, the anti-IL6 antibody comprises a heavy chain variable region (V<sub>H</sub>) that comprises a HC CDR3 of MHIDDSNGYXSDAF (SEQ ID NO:21), in which X is an aromatic amino acid residue such as F, Y, H, or W. In some examples, the HC CDR3 is SEQ ID NO:6 or SEQ ID NO:16. The V<sub>H </sub>chain of such an antibody can further comprise a HC CDR1 of SEQ ID NO:2, a HC CDR2 of SEQ ID NO:2, or both.</p>Alternatively or in addition, the anti-IL6 antibody comprises a light chain variable region (V<sub",

Any combination of deletion, insertion, and substitution is made to achieve the final construct, provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics.

    "t the abdominal wall was incised longitudinally (parallel to the spine) for 1 cm. The spleen was exteriorized and stabilized gently. A 30-gauge needle on an insulin syringe was inserted into the parenchyma of the spleen for 3-4 mm. 50 \u03bcl of a PC-3 cell suspension was injected slowly. A visible pale wheal indicates a successful injection. The needle was then retracted and a small cotton ball was placed to cover the injection site for 30 seconds to prevent bleeding and spillage of the cell suspension. The spleen was placed back into the peritoneum. The abdominal wall was closed with a 6-0 nylon suture, and the skin was closed with a 4-0 nylon suture.</p>After the implantation, the mice were randomly assigned to different treatment groups (Docetaxel group Docetaxel plus anti-IL6 antibody group, and PBS control group) and were treated with multiple doses of anti-IL6 antibody (20 mg/kg each time, twice a week), Docetaxel (3 mg/kg each time, once per week) through the tail vein or by i.p injection. The body weights of those mice were measured twice a week.</p>All mice were then euthanized by CO<sub>2 </sub>asphyxiation and body weights were determined. Primary tumors in the spleen and liver were excised, photographed, and weighed. Organ index was expressed as milligram organ per gram mouse. Mean+SD were calculated using Student's t-test. The survival assay was used Kaplan-Meier analysis. Paraffin-embedded or frozen section of tumor masses were prepared and stained by anti-CD31 and Ki-67 plus Hematoxylin staining for analysis.</p>(iv) Xenograft Human Pancreatic Tumor Model Human pancreatic tumor cells BxPC-3 and MiaPaCa cells were re-suspended in PBS and injected subcutaneously (s.c.) (5\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>cells, total volume 0.15 mL) into the right flank of mice. After 10 days, the mice were randomly assigned to different treatment groups (Antibody FB704, Oxaliplatin, FB704 plus Oxaliplatin, Gemcitabine, and PBS control groups) and treated with multiple doses of FB704 (20 mg/kg each time, twice a week) or Oxaliplatin (3 mg/kg each time, once a week), or Gemcitabine (80 mg/kg each time, twice per week) through the tail vein or by i.p. injection. Mice body weights and the tumor sizes were measured twice a week. Tumor sizes were measured using a caliper, and the tumor volume was calculated by length\u00d7width\u00d70.52. After the experiment, all mice were sacrificed, mice blood samples were collected and the tumor masses were removed and weighted. The differences in mean tumor volume and tumor weight were evaluated by Student's t-test. Paraffin-embedded or frozen section of tumor masses were prepared and stained by anti-CD31, Ki67 or TUNEL plus H&amp;E staining for analysis.\n\nResults\n\n(i) FB704 Inhibits In Vivo Angiogenesis in a Matrigel Assay\n</p>The anti-angiogenic ability of FB704 was examined in an in vivo matrigel model as described herein.
