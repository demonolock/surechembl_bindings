    "mammals. Cathepsin S and indeed many other crucial mammalian proteinases belong to the papain-like CAC1 family (see Barrett, A. J et al, in \u2018Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes\u2019, Eds. Barrett, A. J., Rawlings, N. D., and Woessner, J. F. Publ. Academic Press, 1998, for a thorough discussion).</p>To date, cysteine proteinases have been classified into five clans, CA, CB, CC, CD and CE (Barrett, A. J. et al, 1998). A proteinase from the tropical papaya fruit \u2018papain\u2019 forms the foundation of clan CA, which currently contains over 80 distinct and complete entries in various sequence databases, with many more expected from the current genome sequencing efforts. Proteinases of clan CA/family C1 have been implicated in a multitude of house-keeping roles and disease processes, e.g. human proteinases such as cathepsin K (osteoporosis, osteoarthritis), cathepsin S (multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune disorders), cathepsin L (metastases), cathepsin B (metastases, arthritis), cathepsin F (antigen processing), cathepsin V (T-cell selection), dipeptidyl peptidase I (granulocyte serine proteinase activation) or parasitic proteinases such as falcipain (malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum) and cruzipain (Trypanosoma cruzi infection).</p>There currently exists a major unmet need for safe orally administered medications for the treatment of immune-based inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, asthma, atherosclerosis etc. The therapeutic inhibition of cathepsin S has been of great interest to the pharmaceutical industry as a potential target for immune system modulation. Cathepsin S is a lysosomal cysteine proteinase that is specifically up-regulated under inflammatory conditions. It is highly expressed in the spleen, in professional antigen presenting cells (APC's) and other MHC class II-positive cells and is inducible by IFN-\u03b3. Intracellular cathepsin S specifically processes invariant chain, a protein involved in the correct loading of MHC-II with antigen (a key step in generating an immune response) (see Shi, G. P. et al., Immunity, 10(2). 197-206, 1999; Lui, W. and Spero, D. M. Drug News Perspect. 17(6), 357-363, 2004). The MHC-II/antigen complex is then displayed on the surface of the APC, for interaction with and activation of T-cells. Disrupting antigen presentation represents a validated approach to treating diseases with an autoimmune component such as rheumatoid arthritis (e.g. see Podolin, P. L., et al., Inflamm Res 50:S159. 2001), multiple sclerosis and myasthenia gravis.</p>As well as its intracellular role in antigen presentation, cathepsin S is secreted from macrophages infiltrating sites of inflammation, to aid proteolysis of proteins and facilitate phagocytosis. However, in chronic inflammatory situations cathepsin S is responsible for degradation of structural tissue proteins and also mediates pain. Cathepsin S has been implicated in the destruction of articular cartilage in rheumatoid and osteoarthritis (e.g. see Hou, W-S. et al, Arthritis and Rheumatism, 46(3), 663-674, 2002 and refs cited therein), vascular tissue damage in atherosclerosis (e.g. see Rodgers, K. J. et al., Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 26, 851-6, 2006) and lung tissue damage in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g. see Shapiro, S. D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 30(2), 98-102, 2002 and refs cited therein). Therefore an inhibitior of cathepsin S has the potential to tackle both diseases mediated through antigen presentation and extracellular matrix damage.</p>Additionally, cathepsin S has been shown to be critical for the maintenance of neuropathic pain and spinal microglia activation in peripheral nerve-injured rats (see Clark, A. K. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 104(25), 10655-10660, 2007; Barclay, J., et al., Pain, 130(3), 225-234, 2007). Therefore inhibition of cathepsin S has therapeutic potential in the treatment of neuropathic pain (e.g. see WO-A-03020287).</p>In the prior art, the development of cysteine proteinase inhibitors for human use has recently been an area of intense activity (e.g. see Deaton, D. N. and Kumar, S., Prog. Med. Chem. 42, 245-375, 2004; Bromme, D. and Kaleta, J., Curr. Pharm. Des., 8, 1639-1658, 2002; Kim, W. and Kang, K., Expert Opin. Ther. Patents, 12(3), 419-432, 2002; Leung-Toung, R. et al. Curr. Med. Chem., 9, 979-1002, 2002; Lecaille, F. et al., Chem. Rev., 102, 4459-4488, 2002; Hernandez, A. A. and Roush, W. R., Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol., 6, 459-465, 2002; Link, J. O. and Zipfel, S. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Dev., 9(4), 471-482, 2006). Considering the CAC1 family members, particular emphasis has been placed upon the development of inhibitors of human cathepsins, primarily cathepsin K (osteoporosis) and cathepsin S (autoimmune disorders) through the use of covalent-bound but reversible peptide and peptidomimetic nitriles (e.g. see Bekkali, Y. et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 17(9), 2465-2469, 2007; WO-A-07137738, WO-A-07003056), linear and cyclic peptide and peptidomimetic ketones (e.g. see Veber, D. F. and Thompson, S. K., Curr. Opin. Drug Discovery Dev., 3(4), 362-369, 2000; WO-A-02057270, WO-A-04007501, WO-A-06064286, WO-A-05066180, WO-A-0069855), ketoheterocycles (e.g. see Palmer, J. T. et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 16(11), 2909-2914, 2006, WO-A-04000838), \u03b1-ketoamides (e.g. see WO-A-06102243), cyanoamides (WO-A-01077073, WO-A-01068645) and arylnitriles (e.g. see WO-A-07080191, WO-A-07039470, WO-A-06018284, WO-A-05121106, WO-A-04000843) Inhibition of CAC1 proteases by non-covalent bound compounds has been extensively described in the literature. Particular emphasis has been placed upon inhibition of cathepsin K and cathepsin S by arylaminoethylamides (e.g. see Altmann, E., et al, J. Med. Chem., 45(12), 2352-2354, 2002; Chatterjee, A. K. et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 17(10), 2899-2903, 2007; US-20050113356, US-20050107368, US-20050118568) and substituted pyrazoles or piperidines (e.g. see Wei, J., et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 17(20), 5525-5528, 2007; US-2007117785, US-2003073672, WO-A-02020013).</p>Thus the extensive prior art describes potent in vitro inhibitors of cathepsin S and inhibitors showing efficacy in numerous animal models of disease. However, the many difficulties in developing a human therapeutic for inhibition of cathepsin S are also evident since presently only one compound is in clinical development (RWJ-445380 for rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis).</p>Recently, Quibell, M. (WO-A-02057270) described a new motif for the general inhibition of CAC1 proteinases based upon a cis-5,5-bicyclic ketone (1).</p><img id=\"EMI-C00002\" path=\"US20110009386A1-20110113-C00002.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/158405680/US/20110113/A1/020110/00/93/86/US20110009386A1-20110113-C00002.TIF\"/></p>Based upon this motif, highly potent and selective inhibitors of cathepsin K were discovered (see WO-A-0807109, WO-A-0807103, WO-A-0807130, WO-A-0807114, WO-A-0807127, WO-A-0807107, WO-A-0807112).

    "bitor of one or more cysteine proteinases.</p>Compounds of general formula (I) are useful both as laboratory tools and as therapeutic agents. In the laboratory certain compounds of the invention are useful in establishing whether a known or newly discovered cysteine proteinase contributes a critical or at least significant biochemical function during the establishment or progression of a disease state, a process commonly referred to as \u2018target validation\u2019.</p>According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of validating a known or putative cysteine proteinase as a therapeutic target, the method comprising:</p>(a) assessing the in vitro binding of a compound as described above to an isolated known or putative cysteine proteinase, providing a measure of potency; and optionally, one or more of the steps of:\n\n(b) assessing the binding of the compound to closely related homologous proteinases of the target and general house-keeping proteinases (e.g. trypsin) to provide a measure of selectivity;\n\n(c) monitoring a cell-based functional marker of a particular cysteine proteinase activity, in the presence of the compound; and\n\n(d) monitoring an animal model-based functional marker of a particular cysteine proteinase activity in the presence of the compound.\n</p>The invention therefore provides a method of validating a known or putative cysteine proteinase as a therapeutic target. Differing approaches and levels of complexity are appropriate to the effective inhibition and \u2018validation\u2019 of a particular target. In the first instance, the method comprises assessing the in vitro binding of a compound of general formula (I) to an isolated known or putative cysteine proteinase, providing a measure of \u2018potency\u2019. An additional assessment of the binding of a compound of general formula (I) to closely related homologous proteinases of the target and general house-keeping proteinases (e.g. trypsin) provides a measure of \u2018selectivity\u2019. A second level of complexity may be assessed by monitoring a cell-based functional marker of a particular cysteine proteinase activity, in the presence of a compound of general formula (I). For example, an \u2018osteoclast resorption assay\u2019 has been utilised as a cell-based secondary in vitro testing system for monitoring the activity of cathepsin K and the biochemical effect of proteinase inhibitors (e.g. see WO-A-9850533). An \u2018MHC-II processing\u2014T-cell activation assay\u2019 has been utilised as a cell-based secondary in vitro testing system for monitoring the activity of cathepsin S and the biochemical effect of proteinase inhibitors (Shi, G-P., et al, Immunity, 10, 197-206, 1999). When investigating viral or bacterial infections such a marker could simply be a functional assessment of viral (e.g. count of mRNA copies) or bacterial loading and assessing the biochemical effect of proteinase inhibitors. A third level of complexity may be assessed by monitoring an animal model-based functional marker of a particular cysteine proteinase activity, in the presence of a compound of general formula (I). For example, murine models of Leishmania infection, P. vinckei infection, malaria (inhibition of falcipain) and T. cruzi infection (cruzipain), indicate that inhibition of cysteine proteinases that play a key role in pathogen propagation is effective in arresting disease symptoms, \u2018validating\u2019 said targets.</p>The invention therefore extends to the use of a compound of general formula (I) in the validation of a known or putative cysteine proteinase as a therapeutic target.</p>Biological ActivityThe compounds of the present invention are structurally distinct from the prior art (e.g. WO-A-02057270; Quibell, M. et. al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. 13, 609-625, 2005; Quibell M, et al Bioorg. Med. Chem., 12, 5689-5710, 2004; WO-A-05066180) in that a 6-(S)-chloro substituent and a 4-substituted cyclohexylglycyl moiety form an integral part. This combination of features provides compounds with surprisingly high efficacies for human cathepsin S and high in vitro selectivity versus other mammalian cathepsins, both of which are important properties required for development of an efficacious therapeutic. If either of these intrinsic moieties is removed from compounds of formula I, then a surprisingly large loss in potency and/or a significant loss in selectivity is observed. Indeed, all of the compounds of the present invention prepared to date exhibit potent and selective in vitro inhibition for human cathepsin S with Ki&lt;25 nM. In contrast, the majority of the eighty-two prior art compounds detailed in WO-A-02057270 are significantly less potent against human cathepsin S than the compounds of the present invention, and in the majority of examples, greater than 100-fold less potent.</p>The closest prior art, compound (38) (see WO-A-02057270, pg 151), exhibits a 111-fold improvement in in vitro potency against human cathepsin S upon addition of a 6-(S)-chloro substituent and substitution of the (S)-cyclohexylalanyl moiety with trans-(S)-(4(S)-methylcyclohexyl)glycyl (EXAMPLE 1). The surprising synergistic relationship between these two intrinsic changes is clearly seen when comparing prior art compound (38) with novel compounds (1-6) and EXAMPLE 1. Prior art compound (38) exhibits a 2.5-fold improvement in in vitro potency against human cathepsin S upon substitution of the (S)-cyclohexylalanyl moiety with (S)-(cyclohexyl)glycyl (Compound 1) but provides an inhibitor that has little selectivity verses cathepsin K. Further addition of a 6-(S)-fluoro substituent to Compound 1 provides a 3.8-fold improvement in in vitro potency against human cathepsin S (Compound 2) but again provides an inhibitor that has little selectivity verses cathepsin K. Alternatively, addition of a 6-(S)-chloro substituent to Compound 1 provides a 27-fold improvement in in vitro potency against human cathepsin S (Compound 3) but again provides an inhibitor that has only a modest 4-fold selectivity verses cathepsin K.

    "ses cathepsin K. However, whilst substitution of the (5)-cyclohexylglycyl moiety of Compound 7 with trans-(S)-(4(S)-methylcyclohexyl)glycyl (Compound 10) only provides a modest 2.2-fold improvement in in vitro potency against human cathepsin S, the selectivity verses other mammalian cathepsins, in particular cathepsin K, is dramatically increased to &gt;125-fold. In contrast, addition of a 6-(S)-chloro substituent to Compound 7 and substitution of the (S)-cyclohexylglycyl moiety with a trans-(S)-(4(S)-methylcyclohexyl)glycyl (EXAMPLE 2) or (S)-(4,4-dimethylcyclohexyl)glycyl (EXAMPLE 3) not only provides a significant improvement in potency verses cathepsin S (77-fold and 15-fold respectively) but also gives an inhibitor with high selectivity against other mammalian cathepsins. Again the importance of both of these modifications for compounds of formula I is clearly seen when comparing EXAMPLE 2 with Compounds 11 and 12. Compound 11 which contains the 6-(S)-fluoro substituent in place of the 6-(S)-chloro substituent of EXAMPLE 2 is 11-fold less potent verses cathepsin S, but retains the high selectivity due to presence of the trans-(S)-(4(S)-methylcyclohexyl)glycyl moiety. Compound 12 which contains the 6-(R)-chloro substituent in place of the 6-(S)-chloro substituent of EXAMPLE 2 is 25-fold less potent verses cathepsin S, but again retains the high selectivity due to presence of the trans-(S)-(4(S)-methylcyclohexyl)glycyl moiety.</p>Preferably, the compounds exhibit in vitro inhibition versus human cathepsin S with Ki &lt;10 nM, more preferably &lt;5 nM, even more preferably &lt;2 nM and more preferably still &lt;1 nM. The compounds of the invention exhibit high selectivity against other mammalian cathepsins displaying little or no inhibitory activity for cathepsins K, L, B and V at 1 \u03bcM compound.</p>Therapeutic UseCompounds of general formula (I) are useful for the in vivo treatment or prevention of diseases in which participation of a cysteine proteinase is implicated.</p>Preferably, the compound of general formula I is selective for cathepsin S. As used herein, the term \u201cselective for cathepsin S\u201d means that the inhibitor is selective for cathepsin S over one or more other mammalian CAC1 cysteinyl proteinases for example cathepsin K, cathepsin L, cathepsin F, cathepsin B and cathepsin V. Preferably, the inhibitor exhibits a selectivity ratio for cathepsin S over other mammalian CAC1 cysteinyl proteinases of greater than 2-fold, more preferably greater than 5-fold, more preferably greater than 10-fold, even more preferably greater than 25-fold, more preferably still, greater than 50-fold or 100-fold.</p>According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a compound of general formula (I) for use in medicine, especially for preventing or treating diseases in which the disease pathology may be modified by inhibiting a cysteine proteinase.</p>According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided the use of a compound of general formula (I) in the preparation of ",

The K<sub>i </sub>values were calculated, from the dependence of enzyme activity as a function of inhibitor concentration, by direct regression analysis (Prism v 3.02) using Equation 2 (Cornish-Bowden, A., 1995).</p>vi=V\ue89em\ue89e\ue89eaxapp\u00b7[S][S]+{KMapp\u00b7([I]/Ki)}(2)</p>In Equation 2 \u2018v<sub>i</sub>\u2019 is the observed residual activity, \u2018V<sub>max</sub><sup>app</sup>\u2019 is the observed maximum activity (i.e. in the absence of inhibitor), \u2018K<sub>M</sub><sup>app</sup>\u2019 is the apparent macroscopic binding (Michaelis) constant for the substrate, \u2018[S]\u2019 is the initial substrate concentration, \u2018K<sub>i</sub>\u2019 is the apparent dissociation constant and \u2018[I]\u2019 is the inhibitor concentration.</p>In situations where the apparent dissociation constant (K<sub>i</sub><sup>app</sup>) approached the enzyme concentrations, the K<sub>i</sub><sup>app </sup>values were calculated using a quadratic solution in the form described by Equation 3 (Morrison, J.

Curves were fitted by non-linear regression analysis (Prism) using a fixed value for the enzyme concentration. Equation 4 was used to account for the substrate kinetics, where \u2018K<sub>i</sub>\u2019 is the inhibition constant, \u2018[S<sub>o</sub>]\u2019 is the initial substrate concentration and \u2018K<sub>M</sub><sup>app</sup>\u2019 is the apparent macroscopic binding (Michaelis) constant for the substrate (Morrison, 1982).</p>The Second-Order Rate of Reaction of Inhibitor with Enzyme</p>Where applicable, the concentration dependence of the observed rate of reaction (k<sub>obs</sub>) of each compound with enzyme was analysed by determining the rate of enzyme inactivation under pseudo-first order conditions in the presence of substrate (Morrison, J. F., TIBS, 102-105, 1982; Tian, W. X. and Tsou, C. L., Biochemistry, 21, 1028-1032, 1982; Morrison, J. F. and Walsh, C. T., from Meister (Ed.), Advances in Enzymol., 61, 201-301, 1988; Tsou, C. L., from Meister (Ed.), Advances in Enzymol., 61, 381-436, 1988). Assays were carried out by addition of various concentrations of inhibitor to assay buffer containing substrate. Assays were initiated by the addition of enzyme to the reaction mixture and the change in fluorescence monitored over time. During the course of the assay less than 10% of the substrate was consumed.</p>F=vs\ue89et+(vo-vs)\ue8a0[1-\uf74d(kobs\u00b7t)]kobs+D(5)</p>The activity fluorescence progress curves were fitted by non-linear regression analysis (Prism) using Eq. 5 (Morrison, 1969; Morrison, 1982); where \u2018F\u2019 is the fluorescence response, 1\u2032 is time, \u2018v<sub>o</sub>\u2019 is the initial velocity, \u2018v<sub>s</sub>\u2019 is the equilibrium steady-state velocity, \u2018k<sub>obs</sub>\u2019 is the observed pseudo first-order rate constant and \u2018D\u2019 is the intercept at time zero (i.e. the ordinate displacement of the curve). The second order rate constant was obtained from the slope of the line of a plot of k<sub>obs </sub>versus the inhibitor concentration (i.e. k<sub>obs</sub>/[I]). To correct for substrate kinetics, Eq. 6 was used, where \u2018[S<sub>o</sub>]\u2019 is the initial substrate concentration and \u2018K<sub>M</sub><sup>app</sup>\u2019 is the apparent macroscopic binding (Michaelis) constant for the substrate.</p>kinact=kobs\ue8a0(1+[So]/KMapp)[I](6)</p>Compounds of the invention when tested by the above described assays exhibit cathepsin K inhibitory activity with an in vitro Ki inhibitory constant of less than or equal to 100 nM.</p>Liver Microsomal Incubations:Human and rat liver microsomes were purchased from BD Gentest (Woburn, Mass., USA) and \u03b2-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 2\u2032-phosphate reduced tetrasodium salt (NADPH) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Poole, Dorset, UK). All liver microsome incubations were carried out in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.4, with a final microsomal protein concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. Compounds were taken from 5 mM DMSO stock solutions and diluted in incubation buffer to give a final concentration of 25 \u03bcM, with a final DMSO concentration of 0.5% v/v. In brief, compounds were added to the incubation buffer along with the liver microsomes and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 10 minutes. The reaction was then initiated by the addition of NADPH, previously dissolved in incubation buffer, to give a final concentration of 1 mM and re-incubated at 37\u00b0 C. Aliquots were removed at 2 and 60 minutes and quenched with an equal volume of cold acetonitrile. After mixing vigorously, the precipitated protein matter was removed by filtration (Multiscreen Solvinert filter plates, Millipore, Bedford, Mass., USA) and the filtrate analysed by reverse phase HPLC with mass spectrometric detection, using single ion monitoring of the [M+H]<sup>+</sup> species. Metabolic turnover was determined by comparison of peak areas from the ion chromatograms of the parent compound at 2 and 60 minutes and expressed as percent remaining at 1 h",
    "phases to separate. The PBS layer was analysed by reverse phase HPLC with mass spectrometric detection, using single ion monitoring of the [M+H]<sup>+</sup> species. LogD<sub>(PBS) </sub>was determined by comparison of the peak area from the ion chromatogram of the compound in the PBS phase with that of a 50 \u03bcM standard of the same compound dissolved in acetonitrile/water (50:50) and calculated using the following formula:</p>Log\ue89e\ue89eD=Log\ue8a0[AUCstd-AUCpbsAUCpbs]</p>Where AUCstd and AUCpbs are the peak areas from the standard and test ion chromatograms respectively. LogD<sub>(PBS) </sub>determinations were also made using PBS at pH6.9 and 5.5 by adjusting the pH of the buffer prior to the start of the assay, with 0.1 M HCL.</p>Various modifications and variations of the described aspects of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention.
