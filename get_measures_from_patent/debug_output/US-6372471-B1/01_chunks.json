    "om enzyme, such as phospholipase or hyaluronidase, or recombinant fragments thereof. Such an allergen and fragments thereof are useful for diagnosis of allergy, for therapeutic treatment of allergy, for the treatment of immune system related diseases or disorders, or symptoms related thereto, and for the modulation of immune response towards an immunogen.</p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONBiochemical Aspects of Insect Venom AllergensInsect sting allergy to bees and vespids is of common occurrence. The vespids include hornets, yellowjackets and wasps (Golden, et al., 1989, Am. Med. Assoc. 262:240). Susceptible people can be sensitized on exposure to minute amounts of venom proteins; as little as 2-10 \u03bcg of protein is injected into the skin on a single sting by a vespid (Hoffman and Jacobson, 1984, Ann. Allergy. 52:276).</p>There are many species of hornets (genus Dolichovespula), yellowjackets (genus Vespula) and wasp (genus Polistes) in North America (Akre, et al., 1980, \u201cYellowjackets of America North of Mexico,\u201d Agriculture Handbook No. 552, U.S. Department of Agriculture). The vespids have similar venom compositions (King, et al., 1978, Biochemistry 17:5165; King, et al., 1983, Mol. Immunol. 20:297; King, et al., 1984, Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 230:1; King, et al., 1985, J. Allergy and Clin. Immunol. 75:621; King, 1987, J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 79:113; Hoffman, 1985, J. Allergy and Clin. Immunol. 75:611). Their venom each contains three major venom allergens, phospholipase (37 kD), hyaluronidase (43 kD) and antigen 5 (23 kD) of as yet unknown biologic function.</p>In addition to the insect venom allergens described above, the complete amino acid sequence of several major allergens from different grass (Perez, et al., 1990, J. Biol. Chem. 265:16210; Ansari, et al., 1989, Biochemistry 26:8665; Silvanovich, et al., 1991, J. Biol. Chem. 266:1204), tree pollen (Breiteneder, 1989, EMBO J. 8:1935; Valenta, et al., 1991, Science, 253:557), weed pollen (Rafnar, et al., 1991, J. Biol. Chem. 266:1229; Griffith, et al., 1991, Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 96:296), mites (Chua, et al., 1988, J. Exp. Med. 167:175), cat dander (Griffith, et al., 1992, Gene. 113:263), and mold (Aruda, et al., 1990, J. Exp. Med. 172:1529; Han, et al., 1991, J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 87:327) have been reported in the past few years. These major allergens are proteins of 10-40 kD and they have widely different biological functions. Nearly all allergens of known sequences have a varying extent of sequence similarity with other proteins in our environment.</p>T and B Cell Epitopes of AllergensAntibody responses to proteins require the collaboration of T helper and B lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells (APC). The antigen receptors of B cells are the membrane-bound antibody (Ab) molecules, which recognize and bind immunogens directly. The antigen receptors of T cells (TCR) only recognize and bind complexes of antigenic peptide-MHC class II molecule. Immunogens are first processed by APC into peptides that are presented on the surface of APC in association with the MHC class II molecules (Unanue, 1992, Current Opinion in Immunol 4:63). As MHC molecules are highly polymorphic in individuals, they have different specificity of binding antigenic peptides (Rothbard and Gefter, 1991, Ann. Rev. Immunol. 9:527). This is one mechanism for genetic control of immune response.</p>T helper cells are activated when the antigen receptor binds the peptide-MHC complex on the surface of APC. Activated T cells secrete lymphokines. In mice (Street and Mosmann, 1991, FASEB J. 5:171) and apparently in humans (Wierenga, et al., 1990, J. Immunol. 144:4651; Parronchi, et al., 1991, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 88:4538) the T helper cells can be divided into different types on the basis of their patterns of lymphokine production. Primarily, T helper cells divide into two gr",
    "ntrons were deleted from one of the strands. A cell was then transfected with the plasmid using methods described above, and the cell was then cloned. Since one of the two DNA strands in the original plasmid had the introns deleted, half of the transfected cells contained a double stranded plasmid in which the introns had been removed. The cloned were then screened to isolate the cells having the plasmid comprising paper wasp cDNA comprising a DNA sequence of SEQ ID NO:63 (without introns). Copies of the particular plasmid were then isolated and sequenced to confirm the deletion of the introns. The re-designed paper wasp phospholipase A<sub>1 </sub>cDNA was then removed from the particular plasmid, sequenced, amplified, and cloned into an expression vector, using the procedures described in Example 1 and in Application Ser. No. 08/474,853 and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,593,877, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.</p>A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of paper wasp phospholipase A<sub>1 </sub>(SEQ ID NO:64) with other vespid venom phospholipases was performed. In particular, SEQ ID NO:64 was compared with phospholipase from white face hornet (D. maculata) (SEQ ID NO:17) and phospholipase from yellowjacket (V. vulgaris) (SEQ ID NO:27). The results of this sequence comparison are shown in FIG. 12.</p>EXAMPLE 4WHITE FACE HORNET HYALURONIDASEHyaluronidase is one of the three major allergens from white face hornet venom. It is a protein of about 43 kD as estimated by SDS gel electrophoresis (King et al., 1978, Biochem. 17:5165-74). Its enzymatic specificity is of the endo-N-acetylhexosaminidase type (King et al., 1985, Allergy Clin. Immunol. 75:621-628), as it catalyzes the release of reducing groups of N-acetylglucosamine from hyaluronic acid, which is a polymer of repeating disaccharides of D-glucuronic acid and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine.</p>Partial amino acid sequence data were obtained by Edman degradation of the intact protein and its S. aureus protease digested peptides. Two degenerate oligonucleotides, SEQ ID NOS:29 and 31 (Table 2), were synthesized on the basis of partial amino acid sequence data, and they were used as primers in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify, from venom cDNAs, the cDNA specific for these primers. The location of oligonucleotide SEQ ID NO:29 in the protein sequence was known and it encodes residue 8-13 of hyaluronidase (SEQ ID NO:28). The location of oligonucleotide SEQ ID NO:31 was established by comparison of the translated sequence of the PCR product with the partial amino acid sequence data of hyaluronidase, and it encodes residue 40-45 (SEQ ID NO:30).</p>TABLE 2Oligonucleotide primers for cloning and sequencingof hornet hyaluronidaseSEQ.IDNO.PrimerNotes28F<sup>8</sup>\u2003\u2003N\u2003\u2003\u2003I\u2003\u2003\u2003Y\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003W\u2003\u2003\u2003N<sup>13</sup>29CGT GGA TCC TCC AAC/T ATI TAC/T TGG AAPCR for residues 8-45 andsequencing primer.30\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003D<sup>45</sup>G\u2003\u2003\u2003Q\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003F\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003D\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003D<sup>40</sup>31CGT AGA TCT TC ICC T/CTG A/GAA",

Bee venom hyaluronidase-specific antibodies reacted only with the immunogen.</p>Knowledge of the antigenic cross reactivity of these two venom proteins is of clinical interest as it is known that there is an association of vespid and bee sensitivity in patients.</p>EXAMPLE 7EXPRESSION OF FUNCTIONAL HORNET VENOM HYALURONIDASEClone 12 in pCR vector of Table 3 contains the cDNA insert encoding residue 1-331 of hornet hyaluronidase. The cDNA insert is flanked by BamHI and BglII restriction sites at its 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends respectively. The insert was excised from the vector by BamHI and BglII digestion, and inserted into cut pQE12 plasmid with complementary cohesive sites (QIAGEN, Chatsworth, Calif.). Mutation at nucleotide position 199 in clone 12 (A\u2192T), resulting in introduction of phenylalanine for isoleucine (see note to Table 3), fortuitously eliminated a BglII site in the coding region of the hyaluronidase.</p>The recombinant pQE12 plasmid was used to transform competent M15 (pREP) bacteria. On induction of the transformed bacteria with isopropylthiogalactoside, two recombinant proteins of about 43 and 26 kD were expressed. Both proteins were reactive with antibodies specific for hornet hyaluronidase by Western blot. Antibodies used in the Western blot were obtained from the week 9 bleeding of the BALB/c mice as described in Example 4, above.</p>The pQE12 plasmid is designed so that the recombinant protein has the sequence: MRGS-insert-SRH<sub>6</sub>. The presence of the hexa-histidine sequence in the recombinant protein makes possible its purification from other bacterial proteins by metal ion chelation chromatography followed by reversed phase chromatography.</p>The purified recombinant protein was devoid of hyaluronidase activity. Refolding of the recombinant protein in 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM EDTA, and 2 M guanidine hydrochloride in 0.05 M Tris-HCl buffer of pH 7.4 yielded a product having about 50% of the specific activity of native hyaluronidase. The amount of purified recombinant hyaluronidase was calculated by UV absorbance. Since the purified sample contained both the 23 kD and 46 kD proteins, the actual enzymatic activity of the functional recombinant enzyme may be greater than 50% of that of native hyaluronidase.</p>The above experiments strongly support the thesis that the 43 kD recombinant protein is the hornet hyaluronidase. The 26 kD recombinant protein may arise due to initiation of translation 3\u2032 to the desired site. Such internal states may arise where there is a ribosome binding consensus sequence (Shine-Dalgarno sequence) 5\u2032 to an internal ATG or GUG codon.</p>DEPOSIT OF MICROORGANISMSA bacterial strain INF\u03b1F\u2032 containing a recombinant plasmid pCR which has a nucleic acid molecule encoding white face hornet phospholipase, designated WFH-PLA, has been deposited on Mar. 11, 1993 with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Md. 20852, under the provisions of the Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purposes of Patent Procedures, and has been assigned ATCC accession number 69254.</p>The present invention is not to be limited in scope by the microorganisms deposited or the specific embodiments described herein since such embodiments are intended as but single illustrations of one aspect of the invention and any microorganisms which are functionally equivalent are within the scope of this invention.
