    "A498 and Caki-1. </p> The compounds of the disclosure may be used or tested for their use in treating endometriosis by, respectively, administering a pharmaceutically effective amount to a subject in need thereof or using the syngenic mouse model of endometriosis (see Somigliana, E. et al., \"Endometrial ability to implant in ectopic sites can be prevented by interleukin-12 in a murine model of endometriosis\", Hum. Reprod. 1999, 14(12), 2944-2950). The compounds may also be tested for their use in treating endometriosis by using the rat model of endometriosis (see Lebovic, D. I. et al., \"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma induces regression of endometrial explants in a rat model of endometriosis\", Fertil. Steril., 2004, 82 Suppl 3, 1008-1013). </p> Typically, a successful inhibitory therapeutic agent of the activity of CAIX or CAXII individually or any combination of them will meet some or all of the following criteria. Oral availability should be at or above 20% Animal model efficacy is less than about 20 mg/Kg, 2 mg/Kg, 1 mg/Kg, or 0.5 mg/Kg \n\n and the target human dose is between 10 and 250 mg/70 Kg, although doses outside of this range may be acceptable. (\"mg/Kg\" means milligrams of compound per kilogram of body mass of the subject to whom it is being administered). The required dosage should preferably be no more than about once or twice a day or at meal times. The therapeutic index (or ratio of toxic dose to therapeutic dose) should be greater than 10. The IC50 (\"Inhibitory Concentration - 50%\") is a measure of the amount of compound required to achieve 50% inhibition of the kinase activity, over a specific time period, in a kinase activity assay. Any process for measuring the kinase activity of CAIX or CAXII, preferably human CAIX or CAXII, may be utilized to assay the activity of the compounds useful in the methods of the disclosure in inhibiting said CAIX or CAXII activity. Compounds of the disclosure demonstrate an IC50 in a 15 to 60 minute recombinant human assay of preferably less than 10 \u03bc\u039c, less than 5 \u03bc\u039c, less than 2.5 \u03bc\u039c, less than 1 \u03bc\u039c. less than 750 nM, less than 500 nM, less than 250 nM, less than 100 nM, less than 50 nM, and most preferably less than 20 nM. Compounds of the disclosure may show reversible inhibition or irreversible inhibition and preferably do not inhibit other carbonic anhydrases. </p> The activities of the compounds of the disclosure as CAIX or CAXII inhibitors were tested using the recombinant human CAIX or CAXII proteins and employing stopped-flow method for which the procedure is known to someone skilled in the art or as described in Example 29. When tested in this assay, compounds of the disclosure had greater than 50% inhibitory activity at 10 \u03bc\u039c concentration of the test compound, preferably greater than 60% inhibitory activity at 10 \u03bc\u039c concentration of the test compound, more preferably greater than 70% inhibitory activity at 10 \u03bc\u039c concentration of the test compound, and even more preferably greater than 80% inhibitory activity at 10 \u03bc\u039c concentration of the test compound, and the most preferably greater than 90% inhibitory activity at 10 \u03bc\u039c concentration of the test compound, thereby demonstrating that the compounds of the disclosure are potent inhibitors of the activity of CAIX and CAXII. \n\n These results provide the basis for analysis of the structure- activity relationship (SAR) between test compounds and the inhibitory activity of CAIX or CAXII.
