    "viding that number by the total number of nucleotides in the oligonucleotide and multiplying by 100. Therefore, Percentage of Identity = (Matches x 100)/Length of aligned region (e.g. the contiguous nucleotide sequence). Insertions and deletions are not allowed in the calculation the percentage of identity of a contiguous nucleotide sequence. It will be understood that in determining identity, chemical modifications of the nucleobases are disregarded as long as the functional capacity of the nucleobase to form Watson Crick base pairing is retained (e.g. 5- methyl cytosine is considered identical to a cytosine for the purpose of calculating % identity). </p>Hybridization </p> The term\u201chybridizing\u201d or\u201chybridizes\u201d as used herein is to be understood as two nucleic acid strands (e.g. an antisense oligonucleotide or siRNA guide strand and a target nucleic acid) forming hydrogen bonds between base pairs on opposite strands thereby forming a duplex. The affinity of the binding between two nucleic acid strands is the strength of the hybridization. It is often described in terms of the melting temperature (T<sub>m</sub>) defined as the temperature at which half of the oligonucleotides are duplexed with the target nucleic acid. At physiological conditions T<sub>m</sub> is not strictly proportional to the affinity (Mergny and Lacroix, 2003 , Oligonucleotides 13:515- 537). The standard state Gibbs free energy AG\u00b0 is a more accurate representation of binding affinity and is related to the dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) of the reaction by AG\u00b0=-RTIn(K<sub>d</sub>), where R is the gas constant and T is the absolute temperature. Therefore, a very low AG\u00b0 of the reaction between an oligonucleotide and the target nucleic acid reflects a strong hybridization \n\n between the oligonucleotide and target nucleic acid. DQ\u00b0 is the energy associated with a reaction where aqueous concentrations are 1 M, the pH is 7, and the temperature is 37\u00b0C. The hybridization of oligonucleotides to a target nucleic acid is a spontaneous reaction and for spontaneous reactions DQ\u00b0 is less than zero. DQ\u00b0 can be measured experimentally, for example, by use of the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) method as described in Hansen et al., 1965,Chem. Comm. 36-38 and Holdgate et al., 2005, Drug Discov Today. The skilled person will know that commercial equipment is available for AG\u00b0 measurements. DQ\u00b0 can also be estimated numerically by using the nearest neighbor model as described by SantaLucia, 1998, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 95: 1460-1465 using appropriately derived thermodynamic parameters described by Sugimoto et al., 1995, Biochemistry 34:11211-1 1216 and McTigue et al., 2004, Biochemistry 43:5388-5405. In order to have the possibility of modulating its intended nucleic acid target by hybridization, oligonucleotides of the present invention hybridize to a target nucleic acid with estimated DQ\u00b0 values below -10 kcal for oligonucleotides that are 10-30 nucleotides in length.
