    "The VECTASTAIN ABC Kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif.) was used for subsequent steps followed by development of staining with diaminobenzidine (DAB; Dako North America, Carpinteria, Calif.) and sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. The number of DAB-positive cells were counted in six corticomedullary fields (magnification, 200\u00d7) to quantify the macrophage infiltration.</p>For preparation of the frozen sections, kidneys were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4\u00b0 C. for 24 hours and then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS. Embedding was performed in an optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT; Tissue-Tek, Torrance, Calif.), and samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. Frozen samples were cut into 8 \u03bcm-thick sections (Cryomicrotom CM 3050S, Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, Ill.) and the sections were dehydrated and air-dried. To detect cell proliferation, kidneys were collected at 24 hours after AKI and sections were stained with rabbit anti-rat Ki67 (Thermo Scientific, Fremont, Calif.), followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG AlexaFluor 568 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). Sections were washed in PBS, rinsed in water then mounted with Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI to counter-stain the nuclei (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif.). Nonspecific binding was blocked by a 20 min incubation with 10% normal goat serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, Pa.) under room temperature. Control sections were prepared by omitting the primary antibody. The number of Ki-67 positive cells were counted in six corticomedullary fields (magnification, 200\u00d7) to assess proliferation. All histological analysis was performed in a blinded fashion.</p>For the assessment of in vivo cell tacking, frozen sections were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI to counter-stain the nuclei (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif.). All the images (bright field/fluorescence) were visualized using an Olympus BX61 fluorescence microscope (Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan). Images were captured by Retiga-EXi digital camera (Q Image, Surrey, BC, Canada) attached to the microscope and images were acquired using Simple PCI software (Hamamatsu Corporation, Sewickley, Pa.).</p>RNA Extraction and Real-time PCRKidneys were minced and incubated in RNAlater (Ambion, Austin, Tex.) overnight at 4\u00b0 C. and then transferred to \u221280\u00b0 C. The kidney tissue was homogenized and total RNA was isolated using a Qiagen RNAeasy Midi kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA integrity was assessed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and its purity was verified by spectrophotometry. Real-time quantitative PCR was carried out on an ABI Prism AB 7500 (Applied Biosytems, Foster City, Calif.) using a TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix Kit (Applied Biosytems, Foster City, Calif.). Briefly, 1 \u03bcg of DNase-treated total RNA was reverse transcribed using Invitrogen SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). Then samples were hea",
    "gnificant degree of renal injury and exhibited degeneration of tubular structures including severe tubular necrosis, loss of brush border and tubular dilatation. Quantification of this injury/degeneration using the tubular necrosis score demonstrates the extent of tubular damage (3.50\u00b10.79 vs. 0.11\u00b10.32; P&lt;0.0001 control vs. normal kidney). The beneficial effects of ADRCs on restoring renal function were corroborated by histological evidence, showing that ADRC administration markedly reduced the severity of acute tubular necrosis compared with kidneys obtained from control (PBS-treated) animals at 72 hours post-AKI (0.39\u00b10.50 vs. 3.50\u00b10.79; P&lt;0.0001 ADRC vs. control animals).</p>We also show that there was extensive cast formation in the cortex and outer medullar region in control rats, which is almost absent in healthy kidneys. There was a significant reduction in cast formation in those rats treated with ADRCs compared to control rats on post-AKI day 3 (0.75\u00b10.50 vs. 3.97\u00b10.17; P&lt;0.0001 ADRC vs. control animals).</p>ADRC Engraftment in the Injured KidneyADRCs were detected by the presence of DiI-positive cells in the glomeruli as early as 5 minutes after infusion. This staining was still evident at 2 h but declined thereafter with a reduced intensity at 24 hours. However, staining was still detectable within glomeruli at 72 hours after ADRCs administration.</p>ADRCs Promoted Tubular Epithelial Cell ProliferationTubular epithelial cell proliferation was assessed by Ki-67 staining. Abundant Ki-67 positive staining was found in the distal and proximal tubular region of kidneys treated with ADRC at day 1. Ki-67 positive cells were rare in control (PBS-treated) animals (0\u00b11 Ki-67 positive cells/visual field vs. 8\u00b16 Ki-67 positive cells/visual field in control and ADRC animals, respectively; P&lt;0.0001).</p>ADRCs Therapy Significantly Decreased CD68-positive Cell Infiltration</p>Control (PBS-treated) animals exhibited prominent infiltration of CD68-positive cells (a macrophage marker in the tubulointerstitial compartment of the renal cortex and outer medulla in kidneys at 3 days post-AKI, consistent with the acute inflammatory response following I-R injury. In contrast, treatment with ADRCs resulted in a 25-fold decrease in CD68-positive cell infiltration (6\u00b17 vs. 154\u00b175 cells/ visual field in ADRC and control animals, respectively; P&lt;0.0001).</p>ADRCs Treatment Down Regulated Inflammatory Related Gene ExpressionIn order to further evaluate the reasons for reduced CD68-positive cell infiltration after ADRC therapy, the expression of Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 2 (CXCL2) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) was assessed at 2 and 24 h post-AKI. We detected a significant down-regulation of both CXCL2 and IL-6 mRNA expression at 24 hours after AKI in the ADRC treated animals compared with those receiving PBS.</p>"
