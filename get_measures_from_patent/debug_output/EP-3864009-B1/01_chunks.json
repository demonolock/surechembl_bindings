    "3.0&gt;460&lt;3.0&gt;460Compound (3)28.039.253.828.58.8184.94.2335</p>While comparative Compound B exhibits a good half-life in humans (over 2 hours), the data in Table 7 indicate that compounds (2) and (3) of the invention have a significantly reduced rate of clearance in all four hepatocyte stability assays compared to prior art comparative Compound B and that, consequently, the half life (T<sub>1/2</sub>) of the compounds of the invention is even longer in all four assays than the half life of the comparative Compound B.</p>(v) pSTAT3 InhibitionThe compounds (2) and (3) of the invention and prior art comparative Compounds A and B were tested for pSTAT3 inhibition in response to IL-22 stimulation in serum starved HT29 cells.</p>HT29 cells were serum starved overnight before the four test compounds were diluted to generate a 9-point semi-log dose dilution with a top concentration of 10 \u00b5M, plus vehicle control. HT29 cells were incubated with the test compounds for 20 min at 37\u00b0C. HT29 cells were incubated for a further 15 min with 10 ng/ml human IL-22 before cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 10 min, and 90% methanol for 30 min before being labelled with a phospho-STAT3Y705 antibody (CST #9145). Cells were rinsed three times using 0.5% BSA/PBS solution before being incubated with Alexa-488 anti-rabbit secondary antibodies.</p>Mean fluorescence intensity of phospho-STAT3 in single cells was analysed by flow cytometry using an Intellicyt iQue instrument and FlowJo software. The IC50 was determined using a four-parameter analysis following removal of background signal and normalisation to the DMSO control.</p>Results are shown in Table 8 below.\nTable 8Test CompoundIC<sub>50</sub>(nM)%pSTAT3 inhibition at 10\u00b5MComparative Compound A17096.9Comparative Compound B5397.9Compound (2)1695.9Compound (3)231.195.9</p>While both comparative Compound B and Compound (2) were shown to have IC<sub>50</sub>values against pSTAT3 inhibition of less than 100nM, the IC<sub>50</sub>value for Compound (2) was significantly lower than for comparative Compound B.</p>(vi) Human Primary CD4CD45RO+ Cells AssayInhibition of IL-17F production and STAT3 phosphorylation by Compounds (2) and (3) and Comparative Compound B were measured in Th17 cells derived from human peripheral blood CD4CD45RO+ cells.</p>Fresh human Peripheral blood CD4CD45RO+ cells were purchased commercially (Generon, UK); 3 separate vials from 3 different volunteers for experimental replicates. Cells were grown in T-cell medium (Thermo Fisher) containing 10ng/ml recombinant human IL-1B (R&amp;D Systems), IL-23 (R&amp;D Systems), TGF-B1 (R&amp;D Systems) and 50ng/ml IL-6 (R&amp;D Systems) together with anti-CD3/CD28 magnetic Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher). These were grown for 11 days to induce expansion of Th17 cells. Prior to plating for assays cells were grown overnight in T-cell medium supplemented with human serum (1%) overnight. Media was removed and replaced with unsupplemented RPMI for 4h prior to assay.</p>To measure IL-17F levels, 200,000 cells were plated into a 96 well plate and preincubated with compounds for 30 minutes followed by stimulation with recombinant IL-23 at 6.25ng/ml and recombinant human IL-1B at 0.1ng/ml for 48h. Supernatants were removed and IL-17F levels measured using a commercially available ELISA kit (Thermo Fisher; BMS2037-2).</p>To measure pSTAT3 levels, 200,000 cells were plated into a 96 well plate and preincubated with compounds for 30 minutes followed by stimulation with recombinant IL-23 at 12.5ng/ml for 15 minutes then lysed using cell lysis buffer. pSTAT3 levels in the lysates were measured using a commercially available ELISA kit (Thermo Fisher; 85-86102-11).</p>ELISAs were carried out according to manufacturers instructions and absorbance read using a microplate reader (Thermo Fisher; Varioskan). Data was normalised to the response in untreated samples using the formula: % of control = ((Stimulated sample Conc,. - unstimulated sample Conc.) \u00d7 100)/(Control stimulated Conc. - control unstimulated Conc.)</p>Graphpad Prism 8.1.0 was used to calculate IC50 values using a Nonlinear 4 parameter logistic regression model (4PL).</p>The results are shown in Tables 9A and 9B below:\nTable 9A - IL17-F Production InhibitionCompoundDonor 1Donor 2Donor 3Average (nM)SDComparative Compound B24321714820349Compound (2)1171346410537Compound (3)57548105237271\nTable 9B - Inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylationCompoundDonor 1Donor 2Donor 3Average (nM)SDComparative Compound B11117546147Compound (2)6929555120Compound (3)15729919264</p>While all tested compounds showed inhibition of IL17-F production and STAT3 phosphorylation, in both assays Compound (2) was shown to be more active than comparative Compound B and Compound (3).</p>Comparative Data - ConclusionsThe data obtained from assays (i) to (vi) above indicate that the compounds of the invention have significant advantages over the structurally most similar compound (Compound B) in WO2015/032423</patcit>.</p>Thus, both compounds (2) and (3) are more active than Compound B in the TYK2 kinase inhibition assay and both have greater selectivity for TYK2 versus JAK1, JAK2 and JAK3 kinases than Compound B.</p>Compounds (2) and (3) have slightly advantageous properties compared to prior art comparative Compound B in the cytochrome P450 assays, notably in the CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 assays.</p>Compounds (2) and (3) have a reduced hERG liability compared to prior art comparative Compound B.</p>In the hepatocyte stability assays, Compounds (2) and (3) showed a reduced rate of clearance and a consequently long"
