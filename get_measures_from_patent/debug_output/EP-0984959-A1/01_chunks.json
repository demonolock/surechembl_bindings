    " AROMATIC SULFONYL ALPHA-HYDROXY HYDROXAMIC ACID COMPOUNDS</p>Description Technical Field</p>This invention is directed to proteinase (protease) inhibitors, and more particularly to aromatic sulfonyl alpha-hydroxy hydroxamic acid compounds that are useful, inter alia, as inhibitors for matrix metalloproteinases, compositions of those compounds, intermediates for the syntheses of the compounds, processes for the preparation of the compounds and processes for treating pathological conditions associated with pathological matrix metalloproteinase activity.</p>Background of the Invention</p>Connective tissue, extracellular matrix constituents and basement membranes are required components of all mammals. These components are the biological materials that provide rigidity, differentiation, attachments and, in some cases, elasticity to biological systems including human beings and other mammals. Connective tissues components include, for example, collagen, elastin, proteoglycans, fibronectin and laminin. These biochemicals make up, or are components of structures, such as skin, bone, teeth, tendon, cartilage, basement membrane, blood vessels, cornea and vitreous humor. Under normal conditions, connective tissue turnover and/or repair processes are controlled and in \n\nequilibrium. The loss of this balance for whatever reason is involved in a number of disease states. Inhibition of the enzymes responsible for a loss of equilibrium provides a control mechanism for this tissue decomposition and, therefore, a treatment for these diseases.</p>Degradation of connective tissue or connective tissue components is carried out by the action of proteinase enzymes released from resident tissue cells and/or invading inflammatory or tumor cells. A major class of enzymes involved in this function are the zinc metalloproteinases (metalloproteases, or MMPs) .</p>The metalloprotease enzymes are divided into classes with some members having several different names in common use. Examples are: collagenase I (MMP- 1, fibroblast collagenase; EC 3.4.24.3); collagenase II (MMP-8, neutrophil collagenase; EC 3.4.24.34), collagenase III (MMP-13), stromelysin 1 (MMP-3; EC 3.4.24.17), stromelysin 2 (MMP-10; EC 3.4.24.22), proteoglycanase, matrilysin (MMP-7) , gelatinase A (MMP-2, 72kDa gelatinase, basement membrane collagenase; EC 3.4.24.24), gelatinase B (MMP- 9, 92kDa gelatinase; EC 3.4.24.35), stromelysin 3 (MMP-11) , metalloelastase (MMP-12, HME, human macrophage elastase) and membrane MMP (MMP-14) . MMP is an abbreviation or acronym representing the term Matrix Metalloprotease with the attached numerals providing differentiation between specific members of the MMP group .</p>The uncontrolled breakdown of connective tissue by metalloproteases is a feature of many \n\npathological conditions. Examples include rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, septic arthritis; corneal, epidermal or gastric ulceration; tumor metastasis, invasion or angiogenesis; periodontal disease; proteinuria; multiple sclerosis; Alzheimer's Disease; coronary thrombosis and bone disease. Defective injury repair processes can also occur. This can produce improper wound healing leading to weak repairs, adhesions and scarring. These latter defects can lead to disfigurement and/or permanent disabilities as with post-surgical adhesions.</p>Matrix metalloproteases are also involved in the biosynthesis of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and inhibition of the production or action of TNF and related compounds is an important clinical disease treatment mechanism. TNF-\u03b1, for example, is a cytokine that at present is thought to be produced initially as a 28 kD cell-associated molecule. It is released as an active, 17 kD form that can mediate a large number of deleterious effects in vi tro and in vivo . For example,</p>TNF can cause and/or contribute to the effects of inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune disease, multiple sclerosis, graft rejection, fibrotic disease, cancer, infectious diseases, malaria, mycobacterial infection, meningitis, fever, psoriasis, cardiovascular/pulmonary effects such as post-ischemic reperfusion injury, congestive heart failure, hemorrhage, coagulation, hyperoxic alveolar injury, radiation damage and acute phase responses like those seen with infections and sepsis and during shock such as septic shock and hemodynamic shock. Chronic release \n\nof active TNF can cause cachexia and anorexia. TNF can be lethal .</p>TNF-\u03b1 convertase is a metalloproteinase involved in the formation of active TNF-\u03b1. Inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 convertase inhibits production of active TNF- \u03b1. Compounds that inhibit both MMPs activity have been disclosed in IPO International Publication Nos . WO 94/24140, WO 94/02466 and WO 97/20824. There remains a need for effective MMP and TNF-\u03b1 convertase inhibiting agents. Compounds that inhibit MMPs such as collagenase, stromelysin and gelatinase have been shown to inhibit the release of TNF (Gearing et al . Nature 376. 555-557 (1994), McGeehan et al . , Nature 3_1\u00a3, 558- 561 (1994) ) . MMPs are involved in other biochemical processes in mammals as well. Included is the control of ovulation, post-partum uterine involution, possibly implantation, cleavage of APP (\u03b2-Amyloid Precursor Protein) to the amyloid plaque and inactivation of \u03b1^-protease inhibitor (\u03b1 -PI) . Inhibition of these metalloproteases permits the control of fertility and the treatment or prevention of Alzheimers Disease. In addition, increasing and maintaining the levels of an endogenous or administered serine protease inhibitor drug or biochemical such as \u03b1^-PI supports the treatment and prevention of diseases such as emphysema, pulmonary diseases, inflammatory diseases and diseases of aging such as loss of skin or organ stretch and resiliency. Inhibition of selected MMPs can also be desirable in other instances. Treatment of cancer \n\nand/or inhibition of metastasis and/or inhibition of angiogenesis are examples of approaches to the treatment of diseases wherein the selective inhibition of stromelysin (MMP-3) , gelatinase (MMP-2) , gelatinase B (MMP-9) or collagenase III (MMP-13) are the relatively most important enzyme or enzymes to inhibit especially when compared with collagenase I (MMP-1) . A drug that does not inhibit collagenase I can have a superior therapeutic profile. Osteoarthritis, another prevalent disease wherein it is believed that cartilage degradation in inflamed joints is at least partially caused by MMP-13 released from cells such as stimulated chrondrocytes, may be best treated by administration of drugs one of whose modes of action is inhibition of MMP-13. See, for example, Mitchell et al . , J. Clin .</p>Invest . , 22. : 761-768 (1996) and Reboul et al . , J. Clin . Invest . , 22:2011-2019 (1996).</p>Inhibitors of metalloproteases are known. Examples include natural biochemicals such as tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) , \u03b1<sub>2</sub>-macroglobulin and their analogs or derivatives. These are high molecular weight protein molecules that form inactive complexes with metalloproteases. A number of smaller peptide-like compounds that inhibit metalloproteases have been described. Mercaptoamide peptidyl derivatives have shown ACE inhibition in vi tro and in vivo . Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) aids in the production of angiotensin II, a potent pressor substance in mammals and inhibition of this enzyme leads to the lowering of blood pressure.</p>Thiol group-containing amide or peptidyl amide-based metalloprotease (MMP) inhibitors are known \n\nas is shown in, for example, W095/12389, WO96/11209 and U.S. 4,595,700. Hydroxamate group-containing MMP inhibitors are disclosed in a number of published patent applications such as WO 95/29892, WO 97/24117, WO 97/49679 and EP 0 780 386 that disclose carbon backboned compounds, and WO 90/05719, WO 93/20047, WO 95/09841 and WO 96/06074 that disclose hydroxamates that have a peptidyl back-bones or peptidomimetic backbones, as does the article by Schwartz et al . , Progr. Med. Chem. , 25:271-334(1992) and those of Rasmussen et al . , Pharmacol . Ther. , 75 (1) : 69-75 (1997) and Denis et al., Invest. New Drugs, 15 (3) : 175-185 (1997).</p>One possible problem associated with known MMP inhibitors is that such compounds often exhibit the same or similar inhibitory effects against each of the MMP enzymes. For example, the peptidomimetic hydroxamate known as batimastat is reported to exhibit IC50 values of about 1 to about 20 nanomolar (nM) against each of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-7, and MMP-9. Marimastat, another peptidomimetic hydroxamate was reported to be another broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor with an enzyme inhibitory spectrum very similar to batimastat, except that marimastat exhibited an IC50 value against MMP-3 of 230 nM. Rasmussen et al . , Pharmacol . Ther. , 75 (1) : 69-75 (1997).</p>Meta analysis of data from Phase I/II studies using marimastat in patients with advanced, rapidly progressive, treatment-refractory solid tumor cancers (colorectal, pancreatic, ovarian, prostate) indicated a dose-related reduction in the rise of cancer-specific antigens used as surrogate markers for biological activity. Although marimastat exhibited some measure \n\nof efficacy via these markers, toxic side effects were noted. The most common drug-related toxicity of marimastat in those clinical trials was musculoskeletal pain and stiffness, often commencing in the small joints in the hands, spreading to the arms and shoulder. A short dosing holiday of 1-3 weeks followed by dosage reduction permits treatment to continue. Rasmussen et al . , Pharmacol . Ther. , 75 (1 ) : 69-75 (1997) . It is thought that the lack of specificity of inhibitory effect among the MMPs may be the cause of that effect.</p>In view of the importance of hydroxamate MMP inhibitor compounds in the treatment of several diseases and the lack of enzyme specificity exhibited by two of the more potent drugs now in clinical trials, it would be a great benefit if hydroxamates of greater enzyme specificity could be found. This would be particularly the case if the hydroxamate inhibitors exhibited strong inhibitory activity against one or more of MMP-2, MMP-9 or MMP-13 that are associated with several pathological conditions, while at the same time exhibiting limited inhibition of MMP-1, an enzyme that is relatively ubiquitous and known to participate in a number of homeostatic processes. The disclosure that follows describes one family of hydroxamate MMP inhibitors that exhibit those desirable activities.</p>Brief Summary of the Invention</p>The present invention is directed to a family of molecules that inter alia inhibit matrix metalloprotease (MMP) activity, and particularly inhibit the activity of one or more of MMP-2, MMP-9, or \n\nMMP-13, while generally exhibiting little activity against MMP-1, as well as a process for treating a mammal having a condition associated with pathological activity.</p>Briefly, one embodiment of the present invention is directed to an aromatic sulfonyl alpha- hydroxy hydroxamic acid compound.

R<sup>1</sup> is a substituent that contains a 5- or 6- membered cyclohydrocarbyl, heterocyclo, aryl or heteroaryl radical bonded directly to the depicted SO2- group and having a l",
    "cal or drawn through the SO2 -bonded 1 -position and the center of 3, 4 -bond of a 5-membered ring radical, whose widest dimension in a direction transverse to the axis of rotation is about that of one furanyl ring to about that of two phenyl rings .</p>R<sup>1</sup> preferably contains a single aromatic or heteroaromatic ring that is itself substituted with another substituent, R<sup>3</sup>. R<sup>1</sup> most preferably contains a phenyl ring, Ph, that is itself has a substituent, R<sup>3</sup> , at the 4 -position. R<sup>3</sup> is preferably a phenyl, a phenoxy, a phenylazo, a thiophenoxy, an anilino, a benzamido, a nicotinamido, an isonicotinamido, a picolinamido or an ureidophenyl group that can itself be substituted at the meta- or para-position or both by a single atom or a substituent containing a longest chain of up to eight atoms, excluding hydrogen. A process for treating a host mammal having a condition associated with pathological matrix metalloprotease activity is also contemplated. That process comprises administering a compound described hereinbefore in an enzyme-inhibiting effective amount to a mammalian host having such a condition. The use of repeated administrations is particularly contemplated .</p>Among the several benefits and advantages of the present invention are the provision of compounds and compositions effective as inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase activity, and the provision of such \n\ncompounds and compositions that are effective for the inhibition of metalloproteinases implicated in diseases and disorders involving uncontrolled breakdown of connective tissue. More particularly, a benefit of this invention is the provision of a compound and composition effective for inhibiting metalloproteinases, particularly MMP-13 and/or MMP-2, associated with pathological conditions such as, for example, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, septic arthritis; corneal, epidermal or gastric ulceration; tumor metastasis, invasion or angiogenesis; periodontal disease; proteinuria; multiple sclerosis; Alzheimer's Disease; coronary thrombosis and bone disease. An advantage of the invention is the provision of a method for preparing such compositions. Another benefit is the provision of a method for treating a pathological condition associated with abnormal matrix metalloproteinase activity. Another advantage of the invention is the provision of compounds, compositions and methods effective for treating such pathological conditions by selective inhibition of a metalloproteinase such as MMP-13 and MMP-2 associated with such conditions with minimal side effects resulting from inhibition of other proteinases such as MMP-1, whose activity is necessary or desirable for normal body function.</p>Still further benefits and advantages of the invention will be apparent to the skilled worker from the disclosure that follows. \n\nDetailed Description of Preferred Embodiments</p>In accordance with the present invention, it has been found that certain aromatic sulfonyl alpha- hydroxy hydroxamic acids (hydroxamates) are effective for inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (\"MMPs\") believed to be associated with uncontrolled or otherwise pathological breakdown of connective tissue. In particular, it has been found that these certain aromatic sulfonyl alpha-hydroxy hydroxamic acids are effective for inhibition of collagenase III (MMP-13) and also gelatinase A (MMP-2) , which can be particularly destructive to tissue if present or generated in abnormal quantities or concentrations, and thus exhibit a pathological activity. Moreover, it has been discovered that many of these aromatic sulfonyl alpha-hydroxy hydroxamic acids are selective in the inhibition of MMP-13, as well as other MMPs associated with diseased conditions without excessive inhibition of other collagenases essential to normal bodily function such as tissue turnover and repair. More particularly, it has been found that particularly preferred the aromatic sulfonyl alpha- hydroxy hydroxamic acids are particularly active in inhibiting of MMP-13 and MMP-2, while having a limited or minimal effect on MMP-1. This point is discussed in detail hereinafter and is illustrated in the Inhibition Tables hereinafter.</p>A contemplated compound corresponds to Formula I, below: \n\n \n\n</p>wherein</p>R<sup>2</sup> is a hydrido, C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> hydrocarbyl, hydroxy- C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> hydrocarbyl, C<sub>2.</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> hydrocarbyloxy, halo-C\u03b9-C<sub>4</sub> hydrocarbyl, C1-C<sub>4</sub> hydrocarbyloxymethyl, aminomethyl (NH CH<sub>2</sub>-), {<sup>'</sup>N-C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>3</sub> hydrocarbyl) aminomethyl, (N,N-di- C<sub>1</sub>-C3 hydrocarbyl) aminomethyl [ (N-C<sub>1</sub>-C3 hydrocarbyl) , (N-C<sub>1</sub>-C3 hydrocarbyl) aminomethyl] , (N- morpholino) methyl (OC4H8NCH2-) , (N-pyrrolidino) methyl (C<sub>4</sub>H8NCH2-) , or (N-thiomorpholino) methyl (SC<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub>NCH2-) group. In particularly preferred practice, R<sup>2</sup> substituent is a methyl, hydroxymethyl, (N- morpholino) methyl or methoxymethyl group. R<sup>1</sup> is a substituent containing a 5- or 6-membered cyclohydrocarbyl, heterocyclo, aryl or heteroaryl radical bonded directly to the depicted SO2-group and having a length equivalent to a length that is greater than about that of a fully extended hexyl group and less than about that of a fully extended eicosyl group.</p>In addition, R<sup>1</sup> defines a three-dimensional volume, when rotated about an axis drawn through the SO2 -bonded 1-position and the 4-position of a 6-membered ring radical or drawn through the SO2-bonded 1-position and \n\nthe center of 3, 4 -bond of a 5-membered ring radical, whos",
    "and 4 -picolinamido . Exemplary particularly preferred R<sup>3</sup> groups contain a six-membered aromatic ring and include a phenyl group, a phenoxy group, a thiophenoxy group, a phenylazo group, an ureidophenyl group, an anilino group, a nicotinamido group, an isonicotinamido group, a picolinamido group and a benzamido group.</p>In one embodiment of a particularly preferred aromatic sulfonyl alpha-hydroxy hydroxamate compound, an R<sup>3</sup> substituent is a phenyl, phenoxy, anilino or thiophenoxy group that is itself optionally substituted at its own meta or para-position or both with a moiety that is selected from the group consisting of a halogen, a C -Cg hydrocarbyloxy (-0-C<sub>]</sub>_-Cg hydrocarbyl) group, a C\u03c7-C\u03c4<sub>.</sub>0 hydrocarbyl group, a di-C^-Cg hydrocarbylamino [-N(C<sub>]</sub>_-Cg hydrocarbyl) (C;<sub>]</sub>_-Cg hydrocarbyl) ] group, a carboxyl C^-Cg hydrocarbyl (C<sub>]</sub>_- Cg hydrocarbyl-CO2H) group, a C\u00b1 - \u039b. hydrocarbyloxy carbonyl C;L-C4 hydrocarbyl [C1-C<sub>4</sub> hydrocarbyl-0- (CO) - C;\u03b9_-C<sub>4</sub> hydrocarbyl] group, a C1-C<sub>4</sub> hydrocarbyloxycarbonyl C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> hydrocarbyl [C<sub>1</sub>-C4 hydrocarbyl (CO) -0-C\u03b7_-C4 hydrocarbyl] group and a C<sub>]</sub>_-Cg hydrocarbyl carboxamido [-NH (CO) -C^-Cg hydrocarbyl] group, or is substituted at the meta- and para- positions by two methyl groups or by a C -C2 alkylenedioxy group such as a methylenedioxy group. These compounds generally exhibit good activities (IC50 values of about 0.1-60 nM) against MMP-2, MMP-9 and MMP-13, while exhibiting substantially less activity toward MMP-1 (IC<sub>50</sub> values of about 1000 to &gt;10,000 nM) . \n\nAn unsubstituted phenoxy or thiophenoxy R<sup>3</sup> substituent is presently preferred.</p>In another embodiment of a particularly preferred aromatic sulfonyl alpha-hydroxy hydroxamate compound, a R<sup>3</sup> substituent is benzamido, nicotinamido, isonicotinamido, picolinamido or ureidophenyl in which the substituent ring (benzamido, nicotinamido, isonicotinamido, picolinamido or ureidophenyl group) is unsubstituted or is itself (optionally) substituted at its own meta- or para-position. A preferred substituent moiety on the substituent ring is selected from the group consisting of a halogen, a nitro, a C<sub>]</sub>_-</p>Cg hydrocarbyl, C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>7</sub> hydrocarbyloxy, a C;L-C2 alkylenedioxy, an amino, an N-C2-C<sub>4</sub>-hydroxyalkyl-amino [ e.g., -NH(C<sub>4</sub>HgOH)] and an N,N-C2-C<sub>4</sub>-hydroxyalkylamino [ e.g., -N(C2H<sub>4</sub>\u03b8H)2] group. Some of these compounds exhibit more than a 100, 000-fold difference in in vi tro inhibitory activity against MMP-2 and MMP-1, and an about 2- to about 100-fold activity enhancement against MMP-2 over MMP-13, while still maintaining nanomolar activity against MMP-2. These compounds exhibited about a 10- to about 100-fold activity difference between MMP-2 and MMP-9. Such compounds illustrate one aspect of the activity and selectivity of inhibition of some of the contemplated compounds.</p>Inasmuch as a contemplated S\u03b82~linked aryl or heteroaryl radical is itself preferably substituted with a six-membered aromatic ring, two nomenclature systems are used together herein for ease in understanding substituent positions. The first system uses position numbers for the ring directly bonded to \n\nthe SO2-group, whereas the second system uses ortho, meta or para for the position of one or more substituents of a six-membered ring bonded to a SO2- linked aryl or heteroaryl radical. When a R<sup>3</sup> substituent is other than a six-membered ring, substituent positions are numbered from the position of linkage to the aromatic or heteroaromatic ring. Formal chemical nomenclature is used in naming particular compounds . Thus, the 1-position of an above-discussed</p>S\u03b82~li ked aryl or heteroaryl radical is the position at which the SO2 -group is bonded to the ring. The 4- and 3 -positions of rings discussed here are numbered from the sites of substituent bonding from the SO2- linkage as compared to formalized ring numbering positions used in heteroaryl nomenclature.</p>The length, width and the number of aromatic rings present in a R<sup>1</sup> substituent bonded to the SO2 group is believed to play a role in the overall activity of a contemplated compound against MMP enzymes generally. The identity of the R<sup>1</sup> substituent group can also play a role in the activity of an compound against particular MMP enzymes. ",
    " IV. The observation of this hydrogen bond was unexpected. The conformation of the bound inhibitor (Example 1A) appears to allow the intramolecular hydrogen bond for only this stereoisomer . That hydrogen bond cannot form from a compound of the opposite configuration while maintaining (a) the orientation of the hydroxamate group toward the metal ion of the enzyme and (b) the position of the R<sup>1</sup> group in the binding pocket of the enzyme. This may account for the better binding of this compound to MMP-13, -2 and -9, compared to a \n\ncompound of the opposite configuration (compound of Example IB) (See Table 51 for enzyme data) .</p>Intramolecular hydrogen bonds are well known to those skilled in the art. Although the S stereoisomer of Example 1A is preferred, both configurations permit this favorable intramolecular interaction in solution. The advantages of such intramolecular hydrogen-bonding for medicaments have been reported by several research groups. See, for example, Smith, et al . J<sup>\"</sup>. med. Che . (1994) 37(2), 215- 218 and Leone-Bay et al . J. Med. Chem . (1996) 39(13), 2571-2578.</p>The data shown in Table 51 illustrate better binding for a compound of the above configuration (compound of Example 1A) to MMP-13, -2 and -9 than a compound of the opposite configuration (compound of Example IB) . Binding of both compounds to MMP-1 was within about a factor of ten. However, because of the better binding of the compound of Example 1A to MMP-13, the ratio of inhibition of MMP-1 to inhibition of MMP-</p>13 was about 2 -times greater for the compound of the above stereoconfiguration (Exhibit 1A compound) than for the compound of opposite configuration. The advantages of such intramolecular hydrogen-bonding for medicaments have been reported by several research groups. See, for example, Smith, et al . , J<sup>\"</sup>. Med. Chem. (1994) 22121,215-218 and Leone-Bay et al . , J<sup>\"</sup>. Med. Chem. (1996) 39(13) .2571-2578.</p>The word \"hydrocarbyl\" is used herein as a short hand term to include straight and branched chain aliphatic as well as alicyclic groups or radicals that contain only carbon and hydrogen. Thus, alkyl, alkenyl \n\nand alkynyl groups are contemplated, whereas aromatic hydrocarbons such as phenyl and naphthyl groups, which strictly speaking are also hydrocarbyl groups, are referred to herein as aryl groups or radicals, as discussed hereinafter. Where a specific aliphatic hydrocarbyl substituent group is intended, that group is recited; i.e., C<sub>1.</sub>-C4 alkyl, methyl or dodecenyl .</p>Exemplary hydrocarbyl groups contain a chain of 1 to about 12 carbon atoms, and preferably one to about 10 carbon atoms. A particularly preferred hydrocarbyl group is an alkyl group.</p>Usual chemical suffix nomenclature is followed when using the word \"hydrocarbyl\" except that the usual practice of removing the terminal \"yl\" and adding an appropriate suffix is not always followed because of the possible similarity of a resulting name to one or more su",

Following the procedures of</p>Knight et al . , FEBS Lett . 296(3) :263 (1992). Briefly, 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA) or trypsin activated MMPs were incubated with various concentrations of the inhibitor compound at room temperature for 5 minutes.</p>More specifically, recombinant human MMP-13 and MMP-1 enzymes were prepared in laboratories of the assignee. MMP-13 was expressed in baculovirus as a proenzyme, and purified first over a heparin agarose column and then over a chelating zinc chloride column. The proenzyme was activated by APMA for use in the assay. MMP-1 expressed in transfected HT-1080 cells was provided by Dr. Howard Welgus of Washington University, St. Louis, MO. The enzyme was also activated using APMA and was then purified over a hydroxamic acid column.</p>The enzyme substrate is a methoxycoumarin- containing polypeptide having the following sequence:</p>MCA-ProLeuGlyLeuDpaAlaArgNH<sup>2</sup>, wherein MCA is methoxycoumarin and Dpa is 3- (2 , 4-dinitrophenyl) -. L-2, 3-diaminopropionyl alanine. This substrate is commercially available from Baychem as product M-1895. The buffer used for assays contained 100 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.05 percent polyethyleneglycol (23) lauryl ether at a pH value of</p>7.5. Assays were carried out at room temperature, and \n\ndimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a final concentration of 1 percent was used to dissolve compound.</p>The assayed inhibitor compound in DMSO/buffer solution was compared to an equal amount of DMSO/buffer with no inhibitor as control using Microfluor\u2122 White Plates (Dynatech) . The inhibitor or control solution was maintained in the plate for 10 minutes and the substrate was added to provide a final concentration of 4 \u03bcM. In the absence of inhibitor activity, a fluorogenic peptide was cleaved at the gly-leu peptide bond, separating the highly fluorogenic peptide from a 2 , 4-dinitrophenyl quencher, resulting in an increase of fluorescence intensity (excitation at 328 nm/emission at 415 nm) . Inhibition was measured as a reduction in fluorescent intensity as a function of inhibitor concentration, using a Perkin Elmer L550 plate reader. The IC50 values were calculated from those values. The results are set forth in the Inhibition Table (Table 51) below, reported in terms of IC^<sub>Q</sub>.</p>TABLE 51</p>IC<sub>50</sub> VALUES (in nM)</p>Example MMP-13 M P-1 MMP-2 MP-3 MMP- 8 MMP- 3</p>1 1.1 1100 0.5 30 2.5 4.8 1A(S) 0.75 1005 0.39 1.7 1B(R) 21.5 &gt;10,000 11.0 328</p>2 1.2 470 1.0 44 4.1 7 \n\n 33 66000000 11..00 166 4 20 0 0..44 9 9000000 0 0..44 48.5 4.5 12.4 1 1..33 &gt; &gt;1100,,000000 2 2..44 26.8 2.5 3.4</p>30 8000 14.8 2 2..11 &gt; &gt;1100,,000000 2 2..00 51.8 4.0 13.0</p>200 &gt;10,000 0 0..22 3 3000000 0 0..44 16.0 1 1..00 4 4000000 0 0..44 18.0 5 5..00 7 7000000 7 7 66.0 3 3..77 &gt; &gt;1100,,000000 2 2..00 175 5 5..00 &gt; &gt;1100,,000000 2 2..33 70.0</p>0.5 &gt;10, 000 &lt;0.1</p>3200 &gt;10,000 87 1 11100 &gt; &gt;1100,,000000 0 0..88 1160</p>900 &gt;10, 000 400</p>13 &gt;10,000 0.5 0,000 &gt;10,000 2600</p>6600 &gt;10,000 300</p>3600 &gt;10,000 34</p>280 &gt;10, 000 6.7 2 22200 &gt; &gt;1100,,000000 2 2..88 1330</p>&lt;0.1 &gt;10,000 &lt;0.1</p>1.2 &gt;10,000 0.2</p>1.2 &gt;10,000 0.1</p>666 &gt;10,000 10.0</p>0.8 &gt;10,000 &lt;0.1</p>80 &gt;10, 000 1.8</p>316 &gt;10,000 20</p>600 &gt;10,000 37.2 \n\n 32 80 &gt;10,000 1.6</p>33 1600 &gt;10,000 50</p>34 1600 &gt;10,000 32.7</p>35 290 &gt;10,000 6.7</p>Example 37: In Vivo Angiogenesis Assay</p>The study of angiogenesis depends on a reliable and reproducible model for the stimulation and inhibition of a neovascular response. The corneal micropocket assay provides such a model of angiogenesis in the cornea of a mouse. See, A Model of Angiogenesis in the Mouse Cornea ; Kenyon,BM, et al . , Investigative Ophthalmology &amp; Visual Science, July 1996, Vol. 37, No.8.</p>In this assay, uniformly sized Hydron\u2122 pellets containing bFGF and sucralfate were prepared and surgically implanted into the stroma mouse cornea adjacent to the temporal limbus. The pellets were formed by making a suspension of 20 \u03bcL sterile saline containing 10 \u03bcg recombinant bFGF, 10 mg of sucralfate and 10 \u03bcL of 12 percent Hydron\u2122 in ethanol. The slurry was then deposited on a 10 x 10 mm piece of sterile nylon mesh. After drying, the nylon fibers of the mesh were separated to release the pellets.</p>The corneal pocket was made by anesthetizing a 7 week old C57B1/6 female mouse, then proptosing the eye with a jeweler's forceps. Using a dissecting microscope, a central, intrastromal linear keratotomy of approximately 0.6 mm in length was performed with a \n\n#15 surgical blade, parallel to the insertion of the lateral rectus muscle. Using a modified cataract knife, a lamellar micropocket was dissected toward the temporal limbus. The pocket was extended to within 1.0 mm of the temporal limbus. A single pellet was placed on the corneal surface at the base of the pocket with a jeweler's forceps. The pellet was then advanced to the temporal end of the pocket. Antibiotic ointment was then applied to the eye. Mice were dosed on a daily basis for the duration of the assay. Dosing of the animals was based on bioavailability and overall potency of the compound. An exemplary dose is 50 mg/kg bid, po. Neovascularization of the corneal stroma begins at about day three and was permitted to continue under the influence of the assayed compound until day five. At day five, the degree of angiogenic inhibition was scored by viewing the neovascular progression with a slit lamp microscope. The mice were anesthetized and the studied eye was once again proptosed. The maximum vessel length of neovascularization, extending from the limbal vascular plexus toward the pellet was measured. In addition, the contiguous circumferential zone of neovascularization was measured as clock hours, where 30 degrees of arc equals one clock hour. The area of angiogenesis was calculated as follows.</p>(0.4 x clock hours x 3.14 x vessel length (in mm)) area = \u2014 \u2014 \n\n The studied mice were thereafter compared to control mice and the difference in the area of neovascularization was recorded. A contemplated compound typically exhibits about 25 to about 75 percent inhibition, whereas the vehicle control exhibits zero percent inhibition. The results of this assay for several inhibitor compounds are shown in Table 52, below.</p>Table 52</p>Percentage of</p>Example Control</p>1 51.9</p>1A(S) 62.7</p>1B(R) 49.3</p>2 53.4</p>3 77.4</p>4 65.2</p>5 57.8</p>9 61.1</p>16 41.6</p>From the foregoing, it will be observed that numerous modifications and variations can be carried out without departing from the true spirit and scope of the novel concepts of the present invention. It is to be understood that no limitation with respect to the specific example presented is intended or should be inferred. The disclosure is intended to cover by the \n\nappended claims all such modifications as fall within the scope of the claims . \n</p>"
