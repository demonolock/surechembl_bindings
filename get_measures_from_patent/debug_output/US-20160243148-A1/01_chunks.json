    " See FIG. 2(A)-(E). Quantitative analysis showed that acute UDP treatment led to a 12.6% reduction in the number of plaques (P&lt;0.01) and a 17.2% reduction in plaque load (P&lt;0.01) in barrel cortex as assessed by two-photon microscopy. Individual identified plaques that were detected on the second imaging session showed an 18.2% reduction (P&lt;0.01) in cross-sectional area following UDP treatment.</p>After repeated imaging, brains were fixed and subjected to postmortem immunohistochemistry with amyloid beta specific antibodies \u03b21-40 and \u03b21-42 to evaluate the plaque load (area occupied by immunostaining of plaque) in cortex and hippocampus. See FIG. 3(A)-(D). UDP treatment resulted in a 60% (p&lt;0.05) and 62% (p&lt;0.01) decrease in plaque load in the cortex and hippocampus, respectively, as assessed by staining with the \u03b21-40 antibody. Quantification of staining with \u03b21-42 antibody showed a 48% (P&lt;0.01) and 47% (P&lt;0.05) decrease in plaque load in the cortex and hippocampus, respectively. See FIG. 4(A)-(F). Both in vivo imaging and post hoc staining showed decrease in plaque burden in brains of PSAPP mice, consistent with reduced plaque load in the tested animals following acute administration of UDP (e.g., a P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>6 </sub>receptor agonist).</p>Example 9Activation of P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>6 </sub>Receptors Reduced Plaque Burden in PSAPP Mice3-phenacyl-UDP (also referred to as PSB0474) is a potent and selective P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>6 </sub>receptor agonist (EC50=70 nM, &gt;500-fold selective). In this study, P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>6 </sub>receptor was activated in vivo using 3-phenacyl-UDP (PSB0474). The effect of this activation may have on plaque burden was also evaluated.</p>PSB0474 was systemically administered to PSAPP mice via intraperitoneal injection for 2, 4 and 6 consecutive days. In one group, prior to evaluation and following to administration for 6 consecutive days, treatment was suspended for two weeks (6+2 weeks group). Brains were then fixed and plaque load was evaluated by immunostaining with the amyloid beta specific antibodies: \u03b21-40 and \u03b21-42. Representative images of plaque load in cortex and hippocampus from animals that received injections of PSB0474 according to the foregoing injection schedules are shown in FIG. 5(A)-(D). Quantitative data showed that administration of PSB0474 for 4 and 6 consecutive days significantly decreased immunoreactivity of \u03b21-40 in both cortex and hippocampus (FIG. 6(A) and 6(B)). Whereas, when administration of PSB0474 was stopped for 2 weeks following six consecutive days of treatment (denoted as the 6+2 weeks group), \u03b21-40 staining rebounded; although to a level lower than observed in mice treated with saline as a vehicle control. FIGS. 6A and 6B depict the reduction in plaque load (%) the cortex and hippocampus, respectively, in PSAPP mice after treatment with 3-phenacyl-UDP for 2, 4, or 6 consecutive days, as assayed by staining with the \u03b21-40 antibody.
