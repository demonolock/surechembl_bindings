{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n* In one embodiment, the growth inhibitory antibody of choice is able to inhibit growth of SK-BR-3 cells in cell culture by about 20-100% and preferably by about 50-100% at an antibody concentration of about 0.5 to 30 \u03bcg/ml.\n* Those antibodies which inhibit growth of the SK-BR-3 cells by about 20- 100% or about 50-100% may be selected as growth inhibitory antibodies.\n* Following a three day incubation period, monolayers are washed with PBS and detached by trypsinization, then receive labeled annexin (e.g. annexin V-FTIC) (1 \u03bcg/ml).\n* In order to perform this assay, BT474 cells which have been treated with the antibody of interest as described in the preceding two paragraphs are incubated with 9\u03bcg/ml HOECHST 33342\u2122 for 2 hr at 37\u00b0 C, then analyzed on an EPICS ELITE\u2122 flow cytometer (Coulter Corporation) using MODFIT LT\u2122 software (Verity Software House).\n* Antibodies which induce a change in the percentage of apoptotic cells which is 2 fold or greater (and preferably 3 fold or greater) than untreated cells (up to 100% apoptotic cells) may be selected as pro-apoptotic antibodies using this assay."}
