    " more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, parental myeloma cells. For example, if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine \n\n(HAT medium), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.</p>\n  Preferred myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level production of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. Among these, preferred myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines, such as those derived from MOPC-21 and MPC- 11 mouse tumors available from the SaIk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, California USA, and SP-2 or X63- Ag8-653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Maryland USA. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor, /. Immunol., 133:3001 (1984); and Brodeur et al, Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987)). Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA).</p>\n  The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson et al, Anal. Biochem., 107:220 (1980).</p>\n  After hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity, affinity, and/or activity, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (Goding,</p>\n  Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, pp.59-103 (Academic Press, 1986)). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, D-MEM or RPMI- 1640 medium. In addition, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal.</p>\n  The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium, ascites fluid, or serum by conventional antibody purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography.</p>\n  DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures {e.g. , by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the</p>\n  DNA may be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as E. coli ",
    "R3 in both MCF7 and SK-BR-3 cells as determined in a co-immunoprecipitation experiment such as that described in Example 2 substantially more effectively than monoclonal antibody 4D5 , and preferably substantially more effectively than monoclonal antibody 7F3.</p>\n  To identify growth inhibitory HER2 antibodies, one may screen for antibodies which inhibit the growth of cancer cells which overexpress HER2. In one embodiment, the growth inhibitory antibody of choice is able to inhibit growth of SK-BR-3 cells in cell culture by about 20-100% and preferably by about 50-100% at an antibody concentration of about 0.5 to 30 \u03bcg/ml. To identify such antibodies, the SK-BR-3 assay described in U.S. Patent \n\nNo. 5,677,171 can be performed. According to this assay, SK-BR-3 cells are grown in a 1: 1 mixture of Fl 2 and DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine and penicillin streptomycin. The SK-BR-3 cells are plated at 20,000 cells in a 35mm cell culture dish (2mls/35mm dish). 0.5 to 30 \u03bcg/ml of the HER2 antibody is added per dish. After six days, the number of cells, compared to untreated cells are counted using an electronic COULTER\u2122 cell counter. Those antibodies which inhibit growth of the SK-BR-3 cells by about 20- 100% or about 50-100% may be selected as growth inhibitory antibodies. See US Pat No. 5,677,171 for assays for screening for growth inhibitory antibodies, such as 4D5 and 3E8.</p>\n  In order to select for antibodies which induce apoptosis, an annexin binding assay using BT474 cells is available. The BT474 cells are cultured and seeded in dishes as discussed in the preceding paragraph. The medium is then removed and replaced with fresh medium alone or medium containing lO\u03bcg/ml of the monoclonal antibody. Following a three day incubation period, monolayers are washed with PBS and detached by trypsinization. Cells are then centrifuged, resuspended in Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding buffer and aliquoted into tubes as discussed above for the cell death assay. Tubes then receive labeled annexin (e.g. annexin V-FTIC) (1 \u03bcg/ml). Samples may be analyzed using a FACSCAN\u2122 flow cytometer and FACSCONVERT\u2122 CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). Those antibodies which induce statistically significant levels of annexin binding relative to control are selected as apoptosis-inducing antibodies. In addition to the annexin binding assay, a DNA staining assay using BT474 cells is available. In order to perform this assay, BT474 cells which have been treated with the antibody of interest as described in the preceding two paragraphs are incubated with 9\u03bcg/ml HOECHST 33342\u2122 for 2 hr at 37<sup>0</sup>C, then analyzed on an EPICS ELITE\u2122 flow cytometer (Coulter Corporation) using MODFIT LT\u2122 software (Verity Software House). Antibodies which induce a change in the percentage of apoptotic cells which is 2 fold or greater (and preferably 3 fold or greater) than untreated cells (up to 100% apoptotic cells) may be selected as pro-apoptotic antibodies using this assay. See WO98/17797 for assays for screening for antibodies which induce apoptosis, such as 7C2 and 7F3.</p>\n  To screen for antibodies which bind to an epitope on HER2 bound by an antibody of interest, a routine cross-blocking assay such as that described in Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988), can be performed to assess whether the antibody cross-blocks binding of an antibody, such as 2C4 or Pertuzumab, to HER2. Alternatively, or additionally, epitope mapping can be performed by methods known in the art (see, e.g. Figs. IA and IB herein) and/or one can study the antibody-HER2 structure (Franklin et al. Cancer Cell 5:317-328 (2004)) to see what domain(s) of HER2 is/are bound by the antibody. (ix) Immunoconjugates</p>\n  The invention also pertains to immunoconjugates comprising an antibod"
