    "platelet-rich plasma resulted in an immediate dose-dependent platelet aggregation caused by the accumulation of ADP, followed by a slow desaggregation attributable to its hydrolysis to AMP. In the absence of ATPDase, ATP did not induce any aggregation while ADP initiate an irreversible aggregation which extent is limited by the ADPase activity of the enzyme. ATPDase also attenuated the aggregation elicited by thrombin and collagen but not by PAF (Platelet Activating Factor), the first two agonists having an effect mediated by platelet ADP release. It was therefore suggested that ATPDase had a dual role in regulating platelet activation. By converting ATP released from damaged vessel cells into ADP, the enzyme induced platelet aggregation at the sites of vascular injury. By converting ADP released from aggregated platelets and/or from hemolyzed red blood cells to AMP, the ATPDase could inhibit or reverse platelet activation, and consequently limit the growth of platelet thrombus at the site of injury. In their attempt to further characterize the aorta ATPDase, the present inventors have developed a new process for producing highly purified ATPDases. They have established a procedure by which its specific activity can be increased over and above the activity of a crude cell preparation by more than 10000-fold. They also discover that the purified enzyme (the catalytic unit) had a molecular weight different from the one previously reported for the native form of the enzyme (190 KD by using the irradiation technique), suggesting that the enzyme may exist in a multimeric form in its native state. Partial amino acid sequences of both bovine aorta and porcine pancreatic ATPases have been obtained.</p>In a completely different field, Maliszenski et al. (1994) have published the sequence of a human lymphoid cell activation antigen designated CD39. Another group (Christoforidis et al. 1995) described the purification of a human placenta ATPDase of a molecular weight of 82 KDa. Its partial amino acid sequence shows a high degree of homology with CD39.</p>When the above mentioned partial amino acid sequences were entered in GenBank for verifying the presence of any homologous sequence, complete homology was surprisingly found for some of these fragments with the CD39 gene product. The complete sequences of the ATPDases remain to be obtained. Assuming that CD39 is an up to date unknown ATPDase, a process for producing ATPDases by recombinant technology is now possible, and CD39 can now be used to reduce platelet aggregation and thrombogenicity.</p>STATEMENT OF THE INVENTIONIt is an object of the present invention to provide two ATPDases isolated from bovine aorta and porcine pancreas, which enzymes have a molecular weight for their catalytic unit of about 78 and 54 Kilodaltons, respectively. A novel process for obtaining a highly purified ATPDase is also an object of the present invention. This process has been successfully applied to the purification of both"
