In one embodiment, the protein is an antibody that inhibits G-CSF-induced proliferation of hG-CSFR-expressing BaF3 cells with an IC50 of at least about 0.5 nM.</p>Single domain antibodies</p>In some embodiments, the compounds of the invention are proteins that are or comprise single domain antibodies (which may be used interchangeably with the terms \"domain antibody\" or \"dAb\"). A single domain antibody is a single polypeptide chain comprising all or part of the heavy chain variable domain of an antibody. In certain embodiments, the single domain antibody is a human single domain antibody (Domantis, Inc., Waltham, MA; see, e.g., US 6248516).</p>Binary, ternary and quaternary</p>In some embodiments, the proteins of the invention are or comprise dimeric, trimeric, tetrameric or higher protein complexes, such as those described in WO98/044001 and/or WO 94/007921.</p>Single chain fv (scFv)</p>One skilled in the art will appreciate that scFv comprise V in a single polypeptide chain<sub>H</sub>And V<sub>L</sub>Zone and V<sub>H</sub>And V<sub>L</sub>A polypeptide linker therebetween that enables the scFv to form the structure required for antigen binding (i.e., the V of a single polypeptide chain)<sub>H</sub>And V<sub>L</sub>Associate with each other to form Fv). For example, the linker comprises more than 12 amino acid residues, of which (Gly)<sub>4</sub>Ser)<sub>3</sub>Is one of the more favorable linkers for scFv.</p>Heavy chain antibodies</p>Heavy chain antibodies differ in structure from many other forms of antibodies, as long as they contain a heavy chain but no light chain. Thus, these antibodies are al",

The reduction of G-CSF exposure to CSL324 was greater when G-CSF was administered before and after administration of CSL324 compared to administration of CSL324 alone.</p>Based on trough concentrations, steady state was not reached after 3 doses of 0.6mg/kg CSL324 at 21 day intervals. Peak mean serum CSL324 concentrations were similar after dose 1 and dose 3.</p>After a single 0.8mg/kg dose of CSL324, no CSL324 could be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid.</p>Pharmacodynamics of medicine</p>Mean ANC decreased after administration of single and repeated doses of CSL324 in the absence of G-CSF challenge when compared to placebo. In single pass CSL3Mean ANC minimum effect at 24 doses (E)<sub>min</sub>) The lowest dose (1.3X 10) was found at the 1.0mg/kg CSL324 dose<sup>9</sup>L), highest in placebo (2.49X 10)<sup>9</sup>L). Mean ANC E after repeated administration of CSL324<sub>min</sub>Reduced to 1 \u00d7 10<sup>9</sup>L, wherein E<sub>min</sub>Occurs after dose 3 (about 48 days).</p>Higher doses of CSL324(0.3 and 0.8mg/kg) inhibited G-CSF-mediated stimulation of elevated ANC; the ANC response to the G-CSF challenge was similar to that of 0.1mg/kg CSL324 and placebo. Based on AUC<sub>0-t</sub>ANC is inversely related to CSL324 dose and CSL324 exposure.</p>CSL324 had no significant effect on neutrophil function when measured ex vivo as neutrophil phagocytic and oxidative burst activity. A higher single dose of CSL324(0.3 to 1.0mg/kg) increased the half maximal effective concentration of G-CSF (EC50) for stimulating neutrophil pSTAT-3 signaling in vitro compared to placebo; however, the assay data shows large variability, limiting interpretation. No consistent effect of CSL324 on the ratio of GM-CSF stimulated to unstimulated neutrophil pSTAT-3 signaling was observed.</p>Neutrophil G-CSF receptor saturation was achieved rapidly with single CSL324 doses of 0.1 to 1.0 mg/kg. The duration of approximately 100% receptor occupancy increased with increasing doses of CSL324, continuing with 0.1mg/kg CSL324 by day 3, and continuing with 0.8 and 1.0mg/kg CSL324 by day 29 (FIG. 2).</p>Single CSL324 dose increased peak serum G-CSF concentration and exposure compared to placebo, where G-CSF AUEC<sub>0-t</sub>And AUEC<sub>0-24</sub>Showing a positive correlation with CSL324 systemic exposure dose and dose. Repeated CSL324 doses resulted in a sustained increase in serum G-CSF with peak concentrations occurring 2 days after each dose. No G-CSF could be detected in cerebrospinal fluid after a single 0.8mg/kg CSL324 dose.</p>Serum concentrations of cytokines and chemokines showed no significant pattern over time after CSL324 administration compared to placebo. Serum Interleukin (IL) -8 concentrations showed a small increase in CSL324 and placebo, indicating the effect of IV infusion. Serum IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) levels increased following G-CSF challenge and then decreased following administration of higher CSL324 doses (0.3 to 1.0 mg/kg).</p>Safety feature</p>Overall, th"
