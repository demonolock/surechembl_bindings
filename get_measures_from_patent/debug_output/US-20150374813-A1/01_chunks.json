The virion contains one or more rod-shaped nucleocapsids containing a molecule of circular supercoiled double-stranded DNA (Mr 54\u00d710<sup>6</sup>-154\u00d710<sup>6</sup>). The virus used as a vector is generally Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NVP). Expression of introduced genes is under the control of the strong promoter that normally regulates expression of the polyhedron protein component of the large nuclear inclusion in which the viruses are embedded in the infected cells.</p>As used herein, the term \u201cderived from\u201d refers to the origin or source, and may include naturally occurring, recombinant, unpurified, or purified molecules. The proteins and molecules of the present invention may be derived from influenza or non-influenza molecules.</p>As used herein the term \u201cfirst\u201d influenza virus protein, i.e., a first influenza virus M1 protein, refers to a protein, such as M1, HA, NA, and M2, that is derived from a particular strain of influenza virus. The strain or type of the first infl",
    "/p>As used herein, the term \u201cmacromolecular protein structure\u201d refers to the construction or arrangement of one or more proteins.</p>As used herein, the term \u201cmultivalent\u201d vaccine refers to a vaccine against multiple types or strains of influenza virus.</p>As used herein, the term \u201cnon-influenza\u201d refers to a protein or molecule that is not derived from influenza virus.</p>As used herein, the term \u201cvaccine\u201d refers to a preparation of dead or weakened pathogens, or of derived antigenic determinants, that is used to induce formation of antibodies or immunity against the pathogen. A vaccine is given to provide immunity to the disease, for example, influenza, which is caused by influenza viruses. The present invention provides vaccine compositions that are immunogenic and provide protection. In addition, the term \u201cvaccine\u201d also refers to a suspension or solution of an immunogen (e.g. VLP) that is administered to a vertebrate to produce protective immunity, i.e., immunity that reduces the severity of disease associated with infection.</p>As used herein the term \u201csubstantial immunity\u201d refers to an immune response in which when VLPs of the invention are administered to a vertebrate there is an induction of the immune system in said vertebrate which results in the prevention of influenza infection, amelioration of influenza infection or reduction of at least one symptom related to influenza virus infection in said vertebrate. Substantial immunity may also refer to a haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer of \u226740 in a mammal wherein the VLPs of the invention have been administered and have induced an immune response.</p>As used herein the term \u201cadjuvant\u201d refers to a compound that, when used in combination with a specific immunogen (e.g. a VLP) in a formulation, augments or otherwise alters or modifies the resultant immune response. Modification of the immune response includes intensification or broadening the specificity of either or both antibody and cellular immune responses. Modification of the immune response can also mean decreasing or suppressing certain antigen-specific immune responses.</p>As used herein the term \u201cimmune stimulator\u201d refers to a compound that enhances an immune response via the body's own chemical messengers (cytokines). These molecules comprise various cytokines, lymphokines and chemokines with immunostimulatory, immunopotentiating, and pro-inflammatory activities, such as interleukins (e.g., IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-12, IL-13); growth factors (e.g., granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-colony stimulating factor (CSF)); and other immunostimulatory molecules, such as macrophage inflammatory factor, Flt3 ligand, B7.1; B7.2, etc. The immune stimulator molecules can be administered in the same formulation as the influenza VLPs, or can be administered separately. Either the protein or an expression vector encoding the protein can be administered to produce an immunostimulatory effect.</p>As used herein an \u201ceffective dose\u201d generally refers to t",
    "n another embodiment, a method to induce substantial immunity to influenza virus infection or at least one symptom thereof in a subject, comprises administering at least one effective dose of an influenza VLP, wherein said VLP consists of avian influenza HA, NA and M1. In another embodiment, said avian influenza HA and NA are H5N1, respectively. In another embodiment, said avian influenza HA and NA are H9N2, respectively. In another embodiment, said avian influenza HA and NA are H7N7, respectively. In another embodiment, said avian influenza HA and/or NA exhibits hemagglutinin activity and/or neuraminidase activity, respectfully. In another embodiment, said subject is a mammal. In another embodiment, said mammal is a human. In a further embodiment, said VLP is formulated with an adjuvant or immune stimulator.</p>In another embodiment, said avian influenza VLPs will induce an immune response in a vertebrate that is about 2 fold, about 4 fold, about 8 fold, about 16 fold, about 32 fold about 64 fold, about 128 fold increase (or higher) more potent than a similar avian influenza antigens formulated similarly to the licensed inactivated vaccines currently licensed for marketing. Current formulations comprise whole inactivated virus (e.g. formaldehyde treated), split virus (chemically disrupted), and subunit (purified glycoprotein) vaccines. Methods for determining potency for a vaccine are known and routine in the art. For example, microneutralization assays and hemagglutination inhibition assays can be performed to determine potency of an avian VLP vaccine compared to avian influenza antigens formulated similar to the licensed inactivated vaccines currently licensed for marketing. In one embodiment, said increase in potency is realized when about 0.2 \u03bcg, about 0.4 \u03bcg, about 0.6 \u03bcg about 0.8 \u03bcg, about 1 \u03bcg, about 2 \u03bcg, about 3 \u03bcg, about 4 \u03bcg, about 5 \u03bcg, about 6 \u03bcg, about 7 \u03bcg, about 9 \u03bcg, about 10 \u03bcg, about 15 \u03bcg, about 20 \u03bcg, about 25 \u03bcg, about 30 \u03bcg, about 35 \u03bcg, 40 \u03bcg, about 45 \u03bcg, about 50 \u03bcg, about 60 \u03bcg, about 70 \u03bcg, about 80 \u03bcg, about 90 \u03bcg, about 100 \u03bcg, about 110 \u03bcg, about 120 \u03bcg, about 130 \u03bcg, about 140 \u03bcg, about 150 \u03bcg or higher of VLPs and the antigen formulated similarly to the inactivated vaccines currently licensed for marketing is administered to a vertebrate (i.e. equivalent amounts of HA and/or NA in a VLP with equivalent amounts of HA and/or NA formulated in similarly to the licensed inactivated vaccines and/or any other antigen) Amounts can be measured according to HA content. For example, 1 \u03bcg of a VLP of the invention is about 1 \u03bcg of HA in a solution of VLPs comprising HA or may be measured by weight of VLPs.</p>Seasonal influenza vaccines are administered to humans every year to reduce the incidence of influenza cases every year. At present, there are two subtypes of influenza A and influenza B circulating in the United States. Current vaccines are, therefore, trivalent to provide protection against the strains currently circ",
    "or neutralizing antibodies directed against mucosal pathogens preventing pathogen entry and can function intracellularly to inhibit replication of virus. Nasal secretions contain neutralizing antibodies particularly to influenza HA and NA, which are primarily of the IgA isotype and are produced locally. During primary infection, all three major Ig classes (IgG, IgA and IgM) specific to HA can be detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in nasal washings, although IgA and IgM are more frequently detected than IgG. Both IgA and, to some extent, IgM are actively secreted locally, whereas IgG is derived as a serum secretion. In subjects who have a local IgA response, a serum IgA response also is observed. The local IgA response stimulated by natural infection lasts for at least 3-5 months, and influenza-specific, IgA-committed memory cells can be detected locally. IgA also is the predominant Ig isotype in local secretions after secondary infection, and an IgA response is detected in the serum upon subsequent infection. The presence of locally produced neutralizing antibodies induced by live virus vaccine correlates with resistance to infection and illness after challenge with wild-type virus.</p>Resistance to influenza infection or illness is correlated with the level of local and/or serum antibody to HA and NA. Serum anti-HA antibodies are the most commonly measured correlate of protection against influenza (Cox et al., 1999). A protective serum antibody (haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer\u226740) response can be detected in approximately 80% of subjects after natural influenza infection. B cells producing all three major Ig classes are present in the peripheral blood in normal subjects (Cox et al., 1994) and individuals undergoing influenza infection. In humans, serum antibodies play a role in both resistance to and recovery from influenza infection. The level of serum antibody to HA and NA in humans can be correlated with resistance to illness following experimental infection and natural infection. During primary infection, the three major Ig classes can be detected within 10-14 days. IgA and IgM levels peak after 2 weeks and then begin to decline, whereas the level of IgG peaks at 4-6 weeks. Whereas IgG and IgM are dominant in the primary response, IgG and IgA predominate in the secondary immune response.</p>Thus, the invention encompasses a method of inducing a substantially protective antibody response to influenza virus infection or at least one symptom thereof in a subject, comprising administering at least one effective dose of an influenza VLP. In another embodiment, said induction of substantially protective antibody response reduces duration of influenza symptoms. In another embodiment, a method to induce substantially protective antibody response to influenza virus infection or at least one symptom thereof in a subject, comprises administering at least one effective dose of an influenza VLP, wherein said VLP comprises influenza HA,",
    "ence of the NA gene with the adjacent 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-regions within the pNA plasmid was determined (SEQ ID NO:1) (FIG. 1). At the same time, the nucleotide sequences of the HA and M1 genes with the adjacent regions were also determined using the pHAM plasmid (SEQ ID NOS:2 and 3) (FIGS. 2 and 3).</p>Finally, a restriction DNA fragment from the pHAM plasmid that encoded both the HA and M1 expression cassettes was cloned into the pNA plasmid. This resulted in the plasmid pNAHAM encoding avian influenza A/Hong Kong/1073/99 (H9N2) virus HA, NA, and M1 genes (FIG. 4).</p>Plasmid pNAHAM was used to construct a recombinant baculovirus containing influenza virus NA, HA, and M1 genes integrated into the genome, each downstream from a separate baculovirus polyhedrin promoter. Infection of permissive Sf-9S insect cells with the resulting recombinant baculovirus resulted in co-expression of these three influenza genes in each Sf-9S cell infected with such recombinant baculovirus.</p>The expression products in infected Sf-9S cells were characterized at 72 hr postinfection (p.i. by SDS-PAGE analysis, Coomassie blue protein staining, and Western immunoblot analysis using HA- and M1-specific antibodies (FIG. 5). Western immunoblot analysis was carried out using rabbit antibody raised against influenza virus type A/Hong Kong/1073/99 (H9N2) (CDC, Atlanta, Ga., USA), or mouse monoclonal antibody to influenza M1 protein (Serotec, UK). The HA, NA, and M1 proteins of the expected molecular weights (64 kd, 60 kd, and 31 kd, respectively) were detected by Western immunoblot analysis. Compared to the amount of HA protein detected in this assay, the NA protein showed lower reactivity with rabbit serum to influenza A/Hong Kong/1073/99 (H9N2) virus. Explanations for the amount of detectable NA protein included lower expression levels of the NA protein from Sf-9S cells infected with recombinant baculovirus as compared to the HA protein, lower reactivity of the NA with this serum under denaturing conditions in the Western immunoblot assay (due to the elimination of important NA epitopes during gel electrophoresis of membrane binding), lower NA-antibody avidity as compared to HA-antibody, or a lower abundance of NA-antibodies in the serum.</p>The culture medium from the Sf-9S cells infected with recombinant baculovirus expressing A/Hong Kong/1073/99 (H9N2) HA, NA, and M1 proteins was also probed for influenza proteins. The clarified culture supernatants were subjected to ultracentrifugation at 27,000 rpm in order to concentrate high-molecular protein complexes of influenza virus, such as subviral particles, VLP, complexes of VLP, and possibly, other self-assembled particulates comprised of influenza HA, NA, and M1 proteins. Pelleted protein products were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) and further purified by ultracentrifugation on discontinuous 20-60% sucrose step gradients. Fractions from the sucrose gradients were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE analysis, Western immunob",
    "oresis under reduced conditions (10 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol) on 4-12% polyacrylamide gradient NuPAGE gels (InVitrogen) in MES buffer at 172 volts until the bromophenol blue tracking dye disappeared. For protein gels, the electrophoreses proteins were visualized by staining with Colloidal Coomassie Blue reagent (InVitrogen). Proteins were transferred from the gel to nitrocellulose membranes in methanol by the standard Western blot procedure. Sera from VLP-immunized mice and rabbits immunized with inactivated avian influenza virus H9N2 (positive control sera) were diluted 1:25 and 1:100, respectively, in PBS solution (pH 7.2) and used as primary antibody. Protein bound membranes, which were blocked with 5% casein, were reacted with primary antisera for 60 minutes at room temperature with constant shaking. Following washing of primary antibody membranes with phosphate buffered saline solution containing Tween 20, secondary antisera [goat anti-murine IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (1:10,000) or goat anti-rabbit IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (1:10,000)] were reacted 60 minutes with the membrane. Following washing of secondary antibody membranes with phosphate buffered saline solution containing Tween 20, antibody-binding proteins on the membranes were visualized by development with the chromogenic substrate such as NBT/BCIP (InVitrogen).</p>The results of Western blot analysis (FIG. 12) were that proteins with molecular weights similar to viral HA and M1 proteins (75 and 30 kd, respectively) bound to positive control sera (FIG. 12B) and sera from mice immunized with the recombinant influenza H9N2 VLPs (FIG. 12A). These results indicated that the recombinant influenza H9N2 VLPs alone were immunogenic in mice by this route of administration.</p>Example 15Kong/1073/99 (H9N2) VLP Immunogenicity And Challenge Study In BALB/c MiceBALB/C mice were immunized with H9N2 VLPs (1 \u03bcg HA or 10 \u03bcg HA/dose), with or without 100 \u03bcg Novasome adjuvant, on day 0 and day 21 and challenged with homologous infectious virus IN on day 57. Mice were bled on days 0, 27 and 57 with the serum assayed for anti-HA antibodies by the hemagglutination inhibition assay (HI) using turkey RBCs, and influenza by ELISA. Results of this study are shown in FIG. 13 through FIG. 16.</p>High titers of H9N2 antibodies were induced after a single immunization (primary) with H9N2 VLP vaccine without or with Novasomes and a dose of 10 \u03bcg VLPs containing 1 \u03bcg HA (FIG. 13). Specific antibody titers were increased about half to one log following a booster immunization.</p>After immunization and a boost with 1 \u03bcg of HA in the form of H9N2 VLPs the serum HI levels were at or above the level generally considered protective (log 2=5) in all animals (FIG. 14, lower left panel). H9N2 VLPs formulated with Novasome adjuvant increased HI responses about 2 fold following primary immunization and about 4 fold after the booster (FIG. 14, lower right panel). Purified subunit H9N2 hemagglutinin also induced protective levels of HI antibodies after boosting and Novasomes again increased HI antibody responses by about 2 fold after the primary and 4 fold after the booster immunizations (FIG. 14, upper panels). The level of HI antibody induced with 10 \u03bcg of HA given as a subunit vaccine was equivalent to 1 \u03bcg of HA presented in the form of a VLP.</p>In addition, weight loss was significantly less in the mice immunized with H9N2 VLPs or with VLPs plus adjuvant compared to unvaccinated control animals (FIG. 15). There was no statistical difference in weight loss in the groups immunized with H9N2 VLPs and H9N2 VLPs plus Novasome adjuvant.</p>Likewise, lung virus titers at 3 and 5 days post challenge with H9N2 virus were significantly reduced in mice immunized with H9N2 VLPs (FIG. 16). At day 3 when the influenza virus titers peak in the lung tissues, mice immunized with H9N2 VLPs plus Novasomes\u00ae had a significantly greater reduction in virus titer compared to mice immunized with VLPs alone and the unvaccinated control mice.</p>Example 16A/Fujian/411/2002 (H3N2) VLP Immunogenicity and Cross Reactivity Between Several influenza StrainsBALB/c mice were immunized with A/Fujian/411/2002 VLPs (3.0, 0.6, 0.12 and 0.24 \u03bcg HA/dose), twice IM and IN. Mice were bled on days 0 and 35. The serum was then assayed for anti-HA antibodies by the hemagglutination inhibition assay (HI) using turkey RBCs, and for anti-influenza antibodies by ELISA. Results of this study are shown on FIGS. 17A, 17B and 17C. These results indicate that an immune response was mounted both IM and IN against HA and NA.</p>Example 17Determination of the IgG Isotypes in Mouse after Inoculation with H3N2 VLPsMice were inoculated with VLPs intramuscularly and intranasal. At week 5 sera was collected and assayed to distinguish between IgG isotypes.</p>Sera was tested on plates coated with purified HA (Protein Sciences) A/Wyoming/3/2003 using an ELISA assay. Serial five-fold dilutions of sera was added to the wells and the plates were incubated. Next, the biotinylated goat anti-mouse Ig, or anti-mouse IgG1, anti-mouse IgG2a, anti-mouse IgG2b and anti-mouse IgG3. Then, streptavidine-peroxidase was added to the wells. Bound conjugates were detected. Results are illustrated on FIGS. 18A and B. These results illustrate that IgG2a are the most abundant isotype in an immune response against VLPs in mouse.</p>Example 18A/Hong Kong/1073/99 (H9N2) VLP Dose-Ranging Study in SD RatsSD rats (n=6 per dose) were immunized on day 0 and day 21 with purified A/Hong Kong/1073/99 (H9N2) VLPs diluted with PBS at neutral pH to 0.12, 0.6, 3.0, and 15.0 \u03bcg HA or with PBS alone. Blood samples were taken from the animals on day 0, day 21, day 35 and day 49 and the serum assayed for hemagglutination inhibition assay (HI) to detect functional antibodies able to inhibit the binding function of the HA. The dosage was based on HA content as measured using SDS-PAGE and scanning densitometry of purified H9N2 VLPs. Hemagglutinin inhibition assay titer results are depicted in FIG. 19. A single 0.6 \u03bcg HA dose of H9N2 VLPs or two doses of 0.12 \u03bcg HA produced protective levels of HI antibodies in rats. These data indicate that a lower amount of HA can induce a protective response when said HA is part of a VLP.</p>Example 19Kong/1073/99 (H9N2) VLP ImmunogenicityBALB/C mice were immunized with H9N2 VLPs (0.12, 0.6 \u03bcg HA/dose), with or without 100 \u03bcg Novasome and Alum adjuvant, on day 0 and day 21 and challenged with homologous infectious virus IN on day 57. Mice were also immunized with 3.0 and 15.0 \u03bcg HA/dose (no adjuvant). Mice were bled on days 0, 21, 35 and 49 with the serum assayed for anti-HA antibodies by the hemagglutination inhibition assay (HI) using turkey RBCs, and influenza by ELISA. Results of this study are shown in FIGS. 20 A and B.</p>The results indicate that a more robust overall immune response was observed when the VLPs were administered with an adjuvant. However, a protective response was elicited with 0.12 \u03bcg HA/dose at week 3 when compared to the VLPs formulation with Alum and VLPs with no adjuvant. Also in week 7, the VLPs comprising Novasomes had about 2 log increase in HI titer as compared to the VLP with Alum. The robustness of the response was similar to VLPs administered at 3.0 and 15.0 \u03bcg HA/dose without an adjuvant. These results indicate that Novasomes elicit a more robust response as compared to Alum. In addition, a protective immune response can be achieved with 25\u00d7 less VLPs when said VLPs are administered in a formulation comprising Novasomes.</p>Also, in the 0.6 \u03bcg HA/dose data, the Novasome formulation had an about 1.5 log greater response than compared to Alum. The immune responses were similar in magnitude to VLPs administered in 3.0 and 15.0 \u03bcg HA/dose without adjuvant. These results indicate that with an adjuvant, approximately 5\u00d7 less VLPs are needed to be administered to achieve a protective response.</p>Also, FIG. 20B depicts the HI titer of H9N2 VLPs using different formulations of Novasomes. The following are the formulas used in the experiment:</p>H9N2 VLP (0.1 \u03bcg) (n=5)\u2003\u2003Group 1\n</p>H9N2 VLP (0.1 \u03bcg) w/ DCW neat) (n=5)\u2003\u2003Group 2\n</p>H9N2 VLP (0.1 \u03bcg) w/ DC",

All ferrets purchased has an HAI titer of less that 10 hemagglutination units. Approximately two days prior to vaccination, animals were implanted with a temperature transponder (BioMedic Data Systems, Inc.). Animal (6 animals/group) were vaccinated on day 0 either with (1) PBS (negative control, group one), (2) H3N2 influenza VLPs @ 15 \u03bcg of H3 (group 2), (3) H3N2 influenza VLPs @ 3 \u03bcg of H3 (group 2), (4) H3N2 influenza VLPs @ 0.6 \u03bcg of H3 (group 3), (5) H3N2 influenza VLPs @ 0.12 \u03bcg of H3 (group 5), or (6) rH3HA @ 15 \u03bcg (group 6). On day 21 animals were boosted with vaccine. Animals were bled on days 0 (prior to vaccination), day 21 (prior to vaccine boost), and day 42. Animals were assessed for clinical signs of adverse vaccine effects once weekly throughout the study period. Similar studies were performed with other influenza VLPs.</p>HAI Levels in Ferret SeraFerret sera were obtained from FFF, treated with Receptor Destroying Enzyme (RDE) and tested in a hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay by standard procedures (Kendal et al. (1982)). All ferrets that were chosen for the study tested negative (HAI\u226610) for pre-existing antibodies to currently circulating human influenza virus (A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1), A panama/2007/99 (H3N2), A/Wellington/01/04 (H2N3) and B/Sichuan/379/99 and H5N1).</p>FerretsApproximately 8 month-old, influenza na\u00efve, castrated and descented, male Fitch ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) were purchased form FFF Animals were housed in stainless steel rabbit cages (Shor-line, KS) containing Sani-chips Laboratory Animal Bedding (P. J. Murphy Forest Products, NJ). Ferrets were provided with Teklad Global Ferret Diet (Harlan Teklad, Wis.) and fresh water ad libitum. Pans were changed three times each week, and cages were cleaned biweekly.</p>Vaccinations and Blood Collection of FerretsThe vaccine, H3N2 influenza VLPs or H9N2 influenza VLPs and controls, for example, rH3NA (A/Wyoming/3/2003) and PBS (negative control) were stored at 4\u00b0 C. prior to use. For most studies, six groups of ferrets (N-6/group) were vaccinated intramuscularly with either concentration of vaccine or control in a volume of 0.5 ml.</p>Prior to blood collection and vaccination, animals were anesthetized by intramuscular injection into the inner thigh with a solution of Katamine (25 mg/kg, Atropine (0.05 mg/kg) and Xylazine (2.0 mg/kg) \u201cKAX.\u201d Once under anesthesia, ferrets were positioned in dorsal recumbency and blood was collected (volume between 0.5 a",

Avian influenza viruses bind to sialic acid receptors containing N-acetylneuraminic acid \u03b1 2,3 galactose (\u03b1 2,3 linkages) and express both \u03b1 2,3 and \u03b1 2,6 linkages. Turkey erythocytes (TRBC) are used for the HAI assay since A/Fujian is a human influenza virus. The TRBCs adjusted with PBS to achieve a 0.5% vol/vol suspension. The cells are kept at 4\u00b0 C. and used within 72 hours of preparation.</p>HAI AssayThe HAI assay was adapted from the CDC laboratory-based influenza surveillance manual (Kendal et al. (1982) Concepts and procedures for laboratory based influenza surveillance, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, Ga., herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes). RDE-Tx sera was serially two-fold diluted in v-bottom microtiter plates. An equal volume of virus adjusted, adjusted to approximately 8 HAU/50 ul was added to each well. The plates were covered and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes followed by the addition of 0.5% TRBC. The plates were mixed by agitation, covered, and the TRBC were allowed to settle for 30 minutes at room temperature. The HAI titer was determined by the reciprocal dilution of the last row which contained non-agglutinated TRBC. Positive and negative serum controls were included for each plate.</p>Example 21A/Hong Kong/1073/99 (H9N2) VLP Dose-Ranging Study in FerretsFerrets, serologically negative by hemagglutination inhibition for influenza viruses, were used to assess the antibody and HI titer after an inoculation with H9N2 VLPs. Ferrets were bled on days 0, and 21 days with the serum assayed for anti-HA antibodies by the hemagglutination inhibition assay (HI) using turkey RBCs, and for anti-influenza antibodies by ELISA. Results are illustrated in FIG. 22. These results show HI titers corresponding to protective antibody levels at VLP doses of 1.5 and 15 \u03bcg.</p>Example 21Vaccination of H3N2 VLPs in FerretsFerrets were vaccinated at day 0, and given a boost on day 21 with different strains of H3N2 VLPs at different dosages (HA dosages of 0.12, 0.6, 3.0, 15.0 \u03bcg). The positive control was rH3HA at 15 \u03bcg and PBS alone is the negative control. Sera, as described above, were taken from the ferrets on day 0 prior to vaccination, day 21 (prior to boost) and day 42. An HI assay was conducted on the serum samples to determine if there was an immune response against the VLPs. These data are illustration on FIG. 23. These data indicate that H3N2 VLPs, when introduced into ferrets, do induce an immune response. Thus, the H3N2 VLPs are immunogenic in ferrets.</p>Example 22RT-PCR and Cloning of HA, NA, and M1 Genes of Influenza A/Indonesia/5/05 (H5N1) VirusClade 2 influenza virus, strain A/Indonesia/5/05 (H5N1) viral RNA was extracted using Trizol LS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) under BSL-3 containment conditions. Reverse transcription (RT) and PCR were performed on extracted viral RNA using the One-Step RT-PCR system (Invitrogen) with gene-specific oligonucleotide primers. The following primer pairs were used for the synthesis of the H5N1 hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and matrix (M1) genes, respectively:</p>(S",

The mice were given a boost on day 21. The serum was assayed for anti-HA antibodies by the hemagglutination inhibition assay (HI) using turkey RBCs and influenza virus using an ELISA. Results of this study are shown in FIGS. 24 and 25.</p>The results indicate that a robust overall immune response was observed when the VLPs were administered intramuscularly at very lose doses. The robustness of the response was similar to control at 3.0 and 0.6 \u03bcg HA/dose. These data show see a true dose response and the antibody response to 0.2 \u03bcg of VLP is greater than 3.0 \u03bcg of rHA protein. Although the response was not as robust for the intranasal administration, a dose of VLPs at 0.2 \u03bcg HA/dose did induce a robust response. The ELISA titer with the 0.2 \u03bcg dose in this experiment is similar to the 0.12 \u03bcg dose of the H3N2 VLP vaccine in previous experiments, see above.</p>Example 27Challenge StudiesThe results indic After inoculating BALB/c mice with VLPs at concentrations of 3 \u03bcg, 0.6 \u03bcg 0.12 \u03bcg and 0.02 \u03bcg of H3N2 VLPs intramuscularly and intranasally (total HA dose), mice were challenged with influenza virus A/Aichi/268x31. The results of this study are shown on FIGS. 27 and 28. These data show that there is a decrease in weight in all vaccinated animals, however the animals that were vaccinated with 3.0 \u03bcg and 0.12 \u03bcg of VLPs recovered quicker than the other animals in both intramuscular and intranasal vaccinations. The intranasal doses provided enhanced protection.</p>Example 29Challenge Studies (Ferrets)In this study, ferrets were vaccinated with H9N2 VLPs. There were a total of 18 ferrets",
    ", ferrets were challenged with 10<sup>6 </sup>EID<sub>50 </sub>of A/HK/1073/99 intranasally. Nasal washes were collected on days 1, 3, 5 and 7. The virus in the nasal washes was titered on days 3, 5 and 7 for all animals. These data are represented on Table 2 and in FIG. 29. These data show that by day 7, all of the vaccinated animals had no detectable virus in nasal washes while the mock group had detectable viral titers.</p>TABLE 2Wild Type Virus Titers (log 10/ml) in Ferrets after viral challengeFerretDay 3Day 5Day 7Group: Placebo Mock Control (n = 6)451275.53.545246.56.751.9845257.56.56.7545267.57.253.545276.757.252.545287.56.252.75Mean7.1256.5833333.496667Std.0.440170.664581.699137Dev.Group: Low Dose39166.752.751.539177.55.51.539187.56.51.539195.531.539206.752.251.539216.53.51.5Avg6.753.9166671.5Std Dev0.741621.6931230Group: High Dose39226.52.751.539236.253.751.539245.751.51.539256.54.751.539266.253.51.539275.751.51.5Avg.6.1666672.9583331.5Std Dev0.3415651.2982360</p>Example 30Mice Intramuscular and Intranasal Inoculation StudiesMice were inoculated with A/Fujian/411/2002 (H3N2) VLPs at concentrations of 3 \u03bcg, 0.6 \u03bcg 0.12 \u03bcg or 0.024 \u03bcg (total HA dose) intramuscularly or intranasally at day 0 and were boosted 3 weeks later. Control mice were inoculated with formalin inactivated A/Wyoming (Fujian-Like, vaccine strain) or PBS. Sera were collected from the inoculated mice at weeks 0, 3, 5 and 8. The collected sera were assayed for anti-HA antibodies by the hemagglutination inhibition assay (HI) for anti-influenza antibodies by ELISA. The assay was conducted using A/Fujian/411/2002, A/Panama/2007/99, A/Wyoming/3/03 and A/New York/55/2004 influenza virus strains of H3N2. Results of this study are shown on FIGS. 30 A-H. These data indicate the H3N2 VLPs induced antibodies against the parent A/Fujian/411/2002 strains of influenza virus and against other H3N2 strains. These data also indicate that the titers in intranasally inoculated mice rise later than intramuscularly inoculated mice. However, the intranasal titers are higher than intramuscular titers after about 8 weeks. In addition, titers to the inactivated virus antigen appear to be comparable to the VLP at equivalent doses following intramuscular inoculation. However, the inactivated antigen does not appear to be as immunogenic following intranasal inoculation, nor is it as broadly protective following intranasal inoculation.</p>Example 31 Generation of Clade 2 H5N1 Influenza HA, NA, and M1 Genes Optimized for Efficient Expression in Sf9 CellsThe following optimized nucleotides and polypeptides corresponding to HA, NA and M1 of Clade 2 H5N1 viruses, A A/Indonesia/5/05, A/Bar headed goose/Qinghai/1A/2005 and A/Anhui/1/2005, were designed and synthesized (Geneart GMBH, Regensburg, FRG) as disclosed above.

Dosing commenced at 15 \u03bcg, which is approximately one third of the total HA antigen content targeted for most seasonal influenza vaccines. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either two doses (day 0 and day 28) of vaccine or placebo in a 7:3 ratio.</p>The H5N1 VLP vaccine (H5N1 VLP) used in this study was comprised of virus-like particles (VLPs) containing the hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and matrix 1 (M1) proteins derived from A/Indonesia/05/2005 (H5N1) influenza virus, which had been extracted and purified from Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus containing the influenza virus genes for HA, NA, and M1. The 45 mg dosages were packaged in single-dose vials, with 0.5 mL dose of the vaccine formulated to contain 45 \u03bcg of HA in phosphate buffered saline with 0.5M NaCl at neutral pH. The 15 \u03bcg dose was prepared by the clinical site pharmacist by 5:1 dilution of placebo (phosphate buffered saline with 0.5M NaCl at neutral pH) and 180 \u03bcg/ml vaccine according to a standard procedure. The H5N1 VLP vaccine was administered by IM injection in the deltoid muscle.</p>Blood samples for the evaluation were collected at baseline (pre dose 1), approximately 4 weeks later (post dose 1/pre dose 2), approximately 4 weeks post dose 2 and approximately 6 months post dose two. Hemagglutination-inhibition titers and viral neutralization titers were measured utilizing the assays described above. The viruses used for the neutralization studies were wild type, egg-adapted, A/Indo/5/2005 and A/Vietnam/1203/04.
