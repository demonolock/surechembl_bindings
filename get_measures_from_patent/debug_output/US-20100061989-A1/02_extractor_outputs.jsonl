The text primarily discusses experimental methods, results, and biological processes without providing specific bioactivity metrics with numeric values and units."}
{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that meet the specified criteria. The text does not contain specific molecule names, bioactivity metrics (IC50, Ki, Kd, EC50), numeric values, and units in the same sentence. The text appears to be focused on describing protein interactions, cellular localization, and epigenetic modifications, but does not provide quantitative data on bioactivity metrics."}
