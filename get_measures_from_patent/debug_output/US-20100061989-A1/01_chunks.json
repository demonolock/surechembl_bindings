The expression of such genes is subjected to gene silencing after birth mediated by repressive histone modifications and DNA methyltransferase, PRMT-5, mediates symmetric di-methylation of arginine 3(R3) on histone H4 (H4R3me2s) and inhibition of expression of fetal \u03b3-gl",
    "-f displayed the specific repressive epigenetic mark H4R3me2s at the \u03b3-promoters, CUP analysis was performed (FIG. 1E). As the antibody utilized for this assay (ab5823, Abcam, Cambridge, U.K.) recognizes symmetric methylation of R3 on both histone H4 and H2A (Ancelin et al, Nat. Cell. Biol. 8:623, 2006), ChIP/ReChIP was performed with a pan H4 antibody followed by ab5823 to specifically quantitated H4R3me2s at the \u03b3-promoters. Although the levels of H4 were identical in the two cell lines, a substantial increase in H4R3me2s in cells expressing wild-type PRMT-5 compared to the mutant was observed.</p>Although K562 cells are used as a model of feal erythropoiesis as they express the \u03b3- but not the \u03b2-globin genes, only a relatively small percentage of cells (10%) express globin chains when grown in the absence of the chemical inducer, hemin. To determine the effects of perturbed expression of PRMT-5 on \u03b3-gene expression, Northern analyses on PRMT-5-f and PRMT-5\u0394-f expressing K562 cells was performed (FIG. 2A, top panels). Expression of both proteins was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antisera (FIG. 2A, bottom panel). Enforced expression of PRMT-5-f induced almost complete silencing of \u03b3-gene expression. In contrast, expression of PRMT-5\u0394-f led to a four-fold induction of \u03b3-gene expression compared to the vector control. To confirm this finding, PRMT-5 expression in K562 cells was knock down using two different stably expressed short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (PRMT-5-kd). Cells transfected with an expression vector containing a scrambled sequence served as the control (scr). Western blotting confirmed that PRMT-5 protein levels were reduced by more than 90% in the PRMT-5-kd cells compared with the scrambled control, but not effect was observed on the control proteins, tubulin or GATA-1 (FIG. 2B, lower panels). The knock down of PRMT-5 led to a four-fold induction of \u03b3-gene expression compared to the scrambled siRNA vector (FIG. 2B, upper panels).</p>To determine whether additional histone modifications were induced in response to increased PRMT-5 expression, chip analyses was performed on the PRMT-5-f and PRMT-5-kd K562 lines using a range of specific antibodies (FIG. 2C). Consistent with the \u03b3-gene expression data, the H4R3me2s repressive mark was readily detected at the \u03b3-promoters in the PRMT-5-f cells, but was completely absent at the promoters in the PRMT-5-kd cells. Two other histone H4 modifications that have been linked to gene silencing, phosphorylation of H4S1 (H4S1ph) [Utley et al, Mol. Cell. Biol. 25:8179, 2005] were also differentially localized to the \u03b3-promoters in the two lines, with high levels observed in the PRMT-5-f lines, and absence of the marks in the knock down lines. Tri-methylation of H3K9 (H3K9me3), which has previously been shown to be required for the H4K20me3 repressive mark (Schotta et al, Genes Dev. 18:1251, 2004), and tri-methylation of H3K27 (H3K27me3), which has been linked to DNA methylation (Fuks, supra 2005), were also increased in the PRMT-5-f lines. These changes were reflected in the localization of RNA polymerase II (RNA pollII) to the promoter, which was markedly reduced in the PRMT-5-f cells compared to the knock down cells. Assessment of histone H4 acetylation in the different cell lines revealed a reduction in H4K12ac in the PRMT-5-f cells, but no alterations at lysines 5, 8 or 16. No changes in any of the histone marks were observed at either the MyoD or GATA-1 promoters.</p>Whether the presence of these repressive histone markers were dependent on the methyltransferase activity of PRMT-5 was examined by performing ChIP analyses on the K562 cells expressing PRMT-5\u0394-f compared with PRMT-5-f. Binding of the mutant PRMT-5 to the \u03b3-promoters in these cells, was demonstrated which was accompanied by loss of H4R3me2s. Concomitantly, complete loss of H4S1ph was observed, and a marked reduction ",
    " partners (FIG. 3A). Associates between PRMT-5 and the MBD2/NuRD complex proteins Mi2, mSin3A, MBD2 and HDAC1 were demonstrated. MBD3 was also identified as a PRMT-5 interacting protein this setting. In contrast, Brg-1 was not associated with PRMT-5. The DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3a was demonstrated to be associated with PRMT-5. Casein kinase II\u03b1 (CKII\u03b1) and Suv4-20h1/2, the enzymes linked to the repressive markers H4S1ph and H4K20me3s identified in ChIP analysis were also found to co-immunoprecipitate with PRMT-5 (Utley et al, supra 2005; Schotta et al, supra 2004). The localization of these complex components on the \u03b3-promoters was confirmed by ChIP in K562 cells expressing PRMT-5-f (FIG. 3B).</p>In view of the reduction in H4S1ph and H4K20me3s in cells expressing PRMT-5\u0394-f, the possibility of whether assembly of the repressor complex on the \u03b3-promoters was also dependent on the methyltransferase activity of PRMT-5 was examined. ChIP assays were performed on PRMT-5\u0394-f expressing cells using antisera to selected complex components (FIG. 3C). The results indicated that the methyltransferase activity of PRMT-5 was essential for assembly of the repressor complex, and the subsequent repressive histone marks that emanated from this.</p>The presence of Dnmt3a in the PRMT-5-dependent complex raised the possibility that repression of \u03b3-gene expression by this complex may also involve DNA methylation. To determine this, the methylation status of the promoters in the PRMT-5-f, PRMT-5-kd, and PRMT-5\u0394-f stable cell lines were examined using bisulfite DNA sequencing, with the line stably transfected with the scrambled siRNA construct serving as the control (FIG. 3D). Consistent with the observation that globin chain expression is not detectable in a large proportion of uninduced K562 cells, methylation of the four CpG dinucleotides immediately flanking the transcriptional start site in 15-23% of clones derived from the scrambled construct transfection was observed. This frequency was increased in three of the four sites in the PRMT-5-f lines, with 38% of the clones showing methylation. In contrast, methylation of all the CpG dinucleotides was abolished in clones derived from the PRMT-5-kd cells, suggesting that PRMT-5 is essential for the epigenetic modification of DNA in this setting. Complete loss of methylation was also observed in the PRMT-5\u0394-f cells in keeping with data showing loss of both complex assembly and additional repressive modifications in the absence of PRMT-5 enzymatic activity.</p>To determine whether the repressive histone mark induced by PRMT-5 was evident at the human \u03b3-globin promoters in a developmentally specific pattern, primary erythroid progenitors were isolated from cord blood (CB) and adult bone marrow (BM). Expression of the \u03b3-globin genes was markedly higher in CB compared to BM by quantitative RT-PCR (FIG. 4A). ChIP/ReChIP analysis using the pan H4 antisera followed by ab5823 demonstrated an increase in H4R3me2s at the \u03b3-promoters in adult BM erthroid progeinotrs compared with progenitors derived from CB (FIG. 4B). This was accompanied by a reduction in RNA polII localized to the \u03b3-promoters. PRMT-5 has been shown previously to translocate from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in mouse germ cells at the time of extensive epigenetic reprogramming of mouse germ cells (Ancelin et al, supra 2006). The cellular localization of PRMT-5 was examined by immunofluorescence in the CB and BM erythroid progenitors and demonstrated that the protein was predominantly nuclear in the BM, whereas it was primarily localized in the cytoplasm in the CB progenitors (FIG. 4C). These findings indicate a mechanism by which PRMT-5 may play a specific deve"
