    "gation reactions are initiated by the addition of ATP, and proceed for 60 min at 25\u00b0 C. Reactions are quenched by the addition of 0.2 M EDTA, and product formation is collected by filtration through Multiscreen plates (Millipore). Quantification of product formation was performed using TopCount (Perkin Elmer). The inhibitor concentration at which the enzyme catalysed rate is reduced by half (IC<sub>50</sub>) is determined using a computer program for curve fitting. IC<sub>50 </sub>concentrations for nucleoside 5\u2032-triphosphate compounds of the present disclosure are expected to range from &lt;10 nM to &gt;100 \u03bcM. Under these conditions, the IC<sub>50 </sub>for Compound 25 is 0.37 \u03bcM.</p>HCV NS5b Polymerase K<sub>i </sub>Determination Assay</p>A modified method of the NS5b Polymerase inhibition assay was used to determine the K<sub>i </sub>and the mode of action for NS5b inhibitor compounds. The enzyme and template were fixed at 100 nM and 20 g/mL and all other reaction conditions were identical to the NS5b polymerase inhibition assay. The velocity of NS5b reactions were monitored at different ATP and inhibitor concentrations. The ATP concentration ranged from 0.1 \u03bcM to 1000 \u03bcM, and the concentration of the inhibitor ranged from 0.003 fold to 7 fold of the IC<sub>50 </sub>value. Velocities obtained at each ATP and inhibitor concentration were analyzed using Graph Pad Prism to identify the mode of inhibition and K<sub>i </sub>for inhibitor compounds. Under these conditions, the Ki for Compound 25 is 0.08 \u03bcM.</p>Example 27In vitro anabolism of Compound 9 in replicon cells and primary human hepatocytes produces the triphosphate species Compound 25.

The Huh-7 human hepatoma liver cells (JCRB0403 http://cellbank.nibio.gojp/) are maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Huh-7 cell clones carrying a HCV subgenomic replicon (Lohmann et al., 1999. Science 285: 110-113) are maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.25 mg/ml G418. The cell lines are grown at 37\u00b0 C. in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub>-95% air atmosphere. Plated primary human hepatocytes (6-well Collagen/No Overlay) were purchased from Cellz Direct (NC, USA) and maintained in InVitroGro Medium (Celsius, In Vitro Technologies, MD USA) under the same incubation conditions.</p>For intracellular anabolism studies, Huh-7 cells are trypsinized, harvested, re-suspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, counted and seeded at a density of 0.7\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>cells per well in a six-well plate and incubated for a period of"
