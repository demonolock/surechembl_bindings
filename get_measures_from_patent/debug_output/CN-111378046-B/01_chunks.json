    "g the novel chimeric antigen receptor shows better in-vivo proliferation and persistence in liquid tumor and solid tumor, and also has better anti-tumor effect. </p><p id=\"p0008\" num=\"0006\">EGFR (abbreviated as EGFR, erbB-1 or HER 1) is one of the members of the epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family. This family includes HER1 (erbB 1, EGFR), HER2 (erbB 2, NEU), HER3 (erbB 3), and HER4 (erbB 4). The HER family plays an important regulatory role in cellular physiology. EGFR is widely distributed on the surfaces of mammalian epithelial cells, fibroblasts, glial cells, keratinocytes and the like, and EGFR signaling pathways play an important role in physiological processes such as growth, proliferation, differentiation and the like of cells. Studies have shown that there is high or abnormal expression of EGFR in many solid tumors. EGFR is involved in the inhibition of proliferation, angiogenesis, tumor invasion, metastasis and apoptosis of tumor cells. The over-expression of EGFR plays an important role in the evolution of malignant tumors, and the over-expression of EGFR is found in tissues such as glioblastoma, renal carcinoma, lung carcinoma, prostate carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, breast carcinoma and the like, so EGFR is a potential tumor treatment target. There are a number of drugs currently targeting EGFR. There are small molecule inhibitors of the amino acid kinase (TKI) acting on the intracellular region of the receptor, such as gefitinib, erlotinib, EKB-549, PKI-166, GW-2016 and CI-1033. Monoclonal antibodies (mabs) acting on the extracellular region of the receptor, such as cetuximab, ABX-EGF, and EMD 72000. As well as some other immune-directed therapies, gene therapy, etc. </p><p id=\"p0009\" num=\"0007\">Therefore, ACT therapy using TIL and CAR-T cells has a superior effect at present, but in clinical practice, CAR-T cells and TIL cells are difficult to expand in large amounts in vitro and effectively proliferate and persist in vivo, so that the therapeutic effect of ACT is affected to some extent. There is thus a need for a method that can effectively expand immune effector cells in vitro and/or in vivo.</p></background-art><disclosure><p id=\"p0010\">Disclosure of Invention</p><p id=\"p0011\" num=\"0008\">The invention aims to solve the technical problems of short proliferation and duration time, poor effect and unsatisfactory killing effect on target cells of immune effector cells such as T cells or TILs in vivo, which are conventional in the prior art, and provides an immune effector cell conversion receptor. The immune effector cell receptor of the invention comprises an extracellular antigen domain, a hinge region, a transmembrane region, an intracellular co-stimulatory region, an interleukin receptor chain comprising a JAK binding motif and a STAT5 binding motif, and an intracellular signaling region comprising a STAT3 activating motif. The immune effector cell receptor provided by the invention activates downstream intracellula",

The integration vector may integrate the exogenous nucleic acid at a site in the host cell genome or randomly. </p><p id=\"p0091\" num=\"0086\">The term \"expression cassette\" refers to the complete elements required for expression of a gene, including promoters, gene coding sequences, and PolyA tailing signal sequences. Preferably further comprising an enhancer element.</p><p id=\"p0092\" num=\"0087\">The term \"immobilized\" refers to the covalent or non-covalent attachment of biomolecules such as proteins to a substrate, which may be an immobilized substrate such as a solid well plate, petri dish, slide, or the like, or a suspended substrate such as magnetic beads, nanoparticles, or the like.</p><p id=\"p0093\" num=\"0088\">The term \"specific binding\" refers to a reaction between an antibody or antigen binding fragment and an antigen to which it is targeted or between a receptor and its specific ligand. In certain embodiments, an antibody that specifically binds to (or has specificity for) an antigen means that the antibody binds to or has specificity for an antigen in an amount of less than about 10 <sup>-5</sup> M, e.g. less than about 10 <sup>-6</sup> M\u300110 <sup>-7</sup> M\u300110 <sup>-8</sup> M\u300110 <sup>-9</sup> M or 10 <sup>-10</sup> M or less affinity (KD) binds the antigen. \"specifically recognizing\" or \"targeting\" has similar meaning.</p><p id=\"p0094\" num=\"0089\">The term \"pharmaceutically acceptable excipients\" refers to carriers and/or excipients that are pharmacologically and/or physiologically compatible with the subject and active ingredient, which are well known in the art (see, e.g., remington's Pharmaceutical sciences. Mediated by Gennaro AR,19th ed.Pennsylvania:Mack Publishing Company,1995), and include, but are not limited to: pH adjusters, surfactants, adjuvants, ionic strength enhancers. For example, pH modifiers include, but are not limited to, phosphate buffers; surfactants include, but are not limited to, cationic, anionic or nonionic surfactants, such as Tween-80; ionic strength enhancers include, but are not limited to, sodium chloride. </p><p id=\"p0095\" num=\"0090\">The term \"operably linked\" refers to the functional relationship of a nucleic acid sequence to regulatory sequences of nucleotides (e.g., promoters, enhancers, transcription and translation termination sites, and other signal sequences) and indicates that two or more DNA fragments are joined together such that they function in concert for their intended purposes. For example, the operative linkage of a nucleic acid sequence (typically DNA) to a regulatory sequence or promoter region refers to the physical and functional relationship between the DNA and the regulatory sequence or promoter such that transcription of such DNA is initiated from the "
