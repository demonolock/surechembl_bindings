    "nies decreased. When cells were plated at a low density of 1.5 or 3.0 cells per square centimeter, the cells expanded up to 2,000-fold over about 10 days, as indicated In Figure 18A. In contrast, cells plated at 12 cells per square centimeter expanded only about 60-fold. When plated at low density, the ceUs typically exhibited three phases of growth: A lag phase, a log phase of rapid growth, and then a stationary phase (see Figure 18 A). During the log phase, the ceUs plated at \n\nlow density doubled an average of about twice per 24 hours, i.e. doubling tunes of about 12 hours, as indicated in Figure 18B. When cells were plated at 6 ceUs per square centimeter instead of 1.5 ceUs per square centimeter, the most rapid growth was at day 6 Instead of day 8. If cells were plated at 12 cells per square centimeter, the doubling time was reduced to about 24 hours throughout the culture period, as indicated in Figure 18B. Identification of a Sub-Population of Progenitors</p>\n  Cells obtained from stationary cultures of MSCs were assayed for size and granularity by forward Ught and side light scattering by FACS. Two populations of cells could be detected in stationary cultures, as indicated in Figure 19 A. Most of the cells were large and had a medium content of granules. However, there was a minor population of small and agranular ceUs. Staining with propidium iodide demonstrated that about 98% of the cells in both populations were viable. Staining with the cell-cycle specific antigen Ki-67 indicated that the small, agranular cells were not in cell cycle, whereas the larger ceUs were in cell cycle. A similar pattern of large and small cells was observed with cultures plated at 12 ceUs per square centimeter and examined after 5 days. However, a different pattern was seen with cultures that were plated at 1.5 or 3.0 cells per square centimeter and examined at 5 days. About 13% of these ceUs were small and agranular cells, but a new sub-population of small and granular cells accounted for about 30% of the total population, as Indicated in Figure 19B. Staining with Ki- 67 demonstrated that the small and granular cells were in cell cycle. For convenience, we here refer to the small and agranular cells as recycling stem ceUs-1 (RS-1), the small and granular ceUs as recycling stem cells-2 (RS-2), and the large and moderately granular ceUs as mature MSCs (mMSCs).</p>\n  Graphing of the data from the experiment for which results are presented in Figure 19 indicated that RS-2 cells first appeared and expanded during the lag period, as indicated in Figure 20. During the log phase of growth, the RS-2 ceUs decreased in number and the mMSCs rapidly expanded. During the late log phase, the RS-2 ceUs disappeared and the RS-1 ceUs expanded. Co\u03c0elation Between RS Cells and CFUs</p>\n  The data in Figures 19 and 20 indicate that the earliest progenitors in the cultures are RS-1 and RS-2 cells. Therefore, the number of RS-1 and RS-2 ceUs in any sample of MSCs should reflect the number of ceUs that generate single-cell derived colonies in CFU assays. As indicated h Figure 21, an approximately linear relationship was observed between the number \n\nof RS ceUs and CFU values obtained for a series of samples (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.95; p value = 0.001). Moreover, the slope of the plot was 0.82 \u00b1 0.96 S.D. Therefore, the results indicated that each RS ceU formed a colony with an average efficiency of about 82%. As also indicated in Figure 21, the same relationship between CFUs and total RS cells (RS-1 plus RS-2) was observed usmg samples obtained from the same cultu"
