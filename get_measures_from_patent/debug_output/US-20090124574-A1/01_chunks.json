    "tes, intramuscular routes, and direct absorption through mucous membrane tissues. The therapeutic agents can be administered by the same route or by different routes. For example, a first therapeutic agent of the combination selected may be administered by intravenous injection while the other therapeutic agents of the combination may be administered orally. Alternatively, for example, all therapeutic agents may be administered orally or all therapeutic agents may be administered by intravenous injection. The sequence in which the therapeutic agents are administered is not narrowly critical. \u201cCombination therapy\u201d also can embrace the administration of the therapeutic agents as described above in further combination with other biologically active ingredients (such as, but not limited to, additional pharmacologic agents) and non-drug therapies (such as, but not limited to, surgery or radiation treatment).</p>As used herein, the term \u201cinhibitor,\u201d when used in the context of receptor inhibitor, such as in \u201creceptor antagonist,\u201d generally refers to a molecule that binds to a specific receptor and decrease their the activity of that receptor by at least 5%, at least 15%, at least 30%, at least 50% or at least 75%. Many drug molecules are receptor antagonists so their discovery and improvement is an active area of research in biochemistry and pharmacology. A medicinal receptor antagonist is often judged by its specificity (its lack of binding to other proteins) and its potency (its dissociation constant, which indicates the concentration needed to inhibit the enzyme). A high specificity and potency ensure that a drug will have few side effects and thus low toxicity.</p>As used herein the terms \u201cadministration,\u201d \u201cadministering,\u201d or the like, when used in the context of providing a pharmaceutical or nutraceutical composition to a subject generally refers to providing to the subject one or more pharmaceutical, \u201cover-the-counter\u201d (OTC) or nutraceutical compositions in combination with an appropriate delivery vehicle by any means such that the administered compound achieves one or more of the intended biological effects for which the compound was administered. By way of non-limiting example, a composition may be administered parenteral, subcutaneous, intravenous, intracoronary, rectal, intramuscular, intra-peritoneal, transdermal, or buccal routes of delivery. Alternatively, or concurrently, administration may be by the oral route. The dosage administered will be dependent upon the age, health, weight, and/or disease state of the recipient, kind of concurrent treatment, if any, frequency of treatment, and/or the nature of the effect desired. The dosage of pharmacologically active compound that is administered will be dependent upon multiple factors, such as the age, health, weight, and/or disease state of the recipient, concurrent treatments, if any, the frequency of treatment, and/or the nature and magnitude of the biological effect that is desired.</p>As u"
