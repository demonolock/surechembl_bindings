    " INDOLE DERIVATIVES AS INHIBITORS OF FACTOR XA</p>The present invention relates to the inhibition of blood clotting proteins, and more particularly, to indole derivatives of the formula I,</p></p>in which R<sup>la</sup>, R<sup>1b</sup>, R<sup>1c</sup>, R<sup>1d</sup>, R<sup>2</sup>, R<sup>3</sup>, R<sup>4</sup> and A are defined as indicated below. The compounds of the formula I are inhibitors of the blood clotting enzyme factor Xa. The invention also relates to processes for the preparation of the compounds of the formula I, to methods of inhibiting factor Xa activity and of inhibiting blood clotting, to the use of the compounds of formula I in the treatment and prophylaxis of diseases which can be cured or prevented by the inhibition of factor Xa activity such as thromboembolic diseases, and to the use of the compounds of formula I in the preparation of medicaments to be applied in such diseases. The invention further relates to compositions containing a compound of the formula I in admixture or otherwise in association with an inert carrier, in particular pharmaceutical compositions containing a compound of the formula I together with pharmaceutically acceptable carrier substances and/or auxiliary substances.</p>The ability to form blood clots is vital to survival. In certain disease states, however, the formation of blood clots within the circulatory system is itself a source of morbidity. It is nevertheless not desirable in such disease states to completely inhibit the clotting system because life threatening \n\nhemorrhage would ensue. In order to reduce the instances of the intravascular formation of blood clots those skilled in the art have endeavored to develop an effective inhibitor of factor Xa, or prothrombinase, the enzyme which is incorporated into the prothrombinase complex where it serves to activate thrombin during clot formation. Appropriate concentrations of such an inhibitor would increase the level of prothrombinase forming agents required to initiate clotting, but would not unduly prolong the clotting process once a threshold concentration of thrombin had been obtained.</p>Blood coagulation is a complex process involving a progressively amplified series of enzyme activation re",
    "sion therapy due to the use of heparin also is approximately 7 %. Moreover, even though delayed closures are significant, administration of heparin after termination of the procedures is of little value and can be detrimental.</p>The most widely used blood-clotting inhibitors are heparin and the related sulfated polysaccharides, LMWH and heparin sulfate. These molecules exert their anti-clotting effects by promoting the binding of a natural regulator of the clotting process, anti-thrombin III, to thrombin and to factor Xa. The inhibitory activity of heparin primarily is directed toward thrombin, which is inactivated approximately 100 times faster than factor Xa. Although relative to heparin, heparin sulfate and LMWH are somewhat more potent inhibitors of Xa than of thrombin, the differences in vitro are modest (3 to 30 fold) and effects in vivo can be inconsequential. Hirudin and hirulog are two additional thrombin-specific anticoagulants presently in clinical trials. However, these anticoagulants, which inhibit thrombin, also are associated with bleeding complications. \n\nPreclinical studies in baboons and dogs have shown that specific inhibitors of factor Xa prevent clot formation without producing the bleeding side effects observed with direct thrombin inhibitors. Such factor Xa inhibitors include, for example, 2,7-bis-(4-amidinobenzylidene)-cycloheptanone and N(\u03b1)-tosyl-glycyl-3-amidinophenylalanine methyl ester (\"TENSTOP\"), which have effective inhibitory concentrations (Ki's) of about 20 nM and 800 nM, respectively. ( + )-(2S)-2-(4-({(3S)-1-acetimidoyl-3-pyrrolidinyl}oxy)phenyl)-3- (7-amidino-2-naphthyl)propanoic acid also is representative of a class of factor Xa inhibitors (Katakura et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 197 (1993), 965-972). Thus far, however, these compounds have not been developed clinically.</p>Several specific inhibitors of factor Xa have been reported. Both synthetic and protein inhibitors of factor Xa have been identified including, for example, antistasin (\"ATS\") and tick anticoagulant peptide (\"TAP\"). ATS, which is isolated from the leech, Haementerin officinalis, contains 119 amino acids and has a Ki for factor Xa of 0.05 nM. TAP, which is isolated from the tick, Ornithodoros moubata, contains 60 amino acids and has a Ki for factor Xa of about 0.5 nM.</p>The effectiveness of recombinantly-produced ATS and TAP have been investigated in a number of animal model systems. Both inhibitors decrease bleeding time compared to other anticoagulants, and prevent clotting in a thromboplastin-induced, ligated jugular vein model of deep vein thrombosis. The results achieved in this model correlate with results obtained using the current drug of choice, heparin.</p>Subcutaneous ATS also was found to be an effective treatment in a thromboplastin-induced model of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). TAP effectively prevents \"high-shear\" arterial thrombosis and \"reduced flow\" caused by the surgical placement of a polyester \n\n(\"DACRON\") graft at levels that produced a clinically acceptable prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), i.e., less than about two fold prolongation. By comparison, standard heparin, even at doses causing a five fold increase in the aPTT, did not prevent thrombosis and reduced flow within the graft. The aPTT is a clinical assay of coagulation which is particularly sensitive to thrombin inhibitors.</p>ATS and TAP have not been developed clinically. One major disadvantage of these two inhibitors is that administration of the required repeated doses causes the generation of neutralizing antibodies, thus limiting their potential clinical use. Moreover, the sizes of TAP and ATS render oral administration impossible, further restricting the number of patient",
    "ve been described. WO-A-95/29 189, for example, discloses factor Xa inhibitors which have a peptide like structure, and WO-A-97/08 165 discloses cyclic guanidines which inhibit factor Xa. In WO-A-97/21 437 naphthyl-substituted benzimidazoles are described which have an inhibitory activity against factor Xa and factor lla and which can be used as anti-coagulants, and in WO-A- 97/30 971 factor Xa inhibitory m-amidino phenyl analogs are described. But there is still a need for further factor Xa inhibitors having improved properties like a favorable pharmacological activity profile.</p>A specific inhibitor of factor Xa would have substantial practical value in the practice of medicine. In particular, a factor Xa inhibitor would be effective under circumstances where the present drugs of choice, heparin and related sulfated polysaccharides, are ineffective or only marginally effective. Thus, there exists a need for a low molecular weight factor Xa-specific blood clotting inhibitor that is effective, but does not cause unwanted side effects. The present invention satisfies this need by providing novel factor Xa \n\nactivity inhibiting indoie derivatives of the formula I and by providing related advantages as well.</p>As used herein, the term \"factor Xa activity\" refers to the ability of factor Xa, by itself or in the assembly of subunits known as the prothrombinase complex, to catalyze the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. When used in reference to factor Xa activity, the term \"inhibition\" includes both the direct and indirect inhibition of factor Xa activity. Direct inhibition of factor Xa activity can be accomplished, for example, by the binding of a compound of the formula I to factor Xa or to prothrombinase so as to prevent the binding of prothrombin to the prothrombinase complex active site. Indirect inhibition of factor Xa activity can be accomplished, for example, by the binding of a compound of the invention to soluble factor Xa so as to prevent its assembly into the prothrombinase complex. As used herein, the term \"specific\" when used in reference to the inhibition of factor Xa activity means that a compound of the formula I can inhibit factor Xa activity without substantially inhibiting the activity of other specified proteases, including plasmin and thrombin (using the same concentration of the inhibitor). Such proteases are involved in the blood coagulation and fibrinolysis cascade. The present invention provides novel compounds which inhibit factor Xa activity but do not substantially inhibit the activity of other proteases involved in the blood coagulation pathway.</p>Thus, a subject of the present invention are indoie derivatives of the formula I.</p>\nwherein two of the residues R<sup>1</sup>\", R<sup>1b</sup>, R<sup>1c</sup> and R<sup>1d</sup> independent of one another are hydrogen, F, CI, Br, I, (C<sub>r</sub>C<sub>4</sub>)-alkyl, CF<sub>3</sub>, phenyl, phenyl-(C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>4</sub>)-alkyl-, (C,- C<sub>4</sub>)-alkoxy, phenyloxy-, phenyl-(C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>4</sub>)-alkoxy-, OH, NO<sub>2</sub>, -NR<sup>5</sup>\"R<sup>5b</sup>, -NR<sup>\u03b4b</sup>-SO<sub>2</sub>-R<sup>\u03b2\u03b2</sup>, -S-R<sup>6</sup> , -SO.-R<sup>60</sup> where n is 1 or 2, -SO<sub>2</sub>-NR<sup>\u03b4a</sup>R<sup>5b</sup>, -CN or</p>-CO-R<sup>7</sup>, and are identical or different, and the other two of the residues R<sup>1a</sup>, R<sup>1b</sup>, R<sup>1c</sup> and R<sup>1d</sup> are hydrogen;</p>R<sup>5</sup>\" is hydrogen, (C<sub>r</sub>C<sub>4</sub>)-alkyl, phenyl, phenyl-(C<sub>r</sub>C<sub>4</sub>)-alkyl-, formyl, ((C C<sub>4</sub>)-alkyl)carbonyl-, ph",
    "res starting from suitably substituted compounds of the formula IX which are commercially available or which can be prepared according to or analogously to syntheses described in the literature. In the formulae la and IX the residues have the meanings defined above.</p></p>la IX</p>As is demonstrated in the pharmacological tests described below, the compounds of the formula I inhibit factor Xa activity. They can therefore advantageously be used as pharmaceuticals, especially when it is desired to reduce factor Xa activity or to produce effects that can be achieved by inhibiting factor Xa activity in a system, such as influencing coagulation or inhibiting blood clotting. Thus, the present invention aiso relates to the compounds of the formula I for use as pharmaceuticals as well as to the compounds of the formula I for use in the production of medicaments, especially of medicaments for treatment or prophylaxis of the conditions \n\nand diseases mentioned below and above. Further, the present invention provides a method of specifically inhibiting factor Xa activity by contacting factor Xa with a compound of the formula I, wherein a compound of the invention inhibits factor Xa catalytic activity either directly, within the prothrombinase complex or as a soluble subunit, or indirectly, by inhibiting the assembly of factor Xa into the prothrombinase complex. A preferred embodiment of the invention comprises such compounds of the formula I which can inhibit factor Xa activity with a Ki &lt; 100 \u03bcM and, more preferably, with a Ki &lt; 2 \u03bcM as determined in the factor Xa assay described below.</p>Inhibition of factor Xa activity or the production of effects achieved by such an inhibition can take place, for example, in vivo, i. e. in an individual. As used herein, the term \"individual\" means a vertebrate, including a mammal such as, for example a mouse, a rat, a rabbit, a dog, a pig and especially a human, in which factor Xa is involved in the coagulation cascade. It can also take place outside the body of an individual, for example, in an extracorporeal circulation or in the treatment of blood samples from an individual, and generally in vitro. In vitro uses of the compounds of the formula I are, for example, the use as a biochemical tool or reagent in scientific or analytical investigations or the use in in vitro diagnoses. Further, a compound of the formula I can advantageously be used as an anticoagulant which can be contacted with a blood sample to prevent coagulation. For example, an effective amount of a compound of the formula I can be contacted with a freshly drawn blood sample to prevent coagulation of the blood sample.</p>As used herein, the term \"effective amount\" when used in this connection means an amount of a compound of the formula I that inhibits factor Xa activity to the desired extent. The skilled artisan would recognize that an \n\neffective amount of a compound of the invention can be determined using the methods disclosed herein or otherwise known in the art.</p>In view of the disclosed utility of the compounds of the formula I, the skilled artisan also would recognize that an agent such as heparin can be replaced with a compou",
    "ts.</p>In a further embodiment, the present invention provides a method of inhibiting factor Xa in a patient in need thereof, comprising administering to said patient an effective factor Xa inhibitory amount of a compound of the formula I. As used herein, the term \"patient\" refers especially to a warmblooded animal including a mammal and particularly a human. A patient is in need of treatment to inhibit factor Xa when the patient is suffering from a disease state that can be beneficially influenced by inhibiting factor Xa activity or that is expected by the clinician to be beneficially influenced by inhibiting factor Xa acitivity. The identification of those patients who are in need of treatment to inhibit factor Xa is well within the ability and knowledge of one skilled in the art. A clinician skilled in the art can readily identify, for example by the use of clinical tests, physical examination and medical/family history, those patients who are in need of such a treatment.</p>Since a compound of the formula I can inhibit factor Xa activity, such a compound can be used for reducing or inhibiting blood clotting in an individual. Thus, the present invention further provides a method of reducing or inhibiting the formation of blood clots in an individual, especially in a patient in need thereof, by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the formula I. \n\nA \"therapeutically effective amount\" relating to the production in an individual of an effect like inhibition or reduction of blood clotting, or an \"effective factor Xa inhibitory amount\" of a compound of the formula I means the amount or the dose of a compound of the formula I that has to be administered to an individual in order to achieve or to maintain the desired effect, or to inhibit factor Xa activity in the individual to the desired extent. Such an effective amount or dose to be administered has to be adjusted to the individual circumstances in each case. It can be readily determined by the use of conventional techniques using the methods described herein or otherwise known in the art, and by observing results obtained under analogous circumstances. In determining the effective dose, a number of factors are considered including, but not limited to the species of the patient; its size, age, and general health; the specific disease involved; the degree or the involvement or the severity of the disease; the response of the individual patient; the particular compound administered; the mode of administration; the bioavailability characteristics of the pharmaceutical preparation administered; the dose regimen selected; and the use of concomitant medication. An appropriate dosage can be established using clinical approaches well known in the medical art.</p>In general, in view of the above factors it is evident that the effective factor Xa inhibitory amount or the therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the formula I will vary and can be varied within wide limit",
    "which are generally useful in High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis; organic solvents, such as acetonitrile, ethyl acetate, hexane and the like; and pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or auxiliary substances.</p>The compounds of the formula I can also be used as starting materials or chemical intermediates in the preparation of other compounds, especially in \n\nthe preparation of other pharmacologically active compounds. Examples for such conversions of compounds of the invention into other compounds of the invention are discussed above and are given in detail below. For this use, besides the compounds of the formula I and their physiologically acceptable salts also other salts of the compounds of the formula I can be useful which are not suitable or less suitable for use as pharmaceuticals. Thus, the present invention also relates to compounds of the formula I and their salts in general as chemical intermediates, especially as intermediates in the preparation of pharmacologically active compounds. A subject of the invention also are intermediates which are used in the syntheses of the compounds of the formula I described above and below, and their use as chemical intermediates, especially as intermediates in the preparation of pharmacologically active compounds.</p>The following tests can serve to investigate the pharmacological activity and to illustrate the utility of the compounds of the present invention as factor Xa inhibitors.</p>Test 1 : In Vitro Inhibition of Selected Purified Coagulation Enzymes and Other Serine Proteases</p>The ability of a compound of the formula I to inhibit factor Xa, thrombin, plasmin, elastase and trypsin may be assessed by determining the concentration of the compound of the formula I that inhibits enzyme activity by 50 % (IC<sub>50</sub>). Purified enzymes are used in chromogenic assays. To determine the inhibition constant Ki, the IC<sub>50</sub> value is corrected for competition with substrate using the formula</p>Ki = IC<sub>50</sub> x (1/{1 + ((substrate concentration)/substrate Km)}) \n\nwherein Km is the Michaelis-Menten constant (Chen and Prusoff, Biochem. Pharmacol. 22 (1973), 3099-3018 which is incorporated herein by reference).</p>a. Factor Xa Assay</p>TBS-PEG buffer (50 mM Tris-CI, pH 7.8, 200 mM NaCI, 0.05 % (w/v) PEG- 8000, 0.02 % (w/v) NaN<sub>3</sub>) is used for this assay. The IC<sub>50</sub> is determined by combining in appropriate wells of a Costar half-area microtiter plate 25 \u03bcl human factor Xa (Enzyme Research Laboratories, Inc.; South Bend, IN) in TBS-PEG; 40 \u03bcl 10 % (v/v) DMSO in TBS-PEG (uninhibited control) or various concentrations of the compound to be tested diluted in 10 % (v/v) DMSO in TBS-PEG; and substrate S-2765 (N(\u03b1)-benzyloxycarbonyl-D-Arg- Gly-L-Arg-p-nitroanilide; Kabi Pharmacia, Inc.; Franklin OH) in TBS-PEG.</p>The assay is performed by pre-incubating the compound of formula I plus enzyme for 10 min. Then the assay is initiated by adding substrate to obtain a final volume of 100 \u03bcl. The initial velocity of chromogenic substrate hydrolysis is measured by the change in absorbance at 405 nm using a Bio- tek Instruments kinetic plate reader (Ceres UV900HD at 25 \u00b0C during the linear portion of the time course (usually 1.5 min after addition of substrate). The concentration of inhibitor that causes a 50 % decrease in the rate of substrate hydrolysis is predicted by linear regression after plotting the relative rates of hydrolysis (compared to the uninhibi",
    "except that the substrate is S-2251 (D-Val-L- Leu-L-Lys-p-nitroanilide; Kabi) and the enzyme is human plasmin (Kabi). The enzyme concentration is 5 nM and the substrate concentration is 300 \u03bcM.</p>d. Trypsin Assay</p>TBS-PEG buffer containing 10 mM CaCI<sub>2</sub> is used for this assay. The IC<sub>60</sub> is determined as described above in the factor Xa assay, except that the substrate is BAPNA (benzoyl-L-Arg-p-nitroanilide; Sigma Chemical Co.; St. Louis MO) and the enzyme is bovine pancreatic trypsin (Type XIII, TPCK treated; Sigma). The enzyme concentration is 50 nM and the substrate concentration is 300 \u03bcM.</p>e. Elastase Assay</p>Tris-CI buffer (pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCI, 2 % (v/v) N-methyl-pyrrolidone, 0.01 % (w/v) NaN<sub>3</sub>) is used for this assay. The IC<sub>50</sub> is determined as described above for the assay for factor Xa, except that the substrate is succinyl-Ala- Ala-Ala-p-nitroanilide (Calbiochem-Nova Biochem Corp.; San Diego CA) and the enzyme is human neutrophil elastase (Athens Research and Technology, Inc.; Athens GA). The enzyme concentration is 75 nM and the substrate concentration is 600 \u03bcM. The control compound is \"TENSTOP\" (N(\u03b1)-tosyl- Gly-p-amidinophenylalanine methyl ester; American Diagnostica, Inc.; Greenwish CT), which is a reversible factor Xa inhibitor (Sturzebecher et al., Thromb. Res. 54 (1989), 245-252; Hauptmann et al., Thromb. Haem. 63 (1990), 220-223, each of which is incorporated herein by reference). \n\nTest 2: Assays for Determining Inhibition of Coagulation</p>The effectiveness of the compounds of the formula I may be assessed by the in vitro prothrombin time (PT) assay using pooled human donor plasma. An ex vivo assay may also be used in which plasma is collected at various times after intravenous (iv) administration of a compound of the formula I to rats or to rabbits, or after intraduodenal (id) administration to rats, and analysis using the PT assay to determine plasma half-life. The PT assay is initiated with a thrombopiastin dilution selected to obtain an extended and highly reproducible coagulation endpoint, referred to as the \"dilute PT assay\" as described below. The effectiveness of the compounds may also be determined using an in vivo rat arteriovenous shunt model of thrombosis.</p>a. In Vitro Dilute Prothrombin Time Assay 100 \u03bcl prewarmed (37 \u00b0C) pooled human platelet poor plasma (PPP) is added to a fibrometer cup (Baxter Diagnostics, Inc.; McGaw Park IL). 50 \u03bcl of various concentrations of a compound of the formula I in TBS-BSA with calcium (50 mM Tris-CI, 100 mM NaCI, 0.1 % (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA), 20 mM CaCI<sub>2</sub>) is added. In control experiments, TBS-BSA with calcium but without a test compound of the formula I is added for measurement of uninhibited coagulation time. 150 \u03bcl diluted prewarmed rabbit thrombopiastin (Baxter) with calcium is added to the fibrometer cup and the fibrometer timer is started. A rabbit thrombopiastin dilution curve is obtained prior to treating the compound and is used to choose a thrombopiastin dilution that allows approximately 30 sec PT time for uninhibited controls. The experimental concentration giving 50 % inhibition of coagulation (EC<sub>60</sub>) is calculated from the dilution curve times.</p>Alternatively, the dilute prothrombin time assay may be conducted using the \"research\" mode on an Instrumentation Laboratories (IL) ACL3000-plus automated coagulation instrument (IL; Milan, Italy). Thrombopiastin is \n\ndiluted until a clotting time of 30-35 seconds is achieved. This clotting time is taken as 100 % activity. A standard curve for calibration is established by serial 2-fold dilution of the diluted thrombopiastin reagent (rabbit brain IL- brand thrombopiastin). During the assay, a 50 \u03bcl sample (plasma separated by centrifugation) is mixed with 100 \u03bcl thrombopiastin reagent and nephelometric readings are taken over 169 sec. Coagulation time is determined from the maximal rate of change of light scatter calculated by the instrument. Inhibition is expressed as percent activity as determined by comparison with the calibration curve.</p>b. Ex Vivo Dilute Prothrombin Time Assay</p>A test compound of the formula I is administered iv either through the tail vein (rat) or ear vein (rabbit) following an approved protocol. Blood samples of 1 ml volume are removed at timed intervals after administration of the test compound from a cannulated carotid artery (rat) or auricular artery</p>(rabbit). After centrifugation to obtain PPP, the plasma is immediately stored on ice or frozen.</p>For dilute prothrombin time determination, the plasma is prewarmed and assayed as described above. Percent inhibition is calculated from a thrombopiastin dilution curve, which is run with each series of samples, and used to determine the time at which approximately 50 % of the initial anticoagulant activity remains in the plasma (T<sub>1/2</sub>).</p>The test compound of the formula I may also be administered to rats using an intraduodenal dosing protocol. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing approximately 300 g are anesthetized with a combination of ketamine/xylazine administered subcutaneously, following an approved protocol. The right carotid artery is cannulated for blood sampling. A laparotomy is performed and the duodenum is cannulated with a ball-tip needle and tied into place to ensure that the suture is distal to the point of \n\ninsertion. An additional tie is placed proximal to the insertion point to prevent leakage of gastric contents. The effectiveness of the suture in preventing a compound from reaching the site of insertion is tested by pressure testing at the conclusion of each experiment. The point of insertion is approximately 4 cm from the duodenal-gastric junction. The compound is administered in 1 ml normal saline. A blood sample of 0.7 ml is drawn prior to administration of the test compound of the formula I and at 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after administration. The plasma is separated by centrifugation and assayed for inhibition of coagulation using the dilute prothrombin time assay.</p>c. Rat Arteriovenous Shunt Model of Thrombosis</p>The anti-thrombotic efficacy of the compounds of the invention may be assessed using rat extracorporeal arteriovenous (AV) shunt. The AV shunt circuit consists of a 20 cm length of polyethylene (PE) 60 tubing inserted into the right carotid artery, a 6 cm length of PE 160 tubing containing a 6.5 cm length of mercerized cotton thread (5 cm exposed to blood flow), and a second length of PE 60 tubing (20 cm) completing the circuit into the left jugular vein. The entire circuit is filled with normal saline prior to insertion.</p>A test compound of the formula I is administered by continuous infusion into the tail vein using a syringe pump and butterfly catheter (infusion volume 1.02 ml/hr). The compound is administered for 30 min, then the shunt is opened and blood allowed to flow for a period of 15 min (total of 45 min infusion). At the end of the 15 min period, the shunt is clamped and the thread is carefully removed and weighed on an analytical balance. Percent inhibition of thrombus formation is calculated using the thrombus weight obtained from control rats, which are infused with saline. \n\nIn Table 1 some inhibition constants Ki for factor Xa inhibition by example compounds of the present invention are given. The inhibition constants were determined as described above (Test 1 , a., Factor Xa Assay).</p>Table 1 : Ki values for factor Xa inhibition</p>Example Ki (Xa) (\u03bcM) Example Ki (Xa) (\u03bcM)</p>2 0.10 97 1.60</p>4 0.090 101 7.9</p>6 0.40 103 1.7</p>13 55 106 0.04</p>15 13 110 1.1</p>21(4) 4.8 112 0.013</p>23 7.0 115 0.009</p>24 0.11 117 0.015</p>27 0.61 120 0.0048</p>35 0.009 121 0.13</p>39 0.007 124 0.025</p>47 0.007 125 0.009</p>56 0.082 132 2.0</p>58 0.014 133 0.05</p>77 0.009 137 0.011</p>78 0.21 141 0.72</p>81 63 146 0.013</p>84 0.90 149 3.3</p>87 110</p>As used herein, the following terms have the indicated meanings: \"g\" refers to grams; \"mmol\" refers to millimoles; \"mM\" refers to millimolar; \"ml\" refers to milliliters; \"m.p.\" refers to melting point; \"dec.\" refers to decomposition; \n\n\"\u00b0C\" refers to degrees Celsius; \"\u03bcl\" refers to microliters; \"nM\" refers to nanomolar and \"\u03bcM\" refers to micromolar.</p>Examples</p>The following examples present typical syntheses of the compounds of the formula I.
