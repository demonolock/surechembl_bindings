    "-luciferin.</p>\n  Ba/F3 FIP-PDGFR\u03b1 and Ba/F3 Tel-PDGFR\u03b2 cell lines, grown in suspension in RPMI 1640 (Invitromex, Cat.No.: L0501 ), 10 % fetal calf serum (Amimed, Cat.No.: 2-01 F86-I), 2 mM L- glutamine (Gibco), were seeded into black 96-well tissue culture plates (Packard) at a density of 10000 cells per well in 50 \u03bcL complete medium immediately followed by addition of 50 \u03bcL per well serial two-fold dilutions of 2x concentrated compounds (duplicates). Cells without compound were used as a control and medium without cells was used to determine the assay background signal. After 70 h incubation (37 <sup>0</sup>C, 5 % CO2), the cells were lysed by addition of 50 \u03bcL per well mammalian cell lysis solution (provided with the kit) and 5 min shaking in an orbital plate shaker at 700 rpm. Subsequently, 50 \u03bcL substrate solution (luciferase and D-luciferin) was added and after 5 min shaking and 10 min dark-adaptation of the plates, light emission was measured with a Packard TopCount. \n\nThe compound activity was determined as total growth inhibition (TGI) of the cell cultures and was calculated as follows: After subtraction of the background signal the signal obtained for the control cells was taken as 100 %. The effect of the compound was expressed as percent reduction of the control signal. The TGI50 values were determined from the dose response curves by graphical extrapolation.</p>\n  Compound (II) inhibited the proliferation of both Ba/F3 FIP-PDGFR\u03b1 and Ba/F3 TeI- PDGFR\u03b2 cells with IC50 values of &lt;100 nM.</p>\n  The T315I mutation in BCR-ABL confers resistance to imatinib and is not inhibited by any known small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The homologous mutation in TEL-PDGFR\u03b2 is T6811, and this mutation also confers imatinib-resistance. Compound (II) inhibited Ba/F3 cells transformed by a TEL-PDGFR\u03b2 T6811 mutant with an IC50 of &lt;25 nM, similar to that of the non-mutated TEL-PDGFR\u03b2 fusion.</p>\n  Western blots</p>\n  For F/P: Ba/F3 cells are incubated with the indicated concentrations of Compound (II) for 4 h in RPMI without FBS or IL-3. Cells are lysed in lysis buffer [PBS with 1 M Na<sub>2</sub>EDTA, 1 M NaF, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20OmM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 20OmM phenylarsine oxide and complete protease inhibitor tablets (Roche)]. 50\u03bcg of protein lysate is combined with reducing SDS loading buffer + dithiothreitol (Cell Signaling) prior to electrophoresis on 10-12% SDS-PAGE gels (Tris-HCL ready-gels, Bio-Rad) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Antibodies used are: phospho-PDGFR\u03b1 (Tyr 720), PDGFR\u03b1 951 , Stat5-b (Santa Cruz); phospho-Stat\u03b4 (Tyr 694) (Cell Signaling); anti-rabbit peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).</p>\n  For T/P: Ba/F3 cells stably expressing T/P or T/F are treated with serum starvation in plain RPMI 1640 for 4 hours prior to lysis. The cell extracts are clarified by centrifugation and used for immunoprecipitation or immunoblotting. The enzyme-linked immunoblotting procedures are performed as described. Applied antibodies include: rabbit anti-PDGFR\u03b2 serum (Pharmingen); rabbit anti-PI3K (p85) serum; mouse anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 \n\n(Upstate Biotechnology); antibodies against FGFR3, phospho-PI3K p85 (Tyr-508) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); PLC\u03b3, phospho-PLC\u03b3 (Tyr-783) (Cell Signaling).</p>\n  Bone marrow transplants and drug treatment of mice</p>\n  Murine bone"
