The final pellet was resuspended in 50 mM Tris buffer pH 7.4 containing 120 mM NaCI, 5 mM KCI, 2 mM CaC1<sub>2</sub>, and 1 mM MgCI<sub>2</sub>.</p>AssayPolypropylene incubation tubes received 100 \u00b5l of the individual test compounds at various concentrations dissolved or suspended in 0.05 M Tris, pH 7.4 containing 4 mg/ml methylcellulose, 100 \u00b5l of a solution of <sup>3</sup>H\u2015SCH 23390 in Tris buffer (final reaction mixture concentration =0.3 nM) or 100 \u00b5l of a solution of<sup>3</sup>H-spiperone in Tris buffer (final concentration = 0.2 nM) and 800 \u00b5l of tissue suspension (ca. 3 mg/assay). Tubes were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 15 minutes and rapidly vacuum filtered through Whatman\u00ae GF/B filters and rinsed 4 times with 4 ml of ice cold 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4. The filters were transferred to scintillation vials, equilibrated with 10 ml of scintillant (Scintosol, Isolab, Inc.) for 16 hours at 25\u00b0C and the radioactivity determined in liquid scintillation counter. K<sub>i</sub> values were determined as described by Billard et al. using the relationship K<sub>51</sub> = IC<sub>50</sub>/(1 + ([L]/K<sub>D</sub>)) wherein IC<sub>50</sub> = concentration of test drug necessary to displace 50% of specifically bouund <sup>3</sup>H-Sch 23390, [L] = concentration of radioligand used in the assay and K<sub>o</sub> = dissociation constant.</p>ResultsThe inhibition constants (K<sub>i</sub>) determined from the assays for a series of compounds of the invention are as shown in columns 6 and 7 of Table I below.\n<img id=\"ib0052\" path=\"imgb0052.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/197098427/EP/19900725/B1/000000/25/47/37/imgb0052.tif\"/></p>The comparatively small K<sub>;</sub> values of these compounds in the competitive binding assay with SCH 23390 indicate that the compounds of formula I bind strongly to the D-1 receptor site. The relatively high K<sub>;</sub> values for the D-2 site, for which spiperone is highly selective, indicate that the compounds are not specifically bound to that receptor site.</p>The antidepressive method of the invention is identified, for example, by test procedures which measure a compound's effect on tetrabenazine (TBZ)-induced ptosis in mice or which measure a compound's effect on muricide activity in rats as discussed below.</p>ANTIDEPRESSANT POTENTIALEFFECTS ON TETRABENAZINE (TBZ)-INDUCED PTOSIS IN MICEClinically active antidepressant drugs are known to block TBZ-induced ptosis in mice (Psychosomatic Medicine, Nodine and Moyer, Eds., Lea and Febiger, Philadelphia, 1962, pp 683-90). Activity in this test is used to predict anti-depressant activity in man.</p>Methods and MaterialsGroups of 5 mice are administered test drugs followed 30 minutes later by ip injection of tetrabenazine, 30 mg/kg. Thirty minutes later, the degree of ptosis is evaluated. Percenbt blockade of each treated group is used to determine ED<sub>50</sub>'s, defined as that dose which prevents ptosis in 50% of mice. ED<sub>so</sub>'s and 95% confidence limits are calculated by probit analysis.</p>EFFECTS ON MURICIDAL BEHAVIOR IN RATSBlockade of muricidal (mouse-killing) behavior in rats is used as a measure of evaluating the antidepressant activity of drugs (Int.

The bulk of the solvent was then evaporated, and the residue partitioned between 300 ml ether and 300 ml water. The aqueous layer was separated and washed with 100 ml of ether. The pH adjusted to 8-10 with solid KOH. This mixture was then extracted three times with 300 ml portions of ether, which were combined, dried, and evaporated to give 4.35 g an oily product.</p>4.0 g of this last material was dissolved in a mixture of 100 ml of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and 25 ml of dimethylformamide (DMF), cooled to about 0\u00b0C, and potassium t-butoxide (5.0 g) was added portion wise over 5 more minutes. The mixture was then diluted with 100 ml of ice water followed by 5.0 g solid NaHC0<sub>3</sub>. The resulting mixture was then poured into 400 ml of ether, and the organic layer separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with 400 ml ether, combined with the initial ether phase and washed twice with 100 ml portions of water.

The heterogeneous mixture was stirred vigorously while coming to room temperature overnight. The now homogeneous mixture was poured over crushed ice. With continuous vigorous stirring and cooling via an ice bath, the pH was raised to 8-10 by slow addition of 50% NaOH over 3 hrs. The mixture was extracted three times, with 500 ml of ethyl acetate, dried over magnesium sulfate, and evaporated to give 3.6 g crude oil. This material was dissolved in 200 ml of ethyl acetate and hydrogenated over 5% palladium on carbon at 344.7 kPa (50 psi). After filtration, the mixture was separated by HPLC on silica gel eluting with ethyl acetate to give 219 mg of "
