{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nK<sub>i</sub> values were determined as described by Billard et al. using the relationship K<sub>51</sub> = IC<sub>50</sub>/(1 + ([L]/K<sub>D</sub>)) wherein IC<sub>50</sub> = concentration of test drug necessary to displace 50% of specifically bouund <sup>3</sup>H-Sch 23390, [L] = concentration of radioligand used in the assay and K<sub>o</sub> = dissociation constant.\nThe comparatively small K<sub>;</sub> values of these compounds in the competitive binding assay with SCH 23390 indicate that the compounds of formula I bind strongly to the D-1 receptor site.\nED<sub>50</sub>'s, defined as that dose which prevents ptosis in 50% of mice. \n\n\nNote that there are no specific numeric values with units in the provided text snippet, so the extracted sentences may not fully meet the criteria. However, they do contain molecule names, bioactivity metrics, and some numeric values, which is why they are included in the output."}
