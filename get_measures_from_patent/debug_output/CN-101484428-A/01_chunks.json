    "ded in (20mM Tris pH7.5 in the store buffer liquid again; 1mM EDTA; And repeated centrifugation 10% glycerine).The particle that contains microsomal fraction that obtains is placed store buffer liquid once more, be divided into equal portions in liquid nitrogen freezing preservation until use.</p>Express the generation of the stable cell lines of 11 \u03b2-HSD1:</p>The identical construct that will be used for transient expression people 11 \u03b2-HSD1 also is used to set up this proteic clone of stably express.In brief, use fat transfection amine reagent (Gibco BRL) according to the explanation of manufacturers, with 11 \u03b2-HSD1 construct transfection (HEK293) cell.After the transfection 2 days, carry out Geneticin and select (0.8mg/ml), separate several stable clones.A clone is further used for pharmacology to be characterized.</p>Microsome test</p>Will be by the microsome (as detailed above) of the HEK293 cellular segregation of transient expression people 11 \u03b2-HSD1 at test damping fluid (100mM NaCl; 1mM EDTA; 1mM EGTA; 1mM MgCl; 250mM sucrose; 20mM Tris pH 7.4; Cortisone 50-200nM and NADPH 1mM) in the test substances incubation of different concns.At 37 \u2103 of incubations after 60 minutes, by being heated to 80 \u2103 (5 minutes) and adding inhibitor carbenoxolone (1 \u03bc M) termination test.Use commercially available hydrocortisone detection kit (by Assay Design, Inc. sells) to measure the amount of the hydrocortisone that produces in this test based on ELISA.Inhibitor characterizes with the IC50 value, i.e. the generation of hydrocortisone reduces by 50% concentration.</p>In this test, the IC50 value of preferred above-claimed cpd is less than 1000nM; The IC50 value of preferred compound is less than 100nM.The IC50 value of most preferred is less than 10nM.</p>Test cell line</p>In order to measure the effect of inhibitor in intact cell, on 96 orifice plates, the HEK293 cell (on seeing) of stably express people 11 \u03b2-HSD1 is cultivated in DMEM.In cell, add first inhibitor, add cortisone after 60 minutes.At 5%CO\n          <sub>2</sub>After 60 minutes, remove the part substratum in 37 \u2103 of incubations in the atmosphere, and use commercially available ELISA test kit (by Assay Design, Inc. sells) to measure the conversion of cortisone to hydrocortisone.\n        </p>What obtain in using the microsome test of representative compounds of the present invention as test compounds the results are shown in the following table:</p>What obtain in using the microsome test of representative compounds of the present invention as test compounds the results are shown in the following table:</p>Compoundh11-\u03b2-HSD1IC\n                      <sub>50</sub>(nM)\n                    Embodiment 16Embodiment 314</p>The IC of above-claimed cpd\n          <sub>50</sub>Value is less than 1000nM; The IC of preferred compound\n          <sub>50</sub>Value is less than 100nM.The more preferably IC of compound\n          <sub>50</sub>Value is less than 10nM.These results adopt above-mentioned test to obtain.\n        </p>Formula I compound and their pharmaceutical salts and ester can be used as the medicine form of pharmaceutical preparation (for example, with).Pharmaceutical preparation can take orally, as oral the form of "
