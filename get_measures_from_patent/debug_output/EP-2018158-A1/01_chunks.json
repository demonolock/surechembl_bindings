    "oavailability was assessed by measuring the levels of racecadotrilate, the active metabolite of racecadotril in the blood serum, at different times over a 24-hour period. For this, a highly specific and highly sensitive validated assay based on the HPLC / MS evaluation of pre-vascularised racecadotrilate was used. Several observations have indicated that, unexpectedly, the tablet formulation demonstrates a higher bioavailability profile, namely:</p>mean Tmax values, i.e., the periods required to observe peak blood levels after injection were 1.15 hours and 1.66 hours for tablets and capsules, respectively. This is unexpected insofar as the capsules generally make it possible to make the active ingredient bioavailable more quickly.</p>the total AUC values (Area under the curve) over 24 hours, expressed in nM.h, were 4669 and 2552 for tablets and capsules, respectively, corresponding to areas under the curve per mg of 13.34 and 8, 50 respectively. This indicates that racecadotril was more available 56% when formulated as tablets than in the standard capsule usually used. - The better bioavailability of the tablets thus allowed administration of the capsules twice a day in comparison with the current administration of three times a day. As a result,  Serum concentrations of racecadotrilate 12 hours after tablet administration (and immediately before the next administration) were still sufficiently high (approximately 4 nM) to inhibit the target enzyme enkephalinase, which has a Ki value of 2 nM for the metabolite active.</p>Example 4</p>Comparative clinical effect in severe diarrhea</p>This comparison was conducted in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 221 adult outpatients with acute diarrhea. Patients received either a 175 mg tablet twice daily (1 10 patients) or the traditional 100 mg capsule three times daily (111 patients). The inclusion criteria corresponded to the sudden onset of acute diarrhea, defined by the presence of at least three liquid or semi-solid stools during the last 24 hours and for a duration not exceeding 72 hours. The non-inclusion criteria included the presence of blood or pus in the stool as well as chronic diarrhea. The primary endpoint was the number of diarrheal stools that occurred between the start of treatment and healing or day 7 if the patients were not cured. Additional criteria included percentage of cure at the final visit, duration of diarrhea, change in associated symptoms, need for additional treatment, percent disappearance of diarrhea.</p>The treatments started during the first visit; patients were also observed at day 3 and day 7 and had to fill out an agenda describing their symptoms. The mean number of diarrheal bowel movements before cure, that is, the primary efficacy endpoint, was 4 \u00b1 3.8 for tablets versus 6.2 \u00b1 11.2 for capsules. The comparison of these values by means of a square root transformation and adjustment of the severity of the  Baseline diarrhea demonstrated that twic"
