Following incubation for 1 hour at 37\u00b0 C., the beads were washed and fluorescence was measured using flow cytometry and a plot of median fluorescent intensity versus aptamer concentration (FIG. 6B) was used to determine the apparent binding constant for each clone. Apparent K<sub>d </sub>values were obtained using the equation Y=Bmax*X/(KD+X). The apparent binding constant for each clone is also reported in Table 5. The apparent affinity of aptamers to fD ranged from approximately 3 to 20 nM.</p>F.

For the competition assays, beads labelled with fD were first incubated with 50 nM round or individual aptamer, in 50 \u03bcl SB1T (with ssDNA and BSA), for 30 mins at 37\u00b0 C. The beads were then washed with SB1T to remove unbound aptamers and incubated with or without 100 nM AFD for 30 mins at 37\u00b0 C. Following incubation, the beads were washed three times with SB1T, and assayed by flow cytometry (FIG. 7). These assays revealed that binding of AFD reduced the aptamer signal by \u02dc75%-\u02dc90%, for both the Round 7 and 8 populations as well all selected aptamers.
