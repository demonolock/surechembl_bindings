    "o putative N-glycosylation sites and bold amino acid residues (LK &amp; DI) correspond to linkers between hsTNALP and Fc, and Fc and D10 domains respectively. These linkers are derived from endonuclease restriction sites introduced during cDNA engineering;</p>FIG. 4 graphically presents the comparative expression of sTNALP-D10 and sTNALP-FcD10 in CHO-DG44 cells;</p>FIG. 5 presents sTNALP-FcD10 purification on protein-A Sepharose molecular sieve chromatography on Sephacryl\u2122 3-300 as well as SDS-PAGE analysis of purified sTNALP-FcD10 under reducing (DTT+) and non reducing (DTT\u2212) conditions. It also presents a schematized version of sTNALP-FcD10. The protein purified by Protein A-Sepharose\u2122 affinity chromatography was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and bands stained with Sypro\u2122 Ruby. Main species of sTNALP-FcD10 migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 90,000 Da under reducing conditions and 200,000 Da under non reducing conditions;</p>FIG. 6 presents the position of the papain cleavage site in sTNALP-FcD10;</p>FIG. 7 presents a non denaturing SEC-HPLC analysis of sTNALP-FcD10 on TSK-Gel G3000WXL column. Plain curve: papain digested sample. -X- curve: identical sample incubated in the same conditions without papain (control);</p>FIG. 8 presents a SDS-PAGE analysis of sTNALP-FcD10 incubated with or without papain showing which fragment is responsible for which band on the gel. Analysis was performed under reducing (+DTT) or non reducing (\u2212DTT) conditions;</p>FIG. 9 presents an in vitro binding assay. sTNALP-FcD10 and bovine kidney tissue non specific alkaline phosphatase were compared in the reconstituted mineral binding assay as described in Example 2. Total activity is the sum of the enzymatic activity recovered in the free and bound fractions. Total activity was found to be 84% and 96% of initial amount of enzymatic activity introduced in each set of assays for the bovine and sTNALP-FcD10 forms of enzyme, respectively. Results are the average of two bindings;</p>FIG. 10 presents pharmacokinetic and distribution profiles of sTNALP-FcD10 in serum, tibia and muscle of adult WT mice. Concentrations of sTNALP-FcD10 in serum, tibia and muscle, is expressed in \u03bcg/g tissue (wet weight) after a single bolus intravenous injection of 5 mg/kg in adult WT mice;</p>FIG. 11 presents pharmacokinetic profile of sTNALP-FcD10 serum concentration in newborn WT mice. Serum concentrations of sTNALP-FcD10 as a function of time after a single i.p. (panel A) or s.c. (panel B) injection of 3.7 mg/kg in (1 day old) newborn WT mice;</p>FIG. 12 presents the predicted pharmacokinetic profile of sTNALP-FcD10 in serum. Predicted maximal (Cmax) and minimal (Cmin) circulating steady-state levels of sTNALP-FcD10 after repeated (every 24 hrs) subcutaneous injections of 10 mg/Kg in newborn mice;</p>FIG. 13 presents the experimentally tested pharmacokinetic profile of sTNALP-FcD10 in the serum of newborn mice. Measured minimal (Cmin) circulating steady-state levels of sTNALP-FcD10 24 h after the last subcutaneous injections of 10 mg/Kg in newborn mice.
