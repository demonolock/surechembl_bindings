    " the control compound 4-bromo PHL 5 showed 79% inhibition at a 1:1 ratio with native ligand 1 (entry 5; both ligands at 5 \u03bcM). This result supported our hypothesis that PHLs could modulate LuxR function. Indeed, 50% of the PHL library 11 exhibited \u226750% inhibition in this assay. Inhibitory activity was extremely dependent on the substituents and their relative locations on the phenylacetanoyl group. For example, replacement of the 4-bromide with a hydrogen in PHL 11a abolished inhibitory activity (entry 6). PHLs with bromo (5, 11a-b), chloro (11g-i), and iodo substituents (11j-l) exhibited a ca. 10% increase in antagonism as the halogen was moved from the 2- to the 3- to the 4-position on the phenyl ring. Antagonistic activity also increased slightly with increasing halogen size, with 4-iodo PHL 11j exhibiting the highest activity (entry 15; 85%) for the halogen series.</p>In general, sterically large and lipophilic groups in the 4-position enhanced PHL (11) antagonism in V. fischeri (\u0394-luxI). This is exemplified by the high activities of 4-phenyl PHL 11q and 4-trifluoromethyl PHL 11s (ca. 80% inhibition; FIG. 2). In contrast, hydrogen-bond donating substituents in the 4-position engendered the lowest inhibitory activities (i.e., 4-amino PHL 11v and 4-hydroxy PHL 11w). The nitro PHL series (11m-o), however, showed a more complicated activity trend, with 3-nitro PHL 11n showing no inhibitory activity relative to the 2- and 4-nitro PHLs (entries 18-20; see below). We determined IC50 values for the most potent PHL inhibitors identified in this assay, along with the most potent controls (2 and 5) for comparison. The 4-iodo PHL 11j and 4-trifluoromethyl PHL 11s exhibited the lowest IC50 values in this study, with PHL 11s at least two-fold more active than control compound 2 (0.6 \u03bcM vs. 1.4 \u03bcM, respectively.</p>Similar assays were performed on PHL library 11 to screen for agonistic activity in V. fischeri (\u0394-luxI). Again, we observed striking trends in the activities for PHLs with halogen and nitro groups (at 200 \u03bcM compound; FIG. 2). In contrast to the antagonism data, the 3-substituted compound in each of these PHL families showed the strongest activity relative to the 2- and 4-substituted derivatives, with the 3-bromo 11b, 3-chloro 11h, and 3-nitro 11n PHLs exhibiting at least 60% luminescence induction relative to native OHHL at the same concentration. Remarkably, simply shifting substituents on the PHL phenyl ring by a single carbon converted these ligands from LuxR antagonists to LuxR agonists. Moreover, 3-nitro PHL 11n was able to induce 29% higher luminescence than OHHL in this primary assay (entry 19). This result was extraordinary, and explained the unusual inhibition trends for the nitro PHL series (11m-o; see above).</p>For a more quantitative comparison of ligand activity, we determined EC50 values for our most active PHL agonists (11b, 11h, and 11n) and OHHL in V. fischeri (\u0394-luxI). These studies identified 3-nitro PHL 11n as the most active LuxR agonist, exhibiting a ten-fold lower EC50 than OHHL (0.3 \u03bcM vs. 3 \u03bcM, respectively). We performed analogous dose-response studies with 11n and OHHL in wild-type V. fischeri ES114, and observed similarly heightened activity for PHL 11n relative to OHHL. The super-agonistic activity of PHL 11n in V. fischeri relative to OHHL could be easily visualized by luminescence imaging with a CCD camera. We also examined the activity of 11n and OHHL in a \u0394-luxR derivative of V. fischeri ES114. Neither 11n nor OHHL induced any detectable luminescence in this strain, which suggests that 11n, like the native ligand OHHL, exerts its activity through the LuxR protein (see below). The discovery of compound 11n is significant, as it is one of the first synthetic super-agonist of quorum sensing reported and to our knowledge the first super-agonist active in V. fischeri. </p>In view of the structural similarity of PHLs 11 to native AHLs and the assay data and subtle SAR described above, these ligands likely target the LuxR ligand-binding site and inhibition or activation is based on the specific binding mode and thus resulting affinity of the ligand. Further, we do not believe that these changes in activity simply reflect the different chemical properties of the PHLs. This view is supported by several observations. First, the percentage of PHL 11 lactone hydrolysis (which abolishes activity for native AHLs) is minimal and identical to that of OHHL over the time course of these luminescence assays. Second, higher lipophilicity within ",

    "ed AHL libraries against LuxR-type receptors. We focused on these most active QscR agonists and antagonists for the remainder of this study. No AHLs were identified in the primary assay with agonistic activities that surpassed that of controls OdDHL (1) or DDHL (2). Not surprisingly, many of these compounds had structures closely related to that of OdDHL (1), e.g., A3, A4, A8, A16, and OOHL (3), corroborating data reported by Lee et al. in this same reporter strain. However, the remaining four AHLs (B2, B7, C22, and D7) had structures that diverged from those of 1 or 2, most notably B2, which had D-stereochemistry. All four AHLs contained aromatic acyl groups. We previously observed that A4, A8, B2, and C22, but not A16 and D7, are also weak to strong activators of LasR. More notably, however, the other three QscR activators, OOHL (3), A3, and B7, are also capable of inhibiting LasR (by \u226750%). These screening data suggest that activation of QscR by AHLs is not restricted to unbranched, aliphatic AHLs. Moreover, they indicate that the development of ligands that specifically modulate QscR instead of LasR, or that activate or inhibit both receptors, will be feasible. A recent report by M\u00fch et al. of a non-AHL ligand (termed TP-1) that activates LasR, yet does not activate QscR, provides further support for these data.</p>We performed dose response agonism assays on the most active AHLs in this set and OdDHL (1) and DDHL (2) using the \u03b2-gal reporter strain, and determined their EC50 values. These assays revealed that the control DDHL (2) and A4 exhibited the lowest EC50 values in this study (i.e., \u02dc5 nM), with OOHL (3) having the next lowest value; these trends were congruent with our primary agonism assay data.</p>The antagonism assay of the AHL library revealed five non-native AHLs capable of inhibiting QscR by \u226775%. Four phenylacetanoyl HLs (PHLs) were uncovered as slightly weaker QscR antagonists (\u02dc70%) and are also included here in our data analysis.</p>Like the QscR agonists, the acyl chain structures of these QscR antagonists ranged from relatively compact (B6) to long and lipophilic (D13), making the development of specific structure-activity relationships (SARs) for AHL-mediated QscR inhibition challenging. Some trends were clear, however. All of the QscR antagonists contained aromatic acyl groups and native (L) lactone stereochemistry. Three of the most effective inhibitors had benzoyl groups (B6, D12, and D13); potent LuxR-type receptor inhibitors with this type of acyl chain are yet to be reported. PHLs were also strong antagonists of QscR (i.e., the C# AHLs), with C18 the most active QscR antagonist uncovered in this study (IC50=30 nM. This PHL is only a weak LasR inhibitor (20%); however, PHLs C6, C8, C11, and C14 with meta-halogen or nitro groups are also moderate antagonists of LasR (\u02dc50%). None of the other QscR antagonists displayed appreciable inhibitory activity against LasR. Interestingly, the other active PHL identified in this study, C22, is an activator of QscR at the concentration tested, and further highlights PHLs as a versatile structure class for the development of both inhibitors and activators of LuxR-type receptors.</p>We sought to obtain further insights into the mechanism of QscR modulation by non-native AHLs. Previous work has shown that QscR specifically binds the promoter region of the PA1897 gene in the presence of OdDHL (1). In view of the reporter gene assay data outlined above, we reasoned that our QscR antagonists could competitively inhibit the binding of QscR to DNA in the presence of OdDHL (1). We therefore performed electromobility shift assays (EMSA) on purified QscR and radiolabeled PA1897 promoter in the presence of selected QscR antagonists and 1.</p>The EMSAs revealed that all five AHLs (B6, C18, C25, D12, and D13) were capable of inhibiting OdDHL (1)-dependent QscR:DNA binding. At a 100:1 ratio with OdDHL (1), PHL C18 inhibited OdDHL-dependent binding by 85%, while D12 was 26% inhibitive. This activity trend correlated well with the cell-based reporter assays, where C18 had a six-fold lower IC50 relative to D12. All of the antagonists could further retard QscR:DNA binding at 1000:1 ratios vs. OdDHL (1), with C18 and D13 reducing binding by 100%. These data suggest that the mechanism of QscR antagonism by these synthetic AHLs is inhibition of OdDHL (1)-dependent QscR:DNA binding. We speculate that these ligands directly bind QscR and/or displace OdDHL (1), yielding a QscR:AHL complex with lowered affinity for the PA1897 promoter sequence. In turn, we hypothesize that our AHL activators bind QscR and promote QscR:DNA binding; EMSAs on selected synthetic QscR agonists are ongoing to probe this model.</p>In summary, we have identified a series of AHLs that are capable of activating or inhibiting the LuxR-type receptor, QscR, from P. aeruginosa. Several of the antagonists were capable of inhibiting OdDHL (1)-dependent QscR:DNA binding. These ligands represent the first non-native small molecule modulators of QscR. We have also discovered synthetic AHLs that either selectively activate or inhibit QscR instead of LasR, or activate or inhibit both receptors. The most interesting non-native ligand in this class is perhaps AHL B7, as it can moderately activate QscR and has previously been shown to strongly inhibit LasR. This bifunctional compound represents a unique tool to probe the role of QscR as a negative regulator of QS pathways in P. aeruginosa. Activating QscR, while simultaneously repressing LasR, could have a synergistic effect on virulence inhibition in P. aeru"
