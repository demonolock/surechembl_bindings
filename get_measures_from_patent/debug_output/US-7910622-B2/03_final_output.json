For a more quantitative comparison of ligand activity, we determined EC50 values for our most active PHL agonists (11b, 11h, and 11n) and OHHL in V. fischeri (Δ-luxI). These studies identified 3-nitro PHL 11n as the most active LuxR agonist, exhibiting a ten-fold lower EC50 than OHHL (0.3 μM vs. 3 μM, respectively)."

These assays revealed that the control DDHL (2) and A4 exhibited the lowest EC50 values in this study (i.e., ˜5 nM), with OOHL (3) having the next lowest value; these trends were congruent with our primary agonism assay data.\n2. PHLs were also strong antagonists of QscR (i.e., the C# AHLs), with C18 the most active QscR antagonist uncovered in this study (IC50=30 nM.\n3. This PHL is only a weak LasR inhibitor (20%); however, PHLs C6, C8, C11, and C14 with meta-halogen or nitro groups are also moderate antagonists of LasR (˜50%). \n\nNote that there are limited sentences that meet the criteria, as most of the text describes general trends and methods rather than specific molecule-metric-value-unit combinations."
