Luciferase activity is measured using luciferase reagents from Promega. c. Analysis of Results: Each treatment consists of at least 4 replicates. Log transformed data are used for analysis of variance and nonlinear dose response curve fitting for both agonist and antagonist modes. Huber weighting is used to downweight the effects of outliers.
