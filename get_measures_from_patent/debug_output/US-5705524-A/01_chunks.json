    "The antibodies and labeled ligands herein optionally are assembled into kits for use in therapeutic drug monitoring or evaluation, or for process quality control, and used in the conventional manner.</p>The invention also relates to methods of detecting HIV protease in a sample suspected of containing HIV protease comprising the steps of: treating a sample suspected of containing HIV protease with a composition comprising a compound of the invention bound to a label; and observing the effect of the sample on the activity of the label.</p>Compositions of the invention are inhibitors of HIV protease. As such frequently the compositions will bind to locations on the surface or in a cavity of HIV protease having a geometry unique to HIV protease. Compositions binding HIV protease may bind with varying degrees of reversibility. Those compounds binding substantially irreversibly are ideal candidates for use in this method of the invention. Once labeled, the substantially irreversibly binding compositions become probes for the detection of HIV protease.</p>Uses of the Compounds of the Invention.</p>Compositions of the invention are screened for inhibitory activity against HIV protease by any of the conventional techniques for evaluating enzyme activity. Within the context of the invention, typically compositions are first screened for inhibition of HIV protease in vitro and compositions showing inhibitory activity are then screened for activity in vivo. Compositions having in vitro Ki (inhibitory constants) of less then about 5\u00d710<sup>-6</sup> M, typically less than about 5\u00d710<sup>-7</sup> M and more typically less than about 5\u00d710<sup>-8</sup> M are excellent candidates for in vivo screening.</p>Useful in vitro screens have been described in detail and will not be elaborated here. However, the above cited work of Billich, A.; Billich, S.; and Rosenwirth, B.; Antiviral Chem. &amp; Chemoth., 1991, 2(2), 65-73, discloses suitable assays for HIV protease.</p>Useful in vivo screens have also been described. The above cited work of Wong, Y.; Burcham, D.; Saxton, P.; Erickson-Viitanen, S.; Grubb, M.; Quon, C.; and Huang, S.-M.; Biopharm. &amp; Drug Disp., 1994, 15, 535-544, discloses suitable pharmacokinetic evaluation of HIV protease inhibitors in rats and dogs.</p>Another typical assay is described below in the Examples section of this specification.</p>The compositions of the invention bind HIV protease. Accordingly, they are useful in any of the assay methods described. They are also inhibitors of HIV protease, and as a result are useful as negative controls and analytical standards in any of the described methods of assay for HIV protease activity. These uses are distinct in that a composition of the invention which binds HIV protease, whether in an inhibitory manner or not, is useful for immobilizing HIV protease in any heterogeneous assay system. A composition which inhibits HIV protease is useful for suppressing HIV protease in an assay which detects H",

The reaction was concentrated to remove volatiles and extracted between methylene chloride and water to afford the vinyl sulfone (Scheme 8, structure 42 R=m-nitrobenzyl) (90 mg) as an oil. Rf 0.68 (5% ethyl acetate/methylene chloride).</p>Part 4: To a solution of vinyl sulfone (Scheme 8, structure 42 R=m-nitrobenzyl) (89 mg) in ethanol (2 mL) was added benzyl amine (90 mg). The mixture was concentrated under vacuum and redissolved in ethanol (2 mL). After stirring for 72 h, an additional portion of benzyl amine (90 mg) was added and stirred for an additional 24 hrs. The mixture was concentrated under vacuum and chromatographed on silica gel with hexane followed by 20% ethyl acetate in hexane to provide the amine (Scheme 17, structure 205 R=m-nitrobenzyl) as an oil (69.6 mg).</p><sup>1</sup> H-NMR (CDCL<sub>3</sub>) d 8.4-7.0 (19H), 5.18 (d, J=12.8 Hz, 1H), 4.979 (t, J=8.8 Hz, 1H), 4.54 (d, J=12.9 Hz), 4.24 (dd, J=9.1, 1.1 Hz), 1H), 4.01 (dd, J=2.9, 1.1 Hz, 1H), 3.76 (dd, J=13.9, 3.3 Hz, 1n), 3.68 (m, 2H), 3.53 (d, J=13.9 Hz, 1H), 3.42 (dt, J=11.7, 3.3, 3.3, 1H), 3.25 (dd, J=13.9, 10.2 Hz, 1H), 3.10 (d, J=8.4 Hz, 1H), 2.75 (dd, J=13.6, 12.4 Hz, 1H)</p>              TABLE 25                                                    \n______________________________________                                    \nTable/Compound                                                            \n             Apparent Enzyme IC50                                         \n                            Cell Culture IC50                             \n______________________________________                                    \n107/2        +              N/T                                           \n107/3        ++             N/T                                           \n107/4        ++             +                                             \n107/5        +++            +                                             \n107/8        +              N/T                                           \n107/10       ++             N/T                                           \n107/12       ++             N/T                                           \n107/13       +              N/T                                           \n107/15       ++             N/T                                           \n108/3        ++             ++                                            \n108/4        +++            +++                                           \n108/5        +++            +++                                           \n108/17       N/T            ++                                            \n108/17       ++             N/T                                           \n108/18       +++            +                                             \n108/21       +++            +++                                           \n108/27       +              +                                             \n120/2        +++            +                                             \n120/3        +++            +            "
