{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that contain all four required components: a specific molecule name, ID or other identifier, a bioactivity metric (IC50, Ki, Kd, EC50), a specific numeric value for that metric, and a unit for that value. The text primarily describes assay methods and does not provide specific bioactivity data for individual molecules."}
