    "can be performed by measurement of incorporation of \u03b3-<sup>33</sup>P ATP into immobilized myelin basic protein (MBP). High binding white 384 well plates (Greiner) are coated with MBP (Sigma #M-1891) by incubation of 60 \u03bcL/well of 20 \u03bcg/mL MBP in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 138 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl) for 24 hours at 4\u00b0 C. Plates are washed 3\u00d7 with 100 \u03bcL TBS. Kinase reactions are carried out in a total volume of 34 \u03bcL in kinase buffer (5 mM Hepes pH 7.6, 15 mM NaCl, 0.01% bovine gamma globulin (Sigma #I-5506), 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 0.02% TritonX-100). Compound dilutions are performed in DMSO and added to assay wells to a final DMSO concentration of 1%. Each data point is measured in duplicate, and at least two duplicate assays are performed for each individual compound determination. Enzyme is added to final concentrations of 10 nM or 20 nM, for example. A mixture of unlabeled ATP and \u03b3-<sup>33</sup>P ATP is added to start the reaction (2\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>cpm of \u03b3-<sup>33</sup>P ATP per well (3000 Ci/mmole) and 10 \u03bcM unlabeled ATP, typically. The reactions are carried out for 1 h at rt with shaking Plates are washed 7\u00d7 with TBS, followed by the addition of 50 \u03bcL/well scintillation fluid (Wallac). Plates are read using a Wallac Trilux counter. This is only one format of such assays; various other formats are possible, as known to one skilled in the art.</p>The above assay procedure can be used to determine the IC<sub>50 </sub>for inhibition and/or the inhibition constant, K<sub>i</sub>. The IC<sub>50 </sub>is defined as the concentration of compound required to reduce the enzyme activity by 50% under the condition of the assay. The IC<sub>50 </sub>value is estimated by preparing a 10 point curve using a \u00bd log dilution series (for example, a typical curve may be prepared using the following compound concentrations: 10 \u03bcM, 3 \u03bcM, 1 \u03bcM, 0.3 \u03bcM, 0.1 \u03bcM, 0.03 \u03bcM, 0.01 \u03bcM, 0.003 \u03bcM, 0.001 \u03bcM and 0 \u03bcM).</p>PI3 Kinase General Assay Protocol</p>PI3K (p110\u03b1/p85\u03b1) (h) [Non-Radioactive Assay]</p>PI3K (p110\u03b1/p85\u03b1) (h) is incubated in assay buffer containing 10 \u03bcM phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and MgATP (concentration as required). The reaction is initiated by the addition of the ATP solution. After incubation for 30 minutes at room temperature, the reaction is stopped by the addition of stop solution containing EDTA and biotinylated phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate. Finally, detection buffer is added, which contains europium-labelled anti-GST monoclonal antibody, GST-tagged GRP1 PH domain and streptavidin allophycocyanin. The plate is then read in timeresolved fluorescence mode and the homogenous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) signal is determined according to the formula HTRF=10000\u00d7(Em665 nm/Em620 nm).</p>PI3K (p110\u03b2/p85\u03b1) (h) [Non-Radioactive Assay]</p>PI3K (p110\u03b2/p85\u03b1) (h) is incubated in assay buffer containing 10 \u03bcM phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate and MgATP (concentration as required).

The reaction is initiated by the addition of the MnATP mix. After incubation for 40 minutes at room temperature, the reaction is stopped by the addition of 3% phosphoric acid solution. 10 \u03bcL of the reaction is then spotted onto a P30 filtermat and washed three times for 5 minutes in 75 mM phosphoric acid and once in methanol prior to drying and scintillation counting.</p>The kinase assays described herein were performed at Millipore UK Ltd, Dundee Technology Park, Dundee DD2 1 SW, UK.</p>TABLE 5Kinase inhibition dataIC<sub>50 </sub>(nM)PI3K (h)Example #p110\u03b1/p85\u03b1p110\u03b2/p85\u03b1p110\u03b4/p85\u03b1p120\u03b3Ex. 1NTNT5NTEx. 2NTNT2NTEx. 3NTNT2NTEx. 414723011387Ex. 5&gt;30002596388Ex. 6NTNT18NTEx. 7NTNT4NTEx. 827633174Ex. 926782264255Ex. 11148210213375Ex. 12NTNT12NTEx. 16NTNT190NTEx. 18NTNT32NTEx. 19NTNT46NTEx. 21NTNT15NTEx. 22NTNT3NTEx. 23NTNT3NTEx. 2430738315NT: Not tested</p>Alternatively, the kinase activities of the compounds can be measured using KINOMEscan\u2122, which is based on a competition binding assay that quantitatively measures the ability of a compound to compete with an immobilized, active-site directed ligand. The assay was performed by combining three components: DNA-tagged kinase; immobilized ligand; and a test compound. The ability of the test compound to compete with the immobilized ligand was measured via quantitative PCR of the DNA tag.</p>For most assays, kinase-tagged T7 phage strains were prepared in an E. coli host derived from the BL21 strain. E. coli were grown to log-phase and infected with T7 phage and incubated with shaking at 32\u00b0 C. until lysis. The lysates were centrifuged and filtered to remove cell debris. The remaining kinases were produced in HEK-293 cells and subsequently tagged with DNA for qPCR detection. Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were treated with biotinylated small molecule ligands for 30 minutes at room temperature to generate affinity resins for kinase assays. The liganded beads were blocked with excess biotin and washed with blocking buffer (SEABLOCK\u2122 (Pierce), 1% BSA, 0.05% TWEEN\u00ae20, 1 mM DTT) to remove unbound ligand and to reduce nonspecific binding. Binding reactions were assembled by combining kinases, liganded affinity beads, and test compounds in 1\u00d7 binding buffer (20% SEABLOCK\u2122, 0.17\u00d7PBS, 0.05% TWEEN\u00ae20, 6 mM DTT). All reactions were performed in polystyrene 96-well plates in a final volume of 0.135 mL. The assay plates were incubated at room temperature with shaking for 1 hour and the affinity beads were was"
