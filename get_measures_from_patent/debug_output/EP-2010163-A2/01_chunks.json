    "ls is carried out by pouring carefully, so as to obtain an ethanol-water interface, in a tube and in the following order:</p>1 ml of a solution (Sl) of 0.01 M calix [n] arene in ethanol,</p>1 ml of 95% ethanol,</p>1 ml of distilled water, and  1 ml of a solution (S2) of 0.01 M of biologically active molecule in distilled water.</p>Then we close the tube. The co-crystals are formed at the water-ethanol interface and are recovered after four days.</p>I .2 Data Collection</p>All diffraction instruments have the following components: a radiation source (KCCD difractometer), a sample positioning fixture, a detector and a computerized control and data collection system.</p>A monocrystal is selected and mounted on the sample support by aligning the center of mass; setting collection parameters (temperature in the sample chamber, detector distance to sample, interval and degree of crystal rotation).</p>The crystals have a periodic molecular arrangement through a stack of identical planes in a crystal. These structural properties allow the analysis of crystals by X-ray diffraction. The distances between each crystalline plane correspond to the lattice distance.</p>The characteristics of the crystal are measured and calculated according to Bragg's law:</p>2d <sub>hk</sub> isinl <sub>vhk</sub> i = L, where</p>dhki represents the lattice distance, the indices designating the direction considered in the crystal,</p>L represents the wavelength of monochromatic radiation, and</p>- 2 ^ <sub>kI</sub> represents the angle between the incident ray and the diffracted ray.  The analysis of the collected data begins with the identification of intensity peaks, followed by the indexing of the diffraction spots. From this diffraction map, the information on the arrangement of the molecules in the crystal is determined and subsequently the basic structure of complex - elementary mesh. The parameters of the mesh are tested for the highest degree of symmetry. A list of possible space groups is given, then the one that gives the lowest error is chosen. This is how one learns the composition of the elementary mesh, the nature and the number of the molecules composing it.</p>Mesh data and unique reflections are imported into the WinGX software. The structure is solved, most of the time using Shelix program, by Direct Methods or Patterson. The structure is then refined, determining, step by step, the correspondence of the atoms in the structure to the molecules composing the crystal. This can be done using the Shelx97 program. Hydrogen atoms are the last to be identified because their intensity is lower than that of other atoms. Graphics programs, such as ORTEP, are often used to confirm the correct choice of atoms by evaluating the thermal factors for each atom.</p>The correctness of the refinement is given by the value of the factor R. The lower the value, the more accurate the structure is. All this work of refinement is done with files \". ins \"and\". res \", the existence of\""
