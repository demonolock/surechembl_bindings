    " than with known classical neuroleptic agents, e.g. haloperidol, which, as is known, bind to the D<sub>2</sub> or D<sub>3</sub> receptor. It has been established that in the case of schizophrenia the D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> receptor density increases by about 10%, while it increases by about 600% in the case of the D<sub>4</sub> receptor (TiPS, July 1994, vol. 15, p. 264-70).</p>Test Description</p>The compounds were characterized by a comparison in binding behaviour to the D4 receptor and to the D<sub>2</sub> receptor. CHO cells (Chinese Hamster Ovary) were used in the test. Crude membranes were isolated from D<sub>4</sub> --CHO and D<sub>2</sub> --CHO cells by ultracentrifugation and were stored at -80\u00b0 C. After thawing and homogenization in a buffer solution (50 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM KCI, 1.5 mM CaCI2, 4 mM MgCI<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4) they were incubated at room temperature for 90 minutes with 200 pM  <sup>3</sup> H!-spiperone and increasing concentrations (1\u00d710<sup>-11</sup> M to 1\u00d710<sup>-4</sup> M) of the test compound. A non-specific binding by the incubation was established in the presence of 1\u00d710<sup>-5</sup> M (+)-butaclamol.</p>The unbound radioligand was removed by filtration through a GFIC glass filter and the bound radioactivity was determined by flash emission in a Packard Top Count.</p>The following Table shows a comparison in the binding behaviour of the compounds in accordance with the invention to the D<sub>4</sub> receptor and D2 receptor.</p>The Ki value is a binding constant which shows the affinity of the compounds for the D<sub>4</sub> receptor. It was determined using <sup>3</sup> H-spiperone. The calculation of the value was effected with a ligand.</p>The 2nd column with activity data clearly shows the selectivity with respect to the D<sub>2</sub> receptor, expressed by the ratio of the Ki values at the D<sub>4</sub> receptor and at the D<sub>2</sub> receptor.</p>______________________________________                                    \nCompound/                                                                 \nExample       Ki at D.sub.4  uM!                                          \n                         Sel. vs. D.sub.2                                 \n______________________________________                                    \nA/5a          4          971                                              \nB/8b          16.4       903                                              \nC/19b         10         800                                              \nD/22a         15         750                                              \nE/24a         6          476                                              \nF/25a         8          940                                              \nG/32b         5          814                                              \nH/58c         7.3        663                                              \nI/59a         15         619                                              \nJ/82a         18         519                                              \nk/78b         3.8        1690                                             \nL/79a         5.2        1556                                             \nM/70b         13         764                                              \nN/46a         9          332                                              \nO/64b         18         533                                              \nP/71a         19         602                                              \nQ/73a         19         549                                              \nR/69a         ",
