    "ino acid sequence identity to amino acids 25-607 of the amino acid sequence depicted in FIG. 31 (SEQ ID NO:7).</p>In some embodiments, a suitable camel serum albumin protein comprises an amino acid sequence having at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about 98%, at least about 99%, or 100%, amino acid sequence identity to amino acids 25-607 of the amino acid sequence depicted in FIG. 32 (SEQ ID NO:8).</p>In some embodiments, a suitable camel albumin protein comprises an amino acid sequence having at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about 98%, at least about 99%, or 100%, amino acid sequence identity to amino acids 25-607 of the amino acid sequence depicted in FIG. 33 (SEQ ID NO:9).</p>The hydrophobic ligand of the present complex may be any suitable hydrophobic molecule that can bind to an albumin molecule while substantially maintaining desired properties of albumin molecule, e.g., solubility, binding ability to other albumin molecules and/or albumin receptors, etc. In some cases, a suitable hydrophobic molecule can bind to an albumin molecule without significantly altering the interaction with other albumin molecules that would in turn significantly alter aggregation of albumin in solution.</p>The hydrophobic molecule may have any suitable molecular weight to bind a hydrophobic binding site of albumin. In some cases, the hydrophobic molecule has a molecular weight of 100 kD or less, e.g., 50 kD or less, 20 kD or less, 10 kD or less, 5.0 kD or less, including 1.0 kD or less, and has a molecular weight of 0.05 kD or more, e.g., 0.1 kD or more, 0.2 kD or more, 0.3 kD or more, including 0.5 kD or more. In some embodiments, the hydrophobic molecule has a molecular weight in the range of 0.05 kD to 100 kD, e.g., 0.05 kD to 50 kD, 0.1 kD to 20 kD, including 0.1 kD to 10 kD. Binding of a hydrophobic molecule to albumin can be measured using any suitable method, such as those described herein, and by competition assays with known albumin binding agents (see, e.g., US 20150309040, which is incorporated herein by reference), or any other suitable method.</p>In some cases, the hydrophobic molecule includes a chromophore, e.g., a chromophore whose optical property is concentration-dependent due to an optical interaction between adjacent molecules in close proximity. The chromophore concentration-dependent optical property may be any suitable optical property for detecting a change in the aggregation status of the chromophore-containing molecule. In some cases, the absorbance of the chromophore is altered (e.g., red-shifted or blue shifted) in a concentration-dependent manner due to optical interactions between molecules that contain the chromophore. In some cases, the Raman scattering of the chromophore is altered (e.g., more or less efficient) in a concentration-dependent manner due to optical interactions between molecules that contain the chromophore.</p>Suitable chromophore-containing molecules include, but are not limited to, carotenoids. Carotenoids of interest include, but are not limited to, carotene (e.g., \u03b1-carotene, \u03b2-carotene, \u03b3-carotene, \u03b4-carotene, \u03b5-carotene, lycopene, etc.) and xanthophylls (e.g., lutein, zeaxanthin, neoxanthin, violaxanthin, flavoxanthin, \u03b1- and \u03b2-cryptoxanthin, etc.).</p>In some cases, suitable carotenoids are th"
