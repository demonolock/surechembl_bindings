It is a human TNF- \u03b1 derived peptide (. about.2 kD) consisting of 17 natural amino acids. The cyclic peptide was shown to activate ENaC by increasing its patency rate in heterologous expression systems. Pulmonary administration of the TIP peptide has been shown to substantially reduce lung permeability edema in a variety of pathophysiological conditions in a variety of small animal models of Acute Lung Injury (ALI). Amiloride sensitive Na + flux (via ENaC) was increased approximately 9-fold, 13-fold and 16-fold in rat, dog and pig AEC type II cells in the presence of AP301, respectively, over baseline conditions. AP301 is currently undergoing inhalation clinical trials.</p><p id=\"p0089\" num=\"0087\">The synthetic compound 2-guanidine-4-methyl quinazoline (GMQ) is another activator for ASIC (Stephan Kellenberger and Laurent Schild, supra primers):</p><p id=\"p0090\" num=\"0088\"></p><p id=\"p0091\" num=\"0089\">compound GMQ induced sustained ASIC3 currents and induced pain related behavior.</p><p id=\"p0092\" num=\"0090\">Injection of an ASIC activator, Mit-toxin (MitTx) of Dezhou coral snake venom, in the paw of mice, caused painful behavior, while destruction of ASIC1a resulted in a reduction in pain (Bohlen CJ et al, (2011), Nature 479: 410-.</p><p id=\"p0093\" num=\"0091\">Treatment of</p><p id=\"p0094\" num=\"0092\">Appetite is present in all higher life forms and is used to regulate sufficient energy intake to maintain metabolic needs.

Conventionally, new chemical entities with useful properties can be generated by identifying a test compound (referred to as a \"lead compound\") with some desired property or activity (e.g., inhibitory activity), followed by generating variants of the lead compound, and assessing the properties and activity of the variant compounds. Typically, High Throughput Screening (HTS) methods are used for this analysis. Typically, the test compounds may be small organic molecules and peptides. In one embodiment, the compound is an amiloride analog.</p><p id=\"p0129\" num=\"0127\">Determination test</p><p id=\"p0130\" num=\"0128\">Various assays, including in vitro and in vivo assays, including cell-based models, can be used to assess modulation of the activity or expression of DEG/ENaC proteins. See, e.g., U.S. patent 9244081 (describing screening methods for ENaC modulators) and U.S. patent application 20080242588 (describing screening methods for ASIC modulators). See also Andrew j.hirsh et al, j.med.chem.2006,49, 4098-; dube et al, Pain 117(2005) 88-96 (describing in vitro and in vivo characterization of ASIC blockers). These documents are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id=\"p0131\" num=\"0129\">The screening can involve any suitable assay system suitable for measuring the interaction between the DEG/ENaC protein and a candidate modulator (e.g., inhibitor). Exemplary assay test systems can include biochemical assays (e.g., binding assay tests) performed using, for example, cells grown in culture (\"cultured cells\") and/or using organisms.</p><p id=\"p0132\" num=\"0130\">In some embodiments, such assay assays for detecting modulators, e.g., inhibitors and activators, include, for example, expressing ENaC and/or ASIC proteins in cells, cell extracts, or cell membranes in vitro, applying putative modulator compounds, and then determining a functional effect on the activity of the proteins.</p><p id=\"p0133\" num=\"0131\">In some embodiments, a high throughput binding assay is performed in which the DEG/ENaC protein is contacted with a potential modulator and incubated for a suitable time. As noted above, a variety of modulators may be used, including small organic molecules, peptides, antibodies and DEG/ENaC ligand analogs.</p><p id=\"p0134\" num=\"0132\">A variety of assays are available for identifying the binding of DEG/ENaC to the modulator, including labeled protein-protein binding assays, electrophoretic mobility changes, immunoassay assays, enzymatic assays, such as phosphorylation assays, and the like. In some cases, binding of a candidate modulator is determined by using a competitive binding assay, wherein interference with binding of a known ligand is measured in the presence of a potential modulator. Ligands of the DEG/ENaC family are known. Further, amiloride is known to inhibit the function of ENaC and ASICs. In such assay assays, DEG/ENaC proteins such as ENaC and ASIC proteins can be first bound to known ligands and then the desired compound, i.e., a putative activator or inhibitor, added. After washing the DEG/ENaC protein, interference with binding of potential modulators or known ligands is determined. Typically, potential modulators or known ligands are labeled.</p><p id=\"p0135\" num=\"0133\">Methods for determining ion channel function include, for example, patch clamp techniques, two-electrode voltage clamping, whole cell current measurement, and fluorescence imaging techniques and ion flux determination assays using ion-sensitive fluorescent dyes, such as radiolabel ion flux determination or ion flux determination. In some embodiments, candidate compounds may be tested in short-circuit current (Isc) assays, for example in KJCoote et al, Br J pharmacol.2015jun; 172(11) 2814-26. In some embodiments, compounds that modulate ASIC activity can be tested in the presence of the composition and an acid in a whole cell patch clamp mode, as described, for example, in g.r. dube et al, Pain 117(2005) 88-96.</p><p id=\"p0136\" num=\"0134\">In some embodiments, a cell-based assay test system is used to measure the effect of each candidate modulator (e.g., inhibit"
