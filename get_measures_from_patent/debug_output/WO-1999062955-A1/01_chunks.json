    "t least one output device. Program code is applied to input data to perform the functions described above and generate output information. The output information is applied to one or more output devices, in known fashion. The computer may be, for example, a personal computer, microcomputer, or workstation of conventional design.</p>Each program is preferably implemented in a high level procedural or object-oriented programming language to communicate with a computer system. However, the programs can be implemented in assembly or machine language, if desired. In any case, the language may be compiled or interpreted language.</p>Each such computer program is preferably stored on a storage medium or device (e.g., ROM or magnetic diskette) readable by a general or special purpose programmable computer, for configuring and operating the computer when the storage media or device is read by the computer to perform the procedures described herein. The inventive system may also be considered to be implemented as a computer-readable storage medium, configured with a computer program, where the storage medium so configured causes a computer to operate in a specific and predefined manner to perform the functions described herein.</p>Compounds designed according to the methods of the present invention may be assessed by a number of in vitro and in vivo assays of hormone function. For example, the identification of EGF receptor antagonists of may be undertaken using a solid-phase receptor binding assay. Potential antagonists may be screened for their ability to inhibit the binding of europium-labelled EGF receptor ligands to soluble, recombinant EGF receptor in a microplate-based format. Europium is a lanthanide fluorophore, the presence of which can be measured using time-resolved fluorometry. The sensitivity of this assay matches that achieved by radioisotopes, \n\nmeasurement is rapid and is performed in a microplate format to allow high- sample throughput, and the approach is gaining wide acceptance as the method of choice in the development of screens for receptor agonists/antagonists ( see Apell et.al. J. Biomolec. Screening 3:19-27, 1998 : Inglese et. al. Biochemistry 37:2372-2377, 1998).</p>Binding affinity and inhibitor potency may be measured for candidate inhibitors using biosensor technology.</p>The EGF receptor antagonists may be tested for their ability to modulate receptor activity using a cell-based assay incorporating a stably transfected, EGF-responsive reporter gene (Souriau, C, Fort, P., Roux, P.,</p>Hartley, O., Lefranc, M-P., Weill, M., 1997, Nucleic Acids Res. 25:1585-1590). The assay addresses the ability of EGF to activate the reporter gene in the presence of novel ligands. It offers a rapid (results within 6-8 hours of hormone exposure), high-throughput (assay can be conducted in a 96-well format for automated counting) analysis using an extremely sensitive detection system (chemiluminescence). Once candidate compounds have been identif"
