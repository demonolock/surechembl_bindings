{"raw_mentions": "After analyzing the provided text snippet, I was unable to find any sentences that meet the specified criteria, which require the presence of a specific molecule name, ID, or other identifier, a bioactivity metric (IC50, Ki, Kd, EC50, and their variations), a specific numeric value for that metric, and a unit for that value. The text primarily discusses the interaction between VEGFR2 and SGLT1, their roles in cancer, and the effects of their inhibitors on various cancer cell lines, but it does not provide specific numeric values with units for bioactivity metrics like IC50, Ki, Kd, or EC50 for these molecules.\n\nTherefore, there are no sentences to list based on the given criteria."}
