    "derived from the foregoing data analysis of the present invention, in an embodiment, the present invention uses lentivirus to infect cells, and uses shRNA technology to knock down VEGFR2, SGLT1 and SGLT2 in liver cancer Hep3B cells respectively to verify the functional mutual influence between one another. ERK1/2 is a downstream molecule after activation of VEGFR2 tyrosine kinase activity. VEGFR2 activation will cause phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Giatromanolaki A, et al. Hypoxia and activated VEGF/receptor pathway in multiple myeloma. Anticancer Res. 2010; 30:2831-2836.). In an embodiment, the present invention evaluates the intensity of phosphorylated ERK1/2 after knockdown of VEGFR2, SGLT1 and SGLT2 to determine whether knockdown of SGLT1/2 affects the VEGFR2 signal. The results are shown in FIG. 4, knockdown of SGLT1 and of VEGFR2 will consistently induce the down-regulation of the intensity of phosphorylation of ERK1/2, while knockdown of SGLT2 has no such effect. If knockdown of SGLT1 causes damage to the VEGFR2 signaling pathway, the corresponding cells in which SGLT1 is knocked down will be more sensitive to the VEGFR2 inhibitor, just like cells in which VEGFR2 is knocked down. Taking the VEGFR2 inhibitor apatinib as an example only, the present invention is performed by placing the control cells and each cell line in which VEGFR2, SGLT1 or SGLT2 is knocked down on a 96-well plate, adding different concentrations of apatinib for the treatment of each group of cells. The IC50 values of apatinib on each group of cells are measured by MTT method. The results are shown in FIG. 5, knockdown of SGLT1 and of VEGFR2 consistently reduced the IC50 value of apatinib by more than half, while knockdown of SGLT2 had no such effect. It is well known that SGLT1 provides energy for cells to absorb glucose from the external environment against the glucose concentration gradient (Thorens B, Mueckler M. Glucose transporters in the 21<sup>st </sup>Century. Am J Physiol-Endoc M 2010;298:E141-5. doi:10.1152/ajpendo.00712.2009). Therefore, tumor cells in which SGLT1 is knocked down will preferentially die due to lack of glucose supply under low-glucose culture conditions. In an embodiment of the present invention, liver cancer Hep3B cells in which VEGFR2, SGLT1 or SGLT2 was knocked down were cultured using a low-glucose medium, and the cell status was observed at regular intervals under a light microscope. The results are shown in FIG. 6. Knockdown of VEGFR2 and that of SGLT1 consistently reduced the tolerance of cells to glucose starvation, while knockdown of SGLT2 had no significant effect. Based on the above, the present invention found for the first time that there is a functional mutual influence between the two molecules of VEGFR2 and SGLT1.</p>It is worth mentioning that the present invention only takes liver cancer Hep3B cells as an example to knock down each gene to evaluate their mutual influence, and the conclusions of the present invention should not be limited to this cancer type and cell line.</p>(3) There is an intermolecular interaction between VEGFR2 and SGLT1</p>Based on the functional mutual influence between",
    "alone or in admixture with the designated GFP-tagged VEGFR2 vector in serum-free DMEM medium with the transfection reagent PEI added. 6 hours after transfection, the medium was changed to 10% serum medium. 24 hours after changing the medium, the medium was discarded and the cells were washed with 10 ml of 1\u00d7 phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and then blowed up and centrifuged at 1500 rpm. The supernatant was discarded and RIPA buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with 150 mM sodium chloride, 1.0% Igepal CA-630(NP-40), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and 0.1% sodium dodecylsulfate) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture was added to the resultant cell pellet deposit and lysis was performed on a shaker at 4\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes. Then, the cell lysate was centrifuged at 12000\u00d7 rpm for 10 minutes. M2 microbeads coupled with Flag antibody were added to the supernatant and incubation was performed overnight at 4\u00b0 C. Then, the samples were centrifuged, washed three times with RIPA buffer, boiled in Laemmle buffer (Biorad, CA), and western blot analysis was preformed using 8% SDS PAGE gel. IP=immunoprecipitation, IB=immunoblotting, and Input=the expression level of the specified foreign protein in the HEK293 whole cell lysate used for immunoprecipitation. The result is shown in FIG. 7.</p>(4) Inhibition of SGLT1 by the SGLT1 inhibitor makes liver cancer or colorectal adenocarcinoma cells sensitive to the VEGFR2 inhibitor.</p>FIGS. 8 and 9 only demonstrate illustratively the evaluation of the IC50 values of the VEGFR2 inhibitor apatinib and the SGLT1 inhibitor sotagliflozin used as either single agents or a composition thereof in the liver cancer HepG2 cell line, the colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line SW620, and 5 other common cancer cell lines. Based on these results, in one embodiment, co-inhibition of SGLT1 and VEGFR2 function can more effectively inhibit the growth of cancer cells. In another embodiment, an SGLT1 inhibitor, such as sotagliflozin, can significantly allow the transplanted tumor of the liver cancer cell line Hep3B in nude mice sensitive to the growth inhibitory effect of apatinib, as shown in FIG. 10. In an embodiment, SGLT1 inhibitor compounds such as sotagliflozin can be administered intravenously or orally to patients to treat cancer. In another embodiment, SGLT1 inhibitor compounds such as sotagliflozin can be administered to patients together with a VEGFR2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor to treat cancer.</p>The reagents or instruments used in the composition for treating cancer and the use and medicament thereof provided by the present invention can be purchased from the market.</p>The present invention will be further illustrated in combination with the following examples.</p>Example 11.
