    "cording to the procedure described below.</p>The Neuro-2A cell line comes from a standard commercial source (ATCC). The Neuro-2A clone was obtained from a spontaneous tumor from an albino mouse A strain by RJ Klebe et al. This Neuro-2A line is then stably transfected with 8NBRE-luciferase. The N2A-8NBRE cells are cultured to confluence in 75 cm <sup>2</sup> culture flasks containing DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 4.5 g / l glucose and 0.4 mg / ml Geneticin. . After one week of culture, the cells are recovered with 0.25% trypsin for 30 seconds and then resuspended in DMEM without phenol red containing 4.5 g / l of glucose, 10% of delipidated serum Hyclone and deposited in 96-well white plates with transparent bottom. The cells are deposited at a rate of 60,000 per well in 75 \u03bcL for 24 hours before the addition of the products. The products are applied in 25 \u03bcl and incubated for a further 24 hours. On the day of the measurement, an equivalent volume (100 \u03bcL) of Steadylite is added to each well, then waited for 30 minutes to obtain a complete lysis of the cells and the maximum production of the signal. The plates are then measured in a microplate luminescence counter after being sealed with an adhesive film. The products are prepared as a stock solution at 10 <sup>-2</sup> M, then diluted in 100% DMSO. Each product concentration is previously diluted in culture medium before incubation with the cells thus containing 0.625% final DMSO.</p>The best compounds have an EC50 of between 0.1 nM and 10 \u03bcM.</p>For example, compound # 2 showed an EC50 of 3 nM.</p>It therefore appears that the compounds according to the invention have a modulating effect of NOT.</p>The compounds according to the invention can therefore be used for the preparation of medicaments for their therapeutic application in the treatment or prevention of diseases involving NOT receptors.</p>Thus, according to another of its aspects, the subject of the invention is medicaments which comprise a compound of formula (I), or an addition salt thereof to a pharmaceutically acceptable acid.</p>These drugs find their therapeutic use, especially in the treatment and prevention of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, tauopathies (eg, supranuclear progressive paralysis, fronto-temporal dementia, corticobasal degeneration). Pick's disease); brain trauma such as ischemia and head trauma and epilepsy; psychiatric diseases  such as schizophrenia, depression, substance dependence, attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity disorder; inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system such as multiple sclerosis, encephalitis, myelitis and encephalomyelitis and other inflammatory diseases such as vascular diseases, atherosclerosis, inflammation of the joints, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis; osteoarthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis; allergic inflammatory diseases such as asthma, autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes, lupus, scleroderma, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, Addison's disease and other immuno-mediated dise"
