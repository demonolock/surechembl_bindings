This present invention discloses that the synthesis was carried out at pH=ll (adjusted by NaOH) using the NaBH4 as a reducing agent. </p>The fluorescent bimetallic nanocomposites (NCs) of silver-gold (Ag@Au-NC) and silver-platinum (Ag@Pt-NC) was synthesized by reducing silver nitrate (AgNO<sub>3</sub>) on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) using sodium borohydride (NaBH<sub>4</sub>) at alkaline pH=ll, in presence of lysozyme that acts as a template, capping and stabilizing agent (Fig. 18). A indicates the lysozyme protein; B indicates the silver (Ag) layer; C indicates the gold (Au) [for Ag@Au NC]/ platinum (Pt) [for Ag@Pt NC] core. \n\nThe overall schematic diagram for the whole invention is presented in Fig. 19.

    "al organs, histopathological examination was carried out after sacrifice of mice. We collected the vital organs (brain, liver, heart, kidney, lung and spleen) of the untreated and treated mice Ag@ Au NC and Ag@Pt NC. The histological appearances of the liver, spleen, kidney, brain, heart, and lung were observed after haematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E) stain. Further, the tissues were fixed with 10% formalin, subjected to standard tissue processing and were embedded in paraffin blocks. Thereafter, they were sectioned at a thickness of 5 pm and mounted on the glass slides. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E) staining was performed according to the literature. Bright-field images were acquired using a microscope. The mice treated with both the NCs showed no significant toxicity to the tissue such as inflammation, vascular changes or depletion fibrosis etc (Fig.10). </p>EXAMPLE 19 </p>Immunofluorescence studies: Prior to immunostaning the tumor tissue slides were dipped into isopropanol followed by xylene for 3 minutes each and antigen retrieval was carried out by heating section in sub-boiling condition in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH= 6) for 10 minutes. Tissue sections were \n\nwashed locally with mili-Q water three times after cooling the slides at room temperature. After that, blocking was performed with 3% BSA solution in lx TBST for 1 h at room temperature. Then the sections were washed for three times with lx TBST for about five minutes each. Sections were then incubated in primary antibody (Ki-67) at 4 \u00b0C overnight. The sections were washed with lx TBST followed by addition of secondary antibody and incubation for half an hour at room temperature. Finally, after washing the sections with lx TBST, they were mounted with DAPI fluoroshield. The images were captured using fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse: TE 2000-E, Japan) at 20 X magnification. Result reveal that Ag@Au and Ag@Pt NCs treated tumor tissues show suppressed red fluorescence compared to untreated, treated tissue sections (Fig.11). The anti-tumor activities of both the NCs are clearly proved by the decrease in expression of Ki-67 in cells. </p>EXAMPLE 20 </p>TUNEL assay [Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP Nick-End Labeling]: It is one of the assays to determine the apoptosis in cells caused by DNA damage. Ag@Au and Ag@PtNCs treated and untreated tumor tissues were stained using a commercial TUNEL assay k (BD Biosciences) following the manufacturers\u2019 protocol. Finally, images were captured using fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse: TE 2000-E, Japan) at 20 X magnification. TUNEL positivity (green fluorescence comes due to FITC) is highly detectable in tumors sections of mice treated with Ag@Au and Ag@Pt NCs. The cell nucleus was stained with DAPI, which show blue fluorescence (Fig.12). It is evident from the result that Ag@Au and Ag@Pt NCs are more efficient for tumor therapy by an effective suppression of tumor growth. </p>EXAMPLE 21 </p>Spectro-fluorimetry study: Nanocomposite exhibits high fluorescence which is very useful for their different applications. The actual reason for their fluorescence is still unknown. Recent studies indicating the ligand to metal charge transfer and quantum confinement in the metal core are one of major reasons. If a nanoparticle or ligand is present in a close proximity to any plasmonic metal nanoparticle (gold, platinum etc.), owing to the coupling of nanoparticles surface plasmon with oscillating electrons system, enhancement of fluorescence emission intensity occurs. Eventually, the fluorescence of Ag@Au and Ag@Pt NCs are coming due to this pla"
