    "/patcit>.</p>PLK4 has been reported to be overexpressed in colorectal tumors with expression reported as low in adjacent normal intestinal mucosa (Macmillian et al. Ann. Surg. Oncol. 8: 729-740, 2001). In addition, PLK4 mRNA has been reported to be overexpressed in some tumor cell lines (Hitoshi, et al., U.S. Patent Application No. US 2003/0027756</patcit>). In addition, Applicants described overexpression of PLK4 in basal-like tumors in a co-pending U.S. Provisional Application No. 61,003,825, filed on November 20, 2007</patcit>.</p>The human papillomavirus (HPV-16) E7 oncoproteins are overexpressed in HPV-associated anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers. The E7 oncoprotein triggers centrosome overduplication through a pathway that involves the concurrent formation of multiple daughters at single maternal centrioles. The HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein has been used as a tool to dissect abnormal centriole biogenesis and several lines of evidence identify PLK4 as a crucial player in this process (Duensing et al Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 50: 741-747, 2009). In addition, an increased level of PLK4 transcription is found in keratinocytes stably expressing HPV-16 E7. The ability of HPV-16 E7 to upregulate PLK4 mRNA was found to depend on its ability to degrade the retinoblastoma (pRb) protein, suggesting a role of E2F-mediated gene transcription in deregulation of PLK4 (Korzeniewski et al, AACR Meeting, Washington, 2010, Abstr. 5354). These results identify PLK4 as a target for small molecule inhibition to prevent centriole abnormalities, mitotic infidelity and malignant progression in HPV-associated cancers.</p>Therefore, agents which inhibit a protein kinase, in particular PLK4, have the potential to treat cancer. There is a need for additional agents which can act as protein kinase inhibitors, in particular PLK4 inhibitors.</p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONApplicants have now discovered that certain spiro cyclopropyl indolinone compounds are potent kinase inhibitors, such as polo-like kinases 4 (PLK4) and Aurora Kinases (see Example B and F). Applicants have also now discovered that these spiro cyclopropyl indolinone compounds have potent anticancer activity (see Example J) and exhibit anti-angiogenic activity (example K). Based on these discoveries, spiro cyclopropyl indolinone compounds, pharmaceutical compositions thereof, and methods of treating cancer with the spiro cyclopropyl indolinone compounds are disclosed herein.</p>The claimed subject-matter is defined by the appended claims.
