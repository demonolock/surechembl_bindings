The antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof can specifically bind to a complement protein. The complement protein can be, for example, complement protein 3d (c3d). In some cases, a molecule of the complement modulator polypeptide can comprise at least a biologically active fragment of a complement protein. The complement protein can be, for example, CR1. DAF. MCP. Crry. MAp44, MAp19. CD59, or factor H. In some cases, the fusion protein construct has a lower half-maximal inhibitory concentration (based on for example a complement assay) compared to that of a comparator protein construct that does not comprise the antibody but is otherwise identical. In some cases, a molecule of the complement modulator polypeptide can be conjugated to a heavy chain of the antibody or the antigen binding fragment thereof. In some cases, a molecule of the complement modulator polypeptide can be conjugated to a light chain of the antibody or the antigen binding fragment thereof. In some cases, a molecule of the complement modulator polypeptide is conjugated to the C terminus of the heavy chain and/or the light chain. In some cases, a molecule of the complement modulator polypeptide is conjugated to the N terminus of the heavy chain and/or the light chain.</p>This disclosure provides a fusion protein construct comprising an antibody or an antigen binding fragment thereof that specifically binds to a complement-associated antigen, and a first molecule and a second molecule of a complement modulator polypeptide. In some case, the antibody can comprise a first polypeptide and a second polypeptide. In some cases, the first polypeptide and the second polypeptide can each comprise a heavy chain, and a light chain. In some cases, the first molecule and the second molecule can each comprise a biologically active fragment of a complement protein. The complement protein can be CR1, DAF, MCP, Crry, MAp44, MAp19, CD59, or factor H. In some cases, an albumin to c",
    "g fragment thereof, that specifically binds to a phospholipid, can be a C2 mAb, or an antigen binding fragment derived from the C2 mAb, described in Elvington et al., J Immunol., 188(3): 1460-1468 (2012). Exemplary CDRs of C2 mAb are provided in SEQ ID NOS: 17-22. C2 mAb recognizes a subset of phospholipids that are exposed after complement activation or ischemia; this subset of phospholipids is referred to herein as \u201cC2 antibody-reactive phospholipids.\u201d C2 mAb has been shown to recognize a subset of phospholipids that included phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin, but not phosphatidylglycerol or phosphatidylserine.</p>The targeting moiety, in some cases, can be an antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof, which specifically binds to deposited or opsonized C3 fragments, e.g., C3b, iC3b, C3d or C3dg, but may or may not bind to free or circulating or undeposited C3 fragments, e.g., C3a, C3b, C3c or C3f. In some examples, it is possible for fusion protein constructs comprising an anti-C3d or anti-C3dg antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof to bind with relatively higher affinity to deposited C3 fragments compared to free C3 or C3 fragments. For example, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof can bind C3 and C3b with about 5-fold, about 6-fold, about 7-fold, about 8-fold, about 9-fold, or about 10-fold lower binding affinity compared to C3d. In some embodiments, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment binds C3 and/or C3b with a KD of 10<sup>\u22124</sup>M or higher, 10<sup>\u22123</sup>M, or higher, or 10<sup>\u22122</sup>M or higher, and binds iC3b, C3dg, or both, with a binding affinity (KD) of 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M or less, 10<sup>\u22129</sup>M or less, or 10-10 M or less.</p>In some examples, it is possible for fusion protein constructs comprising an anti-C3d or anti-C3dg antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof to bind to deposited C3 fragments as well as free C3 or C3 fragments. It is further possible that the anti-C3d or anti-C3dg antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof, of an exemplary fusion protein construct, can bind to complement fragment C3d and have the ability to discriminate between tissue bound C3 fragments from circulating C3 (e.g., C3, C3b, or C3(H<sub>2</sub>O). Examples of the anti-C3d or anti-C3dg antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof include, but are not limited to, mAbs 3d9a, 3d29 and 3d8b (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 9,815,890). In some instances, the anti-C3d or anti-C3dg antibodies of this disclosure can bind to C3d with greater specificity than commercially available anti-C3d antibodies, such as, for example, anti-C3d antibodies designated by the Quidel catalog numbers A207 and A250, that are commercially available from the Quidel Corporation (Quidel Corp., San Diego and Santa Clara, Calif.). In some cases, the targeting moiety can comprise an antibody specific to C3d and/or other C3 fragments (C3b, iC3b, C3c, C3dg, etc.), such as an antibody C8D3 as described in US Patent Application Publication No. 2016/0333082. The antibody C8D3 can bind to an epitope on C3d with high affinity (see, e.g., FIGS. 3 and 8 of US 2016/033",

A 25 mM EDTA solution in dPBS (EDTA-PBS) was prepared by adding 400 \u03bcL of 0.5 M EDTA into 7.6 mL of dPBS (1:20).</p>In order to terminate the complement activity, 100 \u03bcL of EDTA-H2O was added to the water controls, whereas 100 \u03bcL of EDTA-PBS was added to the remaining wells. The plate was spun at 1800 rpm for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0. 100 \u03bcL of the well volume was transferred to a new microplate and was measured at 415 nm (SpectraFluorPlus, Tecan).

    "50 \u03bcL of Cardiolipin (Sigma) in coating buffer (100% ethanol) (Sigma). Plates were incubated overnight while loosely covered (USA Scientific) to enable evaporation of ethanol. Coated plates were blocked with 300 \u03bcL of Echelon custom blocking buffer (Echelon) and incubated for at least 2 hours at room temperature. Wells were aspirated and 100 \u03bcL of diluted sample in Echelon custom buffer was added to each well. Wells were incubated for at least 90 minutes at room temperature. Plates were washed three times with PBS and dried on paper towels. 100 \u03bcL of PBS-diluted secondary antibodies were added to the appropriate wells. For detections of C2-IgM, goat anti-mouse IgM (Southern Biotech) was diluted at 1:5,000. For detection of C2 IgG1 (murine), rabbit anti-mouse light chain kappa (Abcam) was diluted at 1:10,000. For detection of C2-IgG1 (human), mouse anti-human pFc\u2032 (Abcam) was diluted at 1:20,000. For detection of C2 fragments with a His<sub>6 </sub>epitope tag (SEQ ID NO: 296), goat anti-6\u00d7His (Abcam) was diluted at 1:5,000. After addition and incubation of secondary antibodies, plates were washed three times with PBS. Plates were developed by addition of 100 \u03bcL of BioFx Supersensitive TMB (Surmodics). Plates were incubated in the dark for 15 minutes. The reactions were terminated by addition of 100 \u03bcL of stop solution (Surmodics) and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm.</p>Table 23 shows EC<sub>50 </sub>values obtained for the C2 constructs assayed in the cardiolipin ELISA binding assay.
