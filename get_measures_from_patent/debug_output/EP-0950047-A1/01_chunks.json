    " and  are powerful ligands for vasopressin and / or oxytocin receptors.</p>The affinity of the compounds according to the invention for the vasopressin Vi receptors was determined in vitro using the method described in Lynch C.J. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1985, 260 (5), 2844-2851. This method consists in studying the displacement of tritiated vasopressin attached to the Vi sites of rat liver membranes.</p>Likewise, the affinity of the compounds (I) according to the invention for the oxytocin receptors was determined in vitro by displacement of a radioiodinated oxytocin analog attached to the receptors of a membrane preparation of mammary glands of pregnant rats, using a technique similar to that described by Elands J. et al., in Eur. J. Pharmacol., 1987, 147, 197-207. Certain compounds according to the invention inhibit the binding of an analogue of radioiodinated oxytocin to the receptors of membrane preparations. Their IC <sub>50</sub> are low, varying from 10 <sup>\"6</sup> to 10 <sup>_9</sup> M.</p>The affinity of the compounds (I) according to the invention for the V <sub>2</sub> receptors was measured on a membrane preparation of beef kidney according to a method adapted from Crause P. et al., Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology, 1982, 28, 529 -541 and de Stassen FL et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 1982, 233, 50-54. The compounds according to the invention inhibit the binding of tritiated arginine vasopressin to the V <sub>2</sub> receptors of membrane preparations. The IC 50 values of the compounds according to the invention are low: they vary from 5.10 <sup>\"7</sup> to 10 <sup>\" 9</sup> M.</p>The agonist or antagonist activity of the vasopressin receptors of the compounds according to the invention, administered orally, was evaluated in the normally hydrated rat (strain Sprague-Dawley) according to the technique described in Br. J. Pharmacol., 1992 , 105, 787-791.</p>The diuretic effect, generally observed for the compounds of formula (I) and, for some of these compounds, at doses less than or equal to 10 mg / kg, shows that the compounds of formula (I) constitute a series of powerful V <sub>2</sub> antagonists.</p>The compounds according to the invention are active after administration by various routes, in particular by oral route.</p>No signs of toxicity are observed with these compounds at pharmacologically active doses and their toxicity is therefore compatible with their medical use as medicaments.</p>The compounds according to the present invention make it possible either to mimic or to selectively inhibit the effects of vasopressin and / or oxytocin. Among these  compounds vasopressin receptor antagonists can intervene in the regulation of central and peripheral circulation, in particular coronary, renal and gastric circulation, as well as in water regulation and the release of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). Vasopressin agonists can advantageously replace vasopressin or its analogues in the treatment of diabetes insipidus; th"
