The cloned recombinant antibody derived from Clone 19 is referred to herein as antibody CA051<sub>\u2014</sub>00949 also referred to herein as 949.</p>The residues in antibody variable domains are conventionally numbered according to a system devised by Kabat et al. This system is set forth in Kabat et al., 1987, in Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, US Department of Health and Human Services, NIH, USA (hereafter \u201cKabat et al. (supra)\u201d). This numbering system is used in the present specification except where otherwise indicated.</p>The Kabat residue designations do not always correspond directly with the linear numbering of the amino acid residues. The actual linear amino acid sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids than in the strict Kabat numbering corresponding to a shortening of, or insertion into, a structural component, whether framework or complementarity determining region (CDR), of the basic variable domain structure. The correct Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given antibody by alignment of residues of homolog",
    "olypeptide may be obtained, where immunisation of an animal is necessary, by administering the polypeptides to an animal, preferably a non-human animal, using well-known and routine protocols, see for example Handbook of Experimental Immunology, D. M. Weir (ed.), Vol 4, Blackwell Scientific Publishers, Oxford, England, 1986). Many warm-blooded animals, such as rabbits, mice, rats, sheep, cows, camels or pigs may be immunized. However, mice, rabbits, pigs and rats are generally most suitable.</p>Monoclonal antibodies may be prepared by any method known in the art such as the hybridoma technique (Kohler &amp; Milstein, 1975, Nature, 256:495-497), the trioma technique, the human B-cell hybridoma technique (Kozbor et al., 1983, Immunology Today, 4:72) and the EBV-hybridoma technique (Cole et al., Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, pp 77-96, Alan R Liss, Inc., 1985).</p>Antibodies for use in the invention may also be generated using single lymphocyte antibody methods by cloning and expressing immunoglobulin variable region cDNAs generated from single lymphocytes selected for the production of specific antibodies by, for example, the methods described by Babcook, J. et al., 1996, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93(15):7843-78481; WO92/02551; WO2004/051268 and International Patent Application number WO2004/106377.</p>Screening for antibodies can be performed using assays to measure binding to human PD-1 and/or assays to measure the ability to agonise PD1 activity. An example of a binding assay is an ELISA, in particular, using a fusion protein of human PD-1 and human Fc, which is immobilized on plates, and employing a conjungated secondary antibody to detect anti-PD-1 antibody bound to the fusion protein. Examples of suitable agonism and ligand blocking assays are described in the Examples herein.</p>Humanised antibodies (which include CDR-grafted antibodies) are antibody molecules having one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from a non-human species and a framework region from a human immunoglobulin molecule (see, e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089; WO91/09967). It will be appreciated that it may only be necessary to transfer the specificity determining residues of the CDRs rather than the entire CDR (see for example, Kashmiri et al., 2005, Methods, 36, 25-34). Humanised antibodies may optionally further comprise one or more framework residues derived from the non-human species from which the CDRs were derived.</p>The present invention provides agonistic humanised antibodies having specificity for human PD-1.</p>An agonistic murine anti-PD-1 antibody (Clone 19) was described in PCT/IB2009/06940 (unpublished) and the sequences of the variable regions and CDRs of this antibody are provided in FIG. 1. In particular the CDRs of this antibody are provided in FIG. 1(c), SEQ ID NOs 1-6.</p>An improved version of the CDRL3 (SEQ ID NO:6) derived from Clone 19 is provided in FIG. 2 (a) (SEQ ID NO:7) in which a potential deamidation site has been mod",

This cell line is a hybrid between BALB/c spleen cells and the myeloma cell line P3x63Ag8. The cells have been described as not synthesizing or secreting immunoglobulin chains, being resistant to 8-azaguanine at 20 \u03bcg/ml, and not growing in HAT (Hypoxanthine, Aminopterin, Thymidine) medium. The SP2/0 cells are routinely maintained in tissue culture flasks in standard growth medium (with 10% FCS). A new aliquot of frozen SP2/0 cells was used after a period of 2 weeks in order to avoid the implementation of HGPRT-positive revertants. The myeloma cells were shown to be negative in all mycoplasma tests.</p>1.2 Antigens for Immunization and Screening</p>The recombinant protein PD-1Fc was prepared using the methods described for the production of CD28Fc (Evans et al. Nat Immunol. 6, 271-9 (2005)) and concentrated to 5.1 m",
    "itration of the human PD-1 over the captured surface.</p>BIA (Biamolecular Interaction Analysis) was performed using a BIAcore 3000 (BIAcore AB). Affinipure F(ab\u2032)<sub>2 </sub>Fragment, goat anti-human IgG, Fc fragment specific (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was immobilised on a CM5 Sensor Chip via amine coupling chemistry to a capture level of \u22486000 response units (RUs). A blank surface was prepared in a similar way, omitting the Fc fragment from the procedure. HBS-EP buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% Surfactant P20, BIAcore AB) was used as the running buffer with a flow rate of 10 \u03bcl/min. A 10 \u03bcl injection of 949 IgG at \u02dc1 \u03bcg/mL was used to give \u02dc200RU capture by the immobilised anti-human IgG-Fc. Human PD-1 was titrated over the captured 949 or humanised variants at various concentrations (50 nM or below) at a flow rate of 30 \u03bcL/min. The surface was regenerated by a 10 \u03bcL injection of 40 mM HCl, followed by a 5 \u03bcL injection of 5 mM NaOH at a flowrate of 10 \u03bcL/min.</p>Background subtraction binding curves were analysed using the BIAevaluation software (version 3.2) following standard procedures. Kinetic parameters were determined from the fitting algorithm.</p>Data for 949 and the various humanised versions are shown in Table 1. For all grafts tested except for 1, (VK1 gL11gH1a) affinity for PD-1 was improved compared to the 949 parental antibody. The chimeric contained the 949 variable regions with human IgG4 constant domains.</p>TABLE 1Antibodyka (1/Ms)kd (1/s)KD (nM)949 parental2.66E+051.35E\u2212035.07949 chimeric1.95E+051.17E\u2212035.98949 VK1gL1 gH1a2.11E+057.82E\u2212043.71949 VK1 gL1 gH1b1.91E+055.56E\u2212042.92949 VK1 gL11 gH1a2.07E+051.15E\u2212035.54949 VK1 gL9 gH8a2.45E+055.74E\u2212042.35949 VK1 gL9 gH20a2.30E+057.27E\u2212043.17949 VK1 gL9 gH8b2.27E+055.32E\u2212042.34949 VK1 gL9 gH20b2.47E+056.58E\u2212042.66949 VK1 gL12 gH8a2.34E+055.74E\u2212042.46949 VK1 gL12 gH20a2.26E+057.66E\u2212043.38949 VK1 gL12 gH8b2.22E+056.14E\u2212042.77949 VK1 gL12 gH20b2.20E+058.35E\u2212043.80949 VK1 gL14 gH8a2.09E+059.92E\u2212044.75949 VK1 gL14 gH8b2.03E+058.88E\u2212044.38949 VK3 gL1 gH1a2.10E+058.44E\u2212044.02949 VK3 gL1 gH1b2.07E+056.50E\u2212043.14949 VK3 gL11 gH1a2.23E+051.09E\u2212034.89949 VK1 gL15 Gh22.37E+058.56E\u2212043.61</p>4.2 Analysis of Ligand Blocking Activity of Antibody 949 and Humanised Versions of 949</p>PD-1 ligand binding assays were performed to determine if antibody 949 (chimeric human IgG4 (parental V region), and humanised transient clones of 949) had the capacity to block ligand binding. In these assays PD-1 expressing HEK cells were incubated with purified or transiently expressed antibody supernatants for 30 minutes, followed by incubation with recombinant human PD-L2.mFc fusion protein. Binding of the PD-L2.mFc to cell expressed PD-1 was then revealed with a PE-conjugated anti-mouse IgG H+L antibody.</p>Method</p>HEK293 cells were transiently transfected by culturing at 5\u00d710<sup>6</sup>/well with 5 \u03bcg human PD-1 DNA and 293 fectin (Invitrogen) overnight in 6 well plates.

    "1 agonism. The assay was used to compare the functional agonistic activity of the parental murine antibody 949 with a range of humanised constructs.</p>The human PD-1/CD28/TCR\u03b6 chimera construct was generated according to the methods described in International Application WO 2007/060406. Jurkat cells were stably transfected with the human PD-1/CD28/TCR\u03b6 chimera in the SEAP reporter vector. Cells were prepared in bulk and stored in liquid nitrogen until used. Cells were thawed and dispensed in 15 \u03bcL aliquots of medium containing 30,000 cells per 384 well. The antibody/construct was prepared at 4\u00d7 final concentration in NM6 medium, and a 5 \u03bcL volume added to duplicate wells. After 18 hours incubation, 4 \u03bcL of supernatant was assayed for SEAP activity as described in the pack leaflet (Clontech, Great Escape\u2122 SEAP). Activity was calculated as fold induction (signal divided by background signal).</p>The data in FIG. 15 shows antibody 949 stimulated release of SEAP from the Jurkat human PD-1/CD28/TCR\u03b6 SEAP reporter cell line. The control human antibody, CAN-1, did not stimulate release of SEAP. The original CA949 construct, cLcH, and the construct VK1 gL12 gH8b produced similar titrations in the assay. Table 2 indicates that all the humanised constructs tested generated a SEAP response in this assay, demonstrating that they have maintained their agonistic function after humanisation.</p>TABLE 2Comparison of humanised versions of 949 in the human PD-1/CD28/TCR\u03b6 SEAP reporter assay.

HEK293 cells were transiently transfected by culturing at 5\u00d710<sup>6</sup>/well with 5 \u03bcg DNA and 293 fectin (Invitrogen) overnight in 6 well plates. The following day human, cynomolgus or rhesus PD-1 expressing HEK293 cells were resuspended in 0.2% BSA (w/v) PBS+0.09% sodium azide and incubated for 1 hr at 4\u00b0 C. with stated concentrations of 949 chimeric, 949 humanised grafts, 949 chimeric (purified) or control antibodies. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with secondary antibody\u20141:1000 FITC (Fab)2 Goat anti Human Fc specific (109-006-098 Jackson) for 1 hr at 4\u00b0 C. Analyses were performed on a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson).</p>The results are shown in FIG. 16. They indicate that i) all the grafts bind specifically to PD-1 expressing cells (FIG. 16a, d), ii) they all retain human PD-1 binding equivalent to the original sequence (FIG. 16a) and iii) they all cross-react with PD-1 from cynomolgus (FIG. 16b) and rhesus (FIG. 16c) monkeys.</p>4.5 Ligand Blocking Assay</p>PD-1 transfect HEK293 cells with test antibody for 30 minutes on ice.
