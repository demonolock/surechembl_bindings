    "This application is a divisional application of U.S. application Ser. No. 08/878,862, filed Jun. 19, 1997.</p>FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of a new human lysophospholipase and to the use of these sequences in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of inflammation and disorders associated with immune response and cell proliferation.</p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONLysophospholipase (LPL) is a widely distributed enzyme which regulates intracellular lipids and occurs in numerous isoforms. These isoforms vary in molecular mass, substrate metabolized, and optimum pH required for activity. Small isoforms, approximately 15-30 kD, function as hydrolases; large isoforms, those exceeding 60 kD function both as transacylases and hydrolases. LPLs are regulated by lipid factors such as acylcarnitine, arachidonic acid and phosphatidic acid.</p>Sugimoto, H. et al. (1996; J. Biol. Chem. 271:7705-11) isolated a monomeric, 24 kD LPL from rat liver which hydrolyzed lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylethanol-amine, lysophosphatidylinositol, lysophosphatidylserine, and 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine at pH 6-8.0. In an assay measuring LPL hydrolysis of 1-palmitoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine, the substrate dependence curve was sigmoidal, the enzyme was active from pH 5.5-9.0, and activity was not affected by Ca<sup>2</sup> +, Mg<sup>2</sup> +, or EDTA. Km and Vmax were calculated to be 0.17 mM and 1.55 \u03bcM/min/mg, respectively.</p>The cDNA for rat liver LPL was isolated, and the deduced amino acid sequence showed a conserved GXSXG motif and similarity to esterases from Pseudomonas fluorescence and Spirulina platensis. Transcripts encoding rat liver LPL were isolated from spleen, heart, brain, lung, stomach, testis, and liver. Experiments showed that DMSO treatment of an HL-60 (myelocytic leukemia) cell line induced granulocyte differentiation, produced a 3-fold increase in the amount of enzyme, and correlated with the release of arachidonic acid.</p>The role of LPLs in human tissues has been investigated in various research studies. Selle, H. et al. (1993; Eur. J. Biochem. 212:411-16) characterized the role of LPL in the hydrolysis of lysophosphatidylcholine which causes lysis in erythrocyte membranes. Similarly, Endresen, M. J. et al. (1993) Scand. J. Clin. Invest. 53:733-9) reported that the increased hydrolysis of lysophosphatidylcholine by LPL in pre-eclamptic women causes release",
    "roduce the consensus sequence.</p>The term \"correlates with expression of a polynucleotide\", as used herein, indicates that the detection of the presence of ribonucleic acid that is similar to SEQ ID NO:2 by northern analysis is indicative of the presence of mRNA encoding IHLP in a sample and thereby correlates with expression of the transcript from the polynucleotide encoding the protein.</p>A \"deletion\", as used herein, refers to a change in the amino acid or nucleotide sequence and results in the absence of one or more amino acid residues or nucleotides.</p>The term \"derivative\", as used herein, refers to the chemical modification of a nucleic acid encoding or complementary to IHLP or the encoded IHLP. Such modifications include, for example, replacement of hydrogen by an alkyl, acyl, or amino group. A nucleic acid derivative encodes a polypeptide which retains the biological or immunological function of the natural molecule. A derivative polypeptide is one which is modified by glycosylation, pegylation, or any similar process which retains the biological or immunological function of the polypeptide from which it was derived.</p>The term \"homology\", as used herein, refers to a degree of complementarity. There may be partial homology or complete homology (i.e., identity). A partially complementary sequence that at least partially inhibits an identical sequence from hybridizing to a target nucleic acid is referred to using the functional term \"substantially homologous.\" The inhibition of hybridization of the completely complementary sequence to the target sequence may be examined using a hybridization assay (Southern or northern blot, solution hybridization and the like) under conditions of low stringency. A substantially homologous sequence or hybridization probe will compete for and inhibit the binding of a completely homologous sequence to the target sequence under conditions of low stringency. This is not to say that conditions of low stringency are such that non-specific binding is permitted; low stringency conditions require that the binding of two sequences to one another be a specific (i.e., selective) interaction. The absence of non-specific binding may be tested by the use of a second target sequence which lacks even a partial degree of complementarity (e.g., less than about 30% identity). In the absence of non-specific binding, the probe will not hybridize to the second non-complementary target sequence.</p>Human artificial chromosomes (HACs) are linear microchromosomes which may contain DNA sequences of 10K to 10M in size and contain all of the elements required for stable mitotic chromosome segregation and maintenance (Harrington, J. J. et al. (1997) Nat Genet. 15:345-355).</p>The term \"humanized antibody\", as used herein, refers to antibody molecules in which amino acids have been replaced in the non-antigen binding regions in order to more closely resemble a human antibody, while still retaining the original binding ability.</p>Th",
    "placed in tandem with a sequence encoding IHLP under the control of a single promoter. Expression of the marker gene in response to induction or selection usually indicates expression of the tandem gene as well.</p>Alternatively, host cells which contain the nucleic acid sequence encoding IHLP and express IHLP may be identified by a variety of procedures known to those of skill in the art. These procedures include, but are not limited to, DNA-DNA or DNA-RNA hybridizations and protein bioassay or immunoassay techniques which include membrane, solution, or chip based technologies for the detection and/or quantification of nucleic acid or protein.</p>The presence of polynucleotide sequences encoding IHLP can be detected by DNA-DNA or DNA-RNA hybridization or amplification using probes or fragments or fragments of polynucleotides encoding IHLP. Nucleic acid amplification based assays involve the use of oligonucleotides or oligomers based on the sequences encoding IHLP to detect transformants containing DNA or RNA encoding IHLP.</p>A variety of protocols for detecting and measuring the expression of IHLP, using either polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies specific for the protein are known in the art. Examples include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay (RIA), and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). A two-site, monoclonal-based immunoassay utilizing monoclonal antibodies reactive to two non-interfering epitopes on IHLP is preferred, but a competitive binding assay may be employed. These and other assays are described, among other places, in Hampton, R. et al. (1990; Serological Methods, a Laboratory Manual, APS Press, St Paul, Minn.) and Maddox, D. E. et al. (1983; J. Exp. Med. 158:1211-1216).</p>A wide variety of labels and conjugation techniques are known by those skilled in the art and may be used in various nucleic acid and amino acid assays. Means for producing labeled hybridization or PCR probes for detecting sequences related to polynucleotides encoding IHLP include oligolabeling, nick translation, end-labeling or PCR amplification using a labeled nucleotide. Alternatively, the sequences encoding IHLP, or any fragments thereof may be cloned into a vector for the production of an mRNA probe. Such vectors are known in the art, are commercially available, and may be used to synthesize RNA probes in vitro by addition of an appropriate RNA polymerase such as T7, T3, or SP6 and labeled nucleotides. These procedures may be conducted using a variety of commercially available kits (Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn, (Kalamazoo, Mich.); Promega (Madison Wis.); and U.S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, Ohio). Suitable reporter molecules or labels, which may be used for ease of detection, include radionuclides, enzymes, fluorescent, chemiluminescent, or chromogenic agents as well as substrates, cofactors, inhibitors, magnetic particles, and the like.</p>Host cells transformed with nucleotide sequences encoding IHLP may be cultured under con",
    "main utilized in the FLAGS extension/affinity purification system (Immunex Corp., Seattle, Wash.). The inclusion of cleavable linker sequences such as those specific for Factor XA or enterokinase (Invitrogen, San Diego, Calif.) between the purification domain and IHLP may be used to facilitate purification. One such expression vector provides for expression of a fusion protein containing IHLP and a nucleic acid encoding 6 histidine residues preceding a thioredoxin or an enterokinase cleavage site. The histidine residues facilitate purification on IMAC (immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography as described in Porath, J. et al. (1992, Prot. Exp. Purif. 3: 263-281) while the enterokinase cleavage site provides a means for purifying IHLP from the fusion protein. A discussion of vectors which contain fusion proteins is provided in Kroll, D. J. et al. (1993; DNA Cell Biol. 12:441-453).</p>In addition to recombinant production, fragments of IHLP may be produced by direct peptide synthesis using solid-phase techniques Merrifield J. (1963) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 85:2149-2154). Protein synthesis may be performed using manual techniques or by automation. Automated synthesis may be achieved, for example, using Applied Biosystems 431A Peptide Synthesizer (Perkin Elmer). Various fragments of IHLP may be chemically synthesized separately and combined using chemical methods to produce the full length molecule.</p>THERAPEUTICSChemical and structural homology exits among IHLP (SEQ ID NO:1),24 kD rat lysophospholipase (SEQ ID NO:3) and P. fluorescens carboxyesterase (SEQ ID NO:4). Expression of lysophospholipase is inducible, appears to be associated with the proliferation and differentiation of cells of the immune system, and functions to regulate the activities of lysophospholipids. Northern analysis (FIG. 3) shows the expression of IHLP in cDNA libraries associated with inflammation and disorders associated with immune response and cell proliferation. Therefore, IHLP may be used to treat or prevent inflammation and disorders associated with immune response and cell proliferation, particularly disorders of the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems and cancers.</p>In one embodiment, IHLP or a fragment or derivative thereof may be administered to a subject to reduce immune response. Although the inventors do not wish to be limited to a particular mechanism of action, it is thought that reduction would at least protect against lysophospholipid toxicity, deacylate platelet activating factor, and hydrolyze lytic lysophospholipids such as lysophosphatidylcholine which contribute to immune response, and in particular hypersensitivity reactions and immune cell mediated injuries. Such injuries include, but are not limited to, adult respiratory distress syndrome, allergies, asthma, arteriosclerosis, bronchitis, emphysema, hypereosinophilia, myocardial or pericardial inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis, complications of heart attack, stroke, cancer, hemodialysis, infec",
    "unoglobin libraries (Burton D. R. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 88:11120-3).</p>Antibodies may also be produced by inducing in vivo production in the lymphocyte population or by screening immunoglobulin libraries or panels of highly specific binding reagents as disclosed in the literature (Orlandi, R. et al. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 86: 3833-3837; Winter, G. et al. (1991) Nature 349:293-299).</p>Antibody fragments which contain specific binding sites for IHLP may also be generated. For example, such fragments include, but are not limited to, the F(ab')2 fragments which can be produced by pepsin digestion of the antibody molecule and the Fab fragments which can be generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of the F(ab')2 fragments. Alternatively, Fab expression libraries may be constructed to allow rapid and easy identification of monoclonal Fab fragments with the desired specificity (Huse, W. D. et al. (1989) Science 254:1275-1281).</p>Various immunoassays may be used for screening to identify antibodies having the desired specificity. Numerous protocols for competitive binding or immunoradiometric assays using either polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies with established specificities are well known in the art. Such immunoassays typically involve the measurement of complex formation between IHLP and its specific antibody. A two-site, monoclonal-based immunoassay utilizing monoclonal antibodies reactive to two non-interfering IHLP epitopes is preferred, but a competitive binding assay may also be employed (Maddox, supra).</p>In another embodiment of the invention, the polynucleotides encoding IHLP, or any fragment or complement thereof, may be used for therapeutic purposes. In one aspect, the complement of the polynucleotide encoding IHLP may be used in situations in which it would be desirable to block the transcription of the mRNA. In particular, cells may be transformed with sequences complementary to polynucleotides encoding IHLP. Thus, complementary molecules or fragments may be used to modulate IHLP activity, or to achieve regulation of gene function. Such technology is now well known in the art, and sense or antisense oligonucleotides or larger fragments, can be designed from various locations along the coding or control regions of sequences encoding IHLP.</p>Expression vectors derived from retro viruses, adenovirus, herpes or vaccinia viruses, or from various bacterial plasmids may be used for delivery of nucleotide sequences to the targeted organ, tissue or cell population. Methods which are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct vectors which will express nucleic acid sequence which is complementary to the polynucleotides of the gene encoding IHLP. These techniques are described both in Sambrook et al. (supra) and in Ausubel et al. (supra).</p>Genes encoding IHLP can be turned off by transforming a cell or tissue with expression vectors which express high levels of a polynucleotide or fragment thereof which encodes IHLP. Such constructs may be used to introduce untranslatable sense or antisense sequences into a cell. Even in the absence of integration into the DNA, such vectors may continue to transcribe RNA molecules until they are disabled by endogenous nucleases. Transient expression may last for a month or more with a non-replicating vector and even longer if appropriate replication elements are part of the vector system.</p>As mentioned above, modifications of gene expression can be obtained by designing complementary sequences or antisense molecules (DNA, RNA, or PNA) to the control, 5' or regulatory regions of the gene encoding IHLP (signal sequence, promoters, enhancers, and introns). Oligonucleotides derived from the transcription initiation site, e.g., between positions -10 and +10 from the start site, are preferred. Similarly, inhibition can be achieved using \"triple helix\" base-pairing methodology. Triple helix pairing is useful because it causes inhibition of the ability of the double helix to open sufficiently for the binding of polymerases, transcription factors, or regulatory molecules. Recent therapeutic advances using triplex DNA have been described in the literature (Gee, J. E. et al. (1994) In: Huber, B. E. and B. I. Carr, Molecular and Immunologic Approaches, Futura Publishing Co., Mt. Kisco, N.Y.). The complementary sequence or antisense molecule may also be designed to block translation of mRNA by preventing the transcript from binding to ribosomes.</p>Ribozymes, enzymatic RNA molecules, may also be used to catalyze the specific cleavage of RNA. The mechanism of ribozyme action involves sequence-specific hybridization of the ribozyme molecule to complementary target RNA, followed by endonucleolytic cleavage. Examples which may be used include engineered hammerhead motif ribozyme molecules that can specifically and efficiently catalyze endonucleolytic cleavage of sequences encoding IHLP.</p>Specific ribozyme cleavage sites within any potential RNA target are initially identified by scanning the target molecule for ribozyme cleavage sites which include the following sequences: GUA, GUU, and GUC. Once identified, short RNA sequences of between 15 and 20 ribonucleotides corresponding to the region of the target gene containing the cleavage site may be evaluated for secondary structural features which may render the oligonucleotide inoperable. The suitability of candidate targets may also be evaluated by testing"
