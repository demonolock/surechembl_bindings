The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio between the LD50 and the ED50 (or IC50). Compounds exhibiting high therapeutic indices are preferred. Data obtained from these cell culture assays can be used to estimate a range of human doses. The dosage or applied amount of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 (or IC50) with little or no toxicity.</p><p id=\"p150\" num=\"150\">The term \"administration\" of the present invention refers to the act of introducing the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention to a subject by any appropriate method, and the route of administration may be administered through various oral or parenteral routes as long as it can reach the target tissue. there is.</p><p id=\"p151\" num=\"151\">The administration route of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be administered through any general route as long as it can reach the target tissue. The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is not particularly limited thereto, but may be administered intraperitoneally, intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intradermally, orally, intranasally, intrapulmonaryly, or intrarectally, as desired. In addition, the composition may be administered by any device capable of transporting an active substance to a target cell.</p><p id=\"p152\" num=\"152\">The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be administered as an individual therapeutic agent or in combination with other therapeutic agents, and may be administered sequentially or simultaneously with conventional therapeutic agents. And it can be single or multiple administrations. It is important to administer the amount that can obtain the maximum effect with the minimum amount without side effects in consideration of all the above factors.</p><p id=\"p153\" num=\"153\"/>"
