    " above, and an effective amount of tPA, or other fibrinolytic agent, for parenteral administration, as described above. Such kit can comprise, for example, both pharmaceutical agents in separate containers or the same container, optionally as lyophilized plugs, and containers of solutions for reconstitution. A variation of this is to include the solution for reconstitution and the lyophilized plug in two chambers of a single container, which can be caused to admix prior to use. With such an arrangement, the fibrinolytic and the compound may be packaged separately, as in two containers, or lyophilized together as a powder and provided in a single container.</p>When both agents are provided in solution form, they can be contained in an infusion/injection system for simultaneous administration or in a tandem arrangement. For example, the platelet aggregation inhibitor may be in an i.v. injectable form, or infusion bag linked in series, via tubing, to the fibrinolytic agent in a second infusion bag. Using such a system, a patient can receive an initial bolus-type injection or infusion, of the inhibitor followed by an infusion of the fibrinolytic agent.</p>The pharmacological activity of the compounds of this invention is assessed by their ability to inhibit the binding of <sup>3</sup> H-SK&amp;F 107260, a known RGD-fibrinogen antagonist, to the GPIIbIIIa receptor; their ability to inhibit platelet aggregation, in vitro, and their ability to inhibit thrombus formation in vivo.</p>Inhibition of RGD-mediated GPIIb-IIIa binding</p>Inhibition of RGD-mediated GPIIb-IIIa binding was demonstrated by assessing the ability of compounds to inhibit the binding of <sup>3</sup> H-SK&amp;F 107260, a known RGD-fibrinogen antagonist, to the GPIIbIIIa receptor according to the procedure disclosed in WO 93/00095 (PCT/US/92/05463.</p>Inhibition of Platelet Aggregation</p>Inhibition of platelet aggregation was demonstrated following the procedure disclosed in WO 93/00095 (PCT/US/92/05463).</p>The compounds of this invention generally inhibit the aggregation of human platelets stimulated with ADP with IC50 of less than 0.1 uM. The compounds of Examples 7, 22, 23 and 26 have IC50 of between 0.2 and 11 uM, and the compound of Example 4 had an IC50 of about 75 uM. Preferred compounds have IC50 of less than 0.04 uM.</p>To assess the stability of the compounds to plasma proteases, the compounds were incubated for 3 h (rather than 3 min) in the PRP prior to addition of the agonist.</p>In Vivo Inhibition of Platelet Aggregation</p>In vivo inhibition of thrombus formation is demonstrated by recording the systemic and hemodynamic effects of infusion of the compounds into anesthetized dogs according to the methods described in Aiken et al., Prostaglandins, 19, 629 (1980). Alternately, inhibition of thrombus formation and bioavailability may be measured by the method disclosed by Nichols et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 270, 614 (1994).</p>The examples which follow are intended to in no way limit the scope of this invention, but are provided to illustrate how to make and use the compounds of this invention. Many other embodiments will be readily apparent and available to those skilled in the art.</p>EXAMPLESIn the Examples, all temperatures are in degrees Centigrade. Mass spectra were performed using fast atom bombardment (FAB) or electro-spray (ES) ionization. Melting points were taken on a Thomas-Hoover capillary melting point apparatus and are uncorrected.</p>NMR were recorded at 250 MHz using a Bruker AM 250 spectrometer, unless otherwise indicated. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm (\u03b4) downfield from tetramethylsilane. Multiplicities for NMR spectra are indicated as: s=singlet, d=doutblet, t=triplet, q=quartet, m=multiplet, dd=doublet of doublets, dt=doublet of triplets etc. and br indicates a broad signal. J indicates the NMR coupling constant in Hertz.</p>Celite\u00ae is filter aid composed of acid washed diatomaceous silica, and is a registered trademark of Mansville Corp., Denver, Colo.
