    "doma cells may be cultured in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, immortalized cells. For example, if the parental cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (\u201cHAT medium\u201d), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.</p>Preferred immortalized cell lines are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high level expression of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. More preferred immortalized cell lines are murine myeloma lines, which can be obtained, for instance, from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif. and the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies [Kozbor, J. Immunol., 133:3001 (1984); Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, (1987) pp. 51-63].</p>The culture medium in which the hybridoma cells are cultured can then be assayed for the presence of monoclonal antibodies directed against PRO. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by the hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). Such techniques and assays are known in the art. The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson and Pollard, Anal. Biochem., 107:220 (1980).</p>After the desired hybridoma cells are identified, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods [Goding, supra]. Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium and RPMI-1640 medium. Alternatively, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites in a mammal.</p>The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones may be isolated or purified from the culture medium or ascites fluid by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography.</p>The monoclonal antibodies may also be made by recombinant DNA methods, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567. DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The hybridoma cells of the invention serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be placed into expres",
    "ub>2</sub>, conditioned media were quantitated for TNF-\u03b1 using and ELISA assay kit (R&amp;D Systems).</p>Human foreskin fibroblast cells (ATCC) were separately cultured in MEM media (10% PBS) in the presence of f17B (PRO1031), and IL-17C (PRO1122). After incubation for 18 hours at 37\u00b0 C. and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, conditioned media were assayed for IL-6 using an ELISA kit (R&amp;D Systems). In contrast to the high level of IL-6 induced by IL-17, both IL-17B (PRO1031) and IL17C (PRO1122) failed to stimulate IL-6 secretion in fibroblast cells (as shown in FIG. 36A).</p>Using the procedure outlined in Yao et al., Cytokine, 9: 794 (1997), a human leukemic monocytic cell line, THP-1, was used to assay for the stimulation of TNF-\u03b1 release by IL17, IL-17B (PRO1031) and IL-17C (PRO1031) by culturing in RPMI media (10% FBS). After incubation for 18 hour at 37\u00b0 C. and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, conditioned media were quantitated for TNF-\u03b1 using an ELISA assay kit (R&amp;D Systems). While IL-17 induced only a low level of TNF-\u03b1 in THP-1 cells, both IL-17B and IL-17C (as Fc fusion proteins) stimulated TNF-\u03b1 production in THP-1 cells (as shown in FIG. 36B). A control Fc fusion protein had no effect.</p>In order to further characterize the stimulation of TNF-\u03b1 release by IL-17B and IL-17C, the time course and concentration dependence of the response were assayed in THP-1 cells. FIG. 37 illustrates that IL-17B and IL-17C stimulate the release of TNF-\u03b1 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The EC50 for IL-17B stimulation is 2.4 nM, while the EC50 for IL-17C is 25 nM.</p>While the IL-17B and IL-17C preparations used in these experiments contained undetectable level of endotoxin (less than 1 EU/ml), additional control experiments were performed to confirm that the TNF-\u03b1 release from THP-1 cells was real and not artifactual. The IL-17B and IL-17C activities were unaffected by polymyxin B treatment and were abolished by heat treatment, further supporting the notion that the proteins themselves were responsible for the activities and not any contaminating endotoxin.</p>Preparations of IL-17E were used to study the effect on IL-6 production in human articular cartilage. Human articular cartilage was removed from human patients during surgery for joint replacement and cartilage explants were prepared as described in EXAMPLE 30 below. As shown in FIG. 46C, IL-17E was observed to induce IL-6 production in human articular cartilage. Human articular cartilage from diseased joints was cultured in media alone (\u2212) or in combination with IL-17E at 0.1 nM, 1 nM or 10 nM concentrations and matrix synthesis was determined by an ELISA kit (R&amp;D Systems) as described above. In contrast to the both IL-17B (PRO1031) and IL17C (PRO1122) which failed to stimulate IL-6 secretion in fibroblast cells (shown in FIG. 36A), IL-17E induced the production of IL-6, thereby exhibiting biological effects similar to IL-17 with respect to IL-6 release. IL-17 at 10 nM induced the production of IL-6 in human articular cartilage at comparable elevat"
