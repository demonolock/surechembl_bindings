The HL116 clone (Uze et al., 1994) is derived from the human HT1080 cell line. It contains the firefly luciferase gene controlled by the IFN-inducible 6-16 promoter. The derived HL116-mLR10 clone which expresses the murine leptin receptor was described (PCT/EP2013/050787).</p>Measurement of the Luciferase ActivitiesAntagonistic IFN activities were measured by quantifying the inhibition of the luciferase activity induced in HL116 cells and on the HL116-mLR10 expressing the mLR by IFN\u03b12 or IFN\u03b2. The IC50 values were calculated using nonlinear data regression with Prism software (GraphPad). Luciferase activities were determined on a Berthold Centro LB960 luminometer using a luciferase substrate buffer (20 mM Tricine, 1.07 mM (MgCO3)4 Mg(OH)2\u20225H20, 2.67 mM MgSO4\u20227H20, 0.1 mM EDTA, 33.3 mM dithiothreitol, 270 \u03bcM coenzyme A, 470 \u03bcM luciferin, 530 \u03bcM ATP, final pH 7.8) after 6 hr IFN stimulation.</p>Example 1The Nanobody-IFN\u03b12-R120E Fusion ProteinThe nanobody 4-11, directed against the murine leptin receptor was fused to the IFN\u03b12 mutant R120E as described in the materials and methods</p>FIG. 1 shows a schematic representation of the nanobody-IFN antagonist fusion protein constructed with the nanobody 4-11 against the murine leptin receptor and the human IFN\u03b12-R120E (numbering as in Piehler et al., 2000).</p>Example 2Targeted Inhibition of IFN\u03b1 Activity on mLR-Expressing CellsParental HL116 cells and the derived HL116-mLR10 cells which express the mouse leptin receptor were treated for 6 hours with 10 pM IFN\u03b12 in the presence of several dilutions of culture medium conditioned by Hek 293T cells expressing the 4-11-IFN\u03b12-R120E fusion protein. The 10 pM IFN\u03b12 dose was chosen because it corresponds to the IFN\u03b12 EC50 on both cell lines. Cells were then lysed and the IFN-induced luciferase activity was quantified. At the higher concentration tested, the 4-11-IFN\u03b12-R120E fusion protein was unable to inhibit IFN\u03b12 action on untargeted HL116 cells (FIG. 2A). In contrast, its dose-dependent inhibition effect is clear on HL116-mLR10 cells which express the target of the 4-11 nanobody (FIG. 2B).</p>Example 3Targeted Inhibition of IFN\u03b2 Activity on mLR-Expressing CellsAmong the subtypes which constitute the human type I IFN, the IFN\u03b2 shows the highest affinity for the IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor. We thus tested whether the 4-11-IFN\u03b12-R120E fusion protein exerts also an antagonistic activity against IFN\u03b2 action.</p>Parental HL116 cells and the derived HL116-mLR10 cells which express the mouse leptin receptor were treated for 6 hours with 1 pM IFN\u03b2 in the presence of several dilutions of culture medium conditioned by Hek 293T cells expressing the 4-11-IFN\u03b12-R120E fusion protein. The 1 pM IFN\u03b2 dose was chosen because it corresponds to the IFN\u03b2 EC50 on both cell lines. Cells were then lysed and the IFN-induced luciferase activity was quantified. At the higher concentration tested, the 4-11-IFN\u03b12-R120E fusion protein was unable to inhibit IFN\u03b12 action on untargeted HL116 cells (FIG. 3A). In contrast, its dose-dependent inhibition effect is clear on HL116-mLR10 cells which express the target of the 4-11 nanobody (FIG. 3B).</p>Example 4Specific Inhibition of IFN\u03b12-Induced STAT1 Phosphorylation in B-Cells within Human Whole PBMCsThe type I IFN antagonist IFN\u03b12-R120E was fused to the anti-human CD20 nanobody 2HCD25 through a linker sequence made with 20 repeats of GGS motif. The fusion protein was produced in E. coli and purified by Immobilized Metal Affinity chromatography (IMAC). Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are expected to contain \u22484% of B-cells which can be characterized by the cell surface expression of CD19. The large majority of circulating B-cells are also positive for the expression of CD20.</p>PBMCs were isolated over ficoll gradient (histopaque-1077, Sigma-Aldrich) from blood samples of healthy donors. Cells were left untreated or were incubated for 15 minutes with 50 pM of human IFN\u03b12 in the absence or presence of 10 \u03bcg/ml of the 2HCD25 nanobody\u2014IFN\u03b12-R120E fusion protein.</p>Cells were then fixed (BD Fix Buffer I), permeabilized (BD Perm Buffer III) and labelled with PE-labelled anti pSTAT1 (BD#612564) and APC-labelled anti human CD19 (BD #555415). FACS data were acquired using a BD FACS "
