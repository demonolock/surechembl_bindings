{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n* Fig. 3 shows that sulfoagarotriose targets SGLT1 and 2 to inhibit its glucose transport activity, SGLT1 IC50 represents the half inhibition concentration of sulfur agarotriose on SGLT1 activity, SGLT2 IC50 represents the half inhibition concentration of sulfur agarotriose on SGLT2 activity. \n\nNote: Unfortunately, there are no sentences in the provided text that include a specific numeric value and unit for the bioactivity metric. The sentence above is the closest match, but it does not include a specific numeric value and unit. If you would like, I can try to help you further or provide more context."}
