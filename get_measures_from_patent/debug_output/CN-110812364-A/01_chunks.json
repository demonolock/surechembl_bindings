    "plasmid transfected group, SGLT2 represents the SGLT2 protein expression level, \u03b2 -actin represents \u03b2 -actin, HEK293 represents the untransfected group, HEK293-SGLT1 represents the SGLT1 stably transfected cell group, HEK293-SGLT2 represents the SGLT2 stably transfected cell group, P &lt;0.05 &gt; is compared with the untransfected blank Control group, # P &lt;0.05 &gt; is compared with the empty plasmid transfected group, wherein (a) is a graph showing that SGLT1 stably transfected cell line protein expression n (protein) and the left stably transfected cell line (light) are shown in the SGLT1 and 2 stably transfected cell line), and the right stably transfected line 8653 (SGLT) is shown in the SGLT transverse chart, and the SGLT transverse chart shows the change of the SGLT 8458 and the horizontal change of the horizontal and vertical coordinate (SGLT) of the horizontal change of the SGLT 8458 and vertical coordinate (SGLT 849 and vertical coordinate of the horizontal change of the protein expression of the horizontal change of the protein of the SGLT1 and the horizontal change of the SGLT transverse coordinate of the stable cell line representing the SGLT1 and the horizontal change of the SGLT longitudinal change of the SGLT transverse graph (SGLT 849 and the stable cell line of the horizontal change of the cell line of the sample).</p>Fig. 3 shows that sulfoagarotriose targets SGLT1 and 2 to inhibit its glucose transport activity. GF3 represents sulfur agarotriose, SGLT1 IC50 represents the half inhibition concentration of sulfur agarotriose on SGLT1 activity, SGLT2 IC50 represents the half inhibition concentration of sulfur agarotriose on SGLT2 activity, and% inhibition represents the inhibition rate of different concentrations of GF3 on SGLT activity. Wherein (a) is a graph showing the results of the inhibition rate of GF3 on SGLT 1; (b) the graph shows the results of the inhibition rate of GF3 against SGLT 2.</p>FIG. 4 is a graph of the results of an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) with a series of galactooligosaccharides to lower postprandial blood glucose. Control represents blank Control group, SAOs represents sulfoagaro-oligosaccharide treatment group, AOs represents agaro-oligosaccharide treatment group, and POs represents porphyran-oligosaccharide treatment group. Wherein, the graph (a) is a result graph of Blood glucose levels at different time points of an OGTT experiment, the abscissa represents the testing time (min), and the ordinate represents the Blood glucose (mmol/L) represents the Blood glucose level; (b) the figure is a graph of the integration result of the Area under the curve of the OGTT experiment, the abscissa represents different treatment groups, and the ordinate represents the Area under the curve (mmol/L.min).</p>FIG. 5 is a graph of the results of SAOs decreasing blood glucose and increasing insulin sensitivity and urine glucose in type 2 diabetic (T2DM) mice. P &lt;0.05, compared to normal group mice; # P &lt;0.05, compared to group T2 DM. Control stands for low-fat diet treated group, Model stands for h"
