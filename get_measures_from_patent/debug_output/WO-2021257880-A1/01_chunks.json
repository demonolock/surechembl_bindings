The present disclosure additionally relates to active ingredients, compositions, and methods for improving effectiveness of a vaccine in a mammal. \n\nAldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) Modulators </p>Aldehyde dehydrogenases are a group of enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of aldehydes. They convert aldehydes to carboxylic acids. The produced carboxylic acids leave the liver (where the highest concentration of the enzymes are located) and are metabolized by the body\u2019s muscle and heart. There are three different classes of these enzymes in mammals: class 1 (ALDH1, low Km, cytosolic), class 2 (ALDH2, low Km, mitochondrial), and class 3 (ALDH3, high Km, such as those expressed in tumors, stomach, and cornea). To date, nineteen ALDH genes have been identified within the human genome. These enzymes participate in a wide variety of biological processes including the detoxification of exogenously and endogenously generated aldehydes, e.g., from alcohol oxidation. </p>Aspects of the present disclosure relate to active ingredients, compositions, and methods for increasing lifespan, for preventing or treating an aging-related disorder, for reducing a symptom of aging, boo",

Disulfiram was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1951 for alcohol aversion therapy after researchers observed that it induced the effects of a hangover after alcohol consumption. Disulfiram blocks the major metabolic reaction that converts alcohol into acetaldehyde. Disulfiram (also known as Tetraethylthiuram disulfide, Antabuse, Antabus, diethylcarbamothioylsulfanyl N,N-diethylcarbamodithioate, and 1-</p>(diethylthiocarbamoyldisulfanyl)-N,N-diethyl-methanethioamide; CAS Reference Number: 97- 77-8) has a structure of Formula (I): \n<img id=\"imgf000014_0001\" path=\"imgf000014_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/900018918/WO/20211223/A1/002021/25/78/80/imgf000014_0001.tif\"/>\n </p>Formula (I). \n\nAs used herein, the term disulfiram includes disulfiram itself and any pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or prodrug thereof. </p>As used herein, the term disulfiram includes disulfiram itself and any of its metabolites and/or their derivatives and variants thereof.

In vitro, aloe-emodin treatments led to the dissociation of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and ER a and increased ER a ubiquitination. Protein fractionation results suggest that aloe-emodin induces cytosolic ER a degradation. Aloe-emodin inhibits both proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of PC3 cells. Protein content analysis suggests that activation of the downstream substrates of mTORC2, Akt and PKCa, is inhibited by aloe-emodin treatment. Pull-down assay and in vitro kinase assay results indicate that aloe-emodin binds with mTORC2 in cells and inhibits its kinase activity. Aloe- emodin downregulates mRNA expression and promoter/gelatinolytic activity of Matrix Metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/9, as well as the RhoB expression at gene and protein level. Aloe- emodin suppresses the nuclear translocation and DNA binding of NF-KB. It has been shown to have specific in vitro antitumor activity.

    "e / no treatment) x (TBHQ alone / no treatment)] at each concentration combination. Values greater than 1 were considered synergistic.</p>Synergy using the Loewe additivity model was calculated using synergyfmder package on R (software environment for statistical computing and graphics; see the World Wide Web (at) /bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/synergyfinder/inst/doc/synergyfinder.pdf, the contents of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety). The Loewe additivity model assumes the null hypothesis that a combination of drugs is the same as increasing the concentration of either drug alone {i.e. the effect is simply additive rather than the drugs interacting to produce a greater effect). y<sub>e</sub> is the effect as if a drug is combined with itself, i.e., y<sup>e</sup> = yi(xi + X2) = y2(xi + X2).</p>Using R, the synergy score is calculated using ye, and determined to be the difference between the observed effect and the expected effect. Score negativity or positivity determines whether the combination is synergistic or antagonist, respectively. Loewe S. (1953), The problem of synergism and antagonism of combined drugs.

Statistical significance was determined using a standard Student\u2019s t-test (unpaired, 2-tailed). \n\nIndividual curves for disulfiram alone, TBHQ alone, and the combination of the two were plotted as log of the relative concentrations of each. In these experiments, disulfiram and TBHQ were titrated equally with different starting concentrations of disulfiram and TBHQ and so the relative ratio of disulfiram: TBHQ was maintained across the entire curve. The concentrations were normalized so that 1 is set as the median for each curve, and the curves are plotted as 1.5x dilution series. </p>Curves of disulfiram + constant concentrations of TBHQ were plotted using the log of disulfiram concentration. </p>FIG. 5 is a table showing the percent leftward shift in IC50 mediated by TBHQ relative to disulfiram alone in a dose-dependent matter, while TBHQ alone has no effect on pyroptosis inhibition or IC50. Accordingly, these data show synergistic effects on pyroptotic inhibition when cells are subjected to a combination of disulfiram and TBHQ. </p>Example 10: Methods that comprise administering disulfiram and TBHQ In this example, a composition comprising disulfiram and TBHQ, or distinct compositions of a first composition comprising disulfiram and a second composition comprising TBHQ are administered to a mammal, e.g., a human, for increasing lifespan, for preventing or treating a disease including an aging-related disorder, for reducing a symptom of aging, and/or boosting an immune system (e.g, for treating an infection). </p>The dose of disulfiram is from about 5 mg to about 500 mg. The dose of the TBHQ is from about 0.001 mg to about 280 mg. The amount of disulfiram may be from about 5 mg to about 500 mg and the amount of tert-Butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) may be from about 0.02% to about 56% by weight of disulfiram. In some cases, the amount of disulfiram is from about 5 mg to about 500 mg and the amount of TBHQ is up to about 37 mg. In various cases, the amount of disulfiram is about 500 mg and the amount of TBHQ is up to about 37 mg. In a specific case, the amount of disulfiram is 500 mg and the amount of TBHQ is 37 mg. </p>Administration of the compositions is by intravenous injection or infusion, intraperitoneal injection, intramuscular injection, or subcutaneous injection, with a dose depending on the quantity of composition needing to be administered.
