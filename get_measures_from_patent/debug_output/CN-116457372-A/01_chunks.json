An \"activator\" or \"activating antibody\" or \"agonist antibody\" is a substance that enhances or initiates the innate activity of the antigen to which it binds, typically triggered by the binding of the antigen to its natural ligand, particularly the signaling of the antigen. In the context of the present invention, the term \"CD137 agonist\" encompasses MA1 as used i",
    "ed to current treatment regimens. </p>The inventors of the present invention have further found that a certain balance of affinities of CD137-BD and PDL1-BD with respect to each other, i.e. the affinity of PDL1-BD for PDL1 is significantly higher with respect to the affinity of CD137-BD for CD137, is to ensure: effective concentration (IC) at which PDL1/PD-1 interaction reaches maximum inhibition <sub>100</sub> ) It is necessary to fall well within the concentration range where the CD 137-driven NF- \u03bab signal reaches maximum activation. Thus, the concentration window of maximum activity is significantly prolonged (e.g., comparing fig. 2C and fig. 2A), which is predicted to be beneficial for therapeutic applications, and allows for greater flexibility in the administration of the multispecific antibody or pharmaceutical composition comprising the multispecific antibody. If PDL1-BD and CD137-BD bind to their respective targetsOr the affinity of PDL+ -BD for PDL1 (K <sub>D</sub> ) Only slightly less (better) than the affinity (K) of CD137-BD for CD137 <sub>D</sub> ) The effective concentrations to achieve maximum PDL1 blocking and maximum CD 137-mediated signaling will not overlap (fig. 2A and 2B), which is believed to reduce the overall efficacy and therapeutic applicability of such antibodies. Thus, in one embodiment, the multispecific antibody used in the present invention comprises at least one CD137-BD and at least one PDL1-BD, wherein said CD137-BD binds to the monovalent dissociation constant (K  <sub>D</sub> ) A monovalent dissociation constant (K) that is greater than that of the PDL1-BD conjugate human PDL1 <sub>D</sub> ) At least 5-fold, preferably at least 10-fold, such as at least 20, at least 30, at least 50, at least 100-fold higher, in particular wherein said CD137-BD binds to human CD137 with a monovalent dissociation constant (K <sub>D</sub> ) A monovalent dissociation constant (K) that is greater than that of the PDL1-BD conjugate human PDL1 <sub>D</sub> ) 20 to 1000 times, preferably 30 to 800 times, in particular 50 to 500 times higher.</p>Importantly, the multi-specific antibody MA1 specific for CD137 used in the present invention cannot systematically induce CD137 signaling due to lack of activation of CD137 in the absence of aggregation (which is caused by binding of PDL1-BD to its antigen).</p>In one embodiment, the multispecific antibody MA1 consists of one CD137-BD and one PDL 1-BD.</p>The term \"CD137\" refers in particular to human CD137 with a UniProt ID number Q07011, reproduced herein as SEQ ID NO: 89. Suitably, the CD137-BD of the present invention targets CD137, in particular human CD137, as shown in UniProt ID No. Q07011, which is reproduced herein as SEQ ID No. 89. Suitably, the multispecific antibodies used in the present invention comprise CD137-BD, which target human and cynomolgus monkey CD137. Preferably, the multispecific antibodies used in the present invention comprise CD137-BD, which does not block the CD137/CD137L interaction. </p>In one embodiment, CD137-BD does not cross-compete for binding to Wu Ruilu mab. Thus, the epitope bound by CD137-BD and Wu Ruilu mab is different. Wu Ruilu mAb, also known as BMS-663513, is a fully humanized IgG4 mAb from Bristol-Myers Squibb and is described in WO 2004/010947, US 6,887,673 and US 7,214,493. In another embodiment, the CD137-BD used in the present invention cross-competes for binding to Wu Ruilu mab.</p>In one embodiment, CD137-BD does not cross-compete for binding to Wu Tuolu mab. Thus, the epitope bound by CD137-BD and Wu Tuolu mab is different. Wu Tuolu mAb, also known as PF-05082566, is a fully humanized IgG2 mAb from Pfizer and is described in WO 2012/032333 and US 8,821,867. In another embodiment, the CD137-BD used in the present invention cross-competes for binding to Wu Tuolu mab.</p>In another embodiment, CD137-BD does not cross-compete for binding to both Wu Ruilu mab and Wu Tuolu mab. Thus, CD137-BD is different from the epitope to which Wu Ruilu mab and Wu Tuolu mab bind.</p>The terms \"compete\" or \"cross-compete\" and related terms are used interchangeably herein to refer to the ability of one antibody or other binding agent to interfere with the binding of other antibodies or binding agents to CD137 in a standard competitive binding assay. </p>As used herein, the term \"identical epitope\" refers to unique protein determinants on the same protein that are capable of specifically binding to an antibody, wherein these unique protein determinants are identical, i.e., are composed of groups of identical chemically active surface molecules (e.g., amino acids or sugar side chains) having the same three-dimensional structural characteristics as well as the same charge characteristics. The term \"distinct epitopes\", as used herein in connection with a particular protein target, refers to unique protein determinants on the same protein that are capable of specifically binding to an antibody, wherein these unique protein determinants are not identical, i.e., consist of different groups of chemically active surface molecules (e.g., amino acids or sugar side chains) having different three-dimensional structural characteristics as well as different charge characteristics. These different epitopes may be overlapping or non-overlapping.</p>Suitably, the CD137-BD of MA1 is further characterized by one or more of the following parameters:</p>f. when in scFv format, the melting temperature (Tm) thereof (as determined by differential scanning fluorescence) is at least 50 \u2103, preferably at least 55 \u2103, more preferably at least 60 \u2103, especially wherein the antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof is formulated in a phosphate citrate buffer at pH 6.4, 150mM NaCl, especially wherein the antibody is formulated in a 50mM ",
