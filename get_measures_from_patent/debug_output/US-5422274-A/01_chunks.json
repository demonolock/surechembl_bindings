    "tein, is collected and purified.</p>Cell culture methods which may be employed in the practice of the invention include, for example, use of adherent cells or growth of cells in a suspension. Conditioned medium (CM) can be collected from cells grown in suspension or adhered to solid supports, i.e., CM is prepared from adherent cells grown in roller bottles or grown on sol id supports and cultured in suspension or in fluidized or packed beds. CM is prepared from suspension cells in stirred-tank vessels.</p>The sT4 of the invention includes derivatives of the extracellular domain of T4. Such derivatives comprise addition, deletions or subsitutions which alterations do not significantly adversely affect secretion of the protein into the conditioned medium and the affinity of the protein for HIV env protein, i.e., gp120. For example, one or a few amino acids can be added to or deleted from the N- or C- terminus. Or, one or a few amino acids, preferably no more than four amino acids can be inserted into, deleted or substituted for internal amino acids. Alternatively, a hybrid protein, i.e., a translational fusion, can be constructed between sT4 and a protein carrier, another antigen or other sT4 molecules to prepare a poly-sT4 molecule. In yet another alternative, sT4 can be synthetically conjugated to a carrier molecule.</p>One embodiment of a sT4 derivative is illustrated in the Examples below (see Example 3). Affinity of the sT4 for HIV env can be demonstrated by a competitive binding assay using a sT4 molecule having a known affinity or using antibodies which recognize the T4 receptor, such as OKT4 and OKT4A. Useful derivative sT4 molecules of the invention are selectively precipitated from conditioned medium by OKT4A as shown in Example 3. Derivatives can be prepared chemically, after expression, or genetically, prior to expression, by manipulation of the coding sequence for the leader and/or extracellular domain.</p>The sT4 of the invention can be purified from the spent culture media using various protein purification techniques, for example, affinity chromatography; ion exchange chromatography; size exclusion chromatography; hydrophobic chromatography or reversed phase chromatography.</p>sT4 can be purified by affinity chromatography using general group-specific adsorbants, for example, carbohydrate binding or dye affinity ligands; or using ligands that specifically bind to sT4, for example, monoclonal antibody or HIV gp120 protein or portions thereof.</p>An exemplary purification scheme comprises: (1) growing cells in a serum-free selection growth media; (2) clarification of the conditioned media; and (3) separation of sT4 of the invention from other proteins present in the conditioned media.</p>In the preferred method, the sT4 is purified from the serum-free culture medium using a series of chromatography steps which are based on the physical properties of the sT4 molecule. The sT4 may also be purified from culture medium containing serum us",
    "k promoter fused to the coding region of the neomycin phosphotransferase gene. The construct employing pVcos7 requires transformation with an unlinked selectable marker, whereas pMV6tk/neo carries the neomycin resistance marker, which permits linked cotransformation. Neo<sup>+</sup> colonies of NIH 3T3 cells obtained after transformation were selected by their ability to grow in media containing the neomycin analogue G418, and were screened using the rosetting procedure to detect the expression of T4 on the cell surface. Approximately 50% of the G418 colonies obtained with pVcos7 and 75% of the colonies obtained with pMV6tk/neo were positive for T4 in this assay. Rosette-positive colonies were further analyzed by cytofluorometry to confirm that T4 is expressed on the transformed cell surface (FIG. 1).</p>Metabolic protein labeling experiments were performed which demonstrate that the T4<sup>+</sup> transformed fibroblast and the T lymphocyte express a T4 protein of identical molecular weight. Untransformed NIH 3T3 cells, T4<sup>+</sup> transformants and T lymphocytes were labeled for 12 hours in the presence of L-[<sup>35</sup> S]-methionine (41). The cells were detergent solubilized and the lysate was passed over lentil lectin columns to enrich for glycoproteins (42). The bound glycoprotein fraction was eluted and immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibodies directed against T4 (FIG. 5). Under reducing conditions, a glycoprotein migrating at a relative molecular mass of 55 kd is detected in extracts from T lymphocytes and two independent T4<sup>+</sup> transformants. This protein is not detected in control 3T3 fibroblasts. Under nonreducing conditions, a 51 kd glycoprotein is immunoprecipitated with anti-T4 in T cells and in the transformed fibroblasts.</p>These experiments demonstrate that the transformants express a 55 kd glycoprotein immunoprecipitated with anti-T4 which is identical in size to that expressed on the surface of T lymphocytes. Thus, Northern and Southern analyses using the isolated cDNA, taken together with the ability of this cDNA to confer the T4<sup>+</sup> phenotype to mouse fibroblasts, indicate that the entire coding sequence of the T cell surface protein T4 had been cloned.</p>Nucleotide Sequence of the T4 cDNA and the Deduced Protein SequenceThe complete nucleotide sequence of the T4 coding region was determined by sequencing both strands of the 3 kb cDNA insert using the dideoxy termination method (35, 36). The complete nucleotide sequence and the predicted protein sequence are shown in FIG. 6. The longest open reading frame begins at position 76 with a methionine codon surrounded by the initiation consensus sequence PurNNATGPur (61). This reading frame extends 1374 nucleotides, encoding a polypeptide containing 458 amino acids. The contiguity of this reading frame was confirmed by inserting this cDNA into the RNA expression vector pSP6 (40). RNA synthesized from this vector, when translated in vitro, directs the synthesis of an unmodified 51 kd protein, the precise molecular weight predicted from the nucleotide sequence (FIG. 7).</p>T4 is comprised of a leader sequence, four tandem variable-joining (VJ)-like regions, and a membrane-spanning domain each sharing homology with corresponding regions of different members of the immunoglobulin gene family (62, 63) (FIGS. 6 and 8). A stretch of hydrophobic residues, corresponding to a leader peptide predicted by a Kyte-Dolittle (64) hydropathicity plot, immediately follows the initiation codon. Although the exact position at which the native T4 protein is processed cannot be determined, it is contemplated that cleavage occurs just after the threonine at positions--1 based on known cleavage patterns (65). Therefore, the signal peptide contains 23 amino acids and the processed T4 protein consists of 435 residues.</p>Residues 1-94 of the mature protein share both amino acid and structural homology with the immunoglobulin light chain variable domain (FIG. 9A). The overall homology of this domain with immunoglobulin variable regions is 32%. Sequence comparison between the V regions of light chain immunoglobulins and the N-terminal V-like region (V1) of T4 demonstrates that eight out of 14 invariant residues are conserved (66). This domain contains two cysteine residues, separated by 67 amino acids, whose positions and spacing are analogous to that found in light chain immunoglobulins and related molecules (67). These cysteines may be capable of forming the conserved intrastr",
    "ural homology with immunoglobulin variable (V) domains and as members of the immunoglobulin supergene family. However, the N-terminal V-like domains of T4 and T8 are quite different: they share only 28% homology and are therefore less homologous to each other than each is to immunoglobulin light chains (FIG. 9A). Moreover, the regions of maximum conservation between T4 and T8 are also the regions of strongest homology to immunoglobulin and T cell receptor V regions. Thus, the immunoglobulin-like domains of these two molecules, although structurally similar, show significant sequence divergence consistent with the hypothesis that they recognize different molecules on different subsets of target cells.</p>The V-like region structural homology shared by the N-terminal domains of T4 and T8 may be of particular relevance to the functions of these proteins. Virtually all members of the immunoglobulin supergene family participate in the immune response (62). Moreover, the individual members of this family show a strong tendency to associate with each other to form dimers. This association is apparent in the interaction of the heavy and light chains of immunoglobulin, the alpha and beta chains of the T cell antigen receptor, \u03b2<sub>2</sub> -microglobulin and class I MHC proteins and the alpha and beta chains of class II MHC molecules. The T8 glycoprotein forms a disulphide bond with T6, a presumed MHC-like molecule, on the surface of thymocytes (82), and exists as multimers of the 32 kd subunit on peripheral T lymphocytes (83). The presence of four V-like domains in T4 indicates that these regions associate with one another as well as with specific ligands on the surface of other cells or viruses. These specific affinities of immunoglobulin-like molecules may be essential for the recognition functions of T4 and T8.</p>Evolution of T4In the immunoglobulin and T cell antigen receptor genes, the V and J exons are widely separated and become juxtaposed only after a somatic recombination event (62, 63). The T4 mRNA encodes four contiguous V- and J-like elements without the requirement for DNA recombination events. It is therefore possible that T4 reflects a more primitive gens that evolved before the emergence of rearrangement mechanisms. Further support for this derives from recent observations that the first V-like region of T4 (V1) is split by an intron not present in the V genes encoding either the immunoglobulins or T cell antigen receptors. Accumulating evidence suggests that it is far more likely for introns to be precisely removed during evolution that for introns to be inserted in-a previously intron-free environment. Thus, T4 may represent an ancestral immunoglobulin gene which underwent duplications, divergence, and rearrangement to generate the current immunoglobulin gene family. Although functional in a far more complex immune system at present, T4 may reflect receptors operative in more primitive cellular immune responses. Primitive immune respon",

The cells were incubated with the precipitated DNA for 6 hours at 37\u00b0 C. The DNA precipitate was removed and fresh media (DMEM, 5% Nu-Serum\u00ae (Collaborative Research, Inc., Lexington, Mass.)) was added to the dishes. The cells were trypsinized 16 hours later and seeded into three 100 mm dishes and maintained in the above media. Foci (approximately 50 per dish) appeared in 12-14 days. Eleven of the transformed foci were selected, expanded and then seeded at 5\u00d710<sup>5</sup> cells per 100 mm dish for selection in the above media plus 500 \u03bcg/ml GENETICIN\u00ae G418 (Gibco Laboratories, Grand Island, N.Y.). All 11 clones survived G418  selection (500 \u03bcg/ml) and were screened for H-ras (p21) levels by standard protein immunoblot analysis.</p>The clones which expressed the highest levels of p21 (approximately 2 ng p21/\u03bcg Triton-soluble protein) were assayed for expression of sT4. Confluent cultures were incubated for 18 hours with <sup>35</sup> S-labelled methionine and cysteine. Culture supernatants and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibodies specific for the T4 (OKT4, OKT4A) and the T8 (OKT8) receptors, polyclonal antibody specific for ras proteins, or nonspecific mouse IgG. A protein of about 45 kd, the predicted size of sT4, was specifically precipitated from the culture medium by both of the monoclonal antibodies directed against the T4 receptor. The sT4 band was not observed in cell lysates. As expected, p21 was precipitated from the cell but not from the culture supernatants. Subsequent quantitation shows, compared to purified sT4, these cells produce relatively low levels of sT4, i.e., approximately 100 fold lower than with CHO cells as described in Example 2B.</p>Expression of pST4DHFR in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells: DXB-11 cells, a DHFR deficient CHO cell line (104) were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation with 10 to 30 \u03bcg of pST4DHFR in the presence of 10 \u03bcg carrier DNA (NIH-3T3 genomic DNA), one day after seeding 60 mm dishes with 5\u00d710<sup>5</sup> cells. Cells were incubated with the DNA precipitate for 6 hours at 37\u00b0 C., the media was removed, and fresh media (F12, 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin) was added to the dishes. The media was changed again after 16 hours and the cells were incubated for another 24 hours. The cells were then trypsinized, seeded into three 100 mm dishes and selected in nucleoside-free media (F-12 without hypoxanthine and thymidine, 10% dialyzed FBS, and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin). Colonies (approximately 100 per dish) appeared in 7-10 days. Colonies from each dish were pooled, expanded and then seeded at 5\u00d710<sup>3</sup> and at 5\u00d710<sup>4</sup> cells per well in 24 well culture plate",

The precleared supernatant was incubated with 5 \u03bcg of OKT4, OKT4A and OKT8 (gift of P. Rao, Ortho Pharmaceuticals Corp., Raritan, N.J.), mouse IgG (Cooper Biomedical, Malvern, Pa.), or rabbit \u03b1-mouse IgG (Cooper Biomedical) for 30 min at 4\u00b0 C. OKT4, OKT4A, OKT8, mouse IgG, and rabbit \u03b1-mouse IgG were precipitated by incubation with 20 \u03bcl (packed volume) of protein A sepharose beads for 30 min. at 4\u00b0 C. Following precipitation, the beads were washed twice with 200 \u03bcl precipitation buffer and once with 200 \u03bcl precipitation buffer minus NP-40\u00ae and non-fat dry milk. The washed beads were boiled for 5 min. in 20 \u03bcl sample buffer (125 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 1.4M \u03b2-mercaptoethanol), and the supernatants were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Similar results were obtained with OKT4B, OKT4C, OKT4D, OKT4E, OKT4F and other Mabs specific for T4. These results suggest that the conformation of sT4 accurately mimics the surface domain of the T4 receptor.</p>To determine whether sT4 can associate with HIV gp120 and whether this association can inhibit the binding of HIV to T4 cells, approximately 5 micrograms of purified sT4 were absorbed to Sepharose beads coated with OKT4 or control antibody. The beads were then mixed with a lysate of <sup>35</sup> S-methionine labeled HIV. The complex of sT4 with OKT4 coprecipitates only the 120 kd envelope glycoprotein. No viral proteins are precipitated by OKT4 beads in the absence of sT4 or in the presence of control supernatants from the untransfected CHO cells. Furthermore, viral protein is not precipitated if Sepharose beads coated with control mouse immunoglobulin (isotype matched to OKT4) are incubated with sT4. These studies indicate that the sT4 obtained, which is free of other cell surface components present on the surface of T lymphocytes, is capable of specifically associating with the envelope glycoprotein of the AIDS virus.</p>Cytofluorometry was performed to demonstrate that the interaction of T4 with gp120 of intact HIV abolishes the binding of AIDS virus to the surface of T4<sup>+</sup> cells. T4<sup>+</sup> CEM cells were exposed to HIV in the presence or absence of sT4. Following viral absorption, the cells were washed, exposed to fluorescein conjugated anti-HIV antibody, and analyzed by flow cytometry (FIG. 17) (48). In the absence of sT4, HIV binds efficiently to T4<sup>+</sup> CEM cells. If HIV is preincubated with sT4, the binding of virus to T4<sup>+</sup> cells is abolished (FIG. 17). Ten nanograms of purified sT4 is sufficient to inhibit the binding of 100 nanograms of viral protein. If the envelope glycoprotein comprises 5% of the total viral protein, an estimated a 5:1 molar ratio of T4 to gp120 is capable of complete inhibition of HIV binding to T4<sup>+</sup> cells.</p>The ability of sT4 to inhibit the infection of T4<sup>+</sup> cells ",

At confluence, the cells were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) without Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> and the growth medium (Ham's F12 without hypoxanthine and thymidine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin and mtx at the selective concentration) was replaced with the same medium minus serum and mtx and plus 1\u00d7ITS (insulin, transferrin and selenium (Collaborative Research Inc.). After 24-48 hrs. the medium was removed and replaced with selective growth medium. Serum-free medium was then reapplied within 3-5 days and this cycle repeated indefinitely, i.e., for more than two months. CM was clarified by centrifugation at 8,000\u00d7g. A protease inhibitor PMSF (phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride) was added to 0.5 mM and the CM was concentrated about 10x fold by pressure membrane filtration. This concentrated CM was clairified by centrifugation at 2000\u00d7g and Aprotinin, protease inhibitor, (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, Mo.) was added to a final concentration of 5 \u03bcg/ml. The sample was processed directly or after storage at -70\u00b0 C.</p>Western Blot Analysis: Conditioned media from V1V2J4 producing CHO cells was concentrated and run on a 15% polyacrylamide reducing gel. Protein was transferred to nitrocellulose paper and probed with polyclonal antisera raised against a denatured E. coli derived T-4-NSI fusion molecule. This antisera specifically recognizes a V1V2J4 doublet migrating at approximately 25 KD. This corresponds to the predicted size of the V1V2J4 coding sequence after leader processing. The physical basis for the doublet is not known. It is not likely to result from the differences in N-linked glycosylation, since the two consensus sequences in T-4 for this glycosylation are not present in V1V2J4.</p>Immuno-epitopes: The monoclonal antibodies OKT-4 and OKT-4A, OKT4B, OKT4C, OKT4D, OKT4E and OKT4F specifically recognize surface epitopes on the native, membrane bound T-4 receptor (Rao, et al., Cell Immunol. 80:310(1983)). These antibodies are specific for the native conformation in that they will not bind to reduced, SDS-denatured protein in immuno-blot assays. It was shown that both antibodies specifically precipitate V1V2J4 from <sup>35</sup> S-labelled culture supernatants using the following immunoprecipitation procedure.</p>Cultures of V1V2J4 producing cells containing 1\u00d710<sup>6</sup> cells per 60 mm culture dish, were labelled for 16 hours at 37\u00b0 C. in 1.5 ml methionine and cysteine free F12 medium containing ITS, and 170 \u03bcCi/ml [<sup>35</sup> S]methionine and 30 \u03bcCi/ml [<sup>35</sup> S]cysteine (ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Costa Mesa, Calif.).
