    " added to assay plates using Echo dispensing technology (1.5 fold dilution and 20 points titration). 50 nL of each compound dilution was added to 50 \u00b5L of culture (5% haematocrit, 0.5% parasitaemia) and incubated for 72 h at 37\u00b0C (1% O2, 3% CO2, balance N2). Final concentrations of test compounds ranged from 50,000 nM to 15 nM, in 0.5% DMSO. On day 4, 10 \u00b5L SYBR green (Invitrogen S7563 supplied as 10,000 x concentrate in DMSO) pre-diluted to 3 x concentrate with Lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.9, 5% EDTA, 0.16% w/v, 1.6% TX100 v/v) was added to the cultures and incubated in the dark, overnight, at room temperature. On day 5, fluorescent signal was measured using a BioTek plate reader (excitation 485 nm, emission 528 nm). All data were processed using IDBS ActivityBase. Raw data were converted into per cent inhibition through linear regression by setting the high inhibition control (mefloquine) as 100% and the no inhibition control (DMSO) as 0%. \n\nQuality control criteria for passing plates were as follows: Z\u02b9 &gt; 0.5, S:B &gt; 3, %CV<sub>(no inhibition control)</sub> &lt; 15. The formula used to calculate Z\u02b9 is: \n\n where \u03bc denotes the mean; \u03c3 denotes the standard deviation; p denotes the positive control; and n denotes the negative control. All EC<sub>50</sub> curve fitting was undertaken using the following bi-phasic two site dose response using XLfit model 300 (IDBS): \n\n where A = 100 minus the top of the upper curve 1 and the bottom of lower curve; B = Hill slope; log(C) = IC50 concentration at lower site; log(D) = IC50 concentration at upper site; x = inhibitor concentration; and y = % inhibition. When tested in the P. falciparum 3D7 asexual blood stage assay as described above, the compounds of the accompanying Examples were found to exhibit the following IC<sub>50</sub> values. \n\n EXAMPLES Abbreviations DCM: dichloromethane EtOAc: ethyl acetate DMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide THF: tetrahydrofuran MeOH: methanol DMF: N,N-dimethylformamide DIPEA: N,N-diisopropylethylamine TFA: trifluoroacetic acid TFAA: trifluoroacetic anhydride EtOH: ethanol DAST: diethylaminosulfur trifluoride DEA: diethylamine TBAF: tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride EDCI: N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N\u02b9-ethylcarbodiimide T3P\u00ae: 2,4,6-tripropyl-1,3,5,2,4,6-trioxatriphosphorinane-2,4,6-trioxide solution \n\nh: hour M: mass r.t.: room temperature RT: retention time </p>DAD: Diode Array Detector </p>HPLC: High Performance Liquid Chromatography </p>LCMS: Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry </p>ESI: Electrospray Ionisation </p>VCD: Vibrational Circular Dichroism </p>Nomenclature </p>Compounds were named in accordance with IUPAC guidelines with the aid of Biovia Draw version 19.1. </p>The asterisk (*) - for example, in compounds designated (15*, 35*) - indicates compounds of known relative stereochemistry but unknown absolute stereochemistry. </p>Analytical Conditions </p>Method 1 </p>Column: Waters X Bridge C18, 2.1 x 30 mm, 2.5 pm </p>Injection Volume 5.0 L </p>Flow Rate 1.00 mL/minute </p>Detection: </p>MS - ESI+ m/z 150 to 800 </p"
