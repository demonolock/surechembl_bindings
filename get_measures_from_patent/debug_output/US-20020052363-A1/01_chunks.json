    "BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0001] The present invention relates to certain compounds that are useful for the inhibition of prenyl-protein transferases and the treatment of cancer. In particular, the invention relates to prenyl-protein transferase inhibitors which are efficacious in vivo as inhibitors of geranylgeranyl-protein transferase type I (GGTase-I) and that inhibit the cellular processing of both the H-Ras protein and the K4B-Ras protein. </p>[0002] Prenylation of proteins by prenyl-protein transferases represents a class of post-translational modification (Glomset, J. A., Gelb, M. H., and Farnsworth, C. C. (1990). Trends Biochem. Sci. 15, 139-142; Maltese, W. A. (1990). FASEB J. 4, 3319-3328). This modification typically is required for the membrane localization and function of these proteins. Prenylated proteins share characteristic C-terminal sequences including CAAX (C, Cys; A, an aliphatic amino acid; X, another amino acid), XXCC, or XCXC. Three post-translational processing steps have been described for proteins having a C-terminal CAAX sequence: addition of either a 15 carbon (farnesyl) or 20 carbon (geranylgeranyl) isoprenoid to the Cys residue, proteolytic cleavage of the last 3 amino acids, and methylation of the new C-terminal carboxylate (Cox, A. D. and Der, C. J. (1992a). Critical Rev. Oncogenesis 3:365-400; Newman, C. M. H. and Magee, A. I. (1993). Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1155:79-96). Some proteins may also have a fourth modification: palmitoylation of one or two Cys residues N-terminal to the famesylated Cys. While some mammalian cell proteins terminating in XCX",
    "eukemias. The protein products of these genes are defective in their GTPase activity and constitutively transmit a growth stimulatory signal. </p>[0007] The Ras protein is one of several proteins that are known to undergo post-translational modification. Farnesyl-protein transferase utilizes farnesyl pyrophosphate to covalently modify the Cys thiol group of the Ras CAAX box with a farnesyl group (Reiss et al., Cell, 62:81-88 (1990); Schaber et al., J. Biol. Chem., 265:14701-14704 (1990); Schafer et al., Science, 249:1133-1139 (1990); Manne et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 87:7541-7545 (1990)). </p>[0008] Ras must be localized to the plasma membrane for both normal and oncogenic functions. At least 3 post-translational modifications are involved with Ras membrane localization, and all 3 modifications occur at the C-terminus of Ras. The Ras C-terminus contains a sequence motif termed a \u201cCAAX\u201d or \u201cCys-Aaa<sup>1</sup>-Aaa<sup>2</sup>-Xaa\u201d box (Cys is cysteine, Aaa is an aliphatic amino acid, the Xaa is any amino acid) (Willumsen et al., Nature 310:583-586 (1984)). Depending on the specific sequence, this motif serves as a signal sequence for the enzymes farnesyl-protein transferase or geranylgeranyl-protein transferase, which catalyze the alkylation of the cysteine residue of the CAAX motif with a C<sub>15 </sub>or C<sub>20 </sub>isoprenoid, respectively. (S. Clarke., Ann. Rev. Biochem. 61:355-386 (1992); W. R. Schafer and J. Rine, Ann. Rev. Genetics 30:209-237 (1992)). Direct inhibition of farnesyl-protein transferase would be more specific and attended by fewer side effects than would occur with the required dose of a general inhibitor of isoprene biosynthesis. </p>[0009] Other famesylated proteins include the Ras-related GTP-binding proteins such as RhoB, fungal mating factors, the nuclear lamins, and the gamma subunit of transducin. James, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 269, 14182 (1994) have identified a peroxisome associated protein Pxf which is also farnesylated. James, et al., have also suggested that there are farnesylated proteins of unknown structure and function in addition to those listed above. </p>[0010] Inhibitors of farnesyl-protein transferase (FPTase) have been described in two general classes. The first class includes analogs of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), while the second is related to protein substrates (e.g., Ras) for the enzyme. The peptide derived inhibitors that have been described are generally cysteine containing molecules that are related to the CAAX motif that is the signal for protein prenylation. (Schaber et al., ibid; Reiss et. al., ibid; Reiss et al., PNAS, 88:732-736 (1991)). Such inhibitors may inhibit protein prenylation while serving as alternate substrates for the farnesyl-protein transferase enzyme, or may be purely competitive inhibitors (U.S. Pat. No. 5,141,851, University of Texas; N. E. Kohl et al., Science, 260:1934-1937 (1993); Graham, et al., J. Med. Chem., 37, 725 (1994)). </p>[0011] Mammalian cells express four types of Ras proteins (H-, N-, K4A-,and K4B-Ras) among which K4B-Ras is the most frequently mutated form of Ras in human cancers. The genes that encode these proteins are abbreviated H-ras, N-ras, K4A-ras and K4B-ras respectively. H-ras is an abbreviation for Harvey-ras. K4A-ras and K4B-ras are abbreviations for the Kirsten splice variants of ras that contain the 4A and 4B exons, respectively. Inhibition of farnesyl-protein transferase has been shown to block the growth of H-ras-transformed cells in soft agar and to modify other aspects of their transformed phenotype. It has also been demonstrated that certain inhibitors of farnesyl-protein transferase selectively block the processing of the H-Ras oncoprotein intracellularly (N. E. Kohl et al., Science, 260:1934-1937 (1993) and G. L. James et al., Science, 260:1937-1942 (1993). Recently, it has been shown that an inhibitor of farnesyl-protein transferase blocks the growth of H-ras-dependent tumors in nude mice (N. E. Kohl et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U.S.A., 91:9141-9145 (1994) and induces regression of mammary and salivary carcinomas in H-ras transgenic mice (N. E. Kohl et al., Nature Medicine, 1:792-797 (1995). </p>[0012] Indirect inhibition of farnesyl-protein transferase in vivo has been demonstrated with lovastatin (Merck &amp; Co., Rahway, N.J.) and compactin (Hancock et al., ibid; Casey et al., ibid; Schafer et al., Science 245:379 (1989)). These drugs inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, the rate limiting enzyme for the production of poly-isoprenoids including farnesyl pyrophosphate. Inhibition of farnesyl pyrophosphate biosynthesis by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase blocks Ras membrane localization in cultured cells. </p>[0013] It has been disclosed that the lysine-rich region and terminal CVIM sequence of the C-terminus of K-RasB confer resistance to inhibition of the cellular processing of that protein by certain selective FPTase inhibitors. (James, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270, 6221 (1995) Those FPTase inhibitors were effective in inhibiting the processing of H-Ras proteins. James et al., suggested that prenylation of the K4B-Ras protein by GGTase-I contributed to the resistance to the selective FPTase inhibitors. </p>[0014] Selective inhibitors of GGTase-I have been previously disclosed (see for example U.S. Pat. No. 5,470,832, issued Nov. 28, 1995). Other compounds have been described as selective inhibitors of GGTase-I (see for example PCT Publication No. WO 96/21456). Combinations of a selective inhibitor of FPTase and a selective inhibitor of GGTase-I have been disclosed as useful in the treatment of cancer (PCT Publication No. WO 97/34664). </p>[0015] Several groups of scientists have recently disclosed compounds that are non-selective FPTase/GGTase-I inhibitors. (Nagasuet al. Cancer Research, 55:5310-5314 (1995); PCT application WO 95/25086). </p>[0016] It is the object of the instant invention to provide a prenyl-protein transferase inhibitor which is efficacious in vivo as an inhibitor of geranylgeranyl-protein transferase type I (GGTase-I), also known as CAAX GGTase. </p>[0017] It is also the object of the present invention to provide a compound which inhibits the cellular processing of both the H-Ras protein and the K4B-Ras protein. </p>[0018] It is also the object of the present invention to provide a compound which is efficacious in vivo as an inhibitor of the growth of cancer cells characterized by a mutated K4B-Ras protein. </p>[0019] A composition which comprises such an inhibitor compound is used in the present invention to treat cancer. </p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0020] The present invention comprises piperazine-containing compounds which inhibit prenyl-protein transferases.

These compounds may be administered to patients for use in the treatment of cancer. Examples of the type of cancer which may be treated with the compounds of this invention include, but are not limited to, colorectal carcinoma, exocrine pancreatic carcinoma, myeloid leukemias and neurological tumors. Such tumors may arise by mutations in the ras genes themselves, mutations in the proteins that can regulate Ras activity (i.e., neurofibromin (NF-1), neu, src, ab1, lck, fyn) or by other mechanisms. </p>[0516] The compounds of the instant invention inhibit prenyl-protein transferase and the prenylation of the oncogene protein Ras. The instant compounds may also inhibit tumor angiogenesis, thereby affecting the growth of tumors (J. Rak et al. Cancer Research, 55: 4575-4580 (1995)). Such antiangiogenesis properties of the instant compounds may also be useful in the treatment of certain forms of vision deficit related to retinal vascularization. </p>[0517] The compounds of this invention are also useful for inhibiting other proliferative diseases, both benign and malignant, wherein Ras proteins are aberrantly activated as a result of oncogenic mutation in other genes (i.e., the Ras gene itself is not activated by mutation to an oncogenic form) with said inhibition being accomplished by the administration of an effective amount of the compounds of the invention to a mammal in need of such treatment. For example, a component of NF-1 is a benign proliferative disorder. </p>[0518] The instant compounds may also be useful in the treatment of certain viral infections, in particular in the treatment of hepatitis delta and related viruses (J. S. Glenn et al. Science, 256:1331-1333 (1992). </p>[0519] The compounds of the instant invention are also useful in the prevention of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty by inhibiting neointimal formation (C.

Isoprenyl-protein transferase activity assays are carried out at 30\u00b0 C. unless noted otherwise. A typical reaction contains (in a final volume of 50 \u03bcL): [<sup>3</sup>H]farnesyl diphosphate, Ras protein, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 10 \u03bcM ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1% polyethyleneglycol (PEG) (15,000-20,000 mw) and isoprenyl-protein transferase. The FPTase employed in the assay is prepared by recombinant expression as described in Omer, C. A., Kral, A. M., Diehl, R. E., Prendergast, G. C., Powers, S., Allen, C. M., Gibbs, J. B. and Kohl, N. E. (1993) Biochemistry 32:5167-5176. After thermally pre-equilibrating the assay mixture in the absence of enzyme, reactions are initiated by the addition of isoprenyl-protein transferase and stopped at timed intervals (typically 15 min) by the addition of 1 M HCl in ethanol (1 mL). The quenched reactions are allowed to stand for 15 m (to complete the precipitation process). After adding 2 mL of 100% ethanol, the reactions are vacuum-filtered through Whatman GF/C filters. Filters are washed four times with 2 mL aliquots of 100% ethanol, mixed with scintillation fluid (10 mL) and then counted in a Beckman LS3801 scintillation counter. </p>[0620] For inhibition studies, assays are run as described above, except inhibitors are prepared as concentrated solutions in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide and then diluted 20-fold into the enzyme assay mixture. Substrate concentrations for inhibitor IC<sub>50 </sub>determinations are as follows: FTase, 650 nM Ras-CVLS (SEQ.ID.NO.: 1), 100 nM farnesyl diphosphate. </p>[0621] The compounds of the instant invention described in the above Examples 1-18 were tested for inhibitory activity against human FPTase by the assay described above and were found to have an IC<sub>50 </sub>of \u22665 \u03bcM. </p>Example 20 Modified In Vitro GGTase Inhibition Assay [0622] The modified geranylgeranyl-protein transferase inhibition assay is carried out at room temperature. A typical reaction contains (in a final volume of 50 \u03bcL): [<sup>3</sup>H]geranylgeranyl diphosphate, biotinylated Ras peptide, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, a modulating anion (for example 19 mM glycerophosphate or 5 mM ATP), 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 \u03bcM ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1% PEG (15,000-20,000 mw), 2 mM dithiothreitol, and geranylgeranyl-protein transferase type I (GGTase). The GGTase-type I enzyme employed in the assay is prepared as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,470,832, incorporated by reference. The Ras peptide is derived from the K4B-Ras protein and has the following sequence: biotinyl-GKKKKKKSKTKCVIM (single amino acid code) (SEQ.ID.NO.: 2). Reactions are initiated by the addition of GGTase and stopped at timed intervals (typically 15 min) by the addition of 200 \u03bcL of a 3 mg/mL suspension of streptavidin SPA beads (Scintillation Proximity Assay beads, Amersham) in 0.2 M sodium phosphate, pH 4, containing 50 mM EDTA, and 0.5% BSA.

Enzyme and substrate concentrations for inhibitor IC<sub>50 </sub>determinations are as follows: 75 pM GGTase-I, 1.6 \u03bcM Ras peptide, 100 nM geranylgeranyl diphosphate. </p>[0624] The compounds of the instant invention described in the above were tested for inhibitory activity against human GGTase-type I by the assay described above and were found to have an IC<sub>50 </sub>of \u22665 \u03bcM. </p>Example 21 Cell-based In Vitro Ras Famesylation Assay [0625] The cell line used in this assay is a v-ras line derived from either Rat1 or NIH3T3 cells, which expressed viral Ha-ras p21. The assay is performed essentially as described in DeClue, J. E. et al., Cancer Research 51:712-717, (1991). Cells in 10 cm dishes at 50-75% confluency are treated with the test compound (final concentration of solvent, methanol or dimethyl sulfoxide, is 0.1%). After 4 hours at 37\u00b0 C., the cells are labeled in 3 mL methionine-free DMEM supplemented with 10% regular DMEM, 2% fetal bovine serum and 400 \u03bcCi[<sup>35</sup>S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol). After an additional 20 hours, the cells are lysed in 1 mL lysis buffer (1% NP40/20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5/5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>/1 mM DTT/10 mg/mL aprotinen/2 mg/mL leupeptin/2 mg/mL antipain/0.5 mM PMSF) and the lysates cleared by centrifugation at 100,000\u00d7g for 45 min. Aliquots of lysates containing equal numbers of acid-precipitable counts are bought to 1 mL with IP buffer (lysis buffer lacking DTT) and immunoprecipitated with the ras-specific monoclonal antibody Y13-259 (Furth, M. E. et al., J. Virol. 43:294-304, (1982)). Following a 2 hour antibody incubation at 4\u00b0 C., 200 \u03bcl of a 25% suspension of protein A-Sepharose coated with rabbit anti rat IgG is added for 45 min. The immunoprecipitates are washed four times with IP buffer (20 nM HEPES, pH 7.5/1 mM EDTA/1% Triton X-100.0.5% deoxycholate/0.1%/SDS/0.1 M NaCl) boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and loaded on 13% acrylamide gels. When the dye front reached the bottom, the gel is fixed, soaked in Enlightening, dried and autoradiographed. The intensities of the bands corresponding to famesylated and nonfarnesylated ras proteins are compared to determine the percent inhibition of farnesyl transfer to protein. </p>Example 22 Cell-based In Vitro Growth Inhibition Assay [0626] To determine the biological consequences of FPTase inhibition, the effect of the compounds of the instant invention on the anchorage-independent growth of Rat1 cells transformed with either a v-ras, v-raf, or v-mos oncogene is tested. Cells transformed by v-Raf and v-Mos maybe included in the analysis to evaluate the specificity of instant compounds for Ras-induced cell transformation. </p>[0627] Rat1 cells transformed with either v-ras, v-raf, or v-mos are seeded at a density of 1\u00d710<sup>4 </sup>cells per plate (35 mm in diameter) in a 0.3% top agarose layer in medium A (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum) over a bottom agarose layer (0.6%). Both layers contain 0.1% methanol or an appropriate concentration of the instant compound (dissolved in methanol at 1000 times the final concentration used in the assay). The cells are fed twice weekly with 0.5 mL of medium A containing 0.1% methanol or the concentration of the instant compound. Photomicrographs are taken 16 days after the cultures are seeded and comparisons are made. </p>Example 23 Construction of SEAP Reporter Plasmid pDSE100 [0628] The SEAP reporter plasmid, pDSE100 was constructed by ligating a restriction fragment containing the SEAP coding sequence into the plasmid pCMV-RE-AKI.

Next, 100 \u03bcl of media containing the secreted alkaline phosphatase is removed from each well and transferred to a microtube array for heat treatment at 65\u00b0 C. for 1 hr to inactivate endogenous alkaline phosphatases (but not the heat stable secreted phosphatase). </p>[0655] The heat treated media is assayed for alkaline phosphatase by a luminescence assay using the luminescence reagent CSPD\u00ae (Tropix, Bedford, Mass.). A volume of 50 \u03bcl media is combined with 200 \u03bcl of CSPD cocktail and incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature. Luminesence is monitored using an ML2200 microplate luminometer (Dynatech). Luminescence reflects the level of activation of the fos reporter construct stimulated by the transiently expressed protein.  \nDNA-CaPO<sub>4 </sub>precipitate for 10 cm. plate of cellsRas expression plasmid (1 \u03bcg/\u03bcl)10\u03bclDSE-SEAP Plasmid (1 \u03bcg/\u03bcl)2\u03bclSheared Calf Thymus DNA (1 \u03bcg/\u03bcl)8\u03bcl2M CaCl<sub>2</sub>74\u03bcldH<sub>2</sub>O506\u03bcl2X HBS Buffer280 mM NaCl10 mM KCl1.5 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4 </sub>2H<sub>2</sub>O12 mM dextrose50 mM HEPESFinal pH = 7.05Luminesence Buffer (26 ml)Assay Buffer20mlEmerald Reagent\u2009\u2122 (Tropix)2.5ml100 mM homoarginine2.5mlCSPD Reagent\u2009\u00ae (Tropix)1.0ml\n</p>Assay Buffer [0656] Add 0.05 M Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>to 0.05M NaHCO3 to obtain pH 9.5. </p>[0657] Make 1 mM in MgCl<sub>2 </sub></p>Example 24 The Processing Assays Employed are Modifications of that Described by DeClue et al [Cancer Research 51, 712-717, 1991]. K4B-Ras processing inhibition assay [0658] PSN-1 (human pancreatic carcinoma) or viral-K4B-ras-transformed Rat 1 cells are used for analysis of protein processing. Subconfluent cells in 100 mm dishes are fed with 3.5 mL of media (methionine-free RPMI supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum or cysteine-free/methionine-free DMEM supplemented with 0.035 mL of 200 mM glutamine (Gibco), 2% fetal bovine serum, respectively) containing the desired concentration of test compound, lovastatin or solvent alone. Cells treated with lovastatin (5-10 \u03bcM), a compound that blocks Ras processing in cells by inhibiting a rate-limiting step in the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway, serve as a positive control. Test compounds are prepared as 1000\u00d7 concentrated solutions in DMSO to yield a final solvent concentration of 0.1%. Following incubation at 37\u00b0 C. for two hours 204 \u03bcCi/mL [<sup>35</sup>S]Pro-Mix (Amersham, cell labeling grade) is added. </p>[0659] After introducing the label amino acid mixture, the cells are incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for an additional period of time (typically 6 to 24 hours). The media is then removed and the cells are washed once with cold PBS. The cells are scraped into 1 mL of cold PBS, collected by centrifugation (10,000\u00d7g for 10 sec at room temperature), and lysed by vortexing in 1 mL of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM DTT, 10 \u03bcg/mL AEBSF, 10 \u03bcg/mL aprotinin, 2 \u03bcg/mL leupeptin and 2 \u03bcg/mL antipain). The lysate is the",
    "ht to 1 mL with lysis buffer lacking DTT and 8 \u03bcg of the pan Ras monoclonal antibody, Y13-259, added. The protein/antibody mixture is incubated on ice at 4\u00b0 C. for 24 hours. The immune complex is collected on pansorbin (Calbiochem) coated with rabbit antiserum to rat IgG (Cappel) by tumbling at 4\u00b0 C. for 45 minutes. The pellet is washed 3 times with 1 mL of lysis buffer lacking DTT and protease inhibitors and resuspended in 100 \u03bcl elution buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 1% SDS). The Ras is eluted from the beads by heating at 95\u00b0 C. for 5 minutes, after which the beads are pelleted by brief centrifugation (15,000\u00d7g for 30 sec. at room temperature). </p>[0661] The supernatant is added to 1 mL of Dilution Buffer 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris pH 7.4) with 2 \u03bcg Kirsten-ras specific monoclonal antibody, c-K-ras Ab-1 (Calbiochem). The second protein/antibody mixture is incubated on ice at 4\u00b0 C. for 1-2 hours. The immune complex is collected on pansorbin (Calbiochem) coated with rabbit antiserum to rat IgG (Cappel) by tumbling at 4\u00b0 C. for 45 minutes. The pellet is washed 3 times with 1 mL of lysis buffer lacking DTT and protease inhibitors and resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. The Ras is eluted from the beads by heating at 95\u00b0 C. for 5 minutes, after which the beads are pelleted by brief centrifugation. The supernatant is subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 12% acrylamide gel (bis-acrylamide:acrylamide, 1:100), and the Ras visualized by fluorography. </p>hDJ Processing Inhibition Assay [0662] PSN-1 cells are seeded in 24-well assay plates. For each compound to be tested, the cells are treated with a minimum of seven concentrations in half-log steps. The final solvent (DMSO) concentration is 0.1%. A vehicle-only control is included on each assay plate. The cells are treated for 24 hours at 37\u00b0 C./5% CO<sub>2</sub>. </p>[0663] The growth media is then aspirated and the samples are washed with PBS. The cells are lysed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 5% 2-mercapto-ethanol and heated to 95\u00b0 C. for 5 minutes. After cooling on ice for 10 minutes, a mixture of nucleases is added to reduce viscosity of the samples. </p>[0664] The plates are incubated on ice for another 10 minutes. The samples are loaded onto pre-cast 8% acrylamide gels and electrophoresed at 15 mA/gel for 3-4 hours. The samples are then transferred from the gels to PVDF membranes by Western blotting. </p>[0665] The membranes are blocked for at least 1 hour in buffer containing 2% nonfat dry milk. The membranes are then treated with a monoclonal antibody to hDJ-2 (Neomarkers Cat. # MS-225), washed, and treated with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. The membranes are then treated with a fluorescent detection reagent and scanned on a phosphorimager. </p>[0666] For each sample, the percent of total signal corresponding to the unprenylated species of hDJ (the slower-migrating species) is calculated by densitometry. Dose-response curves and EC<sub>50 </sub>values are generated using 4-parameter curve fits in SigmaPlot software. </p>Example 25 Rap1 Processing Inhibition Assay Protocol A: [0667] Cells are labeled, incubated and lysed as described in Example 24. </p>[0668] For immunoprecipitation of Rap1, samples of lysate supernatant containing equal amounts of protein are utilized. Protein concentration is determined by the bradford method utilizing bovine serum albumin as a standard. The appropriate volume of lysate is brought to 1 mL with lysis buffer lacking DTT and 2 \u03bcg of the Rap1 antibody, Rap1/Krev1 (121) (Santa Cruz Biotech), is added. The protein/antibody mixture is incubated on ice at 4\u00b0 C. for 1 hour. The immune complex is collected on pansorbin (Calbiochem) by tumbling at 4\u00b0 C. for 45 minutes. The pellet is washed 3 times with 1 mL of lysis buffer lacking DTT and protease inhibitors and resuspended in 100 \u03bcl elution buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 1% SDS). The Rap1 is eluted from the beads by heating at 95\u00b0 C. for 5 minutes, after which the beads are pelleted by brief centrifugation (15,000\u00d7g for 30 sec. at room temperature). </p>[0669] The supernatant is added to 1 mL of Dilution Buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris pH 7.4) with 2 \u03bcg Rap1 antibody, Rap1/Krev1 (121) (Santa Cruz Biotech). The second protein/antibody mixture is incubated on ice at 4\u00b0 C. for 1-2 hours. The immune complex is collected on pansorbin (Calbiochem) by tumbling at 4\u00b0 C. for 45 minutes. The pellet is washed 3 times with 1 mL of lysis buffer lacking DTT and protease inhibitors and resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. The Rap1 i",
    "final concentrations to be assayed is generally 0.1-100 \u03bcM. Four concentrations per compound is typical. The compounds are diluted so that each concentration is 1000\u00d7 of the final concentration (i.e., for a 10 \u03bcM data point, a 10 mM stock of the compound is needed). </p>[0673] 2 \u03bcL of each 1000\u00d7 compound stock is diluted into 1 ml media to produce a 2\u00d7 stock of compound. A vehicle control solution (2 \u03bcL DMSO to 1 ml media), is utilized. 0.5 mL of the 2\u00d7 stocks of compound are added to the cells. </p>[0674] After 24 hours, the media is aspirated from the assay plates. Each well is rinsed with 1 ml PBS, and the PBS is aspirated. 180 \u03bcL SDS-PAGE sample buffer (Novex) containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol is added to each well. The plates are heated to 1 00\u00b0 C. for 5 minutes using a heat block containing an adapter for assay plates. The plates are placed on ice. After 10 minutes, 20\u03bcL of an RNAse/DNase mix is added per well. This mix is 1 mg/mL DNaseI (Worthington Enzymes), 0.25 mg/mL Rnase A (Worthington Enzymes), 0.5 M Tris-HCl pH8.0 and 50 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. The plate is left on ice for 10 minutes. Samples are then either loaded on the gel, or stored at \u221270\u00b0 C. until use. </p>[0675] Each assay plate (usually 3 compounds, each in 4-point titrations, plus controls) requires one 15-well 14% Novex gel. 25 \u03bcl of each sample is loaded onto the gel. The gel is run at 15 mA for about 3.5 hours. It is important to run the gel far enough so that there will be adequate separation between 21 kd (Rap1) and 29 kd (Rab6). </p>[0676] The gels are then transferred to Novex pre-cut PVDF membranes for 1.5 hours at 30V (constant voltage). Immediately after transferring, the membranes are blocked overnight in 20 ml Western blocking buffer (2% nonfat dry milk in Western wash buffer (PBS+0.1% Tween-20). If blocked over the weekend, 0.02% sodium azide is added. The membranes are blocked at 4\u00b0 C. with slow rocking. </p>[0677] The blocking solution is discarded and 20 ml fresh blocking solution containing the anti Rap1a antibody (Santa Cruz Biochemical SC1482) at 1:1000 (diluted in Western blocking buffer) and the anti Rab6 antibody (Santa Cruz Bio-chemical SC310) at 1:5000 (diluted in Western blocking buffer) are added. The membranes are incubated at room temperature for 1 hour with mild rocking. The blocking solution is then discarded and the membrane is washed 3 times with Western wash buffer for 15 minutes per wash. 20 ml blocking solution containing 1:1000 (diluted in Western blocking buffer) each of two alkaline phosphatase conjugated antibodies (Alkaline phosphatase conjugated Anti-goat IgG and Alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-rabbit IgG [Santa Cruz Biochemical]) is then added. The membrane is incubated for one hour and washed 3\u00d7as above. </p>[0678] About 2 ml per gel of the Amersham ECF detection reagent is placed on an overhead transparency (ECF) and the PVDF membranes are placed face-down onto the detection reagent. This is incubated for one minute, then the membrane is placed onto a fresh transparency sheet. </p>[0679] The developed transparency sheet is scanned on a phosphorimager and the Rap1a Minimum Inhibitory Concentration is determined from the lowest concentration of compound that produces a detectable Rap1a Western signal. The Rap1a antibody used recognizes only unprenylated/unprocessed Rap1a, so that the precence of a detectable Rap1a Western signal is indicative of inhibition of Rap1a prenylation. </p>Protocol C [0680] This protocol allows the determination of an EC<sub>50 </sub>for inhibition of processing of Rap1a. The assay is run as described in Protocol B with the following modifications. 20 \u03bcl of sample is run on pre-cast 10-20% gradient acrylamide mini gels (Novex Inc.) at 15 mA/gel for 2.5-3 hours. Prenylated and unprenylated forms of Rap1a are detected by blotting with a polyclonal antibody (Rap1/Krev-1 Ab#121; Santa Cruz Research Products #sc-65), followed by an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody. The percentage of unprenylated Rap1a relative to the total amount of Rap1a is determined by peak integration using Imagequant\u00ae software (Molecular Dynamics). Unprenylated Rap1a is distinguished from prenylated protein by virtue of the greater apparent molecular weight of the prenylated protein. Dose-response curves and EC<sub>50 </sub>values are generated using 4-parameter curve fits in SigmaPlot software. </p>Example 26 In vivo Tumor Growth Inhibition Assay (nude mouse) [0681] In vivo efficacy as an inhibitor of the growth of cancer cells may be confirmed by several protocols well known in the art. Examples of such in vivo efficacy studies are described by N. E. Kohl et al. (Nature Medicine, 1:792-797 (1995)) and N. E. Kohl et al. (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 91:9141-9145 (1994)). </p>[0682] Rodent fibroblasts transformed with oncogenically mutated human Ha-ras or Ki-ras (10<sup>6 </sup>cells/animal in 1 mL of DMEM salts) are injected subcutaneously into the left flank of 8-12 week old female nude mice (Harlan) on day 0. The mice in each oncogene group are randomly assigned to a vehicle, compound or combination treatment group. Animals are dosed subcutaneously starting on day 1 and daily for the duration of the experiment. Alternatively, the farnesyl-protein transferase inhibitor may be administered by a continuous infusion pump. Compound, compound combination or vehicle is delivered in a total volume of 0.1 mL. Tumors are excised and weighed when all of the vehicle-treated animals exhibited lesions of 0.5 - 1.0 cm in diameter, typically 11-15 days after the cells were injected. The average weight of the tumors in each treatment group for each cell line is calculated. </p>121 1 4 PRT Artificial Sequence completely synthetic sequence  1 \n\nCys Val Leu Ser \n 1 \n\n2 15 PRT Artificial Sequence completely synthetic sequence  2 \n\nGly Lys Lys Lys Lys Lys Lys Ser Lys Thr Lys Cys Val Ile Met \n 1               5                  10                  15 \n\n3 52 DNA Artificial Sequence completely synthetic sequence  3 \n\ngagagggaat tcgggccctt cctgcatgct gctgctgctg ctgctgctgg gc             52 \n\n4 41 DNA Artificial Sequence completely synthetic sequence  4 \n\ngagagagctc gaggttaacc cgggtgcgcg gcgtcggtgg t                         41 \n\n5 42 DNA Artificial Sequence completely synthetic sequence  5 \n\ngagagagtct agagttaacc cgtggtcccc gcgttgcttc ct             "
