    "t least 1 year for at least about 2 years. Furthermore, the formulation is preferably stable following freezing (to, e.g., -70\u00b0C) and thawing of the formulation.</p>A protein \"retains its physical stability\" in a pharmaceutical formulation if it shows no signs of aggregation, precipitation and/or denaturation upon visual examination of color and/or clarity, or as measured by UV light scattering or by size exclusion chromatography.</p>A protein \"retains its chemical stability\" in a pharmaceutical formulation, if the chemical stability at a given time is such that the protein is considered to still retain its biological activity as defined below. Chemical stability can be assessed by detecting and quantifying chemically altered forms of the protein. Chemical alteration may involve size modification (e.g., clipping) that can be evaluated using size exclusion chromatography, SDS-PAGE and/or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI/TOF MS), for example. Other types of chemical alteration include charge alteration (e.g., occurring as a result of deamidation) that can be evaluated by, e.g., ion-exchange chromatography.</p>An immunoglobulin \"retains its biological activity\" in a pharmaceutical formulation, if the biological activity of the immunoglobulin at a given time is within about 10% (within the errors of the assay) of the biological activity exhibited at the time the pharmaceutical formulation was prepared as determined in an antigen-binding assay, for example.</p>5.7 Routes of Administration of Immunoglobulin CompositionsThe pharmaceutical compositions discussed supra can be administered for diagnosis, prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatments of inflammatory bowel diseases, asthma, multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), graft versus host disease (GVHD), host versus graft disease, and various spondyloarthropathies. In therapeutic applications, compositions are administered to a patient suspected of, or already suffering from a disease, in an amount sufficient to provide treatment. An amount adequate to accomplish this is defined as a therapeutically or pharmaceutically effective dose.</p>The pharmaceutical compositions will be administered by parenteral, topical, intravenous, oral, or subcutaneous, intramuscular local administration, such as by aerosol or transdermally, for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatment. Although the proteinaceous substances of this invention may survive passage through the gut following oral administration (p.o.), subcutaneous (s.c.), intravenous (i.v.), intramuscular (i.m.), intraperitoneal administration by depot injection; or by implant preparation are preferred.</p>The pharmaceutical compositions can be administered in a variety of unit dosage forms depending upon the method of administration. For example, unit dosage forms suitable for oral administration include powder, tablets, pills, capsules, and lozenges.</p>Effective doses of the compositions of the ",
    "e. In patients with multiple sclerosis in remission, risk may be assessed by NMR imaging or, in some cases, by pre-symptomatic indications observed by the patient.</p>Effective dosage regimes of the compositions of the present invention, for the treatment of the above described conditions will vary depending upon many different factors, including means of administration, target site, physiological state of the patient, and other medicaments administered. Thus, treatment dosages will need to be titrated to optimize safety and efficacy. In general, each administration of the dosage regimen will range from 0.0001 to 100 mg/kg, usually 0.01 to 50, and more usually from 0.1 to 30 mg/kg of the host body weight.</p>8.0 Testing ReagentsIn general, reagents can be tested in vitro and in vivo. Many in vitro models exist to test whether a reagent binds to the \u03b1<sub>4</sub> subunit, as would be known in the art. Testing whether a reagent has activity in vivo at diagnosis and/or treatment of inflammatory bowel conditions, as well as other inflammatory conditions, can be performed using the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) animal model. EAE is an inflammatory condition of the central nervous system with similarities to multiple sclerosis (Paterson, IN TEXTBOOK OF IMMUNOPATHOLOGY, eds. Miescher and Mueller-Eberhard, 179-213, Grune and Stratton, N.Y. 1976).</p>Sections of EAE brain can be tested for their ability to support leukocyte attachment using, for example, an in vitro binding assay described in Stamper and Woodruff, J. Exp. Med. 144: 828-833 (1976). Reagents against leukocyte adhesion receptors can be examined for inhibitory activity in the in vitro section assay. The attachment of U937 cells (a human monocytic cell line) is almost completely blocked by antibodies against human VLA-4 integrin. The antibody of the present invention produced significantly greater blocking effect as compared to antibodies against other adhesion molecules.</p>In general, antibodies that selectively inhibit the fibronectin binding activity of \u03b1<sub>4</sub> integrin (P4G9 and HP1/7) enhanced U937 attachment to the EAE vessels. These results suggest that fibronectin-binding activity of \u03b1<sub>4</sub> integrin is not directly involved in U937 adhesion to EAE vessels in vitro. Given the in vitro results using the \u03b1<sub>4</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub> reagents described above, the effect of these antibodies on the progression of EAE can also be tested in vivo by measuring the delay in the onset of paralysis or reduction in severity of the paralysis.</p>In general, additional reagents can be identified by use of adhesion assays. Using HP2/1 or N-[N-(3-pyridinesulfonyl)-L-3,3-dimethyl-4-thiaprolyl]-O-[1-methylpiperazin-4-ylcarbonyl]-L-tyrosine isopropyl ester as a control for example, other antibodies or reagents can be screened for their ability to inhibit the binding of lymphocytes to a known ligand for \u03b1<sub>4</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub> integrin.</p>Monoclonal antibodies are for examp"
