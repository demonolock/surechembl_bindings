    "ffective in \n\n enhancing sensitivity of cancer cells. Co-administration may be simultaneous or non-simultaneous administration. A liposome or peptide of the invention may be administered along with other therapeutic agents, during the course of a treatment regimen. In one embodiment, administration of a liposome or peptide of the invention and other therapeutic agents is sequential. An appropriate time course may be chosen by the physician, according to such factors as the nature of a patient's illness and the patient's condition.</p>Diagnostic Methods</p>[0168] Detection of disease-specific biomarkers provides an effective screening strategy. Early detection provides not only early diagnosis, but in the case of cancer, can provide the ability to screen for polymorphism and detect post-operative residual tumor cells and occult metastases, an early indicator of tumor recurrence. Early detection of disease-specific biomarkers can thus improve survival in patients before diagnosis, while undergoing treatment, and while in remission.</p>[0169] The peptides of the invention can be used as a diagnostic or prognostic for diseases. The peptides can be used as diagnostics in a number of ways, including but not limited to ELISA, Western blot, fluorescence, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, or autoradiography.</p>[0170] The antibodies of the present invention can also be used in combination with the peptides of the invention to detect cancer. In some embodiments, the assay is a binding assay that detects binding of an antibody with a peptide of the invention that has bound cancer cell. The subject polypeptide or antibody can be immobilized, while the subject polypeptide and/or antibody can be detectably labeled. For example, the antibody can be directly labeled or detected with a labeled secondary antibody. That is, suitable detectable labels for antibodies include direct labels, which label the antibody to the protein of interest, and \n\n indirect labels, which label an antibody that recognizes the antibody to the protein of interest, hi another embodiment, the peptide comprises a label, and the binding of the peptide to a tissue is detected by assaying for the presence of the label.</p>Screening Methods</p>[0171] The invention provides a methods for identifying biological ligands that bind to peptides of the invention.</p>[0172] In one method, the peptides of the invention can be used as \"bait proteins\" in a two-hybrid assay or three-hybrid assay (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,283,317; Zervos et al. (1993) Cell 72:223-232; Madura et al. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268:12046-12054; Bartel et al. (1993) Biotechniques 14:920-924; Iwabuchi et al. (1993) Oncogene 8:1693-1696; and Suter et al. (2006) Biotechniques 40:625-44 to identify other proteins, which bind to or interact with peptides of the invention.</p>[0173] In another method, peptides of the invention are incubated with cellular extracts and molecules that bind to peptides of the invention are identifi",
    "night and then suspended in PBS containing 50 mM EDTA and blocked with blocking buffer at 4\u00b0C for 30 minutes. The cells were washed 2 times with \n\n flow buffer (PBS containing 1% fetal bovine serum). The cells were incubated with phages or FITC-labeled peptide. For the peptide competitive inhibition assay, the phages were mixed with different concentrations of synthetic peptides and the mixture was incubated with the cells. After washing two times with cold flow buffer, the phage-bound cells were incubated with anti-M13 monoclonal antibodies at 4\u00b0C for 1 h and then treated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody. The cells were washed two times with cold flow buffer and then applied to a flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). [0188] The results showed that 42.6% of CLl-5 cells could be bound by the PC5-2</p>(Fig. 2C, c) and the bound phage was completely inhibited by the SP5-2 peptide (Fig. 2C, d). PC5-2 could not bind to SAS and normal epithelial cells (NNM) (Fig. 2C, e and f). PC5-2 also could not bind to NPC-TWOl by this assay (Fig. 2C, b). These results indicate that part of CLl -5 cells express an unknown protein or other molecule that could be recognized by the peptide ligand displayed on PC5-2.</p>Example 3. Binding of targeting peptide with NSCLC cells and lung cancer biopsies</p>[0189] To determine if the peptide sequences displayed on the PC5-2 indeed interacted with the NSCLC cells, we used FITC-labeled SP5-2 peptide in place of the PC5-2 phage for a peptide-binding assay using immunofluorescent staining. The results showed that the FITC-labeled SP5-2 specifically bound to the different NSCLC cell lines including CLl -5, H460, A549, PC13 and H23, but not normal epithelial cells (NNM). The FITC-labeled control peptide revealed no such binding activity (Fig. 3A). Scale bar: 10 \u03bcm. [0190] To further confirm FITC-labeled SP5-2 could bind to these NSCLC cell lines, we also measured SP5-2 -bound cells using flow cytometry. Samples were prepared as in Example 2. Flow cytometry histograms show the FITC-labeled SP5-2 binding to each NSCLC cell line (blue) and the backgrounds of FITC-labeled control peptide (red). The \n\n ratio of binding activity for CLl-5, H460, A549, PC13 and H23 was 43%, 45.8%, 44.3%, 20.1% and 44%, respectively (Fig. 3B). These results revealed that PC5-2 and SP5-2 could target to NSCLC cells.</p>[0191] To further identify whether this targeting ligand has affinity for human lung cancer biopsy specimens, we tested the reactivity of PC5-2 and SP5-2 with pulmonary adenocarcinoma from lung cancer patients by immunohistochemistry. Human lung adenocarcinoma sections were prepared and the slides were incubated in the blocking buffer for 30 min, and then treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide plus 0.1 % NaN<sub>3</sub> in methanol to block endogenous peroxidase activity, and incubated with phage clones or biotin-labeled peptide. PC5-2 was detected using HRP-conjugated anti-M13 antibody using routine immunohistochemical staining.</"
