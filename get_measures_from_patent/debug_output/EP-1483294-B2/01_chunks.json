    "F-15'-GA GAC GGT GAC CAG ACT CCC TTG GCC CCAA-3'\nThe sequences of both cLL1VH and Vk were confirmed by DNA sequencing and shown in Figure 2A and 2B, respectively.</p>The fragment containing the Vk sequences of cLL1, together with the signal peptide sequences, were excised from LLIVKpBR2 by double restriction digestion with XbaI and BamHI. The \u223c550 bp Vk fragments was then subcloned into the XbaI/BamHI site of a mammalian expression vector, pdHL2. The resulting vector designated as cLL1VkpdHL2. Similarly, the ca. 750 bp fragments containing the LL1VH, together with the signal peptide sequences, were excised from LL1VHpBS2 by XhoI and BamHI digestion and isolated by electrophoresis in an agarose gel. The fragment was subcloned into the XhoI and HindIII site of cLL1 VkpdHL2 with the aid of linker comparable to both BamHI and Hindlll ends, resulting in the final expression vectors, designated as cLL1pdHL2.</p>Example 3 Transfection and expression of cLL1.Approximately 30 \u00b5g of cLL I pdHL2 was linerized by digestion with SaII and transfected into Sp2/0-Ag14 cells by electroporation. The transfected cells were plated into 96-well plate for 2 days and then selected for MTX resistance. Supernatants from colonies surviving selection were monitored for chimeric antibody secretion by ELISA assay. Positive cell clones were expanded and cLL1 was purified from cell culture supernatant by affinity chromatograpgy on a Protein A column.</p>Example 4 Binding activity assays.A competition cell binding assay was carried out to assess the immunoreactivity of cLL1 relative to the parent mLL1. A constant amount of <sup>125</sup>I-labeled mLL1 (100,000 cpm) was incubated with Raji cells in the presence of varying concentrations of cLL1 or mLL1 at 4\u00b0C for 1-2 h. The radioactivity associated with cells was determined after washing. As shown in Figure 5, cLL2 antibody exhibited comparable binding activity as that of mLL1, confirming the authenticity of the cloned V genes.</p>The results were confirmed by a second competition assay based on flow cytometry. Briefly, using Raji cells as before and varying the concentration of one antibody relative to other, as before, the amount of bound mLL1 or cLL1 was determined with FITC-labeled anti-mouse Fc or anti-human Fc antibodies followed by analysis using flow cytometry.</p>An ELISA competitive binding assay were carried out in Raji cell membrane coated plate to assess the immunoreactivity of cLL1 relative to the parent mLL1. Raji cell membrane fraction was prepared by sonication and centrifugation. The crude membrane extracts were coated in 96-well flat bottomed PVC plate by centrifugation and fixed with 0.1% glutaraldehyde. Constant amount of the biotinylated mLL1 mixed with vaying concentrations of mLL1 or cLL1 was added to the membrane coated wells and incubated at room temperature for 1-2 h. After washing, HRP-conjugated streptavidin was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The amount of HRP-conjugated streptavidin bound to the membrane-bound biotinylated mLL1 was revealed by reading A<sub>490 nm</sub> after the addition of a substrate solution containing 4 mM ortho-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride and 0.04% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p>Example 5 Choice of human frameworks and sequence design for the humanization of LL1 monoclonal antibody.By comparing the variable (V) region framework (FR) sequences of cLL1 to that of human antibodies in the Kabat data base, the FRs of cLL1VH and Vk were found to exhibit the highest degree of sequence homology to that of the human antibodies, RF-TS3 VH and HF-21/28 Vk, respectively. The amino acid sequences of are provided in Figures 3A and 3B and are compared with the cLL1VH and Vk sequences. Therefore, the FRs of RF-TS3 VH and the HF-21/28 Vk and FRs were selected as the human frameworks onto which the CDRs for",
    " and hLLIVKB (169-mer) were synthesized as described above. hLL1VKA and B were amplified by two short oligonucleotides hLL1 VKBACK and hLL1VKFOR as described above.</p>The hLL1VHA sequence represents nt 16 to 174 of the hLL1VH domain.\n<img id=\"ib0005\" path=\"imgb0005.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/554164957/EP/20191030/B2/000001/48/32/94/imgb0005.tif\"/></p>The hLL1VHB sequence represents the minus strand of the hLL1VH domain complementary to nt 153 to 321.\n<img id=\"ib0006\" path=\"imgb0006.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/554164958/EP/20191030/B2/000001/48/32/94/imgb0006.tif\"/>\nhLL1VKBACK<img id=\"ib0007\" path=\"imgb0007.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/554164959/EP/20191030/B2/000001/48/32/94/imgb0007.tif\"/>hLL1VKFOR<img id=\"ib0008\" path=\"imgb0008.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/554164960/EP/20191030/B2/000001/48/32/94/imgb0008.tif\"/></p>Gel-purified PCR products for hLLIVk were restriction-digested with PvuII and BgIIII and cloned into the complementary PvuI/BcII sites of the light chain staging vector, VKpBR2. The final expression vector hLL1 pdHL2 was constructed by sequencially subcloning the XbaI-BamHI and XhoI/BamHI fragments of hLL1Vk and VH, respectively, into pdHL2 as described above.</p>Example 7 Transfection, expression and binding activity assays for hLL1.The methods for expression and binding activity assays for hLL1 were same as described for cLL1.</p>An ELISA competitive binding assay using Raji cell membrane extract coated plate was developed to assess the immunoreactivity of hLL1. Raji cell membrane fraction was prepared by sonication and centrifugation. The crude membrane extracts were coated in 96-well flat bottomed PVC plate by centrifugation and fixed with 0.1% glutaraldehyde. Constant amount of the biotinylated mLL1 mixed with vaying concentrations of mLL1 or cLL1 was added to the membrane coated wells and incubated at room temperature for 1-2 h. After washing, HRP-conjugated streptavidin was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The amount of HRP-conjugated streptavidin bound to the membrane-bound biotinylated mull was revealed by reading A<sub>490 nm</sub> after the addition of a substrate solution containing 4 mM ortho-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride and 0.04% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. As shown by the competition assays in Figure 6, mLL1 and cLL1 antibodies exhibited similar binding activities. Likewise, the competition assays in Figure 7, hLL1 and cLL1 antibodies exhibited similar binding activities</p>Example 8 Internalization of hLL1Standard antibody processing assay was used to evaluate the internalization and metabolism of hLL1 in Raji cells (Hansen et al., 1996). Cells (10<sup>7</sup>) were incubated in 1 ml of tissue culture medium containing <sup>125</sup>I-labeled hLL1 or LL1 (10<sup>7</sup> cpm) for 1h at 37\u00b0C.
