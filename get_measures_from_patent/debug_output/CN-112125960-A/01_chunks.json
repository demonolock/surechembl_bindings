    "ted overnight at 16 \u2103. The ligation products were then transformed into E.coli DH 5. alpha. competent cells, plated on LB plates containing kanamycin, and cultured at 37 \u2103 for 12 h. And picking single colonies on the plate, and carrying out PCR identification and sequencing on the bacteria liquid. After the identification is correct, the recombinant plasmid is extracted.</p>2) Inducible expression of recombinant Cap protein</p>The recombinant plasmid was transformed into escherichia coli expression strain BL21(DE3) at a ratio of 1: 100 portions were inoculated into TB medium containing kanamycin at 37 \u2103 and cultured overnight at 220 rpm. The activated bacteria solution was inoculated into liquid TB medium containing kanamycin at a ratio of 1:50, and cultured on a shaker at 37 \u2103 and 220rpm for 2 hours. Then IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.4mmol/L, and inducible expression was carried out at 25 \u2103 and 220rpm for 10 hours. Then, the cells were collected by centrifugation, and 10ml of a buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0) was added to 100ml of the cells to resuspend the cells. The resuspended cells were sonicated and worked up on ice. Work 3s, pause 6s, Amp set to 39%, 300 cycles were repeated. The disrupted broth was then centrifuged at 12000rpm for 30min at 4 \u2103 and the supernatant was collected.</p>The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE after treatment, and the results are shown in FIG. 1, FIG. 2, FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, showing that the size of the target protein was about 28 Kd. Compared with the expression level of a plurality of schemes, in the PCV2b capsid protein gene subjected to mutation modification and optimization, the expression level of soluble recombinant proteins of the genes SEQ ID NO.6, SEQ ID NO.7 and SEQ ID NO.8 is far higher than that of the genes SEQ ID NO.1, SEQ ID NO.2, SEQ ID NO.3, SEQ ID NO.4 and SEQ ID NO. 5. The PCV2d capsid protein gene mutation modified and optimized SEQ ID NO.9, SEQ ID NO.10 and SEQ ID NO.11 genes directly borrow the PCV2b capsid protein gene optimized scheme 6, scheme 7 and scheme 8, and the expression results show that the SEQ ID NO.9, the SEQ ID NO.10 and the SEQ ID NO.11 genes all obtain the expression of high-efficiency soluble recombinant proteins. Therefore, the subsequent electron microscope observation is carried out by selecting SEQ ID NO.6, SEQ ID NO.7, SEQ ID NO.8, SEQ ID NO.9, SEQ ID NO.10 and SEQ ID NO.11 to judge whether porcine circovirus type 2b and type 2d virus-like particles are formed.</p>3) Observation by electron microscope</p>Respectively sending the recombinant protein with high expression obtained in the step 2) to a transmission electron microscope for observation. Obvious round hollow particles can be observed in the sequence schemes shown in SEQ ID NO.6, SEQ ID NO.7 and SEQ ID NO.8, and the result is shown in figure 5, wherein the diameter is about 17-20nm, which shows that the three schemes successfully form the porcine circovirus type 2b virus-like particles.

Then adding alpha-lactose with the final concentration of 2g/L, carrying out induced expression for 20h at 25 \u2103 and 220rpm, and then centrifuging to collect bacterial liquid; (ii) a</p>5) The supernatant of the bacterial solution collected in step 4) was disrupted, and after preliminary purification with saturated ammonium sulfate, the DEAE anion exchange column was equilibrated with a buffer (20mM PB buffer, pH6.5), and then the supernatant of the preliminary purification with saturated ammonium sulfate was slowly loaded onto the column after equilibration. The buffer solution (20mM PB buffer solution containing 0.3M NaCl, pH6.5) containing a certain salt concentration is selected to elute the hybrid protein, and the buffer solution (20mM PB buffer solution containing 1M NaCl, pH6.5) containing a certain salt concentration is selected to elute the target protein, so that the recombinant 2 b-type and 2 d-type Cap proteins with certain purity, namely the primarily purified recombinant 2 b-type and 2 d-type Cap proteins, can be obtained, and the results are shown in FIG. 7.</p>Fine purification of recombinant type 2b and type 2d Cap proteins: respectively carrying out 5-to 10-fold ultrafiltration concentration on the recombinant 2b type and 2d type Cap protein solutions subjected to ion exchange chromatography by using a tangential flow membrane filtration system with the pore diameter of 300 kD; a buffer solution (20mM PB buffer solution containing 0.2M NaCl, pH6.5) with a certain salt concentration is selected to balance an agarose 6FF gel filtration chromatographic column, and 5 percent of the column volume is respectively loaded into recombinant 2b type and 2d type Cap protein solutions which are subjected to ultrafiltration concentration after primary purification. Collected at OD<sub>280nm</sub>The sample eluted at the first absorbable peak, i.e., the finely purified protein of interest, was monitored and the results are shown in FIG. 8. It can be seen that the purity of the target protein can reach an extremely high level after the second purification step,typical porcine circovirus type 2b and 2d virus-like particles, designated PCV2b-VLP and PCV2d-VLP, respectively, were seen under an electron microscope, and the results are shown in FIG. 9.</p>Preparation of bivalent porcine circovirus type 2b and 2d virus-like particle vaccines: the PCV2b-VLP protein solution and the PCV2d-VLP protein solution which are purified and inactivated by beta-propiolactone with the final concentration of 0.05 percent are mixed uniformly in equal proportion, and are emulsified with nano 603 adjuvant (purchased from Beijing Tael technologies, Ltd.) according to the mass ratio of 2:1 after sterile filtration to prepare the bivalent virus-like particle vaccine, so that the protein concentrations of the PCV2b-VLP and the PCV2d-VLP in each milliliter of the vaccine are both 50 micro"
