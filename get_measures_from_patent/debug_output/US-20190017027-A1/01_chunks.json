Dowdy, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, Calif.), which contains an N-terminal TAT PTD. The generated pTAT-HA-HoxB4 plasmid was confirmed by sequence analysis and transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS bacteria (Invitrogene\u2122).</p>Bacterial cells growing at log phase were induced with 1 mM IPTG at 30 C for 4 hours and collected by centrifugation. Since the 6\u00d7His-fused recombinant TAT-HoxB4 protein was found to be sequestered into inclusion bodies by the host bacteria, the cells were disrupted by sonication in denaturation solution (6 M guanidinium, 20 mM NaPO<sub>4</sub>, and 0.5 M NaCl, pH 7.8) and the 6\u00d7His-fused TAT-HoxB4 recombinant proteins were then bound to nickel resins (ProBond resin, Invitrogen\u2122).</p>After several washings, the TAT-HoxB4 fusion proteins were eluted in 20 mM NaPO<sub>4</sub>, pH 4.0, 0.5 M NaCl, 8 M urea plus 10 mM imidazole. The TAT-HoxB4 fusion proteins were then desalted on a Sephadex G-25 column into IMDM medium, aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. immediately.</p>The purity and concentration of the TAT-HoxB4 fusion proteins were determined by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and visualized with Coomassie blue staining. The purified TAT-HA-HoxB4 recombinant protein runs as a \u224837 KD protein. The concentration of the purified TAT-HA-HoxB4 protein was estimated by comparison with a BSA protein standard in the same gel.</p>Based on computer modeling, Ho et al. (2001 Cancer Res 61: 474-477) demonstrated that a modified PTD</p>possesses significantly enhanced protein transduction potential compared with the native TAT PTD, both in vitro and in vivo.

    "-P00007.TIF\"/>GCC GGA TCC CCA TCG-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO: 19) oligos were digested with BamHI and purified using a kit (Qiagen\u2122). Then TAT fragment in pTAT-HA-HoxB4 plasmid was replaced with the modified PTD fragment, and triplicated PTD inserts were selected based on restriction fragment size and confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. This plasmid is referred to as ptPTD-HA-HoxB4. pTAT-HA-HoxB4 and ptPTD-HA-HoxB4 plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS bacteria (Invitrogen\u2122), and HoxB4 fusion protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mM IPTG at 30\u00b0 C. for 4 h. The 6\u00d7His-fused recombinant TAT-HoxB4 and tPTD-HoxB4 proteins were sequestered into inclusion bodies by the host bacteria, so the cells were disrupted by sonication in denaturation solution (6 M guanidinium, 20 mM NaPO<sub>4</sub>, and 0.5 M NaCl, pH 7.8) and the 6\u00d7His-fused TAT-HoxB4 and tPTD-HoxB4 recombinant proteins were then bound to nickel resins (ProBond resin, Invitrogen\u2122) After several washings, the TAT-HoxB4 and tPTD-HoxB4 fusion proteins were eluted in 20 mM NaPO4, pH 4.0, 0.5 M NaCl, 8 M urea plus 10 mM imidazole. The TAT-HoxB4 and tPTD-HoxB4 fusion proteins were then desalted in Sephadex G-25 columns into IMDM medium, and aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. immediately. The purity and concentration of the TAT-HoxB4 and tPTD-HoxB4 fusion proteins were determined by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and visualized with Coomassie blue staining. The purified TAT-HoxB4 and tPTD-HoxB4 recombinant proteins ran as \u224838 KD proteins. The concentrations of the purified TAT-HoxB4 and tPTD-HoxB4 proteins were estimated by comparison with a BSA protein standard in the same gel. For stability assays, TAT-HoxB4 and tPTDHoxB4 proteins were added to IMDM medium with 5% FBS or Stemline II medium with live hESCs in Ultra low 24-well plates and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. Aliquots of the medium were removed at different times and subjected for SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, and visualized with Coomassie blue staining.\n</p>Beslu et al. (2002 Blood 100: 22a) have reported that the first 31 amino acids of the N-terminus of HoxB4 are dispensable for its function, and that the removal of the N-terminal 33 amino acids generates a more stable protein. The results confirmed that the full length TAT-HoxB4 protein was unstable, forming a \u224830 KD protein after several thawing cycles, whereas the N-terminus-deleted TAT-HoxB4 and tPTD-HoxB4 proteins retained their integrity after repeated thawing and overnight incubation at 37\u00b0 C. (FIG. 19C). As shown in FIG. 19A, tPTD-HoxB4 and TATHoxB4 were relatively pure proteins after multiple column chromatography under denaturing conditions and desalting. The purified tPTD-HoxB4 protein ran as a single \u224838 KD band under native SDS-PAGE, with a maximum solubility in PBS or IMDM medium of 250 to 300 \u03bcg/ml</p>as estimated by comparison with BSA protein standards. Similar results were obtained from the TAT-HoxB4 fusion protein.</p>Krosl et al. (2003 Nat Medicine 9: 1428-1432) have observed that TAT-HoxB4 protein is very unstable in environments containing FBS and it has to be refreshed every second hour in order to retain biological function. The results presented here confirmed that tPTD-HoxB4 was labile in medium containing 5% FBS, with a half life less than one hour (FIG. 19B); pretreatment of FBS at 70\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes eliminated most of the enzymatic activity. To further examine its stability, tPTD-HoxB4 protein was added to serum free Stemline medium and cultured with hESCs at 37\u00b0 C. As shown in FIG. 19C, a substantial fraction of tPTD-HoxB4 protein could be detected, even after 48 h of culture with hESCs.</p>Example 4: Matrigel Plugs Transplanted into SCID Mice Give Rise to Endothelial CellsHemangioblast-derived endothelial cells or pure hemangioblasts (1\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>cells) derived from H1-GFP human ES cells were purified and resuspended in 700 \u03bcl of Matrigel (BD Biosciences\u2122). These cells were injected subcutaneously in the dorsal region of 4-week-old SCID mice (Jackson Laboratory\u2122). Five weeks after injection, the Matrigel plugs were removed from the animals and frozen sections were prepared from the plugs. Cross sections of the Matrigel plugs were fixed, and stained "
