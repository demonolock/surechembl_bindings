In one embodiment, said rodent Fab fragment has the binding affinity of a Fab fragment comprising variable domain sequences of a rat antibody designated FIB504.64 produced by hybridoma cell line deposited under American Type Culture Collection Accession Number ATCC HB-293. In a further embodiment, a humanized Fab fragment of the invention has the binding affinity of a Fab fragment comprising variable domain sequences of an antibody produced by anyone of the humanized anti-beta7 antibodies of the invention. As is well-established in the art, binding affinity of a ligand to its receptor can be determined using any of a variety of assays, and expressed in terms of a variety of quantitative values. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the binding affinity is expressed as Kd values and reflects intrinsic binding affinity (e.g., with minimized avidity effects). Generally and preferably, binding affinity is measured in vitro, whether in a cell-free or cell-associated setting. As described in greater detail herein, fold difference in binding affinity can be quantified in terms of the ratio of the binding affinity value of a humanized antibody in Fab form and the binding affinity value of a reference/comparator Fab antibody (e.g., a murine antibody having donor hypervariable region sequences), wherein the binding affinity values are determined under similar assay conditions. Thus, in one embodiment, the fold difference in binding affinity is determined as the ratio of the Kd values of the humanized antibody in Fab form and said reference/comparator Fab antibody.

    "no acid position numbering as in Kabat\", and variations thereof, refers to the numbering system used for heavy chain variable domains or light chain variable domains of the compilation of antibodies in Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. (1991). Using this numbering system, the actual linear amino acid sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of, or insertion into, a FR or CDR of the variable domain. For example, a heavy chain variable domain may include a single amino acid insert (residue 52a according to Kabat) after residue 52 of H2 and inserted residues (e.g. residues 82a, 82b, and 82c, etc according to Kabat) after heavy chain FR residue 82. The Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given antibody by alignment at regions of homology of the sequence of the antibody with a \"standard\" Kabat numbered sequence.</p>The phrase \"substantially similar,\" or \"substantially the same\", as used herein, denotes a sufficiently high degree of similarity between two numeric values (generally one associated with an antibody of the invention and the other associated with a reference/comparator antibody) such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of little or no biological and/or statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by said values (e.g., Kd values). The difference between said two values is preferably less than about 50%, preferably less than about 40%, preferably less than about 30%, preferably less than about 20%, preferably less than about 10% as a function of the value for the reference/comparator antibody.</p>\"Binding affinity\" generally refers to the strength of the sum total of noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g., an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, \"binding affinity\" refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1:1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., antibody and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (Kd). Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art, including those described herein. Low-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to dissociate readily, whereas high-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain bound longer. A variety of methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art, any of which can be used for purposes of the present invention. Specific illustrative embodiments are described in the following.</p>In one embodiment, the \"Kd\" or \"Kd value\" according to this invention is measured by a radiolabeled antigen binding assay (RIA) performed with the Fab version of an antibody of interest and its antigen as described by the following assay that measures solution binding affinity of Fabs for antigen by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of (<sup>125</sup>I)-labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen, then capturing bound antigen with an anti-Fab antibody-coated plate (Chen, et al., (1999) J. Mol Biol 293:865-881). To establish conditions for the assay, microtiter plates (Dynex) are coated overnight with 5 ug/ml of a capturing anti-Fab antibody (Cappel Labs) in 50 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.6), and subsequently blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature (approximately 23\u00b0C). In a non-adsorbant plate (Nunc #269620), 100 pM or 26 pM [<sup>125</sup>I]-antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest (e.g., consistent with assessment of an anti-VEGF antibody, Fab-12, in Presta et al., (1997) Cancer Res. 57:4593-4599). The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight; however, the incubation may continue for a longer period (e.g., 65 hours) to insure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter, the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature (e.g., for one hour). The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS. When the plates have dried, 150 ul/well of scintillant (MicroScint-20; Packard) is added, and the plates are counted on a Topcount gamma counter (Packard) for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20% of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays. According to another embodiment the Kd or Kd value is measured by using surface plasmon resonance assays using a BIAcore\u2122-2000 or a BIAcore\u2122-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) at 25C with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at \u223c10 response units (RU). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIAcore Inc.) are activated with N-ethyl-N'-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, into 5ug/ml (\u223c0.2uM) before injection at a flow rate of 5ul/minute to achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen, 1M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) at 25\u00b0C at a flow rate of approximately 25ul/min. Association rates (k<sub>on</sub>) and dissociation rates (k<sub>off</sub>) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneous fitting the association and dissociation sensorgram. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) is calculated as the ratio k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>. See, e.g., Chen, Y., et al., (1999) J. Mol Biol 293:865-881. If the on-rate exceeds 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> S<sup>-1</sup> by the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation = 295 nm; emission = 340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25\u00b0C of a 20nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow equipped spectrophometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-Aminco spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stir red cuvette.</p>An \"on-rate\" or \"rate of association\" or \"association rate\" or \"k<sub>on</sub>\" according to this invention can also be determined with the same surface plasmon resonance technique described above using a BIAcore\u2122-2000 or a BIAcore\u2122-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) at 25C with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at \u223c10 response units (RU).

    "efers to a compound or composition which inhibits growth of a cell whose growth is dependent upon beta7 activation either in vitro or in vivo. Thus, the growth inhibitory agent may be one which significantly reduces the percentage of beta7-dependent cells in S phase.

Classical M-phase blockers include the vincas (vincristine and vinblastine), taxanes, and topoisomerase II inhibitors such as doxorubicin, epirubicin, daunorubicin, etoposide, and bleomycin. Those agents that arrest G1 also spill over into S-phase arrest, for example, DNA alkylating agents such as tamoxifen, prednisone, dacarbazine, mechlorethamine, cisplatin, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, and ara-C.

Humanized Fib504 variant concentrations resulting in 50% inhibition (IC<sub>50</sub>) of the binding of RPMI8866 cells to MAdCAM-1 were measured by coating Nunc Maxisorp\u2122 96-well plates with 2 \u00b5g/ml in PBS, 100 \u00b5l/well MAdCAM-1-Ig (Genentech, Inc., where Ig refers to fusion of MAdCAM-1 to an Fc region) overnight at 4 \u00b0C. After blocking the plates with 200 \u00b5l/well of 5 mg/ml BSA for one hour at room temperature, 50 \u00b5l of humanized Fib504 variants in assay media (RPMI 1640 media, Hyclone\u00ae, Logan Utah, USA, supplemented with 5 mg/mL BSA) were added to each well and 150,000 BCECF-labeled cells (BCECF, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in 50 \u00b5l of assay media were added to each well and incubated for 15 minutes at 37 \u00b0C. The wells were washed two times with 150 \u00b5l of assay media to remove unbound cells. The bound cells were solubilized with 100 \u00b5l of 0.1% SDS in 50 mM Tris/HCl pH7.5. The amount of fluorescence released from lysed cells was measured by SPECTRAmax GEMINI\u2122 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at 485 nm excitation 530 nm emission wavelengths. The fluorescence values were analyzed as a function of the concentrations of the humanized Fib504 variants added in each assay, using a four-parameter nonlinear least squares fit, to obtain the IC<sub>50</sub> values of each humanized Fib504 variant in the assay. IC<sub>50</sub> and IC<sub>90</sub> values were estimated from the four-parameter fit. Fig. 14 is an exemplary plot of the results. The IC<sub>90</sub> and IC<sub>50</sub> values for each of the variants tested are shown below in Ta",
