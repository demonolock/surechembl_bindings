For labeling, 1.5 \u03bcM CMFDA cell tracker (Molecular Probes, Cat# C7025) were added to the HEK293 cells (30 min, 37\u00b0 C., 500 rpm). Cells were washed twice with DMEM without phenol red before being added to the wells. After incubation of the cells on the plates, plates were centrifuged for 5 min at 100 g. As non-adherent cells move to the bottom of the V-shaped wells, they were quantified by measuring the fluorescence intensity through bottom reading (Genios microplate reader, Excitation 485 nm, Emission 535 nm).</p>Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)</p>Binding analyses were performed on a Biacore 2000.

After immobilization, the chips in each flow cell were saturated with 1 \u03bcM D-Biotin. As a control, an unspecific serum was injected through all cells. The flow rate of the antibodies was 30 \u03bcl/min at a concentration of 2 \u03bcg/ml, volume injected 100 \u03bcl. The dissociation time was set at 500 sec.

    "n the cell based assay can be explained by its rather low affinity (especially high off-rate) towards the target protein (Table 3). In contrast mAb 21-5-4 strongly reduces the binding of HEK293 cells to ThrOpn. Furthermore, this mAb also inhibits binding of HEK cells to MmpOpn (FIG. 5B) again confirming its pan-reactivity against different Opn products. MMP cleavage site specific mAbs 7-5-4 and 9-3-1 inhibit exclusively MmpOpn induced adhesion of HEK cells (FIG. 5B) also in this case confirming data derived from ELISA and Western Blot analyses and thus proving their specificity.</p>Example 5: Affinity Determination of mAbs 4-4-2, 7-5-4, 9-3-1, and 21-5-4 Using SPRIn order to define the binding strength of selected mAbs against their individual targets SPR analysis was performed using peptides representing the different Opn products. Monoclonal Ab 4-4-2 exhibited an affinity against ThrOpn of 13.9 nM and an off-rate value (describes the stability of the antibody-target-complex once formed) of 2,79 E-3 sec<sup>\u22121</sup>. This off-rate value is rather high, indicating that the stability of the target-antibody complex is moderate. Thus in a situation where multiple washing steps are included (e.g. in the used functional cell based adhesion assay) the antibody will be washed away from its target. This is expected to be the reason why this antibody does not show inhibition of the HEK293 adhesion in the functional assay. On the other hand the mAb 4-4-2 shows medium to good affinity (KD 13.9 nM) and thus this antibody exhibits a high on-rate capacity, which represents the capacity and velocity to identify and bind its target. In a more physiological situation where antibody persistence is not influenced by steps depleting the antibody, mAb 4-4-2 is expected also display functional activity.</p>Monoclonal Abs 7-5-4 and 9-3-1 exhibit almost identical off-rate and KD values. In both cases the KD value is in the lowest nM or even high pM range, representing high affinity. An excellent off-rate value is exhibited by mAb 21-5-4. This antibody also displays the highest affinity against the target region.</p>TABLE 3Affinity determination of mAbs against their targetsName ofOff-ratecloneOpn product testedvalues (sec<sup>\u22121</sup>)K<sub>d </sub>values (nM)4-4-2ThrOpn2.79E\u2212313.9E\u221297-5-4MmpOpn8.89E\u221251.12E\u221299-3-1MmpOpn8.79E\u221250.97E\u2212921-5-4ThrOpn and MmpOpn1.00E\u221250.84E\u22129</p>Summarizing the mAb Results</p>Monoclonal Ab 4-4-2 specifically recognizes ThrOpn in its native (FIG. 3A) as well as in its denatured (FIG. 4A) form.</p>Monoclonal Abs 7-5-4 and 9-3-1 specifically recognizes MmpOpn in its native (FIGS. 3 B and C) as well as in its denatured (FIGS. 4B and C) form and are functionally active, leading to a clear inhibition of the MmpOpn-induced adhesion of HEK293 cells (FIG. 5B).</p>Monoclonal Ab 21-5-4 recognizes all Opn fragments in their native (FIG. 3D) as well as in their denatured (FIG. 4D) forms.
