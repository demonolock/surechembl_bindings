After single colony emerged, pick up 5 moderately sized colonies, extract plasmids and send out for sequencing (Idobio, Nanjing). Sequenced the company sequencing (Idobio, Nanjing), sequenced the results and synthesized the NKG2D specific CAR. Comparing the sequencing results with the sequence of the synthesized NKG2D specific CAR molecule, the sequence was completely correct and proved that the expression plasmids of the specific CAR targeting NKG2DL was obtained (Abbreviation of KD-025 CAR lentivirus vector, EFS promoter).</p>Step 3), extraction and purification of specific CAR expression plasmid targeting NKG2DL.</p>In step 2) the Stbl3 strain comprising the plasmid that expresses the specific CAR molecule targeting NKG2DL is cultured in LB medium, and is extracted by using the high purity and without endotoxin Qiagen Plasmid Midi Kit (Qiagen, German) for the infecting purpose. The operation steps are as follows thereof:</p>1. Harvest overnight bacterial culture 150 ml in a centrifuge tube by centrifuging at 6000\u00d7g for 15 mins, as much as possible to remove the supernatant (bacterial cells can be precipitated by multiple centrifugation to collect into one centrifuge tube if the bacterial liquid is overload).</p>2. Completely suspend the bacterial pellet in 4 ml buffer P1 at the centrifuge tube by a pipette or a vortex oscillator (check if RNase A was added first).</p>3. Add 4 ml buffer P2, mix thoroughly by softly inverting 4-6 times, and incubate at room temperature for 5 mins.</p>4. Add 4 ml prechilled buffer P3, mix thoroughly by softly inverting 4-6 times, and incubate at room temperature for 5 mins.</p>5. Centrifuge at 20000\u00d7g for 10 mins at 4\u00b0 C.</p>6.
