LCMS (m/z) 582.5 [M+H], Tr = 1.60 min. </p>Biological Examples: </p>Inhibition of Peptidyl-Prolyl Isomerase (PPIase) Activity </p> The PPIase assay was based on the procedure reported by Janowski et al. (Anal. </p>Biochem. 1997, 252, 299). Assay buffer (1980 L of a solution containing 35 mM HEPES pH 7.8, 50M DTT, and 0.01 % NP40) was pre-equilibrated to 10\u00b0C in a quartz cuvette equipped with an overhead stirrer. To this solution was added 10L of compound in DMSO (final concentration: 0.5% DMSO), followed by 5 L of a 2 M stock solution of cyclophilin A (final concentration: 5 nM). The reaction was initiated with the addition of 5 L of 40 mM of the tetrapeptide Succ-AAPF-pNA (100 M final concentration) dissolved in a solution of 0.5 M LiCI in trifluoroethanol. Upon the initiation of the reaction, the absorbance of the peptide substrate was monitored at 330 nm for five minutes using a Beckman Coulter DU800 spectrophotometer. Progress curves were fit with a single-exponential decay model to calculate rates. The IC<sub>50</sub> values were calculated with a four-parameter logistic fit using GraphPad Prism software. </p>Cyclophi l i n A TR-FRET Competitive Bi ndi ng Assay </p> Inhibitor potency was measured using a competitive binding assay with a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) readout. To a reaction buffer consisting of 35 mM HEPES pH 7.8, 100 mM NaCI, 0.01 % NP-40 (Pierce), 1 mM DTT, and 1 % DMSO were added the following: 5 nM of cyclophilin A modified at the N-terminus with an 8xhistidine affinity tag (CypA); 150 nM of cyclosporin A modified with a linker attached to a Cy5 fluorophore (CsA- Cy5); 1 nM Eu-labeled anti-(6xHis) antibody (Perkin-Elmer); and test compound at one of various concentrations. The total volume of the assay solution was 100 L. After a two-hour incubation, the TR-FRET was measured using a Perkin Elmer Envision plate reader (excitation at 340 nm, emission measured at 590 nm and 665 nm). The signal was calculated as the ratio of the emission at 665nm to that at 590 nm. An IC<sub>50</sub> value was calculated using a four- parameter logistic fit. \n\n When tested, certain compounds of this invention were found to inhibit cyclophilin binding as listed in Table 1 . The IC<sub>50</sub>'s (TR-FRET) are presented as ranges wherein A is &lt; 100 nM, B is 101 to 1000 nM and C is 1001 to 10,000 nM. </p>Antivi ral Activity </p> The antiviral activity of a compound can be measured using standard screening protocols: for example, cell-based Flavivirus immunodetection assay and cell-based Flavivirus cytopathic effect assay as described in U.S. Patent Publication Number US 20130022573, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. </p> One aspect "
