    " and presented as volcanic and cluster analysis plots.</p>1.3 Gene function annotation and pathway enrichment analysis</p>The DEGs obtained was imported into the DAVID 6.8 database (https:// DAVID. Ncifcrf. Gov /), and Gene Ontology (GO)) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Gene and genome encyclopedia (KEGG) enrichment analysis was performed on DEGs up-and down-regulated GSE 102541. The results are represented in enrichment analysis plots and chord plots. All published database information was obtained at 9 months 2022.</p>1.4 Major reagents and instruments</p>The reagents and equipment used included: terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP notch end marker (TUNEL), apoptosis detection kit (bi cloud biosciences, shanghai, china), western blotting kit (Abcam, cambridge, UK), miR-100-5p over-expressed lentivirus (ribobio corporation, guangzhou, china), brain stereotactic, mouse Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (MCAO) wire plug, animal anesthesia machine and isoflurane (RWD biosciences, china deep-leaved), electronic balance (beijing saikolisi instruments systems engineering, huntington, germany), 5804R bench-top high speed refrigerated centrifuge and gel imaging system (Syngene, bangarol, india).</p>1.5 Grouping and MCAO modeling</p>20 Male C57BL/6j mice of Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) class, aged 8-10 weeks and of mass 20-25g, were purchased from Experimental animal center at Hebei university of medical science. Mice were divided into control, model, miR-100-5p inhibitor (KD) and miR-100-5p over-expression (OE) lentiviruses, 5 each. Mice were kept in sterile rooms, given sufficient food and water, and were adapted for one week for subsequent experiments. The preoperative period is 12 hours, and the patients are fasted in a sterile environment and are not forbidden. After isoflurane anesthesia, the mice were fixed in a supine position on an operating table, neck skin prepared, and sterilized with iodophor. The neck was centrally cut, subcutaneous fat and muscle carefully separated, and the right Common Carotid Artery (CCA), external Carotid Artery (ECA) and Internal Carotid Artery (ICA) were isolated. The CCA and ICA were temporarily clamped using an arteriovenous clamp, and the wire plug was prepared without tightening the distal end of the CCA. Isolating ECA trunk, blunt separating thyroid artery and occipital artery, and fulgurating; the ECA is then pulled down to align it in line with the ICA. A small bevel incision was made with an ophthalmic scissors at about 2mm from the distal end of the CCA bifurcation, from which a heparin-soaked wire plug (0.26 mm diameter) was inserted, and the suture was tightened. The ICA clip was released and the wire plug was slowly pushed from ICA into the cranial artery branch. MCAO was considered successful when a feeling of resistance was felt at about 2.0cm from the ICA and ECA bifurcation. The prepared wire bolt is then tightened and the start of the embolism is recorded. A small amount of penicillin injec"
