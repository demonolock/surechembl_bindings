    "e present invention provides isolated, soluble Fc\u03b3RIA polypeptides capable of neutralizing IgG- or immune complex-mediated signaling in immune cells. Generally, a soluble Fc\u03b3RIA polypeptide of the invention comprises an amino acid sequence that is at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99% or more identical to amino acid residues 16-282 or 16-292 of SEQ ID NO:2, wherein the isolated polypeptide is capable of specifically binding to the Fc domain of IgG (e.g., human IgG such as, for example, human IgGl). A soluble Fc\u03b3RIA polypeptide of the invention specifically binds if it binds to monomeric human IgG (e.g., human IgGl) with a binding affinity (K<sub>a</sub>) of at least 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>\"</sup>', preferably at least 10<sup>7</sup> M<sup>\"</sup>', more preferably at least 10<sup>8</sup> M<sup>\"1</sup>, and most preferably at least 10<sup>9</sup> M<sup>\"1</sup>. In certain embodiments, a soluble Fc\u03b3RIA polypeptide of the invention binds to monomeric human IgG with a binding affinity (K<sub>a</sub>) of between 10<sup>8</sup> M<sup>\"1</sup> and 10<sup>9</sup> M<sup>'1</sup>. The binding affinity of a soluble Fc\u03b3RIA polypeptide can be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art, for example, by Scatchard analysis (Scatchard, Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 51 :660, 1949). In addition to determining an affinity constant (K<sub>11</sub>), an alternative means of measuring affinity is the equilibrium constant (Kd), where a decrease would be observed with the improvement in affinity. In certain embodiments, a soluble Fc\u03b3RIA polypeptide of the invention binds to human IgGl with an equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) of \n\n less than 10<sup>'8</sup> M, preferably less than 10<sup>\"9</sup> M, and more preferably less than 10<sup>\"10</sup> M. In a specific variation, a soluble Fc\u03b3RIA polypeptide of the invention binds to human IgGl with an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kj) of about 1.7 x 10<sup>\"10</sup> M. In some embodiments, a soluble Fc\u03b3RIA polypeptide of the invention comprises amino acid residues 16-282 or 16-292 of SEQ ID NO:2. In specific variations, the soluble Fc\u03b3RIA polypeptide consists of amino acid residues 16-X of SEQ ID NO:2, wherein X is an integer from 282 to 292, inclusive. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, a soluble Fc\u03b3RIA polypeptide consists of amino acid residues 16-282, 16-283, 16-284, 16-285, 16-286, 16-287, 16-288, 16-289, 16-290, 16-291, or 16-292 of SEQ ID NO:2.</p>[36] The present invention also provides isolated polypeptides and epitopes comprising at least 15 contiguous amino acid residues of an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:3 (residues 16-292 of SEQ ID NO:2). Illustrative polypeptides include polypeptides that either comprise or consist of residues 16-282 or 16-292 of SEQ ID NO:2, or a functional IgG binding fragment thereof. Moreover, the present invention also provides isolated polypeptides as disclosed above that bind to, block, inhibit, reduce, antagonize or neutralize the activity of IgG, present in a monomelic form or as a multimeric immune complex.</p>[37] The present invention also includes variant soluble Fc\u03b3RIA receptor polypeptides, wherein the amino acid sequence of the variant soluble Fc\u03b3RIA receptor polypeptide shares at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99% or more identity with the amino acid r",
    "concentration range of 0.03-24 x 10<sup>\"6</sup> M of soluble Fc\u03b3R was used. Each soluble Fc\u03b3R (Fc\u03b3RIIA-CH6 and Fc\u03b3RIIIA-CH6) was injected at a flow rate of 10 \u03bcL/min for 1 minute. The dissociation time for each Fc\u03b3R was 5 minutes. Each Fc\u03b3RIIA- CH6 and Fc\u03b3RIIIA-CH6 concentration was tested in duplicate using a random sequence. Each measurement was followed by a single 30 second injection of HBS-EP at 30 \u03bcL/min to regenerate the IgGl surface.</p>[350] Binding curves for all three soluble Fc\u03b3Rs were processed by subtraction of the reference surface curve from the specific binding surface curve, as well as subtraction of a buffer- injection curve. The processed binding curves were globally fitted to a 1 : 1 binding model and the resulting kinetic and equilibrium constants were evaluated using Biacore software.</p>[351] The soluble Fc\u03b3Rs bound to immobilized human IgGl in a manner that was best-fit by a 1 :1 binding interaction. The IgGl exhibited some loss of binding activity upon covalent immobilization and the activity of the surface ranged from 26-81% of the theoretical maximum. The association and dissociation phases of Fc\u03b3RIA-CH6 binding to IgGl were measurable over a time period of &gt; 200 seconds, allowing kinetic analysis of the binding curves. Fc\u03b3RIA-CH6 bound to IgGl with association (k<sub>a</sub>) and dissociation (kj) rate constants of 2.8 x 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>\"</sup>'s<sup>\"</sup>' and 4.6 x 10<sup>\"4</sup> s<sup>'1</sup>, respectively, yielding an equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 1.7 x 10<sup>\"</sup>'\u00b0 M. The association/dissociation rates for Fc\u03b3RIIA-CH6 and Fc\u03b3RIIIA-CH6 were too fast to measure accurately, so the equilibrium dissociation constants were determined at steady state. Binding of Fc\u03b3RIIIA-CH6 and Fc\u03b3RIlA-CH6 to IgG 1 was saturable and of low affinity with estimated K<sub>D</sub>s of 0.63 x 10<sup>\"6</sup> M and 1.9 x 10<sup>\"6</sup> M, respectively. Each soluble Fc\u03b3R bound to immobilized rabbit anti- OVA IgG with rates and affinities similar to that observed with human IgGl .</p>EXAMPLE Il Purification of Fc\u03b3RIA-Ig Fusion Protein</p>[352] Protein A Affinity Purification: Delivered 0.22\u03bcm filtered media assessed for expression of fusion protein using RP-HPLC and quantitative western blot probing against the heavy chain of the Ig tag. An appropriately sized Protein A column is constructed, assuming a binding capacity of no greater than 15mg of fusion protein per mL of packed bed. The resin used can be \n\n either Poros A50 (AB Biosystems) or Recombinant Protein A Sepharose Fast Flow (GE Healthcare). The column is equilibrated in ZGI Ix PBS and the media is loaded over the column at 4 C, making sure not to exceed the maximum flow rate and pressure rating of the resin. Although the loading of the protein A resin can take place over multiple days, an overnight load is typical for 10-20L of delivered media. Once the load is complete, the column is washed with at least lOCV of ZGI Ix PBS, monitoring the abs",
    "<sub>4</sub>, 150 mM NaCl pH 7.0 until the absorbance at 215 nm and A280 nm returned to baseline for at least 2 column volumes (CV). Elution of bound protein was achieved using a 10 CV descending pH gradient of 20 mM citric acid, 5 mM dibasic NaPO<sub>4</sub>, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 3.0 at a flow rate of 61 cm/h. Fractions containing Fc\u03b3RIA were identified by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, were neutralized by the addition of 2 M Tris pH 7.0 to a 0.2 M final concentration and brought to 100 mM NaCl by the addition of 4 M NaCl.</p>B. Cation Exchange Chromatography</p>[369] The Tween-20 was removed from the Fc\u03b3RIA pool by HS50 chromatography. The Fc\u03b3RIA elution pool was adjusted to 10 mM MES pH 6.0 using solid MES and HCl and was diluted to &lt; 5mS/cm using 1OmM MES pH 6.0. The Fc\u03b3RlA-containing pool was loaded over an HS50 column to achieve quantitative capture at a flow rate of 141 cm/h and the resin was washed at 382 cm/h with 10 mM MES pH 6.0 until A215 and A280nm UV signals returned to baseline for at least 5 CV. Bound Fc\u03b3RIA was eluted at 382cm/hr with a gradient of increasing NaCl concentration using 5 CV to a maximum of 60% elution buffer which consisted of 10 mM MES, 2 M NaCl pH 6.0. Fractions were collected and Fc\u03b3RIA was identified by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.</p>C. Size Exclusion Chromatography</p>[370] The amount of protein as assessed by absorbance at 280 nm and the Fc\u03b3RlA- containing fraction of the buffer-exchanged HS50 elution pool was concentrated using a 30 kD molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) Ultracel centrifugal concentrator or a YM30 63.5 mm stirred cell membrane depending on the amount of Fc\u03b3RIA present. The final concentrate volume was no more than 3% of the volume of gel filtration column used. The concentrated Fc\u03b3RIA pool was injected onto a Superdex 75 column (for &lt;1 mg Fc\u03b3RIA, the column size was 10/300 mm; for 1-10 mg, the column size was 16/60 mm; and for &gt;10 mg, the column size was 26/60 mm) and the protein was eluted isocratically at a flow rate of 34-76 cm/h. The mobile phase used was 35 mM NaPO<sub>4</sub>, 120 mM NaCl pH 7.2. Fractions were collected and Fc\u03b3RIA was identified by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The Fc\u03b3RlA-containing fractions were concentrated to 20 mg/mL final concentration as described above, passed through a 0.22 \u03bcm sterile-filter, and stored at -80<sup>0</sup>C. The identity of the Fc\u03b3RIA was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing and amino acid analyses. N-terminal sequence analysis showed that the mature protein starts with a pyro-glutamic acid, which is post-translationally converted from the glutamine residue at amino acid position 16.</p>EXAMPLE IS Anti-inflammatory Activities of Soluble Fc\u03b3RIA</p>A. Immune Complex Precipitation \n\n [371] Chicken egg ovalbumin (OVA) was dissolved to a final concentration of 15.0 \u03bcg/mL in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and combined with 300 \u03bcg rabbit polyclonal anti-OVA antibodies/mL in a final volume of 200\u03bcL in the presence and absence of the indicated con",
    "n of Fc\u03b3RIA-CH6 at the start of the assay produced a dose- dependent reduction in immune complex precipitation (Figure 1, triangles and squares). Immune complex precipitation was completely abolished by 1500 nM Fc\u03b3RIA-CH6. Identical data were obtained when untagged, recombinant soluble Fc\u03b3RIA was used. Since the precipitation of antigen:antibody immune complexes appears to be dependent on non-covalent interactions between the antibody Fc heavy chains (M\u00f8ller, Immunology 38:631-640) and Fc\u03b3 receptors bind to the Fc portion of antibodies (Dijstelbloem HM et al, Trends Immunol. 22:510-516, 2001), these data suggest \n\n that soluble Fc\u03b3RIA disrupts immune complex precipitation by binding to the Fc portion of the anti- OVA antibodies.</p>[383] To directly evaluate the interaction of Fc\u03b3RIA-CH6 with antibody Fc, the binding of Fc\u03b3RIA-CH6 to immobilized human IgGl was assessed by surface plasmon resonance analyses. A monoclonal human IgGl antibody was immobilized to the sensor surface in a single flow cell at an RU (resonance units) level of 485, a density level within optimal levels for kinetic analysis of Fc\u03b3RlA-CH6, presuming a binding stoichiometry of one Fc\u03b3RIA molecule with one IgGl molecule (Woof and Burton, Nature Rev. Immunol. 4:1-11, 2004). Fc\u03b3RIA rapidly bound to immobilized IgGl with rates of association and dissociation of 2.8 x 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>\"</sup>'s<sup>\"</sup>' and 4.6 x 10<sup>*4</sup> s<sup>\"1</sup>, respectively, values which yield a calculated equilibrium dissociation constant of 1.7 x 10<sup>\"</sup>'\u00b0 M. These data are similar to those reported previously (Paetz A et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 338: 181 1-1817, 2005) and demonstrate that Fc\u03b3RIA-CH6 binds with high affinity to human IgG 1.</p>[384] Mast cells are thought to mediate immune complex-mediated inflammation in a variety of immune disorders such as type III hypersensitivity reactions (Ravetch, J. Clin. Invest. 1 10:1759-1761, 2002; Sylvestre and Ravetch, Immunity 5:387-390, 1996; Jancar and Crespo, Trends Immunology 26:48-55, 2005). Binding of immune complexes to mast cell Fc\u03b3 receptors is thought to induce the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 (Ravetch, supra; Jancar and Crespo, supra), which subsequently leads to neutrophil infiltration and tissue damage. To evaluate whether cytokine secretion from mast cells could be stimulated by immune complexes, the murine mast cell line MC/9 was incubated in the presence and absence of preformed rabbit anti- OVA/OVA immune complexes. Incubation with anti-OVA/OVA immune complexes produced a time and concentration dependent increase in the accumulation of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL- 13, TNF\u03b1, and MCP-I within the MC/9 cell conditioned media. Cytokine production was not altered, in contrast, when MC/9 cells were incubated with an equivalent concentration of rabbit anti- OVA IgG alone. These data demonstrate that MC/9 cells respond to immune complexes by the production of inflammatory "
