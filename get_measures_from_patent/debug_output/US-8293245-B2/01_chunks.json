    "zed in vitro.</p>The splenocytes of the immunized host animal (e.g., a mouse) are extracted and fused with a suitable myeloma cell line using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell (Goding (1986) Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, pp. 59-103, Academic Press). Any suitable myeloma cell line may be employed in accordance with the present invention; however, preferred myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level production of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. Among these, preferred myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines, such as those derived from MOPC-21 and MPC-11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif. USA, and SP-2 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md. USA.</p>The hybridoma cells thus prepared may be seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, parental myeloma cells. The hybridoma cells obtained through such a selection and/or culture medium in which the hybridoma cells are being maintained can then be assayed to identify production of monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind the 13C4 epitope. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) or using a Biacore. The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson and Rodbard (1980) Anal Biochem. 107: 220-239.</p>After hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity, affinity, and/or activity, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (Goding, supra). In addition, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal. The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium, ascites fluid, or serum by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxyapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography.</p>DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies of the invention is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The hybridoma cells of the invention serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as E. coli cells, COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, to obtain",
    "e, Johnson and Chiswell (1993) Curr Opin Struct Biol. 3: 564-571. Several sources of V-gene segments can be used for phage display. Clackson et al. (1991) Nature 352: 624-628 isolated a diverse array of anti-oxazolone antibodies from a small random combinatorial library of V genes derived from the spleens of immunized mice. A repertoire of V genes from non-immunized human donors can be constructed and antibodies to a diverse array of antigens (including self-antigens) can be isolated essentially following the techniques described by Marks et al. (1991) J Mol Biol. 222: 581-597, or Griffith et al. (1993) EMBO J. 12: 725-734.</p>The invention provides functionally-active fragments, derivatives or analogues of the immunoglobulin molecules which specifically bind to a protein that includes the 13C4 epitope. Functionally-active in this context means that the fragment, derivative or analogue is able to induce anti-anti-idiotype antibodies (i.e. tertiary antibodies) that recognize the same antigen that is recognized by the antibody from which the fragment, derivative or analogue is derived. Specifically, in a preferred embodiment, the antigenicity of the idiotype of the immunoglobulin molecule may be enhanced by deletion of framework and CDR sequences that are C-terminal to the CDR sequence that specifically recognizes the antigen. To determine which CDR sequences bind the antigen, synthetic peptides containing the CDR sequences can be used in binding assays with the antigen by any binding assay method known in the art.</p>The present invention provides antibody fragments such as, but not limited to, F(ab\u2032)<sub>2</sub>, F(ab)<sub>2</sub>, Fab\u2032, Fab, and scFvs. Antibody fragments which recognize specific epitopes may be generated by known techniques, e.g., by pepsin or papain-mediated cleavage.</p>The invention also provides heavy chain and light chain dimers of the antibodies of the invention, or any minimal fragment thereof such as Fvs or single chain antibodies (SCAs) (e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778; Bird (1988) Science 242: 423-42; Huston et al. (1988) Proc Natl Acad Sci. U.S.A. 85: 5879-5883; and Ward et al. (1989) Nature 334: 544-54), or any other molecule with the same specificity as the antibody of the invention. Single chain antibodies are formed by linking the heavy and light chain fragments of the Fv region via an amino acid bridge, resulting in a single chain polypeptide. Techniques for the assembly of functional Fv fragments in E. coli may be used (Skerra et al. (1988) Science 242: 1038-1041).</p>Alternatively, a clone encoding at least the Fab portion of the antibody may be obtained by screening Fab expression libraries (e.g., as described in Huse et al. (1989) Science 246: 1275-1281) for clones of Fab fragments that bind the specific antigen or by screening antibody libraries (see, e.g., Clackson et al. (1991) Nature 352: 624-628; Hanes and Pluckthun (1997) Proc Natl Acad Sci. U.S.A. 94: 4937-4942).</p>In other embodiments, "
