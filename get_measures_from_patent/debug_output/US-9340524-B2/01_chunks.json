    "dvantages of the compound, methods and compositions described herein will become apparent from the following detailed description. It should be understood, however, that the detailed description and the specific examples, while indicating specific embodiments, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the instant disclosure will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description.</p>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONAndrogen receptor (AR) is a member of the steroid and nuclear receptor superfamily. Among this large family of proteins, only five vertebrate steroid receptors are known and include the androgen receptor, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, and mineralocorticoid receptor. AR is a soluble protein that functions as an intracellular transcriptional factor. AR function is regulated by the binding of androgens, which initiates sequential conformational changes of the receptor that affect receptor-protein interactions and receptor-DNA interactions.</p>AR is mainly expressed in androgen target tissues, such as the prostate, skeletal muscle, liver, and central nervous system (CNS), with the highest expression level observed in the prostate, adrenal gland, and epididymis. AR can be activated by the binding of endogenous androgens, including testosterone and 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone (5\u03b1-DHT).</p>The androgen receptor (AR), located on Xq11-12, is a 110 kD nuclear receptor that, upon activation by androgens, mediates transcription of target genes that modulate growth and differentiation of prostate epithelial cells. Similar to the other steroid receptors, unbound AR is mainly located in the cytoplasm and associated with a complex of heat shock proteins (HSPs) through interactions with the ligand-binding domain. Upon agonist binding, AR goes through a series of conformational changes: the heat shock proteins dissociate from AR, and the transformed AR undergoes dimerization, phosphorylation, and translocation to the nucleus, which is mediated by the nuclear localization signal. Translocated receptor then binds to the androgen response element (ARE), which is characterized by the six-nucleotide half-site consensus sequence 5\u2032-TGTTCT-3\u2032 spaced by three random nucleotides and is located in the promoter or enhancer region of AR gene targets. Recruitment of other transcription co-regulators (including co-activators and co-repressors) and transcriptional machinery further ensures the transactivation of AR-regulated gene expression. All of these processes are initiated by the ligand-induced conformational changes in the ligand-binding domain.</p>AR signaling is crucial for the development and maintenance of male reproductive organs including the prostate gland, as genetic males harboring loss of function AR mutations and mice engineered with AR defects do not develop prostates or prostate cancer. This dependence of prostate cells on "
