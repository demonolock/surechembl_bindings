By displaying activity at these concentrations, compounds of the present invention are expected to be useful in the treatment of human diseases associated with chemokines and their cognate receptors. Potencies can be calculated and expressed as either inhibition constants (Ki values) or as IC<sub>50</sub> values, and refer to activity measured employing the assay system(s) described below.</p>Antagonism of MIP-1\u03b1 Binding to Human THP-1 Cells(Yoshimura et al., J. Immunol., 1990, 145, 292)Compounds of the present invention have activity in the antagonism of MIP-1\u03b1 binding to human THP-1 cells described here.</p>Millipore filter plates (#MABVN1250) are treated with 100 \u00b5l of binding buffer (0.5% bovine serum albumin, 20 mM HEPES buffer and 5 mM magnesium chloride in RPMI 1640 media) for thirty minutes at room temperature. To measure binding, 50 \u00b5l of binding buffer, with or without a known concentration of compound, is combined with 50 \u00b5l of <sup>125</sup>-I labeled human MIP-1\u03b1 (to give a final concentration of 50 pM radioligand) and 50 \u00b5l of binding buffer containing 5x10<sup>5</sup> cells. Cells used for such binding assays can include the THP-1 cell line, which expresses the endogenous CCR1 receptor, or human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation, or human monocytes (Weiner et al., J. Immunol. Methods, 1980, 36, 89). The mixture of compound, cells and radioligand is incubated at room temperature for thirty minutes. Plates are placed onto a vacuum manifold, vacuum applied, and the plates washed three times with binding buffer containing 0.5M NaCl. The plastic skirt is removed from the plate, the plate allowed to air dry, the wells punched out and counted. The percent inhibition of binding is calculated using the total counts obtained in the absence of any competing compound and the background binding determined by addition of 100 nM MIP-1\u03b1 in place of the test compound.</p>Antagonism of MIP-1\u03b1-induced Calcium Influx(Sullivan et al., Methods Mol. Biol., 114, 125-133 (1999)Compounds of the present invention have activity in the antagonism of MIP-1\u03b1-induced calcium influx assay described here.</p>Calcium mobilization is measured using the fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator dye, fluo-3. Cells used can include cell lines that express the endogenous CCR1 receptor such as MonoMac-6 cells and THP-1 cells, or freshly obtained human monocytes isolated as described by Weiner et al., J. Immunol. Methods, 36, 89-97 (1980). The cells are incubated at 8 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 20 mM HEPES buffer, 5 mM glucose, 1% fetal bovine serum, 4 \u00b5M fluo-3 AM and 2.5 mM probenecid for 60 minutes at 37 \u00b0C. After washing three times in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 20 mM HEPES, 5 mM glucose and 2.5 mM probenecid, the cells are resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 20 mM HEPES and 2.5 mM probenecid at a final concentration of 2-4 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL. Cells are plated into 96-well, black-wall microplates (100 \u00b5l/well) and the plates centrifuged at 200 x g for 5 minutes. Various graded concentrations of compound are added to the wells (50 \u00b5l/well) and after 5 minutes, 50 \u00b5l/well of MIP-1\u03b1 is added to give a final concentration of 10 nM. Calcium mobilization occurs immediately after addition of ligand and is detected using a fluorescent-imaging plate reader, utilizing an argon laser (488 nm). Cell-associated fluorescence is measured for 3 minutes (every second for the first 90 seconds and every 10 seconds for the next 90 seconds). Data are generated as arbitrary fluorescence units and the change in fluorescence for each well determined as the maximum-minimum differential. Compound-dependent inhibition is calculated relative to the response of MIP-1\u03b1 alone.</p>Antagonism of MIP-1\u03b1-induced THP-1 Cells ChemotaxisCompounds of the present invention have activity in the antagonism of MIP-1\u03b1-induced THP-1 cells chemotaxis assay described here.</p>BD Falcon HTX Fluoroblok 96-Multiwell Insert System plates (8 micron, catalog #351164) are warmed in a 37 \u00b0C incubator. After centrifugation, THP-1 cells (1.5 x 10<sup>7</sup> cells per plate) are resuspended in 1 mL of RPMI 1640 medium (without phenol red). 5 \u00b5l of 1 mg/mL calcein-AM (Molecular Probes catalog#C-3100) are added to the cell suspension. After mixing gently, the cells are incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 minutes. 14 mL of RPMI 1640 (with 0.1% BSA) are added and the cells centrifuged at 1300 rpm for 5 minutes. The pellet is resuspended in 7.5 mL of pre-warmed RPMI 1640 (with 0.1% BSA). A 20 nM solution of human MIP-1\u03b1 is also warmed at 37 \u00b0C. Compounds are diluted in RPMI 1640 to give concentrations twice the final values. The THP-1 cell suspension and the 20 nM MIP-1\u03b1 solution are mixed 1:1 in polypropylene tubes with pre-warmed RPMI with or without a dilution of the test compounds. These mixtures are warmed in a 37 \u00b0C tube warmer. 50 \u00b5l of the cell suspension + compound are added to each of the insert wells. 225 \u00b5l of MIP-1\u03b1 + compound are added to the lower reservoirs of the BD-Falcon Fluoroblok. The Fluoroblok plate is placed in a 37 \u00b0C incubator, incubated for 60 minutes and read in a Cytofluor II Fluorescence Multi-Well Plate Reader (PerSeptive Biosystems, Inc.) under instrumental settings of excitation wavelength at 485 nm and detection wavelength at 530 nm. Data are generated as arbitrary fluorescence units and the change in fluorescence for each well determined as the maximum-background differential. Compound-dependent inhibition is calculated relative to the response of MIP-1\u03b1 alone.</p>Mammalian chemokine receptors provide a target for interfering with or promoting immune cell function in a mammal, such as a human. Compounds that inhibit or promote chemokine receptor function are particularly useful for modulating immune cell function for therapeutic purposes.</p>Accordingly, the present invention is directed to compounds which are useful in the prevention and/or treatment of a wide variety of inflammatory, infectious, and immunoregulatory disorders and diseases, including asthma and allergic diseases, infection by pathogenic microbes (which, by definition, includes viruses), as well as autoimmune pathologies such as the rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis.</p>For example, an instant compound which inhibits one or more functions of a mammalian chemokine receptor (e.g., a human chemokine receptor) may be administered to inhibit (i.e., reduce or prevent) inflammation or infectious disease. As a result, one or more inflammatory process, such as leukocyte emigration, adhesion, chemotaxis, exocytosis (e.g., of enzymes, histamine) or inflammatory mediator release, is inhibited.</p>Similarly, an instant compound which promotes one or more functions of the mammalian chemokine receptor (e.g., a human chemokine) as administered to stimulate (induce or enhance) an immune or inflammatory response, such as leukocyte emigration, adhesion, chemotaxis, exocytosis (e.g., of enzymes, histamine) or inf",
    "cariasis, Hookworm, Strongyloidiasis, Trichinosis, filariasis); trematodes (flukes) (Schistosomiasis, Clonorchiasis), cestodes (tape worms) (Echinococcosis, Taeniasis saginata, Cysticercosis); visceral worms, visceral larva migraines (e.g., Toxocara), eosinophilic gastroenteritis (e.g., Anisaki sp., Phocanema sp.), cutaneous larva migraines (Ancylostona braziliense, Ancylostoma caninum). The compounds of the present invention are accordingly useful in the prevention and treatment of a wide variety of inflammatory, infectious and immunoregulatory disorders and diseases.</p>In addition, treatment of the aforementioned inflammatory, allergic and autoimmune diseases can also be contemplated for promoters of chemokine receptor function if one contemplates the delivery of sufficient compound to cause the loss of receptor expression on cells through the induction of chemokine receptor internalization or delivery of compound in a manner that results in the misdirection of the migration of cells.</p>In another aspect, the instant invention may be used to evaluate the putative specific agonists or antagonists of a G protein coupled receptor. The present invention is directed to the use of these compounds in the preparation and execution of screening assays for compounds that modulate the activity of chemokine receptors. Furthermore, the compounds of this invention are useful in establishing or determining the binding site of other compounds to chemokine receptors, e.g., by competitive inhibition or as a reference in an assay to compare its known activity to a compound with an unknown activity. When developing new assays or protocols, compounds according to the present invention could be used to test their effectiveness. Specifically, such compounds may be provided in a commercial kit, for example, for use in pharmaceutical research involving the aforementioned diseases. The compounds of the instant invention are also useful for the evaluation of putative specific modulators of the chemokine receptors. In addition, one could utilize compounds of this invention to examine the specificity of G protein coupled receptors that are not thought to be chemokine receptors, either by serving as examples of compounds which do not bind or as structural variants of compounds active on these receptors which may help define specific sites of interaction.</p>The compounds of the present invention are used to treat or prevent disorders selected from rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, septic shock, atherosclerosis, aneurysm, fever, cardiovascular effects, haemodynamic shock, sepsis syndrome, post ischemic reperfusion injury, malaria, Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel diseases, mycobacterial infection, meningitis, psoriasis, congestive heart failure, fibrotic diseases, cachexia, graft rejection, autoimmune diseases, skin inflammatory diseases, multiple sclerosis, radiation damage, hyperoxic alveolar injury, HIV, HIV dementia, non-insulin dependent diabetes melitus, asthm"
