    "The FSH content of samples was analysed by Western blotting: Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and a standard Western blot was performed using rabbit anti human FSH (AHP519, Serotec) or mouse anti human FSH-\u03b2 (MCA338, Serotec) as primary antibody, and an ImmunoPure Ultra Sensitive ABC Peroxidase Staining Kit (Pierce) for detection. Wild-type FSH produced as described above in Examples 1-3 was found to have the same mobility as FSH from references such as Puregon\u00ae (Organon) or Gonal-F\u00ae (Serono).</p>\n  For analysis of pl, samples were separated on pH 3-7 IEF gels (NO VEX). After electrophoresis, proteins were blotted onto Immobilon-P (Millipore) membranes and a West- em blot was performed as described above, using the same antibodies and detection kit. In accordance with published observations (see, for instance, Loumaye et al. (1998) Human Re- prod. Update 4, 862-881), various FSH isoforms were detected, mostly in the pH 4-5.2 range for wildtype FSH. This is due to heterogeneity in carbohydrate content, most importantly sialic acid.</p>\n  Example 5 Purification of FSH wildtype and variants</p>\n  Three chromatographic steps were employed to obtain highly purified FSH. First an anion exchanger step, then hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) and finally an immunoaffinity step using an FSH-\u03b2 specific monoclonal antibody.</p>\n  Culture supematants were prepared as described in Example 3. Filtered culture supematants were concentrated 10 to 20 times by ultrafiltration (10 kD cut-off membrane), pH was adjusted to 8.0 and conductivity to 10 - 15 mS/cm, before application on a DEAE Sepharose (Pharmacia) anion exchanger column, which had been equilibrated in ammonium \n\nacetate buffer (0.16 M, pH 8.0). Semipurified FSH was recovered both in the unbound flow- through fraction as well as in the wash fraction using 0.16 M ammonium acetate, pH 8.0. The flow through and wash fractions were pooled and ammonium sulfate was added from a stock solution (4.5 M) to obtain a final concentration of 1.5 M (N\u0397_<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S\u03b8<sub>4</sub>. The pH was adjusted to 7.0.</p>\n  The partially purified FSH was subsequently applied on a 25 ml butyl Sepha- rose (Pharmacia) HIC column. After application, the column was washed with at least 3 column volumes of 1.5 M (NH )<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 20 mM ammonium acetate, pH 7 (until the absorbance at 280 nm reached baseline level) and FSH was eluted with 4 column volumes of buffer B (20 mM ammonium acetate, pH 7). FSH enriched fractions from the HIC step were pooled, concentrated and diafiltrated using Vivaspin 20 modules, 10 kD cut-off membrane (Vivascience), to a 50 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCI, pH 7.2.</p>\n  For the third chromatographic step, an anti-FSH-\u03b2 monoclonal antibody (RDI- FSH909, Research Diagnostics) was immobilized to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Pharmacia) using a standard procedure from the supplier. Approximately 1 mg antibody was coupled per ml resin. The immunoaffinity resin was packed in plastic columns and equilibrated with 50 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCI, pH 7.2 before application.</p>\n  The buffer exchanged eluate from the butyl HIC step was applied on the antibody column by use of gravity flow. This was followed by several washing steps in 50 mM sodium phosphate solutions (0.5 M NaCI and 1 M NaCI, both pH 7.2). Elution was performed using either 1 M NH<sub>3</sub> or 0.6 M NH<sub>3</sub>, 40% (v/v) isopropanol and the eluate was immediately neutralized with 1 M acetic acid to pH 6-8.</p>\n  The purified FSH bulk product was concentrated and diafiltrated using Vivaspin 20 modules, 10 kD cut-off membrane (Vivascience), to a 50 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCI, pH 7.2. For subsequent storage, BSA was added to 0.1% (w/v) and the purified FSH was microfiltrated using a 0.22 \u03bcm filter prior to storage at - 80\u00b0C.</p>\n  SDS-PAGE, run under non-dissociating conditions (without boiling), showed wildtype FSH migrating as an apparant 42\u00b13 kDa band, slightly diffuse due to heterogeneity in the attached carbohydrates. The purity was about 80-90%. N-terminal sequencing showed that the \u03b1-chain had the expected N-terminal sequence starting with residue 1 (SEQ ID NO: 2) and the \u03b2-chain starting with residue 3 (SEQ ID NO:4). These N-terminal sequences have \n\nbeen found previously for recombinant FSH produced in CHO cells (Olijve, W. et al. (1996) Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2, 371-382).</p>\n  Example 6 FSH in vitro activity assay</p>\n  6.1 FSH assay Outline</p>\n  It has previously been published that activation of the FSH receptor by FSH leads to an increase in the intracellular concentration of cAMP. Consequently, transcription is activated at promoters containing multiple copies of the cAMP response element (CRE). It is thus possible to measure FSH activity by use of a CRE luciferase reporter gene introduced into CHO cells expressing the FSH receptor.</p>\n  6.2 Construction of a CHO FSH-R / CRE-luc cell line</p>\n  Stable clones expressing the human FSH receptor were produced by transfec- tion of CHO Kl cells with a plasmid containing the receptor cDNA inserted into pcDNA3 (Invitro"
