    "buffer containing 20mM Hepes pH 7.5,150mM NaCl using a Superdex 20010/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) calibrated with globular proteins of known molecular weight (GE Healthcare, 28-4038-41/42). The protein (50. mu.M) and ligand (6S +2S) -PEG1 (25. mu.M), (6R +2R) -PEG1 (100. mu.M), JQ1 (100. mu.M) or DMSO were mixed and incubated at 20 \u2103 for 20 minutes, followed by injection. The peak was monitored using UV absorbance at 280 nm. BRD4(1,2) and Domain mutant BRD4(1) <sup>MUT</sup> 2) and BRD4(1,2) <sup>MUT</sup> ) (corresponding to the N140A and N433A mutants, respectively) were analysed using the same method, but 42. mu.M protein was used with half the equivalent of MT 1.</p>Isothermal titration calorimetry</p>The experiment was performed on an Auto-ITC200 titration microcalorimeter (Malvern Instruments). All experiments were performed at 25 \u2103 while stirring at 1000rpm in ITC buffer (50mM HEPES pH 7.4, 25 \u2103,150mM NaCl). The microsyringe was loaded with a solution of the ligand sample. All titrations were performed using an initial injection of 0.4 \u03bc \u0399 followed by 19 identical injections of 2.0 \u03bc \u0399 for a duration of 4 seconds (each injection) with an interval of 120 seconds between the injections. The heat of dilution was determined by independent titration (ligand into buffer) and subtracted from the experimental data. Data collected in MicroCal provided with the instrument  <sup>TM</sup> Analysis was performed in Origin software to generate the binding enthalpy (. DELTA.H) and binding constant (KB) previously described by Wiseman and colleagues (see, e.g., Wiseman et al, Analytical biochemistry 1989, 179, 131-. Thermodynamic parameters were calculated (\u0394 G \u2550 \u0394 H-T \u0394 S \u2550 RTlnKB where \u0394 G, \u0394 H and \u0394 S are changes in free energy, binding enthalpy and binding entropy, respectively). In all cases, a single binding site model was usedAnd (4) molding.</p>Study of receptor analysis</p>Using the manufacturer's protocol, a selective assay (expresssprrofile) was performed at 1 \u03bc M for 55 ligand receptors, ion channels and transporters on MT1 by CEREP (Eurofins, Paris, France).</p>Statistical and animal model elucidation</p>For all experiments, the number of repetitions (n), the center value, the error bars and the p-value cutoff are depicted in the corresponding legends. Error bars for all data points are displayed in duplicate as a measure of variation within each data set. All t-tests performed were Welch's t-tests, which allowed assumptions to follow the unequal variance and distribution of Student's t distributions. These assumptions are not contradictory to the data. All t-tests were two-sided. There is no statistical method for predetermining the sample size. The experiment was not random and the investigator was not blinded to the configuration during the experiment and evaluation of the results. Animal experiments were performed according to the Dana-Farber cancer institute animal Care and use Committee approved protocol 13-053 and in compliance with "
