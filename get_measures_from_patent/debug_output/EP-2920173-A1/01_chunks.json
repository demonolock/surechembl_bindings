Tissue Culture. SK-N-MC cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C in 5% C0<sub>2</sub> as a monolayer in medium consisting of MEM with Earle's salts and L-glutamine (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). </p>Membrane Preparation. Crude membranes were prepared from SK-N-MC cells expressing CGRP receptors. The cells were rinsed twice with phosphate -buffered saline (155 mM NaCl, 3.3 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HP0<sub>4</sub>, 1.1 mM KH<sub>2</sub>P0<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.4), and incubated for 5-10 min. at 4 \u00b0C in hypotonic lysis buffer consisting of 10 mM Tris (pH 7.4) and 5 mM EDTA. The cells were transferred from plates to polypropylene tubes (16 x 100 mm) and homogenized using a polytron. Homogenates were centrifuged at 32,000 x g for 30 min. The pellets were resuspended in cold hypotonic lysis buffer with 0.1% mammalian protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) and assayed for protein concentration. The SK-N-MC homogenate was aliquoted and stored at -80 \u00b0C. </p>Radioligand Binding Assay. The compounds of invention were solubilized and carried through serial dilutions using 100%) DMSO. Aliquots from the compound serial dilutions were further diluted 25 fold into assay buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.005% Triton X-100) and transferred (volume 50 \u03bc\u0390) into 96 well assay plates. [<sup>125</sup>I]-CGRP (GE Healthcare or Perkin-Elmer) was diluted to 72 pM in assay buffer and a volume of 50 \u03bc\u0390 was added to each well. SK-N-MC membranes were thawed, diluted in assay buffer with fresh 0.1% mammalian protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma), and re -homogenized. SK-N-MC homogenate (7 \u03bcg/well) was added in a volume of 100 \u03bc\u0390. The assay plates were then incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Assays were stopped by addition of excess cold wash buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 0.1% BSA) immediately followed by filtration over glass fiber filters (Whatman GF/B) previously soaked in 0.5%&gt; PEL Non-specific binding was defined with 1 \u03bc\u039c beta-CGRP (Bachem). Protein bound radioactivity was determined using a gamma or scintillation counter. The resulting data was analyzed \n\n using a four parameter competitive binding equation (XLfit v2.0) and the IC<sub>50</sub> was defined as the concentration of a compound of invention required to displace 50% of radioligand binding. Final assay concentration of [<sup>125</sup>I]-CGRP was 18 pM. The mean Kd for [<sup>125</sup>I]-CGRP is 25.4 pM. All compounds of invention were evaluated in at least two separate experiments. See table 1 for data summary. </p>Table 1. Human CGRP Binding </p></p>Pharmaceutical Compositions and Methods of Treatment </p>The compounds of Formula I inhibit the CGRP receptor. As such, they are useful for treating conditions or disorders associated with aberrant CGRP levels or where modulating CGRP levels may have therapeutic benefit. </p>Accordingly, another aspect of the invention is a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of Formula I with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, carrier, or diluent. </p>Compounds are generally given as pharmaceutical compositions comprised of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and may contain conventional exipients. A therapeutically effective amount is the amount needed to provide a meaningful patient benefit as determined by practitioners in that art. </p>Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are those conventionally known carriers having acceptable safety profiles. Compositions encompass all common solid and liquid forms including capsules, tablets, losenges, and powders as well as liquid \n\n suspensions, syrups, elixers, and solutions. Solid compositions may by formed in timed or sustained released formulations. Compositions are made using common formulation techniques and conventional excipient"
