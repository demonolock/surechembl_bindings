{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nThe test compounds are prepared in neat DMSO at a concentration of 10 mM. \nFor inhibition curves, compounds are diluted using a three fold serial dilution and tested at 11 concentrations (e.g. 25 \u03bc\u039c- 0.42 nM). \nCurves are analysed using ActivityBase and XLfit, and results are expressed as pIC50 values. \n\n\nNote that these sentences do not contain a specific molecule name or ID, but they do contain information about bioactivity metrics (IC50) and units (\u03bc\u039c, nM, mM). If you would like to extract only sentences that contain a specific molecule name or ID, the result would be empty, as there are no such sentences in the provided text snippet."}
