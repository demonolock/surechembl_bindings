This assay is run as a 10 \u03bc\u0390. endpoint assay in 384-well format, where the reaction contains 20 \u03bc\u039c malonyl-CoA, 2 \u03bc\u039c acetyl- CoA, 30 \u03bc\u039c NADPH and 40 nM FAS in 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. The assay is run by sequentially dispensing 5 \u03bc\u0390 of a malonyl-CoA solution, then enzyme solution (containing the acetyl-CoA, and NADPH) into a black, low volume assay plate (Greiner 784076) pre-dispensed with 100 nL compound solutions in DMSO. The reaction is incubated at ambient temperature for 60 minutes, then quenched with 5 \u03bc\u03af of a developing solution composed of 90 \u03bc\u039c resazurin, 0.3 IU/ml diaphorase in 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. The developed reaction is read on a Molecular Devices \n\n Analyst or Acquest (or equivalent) plate reader using a 530 nm excitation wavelength filter, a 580 nm emission filter, and 561 nm dichroic filter. The test compounds are prepared in neat DMSO at a concentration of 10 mM. For inhibition curves, compounds are diluted using a three fold serial dilution and tested at 11 concentrations (e.g. 25 \u03bc\u039c- 0.42 nM). Curves are analysed using ActivityBase and XLfit, and results are expressed as pIC50 values. </p>Assay #2: </p> Inhibition of FAS can also be quantified based on the detection of the CoA products with a thio-reactive coumarin dye. This assay is run as a 10 \u03bc\u03af endpoint assay in 384-well format, where the reaction contains 20 \u03bc\u039c malonyl-CoA, 20 \u03bc\u039c acetyl-CoA, 40 \u03bc\u039c NADPH and 2 nM FAS in 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 0.04% Tween- 20. The assay is run by adding 5 \u03bcL\u00b7 enzyme solution to a black, low volume assay plate (Greiner 784076) pre-dispensed with 100 nl compound solutions in DMSO. After 30 minutes, 5 \u03bcL\u00b7 substrate is added, and the reaction incubated at ambient temperature for an additional 60 minutes. The reaction is then quenched with 10 \u03bc\u03af of 6M guanidine- HC1 containing 50 \u03bc\u039c CPM (7-diethylamino-3-(4'-maleimidylphenyl)-4- methylcoumarin (CPM; thio-reactive dye), and incubated for 30 minutes. The plate is read on an Envision (PerkinElmer) or equivalent plate reader using a 380 nm excitation wavelength filter, and a 486 nm emission filter. Data fitting and compound preparations are done as described above. </p>Lipogenesis assay </p>Cultured primary human pre-adipocytes (Zen-Bio, Cat# ASC062801) are plated at confluence (3x10<sup>4</sup> cells/well) in 96-well plates (Costar, Cat# 3598) coated with 0.2% gelatin (Sigma, Cat# G-6650) in DMEM/F12 medium (InvitroGen Cat# 11330-032) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (InvitroGen, Cat# 16000- 044).
