{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences/rows that meet the criteria:\n\n\nThe IC50 given in table 2 above are expressed as:\n++++: IC50 \u2264 100 nM\n+++: 100 &lt; IC50 \u2264 500 nM\n++: 500 &lt; IC50 \u2264 1000 nM\n+: IC50 &gt; 1000 nM\n\n\nNote that the table rows themselves do not contain specific molecule names, but the table description does mention \"compounds of formula (I)\". However, without a specific molecule name or ID, these rows do not meet the criteria. The extracted sentence above describes the IC50 values and units, but it does not contain a specific molecule name or ID. \n\nAfter re-reading the text, I found that there are no sentences that meet all four criteria. The text does not provide specific IC50 values with units for specific molecule names or IDs. The table describes the IC50 values in a general way, but it does not provide specific values with units for specific molecules."}
