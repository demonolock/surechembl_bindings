MethodsCell-based proliferation screening of compoundsCellTiter-Blue cell-based survival/proliferation assay (Promega G8080) was performed on tumor cell lines. A total of 1.10<sup>4</sup> cells/well/50\u00b5l were seeded in a 96-wells plate. Treatment was initiated by addition of a 2x drug solution of 1/10 serial dilutions ranging from 0 to 10\u00b5M. Cells were grown for 48h at 37\u00b0C and then incubated with 10 \u00b5l/well of Promega CellTiter-Bleue reagent for 4 h at 37\u00b0C. The amount of resorufin dye formed was quantified by its fluorescence emission at 590 nm using a scanning multiwell spectrophotometer (OPTIMA, BMG labtech, France). A blank well without cells was used as a background control for the spectrophotometer.</p>Examples of cell lines testedA375, A4513, A498, A549, ACHN, AGS, BT20, BXPC3, CALU6, CLS354, DLD1, DU145, H1299, HCT116, HEP2, HEPG2, HGC27, HL60, HUT78, KARPAS299, MDAMB231, MELWO, MESSA, OPM2, PANC1, PC3, PLCPRF5, REC1, RL, SW579, TOV112D, U118, U2OS, U87MG.</p>B.3.
