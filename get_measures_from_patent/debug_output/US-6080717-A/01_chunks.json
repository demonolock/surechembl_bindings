    "p>,2).</p>2. The full acylation reaction can also be measured by analysing production of either PPi or AMP which are produced in stoichiometric ratio to the tRNA acylation. This may be achieved in a number of ways, for example using colorimetric<sup>3</sup> ; or enzyme coupled<sup>4</sup> measurement of Pi after addition of excess inorganic pyrophosphatase or using enzyme coupled assays to directly measure AMP or PPi productions<sup>5</sup>.</p>3. The partial reaction (a) can be assayed through radiolabel isotopic exchange between ATP and PPi, since each of the steps in this part of the reaction are freely reversible. This typically has a k<sub>cat</sub> around 20-fold higher than the full acylation reaction (a+b), and is readily measured using chromatographic principles which separate PPi from ATP (i.e. using activated charcoal<sup>1</sup>,2.</p>Ligand Binding to CRSIt is also possible to define ligand interactions with CRS in experiments that are not dependent upon enzyme catalysed turnover of substrates. This type of experiment can be done in a number of ways:</p>1. Effects of ligand blinding upon enzyme intrinsic fluorescence (e.g. of tryptophan). Binding of either natural ligands or inhibitors may result in enzyme conformational changes which alter enzyme fluorescence. Using stopped-flow fluorescence equipment, this can be used to define the microscopic rate constants that describe binding. Alternatively, steady-state fluorescence titration methods can yield the overall dissociation constant for binding in the same way that these are accessed through enzyme inhibition experiments.</p>2. Spectral effects of ligands. Where the ligands themselves are either fluorescent or possess chromophores that overlap with enzyme tryptophan fluorescence, binding can be detected either via changes in the ligand fluorescence properties (e.g. intensity, lifetime or polarisation) or fluorescence resonance energy transfer with enzyme tryptophans. The ligands could either be inhibitors or variants of the natural ligands (i.e. fluorescent ATP derivatives or tRNACys labelled with a fluorophore).</p>3. Thermal analysis of the enzyme: ligand complex. Using calorimetric techniques (e.g. Isothermal Calorimetry, Differential Scanning Calorimetry) it is possible to detect thermal changes, or shifts in the stability of CRS which reports and therefore allows the characterisation of ligand binding.</p>References1.

The latter contains around 10% of total protein as CRS. Enzyme is stored at -70\u00b0 C. in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer "
