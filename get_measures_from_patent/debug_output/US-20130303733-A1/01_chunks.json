    "e, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). For example, substitution of a phenylalanine for a tyrosine is a conservative substitution. In some embodiments, conservative substitutions in the sequences of the polypeptides and antibodies of the invention do not abrogate the binding of the polypeptide or antibody containing the amino acid sequence to the antigen(s) to which the polypeptide or antibody binds. Methods of identifying nucleotide and amino acid conservative substitutions and non-conservative substitutions which do not eliminate polypeptide or antigen binding are well-known in the art (see, e.g., Brummell et al., Biochem. 32:1180-1187 (1993); Kobayashi et al., Protein Eng. 12(10):879-884 (1999); and Burks et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94:412-417 (1997)).</p>A \u201cmodular recognition domain\u201d (MRD) or \u201ctarget binding peptide\u201d is a molecule, such as a protein, glycoprotein and the like, that can specifically (non-randomly) bind to a target molecule. The amino acid sequence of a MRD can typically tolerate some degree of variability and still retain a degree of capacity to bind the target molecule. Furthermore, changes in the sequence can result in changes in the binding specificity and in the binding constant between a preselected target molecule and the binding site. In one embodiment, the MRD is an agonist of the target it binds. An MRD agonist refers to a MRD that in some way increases or enhances the biological activity of the MRD's target protein or has biological activity comparable to a known agonist of the MRD's target protein. In another embodiment, the MRD is an antagonist of the target it binds. An MRD antagonist refers to an MRD that blocks or in some way interferes with the biological activity of the MRD's target protein or has biological activity comparable to a known antagonist or inhibitor of the MRD's target protein.</p>\u201cCell surface receptor\u201d refers to molecules and complexes of molecules capable of receiving a signal and the transmission of such a signal across the plasma membrane of a cell. An example of a cell surface receptor of the present invention is an activated integrin receptor, for example, an activated \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin receptor on a metastatic cell. As used herein, \u201ccell surface receptor\u201d also includes a molecule expressed on a cell surface that is capable of being bound by an MRD containing antibody of the invention.</p>As used herein, a \u201ctarget binding site\u201d or \u201ctarget site\u201d is any known, or yet to be defined, amino acid sequence having the ability to selectively bind a preselected agent. Exemplary reference target sites are derived from the RGD-dependent integrin ligands, namely fibronectin, fibrinogen, vitronectin, von Willebrand fac",
    "ody binds to a human target protein.</p>The antibodies in the MRD-containing antibodies are able to bind their respective targets when the MRDs are attached to the antibody. In certain embodiments, the antibody binds its target independently. In some embodiments, the antibody is a target agonist. In other embodiments, the antibody is a target antagonist.</p>It is contemplated that the antibodies used in the present invention may be prepared by any method known in the art. For example, antibody molecules and MRD-containing antibodies can be \u201crecombinantly produced,\u201d i.e., produced using recombinant DNA technology.</p>Monoclonal antibodies that can be used as the antibody component of the MRD-containing antibodies can be prepared using hybridoma methods, such as those described by Kohler and Milstein, Nature 256:495 (1975). Using the hybridoma method, a mouse, hamster, or other appropriate host animal, is immunized as described above to elicit the production by lymphocytes of antibodies that will specifically bind to an immunizing antigen. Lymphocytes can also be immunized in vitro. Following immunization, the lymphocytes are isolated and fused with a suitable myeloma cell line using, for example, polyethylene glycol, to form hybridoma cells that can then be selected away from unfused lymphocytes and myeloma cells. Hybridomas that produce monoclonal antibodies directed specifically against a chosen antigen as determined by immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, or by an in vitro binding assay (e.g., radioimmunoassay (RIA); enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)) can then be propagated either in vitro, for example, using standard methods (Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, Academic Press, 1986) or in vivo, for example, as ascites tumors in an animal. The monoclonal antibodies can then be purified from the culture medium or ascites fluid as described for polyclonal antibodies above.</p>Alternatively monoclonal antibodies can also be made using recombinant DNA methods, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567. For example, in one approach polynucleotides encoding a monoclonal antibody are isolated from mature B-cells or hybridoma cell, such as by RT-PCR using oligonucleotide primers that specifically amplify the genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody, and their sequence is determined using conventional procedures. The isolated polynucleotides encoding the heavy and light chains are then cloned into suitable expression vectors, which when transfected into host cells such as E. coli cells, simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, monoclonal antibodies are generated by the host cells. In other approaches, recombinant monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments having the desired immunoreactivity can be isolated from phage display libraries expressing CDRs of the desired species using techniques known in the art (McCaffer"
