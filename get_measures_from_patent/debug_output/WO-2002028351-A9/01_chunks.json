    "nded in 80 ml of the above buffer, 75 mg of EZ-link Biotin-PEO-Amine in 4 ml of buffer were added and mixed well by gentle stirring. 100 mg of EDC in 1 ml of buffer were then added and gently stirred at room temperature for 2h. The incubation mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 30 min and the supernatant saved as first extract. The bacterial pellet extracted at room temperature by stirring with PBS (phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.2) for 15 min. The extract was recovered by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 30 min and saved as second extract. Both extracts were desalted and concentrated to about 15 ml by centrifugation at 3,000 x g employing Centriplus YM3 concentrator.</p>Both the extracts (10 micro liter aliquot) were subjected SDS-PAGE/western \n\ntransfer to a PVDF membrane. The nonspecific binding sites on the membrane were then</p>blocked by incubation with bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. 1 ml aliquot</p>of Streptavidin Alkaline Phosphatase conjugate was added and incubated overnight at room</p>temperature with gentle shaking. Unbound conjugate was removed by washing the membrane</p>with TBS three times for 10 min each. The membrane was blotted dry on a filter paper and</p>transferred to the color development substrate solution (50 \u03bcl of NBT and 25 \u03bcl of BCIP in</p>7.5 ml of 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 100 mMNaCl, 5 mM MgC12). Positive bands appeared</p>as purple bands on the membrane.</p>The extracts (10 \u03bcl aliquot) were also subjected to the overlay binding assay</p>employing<sup>125</sup>I-labeled human nasopharyngeal mucin as described above.</p>The results showed that several proteins including mucin were labeled with</p>biotin. Overlay binding assay revealed that human nasopharyngeal mucin bound to low</p>molecular weight components which appeared to be 12 kDa and 14 kDa mucin binding proteins. These results indicate that the mucin binding proteins are located on the surface of the bacteria.</p>Point Mutation Studies. Point mutations are generated in a recombinant nucleotide</p>sequence by first generating a synthetic oligonucleotide, to be used as a primer, which flanks the nucleotide to be modified. The sequence of the synthetic oligonucleotide should exactly</p>match the target sequence, except for the base to be modified. Several kits are available for</p>the creation of single base pair changes and subsequent selection and expression of the</p>mutant sequence. A preferable system will utilize a high copy number plasmid, which among</p>others will have two antibiotic resistance genes. One antibiotic gene is inactive and is made active during the mutagenesis step with a synthetic oligonucleotide supplied by the company. \n\nThe other antibiotic gene is made inactive in a similar manner. A desirable vector also will have convenient cloning and translation start sites, as well as SP6, T7, and tac promoters for expression in E. coli.</p>Briefly, the sequence of interest is cloned \"in frame\" into such a vector and subjected</p>to alkaline denaturation to separate the strands. The synthetic oligo containing the base pair</p>change and the synthetic oligos containing the antibiotic resistance repair/mutagenesis "
