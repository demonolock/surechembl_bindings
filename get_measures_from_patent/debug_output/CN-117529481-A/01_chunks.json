The calculation formula of the ratio is: ratio = 665nm signal value/620 nm signal value x 10000. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software. The best fit curve was selected from log (agonist) vs. response. The EC50 values of the compounds were determined using a non-linear regression analysis of the computer-aided dose-response curve; pec50= -logEC50 (EC 50 value units are moles); maximum effect of% morphine = (compound sample ratio-blank hole ratio)/TOP x 100 (note: TOP value is curve TOP value fitted by software Graphpad Prism analysis after morpholinium sample ratio-blank hole ratio).
