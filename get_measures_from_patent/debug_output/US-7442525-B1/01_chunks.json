When EW5111 serum (diluted 1:100) was preincubated with a 1:10 dilution of the cell extracts from bacteria transformed with pTP31.2, prior to reaction with a virus blot, the viral p31 band was completely eliminated, while reactivity with other viral proteins remained unaffected. In contrast, extracts from bacteria transformed with the vector alone did not absorb out the p31 reactive antibodies. The viral p31 protein is thus the product of the C-terminal or endonuclease region of the pol gene of HIV-1.</p>3.5. Expression of SOD-p31 Fusion Protein</p>In order to generate a fused protein SOD-p31 that can be expressed in E. coli, 2 \u03bcl of the fragment ARV248NL were ligated to 100 ng of a NcoI-SalI digest of pSODCF<sub>2 </sub>[Steimer et al. (1986) J. Virol. 58: 9-16], a plasmid that contains the human SOD coding region under the regulation of the tacl promoter, in 20 \u03bcl final volume for 18 h at 14\u00b0 C. Competent D1210 cells were transformed with 5 \u03bcl of the ligation mix and colonies were selected on L-broth ampicillin plates. Colonies with the correct insert were called E. coli D1210 (pTSp31). The expression of the fusion protein was analyzed in the same manner as the direct expression of p31. The analysis showed production of large amounts of a protein of about 47 kd that is immunoreactive with EW5111 but not with normal human sera. Further characterization of the recombinant protein is described in Section 4.3.3.3.</p>3.6. Expression of SOD-env5b Fusion Protein</p>3.6.1. Host-Vector System</p>A hybrid protein consisting of human superoxide dismutase (SOD) fused to a viral envelope (env-5b) protein is synthesized by E. coli strain D1210 transformed with plasmid pSOD/env5b. Plasmid pSOD/env5b is a bacterial expression vector which contains the sequence coding for human SOD [Hallewell et al. (1985) Nucl. Acid. Res. 13:2017] fused to the env-5b region of the viral env gene [Sanchez-Pescador et al. (1985) Science 227: 484] as well as pBR322 sequences including the ampicillin resistant (amp<sup>R</sup>) gene.</p>Expression of SOD/env-5b fusion protein is non-constitutive and it is under transcriptional control of a hybrid tac promoter [De Boer et al. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80: 21-25] derived from sequences of the trp and the lac UV5 promoters. Expression of SOD/env-5b is induced in bacterial transformants with IPTG.</p>E. coli D1210, a lac-repressor overproducing strain, carries the lacI and lacY<sup>+</sup> alleles on the chromosome but otherwise is identical to E. coli HB101 (F<sup>\u2212</sup> lacI<sup>+</sup>, lacO<sup>+</sup>, lacY<sup>\u2212</sup>, gal<sup>\u2212</sup>, pro<sup>\u2212</sup>, leu<sup>\u2212</sup>, thi<sup>\u2212</sup>, end<sup>\u2212</sup>, hsm<sup>\u2212</sup>, hsr<sup>\u2212</sup>, recA<sup>\u2212</sup>, rpsL<sup>\u2212</sup>) from which it was derived [Sadler",
    "4K).</p>4.1.5. Characterization of Recombinant envH</p>SDS polyacrylamide gel analysis (12% acrylamide gels) showed that a new 55,000 dalton protein was being synthesized in yeast cells transformed with the env-containing vector. The 55,000 dalton protein is absent from cells transformed with control plasmid (vector without env insert). The identity of env was confirmed by both ELISA (Section 3.1.6.3.) and Western analysis using AIDS patient serum. In both assays the 55,000 dalton protein showed immunoreactivity. No reactivity was obtained with serum from a normal individual.</p>4.2. Expression of env Subregion Polypeptides</p>The following example describes the expression of DNA coding regions defined as env-1, env-2, env-3, env-4 and env-5b (see FIG. 13). Env-1 and env-4 approximate the N- and C-terminal halves of gp120 env, respectively. Env-2 and env-3 approximate the entire env polypeptide moieties of gp120 and gp41, respectively. Env-5b corresponds to the region of gp41env thought to be external to the cell membrane.</p>4.2.1. Env-1</p>4.2.1.1. GAP Promoter</p>Proviral ARV-2 sequences were isolated from phage \u03bbARV-2 (7D) and subcloned into plasmid pUC19. Yanisch et al. (1985) Gene 33: 103-119. The plasmid containing the proviral sequences was named pUC19ARV7D/7. To isolate the env-1 region, the plasmid was cut with FokI at cys27 of the env region (nt5857, FIG. 5) and with BglII at arg276 (nt6604, FIG. 5). This provided a nucleotide segment with a coding capacity for 28 kD from the N-terminus of gp120 without the 29 amino acid signal sequence of the env gene product. A synthetic, NcoI/FokI adaptor, with the following sequence, was ligated to the env-1 segment:</p>5\u2032-CATGGCTATC\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003CGATAGACAT-5\u2032\nA second adaptor, for BglII/SalI, was also ligated to the env-1 segment. This second adaptor had the following sequence:\n</p>5\u2032-GATCTTGATAGG\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003AACTATCCAGCT-5\u2032\nThe first synthetic adaptor contains an in-frame initiation codon, and the second synthetic adaptor contains an in-frame stop codon.\n</p>The env-1 segment modified with the synthetic adaptors was then ligated into pPGAP1 previously linearized with NcoI and SalI. Plasmid pPGAP1 has been previously described. EPO Pub. No. 164,556. It contains a yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) promoter and terminator sequences flanking NcoI and SalI cloning sites. The ligation of the modified env-1 segment into pPGAP1 produces plasmid pPGAP/FGenv, which contains the env-1 sequence fused directly to the GAPDH promoter and terminator sequences. The expression cassette containing GAPDH promoter-env-1-GAPDH terminator was excised by digestion of pPGAP/FGenv with BamHI and gel purification of the fragment. The expression cassette was cloned into BamHI-digested pC1/1 (see Section 4.1.2) to yield pC1/1FGenv.</p>Plasmid pC1/1FGenv was used to transform yeast strain AB110 (Mata, ura 3-52, leu 2-04 or both leu 2-3 and leu 2-112, pep 4-3, h is 4-580, cir\u00b0; see EPO Pub. No. 620,662 &amp; Section 4.5.2) as described previously. Hinnen et al. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 75: 1929. Yeast colonies transformed with the expression plasmid were grown in synthetic complete media lacking leucine at a concentration of 2% glucose. Large-scale cultures were grown in YEP medium with 2% glucose as described in Section 4.1.3. Lysates were prepared from yeast cultures as described previously, and were then separated into soluble and insoluble fractions by centrifugation, and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, see Section 4.1.4. A heavily expressed protein corresponding to env-1 was readily discernible in the insoluble fraction by Coomassie blue staining. This protein also migrated at a molecular weight of approximately 28 kD, as predicted from the DNA sequence.</p>4.2.2. Env-2</p>The env-2 polypeptide is similar to the previously described envH (Section 4.1.1) and corresponds to the viral gp120 glycoprotein. Env-2 differs from envH in the 5 amino terminal residues and is under the regulatory control of the GAPDH promoter as described for the expression of env-1. Env-2 is a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence of gp120 env residues 26510.</p>4.2.2.1. Construction of PAB24-GAP-env2</p>Plasmid pAB24-GAP-env2 (FIG. 28) contains an \u201cexpression cassette\u201d for the env gene cloned into the BamHI site of the yeast shuttle vector pAB24 (below). Expression of the env gene is under regulatory control of the GAPDH promoter and the PYK terminator. Construction of pAB24-GAP-env2 was accomplished by ligating (i) an approximately 952 bp BamHI-StuI fragment from plasmid pC1/1-FGenv (Section 4.2.1) which contains the GAPDH promoter and the envelope sequences coding for amino acids 26-267, and (ii) an approximately 1474 bp StuI-BamHI fragment from plasmid pDPC302 (which is similar to pDPC303 in Section 4.1.1. except that it extends 57 nucleotides in the 3\u2032 direction of the envelope coding region), which codes for env amino acids 267-510 and the PYK terminator, into plasmid pAB24 which had been previously digested with BamHI and treated with alkaline phosphatase. The direction of transcription in the \u201cexpression cassette\u201d is in the opposite direction of the tetracycline gene of the pBR322 sequences.</p>Plasmi",

Strain AB116 was isolated by curing S. cerevisiae strain BJ2168 of its 2 micron plasmid by standard methods. BJ2168 is available from the Yeast Genetic Stock Center, Department of Biophysics and Medical Physics, University of California, Berkeley 94720.</p>Cultures were grown as follows: a loopfull of cells from the individual colonies were inoculated into 3 ml of Leu<sup>\u2212</sup>, 8% glucose media and incubated in an air shaker at 30\u00b0 C. for 16-18 h. The 3 ml culture was transferred to 40 ml of fresh Leu<sup>\u2212</sup>, 8% glucose media and incubated in an air shaker at 30\u00b0 for 24 h. The 40 ml culture was transferred to 1 liter of YEP, 1% glucose media (or YEP, 2.5% Ethanol media for 2150-2-3 cells) and incubated in an air shaker at 300 for an additional 48 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at \u221220\u00b0 C.</p>Expression of the SOD/env-4 fusion protein was analyzed by both polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blot. Cells are disrupted by glass bead lysis method in 0.1 M NaPO<sub>4 </sub>(pH 7.4), 0.1% Triton lysis buffer. After lysis the soluble and insoluble fractions are separated by centrifugation. The insoluble pellet is solubilized in Laemmli gel loading buffer and run on a 12.5% acrylamide SDS gel. Laemmli (1970) Nature 227: 680. A band migrating at approximately 44 Kd molecular weight (expected size of SOD/env-4 fusion protein) was observed. This same band also reacted on a western blot with AIDS positive human sera but not with control sera. Expression levels of SOD/env-4 fusion protein were approximately equal for the two different strains. Protein purification was carried out essentially as described in Section 4.2.2.3. for env-2.</p>4.2.5. YSOD/env-5b Fusion Protein</p>The region of the envelope gene corresponding to amino acids alanine-557 through tryptophan-677 is termed env-5b as described in Section 3.6 and is also expressed as a stable fusion protein with hSOD in yeast. A StuI-SalI fragment containing most of the SOD gene fused to the env-5b gene was removed from pSOD/env5b (Section 3.6) and cloned into pSI8 which had been previously digested with StuI and SalI and gel isolated to give pSI8/SOD-env5b. Plasmid pSI8 (described below) contains the ADH-2/GAPDH hybrid promoter and \u03b1-factor terminator sequences flanking the SOD-insulin fusion gene. The resulting plasmid, designated pSI8/SOD-env5b, was digested with BamHI and the fragment containing the promoter-ySOpenv-5b fusion-terminator was isolated and cloned into the BamHI cut and phosphatased pAB24 to give pYSOD/env-5b, which was used to transform the yeast strain 2150, as described above. Expression of the ySOD/env-5b fusion protein was induced by diluting a starter culture into YEP containing 1% ethanol.</p>Lysates were isolated and prepared as described above. A heavily expressed protein corresponding to the SOD/env-5 fusion was readily discerned in the insoluble fraction by Coomassie blue staining. This protein migrated at a molecular weight of approximately 30.6 kD, as predicted from its DNA sequence. This fusion protein was also subsequently shown to have a high proportion of reactivity to AIDS patients' sera.</p>Plasmid pSI8 is a derivative pYASI1, the latter being described in commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 845,737, filed on 28 Mar. 1986 by Cousens et al. and EPO Pub. No. 196,056, the disclosures of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference. Essentially, pSI8 contains: The hybrid ADH-2/GAPDH promoter (as a 1.3 kb Bam-Nco fragment) derived from plasmid pJS104 (described below); an SOD-insulin fusion gene (as a 736 bp Nco-Sal fragment) derived from a derivative of pYSI1 (U.S. Ser. No. 845,737); and the \u03b1-factor terminator isolated as a 277 bp SalI-EcoRI fragment in which the EcoRI site has been filled in with Klenow fragment and BamHI linkers ligated to give a SalI-BamHI fragment [Brake et al. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81: 4642-4646]; all cloned into a pBR322 derivative in which the segment between EcoRI and SalI is deleted and Bam linkers attached. Plasmid pJS104 is the same as plasmid pJS103 (Section 4.2.3.2), except that the GAPDH fragment of the ADH-2/GAPDH promoter is about 400 bp, as opposed to 200 bp. The construction of pJS104 was the same as pJS103, except that during the preparation of the GAPDH portion of the promoter, the 0.4 Kbp BamdI-EcoRI fragment was partially digested with AluI to create a blunt-end near the BamHI site.</p>4.2.6.

    "cells were grown in YEPD, washed in medium without adenine and about 6\u00d710<sup>8 </sup>cells were plated onto six adenine minus (ade<sup>\u2212</sup>) plates. Four candidate revertants were tested for other genetic markers by steaking on plates without uracyl (ura<sup>\u2212</sup>), plates with no leucine (leu<sup>\u2212</sup>), and minimal plates plus leucine. Growth was observed on ura<sup>\u2212</sup> and minimal plus leu plates; no growth was observed on leu<sup>\u2212</sup> plates. Revertants were crossed with strain AB103.1 (Mat a, pep 4-3, leu 2-3, leu 2-112, ura 3.52, h is 4-580) to determine if the reversion was due to extragenic suppression. Based on tetrad analysis, none of the four independent ade<sup>+</sup> revertants were due to extragenic suppression. Based on good growth and high spore viability, one of the revertants was selected and named PO17.</p>Three different kinds of inductions were tried: (1). P017 colonies were induced in either a 10 ml culture of YEP/1% glucose or a leu<sup>\u2212</sup>/3% ethanol culture for 24 h. The yeast pellets were analyzed by both polyacrylamide gels and Westerns and even though the Coomassie-stained gel showed a negative result, the Western did light up a band of the correct molecular weight with both induction methods. (2). PO17 colonies were induced in a 30 ml culture of YEP/1% ethanol for 48 h. Aliquots were analyzed by PAGE at various time points during the induction. The Coomassie-stained gel shows a band in the correct molecular weight range (47-50 kd) that appears after 14 h in YEP/1% ethanol and reaches a maximum intensity at 24 h of induction. The Western result correlates well with the Coomassie-stained gel, showing strong bands at 24 and 48 h. (3). AB110 colonies were induced in either leu<sup>\u2212</sup>/3% ethanol or YEP/1% glucose for 24 h. PAGE and Westerns were run and the results were negative for the PAGE and positive for the Western, in both induction methods.</p>Expression and immunoreactivity were characterized as described below.</p>Cells from one patch P017 (pC1/1-pSP31-GAP-ADH2) were inoculated in 50 ml of leu<sup>\u2212</sup>/7.1% glucose and grown overnight at 30\u00b0 C. The saturated culture was inoculated into 500 ml of the same leu<sup>\u2212</sup>/7.1% glucose medium and incubated overnight at 30\u00b0 C. The saturated 500 ml culture was used to inoculate a 10 L fermenter with YEPD. Cells were then harvested about five days later.</p>A sample of cells from the fermenter were analyzed by PAGE electrophoresis to determine expression levels of p31-SOD. In addition, Western analysis using a Trimar serum was performed on the samples to determine its immunoreactivity.</p>The following procedure was used to prepare samples for PAGE and Westerns:</p>a. Cells (4 g) were resuspended in 7 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF) in a centrifuge tube and 4 ml of yeast-size glass beads were added.</p>b. Cells were vortexed at top speed in a VWR vortex for 10 minutes (1 min. on ice, 1 min. vortexing).</p>c. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 18,000 rpm (39,000\u00d7g) for 10 minutes in a JA 20 rotor. Both insoluble (pellet) and soluble (supernatant) fractions were further analyzed.</p>d. The supernatant was diluted in sample buffer (\u00bc dilution), boiled 10 minutes and cooled to room temperature.</p>e. The pellet obtained in \u201cc\u201d was boiled during 10 minutes in sample buffer (5 ml) and cooled to room temperature. The mixture was centrifuged at 18,000 rmp (39,000\u00d7g) for 15 minutes in a JA 20 rotor. The supernatant was recovered and was diluted \u00bc in sample buffer.</p>f. Samples from the supernatant (obtained in \u201cd\u201d) and solubilized pellet (obtained in \u201ce\u201d) were loaded on a 12% PAGE. A band corresponding to SOD-p31 (between MW 68 and 43 Kd) was present in the insoluble fraction (samples of solubilized pellet).</p>Immunoreactivity of SOD-p31 band was tested by Western Analysis using serum Trimar 0036 from an AIDS patient. For this purpose, proteins were fractionated on a 12% PAGE as previously described and transferred to nitrocellulose filter paper. The filter paper was then treated with serum 0036, followed by a second goat anti-human antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Color was developed using an HRP substrate. Bands corresponding to p31-SOD were present in samples corresponding to the insoluble (Pellet) fractions. Bands of smaller size, present in both soluble and insoluble fractions, also react with the sera and most probably correspond to degradation products of SOD-p31.</p>4.3.3.3. Purification and Characterization</p>Frozen bacteria (Section 3.5) or yeast cells expressing the p31-SOD fusion protein are thawed at room temperature and suspended in 1.5 volumes of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, for bacteria; 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF for yeast), and mixed with 1 volume of acid-washed glass beads.</p>Cells are broken for 15 min in a non-continuous mode using the glass chamber of a Dynomill unit at 3,000 rpm, connected to a \u221220\u00b0 C. cooling unit. Glass beads are decanted for 2-3 min on ice, the cell lysate is removed. The decanted glass beads are washed twice with 30 ml of lysis buffer at 4\u00b0 C. The cell lysate is centrifuged at 39,000\u00d7g for 30 min.</p>The pellet obtained from the above centrifugation is washed once with lysis buffer, after vortexing and suspending it at 4\u00b0 C. (same centrifugation as above). The washed pellet is treated with 0.2% SDS (for bacteria) or 0.1% SDS (for yeast) in lysis buffer and agitated by rocking at 4\u00b0 C. for 10 min. The lysate is centrifuged at 39,000\u00d7g for 30 min. The pellet is boiled in sample buffer (67.5 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, 5% B-mercaptoethanol, 2.3% SDS) for 10 min and centrifuged for 10 min at 39,000\u00d7g. The supernatant is recovered and further centrifuged at 100,000\u00d7g for 60 min (60 Ti rotor). This step is replaced by a 0.45 \u03bcm filtration when yeast is used. The supernatant from the above centrifugation is loaded (maximum 50 mg of protein) on a gel filtration column (2.5\u00d790 cm, ACA 34 LKB) with a flow rate of 0.3-0.4 ml/min, equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 0.1% SDS. The fractions containing SOD-p31 are pooled and concentrated either by vacuum dialysis or using a YM5 Amicon membrane at 40 psi. The protein is stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. as concentrated solution.</p>Gel electrophoresis analysis shows that the SOD-p31 protein migrates having a molecular weight of about 46 kd and is over 90% pure.</p>4.4. Reverse Transcriptase (RT)</p>The AIDS retroviral reverse transcriptase (RT) is an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase found in virions in low quantities. RT is encoded within a domain of the viral pol gene. The mature enzyme is derived by proteolytic processing from a large polypeptide precursor whose cleavage is thought to be mediated by a viral protease.</p>The amino terminal sequence of HIV RT has been reported [Veronese et al. (1986) Science 231: 1289-1291] and corresponds to proline-156 of the polymerase gene (nucleotide 2403, FIG. 5). The carboxy terminal end of the RT gene is estimated to be at valine-691 (nucleotide 3708).</p>4.4.1. pAB24/RT4 Expression Vector</p>A 6.1 kb EcoRI fragment of cloned proviral DNA was cloned into pUC19 at the EcoRI site and designated pUC-ARV8A. Plasmid pUC-ARV8A was digested with BalI and KpnI which liberates a 1535 bp fragment containing coding sequence for amino acids proline-180 through tryptophane-690. This fragment was extended, using synthetic oligonucleotides, to include proline-164 at the N-terminus and alanine-693 at the C-terminus. The synthetic DNA also provides a methionine initiation codon.</p>The RT-encoding fragment was modified by the addition of synthetic oligonucleotide adapters. The 5\u2032 synthetic DNA has the following sequence:</p>5\u2032-CATGCCTATCTCTCCAATCGAAACCGTC\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20033\u2032-GGATAGAGAGGTTAGCTTTGGCAG \u2003\u2003\u2003CCAGTCAAGCTTAAACCAGGTATGGATGGG\u2003\u2003\u2003GGTCAGTTCGAATTTGGTCCATACCTACCC \u2003\u2003\u2003CCCAAGGTCAAGCAGTGG-3\u2032\u2003\u2003\u2003GGGTTCCAG",
    "as fractionated by stepwise NH<sub>4</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>precipitation. Greater than 90% of RT activity was in the 0-30% NH<sub>4</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>insoluble fraction. This NH<sub>4</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of reverse transcriptase buffer (RTB; 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM B-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20% vol/vol glycerol) containing 50 mM KCl. An Amicon pressure filtration device was used for desalting. The extract was then applied to a cellulose phosphate column (Sigma C-2383) (2.5 cm\u00d730 cm) preequilibrated in RTB containing 50 mM KCl. The column was washed with 100 ml of the same buffer. A linear gradient of 50 to 800 mM KCl in RTB was used for elution. Individual fractions were monitored for RT activity. The peak fractions of RT activity were between 150 and 225 mM KCl. This material (about 15 ml total) was pooled, desalted by Amicon filtration using RTB containing 50 mM KCl, and then applied to a single-stranded DNA cellulose column (Sigma D-8273) (1.0 cm\u00d710 cm) preequilibrated in RTB at 50 mM KCl. The column was washed with 30 ml of this buffer and eluted with a linear gradient of RTB from 50 to 800 mM KCl. Fractions were monitored for RT activity and peak fractions were pooled.</p>4.4.4. Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting</p>Recombinant RT was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting techniques using AIDS patients' sera. The recombinant protein gave an apparent gel mobility of approximately 66 kD, indicating an extremely close approximation to the native p66 species, and in good agreement with the calculated molecular weight of 62.5 kD. It was also noted that during purification, processing of this 66 KD protein occurred giving a second major species with an estimated molecular weight of 51\u00b11.5 KD. This processing is presumably due to a yeast protease since the region thought to encode ARV protease was not included: in this expression construction. Previously, HIV gag-pol fusions expressed in yeast were shown to be processed when this protease region was included. Kramer et al. (1986) Science 231: 1580-1584. That the p66 and p51 species produced in yeast had identical N-termini (Pro.Ile,Ser.Pro.Ile, etc.) was confirmed by gas phase sequence analysis of the purified proteins (15 cycles; as a mixture, Panel A, lane 3). Thus, yeast may mimic the natural maturation processes for HIV RTs, giving rise to both p66 and p51. The sequence analysis also showed that the N-termini methionine derived from the synthetic initiation codon was removed in vivo. Interestingly, the processing observed in yeast may indicate that HIV protease is not necessarily required for this processing event in vivo. Preliminary immunoblot analysis of recombinant RT also indicates a high degree of reactivity with AIDS sera. Of 20 sera tested, 19 scored positive.</p>4.4.5. RT Activity Assay</p>Analysis of recombinant RT activity by enzymatic assay was performed on crude yeast lysates and the purified enzyme. Cruse lysate was prepared as follows. Cells from 25 ml culture were pelleted by centrifugation at 2,500 rpm for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 7.5 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 14 mM B-mercaptoethanol, 1.2M sorbitol, and 200 \u03bcg/ml Zymolyase. Spheroplast formation, monitored by light mic",
    " of Goat anti-human IgG-HRP conjugate diluted in Conjugate Buffer [PBS pH 7.2, 0.3% Casein, 5% normal goat serum, 0.01% ANS, 0.01% Thimerosal] with agitation for 30 minutes at room temperature (15\u00b0-30\u00b0 C.).</p>The strips were removed from the conjugate solution and then washed three times with water. The strips were then incubated with 1 ml/strip of Developer Buffer [10 mM Sodium Phosphate, 20 mM Sodium Chloride, 0.8 \u03bcl/ml 30% hydrogen peroxide, 0.05% (w/v) 4-chloro-1-naphthol, 16.6% methanol] with agitation for 15 minutes at room temperature (15\u2032-30\u00b0 C.). The reaction was stopped by removing the strips from the Developer Buffer and washing two times in water. The color developed on the band is compared with positive control bands (IgG applied at 0.25 \u03bcg/ml and 1.25 \u03bcg/ml).</p>Yeast and bacterial proteins were used to preabsorb antisera for cross-reactive antibodies. Yeast extract was prepared by processing bulk yeast S. cerevisiae (Red Star Yeast, grade 1; Red Star, Oakland, Calif.) through the standard lysis procedure as described previously for the purification of yeast recombinant proteins. The insoluble cellular debris was separated from the soluble protein fraction. The E. coli extract was prepared by growing E. coli strain D1210 (pSODCF2), lysing the cells, and solubilizing the pellet as described in Section 3.6.4. YP45 extract is a yeast protein and was prepared by growing S. cerevisiae AB110 and following the purification procedure described in Section 4.3.3.3. A 45 kd yeast protein was purified which helps in preabsorbing nonspecific cross-reactive antibodies found in some area.</p>6. Serology Studies with Recombinant HIV Polypeptides</p>6.1 Immunoblot with Env Polypeptides</p>Recombinant polypeptides originating from different regions of the env gene of the ARV-2 isolate of HIV (Section 4.2) were used to characterize the anti-envelope antibody response of virus seropositive individuals. The sera characterized included specimens from AIDS patients, ARC patients and clinically healthy homosexual men with documented exposure to the virus through sexual contact with AIDS or ARC patients (contacts).</p>Regions of the envelope gene of the ARV-2 isolate of HIV were cloned into yeast expression vectors (env-1, env-2, env-3) or bacterial expression vectors (env-5b), and used to produce recombinant proteins as described in Sections 3 and 4.</p>Extracts of yeast for SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were prepared as follows: 1 ml of yeast grown to 20 O.D. (A450) were pelleted and suspended in 200 \u03bcl of electrophoresis sample buffer. The mixture was boiled for 10 min and then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 2 min to remove cell debris prior to electrophoresis. To prepare bacterial extracts for gel electrophoresis, bacterial cells from 1 ml of culture were pelleted, suspended in 200 \u03bcl of electrophoresis sample buffer, and disrupted by 3 cycles of freezing and thawing. The mixture was boiled for 10 minutes prior to electrophoresis.</p>Yeast or bacterial extracts were electrophoresed on standard Laemmli discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide (12% acrylamide) gels using a Biorad Laboratories minigel apparatus. Laemmli (1970) Nature 227: 680-685. The extracts (100 \u03bcl) were loaded into an 8 cm well in the stacking gel prior to electrophoresis. Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Towbin et al. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 76: 4350-4355. Strips of the filter with the electroblotted lysates were cut and each strip reacted with an individual serum sample diluted 1/100.</p>Sera from 85 seropositive individuals, including AIDS patients, ARC patients, contacts and clinically healthy individuals, as well as a pool of sera from normal human blood donors, were assayed on env-1, env-2 and env-3. The blots were processed with Carnation nonfat dry milk as described previously. Johnson et al. (1984) Gene Anal. Techn. 1: 3-8. The enzyme conjugate (diluted 1/200) was goat antiserum to human immunoglobulin G (Cappel Laboratories) and the chromogen was HRP color reagent (4-chloro-1-Napthol; Biorad Laboratories).</p>Positive immunoblot assays obtained with env-1, -2, and -3 are shown in FIG. 30. A prominent band at 28,000 was seen in the env-1 blot with a patient's serum with anti-env-1 antibodies. In the immunoblot of env-2, the antibody-positive serum reacted with a protein of approximately 55 kD. With env-3, the positive serum reacted with a series of bands migrating between 30,000 and 35,000. The multiple immunoreactive species in the env-3 immunoblot are due to differences in glycosylation (see Section 4.2.3) of this polypeptide during its synthesis in yeast. Five potential glycosylation sites are contained within the coding region for env-3.</p>The results of assays of the reactivity of sera obtained from the various patient groups in the 85 serum panel with the env-1, env-2 and env-3 are presented in table below:</p>ClinicalNumberNumber Reacting With:GroupTestedenv-1env-2env-3Contacts214 (19%)21 (100%)21 (100%)ARC263 (12%)26 (100%)26 (100%)AIDS386 (16%)36 (95%)\u200236 (95%)\u2002</p>All of the specimens selected for this analysis were positive in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for antibodies to the AIDS retrovirus. Weiss et al. (1985) J.A.M.A. 253: 221-225. Sera from all of the contacts and ARC patients had antibodies that reacted with env-2 and env-3 indicating that they had antibodies to both gp120 and gp41 that could be detected with these non-glycosylated polypeptides in immunoblot assays. Thirty-six of the 38 AIDS patients (95%) had antibodies that reacted with env-2. The same thirty-six sera also reacted with env-3. The two AIDS sera that did not react in immunoblot assays with env-2 or env-3 either lacked antibodies detected using these recombinant antigens, or their antibody titers were below the limit of detection in these assays, at least in gen"
