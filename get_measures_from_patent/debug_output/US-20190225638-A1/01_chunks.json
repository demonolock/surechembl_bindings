    "onstrated to be highly efficient inhibitors of galectin-3, with unprecedented IC<sub>50 </sub>values as low as 4.8 \u03bcM, which is a 20-fold improvement in comparison with the natural N-acetyllactosamine disaccharide (S\u00f6rme et al., 2002; S\u00f6rme et al., 2003b, 2005). These derivatives are less polar overall, due to the presence of the aromatic amido moieties and are thus more suitable as agents for the inhibition of galectins in vivo. Furthermore, C3-triazolyl galactosides have been demonstrated to be as potent inhibitors as the corresponding C3-amides of some galectins. Hence, any properly structured galactose C3-substituent may confer enhanced galectin affinity.</p>However, the C3-amido- and C3-triazolyl-derivatised compounds are still susceptible to hydrolytic degradation in vivo, due to the presence of a glycosidic bond in the galactose and N-acetyllactosamine saccharide moiety and, although they are potent small molecule inhibitors of galectin-3, even further improved affinity and stability is desirable. Accordingly, inhibitors based on 3,3\u2032-diamido- or 3,3\u2032-ditriazolyl-derivatization of thiodigalactoside have been developed, (Cumpstey et al., 2005b; Cumpstey et al., 2008; Salameh et al., 2010; WO/2005/113569 and US2007185041; WO/2005/113568, U.S. Pat. No. 7,638,623 B2; T. Delaine, 2016, ChemBioChem 10.1002/cbic.201600285) which lack O-glycosidic hydrolytically and enzymatically labile linkages. These inhibitors also displayed superior affinity for several galectins (down to Kd in the low nM range). Nevertheless, although displaying high affinity for galectins, the 3,3\u2032-derivatized thiodigalactosides still comprise a disadvantage in their multistep synthesis involving double inversion reaction to reach at 3-N-derivatized galactose building blocks. Furthermore, cyclohexane replacement of one galactose ring in thiodigalactoside has been evidenced to mimic the galactose ring and hence to provide galectin-1 and -3 inhibitors with efficiency approaching those of the diamido- and ditriazolyl-thiodigalactoside derivatives (WO/2010/126435). Replacement of a D-galactopyranose unit with a substituted cyclohexane decreases polarity and most likely also metabolic susceptibility, thus improving drug-like properties.</p>Some earlier described compounds have the following general formulas</p><img id=\"EMI-C00001\" path=\"US20190225638A1-20190725-C00001.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/514984469/US/20190725/A1/020190/22/56/38/US20190225638A1-20190725-C00001.TIF\"/></p>as described in WO/2005/113568,\n\nand\n</p><img id=\"EMI-C00002\" path=\"US20190225638A1-20190725-C00002.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/514984694/US/20190725/A1/020190/22/56/38/US20190225638A1-20190725-C00002.TIF\"/></p>as described in WO/2005/113569, in which R<sup>1 </sup>can be a D-galactose.</p>In recently published (T.
