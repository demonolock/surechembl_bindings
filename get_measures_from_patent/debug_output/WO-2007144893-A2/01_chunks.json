    "t invention provides antibodies having high specificity to fibroblast growth factors of more than one subtype. The present invention further provides antibodies having high affinity to fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) having cross-reactivity to other fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) useful in blocking both ligand-dependent and constitutive ligand-independent receptor activation. It is now disclosed that antibodies cross-reactive to FGFR2 and/or FGFR3 are useful in the prevention, attenuation or treatment of cell proliferative diseases of epithelial origin including but not limited to bladder cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory or mechanism of action, these antibodies may block receptor activation by blocking either FGF binding or heparin binding or both.</p>\n  In one aspect the present invention is related to molecules comprising at least the antigen-binding portion of an antibody having affinity for fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) optionally with cross-reactivity to other FGF receptors, which block both ligand-dependent and constitutive ligand-independent receptor activation. \n\n According to certain embodiments of the present invention, the antibody which blocks activation of fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) has high affinity to both FGFR2 and FGFR3. According to particular embodiments the antibody has affinity of at least 5OnM (KD &lt; 50 nM), to both FGFR2 and FGFR3. Preferably the antibody of the invention has an affinity of at least 1OnM to both FGFR2 and FGFR3. According to some embodiments the antibody is substantially devoid of affinity to FGFRl .</p>\n  According to some embodiments of the present invention, the antibody having affinity for FGFR2 with cross-reactivity to other FGF receptors is selected from a monoclonal antibody, and a fragment of a monoclonal antibody including but not limited to Fab, F(ab')<sub>2</sub> and single chain Fv (scFv). Additional embodiments include chimeric antibodies; human and humanized antibodies; recombinant and engineered antibodies, and fragments thereof. A preferred antibody species is a single chain antibody. Single chain antibodies can be single chain composite polypeptides having antigen binding capabilities and comprising amino acid sequences homologous or analogous to the variable regions of an immunoglobulin light and heavy chain i.e. linked VR-V<sub>L</sub> or single chain Fv (scFv).</p>\n  In one embodiment, the molecule comprising at least the antigen-binding portion of an antibody having affinity for FGFR2 with cross-reactivity to other FGF receptors, consists of a V<sub>H</sub>-CDR3 region and a V<sub>L</sub>-CDR3 region having SEQ ID NO: 1 and SEQ ID NO:2, respectively. In another embodiment the molecule comprising at least the antigen- binding portion of an antibody having affinity for FGFR2 with cross-reactivity to other FGF receptors, is a si"
