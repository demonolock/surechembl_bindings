    "membrane preparation with the [3H] -ligand, with or without addition of compounds of the invention, separation of bound of bound and free ligand was performed by filtration over glassfiber filters. Radioactivity on the filter was measured by liquid scintillation counting.</p>The cannabinoid CBI antagonistic activity of compounds of the invention was determined by functional studies using CHO cells in which human cannabinoid CBI receptors are stably expressed (see M. Rinaldi-Carmona et. al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 278 (1996) 871). The stable expression of the human cannabinoid receptor in cell systems was first described in Nature 1990, 346, 561-564 (CBI) and Nature 1993, 365, 61-65 (CB2) respectively. Adenylyl cyclase was stimulated using forskolin and measured by quantifying the amount of accumulated cyclic AMP. Concomitant activation of CB 1 receptors by CB 1 receptor agonists (e.g. CP-55,940 or (R)-WIN-55212-2) can attenuate the forskolin- induced accumulation of cAMP in a concentration dependent manner. This CBI receptor \n\nmediated response can be antagonised by CBI receptor antagonists such as the compounds of the invention.</p>The compounds of formula (I) show an excellent affinity for the CBI receptor, determined with the experimental conditions described in Devane etal. Mol. Pharmacol. 34 (1988) 605-613. The compounds of the present invention or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts or sovates are antagonist's and selective for the CBI receptor with affinites below IC50 = 2 \u03bcM. They exhibit at least a 10 fold selectivity against the CB2 receptor.</p></p>Effect of CBI receptor antagonist/inverse agonist on CP 55,940-induced Hypothermia in NMRI mice</p>Animals</p>Male NMRI mice were used in this study and were obtained from Research</p>Consulting Company Ltd (RCC) of F\u03cdllinsdorf (Switzerland). Mice, weighing 30-3 lg were used in this study. Ambient temperature is approximately 20-21\u00b0C and relative humidity</p>55-65%. A 12 hours light-dark cycle is maintained in the rooms with all tests being performed during the light phase. Access to tap water and food are ad libitum. \n\n Method</p>All measurements were made between 12:00 am and 5:00 pm. Mice were brought in this environment and habituated for at least two hours before the start of the experiment. They had always free access to food and water. For each dose, 8 mice were used. Rectal body temperature measurements were recorded by mean of a rectal probe (RET2 of Physitemp) and digital thermometer (Digi-sense n\u00b08528-20 of Cole Par er, Chicago USA). The probe was inserted about 3.5 cm in each mouse.</p>The body temperature was taken 15 min before administration of either Vehicle or CBI receptor antagonist/inverse agonist. 30 or 90 min after i.p. or p.o. administration of this compound, respectively, rectal body temperature was recorded in order to evaluate any influence of the compound itself. The CB receptor agonist CP 55,940 (0.3 mg/kg) was immediately administered intravenously, then 20 mi"
