    "g residue positions were then mapped onto the 3-D structure of BMP-7 <sup>31</sup>. Of the three structural regions identified <sup>31</sup> , peptides designed around the finger 2 loop proved to be the most promising. These are 16 residue long peptides of -20 kDa molecular weight that are \n\n cyclized via a disulfide bond between the first and 11 residue positions in order to stabilize a loop similar in conformation to the finger 2 loop of BMP7 (FIG. 45 A). </p> (C) Lead Optimization and characterization of THR-123 </p> Preliminary screening for optimization was based on anti-inflammatory efficacy in an in vitro cell-based assay using a human renal tubular epithelial cell line (HK-2). The assay tested the ability of compounds to reverse the increase in production of cytokine IL-6 that resulted from stimulation of the cells with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a. Sequence-activity analysis was carried out using the SVA program. After six optimization cycles, THR-123 (Fig 2 A) emerged as the lead compound, which was further evaluated in other relevant anti-fibrosis assays (vide infra). </p> First, specific affinity of the extra cellular domains (ECD) of the several type I receptors of BMPs to THR-123 was analyzed. Binding of cold BMP7 to immobilized </p> 125 </p>receptor ECDs was determined by competition with I-labeled BMP7 and analyzed by Scatchard analysis to determine effective dissociation constants of BMP7 for each of the receptor ECDs. To obtain an estimate of the effective dissociation constant of THR-123 for a particular receptor ECD, the dissociation constant for cold BMP7 was multiplied by the ratio of the ED50 of THR-123 to the ED50 for cold BMP7. The data demonstrated that THR-123 competes with BMP7 for Alk-3 (FIG. 45 B) and to a small extent with Alk-2 (data not shown), whereas absolutely no competition was observed on Alk-6 (FIG. 45 C), suggesting that of the three known BMP type I receptors Alk-3 is the predominant target for THR-123. </p> The stability of THR-123 in whole blood and plasma was tested in vitro. In PBS- mannitol buffer, THR-123 was stable for over 400 minutes (FIG. 46). In rat plasma, THR-123 is slowly degraded with a half-life of 358 minutes (FIG. 46), while in whole blood, THR-123 degraded rapidly (half-life of 70 minutes) (FIG. 46). </p> The persistence of THR-123 in systemic circulation was evaluated using iv- administered <sup>125</sup>I-labeled compound and following the radioactivity decay. In both plasma and whole blood, THR-123 levels immediately decreased within 5 minutes (by almost 90%), suggesting a very short half-life of THR-123 in the alpha-phase (FIG. 45</p>D) . Beta-phase assessment of <sup>125</sup>I-THR-123 indicates a half-life of 55-58 min (FIG. 45 </p> 125 </p> E) . Six hours after intravenous administration of I-THR-123, the majority of the radioactivity was still localized in the kidney and bladder (FIG. 45 F), suggesting that \n\n THR-123 accumulates in the kidney and is excreted via the bladder into the urine. Orally administrated <sup>125</sup>I-labeled THR-123 lo",
