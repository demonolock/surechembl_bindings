    "s is a variation used to determine the improved survival afforded by compound treatment.</p>\n  [00152] Multiple outcome measures are used for this evaluation. One of these is the measurement of levels of the liver enzyme ALT in the blood. Elevated ALT levels are routinely observed in the blood of patients suffering from a variety of liver diseases. ALT measurement is a very common and relevant clinical laboratory test for the extent of liver disease in patients. A second measure involves gross and histological evaluation of liver damage. The extent of liver damage can be graded by examining liver samples prepared and evaluated microscopically by trained observers. In certain embodiment, the liver injury can be sufficiently severe as to cause mortality. In certain embodiment, compounds described herein protect against TNF- \u03b1 / D-GaI induced liver injury as determined by these parameters. In certain embodiment, compounds described herein protect against Fas induced liver injury as determined by these parameters.</p>\n  [00153] In certain embodiments, the compounds provided herein show reduction in liver injury and hepatic fibrosis in the bile duct ligation model.</p>\n  [00154] Other models of liver injury include the LPS / D-GaI model, the \u03b1-Fas induced liver injury model and the Con A model of liver injury. These models are also relevant to human disease. All three models are complementary to one another.</p>\n  [00155] In certain embodiments, the compounds provided herein show inhibition of HCV replication in HCV replicon assay.</p>\n  6. COMBINATION THERAPY</p>\n  [00156] In certain embodiments, the MMP inhibitors and caspase inhibitors provided herein are administered in combination with one or more third agents known to treat a liver disease. The dosages of the third agents are to be used in the combination therapies are known in the art. In certain embodiments, dosages lower than those which have been or are currently being used to prevent or treat liver disease, such as hepatitis B or C, are used in the combination therapies provided herein. The recommended dosages of agents can obtained from the knowledge of those of skill. For those agents that are approved for clinical use, recommended dosages are described in, for example, Schiff s Diseases of the Liver 10th edition \n\n (2006), Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins, Hardman et al, eds., 1996, Goodman &amp; Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis Of Basis Of Therapeutics 9<sup>th</sup> Ed, Mc-Graw-Hill, New York; Physician's Desk Reference (PDR) 57<sup>th</sup> Ed., 2003, Medical Economics Co., Inc., Montvale, NJ, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. The dosages given will depend on absorption, inactivation and excretion rates of the drug as well as other factors known to those of skill in the art. It is to be noted that dosage values will also vary with the severity of the condition to be alleviated. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dos",
