    "g affinity of the IL- 15/IL-l 5Ra complex to the \u03b2\u03b3 receptor complex expressed on the surface of cells. Cells that endogenously or recombinantly express the \u03b2\u03b3 receptor complex can be used in this assay. The cells are contacted with the IL-15/IL-15Ra complex in the presence or absence of the Antagonistic Therapeutic Agent antibody. The IL-15/IL-15Ra complex is labeled with a fluorophore, radioisotope, or other detection markers, and the level of binding of the labeled IL-15/IL-l 5Ra complex to the \u03b2\u03b3 receptor complex expressed the cell surface of cells are assayed in the presence and absence of the antibody using methods known in the art, e g , flow cytometry fluorescent markers, or other compatible machines to detect the detectin marker. In a specific embodiment, the Antagonistic Therapeutic Agent antibody reduces the amount of labeled IL-15/IL-l 5Ra complexes that bind to the \u03b2\u03b3 receptor complex on the cell surface. \n\n 5.5.1.2. Ia vitro Assays</p>[00295] The identification of antibodies that immunospecifically bind to the IL- 1 SIXL- 15Ra complex can be assessed using any method well known in the art, e.g., ELISA, coimmunoprecipitation, Biacore assays, and KinEx A assays.</p>[00296] Binding assays can be used to determine the binding affinity of an antibody to IL- 15/IL-l 5Ra complexes. Binding assays may be performed either as direct binding assays or as competition-binding assays. Binding can be detected using standard ELISA or standard Flow Cytometry assays. In a direct binding assay, a candidate antibody is tested for binding to the IL-15/IL-l 5Ra complex.</p>[00297] Competition-binding assays, on the other hand, assess the ability of a candidate antibody to compete with a known antibodies or other compound that binds IL- 15/IL- 15Ra complexes.</p>[00298] In a direct binding assay, the IL- 15/IL- 15Ra complex is contacted with a candidate antibody under conditions that allow binding of the candidate antibody to the IL- 15/IL-l 5Ra complexes. The binding may take place in solution or on a solid surface. Preferably, the candidate antibody is previously labeled for detection. Any detectable compound may be used for labeling, such as but not limited to, a luminescent, fluorescent, or radioactive isotope or group containing same, or a nonisotopic label, such as an enzyme or dye. After a period of incubation sufficient for binding to take place, the reaction is exposed to conditions and manipulations that remove excess or non-specifically bound antibody. Typically, it involves washing with an appropriate buffer. Finally, the presence of a IL- 15/EL-15Ra-antibody complex is detected.</p>[00299] In a competition-binding assay, a candidate antibody is evaluated for its ability to inhibit or displace the binding of a known anti-IL-15/IL-l 5Ra complex antibody (or other compound) to the IL-15/IL-l 5Ra complex. A labeled known binder of IL-15/IL-l 5Ra complex may be mixed with the candidate antibody, and placed under conditions in which the interaction between them would normally occur, with and without the addition of the candidate antibody. The amount of labeled known binder of IL- 15/IL- 15Ra complex that binds the IL- 15/IL-l 5Ra complex may be compared to the amount bound in the presence or absence of the candidate antibody. [00300] In one embodiment, the binding assay is carried out with one or more components immobilized on a solid surface to facilitate antibody antigen complex formation and detection. In various embodiments, the solid support could be, but is not restricted to, \n\n polycarbonate, polystyrene, polypropylene, polyethylene, glass, nitrocellulose, dextran, nylon, polyacrylamide and agarose. The support configuration can include beads, membranes, microparticles, the interior surface of a reaction vessel such as a microtiter plate, test tube or other reaction vessel. The immobilization of IL- 15/IL- 15Ra complex, or other component, can be achieved through covalent or non-covalent attachments. In one embodiment, the attachment may be indirect, i.e. , through an attached antibody. In another embodiment, the IL-15/IL-l5Ra complex and negative controls are tagged with an epitope, such as glutathione S-transferase (GST) so that the attachment to the solid surface can be mediated by a commercially available antibody such as anti-GST (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).</p>[00301] For example, such an affinity binding assay may be performed using the IL-15/IL- 15Ra complex which is immobilized to a solid support. Typically, the non-mobilized component of the binding reaction, in this case the candidate anti-IL-l5/IL-15Ra complex antibody, is labeled to enable detection. A variety of labeling methods are available and may be used, such as luminescent, chromophore, fluorescent, or radioactive isotope or group containing same, and nonisotopic labels, such as enzymes or dyes. In one embodiment, the candidate antibody is labeled with a fluorophore such as fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC, available from Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis). Such an affinity binding assay may be performed using the IL-15/IL-15Ra complex antigen immobilized on a solid surface. Antibodies are then incubated with the antigen and the specific binding of antibodies is detected by methods known in the art including, but not limited to, BiaCore Analyses, ELISA, FMET and RIA methods.</p>[00302] Finally, the label remaining on the solid surface may be detected by any detection method known in the art. For example, if the candidate antibody is labeled with a fluorophore, a fluorimeter may be used to detect complexes.</p>[00303] In one embodiment, the antibody is added to binding assays in the form of intact cells that express IL-15/IL-15Ra complex antigen, or isolated membranes containing IL- 15/IL- 15Ra complex. Thus, direct binding to IL- 15/IL- 15Ra complex antigen may be assayed in intact cells in culture or in animal models in the presence and absence of the candidate antibody. A labeled candidate antibody may be mixed with cells that express human IL- 15/IL-l 5Ra complex, or with crude extracts obtained from such cells, and the candidate antibody may be added. Isolated membranes may be used to identify candidate antibodies that interact with IL-15/IL-l 5Ra complex. For example, in a typical experiment using isolated membranes, cells may be genetically engineered to express IL-15/IL-l 5Ra \n\n complex antigen. Membranes can be harvested by standard techniques and used in an in vitro binding assay. Labeled candidate antibody (e.g., fluorescent labeled antibody) is bound to the membranes and assayed for specific activity; specific binding is determined by comparison with binding assays performed in the presence of excess unlabeled (cold) candidate antibody. Alternatively, soluble IL-15/IL-15Ra complex may be recombinantly expressed and utilized in non-cell based assays to identify antibodies that bind to the IL- 15/IL-15Ra complex. The recombinantly expressed IL-15/IL-15Ra polypeptides can be used in the non-cell based screening assays.</p>[00304] Alternatively, the binding reaction may be carried out in solution. In this assay, the labeled component is allowed to interact with its binding partner(s) in solution. If the size differences between the labeled component and its binding partner(s) permit such a separation, the separation can be achieved by passing the products of the binding reaction through an ultrafilter whose pores allow passage of unbound labeled component but not of its binding partners) or of labeled component bound to its partners). Separation can also be achieved using any reagent capable of capturing a binding partner of the labeled component from solution, such as an antibody against the binding partner and so on. [00305] In another specific embodiment, the solid support is membrane containing IL- 15/IL-l 5Ra complex attached to a microtiter dish. Candidate antibodies, for example, can bind cells that express library antibodies cultiv",
    "0] The toxicity and/or efficacy of the prophylactic and/or therapeutic protocols described herein can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD5O/ED5O. Therapies that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. While therapies that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such agents to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects. [00331] The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage of the prophylactic and/or therapeutic agents for use in humans. The dosage of such agents lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any therapy used in the method, e.g. , as described herein, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the Therapeutic Agent that achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.</p>[00332] In yet another embodiment, apoptotic cells are measured in both the attached and \"floating\" compartments of the cultures. Both compartments are collected by removing the supernatant, trypsinizing the attached cells, and combining both preparations following a centrifugation wash step (10 minutes, 2000 rpm).</p>[00333] In yet another embodiment, apoptosis is quantitated by measuring DNA fragmentation. Commercial photometric methods for the quantitative in vitro determination \n\n of DNA fragmentation are available. Examples of such assays, including TUNEL (which detects incorporation of labeled nucleotides in fragmented DNA) and ELISA-based assays, are described in Biochemica, 1999, no. 2, pp. 3437 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). [00334] In yet another embodiment, apoptosis can be observed morphologically. [00335] Cell lines on which such assays can be performed are well known to those of skill in the art. Apoptosis, necrosis and proliferation assays can also be performed on primary cells, e.g., a tissue explant.</p>6.
