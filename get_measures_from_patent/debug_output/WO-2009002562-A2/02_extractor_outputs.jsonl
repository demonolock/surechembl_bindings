{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that contain all four required components: a specific molecule name, a bioactivity metric (IC50, Ki, Kd, EC50), a specific numeric value for that metric, and a unit for that value. The text primarily describes methods and techniques for assays and binding studies, but does not provide specific data or results that meet the criteria."}
{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nThe dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD5O/ED5O.\nA dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the Therapeutic Agent that achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture."}
