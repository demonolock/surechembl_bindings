    "einserted into the incubator. Blank reference samples were also collected from pure PBS vials incubated at 37 \u00b1 0.1 \u2103.</p>The HPLC vials were tested in an HPLC machine (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) to determine the amount of insulin dissolved at a given time, with modifications to run time, using methods retrieved from the following paper. Briefly, 7.8X 300mm was used<sup>2</sup>And an insulin HMWP column (Waters Corp, Milford, USA) and set to room temperature. Elution was performed for 26 minutes at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min using a mobile phase made of 15% acetic acid (v/v), 20% acetonitrile (v/v) and 0.65g/L L-arginine all purchased from (Sigma-Aldrich).</p>Insulin stability test</p>The insulin micropillar tips were placed in a dry pill container and left in a climate controlled room set at 40 \u2103 and 75% relative humidity. The same batch of microcolumn tips was placed in a climate controlled chamber at 5 \u2103 and 15% relative humidity. In addition, a liquid formulation of pure insulin dissolved in PBS at a concentration of 4mg/mL was also placed in both climatic chambers. The samples were left for 0, 2, 4 and 16 weeks. Once removed, the microcolumn was subjected to a lysis test in addition to High Molecular Weight Protein (HMWP) analysis, activity test and raman spectroscopy. Raman analysis is described in the later section entitled \"raman spectroscopy\" along with HMWP analysis using the HPLC method described in the section \"in vitro lysis\" and activity testing using a receptor binding assay. Briefly, Scintillation Proximity Assays (SPA) were performed on human insulin from mini-columns and receptor binding affinity was verified by competition of human insulin from mini-columns with [125I ] TyrA 14-labeled insulin in SPA. The affinity was analyzed using a four parameter logistic model and the results were compared to untreated human insulin.</p>Raman spectroscopy</p>The compressed mixture of insulin and PEO was imaged using a DXRxi EM-CCD Raman imaging microscope (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). The sample was exposed to a 780nm wavelength laser at a power of 24mW and a frequency of 200 Hz. The laser beam was focused through a 20x NA 0.40 objective lens and the scatter was collected through the objective lens. Rayleigh and anti-Stokes scattering is blocked by an edge filter before entering a spectrometer equipped with a 400-line/mm grating. Scanning 200 x 200 \u03bcm in 5 \u03bcm each size of scanning step<sup>2</sup>The area of (a). Each portion was scanned 300 times. To smooth the data, a major component analysis was performed to eliminate spectra with high noise, and a root mean square analysis was performed to further filter the data. Peak position and width of the peak of interest were determined using a peak finding tool (peak finding tool) of MATLAB. Only insulin peaks that did not overlap with the PEO peaks were analyzed and the results are detailed in fig. 78.</p>Enzyme Activity assay</p>The microcolumn tips were manufactured as described abo"
