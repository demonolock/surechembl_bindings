    "t trimeric protein, such as another member of the TNF family, may be screened by, inter alia, the following methods: random screening of libraries of chemical compounds that bind to the target protein; or by obtaining structural information of a complex of the target protein, preferably with an agent that is known to bind specifically to that protein, by X-ray crystallography and subsequent use of computational means to rationally design and ultimately make synthetic compounds. These compounds, however, may or may not bind with high affinity to their target protein (s). The most desired of these compounds as candidates for human therapeutic agents would be those which bind with high affinity to their target protein (s) .</p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides methods for designing and making novel CD40:CD154 binding \n\ninterruptor compounds. This invention also provides an assay to detect whether an agent that specifically binds CD154 promotes lattice or aggregate formation of CD154 trimers on a cell surface or in solution. This assay may be used as a method to screen for novel CD40:CD154 binding interruptor compounds that specifically bind CD154 and interrupt its interaction with CD40.</p>This invention further relates to methods for improving the binding affinity or ability to block CD40:CD154 interaction of a synthetic molecule for a trimeric protein, wherein the synthetic molecule specifically binds to the trimeric protein but with low affinity (with a Kd in the micromolar range or higher) , is a poor blocker of CD40/CD154 interaction, or both. Such methods result in converting a synthetic molecule which does not significantly promote lattice or aggregate formation of trimers of CD154 on a cell surface or in solution to one that does. Lattice or aggregate formation enhances the potency of a molecule by the large-scale cooperativity of the binding event. The lattice or aggregate can also have the effect of making potential binding sites of the protein for its receptor inaccessible by sequestering the protein in a large complex. This sequestration results even if the molecule does not bind at a site on the protein that directly blocks its interaction with its receptor.</p>This invention further relates to compositions comprising the novel CD40:CD154 binding interruptor compounds. The invention further relates to methods of using these novel compounds to treat a subject with, inter alia, one or more conditions associated with inappropriate CD154 activation. This invention further relates to methods using these novel \n\ncompounds to treat a subject having one or more conditions associated with expression of a trimeric protein other than CD154.</p>This invention also relates to a two- dimensional lattice or aggregate comprising a plurality of trimeric CD154 molecules on a cell surface or in solution, wherein the lattice or aggregate is formed by anti-CD154 antibodies cross-linking the trimeric CD154 molecules .

The family members include, inter alia, TNF-of, TNF-\u03b2 (also known as lymphotoxin oi or \"LT\u03b1\"), lymphotoxin \u03b2 (\"LT\u03b2\"), Fas ligand, CD30L, CD27L and 4-1BBL. Members of this family are critically involved in the regulation of inflammation, immune response and tissue homeostasis. See, e.g..</p>Smith et al. Cell 76: 959-962 (1994) and Vassalli Ann. Rev. Immunolol . 10: 411-452 (1992), the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Most if not all of the proteins of this family form trimers. The pharmaceutical importance of members of the TNF family is underscored by FDA approval and the commercial sale of two drugs, REMICADE\u2122 and EMBREL<sup>R</sup>, which target the TNF pathway. \n\n An agent, such as a synthetic compound, that binds a trimeric protein, such as a TNF family protein, may bind with low affinity (with a Kd in the micromolar range or higher) . In one embodiment of this invention, the binding affinity of this agent for that trimeric protein may be improved by designing and making an improved version of the agent by converting it from one that does not cross-link trimers of that protein into one that does. Lattice or aggregate formation enhances the potency of a molecule by the large-scale cooperativity of the binding event. The lattice or aggregate can also have the effect of making potential binding sites of the protein for its receptor inaccessible by sequestering the protein in a large complex. This sequestration results even if the molecule does not bind at a site on the protein that directly blocks its interaction with its receptor. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the trimeric protein is a TNF family protein. In a more preferred embodiment, the TNF family protein is CD154.</p>Synthetic Compounds</p>Synthetic compounds (molecules) that bind to CD154 or another trimeric protein, such as another TNF family member, may be obtained by, inter alia, the following screening methods: randomly screening libraries of chemical compounds that bind to a particular protein; or by obtaining structural information of a complex of the protein and an agent that is known to bind specifically to that protein by X-ray crystallography and subsequent use of computational means to rationally design and ultimately make synthetic compounds. Some of the synthetic compounds may bind thei",
    " cell surface CD154 molecules; and (d) detecting that a lattice or aggregate of cross-linked CD154 molecules has formed on the cell surface.</p>In another preferred embodiment, a method is provided for screening a candidate compound for the property of specifically binding to CD154 and interrupting CD40:CD154 interaction, said method comprising the steps of:</p>(a) providing a solution comprising trimeric CD154 molecules;</p>(b) incubating said solution with said candidate compound, under conditions sufficient for said compound to promote cross-linking of said trimeric CD154 molecules in solution if said compound has the property of promoting such cross-linking; so as to produce a lattice or aggregate of CD154 molecules in solution; and</p>(c) detecting that a lattice or aggregate of cross-linked CD154 molecules has formed in solution. \n\n An assay is provided by this invention for screening a candidate compound for the property of specifically binding CD154 and interrupting CD40:CD154 interaction. The candidate compound is either an anti- CD154 antibody or a synthetic compound defined herein. One assay detects the promotion of lattice or aggregate formation of cell-surface CD154 trimers by an agent (that agent may be an antibody or a synthetic compound defined herein) that specifically binds CD154. Any assay that can detect lattice or aggregate formation of cell-surface CD154 trimers by an agent that specifically binds CD154 may be used. An example of such an assay is a cell-binding assay.</p>As shown in Example 1, as detected in a cell binding assay, monoclonal antibody (\"mAb\") 5c8, which specifically binds human CD154, promotes capping (lattice or aggregate formation) of a plurality of trimeric human CD154 on a cell surface by cross-linking CD154 trimers. In a cell binding assay, a detectable agent that specifically binds to cell surface CD154 molecules is added to CD154 molecules on a cell surface and formation of a lattice or aggregate of cross-linked CD154 molecules on the cell surface is detected by microscopy. An example of a detectable agent is an anti-CD154 antibody or a synthetic compound directly conjugated with a fluorochrome, which fluoresces under a certain wave-length. Another example of a detectable agent requires a first reagent, which is an anti-CD154 antibody or a synthetic compound that specifically binds CD154, and a secondary reagent, such as a secondary antibody (e.g. a goat anti-mouse IgG Fab fragment as shown in Example 1) , protein A, protein G or strepavidin (provided that the anti-CD154 antibody \n\nor synthetic compound is biotinylated) . The secondary reagent is conjugated with a fluorochrome and binds to the anti-CDl54 antibody or the synthetic compound that specifically binds CD154. The cell can be any cell that expresses CD154 or can be made to express CD154 on its cell surface (for example, by transfecting into a cell a vector comprising a CD154 gene under the control of a suitable promoter/enhancer) . In a preferred embodiment, the cell is a mammalian cell. The cell can be a T lymphocyte or an immortalized T cell. The immortalized T cell can be a Dl.l cell derived from ATCC Accession No. CRL 10915 (deposited on November 14, 1991) .</p>In an alternative embodiment, another assay is provided by this inventio",
    " Example 5, soluble human CD154 and mAb 5c8 or humanized 5c8 mAb are mixed together and allowed to bind. The mixture is then subjected to light scatter analysis on a detector, such as the Precision Detector PDLS 2000 instrument .</p>If an antibody or a synthetic compound is shown to promote lattice or aggregate formation by any of the above-identified assays, it is preferable to confirm that the antibody or synthetic compound does indeed interrupt CD40:CD154 interaction, as the property of an agent capable of promoting lattice or aggregate formation of CD154 trimers on a cell surface is correlated with that agent's ability to interrupt CD40:CD154 interaction. This confirmatory step can be performed by any assay that detects CD40:CD154 interaction.</p>A person skilled in the art is aware of conventional assays to assess whether the compounds designed according to this invention bind specifically to CD154 and whether such compounds interrupt CD40:CD154 interaction. Some of these assays detect whether, or the extent to which, B cells are activated by activated T cells via the interaction between CD154 \n\nand CD40. For example, monitoring of CD23 levels on B cells, or secretion of immunoglobulins by B cells is indicative of activation of B cells by activated T cells via the interaction between CD40 and CD154. Accordingly, these assays are, for example, in vitro assays for T cell activation of B cells; in vitro assays for immunoglobulin production by B cells and in vivo assays for inhibition of a humoral immune response. See, e.g., United States patent 5,474,771. Accordingly, examples of such assays include: an in vitro assay for T cell activation of B cells, an in vitro assay for immunoglobulin production by B cells and an in vivo assay for inhibition of a humoral immune response.</p>Lattice or Aggregate</p>In a preferred embodiment, this invention provides a multi-molecular, two-dimensional lattice or aggregate comprising:</p>(a) a plurality of trimeric CD154 molecules disposed on the extracellular surface of a cell membrane (preferably a mammalian cell membrane) or in solution; and</p>(b) anti-CD154 monoclonal antibody molecules, or antigen-binding fragments thereof, each cross-linking said plurality of trimeric</p>CD154 molecules such that a lattice or aggregate is formed on the extra-cellular surface of said cell membrane or in solution. The cell membrane can be of any cell that expresses CD154 or can be made to express CD154 on its cell surface (for example, by transfecting into a cell a vector comprising a CD154 gene under the control of a suitable promoter/enhancer) . In a preferred \n\nembodiment, the cell is a mammalian cell. The cell can be a T lymphocyte or an immortalized T cell. The immortalized T cell can be a Dl.l cell derived from ATCC Accession No. CRL 10915, described in, for example, US patent 5,474,771 (deposited on November 14, 1991) .</p>Lattice or aggregate formation enhances the potency of a molecule by the large-scale cooperativity of the binding event. The lattice or aggregate can also have the effect of making potential binding sites of the protein (such as CD154) for its receptor (such as CD40) inaccessible by sequestering the protein in a large complex. This sequestration results even ",
    "ntion may be administered in a pharmaceutically effective, prophylactically effective or therapeutically effective amount, which is an amount sufficient to produce a detectable, preferably medically beneficial effect on a subject at risk or afflicted with a condition associated with inappropriate CD154 activation. Medically beneficial effects include preventing, inhibiting, reversing or attenuating deterioration of, or detectably improving, the subject's medical condition.</p>Synthetic Compounds with Improved Affinity for Trimeric Proteins Other Than CD154</p>Synthetic compounds designed by the methods of this invention with improved affinity for trimeric proteins other than CD154, such as TNF family proteins other than CD154, may be used to treat conditions which respond to such proteins. The subjects, route of administration, dosage and frequency of treatment and formulation for these compounds will depend on the particular protein target to which a particular synthetic compound binds. The skilled artisan would appreciate these nuances and would be able to use these \n\ncompounds to treat the right subjects by the correct route of administration, dosage and frequency of treatment and formulation without undue experimentation.</p>Examples</p>The following are examples that illustrate the methods, compounds and compositions of this invention. These examples should not be construed as limiting: the examples are included for the purposes of illustration only.</p>EXAMPLE 1 A CELL-BINDING ASSAY: CONFOCAL</p>MICROSCOPY LATTICE OR AGGREGATE FORMATION ASSAY SHOWING STAINING PATTERN OF MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES 5C8 AND TRAP-1 ON Dl.l CELLS</p>MAb 5c8 or TRAP-1, each of which is a murine anti-human CD154 antibody, was bound to Dl.l Jurkat cells at 1 \u03bcg/ml for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C in RPMI (media) with 10% FBS to allow for rearrangement of CD154. Cells were fixed in ice-cold 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes to cross-link cell surface proteins and prevent further rearrangement. Cells were incubated on ice with a goat anti-mouse IgG Fab fragment conjugated with the fluorochrome Cy5 for 30 minutes in FACs (PBS with 1% BSA and 0.1% sodium azide) buffer with 2% goat serum to detect CD154-bound mAb 5c8 or mAb TRAP-1. The cells were then incubated with the fluorochrome Syto 13 to counterstain the DNA and RNA. Slides of the cells were viewed using a confocal microscope. This method can directly detect the anti-</p>CD154 antibody bound to 'human CD154 on the cell surface. This method can be applied to all murine \n\nantibodies and can easily be used for other antibodies, for example, human or humanized antibodies, by for example, using a human specific secondary antibody. As shown in Figure 1, mAb 5c8 staining was polarized into a cap-like structure on the cell surface, indicating that CD154 had been rearranged into a lattice or aggregate. MAb TRAP-1 staining was evenly dispersed over the entire cell surface, indicating no large-scale CD154 rearrangement as observed for mAb 5c8"
