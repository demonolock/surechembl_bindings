Non-covalent binding refers to a direct association between two molecules due to, for example, electrostatic, hydrophobic, ionic, and/or hydrogen-bond interactions, including interactions such as salt bridges and water bridges. Non-covalent binding interactions are generally characterized by a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of less than 10<sup>\u22126 </sup>M, less than 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, less than 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, less than 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>M, less than 10<sup>\u221210 </sup>M, less than 10<sup>\u221211 </sup>M, or less than 10<sup>\u221212 </sup>M. \u201cAffinity\u201d refers to the strength of non-covalent binding, increased binding affinity being correlated with a lower K<sub>D</sub>. \u201cSpecific binding\u201d generally refers to, e.g., binding between a ligand molecule and its binding site or \u201creceptor\u201d with an affinity of at least about 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>M or greater (e.g., less than 5\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, less than 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, less than 5\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, less than 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>M, less than 10<sup>\u221210 </sup>M, less than 10<sup>\u221211 </sup>M, or less than 10<sup>\u221212 </sup>M and greater affinity, or in a range from 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>to 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>or from 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>to 10<sup>\u221212</sup>). \u201cNon-specific binding\u201d generally refers to the binding of a ligand to something other than its designated binding site or \u201creceptor,\u201d typically with an affinity of less than about 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>M (e.g., binding with an affinity of less than about 10<sup>\u22126 </sup>M, less than about 10<sup>\u22125 </sup>M, less than about 10<sup>\u22124 </sup>M).

    " the immobilized anti-Fc antibodies which will bind to and immobilize it. A Co-MOD is applied, at several different concentrations, to the immobilized T-Cell-MMP (or its immobilized epitope conjugate), and the instrument's response recorded. Assays are conducted in a liquid medium comprising 25 mM HEPES pH 6.8, 5% poly(ethylene glycol) 6000, 50 mM KCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.02% Tween 20 nonionic detergent. Binding of the Co-MOD to the immobilized T-Cell-MMP (or its epitope conjugate) is conducted at 30\u00b0 C. As a positive control for binding affinity, an anti-MHC Class I monoclonal antibody can be used. For example, anti-HLA Class I monoclonal antibody (mAb) W6/32 (American Type Culture Collection No. HB-95; Parham et al. (1979) J. Immunol. 123:342), which has a K<sub>D </sub>of 7 nM, can be used. A standard curve can be generated using serial dilutions of the anti-MHC Class I monoclonal antibody. The Co-MOD, or the anti-MHC Class I mAb, is the \u201canalyte.\u201d BLI analyzes the interference pattern of white light reflected from two surfaces: i) from the immobilized polypeptide (\u201ctarget\u201d); and ii) from an internal reference layer. A change in the number of molecules (\u201canalyte\u201d; e.g., Co-MOD; anti-HLA antibody) bound to the biosensor tip causes a shift in the interference pattern; this shift in interference pattern can be measured in real time. The two kinetic terms that describe the affinity of the target/analyte interaction are the association constant (k<sub>a</sub>) and dissociation constant (k<sub>d</sub>). The ratio of these two terms (k<sub>d</sub>/k<sub>a</sub>) gives rise to the affinity constant K<sub>D</sub>. The assay can also be conducted with purified wild-type or its variant MOD immobilized on the biosensor while the Co-MOD is applied, at several different concentrations, to determine the binding parameters between a MOD and its Co-MOD.</p>Determining the binding affinity of a Co-MOD (e.g., IL-2R) with both a wild-type MOD (e.g., IL-2) and a variant MOD (e.g., an IL-2 variant as disclosed herein), or with a T-Cell-MMP (or its epitope conjugate) containing wild-type or variant MODs, thus allows one to determine the relative binding affinity of the wild-type and variant molecules. That is, one can determine whether the binding affinity of a variant MOD for its receptor (its Co-MOD) is reduced as compared to the binding affinity of the wild-type MOD for the same Co-MOD, and, if so, what is the percentage reduction from the binding affinity of the wild-type Co-MOD.</p>The BLI assay is carried out in a multi-well plate. To run the assay, the plate layout is defined, the assay steps are defined, and biosensors are assigned in Octet Data Acquisition software. The biosensor assembly is hydrated. The hydrated biosensor assembly and the assay plate are equilibrated for 10 minutes on the Octet instrument. Once the data are acquired, the acquired data are loaded into the Octet Data Analysis software. The data are processed in the Processing w",

The epitope tag can be, e.g., a FLAG tag, a hemagglutinin tag, a c-myc tag, a poly(histidine) tag, etc. The MFI measured over a range of concentrations of the T-Cell-MMP-epitope conjugate (library member) provides a measure of the affinity. The MFI measured over a range of concentrations of the T-Cell-MMP-epitope conjugate (library member) provides a half maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) of the T-Cell-MMP-epitope conjugate. In some cases, the EC<sub>50 </sub>of a T-Cell-MMP-epitope conjugate of the present disclosure for a target T-cell is in the nM range; and the EC<sub>50 </sub>of the T-Cell-MMP-epitope conjugate for a control T-cell (where a control T-cell expresses on its surface: i) a Co-MOD that binds the parental wild-type MOD; and ii) a T-cell receptor that does not bind to the epitope present in the T-Cell-MMP-epitope conjugate) is in the M range. In some cases, the ratio of the EC<sub>50 </sub>of a T-Cell-MMP-epitope conjugate of the present disclosure for a control T-cell to the EC<sub>50 </sub>of the T-Cell-MMP-epitope conjugate for a target T-cell is at least 1.5:1, at least 2:1, at least 5:1, at least 10:1, at least 15:1, at least 20:1, at least 25:1, at least 50:1, at least 100:1, at least 500:1, at least 10<sup>2</sup>:1, at least 5\u00d710<sup>2</sup>:1, at least 10<sup>3</sup>:1, at least 5\u00d710<sup>3</sup>:1, at least 10<sup>4</sup>:1, at lease 10<sup>5</sup>:1, or at least 10<sup>6</sup>:1. The ratio of the EC<sub>50 </sub>of a T-Cell-MMP-epitope conjugate of the present disclosure for a control T-cell to the EC<sub>50 </sub>of the T-Cell-MMP-epitope conjugate for a target T-cell is an expression of the selectivity of the T-Cell-MMP-epitope conjugate.</p>In some cases, when measured as described in the preceding paragraph, a T-Cell-MMP-epitope conjugate of the present disclosure exhibits sele",

Epitopes</p>The chemical conjugation sites and chemistries described herein permit the incorporation of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) peptides (e.g., phosphopeptide, lipopeptides or glycopeptide) into a T-Cell-MMP to form a T-Cell-MMP-epitope conjugate. Epitopes peptides of a T-Cell-MMP conjugate are not part of the first or second polypeptide as translated from mRNA, but are added to a T-Cell-MMP at a chemical conjugation site. Selection of candidate MHC allele and (e.g., phosphopeptide, lipopeptides or glycopeptide) epitope combinations for effective presentation to a TCR by a T-Cell-MMP-epitope conjugate, can be accomplished using any of a number of well-known methods to determine if the free peptide has affinity for the specific HLA allele used to construct the T-Cell-MMP in which it will be presented as part of the epitope conjugate, and to determine if the peptide in combination with the specific heavy chain allele and \u03b2 can affect the T-cell in the desired manner (e.g., induction of proliferation, anerty or apoptosis). Applicable methods include binding assays and T-cell activation assays.</p>a. Cell-Based Binding Assays</p>As one example, cell-based peptide-induced stabilization assays can be used to determine if a candidate peptide binds an HLA class I allele intended for use in a T-Cell-MMP-epitope conjugate. The binding assay can be used in the selection of peptides for incorporation into a T-Cell-MMP-epitope conjugate using the intended allele. In this assay, a peptide of interest is allowed to bind to a TAP-deficient cell, i.e., a cell that has defective transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) machinery, and consequently, few surface class I molecules. Such cells include, e.g., the human T2 cell line (T2 (174\u00d7CEM.T2; American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) No. CRL-1992)). Henderson et al. (1992) Science 255:1264. Without efficient TAP-mediated transport of cytosolic peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum, assembled class I complexes are structurally unstable, and retained only transiently at the cell surface. However, when T2 cells are incubated with an exogenous peptide capable of binding class I, surface peptide-HLA class I complexes are stabilized and can be detected by flow cytometry with, e.g., a pan anti-class I monoclonal antibody, or directly where the peptide is fluorescently labeled. The stabilization and resultant increased life-span of peptide-HLA complexes on the cell surface by the addition of a peptide validates their identity. Accordingly, binding of candidate peptides for presentation by various Class I HLA heavy chain alleles can be tested by genetically modifying the T2 cells to express the HLA H allele of interest.</p>In a non-limiting example of use of a T2 assay to assess peptide binding to HLA A*0201, T2 cells are washed in cell culture medium, "
