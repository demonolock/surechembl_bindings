    "ic showing overlapping peptides (full length (SEQ ID NO: 24) and P1-P7, SEQ ID NOs: 25-31, respectively) used to narrow down the region(s) binding to CD74. Mouse CD74 (FIG. 4B) or mouse H2M (FIG. 4C) were immunoprecipitated with specific monoclonal antibodies adsorbed to Protein A/G beads and then a pool of the overlapping peptides (\u201call\u201d) or individual peptides were added. Immune complexes were washed extensively and bound peptides were eluted with electrophoresis sample buffer containing 1% SDS. Eluted material was analyzed by electrophoresis by SDS-peptide gels in Tris-Tricine. Gels were then scanned for the fluorophore in a BioRad Molecular Imager FX.</p>FIGS. 5A-5C are a series of panels showing binding of P2 or P7 peptides to CD74 or Fab G5. Peptides P2 and P7 were tested individually for their ability to bind immunoprecipitated mouse CD74 or FabG4 adsorbed to Protein A/G beads and Protein L beads, respectively (FIG. 5A). Only P2 was able to bind CD74 and Fab G4. P7 was unable to bind to any of the targets. The location of the P2 peptide in the DR\u03b11-hMOG-35-55 polypeptide is shown in FIG. 5B. Competition experiment showed that DR\u03b11-hMOG-35-55 was able to outcompete the binding of the FITC-labeled P2 peptide to immunoprecipitated CD74 with a relative affinity (K<sub>D</sub>) of 750 nM (FIG. 5C).</p>FIGS. 6A and 6B are graphs showing binding of constructs to rhCD74. Constructs DR\u03b11-hMOG-35-55 and DRhQ were assessed for direct binding to rhCD74 onto ELISA plates by direct binding assay with or without G4 Fab during the binding (FIG. 6A). The K<sub>D </sub>calculated polypeptides were 0.65 \u03bcM for DR\u03b11-hMOG-35-55 and 0.089 \u03bcM for DRhQ. In a competitive experiment, DRhQ showed higher activity against rhMIF to bind CD74 compared to the DR\u03b11-hMOG-35-55 (FIG. 6B).</p>FIGS. 7A and 7B are graphs showing effect of constructs in EAE mice. C57BL/6 WT male mice between 8 and 12 weeks of age were immunized as described in Material and Methods. DRhQ or DR\u03b11-hMOG-35-55 protein (FIG. 7A) or DR\u03b11-nMOG-35-55 or DRmQ (FIG. 7B) (100 \u03bcg in 0.1 ml) was injected s.c. daily for 5 days beginning at an EAE score of \u22652.0 and the mice were scored for clinical signs of EAE (top panels). Mean EAE scores and SDs for mouse groups were calculated for each day from day 8 through day 27 post-immunization and summed for each mouse by numerically integrating the EAE score curve over the entire experiment (CDI, represents total disease load; bottom panels).</p>FIG. 8 is a panel showing ERK1/2 phosphorylation assay. Two million splenocyte cells from EAE mice were treated with vehicle, DRhQ or DR\u03b11-hMOG-35-55 for 30 minutes and then cells were lysed in the presence of protease and phosphatase inhibitor. Supernatants were analyzed by electrophoresis and Western blot to evaluate P-ERK1/2 and total ERK1/2 (T-ERK1/2). DR\u03b11-hMOG (not shown) and DRhQ were able to downregulate ERK1/2 phosphorylation in vitro.</p>FIG. 9A is a cartoon-rendered structure model of DRhQ that shows the position "
