    "nd can be used for treating mammiferous proliferative disease.It is cell fission of the cell that ordered about by one or more members in this receptor kinases family that these inhibitor can stop those its divisions.Can comprise that wherein expectation stops the splitted normal cell, for example those cross expression or sudden change cell transformed because of this kinases family, as EGFR, FRB-B2 and ERB-B3 in the breast cancer cell of prognosis mala cross to express and ERB-B2 is mutated into the principal element that oncoprotein NEU is cell transformation.In view of preferred compound less than highly toxic and do not demonstrate strong growth-inhibiting character (because they are high specials to the restraining effect of EGFR kinases family), so it should have clearer toxicity curve than most of antitumor and inhibition of cell proliferation medicines.They should be beneficial to the present very different mode of action of antitumor drug and use it for those expections and have in the synergistic multiple medicines thing treatment with available therapeutical agent.</p>Shown that compound of the present invention is incorporated into kinase whose Triphosaden (ATP) binding site with high-affinity, and become the reversible inhibitor of strong EGF receptor tyrosine kinase.Be derived from the phosphorylation of peptide of the phosphorylation site of protein PLC-\u03c5 1 (a kind of known EGFR phosphorylated substrate) based on detection, it is very strong promptly from the IC50 value of 10 \u03bc M to 50 \u03bc M to find that these compounds have the tyrosine kinase activity performance of enzyme.These data are shown in Table 1.</p>Biological data material and method</p>The purifying of epidermal growth factor recipient tyrosine kinase-with following method separation of human EGF receptor tyrosine kinase from cross the A431 people's epidermoid carcinoma cell express the EGF acceptor.Increase culturing cell in the revolving bottle of supporting base (Gibco) in Eagle substratum that is added with the 50%DelbucoShi improvement and the 50%HAMF-12 nutrition that contains 10% foetal calf serum.Two volumes contain 20mM2-(4N-(2-hydroxyethyl) piperazine-1-yl) ethyl sulfonic acid (Hep-es) (pH7.4), the inferior ethylene glycol bis of 5mM (the amino ether of 2-) N, N, N ' is in the damping fluid of N '-tetraacethyl, 1%Tritom X-100,10% glycerine, 0.1mM sodium orthovanadate, 5mM Sodium Fluoride, 4mM tetra-sodium, 4mM benzamide, 1mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 80 \u03bc g/ml aprotinins, 40 \u03bc g/mL leupeptins and 1mM phenyl methyl sulfonic acid fluoride about 10\n        <sup>9</sup>Individual cytolysis.With 25,000g is after centrifugal 10 minutes, with 10mL wheat germ agglutinin-agarose that before balance had been crossed in 50mM Hepes, 10% glycerine, 0.1%Triton X-100 and 150mM NaCl (pH7.5) (level pad) with 4 \u2103 of balances of supernatant liquor 2 hours.With the 1M NaCl protein that flush away pollutes from the resin that is added in the level pad, and, use 1mM urea wash-out enzyme more earlier with the 0.5M N-ethanoyl-1-D-glycosamine that is added in the level pad.With 0.1mg/ml EGF wash-out enzyme.With coomassie blue painted polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel estimation acceptor homogeneous seemingly.\n      </p>The mensuration of IC50 value---containing 25mM Hepes (pH7.4), 5mM MgCl\n        <sub>2</sub>, 2mM MnCl\n        <sub>2</sub>, 50 \u03bc M vanadic acid sodiums, 5-10ng EGF receptor tyrosine kinase, 200 \u03bc M peptide substrate (Ac-Lys-His-Lys-Lys-Leu-Ala-Glu-Gly-Ser-Ala-Tyr\n        <sup>472</sup>-Glu-Glu-Val-NH\n        <sub>2</sub>, (proved Tyr according to what aminoacid sequence was derived\n        <sup>472</sup>Be be subjected to the effect of EGF receptor tyrosine kinase and four tyrosine among PLC (the Phospholipase C)-r1 of phosphorylation it-(Wah1, M.I.; Nishibe, S; Kim, J.W.; Kim, H.; Rhee, S.G.; Carpenter, G.J.Biol.Chem., (1990), 265,3944-3948), and the enzyme sequence deutero-peptide around from this site is the fabulous substrate of enzyme), contain 1 \u03bc Ci (\n        <sup>32</sup>P) carries out among the 10 \u03bc M ATP of ATP, and at room temperature be incubated 10 minutes.Add 2ml 75mM phosphoric acid termination reaction, and by 2.5cm phosphorylated cotton filter membrane with in conjunction with this peptide.With 75mM phosphoric acid filter membrane is washed 5 times and is placed in the tubule that contains 5mL scintillation solution (Readygel Beckman).\n      </p>Table 1EGF receptor tyrosine kinase restraining effect\n        Embodiment\n                    <sup>#</sup>                                    ????EGFR?IC\n                    <sub>50</sub>                                    ????1                                                                            ????\uff1c100pM                       "
