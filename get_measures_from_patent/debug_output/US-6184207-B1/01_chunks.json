    "as ethanolamine, methylamine, diethylamine, isopropylamine, trimethylamine and the like.</p>As stated above, the peptides of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, will have beneficial pharmacological effect in warm-blooded animals (including man) in a range of autoimmune diseases or medical conditions, to treat symptoms or as a disease modifying agent or as a prophylactic treatment. Such diseases may include, for example, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, (Goodpasture's syndrome, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, coeilac disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis, Sjogren syndrome, myasthenia gravis, Type 1 (insulin dependent) diabetes, Hashimoto's disease, Grave's disease, Addison's disease, scieroderma, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, pemphigus vulgaris, bullous pemphigoid, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, pernicious anaemia, glomerulonephritis, graft rejections and such like, especially rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.</p>The utility of the peptides of the formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, may be assessed using a variety of standard tests and clinical studies, including those described in International Patent Application, Publication Nos. WO92/02543, WO93/05011 and WO95/07707 (or modifications thereof) and those described below. The peptides of formula I show significant activity in one or more of such tests or studies. Test A: Purified HLA-DR peptide in vitro binding assay. (This assay may be used to demonstrate the binding of the peptides of formula I to disease-associated MHC class II molecules.) 30 \u03bcl of biotin-FHA 307-320 (FHA (307-320) peptide, derivatised with long-chain biotin at the N-terminus, Biotin-Ahx-Pro-Lys-Tyr-Val-Lys-Gln-Asn-Thr-Leu-Lys-Leu-Ala-Thr-Gly-OH) (SEQ ID NO: 8) at 800 nM in phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS) is incubated with 30 \u03bcL of purified HLA-DR4Dw4 at a concentration between 0.5 and 5 \u03bcg/ml in V-welled micro-titre plates (Nunc) for 48 hours with or without inhibitor peptides. At the end of the incubation period 100 \u03bcl of the incubate is transferred to Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbant Assay (ELISA) plates (Nunc) previously coated with an anti-MHC antibody (L243-American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) HB55 as described in Lampson and Levy (1980) J. Immunol. 125, 293-299) at a concentration of 10 \u03bcg/ml for 1 hour at room temperature and blocked thereafter for 1 hour with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS and 0.05% Tween 20. After a further 1 hour period the unbound peptide is washed away and a 1/4,000 dilution of streptavidin peroxidase (Sigma) in PBS with 0.01% of a suitable detergent such as NP-40 (Sigma) added for 2 hours at room temperature. After further washing tetramethylbenzidene (TMB) substrate solution (1 TMB tablet (Sigma) in 10 mls of 0.1M citrate/acetate buffer, pH 6.0 with 36 \u03bcl urea hydrogen peroxide (UHPO) (Fluka)) is added to each of the plates. The reaction is stopped by adding 2M",
    " beneficial release profiles. Furthermore, peptides of the present invention containing one or more basic groups, particularly arginine, can also form peptide-polymer salts with acid-ended polyesters, such as polylactides, and such peptides and peptide-polymer salts constitute a further aspect of the present invention. Certain such salts possess solubility characteristics which make them particularly suitable for the manufacture and processing of slow release parenteral formulations, for example as described in WO93/24150, and for providing slow release formulations with beneficial release profiles and storage stability characteristics. A preferred slow release parenteral formulation contains from 1 to 100 mg (such as 5 to 50 mg) of polypeptide per unit dose. A preferred slow release parenteral formulation is also one designed for slow release over a period of at least 5 days.</p>Preferred peptides of the present invention include those which, when in the form of an extruded polymer depot formulation, show minimal loss due to degradation on extrusion or which show minimal degradation on release from such a depot formulation. Typical procedures for measuring the level of degradation of a peptide of the present invention are as follows:</p>Preparation of Extruded Polymer Depot Formulation of Peptide</p>About 20 mg of peptide is accurately weighed and sufficient polymer (50/50% molar poly(D,L-lactic acid/glycolic acid) copolymer of approximate weight average molecular weight 20 kD and approximate polydispersity of 1.7 as determined by size exclusion chromatography relative to polystyrene standards) added to produce an approximate 20% w/w mixture. This is dissolved in anhydride-free glacial acetic acid to produce an approximate 10% w/v solution. The solution is freeze dried and the resulting freeze dried product is stored under vacuum prior to use.</p>About 100 mg of freeze dried material is loaded into the barrel of a small laboratory extruder and the plunger pushed down to consolidate the sample. The extruder is heated to between 90 and 95\u00b0 C. and held at this temperature for 10 minutes before the freeze dried material is extruded under pressure to give a cylindrical extrudate of approximately 1 mm in diameter.</p>Analysis of Peptide Content of Extruded Polymer Depot Formulation of Peptide</p>Two approximate 5 mm lengths of extruded polymer depot containing peptide are accurately weighed and each dissolved in 1 ml of anhydride-free glacial acetic acid in separate 25 ml volumetric flasks. After about 1.5 hours the volume of each is made up to 25 ml with distilled water, causing the polymer to precipitate. The solids are filtered off using a 0.5 \u03bcm Millex PTFE filter and the solutions, A, collected.</p>A series of standard solutions are prepared from a stock solution of peptide in distilled water at 0.5 mg/ml and a stock solution of polymer in anhydride-free glacial acetic acid at 2.5 mg/ml as follows with each solutions made up to 10 ml with distill"
