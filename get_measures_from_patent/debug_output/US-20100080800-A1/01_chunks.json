FIG. 7A is the comparison of <sup>13</sup>C CPMAS spectra and fits for U-<sup>13</sup>C Tyr10 and Val12 lableled amyloid \u03b2 1-42 fibres incubated with PBS (left; served as control) or AC1-7 C2 (right) for 24 hrs and then lyophilized. The fits for the two conformations of Val12 C\u03b2 are shown in sheet and random coil. The peak at c33 ppm corresponds to the beta sheet conformation of the fibres whilst that at 30 ppm is a result of random coil conformation. FIG. 7B is the comparison of the fitted parameters for the two conformations of Val12 C\u03b2. The fitted chemical shifts for the two conformations are quite similar but the integral intensities are very different, reflecting a reduction in the original beta sheet conformation by approx 35% (1-(53.5/81.7)). This is in very close agreement with the value we obtained from the fluorescence measurement.</p>FIG. 8 (Example 12): Binding Affinity of humanized C2 in ELISA.</p>FIG. 9 (Example 14): Conformation specific binding of mC2 to different classes of amyloid protein.

    " \u201cantibodies\u201d as used herein are art-recognized terms and are understood to refer to molecules or active fragments of molecules that bind to known antigens, particularly to immunoglobulin molecules and to immunologically active portions of immunoglobulin molecules, i.e molecules that contain a binding site that specifically binds an antigen. An immunoglobulin is a protein comprising one or more polypeptides substantially encoded by the immunoglobulin kappa and lambda, alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon and mu constant region genes, as well as myriad immunoglobulin variable region genes. Light chains are classified as either kappa or lambda. Heavy chains are classified as gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon, which in turn define the immunoglobulin classes, IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE, respectively. Also subclasses of the heavy chain are known. For example, IgG heavy chains in humans can be any of IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 subclass. The immunoglobulin according to the invention can be of any class (IgG, IgM, IgD, IgE, IgA and IgY) or subclass (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1 and IgA2) of immunoglobulin molecule.</p>As used herein \u201cspecifically binds\u201d in reference to an antibody means that the antibody binds to its target antigen with greater affinity that it does to a structurally different antigen(s).</p>A typical immunoglobulin structural unit is known to comprise a tetramer. Each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one \u201clight\u201d (about 25 kD) and one \u201cheavy\u201d chain (about 50-70 kD). The N-terminus of each chain defines a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The terms variable light chain (V<sub>L</sub>) and variable heavy chain (V<sub>H</sub>) refer to these light and heavy chains respectively.</p>Antibodies exist as full length intact antibodies or as a number of well-characterized fragments produced by digestion with various peptidases or chemicals. Thus, for example, pepsin digests an antibody below the disulfide linkages in the hinge region to produce F(ab\u2032)<sub>2</sub>, a dimer of Fab which itself is a light chain joined to V<sub>H</sub>-CH<sub>1 </sub>by a disulfide bond. The F(ab\u2032)<sub>2 </sub>may be reduced under mild conditions to break the disulfide linkage in the hinge region thereby converting the F(ab\u2032)<sub>2 </sub>dimer into an Fab\u2032 monomer. The Fab\u2032 monomer is essentially a Fab fragment with part of the hinge region (see, Fundamental Immunology, W. E. Paul, ed., Raven Press, N.Y. (1993), for a more detailed description of other antibody fragments). While various antibody fragments are defined in terms of the digestion of an intact antibody, one of skill will appreciate that any of a variety of antibody fragments may be synthesized de novo either chemically or by utilizing recombinant DNA methodology. Thus, the term antibody, as used herein also includes antibody fragments either produced by the modification of whole antibodies or synthesized de novo or antibodies and fragments obtained by using recombinant DNA methodologies.</p>\u201cAntibodies\u201d are intended within the scope of the present invention to include monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, chimeric, single chain, bispecific, simianized, human and humanized antibodies as well as active fragments thereof. Examples of active fragments of molecules that bind to known antigens include separated light and heavy chains, Fab, Fab/c, Fv, Fab\u2032, and F(ab\u2032)<sub>2 </sub>fragments, including the products of an Fab immunoglobulin expression library and epitope-binding fragments of any of the antibodies and fragments mentioned above.</p>These active fragments can be derived from an antibody of the present invention by a number of techniques. For example, monoclonal antibodies can be cleaved with an enzyme, such as pepsin, and subjected to HPLC gel filtration. The appropriate fraction containing Fab fragments can then be collected and concentrated by membrane filtration and the like. For further description of general techniques for the isolation of active fragments of antibodies, see for example, Khaw, B. A. et al. J. Nucl. Med. 23:1011-1019 (1982); Rousseaux et al. Methods Enzymology, 121:663-69, Academic Press, 1986.</p>Recombinantly made antibodies may be conventional full length antibodies, active antibody fragments known from proteolytic digestion, unique active antibody fragments such as Fv or single chain Fv (scFv), domain deleted antibodies, and the like. An Fv antibody is about 50 Kd in size and comprises the variable regions of the light and heavy chain. A single chain Fv (\u201cscFv\u201d) polypeptide is a covalently linked VH::VL heterodimer which may be expressed from a nucleic acid including VH- and VL-encoding sequences either joined directly or joined by a peptide-encoding linker. See Huston, et al. (1988) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 85:5879-5883. A number of structures for converting the naturally aggregated, but chemically separated light and heavy polypeptide chains from an antibody V region into an scFv molecule which will fold into a three dimensional structure substantially similar to the structure of an antigen-binding site. See, e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,091,513, 5,132,405 and 4,956,778.</p>The combining site refers to the part of an antibody molecule that participates in antigen binding. The antigen binding site is formed by amino acid residues of the N-terminal variable (\u201cV\u201d) regions of the heavy (\u201cH\u201d) and light (\u201cL\u201d) chains. The antibody variable regions comprise three highly divergent stretches referred to as \u201chypervariable regions\u201d or \u201ccomplementarity determining regions\u201d (CDRs) which are interposed between more conserved flanking stretches known as \u201cframework regions\u201d (FRs). In an antibody molecule, the three hypervariable regions of a light chain (LCDR1, LCDR2, and LCDR3) and the three hypervariable regions of a heavy chain (HCDR1, HCDR2 and HCDR3) are disposed relative to each other in three dimensional space to form an antigen binding surface ",

(FIG. 5) Both the VK-R and the VK-S antibodies are comparable to the chimeric C2 antibody, indicating that the individual modifications to CDRL2 chosen do not markedly affect the activity of the antibody in the assay.</p>Example 10Affinity DeterminationTo assess the binding specificity and affinity of mouse (ACI-01-Ab-7-C2) chimeric (AF) and humanized antibodies (H4K1; H4K4), BIACORE.RTM. analysis was performed using amyloid beta 1-42 monomers and fibers as antigen immobilized on a CM5 chip. BIACORE.RTM. technology utilizes changes in the refractive index at the surface layer upon binding of the antibody to the antigen immobilized on the layer. Binding is detected by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of laser light refracting from the surface. Analysis of the signal kinetics on rate and off rate allows the discrimination between non-specific and specific interaction. The concentration of antibody used was in the range of 0.05 \u03bcM to 1.0 \u03bcM.</p>TABLE 1Binding specificity and affinity of mouse (ACI-01-Ab-7-C2) chimeric (AF)and humanized antibodies (H4K1; H4K4) for amyloid beta 1-42 monomers and fibersMonomersKDFibersk<sub>a </sub>(1/Ms)k<sub>d </sub>(1/s)(M)k<sub>a </sub>(1/Ms)k<sub>d </sub>(1/s)KD (M)Mouse ACI-01-Ab-7-C21.8E+042.7E\u2212031.5E\u2212072.4E+049.9E\u2212044.1E\u221208chimeric AF4.7E+049.5E\u221204\u2002\u20092E\u2212085.1E+043.3E\u2212046.5E\u221209humanized H4K15.0E+049.5E\u2212041.9E\u2212084.9E+042.3E\u2212044.7E\u221209humanized H4K42.5E+044.4E\u2212041.8E\u2212081.3E+053.0E\u2212042.3E\u221209</p>Example 11Immunhistochemical Binding Assay11.1 Human Brain SectionsBrains from healthy, non-demented pre-AD and AD patients were obtained from the Universit\u00e4tsklinik in Bonn after ethical approval. Brains were fixed in formaldehyde and the hippocampus region was dehydrated, embedded in paraffin and 5 \u03bcm sections were cut with a microtome. Paraffin sections were stored at RT until use.

After 3 washes in Tris buffered saline (TBS, pH 7.5), non-specific labeling was blocked by a 2 hour incubation of the slides in 10% BSA, 0.25% Triton X-100 in TBS. After washing (3 washes in TBS) blocking of endogenous antibodies was performed by adding a non-labeled anti-human IgG (Biomeda) and incubating slides in humid chambers overnight at RT. After another 3 washes, the primary human anti amyloid an"
