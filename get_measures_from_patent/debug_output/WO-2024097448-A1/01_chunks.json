In some embodiments herein, the use of MVAAE5R-Flt3L- OX40L (MQ710), MVAAE3LAE5R-Flt3L-OX40LAWR199 (MQ832), MVAAE3LAE5R- hFlt3L-hOX40LAWR199-hIL-12 (MQ833), or combinations thereof as a vaccine adjuvant is in the context of administration to a subject with an ICB resistant tumor. </p>Target Antigens </p>[0168] The compositions and methods disclosed herein are not intended to be limited by the choice of antigen or neoantigen. While numerous examples of antigens and neoantigens are provided, the skilled artisan can easily utilize the adjuvant disclosed herein with an antigen or neoantigen of choice. Exemplary, non-limiting target antigens that may be used in therapeutic regimens of the present technology include tumor differentiation antigens, cancer testis antigens, neoantigens, viral antigens in the case of tumors associated with oncogenic virus infection, GPA33, HER2/neu, GD2, MAGE-1, MAGE-3, BAGE, GAGE-1, GAGE-2, MUM-1, CDK4, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, pl 5, gp75, beta-catenin, ErbB2, cancer antigen 125 (CA-125), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), RAGE, MART (melanoma antigen), MUC-1, MUC-2, MUC-3, MUC-4, MUC-5ac, MUC-16, MUC-17, tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related proteins 1 and 2, Pmel 17 (gplOO), GnT-V intron V sequence (N- acetylglucoaminyltransferase V intron V sequence), Prostate cancer psm, PRAME (melanoma antigen), P-catenin, EBNA (Epstein-Barr Virus nuclear antigen) 1-6, p53, kras, lung resistance protein (LRP) Bcl-2, prostate specific antigen (PSA), Ki-67, CEACAM6, colon-specific antigen-p (CSAp), NY-ESO-1, human papilloma virus E6 and E7, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the antigen comprises a neoantigen selected from the group consisting of M27 (REGVELCPGNKYEMRRHGTTHSLVIHD) (SEQ ID NO: 16), M30 (PSKPSFQEFVDWENVSPELNSTDQPFL) (SEQ ID NO: 17), M48 (SHCHWNDLAVIPAGVVHNWDFEPRKVS) (SEQ ID NO: 18), and combinations thereof. The target antigen may also be a fragment or fusion polypeptide comprising an immunologically active portion of the antigens listed above. \n\n Immune Checkpoint Blockade (ICB) Inhibitors </p>[0169] In some embodiments, use of MVAAE5R-Flt3L-OX40L (MQ710), MVAAE3LAE5R-Flt3L-OX40LAWR199 (MQ832), MVAAE3LAE5R-hFlt3L- hOX40LAWR199-hIL-12 (MQ833), or combinations thereof may be in combination with one or more immune checkpoint blockade inhibitors. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) inhibitors, such as antibodies targeting immune checkpoint proteins for example, have been at the forefront of immunotherapy and have been accepted as one of the pillars of cancer management options, including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Because immune checkpoints have been implicated in the downregulation of antitumor immunity, agents and antibodies targeting immune checkpoint proteins or their ligands (CTLA-4, PD-1, or PD-L1) have been successful in disinhibiting antitumor T-cells, thereby leading to proliferation and survival of activated T-cells. </p>[0170] Non-limiting examples of immune checkpoint blockade in"
