The tumor specific T cells are then infused into patients with cancer in an attempt to give their immune system the ability to overwhelm remaining tumor via T cells which can attack and kill cancer.</p>As used herein, \u201caffinity\u201d is the strength of binding of a single molecule (e.g., I domain) to its ligand (e.g., ICAM-1). Affinity is typically measured and reported by the equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>), which is used to evaluate and rank order strengths of bimolecular interactions.</p>A \u201cbinding molecular,\u201d refers to a molecule that is capable to bind another molecule of interest.</p>A \u201cchimeric antigen receptor (CAR)\u201d means a fused protein comprising an extracellular domain capable of binding to an antigen, a transmembrane domain derived from a polypeptide different from a polypeptide from which the extracellular domain is derived, and at least one intracellular domain. The \u201cextracellular domain capable of binding to an antigen\u201d means any oligopeptide or polypeptide that can bind to a certain antigen. The \u201cintracellular domain\u201d means any oligopeptide or polypeptide known to function as a domain that transmits a signal to cause activation or inhibition of a biological process in a cell.</p>A \u201cdomain\u201d means one region in a polypeptide which is folded into a particular structure independently of other regions.</p>An \u201celongation factor 1 (EF-1) \u03b1 promoter\u201d is derived from the human EEF1A1 gene that expresses the \u03b1 subunit of eukaryotic elongation factor 1. EF-1 \u03b1 promoter offers a broad host range.</p>An \u201cintegrin\u201d or \u201cintegrin receptor\u201d (used interchangeably) refers to any of the many cell surface receptor proteins, also referred to as adhesion receptors which bind to extracellular matrix ligands or other cell adhesion protein ligands thereby mediating cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion processes.

    "Phe-265 (F265S/F292G) provides an affinity of 6 nM, approximately 200,000-fold higher than the wild-type (WT) I domain (K<sub>D</sub>=1.5 mM) (FIG. 1C). To lock the C-terminal \u03b17-helix of F265S/F292G in the open position (FIG. 1A), Gly-311 can be replaced with Cys (G311C) in the F265S/F292G mutant (F265S/F292G/G311C, dubbed triple mutant or TM) to form a disulfide bond with the naturally unpaired Cys-125 (Table 2). Therefore, the monovalent affinities of individual I domain variants for ICAM-1 can be designed to span approximately six orders of magnitude (K<sub>D</sub>\u02dc1 nM to 1 mM), as measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) or estimated by flow cytometry (FIG. 1C, Table 2). The mutants in Table 2 are for illustration purpose only; the CARs of the present invention are not limited to these specific mutants. Mutants that have other mutations and have affinities to ICAM-1 between 1 mM to 1 nM can be made, tested, and selected according to methods known to a skilled person.</p>TABLE 2Sequence ofNameSEQ ID NO: 1AffinityWild-type (WT)G128-G3111.5mM*I288NG128-G311202\u03bcM**I309TG128-G311127\u03bcM**L295AG128-G31137\u03bcM**F292AG128-G31120\u03bcM*F292SG128-G3111.24\u03bcM**L289GG128-G311196nM**F292GG128-G311119nM*F265SG128-G311145nM*F265S/F292G (DM)G128-G3116nM*F265S/F292G/G311C (TM)E124-S313~1nM*R6.5scFv10nM****SPR measurements;**Estimated from flow cytometry mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values of ICAM-1-Fc binding to yeast cells expressing I domain variants<sup>3</sup>.

In one embodiment, the mutant may have one or more mutations at the amino acid residue 265, 288, 289, 292, 295, 309, or 311 of the wild-type I domain. For example, the mutant may have one or more mutations of I288N, I309T, L295A, F292A, F292S, L289G, F292G, F265S, F265S/F292G, or F265S/F292G/G311C, of the wild-type I domain. In general, combining two I domain mutations produces a mutant with a higher affinity than that of each parent mutant. For example, combining two mutants each having about 100 \u03bcM Kd typically produces a mutant having about 1 to about 10 \u03bcM Kd range. F292G is a very potent point mutation; combining F292G with other mutations increases I domain affinity to ICAM-1 to stronger than 100 nM Kd. The above numbering of the amino acid residues is in reference to the mature amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, and residue number 1 corresponds to the amino acid residue 26 of GenBank Accession No. NP_002200.</p>In one embodiment, the CAR of the present invention comprises I domain that binds ICAM-1 at an affinity between 1 mM to 1 nM Kd, preferably 1-200 \u03bcM Kd or 1-20 \u03bcM Kd.</p>In one embodiment, the CAR of the present invention comprises I domain that binds to ICAM-1 at an affinity between about 120 nM to about 1 nM Kd, e.g., F292G, F265S, F265S/F292G, and F265S/F292G/G311C.</p>In one embodiment, the CAR of the present invention comprises I domain that binds to ICAM-1 at an affinity between about 20 \u03bcM to about 120 nM Kd, e.g., F292A, F292S, and 1289G.</p>In one embodiment, the CAR of the present invention comprises I domain that binds to ICAM-1 at an affinity between about 200 \u03bcM to about 20 \u03bcM Kd, e.g., I288N, I309T, L295A, and F292A.</p>In one embodiment, the CAR of the present invention comprises I domain that binds to ICAM-1 at an affinity between about 1 \u03bcM to about 100 \u03bcM Kd, e.g., L296A, F292A and F292S.</p>In one embodiment, the CAR of the present invention comprises I domain that binds to ICAM-1 at an affinity between about 1 mM to about 200 \u03bcM Kd, e.g., wild-type and I288N.</p>In one embodiment, the CAR of the present invention comprises I domain that binds to ICAM-1 at an affinity between about 1 mM to about 100 \u03bcM Kd, e.g., wild-type, I288N, and I309T. The affinities in the above embodiments refer to the interaction between I domain and ICAM-1 in solution.</p>The CAR of the present invention comprises (ii) a transmembrane domain which spans the membrane. The transmembrane domain may be derived from a natural polypeptide, or may be artificially designed. The transmembrane domain derived from a natural polypeptide can be obtained from any membrane-binding or transmembrane protein. For example, a transmembrane domain of a T cell receptor \u03b1 or \u03b2 chain, a CD3 zeta chain, CD28, CD3-epsilon, CD45, CD4, CD5, CD8, CD9, CD16, CD22, CD33, CD37, CD64, CD80, CD86, CD134, CD137, ICOS, CD154, or a GITR can be used. The artificially designed transmembrane domain is a polypeptide mainly comprising hydrophobic residues such as leucine and valine. In preferred embodiments, the transmembrane domain is derived from CD28 or CD8, which give good receptor stability.</p>The CAR of the present invention comprises (iii) one or more co-stimulatory domains selected from the group consisting of human CD28, 4-1BB (CD137), ICOS-1, CD27, OX 40 (CD137), DAP10, and GITR (AITR). In embodiment, the CAR is a third generation and comprises two co-stimulating domains such as CD28 and 4-1BB.</p>The endodomain (the activating domain) is the signal-transmission portion of the CAR. After antigen recognition, receptors cluster and a signal is transmitted to the cell. The most commonly used endodomain component is that of CD3-zeta",

HistologyJurkat tumor xenografts were harvested, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, embedded in paraffin, and were cut to produce 5 \u03bcm sections (Microtome, Leica). Paraffin embedded sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) or hematoxylin only for CD3 immunostaining (performed by HistoWiz, Inc.). After euthanasia, mouse lungs were perfused via trachea with 4% paraformaldehyde, and each of five lobes was separated post fixation and embedded in paraffin. Liver tissue was harvested and processed identically for histology. Histological analysis was performed by an experienced pathologist.</p>ResultsExample 13. Expression and Characterization of SSTR2 in Jurkat T CellsWe constructed a lentivirus vector for expression of SSTR2 by inserting the human SSTR2 gene downstream of the elongation factor-1\u03b1 promoter<sup>35</sup>. With increasing lentivirus titer, 100% of Jurkat T cells were transduced to express SSTR2 as measured by antibody binding (FIG. 1A). Consistent with agonist-induced internalization of SSTR2<sup>36</sup>, incubation of T cells with the synthetic SSTR2 agonist octreotide, reduced surface expression of SSTR2 as indicated by reduced antibody binding (FIG. 1B). Labeling of SSTR2-transduced Jurkat T cells with <sup>68</sup>Ga-DOTATOC (hereafter referred to as DOTATOC) at concentrations ranging from 250 nM to 8 nM followed a first-order Langmuir isotherm equation, giving a dissociation constant (Kd) of 38 nM (FIG. 1C). In comparison, DOTATOC uptake by non-transduced T cells was approximately 10-fold lower. Similar to the Kd estimated by Langmuir isotherm, Scatchard analysis estimated the Kd of DOTATOC to be 32 nM and the site density of SSTR2 to be approximately 3.2\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>molecules per cell (FIG. 1D). Actual site density is likely to be lower due to recycling of SSTR2 after internalization of DOTATOC and some level of non-specific binding. Incubation of cells at 4\u00b0 C. to inhibit SSTR2 recycling resulted in an estimated site density of 1.8\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>molecules per cell; however, the affinity of DOTATOC for SSTR2 was also determined to be substantially lower (Kd=170 nM) at this temperature (FIG. 1D).</p>Example 14. PET Imaging of DOTATOC Uptake in SSTR2+ T Cell XenograftsTo examine the utility of SSTR2 for the detection of sparsely distributed T cells in tumors, we produced subcutaneous Jurkat T cell xenografts in mice with a mixture of SSTR2-transduced (referred to as SSTR2+) and non-transduced (wild-type) cells. These were titrated against each other immediately prior to xenografting to vary the levels of SSTR2 expressing cells within tumors from 0% to approximately 100%. Xenografted Jurkat T cell tumors began to show palpable growth at \u02dc30 days post xenograft and exhibited continuous growth for the next 25 days, reaching approximately 0.7 cm<sup>3 </sup>(FIG. 3A). Longitudinal measurement of tumor size across different SSTR2+ tumors revealed that the level of SSTR2 expression had no significant effect on the growth of Jurkat T cell tumors. We tested our ability to detect SSTR2 positive T cells within tumors when both their tumor density and absolute numbers ranged from low to high in both respects. Thus to cover this range, we initiated PET/CT imaging at 12 days post xenograft of 0% to 100% SSTR2+ tumors, that is, before we could detect palpable tumor growth, and continued imaging until 56 days post xenograft (FIG. 3B). The level of DOTATOC uptake by tumors was quantified as percent injection dose per volume (% ID/cm<sup>3</sup>) based on the region of interest (ROI) enclosing tumors. The ROIs were defined by tumor-size measure"
