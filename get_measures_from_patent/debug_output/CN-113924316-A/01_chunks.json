    "p>As shown in Table 7, the candidate antibody CD25Q2-BA9-IgG1 simulated killing activity test EC<sub>50</sub>A value of 0.2356, lower EC than control CD25-MA251-IgG1<sub>50</sub>The value of 0.3606 shows that the killing ability of the candidate antibody to SU-DHL-1 is better than that of the control group CD25-MA251-IgG 1.</p>The results show that the candidate antibody CD25Q2-BA9-IgG1 has good killing effect on cells expressing CD25, and the candidate antibody can reduce Treg cells expressing CD25 and inhibit Teff cells, so that the candidate antibody has better pharmaceutical effect.</p>3.3 BiaCore detection of antibody affinity</p>Antibody binding kinetics were measured using a BIAcore8K instrument based on surface plasmon resonance (SRP) technology. The anti-Human IgG antibody was amino-coupled to a CM5 biosensor chip by the GE anti Human IgG Fc amino-coupling kit (GE, cat # BR-1008-39) to obtain approximately 1000 Response Units (RU). For kinetic measurements, CD25 protein (10165-H08H, Chinesota, Yinqiao) was serially diluted 2-fold with HBS-EP +1 \u00d7 (GE, BR-1008-26) buffer, starting at 50nM, diluted 2-fold for 4 concentration gradients, and set at 0 concentration. Antibody to be tested: 2 mu g/mL, sample introduction time of 70s, flow rate of 5 mu L/min, and stability of 5 s; CD25 protein: binding for 60s, flow rate 30 uL/min, and dissociation for 450 s; regeneration: with 3M MgCl<sub>2</sub>buffer was regenerated 30s, Startup 3 times. The association constant (ka) and dissociation constant (KD) were calculated using a simple one-to-one Languir binding model (BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2), with the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) calculated as the ratio KD/ka. The affinity data for each antibody is shown in table 9.</p>TABLE 9 BiaCore assay candidate antibody binding kinetics data</p>Name of antibodyka(1/Ms)kd(1/s)KD(M)CD25Q2-BA3-IgG14.56E+051.36E-032.98E-09CD25Q2-BA9-IgG16.96E+055.86E-048.43E-10CD25Q11-CA36-IgG16.02E+049.66E-051.61E-09CD25Q3-BA125-IgG16.99E+053.01E-044.31E-10CD25Q11-BA402-IgG13.50E+052.12E-046.07E-10CD25Q11-BA410-IgG11.40E+066.74E-034.81E-09CD25Q11-BA415-IgG13.23E+051.99E-046.14E-10CD25Q11-BA428-IgG15.55E+052.10E-043.79E-10CD25Q14-BA443-IgG11.36E+052.01E-041.48E-09CD25Q14-BA448-IgG15.87E+055.31E-049.04E-10CD25Q14-BA458-IgG13.62E+052.16E-045.96E-10CD25Q14-CA705-IgG13.81E+057.52E-041.97E-09CD25Q14-CA707-IgG13.31E+059.44E-042.85E-09CD25Q14-CA721-IgG16.80E+053.65E-045.36E-10CD25Q11-CT848-IgG17.05E+052.18E-033.09E-09CD25Q8-BT942-IgG18.96E+043.39E-043.79E-09CD25-MA251-IgG11.76E+059.12E-045.19E-09</p>As shown in Table 9, the equilibrium dissociation constant KD value of the candidate antibody CD25Q2-BA9-IgG1 is 8.43E-10 which is lower than the KD value of the control group CD25-MA251-IgG1 which is 5.19E-09, which indicates that the affinity of the CD25 protein of the candidate antibody CD25Q2-BA9-IgG1 is better than that of the control group CD25-MA251-IgG 1.</p>As shown in Table 9, the equilibrium dissociation constant KD value of the candidate antibody CD25Q8-BT942-IgG1 is 3.79E-09 lower than that of the control group CD25-MA251-IgG1 by 5.19E-09, which indicates that the affinity of the CD25 protein of the candidate antibody CD25Q8-BT942-IgG1 is better than that of the control group CD25-MA251-IgG 1.</p>The results indicate that the candidate antibodies CD25Q2-BA9-IgG1 and CD25Q8-BT942-IgG1 have stronger targeting and binding properties on Treg cells expressing CD25, better killing effect, reduction of inhibition of the Treg cells on Teff cells and better pharmaceutical effect compared with the control group CD25-MA251-IgG 1.</p>3.4 cell blocking Activity of candidate antibodies</p>Cryopreserved PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cells, manufacturer: ALLCELLS Cat: PB003F-C) were thawed and co-cultured with 10. mu.g/mL of CD25 antibody in 96-U bottom plate for 30min, and the control group was labeled NoAb without antibody, followed by addition of IL2(0.1U/mL, 1U/mL, 10U/mL) for 10min (working medium: 1640+ 10% FBS containing 2mM L-glutamine and 10000U/mL Pen-Strep), to prepare a cell suspension: after the last wash, discard the supernatant and pulse vortex the sample to completely dissociate the precipitate; add 200. mu.L of Foxp3 fixation/rupture working solution per well.
