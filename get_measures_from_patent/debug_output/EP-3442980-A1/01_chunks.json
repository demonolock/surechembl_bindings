The assay was performed in 384-well white plates (Corning #3574) in a reaction volume of 10 \u03bc\u0399_ containing 1X CisBio enzymatic buffer supplemented with a final concentration of 5 mM MgCI<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 10 nM SEB and 0.01 % Triton X100 for RET. The same buffer conditions were used for KDR with the addition of 2 mM MnC . RET<sup>V804M</sup> buffer used 1X CisBio enzymatic buffer supplemented with a final concentration of 2 mM MgCI<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 20 nM SEB and 0.01 % Triton X100. </p> [00268] Inhibitors were pre-incubated in the plate for 15 mins with 5 \u03bc\u0399_ kinase and assay buffer at the following concentrations; 13 pM RET (Carna Biosciences; 08-159), 30 pM <sub>R ET</sub>v804M (MiHipore; 14-760) and 150 pM KDR (Millipore; 14-630). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 \u03bc\u0399_ ATP and substrate at 2X final reaction concentrations. For RET, this was 18 \u03bc\u039c and 2 \u03bc\u039c; for RET<sup>V804M</sup>, this was 4 \u03bc\u039c and 1 .5 \u03bc\u039c and for KDR, this was 16 \u03bc\u039c and 1 \u03bc\u039c, respectively. Reactions were performed at ATP K<sub>m</sub> for each target. The assay was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 30 mins before terminating with the addition of 10 \u03bc\u0399_ HTRF detection buffer containing EDTA supplemented with TK-antibody labelled with Eu<sup>3+</sup>- Cryptate (1 :100 dilution) and streptavidin-XL665 (128 nM).

Following removal of IL3, the modified cells are dependent on the activity of the recombinant kinase for survival and proliferation. The BaF3 cell lines, expressing KIF5B-RET (gift from Pasi Janne<sup>7</sup>), KDR and RET<sup>V804M</sup> (Advanced Cellular Dynamics, San Diego) were maintained in RPMI-1640 media containing 10% FBS and appropriate antibiotics. Non-modified BaF3 cells (WT) were maintained in RPMI-1640 media containing 10% FBS and supplemented with 10 ng/mL recombinant mouse IL3 (R&amp;D systems). For assessment of compound IC50, cells were plated into 384-well plates at 1500 or 3000 cells per well in 30 \u03bc\u0399_ culture medium and compounds dispensed using an acoustic liquid handling platform (LABCYTE). Following incubation of the cells for 48 hours at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere, viability was determined by addition of 10 \u03bc\u0399_ CellTiter-Glo reagent (Promega) and measurement of luminescence. </p> [00271] Cell activity data is presented in Table 2 below. </p>Table 2 - BaF3 Cell activity data </p> KIF5B-RET KDR IC50 BCR-RET(V804M IC<sub>50</sub> BaF3 IC50</p>EXAMPLE IC<sub>50</sub>(MM) (\u03bc\u039c) (\u03bc\u039c) (\u03bc\u039c)</p>1 0.0691 1.93 0.64 2.53</p>2 0.0348 4.1 0.202 &gt;10</p>3 0.0928 3.65 1.5 3.82</p>4 0.0125 1.92 0.0272 2.54</p>5 0.038 3.16 0.0848 4.64</p>6 0.0435 2.42 1.07 3.27</p>7 0.0346 2.74 0.0859 4.64</p>8 0.0468 6.89 0.0975 6.89</p>9 0.0608 4.42 0.0836 &gt;10</p>10 0.539 2.39 1.15 4.53</p>11 0.164 6.05 2.71 8.92</p>12 0.119 7.39 1.73 &gt;10</p>13 0.107 &gt;10 1.56 &gt;10</p>14 0.166 &gt;10 0.142 &gt;10</p>15 1.62 4.91 1.32 4.92</p>16 5.02 &gt;10 1.98 &gt;10</p>17 0.508 &gt;10 0.429 &gt;10</p>18 0.0111 0.554 0.0143 &gt;10</p>19 0.664 5.49 0.615 &gt;10</p>20 0.472 &gt;10 0.711 &gt;10</p>21 0.411 &gt;10 0.41 &gt;10</p>22 0.138 &gt;10 0.114 &gt;10</p>23 0.265 &gt;10 0.362 &gt;10</p>24 0.38 &gt;10 0.692 &gt;10</p>25 0.21 &gt;10 1.35 &gt;10</p>26 0.46 &gt;10 0.538 6</p>27 0.475 4.91 0.556 4.88 \n\n 0.0896 4.24 0.0678 6.4</p>0.0191 4.64 0.151 9.73</p>&gt;10 &gt;10 &gt;10 &gt;10</p>1 .19 &gt;10 4.29 &gt;10</p>5.91 &gt;10 &gt;10 &gt;10</p>0.555 &gt;10 0.308 &gt;10</p>1 .51 &gt;10 3.87 &gt;10</p>0.0199 2.07 0.0264 &gt;10</p>0.0164 1 .01 0.0338 6.56</p>0.17 &gt;10 2.55 &gt;10</p>0.101 8.24 0.235 &gt;10</p>0.185 &gt;10 0.602 &gt;10</p>0.0159 0.905 0.0779 4.29</p>0.05 3.56 0.129 6.85</p>&gt;10 &gt;10 &gt;10 &gt;10</p>0.0537 5.03 0.083 &gt;10</p>3.15 &gt;10 6.94 &gt;10</p>3.43 &gt;10 &gt;10 &gt;10</p>&gt;10 &gt;10 &gt;10 &gt;10</p>0.0417 1 .39 0.445 4.6</p>0.0685 6.38 0.1 17 &gt;10</p>0.0502 5.88 0.0985 &gt;10</p>0.192 9.09 0.361 &gt;10</p>0.71 4"
