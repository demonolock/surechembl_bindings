    " or more microbes or microbe-specific antibodies disclosed herein can be also be determined indirectly by determining the presence or absence of one or more antibodies that are specific to the one or more microbes in a tissue sample. RNA expression methods include but are not limited to extraction of cellular mRNA and Northern blotting using labeled probes that hybridize to transcripts encoding all or part of the gene, amplification of mRNA using gene-specific primers, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), followed by quantitative detection of the gene product by a variety of methods; extraction of RNA from cells, followed by labeling, and then used to probe cDNA or olignonucleotides encoding the gene, in situ hybridization; and detection of a reporter gene. </p> [0082] Methods to measure protein expression levels include but are not limited to Western blot, immunoblot, ELISA, radioimmunoassay, immunoprecipitation, surface plasmon resonance, chemiluminescence, fluorescent polarization, phosphorescence, immunohistochemical analysis, microcytometry, microarray, microscopy, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), and flow cytometry. The methods can also include specific protein property-based assays based including but not limited to enzymatic activity or interaction with other protein partners. Binding assays can also be used, and are well known in the art. For instance, a BIAcore machine can be used to determine the binding constant of a complex between two proteins. Other suitable assays for determining or detecting the binding of one protein to another include, immunoassays, such as ELISA and </p>radioimmunoassays. Determining binding by monitoring the change in the spectroscopic can be used or optical properties of the proteins can be determined via fluorescence, UV absorption, circular dichroism, or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Alternatively, \n\n immunoassays using specific antibody can be used to detect the expression on of a particular protein on a tumor cell. </p> [0083] The disclosed methods also provide for the quantification and/or qualification of susceptibility of a desired treatment based on the identification (or absence of such identification) of one or more microbes. Said information can lead to therapeutic decisions. </p> [0084] Protein array. Disclosed herein are polypeptide or protein arrays. In some aspects, the protein arrays can comprise probes including antibodies, aptamers, and other cognate binding ligands specific to a component of the microbe panels disclosed herein. Protein arrays and methods of constructing the protein arrays are well known to one of ordinary skill in the art. </p> [0085] One type of protein array that can be suitable uses an immobilized</p>\"capture antibody.\" The polypeptides are bound to a solid substrate (e.g., glass) with a treated surface (e.g., aminosilane) or through a biotin-streptavidin conjugation. The arrays are then incubated "
