The Kinase-Glo\u00ae Luminescent Kinase Assay can be used with virtually any kinase and substrate combination.</p>Also the buffer conditions may vary depending on the kinase of interest (e.g. for PKA a composition of 40 mM Tris pH 7.5, 20 mM MgC2, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, in 50 final volume is used). Typically the range of ATP titration is 0.1 \u03bcM to 10 \u03bcM.</p>The optimal kinase substrate results in the greatest change in luminescence when comparing kinase reaction wells with no kinase wells.</p>The optimal amount of kinase is determined by making two fold serial dilutions across plates using the optimal amount of ATP and optimal kinase substrate. The optimal amount of kinase to use in subsequent compound screens and IC50 determinations is the amount required for luminescence to be within the linear range of the kinase titration curve (sigmoidal dose response).</p>Robotized Kinase-Glo\u00ae Assay</p>This assay was set up for the measurement of kinase activity and/or inhibition. It is homogeneous, suitable for all type of protein kinases, quick and radioactivity-free.</p>We established the assay in 384 well-plates: the test mix consisted of:\n1) 3\u00d7 Enzyme mix (done in Kinase Buffer 3\u00d7), 5 \u03bcl/well2) 3\u00d7 substrate and ATP mix (done in ddH2O), 5 \u03bcl/well3) 3\u00d7 compound of formula (I) (diluted into ddH2O\u20143% DMSO)\u20145 \u03bcl/well)\n</p>As an outcome, the percentage of inhibition at 10 \u03bcM was evaluated for each compound tested: see below for compound dilution and assay scheme. Each enzyme had its own buffer constitution, substrate type and concentration. Incubation time instead was 90 min for all targets.</p>Test compounds were received as a 1 mM solution in 100% DMSO into 96 well plates. The plates were diluted to 30 M in ddH2O, 3% DMSO; 4 plates are reorganized in 384 well plate by dispensing 5 \u03bcl of each 96 wp into quadrants of a 384 wp. In well P23 and P24 the internal standard inhibitor staurosporine was added.</p>Assay Scheme</p>Test plates were first added with 5 \u03bcl of the compound dilution (30 \u03bcM, corresponding to 3\u00d7 dilution) and then loaded onto a robotized station together with one reservoir for the Enzyme mix (3\u00d7) and one for the ATP mix (3\u00d7), specific for each target under study.</p>To start the assay, the robot aspirated 5 \u03bcl of ATP/Substrate mix, made an air gap inside the tips (5 \u03bcl) and aspirated 5 \u03bcl of Enzyme mix. The subsequent dispensation into the test plates allowed the kinase reaction to start after 3 cycles of mixing, done by the robot itself by up and down pipetting. At this point, the correct concentration was restored for all reagents.</p>The robot incubated the plates for 90 minutes at room temperature, and then stopped the reaction by pipetting 15 \u03bcl of Kinase-Glo\u00ae reagent into the reaction mix. Three cycles of mixing were done immediately after the addition of the reagent.</p>The principle of the Kinase-Glo\u00ae technique is the presence in the reagent mixture of oxygen, luciferin and luciferase enzyme: in the presence of ATP, remaining from the kinase reaction, oxi-luciferin is produced with the emission of light, directly dependent on the amount of ATP. For optimal performances of this technique, the kinase reaction should utilize at least 15-20% of the available ATP.</p>After another 60 minutes of incubation to stabilize the luminescent signal, the plates were read on a ViewLux\u00ae instrument. Data were analyzed using the software package Assay Explorer\u00ae that provided percent inhibition data.</p>As example herein are reported the assay conditions used for testing the compounds of formula (I) against ALK (the ALK protein was prepared as described in WO2009013126, the substrate ALKtide YFF APCo was obtained in batches of &gt;95% peptide purity from American Peptide Company, Inc.

After 90 minutes of incubation, add 15 \u03bcl/well of Kinase-Glo reagent. After 60-90 minutes of incubation to stabilize the luminescent signal, the plates are read on a ViuwLux instrument.\n</p>The compounds of the present invention were found active at a concentration from 10 to 10000 nM.</p>Biochemical Assay for Inhibitors of PIM-1 Kinase Activity</p>The inhibitory activity of putative kinase inhibitors and the potency of selected compounds were determined using a trans-phosphorylation assay.</p>Specific peptide or protein substrates are trans-phosphorylated by their specific ser-thr or tyr kinase in the presence of ATP traced with <sup>33</sup>P-\u03b3-ATP, and in the presence of their own optimal buffer and cofactors.</p>At the end of the phosphorylati",

Dilution of Compounds\n</p>Test compounds are received as a 1 mM solution in 100% DMSO, distributed into 96 or 384 well plates:\na) for percent inhibition studies (HTS), individual dilution plates at 1 mM are diluted at a 3\u00d7 concentration (30 \u03bcM) in ddH2O (3% DMSO=final concentration) using a Beckman NX automated pipetting platform. The same instrument is used for distributing the diluted mother plates into the test plates.b) for IC50 determination (KSS platform), 100 \u03bcl of each compound at 1 mM in 100% DMSO are transferred from the original plate into the first column of another 96 well plate (A1 to G1); well H1 is left empty for the internal standard inhibitor, usually staurosporine.\n</p>An automated station for serial dilutions (Biomek FX, Beckman) is used for producing 1:3 dilutions in 100% DMSO, from line A1 to A10, and for all the seven compounds in the column. Moreover, 4-5 copies of daughter plates are prepared by reformatting 5 \u03bcL of this first set of 100% DMSO dilution plates into 384 deep well-plates: one copy of the daughter plates with the serial dilutions of test compounds will be thaw the day of the experiments, reconstituted at a 3\u00d7 concentration with water and used in the IC50 determination assays. In a standard experiment, the highest concentration (3\u00d7) of all compounds is 30 \u03bcM, while the lowest one is 1.5 nM.</p>Each 384 well-plate will contain reference wells (total enzyme activity vs. no enzymatic activity) for the Z\u2032 and signal to background evaluation.\nii.

The following dispensation into the plates allows the kinase reaction to start upon 3 cycles of mixing, done by the robot itself.</p>At this point, the correct concentration is restored for all reagents.</p>The robot incubates the plates for 60 minutes at room temperature, and then stops the reaction by pipetting 70 \u03bcL of dowex resin suspension into the reaction mix. Three cycles of mixing are done immediately after the addition of the resin.</p>The resin suspension is very dense; in order to avoid tip clogging, wide bore tips are used to dispense it.</p>Another mixing cycle is performed after all the plates are stopped, this time using normal tips: the plates are then allowed to rest for about one hour in order to maximize ATP capture. At this point, 20 \u03bcL of the supernatant are transferred into 384-Optiplates (Perkin-Elmer), with 70 \u03bcL of Microscint 40 (Perkin-Elmer); after 5 min of orbital shaking the plates are read on a Perkin-Elmer Top Count radioactivity counter.</p>iii.
