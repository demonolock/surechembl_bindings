The modification is modulated by two enzymes: OGT transfers O-GlcNAc onto proteins from the UDP-GlcNAc sugar donor and OGA catalyzes hydrolysis of the sugar moiety and (B) the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway leading to the biosynthesis of UDP- GlcNAc, where endocyclic heteroatom is denoted X (O in nature and S in the synthetic compounds according to some embodiments). </p> [0039] FIGURE 1C shows the structure of 5SGlcNAc, UDP-5SGlcNAc,/?MP- 5SGlcNAc, and Me-5SGlcNAc (X = O or S). </p>[0040] FIGURE ID shows in vitro enzymatic synthesis of UDP-5SGlcNAc catalyzed by the human enzymes of the HBP and monitored by capillary electrophoresis; the \n\n traces shows absorbance at 254 nm as a function of retention time.

    "ide sugar substrate precursor or variant or analog thereof that is readily cell permeable and is capable of being utilized in an endogenous biosynthetic pathway to form the GT inhibitor. </p> [0081] In some embodiments, a GT inhibitor may be constructed by replacing the endocyclic oxygen atom found in sugars to a different group including, without limitation, sulphur, selenium, or CH<sub>2</sub>, such that enzymes in biosynthetic pathways involved in the formation of a nucleotide sugar still process the sugar analogue to form, within tissues, an analogue of the natural nucleotide sugar in which the endocyclic ring oxygen is replaced by the group present in the sugar analogue precursor. Accordingly, by using sugar analogues in which the endocyclic oxygen is replaced by certain groups, the sugar analogue is assimilated by these salvage and biosynthetic pathways to form the unnatural nucleotide sugar analogue having the group present in place of the endocyclic sugar ring oxygen. \n\n [0082] In some embodiments, the resulting nucleotide sugar analogue is either not a substrate or it is a worse substrate for the GT than is the naturally occurring nucleotide sugar used by the GT. In some embodiments, the unnatural nucleotide sugar analogue binds to and thereby inhibits the GT. In some embodiments, the activity of the GT is impaired and the levels of the glycoconjugates normally biosynthesized by the GT decrease. The levels of the GT may, in some cases, increase to compensate for its inhibition. </p> [0083] In the exemplary embodiment of OGT inhibition, as described herein, we show that the change from oxygen to sulphur was subtle enough for the enzymes in the salvage and biosynthetic pathways to tolerate the synthesis of the nucleotide sugar analogue, but sufficient to impair the ability of OGT to use the nucleotide sugar analogue and cause inhibition of OGT. </p> [0084] Other sugars having the endocyclic oxygen or other group replaced by a different group, as described herein, will also feed into the normal biosynthetic pathways of the cell to form nucleotide sugar analogues. These nucleotide sugar analogues are poor substrates for GTs that process their preferred natural nucleotide sugar substrates. Without being bound to any particular hypothesis, it is expected that because the nucleotide sugar analogues are turned over poorly by GTs, yet resemble the natural nucleotide sugar substrates used by these GTs, these nucleotide sugar analogues inhibit the normal functioning of these GTs both in vitro and in tissues and in vivo. </p> [0085] In alternative embodiments, unnatural sugar- 1 -phosphate analogues in which the endocyclic ring oxygen is replaced for example by CH<sub>2</sub>, S, or Se, or which have other S or Se substitutions as described herein, may be used in the biosynthesis within cells of the corresponding unnatural nucleotide sugar which would, as discussed herein, inhibit GTs processing the corresponding natural nucleotide sugar phosphate. Several examples are provided herein, for example, formulae VI-X, wherein the sugar- 1 -phosphate is derivatized. Certain compounds described by these formulae are assimilated by intracellular biosynthetic pathways to form the unnatural nucleotide sugar that will inhibit the corresponding GT(s). Accordingly, a number of sugars, \n\n including GlcNAc, GalNAc, ManNAc",
    "nder high stringency conditions. In some embodiments, high stringency conditions are, for example, conditions that allow hybridization comparable with the hybridization that occurs using a DNA probe of at least 500 nucleotides in length, in a buffer containing 0.5 M NaHP0<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.2, 7% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, and 1% BSA (fraction V), at a temperature of 65\u00b0C, or a buffer containing 48% formamide, 4.8x SSC, 0.2 M Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, lx Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, and 0.1% SDS, at a temperature of 42\u00b0C. (These are typical conditions for high stringency northern or Southern hybridizations.) Hybridizations may be carried out over a period of about 20 to 30 minutes, or about 2 to 6 hours, or about 10 to 15 hours, or over 24 hours or more. High stringency hybridization is also relied upon for the success of numerous techniques routinely performed by molecular biologists, such as high stringency PCR, DNA sequencing, single strand </p>conformational polymorphism analysis, and in situ hybridization. In contrast to northern and Southern hybridizations, these techniques are usually performed with relatively short probes (e.g., usually about 16 nucleotides or longer for PCR or sequencing and about 40 nucleotides or longer for in situ hybridization). The high stringency conditions used in these techniques are well known to those skilled in the art of molecular biology, and examples of them can be found, for example, in Ausubel et al.<sup>76</sup>. </p> [0093] By \"inhibits,\" \"inhibition\" or \"inhibiting\" means a decrease by any value between 10% and 90%, or of any integer value between 30% and 60%, or over 100%, or a decrease by 1-fold, 2-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold or more. It is to be understood that the inhibiting does not require full inhibition. In some embodiments, an inhibitor of a GT reduces the levels of glycoconjugates biosynthesized by the GT. In some \n\n embodiments, an inhibitor of an OGT decreases or reduces O-GlcNAc levels e.g., O- GlcNAc-modified polypeptide or protein levels, in cells, tissues, or organs (e.g., in pancreatic, brain, muscle, adipose, hepatic, blood, skin, eye, nervous system tissue) and in animals. By \"reduced,\" \"reduces\" or \"reducing\" is meant a decrease by any value between 10% and 90%, or of any integer value between 30% and 60%, or over 100%, or a decrease by 1-fold, 2-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold, 15-fold, 25-fold, 50-fold, 100- fold or more. </p> [0094] In some embodiments, the compounds of the present invention according to Formulae I or VI reduce O-GlcNAc levels on O-GlcNAc-modified polypeptides or proteins in vivo specifically via interaction with an OGT, and are effective in treating conditions which require or respond to inhibition of OGT activity. </p> [0095] In some embodiments, the compounds of the present invention are useful as agents that produce a decrease in the levels of specific sets of glycoconjugates. In some embodiments, the compounds such as those described in Formulae II-V or VII- X are therefore useful to treat conditions which require or respond to inhibition of GT activity, such as N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases, N- acetylgalactosaminyltransferases, fucosyltransferases, xylosyltransferases, sialyltransferases, mannosyltransferases, glucosyltransferases or </p>galactosyltransferases. </p>[0096] In some embodiments, the compounds of the present invention according to Formulae IV or IX reduce levels of fucose modified biomolecules in vivo via interaction with an FUT, and/or through decreasing GDP-Fuc levels in cells, and are effective in treating conditions which require or respond to decreased FUT activity. </p> [0097] In some embodiments, the invention provides methods of producing an antibody by contacting an antibody-producing cell with a fucosyltransferase inhibitor, such that an antibody with reduced levels of fucose is produced. By \"reduced levels of fucose\" is meant that the glycan structures present on the antibody contain decreased amounts of fucose. By \"reduced,\" \"reduces\" or \"reducing\" is meant a decrease by any value between 10% and 90%, or of any integer value between 30% and 60%, or over 100%, or a decrease by 1 -fold, 2-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold, 15-fold, 25- fold, 50-fold, 100-fold or more. \n\n [0098] In some embodiments, the compounds produce a decrease in levels of O- GlcNAc modification on O-GlcNAc-modified polypeptides or proteins, and are therefore useful for treatment of disorders responsive to such decreases in O-GlcNAc modification; these disorders include without limitation cancer, diabetes, insulin",
    "e\" or \"the </p>glycosyltransferase\" includes a particular enzyme as well as other family members and equivalents thereof as known to those skilled in the art. </p>[00135] Throughout this application, it is contemplated that the term </p> \"compound\" or \"compounds\" refers to the compounds discussed herein and includes precursors and derivatives of the compounds, including acyl-protected derivatives, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds, precursors, and derivatives. The invention also includes prodrugs of the compounds, pharmaceutical </p>compositions including the compounds and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and pharmaceutical compositions including prodrugs of the compounds and a </p>pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. </p>[00136] In some embodiments, the formulations, preparation, and compositions including compounds according to the invention include mixtures of anomers (alpha and beta) or include individual anomers (alpha or beta). In general, the compound may be supplied in any desired degree of purity. \n\n Therapeutic Indications </p> [00137] The invention provides methods of treating conditions that are modulated, directly or indirectly, by a GT such as N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases, N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases, fucosyltransferases, xylosyltransferases, sialyltransferases, mannosyltransferases, glucosyltransferases or </p>galactosyltransferases, or by sugar-modified protein levels, for example, a conditions which require or respond to inhibition of GT activity. </p>[00138] In some embodiments, the invention provides methods of treating conditions that are modulated, directly or indirectly, by an OGT or by O-GlcNAc- modified protein levels, for example, a condition that is benefited by inhibition of an OGT or by a reduction of O-GlcNAc-modified protein levels. Such conditions include, without limitation, cancer, diabetes, insulin resistance, complications of diabetes, or autoimmune disease. The compounds of the invention are also useful in the treatment of diseases or disorders related to deficiency or over-expression of OGT or accumulation or depletion of O-GlcNAc, or any disease or disorder responsive to glycosyltransferase inhibition therapy. Such diseases and disorders include, but are not limited to, cancer, diabetes, insulin resistance, complications of diabetes, or autoimmune disease. </p>[00139] Such diseases and disorders may also include diseases or disorders related to the accumulation or deficiency in the enzyme O-GlcNAcase. Also included is a method of protecting or treating target cells expressing proteins that are modified by O-GlcNAc residues, the dysregulation of which modification results in disease or pathology. </p>[00140] In some embodiments, the invention provides methods of treating conditions that are modulated, directly or indirectly, by an FUT, for example, a condition that is benefited by inhibition of an FUT. Such conditions include, without limitation, inflammation, automimmune disorders, cancer (e.g., tumour growth and/or metastasis), etc. The compounds of the invention are also useful in the treatment of diseases or disorders related to over-expression of an FUT, or any disease or disorder responsive to fucosyltransferase inhibition therapy. Such diseases and disorders include, but are not limited to, inflammation, automimmune disorders, cancer (e.g., \n\n tumour growth and/or metastasis), infections, (e.g., Helicobacter pylori infections,) glaucoma, atherosclerosis, etc. </p> [00141 ] By a \"cancer\" or \"neoplasm\" is meant any unwanted growth of cells serving no physiological function. In general, a cell of a neoplasm has been released from its normal cell division control, i.e., a cell whose growth is not regulated by the ordinary biochemical and physical influences in the cellular environment. In most cases, a neoplastic cell proliferates to form a clone of cells which are either benign or malignant. Examples of cancers or neoplasms include, without limitation, transformed and immortalized cells, tumours, and carcinomas such as breast cell carcinomas and prostate carcinomas. The term cancer includes cell growths that are technically benign but which carry the risk of becoming malignant. By \"malignancy\" is meant an abnormal growth of any cell type or tissue. The term malignancy includes cell growths that are technically benign but which carry the risk of becoming malignant. This term also includes any cancer, carcinoma, neoplasm, neoplasia, or tumor. </p>[00142] Most cancers fall within three broad histological classifications: </p>carcinomas, which are the predominant cancers and are cancers of epithelial cells or cells covering the external or internal surfaces of organs, glands, or other body",
    "etc.; liquid formulations such as syrups, injections, etc.; injections, drops, suppositories, pessaries. In some embodiments, compounds or pharmaceutical compositions in accordance with this invention or for use in this invention may be administered by inhalation spray, nasal, vaginal, rectal, sublingual, or topical routes and may be formulated, alone or together, in suitable dosage unit formulations containing conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles appropriate for each route of administration. </p> [00170] The compounds of the invention may be used to treat animals, including mice, rats, horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, cats, and monkeys. However, compounds of the invention can also be used in other organisms, such as avian species (e.g., chickens). The compounds of the invention may also be effective for use in humans. The term \"subject\" or alternatively referred to herein as \"patient\" is intended to be referred to an animal, preferably a mammal, most preferably a human, who has been the object of treatment, observation or experiment. However, the compounds, methods and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be used in the treatment of animals. Accordingly, as used herein, a \"subject\" may be a human, non- human primate, rat, mouse, cow, horse, pig, sheep, goat, dog, cat, etc. The subject may be suspected of having or at risk for having a condition requiring modulation of a GT activity, e.g., O-GlcNAcase activity or inhibition of OGT or FUT activity. </p> [00171 ] An \"effective amount\" of a compound according to the invention includes a therapeutically effective amount or a prophylactically effective amount. A \"therapeutically effective amount\" refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic result, such as inhibition of a GT, such as an FUT or OGT, reduction of O-GlcNAc levels, or treatment of any condition described herein. A therapeutically effective amount of a compound may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the compound to elicit a desired response in the individual. \n\n [00172] Dosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the compound are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. A \"prophylactically effective amount\" refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired prophylactic result, such as inhibition of a GT, such as an FUT or OGT, reduction of O-GlcNAc levels, or prevention of any condition described herein. Typically, a prophylactic dose is used in subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of disease, so that a prophylactically effective amount may be less than a therapeutically effective amount. A suitable range for therapeutically or prophylactically effective amounts of a compound may be any value from 0.1 nM-O.lM, 0.1 nM-0.05M, 0.05 \u03b7\u039c-15\u03bc or 0.01 \u03b7\u039c-10\u03bc\u039c. </p> [00173] In alternative embodiments, in the treatment or prevention of conditions which require modulation of a GT activity, such as an FUT or OGT activity, an appropriate dosage level will generally be about 0.01 to 1000 mg per kg subject body weight per day, and can be administered in singe or multiple doses. In some embodiments, the dosage level will be about 0.1 to about 250 mg/kg per day. It will be understood that the specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any particular patient may be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound used, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition, and the patient undergoing therapy. </p> [00174] It is to be noted that dosage values may vary with the severity of the condition to be alleviated.

The sub-cloning, protein over-expression and purification of nup62 was performed according to standard molecular biology procedures. Assays contained 30 \u03bc\u039c nup62, 20 \u03bc\u039c UDP-(5S)GlcNAc and 0.4 \u03bc\u039c OGT in 20 mM phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl (phosphate buffered saline; PBS), in a total volume of 100 \u03bc\u03af, and were allowed to proceed for an appropriate time between 10 min and 2 h at 37 \u00b0C in order to maintain a constant rate without substrate depletion. Reactions were quenched upon addition of an equal volume of ethanol, frozen at -20 \u00b0C for 1 h to precipitate proteins and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 min. 5 \u03bc\u039c GDP-Glc, an internal standard, was added prior to freezing. The supernatant was removed and lyophilized. Nucleotides and nucleotide sugars were extracted as described below for the cell lysates, resuspended in 200 iL H<sub>2</sub>0, and run by CE. Production of UDP was monitored at 254 nm; the concentration was determined from a standard curve of UDP standards, which were prepared in triplicate using the same procedure as the reactions, at a concentration of between 1 and 20 \u03bc\u039c. Controls in the absence of nup62 were subtracted to account for OGT-catalyzed hydrolysis of the UDP-sugars. </p> [00184] OGT inhibition: The ability of UDP-5 SGlcNAc to inhibit OGT activity was assessed using radiolabelled [<sup>3</sup>H]GlcNAc-UDP (American Radiolabel) as the donor and recombinant nup62 as the acceptor. Assays contained 18 \u03bc\u039c of nup62, 1 \u03bc\u039c of UDP-GlcNAc (constant specific activity of 0.5 Ci/mmol of [<sup>3</sup>H]-UDP-</p>GlcNAc), 100 nM OGT, and various concentrations (0-25 \u03bc\u039c) of UDP-5SGlcNAc in PBS. The F<sub>max</sub> for OGT was determined using high (30, 40 and 50 \u03bc\u039c) </p>concentrations of UDP-GlcNAc (containing 0.033, 0.025, 0.02 Ci/mmol specific activity, respectively). Reactions were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h (over which time OGT has been shown to retain constant activity). The assay mixture was applied to a 1.5 x 3 cm piece of nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) and allowed to air dry. </p>Membranes were rinsed with five washes (total 100 mL) of PBS and air dried. The \n\n membranes were loaded into scintillation vials, and 4 mL of scintillation fluid </p>(Amersham) was added. The tritium levels were quantified by liquid scintillation counter (BECKMAN LS6000). All reactions were performed in triplicate. The inhibitor concentration was plotted against the inverse of the rate, and the -AT; value was taken where the line of best fit intersected 1/^ </p> [00185] Cell culture: Cells were grown in an incubator at 37 \u00b0C and 5% C0<sub>2</sub> atmosphere.

    "DP-GlcNAc, the donor substrate used by OGT, as depicted in Figure IB. The first and rate-limiting step in the de novo pathway, where fructose-6-phosphate (diverted from glycolysis) is converted to glutamine-6-phosphate, is catalyzed by glutamine: fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT). Glutamine-6-phosphate is transformed into GlcNAc-6-phosphate by acetyl-CoA:D-glucosamine-6-phosphate N- acetyltransferase (GAT). The salvage pathway recycles cellular GlcNAc, which is converted into GlcNAc-6-phosphate by GlcNAc kinase (GNK). GlcNAc-6-phosphate is converted into GlcNAc- 1 -phosphate by GlcNAc mutase (AGM), and then to the end product, UDP-GlcNAc, by UDP-GlcNAc pyrophosphorylase (AGXl). The 5-thio analogue is converted via the salvage pathway to generate intracellular UDP- 5SGlcNAc. Ac-5SGlc Ac is deacetylated by cell esterases. </p> [00213] We evaluated whether 5SGlcNAc (Figure 1C) could be transformed into UDP-5SGlcNAc by human HBP enzymes. 5SGlcNAc was synthesized as described herein. Using this material, UDP-5SGlcNAc (Figure 1C) was prepared in a reaction containing 5SGlcNAc, ATP, UTP, and recombinant human GlcNAc kinase (GNK), GlcNAc mutase (AGM) and UDP-GlcNAc pyrophosphorylase (AGXl). The \n\n reaction, monitored by capillary electrophoresis (CE), showed the production of a UDP-sugar (Figure ID), which was purified and shown to be UDP-5SGlcNAc. </p>Therefore, UDP-5SGlcNAc can be biosynthesized from 5SGlcNAc by the mammalian enzymes of the HBP. </p> [00214] EXAMPLE IV: Inhibition of OGT by UDP-5SGlcNAc </p> [00215] We then assayed the ability of OGT to use UDP-5SGlcNAc as a donor using nup62 as an acceptor<sup>52</sup>'<sup>53</sup> and found it was an approximately 14-fold worse substrate as compared to UDP-GlcNAc. Since UDP-5SGlcNAc was found to be a relative poor substrate in this assay, we assessed its inhibitory activity toward OGT. Using radiolabeled UDP-GlcNAc as the donor, and nup62 as the acceptor, the amount of OGlcNAc transferred was evaluated in the presence of increasing concentrations of UDP-5SGlcNAc. UDP-5SGlcNAc is an effective inhibitor of OGT with a value of 8 \u03bc\u039c (Figure IE), indicating that it binds as well as the natural substrate UDP-GlcNAc (K<sub>m</sub> = 2-7 \u03bc\u039c)<sup>40</sup>'<sup>53</sup>. Therefore, UDP-5SGlcNAc is a poor substrate for OGT, and is a good inhibitor of OGT in vitro. </p> [00216] EXAMPLE V: Treatment of Cells with 5SGlcNAc </p> [00217] With these results in hand we evaluated the effect of treating cells with 5SGlcNAc. We treated cultured COS-7 cells for 24 hours with 5SGlcNAc as well as its peracetylated analogue (Ac-5SGlcNAc). Both compounds decreased O-GlcNAc levels in a dose-dependent fashion as evaluated by western blots using an O-GlcNAc- directed antibody (CTD110.6) (Figures 2 A and 2G). Other commercial O-GlcNAc antibodies (RL2 and HGAC85) reveal similar decreases in O-GlcNAc levels (Figure 2H). The western blots reveal the EC<sub>50</sub> values for Ac-5SGlcNAc and 5SGlcNAc to be 5 \u03bc\u039c and 700 \u03bc\u039c respectively, which is consistent with acetylation facilitating entry of 5SGlcNAc into cells. Hence in subsequent experiments we used Ac-5SGlcNAc. </p> [00218] We also observed a time-dependent decrease in OGlcNAc levels, with almost no O-GlcNAc being detectable after 24 hours (Figure 2B), Dosing for 5 days showed O-GlcNAc levels dropped in the first day and remained low (Figure 2C). In these studies there were no apparent changes in cell morphology or rate of proliferation at the doses assayed. We observed Ac-5SGlcNAc administration induced a compensatory decrease in OGA levels and an increase in OGT levels (Figure 2D). \n\n Despite OGA levels continuing to drop and OGT levels rising over 5 days of dosing, O-GlcNAc levels remained low and unchanged after 24 hours (Figure 2C). </p> [00219] We next investigated the reversibility of the effect of Ac-5 SGlcNAc treatment and found that following a change of media containing no compound, O- GlcNAc returned to basal levels within 24 hours (Figure 21). A time course and dose response study in CHO cells (Figures 2J-K), revealed a similar EC50 value (0.8 \u03bc\u039c). Various other cell lines showed equivalent responses (Figure 2L). </p> [00220] EXAMPLE VI: O-GlcNAc Levels on nup62 After Treatment with Ac- 5SGlcNAc </p> [00221 ] We next probed O-GlcNAc levels on an individual protein after treatment with Ac-5SGlcNAc by immunoprecipitating nup62 from cell lysates. To probe for O-GlcNAc on immunoprecipitated nup62 we used a commercial chemoenzymatic method<sup>54</sup> that involves chemoselective Staudinger ligation<sup>55</sup> of biotin to terminal GlcNAc residues. Labeled and unlabeled nup62 from cell lysates were probed with streptavidin (Figure 2E); nup62 from untreated cells shows clear O- Glc Ac modification, whereas nup62 derived from cells treated with Ac-5 SGlcNAc shows almost no modification. Previous studies revealed that nup62 can be observed as two bands under certain SDS-PAGE conditions; the upper band corresponds to O- GlcNAc modified nup62 whereas the lower band corresponds to deglycosylated nup62<sup>9</sup>'<sup>52</sup>. We therefore analyzed immunoprecipitated nup62 in this way and found that untreated cells yielded only the upper band in western blots and this species was heavily O-GlcNAc modified (Figure 2F). Treating this nup62 precipitate with a bacterial homologue of OGA (5/GH84<sup>43</sup>) greatly diminished ( -GlcNAc </p>immunoreactivity and the resulting deglycosylated nup62 appeared as a lower band. nup62 from cells treated with Ac-5SGlcNAc, however, appeared as a doublet of bands consist",
    "c (V<sub>m</sub>JE K<sub>M</sub> = 40.7 \u03bc\u03b9\u03b7\u03bf\u0390 s<sup>'1</sup> mg<sup>\"1</sup> M<sup>\"1</sup>). </p> [00224] An alternate process that could cause decreased O-GlcNAc levels in cells treated with Ac- 5 S GlcNAc is that the pool of UDP-GlcNAc in cells be greatly diminished. To verify that UDP-5SGlcNAc is being biosynthesized within cells, and to evaluate the cellular levels of UDP-GlcNAc and other nucleotide sugar donors, we treated COS-7 cells with different concentrations of Ac-5SGlcNAc. Analysis of the extracted UDP-sugars using CE (Figures 3A-B, F-G) revealed a dose dependent increase in the amount of UDP-5SGlcNAc in cells and a small decrease in UDP- GlcNAc levels. An additional peak corresponding to a synthetic standard of UDP- 5SGalNAc is also observed (Figures 3E-F), while uridine diphosphoglucose and uridine diphosphogalactose levels are unaffected. The marked accumulation of UDP- 5SGlcNAc is consistent with OGT being unable to use it as a substrate. At 50 \u03bc\u039c we find near complete loss of O-GlcNAc in the cell lines tested, yet UDP-GlcNAc levels are still more than 60% of basal levels; a decrease that is unlikely to account for the low (9-GlcNAc levels observed in treated cells. Therefore, 5SGlcNAc can efficiently traverse the HBP to form levels of UDP-5SGlcNAc that proficiently inhibit OGT in cells. \n\n [00225] EXAMPLE VI I: Cell Surface Glvcosylation </p> [00226] To assess whether cell surface glycosylation could be affected through changes in UDP-GlcNAc availability or inhibition of GlcNAc transferases within the secretory pathway, we treated COS-7 cells with a range of Ac-5SGlcNAc </p>concentrations and evaluated the effect on various glycans using lectin blots. All lectins tested showed no change in glycosylation, even at the high doses of Ac- 5SGlcNAc assayed (Figures 3C and H). These lectins probed for both high mannose (ConA and GNA) and complex N-glycans (PHA-L, SNA and MAA). We also examined the effect of Ac-5SGlcNAc on N-glycosylation of an individual protein. Immunoprecipitated IgG produced by a mouse hybridoma cell line appeared to possess only high mannose glycans. There appeared to be a slight decrease in GNA and ConA reactivity when using a very high dose of Ac-5SGlcNAc (Figures 3D and I). These collective observations are consistent with reports showing that EMEG32<sup>7\"</sup> cells, which are deficient in the biosynthesis of GlcNAc, have very low UDP-GlcNAc levels but N-glycosylation is virtually unaffected<sup>57</sup>. Apparently, -5% of the normal UDP-GlcNAc levels found in cells is sufficient for N-glycosylation<sup>57</sup>, a level much lower than that observed when using inhibitory concentrations of 5SGlcNAc to block OGT. </p> [00227] EXAMPLE IX: Cellular Responses to Ac-5SGlcNAc </p>[00228] Cellular responses to Ac-5SGlcNAc (9) treatment and consequent decreases in OGlcNAc levels were evaluated. In the studies and cell lines examined, there were qualitatively no apparent changes in cell morphology or rate of </p>prol",
    "oacetamido-2-deoxy-a-D-glucopyranose<sup>9</sup> (Ac-GlcNAz) or Ac-5SGlcNAz (41) revealed that only 5SGlcNAz decreased 0-GlcNAc levels. Proteins from cells treated with vehicle, Ac-GlcNAz , or Ac-5SGlcNAz (41) were collected and subjected to Staudinger ligation<sup>55</sup> with biotin phosphine (Figure 6A). Following the ligation, proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose and probed using streptavidin-horse radish peroxidase. Only proteins from cells treated with Ac-GlcNAz revealed any signal, whereas the signal from cells treated with vehicle were indistinguishable from those treated with Ac-5SGlcNAz (41) (Figure 6B). Similarly, we immunoprecipitated nup62 from cells treated with vehicle, Ac-GlcNAz, or Ac-5SGlcNAz (41), and prior to Staudinger ligation, incubated half of each sample with 5tf3H84<sup>43</sup>. The resulting blot, probed with streptavidin-HRP, once again only showed signal from nup62 immunoprecipitated from cells treated with Ac-GlcNAz, and only in the sample that \n\n 0 </p> had not been subjected to 5tGH84 hydrolysis (Figure 6C). The observation that Ac- 5SGlcNAz (41) decreases O-GlcNAc levels indicates that uridine diphospho-5-thio- N-azidoacetylglucosamine (UDP-5SGlcNAz) is formed within cells where it acts to inhibit OGT. The chemoselective ligation data, however, indicates that 5SGlcNAz does not accumulate on proteins to any measurable level. These data indicated that 5SGlcNAc does not accumulate on proteins, and that decreased O-GlcNAc levels arise from inhibition of OGT by UDP-5SGlcNAc. </p> [00231] EXAMPLE XI: Synthesis of Ac-5SGlcNAc analogues </p> [00232] A total of 27 analogues, as shown below, were synthesized based on the Ac-5SGlcNAc (9) template.
