E., et al., European Journal of Cancer. 30A: 484-490 (1994)) are rinsed twice in PBS, phenol red-free Trypsin-EDTA is diluted in the same PBS 1: 10. The cell layers are rinsed with IX Trypsin, extra Trypsin is poured out, and the cell layers are incubated at 37\u00b0C for ~ 2 min. The flask is tapped and checked for signs of cell detachment. Once the cells begin to slide off the flask, the complete media is added to kill the trypsin. The cells are counted at this point, then diluted to the appropriate concentration and split into flasks or dishes for further culturing (Usually 1:3 to 1:6 dilution).</p>\n  Preparation of MDA-MB-453 Cell Lvsate \n\n When the MDA cells are 70 to 85% confluent, they are detached as described above, and collected by centrifuging at 1000 g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C. The cell pellet is washed twice with TEGM (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM Sodium Molybdate, pH 7.2). After the final wash, the cells are resuspended in TEGM at a concentration of I\u03b87 cells/mL. The cell suspension is snap frozen in liquid nitrogen or ethanol/dry ice bath and transferred to -8O<sup>0</sup>C freezer on dry ice. Before setting up the binding assay, the frozen samples are left on ice-water to just thaw (~1 hr). Then the samples are centrifuged at 12,500 g to 20,000 g for 30 min at 4<sup>0</sup>C. The supernatant is used to set-up assay right away. If using 50 \u03bcL of supernatant, the test compound can be prepared in 50 \u03bcL of the TEGM buffer.</p>\n  Procedure for Multiple Compound Screening</p>\n  Ix TEGM buffer is prepared, and the isotope-containing assay mixture is prepared in the following order: EtOH (2% final concentration in reaction), 3H-R1881 or 3H-DHT (0.5 nM final Cone, in reaction) and Ix TEGM. [eg. For 100 samples, 200 \u03bcL (100 x 2) of EtOH + 4.25 \u03bcL of 1:10 3H- R1881 stock + 2300 \u03bcL (100 x 23) Ix TEGM]. The compound is serially diluted, e.g., if starting final cone, is 1 \u03bcM, and the compound is in 25 \u03bcL of solution, for duplicate samples, 75 \u03bcL of 4x1 \u03bcM solution is made and 3 \u03bcL of 100 \u03bcM is added to 72 \u03bcL of buffer, and 1:5 serial dilution.</p>\n  25\u03bcL of 3H-R1881 trace and 25 \u03bcL compound solution are first mixed together, followed by addition of 50 \u03bcL receptor solution. The reaction is gently mixed, spun briefly at about 200 rpm and incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight. 100 \u03bcL of 50% HAP slurry is prepared and added to the incubated reaction which is then vortexed and incubated on ice for 5 to 10 minutes. The reaction mixture is vortexed twice more to resuspend HAP while incubating reaction. The samples in 96-well format are then washed in wash buffer using The FilterMate\u2122 Universal Harvester plate washer (Packard). The washing process transfers HAP pellet containing ligand-bound expressed receptor to Unifilter-96 GF/B filter plate (Packard). The HAP pellet on the filter plate is incubated with 50 \u03bcL of MICROSCINT (Packard) scintillint for 30 minutes before being counted on the TopCount microscintillation counter (Packard). IC50S are calculated using Rl 881 as a reference.</p>\n  The compounds, Examples 1-1 through 1-19, and Examples 2-1 through 2-15, found in Tables 1 and 2, were tested in the above assay and found to have an IC50 value of 1 micromolar or less.</p>\n  Mammalian Two-Hybrid Assay for the Ligand-induced Interaction of N-Terminus and C-Terminus</p>\n  Domains of the Androgen Receptor (Agonist Mode: VIRCON)</p>\n  This assay assesses the ability of AR agonists to induce the interaction between the N- terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD) of rhAR that reflects the in vivo virilizing potential mediated by activated androgen receptors. The interaction of NTD and CTD of rhAR is quantified as ligand induced association between a Gal4DBD-rhARCTD fusion protein and a VP 16- rhARNTD fusion protein as a mammalian two-hybrid assay in CV-I monkey kidney cells. \n\n The day before transfection, CV-I cells are trypsinized and counted, and then plated at 20,000 cells/well in 96-well plates or larger plates (scaled up accordingly) in DMEM + 10% FCS. The next morning, CV-I cells are cotransfected with pCBBl (Gal4DBD-rhARLBD fusion construct expressed under the SV40 early promoter), pCBB2 (VP16 -rhAR NTD fusion construct expressed under the SV40 early promoter) and pFR (Gal4 responsive luciferase reporter, Promega) using</p>\n  LIPOFECTAMINE PLUS reagent (GIBCO-BRL) following the procedure recommended by the vendor. Briefly, DNA admixture of 0.05 \u03bcg pCBBl, 0.05 \u03bcg pCBB2 and 0.1 \u03bcg of pFR is mixed in 3.4 \u03bcL OPTI- MEM (GIBCO-BRL) mixed with \"PLUS Reagent\" (1.6 \u03bcL, GIBCO-BRL) and incubated at room temperature (RT) for 15 min to form the pre-complexed DNA. For each well, 0.4 \u03bcL LIPOFECTAMINE Reagent "
