    "action mixture was slowly acidified to pH 6-7 with 2N HCl, and extracted with ethyl acetate (2\u00d75 ml). The organic layer was separated, dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford the titled compound as a yellow solid (111 mg, 90%).</p>Example 5 HDAC Enzyme AssaysCompounds for testing were diluted in DMSO to 50 fold the final concentration and a ten point three fold dilution series was made. The compounds were diluted in assay buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, 0.001% Tween-20, 0.05% BSA, 20 \u03bcM TCEP) to 6 fold their final concentration. The HDAC enzymes (purchased from BPS Biosciences) were diluted to 1.5 fold their final concentration in assay buffer. The tripeptide substrate and trypsin at 0.05 \u03bcM final concentration were diluted in assay buffer at 6 fold their final concentration. The final enzyme concentrations used in these assays were 3.3 ng/ml (HDAC1), 0.2 ng/ml (HDAC2), 0.08 ng/ml (HDAC3) and 2 ng/ml (HDAC6). The final substrate concentrations used were 16 \u03bcM (HDAC1), 10 \u03bcM (HDAC2), 17 \u03bcM (HDAC3) and 14 \u03bcM (HDAC6). Five \u03bcl compounds and 20 \u03bcl of enzyme were added to wells of a black, opaque 384 well plate in duplicate. Enzyme and compound were incubated together at room temperature for 10 minutes. Five \u03bcl of substrate was added to each well, the plate was shaken for 60 seconds and placed into a Victor 2 microtiter plate reader. The development of fluorescence was monitored for 60 min and the linear rate of the reaction was calculated. The IC50 was determined using Graph Pad Prism by a four parameter curve fit.</p>INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE The contents of all references (including literature references, issued patents, published patent applications, and co-pending patent applications) cited throughout this application are hereby expressly incorporated herein in their entireties by reference.
