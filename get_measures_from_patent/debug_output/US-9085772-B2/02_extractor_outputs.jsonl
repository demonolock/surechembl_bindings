{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that meet the specified criteria. The text does not contain specific molecule names, IDs, or identifiers along with bioactivity metrics (IC50, Ki, Kd, EC50), numeric values, and units. The text primarily describes methods and procedures for detecting interactions and phosphorylation events involving ROR1 and other receptor tyrosine kinases, without providing specific quantitative data."}
{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences in the provided text that contain all four required components: a specific molecule name, ID or other identifier, a bioactivity metric (IC50, Ki, Kd, EC50 and their variations), a specific numeric value for that metric, and a unit for that value. The text appears to describe methods, materials, and experimental procedures, but does not report any specific bioactivity data."}
