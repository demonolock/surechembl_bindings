    "f the present invention is not particularly limited. Examples thereof include an expression product from a gene library, a synthetic low-molecular-weight compound library, a peptide library, a substance released from a bacterium, a liquid extract and a culture supernatant of cells (microorganisms, plant cells, animal cells), a purified or partially purified polypeptide, an extract derived from a marine organism, plant or animal, soil, and a random phage peptide display library. Further, the examples include an anti-ROR1 protein antibody, a peptide having a dominant negative phenotype over an ROR1 protein, and an RNA capable of binding to a transcription product of the ROR1 gene, which are described later. Moreover, the examples include a compound having a structure capable of binding to the ROR1 protein, which is designed based on the structure of the ROR1 protein.</p>One embodiment of the screening method of the present invention is a method, wherein the compound having an activity of suppressing a function of ROR1 is selected based on a suppression of a binding between ROR1 and a downstream signaling molecule represented by c-Src. Specifically, this method is a method comprising: a step of bringing ROR1 into contact with a signaling molecule such as c-Src in the presence of the test compound; a step of detecting a binding between ROR1 and them; and a step of selecting a compound having an activity of suppressing the binding.</p>This method can be carried out in an in vitro binding assay, for example, ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) using a purified ROR1 protein and c-Src purified or in a cell liquid extract, or a GST pull-down assay described in the present Examples. Specifically, His-labeled c-Src and GST-labeled ROR1 conjugated with affinity beads are brought into contact with each other in a buffer to which the test compound has been added; after washing, c-Src binding to ROR1 is detected using an anti-His antibody. If the amount of c-Src detected is smaller than the amount detected in the absence of the test compound, the test compound is evaluated as having an activity of suppressing a binding between ROR1 and c-Src. Besides, methods utilizing, for example, immunoprecipitation, yeast two-hybrid system, FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer), or surface plasmon resonance, or other similar methods can be used in the present invention.</p>ROR1 and c-Src used in this method do not necessarily have to be complete proteins, and may be peptides containing binding sites of the two. For example, an SH3 domain region of c-Src can be used. Examples of species from which ROR1 and c-Src are derived include human, monkey, mouse, rat, guinea pig, pig, cattle, sheep, goat, and the like, but are not limited thereto.</p>Typical examples of ROR1 used in the present invention include a protein (gene) specified under GenBank ACCESSION No. NP<sub>\u2014</sub>005003 (NM<sub>\u2014</sub>005012), when derived from human, and a protein (gene) specified under",
    "lation by ROR1 in the presence of the test compound; and a step of selecting a compound having an activity of suppressing the phosphorylation. This method can be carried out in, for example, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), western blotting analysis, In-Cell Western analysis, or the like using an anti-phosphorylated ROR1 antibody. Meanwhile, after immunoprecipitation with an anti-ROR1 antibody, a western blotting analysis may be performed using an anti-phosphorylated tyrosine antibody; alternatively, after immunoprecipitation with an anti-phosphorylated tyrosine antibody, a western blotting analysis may be performed using an anti-ROR1 antibody. If the amount of autophosphorylation of ROR1 detected is smaller than the amount detected in the absence of the test compound, the test compound is evaluated as having an activity of suppressing autophosphorylation of ROR1.</p>Another embodiment of the screening method of the present invention is a method, wherein the compound having an activity of suppressing a function of ROR1 is selected based on a suppression of a binding between ROR1 and a receptor tyrosine kinase such as EGFR, a suppression of a binding between other receptor tyrosine kinases (for example, a binding between EGFR and ErbB3) due to ROR1, and a suppression of phosphorylation of a receptor tyrosine kinase such as ErbB3 due to ROR1.</p>Regarding the binding between ROR1 and another receptor tyrosine kinase such as EGFR, it is possible to perform an in vitro binding assay, for example, ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) using a purified ROR1 protein or a partial peptide thereof (for example, a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of the ROR1 protein) and another receptor tyrosine kinase purified or in a liquid cell extract, a GST pull-down assay, or an immunoprecipitation-western blotting (IP-WB) analysis described in the present Examples. In an exemplary method in which another receptor tyrosine kinase is EGFR, His-labeled EGFR and affinity beads coated with GST-labeled ROR1 are brought into contact with each other in a buffer to which the test compound has been added; after washing, EGFR binding to ROR1 is detected using an anti-His antibody. If the amount of EGFR detected is smaller than the amount detected in the absence of the test compound, the test compound is evaluated as having an activity of suppressing a binding between ROR1 and EGFR. Besides, methods utilizing, for example, immunoprecipitation, yeast two-hybrid system, FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer), or surface plasmon resonance, and other similar methods can also be used.</p>The detection of phosphorylation of another receptor tyrosine kinase due to ROR1 can be carried out by an in vitro kinase assay or a western blotting analysis using an anti-phosphorylated ErbB3 antibody or the like as in the above-described case of detecting phosphorylation of c-Src due to ROR1.</p>EGFR, ErbB3, and the like used in this method do not necessarily have to be complete pr",

    "duction in lung adenocarcinoma.</p>Next, in order to elucidate a mechanism of how ROR1 controls c-Src, whether or not ROR1 bound to c-Src was examined. As a result, an interaction between ROR1 and c-Src exogenously introduced into COST cells (b in FIG. 4) and an interaction between endogenous c-Src and ROR1 transfected in 293T cells were clearly proved (c in FIG. 4). In addition, the in vitro pull-down assay using a purified ROR1 protein and a c-Src protein demonstrated a direct interaction therebetween (d in FIG. 4). Further, the immunoprecipitation-western blotting (IP-WB) analysis confirmed that endogenous ROR1 and c-Src interacted with each other in NCI-H1975 cells (e in FIG. 4). Moreover, the IP-WB analysis using various c-Src deletion mutants revealed that ROR1 bound to the SH3 domain of c-Src (f in FIG. 4). Furthermore, the GST pull-down assay using a lysate of NCI-H1975 cells also revealed that endogenous ROR1 interacted with the SH3 domain of c-Src (g in FIG. 4).</p>Example 5Verification of c-Src Phosphorylation Due to ROR1Next, whether or not c-Src was phosphorylated by ROR1 was examined. Specifically, the in vitro ROR1 kinase assay was performed using c-Src as a substrate, in which c-Src was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates of NCI-H23 and 293T cells. The examination result revealed that c-Src was phosphorylated by ROR1 (a in FIG. 5 (NCI-H23 cells) and b in FIG. 5 (293T cells)).</p>Further, it was confirmed using NIH3T3 cells expressing kinase dead c-Src (c-Src-KD) that the phosphorylation of c-Src was not due to an autophosphorylation reaction of c-Src. Note that c-Src-KD was a substrate having no autophosphorylation ability (c in FIG. 5).</p>Example 6Verification of PTEN Control Due to ROR1 Through c-Src Serving as Survival Signalingc-Src is known to induce an inactivation of PTEN by phosphorylating PTEN. It was revealed that if PTEN was simultaneously suppressed in NCI-H1975 cells, the influence on AKT phosphorylation induced by ROR1 suppression and the consequent growth suppression were almost eliminated (FIG. 6).</p>Thus, it was revealed that ROR1 bound to c-Src and phosphorylated c-Src, and that c-Src played a very important role of regulating pro-survival signaling through the ROR1-c-Src-PTEN-PI3K-AKT axis in lung adenocarcinoma.</p>Example 7Verification of Crosstalk Between ROR1 and ErbB FamilyIt is well understood that the ErbB family, particularly EGFR and ErbB3, play important roles in survival and growth of lung cancer. Moreover, recently, more importance has been placed on crosstalks among receptor tyrosine kinases. It is believed that receptors are present very close to each other on the cell membrane, and play a role of pro-survival signaling by communicating with each other. Hence, an analysis was performed by the immunoprecipitation-western blotting (IP-WB) method. As a result, it was revealed that ROR1 bound to EGFR under EGF stimulus. Moreover, it was found out that the interaction of the two was such that the binding was achieved at an extracellular region of ROR1 (a in FIG. 7). Further, detailed studies on the binding re"
