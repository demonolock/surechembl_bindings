    "l nervous system disorders of function that are characterized by recurrent, sudden, often brief attacks, which may alter consciousness, motor activity, sensory phenomena, and autonomic responses, and which may prompt inappropriate behavior. Recurrent seizure patterns of either an idiopathic or symptomatic etiology are terms epilepsy. The most common form of these recurrent but transient episodes are convulsive seizures, which may include loss of consciousness, motor function and control, and which may produce tonic or clonic jerking of the extremities. Pharmacological treatment of epilepsy has been directed to control based on seizure type, rather than etiology. Accordingly, the convulsions have been grouped in broad, but rather distinct types, including Tonic-clonic (Grand Mal), Partial (Focal) seizures, psychomotor (Complex partial) seizures, pyknoepileptic or Absence (Petit Mal) and the less frequent Myoclonic seizures.</p>The compounds of the current invention are also useful in the treatment of spasticity and acute muscle spasm. Spasticity represents not a single disorder, but rather a range of abnormalities of regulation of skeletal muscle that result from problems at various levels of the central nervous system. A predominant component is heightened muscle tone or hyper-excitability of tonic stretch muscle reflexes. While the pathopysiology of these disorders remains rather poorly understood, it often includes dysfunction of the descending spinal pathways. Presynaptic inhibition of motorneurons, as may be induced by GABA, or agents that in some respects resemble and/or exhibit the pharmacology of GABA provides some antispastic affect. Additionally, benzodiazepines, or drugs like compounds of the present invention that bind to the benzodiazepine receptor, may enhance the efficiency of inhibitory GABA-ergic transmission, and thus may provide some efficacy in the treatment or conditions of spasticity, particularly those due to spinal cord lesions. Acute muscle spasm may be associated with a variety of conditions including trauma, inflammation, anxiety, and pain.</p>The compounds of the current invention are useful for the treatment of sleep disorders. Difficulties in falling asleep, remaining asleep, sleeping for adequate lengths of time, or abnormal sleep behavior are common symptoms for those suffering with a sleep disorder. A number of sleep disorders, e.g., insomnia or sleep apnea, are described in the online Merck Manual of Medical Information. Insomnia is characterized by difficulty in sleeping or disturbed sleep patterns. Insomnia may be of a primary nature with little apparent relationship to intermediate somatic or psychic events, or secondary to some acquired pain, anxiety, or depression. Where possible, treatment is directed to the underlying cause of the condition; hypnotic medication is generally reserved for insomnia of emotional disturbances and for refractory cases due to more common causes.</p>Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines of the f",

Both central nervous system (\u201ccentral\u201d) and peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (\u201cperipheral\u201d) are encompassed by the use of this term.</p>The term \u201cIC<sub>50</sub>\u201d refers to the concentration causing a half-maximal inhibition of control specific binding.</p>In the compounds of the invention of formula I, R<sup>5 </sup>is chosen from C<sub>1 </sub>to C<sub>20 </sub>hydrocarbon, substituted aryl, heterocyclyl and substituted heterocyclyl.

Subgenera include compounds in which A is a carbocycle or substituted carbocycle and those in which A is a four, five, six, seven or eight-membered heterocyclyl or substituted heterocyclyl. Preferred compounds include those in which A is a four, five, six, seven or eight-membered lactam or substituted lactam, particularly an N-alkyl lactam. As is evident from inspection of the formula II, A is attached to the imidazopyridine through a carbon of A, not a heteroatom, if A is a heterocycle.</p>In compounds of formula I, m is one, two or three, preferably one.

The GABA<sub>A </sub>receptors are associated with chloride influx through its associated and integrated chloride channel, whereas GABA<sub>B </sub>receptor activation indirectly alters potassium and calcium channels as well as modifies second messenger production. The GABA<sub>A </sub>recognition sites can be activated by GABA, muscimol, and isoguvacine for example, but not by GABA<sub>B </sub>agonists such as baclofen. The modulatory GABA<sub>A </sub>recognition site at the benzodiazepine receptor sites can be selectively radiolabeled with <sup>3</sup>H-flunitrazepam. The affinity of various potential ligands for the benzodiazepine receptor sites can thus be evaluated by estimating the ability of test compounds to displace <sup>3</sup>H-flunitrazepam.</p>Compounds of the invention were assessed for their binding to the benzodiazepine receptor by the test of Speth et al. [Life Sci. 24, 351 (1979)] for central benzodiazepine receptors and LeFur et al. [Life Sci. 33, 449 (1983)] for peripheral receptors. The compounds were tested first at 1.0E-09, 1.0E-07 and 1.0E-05 M in single determination. In the assays where a compound showed a % inhibition higher than 50% at either concentration, it was tested further at five concentrations in duplicate to obtain competition curves. The specific ligand binding to the receptor is defined as the difference between the total binding and the nonspecific binding determined in the presence of an excess of unlabelled ligand. In each experiment, the respective reference compound was tested concurrently with the test compounds in order to assess the assay suitability. It was tested at several concentrations (for IC<sub>50 </sub>value determination), and the data were compared with historical values. The assay was rendered valid if suitability criteria were met.</p>For the aforementioned in vitro testing, compounds are defined herein to be active if they have at least 40% inhibition at 10 \u03bcM. For in vitro testing, compounds are defined to be inactive if they have less than 40% inhibition at 10 \u03bcM. Results of the in vitro testing of representative embodiments of the present invention are shown in Tables 1a, 1b, and 2. However, the invention is not limited to the compounds found in the Tables.</p>TABLE 1a<img id=\"EMI-C00093\" path=\"US07148353-20061212-C00093.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/69971203/US/20061212/B2/000007/14/83/53/US07148353-20061212-C00093.TIF\"/> IC50 (nM)IC50 (nM)R<sup>5</sup>centralperipheral\u2014CH<sub>2</sub>CH(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>&gt;10000820Phenyl1750386\u2014(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>4202694-chlorophenyl4060594 <img id=\"EMI-C00094\" path=\"US07148353-20061212-C00094.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/69971079/US/20061212/B2/000007/14/83/53/US07148353-20061212-C00094.TIF\"/>&gt;10000310 <img id=\"EMI-C00095\" path=\"US07148353-20061212-C00095.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/69971220/US/20061212/B2/000007/14/83/53/US07148353-20061212-C00095.TIF\"/>&gt;10000820 <img id=\"EMI-C00096\" path=\"US07148353-20061212-C00096.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/69971135/US/20061212/B2/000007/14/83/53/US07148353-20061212-C00096.TIF\"/>1900560 Methyl439231 <img id=\"EMI-C00097\" path=\"US07148353-20061212-C00097.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/69971177/US/20061212/B2/000007/14/83/53/US07148353-20061212-C00097.TIF\"/>38153 <img id=\"EMI-C00098\" path=\"US07148353-20061212-C00098.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/69971111/US/20061212/B2/000007/14/83/53/US07148353-20061212-C00098.TIF\"/>1400240 <img id=\"EMI-C00099\" path=\"US07148353-20061212-C00099.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/69971143/US/20061212/B2/000007/14/83/53/US07148353-20061212-C00099.TIF\"/>8401600 <img id=\"EMI-C00100\" path=\"US07148353-20061212-C00100.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/69971175/US/20061212/B2/000007/14/83/53/US0",
