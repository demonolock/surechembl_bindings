    "/p>(4) from the cultivation and the purifying antibody of the production antibody cell of SP2/0 cell</p>The cell clone of the anti-GD3 chimeric antibody of generation described in Japan's disclosed not unexamined patent application number 304989/93 (EP 533 199) (KM-871 (FERM BP-3512)) is suspended in the GIT substratum that contains 0.5mg/ml G418 and 200nM MTX, reaches 3 * 10\n          <sup>5</sup>The density of cells/ml, and at 175mm\n          <sup>2</sup>Add suspension in the culture dish (Greiner manufacturing).At 37 \u2103 of following 5%CO\n          <sub>2</sub>Cultivate after 8 days the results culture supernatant in the incubator.Adopt specification sheets from the culture supernatant purifying anti-GD3 chimeric antibody of Prosep-A (Bioprocessing manufacturing) post according to manufacturer.The anti-GD3 chimeric antibody called after SP2/0-GD3 chimeric antibody of purifying.\n        </p>5. the analysis of the anti-GD3 chimeric antibody of purifying</p>According to a kind of known method [Nature,\n          227, 680 (1970)], 5 kinds of 4 \u03bc g obtain in the 4th of embodiment 1 produces from corresponding zooblast and each of the anti-GD3 chimeric antibody of purifying, passes through SDS-PAGE with analyzing molecules amount and purification degrees.The result shows in Fig. 1.As shown in Figure 1, in the anti-GD3 chimeric antibody of each purifying, find that under non-reduced condition a molecular weight is approximately the 150 kilodaltons band of (after this being called \" Kd \"), under reductive condition, find the band of two about 50Kd and about 25Kd.Molecular weight with calculate that from the cDNA nucleotide sequence of the H chain of antibody and L chain the molecular weight that comes out is consistent (H chain: about 49Kd, L chain: about 23Kd, whole molecule: about 144Kd), also with the report consistent, the molecular weight of reporting IgG antibody is approximately 150Kd under non-reduced condition, the cut-out of disulfide linkage (after this being called \" S-S key \") is degraded to the L chain [antibody: lab guide that H chain that molecular weight is about 50Kd and molecular weight are about 25Kd under reductive condition because in the molecule, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, the 14th chapter (1998); Monoclonal antibody: principle and practice, Academic Press Limited (1 996)], therefore proof can be expressed each anti-GD3 chimeric antibody, and is purified as the antibody molecule with correct structure.\n        </p>Embodiment 2</p>The activity assessment of anti-GD3 chimeric antibody:</p>1. the combining of anti-GD3 chimeric antibody and GD3 active (ELISA)</p>5 kinds of anti-GD3 chimeric antibodies of purifying and combining of GD3 (SnowBrand Milk Products manufacturing) are active in the 4th of embodiment 1 measures by the ELISA method that shows among the embodiment 1 the 3rd.Fig. 2 shown that the concentration of adding anti-GD3 chimeric antibody by changing measures in conjunction with active detected result.As shown in Fig"
