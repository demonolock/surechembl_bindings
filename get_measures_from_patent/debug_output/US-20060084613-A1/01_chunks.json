    "ally according to Thomberry et al. (Nature 356:768:774 (1992)) and Nicholson et al. (Nature 376:37-43 (1995)) respectively, (herein incorporated by reference) in 96 well microtiter plates. The substrate is Acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) for the ICE assay and Acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-amino4-methylcoumarin for the CPP32, Mch2, Mch3 and Mch5 assays. Enzyme reactions are run in ICE buffer (25 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose, pH 7.5) containing 2 mM DTT at room temperature in duplicate. The assays are performed by mixing the following components: \n 50 \u03bcL ICE, Mch2, Mch5, CPP32 (18.8, 38, 8.1 and 0.153 nM concentrations, respectively) or Mch3 (1 unit) enzyme in ICE buffer containing either 8.0 (ICE, Mch2, Mch3, CPP32) or 20 (Mch5) mM DTT;  50 \u03bcL compound of Formula 1 or ICE buffer (control);. and  100 \u03bcL of 20 \u03bcM substrate. \n</p> The enzyme and the compound of Formula I to be assayed are allowed to preincubate in the microtitre plate wells for 30 minutes at room temperature prior to the addition of substrate to initiate the reaction. Fluorescent AMC product formation is monitored for one hour at room temperature by measuring the fluorescence emission at 460 nm using an excitation wavelength of 360 nm. The fluorescence change in duplicate (control) wells are averaged and the mean values are plotted as a function of inhibitor concentration to determine the inhibitor concentration producing 50% inhibition (IC<sub>50</sub>). </p> B.

The K<sub>i </sub>value is the overall dissociation constant of the reversible binding steps, and k<sub>3 </sub>is the irreversible rate constant. The [S] and K<sub>s </sub>values are the substate concentration and dissociation constant of the substrate bound to the enzyme, respectively.
