{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n1. The assays are performed by mixing the following components: 50 \u03bcL ICE, Mch2, Mch5, CPP32 (18.8, 38, 8.1 and 0.153 nM concentrations, respectively) or Mch3 (1 unit) enzyme in ICE buffer containing either 8.0 (ICE, Mch2, Mch3, CPP32) or 20 (Mch5) mM DTT;\n2. The fluorescence change in duplicate (control) wells are averaged and the mean values are plotted as a function of inhibitor concentration to determine the inhibitor concentration producing 50% inhibition (IC\u2085\u2080).\n3. The K\u2091 value is the overall dissociation constant of the reversible binding steps, and k\u2083 is the irreversible rate constant, however no specific numeric value is provided for these constants in the given text snippet. \n\nNote: There are limited relevant sentences in the provided text snippet. If more text is provided, more relevant sentences may be extracted."}
