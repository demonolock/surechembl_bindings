An agent includes, but is not limited to, a nucleic acid, an antibiotic, an anti-inflammatory agent, an antibody or fragments thereof, an antibody agent or fragments thereof, a growth factor, a cytokine, an enzyme, a protein, a peptide, a fusion protein, a synthetic molecule, an organic molecule (e.g., a small molecule), a carbohydrate, a lipid, a hormone, a microsome, a derivative or a variation thereof, a formulation or composition including one or more thereof, and any combinations thereof. An agent may bind any cell moiety, such as a receptor, an antigenic determinant, or other binding site present on a target or target cell. An agent may diffuse or be transported into a cell, where it may act intracellularly.</p>Antibody: As used herein, the term \u201cantibody\u201d refers to a polypeptide that includes canonical immunoglobulin sequence elements sufficient to confer specific binding to a particular target antigen. As is known in the art, intact antibodies as produced in nature are approximately 150 kD tetrameric agents comprising two identical heavy chain polypeptides (about 50 kD each) and two identical light chain polypeptides (about 25 kD each) that associate with each other into what is commonly referred to as a \u201cY-shaped\u201d structure. Each heavy chain comprises at least four domains (each about 110 amino acids long)\u2014an amino-terminal variable (VH) domain (located at the tips of the Y structure), followed by three constant domains: CH1, CH2, and the carboxy-terminal CH3 (located at the base of the Y's stem). A short region, known as the \u201cswitch\u201d, connects the heavy chain variable and constant regions. The \u201chinge\u201d connects CH2 and CH3 domains to the rest of the antibody. Two disulfide bonds in this hinge region connect the two heavy chain polypeptides to one another in an intact antibody. Each light chain comprises two domains\u2014an amino-terminal variable (VL) domain, followed by a carboxy-terminal constant (CL) domain, separated from one another by another \u201cswitch\u201d. Intact antibody tetramers comprises two heavy chain-light chain dimers in which the heavy and light chains are linked to one another by a single disulfide bond; two other disulfide bonds connect the heavy chain hinge regions to one another, so that the dimers are connected to one another and a tetramer is formed. Naturally-produced antibodies are also glycosylated, typically on the CH2 domain. Each domain in a natural antibody has a structure characterized by an \u201cimmunoglobulin fold\u201d formed from two beta sheets (e.g., 3-, 4-, or 5-stranded sheets) packed against each other in a compressed antiparallel beta barrel. Each variable domain contains thre"
