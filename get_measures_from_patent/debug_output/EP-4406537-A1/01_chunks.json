    "2 \u00b5L of the substrate mixture, and 2 \u00b5L of the enzyme (final concentration of 25 nM). Then 1 \u00b5L of different concentrations of compounds were added for incubation. Reaction conditions: 30 min, 37 \u00b0C. Then 2.5 \u00b5L of ADP Reagent from ADP-Glo Kit was used, mixed well and reacted for 2 h. 5 \u00b5L of ADP Detection was added, centrifuged and mixed well. Then the full wavelength value was read from Envision multifunctional plate reader.\nTable 1.

The logarithmic value of the concentration was plotted against the activity percentage, and then a non-linear regression was used to calculate the fitted curve. The software GraphPad Prism 8.0 (formula log(inhibitor) vs. response -- Variable slope) was used to fit the curve and calculate the IC<sub>50</sub> value, and the results are shown in the table below.\nTable 2.

To further evaluate the functional changes induced by the inhibition of ACLY by the tested compounds, the inventors isolated primary mouse hepatocytes and evaluated the ability of the de novo synthesis of lipids using [1,2-<sup>14</sup>C]-sodium acetate as a substrate tracer, while compound ETC-1002 was used as a positive control.</p>Test protocol:Primary hepatic cell isolation and walling: the mouse liver was lavaged by calcium-free perfusate, then digested using collagenase and mouse primary hepatocytes were obtained by density gradient centrifugation, and were inoculated in 6-w"
