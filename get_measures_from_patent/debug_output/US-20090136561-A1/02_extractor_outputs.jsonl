{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n* Hence, the binding constant between 14-3-3 gamma and the minimal consensus sequence was lower than that for the original pHSP20 peptide sequence (K\u209c\u22486 nM, as determined by a Biacore experiment).\n* For the E25-YWHAG a K\u209c of 25 nM to 1.3 \u03bcM was determined in several experiments\n* For the E23-YWAG a much tighter K\u209c of 5-50 nM was determined in several experiments.\n* The kinetics for the pHSP20/14-3-3\u03b3 interaction may be in the high nM range"}
