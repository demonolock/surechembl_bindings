    "d from the various controls, were merged and used as a background subtraction list for the pHSP20 peptide pull-down. Only the proteins that remained after subtraction are reported in the results. Generally, proteins that have been identified from multiple peptides and have a Mascot protein score above 100 are considered confidently identified results.</p>EXAMPLE 2Determination of the Binding Between Various Truncated Versions of the pHSP20 (Phosphorylated HSP20) Peptide and the 14-3-3 Gamma IsoformTo determine the relative binding affinity between various truncated versions of the pHSP20 (phosphorylated HSP20) peptide and the 14-3-3 gamma isoform, Applicants employed Biacore binding assays and the experiments were set up as follows. The pHSP20 peptide used in the original experiments (e.g., WLRRApSAPLPGLSK) was immobilized to a Biacore chip and competition experiments were performed by flowing a 14-3-3 gamma isoform protein over the chip in the presence of different pHSP20 truncation variants. The pHSP20 truncation variants included: a) pHSP20 (positive control); b) HSP20 (unphosphorylated pHSP20, negative control); c) RRApSAP (minimal 14-3-3 consensus binding sequence); d) WLRRApSAP; e) RRApSAPLP; f) RRApSAPLPGLS; g) WLRRApSAPLP.</p>Competition experiments were done whereby the only variable between experiments is the identity of the competing peptide. Hence, the relative ability of each peptide to compete with the original pHSP20 peptide should correlate inversely with the binding constant of each peptide for 14-3-3 gamma.</p>The results are shown in FIGS. 3-6. The minimal consensus 14-3-3\u03b3-binding sequence was RRApSAP and it competed better than the original pHSP20 sequence (WLRRApSAPLPGLSK) for binding to 14-3-3\u03b3. Hence, the binding constant between 14-3-3 gamma and the minimal consensus sequence was lower than that for the original pHSP20 peptide sequence (K<sub>D</sub>\u22486 nM, as determined by a Biacore experiment). In addition, this tight binding of the 14-3-3\u03b3-binding consensus sequence to pHSP20 was unaffected by additional N-terminal residues (WL-) but was severely reduced by additional C-terminal residues (e.g., -LP or -LPGLS). However, this negative effect of the C-terminal residues was eliminated if the N-terminal residues were added back. This data suggests that a fluorophore can be added to the N-terminus of a peptide when used for Fluorescence Polarization experiments.</p>Taken together, the peptides RRApSAP and WLRRApSAP represent peptides which have a higher binding affinity to 14-3-3 gamma than the original pHSP20 peptide does. It remains to be determined what specificity each peptide has for the various 14-3-3 isoform. It may be that the selectivity of binding with the 14-3-3 gamma isoform is encoded in the amino acids that flank the minimal consensus binding sequence.</p>EXAMPLE 3Determination of the Binding Between the pHSP20 Peptide and Various Versions and Isoforms of the 14-3-3To further determine binding specificity of the pHSP20 peptide for each 14-3-3 isoform, similar binding experiments were carried out with each 14-3-3 isoform. Various 14-3-3 isoforms were either tagged with GST-His (referred to as \u201cE23\u201d) or tagged with Biotin-His (referred to as \u201cE25\u201d). These E23-tagged or E25-tagged 14-3-3 proteins were used in the Biacore experiments shown in FIGS. 2, 3, 4, 7 and 8. The E23-14-3-3 proteins (tagged with GST-His) bound much better than the E25-14-3-3 proteins (tagged with Biotin-His). Similar effects were detected by using a version of YWHAG (also referred to as 14-3-3\u03b3) in which the GST tag was proteolytically removed. However, both tag-systems showed the same isoform specificity for the pHSP20 peptide (YWHAG&gt;YWHAH&gt;YWHAE=YWAHB=YWHAZ). It is believed that the GST either has a chaperone or stabilizing effect on YWHAG or it promotes the formation of dimers of YWHAG which could have different binding properties to pHSP20. Further experiments are planned to elucidate this discrepancy.</p>To determine the binding constant for the pHSP20 peptide, the E23 and E25-14-3-3 proteins were used in the Biacore experiments. For the E25-YWHAG a K<sub>d </sub>of 25 nM to 1.3 \u03bcM was determined in several experiments However, due to the low signal of the E25-YWHAG compared to E23-YWHAG the quality of the fit is not as good and it is therefore not surprising that the estimated K<sub>d </sub>varies so much. For the E23-YWAG a much tighter K<sub>d </sub>of 5-50 nM was determined in several experiments. Certain experimental conditions could alter the absolute value of the K<sub>d</sub>. For example, a high immobilization level of peptide on the chip can cause rebinding effects. Therefore, the kinetics for the pHSP20/14-3-3\u03b3 interaction may be in the high nM range</p>In sum, one of the goals of these studies is to find the minimal peptide that not only binds as well or better than the original pHSP20 peptide sequence, but also has binding specificity for a specific isoform of the 14-3-3 (e.g., the 14-3-3 gamma isoform). Moreover, similar binding experiments can be carried out to determine the binding constant using the Biacore instrument. These experiments can be used to confirm the implied relative affinities determined from the competition experiments as described above in Example 2.</p>EXAMPLE 4Dose Response for Compounds Represented by General Formula I in Fluorescence Polarization AssayThe ability of compounds (a)-(k) to inhibit the interaction between 14-3-3\u03b3 and pHSP20 was determined by a fluorescence polarization (FP) assay. Fluorescence Polarization measurements were made on samples arrayed in black 384-well plates (Greiner Bio-One) by using an Envision plate reader (Perkin-Elmer; excitation wavelength 480 nm and observed emission wavelength 535 nm) to monitor the interaction between the 14-3-3 gamma protein and an N-terminal 6-carboxy-fluorescein-labeled pHSP20 peptide with the amino acid sequence WLRRApSAP. The initial screen for inhibitors examined approximately 50,000 compounds in the DiverSet library (ChemBridge, San Diego). Initial compound screening was carried out by first mixing peptide and individual compounds followed by addition of protein to a final volume of 15 ul. The final concentrations of each component were: 57.4 nM peptide, 10 uM compound, 5% DMSO, 1.5 uM 14-3-3 gamma, 0.01 M HEPES pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% Tween 20, 10 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, 9.33 mM Tris (7.5), and 0.0093% NaN<sub>3</sub>. Several of the compounds, particularly (a), (f) and (j) were able to largely inhibit interaction between 14-3-3\u03b3 and pHSP20 in a dose-re"
