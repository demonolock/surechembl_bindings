    "protein vs. 25 \u00b1 4 pmol GLP- 1 / mg protein) . This demonstrates again that the fermentable fiber diet increases GLP-1 concentrations in the tested animals.</p>Histology. Dietary effects on intestinal villi heights and crypt depths are presented in Fig. 4. Duodenal villi heights tended to be higher in dogs fed the HFF diet compared to those fed the LFF diet (1505 \u00b1 83 vs 1294 \u00b1 83 \u03bcm, p = 0.1) but there were no differences in duodenal crypt depths (289 \u00b1</p>28 vs 262 + 28 urn) . Jejunal villi heights were significantly higher in dogs fed the HFF vs LFF diets (1517 + 43 vs 1343 \u00b1 43 \u03bcm, respectively) but no significant differences were found in crypt depths (277 \u00b1 19 vs 234 \u00b1 19 \u03bcm) . Ileal villi heights and crypt depths were not significantly different between dogs fed the HFF vs. LFF diet (1035 \u00b1 45 vs 993 + 45 \u03bcm and 251 \u00b1 46 \n\nvs 357 \u00b1 46 \u03bcm, respectively) . Colonic crypt depths were not significantly different (724 + 33 vs 727 + 33 \u03bcm) between dogs fed the HFF vs LFF diet, respectively.</p>Nutrient uptake . The effect of dietary fiber fermentability on nutrient uptake is shown in Table 2.</p>Consumption of HFF resulted in a significantly higher maximum glucose uptake capacity (Vmax) for D-glucose in the jejunum (see, Fig. 5) . A significant diet effect was also noted in fatty acid- 12 uptake in the jejunum, a measure of unstirred water layer resistance. The Michaelis affinity constant (Km) was not affected by diet. The estimation of paracellular D- glucose uptake, or the Kd for D-glucose as determined by extrapolation of L-glucose uptakes at 16 mM through the origin and normalizing to 1 mM, was not significantly affected by diet. Kd for D- fructose was not affected by diet.</p>Glucose Transporters . Diet did not affect SGLT-1 mRNA in any of the intestinal segments measured (see, Fig. 6) . The consumption of HFF vs. LFF diet was associated with higher jejunal SGLT-1 transporter protein abundance (22.2 \u00b1 3.7 vs 6.6 + 3.7 densitometer units) . SGLT-1 transporter protein abundance tended to be higher in the ileum when HFF diet was consumed (13.4 \u00b1 0.7 vs 10.4 \u00b1 0.7 densitometer units, p = 0.09, see, Fig. 7) . Significant differences due to diet were seen in both jejunal and ileal GLUT2 transporter protein abundance (see, Fig. 8), showing an increase with consumption of HFF vs. LFF diet (1.9 \u00b1 0.2 vs. 0.9 \u00b1 0.1 densitometer units and 4.2 \u00b1 0.2 vs. 1.5 + 0.2 densitometer units, respectively) . \n\n</p>Table 1</p>Composition of experimental diets Low-Fermentable Fiber High Fermentable Fiber</p>Ingredient (LFF) (HFF) (g/kg diet as fed)</p>poultry by-product meal 460 460 poultry fat 164 164 fishmeal 122 121 pre-gelled cornstarch 80 110</p>Menhaden oil 3 3 dried whole egg 40 40</p>Chicken digest 25 25 vitamin premix 3.2 3.2 mineral premix 2.4 2.4 cellulose 70 beet pulp 60 gum arabic 20 fructooligosaccharides 15 Potassium chloride 2.2 2.1</p>Calcium chloride 1.9 1.1</p>Choline chloride 1.1</p>Sodium chloride 0.3 0.3 \n\n</p>Table 2</p>Intestinal transport rates in dogs fed highly- fermentable fiber (HFF) versus lowly- fermentable fiber (LFF) diets for 14 days</p>Jejunum Ileum HFF LFF HFF LFF</p>D-glucose<sup>1</sup></p>Vmax 182\u00b115<sup>a</sup> 133\u00b1l3 132\u00b111 146\u00b115</p>(nmol/mg tissue/min) Km (mM) 10.0+1.9 8.0+2.0 5.5+1.2 12.7\u00b12.2 L-crlucose (nmol/mcr tissue/min) at 16mM 21.7+1.2 21.5\u00b13.3 33.7\u00b15.3 27.8\u00b13.5 at 1 mM 1.4\u00b10.1 1.4+0.2 2.1\u00b10.3 1.4+0.2</p>D- fructose (nmol/mg tissue/min) Kd<sup>2</sup> 1.96 1.61 2.43 2.28</p>Fatty acid 12 uptake^ (nmol/mg tissue/min) 2.4\u00b10.2<sup>a</sup> 1.7\u00b10.2<sup>b</sup> 3.6\u00b10.5 4.2\u00b10.2</p><sup>1</sup> Values are means + SEM, n = 8 per diet.

Cellulose, which is minimally degraded during passage through the canine gastrointestinal tract (GIT) , was added to the control diet (A) at a level of 3.6%. The second diet (B) contained beet pulp (4.2%) and fructooligosaccharides (FOS) (1%), which are fermented by the GIT bacteria of dogs. Chemical analyses showed both diets had 25.9% protein, 11.8% \n\nfat, with 6.2% moisture-, 5.7% ash, 1.23% calcium, and 0.79% phosphorus . Diet B used a blend of beet pulp and FOS because differences in their rates of fiber fermentation by the intestinal bacteria of dogs. The products of bacterial metabolism of FOS, such as SCFA, should be available more proximally in the GIT compared to those from beet pulp, which is fermented slower. Furthermore, the two sources of fermentable fiber are designed to yield different concentrations and proportions of SCFA. The cellulose (Solka Floe) was obtained from Fiber and Sales Development Corporation (St. Louis, MO), the beet pulp from Michigan Sugar (Saginaw, MI) , and FOS from Golden Technologies Company (Golden, CO) .</p>Table 3</p>Ingredient Portion of Diet, wt % corn grits to 100 chicken and chicken by-product meal 23.4 brewers rice 15"
