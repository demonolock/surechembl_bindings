    ">2</sub> Fragments(a) Conjugation of the Murine LL2 F(ab')<sub>2</sub> Fragment with Chelator</p>LL2 is a murine monoclonal antibody that has been shown to be effective for the diagnosis and treatment of non-Hodgkins B-cell lymphoma. Goldenberg et al., J. Clin. Oncol. 9:548-564 (1991); Murthy et al., Eur. J. Nucl. Med. 19:394-401 (1992); The LL2 F(ab')<sub>2</sub> fragment was conjugated with either aminobenzyl DTPA (DTPA) or a derivative of DTPA containing the long-chain linker, --CSNH(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>10</sub> NH<sub>2</sub> (LC-DTPA). Briefly, LL2 F(ab')<sub>2</sub> fragment (2.5 mg) in about 1 ml of 50 mM acetate-buffered 0.9% saline (ABS; pH 5.3) was oxidized in the dark by treatment with sodium metaperiodate (210 \u03bcl of a 5.68 mg/ml solution) at 0\u00b0 C. for one hour. The reaction mixture was treated with ethylene glycol (20 \u03bcl) to decompose the unreacted periodate and the oxidized antibody fragment was purified using a Sephadex G-50/80 column (Pharmacia; Piscataway, N.J.) equilibrated in PBS (pH 6.1). The oxidized fragment was then reacted with excess DTPA or LC-DTPA. After 40 hours at room temperature, the Schiff base was reduced by NaBH<sub>3</sub> CN. Conjugated antibody was purified using a centrifuged size-exclusion column (Sephadex G-50/80) equilibrated in 0.1M acetate (pH 6.5). The concentrations of antibody conjugates were determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm.</p>The ratio of chelator molecules per molecule of antibody fragment was determined by a metal-binding assay. The assay was performed by mixing an aliquot of LL2 F(ab')<sub>2</sub> -chelator conjugate with 0.1M ammonium acetate (pH 7) and 2M triethanolamine, and incubating the mixture at room temperature with a known excess of cobalt acetate spiked with <sup>57</sup> cobalt acetate. After 30 minutes, EDTA (pH 7) was added to a final concentration of 10 mM. After a further 10 minute incubation, the mixture was analyzed by instant thin layer chromatography (ITLC) using 10mMEDTA for development. The fraction of radioactivity bound to antibody was determined by counting sections of ITLC strips on a gamma counter. The results indicated that there were about 6 molecules of DTPA per antibody fragment and about 5 molecules of LC-DTPA per antibody fragment.</p>(b) Determination of the Immunoreactivity of LL2 F(ab')<sub>2</sub> -chelator Conjugates</p>The immunoreactivities of the LL2 F(ab')<sub>2</sub> -DTPA and LL2 F(ab')<sub>2</sub> -LC-DTPA conjugates were determined using an ELISA assay. The results demonstrated that LL2 F(ab')<sub>2</sub> and the DTPA and LC-DTPA conjugates exhibited similar binding activity toward an LL2 anti-idiotype antibody.</p>In addition, the immunoreactivities of the LL2 F(ab')<sub>2</sub> -DTPA and LL2 F(ab')<sub>2</sub> -LC-DTPA conjugates were examined in a binding competition assay. In these experiments, a human chimeric LL2 (IgG/kappa) was used to compete with LL2 F(ab')<sub>2</sub> or its conjugates for binding to Raji lymphoma cells (ATCC CCL",
    "Yttrium-labeled LL2 F(ab')<sub>2</sub> -DTPA was prepared by mixing <sup>90</sup> yttrium acetate (128.7 \u03bcCi) with LL2 F(ab')<sub>2</sub> -DTPA (30 \u03bcg; 8.3 \u03bcl), incubating at room temperature for one hour, and diluting with 90 \u03bcl of 0.1M acetate (pH 6.5). <sup>90</sup> Yttrium-labeled LL2 F(ab')<sub>2</sub> -LC-DTPA was prepared by mixing <sup>90</sup> yttrium acetate (109.5 \u03bcCi) with LL2 F(ab')<sub>2</sub> -LC-DTPA (30 \u03bcg; 7.6 \u03bcl), incubating at room temperature for one hour, and diluting with 90 \u03bcl of 0.1M acetate (pH 6.5). The result of the labeling procedure was tested by ITLC in two solvent systems, and by HPLC, as described above.</p><sup>90</sup> Yttrium-labeled LL2 F(ab')<sub>2</sub> -DTPA had a specific activity of 4.29 \u03bcCi/\u03bcg protein, while <sup>90</sup> yttrium-labeled LL2 F(ab')<sub>2</sub> -LC-DTPA had a specific activity of 3.65 \u03bcCi/\u03bcg protein. Radio-HPLC analysis indicated that <sup>90</sup> yttrium was incorporated in LL2 F(ab')<sub>2</sub> -DTPA by 96%, while <sup>90</sup> yttrium was incorporated in LL2 F(ab')<sub>2</sub> -LC-DTPA by 90%.</p>EXAMPLE 4Indirect Conjugation at the Carbohydrate Moiety of the FR1 Region of the Light Chain Variable Domain of F(ab')<sub>2</sub> Fragments(a) Preparation of the Intermediate Conjugate</p>The murine LL2 F(ab')<sub>2</sub> fragment was conjugated with doxorubicin via dextran, using the method of Shih et al., Int. J. Cancer 41:832-839 (1988). Briefly, amino dextran was prepared by dissolving one gram of dextran (m.w. 18 kD; Sigma Chemical Co.; St. Louis, Mo.) in 70 ml of water. The dextran was partially oxidized to form polyaldehyde dextran by adding 0.5 gram of sodium metaperiodate, and stirring the solution at room temperature overnight. After concentrating the mixture with an Amicon cell (YM10 membrane; MWCO=10,000), the polyaldehyde dextran was purified by Sephadex G-25 chromatography and lyophilized to give about 900 grams of white powder. Polyaldehyde dextran was then treated with two equivalents of 1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane in aqueous phase for 24 hours at room temperature. The resultant Schiff base was stabilized by addition of sodium borohydride (0.311 mmol per 2.15 mmol of 1,3-diamino-2-hydroxypropane) to the mixture. The mixture was allowed to incubate at room temperature for six hours. Amino dextran was purified using a Sephadex G-25 column.</p>Doxorubicin (Sigma Chemical Co.; St. Louis, Mo.) was activated by adding one milliliter of anhydrous DMF to 0.1 mmole of doxorubicin in a dried Reacti-vial, followed by a solution of N-hydroxysuccinimide (23 mg, 0.2 mmole; Sigma) in 750 \u03bcl of anhydrous DMF and a solution of 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (41.5 mg, 0.2 mmol; Sigma) in 750 \u03bcl of anhydrous DMF. The reaction mixture was stirred in the dark at room temperature for 16 hours under anhydrous conditions. The side product, i.e., the urea derivative, did not precipitate well in this solvent system. The precipitate was centrifuged and the solution was stored in a sealed bottle at -20\u00b0 C.</p>Doxorubicin-dextran intermediate conjugate was prepared by dissolving aminodextran (18 kD; 10 mg) in two milliliters of PBS (pH 7.2) and gradually adding 0.7 ml of the above N-hydroxy-succinimide-activated doxorubicin solution. Thus, 50 moles of doxorubicin were present per mole of aminodextran. The solution was stirred at room temperature for five hours and after removing any precipitate, the conjugate was purified using a Sephadex G-25 column. Doxorubicin-dextran conjugate was characterized by a doxorubicin/dextran ratio of 14.</p>Alternatively, doxorubicin-dextran conjugate was prepared by reacting doxorubicin with 1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, as described by Shih et al., Int. J. Cancer 41:832-839 (1988). Also, see Shih et al., Cancer Research 51:4192-4198 (1991).</p>EXAMPLE 5Introduction of an Asn-linked Glycosylation Site in the VK FR1 Region of Humanized MN14An Asn-glycosylation site was introduced into the VK FR1 region of humanized MN14, which is an antibody that binds carcinoembryonic antigen. Briefly, the nucleotide sequence encoding Arg<sub>18</sub> was mutated to a nucleotide sequence encoding Asn<sub>18</sub> using the PCR method described in Example 1. In this case, DNA from the light chain expression vector for humanized MN14 was used as a template for PCR. The VKFOR1 primer of Orlandi et al. was used as the 3' primer. The 5' primer consisted of a 57-mer encoding the first 20 amino acids of the MN14 VK domain, with the exception that the codon at position 18 encoded Asn. The approximately 300 base pair PCR product was digested wi"
