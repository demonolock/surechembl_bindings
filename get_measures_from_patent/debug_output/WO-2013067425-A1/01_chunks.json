    "d using L2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. After 24h the transfected cells were split into 10 cm tissue culture plates and grown for 1 day after which the medium was replaced with fresh growth medium containing G418 (Gibco) at 0.5 mg/ml final concentration. Drug-resistant colonies were selected after approximately 8 days and then tested for <sup>14</sup>C-uric acid transport activity. The HEK293/ URAT1 -model cells are plated on Poly-D-Lysine Coated 96-well Plates at a density of 125,000 cells per well. </p> [00176] Cells were grown overnight (20-26 hours) at 37\u00b0C in an incubator. Plates were allowed to come to room temperature and media was washed out with one wash of 250 \u03bc\u0390 of Wash Buffer (125mM Na Gluconate, 10 mM Hepes ph 7.3). 2-((3-(4-cyanonaphthalen-l-yl)pyridin-4- yl)thio)-2-methylpropanoic acid or vehicle is added in assay buffer with <sup>14</sup>C-uric acid for a final concentration of 125\u03bc\u039c Uric Acid with a specific activity of 54 mCi/mmol. Assay Buffer is 125mM Sodium Gluconate, 4.8mM Potassium Gluconate, 1.2 mM Potassium phosphate, monobasic, 1.2mM magnesium sulfate, 1.3mM Ca Gluconate, 5.6mM Glucose, 25mM HEPES, pH 7.3. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes then washed 3 times with 50\u03bc1 Wash Buffer and 3 times with 250\u03bc1 Wash Buffer. Microscint 20 Scintillation Fluid was added and plates were incubated overnight at room temperature to equilibrate. Plates are then read on the TopCount Plate Reader and an EC50 value generated.

Chem., 2004, 279, 45942-45950.) </p>[00177] 2-((3-(4-cyanonaphthalen-l-yl)pyridin-4-yl)thio)-2-methylpropanoic acid was tested according to the protocol described above against URAT-1 model. 2-((3-(4-cyanonaphthalen-l- yl)pyridin-4-yl)thio)-2-methylpropanoic acid has an EC50 value &lt; 0.05 \u03bc\u039c. \n\n Example 3: Single-Dose Phase I Clinical Trial </p> [00178] 2-((3-(4-cyanonaphthalen-l-yl)pyridin-4-yl)thio)-2-methylpropanoic acid was investigated according to the clinical trial described below. </p> Study </p> [00179] A Phase 1, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary Food Effect of Single Doses of a URAT1 Inhibitor, in Healthy Adult Male Volunteers. </p>Objectives </p> [00180] To assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and uricosuric effects after oral administration as single doses of a tablet formulation and the effect of food on bioavailability. Investigational Plan/Study Design </p> [00181] Subjects receive a single, oral dose of active or placebo, at the following doses: </p>Group 1 : 2mg (fasted); </p>Group 2: 5mg (fasted); </p>Group 3: 5mg (fed); </p> Group 4: 20mg (fasted) [sentinel dosing]; </p> Group 5: 20mg (fed); </p> Group 6: 40mg (fasted) </p> Study Details </p> Subjects </p> [00182] 48 subjects in 6 dose groups, 8 subjects/group, are randomized 3: 1 to receive active (6/group) or placebo (2/group). All study procedures are the same regardless of whether subject receives active or placebo. The total duration of subject participation, including screening period, is -2-4 weeks, and the total volume of blood collected from each subject during the entire study &lt;500mL, (less than typically collected during a volunteer blood donation). </p>Study Medic"
