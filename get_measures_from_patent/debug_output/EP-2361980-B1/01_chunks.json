    "tides spontaneously associate, the IRP/MC complex can be formed by simple co-administration of the polynucleotide and the MC. Microspheres may be characterized for size and surface charge before and after polynucleotide association. Selected batches may then evaluated for activity against suitable controls in, for example, human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and mouse splenocyte assays. The formulations may also evaluated in suitable animal models.</p>Non-covalent IRP/MC complexes linked by nucleotide base pairing may be produced using conventional methodologies. Generally, base-paired IRP/MC complexes are produced using a microcarrier comprising a bound, preferably a covalently bound, polynucleotide (the \"capture polynucleotide\") that is at least partially complementary to the IRP. The segment of complementarity between the IRP and the capture nucleotide is preferably at least 6, 8, 10 or 15 contiguous base pairs, more preferably at least 20 contiguous base pairs. The capture nucleotide may be bound to the MC by any method known in the art, and is preferably covalently bound to the IRP at the 5' or 3' end. In some variations, an IRP comprising a 5'-GGGG-3' sequence will retain this portion of the sequence as single-stranded.</p>In other variations, a binding pair may be used to link the IRP and MC in an IRP/MC complex. The binding pair may be a receptor and ligand, an antibody and antigen (or epitope), or any other binding pair which binds at high affinity (e.g., Kd less than about 10-8). One type of preferred binding pair is biotin and streptavidin or biotin and avidin, which form very tight complexes. When using a binding pair to mediate IRP/MC complex binding, the IRP is derivatized, typically by a covalent linkage, with one member of the binding pair, and the MC is derivatized with the other member of the binding pair. Mixture of the two derivatized compounds results in IRP/MC complex formation.</p>Isolation and Synthesis of Immunoregulatory PolynucleotidesDescribed herein are also methods of making the immunoregulatory polynucleotides described herein. In some variations, the immunoregulatory polynucleotides comprise modified immunoregulatory sequences. In some variations, the immunoregulatory polynucleotides comprise unmodified immunoregulatory sequences. The methods may be any of those described herein. For example, the method could be synthesizing the IRP (for example, using solid state synthesis) and may further comprise any purification step(s). Methods of purification are known in the art.</p>Also described are methods for isolating and synthesizing immunoregulatory polynucleotide (IRP). In some variations, the IRP is a modified IRP. In some variations, the IRP is an unmodified IRP.</p>The IRP can be synthesized using techniques and nucleic acid synthesis equipment which are well known in the art including, but not limited to, enzymatic methods, chemical methods, and the degradation of larger oligonucleotide sequences.
