    "eic acid sequences, host cells transformed with such recombinant expression vectors, recombinant polypeptides and derivatives coded for by said nucleic acid sequences which recombinant polypeptides and derivatives do have biological activities together with prolonged in vivo half-life and/or improved in vivo recovery compared to the unmodified wild-type protein. The invention also relates to corresponding FVIII sequences that result in improved expression yield. The present invention further relates to processes for the manufacture of such recombinant proteins and their derivatives. The invention also relates to a transfer vector for use in human gene therapy, which comprises such modified nucleic acid sequences.</p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION There are various bleeding disorders caused by deficiencies of blood coagulation factors. The most common disorders are hemophilia A and B, resulting from deficiencies of blood coagulation factor VIII and IX, respectively. Another known bleeding disorder is von Willebrand's disease.</p>In plasma FVIII exists mostly as a noncovalent complex with VWF and its coagulant function is to accelerate factor IXa dependent conversion of factor X to Xa Due to the complex formation of FVIII and VWF it was assumed for a long time that FVIII and VWF functions are two functions of the same molecule. Only in the seventies it became clear that FVIII and VWF are separate molecules that form a complex under physiologic conditions. In the eighties then the dissociation constant of about 0.2 nmol/L was determined (Leyte et al., Biochem J 1989, 257: 679-683) and the DNA sequence of both molecules was studied.</p>Classic hemophilia or hemophilia A is an inherited bleeding disorder. It results from a chromosome X-linked deficiency of blood coagulation FVIII, and affects almost exclusively males with an incidence of between one and two individuals per 10,000. The X-chromosome defect is transmitted by female carriers who are not themselves hemophiliacs. The clinical manifestation of hemophilia A is an increased bleeding tendency. Before treatment with FVIII concentrates was introduced the mean life span for a person with severe hemophilia was less than 20 years. The use of concentrates of FVIII from plasma has considerably improved the situation for the hemophilia A patients increasing the mean life span extensively, giving most of them the possibility to live a more or less normal life. However, there have been certain problems with the plasma derived concentrates and their use, the most serious of which have been the transmission of viruses. So far, viruses causing hepatitis B, non-A non-B hepatitis and AIDS have hit the population seriously. Since then different virus inactivation methods and new highly purified FVIII concentrates have recently been developed which established a very high safety standard also for plasma derived FVIII.</p>The cloning of the cDNA for FVIII (Wood et al. 1984. Nature 312:330-336; Vehar et al. 1984. Na",
    "secretion, reduced ER chaperone interaction, improved ER-Golgi transport, increased activation or resistance to inactivation and improved half-life (summarized by Pipe 2004. Sem. Thromb. Hemost. 30:227-237). All of these FVIII mutants and variants are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>VWF may be processed proteolytically at various stages. For example, as mentioned supra, the protease ADAMTS13 cleaves VWF within the A2 domain of VWF. Accordingly, the present invention encompasses also modified VWF which has been cleaved proteolytically e.g. by ADAMTS13. Such cleavage would result in multimeric chains of VWF which comprise at their ends at least one or at most two monomers of VWF which have been cleaved by ADAMTS 13.</p>Preferably N-VWF-C comprises the full length sequence of VWF. Also encompassed are N-terminal, C-terminal or internal deletions of VWF as long as the biological activity of VWF is retained. The biological activity is retained in the sense of the invention if the VWF with deletions retains at least 10%, preferably at least 25%, more preferably at least 50%, most preferably at least 75% of the biological activity of wild-type VWF. The biological activity of wild-type VWF can be determined by the artisan using methods for ristocetin co-factor activity (Federici A B et al. 2004. Haematologica 89:77-85), binding of VWF to GP Ib\u03b1 of the platelet glycoprotein complex Ib-V-IX (Sucker et al. 2006. Clin Appl Thromb Hemost. 12:305-310), or a collagen binding assay (Kailas &amp; Talpsep. 2001. Annals of Hematology 80:466-471).</p>\u201cFVIII\u201d and/or \u201cVWF\u201d within the above definition also include natural allelic variations that may exist and occur from one individual to another. \u201cFVIII\u201d and/or \u201cVWF\u201d within the above definition further includes variants of FVIII and or VWF. Such variants differ in one or more amino acid residues from the wild-type sequence. Examples of such differences may include as conservative amino acid substitutions, i.e. substitutions within groups of amino acids with similar characteristics, e.g. (1) small amino acids, (2) acidic amino acids, (3) polar amino acids, (4) basic amino acids, (5) hydrophobic amino acids, and (6) aromatic amino acids. Examples of such conservative substitutions are shown in the following table.</p>TABLE 1(1)AlanineGlycine(2)Aspartic acidGlutamic acid(3)AsparagineGlutamineSerineThreonine(4)ArginineHistidineLysine(5)IsoleucineLeucineMethionineValine(6)PhenylalanineTyrosineTryptophane</p>One or more HLEPs may fused to the C-terminal part of FVIII preferably as not to interfere with the binding capabilities of FVIII for example to VWF, platelets or FIX.</p>One or more HLEPs may be fused to the C-terminal part of VWF preferably as not to interfere with the binding capabilities of VWF for example to FVIII, platelets, heparin or collagen.</p>Once FVIII is endogenously activated during coagulation in vivo, it may be no longer desirable to maintain the increased functional half-life of t"
