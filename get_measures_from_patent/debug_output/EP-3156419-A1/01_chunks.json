    "ge display, or chain shuffling. Affinity and specificity can be modified or improved by mutating CDR and/or FW residues and screening for antigen binding sites having the desired characteristics (see e.g., Yang et al., J. Mol. Biol., 254: 392-403(1995)). CDRs are mutated in a variety of ways. One way is to randomize individual residues, or combinations of residues, so that in a population of, otherwise identical antigen binding sites, subsets of from two to twenty amino acids are found at particular positions. Alternatively, mutations can be induced over a range of residues by error prone PCR methods (see e.g., Hawkins et al., J. Mol. Biol., 226: 889-96 (1992)). In another example, phage display vectors containing heavy and light chain variable region genes can be propagated in mutator strains of E. coli (see e.g., Low et al., J. Mol. Biol., 250: 359-68 (1996)). These methods of mutagenesis are illustrative of the many methods known to one of skill in the art.</p>A convenient way for generating substitutional variants is affinity maturation using phage display. Briefly, several CDR region sites are mutated to generate all possible amino acid substitutions at each site. The antibody variants thus generated are displayed in a monovalent fashion from filamentous phage particles as fusions to the gene III product of M13 packaged within each particle. The phage-displayed variants are then screened for their biological activity (e.g., binding affinity (K<sub>D</sub>), specificity, EC50) as herein disclosed. In order to identify candidate CDR region sites for modification, alanine scanning mutagenesis can be performed to identify CDR region residues contributing significantly to antigen binding. Alternatively, or in addition, random mutagenesis may be performed on one or more CDR sequences at one or more residue positions, either while the CDR is operably linked to the variable region or while the CDR is independent of other variable region sequence and then the altered CDR returned to a variable region using recombinant DNA technology. Once such variant antibodies are generated and expressed, the panel of variants is subjected to screening as described herein, and antibodies with superior properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further development.</p>In addition to the antibodies specifically described herein, other \"substantially homologous\" modified antibodies can be readily designed and manufactured utilizing various recombinant DNA techniques well known to those skilled in the art. For example, the framework regions can vary from the native sequences at the primary structure level by several amino acid substitutions, terminal and intermediate additions and deletions, and the like. Moreover, a variety of different human framework regions may be used singly or in combination as a basis for the humanized immunoglobulins of the present invention. In general, modifications of the genes may be readily accomplished by a variety of w",

To establish a stable cell line, co-transfect in a suitable host cell line, such as NSO or CHO cells, with linearized heavy and light chain plasmids by electroporation and culture in suitable media such as glutamine free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium with dialyzed fetal calf serum and glutamine synthetase supplement. Screen clones for antibody expression by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and select the highest producer for culture in spinner flasks.

Chimera 2 to chimera 7 are as follows: m,m,h (chimera 2), m,m,m (chimera 3), h,m,h (chimera 4), h,m,m (chimera 5), h,h,m (chimera 6) and m,h,m (chimera 7) fused to the last two Ig domains of human CSF-1R and then the Fc tag.</p>Antibody 1 binding to the chimeric CSF-1R proteins is determined by binding ELISAs and Biacore\u00ae as described above. Briefly, coat plates with 100 \u00b5L of 200 ng/mL human, mouse or chimera 1-7 proteins overnight. After washing and blocking the plates, add Antibody 1 in replicates at 100 nM concentration. Add anti-human Fab secondary antibodies conjugated to HRP at a concentration of 1:10,000 to detect Antibody 1 binding to the CSF-1R molecules.</p>As expected, Antibody 1 binds to the human but not mouse CSF-1R in the ELISA binding assays. Antibody 1 binds weakly to chimeras containing the first or second human Ig domains, but not those that contain the first or second mouse Ig domain. Antibody 1 binds strongly to the chimera that contains both the first and second Ig domain of human CSF-1R. All other constructs do not bind Antibody 1. Therefore, Antibody 1 binds to Ig domains one and two, but requires both domains for strong antibody binding to human CSF-1R when evaluated in a binding assay. Biacore\u00ae data recapitulates the ELISA data. Any chimeric construct that did not contain a human second Ig domain did not bind Antibody 1 even when antibody levels were at 1 \u00b5M, indicating that the second Ig domain is required for Antibody 1 binding. Antibody 1 binding was further enhanced when the first Ig domain was also of human origin. Therefore, Antibody 1 primarily binds to the second Ig domain of CSF-1R but has some beneficial contacts with the first Ig domain.</p>Differentiation and Proliferation AssaysMacrophage Differentiation by CSF-1Seed monocytes (Lonza) at a density of 4x10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL in each chamber of an 8-chamber slide in 900 \u00b5L Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 media containing 10% FBS and 100 ng/mL hCSF-1. Make serial dilutions of Antibody 1 in RPMI (starting at 1 \u00b5g/mL and diluting 3-fold) and add 100 \u00b5L to the wells. Incubate at 37\u00b0C, changing media every three days until monocytes are visibly seen to adhere to the plate and elongate, which is characteristic of macrophage differentiation.</p>Monocytes treated with 2 nM or higher concentrations of Antibody 1 in the presence of CSF-1 fail to differentiate into macrophages, retaining their rounded morphology characteristic of monocytes. CSF-1 induction of monocyte to macrophage differentiation can be inhibited with Antibody 1 with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.25 nM. In addition, many die during treatment, unable to survive without continual stimulation with CSF-1.</p>Macrophage D"
