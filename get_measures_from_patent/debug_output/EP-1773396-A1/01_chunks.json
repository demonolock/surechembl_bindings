The PGE2 formed is measured by standard ELISA technology (Cayman Chemical).</p>\n  Step 3: Fast assay for COX-1 and COX-2 activity.</p>\n  [000149] COX activity is assayed as PGE2 formed/microgram protein/time using an ELISA to detect the prostaglandin released. CHAPS-solubilized insect cell membranes containing the appropriate COX enzyme are incubated in a potassium phosphate buffer (0.05 M Potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 2 micromolar phenol, 1 micromolar heme, 300 micromolar epinephrine) with the addition of 20 microliters of 100 micromolar arachidonic acid (10 micromolar). Compounds are pre-incubated with the enzyme for 10 minutes at 25\u00b0C prior to the addition of arachidonic acid. Any reaction between the arachidonic acid and the enzyme is stopped after two minutes at 37\u00b0C/room temperature by transferring 40 microliters of reaction mix into 160 microliters ELISA buffer and 25 micromolar indomethacin. The PGE2 formed is measured by standard ELISA technology (Cayman Chemical).</p>\n  EXAMPLE 2. LTB<sub>4</sub> Receptor Antagonist Activity.</p>\n  [000150] The LTB<sub>4</sub> activity of the compounds of the invention may be determined by comparing the ability of the compounds of the invention to compete with radiolabeled LTB<sub>4</sub> for specific LTB<sub>4</sub> receptor sites on guinea pig spleen membranes. Guinea pig spleen membranes are prepared as described by Chang et al. (J. Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics 232: 80, 1985). The <sup>3</sup>H- LTB<sub>4</sub> binding assay is performed in 150 mg/liter containing 50 mM Tris pH 7.3, 10 mM MgCI<sub>2</sub>, 9% Methanol, 0.7 nM <sup>3</sup>H- LTB<sub>4</sub> (NEN, approximately 200 Ci/mmol) and 0.33 mg/ml guinea pig spleen membranes. Unlabeled LTB<sub>4</sub> \n\nis added at a concentration 5 micromolar to determine non-specific binding. Experimental compounds are added at varying concentrations to evaluate their effects on <sup>3</sup>H-LTB<sub>4</sub> binding. The reactions are incubated at 4 degrees C. for 30 minutes. Membrane bound <sup>3</sup>H-LTB<sub>4</sub> is collected by filtration through glass fiber filters and the amount bound is determined by scintillation counting. The IC<sub>50</sub> value for an experimental compound is the concentration at which 50% of specific <sup>3</sup>H-LTB<sub>4</sub> binding is inhibited.</p>\n  [000151] A combination therapy of a COX-2 inhibitor and an LTB<sub>4</sub> receptor antagonist can be evaluated as described in the following tests:</p>\n  EXAMPLE 3. Induction and assessment of collagen induced arthritis in mice</p>\n  A. Induction of Collagen-Induced Arthritis.</p>\n  [000152] Arthritis is induced in 8-12 week old male DBA/1 mice by injection of 50 micrograms of chick type Il collagen (CII) in complete Freunds adjuvant (Sigma) on day 0 at the base of the tail as described in J. Stuart, Annual Rev. Immunol., 2, 199 (1984). Compounds are prepared as a suspension in 0.5% methylcelluose (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 0.025% Tween 20 (Sigma). The COX-"
