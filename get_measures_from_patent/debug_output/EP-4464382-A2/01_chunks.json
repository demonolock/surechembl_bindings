Generation of mouse/human chimeric monoclonal antibodiesFor chimerization, the murine heavy chain and light chain variable region including leader sequences were amplified by PCR using primers listed in the table below. The murine heavy chains were fused by an ApaI restriction site (5'-GGGCCC-3') to the N- terminal part of the human Fcgamma1 chain, which was encoded by the expression vector. Variable domains of the murine kappa chain including leader sequences were cloned in front of the constant region using a BsiWI restriction site. The correct orientation of the constant region in the vector, i.e. suitable for the preceeding promoter of the vector, was verified by sequencing. Due to the position of the ApaI restriction site, any amplification of a variable region including leader sequence for this purpose has to include the first 11 ",
