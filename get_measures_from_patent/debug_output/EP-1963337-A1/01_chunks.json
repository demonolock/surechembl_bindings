    "he procedure was carried out in few cases in sealed tube or by a microwave assisted reaction between 100-150 oC temperature.</p>Compounds of formula (Di) wherein Z is methoxy group may be prepared by the well known method described by Neumann K. (Chem. Ber.; 48, 1915, 961). Compound of formula (Di) wherein Z is chloro or bromo was reacted with sodium methoxyde in methanol between O-6O0C temperature.</p>The fluoronation reaction starting from the corresponding chloro or bromo compound of formula (Di) can be done with potassium fluoride in a suitable solvent e.g. DMF or DMSO between 100-150 <sup>0</sup>C temperature applied the simplified method of Hochberg R. B.;(J. Med. Chem. ; 45, 2002, 5397) resulting the 4-fluoro compounds of formula (Di) .</p>All work-up of the reaction mixture can be carried out by different methods well known in the synthetic chemistry process. The products can be purified by crystallization or by column or flash cromatography.</p>Biological test methods</p>MGIuRl receptor binding test</p>MGIuRl receptor binding testes were performed according to modified method of</p>Lavreysen et al. (Mol.Pharm., 2003, 63, 1082). Based on the high homology between the human and rat mGluRl receptors, rat cerebellar membrane preaparation was used to determine the binding characteristics of reference compounds and novel compounds to the rat mGluRl. As radioligand [3HJR214127 (3 nM) was used and the nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 \u03bcM of R214127. \n\n IC-50 values were determined from displacement curves by nonlinear regression analysis and were converted by equation method of Cheng and Prusoff (Biochem. Pharmacol., 1973, 22, 3099) to Ki values.</p>MGluR5 receptor binding tests</p>MGluR5 receptor binding was determined according to Gasparini et.al. (Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2000, 12:407-409) with modifications. Rat cerebro-cortical membrane preparation was used to determine the binding characteristics of reference compounds and novel compounds to the rat mGluR5. The A18 cell line expressing hmGluR5a (purchased from Euroscreen) was used to determine binding characteristics of the chemical compounds to the human mGluR5a receptor. As radioligand [3H]-M-MPEP (2 nM) was used. The nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 \u03bcM M-MPEP.</p>Assessment of functional activity</p>Cell cultures for native rat mGluR5 and niGluRl receptors</p>Functional potency at native rat mGluR5 and mGluRl receptors was estimated using primary neocortical cell cultures derived from 17 day old Charles River rat embryos and primary cerebellar cell cultures derived from 4-day old Wistar rats, respectively (for the details on the preparation of neural cell cultures see Johnson, M.I.; Bunge, R.P. (1992):</p>Primary cell cultures of peripheral and central neurons and glia. In: Protocols for Neural Cell</p>Culture, eds: Fedoroff, S.; Richardson A., The Humana Press Inc., 51-77). After isolation the cells were plated onto standard 96-well microplates and the cultures were maintained in an atmosphere of 95% air-5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37 <sup>0</sup>C. The neocortical and cerebellar cultures were used for the calcium measurements aft",
    "illations of [Ca2+]i, in the case of cerebellar cultures probenecid was substituted with sulfinpyrazone (0.25 mM).</p>After incubation at 37 <sup>0</sup>C for 10-20 min. baseline and agonist-evoked changes of [Ca2+]i were measured column by column with a plate reader fluorimeter (FlexStation II, Molecular Devices). Excitation and detection of emission was carried out from the bottom of the plate. The whole measurement process was performed at 37 \u00b0C and was controlled by custom software. Inhibitory potency of the test compounds was assessed by measuring the reduction in the agonist-evoked [Ca<sup>2+</sup>Jj -elevation in the presence of different concentrations \n\n of the compounds. DHPG was used as agonist for all three cultures, the concentration was 20 and 100 \u03bcM for neocortical and cerebellar cultures, respectively. In the case of CHO- mGluR5a cells DHPG was applied at an EC80 concentration, the EC80- values were derived from daily determined dose-response curves. Fluorescence data were expressed as \u0394F/F (fluorescence change normalized to baseline).</p>All treatments on a single plate were measured in multiple wells. Data from all wells with the same treatment were averaged and the average values were used for analysis. Inhibitory potency of a compound at a single concentration point was expressed as percent inhibition of the control agonist response. Sigmoidal concentration-inhibition curves were fitted to the data (derived from at least three independent experiments) and IC50-values were determined as the concentration that produces half of the maximal inhibition caused by the compound. Raw fluorescence data were analyzed using Soft Max Pro (Molecular Devices), curve fitting was done with GraphPad Prism.</p>Results</p>Compounds of formula (I) of the present invention showed affinity for both rat and human mGluRl and mGluR5 receptors and proved to be functional antagonists that are they inhibited functional responses elicited by stimulation of mGluR5 receptors.</p>Table</p></p></p></p>* K<sub>1</sub> &lt;500nM</p>** 500nM&lt;Ki &lt; 150OnM</p>*** Ki &gt;1500nM</p><sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra were obtained on a Varian Unity Inova 300, Varian Unity Inova 500 or on a Varian V-400 spectrometer. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million relative to TMS as internal standard.</p>The invention is further illustrated by the following non-limiting examples.</p>Examples Example 1</p>(4-Chloro-phenyl)-(2-chloro-pyridin-3-yI)-methanone Intermedier (II)</p>Thionyl chloride (15 ml, 0.2 mol) and DMF (0.5 ml) were added dropwise to the suspension of 2-chloro-nicotinic acid (31.5 g, 0,2 mol) in chlorobenzene (100 ml) and the reaction mixture was stirred at 120 <sup>0</sup>C for 4 hours. Aluminium chloride (33 g, 0.25 mol) was added at 0 \u00b0C to the reaction mixture, and it was boiled for 6 hours. The reaction mixture was poured onto ice (100 ml) and ethyl acetate (100 ml) was added. The mixture was stirred for half an hour at room temperature. The pH was adjusted to 8 by aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (40%). The emulsion was filtered, the filtrate was separated and extracted by ethyl acetate (2x50 ml). The organic phase was washed with water (100 ml) dried over Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and concentrated in vacuo. The crude product was crystallized from isopropanol (20 ml) to yield 19.5 g (34%) of the titled compound.</p>The reaction is the same when we started from 2-chloro-5-nitro-nicotinic acid (Klunder, J.
