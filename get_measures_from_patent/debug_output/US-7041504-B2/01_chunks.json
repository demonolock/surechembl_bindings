    "n-alginate; polyhydroxylethyl-methacrylate-methyl methacrylate; carbonylmethylcellulose; K-carrageenan; chitosan; agarose-polyethersulphone-hexadi-methirine-bromide (Polybrene); ethyl-cellulose; silica gels; and combinations thereof.</p>The structures which comprise the compositions of matter may take many shapes, such as a bead, a sphere, a cylinder, a capsule, a sheet or any other shape which is suitable for implantation in a subject, and/or culture in an in vitro milieu. The size of the structure can vary, depending upon its eventual use, as will be clear to the skilled artisan.</p>The structures of the invention are selectively permeable, such that nutrients may enter the structure, and so that the proliferation-inhibiting material as well as cellular waste may leave the structure. For in vivo use, it is preferred that the structures prevent the entry of products or cells of the immune system of a host which would cause the rejection of the cancer cells, or otherwise impair their ability of the cancer cells producing the proliferation-suppressive material.</p>Another aspect of the invention includes compositions which are useful in suppressing cancer cell proliferation. These compositions are prepared by culturing restricted cells as described supra in an appropriate culture medium, followed by recovery of the resultant conditioned medium. Concentrates can then be formed from the conditioned medium, e.g., by separating fractions having molecular weight of greater than 30 kd or greater than 50 kd, which have high anti-proliferative effect on cancer cells.</p>As the examples show, the invention is not limited to any particular type of cancer; any neoplastic cell may be used in accordance with the invention. Exemplary types of cancer cells which can be used are renal cancer cells, mammary cancer cells, prostate cancer cells, choriocarcinoma cells and so forth. The cancer cells may be of epithelial, mesothelial, endothelial or germ cell origin, and include cancer cells that generally do not form solid tumors such as leukemia cells.</p>As will be clear from this disclosure, a further aspect of the invention is therapeutic methods for treating individuals suffering from cancer. When used in a therapeutic context, as will be elaborated upon infra, the type of cancer cell restricted in the structure need not be the same type of cancer from which the subject is suffering, although it can be. One such method involves inserting at least one of the structures of the invention into the subject, in an amount sufficient to cause suppression of cancer-cell proliferation in the subject. Preferably, the subject is a human being, although it is applicable to other animals, such as domestic animals, farm animals, or any type of animal which suffers from cancer.</p>The composition of the present invention can be used as primary therapy in the treatment of cancer, and as an adjunct treatment in combination with other cancer therapies. For example, patients may be treated with compositi"
