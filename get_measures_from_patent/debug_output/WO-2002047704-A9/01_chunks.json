Lane 6 is the placebo treatment.</p>\n  Figure 11 compare the effects of American ginseng in the form of (1) powder, (2) aqueous extract in 95% alcohol, (3) aqueous extract in water, and (4) aqueous extract in 50% alcohol, on the level of IgG<sub>2a</sub> and IgE. Values are means \u00b1 SEM. The figure indicates that American ginseng extracted by 50% alcohol produced slightly better effects in terms of decreasing IgE and increasing IgG, than water extract. \n\n Figure 12 compares the effects of lantern tridax in the form of (1) powder, (2) aqueous extract in 95% alcohol, (3) aqueous extract in water, and (4) aqueous extract in 50% alcohol, on the level of IgE, IgG<sub>2a</sub>, IL-4, and IFN-\u03b3. Values are means \u00b1 SEM. * indicates significant difference from control. Results indicate that 50% ethanol extract of lantern tridax was most effective on inhibiting IgE and increasing IgG.</p>\n  Figure 13 is a comparative study of the effects of STA-36, STA-4, and control (the placebo group) on IgG and IgE in serum of female B ALB/c mice. * indicates significant difference (p &lt; 0.05) between STA-4 and control. Values are means \u00b1 SEM. The dosage amount of STA-36 (20 mg/20 g mouse) was twice of the dosage amount (10 mg/20 g mouse) of STA-4 (Le,, STA-3 : STA-4 = 2: 1). The results show that in terms of IgE, although both STA-36 and STA-4 show inhibition on IgE, only STA-4 is statistically significance from control. As of IgG, both STA-36 and STA-4 show increase in IgG. However, although it appears that STA-36 shows greater increase in IgG level than STA-4, neither increase is significantly different from the control. Figure 14 is a comparative study of the effects of STA-36 and STA-4 on Lung</p>\n  Functions. Values are means \u00b1 SEM. Both STA-36 and STA-4 show significant improvement in lung functions (as determined by measurement of acetylcholine) as compared to control (P &lt; 0.05). Between the treatment of STA-36 and STA-4, although it appears that STA-4 had better effect than STA-36, the difference between STA-36 and STA-4 was nevertheless not statistically significant probably due to insufficient numbers of animals used in each group. The dosage amount of STA-36 (20 mg/20 g mouse) was twice of the dosage amount (10 mg/20 g mouse) of STA-4.</p>\n  Figure 15 compares the effects STA-4 on IgE, IgG, IL-4, and IFN-7 with those of the conventional drugs (for treating asthma) including Ketotifen, Prednisolone, and Aminophline. Values are means \u00b1 SEM. * indicates significant difference from control. The results of this study indicate that STA-4 significantly lowered the level of IgE, but significantly increased the level of IgG<sub>2a</sub>, 11-4 and IFN- \u03b3.</p>\n  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION.

Pharm. Co\u03c6., Taipei, Taiwan) were mixed with 180 \u03bcl of Tween 80, respectively, and homogenized (homogenizer DC-3S, Xinguang Precision Instrument Industrial Limited, Inc., Taiwan). Water was added to the homogenate to bring the final volume to 2 ml, and the final concentration 25 mg/ml. Each mouse received 0.4 ml per 20 g body weight of one of the herbal composition solution or placebo every other day for fourteen (14) days. (B) Animals</p>\n  Female BALB/c mice aged between 4 and 6 weeks were obtained from the National Animal-breeding Center, Republic of China and used in the studies. Mice were age- and sex- matched for each experiment. (C). Allergen De\u03c65 (Dermatophagoidespteronvssinus group 5 allergen) Purification pGEX-2T plasmid was used to express Der p 5-glutathion S-transferase (GST) in E. coli. The molecular weight of the fusion protein was about 42 kD. The protein was purified by glutathione-conjugated agarose gel column chromatography. A single colony of the Der p 5-GST positive-bacterial strain was selected by growing the transfected E. coli on LB broth containing Ampicillin (100 \u03bcg/ml). The Der p 5-GST positive E. coli colony was further cultured to produce substantial amount of Der p 5-GST. Then, the bacterial culture was collected and centrifuged. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was washed with TBS (pH 7.5) and collected in a centrifuge tube. Immediately following the TBS wash, 0.1 M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to the pellet, followed by the addition of DNase I, Tween 20, and lysozyme. The pellet was lyzed by the freeze-and-thaw process to release Der p 5 + GST protein. Subsequently, EDTA was added to the cell lysate, which was then centrifuged. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was poured onto a glutathione-conjugated agarose gel adso\u03c6tion column where Der p 5-GST protein was adsorbed onto the column. The column was washed first by TBS buffer solution at 4\u00b0C, and then by reduced glutathione in Tris-base (pH 8.0) to separate the Der p 5-GST from the agarose gel column. The purity of the Der p 5-GST protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. The quantity of the protein was measured by conventional protein analytical methods. (D) Animal Sensitization \n\n B ALB/c mice were initially intraperitoneally sensitized with 10 \u03bcg of Dermatophagoides pteronyssimus group 5 (\"Der p 5\") allergen and 4",
    "expressions of IL-4 gene (measured by RT-PCR and expressed as IL-4/HPRT ratio) in mice splenocytes after challenged by Der p 5 and then treated by ophiopogon, tang-shen, pinellia, and raw licorice, respectively, were not significantly different from that of the placebo. However, the expression of IL-4 gene ratio) after treatment of STA-36 was significantly lower than that of the placebo, indicating that the STA-36 could down-regulate the expression of IL-4 gene.</p>\n  EXAMPLE 6 \n\n Methods of Determining IgG, IgE, IL-4 and IFN- In Animals The effects of the STA-36 and STA-4 herbal composition as well as individual herbs on suppression of allergen-induced immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin E (IgE), interleukin-4 (IL-4), and interferon \u03b3 (LFN-\u03b3) were investigated using B ALB/c mice sensitized with D.P. (Dermatophagoides pteronyssimus) allergen \"Der p 5\".</p>\n  Dermatophagoides pteronyssimus is the house dust mite which acts as an antigen and produces an allergic asthmatic reaction in atopic person. Experimental Design: (A) Animals Female B ALB/c mice aged between 4 and 6 weeks and weighed about 20 g were obtained from the National Animal-breeding Center, Republic of China and used in the studies. Mice were age- and sex- matched for each experiment. (B).

    "ean\u00b1 SEM.\" Trachea resistance change induced by acetylcholine after converted to PC 100 was measured as \u03bcg/kg. Ig E and Ig G<sub>2a</sub> measurement were shown based upon value of optical abso\u03c6tion. \n\nThe unpaired student's t test was used to determine the significance of the differences among the groups. A p&lt;0.05 was used to indicate statistical significant difference.</p>\n  EXAMPLE 7 Effects of Aqueous Extraction of the Herbs on IgG and IgE</p>\n  Various aqueous extraction methods were tested on American ginseng and lantern tridax to determine the optimal form of aqueous extract to be used in the herbal composition.</p>\n  American ginseng in (1) powder, (2) 95% alcohol extract, (3) water extract, and (4) 50% alcohol extract was tested for its medicinal effects on suppression of IgE and IgG<sub>2a</sub>. As shown in Figure 11 , American ginseng extracted with 50% alcohol produced the best IgE suppression effect, even though its effect on IgG<sub>2a</sub> reduction was not as good as that extracted in 95% alcohol. Because antigen-induced immunological disorders were primarily IgE mediated diseases, it appears that using 50% alcohol extraction for American ginseng in the herbal composition should provide the best IgE reduction result for the composition. However, when the granules produced from the alcohol extract of American ginseng were added to the rest of the granules, the granules produced from the water extract of American ginseng provided better effects on both IgE inhibition and IgG elevation. Thus, in the STA- 4 composition, the American ginseng was extracted from water.</p>\n  Lantern tridax in (1) powder, (2) 95% alcohol extract, (3) water extract, and (4) 50% alcohol extract was also tested for its medicinal effects on suppression of IgE, IgG<sub>2a</sub>, IL-4 and LFN-7. As shown in Figure 12, lantern tridax extracted with 50% alcohol produced the best IgE and IgG<sub>2a</sub> suppression effect, even though the water extract of lantern tridax had demonstrated the best suppression effect on IL-4 and LFN-\u03b3. Nevertheless, because the water extract of lantern tridax had induced blood clotting in animals during the studies, it was not under consideration for use in humans.</p>\n  EXAMPLE 8</p>\n  Comparison of the Effects of STA-36 and STA-4 on IgE, IgG. IL-4, IFN-y and Lung Functions A comparative study between the medicinal effects of herbal compositions of STA-</p>\n  36 and STA-4 on IgE, IgG, IL-4, and LFN-7, as well as on lung functions was conducted in experimental animals as described in Example 3 (supra). The results of this study were shown in Figures 13-15. \n\n Figure 13 showed a comparative study of the effects of the herbal compositions of STA-36 and STA-4 on IgG and IgE in mice. As shown in Figure 13, both the herbal compositions of STA-36 and STA-4 demonstrated suppression of IgE, as compared with the control, with the effect of STA-4 much greater than that of STA-36. The inhibitory effect on IgE by STA-4 was statistically si"
