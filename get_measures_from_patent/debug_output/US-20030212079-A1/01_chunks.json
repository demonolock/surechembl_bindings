IC50s for neuroprotection are the mean of three separate curves with upper and lower 95% confidence intervals (C.I.) shown. Curves were fit, and confidence intervals were determined using GraphPad Prism software. </p>EXAMPLE 4 Evaluation of a MEK1/2 Inhibitor in the Differentiated P19 Assay [0197] U0126 (bis[amino[(2-aminophenyl)thio]methylene] Butanedinitrile) is reported to be highly selective for MEK1/2 (Favata et al. 1998), a result that was confirmed here. The only other kinase found that U0126 inhibits is PKC-\u03b3, but the IC50 for inhibition of this enzyme was 60-fold higher that its published IC50 against wildtype MEK1/2 (Tables II and III below). </p>[0198] The general procedure used to assay for kinase activity was as follows: a kinase reaction mix was prepared in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH=8, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 10 \u03bcM ATP, 0.25-1 \u03bcM biotinylated peptide substrate, 0.2-0.8 \u03bcCuries per well <sup>33</sup>P-\u03b3-ATP [2000-3000 Ci/mmol]. Assay conditions varied slightly for each protein kinase, for example, insulin receptor kinase requires 10 mM MnCl<sub>2 </sub>for activity and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase requires calmodulin and 10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Reaction mix was dispensed into the wells of a streptavidin-coated Flashplate and 1 \u03bcl drug stock in 100% DMSO was added to a 100 \u03bcL reaction volume resulting in a final concentration of 1% DMSO in the reaction. Enzyme was diluted in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH=8.0, 0.1% BSA and added to each well. The reaction was incubated for one hour at 30\u00b0 C. in the presence of compound. After one hour the reaction mix was aspirated from the plate and the plate washed with PBS containing 100 mM EDTA. The plate was read on a scintillation counter to determine <sup>33</sup>P-\u03b3-ATP incorporated into the immobilized peptide. Test compounds were assayed in duplicate at 8 concentrations ranging from 100 \u03bcM to 10 pM in one order of magnitude steps. A maximum and minimum signal for the assay was determined on each plate. The IC50 was calculated from the dose response curve of the percent inhibition of the maximum signal in the assay according to the formula [max signal-background/test compound signal-background (100)=% inhibition] by graphing the percent inhibition against the log concentration of test compound. Known inhibitor compounds appropriate for the kinase being assayed were also included on each plate. Results are provided in FIG. 3. </p>[0199] Definition and Source of Kinase Enzymes </p>[0200] VEGF-R (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2) is a fusion protein containing a polyhistidine tag at the N-terminus followed by amino acids 786-1343 of the rat VEGF-R2 kinase domain. CDK1 (cyclin dependent kinase 1) is isolated from insect cells expressing both the human CDK1 catalytic subunit and its positive regulatory subunit cyclin B. Insulin Receptor Kinase consists of residues 941-1313 of the cytoplasmic domain of the beta-subunit of the human insulin receptor. Protein Kinase A is the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase-A purified from bovine heart. PKC (protein kinase-C) is the gamma or beta isoform of the human protein produced in insect cells. Casein Kinase 1 is a truncation at amino acid 318 of the C-terminal portion of the rat CK1 delta isoform produced in E. coli. Casein Kinase 2 includes the alpha and beta subunits of the human CK2 protein produced in E. coli. Calmodulin Kinase (calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 2) is a truncated version of the alpha subunit of the rat protein produced in insect cells. Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 is the beta isoform of the rabbit enzyme produced in E. coli. MAP Kinase is the rat ERK-2 isoform containing a polyhistidine tag at the N-terminus produced in E. coli and activated by phosphorylation with MEK1 prior to purification. EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) is purified from human A431 cell membranes. The chart below shows selected kinases and their control inhibitors. </p>[0201] As used in Table III below, Compound A (Cmpd A) shall mean the compound have the formula  \nTABLE II<img id=\"EMI-C00036\" path=\"US20030212079A1-20031113-C00036.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/20948883/US/20031113/A1/020030/21/20/79/US20030212079A1-20031113-C00036.TIF\"/> Selected Kinases and Their Control InhibitorsKinaseControl InhibitorCDK1ButyrolactoneEGFRAG-1478Protein Kinase AH89PKCStaurosporineCasein Kinase 1H89Casein Kinase 2Calmodulin KinaseStaurosporineInsulin KinaseStaurosporine\n</p>[0202]TABLE IIIKinase Selectivity of Compound A and U0126CompoundCDK1EGF-RPK APKC-\u03b3ID(\u03bcM)(\u03bcM)(\u03bcM)(\u03bcM)Cmpd A&gt;100&gt;100&gt;100\u20028.35U0126&gt;100&gt;100&gt;10029.5CaseinCaseinCalmodulinInsulinCompoundKinase 1Kinase 2KinaseReceptorID(\u03bcM)(\u03bcM)(\u03bcM)Kinase (\u03bcM)Cmpd A0.116&gt;100&gt;100&gt;100U0126&gt;100&gt;100&gt;100ND</p>[0203] IC50 values for kinase inhibition are the mean of at least two separate curves, and were determined using GraphPad curve fitting software. </p>[0204] To determine whether U0126 inhibits the MEK1/2 enzymes in P19 neurons, its ability to block glutamate-induced phosphorylation of the MEK1/2 substrate p42 MAPK (ERK2) was tested. Western blot were first probed using ATRA P19 neuron lysates 9 days post treatment with an antibody specific for the phosphorylated form of p42/44 (ERK1/2) and then stripped and reprobed with antibody that recognized total p42/44 (ERK\u00bd). The data demonstrate that the concentrations of glutamate and glycine that were used to induce toxicity in P19 neurons also induced a rapid, reproducible increase in p42 MAPK phosphorylation in these cells. In the presence of U0126, phospho-p42 MAPK was reduced, although no change in the amount of total p42 MAPK was evident. In another Western blot experiment, ATRA P19 neuron lysates were probed 9 days post treatment with an antibody specific for the phosphorylated form of p42/44 (ERK\u00bd). The same blot was stripped and reprobed with an antibody that recognized total p42/44 (ERK\u00bd). Glutamate-induced elevation of p42 MAPK phosphorylation was sustained, since it was still clearly increased at 24 h versus controls. These blots are representative of 3 separate experiments with similar results. U0126 blocked the increased levels of phosphorylation at this time point as well. No change in total p42 MAPK was evident. </p>[0205] T",
    "y compounds with diverse mechanisms are reported to exhibit post-treatment delayed neuroprotection. Among these are glutamate receptor antagonists (Li et al. 1999b; Takahashi et al. 1998; Turski et al. 1998), antioxidants (Callaway et al. 1999; Pazos et al. 1999; Sakakibara et al. 2000), anticonvulsants (Schwartz-Bloom et al. 1998; Wasterlain et al. 1996; Yang et al. 1998), protease inhibitors (Cheng et al. 1998), kinase inhibitors (Tatlisumak et al. 1998), and magnesium (Heath and Vink 1999). However, this is the first demonstration in a cell culture model of NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity wherein a specific inhibitor of the p42/44 MAP kinase pathway exhibits delayed neuroprotection, and wherein the time window of efficacy extended well after the onset of toxic challenge. </p>[0211] U0126 Neuroprotection is Selective for Glutamate-Induced Toxicity. </p>[0212] To determine whether U0126 is protective against a variety of nonspecific toxic insults, or whether the efficacy of this compound is selective for glutamate-induced toxicity, its effects were tested against a variety of other inducers of P19 neuron death. </p>[0213]FIG. 6A shows P19 neuron treatment with various concentrations of A23187 for 24 hours in the presence or absence of 10 \u03bcM U0126. Cells were then assayed for Alamar blue fluorescence. The curve generated through the data points is the average of 3 separate dose response curves. Data points are represented as percent of control cells\u00b1standard error. The EC50 for A23187 toxicity in the absence of U0126 was calculated to be 520 nM [340 nM-784 nM]. The EC50 for A23187 toxicity in the presence of 10 \u03bcM U0126 was calculated to be 833 nM [440 nM-1.6 \u03bcM]. </p>[0214]FIG. 6B shows that 1 \u03bcM staurosporine-induced P19 neuron toxicity could not be protected by 10 \u03bcM U0126, as measured by Alamar blue fluorescence at 24 hours after addition. Cells that received vehicle rather than staurosporine exhibited control levels of Alamar blue fluorescence. However no concentration of U0126 brought fluorescence back to control levels in staurosporine-treated cells. </p>[0215]FIG. 6C demonstrates Alamar blue fluorescence assayed on P19 neurons treated with vehicle or with 10 \u03bcM U0126 in the absence of any inducers of toxicity. U0126 alone did not affect these control levels of fluorescence. The data demonstrate that U0126 was not protective against staurosporine or A23187-induced death (FIGS. 6A, 6B). Additionally, U0126 did not affect the basal viability of P19 neurons (FIG. 6C). </p>EXAMPLE 5 Drug Screening Using Differentiated P19 Cell Assay [0216] Commercially available chemical libraries (BioFocus PLC, UK) were screened using the methods described herein. The stock concentration of the compounds was about 400 \u03bcM in DMSO. The concentration of compounds used in the primary screen was 1 \u03bcM. A positive compound was assigned as one that demonstrated 70% or greater neuroprotection. Dose-response testing was carried out in 96 well plates where column 1 was vehicle control, column 2 received 3 mM glutamate and 1 mM glycine, and column 3 received 3 mM glutamate, 1 mM glycine, and 10 \u03bcM U0126. Columns 4-11 received compounds at the following final concentrations (\u03bcM): 3, 1.2, 0.48, 0.192, 0.077, 0.031, 0.012 and 0.005. Each row contained a different compound for confirmation. Only rows B-G received compounds, and rows A and H remained untreated. Data are expressed as % neuroprotection=((compound-glutamate average)/(U0126-glutamate average)\u00d7100). </p>[0217] Compounds of two genuses, 4-pyrimidinamines and 2-pyridinamines, were found to display neuroprotective properties as data here show. Only the 4-pyridinamines are the subject of this invention, although limited data for 2-pyridinamines are presented as well. The results of this biological testing are summarized in the following tables. \u201c% Inh\u201d indicates the percentage of control cells surviving after 24 hours, and represents the neuroprotective effect of the compounds screened at 1 micromolar concentration. IC50 relate to data from dose response experiments. IC50 values listed as &gt;1 indicate no observed maximum within the highest dose tested (3 \u03bcM), yet indicate biological activity. ND refers to compounds not tested in dose-response experiments.  \nTABLE IV<img id=\"EMI-C00037\" path=\"US20030212079A1-20031113-C00037.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/20948892/US/20031113/A1/020030/21/20/79/US20030212079A1-20031113-C00037.TIF\"/> N,6-diphenyl-4-pyrimidinamine derivativesCmpdR<sub>10</sub>R<sub>12</sub>R<sub>16</sub>R<sub>14</sub>IC<sub>50</sub>(\u03bcM)% Inh41(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Nfused to form naphthylH0.547242(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NO(CH<sub>2</sub>)PhHH0.2\u20028043(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NHPhH0.228844(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NH3,5(CF<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>H0.2689 45<img id=\"EMI-C00038\" path=\"US20030212079A1-20031113-C00038.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/20948831/US/20031113/A1/020030/21/20/79/US20030212079A1-20031113-C00038.TIF\"/>fused to form naphthylH0.5793 46<img id=\"EMI-C00039\" path=\"US20030212079A1-20031113-C00039.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/20948788/US/20031113/A1/020030/21/20/79/US20030212079A1-20031113-C00039.TIF\"/>HPhH0.0787 47<img id=\"EMI-C00040\" path=\"US20030212079A1-20031113-C00040.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/20948811/US/20031113/A1/020030/21/20/79/US20030212079A1-20031113-C00040.TIF\"/>PhHH0.4994 48<img id=\"EMI-C00041\" path=\"US20030212079A1-20031113-C00041.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/atta"
