Individuals that fail to express CCR5 are largely resistant to HIV-1 infection. (Paxton, et al., Nat Med, 2:412 (1996); Dean, et al., Science, 273:1856 (1996)). Due to its prominent role in HIV-1 fusion and entry, investigators have foccussed considerable reasearch on developing molecules that interrupt the interaction between the HIV-1 envelope and CCR5. Chemokine ligands and antibodies specific for CCR5, for example, have been shown to inhibit HIV-1 entry and replication. (Cocchi et al., Science, 270:1811 (1995); Wu et al., J Exp Med, 186: 373 (1997); Proudfoot et al., J Biol Chem, 271:2599 (1996); Arenzana-Seisdedos et al., Nature, 383:400 (1996); Gong et al., J Biol Chem, 273:4289 (1998)). </p>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0006] One aspect of the invention concerns novel ligands for FPR class receptors that modulate a host immune response to a pathogen. Another aspect of the invention concerns the discovery that activated FPR class receptors promote phosphorylation and downregulation of CCR5, which, in turn, inhibits HIV infection. Several different ligands were found to interact with FPR class receptors and stimulate Ca+2 mobilization and chemotaxis in phagocytes. It was also found that the interaction of several of these ligands with the FPR class receptors resulted in the phosphorylation and downregulation of CCR5 and/or the inhibition of HIV infection. </p>[0007] In initial experiments, it was observed that binding of fMLP to an FPR class receptor resulted in phosphorylation and downregulation of CCR5 and the inhibition of HIV infection. Other experiments revealed that a synthetic peptide derived from the V3 region of gp120 (called \u201cV3 peptide\u201d), a synthetic peptide corresponding to a region in the C-terminus of the ectodomain of gp41 (called \u201cT20/DP178\u201d or \u201cT20\u201d), and serum amyloid A (\u201cSAA\u201d) activated FPR class receptors and induced the phosphorylation of CCR5. Additionally, it was found that a synthetic hexapeptide known as the leukocyte activating peptide or \u201cW peptide\u201d activated an FPR class receptor, induced Ca<sup>+2 </sup>mobilization and chemotaxis in phagocytes, and inhibited HIV-1 infection. </p>[0008] Embodiments of the invention include methods of identifying agents that inhibit HIV infection by interacting with an FPR class receptor. One approach involves techniques in rational drug design, whereby, compounds that resemble ligands for FPR class receptors (also referred to as \u201cbinding partners\u201d) are designed and created using computer based homology searching, protein modeling, and combinatorial chemistry. These candidate binding partners are then evaluated for the ability to phosphorylate CCR5 and/or inhibit HIV infection in \u201cbinding partner characterization assays\u201d. Agents that inhibit HIV infection are identified by their ability to phosphorylate CCR5 and/or inhibit HIV infection in the binding partner characterization assays. By another approach, random libraries of molecules are contacted to cells expressing CD4, CCR5, and an FPR class receptor and agents that inh",
    "-CCR5 antibody was used. Panel (D) shows monocytes treated with different concentrations of V3 peptide for 60 min at 37\u00b0 C., cells treated with MIP-1\u03b1 (100 nM) and MIP-1\u03b2 (100 nM) for 1 min were used as control. Panel (E) shows monocytes treated with V3 peptide (1.5 \u03bcM) for different time points. Cells treated with MIP-1\u03b1 (100 nM) for 1 min or with fMLP (1 \u03bcM) for 60 min were used as control. Panel (F) shows the effect of staurosporine (Stauro, 2.5 ng/ml, 30 min) on CCR5 phosphorylation induced by MIP-1\u03b2 (100 nM, 1 min at 37\u00b0 C.) or V3 peptide (1.5 \u03bcM, 60 min). Panel (G) shows monocytes treated with SAA at 10 \u03bcg/ml for different time periods (min) at 37\u00b0 C. Panel (H) shows monocytes treated with different concentrations of SAA for 60 min at 37\u00b0 C. The inset shows the immunoblotting of 20 \u03bcg whole monocyte lysates with anti-CCR5 antibody. </p>[0031]FIG. 11 (A and B) W peptide induces phagocyte migration. </p>[0032] Different concentrations of W peptide were placed in the lower wells of the chemotaxis chamber, cell suspension was placed in the upper wells. The upper and lower wells were separated by polycarbonate filters. After incubation, the cells that had migrated across the filters were stained and counted. Panel (A) shows the fold increase of monocyte and neutrophil migration in response to W peptide over control medium. A chemotaxis index greater than 1.8 is statistically significant compared to spontaneous migration in the absence of chemoattractant. Panel (B) shows the inhibition of monocyte migration in response to W peptide by pretreatment of the cells with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin (PT) or cholera toxin (CT) at 37\u00b0 C. for 30 min. The peptide T21, a FPRL1 stimulating peptide domain of HIV-1 envelope gp41, was used as a control. (*P&lt;0.01 compared to migration of cells incubated with medium alone). </p>[0033]FIG. 12 (A-H) W peptide induces calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) mobilization in phagocytes </p>[0034] Human monocytes or neutrophils were loaded with Fura-2 and then were stimulated with various concentrations of W peptide panels (A and E). The ratio of fluorescence at 340 and 380 nm wave length was recorded and calculated using the FLWinLab program. Desensitization of W peptide induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux by fMLP in monocytes panels (B and C) or neutrophils panels (F and G) and was measured by sequentially stimulating the cells with both agonists and vice versa panels (D and H). </p>[0035]FIG. 13 (A-H) W peptide induces calcium mobilization in ETFR and FPRL1/293 cells </p>[0036] ETFR cells (upper panels) and FPRL1/293 cells (lower panels) were used to evaluate Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux induced by fMLP (panel (A and E)) or W peptide (panel (B and F)). Panels (C, D, G, and H) show cross-desensitization of cell signaling between W peptide and fMLP. </p>[0037]FIG. 14 (A-C) W peptide induces migration of FPRL1/293 and ETFR cells in response to W peptide. </p>[0038] Panels (A and B) show the fold increase (chemotaxis index) of FRPL1/293 cell or ETFR cell migration in response to W peptide or fMLP over control medium. A CI greater than 1.8 was statistically significant compared to spontaneous cell migration in the absence of chemoattractant. Panel (C) shows the inhibition of FPRL1/293 cell migration in response to W peptide by pretreatment of the cells with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin (PT) at 37\u00b0 C. for 30 min. (*P&lt;0.01 compared to migration of cells incubated with medium alone.) </p>[0039]FIG. 15 W peptide can displace <sup>3</sup>H-fMLP that is bound to ETFR or FPRL1/293 cells. </p>[0040] Aliquots of cells (2\u00d710<sup>6</sup>/200 \u03bcl) were incubated with <sup>3</sup>H-fMLP (0.2 nM) in the presence of different concentrations of unlabeled fMLP or W peptide at 37\u00b0 C. for 30 min. The cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS (phosphate buffered saline) and filtered onto Whatman discs. The radioactivity associated with the cells was measured with a \u03b2 counter. Three experiments were performed and yielded similar results. </p>[0041]FIG. 16 (A and B) W peptide inhibits HIV infection. </p>[0042] Hos cells expressing CD4/CCR5/FPRL1 receptors were first treated with W peptide at designated concentrations for 1 hour follwed by infection with HIV-1<sub>JRFL </sub>for one hour. The infected cells were washed three times with medium and placed in culture. The levels of p24 were measured by ELISA at 48 hours and 72 hours post-infection. Panel (A) shows that exposure of W peptide [10<sup>\u22125</sup>M] at the initial step of HIV-1 infection significantly reduced HIV-1 infectivity in FPRL1 transfectants but not mock transfected cells. Panel (B) shows that W peptide can reduce HIV-1 infectivity at concentrations as low as 10<sup>\u221211</sup>M. These experime",
    "gands for FPR class receptors is provided in this disclosure. Additionally, it is shown that ligands for FPR class receptors induce the phosphorylation and downregulation of CCR5 receptors and inhibit HIV infection. Preferably, molelcules that interact with FPR class receptors are provided to human dendritic cells (DC), which express both FPR class receptors and CCR5. Since DCs present in human mucosal tissues are implicated as a major target cell for HIV, molecules of the invention can be deleivered to the mucosal tissues (e.g., anal-vaginal mucosa) so as to reduce the risk of HIV transmission. These pharmaceuticals can be delivered by any conventional route including, but not limited to, transdermal, topical, parenteral, gastrointestinal, transbronchial, and transalveolar. A preferred application concerns the use of binding partners in a coating for medical devices. Embodiments of the invention also include biotechnological tools, prophylactics, therapeutics, and methods of use of the foregoing, for the study, treatment, and prevention of HIV infection and the induction of a host immune response to a pathogen. </p>[0044] In a first group of experiments, it was found that the classic chemotactic factor, the bacterial chemotactic peptide N-formyl-methionyl-leucylphenylalanine (fMLP), rapidly induced serine phosphorylation and downregulation of CCR5. The binding of fMLP to an FPR class receptor also resulted in significant attenuation of cell responses to CCR5 ligands and the inhibition of HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein-mediated fusion and infection of cells expressing CD4, CCR5, and FPR. In a second group of experiments, it was found that a synthetic peptide domain derived from the V3 region of the HIV-1 gp120 activates an FPR class receptor. By binding to an FPR class receptor, the V3 peptide induced phagocyte chemotaxis and serine phosphorylation of CCR5. Additionally, it was discovered that other FPR class receptor ligands including SAA and T20 induce the phosphorylation of CCR5. In another group of experiments, it was discovered that the synthetic leukocyte activating peptide or \u201cW peptide\u201d Trp-Lys-Tyr-Met-Val-Met (WKYMVM) (SEQ. ID. No. 1), wherein the methionine at the NH<sub>2 </sub>end is a D-type amino acid, activates an FPR class receptor and, thereby, induces a calcium flux, chemotaxis, and the inhibition of HIV infection. </p>[0045] By enhancing or inhibiting (\u201cmodulating\u201d) the induction of an FPR class receptor, cellular responses such as signal transduction, leukocyte migration, immune system response, inflammatory response, and HIV fusion, entry, and propagation can be selectively altered. Embodiments of the invention include the use of molecules that modulate the induction of an FPR class receptor. Throughout this disclosure, the term \u201cFPR class receptor\u201d refers to receptors that can be activated by fMLP and have at least 80% homology to FPR and/or FPRL1. Molecules that interact with an FPR class receptor are referred to, for the purposes of this discussion, as \u201cbinding partners for an FPR class receptor\u201d or \u201cbinding partners\u201d. Desirable binding partners of the invention interact with an FPR class receptor and, thereby, induce a host immune response to a pathogen and/or phosphorylate CCR5, downregulate the expression of CCR5, and inhibit HIV infection. </p>[0046] The use of several different binding partners for the induction of an immune response to a pathogen, the phosphorylation and downregulation of CCR5 receptors, and the inhibition of HIV infection are contemplated. For example, fMLP, V3 peptide, SAA, T20, and W peptide, and fragments or derivatives of these molecules can be provided to a subject in need to induce an immune response to a pathogen and/or to phosphorylate CCR5 receptors, downregulate the expression of CCR5 receptors, and inhibit HIV infection. Chemicals and peptidomimetics that resemble FPR class receptor ligands or fragments thereof and protease stable derivatives of the FPR class receptor ligands or fragments thereof can also be used to induce a host immune response to a pathogen and/or phosphorylate and downregulate expression of the CCR5 receptor and inhibit HIV infection. </p>[0047] Further, methods are provided that allow for the identification of additional binding partners that induce a host immune response to a pathogen and/or phosphorylate and downregulate expression of the CCR5 receptor and inhibit HIV infection. One approach involves the use of techniques in rational drug design. Accordingly, molecules that resemble identified binding partners, and fragments or derivatives of these molecules, are designed and created using computer based homology searching, protein modeling, and combinatorial chemistry. For example, a database comprising nucleic acid or protein sequences corresponding to fMLP, V3 peptide, SAA, T20, or W peptide, or fragments or derivatives of these molecules are accessed by a search program that compares the sequence to other sequences in publicly o",
    "gainst molecules present in a combinatorial library so as to identify candidate binding partners. These candidate ligands can then be contacted to cells that express CD4, CCR5, and an FPR class receptor and the ability of the binding partner to phosphorylate CCR5, downregulate CCR5 expression, and/or inhibt HIV infection can be determined. Alternatively, cells that express CD4, CCR5, and an FPR class receptor can be contacted with molecules from a combinatorial library without first identifying a class of candidate binding partners by using a multimeric support having an FPR class receptor. </p>[0050] Further, two hybrid systems (e.g., yeast or mammalian two-hybrid approaches) can be exploited to identify binding partners. For example, a first fusion protein having a DNA binding domain (e.g., Gal-4) joined to an FPR class receptor and a second fusion protein having random peptides joined to an activating protein (e.g., VP-16) can be created. Constructs encoding these fusion proteins can be transfected into cells that have a template DNA comprised of one or more Gal-4 binding sites, a minimal promoter, and a reporter molecule (e.g, Green Fluorescent Protein or \u201cGFP\u201d). If the random peptide joined to the activating protein corresponds to a binding partner, then a reporter signal will be detected. By using a combination of rational drug design and high throughput techniques, several binding partners that induce phosphorylation of CCR5, downregulation of CCR5 expression, and the inhibition of HIV infection can be identified. </p>[0051] Therapeutic and prophylactic formulations having binding partners are also embodiments of the invention. These pharmaceuticals can be delivered by any conventional routes including, but not limited to, transdermal, parenteral, gastrointestinal, transbronchial, and transalveolar. In addition to the active ingredients mentioned above, the pharmaceutical embodiments can comprise carriers, proteins, supports, adjuvants, or components that facilitate or enhance drug delivery. A preferred application concerns the use of binding partners in a coating for medical devices including, but not limited to, gloves, vaginal instruments, and condoms. </p>[0052] The pharmaceutical embodiments can be employed in therapeutic protocols for induction of an immune response to a pathogen and/or the treatment and prevention of HIV infection. By one approach, a subject in need of an agent that interacts with an FPR class receptor and, thereby, induces a host immune response to a pathogen is identified and said subject is provided a therapeutically sufficient amount of V3 peptide or W peptide. By another approach a subject in need of an agent that inhibits HIV infection is identified and said subject is provided a therapeutically effective amount of a binding partner for an FPR class receptor. Similarly, an approach to treat and prevent HIV infection is provided in which a subject at risk of contracting an HIV infection or a subject already aff",
    "hat fMLP can inhibt HIV infection is provided. </p>[0063] fMLP-Induced Activation of FPR Class Receptors Inhibits HIV Infection </p>[0064] Experiments that sought to determine whether activation of an FPR class receptor can effect HIV-1 envelope fusion and HIV-1 infection were conducted as follows. The FPR class receptor, FPR, was stably transfected into the human osteosarcoma cell line (HOS), which already expressed both CD4 and CCR5. After transfection with FPR, the cells migrated and mobilized Ca<sup>2+</sup> in response to both fMLP and CCR5 agonists. In addition, treatment of HOS/CD4/CCR5 cells co-expressing FPR with fMLP or MIP-1\u03b1 induced an increase in phosphorylation of CCR5 (FIG. 5A), establishing that both CCR5 and FPR were functionally expressed in these cells. In the presence or absence of FPR, the HOS/CD4/CCR5 cells supported HIV-1BAL-env-mediated fusion (FIG. 5B), as assessed by a quantitative \u03b2-galactosidase gene activation assay system using recombinant vaccinia virus expressing monocyte tropic HIV-1BAL-env or the reporter gene. </p>[0065] HIV-1 env fusion was inhibited by CCR5-specific chemokines. Additionally, fMLP markedly inhibited HIV-1BAL-env-mediated fusion in cells co-expressing FPR, but not in the cells expressing CD4 and CCR5 only. The effect of fMLP on HIV-1 env-mediated fusion with FPR-expressing cells was rapid, since simultaneous addition of fMLP into the fusion assay system with env-expressing cells significantly inhibited fusion (FIG. 5B). The inhibition of HIV-1 env fusion with blood monocytes in the presence of fMLP was also observed (FIG. 5C). It was also confirmed that in both FPR-transfected HOS cells and in peripheral blood monocyte/macrophages, treatment with fMLP significantly reduced the fusion and infection of the cells by monocyte tropic strains of HIV-1, as measured by syncytia formation and p24 production. (FIG. 5D). These results establish that the rapidly increased phosphorylation of CCR5 induced by fMLP effectively impaired the capacity of CCR5 to act as an HIV-1 fusion co-receptor. </p>[0066] The results from these initial experiments provide evidence that the expression and critical functions of the chemokine receptor CCR5 can be suppressed by a ligand for an FPR class receptor. The results establish that CCR5 in monocytes is a target of FPR activation-induced phosphorylation and that this rapid and progressively increased level of CCR5 phosphorylation is accompanied by down-regulation of the surface expression and function of CCR5 in monocytes. These results above also underscore the important role of FPR in an orchestration of multiple leukocyte chemoattractants at sites of local inflammation. Significantly, the expression and function of CCR5 can be downregulated by peptides that use an unrelated receptor. These observations spurred further investigations to identify more ligands for FPR class receptors that induce phosphorylation of CCR5, downregulation of CCR5 expression, and inhibition of HIV infection. The section below provides a discussion of the experiments that revealed that the \u201cV3 peptide\u201d can induce a host immune response to a pathogen. </p>[0067] The V3 Peptide can Induce a Host Immune Response to a Pathogen </p>[0068] The V3 region of HIV-1 gp120 is thought to play a major role in determining cell tropism of the HIV-1. (O'Brien et al., Nature (London), 348:69 (1990); (Sakaida et al., J. Virol., 72:9763 (1998); Shioda et al., Nature (London), 349:167 (1991); Hwang et al., Science, 253:71 (1991); and Berger, AIDS 11 (suppl A):S3 (1997)). Initially, the ability of synthetic V3 peptides to interact directly with the viral fusion co-factors such as CCR5 and CXCR4 was determined. Synthetic V3 domains, either linear or cyclized, of the T-tropic HIV strains IIIB and EL1, have been reported to directly bind CXCR4 and induce migration of both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes. A synthetic V3 peptide domain derived from the MN strain of the HIV-1 was tested and it was found that this V3 peptide was a potent chemoattractant for human monocytes and neutrophils (FIG. 6A) but was a weak chemoattractant for T lymphocytes. Since the chemotaxis response of human phagocytes to V3 peptide was inhibited by preincubation of the cells with pertussis toxin (FIG. 6B), it was realized that this V3 peptide activated G protein coupled STM receptor(s). </p>[0069] While trying to characterize the nature of the receptor(s) used by this V3 peptide, it ",
    ", the minimal effective concentration for fMLP to induce Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization in FPRL1 transfected cells (FPRL1/293 cells) was in the \u03bcM range (FIG. 13E). The W peptide also induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization in cells transfected with either of these FPR class receptors (FIG. 13B and F). The minimal effective doses for W peptide to activate both FPR and FPRL1, however, were at 10<sup>\u221211 </sup>M, which demonstrates that W peptide activates these receptors with higher efficiency than fMLP. </p>[0082] This finding was further supported by cross-desensitization of Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux between W peptide and fMLP in both receptor transfectants. As shown in FIG. 13G and H, although sequential stimulation of the cells expressing FPRL1 with W peptide and fMLP resulted in bidirectional desensitization, a 10<sup>5 </sup>fold excess of fMLP was required to desensitize the effect of W peptide in FPRL1/293 cells. Likewise, in ETFR cells, with equal concentrations, W peptide more potently desensitized the effect of fMLP. (FIG. 13C and D). In control experiments, W peptide and fMLP did not induce Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization in parental or mock transfected rat basophil cell line and HEK 293 cells. These results provide evidence that W peptide activates both FPR and FPRL1 receptors with high potency. </p>[0083] The ability of W peptide to induce migration of cells transfected with FPR or FPRL1 was also tested. FPRL1/293 cells showed a marked migratory response to W peptide with an EC50 of \u02dc1 pM (FIG. 14A and B), but these cells failed to migrate in response to a wide concentration range of fMLP (FIG. 14A and B). On the other hand, both fMLP and W peptide induced the migration of the ETFR cells with comparable dose-response curves (FIG. 14A and C). These chemotaxis experiments demonstrate that fMLP is only a partial and low affinity agonist for FPRL1 since it does not induce migration of FPRL1 expressing cells. W peptide, on the other hand, was found to be a very efficient agonist for both FPR and FPRL1, with even higher efficacy for FPRL1 than FPR; as low picomolar concentrations of W peptide are sufficient to induce both Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux and chemotaxis in these cells. </p>[0084] As observed with phagocytic cells, the W peptide induced migration of FPRL1/293 (FIG. 14D) and ETFR cells was inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin. To further confirm that W peptide shares receptors with fMLP, ligand binding competition experiments with <sup>3</sup>H-labeled fMLP were performed. In agreement with the chemotactic and Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization activity for the ETFR cells, W peptide effectively competed with <sup>3</sup>H-fMLP for binding to ETFR cells (FIG. 15). <sup>3</sup>H-fMLP did not significantly bind to FPRL1/293 cells, presumably due to its low affinity for FPRL1. The results presented in this section demonstrate that W peptide can induce chemotaxis and Ca<sup>+2 </sup>mobilization, cellular events associated with a host imm",
    "uces cellular events associated with a host immune response to a pathogen, experiments were performed to determine whether W peptide can inhibit HIV infection. The FPR class receptor, FPRL1, was stably transfected into the human osteosarcoma cell line (HOS), which already expressed both CD4 and CCR5. Hos cells expressing CD4/CCR5/FPRL1 receptors were first treated with W peptide at designated concentrations for 1 hour follwed by infection with HIV-1<sub>JRFL </sub>for one hour. The infected cells were washed three times with medium and placed in culture. The levels of p24 were measured by ELISA at 48 hours and 72 hours post-infection. FIG. 16A shows that exposure of W peptide [10<sup>\u22125</sup>M] at the initial step of HIV-1 infection significantly reduced HIV-1 infectivity in FPRL1 transfectants but not mock transfected cells. W peptide was found to reduce HIV-1 infectivity at concentrations as low as 10<sup>\u221211</sup>M. FIG. 16B. In accordance with the HIV infectivity experiments performed in the presence of fMLP, W peptide effectively inhibited the propagation of HIV. These results also establish that ligands that interact with either FPR or FPRL1 can inhibt HIV infection. </p>[0087] W peptide was derived from a biologically active peptide WKYMVM-NH<sub>2 </sub>(SEQ. ID. No. 1). isolated from a peptide library. (Seo et al., J. Immunol., 158:1895-1901 (1997)). WKYMVM-NH<sub>2 </sub>(SEQ. ID. No. 1) stimulates phosphoinositide hydrolysis in a human B cell line and based on its inhibition by pertussis toxin, the usage of a Gi protein coupled, STM receptor was postulated. (Baek et al., J. Biol. Chem., 271:8170-8175 (1996)). A modification of the methionine at the NH<sub>2 </sub>end with D-type amino acid yielded WKYMVM (\u201cW peptide\u201d SEQ. ID. No. 1), which exhibited more than a hundred fold increase in its biological effect than its prototype WKYMYM-NH<sub>2 </sub>(SEQ. ID. No. 4) and stimulated a variety of STM, G-protein receptor mediated signaling events in human monocytes (Bae et al., J. Leuko. Bio., 65:241-248 (1999)) and neutrophils (Seo et al., J. Immunol., 158:1895-1901 (1997)) in addition to B lymphocytes. </p>[0088] The combined results from the experiments above provide evidence that activation of FPR class receptors (e.g., either FPR and FPRL1) by several different ligands induces the phosphorylation of CCR5, the downregulation of CCR5, and the inhibition of HIV infection. More specifically, the data above has shown that fMLP, T20, V3 peptide, and SAA activate FPR class receptors and, thereby, phosphorylate CCR5. The data above also has shown that phosphorylation of CCR5 results in the downregulation of CCR5 from the cell surface and an attenuation of signaling through CCR5 by chemokines. Furthermore, the data above has shown that fMLP can inihibit HIV-1 infection by interacting with FPR and W peptide can inhibit HIV-1 infection by interacting with FPRL1. It is therefore contemplated that several ligands, which interact with FPR class receptors, can activate these receptors to transduce a signal that results in phosphorylation of CCR5, which in turn, downregulates CCR5 from the cell surface resulting in an inhibition of fusion and, thus, propagation of HIV-1. </p>[0089] Although early studies indicated that the N-formyl group present on fMLP was essential for optimal agonist potency, recent studies have shown that non-formylated peptides can also bind and activate FPR. (Freer et al., Biochemistry, 21:257 (1982); Higgins et al., J Med Chem, 39:1013 (1996); both references are herein incorporated by reference). The synthetic pentapeptide Met-Ile-Leu-Phe-Phe-OH (SEQ. ID. No. 2), either N-formylated or N-acetylated, is more potent than parental fMLP in the induction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux in human neutrophils, for example. (Murphy. Annu Rev Immunol, 12:593 (1994); Murphy, \u201cThe N-formyl peptide chemotactic receptors,\u201d Chemoattractant ligands and their receptors, CRC Press, Boca Raton, 1996:269; Prossnitz and Ye, Pharmacol Ther, 74:73 (1997); both references are herein incorporated by reference). Amino terminal urea-substituted and carbomate-modified peptides are also efficacious agonists for the FPR. (Higgins et al., J Med Chem, 39:1013 (1996), herein incorporated by reference). The results above also established that molecules that do not bear any sequence identity to the reported FPR agonists, such as T20/DP178, V3 peptide, and W peptide are effective at inhibiting HIV infection. Moreover, several peptides derived from a plasmid based random library have been shown also to be highly efficacious agonists for FPRL1. (Klein et al., Nat. Biotechnol., 16:1334-1337 (1998)). </p>[0090] ",
    " or a fragment or derivative of these molecules can be compared to known sequences on a protein basis. Protein sequences corresponding to fMLP, V3 peptide, SAA, T20, and W peptide, or a fragment or derivative of these molecules are compared, for example, to known amino acid sequences found in Swissprot release 35, PIR release 53 and Genpept release 108 public databases using BLASTP with the parameter W=8 and allowing a maximum of 10 matches. In addition, the protein sequences encoding these binding partners are compared to publicly known amino acid sequences of Swissprot using BLASTX with the parameter E=0.001. The candidate ligands desirably have at least 50% homology and preferably have 60% or 70% or 80% or 90% or greater homology to fMLP, V3 peptide, SAA, T20, or W peptide. The candidatebinding partners can have the following degrees of homology to fMLP, V3 peptide, SAA, T20, or W peptide, for example: 50%, 51%, 52%, 53%, 54%, 55%, 56%, 57%, 58%, 59%, 60%, 61%, 62%, 63%, 64%, 65%, 66%, 67%, 68%, 69%, 70%, 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, and 99%. The candidate binding partners having greater than or equal to 50% homology are identified and are subsequently examined using a binding partner characterization assay. Binding partners that can activate an FPR class receptor and thereby, induce a host immune response to a pathogen and/or induce a phosphorylation of CCR5 and inhibition of HIV infection can then be identified. </p>[0109] In another embodiment, computer modeling and the sequence-to-structure-to-function paradigm is exploited to identify more binding partners that induce a host immune response to a pathogen and/or induce a phosphorylation of CCR5 and inhibition of HIV infection. By this approach, first the structure of a binding partner having a known response in a binding partner characterization assay is determined from its sequence using a threading algorithm, which aligns the sequence to the best matching structure in a structural database. Next, the protein's active site (i.e., the site important for a desired response in the characterization assay) is identified and a \u201cfuzzy functional form\u201d (FFF)\u2014a three-dimensional descriptor of the active site of a protein\u2014is created. (See e.g., Fetrow et al., J. Mol. Biol 282:703-711 (1998) and Fetrow and Skolnick, J. Mol. Biol. 281: 949-968 (1998). </p>[0110] The FFFs are built by iteratively superimposing the protein geometries from a series of functionally related proteins with known structures. The FFFs are not overly specific, however, and the degree to which the descriptors can be relaxed is explored. In essence, conserved and functionally important residues for a desired response are identified and a set of geometric and conformational constraints for a specific function are defined in the form of a computer algorithm. The program then searches experimentally determined protein structures from a protein structural database for sets of residues that satisfy the specified constraints. In this manner, homologous three-dimensional structures can be compared and degrees (e.g., percentages of three-dimensional homology) can be ascertained. The ability to search three-dimensiona",

Several other groups have developed databases of short sequence patterns or motifs designed to identify a given function or activity of a protein. Many of these databases, notably Prosite (http://expasy.hcuge.ch/sprot/prosite.html); Blocks (http://www.blocks.fhcrc.org); Prints (http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/dbbrowser/PRINTS/PRINTS.html), the Molecular Modelling Database (MMDB), and the Protein Data Bank can use short stretches of sequence information to identify sequence patterns that are specific for a given function; thus they avoid the problems arising from the necessity of matching entire sequences. In this manner, new binding partners are rationally selected for further identification by binding partner characterization assays, as described above. Rounds or cycles of functional assays on the molecules and derivatives thereof and further FFF refinement and database searching allows an investigator to more narrowly define classes of binding partners that produce a desired level of induction of a host immune response to a pathogen and/or phosphorylation of CCR5 and inhibition of HIV infection. </p>[0112] By a similar approach, a binding partner that interacts with an FPR class receptor can be identified and manufactured as follows. First, a molecular model of one or more known binding partners or portions of these molecules that interact with an FPR class receptor are created using one of the techniques discussed above or as known in the art. Next, chemical libraries and databases are searched for molecules similar in structure to the known binding partner. That is, a search can be made of a three dimensional data base for non-peptide (organic) structures (e.g., non-peptide analogs, and/or dipeptide analogs) having three dimensional similarity to the known structure of the target compound. See, e.g., the Cambridge Crystal Structure Data Base, Crystallographic Data Center, Lensfield Road, Cambridge, CB2 1EW, England; and Allen, F. H., et al., Acta Crystallogr., B35: 2331-2339 (1979). </p>[0113] It is noted that search algorithms for three dimensional data base comparisons are available in the literature. See, e.g., Cooper, et al., J. Comput.-Aided Mol. Design, 3: 253-259 (1989) and references cited therein; Brent, et al., J. Comput.-Aided Mol. Design, 2: 311-310 (1988) and references cited therein. Commercial software for such searches is also available from vendors such as Day Light Information Systems, Inc., Irvine, Calif. 92714, and Molecular Design Limited, 2132 Faralton Drive, San Leandro, Calif. 94577. The searching is done in a sy",
    " appropriate length of linker that allows for an optimal cellular response or lack thereof, can be determined by screening the ligands with varying linkers in the assays detailed in the present disclosure. </p>[0131] In other embodiments of the invention, the multimeric and composite supports discussed above can have attached multimerized ligands so as to create a \u201cmultimerized-multimeric support\u201d and a \u201cmultimerized-composite support\u201d, respectively. A multimerized ligand can, for example, be obtained by coupling two or more binding partners in tandem using conventional techniques in molecular biology. The multimerized form of the ligand can be advantageous for many applications because of the ability to obtain an agent with a better ability induce a host immune response to a pathogen and/or inhibit HIV infection. The incorporation of linkers or spacers, such as flexible \u03bb linkers, between the individual domains that make-up the multimerized agent can also be advantageous for some embodiments. The insertion of \u03bb linkers of an appropriate length between protein binding domains, for example, can encourage greater flexibility in the molecule and can overcome steric hindrance. Similarly, the insertion of linkers between the multimerized ligand and the support can encourage greater flexibility and limit steric hindrance presented by the support. The determination of an appropriate length of linker that allows for an optimal induction of a host immune response to a pathogen and/or inhibition of HIV infection, can be determined by screening the binding partners with varying linkers in the assays detailed in this disclosure. </p>[0132] In preferable embodiments, the various types of supports discussed above are created using fMLP, W peptide, V3 peptide, T20, SAA, or fragments, derivatives, or modifications thereof or a peptidomimetic that resembles these molecules. Additionally, preferred multimeric supports include supports having FPR or FPRL1. The multimeric supports, composite supports, multimerized-multimeric supports, or multimerized-composite supports having a binding partner are collectively referred to as \u201csupport-bound binding partners\u201d. The multimeric supports, composite supports, multimerized-multimeric supports, or multimerized-composite supports, having an FPR class receptor are referred to as \u201csupport-bound receptors\u201d. </p>[0133] The support-bound binding partners and support-bound receptors can be used as biotechnological tools in rational drug design and approaches in dynamic combinatorial chemistry. (See e.g., Angnew, Chem. Int. Ed., 37:2828 (1998)). For example, a target biomolecule, such as an FPR class receptor, is joined to a support and is bound by the candidate binding partners from the libraries generated by the rational drug design approaches described above or by candidate binding partners obtained from a random combinatorial chemistry library. The FPR class receptor-containing resin that is bound with one or more candidate bind",

Coatings suitable for use in medical devices can be provided by a gel or powder containing the binding partners or by polymeric coating into which the binding partners are suspended. Suitable polymeric materials for coatings or devices are those that are physiologically acceptable and through which a therapeutically effective amount of the binding partner can diffuse. Suitable polymers include, but are not limited to, polyurethane, polymethacrylate, polyamide, polyester, polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyvinyl-chloride, cellulose acetate, silicone elastomers, collagen, silk, etc. Such coatings are described, for instance, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,612,337, issued Sep. 16, 1986 to Fox et al. that is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. </p>[0162] In several aspects of the invention, binding partners, in particular pharmaceuticals having binding partners, are provided to a subject in need of an agent that interacts with an FPR class receptor so as to induce a host immune response to a pathogen. In other embodiments, pharmaceuticals having binding partners are provided to subjects in need of an agent that inhibits HIV infection. Methods to formulate pharmaceuticals for the induction of a host immune response to a pathogen and/or the inhibition of HIV are embodiments of the invention. </p>[0163] One embodiment, for example, concerns a method of inducing a host immune response to a pathogen in a subject. Accordingly, a subject in need of an agent that interacts with an FPR class receptor and, thereby, induces a host iummune response is identified and said subject is provided a therapeutically sufficient amount of V3 peptide or W peptide. Such subjects in need can include individuals afflicted with chronic pathogenic infection (e.g., chronic viral disease, bacterial disease, or fungal disease). These individuals can be identified by clinical or biochemical techniques. </p>[0164] Other embodiments involve methods to treat or prevent HIV infection. By one approach, a subject in need of an agent that inhibits HIV infection is identified and said subject is provided a therapeutically sufficient amount of a binding partner. Such subjects in need can include individuals at risk of contracting HIV infection or are already afflicted with HIV infection. These individuals can be identified by clinical or biochemical techniques. In the section below, several examples that detail the materials and methods that were used in many of the experiments are provided. </p>EXAMPLE 1 fMLP Experiments [0165] CCR5 Phosphorylation </p>[0166] Monocytes were isolated by counter-flow elutriation from the peripheral blood of normal donors (NIH Clinical Center, Transfusion Medicine Department, Bethesda, Md.) and enriched for mononuclear"
