In some embodiments, the individual is a human. </p>[0163] Any of the antigen binding domains, antibodies, and antibody fragments of the present disclosure (e.g, as described supra in section I) may find use in the methods of treatment and uses disclosed herein, as well as the compositions (e.g, pharmaceutical compositions) related thereto. For example, in some embodiments, the methods include using a multispecific (e.g, bispecific) binding molecule of the present disclosure with a first antigen binding domain that binds to human Dectin- 1, and a second antigen binding domain that binds to a disease-causing agent. In some embodiments, the disease-causin",
    "ctin- 1 isoform B protein, with one boost of antigen per week. The antibodies generated from this immunization have a human variable domain and a mouse constant domain. </p>[0185] From the 56 candidate anti-Dectin-1 antibody clones generated in this study, the 2M24 clone was the only one that showed binding to both Dectin- 1 isoforms A and B in HEK cells as well as to monocytes. As shown in FIG. 1A, the 2M24 anti-Dectin-1 antibody clone demonstrated high affinity to Dectin- 1 expressing human monocytes. In contrast, other clones bound only to Dectin-1 isoform A (e.g., 2M08, 2M12, 2M38) or showed no binding at all (2M49). Moreover, the affinity to Dectin-1 of2M24 was superior to the affinity presented by other clones and the commercial Dectin-1 antibodies (15E2, 259931, GE2). FIG. 1C shows a comparison of the binding to human monocytes and HEK cells overexpressing Dectin-1 between 2M24 clone and other Dectin-1 clones identified from the Alloy transgenic mice immunization, as well as commercial Dectin-1 clones. </p>[0186] The 2M24 antibody was also assessed for its cross-reactivity to cynomolgus Dectin-1. The binding was assessed by flow cytometry analysis of cynomolgus monkey monocytes derived from PBMCs. As shown in FIG. IB, anti-human Dectin-1 clone 2M24 antibody demonstrated cross-reactivity and high affinity to cynomolgus monkey Dectin-1 expressed on monocytes. The 2M24 anti-Dectin-1 antibody was superior to commercial antibodies tested in terms of affinity, exhibiting an EC50 of 0.3 nM. The agonistic 15E2 and the 255931 commercial antibodies exhibited EC50 of 14 nM andl6 nM, respectively, in cynomolgus monkey monocytes. FIG. 1C shows a comparison of binding to cynomolgus monkey monocytes between 2M24 clone and the commercial clones 15E2 and 259931. </p>[0187] To assess the functionality of the 2M24 Dectin-1 antibody in promoting phagocytosis, polystyrene beads were coated with the 2M24 antibody and mixed with HEK-Blue hDectin-la cells or primary human monocytes. The 2M24 antibody efficiently induced the phagocytosis of the beads. As shown in FIGs. 2A-2B, the 2M24 anti-Dectin-1 antibody coupled to polystyrene beads promoted phagocytosis in both HEK-Blue hDectin-la cells and human primary monocytes. [0188] From the mlgGl 2M24 clone, a fully human 2M24 antibody of the IgG4 isotype was developed. This antibody has human constant and variable regions. The functionality of the \n\nhIgG4 2M24 was then assessed for binding to two Dectin- 1 expressing cell types, HEK-Blue hDectin-la cells and human monocytes. As shown in FIGs. 3A-3B, the fully human 2M24 showed high affinity binding to Dectin- 1 in transfected HEK cells (EC50 = 1.6 nM) and human monocytes (EC50 = 0.7 nM). </p>[0189] Next, the h!gG4 2M24 antibody was tested for its ability to promote phagocytosis of beads in Dectin- 1 expressing cells. As shown in FIG. 4, the h!gG42M24 antibody exhibited efficient phagocytic ability in HEK cells overexpressing Dectin- 1, human monocytes, and human macrophages. Thus, the fully human IgG4 2M24 antibody can promote phagocytosis in Dectin- 1 expressing cells. </p>[0190] The fully human 2M24 (h!gG4) anti-Dectin-1 antibody was also tested for its ability to promote signaling through Dectin- 1. Activation of Dectin- 1 signaling by the antibodies can be assessed with a secreted alkaline phosphatase assay using HEK-Blue hDectin-la cells. The HEK- Blue hDectin-la cells have been engineered to express Dectin- 1 isoform A and genes involved in the Dectin- 1/NF-KB/SEAP signaling pathway and thus express a secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) in response to stimulation by Dectin- 1 ligands. As shown in FIGs. 5A-5B, the 2M24 (h!gG4) anti-Dectin-1 antibody induced alkaline phosphatase secretion in HEK-Blue hDectin-la cells both in immobilized form and conjugated to beads. These observations support the idea that the 2M24 (h!gG4) antibody promotes SEAP secretion by engaging Dectin- 1 on the surface of the cells, indicating clustering of the receptor and an agonistic activity by this antibody. Moreover, efficient clustering signaling of Dectin- 1 can be promoted by beads conjugated to 2M24 (h!gG4). Signaling was better induced with bigger beads, ",
    "of-of-concept to engage a Dectin-1 antibody (15E2 or 2M24) and a target antibody, a click-chemistry approach was used to develop bispecifics comprising an anti-Dectin-1 -targeting arm and a second arm targeting a protein of interest. This approach enabled the generation of bispecifics for various assays. A schematic of this approach is shown in FIGs. 10A-10B. As binding of Dectin-1 by Dectin-1- specific antibodies can induce phagocytosis of targets (see Example 1 and Example 2), the bispecific antibodies were evaluated for their ability to promote phagocytosis of specific target cells. First, the bispecifics were evaluated for their ability to eliminate CD70-expressing cancer cells by phagocytosis. CD70 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that belongs to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily. CD70 is expressed at low levels in normal tissues, but is highly overexpressed in various diseases, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), renal cell carcinoma, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. </p>[0201] Using click chemistry, a bispecific molecule comprising a Dectin-1 -targeting arm (anti- Dectin-1; clone 2M24) and a CD70-targeting arm (anti-hCD70; clone 113-16) was generated. The purity of the bispecific (2M24/anti-hCD70) antibody was assessed by SDS-PAGE analysis (FIG. 12A), while binding was assessed by flow cytometry analysis (FIG. 12B). As shown in FIG. 12B, binding studies on cells revealed that 2M24/anti-hCD70 bound to the HEK293 cell line expressing Dectin-1 with an EC50 of 1.8 nM and bound to CD70-positive renal carcinoma cell lines with an EC50 of 12.34 nM (A498 cells) or 11.62 nM (786-0 cells). The bispecific was then evaluated for its ability to induce cell coupling. As shown in FIG. 13, the 2M24/anti-hCD70 bispecific induced coupling of Dectin-1 -expressing HEK293 cells and CD70-expressing renal carcinoma cells, resulting in cell doublets of HEK293 cells (labeled with calcein green) and A498 cells (labeled with calcein red). </p>[0202] Next, targeting of CD20-expressing cells with a bispecific was evaluated. CD20 is a transmembrane protein present on virtually all B cells from the stage at which they become committed to B-cell development until it is downregulated when they differentiate into antibodysecreting plasma cells and is considered a pan-B-cell antigenic marker. As shown in FIGs. 14A- 14B, a 2M24/anti-hCD20 bispecific induced coupling of Dectin-1 -expressing cells (both Dectin- 1 -expressing HEK293 cells and human M0 macrophages) with CD20-expressing B cells (Raji cell line). This cell-to-cell coupling mediated by the bispecific could induce synapse formation between effector and target cell that may alter cytokine signaling, activate phagocytosis and ultimately target antigen presentation. </p>[0203] To test for induction of signaling resulting from stimulation with bispecific antibodies that bind Dectin-1, a secreted alkaline phosphatase assay was performed. As shown in FIG. 15, \n\nRaji cells coated with an anti-Dectin-l/anti-CD20 bispecific induced alkaline phosphatase secretion in HEK-Blue hDecti",

To monitor phagocytosis by flow cytometry, HEK cells overexpressing Dectin-1 were incubated with biotin beads conjugated to Fab 2M24-mSA for 30 minutes on ice \n\nor at 37 \u00b0C for 30 minutes, followed by washing with PBS twice. Phagocytosis was assessed by detecting activated Phrodo red within the HEK cell/beads duplet population by flow cytometry in the PE channel using a CytoFlex flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Atlanta, GA). </p>Results </p>[0210] To enable the efficient generation of bispecific antibodies, a novel strategy was developed which utilizes the high affinity interaction of streptavidin and biotin. A monomeric streptavidin (mSA) construct was fused to the Fc-domain of 2M24, or CHI domain of Fab 2M24. The recombinant fusion proteins were incubated with various biotinylated antibodies of interest to assemble the bispecifics. A schematic of this strategy is shown in FIGs. 19A-19B. </p>[0211] This fusion technology enables the high-throughput generation and screening of bispecific antibodies. To test this approach, a Fab 2M24-mSA fusion protein was generated and purified. As shown in FIGs. 20A-20C, the Fab 2M24-mSA fusion showed high affinity binding (EC50 = 1.45 nM) to Dectin-1 expressing cells. This Fab 2M24-mSA fusion protein can be combined with various biotinylated antibodies against targets of interests. Moreover, the Fab 2M24-mSA fusion also induced binding and phagocytosis of beads by Dectin-1 -expressing HEK 293 cells (FIGs. 21A-21B), indicating that the Fab version of the 2M24 antibody can efficiently promote phagocytosis in cells expressing Dectin-1. </p>[0212] Using the anti-Dectin-1 -streptavidin fusion, bispecifics against various targets (e.g., CD20, CD19, CD70, amyloid B (1-42)) were developed. As shown in FIGs. 22A-22D, these bispecifics showed high homogeneity based on HPLC analysis. These data demonstrate robust feasibility of this technology for bispecific antibody generation. </p>[0213] Next, the anti-Dectin-1 bispecifics generated using the Fab 2M24-mSA fusion protein were evaluated for their ability to induce cell coupling. As shown in FIG. 23, the Fab 2M24- mSA/biotin anti-hCD20 bispecific induced coupling of Dectin-1 -expressing HEK293 cells and CD20-expressing B cells (Raji cell line). This interaction can promote Dectin-1 clustering, which induces cytokine secretion by effector cells, triggers phagocytosis of target cells, and leads to neo-antigen presentation and activation of adaptive immune cells (B and T-cells). </p>Example 4: Targeted phagocytosis of amyloid deposits using anti-Dectin-1 bispecific antibodies </p>[0214] This example describes the use of bispecific antibodies that bind Dectin-",
    "vels of remaining live, CD 19+ B cells (reported as a % of B cells in isotype control-treated PBMCs). Thus, in two healthy donors, high concentrations of 2M24/CD20 bispecific antibody induced superior B cell depletion (-80% reduction) compared to Rituximab (-40% reduction), despite the bivalent binding nature of Rituximab and -10-fold difference in binding affinity (as shown in FIG. 33B). The unique mechanism of action of 2M24/CD20 active IgGl, which involves binding to Dectin- 1 on myeloid cells, Fey receptors on NK cells and monocytes, and CD20 on target B cells (FIG. 32B), leads to an overall superior depletion of B cells compared to Rituximab. These data support the concept that Dectin- 1 induced immune stimulation via 2M24/CD20 bispecific enhances depletion of the target cells. </p>[0249] Ability of 2M24/CD20 hlgGl (active isotype) bispecific antibody or Rituximab (hlgGl) to downregulate CD 19 expression on B cells in a process known as shaving or trogocytosis was assessed. Expression of CD 19+ on B cells from two healthy donors - donor 83 (FIG. 37A) and donor 84 (FIG. 37B) - was quantified by flow cytometry following a 24-hour incubation with increasing concentration of 2M24/CD20 hlgGl (active isotype) bispecific antibody, Rituximab, or isotype controls. The mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) for CD19 staining using anti-CD19 (BV605 conjugated) was used to evaluate the effect of 2M24/CD20 bispecific and Rituximab on CD19 expression on B cells. In PBMCs from donor 83, the EC50 with respect to CD19 expression was 0.014nM for rituximab and 0.080nM for 2M24/CD20 hlgGl bispecific (FIG. 37A). In PBMCs from donor 84, the EC50 with respect to CD19 expression was 0.013nM for rituximab and 0.090nM for 2M24/CD20 hlgGl bispecific (FIG. 37B). Both 2M24/CD20 active IgGl bispecific Ab and Rituximab led to downregulation of CD 19 expression on B cells. \n\nInterestingly, Rituximab demonstrated at least five-fold more potent shaving compared to 2M24/CD20 bispecific Ab. Downregulation of target CD20 on B cells was previously reported as a mechanism by which malignant B cells escape Rituximab-mediated depletion (Beum, P.V. et al. (2006) J. Immunol. 176:2600-2609). These findings therefore suggest that 2M24/CD20 active IgGl bispecific may be superior in depleting B-cells as compared to Rituximab due to reduced shaving potential. </p>[0250] Immune stimulation triggered by 2M24/CD20 active IgGl bispecific antibody led to secretion of a unique repertoire of cytokines compared to Rituximab (FIG. 38). ELISA-based (mesoscale discovery) quantification of cytokines was undertaken in supernatants isolated from healthy donor PBMCs treated with 2M24/CD20 active hlgGl bispecific, Rituximab, or isotype controls. PBMCs were stimulated with antibodies overnight, and supernatants were subsequently analyzed by MSD. Cytokines tested were IFNy, IL-12p70, IL-6, TNFa, IL-1J3, IL-4, IL-13, IL- 10, and IL-8. The results indicated that 2M24/CD20 active IgGl triggered higher level and distinct cytokine activation in PBMCs compared to Rituximab. Furthermore, engagement of Dectin-1 and Fc receptor alone by the 2M24/RSV bispecific does not induce cytokine release, excluding the possibility of systemic cytokine activation. These findings highlight a unique MOA that distinguishes 2M24/CD20 active IgGl bispecific antibody from Rituximab. Without wishing to be bound to theory, these findings further indicate that 2M24/CD20 could trigger release of Thl and Th2-type of responses and promote immune stimulation of tumor microenvironment. [0251] 2M24/CD20 hlgGl (active isotype) bispecific antibody was also found to induce superior B-cell depletion and lower CD 19 shaving compared to Rituximab in co-cultures of human macrophages and GFP-expressing Raji B cells. Co-cultures of human macrophages and Raji-GFP cells (3:1 ratio) were analyzed by flow cytometry in the presence of 2M24/CD20 hlgGl (active isotype) bispecific, 2M24/RSV control, fucosylated Rituximab or isotype hlgGl control (FIG. 39A). Co-cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 hours and then stained with a PE a-CD206 Ab to label macrophages and a BV-605 a-CD19 antibody to label Raji cells. The number of the remaining live/Raji-GFP+ cells was assessed in the end of the experiment. The primary antibodies were used in a serial dose titration. CD19 was assessed on Raji-GFP cells after 24 hours (FIG. 39B), with B-cell receptor shown as the reduction in the CD 19 MFI in the presence of a-Dectin-l/a-hCD20 bispecific or Rituximab. The EC50 with respect to CD19 expression was 0.020nM for rituximab and 0.95nM for 2M24/CD20 hlgGl bispecific. These results demonstrate enhanced B-cell depletion (Fey receptor mediated) by the 2M24/CD20 bispecific antibody compared to Rituximab. Rituximab reduced the B-cell receptor CD 19 surface levels more potently than the a-Dectin-l/a-hCD20 bispecific antibody. Similarly, B-cell receptor \n\nshaving has been observed for CD20 by Rituximab, and the reduction of the CD20 limits the effectiveness of Rituximab to deplete B-cell. Without wishing to be bound to theory, it is thought that these data indicate that the superiority of the 2M24/CD20 hlgGl (active isotype) bispecific to deplete B-cells is due to the lower B-cell receptor shaving compared to Rituximab. This highlights a differential mechanism of cell depletion by 2M24/CD20 hlgGl (active isotype) bispecific. </p>[0252] B-cell depletion was also analyzed in single cell suspensions from kidney cancer tissue biopsies. Single cell suspensions from two Kidney cancer tissue biopsies were analyzed by flow cytometry in the presence of 2M24/CD20 hlgGl (active or inert) bispecific antibody, 2M24/RSV hlgGl controls, fucosylated Rituximab, and respective isotype controls. Kidney cancer tissue biopsies were dissociated to single cell suspensions and treated with primary antibodies (2 pg/ml) for 24 hours at 37\u00b0C. Immune cell populations were analyzed by flow cytometry (FIGS. 40A &amp; 40B). The number of the remaining live B cells was ass",
    "24/Trop2 bispecific antibody purified as a monodispersed molecule. 2M24/Trop2 bispecific antibody was found to bind with high affinity to Dectin- 1 -expressing HEK cells (FIG. 53B) and moderate affinity to Trop-2-expressing A431 cancer cell line (FIG. 53C). </p>[0281] To evaluate the level of Trop-2 expression on different cancer cells, cancer cell lines (A431 and SKBR3) were stained with anti -human PE Trop-2 or isotype control antibodies to evaluate Trop-2 expression. Receptor copy number was assessed by comparing the fluorescence intensity of fluorochrome-labeled microspheres with known amounts of the fluorophore to the fluorescence intensity of the labeled cells by flow cytometry. Trop-2 was found to be highly \n\nexpressed on the cancer cell lines A431 and SKBR3, with receptor copy numbers of 8.4 million and 1.1 million, respectively (FIG. 54). These results demonstrate that Trop-2 polypeptide is highly expressed on cancer cells. High expression on cancer cells makes Trop-2 an attractive antigen for the targeted-killing of cancer cells by a 2M24/Trop-2 bispecific antibody. </p>[0282] Next, binding of the 2M24/Trop-2 bispecific antibody to Trop-2-expressing cell lines was examined. Cancer cell lines (HeLa, SiHa, BxPC-3, and Capan-2) were incubated with serial dilutions of the 2M24/Trop-2 hlgGlbispecific antibody or an isotype control antibody as a single concentration (300 nM). The secondary antibody (AF647 goat Anti-Human) was used for detection by flow cytometry. Binding EC50 was determined using four-parameter logistic (4PL) non-linear regression. The results demonstrated that 2M24/Trop-2 bispecific antibody binds with variable sub-micromolar affinity to different Trop-2-expressing cell lines (FIGS. 55A-55D). [0283] 2M24/Trop-2 bispecific antibody was assayed for ability to deplete Trop-2 expressing cell lines. Macrophages were generated by monocytes cultured with MCSF for 6 days. After differentiation, macrophages were co-cultured with Trop-2-expressing cancer cell lines, SKBR3 or A431, for 24 hours in the presence of 10 ug/ml 2M24/Trop-2 hlgGl or 2M24/RSV hlgGl. To detect macrophages, PE-CD206 antibody was used. The cancer cells were detected either by prestaining with Calcein AM (FIG. 56A, SKBR3 cells) or using an APC-EPCAM antibody (FIG. 56B, A431 cells). Phagocytosis was assessed by flow cytometry as double positive PE- CD206+Calcein+ cells in the single cell gate for SKBR3 cells (FIG. 56A) or remaining EPCAM+ cells for A431 cells (FIG. 56B). The results demonstrated that 2M24/Trop-2 bispecific antibody induced robust depletion of both cancer cell lines that express Trop-2. 2M24/Trop-2 bispecific antibody induced phagocytosis of Trop-2 expressing cell lines by macrophages. The cancer cell reduction was 56% for SKBR3 (FIG. 56A) and 87% for A431 cancer cells (FIG. 56B). The data provide strong evidence that the 2M24/Trop-2 bispecific antibody can direct the macrophages to eliminate cancer cells that express Trop-2. </p>[0284] Trop-2 expre",

[0293] Nectin-4 expression was assessed in cancer cell lines SKBR3 and A431 (FIG. 61A), and in single-cell suspension of prostate or ovarian cancer biopsies (FIG. 61B). Nectin-4 was detected using an anti-Nectin-4 m!gG2b antibody and an Alexa Fluor-647-conjugated secondary antibody. An isotype m!gG2b antibody was used as a negative control for background staining. Nectin-4 expression was observed in cancer cell lines as well as cancer cells in the tumor biopsy tissues. </p>[0294] Binding of 2M24/Nectin-4 bispecific antibody to cells that express Dectin-1 or Nectin-4 was analyzed. Cell lines expressing Dectin-1 (HEK cells) or Nectin-4 (A431 cells) were incubated with serial dilutions of the 2M24/N ectin-4 hlgGl bispecific antibody or RSV hlgGl (isotype control) to assess target binding. The secondary antibody (AF647 goat Anti -human IgG) was used for detection by flow cytometry. Binding EC50 values were determined using four parameter logistic (4PL) non-linear regression. The results demonstrated that 2M24/Nectin-4 bispecific antibody bound with high affinity to Dectin-1 and low affinity to Nectin-4 (FIG. 62). \n\n[0295] Activity of the 2M24/Nectin-4 bispecific antibody was measured using an NFkB reporter assay. Schematic representation of assay setup is shown in FIG. 63 (upper). NFkB reporter HEK cells expressing Dectin-1 were incubated with A431 cancer cells in the presence of serial titration of the 2M24/N ectin-4 bispecific or bivalent anti-Nectin-4 antibody. 2M24/Nectin- 4 bispecific engages the two cell lines, promoting Dectin-1 receptor clustering and downstream activation of NFkB. Upon activation, SEAP was released into the media and used as a readout for Dectin-1 activation. Media levels of SEAP were quantified using a spectrophotometer (FIG. 63, lower). The results demonstrated robust stimulation of Dectin-1 and downstream NFkB activity by the 2M24/Nectin-4 bispecific antibody. </p>[0296] 2M24/Nectin-4 bispecific antibody was analyzed for depletion of Nectin-4-expressing cancer cells. Macrophages were generated by monocytes cultured with MCSF for 6 days. After differentiation, macrophages were co-cultured with the Nectin-4-expressing cancer cell line A431 for 24 hours in the presence of 2M24/Nectin-4 bispecific, anti-Nectin-4 bivalent parental antibody, or RSV hlgGl (isotype control).
