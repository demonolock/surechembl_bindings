    "in dry THF (100 mL) and slowly added dropwise to the reaction system. After the addition, the temperature was slowly raised to room temperature and reacted for 18 hours. After the reaction was completed, it was diluted with ethyl acetate, the organic phase was separated and washed once with saturated brine. The organic phase was dried, filtered and concentrated, and the residue was separated by silica gel column chromatography to give 1-(tert-butyl)2-methyl(R)-2-(2-(chloromethyl)allyl)-4-methylenepyrrolidine-1,2-dicarboxylate (10.3 g, yield: 63.9%).

The reaction was carried out at room temperature for 2 hours. After the reaction was completed, the mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate, and the organic phase was separated and washed once with saturated brine. The organic phase was dried and filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated. The residue was separated by rapid silica gel column chromatography [0-50% ethyl acetate: petroleum ether] to obtain methyl 2,6-dimethylenetetrahydro-1H-pyrrolizine-7a(5H)-carboxylate (11.3 g, yield: 93.16%).

The mixture was reacted at 0\u2103 for 2 hours. After the reaction, 25ml of water was added, stirred for 30 minutes, 75ml of 2N sodium hydroxide solution was added, stirred for 30 minutes, 25ml of water was added, stirred for 1 hour, diluted with dichloromethane, the organic phase was separated and washed once with saturated brine. The organic phase was dried and filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated to obtain (2,6-dimethy1tetrahydro-1H-pyrrolizine-7a(5H)-yl)methanol (3.1g, yield: 90.64%).
