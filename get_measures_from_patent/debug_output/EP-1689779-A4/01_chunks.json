    "wide variety of protein scaffold-based libraries are suitable for use in the methods of the present invention for identifying NIgSBR. These diverse libraries as well as methods for screening them to identify members that bind to the target molecule are well known in the art (see e.g., the protein scaffolds known as \"Trinectin,\" based on fibronectins, and the display technology known as \"Profusion,\" of Phylos, Inc., Lexington, MA; Affibodies based on S. aureus protein A of Affibody AB; and Anticalens based on lipocalin of Pieris Proteolab AG). Non-protein capture molecules such as DNA aptamers which bind to protein with high specificity and affinity are also used in libraries and arrays (SomaLogic). The process known in the art as \"SELEX\" is one methodology for the identification of these nucleic acid aptamers. These molecules are identified by one of ordinary skill in the art using these available techniques to isolate NIgSBR of the present invention.</p>[0061] Directed protein evolution-based libraries and screening methodologies can also be used to identify NIgSBR of the present invention. These techniques generally involve randomly inducing mutations at the genetic level, followed by selection for desired characteristics at the protein level. Directed protein evolution-based libraries and methods for making and screening them are well known in the art.</p>[0062] Protein arrays can also be utilized to identify NIgSBR of the present invention. Protein arrays are solid phase binding assay systems using immobilized proteins on surfaces such as glass, plastic, membranes, beads or any other surface. These arrays are used to isolate individual members from display libraries that have the selected binding characteristics. Protein arrays may be used in the methods of the present invention to select for NIgSBR and anti-NIgSAb from phage display or ribosome display libraries. Protein arrays are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, as are methods for making and using them.</p>[0063] Numerous U.S. Patents and published U.S. Patent Applications disclose the variety of libraries and methods for making and screening them to find molecules that bind to a target. Examples of these libraries and methods are disclosed in the following U.S. Patents and published U.S. Patent Applications, and each is incorporated by reference \n\nherein. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 6,605,449, 6,537,776 and U.S. Application Serial Nos. 2002/0146762, and 2002/0142394 assigned to Diversa Corporation; U.S. Patent No. 5,811,238 assigned to Affymax; U.S. Patent No. 6,489,103 assigned to Medical Research Council; U.S. Application Serial No. 2003/0186223 assigned to Dyax Corporation; U.S. Patent Nos. 6,376,190, 6,331,398, 6,114,120, 6,110,900, 5,843,653, 5,707,796, 6,159,690, 5,696,249, 5,670,637, 5,475,096, 5,270,163, U.S. Application Serial Nos. 2003/0157487, 2003/0044818, and 2002/0102599 assigned to SELEX Techniques; U.S. Patent Nos. 6,613,514, 6,602,986, 6,586,182, 6,579,67",

BIOL., 127-147 (1999) and references cited therein. Antibodies have also been produced in large amounts from transgenic plant seeds including antibody fragments, such as single chain antibodies (scFv's), including tobacco seeds and potato tubers. See, e.g., Conrad et al., 38 PLANT MOL. Biol., 101-109 (1998) and reference cited therein. Thus, antibodies of the present invention can also be produced using transgenic plants, according to know methods. See also, e.g., Fischer et al., 30 BIOTECHNOL. APPL. BIOCHEM., 99-108 (Oct., 1999); Ma et al, 13 TRENDS BIOTECHNOL., 522-527 (1995); Ma et al, 109 PLANT PHYSIOL., 341-346 (1995); Whitelam et al., 22 BIOCHEM. SOC.

In a preferred embodiment, at least one anti-NIgS Ab of the present invention can optionally bind native immunoglobulin protein with at least a sufficiently high affinity for use in Western blotting.</p>[0067] The affinity or avidity of an antibody for an antigen can be determined experimentally using any suitable method. (See, for example, Berzofsky et al., \"Antibody- Antigen Interactions,\" In Fundamental h-nmunology. Fourth Edition (W.E. Paul (Ed.), Lippincott-Raven: New York, New York, 1999); Janis Kuby, Immunology. (W. H. Freeman and Company: New York, New York, 1992); and methods described herein). The measured \n\naffinity of a particular antibody-antigen interaction can vary if measured under different conditions (e.g., salt concentration, pH). Thus, measurements of affinity and other antigen- binding parameters (e.g., K<sub>D</sub>, K<sub>a</sub>, K ) are preferably made with standardized solutions of antibody and antigen, and a standardized buffer, such as the buffers described herein. Nucleic Acid Molecules [0068] Using the information provided herein, a nucleic acid molecule of the present invention encoding at least one anti-NIgS Ab can be obtained using methods described herein or as known in the art.</p>[0069] In order to obtain nucleic acid molecules encoding the anti-NIgS Ab of the present invention, the amino acid sequence of the antibody may be necessary. To accomplish this, antibody protein may be purified and partial amino acid sequence determined by au"
