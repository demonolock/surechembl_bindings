    "ell lines. The relative growth rates of five cell lines were assessed by seeding an equal number of cells and measuring cell number using Alamar Blue metabolism after 1, 2 and 3 days. BJ-TERT/LT/ST/RAS<sup>V12 </sup>cells grow faster than the other lines. BJ-TERT cells grow more slowly than the other cell lines. The rates of growth of the other three cell lines are the same. This information was used to ensure that RAS-selective lethal compounds such as erastin are not simply selective for rapidly dividing cells. Compounds with RAS selectivity should differentially affect the three cell lines that grow at the same rate but have different oncogenic RAS status.</p>FIG. 4 shows that oncogenic RAS activates numerous signaling pathways. The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway is particularly important in causing sensitivity to erastin-induced death.

BJ-TERT/LT/ST/RAS<sup>V12 </sup>tumor cells were seeded in six-well dishes, incubated overnight at 37\u00b0 C. with 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>and were treated with nothing (NT), staurosporine (ST, 1 \u03bcM) for 6 h, camptothecin (C, 1 \u03bcM) for 18 h, or erastin (20 \u03bcg/mL) for the indicated time, lysed and analyzed by western blot with an anti-PARP1 antibody. A relatively high concentration of erastin was used to ensure loss of PARP cleavage was not due to a concentration-dependent effect. PARP1 (top band) is cleaved from 110 kD to 85 kD in response to staurosporine, is degraded in response to camptothecin, and is unaffected by erastin (by 18 h, erastin-treated cells are almost all dead and little protein remains).</p>FIG. 6 shows that erastin does not induce cytochrome c release from mitochondria. BJ-TERT/LT/ST/RAS<sup>V12 </sup>cells were seeded in polystyrene 100\u00d720 mm dishes in 10 ml media. After overnight incubation at 37\u00b0 C. with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, the cells were treated with nothing (NT), staurosporine (ST, 1 \u03bcM) or erastin (20 \u03bcg/mL) for 6 h, washed with 10 mL ice-cold PBS and lysed by passage through a 25-gauge needle (five strokes). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 1850 rpm for 5 min at 4\u00b0 C. to remove the nuclear fraction. Mitochondria were removed from the soluble cytosolic fraction by pelleting at 10,000 rpm. Supernatant and mitochondrial pellets were solubilized in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and analyzed by western blot using anti-cytochrome c and pan-VDAC antibodies and IR-dye-linked secondary antibodies. VDACs are mitochondrial proteins, so their absence in the cytosolic lane indicates effective separation of cytosol (C) from mitochondria (M). Fluorescence was detected on a LI-COR Odyssey infrared scanner.</p>FIG. 7 shows that anti-oxidants suppress erastin-induced death. BJ-TERT/LT/ST/RAS<sup>V12 </sup>cells were treated as indicated for 24 hours and photographed.

    ":</p>Once a binding protein such as VDAC is identified, it can be determined whether binding of a compound to the candidate protein is the basis for the compound's phenotypic activity. There are a number of methods to validate candidate targets. Non-limiting examples of such methods are: (i) RNA-interference knockdown, (ii) cDNA-based overexpression, (iii) in vitro binding studies, (iv) photo-crosslinking and (v) creating a binding-defective mutant of the target.</p>In non-limiting examples, RNA-interference-mediated knockdown and cDNA-based overexpression are methods for decreasing and increasing, respectively, the concentration of a protein. For many small molecules, altering the level of the target protein will alter the compound potency. For example, decreasing the concentration of tubulin, the target of benomyl, causes increased sensitivity to benomyl<sup>28</sup>. In contrast, compounds that act via a gain of function have the opposite relationship with their target proteins: increasing the concentration of topoisomerase I, the target of camptothecin, which acts via a gain of function, causes increased sensitivity to camptothecin<sup>8, 29-39</sup>.</p>In a non-limiting example, in vitro binding studies can determine the binding parameters associated with a small-molecule-protein interaction. A candidate protein is overexpressed, purified and incubated with a test compound. Useful parameters extracted from such experiments are the on-rate, the off-rate, the equilibrium dissociation constant and the entropic and enthalpic contributions to binding affinity. Two methods used to measure protein-ligand interactions are surface plasmon resonance and isothermal titration calorimetry.</p>In a non-limiting example, photo-crosslinking can identify a binding site for a small molecule on a protein<sup>40-42</sup>. A photoactivatable moiety is incorporated into a compound to enable crosslinking to a target protein. Benzophenones can be photo-activated with long wavelength (&gt;300 nm) light, resulting in less destruction of compounds and proteins. Labeled protein is digested with a protease and labeled peptides are identified with mass spectrometry. In this way, a specific peptide sequence to which a compound is crosslinked is determined, suggesting binding sites.</p>In a non-limiting example, creating a mutant protein of a target that does not bind to the test compound can be a useful method of assessing the functional relevance of the target-ligand interaction. For example, mutants of the mTOR protein that don't bind its ligand rapamycin were used to show that mTOR is the cellular target of rapamycin<sup>43, 44</sup>.</p>Creation of a Genome-Scale Lentiviral shRNA Collection:</p>A powerful method of illuminating the mechanism of action of novel RAS-selective lethal compounds is to perform a large-scale suppressor screen with RNA interference reagents that reduce expression of specific mRNAs. Such suppressors might reveal direct targets of compounds, o",
    "</sup>. VDAC1's role in the plasma membrane is enigmatic; it has been proposed to function as an NADH:ferricyanide-reductase. VDACs interact with hexokinase<sup>82</sup>, the permeability transition pore<sup>83</sup>, inter-mitochondrial membrane contact sites<sup>84</sup>, the mitochondrial protein import complex<sup>85 </sup>and microtubule associated protein-2 (MAP-2)<sup>86</sup>. VDACs have been reported to interact with BCL proteins and to participate in the formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore that facilitates release of cytochrome c from mitochondria<sup>87-89</sup>. VDACs may regulate access of metabolites to the mitochondrial inter-membrane space. In yeast, NADH is transported into mitochondria through yeast VDAC<sup>90</sup>. Finally, VDAC permeability has been linked to cell survival<sup>91</sup>, demonstrating that regulated opening of VDACs occurs in a physiological context.</p>Cell Death Pathways:There are at least three types of mammalian cell death: (i) apoptotic death, (ii) autophagic death and (iii) necrotic death<sup>92, 93</sup>. Apoptosis is an intrinsic death program<sup>94 </sup>involving activation of cysteine proteases (caspases)<sup>93, 94</sup>. Autophagic death involves self-digestion of cellular material through formation of lysosome-like autophagosomes<sup>95</sup>. Necrosis is a passive death process that involves loss of cellular homeostasis<sup>96</sup>. Markers of apoptosis (Table 1) include cleavage of PARP1 from 113 kD to 85 kD<sup>97</sup>, staining of by Annexin V98, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria<sup>99</sup>, cleavage of chromosomal DNA<sup>100</sup>, TUNEL staining<sup>100</sup>, margination of chromatin<sup>101</sup>, activation of caspases<sup>102 </sup>and decreased cell size<sup>99 </sup>(Table 1, column 2). Markers of necrotic cell death include increased PARP activity<sup>97</sup>, clumping of chromatin<sup>92, 93, 96, 103</sup>, decreased intracellular [ATP]<sup>92, 93, 96, 103</sup>, increased cell size and formation of reactive oxygen species<sup>96 </sup>(Table 1, column 3). Markers of autophagic death include autophagosomes<sup>95, 104, 105</sup>, sensitivity to 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and increased lysosomal activity (Table 1, column 4)<sup>95, 104, 105</sup>. Overlapping phenotypes exist: it is possible to activate apoptotic-like mechanisms without caspases, or mixed apo-necrototic death<sup>103</sup>. Other possible death programs include paraptosis and mitotic catastrophe<sup>106-113</sup>.</p>TABLE 1Markers of different cell death phenotype, including markersfor the oxidative cell death provided by the inventionAPOPTOTICNECROTICAUTOPHAGICOXIDATIVEMARKERDEATHDEATHDEATHCELL DEATHPoly(ADP)ribosecleavage toIncreasedunknownno cleavagepolymerase85 kDa formactivityno activationAnnexin Vincreasedno changeNo changenostainingDNA ladderingyesnoNonoTUNEL stainingyessometimesNoNoNuclearmargination/clumping,partialno changesmorphologyfragmentationkaryolysiscondensationATPnoLargeN",
    "into the yeast VDAC locus, can be immobilized on a sensor chip using an Abcam pan-anti-VDAC antibody. Proteins such as GST, avidin and bovine serum albumin can serve as negative protein controls. Erastin B1 and camptothecin, or any other unrelated compound can be used as negative small molecule controls. To use SPR, VDAC proteins can be solubilized in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris (pH 7.0), 0.1 M (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 10% glycerol, protease inhibitor tablet and 1% lipid/detergent mixture drawn from various combinations of lipids, such as DOPE (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine), DOPS (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine) and DOPC (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine). The solubilized protein can be captured on an anti-his antibody immobilized on a CM4 Biacore sensor chip, or an anti-VDAC antibody immobilized on a sensor chip. A Biacore 3000 optical sensor can be used to perform these measurements<sup>154, 155</sup>. Erastin A3 can be immobilized on a Biacore chip and the binding of solubilized VDAC protein to the chip can be measured. This would provide a larger signal because of the greater molecular weight of VDAC relative to erastin. SPR can be preferable for initial studies because it uses less protein than calorimetry, SPR can use protein in the range of 100 \u03bcg versus mg quantities for calorimetry.</p>In another embodiment, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) can be used to measure the molar enthalpy (\u0394H) and equilibrium binding constant (K<sub>B</sub>) for the interaction between an agent which induces oxidative cell death, such as for example erastin, and any of the isoforms of the VDAC proteins. Calorimetry is the gold-standard method for measuring binding because it does not suffer from artifacts of surface chemistry that can complicate SPR binding data. From the calorimetry data, the Gibbs free energy of binding (\u0394G=\u2212RT In K<sub>B</sub>) and the entropy of binding (\u0394S=(\u0394H\u2212\u0394G)/T) can be calculated, where R is the ideal gas constant and T is the temperature in the experiment<sup>156, 157</sup>. By performing this experiment at multiple temperatures, the change in heat capacity upon binding (at constant pressure), \u0394Cp, can be calculated. Thus, these experiments allow characterization of the thermodynamic parameters associated with binding of erastin to each VDAC isoform. As controls, the binding of an agent which induces oxidative cell death, such as for example erastin, to several other proteins can be tested, including glutathione-S-transferase (GST), avidin and bovine serum albumin.</p>In other embodiments, mutations in VDACs that are predicted to disrupt binding, based on a homology model and docking experiments can be designed. VDAC mutant proteins of any one of the isoforms can be expressed, purified, and tested for their binding to an agent which induces oxidative cell death, such as for example erastin. It is recommended that the concentration of protein in an ITC ligand-binding experiment be at least 10 times the K<sub>B </sub>estimate<sup>156</sup>. Given that erastin has a potency of 1 to 5 \u03bcM in several tumor cell lines, this is an upper limit on K<sub>B</sub>. It is desirable to have 20 \u03bcM VDAC protein in solution when erastin is added in the ITC experiment to ensure all added erastin is bound to target protein. Given that the sample cell requires 1.4 mL, 28 nmol of each VDAC, or \u02dc1 mg of each VDAC protein are needed for each calorimetry experiment. Thus, about 5 to 10 mg of each VDAC isoform is necessary for this set of experiments. This is achievable given published VDAC expression protocols<sup>152</sup>. For these experiments, erastin can be used as the experimental compound and erastin B1 as a negative control that is not expected to bind to VDAC proteins with high affinity, given its lack of lethality. Microcal Omega Isothermal Titration Calorimeter, which consists of an Omega reaction cell (T115), control module (T106) and nanovoltmeter (059), can be used for these experiments.</p>In another embodiment, there is provided a method for determining whether there is a change in the fluorescence of any of the VDAC proteins upon incubation with an agent, such as for example erastin. If erastin binds near a hydrophobic residue (Trp, Tyr or Phe), it is possible that the binding would cause a change in the fluorescence of VDAC that would allow us to determine the binding constant for this interaction. This would readily be detected using a fluorescence spectrometer. In another embodiment, a <sup>3</sup>H-labeled erastin analog can be created and used in a radioligand binding assay. The <sup>3</sup>H-labeled erastin analog can be created by acetylating erastin A3 with [H<sup>3</sup>]-CH<sub>2</sub>COCl. Erastin A3 is the affinity analog used to purify VDAC, and <sup>3</sup>H-labeled erastin analog can be used in a charcoal precipitation or filter-binding assay.</p>Measurement of Effect of Erastin on VDAC-Mediated Transport In Vitro:In certain embodiments, the effect of agent, such as for example erastin, on VDAC-mediated transport in reconstituted liposomes and lipid bilayers can be determined. The flow of ATP through each VDAC isoform determined in the presence of erastin or erastin B1, can be used as a negative control. A method for measuring the flux of ATP through VDAC channels reconstituted into planar phospholipids membranes has been reported<sup>158</sup>. In a certain embodiment of this method, VDAC channels are open at low voltage (&lt;10 mV) and closed at higher voltages. The method involves forming lipid bilayer membranes with a 1% solution of diphytanoylphosphatidyl choline and cholesterol in hexane using a modified Montal-Mueller technique<sup>59</sup>. VDAC proteins in 1% Triton X-100 are added to one side of the planar lipid bilayer; subsequently, a concentrated ATP solution is added to the same (cis) side. Aliquots are removed from the trans side and mixed with a D-luciferin/luciferase solution; light output is determined using a luminometer; the [ATP] on the trans side can be calculated as a function of time using a calibration curve. In certain embodiments, this method can be used to determine whether an agent, such as for example erastin, accelerates or impedes the rate of ATP flux through each VDAC isoform. In certain embodiments, the experiments can be performed as a function of membrane voltage t"
