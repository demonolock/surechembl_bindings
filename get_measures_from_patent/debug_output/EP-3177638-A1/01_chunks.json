    "ted to the N terminal of the peptide to form fluorescent ZD2 probe (ZD2- Cy5). Cyclization of the peptide was carried out by exposing the peptide to air in 10% DMSO/PBS. Purification of the cyclic peptide was done using RP-HPLC followed by lyophilization. The peptide and peptide ZD-2 conjugate were characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. \n\n Peptide ELISA </p> [00110] A linear version of ZD2 (CTVRTSADA) was synthesized so that sulfhydryl group on cysteine could be used for conjugation with maleimide-activated peroxide (Sigma- Aldrich). Conjugation was carried out as instructed in the manual. The product of conjugation, ZD2-HRP, was used for peptide ELISA assay after coating a 96-well plate with purified EDB. 0.5% BSA in PBS was used to block non-specific binding for later steps. 0.39\u03bc\u039c to 50\u03bc\u039c of ZD2-HRP was incubated with coated EDB for an hour followed by extensive washing with TBST (0.1%). ABTS substrate was added subsequently and allowed to react for 30min before the absorbance of solution in each well were measured at 415nm. Non-coated wells added with ABTS were used as blank. </p> In vitro cellular binding </p> [00111] PC3 cell line was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA), and maintained in RPMI/10% FBS medium. The cells were transfected with lentivirus to express green fluorescent protein (GFP) at least 48 h prior to harvesting. To induce EMT, PC3 cells were cultured in the presence of TGF i (5 ng/ml) for 5 days. For in vitro binding assay, nuclei of cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 (Life Technologies, Brooklyn, NY, USA) 24 h prior to adding 500 nM ZD2-Cy5. Cells were maintained in medium containing ZD2-Cy5 for 24 h and monitored with confocal microscopy. Intense shaking was avoided for live-cell binding study to retain secreted EDB- FN on the glass. </p> In vivo binding in a mouse tumor model </p> [00112] NIH athymic male nude mice, age 4-5 weeks, were maintained at the Athymic Animal Core Facility at Case Western Reserve University according to the animal protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). For whole-body fluorescent imaging study, a flank tumor model was constructed. Each mouse was subcutaneously implanted in both flanks with 2xl0<sup>6</sup> PC3-GFP cells mixed with an equal volume of in a mixture of PBS (50 \\L culture medium and 50 \\L PBS). Two to three weeks after inoculation, tumors reached an average size of 0.5 cm in diameter. The mice were used for imaging with Maestro FLEX In vivo Imaging System (Cambridge Research &amp; </p>Instrumentation, Inc. Woburn, MA, USA) to monitor the targeting effect of ZD2 from 0 to 24 \n\n hours. Mice were intravenously injected with ZD2-Cy5 or CERAK-Cy5 (0.3 \u03bc\u03b7\u03b9\u03bf\u0390/kg body weight). After 5 h, the mice were sacrificed and the tumor and various organs were imaged with the Maestro FLEX In vivo Imaging System. </p> Histological staining of human prostate sections </p> [00113] Human prostate sections were acquired fr",
    " sequence of 91 amino acids encoded by a single exon, which are identical in vertebrates. The EDB fragment was expressed in E. coli by cloning codon optimized DNA sequence of EDB into an expression plasmid, pQE-T7- 1 , under the regulation of T7 promoter, as shown in Fig.1 A. The ligation of EDB DNA in the plasmid was verified by DNA sequencing. Expression and purification of EDB fragment were confirmed by SDS-PAGE as shown in Fig. IB. A Ml 3 phage library displaying cyclic \n\n nonapeptide flanked by two cysteine residues on its pill protein was used for screening EDB binding peptides. Four rounds of panning yielded an enriched phage library containing phages with high EDB binding ability, which was determined by phage ELISA assay. Out of 29 identified phage clones, the peptide sequence of CTVRTSADC (SEQ ID NO: 10) appeared 5 times and was named ZD2. </p> [00118] Cyclic ZD2 peptide (CTVRTSADC) (SEQ ID NO: 10) was synthesized using standard solid phase peptide chemistry and was characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig. lC). The peptide was then labeled with a fluorescence chromophore cyanine 5 (Cy5) through a short PEG linker (NHz- CHzCHzO^-CHzCHzCOOH) to give a peptide fluorescence probe ZD2-Cy5. The peptide was also conjugated to peroxidase (ZD2- HRP) and the binding affinity of the peptide to EDB fragment was determined using peptide ELISA assay. Fig. ID shows the concentration-dependent binding curve of ZD2-HRP to the EDB fragment, which gave the binding affinity (KD, the equilibrium dissociation constant) of 4.52 + 2.68 \u03bc\u039c between ZD2-HRP and EDB. </p> In vitro peptide binding to EDB-FN excreted by TGF i -induced PC3 cancer cells </p> [00119] Elevated expression of onfFN is a marker of EMT of prostate cancer cells. The treatment of PC3 human prostate cancer cells with TGF i resulted in an elongated mesenchymal phenotype as compared with cells without induction, as shown in Fig.2A. Up-regulation of EDB-FN expression was companied with E-Cad down-regulation and N-Cad up-regulation as determined by quantitative PCR (Fig. 2B). As a result, ZD2-Cy5 showed substantially more binding to the periphery of the PC3 cells treated with TGF i than the untreated cells because of the production and secretion of EDB-FN by the </p>TGF i -induced cells as shown in Fig. 2C. </p> In vivo binding of ZD2-Cy5 in a mouse PC 3 prostate tumor model </p> [00120] Whole-body fluorescence imaging of mice bearing PC3-GFP flank tumor xenografts showed significantly high accumulation of ZD2-Cy5 in tumor (Fig. 3A). Tumor of mice injected with ZD2-Cy5 was clearly highlighted in the Cy5 fluorescence image at 1.5 h after intravenous injection. Relativel high tumor to normal (T/N) ratio of Cy5 signal could be maintained for up to 24 hours for mice injected with ZD2-Cy5, compared with mice injected with a non-specific control CERAK-Cy5 (Fig. 3B). Tumor and major organs were \n\n collected to image the Cy5 signal 5 hours after injection. The result verified the specific accumulation of Cy5 labele"
