In this example, there were 2E6 Ramos cells/well in serum free media; the cells were pretreated with compound for 1.5 hr. The B cell receptor was stimulated with anti-IgM for 3 min; the 10\u00d7 lysis buffer containing DNAse was added directly to cells. The sample buffer was added and loaded directly on gel. The samples were analyzed with western blot\u2014phosphorylated Btk and PLC\u03b31 and total Btk and PLC-\u03b31. The blot was imaged with ChemiDoc CCD and quantitated with ImageQuant. The phosphorylated band was normalized to total band and the IC50 was calculated.</p>FIG. 3 presents illustrative cell data showing that compound 4 and compound 15 inhibit growth of DHL-6 cells. In this example, there were 3E4 DHL-6 cells/well in complete media. The cells were treated for the indicated time with compound @ 0.1% DMSO final concentration. The cell number was measured using Alamar Blue assay according to standard protocol.</p>FIG. 4 presents illustrative mass spectra showing that compound 4 covalently modifies Btk. In this example, Incubate 30 uM compound 4 with 6-7 uM recombinant BTK (Y\u2192D mutant, kinase domain only) overnight at RT. Desalt protein-inhibitor complex by reversed-phase HPLC and analyze directly in mass spec to determine molecular weight. &gt;99% of recombinant Btk protein is covalently modified by compound 4.</p>FIG. 5 presents illustrative inhibition of arthritis development in a mouse model by compound 4.</p>FIG. 6 presents illustrative data demonstrating that the efficacy of compound 4 is associated with reduction of Rheumatoid Factor and Anti-citrullinated cyclic peptide antibodies in the CAIA model.

    " ATP (at the K<sub>m </sub>for the kinase), and 1 \u03bcM peptide substrate (Biotin-AVLESEEELYSSARQ-NH<sub>2</sub>) were incubated in a reaction buffer composed of 20 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, MgCl<sub>2 </sub>(5-25 mM depending on the kinase), MnCl<sub>2 </sub>(0-10 mM), 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.01% bovine serum albumin, 0.005% Tween-20, and 10% DMSO at pH 7.4 for one hour. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 1.2 equivalents of EDTA (relative to divalent cation) in 25 \u03bcL of 1\u00d7 Lance buffer (Perkin-Elmer). Streptavidin-APC (Perkin-Elmer) and Eu-labeled p-Tyr100 antibody (Perkin-Elmer) in 1\u00d7 Lance buffer were added in a 25 \u03bcL volume to give final concentrations of 100 nM and 2.5 nM, respectively, and the mixture was allowed to incubate for one hour. The TR-FRET signal was measured on a multimode plate reader with an excitation wavelength (\u03bb<sub>Ex</sub>) of 330 nm and detection wavelengths (\u03bb<sub>Em</sub>) of 615 and 665 nm. Activity was determined by the ratio of the fluorescence at 665 nm to that at 615 nm. For each compound, enzyme activity was measured at various concentrations of compound. Negative control reactions were performed in the absence of inhibitor in replicates of six, and two no-enzyme controls were used to determine baseline fluorescence levels. Inhibition constants, K<sub>i</sub>(app), were obtained using the program BatchK<sub>i </sub>(Kuzmic et al. (2000), Anal. Biochem. 286:45-50). IC<sub>50</sub>s were obtained according to the equation:\n\nIC<sub>50</sub>{Ki(app)/(1+[ATP]/K<sub>m</sub><sup>ATP</sup>)}+[E]<sub>total</sub>/2;\n</p>For all kinases, [ATP]=K<sub>m</sub><sup>ATP</sup>, [Btk]<sub>total</sub>=0.5 nM and [Lck]<sub>total</sub>=6 nM.</p>Calcium flux fluorescence-based assays were performed in a FlexStation II384 fluorometric imaging plate reader (Molecular Devices) according to manufacturer instructions. In brief, actively growing Ramos cells (ATCC) in RPM1 medium supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) were washed and re-plated in low serum medium at approximately 5\u00d710<sup>5 </sup>cells per 100 \u03bcl per well in a 96-well plate. Compounds to be assayed were dissolved in DMSO and then diluted in low serum medium to final concentrations ranging from 0 to 10 \u03bcM (at a dilution factor of 0.3). The diluted compounds were then added to each well (final DMSO concentration was 0.01%) and incubated at 37 degree in 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator for one hour. Afterwards, 100 \u03bcl of a calcium-sensitive dye (from the Calcium 3 assay kit, Molecular Devices) was added to each well and incubated for an additional hour. The compound-treated cells were stimulated with a goat anti-human IgM antibody (80 ug/ml; Jackson ImmunoResearch) and read in the FlexStation II384 using a \u03bb<sub>Ex</sub>=485 nm and \u03bb<sub>Em</sub>=538 nm for 200 seconds. The relative fluorescence unit (RFU) and the IC<sub>50 </sub>were recorded and analyzed using a built-in SoftMax program (Molecular devices).</p>TABLE 2Assay data for representative compounds<img id=\"EMI-C00063\" "
