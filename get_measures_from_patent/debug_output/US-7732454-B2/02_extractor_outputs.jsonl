In this example, Incubate 30 uM compound 4 with 6-7 uM recombinant BTK (Y\u2192D mutant, kinase domain only) overnight at RT is the only sentence that contains a molecule name, a numeric value, and a unit, but it does not contain a bioactivity metric.\n\n\nHowever, another sentence was found:\nThe sentence \"The IC50 was calculated\" does not contain a molecule name or a numeric value with a unit, so it does not meet the criteria.\n\n\nAnother sentence was found:\nNo sentence was found that meets the criteria, but the following sentence contains some relevant information: \nIn this example, there were 2E6 Ramos cells/well in serum free media; the cells were pretreated with compound for 1.5 hr.

The samples were analyzed with western blot\u2014phosphorylated Btk and PLC\u03b31 and total Btk and PLC-\u03b31. The blot was imaged with ChemiDoc CCD and quantitated with ImageQuant.
