    "f AML patients, detailed information shown in table 2) were obtained from the department of hematology, the first hospital affiliated at xiamen university.</p>AML cell lines (including KG1 alpha, kasumi) were sourced from professor Liu Pengtao, university of Cambridge, UK, sanger institute.</p>Example 1</p>Inhibition of AML cell line proliferation by combination of pharmaceutical compositions</p>The operation method comprises the following steps: taking the number of 2 multiplied by 10 <sup>4</sup> AML cell strains (including KG1 alpha and Kasumi cell strains) in a logarithmic growth phase are inoculated in a 96-well plate, an Apatinib group, a Chidamide group and a mixed group of Apatinib with different concentrations and Chidamide with different concentrations are respectively arranged, after each group acts for 48 hours, the proliferation condition of AML cells in different groups is detected by using a CCK8 kit.</p>As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the KG 1. Alpha. Cell line acted for 48h in FIG. 1, and the Kasumi cell line acted for 72h in FIG. 2. As can be seen from fig. 1: the combination of Apatinib and Chidamide has the effect of obviously inhibiting the proliferation of various AML cell strains, and has more obvious inhibition effect on proliferation than that of single Apatinib or Chidamide; moreover, the combined pharmaceutical composition of Apatinib and Chidamide has significant concentration dependence on the proliferation inhibition of various AML cell lines.</p>The IC50 values of the KG 1. Alpha. And Kasumi cell line proliferation inhibition of each group are shown in Table 1 (data are shown as Mean. + -. SD), and the data results in Table 1 correspond to those in FIG. 1.</p>TABLE 1</p></p>Example 2</p>Evaluation of apoptosis-inducing Effect of combination drug composition on AML cell line</p>The operation method comprises the following steps: taking the quantity of 2 multiplied by 10 <sup>5</sup> AML cell strains (KG 1 alpha cell strains) in logarithmic growth phase are inoculated in a 24-well plate, apatinib groups, chidamide groups and mixed groups of Apatinib with different concentrations and Chidamide with different concentrations are respectively arranged, after each group acts for 48 hours, the Annexin V/PI kit is used for detecting the apoptosis condition of AML cells in different groups (the specific operation steps are carried out according to the kit instructions).</p>The results are shown in FIG. 3, and it can be seen from FIG. 3 that: the combination of Apatinib and Chidamide has the effect of remarkably inducing the apoptosis of AML cell strains, and has more remarkable apoptosis induction effect than that of single Apatinib or Chidamide; moreover, the combined pharmaceutical composition of Apatinib and Chidamide has significant concentration dependence on the apoptosis-inducing effect of various AML cell lines.</p>Example 3</p>Evaluation of the Effect of combination pharmaceutical compositions on AML cells from Primary ce"
