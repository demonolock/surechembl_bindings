    "duct Inhibition data were calculated by comparison to no enzyme control reactions for 100% inhibition and vehicle-only reactions for 0% inhibition. The final concentration of reagents in the assays is ATP, 8 \u03bcM; JAK3 fluorescent peptide, 1.5 \u03bcM; JAK3, 2.5 nM; and DMSO, 1.6%. Dose response curves were generated to determine the concentration required inhibiting 50% of kinase activity (IC<sub>50</sub>). Compounds were dissolved at 10 mM in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and evaluated at eleven concentrations, each in duplicate. IC<sub>50 </sub>values were derived by non-linear regression analysis.</p>Cell Proliferation Inhibition AssayCompounds were evaluated for their ability to inhibit cell proliferation, using an assay that measures thymidine incorporation in the DNA of the dividing cell, which is directly correlated with cell numbers. SET-2 cells were plated at 10000 cells/well in 96-well plates and were cultured for 24 h in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, before test compounds were added. Compounds were diluted in culture medium such that the final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide never exceeded 0.1%. Following the addition of compounds, the cells were cultured for an additional 72 h before cell proliferation was determined by measuring DNA synthesis with 3H-thymidine incorporation.</p>Compounds described herein were tested in the JAK2 and Cell Proliferation Inhibition assay described above. The following results were obtained.</p>TABLE 1JAK2SET-2Example#(IC50, uM)(IC50, uM)31.50E\u2212030.0140.032.53151.52E\u2212030.49290.0110.00336.37E\u2212040.01341.50E\u2212030.24355.36E\u2212042.85380.040.06490.053.93531.47E\u2212030.10557.48E\u2212044.30E\u221203617.51E\u221204707.33E\u2212040.33731.00E\u2212030.06810.015230.339980.0006950.0073651017.43E\u22120410.001091.52E\u2212034.151161.49E\u2212030.171250.051.27</p>Compounds described herein have been tested in one or more of the above identified assays and have been found to be active.</p>C. In Vivo AssayCompound formulated in appropriate vehicle was administered to mice either as an oral bolus or injected intraperitoneally or subcutaneously to Balb/C mice. Blood samples were collected through orbital bleeding or cardiac puncture at various time points post compound administration. Aliquots (90 \u03bcL) of the blood were placed in a 96 well plate. Diluted solution (5 ul) of murine thrombopoietin (mTPO; Peprotech) (diluted 1:1000 in dPBS/BSA, 2 \u03bcL in 2 ml dPBS/BSA was delivered to each well for pathway stimulation. The plates were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. in a water bath for 10 minutes. 1.5 ml of fix/lyse solution (from BD Biosciences) was added to each well. The samples were then incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 15 minutes to ensure lysis of red blood cells (RBCs). The plates were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 minutes and aspirated using the V&amp;P 96 well aspirator. The cells were washed with dPBS, re-centrifuged, re-suspended and transferred to a regular 96 well plate. The cells were washed twice with dPBS followed by addition of CD61 FITC (from eBiosciences) for surface rece"
