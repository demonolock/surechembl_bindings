{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences:\n\nFull-length recombinant collagen IX has an apparent Kd of 3.6 nM for the heparin binding and electron microscopy suggests the presence of four heparin-binding sites located within or near all four NC domains.\nThe heparin-binding ability of the NC4 domain was found to be rather moderate with a Kd of 0.6 \u03bcM.\nThe binding affinity of the matrilin-3 A-domain for type IX collagen was shown to be a few nM and the binding site was mapped to the amino-terminal part of COL3."}
