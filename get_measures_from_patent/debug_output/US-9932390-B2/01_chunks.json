    "llular matrix of cartilage (30), tendon (31) and ligament, where it is thought to play an important role in tissue development and homeostasis through interactions with cells (32) and collagens I and II (33). Mutations in COMP or collagen IX are known to result in phenotypes within the multiple epiphyseal dysplasia disease spectrum and suggested their interaction. Indeed, COMP was shown to interact with collagen IX and the binding sites were mapped to regions within or close to all four NC domains of collagen IX (34,35). Statistical analysis of COMP binding sites along collagen IX molecules using electron microscopy showed the highest frequency of occupation of the NC2 domain in the long isoform of collagen IX from cartilage and an even higher frequency for the short isoform (lacking the NC4 domain) from vitreous (34). Accordingly, the chain selection and heterotrimerization properties of the NC2 domain compositions of the instant invention can be used as a tool for a recombinant production of the correctly folded NC3 and NC1 domains, the other binding candidates for COMP.</p>In an alternative example, the collagen IX NC2 domain compositions of the instant invention can be employed to modulate collagen's interaction with glycosaminoglycans. Glycosaminoglycans play important roles in cell adhesion and extracellular matrix assembly. A remarkable binding of heparin to collagen IX was reported (36) and further analyzed (37,38). Full-length recombinant collagen IX has an apparent Kd of 3.6 nM for the heparin binding and electron microscopy suggests the presence of four heparin-binding sites located within or near all four NC domains (37). The heparin-binding ability of the NC4 domain was found to be rather moderate with a Kd of 0.6 \u03bcM (37) which emphasized the importance of other heparin-binding sites along the molecule. Whereas the NC4 domain is a product of the single \u03b11 chain, all other domains are heterotrimeric and their production will again require the usage of the NC2 domain.</p>Similarly, the binding affinity of the matrilin-3 A-domain for type IX collagen was shown to be a few nM and the binding site was mapped to the amino-terminal part of COL3 (39). Detailed structural insight into this interaction can now be gained by an adequate design of heterotrimeric collagenous peptides spanning COL3 using the NC2 domain compositions of the instant invention.</p>2.2. Methods of Detection and/or Treatment Using Collagen IX NC2 Domain Compositions</p>In certain embodiments the compositions of the present invention can find use in the detection, diagnosis and/or treatment of a disease or other medical condition. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to: infectious diseases, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and other genetic diseases. In certain embodiments detection, diagnosis, and/or treatment is mediated via the presence of one or more heterologous moieties capable of binding to a marker of such disease or medical condition, such as, but not limited to, a polypeptide, a nucleic acid, or a polysaccharide indicative of such disease or medical condition. In certain embodiments detection, diagnosis, and/or treatment is aided by the presence of one or more heterologous moieties capable of em"
