    "ded protein response that binds to the endoplasmic reticulum molecules of PERK, IRE1 alpha, ATF6, maintaining the three signaling pathways Perk-eIF2 alpha-ATF 4, IRE1 alpha-XBP 1s, and ATF6 in an inactive state. Considering the interaction of C8orf84 with HSPA5, we verified the unfolded protein response and its associated changes in the signaling pathway after overexpression of the C8orf84 gene using western blot analysis. As a result, it was found that the levels of PERK, IRE1 \u03b1, ATF6 and CHOP protein expression were increased in bladder cancer cells overexpressing C8orf84 gene compared to the blank vector control group (FIG. 6). This suggests that the overexpressed C8orf84 protein may lead to activation of the unfolded protein response by interacting with HSPA 5.</p>as can be seen from the above results, the expression of C8orf84 gene was down-regulated in bladder cancer tissues and cells, and the low expression of C8orf84 gene was an independent risk factor for poor bladder cancer patient prognosis. The C8orf84 gene is a therapeutic target of bladder cancer, and the C8orf84 gene can be introduced into a bladder cancer patient through gene therapy or the C8orf84 protein is administered into the bladder cancer patient, so that the bladder cancer is expected to be treated.</p>Reference documents:</p>[1]Chen W,Zheng R,Baade PD,Zhang S,Zeng H,Bray F,Jemal A,Yu XQ,He J:Cancer statistics in China, 2015.CA:a cancer journal for clinicians 2016,66(2):115-132.</p>[2]Siegel RL,Miller KD,Jemal A:Cancer statistics,2016.CA:A Cancer Journal for Clinicians 2016, 66(1):7-30.</p>[3]Thoma C:Bladder cancer:Noninvasive diagnosis and detection of recurrence.Nature reviews Urology 2016,13(5):240-241.</p>[4]Jacobs BL,Lee CT,Montie JE:Bladder cancer in 2010:how far have we come\uff1fCA:a cancer journal for clinicians 2010,60(4):244-272.</p>[5]Ploeg M,Aben KK,Kiemeney LA:The present and future burden of urinary bladder cancer in the world.
