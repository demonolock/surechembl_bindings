    "e determined by surface plasmon resonance (Biacore3000\u2122 surface plasmon resonance (SPR) system, Biacore, INC, Piscataway N.J.) equipped with pre-immobilized streptavidin sensor chips (SA) using HBS-EP running buffer (0.01M HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% v/v Surfactant P20). Biotinylated human CGRP (or any other CGRP) can be diluted into HBS-EP buffer to a concentration of less than 0.5 ug/mL and injected across the individual chip channels using variable contact times, to achieve two ranges of antigen density, either 50-200 response units (RU) for detailed kinetic studies or 800-1,000 RU for screening assays. Regeneration studies have shown that 25 mM NaOH in 25% v/v ethanol effectively removes the bound Fab while keeping the activity of CGRP on the chip for over 200 injections. Typically, serial dilutions (spanning concentrations of 0.1-10\u00d7 estimated K<sub>D</sub>) of purified Fab samples are injected for 1 min at 100 \u03bcL/minute and dissociation times of up to 2 hours are allowed. The concentrations of the Fab proteins are determined by ELISA and/or SDS-PAGE electrophoresis using a Fab of known concentration (as determined by amino acid analysis) as a standard. Kinetic association rates (k<sub>on</sub>) and dissociation rates (k<sub>off</sub>) are obtained simultaneously by fitting the data globally to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model (Karlsson, R. Roos, H. Fagerstam, L. Petersson, B. (1994). Methods Enzymology 6. 99-110) using the BIAevaluation program. Equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) values are calculated as k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>. This protocol is suitable for use in determining binding affinity of an antibody to any CGRP, including human CGRP, CGRP of another mammalian (such as mouse CGRP, rat CGRP, primate CGRP), as well as different forms of CGRP (such as \u03b1 and \u03b2 form). Binding affinity of an antibody is generally measured at 25\u00b0 C., but can also be measured at 37\u00b0 C.</p>The anti-CGRP antagonist antibodies may be made by any method known in the art.

In that manner, \u201cchimeric\u201d or \u201chybrid\u201d antibodies are prepared that have the binding specificity of an anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody herein.</p>Anti-CGRP antagonist antibodies and polypeptides derived from antibodies can be identified or characterized using methods known in the art, whereby reduction, amelioration, or neutralization of an CGRP biological activity is detected and/or measured. For example, anti-CGRP antagonist antibody can also be identified by incubating a candidate agent with CGRP and monitoring any one or more of the following characteristics: (a) bind to CGRP; (b) block CGRP from binding to its receptor(s); (c) block or decrease CGRP receptor activation (including cAMP activation); (d) inhibit CGRP biological activity or downstream pathways mediated by CGRP signaling function; (e) prevent, ameliorate, or treat any aspect of headache (e.g., migraine); (f) increase clearance of CGRP; and (g) inhibit (reduce) CGRP synthesis, production or release. In some embodiments, an anti-CGRP antagonist antibody or polypeptide is identified by incubating a candidate agent with CGRP and monitoring binding and/or attendant reduction or neutralization of a biological activity of CGRP. The binding assay may be performed with purified CGRP polypeptide(s), or with cells naturally expressing, or transfected to express, CGRP polypeptide(s). In one embodiment, the binding assay is a competitive binding assay, where the ability of a candidate antibody to compete with a known anti-CGRP antagonist for CGRP binding is evaluated. The assay may be performed in various formats, including the ELISA format. In other embodiments, an anti-CGRP antagonist antibody is identified by incubating a candidate agent with CGRP and monitoring binding and attendant inhibition of CGRP receptor activation expressed on the surface of a cell.</p>Following initial identification, the activity of a candidate anti-CGRP antagonist antibody can be further confirmed and refined by bioassays, known to test the targeted biological activities. Alternatively, bioassays can be used to screen candidates directly. For example, CGRP promotes a number of measurable changes in responsive cells. These include, but are not limited to, stimulation of cAMP in the cell (e.g., SK-N-MC cells). Antagonist activity may also be measured using animal models, such as measuring skin vasodilatation induced by stimulation of the rat saphenous nerve. Escott et al., Br. J. Pharmacol. 110: 772-776, 1993. Animal models of headaches (such as, migraine) may further be used for testing efficacy of antagonist antibodies or polypeptides. Reuter, et al., Functional Neurology (15) Suppl. 3, 2000.

Different variants of human \u03b1-CGRP with single alanine substitutions were generated by peptide synthesis. Their amino acid sequences are shown in Table 4 along with all the other peptides used in the Biacore analysis. Affinities of Fab fragments of the anti-CGRP antibodies to these variants were determined using Biacore as described above. As shown in FIG. 1, all 12 antibodies target a C-terminal epitope, with amino acid F37 being the most crucial residue. Mutation of F37 to alanine significantly lowered the affinity or even completely knocked out binding of the anti-CGRP antibodies to the peptide. The next most important amino acid residue is G33, however, only the high affinity antibodies (7E9, 8B6, 10A8, and 7D11) were affected by alanine replacement at this position. Amino acid residue S34 also plays a significant, but lesser, role in the binding of these four high affinity antibodies.</p>TABLE 2Characteristics of the anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies'binding to human \u03b1-CGRP and their antagonist activityCell-based blockingIC<sub>50 </sub>(nM bindingK<sub>D </sub>toK<sub>D </sub>tohuman \u03b1-CGRPsites) at 25\u00b0 C.humanhumanbinding to its(room temp.)\u03b1-CGRP\u03b1-CGRPreceptor at 25\u00b0 C.measured inAnti-at 25\u00b0 C.at 37\u00b0 C.(measured by cAMPradioligandbodies(nM)(nM)activation)binding assay.7E91.00.9Yes2.58B61.11.2Yes4.010A82.13.0Yesn.d.7D114.45.4Yesn.d.6H29.342Yes12.9490161139Yes5814E1080179Yesn.d.9B885183Non.d.13C294379Non.d.14A9148581Non.d.6D5210647Non.d.1C5296652Non.d.Note:Antibody 4901 is commercially available (Sigma, Product No. C7113).n.d. = not determined</p>TABLE 3Characteristics of the anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies'binding to rat \u03b1-CGRP and antagonist activityK<sub>D </sub>toCell-based blocking ofratbinding of rat \u03b1-CGRP toIn vivo\u03b1-CGRPits receptor at 25\u00b0 C.blocking inAnti-at 37\u00b0 C.(measured by cAMPsaphenousbodies(nM)activation)nerve assay49013.4YesYes7E947YesYes6H254NoNo8B675YesYes7D11218YesYes10A8451Non.d.9B8876Non.d.14E10922Non.d.13C2&gt;1000Non.d.14A9&gt;1000Non.d.6D5&gt;1000Non.d.1C5&gt;1000Non.d.\u201cn.d.\u201d indicates no test was performed for the antibody.</p>TABLE\u20034Amino\u2003acid\u2003sequences\u2003of\u2003human\u2003\u03b1-CGRP\u2003fragments\u2003(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NOS:\u200315-40)\u2003andrelated\u2003peptides\u2003(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NOS:\u200341-47).\u2003All\u2003peptides\u2003are\u2003C-terminallyamidated\u2003except\u2003SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NOS:\u200336-40.\u2003Residues\u2003in\u2003bold\u2003indicate\u2003pointmutations.CGRPAmino\u2003acid\u2003sequenceSEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO\u20031-37\u2003(WT)ACDTATCVTHRLAGLLSRSGGVVKNNFVPTNVGSKAF15 \u20038-37VTHRLAGLLSRSGGVVKNNFVPTNVGSKAF16 19-37SGGVVKNNFVPTNVGSKAF17 P29A\u2003(19-37)SGGVVKNNFVATNVGSKAF18 K35A\u2003(19-37)SGGVVKNNFVPTNVGSAAF19 K35E\u2003(19-37)SGGVVKNNFVPTNVGSEAF20 K35M\u2003(19-37)SGGVVKNNFVPTNVGSMAF21 K35Q\u2003(19-37)SGGVVKNNFVPTNVGSQAF22 F37A\u2003(19-37)SGGVVKNNFVPTNVGSKAA23 25-38ANNFVPTNVGSKAFA24 25-37NNFVPTNVGSKAF25 F27A\u2003(25-37)NNAVPTNVGSKAF26 V28A\u2003(25-37)NNFAPTNVGSKAF27 P29A\u2003(25-37)NNFVATNVGSKAF28 T30A\u2003(25-37)NNFVPANVGSKAF29 N31A\u2003(25-37)NNFVPTAVGSKAF30 V32A\u2003(25-37)NNFVPTNAGSKAF31 G33A\u2003(25-37)NNFVPTNVASKAF32 S34A\u2003(25-37)NNFVPTNVGAKAF33 F37A\u2003(25-37)NNFVPTNVGSKAA34 26-37NFVPTNVGSKAF35 19-37-COOHSGGVVKNNFVPTNVGSKAF36 19-36-COOHSGGVVKNNFVPTNVGSKA37 \u20031-36-COOHACDTATCVTHRLAGLLSRSGGVVKNNFVPTNVGSKA38 \u20031-19-COOHACDTATCVTHRLAGLLSRS39 \u20031-13-COOHACDTATCVTHRLA40 rat\u2003\u03b1 (1-37)SCNTATCVTHRLAGLLSRSGGVVKDNFVPTNVGSEAF41 rat\u2003\u03b1 (19-37)SGGVVKDNFVPTNVGSEAF42 human\u2003\u03b2 (1-37)ACNTATCVTHRLAGLLSRSGGMVKSNFVPTNVGSKAF43 rat\u2003\u03b2 (1-37)SCNTATCVTHRLAGLLSRSGGVVKDNFVPTNVGSKAF44 Human\u2003calcitoninCGNLSTCMLGTYTQDFNKFHTFPQTAIGVGAP45(1-32) Human\u2003amylin\u2003KCNTATCATQRLANFLVHSSNNFGAILSSTNVGSNTY46(1-37) HumanYRQSMNNFQGLRSFGCRFGTCTVQKLAHQIYQFTDK47adrenomedullinDKDNVAPRSKISPQGY(1-52)</p>Example 2: Screening of Anti-CGRP Antagonist Antibodies Using In Vitro AssaysMurine anti-CGRP antibodies were further screened for antagonist activity in vitro using cell based cAMP activation assay and binding assay.</p>Antagonist activity measured by cAMP assay. Five microliters of human or rat \u03b1-CGRP (final concentration 50 nM) in the presence or absence of an anti-CGRP antibody (final concentration 1-3000 nM), or rat \u03b1-CGRP or human \u03b1-CGRP (final concentration 0.1 nM-10 \u03bcM; as a positive control for c-AMP activation) was dispensed into a 384-well plate (Nunc, Cat. No. 264657). Ten microliters of cells (human SK-N-MC if human \u03b1-CGRP is used, or rat L6 from ATCC if rat \u03b1-CGRP is used) in stimulation buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 146 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 500 uM 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX)) were added into the wells of the plate. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 30 min.</p>After the incubation, cAMP activation was performed using HitHunter\u2122 Enzyme Fragment Complementation Assay (Applied Biosystems) following manufacture's instruction. The assay is based on a genetically engineered \u03b2-galactosidase enzyme that consists of two fragments\u2014termed Enzyme Acceptor (EA) and Enzyme Donor (ED). When the two fragments are separated, the enzyme is inactive. When the fragments are together they can recombine spontaneously to form active enzyme by a process called complementation. The EFC assay platform utilizes an ED-cAMP peptide conjugate in which cAMP is recognized by anti-cAMP, This ED fragment is capable of reassociation with EA to form active enzyme. In the assay, anti-cAMP antibody is optimally titrated to bind ED-cAMP conjugate and inhibit enzyme formation. Levels of cAMP in cell lysate samples compete with ED-cAMP conjugate for binding to the anti-cAMP antibody. The amount of free ED conjugate in the assay is proportional to the concentration of cAMP. Therefore, cAMP is measured by the formation of active enzyme that is quantified by the turnover of \u03b2-galactosidase luminescent substrate. The cAMP activation assay was performed by adding 10 \u03bcl of lysis buffer and anti-cAMP antibody (1:1 ratio) following by incubation at room temperature for 60 min. Then 10 \u03bcl of ED-cAMP reagent was added into each well and incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature. After the incubation, 20 \u03bcl of EA reagent and CL mixture (containing the substrate) (1:1 ratio) was added into each well and incubated for 1-3 hours or overnight at room temperature. The plate was read at 1 second/well on PMT instrument or 30 seconds/place on imager. The antibodies that inhibit activation of cAMP by \u03b1-CGRP were identified (referred to as \u201cyes\u201d) in Tables 2 and 3 above. Data in Tables 2 and 3 indicate that antibodies that demonstrated antagonist activity in the assay generally have high affinity. For example, antibodies having K<sub>D </sub>(determined at 25\u00b0 C.) of about 80 nM or less to human \u03b1-CGRP or having K<sub>D </sub>(determined at 37\u00b0 C.) of about 47 nM or less to rat \u03b1-CGRP showed antagonist activity in this assay.</p>Radioligand binding assay. Binding assay was performed to measure the IC<sub>50 </sub>of anti-CGRP antibody in blocking the CGRP from binding to the receptor as described previously. Zimmermann et al., Peptides 16:421-4, 1995; Mallee et al., J. Biol. Chem. 277:14294-8, 2002. Membranes (25 \u03bcg) from SK-N-MC cells were incubated for 90 min at room temperature in incubation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCL, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCL<sub>2</sub>, 0.1% BSA) containing 10 pM <sup>125</sup>I-human \u03b1-CGRP in a total volume of 1 mL. To determine inhibition concentrations (IC<sub>50</sub>), antibodies or unlabeled CGRP (as a control), from a about 100 fold higher stock solution were dissolved at varying concentrations in the incubation buffer and incubated at the same time with membranes and 10 pM <sup>125</sup>I-human \u03b1-CGRP. Incubation was terminated by filtration through a glass microfiber filter (GF/B, 1 \u03bcm) which had been blocked with 0.5% polyethylemimine. Dose response curves were plotted and K<sub>i </sub>values were determined by using the equation: K<sub>i</sub>=IC<sub>50</sub>/(1+([ligand]/K<sub>D</sub>); where the equilibrium dissociation constant K<sub>D</sub>=8 pM for human \u03b1-CGRP to CGRP1 receptor as present in SK-N-MC cells, and B<sub>max</sub>=0.025 pmol/mg protein. The reported IC<sub>50 </sub>value (in terms of IgG molecules) was converted to binding sites (by multiplying it by 2) so that it could be compared with the affinities (K<sub>D</sub>) determined by Biacore (see Table 2).</p>Table 2 shows the IC<sub>50 </sub>of murine antibodies 7E9, 8B6, 6H2 and 4901. Data indicate that antibody affinity generally correlates with IC<sub>50</sub>: antibodies with higher affinity (lower K<sub>D </sub>values) have lower IC<sub>50 </sub>in the radioligand binding assay.</p>Example 3: Effect of Anti-CGRP Antagonist Antibodies on Skin Vasodilatation Induced by Stimulation of Rat Saphenous NerveTo test antagonist activity of anti-CGRP antibodies, effect of the antibodies on skin vasodilatation by stimulation of rat saphenous nerve was tested using a rat model described previously. Escott et al., Br. J. Pharmacol. 110:772-776, 1993. In this rat model, electrical stimulation of saphenous nerve induces release of CGRP from nerve endings, resulting in an increase in skin blood flow. Blood flow in the foot skin of male Sprague Dwaley rats (170-300 g, from Charles River Hollister) was measured after saphenous nerve stimulation. Rats were maintained under anesthesia with 2% isoflurane. Bretylium tosylate (30 mg/kg, administered i.v.) was given at the beginning of the experiment to minimize vasoconstriction due to the concomitant stimulation of sympathetic fibers of the saphenous nerve. Body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0 C. by the use of a rectal probe thermostatically connected to a temperature controlled heating pad. Compounds including antibodies, positive control (CGRP 8-37), and vehicle (PBS, 0.01% Tween 20) were given intravenously through the right femoral vein, except for the experiment shown in FIG. 3, the test compound and the control were injected through tail vein, and for experiments shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B, antibodies 4901 and 7D11 were injected intraperitoneally (IP). Positive control compound CGRP 8-37 (vasodilatatio",
    "ing the binding kinetics of antibody G1 Fab fragments or variants titrated across the CGRP or fragment on the chip. All Biacore assays were conducted in HBS-EP running buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% v/v polysorbate P20). CGRP surfaces were prepared by diluting the N-biotinylated CGRP to a concentration of less than 0.001 mg/mL into HBS-EP buffer and injecting it across the SA sensor chip using variable contact times. Low capacity surfaces, corresponding to capture levels &lt;50 response units (RU) were used for high-resolution kinetic studies, whereas high capacity surfaces (about 800 RU of captured CGRP) were used for concentration studies, screening, and solution affinity determinations. Kinetic data were obtained by diluting antibody G1 Fab serially in two- or three-fold increments to concentrations spanning 1 uM-0.1 nM (aimed at 0.1-10\u00d7 estimated K<sub>D</sub>). Samples were typically injected for 1 minute at 100 \u03bcL/min and dissociation times of at least 10 minutes were allowed. After each binding cycle, surfaces were regenerated with 25 mM NaOH in 25% v/v ethanol, which was tolerated over hundreds of cycles. An entire titration series (typically generated in duplicate) was fit globally to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model using the BIAevaluation program. This returned a unique pair of association and dissociation kinetic rate constants (respectively, k<sub>on </sub>and k<sub>off</sub>) for each binding interaction, whose ratio gave the equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>=k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>). Affinities (K<sub>D </sub>values) determined in this way are listed in Tables 6 and 7.</p>High-resolution analysis of binding interactions with extremely slow offrates. For interactions with extremely slow offrates (in particular, antibody G1 Fab binding to human \u03b1-CGRP on the chip at 25\u00b0 C.), affinities were obtained in a two-part experiment. The protocol described above was used with the following modifications. The association rate constant (k<sub>on</sub>) was determined by injecting a 2-fold titration series (in duplicate) spanning 550 nM-1 nM for 30 sec at 100 uL/min and allowing only a 30 sec dissociation phase. The dissociation rate constant (k<sub>off</sub>) was determined by injecting three concentrations (high, medium, and low) of the same titration series in duplicate for 30 sec and allowing a 2-hour dissociation phase. The affinity (K<sub>D</sub>) of each interaction was obtained by combining the k<sub>on </sub>and k<sub>off </sub>values obtained in both types of experiments, as shown in Table 5.</p>Determining solution affinity by Biacore. The solution affinity of antibody G1 for rat \u03b1-CGRP and F37A (19-37) human \u03b1-CGRP was measured by Biacore at 37\u00b0 C. A high capacity CGRP chip surface was used (the high-affinity human \u03b1-CGRP was chosen for detection purposes) and HBS-EP running buffer was flowed at 5 uL/min.
