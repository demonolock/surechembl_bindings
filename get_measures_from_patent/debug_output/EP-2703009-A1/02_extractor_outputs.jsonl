{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nThe term \"specifically binds\", \"specific binding\" or the like, mean that an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof forms a complex with an antigen that is relatively stable under physiologic conditions. Specific binding can be characterized by an equilibrium dissociation constant of at least about 1x10<sup>-6</sup> M or less (e.g., a smaller K<sub>D</sub> denotes a tighter binding).\nThe term \"K<sub>D</sub> \", as used herein, is intended to refer to the equilibrium dissociation constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction. The equilibrium dissociation constant is typically measured in \"mol/L\" (abbreviated as \"M\").\nThe term \"high affinity\" antibody refers to those mAbs having a binding affinity to hPCSK9 of at least 10<sup>-10</sup> M; preferably 10<sup>-11</sup> M; even more preferably 10<sup>-12</sup> M, as measured by surface plasmon resonance, e.g., BIACORE\u2122 or solution-affinity ELISA.\nBy the term \"slow off rate\", \"Koff\" or \"kd\" is meant an antibody that dissociates from hPCSK9 with a rate constant of 1 x 10<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> or less, preferably 1 x 10<sup>-4</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> or less, as determined by surface plasmon resonance, e.g., BIACORE\u2122."}
