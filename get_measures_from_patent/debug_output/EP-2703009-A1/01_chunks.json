Nothing herein is to be construed as an admission that the invention is not entitled to antedate such disclosure by virtue of prior invention. Some of the documents cited herein are characterized as being \"incorporated by reference\". In the event of a conflict between the definitions or teachings of such incorporated references and definitions or teachings recited in the present specification, the text of the present specification takes precedence.</p>Sequences: All sequences referred to herein are disclosed in the attached sequence listing that, with its whole content and disclosure, is a part of this specification.</p>The term \"about\" when used in connection with a numerical value is meant to encompass numerical values within a range having a lower limit that is 5% smaller than the indicated numerical value and having an upper limit that is 5% larger than the indicated numerical value.</p>The term \"human proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9\" or \"hPCSK9\", as used herein, refers to hPCSK9 having the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 754 and the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 755, or a biologically active fragment thereof.</p>The terms \"specifically binds\", \"specific binding\" or the like, mean that an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof forms a complex with an antigen that is relatively stable under physiologic conditions. Specific binding can be characterized by an equilibrium dissociation constant of at least about 1x10<sup>-6</sup> M or less (e.g., a smaller K<sub>D</sub> denotes a tighter binding). Methods for determining whether two molecules specifically bind are well known in the art and include, for example, equilibrium dialysis, surface plasmon resonance, and the like. An isolated antibody that specifically binds hPCSK9 may, however, exhibit cross-reactivity to other antigens such as PCSK9 molecules from other species. Moreover, multi-specific antibodies (e.g., bispecifics) that bind to hPCSK9 and one or more additional antigens are nonetheless considered antibodies that \"specifically bind\" hPCSK9, as used herein.</p>The term \"K<sub>D</sub> \", as used herein, is intended to refer to the equilibrium dissociation constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction. The equilibrium dissociation constant is typically measured in \"mol/L\" (abbreviated as \"M\").</p>By the term \"slow off rate\", \"Koff\" or \"kd\" is meant an antibody that dissociates from hPCSK9 with a rate constant of 1 x 10<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> or less, preferably 1 x 10<sup>-4</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> or less, as determined by surface plasmon resonance, e.g., BIACORE\u2122.</p>The term \"high affinity\" antibody refers to those mAbs having a binding affinity to hPCSK9 of at least 10<sup>-10</sup> M; preferably 10<sup>-11</sup> M; even more preferably 10<sup>-12</sup> M, as measured by surface plasmon resonance, e.g., BIACORE\u2122 or solution-affinity ELISA.</p>The term \"surface plasmon resonance\", as used herein, refers to an optical phenomenon that allows for the analysis of real-time biospecific interactions by detection of alterations in protein concentrations within a biosensor matrix, for example using the BIACORE\u2122 system (Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden and Piscataway, N.J.).</p>An \"epitope\", also known as antigenic determinant, is the region of an antigen that is recognized by the immune system, specifically by antibodies, B cells, or T cells. As used herein, an \"epitope\" is the part of an antigen capable of binding to an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof as described herein. In this context, the term \"binding\" preferably relates to a \"specific binding\", as defined herein. Epitopes usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids, sugar side chains, phosphoryl groups, or sulfonyl groups and may have specific three-dimensional structural characteristics an",
    "e test antibody may bind to the same epitope as the epitope bound by the reference anti-PCSK9 antibody of the invention.</p>To determine if an antibody competes for binding with a reference anti-PCSK9 antibody, the above-described binding methodology is performed in two orientations: In a first orientation, the reference antibody is allowed to bind to a PCSK9 molecule under saturating conditions followed by assessment of binding of the test antibody to the PCSK9 molecule. In a second orientation, the test antibody is allowed to bind to a PCSK9 molecule under saturating conditions followed by assessment of binding of the reference antibody to the PCSK9 molecule. If, in both orientations, only the first (saturating) antibody is capable of binding to the PCSK9 molecule, then it is concluded that the test antibody and the reference antibody compete for binding to PCSK9. As will be appreciated by a person of ordinary skill in the art, an antibody that competes for binding with a reference antibody may not necessarily bind to the identical epitope as the reference antibody, but may sterically block binding of the reference antibody by binding an overlapping or adjacent epitope.</p>Two antibodies bind to the same or overlapping epitope if each competitively inhibits (blocks) binding of the other to the antigen. That is, a 1-, 5-, 10-, 20- or 100-fold excess of one antibody inhibits binding of the other by at least 50% but preferably 75%, 90% or even 99% as measured in a competitive binding assay (see, e.g., Junghans et al., Cancer Res. 1990 50:1495-1502). Alternatively, two antibodies have the same epitope if essentially all amino acid mutations in the antigen that reduce or eliminate binding of one antibody reduce or eliminate binding of the other. Two antibodies have overlapping epitopes if some amino acid mutations that reduce or eliminate binding of one antibody reduce or eliminate binding of the other.</p>Additional routine experimentation (e.g., peptide mutation and binding analyses) can then be carried out to confirm whether the observed lack of binding of the test antibody is in fact due to binding to the same epitope as the reference antibody or if steric blocking (or another phenomenon) is responsible for the lack of observed binding. Experiments of this sort can be performed using ELISA, RIA, surface plasmon resonance, flow cytometry or any other quantitative or qualitative antibody-binding assay available in the art.</p>In a specific embodiment, the invention comprises an anti-PCSK9 antibody or antigen binding fragment of an antibody that binds an PCSK9 protein of SEQ ID NO:755, wherein the binding between the antibody or fragment thereof to PCSK9 and a variant PCSK9 protein is less than 50% of the binding between the antibody or fragment and the PCSK9 protein of SEQ ID NO:755. In one specific embodiment, the variant PCSK9 protein comprises at least one mutation of a residue at a position selected from the group consisting of 153, 159, 238 and 343. In a more specific embodiment, the at least one mutation is S153R, E159R, D238R, and/or D343R. In another specific embodiment, the variant PCSK9 protein comprises at least one mutation of a residue at a position selected from the group consisting of 366. In one specific embodiment, the variant PCSK9 protein comprises at least one mutation of a residue at a position selected from the group consisting of 147, 366 and 380. In a more specific embodiment, the mutation is S147F, E366K and V380M.</p>ImmunoconjugatesThe invention encompasses a human anti-PCSK9 monoclonal antibody conjugated to a therapeutic moiety (\"immunoconjugate\"), such as a cytotoxin, a chemotherapeutic drug, an immunosuppressant or a radioisotope. Cytotoxin agents include any agent that is detrimental to cells. Examples of suitable cytotoxin agents and chemotherapeutic agents for forming immunoconjugates are known in the art, see for example, WO"
