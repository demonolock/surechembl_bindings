Such agents include inhibitors of inhibitors of EGFR (for example gefitinib and erlotinib), inhibitors of ERB-2 (for example trastuzumab), inhibitors of IGFR, inhibitors of CD20 (rituximab), inhibitors of cytokine receptors, inhibitors of MET, inhibitors of PI3K (for example LY294002), serine/threonine kinases (including but not limited to inhibitors of Akt such as described in (WO 03/086404, WO 03/086403, WO 03/086394, WO 03/086279, WO</p>02/083675, WO 02/083139, WO 02/083140 and WO 02/083138), inhibitors of Raf kinase (for example BAY-43-9006 ), inhibitors of MEK (for example CI- 1040 and PD-098059) and inhibitors of mTOR (for example Wyeth CCI-779 and Ariad AP23573). Such agents include small molecule inhibitor compounds and antibody antagonists. \"Apoptosis inducing agents\" include activators of TNF receptor family members</p>(including the TRAIL receptors).</p>The invention also encompasses combinations with NSAID's which are selective COX-2 inhibitors. For purposes of this specification NSAID's which are selective inhibitors of COX-2 are defined as those which possess a specificity for inhibiting COX-2 over COX-I of at least 100 fold as measured by the ratio of IC50 for COX-2 over IC50 for COX-I evaluated by cell or microsomal assays.

    "ut MP-Carbonate scavenging \n\nresin (285 mg, 0.825 mmol) was then added and stirred overnight at room temperature. The mixture was then filtered from scavenging resin and concentrated. Added dichloromethane (1 mL) and stirred, then treated with trifluoroacetic acid (1 mL). The reaction mixture was concentrated after 2 hours of stirring at room temperature and the crude residue was purified by reverse-phase chromatography (5-70-95% acetonitrile/water with 0.1% formic acid). The appropriate fractions were combined and lyophilized.

The enzyme source for this assay was an epitope-tagged human HDACl complex immuno-purified from stably expressing mammalian cells. The substrate consisted of a commercial product containing an acetylated lysine side chain (BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA). Upon deacetylation of the substrate by incubation with the purified HDACl complex, a fluorophore is produced that is directly proportional to the level of deacetylation. Using a substrate concentration at the Km for the enzyme preparation, the deacetylation assay was performed in the presence of increasing concentrations of novel compounds to semi-quantitatively determine the concentration of compound required for 50% inhibition (IC50) of the deacetylation reaction. The compounds of the instant invention described in the Examples and Tables above exhibit histone deacetylase inhibitory activity at concentrations of less than about 1 \u03bcM.</p>EXAMPLE 9 HDAC Inhibition in Cell Lines - ATP Assay</p>The novel compounds of the present invention were tested for their ability to inhibit proliferation of the human cervical cancer (HeLa) and colon carcinoma (HCTl 16) cells.</p>In this assay, also referred to as the Vialight Assay, cellular ATP levels are measured as a means of quantifying cellular proliferation. This assay makes use of a bio luminescent method from Cambrex (ViaLight PLUS, cat. #LT07-121). In the presence of ATP, luciferase converts luciferin to oxyluciferin and light. The amount of light produced (emission at 565nM) is measured and correlates with a relative amount of proliferation. Human cervical cancer (HeLa) or colon carcinoma (HCTl 16) cells were incubated with vehicle or increasing concentrations of compound for 48, 72 or 96 hours. Cell proliferation was quantified by adding the cell lysis reagent (provided in the Vialight assay kit) directly to culture wells, followed by addition of the \n\nATP-monitoring reagent (containing luciferase/luciferin). The amount of light produced is then measured (emission at 565nM). The quantity of light produced, as measured by 565nM absorbance, is directly proportional to the number of living cells in culture.</p>While this invention has been particularly show"
