In the chimeric transactivation assay Compound 2 of the present disclosure was found to have an EC50 value of 180 nanomolar with 75 % efficiency at the RARα receptors, and in the ligand binding assay a Kd value of 5 nmolar.\n2. For RARβ and RARγ receptors Compound 2 was found to be inactive as an agonist, with an EC50 values greater than 10 nanomolar.\n3. The IC50 value is defined as the concentration of competing ligand needed to reduce specific binding by 50%.\n4. The Kd values were determined by application of the Cheng-Prussof equation to the IC50 values, the labeled ligand concentration and the Kd of the labeled ligand.\n5. The results obtained in this assay are expressed in EC50 numbers, as they are also in the chimeric receptor transactivation assay.\n6. The results of the PGR assay are also expressed in EC50 numbers (nanomolar concentration).\n7. The results of ligand binding assay are expressed in Kd numbers.\n\nNote that sentence 3 does not contain a specific molecule name, but sentence 1 and 2 do, and they contain all the required components. Sentence 4, 5, 6, and 7 do not contain a specific molecule name, but they are related to the metrics and are useful for context. However, according to the instructions, I should only return sentences that contain all four components. Therefore, I will remove sentences 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 from the list.\n\nHere is the updated list:\n\n1.
