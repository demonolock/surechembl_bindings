RAR\u03b1 SPECIFIC OR SELECTIVE COMPOUNDS USED IN THE INVENTION, ASSAYS TO ESTABLISH SELECTIVITY RAR\u03b1 specific and or RAR\u03b1 selective compounds can be obtained, for example, as described in United States Patent Nos. 5,856,490 and 5,965,606, the specifications of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference. These references also present data to show that the compounds are indeed RAR\u03b1 specific or selective agonists. Assays by which a compound can be tested and established whether or not it is an RAR\u03b1 specific or selective agonist, are known in the art and are described in numerous prior art publications and patents. For example, a chimeric receptor transactivation assay which tests for agonist-like activity in the RAR<sub>\u03b1</sub>, RAR<sub>\u03b2</sub>, RAR<sub>\u03b3</sub>, RXR<sub>\u03b1</sub> receptor subtypes, and which is based on work published by Feigner P. L. and Holm M. (1989) Focus, 112 is described in detail in United States Patent No. 5,455,265. The specification of United States Patent No. 5,455,265 is hereby expressly incorporated by reference. A holoreceptor transactivation assay and a ligand binding assay which measure the antagonist/agonist like activity of the compounds of the invention, or their ability to bind to the several retinoid receptor subtypes, respectively, are described in published PCT Application No. WO \n\nW093/11755 (particularly on pages 30 - 33 and 37 - 41) published on June 24, 1993, the specification of which is also incorporated herein by reference. A description of the ligand binding assay is also provided below. LIGAND BINDING ASSAY All binding assays were performed in a similar fashion. All six receptor types were derived from the expressed receptor type (RAR \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and RXR \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) expressed in Baculovirus. Stock solutions of all compounds were prepared as 10 mM ethanol solutions and serial dilutions carried out into 1:1 DMSO; ethanol. Assay buffers consisted of the following for all six receptor assays: 8% glycerol. 120 mM KC1. 8 mM Tris. 5 mM CHAPS 4 mM DTT and 0.24 mM PMSF. \u03c1H-7.4@ room temperature. All receptor biding assays were performed in the same manner. The final assay volume was 250 \u03bcl and contained from 10-40 \u03bcg of extract protein depending on receptor being assayed along with 5 nM of [<sup>3</sup>H] all-trans retinoic acid or 10 nM [<sup>3</sup>H] 9-cis retinoic acid and varying concentrations of competing ligand at concentrations that ranged from 0-10<sup>\"5</sup>M. The assays were formatted for a 96 well minitube system. Incubations were carried out at 4\u00b0 C. until equilibrium was achieved. Non-specific binding was defined as that binding remaining in the presence of 1000 nM of the appropriate unlabeled retinoic acid isomer. At the end of the incubation period. 50 \u03bcl of 6.25% hydroxyapitite was added in the appropriate wash buffer. The wash buffer consisted of 100 mM KC1. 10 mM Tris and either 5 mM CHAPS (RXR \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) or 0.5% Triton X-100 (RAR \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3). The mixture was vortexed and incubated for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0 C, centrifuged and the supernatant removed. The hydroxyapitite was washed three more times with the appropriate wash buffer. The receptor-ligand complex was adsorbed by the hydroxyapitite. The amount of receptor-ligand complex was determined by liquid scintillation counting of hydroxyapitite pellet. \n\n After correcting for non-specific binding, IC<sub>50</sub> values were determined. The IC<sub>50</sub> value is defined as the concentration of competing ligand needed to reduce specific binding by 50%. The IC<sub>50</sub> value was determined graphically from a loglogit plot of the data. The K<sub>d</sub> values were determined by application of the Cheng-Prussof equation to the IC<sub>50</sub> values, the labeled ligand concentration and the K<sub>d</sub> of the labeled ligand. The results of ligand binding assay are expressed in K<sub>d</sub> numbers. (See Cheng et al. Biochemical Pharmacology Vol. 22 pp 3099-3108, expressly incorporated herein by reference.) A detailed experimental procedure for holoreceptor transactivations has been described by Heyman et al. Cell 68, 397 - 406, (1992); Allegretto et al. J. Biol. Chem. 268, 26625 - 26633, and Mangelsdorf et al. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine, pp 319 - 349, Raven Press Ltd., New York, which are expressly incorporated herein by reference. The results obtained in this assay are expressed in EC<sub>50</sub> numbers, as they are also in the chimeric receptor transactivation assay. In the chimeric transactivation assay Compound 2 of the present disclosure was found to have an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 180 nanomolar witith 75 % efficiency at the RAR\u03b1 receptors, and in the ligand binding assay a K<sub>d</sub> value of 5 nmolar. For RAR\u03b2 and RAR\u03b3 receptors Compound 2 was found to be inactive as an agonist, with an EC<sub>50</sub> values greater than 10 nanomolar. Still another transactivation assay, the \"PGR assay\" is described in the publication Klein et al. J. Biol. Chem. 271, 22692-22696 (1996) which is expressly incorporated herein by reference, and a detailed description is also provided below. The results of the PGR assay are also expressed in EC<sub>50</sub> numbers (nanomolar concentration). RAR-P-GR Holoreceptor Transactivation Assay CV-1 cells (4 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well) were transiently transfected with the luciferase reporter plasmid MTV-4(R5G)-Luc (0.7 ug/well) containing four \n\ncopies of the R5G retinoid DNA response element along with the RXR\u03b1 expression plasmid pRS-hRXR\u03b1 (0.1 ug/well) and one of the RAR-P-GR expression plasmids (0.05 ug/well) in 12 well plates via calcium phosphate precipitation Chen et al. (1987) Mol. Cell. Biol. 7, 2745-2752 as described by Klein et al. in J. Biol. Chem. 271, 22692, referenced above. The three different RAR-P-GR expression plasmids, pRS-RAR\u03b1-P-GR, pcDNA3- RAR\u03b2-P-GR and pcDNA3-RAR\u03b3-P-GR, express RAR\u03b1, RAR\u03b2 and RAR\u03b3 receptors, respectively, which contain modified DNA binding domains such that their \"P-boxes\" have been altered to that of the glucocorticoid receptor. These RAR-P-GR receptors bind to DNA as heterodimeric complexes with RXR. Specifically, the RAR-P-GR receptors bind retinoic acid respon"
