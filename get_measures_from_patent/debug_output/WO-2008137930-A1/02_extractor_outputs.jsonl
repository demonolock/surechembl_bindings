{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nBinding constants (Kd) can be measured using fluorescence polarization. \nThe K<sub>d</sub> values of competitive inhibitors are calculated using the newly derived equation described based upon the measured IC<sub>50</sub> values, the K<sub>d</sub> value of the probe and IAP BIR3 complex, and the concentrations of the protein and probe in the competition assay.\n\n\nNote that these sentences do not contain specific molecule names, numeric values, and units as required. However, after re-examining the text, I found a sentence that contains some of the required information:\n\n\nBriefly, varying concentrations of an IAP antagonist are mixed with 5 nM fluorescently labeled peptide {e.g., AbuRPF-K(5-Fam)-NH<sub>2</sub>) and 40 nM of an IAP-BIR3 for 15 minutes at RT in 100 \u03bcL of 0.1M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 containing 100 \u03bcg/ml bovine \u03b3-globulin.\n\n\nThis sentence contains a specific molecule name (IAP antagonist, IAP-BIR3), a numeric value (5 nM, 40 nM), and a unit (nM). However, it does not contain a bioactivity metric like IC50, Ki, Kd, or EC50.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the provided text snippet does not contain many sentences that meet all the required criteria. If you have more text or context, I may be able to extract more relevant information."}
