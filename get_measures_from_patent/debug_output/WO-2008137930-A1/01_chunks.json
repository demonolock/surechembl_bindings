The BIR domains of XIAP, cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 bind to caspases, the key effector proteases of apoptosis, and XIAP has been shown to be a potent physiological inhibitor of caspase 9 and caspase 3.</p>[45] However, cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 were originally identified by their association with TNF-R2 via TRAFl and TRAF2 and while they may bind to caspases 7 and 9, they cannot directly inhibit their proteolytic activity. It has therefore been suggested that they might regulate apoptosis indirectly, by influencing signaling pathways elicited by the TNF receptor superfamily.</p>[46] Natural antagonists of IAPs include Grim in Drosophila and Smac/DIABLO in mammals. These proteins have been shown to bind to the same groove in the BIRs of XIAP as caspases, and can thereby antagonize XIAP anti-caspase activity in vitro. To mimic the cIAP antagonists, compounds have been designed to prevent XIAP from inhibiting caspases, thereby causing cancer cells to undergo apoptosis. Because XIAP inhibits caspases that are activated by Apaf-1 and cytochrome c, but not caspase 8, cell death caused by cIAP antagonists alone would be expected to be relatively unaffected by the caspase 8 inhibitor crmA.</p>[47] Binding constants (Kd) can be measured using fluorescence polarization. Briefly, varying concentrations of an IAP antagonist are mixed with 5 nM fluorescently labeled peptide {e.g., AbuRPF-K(5-Fam)-NH<sub>2</sub>) and 40 nM of an IAP-BIR3 for 15 minutes at RT in 100 \u03bcL of 0.1M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 containing 100 \u03bcg/ml bovine \u03b3-globulin. Following incubation, the polarization values (mP) are measured on a ViCtOr<sup>2</sup>V using a 485nm excitation filter and a 520nm emission filter. IC<sub>5O</sub> values are determined from the \n\n plot using nonlinear least-squares analysis using, for example, GraphPad Prism (San Diego, CA). The K<sub>d</sub> values of competitive inhibitors are calculated using the newly derived equation described based upon the measured IC<sub>50</sub> values, the K<sub>d</sub> value of the probe and IAP BIR3 complex, and the concentrations of the protein and probe in the competition assay.</p>EXAMPLE 2</p>[48] The IAP family of proteins suppresses apoptosis by preventing the activation of procaspases and inhibiting the enzymatic activity of mature caspases. Several distinct mammalian IAPs including XIAP, cIAP-1, cIAP-2, ML-IAP, NAIP (neuronal apoptosis inhibiting protein), Bruce, and survivin, have been identified, and they all exhibit anti- apoptotic activity in cell culture.</p>[49] Smac is synthesized in the cytoplasm with an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence that is proteolytically removed during maturation to the mature polypeptide and is then "
