    "195 \u03bc\u0399/well wash buffer (1 xPBS, 0.05% Tween 20) followed by a 1 h blocking at room temperature with 195 \u03bc\u0399/well 3%BSA in 1x PBS solution. After 3 washing steps the specific antibody, the anti-His antibody (anti-His) as well as the anti-gpUL75 (anti-gH) in a concentration of 1 g/ml in 3%BSA, 1x PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7 was added (100 \u03bc\u0399/well) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature followed by further 3 wash steps. For detection a 1 h incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody (anti-mouse-lgG-HRP, 1 :1000 dilution in 3%BSA, 1x PBS, 0.05% Tween20, pH 7) was conducted. The binding of the specific antibody to the pentameric complex was detected using 100 \u03bc\u0399/well TMP substrate reagent (BD Biosciences, San Diego, USA; according to manufacturer<sup>'</sup>s protocol), wherefore the reaction is stopped after 3-15 min with 100 \u03bc\u0399 1 M HCI, followed by OD measurement at 450 nm in a microplate reader. </p>Example 7: Visual verification of generated assemblies by electron microscopy </p>To verify the shape of the purified VLPs, electron microscopy was performed. A 10 \u03bc\u0399 drop of VLP sample was incubated 10 min on a copper covered EM grid, stained with 5 \u03bc\u0399 phosphor tungsten acid for 5-10 min and de-stained 2 times with water for 1 min. The liquid on the grid was removed with a Whatman paper and the grid was transferred to the JEOL3000 microscope, investigated and pictures of the particles taken. </p>Example 8: Binding assays by the use of sandwich ELISA </p>A sandwich ELISA as binding assay was performed to determine the presence and accessibility of the surface proteins of different reVLPs (recombinant VLPs). Therefore a \n\n specific surface and/or tegument antibody in a concentration of 1 \u03bcg ml in 3%BSA, 1 x PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7 was added (100 \u03bc\u0399/well) in coating buffer (0.1 M Na<sub>2</sub>HP0<sub>4</sub>, pH 9) in a 96-well pre-absorbed ELISA plate and incubated over night at 4\u00b0C. Afterwards the plate was washed 3x with 195 \u03bc\u0399/well wash buffer (1 xPBS, 0.05% Tween 20) followed by a 1 h blocking at room temperature with 195 \u03bc\u0399/well 3% BSA in 1x PBS solution. After 3 washing steps the different VLPs in a 1 :10 dilution in 3% BSA, 1 x PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7 were added (100 \u03bc\u0399/well) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After 3 washing steps the specific antibody, the anti-surface antibody (anti-gH, anti-gB) as well as the anti- tegument antibody (anti-UL83) in a concentration of 1 \u03bc\u03c2/\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u0399 in 3% BSA, 1 x PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7 were added (100 \u03bc\u0399/well) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature followed by further 3 wash steps. For detection a 1 h incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody (anti-mouse-lgG-HRP, 1 :1000 dilution in 3% BSA, 1 x PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7) was conducted. The binding of the specific antibody to the VLP was detected using 100 \u03bc\u0399/well TMP substrate reagent (BD Biosciences, San Diego, USA; according to manufacturer<sup>'</sup>s protocol). The reaction is stopped after 3-15 min with 100 \u03bc\u0399 1 M HCI, follo",
    "20, emission 530/25), bottom reading mode, time: 0.1 sec, 25x measurements/well after 96 h incubation. The neutralization potency was determined as the dilution of the sera able to show a 50% virus infection inhibition. The following controls were performed: cell control (cells + PBS), virus control (only infected cells) and 5 CMV positive and 5 CMV negative sera from human blood donors. </p>Example 1 1 : Cellular immune response based on EliSpot data (Multiplex assay). </p> At day 85 of the in vivo study (Example 9) mice were killed and the spleenocytes prepared for the analysis of 10 different cytokines. For the restimulation of the spleenocytes the</p>CMV-reVLP as well as mixes of synthetic peptides were used. The following proteins were verified: HIVgag, pUL83, gpUL75, gpUL1 15, gpUL55, gpUL128, gpUL130 and gpUL131A.</p>An epitope prediction of each protein was done using several bioinformatics algorithms.</p>For each protein a mix of 4 peptides were generated for the restimulation of the spleenocytes. For HIVgag a commercially available peptide mix of 130 peptides (JPT,</p>Berlin) was used. The cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, gCMSF and TNFalpha) were investigated by a multiplex assay kit from Invitrogen according to the manufacturer's protocol. Example 12: Binding assays based on reaction of antibodies present in CMV positive blood serum </p> To characterize the different CMV VLPs and soluble complexes as part of a vaccine a double binding assay in a sandwich ELISA format was performed. The presence and accessibility of capsid, tegument and surface proteins of different reVLPs was investigated by a combination of purified monoclonal antibodies and antibodies present in a sera-mix of HCMV positive blood donors. Therefore the anti-CMV monoclonal antibodies such as anti-gH, anti-gB, anti-UL83, anti-UL86, anti-UL85, anti-UL130/UL131A, anti-gag, anti-His were diluted to a final concentration of ^g/ml coating buffer (0.1 0.1 M Na<sub>2</sub>HP0<sub>4</sub>, pH 9) in a 96 well pre-absorbed ELISA plate (1 \u039f\u039f\u03bc\u0399/well) and incubated over night at 4\u00b0C. </p>Afterwards the plate was washed 3x with 195 \u03bc\u0399/well wash buffer (1 x PBS, 0.05% Tween 20) followed by a 1 h blocking at room temperature with 195 \u03bc\u0399/well 3% BSA in 1 x PBS \n\n solution. After 3 washing steps the different CMV VLPs and soluble complex in a 1 :10 dilution in 3% BSA, 1 x PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7 were added (100 \u03bc\u0399/well) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After 3 washing steps a mix of 4 CMV positive human sera was added in a 1 :300 dilution in 3% BSA, 1 x PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7 (100 \u03bc\u0399/well) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature followed by further 3 wash steps. For detection a 1 h incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody (anti-human-lgG- HRP, 1 :1000 dilution in 3% BSA, 1 x PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7) was conducted. The binding of the antibodies present in the human sera to the proteins composing VLPs and soluble complex was"
