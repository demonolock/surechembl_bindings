    "ptide fragment that contains at least one CDR of an immunoglobulin heavy and/or light chains that binds to the antigen of interest, for instance, the human Her2/neu protein. In this regard, an antigen-binding fragment of the herein described antibodies may comprise 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, or all 6 CDRs of a VH and VL sequence from antibodies that bind to a therapeutic or diagnostic target, such as human Her2/neu. </p> The term \"antigen\" refers to a molecule or a portion of a molecule capable of being bound by a selective binding agent, such as an antibody, and additionally capable of being used in an animal to produce antibodies capable of binding to an epitope of that antigen. An antigen may have one or more epitopes. </p> The term \"epitope\" includes any determinant, preferably a polypeptide determinant, capable of specific binding to an immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor. An epitope is a region of an antigen that is bound by an antibody. In certain embodiments, epitope determinants include chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids, sugar side chains, phosphoryl or sulfonyl, and may in certain embodiments have specific three-dimensional structural characteristics, and/or specific charge characteristics. In certain embodiments, an antibody is said to specifically bind an antigen when it preferentially recognizes its target antigen in a complex mixture of proteins and/or macromolecules. An antibody is said to specifically bind an antigen when the equilibrium dissociation constant is &lt;10<sup>\"7</sup> or 10<sup>\"8</sup> M. In some embodiments, the equilibrium dissociation constant may be &lt;10<sup>\"9</sup> M or &lt;10<sup>\"10</sup> M. </p> In certain embodiments, antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof as described herein include a heavy chain and a light chain CDR set, respectively interposed between a heavy chain and a light chain framework region (FR) set which provide support to the CDRs and define the spatial relationship of the CDRs relative to each other. As used herein, the term \"CDR set\" refers to the three hypervariable regions of a heavy or light chain V region. Proceeding from the N-terminus of a heavy or light chain, these regions are denoted as \"CDR1 ,\" \"CDR2,\" and \"CDR3\" respectively. An antigen-binding site, therefore, includes six CDRs, comprising the CDR set from each of a \n\n heavy and a light chain V region. A polypeptide comprising a single CDR, (e.g., a CDR1 , CDR2 or CDR3) is referred to herein as a \"molecular recognition unit.\" Crystallographic analysis of a number of antigen-antibody complexes has demonstrated that the amino acid residues of CDRs form extensive contact with bound antigen, wherein the most extensive antigen contact is with the heavy chain CDR3. Thus, the molecular recognition units are primarily responsible for the specificity of an antigen-binding site. </p> As used herein, the term \"FR set\" refers to the four flanking amino acid sequences which frame the CDRs of a CDR set of a heavy or light chain V region. Some FR residues may contact bound antigen; however, FRs are primarily re",
    "r affinity with a particular cell or substance than it does with alternative cells or substances. An antibody \"specifically binds\" or \"preferentially binds\" to a target if it binds with greater affinity, avidity, more readily, and/or with greater duration than it binds to other \n\n substances. For example, an antibody that specifically or preferentially binds to a specific epitope is an antibody that binds that specific epitope with greater affinity, avidity, more readily, and/or with greater duration than it binds to other epitopes. It is also understood by reading this definition that, for example, an antibody (or moiety or epitope) that specifically or preferentially binds to a first target may or may not specifically or preferentially bind to a second target. As such, \"specific binding\" or \"preferential binding\" does not necessarily require (although it can include) exclusive binding. Generally, but not necessarily, reference to binding means preferential binding. </p> Immunological binding generally refers to the non-covalent interactions of the type which occur between an immunoglobulin molecule and an antigen for which the immunoglobulin is specific, for example by way of illustration and not limitation, as a result of electrostatic, ionic, hydrophilic and/or hydrophobic attractions or repulsion, steric forces, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, and other interactions. The strength, or affinity of immunological binding interactions can be expressed in terms of the dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) of the interaction, wherein a smaller K<sub>d</sub> represents a greater affinity. </p>Immunological binding properties of selected polypeptides can be quantified using methods well known in the art. One such method entails measuring the rates of antigen- binding site/antigen complex formation and dissociation, wherein those rates depend on the concentrations of the complex partners, the affinity of the interaction, and on geometric parameters that equally influence the rate in both directions. Thus, both the \"on rate constant\" (K<sub>on</sub>) and the \"off rate constant\" (K<sub>off</sub>) can be determined by calculation of the concentrations and the actual rates of association and dissociation. The ratio of K<sub>off</sub> /K<sub>on</sub> enables cancellation of all parameters not related to affinity, and is thus equal to the dissociation constant K<sub>d</sub>.

Biochem. </p>59:439-473. </p> In certain embodiments, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof specifically binds to a cancer-associated antigen, or cancer antigen. Exemplary cancer antigens include cell surface proteins such as cell surface receptors. Also included as cancer-associated antigens are ligands that bind to such cell surface proteins or receptors. \n\n In specific embodiments, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment specifically binds to a intracellular cancer antigen. </p> In some embodiments, the cancer that associates with the cancer antigen is one or more of breast cancer, metastatic brain cancer, prostate cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, testicular cancer, head and neck cancer, stomach cancer, bladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, kidney cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, CNS or brain cancer, melanoma, non-melanoma cancer, thyroid cancer, endometrial cancer, epithelial tumor, bone cancer, or a hematopoietic cancer. </p> In particular embodiments, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment specifically binds to at least one cancer antigen selected from human Her2/neu, Her1/EGF receptor, Her3, A33 antigen, CD5, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD23 (IgE Receptor), C242 antigen, 5T4, IL-6, IL-13, vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF (e.g., VEGF-A) VEGFR-1 , VEGFR-2, CD30, CD33, CD37, CD40, CD44, CD51 , CD52, CD56, CD74, CD80, CD152, CD200, CD221 "
