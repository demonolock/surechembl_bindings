In vitro studies have suggested that using a conditionally replicating oncolytic virus such as CG0070 could be an effective strategy for treating bladder cancer. Ramesh N, Ge Y, Ennist D L, Zhu M, Mina M, Ganesh S, Reddy P S, Yu D C. CG0070, a conditionally replicating granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor-armed oncolytic adenovirus for the treatment of bladder cancer. Clin Cancer Res. 2006; 12:305-13. However, the unexpected efficacy of CG0070 in certain patient populations and the effect of certain dosing regimens as described herein were previously unknown. The methods are bladder-preserving, highly efficacious and well-tolerated in bladder cancer, including those that have previously failed standard-of-care therapies. In a Phase II clinical trial, inventors surprisingly found that 72.2% of patients with pure CIS, who had previously failed BCG therapy, had complete response (CR) after 6 months of intravesical ",
