    "hod or use of some embodiments, the compound that inhibits integrin signaling comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of Tysabri (natalizumab) or an antigen binding fragment thereof. In the method or use of some embodiments, the compound that inhibits integrin signaling is a compound other than Tysabri (natalizumab). In the method or use some embodiments, the compound that inhibits integrin signaling comprises, consists of, or consists essentially of Tysabri\u00ae (natalizumab) formulated for administration into the CSF of the subject or as an ointment to the head of the subject. In the method or use of some embodiments, the compound that inhibits integrin signaling comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of ReoPro\u00ae (Abcizimab), Vedolizumab, etrolizumab, anti-av integrin, or Volocixmab, or a combination of two or more of these. In the method or use of some embodiments, the compound that inhibits integrin signaling is ReoPro\u00ae (Abcizimab), Vedolizumab, etrolizumab, anti-av integrin, or Volocixmab. In the method or use of some embodiments, the compound that inhibits integrin signaling is a compound other than ReoPro\u00ae (Abcizimab), Vedolizumab, etrolizumab, anti-av integrin, or Volocixmab.</p>In methods, uses, compositions, and pharmaceutical compositions of some embodiments, the anti-CD49a antibody as described herein binds to and inhibits the activity of</p>CD49a by at least 50% (e.g., 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or greater, including any increment therein). The apparent inhibition constant (Ki<sup>app </sup>or K<sub>i,app</sub>), which provides a measure of inhibitor potency, is related to the concentration of inhibitor required to reduce target (e.g., CD49a) activity and is not dependent on target concentrations. The inhibitory activity of an anti-CD49a antibody described herein can be determined by methods known in the art. In some embodiments, the anti-CD49a binds to CD49a with a dissociation constant K<sub>D </sub>that is numerically lower (indicating tighter binding than) 10<sup>\u22121</sup>, 10<sup>\u22122</sup>, 10<sup>\u22123</sup>, 10<sup>\u22124</sup>, 10<sup>\u22125</sup>, 10<sup>\u22126</sup>, 10<sup>\u22127</sup>, 10<sup>\u22128</sup>, 10<sup>\u22129</sup>, 10<sup>\u221210</sup>, 10<sup>\u221211</sup>, or 10<sup>\u221212</sup>, including ranges between any two of the listed values. A K<sub>D </sub>can be determined using methods known in the art, for example surface plasmon resonance on a BIACORE apparatus.</p>The K<sub>i,</sub><sup>aPP </sup>value of an antibody may be determined by measuring the inhibitory effect of different concentrations of the antibody on the extent of the reaction (e.g., target activity such as CD49a activity); fitting the change in pseudo-first order rate constant (v) as a function of inhibitor concentration to the modified Morrison equation (Equation 1) yields an estimate of the apparent Ki value. For a competitive inhibitor, the Ki<sup>app </sup>can be obtained from the y-intercept extracted from a linear regression analysis of a plot of K<sub>i,</sub><sup>app </sup>versus substrate concentration.</p>v=A\u00b7([E]-[I]-Kiapp)+([E]-[I]-Kiapp)2+4\u2061[E]\u00b7\u2062Kiapp2(Equation\u2062\u20621)</p>Where A is equivalent to v<sub>o</sub>/E, the initial velocity (v<sub>o</sub>) of the enzymatic reaction in the absence of inhibitor (I) divided by the total enzyme concentration (E).</p>In some embodiments, the anti-CD49a antibody described herein has a Kiapp value of 1000, 900, 800, 700, 600, 500, 400, 300, 200, 100, 50, 40, 30, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 pM or less for the target antigen or antigen epitope, such as an epitope of CD49a. Differences in Kiapp (e.g., for specificity or other comparisons) can be at least 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 37.5, 50, 70, 80, 91, 100, 500, 1000, 10,000 or 105 fold. In some examples, the anti-CD49a antibody inhibits a first antigen (e.g., a first protein in a first conformation or mimic thereof) better relative to a second antigen (e.g., the same first protein in a second conformation or mimic thereof; or a second protein). In some embodiments, any of the anti-CD49a antibodies may be further affinity matured to reduce the Kiapp of the antibody to the target antigen or antigenic epitope thereof.</p>In methods, uses, compositions, and pharmaceutical compositions of some embodiments, the anti-CD49a antibody suppresses or inhibits integrin signaling triggered by CD49a by at"
