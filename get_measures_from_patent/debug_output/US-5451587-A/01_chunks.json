The conversion into the corresponding thioethers--starting from the mercaptans--often has already taken place in weakly alkaline solution, c.f. A. Schoberl and A. Wagner in Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie (Methods of Organic Chemistry), Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart (1955), page 93 et seq., it being possible to dispense with the protective group required for the oxygen ethers.</p>The compounds of the general formula I have useful pharmacological properties. Thus, in bonding studies the compounds exhibit affinities for muscarine receptors and muscarine-agonistic GTP shifts (GTP=guanosine triphosphate) (Birdsall, N.I.M., E. C. Hulme and I. M.
