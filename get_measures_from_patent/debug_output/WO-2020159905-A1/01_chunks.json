A2A Tag-lite\u00ae HTRF Assay </p> Assays were conducted in black low volume 384-well polystyrene plates (Greiner 784076-25) in a final volume of 10 mL. Test compounds were first serially diluted in DMSO and 100 nl added to the plate wells before the addition of other reaction components. The final concentration of DMSO was 1%. Tag-lite\u00ae Adenosine A2A labeled cells (CisBio C1TT1A2A) were diluted 1:5 into Tag-lite buffer (CisBio LABMED) and spun 1200 g for 5 mins. The pellet was resuspended at a volume 10.4 X the initial cell suspension volume in Tag-lite buffer, and Adenosine A2A Receptor Red antagonist fluorescent ligand (CisBio L0058RED) added at 12.5 nM final concentration.10 ul of the cell and ligand mix was added to the assay wells and incubated at room temperature for 45 minutes before reading on a PHERAstar FS plate reader (BMG Labtech) with HTRF 337/620/665 optical module. Percent binding of the fluorescent ligand was calculated; where 100 nM of A2A antagonist control \n\n ZM 241385 (Tocris 1036) displaces the ligand 100% and 1% DMSO has 0% displacement. The % binding data versus the log of the inhibitor concentration was fitted to a one-site competitive binding model (GraphPad Prism version 7.02) where the ligand constant = 12.5 nM and the ligand Kd = 1.85 nM.

Example E. A1 and A3 SPA Binding Assays </p> Both assays are conducted in white 384-well polystyrene plates (Greiner 781075) in a final volume of 50 mL. Inhibitors are first serially diluted in DMSO and 100 nL is added to the plate wells before the addition of other reaction components. The final concentration of DMSO is 2%. </p> Wheatgerm agglutinin-coated yttrium silicate SPA beads (Perkin Elmer RPNQ0023) and CHO-K1 cell membranes overexpressing each human adeonsine receptor are incubated in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA (Assay buffer) on a rotary stirrer for 2 hours at 4<sup>0</sup>C. The beads are pelleted by centrifugation at 6000 g for one minute, and then the \n\n supernatant with unbound membrane is discarded. The beads are re-suspended to the original volume in assay buffer. Each radioligand is diluted in assay buffer + 22% DMSO at 12.2X the final concentration, and then added to the SPA bead suspension.50 ml of the SPA bead reaction mix is added to the assay wells and the plates shaken at 600 rpm for 1 hour at room temperature. The beads are then allowed to settle for 1 hour before reading on a Topcount NXT FS (Perkin Elmer). Percent binding of the radiolabeled ligand is calculated, where a control at &gt;100X Ki displaces the ligand 100% and 2% DMSO has 0% displacement.
