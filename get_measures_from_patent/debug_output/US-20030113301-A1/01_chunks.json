    "i-LFA-3 can be obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md. In a preferred embodiment, the antibody is PT85. </p>[0077] A suitable antibody, or fragment or derivative thereof, for use in the invention can be identified based upon its ability to inhibit the immunological rejection of allogeneic or xenogeneic cells. Briefly, the antibody (or antibody fragment) is incubated for a short period of time (e.g., 30 minutes at room temperature) with cells or tissue to be transplanted and any unbound antibody is washed away. The cells or tissue are then transplanted into a recipient animal. The ability of the antibody pretreatment to inhibit or prevent rejection of the transplanted cells or tissue is then determined by monitoring for rejection of the cells or tissue compared to untreated controls. </p>[0078] It is preferred that an antibody, or fragment or derivative thereof, which is used to alter an antigen have an affinity for binding to the antigen of at least 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>M. The affinity of an antibody or other molecule for binding to an antigen can be determined by conventional techniques (see Masan, D. W. and Williams, A. F. (1980) Biochem. J. 187:1-10). Briefly, the antibody to be tested is labeled with <sup>125</sup>I and incubated with cells expressing the antigen at increasing concentrations until equilibrium is reached. Data are plotted graphically as [bound antibody]/[free antibody] versus [bound antibody] and the slope of the line is equal to the kD (Scatchard analysis). </p>[0079] Other molecules which bind to an antigen on a donor cell and produce a functionally similar result as antibodies, or fragments or derivatives thereof, (e.g., other molecules which interfere with the interaction of the antigen with a hematopoietic cell and induce immunological nonresponsiveness) can be used to alter the antigen on the donor cell. One such molecule is a soluble form of a ligand for an antigen (e.g., a receptor) on the donor cell which could be used to alter the antigen on the donor cell. For example, a soluble form of CD2 (i.e., comprising the extracellular domain of CD2 without the transmembrane or cytoplasmic domain) can be used to alter LFA-3 on the donor cell by binding to LFA-3 on donor cells in a manner analogous to an antibody. Alternatively, a soluble form of LFA-1 can be used to alter ICAM-1 on the donor cell. A soluble form of a ligand can be made by standard recombinant DNA procedures, using a recombinant expression vector containing DNA encoding the ligand encompassing an extracellular domain (i.e., lacking DNA encoding the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains). The recombinant expression vector encoding the extracellular domain of the ligand can be introduced into host cells to produce a soluble ligand, which can then be isolated. Soluble ligands of use have a binding affinity for the receptor on the donor cell sufficient to remain bound to the receptor to interfere with immunological recognition and induce non-",
    "ell further can be altered by using two or more molecules which bind to the same or different antigen. For example, two different antibodies with specificity for two different epitopes on the same antigen can be used (e.g., two different anti-MHC class I antibodies can be used in combination). Alternatively, two different types of molecules which bind to the same antigen can be used (e.g., an anti-MHC class I antibody and an MHC class I-binding peptide). A preferred combination of anti-MHC class I antibodies which can be used with human cells is the W6/32 antibody and the PT85 antibody or F(ab\u2032)<sub>2 </sub>fragments thereof. When the donor cell to be administered to a subject bears more than one hematopoietic cell-interactive antigen, two or more treatments can be used together. For example, two antibodies, each directed against a different antigen (eg., an anti-MHC class I antibody and an anti-ICAM-1 antibody) can be used in combination or two different types of molecules, each binding to a different antigen, can be used (e.g., an anti-ICAM-1 antibody and an MHC class I-binding peptide). Alternatively, polyclonal antisera generated against the entire donor cell or tissue containing donor cells can be used, following removal of the Fc region, to alter multiple cell surface antigens of the donor cells. </p>[0082] The ability of two different monoclonal antibodies which bind to the same antigen to bind to different epitopes on the antigen can be determined using a competition binding assay. Briefly, one monoclonal antibody is labeled and used to stain cells which express the antigen. The ability of the unlabeled second monoclonal antibody to inhibit the binding of the first labeled monoclonal antibody to the antigen on the cells is then assessed. If the second monoclonal antibody binds to a different epitope on the antigen than does the first antibody, the second antibody will be unable to competitively inhibit the binding of the first antibody to the antigen. </p>[0083] A preferred method for altering at least two different epitopes on an antigen on a donor cell to inhibit an immune response against the cell is to contact the cell with at least two different molecules which bind to the epitopes. It is preferred that the cell be contacted with at least two different molecules which bind to the different epitopes prior to administering the cell to a recipient (i.e., the cell is contacted with the molecule in vitro). For example, the cell can be incubated with the molecules which bind to the epitopes under conditions which allow binding of the molecules to the epitopes and then any unbound molecules can be removed. Following administration of the donor cell to a recipient, the molecules remain bound to the epitopes on the surface antigen for a sufficient time to interfere with immunological recognition by host cells and induce non-responsiveness in the recipient. </p>[0084] Alternative to binding a molecule (e.g., an antibody) to an antigen on a don"
