    "sing orally administering to the individual a prophylactically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising an ASIC1a inhibitor capable of penetrating the blood-brain barrier.</p>ASIC inhibitors, amiloride and amiloride analogs</p>The term \"ASIC 1 a\" as used herein refers to ASIC1a proteins or channels from any species. The expression \"ASIC 1a inhibitor\" refers to a product that inhibits the acid sensing ion channel1a (acid sensing ion channel1 a; ASIC1 a). For example, an exemplary human ASIC1a protein/channel is described in Waldmann et al, 1997, Nature 386, pages 173 to 177.</p>ASIC1a inhibitors may be selective within the ASIC family. As used herein, selective inhibition of ASIC1a refers to substantially greater inhibition of ASIC1a than other ASIC family members when compared (e.g., in cultured cells) after exposure of each of ASIC1a and the other ASIC family members to the same (sub-maximal) concentration of inhibitor. The inhibitor can selectively inhibit ASIC1a relative to at least one other ASIC family member (ASIClb, ASIC2a, ASIC2b, ASIC3, ASIC4, etc.) and/or relative to each other ASIC family member. The inhibitory intensity of a selective inhibitor can be measured as the concentration of inhibitor at which inhibition occurs (e.g., IC) relative to the concentration of the inhibitor at which inhibition occurs for different ASIC family members<sub>50</sub>(concentration of inhibitor at which 50% of the maximum inhibition occurs) or K<sub>i</sub>Value (inhibition constant or dissociation constant)). The ASIC1a selective inhibitor may inhibit ASIC1a activity at a concentration that is at least about two, four or ten times lower (half, quarter or tenth or lower concentration) than at least one or every other ASIC family member. Thus, as compared to suppressing at least one other ASIC family memberAnd/or inhibiting IC inhibition of ASIC1a by ASIC1a Selective inhibitor for every other ASIC family Member<sub>50</sub>And/or K<sub>i</sub>And may be at least about two, four, ten or twenty times lower (half, quarter, tenth, twentieth or less of the concentration).</p>Thus, IC of ASIC1a specific inhibitor versus ASIC1a<sub>50</sub>And/or K<sub>i</sub>May be at least about 20-fold lower (5% or less) relative to each other member of the ASIC family, such that, for example, inhibition of the other ASIC family members is at least substantially (or completely) undetectable. In some embodiments, the ASIC1a selective inhibitor has increased potency and increased aqueous solubility for the homologous poly (homomeric) ASIC1a channel as compared to any commercially available amiloride-related ASIC1a inhibitor.</p>In one embodiment, the ASIC1a inhibitor is selected from the group consisting of amiloride, an amiloride analog, and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof.</p>In one embodiment, the ASIC1a inhibitor is amiloride or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof. Amiloride is a pyrazine derivative containing a guanidine group, and has "
