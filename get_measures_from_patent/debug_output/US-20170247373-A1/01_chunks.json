Therefore, single stereochemical isomers as well as enantiomeric, diastereomeric, and geometric (or conformational) mixtures of the present compounds are within the scope of the invention. Unless otherwise stated, all tautomeric forms of the compounds of the invention are within the scope of the invention. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also meant to include compounds that differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms. For example, compounds having the present structures including the replacement of hydrogen by deuterium or tritium, or the replacement of a carbon by a <sup>13</sup>C- or <sup>14</sup>C-enriched carbon are within the scope of this invention. Such compounds are useful, for example, as analytical tools, as probes in biological assays, or as therapeutic agents in accordance with the present invention. In certain embodiments, a warhead moiety, R<sup>1</sup>, of a provided compound comprises one or more deuterium atoms. In certain embodiments, Ring B of a provided compound may be substituted with one or more deuterium atoms.</p>As used herein, the term \u201cinhibitor\u201d is defined as a compound that binds to and/or inhibits TYK2 with measurable affinity. In certain embodiments, an inhibitor has an IC<sub>50 </sub>and/or binding constant of less than about 50 \u03bcM, less than about 1 \u03bcM, less than about 500 nM, less than about 100 nM, less than about 10 nM, or less than about 1 nM.</p>A compound of the present invention may be tethered to a detectable moiety. It will be appreciated that such compounds are useful as imaging agents. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that a detectable moiety may be attached to a provided compound via a suitable substituent. As used herein, the term \u201csuitable substituent\u201d refers to a moiety that is capable of covalent attachment to a detectable moiety. Such moieties are well known to one of ordinary skill in the art and include groups containing, e.g., a carboxylate moiety, an amino moiety, a thiol moiety, or a hydroxyl moiety, to name but a few. It will be appreciated that such moieties may be directly attached to a provided compound or via a tethering group, such as a bivalent saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon chain. In some embodiments, such moieties may be attached via click chemistry. In some embodiments, such moieties may be attached via a 1,3-cycloaddition of an azide with an alkyne, optionally in the presence of a copper catalyst. Methods of using click chemistry are known in the art and include those described by Rostovtsev et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2002, 41, 2596-99 and Sun et al., Bioconjugate Chem., 2006, 17, 52-57.</p>As used herein, the term \u201cdetectable moiety\u201d is used interchangeably with the term \u201clabel\u201d and relates to any moiety",

For JAK2 (Invitrogen) kinase assay the peptide substrate poly[Glu:Tyr](4:1), 0.2 mg/ml is used, in the reaction carried out the same as for TYK2.</p>Example 240: Tyk2 &amp; JAK2 Caliper AssayThe caliper machine employs an off chip mobility shift assay to detect phosphorylated peptide substrates from kinase assays, using microfluidics technology. The assays are carried out at ATP concentration equivalent to the ATP Km, and at 1 mM ATP. Compounds are serially diluted in DMSO then further diluted in assay buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.01% Brij-35, 0.01% Triton, 0.5 mM EGTA). 5 ul of diluted compound was added into wells first, then 10 ul of enzyme mix was added into wells, followed by 10 uL of substrate mix (peptide and ATP in 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) to start reaction. Reaction was incubated at 28\u00b0 C. for 25 min and then added 25 ul stop buffer (100 mM HEPES, 0.015% Brij-35, 50 mM EDTA), followed by reading with Caliper. JAK2 at 1 nM final concentration and TYK2 at 9.75 nM are from Carna, and substrates used are ATP at 20 and 16 uM, respectively. JAK2 assay uses peptide 22 and TYK2 uses peptide 30 (Caliper), each at 3 uM.</p>Table 2 shows the activity of selected compounds of this invention in the Tyk2 and JAK2 activity inhibition assay.
