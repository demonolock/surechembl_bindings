    "sistance between the pipette and the cell interior (the series resistance, Rs) was measured and compensated for. The cell capacitances ranged from 5 to 20 pF, and the series resistance was in the range 3 to</p>\n  6 M\u03a9. Rs- as well as capacitance compensation were updated during the experiments</p>\n  (before each stimulus). Leak-subtractions were not performed. The extracellular (bath) solution contained (in mM): 156 KCI, 0.1 CaCI<sub>2</sub>, 3</p>\n  MgCI<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES (pH = 7.4 with KOH). The test compound was dissolved in DMSO and then diluted at least 1000 times in the extracellular solution. \n\n The intracellular (pipette) solution contained: 154 mM KCI, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM EGTA. Concentrations of CaCI<sub>2</sub> and MgCI<sub>2</sub> needed to obtain the desired free concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (0.3 - 0.4 \u03bcM, Mg<sup>2+</sup> always 1 mM) were calculated by EqCaI software (Cambridge, UK) and added. After establishment of the whole-cell configuration, voltage-ramps (-80 to</p>\n  +80 mV) were applied to the cell every 5 seconds from a holding potential of 0 mV. A stable baseline current was obtained within a period of 100-500 seconds, and the compound was then added by changing to an extracellular solution containing the test compound. Activity was quantified from the change in current at -75 mV. For inhibitors a K<sub>d</sub> value, defined as the concentration required for decreasing the baseline current to 50% of the initial current, was estimated.</p>\n  The Kd values determined for Compound 7 and Compound 15, considered representative of the compounds of the invention, are in the sub-micromolar range (i.e. below 1 \u03bcM), which is an indication of their strong SK3 activating properties. \n</p>\n"
