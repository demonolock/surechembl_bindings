    " be performed using conventional methodology, or based on in vivo testing using appropriate animal models, as described elsewhere herein.</p>Advances in mouse genetics have resulted in a number of mouse models for studying different diseases in humans, such as pathological processes mediated by APOC3 expression. Such models are used for in vivo testing of dsRNA, as well as for determining therapeutically effective doses. A suitable mouse model is, for example, a mouse comprising a plasmid expressing human APOC 3. Another suitable mouse model is a transgenic mouse carrying a transgene expressing human APOC 3.</p>The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosages for use in humans. The dosage of the compositions characterized in this invention generally lies within a circulating concentration range that includes ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the methods characterized by the present invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be initially estimated from cell culture assays. A dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range for the compound, or, where appropriate, a circulating plasma concentration range for the polypeptide product of a target sequence (e.g., to achieve a reduced concentration of the polypeptide), which includes IC50 (i.e., the concentration at which the test compound achieves half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. This information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma can be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.</p>The dsrnas characterized in the present invention may be administered in combination with other known agents effective in treating pathological processes mediated by target gene expression. In any event, the administering physician can adjust the amount and timing of dsRNA administration based on the results observed using standard therapeutic efficacy measurements known in the art or described herein.</p>Administration of</p>The invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions and formulations comprising the dsRNA compounds characterized by the invention. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be administered in a number of ways depending on whether local or systemic treatment is desired and depending on the area to be treated. Administration can be topical (including buccal and sublingual); of the lung; for example by inhalation or insufflation of powders or aerosols, including by nebulizer; in the trachea; intranasal; epidermal and transdermal, oral or parenteral. Parenteral administration includes intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal or intramuscular injection or infusion; or intracranial, e.g., intraparenchymal, intratheca",
    "argeted to IL1 \u03b2 (e.g., anakinra), IL6 (tacitumumab), or TNF (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, or certolizumab ozogamicin).</p>Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., to determine LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index, and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED 50. Those compounds that exhibit a high therapeutic index are preferred.</p>The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosages for use in humans.

These methods include: contacting the cell with the dsRNA of the invention and maintaining the cell for a time sufficient to obtain degradation of the mRNA transcript of the APOC3 gene, thereby inhibiting expression of the APOC3 gene in the cell. The reduction in gene expression can be assessed by any method known in the art. For example, a decrease in expression of APOC3 can be determined by: the mRNA expression level of APOC3 is determined using methods conventional to those of or",
