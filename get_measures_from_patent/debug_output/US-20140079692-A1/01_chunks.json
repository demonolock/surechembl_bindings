    " receptor (EGFR), comprising administering to a human or animal presenting the disorders a therapeutically effective amount of an antibody that binds ErbB2. More specifically, the invention concerns the treatment of human patients susceptible to or diagnosed with cancer overexpressing ErbB2 or expressing EGFR, where the treatment is with an anti-ErbB2 antibody administered by front loading the dose of antibody during treatment by intravenous and/or subcutaneous administration. The invention optionally includes treatment of cancer in a human patient with a combination of an anti-ErbB2 antibody and a chemotherapeutic agent, such as, but not limited to, a taxoid. The taxoid may be, but is not limited to paclitaxel or docetaxel. The invention further includes treatment of cancer in a human patient with a combination of anti-ErbB2 antibody and a chemotherapeutic agent, such as, but not limited to, an anthracycline derivative. Optionally, treatment with a combination of anti-ErbB2 and an anthracycline derivative includes treatment with an effective amount of a cardioprotectant. The present invention further concerns infrequent dosing of anti-ErbB2 antibodies.</p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONProto-oncogenes that encode growth factors and growth factor receptors have been identified to play important roles in the pathogenesis of various human malignancies, including breast cancer. It has been found that the human ErbB2 gene (erbB2, also known as her2, or c-erbB-2), which encodes a 185-kd transmembrane glycoprotein receptor (p 185<sup>HER2</sup>) related to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is overexpressed in about 25% to 30% of human breast cancer (Slamon et al., Science 235:177-182 [1987]; Slamon et al., Science 244:707-712 [1989]).</p>Several lines of evidence support a direct role for ErbB2 in the pathogenesis and clinical aggressiveness of ErbB2-overexpressing tumors. The introduction of ErbB2 into non-neoplastic cells has been shown to cause their malignant transformation (Hudziak et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:7159-7163 [1987]; DiFiore et al., Science 237:78-182 [1987]). Transgenic mice that express HER2 were found to develop mammary tumors (Guy et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10578-10582 [1992]).</p>Antibodies directed against human erbB2 protein products and proteins encoded by the rat equivalent of the erbB2 gene (neu) have been described. Drebin et al., Cell 41:695-706 (1985) refer to an IgG2a monoclonal antibody which is directed against the rat neu gene product. This antibody called 7.16.4 causes down-modulation of cell surface p185 expression on B104-1-1 cells (NIH-3T3 cells transfected with the neu proto-oncogene) and inhibits colony formation of these cells. In Drebin et al. PNAS (USA) 83:9129-9133 (1986), the 7.16.4 antibody was shown to inhibit the tumorigenic growth of neu-transformed NIH-3T3 cells as well as rat neuroblastoma cells (from which the neu oncogene was initially isolated) implanted into nude mice.

    "rypan blue (see Moore et al. Cytotechnology 17:1-11 [1995]) or 7AAD can be assessed relative to untreated cells. Preferred cell death-inducing antibodies are those which induce PI uptake in the \u201cPI uptake assay in BT474 cells\u201d.</p>The phrase \u201cinduces apoptosis\u201d or \u201ccapable of inducing apoptosis\u201d refers to the ability of the antibody to induce programmed cell death as determined by binding of annexin V, fragmentation of DNA, cell shrinkage, dilation of endoplasmic reticulum, cell fragmentation, and/or formation of membrane vesicles (called apoptotic bodies). The cell is one which overexpresses the ErbB2 receptor. Preferably the \u201ccell\u201d is a tumor cell, e.g. a breast, ovarian, stomach, endometrial, salivary gland, lung, kidney, colon, thyroid, pancreatic or bladder cell. In vitro, the cell may be a SKBR3, BT474, Calu 3 cell, MDA-MB-453, MDA-MB-361 or SKOV3 cell. Various methods are available for evaluating the cellular events associated with apoptosis. For example, phosphatidyl serine (PS) translocation can be measured by annexin binding; DNA fragmentation can be evaluated through DNA laddering as disclosed in the example herein; and nuclear/chromatin condensation along with DNA fragmentation can be evaluated by any increase in hypodiploid cells. Preferably, the antibody which induces apoptosis is one which results in about 2 to 50 fold, preferably about 5 to 50 fold, and most preferably about 10 to 50 fold, induction of annexin binding relative to untreated cell in an \u201cannexin binding assay using BT474 cells\u201d (see below).</p>Sometimes the pro-apoptotic antibody will be one which blocks HRG binding/activation of the ErbB2/ErbB3 complex (e.g. 7F3 antibody). In other situations, the antibody is one which does not significantly block activation of the ErbB2/ErbB3 receptor complex by HRG (e.g. 7C2). Further, the antibody may be one like 7C2 which, while inducing apoptosis, does not induce a large reduction in the percent of cells in S phase (e.g. one which only induces about 0-10% reduction in the percent of these cells relative to control).</p>The antibody of interest may be one like 7C2 which binds specifically to human ErbB2 and does not significantly cross-react with other proteins such as those encoded by the erbB1, erbB3 and/or erbB4 genes. Sometimes, the antibody may not significantly cross-react with the rat neu protein, e.g., as described in Schecter et al. Nature 312:513 (1984) and Drebin et al., Nature 312:545-548 (1984). In such embodiments, the extent of binding of the antibody to these proteins (e.g., cell surface binding to endogenous receptor) will be less than about 10% as determined by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis or radioimmunoprecipitation (RIA).</p>\u201cHeregulin\u201d (HRG) when used herein refers to a polypeptide which activates the ErbB2-ErbB3 and ErbB2-ErbB4 protein complexes (i.e. induces phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the complex upon binding thereto). Various heregulin polypeptides encompassed by this t",
    " contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, parental myeloma cells. For example, if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT medium), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.</p>Preferred myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level production of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. Among these, preferred myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines, such as those derived from MOPC-21 and MPC-11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif. USA, and SP-2 or X63-Ag8-653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md. USA. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor, J. Immunol., 133:3001 (1984); Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp. 51-63 [Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987]).</p>Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA).</p>The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson et al., Anal. Biochem., 107:220 (1980).</p>After hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity, affinity, and/or activity, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, pp. 59-103 [Academic Press, 1986]). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, D-MEM or RPMI-1640 medium. In addition, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal.</p>The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium, ascites fluid, or serum by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography.</p>DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as E. coli cells, simian COS ",
    "AD uptake is assessed relative to control. The preferred assay is the \u201cPI uptake assay using BT474 cells\u201d. According to this assay, BT474 cells (which can be obtained from the American Type Culture Collection [Rockville, Md.]) are cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (D-MEM):Ham's F-12 (50:50) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Hyclone) and 2 mM L-glutamine. (Thus, the assay is performed in the absence of complement and immune effector cells). The BT474 cells are seeded at a density of 3\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>per dish in 100\u00d720 mm dishes and allowed to attach overnight. The medium is then removed and replaced with fresh medium alone or medium containing 10 \u03bcg/ml of the appropriate MAb. The cells are incubated for a 3 day time period. Following each treatment, monolayers are washed with PBS and detached by trypsinization. Cells are then centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 minutes at 4\u00b0 C., the pellet resuspended in 3 ml ice cold Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) and aliquoted into 35 mm strainer-capped 12\u00d775 tubes (1 ml per tube, 3 tubes per treatment group) for removal of cell clumps. Tubes then receive PI (10 \u03bcg/ml). Samples may be analyzed using a FACSCAN\u2122 flow cytometer and FACSCONVERT\u2122 CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). Those antibodies which induce statistically significant levels of cell death as determined by PI uptake are selected.</p>In order to select for antibodies which induce apoptosis, an \u201cannexin binding assay using BT474 cells\u201d is available. The BT474 cells are cultured and seeded in dishes as discussed in the preceding paragraph. The medium is then removed and replaced with fresh medium alone or medium containing 10 \u03bcg/ml of the MAb. Following a three day incubation period, monolayers are washed with PBS and detached by trypsinization. Cells are then centrifuged, resuspended in Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding buffer and aliquoted into tubes as discussed above for the cell death assay. Tubes then receive labeled annexin (e.g. annexin V-FTIC) (1 \u03bcg/ml). Samples may be analyzed using a FACSCAN\u2122 flow cytometer and FACSCONVERT\u2122 CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). Those antibodies which induce statistically significant levels of annexin binding relative to control are selected as apoptosis-inducing antibodies.</p>In addition to the annexin binding assay, a \u201cDNA staining assay using BT474 cells\u201d is available. In order to perform this assay, BT474 cells which have been treated with the antibody of interest as described in the preceding two paragraphs are incubated with 9 \u03bcg/ml HOECHST 33342\u2122 for 2 hr at 37\u00b0 C., then analyzed on an EPICS ELITE\u2122 flow cytometer (Coulter Corporation) using MODFIT LT\u2122 software (Verity Software House). Antibodies which induce a change in the percentage of apoptotic cells which is 2 fold or greater (and preferably 3 fold or greater) than untreated cells (up to 100% apoptotic cells) may be selected as pro-apoptotic antibodies using this assay.</p>To screen for antibodies which bind to an epitope on ErbB2 bound by an antibody of interest, a routine cross-blocking assay such as that described in Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988), can be performed. Alternatively, epitope mapping can be performed by methods known in the art.</p>To identify anti-ErbB2 antibodies which inhibit growth of SKBR3 cells in cell culture by 50-100%, the SKBR3 assay described in WO 89/06692 can be performed. According to this assay, SKBR3 cells are grown in a 1:1 mixture of F12 and DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine and penicillinstreptomycin. The SKBR3 cells are plated at 20,000 cells in a 35 mm cell culture dish (2 mls/35 mm dish). 2.5 \u03bcg/ml of the anti-ErbB2 antibody is added per dish. After six days, the number of cells, com"
