    ">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe type I receptor tyrosine kinase family is comprised of four closely related receptors: ErbB1 (EFGR or HER1), ErbB2 (HER2), ErbB3 (HER) and ErbB4 (HER4). These receptors are transmembrane glycoproteins which contain an extracellular domain for ligand binding and, with the exception of HER3, an intracellular catalytically active tyrosine kinase domain. These receptors transmit extracellular signals through the cytosol via a signal transduction cascade to the nucleus. The extracellular signal is transmitted by ligand binding to the dimeric receptor, with the exception of erbB2, of which a high affinity soluble ligand has yet to be identified. After ligand binding, the type I receptor tyrosine kinases either homodimerize or heterodimerize with another member of the subfamily of receptors (Lemmon M A, Experiment. Cell Res. (2009), 315:638-648). ErbB2 participates in this process by heterodimerization and is the preferred heterodimerization partner (Brennan P J, et al., Oncogene (2000), 19:6093). Dimerization leads to activation of the ErbB receptors by autophosphorylation of the intracellular domain. This autophosphorylation recruits adaptor proteins and leads to a phosphorylation cascade that transmits the signal throughout the cell. The type I receptor tyrosine kinase family (ErbB family) signals through the ras/raf/MEK/MAPK pathway as well as the PI3K/Akt pathway. These signaling pathways lead to both cell proliferation and cell survival through inhibition of apoptosis.</p>ErbB family receptors play important roles in cancer (Burgess A W, Growth Factors (2008), 26:263-74). Squamous carcinomas of the head and neck, and lung express high levels of EGFR. Also, constitutively active EGFR has been found in gliomas, breast cancer and lung cancer (Salomon, et al., Critical Rev. Oncol. Hematol. (1995), 19:183-232; Klapper, et al., Adv. Cancer Res. (2000), 77:25-79, and Hynes and Stern, Biochimica Biophysica Acta (1994), 1198:165-184). ErbB2 overexpression occurs in approximately 30% of all breast cancer (Milanezi, et al., Expert Rev. Mo. Diagnosis. (2008), 8(4), 417-34). ErbB2 is also implicated in other human cancers including colon, ovary, bladder, stomach, esophagus, lung, uterus and prostate. ErbB2 overexpression correlates with poor prognosis in human cancer, including metastasis, and early relapses (Baselga J and Swain S M, Nature Rev. Cancer (2009), 9:463-75).</p>The type I tyrosine kinase receptor family has been an active area of anti-cancer research (O'Donovan and Crown, Anticancer Res. (2007) 27(3A): 1285-94). Several inhibitors of the EGFR and the ErbB2 signaling pathway have demonstrated clinical efficacy in cancer treatment. Herceptin, a humanized version of anti-ErbB2 monoclonal antibody, and panitumumab and cetuximab, two anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies were approved for use in breast, colorectal, and head and neck cancers in the United States recently. Gefitinib (Iressa\u00ae) and erlotinib (Tarceva\u00ae) are small m",
    "erived from HI975 cells were randomly assigned into several groups (10 mice/group), Group 1 served as vehicle; Groups 2 to 5 were administrated with afatinib at 20 mg/kg (p.o. q.d.), Compound KU113 at 10 mg/kg (po, qd); Compound KU113 at 20 mg/kg (po, qd) and erlotinib at 100 mg/kg (free base, p.o. q.d.); respectively. The animals were sacrificed after 4 weeks.</p>The mice were monitored twice daily for appearance and behavior, and for signs of morbidity and/or mortality. The tumor volume was measured twice a week, and the body weight was measured immediately before measuring the tumor volume throughout the whole study.</p>At end of the experiment (compound administration for four weeks), all the tumor-bearing mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation under deep anesthesia. The tumor mass was resected, and weighed.</p>Tumor sizes were measured twice weekly in two dimensions using a caliper, and the volume was expressed in mm<sup>3 </sup>using the formula: V=\u00bd\u00d7a\u00d7b<sup>2 </sup>where a and b are the long and short diameters of the tumor, respectively. The tumor mass was weighed at the end of the experiment after harvested.</p>V=\u00bd\u00d7a\u00d7b<sup>2</sup>(a, b is maximum and minimum diameters respectively).\n</p>RTV(Relative Tumor Volume)=Vt/Vo Vo is the tumor volume when the test article is initial administratedVt is the tumor volume of every measurement day after test article administration</p>T/C(%)=TRTV/CRTV\u00d7100%\nTRTV: RTV of test article-treatment group; CRTV: RTV of control group Inhibition rate (%)=(average tumor volume of control group\u2212average cancer volume of test article treatment group)/average tumor volume of control group\u00d7100%\n</p>Significant effective: T/C %&lt;40%, P&lt;0.05</p>Non-significant effective: T/C %&gt;40%.</p>As shown in FIG. 2, Compound KU113 in this model is significantly more effective than erlotinib; and comparable with afatinib.</p>Example 15Intracranial Brain Tumor Xenograft StudyTumor Cell Preparation.Cells for human brain tumor xenografts are sourced either from tumors propagated as subcutaneous growths in athymic mice, or from cell culture. To prepare cells from subcutaneous tumors for transfer to the intracranial compartment, excised flank tumors are placed in culture dishes, where the tissue is initially minced with a scalpel and then mechanically disrupted by repetitive pipetting to create a cell aggregate suspension. The cell aggregate suspension is then passed through a 70 \u03bcM nylon mesh filter to produce a single cell suspension. The cell suspension is centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0 C., and the supernatant aspirated before resuspending the cell pellet in an appropriate volume of serum-free media to obtain a final working concentration. For preparing established cell lines for intracranial implantation, cells are harvested by trypsinizing monolayers, or by collecting neurosphere suspension cultures, then centrifuging and resuspending the cells as indicated above. The number of cells injected is variable "
