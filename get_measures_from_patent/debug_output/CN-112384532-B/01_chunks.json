    " indicated. In some embodiments, the term encompasses both wild-type sequences and naturally-occurring variant sequences, such as splice variants or allelic variants. In some embodiments, the term encompasses \"full length,\" unprocessed sirp\u03b21, as well as any form of sirp\u03b21 derived from processing in a cell. In some embodiments, sirp\u03b21 is human sirp\u03b21. In some embodiments, the amino acid sequence of one exemplary sirp\u03b21 isoform 1 is Uniprot accession No. O00241, month 28 of 2018. In some embodiments, an exemplary amino acid sequence of human SIRP beta 1 is SEQ ID NO 1. In some embodiments, the amino acid sequence of one exemplary sirp\u03b21 isoform 3 is Uniprot accession No. Q5TFQ8 at 1 month 31 of 2018. In some embodiments, an exemplary amino acid sequence of human SIRP beta 1 isoform 3 is SEQ ID NO 384. As used herein, \"sirp\u03b21\" refers to sirp\u03b21 isoform 1 unless specifically indicated otherwise.</p>The terms \"anti-sirp\u03b21 antibody\", \"antibody that binds to sirp\u03b21\", and \"antibody that specifically binds to sirp\u03b21\" refer to an antibody that is capable of binding sirp\u03b21 with sufficient affinity such that the antibody is useful as a diagnostic and/or therapeutic agent in targeting sirp\u03b21. In one embodiment, the anti-sirp\u03b21 antibody pair is independent, and the extent of binding of the non-sirp\u03b21 polypeptide is less than about 10% of the binding of the antibody to sirp\u03b21, as measured, for example, by a Radioimmunoassay (RIA). In certain embodiments, an antibody that binds sirp\u03b21 has a dissociation constant (KD) of &lt;1 \u03bc\u039c, &lt;100nM, &lt;10nM, &lt;1nM, &lt;0.1nM, &lt;0.01nM, or &lt;0.001nM (e.g., 10 <sup>-8</sup> M or less, e.g., 10 <sup>-8</sup> M to 10 <sup>-13</sup> M, e.g., 10 <sup>-9</sup> M to 10 <sup>-13</sup> M). In certain embodiments, an anti-sirp\u03b21 antibody binds a sirp\u03b21 epitope that is conserved in sirp\u03b21 polypeptides from different species.</p>With respect to binding of an antibody to a target molecule, the term \"specifically binds\" or \"specifically binds\" to a particular polypeptide or an epitope on a particular polypeptide target means that different binding can be measured for non-specific interactions. Specific binding can be measured, for example, by determining binding of the molecule as compared to binding to a control molecule. For example, specific binding can be determined by competition with a control molecule similar to the target, e.g., excess unlabeled target. In this case, specific binding is indicated if the binding of the labeled target to the probe is competitively inhibited by an excess of unlabeled target.   The term \"specifically binds\" or \"is specific for\" a particular polypeptide or an epitope on a particular polypeptide target, as used herein, may be exhibited, for example, by a molecule against the target having a KD in the range of about 10 <sup>-4</sup> M or less, 10 <sup>-5</sup> M or less, 10 <sup>-6</sup> M or less, 10 <sup>-7</sup> M or less, 10 <sup>-8</sup> M or less, 10 <sup>-9</sup> M or less, 10 <sup>-10</sup> M or less, 10 <sup>-11</sup> M or less, 10 <sup>-12</sup> M or less, any one of KD 10 <sup>-4</sup> M to 10 <sup>-6</sup> M or 10 <sup>-6</sup> M to 10 <sup>-10</sup> M or 10 <sup>-7</sup> M to 10 <sup>-9</sup> M.   As the skilled person will appreciate, affinity and KD values are inversely related. High affinity for antigen is measured by low KD values. In one embodiment, the term \"specifically binds\" refers to a binding in which a molecule binds a particular polypeptide or epitope on a particular polypeptide without substantially binding to any other polypeptide or polypeptide epitope.</p>The term \"immunoglobulin\" (Ig) is used interchangeably herein with \"antibody\". The term \"antibody\" is used herein in the broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies) (including those formed from at least two intact antibodies), and antibody fragments so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity.</p>\"Natural antibodies\" are typically heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150,000 daltons, consisting of two identical light (\"L\") chains and two identical heavy (\"H\") chains. Each light chain is linked to the heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the number of disulfide linkages varies between heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide linkages. Each heavy chain has a variable domain (V <sub>H</sub>) at one end followed by some constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain (V <sub>L</sub>) at one end and a constant domain at its other end, the constant domain of the light chain being aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain and the light chain variable domain being aligned with the variable domain of the heav",

The second round of FACS is a conjugate that is negatively sorted to reduce binding agents, a multispecific conjugate, and a conjugate of a human sirpa His-tagged monomer to a control protein. The last two rounds utilized human sirp\u03b21 monomer titration (100 nM,10nM, and 1 nM) to select the highest affinity binders, 100nM human sirp\u03b1 monomer, and competition with control AM4-5 antibody that binds sirp\u03b21IgV domain to assess competitor representatives in the enriched population (see U.S. patent application publication No. US 2014/024995).

For affinity binding measurements, igG-loaded sensors were exposed to 100nM antigen (human sirpa domain 1 (D1) Fc fusion or sirpa domain 1 (D1) Fc fusion) for 3 minutes, then transferred to assay buffer for 3 minutes for dissociation rate measurement. Additional affinity binding was determined by loading biotinylated sirp\u03b21 monomer onto the SA sensor and exposing 100nM IgG in solution. Monovalent binding measurements were obtained by loading human sirpa-or sirp\u03b21-Fc fusion antigen onto an AHQ sensor followed by exposure to 100nM anti-sirp\u03b21 antibody Fab.

Eight anti-sirp\u03b21 antibodies (four parent antibodies and four corresponding affinity matured antibodies) were selected for analysis. EC50 values calculated from these binding curves demonstrate that all eight anti-sirp\u03b21 antibodies recognize human sirp\u03b21 isoform 1 with high affinity. For example, the EC50 values for SB-1 and SB-1-2 are 0.034nM and 0.045nM, respectively. The EC50 values for SB-2 and SB-2-7 were 0.032nM and 0.029nM, respectively. The EC50 values for SB-8 and SB-8-13 were 0.022nM and 0.019nM, respectively. The EC50 values for SB-40 and SB-40-21 were 0.040nM and 0.025nM, respectively. However, the tested anti-sirp\u03b21 antibodies did not cross-react with human sirp\u03b21 isoform 3 or cynomolgus sirp\u03b21.

Receptor-bound antibodies were detected by staining cells with PE-anti-human IgG secondary antibody (Southern Biotech). A non-linear regression analysis was used to fit the curve with GRAPHPAD PRISM software. As shown in fig. 15A, the anti-sirp\u03b21 antibodies bound BWZ-huSIRP \u03b21 cells with a unique EC <sub>50</sub> profile. Anti-sirp\u03b21 antibody SB1-3 showed the best apparent affinity relative to other anti-sirp\u03b21 antibodies compared to positive control antibody 18D 5. The failure of anti-sirp\u03b21 antibodies to bind to cells expressing sirp\u03b1 (fig. 15B) or sirp\u03b3 (fig. 15C) demonstrated that these antibodies were antigen-specific.</p>TABLE 14 EC50 values for antibody binding to BWZ-human SIRP beta 1 cells</p>SB1-3SB2-8SB8-13SB8-15SB40-2018D5EC<sub>50</sub>(nM)0.028370.20250.19930.59628.7040.4769</p>Certain sequences</p>SB-1 light chain variable region</p>EIVMTQSPGTLSLSPGERATLSCRASQSVSSSYLAWYQQKPGQAPRLLIYGASSRATGIPDRFSGSGSGTDFTLTISRLEPEDFAVYYCQLLGSSPRTFGGGTKVEIK(SEQ ID NO:267)</p>SB-1 heavy chain variable region</p>EVQLLESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAASGFTFSSYAMSWVRQAPGKGLEWVSTISGSGGSTYYADSVKGRFTISRDNSKNTLYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCAKDFTEVVGWLGMDVWGQGTTVTVSS(SEQ ID NO:268)</p>SB-2 light chain variable region</p>EIVLTQSPGTLSLSPGERATLSCRASQSVSSSYLAWYQQKPGQAPRLLIYGASSRATGIPDRFSGSGSGTDFTLTISRLEPEDFAVYYCQQSSSHPFTFGGGTKVEIK(SEQ ID NO:269)</p>SB-2 heavy chain variable region</p>QVQLVESGGGVVQPGRSLRLSCAASGFTFSSYGMNWVRQAPGKGLEWVAVIWYDGSNKYYADSVKGRFTISRDNSKNTLYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCARDQTAAAAIWGMDVWGQGTTVTVSS(SEQ ID NO:270)</p>SB-3 light chain variable region</p>EIVMTQSPATLSLSPGERATLSCRASQSVSSYLAWYQQKPGQAPRLLIYDASNRATGIPARFSGSGSGTDFTLTISSLEPEDFAVYYCQQRLFHPPTFGGGTKVEIK(SEQ ID NO:271)</p>SB-3 heavy chain variable region</p>QVQLVQSGAEVKKPGASVKVSCKASGYTFTGYYMHWVRQAPGQGLEWMGWINPSSGGTNYAQKFQGRVTMTRDTSISTAYMELSRLRSDDTAVYYCAREGIAATDAYFDLWGRGTLVTVSS(SEQ ID NO:272)</p>SB-4 light chain variable region</p>EIVLTQSPGTLSLSPGERATLSCRASQSVSSSYLAWYQQKPGQAPRLLIYGASSRATGIPDRFSGSGSGTDFTLTISRLEPEDFAVYYCQQYADAPITFGGGTKVEIK(SEQ ID NO:273)</p>SB-4 heavy chain variable region</p>QVQLVQSGAEVKKPGASVKVSCKASGYTFTSYGISWVRQAPGQGLEWMGWISAYNGNTNYAQKLQGRVTMTTDTSTSTAYMELRSLRSDDTAVYYCARSGTHF"
