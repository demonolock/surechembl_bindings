    "eterminations of the Evaluated Compounds.The evaluation of the inhibitory effect of peptidomimetics were performed using an enzymatic method denoting the spectrophotometric displacement of the VEGF<sub>165 </sub>ligand from a bond with the specific receptor Neuropilin-1 by the evaluated compound. The studies were performed using polystyrene 96-well plates (Maxisorb, Nunc.).</p>VEGF165 Displacement AssayTo evaluate the biological inhibitory activity of selected molecules, the surfaces of flat bottom polystyrene wells of 96-wells plates (Maxisorb, Nunc,) was treated with 100 ul of 2 ug/ml anti-Fc IgG (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Quentin Fallavier, France) in phosphate buffer saline (PBS, Sigma) overnight at 4\u00b0 C. After washing and saturation of non-specific interactions with bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma), purified recombinant rat NRP1-Fc (20 ng/well, R&amp;D Systems, Abingdon, UK) in 50 \u03bcl PBS-BSA 0.1%-tween-80 0.005% (PBT), 50 \u03bcl of compound solution in PBT at final concentration of 100 \u03bcM and 50 \u03bcl of biotinylated VEGF165 (final concentration 1 nM, R&amp;D Systems) diluted in PBT containing 2 \u03bcg/ml of heparin (Sigma) were successively added to a final volume of 150 \u03bcl. After an overnight incubation at 4\u00b0 C., the wells were washed with PBT and treated with streptavidin-HRP polymer (Sigma) followed by washing and addition of ABTS substrate (Sigma). The DO measures were performed at 415 nm in reference to 470 nm after 15 minutes-2 h of reaction. To estimate the IC<sub>50 </sub>and Ki of the best hits, the compound concentration ranged from 0.01 to 300 \u03bcM. In the control wells, the tested compound was absent but the respective concentration of DMSO was maintained. The heptapeptide A7R (ATWLPPR) was routinely used as a positive control for each plate.</p>Results obtained for example peptidomimetics are shown in Table 2.</p>TABLE 2Inhibition results obtained for example peptidomimetics% inhibition of VEGF165 to NRP-1 bindingSequenceName30 \u03bcM10 \u03bcM3 \u03bcM1 \u03bcM0.3 \u03bcM0.1 \u03bcM0.03 \u03bcMAlaThrTrpLeuProProArgA7R85.576.961.2Lys(hArg)-Pro-Dab-Argcompound 210098.393.682.662.235.413.7Lys(hArg)-Dap-Pro-Argcompound 399.796.893.482.059.433.011.6Lys(hArg)-Dab-Pro-Argcompound 410098.591.482.447.821.6</p>EXAMPLE 4In Vitro Peptidomimetic Stability in SerumThe stability of two peptidomimetics: Lys(hArg)-Dap-Pro-Arg and Lys(hArg-Pro-Dab-Arg were tested in plasma samples obtained from healthy donors. Peptidomimetics stock solutions were prepared by dissolving the TFA salt of proper peptidomimetic in water to obtain a final peptidomimetic concentration of 0.7 \u03bcmol/mL. In a Eppendorf tube, samples of 100 \u03bcL of human plasma were temperature-equilibrated at 37\u00b0 C. for 15 minutes before adding 100 \u03bcL of peptidomimetic stock solution. Three tubes allowed the analysis for each time point. The initial time was recorded and at known time intervals (every 10 minutes from 0 sec to 3 h), 400 \u03bcL of solution of TCA in 99.8% ethanol (C<sub>TCA</sub>=0.2%) was added to the reaction solution for preci"
