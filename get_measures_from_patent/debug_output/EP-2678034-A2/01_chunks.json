The government has certain rights in the invention. </p>FIELD OF THE INVENTION </p> [0003] The present invention is related generally to the field of cancer therapy and more specifically to compositions and methods for use in anticancer and antiangiogenic therapies. </p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p> [0004] There is an ongoing need for compositions and methods that relate to prophylaxis and therapy of diseases that involve undesirable angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is in part related to expression of endoglin on endothelial cells. </p>Endoglin </p> [0005] Endoglin is a homodimeric tumor-associated cell membrane antigen with molecular size of 160 kilodaltons (kD) or 170 kD that is mainly expressed on leukemia cells and endothelial cells (Haruta and Seon, 1986, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83: 7898-7902; Gougos and Letarte, 1988, J. Immunol. 141: 1925-1933; Seon et al., 1997, Clin. Cancer Res. 3: 1031-1044). Endoglin's expression on endothelial cells is upregulated on proliferating endothelial cells of the tumor-associated vascular and lymphatic endothelium (Seon et al., Supra; Burrows et al., 1995, Clin. Cancer Res. 1: 1623-1634; Matsuno et al., 1999, Clin Cancer Res. 5: 371-382; Clasper et al., 2008, 68: 7293-7303). Endoglin is essential for angiogenesis/vascular development (Li et al., 1999, Science 284: 1534-1537; Arthur et al., 2000, Dev. Biol. 217: 42-53) and a co-receptor of TGF-\u03b2 (Cheifetz et al., 1992, J. Biol. </p>Chem. 267: 19027-19030). \n\n [0006] Murine endoglin has been characterized as a dimer with molecular size of approximately 180 kilodaltons (kD). Human endoglin exists in two forms; i.e., a smaller 160 kD form and a larger 170 kD form with the difference between the two being found in the cytoplasmic portion of the protein. Endoglin has an extracellular region, a hydrophobic transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail. A comparison of the nucleotide sequence of human endoglin with murine endoglin reveals an identity of about 71 to 72% (St. Jacques et al., 1994, Endocrinol. 134:2645-2657; Ge and Butcher , 1994, Gene 158:2645-2657). </p>However, in the human and murine sequences encoding the transmembrane regions and cytoplasmic regions of endoglin, there is a 93-95% identity. Thus, in the human and murine sequences encoding the extracellular region to which antibody would be directed at the cell surface, there is significantly less identity than 70%. Although the amino acid sequence similarity between human and mouse endoglins appears substantial, the observed amino acid sequence differences in the extracellular regions should be sufficient for generating distinct antigenic epitopes unique to human endoglin or to mouse endoglin. This is because in peptide epitopes, even a subtle variation in the amino acid sequence comprising the epitopes or in the flanking amino acid sequences can markedly influence the immunogenicity of the epitopes (see, e.g., Vijayakrishnan et al., 1997, J. Immunol. 159:1809-1819). For instance, single amino acid substitutions in a peptide can cause marked changes in the immunogenicity of the peptide (Vijayakrishnan et al., 1997, supra). Such changes in a peptide epitope strong",
    "human endoglin exons 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Representative exon sequences and amino acid sequences encoded by them are depicted in Figures 13A and 13B. In various embodiments, the mAbs are specific for the region of human endoglin encoded by human endoglin exon 4-8 and accordingly can bind with specificity to the portion of hENG which comprises or consists of hENG amino acids from N121-A378, inclusive. Exemplary antibodies with these characteristics are also depicted graphically in Figure 1. The invention does not include the mAbs designated SN6f and SN6j , which crossreact with murine endoglin. The hyrbidomas K42C10 and Y42F1 which produce SN6f and SN6j, respectively which were deposited with the American Type Culture Collection and were accorded deposit number HB-12172 and HB-12171, respectively. In one embodiment, the antibodies provided for use in antiangiogenic and antitumor treatment comprise SN6c, SN6d, SN6i, and combinations thereof. Hybrodomas producing each of the mAbs described herein are encompassed within the invention. </p> [0057] Characterizations of specific examples of antibodies of the invention are presented in Figures 8 and 9. In particular, in Figure 8, Panel A presents a steric epitope map of ENG that is defined by twelve SN6 series anti-ENG mAbs. This map was constructed by performing three different tests that include 1) a sequential competitive inhibition test using</p>125 </p>several <sup>liJ</sup>I-labeled SN6 series mAbs, 2) a simultaneous competitive binding assay, and 3) a comparison of the degree of susceptibility of individual epitopes to various enzymatic digestions. Panel B presents a linear sequence epitope map of ENG showing location of epitopes defined by eleven SN6 series mAbs (excluding SN6g). Amino-terminal and/or carboxy-terminal amino acid residue of each peptide fragment used for the epitope mapping are indicated in this figure. Amino acid residues in this figure are numbered excluding the leader sequence of 25 amino acids. Therefore, the amino-terminal amino acid is designated as El (Glu 1) instead of E26. </p> [0058] Figure 9 provides results from competitive antibody binding experiments </p> 125 </p>between SN6 series anti-endoglin mAbs and I-labeled SN6 as measured using cellular radioimmunoassay. One of the tests that was performed to compare the steric location of individual epitopes defined by individual SN6 series anti-endoglin mAbs was a competitive binding assay and the results of it are shown in Figure 9, where the abscissa for the left panel is ng of the purified mAbs (SN6, SN6a, SN6b, SN6j and SN6k), control mAb (SN4d; IgG2a- K) and control mouse IgG (MOPC 195variant; IgGl-\u03ba). The abscissa for the right panel is relative concentration derived from the reciprocals of 10-fold serial dilutions of ascites fluids of SN6 series hybridomas (SN6, SN6c, SN6d, SN6e, SN6f, SN6g, SN6h and SN6i) and \n\n MOPC 195 variant plasmacytoma. The target antigen was endoglin (CD105) on KM-3 leukemia cells. In this test, endoglin-expressing KM-3 (an immature B-lineage leukemia cell line) cells were first incubated with different concentrations of individual SN6 series mAbs </p> 125 </p>and control mouse IgG/or control mAb, and subsequently I-labeled SN6 mAb was allowed to react with the preincubated KM-3 cells. Preinculation of KM-3 cells with SN6 (autologous </p> 125 </p>mAb; a positive control) blocked the subsequent binding of -SN6 almost completely at the maximum while similar preincubation of KM-3 cells with SN6c or SN6d blocked the </p> 125 </p>subsequent binding of I-SN6 by approximately 90% at the maximum. On the other hand, preincubation of KM-3 cells with SN6i or SN6f blocked subsequent binding of <sup>125</sup>I-SN6 by 47% and 40%, respectively, at the maximum. Therefore, the epitopes defined by SN6c and SN6d are in different locations sterically from the epitope defined by SN6f (termed SN6f epitope). SN6i epitope is close to SN6f",
    " Examples and Figures presented herein, the presently provided anti-hENG mAbs have binding specificity for an epitope on the hENG part of the human/mouse chimeric ENG, and can be used to inhibit tumor- associated angiogenesis, and inhibit vasodilation of preexisting small blood vessels (vascular-targeting). Since it is believed the present results demonstrate that an anti-endoglin mAb, or an immunoconjugate containing the same, can effectively target tumor-associated vasculature in vivo, another embodiment of the present invention is a method of </p>antiangiogenic therapy which utilizes any anti-endoglin mAb recognizing endoglin expressed on human vasculature endothelial cells. More particularly, because the anti-ENG mAbs of the present invention exhibit immunoreactivity to ENG and therapeutic efficacy in targeting tumor-associated vasculature in vivo, such mAbs establish reasonably predictive utility in humans for themselves and for mAbs that recognize only ENG on the surface of human vascular endothelial cells. </p> [0072] The following examples are presented to illustrate the present invention. They are not intended to limiting in any manner. </p>EXAMPLE 1 </p> [0073] This Example Development provide a description of the development of</p>Knockin mice which stably expressing a novel human/mouse chimeric endoglin. </p>[0074] Twelve anti-hENG mAbs we developed define at least 8 different steric epitopes as determined by immunological and biochemical tests (e.g., competitive binding assay). The sequence epitopes, defined in a particular region in the amino acid sequence of hENG, of these mAbs were determined using recombinant polypeptide fragments corresponding to different parts of ENG molecule. Fig. 1 illustrates the sequence epitope. </p>[0075] We humanized the murine ENG (mENG) region covered by exons 4 - 8 because this region contains epitopes defined by the majority of the anti-hENG mAbs we have produced to date. In addition, the hENG protein region encoded by Exon 7 contains immunodominant epitopes. We constructed a gene targeting vector which was used for the targeted replacement of exons 4-8 of mENG with the corresponding exons of hENG (Fig. 2). The targeted knock-in gene was examined by PCR and Southern blot. Both results confirmed that exons 4-8 in mENG were successfully replaced with hENG exons 4-8 (Fig. 3). The Neo marker in the targeted gene in the knock-in mice was removed by mating the Neo-carrying male mice with Cre-deleter female mice. After repeated mating/breeding, we obtained the desired knock-in mice that carry the human/mouse chimeric ENG gene but free of Neo and \n\n Cre genes; this was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot experiments. Using a similar strategy, (Plan B), we replaced exons 5-6 of mENG gene with the corresponding exons 5-6 of hENG gene. </p> [0076] We then tested whether the translated human/mouse chimeric ENG protein is effectively expressed in angiogenic blood vessels. We addressed this question by </p>immunoh",
    "ample provides a description of production of anti-anti-hENG mAbs. Anti-hENG mAb SN6 was generated by immunizing a mouse with a tumor-associated antigen-enriched fraction of cell membrane glycoproteins from ENG-expressing human leukemia cells (Haruta and Seon, 1986, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83: 7898-7902). The remaining seven anti-hENG mAbs of the present invention were generated by immunization of mice with a purified human endoglin (hENG) preparation. hENG was purified from human acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. Cell membrane glycoproteins were isolated using detergent extraction and lectin affinity chromatography as described previously (Haruta and Sean, 1986, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 83:7898-7902, herein incorporated by reference). The isolated glycoproteins were applied to an immunoaffinity column containing anti- endoglin mAb SN6 (Seon et al., 1997, Clin. Cancer Res. 3:1031-1044. ) which had been \n\n equilibrated with 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 containing 0.5% taurocholate, 0.15 M NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.03% NaN3 and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The bound materials were eluted with 50 mM diethylamine-HCl, pH 11.3 containing 0.5% taurocholate, 2 mM EDTA, 0.03% NaN3 (\"alkaline buffer\"). The eluate was immediately neutralized by the addition of one-tenth volume of 0.5 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.1. The eluted material was reapplied to the immunoaffinity column and the bound material was eluted with the alkaline buffer further containing 0.01% cytochrome-c (a 12.4 kD carrier protein) and neutralized. The eluted material was dialyzed and concentrated using ultrafiltra- tion (e.g., with a YM-10 membrane). This purification process was carried out at 4-6\u00b0C. Purification of hENG was monitored by a solid phase radioimmunoassay using mAb SN6, and confirmed by gel electrophoresis with silver staining. The resultant hENG preparation contained a single, major component of 170 kD under unreduced conditions, and 92 kD under reduced conditions. </p> [0079] In a first immunization protocol, 2 female BALB/c mice were immunized with the isolated hENG following an immunization protocol described previously (Seon et al., 1983, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 80:845-849) with modifications. Briefly, an antigen solution comprising 10 \u03bcg of the hENG preparation in 100 \u03bc\u0390 of 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, with 0.5% taurocholate, 0.15 M NaCl, and 14 \u03bcg cytochrome-c, was mixed with an equal volume of adjuvant (e.g., Fruend's complete) and then injected subcutaneously at multiple sites on each of the mice. In addition, 1 x 10<sup>9</sup> Bordetella pertussis bacteria in 100 \u03bc\u0390 saline were injected at different sites. Two booster immunizations of the antigen solution in adjuvant were administered subcutaneously. A last immunization comprising 40\u03bc1 antigen solution containing 8\u03bcg hENG preparation mixed with 200\u03bc1 saline was administered intraperitoneally. The spleens were removed and fused with P3/NSl/l-Ag4-l (NS-1) mouse myeloma cell line 4 days after the last immunization. Cell fusion, hybridoma screening, and immunoglobulin class determination were performed as described previously (Haruta and Seon, 1986, supra). In a second immunization protocol, a female BALB/c mouse was immunized with the isolated hENG as described for the first experiment, but without the administration of B. pertussis. Eleven hybridomas generated by these immunizations produce individually different anti-hENG mAbs that were furthe",
    "-associated antigen-enriched fraction of cell membrane glycoproteins from human leukemia cells as described in Example 2. The specificity of immunoreactivity of each of these eight mAbs was characterized by testing them against various hematopoietic cell lines in a cellular radioimmunoassay (RIA) and by immunoprecipitation of hEDG using methods previously described (Haruta and Sean, 1986, supra). Briefly, 20\u03bc1 of a 1:9 dilution of the culture fluids of individual hybridomas and 2 x 10<sup>5</sup> hematopoietic cells in each test by RIA. Mouse plasmacytoma IgGl and IgG2a were included in the assays as controls. The results indicating immunoreactivity (+) or no detectable immunoreactivity (-) are shown in Table 1. </p>\n [0082] As shown by Table 1 for the anti-endoglin mAbs of the present invention, and as previously determined for anti- hENG mAb SN6, immunoreactivity was demonstrated for the immature B-lineage leukemia cell lines tested (KM-3, REH, NALM-1 , NALM-6 and NALM-16) and the myelo-monocytic leukemia cell lines tested (ML-2, HL-60 and U937). However, they did not react with any of the mature B-lineage leukemia-lymphoma cell lines (BALL-1 , BALM-2, BALM-3, Daudi, Ramos, U698M, and SU-DHL-4), any of the T leukemia cell lines (MOLT-4, JM, CCRF-CEM, CCRF-HSB2, Ichikawa, HPB-MLT and HUT-78), nor the EBV-transformed B cell lines (CCRF- SB, RPMI 1788 and RPMI 8057). The immunoprecipitation assay showed that all eight anti-hENG mAbs of the present invention precipitated a 170 kD component under unreduced conditions and a 92 kD component under reduced conditions. </p> [0083] The specificity of immunoreactivity of each of the eight mAbs SN6, SN6c,</p>SN6d, SN6f, SN6g, SN6h, SN6i and SN6j were further characterized by using these mAbs in histochemical staining of several human malignant tissues. The tissues included malignant tissues of breast, colon, kidney, lung, and lymph node. The tissues were frozen, then air-dried and fixed with acetone, and stained according to the methods standard in the art. The immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of the malignant tissue with each of the eight mAbs showed that these mAbs reacted strongly with the vascular endothelium associated with all of the malignant tissues tested, whereas the isotype control IgG failed to demonstrate any significant staining in each tissue. </p> [0084] In summary, the anti-hENG mAbs according to the present invention showed strong immunoreactivity to ENG as shown by selective reactivity to ENG-expressing human leukemia-lymphoma cells and human vascular endothelial cells as demonstrated by their reactivity with malignant tumor vasculature. Since ENG is primarily a proliferation- associated marker for endothelial cells undergoing active angiogenesis, the anti-hENG mAbs according to the present invention may be used to selectively target antiangiogenic therapy to tumor vasculature or the excessive vascularization present in other angiogenesis-associated diseases in humans. </p> [0085] It would be preferable for any potentially new agents ",
    "The results are shown in Fig. 7. When the survival of mice was followed, mice treated with the anti-hENG mAbs (SN6c, SN6d and SN6j) lived longer than those mice treated with control IgG. EXAMPLE 5 </p> [0092] This Example provides a description of antiangiogenic therapy using chimeric and humanized anti-hENG mAbs. The mAbs raised against hENG as described above can also be made as chimeric antibodies, or they can be partially or fully humanized. Suitable techniques for making chimeric and humanized antibodies are well known in the art. A \n\n description of making and using chimeric and humanized antibodies is provided in U.S. Patent No. 6,200,566, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Methods for antiangiogenic therapies using chimeric and humanized anti-hENG mAbs are similar to those for using murine antibodies. In general, chimeric mAbs and humanized mAbs minimize the development of human anti-mouse antibody responses. Additionally, the chimeric or humanized antibodies generally change the pharmacokinetics by providing a longer half-life of the antibodies, as compared to the half-life of the parental murine antibody in human. EXAMPLE 6 </p> [0093] This Example provides a description of epitope mapping for the antibodies described herein. To determine the steric epitopes of endoglin, we performed three different tests: 1) a sequential competitive inhibition test using several <sup>125</sup>I-labeled SN6 series mAbs, 2) a simultaneous competitive binding assay, and 3) a comparison of the degrees of susceptibility of individual epitopes to various enzymatic digestions. The results of these tests are summarized graphically in Figure 8. </p>[0094] While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to specific embodiments (some of which are preferred embodiments), it should be understood by those having skill in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as disclosed herein. \n</p>"
