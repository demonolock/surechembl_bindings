Regarding the fluorometric data, the binding saturation curve was created and the parameter estimation method was conducted using Prism software (GraphPad). Kd values were determined for each of test compounds.

Frozen tissues derived from the temporal cortex of an Alzheimer's disease patient was homogenized in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitor cocktail (cOmplete\u2122, EDTA-free; Roche), and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. pending analyses. To assay radioligand binding with homologous or heterologous blockade, these homogenates (100 \u03bcg tissue) were incubated with 5 nM [11C]PBB3 (molar radioactivity: 100-150 GBq/\u03bcmol) in the absence or presence of unlabeled PBB3 at varying concentrations ranging from 10<sup>\u221211</sup>-10<sup>\u22126 </sup>M in Tris-HCl buffer containing 10% ethanol, pH 7.4, for 30 min at room temperature. Non-specific binding of [11C]PBB3 was determined in the presence of 5\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M PBB3. Samples were run once only and specific radioligand binding was determined as pmol/g tissue. Inhibition constant (Ki) and percentage of displacement were determined by using non-linear regression to fit a concentration-binding plot to one-site and two-site binding models derived from the Cheng-Prusoff equation with GraphPad Prism version 6.0 (GraphPad Software), followed by F-test for model selection. In a one-site homologous blockade model, dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated from homologous competitive binding using this function:</p>Kd=Ki=IC\u206250-Radioligand</p>where IC50 and [Radioligand] stand for the concentration of the competitor inducing 50% inhibition and radioligand concentration, respectively. Experiments with [<sup>11</sup>C]PBB3 and unlabeled PBB3 were performed in a dimly lit condition to avoid photoconversion of the compounds.

For fluorescence labeling with PBB3 and test compounds, deparaffinized temporal cortex sections of an AD brain were incubated in 50% ethanol containing 0.001% (W/V) of PBB3 or test compound at room temperature for 30 min. The samples were rinsed with 50% ethanol for 5 min, dipped into distilled water twice for 3 min, and mounted in non-fluorescent mounting media (VECTASHIELD; Vector Laboratories). Fluorescence images were captured using a DM4000 microscope (Leica) equipped with a custom filter cube for PBB3 (excitation band-pass at 391-437 nm and suppression low-pass with 458 nm cutoff). In the fluorescence binding assessment, the reactivity of compounds with tau aggregates was semiquantitatively evaluated as \u20180\u2019 (no labeling), \u20181\u2019 (faint labeling), \u20182\u2019 (weaker than PBB3), and \u20183\u2019 (equivalent to or greater than PBB3). \u20180.5\u2019 score describes a middle-grounded condition of two integer scores 0 and 1. \u20181.5\u2019 score describes a middle-grounded condition of t"
