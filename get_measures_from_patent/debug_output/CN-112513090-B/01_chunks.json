After each cycle of dissociation is completed, the biochip is washed and regenerated with a regeneration solution prepared in a human anti-capture kit. The amino coupling kit used in the experiment was purchased from GE corporation (Cat. # BR-1000-50, GE), and the buffer was HBS-EP +10 Xbuffer solution (Cat. # BR-1006-69, GE) diluted to 1X (pH 7.4) with D.I.Water.</p>The data obtained from the experiment were fitted with the Binding model (1: 1) using BiacoreX100 evaluation software2.0 GE software to obtain affinity values.</p>Example 6: antibody sequences and preparation</p>Two monoclonal hybridoma cell lines with the best in vitro activity were selected by the ELISA binding assay (ELISA binding of human IL-4R-his) and ELISA blocking assay (ELISA blocking of human IL-4/IL-4R) as described above in example 2, the assay for inhibiting the activation of HEK293-Blue IL-4 cells under IL-4 stimulation in example 3, and the assay for inhibiting the proliferation of TF-1 cells under IL-4 stimulation in example 4. The results of the activity measurements are shown in Table 2.</p>TABLE 2 selection of hybridoma cell lines with the best in vitro activity</p></p>The monoclonal hybridoma cell lines 25G7 and 7B10 with the best in vitro activity are selected, and the monoclonal antibody sequences in the monoclonal hybridoma cell lines are cloned. The cloning of sequences from hybridomas is as follows. Hybridoma cells were harvested in the logarithmic growth phase, RNA extracted (according to kit instructions) using Trizol (Invitrogen, 15596-018), reverse transcribed (PrimeScript) <sup>TM</sup> Reverse Transcriptase, takara, cat # 2680A). The cDNA obtained by reverse transcription was subjected to PCR amplification using mouse Ig-Primer Set (Novagen, TB326 Rev.B 0503), and then sequenced by a sequencer, and the sequence of the resulting antibody was analyzed.</p>The variable sequences of the mouse monoclonal antibody 25G7 in the heavy and light chains were as follows:</p>25G7 HCVR</p></p></p>25G7 LCVR</p></p>it contains CDR sequences as shown in Table 3.</p>TABLE 3 CDR sequences of monoclonal antibody 25G7</p>Name(s)\nSequence of\nNumbering\nHCDR1\nGFTFSDYGMH",

The results show that both hu25G7 and hu7B10 bind only to human IL-4R and not to rhesus IL-4R, indicating that both antibodies bind to epitopes that are not homologous to human and rhesus and specifically bind to human IL-4R. Both antibodies block IL-4/IL-4R binding and intracellular signaling pathways, resulting in IL-4 activation being neutralized and TF-1 cell proliferation being inhibited, with the blocking and inhibiting activity of hu25G7 still being significantly better than that of the reference antibody, piruzumab, but with a relatively lower affinity KD.</p>TABLE 8 in vitro Activity assay</p></p>Example 9: affinity maturation assay for humanized antibody hu25G7</p>In order to obtain an anti-human IL-4R antibody with better drug effect, affinity maturation is carried out on a 25G7 antibody by a yeast display platform technology, an affinity matured yeast library aiming at6 CDRs is designed and prepared on the basis of the hu25G7 antibody, degenerate primers are designed, and designed mutant amino acids are introduced into the hu25G7-scFv antibody library by a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and homologous recombination method, wherein the size of each library is 10 <sup>9</sup> On the other hand, the diversity of the constructed yeast library was verified by the second generation sequencing (GENEWIZ) method.</p>Labeling human IL-4R with biotin, screening high-affinity antibodies from hu25G7-scFv yeast libraries, performing two rounds of MACS screening (streptomycin magnetic beads, invitrogen) and two rounds of FACS screening (BD FACSAria FUSION), selecting yeast monoclonal antibodies, culturing and inducing expression, detecting the combination of the yeast monoclonal antibodies with the human IL-4R through FACS (BD FACSCCanto II), selecting yeast monoclonal antibodies with higher affinity than wild-type 25G7 antibodies, sequencing and verifying, performing comparison analysis on the sequenced clones, removing redundant sequences, converting non-redundant sequences into full-length human antibody molecules, and performing "
