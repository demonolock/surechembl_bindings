    "pitopes may then be subject to further detailed analysis and filtering using predefined structural and expression parameters, and sub-cellular location parameters. For example, it should be appreciated that neoepitope sequences are only retained provided they will meet a predefined expression threshold (e.g., at least 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, or higher expression as compared to normal) and are identified as having a membrane associated location (e.g., are located at the outside of a cell membrane of a cell). Further contemplated analyses will include structural calculations that delineate whether or not a neoepitope or a tumor associated antigen, or a self-lipid is likely to be solvent exposed, presents a structurally stable epitope, etc. Further details on identification of patient-specific neoantigens and/or cancer-specific, patient-specific neoantigens are described in detail in the international patent application No. PCT/US16/56550.</p>Moreover, it is especially contemplated that the tumor-related antigen is a high-affinity binder to at least one MHC Class I sub-type or at least one MHC Class II sub-type of an HLA-type of the patient, which may be determined in silico using a de Bruijn graph approach as, for example, described in WO 2017/035392, or using conventional methods (e.g., antibody-based) known in the art. The binding affinity of the human disease-related antigen is tested in silico to the determined HLA-type. The preferred binding affinity can be measured by lowest KD, for example, less than 500 nM, or less than 250 nM, or less than 150 nM, or less than 50 nM, for example, using NetMHC. Most typically, the HLA-type determination includes at least three MHC-I sub-types (e.g., HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, etc.) and at least three MHC-II sub-types (e.g., HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, HLA-DR, etc.), preferably with each subtype being determined to at least 4-digit depth. It should be appreciated that such approach will not only identify specific neoantigens that are genuine to the patient and tumor, but also those neoantigens that are most likely to be presented on a cell and as such most likely to elicit an immune response with therapeutic effect.</p>Of course, it should be appreciated that matching of the patient's HLA-type to the patient- and cancer-specific neoantigen can be done using systems other than NetMHC, and suitable systems include NetMHC II, NetMHCpan, IEDB Analysis Resource (URL immuneepitope.org), RankPep, PREDEP, SVMHC, Epipredict, HLABinding, and others (see e.g., J Immunol Methods 2011; 374:1-4). In calculating the highest affinity, it should be noted that the collection of neoantigen sequences in which the position of the altered amino acid is moved (supra) can be used. Alternatively, or additionally, modifications to the neoantigens may be implemented by adding N- and/or C-terminal modifications to further increase binding of the expressed neoantigen to the patient's HLA-type. Thus, neoantigens may be native as identified or further modified"
