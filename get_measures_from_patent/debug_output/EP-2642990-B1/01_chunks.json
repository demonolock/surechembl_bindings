Resuits2.1 VPA attenuates phosphoinositide signallingSince the acute effect of VPA on phosphoinositide signalling has not been characterised, the inventors firstly examined the time- and concentration-dependence of drug action in Dictyostelium (figure 1). A rapid reduction in phosphoinositide phosphorylation was seen following 0.5 mM VPA treatment, with a 49% reduction in both radio-labelled PIP and PIP<sub>2</sub> turnover during 6 min VPA treatment, increasing to 94% reduction in the turnover of each phosphoinositide compound following 60 min treatment (figure 1a). These values indicate a combination of phosphoinositide synthesis and degradation within the cell, thus reflect phosphoinositide turnover, although phosphatase activity is blocked using an inhibitor cocktail. The acute nature of this effect occurs with a similar speed to that of seizure control following intravenous VPA injection in a mouse seizure model (Honack &amp; Loscher, 1992). The attenuation of phosphoinositide signalling was also concentration dependent, with a 25% and 42% inhibition of PIP and PIP<sub>2</sub> turnover respectively at 0.25 mM VPA following 9 min treatment increasing to a 68% and 79% reduction at 0.5 mM VPA respectively (figure 1b) - these concentrations are found in the therapeutic use of VPA (0.4-0.7 mM in plasma) (DSM IV, 2000). Under these conditions, this inhibitory effect of VPA provides an EC50 of 154 \u00b5M, and is independent of uptake (since cells are permeabilized with saponin). The acute, strong inhibition of phosphoinositide signalling caused by VPA made this effect of potential therapeutic interest.</p>A rapid reduction in phosphoinositide phosphorylation was initially thought to occur through inhibition of an unidentified lipid kinase activity. Analysis of lipid kinases traditionally employs pharmacological inhibition with enzyme class-specific compounds, but these studies are complex due to the large number of phosphatidylinositol kinase enzymes and overlapping effects between inhibitors. Since previous studies have suggested a role for VPA in attenuating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signalling pathway (Xu et al., 2007), the inventors analysed the effect of ablating five different type 1 PI3K genes in a single cell line (Hoeller &amp; Kay, 2007) on phosphoinositide signalling (figure 2a). These cells showed a 28% and 44% reduction in the formation of PIP and PIP<sub>2</sub> production respectively compared to wild type cells, suggesting a major role of these enzymes in phosphoinositide signalling. To test for a PI3K-dependence of the VPA-catalysed phosphoinositide reduction, VPA (0.5 mM) was added to these cells. It was found that VPA reduced PIP and PIP<sub>2</sub> production by 48% and 70%, respectively compared to untreated cells following 9 min treatment (figure 2b), indicating that these five ablated enzymes are not the target of VPA in at",
    "ncy (Fig 4): VPA reduced spike amplitude (75.2\u00b19.2 % in the first hour; 61.1\u00b18.3% in the second hour; 55.1\u00b16.6% in the third hour) (figures 4e,f). In comparison, 4-methyloctanoic showed significantly better control, reducing the mean spike frequency to 39.3\u00b111.3 % in the first hour (significantly better than VPA p&lt;0.05); 18.1\u00b110.3% in the second hour (p&lt;0.05 compared to VPA) and 26.9\u00b112.3% in the third hour (figures 4e,f). 4-methyloctanoic terminated status epilepticus (defined as a spike frequency of less than 1 Hz) in all status epilepticus animals. Furthermore, 4-methyloctanoic acid completely stopped the seizures in all 7 animals after 2 hours, whilst VPA decreased seizure severity but did not terminate the seizures in any (P = 0.0003, Fisher's exact test), and this effect was maintained in five out of seven animals given 4-methyloctanoic acid by three hours (P = 0.01, Fisher's exact test).</p>2.5 VPA regulates fatty acid uptake and releaseTo analyse a role for VPA-mediated regulation of arachidonic acid release in Dictyostelium, the inventors developed an assay based upon the release of radiolabel from cells containing tritiated fatty acid over time. Using this assay, the inventors showed that following <sup>3</sup>H-AA labelling of cells, the release of radiolabel into media was linear over a 45 min period (figure 5A). The effect of VPA on radiolabel release from AA-labelled cells was acute and dose dependent, whereby VPA induced a decrease in the release with an IC50 of 89\u00b5M. This effect was not specific to AA, since release of tritiated palmitic acid was also inhibited in the presence of VPA with an IC50 of 163\u00b5M (figure 5C). The acute nature of this effect is seen with a significant inhibition following 30 min exposure (p&lt;0.05).</p>Since reduced release of labelled fatty acid may be due to its re-incorporation into lipids, the inventors also measured fatty acid uptake by measuring radiolabel incorporation of fatty acids into cells. Like fatty acid release, incorporation of tritiated AA was linear over a 30 min period (figure 5B), however, VPA caused a dose-dependent increase in the uptake of AA, with an EC50 of 47\u00b5M. This effect was also seen using palmitic acid, with an EC50 value of 160\u00b5M (figure 5D) and was significant following 30 min drug treatment (p&lt;0.05).</p>In order to test if the above effects occur through simple fatty acid membrane insertion, the inventors visualised fatty acid uptake using a compound containing a 12 carbon fatty acid chain linked to fluorescent head group (bodipy; figure 6A) (Worsfold et al., 2004). Upon incubation of cells and bodipy-labelled lipid, 0.5mM VPA caused an increase in the intensity and diameter of fluorescent lipid droplets within cells compared to untreated cells (figure 6B). This results show that VPA also increased the uptake of this fatty acid, and that the drug increased fatty acid storage within lipid droplets.</p>2.6 VPA-induced fatty acid uptake occurs independently of actin dynamicsUptake (and release) of compounds in Dictyostelium is likely to be regulated by cellular mechanisms controlling macropinocytosis, thus changes in fatty acid incorporation may be due to simple regulation of this process. To examine this, and since macropinocytosis is dependent upon actin polymerisation, the inventors used latrunculin (10 \u00b5M), an inhibitor of actin polymerisation (de Oliveira and Mantovani, 1988), to observe the effects on fatty acid uptake. Inhibition of actin polymerisation decreased uptake in control cells. However, latrunculin failed to attenuate VPA-induced AA uptake suggesting VPA-induced fatty acid regulation was independent of vesicle dynamics (figure 6C).</p>2.7 Genetic ablation of PLA<"
