{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n1. The effect of VPA on radiolabel release from AA-labelled cells was acute and dose dependent, whereby VPA induced a decrease in the release with an IC50 of 89\u00b5M.\n2. This effect was not specific to AA, since release of tritiated palmitic acid was also inhibited in the presence of VPA with an IC50 of 163\u00b5M (figure 5C).\n3. VPA caused a dose-dependent increase in the uptake of AA, with an EC50 of 47\u00b5M.\n4. This effect was also seen using palmitic acid, with an EC50 value of 160\u00b5M (figure 5D)"}
