    "can College of Rheumatology criteria for RA and from 20 random healthy volunteers. Synovial tissues were obtained from 19 RA and 2 osteoarthritis patients at the time of joint arthroplasty or by closed-needle synovial biopsy. Five peripheral blood and synovial tissue samples were matched; the remainder were from different patient populations. These activities were approved by local institutional review boards, and all subjects gave written informed consent. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation. CD4 T cells were purified from unseparated peripheral blood by negative selection using a RosetteSep (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver) enrichment mixture. NKG2D\u2212 CD4 T cells were isolated from purified CD4 T cell populations with a FACSVantage cell sorter (BD Biosciences, San Diego) after immunofluorescence staining with anti-NKG2D mAb 1D11 [PDB] and phycoerythrin-goat anti-mouse Ig F(ab\u2032)2. For isolation of synovial cells, tissues were minced, partially digested with 0.3 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma), pressed through a metal screen, and centrifuged through Ficoll-Hypaque.</p>Flow Cytometry and Immunohistochemistry. PBMC, synovial mononuclear cells, and unseparated synoviocyte suspensions were examined by two- or three-color flow cytometry using various combinations of anti-CD3, -CD4, -CD8, -CD56, -TCR, -CD28, -CD45RA, or -CD45RO (BD PharMingen) conjugated to phycoerythrin, FITC, or PerCP. Binding of anti-NKG2D and anti-Ki-67 (BD PharMingen) mAbs was detected with phycoerythrin- or FITC-goat anti-mouse Ig F(ab\u2032)2. Biotinylated anti-MIC mAb 6D4 was detected with streptavidin-FITC. For intracellular staining, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% saponin for 10 min at 4\u00b0 C. before antibody exposure. For immunohistochemistry staining, 4-\u03bcm cryostat sections were made from synovial tissues embedded in OCT compound (Sakura Fine Technologies, Tokyo) and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Sections were fixed in acetone, air dried, rehydrated in TBS, and blocked sequentially with 0.03% hydrogen peroxide, 25% normal goat serum, and 25% pooled human serum, all in TBS. Sections were incubated with anti-MIC mAb 6D4, anti-NKG2D mAb 1D11 [PDB], or isotype-matched IgG for 1 h at room temperature in a humid chamber. Antibody binding was detected by using biotinylated secondary IgG and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (DAKO). Sections were counterstained with Harris' hematoxylin and mounted with Glycergel (DAKO).</p>Induction of NKG2D and Generation of T Cell Clones and Synovial Fibroblast Cell Lines. PBMC from healthy volunteers and purified CD4<sup>+</sup>NKG2D<sup>\u2212</sup> T cells from RA patients were cultured in RPMI medium 1640, 10% FCS, and antibiotics with or without IL-15 (15 ng/ml), tumor necrosis factor (TNF\u2212) (15 ng/ml), IL-10 (20 ng/ml), IL-12 (20 ng/ml), or IFN\u2212 (10 ng/ml) (R &amp; D Systems) for up to 10 days. T cells were tested for NKG2D expression before and at various time points after cytokin"
