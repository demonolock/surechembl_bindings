    "e of the complex of the FimC chaperone bound to FimH (which was bound to D-mannopyranoside) was determined to 2.8 \u212b resolution. The mannose binding site of FimH is a deep negatively charged pocket at the tip of its receptor-binding domain. The FimH pocket engages in extensive hydrogen bonding to mannose (FIG. 4), which are abundant in the oligosaccharide moieties of uroplakins that coat the lumenal surface of the bladder epithelium. A hydrophobic ridge surrounds the mannose binding pocket in a manner that may facilitate polar interactions within the FimH pocket. Mutational studies revealed that each residue is critical in mannose binding and pathogenesis, emphasizing why the pocket is invariant among UPEC isolates.</p>Development of Anti-Adhesives.</p>The FimH-mannose interaction was further investigated in an effort to develop potential ligand-based antagonists of UTIs. The chitobiose unit on oligomannose was found to bridge various mannose derivatives to the asparagine in the Asn-X-Ser/Thr motif of FimH resulting in higher affinity binding. Crystallization of FimH in complex with oligomannose-3 revealed the mechanism of this higher affinity binding. The non-reducing Man4 anchors into the mannose-binding pocket while the GlcNAc folds over Thr51 allowing specific interactions with a hydrophobic tyrosine gate. Heptyl mannoside mimics the GlcNAc tail of oligomannose-3 and extends it further to increase interactions outside the binding pocket resulting in high affinity binding (Kd=5 nM). Based on the high affinity of heptyl mannose for FimH, the ability of heptyl mannose to reduce bacterial infection in our mouse model of UTI was tested. First, biofilm formation as a surrogate for IBCs formed in the bladder was evaluated. Heptyl mannose at 1 mM inhibited UPEC biofilm formation in vitro, suggesting that the mannose binding properties of the FimH adhesin is required for biofilm formation. Thus, UPEC strain UTI89 was incubated with heptyl mannose prior to inoculation into the bladders of mice. This resulted in a significant attenuation of virulence at 6 hours post-infection at 5 mM heptyl mannose (FIG. 5). The ability of these compounds to significantly attenuate virulence establishes mannosides as a potential treatment for UTI. Therefore, more potent mannosides that mimic the natural receptor for FimH but with increased affinity and avidity in order to ultimately block bacterial colonization, invasion, IBC formation and disease were developed as described below.</p>Example 3Genetic Analysis of UPEC Baterial IsolatesDue to the necessity of FimH, it was tested to see if this gene was under positive selection. Through sequencing of more than 200 isolates, the majority of which were UTI isolates, it was discovered that residues on FimH are evolving under positive selection, none of which were in the mannose binding pocket. These residues are A48, A83 and V184 in UT189 (FIG. 6). Mutants were constructed containing the other naturally occurring amino acids ",

Subsequent deacylation with NaOMe in methanol gave the desired aryl mannosides 3-8 in good yield. Biological activity against FimH was evaluated using a guinea pig red blood cell-based hemagglutination (HA) assay (ref) in which the concentration of the mannoside on reducing agglutination by 50% was used as the primary endpoint (50% HA titer). This assay was preferred to a simple FimH binding assay for screening and developing SAR since it assesses the compound's ability to prevent bacterially-mediated adhesion directly in a cellular assay.</p><img id=\"EMI-C00044\" path=\"US08937167-20150120-C00044.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/290614132/US/20150120/B2/000008/93/71/67/US08937167-20150120-C00044.TIF\"/></p>As shown in Table 10, it was found that the general trend that 2- and 3-substitution was optimal for potency relative to 4-substitution in most examples with the exception of the acyl anilines 3q-s in which this trend was dramatically reversed. Ortho-substituted chlorophenyl 3g, cyanophenyl 3m, and meta-substituted methyl ester 3j all showed an impressive greater than 5-fold improvement in potency relative to parent phenyl mannoside 3a. Interestingly, carboxylic acid 3j lost 10-fold potency relative to matched pair methyl ester 3j showing a 50% HA titer of only 60 \u03bcM. Incorporation of an additional methyl ester in the 5-position of 3j, as with compound 4, resulted in a relatively large 3-fold enhancement in potency. Benzylic analogs 5a and 5b (pictured below) which have different conformational space and flexibility relative to direct phenyl substitution of the anomeric oxygen, as with to matched pairs 3a and 3b, show a 2-fold decrease (50% HA titer=60 \u03bcM) in potency.</p><img id=\"EMI-C00045\" path=\"US08937167-20150120-C00045.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/290614137/US/20150120/B2/000008/93/71/67/US08937167-20",
    "<sub>2</sub>Me0.1515b3,5-CONHMe0.3715c3,5-CO<sub>2</sub>H2</p>Perhaps the most unexpected finding from this study was that addition of another ester or amide substituted in the other meta position such as di-ester 15a and di-methyl amide 15b resulted in the two most potent mannoside inhibitors of FimH with activities of 150 nM and 370 nM, respectively. With respect to di-ester 15a this constitutes a 7-fold improvement in activity relative to mono ester 8e. The di-amide 15b, while slightly less potent, has much improved solubility relative to di-ester 15a. It was hypothesized that the addition of the second ester or amide serves a two-fold purpose for improving activity: First, the electron withdrawing group results in less electron density of the aryl ring thus improving \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions with Tyr48. Second, the mono-ester (or amide) analog can presumably access conformations in which the aryl ring is not in close proximity to Arg-98 whereas the meta di-ester (or di-amide) analog likely exists only in conformations where the ester or amide resides in close proximity to Arg-98 resulting in less entropic loss upon binding and a lower energy bound conformation resulting in increased binding affinity and potency.</p>In order to more accurately determine the relative contributions of both binding affinity to FimH versus other compound properties to the potency seen in the cellular HA titer assay, a high-throughput fluorescence polarization (FP) (or anisotropy) competitive binding assay was developed using a fluorescent-labeled mannoside ligand shown in Scheme 4. Synthesis was achieved as before using Lewis acid mediated glycosylation with protected aminoalcohol 17 followed by dual Fmoc and acyl deprotection of intermediate 18 to give free amine 19. Subsequent reaction of 5(6)FAM-OSu with 19 using triethylamine in DMF gave the desired fluorescently tagged FAM-mannoside 20.</p><img id=\"EMI-C00065\" path=\"US08937167-20150120-C00065.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/290613970/US/20150120/B2/000008/93/71/67/US08937167-20150120-C00065.TIF\"/></p>The K<sub>D </sub>for FAM mannoside 20 was measured to be 0.17 \u03bcM while the 50% HA titer was only 125 \u03bcM. Twenty mannoside ligands with structural diversity and activities were evaluated in the HA titer cell assay ranging from 150 nM to 125 \u03bcM for their ability to competitively inhibit binding of FAM 20. Interestingly, it was found that all potently competed for FimH binding having EC<sub>50</sub>'s less than 0.25 \u03bcM but having no clear correlation of EC<sub>50 </sub>with the activity found in the HA cell assay (Table 13). Although there was over a 60-fold range in cellular potency, there was only about a 5-fold range in binding affinity (FIG. 23). In addition, there was also no linear correlation of data with the two assays. Simple alkyl mannosides have the highest drop in cell activity as demonstrated with butylmannoside having the most dramatic difference with a 510-fold drop in cell a",
    "e synthesized and tested compounds are more potent inhibitors of HA titer and biofilm formation than anything commercially available and previously tested, some by as much as 2 logs.</p>i. Hemagglutination of guinea pig red blood cells by type1 piliated UPEC is dependent upon FimH mannose binding ability. Serial dilutions allow a quantitative analysis using this assay.</p>ii. Compounds that decrease hemagglutination by 75% were then tested in a type 1 dependent biofilm assay. First, the ability of mannoside derivatives to prevent UPEC type 1 dependent biofilm formation in the published Kolter assay was measured as optimized for the prototypic UTI89 strain used in these assays. Mannoside derivatives that allow growth but inhibit biofilm formation at 50% or greater were verified by repeating the biofilm assay and performing titration curves to determine the IC<sub>50</sub>. A more rigorous assay tested the ability of the strongest inhibitory mannoside derivatives to reverse hemagglutination of guinea pig red blood cells and to disrupt preformed type 1 dependent biofilms.</p>iii. A fluorescent polarization assay was developed and miniaturized to monitor the direct binding of a synthesized fluorescently labeled butyl mannose derivative to the FimH receptor as well as competitive displacement by other synthetic mannosides. This fluorescent polarization assay provides a rapid method for monitoring improvements to receptor affinity during the synthetic process, as well as providing Kd binding affinity measurements.</p>Example 8CrystallographyIn order to further rationally design better mannoside derivatives to inhibit FimH binding the most efficient inhibitors, such as ZFH253, with the FimH adhesin domain (FimH<sub>A</sub>) were crystallized to detail their interactions with FimH (FIG. 9).</p>The adhesin domain of FimH (residues 1-175 with a C-terminal 6-histidine tag, hereafter FimHA) was cloned into a pTRC99 plasmid and expressed in E. coli. FimH<sub>A </sub>was purified from bacterial periplasm by passage over cobalt affinity (Talon; Clontech) and Q Sepharose (GE Healthcare) columns. Protein was subsequently dialyzed against 10 mM MES at pH 6.5 and concentrated to 15 mg/ml for crystallization trials. FimH<sub>A </sub>crystallized in 20% ethanol, 100 mM imidazole pH 8.0, and 200 mM MgC12. Tetragonal bipyramidal crystals measuring 150\u00d7150 pm formed in two days and did not diffract unless slowly dehydrated over the course of at least 12 hours. The FimH<sub>A</sub>-ZFH253 complex was therefore formed by soaking individual crystals in a stabilizing solution initially containing 15% ethanol, 100 mM imidazole pH 8.0, 200 mM MgCl2, 10% PEG200, 5% glycerol and 1 mM ZFH253. Individual crystals were placed in 150 \u03bcl stabilizing solution and allowed to dehydrate to one-third their original volume over the course of 24 hours. Crystals were then harvested without further cryopretection and plunged into liquid nitrogen. Crystals diffracted to 2.55 \u212b at beamline 4.2",
    " continuity as demonstrated by holes in the biofilm, and it lacked the tall mushroom-like structures observed in untreated biofilm (FIGS. 19 d,e). Biofilm causes many antibiotic treatment failures since antibiotics are unable to penetrate its dense matrix. These results demonstrate that mannoside can prevent biofilm formation and dissolve preformed biofilms arguing that mannosides may augment antibiotic efficacy by altering bacterial community behavior.</p>To test the efficacy of the mannosides in vivo, UTI89 expressing type 1 pili were pre-incubated with mannosides, inoculated into mice and IBCs were quantitated at 6 hours post-infection (hpi). The efficacy of compounds ZFH-1177, ZFH-1253, ZFH-2050 and ZFH-2056 in inhibiting IBC formation correlated with their potency observed in the in vitro assays. The most significant reduction in IBCs occurred with as little as 10 \u03bcM ZFH-2050 or ZFH-2056 (FIG. 20a). These studies identified ZFH-2056 as the most potent compound tested in preventing colonization.</p>Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies with ZFH-2056 evaluated in vivo dosing conditions after intraperitoneal (IP) injection or oral (PO) gavage. ZFH-2056 was dosed IP and compound levels in the urine were evaluated at several timepoints by HPLC using mass spectrometry (MS) detection. Doses of 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg resulted in concentrations of nearly 5 mM in the urine 30 min after treatment (FIG. 20b). Eight hours after dosing, ZFH-2056 remained at levels equal to or slightly below the IC50 (0.74 \u03bcM) as determined by biofilm inhibition. Since oral dosing is the desired route of delivery, we next evaluated the concentration of drug after 100 mg/kg PO of ZFH-2056. The latter resulted in a 10 fold lower initial concentration of ZFH-2056 versus IP but, significantly, urine levels were 10-fold higher at 8 hours post-dosing. It is noteworthy that &gt;95% of drug cleared to the urine is intact with the remaining&lt;5% being the hydrolysis products, D-mannose and phenol.</p>The efficacy of in vivo mannoside treatment was evaluated after dosing animals with mannoside either IP or PO 30 min prior to infecting with UTI89. At 6 hpi the bladders were removed and total bacterial CFUs were quantitated. In both the IP and PO treated cohort, there was a significant drop in bacterial counts demonstrating the efficacy of mannoside in reducing overall colonization of the bladder (FIG. 20e). Furthermore, IBC quantification showed a significant reduction in IBCs in the mice that were pretreated with mannoside by either the IP or oral route (FIG. 20f). To test whether mannoside reduced IBC formation by blocking UPEC invasion into the bladder tissue, gentamicin treatment assays were performed. Gentamicin efficiently kills extracellular UPEC but is unable to penetrate tissue and thus intracellular bacteria survive gentamicin treatment 18. In the ZFH-2056-treated mice, gentamicin treatment of the bladders eliminated all CFUs (FIG. 20g). In bladders from untreated mice, 10<sup>3</sup",
