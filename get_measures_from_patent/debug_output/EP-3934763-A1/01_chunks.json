Tumor length (L) and width (W) were measured with a caliper, and tumor volume (V) was calculated using the following equation: V=LxW<sup>2</sup>/2. The data represent the mean \u00b1 SD (n=6). Statistical analysis was performed using T-test, * standing for p&lt;0.05, *** for p&lt;0.001, and **** for p&lt;0.0001. </p> [0046] Figure 7C shows images of tumors collected upon conclusion of the three-week treatment. </p> [0047] Figure 7D illustrates the average weight of tumors excised from each group of mice at the end of treatment. Statistical analysis was performed using T-test, * standing for p&lt;0.05, ** for p&lt;0.01, and **** for p&lt;0.0001. </p> [0048] Figure 7E shows the histopathological analysis using hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining. Representative tumors from each treatment group were fixed with formaldehyde, dehydrated and sliced into 5 pm -thick sections, and subjected to H&amp;E staining according to standard protocols (scale bar: 50 pm). </p>[0049] Figure 7F is the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay to stain fragmented DNA in apoptotic cells (scale bar: 50 pm). </p> [0050] Figure 7G shows immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of tumor tissues using commercially available antibodies against p53, p21 and Ki-67 (scale bar: 50 pm). Prepared tissue sections at 5 pm thickness were incubated with various antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight, and subsequently stained using the Labeled Streptavidin-Biotin (LSAB) staining method. Each stained section was evaluated by a minimum \n\n of 10 randomly selected x20 high-power fields for further statistical analysis. </p> [0051] Figure 7H is the statistical analysis of IHC scores. A numeric score ranging from 0 to 3 was used to evaluate immunostaining intensity (I): 0, no staining; 1, weak staining; 2, moderate staining; 3, strong staining. To evaluate immunostaining area (A), a numeric score ranging from 1 to 4 was used: 1, positive area&lt;10%; 2, 10%&lt;positive area&lt;50%; 3, 50%&lt;positive area&lt;90%; 4, positive area&gt;90%. The total score, IxA, was calculated accordingly, and statistical analysis was performed using T-test, * standing for p&lt;0.05. </p>[0052] Figure 8A illustrates the immunogenicity of PMI and <sup>PMI</sup>Bcr/Abl-R6 in immune-competent C57BL/6 mice (n=6/group) as measured by the level of IL-2 in the blood in response to subcutaneous treatments with PMI and <sup>PMI</sup>Bcr/Abl-R6 for three weeks, every other day, at a dose of 5 mg/Kg. PBS was used as a negative control for mock treatment; IL-2 in the blood collected at the end of the treatment were quantified by ELISA kits (R&amp;D Systems) using protein standards from Sigma- Aldrich. The data from each group are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD (n=6), and statistical analysi",
    "gnificantly inhibited it. Interestingly, <sup>PMI</sup>Bcr/Abl was marginally active, suggesting that this protein, even without R6, was probably still able to partially traverse the cell membrane at high concentrations, albeit at a greatly reduced efficiency (Figure 4C). It is important to point out that the molecular mass of <sup>PMI</sup>Bcr/Abl-R6 is 16-fold higher than that of Nutlin-3. The fact that <sup>PMI</sup>Bcr/Abl-R6 was even more effective than Nutlin-3 in inhibiting tumor growth suggests that <sup>PMI</sup>Bcr/Abl- R6, on the basis of molar concentration, is at least 16-fold more active as a monomer and 64-fold more active as a tetramer than Nutlin-3 in vivo. </p> [00107] Consistent with the above findings from the in vivo efficacy study, histopathological analysis using hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) (Figure 7E) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) (Figure 7F) staining techniques revealed massive necrotic and apoptotic tumor cells in the tissues from the <sup>PMI</sup>Bcr/Abl-R6-treated group and, to a lesser extent, in the tissues from the Nutlin-3 - treated group. H&amp;E and TUNEL staining also confirmed the partial activity of <sup>PMI</sup>Bcr/Abl and the lack of activity of PMI and Bcr/Abl-R6, as expected. Immunohistochemistry analysis demonstrated that <sup>PMI</sup>Bcr/Abl-R6 treatment significantly increased the expression of p53 and p21 in tumor tissues but decreased the expression of the tumor progression marker Ki-67 (Figure 7G-7H). Taken together, the in vivo data unequivocally validates the design of <sup>PMI</sup>Bcr/Abl-R6 as a potent antitumor agent that inhibits tumor growth in a p53-dependent fashion. </p><sup>PMI</sup>Bcr/Abl-R6 is minimally immunogenic and non-toxic to blood cells and kidney and liver tissues. \n\n [00108] Immunogenicity of peptide/protein therapeutics often impedes their clinical use. The immunogenicity of PMI and <sup>PMI</sup>Bcr/Abl-R6 in immune-competent C57BL/6 mice was evaluated by measuring the level of the cytokines IL-2, TNF-a and erythropoietin (EPO) in the blood in response to subcutaneous treatments with PMI and <sup>PMI</sup>Bcr/Abl-R6 for three weeks, every other day, at a dose of 5 mg/Kg. IL-2 and TNF-a were used as markers because T cell responses are known to play a critical role in the development of immunogenic responses to therapeutic peptides and proteins [52, 53] . Since biotherapeutics can potentially generate cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies that inhibit endogenous proteins such as EPO, leading to anemia known as antibody-mediated pure red-cell aplasia, EPO was also used as a marker for immunogenicity in the study. As shown in Figures 8A-8C, while free PMI noticeably increased IL-2 and TNF-a levels and decreased the level of EPO, only slight changes in the amount of IL-2, TNF-a and EPO were observed with <sup>PMI</sup>Bcr/Abl-R6, suggesting that grafting PMI to the Bcr/Abl protein scaffold significantly dampened immunogenicity o"
