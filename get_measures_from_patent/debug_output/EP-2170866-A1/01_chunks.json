    " 4-(2-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yloxy)ethyl)phenylboronic acid (136 mg, 0.545 mmol) and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (0) (31.5 mg, 0.0273 mmol) were dissolved in toluene (4 mL) and aqueous sodium carbonate (2.0M, 0.400 mL) under an atmosphere of argon. The reaction was heated at 100\u00b0C for 15 hours, cooled to rt, and taken up in ethyl acetate (80 mL). After washing with aqueous K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (10%), water, and saturated sodium chloride, the organics were dried (MgSO<sub>4</sub>) and evaporated to give a yellow oil. Chromatography over silica gel with a gradient of hexanes/0-100% ethyl acetate gave a pale yellow solid, compound 83. MS (M+H)<sup>+</sup> = 537.4. \n\n Example 52</p>Preparation of (R)-(4-(4-(4-(2-hydroxyethyl)phenyl)phthalazin-l-yl)-3- methylpiperazin-l-yl)(phenyl)methanone (84) \n\n ((R)-3-methyl-4-(4-(4-(2-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yloxy)ethyl)phenyl)phthalazin- 1 - yl)piperazin-l -yl)(phenyl)methanone (122 mg, 0.227 mmol) 83 and p-toluenesulfonic acid (130 mg, 0.682 mmol) were dissolved in methanol (4 mL) and stirred at rt for 1.5 hours. The reaction was added to 35 mL aqueous K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (10%) and extracted three times with 30 mL portions of dichloromethane. The combined organic extracts were dried over MgSO<sub>4</sub> and evaporated to give a pale yellow solid, compound 84. MS (M+H)<sup>+</sup> = 453.2.</p>Example 53</p>Smoothened Receptor Activity</p>Antagonist activity of compounds for mouse Smoothened was assessed by measuring inhibition of Luciferase activity in Shh-stimulated NIH-3T3 cells stably transfected with a luciferase reporter construct with 5 GLI binding sites upstream of a basal promoter, similar to methods described by others (Chen et al. (2002) PNAS 99 14071-14076; Taipale et al. (2000) Nature 406 1005-1009.) Antagonist activity of compounds on human Smoothened was assessed by measuring inhibition of GLIl transcription in Shh-stimulated HEPM cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA USA), similar to methods described by others. See US Pat. 6,613,798. For this work GLIl transcription in HEPM cells was measured using a Quantigene assay specific for GLIl (Panomics Inc., Freemont, CA, USA) in place of PCR based methods.</p>All exemplified compounds demonstrated antagonist activity of 1 \u03bcM or less.</p>Example 54 Smoothened Antagonist Activity in vivo</p>Depilation has been demonstrated to induce the Hh pathway in mouse skin, including increased transcription of the GIi 1 gene. Paladini et al. (2005) J Invest Dermatol 125:638-646. For this work, the mice were deplilated using wax strips (Sally Hansen, Del Laboratories, Inc, Uniondale, NY). Five days after depilation, mice were dosed orally with compound or vehicle. Six hours after compound administration, animals were euthanized and skin samples were collected. RNA was purified from the skin samples using a m/rVana miRNA Isolation kit \n\n (Ambion, Austin, TX). cDNA was prepared from the RNA, and GIi 1 expression levels were determined by real-time, quantitative PCR relative to the RGS reference gene. As illustrated in Table 6, compounds of the invention reduced GIi 1 expression compared to the vehicle, thus demonstrating inhibition of Smoothened signaling in vivo. Table 6</p>GUI Expression in Mouse Skins After Compound Dosing Compound Dose [GIi 1 /RGS ratio compound] /</p>(mg/kg) [GUI /RGS ratio vehicle] 5 100 0.41</p>23 50 0.33</p>Example 55 Antitumor Activity in vivo Anti-tumor activity of compound 23 was demonstrated using a mouse medulloblastoma allograft model (Sasai, K. et al. (2006) Cancer Research 66:4215-4222). Briefly, medulloblastomas from Ptch+/- p53-/- mice were subcutaneously implanted into immunocompromised mice, and subsequent passages of these tumor allografts were used for compound testing. For compound studies, animals bearing tumors with an average size of 200 mm<sup>3</sup> were treated with vehicle or 10 mg/kg compound 23 on a schedule of one dose per day for a total of 6 days. The treatment resulted in a &gt;99% reduction in tumor size relative to vehicle control after 6 days of treatment, see Figures 1 and 2.</p>Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in light of the teachings of this invention that certain changes and modifications may be made thereto without departing from the spirit or scope of the appended claims. \n</p>"
