    "ogenic, sugar- free sweetener, alone or in combination. For compositions which contain a sugar alcohol based excipient, additional sweeteners may not be desired, due to the naturally sweet taste of these polyhydric alcohols. It is desired that a sweetener or combination of sweeteners be obtained which is compatible with the pharmaceutical agent and the other components such that a good tasting solid dosage form is produced.</p>[0051] For some applications, it may be desirable to add a flavor enhancer to the composition to achieve a good tasting product. Flavor enhancers may provide a more pleasant sensation in the patient's mouth during oral transmucosal administration. Flavor enhancers within the scope of the present invention include materials such as ribotide (a nucleotide) and monosodium glutamate (\"msg\"). Other flavor enhancers are known to those of skill in the art.</p>[0052] Most drugs are present in solution in both the unionized and ionized forms. Generally lipid soluble or lipophilic drugs diffuse most readily across mucosal membranes. Accordingly, the compositions of the present invention may contain buffering agents, pH- adjusting agents, or ionizing agents to adjust the ratio of unionized lionized forms of the domperidone.</p>[0053] Whether a drug exists in the ionized or non-ionized (unionized) form is largely dependent upon its pKa, and correspondingly on the pH of the solution in which it is dispersed. pKa is defined as the negative logarithm (base 10) of the dissociation constant (Ka). pKa may also be defined as the pH at which a given acid or base is 50% ionized and 50% unionized. Using the well-known Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, concentrations of the charged and uncharged species of a drug can easily be calculated, if the pKa and pH are known. From that equation, it is clear that the ionized portion of the drug will be decreased by lowering the pH for weak acid drugs and increasing the pH for drugs that are weak bases. Domperidone has a pKa of 7.9. Thus, adding an ionizing agent that maintains a more acidic pH will increase the portion of domperidone that is present in the ionized form, which may lead to a decrease in the oral transmucosal absorption, and hence, bioavailability. Conversely, adding an agent (e.g., a base or \n\n buffer) that maintains a pH close to 7.9 will lead to in increase in the percentage of the drug that is present in the unionized form, and potentially increase bioavailability.</p>[0054] Domperidone diffusion across mucosal membranes may also be improved if the mucosal membrane is treated with a permeation enhancer. It has also been found that certain permeation enhancers can significantly enhance the permeability of lipophilic and nonlipophilic drugs. Other penetration enhancers are described in Cooper et al. (1987) \"Penetration Enhancers\", in Transdermal Delivery of Drugs, Vol. II, Kyodonieus et al., Eds., CRC Press, Boca Raton, FIa. Not all pharmaceutical agents fit this profile, however, and those w",
    " the art. In some embodiments, a therapeutically effective dose of the compounds described herein may provide therapeutic benefit without causing substantial toxicity to the subject.</p>[0075] Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the inventive domperidone formulations can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD<sub>50</sub> (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED<sub>50</sub> (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD<sub>50</sub>ZED<sub>50</sub>. Agents or compositions which exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in the subject. The dosage of such agents or compositions lies preferably within a range of circulating \n\n concentrations that include the ED<sub>50</sub> with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized.</p>[0076] For any domperidone composition used in the methods of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from in vitro assays such as cell culture assays. For example, a dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 as determined in cell culture (e.g., the concentration of the composition which achieves a half-maximal suppression of nausea or vomiting). Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in a specified subject such as a human. The treating physician can terminate, interrupt, or adjust administration due to toxicity, or to organ dysfunctions, and can adjust treatment as necessary if the clinical response is not adequate in order to improve the response.</p>[0077] In one aspect of the inventive methods, the compositions comprise a concentration of domperidone in a range of from about 0.01% to about 90% of the dry matter weight of the composition. In some embodiments, domperidone comprises up to about 75% of the dry matter weight of the composition. In some embodiments, domperidone comprises up to about 50% of the dry matter weight of the composition. In some embodiments, domperidone comprises up to about 40% of the dry matter weight of the composition. In some embodiments, domperidone comprises up to about 30% of the dry matter weight of the composition. In some embodiments, domperidone comprises up to about 25% of the dry matter weight of the composition. In some embodiments, domperidone comprises up to about 20% of the dry matter weight of the composition. In some embodiments domperidone comprises up to about 15% of the dry matter weight of the composition. In some embodiments, domperidone comprises up to about 10% of the dry matter weight of the "
