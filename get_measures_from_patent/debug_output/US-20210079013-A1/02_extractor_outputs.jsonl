{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nThe binding affinity of the compounds was determined by calculating the equilibrium inhibition constant (Ki) from the equation Ki=InPt/1+[radioligand]/Kd where Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant for the radioligand:receptor interaction and InPt is the inflection point of the dose-response curves.\nNon-specific binding was determined in the presence of 10 \u03bcM of the corresponding non-radioactive prostanoid.\nFor agonists, second messenger responses were expressed as a function of ligand concentration and both EC<sub>50 </sub>values and the maximum response as compared to a PGE2 standard were calculated.\nFor antagonists, the ability of a ligand to inhibit an agonist response was determined by carrying out dose-response curves in the presence of PGE2 agonist at a concentration corresponding to its EC70. IC<sub>50 </sub>values were calculated as the concentration of ligand required to inhibit 50% of the PGE2-induced activity."}
