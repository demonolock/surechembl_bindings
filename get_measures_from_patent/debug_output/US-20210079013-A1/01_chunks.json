    "wn under selection and individual colonies are isolated after 2-3 weeks of growth using the cloning ring method and subsequently expanded into clonal cell lines.</p>Example B. Prostanoid Receptor Binding AssaysTransfected HEK 293(ebna) cells were maintained in culture, harvested and membranes are prepared by differential centrifugation, following lysis of the cells in the presence of protease inhibitors, for use in receptor binding assays. Prostanoid receptor binding assays (for DP1, DP2 (CRTH2), EP1, EP2, EP3-III, EP4, FP, IP, and TP) were performed in 10 mM MES/KOH (pH 6.0) (EPs, FP and TP) or 10 mM HEPES/KOH (pH 7.4) (DPs and IP), containing 1 mM EDTA, 2.5-30 mM divalent cation and the appropriate radioligand. Test compounds of this invention were added in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to a concentration kept constant at 1% (v/v) in all incubations. The reaction is initiated by addition of membrane protein. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 10 \u03bcM of the corresponding non-radioactive prostanoid. Incubation was conducted for 60-90 mins at the room temperature or 30\u00b0 C. and terminated by rapid filtration. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting non-specific binding from total binding. The residual specific binding at each ligand concentration was calculated and expressed as a function of ligand concentration in order to construct sigmoidal concentration-response curves. The binding affinity of the compounds was determined by calculating the equilibrium inhibition constant (Ki) from the equation Ki=InPt/1+[radioligand]/Kd where Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant for the radioligand:receptor interaction and InPt is the inflection point of the dose-response curves.</p>Example C. Prostanoid Receptor Agonist and Antagonist AssaysWhole cell second messenger assays measuring stimulation of intracellular cAMP accumulation in HEK-293(ebna)-hEP4 cells were performed to determine whether receptor ligands are agonists or antagonists. Cells were harvested and re-suspended in HBSS containing 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. Incubations contain 0.5 mM IBMX (phosphodiesterase inhibitor, available from Biomol). Samples were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 10 mins, the reaction was terminated and cAMP levels were then measured. Ligands were added into dimethylsulfoxide for a concentration kept constant at 1% (v/v; agonists) or 2% (v/v; antagonists) in all incubations. For agonists, second messenger responses were expressed as a function of ligand concentration and both EC<sub>50 </sub>values and the maximum response as compared to a PGE2 standard were calculated. For antagonists, the ability of a ligand to inhibit an agonist response was determined by carrying out dose-response curves in the presence of PGE2 agonist at a concentration corresponding to its EC70. IC<sub>50 </sub>values were calculated as the concentration of ligand required to inhibit 50% of the PGE2-induced activity.</p>The data provide evidence that the tested heterocyclic amide EP4 antagonists of this invention had significant anti-tumor growth activity in immunocompetent animal c"
