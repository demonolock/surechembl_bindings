    "ease.</p>V<sub>max </sub>and K<sub>m </sub>of a compound for a transporter are defined in accordance with convention. V<sub>max </sub>is the number of molecules of compound transported per second at saturating concentration of the compound. K<sub>m </sub>is the concentration of the compound at which the compound is transported at half of V<sub>max</sub>. When the goal is to transport an agent, conjugate or conjugate moiety into the CNS, a high V<sub>max </sub>for an influx transporter such as MCT1 is generally desirable. Likewise for the same goal, a low value of K<sub>m </sub>is typically desirable for transport of a compound present at low blood concentrations. In some cases a high value of K<sub>m </sub>is acceptable for the transport of compounds present at high concentrations in the blood. For these reasons, the intrinsic capacity of a compound to be transported by a particular transporter is usually expressed as the ratio V<sub>max </sub>of the compound/V<sub>max </sub>of a reference compound known to be a substrate for the transporter. V<sub>max </sub>is affected both by the intrinsic turnover rate of a transporter (molecules/transporter protein) and transporter density in the plasma membrane, which depends on expression level. In certain instances, the goal is to avoid transport into the CNS. In these instances, low V<sub>max </sub>for all influx transporters and a high V<sub>max </sub>for all efflux transporters expressed in the blood brain barrier is desirable.</p>\u201cEC50\u201d, or \u201ceffective concentration 50\u201d, is a measurement of the substrate concentration that results in a turnover rate 50% of the maximal turnover rate for the substrate (0.5 V<sub>max</sub>).</p>A plasma membrane containing a monolayer of cells in physical contact with each other and having different sets of proteins embedded in the plasma membranes facing either side of the monolayer is described as being \u201cpolarized\u201d. For example, brain microvessel endothelial cells in the blood brain barrier have a luminal side facing capillaries and exposed to blood, and an abluminal side facing cells of the central nervous system and exposed to cerebrospinal fluid. The luminal plasma membrane contains a different set of transmembrane and membrane-associated components than the abluminal plasma membrane of the same cell. Brain microvessel endothelial cells in culture can also be polarized, where the cells form a monolayer in culture that has a luminal and abluminal side. MDCK cells, when grown on filter membranes in transwell dishes, form a polarized monolayer in which one side of the monolayer is the apical side and the other is the basolateral side.</p>\u201cSustained release\u201d refers to release of a therapeutic or prophylactic amount of a drug or an active metabolite thereof over a period of time that is longer than a conventional formulation of the drug. For oral formulations, the term \u201csustained release\u201d typically means release of the drug within the GI tract lumen over a period of from a",
    "T1 inhibitor phloretin to block the outward currents. To allow higher throughput application of compounds, the increase in the slope of the outward currents during the first 60 seconds of drug application were measured rather than the differential current induced by addition of the MCT1 substrate. An example of results from this assay is shown in FIG. 5. Data are expressed as a percentage of the response to saturating lactate responses (change in the slope).</p>Example 4Studies of Cloned MCT1 Transporters: Uptake into Mammalian CellsTo increase the throughput of MCT1 compound screening, a mammalian cell assay was developed. Because MCT1 mRNA is expressed at detectable levels in human cell lines, over 20 human cell lines were screened for MCT1 expression using quantitative PCR. Cell lines included A498, A549, ASPC, CALU, CAPAN, DLD, DU145, H69AR, HCT8, HEK-PEAK, HELA, HEPG2, HL60, JAR, JUR, KB, LOVO, MCF7, PANC1, PC3, and SW48. The HEK-PEAK cell line was found to have the highest levels of MCT1 mRNA and lacked expression of other transporters for monocarboxylates. HEK-PEAK cells exhibited high levels of <sup>14</sup>C-lactate transport that was not sodium dependent, was activated at low extracellular pH levels, and was inhibited by known MCT1 substrates with affinities similar to cloned human MCT1 protein. An example of lactate transport by LAT1 in HEK-PEAK cells is shown in FIGS. 4B and 4C.</p>To determine whether a compound interacts with the MCT1 transporter, a competition-binding assay was developed. This assay measures how different concentrations of a test compound block the uptake of a radiolabeled substrate such as lactate. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) for inhibition of transport of a substrate by a test compound is an indication of the affinity of the test compound for the MCT1 transporter. Competition binding studies were performed as follows. HEK-PEAK cells were plated in 96-well plates at 100,000 cells/well and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 24 hours. Radiolabeled <sup>14</sup>C-lactic acid (\u02dc50,000 cpm/well) was added to each well in the presence and absence of various concentrations of unlabeled lactic acid in duplicate or triplicate. Competition experiments were performed in an MES-based saline buffer adjusted to pH 6.8. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 2 minutes. Excess radiolabeled substrate was removed and cells were washed three times with a 96-well plate washer with cold assay buffer. Scintillation fluid was added to each well, the plates were sealed and counted in a 96-well plate-based scintillation counter. Data were graphed and analyzed using non-linear regression analysis with Prism Software (GraphPad, Inc., San Diego, Calif.). Competition binding in HEK-PEAK cells is illustrated in FIG. 4B.</p>Competition binding studies only demonstrate that a molecule interacts with the MCT1 protein, but do not demonstrate whether the molecule is a substrate and is translocated across the plasma membrane or is non-transported inhibitor or a non-transported ligand. In order to measure whether test compounds are actively translocated across the membrane, and to d"
