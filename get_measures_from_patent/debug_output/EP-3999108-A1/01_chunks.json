    " unbound ligand was performed by incubation of sensortips in buffer solution for 60 seconds. Binding to IgG was monitoried upon immersion into a 100 pg/ml IgG KB 5x solution for 300 seconds. Dissociation was monitoried for 400 seconds upon immersion in KB 5x buffer. </p>NanoDSF - Protein solution were loaded in glass capillaries and submitted to a linear heating process (20 to 95\u00b0C at 1 \u00b0C/min) inside a NanoDSF NT-Plex instrument (Nanotemper Technologies, Munich,</p>Germany). The fluorescence intensity at 330 nm was constantly recorded during the heating process. First derivative of the fluorescence intensity plotted against the temperature was used to determine the temperature of melting Tm. </p>Experimental results BUI (BiUayer Interferometry, Pall ForteBio) was used to record the IgG binding properties of 25 mutant proteins expressed at small scale in HEK cells, relative to the WT protein control. The proteins were immobilised on Ni-NTA functionalised sensor tips of the Octet Red BUI system. After washing out the unbound, the proteins were incubated in a human IgG solution for a determined period of time and the kinetics of binding was recorded. Subsequently, the sensor tips were removed from the IgG solution and plunged into a buffer to record the dissociation of the IgG from the gEgl constructs (see Table 14, Figure 31). \n\n Table 14 - Kinetics rate constants of binding of gEgl mutants to human IgG isotype control </p></p>k on: association rate; k off: dissociation rate; KD = k off /k on; Relative affinity = relative affinity (1/KD) compared to control construct HSV34; NP: not performed; ND: could not be analysed (k<sub>0ff</sub> values too low to compute KD) Constructs HSV41, 45, 49, 57, 61 were selected as they segregated in a region of the graph corresponding to slower binders and quicker releasers (see Figure 31) compared to the control. HSV44 was also selected due to its high k<sub>0ff</sub> value. The relative affinity of these six constructs ranges \n\n from 1% to 17 % of that of the control. These six constructs were expressed at higher scale and characterised to confirm their biophysical properties. BLI analysis suggested they all except HSV44 exhibited a significantly altered IgG binding behaviour (Figure 32). Then, the six constructs were analysed by dynamic scanning Fluorimetry (using intrinsic Trp fluorescence) (Table 15). The temperature of melting of the proteins was determined and compared to the WT control. The data suggested a slight decrease of the melting temperature of the mutants. Although this shifted Tm suggests a slightly less stable protein folding than that of WT, the shift was not prominent enough to indicate a major destabilisation of the protein folding. It is thus considered the six constructs have sufficient folding stability for further use in preclinical studies.

    "iences). Westem-Blot pattern of the band of interest (gl, since it is the protein containing the 6xHis-tag) corresponds to the pattern of a heterogenously glycosylated protein. The MW of gE and gl are 45.5 kDa and 27 kDa, respectively. The protein N-glycosylation prediction sites according to NetNGlyc 1.0 is of 2 sites for gE and 4 sites for gl. For O-glycosylation, according to predictions using NetOGlyc 4.0, there are 12 sites for gE and 20 sites for gl. </p>Purification of HSV2 gEgl mutants - see example 3 </p>BiLaver Interferometry by Octet - Ni-NTA sensors (Pall, #18-5101) were prewetted by incubation in kinetic buffer (Pall, #18-1105) lx for at least 30 minutes at RT before starting the measurement using an Octet Red 96e (Pall) instmment. All samples, standards and controls were diluted in kinetic buffer lx to a final volume of 200 pi in the wells of a Greiner black 96-w microplate (Greiner, #655076). All the measurements were performed at 30\u00b0C and the microplate containing the test samples were maintained under constant 1000 rpm shaking. Octet uses disposable tip-shaped biosensor and the Octet Red96e reads 8 tips in parallel. After the measurement, the sensors were replaced. </p>The workflow was the following: </p></p> The analysis software Data Analysis HT version 10.0.3.7 was used to review the experimental data and calculate the analyte content. Only the response (binding signal at the end of the association period) was used for ranking purposes. An affinity value (KD) was generated but was deemed unaccurate given the low signal intensity of the selected candidates. \n\n Nano-DSF - The Prometheus NT.Plex instrument (NanoTemper Technologies) was used to determine the melting profiles of the samples by using intrinsic fluorescence from tryptophan residues. Test capillaries were filled with 10 pi of sample and placed on the sample holder. A temperature gradient of 1 \u00b0C/min from 25 to 95\u00b0C was applied and the intrinsic protein fluorescence at 330 and 350 nm was recorded. Scattering light is also detected at 350 nm. After completion of the measurement, Tm (temperature of melting) and Ton (onset of melting transition) was automatically determined through the calculation of the first derivative of the experimental signal. In the present experiment, only the 330 nm signal was used for calculations it was observed that this read-out was best correlated with DSF. </p>DSF (Dynamic Scanning Fluoresence) - DSF is similar to nanoDSF, with the exception that the methodology uses the extrinsic dye Sypro Orange. Upon heating the protein sample, the dye, initially buried inside hydrophobic patch, become exposed to the solvant and becomes fluorescent. </p>Sypro Orange (5000x concentrated in DMSO, Thermo) was added to protein samples (final concentration 2x) and then the samples were submitted to temperature ramping (ambiant to 95 \u00b0C, 1\u00b0C per minute) in a LightCycler 480II (Roche) instrument. During heating, the fluorescence (Exc 498 nm, Em 630 nm) was const",
    "rol, and PEG-lipid conjugate) were dissolved in an ethanolic solution and SAM was in an aqueous buffered solution. The ethanolic and aqueous solutions were rapidly mixed together using a microfludic mixing chamber. The SAM- entrapped lipid nanoparticles form spontaneously through nucleation of supersaturated lipids in the mixture. Condensation and precipitation of the lipids entrapped SAM and formed lipid nanoparticles. Following a brief maturation of the LNP, the buffer of the SAM-LNP were then exchanged into a storage buffer. The SAM-LNP solutions were characterized for size, lipid content, RNA entrapment and in vitro potency. </p>Size and Polvdispersitv - Dynamic light scattering (DLS) was used to measure SAM LNP particle size and the distribution of size (polydispersity index). SAM LNP materials were diluted in LNP holding buffer and added to low volume cuvettes. Samples were measured using a Malvern Zetasizer light scattering instrument according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Particle sizes were reported as the Z-average with the polydispersity index (PD I). </p>In vitro Potency of SAM LNP Preparations - BHK cells were cultured to an appropriate density, treated with SAM LNP in culture media using a 3 -fold dilution to produce an 8 -point dose curve. Treatment of cells with LNP was allowed to proceed overnight (18h). The following day, cells were stained (rabbit anti-gE and/or anti-gl polyclonal sera generated in-house) and analyzed with a high- content imager and EC50 values were determined by non-linear regression to a dose-fitting curve. Potency was determined as the dose of SAM LNP needed to transfect 50% of cultured cells (EC50) in a well of a 96-well plate. </p>RNA Entrapment - The percentages of SAM encapsulated within LNP were determined by the Quant-iT Ribogreen RNA reagent kit. RiboGreen dye (low fluorescence) selectively interacts with RNA and upon which its fluorescence increases. Thus, RNA concentrations can be determined by correlating the fluorescence of sample treated with RiboGreen dye to fluorescence of standard RNA treated with RiboGreen (this was done according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions). RNA encapsulation was determined by comparing SAM concentration in the presence and absence of Triton X-100. Triton X-100 disrupts the LNP releasing the SAM. In the absence of Triton X-100, the dye interacts only with solvent accessible RNA; this could include: SAM outside of the LNP, LNP-surface bound SAM or SAM located in superficial layers of LNPs accessible to dye through membrane imperfections. RNA concentrations obtained from samples without Triton X were interpreted as\u201cnot \n\n encapsulated\u201d. RNA concentrations measured from Triton X-treated samples (i.e. when the LNPs are disrupted and total SAM released) represent the total RNA amount (outside and inside LNPs). </p>Results: the size of each LNP was determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) which provided an average hydrodynamic diameter that is based on the intensity of scattering, and a polydispersity index which is a measure of heterogeneity of LNP size. Each of the LNP preparations had a size around 120 nm with low PDI values indicating that the size distribution for each preparation was narrowly disperse. Each LNP preparation also had RNA entrapment greater than 80%. In vitro potency was determined. This assay determined gE and/or gl expression (table represents data as EC50 values for gl) in cell cultures. Potency of materials was reported as the dose required to transfect 50% of cells cultured in one well of a 96-well plate. All HSV SAM LNP candidates provided potent EC50 responses (Table 23). </p>Table 23.
