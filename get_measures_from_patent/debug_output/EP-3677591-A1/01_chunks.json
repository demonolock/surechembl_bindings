    "acid sequence of the variable heavy chain of X02.1. The closest human germline variable heavy chain gene was IGHV4-61<sup>\u2217</sup>01 (SEQ ID NO: 16). An alignment of the X02.1 VH and IGHV4-61<sup>\u2217</sup>01 is shown in Figure 2. The X02.1 variable heavy region differs by eight amino acids from its closest germline amino acid sequence. In order to reduce the immunogenicity of the X02.1 heavy chain variable region, germline amino acid residue substitutions could be produced at residues where it differs from the germline sequence and the resulting antibody variants tested for anti-CD38 binding activity.</p>Several heavy chain variants of the X02.1 parental sequence are detailed in Figure 2. These heavy chain variable regions were formatted onto the IgG4 S228P constant region, and co-expressed with the A02.1 light chain. Tables 1a and 1b detail the sequences of the variants tested along with their ability to bind human CD38 as assessed using flow cytometry and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Briefly, antibody chains were transiently co-expressed in CHO cells and purified via Protein A chromatography as described in Example 5. Flow binding assays as described in Example 5 were used to assess the variants. The EC<sub>50</sub> of the dose response curve obtained for each antibody is also given in Tables 1a and 1b.\nTable 1aAntibody DesignationVariable Heavy Chain Amino Acid Substitution (Relative to X02.1)Variable Heavy SEQ ID NO:Variable Light SEQ ID NO:CD38 binding by SPRARP-1 flow binding assay (EC<sub>50</sub> in \u00b5g/mL)X02.8L74S17142.30 x10<sup>-8</sup>18.3X02.9H40P18142.63 x10<sup>-8</sup>N/TX02.10T(82A)S19142.07 x10<sup>-8</sup>N/TX02.11L74S, I78F R81K, T(82A)S20142.39 x10<sup>-8</sup>18.1X02.108I78F32142.63 x10<sup>-8</sup>N/TX02.110R81K33142.07 x10<sup>-8</sup>N/TN/T - Protein was not able to be purified and was not tested.\nTable 1bAntibody DesignationVariable Heavy Chain Amino Acid Substitution (Relative to X02.1)Variable Heavy SEQ ID NO:Variable Light SEQ ID NO: [Verify]CD38 binding by SPRARP-1 flow binding assay (EC<sub>50</sub> in \u00b5g/mL)X02.69Q2V22143.68 x10<sup>-11</sup>16.8X02.71I29V24141.29 x10<sup>-10</sup>3.5X02.78S32G31142.04 x10<sup>-11</sup>N/TN/T - Protein not purified or tested.</p>SPR binding of the variants detailed in Table 1a was evaluated separately to those of Table 1b.

Flow cytometry binding experiments showed antibodies X02.8, X02.11, X02.69 and X02.71 bound strongly to the CD38 positive cell line ARP-1.</p>Antibodies with the above amino acid substitutions were subsequently explored in the context of a fusion protein through conjugation to attenuated IFN-alpha2b (termed A02 when linked to IFN, with the number following the decimal representing the same variant having the X02 designation). These heavy chain variable regions were formatted onto an IgG4 constant region comprising the substitution S228P fused to A145D attenuated IFN-alpha2b and co-expressed in CHO or HEK cells with the A02.1 light chain as described in Example 5. Proteins that were successfully purified from cell supernatant were then tested in a flow binding assay to the cell line ARP-1. The EC<sub>50</sub> value of the dose response curve for each antibody is given in Table 2. All antibody-attenuated IFN fusion constructs tested bound to the CD38 positive cell line ARP-1. It was observed that heavy chain variant X02.9 (not fused to IFN) could not easily be purified whereas an identical variant fused to IFN (A02.9) was purified. In some cases, attenuated IFN fusion proteins could be expressed and purified, when the equivalent monoclonal antibody appeared more difficult to be expressed and/or purify.\nTable 2Anti-CD38-attenuated IFN fusion proteinVariable Heavy Chain Amino Acid Substitution (Relative to A02.1)Variable Heavy SEQ ID NO:Variable Light SEQ ID NO:Protein A capture by SPR (RU)*CD38 binding by SPR (RU) at 350 sec*ARP-1 flow binding assay (EC<sub>50</sub> in \u00b5g/mL)A02.8L74S171446978331.9A02.9H40P181447188411.0A02.10T(82A)S191446478041.5A02.11L74S, I78F, R81K, T(82A)S201444838273.5*The amount of Anti-CD38 attenuated IFN fusion protein in the cell culture supernatant is indicated by the Protein A capture by SPR.

The closest human germline variable light chain gene was IGLV5-37<sup>\u2217</sup>01. An amino acid sequence alignment of A02.1VL and IGLV5-37<sup>\u2217</sup>01 is given in Figure 3. This alignment illustrates a 12 amino acid difference between these sequences.</p>Several amino acid substitutions were made in the X02.1 variable light chain. These substitutions are shown in Figure 3. Co-expression of these light chain variable regions with the X02.1 variable heavy chain formatted onto an IgG4 constant region containing the substitution S228P was performed in CHO cells as described in Example 5.</p>Antibodies purified from CHO cell supernatants were subsequently tested in flow cytometry-based binding assays to the CD38 positive cell line ARP-1.

These include a potential isomerization site at D101 and a potential oxidation site at M(100C). To remove the potential isomerization and oxidation sites, amino acid substitutions were made as follows: D(101)E (SEQ ID NO: 30), M(100C)L (SEQ ID NO: 29) and the combination of both D(101)E and M(100C)L (SEQ ID NO: 27) (Figure 2). Antibodies were made with combinations of these amino acid substitutions in the variable heavy chain as shown in Table 4. Antibody heavy chain variable regions were formatted with an IgG4 constant region containing the substitution S228P and co-expressed with the A02.1 light chain in CHO cells. Antibodies were then purified by Protein A chromatography and screened for binding to ARP-1 cells by flow cytometry. The binding data obtained is shown in Table 4.\nTable 4Antibody DesignationVariable Heavy Chain Amino Acid Substitution (Relative to X02.1)Variable Heavy SEQ ID NO:Variable Light SEQ ID NO:CD38 binding by SPR (KD)ARP-1 flow binding assay (EC<sub>50</sub> in \u00b5g/mL)Protein A HPLC mg/LX02.76M(100C)L29141.58 x 10<sup>-13</sup>4.124.8X02.77D101E30149.11 x 10<sup>-12</sup>3.715.6X02.74M(100C)L, D101E27146.85 x 10<sup>-11</sup>N/T21.8N/T - Protein was not purified or not tested.</p>Antibodies X02.76 and X02.77 maintained their strong binding to the ARP-1 cell line indicating that the amino acids substitutions to remove the potential oxidation and isomerization sites in the X02.1 and A02.1 heavy chain had little impact on their CD38 binding activity. Combining these substitutions to form antibody X02.74 resulted in an antibody that did not purify using the protocol in Example 5.</p>Amino acid analysis of the variable light chain sequence of X02.1 and A02.1 identified amino acids that could potentially undergo oxidation or deamidation. These included a potential deamidation site at N69 and potential oxidation site at M89. Additionally a putative N-linked glycosylation site was predicted to exist within CDR3 of the light chain at position N94. The presence of N-linked glycans can cause heterogeneity in therapeutic proteins, complicating development. To remove these potential issues the following point variants were synthesized: N69A (SEQ ID NO: 39), M89L (SEQ ID NO: 52) and M89I (SEQ ID NO: 51), N94T (SEQ ID NO: 48), N94Q (SEQ ID NO: 38), G95P (SEQ ID NO: 50) and S96A (SEQ ID NO: 45) (see Figure 3).

Other substitutions that remove this glycosylation motif either resulted in antibodies that could not easily be purified or antibodies that exhibited attenuated binding to the CD38 positive cell line ARP-1. The potential deamidation site at position 69 was removed through substitution to alanine , though this antibody (X02.81) was not easily purified.</p>Other antibodies tested that comprised X02.1 variable heavy chain variants are listed in Table 6.

It could be further envisioned that combinations of substitutions could be made such as those described for Anti-CD38 antibodies X02.114, X02.115, X02.116, X02.117, X02.118, X02.119 (Figure 6), X02.120, X02.121, X02.122, X02.123, X02.124, X02.125, X02.126 or X02.127 (Figure 30). Further the above Anti-CD38 antibodies could also be constructed as Anti-CD38-attenuated IFN fusion proteins and tested for functional activity as described herein.</p>H929 multiple myeloma xenograft modelThe in vivo potency of A02.1 has been tested previously in the NCI- H929 s.c. multiple myeloma model as described in Example 5. A02.1 was shown to have potent anti-tumor activity. The data is presented in PCT/AU2012/001323</patcit>.</p>The H929 multiple myeloma xenograft model could be used to test the anti-tumor activity of any of the Anti-CD38-attenuated IFN fusion proteins described above.</p>Attenuated IFN is required for potent apoptotic and caspase activation in tumor cell linesUsing the Annexin V assay and the Caspase Assay it was demonstrated that the potent apoptotic activity and caspase activation is dependent on the Anti-CD38-attenuated IFN fusion proteins containing an attenuated IFN (Table 16a, Figure 18).

    "uffer (0.01 M HEPES, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.005% v/v Surfactant P20, pH 7.4). At a flow rate of 20 \u00b5l/min, both flow cells were regenerated with 10\u00b5L 50mM sodium hydroxide before 40 \u00b5L supernatant containing the protein was passed over FC1 (or FC3) only. 30\u00b5L of CD38 (10 \u00b5g/mL in running buffer) or 30 \u00b5L running buffer was injected over FC1 and FC2 with a 5 minute dissociation time. Both surfaces were regenerated twice with sodium hydroxide. Results were generated using the BIAevaluation software provided with the machine. Microsoft Excel was used for calculations. BIAevaluation software automatically subtracted the reference sensorgram giving a trace of FC2-1 (or FC4-3) for each sample. A double reference was performed for each antibody tested by subtracting the sensorgram with a CD38 injection from the sensorgram with a blank running buffer injection. The Protein A capture refers to the response units measured from a sensorgram at a fixed timepoint of 412.5s and this corresponds to the level of protein captured on the Protein A surface. CD38 binding is the response units measured at 507.5s and is an indication of the level of bound CD38 to the protein captured sensor. CD38 dissociation is the response units measured at 865.5s and is an indication of the level of CD38 bound to the protein captured surface after approximately 300s of dissociation phase. BIAevalution was used to fit the sensorgram using a Langmuir 1:1 equation in order to generate an equilibrium association constant (KD)</p>Protein A HPLC.Supernatants were analyzed by Protein A HPLC using a POROS A/20 2.1x30mm Id column (Applied Biosystems) connected to an Agilent 1100 chromatography system. The column was equilibrated with PBS pH7.4, and protein was eluted with PBS adjusted to pH 2.2. A standard curve was generated using known amounts of a monoclonal antibody in PBS. The chromatograms, at the wavelengths of 215 nm or 280 nm, were integrated using the manufacturer's software and the area under the curve (AUC) reported and interpolated against the generated standard curve to estimate concentration.</p>Flow cytometry binding of antibodies and Anti-CD38-attenuated IFN fusion proteins to a human CD38 positive cell line, ARP-1 and H929.The multiple myeloma cell line ARP-1 was a gift from Bart Barlogie MD, PhD, Director of the Myeloma Institute at the University of Arkansas Medical Center (Little Rock, AK). It is described in Hardin J. et al. (1994) Blood. 84:3063-70). The multiple myeloma cell line NCI-H929 (H929) was purchased from ATCC (CRL-9068, Gazdar, Blood 67: 1542-1549, 1986).</p>The ability of the antibodies or antibody-interferon constructs to bind the human CD38-positive myeloma cell lines ARP-1 or H929 in flow cytometry-based assays was tested. ARP-1 cells or H929 cells (5 x 10<sup>5</sup>, as judged by trypan blue exclusion) were incubated with each protein or with a human IgG4 monoclonal antibody with irrelevant specificity protein construct at various concentrations in 50 \u00b5L of F",
    "as adjusted to 3.0 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL in RPMI 1640 + 10% FBS. Then, 50\u00b5L of cell suspension was aliquoted into each well of a 96 well round bottom tissue culture plate (hereafter, \"experimental plate\") (TPP, cat# 92067). On a separate, sterile 96 well plate (hereafter, \"dilution plate\"; Costar, Corning, NY cat# 3879), test articles were serially diluted in duplicate in RPMI 1640 + 10% FBS. Then, 50 \u00b5L/well was transferred from the dilution plate to the experimental plate. The experimental plate was then incubated for four days at 37\u00b0 C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. A mixture of the manufacturer-supplied assay buffer and assay substrate (hereafter, \"CellTiter-Glo\u00ae reagent\", mixed according to the manufacturer's instructions) was added to the experimental plate at 100 \u00b5L/well. The plate was shaken for two minutes.</p>Then, 100 \u00b5L/well was transferred from the experimental plate to a 96 well flat bottom white opaque plate (hereafter, \"assay plate\"; BD Biosciences, Franklin 5 Lakes, NJ cat# 35 3296). The content of the assay plate was then allowed to stabilize in the dark for 15 minutes at room temperature. The plate was read on a Victor 3V Multilabel Counter (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, model# 1420-041) on the luminometry channel and the luminescence was measured. Results are presented as \"relative luminescence units\" (RLU).\nData was analyzed using Prism 5 (Graphpad, San Diego, CA) using non-linear regression and three parameter curve fit to determine the midpoint of the curve (EC50).</p>ARP-1 Cell proliferation assay: This assay was used to quantify the anti-proliferative activity of IFNs and antibody-IFN fusion protein constructs against CD38 antigen positive cells. ARP-1 cells express CD38 as cell surface associated antigens. The viability of cells was measured using the reagent CellTiter-Glo\u00ae, Cat #G7570, from Promega (Madison, Wisconsin). This is a luminescence-based assay that determines the viability of cells in culture by quantitation of ATP. The signal strength is proportional to the number of viable cells in a microtiter plate well.</p>The details of the assay are as follows: ARP-1 cells were cultured in a T175 flask (Costar, Corning, NY Lakes, NJ, cat# CLS431080) to a preferred density of between 2.0 x 10<sup>5</sup> and 2.0 x 10<sup>6</sup> viable cells/mL in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Mulgrave, VIC, cat # 11875-093) with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS; AusGeneX, Molendinar, QLD, Australia cat# FBS500S). Cells were harvested by centrifuging at 400 x g for five minutes, decanting the supernatant, and resuspending the cell pellet in RPMI 1640 + 10% FBS. Cells were then counted and the density was adjusted to 2.0 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL in RPMI 1640 + 10% FBS. Then, 50 \u00b5L of the cell suspension was aliquoted into each well of a 96-well flat bottom white opaque plate (hereafter, \"experimental plate\"; Costar, Corning, NY Lakes, NJ, cat# CLS3917). On a separate, sterile 96-well plate (hereafter, \"dilution plate\"; Costar, Corning, NY cat# 379",

All compounds will be dosed at 100 \u00b5g/dose (approximately 4.5 mg/kg) except vehicle group. Tumor volume will be measured twice weekly by caliper measurement.</p>Example 6Anti-CD38-attenuated IFN fusion protein with alternative constant regionA02.12 comprises an anti-CD38-attenuated IFN fusion protein in which the constant region of the protein is HC-L0-IFN-alpha (A145D) IgG4 (SEQ ID NO: 9). The heavy chain variable region of this antibody was reformatted onto an IgG1 constant region fused to A145D attenuated IFN-alpha2b (SEQ ID NO: 10). Co-expression of this heavy chain with the light chain of X02.107 (SEQ ID NO: 65) in HEK293E cells yielded antibody A02.112. Comparison of antibodies A02.12 and A02.112 using flow cytometry-based CD38-binding assays and potency assays demonstrates that other antibody constant regions, such as human IgG1, may also be used resulting in antibody-attenuated IFN fusion proteins with potent biologic activity equivalent to those generated using a human IgG4 constant region (Table 16b).\nTable 16bAnti-CD38-attenuated IFN fusion proteinFlow binding (EC<sub>50</sub> in \u00b5g/mL)Annexin V Assay (Fold change relative to untreated cells)Caspase Assay (Fold change relative to untreated cells)Cell Proliferation Assay IC<sub>50</sub> (pM)FiguresA02.123.40*1.402.7023.66Fig 21A02.112&lt;0.3*3.143.74N/TFig 21*Antibody was tested in a flow binding assay against H929 cell line.

The variable regions of these antibodies were superhumanized as described in U.S. Publ. No. 2003/0039649</patcit>. Briefly, canonical structures were assigned to each rodent heavy and light chain through inspection of their respective amino acid sequences. R10A2 was assigned the canonical structure 2-1-1/1-2 (V<sub>L</sub>/V<sub>H</sub>), R5E8 was assigned the canonical structure 4-1-1/1-2, and R5D1 was assigned the canonical structure 2-1-1/1-2. Human germline sequences of the same canonical structure were used as acceptor frameworks for the grafting of donor CDRs. Variants of the resulting superhumanized antibody genes containing amino acid substitutions at positions within their sequences deemed likely to be important for maintenance of their binding activity were also designed. The different heavy chain superhumanized variable regions are shown in Figure 7. The different light chain superhumanized variable regions are shown in Figure 8.</p>Heavy chain variable region sequences were subcloned into vector pEE6.4 containing a human IgG4 constant region possessing the substitution S228P fused to A145D attenuated IFN-alpha2b (SEQ ID NO: 9). Light chain variable regions were subcloned into vector pEE12.4 containing a human kappa constant region (SEQ ID NO: 5). Antibodies were produced through co-expression of heavy chains in pEE6.4 and light chains in pEE12.4 in CHO cells as described previously. Table 17 summarises the heavy- and light chain pairings used to produce each superhumanized 5D1-based protein. Table 18 details the heavy- and light chain pairings for the superhumanized 5E8-based protein generated, whilst the heavy- and light chain pairings used to generate superhumanzied 10A2-based proteins are given in Table 19. One-shot equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) ranking of the superhumanized antibodies was performed by BIAcore\u2122 analysis of the resulting CHO transfection supernatants. The method was used to determine if the antibodies expressed (Protein A capture) and had a level of binding activity to human CD38.\nTable 17Anti-CD38-attenuated IFN fusion proteinVariable Heavy SEQ ID NO:Variable Light SEQ ID NO:K<sub>D (M)</sub>Protein A capture (RU)A5D1.0 (chimeric)1141252.28 x 10<sup>-9</sup>N/AA5D1.11151262.95 x 10<sup>-8</sup>175A5D1.21151272.95 x 10<sup>-8</sup>289A5D1.31151282.35 x 10<sup>-8</sup>248A5D1.41151292.85 x 10<sup>-8</sup>427A5D1.51151301.84 x 10<sup>-7</sup>269A5D1.61151312.32 x 10<sup>-8</sup>338A5D1.71161261.05 x 10<sup>-8</sup>132A5D1.81161276.80 x 10<sup>-9</sup>263A5D1.91161289.93 x 10<sup>-8</sup>128A5D1.101161295.69 x 10<sup>-9</sup>358A5D1.111161301.64 x 10<sup>-8</sup>250A5D1.121161315.61 x 10<sup>-9</sup>345A5D1.131171261.44 x 10<sup>-8</sup>213A5D1.141171271.52 x 10<sup>-8</sup>344A5D1.151171281.46 x 10<sup>-8</sup>167A5D1.161171291.37 x 10<sup>-8</sup>524A5D1.171171303.28 x 10<sup>-8</sup>410A5D1.181171311.01 x 10<sup>-8</sup>396A5D1.191181261.01 x 10<sup>-8</sup>245A5D1.201181271.07 x 10<sup>-8</sup>282A5D1.211181287.94 x 10<sup>-9</sup>351A5D1.221181298.97 x 10<sup>-9</sup>566A5D1.231181302.14 x 10<sup>-8</sup>336A5D1.241181318.01 x 10<sup>-9</sup>319A5D1.25119126DNB165A5D1.26119127DNB286A5D1.27119128DNB265A5D1.28119129DNB493A5D1.29119130DNB275A5D1.30119131DNB263A5D1."
