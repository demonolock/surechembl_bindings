(The steroids were dissolved in 22.5 % aqueous 2-(hydroxypropyl)-3-cyclodextrin.) </p>Detailed Description of Certain Embodiments </p> [0035] In accordance with the present disclosure, it has been discovered that compounds having a 17(20)-Z-vinylcyano-substituted steroid structure, and more specifically a 3a-hydroxy-17(20)-Z-vinylcyano-substituted tetracyclic steroid structure, are neuroactive and are also suitable for use as anesthetics and in the treatment of disorders associated with GABA function, as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts and prodrugs thereof. The compounds may be used, for example, as an effective continuous infusion sedative for non-surgical procedures (e.g., colonoscopy). The compounds also offer advantages over anesthetics known in the art, such as a lower likelihood for bacterial contamination, as well as an improved relationship with solubilizing agents. </p>1. Steroid Structure </p> [0036] Generally speaking, the steroid of the present disclosure has a tetracyclic, fused ring structure, such as a cyclopenta[a]phenanthrene ring system (an embodiment of which is illustrated and discussed in greater detail below), wherein the exposition of the A ring has a hydroxyl substituent, preferably in the a-position, and the deposition of the D ring has a vinyl-cyano (e.g. , =CH(CN)) group, preferably in the Z-configuration, attached thereto. Notably, and as further detailed herein below, it has surprisingly been discovered that the activity of the steroids of the present disclosure are at least in part a function of the orientation or configuration of the carbon-carbon double bond of which C-I7 is a part. More specifically, and as further illustrated below, it has been discovered that when this carbon-carbon double bond is in the Z-configuration (or cis- configuration), and further when the CN group is on the C13 side of the molecule, the activity of the compound is notably higher, as compared to the alternative configuration (i.e., when the CN group is on the C16 side of the molecule). </p>[0037] For example, comparison of the IC50 values of the Compound 6a (the Z isomer) with Compound 6b (the E isomer) indicates that interchanging the relative positions of the C-20 substituents (H, CN) has a large effect on [<sup>35</sup>S]-TBPS </p>displacement potency. Compound 6a was about 17-fold more potent at displacing \n\n [<sup>35</sup>S]-TBPS than Compound 6b. A comparison of the IC<sub>5</sub>o values for Compounds 6a, 6b and 5c shows the effect that hydrogenation of the \u0394<sup>17(20)</sup> double bond present in Compound 6a and 6b has on binding potency. The change in conformation of the D- ring and the loss of the steric restraint imposed by the \u0394<sup>17(20)</sup> double bond increased the IC<sub>5</sub>o value of Compound 5c about eight-fold relative to Compound 6a, and decreased the IC50 value about twofold relative to Compound 6b. This disparity in displacement potency between Z and E isomers has also been observed in other 17-vinylcyano compounds studied, the Z isomer being about 10- to 20-fold more potent than the E isomer. </p><img id=\"imgf000009_0001\" path=\"imgf000009_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/206351223/WO/20120830/A2/002012/11/62/90/imgf000009_0001.tif\"/></p> 5c 6a 6b </p> [0038] More particularly, however, the present disclosure is directed, in certain embodiments, to a steroid having the structure of Formula (I): </p><img id=\"imgf000009_0002\" path=\"imgf000009_0002.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/206351213/WO/20120830/A2/002012/11/62/90/imgf000009_0002.tif\"/></p> (I) </p>or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; </p> wherein:</p><img id=\"imgf000009_0003\" path=\"imgf000009_0003.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/206351222/WO/20120830/A2/002012/11/62/90/imgf000009_0003.tif\"/></p>[0040] R<sub>2</sub> is =0, H, or OR<sub>a</sub>, where R<sub>a</sub> is selected from H, optionally substituted Ci-C<sub>4</sub> alkyl, or optionally substituted aryl, with the proviso that when R<sub>2</sub> is =0, Rs is not present; \n\n [0041 ] R<sub>3</sub> is H, optionally substituted Ci-C alkyl, optionally substituted C<sub>2</sub>-C alkene, optionally substituted C<sub>2</sub>-C alkyne, or optionally substituted aryl; </p>[0042] R<sub>4</sub> and R5 are each independently selected from ",

Removal of MeOH gave a residue to which water (50 mL) was added and the products extracted into CH2CI2 (3 x 60 mL).

Error limits are calculated as standard error of the mean. Methods used are known in the art (see Jiang, X., et al., Neurosteroid analogues.9. Conformationally constrained pregnanes: structure-activity studies of 13,24-cyclo-18,21 -dinorcholane analogues of the GABA modulatory and anesthetic steroids (3a, 5a)- and (3a,5a)-3-hydroxypregnan- 20-one. J. Med. Chem., 46: 5334-48 (2003)). </p>[00210] <sup>0</sup>These values were obtained from Bandyopadhyaya, et al. </p>[00211 ] Compounds 1 -4 were the reference compounds for this study and the binding results reported are those discussed in Bandyopadhyaya, et al. Compound 5a is the C-17 aldehyde analogue of Compounds 2 and 4. Comparison of the IC50 values for [<sup>35</sup>S]-TBPS displacement potency for Compounds 2 and 5a shows that changing the C-17 acetyl group to an aldehyde group improves displacement potency by about twofold. Compound 5b, which lacks the \u0394<sup>16</sup> double bond, is about equal to Compound 5a as a displacer of [<sup>35</sup>S]-TBPS. Thus, it appears that the \u0394<sup>16</sup> double bond has no \n\n adverse effect on displacement potency when the compound does not contain a C-21 methyl group. A comparison of the IC50 values for Compounds 3 and 4 leads to a similar conclusion when the C-17 substituent is a nitrile group. Comparison of the IC50 values for Compounds 4 and 5a shows about a threefold difference in potency in favor of Compound 4. A comparison of the IC50 values of Compounds 3 and 5c indicates that moving the nitrile group off of the steroid D-ring into a side chain that can undergo free rotation lowers potency for [<sup>35</sup>S]-TBPS displacement about fivefold. </p>[00212] Compound 6a is an isosteric analogue of Compound 5a. The 6a nitrile group lies along the axis of the atoms in the carbonyl group of Compound 5a (see Figure 2). Additionally, the nitrile and carbonyl groups are both hydrogen bond acceptors. The [<sup>35</sup>S]-TBPS displacement results obtained with Compounds 2 and 5a suggest that compound 6a should have an IC50 value more similar to that of Compound 5a than to that of Compound 2 since Compound 6a does not have a C-21 methyl group. Indeed, this was found to be the case with Compound 6a being about eightfold more potent than Compound 5a, but about 17-fold more potent than Compound 2. Surprisingly, Compound 6a was about twofold more potent than the clinically used steroid anesthetic alphaxalone (Compound 1 ). Additionally, Compound 6a has an IC50 value very similar to that of Compound 4 in spite of the fact that the nitrile group in each steroid is oriented differently with respect to the axis of a vector passing through the mid-point of the C-14.C-15 and C-17 bond. </p>[00213] Comparison of the IC50 values of Compounds 6a (Z isomer) and 6b (E isomer) indicates that interchanging the relative positions of the C-20 substituents (H, CN) has a large effect on [<sup>35</sup>S]-TBPS displacement potency. Compound 6a was about 17-fold more potent at displacing [<sup>35</sup>S]-TBPS than Compound 6b. A comparison of the IC50 values for Compounds 6a, 6b and 5c shows the effect that hydrogenation of the \u0394<sup>17(20)</sup> double bond present in Compound 6a and 6b has on binding potency. The change in conformation of the D-ring and the loss of the steric restraint imposed by the \u0394<sup>17(20)</sup> double bond increased the IC50 value of Compound 5c about eightfold relative to Compound 6a, and decreased the IC50 value about twofold relative to Compound 6b. </p>[00214] The disparity in displacement potency between Z and E isomers noted above was also observed in compounds 13-17, the Z isomer being about 10- to 20-fold more potent than the E isomer. Comparison between 6a and 13a, and between 14a and 15a \n\n seemed to suggest that isomers with C-5 a-configuration (6a and 14a) may be more potent than those with C-5 \u03b2-configuration (13a and 15a). Moreover, comparison between 6a, 14a, and 17a seemed to suggest that C-1 1 substitution may also affect the potency, with C-1 1 H (14a) being about 2-fold stronger than C-1 1 MeO (17a) and about 5-fold stronger than C-1 1 carbonyl (6a). </p>[00215] Compound 6c (Z isomer) is an analogue of Compound 2 (the nitrile group replaces the carbonyl group) in its minimum energy conformation and compound 6d (E isomer) is an analogue of Compound 2 in its high energy U-conformation (i.e., the conformation in which the relative positions of the carbonyl and C-21 methyl groups are interchanged). The compounds differ from the 6a and 6b analogues only by the presence of the C-21 methyl group in their structures. A comparison of Compound 6a and 6c shows displacement potency is decreased about fivefold by the C-21 methyl group. By contrast, a comparison of Compound 6b and 6d shows no significant effect on displacement potency. Thus, the C-21 methyl group has a negative effect on the [<sup>35</sup>S]-TBPS displacement potency of the Z isomer (6c), but little eff",
    "minimally when the concentration was increased from 1 \u03bc\u039c to 1 0 \u03bc\u039c. As a potentiator, Compound 5a has a profile more similar to that of Compound 4 than to that of Compound 2. These results correlate well with the [<sup>35</sup>S]- TBPS displacement results where Compound 5a was found to be more potent than Compound 2, but less potent than Compound 4 at displacing [<sup>35</sup>S]-TBPS. </p>[00221 ] Hydrogenation of the \u0394<sup>16</sup> double bond in Compound 5a had little effect on activity since Compounds 5a and 5b both show a similar potentiation of GABA- \n\n mediated currents when their concentrations are increased from 1 \u03bc\u039c to 10 \u03bc\u039c. The result is in striking contrast to the effect this structural difference has on the GABAergic actions of Compounds 1 and 2, but similar to the effect it has on the GABAergic actions of Compounds 3 and 4. Comparison of the potentiation results for Compounds 3 and 5c shows that having the nitrile group directly attached to C-17 yields the more active compound. All of these results correlate with those found for potency of [<sup>35</sup>S]-TBPS displacement. </p>[00222] Table 2 qualitatively suggests that Compound 6a is a strong potentiator. In order to quantitatively distinguish enhancement differences for Compounds 6a, 6b and 5c, these three compounds were directly compared at a concentration of 10 \u03bc\u039c on the same oocytes (Figure 3). Compound 6a strongly enhanced GABA-mediated currents. These functional results correlate with the order of the IC50 values for [<sup>35</sup>S]-TBPS displacement by these compounds. In addition, other Z isomer steroids (e.g., 13a, 15a- 17a) showed stronger potency at 10 \u03bc\u039c than their E isomer counterparts. Interestingly, 14a (Z isomer) was more potent than 14b (E isomer) at lower concentrations, and was slightly more potent than 14b at 10 \u03bc\u039c. Both 14a and 14b were generally less potent than the other Z-isomer steroids tested. The fact that 14a was the most potent Z- isomer in the [35S]-TBPS displacement test, but was the least potent Z-isomer in the electrophysiology test, suggests that compound 14a may potentially be a partial agonist. </p>Tadpole Loss of Righting and Swimming </p> [00223] Table 3 discloses the anesthetic effects of the compounds of the present disclosure.

Unlike Compound 2, which did not cause LRR, Compound 5a does cause LRR with an EC50 of about 3 \u03bc\u039c. The concentration-response curve found for Compound 5a is very steep and unique among the compounds in this study. Compound 5b, the compound produced by hydrogenation of Compound 5a, had LRR and LSR EC50 values comparable to those of Compound 5a. </p>[00229] Compound 6a is about eightfold and about threefold more potent than Compound 6b at causing LRR and LSR, respectively. Compounds 6c and 6d have similar tadpole LRR EC<sub>50</sub> values, but only Compound 6c causes LSR with an EC<sub>50</sub> below 10 \u03bc\u039c. Comparison of tadpole LRR EC<sub>50</sub> values for the Z isomers 6a and 6c shows that the presence of the C-21 methyl group in the steroid decreases the potency of the Z isomer for tadpole LRR slightly more than twofold. The same comparison for the E isomers 6b and 6d shows that the C-21 methyl group increases the potency of the E isomer slightly more than fourfold. Compound 5c, the hydrogenation product of either Compound 6a or 6b, is less potent than Compound 6a and more potent than steroid 6b at causing tadpole LRR, and it does not cause LSR at concentration &lt; 10 \u03bc\u039c. Figure 5 shows a rank order correlation for the [<sup>35</sup>S-TBPS] IC50 values and tadpole LRR EC<sub>50</sub> values for compounds 1 through 6d. The correlation coefficient is 0.8 (p &lt; 0.05), which indicates a strong correlation between these parameters. Other Z isomer steroids (e.g., 15a-17a) were also observed to be more potent than their E isomer counterparts (i.e., 15b-17b, respectively), which further supports the difference in potency observed in Z/E isomers 6a and 6b. The lack of anesthetic activity of compound 14a is consistent with the suggestion made from the electrophysiological evaluation that this compound may potentially be a partial agonist. Compound 14a appears to be unique in this regard, among the Z isomers examined here. </p>Anesthesia in Mice </p> [00230] An assessment of the potency, rate of onset and recovery of Compound 6a relative to the parameters for Compound 1 (alphaxalone) was made using tail vein injections in mice.
