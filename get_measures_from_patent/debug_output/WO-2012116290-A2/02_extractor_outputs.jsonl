{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n* For example, comparison of the IC50 values of the Compound 6a (the Z isomer) with Compound 6b (the E isomer) indicates that interchanging the relative positions of the C-20 substituents (H, CN) has a large effect on [<sup>35</sup>S]-TBPS displacement potency, Compound 6a was about 17-fold more potent at displacing [<sup>35</sup>S]-TBPS than Compound 6b.\n* A comparison of the IC<sub>5</sub>o values for Compounds 6a, 6b and 5c shows the effect that hydrogenation of the \u0394<sup>17(20)</sup> double bond present in Compound 6a and 6b has on binding potency, The change in conformation of the D- ring and the loss of the steric restraint imposed by the \u0394<sup>17(20)</sup> double bond increased the IC<sub>5</sub>o value of Compound 5c about eight-fold relative to Compound 6a, and decreased the IC50 value about twofold relative to Compound 6b.\n* This disparity in displacement potency between Z and E isomers has also been observed in other 17-vinylcyano compounds studied, the Z isomer being about 10- to 20-fold more potent than the E isomer.\n* Figures 3A and 3B are graphs illustrating a direct quantitative comparison of Compounds 6a, 6b and 5c at 10 \u03bc\u039c on responses to GABA in Xenopus oocytes expressing \u03b1\u03b9\u03b2<sub>2</sub>\u03b32\u03af GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits.\n* Figure 4 is a graph illustrating a summary of normalized responses of oocytes to co-applied GABA (2 \u03bc\u039c) plus 1 \u03bc\u039c (left set of bars) or 10 \u03bc\u039c (right set of bars) of the compounds indicated therein.\n* Figure 5 is a graph illustrating the rank order correlation plot of the analogue [<sup>35</sup>S]-TBPS IC50 values with their corresponding tadpole LRR EC50 values."}
