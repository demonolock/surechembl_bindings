The inhibitory dissociation constant (Ki) of each bryologue ligand was determined by the ability of the ligand to displace bound [20- <sup>3</sup>H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) from mouse recombinant isozyme PKC \u03b1 in the presence of calcium and phosphatidylserine, using a polyethylene glycol precipitation assay developed in our laboratory as described elsewhere. Briefly, the assay mixture (250 \u03bcL) contained 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4 at room temperature), 100 \u03bcg/mL phosphatidylserine, 0.1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, 4 mg/mL bovine immunoglobulin G and .003% Tx-100, 2 nM [<sup>3</sup>H]PDBu and various concentrations of the competing ligand. The assay tubes were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 5 minutes, then chilled for 10 minutes on ice, after which 200 \u03bcL of 35% polyethylene glycol 6000 in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) was added. The tubes were vortexed and chilled an additional 10 minutes and then centrifuged in a Beckman Allegra 21R centrifuge at 4\u00b0C (12,200 rpm, 15 min). A 100 \u03bcL aliquot of each supernatant was removed and placed in a scintillation vial for the determination of the free concentration of [<sup>3</sup>H]PDBu. Each assay pellet, located in the tip of the assay tube, was carefully dried, cut off, and placed in a scintillation vial for the determination of the total bound [<sup>3</sup>H]PDBu. The radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting, using Cytoscint (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA). Specific binding was calculated as the difference between total and nonspecific PDBu binding.

In marked contrast to analogue 4, the response of MERLE 28 in the attachment assay approaches that of bryostatin 1 itself. MERLE 28 can be seen even to display the dose-dependent biphasic response characteristic of exposure to bryostatin 1. In addition, MERLE 28, like bryostatin 1, is a functional antagonist of</p>PMA and blocks the effect of the phorbol ester when the two agents are administered together.</p>The inhibition of U937 cell proliferation induced by compound 12 compared to bryostatin 1 and PMA. U937 cells were treated with PMA (0.01-100 nM), bryostatinl (0.1-1000 nM), analogue 12 (0.1-1000 nM), 10 nM PMA with different concentrations of bryostatin 1 (0.1-1000 nM) or 10 nM PMA with different concentrations of analogue 12 (0.1-1000 nM). The numbers of attached and non- attached cells were counted and the number of total cells was expressed as % of control. The bars and error bars represent the average and the standard error of the \n\n mean of at least three independent experiments.</p>The results with MERLE 28 in the proliferation assay (Figure 17) are likewise very similar to those for bryostatin 1. In this assay, bryostatin 1 is not strongly antiproliferative, whereas the phorbol ester PMA is. Moreover, bryostatin 1 is able to block the effect of PMA in a dose dependent manner. Both of these aspects of bryostatin 1 induced biological response are captured by MERLE 28.</p>[<sup>3</sup>H]PDBu Binding Assay: The inhibitory dissociation constant (K,) of MERLE 28was determined by the ability of the ligand to displace bound [20-<sup>3</sup>H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) from mouse recombinant isozyme PKC\u03b1 in the presence of calcium and phosphatidylserine, using a polyethylene glycol precipitation assay previously described by Blumberg and Lewin.

Diisopropylamine, diisopropylethylamine, pyridine, triethylamine, EtOAc, MeOH, and CH<sub>2</sub>CI<sub>2</sub> were distilled from CaH<sub>2</sub>. The titer of H-BuLi was determined by the method of Eastham and Watson (/. Organomet. Chem. 1967, 9, 165). All other reagents were used without further purification. Yields were calculated for material judged homogenous by thin layer chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Thin layer chromatography was performed on Merck Kieselgel 60 A F254 plates or Silicycle 6\u03b8A F254 eluting with the solvent indicated, visualized by a 254 nm UV lamp, and stained with an ethanolic solution of 12-molybdophosphoric acid, or 4-anisaldehyde. Flash column chromatography was performed with Silicycle Flash Silica Gel 40 - 63 \u03bcm or Silicycle Flash Silica Gel 60 - 200 \u03bcm, slurry packed with 1% EtOAc/hexanes in glass columns. Glassware for reactions was oven dried at 125 <sup>0</sup>C and cooled under a dry nitrogen atmosphere prior to use.
