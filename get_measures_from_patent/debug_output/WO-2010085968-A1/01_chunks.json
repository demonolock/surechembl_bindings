    "gdong Ke and Max Costa, Molecular Pharmacology (2006), vol. 70, no. 5.</p>As a result of hypoxia, augmented levels of a heterodimeric complex of transcription factors (Hypoxia Inducible Factor, HIF), most notably HIF- l\u03b1 and HIF- l\u03b2, are observed in e.g. tumors to compensate in cooperation with additional co-factors for the reduced availability of oxygen and nutrients in this fast growing tissue type. Under anaerobic conditions, homeostasis of HIF-I \u03b1 is imbalanced by its reduced degradation, thus enabeling enhanced signaling through the Hypoxia Responsive Element (HRE) and resulting in increased expression of a large number of survival and growth factors.</p>Hypoxic conditions are also found in non-tumor tissue. For example, retinopathy is a general term that refers to non-inflammatory damage to the retina of the eye. This condition is most commonly caused by an insufficient blood supply leading to hypoxia. Particularly people with diabetes mellitus are at risk of retinopathy. The lack of oxygen in the retina of diabetics causes fragile, new, blood vessels to grow along the retina and in the clear, gel-like vitreous humour that fills the inside of the eye. Without timely treatment, these new blood vessels can bleed, cloud vision, and destroy the retina. Fibrovascular proliferation can also cause fractional \n\n retinal detachment. The new blood vessels can also grow into the anterior chamber of the eye and cause neovascular glaucoma.</p>Recently, evidence has accumulated that inhibition of HIF-I activity could also act to prevent inflammation, by virtue of its role in the activation and infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils into affected tissues (see e.g. Giaccia et al., Drug Discovery, vol. 2, October 2003). For the above-outlined reasons, compounds that inhibit HIF function are valuable medicaments for the treatment or prevention of a disease or disorder selected from the group consisting of an inflammatory disease, a hyperproliferative disease or disorder, a hypoxia- related pathology and a disease characterized by excessive vascularisation. Because of the importance of HIF-I in tumor development, progression and metastasis, a considerable amount of effort has been devoted to identify HIF-I inhibitors for cancer therapy. A number of small molecules and RNA constructs, like siRNA, have been reported to exhibit inhibition of the HIF-I pathway, e.g. Kung AL et al, Cancer Cell (2004), vol. 6, p. 33 ff; Rapisarda A, et al. Cancer Res. (2002), vol. 62, p. 4316 ff.; Tan C.et al, Cancer Res. (2005), vol. 65, p. 605 ff; Mabjeesh NJ, et al, Cancer Cell, (2003), vol. 3, p. 363ff;. Kong X, et al, MoI Cell Biol (2006) , vol. 26, p. 2019 ff; Kong D, et al, Cancer Res. (2005), vol. 65, p. 9047 ff; Chau N. et al., Cancer Res. (2005), vol. 65, p. 4918 ff; Welsh S, et al., MoI Cancer Ther (2004), vol. 3, p. 233 ff. However, these compounds often have activities other than HIF-I inhibition, and most of them lack the desired pharmacokinetic properties or toxicity profiles required for a useful pharmaceutical agent. Furthermore, some of the compounds have the disadvantage that they can not be administered orally, such as the HIF-I inhibitor EZN-2968, which is a locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotide.</p>The scientific literature cited above emphasizes the high medical need for new therapeutic agents to provide more efficient treatment of different proliferative and inflammatory diseases or disorders, hypoxia-related pathologies and diseases characterized by excessive vascularisation.</p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</p>The present invention provides novel compounds capable of prevention or treatment of a disease or disorder. Data presented herein establish that compounds according to the present invention are surprisingly very potent inhibitors of (i) the activation of HIF mediated transcription under hypoxic conditions and of (ii) cell proliferation.</p>In a first aspect the present invention relates to a compound having a structure according to formula I: \n\n \n<img id=\"imgf000005_0001\" path=\"imgf000005_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/168588142/WO/20100805/A1/002010/08/59/68/imgf000005_0001.tif\"/>\n</p>(I) wherein R<sup>1</sup> is a monocyclic 5- or 6-membered heteroaryl; optionally substituted with one or more substituents selected from the group consisting of: H, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, -CN, halogen, N-O (wherein the ni",
    "itors. For example, the compounds of the present invention were shown to inhibit the activation of HIF-mediated transcription under hypoxic conditions. Thus, the compounds of the invention can be used for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of a disorder \n\n characterized by pathophysiological HIF signaling. A person skilled in the art of medical, biological and/or pharmacological science can determine with routine methodology if a disorder is characterized by undesirable HIF signaling. Tissues affected by such diseases will overexpress genes that are induced by activation of the HIF responsive element (HRE). HIF-I acts by binding to HIF-responsive elements (HREs) in promoters that generally contain the sequence NCGTG. The genes affected by HIF activity which are regulated by said promoters are well known in the art and were also described in multiple reviews (see e.g. figure 3 of Gregg L. Semenza, Nature Reviews, Oct. 2003, vol. 3).</p>In animal studies, HIF-I overexpression is associated with increased tumor growth, increased vascularisation, metastasis and fibrosis, e.g. renal fibrosis (see: Semenza, G, Drug Discovery Today, vol. 12, no. 19/20, October 2007; Kimura, Kuniko, et al., American Journal of Physiology (2008), 295(4, Pt. 2), F1023-F1029 and for a review see NJ. Mabjeesh et al., Histol. Histopathol (2007) 22:559-572). Fibrosis is the formation or development of excess fibrous connective tissue in an organ or tissue. Recently, it has become clear that inhibition of HIF-I activity also acts to prevent inflammation, by virtue of its essential role in the activation and infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils into affected tissues (see e.g. Giaccia et al., Drug Discovery, vol. 2, October 2003).</p>Pharmaceutical compositions For the above mentioned reasons, a compound of the present invention can be used to treat an inflammatory disease, a hyperproliferative disease or disorder, a hypoxia related pathology and also diseases characterized by pathophysiological hyper-vascularisation. Therefore, as a further aspect, the invention provides a therapeutical composition wherein the compound of the invention is combined with at least one further pharmaceutically active compound that is useful to treat one of the aforementioned diseases or disorders. Such therapeutical compositions are useful because the therapeutic efficiency of the compounds of the invention can be amplified by the presence of said at least one further pharmaceutically active compound and vice versa. For example, it was shown that inhibiting HIF l\u03b1 activity via antisense gene therapy enhances the therapeutic efficacy of doxorubicin to combat hepatocellular carcinoma (see Liu, Fengjun et. al., Cancer Science (2008), 99(10), 2055- 2061).</p>Thus, in a further aspect, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound according to the invention or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a second therapeutic agent useful for the",
    "sia, odontogenic dysplasia, ophthalmomandibulomelic dysplasia, periapical cemental dysplasia, polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, pseudoachondroplastic spondyloepiphysial dysplasia, retinal dysplasia, septo-optic dysplasia, spondyloepiphysial dysplasia, and ventriculoradial dysplasia.</p>Estrogen receptor refers to a group of receptors which are activated by the hormone 17\u03b2-estradiol (estrogen). Two types of estrogen receptor exist: ER which is a member of the nuclear hormone family of intracellular receptors and the estrogen G protein coupled receptor GPR30 (GPER), which is a G-protein coupled receptor. Estrogen and the estrogen receptors have been implicated in breast cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer and endometrial cancer and other diseases. As the compounds of the invention are capable of inhibiting estrogen receptor-mediated transcriptional activity, they can be used to treat said diseases.</p>Thus, in a further preferred embodiment, the hyperproliferative disorders treatable according to the invention are those which benefit from a reduced estrogen receptor signalling, i.e. disorders associated with an increased estrogen receptor signaling, if compared to healthy tissue. This particular suitability of the compounds of the present invention is based on the fact, that the compounds of the present invention potentially through inhibiting cellular replication but possibly also through an additional activity of the compounds of the present invention exert an inhibition of estrogen receptor signaling. Thus, preferred diseases, conditions and/or disorders which can be treated are selected from the group consisting of mammary tumors, endometrial tumors and tumors of the uterus. Whether a disease is associated an increased estrogen receptor activity can be measured by a variety of art known methods including determination of ER expression level in the diseased tissue by, e.g. immunological methods, \n\n which determine the amount of expressed protein, by methods determining the amount of transcribed ER encoding nucleic acids, e.g. RT-PCR, Northern-blots, nuclear run-ons etc., and determining the activity of a nucleic acid construct comprising an ER-receptor recognition element, which drives expression of a detectable reporter, e.g. CAT, luciferase, GFP etc as described in more detail in the Experimental Section below. Preferably, the disorders which benefit from a reduced estrogen receptor signaling are those, which show in the diseased tisse an increase in estrogen receptor signaling by at least 10%, preferably by at least 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, if compared to healthy tissue. Preferably this increase is measured on the basis of a nucleic acid comprising an ER-receptor recognition element and the increase of the expression of a reporter driven by this element.</p>In therapeutic use as an antagonist of estrogen receptor signaling, acting through inhibition of cellular replication, the compounds utilized in the use of the invention are administered at the initial dosage of about 0.02 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg daily. A daily dose range of about 0.05 mg/kg to about 2 mg/kg is preferred, with a daily dose range of about 0.05 mg/kg to about 1 mg/kg being most preferred. The dosages, however, may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient, the severity of the condition being treated, and the compound being employed. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the practitioner. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages, which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under circumstances is reached. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day, if desired.</p>Salts / esters</p>The compounds within the compositions or compounds usable according to the present invention can be present as salts or esters, in particular pharmaceutically acceptable salts or esters. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the invention include suitable acid addition or base salts thereof. A review of suitable pharmaceutical salts may be found in Berge et al, J Pharm Sci, 66, 1-19 (1977). Salts are formed, for example with strong inorganic acids such as mineral acids, e.g. sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid or hydrohalic acids; with s",

Mass signals were determined using a Waters 3100 Mass Detector.</p>Example 3: General Cell Culture Maintenance and Cell Proliferation Assays MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells were obtained from ATCC (LGC</p>Promochem). The CellSensor\u00ae HRE-bla HCTl 16 cell line (colorectal carcinoma) was obtained from Invitrogen.</p>Cells were grown under humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C in Dulbecco's modified</p>Eagle's medium (DMEM: MCF-7) or McCoy's 5 A medium (HRE-bla HCTl 16) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100U/ml penicillin and lOO\u03bcg/ml streptomycin, 2mM L- \n\n glutamine, and blasticidin at 5\u03bcg/ml as a selection marker (for the HRE-bla HCTl 16 cell line only).</p>Cell proliferation experiments were carried out in 96-well tissue culture plates with seeding of 2000 cells/well in lOO\u03bcl of the relevant medium. Cells were subsequently incubated under the conditions mentioned for 24h prior to addition of compounds.</p>To determine the degree of inhibition of cell proliferation, cells were treated with ATPlite solution according to the manufacturer's instructions (PerkinElmer, ATPlite 1-step Luminescence ATP Detection Assay System) and luciferase readout measured on an Envision HTS multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer) in luminescence mode according to established protocols. Raw data were imported into an ActivityBase database (IDBS, ID Business Solutions) and EC50 values calculated using the IDBS program ActivityBase XE. Table 2 shows the IC<sub>50</sub> values obtained in the above-outlined cell proliferation assay for exemplary compounds of the invention. The cell proliferation assay data show that the compounds of the invention can inhibit cell proliferation in cancer cell lines.</p>Reference: EC<sub>50</sub> &lt; 500 nM: +++ 500 - 100O nM: &gt; 1 \u03bcM + \n<img id=\"imgf000048_0001\" path=\"imgf000048_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/168588185/WO/20100805/A1/002010/08/59/68/imgf000048_0001.tif\"/>\n \n\n Example 4: Inhibition of In Vitro Tubulin Polymerization</p>To assess the degree of inhibition of in vitro tubulin polymerization, a tubulin solution (prepared in-house from porcine brain using a standard procedure involving cycles of polymerization/de-polymerization, (see Castoldi &amp; Popov (2003) Protein Expr. Purif. 32(1): 83-88), was incubated with varying concentrations of compounds under polymerizing conditions and kinetic experiments performed to determine the amount of polymerization (as measured by changes in OD at 340nm) taking place over a 90min period. Compound solutions were diluted in double-distilled water to yield final 1 OX solutions containing 5% DMSO. 5\u03bcl solutions were then added to the wells on a 384-well clear-bottom plate (Corning #3711, Corning Inc.) in preparation for the addition of tubulin. The tubulin solution (19.6mg/ml, in 8OmM K-PIPES [pH 6.8], ImM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, ImM EGTA) was re- suspended to a final concentration of 4mg/ml with ice cold G-PEM buffer (8OmM PIPES [pH 6.8], 2mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5mM EGTA, 10% glycerol, ImM GTP) and maintained on ice for at least lmin. 50\u03bcl was then added to the pre-dispensed compound solutions, the plate orbital shaken on a medium setting for 5 s, and the first measurement begun immediately.</p>Experiments were carried out on a Safire<sup>2</sup> \u2122 monochromator (Tecan) preset to a stable temperature of 37\u00b0C; the degree of polymerization was determined by measuring the absorbance of the solutions at 340nm every minute over the 90min cycle. Reported inhibition values were based on the final absorbance at 90min and calculated with reference to a vehicle control (0.5% DMSO) using the minimum and maximum signals obtained for this sample.</p>As demonstrated by these experiments (see Table 2), changes in the structural properties of the various examples can lead to a selection of compounds that are active in inhibiting cell proliferation and affect HIF-signaling, but that do, or do not, have tubulin inhibition properties, depending on whether this is desired in the target product profile.</p>Reference: Inhibition at 10 \u03bcM &gt; 50%: +</p>20 - 50%: +/- &lt; 20%</p>Example 5: Inhibition of Activation of HIF Mediated Transcription under Hypoxic Conditions</p>Inhibition of an activated HIF signaling response under chemically- induced hypoxic conditions due to compound treatment was determined using the CellSensor\u00ae HRE-bla HCT-116 stably \n\n transfected reporter cell line from Invitrogen according to the manufacturer's instructions. HIF is a transcriptional factor composed of the constitutively expressed HIF l\u03b2 subunit and one of three HIF\u03b1 subunits (HIF l\u03b1, HIF2\u03b1, HIF3\u03b1). This assay is responsive towards HIF\u03b1 activity in general. In one example, HIF-I, when stabilized by hypoxic conditions, upregulates several genes to promote cell survival in low-oxygen conditions. These include glycolysis enzymes, which allow ATP synthesis in an oxygen-independent manner, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which promotes angiogenesis. HIF-I acts by binding to HIF -responsive elements (HREs) in promoters that generally contain the sequence NCGTG.</p>Cells were maintained as described previously and seeded into 384-well, clear-bottom plates (Corning 3712) at 15000 cells/well in 32\u03bcl assay medium (Opti-MEM [Invitrogen], 0.5% FBS, 100U/ml penicillin, lOO\u03bcg/ml streptomycin, 0.ImM non-essential amino acids [NEAA], ImM sodium pyruvate, 5mM HEPES [pH 7.3]). Following a 2h incubation period, compounds (4\u03bcl) were subsequently added to the cells at 1OX concentrations in 5% DMSO and incubated under normal conditions for 30min. To induce hypoxic conditions, 4\u03bcl of a 2mM deferoxamine (DFO) solution was added to the cells followed by 24h incubation "
