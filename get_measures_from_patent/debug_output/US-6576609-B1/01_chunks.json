    "r other affinity chromatography procedures that remove serine proteases or the plasmin catalytic domain. The angiostatin may also be purified from the reaction mixture using an antibody that binds selectively to it (see below).</p>The angiostatin produced by these methods (native angiostatin) has been characterized. It reacts with a monoclonal antibody specific for kringles 1-3 of plasminogen and has been found to inhibit angiogenesis as assessed by a variety of tests in vitro and in vivo.</p>It has also been found to have the N-terminal sequence of plasmin. For angiostatin produced from human plasminogen, the N-terminal sequence has been found to be Lys Val Tyr Leu Ser Glu Cys Lys Thr Gly [SEQ ID NO:1]. The sequences of the plasmin of other animals are known. Thus, native angiostatin of a particular animal would have the same N-terminal sequence as the plasmin of that animal.</p>Quite surprisingly, native angiostatin has been found to have its C-terminal amino acid located in kringle 5. In particular, angiostatin produced from human plasminogen has been found to have the C-terminal sequence Cys Tyr Thr Thr Asn Pro Arg [SEQ ID NO:4] or Cys Tyr Thr Thr Asn Pro Arg Lys [SEQ ID NO:5] (see Example 6). These C-terminal sequences would result from a cleavage after amino acid 529 or 530 of plasminogen (see FIG. 16), which are known plasmin cleavage sites. Thus, native human angiostatin comprises most of kringle 5 (see FIG. 16), which is consistent with its molecular weight of 50-60 kD on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions.</p>These findings were surprising because it had been thought that angiostatin contained kringles 1-3 and part or all of kringle 4 (see Background section). Also, it has been shown that a molecule consisting of kringles 1-4, while active, was less active than a molecule consisting of kringles 1-3 (see PCT application WO 96/35774). Thus, it was unanticipated that native angiostatin would include any portion of kringle 5. It was particularly unanticipated that native angiostatin would include most of kringle 5.</p>It is now expected that plasminogen fragments, other than native angiostatin, including at least a portion of kringle 5 will possess angiostatin activity (i.e., will inhibit angiogenesis). Preferably the plasminogen fragment comprises the majority of kringle 5. More preferably the plasminogen fragment comprises most of kringle 5. As used herein \u201cmajority of kringle 5\u201d means at least 50% of kringle 5 (e.g., at least 40 amino acids for human kringle 5), and \u201cmost of kringle 5\u201d means at least 75% of kringle 5 (e.g., at least 60 amino acids for human kringle 5). Of course, the plasminogen fragment is most preferably native angiostatin for the reasons given above.</p>The sequences of plasminogens from other animals are known (available from, e.g., GenBank). The sequences of human [SEQ ID NO:6], bovine [SEQ ID NO:7], canine [SEQ ID NO:8], western European hedgehog [SEQ ID NO:9], horse [SEQ ID NO:10], rh",
    "ce were assayed for angiostatin by Western blot (performed as described in Example 1). As a control, two mice were injected subcutaneously with 1.00 mg of affinity-purified, cell-free angiostatin twice a day beginning on day 1 until 24 hours prior to sacrifice. Affinity-purified, cell-free angiostatin was generated as described in Example 3 and affinity purified on a lysine-sepharose column as described in Example 1. The results are shown in FIG. 15. As can be seen, administration of NAC to the mice caused the production of angiostatin in vivo (Lanes 5, 6 and 7). No angiostatin production was detected in control mice (Lanes 1 and 2).</p>Example 6Determination of the C-Terminal Sequence of Native AngiostatinNative angiostatin was generated by incubating human plasminogen (0.2 \u03bcM) with recombinant human u-PA (0.2 nM) (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, Ill.) and 100 \u03bcM N-acetyl-L-cysteine at 37\u00b0 C. overnight. The material was then applied to a lysine-sepharose column (see Example 1), and the flow-through material was collected and concentrated. Aliquots of the concentrated flow-through material were electropheresed under non-reducing conditions on 12% polyacrylamide gels (NOVEX, San Diego, Calif.) in Tris-Glycine running buffer, electrotransferred to a 0.45 \u03bcm polyvinylene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Immobilon, Millipore, Bedford, Mass.), and proteins stained with Coomassie blue.</p>The stained membrane showed two very prominent bands from the flow-through at approximately 30 kD. Although other bands were observed, the staining of these bands was considerably less than the staining of the two 30 kD bands, indicating that the two 30 kD bands contained the predominant constituents of the flow-through.</p>The N-terminal sequences of the proteins in the two 30 kD bands were determined by microsequence analysis as described in Example 1. The N-terminal sequence of the most prominent of the two bands was Lys Leu Tyr Asp Tyr Cys Asp Val [SEQ ID NO:2], while the sequence of the other band was Leu Tyr Asp Tyr Cys Asp Val [SEQ ID NO:3]. The location of these sequences in kringle 5 of plasminogen (see FIG. 16) and the prominence of the two bands provided extremely strong evidence that these were the fragments released as a result of the cleavage of plasminogen to form the C-terminal of native angiostatin. From the N-terminal sequences of the two 30 kD fragments, it was deduced that the C-terminal sequence of the native angiostatin was Cys Tyr Thr Thr Asn Pro Arg [SEQ ID NO:4] or Cys Tyr Thr Thr Asn Pro Arg Lys [SEQ ID NO:5]. These C-terminal sequences would be formed by cleavage after amino acid 529 (Arg) or 530 (Lys) of human plasminogen, which is in kringle 5 (see FIG. 16), which are known plasmin cleavage sites. Cleavage at this point would give a plasminogen fragment of about the molecular weight observed for native angiostatin on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions (50-60 kD).</p>The N-terminal sequence of human native angiostatin [SEQ ID NO:1] is given above in Example 1.
