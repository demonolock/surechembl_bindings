    "SK9 has been shown to play a role in cholesterol homeostasis by regulating apolipoprotein receptor secretion. It may also have a role in the differentiation of brain cortical neurons (Seidah et al., PNAS 100(3):928-933 (2003)).</p>The wild type PCSK9 gene contains 12 exons. The translated protein contains a signal peptide in the NH2-terminus, and in cells and tissues an about 74 kDa zymogen (precursor) form of the full-length protein is found in the endoplasmic reticulum. During initial processing in the cell, the about 14 kDa prodomain peptide is autocatalytically cleaved to yield a mature about 60 kDa protein containing the catalytic domain and a C-terminal domain often referred to as the cysteine-histidine rich domain (CHRD) (Figure 1). This about 60 kDa form of PCSK9 is secreted from liver cells. The secreted form of PCSK9 appears to be the physiologically active species, although an intracellular functional role of the about 60 kDa form has not been ruled out.</p>Several mutant forms of PCSK9 are known, including S127R, N157K, F216L, R218S, and D374Y, with S127R, F216L, and D374Y being linked to autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia (ADH). Benjannet et al. (J. Biol. Chem., 279(47):48865-48875 (2004)) demonstrated that the S127R and D374Y mutations result in a significant decrease in the level of pro-PCSK9 processed in the ER to form the active secreted zymogen. As a consequence it is believed that wild-type PCSK9 increases the turnover rate of the LDL receptor causing inhibition of LDL clearance (Maxwell et al., PNAS, 102(6):2069-2074 (2005); Benjannet et al., and Lalanne et al), while PCSK9 autosomal dominant mutations result in increased levels of LDLR, increased clearance of circulating LDL, and a corresponding decrease in plasma cholesterol levels (Rashid et al., PNAS, 102(15):5374-5379 (2005).</p>Lalanne et al. demonstrated that LDL catabolism was impaired and apolipoprotein B-containing lipoprotein synthesis was enhanced in two patients harboring S127R mutations in PCSK9 (J. Lipid Research, 46:1312-1319 (2005)). Sun et al. also provided evidence that mutant forms of PCSK9 are also the cause of unusually severe dominant hypercholesterolaemia as a consequence of its affect of increasing apolipoprotein B secretion (Sun et al, Hum. Mol. Genet., 14(9):1161-1169 (2005)). These results were consistent with earlier results which demonstrated adenovirus-mediated overexpression of PCSK9 in mice results in severe hypercholesteromia due to durastic decreases in the amount of LDL receptor Dubuc et al., Thromb. Vasc. Biol., 24:1454-1459 (2004), in addition to results demonstrating mutant forms of PCSK9 also reduce the level of LDL receptor (Park et al., J. Biol. Chem., 279:50630-50638 (2004). The overexpression of PCSK9 in cell lines, including liver-derived cells, and in livers of mice in vivo, results in a pronounced reduction in LDLR protein levels and LDLR functional activity without changes in LDLR mRNA level (Maxwell K.

In specific embodiments, antibodies of the present invention cross-react with murine, rat and/or rabbit homologues of human proteins and the corresponding epitopes thereof. Antibodies that do not bind polypeptides with less than 95%, less than 90%, less than 85%, less than 80%, less than 75%, less than 70%, less than 65%, less than 60%, less than 55%, and less than 50% identity (as calculated using methods known in the art and described herein) to a polypeptide of the present invention are also included in the present invention. In a specific embodiment, the above-described cross-reactivity is with respect to any single specific antigenic or immunogenic polypeptide, or combination(s) of 2, 3, 4, 5, or more of the specific antigenic and/or immunogenic polypeptides disclosed herein. Further included in the present invention are antibodies which bind polypeptides encoded by polynucleotides which hybridize to a polynucleotide of the present invention under stringent hybridization conditions (as described herein). Antibodies of the present invention may also be described or specified in terms of their binding affinity to a polypeptide of the invention. Preferred binding affinities include those with a dissociation constant or Kd less than 5 X 10-2 M, 10-2 M, 5 X 10-3 M, 10-3 M, 5 X 10-4 M, 10-4 M, 5 X 10-5 M, 10-5 M, 5 X 10-6 M, 10-6M, 5 X 10-7 M, 107 M, 5 X 10-8 M, 10-8 M, 5 X 10-9 M, 10-9 M, 5 X 10-10 M, 10-10 M, 5 X 10-11 M, 10-11 M, 5 X 10-12 M, 10-12 M, 5 X 10-13 M, 10-13 M, 5 X 10-14 M, 10-14 M, 5 X 10-15 M, or 10-15 M.</p>The invention also provides antibodies that competitively inhibit binding of an antibody to an epitope of the invention as determined by any method known in the art for determining competitive binding, for example, the immunoassays described herein. In preferred embodiments, the antibody competitively inhibits binding to the epitope by at least 95%, at least 90%, at least 85 %, at least 80%, at least 75%, at least 70%, at least 60%, or at least 50%.</p>Antibodies of the present invention may act as agonists or antagonists of the polypeptides of the present invention. For example, the present invention includes antibodies which disrupt the receptor/ligand interactions with the polypeptides of the invention either partially or fully. Preferably, antibodies of the present invention bind an antigenic epitope disclosed herein, or a portion thereof. The invention features both receptor-specific antibodies and ligand-specific antibodies. The invention also features receptor-specific antibodies which do not prevent ligand binding but prevent receptor activation. Receptor activation (i.e., signaling) may be determined by techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art. Fo",
    "ample, if the parental cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (\"HAT medium\"), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.</p>Preferred immortalized cell lines are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high level expression of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. More preferred immortalized cell lines are murine myeloma lines, which can be obtained, for instance, from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, California and the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Virginia. More preferred are the parent myeloma cell line (SP2O) as provided by the ATCC<sup>\u00ae</sup>. As inferred throughout the specification, human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor, J. Immunol., 133:3001 (1984); Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, (1987) pp. 51-63).</p>The culture medium in which the hybridoma cells are cultured can then be assayed for the presence of monoclonal antibodies directed against the polypeptides of the present invention. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by the hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assay (ELISA). Such techniques are known in the art and within the skill of the artisan. The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson and Pollart, Anal. Biochem., 107:220 (1980).</p>After the desired hybridoma cells are identified, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (Goding, supra, and/or according to Wands et al. (Gastroenterology 80:225-232 (1981)). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium and RPMI-1640. Alternatively, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites in a mammal.</p>The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones may be isolated or purified from the culture medium or ascites fluid by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-sepharose, hydroxyapatite chromatography, gel exclusion chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography.</p>The skilled artisan would acknowledge that a variety of methods exist in the art for the production of monoclonal antibodies and thus, the invention is not limited to their sole production in hydridomas. For example, the monoclonal antibodies may be made by recombinant DNA methods, such as those described in US patent No. 4,816,567</patcit>. In this context, the term \"monoclonal antibody\" refers to an",
    "t protocols see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York at 10.8.1.</p>ELISAs comprise preparing antigen, coating the well of a 96 well microtiter plate with the antigen, adding the antibody of interest conjugated to a detectable compound such as an enzymatic substrate (e.g., horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase) to the well and incubating for a period of time, and detecting the presence of the antigen. In ELISAs the antibody of interest does not have to be conjugated to a detectable compound; instead, a second antibody (which recognizes the antibody of interest) conjugated to a detectable compound may be added to the well. Further, instead of coating the well with the antigen, the antibody may be coated to the well. In this case, a second antibody conjugated to a detectable compound may be added following the addition of the antigen of interest to the coated well. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected as well as other variations of ELISAs known in the art. For further discussion regarding ELISAs see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York at 11.2.1.</p>The binding affinity of an antibody to an antigen and the off-rate of an antibody-antigen interaction can be determined by competitive binding assays. One example of a competitive binding assay is a radioimmunoassay comprising the incubation of labeled antigen (e.g., 3H or 125I) with the antibody of interest in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled antigen, and the detection of the antibody bound to the labeled antigen. The affinity of the antibody of interest for a particular antigen and the binding off-rates can be determined from the data by scatchard plot analysis. Competition with a second antibody can also be determined using radioimmunoassays. In this case, the antigen is incubated with antibody of interest conjugated to a labeled compound (e.g., 3H or 125I) in the presence of increasing amounts of an unlabeled second antibody.</p>Therapeutic Uses of AntibodiesThe present invention is further directed to antibody-based therapies which involve administering antibodies of the invention to an animal, preferably a mammal, and most preferably a human, patient for treating one or more of the disclosed diseases, disorders, or conditions. Therapeutic compounds of the invention include, but are not limited to, antibodies of the invention (including fragments, analogs and derivatives thereof as described herein) and nucleic acids encoding antibodies of the invention (including fragments, analogs and derivatives thereof and anti-idiotypic antibodies as described herein). The antibodies of the invention can be used to treat, inhibit or prevent diseases, disorders or conditions associated with aberrant expression and/or activity of a polypeptide of",
    "rposes without undue experimentation.</p>The antibodies of this invention may be advantageously utilized in combination with other monoclonal or chimeric antibodies, or with lymphokines or hematopoietic growth factors (such as, e.g., IL-2, IL-3 and IL-7), for example, which serve to increase the number or activity of effector cells which interact with the antibodies.</p>The antibodies of the invention may be administered alone or in combination with other types of treatments (e.g., radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy and anti-tumor agents). Generally, administration of products of a species origin or species reactivity (in the case of antibodies) that is the same species as that of the patient is preferred. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, human antibodies, fragments derivatives, analogs, or nucleic acids, are administered to a human patient for therapy or prophylaxis.</p>It is preferred to use high affinity and/or potent in vivo inhibiting and/or neutralizing antibodies against polypeptides or polynucleotides of the present invention, fragments or regions thereof, for both immunoassays directed to and therapy of disorders related to polynucleotides or polypeptides, including fragments thereof, of the present invention. Such antibodies, fragments, or regions, will preferably have an affinity for polynucleotides or polypeptides of the invention, including fragments thereof. Preferred binding affinities include those with a dissociation constant or Kd less than 5 X 10-2 M, 10-2 M, 5 X 10-3 M, 10-3 M, 5 X 10-4 M, 10-4 M, 5 X 10-5 M, 10-5 M, 5 X 10-6 M, 10-6 M, 5 X 10-7 M, 10-7 M, 5 X 10-8 M, 10-8 M, 5 X 10-9 M, 10-9 M, 5 X 10-10 M, 10-10 M, 5 X 10-11 M, 10-11 M, 5 X 10-12 M, 10-12 M, 5 X 10-13 M, 10- 13 M, 5 X 10-14 M, 10-14 M, 5 X 10-15 M, and 10-15 M.</p>Antibodies directed against polypeptides of the present invention are useful for inhibiting allergic reactions in animals. For example, by administering a therapeutically acceptable dose of an antibody, or antibodies, of the present invention, or a cocktail of the present antibodies, or in combination with other antibodies of varying sources, the animal may not elicit an allergic response to antigens.</p>Likewise, one could envision cloning the gene encoding an antibody directed against a polypeptide of the present invention, said polypeptide having the potential to elicit an allergic and/or immune response in an organism, and transforming the organism with said antibody gene such that it is expressed (e.g., constitutively, inducibly, etc.) in the organism. Thus, the organism would effectively become resistant to an allergic response resulting from the ingestion or presence of such an immune/allergic reactive polypeptide. Moreover, such a use of the antibodies of the present invention may have particular utility in preventing and/or ameliorating autoimmune diseases and/or disorders, as such conditions are typically a result of antibodies being directed against endogeno",
    "d Pittelkow and Scott, Mayo Clinic Proc. 61:771 (1986)).</p>In a specific embodiment, the nucleic acid to be introduced for purposes of gene therapy comprises an inducible promoter operably linked to the coding region, such that expression of the nucleic acid is controllable by controlling the presence or absence of the appropriate inducer of transcription.</p>Demonstration of Therapeutic or Prophylactic ActivityThe compounds or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are preferably tested in vitro, and then in vivo for the desired therapeutic or prophylactic activity, prior to use in humans. For example, in vitro assays to demonstrate the therapeutic or prophylactic utility of a compound or pharmaceutical composition include, the effect of a compound on a cell line or a patient tissue sample. The effect of the compound or composition on the cell line and/or tissue sample can be determined utilizing techniques known to those of skill in the art including, but not limited to, rosette formation assays and cell lysis assays. In accordance with the invention, in vitro assays which can be used to determine whether administration of a specific compound is indicated, include in vitro cell culture assays in which a patient tissue sample is grown in culture, and exposed to or otherwise administered a compound, and the effect of such compound upon the tissue sample is observed.</p>Therapeutic/Prophylactic Administration and CompositionsThe invention provides methods of treatment, inhibition and prophylaxis by administration to a subject of an effective amount of a compound or pharmaceutical composition of the invention, preferably an antibody of the invention. In a preferred aspect, the compound is substantially purified (e.g., substantially free from substances that limit its effect or produce undesired side-effects). The subject is preferably an animal, including but not limited to animals such as cows, pigs, horses, chickens, cats, dogs, etc., and is preferably a mammal, and most preferably human.</p>Formulations and methods of administration that can be employed when the compound comprises a nucleic acid or an immunoglobulin are described above; additional appropriate formulations and routes of administration can be selected from among those described herein below.</p>Various delivery systems are known and can be used to administer a compound of the invention, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, recombinant cells capable of expressing the compound, receptor-mediated endocytosis (see, e.g., Wu and Wu, J. Biol. Chem. 262:4429-4432 (1987)), construction of a nucleic acid as part of a retroviral or other vector, etc. Methods of introduction include but are not limited to intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, and oral routes. The compounds or compositions may be administered by any convenient route, for example by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epit",
    "th routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for intravenous administration to human beings. Typically, compositions for intravenous administration are solutions in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the composition may also include a solubilizing agent and a local anesthetic such as lignocaine to ease pain at the site of the injection. Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the composition is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the composition is administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration.</p>The compounds of the invention can be formulated as neutral or salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those formed with anions such as those derived from hydrochloric, phosphoric, acetic, oxalic, tartaric acids, etc., and those formed with cations such as those derived from sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, ferric hydroxides, isopropylamine, triethylamine, 2-ethylamino ethanol, histidine, procaine, etc.</p>The amount of the compound of the invention which will be effective in the treatment, inhibition and prevention of a disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression and/or activity of a polypeptide of the invention can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition, in vitro assays may optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration, and the seriousness of the disease or disorder, and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient's circumstances. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.</p>For antibodies, the dosage administered to a patient is typically 0.1 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg of the patient's body weight. Preferably, the dosage administered to a patient is between 0.1 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg of the patient's body weight, more preferably 1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg of the patient's body weight. Generally, human antibodies have a longer half-life within the human body than antibodies from other species due to the immune response to the foreign polypeptides. Thus, lower dosages of human antibodies and less frequent administration is often possible. Further, the dosage and frequency of administration of antibodies of the invention may be reduced by enhancing uptake and tissue penetration (e.g., into the brain) of the antibodies by modifications such as, for example, lipidation.</p>The invention also provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit c",
    "level of gene expression with a standard gene expression level, whereby an increase or decrease in the assayed polypeptide gene expression level compared to the standard expression level is indicative of a disorder. With respect to cancer, the presence of a relatively high amount of transcript in biopsied tissue from an individual may indicate a predisposition for the development of the disease, or may provide a means for detecting the disease prior to the appearance of actual clinical symptoms. A more definitive diagnosis of this type may allow health professionals to employ preventative measures or aggressive treatment earlier thereby preventing the development or further progression of the cancer.</p>Moreover, polypeptides of the present invention can be used to treat, prevent, and/or diagnose disease. For example, patients can be administered a polypeptide of the present invention in an effort to replace absent or decreased levels of the polypeptide (e.g., insulin), to supplement absent or decreased levels of a different polypeptide (e.g., hemoglobin S for hemoglobin B, SOD, catalase, DNA repair proteins), to inhibit the activity of a polypeptide (e.g., an oncogene or tumor suppressor), to activate the activity of a polypeptide (e.g., by binding to a receptor), to reduce the activity of a membrane bound receptor by competing with it for free ligand (e.g., soluble TNF receptors used in reducing inflammation), or to bring about a desired response (e.g., blood vessel growth inhibition, enhancement of the immune response to proliferative cells or tissues).</p>Similarly, antibodies directed to a polypeptide of the present invention can also be used to treat, prevent, and/or diagnose disease. For example, administration of an antibody directed to a polypeptide of the present invention can bind and reduce overproduction of the polypeptide. Similarly, administration of an antibody can activate the polypeptide, such as by binding to a polypeptide bound to a membrane (receptor).</p>At the very least, the polypeptides of the present invention can be used as molecular weight markers on SDS-PAGE gels or on molecular sieve gel filtration columns using methods well known to those of skill in the art. Polypeptides can also be used to raise antibodies, which in turn are used to measure protein expression from a recombinant cell, as a way of assessing transformation of the host cell. Moreover, the polypeptides of the present invention can be used to test the following biological activities.</p>Gene Therapy MethodsAnother aspect of the present invention is to gene therapy methods for treating or preventing disorders, diseases and conditions. The gene therapy methods relate to the introduction of nucleic acid (DNA, RNA and antisense DNA or RNA) sequences into an animal to achieve expression of a polypeptide of the present invention. This method requires a polynucleotide which codes for a polypeptide of the invention that operatively linked to a promoter and any ",
    "ntagonist of the present invention.</p>Binding ActivityA polypeptide of the present invention may be used to screen for molecules that bind to the polypeptide or for molecules to which the polypeptide binds. The binding of the polypeptide and the molecule may activate (agonist), increase, inhibit (antagonist), or decrease activity of the polypeptide or the molecule bound. Examples of such molecules include antibodies, oligonucleotides, proteins (e.g., receptors),or small molecules.</p>Preferably, the molecule is closely related to the natural ligand of the polypeptide, e.g., a fragment of the ligand, or a natural substrate, a ligand, a structural or functional mimetic. (See, Coligan et al., Current Protocols in Immunology 1(2):Chapter 5 (1991).) Similarly, the molecule can be closely related to the natural receptor to which the polypeptide binds, or at least, a fragment of the receptor capable of being bound by the polypeptide (e.g., active site). In either case, the molecule can be rationally designed using known techniques.</p>Preferably, the screening for these molecules involves producing appropriate cells which express the polypeptide, either as a secreted protein or on the cell membrane. Preferred cells include cells from mammals, yeast, Drosophila, or E. coli. Cells expressing the polypeptide (or cell membrane containing the expressed polypeptide) are then preferably contacted with a test compound potentially containing the molecule to observe binding, stimulation, or inhibition of activity of either the polypeptide or the molecule.</p>The assay may simply test binding of a candidate compound to the polypeptide, wherein binding is detected by a label, or in an assay involving competition with a labeled competitor. Further, the assay may test whether the candidate compound results in a signal generated by binding to the polypeptide.</p>Alternatively, the assay can be carried out using cell-free preparations, polypeptide/molecule affixed to a solid support, chemical libraries, or natural product mixtures. The assay may also simply comprise the steps of mixing a candidate compound with a solution containing a polypeptide, measuring polypeptide/molecule activity or binding, and comparing the polypeptide/molecule activity or binding to a standard.</p>Preferably, an ELISA assay can measure polypeptide level or activity in a sample (e.g., biological sample) using a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody. The antibody can measure polypeptide level or activity by either binding, directly or indirectly, to the polypeptide or by competing with the polypeptide for a substrate.</p>Additionally, the receptor to which a polypeptide of the invention binds can be identified by numerous methods known to those of skill in the art, for example, ligand panning and FACS<sup>\u00ae</sup> sorting (Coligan, et al., Current Protocols in Immun., 1(2), Chapter 5, (1991)). For example, expression cloning is employed wherein polyadenylated RNA is prepared from a cell responsive ",
    "modify the activities of the polypeptides of the present invention. Such a method would include contacting the polypeptide of the present invention with a selected compound(s) suspected of having antagonist or agonist activity, and assaying the activity of these polypeptides following binding.</p>This invention is particularly useful for screening therapeutic compounds by using the polypeptides of the present invention, or binding fragments thereof, in any of a variety of drug screening techniques. The polypeptide or fragment employed in such a test may be affixed to a solid support, expressed on a cell surface, free in solution, or located intracellularly. One method of drug screening utilizes eukaryotic or prokaryotic host cells which are stably transformed with recombinant nucleic acids expressing the polypeptide or fragment. Drugs are screened against such transformed cells in competitive binding assays. One may measure, for example, the formulation of complexes between the agent being tested and a polypeptide of the present invention.</p>Thus, the present invention provides methods of screening for drugs or any other agents which affect activities mediated by the polypeptides of the present invention. These methods comprise contacting such an agent with a polypeptide of the present invention or a fragment thereof and assaying for the presence of a complex between the agent and the polypeptide or a fragment thereof, by methods well known in the art. In such a competitive binding assay, the agents to screen are typically labeled. Following incubation, free agent is separated from that present in bound form, and the amount of free or uncomplexed label is a measure of the ability of a particular agent to bind to the polypeptides of the present invention.</p>Another technique for drug screening provides high throughput screening for compounds having suitable binding affinity to the polypeptides of the present invention, and is described in great detail in European Patent Application 84/03564, published on September 13, 1984</patcit>, which is incorporated herein by reference herein. Briefly stated, large numbers of different small peptide test compounds are synthesized on a solid substrate, such as plastic pins or some other surface. The peptide test compounds are reacted with polypeptides of the present invention and washed. Bound polypeptides are then detected by methods well known in the art. Purified polypeptides are coated directly onto plates for use in the aforementioned drug screening techniques. In addition, non-neutralizing antibodies may be used to capture the peptide and immobilize it on the solid support.</p>This invention also contemplates the use of competitive drug screening assays in which neutralizing antibodies capable of binding polypeptides of the present invention specifically compete with a test compound for binding to the polypeptides or fragments thereof. In this manner, the antibodies are used to detect the presence of a",
    "ism, processing, utilization, and storage of energy.</p>Polypeptide or polynucleotides and/or agonist or antagonists of the present invention may be used to change a mammal's mental state or physical state by influencing biorhythms, caricadic rhythms, depression (including depressive diseases, disorders, and/or conditions), tendency for violence, tolerance for pain, reproductive capabilities (preferably by Activin or Inhibin-like activity), hormonal or endocrine levels, appetite, libido, memory, stress, or other cognitive qualities.</p>Polypeptide or polynucleotides and/or agonist or antagonists of the present invention may also be used to prepare individuals for extraterrestrial travel, low gravity environments, prolonged exposure to extraterrestrial radiation levels, low oxygen levels, reduction of metabolic activity, exposure to extraterrestrial pathogens, etc. Such a use may be administered either prior to an extraterrestrial event, during an extraterrestrial event, or both. Moreover, such a use may result in a number of beneficial changes in the recipient, such as, for example, any one of the following, non-limiting, effects: an increased level of hematopoietic cells, particularly red blood cells which would aid the recipient in coping with low oxygen levels; an increased level of B-cells, T-cells, antigen presenting cells, and/or macrophages, which would aid the recipient in coping with exposure to extraterrestrial pathogens, for example; a temporary (i.e., reversible) inhibition of hematopoietic cell production which would aid the recipient in coping with exposure to extraterrestrial radiation levels; increase and/or stability of bone mass which would aid the recipient in coping with low gravity environments; and/or decreased metabolism which would effectively facilitate the recipients ability to prolong their extraterrestrial travel by any one of the following, non-limiting means: (i) aid the recipient by decreasing their basal daily energy requirements; (ii) effectively lower the level of oxidative and/or metabolic stress in recipient (i.e., to enable recipient to cope with increased extraterrestial radiation levels by decreasing the level of internal oxidative/metabolic damage acquired during normal basal energy requirements; and/or (iii) enabling recipient to subsist at a lower metabolic temperature (i.e., cryogenic, and/or sub-cryogenic environment).</p>Polypeptide or polynucleotides and/or agonist or antagonists of the present invention may also be used to increase the efficacy of a pharmaceutical composition, either directly or indirectly. Such a use may be administered in simultaneous conjunction with said pharmaceutical, or separately through either the same or different route of administration (e.g., intravenous for the polynucleotide or polypeptide of the present invention, and orally for the pharmaceutical, among others described herein.).</p>Polypeptide or polynucleotides and/or agonist or antagonists of the present invention ",
    "lar binding partner interaction can be identified.</p>In a particular embodiment, the PCSK9b or PCSK9c polypeptide can be prepared for immobilization using recombinant DNA techniques known in the art. For example, the PCSK9b or PCSK9c polypeptide coding region can be fused to a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) gene using a fusion vector such as pGEX-5X-1, in such a manner that its binding activity is maintained in the resulting fusion product. The interactive cellular or extracellular product can be purified and used to raise a monoclonal antibody, using methods routinely practiced in the art and described above. This antibody can be labeled with the radioactive isotope .sup.125 I, for example, by methods routinely practiced in the art. In a heterogeneous assay, e.g., the GST- PCSK9b or PCSK9c polypeptide fusion product can be anchored to glutathione-agarose beads. The interactive cellular or extracellular binding partner product can then be added in the presence or absence of the test compound in a manner that allows interaction and binding to occur. At the end of the reaction period, unbound material can be washed away, and the labeled monoclonal antibody can be added to the system and allowed to bind to the complexed components. The interaction between the PCSK9b or PCSK9c polypeptide and the interactive cellular or extracellular binding partner can be detected by measuring the amount of radioactivity that remains associated with the glutathione-agarose beads. A successful inhibition of the interaction by the test compound will result in a decrease in measured radioactivity.</p>Alternatively, the GST- PCSK9b or PCSK9c polypeptide fusion product and the interactive cellular or extracellular binding partner product can be mixed together in liquid in the absence of the solid glutathione-agarose beads. The test compound can be added either during or after the binding partners are allowed to interact. This mixture can then be added to the glutathione-agarose beads and unbound material is washed away. Again the extent of inhibition of the binding partner interaction can be detected by adding the labeled antibody and measuring the radioactivity associated with the beads.</p>In another embodiment of the invention, these same techniques can be employed using peptide fragments that correspond to the binding domains of the PCSK9b or PCSK9c polypeptide product and the interactive cellular or extracellular binding partner (in case where the binding partner is a product), in place of one or both of the full length products.</p>Any number of methods routinely practiced in the art can be used to identify and isolate the protein's binding site. These methods include, but are not limited to, mutagenesis of one of the genes encoding one of the products and screening for disruption of binding in a co-immunoprecipitation assay. Compensating mutations in the gene encoding the second species in the complex can be selected. Sequence analysis of the genes encoding the respective products will reveal the mutations that correspond to the region of the product involved in interactive binding. Alternatively, one product can be anchored to a solid surface using methods described in this Section above, and allowed to interact with and bind to its labeled binding partner, which has been treated with a proteolytic enzyme, such as trypsin. After washing, a short, labeled peptide comprising the binding domain can remain associated with the solid material, which can be isolated and identified by amino acid sequencing. Als",
    "rin sequence) or exogenously (e.g., post secretion, post purification, post production, etc.). The preferred sequence of each feature of the fusion protein construct, from the 5' to 3' direction with each feature being operably linked to the other, would be a promoter, signal sequence, \"X\" number of (CAD)x domains, the furin sequence (or other proteolytic sequence), and the coding sequence of the polypeptide of the present invention. The artisan would appreciate that the promotor and signal sequence, independent from the other, could be either the endogenous promotor or signal sequence of a polypeptide of the present invention, or alternatively, could be a heterologous signal sequence and promotor.</p>The specific methods described herein for controlling protein secretion levels through controlled ER aggregation are not meant to be limiting are would be generally applicable to any of the polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention, including variants, homologues, orthologs, and fragments therein.</p>EXAMPLE 17 - ALTERATION OF PROTEIN GLYCOSYLATION SITES TO ENHANCE CHARACTERISTICS OF POLYPEPTIDES OF THE INVENTIONMany eukaryotic cell surface and proteins are post-translationally processed to incorporate N-linked and O-linked carbohydrates (Kornfeld and Kornfeld (1985) Annu. Rev. Biochem. 54:631-64; Rademacher et al., (1988) Annu. Rev. Biochem. 57:785-838). Protein glycosylation is thought to serve a variety of functions including: augmentation of protein folding, inhibition of protein aggregation, regulation of intracellular trafficking to organelles, increasing resistance to proteolysis, modulation of protein antigenicity, and mediation of intercellular adhesion (Fieldler and Simons (1995) Cell, 81:309-312; Helenius (1994) Mol. Biol. Of the Cell 5:253-265; Olden et al., (1978) Cell, 13:461-473; Caton et al., (1982) Cell, 37:417-427; Alexamnder and Elder (1984), Science, 226:1328-1330; and Flack et al., (1994), J. Biol. Chem., 269:14015-14020). In higher organisms, the nature and extent of glycosylation can markedly affect the circulating half-life and bio-availability of proteins by mechanisms involving receptor mediated uptake and clearance (Ashwell and Morrell, (1974), Adv. Enzymol., 41:99-128; Ashwell and Harford (1982), Ann. Rev. Biochem., 51:531-54). Receptor systems have been identified that are thought to play a major role in the clearance of serum proteins through recognition of various carbohydrate structures on the glycoproteins (Stockert (1995), Physiol. Rev., 75:591-609; Kery et al., (1992), Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 298:49-55). Thus, production strategies resulting in incomplete attachment of terminal sialic acid residues might provide a means of shortening the bioavailability and half-life of glycoproteins. Conversely, expression strategies resulting in saturation of terminal sialic acid attachment sites might lengthen protein bioavailability and half-life.</p>In the development of recombinant glycoproteins for use as ph",
    "HROUGH MOLECULAR EVOLUTIONAlthough many of the most biologically active proteins known are highly effective for their specified function in an organism, they often possess characteristics that make them undesirable for transgenic, therapeutic, and/or industrial applications. Among these traits, a short physiological half-life is the most prominent problem, and is present either at the level of the protein, or the level of the proteins mRNA. The ability to extend the half-life, for example, would be particularly important for a proteins use in gene therapy, transgenic animal production, the bioprocess production and purification of the protein, and use of the protein as a chemical modulator among others. Therefore, there is a need to identify novel variants of isolated proteins possessing characteristics which enhance their application as a therapeutic for treating diseases of animal origin, in addition to the proteins applicability to common industrial and pharmaceutical applications.</p>Thus, one aspect of the present invention relates to the ability to enhance specific characteristics of invention through directed molecular evolution. Such an enhancement may, in a non-limiting example, benefit the inventions utility as an essential component in a kit, the inventions physical attributes such as its solubility, structure, or codon optimization, the inventions specific biological activity; including any associated enzymatic activity, the proteins enzyme kinetics, the proteins Ki, Kcat, Km, Vmax, Kd, protein-protein activity, protein-DNA binding activity, antagonist/inhibitory activity (including direct or indirect interaction), agonist activity (including direct or indirect interaction), the proteins antigenicity (e.g., where it would be desirable to either increase or decrease the antigenic potential of the protein), the immunogenicity of the protein, the ability of the protein to form dimers, trimers, or multimers with either itself or other proteins, the antigenic efficacy of the invention, including its subsequent use a preventative treatment for disease or disease states, or as an effector for targeting diseased genes. Moreover, the ability to enhance specific characteristics of a protein may also be applicable to changing the characterized activity of an enzyme to an activity completely unrelated to its initially characterized activity. Other desirable enhancements of the invention would be specific to each individual protein, and would thus be well known in the art and contemplated by the present invention.</p>Directed evolution is comprised of several steps. The first step is to establish a library of variants for the gene or protein of interest. The most important step is to then select for those variants that entail the activity you wish to identify. The design of the screen is essential since your screen should be selective enough to eliminate non-useful variants, but not so stringent as to eliminate all variants. The last step is then to repeat the above "
