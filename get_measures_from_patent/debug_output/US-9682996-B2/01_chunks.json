For example, the screening assay may be performed by (1) contacting the mimetics of a library with a biological target of interest, such as a receptor, to allow binding between the mimetics of the library and the target to occur, and (2) detecting the binding event by an appropriate assay, such as the calorimetric assay disclosed by Lam, et al. (Nature 354:82-84, 1991) or Graminski, et al. (Biotechnology 12:1008-1011, 1994)(both of which are incorporated herein by reference). In a preferred embodiment, the library members are in solution and the target is immobilized on a solid phase. Alternatively, the library may be immobilized on a solid phase and may be probed by contacting it with the target in solution.</p>A method for carrying out a binding assay also can be applied as follows. The method can include providing a composition that includes a first co-activator, an interacting protein, and a test compound. The amino acid structure of the first co-activator includes a binding motif of LXXLL, LXXLI, or FxxFF wherein X is any amino acid. The method further includes detecting an alteration in binding between the first co-activator and the interacting protein due to the presence of the compound, and then characterizing the test compound in terms of its effect on the binding. The assay may be carried out by any means that can measure the effect of a test compound on the binding between two proteins. Many such assays are known in the art and can be utilized in the method of the present invention, including the so-called Two-Hybrid and Split-Hybrid systems. The Two-Hybrid system, and various means to carry out an assay using this system, are described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,410,245. The Split-Hybrid system has been described by, e.g., Hsiu-Ming Shih, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 93:13896-13901, November 1996; and John D. Crispino, et al., Molecular Cell, 3:1-20, February 1999. In the Split-Hybrid system, a fusion protein is utilized where protein X is fused to the lexA DNA binding domains (pLexA) and protein Y is fused to the transcription activator VP16 (pSHM.1-LacZ). Interaction between lexA-X and VP16-Y leads to the expression of the Tetracycline repressor protein (TetR). TetR prevents transcription of",
    "pound useful in inhibiting survivin expression may be identified, and the effects of a particular compound of the present invention may be characterized, by appropriate methods known in the art, as described in detail above.</p>Compounds of the present invention also may inhibit the expression of survivin. Blanc-Brude et al., Nat. Medicine 8:987 (2002), have shown that survivin is a critical regulator of smooth muscle cell apoptosis which is important in pathological vessel-wall remodeling. Accordingly, another aspect of the present invention provides a method of treating or preventing restenosis associated with angioplasty comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a safe and effective amount of an alpha-helix mimetic of the present invention. In one embodiment the invention treats the restenosis, i.e., administration of an alpha-helix mimetic of the present invention to a subject having restenosis achieves a reduction in the severity, extent, or degree, etc. of the restenosis. In another embodiment the invention prevents the restenosis, i.e., administration of an alpha-helix mimetic of the present invention to a subject that is anticipated to develop new or additional restenosis achieves a reduction in the anticipated severity, extent, or degree, etc. of the restenosis. Optionally, the subject is a mammalian subject.</p>Compounds of the present invention also may inhibit TCF/\u03b2-catenin transcription. Rodova et al., J. Biol. Chem. 277:29577 (2002), have shown that PKD-1 promoter is a target of the TCF/\u03b2-catenin pathway. Accordingly, another aspect of the present invention provides a method of treating or preventing polycystic kidney disease comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a safe and effective amount of an alpha-helix mimetic of the present invention. In one embodiment the invention treats the polycystic kidney disease, i.e., administration of an alpha-helix mimetic of the present invention to a subject having polycystic kidney disease achieves a reduction in the severity, extent, or degree, etc. of the polycystic kidney disease. In another embodiment the invention prevents polycystic kidney disease, i.e., administration of an alpha-helix mimetic of the present invention to a subject that is anticipated to develop new or additional polycystic kidney disease achieves a reduction in the anticipated severity, extent, or degree, etc. of the polycystic kidney disease. Optionally, the subject is a mammalian subject.</p>Compounds of the present invention also may inhibit the expression of Wnt signaling. Hanai et al., J. Cell Bio. 158:529 (2002), have shown that endostatin, a known anti-angiogenic factor, inhibitWnt signaling. Accordingly, another aspect of the present invention provides a method of treating or preventing aberrant angiogenesis disease comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a safe and effective amount of an alpha-helix mimetic of the present invention.

    " \u03b2-catenin suggests that the Wnt pathway is continuously stimulated in lung diseases such as IPF and that inhibitors of Wnt signaling may provide a means to control this proliferation. Increased nuclear \u03b2-catenin was detected in the mesenchyme adjacent to the airway epithelium, described as myofibroblasts. (Chilosi, 2003.) These myofibroblastscan induce apoptosis in neighboring epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo, probably through degradation of the extracellular matrix. (Uhal, B. D., et al., Am. J. Physiol. 275:L1192-L1199, 1998; Uhal, B. D., et al., Am. J. Physiol. 269:L819-L828, 1995; Selman, M., et al., Am. J. Physiol. 279:L562-L574, 2000.) In addition, in IPF there appears to be either a lack of re-epithelialization or an increase in type 2 cells with little if any maturation of type 1 cells, leading to injured areas with exposed mesodermal components or re-epithelialized with immature type 2 cells. Since it has been demonstrated that type 2 cells express high levels of TGF-\u03b21, which is a profibrotic cytokine, in IPF either scenario would inhibit the proper re-epithelialization of these injured areas, causing more fibrosis. (Kapanci, Y., et al., Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 152:2163-2169, 1995; Khalil, N., et al., Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 5: 155-162, 1991.) This process could go unchecked and eventually lead to massive changes in tissue architecture, eventual tissue destruction, and loss of lung function.</p>Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a 36 to 38 kD cysteine-rich peptide containing 349 amino acids. It belongs to the CCN (CTGF, cyr 61/cef 10, nov) family of growth factors. The gene for CTGF was originally cloned from a human umbilical endothelial cell cDNA library. CTGF has been detected in endothelial cells, fibroblasts, cartilaginous cells, smooth muscle cells, and some cancer cell lines. Earlier studies revealed that TGF-\u03b21 increases CTGF mRNA markedly in human foreskin fibroblasts. PDGF, EGF, and FGF were also shown to induce CTGF expression, but their effects were only transient and weak.</p>Connective tissue growth factor has diverse bioactivities. Depending on cell types, CTGF was shown to trigger mitogenesis, chemotaxis, ECM production, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. In earlier studies, CTGF was noted to have mitogenic and chemotactic effects on fibroblasts. CTGF was also reported to enhance the mRNA expression of a1(I) collagen, fibronectin, and as integrin in fibroblasts. The finding that TGF-\u03b2 increases CTGF synthesis and that TGF-\u03b2 and CTGF share many functions is consistent with the hypothesis that CTGF is a downstream mediator of TGF-\u03b2.</p>The mechanism by which CTGF exerts its effects on cells, especially its signal transduction, is still unclear. CTGF was reported to bind to the surface of fibroblasts with high affinity, and this binding was competed with recombinant PDGF BB. This suggests that CTGF binds to a certain class of PDGF receptors, or that there is some cross reactivity of PDGF BB with CTGF rec"
