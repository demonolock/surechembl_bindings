In certain embodiments, the MG53 inhibitor is capable of reducing extracellular free MG53 activity by at least 5%, 10%, 20%, 40%, 50%, 80%, 90%, 95% or more.</p>In this application, \"activity\" when used in conjunction with an increase or decrease refers to a detected functional activity, which may be manifested as a change in the level of extracellular free MG53, or a constant level but a change in functional activity.

    "ion is performed according to the grouping situation. Subsequently, 1 injection was given at 9 points at 1 mg/injection volume of 0.24 ml/injection. The mice were then fasted and blood glucose was measured at 15 and 19 days of the experiment. And body weight was measured at 9 points, and blood glucose was measured at 9 and 15 points, respectively, on the following day for 10 consecutive days.</p>Insulin resistance experiments (ITT) were carried out on day 8 after injection, under conditions described in Song et al, Central role of E3 biquitin lipid MG53 in insulin resistance and metabolic disorders, Nature, 494, 375-.</p>The detection results are shown in fig. 11. From the experimental results, it is known that the MG53 antibody is effective in lowering blood glucose and improving insulin sensitivity, and thus can be used for treating diabetes.</p>Example 4: research on MG53 small-molecule inhibitor</p>All small molecule compounds used in example 4 were purchased from the SPECS library of compounds in the netherlands, and MG53 protein was synthetically prepared by orignee.</p>Computer virtual screening</p>Firstly carrying out homologous modeling on MG53 protein, selecting an existing protein structure with a higher protein primary structure, namely amino acid sequence homology and higher resolved structure resolution as a reference structure, then predicting a small molecule binding pocket by using Cavity 2.0, and selecting a pocket with relatively large pocket volume, large dissociation constant (pKD) and amphipathy as a target pocket.</p>The principle of screening is to screen in different ways at different angles, each screening method scores according to the combination strength of small molecule compounds and proteins, and selects molecules with higher scores each time, and finally selects the intersection of the screening results of different methods. The specific operation is as follows: firstly, fixing each group in a protein pocket, using small molecular compounds to carry out free butt joint, and selecting twenty thousand compounds with high scores; then, enabling small molecular compounds and groups to be in free rotary butt joint, and selecting four thousand compounds with high scores; manual screening was then performed using pymol software, with the following five criteria: a. the molecular weight of the compound is more than 300Da, and the specific response becomes weaker when the molecular weight is too small; b. there are at least three hydrogen bond interactions between the compound and groups in the pocket in order to increase the interaction between the compound and the protein; c. the occupancy rate of the compound on the protein pocket is more than 80 percent, which is also used for reducing non-specificity; d. the compound cannot be a polypeptide, in order to avoid non-specific binding of the polypeptide in the body; e. the compound does not contain a metal atom. Finally, 140 small molecule compounds are obtained.</p>Cell screening</p>These 140 m",
    "/528 nm. Compounds were screened at 100. mu.M, 10. mu.M and 1. mu.M, respectively. A total of 48 candidate compound molecules were screened.</p>SPR screening</p>These 48 candidate compound molecules were subjected to a preliminary screening of SPR experiments. According to theoretical calculation, the theoretical response value of the mutual combination between the MG53 protein and the small molecule compound is 5, so that one of the criteria for screening is that the response value is greater than or equal to 5. We selected two concentrations, 50. mu.M and 100. mu.M for screening, and the control was PBS solution. As shown in FIG. 13, 15 molecules in total among the 48 small molecule compounds have response values of not less than 5 (among them, the responses of No. 10, No. 14, No. 16, No. 17, No. 25, No. 68, No. 13, No. 16 and No. 28 are relatively high; and the responses of No. 1, No. 3, No. 26, No. 28, No. 56 and No. 10 are relatively low), and these compounds are candidate molecules for the next screening.</p>Next, the kinetics of binding of these 15 candidate molecules to MG53 were explored by concentration-dependent SPR experiments. The screening criteria included dissociation constants of less than 50 \u03bc M, non-specific binding, high molecular purity, and final screening of 4 candidate molecules (data see FIG. 14, 1, 10, 26 and 16, respectively). The dissociation constants of the 4 molecules are less than 50 mu M (see the corresponding S-shaped curve on the right, the dissociation constant is the concentration of the compound when the response value reaches half of the maximum response value), the lowest response concentration is very small and reaches the nanomolar level, which indicates that the higher the specificity of the compound for binding with MG53 protein, the better the drug potency is, and the corresponding kinetic curves are the S-shaped curves, which indicates that the 4 molecules of the compound have better kinetic characteristics. The other 11 compound molecules were either too pure (detected by small molecule mass spectrometry), too large in dissociation constant (dissociation constant above 50 \u03bc M), or exhibited poor kinetic characteristics (the kinetic curve was linear or not sigmoidal, indicating that the molecule was strongly non-specific for MG53 protein binding), and so on. Of the 4 candidate molecules, the 26 th molecule, which is worth mentioning, has the lowest response concentration of only 1.2nM and the dissociation constant of 100nM, which indicates that the molecule has very good specific binding to MG53 protein, and the SPR response curve is of the \"slow-up-slow-down\" type, which indicates that if it is used for drug administration treatment, it will show the advantages of small dosage, long drug effect, stable drug effect, and long drug administration time interval, thus having great drug formation possibility.</p>Verification of degradation experiment</p>Next, the intracellular activities of the 4 candidate molecules were further verified. HEK293T cells in good culture were divided into 6 groups, and transfected IRS1 and MG53-myc, 4 groups of IRS1 and MG53-myc transfected cells were treated with 50. mu.M of compound, and total cell protein was extracted 24 hours after adding the compound and subjected to SDS-PAGE gel vertical electrophoresis. Expression of IRS1 and MG53 proteins were detected at the time of exposure, and GAPDH was used as an internal control. We found that these 4 compound molecules all have a certain degree of recovery effect on MG 53-mediated ubiquitination degradation of IRS1 (see fig. 15), which indicates that these compound molecules have a certain degree of inhibition effect on MG53 functioning as its E3 ligase in cells.</p>The structures of the 4 compounds screened are as follows:</p></p></p>sequence listing</p>&lt;110&gt; Beijing university</p>&lt;120&gt; method and use for detecting or inhibiting extracellular free MG53</p>&lt;130&gt;  066467-8"
