    "ting the second culture media from step (iv) as conditioned media. The filtration membranes used herein may be selected from any of those known in the art having a suitable membrane and configuration, such that they are capable of retaining the desired MSC secretome components while allowing the cell particulate and/or other detrimental components pass through. Thus, one may employ any suitable membrane which permits the retention of cells under the fluid dynamic conditions selected whilst allowing the detrimental components to pass through for removal. In some embodiments, an upper limit of pore size of about 5 microns and a lower limit of about 0.1 microns would be suitable. In some embodiments, filtration can be performed using a micropore filter. In some embodiments, filtration can be performed using a 0.5 \u03bcm to a 0.2 \u03bcm filter. In some embodiments, filtration can be performed using a 0.5 \u03bcm, 0.45 \u03bcm, 0.4 \u03bcm, 0.35 \u03bcm, 0.3 \u03bcm, 0.25 \u03bcm, 0.22 \u03bcm and/or a 0.2 \u03bcm filter. In some embodiments, filtration can be performed using a 0.45 \u03bcm filter. In some embodiments, filtration can be performed using a 0.22 \u03bcm filter. In some embodiments, filtration/purification can be performed using a low protein binding polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. In some embodiments, filtration/purification can be performed using polyethersulfone (PES).</p>In some embodiments, the filtering is by ultra-filtration. In some embodiments, the conditioned medium is filtered using a filter size of 3 kD (to achieve purification, desalting, and concentration in the processed conditioned medium of molecules larger than the filter size). In some embodiments, a filter size of less than 3 kD is used to filter the conditioned medium, while in other embodiments a filter size of greater than 3 kD is used, depending on the application for which the processed conditioned medium is used. In other embodiments, ultra-filtration of harvested conditioned medium is carried out using a filter of a different pore size (e.g., 2 kD, &lt;2 kD or &gt;2 kD) selected to determine the size of components of the resulting processed conditioned medium comprising the MSC secretome.</p>In some embodiments, the detrimental components in the growth supporting media are removed by medium exchange, preferably via \u201ccross-flow filtration\u201d. Cross-flow filtration refers to a mode of filtration where a suspension of MSC secretome cells flows substantially parallel to a filter which is permeable to a component of the suspension other than cells. The cross-flow filtration process is characterized by a set of fluid dynamic parameters including Re=Reynolds number, \u03b3w=wall shear rate, \u0394P=pressure drop and TMP=transmembrane pressure. Re, \u03b3w and \u0394P will depend on the geometry of the filtration system, flow conditions and fluid properties. Such cross-flow processes can, in some embodiments, include hollow fiber filtration systems as well. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,053,334, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>In some embodiments, the FN composition can be further subject to concentrated in the absence of filtration and/or after filtration. In some embodiments, the FN composition can be concentrated using hollow fiber tangential flow technology.</p>In some embodiments, the FN composition can be concentrated using centrifugation based size exclusion technique, for example, amicons and/or centricons can be employed during the centration step. In some embodiments, the size cutoff is a 3-10 kDa MW cutoff. In some embodiments, the"
