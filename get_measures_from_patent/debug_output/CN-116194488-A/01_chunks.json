The expression control sequence is operably linked to the nucleic acid sequence to be transcribed. </p>As used herein, a \"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\" or \"pharmaceutically acceptable excipient\" comprises any material that, when combined with an active ingredient, allows the ingredient to retain biological activity and be non-reactive with the subject's immune system. Examples include, but are not limited to, any standard pharmaceutical carrier, such as phosphate buffered saline, water, emulsions such as oil/water emulsions, and various types of wetting agents. Exemplary diluents for aerosol or parenteral administration include Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) or normal (0.9%) saline. Compositions comprising such carriers are formulated by well known conventional methods (see, e.g., remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18 th edition, edited by a. Gennaro, mark Publishing co., easton, PA., 1990, 21 st edition mark Publishing company, 2005, of Remington pharmaceutical science and practice (Remington, the Science and Practice of Pharmacy)).</p>As used herein, the term \"k <sub>on</sub> \"refers to the rate constant at which the scFv of an antibody or CAR associates with an antigen.</p>As used herein, the term \"k  <sub>off</sub> \"refers to the rate constant at which the scFv of an antibody or CAR dissociates from the antibody/antigen complex.</p>As used herein, the term \"K <sub>D</sub> \"refers to the equilibrium dissociation constant of an antibody-antigen interaction or scFv-antigen interaction.</p>Reference herein to \"about\" one value or parameter includes (and describes) embodiments directed to that value or parameter itself. For example, a description referring to \"about X\" includes a description of \"X\". The numerical range includes the numbers defining the range.</p>It should be understood that when embodiments are described herein wherever the language \"comprising,\" otherwise similar embodiments described in terms of \"consisting of \u2026\" and/or \"consisting essentially of \u2026\" are also provided.</p>Where aspects or embodiments of the invention are described in terms of Markush groups or other alternative groupings, the invention encompasses not only the entire group listed as a whole, but also all possible sub-groups of each member and main group of the group individually, as well as main groups lacking one or more of the group members. The present invention also contemplates the explicit exclusion of one or more of any of the group members in the claimed invention. </p>Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. In case of conflict, the present specification, including definitions, will control.

    "acid residues, one or more deletions or additions of amino acids, or the use of chemical analogs that do not significantly deleteriously alter the functional activity or affinity maturation (enhancement) of the polypeptide to its ligand.</p>Amino acid sequence insertions include amino and/or carboxy-terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing one hundred or more residues, as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include antibodies with an N-terminal methionyl residue or antibodies fused to an epitope tag. Other insertional variants of antibody molecules include fusions to the N-or C-terminus of an antibody to an enzyme or polypeptide that increase the half-life of the antibody in the blood circulation. </p>Substitution variants remove at least one amino acid residue in the antibody molecule and insert a different residue in its position. The most interesting sites for substitution mutagenesis comprise hypervariable regions, but FR alterations are also envisaged. Conservative substitutions are shown in table 4 under the heading \"conservative substitutions\". If such substitutions result in a change in biological activity, more substantial changes, designated as \"exemplary substitutions\" in Table 4 or as described further below with respect to amino acid groups, can be introduced and the products screened.</p>Table 2: amino acid substitutions</p></p></p>The binding affinity (KD) of a recombinant antigen receptor of the invention, e.g., a ligand binding domain of a CAR of the invention, as described herein, to its target antigen, e.g., DLL3 (e.g., human DLL 3), can be, e.g., about 0.1 to about 1000nM, e.g., between about 0.5nM to about 500nM, or, e.g., between about 1nM to about 250 nM. In some embodiments, the binding affinity is about any one of the following: 1000nM, 750nM, 500nM, 400nM, 300nM, 250nM, 200nM, 100nM, 90nM, 80nM, 70nM, 60nM, 50nM, 45nM, 40nM, 35nM, 30nM, 25nM, 20nM, 19nM, 18nM, 17nM, 16nM, 15nM, 10nM, 8nM, 7.5nM, 7nM, 6.5nM, 6nM, 5.5nM, 5nM, 4nM, 3nM, 2nM, 1nM, 0.5nM, 0.3nM or 0.1nM. </p>In some embodiments, the scFv of the ligand binding domain of a recombinant antigen receptor as described herein binds with its target antigen, e.g., DLL3 (K <sub>D</sub> ) Is about 10nM to about 100nM, about 10nM to about 90nM, about 10nM to about 80nM, about 20nM to about 70nM, about 25nM to about 75nM, or about 40nM to about 110nM.
