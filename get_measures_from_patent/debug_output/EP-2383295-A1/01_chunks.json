The values were determined by extension of the dissociation curves to get to the time required for the 50% reduction of the Y-axis of the dissociation sensogram.

Human MIG, human IP-10 and mouse IP-10 were obtained commercially (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ), whereas rhesus monkey IP-10 was made by recombinant expression and purified by standard methods. The antigens were conjugated to the CM5 sensor chip @ 140 RUs (rhesus monkey IP-10), 457 RUs (human MIG), 206 RUs (human ITAC) and 150 RUs (mouse IP-10). Association sensograms were obtained by flowing antibodies in HBS EP buffer at a concentration of 133 nM for 5 minutes. The flow was then stopped and dissociation was monitored for 5 minutes. The association and dissociation curves were fit to a Langmuir binding model using BIAevaluation software (Biacore AB).

Twenty-five microliters of <sup>125</sup>I-IP-10 (Amersham, Cat. #IM332-25\u00b5Ci) at increasing concentrations was added, followed by 25 \u00b5l of cells at a density of 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells per well. The plates were incubated on a plate shaker for 60 minutes at room temperature and washed three times with wash buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.5% BSA) at a volume of 200 \u00b5l per wash. The plates were dried, 25 \u00b5l of scintillant was added and the plates were counted on a Wallac Microbeta Counter. Data were analyzed using Prism software and a K<sub>D</sub> was calculated. A mean K<sub>D</sub> of 0.231 nM was determined for receptor binding.</p>Next, the ability of the anti-IP-10 antibodies to inhibit the binding of 100 pM - <sup>125</sup>I-hIP-10 to the CXCR3-expressing cells was examined. Competition assays were run in a similar manner to the experiment described above. Briefly, 25 \u00b5l of binding buffer was added to the glass fiber filter plates, followed by 25 \u00b5l of increasing concentrations of anti-IP-10 antibodies. Twenty-five microliters of <sup>125</sup>I-IP-10 was added to a final concentration of 0.100 nM.

To prepare the PBLs, normal human blood was purified by standard Ficoll separation. The purified human PBLs were stimulated by adding the cells to plates coated with 3 \u00b5g/ml of anti-CD3 antibody and grown in RPMI with 10% FBS. Following a three day incubation, the cells were maintained in growth media containing 500 U/ml of IL-2.
