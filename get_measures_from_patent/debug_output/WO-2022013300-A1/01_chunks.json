    "n the molecule replaced by a different residue. The sites of greatest interest for substitution mutagenesis of antibodies include the hypervariable regions. </p>The term \u201cspecifically binds\u201d, \"specific binding\" or \u201cspecifically recognizes\u201d, when used in the present invention to refer to the binding of an antibody or a fragment thereof to the interleukin 11 receptor alpha subunit (IL11 RA) extracellular domain, is understood as the capacity of the antibody or fragment thereof to bind specifically to the IL11 RA extracellular domain by means of the existence of complementarity between the three- dimensional structures of the two molecules with a substantially higher affinity for non specific binding such that the binding between said antibody or fragment thereof and the IL11 RA extracellular domain preferably takes place before the binding of any of said molecules with respect to the other molecules present in the reaction mixture. This results in that the antibody or fragment thereof does not cross-react with other molecules. Cross-reactivity of the antibody or fragment thereof may be tested, for example, by assessing binding of said antibody or fragment thereof under conventional conditions to the protein of interest as well as to a number of more or less (structurally and/or \n\nfunctionally) closely related proteins. For instance, a binding can be considered specific if the binding affinity between the antibody and the IL11RA extracellular domain has a dissociation constant (KD) of less than 10<sup>6</sup> M, less than 10<sup>7</sup> M, less than 10<sup>8</sup> M, less than 10<sup>9</sup> M, less than 10<sup>10</sup> M, less than 10<sup>11</sup> M, less than 10<sup>12</sup> M, less than 10<sup>13</sup> M, less than 10<sup>14</sup> M or less than 10<sup>15</sup> M. </p>The capacity of the antibody or antibody fragment as described herein, to bind to the IL11 RA extracellular domain can be determined by a number of assays that are well known in the art. Preferably, the binding capacity of the binding agents is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA), enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA), surface plasmon resonance or by immunofluorescent techniques such as immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry. </p>The term \u201cinterleukin 11 receptor alpha subunit (IL11RA)\u201d refers to a human gene which codes for the subunit of the interleukin 11 receptor. Interleukin 11 is a stromal cell-derived cytokine that belongs to a family of pleiotropic and redundant cytokines that use the gp130 transducing subunit in their high affinity receptors. This gene encodes the IL-11 receptor, which is a member of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor family. This particular receptor is very similar to ciliary neurotrophic factor, since both contain an extracellular region with a 2-domain structure composed of an immunoglobulin-like domain and a cytokine receptor-like domain. Alternative splicing has been observed at this locus and two variants, each encoding a distinct isoform, have been identified. The human gene is shown in the Ensembl database under accession number ENSG00000137070 (Ensembl release 100, April 2020). </p>The term \u201cextracellular domain\u201d refers to the part of the receptor which protrudes from the outer membrane of the cell organelles and cells. </p>The antibody of the invention comprises; a heavy chain variable region (VH) wherein the CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 of the VH comprise respectively the sequences of SEQ ID NO: 1, 2 and 3 or functionally equivalent variants",
    "eutic target </p>After verifying that the antibody had a neutralizing effect in-vitro, PDX57 model which expressed IL-11 and its receptor but did not exhibit a high baseline activation of the JAK/STAT pathway, was chosen to perform the in-vivo treatment (Figure 3). The model used maintained the histology of the adenocarcinoma of origin. Treatments on the selected model were performed based on a mouse with grown tumors which were extracted for the subcutaneous implantation of fragments in both flanks of 18 athymic mice. When these tumors reached a volume of 200 mm<sup>3</sup>, the animals were distributed into 3 groups of 5 animals: a control group, to which only vehicle was administered, a group treated with anti-IL-11 RA (300 pg/mouse), and a third group treated with anti-GST (glutathione-S-transferase) antibody (300 pg/mouse) as specificity control. Treatment was performed intraperitoneally, and 3 doses were administered every week for 3 weeks (Figure 4B). The tumors were measured every 5 days with a precision caliper and the size of each tumor was normalized with the size it had on the day the treatment started. As a result of the treatment, it was observed that the IL-11 RA neutralizing antibody significantly reduced the size of the tumors (Figure 3C). IHC staining showed that treatment with the anti-IL-11RA neutralizing antibody reduced STAT3 protein activation and the expression of cyclin D1 and Ki67 proliferation proteins (Figure 3D). </p>This result confirms that the inhibition of the IL-11 pathway could be a suitable therapeutic strategy for lung adenocarcinoma tumors with high levels of this protein. \n</p>"
