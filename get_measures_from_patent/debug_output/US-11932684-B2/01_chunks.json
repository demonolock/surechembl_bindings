    "e. Alternatively or additionally, an antibody fragment may be wholly or partially synthetically produced. An antibody fragment may optionally comprise a single chain antibody fragment. Alternatively or additionally, an antibody fragment may comprise multiple chains that are linked together, for example, by disulfide linkages. An antibody fragment may optionally comprise a multi-molecular complex.</p>The term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d as used herein is not limited to antibodies produced through hybridoma technology. A monoclonal antibody can be derived from a single clone, including any eukaryotic, prokaryotic, or phage clone, by any means available or known in the art. Monoclonal antibodies useful with the present disclosure can be prepared using a wide variety of techniques known in the art including the use of hybridoma, recombinant, and phage display technologies, or a combination thereof.</p>As used herein, the term \u201cantibody-drug conjugate\u201d or \u201cADC\u201d can refer to antibody attached to biologically active drug(s) by linker(s) with labile bond(s). An ADC can comprise several molecules of a biologically active drug (or the payload) which can be covalently linked to side chains of amino acid residues of an antibody (Siler Panowski et al., Site-specific antibody drug conjugates for cancer therapy, 6 MABS 34-45 (2013)). An antibody used for an ADC can be capable of binding with sufficient affinity for selective accumulation and durable retention at a target site. Most ADCs can have Kd values in the nanomolar range. The payload can have potency in the nanomolar/picomolar range and can be capable of reaching intracellular concentrations achievable following distribution of the ADC into target tissue. Finally, the linker that forms the connection between the payload and the antibody can be capable of being sufficiently stable in circulation to take advantage of the pharmacokinetic properties of the antibody moiety (i.e., long half-life) and to allow the payload to remain attached to the antibody as it distributes into tissues, yet should allow for efficient release of the biologically active drug d once the ADC is taken up into target cells.</p>The linker can be: those that are non-cleavable during cellular processing and those that are cleavable once the ADC has reached the target site. With non-cleavable linkers, the biologically active drug released within the call includes the payload and all elements of the linker still attached to an amino acid residue of the antibody, typically a lysine or cysteine residue, following complete proteolytic degradation of the ADC within the lysosome. Cleavable linkers are those whose structure includes a site of cleavage between the payload and the amino acid attachment site on the antibody. Cleavage mechanisms can include hydrolysis of acid-labile bonds in acidic intracellular compartments, enzymatic cleavage of amide or ester bonds by an intracellular protease or esterase, and reductive cleavage of disulfide bonds by"
