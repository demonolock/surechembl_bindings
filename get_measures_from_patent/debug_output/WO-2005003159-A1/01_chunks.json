    " PBS was used as a running buffer. The fractions were examined for recombinant protein by Western blotting and subsequent immuno- printing. For partial purification, 2 ml supernatant of the transient expression were loaded onto a 1 ml EconoPac-column (Biorad, Munich, Germany) using a Tris-buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5) . The same buffer with 500 mM NaCI added thereto was used for elution. The fractions were also examined for protein content and dialysed against PBS . For control purposes, the identic procedure was employed with the supernatant of non-transfected cells.</p>\n  1.2.5 Purification and detection of proteins using the Strep-tag system</p>\n  1.2.5.1 The Strep-tag system</p>\n  For purification and immobilization of the recombinant proteins, CVF, C3 and the hybrids consisting of CVF and C3 were supplied with a Strep-tag-fusion peptide. The Strep-tag is a synthetic peptide consisting of 9 amino acids (AWRHPQFGG) , which binds to streptavidin with an affinity of 2.7xl0<sup>4</sup> (Schmidt et al . , 1996). It uses the binding pocket for biotin. As C-terminal fusion partner for proteins, it can be used for purification and detection. An N-terminal fusion is also possible since the system has been improved. The resulting Strep-tagll (WSHPQFEK) binds with a lower affinity to Streptavidin (Schmidt et al . , 1996), however, a derivate was found by a selection round with randomly mutated Streptavidin, which in turn has a sufficient high affinity (Skerra and Schmidt, 2000) . \n\nWith a dissociation constant of 1 \u03bcM, the agarose-immobilized Strepta- vidin-derivate Strep-Tactin can be used for purification. Strep- tactin-conjugates or anti-Strep-tagll antibodies can be utilized for detection in immunoprinting or in ELISA analysis.</p>\n  1.2.5.2 Detection of strep-tag fusionproteins</p>\n  For detection of strep-tagll-fusionproteins in supernatant of transient expression, an ELISA was conducted. For this purpose, 3 \u03bcg strep-tactin (diluted in 40 \u03bcl incubation solution) were immobilized overnight at 4\u00b0C on the surface on the wells of an ELISA plate (Gre- iner, Frickenhausen, Gemany) . Subsequently, the procedure described above in connection with the ELISA was performed.</p>\n  1.2.6 Purification of hydrid H5</p>\n  Supernatant (500 ml) obtained from stably transfected cells was adjusted to pH 7.5, passed trough a 0.45 \u03bcm cellulose acetate membrane and loaded onto a Poros HQ/M anion exchange column equilibrated with 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5 using AKTA purifier (Amersham Bioscience, Freiburg, Germany) . The recombinant protein was eluted using a linear (0-500 mM) NaCI gradient. Fractions (2 ml) were analyzed using 7.5% SDS-PAGE and western blotting, pooled and dialyzed against phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The pooled sample was diluted (1:9) in 50 mM sodium phosphate, 0.55 M sodium sulfate buffer, pH 7.0, filtered (0.2 \u03bcm) and applied to a thiophilic resin (1.5 ml, BD Bioscience, Heidelberg, Germany) equilibrated with 50 mM sodium phosphate, 0.5 M sodium sulfate buffe",
    " \u03bcl of this dilution were introduced into each of the 48 - 96 wells of the 96 well plates (Greiner Labortechnik, Frickenhausen, Germany) . After approximately one week, the medium was removed, and 100 \u03bcl medium with 10 % FCS were added. After approximately 2 weeks, the wells were examined under the microscope for one colony per well . \n\nSome were selected, and the cells were detached with 25 \u03bcl trypsine for 5 min at 37\u00b0C and completely transferred into the well of a 24- well-plate (Greiner Labortechnik, Frickenhausen, Germany) , which was completely filled with 500 \u03bcl medium containing 10 % FCS. After one week, this precedure was repeated with 100 \u03bcl trypsine, and all cells were placed into a well of a 6-wellplate. After another 3 to 4 days, 100 \u03bcl supernatant per well were taken and examined by Western blotting and subsequent i muno printing. The cell population, which finally showed the strongest band, was further expressed under selection pressure and cryoconserved, if applicable.</p>\n  EXAMPLE II</p>\n  Concept and establishment of a solid phase assay (cf . Example I, 1.2.8.4)</p>\n  The assay comprises immobilizing the hybrids as Strep-tagll fusion proteins to Strep-Tactin, which is bound to the surface of ELISA plates . The subsequent addition of buffer and serum should facilitate the conduction of the complement-consumption-assays in the ELISA plate .</p>\n  For immobilization, a Strep-tagll was selected, which is a peptide consisting of 8 amino acids (WSHPQFEK) . With a dissociation constant of 1 \u03bcM to Strep-Tactin, the Strep-tag is suitable for directed immobilization as well as for protein purification and detection purposes.</p>\n  Fusion of an affinity tag to CVF and C3</p>\n  The presence of the affinity tag is essential for the performance of the developed solid-phase-assay. The proteins which shall be analyzed need a fusion tag; therefore, an enterokinase-cleavage site was inserted into the cDNA of CVF and C3 between the signal sequence and the N-terminus of the Strep-tagll which allows the cleavage of the affinity tags lateron. \n\nUsing the CVF-cDNA two amplification products were generated in two PCR reactions using the oligonucleotides S35 and AS26 and the oligonucleotides S23 and AS34. The amplification products were hybridized using PCR. The amplification product was digested using the restriction enzymes Kpnl and Eco72I and ligated into a pcDNA3CVF-vector which was digested analogously. The cDNA of human C3 was treated in an analogous manner. Using the oligonucleotides SOI and AS36 and S37 and AS03, amplification products were generated and hybridized. For insertion, the restriction sites Notl and Bpull02l were used.</p>\n  Alternatively, His tags were used as affinity tags, which - in analogy to the Strep-tags - were inserted between the signal sequence and the N-terminus .</p>\n  Briefly, for H6, two amplification products were generated using St- hC3 with the oligonucleotides SOI and AS61 and with the oligonucleotides S62 and AS03"
