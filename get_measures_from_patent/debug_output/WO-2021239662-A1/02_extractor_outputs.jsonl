Rmax was determined at the end of the experiment by adding 200mM 3-isobutyl-l-methylxanthine (IBMX), a pan-PDE inhibitor, in the presence of 2.5mM forskolin.\ncAMP production in response to 2.5mM forskolin is increased in PI3Ky-KO compared to WT primary VSMC by 2.2 folds (24.09% vs 52.57% of IBMX response, p=0.03), while forskolin response of PI3Ky-KD cells remains similar to WT (Figure 2A-C).\nThe results showed that cAMP levels are mostly regulated by PDE4 in WT and PI3Ky-KD cells (67% and 73% respectively relatively to the IBMX response).\nPDE3 implication in cAMP levels regulation in these cells is limited to 25% and 17% of IBMX response, respectively (Figure 3A, B and C).\nAccordingly, in PI3Ky-KO cells the major PDE isoform degrading cAMP is PDE3 (49 % of IBMX response for PDE3 vs 43% of IBMX response for PDE4, Figure 2C).\nPDE4D activity was significantly reduced in PI3Ky-KO cells compared to WT and RI3Kg-K\u038c (Figure 3D and E).\nAn adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin (FSK), was supplemented to culture media to increase cAMP levels and counterbalance the VSMC proliferation induced by PDGF (Figure 1C).\nThe inventors' results showed that 25 mM of FSK decreased VSMC proliferation and showed that FSK effect is significantly potentiated in the absence of RI3Kg (RI3Kg-KO) but not in RI3Kg-K\u038c VSMC, confirming the role of AKAP function of RI3Kg in VSMC (Figures ID and E)."}
