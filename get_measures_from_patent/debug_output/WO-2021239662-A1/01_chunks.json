    " key role of non-hematopoietic \n\nphosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma (PI3Ky) in the vascular wall during intimal hyperplasia using mouse models deleted for PI3Ky or expressing a Kinase Dead version of the enzyme. Moreover, the inventors found that absence of RI3Kg in VSMC leads to a modulation of cell proliferation linked to an increase in intracellular cAMP levels. Real time analysis of cAMP dynamics reveals that RI3Kg modulates the degradation of cAMP independently of its kinase activity in primary VSMC through the regulation of phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 enzymes. The present invention thus concerns the therapeutic application of the N-terminal competing peptide of RI3Kg (having the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID No.: 1) or a corresponding homolog that is able to block primary VSMC proliferation. These data provide evidence for a kinase-independent role of RI3Kg in arterial remodeling and reveal novel strategies targeting the docking function of RI3Kg for the treatment/prevention/delay of onset of fibroproliferative vascular diseases. </p>Brief description of the drawings </p>The invention will now be described in detail, purely by way of an illustrative and non-limiting example and, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein : </p>Figure 1: RI3Kg controls IH and VSMC proliferation </p>A.

Schematic model of RI3Kg implication in VSMC proliferation. VSMC proliferation is induced by PDGF stimulation. Inventors' previous results, represented in gray, demonstrate that autocrine secretion of MCP1 recruits and activates RI3Kg through GPCR signaling to control cell migration after PDGF stimulation [13]. This RI3Kg recruitment could also concentrate phosphodiesterases (PDE) that counterbalance cAMP production by adenylate cyclase (AC) induced by other signals. By these mechanisms, RI3Kg acts as an amplifier of VSMC synthetic transition. </p>Figure 6: Amino acid sequences of peptides having the ability to penetrate a cell membrane. </p>Detailed description of the invention \n\n In the description that follows, numerous specific details are given to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments.

    "nses and IH, the specific involvement of each of these two cell types was explored in models of PI3KY dependent IH [24]. In this second study, Yu et al. first confirm that the kinase activity of RI3Kg is involved in IH in response to vascular injury. In their model they corroborate that both pharmacological inhibition and genetic knockdown of RI3Kg reduce IH. They report that reduction of the catalytic activity of RI3Kg blocks phosphorylation and activation of Akt. In line with this effect, they also demonstrate that Akt- mediated phosphorylation of CREB as well as CREB- dependent transcriptional activation of YAP are determined by the catalytic activity of RI3Kg. In addition, to address the question of the specific cell type involved in this process, they show that specific downregulation of RI3Kg in either leukocytes or vascular tissue concur to the protection against IH development in response to vascular injury [24]. All these studies converge on the catalytic activity of RI3Kg and fail to explore whether the scaffold function of this protein and cAMP levels are involved. </p>On the contrary, data presented herein clearly demonstrate that the kinase independent function of RI3Kg affects proliferation of VSMC through a direct, cell-autonomous mechanism. The present data conclusively discriminate between a kinase-dependent and a kinase- \n\nindependent role of PI3Ky in vivo through the study of mice genetically engineered to express a kinase-dead version of the enzyme (PI3Ky-KD mice) that retains the ability to interact with PKA [19]. The present results with PI3Ky-KD mice clearly demonstrated that loss of the catalytic activity in the hematopoietic compartment led to a small reduction of IH. Conversely, loss of the RI3Kg catalytic activity in the non-hematopoietic compartment was not able to block IH. In line with a role of the protein-protein interaction between RI3Kg and PKA, complete loss of RI3Kg in KO mice led to a strong in vivo reduction of IH. As a further prove of the involvement of the docking function of RI3Kg in the control of VSMC proliferation, a peptide specifically targeting the scaffold but not the catalytic activity of RI3Kg (KIT2014) inhibits VSMC proliferation in vitro. In line with this view, the ability of KIT2014 to block VSMC proliferation acts independently of RI3Kg catalytic activity and confirms that the two roles of the enzyme can be independently targeted. </p>In summary, the present results are consistent with an unprecedented role for KIT2014 in disrupting the RI3Kg/RKA complex promoting the PDE4D-dependent cAMP suppression required to maintain VSMC proliferation. On this basis, the inventors' findings point to a non- obvious use of KIT2014 in the treatment of IH, occurring in disease like restenosis, atherosclerosis and pulmonary arterial hypertension. KIT2014 can be used as a component of medicated stents or local treatments concomitant with angioplasty for the treatment of atherosclerosis and restenosis, or as an inhaled agent for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. </p>Results </p>Inventors' previous results identified a role of \n\nthe catalytic activity of PI3Ky in immune processes of IH development and arterial healing [26]. This was demonstrated by using knock-in mice expressing a catalytically inactive RI3Kg (RI3Kg-K\u038c) subjected to arterial mechanical injury. RI3Kg KD mice showed reduced arterial occlusion and accumulation of monocytes and T cells around sites of vascular lesion. In the present study the inventors intended to further explore the implication of RI3Kg in the vascular compartment, and to evaluate a possible role of its non-catalytical and docking function in IH. Bone marrow [27] chimeras were generated using RI3Kg-KO and RI3Kg-K\u038c mice as recipients, to discriminate between kinase-dependent or kinase-independent function of RI3Kg in the vascular compartment. The inventors introduced BM from WT into PI3Kg-KO (WTXKO) or RI3Kg-K\u038c (WT&gt;KD) animals and vice versa (KO&gt;WT and KD&gt;WT). After engraftment, femoral arteries were injured, and lesions were analyzed 28 days later. In BM WT&gt;KO and KO&gt;KO chimeras, the intima/media ratio was decreased by 40% compared to BM WT&gt;WT chimera (Figure 1A), whereas no difference was observed in BM WT&gt;KD chimeras as previously observed [26]. These results indicated that the presence of RI3Kg, and not its catalytic activity, is required in the vascular compartment to induce a fibroproliferative response to the injury. </p>Consistently with the inventors' previous results [26], BM KO&gt;WT, BM KD&gt;WT or BM KD&gt;KD chimeras showed a large decrease in intima/media ratio confirming the role of RI3Kg catalytic activity in the immune compartment (Figure 1A). Histological analysis by Masson Trichrome staining of the injured arteries showed a decreased neointima area in BM WT&gt;KO and BM KO&gt;WT chimeras compared to controls (Figure 1A). This staining clearly indicated that the reduced neointima area in BM WT&gt;KO is mostly \n\ndue to a lower expansion of the VSMC layer (Figure 1A). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the post injury VSMC proliferation is independent from the catalytic function of the PI3Ky but rather involves its docking function. </p>Given the importance of cAMP in the inhibition of VSMC proliferation in vitro and in vivo [3-5], the inventors hypothesized that a kinase-independent function of PI3Ky could also be implicated in VSMC proliferation via cAMP regulation. To test this hypothesis, the proliferation of primary VSMC from different genotypes (WT, RI3Kg-KO or RI3Kg-K\u038c) was evaluated by stimulation with a powerful mitogenic agent for VSMC, platelet derived growth factor (PDGF). An adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin (FSK), was supplemented to culture media to increase cAMP levels and counterbalance the VSMC proliferation induced by PDGF (Figure 1C). The inventors' results showed that 25 mM of FSK decreased VSMC proliferation and showed that FSK effect is significantly potentiated in the absence of RI3Kg (RI3Kg-KO) but not in RI3Kg-K\u038c VSMC, confirming the role of AKAP function of RI3Kg in VSMC (Figures ID and E). These results demonstrated that RI3Kg controls VSMC proliferation by regulating intracellular concentration of cAMP, independently from its enzymatic activity. </p>The involvement of the RI3Kg in controlling intracellular concentration of cAMP in VSMC was confirmed by studying the dynamic of cAMP signals in WT, RI3Kg-K\u03cb or RI3Kg-KO primary VSMC using the FRET-based <sup>T</sup>Epac<sup>w</sup> biosensor [28]. Relative changes in cAMP levels in response to 2.5 mM forskolin were monitored over time, by calculating the ratio of donor fluorescence (F480nm) to acceptor fluorescence (F535nm). cAMP level is determined as a percentage of the maximum ratio change \n\n (Rmax). Rmax was determined at the end of the experiment by adding 200mM 3-isobutyl-l-methylxanthine (IBMX), a pan-PDE inhibitor, in the presence of 2.5mM forskolin. As shown in figure 2, cAMP production in response to 2.5mM forskolin is increased in PI3Ky-KO compared to WT primary VSMC by 2.2 folds (24.09% vs 52.57% of IBMX response, p=0.03), while forskolin response of PI3Ky-KD cells remains similar to WT (Figure 2A-C). cAMP basal levels were not altered at steady states in all three genotypes (Figure 2A and B). Moreover, the maximum ratio change was also identical in VSMC from all genotypes (Figure 2A). Altogether, these results showed that the cAMP response to forskolin is higher in PI3Ky-KO VSMC than in WT and PI3Ky-KD cells, demonstrating a role for RI3Kg in cAMP level limitation. </p>The intracellular level of cAMP depends on its production and degradation by adenylyl cyclases (AC) and PDE, respectively. RI3Kg has already been shown to bind PDE in cardiomyocytes [11, 19], and among these the inventors focused on PDE3 and 4 since they have been implicated in IH [8, 10, 29]. They successively treated forskolin-stimulated VSMC with cilostamide and rolipram, inhibiting PDE3 and PDE4 respectively, and quantified cAMP level according to the Rmax. These experiments allowed to evaluate the relative proportion of cAMP pools regulated by each PDE in different genotypes. The results showed that cAMP levels are mostly regulated by PDE4 in WT and PI3Ky-KD cells (67% and 73% respectively relatively to the IBMX response). PDE3 implication in cAMP levels regulation in these cells is limited to 25% and 17% of IBMX response, respectively (Figure 3A, B and C). Accordingly, in PI3Ky-KO cells the major PDE isoform degrading cAMP is PDE3 (49 % of IBMX response for PDE3 vs 43% of IBMX response for PDE4, Figure 2C). To confirm the implication of PDE4 enzymes in cAMP regulation \n\ndownstream of PI3Ky, the inventors performed immunoprecipitation and measured PDE4 activity. They focused on PDE4D which is the main isoform expressed in VSMC. Consistent with inventors' cAMP measurements in living cells, PDE4D activity was significantly reduced in PI3Ky-KO cells compared to WT and RI3Kg-K\u038c (Figure 3D and E). </p>RI3Kg has been shown to regulate cAMP levels and signaling via its AKAP function in cardiomyocytes [19]. Interestingly, the interaction between RI3Kg and the PKA/PDE complex has been mapped to the N-terminal region of r\u0390\u0390qg between amino acid 126 and 150 [19]. To further investigate the functional relationship between RI3Kg, cAMP regulation by PKA/PDE and VSMC proliferation, the inventors disrupted the RI3Kg/RKA interaction by treating the cells with a cell penetrating competing peptide corresponding to the binding region of PKA on r\u0390\u0390qg, and probed for their proliferation in response to PDGF and forskolin [19]. A control peptide has been designed with two-point mutations (K&gt;A and R&gt;A at position 1 and 5 of the RI3Kg sequence, respectively) that does not interact with PKA [19] (Figure 4A). First, the inventors assessed the ability of the peptide to selectively interfere with the scaffold and not the catalytic function of RI3Kg. They found that C5a- mediated Akt phosphorylation in macrophages, an event relying on the catalytic activity of RI3Kg [30], was unaltered in cells treated with the RI3Kg peptide, while significantly reduced in those exposed to the canonical RI3Kg kinase inhibitor AS-6052540 (Figure 4B). Next, they determined the time course of peptide penetration in VSMC using a FITC-tagged version of the peptide. The peptide was detectable in cells after 5 hours and was still detectable 30h after incubation (Figure 4C-D). Thus, the inventors used the RI3Kg peptide to block \n\nRI3Kg-RKA interaction in an experiment of cell proliferation as in figure ID. Incubation with the blocking peptide inhibited cell proliferation in WT and PI3Ky-KD cells (Figure 5A and B) whereas no difference was observed in PI3Ky-KO cells (Figure 5C). These data clearly demonstrate that RI3Kg controls VSMC proliferation via its AKAP function. </p>Altogether, the present results allow to conclude that RI3Kg acts as a catalyst of VSMC proliferation by decreasing cAMP levels mainly through the direct control of PDE4 enzymes (Figure 5D). </p>Methods </p>Animals: PI3Ky-deficient (RI3Kg-KO) mice and mice expressing a catalytically inactive form of RI3Kg (RI3Kg kinase-dead mice; PI3Ky-KD) were from a C57BL/6J background and have been described earlier [31-33]. WT, PI3Ky-KD, PI3Ky-KO were maintained at the animal facility of Rangueil (UMS 06; Anexplo platform) and kept under SPF conditions. All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines on Animal Experimentation and were under a French Ministry of Agriculture license. </p>Femoral artery wire injury in mice : WT, PI3Ky-KD, PI3Ky-KO male mice aged 8-10 week were investigated using an established model of femoral artery wire injury [27], for IH studies. In brief, general anesthesia was achieved with 2% isoflurane. Then, the femoral artery was isolated, and an incision was made under a surgical microscope (Carl Zeiss). A 0.35-mm diameter angioplasty guide wire with a 0.25-mm tip was advanced three times into the artery up to the level of the aortic bifurcation then pulled back. After removal of the wire, the arteriotomy site was ligated. Mice were sacrificed 28 days after the injury for histological and \n\nimmunohistochemical analysis. </p>Tissue processing and morphometry: IH quantification was performed by the paraffin-embedment technique. At the point of euthanasia, mice were perfused with PBS, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Vessels were harvested and fixed in 4% formalin, pH = 8, for 24 h. They were put into paraffin and prepared as slides (4- pm-thick sections). To quantify the rate of IH, sections were stained with Masson Trichrome (Bio Optica), and then the lumen, IEL (internal elastic lamina), and EEL (external elastic lamina) perimeters (pm) were measured at 4 sections (0.5, 2.0, 3.5, and 5 mm from the ligation site) for each vessel using LAS software (Leica). Arteries that underwent an occlusive thrombotic event were excluded from the quantification group. The area defined by the EEL (pm<sup>2</sup>) was calculated assuming circular geometry in vivo: (A<sub>EEL</sub> = EEL circumference<sup>2</sup> \u00f7 4n). The area defined by the IEL (pm<sup>2</sup>) was calculated using: (A<sub>IEL</sub>= IEL circumference<sup>2</sup>\u00f7 4n). The lumen area (pm<sup>2</sup>) was calculated using: (A<sub>LUM</sub> = Lumen circumference<sup>2</sup>\u00f7 4n). The neointimal area (pm<sup>2</sup>) was calculated using: (A<sub>NE0</sub> = A<sub>IEL</sub> - A<sub>lum</sub>)\u00b7 The medial area (pm<sup>2</sup>) was calculated using: (A<sub>MED</sub> = A<sub>EEL</sub> - A<sub>IEL</sub>). The intima/media ratio was calculated using: (neointima/media = A<sub>NE0</sub> \u00f7 A<sub>MED</sub>)\u00b7 </p>Bone Marrow (BM) transplantation: BM was obtained from 8-week-old WT, PI3Ky-KD and PI3Ky-KO mice. BM cells were flushed from femurs and tibias, then washed, filtered, counted, and resuspended in sterile PBS for retro-orbital injection of 10<sup>7</sup> unfractionated cells per WT, PI3Ky-KD or RI3Kg-KO irradiated mouse (9 Gy; Gilardoni RadGil irradiator). 4 weeks later, femoral artery injury was performed, and mice were euthanized 28 d after the surgery. The successful engraftment was confirmed by PCR. </p>Isolation of SMC from murine aorta and culture: \n\nMouse VSMCs were isolated from WT mice according to a modified protocol described by [34]. In brief, aorta from 4 WT mice were dissected from their origin to the iliac bifurcation, flushed with PBS, and removed. The adventitia was removed from the aorta and the smooth tubes were cut into pieces of 1-2 mm, and then digested in 0.3% collagenase solution. Collagenase digestion was stopped by adding DMEM (D0822, Sigma Aldrich) /10% FBS (FBS, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Then, the pieces of aorta were washed twice and seeded in culture dishes. Primary confluent cultures were trypsinized (0.1% trypsin; Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37\u00b0C, and then cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 in DMEM/10% FBS and cultured until the fourth passage. </p>Measure of mouse SMC proliferation: Primary mouse SMCs were sub-cultured onto 48-well cell culture plates in complete medium. Cells were treated or not with PDGF (520-BB-050, R&amp;D Systems) and forskolin (F3917, Sigma Aldrich) for 24h. For blocking peptide experiments, cells were incubated 24h with 25 mM of control (RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKKGAATHASPGQIHLVQRHPPSEESQAF - SEQ ID No.: 13) or blocking peptide (RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKKGKATHRSPGQIHLVQRHPPSEESQAF - SEQ ID No.: 14) .
