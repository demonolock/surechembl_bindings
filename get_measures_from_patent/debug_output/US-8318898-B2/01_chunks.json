    "ored by a spectrofluorometer instrument at excitation and emission wavelengths of 370 nm/460 nm. For measurement of K<sub>i(app) </sub>values, the inhibitor concentrations were varied over a range wide enough to yield residual activities of 25-75% of the control value.</p>These experiments showed that that furin activity is inhibited by the specific furin inhibitor Decanoyl (d) -RVKR-chloromethylketone (CMK) (CALBIOCHEM) (FIG. 4A). In addition, the chelators EDTA and EGTA effectively suppressed furin activity. These results are consistent with other data showing that furin is Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent cellular endoprotease.</p>Many of the synthetic peptides described herein (see e.g., FIG. 1, SEQ ID NO. 1 TO SEQ ID NO. 23) are potent PC inhibitors and exhibit greater specificity to furin. As demonstrated in FIG. 4B the basic peptides including D-9Rac/am (SEQ ID NO. 15), D-6R (SEQ ID NO. 19), and L-Bel1 (SEQ ID NO. 3) inhibited to completion in vitro furin activity (K<sub>i </sub>in nM) when compared against Boc-RVRR-MCA as substrate. D-9Rac/am (SEQ ID NO. 15) appears to be more effective inhibitor than all the peptides tested (FIG. 5). Thus while 0.7 \u03bcM of D-9Rac/am is sufficient to fully block the cleavage of Boc-RVRR-CMA by furin (FIG. 5A), L-Bel1 and L-9K required a higher amount (3.5 \u03bcM and &gt;3.5 \u03bcM respectively) for complete blockade of this cleavage (FIGS. 5B and 5C). D-9Rac/am showed a K<sub>i(app)</sub>=170 nM compared to K<sub>i(app)</sub>=370 nM for L-Bel1 and to Ki=1 nM for FI-I (CALBIOCHEM). Thus, D-9Rac/am is the strongest furin inhibitor tested in these conditions.</p>Example 6Basic peptides Inhibit Intracellular Furin ActivityExperiments described above showed that certain synthetic peptides could effectively inhibit furin activity in an enzyme-substrate assay. However, it is useful to determine if the peptides have the same effect on furin activity in a cellular environment, by assaying activity in PC12-ES cells which express furin.</p>To monitor the intracellular furin activity, 80% confluent PC12-ES cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS1\u00d7) by centrifugation at 800\u00d7g for 5 minutes at 4\u00b0 C., resuspended in 100 mM HEPES, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5% TritonX-100, and 1 mM 2-\u03b2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5, sonicated 6 times at 4\u00b0 C. for 10 seconds, and then centrifuged at 8000\u00d7g for 20 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. The protein concentration in the samples was determined using a bicinchonic acid protein assay kit (Pierce Chemical Co.).</p>Intracellular furin activity was measured with a furin-specific fluorogenic substrate, t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc)-RVKR-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (MCA). Briefly, the cell lysate (20 \u03bcg-60 \u03bcg of protein) prepared as described above was incubated with 100 \u03bcM Boc-RVRR-MCA in a 96-well flat-bottom black plate for at least 6 hours at room temperature and fluorescence measured by excitation at 365 nm and emission at 450 nm.</p>Furin activity was constitutively detected in PC12-ES cells (FIG. 4).
