    "to HGFR and ADCC activity. Therefore, they can specifically bind to a cancer cell expressing HGFR then exhibits the ADCC activity so as to damage a cancer cell. The target cancer cell by the drug of this embodiment is not particularly limited, but it can target, for example, pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells.</p>The present invention furthermore provides a method of reducing the grade of malignancy of a target cell or promoting the normalization by damaging or suppressing the expression of HER1, HER2, CD46, ITGA3, ICAM1, ALCAM, or CD147 in the target cell.</p>Herein, the present inventors have investigated and recognized specific expression of CD46 in gallbladder and liver cancer and pancreas cancer, which had not been particularly reported about the relationship with respect to CD46 (see the below-mentioned Example). Similarly, the relationship between gallbladder and liver cancer and pancreas cancer and the expression of ITGA3; the relationship between kidney cancer, hepatic cell carcinoma and gallbladder and liver cancer and ALCAM; as well as the relationship between kidney cancer and CD147 have been clarified (see the below-mentioned Example). Based on the findings, a novel and effective target cell of CD46 is a gallbladder and liver cancer cell and a pancreas cancer cell; a novel and effective target cell of ITGA3 is a gallbladder and liver cancer cell and a pancreas cancer cell; and a novel and effective target cell of CD 147 is a kidney cancer cell.</p>Note here that the inhibition or suppression of each antigen can be carried out by using an antisense method or RNA interference, or by using ribozyme.</p>In the case where expression inhibition by the antisense method is carried out, for example, when transcription is carried out in the target cell, an antisense-construct for generating RNA that is complementary to a portion specific to mRNA encoding this protein is used. Such an antisense - construct is introduced into the target cells, for example, in a form of an expression plasmid. On the other hand, when it is introduced in to the target cells as the antisense - construct, it is possible to employ an oligonucleotide - probe that is hybridized with mRNA or genome DNA sequence encoding this protein and inhibits the expression thereof. As such an oligonucleotide - probe, one having a low resistance to endogenous nuclease such as exonuclease and/or endonuclease is preferably used.</p>When DNA molecule is used as an antisense nucleic acid, it is preferable that oligodeoxyribonucleotide derived from a region (for example, a region from -10 to +10) including a translation initiation site of mRNA encoding this protein is used.</p>It is preferable that the complementation between the antisense nucleic acid and the target nucleic acid is strict. However, some mismatch may be accepted. The hybridization performance of the antisense nucleic acid with respect to the target nucleic acid is generally dependent upon both the degree of complementation of both nucleic acids and the length thereof. In general, as the antisense nucleic acid to be used is longer, even if the number of mismatch is increased, stable two he",
    " at 37\u00b0C for 48 hours, cells were washed with PBS (10 mL), treated with 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA (Sigma T4049) (750 \u00b5L), \u03b1MEM (5 mL) was added. Then, cultured product was peeled off and recovered from the plate. The number of cells was measured. Based on the results, limiting dilution was carried out under the conditions of 10 cells / 200\u00b5L/well (two sheets of 96 well plates). After culturing for 14 days, ELISA was carried out by using a culture supernatant of each well and the expression of an IgG type antibody was confirmed.</p>12-3 Purification of expression protein (IgG) from culture supernatantProtein G Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (amersham pharmacia biotech: 17-0618-01) (1 mL) was packed in a column and balanced in PBS (5 mL). The culture supernatant was applied, sent at the flow rate of 1 drop /2 seconds, and allowed the expressed protein (IgG) to be bonded to a column. PBS (10 mL) was sent at the flow rate of 1 drop /2 seconds, non-adsorbed components were washed, then 6 mL of elute buffer (0.2M glycine-HCl, pH 3) was sent at the flow rate of 1 drop /second, and 1 mL each of eluate was collected in a 1.5 ml tube. To the collection tube, neutralizing buffer (3M Tris-HCl) (400 \u00b5L) was added in advance. Neutralization was carried out at the same time of collection. The eluate was collected and concentrated to 750 \u00b5L, and solution substitution (PBS, complete, 0.01% NaN3) was carried out. Then, the concentration of the antibody protein was calculated by SDS-PAGE.</p>13. Experiment of inhibition of binding of EGF by successfully obtained anti-HER1 antibody (048-006 antibody)13-1 Experimental procedureA431 cells were cultured in 15\u03d5 culture dish (medium: DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% PS), and the cells were peeled off with the use of cell dissociation buffer (GIBCO: 13151-014) and recovered at 90% confluence. Two ml of PBS containing 1.0% BSA and 0.05% NaN<sub>3</sub> was added and the recovered cells were suspended. The suspension was stood still at 4\u00b0C for 30 minutes and then 100 \u00b5l each (about 2.5\u00d710<sup>5</sup> cells) was dispensed into each well of a 96-well V-bottom plate. It was centrifuged (650 G) for 2 minutes, and the cells were precipitated to remove the supernatant. Each antibody solution (HR1-007 [10 \u00b5g/ml], 48-006 [10 \u00b5g/ml, 5 \u00b5g/ml, 1 \u00b5g/ml], and 59-152 [10 \u00b5g/ml, 5 \u00b5g/ml, 1 \u00b5g/ml]) (200 \u00b5l), which had been prepared by using PBS containing 1.0% BSA, was added and the cells were suspended. The suspension was stood still at 4\u00b0C for one hour, and then, biotin labeled EGF (biotinated EGF: 50 \u00b5g/ml) was added to each well so that the final concentration became 1 \u00b5g/ml, so that the cells were suspended. Note here that the biotinated EGF was produced by the following method. Firstly, to EGF (prepared to 1 mg/ml with PBS(-); AUSTRAL Biologicals: GF-010-5) (50 \u00b5l), EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (prepared to 2 mg/ml with PBS(-); PIERCE: 21335) (25 \u00b5l) was added. After it was stood still at room temperature for 30 minutes, 1M glycine (pH = 7.0 to 8.0) (1",
    "inal concentration: 500 \u00b5g/ml). This was 10-fold diluted with PBS containing 1.0% BSA and used for experiment.</p>This was stood still at 4\u00b0C for one hour, and centrifuged (650 G) for 2 minutes so as to remove the supernatant. PBS containing 1.0% BSA (180 \u00b5l) was added and centrifuged (650 G) for 2 minutes so as to remove the supernatant. HRP-labeled streptavidin (0.2 \u00b5g/ml (PBS containing 1.0% BSA); PIERCE: 21126) (100 \u00b5l) was added and cells were suspended at 4\u00b0C for one hour, and centrifuged (650 G) for 2 minutes so as to remove the supernatant. PBS containing 1.0% BSA (180 \u00b5l) was added and centrifuged (650 G) for 2 minutes so as to remove the supernatant. This operation was carried out again. OPD (Wako: 154-01673) coloring solution (100 \u00b5l) was added and cells were suspended. After four miniuted at room temperature, coloring stop solution (2N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) (100 \u00b5l) was added and centrifuged (650 G) for 2 minutes. Then, the supernatant was transferred to a flat-bottom plate. By using a plate reader, the absorbance at 192 nm (A492) was measured and represented by a numeric value.</p>13-2 ResultsThe results are shown in Fig. 24. HR1-007 as a control does not affect the binding of EGF. 048-006 antibody and 059-152 antibody inhibit the binding of EGF. 048-006 antibody can inhibit the binding of EGF substantially completely while 059-152 antibody cannot completely inhibit the binding even if the temperature is increased. Note here that 048-006 antibody shows an inhibition effect even at the low level of about 0.02 \u00b5g/ml (Fig. 24C).</p>The results suggest that the antagonism activity between each antibody (048-006 antibody and 059-152 antibody) and EGF provides a part of the pharmacological effect such as anti-tumor property.</p>14. Experiment of phosphorylation signal inhibition of HER1 by successfully obtained anti-HER1 antibody (048-006 antibody)By using a phosphorylation antibody, it was determined whether or not he successfully obtained anti-HER1 antibody (048-006 antibody) inhibited the phosphorylation signal of HER1. Specifically, by using three kinds of cells (renal cell carcinoma (CCF-RC1, Caki-1) and epidermoid cancer (A431)), the inhibition effect of 048-006 antibody and 059-152 antibody and the inhibition effect of ERBITUX were compared with each other.</p>14-1 Experimental procedureEach of cells was cultured in 6-well culture dish, and at 60% confluence, a medium (DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% PS) was substituted to DMEM. After 16 hours, each antibody (HR1-007, 048-006, 059-152 (prepared to 2 mg/ml with PBS(-))) and ERBITUX were added to each well so that the final concentration became 10 \u00b5g/ml or 1 \u00b5g/ml. After 30 minutes, EGF (prepared to 20 \u00b5g/ml with PBS(-)) was added to each well so that the final concentration became 1 \u00b5g/ml. After 30 minutes, each well was washed with PBS(-) and quickly frozen together with the culture dish by using liquid nitrogen. To each well, lysis buffer (50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na3VO4, 10 mM NaF, 1% TritonX100, complete (Roche: 11836145001)) were added, and the cells were suspended and transferred to centrifugation tube. Centrifugation (10000G) was carried out for 10 minutes so as to precipitate cell debris. A part of the supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE, which was transferred to a membrane. Western blotting using an anti-phosphorylation tyrosine antibody (1 \u00b5g/ml; upstate: 05-321) or an anti-\u03b2-actin antibody (1 \u00b5g/ml; abcam: ab25139) as a primary antibody, and a secondary antibody reaction: HRP labeled anti-mouse IgG as a secondary antibody was carried out. A431 cells were required to be exposed to light for 1 to 2 seconds; CCF-RC1 for 10 seconds; and Caki-1 for one minute (there was originally large difference in cell sensitivity to external stimulation).</p>14-2 ResultsThe results are shown in Fig. 25 (A and B: the results of Western blotting using A431 cells; C to E: comparison effect of inhibiting HER1 phosphorylation signal between the successfully obtained antibody and ERBITUX). In CCF-RC1 and A-431 cell lines, HR1-007 as a control does not affect the phosphorylation signal of HER1. However, 048-006 antibody and 059-152 antibody inhibit signal in a concentration-dependent manner. 048-006 antibody can inhibits the binding of EGF substantially completely and also inhibit self phosphorylation of HER1 substantially completely. 059-152 antibody inhibits the binding of EGF about 50%. Furthermore, 059-152 antibody inhibits self phosphorylation of HER1 although it is weaker than 048-006 antibody. 048-006 antibody and 059-152 antibody have inhibition capabilities superior to that by ERBITUX. In particular, the inhibition capability of 048-006 antibody is remarkable.</p>The sensitivity to external stimulation by EGF differs depending upon the kinds of cells. Therefore, when a cell like Caki-1 that does not show sensitivity to external stimulation by EGF is used, the difference in signal inhibition effect by the antibody is not observed.</p>The results suggest that each antibody (048-006 antibody and 059-152 antibody) has an activity of suppress the tyrosine kinase circuit of HER1 with respect to sensitive cells of HER1 by EGF, and exhibits pharmacological effects such as proliferation suppression and anti-tumor property.</p>15. Measurement of binding constant by BIAcoreAs to the successfully obtained antibodies 048-006 and 059-152, the dissociation constant with respect to the expression Her1 was measured.</p>15-1 Experimental procedure(1) Forced expression of partial sequence of Her1A sequence from a region after the signal of HER1 to immediately before the transmembrane region (621 amino acid of the expression sites from positions 26 to 645 (SEQ ID NO: 943) was cloned. For cloning and expression, a pSecTagII vector (Invetrogen) was used. When this vector is inserted, myc and his tags are added.</p>(2) Recovering of expressed cellsOne 15\u03d5-culture dish (80 confluent) in which 293T cells were cultured was prepared. The medium was replaced with new one so that cells were not peeled off, and then cultured. Thus, a state in which cells were aggregated at 90-100% confluence was formed. The day before recovering cells, final medium replacement was carried out. DNA (75 \u00b5l) was added to D-MEM (serum free) (1.9 ml) and subjected to tapping adjustment so as to make the solution A. Furthermore, Lipo (75 \u00b5l) was added to D-MEM (serum free) (1.9 ml) and subjected to tapp",
    "hat of 048-006 antibody.</p>Furthermore, 067-153 antibody as anti-EpCAM antibody shows an excellent ADCC activity to MKN-45 (solid-type gastric adenocarcinoma) cell line at the concentration of 0.01 \u00b5g/ml or more, and it shows an excellent ADCC activity to HT-29 (colon adenocarcinoma) cell line at the concentration of 10 pg/ml or more with an amazing score of 80% or more in the ADCC activity in the concentration range of about 1 \u00b5g/ml. It shows an amazing score of 50% or more in the ADCC activity in NCI-H1373 (pulmonary adenocarcinoma) cell line at the concentration of 0.01 \u00b5g/ml or more.</p>Furthermore, 041-118 antibody as anti-ALCAM antibody shows a remarkable effect to NCI-H1373 (pulmonary adenocarcinoma) cell line at the concentration of 0.01 \u00b5g/ml or more, it turned out to obtain expected the effect in the low dosage.</p>Furthermore, 067-133 antibody as anti-HGFR antibody shows a remarkable effect to NCI-H1373 (pulmonary adenocarcinoma) cell line at the concentration of 0.01 \u00b5g/ml or more with strong activity of 40% or more at the concentration of 10 \u00b5g/ml or more.</p>From the above-mentioned results, it is confirmed that a promising antibody group showing a sufficient ADCC activity even with low dosage (at low concentration) can be obtained successfully. Also in the similar experiments using a plurality of lymphocyte fractions derived from human, the same results as mentioned above can be obtained. The high reproducibility is confirmed.</p>17. Cancer cell proliferation inhibition testSome antibody medicines exhibit the efficacy by an effect of inhibiting the proliferation of cancer instead of the ADCC effect (or in addition to the ADCC effect). Thus, in order to further investigate the efficacy of antibody medicine, the activity of inhibiting the proliferation of cancer by antibodies that have been successfully isolated have been investigated according to the following procedure.</p>17-1 Testing method(1) Target culture cells that have grown in a culture dish are peeled off with 4% Collagenase and suspended in the used medium.(2) The cell density is measured and then the supernatant is removed by centrifugation and suspended in a RPMI-1640 (10% FBS, 1% Penicillin - Streptomycin) medium so that the final density is 1.0 x 10<sup>4</sup> cells/ml.(3) 100 \u00b5l each of target cells is dispensed in a flat-bottom 96 well multi plate.(4) 100 \u00b5l each of 20 \u00b5g/ml human IgG monoclonal antibody solution is dispensed.(5) Reaction is carried out in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37\u00b0C for 5 days.(6) Medium is removed, and living cell measurement reagent (XTT: Roche) is dispensed in each well (150 \u00b5l each).(7) Reaction is carried out in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37\u00b0C for 4 hours.(8) After reaction, OD490 and OD690 are measured by using a micro plate absorptiometer. Then, the number of living cells is calculated according to the following equation.XTT reduction amountdegree of coloring=OD\u2062490-OD\u2062690XTT reducing activity derived from cells=experimental value-control value us"
