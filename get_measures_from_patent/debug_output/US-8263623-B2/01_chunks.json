The pellet was re-suspended in buffer and the homogenisation and centrifugation steps repeated. The resulting pellet was re-suspended in 1 ml buffer per 1 ml original packed cell volume and the homogenisation step repeated. Protein estimation was carried out on the suspension and 1 ml aliquots of \u02dc1 mg/ml frozen at \u221280\u00b0 C.</p>hM<sub>3 </sub>Competition Binding Assay Protocol</p>Membranes (5 \u03bcg/well) were incubated with <sup>3</sup>H-NMS (at a concentration 5\u00d7K<sub>D</sub>) plus/minus test compound for 24 hr at RT (room temperature) in a 1 ml polystyrene 96-well deep well block. The final assay volume was 200 \u03bcl, comprising of: 20 \u03bcl plus/minus test compound; 20 \u03bct, <sup>3</sup>H-NMS (Perkin Elmer NEN 636) and 160 \u03bcl membrane solution. Total Binding was defined with 0.1% DMSO; Non-Specific Binding was defined with 1 \u03bcM Atropine. Assay buffer was 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.4).</p>Once all assay components were added, plates were covered and incubated at room temperature for 24 hrs with shaking. The assay was terminated by rapidly filtering through GF/B Unifilter plates pre-soaked with 0.5% polyethylenimine, using a Packard filtermate harvester, the filter plate was then washed with 3\u00d71 ml 4\u00b0 C. assay buffer. The filter plates were dried at 45\u00b0 C. for 1 hour. The bottoms of the filter plates were sealed and 50 \u03bcl/well of Microscint \u20180\u2019 added, the top of the plates were sealed with a Topseal. Following 90 mins, the plates were read on an NXT Topcount (1 minute read time per well).</p>The resulting data was expressed as a percentage of the specific binding (Specific binding=Total binding\u2212Non-Specific Binding). % specific binding versus test compound concentration was plotted to determine an IC<sub>50 </sub>from a sigmoid curve using an in-house data analysis programme. IC<sub>50 </sub>values corrected to Ki values by applying the Cheng-Prussoff equation:</p>Cheng-Prussoff Equation:</p>Ki=IC501+[L]/KD\nwhere IC<sub>50 </sub>is the concentration of unlabelled drug which inhibits by 50% the specific radioligand binding. [L] is the free radioligand concentrations and K<sub>D </sub>and K<sub>i </sub>are the equilibrium dissociation constants of the radioligand and unlabelled drug respectively.\n\nFunctional Assessment of Agonist Potency and Efficacy Using a Whole cell cAMP Assay in CHO Cells Expressing the h\u03b2<sub>2 </sub>Receptor\n\nCell Culture\n</p>CHO (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells recombinantly expressing the human adrenergic \u03b2<sub>2 </sub>receptor were maintained in growth media composed of F12:DMEM (Gibco 21331-020) containing 10% Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS: Sigma F4135), 10 \u03bcg/ml puromycin (Sigma P8833), 0.1 mg/ml Geneticin G418 (Sigma G7034) and 2 mM L-glutamine (Sigma G7513). The cells were kept in sterile conditions at 37\u00b0 C., in an atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>h\u03b2<sub>2 </sub>cAMP Assay Protocol</p>Cells were harvested for assay when they reached 80-90% confluency using trypsin 0.25% (Sigma T4049) incubated with the cells for 5 min at 37\u00b0 C. in an atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Detached cells were collected in warmed growth media (composition described above), and re-suspended in assay media (F12:DMEM (Gibco 21331-020) containing 1% Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS: Sigma F4135) and 2 mM L-glutamine (Sigma G7513)) to give a viable cell concentration of 0.25\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml. 100 \u03bcl of this suspension was added to each well of a tissue culture treate",
    "hen 50 \u03bcl PBS plus 0.5 mM IBMX was added to the assay plates, followed by the addition of 50 \u03bcl of each compound test concentration to the appropriate well. 50 \u03bcl per well of 2% DMSO or 200 nM Formoterol was added to the control wells, giving a final assay concentration of 1% DMSO or 100 nM Formoterol. Plates were returned to the incubator for a further 30 mins. At the end of the incubation period the PBS plate wash procedure was repeated a final time as described above. The plates were pat dried and 30 \u03bcl per well PBS added followed by 40 \u03bcl per well cAMP II ED/Substrate mix and 40 \u03bcl per well cAMP II EA-Ab/lysis mix (DiscoverX 90-0034-03). The plates were then incubated in the dark for a minimum of 4 hours at room temperature. The plates were read using a Fusion plate reader (luminescence protocol, each well read for 1 second). Concentration effect curves were plotted and EC<sub>50 </sub>&amp; E<sub>max </sub>values determined using a 4-parameter sigmoid fit generated using an in-house data analysis programme. Formoterol and salmeterol were run in every assay as reference standards.</p>It has thus been found that compounds of formula (1) according to the present invention that have been tested in the above assays show h\u03b2<sub>2 </sub>receptor agonist activity and hM<sub>3 </sub>receptor antagonist activity as listed in the table below:</p>CHO cell hM<sub>3</sub>ExampleCHO cell h\u03b2<sub>2 </sub>cAMPCHO cell h\u03b2<sub>2 </sub>cAMPbindingNumberEC<sub>50 </sub>(nM)E<sub>max </sub>(%)Ki (nM)114.01030.570221.61060.153320.6910.924413.0900.5055116952.49</p>"
