The hydroxylation of tolbutamide was measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of these compounds. Racemic halofenic acid inhibited CYP 2C9 activity with an IC50 of 0.45 \u03bcM and (+) halofenic acid inhibited CYP 2C9 with an IC50 of 0.22 \u03bcM. In contrast, the (\u2212) halofenic acid was 20-fold less potent with an apparent IC50 of 3.5 \u03bcM.</p>FIG. 2 shows the time course of glucose-lowering following a single oral dose of racemic halofenate, (\u2212) enantiomer of halofenate or (+) enantiomer of halofenate at 250 mg/kg in diabetic ob/ob mice. The (\u2212) enantiomer showed the most rapid onset of action and the longest duration of action. The decrease in glucose was significant (p&lt;0.05) for the (\u2212) enantiomer compared to control for all points from 3 to 24 hours. Racemic halofenate and the (+) enantiomer were also significant (p&lt;0.05) for all points from 4.5 to 24 hours. The plasma glucose at 24 hours was 217\u00b116.4 mg/dl in animals treated with the (\u2212) enantiomer, compared to 306\u00b128.5 mg/dl and 259.3\u00b120.8 mg/dl for animals treated with the (+) enantiomer and the racemate, respectively. The plasma glucose in the vehicle treated controls was 408\u00b116.2 mg/dl at 24 hours. The (\u2212) enantiomer was more effective and significantly different (p&lt;0.05) from the (+) enantiomer at both the 3 hour and 24 hour time points.</p>FIG. 3 shows the ability of racemic halofenate and both the (\u2212) and (+) enantiomers of halofenate to lower plasma glucose in diabetic ob/ob mice following daily oral administration. The racemate was given at a dose of 250 mg/kg/day and the enantiomers were given at doses of 125 mg/kg/day and 250 mg/kg/day. Significant decreases in glucose levels relative to control animals were observed in animals treated with racemic halofenate and both the (\u2212) and (+) enantiomers. At the low dose (125 mg/k"
