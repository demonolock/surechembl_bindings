    " Another object of the invention is to provide a composition for eradicating the toxin and the bacterium or the microorganism that produces it.</p>Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide means for preventing and treating organisms that are subject to inflammation.</p>Another object of the invention is to provide a means of eliminating pro-inflammatory cytokines.</p>The present invention therefore relates to a composition comprising monoclonal antibodies directed either against a circulating pro-inflammatory cytokine or against a circulating bacterial toxin, said antibodies having a high affinity for the Fc\u03b3RIIIa (CD16) receptor, for its use in the context of prevention or treatment of early stages of inflammation.</p>Antibodies are secreted by cells of the immune system, plasma cells (also called secretory B cells) and are the main immunoglobulins of blood. Subsequently, the terms \"immunoglobulin\" and \"antibody\" are equivalent.</p>An antibody binds to the antigen for which it is specific. The antigen can be soluble or membrane and is constituted either by an element foreign to the body (bacterial, viral antigen, ...) or by a constituent element of the body (auto-antigen).</p>According to one embodiment of the invention, the antigen is either a circulating pro-inflammatory cytokine or a circulating bacterial toxin.</p>The structure of immunoglobulins (Ig) is well known to those skilled in the art. These are tetramers consisting of two heavy chains of about 50 kD each (called H chains for Heavy) and two light chains of about 25 kD each (called L chains for Light), linked together by Intra and interbody disulfide bridges.</p>Each chain consists, in the N-terminal position, of a region or variable domain, called VL for the light chain, VH for the heavy chain, and in the C-terminal position, of a constant region, consisting of a single domain called CL for the light chain and three or four domains named CH1, CH2, CH3, CH4, for the heavy chain.</p>Only IgM and IgE have the CH4 domain. </p>The constant domains are encoded by the C genes and the variable domains are encoded by the V-J genes for the light chain and V-D-J for the heavy chain.</p>The assembly of the chains which compose an antibody makes it possible to define a characteristic three-dimensional structure in Y, where:  the base of Y corresponds to the constant region Fc which is recognized by complement and Fc receptors (RFc) in order to mediate the effector functions of the molecule, and  the ends of the Y arms correspond to the respective assembly of the variable region of a light chain and the variable region of a heavy chain, said ends determining the specificity of the antibody for the antigen. </p>More precisely, there are five isotypes of heavy chains (gamma, alpha, mu, delta and epsilon) and two isotypes of light chains (kappa and lambda, the lambda chains being themselves divided into two types: lambda 1 and lambda 2). . It is the heavy chain that determines the class of immunoglobulin. There are thus five classes of Ig: IgG for the g",
    " the basis of the composition of the bacteria wall, that of gram-positive bacteria being very rich in peptidoglycan unlike that of gram-negative bacteria.</p>Gram-positive bacteria are, for example, those belonging to the genus Staphylococcus, Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Enterococcus, Listeria, etc.</p>Gram-negative bacteria are, for example, bacteria of the genus Salmonella, Escherichia Coli, Pseudomonas, etc.</p>Only pathogenic bacteria cause a bacterial infection. The pathogenicity is related to the virulence factors of the bacterium, namely genetic factors (chromosomal or extrachromosomal), said factors being indeed responsible for the implantation of the bacterium, its multiplication or its harmful effects (related to the release of toxins especially). The bacterial infection is divided into several phases. The first is the colonization of the host by the bacterium (for example, during a deep wound with an object contaminated by Clostridium tetani, by injury or consumption of food  contaminated by Clostridium botulinum , by the respiratory tract by Corynebacterium diphtheriae ...), said step being followed by the exponential phase of growth of the bacteria, phase during which said bacteria fight against the immune system and use the nutrients of the host which they need to grow. Then comes the release of the toxins and the binding of the latter on their targets, resulting in an alteration of the normal functioning of the host cell (modification of electrolyte exchanges, inhibition of protein synthesis ...), or the lysis of the cell host.</p>The bacterial infections according to the invention refer to all the infections associated with the release of any exotoxin (such as tetanus toxin, botulinum toxin, diphtheria toxin, etc.) or the release of any endotoxin, in the bloodstream.</p>The invention relates to a monoclonal antibody composition directed against a circulating bacterial toxin, having an affinity for the Fc\u03b3RIIIa receptor (CD16) improved with respect to antibodies directed against said bacterial toxin, produced in the CHO cell line, for use in the framework for the prevention or treatment of the early phases of a bacterial infection related to the release of said toxin.</p>The antibodies according to the invention thus act during the early phases of the infection.</p>\"Early phases of a bacterial infection\" means the phases corresponding to the time interval between the release of the toxin by the bacterium and the binding to the membrane receptor or before the entry of the toxin into the cell. target, when the target is intracellular. In other words, the early stages of these diseases correspond to the moment when the toxin is free in the body and therefore when it is accessible to the antibodies.</p>This aspect of the invention is based on the finding made by the inventors that it is possible using antibodies having a high affinity for Fc\u03b3RIII receptors to induce the rapid clearance (elimination) of circulating toxins, as soon as po",

Advantageously, the antibodies may be produced in a cell line selected from YB2 / 0, Vero, CHO-lec10, CHO-lec13, CHO-lecl, CHOK1SV, CHO Knock Out for fucosyltransferase FUT8, CHO expressing GnTIII.</p>Particularly advantageously, the antibodies of the invention are produced in a rat hybridoma cell line. In a preferred embodiment, the antibodies are produced in YB2 / 0 rat hybridoma (YB2 / 3HL.P2.G11.16Ag.20 cell, deposited at  the American Type Culture Collection under number ATCC CRL-1662) selected for its ability to produce antibodies with high affinity for CD16.</p>Other methods are known to those skilled in the art for producing antibodies with optimized glycosylation. For example, the use of a glycosylation inhibitor such as kifunensine (alpha mannosidase II inhibitor), which can be added to the culture medium of the antibody-producing cells according to the invention, according to the method described in  US 7,700,321 </patcit> . Fucose analogs can also be introduced into the culture medium of antibody-producing cells as described in the document  US 20090317869 </patcit> . Another way of producing antibodies with optimized glycosylation is the use of cells for which the GDP-fucose production pathway is inhibited, through the inhibition of at least one of the enzymes of the production cycle of the fucose, as described for example in the document  US 2010291628 </patcit> or  US 20090228994 </patcit> , the document  EP 1,500,698 </patcit> , the document  EP 1 792 987 </patcit> or the document  US 7,846,725 </patcit> , this list not being limiting. It is also possible to use RNA interference inhibiting (RNAi) inhibiting 1,6-fucosyltransferase as described in document  US 7,393,683 </patcit> or the document  WO 2006133148 </patcit> .</p>Other methods for preparing optimized glycosylation antibodies in transgenic animals are described in  WO 200748077 </patcit> . Antibodies can also be produced in yeasts, as shown in the document  WO 0200879 </patcit> .</p>In order to produce antibodies with 100% non-fucosylated oligosaccharides, that is to say totally free of fucose at the level of glycosylation carried by Asn297, it is possible to use the preparation methods described in the documents  EP 1 176 195 </patcit> ,  US 7,214,775 </patcit> ,  US 6,994,292 </patcit> ,  US 7,425,446 </patcit> ,  US2010223686 </patcit> ,  WO2007099988 </patcit> ,  EP 1 705 251 </patcit> , this list not being limiting. In a particular embodiment, the antibodies are produced in cells modified by deletion of the gene coding for \u03b11,6-fucosyltransferase or by addition of a mutation of this gene to eliminate \u03b11,6-fucosyltransferase activity.</p>According to another aspect, the invention relates to a composition comprising a populat",
    "bstrate (H <sub>2</sub> O <sub>2</sub> and tetramethylbenzidine). After 20 min of incubation, the reaction was stopped with 50 \u03bcl of diluted H <sub>2</sub> SO <sub>4</sub> , and the OD was read at 450 nm. The results for adalimumab produced by transgenesis are presented at  figure 10  . </p>CD16 binding, competition with 3G8 antibodyTo evaluate the binding of adalimumab produced by transgenesis to CD16, a displacement displacement study with anti-CD16 antibody 3G8, (Santa Cruz Biotech) was performed. The displacement assay determined the binding efficiency of adalimumab produced by transgenesis to the CD16 receptor expressed on the membrane surface of NK cells.</p>Natural killer cells (NK cells) were purified by negative depletion (Miltenyi) from the peripheral blood of healthy donors. NK cells were then incubated at varying concentrations of adalimumab produced by transgenesis (from 0 to 83 \u03bcg / ml) and at a fixed concentration of the anti-CD16 3G8 antibody conjugated to a fluorochrome (3G8-PE). After washing, binding of 3G8-PE to CD16 receptor on NK cells was assessed by flow cytometry. The mean fluorescence values (VMF) observed were expressed as percentage of binding; a value of 100% corresponds to the value observed without the adalimumab produced by transgenesis and which therefore corresponds to the maximum binding of 3G8. A value of 0% corresponds to the VMF in the absence of 3G8 antibodies. IC <sub>50</sub> , i.e., the antibody concentration required to induce a 50% inhibition of Imax of the 3G8 binding, was calculated using the PRISM software. The results are presented at  figure 11  .</p>Binding of soluble TNF-\u03b1 with adalimumab produced by CD16 transgenesis expressed on Jurkat cells via the Fc fragment of adalimumab produced by transgenesisJurkat-CD16 cells were incubated with 10 \u03bcg / ml of the adenimumab produced by transgenesis or the deglycosylated version thereof for 20 min at 4 \u00b0 C. After washing, 100 \u03bcl of TNF-\u03b1 were added to the cell pellet at the final concentration of 1 \u03bcg / ml, for 20 min at 4 \u00b0 C. After further washing, the cells were incubated with 5 \u03bcg / ml of a goat anti-human TNF-\u03b1 biotinylated goat antibody for 20 min at 4 \u00b0 C. After another wash cycle, binding of TNF-\u03b1 was visualized by addition of streptavidin coupled to fluorochrome-PE for 20 min at 4 \u00b0 C. The samples were analyzed by flow cytometry. The results are presented at  figure 12  . </p>Results :Example 1 : adalimumab produced by transgenesisThe glycosylation profile of the adalimumab antibodies produced in the milk of transgenic goats was determined by the release of the N-glycans from the antibody and the column analysis of the oligosaccharides thus released.  The  Figures 1-4  and 6-8 show the oligosaccharides (N-glycans) released from the adalimumab antibody produced by transgenesis from goat # 1 (  Figures 1-4  ) and goat # 2 (  Figures 6-8  ). The groups of monosaccharides are represented as follows:  Black square: N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)  Triang",
    "ha and Jurkat cells expressing CD16 whereas the unglycosylated version of the adalimumab antibody produced by transgenesis is incapable.</p>Example 3 : Phagocytosis testMaterial of Example 3The following reagents were used:  anti-TNF transgenic Humira,  \u2218 not deglycosylated (ie glycosylated)  \u2218 deglycosylated  anti-TNF Humira, (Adalimumab, Abbott)  IVIg polyvalent immunoglobulins (Tegeline, LFB) </p>Monocytes isolated from peripheral blood were thawed and differentiated into macrophages for 3 days in RPMI 1640 + 10% FCS + M-CSF at 50 ng / ml. TNF-\u03b1 was labeled with the Lightning-Link Rapid Conjugation System Innova Biosciences kit (green fluorescence) according to the manufacturer's instructions and then incubated for 20 minutes at 4 \u00b0 C with 10 \u03bcg / ml anti-TNF alpha antibody.</p>The phagocytosis was carried out for 3 hours at 4 \u00b0 C. and 37 \u00b0 C. by incubating the labeled TNF-\u03b1 with the macrophages (1.105 cells / well) in the presence or in the absence of 1 mg / ml of IVIg immunoglobulins.</p>The phagocytosis index analyzed by flow cytometry is estimated according to the following formula: MFI 37 \u00b0 C - MFI 4 \u00b0 C (Arbitrary unit).</p>The results are presented in the  Figure 13 .</p>Macrophages alone (negative control) show no fluorescence at 4 \u00b0 C and 37 \u00b0 C.</p>In the presence of the non-deglycosylated transgene adalimumab antibody (TG-Humira), TNF-\u03b1 and macrophages, the phagocytosis value is 15 (MFI).</p>Under the same conditions, the addition of IVIg (1 mg / ml) induces an inhibition of the attachment of the TG-Humira antibody to macrophages (FcR). This is observed at 4 \u00b0 C and 37 \u00b0 C. Phagocytosis is estimated at 13.3 (MFI).</p>In the presence of Abbott Humira antibody (Humira commercial) TNF-\u03b1 and macrophages, the value of phagocytosis is 12.5 (MFI).</p>Under the same conditions the addition of IVIg (1 mg / ml) induces an inhibition of the binding of the Abbott Humira antibody to macrophages (FcR). This is observed at 4 \u00b0 C and 37 \u00b0 C. Phagocytosis is estimated at 6.72 (MFI)  These results therefore show that the TG-Humira antibody induces phagocytosis of TNF-\u03b1 in the presence of CD16 + macrophages greater than that induced by the commercial adalimumab antibody (Humira, Abbott).</p>"
