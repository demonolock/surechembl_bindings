    "t bond and single-chain Fv has a structure in which a heavy-chain variable region and a light-chain variable region are linked by covalent bond via a peptide linker, or are directly linked at the C-terminal, to form a dimer-like structure, like the two-chain Fv. The antigen-binding fragment may be obtained using a protease (e.g., Fab can be obtained by restriction-cleaving the whole antibody with papain, and the F(ab\u2032)2 fragment can be obtained by restriction-cleaving the whole antibody with pepsin), and may be prepared by genetic recombination techniques.</p>As herein used, the term \u201chinge region\u201d refers to a region which is included in the heavy chain of an antibody, is interposed between CH1 and CH2 domains, and functions to impart flexibility to the antigen-binding site in the antibody.</p>The anti-MUC1 antibody may be a monoclonal antibody. The monoclonal antibody can be prepared in accordance with a method well-known in the art, for example, by a phage display technique. Alternatively, the monoclonal antibody may be derived from mice through a conventional method using the anti-MUC1 antibody.</p>Meanwhile, individual monoclonal antibodies can be screened based on the binding ability with MUC1 using a typical ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) format. The inhibitory activity can be tested through functional analysis such as competitive ELISA for testing the molecular interaction on bound substances, and functional analysis such as cell-based assays. The affinity (Kd value) to MUC1 of selected monoclonal antibody members based on strong inhibitory activity is tested.</p>At least one of CDR1 to CDR3 of light and heavy chains contained in the anti-MUC1 antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof according to the present invention, as well as peptides and aptamers having substantially the same binding ability and specificity for the MUC1 antigen, fall within the scope of the anti-MUC1 antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof according to the present invention.</p>In another aspect, the present invention relates to a hybridoma producing the anti-MUC1 antibody. In the present invention, the hybridoma is deposited under the accession number KCLRF-BP-00395.</p>The present invention provides an anti-MUC1 antibody produced by the hybridoma or an antigen-binding fragment thereof. In another example, the present invention provides an anti-MUC1 antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof that includes a heavy-chain complementarity determining region (CDR-H1, CDR-H2, CDR-H3, or a combination thereof) or a light-chain complementarity determining region (CDR-L1, CDR-L2, CDR-L3, or a combination thereof) of the anti-MUC1 antibody produced by the hybridoma, or a combination thereof; or a heavy-chain variable region or a light-chain variable region of the anti-MUC1 antibody produced by the hybridoma or a combination thereof. In this case, the complementarity determining region may be determined by any conventional method, for example, through I"
