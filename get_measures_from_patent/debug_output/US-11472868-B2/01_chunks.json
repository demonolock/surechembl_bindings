    "sub>domain residues with gp120 are as follows: Trp50<sub>HC</sub>: indole N\u2014H hydrogen bonds with the side chain oxygen of Asn280<sub>gp120</sub>; Asn58<sub>HC</sub>: side chain N\u2014H hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyl of Arg456<sub>gp120</sub>; Arg71<sub>HC</sub>: side chain hydrogen bonds/salt bridges with the side chain of Asp368<sub>gp120</sub>; and Trp102<sub>HC</sub>: indole N\u2014H hydrogen bonds with the side chain oxygen of Asn/Asp279<sub>gp120</sub>. Trp102<sub>HC </sub>also buries 85 \u212b<sup>2 </sup>of surface area at the V<sub>H</sub>/V<sub>L </sub>interface\u2014contacting residues Tyr89<sub>LC </sub>and Glu90<sub>LC</sub>.</p>In the light chains, the side chain of Glu90<sub>LC </sub>forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone nitrogen of Gly459<sub>gp120 </sub>and/or the side chain of Asn280<sub>gp120</sub>. The conservation of Trp65<sub>LC</sub>/Phe65<sub>LC </sub>is surprising as this position is distant from gp120 in the available crystal structures.</p>For those interactions that depend on specific gp120 side chains, the degree of conservation of the relevant gp120 residues is 96.4% for Asn/Asp279<sub>gp120</sub>, 96.4% for Asn280<sub>gp120</sub>, and 99.7% for Asp368<sub>gp120 </sub>(based on the 2010 filtered web alignment of 2869 HIV-1 sequences in the Los Alamos HIV database; http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/). Arg456<sub>gp120</sub>, which is involved in a main-chain hydrogen bond with the sidechain of Asn58<sub>HC</sub>, is also highly conserved (95.0%).</p>An SPR-based binding assay demonstrated detectable binding of the germline heavy chain/mature light chain IgG to immobilized gp140 trimers. Binding of germline heavy chain IgGs was analyzed with substitutions in the four signature heavy chain residues (W50S, N58S, R71T, and W102S) (again paired with the mature 3BNC60 light chain). The W50S, R71T, and W102S mutants showed little or no gp140 binding, and the N58S mutation diminished binding by about 20-fold, consistent with the corresponding PVL characteristic residues playing key roles in recognition of the HIV-1 envelope spike by the germline PVL B cell receptor.</p>To examine the importance of the signature PVL residues to their activity, the gp120 sequences of HIV-1 strains resistant to neutralization by NIH45-46 were analyzed. The gp120 residue variants associated with resistance were identified by three criteria: first, they are contact residues with NIH45-46; second, they are absent in NIH45-46-resistant viruses; third, they do not appear in NIH45-46-sensitive viruses. The critical positions identified were 279<sub>gp120</sub>, 280<sub>gp120</sub>, 456<sub>gp120</sub>, 458<sub>gp120</sub>, and 459<sub>gp120</sub>; the common (i.e., sensitive) residues at these positions are Asx, Asn, Arg, Gly, and Gly, respectively, where Asx is Asp or Asn. These sites make significant contacts with the characteristic PVL residues (FIG. 16). Viral stains with variations at these sites are generally neutralized poorly by all PVL antibodies, as expecte"
