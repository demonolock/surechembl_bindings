    "nd mannitol, the particles were aggregated. The combination and concentration of sugars satisfy the isotonicity requirement, form an elegant cake post lyophilization, and serve to stabilize the protein antigen. The osmolarity of a vaccine product should be in the range of 280 to 330 mOsm/L. The concentrations of sucrose and mannitol or trehalose and mannitol used with the PVA are in the appropriate osmolarity range and lead to a lyophilized cake that is the same size as the initial liquid volume. DSS was also found to provide adequate resuspension at sufficient concentration in trehalose and mannitol. [0245] Large (221 nm) and small (122 nm) nanoparticles were also analyzed upon resuspension using varying concentrations of PVA (wt/wt PLG) plus 4% sucrose (w/v) and 3% mannitol (w/v). The PLG content was 5mg/mL. The amount of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) associated with the pellet versus free in solution was measured by first separating the solid phase of the suspension by centrifugation (Eppendorf 5415D, 20 minutes at 13200 rpm) and removing the supernatant fraction. Both mixtures were hydrolyzed overnight in 2N NaOH, pH neutralized and an aliquot of the clear solution was analyzed following a previously described method (J.H. Finley (1961) Anal. Chem. 33: 1925-1927); E. Allemann et al. (1998) Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 34: 171-189), in which 0.2 mL of the test solution was mixed with 1.00 mL of 4% w/w boric acid and 0.20 mL of an iodine solution (1.27% w/w I<sub>2</sub> and 2.5% w/w KI) and the absorbance read at 644 nm and compared to a calibration curve with linearity &gt; 0.995 (R<sup>2</sup>). [0246] Results are presented in Table. 3. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that additional PVA needed to resuspend the smaller nanoparticles is most likely due primarily to their larger surface area compared to the larger nanoparticles, although there was also likely an effect to due partitioning of the PVA between the surface and the solution. \n\n TABLE 3</p>\n  Small Nanoparticles (122 nm)</p>\n  PVA concentration \n\n</p>\n  PLG) PLG) l%(w/w) PVA 10 47 \u03bcm 8</p>\n  3%(w/w) PVA 30 24 \u03bcm 13</p>\n  5%(w/w) PVA 50 15 \u03bcm 18</p>\n  7%(w/w) PVA 70 393 nm 25</p>\n  10%(w/w) PVA 100 149 nm 35</p>\n  Large Nanoparticles (221 nm)</p>\n  PVA concentration total PVA final size pellet (\u03bcg FVA/ mg (\u03bcg FVA/ mg</p>\n  PLG) PLG) l%(w/w) PVA 10 17 \u03bcm 6</p>\n  3%(w/w) PVA 30 260 nm 1 1</p>\n  5%(w/w) PVA 50 243 nm 17</p>\n  7%(w/w) PVA 70 241 nm 20</p>\n  10%(w/w) PVA 100 240 nm 24</p>\n  EXAMPLE 3. PROTEIN ADSORPTION EFFICIENCY FOR NANOPARTICLES AND</p>\n  MlCROPARTICLES</p>\n  [0247] For the same particle mass, nanoparticles have a much larger surface area as compared to microparticles. In this case, the nanoparticles allow for more efficient protein loading per particle mass compared to the 1 \u03bcm microparticles. This allows for the delivery of the same amount of protein antigen with less PLG (and consequently less total surfactant).</p>\n  [0248] A model antigen, bovine serum "
