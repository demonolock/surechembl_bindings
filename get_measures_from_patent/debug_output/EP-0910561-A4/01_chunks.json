    "ase as a potentially important factor in its regulation. \n\n The potency of the inhibitors was determined using an ion selective electrode to measure the production of ammonia as the result of the hydrolysis of 100 \u03bcM oleamide (~20 KJ by a membrane bound preparation of oleamide hydrolase. The K\u201e of oleamide was found to be 5 \u00b1 2 \u03bcM. Inhibition constants were determined by the Dixon method (Figures 4-6) . Subject to solubility limitations, all inhibitors that were tested were able to achieve 100% inhibition at high concentrations and no inhibitor exhibited polymodal inhibition behavior characteristic of two or more separate active sites with different K<sub>\u03b1</sub>s. Since the likelihood of two or more different enzymes binding twenty-two separate inhibitors with nearly identical affinity is remote, this strongly suggests that a single enzyme in the preparation is responsible for greater than 90% of the observed oleamide hydrolase activity.</p>The most potent inhibitors (Figure 1) possess an electrophilic carbonyl group capable of reversibly forming a (thio) hemiacetal or (thio) hemiketal to mimic the transition state of a serine or cysteine protease catalyzed reaction (Figure 8) . The relative potencies of the inhibitors were found to follow the expected electrophilic character of the reactive carbonyl cumulating in the tight binding \u03b1-keto ethyl ester 8 (1.4 nM) and the trifluoromethyl ketone inhibitor 12 (1.2 nM) . A similar correlation between carbonyl electrophilicity and binding constant has been observed in inhibitors of insect juvenile \n\nhormone esterase (Linderman et al., Rev. Pestic . Toxicol . 1991, 1 , 261-9) and anandaminase (Koutek et al., J. Biol . Chem. 1994, 269, 22937-22940). However, the most electrophilic member of the set, the tricarbonyl inhibitor 11 bound relatively poorly at 150 nM. This behavior may be the result of destabilizing stearic interactions between the bulky tert-butyl ester and the enzyme or may be in part due to the sp<sup>2</sup> character at C-3, which is uncharacteristic of the natural substrate.</p>The extent of hydration and the relative electrophilic character of the inhibitor carbonyls could be easily and accurately assessed by NMR analysis and they were found to follow the expected trends (e.g. 11 &gt; 12 &gt; 8 &gt; 6 \u2265 4) . The central carbonyl of the tricarbonyl inhibitor 11 was fully hydrated upon preparation and characterization. The remaining agents were isolated and characterized as their carbonyl structures without hydration including the reactive trifluoromethylketones. <sup>\u03b1</sup>H NMR and <sup>13</sup>C NMR were used to establish and quantitate the addition of CD<sub>3</sub>OD or D<sub>2</sub>0 to the electrophilic carbonyl in CD<sub>3</sub>OD and acetone-d<sub>6</sub>, respectively (Figure 2) . Representative of these trends, 11 and 12 were fully converted to their hemiacetals in CD<sub>3</sub>OD, and the remaining agents showed diminished hemiacetal formation consistent with their expected ",
    "ty limits, all inhibitors achieved 100% inhibition of activity at concentrations of greater than 100 K<sub>L</sub> . No detectable activity was found in the absence of added oleamide. Likewise, only a very minimal rate of ammonia production from 100 \u03bcM oleamide was detected in the absence of enzyme at this pH. This suggests that the catalytic oleamide hydrolysis activity observed in this crude enzyme preparation arises from a single protein.</p>The K-, for oleamide was determined as the average K., obtained from four independent assays. Each independent K,. was obtained from weighted linear fit of data in a Lineweaver-Burke plot. A fifth concurring K., was obtained as a result of the \n\ndetermination of oleic acid inhibition by non-linear methods. The rate data was fit with the standard Michaelis-Menten kinetic equation. (The equation for the rate of Ping Pong Bi Bi kinetics collapses to the simple Michaelis-Menten-like equation when the concentration of the second substrate, in this case water, is constant.) In the range 30 - 100 \u03bcM, the reaction rate has essentially a zero order dependence on substrate concentration.</p>Because we have not yet been able to determine the amount of oleamide hydrolase present in the enzyme sample, we do not present values for V<sub>MX</sub> here. Our inhibition data suggests that the enzyme concentration is lower than 2 nM, since higher enzyme concentrations would have caused significant depletion of inhibitor in solution, causing the apparent Ki to be measured as [EJ/2 in the limiting case of [E] \u00bb K<sub>\u00b1</sub>. Since 1 nM was the lowest inhibition constant measured, [E] &lt; 2 nM.</p>Error values presented with KiS should be considered goodness-of-fit estimates derived from propagation of errors treatment of data. They are not necessarily an indication of reproducibility. However, in cases where experiments were repeated, results were within statistical agreement as predicted by the apparent error values given here.</p>pH-Rate Dependence</p>Crude enzyme was added to a solution of 200 \u03bcM oleamide (approximately the solubility limit) 1 in 20 mL buffer at the appropriate pH, containing 5% DMSO. \n\n(Concentrations of up to 20% DMSO had only minimal effect on enzyme rates.) A 50 mM sodium citrate/Bis-tris buffer was used for data points in the pH 4-9 range. A 50 mM Bis-tris/CAPS was used for data points in the 8-11 range. At pH 12, the solution was assumed to be self-buffering. At periodic time intervals, 1 mL aliquots were removed and diluted with 9 mL pH 14 buffer. Ammonia concentrations were measured with an ion-selective ammonia electrode (Orion) connected to a 720A meter (Orion), calibrated against known standards. The rate was obtained from the linear portion of the curve which was fit using a standard least-squares procedure. These rates were replotted against pH and fit with the equation in figure 12 (Fersht, A.,</p>Enzyme Structure and Mechanism; W. H. Freeman and Co.: New York, 1985, pp 157 Connors, K. A., Binding Constants; Wiley: New York, 1987, pp 385-395) by a weighted non-linear least-squares method"
