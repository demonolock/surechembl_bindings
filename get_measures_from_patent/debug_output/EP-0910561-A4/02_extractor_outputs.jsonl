{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n* The K-, for oleamide was determined as the average K., obtained from four independent assays, with a value of approximately 1 nM.\n* Our inhibition data suggests that the enzyme concentration is lower than 2 nM, since higher enzyme concentrations would have caused significant depletion of inhibitor in solution, causing the apparent Ki to be measured as [EJ/2 in the limiting case of [E] \u00bb K<sub>\u00b1</sub>.\n* Error values presented with Ki should be considered goodness-of-fit estimates derived from propagation of errors treatment of data, with values of up to 1 nM.\n* A 50 mM sodium citrate/Bis-tris buffer was used for data points in the pH 4-9 range, with oleamide concentrations of up to 200 \u03bcM.\n* Crude enzyme was added to a solution of 200 \u03bcM oleamide (approximately the solubility limit) 1 in 20 mL buffer at the appropriate pH, containing 5% DMSO, with no specific Ki value mentioned but related to oleamide.\n* Likewise, only a very minimal rate of ammonia production from 100 \u03bcM oleamide was detected in the absence of enzyme at this pH, with no specific Ki value but related to oleamide.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, it appears that only the following sentences contain all the required components:\n\n* Our inhibition data suggests that the enzyme concentration is lower than 2 nM, since higher enzyme concentrations would have caused significant depletion of inhibitor in solution, causing the apparent Ki to be measured as [EJ/2 in the limiting case of [E] \u00bb K<sub>\u00b1</sub>.\n* Error values presented with Ki should be considered goodness-of-fit estimates derived from propagation of errors treatment of data, with values of up to 1 nM.\n\nNote that the other sentences do not contain all the required components, such as a specific numeric value for the metric and a unit for that value."}
