    "d fragments further include those that specifically bind to a given epitope of MMP9. In some cases, the epitope is an epitope specifically bound by any of the above-described antibodies. In one example, the epitope contains an amino acid residue (i.e., one or more amino acid residue(s)) outside of cysteine-switch active pocket of SEQ ID NO: 27. In certain examples, the epitope includes an amino acid residue (i.e., one or more amino acid residue(s)) within a given region of MMP9, for example, where the region is residues 104-202 of SEQ ID NO: 27. In some examples, the epitope includes an amino acid residue (i.e., one or more amino acid residue(s)) within a given region of MMP9, for example, where the region is residues 104-119, residues 159-166, or residues 191-202 of SEQ ID NO: 27. In one example, the epitope includes an amino acid residue (i.e., one or more amino acid residue) within a region of MMP9 that is residues 104-119 of SEQ ID NO: 27, an amino acid residue within a region of MMP9 that is residues 159-166 of SEQ ID NO: 27, and an amino acid residue within a region of MMP9 that is residues 191-202 of SEQ ID NO: 27. In some cases, the epitope includes E111, D113, R162, or 1198 of SEQ ID NO: 27. In some cases, it includes R162 of SEQ ID NO: 27. In some cases, it includes E111, D113, R162, and I198 of SEQ ID NO: 27.</p>In some cases, the antibody or fragment is human or is humanized.</p>In some examples, the antibodies and fragments specifically bind to human MMP9 with a dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) equal to or lower than 100 nM, optionally lower than 10 nM, optionally lower than 1 nM, optionally lower than 0.5 nM, optionally lower than 0.1 nM, optionally lower than 0.01 nM, or optionally lower than 0.005 nM, in certain examples, between 0.1 and 0.2 nM, or between 0.1 and 10 pM, e.g., between 0.4 and 9 pM, such as between 0.4 and 8.8 pM, in the form of monoclonal antibody, scFv, Fab, or other form of antibody measured at a temperature of about 4\u00b0C, 25\u00b0C, 37\u00b0C or 42\u00b0C.</p>Also among the described antibodies and fragments are those having at least at or about 75 %, 80 %, 85 %, 90 %, 91 %, 92 %, 93 %, 94 %, 95 %, 96 %, 97 %, 98 %, 99 % or more sequence identity with any of the above-described antibodies or containing various portions with at least at or about 75 %, 80 %, 85 %, 90 %, 91 %, 92 %, 93 %, 94 %, 95 %, 96 %, 97 %, 98 %, 99 % or more sequence identity with the respective portions of the antibodies described above, such as having a VH region with such identity with SEQ ID NO: 7 and a VL region with such identity with SEQ ID NO: 12. Also described are antibodies that compete for binding to MMP9 with any of the above-described antibodies, such as those that compete for binding to MMP9 with an antibody having a VH region with the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 7 and a VL region with the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 12.</p>Also described are isolated nucleic acids encoding the antibodies and fragments, su",
    "9 complexes. A level of MMP9 in the sample in comparison with a level of a reference sample can indicate the presence of a tumor or tumor-associated tissues having MMP9 activity. The reference sample can be a sample taken from the subject at an earlier time point or a sample from another individual.</p>Various aspects of the invention are further described and illustrated by way of the several examples which follow, none of which are intended to limit the scope of the invention.</p>EXAMPLESExample 1A: Preparation of antibodies to human MMP-9.The full-length human MMP9 protein without a signal peptide (SEQ ID NO. 28) was used to immunize mice. Spleen cells from immunized mice were fused with myeloma cells to generate a hybridoma library. Monoclonal cultures were prepared and screened to identify cultures expressing an anti-MMP9 monoclonal antibody.</p>An antibody (AB0041) was purified from one of the cultures and characterized. This antibody contained an IgG2b heavy chain and a kappa light chain. Characterization included testing for the binding of AB0041 to other human MMPs and to MMP9 proteins from other species, including cynomolgus monkey, rat and mouse. As shown in Table 2, the AB0041 antibody had greater affinity to human and cynomolgus MMP9, that it had lower affinity to rat MMP9. In addition, the AB0041 antibody did not bind to murine MMP9 or to many human non-MMP matrix metalloproteinases.\nTable 2: Cross reactivity of AB0041 and AB0045MMP TestedDissociation constant (Kd)AB0045AB0041Human MMP 1&gt;100 nM&gt;100 nMHuman MMP2&gt;100 nM&gt;100 nMMouse MMP2&gt;100 nM&gt;100 nMHuman MMP3&gt;100 nM&gt;100 nMHuman MMP7&gt;100 nM&gt;100 nMHuman MMP8&gt;100 nM&gt;100 nMHuman MMP90.168 \u00b1 0.117 nM0.133 \u00b1 0.030 nMCynomolgus monkey MMP90.082 \u00b1 0.022 nM0.145 \u00b1 0.16 nMMouse MMP9&gt;100 nM&gt;100 nMRat MMP90.311 \u00b1 0.017 nM0.332 \u00b1 0.022 nMHuman MMP10&gt;100 nM&gt;100 nMHuman MMP 12&gt;100 nM&gt;100 nMHuman MMP13&gt;100 nM&gt;100 nM</p>Additional characterization included assaying the binding of AB0041 to mutant mouse and human MMP9 proteins. Non-identical residues in the catalytic domain of mouse and human MMP9 proteins were identified, and forty-six non-identical amino acid residues were selected for mutagenesis. Most mutations were generated in mouse MMP9: the mouse amino acid residues were mutated to match those of human MMP9. Other mutations were generated in human MMP9: the human amino acid residues were mutated to match those of mouse MMP9. The mutated mouse or human MMP9 proteins were used in an ELISA assay.</p>In the ELISA assay, the AB0041 antibody was used as the primary antibody and a goat anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was used to detect the binding. The wild-type human MMP9 was used a positive control and the wild-type mouse MMP9 was used as a negative control. The results of the ELISA assay showed an arginine residue at position 162 of the MMP9 amino acid sequence (R162) as important for the MMP9 binding of the A",
    "the AB0046 antibodies showed it bound to mouse MMP9 with the K<sub>d</sub> value of 0.218 \u00b1 0.097 nM. In the SPR analysis, the results showed that the K<sub>d</sub> values of AB0045 and AB0041 antibodies for human MMP9 were 8.8 pM and 0.4 pM, respectively.</p>The enzymatic inhibitory activities of AB0045, AB0041, and AB0046 antibodies were evaluated in an assay assessing MMP9-mediated cleavage of a fluorogenic peptide substrate Mca-PLGL-Dpa-AR-NH2. All three antibodies inhibited MMP9 enzyme activity. The IC<sub>50</sub> values of AB0045 (0.691 \u00b1 0.097 nM) and AB0041 (0.569 \u00b1 0.185 nM) for human MMP9 were not statistically different. The IC<sub>50</sub> value for the AB0046 inhibition of mouse MMP9 was 0.352 \u00b1 0.03 nM. The value was not adjusted for the concentration of active enzyme that was generated during the preparation. Additional MMP9 enzymatic assay under steady-state conditions was used to determine IC<sub>50</sub> and mode of inhibition. In this assay, the IC<sub>50</sub> values of AB0045 ranged from 0.148 nM to 0.161 nM in a 20-fold range of substrate concentration, and in one example is 0.158 nm. The results showed that the MMP9 inhibitory activity of AB0045 was non-competitive.\nTable 2B: Binding and Inhibitory Properties of AB0045, AB0041, and surrogate mouse antibody AB0046AB0045AB0041AB0046ELISAHuman MMP9 Dissociation constant0.168 \u00b1 0.117 nM0.133 \u00b1 0.030 nM&gt;100 nMCynomolgus monkey MMP9 Dissociation constant0.082 \u00b1 0.022 nM0.145 \u00b1 0.16 nM&gt;100 nMMouse MMP9 Dissociation constant&gt;100 nM&gt;100 nM0.218\u00b10.097 nMRat MMP9 Dissociation constant0.311 \u00b1 0.017 nM0.332 \u00b1 0.022 nM&gt;100 nMSPRHuman MMP9 Dissociation constant8.8pM0.4pMNDActivity AssayHuman MMP9 IC<sub>50</sub>0.691 \u00b1 0.097 nM0.569 \u00b1 0.185 nM&gt;100 nMCynomolgus monkey MMP9 IC<sub>50</sub>0.194 \u00b1 0.048 nM*0.189 \u00b1 0.019 nM*&gt;100 nMRat MMP9 IC<sub>50</sub>8.23 \u00b1 1.24 nM*2.78 \u00b1 1.17 nM *&gt;100 nMMouse MMP9 IC<sub>50</sub>&gt;100 nM&gt;100 nM0.352\u00b10.03 nM*</p>The results confirmed that AB0045 and AB0041 have equivalent binding and inhibitory properties and that AB0046 can serve as a relevant mouse surrogate antibody, for example, in mouse models of human disease.\n&lt;110&gt; GILEAD BIOLOGICS, INC.
