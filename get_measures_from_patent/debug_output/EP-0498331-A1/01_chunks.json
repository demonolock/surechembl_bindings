For most assays, a 1mM stock solution of the test compound is made up in a suitable solvent and serially diluted such that the final concentration in the assay ranges from 2 X 10\u207b\u2078 to 2 X 10\u207b\u2075M. Seven concentrations are used for each assay.</p>C. TISSUE PREPARATIONMale Wistar rats are decapitated and the brain rapidly removed. Either whole brain minus cerebella or hypothalmus is weighed and homogenized in 9 volumes of ice-cold 0.32 M sucrose using a Potter-Elvejhem homogenizer. The homogenate is centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 minutes at 0-4\u00b0C. The supernatant (S\u2081) is decanted and is used for uptake determination.</p>D. ASSAY800 \u00b5l KHBB + [\u00b3H]-5HT\n20 \u00b5l Vehicle or appropriate drug\n200 \u00b5l Tissue suspension concentration</p>Tubes are incubated at 37\u00b0C under a 95%O\u2082/5% CO\u2082 atmosphere for 5 minutes. For each assay, 3 tubes are incubated with 20 \u00b5l of vehicle at 0\u00b0C in an ice bath. After incubation all tubes are immediately centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 minutes. The supernatant fluid is aspirated and the pellets dissolved by adding 1 ml of solubilizer (Triton X-100 and 50% ethanol, 1:4 v/v). The tubes are vigorously vortexted, decanted into scintillation vials, and counted in 10 ml of Liquiscint scintillation counting cocktail. Active uptake is the difference between cpm at 37\u00b0C and 0\u00b0C. The per cent inhibition at each drug concentration is the mean of three determinations. IC\u2085\u2080 values are derived from log-probit analysis.</p>The results of this assay for representative compounds of this invention as well as reference compounds are presented in Table 2. \nTABLE 2COMPOUND5-HT-IC\u2085\u2080(\u00b5M)[4-[2-[3-[1,2-Benzisoxazol-3-yl]-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-8-yl]ethoxy]-3-methoxyphenyl]ethanone fumarate0.01[4-[4-[3-[1H-Indazol-3-yl]-8-azabicyclo-[3.2.1]octan-8-yl]butoxy]-3-methoxyphenyl]ethanone fumarate hemihydrate0.07[4-[4-[3-[6-Fluoro-1H-indazol-3-yl]-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]-octan-8-yl]butoxy]-3-methoxyphenyl]ethanone0.02[4-[4-[3-[1,2-Benzisothiazol-3-yl]-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-8-yl]butoxy]-3-methoxyphenyl]ethanone monohydrochloride0.027Chloripramine (reference)0.15Fluoxetine (reference)0.247</p>Antidepressive response is achieved when the compounds of the present invention are administered to a subject requiring such treatment as an effective oral, parenteral, or intravenous dose of from 1 to 100 mg/kg of body weight per day.
