In general, a \u201csmall molecule\u201d is a molecule that is less than about 5 kilodaltons (kD) in size. In some embodiments, a small molecule is less than about 4 kD, 3 kD, about 2 kD, or about 1 kD. In some embodiments, the small molecule is less than about 800 daltons (D), about 600 D, about 500 D, about 400 D, about 300 D, about 200 D, or about 100 D. In some embodiments, a small molecule is less than about 2000 g/mol, less than about 1500 g/mol, less than about 1000 g/mol, less than about 800 g/mol, or less than about 500 g/mol. In some embodiments, a small molecule is not a polymer. </p>[0060] In some embodiments, a small molecule does not include a polymeric moiety. In some embodiments, a small molecule is not and/or does not comprise a protein or polypeptide (e.g., is not an oligopeptide or peptide). In some embodiments, a small molecule is not and/or does not comprise a polynucleotide (e.g., is not an oligonucleotide). In some embodiments, a small molecule is not and/or does not comprise a polysaccharide; for example, in some embodiments, a small molecule is not a glycoprotein, proteoglycan, glycolipid, etc.). In some embodiments, a small molecule is not a lipid. </p>[0061] In some embodiments, a small molecule is a modulating agent (e.g., is an inhibiting agent or an activating agent).

In some embodiments, provided compounds are estrogen receptor agonists. As used herein, an \u201cestrogen receptor agonist\u201d refers to a compound or composition that produces an agonistic effect when contacting the estrogen receptor of a subject or biological sample. In some embodiments, an estrogen receptor agonist is characterized by having (i) at least 80% increase in the E2 -normalized signal in the AP assay (agonist mode) of Example 209 and (ii) no more than 80% reduction in the E2-normalized signal in the AP assay (antagonist mode) of Example 209. In some embodiments, provided compounds are estrogen receptor antagonists. As used herein, an \u201cestrogen receptor antagonist\u201d refers to a compound or \n\ncomposition that produces an antagonistic effect when contacting the estrogen receptor of a subject or biological sample. In some embodiments, an estrogen receptor antagonist is characterized by having: </p>1. (i) between 10% and 80% increase in the E2-normalized signal in the AP assay (agonist mode) of Example 209 and (ii) between 10% and 80% reduction in the E2- normalized signal in the AP assay (antagonist mode) of Example 209; </p>2. (i) a pIC50 greater than 6.4 and at least a 10% reduction in the E2-normalized signal in the AP assay (antagonist mode) of Example 209; and (ii) no more than 10% increase in E2 -normalized signal in the AP assay (agonist mode) of Example 209; or </p>3. (i) a pICso greater than 7.5 and at least a 10% reduction in the E2 -normalized signal in the AP assay (antagonist mode) of Example 209; and (ii) no more than 10% increase in E2 -normalized signal in the AP assay (agonist mode) of Example 209. </p>[0071] In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides compounds that are complete estrogen receptor (ER) antagonists. As used herein, a \u201ccomplete estrogen receptor antagonist\u201d refers to a compound or composition that produces an antagonistic effect when contacting the estrogen receptor of a subject or biological sample, with minimal agonistic effect (e g., with no or substantially no agonistic effect). Complete estrogen receptor antagonism is determined according to methods described herein, for example in Example 209. In some embodiments, a complete estrogen receptor antagonist is characterized by having (i) a pICso greater than 6.4 and at least a 10% reduction in the E2-normalized signal in the AP assay (antagonist mode) of Example 209; and (ii) no more than 10% increase in E2 -normalized signal in the AP assay (agonist mode) of Example 209.
