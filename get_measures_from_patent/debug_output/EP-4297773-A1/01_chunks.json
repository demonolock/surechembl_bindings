    " an acidic surface exposed amino acid residue with an uncharged amino acid residue; iii. substitution of an uncharged surface exposed amino acid residue with a basic amino acid residue; iv. insertion of a basic amino acid residue; and v. deletion of an acidic surface exposed amino acid residue. A modification as indicated above results in a modified BoNT/A or fragment thereof that has an increased positive surface charge and increased isoelectric point when compared to the corresponding unmodified BoNT/A or fragment thereof. The isoelectric point (pI) is a specific property of a given protein. As is well known in the art, proteins are made from a specific sequence of amino acids (also referred to when in a protein as amino acid residues). Each amino acid of the standard set of twenty has a different side chain (or R group), meaning that each amino acid residue in a protein displays different chemical properties such as charge and hydrophobicity. These properties may be influenced by the surrounding chemical environment, such as the temperature and pH. The overall chemical characteristics of a protein will depend on the sum of these various factors. \n<!-- EPO <DP n=\"29\"/>-->\n\u00a0 Certain amino acid residues (detailed below) possess ionisable side chains that may display an electric charge depending on the surrounding pH. Whether such a side chain is charged or not at a given pH depends on the pKa of the relevant ionisable moiety, wherein pKa is the negative logarithm of the acid dissociation constant (Ka) for a specified proton from a conjugate base. For example, acidic residues such as aspartic acid and glutamic acid have side chain carboxylic acid groups with pKa values of approximately 4.1 (precise pKa values may depend on temperature, ionic strength and the microenvironment of the ionisable group). Thus, these side chains exhibit a negative charge at a pH of 7.4 (often referred to as \u201cphysiological pH\u201d). At low pH values, these side chains will become protonated and lose their charge. Conversely, basic residues such as lysine and arginine have nitrogen-containing side chain groups with pKa values of approximately 10-12. These side chains therefore exhibit a positive charge at a pH of 7.4. These side chains will become de-protonated and lose their charge at high pH values. The overall (net) charge of a protein molecule therefore depends on the number of acidic and basic residues present in the protein (and their degree of surface exposure) and on the surrounding pH. Changing the surrounding pH changes the overall charge on the protein. Accordingly, for every protein there is a given pH at which the number of positive and negative charges is equal and the protein displays no overall net charge. This point is known as the isoelectric point (pI). The isoelectric point is a standard concept in protein biochemistry with which the skilled person would be familiar. The isoelectric point (pI) is therefore defined as the pH value at which a protein display"
