    "he fact that increased levels of both cGMP and cAMP are involved in the process of LTP forming (Blokland et al., 2006; Prickaerts et al., 2002). LTP is regarded as the electrophysiological basis of long term memory (Baddeley, 2003). Boess et al. (2004) showed that PDE2 inhibitors amplify the generation of long term potentiation (LTP). Additionally, it is reported that the selective PDE2 inhibitor BAY60-7550 enhances learning and memory in rats and mice in different animal models (Boess et al., 2004; Rutten et al., 2006). Thus, BAY60-7550 is efficacious in the novel object recognition test, the social recognition test and the T-maze, an animal model of working memory.</p>Furthermore, the expression of PDE2 in the nucleus accumbens (part of the striatum), the olfactory bulb, the olfactory tubercle and the amygdale supports additional involvement of PDE2 in the pathophysiology of anxiety and depression (Modell et al., 1990). As described above, PDE2 inhibitors increase cAMP and cGMP in neuronal cells. There is evidence that chronic administration of antidepressants up-regulates the cAMP pathway at several levels, including increased expression of the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) (Duman, 1998; Nibuya et al., 1996). In contrast, patients with depression show an impairment of the cAMP pathway. Thus, Shelton et al. (1999) detected a reduction of cAMP associated protein kinase A in depressive patients. Finally, Masood et al. (2008) report an anxiolytic effect of PDE2 inhibition in mice. They reversed oxidative stress-induced anxiety by the PDE2 inhibitor BAY60-7550.</p>Consequently, PDE2 inhibitors are described to have a potential to alleviate central nervous system (CNS) disorders, e.g. depression and Alzheimer's disease but also peripheral diseases like metabolic disorders, septic shock and cancer. PDE10 (PDE10A) is primarily expressed in the brain and here in the nucleus accumbens and the caudate putamen. Areas with moderate expression are the thalamus, hippocampus, frontal cortex and olfactory tubercle (Menniti et al., William Harvey Research Conference, Porto, Dec. 6-8, 2001). All these brain areas are described to participate in the pathomechanism of schizophrenia (Lapiz et al., Neurosci Behav Physiol 33: 13-29, 2003) so that the location of the enzyme indicates a predominate role in the pathomechanism of psychosis.</p>PDE2 inhibitors address a novel target in the brain. PDE2 inhibitors are described to have an antidepressant and anxiolytic effect. Additionally, they improve impaired but also un-impaired learning and memory (Boess et al., 2004; Rutten et al., 2006b). Thus, PDE2 inhibitors are a promising new target to improve the therapy of CNS disorders, especially depression and Alzheimer's disease.</p>Several families of PDE2 inhibitors are known. Imidazotriazinones are claimed in WO 02068423 for the treatment of e.g. memory deficiency, cognitive disorders, dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Oxindoles are described in WO 05041957 for the treatment of dementia. Further inhibitors of PDE2 are known from WO 07121319 for the treatment of anxiety and depression, from WO 06072615, WO 06072612, WO 06024640 and WO 05113517 for the treatment of arthritis, cancer, edema and septic shock, from WO 05063723 for the treatment of renal and liver failure, liver dysfunction, restless leg syndrome, rheumatic disorders, arthritis, rhinitis, asthma and obesity, from WO 05041957 for the treatment of cancer and thrombotic disorders, from WO 06102728 for the treatment of angina pectoris and hypertension from WO 08043461 for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders, erectile dysfunction, inflammation and renal failure and from WO 05061497 for the treatment of e.g. dementia, memory disorders, cancer and osteoporosis.</p>Finally, benzodiazepines are claimed in WO 2005063723 for the general treatment of CNS diseases including anxiety, depression, ADHD, neurodegeneration, Alzheimer's disease and psychosis.</p>Unfortunately, there is no PDE2 inhibitor that could be successfully developed to become a treatment medication. Most of them are not optimal for CNS penetration or suffer on pure physical properties.</p>There is still an urgent need to provide new PDE2 inhibitors with improved properties for the treatment of diseases where inhibition of PDE2 is of therapeutic value.</p>In the striatum PDE10A is predominately found in the medium spiny neurons and they are primarily associated to the postsynaptic membranes of these neurons (Xie et al., Neuroscience 139: 597-607, 2006). By this location PDE10A may have an important influence on the signal cascade induced by dopaminergic and glutamatergic input on the medium spiny neurons two neurotransmitter systems playing a predominate role in the pathomechanism of psychosis.</p>Phosphodiesterase (PDE) 10A, in particular, hydrolyses both cAMP and cGMP having a higher affinity for cAMP (Km=0.05 \u03bcM) than for cGMP (Km=3 \u03bcM) (Soderling et al., Curr. Opin. Cell Biol 12: 174-179, 1999).</p>Psychotic patients have been shown to have a dysfunction of cGMP and cAMP levels and its downstream substrates (Kaiya, Prostaglandins Leukot Essent Fatty Acids 46: 33-38, 1992; Muly, Psychopharmacol Bull 36: 92-105, 2002; Garver et al., Life Sci 31: 1987-1992, 1982). Additionally, haloperidol treatment has been associated with increased cAMP and cGMP levels in rats and patients, respectively (Leveque et al., J Neurosci 20: 4011-4020, 2000; Gattaz et al., Biol Psychiatry 19: 1229-1235, 1984). As PDE10A hydrolyses both cAMP and cGMP (Kotera et al., Biochem Biophys Res Commun 261: 551-557, 1999), an inhibition of PDE10A would also induce an increase of cAMP and cGMP and thereby have a similar effect on cyclic nucleotide levels as haloperidol.</p>The antipsychotic potential of PDE10A inhibitors is further supported by studies of Kostowski et al. (Pharmacol Biochem Behav 5: 15-17, 1976) who showed that papaverine, a moderate selective PDE10A inhibitor, reduces apomorphine-induced stereotypies in rats, an animal model of psychosis, and increases haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats while concurrently reducing dopamine concentration in rat brain, activities that are also seen with classical antipsychotics. This is further supported by a patent application establishing papaverine as a PDE10A inhibitor for the treatment of psychosis (US Patent Application Pub. No. 2003/0032579).</p>In addition to classical antipsychotics which mainly ameliorate the positive symptoms of psychosis, PDE10A also bears the potential to improve the negative and cognitive symptoms of psychosis.</p>Focusing on the dopaminergic input on the medium spiny neurons, PDE10A inhibitors by up-regulating cAMP and cGMP levels act as D1 agonists and D2 antagonists because the activation of Gs-protein coupled dopamine D1 receptor increases intracellular cAMP, whereas the activation of the Gi-protein coupled dopamine D2 receptor decreases intracellular cAMP levels through inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity (Mutschler et al., Mutschler Arzneimittelwirkungen. 8th ed. Stuttgart: Wissenschaftliche Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, 2001).</p>Elevated intracellular cAMP levels mediated by D1 receptor signaling seems to modulate a series of neuronal processes responsible for working memory in the prefrontal cortex (Sawaguchi, Parkinsonism Relat Disord 7: 9-19, 2000), and it is reported that D1 receptor activation may improve working memory deficits in schizophrenic patients (Castner et al., Science 287: 2020-2022, 2000).</p>Further indication of an effect of PDE10A inhibition on negative symptoms of psychosis was given by Rodefer et al. (Eur. J Neurosci 21: 1070-1076, 2005) who could show that papaverine reverses attentional set-shifting deficits induced by subchronic administration of phencyclidine, an NMDA antagonist, in rats. Attentional deficits including an impairment of shifting attention to novel stimuli belongs to the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. In the study the attentional deficits were induced by administering phencyclidine for 7 days followed by a washout period. The PDE10A inhibitor papaverine was able to reverse the enduring deficits induced by the subchronic treatment.</p>In conclusion, there is a need for new antipsychotic and antidepressant agents. This invention addresses this need and others.</p>SUMMARYThe present invention provides, inter alia, compounds of formula (I):</p><img id=\"EMI-C00002\" path=\"US20100120762A1-20100513-C00002.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/132859616/US/20100513/A1/020100/12/07/62/US20100120762A1-20100513-C00002.TIF\"/></p>or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.</p>The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</p>The present invention further provides a method of treating disorders associated with phosphodiesterase 2 or 10 hyperactivity, the method comprising administering to a patient in need thereof a therapeutica",
