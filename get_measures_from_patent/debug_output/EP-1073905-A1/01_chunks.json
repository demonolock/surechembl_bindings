    "ion provides a nucleic acid library encoding one of the phage display antibody libraries describe herein. The nucleic acid library comprises at least 10<sup>5</sup>, more preferably at least 10<sup>6</sup>, and most preferably at least IO<sup>7</sup> different phage or phagemid vectors.</p>This invention also provides kits for practice of the methods described herein. The kits preferably comprise one or more containers containing a phage display library (or a portion thereof) described herein. The kit can include nucleic acids encoding the library and/or phage particles expressing single chain antibodies (preferably a multivalent library) and/or cells containing the intact phage or nucleic acids from the phage.</p>DEFINITIONS</p>As used herein, an \"antibody\" refers to a protein consisting of one or more polypeptides substantially encoded by immunoglobulin genes or fragments of immunoglobulin genes. The recognized immunoglobulin genes include the kappa, lambda, alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon and mu constant region genes, as well as myriad immunoglobulin variable region genes. Light chains are classified as either kappa or lambda. Heavy chains are classified as gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon, which in turn define the immunoglobulin classes, IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE, respectively. A typical immunoglobulin (antibody) structural unit is known to comprise a tetramer. Each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one \"light\" (about 25 kD) and one \"heavy\" chain (about 50-70 kD). The N-terminus \n\n -6- of each chain defines a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The terms variable light chain (V_) and variable heavy chain (V<sub>H</sub>) refer to these light and heavy chains respectively.</p>Antibodies exist as intact immunoglobulins or as a number of well characterized fragments produced by digestion with various peptidases. Thus, for example, pepsin digests an antibody below the disulfide linkages in the hinge region to produce F(ab)'<sub>2</sub>, a dimer of Fab which itself is a light chain joined to V<sub>H</sub>-C<sub>H</sub>1 by a disulfide bond. The F(ab)'<sub>2</sub> may be reduced under mild conditions to break the disulfide linkage in the hinge region thereby converting the (Fab')<sub>2</sub> dimer into an Fab' monomer. The Fab' monomer is essentially an Fab with part of the hinge region (see, Fundamental Immunology, W.E. Paul, ed., Raven Press, N.Y. (1993), for a more detailed description of other antibody fragments). While various antibody fragments are defined in terms of the digestion of an intact antibody, one of skill will appreciate that such Fab' fragments may be synthesized de novo either chemically or by utilizing recombinant DNA methodology. Thus, the term antibody, as used herein also includes antibody fragments either produced by the modification of whole antibodies or synthesized de novo using recombinant DNA methodologies. Preferred antibodies include single",
    " antigen binding. The antigen binding site is formed by amino acid residues of the N-terminal variable (\"V\") regions of the heavy (\"H\") and light (\"L\") chains. Three highly divergent stretches within the V regions of the heavy and light chains are referred to as \"hypervariable regions\" which are interposed between more conserved flanking stretches known as \"framework regions\" or \"FRs\". Thus, the term \"FR\" refers to amino acid sequences which are naturally found between and adjacent to hypervariable regions in immunoglobulins. In an antibody molecule, the three hypervariable regions of a light chain and the three hypervariable regions of a heavy chain are disposed relative to each other in three dimensional space to form an antigen binding \"surface\". This surface mediates recognition and binding of the target antigen. The three hypervariable regions of each of the heavy and light chains are referred to as \"complementarity determining regions\" or \"CDRs\" and are characterized, for example by Kabat et al. Sequences of proteins of immunological interest, 4th ed. U.S. Dept. Health and Human Services, Public Health Services, Bethesda, MD (1987).</p>As used herein, the terms \"immunological binding\" and \"immunological binding properties\" refer to the non-covalent interactions of the type which occur between an immunoglobulin molecule and an antigen for which the immunoglobulin is specific. The strength or affinity of immunological binding interactions can be expressed in terms of the dissociation constant (K<sub>&lt;</sub>j) of the interaction, wherein a smaller Kd represents a greater affinity. Immunological binding properties of selected polypeptides can be quantified using methods well known in the art. One such method entails measuring the rates of antigen- binding site/antigen complex formation and dissociation, wherein those rates depend on the concentrations of the complex partners, the affinity of the interaction, and on geometric parameters that equally influence the rate in both directions. Thus, both the \"on rate constant\" (k<sub>on</sub>) and the \"off rate constant\" (k<sub>o f</sub>) can be determined by calculation of the concentrations and the actual rates of association and dissociation. The ratio of koff/ko<sub>n</sub> \n\n -8- enables cancellation of all parameters not related to affinity and is thus equal to the dissociation constant K<sub>&lt;</sub>j (see, generally, Davies et al. (1990) Ann. Rev. Biochem., 59: 439- 473.</p>The phrase \"specifically binds to a protein\" or \"specifically immunoreactive with\", when referring to an antibody refers to a binding reaction which is determinative of the presence of the protein in the presence of a heterogeneous population of proteins and other biologies. Thus, under designated immunoassay conditions, the specified antibodies bind to a particular protein and do not bind in a significant amount to other proteins present in the sample. Specific binding to a protein under such conditions may require an antibody that is selected for its specificity for a particular protein. For example, F5 or Cl antibodies can be raised to the c-erbB-2 protein that bind c-erbB-2 and not to other proteins present in a tissue sample. A variety of immunoassay formats may be used to select antibodies specifically immunoreactive with a particular protein. For example, solid-phase ELISA immunoassays are routinely used to select monoclonal antibodies specifically immunoreactive with a protein. See Harlow and Lane (1988) Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Publications, New York, for a description of immunoassay formats and conditions that can be used to determine specific immunoreactivity.</p>The terms \"polypeptide\", \"peptide\", or \"protein\" are used interchangeably herein to designate a linear series of amino acid residues connected one to the other by pe",
    "o compare the amount of phage remaining on the cell surface prior to cell lysis (last stripping wash) with the amount recovered after cell lysis. This ratio shows only a minor increase for monovalent C6.5 scFv or C6ML3-9 scFv phagemid (6.8 and 8.4 fold respectively) compared to anti-botulinum phagemid (5.4) (Table 7). In contrast the ratios for dimeric C6.5 diabody phagemid and multivalent C6.5 scFv phage increase to a greater extent (35 and 39 respectively) compared to anti-botulinum phagemid.</p>4) Increasing the enrichment ratios of specifically endocytosed phage</p>The results above indicate that phage antibodies can undergo receptor mediated endocytosis and remain infectious in a cell lysate. Selection of internalized phages from a phage library requires the optimization of the method to increase enrichment of specifically internalized phages over non-internalized phage. Two parameters can be \n\n -54- improved: (1) reduction of the recovery of non-specific or non-internalized phage and (2) preservation of the infectivity of internalized phage. To examine these parameters, we studied wild-type C6.5 scFv phagemid. We chose this molecule because it was clearly endocytosed based on confocal microscopy, yet was the molecule undergoing the least degree of specific endocytosis. C6.5 scFv phagemid also represents the most commonly utilized format for display of non-immune phage antibody libraries (single copy pLLI in a phagemid vector) and has an affinity (16 nM) more typical of Kd's of scFv from such libraries than the affinity matured C6ML3-9 scFv (Sheets et al. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95: 6157-6162; Vaughan et al. (1996) Nature Biotech. 14: 309-314).</p>a) Reducing the background of non-internalized phage</p>To reduce the background of non-specific phage recovery, we studied the effect of trypsinizing the cells prior to TEA lysis. This should remove phage trapped in the extracellular matrix. Trypsinization also dissociates the cells from the cell culture flask, permitting transfer to a new vessel and elimination of any phage bound to the cell culture flask. For these experiments, C6.5 scFv phagemid (5.0 x 10<sup>8</sup> ampicillin resistant cfu) were mixed with a 1000 fold excess of wild type fd phage (5.0 x 10<sup>1 1</sup> tetracylcine resistant cfu). After incubation of phagemid with SKBR-3 cells for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C, cells were washed with PBS and three times with stripping buffer. Cells were then directly lysed with TEA or treated with trypsin, washed twice with PBS and then lysed with TEA. Phagemid in the first stripping wash and the cell lysate were titered by infection of E. coli TGI and plated on ampicillin and tetracycline plates. The titer of fd phage and C6.5 scFv phagemid recovered from the cell surface was comparable for the two experimental groups (Figure 3). The ratio of fd phage/C6.5 scFv phagemid in the cell surface fractions (160/1 and 250/1) yields a 4 to 6 fold enrichment achieved by specific cell surface binding from",
    "ant cfu/ml of culture supernatant). The ratio of packaged phagemid DNA versus helper phage DNA (ampicillin versus kanamycin resistant cfu) was determined to be 100:1. To make multivalent phage containing a reporter gene, fd-F5-GFP phage were generated by infecting E. coli TGI carrying the pcDNA3-GFP phagemid (ampicillin resistant) with fd-F5 phage (tetracycline resistant), thus using fd-F5 phage as a helper phage. The fd-F5-GFP phage titer was approximately 5.0 x 10 ampicillin resistant cfu/ml of culture supernatant. Lower phage titers result when fd is used as a helper phage because it lacks a plasmid origin of replication leading to interference from the phagemid fl origin (Cleary and Ray (1980) Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 77(8): 4638-4642). The ratio of packaged reporter gene DNA versus phage DNA (ampicillin versus tetracycline resistant cfu) was 1 :1. The lower ratio of reporter gene/helper genome when using fd as a helper phage is due to the presence of a fully functional packaging signal on the fd genome compared to the mutated packaging signal in VCS-M13 (Vieira and Messing (1987) Meth. Enzymol 153: 3-11). Both phage and phagemid preparations were assessed for SKBR3 cell binding (Figure 7). While both preparations bound SKBR3 cells, binding could be detected with as little as 10<sup>8</sup> cfu ml of fd-F5-GFP phage cfu/ml (160 femtomolar) compared to 10<sup>10</sup> cfu/ml of F5-GFP phagemids (15 picomolar). Thus multivalent binding leads to an increase in the apparent binding constant of virus particles.</p>31 Targeted phagemid and phage mediated gene transfer into ErbB2 expressing breast cancer cells</p>To determine if ErbB2 binding phagemids were capable of targeted gene delivery, 2.0 x 10<sup>5</sup> SKBR3 cells (a breast tumor cell line expressing high levels of ErbB2) or 2.0 x 10<sup>5</sup> MCF7 cells (a low ErbB2 expressing breast tumor cell line) were incubated with 5.0 x 10 cfu/ml F5-GFP phagemids at 37\u00b0C. Cells were analyzed for GFP expression by FACS after 48 hrs (Figure 8A). 1.37% of the SKBR3 cells expressed GFP after incubation with F5-GFP phagemids (Figure 8A6). GFP expression was identical regardless of the orientation of the fl packaging signal (data not shown), indicating that transcription/translation was proceeding via synthesis of the complementary DNA strand. GFP expression was not detected in SKBR3 cells incubated with no phage or with helper \n\n -65- phage packaging the reporter gene (Figure 8A4 and 8A5). Expression was also not seen in MCF7 cells incubated with no phage, helper phage or pHEN-F5-GFP, indicating the requirement of ErbB2 expression for targeted gene delivery (Figure 8A1, 8A2 and 4A3). Since gene transfer applications are likely to involve targeting of specific cells in an heterogeneous cell population, we performed the same experiment on a co-culture of SKBR3 and MCF7 cells (Figure 8B). Cells were stained for ErbB2 expression to discriminate MCF7 from SKBR3 cells and the GFP expression of each subpopul"
