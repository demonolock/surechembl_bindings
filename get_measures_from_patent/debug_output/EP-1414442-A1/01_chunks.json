After 2 hours, methanol (5ml) and potassium carbonate (70mg, 0.5mmol) were added and the mixture heated to reflux for 2 hours. The cooled mixture was evaporated, treated with acetic acid (0.5ml), evaporated, and the residue subjected to flash chromatography on silica gel (eluting with dichloromethane - methanol aqueous ammonia) to afford the title compound as a colourless solid (E26) (30mg, 78%) \u03b4<sub>H</sub> (CDCI3 + trace Hunig's base) 3.04 (4H, br s), 3.0 (2H, br s), 3.18 (4H, br s), 6.79 (IH, d, J = 1.6Hz), 7.33-7.42 (2H, m), 7.53 (IH, d, J = 1.6Hz), 7.81-7.87 (3H, m); Mass Spectrum: m/z [MH]<sup>+</sup> 410, 412, 414, (C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>17</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>S).</p>\n  Pharmacological data</p>\n  Compounds can be tested following the procedures outlined in WO98/27081.
