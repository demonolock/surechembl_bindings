The reaction is initiated by adding enzyme and incubating the mixture at 25\u00b0C. After 2 minutes of incubation, the reaction is terminated by adding 500 microliters of ice cold 30% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The precipitate formed is transferred onto a glass fiber filter (Packard Unifilter-GF/C) and washed three times with 70% ethanol. After the filter is dried, the radioactivity is determined by scintillation counting.

TMZ was provided by Schering-Plough Research Institute (Kenilworth, NJ). Compound 13 was dissolved in 70 mM PBS without potassium.</p>For intracranial transplantation, cells (10<sup>4</sup> in 0.03 ml ofRPMI-1640) were injected intracranially (ic) through the center-m",
    "eased animal survival with respect to 10 mg/kg Compound 37 + TMZ for five days.</p>3) Enhancement of radiation treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinomaHuman HNSCC cell line JHU012 was used, having been previously genetically characterized and originally derived at the Johns Hopkins University Head and Neck Laboratories from human tumor explants. The cell line was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in 37\u00b0C humidified incubators.Experiments were performed on 6-week-old male BALB/c nude mice nu/nu. The animals were randomly divided into the following treatment groups: Group 1 - controls, Group 2 - Radiation alone (2 Gray (gy)/day for 2 days), Group 3 - 100mg/kg Compound 37 alone orally (PO) qdx17, Group 4 - 30mg/kg Compound 37 PO + Radiation, Group 5 - 100mg/kg Compound 37 PO + Radiation, with each group consisting of 8 mice. Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 3-5 mL tribromoethanol. Tumors were established at the right flank by subcutaneous injection of 1x10<sup>7</sup> cells. Fourteen days post cell injection tumors were surgically exposed and measured in 3 dimensions using calipers. Compound 37 was then dosed orally in treatment Groups 3-5. In Groups 4 and 5, animals received Compound 37 15 minutes prior to radiation (2 gy/day for 2 days). At day 31 post tumor cell inoculation, tumors were again surgically exposed and measured in 3 dimensions using calipers A significant inhibition of tumor growth was observed in Group 5 treated with 100 mg/kg orally administered Compound 37 + Radiation (tumor volume at end of experiment = 209.04 mm<sup>3</sup>) compared to the control Group 1 (tumor volume at end of experiment = 585.9 mm<sup>3</sup> p&lt;0.01). (Figure 5) Compound 37 at 30 mg/kg in combination with radiation had no significant effect on tumor growth inhibition compared to radiation alone (Figure 5). In addition, 100 mg/kg Compound 37 PO qdx17 alone had no significant effect on tumor growth inhibition compared to vehicle controls (Figure 5). This indicates an enhanced effect when the higher dose of Compound 37 was combined with radiation as opposed to either treatment modality alone.</p>4) Effect of Compound 37 on tumor growth in mice bearing BRCA-1 deficient tumors1x10<sup>6</sup> BRCA-1 null cells were injected subcutaneously on the right flank of female nu/nu mice (6-7 weeks old; Harlan Sprague Dawley, Indianapolis Indiana). After approximately 10-14 days, the tumors were approximately 100 mm<sup>3</sup>. Mice were sorted into groups so that mean tumor size was similar among groups with minimum standard deviations. Dosing started the day after sorting and tumor volume was monitored three times per week. Tumors were measured in two diameters and volume calculated by (1xw)<sup>2</sup>/2. Mice were removed from the study when tumors reached 1500 mm<sup>3</sup>. \"Time to Endpoint\" or TTE (the number of days it takes for the tumor to reach 1500 mm<sup>3</sup> or greater) is the endpoint of the study. Compound 37 was weighed out every 2-3 days and solubilized in sterile bottled water (J.T. Baker, Ultrapure Bioreagent 4221-02) to 10 mg/ml. The compound was dosed orally, daily for 28 days from start of the study - day 1. A positive control was utilized, using a well known PARP inhibitor shown to be effective as a stand alone agent in the BRCA models (Bryant et al). The positive control agent was dosed at 25 mg/kg IP qdx5 from start of experiment. 100 mg/kg Compound 3"
