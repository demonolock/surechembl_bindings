Proceed to KinaseGlo Plus luciferase reaction (see below).</p>Luciferase Reaction:</p>Following the completion of the kinase reaction an equal volume of KinaseGlo or KinaseGlo Plus luciferase reagent (Promega) is added and the luminescence read using a luminescence plate reader within 5-10 minutes. Compound activity is expressed as % inhibition relative to maximal inhibition observed at the maximal dose and IC50 values then calculated using curve fitting software (GraphPad Prizm).</p>F.
