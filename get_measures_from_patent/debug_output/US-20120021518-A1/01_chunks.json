Pathology 143:181-190, 1993).</p>Zvegf4 activity may also be detected using assays designed to measure zvegf4-induced production of one or more additional growth factors or other macromolecules. Such assays include those for determining the presence of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor alpha (TGF\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), VEGF, acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF), and angiogenin. Suitable assays include mitogenesis assays using target cells responsive to the macromolecule of interest, receptor-binding assays, competition binding assays, immunological assays (e.g., ELISA), and other formats known in the art. Metalloprotease secretion is measured from treated primary human dermal fibroblasts, synoviocytes and chondrocytes. The relative levels of collagenase, gelatinase and stromalysin produced in response to culturing in the presence of a zvegf4 protein is measured using zymogram gels (Loita and Stetler-Stevenson, Cancer Biology 1:96-106, 1990). Procollagen/collagen synthesis by dermal fibroblasts and chondrocytes in response to a test protein is measured using <sup>3</sup>H-proline incorporation into nascent secreted collagen. <sup>3</sup>H-labeled collagen is visualized by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography (Unemori and Amento, J. Biol. Chem. 265: 10681-10685, 1990). Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) secretion from dermal fibroblasts and chondrocytes is measured using a 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue dye binding assay (Farndale et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta 883:173-177, 1986). Collagen and GAG assays are also carried out in the presence of IL-1 or TGF-\u03b2 to examine the ability of zvegf4 protein to modify the established responses to these cytokines.</p>Monocyte activation assays are carried out (1) to look for the ability of zvegf4 proteins to further stimulate monocyte activation, and (2) to examine the ability of zvegf4 proteins to modulate attachment-induced or endotoxin-induced monocyte activation (Fuhlbrigge et al., J. Immunol. 138: 3799-3802, 1987). IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 levels produced in response to activation are measured by ELISA (Biosource, Inc. Camarillo, Calif.). Monocyte/macrophage cells, by virtue of CD14 (LPS receptor), are exquisitely sensitive to endotoxin, and proteins with moderate levels of endotoxin-like activity will activate these cells.</p>Hematopoietic activity of zvegf4 proteins can be assayed on various hematopoietic cells in culture. Suitable assays include primary bone marrow or peripheral blood leukocyte colony assays, and later stage lineage-restricted colony assays, which are known in the art (e.g., Holly et al., WIPO Publication WO 95/21920). Marrow cells plated on a suitable semi-solid medium (e.g., 50% methylcellulose containing 15% fetal bovine serum, 10% bovine serum albumin, and 0.6% PSN antibiotic mix) are incubated in the presence of test polypeptide, then examined microscopically for colony formation. Known hematopoietic factors are used as ",
    "per the total number of wells is determined. The titer of the undiluted sample is T=10<sup>(1+F)</sup>=TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml, where F=1+d(S\u22120.5), S is the sum of the ratios (R), and d is Log<sub>10 </sub>of the dilution series (e.g., d=1 for a ten-fold dilution series). To convert TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml to pfu/ml, 0.7 is subtracted from the exponent in the calculation for titer (T).</p>Example 7Recombinant zvegf4 having a carboxyl-terminal Glu-Glu affinity tag was produced in a baculovirus expression system according to conventional methods. The culture was harvested, and the cells were lysed with a solution of 0.02 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM 4-(2-Aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (Pefabloc\u00ae SC; Boehringer-Mannheim), 0.5 \u03bcM aprotinin, 4 mM leupeptin, 4 mM E-64, 1% NP-40 at 4\u00b0 C. for 15 minutes on a rotator. The solution was centrifuged, and the supernatant was recovered. Twenty ml of extract was combined with 50 \u03bcl of anti-Glu-Glu antibody conjugated to Sepharose\u00ae beads in 50 \u03bcl buffer. The mixture was incubated on a rotator at 4\u00b0 C. overnight. The beads were recovered by centrifugation and washed 3\u00d715 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. Pellets were combined with sample buffer containing reducing agent and heated at 98\u00b0 C. for five minutes. The protein was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions followed by western blotting on a PVDF membrane using an antibody to the affinity tag. Two bands were detected, one a M<sub>r</sub>=49 kD and the other at M<sub>r</sub>=21 kD. Sequence analysis showed the larger band to comprise two sequences, one beginning at Arg-19 of SEQ ID NO:2 and the other beginning at Asn-35 of SEQ ID NO:2. The asparagine residue appeared to have been deamidated to an aspartic acid. The smaller band began at Ser-250 of SEQ ID NO:2.</p>Example 8The zvegf4 cDNA was cloned into the EcoRV-AscI sites of a modified pAdTrack-CMV (He et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95:2509-2514, 1998). This construct contains the green fluorescent protein (GFP) marker gene. The CMV promoter driving GFP expression was replaced with the SV40 promoter, and the SV40 polyadenylation signal was replaced with the human growth hormone polyadenylation signal. In addition, the native polylinker was replaced with FseI, EcoRV, and AscI sites. This modified form of pAdTrack-CMV was named pZyTrack. Ligation was performed using a commercially available DNA ligation and screening kit (Fast-Link\u2122 kit; Epicentre Technologies, Madison, Wis.).</p>Zvegf4 was assayed in an aortic ring outgrowth assay (Nicosia and Ottinetti, ibid.; Villaschi and Nicosia, ibid.). Thoracic aortas were isolated from 1-2 month old SD male rats and transferred to petri dishes containing HANK's buffered salt solution. The aortas were flushed with additional HANK's buffered salt solution to remove blood, and adventitial tissue surrounding the aorta was carefully removed. Cleaned aortas were transferred to petri dishes containing EBM basal media, serum free (Clonetics, San Diego, Calif.). ",
    "NO:38), 2 \u03bcl of a density increasing agent and tracking dye (RediLoad, Research Genetics, Inc., Huntsville, Ala.), 0.4 \u03bcl of a commercially available DNA polymerase/antibody mix (50\u00d7 Advantage\u2122 KlenTaq Polymerase Mix, obtained from Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, Calif.), 25 ng of DNA from an individual hybrid clone or control, and x \u03bcl ddH2O for a total volume of 20 \u03bcl. The reaction mixtures were overlaid with an equal amount of mineral oil and sealed. The PCR cycler conditions were an initial 5-minute denaturation at 94\u00b0 C.; 35 cycles of 45 seconds denaturation at 94\u00b0 C., 45 seconds annealing at 64\u00b0 C. and 75 seconds extension at 72\u00b0 C.; followed by a final extension for 7 minutes at 72\u00b0 C. The reaction products were separated by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel. The results showed linkage of zvegf4 to the human chromosome 11 framework marker SHGC-34226 with a LOD score of 14.90 and at a distance of 0 cR<sub>\u2014</sub>10000 from the marker. The use of surrounding genes/markers positions Zvegf4 in the 11q22.3-q23.1 chromosomal region.</p>Example 16The structure of recombinant zvegf4 was analyzed by Western blotting using conventional techniques. Protein produced in the HaCaT human keratinocyte cell line was electrophoresed under reducing and non-reducing conditions, transferred to filters, and probed with antibodies to the interdomain and CUB domain regions of the protein. Reduced protein appeared as a single band having an apparent M<sub>r </sub>of approximately 53 kD, consistent with a glycosylated, monomeric protein. Non-reduced protein appeared as a single band having an apparent M<sub>r </sub>of approximately 85 kD, consistent with a disulfide-linked dimer.</p>Example 17An expression plasmid containing full-length zvegf4 was constructed, using the expression vector pEZE2. pEZE2 is derived from pDC312 by the addition of additional restriction enzyme recognition sites to the multiple cloning site. pDC312 and pEZE2 contain an EASE segment, as described in WO 97/25420, which can improve expression of recombinant proteins two to eight fold in mammalian cells, preferably Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. The pEZE2 expression unit contains the CMV enhancer/promoter, the adenovirus tripartite leader sequence, a multiple cloning site for insertion of the coding region for the recombinant protein, an encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosome entry site, a coding segment for mouse dihydrofolate reductase, and the SV40 transcription terminator. In addition, pEZE2 contains an E. coli origin of replication and a bacterial beta-lactamase gene.</p>A zvegf4 DNA fragment was generated by PCR (ADVANTAGE2 PCR Kit, Clontech, Palo Alto, Calif.) with 5\u2032 FseI and 3\u2032 AscI sites for direct cloning into the expression vector. The 5\u2032 primer contained an FseI site, Kozak sequence, and the first 21 basepairs of the native leader sequence for zvegf4 (ZC26,136; SEQ ID NO:43). The 3\u2032 primer contained the last 21 basepairs of zvegf4, a stop codon, and an AscI site (ZC26,137; SEQ ID NO:44). The PCR reaction included 1 \u03bcL of template (ESTEP plasmid zvegf4 perfl#3) and was run as follows: 94\u00b0 C., 1 minute, 1 cycle; "
