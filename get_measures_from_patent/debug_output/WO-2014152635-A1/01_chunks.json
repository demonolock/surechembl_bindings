The treatment often lasts for 24-48 weeks, depending on hepatitis C virus genotype. Ot",

Combination of Compound 1 and Compound 2 In Vitro </p> [0078] Figure 7 shows that the combination of Compound 1 and Compound 2 exhibits significant synergistic effect on HCV inhibition as tested in HCV GT lb Con-1 replication cells. The result was generated using Prichard and Shipman model (Prichard et al. ANTIVIRAL RESEARCH 14: 181-205 (1990)). </p>[0079] Compound 1 inhibited replication of HCV stable subgenomic replicons containing NS3 genes from GT la, lb, 2a, 3a, 4a, or 6a with EC<sub>5</sub>o values ranging from 0.85 to 2.8 nM. Of note, Compound 1 \n\n was potent against replicon containing GT3a protease, with an EC<sub>5</sub>o value of 1.6 nM. Compound 1 retained its activity against common GTl a and lb variants at NS3 amino acid positions 155 and 168 that conferred resistance to other HCV protease inhibitors (Pis). Resistant colony selection studies in GTl a and lb subgenomic replicon cells identified A156T in GTl a and A156V in GTlb as the most frequent variants, which conferred 1400- and 1800-fold reduced susceptibility to Compound 1 , respectively. However, these variants had in vitro replication capacities of only 1.5% and 9.2% that of their corresponding wild-type replicons. In a replicon containing GT3a NS3 protease, Compound 1 selected very few colonies at concentrations &gt; 100-fold over its EC50 value. The colonies that survived the selection contained either A156G alone, or Q 168R co-selected with Y56H, which conferred 1500- or 1 100-fold loss in susceptibility to Compound 1 , respectively. </p>Table 2.

Compound 1 was also shown to have potent activity against many NS5A inhibitor and NS5B inhibitor resistance-associated"
