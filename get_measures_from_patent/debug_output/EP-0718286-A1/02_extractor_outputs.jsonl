{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that meet the specified criteria. The text does not contain specific molecule names, IDs, or identifiers along with bioactivity metrics (IC50, Ki, Kd, EC50) and their corresponding numeric values with units."}
{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n1. Compounds with an IC50 value less than 250 nM are termed active within the context of the present invention.\n2. specific activity (8.8 x 10<sup>-12</sup> mM) \n\nNote that there are only two sentences that contain all four required components: a specific molecule identifier is not explicitly mentioned, but \"compounds\" in general is mentioned in sentence 1, and \"specific activity\" is mentioned in sentence 2, which could be related to a molecule. However, sentence 2 does not contain a bioactivity metric like IC50, Ki, Kd, or EC50, but rather \"specific activity\" which might be related to a molecule's activity. Sentence 1 does contain the IC50 metric, a numeric value, and a unit, but lacks a specific molecule identifier. \n\nIf you would like to include sentences with implied or related information, I can try to provide more context. However, based on the strict criteria provided, the above two sentences are the most relevant."}
