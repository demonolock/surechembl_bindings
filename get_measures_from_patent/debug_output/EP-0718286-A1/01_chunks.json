    ". Process # 3 entails the reaction of intermediates VI with either an alkyl isocyanate or isothiocyanate to afford urea or thiourea derivatives of Formula I wherein R<sup>1</sup> is lower alkyl substituted amino and X is oxygen or sulfur respectively.</p>Reagents, solvents and reaction conditions for the above described preparative steps would be known to one skilled in the art of organic synthesis as all the steps are standard organic reactions having extensive precedent in the chemical literature.</p>These preparative methods may be varied in order to produce other compounds embraced by this invention but not specifically disclosed.</p>Additionally compounds of Formula I also encompass all pharmaceutically acceptable solvates, hydrates being the preferred solvates. The present invention also includes stereoisomers as well as optical isomers, e.g. mixtures of enantiomers as well as individual enantiomers and diastereomers, which arise as a consequence of structural asymmetry in certain compounds of the instant series. Separation of the individual isomers is accomplished by application of various methods which are well known to practitioners of the art.</p>The \"Description of Specific Embodiments\" section hereinbelow provides greater descriptive details of the synthesis of compounds of Formula I and of intermediates of Formulas IV-VI.</p>The compounds of the present invention have affinity for receptors of the endogenous pineal hormone, melatonin, as determined in a receptor binding assay, and exhibit partial agonist activity as determined by a functional assay; the biological tests are described hereinbelow. As has been discussed above, melatonin is involved in the regulation of a variety of biological rhythms and exerts its biological effects via interaction with specific receptors. There is evidence that administration of melatonin agonists are of clinical utility in the treatment of various conditions regulated by melatonin activity. Such conditions include depression, jet-lag, work-shift syndrome, sleep disorders, glaucoma, some disorders associated with reproduction, cancer, immune disorders and neuroendocrine disorders.</p>The systemic administration and dosing regimen of compounds of Formula I can be considered to be done in a manner similar to that described for melatonin itself. The dosage and dosage regimen must be adjusted using sound professional judgment and taking into consideration such variables as the age, body weight, sex and physical condition of the recipient, the route of administration and the nature of the illness being treated. Oral, transdermal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, rectal, buccal, intranasal, and ocular routes of administrations may be used.</p>One or more of the compounds of the invention is mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable amounts of one or more conventional pharmaceutical excipients to produce a formulation to be administered by the desired route. Generally, such formulations will contain o",

Tissue preparation. Male New Zealand white rabbits (Hazelton Research) are decapitated, the brains are rapidly removed and chilled. The parietal cortex is crudely dissected and frozen on dry ice with tissue stored at -80\u00b0C until assayed. Tissue is weighed and thawed in 20 mls ice cold Tris buffer (a) and homogenized by treatment with a polytron for 10 seconds at setting 17. Ice cold Tris (a) is added to a volume of 40 mls. The homogenate is centrifuged in a Sorvall-SS-34 head at 19,000 rpm (44,000 x g) for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. The resulting supernatant is decanted and discarded. The pellet is rehomogenized in an additional 20 mls of Tris, diluted and centrifuged as before. The supernatant is decanted and discarded. The resulting pellet is homogenized in 20 volumes of Tris per gram of original tissue (a 1:20 homogenate), chilled, and held on ice until assayed.3.

Incubation: 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. Reaction is terminated by filtration through a Brandel cell harvester. Filters are washed 3 times.5. Activity: Compounds with an IC50 value less than 250 nM are termed active within the context of the present invention.6.
