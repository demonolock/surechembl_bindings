Sulfated oligosaccharides dextran sulfate (fig. 9C) and pentosan sulfate (fig. 9F) bind directly to PCSK9 with affinity of 179.5 μΜ and 381.3 μΜ, respectively, as determined using MST and resulted in a dose-dependent increase in cellular LDLR (fig. 9A-B and 9D-E), reaching a plateau of about 400% compared to vehicle controls and being significantly better than the maximal effect of statins in this assay.\n2. The interaction was dependent on the presence of sulfate groups, as non-sulfated dextran showed no affinity for PCSK 9, and sulfated naphthalene derivative suramin, an antiparasitic in African sleeping sickness (African sleeping sickness), bound to PCSK9 with an affinity of 190 μΜ (fig. 9H) resulting in up to fifteen-fold increase in LDLR (fig. 9A, 9G) with increased cellular uptake of fluorescently labeled LDL particles (fig. 12).\n3. We further tested 36-mer single-stranded DNA molecules and found that they bound PCSK9 with a KD of 4.8 μΜ (fig. 9K) and showed strong inhibition over this concentration range (fig. 9I-J)."
