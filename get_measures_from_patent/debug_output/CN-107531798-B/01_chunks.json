    "are statins. Statins inhibit cholesterol synthesis and up-regulate LDLR expression, thus leading to a decrease in the amount of circulating LDL cholesterol overall. However, due to a variety of side effects, a significant number of patients do not respond or tolerate statins. In addition, statins also increase expression of type 9 proprotein convertase subtilisin-like/kexin (PCSK9), recently identified as a potent negative regulator of LDLR (Seidah et al, 2014), thereby counteracting the beneficial effects on LDL cholesterol.</p><p id=\"p0006\" num=\"0004\">Targeting of PCSK9 is a recent strategy for lowering plasma LDL-C (Lagace et al, 2006). Cellular levels of LDLR are reduced due to the ability of PCSK9 to bind to LDLR, thereby impairing recycling and enhancing lysosomal degradation of the receptor. The PCSK9 functional gain mutation results in a significant increase in circulating LDL-C due to increased degradation of LDLR. In contrast, individuals with PCSK9 loss-of-function mutations showed decreased LDL-C levels and exhibited fewer events in coronary heart disease. Several leading pharmaceutical companies have obtained approval for therapeutic strategies targeting PCSK9 for the relief of hypercholesterolemia. Administration of PCSK 9-specific antibodies directed against the LDLR binding site of PCSK9 was reported to reduce LDL-C plasma levels in a phase III clinical trial (Mullard (2015) Nat Rev Drug Discov; sheeridan (2015) Nature Biotechnology). However, PCSK9: the LDLR binding constant is in the range of 120-620nM (Cunningham et al, 2007; Fisher et al, 2007), whereas PCSK9 plasma concentrations are about 6nM (Lakoski et al, 2009), which makes direct binding of LDLR by PCSK9 at physiologically relevant concentrations highly unlikely. Furthermore, PCSK9 only targets LDLR in the liver, but not in steroid hormone producing tissues (which also express high levels of LDLR), suggesting the need for liver-specific co-receptors (Seidah et al, 2014). Therefore, LDLR is most likely not the primary PCSK9 receptor. In contrast, the unknown receptor (receptor X) can capture circulating PCSK9 and subsequently deliver it to the LDLR. Therefore, inhibition of PCSK9 binding to this receptor is a superior strategy compared to inhibition of PCSK9: LDLR interaction.</p></background-art><disclosure><p id=\"p0007\">Disclosure of Invention</p><p id=\"p0008\" num=\"0005\">The present invention relates to the following findings: LDLR is not the only PCSK9 receptor on the surface of hepatocytes. The present inventors found that PCSK9 carries a binding motif for Heparan Sulphate Proteoglycans (HSPGs). The mutations introduced in this motif and the inhibition of binding to HSPGs by heparin surprisingly protect the LDLR from PCSK 9-induced degradation. Inhibition of the interaction between PCSK9 and HSPGs has superior therapeutic potential compared to clinical trials of PCSK9 inhibitory antibodies (Chan et al, 2009). Importantly, the HSPG binding motif in PCSK9 is distinct fr",

PCSK9 was labeled using the MO-L003Monolith Blue-NHS labeling kit (NanoTemper Technologies) and a 1:1 molar ratio of protein to dye labeling efficiency was achieved. PCSK9 was administered at a final concentration of 100 nM. Unlabeled binding partner was titrated in a 1:1 dilution (in PBS + 0.05% Tween-20) with a maximum concentration of suramin of 15.4mM, dextran sulfate of 2.3mM, dextran 5000 of 2.3mM, pentosan sulfate of 16.3mM, and S-dC-36 of 250. mu.M. MST measurements were performed on a Monolith nt.115 instrument (NanoTemper Technologies) in standard treated capillaries (NanoTemper Technologies) using 20% LED and 80% MST power. The laser turn-on and turn-off times were 5 seconds and 35 seconds, respectively. Negative controls were performed in all 16 capillaries using 100nM labeled PCSK9 in MST buffer under the same conditions as above. A temperature ramp-up phase from suramin, dextran sulfate 5000, and 80% MST power of S-dC-36; and binding curves were obtained from the thermophoresis + temperature jump phase at 80% MST power of pentosan sulphate. For each binding partner, a sigmoidal dose-response curve was fitted with GraphPad Prism 6 to obtain the mean KD values. Fluorescence quenching of PCSK9 was observed in the presence of high concentrations of suramin, and denaturation tests were performed by pre-treating PCSK9 with 10% SDS followed by heating the sample at 90 \u2103 for 15 minutes, and then analysis was performed on an MST instrument. This eliminates the quenching effect, indicating that fluorescence quenching of PCSK9 under non-denaturing conditions is due to an actual ligand binding event.</p><p id=\"p0359\" num=\"0355\">Sulfated oligosaccharides dextran sulfate (fig. 9C) and pentosan sulfate (fig. 9F) bind directly to PCSK9 with affinity of 179.5 \u03bc \u039c and 381.3 \u03bc \u039c, respectively, as determined using MST and resulted in a dose-dependent increase in cellular LDLR (fig. 9A-B and 9D-E), reaching a plateau of about 400% compared to vehicle controls and being significantly better than the maximal effect of statins in this assay. The interaction was dependent on the presence of sulfate groups, as non-sulfated dextran showed no affinity for PCSK 9. Sulfated naphthalene derivative suramin, an antiparasitic in African sleeping sickness (African sleeping sickness), bound to PCSK9 with an affinity of 190 \u03bc \u039c (fig. 9H) resulting in up to fifteen-fold increase in LDLR (fig. 9A, 9G) with increased cellular uptake of fluorescently labeled LDL particles (fig. 12).
