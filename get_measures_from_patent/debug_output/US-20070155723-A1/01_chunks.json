The cells were grown in T-180 cell culture flasks under standard cell culture conditions at 37\u00b0 C. in a 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere. The cells were harvested by trysinization and homogenized in a homogenization buffer (10 mM Tris, 0.2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM KCl, with protease inhibitors aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin A and bacitracin) and centrifuged (2000 g). The supernatant was then centrifuged in 2M sucrose (31,300 g) to produce a semi-purified membrane pellet. The pellet was resuspended in homogenization and store at \u221280\u00b0 C. </p> On the day of the assay, the pellet was thawed on ice and diluted in assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mg/mL fatty acid free bovine serum albumin, pH 7.5). The diluted membrane was added with buffer, test compound or standard and the radioligand [H]<sup>3+</sup>-CP-55,940_(0.2 nM) to the wells of a 96-well polypropylene plate. Non-specific binding was measured in wells containing 10 uM WIN 55,212. The plate was covered and incubated for 90 minutes at 30\u00b0 C. The contents were then aspirated onto a Packard Unifilter GF/C filter bottom plate prewet with 0.5% polyethyleneimine. The wells of the polypropylene plate were rinsed and aspirated seven times with a 0.9% saline-0.5% Tween 20 solution. The Unifilter plate was d"
