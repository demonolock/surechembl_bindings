    "mbination of both approaches. An alternative approach, \u201calanine scan,\u201d involves the random replacement of residues throughout molecule with alanine, and the resulting affect on function determined.</p>It also is possible to solve the crystal structure of the specific antibodies. In principle, this approach yields a pharmacore upon which subsequent drug design can be based. It is possible to bypass protein crystallography altogether by generating anti-idiotypic antibodies to a functional, pharmacologically active antibody. As a mirror image of a mirror image, the binding site of anti-idiotype would be expected to be an analog of the original antigen. The anti-idiotype could then be used to identify and isolate additional antibodies from banks of chemically- or biologically-produced peptides.</p>Chemically constructed bispecific antibodies may be prepared by chemically cross-linking heterologous Fab or F(ab\u2032)<sub>2 </sub>fragments by means of chemicals such as heterobifunctional reagent succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithiol)-propionate (SPDP, Pierce Chemicals, Rockford, Ill.). The Fab and F(ab\u2032)<sub>2 </sub>fragments can be obtained from intact antibody by digesting it with papain or pepsin, respectively (Karpovsky et al., J. Exp. Med. 160:1686-701, 1984; Titus et al., J. Immunol., 138:4018-22, 1987).</p>Methods of testing antibodies for the ability to bind to the epitope of the EGFR regardless of how the antibodies are produced are known in the art and include any antibody-antigen binding assay, such as, for example, radioimmunoassay (RIA), ELISA, Western blot, immunoprecipitation, and competitive inhibition assays (see, e.g., Janeway et al., infra, and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002/0197266 A1).</p>Aptamers</p>In some embodiments, the compound that inhibits a binding interaction between EGFR and HSP90 is an analog of an antibody. In some aspects, the compound is an aptamer. Recent advances in the field of combinatorial sciences have identified short polymer sequences (e.g., oligonucleic acid or peptide molecules) with high affinity and specificity to a given target. For example, SELEX technology has been used to identify DNA and RNA aptamers with binding properties that rival mammalian antibodies, the field of immunology has generated and isolated antibodies or antibody fragments which bind to a myriad of compounds and phage display has been utilized to discover new peptide sequences with very favorable binding properties. Based on the success of these molecular evolution techniques, it is certain that molecules can be created which bind to any target molecule. A loop structure is often involved with providing the desired binding attributes as in the case of: aptamers which often utilize hairpin loops created from short regions without complimentary base pairing, naturally derived antibodies that utilize combinatorial arrangement of looped hyper-variable regions and new phage display libraries utilizing cyclic peptides that have shown im",

As used herein, polyethylene glycol is meant to encompass any of the forms of PEG that can be used to derivatize other proteins, such as mono-(C1-C10) alkoxy- or aryloxy-polyethylene glycol. PEG is a linear or branched neutral polyether, available in a broad range of molecular weights, and is soluble in water and most organic solvents. PEG is effective at excluding other polymers or peptides when present in water, primarily through its high dynamic chain mobility and hydrophibic nature, thus creating a water shell or hydration sphere when attached to other proteins or polymer surfaces. PEG is nontoxic, non-immunogenic, and approved by the Food and Drug Administration for internal consumption.</p>Proteins or enzymes when conjugated to PEG have demonstrated bioactivity, non-antigenic properties, and decreased clearance rates when administered in animals.

About 200 ng purified HSP90 protein (Cat # SPP-770, Assay Designs) was then added to the washed beads and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0 C. The beads were washed three times using 0.5 Superdex buffer, boiled in Laemmli buffer, and the bound HSP90-EGFR complex was immunodetected following immunoblotting with HSP90 and EGFR specific antibodies.</p>Peptide Internalization Assay</p>The UMSCC1 xenografts were cryopreserved in OCT (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Five \u03bcm sections were cut from tissues prepared on days 1 and 3 after peptide treatment. Sections were fixed in cold methanol for 20 min and then were blocked with 1% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA). The sections were incubated overnight with anti-EGFR antibody (Santa Cruz). After washing, the sections were incubated with anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes) and Streptavidin conjugated Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes). Coverslips were mounted with one drop of Prolong Gold anti-fade reagent with DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Molecular Probes) to visualize the nuclei. Fluorescence images were acquired using a DP70 camera fitted on an Olympus 1X-71 microscope.</p>Peptide Binding Assay</p>UMSCC1 cells (1\u00d710<sup>6</sup>) were scraped in PBS containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors, then frozen and thawed three times using dry ice. Next, supernatant was collected and incubated with 3 or 10 \u03bcg/ml of biotinylated peptide for 1 hour at 37\u00b0 C., followed by the addition of 20 \u03bcl of Streptavidin agarose beads (EZview red Streptavidin affinity gel, Sigma). Samples were rotated overnight at 4\u00b0 C., boiled in 30 \u03bcl of Laemmli buffer at 100\u00b0 C. for 10 minutes, and immunoblotted for HSP90 to detect binding with peptide.</p>ATP Binding Assay</p>Cell lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer. About 500 \u03bcg protein was incubated overnight at 4\u00b0 C. with 25 \u03bcl of \u03b3-linked ATP-Agarose beads (Innova Biosciences). After centrifugation, beads were washed in PBS 6 times and ATP bound proteins were extracted in Laemilli buffer, resolved on a SDS page and immunoblotted with anti-HSP90 antibody to detect change in ATP bound HSP90 levels.</p>In Vivo Tumor Growth Studies</p>Mice were handled according to the established procedures of the University of Michigan Laboratory Animals Maintenance Manual. To generate tumor xenografts, 2\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>UMSCC1 cells were transplanted into the flanks of athymic nude Foxn1<sup>nu </sup>mice (Harlan Laboratories). When tumors reached a volume of \u02dc50 mm<sup>3</sup>, the mice were randomized into 3 groups (1 untreated control and 2 experimental groups for specific and non-specific peptides) containing from 15 to 25 tumors, and treatment was initiated.</p>Live Cell Imaging to Monitor Autophagy:</p>Change in LC3 localization upon EGFR degradation after treatment with peptide was monitored in live HeLa cells that were stably expressing LC3B-GFP construct. LC3-I is converted to LC3-II during autophagy, and causes the autophagosomes to appear as punctate spots using a fluorescent microscope. HeLa-LC3-GFP cells were plated in optically clear multi-chamber slides. After overnight incubation with cell permeable peptide, change in LC3 expression was monitored. Chloroquine (8 \u03bcM) which stabil",
    "ribed for the UMSCC1 xenograft mice above was initiated except that the NCI-H1975 bearing animals were also treated daily with erlotinib (100 mg/kg, p.o., one week). As shown in FIG. 11a-c, Disruptin also increased tumor doubling time in the NCI-H1975 bearing animals.</p>Example 3To assess the efficacy of a peptide of the present disclosures against tumors expressing either wild-type or erlotinib-resistant EGFR, grown as xenografts, four different cell lines that contain either WT or mutant EGFR are implanted into the mice of a treatment group (10 mice per group) to produce xenografts. A total of 160 mice are used (4 cell lines\u00d74 treatment groups\u00d710 mice per group). Each mouse is prepared with two tumors. Once the tumor has reached about 100 mm<sup>3</sup>, mice are randomized into 4 groups containing at least 10 animals per group. Mice are then given (a) specific peptide (8 mg/kg, ip, day 1 and 3) (b) non-specific peptide (same as specific peptide), (c) erlotinib (80 mg/kg, oral, 5 doses), (d) DMSO (same as specific peptide). Three mice are sacrificed to take out 6 tumors on day 3 and 6 tumors on day 18 to assess the effect on EGFR-HSP90 interaction by immunoprecipitation and on EGFR degradation by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analysis of EGFR and key down-stream signaling molecules, such as pAKT, pERK1/2 (as described previously (Nyati et al., Clin Cancer Res 10: 691-700 (2004)). The effect of treatment on apoptosis and cell proliferation are assessed by TUNEL and Ki-67 staining. The remaining tumors are monitored for growth for 60 days or until tumors have reached a maximum of 1 cm\u00d71 cm.</p>The median growth rate or time to doubling for each cell line in each treatment is determined. Linear contrasts are used to test the effect of treatment on growth rates overall, and within cell line types. Cox proportional hazards regression models are utilized to test for differences in doubling times while allowing inclusion of data from tumors removed on days 3 and 18 (censored if volume not doubled at time of removal). Treatment, cell line and their interaction are included as covariates. An overall comparison between two treatment groups is obtained by stratifying the analysis on cell line. Pairwise comparisons of particular interest include peptide vs. control, peptide+cisplatin vs. cisplatin and peptide+cisplatin vs. peptide.</p>Example 4To assess the efficacy and mechanism of EGFR degradation induced by treatment with a compound of the present disclosures, and the role of this treatment in chemo and radiosensitivity, two cell lines from Example 3 are selected: one that expresses WT-EGFR and second that expresses T790M-EGFR for combination studies. Mice are prepared as described in Example 3 and are given a combination treatment wherein either a control peptide or a peptide compound of the present disclosures are administered followed by a single dose of cisplatin (5 mg/kg), or 5 radiation treatments (i.e. Mon-Fri, 2Gy per fraction).
