A.-R et al, 1996 Blood 87:3545-3549), the pH or other components of the alpha-granules, or, more likely, most of the PAI-1 was degraded by the u-PA. </p> Aside from peripartum deaths, adult transgenic mice had few spontaneous mucosal bleeding episodes, had normal bleeding times, and exhibited normal platelet aggregation in vitro. However, these animals clearly were resistant to developing occlusive thrombi in a ferric chloride-induced carotid artery thrombosis model. Only 5% of the u-PA expressing animals developed complete arterial occlusion by the end of the study (60 minutes) as opposed to 85% of their wildtype littermates (Table 1). It appears that the thrombi that did form were far more friable and transitory in nature. Moreover, lysis of preformed, fibrin microemboli targeted to the lungs occurred far more rapidly in the u-PA expressing mice than in their wildtype counterparts. These data suggest that platelet activation initiated by fibrin contributes to thrombus growth or stability on the venous side of the circulation (Bdeir, K. et al, cited above) and that local release of u-PA causes rapid lysis of the nascent thrombi. </p> Recent studies using combined platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors and agents (Murciano, J. C. et al, 2002 Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 282:L529-539), and studies using pharmacological inhibition of PAI-1 (Rupin, A. et al, 2001 Thromb. Haemost. 86:1528-1531) are consistent with these conclusions. </p> Transfusion of u-PA platelets equivalent to 10% of the recipient's platelet mass potently inhibited thrombus development in wildtype recipients. The ability of the transgenic platelets to disrupt thrombus development is more likely to be due to the released u-PA than to degradation of hemostatic alpha-granular proteins for several reasons. First, the near total loss of granular proteins, as in the Gray Platelet Disorder, is associated with little or no bleeding (Rao, A. K, 1998 Am. J. Med. Sci. 316:69-76, 1998). Second, arterial thrombi are enriched with PAI-1. The absence of PAI-1 in mice results in a failure of thrombus formation in a chemically-induced carotid artery thrombosis model (Eitzman, D. T. et al, 2000 Blood 95:577-580). Third, transfusion of transgenic platelets into wildtype recipients that had been drinking water containing tranexamic acid reversed the effect of platelet-associated u-PA on thrombus formation (Table 2), notwithstanding the persistence of degraded alpha-granular proteins in the transfused platelets. These results suggest that it is the u-PA that is the major cause for the defective hemostasis in these mice, although a contribution from degraded alpha-granular proteins is by no means excluded. </p> Based on an analysis of the data generated by these examples similar to that of (Kahr, W. H. et al., cited above), line #19 platelets w",
    "by peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (StreptABComplex/HRP, DAKO, Carpinteria, Calif.). Murine vWF was detected using a 1:200 dilution of a horse radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated rabbit anti-human vWF polyclonal antibody (DAKO), and murine fibrinogen was detected using a 1:100 dilution of an HRP-conjugated goat anti-human fibrinogen polyclonal antibody (Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, Pa.). </p> The Western blot of platelet lysates (10 \u03bcg/lane) for lines # 19 and # 13, wildtype, and renal extract (30 \u03bcg/lane) revealed a major doublet at \u02dc45 kDa in line #19; total platelet lysate that was not seen in wildtype littermate platelet lysate (data not shown). The major component in the doublet appears to be tcu-PA and co-migrates with the renal extract control. The higher, less intense band is likely to be single chain uPA (scu-PA) or an otherwise modified tcu-PA as previously described (Franco, P. et al, 1997 J. Cell Biol. 137:779-791) and migrates similar to a band in renal extract. Thus, as with QPD platelet lysates, the major form of u-PA in the transgenic platelets appears to be tcu-PA (Kahr, W. H. et al., cited above). </p> Also, as with QPD platelet lysates, a few high molecular weight species were observed that likely include covalent complexes between PAI-1 and both tcu-PA and low molecular weight proteolytic derivatives of u-PA (Jiang, Y et al. 1996 Blood 87:2775-2781). The typical low molecular weight u-PA species commonly observed in biological specimens (\u02dc30 kD), was not a feature of platelet lysates. Rather, as observed with QPD platelets, a somewhat smaller low molecular weight u-PA species was observed in transgenic mouse platelet lysates. None of these mouse u-PA bands was detected when a comparable amount of platelet lysate from wildtype and line # 13 mice were studied. This lack of detectable u-PA in Line #13 is consistent with the lack of u-PA activity seen in the above-described zymogram and in the clinical course of these animals (discussed below). </p>EXAMPLE 5 Alpha-Granular Proteins  Several alpha-granular proteins, including vWF, fibrinogen and Factor V undergo proteolysis in QPD platelets. Proteolysis of these proteins has been attributed to the ectopically expressed u-PA (Kahr, W. H. et al., cited above). To determine whether the presence of mouse u-PA in platelets led to a similar expression of proteolytic activity and study the in vitro digestion of Factor V by platelet lysate, 10 ng of plasma-derived human Factor V (Rodney Camire, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia) was digested with either human tcu-PA (10 pg, American Diagnostica) or with 2.5 \u03bcg of total murine platelet lysate prepared from 1.3\u00d710<sup>6</sup>/\u03bcl platelets in the presence or absence of supplemental plasminogen (1 \u03bcg). The resultant digest was then separated by SDS-PAGE. Factor V was detected using a 1:100 dilution of an HRP-conjugated sheep anti-human Factor V polyclonal antibody (Affinity Biologicals, Inc., Hamilton, ON, Canada) as the primar"
