    "nd \n\nreplaced with a signal sequence from another protein. In certain host cells (e.g., mammalian host cells), expression and/or secretion of TANGO-175 can be increased through use of a heterologous signal sequence. For example, the gp67 secretory sequence of the baculovirus envelope protein can be used as a heterologous signal sequence { Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Ausubel et al . , eds., John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1992) . Other examples of eukaryotic heterologous signal sequences include the secretory sequences of melittin and human placental alkaline phosphatase (Stratagene; La Jolla, California) . In yet another example, useful prokaryotic heterologous signal sequences include the phoA secretory signal (Molecular cloning, Sambrook et al . , supra) and the protein A secretory signal (Pharmacia Biotech; Piscataway, New Jersey) .</p>In yet another embodiment, the fusion protein is an TANGO- 175-immunoglobulin fusion protein in which all or part of TANGO-175 is fused to sequences derived from a member of the immunoglobulin protein family. The TANGO- 175-immunoglobulin fusion proteins of the invention can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions and administered to a subject to inhibit an interaction between a TANGO-175 ligand and a TANGO-175 protein on the surface of a cell, to thereby suppress TANGO-175-mediated signal transduction in vivo . The TANGO-175- immunoglobulin fusion proteins can be used to affect the bioavailability of a TANGO-175 cognate ligand. Inhibition of the TANGO-175 ligand/TANGO-175 interaction may be useful therapeutically for both the treatment of proliferative and differentiative disorders, as well as for modulating (e.g. promoting or inhibiting) cell survival. Moreover, the TANGO- 175-immunoglobulin fusion proteins of the invention can be used as immunogens to produce anti-TANGO-175 antibodies in a subject, to purify \n\nTANGO-175 ligands and in screening assays to identify molecules which inhibit the interaction of TANGO-175 with a TANGO-175 ligand.</p>Preferably, a TANGO-175 chimeric or fusion protein of the invention is produced by standard recombinant DNA techniques. For example, DNA fragments coding for the different polypeptide sequences are ligated together in- frame in accordance with conventional techniques, for example by employing blunt-ended or stagger-ended termini for ligation, restriction enzyme digestion to provide for appropriate termini, filling-in of cohesive ends as appropriate, alkaline phosphatase treatment to avoid undesirable joining, and enzymatic ligation. In another embodiment, the fusion gene can be synthesized by conventional techniques including automated DNA synthesizers. Alternatively, PCR amplification of gene fragments can be carried out using anchor primers which give rise to complementary overhangs between two consecutive gene fragments which can subsequently be annealed and reamplified to generate a chimeric gene sequence ( see, e . g. , Current Protocols in Molecular Bio",
    "nic preparation of the present invention with an immortalized mouse cell line, e.g., a myeloma cell line that is sensitive to culture medium containing hypoxanthine , aminopterin and thymidine (\"HAT medium\") . Any of a number of myeloma cell lines can be used as a fusion partner according to standard techniques, e.g., the P3- NSl/l-Ag4-l, P3 -x63 -Ag8.653 or Sp2/0-Agl4 myeloma lines. These myeloma lines are available from ATCC. Typically, HAT-sensitive mouse myeloma cells are fused to mouse splenocytes using polyethylene glycol (\"PEG\") . Hybridoma cells resulting from the fusion are then selected using HAT medium, which kills unfused and unproductively fused myeloma cells (unfused splenocytes die after several days because they are not transformed) . Hybridoma cells producing a monoclonal antibody of the invention are detected by screening the hybridoma culture supernatants for antibodies that bind TANGO-175, e.g., using a standard ELISA assay.</p>Alternative to preparing monoclonal antibody- secreting hybridomas, a monoclonal anti-TANGO-175 antibody can be identified and isolated by screening a recombinant combinatorial immunoglobulin library (e.g., an antibody phage display library) with TANGO-175 to thereby isolate immunoglobulin library members that bind TANGO-175. Kits for generating and screening phage display libraries are commercially available (e.g., the Pharmacia Recombinant Phage Antibody System, Catalog No. 27-9400-01; and the Stratagene Surf ZAP\u2122 Phage Display \n\nKi t, Catalog No. 240612) . Additionally, examples of methods and reagents particularly amenable for use in generating and screening antibody display library can be found in, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,223,409; PCT Publication No. WO 92/18619; PCT Publication No. WO 91/17271; PCT Publication No. WO 92/20791; PCT Publication No. WO 92/15679; PCT Publication No. WO 93/01288; PCT Publication No. WO 92/01047; PCT Publication No. WO 92/09690; PCT Publication No. WO 90/02809; Fuchs et al .

(1993) EMBO J. 12:725-734.</p>Additionally, recombinant anti-TANGO-175 antibodies, such as chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies, comprising both human and non-human portions, which can be made using standard recombinant DNA techniques, are within the scope of the invention. Such chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies can be produced by recombinant DNA techniques known in the art, for example using methods described in PCT Publication No. WO 87/02671; European Patent Application 184,187; European Patent Application 171,496; European Patent Application 173,494; PCT Publication No. WO 86/01533; U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567; European Patent Application 125,023; Better et al .

    "cule. In one embodiment, the agent stimulates \n\none or more of the biological activities of TANGO-175 protein. Examples of such stimulatory agents include active TANGO-175 protein and a nucleic acid molecule encoding TANGO-175 that has been introduced into the cell. In another embodiment, the agent inhibits one or more of the biological activities of TANGO-175 protein. Examples of such inhibitory agents include antisense TANGO-175 nucleic acid molecules and anti-TANGO-175 antibodies. These modulatory methods can be performed in vitro (e.g., by culturing the cell with the agent) or, alternatively, in vivo (e.g, by administering the agent to a subject) . As such, the present invention provides methods of treating an individual afflicted with a disease or disorder characterized by aberrant expression or activity of a TANGO-175 protein or nucleic acid molecule. In one embodiment, the method involves administering an agent (e.g., an agent identified by a screening assay described herein) , or combination of agents that modulates (e.g., upregulates or downregulates) TANGO-175 expression or activity. In another embodiment, the method involves administering a TANGO-175 protein or nucleic acid molecule as therapy to compensate for reduced or aberrant TANGO-175 expression or activity. Stimulation of TANGO-175 activity is desirable in situations in which TANGO-175 is abnormally downregulated and/or in which increased TANGO-175 activity is likely to have a beneficial effect. Conversely, inhibition of TANGO-175 activity is desirable in situations in which TANGO-175 is abnormally upregulated and/or in which decreased TANGO-175 activity is likely to have a beneficial effect.</p>This invention is further illustrated by the following examples which should not be construed as limiting.

The bone marrow cells were obtained from the femurs of adult C57BL/6 female mice following the procedure of StemCell Technologies, Inc. (StemCell Technologies, Inc., Vancouver, Canada) with minor changes. Briefly, bone marrow was flushed from the femurs using phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, supplemented with 5% heat- inactivated fetal calf serum (PBS/5% HIFCS) . After creating a single cell suspension by repetitive pipetting of the bone marrow, the cells were washed once in PBS/5% HIFCS, and the red blood cells were lysed by incubation with 3M ammonium chloride for 3 minutes on ice. Following termination of lysis by addition of PBS/5%</p>HIFCS, the bone marrow cells were washed once more with PBS/5% HIFCS and plated at 8 x 10<sup>7</sup> cells/20ml/75cm<sup>2</sup> flask in murine myeloid lon"
