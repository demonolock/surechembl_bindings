    "sed herein \u201ca neurodegenerative disease\u201d refers to a disorder, disease or condition of the nervous system (preferably CNS) which is characterized by gradual and progressive loss of neural tissue, neurotransmitter, or neural functions.</p>Examples of neurodegenerative disorder include, but are not limited to, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig's Disease), autoimmune encephalomyelitis, degenerative nerve diseases, encephalitis (e.g. Rasmussen's encephalitis), Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, genetic brain disorders, stroke, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease.</p>According to a specific embodiment, the neurodegenerative disease comprises an Alzheimer's disease.</p>As used herein \u201can insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) inhibitor\u201d refers to a molecule that reduces the activity or expression of IDE (i.e. comprises an IDE inhibitory activity).</p>As used herein \u201can insulin degrading enzyme (IDE)\u201d refers to the insulysin or insulin protease, a large zinc-binding protease of the M16A metalloprotease subfamily which is involved in the cellular processing of multiple short polypeptides including amyloid \u03b2-protein (A\u03b2), insulin, glucagon, amylin, atrial natriuretic factor and calcitonin (e.g., as set forth in GenBank Accession Nos. NM<sub>\u2014</sub>004969 and NP<sub>\u2014</sub>004960). An exemplary IDE of the present invention is set forth in EC 3.4.24.56.</p>The IDE inhibitor of the present teachings specifically down-regulates the enzymatic activity of IDE. For instance, the IC50 of IDE is in the range of 10-200 nM as assayed for ADT-21. According to exemplary embodiments, the IDE inhibitor of the present invention is capable of down-regulating by at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90% or at least 100% the enzymatic activity of IDE.</p>It will be appreciated that IDE is a cellular enzyme which comprises an extracellular domain for substrate binding. Furthermore, IDE may also be secreted from the cells and thus, may bind its substrates extracellularly [Li et al. (2006) Cell 127:305-316; Shen et al. (2006) Nature 443:870-874]. Thus, it is envisioned by the present inventors that IDE will be inhibited by contacting on the cell surface or extracellularly.</p>It will be appreciated that the IDE inhibitor of the present invention is capable of reducing secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17, from T lymphocytes (as depicted in Example 1 hereinbelow).</p>As used herein, the term \u201cpro-inflammatory cytokines\u201d refers to cytokines which promote systemic inflammation. Exemplary pro-inflammatory cytokines include, but are not limited to, IFN-\u03b3, IL-17, INF-\u03b3, IL-17, TNF\u03b1, IL-6, IL-2 and IL-1\u03b3.</p>Methods of measuring levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines are well known in the art and include ELISA kit assays available e.g. from R&amp;D Systems.</p>Furthermore, IDE inhibitory activity of the peptide of the present invention re"
