    "ry weight of one or more of the catalysts described in U.S. Patent No. 8,466,242 and WO 2014/031956. The plate or heating block was placed uncovered in a vacuum oven heated to 50 to 150 \u00b0C under a vacuum of 10-800 mbar. The oven vacuum pump was protected by a two-stage condenser consisting of a recirculating chiller trap followed by a dry ice/acetone trap. The plates or blocks are heated for 30 minutes to 6 hours under elevated temperature and reduced pressure without stirring. After a pre-established period of time, the oven was vented to atmospheric pressure, the plates or blocks were cooled to room temperature, and each well or vial was diluted to approximately 50 Brix with deionized water. The solid-phase extraction steps described in Example 2 were performed by elution through sequential wet-packed columns in which the eluent from each column flows immediately into the top of the next column at a rate between 2 and 6 bed volumes/hour using a peristaltic pump or other suitable small pump. The column stack was then rinsed with deionized \n\n water and the combined effluents are concentrated by lyophilization to isolate solid powders with residual water content of 1-10% by mass. </p>Example 4. Modification of glycan therapeutics by removal of low molecular weight species</p>Oligomers or polymers prepared and purified as in Examples 1 and 2 were modified so as to remove low molecular weight species. The separation was achieved by osmotic separation. Approximately 45 cm of 1.0 kD MWCO Biotech CE dialysis tubing (31 mm flat width) from Spectrum Labs was placed into deionized water and soaked for 10 minutes, then one end was sealed with a dialysis tubing clip. A 25 Brix solution of 8 grams dry oligosaccharide was sterile filtered and sealed into the tube with a second clip along with a few mL of air to permit the tube to float. The filled tube was then placed in a 3 gallon tank of deionized water which was stirred with sufficient force to induce slow swirling of the sealed tubes. After 8 hours, the water in the tank was replaced and the tube was allowed to stir for an additional 16 hours. Once the dialysis was complete and the material had a DP2+ yield greater than 95% and a DP3+ yield greater than 90%, the dilute solution was sterile filtered and concentrated in vacuo to a final concentration of approximately 65 Brix or lyophilized to a solid with a residual moisture between 1 and 10%. Alternatively, the separation was achieved by tangential flow filtration (TFF). In this case, 100 mL of 25 Brix glycan sample dissolved in deionized water and sterile filtered was placed into the feed bottle of a Spectrum Labs KrosFlo Research Hi TFF system that was prepared according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The sample was then diafiltered through a 1 kD mPES MidiKros hollow-fiber filter at a transmembrane pressure of 25 psig. HPLC samples of the feed stock taken every 0.5 diafiltration volumes were used to determine when the material had a DP2+ yield greater than 95% and a DP3+ yield greater than 90% at which point the solution was sterile filtered and concentrated in vacuo to a 65 Brix syrup or lyophilized to a solid with residual water content of 1-10% by mass. </p>Example 5. Methods for analyzing preparations of glycan therapeutics </p> Measurement of glycan content by liquid refractometry </p>This experiment was designed to quantitate the amount of glycan in any given aqueous solution. A Mettler- Toledo Refracto 30GS portable sugar refractometer was calibrated using high-purity reverse-osmosis deionized water. Several drops of the glycan solution were filtered through a \n\n 0.2 micron syringe filter directly onto the lens of the refractometer. The measurement was taken at room temperature and reported as Brix. The glycans were routinely concentrated to 75 Brix without obvious solidification or crystallization at 23 \u00b0C. Brix can then be converted to solubility assuming a specific density of water equal to 1.0 g/mL. Thus, 75 Brix (100 grams of solution consisting of 75 grams of glycan and 25 grams of water) equals an aqueous solubility of 3.0 g/mL. As a comparison, the aqueous solubility of D-glucose is reported to be 0.909 g/mL (48 Brix) at 25 \u00b0C by Sigma- Aldrich. </p>Monomeric composition by hydrolysis and GC-MS </p>T",
    "d to the sample as an internal standard, then the sample was heated to 80 \u00b0C in 1M HCl/methanol for 18 hours. The resulting monosaccharides were then re-acetylated using pyridine and acetic anhydride in MeOH, and per-O-trimethylsilylated with Tri-Sil (Pierce) at 80 \u00b0C for 30 minutes. GC/MS analysis of the TMS methyl glycosides was performed on an Agilent 7890A GC interfaced to a 5975C MSD, using a Supelco Equity- 1 fused silica capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm ID). Each peak was assigned to a component sugar based upon comparison to known standards and integration of the respective peaks allowed clean calculation of the relative percentage of monomers within an exemplified glycan. In all tested cases, the monomer composition of a given oligosaccharide matched the input ratio within experimental error and the output composition matched the input composition within the precision of the measurement. </p>Molecular weight distribution by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) </p>This experiment was designed to quantitate the distribution of molecular weights within a given oligosaccharide. The measurement was made by HPLC using the method described in </p>Monograph of United States Pharmacopeia, 38(6) In-Process Revision: Heparin Sodium </p>(USP37-NF32). Separations were achieved on an Agilent 1200 HPLC system via a GE \n\n superpose 12 column using 50 mM ammonium acetate as an eluent at 1.0 mL/min flow rate and an ELSD detector. The column temperature was set at 30 \u00b0C and dextran (1 kD, 5 kD, 10 kD weight) were used to draw a standard curve. A 2 mg/ml solution of the samples was prepared and passed through a 0.45 \u03bc\u03b9\u03b7 spin filter, followed by 40 \u03bc\u0390 injections into the HPLC. A third- order polynomial curve was constructed based on the logarithmic molecular weights and elution volumes of the listed standards. The weight-average molecular weight (Mw), the number average molecular weight (Mn), and the polydispersity index (PDI) for the sample were calculated by comparison to the standard curve. Figure 1 shows the curve generated during the SEC evaluation of a glulOO sample in which the average molecular weight was determined to be 1212 g/mol or approximately DP7. The upper end of molecular weight of the material as defined by the point of the curve at 10% of maximum absorption leading the curve was determined to be 4559 g/mol or approximately DP28. The lower end of molecular weight of the material as defined by 10% of the maximum absorption trailing the curve was determined to be 200 g/mol or approximately DPI . Similar analysis of a glu50gal50 sample showed a MW, high mass, and low mass of 1195 g/mol (~DP7), 4331 g/mol ( DP27), and 221 g/mol (-DPI) respectively. </p>Molecular weight distribution by ion-affinity chromatography (IAC) </p>The proportion of glycan with DP greater than or equal to 2 (DP2+) and 3 (DP3+) may be measured by ion-affinity chromatography. A sample of glycan was diluted out to 50- 100 mg/mL and 10 \u03bc\u0390<sub>^</sub> of this solution was injected onto an"
