Antibodies from positively reacting clones can be further screened for reactivity in an ELISA-based assay to the mesothelin A form of mesothelin using microtiter plates coated with the mesothelin A. Clones that produce antibodies that are reactive to the mesothelin A form of mesothelin are eliminated, and clones that produce antibodies that are reactive to the mesovt2 isoform only are selected for further expansion and development. [0054] Confirmation of reactivity of the antibodies to the mesovt2 isoform of mesothelin may be accomplished, for example, using a Western Blot assay in which protein from lung, ovarian, or pancreatic cancer cells and purified mesovt2 and mesothelin A are run on an SDS-PAGE gel under reducing and non-reducing conditions, and subsequently are blotted onto a \n\nmembrane. The membrane may then be probed witn me putative anti-mesovtz antibodies. Reactivity with the mesovt2 form of mesothelin under non-reducing conditions and not the mesothelin A form of mesothelin (under reducing or non-reducing conditions) confirms specificity of reactivity for the mesovt2 isoform.

For in vivo antibody production, animals are generally immunized with an immunogenic portion of mesovt2 (preferably the region specific for mesovt2). [0057] In one embodiment, the immunogen used for immunizing animals or immunizing cells in vitro is a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of VNKGHEMSPQVATLIDRFVKGRGQLDK (SEQ ID NO:7) or immunogenic portions thereof. The immunogenic portion comprises at least 10-27 contiguous amino acids of SEQ ID NO:7. In some embodiments, the immunogenic portion comprises at least 10 contiguous amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 7, in other embodiments, the immunogenic portion comprises at least 15 contiguous amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 7, in other embodiments, the immunogenic portion comprises at least 17 contiguous amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 7, in other embodiments, the immunogenic portion comprises at least 20 contiguous amino acids of SEQ ID NO:7, in other embodiments, the immuno genie portion comprises at least 24 contiguous amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 7, in other embodiments, the immunogenic portion consists of the entire 27 contiguous amino acids of SEQ TD NO:7. [0058] In a specific embodiment, a peptide, designated pMESO2, having the amino acid sequence of NKG"
