    "late vector comprising SEQ ID NO: 210); \n\n pA-RSl_30 (comprising SEQ ID NO: 247; generated from a DNA template vector comprising SEQ ID NO: 211); pA-RSl_32 (comprising SEQ ID NO: 248; generated from a DNA template vector comprising SEQ ID NO: 212); pA-RSl_36 (comprising SEQ ID NO: 249; generated from a DNA template vector comprising SEQ ID NO: 213); pA-RSl_38 (comprising SEQ ID NO: 250; generated from a DNA template vector comprising SEQ ID NO: 214); pA-RSl_46 (comprising SEQ ID NO: 251; generated from a DNA template vector comprising SEQ ID NO: 215); pA-RSl_48 (comprising SEQ ID NO: 252; generated from a DNA template vector comprising SEQ ID NO: 216); and pA-RSl_58 (comprising SEQ ID NO: 224; generated from a DNA template vector comprising SEQ ID NO: 223). </p>[00289] The RSI protein expression levels of three AAV vector genomes (pA-RSl_8, pA-RSl_18, and pA-RSl_28) were evaluated using Western analysis (FIG. 13). Both pA- RS1 18 and pA-RSl_28 yielded higher fraction of secreted RSI protein compared to pA- RS1 8, although the total protein yields were comparable among these constructs. </p>[00290] Potency of AAV204 viral vector comprising indicated RSI -expressing vector genome was also evaluated in Lec2 cell culture. As shown in FIGs. 14A-14C, myc-tagged RSI was expressed at levels similar to untagged RSI in transduced Lec2 cells and was appropriately secreted. And the CBh promoter enabled higher expression of RSI compared to the RK promoter. The secreted myc-RSl is about 4 kD larger than native RSI (FIG. 14D). </p>EXAMPLE 5: In vivo Study of X-Linked Retinoschisis Treatment using AA V Viral Vectors encoding RSI </p>[00291] In one study, wildtype mice were administered with AAV204 viral vector comprising the RSI expression cassette via intravitreal injection. The expression of RSI protein in each animal group was evaluated by RT-qPCR (mRNA copy number/ng of total RNA.) and Western analysis, and the protein distribution by H4C (FIG. 15A), at 1-month time point post injection. \n\n[00292] As shown in FIG. 15B, expression of mouse RSI (mRSl) protein was detected in each tested mouse, and the mRSl expression mean values were not statistically different among the test groups. Mice administered with AAV204.pA-RSl_26 exhibits robust expression of myc-tagged human RSI (hRSl) at a level comparable to natural mRSl expression. On the other hand, there was little detectable expression of hRSl from the RK promoter at this time point in mice (with one exception). </p>[00293] In the next study, the eye cups of wildtype mice were administered with AAV204 viral vector comprising either pA-RSl_36 or pA-RSl_38 vector genome at a dosage of 3e+9 vg/eye via intravitreal injection. At 30-day post-injection, samples were collected, and total protein extract were examined by Western analysis using anti-myc antibody (FIG. 16A). Myc-hRSl protein expression was detected in all eyes administered with AAV204.pA-RSl_36 (comprising CBh promoter). In contrast, no myc-RSl protein "
