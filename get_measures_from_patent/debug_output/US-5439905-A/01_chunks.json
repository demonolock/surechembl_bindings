    "system and the peripheral nervous system, as well as prophylactic and therapeutic medicines for pancreatic disorders and gastrointestinal ulcers. Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention are expected to exhibit anti-dementia actions based on their antagonistic actions on cholecystokinin, and are useful as an anti-dementia.</p>Below, shown are the pharmacological actions of the compounds of the present invention.</p>The compounds of the present invention used for the test were as follows:</p>Compound A: 4-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-ethyl-8-methyl-6-(3-(3-methylphenyl)ureido)-8H-6,7-dihydro-thieno[3,2-f]-[1,4]diazepin-7-one</p>Compound B: 4-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-ethyl-9-methyl-6-(3-(3-methylphenyl)ureido)-6H-thieno[3,2-f][1,2,4]-triazolo[4,3-a][1,4]diazepine</p>As the control compounds, used were CCK-8, CCK-4 and the following compound.</p>L-364718: N-(2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-1H-1,4- benzodiazepin-3-yl)-1H-indole-2-carboxamide</p>EXPERIMENT EXAMPLE 1CCK Receptor-bindingThe entire pancreas of a male mongrel adult dog was extracted and the fat tissues thereof were removed. The residual portion was homogenized in 50 mM Tris hydrochloride (pH 7.5) (Blinkman\u2022Polytron PT20). After the filtration with nylon cloth (120 mesh) and subsequent centrifugation (50,000\u00d7g, 12 minutes), the obtained sediment was homogenized in a Tris buffer solution in the same manner as mentioned above and the homogenate was centrifuged. The obtained sediment was suspended in a buffer solution for binding assay (5 mM magnesium chloride, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mg/ml bacitracin, and 50 mM Tris hydrochloride, pH 7.2) containing 0.14 mg/ml trypsin-inhibitor (soy bean), and the suspension was used as a receptor source.</p>The binding assay was conducted by adding 50 \u03bcl of buffer solution (for the entire binding), unlabeled CCK-8 sulfate (for non-specific binding) or test compound (for the measurement of binding-inhibitory capability of <sup>125</sup> I-CCK) having the final concentration of 1 \u03bcM and 50 \u03bcl of <sup>125</sup> I-CCK-8 (63-67 TBq/mmol, 40,000-50,000 cpm) to 450 \u03bcl of membrane suspension (containing 100 \u03bcl of protein), incubating the reaction mixture at 20\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes, suction-filtering the mixture with glass fiber filter paper (Whatmann G/FB), washing three times with 2.5 ml per each tube of an ice-cooled Tris buffer solution immediately after the suction-filtration, and measuring the radio activity concentration on the filter paper.</p>The effect of the test compound on binding to CCK receptor was estimated by the concentration at which the specific binding was suppressed by 50% (IC<sub>50</sub>, nM) based on the inhibitory rate calculated by the following formula. ##EQU1##</p>The results are shown in Table 1.</p>              TABLE 1                                                     \n______________________________________                                    \n               CCK binding,                                               \n                          IC.sub.50 (nM)                                  \nTest compound  pancreas   brain                                           \n______________________________________                                    \nA              11      "
