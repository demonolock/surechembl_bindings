    "d in an immobilised metal ion affinity-based fluorescence polarisation (IMAP\u2122 FP) assay, which measures the degree of phosphorylation of a fluorescently labelled peptide substrate. IMAP\u2122 technology is based on high affinity binding of phosphate at high salt concentrations by immobilized metal (M<sup>III</sup>). The IMAP\u2122 \u201cbinding reagent\u201d complexes with phosphate groups on the phosphopeptide generated by the kinase reaction. Binding causes a change in the rate of the molecular motion of the peptide, resulting in an increase in fluorescence polarization (FP) observed. Hence, inhibition of activity is seen as a decrease in FP signal due to a lack of phospho-peptide.</p>Another example of an activity assay is an AlphaLISA\u00ae assay (Eglen R M et al. (2008) Curr Chem Genomics 1 p2). In this assay ASK1 activity is determined by measuring the degree of phosphorylation of a protein substrate (for example MKK4 or MKK7). AlphaLISA\u00ae technology is based on the binding of a substrate to two types of beads: acceptor and donor. Binding to one bead is through the tag of the substrate protein. Binding of the second bead is through phosphospecific binding of an antibody to the phosphosite of the substrate. This forms a sandwich, with the acceptor and donor beads in close proximity. When the donor beads are excited by light in the 680 nm range, a singlet oxygen is released and causes emission of light from the acceptor in the 620 nm range which can be detected in a suitable reader.</p>A suitable binding assay for determining ASK1 activity is a fluorescence polarisation (FP) ligand binding assay. As an example, this assay may involve the use of a Rhodamine Green labelled promiscuous kinase inhibitor that can be used as a competitor.</p>The present invention also provides ASK1 inhibitors, or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, for use in the treatment or prophylaxis of pain, for example chronic articular pain (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, gouty arthritis and juvenile arthritis) including the property of disease modification and joint structure preservation; musculoskeletal pain; lower back and neck pain; sprains and strains; neuropathic pain; sympathetically maintained pain; myositis; pain associated with cancer and fibromyalgia; pain associated with migraine; pain associated with influenza or other viral infections, such as the common cold; rheumatic fever; pain associated with functional bowel disorders such as non-ulcer dyspepsia, non-cardiac chest pain and irritable bowel syndrome; pain associated with myocardial ischemia; post operative pain; headache; toothache; and dysmenorrhea.</p>In particular ASK1 inhibitors or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be particularly useful in the treatment or prophylaxis of neuropathic pain and symptoms associated therewith. Neuropathic pain syndromes include: diabetic neuropathy; sciatica; non-specific lower back pain; multiple sclerosis pain; fibromyalgia; HIV-related neuropathy; post-herpetic neuralgia; trigeminal neuralgia; and pain resulting from physical trau",

Hypersensitivity to mechanical stimulus following acute inflammation was tested using the established model of intraplantar Freund's Complete Adjuvant (FCA)-induced inflammation Animals were tested for changes in mechanical hypersensitivity using an analgesymeter (mean paw withdrawal latency) at 1, 5, 9 and 14 days following FCA injection or weight bearing 24 hours after FCA injection. Results were expressed as mean ipsilateral/contralateral ratio for each test day and analysed using 2-way analysis of variance in Statistica with genotype and days post FCA being used as independent variables. Follow up analysis was carried out using Duncan's test. The results are shown in FIG. 1.</p>Following intraplantar FCA injection, analysis of the ipsilateral/contralateral weight bearing ratio or paw withdrawal thresholds revealed a significant effect of genotype between ASK1<sup>ki/ki </sup>and WT mice. ASK1<sup>ki/ki </sup>mice, homozygous for a loss of function ASK1 allele, failed to develop significant hypersensitivity at any time after FCA injection, whereas the WT mice displayed a significant reduction in ipsilateral/contralateral ratios. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that ASK1 may play a role in pain sensitivity.</p>EXAMPLE 55A Small Molecule Inhibitor of ASK1 Reverses Inflammatory Mechanical HypersensitivityIn order to replicate the phenotype observed with the ASK1 knock-in mice from example 54, but using a pharmacological tool, a small molecule inhibitor of ASK1 was used. The anti-hyperalgesic properties of N-[1-(5-methyl-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)-4-piperidinyl]benzamide (the compound of example 17) was trialled using the established model of intraplantar Freund's Complete Adjuvant (FCA)-induced inflammation. 24 hours after injection of FCA the compound was dosed orally and the effect on mechanical hypersensitivity assessed using weightbearing. The results are shown in FIG. 2. N-[1-(5-methyl-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)-4-piperidinyl]benzamide was found to partially reverse the inflammatory mechanical hypersensitivity caused by FCA at 30 mg/kg. This data is consistent with the hypothesis that ASK1 may play a role in inflammatory mechanical hypersensitivity.</p>EXAMPLE 56A Small Molecule ASK1 Inhibitor Significantly Decreases Chronic Constriction Injury Induced Mechanical AllodyniaIn order to establish if an ASK1 inhibitor is able to reverse hypersensitivity caused by neuronal injury in addition to inflammatory hypersensitivity, N-[1-(5-methyl-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)-4-piperidinyl]benzamide was trialled in the rat chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain. The results are shown in FIG. 3. N-[1-(5-methyl-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)-4-piperidinyl]benzamide partially reversed the mechanical allodynia caused by the nerve injury in the CCI model. This data suggests that ASK1 inhibitors may have therapeutic potential in neuropathic, in addition to inflammatory, pain states.</p>BRIEF EXPLANATION OF THE FIGURESFIGS. 1a and 1b show delayed mechanical hypersensitivity of ASK1<sup>ki/ki </sup>mice following FCA induced inflammation Animals were tested for changes in mechanical hypersensitivity after FCA injection (30 \u03bcL, 1 mg/mL) using either: (FIG. 1a) weight bearing at 24 h in female mice, (n=12 per group) or (FIG. 1b) paw withdrawal latency average at 1, 5, 9 and 14 days following FCA injection in male mice (n=12 ASK1<sup>ki/ki </sup>mice and n=12 wild-type littermates). (FIG. 1a WT vs Baseline ***P&lt;0.001; FIG. 1b ***P&lt;0.001 at day 1, 5, 9 and 14 for WT versus Baseline).</p>FIG. 2 A small molecule inhibitor of ASK1, N-[1-(5-methyl-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)-4-piperidinyl]benzamide, reverses inflammatory mechanical hypersensitivity. 24 hours after intraplantar injection of FCA (100 \u03bcL), rats (n=7 per group) were dosed with 1% methylcellulose vehicle, N-[1-(5-methyl-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)-4-piperidinyl]benzamide (3 mg/kg po, 30 mg/kg po) or celebrex (10 mg/kg po) and 1 hour later mechanical hypersensitivity was measured by weightbearing. (*P=0.013, **P=0.0004; statistical significance was determined using ANOVA followed by Fisher's LSD posthoc test comparing vehicle to response).</p>FIG. 3. N-[1-(5-methyl-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)-4-piperidinyl]benzamide partially reverses mechanical allodynia in the CCI model of nerve injury. Chronic constriction injury was performed on rats. Baseline readings of mechanical thresholds were taken on days \u22121 and 19 post surgery. Randomized groups of rats with allodynia (n=9-10) were dosed from day 20 to day 27 with either vehicle, N-[1-(5-methyl-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)-4-piperidinyl]benzamide (3 mg/kg po, 30 mg/kg po bid) or pregabalin (30 mg/kg pop bid). Mechanical allodynia was measured using Von Frey hairs 1 hour post morning dose on days 22, 25 and 27. The hypersensitivity observed was expressed as the area under the curve i"
