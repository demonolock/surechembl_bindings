    "The primary antibody used for the western analysis were a monoclonal antibody against Her2 (c-neu-Ab-3; Oncogene Science) and a monoclonal antibody against &lt;-tubulin (T5168; Sigma). The blotted membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulin and visualized with ECL chemiluminescence detection reagents (Amersham Bioscience). </p>Example 10 [0134] Fluorescence Perturbation Study </p>[0135] To monitor the ESX-DRIP130 interaction, we labeled ESX<sub>129</sub>-145with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC; Pierce) at the Lys<sub>144 </sub>position and measured its fluorescence spectra upon adding the glutatathione-S\u2032-transferase (GST) fusion of DRIP130<sub>352-625</sub>. ESX<sub>129-145 </sub>was synthesized by standard Fmoc chemistry (the NH<sub>2 </sub>terminus was capped by an acetyl group during the synthesis) and purified by HPLC. The peptide was then coupled with FITC at the Lys144 position in a conjugation buffer (100 mM carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9) in dark and purified by NAP-5 desalting column (Amersham). The labeled peptide was quantified by UV and visible absorbance. </p>[0136] GST-Sur-2<sub>352-625 </sub>was expressed and purified. Varied concentrations of the fusion protein were added to FITC-ESX<sub>129-145 (</sub>10 nM) in phosphate buffered saline containing 2% (v/v) ethanol, and the fluorescence spectra of FITC-ESX<sub>129-145 </sub>were measured by an ABI LS-50B Fluorescence Spectrometer (Ex: 490 nm). The dissociation constant of the interaction was estimated to be 12 \u03bcM through the emission perturbation at 522 nm. </p>[0137] To examine the effects of adamanolol on the interaction in vitro, the ethanol component of the binding buffer was replaced with an ethanolic solution of adamanolol. The fractions of FITC-ESX<sub>129-145 </sub>(10 nM) bound to 50 \u03bcM of GST-Sur-2<sub>352-625 </sub>were estimated by measuring fluorescence emission at 522 nm. ESX<sub>129-145 </sub>and pindolol were used as positive and negative controls, respectively (FIG. 3A). </p>Example 11 [0138] NMR Studies of Adamanolol. </p>[0139] Adamanolol (0.5 mg) was dissolved in 99.8% chloroform-d containing 0.05% (v/v) TMS, and NMR data of the sample were collected by a Bruker AMX600 spectrometer. The assignment of the proton signals was obtained by using a combination of TOCSY, DQF-COSY, and NOESY data sets. In the NOESY spectra, 512 free induction decays were recorded at 298 K with mixing times of 300 and 500 ms. The data were analyzed by the Felix98.0 software (Biosym Technologies) with appropriate apodization and zero-filling to yield real 2D 2K X 2K matrices after reduction. NMR analyses of adamanolol showed signal broadening of the protons around the urea linker at a room temperature and the absence of NOEs between the isopropyl protons and the piperidine even with a 500 msec NOESY mixing time.<sub>7 </sub>A reasonable explanation for these NMR characters is a rigid conformation around the urea linker with t"
