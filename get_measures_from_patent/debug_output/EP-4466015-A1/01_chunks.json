Such a DNA sequence may be regarded as being similar to a proviral vector according to the invention, comprising an additional promoter to allow the transcription of the vector sequence and improve the particle production rate. </p>In a preferred embodiment, the host cell is further modified to be able to produce viral particle in a culture medium in a continuous manner, without the entire cells swelling or dying. One may refer to Strang et al., 2005, J Virol 79(3):1165-71 ; Relander et al., 2005, Mol Ther 1 1 (3):452-9; Stewart et al., 2009, Gene Ther, 16(6) :805-14; and Stuart et al., 2011 , Hum gene Ther, with respect to such techniques for producing viral particles. \n\n The lentiviral particle vectors can comprise the following elements, as previously defined: </p>- cPPT/CTS polynucleotide sequence; and </p>- a nucleic acid encoding a CAR under control of a p2m or Major Histocompatibility Complex classe I (MHC-I) promoter, and optionally one of the additional elements described above. </p>Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the examples which follow and will also be illustrated in the figures. </p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES </p>Figure 1 : Down-selection of a Scov-2 variant with the highest potential to induce cross sero-neutralizing antibodies.

Statistical significance was evaluated by Mann-Whitney test (*= p &lt; 0.05, **= p &lt; 0.01 ). </p>The LV-based strategy, which is highly productive, not only in inducing humoral responses but also and particularly in establishing high quality and memory T-cell responses (Ku MW, etal. Commun Biol, 4(1), 713, 2021), is a favorable platform for a heterologous boost, even if it is also largely efficacious by its own as a primary COVID-19 vaccine candidate (Ku MW, et al. Cell Host Microbe, 29(2), 236-249 e236, 2021; Ku MW, et al. EMBO Mol Med, e14459, 2021). Furthermore, and importantly, LV is non-cytopathic, non-replicative and scarcely inflammatory and thus can be used to perform non-invasive i.n. boost, to efficaciously induce sterilizing mucosal immunity which protects the respiratory system, as well as the CNS (Ku MW, et al. Cell Host Micr",
    "ical isolate (Planas eta!., Nature, 2022, 602, 671-675). Animals were housed in an isolator in BioSafety Level 3 animal facilities of Institut Pasteur. The organs recovered from the infected animals were manipulated according to the approved standard procedures of these facilities. </p>Pseudovirus neutralization assay </p>Nab quantification was assessed via an inhibition assay which uses HEK293T cells stably expressing human ACE2 (HEK 293T-ACE2) and non-replicative Scov-2 pseudo-typed LV particles which harbor the reporter luciferase firefly gene, allowing quantitation of the host cell invasion by mimicking fusion step of native SARS-CoV-2 virus, as previously described (Sterlin et al., Sci. Transl. Med., 2021, 13, eabd2223). Serum samples or clarified lung homogenates were heat inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes. Serial four-fold dilutions of samples diluted in 25 pl DMEM-glutamax (Gibco, 21063-029) containing 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco, 1 1360-070) were mixed with 1 ng of Scov-2 pseudo-typed LV p24 equivalent in 25 pl for 30 min at room temperature, in U-bottom plates. Samples were then transferred into clear-flat-bottom 96-well-black-plates (Corning, CLS3603) containing 2 10<sup>4</sup> HEK 293T-ACE2 cells. The plates were incubated for 72 hours at 37\u00b0C and then assayed for luciferase expression using the ONE-Glo\u2122 Luciferase Assay System (Promega, E6120) on an EnSpire plate reader (PerkinElmer). EC50 was reported as the reciprocal of the serum dilution conferring 50% of infection of HEK 293T-ACE2 cells by lentiviral vectors bearing the indicated Scov-2 variants. </p>Determination of viral loads in the organs </p>Lungs and nasal turbinates (NT) were removed aseptically and immediately frozen at - 80\u00b0C. RNA from circulating SARS-CoV-2 was prepared from lungs as recently described (Ku MW, et al. Cell Host Microbe, 29(2), 236-249 e236, 2021). Briefly, lung homogenates were prepared by thawing and homogenizing of the organs using lysing matrix A (MP Biomedicals, 116913050-CF) in 500 pl of ice-cold PBS in an MP Biomedical Fastprep 24 Tissue Homogenizer and were used to determine viral loads by E-specific qRT-PCR. Alternatively, total RNA was prepared from lungs or NT by addition of lysing matrix D (MP Biomedical, 1 16910050-CF) containing 1 mL of TRIzol reagent (ThermoFisher, 15596026) and homogenization at 30 s at 6.0 m/s twice using MP Biomedical Fastprep 24 Tissue Homogenizer. These RNA preparations were used to determine viral loads by Esg-specific qRT-PCR or inflammatory mediators. \n\nSARS-CoV-2 E gene or E sub-genomic mRNA (Esg RNA), was quantitated following reverse transcription and real-time quantitative TaqMan\u00ae PCR, using SuperScript\u2122 III Platinum\u2122 One-Step qRT-PCR Kit (Invitrogen, 11732020) and specific primers and probe (Eurofins) as previously described (Corman et al. Euro Surveill. 2020, 25(3); Wolfel et al., Nature 2020, 581 (7809) :465-9). The standard curve"
