    "quantity being such that one or more predetermined units of the dosage form are normally required for a single therapeutic administration. In the case of multiple dose forms, such as a scored tablet, said predetermined unit will be one fraction such as a half or quarter of the multiple dose form. It will be understood that the specific dose level for any patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the indication being treated, active agent employed, the activity of active agent, severity of the indication, patient health, age, sex, weight, diet, and pharmacological response, the specific dosage form employed and other such factors.</p>Following preparation of the SAE-CD composition, it can be used to prepare a formulation wherein the SAE-CD composition is complexed with or not complexed with an active agent. By \u201ccomplexed\u201d is meant \u201cbeing part of a clathrate or inclusion complex with\u201d, i.e., a complexed active agent is part of a clathrate or inclusion complex with a cyclodextrin derivative.</p>By active agent/CD complex is generally meant a clathrate or inclusion complex of a cyclodextrin derivative and an active agent. The ratio of active agent: CD present in the molecular complex can vary and can be in the range of about 10 to about 0.1, on a molar basis. Thus, the CD will generally be, but need not be, present in excess of the active agent. The amount of excess will be determined by the intrinsic solubility of the agent, the expected dose of the agent, and the binding constant for inclusion complexation between the specific drug (agent) and the specific CD derivative used. It should be noted that the cyclodextrin derivative can be present in uncomplexed form and therefore in amounts substantially in excess of the amount of active agent present. The weight ratio or molar ratio of derivatized cyclodextrin to active agent can exceed 100, 1000 or even more.</p>Under some conditions, the SAE-CD composition can form one or more ionic bonds with a positively charged acid-ionizable compound. Therefore, it is possible for a compound to be complexed by way of an inclusion complex with the derivatized cyclodextrin and to be non-covalently but ionically bound to the derivatized cyclodextrin.</p>Even though the SAE-CD composition can be the sole carrier or excipient in a formulation, it is possible to add other carriers to the formulation to further improve its performance.</p>The SAE-CD composition can be included in any formulation requiring a derivatized cyclodextrin. An active agent included in the formulation can be delivered according to a rapid, immediate, pulsatile, timed, targeted, delayed and/or extended release formulation.</p>By \u201cimmediate release\u201d is meant a release of an active agent to an environment over a period of seconds to no more than about 30 minutes once release has begun and release begins within no more than about 2 minutes after administration. An immediate release does not exhibit a significant delay in the release of"
