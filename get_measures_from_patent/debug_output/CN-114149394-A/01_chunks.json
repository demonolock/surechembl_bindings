    "l of freshly prepared medium containing 0.5mg/ml MTT was added to each well, and incubation was continued for 4h at 37 \u2103. The supernatant was carefully discarded, 150. mu.l DMSO was added, and after mixing for 10min with a micro shaker, the Optical Density (OD) was measured at 492nm with a microplate reader.</p>2) The suspension cells are selected from cells in logarithmic growth phase, and prepared into 1 \u00d7 10 medium by RPMI l640 containing 10% calf serum<sup>4</sup>The cell suspension/ml was inoculated in 96-well plates at 50. mu.l/well, 37 \u2103 and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>And culturing for 24 h.
