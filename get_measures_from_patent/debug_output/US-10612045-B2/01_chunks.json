    "d routinely using BLAST programs (basic local alignment search tools) and PowerBLAST programs known in the art (Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol., 1990, 215, 403-410; Zhang and Madden, Genome Res., 1997, 7, 649-656) or by using the Gap program (Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package, Version 8 for Unix, Genetics Computer Group, University Research Park, Madison Wis.), using default settings, which uses the algorithm of Smith and Waterman (Adv. Appl. Math., 1981, 2, 482-489).</p>The terms \u201cpeptide,\u201d \u201cpolypeptide,\u201d and \u201cprotein\u201d are used interchangeably herein, and refer to a polymeric form of amino acids of any length, which can include coded and non-coded amino acids, chemically or biochemically modified or derivatized amino acids, and polypeptides having modified peptide backbones.</p>\u201cBinding\u201d as used herein (e.g. with reference to an RNA-binding domain of a polypeptide) refers to a non-covalent interaction between macromolecules (e.g., between a protein and a nucleic acid). While in a state of non-covalent interaction, the macromolecules are said to be \u201cassociated\u201d or \u201cinteracting\u201d or \u201cbinding\u201d (e.g., when a molecule X is said to interact with a molecule Y, it is meant the molecule X binds to molecule Y in a non-covalent manner). Not all components of a binding interaction need be sequence-specific (e.g., contacts with phosphate residues in a DNA backbone), but some portions of a binding interaction may be sequence-specific. Binding interactions are generally characterized by a dissociation constant (Kd) of less than 10<sup>\u22126 </sup>M, less than 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, less than 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, less than 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>M, less than 10<sup>\u221210 </sup>M, less than 10<sup>\u221211 </sup>M, less than 10<sup>\u221212 </sup>M, less than 10<sup>\u221213 </sup>M, less than 10<sup>\u221214 </sup>M, or less than 10<sup>\u221215 </sup>M. \u201cAffinity\u201d refers to the strength of binding, increased binding affinity being correlated with a lower Kd.</p>By \u201cbinding domain\u201d it is meant a protein domain that is able to bind non-covalently to another molecule. A binding domain can bind to, for example, a DNA molecule (a DNA-binding protein), an RNA molecule (an RNA-binding protein) and/or a protein molecule (a protein-binding protein). In the case of a protein domain-binding protein, it can bind to itself (to form homodimers, homotrimers, etc.) and/or it can bind to one or more molecules of a different protein or proteins.</p>The term \u201cconservative amino acid substitution\u201d refers to the interchangeability in proteins of amino acid residues having similar side chains. For example, a group of amino acids having aliphatic side chains consists of glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine; a group of amino acids having aliphatic-hydroxyl side chains consists of serine and threonine; a group of amino acids having amide containing side chains consisting of asparagine and glutamine; a group of amino acids having aromatic side chains consists of phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; a group of amino acids having basic side chains consists of lysine, arginine, and histidine; a group of amino acids having acidic side chains consists of glutamate and aspartate; and a group of amino acids having sulfur containing side chains consists of cysteine and methionine. Exemplary conservative amino acid substitution groups are: valine-leucine-isoleucine, phenylalanine-tyrosine, lysine-arginine, alanine-valine, and asparagine-glutam"
