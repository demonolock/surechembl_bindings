    "ortant to the differentiation of identical stem/progenitor cells on the other hand not to be reached common understanding, and there is substantial amounts of arguement.Typical case\nWnt/ signals\uff08Referred to as classical Wnt signal or Wnt/ beta-catenin white signals\uff09With the one group of soluble cell indicated as it\nMatter beta-catenin, they with by core protein axle albumen, APC, GSK3\uff08Glycogen synthase kinase 3\uff09With CK1- \u03b1\uff08Casein kinase\n1-\u03b1\uff09The degraded compound of composition is related.In the case of in the absence of Wnt parts, phosphinylidyne occurs for beta-catenin in the compound\nChange, so that targetting it is used for ubiquitination and subsequently by the destruction of proteasome machine (6).The activation of Wnt paths triggers one\nRow event, these events interference beta-catenin targeting destruction needed for APC/ axles albumen/GSK3 compounds, and thus promote\nThe stabilization of beta-catenin and accumulation in cytoplasm.Accumulation in this cytoplasm passes through not yet completely fixed true with beta-catenin\nFixed mechanism indexing is consistent into core.In the classical definition of Wnt signal cascades, in core, beta-catenin and transcription because\nThe TCF/LEF family members of son form compound.For production transcriptional activity compound, beta-catenin raise transcription co-activation because\nSon, cAMP response element binding proteins (CREB)-associated proteins (CBP) or its homologue being closely related, p300\uff08E1A- is combined\nAlbumen, 300-KD\uff09And the other components of basal transcription mechanism, so as to cause the expression (7,8) of the host of downstream target gene.Shen\nThe research asked someone is it is also shown that CBP and catenin family member companionship are not limited to beta-catenin.In the absence of \u03b2-company\nIn the case of cyclase protein, CBP can also be with other catenin sample molecules\uff08Such as \u03b3-catenin\uff09Form companion (9).</p>CBP and p300.CBP and p300 are about 300kd large protein.They are considered as the work with redundancy for a long time\nWith, and treated in the literature as a kind of albumen and identical albumen.Nearest work has been described, CBP and p300 and number\nHundred kinds of protein interactions, it functions as the main coordinating factor (orchestrator) of transcription.Although they have\nThe homology of height, but the evidence of accumulation shows that CBP and p300 are not redundancies, but be respectively provided with vitro and in vivo clearly\nAnd unique effect (10-12).The directed mutagenesis studies have shown that mammalian development of mouse is to CBP and p300 gene dosages pole\nIt is sensitive.Have shown that the mouse heterozygote of CBP (CBP+/-) orthomutation shows skeletal abnormality, some of them are similar to relative\nRare genetic block Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) (13).The analysis shows of p300 Mutant Mices, p300's\nGene dosage is also significant (14) for developing.Noticeablely, CBP heterozygotes (CBP+/-) and p300 heterozygotes\n(p300+/-) m"
