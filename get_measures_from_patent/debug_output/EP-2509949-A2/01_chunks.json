While some o f the patents cited above are more related than others, none of the patents or publications describe the class of compounds according to the present invention disclosure. </p>The class of compounds described in this invention disclosure are chiral and achiral oxy- substituted cyclopentyl pyridinone diketocarboxamides and their derivatives. The compounds have been designed as inhibitors of H IV- 1 integrase and have been discovered to possess significant in vitro anti-HIV activity. Two examples are shown below (Figure la and b). The chiral compound ( S,S- isomer. Figure l a) exhibits anti-HIV activity in cell culture with an EC50 of 25 nM (TI &gt;1 ,500). The achiral compound ( Figure lb) is more active and has an EC<sub>50</sub> of 10 nM (TI &gt; 10,000). </p></p> Figure l a Figure lb \n\n SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>Chiral and achiral oxy-substituted cyclopentyl pyridinone d ik etocarbox am ides and their derivatives and methods for their preparations are disclosed. The compounds are represented by formula I and include chiral and achiral compounds, tautomers, regioisomers, geometric isomers, wherein the modified nucleobase scaffold and R, X and Z groups are as otherwise defined in the specification. These complex carboxamides are designed as inhibitors of HIV replication through inhibition of HIV integrase. The compounds are useful in the prevention, inhibition or treatment of infection by HIV and in the treatment of AIDS and ARC, either as the compounds, or as pharmaceutically acceptable salts, with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, used alone or in combination with antivirals, immunomodulators, antibiotics, vaccines, and other therapeutic agents, especially other anti-HIV compounds (including other anti-H IV integrase agents), which can be used to create combination anti-HIV cocktails. Methods of treating, preventing and/or reducing the likelihood of AIDS and ARC and methods of treating or preventing infection by HIV are also described, the method comprising administering one or more compounds according to the present invention, optionally in combination with additional agents, including "
