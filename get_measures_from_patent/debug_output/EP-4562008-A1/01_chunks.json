IRAK3-ePL Overexpressing Degradation Assay [00262] Stable cell lines were generated by the following protocol.3 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> Lenti-X 293T cells (Clonetech) were plated in 0.8 mL of media in a 12-well plate and incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C/5% CO2. Packaging plasmid (0.4 \u03bcg, pMD), envelope plasmid (0.4 \u03bcg, pSP), and lentiviral transfer IRAK3-ePL plasmid (0.8 \u03bcg, IRAK3 sequence NM_007199.3) were mixed in 0.1 mL of Opti-MEM and incubated for 5 min. Simultaneously, 2.4 \u03bcL of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was added to 0.1 mL of Opti-MEM (Gibco) and incubated for 5 min. The plasmid DNA and lipofectamine were combined and the mixture was allowed to incubate for 20 min.DNA:Lipofectamine Opti-MEM mixtures were then added to previously plated cells dropwise and the cells were incubated for ~16 h at 37 \u00b0C/5% CO2. Following incubation, the media was removed and 1.2 mL of fresh media was added per well. Lenti-X 293T cells were incubated for ~30 h at 37 \u00b0C/5% CO<sub>2</sub>.0.5 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup>293T<sup>CRBN OE/GSPT1 G575N KI</sup> cells were plated in 0.5 mL of media/well of a 12-well plate and incubated for ~16 h at 37\u00b0 C/5% CO2. Following incubation, media was removed from the Lenti-X 293T wells and passed through a 0.45 \u03bcM filter. Part of the viral supernatant was used to transduce cells and the rest was stored at -80 \u00b0C. Viruses were then added individually (0.5 mL virus) to each well of the 293T<sup>CRBN OE/GSPT1 G575N</sup> <sup>KI</sup> cells, followed by addition of polybrene (10 mg/mL Millipore) to each well at a final concentration of 5.0 \u03bcg/mL. Cells were incubated for ~24 h at 37 \u00b0C/5% CO<sub>2</sub>. After aspirating media off plates, cells were washed with DPBS, trypsinized and plated in a 10 cm dish in 15 mL of media and 1 \u03bcg/mL puromycin. Following incubation of cells for ~72 h at 37 \u00b0C/5% CO2, \n\nmedia was aspirated off plates, and cells were washed with DPBS and trypsinized. The cells were plated in a 15 cm dish in 40 mL of media with 1.0 \u03bcg/mL Puromycin (Gibco) and incubated for ~72 h at 37 \u00b0C/5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Following incubation, media was removed and cells were washed with DPBS and trypsinized. The majority of cells were resuspended in Invitrogen freezing media and stored away (~6-8 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> cells/vial). [00263] IRAK3-ePL cellular dose response curve degradation assays were performed by the following protocol. Compounds to be tested were dispensed into a white 384-well tissue-culture treated plate using an acoustic liquid handler. Dilutions were prepared based on a 25 \u03bcL assay volume in duplicate 10 point 3-fold serial dilutions starting with a 10 \u03bcM dose. Negative control wells were included, which only contain 0.2% DMSO to calculate 100% signal. Positive control wells containing 30 \u03bcM Ataluren (luciferase inhibitor) were included to calculate the background signal level. All wells were backfilled to a final DMSO concentration of 0.2% to ensure DMSO uniformity across wells. ",
    "dation. Then 2 \u00b5L of each solution was added to 16 \u00b5L lysate. Buffer control (lysis buffer detection buffer), Cryptate control (lysis buffer + cryptate antibody + detection buffer), and Negative control (lysis buffer + cryptate antibody + D2 antibody) were made as per manufacturers recommendation. Post incubation with antibodies the HTRF signal was measured using a Perkin Elmer Envision reader and the HTRF signal was calculated using formula: (Emission at 665 nm/ Emission at 615 nm)*10,000. All HTRF values were normalized to the average value of DMSO. The average value of the DMSO control wells were set to equal 100% of the relative IRAK3 protein levels. Normalized luminescence values were plotted on a graph as a function of compound concentration. Compound concentration was plotted on the x-axis and the corresponding normalized IRAK3 protein levels on the y-axis. The EC<sub>50</sub> value (the half-maximum effective concentration) of a compound for the degradation of the IRAK3 was calculated using a four- parameter logistic model (sigmoidal dose\u2212response model) (FIT = (A + {(B \u2212 A)/1 + [(C/x)D]})) where C is the inflection point (EC<sub>50</sub>), D is the correlation coefficient, and A and B are the low and high limits of the fit, respectively). The Ymin was calculated by determining the lowest percentage of target protein remaining following compound treatment. Dmax was calculated from Y<sub>min</sub> (%D<sub>max</sub> = 100-Y<sub>min</sub>). Example B3. IRAK3 Biochemical Binding Assay [00266] The LanthaScreen\u00ae Eu Kinase Binding assay was performed as described by the vendor (ThermoFisher Scientific Waltham, MA). Briefly, 100X solutions of compound were prepared in DMSO via serial dilution of the 10 mM stock solution in a 384-well reagent plate using 3-fold intervals to achieve final concentrations.1 \u03bcL of the compound dilution series were added to the corresponding wells of a 384-well reagent plate containing 32.3 \u03bcL of 1x buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 10 nM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA, 0.01% Brij-35).5 \u03bcL of the buffer diluted compounds were transferred to the corresponding wells of a 384-well assay plate.5 \u03bcL of 3X tracer was transferred to each well of the assay plate for a final tracer concentration of 10 nM. Finally, 5 \u03bcL of the 3X Eu-Anti-GST and IRAK3 mix was transferred to each well for a final concentration of 2 nM and 10 nM, respectively. Reactions were allowed to incubate for 1 hour at \n\nroom temperature. TR-FRET signal of the interaction (\u03bbex340/ \u03bbem 665/ \u03bbem 615) was read at room temperature with a delay time of 100 \u00b5s and an integration time of 200 \u00b5s using an Envision plate reader. Background corrected emission signal ratios at each compound concentration were used to calculate percentage of inhibition (% Inhibition). Plots of % Inhibition versus inhibitor concentrations were fit according to a dose-response equation (Eq.1) to generate IC<sub>50</sub> and Hill slope values using Dotmatics software (Dotmatics, Bishops Stortford, <sup>Hertfordshire, England).</sup> % Using these assays\n\n, IC50, Dmax, EC50, and DC50 values of the following compounds were determined. Dmax is defined as the maximum percent degradation achieved and DC50 is the concentration at which 50% degradation is achieved. Data is summarized in Table 2. Table 2.
