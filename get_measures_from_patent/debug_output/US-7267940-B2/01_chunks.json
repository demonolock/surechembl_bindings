    "the complex formed by two molecules comprising the same peptide via a covalent bond, such as a disulfide bond, or a noncovalent bond, such as via the binding interaction between a known tag and tag-binder pair (e.g., biotin and avidin). The covalent bond or noncovalent bond typically occurs between the linker portions of the two peptide-containing molecules.</p>The term \u201can internal amino acid residue\u201d as used herein refers to any amino acid residue that is not the first residue from either the N-terminus or the C-terminus of an HSV-2 peptide of the present invention.</p>The term \u201cbiological sample\u201d refers to sections of tissues such as biopsy and autopsy samples, and frozen sections taken for histological purposes. Such samples may include whole blood, serum, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, sputum, tissue, cultured cells, e.g., primary cultures, explants, transformed cells, stool, urine, vesicle fluid, mucus, and other bodily secretion, or tissue that could be sampled with a swab device. A biological sample is typically obtained from a human who may have been infected with HSV-2.</p>The term \u201cantibody\u201d denotes a protein of the immunoglobulin family or a polypeptide including fragments of an immunoglobulin that is capable of noncovalently, reversibly, and in a specific manner binding a corresponding antigen. An illustrative antibody structural unit includes a tetramer. Each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one \u201clight\u201d (about 25 kD) and one \u201cheavy\u201d chain (about 50-70 kD), connected through one or more disulfide bonds. The recognized immunoglobulin genes include the \u03ba, \u03bb, \u03b1, \u03b4, \u03b3, \u03b5, and \u03bc constant region genes, as well as the myriad immunoglobulin variable region genes. Light chains are classified as either \u03ba or \u03bb Heavy chains are classified as \u03b3, \u03bc, \u03b1, \u03b4, or \u03b5 which in turn define the immunoglobulin classes, IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE, respectively. The N-terminus of each chain defines a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The terms variable light chain (V<sub>L</sub>) and variable heavy chain (V<sub>H</sub>) refer to these regions of light and heavy chains respectively.</p>The term \u201ccomplementarity-determining domains\u201d or \u201cCDRs\u201d refers to the hypervariable regions of V<sub>l </sub>and V<sub>H</sub>. The CDR is the target protein-binding site of the antibody chain that harbors specificity for that target protein. There are three CDRs (CDR1-3numbered sequentially from the N-terminus) in each human V<sub>L </sub>or V<sub>H</sub>, constituting about 15-20% of the variable domains. The CDRs are structurally complementary to the epitope of the target protein and are thus directly responsible for the binding specificity. The remaining stretches of the V<sub>L </sub>or V<sub>H</sub>, the so-called framework regions, exhibit less variation in amino acid sequence (Kuby, Immunology, 4th ed., Chapter 4, W.H. Freeman &amp; Co., New York, 2000).</p>The positions of the CDRs and frame"
