    " has been amended to be less toxic or even non-toxic by amending the wild-type amino acid sequence. Such a mutation could be a substitution of one or more amino acids. A modified toxoid, as used herein, is a bacterial toxoid, on which a functional group X has been introduced by reacting said bacterial toxoid with a bifunctional linker. Thus, the modified toxoid presents a or is modified with functional group X, said functional group X being capable of reacting with the terminal thiol group of the compounds of general formula (I). The term \"bifunctional linker\" refers to a bifunctional molecule containing functional group X and functional group Y, wherein functional group X is capable of reacting with the terminal thiol group on the compounds of general formula (I) and the functional group Y is capable of reacting with a carrier. It is especially preferred that the compound of general formula (I) is covalently linked to the non-toxic mutated diphtheria toxin CRM<sub>197</sub>, which is modified with the functional group X. Preferably, the compound of general formula (I) is covalently linked to the non-toxic mutated diphtheria toxin CRM<sub>197</sub>, which is modified with maleimide. In the most preferred embodiment, the compound of general formula (I) is covalently linked to the non-toxic mutated diphtheria toxin CRM<sub>197</sub>, which is modified with \u03b1-iodoacetamide.</p>CRM<sub>197</sub> like wild-type diphtheria toxin is a single polypeptide chain of 535 amino acids (58 kD) consisting of two subunits linked by disulfide bridges having a single amino acid substitution of glutamic acid for glycine. It is used as a carrier protein in a number of approved conjugate vaccines, such as the pneumococcal vaccine Prevnar 13\u00ae (Pfizer Inc.).</p>In one aspect of the present invention the compounds of the formula (I) are covalently linked to a carrier for the use in a vaccine. The binding or covalent linkage to the carrier can be accomplished by first providing a suitable carrier capable of stimulating the immune system's response to a target antigen, but does not in itself confer immunity as defined above. Examples of suitable carriers include, but they are not restricted to peptidic compounds, bacterial peptides, compounds derived from a bacterial peptides, mutated toxoids and glycosphingolipids with immunomodulatory properties.</p>Preferably, such a suitable carrier is CRM<sub>197</sub>. Said suitable carriers are able to react with the functional group Y of the bifunctional linker to provide a carrier modified with a functional group X. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the carrier is modified by at least one functional group X of the group comprising or consisting of maleimide; \u03b1-iodoacetyl; \u03b1-bromoacetyl; N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (NHS), 2-pyridyldithiols, thiol and vinyl (see also Figure 4A). The introduction of such functional group X on the carrier is preferably accomplished by reaction of a suitable carrier with a bifunctional "
