    "with timestamps within one CI;</p>(ii) if there is only one void in a CI and the patient cannot recall the time of the void, then the entire 48 hour Collection Session is excluded from the analysis and an additional Collection Session is conducted;</p>(iii) if a void is discarded by the patient but the time of the void is known, the duration associated with that void (time of the void minus the time of the previous void) is subtracted from the total duration associated with that CI and the modified duration is used to calculate the rate of aMT6s production but if a discarded sample is either the first or last of the samples in a given CI, then the midpoint of that CI will be calculated without considering that sample; provided that, if fewer than 4 samples are available for any one Collection Session, acrophase will not be determined for that Collection Session.</p>21. in step (h), if \u03c4&gt;=24.1 hours or the 95% Confidence Interval does not cross 24.0 hours, then treatment is continued and the patient is retested after a second complete circadian cycle.</p>22. in step (g), if the patient's \u03c4 is longer than 24 hours, e.g., \u03c4&gt;=24.1 hours, the patient's acrophase is projected for each of the 90 days following Day 2 of the final Collection Session.</p>23. aMT6s or cortisol is extracted from pooled urine samples by solid phase extraction, the extracts are evaporated to dryness, the residue is then reconstituted with solvent, and the solution is analyzed by HPLC-MS, an antibody binding assay, or other analytical technique.</p>Thus, a particular illustrative embodiment of a method of determining tau and thereafter treating a patient thereby determined to have a free-running circadian rhythm is as follows:</p>a) collecting and, if more than one, physically pooling urine samples from the patient during each of 9 Collection Intervals (CIs) during four weekly 48 hour collection sessions, said 9 CIs being CI2, CI3, CI4, CI5, CI6, CI7, CI8, CI9, and CI10, as follows:</p>CI1: 4 hour period beginning approximately on initiation of wake time of Day 1 of the first Collection Session;</p>CI2: 4 hour period beginning at the end of CI1;</p>CI3: 4 hour period beginning at the end of CI2;</p>CI4: 4 hour period beginning at the end of CI3;</p>CI5: Overnight, i.e., sleep time (approx 8 hours),</p>CI6: 4 hour period beginning approximately on initiation of wake time of Day 2 of the collection session;</p>CI7: 4 hour period beginning at the end of CI6;</p>CI8: 4 hour period beginning at the end of CI7;</p>CI9: 4 hour period beginning at the end of CI8;</p>CI10: Overnight, i.e., sleep time (approx 8 hours),</p>b) (i) optionally collecting and discarding samples during CI1 and (ii) assigning the mid-point between the last void of each CI immediately preceding a given subsequent CI and the last void of the given subsequent CI as the Collection Time Point for each of CI2, CI3, CI4, CI5, CI6, CI7, CI8, CI9, and CI10;</p>c) measuring the amount of aMT6s or cortisol in each o"
