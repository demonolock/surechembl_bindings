    " to each well plate and each sample was assayed using parallel three-well analysis. After incubation for 2 hours at 37\u00b0 C., plate was rinsed for three times with PBST followed by adding 100 \u03bcl/well of a 1:2000 dilution of mouse anti-His-tag antibody (available from Santa cruz) for 1 hour at 37\u00b0 C. To test the bound antibody, HRP-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (purchased from Santa Cruz) was diluted in PBST at a 1:15,000 dilution and 100 \u03bcl per well was added and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 hour. For detection, wells were rinsed for three times with PBST followed by rinsing for three times with PBS and finally TMB was added for development for 15 mins. The chromogenic reaction was stopped with 50 \u03bcl of 2 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>per well and extinction value was measured at 450 nm using enzyme-linked immunoassay (Bio-Rad). The absorbance values obtained were evaluated using Sigma Plot software and the binding strength of an antibody was calculated. For this purpose, the extinction value measured in each case was plotted against the corresponding antibody concentration and the resulting curve was fitted using the following non-linear regression.</p>y=a*x(b+x)</p>Wherein the binding/dissociation equilibrium identified between the immobilized antigen and the antibody protein is:</p>x=concentration of antibody protein;</p>y=concentration of antigen/antibody complex (indirectly measured by absorbance after color reaction);</p>a=total concentration of immobilized antigen;</p>b=dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>).</p>The binding curve obtained for antibody 7B3 in concentration-gradient ELISA assay is exemplarily shown in FIG. 2 with K<sub>D </sub>of about 22.4 nM; the binding curve of antibody Y022 to EGFRvIII is shown in FIG. 3 with apparent K<sub>D </sub>of about 2.7 nM.</p>Example 6. Activity Analysis on Binding of Y022 to Cell Surface EGFR1. Expression and Purification of scFv-Y022-Fc, scFv-806-Fc and scFv-C225-Fc Fusion Antibody</p>According to a standard scheme, scFv-Y022 fragment was amplified from the resulting clones using the primer pair V5-Y022-F (SEQ ID NO: 14, ACAGTGCTAGCAGATATTCAGATGACCCAG) and V5-Y022-R (SEQ ID NO: 15, AAGAATGCGGCCGCGCTGCTCACGGTCACCAG); ScFv-806 was amplified using the primer pair V5-806-F (SEQ ID NO: 16, ACAGTGCTAGCAGACATCCTGATGACCCAAT) and V5-806-R (SEQ ID NO: 17, AAGAATGCGGCCGCTGCAGAGACAGTGACCAG) and pH-806/CD3 (see 201210094008.X) as the template; scFv-C225 fragment was cloned using the primer pairs V5-C225-F (SEQ ID NO: 18, ACAGTGCTAGCAGACATCTTGCTGACTCAG) and V5-C225-R (SEQ ID NO: 19, AAGAATGCGGCCGCTGCAGAGACAGTGACCAG) and C225 (VL-linker-VH) DNA fragment (sequence thereof was determined according to SEQ ID NO: 10 and SEQ ID NO: 12 in US20090099339A1 and obtained through whole-genome synthesis by Shanghai raygene biotechnology Co., LTD) as the template; and the amplified product was digested by NheI/NotI (purchased from NEB), linked with NheI/NotI-digested vector plasmid pCMV-V5-Fc (in the vector, the Fc fragmen",
    "/CD3The expression vectors pH-Y022/CD3, pH-806/CD3 and pH-C225/CD3 (see 201210094008.X) were transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells according to the procedure of FreeStyle MAX Reagent Transfection Reagent (from Invitrogen). And then the stable clones were screened according to OptiCHO\u2122 protein expression kit (from Invitrogen). Stable clones of CHO cells transfected with each of the above expression vectors were cultured in shake flasks at 37\u00b0 C. for 7 days at 130 rpm, and the used medium was CD OptiCHO (from Gibco). The culture supernatant was obtained by centrifugation and then stored at \u221220\u00b0 C.</p>Protein purification was performed using a histidine affinity column (His Trap HP column, available from GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's method steps. Specifically, the column was equilibrated with buffer A (20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4, 0.4 M NaCl) and then the cell culture supernatant (500 mL of the supernatant) was added to the column (1 mL) with a flow rate of 3 ml/min after dialysis against PBS. The column was then washed with 5 volumes of buffer A and 10 volumes of buffer A containing 50 mM imidazole to remove the impurity protein. The bound protein of interest was eluted with the same buffer A supplemented with 250 mM imidazole. All purification steps were performed at 4\u00b0 C.</p>Purified single-chain bifunctional antibodies were detected by reducing SDS-PAGE. As shown in FIG. 7, the molecular weights of these antibody molecules were all around 60 kD, which corresponded to the molecular weight of the single-chain bifunctional antibody calculated from the amino acid sequences.</p>Example 9. Analysis of Antigen Binding Specificity of Single Chain Bifunctional Antibody Such as Y022/CD3The binding capacities of single chain bifunctional antibody Y022/CD3 to EGFR were analyzed by fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) (BD, FACS Calibur).</p>Specific methods are as follows:</p>1. Tumor cells in logarithmic growth phase as listed in Table 2 were inoculated into a 6 cm dish with inoculation cell density of about 90%, and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. incubator overnight.</p>2. Cells were digested with 10 mM EDTA and cells were collected by centrifugation at 200 g for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in 1% phosphate buffered saline (NBS PBS) containing calf serum at a concentration of 1\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>to 1\u00d710<sup>7</sup>/mL, and added in a flow tube in an amount of 100 \u03bcl/tube.</p>3.
