    "at a later time (e.g., 7 days) to monitor the effect of the compound on metastasis. Primary tumor areas were measured twice weekly with a mechanical caliper. Tumor volume was calculated by the formula v \u2550 pab2/6, where a is the longest diameter and b is the next longest diameter perpendicular to a. A decrease in tumor volume or incidence of metastasis indicates the efficacy of the compound in this condition.</p>Murine model of radiation-induced pulmonary disease (RIPD)</p>Various models can be used to evaluate the efficacy of the compounds of the invention in restoring RIPD. For example, the bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis model described by Tokuda et al (Tokuda et al, J Immunol.164(5):2745-51 (2000)). Or the direct radiation-induced disease model described by Yang et al (Yang et al, Am J Respir Cell Mol biol.45(1):127-35 (2011)). Briefly, 10-12 week old, compound-treated or non-treated anesthetized mice were fixed, shielded with lead except for the thorax, and the animals were irradiated with 1.65Gy/min from a cesium source using a single 14.5Gy dose. At this dose, the survival rate was sufficient to obtain a sufficient number of animals for long-term analysis. The efficacy of the compounds is evaluated by a number of methods known in the art, including pulmonary mechanics assessment, pulmonary hydroxyproline levels, and the like.</p>In the following table, the structures and activities of representative compounds described herein are given.
