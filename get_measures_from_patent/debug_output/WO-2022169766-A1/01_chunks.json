In contrast, treatment with a bivalent IgG variant of Antibody I (i.e., Antibody III) did induce GITR pathway activation. \n\n[111] Example 7: Antibody In Vitro Antagonism of GITRL co-stimulation of T cell proliferation. </p>[112] One aspect of GITRL biology is its ability to co-stimulate T cells, resulting in increased proliferation. In this example, it is demonstrated that Antibody I and Antibody II treatment potently inhibits plate-bound GITRL co-stimulation of human T cell proliferation. Human CD3+ T cells were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and stimulated at 1.5e6 cells/mL with plate-bound 0.2 pg/mL anti-CD3 antibody for 4 days to increase GITR expression on T cells. T cells were then rested in culture medium for 2 days to prepare cells for restimulation. Activated and rested T cells at 1.5e6 cells/mL were then co-stimulated with plate-bound 2 pg/mL anti-CD3"
