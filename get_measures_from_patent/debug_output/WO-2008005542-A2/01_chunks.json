For example, a dipeptide (having a given pair of residues and a free carboxyl terminus) is covalently bonded through its \u03b1-amino group to the phosphorus or carbon atoms of the compounds herein. In certain embodiments, a phosphonate group substituted with an \n\n amino acid or peptide will be cleaved by the appropriate peptidolytic enzyme, leaving the carboxyl of the proximal amino acid residue to autocatalytically cleave the phosphonoamidate bond.</p>Suitable dipeptidyl groups (designated by their single letter code) are AA, AR, AN, AD, AC, AE, AQ, AG, AH, AI, AL, AK, AM, AF, AP, AS, AT, AW, AY, AV, RA, RR, RN, RD, RC, RE, RQ, RG, RH, RI, RL, RK, RM, RF, RP, RS, RT, RW, RY, RV, NA, NR, NN, ND, NC, NE, NQ, NG, NH, NI, NL, NK, NM, NF, NP, NS, NT, NW, NY, NV, DA, DR, DN, DD, DC, DE, DQ, DG, DH, DI, DL, DK, DM, DF, DP, DS, DT, DW, DY, DV, CA, CR, CN, CD, CC, CE, CQ, CG, CH, CI, CL, CK, CM, CF, CP, CS, CT, CW, CY, CV, EA, ER, EN, ED, EC, EE, EQ, EG, EH, EI, EL, EK, EM, EF, EP, ES, ET, EW, EY, EV, QA, QR, QN, QD, QC, QE, Qa QG, QH, QI, QL, QK, QM, QF, QP, QS, QT, QW, QY, QV, GA, GR, GN, GD, GC, GE, GQ, GG, GH, GI, GL, GK, GM, GF, GP, GS, GT, GW, GY, GV, HA, HR, HN, HD, HQ HE, Ha HG, HH, HI, HL, HK, HM, HF, HP, HS, HT, HW, HY, HV, IA, IR, IN, ID, IQ IE, ia IG, 1H, DC IL, IK, IM, IF, IP, IS, IT, IW, IY, IV, LA, LR, LN, LD, LC, LE, La LG, LH, LI, LL, LK, LM, LF, LP, LS, LT, LW, LY, LV, KA, KR, KN, KD, KC, KE, Ka KG, KH, KI, KL, KK, KM, KF, KP, KS, KT, KW, KY, KV, MA, MR, MN, MD, MC, ME, Ma MG, MH, MI, ML, MK, MM, MF, MP, MS, MT, MW, MY, MV, FA, FR, FN, FD, FC, FE, Fa FG, FH, FI, FL, FK, FM, FF, FP, FS, FT, FW, FY, FV, PA, PR, PN, PD, PC, PE, Pa ^G, PH, PI, PL, PK, PM, PF, PP, PS, PT, PW, PY, PV, SA, SR, SN, SD, SC, SE, Sa SG, SH, SI, SL, SK, SM, SF, SP, SS, ST, SW, SY, SV, TA, TR, TN, TD, TC, TE, Ta TG, TH, TI, TL, TK, TM, TF, TP, TS, TT, TW, TY, TV, WA, WR, WN, WD, WC, WE, WQ, WG, WH, WI, WL, WK, WM, WF, WP, WS, WT, WW, WY, WV, YA, YR, YN, YD, YC, YE, Ya YG, YH, YI, YL, YK, YM, YF, YP, YS, YT, YW, YY, YV, VA, VR, VN, VD, VC, VE, Va VG, VH, VI, VL, VK, VM, VF, VP, VS, VT, VW, VY and W.</p>Tripeptide residues are also useful as protecting groups.

The inhibitors will bind to locations on the surface or in a cavity of HCV polymerase having a geometry unique to HCV polymerase . Compositions binding HCV polymerase may bind with varying degrees of reversibility. Those compounds binding substantially irreversibly are ideal candidates for use in this method of the invention. Once labeled, the substantially irreversibly binding compositions are useful as probes for the detection of HCV polymerase . Accordingly, the invention relates to methods of detecting HCV polymerase in a sample suspected of containing HCV polymerase comprising the steps of: treating a sample suspected of containing HCV polymerase with a composition comprising a compound of the invention bound to a label; and observing the effect of the sample on the activity of the label. Suitable labels are well known in the diagnostics field and include stable free radicals, fluorophores, radioisotopes, enzymes, chemiluminescent groups and chromogens. The compounds herein are labeled in conventional fashion using functional groups such as hydroxy 1, \n\n ' carboxyl, sulfhydryl or amino.</",
    "aterials such as cell cultures.</p>The treating step of the invention comprises adding the composition of the invention to the sample or it comprises adding a precursor of the composition to the sample. The addition step comprises any method of administration as described above.</p>If desired, the activity of HCV polymerase after application of the composition can be observed by any method including direct and indirect methods of detecting HCV polymerase activity. Quantitative, qualitative, and semiquantitative methods of determining HCV polymerase activity are all contemplated. Typically one of the screening methods described above are applied, however, any other method such as observation of the physiological properties of a living organism are also applicable.</p>Organisms that contain HCV polymerase include the HCV virus. The compounds of this invention are useful in the treatment or prophylaxis of HCV infections in animals or in man.</p>However, in screening compounds capable of inhibiting human immunodeficiency viruses, it should be kept in mind that the results of enzyme \n\n assays may not correlate with cell culture assays. Thus, a cell based assay should be the primary screening tool.</p>Screens for HCV polymerase Inhibitors.</p>Compositions of the invention are screened for inhibitory activity against HCV polymerase by any of the conventional techniques for evaluating enzyme activity. Within the context of the invention, typically compositions are first screened for inhibition of HCV polymerase in vitro and compositions showing inhibitory activity are then screened for activity in vivo. Compositions having in vitro Ki (inhibitory constants) of less then about 200 X 10\"<sup>6</sup> M, typically less than about 100 X 10\"<sup>7</sup> M and preferably less than about 50 X 10\"<sup>8</sup> M are preferred for in vivo use.</p>Useful in vitro screens have been described in detail and will not be elaborated here. However, the examples describe suitable in vitro assays.</p>The compounds of the present invention have HCV CC50 values (\u03bcM) in the range of about 0.1 to about 1000, or about 0.1 to about 500, or about 0.1 to about 400, or about 0.1 to about 300, or about 0.1 to about 200, or about 0.1 to about 100, or less than about 500, or less than about 400, or less than about 300, or less than about 200, or less than about 100, or less than about 50, or less than about 20, or less than about 10.</p>The compounds of the present invention have HCV EC50 values (\u03bcM) in the range of about 0.1 to about 500, or about 0.1 to about 400, or about 0.1 to about 300, or about 0.1 to about 200, or about 0.1 to about 100, or about 0.1 to about 50, or less than about 500, or less than about 400, or less than about 300, or less than about 200, or less than about 100, or less than about 50, or less than about 20, or less than about 10.</p>Salts and Hydrates \n\n The compositions of this invention optionally comprise salts of the compounds herein, especially pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic salts containing, for example, Na<sup>+</sup>, Li<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>/ Ca<sup>+2</sup> and Mg<sup>+2</sup>. Such salts may include those derived by combination of appropriate cations such as alkali and alkaline earth metal ions or ammonium and quaternary amino ions with an acid anion moiety, typically a carboxylic acid. Monovalent salts are preferred if a water soluble salt is desired.</p>Metal salts typically are prepared by treating a metal hydroxide with a compound of this invention. Examples of metal salts which are prepared in this way are salts containing Li<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, and K<sup>+</sup>. A less soluble metal salt may be precipitated from the solution of a more soluble salt by addition of the suitable metal compound.</p>In addition, salts may be formed from acid addition of certain organic and inorganic acids, e.g., HCl, HBr, ^SO^ H3PO4 or organic sulfonic acids, to basic centers, typically amines, or to acidic group"
