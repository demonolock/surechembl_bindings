{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nFor binding assays, monolayers of MDBK cells were incubated with 5 nM <sup>125</sup> I-IFN\u03c4 in phosphate buffered saline with 1% BSA for 2 hours at 4\u00b0 C. in the presence or absence of a 1:30 dilution of sera containing antibodies raised against IFN\u03c4 peptides or the appropriate preimmune sera. \nSpecific binding of 36% was determined by competition with 500 nM unlabeled IFN\u03c4. \nTotal counts bound were 6850\u00b1133, and a 100-fold molar excess of OVIFN\u03c4 produced 4398\u00b1158 counts per minute. \nIn FIG. 17 the data from duplicate experiments are presented as the mean percent inhibition of OvIFN\u03c4 antiviral activity produced by antipeptide antisera relative to the appropriate preimmune sera \u00b1standard error. \nMonolayers of MDBK cells were incubated with 20 units/ml of OvIFN\u03c4 in the presence a 1:30 dilution of either preimmune sera or antisera to each of the OvIFN\u03c4 peptides described above. \nThe specific activity of the iodinated protein was 137 \u03bcCi/\u03bcg. \nData from three replicate experiments are presented in FIG. 18 as the mean percent reduction of OvIFN\u03c4 specific binding produced by antipeptide antisera relative to the appropriate preimmune sera \u00b1standard deviation."}
