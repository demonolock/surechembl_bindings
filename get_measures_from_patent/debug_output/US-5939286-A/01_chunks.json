    "tides blocked FIV RT activity, only the C-terminal peptide, OvIFN\u03c4 (139-172), was an efficient inhibitor of vesicular stomatitis virus activity on the feline cell line, Fc9. Thus the C-terminal regions of type I IFNs may bind to common site on the type I IFN receptor, while the N-terminal region may be involved in the elicitation of unique functions.</p>B. Anti-Peptide Sera</p>The ability of anti-peptide antisera to inhibit OvIFN\u03c4 antiviral activity was also determined. Antipeptide antisera inhibition of OvIFN\u03c4 antiviral activity was evaluated as follows. Monolayers of MDBK cells were incubated with 20 units/ml of OvIFN\u03c4 in the presence a 1:30 dilution of either preimmune sera or antisera to each of the OvIFN\u03c4 peptides described above. In FIG. 17 the data from duplicate experiments are presented as the mean percent inhibition of OvIFN\u03c4 antiviral activity produced by antipeptide antisera relative to the appropriate preimmune sera \u00b1standard error. Significant differences were assessed by analysis of variance followed by Scheffe's F test at p&lt;0.05. Consistent with peptide inhibition of antiviral activities, sera containing antibodies immunoreactive to OvIFN\u03c4 (1-37), OvIFN\u03c4 (62-92), and OvIFN\u03c4 (139-172) were also the most effective inhibitors of OvIFN\u03c4 antiviral activity, with antibodies directed against the N-terminal and C-terminal peptides being the most efficacious.</p>The same sera were also used to examine their effect on the binding of IFN\u03c4 to its receptor.</p>The IFN\u03c4 binding assay was carried out as follows. Five \u03bcg of IFN\u03c4 was iodinated for 2 minutes with 500 \u03bcCi of Na<sup>125</sup> I (15 mCi/\u03bcg; Amersham Corporation, Arlington Heights, Ill.) in 25 \u03bcl of 0.5 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 10 \u03bcl of chloramine-T (5 mg/ml) (Griggs, et al., 1992). The specific activity of the iodinated protein was 137 \u03bcCi/\u03bcg. For binding assays, monolayers of MDBK cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk. Cells were incubated with 5 nM <sup>125</sup> I-IFN\u03c4 in phosphate buffered saline with 1% BSA for 2 hours at 4\u00b0 C. in the presence or absence of a 1:30 dilution of sera containing antibodies raised against IFN\u03c4 peptides or the appropriate preimmune sera. Specific binding was assessed by incubation with a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled IFN\u03c4. Specific binding of 36% was determined by competition with 500 nM unlabeled IFN\u03c4. For example, total counts bound were 6850\u00b1133, and a 100-fold molar excess of OVIFN\u03c4 produced 4398\u00b1158 counts per minute. After incubation, the monolayers were washed three times, solubilized with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and the radioactivity counted. Data from three replicate experiments are presented in FIG. 18 as the mean percent reduction of OvIFN\u03c4 specific binding produced by antipeptide antisera relative to the appropriate preimmune sera \u00b1standard deviation. Significant differences were assessed by analysis of variance followed by Scheffe's F test.</p>The same sera (containing antibo"
