    "he synthetic substrate S-2366 (pyroGlu-Pro-Arg-pNA; CHROMOGENIX\u00ae) at a concentration of 0.0002-0.00026 M.</p>The Michaelis constant, K<sub>m</sub>, for substrate hydrolysis by each protease, was determined at 25\u00b0 C. using the method of Lineweaver and Burk. Values of K<sub>i </sub>were determined by allowing the protease to react with the substrate in the presence of the inhibitor. Reactions were allowed to go for periods of 20-180 minutes (depending on the protease) and the velocities (rate of absorbance or fluorescence change versus time) were measured. The following relationships were used to calculate K<sub>i </sub>values:</p>(v<sub>o</sub>\u2212v<sub>s</sub>)/v<sub>s</sub>=I/(K<sub>i</sub>(1+S/K<sub>m</sub>)) for a competitive inhibitor with one binding site; or</p>v<sub>s</sub>/v<sub>o</sub>=A+((B\u2212A)/1+((IC<sub>50</sub>/(I)<sub>n</sub>))); and</p>K<sub>i</sub>=IC<sub>50</sub>/(1+S/K<sub>m</sub>) for a competitive inhibitor</p>where:</p>v<sub>o </sub>is the velocity of the control in the absence of inhibitor;</p>v<sub>s </sub>is the velocity in the presence of inhibitor;</p>I is the concentration of inhibitor;</p>A is the minimum activity remaining (usually locked at zero);</p>B is the maximum activity remaining (usually locked at 1.0);</p>n is the Hill coefficient, a measure of the number and cooperativity of potential inhibitor binding sites;</p>IC<sub>50 </sub>is the concentration of inhibitor that produces 50% inhibition under the assay conditions;</p>K<sub>i </sub>is the dissociation constant of the enzyme:inhibitor complex;</p>S is the concentration of substrate; and</p>K<sub>m </sub>is the Michaelis constant for the substrate.</p>The selectivity of a compound may be evaluated by taking the ratio of the K<sub>i </sub>value for a given protease with the K<sub>i </sub>value for the protease of interest (i.e., selectivity for FXIa versus protease P=K<sub>i </sub>for protease P/K<sub>i </sub>for FXIa). Compounds with selectivity ratios &gt;20 are considered selective. Compounds with selectivity ratios &gt;100 are preferred, and compounds with selectivity ratios &gt;500 are more preferred.</p>The effectiveness of compounds of the present invention as inhibitors of coagulation can be determined using a standard or modified clotting assay. An increase in the plasma clotting time in the presence of inhibitor is indicative of anticoagulation. Relative clotting time is the clotting time in the presence of an inhibitor divided by the clotting time in the absence of an inhibitor. The results of this assay may be expressed as IC1.5x or IC2x, the inhibitor concentration required to increase the clotting time by 50 or 100 percent, respectively. The IC1.5x or IC2x is found by linear interpolation from relative clotting time versus inhibitor concentration plots using inhibitor concentration that spans the IC1.5x or IC2x.</p>Clotting times are determined using citrated normal human plasma as well as plasma obtained from a number of laboratory animal species (e.g., rat, or rabbit). A compound is diluted into plasma beginning with a 10 mM DMSO stock solution. The final concentration of DMSO is less than 2%. Plasma clotting assays are performed in an automated coagulation analyzer (Sysmex, Dade-Behring, Ill.). Similarly, clotting times can be determined from laboratory animal species or humans dosed with compounds of the invention.</p>Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) is determined using ALEXIN\u00ae (Trinity Biotech, Ireland) or ACTIN\u00ae (Dade-Behring, Ill.) following the directions in the package insert. Plasma (0.05 mL) is warmed to 37\u00b0 C. for 1 minute. ALEXIN\u00ae or ACTIN\u00ae (0.05 mL) is added to the plasma and incubated for an additional 2 to 5 minutes. Calcium chloride (25 mM, 0.05 mL) is added to the reaction to initiate coagulation. The clotting time is the time in seconds from the moment calcium chloride is added until a clot is detected.</p>Prothrombin Time (PT) is determined using thromboplastin (Thromboplastin C Plus, Dade-Behring, Ill.) following the directions in the package insert. Plasma (0.05 mL) is warmed to 37\u00b0 C. for 1 minute. Thromboplastin (0.1 mL) is added to the plasma to initiate coagulation. The clotting time is the time in seconds from the moment thromboplastin is added until a clot is detected.</p>The exemplified Examples disclosed below were tested in the Factor XIa assay described above and found having Factor XIa inhibitory activity. A range of Factor XIa inhibitory activity (Ki values) of \u226610 \u03bcM (10000 nM) was observed. Table 1 below lists Factor XIa Ki values measured for the following examples.</p>TABLE 1Example No.Factor XIa Ki (nM)138.69321.289&lt;5.0014579.8016332.2024169.629552.6030&lt;5.003421.4347&lt;5.00503372.0061341.906549.1666533.9078&lt;5.008020.1289&lt;5.0093950.9098132.20108&lt;5.00120291.10132&lt;5.0014624.8115036.97152100.001603530.00173&lt;5.001883862.00191&lt;5.00\nB. In Vivo Assays\n</p>The effectiveness of compounds of the present invention as antithrombotic agents can be determined using relevant in vivo thrombosis models, including In Vivo Electrically-induced Carotid Artery Thrombosis Models and In Vivo Rabbit Arterio-venous Shunt Thrombosis Models.</p>a. In Vivo Electrically-Induced Carotid Artery Thrombosis (ECAT) Model</p>The rabbit ECAT model, described by Wong et al. (J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 295:212-218 (2000)), can be used in this study. Male New Zealand White rabbits are anesthetized with ketamine (50 mg/kg+50 mg/kg/h IM) and xylazine (10 mg/kg+10 mg/kg/h IM). These anesthetics are supplemented as needed. An electromagnetic flow probe is placed on a segment of an isolated carotid artery to monitor blood flow. Test agents or vehicle will be given (i.v., i.p., s.c., or orally) prior to or after the initiation of thrombosis. Drug treatment prior to initiation of thrombosis is used to model the ability of test agents to prevent and reduce the risk of thrombus formation, whereas dosing after initiation is used to model the ability to treat existing thrombotic disease. Thrombus formation is induced by electrical stimulation of the carotid artery for 3 min at 4 mA using an ex"
