As known to the skilled person, the affinity of a binding molecule for its ligand (or binding partner), e.g. the affinity of an antibody for its target antigen, can be determined by the dissociation constant (K <sub>d</sub> ) Quantitatively defined. K of specific binding molecules (e.g., antibodies) <sub>d</sub> The value corresponds to the ratio of the rate of dissociation of the binding molecule (i.e., how fast it dissociates from its ligand) to the rate of association of the binding molecule (i.e., how fast it binds to its ligand). Lower K <sub>d</sub> The values correspond to higher binding affinities of the binding molecules for their ligands. Preferably, the specific binding molecules of the invention are bound in a K of less than 20nM, preferably less than 15nM or 10nM  <sub>d</sub> Binds to Anx-A1. Anx-A1 herein refers to any isoform of Anx-A1. In particular, it may refer to the isoform ANXA1-003.</p>Preferably, any specific binding molecule of the invention is bound at a K of less than 20nM, preferably less than 15nM or 10nM <sub>d</sub> Binds to Anx-A1. This is especially true if the specific binding molecules of the invention are antibodies. However, if the specific binding molecules of the invention are antibody fragments (e.g., scFv), in some embodiments, it may be possible to bind to Anx-A1 with an affinity slightly lower than that, i.e., K to which Anx-A1 binds <sub>d</sub> May be higher than 10nM, 15nM or 20nM, for example less than 40nM, but preferably less than 20nM.</p>K for binding of specific binding molecules to Anx-A1 <sub>d</sub> Preferably under binding conditions identified as optimal for the antibody Mdx001, which means Ca under su"
