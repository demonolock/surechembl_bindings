    "d and modified nucleobases.</p>The term \"% complementary\" as used herein, refers to the number of nucleotides in percent of a contiguous nucleotide sequence in a nucleic acid molecule (e.g., oligonucleotide) which, at a given position, are complementary to (i.e., form Watson Crick base pairs with) a contiguous nucleotide sequence, at a given position of a separate nucleic acid molecule (e.g., the target nucleic acid). The percentage is calculated by counting the number of aligned bases that form pairs between the two sequences, dividing by the total number of nucleotides in the oligonucleotide and multiplying by 100. In such a comparison a nucleobase/ nucleotide which does not align (form a base pair) is termed a mismatch.</p>The term \"hybridizing\" or \"hybridizes\" as used herein is to be understood as two nucleic acid strands (e.g., an oligonucleotide and a target nucleic acid) forming hydrogen bonds between base pairs on opposite strands thereby forming a duplex. The affinity of the binding between two nucleic acid strands is the strength of the hybridization. It is often described in terms of the melting temperature (Tm) defined as the temperature at which half of the oligonucleotides are duplexed with the target nucleic acid. At physiological conditions, Tm is not strictly proportional to the affinity (Mergny and Lacroix, 2003, Oligonucleotides 13:515-537). The standard state Gibbs free energy \u0394G\u00b0 is a more accurate representation of binding affinity and is related to the dissociation constant (Kd) of the reaction by \u0394G\u00b0=-RTIn(Kd), where R is the gas constant and T is the absolute temperature. Therefore, a very low \u0394G\u00b0 of the reaction between an oligonucleotide and the target nucleic acid reflects a strong hybridization between the oligonucleotide and target nucleic acid. \u0394G\u00b0 is the energy associated with a reaction where aqueous concentrations are 1M, the pH is 7, and the temperature is 37\u00b0 C. The hybridization of oligonucleotides to a target nucleic acid is a spontaneous reaction and for spontaneous reactions \u0394G\u00b0 is less than zero. \u0394G\u00b0 can be measured experimentally, for example, by use of the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) method as described in Hansen et al., 1965, Chem. Comm. 36-38 and Holdgate et al., 2005, Drug Discov Today. The skilled person will know that commercial equipment is available for \u0394G\u00b0 measurements. \u0394G\u00b0 can also be estimated numerically by using the nearest neighbor model as described by SantaLucia, 1998, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 95: 1460-1465 using appropriately derived thermodynamic parameters described by Sugimoto et al., 1995, Biochemistry 34:11211-11216 and McTigue et al., 2004, Biochemistry 43:5388-5405. In order to have the possibility of modulating its intended nucleic acid target by hybridization, oligonucleotides disclosed herein hybridize to a target nucleic acid with estimated \u0394G\u00b0 values below -10 kcal for oligonucleotides that are 10-30 nucleotides in length. In some embodiments the degree or strength of hybridization is measured by the standard state Gibbs ",
