    "m a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with therapeutic uses of the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or non-pro teinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the antibody will be purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method, and most preferably more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or non-reducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody\u2019 s natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, an isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step. </p> \"Binding affinity\" generally refers to the strength of the sum total of non-covalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g., an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, \"binding affinity\" refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1 : 1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., antibody and antigen). The binding affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y as used \n\n throughout the present specification, refers to the equilibrium dissociation constant (also referred to as\u201cbinding constant\u201d; KD) of a particular antigen-antibody interaction. The KD is the ratio of the rate of dissociation (k<sub>0ff</sub>) to the association rate (k<sub>on</sub>). Consequently, KD equals k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub> and is expressed as a molar concentration (M). It follows that the smaller the KD, the stronger the affinity of binding. Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art, including those described herein. Low-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to dissociate readily, whereas high-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain bound longer. A variety of methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art, any of which can be used for purposes of the present invention. Specific illustrative embodiments are described in the following. Typically, KD values are determined by using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), typically using a biosensor system (e.g. BIAcore\u2122) using methods known in the art (e.g. E.S. Day et al. Anal. Biochem. 2013, 440, 96-107), such as for example described in the Example section. Alternatively, the term\u201cbinding affinity\u201d may also refer to the concentration of antibody that gives half-maximal binding (ECso) determined with e.g. an ELISA assay or as determined by flow cytometry. </p> An antibody \"which binds\" an antigen of interest or antigens of interest, e.g. a SIRPa antigen target, is one that binds the antigen with sufficient affinity such that the antibody is useful as a therapeutic agent in targeting a cell or tissue expressing the antigen(s), and does not significantly cross-react with other proteins. For example, an anti-SIRPa antibody according to the present invention binds to human SIRPa - that is, at least to human SIRPai and human SIRPa<sub>B</sub>rr, preferably to cynomolgus SIRPa - and possibly to SIRPBi<sub>vi</sub> and/or SIRPBi<sub>V2</sub>, whereas it does not bind to SIRPy or unrelated proteins. In such embodiments, the extent of binding of the antibody to a \"non-target\" protein will preferably be less than about 10%, more preferably less than about 5%, more preferably less than about 2%, more preferably less than about 1% of the binding of the antibody to its particular target protein as determined by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis or radioimmunoprecipitati",
    "transepithelial migration. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is conceivable that anti-SIRPa blocking antibodies that also bind to SIRPBi may have opposite effects on SIRPa and SIRPBi. In order to obtain maximal stimulation of an anti-tumour cell response, there is a need for antibodies that stimulate the activity of innate immune cells (e.g. PMNs/neutrophils and/or macrophages) by blocking SIRPa, while limiting or avoiding affecting SIRPBi functioning, and simultaneously avoiding blocking adaptive immune cells, i.e. T-cells via binding to SIRPy. </p> The antibodies of the present invention preferably have all of the following characteristics: (i) they are able to block CD47 binding to SIRPa<sub>B</sub>rr and SIRPai, (ii) they do not bind to human CD3<sup>+</sup> T-cells, and (iii) they are able to reduce SIRPa signalling. Preferably, they have reduced or low binding to SIRPB i and/or SIRPBi<sub>V</sub>2 as measured by SPR. In contrast, known anti-SIRPa antibodies do not combine all desired specificities in a single antibody: all of the antibodies that are able to block CD47 binding to SIRPa<sub>B</sub>rr and SIRPai also show binding to SIRPy, whereas HEFLB is able to block SIRPai; n without binding to SIRPy, but does not have the ability to bind, let alone to block, SIRPai . Some other prior art antibodies that are able to bind both SIRPai and SIRPa<sub>B</sub>rr without binding SIRPy are not able to block CD47 binding to SIRPa and hence do not, or only at a high IC50 concentration, block SIRPa signalling as measured by blocking of the recruitment of SHP- 1. Despite being able to bind and block both SIRPai and SIRPa<sub>B</sub>rr, SE5A5 is not capable of blocking SIRPa signalling as measured by blocking of the recruitment of SHP-1. These characteristics are determined as described or referred to in the Examples. </p> In a first aspect, the invention provides an antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof that binds to SIRPa. An anti-SIRPa antibody of the invention preferably is an isolated antibody. Preferably, an anti-SIRPa antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof according to the invention binds to a primate SIRPa, more preferably to a human SIRPa, most preferably at least to the allelic variants SIRPai and SIRPa<sub>B</sub>rr. In a preferred embodiment, the antibody or antigen -binding fragment thereof has reduced binding as compared to prior art antibodies, more \n\n preferably has low binding, most preferably does not bind to SIRPy, preferably as measured using human CD3<sup>+</sup> T-cell FACS staining according to the Examples or as Biacore experiment as shown in the Examples. Preferably, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof increases the ADCC and/or ADCP of therapeutic antibodies. Preferably, an anti-SIRPa antibody of the invention increases the ADCC of 10 pg/ml of trastuzumab at 0.1 pg/ml of anti- SIRPa antibody at least 1.2; more preferably at least 1.3; more preferably at least 1.4; more preferably at l",
    "and specificity </p> Experimental </p> Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) assay: Affinity analysis was performed by single cycle kinetics analysis on a Surface Plasmon Resonance apparatus (BiaCore\u2122 T200 system, GE Life Sciences) at 25\u00b0C. Biotinylated SIRP antigens (SEQ ID NOs:51 - 56) were captured on the surface of a chip suitable for biotinylated molecules (Sensor Chip CAP, GE Life Sciences) by injecting 5 pg/ml of the SIRP antigen in running buffer (10 mM HEPES buffer at pH 7.4 with 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA and 0.005% v/v polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monolaurate (Surfactant P20) for 60 sec at 10 m\u0390/min after injection of a 20x diluted (in running buffer) biotin CAPture reagents (GE Life Sciences) for 60 sec at 10 m\u0390/min. Baseline stabilization was set at 1 min after which five increasing concentrations of an anti-SIRP antibody in running buffer were injected. For each step an association time of 150 sec was used, followed by a dissociation time of 600 sec after the highest concentration only, all at a flow rate of 30 m\u0390/min. Regeneration was performed with 6 M guanidine-HCl, 0.25 M NaOH solution (120 sec with flow rate of 30 m\u0390/min). Double blank subtraction was performed on the observed sensorgrams using a non anti-SIRP (blank) immobilized reference flow channel and running buffer injection. Sensorgrams were fitted with a 1: 1 Langmuir model for all tested anti-SIRP \n\n antibodies. The kinetic parameters (association rate [k<sub>a</sub>], dissociation rate [k<sub>d</sub>] and binding constant, also referred to as equilibrium dissociation constant or binding affinity [K<sub>D</sub>]) were calculated using BiaCore\u2122 T200 evaluation software (v3.1). </p> Flow Cytometry assay: U937 cells (human monocytic cell line) endogenously expressing human SIRPa<sub>B</sub>rr antigen and cells derived from a non-engineered subclone that has been screened and isolated from CHO-S Chinese hamster ovary cells (ExpiCHO-S) cells expressing either one of human SIRPcn, SIRPa<sub>B</sub>rr or cySIRPa antigen (100,000 cells/well in a 96- well plate) were washed three times with ice-cold FACS buffer (lx PBS (LONZA) containing 0.1% v/w BSA (Sigma- Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and 0.02% v/w NaN3 (Sigma- Aldrich), followed by the addition of a concentration range of each primary mAb (50 m\u0390/well) diluted in ice-cold FACS buffer. After an incubation time of 30 min at 4\u00b0C, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold FACS buffer and 50 m\u0390/well secondary mAb (for human antibodies, AffiniPure F(ab\u2019)2 fragment Go at- anti-human IgG-APC, 1:6,000 dilution, Jackson Immuno Research was added and for mouse antibodies, AffiniPure Fab fragment Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (H-i-L)-Alexa Fluor 488, 1: 1,000 dilution, Jackson Immuno Research was added).. After 30 min at 4\u00b0C, cells were washed twice and resuspended in 150 m\u0390 FACS buffer. Fluorescence intensities were determined by flow cytometry (BD FACSVerse, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and indicated as the median fluorescence intensity (MFI-Median) for U937 cells and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI-Mean) for ExpiCHO-S cells. Curves were fitted by nonlinear regression using the sigmoidal dose -response equation with variable slope (four parameters) in GraphPad Prism (version 7.02 for Windows, GraphPad, San Diego, CA). EC50 values were calculated as the concentration in pg/ml that gives a response half way between bottom and top of the curve, when using a 4-parameter logistic fit. </p>Results </p> SPR assay: The K<sub>D</sub> (i.e. binding constant, also referred to as\u2018equilibrium dissociation constant\u2019 or \u2018binding affinity\u2019) values for binding to human SIRPai (huSIRPai), human SIRPaBrr (huSIRPaBrr), cynomolgus monkey SIRPa (cySIRPa), human SIRPy (huSIRPy), human SIRPBivi (huSIRPBivi) and human SIRPBI<sub>V</sub>2 (huSIRPBiv2) of antibodies 1-13 and reference antibodies are summarized in Table 2. Antibodies 1-13 bind to both huSIRPa<sub>B</sub>rr and huSIRPai, and do not bind to huSIRPy. Some of antibodies 1-13, for example antibody 6, occasionally show weak association with SIRPy, but with a very low response unit (RU), which appears to be irrelevant as shown in the cellular binding experiments in the Examples below. Humanized HEFLB recognizes only the huSIRPa<sub>B</sub>rr variant and not huSIRPai and huSIRPy \n\n and cySIRPa. KWAR23, 29AM4-5, SE5A5 and 12C4 antibodies bind to all SIRP variants, including huSIRPy. </p>Table 2.

The K<sub>D</sub> values of cySIRPa, huSIRPy, huSIRPfii, and liuS I R Rb i , 2 were obtained from a concentration series 6.25-25-100-400-1600 ng/ml. n.r.: no response or below a 10 response unit (RU) cut-off of the calculated R<sub>max</sub>. When &lt; l.OE-11 M is given as K<sub>D</sub> value the sample could not be accurately determined because the affinity is outside the instrument range or the calculated K<sub>D</sub> was around l.OE-11 M, but surface saturation was seen. A K<sub>D</sub> value of &lt;1.OE-11 M means high affinity. # means sub-optimal fit to a 1: 1 Langmuir model was observed. </p>Flow Cytometry assay: The binding of various antibodies to huSIRPai, huSIRPct<sub>B</sub>rr, and/or cySIRPa expressed on cells was determined by flow cytometry. The binding is indicated as EC50 values, i.e. the antibody concentration in pg/ml that gives a response half way between bottom and top of the curve, which are shown in Table 3. Antibodies 1-13 bind to huSIRPa<sub>B</sub>rr (either transiently expressed in ExpiCHO-S cells or endogenously expressed in U937 cells) and huSIRPcu. Antibodies 1-4, 6, 12, 13 bind to cySIRPa in the low pg/ml range. These antibodies also bind, with the same EC50 value range (low pg/ml), to U937 cells endogenously expressing huSIRPa<sub>B</sub>rr. Reference antibodies KWAR23, KW AR23huIgG 1 LALA, 12C4huIgGiLALA, 12ChuIgGi, 29AM4-5huIgGiLALA and HEFLB show similar binding to huSIRPa<sub>B</sub>rr expressed on U937 cells. HEFLB does not bind to huSIRPai and cySIRPa. </p>Table 3.

Cells (200,000 cells/well in a 96-well plate) were subsequently incubated in the presence of tested antibodies or control conditions with secondary antibodies only (secondary goat anti -human IgG Alexa 633 F(ab\u2019)2 fragment, dilution 1:1000, Jackson Immuno Research, and secondary goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa 633 F(ab\u2019)2 ",

After an incubation time of 30 min at 4\u00b0C, the cells were washed twice with ice- cold FACS buffer. Then, 50 m\u0390/well secondary mAb was added (AffiniPure\u2122 F(ab\u2019)<sub>2</sub> fragment Goat-anti-human IgG-APC, 1:6,000 dilution, Jackson Immuno Research). After 30 min at 4\u00b0C, cells were washed twice and resuspended in 150 m\u0390 FACS buffer. Fluorescence intensities were determined by flow cytometry with the FACSVerse (BD Biosciences) and indicated as the median fluorescence intensity (MFI-Median) for U937 cells and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI-Mean) for ExpiCHO-S cells. Curves were fitted by nonlinear regression with a variable slope (four parameters) in GraphPad Prism (version 7.02 for Windows, GraphPad, San Diego, CA). EC50 values were calculated as the concentration in m g/ml that gives a response half way between bottom and top of the curve, when using a 4-parameter logistic fit. </p>Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) assay: Affinity analysis was performed by single cycle kinetics analysis on a BiaCore\u2122 T200 instrument (GE life Sciences) at 25\u00b0C. AVI-tagged \n\n biotinylated SIRP antigens were captured using the Biotin CAPture kit (GE life Sciences). The streptavidin surface was prepared by injection of biotin capture reagent. Subsequently biotinylated SIRP variants were injected in running buffer (lOmM HEPES buffer at pH 7.4 with 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA and 0.005% v/v Surfactant P20) to a capture level of approximately 40 - 50 response units (RU). After a 1 min baseline stabilization, five increasing concentrations of the anti-SIRPa antibodies were injected with an association time of 150 sec. The dissociation was observed for 600 sec, both at a flow rate of 30 m\u0390/min. The concentration range was chosen around the expected KD. Regeneration was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol with 6M guanidine-HCl, 0.25M NaOH solution. Double reference subtraction was performed on the obtained sensorgrams using a (biotin capture reagent bound) reference flow channel and a running buffer injection. Sensorgrams were fitted with a 1: 1 Langmuir model for all tested anti-SIRP antibodies. The kinetic parameters (k<sub>a</sub>, k<sub>d</sub> and KD) were calculated using the BiaCore\u2122 T200 evaluation software (v3.1). huSIRPBi<sub>vi</sub> and huSIRPBi<sub>v</sub>2 were tested in their monomeric form. Estimated KDS are within the tested concentration range. When &lt; 1.0E <sup>11</sup> is the reported KD value, the affinity could not accurately be determined because the kinetic parameters are outside the instruments specifications. </p>Results </p> Flow cytometry assay: A comparison of SIRPa antibodies for binding to huSIRPai and huSIRPa<sub>B</sub>rr expressed on cells was determined by flow cytometry. The binding is indicated as an EC50 value in Table 4. All antibodies tested here show binding to huSIRPa<sub>B</sub>rr (either transiently expressed in Expi-CHO-S cells or endogenously expressed in U937 cells) and huSIRPai. While most antibodies display an EC50 value in the low pg/ml range, AB115-LALA, 3F9-LALA and 7H9-LALA show an EC50 value that is greater than 1 pg/ml for binding to U937 cells. In addition, 3F9-LALA binds to huSIRPai and huSIRPa<sub>B</sub>rr expressed on ExpiCHO-S cells with an EC50 value greater than 1 pg/ml. Of note, corresponding isotype controls do not show binding to any of these cells. \n\n Table 4.

Binding of anti-SIRPa antibodies to primary cells: granulocytes, monocytes and T- cells </p> Experimental </p> Flow Cytometry assay, whole blood staining: Heparinized whole blood samples were obtained from healthy donors (Sanquin blood bank Nijmegen, the Netherlands) and were stored overnight at room temperature. Whole blood samples were lysed with IX BD FACS\u2122 Lysing Solution (349202, BD Biosciences)) for 15 min at room temperature and washed with FACS buffer (PBS containing 0,1% BSA and 2 mM EDT",
    "r (132 mM NaCl, 6 mM KC1, 1 mM CaCF, 1 mM MgSC&gt;4, 1.2 mM potassium phosphate, 20 mM HEPES, 5.5 mM glucose and 0.5% (w/v) human serum albumin, pH 7.4) and resuspended in a concentration of lxl0<sup>6</sup>/ml in isolation buffer (PBS+human albumin 1% buffer w/v, Human Albuman 200 g/ml, Sanquin Plasma Products B.V., Amsterdam, Netherlands), spun down and resuspended in FACS buffer (lx PBS (LONZA) containing 0.1% v/w BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and 0.02% v/w NaN3 (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells (100,000 cells/well in a 96-well plate) were washed with ice-cold FACS buffer followed by the addition of a concentration range of each primary mAb (50 m\u0390/well) diluted in ice-cold FACS buffer. After an incubation time of 30 min at 4\u00b0C, the cells were washed two times with ice-cold FACS buffer; next 50 m\u0390/well secondary antibody was added (for human antibodies, AffiniPure\u2122 F(ab\u2019)<sub>2</sub> fragment Goat-anti-human IgG-APC, 1:6,000 dilution, Jackson Immuno Research; for mouse antibodies, AffiniPure\u2122 Fab fragment Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (H-i-L)-Alexa Fluor 488, 1: 1,000 dilution, Jackson Immuno Research). After 30 min at 4\u00b0C, cells were washed twice and resuspended in 150 m\u0390 FACS buffer. Fluorescence intensities were determined by flow cytometry with the FACSVerse (BD Bio sciences) and indicated as the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI-Mean). Curves were fitted by nonlinear regression with variable slope (four parameters) in GraphPad Prism (version 7.02 for Windows, GraphPad, San Diego, CA). EC50 values were calculated as the concentration in pg/ml that gives a response half way between bottom and top of the curve, when using a 4- parameter logistic fit. \n\n Results </p> Flow Cytometry assay, whole blood staining: The binding of various SIRPa antibodies to primary cells was determined by flow cytometry. Dose-response curves for a representative healthy heterozygous SIRPai/SIRPa<sub>B</sub>rr donor are shown in Figure lOa-d. It should be noted that the exact height of the response is not necessarily a characteristic of the SIRPa antibody as this can also depend on the secondary antibody. Instead, EC50 values are independent of the detection antibody and should therefore be compared. A summary of the EC50 values is depicted in Table 6. All antibodies show binding to granulocytes and monocytes of heterozygous SIRPa<sub>B</sub>rr/ SIRPai donors, though exact EC50 values are varying. Except for HEFLB, all antibodies also show binding to granulocytes and CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes of the homozygous SIRPai donor with fluctuating EC50 values. These data are in line with the SPR and cellular data of Tables 2 and 3, where HEFLB also lacks binding to SIRPai. Circulating CD3<sup>+</sup> T-cells in the human blood do not express SIRPa or SIRPP but only SIRPy, and therefore CD3<sup>+</sup> T-cell binding can be interpreted as SIRPy binding. While most antibodies show binding to CD3<sup>+</sup> T- cells, antibody 6, AB3-LALA, 3F9-LALA, 7H9-LALA and HEFLB do not show binding to CD3<sup>+</sup> T-cells. In this whole blood staining assay, AB136-LALA shows binding to T-cells at higher antibody concentrations. This appears to be in alignment with the disclosure in WO2018/057669 that Abl36 binds to SIRPy, but with a low KD. Table 6. Cellular binding of anti-SIRPa antibodies to granulocytes, CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes and CD3<sup>+</sup> T-cells in whole blood of healthy heterozygous SIRPai/SIRPa<sub>B</sub>rr donors (al/aBIT) or a homozygous SIRPai/SIRPai donor (al/al). </p></p> &gt;10 = EC50 &gt; than 10 mg/ml </p> # = Excluded, resulted in an abnormal binding profile </p><sup>L</sup> = Dose-response curve is observed; however, the values are below isotype control </p> * = Incomplete curve (saturation not reached) </p> = Ambiguous fitting </p>Flow Cytometry assay, binding to isolated T-cells: To confirm SIRPy-dependent T-cell binding of various antibodies using another approach, isolated primary T-cells (in absence of SIRPa- or SIRPP-positive myeloid cells) were stained with the panel of antibodies. Results are shown in Figure 11. While most antibodies bind to T-cells, antibody 6, AB3-LALA, 3F9- LALA, 7H9-LALA, SE5A5 and HEFLB do not show binding to T-cells. Again, AB136-LALA shows binding at high antibody concentrations. Thus, the Examples above show that the affinity of antibody 6 for huSIRPPivi is lower than that of any of the comparative anti- SIRPa antibodies tested in the extensive panel listed above. Also, the affinity of non T-cell binding antibody 6 to S I R P b 1 <sub>v</sub> 1 was comparable to that of AB136-LALA, 7H9-LALA and HEFLB that also have low/no affinity for SIRPy and lower than that of AB3 and SE5A5 that also have low/no affinity for SIRPy. \n\n In aggregate, antibody 6 has a high potency of binding to both SIRPa-alleles while simultaneously showing relatively low or absent binding to the other non-inhibitory SIRP- family members SIRPB i, SIRPBI<sub>V</sub>2 and SIRPy. </p>6.
