    "ice homozygous for the KAT6B mutant allele have severe defects in cerebral cortex development resulting from a severe reduction in both proliferation and differentiation of specifically the cortical progenitor population during embryonic development. KAT6B is required for the maintenance of the adult neural stem cell population and is part of a system regulating differentiation of stem cells into neurons (Merson 2006). KAT6B is also mutated in rare forms of leukemia (Vizmanos 2003). </p> The MOZ locus ranks as the 12th most commonly amplified region across all cancer types (Zack 2013). MOZ is within the 8p11-p12 amplicon, which is seen at frequencies around 10-15% in various cancers, especially breast and ovarian (Turner- Ivey 2014). MOZ was first identified as a fusion partner of the CREB-binding protein \n\n (CBP) during examination of a specific chromosomal translocation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Avvakumov 2007; Borrow 1996). MOZ KAT activity is necessary for promoting the expression of MEIS1 and HOXa9, proteins that are typically seen overexpressed in some lymphomas and leukemias. Increased survival of MOZ<sup>+/-</sup> heterozygote mice in the Em-Myc transgenic model of B-cell lymphoma is seen, where loss of a single MOZ allele leads to a biologically relevant reduction in Meis1 and Hoxa9 levels in pre\u2013B-cells (Sheikh 2015). </p> Inhibitors of some MYSTs are known. For example, the following Anacardic acid derivative is reported (Ghizzoni 2012) as inhibiting TIP60 (IC50 = 74\u00b5M) and MOF (IC50 = 47\u00b5M): </p><img id=\"imgf000006_0001\" path=\"imgf000006_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/797180610/WO/20201224/A1/002020/25/49/46/imgf000006_0001.tif\"/></p> Other known inhibitors include (Zhang 2017): </p><img id=\"imgf000006_0002\" path=\"imgf000006_0002.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/797180743/WO/20201224/A1/002020/25/49/46/imgf000006_0002.tif\"/></p><img id=\"imgf000007_0001\" path=\"imgf000007_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/797180857/WO/20201224/A1/002020/25/49/46/imgf000007_0001.tif\"/></p> In light of the established role of KATs in general, and MYSTs in particular, in diseases such as cancer, a need exists for new inhibitors of these proteins.

Materials KAT enzymes were expressed using a baculovirus expression system and purified at Pfizer, La Jolla. Histone H3 (1-21) peptide (ARTKQTARKSTGGKAPRKQLA, SEQ ID NO:3) and Histone H4 (1-21) peptide (SGRGKGGKGLGKGGAKRHRKV, SEQ ID NO:4) were purchased from CPC Scientific (Sunnyvale, CA). Acetyl coenzyme A was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). All other biochemical reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or ThermoFisher Scientific (Waltham, MA). KAT Reactions KAT assays were performed at room temperature in assay buffer containing 1 \u00b5M AcCoA, 2 \u00b5M histone peptide, 10 mM Tris HCL pH 8.0, 2.5 mM NaCl, 0.5mM EDTA, 0.005% BSG and 0.02% Tween-20. 10 ul of 2x Histone peptide/AcCoA mix was added to a 384-well V-bottom polypropylene assay plate containing 0.5 ul of serially diluted test compound in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).
