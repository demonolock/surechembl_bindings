DefinitionsThe term \u201chuman TNF\u03b1\u201d (abbreviated herein as hTNF\u03b1, or simply hTNF), as used herein, is intended to refer to a human cytokine that exists as a 17 kD secreted form and a 26 kD membrane associated form, the biologically active form of which is composed of a trimer of noncovalently bound 17 kD molecules. The structure of hTNF\u03b1 is described further in, for example, Pennica, D., et al. (1984) Nature 312:724-729; Davis, J. M., et al. (1987) Biochemistry 26:1322-1326; and Jones, E. Y., et al. (1989) Nature 338:225-228. The term human TNF\u03b1 is intended to include recombinant human TNF\u03b1 (rhTNF\u03b1), which can be prepared by standard recombinant expression methods or purchased commercially (R &amp; D Systems, Catalog No. 210-TA, Minneapolis, Minn.). TNF\u03b1 is also referred to as TNF.</p>The term \u201cTNF\u03b1 inhibitor\u201d includes agents which interfere with TNF\u03b1 activity. The term also includes each of the anti-TNF\u03b1 human antibodies and antibody portions described herein as well as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,090,382; 6,258,562; 6,509,015, and in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 09/801,185 and 10/302,356. In one embodiment, the TNF\u03b1 inhibitor used in the invention is an anti-TNF\u03b1 antibody, or a fragment thereof, including infliximab (Remicade\u00ae, Johnson and Johnson; described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,656,272, incorporated by reference herein), CDP571 (a humanized monoclonal anti-TNF-alpha IgG4 antibody), CDP 870 (a humanized monoclonal anti-TNF-alpha antibody fragment), an anti-TNF dAb (Peptech), CNTO 148 (golimumab; Medarex and Centocor, see WO 02/12502), and adalimumab (HUMIRA\u00ae Abbott Laboratories, a human anti-TNF mAb, described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,090,382 as D2E7). Additional TNF antibodies which may be used in the invention are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,593,458; 6,498,237; ",
