    "dent and human ([16]; [17]).</p>Hedgehog proteins exert their function as part of the Hedgehog signaling pathway that is tightly regulated by many inhibitors at different levels. The Hedgehog receptor, Patched (Ptc) is a 12 transmembrane protein with a sterol sensing domain. The mammalian genome contains 2 patched genes, ptc1 and ptc2. In the absence of Hedgehog, Ptc binds and inhibits the function of Smoothened (Smo), a 7 transmembrane protein that functions as a co-receptor. Once Hh binds to Ptc, Ptc does not further inhibit Smo. Smo's activation in turn leads to the activation of fused (Fu), a serine-threonine kinase, and the disassociation of a zinc finger transcription factor of the mammalian Gli family (corresponding to Ci in Drosophila), from the microtubule-associated Fu-Gli-Su(fu) complex [Su(fu): Suppressor of Fused]. Gli proteins are large, multifunctional transcription factors, and their activities are intrinsically regulated. The uncomplexed Gli protein is then transported into the nucleus where it activates downstream target genes of the Hedgehog pathway including genes associated with cell cycle progression, the ptc1 and gli1 gene ([18]; [19, 20]; [21]; [22]; [23]).</p>The various Hedgehog proteins consist of a signal peptide, a highly conserved N-terminal region, and a more divergent C-terminal domain. During their passage through the secretory pathway, Hedgehog proteins are extensively modified: They undergo an internal autoproteolytic cleavage yielding a 19 kD N-terminal peptide and a 26-28 kD C-terminal peptide; the 19 kD peptide is then further modified at its N\u2014and C-termini by palmitoyl and cholesteryl adducts, respectively. These lipid modifications lead to a tight association of the 19 kD fragment with membranes. In addition, the diffusion of the 19 kD N-terminal peptide is further limited by binding to the Hip1, Patched1 (Ptc1) and Patched2 (Ptc2) transmembrane receptors, all of which are expressed on Hh responsive cells, and by interaction with heparin through an N-terminal basic domain. The C-terminal peptide on the contrary is freely diffusible. Yet, it is the 19 kD peptide that acts directly on distant cells in developing tissues. This remote action requires the transmembrane transporter-like protein Dispatched (Disp) for release of Hh from secreting cells and other proteins and enzymes.</p>Three Gli proteins have been identified in mammals (Gli1, Gli2, Gli3). Proteolysis of Gli2 and Gli3 results in the generation of strong repressors of gene transcription, whereas the Gli1 repressor seems to be weak. Shh inhibits repressor formation by Gli3, but not by Gli2, and the formation of potent activators of Gli2, and perhaps of other Gli proteins, depends on Hh signaling ([24-28]</p>Gli proteins can form Hedgehog signaling complexes with several other signaling components, including the kinesin-like protein Costal-2, Fu, and Su(fu) [29-33]. In these complexes Gli proteins are regulated by cytoplasmic sequestration, phosphorylation, and proteolysis. They can be found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, they are part of a multimolecular complex that is tethered to the cytoskeleton. In the absence of Hh, Gli proteins are cleaved by the proteasome, and C-terminally truncated forms termed \u201cGli repressors\u201d translocate to the nucleus, where they act as dominant transcriptional repressors. Upon Hh-induced Smo activation, Gli repressor formation is inhibited and full-length labile activators of transcription are made instead.</p>1.3.2 Involvement of Hedgehog in DiseasesPrior art describes involvement of Hedgehog in several diseases.",
    "ntional synthesis procedures. In these reactions, it is also possible to make use of variants that are in themselves known, but are not mentioned here.</p>3.2.1 Small Molecule InhibitorsSmall molecule antagonists of Hedgehog signaling have been described extensively in prior art. Formulas and methods of making the compositions are described in detail in the following U.S. patents and U.S. patent applications the specifications of which are expressly incorporated by reference herein: U.S. patent applications Ser. No. 20040110663 Dudek et al.: Hedgehog antagonists, methods and uses related thereto 20040060568 Dudek et al.: Hedgehog antagonists, methods and uses related thereto 20030022819 Ling et al.: Angiogenesis-modulating compositions and uses.</p>To summarize: In some embodiments of the present invention, a Hedgehog antagonist may be a small organic molecule. Such a small organic molecule may antagonize Hedgehog signal transduction via an interaction with but not limited to Hedgehog, patched (ptc), gli, and/or smoothened. It is, therefore, specifically contemplated that these small molecules which interfere with aspects of Hedgehog, ptc, or smoothened signal transduction activity will likewise be capable of inhibiting ocular neovascularization.</p>Thus, it is contemplated that in certain embodiments, these compounds may be useful for inhibiting Hedgehog activity. In preferred embodiments, the subject inhibitors are organic molecules having a molecular weight less than 2500 kD, more preferably less than 1500 kD, and even more preferably less than 750 kD, and are capable of antagonizing Hedgehog signaling, preferably specifically in target cells.</p>In certain preferred embodiments, the subject inhibitors inhibit Hedgehog-mediated signal transduction with an IC50 of 1 mM or less, more preferably of 1 .mu.M or less, and even more preferably of 1 nM or less. Moreover, the subject methods can be performed on cells that are provided in culture (in vitro), or on cells in a whole animal (in vivo).</p>Hedgehog antagonists include AY9944, triparanol, jervine, cyclopamine and tomatidine, compound A and compound B (U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/977,864).</p>In some embodiments, steroidal alkaloids are used to interfere with Hedgehog signaling. Steroidal alkaloids have a fairly complex nitrogen-containing nucleus. Two exemplary classes of steroidal alkaloids for use in the subject methods are the Solanum type and the Veratrum type. The above notwithstanding, in a preferred embodiment, the methods and compositions of the present invention make use of compounds having a steroidal alkaloid ring system of cyclopamine.</p>There are more than 50 naturally occurring veratrum alkaloids including veratramine, cyclopamine, cycloposine, jervine, and muldamine occurring in plants of the Veratrum spp. The Zigadenus spp., deathcamas, also produces several veratrum-type of steroidal alkaloids including zygacine. In general, many of the veratrum alkaloids (e.g., jervine, cyclopamine and cycloposine) consist of a modified steroid skeleton attached spiro to a furanopiperidine. Some veratrum-type alkaloids are depicted in FIG. 1.</p>An example of the Solanum type is solanidine. This steroidal alkaloid is the nucleus (i.e., aglycone) for two important gl",
    "uctures, and the possibility that certain unwanted side effects can be reduced by some manipulation of the structure, a wide range of steroidal alkaloids is contemplated as potential smoothened antagonists for use in the subject method.</p>In certain embodiments, the subject antagonists can be chosen on the basis of their selectively for the smoothened pathway. This selectivity can be for the smoothened pathway versus other steroid-mediated pathways (such as testosterone or estrogen mediated activities), as well as selectivity for particular Hedgehog/ptc/smoothened pathways, e.g., which isotype specific for ptc (e.g., ptc-1, ptc-2) or Hedgehog (e.g., Shh, Ihh, Dhh, etc.). For instance, the subject method may employ steroidal alkaloids which do not substantially interfere with the biological activity of such steroids as aldosterone, androstane, androstene, androstenedione, androsterone, cholecalciferol, cholestane, cholic acid, corticosterone, cortisol, cortisol acetate, cortisone, cortisone acetate, deoxycorticosterone, digitoxigenin, ergocalciferol, ergosterol, estradiol-17-a, estradiol-17-.beta., estriol, estrane, estrone, hydrocortisone, lanosterol, lithocholic acid, mestranol, .beta.-methasone, prednisone, pregnane, pregnenolone, progesterone, spironolactone, testosterone, triamcinolone and their derivatives, at least so far as those activities are unrelated to ptc related signaling.</p>In one embodiment, the subject steroidal alkaloid for use in the present method has a kd for members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily of greater than 1 .mu.M, and more preferably greater than 1 mM, e.g., it does not bind estrogen, testosterone receptors or the like. Preferably, the subject smoothened antagonist has no estrogenic activity at physiological concentrations (e.g., in the range of 1 ng-1 mg/kg).</p>In this manner, untoward side effects which may be associated certain members of the steroidal alkaloid class can be reduced. For example, using drug screening assays, the application of combinatorial and medicinal chemistry techniques to the steroidal alkaloids provides a means for reducing such unwanted negative side effects including personality changes, shortened life spans, cardiovascular diseases and vascular occlusion, organ toxicity, hyperglycemia and diabetes, Cushnoid features, \u201cwasting\u201d syndrome, steroidal glaucoma, hypertension, peptic ulcers, and increased susceptibility to infections. For certain embodiments, it will be beneficial to reduce the teratogenic activity relative tojervine, as for example, in the use of the subject method to selectively inhibit spermatogenesis.</p>In a preferred embodiment, the subject antagonists are steroidal alkaloids other than spirosolane, tomatidine, jervine, etc. In particular embodiments, the steroidal alkaloid is chosen for use because it is more selective for one patched isoform over the next, e.g., 10-fold, and more preferably at least 100-or even 1000-fold more selective for one patched path",
    ", smoothened or gli-1 mRNA will act as hedgehog antagonists, while methods that decrease the production of patched will have an agonist effect.</p>In certain embodiments, the subject antagonists can be chosen on the basis of their selectively for the hedgehog pathway. This selectivity can be for the hedgehog pathway versus other pathways, or for selectivity between particular hedgehog pathways, e.g., e.g., ptc-1, ptc-2, etc. In certain preferred embodiments, the subject inhibitors inhibit hedgehog-mediated signal transduction with an ED 50 of 1 mM or less, more preferably of 1 .mu.M or less, and even more preferably of 1 nM or less.</p>In particular embodiments, the small molecule is chosen for use because it is more selective for one patched isoform over the next, e.g., 10 fold, and more preferably at least 100 or even 1000 fold more selective for one patched pathway (ptc-1, ptc-2) over another.</p>In certain embodiments, a compound which is an antagonist of the hedgehog pathway is chosen to selectively antagonize hedgehog activity over protein kinases other than PKA, such as PKC, e.g., the compound modulates the activity of the hedgehog pathway at least an order of magnitude more strongly than it modulates the activity of another protein kinase, preferably at least two orders of magnitude more strongly, even more preferably at least three orders of magnitude more strongly. Thus, for example, a preferred inhibitor of the hedgehog pathway may inhibit hedgehog activity with a Ki at least an order of magnitude lower than its Ki for inhibition of PKC, preferably at least two orders of magnitude lower, even more preferably at least three orders of magnitude lower. In certain embodiments, the Ki for PKA inhibition is less than 10 nM, preferably less than 1 nM, even more preferably less than 0.1 nM.</p>The design of the RNAi expression cassette does not limit the scope of the invention. Different strategies to design an RNAi expression cassette can be applied, and RNAi expression cassettes based on different designs will be able to induce RNA interference in vivo. (Although the design of the RNAi expression cassette does not limit the scope of the invention, some RNAi expression cassette designs are included in the detailed description of this invention and below.)</p>Features common to all RNAi expression cassettes are that they comprise an RNA coding region which encodes an RNA molecule which is capable of inducing RNA interference either alone or in combination with another RNA molecule by forming a double-stranded RNA complex either intramolecularly or intermolecularly.</p>Different design principles can be used to achieve that same goal and are known to those of skill in the art. For example, the RNAi expression cassette may encode one or more RNA molecules. After or during RNA expression from the RNAi expression cassette, a double-stranded RNA complex may be formed by either a single, self-complementary RNA molecule or two complementary RNA molecules. Formation of the dsRNA complex may be initiated either inside or outside the nucleus.</p>The RNAi target gene does not limit the scope of this invention and may be any gene that participates in the hedgehog sign"
