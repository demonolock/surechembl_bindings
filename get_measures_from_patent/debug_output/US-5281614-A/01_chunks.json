    " invention form salts with various inorganic and organic acids and bases which are also within the scope of the invention. Such salts include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts like sodium and potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts like the calcium and magnesium salts, salts with organic bases; e.g., dicyclohexylamine salts, N-methyl-D-glucamine salts, salts with amino acids like arginine, lysine, and the like. Also, salts with organic and inorganic acids may be prepared; e.g., HCl, HBr, H<sub>2</sub> SO<sub>4</sub>, H<sub>3</sub> PO<sub>4</sub>, methanesulfonic, toluensulfonic, maleic, fumaric, camphorsulfonic. The non-toxic, physiologically, acceptable salts are preferred, although other salts are also useful; e.g., in isolating or purifying the product.</p>The salts can be formed by conventional means such as by reacting the free acid or free base forms of the product with one or more equivalents of the appropriate base or acid in a solvent or medium in which the salt is insoluble, or in a solvent such as water which is then removed in vacuo or by freeze-drying or by exchanging the cations of an existing salt for another cation on a suitable ion exchange resin.</p>Angiotensin II (A II) is a powerful arterial vasoconstrictor, and it exerts its action by interacting with specific receptors present on cell membranes. In order to identify A II antagonists and determine their efficacy in vitro, the following two ligand-receptor binding assays were established.</p>Receptor binding assay using rabbit aortae membrane preparation:</p>Three frozen rabbit aortae (obtained from Pel-Freeze Biologicals) are suspended in 5 mM Tris-0.25M Sucrose, pH 7.4 buffer (50 ml) homogenized, and then centrifuged. The mixture is filtered through a cheesecloth and the supernatant is centrifuged for 30 minutes at 20,000 rpm at 4\u00b0 C. The pellet thus obtained is resuspended in 30 ml of 50 mM Tris-5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> buffer containing 0.2% Bovine Serum Albumin and 0.2 mg/ml Bacitracin and the suspension is used for 100 assay tubes. Samples tested for screening are done in duplicate. To the membrane preparation (0.25 ml) there is added <sup>125</sup> I-Sar<sup>1</sup> Ile<sup>8</sup> -angiotensin II [obtained from New England Nuclear] (10 ul; 20,000 cpm) with or without the test sample and the mixture is incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 90 minutes. The mixture is then diluted with ice-cold 50 mM Tris-0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4 (4 ml) and filtered through a glass fiber filter (GF/B Whatman 2.4\" diameter). The filter is soaked in scintillation cocktail (10 ml) and counted for radioactivity using Packard 2660 Tricarb liquid scintillation counter. The inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of a potential AII antagonist which gives 50% displacement of the total specifically bound <sup>125</sup> I-Sar<sup>1</sup> Ile<sup>8</sup> -angiotensin II is presented as a measure of the efficacy of such compounds as AII antagonists.</p>Receptor assay using Bovine adrenal cortex preparation</p>Bovine",
    "50 mM), pH 7.7 buffer and homogenized. The homogenate is centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 15 minutes. Supernatant is discarded and pellets resuspended in buffer [Na<sub>2</sub> HPO<sub>4</sub> (10 mM)-NaCl (120 mM)-disodium EDTA (5 mM) containing phenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (0.1 mM)]. (For screening of compounds, generally duplicates of tubes are used). To the membrane preparation (0.5 ml) there is added 3H-angiotensin II (50 mM) (10 ul) with or without the test sample and the mixture is incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 hour. The mixture is then diluted with Tris buffer (4 ml) and filtered through a glass fiber filter (GF/B Whatman 2.4\" diameter). The filter is soaked in scintillation cocktail (10 ml) and counted for radioactivity using Packard 2660 Tricarb liquid scintillation counter. The inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of a potential AII antagonist which gives 50% displacement of the total specifically bound <sup>3</sup> H-angiotensin II is presented as a measure of the efficacy of such compounds as AII antagonists.</p>Receptor assay using rat brain membrane preparation</p>Membranes from rat brain (thalamus, hypothamus and midbrain) are prepared by homogenization in 50 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.4), and centrifuged at 50,000\u00d7g. The resulting pellets are washed twice in 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM Na<sub>2</sub> \u2022EDTA, 10 mM Na<sub>2</sub> HPO<sub>4</sub> (pH 7.4) and 0.1 mM PMSF by resuspension and centrifugation. For binding assays, the pellets are resuspended in 160 volumes of binding assay buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Na<sub>2</sub> HPO<sub>4</sub>, 5 mM Na<sub>2</sub> \u2022EDTA, pH 7.4, 0.1 mM PMSF, 0.2 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.018 mg/ml o-phenanthroline, 77 mg/ml dithiothreitol and 0.14 mg/ml bacitracin. For <sup>125</sup> I.Ile<sup>8</sup> -angiotensin II binding assays, 10 \u03bcl of solvent (for total binding), Sar<sup>1</sup>,Ile<sup>8</sup> -angiotensin II (1 \u03bcM) (for nonspecific binding) or test compounds (for displacement) and 10 \u03bcl of [<sup>125</sup> I]Sar<sup>1</sup>, Ile<sup>8</sup> -angiotensin II (23-46 pM) are added to duplicate tubes. The receptor membrane preparation (500 \u03bcl) is added to each tube to initiate the binding reaction. The reaction mixtures are incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 90 minutes. The reaction is then terminated by filtration under reduced pressure through glass-fiber GF/B filters and washed immediately 4 times with 4 ml of 5 mM ice-cold Tris HCl (pH 7.6) containing 0.15M NaCl. The radioactivity trapped on the filters is counted using a gamma counter.</p>Using the methodology described above, representative compounds of this invention could be evaluated and an IC<sub>50</sub> &gt;50 \u03bcM determined, thereby demonstrating and confirming the utility of the compounds of the invention as effective A II antagonists.</p>The antihypertensive effects of the compounds described in the present invention may be evaluated using the methodology described below:</p>Male Charles River Sprague-Dawley rats (300-375 gm) are anesthetized wit"
