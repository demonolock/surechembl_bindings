{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that meet the specified criteria in the provided text snippet. The text primarily discusses methods for forming salts, descriptions of biological processes, and assay procedures without providing specific molecule names, bioactivity metrics with numeric values, and units. \n\nHowever, one sentence comes close but lacks a specific molecule name and a numeric value with a unit for the metric:\n\nThe inhibitory concentration (IC50) of a potential AII antagonist which gives 50% displacement of the total specifically bound 125 I-Sar1 Ile8 -angiotensin II is presented as a measure of the efficacy of such compounds as AII antagonists.\n\nThis sentence does not meet the criteria because it does not provide a specific numeric value for the IC50 metric, only describing it as giving \"50% displacement,\" which implies an EC50 or similar metric rather than directly stating an IC50 value with a unit."}
