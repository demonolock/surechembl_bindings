The turbid suspension turned clear after the addition of tetrabutylammonium hydroxide was finished. The solvent was removed using a rotary evaporator to obtain a cream-colored viscous residue. To this residue was added appropriate amount of toluene, which was then removed using a rotary evaporator. Toluene was added to the residue once more and removed again. The solid obtained was dried in a vacuum oven overnight at 40\u00b0 C. to afford a white solid (64.1 g, 92% yield).</p>Diatrizoyl HEMA: To a stirring solution of KI (796.8 mg, 4.38 mmol) and 2-chloro ethylmethacrylate (4.32 mL, 32.1 mmol) in anhydrous DMF (122.6 mL) was added tetrabutylammonium diatrizoate (25 g, 29.2 mmol) under argon. The flask was place in a 60\u00b0 C. oil bath. Additional KI (199 mg) and 2-chloro ethylmethacrylate (1 mL) was added to the reaction at 13 hours, 38 hours and 41 hours reaction times. The reaction was pulled out of the oil bath at 44 hours and cooled under room temperature. The reaction was poured over saturated NaHCO<sub>3 </sub>aqueous solution (120 mL) and a white precipitate formed. The aqueous phase was extracted once with a mixture of ethyl acetate (280 mL) and methanol (50 mL). The organic phase was washed with saturated sodium chloride aqueous solution (300 mL\u00d71). The organic phase was subjected to rotary evaporation to obtain a cream-colored wet solid. The solid was suspended in a mixture of methyl tert-butyl ether and chloroform (7:3, v/v), and the resulting suspension was filtered to obtain a white solid. The solid dried under reduced pressure to obtain the first crop of product as a white solid (11.898 g). The previous NaHCO<sub>3 </sub>phase was filtered and a white solid was collected. The solid was washed with a mixture of methyl tert-butyl ether and chloroform (7:3, v/v) and dried under reduced pressure to afford the second crop (3.071 g). The first and second crops were combined to afford the final product as a white solid (14.969 g, 70.6% yield).</p>EXAMPLE 5Preparation of a Biodegradable Crosslinker<img id=\"EMI-C00031\" path=\"US20190151452A1-20190523-C00031.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/502615766/US/20190523/A1/020190/15/14/52/US20190151452A1-20190523-C00031.TIF\"/></p>To 10 g (67.6 1mnol)"
