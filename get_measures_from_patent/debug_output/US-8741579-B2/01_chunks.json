    "to the conformational arrangement of beta1 integrin, relates to the structural conformation of the extracellular domain assumed by beta1 integrin which is in a conformational equilibrium between the accepted high and low affinity binding conformational states which beta1 integrin can assume. In the intermediate state, beta1 integrin is not in a completely inactive state, however \u201cswing\u201d out of the hybrid domain, a process required for beta1 integrin to assume a high affinity conformation, is prevented. Further, the intermediate affinity state can be further characterised in that it maintains extracellular binding.</p>Without wishing to be bound by theory, the inventors predict that the selective allosteric modulation of beta1 integrin such that the extracellular domain assumes an intermediate affinity binding conformation can result in a reduction in caspase activation and cell death, and thus can confer significant associated benefits in terms of tissue repair and regeneration.</p>This intermediate affinity conformation state is equivalent to the conformation assumed by the integrin when it is under normal homeostatic conditions. Selective allosteric modulation of the beta1 integrin, in accordance with the present invention, can induce the reversal of structural and functional changes resulting from cellular insult and injury. Such changes are important in preventing ECM degeneration and in allowing tissue repair and regeneration. The inventors have identified that complete inhibition or blocking of beta1 integrin results in cell death as the cell becomes detached from the ECM. The modulation effected by the methodology and compositions of the present invention prevents detachment of a cell from the ECM, this permitting cell repair, due to the maintenance of ECM anchoring. Accordingly, the identification by the inventors that the targeted binding of the hybrid domain of the beta1 integrin can modulate beta1 integrin allostery, this causing a marked observed therapeutic benefit in terms of the prevention of cell death following tissue insult or injury, is significant in that it promotes cell survival and permits cell/tissue repair and regeneration.</p>The allosteric modulation of the beta1 integrin can be characterised and/or monitored in terms of the effect on downstream signalling and function mediated by and through beta1 integrin. Accordingly, allosteric modulation of the beta1 integrin such that it assumes an intermediate affinity conformational state may be further co-characterised by the occurrence of at least one of the following which serve to reduce, prevent or revert cellular damage which may be associated with ECM degradation, cellular injury or death and disease progression: (i) remodelling of the extracellular matrix (ECM), (ii) inhibition of caspase activation, and in particular caspase 3 and caspase 7 and an associated reduction in apoptosis, (iii) suppression of F-actin aggregate formation, this in turn preventing an increase in cytoskeletal tension (iv) improved cellular energy homeostasis resulting from a reversion to normal sinusoidal oscillation of ATP levels, and associated improved levels of ATP recycling within a cell, (v) maintenance of beta1 integrin expression levels, (vi) inhibition of caveolin-1 phosphorylation, this being an indicator of an alteration of the cytomechanics of the cell and/or the degradation of the ECM and a reduction in tethering forces, which can result in clustering or aggregation of receptors, and (vii) inhibition of cell membrane physicochemical changes. (increased stiffness as a result of increased sphingomyelinase activity leading to increased ceramide content and raft formation.</p>Allosteric modulation of beta1 integrin in accordance with the present invention may be further characterised in that an increase in perlecan results, as well as there being an initial increase in tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and a subsequent increase in pro-metalloproteinase-9.</p>In certain embodiments, the allosteric modulator compound can bind to beta1 integrin when beta1 integrin assumes any structural conformation, that is, the modulator compound can bind beta1 integrin irrespective of whether beta1 integrin assumes a low affinity (bent) or high affinity (extended) conformational state.</p>In certain embodiments, the allosteric modulator is selected from the group comprising of, but not limited to a: protein, peptide, peptidomimetic, nucleic acid, polynucleotide, polysaccharide, oligopeptide, carbohydrate, lipid, small molecule compound, aptamer, and naturally occurring compound such as a plant derived compound.

This domain contains a metal ion dependent adhesion site (MIDAS). The A domain of beta integrin is linked to the immunoglobulin-like hybrid domain.

    "ing tissue was treated with DMEM containing 40% foetal calf serum to inactivate the digestive enzymes and then washed using HEPES buffer. To isolate fibroblasts and smooth muscle cell populations, the tissue was then incubated in DMEM containing 1 mg/ml collagenase, 0.5% trypsin and 200 U/g DNAsI and maintained at 5% in an CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator. The cell suspension was washed as above and cells seeded on multiwell culture plates and maintained in DMEM containing 10% foetal calf serum.</p>Cultures were subjected to serum starving overnight in a medium containing 0.1% foetal calf serum. Some collagenase digested plated cells were co-cultured with isolated alveolar epithelial cells Transwells at the time of commencing the starvation.</p>Functional modifying antibody against beta1 integrin (Chemicon, clone JB1a, IgG<sub>1</sub>; also commercially available as JB1A mouse anti-CD29 (Integrin beta-1 subunit) IgG monoclonal antibody, unconjugated, clone JB1a, Millipore, Catalogue number MAB1965) was added to the cultures at a concentration of 1.44 and 0.48 \u03bcg/ml. The beta1 integrin stimulatory antibody clone TS2/16 (IgG1) was also added at 0.9 \u03bcg/ml for 1 hour to demonstrate the specificity of the JB1a action. After antibody addition to the cells in culture, the medium was aspirated and the cell layer rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS. The media was aspirated and preserved after the addition of protease inhibitors at \u221280\u00b0 C. In additional experiments, the effect of protein synthesis inhibition on beta1 integrin mediated proteoglycan increase was tested by pretreating the human lung derived cells with 25 \u03bcM cycloheximide. The effect of non-specific activation of metalloproteinases on beta1 integrin mediated proteoglycan increase was tested by pretreating the human lung derived cells with 0.5M APMA (aminophenylmercuric acetate). To investigate the involvement of selected metalloproteinases in initiating the response observed with beta1 integrin, specific neutralising antibodies for metalloproteinase-7 (1:1000, goat IgG, R&amp;D systems) and metalloproteinase-9 (1:1000 of clone 6-6B, mouse IgG1, Oncogene Research Products) were used.

    "therapeutic approach for treatment can be applied.</p>Significant components of the mechanism of action of beta1 integrin-mediated repair include the following:</p>A. The role of the actin cytoskeleton in beta1 integrin mediated repair in lung emphysema and in particular (i) the in-vitro findings which show an alteration in actin polymerisation, and (ii) the observation that changes in receptor movement can cause membrane disruption thus wounding the cell membrane. Integrin engagement in addition to calcium influx can cause a wide range of responses one of which is initiation of actin polymerisation to form a \u201csealant\u201d to be filled later with membrane microdomains. It has been reported that the induction of calcium oscillations rather than the net concentration protects from injury in adult tissue; a feature present in the developing tissues. The present experimentation has shown a similar phenomenon in ATP oscillation in two independent injury models. This part identifies the role of allosteric changes in beta1 integrin and its effects on cellular mechanics and cytoskeletal alterations in repair after injury in the lung.</p>B. The role of receptor clustering and/or altered diffusibility in injury and beta1 integrin repair. Recently, beta1 integrin-mediated adhesion was shown to regulate cholesterol-rich membrane microdomain internalisation mediated by phospho-caveolin-1. Gene disruption of caveolin-1 in mice resulted in pulmonary fibrosis as well as cytoskeletal changes and inhibition of focal adhesion kinases in-vitro. It has also been shown that in these mice there is impairment in liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy which was reversible by treatment with glucose. Experimentation was conducted in which epithelial-mesenchymal co-cultures were exposed to vehicle, elastase alone or in the presence of allosteric modifying anti-beta1 integrin antibody. Elastase induced caveolin-1 phosphorylation and this effect was inhibited by allosteric modulation of beta1 integrin. Furthermore, elastase resulted in a significant reduction in membrane associated beta1 integrin levels in two hours. Association of beta1 integrin with lipid-rich domains 3 hours after the addition of elastase was not detected. However, the presence of phospho-caveolin-1 in the heavy fractions of extracts from the elastase-injured cultures was detected. The addition of allosteric modifying anti-beta1 integrin antibody inhibited the elastase-induced changes.</p>Sphingomyelin is a ubiquitouse lipid of cell membranes with the plasma membrane containing 70-90% of total cellular content. Sphingomyelin is hydrolysed by sphingomyelinases (SMase) into ceramide and phosphocholine. Ceramide is degraded into sphingosine and fatty acid by ceramidases. To date there are five SMase isoforms; alkaline SMase, lysosomal acidic SMase (aSMase), secreted Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent acidic SMase, membrane-bound Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent SMase (nSMase), and cytosolic Mg<sup>2+</sup>-independent SMas",
    "attached and spread into an 8 individual wells (with 10 identical electrodes in each well), and then the current flows in the spaces under and between the cells, as the cell membrane are normal insulators. The base of the device has an array of gold film electrodes that connect to the ECIS electronics to each of the 8 wells. Firstly, pre-treatment was performed as a baseline for 2 hours prior to treatment to ensure that the drop in impedance induced by the change of media was recoverable. Elastase was then added, this resulting in an initial surge in mechanical impedance above control levels followed by time-dependent decrease at a rate faster than control and JB1a treated-elastase injured cells. Both effects were blocked by the JB1a monoclonal antibody (FIG. 12). These observations demonstrates that betas allosteric modulation induced repair in lung injury as a result of inhibiting membrane disruption due to clustering of cell surface receptors and/or altered membrane composition (due to increase ceramide) rendering it biophysically rigid.</p>Summary</p>The results of this example confirm that beta integrin is an effective target for tissue repair and regeneration in emphysema. The results show that allosteric modulation of beta1 integrin using a single dose of monoclonal antibody, induced functional and structural reversal of elastase-induced lung injury in vivo, and found that similar matrix remodelling changes occurred in human lung tissue. The results further identified inhibition of elastase-induced caspase activation, F-actin aggregate formation and changes in cellular ATP levels. This was accompanied by maintenance of beta1 integrin levels and inhibition of caveolin-1 phosphorylation. We propose that allosteric modulation of beta1 integrin-mediated mechanosensing prevents cell death associated with lung injury and progressive emphysema, thus allowing cells to survive and for repair and regeneration to ensue.</p>Example 2Functional Modulation of Beta1 Integrin via the Hybrid Domain Reverses Articular Cartilage Injury and Functional Impairment in a Mouse Model of ArthritisRheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects 0.8-1% of the population in developed countries. It is characterised by synovial proliferation and infiltration of inflammatory cells. This occurs in conjunction with angiogenesis leading to the formation of inflammatory pannus which contributes to bone erosion and cartilage thinning. The pathogenesis of RA has not been clearly defined. However, studies suggest that CD4+ T cell-mediated autoimmune responses play a critical role in the pathogenesis of RA. In addition, interferon gamma producing Th1 cells are though to be pivotal in the development of autoimmune arthritis in both humans and animal models.</p>Current disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapies have been shown to slow joint destruction in only a subpopulation of patients. Novel approaches have focused on specific modulation of the inflammatory response by targeting cytokines and their receptors. More recently, PI3K\u03b3 inhibitors have been reported to suppress joint inflammation and damage in a mouse model of RA. To date there has been no treatment targeting chondrocytes.</p>Articular cartilage is avascular tissue and is devoid of nerves and lymphatics. Cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis is dependent upon the interaction between chondrocytes and their surrounding ECM via cell surface adhesion receptors such as integrins. Normal chondrocytes express integrins \u03b1<sub>1</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>, \u03b1<sub>5</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>, \u03b1<sub>v</sub>\u03b2<sub>5</sub>, \u03b1<sub>v</sub>\u03b2<sub>3</sub>, and \u03b1<sub>3</sub>\u03b2<sub>1</sub>. In-vitro studies have demonstrated the importance of the interaction of \u03b21 integrin with ECM during mesenchymal condensation and chondrocytes differentiation. The administration of anti beta1 integrin antibodies to mouse limb mesenchymal buds has been previously shown to inhibit the formation of cartilage nodules. Furthermore, beta1 integrin inhibition in cartilage explants and also specific deletion of the beta1 integrin gene in mice in-vivo has been shown to cause a reduction in growth and collagen X deposition, accompanied by abnormal chondrocytes size, disorganised actin and increased apoptosis.</p>Without being bound by theory, the inventors hypothesise that in injury, beta integrin activation may occur as a result of fragmentation of the ECM. This might lead to cytoskeletal abnormalities, mitochondrial changes, altered ATP homeostasis and increased susceptibility to apoptosis. Failure of removal of apoptotic debris could act as a proinflammatory stimulus. In this setting integrin disengagement could be of therapeutic value.</p>Materials and Methods</p>Induction of Arthritis In-vivo</p>Animals were injected with either Freund's Complete Adjuvant (FCA, 100 \u03bcg in 20 \u03bcl) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis in paraffin oil (Sigma) or vehicle (heavy liquid paraffin oil; controls). Briefly, injections were carried out by transiently anaesthetising the animal (3% halothane in oxygen), a small incision was made over the stifle joint to allow visual identification of the patella tendon then using a 30-gauge needle mounted on a 50-\u03bcl Hamilton syringe, FCA, vehicle or JB1a (20 \u03bcl) was injected under the patella tendon and directly into the synovial space of the stifle joint. The animals were treated with JB1a (mouse anti-human IgG1, Chemicon), isotype control (IgG1, MOPC21, Sigma) or vehicle twice at weekly intervals start",
    "ied unilateral model of arthritis in mice induced by intra-articular administration of Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA, 100 ug) was studied (Gauldie, S. D., et al. J. Neurosci. Methods 139, 281-291 (2004)). This model resembles chronic rheumatoid arthritis but does not cause marked significant systemic effects or mobility and body weight changes.</p>Mice injected with FCA showed a significant increase in their ipsilateral joint diameter and hyperalgesia score on days 7, 14 and 21 compared to either vehicle-treated or sham animals (FIG. 12(a)). In mice injected with FCA followed by intra-articular injection of 60 mg of JB1a on days 7 and 14, the increase in the ipsilateral joint diameter and hyperalgesia score was abolished on days 14 and 21. The contralateral joint diameter and the hyperalgesia scores showed no significant change (FIG. 12(b),(c)).</p>Histologically, mice injected with FCA showed joint inflammation with cellular infiltrate, synovial proliferation, pannus formation and cartilage erosion (FIG. 12(d),(e),(f)). The JB1a treated group showed a significant amelioration in histological markers of damage; with a marked reduction in synovial thickness and cellular infiltrate. This was accompanied by the reversal of cartilage thinning and reduced pannus formation. No adverse effects were seen after the treatment with JB1a. This indicates that the reduction in hyperalgesia scores is not simply the result of previously described blockade of neuropathic pain by functional inhibition of beta1 integrin.</p>The prevalence of TUNEL positive cells in mouse joints following injury and treatment was then investigated. The experiments were performed in order to ascertain whether chondrocyte apoptosis and failure of removal of apoptotic bodies by phagocytosis may itself provoke further inflammation and autoimmunity. The results showed that background prevalence of apoptosis was low, and there was a significant increase in TUNEL positive cells in the ipsilateral joints: this was significantly reduced by treatment with JB1a monoclonal antibody (FIG. 12(g)).</p>To investigate the role of beta1 integrin in chondrocyte injury, primary human chondrocytes derived from the knee joint were cultured in 1.2% alginic acid for 2 weeks, then dispersed and allowed to attach to plastic before study.</p>FIG. 13(a) demonstrates that IL-1 beta (10 ng/ml) causes a significant increase in caspase 3/7 activity.

However, when IL-1beta was added with JB1a, caspase 3/7 activation was abolished.</p>Similar responses were obtained in experiments conducted using primary human chondrocytes cultured in alginic acid beads for 3 weeks (data not sho",

This in turn alters the cellular mechanical properties by increasing F-actin formation, decreasing ATP recycling, and cell surface tethering forces; all of which are known to contribute to mitochondrial and cellular damage. Taken together with the accompanying findings in emphysema, this provides new and unexpected insights into the principles of cellular injury and disease progression, leading to the identification of novel targets for therapeutics.</p>Summary</p>The results of Example 2 illustrate that direct modulation of beta1 integrin using the monoclonal antibody JB1a causes functional and structural amelioration of adjuvant-induced arthritis in vivo. It was further shown that such changes are associated with a reduction in chondrocyte apoptosis and restitution of normal cellular ATP fluctuation.</p>Example 3Functional Modulation of Beta1 Integrin Inhibits Beta Amyloid Fibril-induced Cell DeathThe main pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease are the formation of extracellular amyloid plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, and neurodegeneration. Amyloid plaques are mainly composed of tangles of beta amyloid peptide which is believed to play a causal role in Alzheimer's disease.</p>It has been demonstrated that amyloid beta deposition and neurotoxicity in human cortical primary neurons is mediated through alpha2beta1 and alphaVbeta1 integrins. It was further claimed that blocking beta1 integrin inhibits amyloid fibril formation via functional inhibition of adhesion via beta1 integrin. Although the beta 1 integrin binding epitope of the JB1a monoclonal antibody maps to the hybrid region of beta 1 integrin, there is a possibility that it may recognise another sequence in the A domain almost sandwiched between the MIDAS and the ADMIDAS (FIG. 17). Whether the real epitope could be discontinuous and/or combinatorial, remains unclear. Indeed the hybrid domain has been implicated in allosteric alteration and targeting residues within this region induced a low affinity physiological conformation.</p>In cultured primary human cortical neurons, 1-42 beta amyloid induced caspase 3/7 activation and an increase in GM1 staining indicative of raft formation (FIG. 15). Allosteric modulation of beta1 integrin using the JB1a monoclonal antibody ((JB1A mouse anti-CD29 (Integrin beta-1 subunit) IgG monoclonal antibody, unconjugated, clone JB1a, Millipore, Catalogue number MAB-1965) conferred protection against beta amyloid-induced apoptosis. This study further indicated that there was a marked morphological change in the presence of JB1a.</p>Experimental Methods</p>Primary human cortical neuron cultures: The HCN2 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). HCN2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were maintained at 37\u00b0 C. in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>For differentiation experiments, cells were cultured on collagen-coated glass coverslips. Diff"
