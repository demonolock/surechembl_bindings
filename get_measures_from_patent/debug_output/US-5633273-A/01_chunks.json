    "ptoms of the particular disease. The particular dose of compound administered according to this invention shall, of course, be determined by the particular circumstances surrounding the case, including the compound administered, the route of administration, the particular condition being treated, and similar considerations. The compounds can be administered by a variety of routes including the oral, rectal, transdermal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular or intranasal routes. A typical single dose for prophylactic treatment, however, will contain from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg of the active compound of this invention when administered orally. Preferred oral doses will be about 0.01 to about 3.0 mg/kg, ideally about 0.01 to about 0.1 mg/kg. When a present compound is given orally it may be necessary to administer the compound more than once each day, for example about every eight hours. For IV administration by bolus, the dose will be from about 10 \u03bcg/kg to about 300 \u03bcg/kg, preferably about 20 \u03bcg/kg to about 50 \u03bcg/kg.</p>The following experiments were conducted to demonstrate the ability of the compounds of Formula 1 to bind to 5-HT receptors. Such experiments demonstrate the utility of the compounds of Formula 1 in treating disease states (such as those noted above) which require alteration of 5-HT receptor function.</p>The affinities of certain of the compounds of Formula 1 at the central 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors were determined using a modification of the binding assay described by Taylor et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 236, 118-125(1986). Membranes for the binding assay were prepared from male Sprague-Dawley rats (150-250 g). The animals were killed by decapitation, and the brains were rapidly chilled and dissected to obtain the hippocampi. Membranes from the hippocampi were either prepared that day, or the hippocampi were stored frozen (-70\u00b0 C.) until the day of preparation. The membranes were prepared by homogenizing the tissue in 40 volumes of ice-cold Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4 at 22\u00b0 C.) using a Techmar Tissumizer (setting 65 for 15 sec), and the homogenate was centrifuged at 39800xg for 10 minutes. The resulting pellet was then resuspended in the same buffer, and the centrifugation and resuspension process was repeated three additional times to wash the membranes. Between the second and third washes the resuspended membranes were incubated for 10 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. to facilitate the removal of endogenous ligands. The final pellet was resuspended in 67 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, to a concentration of 2 mg of tissue original wet weight/200 \u03bcl . This homogenate was stored frozen (-70\u00b0 C.) until the day of the binding assay. Each tube for the binding assay had a final volume of 800 \u03bcl and contained the following: Tris-HCl (50 mM), pargyline, (10 \u03bcM), CaCl<sub>2</sub> (3 mM), [<sup>3</sup> H]8-OH-DPAT (1.0 nM), appropriate dilutions of the drugs of interest, and membrane resuspension equivalent to 2 mg of original tissue wet weight, for a final pH of 7.4. The assay tubes were incubated for 10 minutes at 37\u00b0 C., and the contents were then rapidly filtered through GF/B filters (pretreated with 0.5% polyethylenimine), followed by four 1 ml washes with ice-cold buffer. The radioactivity trapped by the filters was quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry, and specific [<sup>3</sup> H]8-OH-DPAT binding to the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> sites was defined as the difference between [<sup>3</sup> H]8-OH-DPAT bound in the presence and absence of 10 \u03bcM 5-HT.</p>The results of the evaluation of various compounds of Formula 1 in the test system described above are set forth in Table 1, below.
