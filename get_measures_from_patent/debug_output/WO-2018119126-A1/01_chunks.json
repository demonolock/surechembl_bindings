    "H3 and -NHC(0)NHCH3 are non-limiting examples of substituted amido groups. </p> [0088] The terms \"alkylsulfonyl\" and \"alkylsulfinyl\" when used without the</p>\"substituted\" modifier refers to the groups -S(0)2R and -S(0)R, respectively, in which R is an alkyl, as that term is defined above. The terms \"alkenyl sulfonyl\", \"alkynylsulfonyl\", \"arylsulfonyl\", \"aralkylsulfonyl\", and \"heteroarylsulfonyl\", are defined in an analogous manner. When any of these terms is used with the \"substituted\" modifier one or more hydrogen atom has been independently replaced by -OH, -F, -CI, -Br, -I, -NH2, -NO2, -CO2H, -CO2CH3, -CN, -SH, -OCH3, -OCH2CH3, -C(0)CH<sub>3</sub>, -N(CH3)<sub>2</sub>, -C(0)NH<sub>2</sub>, -OC(0)CH<sub>3</sub>, or -S(0)<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>. </p>[0089] As used herein, a \"chiral auxiliary\" refers to a removable chiral group that is capable of influencing the stereoselectivity of a reaction. Persons of skill in the art are familiar with such compounds, and many are commercially available. </p> [0090] The term \"effective,\" as that term is used in the specification and/or claims, means adequate to accomplish a desired, expected, or intended result. </p>[0091] The term \"hydrate\" when used as a modifier to a compound means that the compound has less than one (e.g., hemihydrate), one (e.g., monohydrate), or more than one \n\n (e.g., dihydrate) water molecules associated with each compound molecule, such as in solid forms of the compound. </p> [0092] As used herein, the term \"IC50\" refers to an inhibitory dose which is 50% of the maximum response obtained. This quantitative measure indicates how much of a particular drug or other substance (inhibitor) is needed to inhibit a given biological, biochemical or chemical process (or component of a process, i.e. an enzyme, cell, cell receptor or microorganism) by half. </p> [0093] An \"isomer\" of a first compound is a separate compound in which each molecule contains the same constituent atoms as the first compound, but where the configuration of those atoms in three dimensions differs. </p> [0094] The compositions may be administered one or more times. In some embodiments, the compositions are administered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 times or more. </p> [0095] \"Effective amount\" or \"therapeutically effective amount\" or \"pharmaceutically effective amount\" means that amount which, when administered to a subject or patient for treating a disease, is sufficient to effect such treatment for the disease. In some embodiments, the subject is administered at least about 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100 mg/kg (or any range derivable therein). </p> [0096] \"Pharmaceutically acceptable\" means that which is useful in preparing a pharmaceutical composition that is generally safe, non-toxic and neither biologically nor otherwise undesirable and includes that which is acceptable f"
