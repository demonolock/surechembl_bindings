    "in Normal Human Serum (NHS). The terminal components of the activated complement pathway will lyse the RBCs, and the amount of lysis (measured by absorbance) is used to directly determine the amount of complement activity. Human Recombinant CR1 (R&amp;D Systems) served as an internal positive lysis inhibition control and a concentrated mock transfection sample was used as a background lysis control. To calculate sample percent inhibition, EDTA and NHS (Complement Technology, Inc.) were used as the 100% lysis inhibition and 0% lysis inhibition values, respectively. Concentrated samples and internal controls were serially diluted 1 :2 in 40 pL ice cold GVB++ buffer (0.1 % gelatin, 5 mM Veronal, 145 mM NaCl, 0.025 % NaN3, pH 7.3; with 0.15 mM CaC12 and 0.5 mM \n\n MgC12, Complement Technology, Inc) in a 96-well, clear, V-bottom assay plate (Coming). RBCs (Complement Technology, Inc) were washed twice with fresh GVB++ and diluted in ice cold GVB++ to reach a final working concentration of 3.75E+08 cells per mL. A 40 pL volume of NHS diluted 1 : 50 in ice cold GVB++ followed by 40 pL of diluted RBCs were added to the appropriate wells. The assay plate was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 minutes and then centrifuged at 500x g, 4 \u00b0C for 5 minutes. After pelleting the RBCs, 100 pL of supernatant from each well was transferred to a 96-well, clear, flat-bottomed read plate. The end-point absorbance at 412 nm was read using a spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices) and the percent inhibition and EC50 for each sample dilution series was calculated. </p>[0584] Next, classical complement pathway inhibition (FIGs. 7A-7C, FIGs. 9A-9B) and alternative complement pathway inhibition (FIGs. 8A-8B) was measured using a Wieslab\u00ae Assay. </p>[0585] Classical Weislab </p>[0586] Transfection cell culture supernatant samples were screened for the inhibition of the human classical complement pathway using the Weislab Complement system Classical pathway ELISA (Svar). Human Recombinant CR1 (R&amp;D Systems) served as an internal positive inhibition control and a concentrated mock transfection sample was used as a background inhibition control. To calculate sample percent inhibition, EDTA and NHS (Complement Technology, Inc) were used as the 100% inhibition and 0% inhibition values, respectively. Concentrated transfection cell culture supernatant samples and controls were serially diluted 1 :2 in 40 pL of Diluent CP in a separate 96-well, non-binding dilution plate. An 80 pL volume of NHS diluted 1 :70 in Diluent CP was added to each well, then 100 pL of each sample + NHS mixture was transferred to the ELISA plate. The ELISA was then performed in accordance with the manufacturer instructions and the percent inhibition and EC50 for each sample dilution series calculated. </p>[0587] Alternative WeisLab </p>[0588] Transfection cell culture supernatant samples were screened for the inhibition of the human alternative complement pathway using the Weislab Complement system Alternative pathway ELISA (Svar). Human Recombinant CR1 (R&amp;D Systems) served as an internal positive inhibition control and a concentrated mock transfection sample was used as a background inhibition control. To calculate sample percent inhibition, EDTA and NHS (Complement Technology, Inc) were used as the 100% inhibition and 0% inhibition values, \n\n respectively. Concentrated transfection cell culture supernatant samples and controls were serially diluted 1:2 in 40 pL of Diluent AP in a separate 96-well, non-binding dilution plate. An 80 pL volume of NHS diluted 1 :70 in Diluent AP was added to each well, then 100 pL of each sample + NHS mixture was transferred to the ELISA plate. The ELISA was then performed in accordance with the manufacturer instructions and the percent inhibition and EC50 for each sample dilution series calculated. </p>[0589] The results of these assays are also shown in Table 3 below. </p>Table 3 - CR2-CR1 Fusion Construct Inhibition Assay \n<img id=\"imgf000110_0001\" path=\"imgf000110_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/1352871820/WO/20250116/A2/002025/01/53/17/imgf000110_0001.tif\"/>\n </p>[0590] Design round 2 constructs demonstrated better complement pathway inhibition activity than design round 1 constructs. Having two site 2 binding sites like native hCRl may improve activity. Design round 2 constructs had lower protein expression than design round 1 constructs. Proteins with (GGGGS)2 linkers between CR2 &amp; CR1 regions showed an unexpected high MW band in Western blot. \n\nExample 4 - CR2-CR1 fusion construct in vivo expression </p>[0591] The mRNA and protein expression of the constructs generated in Example 1 were analyzed in C57BL6/J mice. To prepare samples for analysis, whole C57BL6/J eyeballs from the study were homogenized using a bead-based homogenization method in complete lysis buffer (MSD lysis buffer plus Halt protease inhibitor cocktail and Halt EDTA). Total protein quantification was performed using the DC Protein Assay Kit II (Bio-Rad) with protein standard albumin as the standard curve to determine protein concentration for each sample. Lysates were diluted to either 0.250 mg/mL total protein or 0.500 mg/mL (optimal total protein concentration determined during Assay Development). </p>[0592] To m",

The data shows that the construct is successfully expressed in the eye at both concentrations tested, and that the CR2-CR1 fusion proteins can be successfully quantified. </p>Example 5 - Kinetics of CR2-CR1 fusion protein binding to target ligands using biolayer interferometry (BLI) </p>[0598] The binding kinetics of CR2-CR1 fusion proteins, human CR1, and human CR2 to their respective ligands were determined using biolayer interferometry (BLI) with a GatorPrime instrument (Gator Bio). Recombinant His-tagged human CR1 (R&amp;D Systems), human CR2 (R&amp;D Systems), or CR2-CR1 fusion proteins (GenScript) were immobilized onto Ni-NTA probes, and the response signals from the protein-loaded probes binding to C3d, iC3b, C3b, or C4b (Complement Tech) in a 7-point dilution series were measured for a 300 second association step, followed by a 300 second dissociation step in assay buffer. To reduce assay background/noise due to non-specific complement protein binding, a double reference was applied using a 0 nM ligand condition (Sample or Reference Probe Blank) and a series of Ni-NTA probes not loaded with protein (Reference Probe) according to the following equation: Sample Response = (Sample Signal - Reference Probe Signal) - (Sample Blank Signal - Reference Probe Blank Signal). The binding affinity constant, KD, and \n\n association/dissociation rate constants, k<sub>on</sub>/k<sub>o</sub>ff, for all binding interactions were calculated using the GatorOne software (Gator Bio). </p>[0599] Table 4 shows Equilibrium dissociation constants (KD), association rates (kon), and dissociation rates (koff) for complement receptor proteins binding to the CR1 ligands C3b and C4b of full length recombinant human CR1 protein (rhCRl) compared with CR2-CR1 fusion proteins. </p>Table 4 - Binding Kinetics for CR1 Ligands \n<img id=\"imgf000114_0001\" path=\"imgf000114_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/1352871821/WO/20250116/A2/002025/01/53/17/imgf000114_0001.tif\"/>\n </p>[0600] Table 5 shows equilibrium dissociation constants (KD), association rates (kon), and dissociation rates (koff) for complement receptor proteins binding to the CR2 ligands iC3b and C3d of full length recombinant human CR2 protein (rhCR2) compared with CR2-</p>CR1 fusion proteins. </p>Table 5 - Binding Kinetics for CR2 Ligands \n<img id=\"imgf000114_0002\" path=\"imgf000114_0002.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/1352871822/WO/20250116/A2/002025/01/53/17/imgf000114_0002.tif\"/>\n </p>[0601] Taken together, this data shows that the CR2-CR1 construct successfully binds to both CR2 and CR1 ligands of interest more strongly than rhCR2. \n\nExample 6 - Treatment of Stargardt disease in mice using AAV2-smCBA-CR2-CRl (Prophetic) </p>[0602] To evaluate the in vivo efficacy of AAV2-smCBA-CR2-CRl, 129Sl/SvlmJ mice and Abca4 knockout mice exhibiting phenotypic Stargardt disease will have the construct subretinally administered to reduce A2E accumulation. Abca4-/- mice model of Stargardt disease is like humans, including A2E accumulation and retinal degeneration. It is useful for studying retinal disorders like Stargardt disease or geographic atrophy. 129S1 mice have ocular anatomy that in some respects is like primate/human eyes and is ideal for investigating mechanisms of retinal degeneration. Retinal pigment epithelium, photoreceptors, and supportive matrices are present. Study design and treatment groups are shown in Tables 6 and 7. </p>Table 6 - Study Design \n<img id=\"imgf000115_0001\" path=\"imgf000115_0001.tif\" file=\"http",

Transgene mRNA expression in ocular tissues, despite minimal transgene protein, indicated consistent expression across timepoints. \n\nExample 9 - Analysis of binding to C3b, C4b, iC3b, and/or C3d using Surface Plasmon Resonance </p>[0685] Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Assay </p>[0686] The binding of recombinant human CR1, recombinant human CR2, and recombinant CR2CR1 #1 (SEQ ID NO: 22), and recombinant CR2CR1 #7 (SEQ ID NO: 12) protein to their respective ligands C3b, C4b, iC3b, and/or C3d was analyzed using a Biacore 8K SPR system (Cytiva). Histidine-tagged complement receptors and fusion proteins were immobilized onto Series S Sensor Chip CM5 using a His Antibody Capture Kit, with capture levels of 60-470 RU. C3b, C4b, iC3b, and C3d were prepared in l x HBS-EP buffer (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, and 0.05% v/v Surfactant P20), pH 7.4, at concentrations ranging from 3-16000 nM, and the analytes were injected at a flow rate of 30 pL/min. Binding at 25\u00b0C was monitored for 150 seconds, followed by a dissociation phase of 300 seconds. Chip sensors were regenerated for 60 seconds with 10 mM glycine-HCl buffer, pH 1.5. The data were processed and analyzed with Biacore Insight Evaluation Software; a 1 : 1 binding model (C3b analyte) or steady state affinity (C4b, iC3b, C3d analytes) was used to calculate the apparent KD value and other kinetic parameters. Results of the SPR analysis are presented in Table 12. </p>Table 12 - SPR Results \n<img id=\"imgf000130_0001\" path=\"imgf000130_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/1352871829/WO/20250116/A2/002025/01/53/17/imgf000130_0001.tif\"/>\n \n\n \n<img id=\"imgf000131_0001\" path=\"imgf000131_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/1352871830/WO/20250116/A2/002025/01/53/17/imgf000131_0001.tif\"/>\n </p>[0687] FIGs. 21 A-21C show surface plasmon resonance sensograms generated with the analyte C3b, with recombinant human CR1 as the ligand (FIG. 21 A), recombinant CR2CR1 #1 as the ligand (FIG.21B), or recombinant CR2CR1 #7 as the ligand (FIG. 21C). CR2CR1 #7 demonstrated comparable or higher binding affinity to C3b, iC3b and C3d, compared to the respective complement receptor hCRl or hCR2. In contrast, for C3b and C4b binding, CR2CR1 #1 demonstrated weaker binding than hCRl . CR2CR1 #7 exhibited approximately 3-fold higher affinity for C3b than CR2CR1 #1. Binding affinity for C4b was not obtained due to an assay failure. </p>[0688] Taken together, this data shows that the CR2CR1 #7 construct successfully binds to C3b, iC3b, and C3d more strongly than full-length recombinant CR1 or CR2. </p>* * * </p>[0689] The practice of the present disclosure will employ, unless otherwise indicated, conventional techniques of cell biology, cell culture, molecular biology, transgenic biology, microbiology, recombinant DNA, and immu"
