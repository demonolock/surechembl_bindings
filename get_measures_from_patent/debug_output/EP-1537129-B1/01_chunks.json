    " Akt at S473 and at native Akt after individual administration of the compounds to cancer cell lines. Phospho-specific antibodies only recognize kinases in an active state. Two cell lines were used that have high levels of constitutively active Akt, H1703 and H157. H1703 has wild type PTEN and H157 has mutant PTEN. Compounds SH5, 6, 13, 16, 23, 24, 25 decreased Akt phosphorylation without affecting native Akt levels.</p>All but SH16 also decreased Akt phosphorylation in the H157 cells. The lack of decreased phosphorylation observed with SH7 is important because SH7 is composed of only the ether lipid portion of these analogues and thus serves as a negative control. This data indicate that inhibition of Akt phosphorylation by some of the SH compounds is cell line specific, and that inhibition by SH5, 6, 13, 23-25 is not dependent on PTEN. Figure 1E shows that SH5, 6,23-25 inhibit Akt kinase activity, as well as Akt phosphorylation.</p>Figure 1F shows results on some of the compounds. SH5, 6, 23, 24, and 25 completely inhibited Akt phosphorylation in all three cell lines and were chosen for further analysis.</p>Figure 2A is a set of representative immunoblotting experiments with increasing doses of SH5, 6, and 24. For each set of immunoblotting experiments, densitometry was performed to quantify the decreased intensity of the bands observed with the S473 antibodies. Quantitative inhibition of S473 phosphorylation by different doses of these compounds is shown in Figure 2B. The IC50 values for these compounds (including SH23 and 25 (data not shown)) were similar, between 2-4 \u00b5M.</p>The SH compounds were tested against Akt and other kinases that are either upstream of Akt (PDK-1), downstream of Akt (c-Raf, 4EBP-1, p70S6K, FKHR, GSK-3, and/or AFX), or downstream of Ras (ERK, p38). Immunoblotting was carried out with phospho-specific antibodies to assess activation state of the kinases, and with native antibodies to assess changes in protein levels. Similar results were obtained with the H1703 (Figure 3A) or H157 cells (Figure 3B). SH5, 6, and 10 inhibited Akt phosphorylation without affecting native Akt levels. DPIEL and SH7 did not decrease Akt phosphorylation. Upstream of Akt, phosphorylation of PDK-1 was not affected by any SH compound. Of the downstream substrates, c-Raf phosphorylation and 4EBP-1 phosphorylation were decreased most. Decreased c-Raf phosphorylation correlated with increased ERK and p38 phosphorylation, which is consistent with the inhibitory effect of S259 phosphorylation by Akt on c-Raf activity. Of note, p38 phosphorylation was only decreased by DPIEL, indicating that the DPIEL used in these experiments was not inert.</p>SH 23-25 had similar effects in both H1703 (Figure 3C) and MB468 (Figure 3D) cells (H157 data not shown). In H1703 cells, phosphorylation of Akt, c-Raf, and 4-EBP-1 was decreased by SH23-25, but PDK-1 phosphorylation was unaffected. MB468 cells decreased Akt phosphorylation with administration of SH23-25 without"
