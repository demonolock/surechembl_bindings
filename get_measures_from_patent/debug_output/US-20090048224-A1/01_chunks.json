Membranes were prepared from CHO-d<sup>\u2212</sup>AQN cells stably transfected with human bradykinin B1 receptor cDNA. For large-scale production of membranes, cells were grown in 100 L suspension culture to 1.0E8 cells/mL then harvested using the Viafuge at continuous centrifugation of 1000g. For pilot studies, cells were grown in 2 L spinner culture and harvested by centrifugation (1900 g, 10 min, 4\u00b0 C.). The cell pellet was washed with PBS, centrifuged (1900 g, 10 min, 4\u00b0 C.), then the cells resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10% (w/v) sucrose, Complete Protease Inhibitor tablets (EDTA-free)) to a density of 14% w/v for passage through a microfluidizer (Microfluidics 110S, 3 passes, 6,000 psi). The resulting cell lysate was centrifuged (1900 g, 10 min, 4\u00b0 C.), and the crude particulate fraction isolated by centrifugation (142,000g, 1 h, 4\u00b0 C.) of the low-speed supernatant. The resulting pellet was resuspended in \u2153 the original lysis buffer volume, homogenized, and recentrifuged as above. The membrane pellet was resuspended by homogenization in storage buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10% (w/v) sucrose and Complete Protease Inhibitor tablets (EDTA-free)). Single-use aliquots were made and flash-frozen in liquid N<sub>2 </sub>prior to storage at \u221280\u00b0 C. Membranes containing human bradykinin B2R were purchased from Receptor Biology (now Perkin Elmer Life Sciences). They were derived from a CHO-K1 line stably expressing the human B2 receptor developed by Receptor Biology and subsequently purchased by Amgen. For some studies, membranes were prepared in-house from this same cell line using the method described for human B1 receptor membranes, except cells were grown in roller bottles and harvested using Cellmate.\n\nRadioligand Binding Assay for human B1 and human B2 bradykinin receptor. Human B1 receptor binding assay was performed in 96-well polypropylene plates (Costar 3365) by adding 50 \u03bcL [<sup>3</sup>H] des-arg<sup>10 </sup>kallidin (NET1064; Perkin Elmer Life Sciences) to 10 \u03bcL test compound diluted in 90 \u03bcl assay buffer (24 mM TES, pH 6.8, 1 mM 1,10 o-phenanthroline, 0.3% BSA, 0.5 mM Pefabloc SC, 2 \u03bcg/ml aprotinin, 5 \u03bcg/mL leupeptin, and 0.7 \u03bcg/mL pepstatin A). Membranes (50 \u03bcL) were added last. [<sup>3</sup>H] des-arg<sup>10 </sup>kallidin was diluted from stock into assay buffer to yield a final concentration of \u02dc0.3 nM in the assay but was adjusted as needed to ensure a concentration at or below the K<sub>d </sub>determined for each batch of receptor membranes. Nonspecific binding was defined with 2 \u03bcM des-Arg<sup>10</sup>Leu<sup>9 </sup>kallidin. Membranes were diluted in assay buffer to yield a final concentration of 0.068 nM hB1 receptor in the assay. Compounds were solubilized in either DMSO or ddH<sub>2</sub>O, plated into polypropylene plates (Costar 3365), then serially diluted in either DMSO or dilution buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, 0.1% BSA) to yield a final concentration of either 5% DMSO or no DMSO in the assay. The assay mixture was incubated with shaking for 1 hr at RT and then filtered through GF/C plates presoaked in 0.5% polyethyleneimine (Unifilter; Perkin Elmer Life Sciences) using a Filtermate 96-well harvester (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences). Filter plates were rapidly washed 6 times with 200 \u03bcl ice-cold buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4), dried in a vacuum oven at 55C for 15-20 min, backed, and 40 \u03bcL per well of Microscint 20 was added. The plates were sealed and activity read on Topcount (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences) using a count time of 3 min per channel.\n\nFor human B2 bradykinin receptor, the same procedure was followed with the following exceptions: [<sup>3</sup>H] bradykinin (NET706; Perkin Elmer Life Sciences) was used at a final concentration of \u02dc0.2 nM and non specific binding was defined with 2 \u03bcM bradykinin. Human B2 receptor concentration was 0.068 nM final in the assay.\n\nData analysis. Data was analyzed in XLFit with the four-parameter logistic y=A+((B\u2212A)/(1+((C/x)\u0302D))) and fit with the Levenburg-Marquardt algorithm. Raw cpm were converted to percent of control values prior to analysis (POC=((compound cpm\u2212nonspecfic cpm)/(no\u2212compound cpm\u2212nonspecific cpm)*100)). K<sub>i </sub>values were determined from the IC<sub>50 </sub>using the Cheng-Prusoff equation and K<sub>d </sub>values determined by direct saturation binding of the radioligands.\n\nThe compounds of examples 1, 1a, 1d-1f, 1 h, 3, 3b-3f, 3h-3j, 3l, 4a, 5a, 8, 13, and 15, have binding Ki's to the hB1 receptor at a level below 100 nm. The compounds of examples 1-15, have binding Ki's to the hB2 receptor at a level above 1 \u03bcM.\n</p>In Vitro B1-Inhibition ActivityA. In Vitro Assay of Human B1 Receptor Function Using Calcium Flux:</p>Activation of the G<sub>q </sub>linked B1 receptor results in an increase in intracellular calcium. The calcium sensitive photoprotein aequorin can, therefore, be used as an indicator of B1 receptor activation. Aequorin is a 21-kDa photoprotein that forms a bioluminescent complex when linked to the chromophore cofactor coelenterazine. Following the binding of calcium to this complex, an oxidation reaction of coelenterazine results in the production of apoaequorin, coelenteramide, CO<sub>2</sub>, and light that can be detected by conventional luminometry.</p>A stable CHO D-/hB1/Aequorin cell line was established and the cells were maintained in suspension in spinner bottles containing a 1:1 ratio of DMEM and HAM F12 (Gibco 11765-047), high glucose (Gibco 11965-084), 10% Heat Inactivated Dialyzed serum (Gibco 26300-061), 1\u00d7 Non-Essential Amino Acids (Gibco 11140-050), 1\u00d7 Glutamine-Pen-Strep (Gibco 10378-016), and Hygromycin, 300 \u03bcg/mL (Roche 843555). 15-24 h prior to the luminometer assay, 25,000 cells/well (2.5E6 cells/10 mL/plate) were plated in 96-well black-sided clear bottom assay plates (Costar #3904).</p>Media was removed from the wells and replaced with 60 \u03bcl of serum free HAM's F12 with 30 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) and 15 \u03bcM coelenterazine (Coelenterazine h Luciferin #90608 from Assay Designs). The plates were incubated for 1"
