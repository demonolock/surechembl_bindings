    " incubated with compound or 0.5% DMSO in media B for 48 hours in a tissue culture incubator at 37\u00b0 C.</p>At the end of the 48-hour incubation, the media was removed, and the replicon cell monolayer was washed once with PBS and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. prior to RNA extraction.</p>Culture plates with treated replicon cell monolayers were thawed, and a fixed amount of another RNA virus, such as Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) was added to cells in each well. RNA extraction reagents (such as reagents from RNeasy kits) were added to the cells immediately to avoid degradation of RNA. Total RNA was extracted according the instruction of manufacturer with modification to improve extraction efficiency and consistency. Finally, total cellular RNA, including HCV replicon RNA, was eluted and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. until further processing.</p>A Taqman real-time RT-PCR quantification assay was set up with two sets of specific primers and probe. One was for HCV and the other was for BVDV. Total RNA extractants from treated HCV replicon cells were added to the PCR reactions for quantification of both HCV and BVDV RNA in the same PCR well. Experimental failure was flagged and rejected based on the level of BVDV RNA in each well. The level of HCV RNA in each well was calculated according to a standard curve that is run in the same PCR plate. The percentage of inhibition or decrease of HCV RNA level due to compound treatment was calculated using the DMSO or no compound control as 0% of inhibition. The IC50 (concentration at which 50% inhibition of HCV RNA level is observed) was calculated from the titration curve of any given compound.</p>The IC50 values inhibitory activity of some of the compounds of the present invention is shown in Table 1 above.</p>EXAMPLE 8The Ki determinations were performed as follows. The Ki values for some compounds of the present invention are recited above in Table 1.</p>HPLC Microbore Method for Separation of 5AB Substrate and Products Substrate</p>NH<sub>2</sub>-Glu-Asp-Val-Val-(alpha)Abu-Cys-Ser-Met-Ser-Tyr-COOH Stock solution of 20 mM 5AB was made in DMSO w/0.2M DTT.
