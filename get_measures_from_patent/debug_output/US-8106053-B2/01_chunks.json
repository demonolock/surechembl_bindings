    "yl cellulose (40 g), and calcium stearate (4 g) were mixed, and compressed in a standard method so that each tablet contains 10 mg of the above compound.</p>Example 23Preparation of Capsules5-(3-cyclopentyloxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridazin-3-one (Table 1, Compound No. 3) (30 g), lactose (260 g), corn starch (66 g), and calcium stearate (4 g) were mixed, and then filled in gelatin capsules in a standard method so that each capsule contains 10 mg of the above compound.</p>Biological Experiment Example 1The Activity of Inhibiting PAI-1 Production Using Airway Epithelial CellsThe effect of a compound on PAI-1 production activity using airway epithelial cells was examined. This reflects PAI-1 concentration in the lung tissue related to fibrosis (lung).</p>The effect on the amount of PAI-1 produced using human airway epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) was examined. After 0.1 ml each of BEAS-2B cells prepared at 2\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml was added to a collagen I-coated 96-well plate, preincubated for 24 hours, 0.1 ml of a medium containing 10 \u03bcM TGF-\u03b2 was added thereto and incubated for 24 hours, the amount of PAI-1 in the culture supernatant was determined using an ELISA kit. The test substance was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (final concentration, 0.1% or less), and was prepared at 0.2, 1, 5 and 25 \u03bcM using a phosphate buffer, and added after preculturing. The activity of inhibiting PAI-1 production of the compound of the present invention was expressed in terms of the IC50 value and shown in Table 2.</p>TABLE 2PAI-1 production-inhibitingCompound No.activity, IC50(\u03bcM)114.1216.835.848.4124.01623.2</p>Biological Experiment Example 2The Activity of Inhibiting PAI-1 Production on the Bleomycin-Induced Pulmonary Fibrosis ModelIt has been reported that bleomycin administration into the trachea leads to pulmonary fibrosis. Its pathological findings including the hypertrophy and fibrosis of the alveolar wall, increased inflammatory cells, the increased amount of hydroxyproline etc. are similar to clinical idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and it has been often used as an experimental model of pulmonary fibrosis (Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 288, 747 (2001)). To C57BL/6 mice (6-week-old, female), bleomycin hydrochloride (Bleo: NIPPON KAYAKU CO., LTD) (6 mg/kg, 25 \u03bcl/animal) was injected into the bronchus together with 500 \u03bcl of compressed air. Three weeks after administration into the trachea, the amount of hydroxyproline in the lung was determined. 0.3 mg/kg of the test substance was suspended in 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose sodium, and orally administered once daily. The effect of the compound of the present invention was expressed in the inhibition percentage relative to the increased amount of lung hydroxyproline of the solvent-administration group, and shown in Table 3.</p>TABLE 3Inhibition percentage relative tothe increased amount of pulmonaryCompound No.hydroxyproline (%)266368684911719132</p>Biological Experiment Example 3Acute Toxicity StudyThe compounds of the present invention No. 1 to No. 21 were suspended in physiological saline"
