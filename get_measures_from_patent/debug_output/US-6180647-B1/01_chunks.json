    "no-2-phenylpiperidine dihydrochloride (Compound 21)</p>(i) (2S,3S)-2-Phenylpiperidin-3-amine dihydrochloride (Compound 20)</p>This compound was prepared according to the procedures disclosed in EP-558156.</p>(ii) (2S,3S)-3-(6-Methoxy-1-methyl-2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-7-yl)methylamino-2-phenylpiperidine dihydrochloride (Compound 21)</p>A mixture of compound 20 (250 mg, 1 mmol), compound 16 (220 mg, 1 mmol) and sodium triacetoxyborohydride (400 mg, 1.9 mmol) in CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2 </sub>(10 ml) was stirred at room temperature for 24 hr., quenched with NaHCO<sub>3 </sub>aq, and extracted with CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2 </sub>three times. The combined extracts were dried over Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>and concentrated. The crude was purified by a column chromatography on silicagel to give a free base of compound 21. This was derived to dihydrochloride salt with HCl\u2014MeOH, which was washed with IPA to give compound 21 (100 mg, 0.22 mmol, 22%) as a colorless crystal.</p>mp 265-268\u00b0 C.
