    " (also known as amphoterin) among others. RAGE mediates patho-physiologically relevant cellular changes in response to binding to these ligands. Transgenic animals overexpressing RAGE and human APP display early abnormalities in spatial learning and memory, indicating that RAGE is a cofactor for A\u03b2-induced neuronal perturbation in Alzheimer-type pathologies, and suggesting that RAGE is a potential therapeutic target to ameliorate cellular dysfunction.</p>The structure of RAGE has not been solved. Homology to other proteins leads to a model where RAGE has several domains. These domains are named in analogy to immunoglobulins: (i) V-like domain at the N-terminus: this equivalent domain in immunoglobulins binds antigen and represents the only binding region within these proteins. In RAGE, this domain binds to some ligands like S100 (Ostendorp et al. EMBOJ. 26,3875,2007; Leclerc et al. JBC 282,31317,2007). A monoclonal antibody binding to the v-like domain in RAGE competes with binding of different ligands S100b, HMGB1, and amyloid \u03b2 (WO2007109749(A2</patcit>)) implying that these ligands would also bind to RAGE via this same domain. (ii) First C2-like domain: Two domains within RAGE have homology to the C2 domains of immunoglobulins; one of these domains has been called C1 (nomenclature also used by Ostendorp et al. BBRC 2006). Several ligands binding to this domain have been described, for instance, S100A12 (also called ENRAGE or Calgranulin C), which binds with an affinity of Kd = 90 nM (Hofmann et al. Cell 97, 889, 1999; Xie et al. JBC, 282, 4218, 2007). A\u03b2 competes with S100A12 for this domain, suggesting that A\u03b2 also binds to the C1-domain. (iii) Second C2-like domain: this domain is called C2 (also used by Ostendorp et al. BBRC 2006). RAGE ligand S100A6 binds to the C2 domain and an antibody generated against a peptide from the C2 domain was shown to compete againt S 100A6 for this binding; the antibody lead to reduced signal transduction in SH-SY5Y (Leclerc et al. JBC 282,31317,2007).</p>A \"RAGE domain\" may be defined in line with different definitions provided in the state of the art:</p>According to Xie et al. 2007, J. Biol. Chem., Vol. 282:4218-4231 the following definition of h RAGE domains applies:\nthe V domain (amino acids 24-129 of SEQ ID NO: 60),the C1 domain (amino acids 130-234 of SEQ ID NO:60),the C2 domain (amino acids 235-336 of SEQ ID NO:60),</p>According to a more recent definition by Hudson et al, The FASEB Journal. 2008;22:1572-1580, h RAGE (404 amino acid residues according to SEQ ID NO:60) has an extracellular region (amino acids 1-342 of SEQ ID NO:60) composed of\na signal peptide (amino acids 1-22 of SEQ ID NO:60), followed by three immunoglobulin-like domains, includingan Ig-like V-type domain (amino acids 23-116 of SEQ ID NO:60) andtwo Ig-like C2-type 1/2 domains (amino acids 124-221 of SEQ ID NO:60; also designated C1 domain; and amino acids 227-317 of SEQ ID NO:60; also designated C2 domain);a single transmembrane doma",

The assay format for mAb affinity analysis was Fc-based capture via immobilized anti-Fc antibodies. A standard amine coupling protocol was employed to immobilize Fc-specific IgG via primary amines to the carboxy-methyl (CM) dextran surface of CM5 sensorchips (Biacore). For the study of mouse anti-RAGE mAbs, anti-mouse Fc (Biacore, anti-mouse, BR-1005-14) was used as the immobilized capture reagent and for the study of humanized anti-RAGE mAbs, anti-human Fc (Pierce 31125) was used as the immobilized capture reagent. An automated protocol, available on the Biacore 2000 and Biacore T100, was used to immobilize 8000-10000 RU of capture reagent in all 4 flowcells of the sensorchip. Briefly, the CM-dextran surfaces were activated by freshly prepared 1:1 50mM N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS):200mM 3-(N,N-dimethylamino) propyl-N-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC). Then the anti-Fc IgG capture reagent (20ug/ml in 10mM sodium acetate, pH4.5) was applied to the surface followed by deactivation of the surface and blocking of the residual reactive sites "
