    "ce information not found within the locus. </p> [0062] A \"promoter\" is a nucleotide sequence that directs the transcription of a structural gene. In some alternatives, a promoter is located in the 5' non-coding region of a gene, proximal to the transcriptional start site of a structural gene. Sequence elements within promoters that function in the initiation of transcription are often characterized by consensus nucleotide sequences. It is a region of DNA that initiates transcription of a particular gene. Promoters are located near the transcription start sites of genes, on the same strand and upstream on the DNA (towards the 5' region of the sense strand). Promoters can be about 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, or 1000 base pairs long or within a range defined by any two of the aforementioned lengths. As used herein, a promoter can be constitutively active, repressible or inducible. If a promoter is an inducible promoter, then the rate of \n\n transcription increases in response to an inducing agent. In contrast, the rate of transcription is not regulated by an inducing agent if the promoter is a constitutive promoter. Repressible promoters are also known. Without being limiting, examples of promoters can include a constitutive promoter, a heterologous weak promoter (e.g., a promoter that generates less expression than the endogenous promoter and/or a constitutive promoter) or inducible promoters. Examples can include EF1 alpha promoter, a PGK promoter, an MND promoter, KI promoter, Ki-67 gene promoter, and/or a promoter inducible by a drug such as tamoxifen and/or its metabolites. Commonly used constitutive promoters can include but are not limited to SV40, CMV, UBC, EF1 A, PGK, and/or CAGG for mammalian systems. </p> [0063] A weak promoter produces less mRNA expression than a stronger promoter, if both are driving expression of the same coding sequences. This can be compared by analyzing, for example, an agarose gel. An example of promoters subject to regulation by proximal chromatin is the EF1 alpha short promoter, which is highly active in some loci, but nearly inactive in other loci (Eyquem, Biotechnol Bioeng. 2013 Aug;110(8):2225-35. doi:\n\n </p> [0064] \"Transcriptional enhancer domain\" as described herein, refers to a short (50-1500 bp) region of DNA that can be bound by proteins (activators) to increase or promote or enhance the likelihood that transcription of a particular gene will occur or the level of transcription that takes place. These activator proteins are usually referred to as transcription factors. Enhancers are generally cis-acting, located up to 1 Mbp (1,000,000 bp) away from the gene and can be upstream or downstream from the start site, and either in the forward or backward direction. An enhancer may be located upstream or downstream of the gene it regulates. A plurality of enhancer domains may be used in some embodiments to generate greater transcription e.g., multimerized activation binding domains can be used to further enhance "
