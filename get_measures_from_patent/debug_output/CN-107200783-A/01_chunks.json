    "S are incubated respectively\uff084 DEG C, 30 min\uff09.Draw the Polymyxin-B of 30 \u03bc l mixings\uff08Sigma\uff09Into 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes, supernatant is removed in centrifugation, and 1 ml PBS are washed twice\uff087000 rpm, 2 min\uff09.Various protein samples are incubated with the Polymyxin-B after processing\uff084 DEG C, 5 min\uff09, centrifuge and remove supernatant, PBS is washed twice.Polymyxin-B precipitations are resuspended using 60 \u03bc l albumen sample-loading buffers, 100 DEG C are boiled 10 min, draw 10 \u03bc l and carry out Western blotting identifications, and be incubated HK antibody\uff08Hundred is strange biological\uff09.\n</p>As shown in Fig. 2 HK and LC can be combined with LPS, so as to be co-precipitated by polymyxin-B microballons, HK is pointed out to be combined by LC with LPS.\n</p>In order to further verify above-mentioned conclusion, using Biacore analysis methods, the affinity that HK and LC is combined with LPS is detected respectively.HK samples are diluted using the Running buffer of pH=7.4, a series of concentration are diluted to 0 nM, 6.4 nM, 19.3 nM, 57.7 nM, 173 nM, 520 nM.According to Biacore X100 control soft protocol, by HK albumen couplings to HPA chips, coupling level is 3000 RU.Setting sample injection time is 180 s, and Dissociation time is 500 s, and regenerated liquid is 0.1M HCl, and the recovery time is 120 s.According to Biacore X100 control soft protocol, examination with computer is carried out.\n</p>As shown in figure 3, HK, LC and LPS have physical directly in conjunction with Kd values are respectively 1.713*10<sup>-7 </sup>M and 1.524*10<sup>-9 </sup>M.The above results illustrate that compared with HK, LC and LPS adhesion are stronger, further prompting LC contain HK and LPS directly in conjunction with site.\n</p>It is which domain in LC is combined with LPS actually to further study, the 4th domain in LC is prepared for using Bac-to-Bac insect cell expression systems\uff08D4\uff09, the 5th domain\uff08D5\uff09With the 6th domain\uff08D6\uff09Albumen, and by Western blotting identifications.After being incubated using polymyxin-B microballons and D4, D5 or D6 albumen, the combination situation of itself and LPS is detected, only D5 can be co-precipitated by polymyxin-B, point out the binding site that D5 is HK and LPS, its result is as shown in Figure 4.\n</p>Then, 8 polypeptide fragments on D5 have been synthesized\uff08Nanjing Jin Sirui biotechnologies company\uff09, each polypeptide fragment, which is included, contains 30 amino acid.After 8 polypeptide fragments are incubated altogether with LPS respectively, then with LC interaction, then using ibid experimental method detection combine situation, only polypeptide 6 and polypeptide 7 can suppress LPS and LC combination, and its result is as shown in Figure 5.The amino acid sequence for comparing polypeptide fragment 6 and 7 understands that its shared sequence is DHGHKHKHGHGHGKH\uff08It is named as DHG15\uff09.\n</p>According to the literature, the polypeptide rich in histidine can neutralize the host inflammation caused by LPS and react, an"
