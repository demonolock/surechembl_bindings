{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\nFor example, these compounds have favorable binding affinities to the mGluR5 receptor (Ki values of less than about 10 nM), favorable anxiolytic activity in rats after oral administration (minimal effective doses of less than about 10 mg/kg p.o.), and the degree of oral bioavailability of these compounds in rodents exceeds 10.0%. \nSurprisingly, it was found that a unique subset of the compounds disclosed in hit. Pat. Appl. WO 2007/072095 has outstandingly high binding affinity to the mGluR5 receptor (Ki values are less than 10 nM) and possesses high anxiolytic activity in rats after oral administration (minimal effective doses are less than 10 mg/kg p.o.)."}
