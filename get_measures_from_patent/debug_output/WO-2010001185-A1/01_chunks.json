    "ly oral activity is an essential criteria for putative medicaments in terms of druglike properties and therapeutic applicability. Furthermore, beside oral efficacy and potency, oral bioavailability is also an important property. Low oral bioavailability (&lt;10%) may amplify individual differences in drug metabolism with the potential consequence of appearance of unwanted side-effects and/or loss of efficacy, hi searching for therapeutically applicable drugs we screened the compounds disclosed in Int. Pat. Appl. WO 2007/072095 for high mGluR5 binding affinity, in vivo efficacy after oral administration and acceptable oral bioavailability.</p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</p>The present invention relates to mGluRl and mGluR5 receptor subtype preferring ligands of formula (I):</p><img id=\"imgf000003_0001\" path=\"imgf000003_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/90784763/WO/20100107/A1/002010/00/11/85/imgf000003_0001.tif\"/></p>Wherein X is Cl or F and/or hydrates and/or solvates and/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof (i.e. or hydrates, solvates, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, or combinations thereof).</p>Surprisingly, it has been found that these compounds have particularly desirable properties for therapeutically-applicable drugs useful in one or more of the treatment, therapy, or prevention of conditions relating to modulation of mGluRl and mGluR5 receptors.

Pat.</p>Appl. WO 2007/072095 has outstandingly high binding affinity to the mGluR5 receptor (Ki values are less than 10 nM) and possesses high anxiolytic activity in rats after oral administration (minimal effective doses are less than 10 mg/kg p.o.). Furthermore, the degree of oral bioavailability of these compounds in rodents exceeds 10.0%. Conformity to these triple criteria represents definite advantage in terms of druglike properties and therapeutic or preventive applicability in conditions which require the modulation of mGluRl and mGluR5 receptors.</p>Compounds of formula (I) may form salts with acids. The invention relates also to the salts of compounds of formula (I) formed with acids, including without limitation the salts formed with pharmaceutically acceptable acids. The phrase \" a compound of formula (I)\" encompasses both the free base and the salt, even if the salt is not explicitly recited.</p>Both organic and inorganic acids can be used for the formation of acid addition salts. Suitable inorganic acids can be for example hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid. Representatives of monovalent organic acids can be for example formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, and different butyric acids, valeric acids and capric acids. Representatives of bivalent organic acids can be for example oxalic acid, malonic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid and succinic acid. Other organic acids can also be used, such as without limitation hydroxy acids for example citric acid, tartaric acid, or aromatic carboxylic acids for example benzoic acid o",
    "e a single dosage form may vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, a formulation intended for oral administration to humans may conveniently contain from about 0.5 mg to about 5 g of active agent, \n\n compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about 95 percent of the total composition. Unit dosage forms may generally contain between from about 1 mg to about 1000 mg of the active ingredient, for example 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 250-300 mg, 400 mg, 500 mg, 600 mg, 800 mg or 1000 mg. It is understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy.</p>Medical use</p>The compounds of formula (I) and/or physiologically acceptable salts and/or hydrates and/or solvates of the present invention have been found to exhibit biological activity at mGluRl and mGluR5 receptors and are expected to be useful in the treatment of mGluRl and mGluR5 mediated disorders.</p>It has been found that the compounds according to the present invention or salts thereof, exhibit a high degree of potency and selectivity for mGluRl and mGluR5 receptors.
