EP 520722, EP 566226, EP 787772, EP 837063, and EP 682027; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,747,498, 5,789,427, 5,650,415, and 5,656,643; and German Patent Application No. DE 19629652. Additional non-limiting examples of low molecular weight EGFR kinase inhibitors include any of the EGFR kinase inhibitors described in Traxler, P., 1998, Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents 8(12):1599-1625. </p> Specific preferred examples of low molecular weight EGFR kinase inhibitors that can be used according to the present invention include [6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)-4-quinazolin-4-yl]-(3-ethynylphenyl) amine (also known as OSI-774, erlotinib, or TARCEVA\u2122 (erlotinib HCl); OSI Pharmaceuticals/Genentech/Roche) (U.S. Pat. No. 5,747,498; International Patent Publication No. WO 01/34574, and Moyer, J. D. et al. (1997) Cancer Res. 57:4838-4848); CI-1033 (formerly known as PD183805; Pfizer) (Sherwood et al., 1999, Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 40:723); PD-158780 (Pfizer); AG-1478 (University of California); CGP-59326 (Novartis); PKI-166 (Novartis); EKB-569 (Wyeth); GW-2016 (also known as GW-572016 or lapatinib ditosylate; GSK); and gefitinib (also known as ZD1839 or IRESSA\u2122; Astrazeneca) (Woodburn et al., 1997, Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 38:633). A particularly preferred low molecular weight EGFR kinase inhibitor that can be used according to the present invention is [6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)-4-quinazolin-4-yl]-(3-ethynylphenyl) amine (i.e. erlotinib), its hydrochloride salt (i.e. erlotinib HCl, TARCEVA\u2122), or other salt forms (e.g. erlotinib mesylate). </p> Antibody-based EGFR kinase inhibitors include any anti-EGFR antibody or antibody fragment that can partially or completely block EGFR activation by its natural ligand. Non-limiting examples of antibody-based EGFR kinase inhibitors include those described in Modjtahedi, H., et al., 1993, Br. J. Cancer 67:247-253; Teramoto, T., et al., 1996, Cancer 77:639-645; Goldstein et al., 1995, Clin. Cancer Res. 1:1311-1318; Huang, S. M., et al., 1999, Cancer Res. 15:59(8):1935-40; and Yang, X., et al., 1999, Cancer Res. 59:1236-1243. Thus, the EGFR kinase inhibitor can be the monoclonal antibody Mab E7.6.3 (Yang, X. D. et al. (1999) Cancer Res. 59:1236-43), or Mab C225 (ATCC Accession No. HB-8508), or an antibody or antibody fragment having the binding specificity thereof. Suitable monoclonal antibody EGFR kinase inhibitors include, but are not limited to, IMC-C225 (also known as cetuximab or ERBITUX\u2122; Imclone Systems), ABX-EGF (Abgenix), EMD 72000 (Merck K",
    "ogrank)Hazard ratio (HR)\u20020.37\u20021.6395% CI for HR(0.19, 0.73)(0.50, 5.33)\n</p> Conclusion </p> The loss of E-cadherin expression and the acquisition of a more mesenchymal phenotype has been shown to correlate with poor prognosis in multiple epithelial-derived solid tumors. The loss of E-cadherin and to a lesser extent \u03b3-catenin and Brk correlated with cellular and xenograft insensitivity to EGF receptor inhibition. Conversely the cellular acquisition of mesenchymal markers, vimentin, fibronectin or fibrillin correlates with a loss of sensitivity to EGF receptor inhibitors. We clearly show that a partial or complete epithelial to mesenchymal transition negatively impacts cellular responses to EGF receptor inhibitors in vitro and in xenografts and serves a diagnostic for patients most likely to benefit from EGF receptor kinase inhibitors and anti-EGF receptor antibody therapies. </p> Abbreviations </p> EGF, epidermal growth factor; EMT, epithelial to mesenchymal transition; NSCLC, non-small cell lung carcinoma; HNSCC, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; CRC, colorectal cancer; MBC, metastatic breast cancer; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; Brk, Breast tumor kinase (also known as protein tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6)); LC, liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1; TGF\u03b1, transforming growth factor alpha; HB-EGF, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; TGF\u03b1, transforming growth factor alpha; IC<sub>50</sub>, half maximal inhibitory concentration; pY, phosphotyrosine; wt, wild-type; PI3K, phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase; GAPDH, Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. </p> Incorporation by Reference </p> All patents, published patent applications and other references disclosed herein are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. </p> Equivalents </p> Those skilled in the art will recognize, or be able to ascertain, using no more than routine experimentation, many equivalents to specific embodiments of the invention described specifically herein.
