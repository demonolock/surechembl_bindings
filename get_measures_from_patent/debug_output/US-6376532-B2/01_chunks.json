    "enzodiazepine, nicotine), foods or other substances.</p>Additionally, compounds of the invention may be useful as pharmacological tools for the further investigation of mGluR function.</p>For use in therapy or treatment, an effective amount of the compound of formula I, a prodrug thereof, or a pharmaceutical preparation thereof (e.g., a formulation that facilitates passage through the blood brain barrier or that slows down in vivo metabolism) can be administered to a subject in accordance with any method that allows the compound to be taken up by the appropriate organ and perform its intended function. Preferred routes of administration include oral, intravenous and transdermal (e.g., via a patch) administration.</p>In addition to the above-described therapeutic uses, the compounds of the invention may be labeled (e.g., radioactively using <sup>3</sup>H, <sup>11</sup>C, <sup>14</sup>C or <sup>13</sup>N, or non-radioactively using <sup>2</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>15</sup>N or <sup>18</sup>O) and used in research, for example, for studies on receptor function or to elucidate the structure, function or mechanisms of competitive ligand interactions. In addition, labeled compounds can be useful for determining the selectivity, specificity, or potency of novel clinical entities directed at the glutamate receptor. Further, the compounds can be useful for testing competing compounds for the ability to interact with a member of the glutamate receptor family (i.e., in a competitive binding assay).</p>Generally, compounds of the invention are metabotropic glutamate receptor ligands, i.e., are capable of binding to metabotropic glutamate receptors. As a result, they may demonstrate agonist, antagonist, or partial agonist activity at these receptors. The use of expression cloning techniques has led to the identification of eight mGluR subtypes, which have been placed into three major categories based on their molecular structure, signal transduction mechanisms, and pharmacological properties. Compounds demonstrating agonist, antagonist, or partial agonist activity at Group I, II, or III receptors are useful as described herein, as pharmacological tools or as therapeutic agents. Compounds demonstrating selectivity for one or more receptor sub-types are similarly useful. For therapeutic uses, compounds demonstrating antagonist activity at Group I receptors, or compounds demonstrating agonist or partial agonist activity at Group II or Group III receptors may be preferred.</p>The invention will now be illustrated by the following non-limiting Examples.</p>EXAMPLE 1As illustrated in Scheme 1, oxazolidine 1 was produced using a procedure similar to that described in Helv. Chim. Acta. 1987, 70, 1194. Treatment of 1 with HCl in methanol afforded \u03b1-allylserine methyl ester which was protected with benzyl chloroformate to give compound 2. The alcohol was oxidized under Swern conditions and the resulting aldehyde treated with methyl (triphenylphosphoranylidene)acetat"
