    "r oligosaccharide derivatives as shown in Formulas IV and V. Biantennary oligosaccharides, in general, have two terminal M6P residues, and may, in some embodiments, further comprise one or more penultimate M6P residues. Linear oligosaccharides have at least one M6P residue, and may comprise a terminal M6P residue. In general, the terminal M6P residues may be connected by an \u03b11,2 linkage. (See Distler et al., J. Biol. Chem. 266:21687-21692 (1991), observing that an \u03b11,2 linkage at the terminal M6P resulted in greater binding to CI-MPR and the cation-dependent MPR (CD-MPR) than either \u03b11,3 or \u03b11,6 linkages.) In some embodiments the terminal M6P residues are connected, at their respective reducing ends, to the adjacent residue by an \u03b11,2 linkage. In some embodiments, two terminal M6P residues are greater than 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, or 40 \u212b apart, as determined by, e.g., X-ray crystallography, NMR, and/or molecular modeling. For example, molecular modeling may be performed as described in Balaji et al., Glycobiology 4:497-515 (1994). In some embodiments, the oligosaccharide is chosen such that the terminal M6P residues have relatively little steric hindrance. In some embodiments, oligosaccharides in which the terminal M6P residues are relatively unhindered bind to CI-MPR with greater affinity than oligosaccharides in which the terminal M6P residues are hindered.</p>In general, the oligosaccharide will bind to CI-MPR. For example, the oligosaccharide may bind to CI-MPR with a dissociation constant less than, e.g., 500, 100, 50, 10, 5, 1, or 0.1 nM, or less than, e.g., 100, 50, 10, 5, 2, or 1 \u03bcM. The crystal structure of the N-terminal domains 1-3 of CI-MPR is known, in both ligand-bound and unbound forms. Olson et al., J. Biol. Chem. 279:34000-34009 (2004); Olson et al., EMBO J. 23:2019-2028 (2004). Further, the structurally related CD-MPR is also known in both ligand-bound and unbound forms. Olson et al., J. Biol. Chem. 274:29889-29886 (1999); Olson et al. J. Biol. Chem. 277:10156-10161 (2002). Accordingly, the skilled artisan would be able to use that receptor structural information to select an appropriate oligosaccharide.</p>The oligosaccharide may be chosen, for example, from any of the oligosaccharides of Formulae I, II, III, IV, V, or VI, as depicted above, including Oligosaccharides 1-127 described below. The oligosaccharides of Formulae I-III are formally derived from Formula B by removal of a branch, removal and/or substitution of a monosaccharide residue, and/or modification of the linkage (e.g., \u03b11,2; \u03b11,3; \u03b11,4; or \u03b11,6) between adjacent monosaccharide residues. In certain embodiments, the oligosaccharide may have, e.g., 1, 2, or 3 additional mannose residues in one or both arms, connected via an \u03b11,2; \u03b11,3; or \u03b11,6 linkage, relative to any of Formulae I-VI.</p>The oligosaccharide may have, e.g., one, two or three M6P residues. The oligosaccharide may have, e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 monosaccharide residues in all. In othe",
    "ear SAM4, \u03b1SAM6, and \u03b2SAM6 are shown in FIG. 13. In addition, specific activity of conjugates prepared using the SAM method vs. the GAM method were evaluated. There was an inverse correlation (p&lt;0.001) between the number of M6P per GAA and the specific activity of the NeoGAA conjugates prepared at small and large scale, and 16.6-fold molar excess of oligosaccharide/GAA. Loss of GAA activity was also observed with increasing amounts of M6P content on SAM or GAM conjugates in separate experiments in which NeoGAA concentrations were titrated during conjugation (from 2.5 to 33-fold molar excess of oligosaccharide). For SAM with 49-81% GAA activity (compared to control), the various NeoGAAs contained 6-8 molecules of oligosaccharide per protein. GAM conjugates had 67-92% activity, and 4-6 oligosaccharides per protein.</p>B. M6P Receptor Binding:</p>The functional effects of conjugation were evaluated by monitoring the binding of NeoGAA to the soluble cation independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (sCIMPR) by Biacore and M6P receptor column affinity HPLC, and by uptake in L6 myoblast cells. sCIMPR, as purified from bovine serum, contains extracellular domains A-X, while lacking the transmembrane portion.</p>For Biacore analysis, sCIMPR was amine-coupled to a CM-5 chip, 10 \u03bcg/mL of NeoGAA sample was loaded onto the surface and eluted with increasing concentrations of mannose-6-phosphate. Affinity was quantified as the concentration of M6P needed to displace 50% of NeoGAA bound (EC50). The method was used to monitor the effects of conjugation and oxidation on receptor affinity.</p>FIG. 14 shows results of the Biacore analysis. Injection of 10 \u03bcg/mL NeoGAA onto a sCIMPR-immobilized Biacore chip led to a response increase of \u02dc250 RU, while the same amount of rhGAA caused \u02dc100 RU deflection. In addition, approximately 10-fold greater M6P concentration was required to elute NeoGAA than rhGAA (EC50 values of approximately 0.1 vs. 1.0 mM for rhGAA and NeoGAA, respectively). There was a linear relationship (r-squared&gt;0.95) between the EC50 values and the level of conjugation for NeoGAA prepared using 2 and 7.5 mM periodate. Across the ranges of conjugation examined (1.6-4.7 moles glycan/mole NeoGAA for 2 mM periodate preparation, and 1.0-8.5 moles glycan/mole for the 7.5 mM NalO<sub>4 </sub>preparation), the effect of conjugation level on binding affinities were similar for NeoGAA prepared with 2 and 7.5 mM periodate.</p>M6P receptor binding was evaluated by HPLC using a M6P receptor column prepared by immobilizing sCIMPR on a Poros EP resin, which is then packed into an analytical HPLC column. rhGAA and NeoGAA were eluted using 0.25, 0.85, 5, and 20 mM M6P (FIG. 15 A and B). In one experiment, SAM2 and GAM2 were compared to \u03b2SAM6 and GAM6 (FIG. 15C). SAM6 and GAM6 required 20 mM M6P before the majority of the material is eluted (&gt;95% of the conjugate bound to the column). SAM2 and GAM2 bound less tightly, with the majority eluting at 5 mM M6P (&gt;95% bound to the column).</p>In addition, NeoGAA conjugates SAM2, SAM3, SAM4, Linear SAM4, and \u03b1SAM6 were evaluated for M6P receptor binding (FIG. 15 D). The majority of SAM2, SAM3, and both SAM4 conjugates eluted with 5 mM M6P, while both SAM6 conjugates required 20 mM MOP.</p>NeoGAA conjugates with varying amounts of conjugation were evaluated (FIG. 15E). The percentage of NeoGAA in the bound fraction was consistently &gt;95% for those preparations with &gt;2.0 moles glycan per mole NeoGAA conjugated. In the few fractions which had lower conjugation levels "
