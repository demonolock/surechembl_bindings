For each candidate lead, new ASOs with identical sequences, were synthesized with 1 to 3 phosphodiester (PO) backbone modifications each in the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032, 2\u2032-MOE RNA-like wings, with total of 4-5 PO modifications (i.e., a PS linkage replaced with a PO linkage) per ASO. These modifications replace the corresponding PS linkages in the original lead ASOs. The PO-modified ASOs are referred to in FIG. 10 as daughter ASOs.</p>These candidate leads were then tested for dose-response modulation of UBE3A transcript expression. For these experiments either primary fibroblasts, plated 10 k per well of a 96-well plate, or mouse embryonic fibroblasts plated at 15 k per well, were plated onto a 96-well plate. ASOs were screened at 6 doses: 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 nM. ASOs were delivered by transfection using RNAi Max at 0.5 uL per well of a 96-well plate.</p>FIG. 10 displays example data of UBE3A ASO dose-response modulation of target expression for 2 lead candidate examples and their PO-modified daughter molecules in Dup15q patient fibroblasts (top) or mouse embryonic fibroblasts (bottom). All samples were normalized to vehicle conditions.</p>FIG. 11 plots the dose-response and indicates EC50 for the same 2 example lead candidates from FIG. 10. All cells were transfected with ASOs 48-hours after plating. Cells were harvested for qPCR an additional 48 hours after ASO transfection. Actin was used as the normalizing gene for UBE3A. Each data point represents 2 technical replicates and from 1 biological replicate.</p>Example 4\u2014Dose-Response Screening of UBE3A Lead ASO CandidatesCandidate lead UBE3A-targeting ASOs were selected based on greater than 80-85% transcript knockdown in the primary single-dose screening from Examples 1 and 2. For each candidate lead, new ASOs with identical sequences, were synthesized with 1 to 3 PO backbone modifications each in the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032, 2\u2032-MOE RNA-like wings (total of 4-5 PO modifications per ASO), as described in Example 3. All candidate leads were then tested for dose-response modulation of UBE3A transcript expression.</p>For these experiments either primary fibroblasts, plated 10 k per well of a 96-well plate, or mouse embryonic fibroblasts plated at 15 k per well, were plated onto a 96-well plate. ASOs were screened at 6 doses: 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 nM, unless otherwise indicated. ASOs were delivered by transfection using RNAi Max at 0.5 uL per well of a 96-well plate.</p>All samples were normalized to either vehicle or control conditions within each experiment.
