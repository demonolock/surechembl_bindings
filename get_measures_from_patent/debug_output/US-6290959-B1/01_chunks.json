    "ashings in PBS, the nitrocellulose was air-dried and autoradiographed.</p>Enzymatic Deglycosylation</p>Purified asymmetric unit membranes were dissolved in 0.1% SDS at room temperature. The solution was adjusted to a final concentration of 1% octyl glucoside, 0.05% NaN<sub>3</sub>, 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5), and 33 milliunits/ml endoglycosidase(endo)H. Another fraction was made to contain 40 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and 14 units/ml N-glycosidase F (Boehringer Mannheim). After the mixtures were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 16 hours, the proteins were resolved by SDS/PAGE and either stained by silver nitrate or blotted onto nitrocellulose for the bacterial overlay assay.</p>Type 1-Fimbriated E. coli Bind to Isolated Urothelial Plaques</p>To determine whether the asymmetric unit membrane proteins can serve as E. coli receptors, the binding of five strains of <sup>35</sup>[S]methionine-labelled, type 1- and P-fimbriated E. coli to highly purified bovine asymmetric unit membranes was tested using an in vitro adherence assay. Bovine urothelial plaques were isolated by discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation plus detergent wash, taking advantage of the remarkable insolubility of asymmetric unit membranes in many detergents, including 2% Sarkosyl (Wu, 1992; 1994). After negative staining, these highly purified plaques exhibit two-dimensional crystalline arrays of 16-nm protein particles and give rise to four major uroplakin bands by SDS/PAGE. In the binding assay, purified asymmetric unit membranes were used to coat the wells of a microtiter plate and incubated with <sup>35</sup>S-labelled E. coli, and the radioactivities of the bound bacteria, dissolved in 1% SDS, were quantitated. Of the bacterial strains expressing both type 1 and P (strain J96), type I only (SH48), P only (HU849 and IA2), or neither (P678-54 as a control), only the first two type 1-fimbriated E. coli were able to bind the asymmetric unit membranes, as shown in FIG. 1A. Although J96 expresses both type 1 and P fimbriae (of the G-1 and G-3 types), its binding to asymmetrical unit membranes could be completely blocked by mannose, suggesting that the type 1, but not the P, fimbrial adhesin was responsible for the observed binding, as can be seen from FIG. 1B.</p>FIG. 1A shows the in vitro binding of various E. coli strains to bovine urothelial plaques. Purified bovine urothelial plaques, consisting of asymmetric unit membranes that cover 70-80% of the urothelial apical surface, were immobilized on microtiter wells (0.2 microgram per well). The unoccupied binding sites were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS. BSA was used to coat the control wells. The E. coli strains used were J96, which express type 1 fimbriae as well as P fimbriae carrying the G-1 and G-2 adhesins; SH48, which expresses type 1 fimbriae only; HU849, which expresses P fimbriae carrying G-1 adhesin; IA2, which expresses P fimbriae carrying G-adhesins; and nonfimbriated P678-54.</p><sup>35</sup>[S",
