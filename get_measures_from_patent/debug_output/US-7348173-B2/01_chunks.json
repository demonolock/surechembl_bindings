    " 2 Hg Column (FIG. 3). The above eluent from the DEAE exchange, is mixed with p-chloromercuric benzoic acid resin (Commercially available from BioRad chemical company) for 1 hour at 4\u00b0 C. The fraction which is bound to the above mercury resin, displays the lipid amidase activity (none in flow through), is washed with 5 column volumes of BI with 0.2% Triton, 5 column volumes of BI with 0.2% Triton and 150 mM NaCl, and eluted with 1.5 column volumes BI with 0.2% Triton, 150 mM NaCl, and 25 mM b-mercaptoethanol.</p>Step 3 Heparin Column (FIG. 3). Hg-eluted amidase activity was passed over Heparin column (BioRad) and washed with 10 column volumes of BI with 0.7% CHAPS and 150 mM NaCl (detergent exchange). Elution was conducted with 1 column volume each of BI with 0.7% CHAPS and 300 mM, 400 mM, 500 mM, 650 mM, and 750 mM NaCl, respectively, with amidase activity eluting in the final two fractions.</p>Step 4 Affinity Column (FIGS. 3 and 4). Heparin-eluted amidase activity was mixed with Triton X-100 for a final concentration of 0.2%, and then passed over CF<sub>3</sub>-inhibitor linked to activated pyridyl disulphide beads (103: attachment of inhibitor to beads is described infra) and washed with 20 column volumes of BI with 0.2% Triton X-100. Elution was conducted by passing 3 column volumes of BI with 0.2% Triton and 20 mM DTT, and letting column stand at 4\u00b0 C. for 30 h. Then, washing column with 1.5 column volumes of BI with 0.2% Triton and 20 mM DTT eluted single protein of 60 kD in size.</p>Eluted 60 kd protein was digested with trypsin and peptides were sequenced as described infra.</p>The purity of the activity is then assessed after this procedure according to an assay protocol.</p>5. Assay for Fatty-Acid Amide Hydrolase Activity:</p>The following thin layer chromatography (TLC) protocol is used for assaying cis-9,10 octadecenoamide hydrolysis activity, also referred to as fatty-acid amide hydrolase activity. Oleamide is first labeled with <sup>14</sup>C. To accomplish this, <sup>14</sup>C-Oleic acid (1-10 \u03bcM, Moravek Biochemicals, 5-50 \u03bcCi/\u03bcM) in CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2 </sub>(200 \u03bcL, 0.005-0.05 M) at 0\u00b0 C. was treated with excess oxalyl chloride and the reaction mixture was warmed to 25\u00b0 C. for 6 hours. The reaction mixture was then concentrated under a constant stream of gaseous nitrogen and the remaining residue was cooled to 0\u00b0 C. and treated with excess saturated aqueous ammonium hydroxide. After 5 minutes, the reaction mixture was partitioned between Et)Ac (1.5 mL) and 10% HCl (1.0 mL). The organic layer was then washed with water (1.0 mL) and concentrated under a constant stream of gaseous nitrogen to provide <sup>14</sup>C-oleamide in quantitative yield as judged by TLC (60% EtOAc in hexanes; oleamide R<sub>f</sub>-0.2; oleic acid R<sub>f</sub>-0.8)</p>Approximately 1 \u03bcCi of <sup>14</sup>C-oleamide (specific activity 5-50 \u03bcCi/\u03bcM) in ethanol was incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 1-2 hours with 70 \u03bcL of 126 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0 (final concentration of ethanol was 2.0%).
