The toxic payload may also comprise or consist of existing antifungal agents such as echinocandins, polyenes, azoles or their structural analogues, antifungal peptides, antifungal exotoxins and other cell killing agents.</p>Also provided herein are compositions comprising an antibody as desc",
    "formans. \n\nAs described herein, the antibodies of the invention can detect both morphology specific and morphology-independent epitopes with high specificity. The antibodies described herein may thus bind to e.g. C. albicans with high affinity, as determined by dissociation or association constant, relative to other fungal targets. For example, an antibody of the invention may display a binding affinity for C. albicans with a K<sub>D</sub> of at least 1000 fold or at least 2000 fold lower than a non-Cancf/c/a pathogenic fungus such as Aspergillus fumigatus and Cryptococcus neoformans and Pneumocystis jirovecii. As used herein, the term \"binding\" in the context of the binding of an antibody to a predetermined antigen typically is a binding with an affinity corresponding to a K<sub>D</sub> of about 10<sup>-7</sup> M or less, such as about 10<sup>-8</sup> M or less, such as about 10<sup>9</sup> M or less, about 10<sup>10</sup> M or less, or about 10<sup>11</sup> M or even less when determined by for instance surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology in a BIAcore 3000 instrument using the antigen as the ligand and the antibody as the analyte. </p>Nevertheless an antibody as described herein may bind to the species closely related to C. albicans e.g. C. dubliniensis, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis (clonal complex), C. krusei, C. auris (clonal complex), C. glabrata and C. lusitaniae e.g. for example with an affinity within a 1000-fold of the binding to C. albicans (assessed using EC50). </p>Further, in some embodiments, the antibodies of the invention may display cross-reactivity between different species, e.g. between C. albicans and S. cerevisiae, A. fumigatus. In some embodiments, the antibodies of the invention may bind to Candida and Aspergillus CWPs. </p>The term \u201cselective\u201d as used herein may refer to an antibody binding a target antigen, epitope or species with a K<sub>D</sub> about 1000-, 500-, 200-, 100-, 50-, 10-, or about 5-fold lower than the antibody binding a non-target antigen, epitope or species as measured by e.g. SPR at 25\u00b0 C. </p>Preferred CWPs for use in the invention </p>Pga31 </p>Pga31 is a novel protein with unknown function which has no homologues in S. cerevisiae. Studies have suggested that Pga31 may be involved in the maintenance of cell wall integrity and cell wall organization by regulating the assembly of chitin (Pitarch, 2008). Plaine et a!., (2008) showed that deletion of pga31 in C. albicans led to significantly reduced chitin levels in the cell wall and caspofungin hypersensitivity, suggesting a role for Pga31 in the cell wall salvage mechanism. This protein is 293 amino acids long and has a molecular mass of 29.735 kDa. There are two main glycosylation sites at positions 131 and 190. Furthermore, there is a lipidation at position 271 , which suggests linkage to GPI-anchor at that position (Information is based on BLAST and UniProt search). </p>Pga31 of C. albicans has been detected in the cell wall by performing pro"
