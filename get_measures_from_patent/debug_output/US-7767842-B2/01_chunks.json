    "zyme in the mevalonate pathway, the inhibition of which causes the accumulation and release of upstream isoprenoid lipids such as IPP. Aminobisphosphonate compounds had been used in human therapy for the treatment of bone metastases in cancer patients, and provided a first set of evidence for in vivo expansion of human V\u03b39/V\u03b42<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes induced by phosphoantigen agonists, reporting increases of circulating 75 T cells within one to three weeks in human adults with multiple myeloma after therapeutic intravenous injection of 60-90 mg of pamidronate (Kunzmann et al, 1999). However, such compounds require presentation by antigen presenting cells and cannot produce substantial stimulation of V\u03b39/V\u03b42 T cell activity as assessed by cytokine secretion in a pure V\u03b39/V\u03b42 T cell culture. Moreover, pamidronate shows very low potency of activation of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, reported to achieve at best only 2-fold increase in \u03b3\u03b4 T cell count (Wilhelm et al., 2003).</p>Recently, several highly potent \u03b3\u03b4 T cell activating pyrophosphate-containing compounds have been described which directly activate \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. In particular, phosphalohydrin and phosphoepoxyde compounds were described by the group of J. J. Fournie. (R,S)-3-(bromomethyl)-3-butanol-1-yl-diphosphate, also referred to as BrHPP (BromoHydrin PyroPhosphate) is currently used in ongoing human clinical studies to stimulate the proliferation of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells ex vivo. Other pyrophosphate containing compounds with high specific activity (EC50 in the nanomolar or better range) are produced through an isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway called the \u201cRohmer\u201d or \u201cnon-mevalonate\u201d pathway, which is specific to pro- and eukaryotic microorganisms (Feurle et al., 2002; Jomaa et al (2003); Jomaa et al., 1999a; Jomaa et al., 1999b; Rohmer et al., 1993).</p>Despite the foregoing, there is still a need of new compounds providing \u03b3\u03b4 T cell activation, in particular compounds having increased potency and/or preferred pharmacodynamic properties. Such compounds have particular advantages in non-life threatening or chronic therapeutic indications where therapies should be free of toxicity.</p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention now discloses a new class of compounds having \u03b3\u03b4 T cell activating properties. This new class of compounds comprises phosphoramidate esters. The inventors have found that the class of compounds described herein have increased potency over other compounds that modulate \u03b3\u03b4 T cell activity previously tested by the inventors. In addition, the compounds can achieve a greater \u03b3\u03b4 T cell activating effect at their EC100 (the efficient concentration of the composition which produces its maximum response or effect with respect to such activity of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells) that other compounds.</p>These compounds can be used to efficiently regulate the activity of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, particularly the activation and proliferation of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, preferably V\u03b39/V\u03b42 T cells, in vivo in a subject. These new \u03b3\u03b4 T cell activators can be ",

The compound of the invention demonstrates not only 3-4 fold increased potency over the next most potent compounds, but also increased absolute activation of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells as observed by TNF\u03b1 release.</p>DETAILED DESCRIPTIONDefinitions</p>Within the context of the present invention, the expression \u201cregulating the activity of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells\u201d designates causing or favoring an increase in the number and/or biological activity of such cells in a subject. Regulating thus includes without limitation modulating (e.g., stimulating) expansion of such cells in a subject and/or, for instance, triggering of cytokine secretion (e.g., TNF\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3). As indicated, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells normally represent between about 1-10% of total circulating lymphocytes in a healthy adult human subject. The present invention can be used to significantly increase the \u03b3\u03b4 T cells population in a subject, particularly to reach at least 10%, 12%, 15%, 20%, or 30-90% of total circulating lymphocytes, typically 40-90%, more preferably from 50-90%. In typical embodiments, the invention allows the selective expansion of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in a subject, to reach 60-90% of total circulating lymphocytes, preferably 70-90%, more preferably from 80-90%. Regulating also includes, in addition or in the alternative, modulating the biological activity of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in a subject, particularly their cytolytic activity or their cytokine-secretion activity.

For example, \u201cbetween 1 and 3\u201d stands for a range \u201cfrom and including 1 up to and including 3\u201d, and \u201cin the range from 1 to 3\u201d would stand for \u201cfrom and including 1 up to and including 3\u201d. The same is true where instead of numbers (e.g. 3) words denoting numbers are used (e.g. \u201cthree\u201d).</p>Where \u201cabout\u201d is used in connection with a number, this preferably means the number +/\u22121-15%, more preferably the number plus 5%, most preferably the number itself without \u201cabout\u201d. For example, \u201cabout 100\u201d would stand for \u201cfrom and including 85 to and including 115\u201d. Where \u201cabout\u201d is used in connection with numeric ranges, for example \u201cabout 1 to about 3\u201d, or \u201cbetween about one and about three\u201d, preferably the definition of \u201cabout\u201d given for a number in the last sentence is applied to each number defining the start and the end of a range separately. Preferably, where \u201cabout\u201d is used in connection with any numerical values, the \u201cabout\u201d can be deleted.</p>\u201cWeekly\u201d stands for \u201cabout once a week\u201d (meaning that more than one treatment is made with an interval of about one week between treatments), the about here preferably meaning +/\u22121 day (that is, translating into \u201cevery 6 to 8 days\u201d); most preferably, \u201cweekly\u201d stands for \u201conce every 7 days\u201d.</p>As used herein, the term \u201cEC50\u201d with respect to regulating the activity of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, refers to the efficient concentration of the subject compositions which produces 50% of its maximum response or effect with respect to such activity of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells.</p>As used herein, the term \u201cEC100\u201d with respect to regulating the activity of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, refers to the efficient concentration of the subject compositions which produces its maximum response or effect with respect to such activity of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells.</p>New Class of \u03b3\u03b4 T Lymphocyte Activators: Phosphoramidate Esters</p>The new class of compounds described by the present inventors comprises phosphoramidate esters. The inventors have found that the compounds of this class show increased in potency over other compounds that modulate \u03b3\u03b4 T cell activity previously tested by the inventors. In addition, the compounds of the invention can achieve greater \u03b3\u03b4 T cell activating effect at their EC100 (the efficient concentration of the composition which produces its maximum response or effect with respect to such activity of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells) than other compounds. While not wishing to be held by theory, the present inventors propose that the presence of an NH group may result in modified binding\u2014generally increased strength of binding\u2014to the compound's target, probably due to H-binding considerations compared for example to pyrophosphate ester compounds. This modification in H binding considerations can provide distinct pharmacological properties, for example target binding a"
