The strength, or affinity of immunological binding interactions can be expressed in terms of the equilibrium binding constant (K<sub>d</sub>) of the interaction, wherein a smaller K<sub>d </sub>represents a greater affinity. Immunological binding properties of selected polypeptides can be quantified using methods well known in the art. One such method entails measuring the rates of antigen-binding site/antigen complex formation and dissociation, wherein those rates depend on the concentrations of the complex partners, the affinity of the interaction, and geometric parameters that equally influence the rate in both directions. Thus, both the \u201con rate constant\u201d (K<sub>on</sub>) and the \u201coff rate constant\u201d (K<sub>off</sub>) can be determined by calculation of the concentrations and the actual rates of association and dissociation. (See Nature 361: 186-87 (1993)). The ratio of K<sub>off</sub>/K<sub>on </sub>enables the cancellation of all parameters not related to affinity, and is equal to the equilibrium binding constant, K<sub>D</sub>. (See, generally, Davies et al. (1990) Annual Rev Biochem 59:439-473). An antibody of the present invention can specifically bind to a PD-1 epitope when the equilibrium binding constant (K<sub>D</sub>) is \u22641 \u03bcM, \u226410 \u03bcM, \u226410 nM, \u226410 pM, or &lt;100 pM to about 1 pM, as measured by kinetic assays such as radioligand binding assays or similar assays known to those skilled in the art, such as BIAcore or Octet (BLI). For example, in some embodiments, the K<sub>D </sub>is between about 1E-12 M and a K<sub>D </sub>about 1E-11 M. In some embodiments, the K<sub>D </sub>is between about 1E-11 M and a K<sub>D </sub>about 1E-10 M. In some embodiments, the K<sub>D </sub>is between about 1E-10 M and a K<sub>D </sub>about 1E-9 M. In some embodiments, the K<sub>D </sub>is between about 1E-9 M and a K<sub>D </sub>about 1E-8 M. In some embodiments, the K<sub>D </sub>is between about 1E-8 M and a K<sub>D </sub>about 1E-7 M. In some embodiments, the K<sub>D </sub>is between about 1E-7 M and a K<sub>D </sub>about 1E-6 M. For example, in some embodiments, the K<sub>D </sub>is about 1E-12 M while in other embodiments the K<sub>D </sub>is about 1E-11 M. In some embodiments, the K<sub>D </sub>is about 1E-10 M while in other embodiments the K<sub>D </sub>is about 1E-9 M. In some embodiments, the K<sub>D </sub>is about 1E-8 M while in other embodiments the K<sub>D </sub>is about 1E-7 M. In some embodiments, the K<sub>D </sub>is about 1E-6 M while in other embodiments the K<sub>D </sub>is about 1E-5 M. In some embodiments, for example, the K<sub>D </sub>is about 3 E-11 M, while in other embodiments the K<sub>D </sub>is about 3E-12 M. In some embodiments, the K<sub>D </s",
    "tains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, immortalized cells. For example, if the parental cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (\u201cHAT medium\u201d), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.</p><p id=\"p-0121\" num=\"0130\">Immortalized cell lines that are useful are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level expression of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. For example, immortalized cell lines can be murine myeloma lines, which can be obtained, for instance, from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center (San Diego, Calif.) and the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, Va.). Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies. (See Kozbor, J. Immunol, 133:3001 (1984); Brodeur et al, Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, (1987) pp. 51-63)).</p><p id=\"p-0122\" num=\"0131\">The culture medium in which the hybridoma cells are cultured can then be assayed for the presence of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. For example, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by the hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). Such techniques and assays are known in the art. The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson and Pollard, Anal. Biochem., 107:220 (1980). Moreover, in therapeutic applications of monoclonal antibodies, it is important to identify antibodies having a high degree of specificity and a high binding affinity for the target antigen.</p><p id=\"p-0123\" num=\"0132\">After the desired hybridoma cells are identified, the clones can be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods. (See Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, Academic Press, (1986) pp. 59-103). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium and RPMI-1640 medium. Alternatively, the hybridoma cells can be grown in vivo as ascites in a mammal.</p><p id=\"p-0124\" num=\"0133\">The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones can be isolated or purified from the culture medium or ascites fluid by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography.</p><p id=\"p-0125\" num=\"0134\">Monoclonal antibodies can also be made by recombinant DNA methods, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567 (incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). D",
    "ibraries to create #42-light chain shuffling (LCS) library and #52 LCS library, respectively. Each library then panned against PD-L1-mouse Fc soluble antigen for 4 rounds with decreased antigen concentration (3 rounds at lug/ml PD-L1-mFc, 4th round was 0.5 and 0.1 ug/ml respectively; 1 ml to coat the tube). Single colonies were screened against soluble PD-L1-mFc with ELISA. Positive clones were enriched after the 2nd round of panning and the affinity increased. Eluted phage after 3rd round panning will also be cloned into yeast display library to screen for high affinity binders via flow cytometry, if necessary. The anti-PD-L1 #42 &amp; #50 previously discovered from Dr. Marasco's lab have lower affinities to PD-L1 when compared with bench mark commercial antibodies. Knowing that the heavy chains of #42 and #50 contributing mainly to the PD-L1 binding specificity, new single chain Fv phage display libraries were created using the light chain shuffling technique where either #42 or #50 heavy chain variable regions were fused with random kappa and lambda light chain variable regions, resulting #42 LCS and #50 LCS libraries are each with \u02dc2\u00d710E8 diversity. Panning the new #42 and #52 LCS libraries with decreased antigen concentration lead to discovery of high affinity anti-PD-L1 antibodies containing the original #42 or #50 heavy chain and novel light chain sequences. Other antibodies were discovered via panning with a naive phage library.</p><heading id=\"h-0028\">Example 2\u2014Dual Binding Assay</heading><p id=\"p-0320\" num=\"0315\">For each well in a 96 well plate, 2E5 CHO-GITR cells were washed with MACS buffer and resuspended in 100 ul MACS buffer. Three fold serial dilutions of bispecific GITR-PDL1 Lc fusion were made in a separate 96 well plate with a starting concentration of 9 ug/ml. Added 50 ul of Ab dilution to 100 ul of buffer with cells, resulting in a final starting concentration of 3 ug/ml. Ab dilutions were as follows: 3, 1, 0.33, 0.111, 0.037, 0.012, 0.004, 0.0014. Cells were incubated with Ab for 30 minute at 4\u00b0 C., spun down and washed 2\u00d7 with 250 ul MACS buffer. After final wash, cells were resuspended in MACS buffer with 10 ug/m1 PD-L1-rbFc fusion (extracellular domain of PD-L1) and incubated 4\u00b0 C. for 30 min. Cells were washed 2\u00d7 with 250 ul MACS buffer and resuspended in 100 ul MACS buffer with FITC Donkey anti-Rabbit IgG (minimal x-reactivity) antibody (BioLegend cat #406403) at 2 ug/ml. Cells were incubated at 4\u00b0 C. for 20 minutes. Cells were washed 2\u00d7 with 250 ul MACS buffer and resuspended in 200 ul MACS buffer. The plate was then read on a Fortessa HTS FACS plate reader.</p><p id=\"p-0321\" num=\"0316\">The GITR LC fusion antibodies are able to bind both GITR (membrane bound) and PD-Ll (soluble protein) simultaneously (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).
