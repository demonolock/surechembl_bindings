    "is invention. Another factor in selecting a radionuclide for in vivo diagnosis is that its half-life be long enough so that the label is still detectable at the time of maximum uptake by the target tissue, but short enough so that deleterious irradiation of the host is minimized. In one preferred embodiment, a radionuclide used for in vivo imaging does not emit particles, but produces a large number of photons in a 140-200 keV range, which may be readily detected by conventional gamma cameras.</p>In vivo imaging may be used to detect occult metastases which are not observable by other methods. Imaging could be used, for example, to stage tumors non-invasively.</p>Use of Antibodies to Detect uPA- or uPAR-Complexes by Immunoassay</p>Antibodies of this invention are useful in immunoassays to detect molecules containing these epitopes in tissue sample or a body fluid, such as serum or plasma. Such Abs would detect the antigen or an epitope-bearing fragment thereof. Thus, if proteolysis in the tumor milieu results in release of the fragments or in tissue.</p>Any conventional immunoassay known in the art may be employed for this purpose, though Enzyme Immunoassays such as ELISA are preferred. Immunoassay methods are also described in references cited above.</p>Competitive immunoassays are typically used to detect molecules in a test sample that are ligands for the complex that may mimic the mAbs in their binding specificity, affinity, capacity, etc. In one embodiment a competitive binding assay, the amount of Ab bound to the complex is measured (directly or indirectly using a labeled anti-Ig). Competition (i.e., less binding of Ab to complex) in the presence of the test sample is evidence that one or more components of the sample bind to the complex. It is expected that most compounds being tested will bind with moderate affinities (approximately 1-10 \u03bcM)</p>In another embodiment, a solid support, e.g., a microplate, is coated with the mAb of interest. The test sample is added and incubated, e.g., for about 30 minutes to allow binding of relevant molecules to the Ab. The plates are washed and the complex, in detectably labeled form (e.g., biotinylated), is added as the competitive ligand, and allowed to compete with the test sample for binding to the Ab. A \u201cpositive\u201d result for the test sample will be expressed as less binding of labeled complex bound to the solid phase. This approach, in which the complex solution and sample solution are not added simultaneously, avoids the confounding effects of test sample binding directly to the complex, because any test sample present must first be captured by the immobilized mAb. Preferably, to assure that binding is specific, a series of dilutions are run to obtain a dilution curve. This will show if, for example, there is 50% less binding/signal ratio with half the sample. In the absence of such dilution effects, it may be concluded that multiple binding entities are entering into the assay. Results are more ri",
    "eled Ab and the immobilized label is measured. This type of forward sandwich assay may be a simple \u201cyes/no\u201d assay to determine whether antigen is present or may be made quantitative by comparing the amount of immobilized labeled Ab with the amount immobilized when a standard sample containing a known quantity of antigen is used.</p>So called \u201csimultaneous\u201d and \u201creverse\u201d sandwich assays may also be used. A simultaneous assay involves a single incubation step as the immobilized Ab and labeled Ab are added simultaneously to the sample. After appropriate incubation, the solid support is washed to remove residue of the sample and uncomplexed labeled Ab. The presence or amount of labeled Ab associated with the solid support is then determined as in the above conventional \u201cforward\u201d sandwich assay.</p>In a \u201creverse\u201d assay, a solution of labeled Ab is added to the sample after a suitable incubation period followed by addition of immobilized unlabeled Ab. After a second incubation, the solid phase material is washed in conventional fashion to free it of the residue of the sample and unreacted labeled Ab. The determination of immobilized Ab associated with the solid support is then determined as in the \u201csimultaneous\u201d and \u201cforward\u201d assays.</p>Assay for Antibody Binding to uPAR on Whole Cells</p>The uPAR-targeting Ab and/or conjugate thereof is readily tested for binding to uPAR, preferably by measuring inhibition of the binding of [<sup>125</sup>I]DFP-uPA to uPAR in a competitive ligand-binding assay or by directly labeling the Ab with [<sup>125</sup>I]. The assay may employ whole cells that express uPAR, for example cells lines such as A2780 or HeLa. A preferred assay is conducted as follows. Cells (about 5\u00d710<sup>4</sup>/well) are plated in medium (e.g., MEM with Earle's salts/10% FBS+antibiotics) in 24-well plates, then incubated in a humid 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere until the cells reach 70% confluence. Catalytically inactivated high molecular weight uPA (DFP-uPA) is radioiodinated using Iodo-gen\u00ae (Pierce) to a specific activity of about 250,000 cpm/\u03bcg. The cell-containing plates are then chilled on ice and the cells are washed twice (5 minutes each) with cold PBS/0.05% Tween-80. Test Abs and/or conjugates thereof are serially diluted in cold PBS/0.1% BSA/0.01% Tween-80 and added to each well to a final volume of 0.3 mL 10 minutes prior to the addition of the [<sup>125</sup>I]DFP-uPA. Each well then receives 9500 cpm of [<sup>125</sup>I]DFP-uPA at a final concentration of 0.2 nM). The plates are then incubated at 4\u00b0 C. for 2 hrs, after which time the cells are washed 3\u00d7 (5 minutes each) with cold PBS/0.05% Tween-80. NaOH (1N) is added to each well in 0.5 mL to lyse the cells, and the plate is incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature or until all the cells in each well are lysed as determined by microscopic examination. The contents of each well are then aspirated and the total counts in each well determined using a gamma counter. Each compound is te"
