    "nsists of up and down strokes of the lower surface in combination with a shearing (twisting) movement of the upper surface.Fig. 2 depicts RP-HPLC chromatograms of KSL standard in water (a) and incubated in 0.1 M borate buffer (pH 9) at 55\u00b0C for 3 days (b).Fig. 3 depicts the degradation kinetics of KSL in different pH conditions at 55\u00b0C.Fig. 4 depicts the Arrhenius plot for the degradation of KSL in different pH buffers.Fig. 5 depicts adsorption of KSL to HA discs in artificial saliva at 37\u00b0C wherein (a) is the adsorption profile of KSL (0.5 mg/ml) to 8 untreated HA discs and (b) is the adsorption of KSL to untreated and pretreated HA discs for 20 min. The pretreated HA discs were soaked in human saliva for 2 h at 37\u00b0C, and then washed with artificial saliva, dried and added to KSL solutions.Fig. 6 shows in vitro release of KSL from gum formulations in artificial saliva at 37\u00b0C. The chewing gums containing different KSL loadings (5, 10, 20 mg) were studied using a chewing apparatus.Fig. 7 shows in vivo release of KSL from gum formulations by a chew-out study. Volunteers chewed each gum containing 5, 10 or 20 mg of KSL for the predetermined times and the residual amount was extracted and analyzed by RP-HPLC.Fig. 8A is a schematic diagram of the dual flow cell model. (A) The flow system. Arrow heads indicate the direction of the flow. The system is connected by 14 gauge Masterflex tubing (Cole-Palmer, Vernon Hills, IL). For pulsed treatment of biofilms with KSL, a syringe pump (KD Scientific, Holliston, MA) with two injectable syringes containing respective treatment and control solutions is directly connected to each of the flow chambers through a three-way valve.Fig. 8B depicts a dual flow cell. The flow cell consists of two parallel flow chambers each of which contain three recesses for holding Ge disks. The inner diameter and depth of each recess is 10.25 mm and 2.0 mm, respectively. Holes with a diameter of 2.0 mm for flow inlets and outlets are drilled in each end of the flow chamber. The flow chambers are contained on one side by the polycarbonate bottom plate and on the other side by an aluminum cover plate containing two parallel 60 mm \u00d7 24 mm no. 2 cover glasses.Fig. 8C is a cross section of the flow chamber showing the dimensions of the flow channel (0.4 mm deep, 13 mm wide, and 25 mm long).Figs. 9A and B show the effect of KSL on oral biofilm development in a dual flow cell as revealed by DIC microscopy. (A) The continuous perfusion of a biofilm flow cell with KSL-containing (50 \u25a1g/ml medium prevents biofilm formation. Images of untreated biofilm cells (a-c, negative control) showing the development of biofilms from salivary bacteria adhered to saliva-conditioned Ge surfaces in the flow chamber perfused with KSL-free medium. Images of KSL (50 \u25a1g/ml) treated biofilm cells (d-f). Side by side images of treated versus untreated were obtained at intervals of 2 h (a, d), 5 h (b, e), and 8 h (c, f) following inoculation of the parallel chamber"
