By way of non-limiting example, a \"functional variant\" may be obtained by making one or more conservative substitutions in the parent. A functional variant in this application is a structure that binds to the SPIKE target of SARS-CoV-2 virus, which results from a modification of the amino acid sequence of human ACE 2.</p>The term \"analog\" refers to a structurally related polypeptide that has the function of the reference polypeptide molecule. In this application, refers to a polyamino acid structure that is related to the amino acid sequence structure of the ligand SARS-CoV-2 virus SPIKE and that has the function of targeting the binding of SARS-CoV-2 virus SPIKE to human ACE 2.</p>The term \"amino acid modification\" refers to a conservative amino acid modification that does not significantly affect or alter the binding characteristics of a CAR (e.g., extracellular recognition domain) of the pre",
    "ease progression, alleviation or palliation of the disease state, and remission or improved prognosis. By preventing the progression of a disease or disorder, treatment can prevent the exacerbation of a disorder in an affected or diagnosed subject or a subject suspected of having a disorder, and treatment can prevent the onset of a disorder or symptoms of a disorder in a subject at risk of, or suspected of having, the disorder.</p>The term \"disease\" as used herein refers to any condition or disorder that disrupts or interferes with the normal function of a cell, tissue or organ. Examples of diseases include neoplasia or pathogen infection of a cell.</p>The term \"exogenous nucleic acid molecule or polypeptide\" as used herein refers to a nucleic acid molecule (e.g., a cDNA, DNA, or RNA molecule) or polypeptide that is not normally present in a cell or in a sample obtained from a cell. The nucleic acid may be from another organism, or it may be, for example, an mRNA molecule that is not normally expressed in a cell or sample.</p>The present invention will be further described with reference to the following examples, but the present invention is not limited to these specific embodiments.
