Also see in this regard PCT International publication No. WO 99/37303 for its discussion of the use of a class of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor ligands, 1, 2 , 4-triazolo [4 , 3- b] pyridazines, in combination with SSRIs.</p>The present invention also pertains to methods of inhibiting the binding of benzodiazepine compounds, such as Rol5-1788, to the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors which methods involve contacting a compound of the invention with cells expressing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, wherein the compound is present at a concentration sufficient to inhibit benzodiazepine binding to GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in vi tro . This method includes inhibiting the binding of benzodiazepine compounds to GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in vivo, e.g., in a patient given an amount of a compound of Formula I that would be sufficient to inhibit the binding of benzodiazepine compounds to GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in vi tro. In one \n\nembodiment, such methods are useful in treating benzodiazepine drug overdose . The amount of a compound that would be sufficient to inhibit the binding of a benzodiazepine compound to the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor may be readily determined via an GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor binding assay, such as the assay described in Example 146. The GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors used to determine in vi tro binding may be obtained from a variety of sources, for example from preparations of rat cortex or from cells expressing cloned human GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. The present invention also pertains to methods for altering the signal-transducing activity, particularly the chloride ion conductance of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, said method comprising exposing cells expressing such receptors to an effective amount of a compound of the invention. This method includes altering the signal-transducing activity of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in vivo, e.g., in a patient given a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I that would be sufficient to alter the signal-transducing activity of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in vi tro . The amount of a compound that would be sufficient to alter the signal- transducing activity of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors may be determined via a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor signal transduction assay, such as the assay described in Example 147.</p>The GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor ligands provided by this invention and labeled derivatives thereof are also useful as standards and reagents in determining the ability of a potential pharmaceutical to bind to the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor.</p>Labeled derivatives the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor ligands provided by this invention are also useful as radiotracers for positron emission tomography (PE",

Tritium labeled probe compounds can also be prepared, when appropriate, by sodium borotritide reduction.

The high affinity and high selectivity of compounds of this invention for the benzodiazepine site of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor is confirmed using the binding assay described in Thomas and Tallman (J<sup>\"</sup>. Bio . Chem . 1981; 156:9838-9842, and J. Neurosci . 1983; 3:433-440). Rat cortical tissue is dissected and homogenized in 25 volumes (w/v) of Buffer A (0.05 M Tris HCl buffer, pH 7.4 at 4 \u00b0C) . The tissue homogenate is centrifuged in the cold (4 \u00b0C) at 20,000 x g for 20 minutes. The supernatant is decanted, the pellet rehomogenized in the same volume of buffer, and centrifuged again at 20,000 x g. The supernatant of this centrifugation step is decanted and the pellet is stored at -20 \u00b0C overnight. The pellet is then thawed and resuspended in 25 volumes of Buffer A (original wt/vol) , centrifuged at 20,000 x g and the supernatant decanted. This wash step is repeated once. The pellet is finally resuspended in 50 volumes of Buffer A.</p>Incubations containing 100 \u03bcl of tissue homogenate, 100 \u03bcl of radioligand, (0.5 nM <sup>3</sup>H-Rol5-1788 [<sup>3</sup>H-Flumazenil] , specific activity 80 Ci/mmol) , and test compound or control (see below) , and are brought to a total volume of 500 \u03bcl with Buffer A. Incubations are carried for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C and then rapidly filtered through Whatman GFB filters to separate free and bound ligand. Filters are washed twice with fresh Buffer A and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Nonspecific binding (control) is determined by displacement of <sup>3</sup>H Rol5-1788 with 10 \u03bcM Diazepam (Research Biochemicals International, Natick, MA) . Data were collected in triplicate, averaged, and percent inhibition of total specific binding (Total Specific Binding = Total - Nonspecific) was calculated for each compound. \n\n A competition binding curve is obtained with up to 11 points spanning the compound concentration range from 10<sup>\"12</sup>M to 10<sup>\"5</sup>M obtained per curve by the method described above for determining percent inhibition. Ki values are calculated according the Cheng-Prussof equation. When tested using this assay, preferred compounds of Formula I exhibit Ki values of less than 1 uM, more preferred compounds of the invention have i values of less than 500 nM, and particularly preferred compounds have Ki values of less than 100 nM.</p>Example 147</p>Electrophysiology</p>The following assay is used to determine if a compound of the invention act as an agonist, an antagonist, or an inverse agonist at the benzodiazepine site of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor.</p>Assays are carried out as described in White and Gurley (NeuroReport 6: 1313-1316, 1995) and White, Gurley, Hartnett, Stirling, and Gregory (Receptors and Channels 3_: 1-5, 1995) with modifications. Electrophysiological recordings are carried out using the two electrode voltage- clamp technique at a membrane holding potential of -70 mV.
