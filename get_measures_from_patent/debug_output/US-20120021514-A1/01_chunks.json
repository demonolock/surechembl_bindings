In vitro gene silencing activity for compositions comprising mixed polymeric micelles formulated with siRNA.</p>FIGS. 11A and 11B demonstrate that mixed polymeric micelles prepared as described herein were effective to knockdown gene expression activity under several formulation conditions. Knock-down (KD) activity of compositions comprising a heterogeneous polymeric micelle and an associated polynucleotide (e.g., an siRNA known to have knock-down activity for GAPDH gene expression) was determined.</p>Specifically, two separate homogenous micelles\u2014one homogeneous micelle consisting essentially of a singular block copolymer 4.1, having a representative formula</p>[D]<sub>14K</sub>-[B<sub>50</sub>-P<sub>25</sub>-D<sub>25</sub>]<sub>30K</sub>\u2003\u2003(4.1)\n</p>(designated as micelle \u201cP7-2\u201d in FIG. 11), and independently, another homogeneous micelle consisting essentially of a singular block copolymer 4.8, having a representative formula</p>[PEGMA]<sub>40K</sub>-[B<sub>53</sub>-P<sub>26</sub>-D<sub>21</sub>]<sub>60K</sub>\u2003\u2003(4.8)\n</p>(designated as micelle \u201cPEGMA 100\u201d in FIG. 11) were evaluated. Heterogeneous micelles formed with different relative ratios of polymer 4.1 and polymer 4.8-M5.1 (50%/50%) (designated as micelle \u201cMM 50/50\u201d in FIG. 11) and M5.2 (25%/75%) (designated as micelle \u201cMM 25/75\u201d in FIG. 11), were also evaluated.</p>Variations in siRNA-formulation protocols were also evaluated. In a first set of experiments, (FIG. 11A, left panel), siRNA was associated, independently, with each of the aforementioned homogeneous polymeric micelles (homogeneous-4.1-micelle; homogeneous-4.8 micelle), and heterogeneous polymeric micelles (M5.1 and M5.2) substantially as described in Example B.3.1 using, in each case, a 25 nM siRNA and concentrations of total polymer as indicated in the as",
    "A 100\u201d in FIGS. 11A and 11B) having a hydrophilic shell consisting essentially neutral PEGMA monomeric residue showed little or no knock-down activity whereas the homogeneous-4.1-micelle (designated as \u201cP7-2\u201d in FIGS. 11A and 11B) having a hydrophilic shell consisting essentially cationic DMAEMA monomeric residue showed substantial knock-down activity. These observed results are consistent with siRNA binding determined for homogeneous micelles formed from substantially similar polymers 4.7 (no binding) and 4.6 (IC<sub>50 </sub>3.75 ug/ml) as observed in Example 6.A (FIG. 9). The mixed polymer micelle M5.1 comprising the block copolymers 4.1 and 4.8 (50% 150%) (designated as \u201cMM 50/50\u201d in FIGS. 11A and 11B) having a hydrophilic shell consisting essentially of equal molar amounts cationic DMAEMA and neutral PEGMA monomeric residues has knockdown activity substantially similar to the homogeneous-4.1-micelle (designated as \u201cP7-2\u201d in FIGS. 11A and 11B). Notably, however, the heterogeneous micelle M5.1 is expected to have reduced in vivo toxicity as compared to the homogeneous-4,1-micelle, based on in-vivo toxicity data for similarly-constituted heterogeneous micelle M.3.4 (non-toxic dose at least 20 mg/kg) and homogeneous micelle formed from polymers 4.6 (non-toxic dose&lt;11.5 mg/kg) as observed in Example 6.A (FIG. 9). Therefore, these data demonstrate that compositions comprising heterogeneous micelles and siRNA associated therewith have significant activity for siRNA-mediated inhibition of gene expression, with reduced toxicity (relative to homogeneous micelles formed from common constituent polymers).</p>The various examples herein are to be considered illustrative, and not defining the scope of the invention.</p>"
