    "ell. For example, the alginate polymers may be de-crosslinked so as to dissolve the microwells after the spheroids are fully formed and/or pre-vascularized. Dissolving the alginate microwells leaves the spheroids floating in a solution, which may be gently pipetted into tubes, spun down and resuspended in whichever media is desirable for cell delivery. The dissolvable alginate provides a gentle but effective way of harvesting the spheroids for future therapeutic use.</p>The construct can have a large number of microwells, for example, at least 1000 microwells. For example, the construct may be molded using alginate. A master mold for the alginate microwell construct may be fabricated using SU-8 patterned on 3-inch silicon wafers by photolithography. A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) replica may be formed from the master mold and made hydrophilic by plasma treatment. The PMDS replica may be submerged in distilled water to retain their hydrophilicity. The PMDS replica can then be autoclaved and cooled prior to casting.</p>Cold collagen solutions may be mixed with cold 1.6% w/v alginate in a 1:1 ratio. The resulting collagen-alginate solution may be placed on ice before pipetting the solution into the PDMS mold. Thus, the hydrogels contained a constant amount of alginate (0.8% w/v), which may be selected to be a minimum amount to support molding and handling of microfluidic hydrogels at low collagen density. The top of the molds may be closed with cellulose dialysis membranes (6000 kD MWCO). The membranes may be flattened, for example, by using the edge of a sterile glass slide. The collagen component may be allowed to gel for 50 min at either room temperature or 37\u00b0 C. before pipetting a 60 mM CaCl<sub>2 </sub>HEPES buffer solution on top of the membrane for at least 45 min to crosslink the alginate at room temperature. The hydrogels may be removed from the molds and placed in HEPES saline buffer solution supplemented with 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2 </sub>to prevent leaching of the calcium ions from the hydrogels.</p>The GFP-labelled human umbilical vein endothelial cells (GFP-hUVECs) may be cultured in Endothelial Growth Medium 2 at 37\u00b0 C. and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The hUVECs may be passaged gently using TrypLE and used only until passage P6. The RFP-labelled mouse mesenchymal stem cells (RFP-mMSCs) may be cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% PenStrep at 37\u00b0 C. and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The mMSCs can also be passaged gently using TrypLE and used only until passage P8.</p>To culture the spheroids, the 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2 </sub>solution that the alginate microwells were stored in may be removed and replaced with enough DMEM media to cover the constructs. The microwell constructs can then be placed in the incubator at 37\u00b0 C. and 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>to equilibrate for 20 minutes. Then the media may be removed and the microwell constructs gently dried using surgical spears. The spheroids can then be seeded in the microwells using a positive displacement pipette with 20 \u03bcL of"
