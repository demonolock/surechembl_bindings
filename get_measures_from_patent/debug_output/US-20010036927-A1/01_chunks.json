Preparation of the Complexes Glycerolipids pcTG20, Optionally DOPE,-DNA </p>[0182] The quantities of lipids are calculated as described above based on the concentration of final DNA (0.1 mg/ml for the tests in vitro), the desired charge ratio, the molar mass and the number of positive charges of the cationic lipid chosen. The lipids are mixed in a glass tube, sterilized with alcohol and with UV, in order to obtain a 2 mM cationic lipid solution (see above). The solvents are evaporated and the lipid film is taken up in a solution of n-octyl, P-D-glucopyranoside (octylglucoside, Sigma, 0 9882) according to a cationic lipid/detergent ratio of 1:5 (mol:mol). </p>[0183] 253 \u03bcl of a 20 mM octylglucoside solution in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5 are collected and used to take up the film of pcTG20/DOPE lipid mixture. The plasmid DNA is prepared from a stock solution of plasmid DNA at 1 mg/ml of which 50 \u03bcl are placed in 0.5 ml (0.1 mg/ml final) to which 323.5 \u03bcl of 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5 are added. 126.5 \u03bcl of the lipid suspension are added to the DNA by aspirating and discharging 10 times using a pipette in order to obtain the final suspension *at 0.1 mg/ml of DNA and a +/\u2212 charge ratio of 10. To remove the detergent, a dialysis of 3 times 4 hours at room temperature against 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5 is carried out in dialysis microbags (cut-off of 13.2 kD; Sartorius, Gottingen, Germany). The dialyzed DNA/lipid complexes are stored at +4\u00b0 C. The preparation is carried out in a laminar flow cabinet. </p>[0184] The complexes are obtained whose characteristics are indicated in Table I below. </p>[0185] 2. Preparation of the Complexes Glycerolipids pcTG35, Optionally DOPE,-DNA </p>[0186] The same protocol is applied as above. </p>[0187] D. Preparation of the Lipid-DNA Complexes By Sonication Extrusion </p>[0188] The quantities of lipids are calculated as described above based on the concentration of final DNA (0.1 mg/ml for the tests in vitro), the desired charge ratio, the molar mass and the number of positive charges of the cationic lipid chosen. The lipids are mixed in a glass tube, sterilized with alcohol and with UV, in order to obtain a 2 mM cationic lipid solution, as indicated above. The solvents are evaporated and the lipid film is taken up in 900 \u03bcl of 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5 at 4\u00b0 C. for about 16 h. The suspension is sonicated in a sonication bath (Bransonic 221) to visual homogeneity. The lipid suspension is extruded through two membranes with a pore diameter of 0.2 \u03bcm (Nucleopore, Costar, Cambridge, Mass., USA) and rinsed with 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5 (extruder from Lipex Biomembranes, Vancouver, Canada) at a maximum pressure of 50 bars. The lipid suspension is kept at room temperature for 1 hour. 450 \u03bcl of the lipid suspension are added to 50 \u03bcl of a stock solution of plasmid DNA (1 mg/ml) and mixed by aspirating/discharging "
