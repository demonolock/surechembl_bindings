    "BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe mammalian bombesin (Bn)-related peptides,\ngastrin-releasing peptide (GRP.), neuromedin B (NMB), and\nneuromedin C (NMC) have a wide range of biological\neffects. These include chemotaxis, contraction of smooth\nmuscle stimulation, and the release of numerous\ngastrointestinal hormones. GRP and NMB are also active\nin the central nervous system, affecting\nthermoregulation, behavioral effects, satiety,\nmaintenance of circadian rhythm, and inhibition of TSH\nrelease. Bn-related peptides function as a growth factor\nin numerous normal cells (e.g., stomal, epithelial, and\nneuroendocrine cells) as well as neoplastic cells such as\nhuman small cell lung cancer cells, non-small cell lung\ncancer cells, rat hepatocellular tumor cells, prostatic\ncells and breast adenocarcinoma cells.</p>Recent structure and cloning studies demonstrate\nthat Bn-related peptides mediate the actions of two\ndistinct receptor classes. GRP has a high affinity, and \nNMB has a low affinity, for the GRP-preferring class or\nsubtype (GRP receptor or GRP-R). In contrast, GRP has a\nlow affinity, and NMB has a high affinity, for the other\nclass, the NMB-preferring subtype (NMB receptor or NMB-R).\nBoth receptor classes are present throughout the\ncentral nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract.</p>Native somatostatin, somatostatin-14 (SS-14), has\nbeen shown to inhibit the cross-linking of <sup>125</sup>I-GRP to a\n120 kD protein in Triton\u00ae extracts of 3T3 cells and human\nsmall cell lung cancer cells which are known to possess\nbombesin receptors. Recently, somatostatin octapeptide\nanalogs have also demonstrated binding affinity to NMB-R\nin Orbuch, et al., Mol. Pharmacol., 44:841 (1993). These\nanalogs, however, also maintain a substantial activity\nfor somatostatin receptors.</p>WO94/02163 describes a method of selectivity inhibiting\nbiochemical activity of cells induced by neuromedin B.\nThe method includes the step of contacting cells which\ncontain neuromedin B receptor with a cyclic octapeptide,\nhaving lysinc or ornithine at position 5.</p>EP0389180 describes octapeptides exhibiting GH-releasing-inhibiting\nactivity. The octapeptides have lysine at\nposition 5.</p>EP0215171 describes octapeptides active in inhibiting the\nsecretion of GH, insulin and glucagon. The octapeptides\nhave lysine at position 5.</p>EP0298732 describes a peptide comprising the sequence -\nCys-X-D-Trp-Lys-Val-Cys wherein X represents any amino\nacid residue. </p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONAbbreviationsNal = 3- (2-naphtyhl)-alanine or 3- (1-naphthyl) -alanineBpa = 3-(4-biphenyl)-alanineX-Phe = phenylalanine with a p-, o- or m-substituent,\nsuch as -OH, CH<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and halogen, on the phenyl ring,\ne.g., 3-(4-chloropheny,1)-alanineF<sub>5</sub>Phe = 3-(pentafluorophenyl)-alanineNle=norleucineMe-Trp = Trp with a methyl-substituted indolyl nitrogen\n\u2003\u2003\u2003Dab = 2,4-diamino butyric acid\n\u2003\u2003\u2003Aub = 2-amino butyric acid<",
    "en fluoride was evaporated rapidly under a stream\nof dry nitrogen. Free peptide was precipitated and \nwashed with ether. The crude peptide was then dissolved\nin 250 ml of 90% acetic acid to which was added a\nconcentrated solution of I<sub>2</sub>/MeOH until a permanent brown\ncolor was observed. Excess I<sub>2</sub> was removed by addition of\nascorbic acid and the solution was reduced to a small\nvolume by evaporation. The crude peptide solution was\napplied to a column (2.5 x 90 cm) of SEPHADEX\u2122 G-25 and\neluted with 50% acetic acid. Fractions containing a\nmajor component by UV absorption and TLC were then\npooled, reduced to a small volume by evaporation and\napplied to a column (1.5 x 70 cm) of VYDAC\u00ae\noctadecylsilane silica (10-15 \u00b5) (Vydac, Hesperia, CA)\nfollowed by elution with a linear gradient of\nacetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water.\nFractions were examined by TLC and analytical high\nperformance liquid chromatography and pooled to give\nmaximum purity.</p>Repeated lyophilization of the solution from water\ngave 97 mg of the product as a white, fluffy powder. The\nproduct was found to be homogeneous by HPLC and TLC.\nAmino acid analysis of an acid hydrolysate and FAB MS\nconfirmed the composition of the octapeptide.</p>Example 2NMB Receptor Binding AssayThe procedure for transfecting the rat NMB\nreceptor into BALB-3T3 fibroblasts is discussed in Wada,\net al., Neuron, 6:4221-430 (1991) and Benya, et al., Mol.\nPharmacol., 42:1058 (1992). Membranes for the NMB\nreceptor binding assay were obtained by homogenizing\nBALB-3T3 fibroblasts, transfected with the rat NMB\nreceptor, with a POLYTRON\u2122 tissue homogenizer (setting 6,\n15 sec) (Brinkman, Westbury, NY) in ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl\n(Buffer A) (Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) and\ncentrifuging twice at \n39,000 x g (10 min), with an intermediate resuspension in\nfresh Buffer A. The final pellets were resuspended in\nthe 50 mM Tris-HCl, containing 0.1 mg/ml bacitracin\n(Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, MO), and 0.1% bovine serum\nalbumin (BSA) (Buffer B) (Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis,\nMO), and held on ice for the receptor binding assay.\nAliquots (0.4 ml) were incubated with 0.05 ml [<sup>125</sup>I-Tyr<sup>4</sup>]bombesin\n(-2200 Ci/mmole) (New England Nuclear, Boston, MA) in\nBuffer B, with and without 0.05 ml of unlabeled NMB\nanalogs. After a 30 min incubation (4\u00b0C), the bound\n[<sup>125</sup>I-Tyr<sup>4</sup>]bombesin was separated from the free by rapid\nfiltration through WHATMAN\u2122 GF/B filters which had been\npreviously soaked in 0.3% polyethyleneimine using a\nBrandel filtration manifold (Brandel, Gaithersberg, MD).\nThe filters were then washed three times with 5 ml\naliquots of ice-cold Buffer A. Specific binding was\ndefined as the total [<sup>125</sup>I]bombesin bound minus that bound\nin the presence of 1 \u00b5M unlabeled NMB. Analogs of the\ninvention had a high binding affinity for the NMB\nreceptor. Examples of the NMB receptor binding assay\nresults for three analogs of the invention were (K<sub>i</sub>\nvalues in nM) 47.4 \u00b1 10.3 (peptide Arg<sup>5</sup>), and 85.1 \u00b1 2.7\n(peptide Dab<sup>5</sup>).</p>Example 3GRP Receptor Binding AssayMembranes for the GRP receptor binding assay were\nobtained by homogenizing cultured AR42J cells with a\nPolytron\u2122 tissue homogenizer (setting 6, 15 sec) in ice-cold\n50 mM Tris-HCl (Buffer A) and centrifuging twice at\n39,000 x g (10 min), with an intermediate resuspension in\nfresh Buffer A. The final pellets were resuspended in\nthe 50 mM Tris-HCl containing 0.1 mg/ml bacitracin and\n0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Buffer B) and held on \nice for the GRP receptor binding assay. Aliquots (0.4\nml) were incubated with 0.05 ml of [<sup>125</sup>I-Tyr<sup>4</sup>]bombesin\n(-2200 Ci/mmole) in Buffer B, with and without 0.05 ml of\nunlabeled NMB analogs. After a 30 min incubation (4\u00b0C),\nthe bound [<sup>125</sup>I]-Tyr<sup>4</sup>]bombesin was separated from the free\nby rapid filtration through WHATMAN\u2122 GF/B filters which\nhad been previously soaked in 0.3% polyethyleneimine\nusing a Brandel\u2122 filtration manifold. The filters were\nthen washed three times with 5 ml aliquots of ice-cold\nBuffer A. specific binding was defined as the tatal\n[<sup>125</sup>I-Tyr<sup>4</sup>]bombesin bound minus that bound in the presence\nof 1 \u00b5M unlabeled GRP. Analogs of the invention had a\nweak binding affinity for the GRP receptor. Examples of\nthe GRP receptor binding assay results for analogs of the\ninvention were (K<sub>i</sub> values in nM) 2921 \u00b1 250 (peptide Arg<sup>5</sup>)\nand 2632 \u00b1 216 (peptide Dab<sup>5</sup>).</p>Example 4Somatostatin Receptor Binding AssayMembranes for the somatostatin receptor binding\nassay were obtained by homogenizing cultured AR42J acinar\npancreas cells with a Polytron\u2122 tissue homogenizer\n(setting 6, 15 sec), in ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl (Buffer\nA) and centrifuging twice at 39,000 x g (10 min), with an\nintermediate resuspension in fresh Buffer A. The final\npellets were resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl for the\nreceptor binding assay. For determination of the K<sub>i</sub>\nvalues, the various concentrations of NMB analogs were\nincubated for\n90 min at 25\u00b0C with approximately 0.05 nM [<sup>125</sup>I]MK-678\n(University of Arizona, School of Medicine, Tucson, AZ)\nin 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) (Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, MO)\ncontaining BSA (fraction V) (10 mg/ml) (Sigma Chemicals,\nSt. Louis, MO), MgCl<sub>2</sub> (5 mM) (Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis,\nMO), aprotinin (200 KIU/ml) (Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, \nMO) bacitracin (0.02 mg/ml), and phenylmethylsulphonyl\nfluoride (0.02 mg/ml) (Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, MO).\nThe final assay volume was 0.3 ml. The incubations were\nterminated by rapid filtration through GF/C filters (presoaked\nin 0.3% polyethylenimine) using a BRANDEL\u2122\nfiltration manifold. Each tube and filter were then\nwashed three times with 5 ml aliquots of ice-cold buffer.\nSpecific binding was defined as the total [<sup>125</sup>I]MK-678\nbound minus that bound in the presence of 200 nM MK-678.\nA known cyclic octapeptide\nD-Nal-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Val-Cys-Nal-NH<sub>2</sub> (Lys<sup>5</sup>) was\ndisclosed in Orbuch et al., Mol. Pharmacol. 44:841\n(1993), and had an extremely high affinity for the\nsomatostatin receptor\n(K<sub>i</sub> = 0.84 \u00b1 0.53). In contrast, analogs of the\ninvention had a much lower affinity, in a range of about\none hundredth or one thousandth the K<sub>i</sub> value of Lys<sup>5</sup>, For\nexample, K<sub>i</sub> values (nM) for analogs of the invention were\n407 \u00b1 82 (peptide D"
