    "l Application Ser. No. 61/787,081 filed on Mar. 15, 2013 which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates generally to novel macrocyclic compounds, and their analogues thereof, which are inhibitors of factor XIa and/or plasma kallikrein, compositions containing them, and methods of using them, for example, for the treatment or prophylaxis of thromboembolic disorders, or for the treatment of retinal vascular permeability associated with diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema.</p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThromboembolic diseases remain the leading cause of death in developed countries despite the availability of anticoagulants such as warfarin (COUMADIN\u00ae), heparin, low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), and synthetic pentasaccharides and antiplatelet agents such as aspirin and clopidogrel (PLAVIX\u00ae). The oral anticoagulant warfarin, inhibits the post-translational maturation of coagulation factors VII, IX, X and prothrombin, and has proven effective in both venous and arterial thrombosis. However, its usage is limited due to its narrow therapeutic index, slow onset of therapeutic effect, numerous dietary and drug interactions, and a need for monitoring and dose adjustment. Thus discovering and developing safe and efficacious oral anticoagulants for the prevention and treatment of a wide range of thromboembolic disorders has become increasingly important.</p>One approach is to inhibit thrombin generation by targeting the inhibition of coagulation factor XIa (FXIa). Factor XIa is a plasma serine protease involved in the regulation of blood coagulation, which is initiated in vivo by the binding of tissue factor (TF) to factor VII (FVII) to generate factor VIIa (FVIIa). The resulting TF:FVIIa complex activates factor IX (FIX) and factor X (FX) that leads to the production of factor Xa (FXa). The generated FXa catalyzes the transformation of prothrombin into small amounts of thrombin before this pathway is shut down by tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). The process of coagulation is then further propagated via the feedback activation of Factors V, VIII and XI by catalytic amounts of thrombin. (Gailani, D. et al., Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol., 27:2507-2513 (2007).) The resulting burst of thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin that polymerizes to form the structural framework of a blood clot, and activates platelets, which are a key cellular component of coagulation (Hoffman, M., Blood Reviews, 17:S1-S5 (2003)). Therefore, factor XIa plays a key role in propagating this amplification loop and is thus an attractive target for anti-thrombotic therapy.</p>Plasma prekallikrein is a zymogen of a trypsin-like serine protease and is present in plasma at 35 to 50 \u03bcg/mL. The gene structure is similar to that of factor XI. Overall, the amino acid sequence of plasma kallikrein has 58% homology to factor XI. Plasma kallikrein is thought to play a role in a number of inflammatory disorders. The major ",

Furthermore, baboon cross-reactive, function blocking antibodies to human factor XI protect against baboon arterial-venous shunt thrombosis (Gruber et al., Blood, 102:953-955 (2003)). Evidence for an antithrombotic effect of small molecule inhibitors of factor XIa is also disclosed in published U.S. Patent Publication No. 2004/0180855 A1. Taken together, these studies suggest that targeting factor XI will reduce the propensity for thrombotic and thromboembolic diseases.</p>Genetic evidence indicates that factor XI is not required for normal homeostasis, implying a superior safety profile of the factor XI mechanism compared to competing antithrombotic mechanisms. In contrast to hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency) or hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency), mutations of the factor XI gene causing factor XI deficiency (hemophilia C) result in only a mild to moderate bleeding diathesis characterized primarily by postoperative or posttraumatic, but rarely spontaneous hemorrhage. Postoperative bleeding occurs mostly in tissue with high concentrations of endogenous fibrinolytic activity (e.g., oral cavity, and urogenital system). The majority of the cases are fortuitously identified by preoperative prolongation of aPTT (intrinsic system) without any prior bleeding history.</p>The increased safety of inhibition of XIa as an anticoagulation therapy is further supported by the fact that Factor XI knock-out mice, which have no detectable factor XI protein, undergo normal development, and have a normal life span. No evidence for spontaneous bleeding has been noted. The aPTT (intrinsic system) is prolonged in a gene dose-dependent fashion. Interestingly, even after severe stimulation of the coagulation system (tail transection), the bleeding time is not significantly prolonged compared to wild-type and heterozygous litter mates. (Gailani, D., Frontiers in Bioscience, 6:201-207 (2001); Gailani, D. et al., Blood Coagulation andFibrinolysis, 8:134-144 (1997).) Taken together, these observations suggest that high levels of inhibition of factor XIa should be well tolerated. This is in contrast to gene targeting experiments with other coagulation factors, excluding factor XII.</p>In vivo activation of factor XI can be determined by complex formation with either C1 inhibitor or alpha 1 antitrypsin. In a study of 50 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), approximately 25% of the patients had values above the upper normal range of the complex ELISA. This study can be viewed as evidence that at least in a subpopulation of patients with AMI, factor XI activation contributes to thrombin formation (Minnema, M. C. et al., Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol., 20:2489-2493 (2000)). A second study establishes a positive correlation between the extent of coronary arteriosclerosis and factor XIa in complex with alpha 1 antitrypsin (Murakami, T. et al., Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol., 15:1107-1113 (1995)). In another study, Factor XI levels above the 90th percentile in patients were associated with a 2.2-fold increased risk for venous thrombosis (Meijers, J. C. M. et al., N. Engl. J. Med., 342:696-701 (2000)).</p>Also, it is preferred to find new compounds with improved activity in in vitro clotting assays, compared with known serine protease inhibitors, such as the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) or prothrombin time (PT) assay. (for a description of the aPTT and PT assays see, Goodnight, S. H. et al., \u201cScreening Tests of Hemostasis\u201d, Disorders of Thrombosis and Hemostasis: A Clinical G",
    "ve been approved by the FDA for these indications.</p>There are three main clinical situations when considering the prevention of VTE in a medical cancer patient: (i) the patient is bedridden for prolonged periods of time; (ii) the ambulatory patient is receiving chemotherapy or radiation; and (iii) the patient is with indwelling central vein catheters. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are effective antithrombotic agents in cancer patients undergoing surgery. (Mismetti, P. et al., British Journal of Surgery, 88:913-930 (2001).)</p>A. In Vitro Assays</p>The effectiveness of compounds of the present invention as inhibitors of the coagulation Factors XIa, VIIa, IXa, Xa, XIIa, plasma kallikrein or thrombin, can be determined using a relevant purified serine protease, respectively, and an appropriate synthetic substrate. The rate of hydrolysis of the chromogenic or fluorogenic substrate by the relevant serine protease was measured both in the absence and presence of compounds of the present invention. Hydrolysis of the substrate resulted in the release of pNA (para nitroaniline), which was monitored spectrophotometrically by measuring the increase in absorbance at 405 nm, or the release of AMC (amino methylcoumarin), which was monitored spectrofluorometrically by measuring the increase in emission at 460 nm with excitation at 380 nm. A decrease in the rate of absorbance or fluorescence change in the presence of inhibitor is indicative of enzyme inhibition. Such methods are known to one skilled in the art. The results of this assay are expressed as the inhibitory constant, K<sub>i</sub>.</p>Factor XIa determinations were made in 50 mM HEPES buffer at pH 7.4 containing 145 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, and 0.1% PEG 8000 (polyethylene glycol; JT Baker or Fisher Scientific). Determinations were made using purified human Factor XIa at a final concentration of 25-200 pM (Haematologic Technologies) and the synthetic substrate S-2366 (pyroGlu-Pro-Arg-pNA; CHROMOGENIX\u00ae or AnaSpec) at a concentration of 0.0002-0.001 M.</p>Factor VIIa determinations were made in 0.005 M calcium chloride, 0.15 M sodium chloride, 0.05 M HEPES buffer containing 0.1% PEG 8000 at a pH of 7.5. Determinations were made using purified human Factor VIIa (Haematologic Technologies) or recombinant human Factor VIIa (Novo Nordisk) at a final assay concentration of 0.5-10 nM, recombinant soluble tissue factor at a concentration of 10-40 nM and the synthetic substrate H-D-Ile-Pro-Arg-pNA (S-2288; CHROMOGENIX\u00ae or BMPM-2; AnaSpec) at a concentration of 0.001-0.0075 M.</p>Factor IXa determinations were made in 0.005 M calcium chloride, 0.1 M sodium chloride, 0.0000001 M Refludan (Berlex), 0.05 M TRIS base and 0.5% PEG 8000 at a pH of 7.4. Refludan was added to inhibit small amounts of thrombin in the commercial preparations of human Factor IXa. Determinations were made using purified human Factor IXa (Haematologic Technologies) at a final assay concentration of 20-100 nM",
    "g-pNA; CHROMOGENIX\u00ae or AnaSpec) at a concentration of 0.0002-0.0004 M.</p>The Michaelis constant, K<sub>m</sub>, for substrate hydrolysis by each protease, was determined at 25\u00b0 C. or 37\u00b0 C. in the absence of inhibitor. Values of K<sub>i </sub>were determined by allowing the protease to react with the substrate in the presence of the inhibitor.</p>Reactions were allowed to go for periods of 20-180 minutes (depending on the protease) and the velocities (rate of absorbance or fluorescence change versus time) were measured.</p>The following relationships were used to calculate K<sub>i </sub>values:</p>(V<sub>max</sub>*S)/(K<sub>m</sub>+S)</p>(v<sub>o</sub>\u2212v<sub>s</sub>)/v<sub>s</sub>=I/(K<sub>i</sub>(1+S/K<sub>m</sub>)) for a competitive inhibitor with one binding site; or</p>v<sub>s</sub>/v<sub>o</sub>=A+((B\u2212A)/1+((IC<sub>50</sub>/(I)<sub>n</sub>))); and</p>K<sub>i</sub>=IC<sub>50</sub>/(1+S/K<sub>m</sub>) for a competitive inhibitor</p>where:</p>v<sub>o </sub>is the velocity of the control in the absence of inhibitor;</p>v<sub>s </sub>is the velocity in the presence of inhibitor;</p>V<sub>max </sub>is the maximum reaction velocity;</p>I is the concentration of inhibitor;</p>A is the minimum activity remaining (usually locked at zero);</p>B is the maximum activity remaining (usually locked at 1.0);</p>n is the Hill coefficient, a measure of the number and cooperativity of potential inhibitor binding sites;</p>IC<sub>50 </sub>is the concentration of inhibitor that produces 50% inhibition under the assay conditions;</p>K<sub>i </sub>is the dissociation constant of the enzyme: inhibitor complex;</p>S is the concentration of substrate; and</p>K<sub>m </sub>is the Michaelis constant for the substrate.</p>The selectivity of a compound may be evaluated by taking the ratio of the K<sub>i </sub>value for a given protease with the K<sub>i </sub>value for the protease of interest (i.e., selectivity for FXIa versus protease P=K<sub>i </sub>for protease P/K<sub>i </sub>for FXIa). Compounds with selectivity ratios&gt;20 are considered selective.</p>The effectiveness of compounds of the present invention as inhibitors of coagulation can be determined using a standard or modified clotting assay. An increase in the plasma clotting time in the presence of inhibitor is indicative of anticoagulation. Relative clotting time is the clotting time in the presence of an inhibitor divided by the clotting time in the absence of an inhibitor. The results of this assay may be expressed as IC1.5\u00d7 or IC2\u00d7, the inhibitor concentration required to increase the clotting time by 50 or 100 percent, respectively. The IC1.5\u00d7 or IC2\u00d7 is found by linear interpolation from relative clotting time versus inhibitor concentration plots using inhibitor concentration that spans the IC1.5\u00d7 or IC2\u00d7.</p>Clotting times are determined using citrated normal human plasma as well as plasma obtained from a number of laboratory animal species (e.g., rat, or rabbit). A compound is diluted into plasma beginning with a 10 mM DMSO stock solution. The final concentration of DMSO is less than 2%. Plasma clotting assays are performed in an automated coagulation analyzer (Sysmex, Dade-Behring, Illinois). Similarly, clotting times can be determined from laboratory animal species or humans dosed with compounds of the invention.</p>Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) is determined using ALEXIN\u00ae (Trinity Biotech, Ireland) or ACTIN\u00ae (Dade-Behring, Illinois) following the directions in the package insert. Plasma (0.05 mL) is warmed to 37\u00b0 C. for 1 minute. ALEXIN\u00ae or ACTIN\u00ae (0.05 mL) is added to the plasma and incubated for an additional 2 to 5 minutes. Calcium chloride (25 mM, 0.05 mL) is added to the reaction to initiate coagulation. The clotting time is the time in seconds from the moment calcium chloride is added until a clot is detected.</p>Prothrombin Time (PT) is determined using thromboplastin (Thromboplastin C Plus or Innovin\u00ae, Dade-Behring, Illinois) following the directions in the package insert. Plasma (0.05 mL) is warmed to 37\u00b0 C. for 1 minute. Thromboplastin (0.1 mL) is added to the plasma to initiate coagulation. The clotting time is the time in seconds from the moment thromboplastin is added until a clot is detected.</p>The exemplified Examples disclosed below were tested in the Factor XIa assay described above and found having Factor XIa inhibitory activity.

The ED<sub>50 </sub>(dose that increased average carotid blood flow over 90 min to 50% of the control) of compounds are estimated by a nonlinear least square regression program using the Hill sigmoid E<sub>max </sub>equation (DeltaGraph; SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill.).</p>b. In Vivo Rabbit Arterio-Venous (AV) Shunt Thrombosis Model</p>The rabbit AV shunt model, described by Wong et al. (Wong, P. C. et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 292:351-357 (2000)), can be used in this study. Male New Zealand White rabbits are anesthetized with ketamine (50 mg/kg+50 mg/kg/h IM) and xylazine (10 mg/kg+10 mg/kg/h IM). These anesthetics are supplemented as needed. The femoral artery, jugular vein and femoral vein are isolated and catheterized. A saline-filled AV shunt device is connected between the femoral arterial and the femoral venous cannulae. The AV shunt device consists of an outer piece of tygon tubing (length=8 cm; internal diameter=7.9 mm) and an inner piece of tubing (length=2.5 cm; internal diameter=4.8 mm). The AV shunt also contains an 8-cm-long 2-0 silk thread (Ethicon, Somerville, N.J.). Blood flows from the femoral artery via the AV-shunt into the femoral vein. The exposure of flowing blood to a silk thread induces the formation of a significant thrombus. Forty minutes later, the shunt is disconnected and the silk thread covered with thrombus is weighed. Test agents or vehicle will be given (i.v., i.p., s.c., or orally) prior to the opening of the AV shunt. The percentage inhibition of thrombus formation is determined for each treatment group. The ID<sub>50 </sub>values (dose that produces 50% inhibition of thrombus formation) are estimated by a nonlinear least square regression program using the Hill sigmoid E<sub>max </sub>equation (DeltaGraph; SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill.).</p>The anti-inflammatory effect of these compounds can be demonstrated in an Evans Blue dye extravasation assay using C1-esterase inhibitor deficient mice. In this model, mice are dosed with a compound of the present invention, Evans Blue dye is injected via the tail vein, and extravasation of the blue dye is determined by spectrophotometric means from tissue extracts.</p>The ability of the compounds of the current invention to reduce or prevent the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, for example, as observed during on-pump cardiovascular procedures, can be tested in in vitro perfusion systems, or by on-pump surgical procedures in larger mammals, including dogs and baboons. Read-outs to assess the benefit of the compounds of the present invention include for example reduced platelet loss, reduced platelet/white blood cell complexes, reduced neutrophil elastase levels in plasma, reduced activation of complement factors, and reduced activation and/or consumption of contact activation proteins (plasma kallikrein, factor XII, factor XI, high molecular weight kininogen, C1-esterase inhibitors).</p>The compounds of the present invention may also be useful as inhibitors of additional serine proteases, notably human thrombin, human plasma kallikrein and human plasmin.

Such compounds may be provided in a commercial kit, for example, for use in pharmaceutical research involving thrombin, Factor VIIa, IXa, Xa, XIa, and/or plasma kallikrein. XIa. For example, a compound of the present invention could be used as a reference in an assay to compare its known activity to a compound with an unknown activity. This would ensure the experimentor that the assay was being performed properly and provide a basis for comparison, especially if the test compound was a derivative of the reference compound. When developing new assays or protocols, compounds according to the present invention could be used to test their effectiveness.</p>The compounds of the present invention may also be used in diagnostic assays involving thrombin, Factor VIIa, IXa, Xa, XIa, and/or plasma kallikrein. For example, the presence of thrombin, Factor VIIa, IXa, Xa XIa, and/or plasma kallikrein in an unknown sample could be determined by addition of the relevant chromogenic substrate, for example S2366 for Factor XIa, to a series of solutions containing test sample and optionally one of the compounds of the present invention. If production of pNA is observed in the solutions containing test sample, but not in the presence of a compound of the present invention, then one would conclude Factor XIa was present.</p>Extremely potent and selective compounds of the present invention, those having K<sub>i </sub>val"
