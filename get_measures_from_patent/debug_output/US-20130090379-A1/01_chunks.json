In certain embodiments, administering comprises administering to the animal increasing doses of inhibitor co-dosed with a selected fixed dose of phenol-modified tapentadol prodrug. Detecting prodrug conversion can facilitate identification of a dose of inhibitor and a dose of phenol-modified tapentadol prodrug that provides for a pre-selected pharmacokinetic (PK) profile. Such methods can be conducted as, for example, an in vivo assay or an ex vivo assay.</p>The embodiments include methods for identifying a phenol-modified tapentadol prodrug and a trypsin inhibitor suitable for formulation in a dose unit comprising administering to an animal tissue a phenol-modified tapentadol prodrug and a trypsin inhibitor and detecting phenol-modified tapentadol prodrug conversion, wherein a decrease in phenol-modified tapentadol prodrug conversion in the presence of the trypsin inhibitor as compared to phenol-modified tapentadol prodrug conversion in the absence of the trypsin inhibitor indicates the phenol-modified tapentadol prodrug and trypsin inhibitor are suitable for formulation in a dose unit.</p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURESFIG. 1 is a schematic representing the effect of increasing the level of a GI enzyme inhibitor (\u201cinhibitor\u201d, X axis) on a PK parameter (e.g., drug Cmax) (Y axis) for a fixed dose of prodrug. The effect of inhibitor upon a prodrug PK parameter can range from undetectable, to moderate, to complete inhibition (i.e., no detectable drug release). FIG. 2 provides schematics of drug concentration in plasma (Y axis) over time (X axis). Panel A is a schematic of a pharmacokinetic (PK) profile following ingestion of prodrug with a GI enzyme inhibitor (dashed line) where the drug Cmax is modified relative to that of prodrug without inhibitor (solid line). Panel B is a schematic of a PK profile following ingestion of prodrug with inhibitor (dashed line) where drug Cmax and drug Tmax are modified relative to that of prodrug without inhibitor (solid line). Panel C is a schematic of a PK profile following ingestion of prodrug with inhibitor (dashed line) where drug Tmax is modified relative to that of prodrug without inhibitor (solid line).</p>FIG. 3 provides schematics representing differential concentration-dose PK profiles that can result from the dosing of multiples of a dose unit (X axis) of the present disclosure. Different PK profiles (as exemplified herein for a representative PK parameter, drug Cmax (Y axis)) can be provided by adjusting the relative amount of prodrug and GI enzyme inhibitor contained in a single dose unit or by using a different prodrug or inhibitor in the dose unit.</p>FIG. 4 shows a plasma concentration time course of the production of tapentadol following intravenous (IV) dosing of prodrug Compound TP-1 in rats.</p>FIG. 5 compares mean plasma concentrations over time of tapentadol release following oral administration of prodrug Compound TP-1 alone and",

Such a profile can be a relationship of drug concentration over time (i.e., a \u201cconcentration-time PK profile\u201d) or a relationship of drug concentration versus number of doses ingested (i.e., a \u201cconcentration-dose PK profile\u201d). A PK profile is characterized by PK parameters.</p>\u201cPK parameter\u201d refers to a measure of drug concentration in blood or plasma, such as: 1) \u201cdrug Cmax\u201d, the maximum concentration of drug achieved in blood or plasma; 2) \u201cdrug Tmax\u201d, the time elapsed following ingestion to achieve Cmax; and 3) \u201cdrug exposure\u201d, the total concentration of drug present in blood or plasma over a selected period of time, which can be measured using the area under the curve (AUC) of a time course of drug release over a selected period of time (t). Modification of one or more PK parameters provides for a modified PK profile.</p>\u201cPharmacodynamic (PD) profile\u201d refers to a profile of the efficacy of a drug in a patient (or subject or user), which is characterized by PD parameters. \u201cPD parameters\u201d include \u201cdrug Emax\u201d (the maximum drug efficacy), \u201cdrug EC50\u201d (the concentration of drug at 50% of the Emax) and side effects.</p>\u201cGastrointestinal enzyme\u201d or \u201cGI enzyme\u201d refers to an enzyme located in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which encompasses the anatomical sites from mouth to anus. Trypsin is an example of a GI enzyme.</p>\u201cGastrointestinal enzyme-cleavable moiety\u201d or \u201cGI enzyme-cleavable moiety\u201d refers to a group comprising a site susceptible to cleavage by a GI enzyme. For example, a \u201ctrypsin-cleavable moiety\u201d refers to a group comprising a site susceptible to cleavage by trypsin.</p>\u201cGastrointestinal enzyme inhibitor\u201d or \u201cGI enzyme inhibitor\u201d refers to any agent capable of inhibiting the action of a gastrointestinal enzyme on a substrate. The term also encompasses salts of gastrointestinal enzyme inhibitors. For example, a \u201ctrypsin inhibitor\u201d refers to any agent capable of inhibiting the action of trypsin on a substrate.</p>\u201cPharmaceutical composition\u201d refers to at least one compound and can further comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, with which the compound is administered to a patient.</p>\u201cPharmaceutically acceptable salt\u201d refers to a salt of a compound, which possesses the desired pharmacological activity of the compound. Such salts include: (1) acid addition salts, formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like; or formed with organic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, hexanoic acid, cyclopentanepropionic acid, ",
    "me course of drug release over a selected period of time (t). Modification of one or more PK parameters provides for a modified PK profile.</p>For purposes of describing the features of dose units of the present disclosure, \u201cPK parameter values\u201d that define a PK profile include drug Cmax (e.g., tapentadol Cmax), total drug exposure (e.g., area under the curve) (e.g., tapentadol exposure) and 1/(drug Tmax) (such that a decreased 1/Tmax is indicative of a delay in Tmax relative to a reference Tmax) (e.g., 1/tapentadol Tmax). Thus a decrease in a PK parameter value relative to a reference PK parameter value can indicate, for example, a decrease in drug Cmax, a decrease in drug exposure, and/or a delayed Tmax.</p>Dose units of the present disclosure can be adapted to provide for a modified PK profile, e.g., a PK profile that is different from that achieved from dosing a given dose of prodrug in the absence of inhibitor (i.e., without inhibitor). For example, dose units can provide for at least one of decreased drug Cmax, delayed drug Tmax and/or decreased drug exposure compared to ingestion of a dose of prodrug in the same amount but in the absence of inhibitor. Such a modification is due to the inclusion of an inhibitor in the dose unit.</p>As used herein, \u201ca pharmacodynamic (PD) profile\u201d refers to a profile of the efficacy of a drug in a patient (or subject or user), which is characterized by PD parameters. \u201cPD parameters\u201d include \u201cdrug Emax\u201d (the maximum drug efficacy), \u201cdrug EC50\u201d (the concentration of drug at 50% of the Emax) and side effects.</p>FIG. 1 is a schematic illustrating an example of the effect of increasing inhibitor concentrations upon the PK parameter drug Cmax for a fixed dose of prodrug. At low concentrations of inhibitor, there may be no detectable effect on drug release, as illustrated by the plateau portion of the plot of drug Cmax (Y axis) versus inhibitor concentration (X axis). As inhibitor concentration increases, a concentration is reached at which drug release from prodrug is attenuated, causing a decrease in, or suppression of, drug Cmax. Thus, the effect of inhibitor upon a prodrug PK parameter for a dose unit of the present disclosure can range from undetectable, to moderate, to complete inhibition (i.e., no detectable drug release).</p>A dose unit can be adapted to provide for a desired PK profile (e.g., a concentration-time PK profile) following ingestion of a single dose. A dose unit can be adapted to provide for a desired PK profile (e.g., a concentration-dose PK profile) following ingestion of multiple dose units (e.g., at least 2, at least 3, at least 4 or more dose units).</p>Dose Units Providing Modified PK Profiles</p>A combination of a prodrug and an inhibitor in a dose unit can provide a desired (or \u201cpre-selected\u201d) PK profile (e.g., a concentration-time PK profile) following ingestion of a single dose. The PK profile of such a dose unit can be characterized by one or more of a pre-selected drug Cmax, a pre-selected drug Tmax or a pre-selected drug exposure. The PK profile of the dose unit can be modified compared to a PK profile achieved from the equivalent dosage of prodrug in the absence of inhibitor (i.e., a dose that is the same as the dose unit except that it lacks inhibitor).</p>A modified PK profile can have a decreased PK parameter value relative to a reference PK parameter value (e.g., a PK parameter value of a PK profile following ingestion of a dosage of prodrug that is equivalent to a dose unit except without inhibitor). For example, a dose unit can provide for a decreased drug Cmax, decreased drug exposure, and/or delayed drug Tmax.</p>FIG. 2 presents schematic graphs showing examples of modified concentration-time PK profiles of a sin",

Such administration can be enteral (e.g., oral administration). Prodrug conversion can be detected by, for example, detecting a product of prodrug conversion (e.g., released drug or a metabolite of released drug) or detecting prodrug in blood or plasma of the animal at a desired time point(s) following administration.</p>Ex vivo assays, such as a gut loop or inverted gut loop assay, can assess the suitability of a prodrug for use in a dose unit by, for example, administration of the prodrug to a ligated section of the intestine of an animal. Prodrug conversion can be detected by, for example, detecting a product of prodrug conversion (e.g., released drug or a metabolite of released drug) or detecting prodrug in the ligated gut loop of the animal at a desired time point(s) following administration.</p>Inhibitors are generally selected based on, for example, activity in interacting with trypsin that mediates release of drug from a prodrug with which the inhibitor is to be co-dosed. Such assays can be conducted in the presence of enzyme either with or without prodrug. Inhibitors can also be selected according to properties such as half-life in the GI system, potency, avidity, affinity, molecular size and/or enzyme inhibition profile (e.g., steepness of inhibition curve in an enzyme activity assay, inhibition initiation rate). Inhibitors for use in prodrug-inhibitor combinations can be selected through use of in vitro, in vivo and/or ex vivo assays.</p>One embodiment is a method for identifying a prodrug and a trypsin inhibitor suitable for formulation in a dose unit wherein the method comprises combining a prodrug, a trypsin inhibitor, and trypsin in a reaction mixture and detecting prodrug conversion. Such a combination is tested for an interaction between the prodrug, inhibitor and enzyme, i.e., tested to determine how the inhibitor will interact with the enzyme that mediates enzymatically-controlled release of the drug from the prodrug. In one embodiment, a decrease in prodrug conversion in the presence of the trypsin inhibitor as compared to prodrug conversion in the absence of the trypsin inhibitor indicates the prodrug and trypsin inhibitor are suitable for formulation in a dose unit. Such a method can be an in vitro assay.</p>One embodiment is a method for identifying a prodrug and a trypsin inhibitor suitable for formulation in a dose unit wherein the method comprises administering to an animal a prodrug (e.g., Compound PC-5) and a trypsin inhibitor and detecting prodrug conversion.
