    "ug screening which may be used provides for high throughput screening of compounds having suitable binding affinity to the protein of interest, such as described in WO 84/03564. In this method, as applied to KCNQ potassium channel proteins, large numbers of different small test compounds are synthesized on a solid substrate, such as plastic pins or some other surface. The test compounds are reacted with KCNQ potassium channel polypeptide, or fragments thereof, and washed. Bound CNS KCNQ potassium channel polypeptide is then detected by methods well known in the art. Those agents that are identified through the screening methods are assayed and evaluated for their ability to modulate CNS KCNQ potassium channel proteins, preferably to open the channels, employing methods as described herein, e.g., an oocyte expression assay, Example 4). In turn, the agents are further identified as agents to treat migraine, as described herein, e.g., in the in vivo electrophysiology studies described in Example 3.</p>\n  Other screening and small molecule (e.g., drug) detection assays which involve the detection or identification of small molecules that can bind to a CNS KCNQ potassium channel protein, are encompassed by the present invention. Particularly preferred are assays suitable for high throughput screening methodologies. In such binding-based screening or detection assays, a functional assay is not typically required. However, a functional assay can be performed in conjunction with the binding assay, for example, after those molecules which bind to the CNS KCNQ potassium channel have been detected. For the assay, a target protein and a library or panel of compounds (e.g., ligands, drugs, small molecules) to be screened or assayed for binding to the protein target are employed. Preferably, most small molecules that bind to the target protein will \n\nmodulate activity in some manner, due to preferential, higher affinity binding to functional areas or sites on the protein.</p>\n  An example of such an assay is the fluorescence based thermal shift assay (3 -Dimensional Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 3DP, Exton, PA) as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,020,141 and 6,036,920 to Pantohano et al.; see also, J. Zimmerman, 2000, Gen. Eng. News, 20(8)). The assay allows the detection of small molecules (e.g., drugs, ligands) that bind to expressed CNS KCNQ potassium channel polypeptides based on affinity of binding determinations, for example, by analyzing thermal unfolding curves of protein-drug or ligand complexes. The drugs or binding molecules determined by this technique can be further assayed, if desired, by methods to determine if the molecules affect or modulate function or activity of the target protein, for example, if the molecules are openers or activators of the potassium channel polypeptides, using the assays described herein. According to the present invention, the CNS KCNQ potassium channel proteins can be used, for example, as targets in screening assays of candi",
    "east two of the functional chemical groups. The candidate agents often comprise cyclical carbon or heterocyclic structures and/or aromatic or polyaromatic structures substituted with one or more of the above functional groups. Candidate agents are also found among biomolecules including peptides, saccharides, fatty acids, steroids, purines, pyrimidines, derivatives, structural analogs or combinations thereof.</p>\n  Candidate agents are obtained from a wide variety of sources including libraries of synthetic or natural compounds. For example, numerous means are available for random and directed synthesis of a wide variety of organic compounds and biomolecules, including expression of randomized oligonucleotides. Alternatively, libraries of natural compounds in the form of bacterial, fungal, plant and animal extracts are available or readily produced. In addition, natural or synthetically produced libraries and compounds are readily modified through conventional chemical, physical and biochemical means. Known pharmacological agents may be subjected to directed or random chemical modifications, such as acylation, alkylation, esterification, amidif\u03cacation to produce structural analogs. \n\n The determination of the binding of the candidate bioactive agent to a CNS KCNQ potassium channel polypeptide may be accomplished in a number of ways practiced in the art. In one aspect, the candidate bioactive agent is labeled, and binding is determined directly. Where the screening assay is a binding assay, one or more of the molecules may be joined to a label, where the label can directly or indirectly provide a detectable signal. Various labels include radioisotopes, fluorescent and chemiluminescent compounds, specific binding molecules, particles, e.g. magnetic particles, and the like. Specific binding molecules include pairs, such as biotin and streptavidin, digoxin and antidigoxin etc. For the specific binding members, the complementary member would normally be labeled with a molecule which allows detection, in accordance with known procedures. In some embodiments, only one of the components is labeled. Alternatively, more than one component may be labeled with different labels; for example, the CNS KCNQ polypeptide may be labeled with one fluorophor and the candidate agent labeled with another</p>\n  In one embodiment, the candidate bioactive agent is labeled. Labeled candidate bioactive agents are incubated with the KCNQ potassium channel polypeptide for a time sufficient to allow binding, if present. Incubations may be performed at any temperature which facilitates optimal activity, typically between 4\u00b0C and 40\u00b0C. Incubation periods are selected for optimum activity, but may also be optimized to facilitate rapid high throughput screening. Typically between 0.1 and 1 hour is sufficient. Excess reagent is generally removed or washed away. The presence or absence of the labeled component is detected to determine and indicate binding. In a preferred embodiment,"
