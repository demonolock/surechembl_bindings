    " of calcium levels in an intracellular organelle or calcium store (e.g., endoplasmic reticulum) and/or calcium buffering), such as those provided herein. In particular embodiments, the protein(s) include a STIM proteins (including STIM1, STIM2, DSTIM and CSTIM protein) and/or Orai proteins (Orai1, Orai2, Orai3). The cell may endogenously express the protein(s) or recombinantly express the protein(s).</p>Cells for use in the methods may be of any species. In one embodiment, the cells can be eukaryotic cells. In one embodiment, the cells can be yeast, insect (e.g., Drosophila or Anopheles), or mammalian cells. Mammalian cells include, but are not limited to, rodent (e.g., mouse, rat and hamster), primate, monkey, dog, bovine, rabbit and human cells. A variety of cell types can be used in the methods, including, for example, neuronal, nervous system, brain, immune system cells, e.g., T lymphocytes and B cells, primary cells, blood and hematopoietic cells, stromal cells, myeloid cells, lymphoid cells, and a variety of tumor and cancer cells. Particular cells include Drosophila Schneider 2 or S2 cells, human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells, rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells, Jurkat cells, epithelial cells, rhabdomyosarcoma cells, rhabdoid cells, retinoblastoma cells, neuroepithelioma cells, neuroblastoma cells, osteosarcoma cells, fibroblasts, bone marrow stroma cells, erythroleukemia cells and lymphoblast cells. Other cell lines include HEK 293 and 293T, CHO (including CHO-Ki), LTK-, N2A, H6, and HGB. Many such cells and cell lines are available through cell depositories such as, for example, the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, Va.). Primary cells can be obtained by isolation from tissue sources. The generation, maintenance and use of such cells and cell lines is well known.</p>Cells from a known cell line can be used, such as neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, neuroblastoma SK-N-BE(2)C or SK-N-SH cells, human SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma cells, SMS-KCNR cells, human LAN-5 neuroblastoma cells, human GI-CA-N neuroblastoma cells, human GOTO neuroblastoma cells, mouse Neuro 2a (N2A) neuroblastoma cells and/or human IMR 32 neuroblastoma cells, chronic myeloid leukemia cells (e.g., human K562 cells), promyelocytic leukemia cells (e.g., HL60 cells) and histiocytic lymphoma cells (e.g., U937 cells), Burkitt's lymphoma cells (e.g., CA46 cells), B-cells (e.g., NALM6), acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (e.g., MOLT4 cells), T cells (e.g. Jurkat cells) and early T-ALL (e.g., DU528) cells.</p>The choice of a cell for use in an in vitro assay to test the modulation of intracellular calcium by compounds of Formula (I), (II), (IIA) or (IIB) can involve several considerations, including, for example, a particular protein that is being used in the method and a particular aspect or activity of intracellular calcium modulation that is being monitored or assessed in the method.</p>In one embodiment, the modulation of intracellu"
