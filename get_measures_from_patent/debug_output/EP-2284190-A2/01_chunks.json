    "cit a secondary response to a variety of pathogens. Rather, newborn mammals are typically given secondary immunity to pathogens by their mothers. One way in which mothers are known to boost the immune systems of newborns is by providing the newborn with a set of transfer factors. In mammals, transfer factor is provided by a mother to a newborn in colostrum, which is typically replaced by the mother's milk after a day or two. Transfer factor basically transfers the mother's acquired, specific (i.e., delayed-type hypersensitive) immunity to the newborn. This transferred immunity typically conditions the cells of the newborn's immune system to react against pathogens in an antigen-specific manner, as well as in an antigen- or pathogen-nonspecific fashion, until the newborn's immune system is able on its own to defend the newborn from pathogens. Thus, when transfer factor is present, the immune system of the newborn is conditioned to react to pathogens with a hypersensitive response, such as that which occurs with a typical delayed-type hypersensitivity response. Accordingly, transfer factor is said to \"jump start\" the responsiveness of immune systems to pathogens.</p>Much of the research involving transfer factor has been conducted in recent years. Currently, it is believed that transfer factor is a protein with a length of about forty-four (44) amino acids. Transfer factor is believed to have a molecular weight in the range of about 4,000 to about 5,000 Daltons (D), or about 4 kD to about 5 kD. Transfer factor is also believed to include three functional fractions: an inducer fraction; an immune suppressor fraction; and an antigen-specific fraction. Many in the art believe that transfer factor also includes a nucleoside portion, which could be connected to the protein molecule or separate therefrom, that may enhance the ability of transfer factor to cause a mammalian immune system to elicit a secondary immune response. The nucleoside portion may be part of the inducer or suppressor fractions of transfer factor.</p>The antigen-specific region of the antigen-specific transfer factors is believed to comprise about eight (8) to about twelve (12) amino acids. A second highly-conserved region of about ten (10) amino acids is thought to be a very high-affinity T-cell receptor binding region. The remaining amino acids may serve to link the two active regions or may have additional, as yet undiscovered properties. The antigen-specific region of a transfer factor molecule, which is analogous to the known antigen-specific structure of antibodies, but on a much smaller molecular weight scale, appears to be hyper-variable and is adapted to recognize a characteristic protein on one or more pathogens. The inducer and immune suppressor fractions are believed to impart transfer factor with its ability to condition the various cells of the immune system so that the cells are more filly responsive to the pathogenic stimuli in their environment.</p>Sources of Noncellular Immune Sys"
