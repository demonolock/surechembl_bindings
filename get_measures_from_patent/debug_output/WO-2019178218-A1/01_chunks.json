    "ministration and the administration by another. </p> [00107] An\u201cadjuvant\u201d refers to one or more substances that cause stimulation of the immune system. In this context, an adjuvant is used to enhance an immune response to one or more vaccine antigens or antibodies. An adjuvant may be administered to a subject before, in combination with, or after administration of the vaccine. Examples of chemical compounds used as adjuvants include aluminum compounds, oils, block polymers, immune stimulating complexes, vitamins and minerals (e.g., vitamin E, vitamin A, selenium, and vitamin B12), Quil A (saponins), bacterial and fungal cell wall components (e.g., </p>lipopolysaccarides, lipoproteins, and glycoproteins), hormones, cytokines, and co-stimulatory factors. </p> [00108] As used herein, the term\u201cantibody\u201d collectively refers to immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin-like molecules including by way of example and without limitation, IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM, combinations thereof, and similar molecules produced during an immune response in any vertebrate, for example, in mammals such as humans, goats, rabbits and mice, as well as non-mammalian species, such as shark immunoglobulins. As used herein,\u201cantibodies\u201d (includes intact immunoglobulins) and\u201cantigen binding fragments\u201d specifically bind to a molecule of interest (or a group of highly similar molecules of interest) to the substantial exclusion of binding to other molecules (for example, antibodies and antibody fragments that have a binding constant for the molecule of interest that is at least 10<sup>3</sup> M <sup>1</sup> greater, at least 10<sup>4</sup> M <sup>1</sup> greater or at least 10<sup>5</sup> M <sup>1</sup> greater than a binding constant for \n\n other molecules in a biological sample). The term\u201cantibody\u201d also includes genetically engineered forms such as chimeric antibodies (for example, humanized murine antibodies), heteroconjugate antibodies (such as, bispecific antibodies). See also, Pierce Catalog and Handbook, 1994-1995 (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, Ill.); Kuby, J., Immunology, 3<sup>rd</sup> Ed., W.H. Freeman &amp; Co., New York, 1997. </p> [00109] More particularly, antibody refers to a polypeptide ligand comprising at least a light chain immunoglobulin variable region or heavy chain immunoglobulin variable region which specifically recognizes and binds an epitope of an antigen. Antibodies are composed of a heavy and a light chain, each of which has a variable region, termed the variable heavy (VH) region and the variable light (VL) region. Together, the VH region and the VL region are responsible for binding the antigen recognized by the antibody. Typically, an </p>immunoglobulin has heavy (H) chains and light (L) chains interconnected by disulfide bonds. There are two types of light chain, lambda (l) and kappa (K). There are five main heavy chain classes (or isotypes) which determine the functional activity of an antibody molecule: IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA and IgE. Each heavy and light chain contains a constant region and a variable region, (the regions are also known as\u201cdomains\u201d). In combination, the heavy and the light chain variable regions specifically bind the antigen. Light and heav",
    "argets that have a distinct structure, e.g., two different target antigens, two different epitopes on the same target antigen, or a hapten and a target antigen or \n\n epitope on a target antigen. A variety of different bispecific antibody structures are known in the art. In some embodiments, each antigen binding moiety in a bispecific antibody includes VH and/or VL regions; in some such embodiments, the VH and/or VL regions are those found in a particular monoclonal antibody. In some embodiments, the bispecific antibody contains two antigen binding moieties, each including VH and/or VL regions from different monoclonal antibodies. In some embodiments, the bispecific antibody contains two antigen binding moieties, wherein one of the two antigen binding moieties includes an </p>immunoglobulin molecule having VH and/or VL regions that contain CDRs from a first monoclonal antibody, and the other antigen binding moiety includes an antibody fragment (e.g., Fab, F(ab'), F(ab')2, Fd, Fv, dAB, scFv, etc.) having VH and/or VL regions that contain CDRs from a second monoclonal antibody. </p> [00113] As used herein, a\u201cclearing agent\u201d is an agent that binds to excess bispecific antibody that is present in the blood compartment of a subject to facilitate rapid clearance via kidneys. The use of the clearing agent prior to hapten administration (e.g., DOTA) facilitates better tumor-to-background ratios in pre-targeted radioimmunotherapy (PRIT) systems. Examples of clearing agents include 500 kD-dextran-DOTA-Bn(Y) (Orcutt et al., Mol Cancer Ther. 11(6): 1365-1372 (2012)), 500 kD aminodextran-DOTA conjugate, antibodies against the pretargeting antibody, etc. </p> [00114] As used herein, the term\u201cconjugated\u201d refers to the association of two molecules by any method known to those in the art. Suitable types of associations include chemical bonds and physical bonds. Chemical bonds include, for example, covalent bonds and coordinate bonds. Physical bonds include, for instance, hydrogen bonds, dipolar interactions, van der Waal forces, electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic interactions and aromatic stacking. </p> [00115] As used herein, the term\u201cdiabodies\u201d refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a heavy-chain variable domain (VH) connected to a light-chain variable domain (VL) in the same polypeptide chain (VH VL). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, e.g., EP 404,097; </p> WO 93/11161; and 30 Hollinger et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90: 6444-6448 (1993). \n\n [00116] As used herein, the terms\u201csingle-chain antibodies\u201d or\u201csingle-chain Fv (scFv)\u201d refer to an antibody fusion molecule of the two domains of the Fv fragment, VL and VH. Single-chain antibody molecules may comprise a polymer with a number of individual molecules, for example, dimer, trimer or other polymers. Furthermore, although",
    "single-chain antibodies can be prepared by recombinant techniques or enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact antibodies. </p> [00117] Any of the above-noted antibody fragments are obtained using conventional techniques known to those of skill in the art, and the fragments are screened for binding specificity and neutralization activity in the same manner as are intact antibodies. </p> [00118] As used herein, an\u201cantigen\u201d refers to a molecule to which an antibody (or antigen binding fragment thereof) can selectively bind. The target antigen may be a protein, carbohydrate, nucleic acid, lipid, hapten, or other naturally occurring or synthetic compound. In some embodiments, the target antigen may be a carbohydrate (e.g., a polySia species). An antigen may also be administered to an animal to generate an immune response in the animal. </p> [00119] The term\u201cantigen binding fragment\u201d refers to a fragment of the whole immunoglobulin structure which possesses a part of a polypeptide responsible for binding to antigen. Examples of the antigen binding fragment useful in the present technology include scFv, (SCFV)<sub>2</sub>, SCFVFC, Fab, Fab' and F(ab')2, but are not limited thereto. </p> [00120] By\u201cbinding affinity\u201d is meant the strength of the total noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g., an antigen or antigenic peptide). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (KD). Affinity can be measured by standard methods known in the art, including those described herein. A low-affinity complex contains an antibody that generally tends to dissociate readily from the antigen, whereas a high-affinity complex contains an antibody that generally tends to remain bound to the antigen for a longer duration. </p> [00121] As used herein, the term\u201cbiological sample\u201d means sample material derived from living cells. Biological samples may include tissues, cells, protein or membrane extracts of \n\n cells, and biological fluids (e.g., ascites fluid or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)) isolated from a subject, as well as tissues, cells and fluids present within a subject. Biological samples of the present technology include, but are not limited to, samples taken from breast tissue, renal tissue, the uterine cervix, the endometrium, the head or neck, the gallbladder, parotid tissue, the prostate, the brain, the pituitary gland, kidney tissue, muscle, the esophagus, the stomach, the small intestine, the colon, the liver, the spleen, the pancreas, thyroid tissue, heart tissue, lung tissue, the bladder, adipose tissue, lymph node tissue, the uterus, ovarian tissue, adrenal tissue, testis tissue, the tonsils, thymus, blood, hair, buccal, skin, serum, plasma, CSF, semen, prostate fluid, seminal fluid, urine, feces, sweat, saliva, sputum, mucus, bone marrow, lymph, and tears. Biological samples can also be obtained from biopsies of internal organs or from cancers. Biologic",
    "hus, for example, recombinant cells express genes that are not found within the native (non recombinant) form of the cell or express native genes that are otherwise abnormally expressed, under expressed or not expressed at all. </p> [00144] As used herein, the term\u201cseparate\u201d therapeutic use refers to an administration of at least two active ingredients at the same time or at substantially the same time by different routes. </p> [00145] As used herein, the term\u201csequential\u201d therapeutic use refers to administration of at least two active ingredients at different times, the administration route being identical or different. More particularly, sequential use refers to the whole administration of one of the active ingredients before administration of the other or others commences. It is thus possible to administer one of the active ingredients over several minutes, hours, or days before administering the other active ingredient or ingredients. There is no simultaneous treatment in this case. </p> [00146] As used herein,\u201cspecifically binds\u201d refers to a molecule (e.g., an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof) which recognizes and binds another molecule (e.g., an antigen), but that does not substantially recognize and bind other molecules. The terms \u201cspecific binding,\u201d\u201cspecifically binds to,\u201d or is\u201cspecific for\u201d a particular molecule (e.g., a \n\n carbohydrate antigen or an epitope on a carbohydrate antigen), as used herein, can be exhibited, for example, by a molecule having a KD for the molecule to which it binds to of about 1 CP<sup>4</sup> M, lCT<sup>5</sup> M, l(T<sup>6</sup> M, l(T<sup>7</sup> M, l(T<sup>8</sup> M, l(T<sup>9</sup> M, l(T<sup>10</sup> M, KT<sup>n</sup> M, or l(T<sup>12</sup> M. The term\u201cspecifically binds\u201d may also refer to binding where a molecule ( e.g ., an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof) binds to a particular antigen (e.g., a high DP polySia), without substantially binding to any other antigen or form of antigen (e.g., a low DP polySia). </p> [00147] As used herein, the term\u201csimultaneous\u201d therapeutic use refers to the </p>administration of at least two active ingredients by the same route and at the same time or at substantially the same time. </p> [00148] As used herein, the term\u201ctherapeutic agent\u201d is intended to mean a compound that, when present in an effective amount, produces a desired therapeutic effect on a subject in need thereof. </p> [00149] \u201cTreating\u201d or\u201ctreatment\u201d as used herein covers the treatment of a disease or disorder described herein, in a subject, such as a human, and includes: (i) inhibiting a disease or disorder, i.e., arresting its development; (ii) relieving a disease or disorder, i.e., causing regression of the disorder; (iii) slowing progression of the disorder; and/or (iv) inhibiting, relieving, or slowing progression of one or more symptoms of the disease or disorder. In some embodiments, treatment means that the symptoms associated with the disease are, e.g., alleviated, reduced, c",
    "es (Rutishauser, U. Nat Rev Neur o ci 9, 26-35 (2008)). High DP polySia shows an inhibitory effect on cellular adhesion (Muhlenhoff, M., et al. Curr Opin Struct Biol 8, 558-564 (1998); Johnson, C. P., et al. JBiol Chem 280, 137-145 (2005)), and is expressed on several metastatic cancers including small cell and non-small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma, pancreatic cancer, pituitary tumors, Wilm\u2019s tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma (Falconer, R. A., et al. Curr Cancer Drug Targets 12, 925-939 (2012)), glioblastoma, (Amoureux, M. C., et al. BMC Cancer 10, 91 (2010)) and in breast cancer (Wang, X., et al. IntJMolMed 37, 197-206 (2016)). The DP of polySia was greater than 55 Sia units in neuroblastoma (Livingston, B. D., et al. J Biol Chem 263, 9443-9448 (1988)). With its wide expression on several tumors types and virtual absence in most adult tissues, polySia is a target for cancer immunotherapy. </p> [00154] Several monoclonal antibodies have been developed against mono- and di-sialic acid (1-2 Sia units), oligo-sialic acid (3-5 units of Sia) and polySia (at least 8 Sia units). See Sato, C., and Kitajima, K. J Biochem 154, 115-136 (2013). Of these only murine mAb735 (Bitter- Suermann, D., and Roth, J. Immunol Res 6, 225-237 (1987)) has been described to have the highest specificity for high DP of PolySia, requiring at least 11 Sia units (Sato, C., and Kitajima, K. J Biochem 154, 115-136 (2013)). Further investigation into the binding kinetics of mAb735 showed high affinity (subnanomolar dissociation constant KD) to polySia with a high DP (-200 Sia units), and progressively weaker affinity to lower degrees of polymerization (Hayrinen, J., et al. Mol Immunol 39, 399-411 (2002)). </p> Immunoglobulin-related Compositions of the Present Technology </p>[00155] The present technology describes methods and compositions for the generation and use of anti-polySia immunoglobulin-related compositions (e.g., anti-polySia antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof). The anti-polySia immunoglobulin-related </p>compositions of the present disclosure may be useful in the diagnosis, or treatment of polySia-associated cancers. Anti-polySia immunoglobulin-related compositions within the scope of the present technology include, e.g., but are not limited to, monoclonal, chimeric, humanized, and diabodies that specifically bind polySia, a homolog, derivative or a fragment thereof. Anti-polySia immunoglobulin-related compositions within the scope of the present technology also include compositions in a bispecific antibody format for enhanced anti-tumor potency (e.g., via T cell recruitment or payload delivery). The present disclosure also \n\n provides antigen binding fragments of any of the anti-polySia antibodies disclosed herein, wherein the antigen binding fragment is selected from the group consisting of Fab, F(ab)'2, Fab\u2019, scFv, and F<sub>v</sub>.

In some embodiments, the antibody or antigen binding fragment binds to high DP polySia, e.g., with a DP&gt;l0, DP&gt;20, DP&gt;50, DP&gt;l00, or DP&gt;200. In some embodiments, the epitope is a conformational epitope that is specific to high DP polySia. In some embodiments, the conformational epitope includes, 3 or more Sia units. In some embodiments, the 3 or more Sia units may be consecutive units </p> [00175] In some embodiments, the HC and LC immunoglobulin variable domain sequences are components of the same polypeptide chain. In other embodiments, the HC and LC immunoglobulin variable domain sequences are components of different polypeptide chains. In certain embodiments, the antibody is a full-length antibody. \n\n [00176] In some embodiments, the immunoglobulin-related compositions of the present technology bind specifically to polySia. In some embodiments, the immunoglobulin-related compositions of the present technology bind high DP polySia with a dissociation constant (KD) of about 1CT<sup>3</sup> M, l(T<sup>4</sup> M, 1(G<sup>5</sup> M, 1(G<sup>6</sup> M, 1(G<sup>7</sup> M, 1(G<sup>8</sup> M, 1(G<sup>9</sup> M, 1(G<sup>10</sup> M, KT<sup>n</sup> M, or lCT<sup>12</sup> M. In certain embodiments, the immunoglobulin-related compositions are monoclonal antibodies, chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, or bispecific antibodies. In some embodiments, the antibodies comprise a human antibody framework region. </p> [00177] In certain embodiments, the immunoglobulin-related composition includes one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the light chain immunoglobulin variable domain sequence is at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or at least 99% identical to the light chain immunoglobulin variable domain sequence present in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 37, 39, 41, 43, 44, 45, 47, 24, 27, 28, 49, 50, 52, 54, 60, 82, 83, or 84; and/or (b) a heavy chain immunoglobulin variable domain sequence that is at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or at least 99% identical to the heavy chain immunoglobulin variable domain sequence present in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 40, 42, 46, 23, 25, 26, 29, 48, 51, 53, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, or 81.

    "s by yeast surface display have been described by Kieke et al, Protein Eng. 1997 Nov; 10(11): 1303-10. \n\n [00259] In some embodiments, anti-polySia antibodies of the present technology are selected using ribosome display. Methods useful for identifying ligands in peptide libraries using ribosome display have been described by Mattheakis el al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91 : 9022-26, 1994; and Hanes et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94: 4937-42, 1997. </p> [00260] After selection of the desired anti-polySia antibodies, it is contemplated that said antibodies can be produced in large volume by any technique known to those skilled in the art, e.g., prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell expression and the like. The anti-polySia antibodies which are, e.g., but not limited to, anti-polySia hybrid antibodies or fragments can be produced by using conventional techniques to construct an expression vector that encodes an antibody heavy chain in which the CDRs and, if necessary, a minimal portion of the variable region framework, that are required to retain original species antibody binding specificity (as engineered according to the techniques described herein) are derived from the originating species antibody and the remainder of the antibody is derived from a target species immunoglobulin which can be manipulated as described herein, thereby producing a vector for the expression of a hybrid antibody heavy chain. </p> [00261] Measurement of polySia Binding. In some embodiments, a polySia binding assay refers to an assay format wherein high DP polySia and an anti-polySia antibody are mixed under conditions suitable for binding between the high DP polySia and the anti-polySia antibody and assessing the amount of binding between the high DP polySia and the anti poly Sia antibody. The amount of binding is compared with a suitable control, which can be the amount of binding in the absence of the high DP polySia, the amount of the binding in the presence of a non-specific immunoglobulin composition, or both. The amount of binding can be assessed by any suitable method. Binding assay methods include, e.g., ELISA, radioimmunoassays, scintillation proximity assays, fluorescence energy transfer assays, liquid chromatography, membrane filtration assays, and the like. Biophysical assays for the direct measurement of high DP polySia binding to anti-polySia antibody are, e.g., nuclear magnetic resonance, fluorescence, fluorescence polarization, surface plasmon resonance (BIACORE chips) and the like. Specific binding is determined by standard assays known in the art, e.g., radioligand binding assays, ELISA, FRET, immunoprecipitation, SPR, NMR (2D-NMR), mass spectroscopy and the like. If the specific binding of a candidate anti- polySia antibody is at least 1 percent greater than the binding observed in the absence of the candidate anti-polySia antibody, the candidate anti-polySia antibody is useful as an anti- polySia antibody of the present technology. \n\n [00262] Measurement of polySia Neutralization. As used here,\u201cpolySia neutralization\u201d refers to reduction of the activity and/or expression of polySia, or the reduction of the activity and/or expression of a protein modified with polySia moieties, through the binding of an anti- polySia antibody. The capacity of anti-polySia antibodies of the present technology to neutralize polySia activity/expression may be assessed in vitro or in vivo using methods known in the art. </p> Uses of the Anti-polvSia Antibodies of the Present Technology </p>[00263] General.
