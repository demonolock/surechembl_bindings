    "ds pulse to -20 mV for 70 msec duration; the effectiveness of the drug in inhibiting the current mediated by the channel is measured directly from measuring the reduction in peak current amplitude initiated by the voltage shift from -80 m V to -20 m V; (2). -100 mV holding potential every 15 seconds pulse to -20 mV for 70 msec duration; the effectiveness of the drug in inhibiting the current mediated by the channel is measured directly from measuring the reduction in peak current amplitude initiated by the shift in potential from -100 m V to -20 m V. The difference in block at the two holding potentials was used to determine the effect of drug at differing levels of inactivation induced by the level of resting state potential of the cells. After obtaining control baseline calcium currents, extracellular solutions containing increasing concentrations of a test compound are washed on. Once steady state inhibition at a given compound concentration is reached, a higher concentration of compound is applied. % inhibition of the peak inward control Ca<sup>2+</sup> current during the depolarizing step to -20 m V is plotted as a function of compound concentration.</p>The intrinsic T -type calcium ion channel antagonist activity of a compound which may be used in the present invention may be determined by these assays. In particular, the compounds of the aforementioned examples had activity in antagonizing the T-type calcium ion channels in the aforementioned assays, generally with an IC50 of less than about 25 \u03bcM. Preferred compounds within the present invention had activity in antagonizing the T-type calcium ion channel in the aforementioned assays with an IC50 of less than about 1 \u03bcM . Such a result is indicative of the intrinsic activity of the compounds in use as antagonists of T-type calcium ion channels activity.</p>T-type calcium ion channels have been implicated in a wide range of biological functions. This has suggested a potential role for these receptors in a variety of disease processes in humans or other species. The compounds of the present invention have utility in treating, preventing, ameliorating, controlling or reducing the risk of a variety of \n\n neurological and psychiatric disorders associated with calcium ion channels, including one or more of the following symptoms, conditions, and/or diseases: movement disorders, including akinesias and akinetic-rigid syndromes (including Parkinson's disease, drug-induced parkinsonism, postencephalitic parkinsonism, progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy, corticobasal degeneration, parkinsonism- ALS dementia complex and basal ganglia calcification), chronic fatigue syndrome, fatigue, including Parkinson's fatigue, multiple sclerosis fatigue, fatigue caused by a sleep disorder or a circadian rhythm disorder, medication-induced parkinsonism (such as neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, neuroleptic-induced acute dystonia, neuroleptic-induced acute akathisia, neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia and medication-induced postural tremor), Gilles de Ia Tourette's syndrome, seizure disorders, epilepsy, and dyskinesias [including tre"
