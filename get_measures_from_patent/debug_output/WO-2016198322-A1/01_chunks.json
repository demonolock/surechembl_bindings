    "nding order. If the number of values in the data set is odd, the median is the middle value. If the number of values in the data set is even, the median is the arithmetic mean of the two middle values. </p>Examples were synthesized one or more times. When synthesized more than once, data from biological assays represent average values or median values calculated utilizing data sets obtained from testing of one or more synthetic batch. </p>Mutant IDH1 R132H biochemical assay mlDH1 catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of alpha-ketoglutarate (a-KG) to (2R)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). NADPH consumption was measured by luminescent readout. \n\n The biochemical reactions were performed at 32 \u00b0C in 384-well plates using a reaction volume of 41 \u03bc\u0399_ and the following assay buffer conditions: 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCI, 20 mM MgC , 0.05% BSA, 0.01 % Brij, 1 \u03bc\u039c NADPH, and 250 \u03bc\u039c \u03b1-KG. The IDH1 R132H enzyme was used in a final concentration of 1.5 nM. Test compounds were used in a concentration range between 0.002 and 10 \u03bc\u039c. The final DMSO concentration was 2.4%. </p> The reaction was incubated for 30 minutes, then 40 \u03bc\u0399_ of detection mix (0.75 \u03bcg ml Luciferase, 0.02 U/ml Oxidoreductase, 4 \u03bcg mL FMN, 2 \u03bc L/ml decanal/ethanol, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.5% Glycerin, 0.01 % Tween-20, 0.05% BSA) was added. Luminescence was measured on a luminescent reader (10 seconds measuring time, 1 second integration period, 30% sensitivity). The decrease in luminescence is proportional to mlDH1 activity. IC50 values are determined by interpolation from plots of relative luminescence versus inhibitor concentration.

Cells (LN229 R132H, Mohrenz et al., Apoptosis (2013) 18:1416-1425) were grown in DMEM containing 10% FCS. They were harvested by trypsin and seeded into 96-well plates. Cells were incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2. The next day test compounds were added to each cell well. The final concentration of DMSO was 0.1 % and DMSO controls were included. The plates were then placed in an incubator for 24 hours. </p> 2-HG was measured according to Balss et al. (Acta Neuropathol (2012) 124: 883- 891 ). Briefly, HCIO4 was added to each well and the plates were centrifuged. Aliquots are removed and incubated with hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (HGDH), diaphorase, NAD+, and resazurin. The conversion of resazurin to resorufin was detected by fluorescence spectroscopy at Ex 540 nm Em 600 nm. The increase in fluorescence is proportional to 2-HG production. IC50 values are determined by interpolation from plots of relative fluorescence vs inhibitor concentration. \n\n Table 7: </p> IC<sub>5</sub>o values of selected examples in mutant IDH1 cellular assay \n<img id=\"imgf000106_0001\" path=\"imgf000106_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/364255862/WO/20161215/A1/002016/19/83/22/imgf000106_0001.tif\"/>\n \n</p>"
