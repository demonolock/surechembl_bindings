    ", San Diego, Calif.). </p> Other molecular modeling techniques may also be employed in accordance with this invention. See, e.g., N. C. Cohen et al., \u201cMolecular Modeling Software and Methods for Medicinal Chemistry, J. Med. Chem., 33, pp. 883-894 (1990). See also, M. A. Navia et al., \u201cThe Use of Structural Information in Drug Design\u201d, Current Opinions in Structural Biology, 2, pp. 202-210 (1992). </p> Once the binding entity has been optimally selected or designed, as described above, substitutions may then be made in some of its atoms or side groups in order to improve or modify its binding properties. Generally, initial substitutions are conservative, i.e., the replacement group will have approximately the same size, shape, hydrophobicity and charge as the original group. It should, of course, be understood that components known in the art to alter conformation should be avoided. Such substituted chemical compounds may then be analyzed for efficiency of fit by the same computer methods described above. </p> Another approach made possible and enabled by this invention, is the computational screening of small molecule databases. In this screening, the quality of fit of such entities to the binding site may be judged either by shape complementarity or by estimated interaction energy. Generally the tighter the fit, the lower the steric hindrances, and the greater the attractive forces, the more potent the potential modulator since these properties are consistent with a tighter binding constant. Furthermore, the more specificity in the design of a potential drug the more likely that the drug will not interact as well with other proteins. This will minimize potential side effects due to unwanted interactions with other proteins. </p> Compounds of interest can be systematically modified by computer modeling programs until one or more promising potential analogs are identified. In addition systematic modification of selected analogs can then be systematically modified by computer modeling programs until one or more potential analogs are identified. Alternatively a potential modulator could be obtained by initially screening a random peptide library, for example one produced by recombinant bacteriophage. A peptide selected in this manner would then be systematically modified by computer modeling programs as described above, and then treated analogously to a structural analog. </p> Once a potential modulator/inhibitor is identified it can be either selected from a library of chemicals as are commercially available from most large chemical companies including Merck, GlaxoWelcome, Bristol Meyers Squib, Monsanto/Searle, Eli Lilly, Novartis and Pharmacia UpJohn, or alternatively the potential modulator may be synthesized de novo. The de novo synthesis of one or even a relatively small group of specific compounds is reasonable in the art of drug design. </p> The success of both database and de novo methods in identifying compounds with activities similar to t",
    "drugs, the functionally relevant portion may be referred to as a pharmacophore, i.e. an arrangement of structural features and functional groups important for biological activity. Not all identified compounds having the desired pharmacophore will act as a modulator of inflammation. The actual activity can be finally determined only by measuring the activity of the compound in relevant biological assays. However, the methods of the invention are extremely valuable because they can be used to greatly reduce the number of compounds that must be tested to identify an actual inhibitor. </p> In order to determine the biological activity of a candidate pharmacophore it is preferable to measure biological activity at several concentrations of candidate compound. The activity at a given concentration of candidate compound can be tested in a number of ways. </p> For example, an HLA molecule can be attached to a solid support. Methods for placing proteins on a solid support are well known in the art and include such steps as linking biotin to the protein, and linking avidin to the solid support. The solid support can be washed to remove unreacted species. A solution of a labeled candidate agent can be contacted with the solid support. The solid support is washed again to remove the potential modulator not bound to the support. The amount of labeled potential modulator remaining with the solid support and thereby bound to the protein can be determined. Alternatively, or in addition, the dissociation constant between the labeled candidate agent and the protein can be determined. </p> Crystals of the binding complex of the present invention can be grown by a number of techniques including batch crystallization, vapor diffusion (either by sitting drop or hanging drop) and by microdialysis. Seeding of the crystals in some instances is required to obtain X-ray quality crystals. Standard micro and/or macro seeding of crystals may therefore be used. The crystals may be shrunk by transfer into solutions of different composition, e.g. by the addition of metal ions such as Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Pb<sup>2+</sup>, etc. Crystals may also be generated that include cofactors, substrates, candidate inhibitors, and the like, that interact with the protein, e.g. by cocrystallization of soaking protein crystals in a solution comprising an inhibitor or other agent. </p> Alternative methods may also be used. For example, crystals can be characterized by using X-rays produced in a conventional source (such as a sealed tube or a rotating anode) or using a synchrotron source. Methods of characterization include, but are not limited to, precision photography, oscillation photography and diffractometer data collection. Selenium-methionine may be used as described in the examples provided herein, or alternatively a heavy metal derivative data set (e.g., using PCMB) may be used in place of the selenium-methionine derivatization. </p> Electron density maps may be built from crystals using pha"
