    " T lymphocyte; and (d) the ability to inhibit proliferation of an activated T lymphocyte. These properties are described further throughout the present disclosure. Antibodies of the present invention can also be described or specified in terms of their cross-reactivity. Antibodies that do not bind any other analog, ortholog, or homologue of a P2Y10 polypeptide of the present invention are included in the scope of the present invention. Antibodies that bind a P2Y10 polypeptide (e.g., sSEQ ID NO:2) with at least 95%, at least 90%, at least 85%, at least 80%, at least 75%, at least 70%, at least 65%, at least 60%, at least 55%, and at least 50% identity (as calculated using methods known in the art and/or as described herein) or to a P2Y10 polypeptide or fragment (e.g., SEQ ID NOs:3 and 4) are also encompassed by the present invention. In specific embodiments, antibodies of the present invention cross-react with murine, rat and/or rabbit homologues of human proteins and the corresponding epitopes thereof.</p>In a specific embodiment, the above-described cross-reactivity is with respect to any single specific antigenic or immunogenic P2Y10 polypeptide, or combination(s) of 2, 3, 4, 5, or more of the specific antigenic and/or immunogenic P2Y10 polypeptides disclosed herein. Antibodies of the present invention can also be described or specified in terms of their binding affinity to a P2Y10 polypeptide of the present invention. Representative binding affinities include those with a dissociation constant or Kd less than 5 X 10<sup>\"2</sup> M, 10<sup>\"2</sup> M, 5 X 10<sup>\"3</sup> M, 10<sup>\"3</sup> M, 5 X 10<sup>\"4</sup> M, 10<sup>\"4</sup> M, \n\n 5 X 10<sup>\"5</sup> M, 1 X 10<sup>-5</sup> M, 5 X 10<sup>\"6</sup> M, 1 X 10<sup>\"6</sup> M, 5 X 10<sup>\"7</sup> M, 1 X 10<sup>\"7</sup> M, 5 X 10<sup>\"8</sup> M, 1 X 10<sup>\"8</sup> M, 5 X 10<sup>\"9</sup> M, 1 X 10<sup>\"9</sup> M, 5 X 10 <sup>0</sup> M, 1 X 10<sup>\"10</sup> M, 5 X 10 <sup>1</sup> M, 1 X 10<sup>\"11</sup> M, 5 X 10<sup>\"12</sup> M, 10<sup>\"12</sup> M, 5 X 10<sup>\"13</sup> M, 1 X 10<sup>\"13</sup> M, 5 X 10<sup>\"14</sup> M, 1 X 10<sup>\"14</sup> M, 5 X 10<sup>\"</sup> <sup> 15</sup> M, or 1 X 10<sup>\"15</sup> M. The present invention also provides antibodies that competitively inhibit binding of a ligand to an epitope of the present invention as determined by any method known in the art for determining competitive binding, for example, the immunoassays described herein. In representative embodiments, the antibody competitively inhibits binding to the epitope by at least 95%, at least 90%, at least 85 %, at least 80%, at least 75%, at least 70%, at least 60%, or at least 50%.</p>An antibody of the present invention includes derivatives that are modified, i.e., by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule to the antibody such that covalent attachment does not prevent the antibody from generating an anti-idiotypic response. For example, but not by way of limitation, an antibody derivative includes antibodies that have been ",
    "e culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (\"HAT medium\"), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.</p>In some embodiments, preferred immortalized cell lines are those that fuse ' efficiently, support stable high level expression of antibody by the selected antibody- producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. Other useful immortalized cell lines are murine myeloma lines, which can be obtained, for \n\ninstance, from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, California, USA and the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Virginia, USA. Yet other useful immortalized cell lines are the parent myeloma cell lines as provided by the ATCC. As noted and implied throughout the specification, human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (see, e.g., Kozbor, (1984) /. Immunol. 133:3001; Brodeur et al\u201e Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, New York, USA (1987) pp. 51-63).</p>The culture medium in which the hybridoma cells are cultured can then be assayed for the presence of monoclonal antibodies directed against a P2Y10 polypeptide or a fragment thereof (such as P2Y10 residues 171-191). The binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by the hybridoma cells can be determined, for example by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assay (ELISA). Such techniques are known in the art. The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by a Scatchard analysis (see Munson &amp; Pollart. (1980) Anal. Biochem. 107:220.</p>After the desired hybridoma cells are identified, the clones can be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (see, e.g., Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, Academic Press, New York, New York, USA (1986) and/or Wands et al.. (1981) Gastroenterology 80:225-232). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium and RPMI-1640. Alternatively, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites in a mammal. The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones can be isolated or purified from the culture medium or ascites fluid by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-sepharose, hydroxyapatite chromatography, gel exclusion chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography, all of which techniques will be known to those of ordinary skill in the art. \n\n VII. Representative Applications The modulators of the present invention, particularly a modulator comprising an anti-P2Y10 antibody, can be used in a variety of applications. A representative, but non-limiting, list of applications for modulators of the present invention includ",
    "hose that measure T lymphocyte proliferation, are known in the art (see, e.g., Ledbetter et aL, (1990) Blood 75:1531-39; Siefken et al.. (1997) Cell. Immunol. 176:59-65). When a modulator is an anti-P2Y10 antibody, association of an anti-P2Y10 antibody with a P2Y10 polypeptide is a natural result of exposing one to another, although such a binding event can be verified, if desired, using binding assays known in the art. The resting T lymphocyte can be isolated or can be a member of a population of PBMC's. Methods of preparing PBMC's from blood are known (e.g., by density gradient cetrifugation).</p>Another property a modulator can have is the ability to induce expression of a P2Y10 polypeptide on the surface of a resting T lymphocyte upon association with a P2Y10 polypeptide. Expression of a P2Y10 polypeptide on the surface of a T lymphocyte can be detected as described herein, for example by FACS-based \n\ntechniques. An assessment of P2Y10 expression can be made, for example, by performing a FACS analysis of a resting T lymphocyte population to determine an amount of expressed P2Y10, followed by a FACS analysis of the population of T lymphocytes after exposure to an anti-P2Y10 antibody. Yet another property a modulator can have is the ability to stimulate expression of mRNA encoding a P2Y10 polypeptide in a resting T lymphocyte upon association with a P2Y10 polypeptide. Expression of mRNA encoding a P2Y10 polypeptide can be quantitated in any way, for example, by employing a binding assay or by employing a labeled anti-P2Y10 antibody of the present invention. A further property a modulator can have is the ability to inhibit proliferation of an activated T lymphocyte upon association with a P2Y10 polypeptide. A T lymphocyte can be activated in any way, for example by exposing the T lymphocyte to phorbol ester, anti-CD3 antibodies, anti-CD28 antibodies or a combination of anti- CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies, as described herein. T lymphocyte proliferation can be conveniently measured by employing a tritium-labled thymidine incorporation assay, such as that described herein.</p>A modulator of the present invention can have one or a combination of two or more of the properties discussed above.</p>As noted herein, modulation can be performed in vivo or in vitro. Representative systems for both in vivo and in vitro modulation protocols are provided herein.</p>N\u03c0.E. Modulation of a Biological Activity A modulator of the present invention, such as an anti-P2Y10 antibody of the present invention, can be employed to modulate a biological activity. The term \"biological activity\" includes any activity induced, mediated or inhibited by P2Y10 binding, for example, T lymphocyte activation and/or proliferation, and upregulation and/or downregulation of an immune response. Modulation of a biological activity can be achieved by employing an anti-P2Y10 antibody alone, in combination with one or more additional therapeutics or drug moieties, or as a conjugate compris",
    "ATCA (forward; SEQ ID NO:5) and CATTGATGAACCACTCTCCT (reverse; SEQ ID NO:6). The amplicon resulting from the RT-PCR using these primers corresponds to nucleotides 759-1011 (253 bp) of P2Y10. For GAPDH, the following primers were used:</p>TTAGCACCCCTGGCCAAGG (forward; SEQ ID NO:7) and CTTACTCCTTGGAGGCCATG (reverse; SEQ ID NO: 8).</p>Detection of Surface Expression ofP2Y10 on T cells by FACS Analysis</p>Cells were washed with PBS containing FBS (FACS buffer) and then stained by adding anti-P2Y10 mAb (1:100 dilution in FACS buffer) for 30 min on ice. Cells were washed twice with cold FACS buffer followed by addition of mouse anti-rat IgG-FLTC (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, Pennsylvania, USA, Cat # 212- , 096-104) as secondary staining (1:200 dilution) and co-stained with anti-hCD4-PE (Becton Dickinson, 347327, 1:200 dilution), or anti-hCD8-PE (Becton Dickinson, Palo Alto, California, USA, Cat # 340046, 1:200 dilution) for 15 mins. After washing twice with cold FACS buffer, cells were resuspended in 0.4ml cold FACS buffer. FACS analysis performed on a FACSort (Becton Dickinson, Palo Alto, California, USA). \n\n Results and Discussion of Example 1 Using the peptide corresponding to amino acids 171-191 of P2Y10 as antigen, a rat anti-P2Y10 monoclonal antibody was identified and isolated. The anti-P2Y10 rat hybridoma has been deposited to the ATCC Patent Depository (No. PTA-3975, January 11, 2001).</p>The anti-P2Y10 mAb is specific in that it only recognizes a single band of 40 kD molecular weight on Western blots of B cell lysates corresponding to the predicted MW for P2Y10 (see Figure 1).</p>Using the anti-P2Y10 mAb, the effect of T cell activation on the surface expression of P2Y10 was investigated by FACS analysis. As shown in Table 1, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells showed pronounced increases in P2Y10 surface expression when stimulated with either anti-CD-3 alone or anti-CD-3/anti-CD-28 co-stimulation. Phorbol ester (PMA) stimulation also induced P2Y10 surface expression, but to a smaller extent. Surface expression of P2Y10 concomitant with stimulation of T cells suggests a role of P2Y10 in activated T cells. An additional interesting observation was obtained in T cells incubated with the anti-P2Y10 mAb, with the antibody itself appearing to stimulate its own surface expression.</p>Consistent with these findings, RT-PCR analysis of the amount of mRNA encoding P2Y10 that was induced in T cells stimulated by either phorbol ester, anti- CD3, or anti-CD3/CD28 (see Figure 2, GAPDH levels are shown as a control for the amount of mRNA). Little message was detected in unstimulated cells. Treatment of the cells with anti-P2Y10 mAb also stimulated P2Y10 mRNA levels. These findings indicate that the stimulation of surface expression of P2Y10 results from stimulation of mRNA encoding P2Y10. Since P2Y10 expression is coincident with activation and stimulation of T cells, the effect of anti-P2Y10 mAb on T cell proliferation was investigated. As shown in Table 2,"
