    " blood pressure, glucose intolerance, and hypercalcemia.</p>Other agents useful for the treatment of hyperlipidemia include ezetimibe (Zetia\u00ae; Merck), which blocks or inhibits cholesterol absorption. However, inhibitors of ezetimibe have been shown to exhibit certain toxicities.</p>HDL, as well as recombinant forms of ApoA-I complexed with phospholipids can serve as sinks/scavengers for apolar or amphipathic molecules, e.g., cholesterol and derivatives (oxysterols, oxidized sterols, plant sterols, etc.), cholesterol esters, phospholipids and derivatives (oxidized phospholipids), triglycerides, oxidation products, and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (see, e.g., Casas et al., 1995, J. Surg. Res. Nov 59(5):544-52). HDL can also serve as also a scavenger for TNF-alpha and other lymphokines HDL can also serve as a carrier for human serum paraoxonases, e.g., PON-1, -2, -3. Paraoxonase, an esterase associated with HDL, is important for protecting cell components against oxidation. Oxidation of LDL, which occurs during oxidative stress, appears directly linked to development of atherosclerosis (Aviram, 2000, Free Radic. Res. 33 Suppl:S85-97). Paraoxonase appears to play a role in susceptibility to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (Aviram, 1999, Mol. Med. Today 5(9):381-86). Human serum paraoxonase (PON-1) is bound to high-density lipoproteins (HDLs). Its activity is inversely related to atherosclerosis. PON-1 hydrolyzes organophosphates and may protect against atherosclerosis by inhibition of the oxidation of HDL and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (Aviram, 1999, Mol. Med. Today 5(9):381-86). Experimental studies suggest that this protection is associated with the ability of PON-1 to hydrolyze specific lipid peroxides in oxidized lipoproteins. Interventions that preserve or enhance PON-1 activity may help to delay the onset of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease.</p>HDL further has a role as an antithrombotic agent and fibrinogen reducer, and as an agent in hemorrhagic shock (Cockerill et al., WO 01/13939, published Mar. 1, 2001). HDL, and ApoA-I in particular, has been show to facilitate an exchange of lipopolysaccharide produced by sepsis into lipid particles comprising ApoA-I, resulting in the functional neutralization of the lipopolysaccharide (Wright et al., WO9534289, published Dec. 21, 1995; Wright et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,928,624 issued Jul. 27, 1999; Wright et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,932,536, issued Aug. 3, 1999).</p>There are a variety of methods available for making lipoprotein complexes in vitro. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,287,590 and 6,455,088 disclose a method entailing co-lyophilization of apolipoprotein and lipid solutions in organic solvent (or solvent mixtures) and formation of charged lipoprotein complexes during hydration of the lyophilized powder. Lipoprotein complexes can also be formed by a detergent dialysis method; e.g., a mixture of a lipid, a lipoprotein and a detergent such as cholate is dialyzed and reconstituted to form a complex",
    "bitors (e.g., anacetrapib and dalcetrapib), and/or PCSKG antibodies or ligands.</p>5. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURESFIG. 1: the amino acid sequence of human prepro-Apolipoprotein A-I (SEQ ID NO: 1; GenBank Accession no. AAB59514.1). Amino acids 1-18, in bold font, correspond to the signal sequence of ApoA-I, and amino acids 19-24 correspond to the propeptide sequence, underlined. Both the signal sequence and the propeptide are cleaved in cells to produce the full-length mature human ApoA-I (amino acids 25-267).</p>FIG. 2: ApoA-I titers in 12-day fed batch cultures of recombinant S-CHO cells expressing ApoA-I. Cells were continuously cultured by serial passage from generation 0 to generation 43. The ApoA-I production was monitored in generations 4, 8, 14, 19, 25, 21, 36 and 43 by reverse phase HPLC. The amount of ApoA-I in the culture medium varied from 1259 mg/L to 1400 mg/L.</p>FIGS. 3A-3B: FIG. 3A shows the viable cell density in a 200 L 13-day culture of recombinant S-CHO cells expressing ApoA-I.

The concentration of ApoA-I in the culture medium peaked on day 12 at around 2 mg/mL.</p>FIG. 4: SDS polyacrylamide gel of ApoA-I purified by the methods described herein.
