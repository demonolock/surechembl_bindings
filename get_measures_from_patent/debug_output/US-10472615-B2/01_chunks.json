    "ions within GALNS have been modified to present GALNS enzymes with reduced immunogenicity and without an effective reduction in enzyme activity. The inventors believe that this method may also be applied to other enzymes used in ERT, practically those used to treat lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs).</p>Identification of Immunodominant Peptides and Evaluation of ModificationsThe inventors have identified immunodominant peptides of GALNS using bioinformatics tools in combination with target enzyme deficient animals, and in vitro and in vivo humoral and cellular assays for immune response indicators, as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/760,907.</p>More specifically, the initial identification of potential immunodominant peptides, was done using bioinformatic tools, RANKPEP (Reche et al. (2002) Human Immunology, 63: 701-709.; Reche et al. (2004) Immunogenetics, 56:405-419; Reche and Reinherz (2007) Methods Mol Biol., 409:185-200) and Immune Epitope Data Base (Vita et.al., (2010) Nucleic Acids Res. 2010 ;38:D854-62). GALNS immunogenicity and prediction of B-cell epitopes were evaluated by the Immune Epitope Data Base (IEDB) analysis resource. The algorithm is based on the predictions of surface accessibility and flexibility of the molecule, and the presence of \u03b2-turns and linear epitopes (Zhang et al. (2008) (IEDB-AR). Nucleic Acids Res. 2008: p. W513-8). MHC-II epitopes (H2-IAb) were predicted by IEDB and RANKPEP. Ten peptides were selected by the best scores of IC50 nM (concentration of peptide that inhibits binding of a standard peptide by 50%) and binding potential, respectively (Kim, et al. (2011) J. Immunol. Methods, 374(1-2): p. 62-9).</p>Of 10 peptides identified by bioinformatics techniques, 3 indicated an increased immunodominant response relative to the 7 remaining peptides, and compared to the intact enzyme (see FIG. 1). This selection was done using immunizing enzyme deficient MKC mice (see U.S. Pat application no. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/760,907). The Inventors chose three immunodominant peptide regions, designated C4, E8, and I10, within the GALNS protein as targets for modification to produce GALNS enzymes with reduced immunogenicity.</p>The Inventors reasoned that reduced immunogenicity of GALNS may be accomplished by substituting certain amino acid residues within these immunodominant regions. The inventors also reasoned that the tertiary structure of the GALNS protein was an essential consideration when bioengineering GALNS variants, because protein miss-folding is known to be the most common cause of enzyme deficiency in Morquio A disease.<sup>2 </sup></p>GALNS is a homodimeric glycoprotein with 3 domains in each monomer including an N-terminal domain with the active site, a second domain with antiparallel n-strands, and a C-terminal meander.<sup>2 </sup>Each monomer also contains 3 disulfide bonds, 1 unpaired cysteine, many phosphorylation sites, and 2 N-glycosylation sites at Asn 204 and Asn423<sup>2<"
