    "ly, intermittently, and/or at a lower dose than when the agents are used for treating cancer other diseases.</p>Senolytic AgentsA senolytic agent as used herein is an agent that \u201cselectively\u201d (preferentially or to a greater degree) destroys, kills, removes, or facilitates selective destruction of senescent cells. In other words, the senolytic agent destroys or kills a senescent cell in a biologically, clinically, and/or statistically significant manner compared with its capability to destroy or kill a non-senescent cell. A senolytic agent is used in an amount and for a time sufficient that selectively kills established senescent cells but is insufficient to kill (destroy, cause the death of) a non-senescent cell in a clinically significant or biologically significant manner. In certain embodiments, the senolytic agents described herein alter at least one signaling pathway in a manner that induces (initiates, stimulates, triggers, activates, promotes) and results in (i.e., causes, leads to) death of the senescent cell. The senolytic agent may alter, for example, either or both of a cell survival signaling pathway (e.g., Akt pathway) or an inflammatory pathway, for example, by antagonizing a protein within the cell survival and/or inflammatory pathway in a senescent cell.</p>Without wishing to be bound by a particular theory, the mechanism by which the inhibitors and antagonists described herein selectively kill senescent cells is by inducing (activating, stimulating, removing inhibition of) an apoptotic pathway that leads to cell death. Non-senescent cells may be proliferating cells or may be quiescent cells. In certain instances, exposure of non-senescent cells to the senolytic agent as used in the methods described herein may temporarily reduce the capability of non-senescent cell to proliferate; however, an apoptotic pathway is not induced and the non-senescent cell is not destroyed.</p>Certain senolytic agents that may be used in the methods described herein have been described as useful for treating a cancer; however, in the methods for treating a senescence associated disorder or disease, the senolytic agents are administered in a manner that would be considered different and likely ineffective for treating a cancer. The method used for treating a senescence associated disease or disorder with a senolytic agent described herein may comprise one or more of a decreased daily dose, decreased cumulative dose over a single treatment cycle, or decreased cumulative dose of the agent from multiple treatment cycles than the dose of an agent required for cancer therapy; therefore, the likelihood is decreased that one or more adverse effects (i.e., side effects) will occur, which adverse effects are associated with treating a subject according to a regimen optimized for treating a cancer. In contrast, as a senolytic agent, the compounds described herein may be administered at a lower dose than presently described in the art or in a manner that selectiv",
    "over a BCL-w protein or nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, a BCL-xL selective inhibitor exhibits at least a 5-fold, 10-fold, 50-fold, 100-fold, 1000-fold, 10000-fold, 20000-fold, or 30000-fold selectivity for binding a BCL-XL protein or nucleic acid over a BCL-B protein or nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, a BCL-XL selective inhibitor exhibits at least a 5-fold, 10-fold, 50-fold, 100-fold, 1000-fold, 10000-fold, 20000-fold, or 30000-fold selectivity for binding a BCL-xL protein or nucleic acid over an Al protein or nucleic acid. As described herein, in certain embodiments, an inhibitor of one or more BCL-2 anti-apoptotic protein family members wherein the inhibitor inhibits at least BCL-xL (e.g., a BCL-xL selective inhibitor) has no detectable binding to MCL-1 or to BCL2A1.</p>Methods for measuring binding affinity of a BCL-xL inhibitor for BCL-2 family proteins are known in the art. By way of example, binding affinity of a BCL-xL inhibitor may be determined using a competition fluorescence polarization assay in which a fluorescent BAK BH3 domain peptide is incubated with BCL-xL protein (or other BCL-2 family protein) in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of the BCL-XL inhibitor as previously described (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Publication 20140005190; Park et al., Cancer Res. 73:5485-96 (2013); Wang et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 97:7124-9 (2000); Zhang et al., Anal. Biochem. 307:70-5 (2002); Bruncko et al., J. Med. Chem. 50:641-62 (2007)). Percent inhibition may be determined by the equation: 1\u2212[(mP value of well\u2212negative control)/range)]\u00d7100%. Inhibitory constant (K<sub>i</sub>) value is determined by the formula: K<sub>i</sub>=[I]<sub>50</sub>/([L]<sub>50</sub>/K<sub>d</sub>+[P]<sub>0</sub>/K<sub>d</sub>+1) as described in Bruncko et al., J. Med. Chem. 50:641-62 (2007) (see, also, Wang, FEBS Lett. 360:111-114 (1995)).</p>Agents (e.g., BCL-xL selective inhibitors, BCL-xL/BCL-2 inhibitors, BCL-xL/BCL-2/BCL-w inhibitors, BCL-xL/BCL-w inhibitors) used in the methods described herein that selectively kill senescent cells include, by way of example, a small molecule.</p>In particular embodiments, the BCL-xL inhibitor is a small molecule compound that belongs to any one of the following classes of compounds, for example, a benzothiazole-hydrazone compound, aminopyridine compound, benzimidazole compound, tetrahydroquinoline compound, and phenoxyl compound and related analogs.</p>In one embodiment, a BCL-xL selective inhibitor useful for the methods described herein is a benzothiazole-hydrazone small molecule inhibitor. Benzothiazole-hydrazone compounds include WEHI-539 (5-[3-[4-(aminomethyl)phenoxy]propyl]-2-[(8E)-8-(1,3-benzothiazol-2-ylhydrazinylidene)-6,7-dihydro-5H-naphthalen-2-yl]-1,3-thiazole-4-carboxylic acid), a BH3 peptide mimetic that selectively targets BCL-xL (see, e.g., Lessene et al., Nature Chemical Biology 9:390-397 (2013)). In certain embodiments, the methods described herein comprise use of WEHI-539 for sel",
    "g from 1.4 nM to 9 \u03bcM (FIG. 28).</p>As shown in FIGS. 26-27, ABT-199 had an 1050 value of 6 \u03bcM-15.8 \u03bcM in non-senescent cells compared to an 1050 value of 6.9 \u03bcM-12.4 \u03bcM in senescent cells. As shown in FIG. 28, Obatoclax had an 1050 value of 75 nM in non-senescent cells compared to an 1050 value of 125 nM in senescent cells. FIG. 26-28 demonstrate the inability of ABT-199 and Obatoclax to selectively target senescent cells over non-senescent cells.</p>A compound specific for Bcl-2A1 also did not selectively kill senescent cells. IMR90 cells were induced to senescence by irradiation as described in Example 7. The irradiated IMR90 cells and non-senescent IMR90 cells were then exposed to a compound called ML214 that is a Bcl-2A1 specific inhibitor. The level of killing of senescent cells was comparable to the level of killing of non-senescent cells.</p>Example 10Selective Toxicity for Senescent Cells of the AKT Inhibitor, MK-2206 Alone and in Combination with ABT-263The effect of ABT-263 in combination with the Akt inhibitor MK-2206 was tested for selective toxicity of senescent cells compared to non-senescent cells in IMR90 cells. The methods of Example 7 were repeated except that cell cultures were exposed to 10 nM MK-2206 (Selleckem, Cat# S1078) in addition to serial dilutions of ABT-263.</p>FIG. 29A shows the dose dependence plots of ABT-263 treatment in combination with 10 nM MK-2206 on senescent cells and non-senescent cells. ABT-263+MK-2206-treated senescent cells had an IC50 value of 0.083 \u03bcM, whereas ABT-263+MK-2206 cells in non-senescent cells had an IC50 value &gt;3 \u03bcM, yielding a selectivity index of &gt;36 for senescent cells.</p>The senolytic effect of MK-2206 alone was determined by exposing senescent IMR90 cells and non-senescent IMR90 cells (see procedures in Example 7) and to serial dilutions of MK-2206. The percent survival was determined, and the results are present in FIG. 29B.</p>Example 11An Animal Study for Determining the Senolytic Effect of ABT-263 in MiceThe senolytic effect of senolytic agents, e.g., ABT-263, can be assessed in animal models of senescence. An example of such an animal study is described here. Senescence in animals can be induced through the administration of doxorubicin followed by treatment of a senolytic agent. On day 35, mice are sacrificed, and fat and skin are collected for RNA analysis, while lungs are collected and flash frozen for immunomicroscopy analysis. RNA is analyzed for expression of SASP factors (mmp3, IL-6) and senescence markers (p21, p16, and p53). Frozen lung tissue is analyzed for DNA damage marker (\u03b3H2AX).</p>The mice to be tested contain a transgene insertion of p16-3MR. 3MR (tri-modality reporter) is a fusion protein containing functional domains of a synthetic Renilla luciferase (LUC), monomeric red fluorescence protein (mRFP), and truncated herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 thymidine kinase (tTK), which allows killing by ganciclovir (GCV). The 3MR cDNA is inserted in frame with p16 in exon 2, creating a fusion protein containing the first 62 amino acids of p16, but d"
