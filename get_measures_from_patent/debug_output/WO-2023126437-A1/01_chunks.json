Inhaled agonists of soluble guanylate cyclase induce selective pulmonary vasodilation. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2007; 176: 1138- 1145). Both classes of compounds directly bind to sGC as allosteric modulators. sGC stimulators have a dual mode of action, directly stimulating the native sGC independently of NO and also sensitizing sGC to low levels of NO by stabilizing NO-sGC binding. In contrast, sGC activators bind to the unoccupied heme-binding domain, thereby mimicking NO-bound heme, and activate the pathologically changed, NO- unresponsive apo-sGC. Recent evidence has shown that oxidative stress associated with many cardiopulmonary diseases shifts intracellular levels of native sGC toward the apo-sGC form ( Evgenov OV, Pacher P, Schmidt PM, Hasko G, Schmidt HH, Stasch JP.

The saphenous artery was removed and divided into rings 3 mm wide. The rings were mounted singly on in each case a pair of triangular hooks open at the end and made of 0.3 mm -thick special wire (Remanium\u00ae). Each ring was placed under an initial tension in 5 ml organ baths with Krebs- Henseleit solution which was at 37\u00b0C, was gassed with carbogen and had the following composition: NaCl 119 mM; KC1 4.8 mM; CaCl<sub>2</sub> x 2 H<sub>2</sub>O 1 mM; MgSO<sub>4</sub> x 7 H<sub>2</sub>O 1.4 mM; KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.2 mM; NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 25 mM; glucose 10 mM; bovine serum albumin 0.001%. The force of contraction was detected with Statham \n<!-- EPO <DP n=\"186\"/>-->\nUC2 cells, amplified and digitized via A/D converters (DAS -1802 HC, Keithley Instruments, Munich) and recorded in parallel on chart recorders. Contractions were induced by addition of phenylephrine. </p><p id=\"p1026\" num=\"1026\">After several (generally 4) control cycles, the substance to be investigated was added in each further run in increasing dosage, and the level of the contraction achieved under the influence of the test substance was compared with the level of the contraction reached in the last preceding run. The concentration necessary to reduce the contraction reached in the preceding control by 50% was calculated from this (IC50). The standard application volume was 5 pl. The proportion of DMSO in the bath solution corresponded to 0. 1%. </p><p id=\"p1027\" num=\"1027\">Table Cl.1.1: Effects on % contraction of comparative example 11 in comparison to comparative example 1 (Cinaciguat) in ascending concentrations on PE-induced contraction of rabbit saphenous artery (incubation time 0.5 h vs. 2.5 h) .Data are presented as mean +/- SEM (number) \n<img id=\"imgf000186_0001\" path=\"imgf000186_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/1077424306/WO/20230706/A1/002023/12/64/37/imgf000186_0001.tif\"/>\n </p><p id=\"p1028\" num=\"1028\">Compared to comparative example 1 (Cinaciguat), comparative example 11 inhibited concentration dependently phenylephrine induced contractions of rabbit saphenous artery rings with an IC50 values of 911 nM (Cinaciguat IC50 value of 17 nM) 30 min after incubation (see figures 45a and 45b). After a longer preincubation period of 2.5 h, comparative example 11 was even more potent (IC50 value of 0.8 nM) \n<!-- EPO <DP n=\"187\"/>-->\ncompared to Cinaciguat (IC50 value of 3 nM). These results indicate a slower penetration of the saphenous artery by comparative example 11 compared to Cinaciguat. This would be indicative for minimization of unwanted systemic side effects, like e.g. systemic blood pressure decrease compared to the intended local vasodilatory effect in the lung which needs to be as potent as possible. </p><p id=\"p1029\" num=\"1029\">C-1.2. Isolated perfused heart according to Langendorff </p><p id=\"p1030\" num=\"1030\">Male Wistar rats (strain HsdCpb:WU) with a body weight of 200-250 g were anaesthetized with Narcoren\u00ae (100 mg/kg). The thorax was opened and the heart was then exposed, excised and connected to a Langendorff apparatus by placing a cannula into the aorta. The heart was perfused retrogradely at 9 ml/min at constant flow with a Krebs-Henseleit buffer solution (gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2, pH 7.4, 35\u00b0C; composition in mmol/1: NaCl 118; KC1 3; NaHCCL 22; KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.2; MgSO<sub>4</sub> 1.2; CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1.8; Glucose 10; Na pyruvate 2). A pressure transducer registered the perfusion pressure in the perfusion system. The left ventricular pressure (LVP) was measured using a second pressure transducer connected to a water-filled balloon which was inserted into the left ventricle via the left atrium. The end diastolic pressure was initially set to 8 mm Hg by adjusting the volume of the balloon. The hearts were spontaneously beating. The signals from the pressure transducer were amplified, regi"
