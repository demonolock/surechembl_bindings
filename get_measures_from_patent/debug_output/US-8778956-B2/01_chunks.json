    ") of OPTI-MEM I Reduced Serum Medium (Life Technologies Cat. # 51985-034). For each well transfected, 2 \u03bcl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (LF2000) was diluted into 50 \u03bcl (total volume) of OPTI-MEM I medium and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. The diluted DNA and LF2000 were combined and incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes. The growth medium was aspirated from each well and replaced with 1 ml of OPTI-MEM I. A total of 100 \u03bcl of the DNA-LF2000 complexes were added to each well and mixed with gentle swirling. The plate was incubated at 37\u00b0 C., 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>for 5 hours. The OPTI-MEM I medium was aspirated from each transfected well and replaced with 1 ml growth medium. The plate was returned to the incubator for 24 hours. The wells were trypsinized and cells added to 100 mm tissue culture dishes (2 dishes per well). The dishes were incubated for 24 hours. The medium was aspirated from each dish and replaced with growth medium containing 400 \u03bcg/ml Geneticin (G418) selective antibiotic. The plates were refer every 3-4 days.</p>Distinct colonies appeared in approximately 3 weeks. One week later, 48 out of approximately 100 colonies per dish were subcultures to 1 well each of two 24 well plates containing 1 ml of selective medium per well.</p>Confluent wells were expanded to 6 well plates, then T25 flasks and T75 flasks. Cell lines showing poor growth patterns were eliminated. Membranes were prepared from each cell line and receptor activity determined by a receptor binding assay.</p>EXAMPLE 67Method for measuring affinity for the ORL-1 receptorThe nociceptin receptor binding assay measures the binding of <sup>125</sup>I-Tyr<sup>14</sup>-nociceptin (2200 Ci/mmol, New England Nuclear) to human nociceptin receptor (ORL-1) on HEK293 cell membranes.</p>HEK293 cell membrane (prepared as described in Pulito, V. L. et al., 2000, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 294, 224-229), with the exception that the buffer used was a mixture of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH7.8, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>and 1 mM EGTA), was added to PEI treated WGA FlashPlates (New England Nuclear) at 1 \u03bcg/well in binding buffer of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>and 1 mM EGTA. <sup>125</sup>I-Tyr<sup>14</sup>-nociceptin was added at a final concentration of 0.5 nM and the volume adjusted to 50 \u03bcl with binding buffer. The plate was incubated for two hours at room temperature, the reactions were aspirated and the wells washed two times with 200 \u03bcl binding buffer and then filled with 200 \u03bcl binding buffer. The plates were then sealed and counted on a Packard Top Count to determine radioactivity bound to the membranes.</p>For each test compound, the total binding (% Inh) was measured at several concentrations and the IC<sub>50 </sub>(the concentration at which 50% of the binding is inhibited) was determined from the graphical display of X=logarithm of concentration versus Y=response, using the following calculation:</p>Y=(Minimum)+(Maximum-Minimum)(1+10log(EC50\u2062-\u2062X))</p>For some of the test compound, Ki was determined, using the following calculation:</p>Ki values were calculated using Graphpad Prizm software, where\n\nKi=(IC<sub>50</sub>)/(+[radioligand]/Kd)\n</p>For the ORL-1 binding, the Kd was 0.5 nM. The [radioligand] used was the same as the Kd.</p>The ability of representative compounds of the present invention to bind to the ORL-1 receptor in a HEK cell line using a radio-labelled nociceptin as the displaceable ligand was determine according to the procedure described above with results as listed in Table 12. (Note that for the compounds which were tested more than once, the value listed in Table 12 is the calculated mean.)</p>TABLE 12ID#ORL-1 IC<sub>50 </sub>(nM)ORL-1 Ki (nM)18.1028.493173.043.63520.164.66713.484.869233.01010.51122.31221.01310.61425.21531.816122.01710.81810.31915.02015.8219.222220.72380.52434.82533.02620.32711.0287.7429121.03023.23144.53213.73395.33426.93530.3368.73388.8839149.0409.40418.324219.24319.94443.1456.454616.2470.86481.284914.850298.051259.0520.48530.47543.03552.75564.705720.058476.05994.560396.0611.09620.786319.26433.96588.56639.26712.26810.46920.57072.97159.37282.67314.0748.087521.17616.17818.07918.21004.101011.79102199.010318.51040.7210581.610655.410757.710836.911045.011125.211218.011327.411415.111514.011617.011799.71192.812139.912232.412361.212441.612544.112638.612761.012838.6129160.013048.813117.013233.9133108.0134329.013517.31361330.0137101.013831.9139139.0140108.014126.014249.914339.714440.014512.814685.614734.314881.114940.915028.515110.915237.615360.41546.9615598.915621.815743.515841.9159298.016053.516190.716246.0163539.0164252.016554.516652.216745.5168151.0169219.0170&gt;10,00017119.917331.817468.717586.317651.3177166.017862.217933.0180116.018167.31827.718340.018717.11887.11897.619041.019110.71924.219314.01947.001972.0019846.02031.320430.920517.52068.020810.720933.002103.102112.902159.3521712.72186.62196.6220100.02249.002257.322725.02283.32297.6230105.025059.725110.525235.225320.425416.325566.525623.525714.9258343.0259199.0260560.026154.1262182.026386.7264283.0265366.0266471.0267178.0268147.0269157.0270148.02710.702751.192767.97280118.02818.902826.3528313.92847.8628578.32897.0529014.229117.5292462.52932",

The following cell membranes and ligands were used for the determination of binding to the respective D2 receptor.</p>Dopamine: 0.4 \u03bcg/well of membrane from cos-7 cell which has been transfected with cloned human Dopamine, Spiperone-I125 ligand at 150 pM final</p>Both membrane and ligand were diluted such that a 25 \u03bcl addition delivered the necessary amount per well, as noted above. Both membrane and ligand were diluted in TNE buffer. The TNE buffer was a mixture of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH=7.4, 5 mM EDTA and 50 mM NaCl. Each test compound was diluted to a concentration from 10 \u03bcM to 1 \u03bcM with 100% DMSO. To each well of a 96 well plate was added 140 \u03bcL of TNE buffer, 10 \u03bcL of the diluted test compound in DMSO, 25 \u03bcL of spiperone and 25 \u03bcL of membrane.</p>The plate was incubated on a rotating shaker for 1 hour at room temperature. The plate was filtered over GF/C Filterplates, prewetted in 0.03% polyethleneimine, in Filtermate 196 apparatus (Packard). The plate was then washed 6 times with ORL-1 buffer in the filtration apparatus and dried in vacuum oven for 1 hour at a temperature of 50\u00b0 C.</p>To each well was then added 25 \u03bcL Microscint 20 (Packard) (to solubilize bound radioactivity) and each well counted in a Packard TopCount for 1 minute/well using counting parameters optimized for the particular radioligand/opioid receptor being tested. Percent radioactive ligand bound in each reaction was calculated relative to a control using DMSO for maximum binding (no inhibition). Curves were fitted and Ki determined using Graphpad Prizm software (v3.0).</p>Representative compounds of the present invention were tested according to the procedure outlined above with results as listed in Table 14.</p>TABLE 14ID #IC<sub>50 </sub>(nM)4222208424278.2426&gt;10,000430&gt;10,0004333520439233444015174423229327387.5</p>EXAMPLE 70Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) and Spontaneous Locomotor Activity (SMA)(Pellow, S., Chopin, P., File. S. E. and Briley, M., J Neurosci Methods, (1985) 14, 149-167)</p>The procedure used in the EPM was based on the natural aversion of rodents to explore brightly illuminated open and high places, as well as their innate tendency for thigmotaxis. When rats are placed on the elevated-plus maze, they have a normal tendency to remain in the enclosed arms of the maze and avoid venturing into the open arms. Animals treated with typical or atypical anxiolytics show an increase in the percentage of time spent (% Time) and/or the percentage of entries made (% Entries) into the open arms.</p>The spontaneous locomotor activity test (SMA) was an automated procedure for measuring the effect of a test compound on spontaneous motor activity in an open-field. A drug-induced decrease in spontaneous horizontal or vertical motor activity is regarded as an indication of sedation.</p>Animals</p>Male Long-Evans Hooded rats weighing 180 to 200 grams were purchased from Charles River Inc (Portage Mich.). The rats were housed in groups of four at an ambient temperature of 21 to 23\u00b0 C. in a roo"
