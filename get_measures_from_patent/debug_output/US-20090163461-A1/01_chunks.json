Also, the Ki values of the affinity of (\u2212)-vesamicol for the \u03b4-1 receptor and \u03b4-2 receptor are 73.8\u00b111.2 nM and 346\u00b137 nM, respectively, and the Ki values indicating the affinity of the (\u2212)-o-MeVES of the present invention for the \u03b4-1 receptor and \u03b4-2 receptor are 33.7\u00b15.9 nM and 266\u00b128 nM, respectively. From this result, (\u2212)-vesamicol and the (\u2212)-o-MeVES of the present invention were found to have higher affinity for VAChT and lower affinity for the \u03b4-1 receptor and \u03b4-2 receptor compared to other ligands (SA4503, haloperidol and (+)-pentazocine).</p>From these results, it can be said that the (\u2212)-o-MeVES of the present invention maintains the properties of (\u2212)-vesamicol, i.e., high affinity for VAChT and low affinity for the \u03b4-1 receptor and \u03b4-2 receptor. Furthermore, the (\u2212)-[<sup>11</sup>C]-o-MeVES of the present invention can be said to be useful as a diagnostic reagent for a diagnostic method with VAChT as an index because it has the <sup>11</sup>C-label while retaining the above-described properties of (\u2212)-vesamicol.</p>In the aforementioned Life Sciences 71 (2002) 1591-1598, it is described that as a result of in vitro experiments using the rat brain, the affinity of (\u2212)-o-iodovesamicol for VAChT, \u03b4-1 receptor, and \u03b4-2 receptor were 15.0\u00b12.9 nM, 62.2\u00b112.0 nM, and 554\u00b1137 nM, respectively, as Ki values (mean\u00b1standard deviation). On the other hand, from Table 1-2, the Ki values of the (\u2212)-o-MeVES of the present invention for VAChT, \u03b4-1 receptor, and \u03b4-2 receptor were 6.7\u00b10.4 nM, 33.7\u00b15.9 nM, and 266\u00b128 nM, respectively. Hence, both (\u2212)-o-MeVES and (\u2212)-o-iodovesamicol have high affinity for VAChT and low affinity for the \u03b4-1 receptor and \u03b4-2 receptor; comparing them, the affinity of (\u2212)-o-MeVES for VAChT is still higher than (\u2212)-o-iodovesamicol. Also, the 6-1 receptor/VAChT ratio and 6-2 receptor/VAChT ratio of the Ki values are higher for (\u2212)-o-MeVES than for (\u2212)-o-iodovesamicol; the former is better in terms of specificity for VAChT.</p>Also, (\u2212)-o-iodovesamicol can be expected for use in SPECT, as stated above, but the (\u2212)-o-MeVES and (\u2212)-[<sup>11</sup>C]-o-MeVES of the present invention are useful in that they can be used in PET, which is better than SPECT in terms of sensitivity, resolution, and quantitative analyzability.</p>From these results, it was shown that in (\u2212)-o-MeVES, methyl group introduction to the ortho-position of the benzene ring moiety of (\u2212)-vesamicol did not influence the high affinity of (\u2212)-vesamicol for VAChT and the low affinity for the two sigma receptors. As a result, (\u2212)-o-MeVES was shown to be a VAChT ligand as good as (\u2212)-vesamicol.</p>Example 3Synthesis of (\u2212)-2-(4-(2-trimethyl stanyl phenyl)piperidino)cyclohexanol (Hereinafter to be Abbreviated as \u201c(\u2212)-o-trimethyl stanyl vesamicol\u201d))<img id=\"EMI-C00017\" path=\"US20090163461A1-20090625-C00017.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/76052661/US/20090625/A1/020090/16/34/61/US20090163461A1-20090625-C00017.TIF\"/></p>(\u2212)-o-Iodovesamicol was obtained according to the method described in Shiba et al., Life Sciences 71 (2002) 1591-1598 and Shiba et al., Annals of Nuclear Medicine Vol. 17, No. 6, 451-456, 2003.</p>(\u2212)-o-Iodovesamicol (116 mg, 0.3 mmol), hexamethylditin (246 mg, 0.75 mmol) and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (20 mg, 17.5 mmol) were added to anhydrous toluene (5 mL), and th"
