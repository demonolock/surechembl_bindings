    "ate the human or mouse receptor. FXR is expressed in the liver, small intestine, colon, ovary, adrenal gland and kidney, and is involved in intracrine signaling.</p>FXR is proposed to be a nuclear bile acid sensor. As a result, it modulates both, the synthetic output of bile acids in the liver and their recycling in the intestine (by regulating bile acid binding proteins). Upon activation (e.g. binding of chenodeoxycholic acid), it influences the conversion of dietary cholesterol into bile acids by inhibiting the transcription of key genes which are involved in bile acid synthesis such as CYP7A1. This seems to be a major mechanism of feedback regulation onto bile acid synthesis.</p>The synthetic compounds, 1,1-bisphosphonate esters, appear to display a number of similar activities to the two identified prototypes of natural FXR agonists, farnesol, and chenodeoxycholic acid. Like farnesol, the 1,1-bisphosphonate esters increase the rate of 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase degradation and like bile acids they induce the expression of the intestinal bile acid binding protein (hereinafter referred to as \u201cI-BABP\u201d) and repress the cholesterol 7 \u03b1-hydroxylase gene. Certain 1,1-bisphos-phonate esters also bind to FXR (Niesor et al., Curr Pharm Des, 7(4):231\u201359, 2001). That means that activation of FXR could lead to opposing effects, i.e., lowering the rate of cholesterol synthesis by increasing degradation of HMG-CoA reductase and increasing the cholesterol pool by inhibition of cholesterol degradation into bile acids. The FXR agonist, chenodeoxycholic acid, does not change cholesterol and lipoprotein levels significantly in patients, although a repression of bile acid synthesis as well as a decreased HMG-CoA Reductase activity was observed (Einarsson et al., Hepatology, 33(5), 1189\u201393, 2001) confirming that cellular cholesterol synthesis and degradation are controlled by numerous regulatory loops including the coordinate regulation of HMGCoA reductase and cholesterol 7\u03b1-hydroxylase and that compounds modulating FXR activity might have different effects on blood lipid parameters.</p>In the course of functional analysis of certain 1,1-bisphosphonate esters, it was shown that these compounds which are known to bind to FXR also induce apoptosis in a variety of cell types, similar to the isporenoids farnesol and geranylgeraniol which are also known as weak FXR binders (Flach et al., Biochem Biophys Res Com, 270, 240\u201346, 2000).</p>To date only very few compounds have been described which bind the NR1H4 receptor and thus show utility for treating diseases or conditions which are due to or influenced by said nuclear receptor (Maloney at al., J Med Chem, 10; 43(16): 2971\u20132974, 2000).</p>It was thus an object of the present invention to provide for a novel NR1H4 binding compound. It was also an object of the present invention to provide for compounds which by means of binding the NR1H4 receptor act as agonist or antagonist of said receptor and t",
    "e invention was solved by providing for amongst the NR1H4 nuclear receptor protein binding compounds according to the general formula (I) below such compounds which act as agonists and such compounds which act as antagonists of the human FXR receptor or a mammalian homologue thereof.</p>The invention provides for FXR agonists that may be used for the treatment of cholesterol-associated conditions or diseases. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, cholesterol lowering or cholestatic compounds are disclosed. The compounds according to the invention may be used for manufacture of antitumor medicaments and/or for the treatment of diseases such as cancer.</p>The foregoing merely summarizes certain aspects of the present invention and is not intended, nor should it be construed, to limit the invention in any manner.

It is apparent from their s",
    "cling in the intestine, by regulating bile acid binding proteins. In one embodiment of the invention, the invention concerns a method for regulating the bile transport system in a mammal. In a human, the method comprises activating the NR1H4 receptor with a therapeutically effective amount of a compound according to the invention.</p>Likewise the invention concerns a method of treating in a mammal a disease which is affected by cholesterol, triglyceride, or bile acid levels comprising administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of a compound according to the invention.</p>Accordingly, the compounds according to the invention may also be used as a method of prevention or treatment of mammalian atherosclerosis, gallstone disease, lipid disorders, obesity or cardiovascular disorders such as coronary heart disease or stroke.</p>The invention further concerns a method of blocking fatty acid absorption in the intestine of a mammal comprising administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of a compound according to the invention. The invention may also be used to treat obesity in humans.</p>The FXR alpha is a prototypical type 2 nuclear receptor that activates genes upon binding to the promoter region of target genes in a heterodimeric fashion with RXR. The relevant physiological ligands of NR1H4 are bile acids. The present compounds according to the invention have been demonstrated to have a high binding efficacy (binding coefficients measured as IC50 in the range 200 nM to 1000 nM), as well as agonistic and/or antagonistic properties. Consequently, they may be applied to regulate genes that participate in bile acid homeostasis as well as other downstream regulated genes. Examples of such genes include, but are not limited to, lipid absorption, cholesterol biosynthesis, cholesterol transport or binding, bile acid transport or binding, proteolysis, amino acid metabolism, glucose biosynthesis, protein translation, electron transport, and hepatic fatty acid metabolism. FXR often functions in vivo as a heterodimer with the RXR. Published FXR agonists such as the Glaxo SmithKline compound \u201cGW 4064\u201d (See Table 2) are known to influence the regulation of various liver genes. Genes found to be regulated by GW 4064 are genes that down regulate in the liver, genes that up-regulate in the liver and genes that have altered expression in the intestine.</p>Genes down-regulated in the liver include apolipoprotein B; plasma proteinase inhibitor alpha-1-inhibitor III group 3(m22360); L-glucono-gamma-lactone oxidase (d12754); peroxisomal enoyl-CoA: hydrotase-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA bifunctional enzyme (k03249) liver fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP, m13501), CYP4A2(m57719, and CYP3A23 (x96721); CYP3A1 (x64401); cholesterol-7-alpha-hydroxylase, CYP7A1 (RefSeq NM000780, XM 005022, XM 044651, and XM 044652); and sodium-taurocholate cotransport protein, ntcp (RefSeq NM003049, XM007466). Genes up-regulated in the liver include small heterodimer",
    "tor protein homologue. These pharmaceutical compositions contain about 0.1% to about 99.5% of the compound according to the invention, more particularly about 0.5% to about 90% of the compound according to the invention in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</p>The invention also concerns the use of a compound or combination of compounds according to the invention for the prevention or treatment of a NR1H4 receptor protein-mediated disease or condition wherein the mammal is a human. The compound(s) may be used for example, for regulating the bile transport system in a mammal, preferentially a human by activating the NR1H4 receptor, or for regulating levels of cholesterol, triglyceride, and/or bile acid in mammals, preferentially humans. The compound(s) may also be used for the treatment of atherosclerosis, gallstone disease, lipid disorders, obesity or a cardiovascular disorder.</p>The invention further concerns the use of a compound or combination of compounds according to the invention for blocking in a mammal, preferentially a human, fatty acid absorption in the intestine. Further, the inventive compounds may be used alone or in combination, for treating obesity in humans and for modulating a gene whose expression is regulated by the NR1H4 receptor. The invention further concerns the use of a compound or combination of compounds according to the invention for antitumor medicaments. The antitumor effects of such medicaments could be exerted by selective inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis of tumor cells in a way similar to described activities for certain bisphosphonates (Alberts D S, et al., Clin Cancer Res May 2001; 7(5):1246\u201350.</p>EXAMPLE 1In Vitro Screening for Compounds which Influence FXR Binding to CoactivatorsFor screening purposes a fragment of the open reading frame of human FXR alpha (NR1H4\u2014(Acc. No:AF384555)) encoding amino acids 187\u2013472 was amplified by standard RT PCR procedures (see FIGS. 2A and 2B; SEQ ID NO. 1 and 2). Starting material was total RNA derived from human liver. The resulting cDNA obtained after reverse transcription was subsequently cloned using the Gateway\u2122 recombination technology (Invitrogen, USA) into the expression plasmid pDest15 (Invitrogen, USA). This construct was used to express a recombinant GST-FXR fusion protein in E.coli (BL21 strain). A pDEST 17 derivative clone harboring an additional sequence encoding amino acids 548\u2013878 of human TIF2 (Acc. No: XM<sub>\u2014</sub>011633 RefSeq) (see FIGS. 2C and 2D, SEQ ID NO. 3 and 4) was constructed using Gateway\u2122 recombination technology (Invitrogen, USA) in order to obtain a construct which was used to express recombinant His-tagged TIF2 fragment could be expressed in E. coli. For E. coli expression of both constructs, plasmid DNA was transformed into chemically competent E. coli BL21 (Invitrogen, USA) and cells were grown to an OD600 of 0.4\u20130.7 before expression was induced by addition of 0.5 mM IPTG according instructi",

Stable HEK293FXR reporter cell lines were generated by stably transfecting with the pTRexDest30 (Invitrogen) derivatives pTRexDest30-hFXR, pTRexDest30-hRXR\u25a1 and the pGL2promoter (Promega) derivative, pGL2promoter-FXRRE. The full length human FXR (accession U68233) and the full length human RXR\u03b1 (accession P19793) were cloned into the pTRexDest30 applying the manufacturer protocols for the Gateway\u2122 system (Invitrogen).</p>The FXR response elements were cloned (upper case). 5\u2032-cccaGGGTGAaTAACCTcggggctctgtccctccaatcccaGGGTGAaTAACCTcggg 3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO. 5) was obtained from the human IBAB-P promoter (Grober et al 1999, JBC 274, pp. 29749\u201329754). A stable clone was selected and seeded at a density of 5\u00d710<sup>4 </sup>cells per well in 48 well plates. Luciferase reporter activity was measured in duplicates from extracts of cells after incubating cells in culture medium (DMEM [Gibco-BRL]+10% FCS [PAA laboratories]) for 16 hours (5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 37\u00b0 C.) containing 0.5% DMSO (control) or 0.5% DMSO with increasing concentrations of LN 0000006734.</p>The data are set forth in Table 4 below.
