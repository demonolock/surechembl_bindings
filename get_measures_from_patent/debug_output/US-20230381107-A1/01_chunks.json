    ". All syringes were then driven at a flow rate of 7 mL/min using a syringe pump. The tube outlets were positioned to collect the mixtures in a 20 mL glass vial (while stirring). The stir bar was taken out and the ethanol/aqueous solution was allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for 1 h. 4 ml of the mixture was loaded into a 5 cc syringe, which was connected to a piece of FEP tubing and in another 5 cc syringe connected to an equal length of FEP tubing, an equal amount of 100 mM citrate buffer (pH 6) was loaded. The two syringes were driven at 7 mL/min flow rate using the syringe pump and the final mixture collected in a 20 mL glass vial (while stirring). Next, the mixture collected from the second mixing step (liposomes) were passed through a Mustang Q membrane (an anion-exchange support that binds and removes anionic molecules, obtained from Pall Corporation). Before using this membrane for the liposomes, 4 mL of 1 M NaOH, 4 mL of 1 M NaCl and 10 mL of 100 mM citrate buffer (pH 6) were successively passed through it. Liposomes were warmed for 10 min at 37\u00b0 C. before passing through the membrane. Next, liposomes were concentrated to 2 mL and dialyzed against 10-15 volumes of 1\u00d7PBS using by tangential flow filtration before recovering the final product. The TFF system and hollow fiber filtration membranes were purchased from Spectrum Labs (Rancho Dominguez) and were used according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Polysulfone hollow fiber filtration membranes with a 100 kD pore size cutoff and 8 cm<sup>2 </sup>surface area were used. For in vitro and in vivo experiments formulations were diluted to the required RNA concentration with 1\u00d7PBS.</p><p id=\"p-0137\" num=\"0194\"><figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an example electron micrograph of liposomes prepared by these methods. These liposomes contain encapsulated RNA encoding full-length RSV F antigen.

The ribosomal RNA standard provided in the kit was used to generate a standard curve. Liposomes were diluted 10\u00d7 or 100\u00d7 in 1\u00d7TE buffer (from kit) before addition of the dye. Separately, liposomes were diluted 10\u00d7 or 100\u00d7 in 1\u00d7TE buffer containing 0.5% Triton X before addition of the dye (to disrupt the liposomes and thus to assay total RNA). Thereafter an equal amount of dye was added to each solution and then \u02dc180 \u03bcL of each solution after dye addition was loaded in duplicate into a 96 well tissue culture plate. The fluorescence (Ex 485 nm, Em 528 nm) was read on a microplate reader. All liposome formulations were dosed in vivo based on the encapsulated amount of RNA.</p><p id=\"p-0139\" num=\"0196\">Encapsulation in liposomes was shown to protect RNA from RNase digestion.

The working lipid and RNA solutions were heated at 37\u00b0 C. for 10 min before being loaded into 3 cc syringes. 2 mL of citrate buffer (pH 6) was loaded in another 3 cc syringe. Syringes containing RNA and the lipids were connected to a T mixer (PEEK\u2122 500 \u03bcm ID junction) using FEP tubing. The outlet from the T mixer was also FEP tubing. The third syringe containing the citrate buffer was connected to a separate piece of FEP tubing. All syringes were then driven at a flow rate of 7 mL/min using a syringe pump. The tube outlets were positioned to collect the mixtures in a 20 mL glass vial (while stirring). The stir bar was taken out and the ethanol/aqueous solution was allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for 1 hour. Then the mixture was loaded in a 5 cc syringe, which was fitted to a piece of FEP tubing and in another 5 cc syringe with equal length of FEP tubing, an equal volume of 100 mM citrate buffer (pH 6) was loaded. The two syringes were driven at 7 mL/min flow rate using a syringe pump and the final mixture collected in a 20 mL glass vial (while stirring). Next, liposomes were concentrated to 2 mL and dialyzed against 10-15 volumes of 1\u00d7PBS using TFF before recovering the final product. The TFF system and hollow fiber filtration membranes were purchased from Spectrum Labs and were used according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Polyethersulfone (PES) hollow fiber filtration membranes (part number P-C1-100E-100-O1N) with a 100 kD pore size cutoff and 20 cm<sup>2 </sup>surface area were used.

Firstly, after collection in the 20 mL glass vial but before TFF concentration, the mixture was passed through a Mustang Q membrane (an anion-exchange support that binds and removes anionic molecules, obtained from Pall Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). This membrane was first washed with 4 mL of 1 M NaOH, 4 mL of 1 M NaCl and 10 mL of 100 mM citrate buffer (pH 6) in turn, and liposomes were warmed for 10 min at 37\u00b0 C. before being filtered.
