{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that contain all four required components: a specific molecule name, ID or other identifier, a bioactivity metric (IC50, Ki, Kd, EC50), a specific numeric value for that metric, and a unit for that value. \n\nHowever, there are sentences that mention the calculation of IC50 values, but they do not provide specific numeric values or units. For example:\n\n* \"The IC50 value is calculated using an inhibition curve with at least 10 concentrations of the test substance.\"\n* \"The inhibitor concentration at which a half-maximal enzyme activity is observed is referred to as IC50.\"\n\nThese sentences do not meet the criteria because they do not provide specific molecule names, numeric values, or units. Therefore, there are no sentences to return."}
