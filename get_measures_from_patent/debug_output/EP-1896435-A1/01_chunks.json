Assay for HS L activity:</p>For the preparation of the substrate 25-50 // Ci [3H] trioleoylglycerol (in toluene), 6.8 // MoI unlabeled trioleoylglycerol and 0.6 mg phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine / phosphatidylinositol 3: 1 w / v) are mixed, dried over N2 and then in 2 ml 0.1 M KPi (pH 7.0) by sonication (Branson 250, microtip, setting 1-2, 2 x 1 min in 1-min intervals). After adding 1 ml of KPi and re-sonication (4 x 30 sec on ice at 30-sec intervals), 1 ml of 20% BSA (in KPi) is added (final concentration of trioleoyl glycerol 1.7 mM). For the reaction, prepare 100 \u03bcL substrate solution to 100 \u03bcL HSL solution (HSL as above, diluted in 20 mM KPi, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.02% BSA, 20 \u03bcg / ml pepstatin, 10 // g / ml leupeptin) and incubated for 30 min at 37 \u00b0 C. After addition of 3.25 ml of methanol / chloroform / heptane (10: 9: 7) and of 1.05 ml of 0.1 M K 2 CO 3, 0.1 M boric acid (pH 10.5) is mixed well and finally centrifuged (800 x g, 20 min). After phase separation, one equivalent of the upper phase (1 ml) is taken and the radioactivity determined by liquid scintillation measurement.</p>1.3. Evaluation of HSL inhibitory activity:</p>Substances are usually tested in four independent approaches. The inhibition of the enzymatic activity of HSL by a test substance is determined by comparison with a non-inhibited control reaction. The IC50 value is calculated using an inhibition curve with at least 10 concentrations of the test substance. For the analysis of the data the software package GRAPHIT, Elsevier BIOSOFT, is used.</p>2nd test for inhibition of EL:  2.1. Preparation of EL</p>EL is released as a secretory protein from recombinant cell lines (CHO, HEK293) in high concentration in cell culture medium (conditioned medium). This is used after concentration as an enzyme solution.</p>2.2. Assay for EL activity</p>To characterize the enzymatic activity of endothelial lipase and the action of inhibitors, the phospholipase-specific substrate is 1,2-bis (4,4-difluoro-SJ-dimethyl-bora-Sa-\u03b1-diaza-s-indacene-S). By hydrolysis of the A1 ester bond of this phospholipid by the enzyme, the fluorescent dye Bodipy is released, which after separation by thin layer chromatography on an HPTLC plate (Kieselgel 60, Merck) or can be detected directly in the reaction vessel by measuring the fluorescence.</p>To prepare the substrate solution, 100 \u03bcg of 1,2-bis (4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a, 4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-undecanoyl) -sn-glycero-3 Phospho-choline (manufacturer Molecular Probes), 2.4 mg tripalmitin (Sigma) and 7.9 mg DOP choline (1, 2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) in 393 \u03bc \\ chloroform recorded and then Transfer 157 \u03bcl into a fresh tube. After evaporation of the solvent, the lipid mixture is dissolved in 4 ml of 200 mM TRIS-HCl, 150 mM sodium chloride, pH = 7.4 by sonicating twice. The subsequent enzyme reaction takes place at 37 \u00b0 C. for 60 minutes. For this purpose, 45 .mu.l of the substrate solution with 1 .mu.l inhibitor corresponding concentration (dissolved in DMSO, for control, pure DMSO solution is used) and 5 .mu.s enzyme solution (conditioned medium) are incubated. Subsequently, 3 .mu.l of the test mixture are applied to an HPTLC plate (Kieselgel 60, Merck) and the liberated fluorescent dye is separated by means of a flow agent (diethyl ether: petroleum benzine: acetic acid [78: 22: 1]) for detection. After evaporation of the solvent, the plate is read into a fluorescence scanner.  As a measure of the enzyme activity, an increased release of the fluorescent dye in the uninhibited reaction can be observed.</p>2.3. Evaluation of the EL inhibitory effect:</p>Depending on the inhibitor concentration used, there is a reduction in the enzymatic activity, the inhibitor concentration at which a half-maximal enzyme activity is observed is referred to as IC50.</p>2.4.
