    "activation of mononuclear cells from peripheral blood. The blood was received as buffy coats from blood donors at the University Hospital of Lund. The PBMs were stimulated at a concentration of 2\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml with mitomycin C treated SEA coated BSM cells (preincubated with 100 ng/ml SEA) in medium with 10% FCS. The T cell lines were restimulated biweekly with 20 U/ml human recombinant IL-2 and weekly with mitomycin C treated SEA coated BSM cells. The cell lines were cultivated for 4-12 weeks before being used in the assay. </p> The viability of the effector cells, as determined by trypan blue exclusion, exceeded 50%. </p>Determination of MHC Class II Binding Characteristics of Wild-Type and Mutant Sea  Radioiodination Procedure </p> Appropriate amounts of wild-type or mutant SEA were radiolabeled with 10 to 25 mCi Na<sup>125</sup>I using enzymobeads with the lactoperoxidase technique (NEN, Boston, Mass.). The reaction was stopped by quenching with sodium azide and protein-bound radioactivity was separated from free iodine by filtration through a PD-10 column (Pharmacia Biotech AB, Sweden) with R10 medium as elution buffer. Conditions were chosen to obtain a stoichiometric ratio between iodine-125 and protein of \u22662:1. The radiochemical purity was verified by size-exclusion chromatography on a TSK SW 3000 HPLC column. The effect of the radioiodination on the binding activity was only tested for wild-type SEA and found not to be affected (data not shown). </p> Direct Binding Assay </p> Raji cells, 6\u00d710<sup>4</sup>/100 \u03bcl, previously cultivated in R10 medium, were added to conical polypropylene tubes and incubated (22\u00b0 C./45 min) in triplicate with 100 \u03bcl/tube of serially diluted <sup>125</sup>I-labeled wild-type or mutant SEA. The cells were washed with 2 ml 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 10 mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, centrifugated at 300\u00d7g for 5 minutes and aspirated. This procedure was repeated twice. Finally, the cells were analyzed for cell-bound radioactivity in a gamma counter (Packard Instruments Co, Downers Grove, Ill., USA). The apparent dissociation constant, K<sub>d</sub>, and the number of binding sites, N, at saturation were calculated according to Scatchard (Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 51 (1949) 660-72) after subtraction of non-specific binding (i.e. binding after incubation with R10 medium alone. </p> Inhibition Assay </p> Inhibition assay (inhibition of <sup>125</sup>I-labeled wild-type SEA binding by mutant SEAs). These inhibition experiments were carried out as is described for the direct binding assay with slight modifications. Briefly, 50 \u03bcl of <sup>125</sup>I-labeled wild-type SEA was allowed to compete with an excess of unlabeled wild-type or mutant SEA (50 \u03bcl/tube) for binding to 6\u00d710<sup>4</sup>/100 \u03bcl Raji cells. A tracer concentration yielding\u224840% bound radioactivity in the direct assay was used to obtain maximal sensitivity in the inhibition assay. The displacement capacity of the competitor was expressed as the concentration yielding 50% inhibition (IC<sub>50</sub>) of bound radioactivity. The binding affinity of the mutants relative to wild-type SEA was calculated using the equation: \n\nIC<sub>50</sub>(SEA(wt)):IC<sub>50</sub>(SEA(m)) \n</p> In order to analyze whether the mutants compete for binding to the same site on Raji cells as wild-type SEA, the binding data obtained with SEA mutants were plotted as a log-logit function and tested for parallelism with the corresponding data for wild-type SEA. </p> Inhibition Assay </p> Inhibition assay (inhibition of the binding of fluorescent-labeled wild-type SEA by unlabeled wild-type SEA and SEA mutants). Raji cells (2.5\u00d710<sup>5</sup>) were incubated with inhibitor (wild-type or mutant SEA; 0-6000 nM) diluted in 50 \u03bcl CO<sub>2</sub>-independent medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FCS, glutamine and gentamycin at 37\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes. Fluorescein conjugated wild-type SEA was added to a final concentration of 30 nM and the samples were incubated for an additional half hour at 37\u00b0 C. The samples were washed"
