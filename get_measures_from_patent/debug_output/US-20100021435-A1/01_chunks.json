    "t may be amplified using PCR conditions and parameters well known in the art. Gene products that may be amplified include insulin, insulin-2, Glut2, Igf2, IAPP, glucagon, ngn3, PDX1, somatostatin, ipf1, and islet-1. Changes in the relative levels of gene expression may be determined using standard methods. The expression of \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3-, and \u03b4-cell specific markers may show that the MDIs, aggregates or clusters of cells derived from monocyte-derived stem cells (MDSCs) are composed of all four distinct types and three major types of pancreatic cells.</p>The formation of functional monocyte-derived islets (MDIs) may be determined by monitoring the synthesis and secretion of factors such as insulin and c-peptide during the differentiation of MDSC-derived MDIs. Contact with high levels of glucose may stimulate the MDIs to secrete insulin or c-peptide. Contact with tolbutamide or other insulin agonists may stimulate the MDIs to secrete increased levels of insulin. The levels of insulin or c-peptide may be measured in the culture medium of the different cells the using an ELISA protocol. Other methods known in the art may be used to monitor the secretion of insulin or c-peptide by the differentiated cells.</p>c. Proliferation</p>The MDI may be induced to proliferate by contacting it with differentiation medium comprising glucose, which may be at a concentration of 5-40 mg/dL, 10-25 mg/dL, or 18-25 mg/dL. The proliferation may be monitored by staining the MDI with propidium iodide or Ki-67, which may be followed by flow cytometry.</p>2. Methods of Using the MDIThe MDI may be used to replenish a cell population that has been reduced or eradicated by a disease or disorder, as a treatment for such a disease or disorder, or to replace damaged or missing cells or tissue(s). The MDI may be given autologously or to a allogenically compatible subject.</p>Diabetes mellitus is an example of a disease state associated with an insufficiency or effective absence of certain types of cells in the body. In this disease, pancreatic islet \u03b2-cells are missing or deficient or defective. The condition can be treated, or at least one of its symptoms ameliorated, by insertion of MDIs. The MDIs may be derived from MDSC isolated from a patient that is healthy, or who may have type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Both type 1 diabetes mellitus juvenile-onset diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (adult-onset diabetes) may be treated with MDIs. Other disorders that may be treated with MDIs include hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, obesity, Metabolic Syndrome, and hypertension.</p>MDIs may be inserted into the body by implantation, transplantation, or injection of cells. The cells may be introduced as single cells or clusters of cells. Methods of transplanting pancreatic cells are well known in the art. See for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,997,443 and 4,902,295 that describe a transplantable artificial tissue matrix structure containing viable cells, preferabl",
    " that the differentiated aggregates secreted c-peptide, whereas the de-differentiated MDSCs produced no or extremely low levels of c-peptide.</p>Example 5 Insulin Secretion During Tolbutamide InductionTo further examine the function of these differentiated islet-like cells, the effects of tolbutamide and glucose were studied in parallel. Cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of glucose (5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 25 mM) in the presence or absence of 10 \u03bcM tolbutamide for periods of 12 minutes each. The secretion of insulin was analyzed using an insulin ELISA kit (see Example 3). For these experiments pancreatic clusters were collected and plated in a 24 well format with 2 ml of Krebs-ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 5 mM glucose. FIG. 7 shows that tolbutamide stimulated the secretion of insulin by these pancreatic islet clusters. Furthermore, these clusters responded to increasing glucose concentrations. These clusters generated physiologically relevant levels of insulin ranging between 140-270 ng/ml. Similar results were also observed using other insulin agonists, while the addition of insulin antagonists generally resulted in a decrease in insulin secretion.</p>Example 6 Monocyte-Derived Islet Cells Exhibit Increased ProliferationThe following demonstrates that monocyte-derived islet cells (MDIs) exhibit increased proliferation in response to pancreatic medium and high glucose levels (25 mM). To assay the proliferation of MDSCs and MDIs the expression of Ki-67, a marker strictly associated with cell proliferation, was assayed. During interphase, this antigen can be exclusively detected within the nucleus, whereas in mitosis most of the protein is relocated to the surface of the chromosomes. The fact that the Ki-67 protein is present during all active phases of the cell cycle (G(1), S, G(2), and mitosis), but is absent from resting cells (G(0)), makes it an excellent marker for determining the so-called growth fraction of a given cell population.</p>The effects of high glucose on MDI proliferation as measured by Ki-67 is shown in FIG. 8. For this analysis flow cytometry was used to count the percentage of cells that stained positive for Ki-67 in MDSCs cultures from day 2 to 12. During this experiment, MDSCs were cultured in de-differentiation medium that contained M-CSF and LIF for 6 days. After 6 days MDSCs were transferred to pancreatic medium containing low glucose (5 mM). After an additional 6 days, cultures were transferred to pancreatic medium containing high glucose (25 mM). A relatively low level of proliferation, which increased until day 6, was observed. During these first 6 days, the MDSCs underwent a period of differentiation and typically exhibited a low level of proliferation. Once treated with pancreatic medium (day 7-12), proliferation was extremely low. During this period, MDSCs exhibited several morphological changes and transitioned from a fibroblast state into a more neural appearance. In addition, the cells formed into aggregates, and eventually into free floating clusters. However, after adding a high amount of glucose at day 12, the MDIs exhibited a dramatic increase in overall cell proliferation.</p>This effect is further illustrated in Table 2 below, which shows the percentage of cells in S, G0/G1, and G2/M phases at days 2, 6, 8, 12, and 17 as measured by propidium iodide (PPI) levels in flow cytometry analysis. Higher rates of proliferation were indicated by the higher percentage of cells in S phase.</p>TABLE 2Proliferation of MDSCs and MDIs as measured by PPI% S phaseG0/G1G2/MMDSCs d 22.8394.691.77MDSCs d 64.1377.038.68MDSCs d 81.5596.491.03MDIs d 121.296.751.28MDIs d 1721.566.964"
