    "letion of a first round of treatment with an active compound. </p> [0137] A compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, prodrug, metabolite, polymorph or solvate thereof, can modulate the activity of a molecular target (e.g., a target protein methyltransferase). Modulating refers to stimulating or inhibiting an activity of a molecular target. Preferably, a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, prodrug, metabolite, polymorph or solvate thereof, modulates the activity of a molecular target if it stimulates or inhibits the activity of the molecular target by at least 2-fold relative to the activity of the molecular target under the same conditions but lacking only the presence of said compound. More preferably, a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, prodrug, metabolite, polymorph or solvate thereof, modulates the activity of a molecular target if it stimulates or inhibits the activity of the molecular target by at least 5-fold, at least 10-fold, at least 20-fold, at least 50-fold, at least 100-fold relative to the activity of the molecular target under the same conditions but lacking only the presence of said compound. The activity of a molecular target may be measured by any reproducible means. The activity of a molecular target may be measured in vitro or in vivo. For example, the activity of a molecular target may be measured in vitro by an enzymatic activity assay or a DNA binding assay, or the activity of a molecular target may be measured in vivo by assaying for expression of a reporter gene. </p> [0138] A compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, prodrug, metabolite, polymorph or solvate thereof, does not significantly modulate the activity of a molecular target if the addition of the compound does not stimulate or inhibit the activity of the molecular target by greater than 10% relative to the activity of the molecular target under the same conditions but lacking only the presence of said compound. </p> [0139] As used herein, the term \"isozyme selective\" means preferential inhibition or stimulation of a first isoform of an enzyme in comparison to a second isoform of an enzyme (e.g., preferential inhibition or stimulation of a protein methyltransferase isozyme alpha in comparison to a protein methyltransferase isozyme beta). Preferably, a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, prodrug, metabolite, polymorph or solvate thereof, demonstrates a minimum of a fourfold differential, preferably a tenfold differential, more \n\n preferably a fifty fold differential, in the dosage required to achieve a biological effect. </p>Preferably, a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, prodrug, metabolite, polymorph or solvate thereof, demonstrates this differential across the range of inhibition, and the differential is exemplified at the IC<sub>50</sub>, i.e."
