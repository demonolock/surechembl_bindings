    "-la receptors (Bureau J et al, \u201cModification of Prostaglandin E2 and Collagen Synthesis in Keratoconus Fibroblasts Associated with an Increase of Interleukin 1 Alpha Receptor Number,\u201d C R Acad Sci III, 1993, 316:425-430). Another key actor may be IL-17, a proinflammatory cytokine that is associated with many chronic inflammatory conditions (). Interestingly, Jun et al (2011) detected elevated levels of IL-17 in tear fluid samples of KC patients. IL-l 7 has been associated with pathogenic mechanisms in corneal inflammation by stimulating stromal cells to secrete various pro -inflammatory cytokines (Maertzdorf J et al,\u201cIL-l 7 Expression in Human Herpetic Stromal Keratitis: Modulatory Effects on Chemokine Production by Comeal Fibroblasts,\u201d J Immunol, 2002 Nov 15, 169(10):5897-5903) including IL-6, IL-8, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM- 1) (Gabr MA et al, \u201cInterleukin- 17 Synergizes With IFNy or TNFa to Promote Inflammatory Mediator Release and Intercellular Adhesion Molecule- 1 (ICAM-l) Expression in Human Intervertebral Disc Cells f J Or hop Res, 2011, 29(1): 1-7). As stated above, despite its simple structure, HA has a plethora of interacting properties with numerous proteins (Vigetti D et al,\u201cHyaluronan Synthesis is Inhibited by Adenosine Monophosphate-activated Protein Kinase Through the Regulation of HAS2 Activity in Human Aortic Smooth Muscle Cells,\u201d Journal of Biological Chemistry, 2011, 286(l0):79l7-7924). As stated by Vignetti et al (2011), HMW HA (&gt;1000 kD) and CD44 induce cell migration and promote the wound healing process (Tzircotis G et al, \u201cChemotaxis Towards Hyaluronan is Dependent on CD44 Expression and Modulated by Cell Type Variation in CD44-Hyaluronan Binding\u201d, Journal of Cell Science, 2005, 118(21):5119-5128); moreover, the directionality of cell migration is strongly dependent \n\n on CD44 expression and on the HA gradient in extracellular matrix (ECM) environment (Acharya PS et al, Fibroblast Migration is Mediated by CD44-Dependent TGF Beta Activation,\u201d J Cell Sci, 2008, 121 (Pt 9): 1393-1402)). Other engagement of HA include regulation and binding of growth factors and regulation of enzymatic activities. </p> As atopy is a risk factor for the development of KC, as prophylaxis to prevent or delay the onset of KC, the composition may be topically administered to the ocular surface of atopic patients under 30 year of age, and in all young contact lens wearers, because contact lens wearing causes comeal tissue changes similar to atopy. </p> Optionally, the HMW HA may be topically administered to the ocular surface before, during, or after one or more treatments for KC, such as: comeal cross-linking (CXF), custom soft contact lenses, gas permeable contact lenses,\u201cpiggybacking\u201d contact lenses, hybrid contact lenses, scleral and semi-scleral lenses, prosthetic contact lenses, surgically applied comeal inserts (e.g., Intacs products), topography-guided conductive keratoplasty, or comeal transplant, or a combination of tw"
