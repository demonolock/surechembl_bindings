    "\u03b2\u03b3 IL-2Rs (3), implicating that CD25 confers high-affinity binding of IL-2 to its receptor but is not crucial for signal transduction. Trimeric IL-2Rs are found on activated T cells and CD4+ forkhead box P3 (FoxP3)+T regulatory cells (Treg), which are sensitive to IL-2 in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, antigen-experienced (memory) CD8+, CD44 high memory-phenotype (MP) CD8+, and natural killer (NK) cells are endowed with high levels of dimeric \u03b2\u03b3 IL-2Rs and these cells also respond vigorously to IL-2 in vitro and in vivo.</p>Expression of the high-affinity IL-2R is critical for endowing T cells to respond to low concentrations of IL-2 that is transiently available in vivo. IL-2R\u03b1 expression is absent on naive and memory T cells but is induced after antigen activation. IL-2R\u03b2 is constitutively expressed by NK, NKT, and memory CD8+ T cells but is also induced on naive T cells after antigen activation. \u03b3c is much less stringently regulated and is constitutively expressed by all lymphoid cells. Once the high-affinity IL-2R is induced by antigen, IL-2R signaling upregulates the expression of IL-2R\u03b1 in part through Stat5-dependent regulation of Il2ra transcription (Kim et al., 2001). This process represents a mechanism to maintain expression of the high-affinity IL-2R and sustain IL-2 signaling while there remains a source of IL-2.</p>IL-2 is captured by IL-2R\u03b1 through a large hydrophobic binding surface surrounded by a polar periphery that results in a relatively weak interaction (Kd 10-8 M) with rapid on-off binding kinetics. However, the IL-2R\u03b1-IL-2 binary complex leads to a very small conformational change in IL-2 that promotes association with IL-2R\u03b2 through a distinct polar interaction between IL-2 and IL-2R\u03b2. The pseudo-high affinity of the IL-2/\u03b1/\u03b2 trimeric complex (i.e. Kd \u02dc300 pM) clearly indicates that the trimeric complex is more stable than either IL-2 bound to the \u03b1 chain alone (Kd=10 nM) or to the \u03b2 chain alone (Kd=450 nM) as shown by Ciardelli's data. In any event, the IL-2/\u03b1/\u03b2 trimer then recruits the \u03b3 chain into the quaternary complex capable of signaling, which is facilitated by the large composite binding site on the IL-2-bound R chain for the \u03b3 chain.</p>In other words, the ternary IL-2R\u03b1-IL-2R\u03b2-IL-2 complex then recruits \u03b3c through a weak interaction with IL-2 and a stronger interaction with IL-2R\u03b2 to produce a stable quaternary high-affinity IL-2R (Kd 10-11 M which is 10 pM). The formation of the high-affinity quaternary IL-2-IL-2R complex leads to signal transduction through the tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Jak3, which are associated with IL-2R\u03b2 and \u03b3c, respectively (Nelson and Willerford, 1998). The quaternary IL-2-IL-2R complex is rapidly internalized, where IL-2, IL-2R\u03b2, and \u03b3c are rapidly degraded, but IL-2R\u03b1 is recycled to the cell surface (H\u00e9mar et al., 1995; Yu and Malek, 2001). Thus, those functional activities that require sustained IL-2R signaling require a continued source of IL-2 to engage IL-2R\u03b1 and form additional IL-2-IL-2R signaling complexes.</p>Regulatory T cells actively suppress activation of the immune system and prevent pathological self-reactivity and consequent autoimmune disease. Developing drugs and methods to selectively activate regulatory T cells for the treatment of autoimmune disease is the subject of intense research and, until the development of the present invention, which can selectively deliver active interleukins at the site of inflammation, has been largely unsuccessful. Regulatory T cells (Treg) are a class of CD4+CD25+ T cells that suppress the activity of other immune cells. Treg are central to immune system homeostasis, and play a major role in maintaining tolerance to self-antigens and in modulating the immune response to foreign antigens. Multiple autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), and Graft-versus-Host Dise",

For example, muteins can be prepared that have desired binding affinity for a cognate receptor.</p>As noted above, any of the mutant IL-2 polypeptides disclosed herein can include the sequences described; they can also be limited to the sequences described and otherwise identical to SEQ ID NO: 1. Moreover, any of the mutant IL-2 polypeptides disclosed herein can optionally include a substitution of the cysteine residue at position 125 with another residue (e.g., serine) and/or can optionally include a deletion of the alanine residue at position 1 of SEQ ID NO: 1.</p>Another approach to improving the therapeutic index of an IL-2 based therapy is to optimize the pharmacokinetics of the molecule to maximally activate Treg cells. Early studies of IL-2 action demonstrated that IL-2 stimulation of human T cell proliferation in vitro required a minimum of 5-6 hours exposure to effective concentrations of IL-2 (Cantrell, D. A., et. al., 1984, Science, 224: 1312-1316). When administered to human patients, IL-2 has a very short plasma half-life of 85 minutes for intravenous administration and 3.3 hours subcutaneous administration (Kirchner, G. I., et al., 1998, Br J Clin Pharmacol. 46:5-10). Because of its short half-life, maintaining circulating IL-2 at or above the level necessary to stimulate T cell proliferation for the necessary duration necessitates high doses that result in peak IL-2 levels significantly above the EC50 for Treg cells or will require frequent administration. These high IL-2 peak levels can activate IL-2R\u03b2\u03b3 receptors and have other unintended or adverse effects, for example VLS as noted above. An IL-2 analog, or a multifunctional protein with IL-2 attached to a domain that enables binding to the FcRn receptor, with a longer circulating half-life than IL-2 can achieve a target drug concentration for a specified period of time at a lower dose than IL-2, and with lower peak levels. Such an IL-2 analog will therefore require either lower doses or less frequent administration than IL-2 to effectively stimulate Treg cells. Less frequent subcutaneous administration of an IL-2 drug will also be more tolerable for patients. A therapeutic with these characteristics will translate clinically into improved pharmacological efficacy, reduced toxicity, and improved patient compliance with therapy. Alternatively, IL-2 or muteins of IL-2 (herein, \u201cIL-2*\u201d) can be selectively targeted to the intended site of action (e.g., sites of inflammation). This targeting can be achieved by one of several strategies, including the addition of domains to the administered agent that comprise blockers of the IL-2 (or muteins) that are cleaved away or by targeting domains or a combination of the two.</p>In some embodiments, IL-2* partial agonists can be tailored to bind with higher or lower affinity depending on the desired target; for example, an IL-2* can be engineered to bind with enhanced affinity to "
