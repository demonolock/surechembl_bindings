I., et al., 1998, Br J Clin Pharmacol. 46:5-10).\nBecause of its short half-life, maintaining circulating IL-2 at or above the level necessary to stimulate T cell proliferation for the necessary duration necessitates high doses that result in peak IL-2 levels significantly above the EC50 for Treg cells or will require frequent administration."}
