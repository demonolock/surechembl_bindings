    " in comparison with the wild type Env. All mutants showed a readily detectable level of fusion activity ranging 20-100% of that of the wildtype Env (FIG. 24A). In the presence of S2C3, the single mutant W666A showed an IC<sub>50 </sub>of 9.9 \u03bcM, as compared to 4.4 \u03bcM for the wild type Env (FIG. 24B and Table 2, below). A triple mutant W666S/L669S/I675S exhibited the greatest resistance to S2C3 with an IC<sub>50 </sub>of 16.7 \u03bcM. Moreover, two other mutants, K683A and K683A/R<sup>696</sup>A, became more sensitive to S2C3 than the wildtype Env, suggesting the increased hydrophobicity of the binding pocket may lead to more effective recognition by the compound. As a comparison, a mutant (mTMD) containing multiple changes in the TMD even with reversed hydrophobicity in the region showed no significant difference in S2C3 inhibition from the wild type Env (FIG. 24B and Table 2). These results suggest that the hydrophobicity of the S2C3 binding pocket in the MPER is a useful determinant for the compound inhibition of HIV-1 Env-mediated membrane fusion.</p>TABLE 2IC<sub>50</sub>s of HIV-1 Env mutants measured in the cell-cell fusion assay.HIV-1 EnvIC50 (\u03bcM)Wild type4.4 \u00b1 0.41W666S/L669S/I675S16.7 \u00b1 2.16\u2002W666A/L669S/I675S11.5 \u00b1 1.11\u2002W666A/L669S/I675S/W680S14.9 \u00b1 0.75\u2002W666S7.8 \u00b1 0.57W666A/W672K7.6 \u00b1 1.24W666A9.9 \u00b1 0.58K683A2.6 \u00b1 0.97R696A2.1 \u00b1 0.23K683A/R696A~0.9mTMD (L704S/V705S/N706A/V708S/R709A/Q710A)5.3 \u00b1 0.21*The data were generated in triplicate from two independent experiments.

Most drug targets involve either an enzyme active site (such as those of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and protease) or a ligand binding site (such as those of cell receptors). It has also been suggested that all the obvious human \u201cdruggable\u201d targets may have been exhausted by conventional approaches, and thus the pharmaceutical industry has begun to shift its focus towards protein-based biologics. There are some limitations of protein-based therapy, however, including high cost for production, inability to penetrate membranes to reach intracellular targets and unwanted immune responses. It is therefore still desirable, for treatment of most diseases, to develop orally available small-molecule drugs.</p>In this study, a neutralizing monoclonal antibody was used that targeted HIV-1 gp41 to guide the search for leads of novel therapeutics against a nonconventional site\u2014the MPER. Monoclonal antibodies have been used as therapeutics to treat human diseases because they can specifically target functional sites of key proteins in disease-related pathways<sup>48,49</sup>. They too, however, may suffer from drawbacks similar to those of other biologics. As described herein a neutralizing antibody "
