    "imeric HIV-1 CNE58 Env ectodomain containing the DS substitutions. Guinea pigs immunized with (4) or (6) returned high peak OD values against BG505 V3 Peptide ELISA, confirming immunogenicity of these proteins. A control assay using this V3 peptide and mAb 447-52D showed strong binding as a reference. </p> FIG. 11 is a graph showing data from an endpoint titer assay of binding to the BG505 V3 peptide by sera collected from the animals immunized with nanoparticles (4), (5), or (6) listed in FIG. 10. \n\n The data shows that guinea pigs immunized with (4) or (6) generate high endpoint titers against BG505 V3 Peptide at 6+ weeks by ELISA. </p> FIG. 12 shows a set of graphs of results for size exclusion gel filtration chromatography of two- component insect ferritin nanoparticles including recombinant influenza HA stem proteins as antigens. </p> FIG. 13 shows a set of graphs of results for the antigenicity of two-component insect ferritin nanoparticles including recombinant influenza HA stem proteins as antigens. </p> FIG. 14 shows a set of EM images for two-component insect ferritin nanoparticles including recombinant influenza HA stem proteins as antigens. </p> FIG. 15 shows a set of graphs of results for the immunogenicity of two-component insect ferritin nanoparticles including recombinant influenza HA stem proteins as antigens. Immune sera was collected from mice immunized with the indicated nanoparticle and evaluated for binding to various influenza strains by endpoint ELISA binding assay. </p>SEQUENCES </p> The nucleic and amino acid sequences listed in the accompanying sequence listing are shown using standard letter abbreviations for nucleotide bases, and three letter code for amino acids, as defined in 37 C.F.R. 1.822. Only one strand of each nucleic acid sequence is shown, but the complementary strand is understood as included by any reference to the displayed strand. The Sequence Listing is submitted as an ASCII text file in the form of the file named \"Sequence.txt\" (~1 Mb), which was created on June 27, 2017 which is incorporated by reference herein. In the accompanying sequence listing: </p> SEQ ID NO: 1 is the amino acid sequence of Trichoplusia ni ferritin heavy chain. </p> SEQ ID NO: 2 is the amino acid sequence of Trichoplusia ni ferritin heavy chain with 18-aa N- terminal truncation (ntl9). </p> SEQ ID NO: 3 is the amino acid sequence of manduca ferritin heavy chain. </p> SEQ ID NO: 4 is the amino acid sequence of manduca ferritin heavy chain with 38-aa truncation</p>(nt39). </p> SEQ ID NO: 5 is the amino acid sequence of Trichoplusia ni ferritin light chain. </p> SEQ ID NO: 6 is the amino acid sequence of Trichoplusia ni ferritin light chain with an 29-aa N-terminal truncation (nt30). </p> SEQ ID NO: 7 is the amino acid sequence of manduca ferritin light chain. </p> SEQ ID NO: 8 is the amino acid sequence of manduca ferritin light chain with a 48-aa N- terminal truncation (nt49). </p> SEQ ID NOs: 9-25 are amino acid sequences of HTV"
