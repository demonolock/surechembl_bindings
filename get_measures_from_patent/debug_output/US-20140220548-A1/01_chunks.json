    "essary to facilitate efficient integrin binding of the matrix via the RGD sequences within the immunocloaking material to the vascular endothelial cell family of integrins. To achieve this firm binding an adequate magnitude of oxidative metabolism must be maintained in the perfusing tissue or organ. A sufficient level of oxidative metabolism is necessary in order to facilitate the requisite translocation of the vascular endothelial cell integrins that are normally localized at the abluminal surfaces of the cells. The translocation occurs upon signal transduction initiated by the layering of the laminin components of the solubilized extracellular matrix preparation. With adequate oxidative metabolism as measured by oxygen consumption across the tissue or organ of &gt;0.1 cc/min/g, the translocated integrins are expressed on the luminal surface of the vascular endothelium. This translocation of the surface integrins, in particular but not exclusively the \u03b21 family of integrins, results in the firm binding of the re-polymerized extracellular matrix to the vascular luminal surfaces of the blood vessels within the tissue or organ. This firm binding persists following reimplantation and reperfusion. Following such reimplantation and reperfusion the re-polymerized extracellular matrix remains intact along the luminal surfaces within the vasculature for a minimum of 21 days rendering the tissues and organs nonimmunogenic and nonthrombogenic.</p>Competitive Binding AssayA competitive binding assay was used to evaluate the binding capacity of each of the control and improved preparations of extracellular matrix material. Vascular endothelial cells were grown to confluence in tissue culture wells. The confluent monolayer was washed three times. The immunocloaking material prepared in accordance with the method of U.S. Pat. No. 5,643,712 was compared for binding efficiencies to the material produced by the method of the present invention. The testing was performed in triplicate with 100 \u03bcl of each preparation added to the confluent vascular endothelial cells. The extracellular matrix preparation were incubated for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. and then copiously washed to remove any unbound extracellular matrix material. The wells were then treated with anti-\u03b21 integrin IgG and incubated again at 37\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes. Following incubation, the wells were again copiously washed and a fluorescein tagged anti-IgG was added and the wells were again incubated for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. The labeled wells were then read using a PerkinElmer VICTOR2 multilabel counter. The wells treated with the extracellular matrix made using the process of the U.S. Pat. No. 5,643,712 patent contained significantly more fluorescence than the extracellular matrix produced by the method of the present invention.
