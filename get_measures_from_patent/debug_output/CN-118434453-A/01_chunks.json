For example, the tumor cells may include, but are not limited to, solid tumor cells, such as, but not limited to, gastric cancer cells, or breast cancer cells, such as, but not limited to, HCC1569 cells or MDA-MB-453 cells.</p>The drug conjugates of the application may have targeted inhibition. The targeted inhibition may be a decrease in the proliferation potency of tumor cells expressing at a specific target level by 1% or more, 2% or more, 4% or more, 5% or more, 8% or more, 10% or more, 15% or more, 18% or more, 20% or more, 25% or more, 40% or more, 50% or more, 60% or more, 70% or more, 80% or more, 90% or more, or 95% or more, compared to the addition of a negative control or control drug, in a culture medium of tumor cells expressing at a specific target level. For example, the number of the cells to be processed, the targeted inhibition may be such that the IC50 value (nM) of tumor cells highly expressed in a specific target may be 10000 or less, 5000 or less, 4000 or less, 3000 or less, 2000 or less, 1000 or less, 500 or less, 400 or less, 300 or less, 200 or less, 185 or less, 150 or less, 120 or less, 110 or less, 100 or less, 99 or less, 98 or less, 97 or less, 95 or less, 91 or less, 80 or less, 74 or less, 70 or less, 65 or less, 62 or less, 60 or less, 50 or less, 40 or less, 30 or less, 25 or less, 23 or less, 22 or less, 20 or less, 19 or less, 18 or less, 18.5 or less below 17, below 15, below 12, below 10, below 9, below 8.5, below 7, below 6.7, below 6, below 5.9, below 5.5, below 5.0, below 4.8, below 4.5, below 4.4, below 4, below 3.5, below 3, below 2.5, below 2, below 1.5, below 1.0, below 0.5, below 0.3, below 0.29, below 0.25, below 0.21, below 0.20, below 0.18, below 0.17, below 0.15, below 0.12, below 0.10, below 0.09, below 0.08, below 0.07, below 0.06, below 0.05, below 0.04, below 0.03, below 0.02, or below 0.01. For example, the tumor cells at the specific target level may include, but are not limited to, solid tumor cells, e.g., the tumor cells at the specific target level may include, but are not limited to, gastric cancer cells, or breast cancer cells, e.g., the tumor cells at the specific target level may include, but are not limited to, HCC1569 cells or MDA-MB-453 cells.

The animal may include, but is not limited to, a mammal, for example the animal may include, but is not limited to, a cat, dog, horse, pig, cow, sheep, rabbit, mouse, rat, monkey, or human. The administration may include, but is not limited to, oral, intravenous drip, intraperitoneal injection, or topical administration.</p>The drug conjugates of the application may have a bystander killing effect (Bystander Effect). The bystander killing effect can be that the drug conjugate has no obvious inhibition effect on the cell proliferation of the tumor cell with low expression of the specific target, and in the co-culture of the tumor cell with low expression of the specific target and the tumor cell with high expression of the specific target, the drug conjugate can simultaneously inhibit the cell proliferation of the tumor cell with low expression of the specific target and the tumor cell with high expression of the specific target.   For example, in co-culture of tumor cells in which the specific target is low-expressed with tumor cells in which the specific target is high-expressed, the inhibitory activity may be such that the IC50 value (nM) of the tumor cells in which the specific target is low-expressed is 10000 or less, 5000 or less, 4000 or less, 3000 or less, 2000 or less, 1000 or less, 500 or less, 400 or less, 300 or less, 200 or less, 185 or less, 150 or less, 120 or less, 110 or less, 100 or less, 99 or less, 98 or less, 97 or less, 95 or less, 91 or less, 80 or less, 74 or less, and,   70 or less, 65 or less, 62 or less, 60 or less, 50 or less, 40 or less, 30 or less, 25 or less, 23 or less, 22 or less, 20 or less, 19 or less, 18 or less, 18.5 or less, 17 or less, 15 or less, 12 or less, 10 or less, 9 or less, 8.5 or less, 7 or less, 6.7 or less, 6 or less, 5.9 or less, 5.5 or less, 5.0 or less, 4.8 or less, 4.5 or less, 4.4 or less, 4 or less, 3.5 or less, 3 or less, 2.5 or less, 2 or less, 1.5 or less, 1.0 or less, 0.5 or less, 0.3 or less, 0.29 or less, and 0.29 or less,   0.25 or less, 0.21 or less, 0.20 or less, 0.18 or less, 0.17 or less, 0.15 or less, 0.12 or less, 0.10 or less, 0.09 or less, 0.08 or less, 0.07 or less, 0.06 or less, 0.05 or less, 0.04 or less, 0.03 or less, 0.02 or less, or 0.01 or less.   The tumor cell in which the specific target is low-expressed may have an expression that is reduced by 1% or more, 2% or more, 4% or more, 5% or more, 8% or more, 10% or more, 15% or more, 18% or more, 20% or more, 25% or more, 40% or more, 50% or more, 60% or more, 70% or more, 80% or more, 90% or more, or 95% or more, as compared to a tumor cell in which the specific target i",
    "was 0-0.3, and free <sup>89</sup> Zr antibody Rf was 0.6-1.0.</p>PET imaging: each animal was intravenously injected with about 100uCi [ <sup>89</sup> Zr ] Zr antibody. Images were collected and analyzed with a small animal PET imager at designated times after injection.</p>In vivo efficacy study: the animals were maintained and used according to IACUC guidelines. Food and beverage were freely obtained from BALC/b nude mice and NPG mice purchased from CHARLES RIVER and SPF Biotech, respectively, at 25 \u2103 in a 12 hour dark/bright cycle. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models were generated by subcutaneous implantation of cryopreserved tissue fragments. When the tumor size reached 100-200mm <sup>3</sup>, the animals began to receive medication and were euthanized at 1000mm <sup>3</sup>. Health was observed daily. Tumor size and body weight were monitored and recorded every 3 days.</p>Software: data were analyzed using Olinda, GRAPHPAD PRISM, 6.0, or EXCEL.</p>Example 1.1</p>Murine 3F8 was incubated with SP2/0 wild-type cells or cells that overexpressed HER3, HER2 or EGFR.

Murine 3F8 recognizes human and monkey HER3, with similar efficacy, but does not recognize mouse and rat HER3.</p>Example 1.5</p>The EC50 of murine 3F8 binding to human, monkey, rat and mouse HER3 was analyzed with GRAPHPAD PRISM 6.0.0. The results are shown in Table 2. Murine 3F8 showed the same binding affinity in the nanomolar range for human and cynomolgus monkey HER 3.</p>TABLE 2 EC50 of murine 3F8 binding to human, cynomolgus monkey, rat or mouse HER3</p>Example 1.6</p>Murine 3F8 blocks NRG 1-induced HER3 phosphorylation. NCI-N87, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-453 were treated with the HER3 ligand NRG1 to induce downstream phosphorylation of HER 3. The effect of murine 3F8 on inhibition of NRG 1-induced p-HER3 was determined by western blot. 3D4 is a previously demonstrated anti-HER 3 antibody that competes with NRG1 for binding to HER3, serving as a positive control.</p>The results are shown in FIG. 4. The data show that murine 3F8 reduced HER3 protein phosphorylation levels, but had no effect on total HER3 protein levels. Western blot of HER2 also showed that 3F8 had no effect on HER2 protein levels.</p>Example 1.7</p>Murine 3F8 is rapidly taken up by cells with different HER3 surface levels. Cells with different HER3 surface levels were incubated with murine 3F8 ice (control) or at 37 \u2103 for 1 or 4 hours. The internalization fraction was determined by subtracting the 37 \u2103 incubated cell surface signal from the ice incubated control.</p>The results are shown in FIG. 5. The data indicate that murine 3F8 is rapidly internalized into cells. Most is absorbed within 1 hour and the amount of intracellular fragments increases slightly as the incubation time extends to 4 hours, indicating that 3F8 endocytosis is a rapid and continuous process.</p>Example 1.8</p>The anti-HER 3 antibodies effectively inhibited tumor growth in BT474 subcutaneous xenograft models.
