    "ic expression vector pIRESlneo (Clontech) , gal4- PPAR \u03b1. Stable cell lines were generated by transfection with both gal4-SEAP and gal4-PPAR\u03b1 or with 3XPPRE-SEAP, using Lipofectamine Plus (Gibco) following the manufacturer's directions. Cells were plated onto 96 well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. The next day, serial dilutions of the compounds in growth media</p>(DMEM plus 10% charcoal/dextran stripped FBS) containing 0.5% (v/v) DMSO, were added in duplicate to non-adjacent wells, and allowed to incubate for 24 - 40 hours at 37\u00b0 C, 5% C02. Each plate had at least 6 wells of 1 \u03bcM standard, GW-2331 (an authentic PPAR\u03b1 selective agonist) as positive control, rosiglitazone (an authentic PPAR\u03b3 agonist) as negative control and 3 wells of DMSO alone media as control. Following the incubation, media was removed, and endogenous phosphatases were inactivated as indicated above and SEAP activity in 25\u03bcl aliquots of processed media was assayed in clear bottom, black 96 well plate (Falcon) by the addition of 100 \u03bcl Attophos reagent (Promega) , incubation for 5 minutes in the dark at room temperature, and measuring the increase in fluorescence (excitation 450 nm, emission 580 nm) in a CytoFluor series 4000 plate reader (Perseptive Biosystems) 8 cycles, 1 minute/cycle. The relative rates of fluorescence emission were calculated as fold increase over DMSO control. Intrinsic activity was defined as the activity of the test compound at 1 \u03bcM as % of activity of the 1 \u03bcM standard. The EC50 values were calculated using standard equations for mid-point of the activity curves. \n\n Example 64: In vivo obese animal model</p>C57BL/6 mice were fed a diet rich in fat (40%) and sucrose (40%) (see, York {Genetic models of obesity} and Sclafani (Dietary models of obesity}, both in Obesi ty, Bjorntorp and Brodoff eds. JB Lippincott Company, 1992; Mclntosh and Pederson; McNeill, eds. CRC press LLC, 337- 398, 1999; Farrelly et al . , Proc. Natl . Acad. Sci . 96 :</p>14511-14516, 1999) . Under these dietary conditions, C57BL/6 mice gain considerable body weight and become obese . These mice were treated with a dual PPAR\u03b3 antagonist/PPAR\u03b1 agonist (dose 0.01 to 100 mg/kg/day), administered in a pharmacologically acceptable vehicle (such as but not limited to, 5% CM-cellulose) through orally, intravenous, subcutaneous or intraportal injection, or mixed with food or water, acutely or over an extended period of time. During the course of the study, various parameters such as water and food consumption, body weight gain, body composition by dual emission X-ray analyzer (DEXA, this instrument accurately measures body fat mass, body lean muscle mass and body bone mineral content) , body temperature was measured by standard methods. Through tail vein bleeding, blood was collected in heparin-EDTA coated tubes to prevent clotting and blood plasma was separated and analyzed for glucose, free fatty acids, triglycerides and cholesterol using reagent kits available from Roche Diagnostic"
