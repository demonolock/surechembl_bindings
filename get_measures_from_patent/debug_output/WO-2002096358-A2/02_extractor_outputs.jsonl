{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n* Each plate had at least 6 wells of 1 \u03bcM standard, GW-2331 (an authentic PPAR\u03b1 selective agonist) as positive control, rosiglitazone (an authentic PPAR\u03b3 agonist) as negative control and 3 wells of DMSO alone media as control.\n* The EC50 values were calculated using standard equations for mid-point of the activity curves.\n* These mice were treated with a dual PPAR\u03b3 antagonist/PPAR\u03b1 agonist (dose 0.01 to 100 mg/kg/day), administered in a pharmacologically acceptable vehicle (such as but not limited to, 5% CM-cellulose) through orally, intravenous, subcutaneous or intraportal injection, or mixed with food or water, acutely or over an extended period of time.\n\nNote that only the first sentence contains all four required components: a specific molecule name (GW-2331), a bioactivity metric (not explicitly mentioned but implied by the context of \"standard\"), a specific numeric value (1 \u03bcM), and a unit (\u03bcM). The other two sentences do not meet all the criteria, but I included them as they provide some relevant context. However, upon re-reading the instructions, I realized that I should only include sentences that meet all the criteria. Therefore, the revised answer is:\n\n* Each plate had at least 6 wells of 1 \u03bcM standard, GW-2331 (an authentic PPAR\u03b1 selective agonist) as positive control, rosiglitazone (an authentic PPAR\u03b3 agonist) as negative control and 3 wells of DMSO alone media as control."}
