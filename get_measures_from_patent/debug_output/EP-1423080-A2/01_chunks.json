The gene product contained a novel zinc finger motif common to several DNA-binding proteins and the mRNA encoded a predicted 106 kd chimeric protein containing most of the PML sequences fused to a large part of RAR alpha, including its DNA- and hormone-binding domains. In transient expression assays, the hybrid protein exhibited altered transactivating properties if compared with the wild-type RAR alpha progenitor. Identical PML-RAR alpha fusion points were found in several patients, suggesting that in APL the t(15;17) translocation generates an RAR mutant that could contribute to leukemogenesis through interference with promyelocytic differentiation.</p>\n  NCBI # S50916 (SEQ ID NOs 206 and 207) relate to a PML-RAR fusion gene</p>\n  {fusion transcript} [human, mRNA Partial, 1284 nt].

In studies of a t(ll;19) translocation, they identified a chimeric protein containing the amino-terminal 'AT-hook' motifs of the MLL gene on cliromosome 11 fused to a previously undescribed protein from chromosome 19. The nucleotide sequence determinations demonstrated an open reading frame that coded for a predicted 62-kD protein, which Tkachuk et al. named ENL. \n\n Nakamura et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 90: 4631-4635, (1993), showed that the gene on chromosome 19 that is fused to the MLL gene in patients with leukemia and translocation t(l 1 ; 19)(q23 ;p 13) shows high sequence homology to the genes on chromosome 4 and cliromosome 9 that are fused with the ALLl gene in patients with translocation t(4; 1 l)(q21 ;q23) and t(9; 11 )(p22;q23), respectively. The 3 protein gene products contained nuclear targeting sequences as well as serine-rich and proline-rich regions. The results suggested that the different proteins fused to ALLl polypeptides. These leukemias provide similar functional domains.</p>\n  Negrini et al., Cancer Res 1993 Oct l;53(19):4489-92, reported potential topoisomerase II DNA-binding sites at the breakpoints of a t(9 ; 11 ) cliromosome translocation in acute myeloid leukemia. The event examined was a t(9;l I)(p22;q23) chromosome translocation and the breakpoints on the two chromosomes occurred within introns of the involved genes: AF-9 on chromosome 9, and ALL-1 on chromosome 11. Sequence analysis identified heptamers flanking the breakpoints on both chromosomes 9 and 11, suggesting that the N-D-J recombinase was involved in the translocation.

    "nt is located within an intron of the Evi-1 gene, and resulted in overexpression of a normally unexpressed, aberrant form of Evi-1 protein, in which the C-terminal 44 amino acids of wild-type Evi-1 protein were truncated and replaced by five amino acids. The truncated Evi-1 protein was shown to increase API activity when expressed in NIH3T3 cells as its wild-type counterpart. The origin of this peculiar type of rearrangement of the Evi-1 gene was shown not to be an artifact during establishment of the cell line, but rather an event that occurred in the primary leukemic cells, and consistent with 3q21q26 syndrome.</p>\n  NCBI # S82592 (SEQ ID NOs 229 and 230) relate to an Evi-l=Evi-l protein {3' region, deletion region} [human, megakaryoblastoid cell line MOLM-1, chronic myelocytic leukemia patient, mRNA Partial Mutant, 916 nt].
