However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, and components have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the present invention.</p>In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method for treating, inhibiting or suppressing a hexokinase-2 (HK2)-expressing cancer or tumor in a subject comprising contacting one or more cells of said subject with a therapeutically effective amount of a compound that promotes the detachment of Hexokinase 2 (HK2) from the mitochondria. In one embodiment, the compound is a jasmonate derivative, as described herein. In another embodiment, the compound is a piperazine derivative, as described herein.</p>In another embodiment, the present invention provides a compound that promotes the detachment of Hexokinase 2 (HK2) from the mitochondria for use in inhibiting the proliferation of hexokinase-2 (HK2)-expressing cells in a subject.

    "ce). For these three primary antibodies, a polymer system was used as a secondary antibody (KDB-10046 and KDB-10007, Nordic Biosite, Taby, Sweden). Semi-quantitative analysis was done in a blinded manner by a single experienced pathologist scoring \u00d740 high power fields, 7 different fields per slide.</p>HK Catalytic Activity AssayHexokinase catalytic activity was determined by the coupled enzymatic assay in which hexokinase catalyzes the conversion of glucose to G6P, which is then oxidized by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) in the presence of NADP to form 6-Phospho-D-Gluconate and NADPH. NADPH production results in a colorimetric signal at 340 nm, which is proportional to the hexokinase catalytic activity. The readings were recorded in an ELISA plate reader Infinite 200 ELISA reader (Tecan, Mannedorf, Switzerland).</p>Statistical AnalysisStatistical analysis was carried out using Graphpad Prism version 5.03 (Graphpad Software, San Diego, Calif.).</p>Example 1Formula C Selectively Modulates VDAC1/HK2 Interactions In Vitro, Leading to ApoptosisThe activity of Formula C in a cell-free assay was evaluated using Microscale Thermophoresis (MST) analysis, which is based on altered movement of a protein in a temperature gradient when bound to other molecules. The HKs were first allowed to bind with VDAC1 to form the VDAC1/HK complexes prior to the addition of Formula C. An addition of Formula C selectively dissociated the VDAC1/HK2 complex in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 0.092 \u03bcM. Formula C had no effect on the VDAC1/HK1 complex (FIG. 1).</p>The cellular effect of Formula C was demonstrated in human skin SCC A431 cells (which express both HK1 and HK2). Cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of Formula C, followed by mitochondrial isolation and Western Blot (WB) analysis (FIG. 2A). Semi-quantification of the WB revealed that within 2 hours, there was a dose-dependent reduction of mitochondrial-bound HK2 levels, with an IC50 of approximately 0.8 \u03bcM (FIG. 2B); in contrast, HK1 association with the mitochondria was not affected by Formula C in a similar experimental setup (data not shown). Formula C reduced cellular ATP levels by as much as 50% following 2-hour incubation in A431 cells, demonstrating the energetic outcome of HK2 dissociation from the mitochondria (FIG. 2C).</p>Apoptosis induction by treatment with Formula C was demonstrated in two ways: a) reduction of cytochrome C levels in the mitochondrial fraction within 2 hours of treatment, as evaluated by WB and semi-quantification (FIG. 3A) and increase in cellular levels of cleaved caspase-3 within 6 hours of treatment (FIG. 3B). These two early events are in line with a caspase-dependent apoptotic mechanism (Kvansakul and Hinds 2015).</p>The effect of Formula C on cellular viability was demonstrated in XTT assay in A431 cSCC cells (FIG. 3C) and the human AK line, HT-297.T, resulting in IC50 values of 0.014 and 0.228 \u03bcM, respectively. Furthermore, Formula C had a low affinity in this assay for the normal transformed human skin keratinocyte line, HaCaT (IC50=3.37 \u03bcM), supporting the notion that it is selective. Formula C was evaluated in colony forming assay (CFA) in a panel of 57 patient-derived tumors and cancer cell lines, where it exhibited a strong anti-proliferation effect (IC50&lt;2 uM) in 70% of tested cancer types. Dose-response curves for a subset of these tumor models are shown in FIG. 3C. HK2 protein levels in each of these 57 tumor models were determined by WB, semi-quantified, and normalized to a [0-1] range. FIG. 4A shows a statistically significant correlation (p=0.0002) between cellular HK2 levels and Formula C IC50 values. The complete list of tumor models tested in CFA and XTT is shown in Table 1.</p>TABLE 1IC50 values for Formula C in various cell lines and tumor modelsTumorModelTumor typeDesignationNumberType/AssayIC50 (uM)1Normal immortalHaCaTCell line/XTT*\u20023.37keratonocytes2Skin SCCA431Cell line/XTT0.0143Actinic keratosisHT-297.TCell line/XTT0.2284ColonCXF\u2002243PDX**/CFA***1.7595ColonCXF\u2002280PDX/CFA5.4426ColonCXFHCT 116PDX/CFA4.3347StomachGXF\u2002214PDX/CFA1.9438StomachGXF\u200397PDX/CFA6.4549Head &amp; NeckHNXF\u2002536PDX/CFA1.43510Head &amp; NeckHNXF\u2002908PDX/CFA3.87811Head &amp; NeckHNXF2205PDX/CFA3.95912Leukemia (ALL)LEXFALCCRF-CEMCell line/CFA0.20613Leukemia (AML)LEXFAMOCI-AML2Cell line/CFA0.98514Leukemia (AML)LEXFAMKG-1Cell line/CFA\u20021.1615Leukemia (AML)LEXFAMMV4-11Cell line/CFA1.20316Leukemia (AML)LEXFAMNOMO-1Cell line/CFA1.42417Leukemia (AML)LEXFAMHL-60Cell line/CFA1.54518Leukemia (AML)LEXFAMPL-21Cell line/CFA1.73719Leukemia (AML)LEXFAMKG-1aCell line/CFA1.91820Leukemia (AML)LEXFAMTHP-1Cell line/CFA2.18221Leukemia (ALL)LEXFALMOLT-4Cell line/CFA2.27722Leukemia (BCLL)LEXFCLMEC-1Cell line/CFA1.16223Leukemia (BCLL)LEXFCMJURL-MK1Cell line/CFA1.66624Leukemia (BCLL) LEXFCMK-562Cell line/CFA2.33825Leukemia (BCLL)LEXFCMMEG-01Cell line/CFA2.75826Leukemia (BCLL)LEXFCMEM-2Cell line/CFA2.78227Liver (HCC)LIXFHHep G2Cell line/CFA5.19728Lung (NSCLC,LXFL\u2002430PDX/CFA0.237large)29Lung (NSCLC,LXFA1012PDX/CFA1.362adeno)30Lung (NSCLC,LXFA\u2002629PDX/CFA1.383adeno)31Lung (NSCLC,LXFA1041PDX/CFA\u20031.5adeno)32Lung (NSCLC",

Similarly, Formula C was a more potent inhibitor of colony formation in tissues and cell lines having high HK2 levels (greater than 0.5; FIG. 4A; p=0.0002).</p>In contrast, no correlation was observed between Formula C's in vitro cancer inhibitory activity in a tissue or cell line and the protein levels of HK1 (FIG. 4C) or VDAC (FIG. 4D) in the tissue or cell line.</p>To note, Formula C did not affect the catalytic activity of either HK1 (FIGS. 5A-5B) nor HK2 (FIGS. 5C-5D), nor did it affect the kinetic parameters, K<sub>M </sub>or V<sub>max</sub>, for either substrates, ATP (FIGS. 5A, 5C) or glucose (FIGS. 5B, 5D), suggesting that Formula C is an allosteric modulator of the VDAC1/HK2 complex.</p>Example 2Formula C Effects on CTCL Tumor CellsThe cell lines tested were from a large collection of patient-derived (PDX) and cell line-derived (CDX) human tumor xenografts growing subcutaneously in immunodeficient nude mice (Oncotest GmbH, a Charles River Division). The majority of the xenografts have been directly transplanted from patients and passaged in nude mice. The xenografts retain most of the characteristics of the parental patient tumors including histology and sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs, and efficacy tests in tumor-bearing nude mice largely replicate the response of the donor patient to stand",
