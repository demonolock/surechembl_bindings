    "the factors Villa, IXa and X on the surface of activated platelets. One of the reactions of activated platelets is the presentation of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol along the surfaces. The exposure of these phospholipids makes possible the formation of the protease complex. Factor VIII has the function of a receptor for the factors IXa and X in this process. Factor VIII therefore represents a cofactor in the coagulation cascade. The activation of factor VIII with the formation of the factor Villa, the actual receptor, requires only a minimal amount of thrombin , As the concentration of thrombin increases, the factor Villa is finally further cleaved and inactivated by thrombin. This dual</p>Thrombin activity relative to Factor VIII results in self-limiting protease complex formation and, thus, a limitation of blood clotting.  In the activation of human platelets by thrombin PARI and PAR4 play a central role; Activation of these receptors in platelets leads to morphological changes, release of ADP, and aggregation of platelets (S.Brass, Nature 413: 26-27, 2001).</p>Inhibitors of PARI are described, for example, in EP 1391451, EP 1391452, US 6063847, US 2004/152736, US 2004/176418, US 2004/192753, US 2005/267155, US 2006/063847, US 2006/079684, US 2007/149518, US Pat.

The compounds of the formula I are therefore suitable for prophylactic as well as for therapeutic use in humans, which suffer from diseases associated with thrombosis, embolism, hypercoagulability or fibrotic changes.</p>Examples of such diseases are thrombosis, deep venous thrombosis,</p>Pulmonary embolism, cerebral infarction, heart attack, high blood pressure, inflammatory</p>Diseases, rheumatism, asthma, glomerulonephritis or osteoporosis. The</p>\u00a0Compounds of the formula I can be used for secondary prevention and are suitable for both acute and long-term therapy. The</p>Compounds of the formula I can also be used in combination with active ingredients which have antithrombotic principles other than PARI.</p>The invention therefore relates to a compound of the formula I,</p><img id=\"imgf000005_0001\" path=\"imgf000005_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/169672527/WO/20111020/A1/002011/12/84/21/imgf000005_0001.tif\"/> and / or all stereoisomeric or tautomeric forms of the compound of formula I and / or mixtures of these forms in any ratio, and / or a physiologically acceptable salt of the compound of formula I, wherein</p>R1 and R2 are the same or different and are each independently</p>Are hydrogen, - (C &lt;| -C 6) -alkyl, -O- (C 1 -C 6) -alkyl, aryl, halogen or hetaryl, where alkyl, aryl and hetaryl are each unsubstituted or mono-, di- or tri-independently independently of one another by F, Cl, Br, C",
    "on of the end products can be used. These starting materials were previously prepared enantiomerically pure or diastereomerically pure by literature methods. This may in particular mean that either enantioselective processes are used in the synthesis of the skeletons, or else an enantiomer separation or diastereomer separation is carried out at an early stage of the synthesis and not at the stage of the end products. Likewise, a simplification of the separations can be achieved by two-stage or multi-stage procedure.</p>The invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions and pharmaceutical preparations, characterized by an effective content of at least one compound of formula I and / or a physiologically acceptable salt of the compound of formula I and / or a stereoisomeric or tautomeric form of the compound of formula I, together with a pharmaceutically suitable and physiologically acceptable carrier, additive and / or other active ingredients and excipients. The invention further relates to a compound of the formula I and / or all  stereoisomeric or tautomeric forms of the compound of the formula I and / or mixtures of these forms in any ratio, and / or a physiological</p>Compatible salt of the compound of formula I, for use as</p>Pharmaceutical or drug in a drug.</p>Because of the pharmacological properties, the compounds according to the invention are suitable, for example, for the prophylaxis, secondary prevention and therapy of all diseases which can be treated by inhibition of the protease-activated receptor 1 (PARI). Thus, the compounds of the invention are suitable both for a prophylactic and for a therapeutic use in humans. They are suitable for both acute treatment and chronic treatment in long-term therapy. The compounds of formula I can be used in patients suffering from disorders of well-being or diseases associated with thrombosis, embolism, hypercoagulability or fibrotic changes. These include myocardial infarction, angina pectoris and all other forms of acute coronary syndrome, acute stroke or its secondary prevention, peripheral vascular</p>Diseases including deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, embolic or thrombotic events due to cardiac arrhythmias, cardiovascular events such as restenosis after revascularization, angioplasty and similar procedures such as stenting and bypass surgery.</p>Furthermore, the compounds of formula I can be used in all</p>Interventions that lead to a contact of the blood with foreign surfaces as in dialysis patients and patients with indwelling catheters. Compounds of Formula I can be used to reduce the risk of thrombosis after surgical procedures such as knee and hip joint operations. Compounds of the formula I are suitable for the treatment of patients with disseminated intravascular</p>Coagulation, sepsis, and other intravascular events associated with a</p>Associated with inflammation.  Furthermore, compounds of the formula I are suitable for the prophylaxis and treatment of patients wi"
