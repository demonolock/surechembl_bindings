The promoter used may be a synthetic or natural promoter, including a SPV promoter, a poxvirus promoter, or a promoter derived from different viruses or cells such as promoters derived from eukaryotic or prokaryotic organisms. Specific examples of promoters include the vaccinia virus 7.5- kD promoter (P7.5k) (Davison A. J. et al, J. Mol. Biol, 210(4):749-69 (1989)), 11-kD promoter (PI lk) (Bertholet et al, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci.,82:2096-2100 (1985)) or 28-kD promoter (P28k) (Weir J. P. &amp; Moss B., J. Virol. 61 :75-80 (1987)), or an artificial synthetic Poxvirus promoter (Ps), the thymidine kinase promoter of herpesvirus (Ross L. J., Gen. Virol. 74:371-377 (1993)), gB protein promoter (supra) of HVT or MDV, the \n\n IE promoter of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) (Alting-Mess M. A., Nucleic Acids Res., 17:9494 (1989)), SV40 promoter (Gunning P., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 84:4931- 4835 (1987)), [beta] actin promoter (supra, and Kost A. T., Nucleic Acids Res., 11 :8287-8301 (1983)), [beta] -globin promoter (Spitzner J. R., Nucleic Acids Res., 18: 1- 11 (1990)), the LTR promoter of Rous sarcoma virus (Fiek A. et al, Nucleic Acids Res., 20: 1785 (1992)), and the like. In addition, promoters of the structural proteins or the essential genes of SPV can also be used. rSPV of the invention may contain several foreign gene sequences, located in a same cloning region (i.e., IL18bp) and/or in distinct cloning sites (one of them being IL18bp). In a particular embodiment, the rSPV of the invention comprises at least 2 foreign gene sequences encoding two distinct antigens (from a same or distinct pathogen). In a further particular embodiment, the rSPV of the invention comprises at least a foreign gene sequence encoding a PCV2 antigen and a foreign gene sequence encoding a distinct antigen. In another particular embodiment, the rSPV of the invention comprises a foreign gene sequence encoding an antigen and a foreign gene sequence encoding an adjuv",

The resulting plasmid was named as pSP90 (Fig. l). </p> Between EcoRI and HmdIII sites in the multi-restriction enzyme sites of pSP90 were replaced with the oligonucleotide adapter prepared by annealing two synthetic DNA oligonucleotides of SEQ ID NOs: 7 and 8. The resulting plasmid was named as pSP91 (Fig. l). </p>SEQ ID NO: 7: </p>AATTGCCCGGGTACCGTCGATCGACTTTTTATGGCCCCCCCGGCCA SEQ ID NO: 8: </p> AGCTTGGCCGGGGGGGCCATAAAAAGTCGATCGACGGTACCCGGGC </p>The DNA fragment of 'P7.5 promoter -LacZ' gene cassette derived from pNZ76, which was cut with HmdIII and Smal of pNZ76 and followed by blunting by DNA polymerase (described in the USP5,387,519) was ligated into Smal site of pSP91. The resulting plasmid was named as pSP92 (Fig. l), and 'P7.5-LacZ' gene cassette was inserted into the IL-18bp gene (from 8,146nt to 7,745nt in the SPV genome). The 0.8kb i?g/I-cut-fragment derived from pGTPs-Ess_ORF2 (Example 1 of WO2014/ 167060) was inserted into Sfil site of pSP92, and the resulting plasmid was named as pSP92-Ess_ORF2 (Fig. l). This plasmid included the 'strong poxvirus \n\n promoter (Ps)-Ess_ORF2 (modified PCV2-ORF2)' gene cassette also within the IL- 18bp gene, and was used as a homology plasmid to make a recombinant SPV, SVR12. </p>(2) Constructing pSP91 l-EssORF2 (Fig.2) </p>The sequence between Kpnl and Pstl of pSP91 were replaced with the synthetic adapter shown in SEQ ID NO: 9 to insert the vaccinia virus 11 -kD promoter into it.

Sub-confluent ESK-4 cells in a 6-well plate were infected with wild-type SPV (wtSPV), and 17 hrs later the wtSPV- infected cells were transfection with 2 \u03bcg of pSP92-Ess_ORF2 using Lipofectamin Plus reagent (Invitrogen) and allowed to incubate at 37\u00b0C for 5 days until cytopathic effect (CPE) had occurred. Cell lysates from infected-transfected cells were screened for recombinant plaques expressing \u03b2-galactosidase by the addition of 0.5 mg/ml Bluo-gal (Invitrogen Cat. No.: 15519-028) in the nutrient agarose overlay. Two independent wtSPV-free recombinant viruses were purified through 3-4 rounds of screening. The purified rSPV was designated as SVR12. Two purified clones of SVR12 were designated 1H2C9D4G5 and 2F5D5E5 clones. \n\n (2) Production of SVR13 (Fig.3)"
