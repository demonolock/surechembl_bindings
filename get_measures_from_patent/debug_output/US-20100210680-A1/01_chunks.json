Following 1.5 hour incubation at room temperature, reaction is terminated by vacuum filtration through a cell harvester onto a pre-soaked (0.03% PEI in assay buffer (Tris HCl, pH 7.4)) Whatman GF/B filter plate. Counts per minute (cpm) determined by scintillation counter. Protein concentation of membrane determined from standard curve of known concentration of bovine serum albumin (BSA); optical density read at 595 nm. Linear regression fitted to standard curve and calculation of membrane sample protein concentation performed using GraphPad Prism 4.0 or equivalent.</p>1.2. Data AnalysisUsing PRISM 4.0 or equivalent, free ligand concentration (nM) is plotted against the total, non-specific and specific binding. Non-linear regression and one site binding (hyperbola) used for calculation of ligand concentration, K<sub>D </sub>(nM) and Bmax (pmol/mg protein) values:</p>y=Bmax.x(KD+x)</p>159.2 Competition Binding AssaysThe aim of these assays are to determine binding efficiency of a compound using inhibition of [3H] mesulergine (Amersham) binding to human 5HT2C (INI) receptors expressed in NIH-3T3 cells as membrane homogenates.</p>Clozapine used as a reference; total binding determined by 1% DMSO; and non-specific binding determined by 10 \u03bcM clozapine. Assay format uses 96 deep-well microtitre plates in a total volume of 500 \u03bcl, such that each well contains 395 \u03bcl membrane, 5 \u03bcl test compound concentation or DMSO or clozapine, and 100 \u03bcl of appropriate concentration of radioligand. Following 1.5 hour incubation at room temperature, assay terminated by vacuum filtration through a cell harvester onto pre-soaked (0.03% PEI in assay buffer) Whatman GF/B filter plates. Radiation (cpm) counted using scintillation counter.</p>159.3 Data AnalysisResults are expressed relative to the maximal clozapine binding. Percentage effect is calculated for each well by correlating the cpm value with the mean of the values of the MIN wells (0%) and with the mean of the values of the MAX wells (100%) obtained from the same plate with the following formula:</p>%\ue89e\ue89eEffect=(value-MIN)(MAX-MIN)\u00d7100\ue89e\ue89e%</p>The individual effects at each concentration are used to fit the following four-parameter curve:</p>y=A+(B-A)(1+(10Cx)D)</p>Where A=min, B=max, C=inflection point (log<sub>10 </sub>(EC<sub>50</sub>)=\u2212pEC<sub>50</sub>) and D=hill slope.</p>Calculation of pKi, negative logarithm of the equilibrium dissociation constant, Ki</p>Ki=EC\ue89e\ue89e50(1+([L]/KD))</p>Where EC<sub>50</sub>=Concentration at point of inflection, [L]=radioligand concentration and K<sub>D</sub>=equilibrium dissociation constant for the radioligand (expressed in the appropriate units of concentration).</p>EXAMPLE 160Penile Erection/Head Shake Protocol160.1 IntroductionAdministration of 5-HT<sub>2C </sub>agonists induces penile erections in rats. This phenomenon is known to be mediated by 5-HT<sub>2C </sub>receptors since it can be reversed by treatment with a selective 5-HT<sub>2C </sub>antagonist. Activation of the 5-HT<sub>2A </sub>receptor induces head shakes, and this effect can be reversed by selective 5-HT<sub>2A </sub>antagonists. The test is used to evaluate a test compound for its activity at 5-HT<sub>2C </sub>and/or 5-HT<sub>2A </sub>receptors (Berendsen HHG, Jenck F, Broekkamp CLE. Psychopharmacology 1990; 101: 57-61).</p>160.2 Materials and MethodsGroup housed male Wistar rats (Harlan Olac Ltd., Bicester, UK) weighing 200 g+ are housed in standard conditions with food and water ad-lib.</p>The test is carried out in a transparent perspex observation chamber (W: 10 cm, D: 10 cm, H20 cm). The test is videoed, 2 cameras are placed in front of the chambers and 2 below the chambers enabling all round observation of the rats.</p>Each experiment consists of a control group and n (usually 3) groups receiving test compound.</p>160.3 ProcedureAnimals are habituated to the observation chambers on at least 3 occasions prior to the experiment.</p>On the day of the experiment each rat is weighed and identified (usually by tail marking). The test compound or vehicle is administered."
