    "1 scFv antibody and conjugates thereof including a biologically-active molecule. Such conjugates may comprise a chimeric receptor to direct T cells to respond to RORI cancer cells. Thus, the scFv may be used to target cells expressing ROR1 for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes.</p>Before the present methods are described, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to particular compositions, methods, and experimental conditions described, as such compositions, methods, and conditions may vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for purposes of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting, since the scope of the present invention will be limited only in the appended claims.</p>As used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms and \u201cthe\u201d include plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, references to \u201cthe method\u201d includes one or more methods, and/or steps of the type described herein which will become apparent to those persons skilled in the art upon reading this disclosure and so forth.</p>Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.</p>As shown previously, some patients developed IgG anti-CLL autoantibodies, which reacted with RORI. These post-treatment antisera reacted with a protein of about.125 kD found in lysates of CLL cells or CHO-ROR1 cells, but not in lysates prepared from human blood lymphocytes of normal donors or non-transfected CHO cells. That these antisera reacted with RORI was corroborated via ELISA using a recombinant RORI fusion-protein. Because these antisera appeared specific for C1,1, cells, the expression of RORI on other adult tissues was studied. These studies revealed that expression of the ROR1 protein was restricted to CLL B-cells and was not found on the non-leukemic blood or marrow mononuclear cells of patients with CLL, potentially allowing for detection of CLL cells in the blood or marrow of patients with early-stage disease or minimal residual disease after therapy. Furthermore, ROR1 was not found on normal adult tissues or lymphoid cells, including CD5-positive B cells. As such, ROR1 appears to represent a specific leukemia-associated antigen (LAA).</p>ROR1 encodes a type I membrane receptor tyrosine kinase that initially was identified using oligonucleotide primers targeting sequences encoding amino acid sequences common to tyrosine kinase domains of different proteins. This protein appears highly conserved throughout evolution. ROR1. is evolutionary conserved among Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), Aplysia, Drosophila melanogasier, Xenopus, mice, and humans. In rodents, RORI is expressed primarily in developing cephalic neural crest in the dorsal part of the diencephalons and mid-hind brain boundary during embryogenesis. Work in Cae",

Typically, the antibody binds with an affinity corresponding to a K<sub>D </sub>of about 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M or less, and binds to the predetermined antigen with an affinity (as expressed by K<sub>D</sub>) that is at least 10 fold less, and preferably at least 100 fold less than its affinity for binding to a nonspecific antigen (e.g., BSA, casein) other than the predetermined antigen or a closely-related antigen. Alternatively, the antibody can bind with an affinity corresponding to a KA of about 10<sup>6 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>, or about 10<sup>7</sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>, or about 10<sup>8</sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>, or 10<sup>9</sup>M<sup>\u22121 </sup>or higher, and binds to the predetermined antigen with an affinity (as expressed by KA) that is at least 10 fold higher, and preferably at least 100 fold higher than its affinity for binding to a non-specific antigen (e.g., BSA, casein) other than the predetermined antigen or a closely-related antigen. In some embodiments the scFv antibody conjugate or peptide of the invention will have the same KA or K<sub>D </sub>as an antibody produced by the hybridoma having ATCC accession number PTA 8634.</p>The term \u201ckd\u201d (sec<sup>\u22121</sup>), as used herein, is intended to refer to the dissociation rate constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction. This value is also referred to as the off value. The term \u201cK<sub>D</sub>\u201d (M<sup>\u22121</sup>), as used herein, is intended to refer to the dissociation equilibrium constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction.</p>The term \u201cka\u201d (M<sup>\u22121</sup>sec<sup>\u22121</sup>), as used herein, is intended to refer to the association rate constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction. The term \u201cK<sub>A</sub>\u201d (M), as used herein, is intended to refer to the association equilibrium constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction.</p>Naturally occurring antibodies are generally tetramers containing two light chains and two heavy chains. Experimentally, antibodies can be cleaved with the proteolytic enzyme papain, which causes each of the heavy chains to break, producing three separate subunits. The two units that consist of a light chain and a fragment of the heavy chain approximately equal in mass to the light chain are called the Fab fragments (i.e., the \u201cantigen binding\u201d fragments). The third unit, consisting of two equal segments of the heavy chain, is called the Fc fragment. The Fe fragment is typically not involved in antigen-antibody binding, but is important in later processes involved in ridding the body of the antigen.</p>Because Fab and F(ab\u2032)<sub>2 </sub>fragments are smaller than intact antibody molecules, more antigen-bindin"
