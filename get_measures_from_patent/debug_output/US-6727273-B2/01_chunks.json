    "ense of reagent into the wells to avoid stripping the receptor from the well surface.</p>For library screening, 150 microliters of 1 nM<sup>3</sup>H-estradiol (New England Nuclear, Boston, Mass.) in 20 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 6 mM monothioglycerol, 5 mM KCI, pH 7.8 was mixed with 50 microliters of the test compound (in same buffer) in a 96 well mictrotiter plate (Costar 3794), resulting in a final estradiol concentration of 0.6 nM. In addition, several dilutions of estradiol, centered on the IC<sub>50 </sub>of 1-2 nM were also added to individual wells to generate a standard curve. The plates were gently shaken to mix the reagents. A total of 150 microliters from each of the wells is added to the corresponding wells of the pre-coated ER(\u03b2 plates. The plates were sealed (Packard #6005185) and the components in the wells were incubated at room temperature either for 4 hours or at 4\u00b0 C. overnight. The receptor bound ligand was read directly after incubation using a scintillation counter (TRILUX, Wallac). The amount of receptor bound ligand was determined directly, i.e., without separation of bound from free ligand. If estimates of both bound and free ligand were required, the supernatant was removed from the wells, liquid scintillant added, and the wells counted separately in a liquid scintillation counter.</p>5.2.2.3 ER\u03b1/ER\u03b2 Transactivation Assays</p>5.2.2.3.1 Construction of Transfected CHO Cells</p>The above-mentioned transfected CHO cells were derived from CHO KI cells obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (\u201cATCC\u201d, Rockville, Md.). The transfected cells were modified to contain the following four plasmid vectors: (1) pKCRE with DNA for the human estrogen receptor, (2) pAG-60-neo with DNA for the protein leading to neomycin resistance, (3) pRO-LUC with DNA for the rat oxytocin promoter and for firefly luciferase protein, and (4) pDR<sub>2 </sub>with DNA for the protein leading to hygromycine resistance. All transformations with these genetically modified CHO cells were performed under rec-VMT containment according to the guidelines of the COGEM (Commissie Genetische Modificatie). Screening was performed either in the absence of estradiol (estrogenicity) or in the presence of estradiol (anti-estrogenicity).</p>ReagentsThe following reagents were prepared using ultra pure water (milli-Q quality):</p>1. Culture Medium</p>Dulbecco's MEM/HAM F12 powder (12.5 g/l; Gibco, Paisley, UK) was dissolved in water. Sodium bicarbonate (2.5 grams/liter (\u201cg/l\u201d)), L-glutamine (0.36 g/I) and sodium pyruvate (5.5\u00d710<sup>\u22122 </sup>g/l) were added. This medium was supplemented with an aqueous mixture (0.50 ml/l medium) of ethanolamine (2.44 ml/l), sodium selenite (0.9 mg/l), and 2-mercaptoethanol (4.2 ml/l). The pH of the medium was adjusted to 7.0\u00b10.1 with NaOH or HCl (1 mol/l), and the medium was sterilized by membrane filtration using a filter having 0.2 \u03bcm pores. The resulting serum-free culture medium was stored at 4\u00b0 C.</p>2. Antibiotic"
