    "or the individual dsR As encompassed by the invention can be made using conventional methodologies or on the basis of in vivo testing using an appropriate animal model, as described elsewhere herein. </p> Advances in mouse genetics have generated a number of mouse models for the study of various human diseases, such as pathological processes mediated by TTR expression. Such models are used for in vivo testing of dsRNA, as well as for determining a therapeutically effective dose. A suitable mouse model is, for example, a mouse containing a plasmid expressing human TTR. Another suitable mouse model is a transgenic mouse carrying a transgene that expresses human TTR. </p> The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of compositions featured in the invention lies generally within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the methods featured in the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range of the compound or, when appropriate, of the polypeptide product of a target sequence (e.g., achieving a decreased concentration of the polypeptide) that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography. </p> The dsRNAs featured in the invention can be administered in combination with other known agents effective in treatment of pathological processes mediated by target gene expression. In any event, the administering physician can adjust the amount and timing of dsRNA administration on the basis of results observed using standard measures of efficacy known in the art or described herein. .

The pharmaceutical compositions of \n\n the present invention may be administered in a number of ways depending upon whether local or systemic treatment is desired and upon the area to be treated. Administration may be topical, pulmonary, e.g., by inhalation or insufflation of powders or aerosols, including by nebulizer; intratracheal, intranasal, epidermal and transdermal, oral or parenteral.

Examples of such biologies include, biologies that target ILi p (e.g., anakinra), IL6 (tocilizumab), or TNF (etanercept, infliximab, adlimumab, or certolizumab). </p> Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compounds that exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred. </p> The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans.

For example, a dsRNA targeting a TTR gene can be useful for the treatment of a TTR amyloidosis, such as familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP), familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy (FAC), leptomeningeal/CNS amyloidosis, amyloidosis VII form (also known as leptomeningeal or meningocerebrovascular amyloidosis), hyperthyroxinemia, and cardiac amyloidosis (also called senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA) and senile cardiac amyloidosis (SCA)).

The crude sequences thus obtained were precipitated using acetone: ethanol mix and the pellet were re-suspended in 0.5M sodium acetate buffer. Samples from each sequence were analyzed by LC-MS and the resulting mass data confirmed the identity of the sequences. A selected set of samples were also analyzed by 1EX chromatography. </p> The next step in the process was purification. All sequences were purified on an AKTA explorer purification system using Source 15Q column. A single peak corresponding to the full length sequence was collected in the eluent and was subsequently analyzed for purity by ion exchange chromatography. </p> The purified sequences were desalted on a Sephadex G25 column using AKTA purifier. The desalted TTR sequences were analyzed for concentration and purity. The single strands were then annealed to form TTR-dsRNA. </p> Example 2B: In vitro screening of TTR siR As for mRNA suppression </p> Human TTR targeting dsRNAs (Table 2) were assayed for inhibition of endogenous TTR expression in HepG2 and Hep3B cells, using qPCR (real time PCR) and bDNA (branched DNA) assays to quantify TTR mRNA.

Duplexes without any mismatches are more likely to achieve significant knockdown of the target transcript than duplexes with mismatches between the oligo and the mRNA. To better enable interpretation of cross-species toxicology data and to have the broadest applicability to human patients, duplexes that have 100% identity in orthologous genes from rat, cynomolgus monkey and human, and that do not target regions with known polymorphisms are generally preferred. The five lead compounds were selected based on IC50 in hepatocyte cell lines in the pM range, the absence of immunostimulatory activity, specificity to the human TTR transcripts, and absence of known polymorphisms (mutations) in the region of the mRNA targeted by the duplex. In the case of TTR, no 19 base oligos were found with complete identity in human, rat and cynomolgus monkey.

LNP01-18328 and LNP01-18246 in transgenic mice </p> Two TTR siRNAs, AD- 18324 and AD-18328, were chosen for in vivo evaluation. These duplexes exhibited potent dose-dependent silencing in vitro in hepatocyte cell lines (e.g. </p> HepG2). FIG. 2A and FIG. 2B show the dose responses in HepG2 cells after transfection with AD- 18324 (FIG. 2A) or AD-18328 (FIG. 2B) where the doses are expressed in nM on the x-axis and the responses are expressed as fraction TTR mRNA remaining relative to control, on the y- axis. In HepG2 cells, the IC50s of AD- 18324 and AD-18328 were determined to be 2 pM and 3 pM, respectively. The TTR target sites for both lead dsRNA candidates are in the 3 ' untranslated region of the TTR mRNA, in a region where there are no reported mutations in the literature. </p> The sequences of each strand of the two lead candidates are reproduced below from the Tables. Strand: s= sense; as= antisense; Position: position of 5' base on transcript </p> NM 000371.2. </p></p>In addition, a rodent cross-reactive TTR dsRNA, AD- 18246, was chosen for further evaluation in vivo. AD- 18246 targets a sequence beginning at position 88 of the open reading frame, where there are three mutations reported in the literature. A dose response curve for AD- 18246 in HepG2 cells is shown in FIG. 3. AD- 18246 is substantially less potent than AD-18324 and AD-18328; the IC50 of AD- 18246 was determined to be 265 pM. </p> AD-18324, AD-18328, and AD-18246 were administered to transgenic mice after formulation in LNPOl . 3-5 month old H 129-mTTR-KO/iNO S -KO hTTR transgenic mice \n\n (mouse transthyretin knock-out/ inducible nitric oxide synthase knock-out/human transthyretin transgenic) were intravenously (IV) administered 200 \u03bc\u0390 of LNP01 -formulated transthyretin- specific siRNA (AD-18324, AD-18328, or AD-18246), LNP01 -formulated control siRNA targeting the non-mammalian luciferase gene (AD- 1955) or PBS via the tail vein at </p>concentrations of 1.0 mg/kg, 3.0 mg/kg, or 6.0 mg/kg for siRNAs AD-18324 and AD-18328, 3.0 mg kg for siRNA AD-18246, and 6.0 mg/kg for siRNA AD-1955. LNP01 is a lipidoid formulation comprised of ND98, Cholesterol, and PEG-Ceramide CI 6. </p> After approximately forty -hours, mice were anesthetized with 200 \u03bc\u0390 of ketamine, and then exsanguinated by severing the right caudal artery. Whole blood was isolated and plasma was isolated and stored at -80\u00b0C until assaying. Liver tissue was collected, flash-frozen and stored at -80\u00b0C until processing. </p> Efficacy of treatment was evaluated by (i) measurement of TTR mRNA in liver at 48 hours post-dose, and (ii) measurement of TTR protein in plasma at prebleed and at 48 hours post-dose.
