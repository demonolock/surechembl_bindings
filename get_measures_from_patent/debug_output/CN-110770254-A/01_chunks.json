    " of M or less<sub>D</sub>An antibody or antigen-binding fragment that binds to human c-Met. With the proviso that the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof is, for example, 5X 10<sup>-8</sup>K of M or less<sub>D</sub>\uff0c1\u00d710<sup>-8</sup>K of M or less<sub>D</sub>\uff0c5\u00d710<sup>-9</sup>K of M or less<sub>D</sub>Or 1X 10<sup>-9</sup>K of M or less<sub>D</sub>Binding to human c-Met, but not limited thereto.</p>In a particular embodiment of the invention, K is identified by identifying the binding affinity of hu8C4, hu8C4 AH71 and hu8C4 XPAD anti-scFv for C-Met ECD<sub>D</sub>The values are 3.173X 10 respectively<sup>-10</sup>\u30019.993\u00d710<sup>-11</sup>And 2.78X 10<sup>-10</sup>The antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof of the present invention were directly identified to have high binding affinity to c-Met antigen (table 22). Antibodies of the invention, or antigen-binding fragments thereof, were identified as cross-reactive to the c-Met antigen of cynomolgus macaques, a simian (table 22), but not binding to antigens derived from other animals, such as rodents (figure 9). Furthermore, it was identified that the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the present invention does not bind to other receptors on the cell surface other than c-Met (table 24). Thus, as can be seen from the above results, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the present invention showed binding specificity to the c-Met antigen of human and monkey.</p>As used herein, the term \"binding constant (K)<sub>on</sub>) \"refers to the binding ratio of a particular antibody-antigen interaction, and the term\" dissociation constant (K)<sub>off</sub>) \"refers to the dissociation ratio of a particular antibody-antigen interaction. Further, in the present invention, the term \"affinity for antigen (K)<sub>D</sub>) \"is a reaction of K<sub>off</sub>:K<sub>on</sub>Ratio of (i.e., K)<sub>off</sub>/K<sub>on</sub>) Expressed as molarityAffinity of degree (M). The limiting condition may be, K of the antibody<sub>D</sub>Values are measured using methods widely established in the art. E.g. as a K for measuring antibodies<sub>D</sub>Method of value, which can be determined by using Biocore<sup>TM</sup>Surface plasmon resonance analysis of the system is provided, but not limited thereto.</p>In another aspect of the invention, there are provided methods for producing a nucleic acid molecule encoding an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof, an expression vector comprising the nucleic acid molecule, a host cell having the expression vector introduced therein, and an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof using the host cell.</p>Such as the antibodies and antigen binding fragments thereof described above.</p>As used herein, the term \"nucleic acid molecule\" has the full meaning of DNA and RNA molecules, wherein nucleotides (the basic building blocks in nucleic acid molecules) include not only natural nucleotides, but also analogues in which the sugar or base portion is modified (Scheit, Nucleotide Analogs, John Wiley, New York (1980); Uhlman and Peyman, chemical reviews (1990)90: 543-.

    "r 1 hour at room temperature, anti-human IgG, F (ab')<sub>2</sub>Fragment specificThe hetero-HRP-conjugated antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch, 109-. Color development was performed by using TMB (Sigma, T4444) solution, in which the value thereof was measured at an optical density of 450nm, and the ELISA result thereof is shown in fig. 9.</p>As a result, it was identified that the hu8C4 monospecific antibody and the hu8C4 XPadrol single anti-scFv bispecific antibody did not bind to mouse C-Met and mouse EGFR, but bound to monkey and human C-Met and EGFR. In addition, it was identified that the human IgG antibody used as a negative control group did not bind at all. The above results indicate that the c-Met antibody of the present invention is specific only to human and monkey c-Met and EGFR.</p>Example 10 Cross-reactivity of c-Met antibodies with various receptors on cell surfaces</p>The specificity of hu8C4 antibody specifically binding to C-Met and its cross-reactivity with other receptor tyrosine kinase antigens according to the invention were analyzed by indirect ELISA method and 5 antigens FGF R3, VEGFR 2, IGF IR, PDGF R and RON were selected from key receptor tyrosine kinases for analysis.</p>In this example, human c-Met Fc chimera (R &amp; D systems,358-MT _ CF), human FGF R3(IIIc) Fc chimera (R &amp; D systems,766-FR), human IGF-I R (R &amp; D systems,391-GR-050), human PDGF R \u03b2 Fc chimera (R &amp; D systems,385-PR _ CF), human VEGF R2 Fc chimera (R &amp; D systems,357-KD _ CF) and human MSPR/Ron (R &amp; D systems,1947-MS-050) were used as antigens.</p>Each antigen was diluted at a concentration of 1 \u03bc g/ml in 0.05M carbonate-bicarbonate (Sigma, C3041) buffer, after which the resulting antigen was added to each well of a 96-well plate (Corning, #2592) so that the resulting plate was coated overnight at 4 \u2103. The plate was washed once with TBS-T, and thereafter TBS-T containing 4% skim milk was added in an amount of 200. mu.l to each well of the resulting plate to inhibit nonspecific binding, so that the resulting plate was reacted at 37 \u2103 for 1 hour. Subsequently, the plate was washed once with TBS-T buffer, after which the primary antibody was sequentially diluted from a maximum concentration of 30nM to 0.002nM in TBS-T buffer containing 2% skim milk so that the resulting antibody was added to 100 \u03bc l to each well, thereby reacting at 37 \u2103 for 2 hours. After washing three times with TBS-T buffer, anti-human kappa light chain-peroxidase (Sigma, A7164) was diluted at a ratio of 1:5000 as a secondary antibody, and thereafter the resulting antibody was added to 100. mu.l of each well to react at 37 \u2103 for 1 hour. Subsequently, after washing three times with TBS-T buffer, TMB solution (Sigma, T4444) was added to each well in 100 \u03bc l to perform color reaction, and thereafter 2N ammonium sulfate solution was added to each well in 50 \u03bc l to stop the reaction. The optical density was measured by using a microplate reader based on the value at a wave"
