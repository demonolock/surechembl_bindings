    "within the human variable region framework domains to enhance proper binding characteristics. Through humanizing antibodies, biological half-life may be increased, and the potential for adverse immune reactions upon administration to humans is reduced.</p>The term \u201cchimeric antibody\u201d or \u201cchimeric antibodies\u201d refers to antibodies whose light and heavy chain genes have been constructed, typically by genetic engineering, from immunoglobulin variable and constant region genes belonging to different species. For example, the variable segments of the genes from a mouse monoclonal antibody may be joined to human constant segments, such as gamma 1 and gamma 3. A typical therapeutic chimeric antibody is thus a hybrid protein composed of the variable or antigen-binding domain from a mouse antibody and the constant domain from a human antibody, although other mammalian species may be used.</p>As used herein, the term \u201cimmunoglobulin\u201d refers to a protein consisting of one or more polypeptides substantially encoded by immunoglobulin genes. One form of immunoglobulin constitutes the basic structural unit of an antibody. This form is a tetramer and consists of two identical pairs of immunoglobulin chains, each pair having one light and one heavy chain. In each pair, the light and heavy chain variable regions are together responsible for binding to an antigen, and the constant regions are responsible for the antibody effector functions.</p>Full-length immunoglobulin \u201clight chains\u201d (about 25 Kd or 214 amino acids) are encoded by a variable region gene at the NH2-terminus (about 110 amino acids) and a kappa or lambda constant region gene at the COOH-terminus. Full-length immunoglobulin \u201cheavy chains\u201d (about 50 Kd or 446 amino acids), are similarly encoded by a variable region gene (about 116 amino acids) and one of the other aforementioned constant region genes (about 330 amino acids). Heavy chains are classified as gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon, and define the antibody's isotype as IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE, respectively. Within light and heavy chains, the variable and constant regions are joined by a \u201cJ\u201d region of about 12 or more amino acids, with the heavy chain also including a \u201cD\u201d region of about 10 more amino acids. (See generally, Fundamental Immunology (Paul, W., ed., 2nd ed. Raven Press, N.Y., 1989), Ch. 7 (incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes).</p>An immunoglobulin light or heavy chain variable region consists of a \u201cframework\u201d region interrupted by three hypervariable regions. Thus, the term \u201chypervariable region\u201d refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody which are responsible for antigen binding. The hypervariable region comprises amino acid residues from a \u201cComplementarity Determining Region\u201d or \u201cCDR\u201d (i.e., residues 24-34 (L1), 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and 31-35 (H1), 50-65 (H2) and 95-102 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain (Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)) and/or those residues from a \u201chypervariable loop\u201d (i.e., residues 26-32 (L1), 50-52 (L2) and 91-96 (L3) in the light chain va",

Hybridoma pools yielding a specific positive result in the ELISA assay and positive results in either the FACS or \u201cneutralization assay\u201d are cloned at least two times by limiting dilution.</p>Five rat anti-mouse hybridomas were generated in a similar fashion and were given the following clone designations: clone 271.9.4.2.6, clone 271.26.6.6.1, clone 271.33.1.2.2, clone 271.33.3.2.1, and clone 271.39.4.6.5. See Example 1. The monoclonal antibodies produced by these clones were characterized in a number of ways including binning (i.e, determining if each antibody could inhibit the binding of any other binding), relative affinity, and neutralization. The monoclonal antibodies appear to fall into two separate bins with clone 271.33.3.2.1 binding to a separate epitope than the other four. Relative binding affinity for four of these monoclonal antibodies is described in Example 14.</p>Binding affinity of the monoclonal antibodies can be generated. Goat-anti-Rat IgG-Fc gamma specific Antibody (Jackson) is immobilized onto a CM5 Biacore chip. The assay is optimized to bind each mAb onto the anti-Rat capture surface and then a concentration series of IL-31 is injected across the mAb to see association (Ka) and dissociation (Kd). After each run, the surface is regenerated back to the anti-Rat Antibody with 2 injections of 20 mM HCl. Data is generated for each and evaluation software (BIAevaluation software version 3.2, Pharmacia BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden) is used to assess the kinetics of the anti-IL-31 antibody binding to the IL-31 protein</p>Murine anti-human Il-31 mAbs can be generated as follows. Six to twelve week old IL-31 knockout mice are immunized by intraperitoneal injection with 25-50 ug of soluble human IL-31-muFc protein) mixed 1:1 (v:v) with Ribi adjuvant (Sigma) on a biweekly schedule. Seven to ten days following the third immunization, blood samples are taken via retroorbital bleed, the serum harvested and evaluated for its ability to inhibit the binding of IL-31 in neutralization assays (e.g., described herein) and to stain IL-31 transfected versus untransfected 293 cells in a FACS staining assay. Mice continued to be immunized and blood samples taken and evaluated as described above until neutralization titers reaches a plateau. At that time, mice with the highest neutralization titers are injected intravascularly with 25-50 ug of soluble IL-31-Fc protein in PBS. Three days later, the spleen and lymph nodes from these mice are harvested and used for hybridoma generation, for example using mouse myeloma (P3-X63-Ag8.653.3.12.11) cells or other appropriate cell lines in the art, using standard methods known in the art (e.g., see Kearney, J.

The clones can be propogated by starting cultures at 2\u00d710<sup>5 </sup>cells/ml and maintaining between 1\u00d710<sup>5 </sup>and 5\u00d710<sup>5 </sup>cell/ml at 37\u00b0 C. and 5-6% CO. Cells can be adapted to serum free conditions upon subsequent transfers. Cells that are frozen are stored in 90% serum, 10% DMSO and stored in vapor phase of liquid nitrogen freezer.</p>Monoclonal antibodies in tissue culture media are characterized for their ability to block, inhibit, prevent, or reduce receptor binding when grown in the presence of the purified recombinant proteins human IL-31. For example, the monoclonal antibodies produced by these clones were characterized in a number of ways including binning (i.e, determining if each antibody could inhibit the binding of any other binding), relative affinity, and neutralization. The ten good neutralizing antibodies appear to be in the same bin, with the other monoclonal antibodies grouping into three separate bins. In addition, eight of the good neutralizing antibodies are IgG1 isotype and the other two are IgG2a isotype</p>Monoclonal antibodies from hybridoma supernatants were captured using goat goat anti murine Fc pAb and the apparent binding binding affinity (EC50) of biotinylated IL31 was measured. Under these assay conditions, the good neutralizers have the lowest and comparable EC50 values \u02dc4 ng/mL Bt-IL31. The apparent affinity of the weak neutralizers spans a range from \u02dc10 ng/mL to 236 ng/mL Bt-IL31.</p>Monoclonal antibodies generated by the methods described herein can be tested for neutralization by a variety of methods. For example the luciferase assay as described in published U.S. patent application (Seee publication number 20030224487, Sprecher, Cindy et al., 2003) can be used. In addition neutralization can be tested by measuring a decrease in the production of pro-inflammatory chemokines such as TARC and MDC from keratinocyte cultures in the presence of ligand and the monoclonal antibody. Neutralization can also be measured by the in vivo models described herein.</p>In one embodiment, the antibodies of the present invention are human antigen-binding antibody fragments of the present invention and include, but are not limited to, Fab, Fab\u2032 and F(ab\u2032)2, Fd, single-chain Fvs (scFv), single-chain antibodies, disulfide-linked Fvs (sdFv) and fragments comprising either a VL or VH domain.

Supernatant from high cell density cultures grown in Hybridoma-SFM was centrifuged to remove cells and cell debris, filtered through a 0.2 \u03bcm filter and the mAb purified by protein G chromatography using standard methods known in the art.</p>E. Ranking In Vitro Specific Neutralizing Activity of MAbs</p>To rank the in vitro specific neutralizing activity of each of the five rat anti-mouse IL-31 mAbs, each of the purified mAbs was retested in the cell-based neutralization assay described earlier with the exception that mIL-31 was first added to cells and this mixture then added to the antibodies. In addition to neutralizing activity against mIL-31-CEE, the mAbs were also evaluated against another form of mouse IL-31, termed c108smIL-31, in which the cysteine residue at position 108 had been converted to a serine residue. The latter material was produced in E. coli without the C-EE peptide. Both forms of mIL-31 were employed at a final concentration of 1 and 5 ng/mL. The mAbs were adjusted to a concentration of 20 ug/mL in assay media and tested in duplicate as serial 10-fold dilutions ranging from 10 ug/mL to 0.00001 ug/mL final concentration in the assay mixture. IC50 values were determined using Softmax software (Molecular Devices). Results are shown in Table 1 and show that mAbs 271.26.6.6.1, 271.33.1.2.2 and 271.39.4.6.5 were the most potent neutralizing mAbs and were of similar potency in this in vitro test. Interestingly, mAb 271.33.3.2.1 was much less effective than the other mAbs against the c108smIL-31 version of mIL-31 supporting the conclusion from the epitope binning studies that this antibody in all likelihood has a different epitope specificity than the other four mAbs. The fact that this mAb was also much less effective against the c108smIL-31 version of mIL-31 as compared to the mIL-31-CEE version suggests that the epitope recognized by 271.33.3.2.1 might partially involve a glycosylation site on the IL-31 molecule.</p>TABLE 1In Vitro Cell-Based Neutralization Activity of Rat Anti-Mouse IL-31 MAbsmIL-31Conc.IC50 (ng/mL) for mAbsversion(ng/mL)271.9.4.2.6271.26.6.6.1271.33.1.2.2271.33.3.2.1271.39.4.6.5mIL31-CEE1113213253014133612c108smIL311961171248951904333255140</p>Example 2Generation of Mouse Anti-Human IL-31 mAbsA. Immunization and Serum Screening of Mice</p>Two groups of six to eight week old female BALB/c mice, five animals each, were immunized with human IL-31. Mice in Group 1 were immunized by intraperitoneal injection of purified, recombinant human IL-31 fused at the C-terminal with a peptide consisting of the sequence EYMPME (SEQ ID NO: 7) (hereafter referred to as IL-31-CEE) in combination with Ribi adjuvant as per manufacturer's instructions. This protein was produced in BHK cells. Mice in Group 2 were similarly immunized with a purified, recombinant, mutated form of human IL-31 in which the cysteine residue at position 108 had been converted to a serine residue (hereafter referred to as c108sIL-31). This material was produced in E. coli without the C-EE peptide. All mice received 50 ug of protein every two weeks for a 10 week period. Seven to ten days after the third and fourth immunizations the mice were bled via the retroorbital plexus and the serum separated from the blood for analysis of its ability to inhibit the binding and subsequent stimulatory activity of human IL-31 to a cell line transfected with the human IL-RA.</p>The ability of the individual antisera to inhibit human IL-31 was assessed using a luciferase based neutralization assay employing IL-31-CEE or",
    "94.154, 294.155, 294.158 and 294.163) whose supernatant poorly neutralized IL-31-CEE in the neutralization assay (less than 50% but preferably only 1-20%) and also bound relatively well to IL-31-CEE in solution (as noted by an OD of greater than 2.0 at neat concentration of supernatant). Cloning, screening of clones, and selection of a best first round clone was performed as described above for the potent neutralizing wells.</p>To reduce the number of hybridomas going into further subcloning, two new assays were performed with exhausted supernatant from each of the selected first round clones. The first assessment was an attempt to group the mAbs on the basis of epitope specificity (\u201cbinning\u201d) using the Biacore 3000 surface plasmon resonance instrument. One of the good neutralizing mAb supernatants (292.64.6) and the 10 poorer neutralizing first round clone supernatants were run against each other and resulted in the identification of four apparent \u201cbins\u201d. Bin 1 consisted of the good neutralizing antibody only. Bin 2 was comprised of 292.152.4, 292.154.4, 294 35.2, 294.146.5 and 294.154.5. Bin 3 included 291.78.4, 294.155.6, 294.158.5 and 294.163.2. Bin 4 contained only 294.144.3. The second assay involved a repeat of the \u201ccapture\u201d style ELISA only this time, because of higher specific antibody concentration in the supernatants as compared to the original master 24 well culture supernatants, a more complete titration curve was obtained and allowed for the determination of an EC50 for antibody binding to IL-31-CEE. Results are shown in Table 3 (along with the binning results and the % inhibition of IL-31-CEE activity in the cell-based neutralization assay) and indicated that there was a wide range in EC50 values (and by inference, affinity of the mAbs for IL-31-CEE) for the various mAbs.</p>TABLE 3Summary Data for First Round Clone Culture Supernatantfrom Less Potent IL-31 Neutralizing Hybridomas% NeutralizationEC<sub>50 </sub>(ng/mL)of IL31 activity inEpitope Binfor capturecell-based assayMAb(Biacore)of IL31-CEE(undiluted supernate)291.78.431094292.152.4218225292.154.4257.776294.35.2222.282294.144.3413.475294.146.5210.294294.154.5215.888294.155.6317253294.158.5311931294.163.2324.247292.64.613.4100</p>With emphasis on selection of hybridomas producing mAbs that were 1) in epitope bins different from that of a good neutralizing mAb (292.64.6) and 2) of highest affinity as indicated by a low EC50 in the capture style assay, only first round clones 294.35.2, 294.144.3, 294.154.5 and 294.163.2 were brought to final clone status as described above for the more potent neutralizing mAbs.

All four mAbs were found to belong to the IgG1 subclass. Samples of each of the four hybridomas were deposited with the American Type Tissue Collection (ATCC, Manassas, Va.) patent depository as an original deposit under the Budapest Treaty and were given the following ATCC Accession No.s: clone 294.163.2.1 (ATCC Patent Deposit Designation PTA-6831); clone 294.35.2.6.3 (ATCC Patent Deposit Designation PTA-6872); clone 294.154.5.6 ATCC Patent Deposit Designation PTA-6875); and clone 294.144.3.5 (ATCC Patent Deposit Designation PTA-6873).</p>G. Cross-Reaction of Mouse Anti-Human IL-31 mAbs with mouse IL-31</p>All first round clone supernatants from the ten potent neutralizing mAbs as well as the ten less potent neutralizing mAbs were tested for their ability to recognize mouse IL-31 by ELISA on plate bound mIL-31-CEE.

    "31-mAb #2 complex, streptavidin-HRP (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.) was added to the plate at 0.5 \u03bcg/mL. The plates were developed with TMB substrate (BioFX Laboratories, Owings Mills, Md.), and the absorbance of the individual wells at 450 nm was measured with a plate reader (Molecular Devices SpectraMax340, Sunnyvale, Calif.). If mAb #1 recognized a different epitope from mAb #2, the biotin-rIL31-mAb #2 complex bound to the plate resulting in a high absorbance reading. If mAb #1 recognized the same epitope as mAb #2, the biotin-rIL31-MAb #2 complex did not bind to the plate resulting in a low absorbance reading.</p>Results: The full panel of 21 mAbs were tested against themselves simultaneously in a series of six 96-well microtiter plates. Absorbance values at 450 nm (A450 nm) were recorded for each combination and orientation and compiled. In all cases, low absorbance values were obtained for the self-self combinations. In addition to the self-self control, a positive control of 50 ng/mL rIL31-biotin (without competing mAb #2) was tested using each primary mAb on every plate. Two positive control samples were obtained for each primary mAb, and the values of the duplicate samples were similar. The absorbance values obtained from the positive control wells (without mAb #2) for 9 of the 11 weakly neutralizing mAbs (from bins 2, 3, or 4) were less that the absorbance values measured for the control samples for the remaining mAbs. Presumably this was due to the lower affinity (higher EC50) for those mAbs. To facilitate the interpretation of the results, the absorbance values were normalized so that the maximum absorbance measured for any combination of mAbs across a row (capture mAb (mAb #1) held constant) was assigned a value of 100%. The normalized values fell into two distinct groups: A large cluster of values fell below a value of 32% consistent with competition, and a second large cluster of values fell above 32% consistent with a lack of competition. The 32% threshold value was used to assign each combination and orientation of mAbs to one of two discrete categories (non-competition, and competition). Using the categorized data, binning was performed automatically based on a hierarchical clustering algorithm. As was observed during the binning experiments using the Biacore, some pairs of mAbs categorized differently depending on which mAb was used as the primary mAb. A high level of stringency, requiring competition in both orientations, was used to assign the mAbs to primary bins. Subsequently a less stringent criteria, requiring competition in one orientation only, was used to aid in the assignment of the mAbs to sub-bins based on minor differences in behavior. The normalized data was grouped according to the 5 primary bin assignments based on the high stringency criteria. Additionally, the combinations and orientations of mAbs are color coded (white for competition and dark for non-competition) to aid in visualizng the interactions that led to th",

Microtiter plates were coated at 100 \u03bcL/well with 1 \u03bcg/mL of a goat anti-mouse IgG Fc-\u03b3 specific antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch #115-005-071) diluted in ELISA B (PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 1% BSA). After binding of this coating antibody for 3 hours at ambient temperature, each purified monoclonal antibody supernatant was diluted in ELISA B to yield and approximate mAb concentration of 1 \u03bcg/mL and allowed to bind to the plate for 1 hour at ambient temperature. A serial dilutions of biotinylated rIL31 antigen were prepared from 500 ng/mL to 0 ng/mL in ELISA B and added to the wells. After incubation with the biotinylated antigen, streptavidin-HRP (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.) at 0.5 \u03bcg/mL was added to the plate. The plates were developed with TMB substrate (BioFX Laboratories, Owings Mills, Md.), and the absorbance of the individual wells at 450 nm was measured with a plate reader (Molecular Devices SpectraMax340, Sunnyvale, Calif.). Duplicate points were averaged and the data was analyzed with a four-parameter fit. The \u201cC\u201d value of the 4 parameter fit is reported as the apparent EC50 (ng/mL) and is the biotin-rIL31 concentration that produces a half-maximal response in the assay.</p>Results: Four-parameter fits were obtained from the experimental curves for all 21 of the mAbs. The concentration of biotin-rIL31 producing half-maximal response (EC50) in the assay ranged from 3.3 to 236 ng/mL, with all 10 of the strongly neutralizing mAbs exhibiting low and comparable EC50 values (3.3-4.4 ng/mL).</p>D.

The rIL31 antigen was mixed with either reducing or non-reducing sample buffer, heated at 70\u00b0 C. for 10 min then loaded at 100 ng/lane on 4-12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). Molecular weight standards were SeeBlue (Invitrogen), and electrophoresis was performed in 1\u00d7 MES running buffer (Invitrogen). Protein bands in the gels were transferred to 0.2 \u03bcm nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen) and blocked overnight in 2.5% non-fat dried milk in Western A buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Igepal, 0.25% gelatin).
