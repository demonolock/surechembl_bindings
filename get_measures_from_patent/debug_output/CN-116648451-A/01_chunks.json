Because of the close proximity of the donor and acceptor in the binding event, the binding of the fluorescent-labeled adenosine acceptor antagonist XAC (CA 200645, FRET acceptor) to terbium-labeled A1, A2a, A2b and A3 adenosine acceptors (FRET donors) was detected by time-resolved FRET. To investigate the ability of unlabeled test compounds to bind to adenosine A1, A2a, A2b and A3 receptors, dose response curves were constructed to determine a range of concentrations that inhibited the ability of 30nm ca200645 to bind to A2b receptors and 100nm ca200645 to bind to A1, A2a and A3 receptors. </p>Test compounds were serially diluted (1:3 dilution) in pure DMSO using moquito (TTP Labtech company, uk) and 400nL of test compound samples were transferred to assay plates. Compound samples were incubated at room temperature with a fixed concentration of CA200645 (see above) defined for each receptor and CHO cell membranes containing human adenosine A1 (0.5 \u03bcg/well), A2a (0.3 \u03bcg/well), A2b (1 \u03bcg/well) or A3 (1 \u03bcg/well) receptors in 40 \u03bcl assay buffer for 2 hours. The total binding and non-specific binding of CA200645 were measured in the absence and presence of 10 \u03bcmxac, respectively. After 2 hours incubation, CA200645 binding levels were detected on Pherastar FSX (BMG Labtech, germany) using a standard TR-FRET set-up. The terbium donor was excited by three laser flashes of wavelength 337nm, and donor and acceptor emissions were detected at wavelengths of 620nm and 665nm, respectively. FRET ratio is obtained by multiplying the acceptor/donor ratio value by 10,000. Specific binding is determined by subtracting the non-specific binding FRET ratio from the total binding FRET ratio.
