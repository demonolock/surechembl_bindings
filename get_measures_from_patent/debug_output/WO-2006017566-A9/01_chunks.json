These results infer that I<sub>f</sub> is indeed a crucial oscillator of the membrane potential. This finding provides new insights into the functional role of I<sub>f</sub> in pacing (cardiac, neuronal and pancreatic). To date, at least three approaches have been taken to induce ectopic pacemaker activity in the heart. These include overexpression of \u03b2<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor in the atria<sup>30</sup> and genetic suppression of ventricular I\u03bai<sup>21</sup>'<sup>22</sup>. Specifically, somatic gene transfer of the dominant-negative construct Kir2.1-AAA in adult guinea pig ventricular myocytes suppressed I\u03bai expression (by -80%), leading to the conversion of : quiescent ventricular muscle cells into spontaneously-active \"pacemaker-like\" cells in<sup>1</sup> a manner analogous to the Ad-HCNl -\u0394\u0394\u0394-transduced cells described in this study. However, Kir2.1AAA-induced ventricular automaticity, similar to that caused by Ba<sup>2+</sup> blockade of I<sub>K1</sub>, was much slower than the normal heart rate. In other words, I<sub>K1</sub> suppression by Kir2.1-AAA acts as a simple on-and-off switch to unleash latent pacemaking activity of otherwise quiescent ventricular cells. However, it does not provide a direct means to modulate the induced firing activity. Our present results implicates that ectopic cardiac pacing can be better achieved by modulating a genuine pacemaker current - I<sub>f</sub>, rather than suppressing the inhibitor I<sub>KI</sub>.</p>\n  Previous attempts to reproduce nodal I<sub>f</sub> in ventricular myocytes by overexpressing WT HCN2 alone, however, failed to induce automaticity<sup>28</sup>. By contrast, overexpression of the same channels in the left atrium or the left bundle branch could induce pacemaking function but only after vagal stimulation-induced sinus arrest<sup>19</sup>, limiting any potential useful therapeutic applications. Since I<sub>R1</sub> and I<sub>f</sub>, stabilizer and oscillator of the membrane potential, are presumed to oppose each other, the differences observed in these experiments could be attributed to the higher expression levels of \n\nI<sub>K1</sub> in the ventricles than in the atria<sup>31</sup>. It is also likely that the Vy<sub>2</sub> and/or the magnitude of the expressed I<sub>f</sub> in these HCN2 experiments (-96 mV and ~0.8 pA/pF vs. 53.8 mV and 8.2\u00b11.4 pA/pF at -14OmV in our case) were below the thresholds required to cause active pacing in the presence of I\u03bai, a notion supported by our present results (see later)</p>\n  Interestingly, I<sub>f</sub> overexpression induces a faster pacing rate without Ba block of I<sub>R1</sub>- Perhaps, I<sub>K1</sub> hyperpolarizes the MDP, resulting in a higher probability of opening of the hyperpolarization-activated I<sub>f</sub> during early phase-4 depolarization. Therefore, the approaches of I<sub>f</sub> overexpression and IR<sub>1</sub> suppression to induce pacing are not necessarily synergistic. Rather, the"
