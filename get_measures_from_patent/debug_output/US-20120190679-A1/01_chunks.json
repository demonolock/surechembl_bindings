    "s backfilled with Dimethyl Sulphoxide (DMSO) to a total volume of 120 nl, such that when the enzyme and substrate mix was added the final DMSO concentration was 1%. DMSO was added to max control wells as 120 nl, minimum control wells were treated with 120 nl of compound at a concentration that inhibited the enzyme activity 100%.</p>Following addition of compound or control to the assay plate, 6 \u03bcl peptide mix containing 3 \u03bcM substrate (5-FAM-GRPRTSSFAEG-CONH2; CRB) and 40 \u03bcM ATP in Kinase base buffer (100 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 0.015% Brij-35) and 6 \u03bcl enzyme mix containing 8 nM AKT1/PKB\u03b1 active enzyme (Upstate Biotechnology, Cat No. 14-276), 8 mM DTT and 20 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>in kinase base buffer was added. All buffers were made up with 18M\u03a9 water. The plates were sealed and incubated at room temperature for 50 minutes. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 \u03bcl stop buffer (100 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 0.015% Brij-35 solution, 0.1% coating reagent #3, 40 mM EDTA, 5% DMSO) to each well (N.B. plates can be frozen after stopping and read later). The plates were then analysed using the Caliper LabChip LC3000 Drug Discovery System (Caliper Life Sciences, 1 Wellfield, Preston Brook, Runcorn, WA7 3AZ) using the following separation conditions; \u22121.8 PSI, \u2212500 upstream voltage, \u22121700 downstream voltage, sample sip time of 0.2 sec, post sample sip time of 30 sec and a final delay of 120 sec. Integration of the substrate and product peaks was carried out using Caliper LabChip software and IC50 curves were calculated using Origin\u2122 software (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, Mass., USA). Examples of the invention were tested in the in vitro AKT1 enzyme assay and the mean IC<sub>50 </sub>values obtained are presented in Table G.</p>TABLE GCellular PKB MeanIn vitro PKB\u03b1 MeanExample NumberIC<sub>50 </sub>(\u03bcM)IC<sub>50 </sub>(\u03bcM)\u200210.20.0076\u200220.130.0038\u200230.140.00673A, 3B0.11, &gt;3.100.0026, 0.27\u200240.230.005\u200250.270.0097\u200260.020.0012\u200270.140.00617A, 7B0.10, &gt;3.100.0045, 0.24\u200280.30.0071\u200290.090.0032100.250.0042110.10.00211A, 11B0.11, 0.48\u2002\u20020.0028, 0.021120.10.0027130.090.0042140.940.00315&gt;3.100.093164.60.28170.240.012181.40.016190.260.011200.980.02*21&gt;3.100.059*220.170.0075230.080.0013240.060.0022250.130.0029260.090.0056270.370.016*280.470.0045291.60.041301.10.03311.10.024320.420.012330.240.014340.350.0092350.280.004360.380.014370.550.019380.360.0054391.90.05401.90.032410.540.016424.30.032430.870.031441.80.0089450.770.23466.70.15470.210.0036480.160.0056490.0810.00549A, 49B0.077, 1.2\u2002\u2003\u20020.0033, 0.048500.190.0043510.310.01520.0780.003753&gt;2.40.0063540.180.0034550.0430.00395610.016570.490.012582.90.031590.840.0063600.470.023610.850.023620.560.028630.680.042640.30.0095650.870.0064660.990.0066*670.890.0077*680.340.012690.410.0069*= tested once only\nhERG Analysis\n</p>Cell CultureThe hERG-expressing Chinese hamster ovary K1 (CHO) cells described by (Persson, Carlsson, Duker, &amp; Jacobson, 2005) were grown to semi-confluence at 37\u00b0 C. in a humidified environment (5% "
