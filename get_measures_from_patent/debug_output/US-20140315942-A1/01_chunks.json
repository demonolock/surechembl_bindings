    "use ears, flanks and footpads, no changes were observed compared to untreated or placebo-treated skin, suggesting little or no irritation (data not shown).</p>Example 5Effect of mTOR Inhibitors on Ribosomal ProteinNext-generation mTOR inhibitors have similar effects on ribosomal protein S6-phosphoylation (p-S6) when compared to rapamycin. Human HaCaT keratinocytes growing in serum (\u201cSerum\u201d) were treated with rapamycin or the other indicated mTOR inhibitors for the indicated times and then subjected to western blot analysis (Top) as in FIG. 2A. Also shown are keratinocytes that were serum-starved (ss) for 14 hours. These results indicate that serum starvation or treatment with mTOR inhibitors has a similar effect on S6 phosphorylation. The p-S6 levels were quantified and the ratio of p-S6 to total S6 (total S6 data not shown) was graphed in FIG. 2B in similar fashion to FIG. 1. Inhibition of S6 phosphorylation indicates that the mTOR pathway has been inhibited as S6 phosphorylation is downstream of mTOR, the target of rapamycin.</p>Example 6Rapamycin Distribution in Human Explant Skin 16 Hours after Application of Rapamycin FormulationTo test delivery of rapamycin from a formulation similar to that disclosed in Example 2, the formulation was applied to explant human skin. FIG. 3 shows the depth profile analysis of the distribution of rapamycin upon topical delivery into human skin, demonstrating rapamycin concentrations present within the epidermis (and dermis) well above the IC50 value required to inhibit S6 phosphorylation in cell culture. This testing demonstrates the efficacy of the disclosed formulations.</p>It should be understood that the above-described various types of compositions, are only illustrative of preferred embodiments of the present invention. Numerous modifications and alternative arrangements may be devised by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention and the appended claims are intended to cover such modifications and arrangements. Thus, while the present invention has been described above with particularity and detail in connection with what is presently deemed to be the most practical and preferred embodiments of the invention, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that variations including, may be made without departing from the principles and concepts set forth herein.</p>"
