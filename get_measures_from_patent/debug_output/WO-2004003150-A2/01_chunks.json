When expressed in HEK293 cells, the cRGM-AP fusion protein was processed proteolytically to yield a 110 kDa fusion protein (data not shown). This material retained biological activity as demonstrated by the avoidance of cRGM-AP stripes by temporal retinal ganglion cell axons (Fig. 1 A).</p>The cRGM-AP fusion protein does not bind to COS-7 kidney-derived cells, so we expressed an adult mouse brain cDNA expression library in these cells and screened for clones driving expression of cell surface binding activity. Only a single clone was identified in screens of 480,000 independent clones. This cDNA clone expressed a saturable binding site for cRGM-AP with a Kd of 230 pM (Fig. 1B-D). DNA sequence analysis revealed that the high affinity RGM-AP binding protein was Neogenin. In the mouse genome there are three RGM-related sequences, that we have termed mRGM-A, mRGM-B and mRGM-C. The three mouse RGM sequences share 41-49% aa identity and 55-61% aa similarity with one another. Chick RGM shares the highest level of identity with mRGM-A at 80% aa identity and 84% aa similarity. Both RGM-A and RGM-B are expressed in many regions of the developing mouse brain, so we tested if AP fusion proteins of these also bind to Neogenin. Both mRGM-A and mRGM-B bind mNeogenin with high affinity (Fig. IE).</p>To verify that the RGM interaction with Neogenin was due to their participation in a physical complex, RGM and Neogenin were co-expressed in HEK293T cells and analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation. RGM precipitates contained detectable Neogenin but control immunoprcipitates did not (Fig. 2A). More relevant for in vivo activity, affinity chromatography using the RGM-AP protein isolated Neogenin protein from adult mouse brain tissue (Fig.2B).</p>The RGM interaction with Neogenin raises several issues of specificity since Neogenin has been described previously as a Netrin binding protein<sup>4</sup>. RGM and \n\nNetrin-1 show no significant sequence similarity<sup>3</sup>. It should be noted that the reported Netrin binding affinity to Neogenin (~2nM)is an order of magnitude less than the RGM affinity (230pM). We considered whether RGM-AP binds to other ",
    "ogenin deletion mutant comprising the extracellular domain (truncated immediately N-terminal to the transmembrane region) is subcloned into a 293 expression vector (pCEP4: In Nitrogen).</p>Transfection: 293 EB\u039dA cells are transfected (CaPO.sub.4 method) with the receptor mutant expression construct. After 24 h recovery, transfected cells are selected with G418 (geneticin, 250 ug/ml, Gibco) and hygromycin (200 ug/ml). Once the selection process is complete, cells are maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagles medium (DME)/10% FCS under selection.</p>Preparation of Conditioned Medium: Serum-containing media is replaced with Optimem with glutamax-1 (Gibco) and 300 ng/ml heparin (Sigma), and the cells are conditioned for 3 days. The media is collected and spun at 3,000.times.g for 10 minutes. The supernatant is filtered (0.45 um) and stored with 0.1% azide at 4.degree. C. for no more than 2 weeks. \n\nIII. Transfect COS Cells</p>Seed COS cells (250,000) on 35 mm dishes in 2 ml DME/10% FCS. 18-24 h later, dilute 1 ug of netrin receptor-encoding DNA (cDNA cloned into pMT21 expression vector) into 200 ul serum-free media and add 6 ul of Lipofectamine (Gibco). Incubate this solution at room temperature for 15-45 min.</p>Wash the cells 2X with PBS. Add 800 ul serum-free media to the tube containing the lipid-DNA complexes. Overlay this solution onto the washed cells.</p>Incubate for 6 h. Stop the reaction by adding 1 ml DMA/20% FCS. Refeed cells.</p>Assay cells 12 hr later.</p>IV. Ligand Binding Assay</p>Wash plates of transfected COS cells IX with cold PBS (plus Ca/Mg)/1% goat serum.</p>Add 1 ml conditioned media neat and incubate 90 min at room temp.</p>Wash plates 3X with PBS (plus Ca/Mg). On the 4th wash, add 1 ml 50% methanol to</p>1 ml PBS. Then add 1 ml methanol. Evacuate and add 1 ml methanol.</p>Wash IX with PBS. Wash IX PBS/1% goat serum.</p>Add secondary antibody (l-to-2,000 anti-human Fc conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Jackson Lab)) in PBS/1% goat serum. Incubate 30-40 min room temp.</p>Wash 3X with PBS. Wash IX alkaline phosphatase buffer (100 mM Tris-Cl, pH 9.5,</p>100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl). Prepare alkaline phosphatase reagents: 4.5 ul/ l NBT and 3.5 ul/ml BCLP (Gibco) in alkaline phosphatase buffer.</p>Incubate 10-30 min, quench with 20 mM EDTA in PBS. Cells that have bound RGM are visible by the presence of a dark purple reaction product.</p>In parallel incubations, positive controls are provided by titrating RGM binding with serial dilutions of the mutant receptor conditioned medium.</p>V. Results: Binding of RGM to Neogenin</p>Cell expressing mammalian RGM were shown to bind Neogenin. No reactivity was observed with control COS cells or with receptor-expressing COS cells in the presence of the secondary antibody but in the absence of the RGM-Fc fusion. Binding was observed to receptor-expression cells using a construct in which RGM is fused directly to alkaline phosphatase, for which a secondary antibody is not required. Neogenin deletion"
