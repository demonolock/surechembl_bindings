    "., U.S. Pat. No. 4,855,231. All of the P. pastoris manipulations were performed essentially as described in Stroman, D. W. et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,855,231.</p>\n  About 1 microgram of pYAM7SP-NAP5 plasmid DNA was electroporated into the strain GTS115 using a standard electroporation protocol. The plasmid was previously linearized by SalI digestion, which theoretically facilitates the targeting and integration of the plasmid into the his4 chromosomal locus.</p>\n  The selection of a AcaNAP5 high-expressor strain was performed essentially as described hereinbelow. His+transformants were recovered on MD plates (Yeast Nitrogen Base without amino acids (DIFCO), 13.4 g/l; Biotin, 400 micrograms/L; D-glucose, 20 g/l; agar, 15 g/l). Single colonies (n=60) originating from the electroporation were inoculated into 100 microliters of FM22-glycerol-PTM1 medium in wells of a 96-well plate and were allowed to grow on a plate-agitator at 30\u00b0 C. for 24 hours. One liter of FM22-glycerol-PTM1 medium contained 42.87 g KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 5 g (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 1 g CaSO<sub>4</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O, 14.28 g K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 11.7 g MgSO<sub>4</sub>.7H<sub>2</sub>O, 50 g glycerol sterilized as a 100 ml solution, and 1 ml of PTM1 trace mineral mix filter-sterilized. The FM22 part of the medium was prepared as a 900 ml solution adjusted to pH 4.9 with KOH and sterile filtered. One liter of the PTM1 mix contained 6 g CuSO<sub>4</sub>.5H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.8 g KI, 3 g MnSO<sub>4</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.2 g NaMoO<sub>4</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.02 g H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>, 0.5 g COCl<sub>2</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O, 20 g ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 ml H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 65 g FeSO<sub>4</sub>.7H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.2 g biotin.</p>\n  The cells were then pelleted and resuspended in fresh FM22-methanol-PTM1 medium (same composition as above except that the 50 g glycerol was replaced by 0.5% (v/v) methanol in order to induce expression of the AOX1 promoter). After an additional incubation period of 24 hours at 30\u00b0 C., the supernatants of the mini-cultures were tested for the presence of secreted AcaNAP5. Two clones that directed a high level of synthesis and secretion of AcaNAP5, as shown by the appearance of high factor Xa inhibitory activity in the culture medium (as measured by the amidolytic factor Xa assay described in Example 1), were selected. After a second screening round, using the same procedure, but this time at the shake-flask level, one isolated host cell was chosen and designated P. pastoris GTS115/7SP-NAP5.</p>\n  The host cell, GTS115/7SP-NAP5, was shown to have a wild type methanol-utilisation phenotype (Mut<sup>+</sup>), which demonstrated that the integration of the expression cassette into the chromosome of GTS115 did not alter the functionality of the genomic AOX1 gene.</p>\n  Subsequent production of recombinant AcaNAP5 material was performed in shake flask cultures, as described in Stroman, D. W. et al., U.S. Pat. No.",
    "0% acetonitrile/200 mM NaCl, and the eluate was dialyzed or diafiltered as before.</p>\n  The eluate was adjusted to 0.1% TFA, applied to a Vydac C18 protein/peptide reverse phase column at ambient temperature, and eluted using 0.1% TFA/19% acetonitrile, followed by 0.1% TFA/25% acetonitrile, at a flow rate of 7 ml/min. NAP was detected in and recovered from the 0.1% TFA/25% acetonitrile elution.</p>\n  (B) AcaNAPc2 and AcaNAPc2P</p>\n  AcaNAPc2 or AcaNhPc2P can be purified as described above with the following protocol modifications. After thawing and diluting the media to achieve a conductivity below 8 mS, the pH of the AcaNAPc2-containing media was adjusted to pH 5.0 using NaOH. The filtered media was applied to a Pharmacia Q Fast Flow column, at a flow rate of 60 ml/min at ambient temperature, and the column was washed with 10 column volumes of 50 mM acetic acid, pH 5.0. Step elution was performed with 100 mM NaCl, 250 mM NaCl, and then 1000 ml NaCl, all in 50 mM acetic acid, pH 5.0. PT activity was detected in the 250 mM NaCl eluate. The total eluate was dialyzed until the conductivity was below 8 mS, and the protocol outlined above was followed using sulfoethyl aspartamide and RP-HPLC chromatography.</p>\n  Example A\n  Factor Xa Amidolytic Assay.</p>\n  The ability of NAPs of the present invention to act as inhibitors of factor Xa catalytic activity was assessed by determining the NAP-induced inhibition of amidolytic activity catalyzed by the human enzyme, as represented by Ki* values.</p>\n  The buffer used for all assays was HBSA (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM sodium chloride, 0.1% bovine serum albumin). All reagents were from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, Mo.), unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n  The assay was conducted by combining in appropriate wells of a Corning microtiter plate, 50 microliters of HBSA, 50 microliters of the test NAP compound diluted (0.025-25 nM) in HBSA (or HBSA alone for uninhibited velocity measurement), and 50 microliters of the Factor Xa enzyme diluted in HBSA (prepared from purified human factor X obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, Ind.) according to the method described by Bock, P. E. et al., Archives of Biochem. Biophys. 273:375 (1989). The enzyme was diluted into HBSA prior to the assay in which the final concentration was 0.5 nM). Following a 30 minute incubation at ambient temperature, 50 microliters of the substrate S2765 (N-alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-D-argininyl-L-glycyl-L-arginine-p-nitroanilide dihydrochloride,obtained from Kabi Diagnostica (or Kabi Pharmacia Hepar Inc., Franklin, Ohio) and made up in deionized water followed by dilution in HBSA prior to the assay) were added to the wells yielding a final total volume of 200 microliters and a final concentration of 250 micromolar (about 5-times Km). The initial velocity of chromogenic substrate hydrolysis was measured by the change in absorbance at 405 nm using a Thermo Max\u00ae Kinetic Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Palo alto, CA) over a 5 minute period in which less than 5% of the added substrate was utilized.</p>\n  Ratios of inhibited pre-equilibrium, steady-state velocities containing NAP (Vi) to the uninhibited velocity of free fXa alone (V<sub>o</sub>) were plotted against the corresponding concentrations of NAP. These data were then directly fit to an equation for tight-binding inhibitors (Morrison, J. F., and Walsh, C. T., Adv. Enzymol. 61:201-300 (1988)], from which the apparent equilibrium dissociation inhibitory constant K<sub>i</sub>* was calculated.</p>\n  Table 1 below gives the Ki* values for the test compounds AcaNAP5 [SEQ. ID. NO. 4], AcaNAP6 [SEQ. ID. NO. 6], and AcaNAPc2 [SEQ, ID. NO. 59], prepared as described in Examples 3, 4, and 15, respectively. The data show the utility of AcaNAP5 and AcaNAP6 as potent in vitro inhibitors of human FXa. In contrast, AcaNAPc2 did not effectively inhibit FXa amidolytic activity indicating that it does not affect the catalytic activity of free fXa.</p>\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n            \n              \n              TABLE 1\n            \n            \n              \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              Compound\n              Ki* (pM)\n            \n            \n              \n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              \n              AcaNAP5\n              \u200243 \u00b1 5\n            \n            \n              \n              AcaNAP6\n              996 \u00b1 65\n            \n            \n              \n              AcaNAPc2\n              NI<sup>a</sup>\n            \n            \n              \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              <sup>a</sup>NI = no inhibition; a maximum of 15% inhibition was observed up to 1 \u03bcM. \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  </p>\n  Example B\n  Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) Assays.</p>\n  The ex vivo anticoagulant effects of NAPs of the present invention in human plasma were evaluated by measuring the prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and prothrombin time (PT) over a broad concentration range of each inhibitor.</p>\n  Fresh frozen pooled normal citrated human plasma was obtained from George King Biomedical, Overland Park, Kans.

The amidolytic activity of the generated thrombin is measured simultaneously using a chromogenic substrate. Purified human FVa was obtained from Haematologic Technologies, Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). Purified human prothrombin was purchased from Celsus Laboratories, Inc. (Cincinnati, Ohio). The chromogenic substrate Pefachrome t-PA (CH<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>2</sub>-D-hexahydrotyrosine-glycyl-L-arginine-p-nitroanilide) from Pentapharm Ltd (Basel, Switzerland) was purchased from Centerchem, Inc. (Tarrytown, N.Y.). The substrate was reconstituted in deionized water prior to use.</p>\n  Phospholipid vesicles were made, consisting of phosphotidyl choline (67%, w/v), phosphatidyl glycerol (16%, w/v), phosphatidyl ethanolamine (10%, w/v), and phosphatidyl serine (7%, w/v) in the presence of detergent, as described by Ruf et al. [Ruf, W., Miles, D. J., Rehemtulla, A., and Edgington, T. S. Methods in Enzymology 222: 209-224 (1993)]. The phospholipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, (Alabaster, Ala.).</p>\n  The prothrombinase complex was formed in a polypropylene test tube by combining FVa, FXa, and phospholipid vesicles (PLV) in HBSA containing 3 mM CaCl<sub>2 </sub>for 10 min. In appropriate wells of a microtiter plate, 50 \u03bcl of the complex were combined with 50 \u03bcl o",
    "n, containing human prothrombin and the chromogenic substrate for thrombin, Pefachrome tPA. The final concentration of reactants in a total volume of 150 \u03bcL of HBSA was: NAP (0.025-25 nM), FXa (25.0 fM), PLV (5 \u03bcM), prothrombin (250 nM), Pefachrome tPA (250 \u03bcM, 5\u00d7Km), and CaCl<sub>2 </sub>(3 mM).</p>\n  The prothrombinase activity of fXa was measured as an increase in the absorbance at 405 nm over 10 min (velocity); exactly as described in Example A, under steady-state conditions. The absorbance increase was sigmoidal over time, reflecting the coupled reactions of the activation of prothrombin by the FXa-containing prothrombinase complex, and the subsequent hydrolysis of Pefachrome tPA by the generated thrombin. The data from each well of a triplicate were combined and fit by reiterative, linear least squares regression analysis, as a function of absorbance versus time<sup>2</sup>, as described (Carson, S.D. Comput. Prog. Biomed. 19: 151-157 (1985)) to determine the initial velocity (V<sub>i</sub>) of prothrombin activation. Ratios of inhibited steady-state initial velocities containing NAP (Vi) to the uninhibited velocity of prothrombinase fXa alone (V<sub>o</sub>) were plotted against the corresponding concentrations of NAP. These data were directly fit to the equation for tight-binding inhibitors, as in Example A above, and the apparent equilibrium dissociation inhibitory constant K<sub>i</sub>* was calculated.</p>\n  Table 3 below gives the dissociation inhibitor constant (Ki*) of recombinant AcaNAP5 [SEQ.

In contrast, AcaNAPc2 appears to be interacting with FXa in a way that only perturbs the macromolecular interactions of this enzyme with either the substrate and/or cofactor (Factor Va), while not directly inhibiting the catalytic turnover of the peptidyl substrate (see Table 1).</p>\n  Example D\n  In Vitro Enzyme Assays for Activity Specificity Determination.</p>\n  The ability of NAP of the present invention to act as a selective inhibitor of FXa catalytic activity or TF/VIIa activity was assessed by determining whether the test NAP would inhibit other enzymes in an assay at a concentration that was 100-fold higher than the concentration of the following related serine proteases: thrombin, Factor Xa, Factor XIa, Factor XIIa, kallikrein, activated protein C, plasm",

Activation of tritiated Factor IX by the rFVIIa/rTF/PLV complex was assessed by determining the respective intrinsic inhibition constant, Ki*.</p>\n  Lyophilized, purified, recombinant human factor VIIa was obtained from BiosPacific, Inc. (Emeryville, Calif.), and reconstituted in HBS (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM sodium chloride) prior to use. Purified human Factor X was obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories, Inc. (South Bend, Ind.) and Factor Xa (free FXa) was activated and prepared from Factor X as described (Bock, P. E., Craig, P. A., Olson, S. T., and Singh, P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 273:375-388 (1989)). Active site-blocked human Factor Xa (EGR-FXa), which had been irreversibly inactivated with L-Glutamyl-L-glycyl-L-arginyl chloromethylketone, was obtained from Haematologic Technologies, Inc. (Essex Junction, Vt.). Recombinant human tissue factor (rTF) was produced by a baculovirus-expression system, and purified to homogeneity by monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography (Corvas International, Inc., San Diego, Calif.).</p>\n  The purified rTF apoprotein was incorporated into phospholipid vesicles (rTF/PLV), consisting of phosphotidyl choline (75%, w/v) and phosphotidyl serine (25%, w/v) in the presence of detergent, as described by Ruf et al. (Ruf, W., Miles, D. J., Rehemtulla, A., and Edgington, T. S. Methods in Enzymology 222: 209-224 (1993)). The phospholipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, (Alabaster, Ala.). The buffer used for all assays was HBSA, HBS containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. All reagents were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, Mo.), unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n  The activation of human <sup>3</sup>H-Factor IX (FIX) by the rFVIIa/rTF complex was monitored by measuring the release of the radiolabelled activation peptide. Purified human fIX was obtained from Haematologic Technologies, Inc. (Essex Junction, Vt.), and radioactively labelled by reductive tritiation as described (Van Lenten &amp; Ashwell, 1971, JBC 246, 1889-1894). The resulting tritiated preparation of FIX had a specific activity of 194 clotting units/mg as measured in immuno-depleted FIX deficient plasma (Ortho), and retained 97% of its activity. The radiospecific activity was 2.7\u00d710<sup>8 </sup>dpm/mg. The Km for the activation of <sup>3</sup>H-FIX by rFVIIa/rTF/PLV was 25 nM, which was equivalent to the Km obtained for untreated (unlabelled) FIX.</p>\n  The assay for Ki* determinations was conducted as follows: rFVIIa and rTF/PLV were combined in a polypropylene test tube, and allowed to form a complex for 10 min in HBSA, containing 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Aliquots of rFVIIa/rTF/PLV complex were combined in the appropriate polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes with EGR-FXa or free FXa, when included, and either the NAP test compound at various concentrations, after dilution into HBSA, or HBSA alone (as V<sub>o </sub>(uninhibited velocity) control). Following an incubation of 60 min at ambient temperature, reactions were initiated by the addition of <sup>3</sup>H-FIX. The final concentration of the reactants in 420 \u03bcl of HBSA was:\nrFVIIa [50 pM], rTF [2.7 nM], PLV [6.4 micromolar], either EGR-FXa or free FXa [300 pM], recombinant NAP [5-1,500 pM], <sup>3</sup>H-FIX [200 nM], and CaCl<sub>2</sub>[5 mM]. In addition, a background control reaction was run that included all of the above reactants, except rFVIIa.\n</p>\n  At specific time points (8, 16, 24, 32, and 40 min), 80 \u03bcl of the reaction mixture was added to an eppendorf tube that contained an equal volume of 50 mM EDTA in HBS with 0.5% BSA to stop the reaction; this was followed by the addition of 160 \u03bcL of 6% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The protein was precipitated, and separated from the supernatant by centrifugation at 16,000\u00d7g for 6 min at 4\u00b0 C. The radioactivity contained in the resulting supernatant was measured by removing triplicate aliquots that were added to Scintiverse BD (Fisher Scientific, Fairlawn, N.J.), and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. The control rate of activation was determined by linear regression analysis of the soluble counts released over time under steady-state conditions, where less than 5% of the tritiated FIX was consumed. The background control (&lt;1.0% of control velocity) was subtracted from all samples. Ratios of inhibited steady-state velocities (Vi), in the presence of a NAP, to the uninhibited control velocity of rFVIIa/TF alone (V<sub>o</sub>) were plotted against the corresponding concentrations of NAP. These data were then directly fit to an equation for tight-binding inhibitors [Morrison, J. F., and Walsh, C. T., Adv. Enzymol. 61:201-300 (1988)], from which the apparent equilibrium dissociation inhibitory constant Ki* was calculated.</p>\n  The data for recombinant AcaNAP5, AcaNAP6, AcaNAPc2, and AceNAP4 (prepared as described) is presented in Table 6 following Section B, below.</p>\n  (2) Factor VIIa/Tissue Factor Amidolytic Assay</p>\n  The ability of NAPs of the present invention to act as an inhibitor of the amidolytic activity of the fVIIa/TF complex was assessed by determining the respective inhibition constant, Ki*, in the presence and absence of active site-blocked human Factor Xa (EGR-fXa).</p>\n  rFVIIa/rTF amidolytic activity was determined using the chromogenic substrate S-2288 (H-D-isoleucyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine-p-nitroaniline), obtained from Kabi Pharmacia Hepar, Inc. (Franklin, Ohio). The substrate was reconstituted in deionized water prior to use. rFVIIa and rTF/PLV were combined in a polypropylene test tube, and allowed to form a complex for 10 min in HBSA, containing 3 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. The assay for Ki* determinations was conducted by combining in appropriate wells of a Corning microtiter plate 50 \u03bcL of the rFVIIa/rTF/PLV complex, 50 \u03bcL of EGR-FXa, and 50 \u03bcL of either the NAP test compound at various concentrations, after dilution into HBSA, or HBSA alone (for V<sub>o </sub>(uninhibited velocity) measurement). Following an incubation of 30 min at ambient temperature, the triplicate reactions were initiated by adding 50 \u03bcL of S-2288. The final concentration of reactants in a total volume of 200 \u03bcL of HBSA was: recombinant NAP (0.025-25 mM), rFVIIa (750 pM), rTF (3.0 nM), PLV (6.4 micromolar), EGR-FXa (2.5 nM), and S-228B (3.0 mM, 3\u00d7Km).</p>\n  The amidolytic activity of rFVIIa/rTF/PLV was measured as a linear increase in the absorbance at 405 nm over 10 min (velocity), using a Thermo Max\u00ae Kinetic Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Palo Alto, Calif.), under steady-state conditions, where less than 5% of the substrate was consumed. Ratios of inhibited pre-equilibrium, steady-state velocities (Vi), in the presence of NAP, to the uninhibited velocity in the presence of free fXa alone (V<sub>o</sub>) were plotted against the corresponding concentrations of NAP. These data were then directly fit to the same equation for tight-binding inhibitors, used in Example E.1., from which the apparent equilibrium dissociation inhibitory constant K<sub>i</sub>* was calculated.</p>\n  Table 6 below gives the Ki* values of recombinant AcaNAPc2 [SEQ. ID. NO. 59], AceNAP4 [SEQ. ID. NO. 62], AcaNAP5 [SEQ. ID. NO. 4], and AcaNAP6 [SEQ. ID. NO. 6] (prepared in Pichia pastoris, as described) in inhibitory assays of rFVIIa/rTF activity. The data shows the utility of AcaNAPc2 and AceNAP4 as potent inhibitors of the human rFVIIa/rTF/PLV complex in the absence and presence of either free FXa or active site-blocked FXa. The in vitro activity of AcaNAPc2P (see Example 17) was substantially the same as AcaNAPc2.</p>\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n          \n            \n              \n              TABLE 6\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              Ki* (pM)\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n            \n              \n              Amidolytic Assay\n              3<sub>H</sub>-FIX Activation\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n            \n              NAP\n              No FXa\n              Plus EGR-\n              No FXa\n              +free\n              +EGR-\n            \n            \n              Compound\n              Addition\n              FXa\n              Addition\n              FXa\n              FXa\n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              AcaNAPc2\n              NI\n              \u200236 \u00b1 20\n              NI\n              35 \u00b1 5\n              8.4 \u00b1 1.5\n            \n            \n              AceNAP4\n              59,230 \u00b1\n              378 \u00b1 37\n              ND\n              ND\n              ND\n            \n            \n              \n              3,600\n            \n            \n              AcaNAP5\n              NI\n              NI\n              NI\n              NI\n              NI\n            \n            \n              AcaNAP6\n              NI\n              NI\n              NI\n              NI\n              NI\n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              NI = no inhibition \n            \n            \n              ND = not determined \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  </p>\n  Example F\n  In Viv"
