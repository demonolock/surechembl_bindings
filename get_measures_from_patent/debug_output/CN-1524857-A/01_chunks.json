    "        4, in the 19-25 page or leaf to diphosphonate application in these areas summarize.Diphosphonate with this respect purposes comprises alendronate, tiludronat, dimethyl-APD, risedronate, etidronate, YM-175, clodronate, pamidronate and BM-210995 (ibandronate), but is not limited in these.According to their drug effect, to the patient use every day oral dosage be 0.1mg to 5g diphosphonate and every day dosage be (L)-(+)-tartrate of 0.01mg/kg body weight to the formula I compound of 20mg/kg body weight, to obtain osteoporosis is effectively treated.\n        </p>(L)-(+)-tartrate of formula I compound can with mammiferous estrogen agonists/antagonist combined utilization.Estrogen agonists/antagonist all can be used as second kind of compound of this respect of the present invention arbitrarily.Term estrogen agonists/antagonist is meant and can combines, suppress the compound that bone upgrades and prevent bone loss with estrogen receptor.Particularly, estrogen agonists is defined herein as and can combines with the estrogen receptor in the mammalian tissues, and simulates the chemical compound of estrogen effect in one or more tissues.Antiestrogen is defined herein as and can combines with the estrogen receptor in the mammalian tissues, and blocks the chemical compound of estrogen effect in one or more tissues.Measuring method those skilled in the art according to standard can easily measure this activity.The measuring method of these standards comprises: estrogen receptor binding assay, standard bone Histomorphometry and densitometry are (referring to Eriksen E.F. etc., \" osseous tissue morphometry \", Raven press, New York, 1994,1-74 page or leaf; Grier S.J. etc., \" application of dual intensity X line absorption assay method in animal \", Inv.Radiol., 1996,31 (1): 50-62; WahnerH.W and Fogelman I., \" evaluation of osteoporosis: the dual intensity X line absorption assay method in clinical \", Martin Dunitz Ltd., London, 1994,1-296 page or leaf).Below these are described with various compounds for referencial use.But those skilled in the art should be able to know other estrogen agonists/antagonist.A kind of preferred estrogen agonists/antagonist is a droloxifene: (phenol, 3-[1-[4[2-(dimethylamino) oxyethyl group]-phenyl]-2-phenyl-1-butylene base]-, (E)-) with relevant compound, this compound is disclosed in United States Patent (USP) 5, in 047,43, its specification sheets also at this as a reference.</p>Another preferred estrogen agonists/antagonist is a tamoxifen: (ethamine, 2-[-4-(1,2-phenylbenzene-1-butylene base) phenoxy group]-N, the N-dimethyl, (Z)-2-, 2-hydroxyl-1,2, the 3-third tri-carboxylic acids ester (1: 1)) with relevant compound, these compounds are disclosed in United States Patent (USP) 4, in 536,516, its specification sheets at this with for referencial use.Another relevant compound is the 4-trans-Hydroxytamoxifen, and it is disclosed in United States Patent (USP) 4,623, in 660, its specification sheets at this with for referenc"
