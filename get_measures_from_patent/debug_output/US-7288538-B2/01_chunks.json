    "r express human CCR-9 receptor. CCR-9-Flp-CHO cells are seeded at 20,000 cells/well in a clear bottom, black wall 96-well plate (Greiner) one day prior to assay. Cells are grown in a tissue culture incubator at 37\u00b0 C. with 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>for 18 to 24 hours.</p>Wash buffer and dye loading buffer are prepared fresh each time the assay is performed. Wash buffer is prepared according to the following protocol: 20 ml 10\u00d7HBSS, 4 ml 1 M HEPES, 176 ml sterile water; then add 142 mg Probenecid to solution and pH to 7.4. This wash buffer contains 1\u00d7HBSS, 20 mM HEPES and 2.5 mM probenecid. For one 96-well plate, dye loading buffer is prepared as following: 11 ml wash buffer, 44 \u25a1l Fluo-4/pluoronic acid mix (22 \u25a1l aliquot 2 mM Fluo-4 (Molecular Probes #F-14201, 50 \u03bcg/tube)+22 \u25a1l 20% pluronic F-127 (Molecular Devices, P-3000).</p>Cells are loaded with dye according to the protocol below:\n1. Prepare wash buffer with 1\u00d7HBSS/HEPES at room temperature2. Prepare loading buffer (keep in dark)3. Aspirate culture media4. Add 100 \u03bcl dye loading buffer to each well5. Incubate at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 hr6. Aspirate loading buffer7. Wash with 200 \u03bcl per well\u00d728. Add 100 \u03bcl wash buffer per well9. Ready to assay plate with FLIPR or FlexStation\n</p>10 mM stock compounds in DMSO are prepared. Compounds are diluted in wash buffer to make 8 point series dilutions containing same concentration of DMSO (less than 0.3%). Compounds are tested in duplicate wells for each point. Ligand rhTECK was diluted to 5\u00d7 of its EC50 with wash buffer containing 0.5% BSA. Appropriate amount of 5\u00d7 ligand is added to each well. Data is analyzed using GraphPad Prism software to calculate IC50 value of antagonist activity for each compound.</p>The following Examples are illustrative but not limiting of the present invention:</p>EXAMPLE 1N-(2,4,6-trimethyl-3-pyrrolidin-1-yl-phenyl)-thiophene-2-carboxamide1). 2,4,6-Trimethyl-3-pyrrolidin-1-yl-phenylamine (2). To a solution of 2,4,6-trimethyl-1,3-phenylenediamine (15.0 g, 99.8 mmol) in anhydrous DMF (300 mL) were sequentially added potassium carbonate (30.4 g, 219.7 mmol) and 1,4-dibromobutane (11.9 mL, 99.8 mmol). The reaction was stirred overnight and then partitioned between water and ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried (MgSO<sub>4</sub>) and concentrated. The residue was chromatographed eluting with hexanes:ethyl acetate (20:1) to give the desired product (10.8 g, 53%).</p>The titled compound was synthesized as shown in scheme 2 using 2 to give a white solid (ESI [M+H<sup>+</sup>])=315.21.</p>EXAMPLES 2\u201397 (Table 1) Were Synthesized in Similar FashionEXAMPLE 973,5-dichloro-N-(3-diethylamino-2,4,6-trimethyl-phenyl)-2-hydroxy-benzenesulfonamide1) Diethylamino-2,4,6-trimethyl-phenylamine (5). Compound 5 was synthesized as shown in Scheme 1 using a literature procedure (Wu, et. al. J. Med. Chem. 1999, 42, 4485\u20134499).</p>2) The title compound was synthesized by coupling of 5 with 3,5-dichloro-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonyl chloride as shown in Scheme 2 for 21 to give a yellow solid (ESI [M+H<sup>+</sup>]=431.2).</p>EXAMPLE 983,5-dichloro-2-hydroxy-N-(4-pyrrolidin-1-yl-phenyl)-benzenesulfonamide"
