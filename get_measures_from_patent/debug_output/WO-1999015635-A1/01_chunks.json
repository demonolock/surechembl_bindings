    " described, for example, in Example II.</p>\n  A filter assay based on the protocol of Reuter et al. (1995) is also used to screen for compounds which modulate the activity of the novel kinase described herein: Starting with MBP coated 96-well FlashPlates\u00ae (NEN\u2122 Life Science Products) reaction buffer (3X kinase reaction buffer (KRB) contains: 60 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 30 mM magnesium acetate, 0.15 mM ATP, 3 mM DTT, 0.03 mM sodium orthovanadate) is added, 0.25\u03bcCi [\u03b3 33p]-ATP at a concentration no greater than 1 \u03bcg/ml, (determined by titration of individual enzyme preparations for a concentration that allows kinetic determinations over a 1 hour time course of the human kinase) of the human kinase are added to each well and incubated 1 hour at 30\u00b0C in the presence or absence of lO\u03bcM test compound. Total reaction volume is lOO\u03bcL. The reaction is stopped by the addition of EDTA (pH 7.0) to a final concentration of 80mM. The samples are centrifliged and 50\u03bcL of the supernatant spotted on p81 cation-exchange filter paper (Whatman, No. 3698 915). The filters are then washed 3 times in 200mL of 180mM H3PO4 (5-10min each), and once in 200mL of 96% ethanol. After air drying the filters, radioactivity is determined by Cerenkov counting in a scintillation counter. Compounds which inhibit kinase activity &gt;50 percent at lO\u03bcM are are indicated by a &gt;50% reduction in scintillation counts. Specificity and selectivity studies is determined by titration of inhibitory compounds to determine the IC50 (or other standard quantitation well known in the art for comparison) and by the substitution of other kinases in the assay. For example, determination of relative inhibitory activity of the kinase in comparison to recombinant SOK-1, expressed and isolated in a similar manner, assayed under similar conditions, provides selectivity data.

The effects of an candidate agent in inhibiting tumor growth can be determined as follows. Approximately 1 x lO^cells of the CCL 221 cell line (ATCC, Rockville, Md.), a human ras-dependent colon adenocarcinoma cell line, is suspended in 100 mu 1 DMEM and injected subcutaneously into SCID mice, such that two tumors per mouse are formed. SCID mice receive CCL 221 cells and the \n\ntumors are grown for 7 days without treatment; on the 7th day (Day 0) tumor maximal diameters and animal weights are recorded and the mean tumor size for the mice is determined. On Day 1 (eight days following tumor cell injection), treatment of the mice with candidate agent or vehicle alone is begun. One group of the mice (controls) are injected intraperitoneally with 0.2 ml of vehicle and a second group of mice recei",

Total reaction volume is lOO\u03bcL. Following incubation, the reaction mixture is aspirated and the wells rinsed 2 times with 300\u03bcL PBS. Incorporation of raiolabeled phosphate is determined by scintillation counting, Packard Instrument Co.TopCount, 12-detector, 96-well microplate scintillation counter and luminescence counter, model B991200.

Ten (10)\u03bcl of the 1 : 100 dilution solutions (25 \u03bcg/ml in 1% DMSO) are prepared in 96 well Microlite 1 plates (Dynatech) and plates are stored at - 20\u00b0C until the evening prior to the start of the assay.</p>\n  Control plates A plate containing control solutions is included in each run of the screen for QA purposes. Such plates are prepared at the beginning of the HTS campaign and stored at -20\u00b0C until required.
