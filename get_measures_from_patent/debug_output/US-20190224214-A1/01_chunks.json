    "xpressed and enriched in insect (Sf9) cell membrane fractions using a previously published procedure.</p>Peptide Substrate Fluorescent Labeling.</p>Peptide substrates were labeled with acrylodan on a cysteine thiol and HPLC purified as previously reported.</p>hGOAT Activity Assays and Analysis.</p>hGOAT activity assays were performed using a modification of previously reported protocols. For each assay, membrane fraction from Sf9 cells expressing hGOAT was thawed on ice and passed through an 18-gauge needle 10 times to homogenize. Assays were performed with \u02dc100 \u03bcg of membrane protein, as determined by Bradford assay. Membrane fraction was preincubated with 1 \u03bcM methoxy arachadonyl fluorophosphonate (MAFP) and inhibitor or vehicle as indicated in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.0 for 30 minutes at room temperature. Reactions were initiated with the addition of 500 \u25a1M octanoyl CoA and 1.5 \u03bcM fluorescently-labeled ghrelin mimetic, GSSFLC<sub>Acrylodan</sub>, for a total volume of 50 \u03bcL, and were incubated for 3 hours at room temperature in the dark. Reactions were stopped with the addition of 50 \u03bcL of 20% acetic acid in isopropanol, and solutions were clarified by protein precipitation with 16.7 \u03bcL of 20% trichloroacetic acid, followed by centrifugation (1,000\u00d7g, 1 minute). The supernatant was then analyzed by reverse phase HPLC, as previously described. Data reported are the average of three independent determinations, with error bars representing one standard deviation.</p>Determination of IC50 Values in In Vitro hGOAT Activity Assay</p>For inhibition experiments, reactions were performed and analyzed as described in the presence of either inhibitor or vehicle (DMSO or ethanol) as appropriate.

Triethyl amine (0.087 mL, 0.623 mmol) was added and the resulting mixture was allowed to warm to rt and stirred for another 1.5 h before it was quenched with 1MHCl. The layers separated and organic layer was washed twice with sodium thiosulphate, then combined, dried over sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrated reaction mixture was purified with flash column chromatography using 2% ethyl acetate/98% hexane as t"
