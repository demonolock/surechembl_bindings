{"raw_mentions": "The binding affinity of an anti-C\u03b5mX antibody described herein can be less than about 100 nM, e.g., less than about 50 nM, about 10 nM, about 1 nM, about 500 pM, about 100 pM, or about 50 pM to any of about 2 pM.\nBinding affinity can be expressed K<sub>D </sub>or dissociation constant, and an increased binding affinity corresponds to a decreased K<sub>D</sub>. \nThe affinity of an anti-C\u03b5mX Fab fragment of an antibody can be determined by surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore3000\u2122 surface plasmon resonance (SPR) system, BIAcore, INC, Piscaway N.J.). \nKinetic association rates (k<sub>on</sub>) and dissociation rates (k<sub>off</sub>) (generally measured at 25\u00b0 C.) are obtained; and equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) values are calculated as koff/kon."}
