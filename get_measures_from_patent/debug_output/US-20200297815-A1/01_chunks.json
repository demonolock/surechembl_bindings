    "is a term well understood in the art, and methods to determine such specific binding are also well known in the art. A molecule is said to exhibit \u201cspecific binding\u201d if it reacts or associates more frequently, more rapidly, with greater duration and/or with greater affinity with a particular target antigen than it does with alternative targets. An antibody \u201cspecifically binds\u201d to a target antigen if it binds with greater affinity, avidity, more readily, and/or with greater duration than it binds to other substances. For example, an antibody that specifically (or preferentially) binds to a C\u03b5mX domain epitope is an antibody that binds this C\u03b5mX domain epitope with greater affinity, avidity, more readily, and/or with greater duration than it binds to other C\u03b5mX domain epitopes or non-C\u03b5mX domain epitopes. It is also understood by reading this definition that, for example, an antibody that specifically binds to a first target antigen may or may not specifically or preferentially bind to a second target antigen. As such, \u201cspecific binding\u201d or \u201cpreferential binding\u201d does not necessarily require (although it can include) exclusive binding. Generally, but not necessarily, reference to binding means preferential binding.</p>The binding affinity of an anti-C\u03b5mX antibody described herein can be less than about 100 nM, e.g., less than about 50 nM, about 10 nM, about 1 nM, about 500 pM, about 100 pM, or about 50 pM to any of about 2 pM. Binding affinity can be expressed K<sub>D </sub>or dissociation constant, and an increased binding affinity corresponds to a decreased K<sub>D</sub>. One way of determining binding affinity of antibodies to C\u03b5mX is by measuring binding affinity of monofunctional Fab fragments of the antibody. To obtain monofunctional Fab fragments, an antibody (for example, IgG) can be cleaved with papain or expressed recombinantly. The affinity of an anti-C\u03b5mX Fab fragment of an antibody can be determined by surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore3000\u2122 surface plasmon resonance (SPR) system, BIAcore, INC, Piscaway N.J.). Kinetic association rates (k<sub>on</sub>) and dissociation rates (k<sub>off</sub>) (generally measured at 25\u00b0 C.) are obtained; and equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) values are calculated as koff/kon.</p>In some embodiments, the antibody binds the C\u03b5mX domain of a human IgE, and does not significantly bind an IgE from another mammalian species. In some embodiments, the antibody binds human IgE as well as one or more IgE from another mammalian species. The epitope(s) bound by the antibody can be continuous or discontinuous.</p>In some embodiments, the anti-C\u03b5mX antibody described herein binds an N-terminal portion of the C\u03b5mX domain, e.g., GLAGGSAQSQRAPDRVL (SEQ ID NO:1) or GLAGGSAQSQRA (SEQ ID NO:7). Such an antibody may have the same heavy chain and/or light chain CDRs as antibody 4B12/FB825 as described in FIG. 4. See also U.S. Pat. No. 8,460,664, the relevant disclosures therein are incorporated by reference herein. The anti-C\u03b5mX antibody may be a humanized antibody of 4B12 (e.g., FB825). In some examples, the anti-C\u03b5mX antibody for use in the methods described herein is FB825, which is a humanized antibody of 4B12 (FIG. 4), or a functional variant thereof. See also U.S. Pat. No. 8,460,664, the relevant disclosures therein are incorporated by reference herein.</p>Two antibodies having the same V<sub>H </sub>and/or V<sub>L </sub>CDRs means that their CDRs are identical when determined by the same approach (e.g., the Kabat approach, the Chothia approach, the AbM approach, the Contact approach, or the IMGT approach as known in the art. See, e.g., bioinf.org.uk/abs/).</p>A functional variant (equivalen"
