    "ceptor sites have been identified on target tissues, such as kidney, adrenal, blood vessels, and cultured cells. Napier, M.A., et al., Proc Nat Acad Sci USA (1984) 81:5946-5940 ; DeLean, A., et al.,</p>Endocrinology (1984) 115:1636-1638 ; Schenk, D.B., et al., Biochem Biophys Res Comm (1985) 127 :433-442. Since the binding of ANP or ANP analogs to these specific receptor sites is presumptively a prerequisite of biological activity, binding of ANP analogs to these receptors is considered predictive of biological activity. \n\n An assay has been developed, generally in accordance with the disclosure of Schenk, supra, and Scarborough, R.M., et al., J Biol Chem (1986) 261:12960-12964; which evaluates the ability of ANP analogs to compete with labeled native ANP for binding to cultured BASM and BAE cells. This native ANP, having the amino acid sequence:</p>126 150</p>R-S-S-C-F-G-G-R-I-D-R-I-G-A-Q-S-G-L-G-C-N-S-F-R-Y was iodinated on the carboxy-terminal Y residue and is identified as (<sup>125</sup>I)-rANP(126-150). Analogous</p>\"competitive displacement\" receptor binding assays are considered commonplace in the art for examining specific ligand-receptor interactions.</p>In this assay, 0.5 nM (<sup>125</sup>I)-rANP(126-150) is incubated in each individual sample of BASM cells in the presence of varying amounts of unlabeled rANP(126-150) or the test compound. The concentration of unlabeled peptide at which 50% of maximal (<sup>125</sup>I)-rANP(126-150) binding is displaced is called Ki(app) and reflects receptor-binding affinity. Therefore, hypothetical peptide A, with a</p>Ki(app)=100nM, displays substantially weaker interaction with a receptor than hypothetical peptide B with a Ki(app)=10nM. Assuming these ANP analogs act at one or more ANP receptor sites, then increased receptor affinity should reflect increased biological potency.</p>Table 1 presents data which compare the concentrations at which analog compounds of the invention displace (<sup>125</sup>I)-rANP(126-150) binding from specific receptor sites on BASM or BAE cells \n\n Table 1</p>Ki(app)</p>Peptide Sequence (nM)</p>AP577 ( 2-NA) -C-G-R-I-D-R-I-G-A-C-NH<sub>2</sub> 30.0</p>AP578 (2-NA)-G-C-R-I-D-R-I-G-A-C-NH<sub>2</sub> 24.0</p>AP579 (2-NA)-C<sup>\u2020</sup>-G-R-I-D-R-I-G-A-C-NH<sub>2</sub> 35.3</p>AP580 (2-NA)-G-C<sup>\u2020</sup>-R-I-D-R-I-G-A-C-NH<sub>2</sub> 110.5</p>AP581 (2-NA)-G-C-R-I-D-R-I-G-A-C<sup>\u2020</sup>-NH<sub>2</sub> 21.2</p>AP582 (2-NA)-C-G-R-I-D-R-I-G-A-C<sup>\u2020</sup>-NH<sub>2</sub> 21.9</p>AP583 (2-NA)-C<sup>\u2020</sup>-G-R-I-D-R-I-G-A-C<sup>\u2020</sup>-NH<sub>2</sub> 109.1</p>AP584 (2-NA)-C<sup>\u2020</sup>-G-R-I-D-R-I-G-C<sup>\u2020</sup>-NH<sub>2</sub> 104.1</p>AP585 (2-NA)-G-C<sup>\u2020</sup>-R-I-D-R-I-G-C<sup>\u2020</sup>-NH<sub>2</sub> 140.0</p>AP586 (2-NA)-G-C<sup>\u2020</sup>-R-I-D-R-I-G-A-C<sup>\u2020</sup>-NH<sub>2</sub> 124.0</p>AP587 (2-NA)-C<sup>\u2020</sup>-G-R-I-D-R-I-G-C-NH<sub>2</sub> 39.5</p>AP588 (2-NA)-C-G-R-I-D-R-I-G-C-NH<sub>2</sub> 6.0</p>AP589 (2-NA)-G-C-R-I-D-R-I-G-C-NH<sub>2</sub> 73.5</p>AP540 (2-NA)-C-G-R-I-D-R-I-C-NH<sub>2</sub> &gt;400</p>AP541 (2-NA)-G-C-R-I-D-R-I-C-NH<sub>2</sub> 393.0</p>AP542 ( 2-NA)-G-C -R-I-D-R-I-G-C-NH<sub>2</sub> 375.0 \n\nThe compound AP543 demonstrates that the bridge need not be a disulfide:</p>AP543- \n\n 8.9</p>This compound without a disulfide ring but wherein X<sub>1</sub> is hydrophobic is highly active.</p>In order to show that the receptor binding assay is specific to ANP, data which compares ANP-receptor interactions of rANP( 126-150) with the unrelated peptide hormones angiotensin II, glucagon, parathyroid hormone and gamma-MSH is shown:</p>Peptide Ki(app) rANP(126-150) .7.50 angiotensin II &gt;500 glucagon &gt;500 parathyroid hormone &gt;500 gamma-MSH &gt;500</p>As shown above, only rANP( 126-150) displays detectable ANP-receptor affinity.
