    "stering the anti-mesothelin immunoconjugates of the present invention with one or more anti-angiogenic agents, which includes, but is not limited to, angiostatin, thalidomide, kringle 5, endostatin, Serpin (Serine Protease Inhibitor) anti-thrombin, 29 kDa N-terminal and a 40 kDa C-terminal proteolytic fragments of fibronectin, 16 kDa proteolytic fragment of prolactin, 7.8 kDa proteolytic fragment of platelet factor-4, a \u03b2-amino acid peptide corresponding to a fragment of platelet factor-4 (Maione et al., 1990, Cancer Res. 51:2077), a 14-amino acid peptide corresponding to a fragment of collagen I (Tolma et al., 1993, J. Cell Biol. 122:497), a 19 amino acid peptide corresponding to a fragment of Thrombospondin I (Tolsma et al., 1993, J. Cell Biol. 122:497), a 20-amino acid peptide corresponding to a fragment of SPARC (Sage et al., 1995, J. Cell. Biochem. 57: 1329-), or any fragments, family members, or derivatives thereof, including pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Other peptides that inhibit angiogenesis and correspond to fragments of laminin, fibronectin, procollagen, and EGF have also been described (See the review by Cao, 1998, Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 20:161). Monoclonal antibodies and cyclic pentapeptides, which block certain integrins that bind RGD proteins (i.e., possess the peptide motif Arg-Gly- Asp), have been demonstrated to have anti-vascularization activities (Brooks et al., 1994, Science 264:569; Hammes et al., 1996, Nature Medicine 2:529). Moreover, inhibition of the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor by antagonists inhibits angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis (Min et al., 1996, Cancer Res. 56:2428-33; Crowley et aL, 1993, Proc Natl Acad. Sci. USA 90:5021). Use of such anti-angiogenic agents is also contemplated by the present invention.</p>In another aspect, the anti-mesothelin immunoconjugates of the present invention are administered in combination with a regimen of radiation.</p>The anti-mesothelin immunoconjugates of the present invention can also be administered in combination with one or more cytokines, which includes, but is not limited to, lymphokines, tumor necrosis factors, tumor necrosis factor-like cytokines, lymphotoxin-a, lymphotoxin-\u03b2, interferon-\u03b2, macrophage inflammatory proteins, granulocyte monocyte colony stimulating factor, interleukins (including, but not limited to, interleukin-1, interleukin-2, interleukin-6, interleukin-12, interleukin-15, interleukin- 18), OX40, CD27, CD30, CD40 or CD 137 ligands, Fas-Pas ligand, 4- IBBL, endothelial monocyte activating protein or any fragments, family members, or derivatives thereof, including pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.</p>The anti-mesothelin immunoconjugates of the present invention can also be administered in combination with a cancer vaccine, examples of which include, but are not limited to, autologous cells or tissues, non-autologous cells or tissues, carcinoembryonic antigen, alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, BC"
