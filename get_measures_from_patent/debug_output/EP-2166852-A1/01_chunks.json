The IC<sub>50</sub> values for the exemplified compounds range from sub nM to 10 \u03bcM in a 3 -concentration dose response curve.</p>Benzodiazepine binding assay</p>[0303] Whole brain (except cerebellum) of male Wistar derived rats weighing 175 \u00b1 25 g were used to prepare GABA<sub>A</sub> central benzodiazepine receptor in Na-K phosphate buffer pH 7.4. A 5 mg aliquot was incubated with 1 nM (<sup>3</sup>H)-fiunitrazepam for 60 minutes at 25<sup>0</sup>C. Experiments were performed in the presence or absence of 30 \u03bcM of GABA. Non-specific binding was estimated in the presence of 10 \u03bcM of diazepam. Membranes were filtered and washed, the filters were then counted to determine (<sup>3</sup>H)- flunitrazepam specifically bound. Test compounds were tested in duplicate according to the required concentrations (Damm, H. W., et a (1978) Res. Comm. Chem. Pathol.

If not indicated, a hydrogen atom is assumed to be present on nitrogen atoms to provide a neutral compound. The compounds of Table 1 can exist in additional isomeric forms, for example, the compounds can exist as tautomers of the drawn structures. The compounds disclosed in Table 1 encompass all possible tautomers of the drawn structures. One of skill in the art will unde"
