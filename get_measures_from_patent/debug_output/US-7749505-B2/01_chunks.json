    "d second polypeptides have non-essential N-terminal amino acid regions that can be used to separate the functional domains and prevent steric interference.</p>The ligated DNA sequences are operably linked to suitable transcriptional or translational regulatory elements. The regulatory elements responsible for expression of DNA are located only 5\u2032 to the DNA sequence encoding the first polypeptides. Similarly, stop codons required to end translation and transcription termination signals are only present 3\u2032 to the DNA sequence encoding the second polypeptide.</p>The fusion polypeptide can comprise a polypeptide as described herein together with an unrelated immunogenic protein, such as an immunogenic protein capable of eliciting a recall response. Examples of such proteins include tetanus, tuberculosis and hepatitis proteins (see, for example, Stoute et al. New Engl. J. Med., 336:86-91, 1997).</p>In one preferred embodiment, the immunological fusion partner is derived from a Mycobacterium sp., such as a Mycobacterium tuberculosis-derived Ra12 fragment. Ra12 compositions and methods for their use in enhancing the expression and/or immunogenicity of heterologous polynucleotide/polypeptide sequences is described in U.S. Patent Application 60/158,585, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Briefly, Ra12 refers to a polynucleotide region that is a subsequence of a Mycobacterium tuberculosis MTB32A nucleic acid. MTB32A is a serine protease of 32 KD molecular weight encoded by a gene in virulent and avirulent strains of M. tuberculosis. The nucleotide sequence and amino acid sequence of MTB32A have been described (for example, U.S. Patent Application 60/158,585; see also, Skeiky et al., Infection and Immun. (1999) 67:3998-4007, incorporated herein by reference). C-terminal fragments of the MTB32A coding sequence express at high levels and remain as a soluble polypeptides throughout the purification process. Moreover, Ra12 may enhance the immunogenicity of heterologous immunogenic polypeptides with which it is fused. One preferred Ra12 fusion polypeptide comprises a 14 KD C-terminal fragment corresponding to amino acid residues 192 to 323 of MTB32A.</p>Other preferred Ra12 polynucleotides generally comprise at least about 15 consecutive nucleotides, at least about 30 nucleotides, at least about 60 nucleotides, at least about 100 nucleotides, at least about 200 nucleotides, or at least about 300 nucleotides that encode a portion of a Ra12 polypeptide.</p>Ra12 polynucleotides may comprise a native sequence (i.e., an endogenous sequence that encodes a Ra12 polypeptide or a portion thereof) or may comprise a variant of such a sequence. Ra12 polynucleotide variants may contain one or more substitutions, additions, deletions and/or insertions such that the biological activity of the encoded fusion polypeptide is not substantially diminished, relative to a fusion polypeptide comprising a native Ra12 polypeptide. Variants preferably exhibit at least about 70% identity, more preferably at least about 80% identity and most preferably at least about 90% identity to a polynucleotide sequence that encodes a native Ra12 polypeptide or a portion thereof.</p>Within other preferred embodiments, an immunological fusion partner is derived from protein D, a surface protein of the gram-negative bacterium Haemophilus influenza B (WO 91/18926). Preferably, a protein D derivative comprises approximately the first third of the protein (e.g., the first N-terminal 100-110 amino acids), and a protein D derivative may be lipidated. Within certain preferred embodiments,",
    "f interest is also present, its presence and expression may need to be confirmed. For example, if the sequence encoding a polypeptide is inserted within a marker gene sequence, recombinant cells containing sequences can be identified by the absence of marker gene function. Alternatively, a marker gene can be placed in tandem with a polypeptide-encoding sequence under the control of a single promoter. Expression of the marker gene in response to induction or selection usually indicates expression of the tandem gene as well.</p>Alternatively, host cells that contain and express a desired polynucleotide sequence may be identified by a variety of procedures known to those of skill in the art. These procedures include, but are not limited to, DNA-DNA or DNA-RNA hybridizations and protein bioassay or immunoassay techniques which include, for example, membrane, solution, or chip based technologies for the detection and/or quantification of nucleic acid or protein.</p>A variety of protocols for detecting and measuring the expression of polynucleotide-encoded products, using either polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies specific for the product are known in the art. Examples include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay (RIA), and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). A two-site, monoclonal-based immunoassay utilizing monoclonal antibodies reactive to two non-interfering epitopes on a given polypeptide may be preferred for some applications, but a competitive binding assay may also be employed. These and other assays are described, among other places, in Hampton, R. et al. (1990; Serological Methods, a Laboratory Manual, APS Press, St Paul, Minn.) and Maddox, D. E. et al. (1983; J. Exp. Med. 158:1211-1216).</p>A wide variety of labels and conjugation techniques are known by those skilled in the art and may be used in various nucleic acid and amino acid assays. Means for producing labeled hybridization or PCR probes for detecting sequences related to polynucleotides include oligolabeling, nick translation, end-labeling or PCR amplification using a labeled nucleotide. Alternatively, the sequences, or any portions thereof may be cloned into a vector for the production of an mRNA probe. Such vectors are known in the art, are commercially available, and may be used to synthesize RNA probes in vitro by addition of an appropriate RNA polymerase such as T7, T3, or SP6 and labeled nucleotides. These procedures may be conducted using a variety of commercially available kits. Suitable reporter molecules or labels, which may be used include radionuclides, enzymes, fluorescent, chemiluminescent, or chromogenic agents as well as substrates, cofactors, inhibitors, magnetic particles, and the like.</p>Host cells transformed with a polynucleotide sequence of interest may be cultured under conditions suitable for the expression and recovery of the protein from cell culture. The protein produced by a recombinant cell may be secreted or contained int",
    "n, and fragments thereof, may be produced by direct peptide synthesis using solid-phase techniques (Merrifield J. (1963) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 85:2149-2154). Protein synthesis may be performed using manual techniques or by automation. Automated synthesis may be achieved, for example, using Applied Biosystems 431A Peptide Synthesizer (Perkin Elmer). Alternatively, various fragments may be chemically synthesized separately and combined using chemical methods to produce the full length molecule.</p>Antibody Compositions, Fragments Thereof and Other Binding Agents</p>According to another aspect, the present invention further provides binding agents, such as antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof, that exhibit immunological binding to a tumor polypeptide disclosed herein, or to a portion, variant or derivative thereof. An antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, is said to \u201cspecifically bind,\u201d \u201cimmunogically bind,\u201d and/or is \u201cimmunologically reactive\u201d to a polypeptide of the invention if it reacts at a detectable level (within, for example, an ELISA assay) with the polypeptide, and does not react detectably with unrelated polypeptides under similar conditions.</p>Immunological binding, as used in this context, generally refers to the non-covalent interactions of the type which occur between an immunoglobulin molecule and an antigen for which the immunoglobulin is specific. The strength, or affinity of immunological binding interactions can be expressed in terms of the dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) of the interaction, wherein a smaller K<sub>d </sub>represents a greater affinity. Immunological binding properties of selected polypeptides can be quantified using methods well known in the art. One such method entails measuring the rates of antigen-binding site/antigen complex formation and dissociation, wherein those rates depend on the concentrations of the complex partners, the affinity of the interaction, and on geometric parameters that equally influence the rate in both directions. Thus, both the \u201con rate constant\u201d (K<sub>on</sub>) and the \u201coff rate constant\u201d (K<sub>off</sub>) can be determined by calculation of the concentrations and the actual rates of association and dissociation. The ratio of K<sub>off</sub>/K<sub>on </sub>enables cancellation of all parameters not related to affinity, and is thus equal to the dissociation constant K<sub>d</sub>. See, generally, Davies et al. (1990) Annual Rev. Biochem. 59:439-473.</p>An \u201cantigen-binding site,\u201d or \u201cbinding portion\u201d of an antibody refers to the part of the immunoglobulin molecule that participates in antigen binding. The antigen binding site is formed by amino acid residues of the N-terminal variable (\u201cV\u201d) regions of the heavy (\u201cH\u201d) and light (\u201cL\u201d) chains. Three highly divergent stretches within the V regions of the heavy and light chains are referred to as \u201chypervariable regions\u201d which are interposed between more conserved flanking stretches known as \u201cframework regions,\u201d or \u201cFRs\u201d. Thus the term \u201cFR\u201d refers to amino acid sequences which are naturally found between and adjacent to hypervariable regions in immunoglobulins. In an antibody molecule, the three hypervariable regions of a light chain and the three hypervariable regions of a heavy chain are disposed relative to each other in three dimensional space to form an antigen-binding surface. The antigen-binding surface is complementary to the three-dimensional surface of a bound antigen, and the three hypervariable regions of each of the heavy and light chains are referred to as \u201ccomplementarity-determining regions,\u201d or \u201cCDRs.\u201d</p>Binding agents may be further capable of differentiating between patients with and without a cancer, such as lung cancer, using the representative assays provided herein. For example, antibodies or other binding agents that bind to a tumor protein will pr",

The sequences of L521S, L522S, L523S, L524S, L525S, L526S, L527S, L528S and L529S (SEQ ID NO: 97 and 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, and 106, respectively) were found to represent known genes. The determined full-length cDNA sequence for L520S is provided in SEQ ID NO: 113, with the corresponding amino acid sequence being provided in SEQ ID NO: 114. Subsequent microarray analysis showed L520S to be overexpressed in breast tumors in addition to lung squamous tumors.</p>Further analysis demonstrated that L529S (SEQ ID NO: 106 and 115), L525S (SEQ ID NO: 102 and 120) and L527S (SEQ ID NO: 104) are cytoskeletal components and potentially squamous cell specific proteins. L529S is connexin 26, a gap junction protein. It was found to be highly expressed in one lung squamous tumor, referred to as 9688T, and moderately over-expressed in two others. However, lower level expression of connexin 26 is also detectable in normal skin, colon, liver and stomach. The over-expression of connexin 26 in some breast tumors has been reported and a mutated form of L529S may result in over-expression in lung tumors. L525S is plakophilin 1, a desmosomal protein found in plaque-bearing adhering junctions of the skin. Expression levels for L525S mRNA was highly elevated in three out of four lung squamous tumors tested, and in normal skin. L527S has been identified as keratin 6 isoform, type II 58 Kd keratin and cytokeratin 13, and shows over-expression in squamous tumors and low expression in normal skin, breast and colon tissues. Keratin and keratin-related genes have been extensively documented as potential markers for lung cancer including CYFRA2.1 (Pastor, A., et al, Eur. Respir. J., 10:603-609, 1997). L513S (SEQ ID NO: 87 and 88) shows moderate over-expression in several tumor tissues tested, and encodes a protein that was first isolated as a pemphigus vulgaris antigen.</p>L520S (SEQ ID NO: 95 and 96) and L521S (SEQ ID NO: 97 and 98) are highly expressed in lung squamous tumors, with L520S being up-regulated in normal salivary gland and L521S being over-expressed in normal skin. Both belong to a family of small proline rich proteins and represent markers for fully differentiated squamous cells. L521 S has been described as a specific marker for lung squamous tumor (Hu, R., et al, Lung Cancer, 20:25-30, 1998). L515S (SEQ ID NO: 162) encodes IGF-\u03b22 and L516S is an aldose reductase homologue. Both are moderately expressed in lung squamous tumors and in normal colon. Notably, L516S (SEQ ID NO: 91 and 92) is up-regulated in metastatic tumors but not primary lung adenocarcinoma, an indication of its potential role in metatasis and a potential prognostic marker. L522S (SEQ ID NO: 99) is moderately over-expressed in lung squamous tumors with minimum expression in normal tissues. L522S has been shown to belong to a class IV alcohol dehydrogenase, ADH7, and its expression ",

Ra12 compositions and methods for their use in enhancing expression of heterologous polynucleotide sequences are described in U.S. Patent Application 60/158,585, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Briefly, Ra12 refers to a polynucleotide region that is a subsequence of a Mycobacterium tuberculosis MTB32A nucleic acid. MTB32A is a serine protease of 32 KD molecular weight encoded by a gene in virulent and avirulent strains of M. tuberculosis. The nucleotide sequence and amino acid sequence of MTB32A have been described (for example, U.S. Patent Application 60/158,585; see also, Skeiky et al., Infection and Immun. (1999) 67:3998-4007, incorporated herein by reference). Surprisingly, it was discovered that a 14 KD C-terminal fragment of the MTB32A coding sequence expresses at high levels on its own and remains as a soluble protein throughout the purification process. Moreover, this fragment may enhance the immunogenicity of heterologous antigenic polypeptides with which it is fused. This 14 KD C-terminal fragment of the MTB32A is referred to herein as Ra12 and represents a fragment comprising some or all of amino acid residues 192 to 323 of MTB32A.</p>Recombinant nucleic acids which encode a fusion polypeptide comprising a Ra12 polypeptide and a heterologous lung tumor polypeptide of interest, can be readily constructed by conventional genetic engineering techniques. Recombinant nucleic acids are constructed so that, preferably, a Ra12 polynucleotide sequence is located 5\u2032 to a selected heterologous lung tumor polynucleotide sequence. It may also be appropriate to place a Ra12 polynucleotide sequence 3\u2032 to a selected heterologous polynucleotide sequence or to insert a heterologous polynucleotide sequence into a site within a Ra12 polynucleotide sequence.</p>In addition, any suitable polynucleotide that encodes a Ra12 or a portion or other variant thereof can be used in constructing recombinant fusion polynucleotides comprising Ra12 and one or more lung tumor polynucleotides disclosed herein.

The Lipofectamine/DMEM mixture was then added to 1 \u03bcg of L762P Flag/pCEP4 plasmid DNA resuspended in 100 ul DMEM and incubated for 15 minutes at RT. The Lipofectamine/DNA mix was then added to the HEK293 cells and incubated for 48-72 hours at 37\u00b0 C. with 7% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cells were rinsed with PBS, then collected and pelleted by centrifugation. Cells were then analyzed by FACS as above. Three of the L762P humAb bound to the mouse orthologue, see Table 26.</p>Affinity Analysis</p>Affinity of the L762P humAbs was determined using Biacore analysis (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden). Goat anti-human antibody was plated onto a CM5 sensor chip using routine amine coupling. HBS-P running buffer (Biacore) was then used to dilute the L762P humAbs to \u02dc1 ug/ml, and each L762P humAb was then captured to a separate channel on the sensor chip. A 5 minute wash was performed to stabilize the L762P humAb baseline reading. L762P antigen (amino acid residues 32-944 of SEQ ID NO:161, at a concentration of 393 nM) was then injected over those surfaces containing mAbs for 1 minute, followed by a 15 minute dissociation step. To regenerate the binding surface after each capture/inject cycle, a 21 second pulse of phosphoric acid (146 mM) was used. The resulting sensograms were then analyzed using the Biacore software and fitted to a 1:1 interaction model to determine relative values for Ka and Kd and are shown in Table 26.</p>Functional Activity</p>Analysis of apoptosis induction was carried out using L762P/522 or</p>L762P/343 transfected cells (2\u00d710<sup>5</sup>) as described above. The cells were incubated overnight with 10 \u03bcg/ml of the anti-L762P humAbs or irrelevant human IgG control mAbs, then assayed for annexin positivity and active caspase content by incubating the cells with an annexin V-Alexa488 conjugate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.). Cells were subjected to flow cytometric analysis to determine the amount of annexin positivity as a measure of induced apoptotic activity. Little to no detectable apoptosis above background levels was observed for the humAbs, see Table 26.</p>For anti-proliferation assays, L762P/522 or L762P/343 cells (500 cells/well) were plated onto 96 well plates and grown overnight at 37\u00b0 C., 7% CO<sub>2</sub>. The next day, 10-20 \u03bcg/ml of the L762P humAbs were added to the cells and incubated for 6 days at 37\u00b0 C., 7% CO<sub>2</sub>. The change in the amount of proliferation was quantitated by the addition of MTS reagent (20 \u03bcl/well; Promega, Madison, Wis.) for 1 to 2 hours, followed by reading the OD490 of the plate on a microplate ELISA reader. Little to no reduction in proliferation above background levels was observed for the L762P humAbs tested (see Table 26).</p>Internalization Analysis</p>L762P/522 cells were plated at 1\u00d710<sup>3 </sup>cells/well in 96 well plates containing DME plus 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine sera.

    "1 and human L762P humAbs (1.59.1, 2.39.3 and 2.110.1). The mAbs were radiolabeled with Iodine-125 (Amersham, Arlington Heights, Ill.) using the Iodogen method according to manufacturer's instructions (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.). The 153A12.1 mAb was also labeled with In-111 (Amersham) after the attachment of a chelator to facilitate Indium uptake. The labeled mAbs were diluted in binding buffer (PBS/0.5% BSA/1 mM sodium azide), then various concentrations of mAbs were added to wells of 96-well plates coated with 10 \u03bcg/ml of recombinant L762P protein (amino acid residues 32-944 of SEQ ID NO:161) or incubated with L762/343T cells.</p>To determine the total mAb binding, 10 \u03bcg/ml L762P antigen or 1\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>L762P/343T cells were incubated with a dilution series of a particular radiolabeled human or mouse L762P mAb. To determine non-specific binding, plate-bound L762P antigen or L762P/343T cells were incubated with a radiolabeled mAb in the presence of a 50\u00d7 excess of unlabeled antibody. After 2 to 4 hours incubation at room temperature, plates or cells are washed 4\u00d7 with cold binding buffer. Washed plates or cells collected by centrifugation were then subjected to a Gamma counter. The radioactive signal generated in the non-specific binding sample was subtracted from the signal derived from the total binding reaction to determine the specific binding signal. The data were analyzed by non-linear regression to determine affinity and number of antigen sites per cell. The derived Kd values are shown in Table 26 and are based on L762P recombinant antigen binding for all of the humAbs tested (1.59.1, 2.39.3 and 2.110.1), whereas the mouse L762P mAb (153A12.1) has an additional Kd value determination based on binding to L762P/343T cells.</p>Epitope Mapping Using mAbs</p>Peptide epitopes recognized by mouse monoclonal antibodies 153A12 and 153A20 and human monoclonal antibodies humAb 2.4.1 and humab 2.69.1, were identified using an epitope mapping approach. A series of overlapping 20 mer peptides corresponding to the full length amino acid sequence of L762P (SEQ ID NO: 161) were synthesized. As described above, the peptides were subjected to ELISA analysis. The 20 mer L762P peptides were coated onto flat bottom 96 well microtiter plates at 2 \u03bcg/ml and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 2 hours. Plates were then washed 5 times with PBS+0.1% Tween 20 and blocked with PBS+1% BSA for 1 hr. Protein A purified mouse or human anti-L762P antibodies were then added to the wells at 1 ug/ml and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Plates were again washed, followed by the addition of goat anti-mouse-Ig-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or goat anti-human-Ig-HRP antibody for 1 hour at room temperature. Plates were washed, then developed by the addition of the chromagenic substrate TMB Microwell Peroxidase Substrate (Biological Mimetics, Inc., Fredrick, Md.). The reaction was incubated 15 minutes at room temperature and stopped by the addition of 1 N sulfuric acid. Plates were read at OD450 in an automated plate reader.</p>The peptide sequence recognized by L762P mouse monoclonal antibodies 153A12 and 153A20 corresponded to aa residues 135-154 of SEQ ID NO:161, EGKYIHFTPNFL"
