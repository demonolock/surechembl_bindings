    "ximab Fab and its antigen, EGFR domain III, the other showing the cQFD meditope and cetuximab Fab, in which the cQFD meditope binds to the central cavity of the cetuximab Fab. The antigen, EGFR domain III, binds at the </p>complementarity determining regions at a significant distance from the meditope binding site. Figure 4B shows SDS-PAGE results on the left-hand side and the corresponding size exclusion chromatography results on the right-hand side. Size exclusion experiments of the individual components, Fab, EGFR domain III, and SMT-cQFD meditope, as well as an \n\n admixture of all three, indicate the formation of a hetero-trimeric complex that coeluted. The non-reducing SDS-PAGE gel shows the fraction that eluted first, indicating the presence of all three components within the new peak (the left-most peak for \"complex,\" shaded light gray) observed from the admixture. Figure 4C shows the results of a FACS analysis, indicating that the cQFD meditope bound to EGFR positive MD-MBA-468 cells only in the presence of cetuximab (arrows). The meditope alone or the meditope in the presence of M425, a murine EGFR antibody, did not bind. Figure 4D shows results of surface plasmon resonance experiments using a sensor chip coupled with a cetuximab scFv or Fab. The experiments indicate that saturation of the scFv could not be achieved at concentrations as high as 100 \u03bc\u039c of the cQFD meditope. The same experiments using the cetuximab Fab coupled sensor chip indicate full saturation. The dissociation constant from this experiment is 660 nM. Control SPR experiments (bottom panel) show that the cetuximab scFv readily binds to the soluble EGFR domain III fragment, indicating that the CDR loops were functional. </p>[0062] Figure 5 is a graph of fluorescence intensity compared to cell count and shows fluorescently-labeled cetuximab binding to MDA-MB-468 cells in the presence of cQFD. Cetuximab binds to MDA-MB-468 cells without meditope, and in the presence of 6 \u03bc\u039c and 60 \u03bc\u039c meditope. As expected, the Figure shows that there was no binding of the isotype IgG control to EGFR on MDA-MB468 cells. </p>[0063] Figure 6 shows how meditope and EGFR bind to distinct sites. The top images show superposition of the cQFD-Fab complex and the EGFR-Fab complex (1YY8) in stereo. The bottom images show that residues 39-46 of the heavy chain are flexible and accommodate the meditope. </p>[0064] Figure 7 shows Fab framework binders. Superposition of Fabs bound to meditope, Protein A, and Protein L indicate that each binds to a unique site on the cetuximab Fab. </p>[0065] Figure 8 illustrates a mechanism of action in one embodiment for enhancing tumor therapy. In the exemplified embodiment, bivalent antibodies bound to antigen (e.g., ErbB receptor family) overexpressed on tumor cells (left panel) and blocks receptor signaling, alters endocytosis and receptor recycling and/or elicits an immune response. The addition of an antibody such as matuzumab which recognizes a different domain o",
    " As demonstrated herein, the binding site for these meditopes on cetuximab also are distinct from the binding sites of other framework-binding antigens such as the superantigens Staphylococcal Protein A (SpA) and Peptostreptococcus magnus Protein L (PpL) (Figure 7). In certain aspects, the provided embodiments build upon this discovery, for example, by modifying other mAbs to allow their binding to these and other meditopes (i.e., \"meditope- enabling\") and generating variant meditopes and/or altered meditope-enabled antibodies, for example, those having altered properties, including improved binding affinity, toxicity, PK/PD, and/or pH dependence. </p>C. Meditope-enabled antibodies and complexes </p>[00175] Provided are meditope-enabled antibodies that are capable of binding to one or more meditopes via meditope-binding sites. In some cases, the meditope-enabled antibody binds to a cyclic peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 or 2 (meditope 1 or 2) and/or to one or more variants thereof, such as meditopes 1, 2, 16-18, 23, 29, 31, 32, 36, 39, 42, 43, 45, 46, 51, 52, 54, or 55 (meditopes based on peptides having the sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 1, 2, 16-18, 23, 29, 31, 32, 36, 39, 42, 43, 45, 46, 51, 52, 54, or 55), or in some cases, any of meditopes 1, 2, or 15-55. Among the provided meditope-enabled antibodies are those that \n\n bind to a meditope or meditopes with an affinity similar to that of cetuximab. For example, in certain aspects, the antibodies bind to the meditope(s) with a dissociation constant of less than at or about 10 \u03bc\u039c, less than at or about 5 \u03bc\u039c, or less than at or about 2 \u03bc\u039c, less than at or about 1 \u03bc\u039c, less than at or about 500, 400, 300, 200, 100 nM, or less, such as at or about 200 picomolar or less. In some cases, the dissociation constant, such as any of those listed herein, is that measured using a particular technique, such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), fluorescence, fluorescence polarization, NMR, IR, calorimetry titrations; kinetic exclusion; circular dichroism, differential scanning calorimetry, or other known method. For example, in some cases, the analog or meditope exhibits a binding constant of less than at or about 10 \u03bc\u039c, less than at or about 5 \u03bc\u039c, or less than at or about 2 \u03bc\u039c, less than at or about 1 \u03bc\u039c, less than at or about 500, 400, 300, 200, 100 nm, or less, as measured by SPR or as measured by ITC or as measured by any of these methods. </p>[00176] In some examples, the meditope-binding site is a structural feature of the monoclonal antibody, cetuximab, a human-murine chimeric antibody used for the treatment of EGFR-expressing metastatic colorectal cancer and head and neck cancers. Thus, in some cases, the meditope-binding site contains residues corresponding to those within the meditope binding site of cetuximab. In a study reported herein, x-ray crystallographic analysis has revealed that the peptides of SEQ ID NO: 1 binds to a meditope-binding site within the central cavity of the cetuximab Fab fragment, defined by various residues of the heavy and light chains (see Figures 1 and 4A), with a binding constant of -700 nM (see Figures 30A- 30B). </p>[00177] Several interactions between cetuximab 's meditope binding site and the cQFD</p>(SEQ ID NO: 1, meditope 1) and cQYN (SEQ ID NO: 2, meditope 2) meditopes are based on particular structural features of cetuximab, particularly within the framework and constant regions of the central cavity of the Fab fragment. The regions of cetuximab that constitute the meditope binding site are unique and appear to be the result of the chimeric nature of this antibody. Specifically, the Fab variable regions (Fvs) are murine and the Fab constant regions (CHI and CL) are human. The engineering of this Fab produced a combination of residues not found in a sequence alignment of murine and human chimeric antibodies. For example, data herein show that the meditopes did not bind to fully human IgG framework (e.g., trastuzumab), to other chimeric antibodies such as rituximab (Figure 29), or to mouse \n\n antibodies, confirming that the cetuximab meditope-binding site is highly specific. In addition to these results, superposition of the molecular structure of trastuzumab (1N8Z; Cho et al., Nature, \"Structure of the extracellular region of HER2 alone and in complex with the Herceptin Fab,\" 2003 Feb 13;421(6924):756-60) and rituxumab (20SL;Du et al., J Biol Chem, 2007 May 18;282(20): 15073-80. Epub 2007 Mar 29) Fabs on to the meditope bound cetuximab Fab structure further highlighted the uniqueness of the framework. Superposition of multiple ",
    "y in combination with a meditope-enabled antibody. In some aspects, the multivalent meditopes provide advantages compared to use of a second antibody recognizing a separate epitope. For example, production of the multivalent meditopes can be more efficient, and cost-effective when compared to a second antibody. For example, although a number of preclinical/clinical trials are investigating the coadministration of two monoclonal antibodies, the costs of producing and marketing such a therapeutic is likely to be prohibitive. In some aspects, the multivalent meditopes also are comparatively more easily targeted to disease sites, such as tumors. Given the nature of the meditope binding site (within the meditope binding site, separate from the antibody CDRs), and the broadly applicable methods provided herein for meditope-enabling any antibody of choice, the multivalent meditopes also have the advantage of being readily applicable to a large range of therapeutic antibodies, without the need to identify a second antibody or \n\n epitope with therapeutically acceptable characteristics. Thus, in some aspects, use of a multivalent meditope avoids the need to identify a second mAb with acceptable </p>characteristics, and the associated and significant cost of its development thereof. </p>[00255] Specificity and affinity are often achieved through multivalency. For a bivalent ligand with a linker, this can be expressed as AGi tai = AGl + AG2 - AGun<sub>k</sub>er- hi other words, Kxotai = Ki*K2/Kii<sub>nker</sub>- In the case where the linker makes no contribution to the free energy ~ 1), the apparent affinity of the bivalent ligand for the bivalent target is the product of the monomeric binding constants. Thus, significant gains in affinity can be achieved through multivalency in general (e.g., for a meditope with K<sub>D</sub> = 1 \u03bc\u039c, the affinity of a 'theoretical' bivalent meditope is 1 pM). While such large gains are rarely seen in general (primarily due to the geometry of bivalent/trivalent/multivalent receptors), synergy is observed. The geometry of a cell surface-expressed antigen can place strict constraints on the linker of a multivalent meditope, but can also ensure specificity, which can be an important goal in some contexts, such as for targeted delivery, e.g., by minimizing the risk of off-target effects. </p>[00256] In one example, the multivalent meditope contains an Fc region of an antibody or portion thereof, such as substantially all of the Fc region. The use of the Fc region to 'dimerize' ligands is established and described, for example, by Jazayeri JA &amp; Carroll GJ., \"Fc -based cytokines: prospects for engineering superior therapeutics,\" BioDrugs, 22(1): 11-26 (2008) In some examples, to generate a bivalent meditope, the meditope is fused to an Fc region (e.g., to the N-terminus of the Fc region of an IgG) through a linker, typically a peptide linker, e.g., a flexible peptide linker. In one example, the length of the linker is chosen t",
    ", to facilitate such conjugation, one or more lysines in the Protein L fusion are mutated, for example, to arginine or asparagine, to generate a Protein L fusion protein that can be specifically conjugated to other molecules, for example, by leaving the N-terminal amine and the epsilon amine available for conjugation, \n\n the latter being solvent exposed and more reactive. An exemplary fusion protein has the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 59(SCQFDLSTRRLRCGGGGSEVTIRVN LIFADGNIQTAEFRGTFEEATAEAYRYAALLARVNGEYTAD LEDGGNHMNIKFA G), in which all lysines but one have been removed. </p>[00270] The coding sequence of an exemplary meditope-Protein L fusion protein is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 56. The sequence of exemplary meditope-Protein L fusion proteins are set forth in SEQ ID NO: 57 (His6-Smt3-meditope-ProteinL) and SEQ ID NO: 58 (containing two cysteins, set forth in bold text, which in some aspects are used to cyclize the MPL, e.g., by peroxide or overnight with air: </p> SCQFDLSTRRLKCGGGGSEVTIKVNLIFADGKIQTAEFKGTFEEATAEAYRYAALLA KVNGEYTADLEDGGNHMNIKFAG (SEQ ID NO: 58). </p>[00271] In some embodiments, the meditope-Protein L (MPL) construct exhibits improved binding affinity for a meditope-enabled antibody as compared to meditope alone. For example, the improvement can be an at least or an at or about 10,000, 9000, 8000, 7000, 6000, 5000, 4000, 3000, 2000, 1000, 900, 800, 700, 600, 500, 400, 300, 200, 100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, or 10-fold improvement in affinity, e.g., in dissociation constant, for the meditope-enabled antibody as compared with the corresponding meditope alone and/or with the Protein L alone. In one example, the binding constants for interactions between Protein L and the meditope alone with the meditope-enabled antibody are approximately 0.5 \u03bc\u039c and 1 \u03bc\u039c, respectively, whereas the binding constant for the MPL to the antibody is approximately 165 pM. </p>IV. Meditope-agent conjugates </p>[00272] In certain embodiments, the meditopes, including one or more meditope, meditope variants, multivalent meditopes, meditope-Protein L fusions (MPLs), multivalent tethering agents or multivalent meditope variant tethering agents are conjugated to one or more therapeutic or diagnostic agent, e.g., imaging agents, therapeutically effective agents or compounds in therapeutically effective amounts or both. Provided are such complexes containing the meditope and one or more agent. </p>[00273] In some aspects, the binding of the meditopes or variants thereof to one or more meditope-enabled antibody conjugated to a therapeutic or diagnostic (e.g., imaging) agent or compound is used to treat, prevent, diagnose or monitor a disease or condition. In \n\n one aspect, such conjugation of a meditope, such as a multivalent meditope, to an agent, when used in connection with meditope-enabled monoclonal antibodies, provides a highly versatile platform technology that will significantly improve mAb based therapeutics and imaging methods to treat and detect disease (see Figure 8). </p>[00274] The diagnostic and therapeutic agents include any such agent, which are well- known in the relevant art. Among the imaging agents are fluorescent and luminescent substances, including, but not limited to, a variety of organic or inorganic small molecules commonly referred to as \"dyes,\" \"labels,\" ",
    "e and inactive nuclei (e.g., \n\n <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>15</sup>N and <sup>2</sup>H), multiple NMR experiments performed to assign the spectrum, and then used with the fragment library to identify the binding position. </p>Virtual ligand screening </p>[00320] Virtual ligand screening is another method that can be used to identify lead meditope analogs, fragments, and other compounds. Using crystal structures, standard programs (e.g., Schroerdinger Glide) can define a \"box' about a site of a macromolecule (the meditope binding site) and dock known ligands to this site. Potential lead compounds are scored by a select energy function and the top 50 to 200 compounds can be purchased. In our initial studies, approximately 100 lead compounds have been identified, and using crystallography, these lead compounds should be shown to demonstrate that they bind to the meditope site. </p>[00321] In one embodiment, a method of screening for meditopes or meditope analogs is provided herein. Such a method may include, but is not limited to, steps of contacting a library of putative meditopes or small molecules with a meditope-enabled antibody; </p>determining whether the putative meditopes of small molecules bind the meditope-enabled antibody at a framework binding interface; identifying one or more candidate meditopes or meditope analogs; determining binding affinity of the one or more candidates; and identifying one or more of the candidates as a meditope or meditope analogs when the binding dissociation constant is less than 0.70 \u03bc\u039c. In other contexts, a low affinity meditope is desired, such that a minimum dissociation constant is specified, for example, 0.70 \u03bc\u039c. In some examples, the candidate is identified as a meditope or analog thereof if it exhibits binding constant of less than at or about 10 \u03bc\u039c, less than at or about 5 \u03bc\u039c, or less than at or about 2 \u03bc\u039c, less than at or about 1 \u03bc\u039c, less than at or about 500, 400, 300, 200, 100 nm, or less. In some cases, the dissociation constant, such as any of those listed herein, is that measured using a particular technique, such as SPR, Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC), fluorescence, fluorescence polarization, NMR, IR, calorimetry titrations; kinetic exclusion; circular dichroism, differential scanning calorimetry, or other known method. For example, in some cases, the analog or meditope exhibits a binding constant of less than at or about 10 \u03bc\u039c, less than at or about 5 \u03bc\u039c, or less than at or about 2 \u03bc\u039c, less than at or about 1 \u03bc\u039c, less than at or about 500, 400, 300, 200, 100 nm, or less, as measured by SPR or as measured by ITC or as measured by any of these methods. \n\n [00322] Additionally, methods of screening for novel framework binding interfaces are also provided, and are described further in the examples below. </p> [00323] In another embodiment, provided is a method for identifying and optimizing fragments useful in connection with the meditopes, such as in building meditope analogs and/or in coupling to the meditopes to improve their function. Also provided are such analogs and fragments and compounds. </p> [00324] Having described the invention with reference to the embodiments and illustrative examples, those in the art may appreciate modifications to the invention as described and illustrated that do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention as disclosed in the specification. The Examples are set forth to aid in understanding the invention but are not intended to, and should not be construed to limit its scope in any way.

    "oint mutations in the cQFD meditope were generated at residues 3 (Phe3 to Ala), 5 (Leu5 to Ala), 8 (Arg8 to Ala) and 10 (LeulO to Ala) and were produced bacterially by encoding the peptides at the C-terminus of SMT3 (Mossessova et al., 2000). Before surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis, ubiquitin-like protease (Ulpl) was added to the samples to release the peptides. An N- terminal serine residue remained as a remnant of the protease cleavage site. </p>Simultaneous binding of EGFR and meditope to Fab </p>[00353] The cetuximab Fab was incubated with sEGFRdlll and cQFD and applied to an analytical SEC column. A peak at 13.9 mL was observed, indicating the formation of a \n\n heterotrimeric complex between these three components. Non-reducing SDS-PAGE of the peak showed the presence of all three components (Figure 4B). In comparison, the individual components eluted at 15.2 mL (Fab C225), 15.6 mL (sEGFRdlll) and 16.3 mL (SMT- CQFDLS TRRLKC ; SEQ ID NO: l). The results showed that the meditopes and EGFR could bind to cetuximab simultaneously, indicating that meditope binding did not occlude antigen binding by cetuximab. </p>[00354] In addition, Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements were used to confirm that the meditope did not affect antigen binding by cetuximab. The fluorescent signal emitted from Alexfluor 488 -labeled cetuximab Fab was quenched upon binding of Alexafluor 555 -labeled sEGFRdlll. Titration of labeled cetuximab with labeled sEGFRdlll afforded a binding constant of 20 nM, essentially the same value as was observed using SPR (data not shown). To test for allostery, labeled cetuximab Fab was incubated with sEGFRdlll at concentrations ranging from 5 to 1000 nM in the presence of the cQFD meditope (66 \u03bc\u039c). The experiment was performed in triplicate. Similar to the SEC studies, no substantial change in the binding constant of the Fab-sEGFRdlll interaction was observed. </p>[00355] Taken together, these biochemical studies indicate that the meditope-Fab interaction does not substantially affect antigen binding. These observations are similar to results with Protein L and Protein A, which also bind to the Fab framework region without affecting antigen binding to Fab. cQFD meditope does not bind to CDR loops of cetuximab </p>[00356] To further confirm that the meditopes did not bind to CDRs, binding between the cQFD meditope and the scFv fragment of cetuximab was assessed. In the scFv, the CDR loops remain intact, but the Fab variable domains are directly connected through a short peptide linker, eliminating the Fab constant domains. In other words, much of the meditope binding pocket is eliminated in the scFv, while the CDRs are minimally affected. SPR demonstrated that EGFR domain III and the cQFD meditope bound to cetuximab Fab tethered to a CM5 chip (See Figure 4D). In addition, EGFR domain III bound with a minimal affinity loss to the scFv tethered to a second CM5 chip. However, relative to Fab binding, the cQFD meditope did not saturate the scFv at concentrations as high as 100 \u03bc\u039c of meditope. This indicates minimal, if any, affinity of the meditope for the CDRs, consistent with the crystallographic studies. \n\n cQFD meditope binding does not affect cetuximab binding to EGFR-expressing cells </p>[00357] As described above, the cetuximab Fab could bind to the cQFD meditope and",
    "these data demonstrate that the affinity of the meditope-memAb interaction can be tailored to pH, which is used, for example, to generate meditope variants for the specific release at low pH, such as in lysozymes for drug delivery, and/or to bind with higher affinity in a hypoxic environment, e.g., tumor stroma. </p>EXAMPLE 9: MEDITOPE ANALOGS, FRAGMENTS, AND OTHER COMPOUNDS </p>[00447] Screening methods were carried out to identify meditope analogs and compounds, such as small molecules, fragments, aptamers, nucleic acid molecules, peptibodies and/or other substances that bind meditope-enabled antibodies near meditope - binding sites and in some aspects can be linked to meditopes, for example, to improve their affinities for the meditope-binding sites. </p>[00448] Fluorescence polarization assays: To identify compounds, including alternative molecules that could bind at the meditope binding site of meditope-enabled antibodies and thus be used for similar functions, a displacement assay was established. A cyclic meditope was synthesized and chemically attached to a fluorescein, generating a fluorescein-labeled meditope of the following sequence: AcCQFDLSTRRLRCGGGSK (SEQ ID NO: 31, cysteines form a disulfide linkage)-Fluorescein. This fluorescently-labeled peptide was then titrated with cetuximab and the fluorescence polarization measured. The interaction between the labeled meditope and mAb cause a change in the fluorescence polarization/intensity of the fluorescent tag. The dissociation constant, 1 \u03bc\u039c, closely matched values obtained from surface plasmon resonance and isothermal titration calorimetry. A non-labeled meditope, AcCQFDLSTRRLRCGGGSK (SEQ ID NO: 31), was used to displace the fluorescein-label peptide pre-bound to cetuximab. The fluorescence polarization was monitored. Compounds that blocked the meditope- antibody interaction altered the fluorescent polarization properties. As shown in Figure 37, a sigmoid curve indicative of a competition reaction was observed. Accordingly, this method is useful for identifying meditope analogs. </p>[00449] Based on these data, an initial screen to identify small molecules capable of displacing the meditope was carried out. In this study, 42 lead compounds at concentrations \n\n of 50 \u03bc\u039c were identified from a library of 30,000 small molecule compounds. Figure 38 shows five such lead compounds. </p>[00450] In another example, these compounds are characterized further, for example, by crystallography. </p>[00451] Diffraction methods. Cetuximab Fab was shown to diffract beyond 2.5 A, as shown above. Established diffraction-based methods (well-established for identifying lead compounds (Shuker et al. 1996; Erlanson et al. 2001 ; Hughes et al. 2011)) were used to identify candidate compounds, including compounds that can be coupled to a meditope, for example, to improve affinity for the meditope binding site. A library of small molecules was developed to soak into crystals of cetuximab. Diffraction data fro",
    "b (grey cartoon) and meditope-enabled trastuzumab Fab. </p>[00459] To generate a meditope that binds to meditope-enabled antibodies with greater affinity via energy additivity, a meditope-Protein L fusion polypeptide was produced. Based on structural data information, four glycines were introduced to link the C-terminus of the cQFD meditope and the N-terminus of Protein L. The coding sequence of a meditope- Protein L fusion protein is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 56. </p>[00460] The amino acid sequence of an encoded protein, including a His6-Smt3 tag (plain text), meditope (underlined), and Protein L (bold) is set forth below and in SEQ ID NO: 57: \n\n \u03a0 \u03a0 \u0397\u03a0 \u03a0 \u03a0\u0397\u039d\u03af :; \u039b \u0397\u00b7 :. i ; A \\1M V \\{ ); A K rr V KrEV H .

The binding constant for the interaction between Protein L and the meditope-enabled trastuzumab was approximately 0.5 \u03bc\u039c. For the interaction between the meditope and the meditope-enabled trastuzumab Fab fragment, it was approximately 1 \u03bc\u039c. The binding constant for the interaction between the meditope- Protein L fusion protein and the IgG, however, was 165 pM. Figure 53 shows surface plasmon resonance (SPR) data for a meditope-Protein L fusion (MPL): The top panel shows the traces of MPL being added to the meditope-enabled trastuzumab at concentrations up to 10 nM. The fit data indicates a binding affinity of 165 pM. The bottom panel shows the traces of Protein L (only) added at the same concentrations to the meditope-enabled trastuzumab, showing that there was no binding at this concentration in this study. This result demonstrated far stronger binding between the fusion protein and meditope-enabled antibody compared to the individual interactions, indicating improved affinity via additivity. </p>[00463] Point mutations were created in Protein L and the meditope to ensure specificity. As expected, in both cases, the binding constant was reduced. </p>[00464] To facilitate conjugation of various molecules, such as therapeutic and diagnostic agents, e.g., cytotoxins, radionucleotides, for example, DOTA, proteins, solid supports, and other molecules, e.g., for drug delivery, imaging, or purification, all lysines in the Protein L-meditope fusion protein but one were mutated to arginine or another residue. The crystal structure shown in Figure 52 was used to identify all lysines on Protein L and the meditope that, if conjugated, would sterically occlude the meditope-Protein L / meditope- \n\n enabled antibody interaction. Based on this information, the meditope-Protein L fusion (MPL) having the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 59 </p> (SCQFDLSTRRLRCGGGGSEVTIRVNLIFADGNIQTAEFRGTFEEATAEAYRYAALLA RVNGEYTADLEDGGNHMNIKFAG) was produced, in which certain lysines in Protein L/meditope (shown in black in Figure 52 - all but one lysine) were mutated to Arg or Asn. In the sequence shown above, the residues mutated from lysine to arginine/asparagine are shown in bold text. The lysine that was not mutated (underlined above) is pointed into the solvent. Thus, in the resulting meditope-Protein L fusion protein, the N-terminal amine and epsilon amine were left for conjugation, the latter being solvent exposed and likely more reactive. </p>[00465] In another example, this unique lysine residue in this mutant is used to PEGylate the MPL, e.g., to address potential antigenicity. </p>MPL-DOTA-NHS conjugates </p>[00"
