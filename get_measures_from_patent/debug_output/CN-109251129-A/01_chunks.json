    "r/min, and supernatant is tyrosinase crude enzyme liquid, and 4 DEG C save, and are finished in 2h.</p>3, inhibition of the sample to tyrosinase activity</p>Overall reaction system is 5mL, design such as following table.When wherein, with spectrophotometer measurement light absorption value, \" by test solution \", \" mark\nQuasi- control \", \" positive control \" are respectively with \" negative control 1 \", \" negative control 2 \" and \" negative control 3 \" zeroing.</p></p>In this system, by test solution (including positive control arbutin) final concentration (mg/mL) gradient be 0.015625,\n0.03125,0.0625,0.125,0.25 and 0.5.</p>When experiment, sequentially added into test tube phosphate buffer, various concentration gradient it is (including positive right by test solution\nAccording to) and enzyme solution, in 30 DEG C of water-bath 10min.Then substrate l-tyrosine is added, immediately begins to timing.When measurement reaction 20min\nLight absorption value under 475nm wavelength.Using corresponding negative control as reference when measurement, calculated with following equation by test solution (including sun\nProperty control) to the inhibiting rate of tyrosinase.Inhibiting rate (%)=(A-B) \u00f7 A \u00d7 100%</p>Wherein, \" A \" is the light absorption value of standard control, and \" B \" is the light absorption value by test solution (or positive control).Each experiment is done\n3 parallel.According to inhibiting rate, with Bliss ' s software calculation of half inhibitory concentration (IC50) value.</p>Three, experimental result</p>The positive control and compound of test see the table below to the IC50 value of tyrosinase inhibitory action and Fig. 2.</p></p>Known positive control arbutin is widely used in whitening and washes in shield daily use chemicals, is derived from the natural active products of green plants\nMatter, collection \" green plants, safe and reliable \" and \" efficient decolorizing \" three close it is humorous be unified in integrated skin bleaching component, it can be rapid\nSkin is penetrated into, without affecting the cell proliferation concentration, the activity of the tyrosinase in skin can be effectively inhibited, blocked black\nThe formation of pigment, is directly binded to tyrosinase by itself, accelerates the decomposition and excretion of melanin, so that it is heavy to reduce skin pigment\nProduct, dispelling stain and freckle, and do not generate the side effects such as toxic, irritation, sensitization to melanocyte, while also\nIt sterilizes, the effect of anti-inflammatory.It is the current popular the most safely and effectively desired skin of whitening raw materials and 21st century\nWhitening active agent.The study found that \u03b2-santal terpenes, table-\u03b2-santal terpenes, climing wrinkled giant hyssop ketenes, climing wrinkled giant hyssop alkanone, Jiang Huasu\nA, rosemary amine, different rosemary amine, rose spirocyclic ketoenols, \u03b1-panacene, \u03b2-panacene are with similar or more excellent to arbutin\nTyrosinase inhibitory activity, whitening wash shield daily use chemicals in have extremely wide application prospect.</p>A kind of embodi"
