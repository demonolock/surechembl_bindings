    "DM6-F peptide (0.001 \u03bcM) mix in Dynex 96 hole dark circles base plate (FisherScientific), thus obtain the final volume of 125 \u03bc l.For each test, all comprise binding peptide contrast (being equivalent to 0% suppression) comprising MDM2 albumen and PMDM6-F and the free peptide only comprising free PMDM6-F contrast (being equivalent to 100% suppression).In cultivation after 3 hours, when this combination reaches balance, measure its polarization value with ULTRA READER (Tecan U.S.Inc., Research Triangle Park, NC).Analyze cause one figure with nonlinear least square method and measure its IC\n        <sub>50</sub>value (inhibitor concentration that its binding peptide of lower 50% is replaced).Curve fit is carried out with GRAPHPAD PRISM software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA).\n      </p>In order to calculate the avidity constant (K of inhibitor\n        <sub>i</sub>), use set up for calculating K in the binding tests based on FP\n        <sub>i</sub>equation below value:\n      </p>K\n        <sub>i</sub>\uff1d[I]\n        <sub>50</sub>/([L]\n        <sub>50</sub>/K\n        <sub>d</sub>+[P]\n        <sub>0</sub>/K\n        <sub>d</sub>+1)\n      </p>Wherein [I]\n        <sub>50</sub>represent the concentration of free inhibitor under suppressing 50%, [L]\n        <sub>50</sub>represent the concentration of the free ligand marked under suppressing 50%, [P]\n        <sub>0</sub>represent the concentration of floating preteins under suppressing 0%, and K\n        <sub>d</sub>represent the dissociation constant of protein-iigand complex.In order to the K with shown equation accurate calculation inhibitor\n        <sub>i</sub>value, establishes a kind of computation process to calculate the exact value (Nikolovska-Coleska et al, Anal.Biochem.332:261 (2004)) of required all parameters in this equation.Also establish the K that a kind of (web-based) computer program based on network comes according to the inhibitor in the binding tests of identical Equation for Calculating based on FP\n        <sub>i</sub>value.\n      </p>Peptide based on fluorescently-labeled p53 and MDM2 have the K of 1nM\n        <sub>d</sub>value, it is consistent with its reported before report having high affinity to MDM2 people such as (, Med.Chem 43:3205 (2000)) Garcia-Echeverria.In this binding tests, record and be used as the natural p53 peptide (residue 13-29) of positive control and the K of 1a\n        <sub>i</sub>value is respectively 6.7 \u03bcMs and 8.5 \u03bcMs (Fig. 5).Therefore, 1a is the interactional inhibitor of a kind of highly effective p53-MDM2.\n      </p>Show, in order to interact better with MDM2, can be optimized 1a further to the analysis (Fig. 2) that the 1a pattern be combined with MDM2 is carried out.Such as, the benzyl ring of 1a with combined by the hydrophobicity binding pocket that the side chain of Phe19 occupies, but in this bag, still also have some spaces.Similarly, the isobutyl-of 1a is filled with the hydrophobicity binding pocket occupied by Leu26, but it can hold larg"
