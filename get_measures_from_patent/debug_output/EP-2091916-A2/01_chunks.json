Such conjoint treatment may be achieved by way of the simultaneous, sequential or separate dosing of the individual components of the treatment. Such combination products employ the compounds of this invention within the dosage range described hereinbefore \n\nand the other pharmaceutically-active agent within its approved dosage range.</p>\n  Biological Activity</p>\n  The following assays can be used to measure the effects of the compounds of the present invention as a5bl integrin inhibitors.</p>\n  (a) In vitro Binding Assay</p>\n  The assay determined the ability of compounds to inhibit binding of \u03b15\u03b2l integrin to a cognate ligand, a fragment of human fibronectin. The assay used Origen technology (IGEN International) to measure the compound activity. Briefly, \u03b15\u03b2l integrin was coated onto epoxy-paramagnetic beads (Dynal Biotech UK, Bromborough, Wirral, CH62 3QL, UK, Catalogue No 143.02) and biotinylated-fibronectin ligand was coupled to strepatividin labelled BV-Tag-NHS-Ester (BioVeris Corporation, Witney, Oxfordshire, 0X28 4GE, UK, Catalogue No JSF396). The ruthenium-labelled BV-Tag emits a electrochemiluminescence signal upon stimulation which is detected by the Origen reader. Thus, interaction of integrin and ligand causes association of bead and tag, and the resulting electrochemiluminescence signal reflects the level of integrin interaction with fibronectin.</p>\n  12\u03bcg of human \u03b15\u03b2l purified from placenta (Chemicon, Chandlers Ford, Hampshire, SO53 4NF, UK, Catalogue No CC1055-K) was coated onto surface-activated 3mg of epoxy-paramagnetic beads in PBS and IM ammonium sulfate following manufacturers instructions at 4<sup>0</sup>C for 24 hours. Coated beads were then washed into Assay Buffer (25mM Hepes, 15OmM NaCl, ImM MgCl, 1 mM MnCl, 0.1% Tween, pH7.4) to give a final concentration of 20\u03bcg of \u03b15\u03b2l/ ml. Immediately prior to the assay, the beads were further diluted x40 fold in Assay Buffer to give a concentration of 0.5\u03bcg \u03b15\u03b2l/ ml. A DNA fragment encoding the domains 9-10 (amino"
