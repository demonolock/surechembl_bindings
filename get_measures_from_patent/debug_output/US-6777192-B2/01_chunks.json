    "ated and morphologically similar genera of protozoa, Toxoplasma, Hammondia and Sarcocystis.</p>In addition, partial sequences (500-550 base pairs) of the 5\u2032 end of the nuclear small subunit (nss)-rRNA gene for three of the bovine Neospora isolates (BPA1, BPA3 and BPA5) have been obtained and shown to be identical. The more complete 1.8 kilobase sequence of the nss-rRNA gene of the BPA1 isolate was obtained and compared to the sequences for this gene in other coccidial parasites. Alignment of these sequences with published sequences of Neospora caninum, Cryptosporidium parvum, Sarcocystis muris and Toxoplasma gondii showed that the bovine Neospora isolate is genotypically unique.</p>As explained in detail below, the isolates are used to develop a variety of diagnostic assays as well as pharmaceutical compositions for treatment and prevention of infection.</p>Preparation of Neospora Polypeptides and Nucleic Acids</p>Standard protein purification techniques can be used to isolate proteins from the tachyzoites or bradyzoites derived from the cultures provided here. Such techniques include selective precipitation with such substances as ammonium sulfate, column chromatography, immunopurification methods, and the like. See, for instance, R. Scopes, Protein Purification: Principles and Practice, Springer-Verlag: New York (1982).</p>Using standard immunoblot techniques 11 proteins with molecular weights of approximately 106, 49.5, 48, 33, 32.5, 30, 28, 26, 19, 18 and 17 kilodaltons (kd) have been identified. All of these proteins are specifically recognized by antibodies from Neospora infected cattle. Standard protein purification methods can be used to purify these proteins and produce polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies for use in the diagnostic methods described below. Two of these antigens (approximately 106 and 19 kd) have been shown to be useful in enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISA) for the detection of Neospora-specific antibodies in infected cattle.</p>Rather than extract the proteins directly from cultured tachyzoites, one of skill will recognize that nucleic acids derived from the cultures can be used for recombinant expression of immunodominant antigens of the invention both presently known and unknown. In these methods, e.g., cDNA libraries are created from cultured tachyzoites. The libraries are screened for immunodominant antigens, either through, for example, selective hybridization to nucleic acids which encode known immunodominant antigens or by expression screening. In expression screening, the cDNA libraries are screened for the presence of immunodominant antigens using antibodies raised against the tachyzoite of interest. By using these methods, immunodominant antigens from different cultures or species of Neospora can be identified.</p>After candidate cDNA is identified, the nucleic acids encoding the proteins of interest are introduced into suitable host cells, followed by induction of the cells to produce large amounts of the protein. The isolation of two exemplary nucleic acids is described in Example 6, below. The invention relies on routine techniques in the field of recombinant genetics, well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. A basic text disclosing the general methods of use in this invention is Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, ",
    "f the antisera to enrich for antibodies reactive to Neospora proteins can be done if desired. (See Harlow and Lane, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Pubs., N.Y. (1988)).</p>Polyclonal antisera to the BPA1 and BPA3 isolates have been produced and evaluated. The polyclonal antisera are used to identify and characterize Neospora tachyzoite and bradyzoite stages in the tissues of infected animals using, for instance, immunoperoxidase test procedures described in Anderson et al. JAVMA 198:241 (1991) and Barr et al. Vet. Pathol. 28:110-116(1991).</p>Monoclonal antibodies may be obtained by various techniques familiar to those skilled in the art. Briefly, spleen cells from an animal immunized with a desired antigen are immortalized, commonly by fusion with a myeloma cell (See, Kohler and Milstein, Eur. J. Immunol. 6:511-519 (1976)). Alternative methods of immortalization include transformation with Epstein Barr Virus, oncogenes, or retroviruses, or other methods well known in the art. Colonies arising from single immortalized cells are screened for production of antibodies of the desired specificity and affinity for the antigen, and yield of the monoclonal antibodies produced by such cells may be enhanced by various techniques, including injection into the peritoneal cavity of a vertebrate host.</p>For instance, the BPA1 isolate has been used to immunize mice to obtain sensitized B cells for hybridoma production. Using these cells, monoclonal antibodies to the 48 kd and 70 kd Neospora proteins have been obtained. The monoclonal antibodies produced are used, for instance, in ELISA diagnostic tests, immunohistochemical tests, for the in vitro evaluation of parasite invasion, to select candidate antigens for vaccine development, protein isolation, and for screening genomic and cDNA libraries to select appropriate gene sequences.</p>Diagnosis of Neospora Infections</p>The present invention also provides methods for detecting the presence or absence of Neospora in a biological sample. For instance, antibodies specifically reactive with Neospora can be detected using either proteins or the isolates described here. The proteins and isolates can also be used to raise specific antibodies (either monoclonal or polyclonal) to detect the antigen in a sample. In addition, the nucleic acids disclosed and claimed here can be used to detect Neospora-specific sequences using standard hybridization techniques. Each of these assays is described below.</p>A. Immunoassays</p>For a review of immunological and immunoassay procedures in general, see Basic and Clinical Immunology 7th Edition (D. Stites and A. Terr ed.) 1991. The immunoassays of the present invention can be performed in any of several configurations, which are reviewed extensively in Enzyme Immunoassay, E. T. Maggio, ed., CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla.

    "ion are the tetrapeptides, HP(H/Y)P (SEQ ID NO: 14) and SPP(E/Q) (SEQ ID NO:15), which occur four times each within the 135 amino acid sequence and the sequence, SY(A/P)P(D/E)PS (SEQ ID NO:17), which contains conserved substitutions.</p>Unlike clone N54, clone N57 (SEQ ID NO:11) contained a 3\u2032 stop codon and a long poly A tail; however, because of difticulties in sequencing the repetitive noncoding region, only the coding sequences are shown (SEQ ID NO:12). While this partial clone did not have any discernible peptide repeats within its 76 amino acid and the complete 3\u2032 end of the NC-p65 cDNA were generated. Nucleotide sequencing of these products was completed.</p>Clones N54 and N57 hybridized to bands of different molecular weights on Southern blots of Neospora (BPA-1) DNA, indicating that the clones were derived from separate Neospora genes. Clone N54 showed some hybridization to a higher molecular weight band of Toxoplasma gondii DNA, whereas clone N57 did not bind to Toxoplasma DNA or to Vero DNA.</p>Northern blots with the same probes also showed that both clones recognized different molecular weight RNA transcripts and thus, encoded distinct Neospora proteins. Clone N54 bound to a 4.2 kb Neospora transcript, while clone N57 bound to a shorter 1.4 kb transcript. Neither clones hybridized to Toxoplasma gondii RNA or Vero RNA.</p>When clones N54 and N57 were expressed as histidine fusion proteins from the pRSET vectors, the resulting protein product of clone N54 was 29.3 kD whereas the protein product of clone N57 was 20.1 kD. By Western blot analysis, both proteins were recognized by rabbit antisera to BPA1 and not by rabbit Toxoplasma gondii antisera (data not shown). This suggests that the recombinant antigens are more diagnostically useful than the whole lysate which did have some reactivity to rabbit Toxoplasma gondii antisera.</p>In addition, polyclonal monospecific antisera to clones N54 and N57 only bound to Neospora antigens on reducing and nonreducing western blots. Rabbit anti-N54 recognized Neospora bands of molecular weights 97.2 kD, 87.9 kD, 77.1 kD, 67.4 kD, 64.3 kD, 60.1 kD, 55.3 kD, and 28.3-28 (reducing) and 126.7 kD, 89.4 kD, 68.7 kD, 58.4 kD, 55.2 kD, 54.5 kD, 52.7 kD, 49.7 kD, 46.7 kD and 26.5-27.9 (nonreducing). Rabbit anti -N57 recognized Neospora bands to molecular weights 33.6 kD, 31.4 kD 27.5 kD, and 22.4 kD (reducing) and 32.8 kD, 30.6 kD, 28.4 kD, 26.3 kD, and 21.0 kD (nonreducing). Neither polyclonal antisera bound to Toxoplasma gondii antigens nor to Vero cell antigens, making these two recombinant antigens promising candidates for a highly specific ELISA.</p>Conclusion</p>Current ELISA protocols require the use of in vitro cultivated of Neospora tachyzoites for coating antigens. (Pare, et al., J. Vet. Diag. Invest., 7:352-9 (1995); Bjorkiman, et al., Parasite Immunology, 16:643-8). When using such a crude mixture of antigens, one runs the risk of generating false positives due to crossreactivity between proteins from closely related parasites. By using one or two Neospora specific recombinant antigens in an ELISA, potentially crossreactive antigens are removed. In addition, the use of whole parasites requires time consuming and expensive tissue culture methods.</p>Example 7This example discloses the cloning of the full-length cDNA, known as NC-p65, that includes the N54 fragment.</p>Neospora (BPA-1 isolate) tachyzoites were grown in tissue culture as previously described, except that tachyzoites were grown on Vero cells. (Conrad, et al., Parasitology 106:239 (1993)). Briefly, for purification of the parasites, tachyzoites and Vero cells were scraped off the tissue culture flask, centrifuged, resuspended in 3 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS), passed three times through a 22-gauge needle to release the tachyzoites from the feeder cells, and passed through a PD-10 column filled with PBS-equilibrated Sephadex G25M (Pharmacia).
