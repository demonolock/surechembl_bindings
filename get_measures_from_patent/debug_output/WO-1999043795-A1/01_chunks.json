    "roduce viral particles containing the amy RNA into the supernatant. The amphotropic viral envelope protein of these particles allows entry into cells of most species including the PG13 packaging cells in a process called trans-infection. Empirically it has been determined that trans-infection produces PG13 clones with a higher rate of particle production as compared to PG13 clones produced by other means of DNA insertion (particle bombardment, calcium phosphate or liposome transfection). Therefore, the viral-derived particles in the supernatant of the transfected PA317 cells were used to trans-infect the PG13 packaging cell line. The resulting clones were selected using 700 ug/ml hygromycin in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin for 14 days. Clones were picked using cloning rings and grown as separate cell lines.</p>\n  These PG13 amy clones were tested for amylase production by native gel electrophoresis of \u03b1-amylase. The \u03b1-amylase samples in loading buffer (OJM tris- borate pH 8.5, 10% sucrose, lOmM magnesium chloride) were electrophoresed for 3- 4 hours at 250 volts, with cooling, on a 5.5% acrylamide gel containing OJM tris- borate pH 8.5. The electrophoresis buffer was OJM tris-borate pH 8.5. The gel was then placed with gentle shaking for 1 h at room temperature in a solution of 2% soluble starch, lOmM calcium chloride, 50mM tris-HCl pH 7.5. The gel was briefly rinsed in water, then placed in a dilute solution of iodine (I<sub>2</sub> : KI : water is about 1 : 2 : \n\n 16 2000) until the amylase signal shows as a clear band on the gel.</p>\n  All packaging cells produce filled retroviral particles which contain the desired gene and empty particles which do not carry the desired gene. To increase the number of filled retroviral particles, hygromycin-resistant PG13 amy clones producing high amounts of amylase were supertransfected with a second plasmid, pLN(A)amy, which also carried the amylase gene but which has neomycin as the clone selection agent. In this procedure, first pLN(A)amy was transfected into the PA317 cell line by the calcium phosphate procedure, and then the viral-derived particles in the supernatant of the transfected PA317 amy-containing cells were used to trans-infect a</p>\n  PG13/pLH(A)amy clone. The PG13/pLH(A) clone which was supertransfected was chosen on the basis of high amylase production. Superclones, containing both pLN(A)amy and pLH(A)amy sequences were obtained by selecting in the presence of 1000 ug/ml G418 and 700 ug/ml hygromycin as described above. The surviving clones were picked and grown up for further testing. Although a marker protein, amylase, was used in these experiments to optimize filling of particles, it is obvious that the same procedure can be done where another protein, such as a pharmaceutical protein, is used instead of the amylase.</p>\n  The superclones producing the highest levels of amylase were analyzed for particle production by the following method.
