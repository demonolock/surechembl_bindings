    " a fragment, or a variant thereof, is capable of interacting with the FGF receptor and/or Adenosine-Tri-Phosphate (ATP) and/or L1.</p>In the present context the \u201cfragment thereof\u201d is to be understood as being any part of the NCAM molecule capable of interacting with an FGF-receptor and/or ATP and/or L1 and through said binding modulate proliferation, and/or induce differentiation, and/or stimulate regeneration, neuronal plasticity and/or survival of cells. The \u201cvariant thereof\u201d is to be understood as being any peptide sequence capable of interacting with FGF-receptors and/or ATP and/or L1, and via said binding induce differentiation, modulate proliferation, stimulate regeneration, neuronal plasticity and survival of cells. Thus, fragment or variant may be defined as\ni) Fragments/variants comprising an amino acid sequence capable of being recognised by an antibody also capable of recognising the predetermined NCAM amino acid sequence, and/orii) Fragments/variants comprising an amino acid sequence capable of binding to a receptor moiety also capable of binding the predetermined NCAM amino acid sequence, and/oriii) Fragments/variants having at least a substantially similar binding affinity to at least one FGF receptor and/or ATP and/or L1 as said predetermined NCAM amino acid sequence.\n</p>In the present context the term \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d means a variant as defined above.</p>The binding affinity of the compound according to the invention preferably has a binding affinity (Kd value) to NCAM and/or the NCAM ligand in the range of 10<sup>\u22123 </sup>to 10<sup>\u221210 </sup>M, such as preferably in the range of 10<sup>\u22124 </sup>to 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M. According to the present invention the binding affinity is determined by one of the following assays of surface plasmon resonance analysis or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.</p>In the present context, a variant of the NCAM domains mentioned above is to be understood as being any compound interacting with any cell presenting a FGF receptor or an NCAM ligand, and/or L1 and through said interaction modulates proliferation, and/or induce differentiation, and/or stimulate regeneration, neuronal plasticity and/or survival of FGF receptor presenting cells, i.e. functional variants. Variants may be peptides, peptide derivatives, antibodies and non-peptide compounds such as small organic compounds, sugars and fats, as well as peptido-mimetics. In a preferred embodiment the variant is a peptide as discussed above.</p>In one embodiment variants may be understood to exhibit amino acid sequences gradually differing from the preferred predetermined sequence, as the number and scope of insertions, deletions and substitutions including conservative substitutions increase. This difference is measured as a reduction in homology between the predetermined sequence and the variant.</p>The peptides may be modified, for example by substitution of one or more of the amino acid residues.
