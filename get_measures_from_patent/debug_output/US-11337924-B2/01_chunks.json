    "ia ALL and AML cells.</p>Producing Pep-HPLNs:</p>Liposomal nanoparticles are synthesized via extrusion to give particles of narrow size distribution followed by active (pH gradient) loading with doxorubicin and final polymerization of the shell to produce HPLN/dox particles. We prepare peptide-terminated Peg lipids by incubating the thiol-containing peptide analogs with maleimide terminated Peg lipids (as demonstrated for the reduced monoclonal antibodies herein). These peptide-terminated Peg lipids are co-mixed with other methoxy-terminated Peg lipids to produce mixed micelles (Iden 2001). As was done with monoclonal antibody micelles, the peptide-terminated Peg lipid micelles are incubated with the HPLN/dox particles to insert the peptide lipids into the HPLN/dox particles, producing pep-HPLN/Dox.</p>Assaying Pep-HPLN/Dox for Tumor Targeting and Killing:</p>By using conventional diagnostic flow cytometry (FACS analysis) the peptide labeled HPLNs (pep-HPLN) are compared to the antibody labeled HPLNs for affinity binding to ALL cells and AML cells. Cells are exposed to the targeted HPLNs followed by a washing step to remove any unbound particles. FACS, utilizing the inherent fluorescence of the HPLN polymer, gives a good indication of the comparative efficacy of cell binding between the pep-HPLN compared to the anti-CD (-19, -117, -99 or -34)-HPLNs. After optimizing the per-particle level of targeting peptide, done by varying the HPLN/peptide-micelle ratio, both the in vitro binding assay and in vitro tumor killing study are undertaken to validate peptide-induced localization and uptake.</p>After the pep-HPLN is optimized to target CD-19, CD-117, CD-99 or CD-34 positive tumor cells, the in vivo tumorcidal activity assay in mice is performed. As before, NOG mice are injected with 6\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>luciferase transfected leukemia cells. The systemic distribution and cell killing by pep-HPLN/Dox are continuously assessed by eternal Xenogen camera imaging of the luciferase transfected leukemia cells. Follow-on studies after allowing established tumors to form, are subsequently conducted. In this way, the reduction in tumor burden by pep-HPLNs is analyzed for their therapeutic efficacy. This study leads to the successful identification of a synthetic peptide HPLN conjugate that can bind to leukemia cells at least as well as HPLNs targeted by the anti-CD-19, -99, -117 or -34 monoclonal antibodies, and provides a new formulation comprised of a drug-loaded, engineered peptide targeted HPLN (pep-HPLN/Dox) that functions in vivo with tumorcidal activity comparable to antibody targeted HPLN/Dox.</p>The tumor targeting of HPLNs by small, synthetic peptides may offer a powerful solution to avoiding the use of potentially immunogenic murine-derived antibodies in humans. In addition, we can turn toward more traditional methods for \u201chumanizing\u201d murine-derived monoclonal antibodies. Rational design approaches such as CDR grafting, \u201cresurfacing\u201d, \u201csuperhumanization"
