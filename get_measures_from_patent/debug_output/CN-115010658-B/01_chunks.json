    "ount of fluorescent product in the mixture was measured after passing through an enzyme-labeled instrument. The fluorescence intensities at excitation at 350-360nm and emission wavelengths of 450-460nm were then read on a TECAN microplate reader. IC (integrated circuit) <sub>50</sub> Values were calculated using a nonlinear regression method and normalized dose-response fitting was performed using Prism-GraphPad software, and all experiments were performed at least three times independently. Table 1 shows the results of the anti-histone deacetylase activity test of the compounds HP1-HP 6.</p><p id=\"p0090\" num=\"0085\">TABLE 1 results of anti-histone deacetylase Activity test of Compounds HP1-HP6</p><p id=\"p0091\" num=\"0086\"></p><p id=\"p0092\" num=\"0087\">Wherein the positive control and the control (SAHA and BMS-202) were compared with the samples HP1-6, respectively. The results of in vitro experiments in Table 1 show that the hydroxamic acid compounds (HP 1-6) containing 3- (2-pyridine) biphenyl have a strong inhibition effect on HDAC6, the activity of which is equivalent to that of SAHA, while BMS-202 has no inhibition effect on HDAC 6.</p><p id=\"p0093\" num=\"0088\">2. Test of Compounds for PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitory Activity</p><p id=\"p0094\" num=\"0089\">The in vivo antitumor activity test of the compounds in the test part adopts a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) method, which is a technology for detecting an object to be detected in a pure liquid phase system.PD-1/PD-L1 binding assay kit (Cat#64ICP01 PEG) was purchased from Cisbio, and Plate Format-96well (Cat#66 PL 96025) was purchased from Greiner. The specific test method is as follows:</p><p id=\"p0095\" num=\"0090\">the experimental procedure was as follows:</p><p id=\"p0096\" num=\"0091\">1) Dilution of the compound and preparation of the test solution:</p><p id=\"p0097\" num=\"0092\">(1) Dilution of compound mother liquor: in order to accurately measure the inhibition of the binding capacity of each compound to PD-1/PD-L1, we first need to dilute each compound to 20mmol/L of compound mother liquor. The amount of DMSO required to dilute each compound can be calculated according to formula c=n/v=m/M/V. After preparing the compound mother solution, the mother solution is diluted into diluted solutions of 10 mu mol/L,3.333 mu mol/L,1.111 mu mol/L,0.370 mu mol/L,0.123 mu mol/L,0.041 mu mol/L,0.013 mu mol/L and 0.004 mu mol/L by using a gradient dilution method in sequence, and the diluted solutions are uniformly mixed for standby.</p><p id=\"p0098\" num=\"0093\">(2) Dilution of PD-L1 protein mixture: 7mL of PD-L1 protein in the kit is taken, and 510mL of a diluent is added to dilute the protein, and the protein is uniformly mixed for standby.</p><p id=\"p0099\" num=\"0094\">(3) Dilution of PD-1 protein mixture: taking 5mL of PD-1 protein in the kit, adding 550mL of a dilutent diluent to dilute the protein, and uniformly mixing for later use.</p><p id=\"p0100\" num=\"0095\">(4) Preparing a mixed test solution: mix"
