Two or more combined compounds may be used together or sequentially.</p>Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compounds which exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred.</p>The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulation a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of compositions of the invention lies generally within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range of the compound or, when appropriate, of the polypeptide product of a target sequence (e.g., achieving a decreased concentration of the polypeptide) that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.</p>In addition to their administration individually or as a plurality, as discussed above, the dsRNAs of the invention can be administered in combination with other known agents effective in treatment of pathological processes mediated by JC virus expression. In any event, the administering physician can adjust the amount and timing of dsRNA administration on the basis of results observed using standard measures of efficacy known in the art or described herein.</p>Methods for Treating Diseases Caused by Expression of a Gene from the JC Virus</p>The invention relates in particular to the use of a dsRNA or a pharmaceutical composition prepared therefrom for the treatment or prevention of pathological conditions associated with JC Virus infection, e.g., PML. Owing to the inhibitory effect on JC virus expression, an dsRNA according to the invention or a pharmaceutical composition prepared therefrom can enhance the quality of life, particularly in a patient being treated with an anti-VLA4 antibody as part of treatment for MS.</p>The invention furthermore relates to the use of an dsRNA or a pharmaceutical composition thereof for treating PML in combination with other pharmaceutic",
    "rding to the manufacturer's protocol for Dual-Glo Luciferase assay and luminescence was measured in a Victor-Light 1420 Luminescence Counter (Perkin Elmer, Rodgau-Juigesheim, Germany). Values obtained with Renilla luciferase were normalized to the respective values obtained with Firefly luciferase in order to correct for transfection efficacy. Renilla/Firefly luciferase activities obtained after transfection with siRNAs directed against a JCV gene were normalized to Renilla/Firefly luciferase activities obtained after transfection of an unrelated control siRNA set to 100%. Tables 1a and b provides the results where the siRNAs, the sequences of which are given in Tables 1a and b, were tested at a single dose of 30 nM. The percentage inhibition\u00b1standard deviation, compared to the unrelated control siRNA, is indicated in the column \u2018Remaining luciferase activity (% of control)\u2019. A number of JCV siRNAs at 30 nM were effective at reducing levels of the targeted mRNA by more than 70% in Cos-7 cells (i.e. remaining luciferase activity was less than 30%).</p>Selected JCV siRNAs from the single dose screen were further characterized by dose response curves. Transfections of JCV siRNAs for generation of dose response curves were performed with the following siRNA concentrations according to the above protocol:\nfrom 33 nM in 3-fold dilutions down to 0.005 nM (for fragment L1)from 24 nM in 4-fold dilutions down to 0.001 nM (for fragment E and fragments LA23 1-700 and LA23 701-1438).\n</p>IC50 values were determined by parameterized curve fitting using the program XLfit (IDBS, Guildford, Great Britain). Table 2 provides the results from two independent experiments for 32 selected JCV siRNAs. The mean IC50 from these two independent experiments is shown. Several JCV siRNAs (AD-12622, AD-12677, AD-12709, AD-12710, AD-12722, AD-12724, AD-12728, AD-12763, AD-12767, AD-12768, AD-12769, AD-12771, AD-12774, AD-12775, AD-12777, AD-12781, AD-12784, AD-12795, AD-12813, AD-12821, AD-12823, AD-12824, AD-12825, AD-12827, AD-12829, AD-12842) were particularly potent in this experimental paradigm, and exhibited IC50 values between 70 \u03bcM and 1 nM.</p>TABLE 2IC50sMean IC50Duplex name[nM]AD-125992.37AD-126220.57AD-126663.7AD-126770.49AD-127090.19AD-127100.47AD-127122.33AD-127220.12AD-127240.26AD-127280.8AD-127611.2AD-127630.95AD-127670.09AD-127680.19AD-127690.35AD-127710.35AD-127740.13AD-127750.18AD-127770.17AD-1277812.65AD-127810.18AD-127840.44AD-127950.65AD-128130.2AD-128181.88AD-128210.07AD-128230.46AD-128240.25AD-128250.52AD-128270.15AD-128290.14AD-128420.44\nScreen of JCV siRNAs Against Live JC Virus in SVG-A Cells\n</p>Cells and Virus</p>SVG-A cells (human fetal glial cells transformed by SV40 T antigen) obtained from Walter Atwood at Brown University were cultured in Eagle's Minimum Essential Media (ATCC, Manassas, Va.) supplemented to contain 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Omega Scientific, Tarzana, Calif.), Penicillin 100 U/ml, Streptomycin 100 ug/ml (Invitrogen, Carlsbad Calif.) at 37\u00b0 C. in an atmosphere with 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>in a humidified incubator (Heraeus HERAcell, Thermo Electron Corporation, Ashville, N.C.).
