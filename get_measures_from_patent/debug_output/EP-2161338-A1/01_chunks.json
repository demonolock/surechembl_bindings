(1988) Non-isotopic Immunoassays Plenum Press, NY.</p>Immunoassays for measurement of these monocyte proteins can be performed by a variety of methods known to those skilled in the art. In brief, immunoassays to measure the protein can be competitive or noncompetitive binding assays. In competitive binding assays, the sample to be analyzed competes with a labeled analyte for specific binding sites on a capture agent bound to a solid surface. Preferably the capture agent is an antibody specifically reactive with the monocyte protein produced as described above. The concentration of labeled analyte bound to the capture agent is inversely proportional to the amount of free analyte present in the sample.</p>In a competitive binding immunoassay, the monocyte protein present in the sample competes with labeled protein for binding to a specific binding agent, for example, an antibody specifically reactive with the monocyte protein. The binding agent may be bound to a solid surface to effect separation of bound labeled protein from the unbound labeled protein. Alternately, the competitive binding assay may be conducted in liquid phase and any of a variety of techniques known in the art may be used to separate the bound labeled protein from the unbound labeled protein. Following separation, the amount of bound labeled protein is determined. The amount of protein present in the sample is inversely proportional to the amount of labeled protein binding.</p>Alternatively, a homogeneous immunoassay may be performed in which a separation step is not needed. In these immunoassays, the label on the protein is altered by the binding of the protein to its specific binding agent. This alteration in the labeled protein results in a decrease or increase in the signal emitted by label, so that measurement of the label at the end of the immunoassay allows for detection or quantitation of the protein.</p>These monocyte proteins may also be quantitatively determined by a variety of noncompetitive immunoassay methods. For example, a two-site, solid phase sandwich immunoassay may be used. In this type of assay, a binding agent for the protein, for example an antibody, is attached to a solid support. A second protein binding agent, which may also be an antibody, and which binds the protein at a different site, is labeled. After binding at both sites on the protein has occurred, the unbound labeled binding agent is removed and the amount of labeled binding agent bound to the solid phase is measured. The amount of labeled binding agent bound is directly proportional to the amount of",
    "onocyte protein) are contacted and incubated with an antibody having known binding affinity to the antigen, such as <sup>125</sup>I-antibody, and a test sample whose binding affinity to the binding composition is being measured. The bound and free labeled binding compositions are then separated to assess the degree of protein binding. The amount of test compound bound is inversely proportional to the amount of labeled antibody binding to the known source. Many techniques can be used to separate bound from free reagent to assess the degree of binding. This separation step could typically involve a procedure such as adhesion to filters followed by washing, adhesion to plastic followed by washing, or centrifugation of the cell membranes. Viable cells could also be used to screen for the effects of drugs on these monocyte protein mediated functions, e.g., antigen presentation or helper function.</p>Another method utilizes membranes from transformed eukaryotic or prokaryotic host cells as the source of a monocyte protein. These cells are stably transformed with DNA vectors directing the expression of the appropriate protein, e.g., an engineered membrane bound form. Essentially, the membranes would be prepared from the cells and used in binding assays such as the competitive assay set forth above.</p>Still another approach is to use solubilized, unpurified or solubilized, purified monocyte protein from transformed eukaryotic or prokaryotic host cells. This allows for a \"molecular\" binding assay with the advantages of increased specificity, the ability to automate, and high drug test throughput.</p>Another technique for drug screening involves an approach which provides high throughput screening for compounds having suitable binding affinity to the respective monocyte protein and is described in detail in Geysen, European Patent Application 84/03564, published on September 13, 1984</patcit>. First, large numbers of different small peptide test compounds are synthesized on a solid substrate, e.g., plastic pins or some other appropriate surface, see Fodor, et al., supra. Then all the pins are reacted with solubilized, unpurified or solubilized, purified monocyte protein, and washed. The next step involves detecting bound reagent, e.g., antibody.</p>One means for determining which sites interact with specific other proteins is a physical structure determination, e.g., x-ray crystallography or 2 dimensional NMR techniques. These will provide guidance as to which amino acid residues form molecular contact regions. For a detailed description of protein structural determination, see, e.g., Blundell and Johnson (1976) Protein Crystallography Academic Press, NY.</p>X.

Typically the kit will have a compartment containing either a defined "
