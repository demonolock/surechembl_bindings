Group-X sPLA2 IC50 value exhibited variable increase according to the experiment, ranging from 25 -fold to 150-fold its value in serum.\n2. GIIF sPLA2 IC50 value was increased by approximately 17.5-fold.\n3. Results are shown in Figure 2, where all three classes of lipoproteins are inhibitory when oxidized, with respective IC50 values of 85\u03bcg PL/mL (CM/VLDL), 200\u03bcg PL/mL (LDL), and 300\u03bcg /PL/mL (HDL).\n4. Each SPLA2 was used at approximately 10 x IC50.\n5. IC50 values of both enzymes were found to increase in Albumax II\u00ae.\n\nNote that some of these sentences may not have a specific unit (e.g., \"nM\", \"uM\", \"%\") explicitly mentioned, but they do contain a numeric value and a metric (e.g., \"\u03bcg PL/mL\"). If you would like me to be more strict with the unit requirement, I can re-extract the sentences. Let me know!"}
