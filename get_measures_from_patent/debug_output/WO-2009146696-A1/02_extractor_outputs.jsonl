{"raw_mentions": "It has been found that preincubation of the microsomal fraction of interleukin-1\u03b2-stimulated A549 cells with specific indole-3-carboxylic acid esters results in potent inhibition of mPGES-1 activity, for example, by adding 10 \u03bcM compound 135a to PGE <sub>2</sub> synthesis from PGH <sub>2</sub> to about 90% inhibits, the IC <sub>50</sub> -WeIi is about 1 uM (Fig. 3).\nAlso in the cellular system, indole-3-carboxylic acid esters appear as potent inhibitors of the PGE <sub>2</sub> synthesis and show IC 50 values of about 5 \u03bcM for compounds 89a and 135a (FIG. 4).\nIt can be seen (Figure 5) that compounds 89a, 13Od, 135a, and 141d result in potent and concentration-dependent inhibition of 5-LO activity, with IC <sub>50</sub> values of 0.25, 0.07, 0.09, and 0.12 \u03bcM."}
