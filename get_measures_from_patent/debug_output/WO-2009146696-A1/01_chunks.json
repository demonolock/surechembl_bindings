[
    "5 nm).</p>It has been found that preincubation of the microsomal fraction of interleukin-1\u03b2-stimulated A549 cells with specific indole-3-carboxylic acid esters results in potent inhibition of mPGES-1 activity, for example, by adding 10 \u03bcM compound 135a to PGE <sub>2</sub> synthesis from PGH <sub>2</sub> to about 90% inhibits, the IC <sub>50</sub> -WeIi is about 1 uM (Fig. 3).</p>2. Determination of the PGE? Sness in Intact A549 Cells:</p>A549 cells were incubated with interleukin-1\u03b2 (1 ng / ml) for 72 hours. After harvesting and cell count determination, the cells (2 \u00d7 10 <sup>6</sup> ) were resuspended in CaCl <sub>2</sub> -containing PBS buffer. After preincubation with the test substances for 10 min at 37 <sup>0</sup> C, the PGE <sub>2</sub> formation is induced by the addition of A23187 (2.5 uM), AA (1 uM) and <sup>[3</sup> H] AA (18.4 kBq). The reaction is stopped after 15 min at 37 \u00b0 C by cooling to 4 \u00b0 C. After centrifugation (800\u03c7g, 5 min, 4 \u00b0C) the supernatant is acidified by citric acid (pH 3) and with the internal standard 11\u03b2-PGE <sub>2</sub>  Mistake. The radiolabelled PGE <sub>2</sub> is separated by solid phase extraction (RP-18 columns and acetonitrile as eluent) and RP-HPLC (RP-18, UV detection of the standard at 195 nm) and quantified by liquid scintillation counting (LKB Wallac 1209 Rackbeta Liquid Scintillation Counter). ,</p>Also in the cellular system, indole-3-carboxylic acid esters appear as potent inhibitors of the PGE <sub>2</sub> synthesis and show IC 50 values of about 5 \u03bcM for compounds 89a and 135a (FIG. 4).</p>b) Influence of arylfgiindole-3-carboxylic acid ester on the activity of 5-LO</p>1. Determination of the activity of 5-LO in cell-free systems:</p>To obtain recombinant 5-LO, E. coli (strain MV1190) are transformed with the plasmid pT3-5LO, harvested after 5-LO expression and lysed [9]. Lysate of E. coli <sup>\u03c7</sup> a 100,000 g centrifugation are subjected. Aliquots of the 100-OOO <sup>\u03c7</sup> g supernatant is then pre-incubated with the inhibitors on ice for 5 min and preheated in a water bath (37 \u00b0 C) for 30 sec. To induce 5-LO product formation, 20 \u03bcM arachidonic acid and 1 mM Ca <sup>2+ are</sup> added. After 10 min at 37 \u00b0 C., the incubation with methanol is stopped, the formed 5-LO metabolites (trans-LTB <sub>4</sub> , epi-trans-LTB <sub>4</sub> , 5-H (P) ETE) are isolated by solid-phase extraction and then purified by means of automated RP- HPLC system qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed [10].</p>It can be seen (Figure 5) that compounds 89a, 13Od, 135a, and 141d result in potent and concentration-dependent inhibition of 5-LO activity, with IC <sub>50</sub> values of 0.25, 0.07, 0.09, and 0.12 \u03bcM.</p>2. Determination of the activity of 5-LO in intact PMNL:</p>PMNL are isolated from fresh human leukocyte concentrates according to a standard protocol [11], resuspended in PBS in the presence of 1 mM CaCb, and preincubated with inhibitors accordingly. After stimulus addition (2.5 \u03bcM ionophore plus 20 ",
    " are dissolved in 5 ml of CH <sub>2</sub> Cl <sub>2</sub> . After the addition of 506.0 mg (5.0 mmol) of triethylamine under ice-cooling 1, 76 g (6.25 mmol) of trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride (TfO <sub>2)</sub> was added and the reaction mixture stirred for 4 h at 0 <sup>0</sup> C. The solvent is then distilled off in vacuo and the product isolated by flash chromatography on silica gel (cyclohexane / ethyl acetate 4: 1 v / v).
