    "issolved at 40\u00b0 C. in 2-propanol (3.92 g, 5 mL). The clear solution was cooled to RT and water (3.00 g, 3 mL) was added. The solution was seeded (crude, dried product did slowly crystallize upon standing providing the first seed crystals) and the crystallization started slowly. After 30 min, water (7.00 g, 7 mL) was added dropwise over 10 min. The white suspension was stirred 1 h at RT and filtered. The filter cake was washed with water and dried at 40\u00b0 C./5 mbar to give 1 g of product as white crystals.</p>Alternatively, tert-butyl N-[4-chloro-2-[(E)-methyliminomethyl]phenyl]carbamate (2 g, 7.29 mmol, Eq.: 1) was suspended in methanol (20 mL). Pt/C 5% (185 mg) was added, the mixture was pressurized with hydrogen (5 bar) and stirred at RT. After completion of the reaction, the catalyst was filtered and the solution was concentrated under reduced pressure to give 1.85 g of crude tert-butyl N-[4-chloro-2-(methylaminomethyl)-phenyl]carbamate. The title compound can be crystallized as described above.</p>tert-Butyl N-[4-chloro-2-[[cyanomethyl(methyl)amino]methyl]phenyl]carbamate VII<img id=\"EMI-C00032\" path=\"US20160280712A1-20160929-C00032.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/354295482/US/20160929/A1/020160/28/07/12/US20160280712A1-20160929-C00032.TIF\"/></p>tert-Butyl N-[4-chloro-2-(methylaminomethyl)phenyl]carbamate (49.9 g, 184 mmol, Eq: 1.00) was dissolved in AcOEt (226 g, 250 mL). Sodium hydrogen carbonate (16.6 g, 198 mmol, Eq: 1.07) and potassium iodide (KI) (6 g, 36.0 mmol, Eq: 0.196) were added in one portion. 2-chloroacetonitrile (15.4 g, 13.0 mL, 200 mmol, Eq: 1.09) was added in one portion and the reaction mixture was heated at reflux for 15 h (&lt;2% starting material). The reaction mixture was cooled to RT. 10% Aqueous NaCl (262 g, 250 mL) was added. The organic phase was separated and washed with half saturated aqueous NaHCO<sub>3 </sub>(261 g, 250 mL). The organic phase was stirred overnight together with 10% aqueous sodium thiosulfate (291 g, 250 mL, 184 mmol, Eq: 1.00) and tetrabutylamonium chloride (1 g, 3.6 mmol, Eq: 0.02). The organic phase was separated and washed with 10% aqueous NaCl (262 g, 250 mL). The organic phase was concentrated to circa half the volume and was filtered. The volume was adjusted to circa 200 mL with EtOH and the solution was solvent exchanged to EtOH at constant volume. The solution was cooled to circa 28-30\u00b0 C. and was seeded. After 30 min, the suspension was cooled to RT and water (40 mL) was added dropwise. The suspension was stirred overnight at RT and 2 h at 0-5\u00b0 C. The suspension was filtered. The filter cake was washed with EtOH/water 1:1 (100 mL) and was dried at 60\u00b0 C./5 mbar to give 46.8 g of title compound as white crystals.</p>tert-Butyl N-[4-chloro-2-[[cyanomethyl(methyl)amino]methyl]phenyl]carbamate VI<img id=\"EMI-C00033\" path=\"US20160280712A1-20160929-C00033.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/354295476/US/20160929/A1/020160/28/07/12/US20160280712A1-201"
