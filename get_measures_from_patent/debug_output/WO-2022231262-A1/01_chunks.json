    " increase in gout patients. If you look at the incidence of gout, the level is about 1.4/1000, but this also shows different results depending on the level of uric acid. In other words, the incidence of gout was 0.5% in the group of patients with blood uric acid levels of 7.0 mg/dl or higher, whereas the incidence of gout was 5.5% in the group of patients with uric acid levels above 9.0 mg/dl (G. Nuki, Medicine, 2006, 34, 417-423). Considering the above incidence rate, it can be seen that blood uric acid concentration is an important factor inducing gout. In addition, dietary habits, alcohol, lipids, and obesity can also act as important factors inducing gout. Recently, many researchers have been actively researching the correlation between uric acid and heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, kidney disease and cardiovascular disease, and the importance of uric acid management is increasing (D. I. Feig et al. ., N. Eng. J. Med, 2008, 23, 1811-1821). In addition, it is known that xanthine oxidase inhibitor, allopurinol, is effective for ulcerative colitis (Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000, 14, 1159-1162; WO 2007/043457).</p>Until febuxostat was approved as a gout treatment in the United States in 2009 (Brain Tomlinson, Current opin. invest. drugs, 2005, 6, 1168~1178), the drug used as a gout treatment for the past 40 years was allopurinol. This was unique. Allopurinol is known as a non-specific inhibitor of various enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine metabolism, and has a Ki 700 nM for xanthine oxidase (Y. Takano et al., Life Sciences, 2005, 76, 1835-1847). . It is known that allopurinol is oxidized by xanthine oxidase and converted to oxypurinol, and this metabolite acts as a very strong inhibitor of xanthine oxidase.</p>However, it is known that allopurinol has side effects from the gastrointestinal tract and skin rash, and its adherence to long-term use is poor. In particular, among patients taking allopurinol, a small but unpredictable fatal side effect of Stevens-Johnson syndrome has been reported (Felix Arellano et al, Ann. Pharm., 1993, 27, 337-43). This side effect is known to be a serious side effect that causes cell necrosis in the skin and mucous membranes of the mouth and leads to death in about 25% of cases if not properly dealt with.</p>Accordingly, various studies have been conducted to develop new xanthine oxidase inhibitors, and Korean Patent Publication No. 10-2011-0037883 discloses a novel compound of Formula 1 effective as a xanthine oxidase inhibitor:</p>[Formula 1]</p><img id=\"i04\" path=\"PCTKR2022005926-appb-img-000004.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/997411592/WO/20221103/A1/002022/23/12/62/PCTKR2022005926-appb-img-000004.tif\"/></p>In Formula 1,</p>A is selected from the following substituents A-i, A-ii, A-iii, A-iv, A-v, A-vi, A-vii and A-viii;</p><img id=\"i05\" path=\"PCTKR2022005926-appb-img-000005.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/997411593/WO/20221103/A1/002022/23/12/62/PCT"
