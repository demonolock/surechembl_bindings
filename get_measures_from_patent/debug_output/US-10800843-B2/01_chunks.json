Examples of such binding proteins include antibodies, such as a human antibody, a humanized antibody; a chimeric antibody; a recombinant antibody; a single chain antibody; a diabody; a triabody; a tetrabody; a Fab fragment; a F(ab\u2032) 2 fragment; an IgD antibody; an IgE antibody; an IgM antibody; an IgG1 antibody; an IgG2 antibody; an IgG3 antibody; or an IgG4 antibody, and fragments thereof. The binding protein can comprise, for example, an alternative protein scaffold or artificial scaffold with grafted CDRs or CDR derivatives. Such scaffolds include, but are not limited to, antibody-derived scaffolds comprising mutations introduced to, for example, stabilize the three-dimensional structure of the binding protein as well as wholly synthetic scaffolds comprising, for example, a biocompatible polymer. See, e.g., Korndorfer et al., 2003, Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics, 53(1):121-129 (2003); Roque et al., Biotechnol. Prog. 20:639-654 (2004). In addition, peptide antibody mimetics (\u201cPAMs\u201d) can be used, as well as scaffolds based on antibody mimetics utilizing fibronectin components as a scaffold. In the context of the present disclosure, a binding protein is said to specifically bind or selectively bind to beta klotho, for example, when the dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) is \u226410<sup>\u22128 </sup>M. The binding protein (e.g., antibody) may specifically bind beta klotho with high affinity when the K<sub>D </sub>is \u226410<sup>\u22129 </sup>M or K<sub>D </sub>is \u226410<sup>\u221210 </sup>M. In some embodiments, the binding proteins (e.g., antibodies) may bind to beta klotho or a complex comprising FGFR1c and beta klotho, including with a K<sub>D </sub>of between about 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>M and about 10<sup>\u221212 </sup>M and in other embodiments, the binding proteins (e.g., antibodies) may bind with a K<sub>D </sub>of 1-2\u00d710<sup>\u22129 </sup>M.</p>The term \u201cantibody\u201d and \u201cimmunoglobulin\u201d or \u201cIg\u201d are used interchangeably herein, and is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers, for example, individual anti-beta klotho monoclonal antibodies (including agonist, antagonist, neutralizing antibodies, full length or intact monoclonal antibodies), anti-beta klotho antibody compositions with polyepitopic or monoepitopic specificity, polyclonal or monovalent antibodies, multivalent antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity), formed from at least two intact antibodies, single chain anti-beta klotho antibodies, and fragments of anti-beta klotho antibodies, as described below. An antibody can be human, humanized, chimeric and/or affinity matured as well as an antibody from other species, for example mouse, rabbit etc. The term \u201cantibody\u201d is intended to include a pol",
    "such that the antibody is useful as a therapeutic agent in targeting a cell or tissue expressing the antigen, and does not significantly cross-react with other proteins. In such embodiments, the extent of binding of the antibody to a \u201cnon-target\u201d protein will be less than about 10% of the binding of the antibody to its particular target protein, for example, as determined by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis or radioimmunoprecipitation (RIA). With regard to the binding of an antibody to a target molecule, the term \u201cspecific binding\u201d or \u201cspecifically binds to\u201d or is \u201cspecific for\u201d a particular polypeptide or an epitope on a particular polypeptide target means binding that is measurably different from a non-specific interaction. Specific binding can be measured, for example, by determining binding of a molecule compared to binding of a control molecule, which generally is a molecule of similar structure that does not have binding activity. For example, specific binding can be determined by competition with a control molecule that is similar to the target, for example, an excess of non-labeled target. In this case, specific binding is indicated if the binding of the labeled target to a probe is competitively inhibited by excess unlabeled target. The term \u201cspecific binding\u201d or \u201cspecifically binds to\u201d or is \u201cspecific for\u201d a particular polypeptide or an epitope on a particular polypeptide target as used herein can be exhibited, for example, by a molecule having a Kd for the target of at least about 10<sup>\u22124</sup>M, alternatively at least about 10<sup>\u22125 </sup>M, alternatively at least about 10<sup>\u22126 </sup>M, alternatively at least about 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, alternatively at least about 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, alternatively at least about 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>M, alternatively at least about 10<sup>\u221219 </sup>M, alternatively at least about 10<sup>\u221211 </sup>M, alternatively at least about 10<sup>\u221212 </sup>M, or greater. In one embodiment, the term \u201cspecific binding\u201d refers to binding where a molecule binds to a particular polypeptide or epitope on a particular polypeptide without substantially binding to any other polypeptide or polypeptide epitope. In certain embodiments, an antibody that binds to beta klotho has a dissociation constant (Kd) of less than or equal to 10 nM, 5 nM, 4 nM, 3 nM, 2 nM, 1 nM, 0.9 nM, 0.8 nM, 0.7 nM, 0.6 nM, 0.5 nM, 0.4 nM, 0.3 nM, 0.2 nM, or 0.1 nM. The lower the K<sub>D</sub>, the higher the affinity of the anti-beta klotho antibody. In certain embodiments, anti-beta klotho antibody binds to an epitope of beta klotho that is conserved among beta klotho from different species (e.g., between human and cyno beta klotho).</p>The term \u201ccompete\u201d when used in the context of anti-beta klotho antibodies (e.g., agonistic antibodies and binding proteins that bind to (i) beta klotho; or (ii) a complex comprising beta klotho and one of FGFR1c, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and FGFR4) that bind to or compete for the same epitope or binding site on a target means competition between as determined by an assay in which the antibody (or binding fragment) thereof under study prevents or inhibits the specific binding of a reference molecule (e.g., a reference ligand, or reference antigen binding protein, such as a reference antibody) to a common antigen (e.g., beta klotho or a fragment thereof). Numerous types of competitive binding assays can be used to determine if a test antibody competes with a reference antibody for binding to beta klotho (e.g., human beta klotho). Examples of assays that can be employed include solid phase direct or indirect radioimmunoassay (RIA), solid phase direct or indirect enzyme immunoassay (EIA), sandwich competition assay (see, e.g., Stahli et al., (1983) Methods in Enzymology 9:242-",
    "Antibodies identified by competition assay (competing antibodies) include antibodies binding to the same epitope as the reference antibody and/or antibodies binding to an adjacent epitope sufficiently proximal to the epitope bound by the reference for antibodies steric hindrance to occur. Additional details regarding methods for determining competitive binding and/or binding to the same epitope are described herein. Usually, when a competing antibodies protein is present in excess, it will inhibit specific binding of a reference antibodies to a common antigen by at least 23%, for example 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70% or 75%. In some instance, binding is inhibited by at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96% or 97%, 98%, 99% or more.</p>The term \u201canti-beta klotho antibody\u201d or \u201can antibody that binds to beta klotho\u201d includes an antibody that is capable of binding beta klotho with sufficient affinity such that the antibody is useful as a diagnostic and/or therapeutic agent in targeting beta klotho. Preferably, the extent of binding of an anti-beta klotho antibody to an unrelated, non-beta klotho protein is less than about 10% of the binding of the antibody to beta klotho as measured, for example, by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis or an immunoassay such as a radioimmunoassay (RIA). An antibody that \u201cspecifically binds to\u201d or is \u201cspecific for\u201d beta klotho is Illustrated above. In certain embodiments, an antibody that binds to beta klotho, as described herein has a dissociation constant (Kd) of less than or equal to 10 nM, 9 nM, 8 nM, 7 nM, 6 nM, 5 nM, 4 nM, 0.9 nM, 0.8 nM, 0.7 nM, 0.6 nM, 0.5 nM, 0.4 nM, 0.3 nM, 0.2 nM, or 0.1 nM, and/or is greater than or equal to 0.1 nM. In certain embodiments, anti-beta klotho antibody binds to an epitope of beta klotho that is conserved among beta klotho from different species (e.g., between human and cyno beta klotho).</p>An \u201cisolated\u201d antibody is substantially free of cellular material or other contaminating proteins from the cell or tissue source and/or other contaminant components from which the antibody is derived, or substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. The language \u201csubstantially free of cellular material\u201d includes preparations of an antibody in which the antibody is separated from cellular components of the cells from which it is isolated or recombinantly produced. Thus, an antibody that is substantially free of cellular material includes preparations of antibody having less than about 30%, 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%, 5%, or 1% (by dry weight) of heterologous protein (also referred to herein as a \u201ccontaminating protein\u201d). In certain embodiments, when the antibody is recombinantly produced, it is substantially free of culture medium, e.g., culture medium represents less than about 20%, 15%, 10%, 5%, or 1% of the volume of the protein preparation.

There are two distinct types, referred to as kappa (\u03ba) of lambda (\u03bb) based on the amino acid sequence of the constant domains. Light chain amino acid sequences are well known in the art. A light chain can be a human light chain.</p>The term \u201chost\u201d as used herein refers to an animal, such as a mammal (e.g., a human).</p>The term \u201chost cell\u201d as used herein refers to a particular subject cell that may be transfected with a nucleic acid molecule and the progeny or potential progeny of such a cell. Progeny of such a cell may not be identical to the parent cell transfected with the nucleic acid molecule due to mutations or environmental influences that may occur in succeeding generations or integration of the nucleic acid molecule into the host cell genome.</p>The term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, e.g., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts, and each monoclonal antibody will typically recognize a single epitope on the antigen. In specific embodiments, a \u201cmonoclonal antibody,\u201d as used herein, is an antibody produced by a single hybridoma or other cell, wherein the antibody binds to only a beta klotho epitope as determined, for example, by ELISA or other antigen-binding or competitive binding assay known in the art. The term \u201cmonoclonal\u201d is not limited to any particular method for making the antibody. For example, the monoclonal antibodies useful in the present disclosure may be prepared by the hybridoma methodology first described by Kohler et al., Nature, 256:495 (1975), or may be made using recombinant DNA methods in bacterial, eukaryotic animal or plant cells (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). The \u201cmonoclonal antibodies\u201d may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al., Nature, 352:624-628 (1991) and Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222:581-597 (1991), for example. Other methods for the preparation of clonal cell lines and of monoclonal antibodies expressed thereby are well known in the art (see, for example, Chapter 11 in: Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, (2002) 5th Ed., Ausubel et al., eds., John Wiley and Sons, New York). Exemplary methods of producing monoclonal antibodies are provided in the Examples herein.</p>The term \u201cnative\u201d when used in connection with biological materials such as nucleic acid molecules, polypeptides, host cells, and the like, refers to those which are found in nature and not manipulated, modified, and/or changed (e.g., isolated, purified, selected) by a human being.</p>The antibodies provided herein can include \u201cchimeric\u201d antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a ",
    "ell signaling or activities via an intercellular cell signaling pathway and wherein the antibody induces a similar cell signaling or activation.</p>An \u201cagonist\u201d of beta klotho refers to a molecule that is capable of activating or otherwise increasing one or more of the biological activities of beta klotho, such as in a cell expressing beta klotho and a FGF receptor. In some embodiments, an agonist of beta klotho (e.g., an agonistic antibody as described herein) may, for example, act by activating or otherwise increasing the activation and/or cell signaling pathways of a cell expressing a beta klotho protein and a FGF receptor, thereby increasing a beta klotho-mediated biological activity of the cell relative to the beta klotho-mediated biological activity in the absence of agonist. In some embodiments the antibodies provided herein are agonistic anti-beta klotho antibodies, including antibodies that induce FGF19-like signaling and/or FGF21-like signaling.</p>\u201cBinding affinity\u201d generally refers to the strength of the sum total of noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., a binding protein such as an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g., an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, \u201cbinding affinity\u201d refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1:1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., antibody and antigen). The affinity of a binding molecule X for its binding partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>). Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art, including those described herein. Low-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to dissociate readily, whereas high-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain bound longer. A variety of methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art, any of which can be used for purposes of the present disclosure. Specific illustrative embodiments include the following. In one embodiment, the \u201cK<sub>D</sub>\u201d or \u201cK<sub>D </sub>value\u201d may be measured by assays known in the art, for example by a binding assay. The K<sub>D </sub>may be measured in a radiolabeled antigen binding assay (RIA), for example, performed with the Fab version of an antibody of interest and its antigen (Chen, et al., (1999) J. Mol Biol 293:865-881). The K<sub>D </sub>or K<sub>D </sub>value may also be measured by using surface plasmon resonance assays by Biacore, using, for example, a BIAcore\u2122-2000 or a BIAcore\u2122-3000 BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.), or by biolayer interferometry using, for example, the OctetQK384 system (ForteBio, Menlo Park, Calif.). An \u201con-rate\u201d or \u201crate of association\u201d or \u201cassociation rate\u201d or \u201ckon\u201d may can also be determined with the same surface plasmon resonance or biolayer interferometry techniques described above using, for example, a BIAcore\u2122-2000 or a BIAcore\u2122-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.), or the OctetQK384 sytem (ForteBio, Menlo Park, Calif.).</p>The phrase \u201csubstantially similar\u201d or \u201csubstantially the same\u201d denotes a sufficiently high degree of similarity between two numeric values (e.g., one associated with an antibody of the present disclosure and the other associated with a reference antibody) such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of little or no biological and/or statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by the values (e.g., K<sub>D </sub>values). For example, the difference between the two values may be less than about 50%, less than about 40%, less than about 30%, less than about 20%, less than about 10%, less than about 5%, ",
    " (also referred to as fusion partner). For example, if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the selective culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT medium), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.</p>Preferred fusion partner myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level production of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a selective medium that selects against the unfused parental cells. Preferred myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines, such as SP-2 and derivatives, for example, X63-Ag8-653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va., USA and those derived from MOPC-21 and MPC-11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif. USA. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor, J., Immunol., 133:3001 (1984); and Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987)).</p>Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. The binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis described in Munson et al., Anal. Biochem., 107:220 (1980).</p>Once hybridoma cells that produce antibodies of the desired specificity, affinity, and/or activity are identified, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, pp. 59-103 (Academic Press, 1986)). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, D-MEM or RPMI-1640 medium. In addition, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal, for example, by i.p. injection of the cells into mice.</p>The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium, ascites fluid, or serum by conventional antibody purification procedures such as, for example, affinity chromatography (e.g., using protein A or protein G-Sepharose) or ion-exchange chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, etc.</p>DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may ",

From these assays, approximately of 250 antibodies were identified as binders to human beta klotho. These antibodies were purified and subsequently tested for their binding affinity to human beta klotho and cyno beta klotho by Biacore and for their functional activity by reporter assays as described in Example 3.</p>In additional Biacore-based binding/screening assays, the binding affinity of antibodies to human and cyno beta klotho were measured. For example, antibodies were rank ordered based on their binding affinity to human beta klotho and cyno beta klotho by low resolution K<sub>D </sub>measurement by Biacore. Briefly, anti-mouse Fc antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) was immobilized on all four flow cells of a CM5 chip using amine coupling reagents (GE Healthcare LifeSciences, Piscataway, N.J.). Purified antibodies were captured (\u02dc100 RUs) on flow cells 2, 3 and 4 using flow cell 1 as a reference. This was followed by injection of human or cyno beta klotho (25 nM in PBS-P buffer) at a flow rate of 70 \u03bcL/min and monitoring the binding kinetics at 25\u00b0 C.</p>Binding affinity measurements were also made in additional Biacore based assays. For example, equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) measurements were carried out with purified antibodies to evaluate their binding to human beta klotho and cyno beta klotho. As mentioned above, anti-mouse Fc antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) was immobilized on all four flow cells of a CM5 chip using amine coupling reagents (GE Healthcare LifeSciences, Piscataway, N.J.). Purified antibodies were captured (\u02dc100 RUs) on flow cells 2, 3 and 4 using flow cell 1 as a reference. This was followed by injection of different concentrations of human or cyno beta klotho (1.56 nM to 25 nM, two-fold dilutions in PBS-P buffer) at a flow rate of 70 \u03bcL/min and the binding kinetics were evaluated at 25\u00b0 C.</p>Representative results are reported as K<sub>D </sub>(nM) values as shown in Table 4 below.</p>TABLE 4Affinity K<sub>D </sub>(nM)HuKLBCyno KLB3I130.41.9IN181.44.54A20.923.22J214.812.2</p>Example 3: Screening and Selection of Antibodies to Beta KlothoAntibodies that were selected for binding to beta klotho, for example, such as described in Example 2, were evaluated in competition binding assays and epitope binning experiments.</p>For example, for competition binding assays by FACS analysis, antibody standards were prepared that were conjugated to a fluorochrome using either A488 or A647 antibody labeling kit (Invitrogen) following manufacturer's instructions.

In these assays, activation of recombinantly expressed FGFR1c/beta klotho receptor complex in the cells induces intracellular signaling transduction, which leads to ERK and then Elk1 phosphorylation. Once Gal4-Elk1 is phosphorylated, Gal4-Elk1 binds to the 5\u00d7UAS promoter region and turns on luciferase reporter gene transcription. The activity of luciferase is then measured in luciferase enzymatic assays.</p>For these experiments, the above mentioned four plasmids (e.g., 2 reporter plasmids, beta klotho, R1c) were transfected into newly harvested cells in suspension using FuGene6 or Fugene HD transfection reagent (Promega). Cell density and transfection reagent amount were optimized for each cell type and each Fugene batch. Beta klotho and FGFR1c DNA ratio in transfection was optimized for each cell line and varied between 6:1 to 27:1. Transfected cells were seeded into 96-well (30,000 cells/100 \u03bcL/well), or 384-well plate (7500 cells/25 \u03bcL/well) in normal growth medium. After overnight incubation at 37\u00b0 C., a variety of antibodies to beta klotho were added, including a control antibody (e.g., a known anti-beta klotho antibody). After 6 hrs of 37\u00b0 C. incubation with the antibodies, an equal volume of Bright-Glo reagent (Promega) was added and luminescence signal was read using Enspire reader (Perkin Elmer).</p>Representative results using human beta klotho and cyno beta klotho, transfected into HEK 293 and HEK 293 T cells, are reported as EC50 values as shown in Table 6 and Table 7, respectively, below.</p>TABLE 6Experiment - AExperiment - BHEK293 huKLB/R1cHEK293 huKLB/R1creporter assay EC50reporter assay EC50mAb(pM)(pM)Control27.9377.63I13332.81985</p>TABLE 7HEK293 cynoKLB/R1creporter assay EC50mAb(pM)Control178.43I13437.8</p>Example 5: Additional Functional AssaysAntibodies to beta klotho generated, for example, as described in Example 1, were tested for their functional activity in a cell-based assay, such as an adipocyte assay, which measures endogenous FGFR1c/beta klotho signaling.

Adipocytes are considered physiologically relevant for demonstrating the functional activity of receptor ligands or agonist antibodies which mimic the function of ligands (e.g., signaling of the receptor by the ligands).</p>For example, frozen human preadipocytes (Lonza Cat # PT-5005) were thawed on day 1, differentiated on day 3 and maintained in differentiation medium for about two weeks before the experiment (e.g., then starved on day 17, and assayed on day 18). The seeding medium was 1:1 DMEM/F12K+10% FBS. Seeding cell density was 25,000 cells/100 \u03bcL/well in 96-well plate. On day 3, medium was replaced with human adipocytes differentiation medium (Cell Applications Inc). From then on, fresh differentiation medium was added onto cells every 2-3 days. On day 17 (the day before the assay), the cells were rinsed two times"
