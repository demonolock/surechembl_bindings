    " example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,811. C16:1n7-palmitoleate (or its derivatives, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, or combinations thereof) can also be formulated to enhance intracellular delivery.</p>Dosage, toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of C16:1n7-palmitoleate (or its derivatives, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, or combinations thereof) can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. In some embodiments, C16:1n7-palmitoleate, its derivatives, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, or combinations thereof, exhibit high therapeutic indices.</p>The dosage of such compounds lies within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For C16:1n7-palmitoleate (or its derivatives, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, or combinations thereof) used in the methods, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to determine useful doses in humans accurately. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.</p>In some embodiments, an effective amount of C16:1n7-palmitoleate, its derivatives, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, or combinations thereof, ranges between about 0.000001 mg per kilogram body weight per day to about 10,000 mg per kilogram body weight per day. In some embodiments, the dosage ranges are between about 0.0001 mg per kilogram body weight per day to about 100 mg per kilogram body weight per day. By way of example, but not by way of limitation, in some embodiments, dosages are between about 1 to 10, between about 2 to 8, or between about 4-6 mg/kg body weight every day, every two days or every three days. In some embodiments, dosages are between about 1 to 10, between about 2 to 8, or between about 4-6 mg/kg body weight every week, every two weeks or every three weeks.</p>In some embodiments, a single dosage of C16:1n7-palmitoleate, its derivatives, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, or combinations thereof, ranges between about 0.001-10,000, between about 0.01-7,500, between about 0.1-5,000, between about 1.0-2,500, between about 10-1,000, between about 50-750, between about 100-500, or between about 150-250 micrograms per kg body weight.
