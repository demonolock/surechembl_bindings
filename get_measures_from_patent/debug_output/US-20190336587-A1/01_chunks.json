Covalent attachment of the PEG to the drug (known as \u201cPEGylation\u201d) may be accomplished by known chemical synthesis techniques. For example, the PEGylation of protein may be accomplished by reacting NETS-activated PEG with the protein under suitable reaction conditions.</p>While numerous reactions have been described for PEGylation, those that are most generally applicable confer directionality, utilize mild reaction conditions, and do not necessitate extensive downstream processing to remove toxic catalysts or bi-products. For instance, monomethoxy PEG (mPEG) has only one reactive terminal hydroxyl, and thus its use limits some of the heterogeneity of the resulting PEG-protein product mixture. Activation of the hydroxyl group at the end of the polymer opposite to the terminal methoxy group is generally necessary to accomplish efficient protein PEGylation, with the aim being to make the derivatized PEG more susceptible to nucleophilic attack. The attacking nucleophile is usually the epsilon-amino group of a lysyl residue, but other amines also can react (e.g., the N-terminal alpha-amine or the ring amines of histidine) if local conditions are favorable. A more directed attachment is possible in proteins containing a single lysine or cysteine. The latter residue can be targeted by PEG-maleimide for thiol-specific modification. Alternatively, PEG hydrazide can be reacted with a periodate oxidized hyaluronan degrading enzyme and reduced in the presence of NaCNBH<sub>3</sub>. ",
    "d hyaluronidases, PEG aldehydes, succinimides and carbonates have each been applied to conjugate PEG moieties, typically succinimidyl PEGs, to rHuPH20. For example, rHuPH20 has been conjugated with exemplary succinimidyl monoPEG (mPEG) reagents including mPEG-Succinimidyl Propionates (mPEG-SPA), mPEG-Succinimidyl Butanoates (mPEG-SBA), and (for attaching \u201cbranched\u201d PEGs) mPEG2-N-Hydroxyl succinimide. These pegylated succinimidyl esters contain different length carbon backbones between the PEG group and the activated cross-linker, and either a single or branched PEG group. These differences can be used, for example, to provide for different reaction kinetics and to potentially restrict sites available for PEG attachment to rHuPH20 during the conjugation process.</p>Succinimidyl PEGs (as above) comprising either linear or branched PEGs can be conjugated to rHuPH20. PEGs can used to generate rHuPH20s reproducibly comprising a combination of molecules having between about three to six PEG molecules per hyaluronidase. Such pegylated rHuPH20 compositions can be readily purified to yield compositions having specific activities of approximately 25,000 or 30,000 Unit/mg protein hyaluronidase activity, and being substantially free of non-PEGylated rHuPH20 (less than 5% non-PEGylated).</p>Using various PEG reagents, exemplary versions of hyaluronan degrading enzymes, in particular soluble human recombinant hyaluronidases (e.g., rHuPH20), can be prepared, for example, using mPEG-SBA (30 kD), mPEG-SMB (30 kD), and branched versions based on mPEG2-NHS (40 kD), mPEG2-NHS (60 kD). PEGylated versions of rHuPH20 have been generated using NHS chemistries, as well as carbonates, and aldehydes, using each of the following reagents: mPEG2-NHS-40K branched, mPEG-NHS-10K branched, mPEG-NHS-20K branched, mPEG-NHS-40K branched, mPEG2-NHS-60K branched; mPEG-SBA-5K; mPEG-SBA-20K; mPEG-SBA-30K; mPEG-SMB-20K; mPEG-SMB-30K; mPEG-butyraldehyde-; mPEG-SPA-20K; mPEG-SPA-30K; and PEG-NHS-5K-biotin. PEGylated hyaluronidases have also been prepared using PEG reagents available from Dowpharma, a division of Dow Chemical Corporation; including hyaluronidases PEGylated with Dowpharma's p-nitrophenyl-carbonate PEG (30 kDa) and with propionaldehyde PEG (30 kDa).</p>In one example, the PEGylation includes conjugation of mPEG-SBA, for example, mPEG-SBA-30K (having a molecular weight of about 30 Kda) or another succinimidyl esters of PEG butanoic acid derivative, to a soluble hyaluronidase. Succinimidyl esters of PEG butanoic acid derivatives, such as mPEG-SBA-30K readily couple to amino groups of proteins. For example, covalent conjugation of m-PEG-SBA-30K and rHuPH20 (which is approximately 60 KDa in size) provides stable amide bonds between rHuPH20 and mPEG, as shown in Scheme 1, below.</p><img id=\"EMI-C00001\" path=\"US20190336587A1-20191107-C00001.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/575968133/US/20191107/A1/020190/33/65/87/US20190336587A1-20191107-C00001.TIF\"/></p>Typically, the mPEG-SBA-30K or other PEG is added to the hyaluronan degrading enzyme, in s",

After the particles had settled, the cultures were viewed at 100\u00d7 magnification. Pericellular matrix halos were identified as the areas staining positive by IHC for HA, and the areas from which particles (RBCs) were excluded in the particle exclusion assay.</p>The \u201chalo area\u201d was determined by measuring the pixels staining positively for HA (immunohistochemistry), or the mm<sup>2 </sup>of the area from which RBCs were excluded (particle exclusion assay). The average cell area was determined in a similar manner in pixels or mm<sup>2 </sup>for each assay, respectively. The \u201chalo area per cell area\u201d then was derived by dividing the halo area by the average cell area for fields for each sample. \u201cPercent halo\u201d then was determined by setting the halo area per cell for the control sample (media alone) as 100% and the halo area per cell for the 1000 U-PH20-treated hyaluronan-degraded H460 cells (from Example 6A, above) as zero. The results are presented in Table 16, below. This Table lists the average \u201cpercent halo\u201d for each study condition (doses of PEGylated rHuPH20); each condition was performed in triplicate wells and 25 cells counted per well (total n=75 cells counted); standard error of the mean (SEM) is shown. The data revealed that the half maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) of PEGylated rHuPH20 in reducing Halos in this study was 3.1 U/mL (0.09 \u03bcg/mL).

PEGylated rHuPH20 Inhibits Colony Growth of PC3 Cells In Vitro\n</p>To determine whether PEGylated rHuPH20 can inhibit anchorage-independent growth and proliferation of hyaluronan-rich prostate tumor cells (PC3) in vitro, a three-dimensional clonogenic assay was performed on cells. PC3 cells, at approximately 80% confluency, were trypsinized, harvested, and washed once in completed medium. Cell density was adjusted to 8\u00d710<sup>4</sup>/mL cells and suspended in Matrigel\u00ae (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.) on ice. 0.025 mL of this cell/Matrigel\u00ae mixture were seeded onto a 48 well cell culture plate that had been pre-coated with Matrigel\u00ae at 0.1 mL per well, and solidified at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 hour. For continuous exposure, over 17 days, to control API buffer and various concentrations of PEGylated rHuPH20, 0.6 mL/well of completed medium containing API buffer, 1, 3, 10 and 100 U/mL of PEGylated rHuPH20 were added to the top of the appropriate well.

    "educed the distal tumor IFP by an average of 88.6%, compared to baseline, indicating that PEGylated soluble hyaluronidase has an increased and/or sustained effect on IFP compared with native enzyme.</p>Next, in order to determine whether the effect of rHuPH20 on interstitial fluid pressure were dose-dependent, the method described in Example 6B, above, was carried out using 10 groups of PC3 xenograft mice (7 mice per group), each group being treated as described above, with 100, 1000, 3000, 7000 (PEGylated rHuPH20 only) or 10,000 units of PEGylated or native rHuPH20, or control carrier buffer, was administered intravenously by tail vein injection. IFP was measured prior to, during and continuously following the administration. IFP was measured until 120 minutes post-administration.</p>Results revealed that intravenous administration of both native and PEGylated rHuPH20 reduced distal tumor IFP in a dose-dependent manner. Several doses of PEGylated rHuPH20 resulted in greater decreases in IFP by one and two hours following administration. For example, in this exemplary experiment, after 120 minutes, administration of 1000 units of native rHuPH20 resulted in an approximately 30% reduction in tumor IFP (roughly 70% compared to control), while administration of the same dose (1000 units) of PEG rHuPH20 reduced tumor IFP by greater than 50% (roughly 48% of control). IFP reduction at the highest doses (3,000-10,000 U/mouse) of PEGylated rHuPH20 was greater than 80% at 120 minutes. IC50 (for % IFP inhibition at 120 minutes following PEGylated rHuPH20 treatment) was 807.6 U/mouse. The three highest dose (3000, 7000 and 10,000 U PEGylated rHuPH20/mouse) effects appeared to plateau at this time-point.</p>B. Intravenous Administration of PEGylated rHuPH20 Results in Prolonged Tumor IFP Suppression</p>To determine whether the increased duration of in vivo activity with PEGylated rHuPH20, as observed in Example 8, translated into prolonged suppression of tumor IFP, groups of PC3 xenograft model animals (4 animals per group) were injected intravenously with carrier buffer or 10,000 units of PEGylated rHuPH20 as described above, and IFP measured, as described in Example 6B, at 8 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours post administration.</p>Similar experiments had shown that distal tumor IFP returned to control levels by 24 hours following administration of native rHuPH20. By contrast, in this experiment, IFP was reduced by at least about 50% at 8 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours following intravenous administration of a single dose of 10,000 units PEGylated rHuPH20. In this experiment, the average tumor IFP approached control levels by 72 hours. These results indicate that PEGylated rHuPH20 can be administered intravenously to effect prolonged interstitial fluid pressure decreases at distal tumor sites.</p>C.
