    "ch features may be accomplished at least in part by using a synthetic template for the formation of the nanostructures. For example, high-density lipoprotein synthetic nanoparticles (HDL-NP) may be formed by using a gold </p>nanoparticle (Au-NP) (or other suitable entity or material) as a synthetic template to which other components (e.g., lipids, proteins, etc.) can be added. </p> In some embodiments, the synthetic nanostructures may have a substantially similar size, shape and/or surface chemistry to that of natural HDL, but may differ in at least one characteristic from that of natural HDL. The at least one characteristic may be, for example, the presence or absence of one or more components in the nanostructure, the positioning of one or more components in or on the nanostructure, the materials used to form the nanostructure, the makeup of the shell of the nanostructure, the makeup of the core of the nanostructure, and combinations thereof. For example, in some embodiments, the nanostructures can be made substantially free of cholesterol (e.g., in the core, and/or prior to administration of the nanostructures to a subject or sample) as the Au-NP or other suitable entity occupies the real-estate at the core. This configuration differs from that of natural HDLs, which have a core formed of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides. Furthermore, the nanostructures described herein may have certain characteristics and/or functions similar to that of natural HDL (e.g., cholesterol binding constant) but may have other characteristics and/or functions that differ from that of natural HDL (e.g., ability to deliver cholesterol to cells). The differences between the nanostructures described herein and natural HDLs may contribute to the effectiveness of the nanostructures in treating the cells, diseases and conditions described herein, as described in more detail below. \n\n Cholesterol in cell membranes appears to be important for the survival and proliferation of malignant cells. As a therapy, and in direct contrast to natural HDL, the nanostructures described herein may induce time and dose-dependent apoptosis in cancer cells such as those having scavenger receptor type B-I (SR-B1), B-cell lymphoma cells, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cells, melanoma cells and/or others. For example, data demonstrate that the therapeutic efficacy of the nanostructures may be derived by targeting the high affinity receptor for HDL, SR-B1, and/or by the ability of the nanostructure to manipulate cellular cholesterol flux. Taken together, targeted nanostructure receptor binding, which may be achieved through the surface chemistry of the nanostructures, and/or manipulation of cellular cholesterol flux, which may be achieved through features of the nanostructure such as the occupancy of the core, may uniquely cooperate to deliver significant potential therapeutic efficacy as an alternative to chemotherapy for cancers such as B-cell lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, melanoma or others.

    "ructures are circulated indefinitely from the periphery to the liver and out again, relative few cholesterol molecules need to be sequestered by each structure in order for the composition to be effective, since the structures are recycled. On the other hand, if a composition is used, for example, as a \n\n cholesterol or bile- salt binding resin orally, each structure may sequester a larger number of cholesterol to increased cholesterol uptake. Also, if the structures are of a size such that they are rapidly excreted (e.g., through the liver or urine) after sequestering cholesterol, a high uptake of cholesterol per structure, and/or continuous infusion may be implemented. As such, a single structure described herein, which may be incorporated into a pharmaceutical composition or other formulation, may be able to sequester any suitable number of a particular type of molecule (e.g., lipids such as cholesterol; steroids such as estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone; bile salts, etc.) during use, e.g., at least 2, at least 5, at least 10, at least 20, at least 30, at least 50, at least 100, at least 200, at least 500, at least 1,000, at least 2,000, at least 5,000, or at least 10,000 molecules, which may depend on the size (e.g., surface area and/or volume) of the structure, the particular application, and the method of administration. In some cases, such numbers of molecules can be bound to the structure at one particular instance. </p> In some cases, a single structure has a binding constant for cholesterol, K^, of, for example, less than or equal to about 100 \u03bc\u039c, less than or equal to about 10 \u03bc\u039c, less than or equal to about 1 \u03bc\u039c, less than or equal to about 0.1 \u03bc\u039c, less than or equal to about 10 nM, less than or equal to about 7 nM, less than or equal to about 5 nM, less than or equal to about 2 nM, less than or equal to about 1 nM, less than or equal to about 0.1 nM, less than or equal to about 10 pM, less than or equal to about 1 pM, less than or equal to about 0.1 pM, less than or equal to about 10 fM, or less than or equal to about 1 fM.</p>Methods for determining the amount of cholesterol sequestered and binding constants are provided in more detail below. </p> In certain embodiments, the molecules that are sequestered by the structures described herein cause the structure to grow in size (e.g., cross- sectional area, surface area and/or volume), e.g., depending on the number of molecules sequestered. The molecules may associate with a surface of a structure, be imbedded in a shell of a structure, be transported to a core of the structure, or combinations thereof, as described herein. As such, the size of a structure (e.g., cross-sectional area, surface area and/or volume) can increase by at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 50%, at least 70%, or at least 100%, from a time prior to sequestration compared to a time after/during sequestration in some embodiments. </p> It should be understood, however, that while ma",
    "ermine a disease or condition of the subject or biological sample. At least a portion of the structures may be retrieved from the subject or biological sample and an assay may be performed with the structures retrieved. The structures may be assayed for the amount and/or type of molecules bound to or otherwise \n\n sequestered by the structures. For example, in one set of embodiments, a competition assay is performed, e.g., where labeled cholesterol is added and displacement of cholesterol is monitored. The more measured uptake of labeled cholesterol, the less bound un-labeled free cholesterol is present. This can be done, for example, after a composition comprising the structures described herein are administered to a subject or a biological sample, and the structures are subsequently retrieved from the subject or biological sample. This method can be used, for example, where the structures are to be used as a diagnostic agent to see how much cholesterol (unlabeled) it has sequestered in a subject or biological sample. </p> Other methods can also be used to determine the amount of cholesterol sequestered by structures described herein. In some cases, labeled cholesterol (e.g., fluorescently-labeled cholesterol such as NBD-cholesterol, or radioactive cholesterol) can be used. Labeled cholesterol can be added to the structures either in vitro or in vitro. By adding structures without labeled cholesterol and measuring the fluorescence increase upon binding, one can calculate the binding constant of labeled cholesterol to the structure. In addition, to remove the cholesterol from the structure, one can dissolve the particle (e.g., KCN) and then measure the resultant fluorescence in solution. Comparing to standard curve can allow determination of the number of cholesterol molecules per particle. Other methods such as organic extraction and quantitative mass spectrometry can also be used to calculate amount of cholesterol sequestered by one or more structures described herein. </p> As described herein, the inventive structures may be used in \"pharmaceutical compositions\" or \"pharmaceutically acceptable\" compositions, which comprise a therapeutically effective amount of one or more of the structures described herein, formulated together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, additives, and/or diluents. The pharmaceutical compositions described herein may be useful for treating cancer or other conditions. In some cases, the pharmaceutical compositions described herein may be used for killing cancer cells. Examples of cancers and cancer cells include those having scavenger receptor type B-I (SR-B1), B-cell lymphoma cells, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cells, melanoma cells and/or others. It should be understood that any suitable structures described herein can be used in such pharmaceutical compositions, including those described in connection with the figures. In some cases, the structures in a pharmaceutical composition have a nanostructure core"
