    "1.5 ml of 400 \u03bcg/mL temsirolimus/4.0 mg/mL dexamethasone) in the tissue around each injured femoral artery, for a total of two doses per animal. In each case, all temsirolimus treated animals undergo perivascular infusion into the femoral artery adventitia. Two pigs are sacrificed at each time point of 3 days, 7 days, and 28 days post-procedure, and each pig is analyzed for histopathology, pharmacokinetics, and safety evaluation. </p> [0190] Control group. Six pigs serve as control animals. Each pig receives 2 injury sites in femoral arteries, for a total of 12 injury sites among the 6 pigs. Each injury site receives 1.5 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride (saline) diluted 4: 1 ratio with contrast medium (Isovue-370). Two pigs are sacrificed at each time point of 3 days, 7 days, and 28 days post-procedure, and each pig is analyzed for histopathology, pharmacokinetics, and safety evaluation. </p>[0191] All treatment and control group animals will successfully receive their respective injection administered directly to the adventitia and perivascular tissues of the femoral arteries. All injection sites except the two control sites will have complete or partial circumferential and longitudinal coverage of the target site by the injection. </p> [0192] Safety Evaluation. Local and systemic toxicity is assessed by clinical observations and clinical pathology either during the survival duration or by analysis of tissues post mortem. </p>[0193] Outcomes. Cellular proliferation as measured by Ki-67 expression, BrdU expression, histopathology, pharmacokinetics, and safety evaluation will be compared for treatment and control groups to ascertain the effect of combination therapy on restenosis in a porcine model. Example 8: Porcine Model of Femoral Vessel Injury with Sequential Combination </p>Therapy </p> [0194] The general method of Example 7 is followed, with the modification that the researcher wants to study the effects of sequential treatment with both drugs. The combination </p>temsirolimus/dexamethasone-treatment group is removed, the temsirolimus group receives a dexamethasone injection 24 hours after treatment, and the dexamethasone group receives a temsirolimus injection 24 hours after treatment. Outcomes are evaluated in a similar manner, and the effect of sequential treatment is ascertained. \n\n Example 9: Porcine Model of Femoral Vessel Injury with Paclitaxel </p>[0195] The general method of Example 7 is followed, with the modification that the researcher replaces temsirolimus with paclitaxel, in dosages described herein. Outcomes are evaluated in a similar manner. </p> Example 10: Porcine Model of Femoral Vessel Injury with Sequential Paclitaxel </p>Combination Therapy </p> [0196] The general method of Example 8 is followed, with the modification that the researcher replaces temsirolimus with paclitaxel, in dosages described herein. Outcomes are evaluated in a similar manner, and the effect of sequential treatment is ascertained. </p>Example 11: In- Vit"
