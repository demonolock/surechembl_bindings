    "ll white GREINER PS, CELLSTAR, uClear tissue culture plate. To distribute the compound solution evenly in the \n\n medium before adding the cells, 10ul of cell culture medium are added to each well of the compound containing plate using the MULTIDROP 384 dispenser and shaken vigorously. Cells are detached from the flask after a short incubation with trypsin-EDTA, counted and diluted to a concentration of 1.5x10<sup>6</sup>cells/ml in culture medium. The expression of Smurf-1 is induced by adding doxycyline to a final concentration of 0.2ug/ml. 10ul of the cell suspension are added to each well of the compound-containing plates by using the MULTIDROP 384 dispenser. The plates are incubated over night at 37\u00b0C, 5%C0<sub>2</sub>. In this assay the compound concentrations range from 6.75 nM to 22.5 uM in an 8-point dose-response curve. </p>After overnight incubation with the compounds the levels of Smurf-1 are determined using the PathHunter Prolabel detection kit from DiscoverX. First 10 ul of a lysis/CL detection working solution are added manually using a multi-channel step-pi pettor, followed by the addition of 5 ul enzyme acceptor EA. The plates are mixed on a plate shaker and incubated for 2-3hours at room-temperature before measuring the chemiluminescent signal in the PherStar plate reader. Compounds of the Examples, herein below, have Smurf-1 and Smurf-2 IC<sub>50</sub> values in the data measurements described above as shown in Table 1. </p>Table 1 . </p> Example Smurf-1 / IC50 \u03bc\u039c Smurf-2 / IC50 \u03bc\u039c </p> 1 0.2400 5.6000 </p> 2 0.4100 8.5500 </p> 3 0.0170 0.8300 </p> 4 0.0026 0.7250 </p> 5 0.0918 8.3500 </p> 7 0.5683 10.0000 </p> 1 1 1 .4167 10.0000 </p> 13 0.2725 7.8500 </p> 19 0.0225 0.7400 </p> 22 0.4950 10.0000 </p> 27 0.1250 5.8000 </p> 28 0.6600 10.0000 </p> 29 1 .0600 10.0000 \n\n 30 0.6800 6.8500 </p> 32 0.6950 10.0000 </p> 34 0.0292 9.5000 </p> 35 0.0059 1 .0508 </p> 37 1 .0450 10.0000 </p> 38 0.8650 10.0000 </p> 39 0.2000 5.5500 </p> 41 0.0045 0.3900 </p> 43 0.0580 20.0000 </p> 45 0.0022 0.1750 </p> 46 0.0315 10.0000 </p> 47 1 .1300 10.0000 </p> 50 0.4625 10.0000 </p> 51 0.6575 10.0000 </p> 53 0.1325 10.0000 </p> 54 0.1925 10.0000 </p> 55 9.9000 10.0000 </p> 56 3.8000 20.0000 </p> 57 2.7000 20.0000 </p>The invention is illustrated by the following Examples. </p>Examples </p>Referring to the examples that follow, compounds of the preferred embodiments are </p>synthesized using the methods described herein, or other methods, which are known in the art. </p>It should be understood that the organic compounds according to the preferred embodiments may exhibit the phenomenon of tautomerism.
