    " therapeutic effect in the patient, comprising administering to the patient in need thereof an effective amount of a compound according to the present disclosure, optionally in combination with another bioactive agent. The disease state or condition may be a disease caused by a microbial agent or other exogenous agent (e.g., a virus, bacterium, fungus, protozoan, or other microorganism), or may be a disease state caused by overexpression of a protein, which results in a disease state and/or condition.</p>The term \"disease state or condition\" is used to describe any disease state or condition in which a protein imbalance occurs (i.e., the amount of protein expressed in a patient is increased), and in which degradation of one or more proteins in a patient can provide beneficial therapy or relief of symptoms to a patient in need thereof. In some cases, the disease state or condition may be cured.</p>Disease states or conditions that may be treated using compounds according to the present disclosure include, for example, asthma, autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, various cancers, fibroses, cleft palate, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, inflammatory bowel disease, mental retardation, mood disorders, obesity, ametropia, infertility, angelman syndrome, canavan disease, celiac disease, charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, cystic fibrosis, duchenne muscular dystrophy, hemochromatosis, hemophilia, kerr syndrome, neurofibromatosis, phenylketonuria, polycystic kidney disease (PKD 1) or 4 (PKD 2), prader-Willi syndrome, sickle cell disease, tay-Sachs disease, turner syndrome.</p>The term \"neoplasia\" or \"cancer\" is used throughout the specification to refer to the pathological process of formation and growth of an oncogenic or malignant tumor (i.e., abnormal tissue that grows by cell proliferation), which is generally faster than normal tissue and continues to grow after the stimulus that initiated the new growth ceases. Malignant tumors show a partial or complete lack of structural tissue and functional coordination with normal tissue, and most invade surrounding tissue, metastasize to several sites, and may recur after attempted removal and cause patient death unless adequately treated. As used herein, the term neoplasia is used to describe all cancerous disease states and includes or encompasses pathological processes associated with malignant blood borne, ascites, and solid tumors. Exemplary cancers that may be treated by the compounds of the invention, alone or in combination with at least one additional anticancer agent, include squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, bowel carcinoma, breast carcinoma, cervical carcinoma, colon carcinoma, esophageal carcinoma, head carcinoma, renal carcinoma, liver carcinoma, lung carcinoma, neck carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, prostate carcinoma, stomach carcinoma, leukemia, benign lymphoma, malignant lymphoma, bu",
