This correlation was observed using two different types of analysis (Spearman correlation between c-Myc expression and EC50, and dividing cells by high and low expression of c-Myc and comparing both groups) and was found to be observed for a selection of structurally diverse NMT inhibitors in different types of cancer cell lines (e.g. 676 to 913 cancer cell lines).</p>Furthermore, the inventors also observed that one or more structural alterations in the MYC locus (e.g. MYCN and MYCL) correlated significantly with an increased sensitivity to an NMT inhibitor. These observations were again consistent across three pharmacogenomics screens, and upon using a selection of structurally diverse NMT inhibitors and different cancer cell lines (676 cancer cell lines). See, for example, FIG. 26.</p>In addition to these strong correlations, the inventors also discovered that when the expression of c-MYC or MYCN was enforced in three different genetically modified cell lines, an increase in the responsiveness to an NMT inhibitor was observed, as evidenced by the lower effective concentrations of NMT inhibitor needed to impart cell death in cell lines with high MYC expression compared to those with low MYC expression, and also the shorter timeframes for cell death\u2014see, for instance, FIGS. 4, 5, 14 and 15.</p>The oncogenes c-MYC and MYCN are common diagnostic markers for particularly aggressive types of malignancies and there are recent findings demonstrating that c-MYC and MYCN overexpression and/or mutation correlate strongly with some of the worst clinical outcomes (Jung et al., Tumor and Stem Cell Biolo",

Suitably, the MYC dysregulated cancer is any one of the MYC dysregulated cancers described hereinabove.</p>The present invention also provides a NMT inhibitor, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or hydrate thereof, for use in combination with one or more other therapeutic agents in the treatment of a cancer comprising one or more structural alterations of the MYC locus. Suitably, the cancer comprising one or more structural alterations of the MYC locus is any one of the cancers comprising one or more structural alterations of the MYC locus described hereinabove.</p>Suitable, but non-limiting, examples of other therapeutic agents which may be administered in combination with the NMT inhibitor include one or more other chemotherapeutic agents.</p>For example, the NMT inhibitor may be administered in addition to any currently recommended treatment (also known as the \u201cstandard of care\u201d) for cancer.</p>N-Myristoyl Transferase (NMT) InhibitorsN-myristoyl transferase (NMT) is a monomeric enzyme, which is ubiquitous in eukaryotes. NMT catalyses an irreversible co-translational transfer of myristic acid (a saturated 14-carbon fatty acid) from myristoyl-Coenzyme A (myr-CoA) to a protein substrate containing an N-terminal glycine with formation of an amide bond (Farazi, T. A., G. Waksman, and J. I. Gordon, J. Biol. Chem., 2001. 276(43): p. 39501-39504).</p>There are two types of human NMT, human NMT1 (HsNMT1) and human NMT2 (HsNMT2). Inhibition of human NMT has been suggested as a target for treating or preventing various diseases or disorders, for example hyperproliferative disorders (cancers, e.g. human colorectal cancer, gallbladder carcinoma, brain tumours, and lymphomas such as B-cell lymphoma) (Resh M D. 1993. Biochem. Biophys. Acta 1115, 307-22; Berthiaume L G, Beauchamp E, WO2017/011907). As NMT plays a key role in protein trafficking, mediation of protein-protein interactions, stabilization of protein structures and signal transduction in living systems, inhibition of the NMT enzyme has the potential to disrupt multi-protein pathways. This is an attractive characteristic to reduce the risk of the development of resistance in, for example, treatment or prevention of hyperproliferative disorders.</p>Compounds active as inhibitors of NMT have previously been disclosed, see for example WO00/37464 (Roche), WO2010/026365 (University of Dundee), WO2013/083991 (Imperial Innovations Limited) and WO2017/001812 (Imperial Innovations Limited), and their use in the treatment of cancer has been described.</p>Thus, the NMT inhibitors for use in the present invention are species (e.g. compounds) which display activity as inhibitors of N-myristoyl transferase (NMT). Furthermore, the term \u201cNMT inhibitor\u201d as used herein will be understood to cover any species which binds to NMT and inhibits its activity. The inhibitors may act as competitive inhibitors, or partial competitive inhibitors. The inhibitor may bind to NMT at the myr-CoA binding pocket or at the peptide binding pocket (or inhibit NMT through another mechanism). The NMT inhibitor of the present invention preferably bind and inhibit NMT through the peptide binding pocket.</p>Suitably, the NMT inhibitors for use in the present invention are compounds which display activity as inhibitors of N-myristoyl transferase (NMT). Suitable compounds which display activity as inhibitors of NMT are known in the art. Non-limiting examples of suitable NMT inhibitors are described in, for example, WO00",

For example, it may be the hydrochloric (HCl) salt.</p>Compounds that have the same molecular formula but differ in the nature or sequence of bonding of their atoms or the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed \u201cisomers\u201d. Isomers that differ in the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed \u201cstereoisomers\u201d. Stereoisomers that are not mirror images of one another are termed \u201cdiastereomers\u201d and those that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other are termed \u201cenantiomers\u201d. When a compound has an asymmetric center, for example, it is bonded to four different groups, a pair of enantiomers is possible. An enantiomer can be characterized by the absolute configuration of its asymmetric center and is described by the R- and S-sequencing rules of Cahn and Prelog, or by the manner in which the molecule rotates the plane of polarized light and designated as dextrorotatory or levorotatory (i.e., as (+) or (\u2212)-isomers respectively). A chiral compound can exist as either individual enantiomer or as a mixture thereof. A mixture containing equal proportions of the enantiomers is called a \u201cracemic mixture\u201d.</p>The NMT inhibitor may possess one or more asymmetric centers; such compounds can therefore be produced as individual (R)- or (S)-stereoisomers or as mixtures thereof. It is to be understood that the NMT inhibitors for use in the present invention encompasses all optical, diastereoisomers and geometric isomers and mixtures thereof that possess NMT inhibition activity.</p>The present invention also encompasses NMT inhibitors as defined herein which comprise one or more isotopic substitutions. For example, H may be in any isotopic form, including 1H, 2H(D), and 3H (T); C may be in any isotopic form, including 12C, 13C, and 14C; and O may be in any isotopic form, including 160 and 180; and the like.</p>Those skilled in the art of organic chemistry will appreciate that many organic compounds can form complexes with solvents in which they are reacted or from which they are precipitated or crystallized. These complexes are known as \u201csolvates\u201d. For example, a complex with water is known as a \u201chydrate\u201d. Solvates, such as hydrates, exist when the drug substance incorporates solvent, such as water, in the crystal lattice in either stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts. Drug substances are routinely screened for the existence of hydrates since these may be encountered at any stage of the drug manufacturing process or upon storage of the drug substance or dosage form. Solvates are described in S. Byrn et al., Pharmaceutical Research, 1995. 12(7): p. 954-954, and Water-Insoluble Drug Formulation, 2<sup>nd </sup>ed. R. Liu, CRC Press, page 553, which are incorporated herein by reference. Accordingly, it will be understood by the skilled person that the NMT inhibitors for use in the present invention may be present in the form of solvates, wherein the associated solvent is a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent.

On day 2 (24 hours of incubation), the RNA was purified with the miRNeasy kit, according to manufacturer's instructions.</p>Gene Set Enrichment AnalysisGene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed using GSEA (v3.0) (Subramanian et. al., PNAS, 2005, 102(43), 15545-15550). Gene sets were obtained from the Broad Institute Signatures data base (http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp). For the in-house RNAseq data, GSEA was carried out with ranked gene lists, using Wald statistics. All parameters were kept as default, except for the enrichment statistic (classic) and the max size that was changed to 500.000 respectively. For the microarray data, the pre-processed data was obtained from the Sanger Institute (Lorio et al., Cell, 2016, 166(3), 740-754; https://www.cancerrxgene.org/downloads). All parameters were kept as default, except the max size that was changed to 500,000 respectively. For the RNAseq data and CRISPR data sets from the Broad Institute, the pre-processed data was obtained from the DepMap project (CCLE and GDSC Consortium, Nature, 2015, 528, 84-87 and Robin et. al., Nature Genetics, 2017, 49(12), 1779-1784; https://depmap.org/portal/download/; Public 18Q4 Versions). All parameters in the GSEA were kept to default, except the max size that was changed to 500.000 respectively.</p>Pharmacogenomics ScreensThe sensitivity data, measured as EC50, for cancer cell lines treated with Compound 4, Compound 3, and Compound 6 were provided by the Sanger Institute, using their methods described in Lorio et. al., Cell, 2016,166(3), 740-754. The sensitivity data, measured as EC50, on Compound 3 and Compound 4 is not yet published; the sensitivity data for Compound 6 is available on: https://www.cancerrxgene.org/translation/Drug/1266. For the microarray data, copy number data, recurrently altered chromosomal segments data, and genomic variants, used to compare the expression of different genes or the presence/absence of structural alterations in the Myc paralogs loci with sensitivity, the pre-processed data was obtained from the Sanger Institute (https://www.cancerrxgene.org/downloads).</p>ResultsNMT InhibitionThe NMT inhibition activity data for Compounds 1, 2, 3 and 4 is described in WO2017/001812. In particular, the NMT inhibition data is provided in Table 1 of WO2017/001812.</p>The inhibition activity data for Compound 6 is described in WO2010/026365, more specifically in the Table on page 118 of WO2010/026365.</p>Compounds 5 and 7Example (a); HsNMT1 IC<sub>50 </sub>The IC<sub>50 </sub>values for human NMT1 (HsNMT1) of Compounds 5 and 7 were measured using a sensitive fluorescence-based assay based on detection of CoA by 7-diethylamino-3-(4-maleimido-phenyl)-4-methylcoumarin, as described in Goncalves, V., et al., Analytical Biochemistry, 2012, 421, 342-344 and Goncalves, V., et al., J. Med. Chem, 2012, 55, 3578.</p>The HsNMT1 IC<sub>50 </sub>value for Compound 5 was observed to be 1.5 nM.</p>The HsNMT1 IC<sub>50 </sub>value for Compound 7 was observed to be 0.4 nM.</p>Example (b) Metabolic Activity Assay (MTS Assay)Compounds 5 and 7 were also tested for activity in an in vitro metabolic activity assay using the human cell line MRC5. Compounds having activity in inhibiting metabolic activity in the assay are expected to be useful as agents for preventing and/or treating cancer, by virtue of being inhibitors of human NMT1 and/or NMT2. The compounds with the highest activity in the assay are expected to be the most potent inhibitors of human NMT1 and/or NMT2.</p>Cell PreparationMRC5 cells (cell type: fibroblast cells) were grown in DMEM media (supplemented with 10% FBS) and were seeded in a 96-well plate, 24 h prior to treatment. Cell suspensions were prepared by adjusting the cell density to the appropriate concentration (as stated in the Table 1 below) and 50 \u03bcL of the cell suspension was transferred to wells B-G in columns 2-11 of a 96-well plate.</p>TABLE 1Number of cells platedMRC5Cell suspension38,000concentration (cells/mL)cells per well1,900</p>Assay Procedure100 \u03bcL of growth media (DMEM media) containing 0.2% DMSO was added to wells B-G in columns 2 and 11 as positive controls, and 100 \u03bcL of growth media containing Puromycin (3 \u03bcg/mL; final concentration in the plate 2 \u03bcg/mL) was added to wells B-G in column 3 as a negative control. Seven concentrations of NMT inhibitor stock solution were prepared for Compound 5 (same final percentage of DMSO, dilution factor=3 starting from 15 \u03bcM or 150 \u03bcM). 100 \u03bcL of inhibitor stock solution was added to wells B-G in columns 4-10 of a 96-well plate (final concentration of Compound 5 in the plate starting from 10 \u03bcM or 100 \u03bcM; total volume in each well was 150 \u03bcL). The plate was incubated at 37\u00b0 C. with 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>level.</p>After 72 h, 20 \u03bcL MTS reagent (Promega, prepared according to the supplier protocol) was added to each well of the 96-well plate. The plate was incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 2 h and the absorbance per well was measured at 490 nm with an EnVision plate reader. The average absorbance value of the negative control (Puromycin-treated cells) was subtracted from each value and the metabolic activity was calculated as a percentage relative to the positive control (DMSO-treated cells). EC50 values were calculated using GraphPad.</p>The EC<sub>50 </sub>value for Compound 5 was observed to be 13 nM.</p>The EC<sub>50 </sub>value for Compound 7 was observed to be 37 nM.</p>Correlations Between Alterations in MYC and the Effectiveness of a NMT InhibitorP-493-6 Cell LinesValidation of the P-493-6 Cell LinesFIGS. 1, 2 and 3 show the flow cytometry analysis for the expression of c-MYC in the P-493-6 cell line. This data shows that the genetically engineered P-493-6 cell lines (immortalised B cell lines with an inducible system) allow for three different MYC levels: high, medium and low (as defined above). This makes the P-493-6 cell line a particularly good cell line to use for determining the correlation between the effectiveness of an NMT inhibitor and MYC expression.</p>High levels of MYC expression was found to cause increased cell size, which was measured and determined by increased forward scatter.</p>FIG. 1 shows: a) representative flow cytometry analysis for the expression of the c-Myc in the P-493-6 cell line from an unstained control (first row), low levels of c-Myc (second row), medium levels of c-Myc (third row), and high levels of c-Myc (fourth row); b) quantification of the median fluorescence intensities (MFI), normalised against the unstained control of the expression levels of c-Myc (N=3); c) representative flow cytometry analysis for the forward scatter area (FSC-A) as a surrogate for cell size in the P-493-6 cell line from low levels of c-Myc (fi",

On the other hand, the cell line without activated MYCN was observed to stops cycling at 48 hours.</p>Global CorrelationsThe GDSC data shown in FIGS. 20-22 indicates a correlation between c-MYC expression and sensitivity to an NMT inhibitor. A trend was observed indicating that increased c-MYC correlates well with higher sensitivity to the three different NMT inhibitors tested in the Sanger cancer line drug screen. Contrary to previous disclosures in the art (see, for example, WO2017/011907A1), FIG. 23 shows that there is no correlation between the expression of hsNMT1 or hsNMT2 with the sensitivity to an NMT inhibitor.</p>FIG. 20 shows: a) global comparison of the correlation between sensitivity to the NMT inhibitor Compound 6, measured as EC50, and normalised c-MYC expression (the expression data was obtained from Lorio et. al., Cell, 2016, 166(3), 740-754 and a nonparametric Spearman correlation coefficient was used); b) comparison between the top quartile and bottom quartile of cells with the highest (dashed/grey) and lowest expression (black) and their respective responsiveness to the NMT inhibitor Compound 6 (a nonparametric Mann Whitney test was used).</p>FIG. 21 shows: a) global comparison of the correlation between sensitivity to the NMT inhibitor Compound 4, measured as EC50, and normalised c-MYC expression (the expression data was obtained from Lorio et. al., Cell, 2016, 166(3), 740-754 and a nonparametric Spearman correlation coefficient was used); and b) comparison between the top quartile and bottom quartile of cells with the highest (dashed/grey) and lowest expression (black) and their respective responsiveness to the NMT inhibitor Compound 4 (a nonparametric Mann Whitney test was used).</p>FIG. 22 shows: a) global comparison of the correlation between sensitivity to the NMT inhibitor Compound 3, measured as EC50, and normalised c-MYC expression (the expression data was obtained from Lorio et. al., Cell, 2016, 166(3), 740-754 and a nonparametric Spearman correlation coefficient was used); b) comparison between the top quartile and bottom quartile of cells with the highest (dashed/grey) and lowest expression (black) and their respective responsiveness to the NMT inhibitor Compound 3 (a nonparametric Mann Whitney test was used).</p>FIG. 23 shows: a.) top: global comparison of the correlation between sensitivity to the NMT inhibitor Compound 4, measured as EC50, and normalised NMT1 expression; bottom: global comparison of the correlation between sensitivity to the NMT inhibitor Compound 4, measured as EC50, and normalised NMT2 expression (the expression data was obtained from Lorio et. al., Cell, 2016, 166(3), 740-754 and a nonparametric Spearman correlation coefficient was used); b.) top: global comparison of the correlation between sensitivity to the NMT inhibitor Compound 3, measured as EC50, and normalised NMT1 expression; bottom: global comparison of the correlation between sensitivity to the NMT inhibitor Compound 3, measured as EC50, and normalised NMT2 expression (the expression data was obtained from Lorio et, al., Cell, 2016, 166(3), 740-754 and a nonparametric Spearman correlation coefficient was used); and c.) top: global comparison of the correlation between sensitivity to the NMT inhibitor Compound 6, measured as EC50, and normalised NMT1 expression; bottom: global comparison of the correlation between sensitivity to the NMT inhibitor Compound 6, measured as EC50, and normalised NMT2 expression (the expression data was obtained from Lorio et. al., Cell, 2016, 166(3), 740-754 and a nonparametric Spearman correlation coefficient was used).</p>mRNAseq Data</p>Looking at the mRNAseq data sets for BL41 and HeLa (FIGS. 24 and 25), in particular the case of BL41, it is observed that the c-MYC gene sets collapse to a much greater extent than in HeLa. This potentially indicates that the c-MYC driven program is particularly disturbed in BL41, a Burkitt's cell line with c-MYC translocations. Thus, the mRNAseq in BL41 indicates an increased breakdown of the MYC transcriptional program upon administration of a NMT inhibitor compound in a c-MYC addicted cancer.</p>FIG. 24 shows the effect of 100 nM Compound 2 for 24 hours on different MYC gene sets (obtained from the Broad Institute: http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp), as measured via mRNAseq in BL41, a Burkitt's lymphoma cell line with c-Myc chromosomal translocation, with a.) the Hallmark_Myc_Targets_V1, b.)
