    " DESCRIPTION </p>Title of Invention: COMBINATION THERAPY INVOLVING BISPECIFIC BINDING AGENTS BINDING TO CLDN18.2 AND CD3 AND ANTLVEGFR2 ANTIBODIES </p>Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally and is expected to be responsible for an estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018 (Bray, F. et al., CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians, 68: 394-424, 2018). In general, once a solid tumor has metastasized, with a few exceptions such as germ cell and some carcinoid tumors, 5-year survival rarely exceeds 25%. The poor prognosis of certain cancers highlights the need for additional treatment approaches. </p>The tight junction molecule claudin 18 (CLDN18) is an integral transmembrane protein (tetraspanin) having four membrane spanning hydrophobic regions and two extracellular loops (loopl embraced by hydrophobic region 1 and hydrophobic region 2; loop2 embraced by hydrophobic regions 3 and 4). CLDN 18 exists in two different splice variants, which are described in mouse and in human (Niimi, Mol. Cell. Biol. 21 :7380-90, 2001). The splice variants (Genbank accession number: splice variant 1 (CLDN18.1): NP_057453, NM_016369, and splice variant 2 (CLDN 18.2): NM_001002026, NP_001002026) have a molecular weight of approximately 27.9 / 27.72 kD. The splice variants CLDN18.1 and CLDN18.2 differ in the N-terminal portion which comprises the first transmembrane (TM) region and loopl, whereas the primary protein sequence of the C-terminus is identical. </p>In normal tissues, there is no detectable expression of CLDN 18.2 with exception of stomach where CLDN 18.2 is expressed exclusively on short-lived differentiated gastric epithelial cells. CLDN18.2 is maintained in the course of malignant transformation and thus frequently displayed on the surface of human gastric cancer cells. Moreover, this pan- tumoral antigen is ectopically activated at significant levels in esophageal, pancreatic and lung adenocarcinomas. The CLDN18.2 protein is also localized in lymph node metastases of gastric cancer adenocarcinomas and in distant metastases especially into the ovary (so-called Krukenberg tumors). </p>The differential expression of claudins such as CLDN 18.2 between cancer and normal cells, their membrane localization and their absence from the vast majority of toxicity relevant nonnal tissues makes these molecules attractive targets for cancer immunotherapy and the use of antibody-based \n\ntherapeutics for targeting CLDN18.2 in cancer therapy promises a high level of therapeutic specificity. </p>The chimeric IgGl antibody IMAB362 (Zolbetuximab (previously named Claudiximab)) which is directed against CLDN18.2 has been developed by Ganymed Pharmaceuticals AG. IMAB362 recognizes the first extracellular domain (ECD1) of CLDN18.",
    "e.g., in the same or in different cells and interact upon or after production to form the bispecific binding agent, e.g., within a cell or outside of a cell. In some embodiments, the polypeptide chains are produced as separate polypeptides, i.e., the first polypeptide chain is produced as one polypeptide, the second polypeptide chain is produced as one polypeptide, the third polypeptide chain is produced as one polypeptide, and the fourth polypeptide chain is produced as one polypeptide, and the polypeptide chains interact to form the bispecific binding agent. Other features and advantages of the instant invention will be apparent from the following detailed description and claims. \n\n</p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </p>Figure 1 depicts the \"Fab2-scFv\" format of the bispecific binding agent described herein which comprises a VH recombinantly fused to one side of a heterodimeric Fc (the first polypeptide chain described herein), a VH recombinantly fused to an scFv fused to the other side of the heterodimeric Fc (the second polypeptide chain described herein), and a LC (third and fourth polypeptide chains described herein) forming Fab domains with the VH of the first polypeptide chain and the additional VH of the second polypeptide chain. </p>Figure 2: Anti-tumor Effect of ASP2138 in Combination with DC101 in a Mouse CLDN18.2- Expressing B16-F10 Tumor-Bearing Human CD3E Knock-in Mouse Model </p>B16-F10_mCLDN18.2 cells were subcutaneously inoculated into the flank of hCD3s KI mice at 2.0 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells on day -4.

Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific tenns used herein have the same meanings as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. </p>In the following, the elements of the present invention will be described. These elements are listed with specific embodiments, however, it should be understood that they may be combined in any manner and in any number to create additional embodiments. The variously described examples and preferred embodiments should not be construed to limit the present invention to only the explicitly described embodiments.

    " wherein the first binding domain is capable of binding to CLDN18.2 and the second binding domain is capable of binding to CD3. </p>The term \"binding domain\" or \"antigen-binding domain\" as used herein refers to any region, moiety, group or domain which interacts with an antigen, hi some embodiments, the term \"binding domain\" or \"antigen-binding domain\" refers to the site of a binding agent described herein, that binds to an antigen and includes the antigen-binding portion of a binding agent. In certain embodiments, the binding domain is or comprises an antibody, antibody fragment, or any other binding protein, or any combination thereof. The binding domain may be comprised of heavy chain and light chain variable domains (VH and VL), each of which includes four conserved framework regions (FR) and three CDRs. The CDRs vary in sequence and determine the specificity to a particular antigen. The VH and VL domains together may form the site that binds, e.g., specifically binds, a particular antigen. A \"binding domain for\" an antigen designates a binding domain, e.g., of a binding agent described herein, which binds to said antigen and preferably specifically binds to said antigen. </p>According to the present invention, an agent such as an antibody is capable of binding to a predetermined target if it has a significant affinity for said predetermined target and binds to said predetermined target in standard assays. \"Affinity\" or \"binding affinity\" is often measured by equilibrium dissociation constant (KD). Preferably, the term \"significant affinity\" refers to the binding to a predetennined target with a dissociation constant (KD) of IO\u2019<sup>5</sup> M or lower, 1(T<sup>6</sup> M or lower, IO\"<sup>7</sup> M or lower, IO\u2019<sup>8</sup> M or lower, IO'<sup>9</sup> M or lower, IO\u2019<sup>10</sup> M or lower, IO\u2019<sup>11</sup> M or lower, or 10\u2019<sup>12</sup> M or lower. </p>An agent is not (substantially) capable of binding to a target if it has no significant affinity for said target and does not bind significantly, in particular does not bind detectably, to said target in standard assays. Preferably, the agent does not detectably bind to said target if present in a concentration of up to 2, preferably 10, more preferably 20, in particular 50 or 100 pg/ml or higher. Preferably, an agent has no significant affinity for a target if it binds to said target with a KD that is at least 10-fold, 100-fold, 10<sup>3</sup>-fold, 10<sup>4</sup>-fold, 10<sup>5</sup>-fold, or 10<sup>6</sup>-fold higher than the KD for binding to the predetennined target to which the agent is capable of binding. For example, if the KD for binding of an agent to the target to which the agent is capable of binding is IO\u2019<sup>7</sup> M, the KD for \n\nbinding to a target for which the agent has no significant affinity would be at least 1 O\u2019<sup>6</sup> M, 1 O\u2019<sup>5</sup> M, 10\"<sup>4</sup> M, 10\u2019<sup>3</sup> M, IO\u2019<sup>2</sup> M, or 10<sup>4</sup> M. </p>A binding agent such as an antibody is specific for a predetermined target if it is capable of binding to said predetermined target while it is not capable of binding to other targets, i.e. has no significant affinity for other targets and does not significantly bind to other targets in standard assays. According to the invention, a binding agent is specific for CLDN18.2 if it is capable of binding to CLDN18.2 but is not (substantially) capable of binding to other targets. Preferably, a binding agent is specific for CLDN18.2 if the affinity for and the binding to such other targets does not significantly exceed the affinity for or binding to CLDN18.2-unrelated proteins such as bovine serum albumin (BSA), casein, human serum albumin (HSA) or non-claudin transmembrane proteins such as MHC molecules or transferrin receptor or any other specified polypeptide. Preferably, a binding agent is specific for a predetermined target if it binds to said target with a KD that is at least 10-fold, 100-fold, 10<sup>3</sup>-fold, 10<sup>4</sup>-fold, 10<sup>5</sup>-fold, or 10<sup>6</sup>-fold lower than the KD for binding to a target for which it is not specific. For example, if the KD for binding of a binding agent to the target for which it is specific is 10\u2019<sup>7</sup> M, the KD for binding to a target for which it is not specific would be at least 10\"<sup>6</sup> M, 10\u2019<sup>5</sup> M, 10\u2019<sup>4</sup> M, 10\"<sup>3</sup> M, 10\"<sup>2</sup> M, or 10\"<sup>1</sup> M. </p>The term \"kd\" (sec<sup>4</sup>), as used herein, refers to the dissociation rate constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction. Said value is also referred to as the koff value. </p>The term \"KD\" (M), as used herein, refers to the dissociation equilibrium constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction. </p>Binding of a binding agent to a target can be determined experimentally using any suitable method; see, for example, Berzofsky et al., \"Antibody-Antigen Interactions\" In Fundamental Immunology, Paul, W. E., Ed., Raven Press New York, N Y (1984), Kuby, Janis Immunology, W. H. Freeman and Company New York, N Y (1992), and methods described herein. Affinities may be readily determined using conventional techniques, such as by equilibrium dialysis; by using the BIAcore 2000 instrument, using general procedures outlined by the manufacturer; by radioimmunoassay using radiolabeled target antigen; or by another method known to the skilled artisan. The affinity data may be analyzed, for example, by the method of Scatchard et al., Ann N.Y. Acad. ScL, 51 :660 (1949). The measured affinity of a particular interaction between binding agent and antigen can vary if measured under different conditions, e.g., salt concentration, pH. \n\nThus, measurements of affinity and other antigen-binding parameters, e.g., KD, IC50, are preferably made with standardized solutions of binding agent and antigen, and a standardized buffer. </p>The term \"competes\" refers to the competition between two binding agents such as antibodies for binding to a target antigen. If two binding agents do not block each other for binding to a target antigen, such binding agents are non-competing and this is an indication that said binding agents do not bind to the same part, i.e. epitope of the target antigen. It is well known to a person skilled in the art how to test for competition of binding agents for binding to a target antigen. An example of such a method is a so-called cross-competition assay, which may e.g. be performed as an ELISA or by flow-cytometry. </p>Two binding agents such as antibodies have the \"same specificity\" if they bind to the same antigen and to the same epitope. Such binding agents would compete for binding in a competition binding assay. In some embodiments, binding agents binding to the same epitope are considered to bind to the same amino acids on the target molecule. That antibodies bind to the same epitope on a target antigen may be determined by standard alanine scanning experiments or antibody-antigen crystallization experiments known to a person skilled in the art. </p>The ability of binding agents to compete for binding to an antigen indicates that these binding agents may bind to the same epitope region of the antigen or when binding to another epitope sterically hinder the binding of binding agents to that particular epitope region. Competing binding agents can be readily identified based on their ability to compete with one or more binding agents in standard binding assays such as Surface Plasmon Resonance analysis, ELISA assays or flow cytometry (see WO 2013/173223). For example, the competition between binding agents can be detected by a cross-blocking assay. For example, a competitive ELISA assay may be performed by coating target antigen on the wells of a microtiter plate and adding antigen-binding agent and candidate competing test binding agent. The amount of the antigen-binding agent bound to the antigen in the well indirectly correlates with the binding ability of the candidate competing test binding agent that competes therewith for binding, e.g., to the same epitope. Specifically, the larger the affinity of the candidate competing test binding agent is for the same epitope,",

GraphPad Prism (ver. 8.0.2; GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) was used for data processing. \n\nRESULTS AND CONCLUSION </p>Anti-tumor effect of ASP2138, a bispecific antibody for claudinl8.2 (CLDN18.2) and CD3, in combination with an anti-mouse vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 antibody (DC 101) and/or paclitaxel (PTX) was investigated in a mouse CLDN18.2-expressing B16-F10 (Bib- Fl O mCLDN 18.2) tumor-bearing human CD3s knock-in (hCD3e KI) mouse model. From 4 days after the inoculation of B 16-F 10_mCLDN 18.2, ASP2138 (0.01 mg/kg) and PTX ( 10 mg/kg) were intraperitoneally administered on days 0 and 7, and DC 101 (200 pg/head) was intraperitoneally administered on days 0, 3, 7 and 10. The tumor growth was inhibited by the administration of ASP2138 or DC101 by 66% or 61% on day 14, respectively. The combination of ASP2138 and DC 101 (combination!) inhibited the tumor growth by 95% on day 14, and no differences in body weight change were observed among the groups (Table 2, Figures 2 and 3). On the other hand, the administration of DC101 and PTX (DC101-PTX) inhibited the tumor growth by 76% on day 14. The combination of ASP2138 and DC101-PTX (combination^) inhibited the tumor growth by 93% on day 14, and no differences in body weight change were observed among the groups (Table 2, Figures 4 and 5). The tumor volumes in the combination! group were significantly smaller than those in the ASP2138-treated group and DClOl-treated group. The tumor volumes in the combination group were significantly smaller than those in the ASP2138-treated group and DC101 -PTX- treated group. This study demonstrated that the combination treatment of ASP2138 and DC101 and/or PTX improved the anti-tumor efficacy compared with monotherapy of ASP2138 or DC101, and the combination therapy of DC101-PTX in B 16-F10_mCLDN18.2 tumor-bearing hCD3s KI mouse model. \n\n</p>Table 2 Percent Inhibition of Tumor Growth after Intraperitoneal Administration of</p>ASP2138, DC101 and/or PTX in a Mouse CLDN18.2-Expressing B16-F10 Tumor-Bearing Human CD3s Knock-in Mouse Model \n<img id=\"imgf000127_0001\" path=\"imgf000127_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/1412727225/WO/20250612/A1/002025/12/14/44/imgf000127_0001.tif\"/>\n </p>B16-F10_mCLDN18.2 cells were subcutaneously inoculated into the flank of hCD3s KI mice at 2.0 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells on day -4. Mice were treated with ASP2138 (0.01 mg/kg) and PTX (10 mg/kg) on days 0 and 7 and DC101 (200 pg/head) on days 0, 3, 7 and 10. Data represent the mean percent inhibition of tumor growth on day 14 in each group (n=15).
