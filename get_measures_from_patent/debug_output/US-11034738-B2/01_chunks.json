    "f the best-characterized and most endothelial cell-selective systems involves the Tie-2 receptor tyrosine kinase that is selectively expressed within the vascular endothelium (referred to as \u201cTie-2\u201d or \u201cTie-2R\u201d (also referred to as \u201cORK\u201d); murine Tie-2 is also referred to as \u201ctek\u201d) and its ligands, the angiopoietins (Yancopoulos, G. D., et al., Nature 407 [2000] 242-48; Gale, N. W. and Yancopoulos, G. D., Genes Dev. 13:1055-1066 [1999]).</p>There are 4 known angiopoietins; angiopoietin-1 (\u201cAng-1,\u201d alternatively abbreviated with ANGPT1 or Ang1) through angiopoietin-4 (\u201cAng-4\u201d). These angiopoietins are also referred to as \u201cTie-2 ligands\u201d (Davis, S., et al., Cell, \u00a7 7:1161-1169 [1996]; Grosios, K., et al, Cytogenet Cell Genet, \u00a7 4:118-120 [1999]; Holash, J., et al, Investigative Ophthalmology &amp; Visual Science, 42:1611-1625 [1999]; Koblizek, T.

C., et al., Science 277 (1997) 55-60). Whereas Ang-1 binding to Tie-2 stimulates receptor phosphorylation in cultured endothelial cells, Ang-2 has been observed to both agonize and antagonize Tie-2 receptor phosphorylation (Davis, S., et al, [1996], supra; Maisonpierre, P. C., et al, [1997], supra; Kim, I, J. H. Kim, et al, Oncogene 19(39): 4549-4552 (2000); Teichert-Kuliszewska, K., P. C. Maisonpierre, et al, Cardiovascular Research 49(3): 659-70 (2001)). The phenotypes of mouse Tie-2 and Ang-1 knockouts are similar and suggest that Ang-1-stimulated Tie-2 phosphorylation mediates remodeling and stabilization of developing vessels in utero through maintenance of endothelial cell-support cell adhesion (Dumont, D. J., et al, Genes &amp; Development, 8:1897-1909 [1994]; Sato, T. N., et al, Nature, 376:10-14 [1995]; Suri, C, et al, [1996], supra). The role of Ang-1 in vessel stabilization is thought to be conserved in the adult, where it is expressed widely and constitutively (Hanahan, D., Science, 277:48-50 [1997]; Zagzag, D., et al, Experimental Neurology, 59:391-400 [1999]). In contrast, Ang-2 expression is primarily limited to sites of vascular remodeling, where it is thought to block Ang-1 function, thereby inducing a state of vascular plasticity conducive to angiogenesis (Hanahan, D., [1997], supra; Holash, J., et al, Science, 284:1994-1998 [1999]; Maisonpierre, P.

Such methods include, but are not limited to, fluorescence titration, direct ELISA, competition ELISA, calorimetric methods, such as isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore). Such methods are well established in the art and examples thereof are also detailed below.</p>It is also noted that the complex formation between the respective binder and its ligand is influenced by many different factors such as the concentrations of the respective binding partners, the presence of competitors, pH and the ionic strength of the buffer system used, and the experimental method used for determination of the dissociation constant K<sub>D </sub>(for example fluorescence titration, direct ELISA, competition ELISA or surface plasmon resonance, just to name a few) or even the mathematical algorithm which is used for evaluation of the experimental data.</p>Therefore, it is also clear to the skilled person that the K<sub>D </sub>values (dissociation constant of the complex formed between the respective binder and its target/ligand) may vary within a certain experimental range, depending on the method and experimental setup that is used for determining the affinity of a particular mutein for a given ligand. This means that there may be a slight deviation in the measured KD values or a tolerance range depending, for example, on whether the K<sub>D </sub>value was determined by surface plasmon resonance (Biacore), by competition ELISA, or by \u201cdirect ELISA.\u201d</p>As used herein, a compound such as a mutein of the disclosure \u201cspecifically binds\u201d a target (for example, Ang-1 or Ang-2) or has \u201cbinding specificity\u201d for a target if it is able to discriminate between that target and one or more reference targets, since binding specificity is not an absolute, but a relative property. \u201cSpecific binding\u201d can be determined, for example, in accordance with Western blots, ELISA-, RIA-, ECL-, IRMA-tests, IHC and peptide scans.</p>The term \u201chuman lipocalin 2\u201d or \u201chuman Lcn 2\u201d or \u201chuman NGAL\u201d or \u201chNGAL\u201d as used herein refers to the mature human neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) with the SWISS-PROT/UniProt Data Bank Accession Number P80188.

In this experiment, a constant concentration of human Ang-2 was incubated with variable concentrations of lipocalin muteins for 1 h.

After 1 h incubation at room temperature. 20 \u03bcl of the reaction mixture was transferred to the hTie-2 Fc-coated plate to capture unbound (free) or non-competitively bound hAng-2 for 20 min at RT.

Muteins selected for binding to Ang-2 and negative control (SEQ ID NO: 16) were biotinylated for 2 h at room temperature applying an appropriate excess of EZ-Link NHS-PEG4-Biotin (Thermo). Biotinylated samples were purified from non-reacted Biotin using a Zeba Spin Desalting Plate (Thermo) according to the manufactures instructions.</p>In the SPR affinity assay, biotinylated muteins and negative control were captured on a sensor chip CAP using the Biotin CAPture Kit (GE Healthcare): Sensor Chip CAP is pre-immobilized with an ssDNA oligo. Undiluted Biotin CAPture Reagent (streptavidin conjugated with the complementary ss-DNA oligo) was applied at a flow rate of 2 \u03bcl/min for 300 s.

The anti-lipocalin-mutein antibody had been obtained by immunization of rabbits with a mixture of lipocalin muteins, and was subsequently coupled to HRP using a kit (EZ-link Plus Activated Peroxidase, Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions, to obtain the antibody-HRP conjugate. After washing, 20 \u03bcl fluorogenic HRP substrate (Quantablue, Pierce) was added to each well, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 60 minutes. The fluorescence intensity of every well on the plate was read using a Genios Plus Microplate reader (Tecan). To evaluate the data, free muteins concentration, c(Mutein)<sub>free</sub>, was calculated based on the standard curve results, and plotted versus ligand concentration, c(Ligand). To obtain the ligand concentration at which formation of the hAng-2/Mutein complex was blocked by 50% (IC50), the curves were fitted by nonlinear regression with a single-sites binding model according to c(Mutein)<sub>free</sub>=c(Mutein)<sub>tot</sub>/(1+c(Ligand)/IC50)), with the total tracer concentration c(Mutein)<sub>tot </sub>and the IC50 value as free parameters. Curve fitting was performed using GraphPad Prism 4 software. Said curve fitting yielded the results that are summarized in the following Table 4.</p>TABLE 4Solution bindinIC58: nMg ELISAhAng-1hAng-2mAng-2hAng-4mAng-3hVEGF-ASEQ ID NO: 17/18260.60.07N/AN/AN/ASEQ ID NO: 3N/A1.41.8N/AN/AN/ASEQ ID NO: 1&gt;1002.50.65N/AN/AN/ASEQ ID NO: 110.890.490.05N/AN/AN/ASEQ ID NO: 89.30.50.08N/AN/AN/ASEQ ID NO: 70.470.410.05N/AN/AN/ASEQ ID NO: 91.90.760.11N/AN/AN/A</p>As depicted in FIG. 2, the data demonstrates that SEQ ID NO: 8 displayed high affinity towards human and mouse Ang-2 and SEQ ID NO: 7 displayed high affinity not only towards human and mouse Ang-2 but also towards human Ang-1.</p>Example 8: Lipocalin Muteins Blocking the Binding of Human and Mouse Ang-2 to hTie-2 Expressing CellsWhether lipocalin muteins binds to human Ang-2 and mouse Ang-2 in a competitive mode was tested on hTie-2 overexpressing HEK cells using a competition cell electrochemoluminescence (ECL) assay format (see FIGS. 3 and 4). In this experiment, a constant concentration of human Ang-2 and mouse Ang-2 was incubated with variable concentrations of lipocalin muteins (SEQ ID NOs: 1, 3, 6-14) and benchmark antibody (SEQ ID NOs: 19/20) for 1 h. After this pre-incubation in solution, an aliquot of the lipocalin mutein/Ang-2 mixture was transferred to an MSD plate coated with hTie-2 overexpressing HEK cells to measure the concentration of hAng-2 or mAng-2 that was not blocked to bind to"
