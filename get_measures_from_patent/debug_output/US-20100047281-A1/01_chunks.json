Using this model mutations were located at rtA194T.</p>The HBV reverse transcriptase mutation rtA194T is located away from the active site towards the end of the alpha helix in a potential hinge region which contains the B domain (FIG. 15).</p>Two potential mechanisms by which the mutation at rtA194T may influence resistance to TDF and/or LMV.\n1. The mutation at rtA194T in the hinge region may still have the ability to affect the position alpha helix that encodes the B domain. This is where codon rt180 is located, and this region has the potential to interact with the DNA template. Changes to this region may alter the position of the DNA template strand relative to the dNTP binding site.2. The reverse transcriptase (rt) region is only part of the polymerase protein. The entire HBV polymerase is a large protein (90 kd). The mutation is on the external surface of the rt region. There is no structural homologues for the terminal protein and spacer region components of the HBV polymerase protein that also includes an RNase H component. Therefore, the mutation has the potential to interact with the rest of components the polymerase protein. This has been demonstrated in HIV in which mutations which affect the RNAse H component have been known to also alter antiviral sensitivity.\n</p>Example 7TDFTDF is a potent inhibitor of HBV replication. TDF has activity against hepadnaviruses and HIV. The structure of TDF is shown in FIG. 16 and its synthesis is described in a review by Grim S A, Romanelli F, Ann Pharmacother 37(6):849-59, 2003. Preclinical studies indicate that TDF is a highly potent inhibitor of HBV in enzyme- and cell-based assays</p>Example 8Replication Competent HBV PlasmidsAn extended (1.28\u00d7) HBV genome was cloned (HBV genotype A, subtype adw2) into a pBluescript KS(+) plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif., USA), as described by Tacke et al, J Virol 78:8524-8535, 2004.</p>Example 9Site-Directed MutagenesisThree mutated HBV plasmids were constructed using a Quikchange (Registered) II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif., USA). Plasmids contained either mutations rtL180M and rtM204V (LM), rtL180M, rtM204V and rtA194T (LMAT), or rtA194T (AT).
