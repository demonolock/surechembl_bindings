{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\nRintatolimod had an EC50 of 0.4 pg/ml, while 50 pg/ml is achievable in human serum at dosages of 400 mg, which is utilized clinically (Strayer 2012).\nComplete inhibition to below detectable levels was seen with Rintatolimod at 10 mg/kg which is equivalent to 700 mg (in an average weight human (70 kg)) and has also been shown to be a generally well-tolerated dosage level (Thompson 1996).\nOnly Rintatolimod at a dosage of 10 mg/kg/day obtained a 100% survival rate.\nRibavirin required a human dosage equivalent of 4,500 mg/day, which is over three times greater than the highest recommended dose of 1,200 mg/day in order to obtain a 30% survival rate.\nRintatolimod demonstrated both prophylactic and therapeutic activity with increased survival at dosage levels (10 pg/dose) that are clinically achievable in humans."}
