    "s are also in the sequence listing section. Therefore, one can detect SARS-CoV-2 by collecting tissue samples from a subject and performing PCR or RT-PCR using primers. </p>Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 titer may involve determining the level (e.g., concentration, amount) of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in a sample. Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 infection (SARS- CoV-2 infection) status may involve collecting tissue samples such as lung, nasal, blood, oral samples, or body fluid from a subject and performing a test such as PCR or RT-PCR using PCR primers (e.g., from the sequence listing section of this disclosure). </p>Example 3: _ TdsRNA Activity Against SARS-CoV tdsRNA (Rintatolimod) has in vivo antiviral activity against the pathogenesis of SARS- CoV which has highly lethal effects in humans as well as in BALB/c mice. This mouse model largely mimics the human disease and causes a lethal pulmonary syndrome in 5-6 week old BALB/c mice. TdsRNA at 10 mg/kg/day produced complete protection against death (10/10 mice survived compared to 0/10 mice surviving in the saline control group). TdsRNA also significantly reduced lung scores and weight loss (p&lt;0.05). </p>Table 3 summarizes the findings of nine published studies of the activity of Rintatolimod, poly ICLC, and Ribavirin in SARS models. In addition, one recombinant human hybrid interferon (Interferon B/D) which is active in mice is also included. Individual in vitro drug \n\n activity data available from each publication is presented in terms of IC50 (50% Inhibitory Concentration) and EC50 (50% Effective Concentration) as represented by the respective authors, and is based on achievable drug serum levels relative to IC50 or EC50 drug concentrations. To be considered active against SARS at clinically achievable serum levels, the maximum achievable concentration (Cmax) in humans had to be higher than the IC50 or EC50. </p>In two studies (Barnard 2006 and Day 2009), SARS mouse models were evaluated and the drugs utilized in these studies had to yield their clinical effect, i.e., reduction of SARS virus lung titers below the level of detection (Barnard 2006) or increased survival (Day 2009) at clinically achievable/tolerated human dosage levels in order to be considered active. Only one drug, Rintatolimod, was active at clinically achievable serum/dosage levels. Barnard (2003) studied the inhibition of human CoV strain OC43 cytopathic effect (CPE) using Rintatolimod, poly ICLC, and Ribavirin. Rintatolimod had an EC50 of 0.4 pg/ml, while 50 pg/ml is achievable in human serum at dosages of 400 mg, which is utilized clinically (Strayer 2012). Barnard (2006) studied the ability of Rintatolimod and rIFN-aB/D to inhibit SARS virus (Urbani Strain) titers in the lungs of B ALB/c mice. Complete inhibition to below detectable levels was seen with Rintatolimod at 10 mg/kg which is equivalent to 700 mg (in an average weight human (70 kg)) and has also been shown to be a generally well-tolerated dosage level (Thompson 1996). The rIFN-a B/D inhibited virus titers to below detectable level, but required a dose of 100,000 IU in mice, which is equivalent to an extremely high human dose of 500 x 10<sup>6</sup> IU, and furthermore is not clinically available. Day (2009) studied a new mouse adapted strain of SARS-CoV as a lethal model. Only Rintatolimod at a dosage of 10 mg/kg/day obtained a 100% survival rate. In contrast, Ribavirin required a human dosage equivalent of 4,500 mg/day, which is over three times greater than the highest recommended dose of 1,200 mg/day in order to obtain a 30% survival rate. Ribavirin was studied in six other publications and was uniformly not active at clinically achievable serum concentrations (3.7 pg/ml). </p>Finally, Lee (1983) studied the activity of Rintatolimod against the mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV). Rintatolimod demonstrated both prophylactic and therapeutic activity with increased survival at dosage levels (10 pg/dose) that are clinically achievable in hum"
