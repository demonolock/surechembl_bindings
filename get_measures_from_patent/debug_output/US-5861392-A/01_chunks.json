    "nventional procedure. An aldehyde of formula IV may be converted into the corresponding amine of formula III employing a procedure similar to that described in Example 3, parts a)-e). Using a procedure similar to that described in Example 1, an aldehyde of formula IV may be converted into a piperidone of formula VII; and an amine of formula III may be obtained by reductive alkylation of an amine of formula HM-L-NH<sub>2</sub> using the piperidone of formula VII and an analogous procedure to one described in Example 1.h) or Example 3, parts a)-e).</p>For the preparation of a starting material piperidine of formula II, a 1-protected 4-piperidone may be used for a reductive alkylation, followed by a cyclization similar to that described above in procedure (b), and finally deprotection, for example as described in Example 1, parts h)-j). Generally, a starting material piperidine of formula II may be obtained from a 1-protected 4-aminopiperidine or a 1-protected 4-piperidone using conventional synthetic methodology.</p>As will be clear to one skilled in the art, a variety of sequences is available for preparation of the starting materials, and the sequences leading to the starting materials and products of the invention may be altered if appropriate considerations regarding the synthetic methods and radicals present are followed.</p>The utility of a Compound may be demonstrated by standard tests and clinical studies, including those described below.</p>Neurokinin A (NKA) Receptor-binding Assay (Test A)The ability of a Compound to antagonize the binding of NKA at the NK2 receptor may be demonstrated using an assay using the human NK2 receptor expressed in Mouse Erythroleukemia (MEL) cells by using MEL cell membranes (MELM) which bear high-affinity and selective NK2 receptors and which is carried out as follows.</p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURESFIG. 1 shows construction of the MEL cell expression vector construct pMEG3/hNK2R.</p>FIG. 2 shows construction of the expression vector construct GSE1417/hNK2R.</p>FIG. 3 shows expression of human NK2 receptor in MEL C88 cells.</p>MEL Cell Expression of Human NK2 Receptor (hNK2R)Heterologous protein expression in Mouse Erythroleukemia (MEL) cells uses the human globin locus control region (LCR) (F. Grosveld et al., Cell (1987) 51, 975-985). The cDNAs are inserted between the human beta-globin promoter and the second intron of the human beta-globin gene, and this expression cassette is then placed downstream of the LCR and transfected into MEL cells (M. Needham et al., Nucl. Acids Res. (1992) 20, 997-1003). Human NK2 receptor cDNA (A. Graham et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. (1991) 177, 8-16) was isolated from human lung RNA by polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequenced. Human NK2 receptor cDNA was subcloned into a shuttle vector (pMEG3) containing the beta-globin promoter and the 3' portion of the human beta-globin gene (FIG. 1). Human NK2 receptor cDNA was restricted with Eco 0109 (5' end) and Bam HI (3",
    " at the highest level (both hNK2R mRNA and specific NKA binding). This clone was scaled up and is now routinely fermented at 20 litre scale per month and supplied for use in Test A.</p>Membrane preparations (MELM) prepared from the MEL cells containing high-affinity NK2 receptors were prepared according to a published protocol (D. Aharony, et al., Neuropeptides (1992) 23, 121-130) with the following minor modifications: (1) Iodoacetamide (1 mM) was included in the homogenization buffer; (2) Homogenization was as published but for a shorter period of 10 seconds once and at a slower speed (setting 10); and (3) The equilibration step with KCl/EDTA was not performed. In a typical preparation, binding of <sup>3</sup> H-NKA (2.5 nM) to MELM was highly specific (88\u00b14%) and linearly dependent on the protein concentration, with significant binding detected as low as 26 \u03bcg protein/mL. Equilibrium-competion experiments demonstated binding to high-affinity, high-density receptors with K<sub>D</sub> =1187 nM, B<sub>max</sub> =2229 fmol/mg protein.</p>The radio ligand 3H-neurokinin A (<sup>3</sup> H-NKA) as  4,5-<sup>3</sup> H-Leu<sup>9</sup> !--NKA (typical specific activity, 117 Ci/mmol) is obtained by custom synthesis from Cambridge Research Biochemicals and is &gt;95% pure. Repeated HPLC analysis demonstrated that the ligand is stable under proper storage conditions (silanized vials with 0.2% mercaptoethanol, under argon). Also, no degradation or metabolism is apparent in the receptor-binding assay.</p>The assay is carried out using an incubation buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM Mg<sup>++</sup>, 100 \u03bcM thiorphan, 1 nM <sup>3</sup> H-NKA, 0.02% (w:v) BSA, 30 mM K<sup>+</sup>, and 300 \u03bcM dithiothreitol; and the concentration of membrane protein is held at approximately 0.05-0.025 mg per tube. Nonspecific binding is routinely defined with 1 \u03bcM NKA. Each tube receives the following: 150 \u03bcL incubation buffer, 20 \u03bcL <sup>3</sup> H-NKA, 20 \u03bcL Compound, NKA or buffer as appropriate, and 125 \u03bcL membrane suspension. The reaction is initiated by the addition of the membranes. The tubes are incubated for 60 min at 25\u00b0 C. in a shaking water bath. The reaction is terminated by washing the tubes with 10 mL of ice-cold 50 mM Tris HCl using a Brandel cell harvesting system using Whatman GF/B filters which have been soaked at least 4 hours at room temperature in 0.01% (w:v) polyethylenimine to collect the membranes. The filters are deposited in scintillation vials and read in a Beckman LS 6000LL Scintillation Counter. The binding constant K<sub>i</sub> is calculated by standard methods and is typically the mean of several such determinations. The K<sub>i</sub> values may be converted to negative logarithms and expressed as -log molar K<sub>i</sub> (i.e. pK<sub>i</sub>).</p>In an initial use of this assay, the IC<sub>50</sub> measured for the standard compound L-659,877 was found to be 30 nM versus <sup>3</sup> H-NKA binding to MELM. The selectivity of a Compound for binding at the NK2 receptor may be shown by determining its binding at other receptors using standard assays, for example, one using a tritiated derivative of SP in a tissue preparation selective for NK1 receptors or one using a tritiated derivative of NKB in a tissue preparation selective for NK3 receptors.</p>Guinea Pig Assay (Test B)In the test described below either NKA or  \u03b2-Ala<sup>8</sup> !-NKA(4-10) is used as an agonist. The chosen agonist is refered to as AG throughout the description. The ability of a Compound to antagonize the action of AG in a pulmonary tissue may be demonstrated using a functional assay in guinea pig trachea, which is carried out as follows.</p>Male guinea pigs are killed by a sharp blow to the back of the head. The trachea are removed, trimmed of excess tissue and divided into two segments. Each segment is suspended as a ring between stainless steel stirrups in water-jacketed (37.5\u00b0 C.) tissue baths containing a physiological salt solution of the following composition (mM): NaCl, 119; KCl 4.6; CaCl<s"
