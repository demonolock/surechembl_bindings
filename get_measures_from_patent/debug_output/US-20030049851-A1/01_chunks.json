    "flammatory condition. </p>[0012] The invention is further directed to a method for diagnosing and treating patients with haemostaic dysfunction, comprising adding a reagent to a test sample that causes precipitate formation without causing fibrin polymerization, taking measurements over time of a parameter of the test sample that changes due to the formation of the precipitate, determining the rate of change of said parameter, determining that a patient has haemostatic dysfunction if said rate of change is beyond a predetermined limit; intervening with treatment for said haemostatic dysfunction if said rate of change is beyond the predetermined limit. </p>[0013] The invention also is directed to a method comprising adding a reagent to a patient sample capable of causing formation of a precipitate in said sample, monitoring a changing parameter of said sample over time, said parameter indicative of said precipitate formation, determining the rate of change of said parameter or whether said parameter exceeds a predetermined limit at a predetermined time, repeating the above steps at least once, each time at a different plasma/reagent ratios, measuring the maximum, average and/or standard deviation for the measurements; and determining haemostatic dysfunction based on the maximum, average and/or standard deviation measurements. </p>[0014] The present invention is further directed to an immunoassay comprising providing a ligand capable of binding to C-reactive protein or the 300 kD protein in lane 5 of FIG. 21, adding said ligand to a test sample from a patient and allowing binding of said ligand to C-reactive protein or said 300 kD protein in said test sample, detecting the presence and or amount of C-reactive protein or said 300 kD protein in said sample, and diagnosing haemostatic dysfunction in the patient due to the detection and/or amount of C-reactive protein or said 300 kD protein detected. </p>[0015] The invention further relates to a method for testing the efficacy of a new drug on a human or animal subject with an inflammatory condition and/or haemostatic dysfunction, comprising adding a reagent to a patient test sample, said reagent capable of causing precipitate formation in some subject test samples without causing fibrin polymerization, measuring a parameter of said test sample over time which is indicative of said precipitate formation, determining the slope of said changing parameter and/or the value of said parameter at a predetermined time, administering a drug to said animal or human subject, repeating the above steps at a later date or time, wherein an increase or decrease in said slope or value at said later date or time is indicative of the efficacy of said drug.</p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0016]FIGS. 1a and 1b illustrate transmittance waveforms on the APTT assay with FIG. 1a showing a normal appearance, and 1b showing a biphasic appearance; </p>[0017]FIG. 2 illustrates transmittance levels at 25 seconds in relation to diagnosis in 54 patients with bi-phasic waveform abnormalities. The horizontal dotted line represents the normal transmittance level; </p>[0018]FIG. 2 illustrates transmittance levels (upper panel) and waveforms (lower panel) on a patient who developed DIC following sepsis and recovered; </p>[0019]FIG. 4 illustrates serial transmittance levels (upper panel) and waveforms (lower panel) on a patient who ",
    "nt's plasma were as follows: PPACK (10 \u03bcM) was added to patient plasma. Calcium chloride was added to 50 mM, followed by 8 minutes of incubation, followed b the addition of EtOH to 5%. The sample was then centrifuged 10,500\u00d7g for 15 inutes at 4 degrees Celsius. The pellet was then dissolved in HBS/1 mM citrate/10 \u03bcM PPACK, followed by 35-70% (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>fractionation. Finally, sepharose chromatography was performed using a 5 ml bed, 0.02-0.5M NaCl gradient and 50 ml/side, to collect 2 ml fractions. FIG. 20 shows the results of anion exchange chromatography (Q-sepharose) of material recovery after the 35-70% ammonium sulfate fractionation of patient plasma. </p>[0072]FIGS. 21a and 21b show the non-reduced and reduced, respectively, SDS PAGE of various fractions obtained upon fractionation of patient plasma. The loading orientation (left to right): 5-15% gradient/Neville Gel. (approximately 10 \u03bcg protein loaded per well). In lane 1 are molecular weight standard (94, 67, 45, 30, 20 and 14 kDa from top to bottom. In lane 2 is 35% (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>pellet, whereas in lane 3 is 70% (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>supernate. Lane 4 is Q-sepharose starting material. Also shown in FIGS. 21a and b are (from FIG. 20) peaks 1, 2a, 2b and 3 in, respectively, lanes 5, 6, 7 and 8. Lane 9 is pellet 1, whereas in lane 10 are again, molecular weight standards. Results of NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal sequencing showed peak 3, the 22 kD protein in lanes 8 and 9 to be C-reactive protein (CRP), and the 10 kD protein in lane 9 to be human serum amyloid A (SAA). Peak 1 in lane 5 is a 300 kD protein which, as can be seen in FIG. 23, is part of the complex of proteins (along with CRP) in the precipitate formed due to the addition of a metal divalent cation to a plasma sample. </p>[0073] Immunoblots of CRP were performed in normal and DIC plasma. Blot 1 (see FIG. 22): (used 0.2 \u03bcl plasmas for reducing SDS-PAGE/CRP Immunoblotting). Loading orientation (left to right): NHP; Pt 5; 3; 1; 2; 4; and 8. For Blot 2: Loading orientation (left to right): NHP; Pt 9; 10; 11; 7; 6; 12. For Blot 3: (CRP purified from DIC patient plasma)\u2014Loading orientation (left to right; ng CRP loaded): 3.91; 7.81; 15.625; 31.25; 62.5; 125; 250. The Blots were blocked with 2% (w/v) BSA in PBS, pH 7.4 and then sequentially probed with rabbit anti-human CRP-IgG (Sigma, Cat# C3527, dil 1:5000 in PBS/0.01% Tween 20) and then treated with the same antibody conjugated to HRP (dil 1:25000 in PBS/0.01% Tween 20). </p>[0074]FIG. 23 illustrates the turbidity changes upon adding divalent calcium to materials obtained upon Q-sepharose chromatography in the absence of plasma. No single peak gave a positive response, but a mixture of peak 1 and peak 3 materials did give a positive response indicating the involvement of CRP, a 300 kD protein, and one or more other proteins in the precipitate (peak 3+plasma was the control). FIG. 24 is a table showing CRP, \u03bcg/ml determined by ELISA. Delta A405 nm is the maximum turbidity change observed when patients' plasma was recalcified on the presence of the thrombin inhibitor PPACK). FIG. 24, therefore, shows that patients with increased absorbance have varying elevated levels of CRP, once again indicating that more than one protein is involved in the precipitate formation. </p>[0075] In one embodiment of the invention, the reagent to plasma ratio is varied between multiple tests using a reagent that induces precipitate formation. This variance allows for amplifying the detection of the precipitate formation by optimization of reagent to plasma ratio (e.g. varying plasma or reagent concentrations). In the alternative, the slope due to the precipitate formation can be averaged between the multiple tests. As can be seen in FIG. 25, the response to increasing calcium concentrations is shown in optical transmission waveform profiles. The left panels show two normal patients where calcium concentrations were varied (no clotting agents used), whereas the right panels show two patients with haemostatic dysfuntion (DIC in these two cases) where the metal cation (calcium) concentration was varied (the calcium alone being incapable of any substantial fibrin polymerization). </p>[0076] Though precipitate formation is capable of being detected in patients with haemostatic dys",
    "ficial that the reagent used is capable of forming the precipitate without fibrin polymerization. As can be seen in FIG. 26, the slope is more pronounced and more easily detectable when a reagent such as calcium chloride is used (right panel) as compared to when a clotting reagent such as an APTT reagent (left panel) is used. As can be seen in FIG. 27, when a clot inhibitor was added (in this case heparin), all parameters including slope_1 gave good results, and slope_1 showed the best sensitivity. For the above reasons, a reagent capable of precipitate formation in the absence of fibrin polymerization and/or a clot inhibitor are preferred. </p>[0077] As can be seen in FIG. 28, CRP levels from 56 ITU patients were plotted against transmittance at 18 seconds. The dotted line is the cut-off for an abnormal transmittance at 18 seconds. FIG. 29 shows more samples with CRP and decrease in transmittance at 18 seconds (10000-TR18). These figures indicate that patients with abnormal transmittance levels due to precipitate formation all have increased levels of CRP. However, not all patients with increased levels of CRP have abnormal transmittance levels thus indicating that more than CRP is involved in the precipitate. </p>[0078] In a further embodiment of the invention, the formation of the precipitate comprising a complex of proteins including CRP is detected and/or quantitated, by the use of a latex agglutination assay. In this method, antibodies are raised against wither the 300 kD protein or CRP. Whether monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies are used, they are bound to suitable latex and reacted with a patient test sample or preferably with the precipitate itself having been separated from the rest of the patient plasma, in accordance with known methods. The amount of agglutination of the latex is proportional to the amount of the CRP complex in the sample. </p>[0079] Alternatively, immunoassays can be performed, such as ELISA's, according to known methods (sandwich, competition or other ELISA) in which the existence and/or amount of the complex of proteins is determined. For example, an antibody bound to solid phase binds to CRP in the CRP protein complex. Then, a second labeled antibody is added which also binds to CRP in the CRP protein complex, thus detecting the complex of proteins. In the alternative, the second labeled antibody can be specific for the 300 kD protein in the complex. Or, in a different assay, the antibody bound to solid phase can bind to the 300 kD protein in the complex, with the second (labeled) antibody binding either to the 300 kD protein or to CRP. Such immunoassays could likewise be adapted to be specific for SAA, where antibodies, bound and labeled, bind to SAA, or where one antibody binds to SAA and the other either to CRP or the 300 kD protein. The above techniques are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art and are outlined in Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Harlow, Ed and Lane, David, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 1988, the subject matter of which is incorporated herein by reference. </p>[0080] It is to be understood that the invention described and illustrated herein is to be taken as a preferred example of the same, and that various changes in the methods of the invention may be resorted to, without departing from the spirit of the invention or scope of the claims. </p>"
