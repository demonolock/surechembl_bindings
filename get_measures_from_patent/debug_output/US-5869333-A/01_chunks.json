    "d by a combination of IgE with a specific allergen. Through them, the effects of an allergen are manifested. Such effects may be systematic or local in nature, depending on the route by which the antigen entered the body and the pattern of deposition of IgE on mast cells or basophils. Local manifestations generally occur in epithelial surfaces at the location at which the allergen entered the body. Systemic effects can include anaphylaxis (anaphylactic shock), which is the result of an IgE-basophil response to circulating (intravascular) antigen.</p>Allergens constitute the most abundant proteins of grass pollen, which is the major cause of allergic disease in temperate climates (Marsh (1975) Allergens and the genetics of allergy; in M. Sela (ed), The Antigens, Vol. 3, pp 271-359, Academic Press Inc., London, N.Y.)., Hill et al. (1979) Medical Journal of Australia 1, 426-429). The first descriptions of the allergenic proteins in ryegrass showed that they are immunochemically distinct, and are known as groups I, II, III and IV (Johnson and March (1965) Nature, 206, 935-; and Johnson and Marsh (1966) Immunochemistry 3, 91-100). Using the International Union of Immunological Societies' (IUIS) nomenclature, these allergens are designated Lol p Ib, Lol p II, Lol p III and Lol p IV. However, the allergenic spectrum of ryegrass pollen is now known to be more complex. The international reference preparation for ryegrass contains 17 allergens ranging in molecular weight from 12 to 89 kD (Stewart et al. (1988) Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 86: 9-18). These allergenic proteins in pollen have been detected by their ability to bind IgE, the immunoglobulin specifically present in allergic individuals.</p>Among these allergens, Lol p I, II, III and IV have been extensively studied. The full amino acid sequences of Lol pII and III have been reported. This is made possible by using standard biochemical techniques due to the high amount of allergenic proteins in the pollen and the relatively small molecular weight of the proteins. Although the proteins of Lol p I and IV are abundant in the pollen, only partial amino acid sequences had been reported using the same techniques. This is due to the relatively high molecular weight of the proteins. In addition, it is difficult to purify allergens without any cross-contamination and is labor-intensive. Lack of primary sequence and highly purified allergens in sufficient quantity have been the limiting factor in the development of both therapeutic and diagnostic products for the treatment and diagnosis of type I allergies.</p>Lol p I is defined as an allergen because of its ability to bind to specific IgE in sera of ryegrass-sensitive patients, to act as an antigen in IgG responses and to trigger T-cell responses. The allergenic properties have been assessed by direct skin testing of grass pollen-sensitive patients. The results showed that 84% had a skin sensitivity to Lol pI (Freidhoff et al., (1986) J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 78: 1190-1201), demonstrating the primary importance of this protein as the major allergen. Furthermore, 95% of patients demonstrated to be grass pollen-sensitive possessed specific IgE antibody that bound to Lol pI, as demonstrated by immunoblotting (Ford and Baldo (1986) International Archives of Allergy and Applied Immunology 81: 193-203).</p>Substantial allergenic cross-reactivity between grass pollens has been demonstrated using an IgE-binding assay, the radioallergo-sorbent test (RAST), for example, as described by Marsh et al. (1970) J. Allergy, 46, 107-121, and Lowenstein (1978) Prog. Allergy, 25, 1-62. (Karger, Basel).</p>The immunochemical relationship of Lol p I with other grass pollen antigens have been demonstrated using both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies (e.g. Smart and Knox (1979) International Archives of Allergy and Applied Immunology 62: 173-187; Singh and Knox (1985) International Archives of Allergy and Applied Immunology 78, 300-304). Antibodies have been prepared to both purified proteins and IgE-binding components. These data demonstrate that the major allergen present in pollen of closely related grasses is immunochemically similar to Lol p I (Singh and Knox, supra).</p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIn accordance with the present invention, it has been discovered that the ryegrass pollen allergen Lol pI comprises two proteins, designated as herein Lol p Ia and Lol p Ib. The Lol p Ib ryegrass pollen allergen is present in L. perenne as a family of proteins. The genes encoding two family members of Lol p Ib, designated Lol p Ib.1 and Lol p Ib.2 have now been identified. Family member Lol p Ib.1 was previously designated Lol p Ib and is now referred to as Lol p Ib.1. As used herein, Lol p Ib thus refers to a major ryegrass pollen protein allergen which is actually a family of closely related proteins having similar structure and function but encoded by separate genes. Therefore, the terms L",

FIG. 22(a) shows the IgE binding from 16 positive sera from a total of 50 ryegrass pollen allergic patients (RAST\u22674). FIG. 22(b) shows monoclonal or polyclonal antibody binding. The values are arbitrary densitometric units of the intensity of the dot blot, measured by Pharmacia LKB UltraScan XL, Sweden. Densitometric values \u2267 were considered as positive binding in comparison to the background. For every peptide the sera and antibody values have been added (score/peptide) and divided by the number of positive sera or antibody to express the final value as an average (score/sera or antibody). Sera C1 and C2 were used as negative controls. C refers to crude ryegrass pollen extract (1 \u03bcg/dot) as positive control.</p>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONThe data herein show that what was considered to be the major allergen of rye-grass pollen, Lol p I, actually comprises at least two different allergenic proteins: Lol p Ia, which comprises 4 different isoforms in the 35 kD range with pIs ranging from about 5.5-7.0 and Lol p Ib, which comprises at least 5 different isoforms of 31/33 kD proteins, and pIs ranging from 6.0-10.6. Lol p Ib has a different primary structure and composition from Lol p Ia, as deduced from NH<sub>2</sub> -terminal amino acid sequence and the absence of allergenic cross-reactivity. cDNA clones encoding Lol p Ib.1 (clone 12R) (SEQ ID NO:1), deposited with American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Rockville, Md. 20852 on Oct. 21, 1993 in the form of a plasmid in E. coli and assigned ATCC Deposit Number 69475, and Lol p Ib.2 (clone 19R) (SEQ ID NO:3) have been isolated and characterized. The Lol p Ib protein encoded by clones 12R and 19R have a different primary structure and composition from Lol p Ia, as deduced by cDNA cloning and the absence of allergenic cross-reactivity. The NH<sub>2</sub> -terminal sequence of recombinant Lol p Ib.1 is identical to that determined for purified native Lol p Ib. However, Lol p Ib.1 and Lol p Ib.2 are apparently acidic proteins, having a predicted pI of 5.16 and 5.9, respectively. Purified native Lol p Ib, Lol p Ib.1 and Lol p Ib.2 are non-glycosylated proteins with similar molecular weights (31/33 kD) and similar NH<sub>2-</sub> terminal sequences. These similarities suggest that the genes encoding the native Lol p Ib and recombinant Lol p Ib proteins will be different members of the same gene family. Lol p Ib family members are synthesized in pollen as a preallergen with a 25 amino acid signal peptide that targets the allergen to plastids. This is followed by cleavage of the peptide, and in mature pollen the allergen occurs predominantly in the starch grains.</p>Thus, one aspect of the present invention provides purified nucleic acid sequences coding for at least one Lol p Ib ryegrass pollen allergen, or at least one antigenic fragment thereof, or derivative or homologue thereof, or the functional equivalent of such nucleic acid sequence. Preferred nucleic acid sequences coding for Lol p Ib family members include the nucleic acid sequence encoding amino acids -25 through 276 of Lol p Ib.1 as shown in FIGS. 3b and 3c (SEQ ID NO:1), and the nucleic acid sequence encoding amino acids -25 through 314 of Lol p Ib.2 shown in FIGS. 10a and 10b (SEQ ID NO:3). These sequences encode the entire Lol p Ib.1 protein (SEQ ID NO:2) and Lol p Ib.2 protein (SEQ ID NO:4), including the 25 amino acid signal peptide. Other preferred nucleic acid sequences include the nucleic acid sequence encoding amino acids 1-276 of Lol p Ib.1 shown in FIGS. 3b and 3c, and the nucleic acid sequence encoding amino acids 1-314 of Lol p Ib.2 shown in FIGS. 10a and 10b. These nucleic acid sequences encode ",

Pollen was spun out of solution and the extracted protein standardized using the Biorad assay. 120 ug protein per lane was electrophoresed under reducing conditions on a 10-15% w/v SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were electroblotted onto NC filters and the blot blocked with TBS (10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.9) containing 10% w/v non-fat milk powder. The blot was cut into strips and each treated with the various probes: MAbs were diluted 1:1000 in TBS containing 1% BSA. Sera collected from at least 4 patients with high RAST scores for grass pollen, was pooled and used diluted 1:5 in TBS/1% w/v BSA for IgE binding. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used (Dakopatts, Glostrup, Denmark) and after washing, binding was visualized with 4-chloro 1-naphthol (Biorad, Richmond, Calif.) and H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub>.</p>When the immunoblot was incubated in pooled sera from grass pollen-allergic individuals, strong IgE binding was observed throughout the 28-35 kD region. The MAbs used in this study, 3.2, 12.3, 21.3 and 40.1 had previously been partially characterized (Kahn and Marsh (1986) Molec. Immunol. 23: 1281-1288; Singh and Knox (1985) Intl. Arch. Allergy and Applied. Immunol. 78: 300-304; Smart et al. (1983) Intl. Arch. Allergy and Applied Immunol. 72: 243-248). MAbs 3.2, 21.3 and 40.1 showed strong reactivity with the proteins in the 28-35 kD region. MAb 12.3 exhibited no binding to the 35 Kd band, but bound strongly to the lower bands. These interactions suggest that both IgE and MAbs can recognize denatured allergens, which makes them suitable probes for the detection of recombinant protein expressed in E. coli. It was previously thought that MAb FMC-A1 had a strong preference for Lol p Ia, although it would also bind to a lesser extent to Lol p Ib. New data suggests that the original FMC-A1 preparation may be polyclonal rather than monoclonal. One antibody in the FMC-A1 preparation appears to be specific for Lol p Ia while one appears to be specific for Lol p Ib. Therefore, the apparent cross-reaction of Lol p Ia and Lol p Ib defined by FMC-A1 may reflect polyclonality in this antibody preparation.</p>The allergen-beta-galactosidase fusion protein produced by the induction of lysogenic cultures of the lambda clone containing the 12R insert was characterized by immunoblot analysis using MAb 40.1. This fusion protein of approximately 146 kD is assumed to be comprised of the 116 kD beta-galactosidase and 30 kD of allergen-encoded sequence. This fusion protein was produced in low yields. So in order to increase yields of the cloned allergen for further analysis, we used an alternative expression system. The 1.2 kb insert was subcloned in the pGEX1-3 series of plasmid expression vectors. These plasmids give a fusion polypeptide with the carboxyl terminus of the Schistosoma japonicum glutathione S-transferase protein (Smith and Johnson, (1988), Gene, 67:31-40). Strong IgE binding was detected only in bacteria transformed with pGEX-12R, and not in those with parental pGEX plasmids (data not shown, but similar binding shown in FIG. 4). Probing of Western blots with control sera that had negative radioallergosorbent (RAST) score for rye-grass pollen showed no IgE binding.</p>Example 2Identity of Cloned Allergen 12RAll four MAbs used in this study recognized the cloned allergen 12R (FIG. 1a).</p>Not all MAbs show the same specificity to the native Lol p I proteins (FIG. 1b). In particular, MAb 12.3 does not recognize the 35 kD band. Because the cloned allergen binds all the MAbs, and with high intensity to MAb 12.3, it is predicted that the cloned allergen is likely to correspond to a protein of lower Mr, and not to the 35 kD protein. To confirm its identity, an immunological approach developed for parasite antigens was employed (eg Beall &amp; Mitchell (1986) J. Immunol. Methods 86: 217-223). In this method, the cloned allergen 12R was immobilized on nitrocellulose membrane, and used to bind specific IgE antibodies from sera. Bound antibodies were eluted and used to probe a Western blot of rye-grass pollen proteins. Highly specific and reproducible patterns of binding were consistently obtained in several experiments to two protein components of molecular weight 31 and 33 kD. The 35 kD band has been designated Lol p Ia and the 31 and 33 kD bands have been designated Lol p Ib. These experiments demonstrate that IgE antibodies that bind to clone 12R recognize two components with slightly different molecular weights, 31 and 33 kD. No specific binding was observed when IgE antibodies from non-grass pollen allergic individuals were used nor when extracts of E. coli transformed with non-recombinant pGEX plasmids were used to select IgE antibodies.</p>Lol p Ib protein was purified by two-dimensional analysis involving preparative iso-electric focusing in the first dimension, followed by SDS-PAGE of the individual fractions collected. This procedure successfully separated Lol p Ib in sufficient quantity for the N-terminal sequence to be determined (Table 2).</p>              TABLE 2\n______________________________________\nN-Terminal Amino Acid Sequences of Grass Pollen Allergens\nObtained In This Study Compared With Reported Sequences\nAllergen\n       N-terminal sequence\n______________________________________\nLol pIa\n       IAKV?PG??I TAEYGDKWLD AKSTWYGKPT\nLol pIb\n       ADAGYTPAA? ?TPATAP?T\nClone 12R\n       ADAGYTPAAA ATPATPAATP AAAGGKATTD EQKL\nLol pII\n       AAPVEFTVEK GSDEKNLALS IKYNKEGDSM A\nLol pIII\nTKVDLTVEK GSDAKTLVLN IKYTRPGDTL A\nPhl p V\n       ADLGYAPATP AAPGAGYTPA TPAAP\nDac g V\n       GYTPATPAAA GGKATTEEQK L\nPoa p IX\n       ADVGYGAPAT LATPATPAAP AAGYTPAAPA GAAP\n______________________________________\n</pre></p>(The N-terminal amino acid sequences in Table 2 are represented as follows: Lol p Ia--SEQ ID NO:5; Lol p Ib--SEQ ID NO:6; Clone 12R--SEQ ID NO:7; Lol p II--SEQ ID NO:8; Lol p III--SEQ ID NO:9; Phl p V--SEQ ID NO:10; Dac g V,--SEQ ID NO:11; Poa p IX--SEQ ID NO:12)</p>Individual protein components were isolated using preparative isoelectric focussing on the Rotofor (Biorad, Richmond, Calif.). The proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore, Bedford, Mass.). N-terminal sequencing was performed according to Matsudaira (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262: 10035-10038, and Simpson et al. (1989) J. Chromatogr. 476: 345-361.</p>The 31/33 kD protein, Lol p Ib, has a different N-terminal amino acid sequence from Lol p I (Cottam et al. (1986) Biochem J. 234: 305-310; Table 2), described herein as Lol p Ia. It is concluded that the allergen encoded by clone 12R represents a major newly identified allergen, Lol p Ib.1. The nucleotide sequence of clone 12R is shown in FIGS. 3b and 3c (SEQ ID NO:1).</p>Example 3Pollen-Specific Expression of AllergensPoly A+ RNAs were isolated from different plant tissues: seed, leaf, root and pollen. 20 ug of total RNA from the different tissues was electrophoresed on a 1.2% w/v agarose gel in the presence of formamide and formaldehyde (Sambrook, et al., supra), transferred to Hybond-C extra (Amersham, Arlington Heights, Ill.) and the filters baked at 80\u00b0 C. for 2 h. The 1.2 kb 12R cDNA was radio-labelled with <sup>32</sup> P and incubated with the NC filter at 65\u00b0 C. in the presence of 50% v/v formamide. The membrane was washed with 2\u00d7SSC (0.3M NaCl, 0.3M sodium citrate, pH 7.0) containing 0.1% w/v SDS at 65\u00b0 C. Proteins were isolated from the different tissues (flower, leaf, root and pollen) by grinding in 10 mM PBS containing 1 mM PMSF, and immunoblotted (10 ug protein per lane) with the indicated antibodies. The binding was visualized by using <sup>125</sup> I-goat anti-mouse Ig (Amersham, Arlington Heights, Ill.) for MAbs, and polyclonal <sup>125</sup> I-goat anti-human IgE (Kallestad, Chaska, Minn.) followed by autoradiography.</p>Northern blot analysis of RNA prepared from po",

Deletion clones were size selected for DNA sequencing by electrophoresis on agarose gels. DNA sequencing was performed using T7 DNA polymerase and dideoxy nucleotide termination reactions.  <sup>35</sup> S!dATP was used as the label. Sequencing reactions were analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide wedge gels containing 8M urea. Internal sequencing primers were synthesized as necessary. The reading frame was confirmed by sequencing two expression subclones in pGEM vector as detailed in FIG. 4. DNA sequence data were analyzed using the PC GENE System (Intelligenetics, Mountain View, Calif.).</p>The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA clone 12R is GC-rich (61% GC, FIGS. 3b and 3c (SEQ ID NO:1)). As shown in FIGS. 3b and 3c, there is an open reading frame of 903 bp starting with an ATG initiation codon at nucleotide 40 and terminating with a TGA codon starting at nucleotide 943. The proposed translation initiation site and its flanking sequences share 89% homology with the consensus plant sequence AACAATGGC (nucleotides 36-44 of SEQ ID NO:1), and can be considered as in optimum context with the presence of a purine at position -3 (nucleotide 37 of SEQ ID NO:1) from the methionine codon. (Cavener and Ray (1991), Nucleic Acid Res., 19:3185-3192) The open reading frame encodes a protein of predicted Mr 29.8 kD.</p>The predicted protein sequence, which is rich in alanine (32%), has a putative signal or target peptide sequence of 25 amino acids (amino acids -25 through -1 in FIG. 3b and SEQ ID NO:2). This is indicative of a cleaved protein of predicted Mr 27.3 kD. The N-terminal protein sequence of Lol p Ib is identical to the deduced amino acid sequence of clone 12R immediately after the putative cleavage site of the signal peptide sequence. This confirms that the cDNA-12R encodes a Lol p Ib allergenic protein and that the protein has a signal peptide sequence which is cleaved. The protein encoded by the 12R clone has been designated Lol p Ib.1 (SEQ ID NO:2). The deduced amino acid sequence of Lol p Ib.1 is also shown in FIGS. 3b and 3c).</p>The signal sequence has features that are typical of other eukaryotic sequences: a relatively hydrophilic sequence of 5 amino acids at the C-terminus, a relatively hydrophobic sequence extending over most of the signal region which becomes more hydrophilic at the N-terminus (FIG. 3d). The amino acids at the C-terminus include alanine at the cleavage site, an aromatic residue tyrosine at -2, and a helix breaker proline at -6, all of which are common features of the C-terminal region of a signal sequence.</p>A search for consensus glycosylation sequences (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) in the deduced amino acid sequence detected no such sequences. The absence of an N-linked carbohydrate chain on the allergen was confirmed by the lack of deglycosylation following treatment with the enzymes N-glycanase and endo-F glycosidase. Chemical deglycosylation followed by SDS-PAGE showed no decrease in molecular weight of the protein. The 31/33 kD components remained as a doublet, suggesting that the difference in molecular weight is not due to glycosylation. The deglycosylation treatments did not affect IgE binding to the 31/33 kD components. As compared to Lol p Ia which has 5% carbohydrate, no carbohydrate is present in Lol p Ib.</p>The amino acid sequence for Lol p Ib and deduced amino acid sequence of Lol p Ib.1 show protein sequence homology with the published amino acid sequences determined for Phl p V (Matthiesen and Lowenstein (1991) Clin. Exp. Immunol. 21:297-307) and Dac g V (Walsh et al. (1989) Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 91:419-425) from direct protein sequencing and deduced from a Poa p IX cDNA clone (Silvanovich et al. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266:1204-1210). These sequence homologies are indicated in Table 2.</p>Example 5Delineation of IgE- and Mab-Reacting EpitopesTo localize MAb and IgE determinants, an E. coli recombinant expression system was employed (Smith and Johnson (1988) Gene 67: 31-40). Using this system, a number of restriction fragments were subcloned into the expression plasmid pGEX 1-3. The \"in frame\" sub-cloning of full length cDNA into pGEX, expressed the 61 kD fusion protein recognized by both IgE and MAbs 40.1 and 12.3.</p>The full length cDNA 12R or two restriction fragments 1H and 2P (shown in FIG. 4), were subcloned into plasmid expression vector pGEX. The procedure for inducing fusion proteins and preparation of bacterial lysates have been described earlier (Smith and Johnson, supra). The lysates obtained were subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to NC membranes. The blots were probed with IgE antibodies, and MAbs 40.1 and 12.3 as described in relation to FIG. 1b, except that <sup>125</sup> I-anti-human IgE (Kallestad, Chaska, Minn.) was used to detect IgE binding.</p>Immunoblot analysis showed that most of the fusion protein produced is cleaved by bacterial proteases near its fusion site with glutathione-S transferase, generating break-down products which are recognized by IgE antibodies (FIG. 4). The recombinant fusion protein expressed by fragment 2P (GST-2P), although strongly reactive with both MAbs, was not recognized by IgE antibodies in pooled allergic sera. However, the N-terminally truncated protein produced by fragment 1H (GST-1H) was not recognized by either of the MAbs, but was highly reactive with the IgE antibodies.</p>In this way, two distinct domains of the allergen molecule have been delineated: the N-terminal containing fragment 2P has recognition sites for MAbs 12.3 and 40.1; and the C-terminal containing fragment 1H which shows strong IgE binding and thus has the allergenic determinant(s",
    " at these sites.</p>Lol p Ia is located in the cytosol and not in the organelles. These findings were obtained using immuno-gold probes with MAbs specific for Lol p Ia. As shown herein, MAb 12.3, which is specific for Lol p Ib, binds predominantly to the starch grains (FIGS. 5a, b). Grass pollen is filled with starch grains which are 1\u00d72.5 um in size, and originate in the lumen of amyloplasts.</p>As shown in FIG. 5b, the large gold particles located predominantly over the starch grains (large electron-lucent spaces) show binding of MAb 12.3 to Lol p Ib, while smaller particles over the cytosol are typical of binding to Lol p Ia. Scale bar is 1 um. FIG. 5c shows the appearance of fresh, viable pollen after exposure to water for 30 s, dark field illumination. Most pollen grains burst, extruding their cytoplasmic contents, including starch grains (white particles) through the germinal pore. Scale bar, 30 um.</p>The localization of Lol p Ib in the plastids implies that this protein should be transported from the cytosol to the lumen of the plastids during development. For transport to chloroplasts, the proteins which are synthesized in the cytosol are synthesized as large precursors containing a target peptide sequence that is cleaved after transport into the organelle. These intracellular processing steps, synthesis of Lol p Ib first as a pre-allergen in the cytosol and transport to the plastid for post-translational modification, may explain the appearance of the doublet 31/33 kD found by immunoblotting. The unprocessed pre-allergen is 33 kD, and after processing in the plastids, the mature protein is 31 kD. Both these forms co-exist in mature pollen. Alternatively, this doublet may also represent different isoforms or family members of Lol p Ib.</p>Example 7Presentation of Lol p Ib to the Immune SystemWhen the rye-grass flower opens, the anthers are exerted and the pollen is released into the air through a pore which opens at the base of each anther. Rye-grass shows the greatest pollen production of any grass, releasing approximately 460 kg of pollen per hectare into the atmosphere in pastures that are not mowed or grazed. Ninety-nine per cent of this pollen is deposited (and re-deposited) within 1 km of its source. Grass pollen is short-lived, yet it can remain for several days in the atmosphere. Experiments show that the pollen remains viable for only a few hours after release.</p>When viable, the grains can germinate on the stigma, or in artificial media with high levels of osmoticum. Living viable rye-grass pollen grains when exposed to water, burst at the single germinal aperture releasing the cytoplasmic contents (FIG. 5c). Prominent among the released contents are the starch grains. Media with high osmoticum, e.g. 30% w/v sucrose are required to maintain tonicity of the grains. In contrast, it is well-known that dead pollen grains which have no permeability barriers, act like a sponge. Cellular proteins, including allergens, are released from the surface upon moistening.</p>It is easy to see how grass pollen can trigger hay fever after contacting the oral and eye muco",

Proteins separated by gradient SDS-PAGE were electrophoretically transferred from the gel onto nitrocellulose membrane according to the procedure of Towbin et al., (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 76: 4350-4354, in a Bio-Rad (Richmond, Calif.) transblot cell. The proteins on the nitrocellulose were detected by blocking the non-specific sites by incubating the membrane in milk powder as described for slot blots. The membrane was then washed in PBS and immersed in either the MAb solution for two hours or overnight in human serum (a pool of sera obtained from 10 grass-allergic patients) diluted 1:5 in PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 0.1% sodium azide. The membrane, incubated in the MAb solution, was washed in PBS, then incubated with sheep anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Silenus, Australia) diluted 1:500 in PBS-BSA. After washing, the serum blot was first incubated in a solution of rabbit anti-human IgE (Dakopatts, Glostrup, Denmark) diluted 1:200 in PBS-BSA for two hours and then in a solution of goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Promegal, Madison, Wis.) diluted 1:2500 with PBS-BSA for one hour. After washing the antibody binding to the blots was visualized by incubating in peroxidase substrate solution containing 4-chloro-1-napthol and hydrogen peroxide.</p>The fractions containing the GST-1H fusion protein were fractions 9 and 10 as eluted from the FPLC column.

Three strongly growing colonies were cloned to produce MAb lines. When isotyped two lines produced IgG kappa antibodies, designated LpIX-3A and LpIX-4A, and one produced IgM kappa antibody. In a similar fashion, the MAb LpI-7E (7E) was generated using soluble pollen extract as an antigen. MAb LpI-7E is specific for Lol p Ia.</p>These MAbs bind to non-denatured antigens in the pollens of Dactylis glomerata, Festuca elatior, Lolium perenne, Lolium multiflora and Poa pratensis (FIG. 6). On Western blots of soluble pollen proteins separated by SDS-PAGE, MAbs LpIX-3A and LpIX-4A bind to antigens in Festuca elatior, Lolium perenne, Lolium multiflora and Poa pratensis (FIG. 7).

The cDNA of clone 19R possesses the following characteristics suggesting that it contains full-length coding regions:</p>i) The proposed translation initiation site and its flanking sequences (nucleotides 21-29) share 89% homology with the consensus sequence of monocot plants. The most critical nucleotide, a purine at position -3 relative to the ATG start codon (nucleotide 21 in FIG. 10a), is conserved, Cavener, D. R., and Ray, S. C. (1991) Nucleic Acids Research, 19:3185-3192;</p>ii) The cDNA has a complete 3'-untranslated region canonical AATTAA polyadenylation signal, Birnsteil et al. (1985) Cell, 41: 349-359, followed by a poly (A) tail; and</p>iii) The 3'-untranslated region also contains ATTTA which may be associated with mRNA stability.</p>The nucleotide sequence of clone 19R cDNA (SEQ ID NO:3) is G+C rich (63%). The open reading frame potentially encodes a protein, designated Lol p Ib.2 (SEQ ID NO:4) of 314 amino acids with a predicted Mr of 35.3 kD. The predicted protein appears to posses a leader peptide of 25 amino acids on the basis of hydropathy profiles of the N-terminal sequence as shown in FIG. 11, which shows the hydophobicity profile of the predicted amino acid sequence based on the method of Kyte and Doolittle (1982) J. Mol. Biol., 157:105-132, with a window of nine amino acids. This suggests the molecular weight of the mature processed protein is 32.8 kD. No Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequons required for N-glycosylation are found and the predicted pI value for the mature protein is 5.9.</p>Nucleotide and amino acid sequence searches of existing data bases showed that clone 19R only has similarity with Lol p Ib.1 and Poa p IX allergens. There is a 72.3% homology between the nucleotide coding regions of clone 19R (SEQ ID NO:3) and clone 12R (SEQ ID NO:1), as shown in FIGS. 12a and 12b. Amino acid comparison showed 66.8% identity between the predicted amino acid sequences of clone 19R (SEQ ID NO:4) and Lol p Ib.1 (SEQ ID NO:2) as shown in FIG. 13. Both allergens have a very similar 25 amino acid leader peptide. There is a 64-69% identity between the amino acid sequences of clone 19R and the three isoallergens of Poa p IX (Silanovich et al. (1991) J. Biol. Chem., 266:1204-1210).</p>Isolation of Pollen Proteins and ImmunoblottingSoluble proteins were extracted from ryegrass pollen by vigorous shaking in PBS and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride on ice for three hours. Conditions for SDS-PAGE were essentially as described in Ong et al. (1990) Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol., 93:338-343. Immediately after electrophoresis, the separated proteins were either silver stained (Angorge, W. (1982), in \"Electrophoresis '82: Advanced Methods, Biochemical and Clinical Applications, Proceedings of the International Conference on Electrophoresis, Athens, Greece, Apr. 21-24, 1982\", Editor: D. Stathakos, Walter de Gruyeer, Berlin and New York, 1983, pa",
    "than pGEX cultures.</p>Sera used in the experiment identifying fragments of clone 12R and clone 19R which encode IgE binding polypeptides were obtained from fifty subjects selected on the basis of previous clinical record of spring hay fever symptoms and RAST towards ryegrass pollen (Phadezyme RAST, Pharmacia LKB, Sweden). The RAST score for all sera was four. Sera were also obtained from two subjects, who were shown to be non-atopic by RAST, and used as negative controls. Sera were stored at -20\u00b0 C. in small aliquots.</p>Two Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblot AnalysisTwo dimensional (2D)-PAGE was performed in a mini-Protean II 2-D cell (Biorad, Richmond, Calif.) according to the manufacturer instructions. The proteins were diluted 1:1 in 4% CHAPS. An aliquot of 13 mg of protein was applied per gel and the sample overlaid with first dimension sample overlay buffer. The first dimension gel was run for 3.5 hours. The second dimension gel was run for 45 minutes. Proteins on 2D-PAGE gels were silver stained to reveal the protein profile.</p>Conditions for electrophoresis and Western blotting and for the processing of Western blots with MAbs and IgE were as described by Singh, et al., (1985) Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immun., 78:300.</p>Identification of Allergenic Isoforms in Pollen ExtractProbing of Western blots of pollen proteins separated by SDS-PAGE with sera of allergic individuals reveals protein bands at four different molecular weights in the MW range of 28-35 kD that bind IgE. Similar treatment of Western blots of 2D-gels resolved these four bands into twelve allergen spots, as shown in FIG. 17. Using a number of MAbs and IgE preparations the antigenic relationship between these allergens was studied.</p>Two-dimensional Western analyses are shown in FIG. 18 and Table 3. Blots were probed with affinity purified IgE antibodies from Lol p Ib.1, Lol p Ib.2, rfp Lol p Ia, total pooled sera and MAb FMC A7. The total pooled sera have IgE antibodies recognizing two acidic isoforms of the 32 kD component (no. 1, 2), five isoforms of the 30 kD component with pI values in the range of 5-11 (bands 3-7) and a basic band (no. 8) of 28 kD molecule (FIG. 18, panel b). The affinity-purified IgE antibodies from Lol p Ib.1 and Lol p Ib.2 bound to all the isoforms of 28/30/32 kD molecules except isoform no. 5 (FIG. 18, panels d and e). In contrast, MAb FMC-A7 recognized the 32 kD isoforms (bands 1 and 2), two acidic isoforms (bands 3,4) and a basic band no. 7 of the 30 kD component (FIG. 18, panel c).</p>The relative allergenicity of Lol p Ia, Lol p Ib.1 and Lol p Ib.2 were tested using 30 individual allergic sera. FIG. 19 shows that 27 of the patients (90%) have IgE antibodies reactive to Lol p Ia and 6 of them (20% (FIG. 19) have IgE antibodies specific to Lol p Ia (did not bind to either Lol p Ib isoform). Twenty-four patients (80%) have IgE antibodies recognizing both Lol p Ib.1 and Lol p Ib.2 recombinant isoforms. There were 3 patients (10%) who possessed IgE antibodies only recognizing the Lol p Ib isoforms (did not bind to Lol p Ia).</p>              TABLE 3\n______________________________________\nCharacteristics of Allergens on Two Dimensional Gels\nAllergen\n       MW             Mab     IgE\nNo.    (kD)    pI     binding.sup.a\n                              binding.sup.b\n                                         Group\n______________________________________\n1      34      5.5    A1, 7E  AP13R TIgE Ia\n2      34      5.9    A1, 7E  AP13R TIgE Ia\n3      34      6.45   A1, 7E  AP13R TIgE Ia\n4      34      7      A1, 7E  AP13R TIgE Ia\n5      32      6      A1, 3A, 4A\n                              AP12R, AP19R\n                                         Ib\n                              TIgE\n6      32      6.45   A1, 3A, 4A\n                              AP12R, AP19R\n                                         Ib\n                              TIgE\n7      30      6      A1, 3A, 4A\n                              AP12R, AP19R\n                                         Ib\n                              TIgE\n8      30      6.45   A1, 3A, 4A\n                              AP12R, AP19R\n                                         Ib\n                              TIgE\n9      30      7.2    A1, 3A  AP12R, AP19R\n                                         Ib\n                              TIgE\n10     30      8.3    A1, 3A  AP12R, AP19R\n                                         Ib\n                              TIgE\n11     30      10.6   A1, 3A  AP12R, AP19R\n                                         Ib\n                              TIgE\n12     28      8.0    A1, 3A  AP12R, AP19R\n                                         Ib\n                              TIgE\n13     60      7              TIgE       IV\n14     60     "
