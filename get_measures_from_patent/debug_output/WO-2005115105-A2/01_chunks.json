In the experimental disclosure which follows, the following abbreviations apply: \u00b0C. (degrees Centigrade); cm (centimeters); g (grams); 1 or L (liters); \u03bcg (micrograms); \u03bcl (microliters); \u03bcm (micrometers); \u03bcM (micromolar); \u03bcmol (micromoles); mg (milligrams); ml (milliliters); mm (millimeters); mM (millimolar); mmol (millimoles); M (molar); mol (moles); ng (nanograms); nm (nanometers); nmol (nanomoles); N (normal); and pmol (picomoles).</p>EXAMPLE 1 Materials and Methods General Methods: All reagents were used as purchased. 1,4,7,10- tetraazacyclododecane (cyclen) was obtained from Strem. Prohance was purified from the clinically available sample from Bracco Inc. using HPLC. Bovine liver \u03b2- glucuronidase [EC 3.2.1.31] Sigma cat G 0251 and BSA fraction V Sigma cat A 3059 and male human blood serum Sigma cat H 1388 were procured from Sigma. Dry solvents where indicated were obtained from Aldrich as anhydrous Sure-Seal bottles. Water was purified using a Millipore Milli-Q Synthesis purifier. Sugar-containing compounds were \n\nvisualized on silica TLC plates with CAM stain (lg (NH ) Ce(SO ) , 2.5 g (NH ) Mo O ,</p>6 ml cone. H SO , 94 ml water), while compounds containing unmetallated cyclen could be easily detected using a platinum stain (150 mg K PtCl , 10 ml 1 N HCl, 90 ml water,</p>3g KI). NMR spectra were recorded on either a Varian Mercury 400 MHz or Varian Inova 500 MHz instrument. Peaks were referenced to an internal TMS standard. Infrared spectra were measured using a KBr plate on a Biorad FTS-60 FTIR spectrometer. Electrospray mass spectra were obtained via direct infusion of a methanolic solution of the compound of interest on a Varian 1200L single quadrupole mass spectrometer. Elemental analysis was performed by Desert Analytics (Tucson, AZ). ICP-MS were recorded on a VG Elemental PQ Excell spectrometer standardized with eight concentrations spanning the range 0-50 ppb Gd(i\u03c0). One ppb In(HI) was used as the internal standard for all runs.</p>HPLC: LC-MS: Analytical LC-MS was performed on a computer controlled Varian Prostar system consisting of a 410 autosampler equipped with a 100 \u03bcL sample loop, two 210 pumps with 5 ml/min heads, a 363 fluorescence detector, a 330 photodiode array (PDA) detector, and a 1200L single quadrupole ESI-MS. All runs were executed with a 0.8 ml/min flow rate using a ThermoElectron 4.6 x 150 mm 5 \u03bcm Aquasil C18 column, with a 3: 1 split directing one part to the MS and 3 parts to the series-connected light detectors. Mobile phase consisted of water (solvent A) and HPLC-grade acetonitrile (solvent B) except where noted. All injections were full-loop. Preparative LC: The preparative system is a Varian Prostar. Two 210 pumps with 25 ml/min heads fed a 5 ml manual inject sample loop. Detection was performed after a 20:1 split"
