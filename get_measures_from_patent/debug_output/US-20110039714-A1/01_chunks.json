Initially, the user logs in 2102. FIG. 21b is a screen shot of a login screen in one embodiment of this system. The system provides the user with a user interface 2104. In the embodiment shown, the user interface includes various sections, including IC50 2106, Activation 2108, and Search 2110. Because of the flexibility of the user interface, many other potential sections may be included in the interface.</p>In the embodiment shown, the user selects either to view (Search) or create (IC50, Activation) a template configuration 2112. The template configuration 2112 refers to a representation of a plate, which will be used to perform an assay. FIG. 21c illustrates such a representation in one embodiment of this system. The template configuration 2112 includes a compound layout 2114 and a compound concentration 2116 option with corresponding user interface attributes. The user uses these views to specify or view where a compound is to be placed on a plate and what the concentration of each of the plate wells will be.</p>When the user searches for a template configuration, using a form such as the screen shot shown in FIG. 21d, one embodiment of this system utilizes a query component 2118 to access a database (DB) 2010. Results from the database are then formatted by a format component 2120 and provided to some portion of the user interface 2104, template configuration 2112, or analysis components 2122.</p>When the user has completed the template configuration 2112, the embodiment shown provides an analysis interface 2122. The analysis interface provides various views of the data including a calculation view 2124 and a visualization view 2126. Importantly, these views are not mutually exclusive. Also, data changes in one view are automatically and immediately made to the other corresponding view. Because it is critical in some applications that the integrity of raw data be maintained, one embodiment of this system make a copy of the raw data, and all changes t",
    " the selected compound. If the newly selected compound is already displayed, only the table cell will highlight and nothing will be done with the main window.</p>When the user has completed their analysis of the plots created from their data points, the user may print the currently displayed plot(s) and clicks \u2018Done\u2019 to return to Assay Analysis 2126 with their revised data now displayed on the plate layout.</p>An embodiment of this system may include various keyboard controls to perform functions within the Assay Analysis 2124 and IC Plotter 2126 views, both graphical and non-graphical, within the user interface. The following list of commands is utilized by one embodiment:</p>Keyboard Select:1-0Selects Compounds 1 through 10Shift + 1-0Selects Compounds 10 though 20Ctrl+Shft+1-5Selects Compounds 21 though 25Basic Keyboard Control:\u2018Left\u2019Moves the data left\u2018Right\u2019Moves the data right\u2018Up\u2019Inceases the Y-axis Scale\u2018Down\u2019Decreases the Y-axis ScaleCtrl + \u2018Left\u2019Decrease the X-axis ScaleCtrl+\u2018Right\u2019Increase the X-axis ScaleShift+&lt; dir &gt;Multiple action by 5\u2018G\u2019Toggles Grid View on or off\u2018D\u2019Toggles Stadard Deviation Mode\u2018M\u2019Toggles between Multi-Plot and Single PlotAdvanced Keyboard Control:\u2018A\u2019Toggles Autoplotting on for dynamic plotting oroff to speed up complex calculations\u2018P\u2019 or \u2018R\u2019Forces a replot of the data.\u2018I\u2019Reinitialize IC-Plotter (soft restart of the application)\u2018[\u2018Decrease overall Plot Screen\u2018]\u2019Increase overall Plot Screen\u2018O\u2019Toggles Overlay Mode (future release)\u2018C\u2019Toggles IC50 axis reference lines (future release)</p>Additional views may also be provided in an embodiment of this system. For example, the embodiment shown in FIG. 21a includes a report view 2128. From the report view, a user specifies a particular compound about which the user wishes to see additional details. The system then provides the user with a structure and compound data view 2130, which provides details about the compound of interest.</p>In the embodiment shown in FIG. 21a, once the user is satisfied with changes to the copy of the data that the user is manipulating and viewing, the changes are saved to the DB 110. The user is asked whether or not to close the project currently displayed 2132, and if the user responds affirmatively, the user is logged out 2134.</p>FIG. 22 illustrates the process utilized by an embodiment of this system in presenting the user interface and responding to user requests. In the embodiment shown, when the user accesses the system, the user must login 2202. The system accepts username and password and allows selection of analysis or search options. Analysis includes Single or Batch analysis. In one embodiment as a web browser based application, the submit button on the page is clicked, and a cookie is set with the username and password. The application determines the next page to present based on the analysis type or search option selection.</p>If batch analysis is selected, they are directed to ListDir304. If the user selects single analysis t",
    "he page.</p>In one embodiment, a hyperlink is located at the top of the page that allows a user to redirect the project into a search mode. The hyperlink calls the script search.</p>A command button labeled \u2018Submit\u2019 causes a cookie to be set, which contains the selections. As described above, form elements are set based on user selections and the AssayFilterBDI component 2208 is executed.</p>AssayFilterBDI 2208</p>In one embodiment of this system, the AssayFilterBDI 2208 component uploads the files previously selected in ListDir 2202, parses the files, and then inserts the data into the database. The user may be presented with additional options. Based on the selections made by the user or on a predefined logic flow in the BioSelectBDI component, the display component is executed. AssayFilterBDI 2208 also determines the plate layout for the project.</p>To display a potable calculation type, the APTIC component (described below) is executed. If the calculation type is not potable, the appViewBDI component (described below) is executed next.</p>If any information is missing from previous submissions, the cookie is read. If the information needed is still not available, the system provides the user with a dynamically created submission display to supply the missing information, utilizing either the BioSelect 2210 or BioSelectBDI 2206 components.</p>Once the AssayFilterBDI component 2208 is complete, output is created by an embodiment of this system, including but not limited to IC50 2226, PIH 2228, Activation 2230, and Other 2232 output. Output may be displayed in the Assay Data 2124 and IC Plotter 2126 views described above.</p>BioSelect 2210</p>The BioSelect component 2210 in an embodiment of this system allows the user to define the analysis session by target and experiment type. The user uploads the experiment's data file into User interface. Selection can be made between different calculation types and input parameters change according to the user's selection. Form elements are set dynamically as the user interacts with the page.</p>The user interface may include a hyperlink on the page that allows a user to perform a search. The hyperlink calls the search component 2214.</p>In one embodiment, when the user clicks a command button lageled \u2018Submit,\u2019 a cookie is set saving the selections, form elements are set based on user selections and form elements are submitted to the AssayFilter component 2212.</p>AssayFilter 2212</p>The AssayFilter component 2212 uploades the file previously selected in the BioSelect component 2210 to an archive directory and parses the data file, inserting the data into the database. Based on the selections made in the user interface under control of the BioSelect component 2210, the next component is executed. The AssayFilter component 2212 also determines the plate layout for the project.</p>In one embodiment, as with the AssayFilterBDI component 2208, the AssayFilter component 2212 executes the APTIC component (described below) to display a plottable calculation type. If the calculation type is not plottable, the AssayFilter component executes the dbParameters 2304 component (described below in relation to FIG. 23).</p>If any information is missing from previous submissions, the cookie is read. If the information needed is still not available, the system provides the user with a dynamically created submission display to supply the missing information, utilizing either the BioSelect 2210 or BioSelectBDI 2206 components.</p>Once the AssayFilter component is complete, output is created by an embodiment of this system, including but not limited to IC50 2226, PIH 2228, Activation 2230, and Other 2232 output.</p>Search 2214</p>In an embodiment of this system, to perform a search, the search component 2214 first reads the username and password of the user from a cookie. The application next presents the user with a list of search parameters from which to choose, including but not limited to compound ID number, plate number or BDI number. The user enters the correct information for searching and selectes the type of calculation to be used for each item searched for. The calculation may be a predefined calculation, such as IC50, Activation, or Inhibition, or a custom calculation provided by the user. When a user clicks \u2018Search\u2019, the validity of input is checked, the cookie is updated and the form elements are submitted to the format_search component 2216.</p>Format Search 2216</p>The Format_Search component 2216 formats the search criteria on the basis of the search type entered by the user. For example, in one embodiment, if the user selects IC50 or Activation, the format_search component 2216 calls the updateDBIC50 component 2310 (described below); otherwise the format_search component calls the appViewBDI2 component 2412 (described below). Comparisons are made between the information in the database and the user defined selections. If an error occurs, or an improper selection has been made the component 2216 detects the error and presents the user interface for Search to the user. If any information is missing, the cookie is checked for missing values. If the information is correct the page continues to the next script.</p>An embodiment of the present system is capable of performing various types of searches, including but not limited to IC50 2218, PIH 2220, Activation 2222, and Other 2224 searches.</p>FIG. 23 illustrates the process for analyzing and manipulating IC50 data in an embodiment of this system. Many of the components utilized by an embodiment in performing an IC50 analysis, data manipulation, and search are also used for other types of searches. In such cases, the components are numbered identically in FIGS. 23-25.</p>Dbparameters 2304</p>In an embodiment of this system, the dbparameters component 2304 is a dynamic user interface, such as a web page, that is used to provide additional information useful for identifying submitted plates. In one embodiment, the interface includes controls in which a user enters numbers that identify the plate(s). These numbers are used to reference a corporate, proprietary, or other database structure for information relating to these plates.</p>In some instances, the layout of the plate is derived from previously submitted information within the database structure. In such a situation, the dbparameters component 2304 uses this stored information to fill in at least some of the elements of the user interface, thereby limiting the demands on the user.</p>In one embodiment, if plate layout information is available, a template representing the plate is dynamically created from that information and displayed on the user interface within the project. The template may be modified by the user within the analysis portion of the user interface, alleviating the need for the user to move between user interface screens to make the modifications.</p>In an embodiment performing IC50 analysis, manipulation, and/or visualization, the dbparameters component 2304 calls the templateSelectBDI component 2306, passing the user-supplied or database-derived parameters. In other embodiments, such as for analyzing Activation and PIH, the updateBDI_Info component 2406 is called.</p>templateSelectBDI 2306</p>In an embodiment of this system, the templateSelectBDI component 2306 is a user interface component, such as a web page, that allows users to define a template for use in analysis. In a multiple plate analysis, this template is used for the batch of plates as well. This dynamic interface uses the information from the dbparameters component 2304, either user or database-derived, and additional information from the database(s) to dynamically define a basic template.</p>In one embodiment, as illustrated by the screen shot of FIG. 23a, plate wells that do not contain compound are colored black. C+ and C\u2212 control wells are colored light-grey and dark grey, respectively. Compound wells are a default white.</p>The user interface provides a means to make changes to the templates. For example, in the embodiment shown in FIG. 23a, command buttons exist within the interface allowing the user to define the mouse interaction with the component or techlet. If the user clicks \u2018C+\u2019, mouse drags over the techlet will define C+ control wells. Likewise, if the user clicks \u2018C\u2212\u2019, mouse drags over the techlet will define C\u2212 control wells. If the user clicks \u2018Invalid\u2019, the mouse de"
