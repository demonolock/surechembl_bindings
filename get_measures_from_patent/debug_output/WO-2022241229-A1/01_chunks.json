Specifically, an antigen is a substance which serves as a target for the receptors of an adaptive immune response. Typically, an antigen is a molecule that binds to antigen- specific receptors but cannot induce an immune response in the body by itself. Antigens are </p>21 \n\nusually proteins and polysaccharides, less frequently also lipids. As used herein, antigens also include immunogens and haptens. </p>[0062] An \u201cFc\u201d region comprises two heavy chain fragments comprising the CHI and CH2 domains of an antibody. The two heavy chain fragments are held together by two or more disulfide bonds and by hydrophobic interactions of the CH3 domains. </p>[0063] The \u201cFv region\u201d comprises the variable regions from both the heavy and light chains but lacks the constant regions. </p>[0064] An antibody that \u201cspecifically binds to\u201d or is \u201cspecific for\u201d a particular polypeptide or an epitope on a particular polypeptide is one that binds to that particular polypeptide or epitope on a particular polypeptide without substantially binding to any other polypeptide or polypeptide epitope. For example, the Coronavirus S protein specific antibodies of the present invention are specific to Coronavirus S protein. In some embodiments, the antibody that binds to Coronavirus S protein has a dissociation constant (Kd) of \u00a3100 nM, \u00a310 nM, \u00a31 nM, \u00a30.1 nM, \u00a30.01 nM, or \u00a30.001 nM (e.g., 10<sup>-8</sup>M or less, e.g., from 10<sup>_8</sup>M to 10<sup>-13</sup>M, e.g., from 10<sup>-9</sup>M to 10<sup>-13</sup> M). </p>[0065] The term \u201ccompete\u201d when used in the context of antigen binding proteins (e.g., atnibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof) that compete for the same epitope means competition between antigen binding proteins as determined by an assay in which the antigen binding protein (e.g., antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof) being tested prevents or inhibits (e.g., reduces) specific binding of a reference antigen binding protein (e.g., a ligand, or a reference antibody) to a common antigen (e.g., Coronavirus S protein or a fragment thereof). Numerous types of competitive binding assays can be used to determine if one antigen binding protein competes with another, for example: solid phase direct or indirect radioimmunoassay (RIA), solid phase direct or indirect enzyme immunoassay (EIA), sandwich competition assay (see, e.g., Stahli et al., 1983, Methods in Enzymology 9:242- 253); solid phase direct biotin-avidin EIA (see, e.g., Kirkland et al., 1986, J. Immunol. 137:3614-3619) solid phase direct labeled assay, solid phase direct labeled sandwich assay (see, e.g., Harlow and Lane, 1988, Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Press); solid phase direct label RIA using 1-125 label (see, e.g., Morel et al, 1988, Molec. Immunol. 25:7-15); solid phase direct biotin-",

The selected IgGs were then expressed recombinantly in vitro and characterized by binding specificities to b-CoV prefusion- stabilized S, namely HCoV-HKUl S-2P, MERS-CoV S-2P, and SARS-CoV S-2P. IgG20, IgG23 and IgG62 demonstrated cross-reactive binding to MERS- and SARS-CoV S with higher apparent affinity to the former (FIG. 9A). Intriguingly, IgG21, IgG22 and IgG72 were also MERS- and SARS-specific, but the association rates of these mAbs to SARS-CoV S were nearly 5-fold higher than to MERS-CoV S (FIG. 9B). In contrast, IgG12, IgG19 and IgG42 only bound to MERS-CoV S (FIG. 9C). Competitive binding experiments with G4, the only MERS S2-targeted antibody with a structurally defined epitope, were also performed (Pallesen et ak, 2017). One third of selected mAbs (IgG20, IgG23 and IgG62) competed with G4 binding to MERS-CoV S (FIG. 10). By contrast, IgG12, IgG19, IgG21, IgG22, IgG42, and IgG72 appeared to bind to regions outside of the G4 epitope. </p>Example 5 - IgG22 binds to multiple CoV spikes and neutralizes authentic MERS-CoV</p>[00174] IgG22 and the clonally related IgG72 are two of the cross-reactive antibodies that exhibited faster association to SARS-CoV S than MERS-CoV S (FIG. 9B). To determine the kinetics of their interactions, surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed where Fab was flowed over spike ectodomain immobilized to a sensor chip. The binding affinity of Fab22 to MERS-CoV S was comparable to those of SARS-CoV S and SARS-CoV-2 S, with KD values of 2.9 nM, 7.2 nM, and 6.7 nM, respectively (FIGS. 5A-C). However, Fab22 exhibited distinct binding kinetics to MERS-CoV S, featuring a much slower on-rate and off-rate than SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 S. The neutralization activities of selected mAbs were examined against authentic MERS-CoV. IgG22 and IgG72 exhibited </p>65 \n\npotent neutralizing activity, with IC50 values of 0.12 pg/rnL and 2.45 pg/mL, respectively (FIG. 5D). On the other hand, IgG20, IgG21 and IgG42 showed no neutralization activity against MERS-CoV. Interestingly, IgG22 and IgG72 failed to neutralize authentic SARS- CoV-2 (FIG. 5E), which may be due to the faster off-rate of IgG22 to SARS-CoV-2. </p>Example 6 - Cryo-EM structure of Fab22 bound to the MERS-CoV spike</p>[00175] To investigate Fab22 and Fab72 binding sites on the spikes, negative stain electron microscopy (nsEM) analysis were performed for the Fab-spike complexes. 2D classification showed three distinct densities for Fab22 attached to the S2 stalk region of MERS-CoV S-2P, a region that undergoes substantial conformation changes during the pre- to-postfusion transition (FIG. 11 A). Interestingly, Fab72 also binds to a similar region of S2 in proximity to HR2 (FIG. 1 IB). Given that binding of HR2 could potentially prevent virus cell membrane fusion, a cryo-EM structure of Fab22 bound to MERS S-2P was determined. Resembling the nsEM analysis, three distinct Fab9 densities were seen from multiple 2D classes (FIG. 5F). The initial 3D reconstruction exhibited a single conformation of the spike, with all three RBDs in the down conformation. A total of 183,556 particles led to a 3.3 A reconstruction with well-defined side chain densities at the core of S2. Three Fab densities could be visualized at the bottom stalk of S2, although one of the Fabs displayed a broader than usual Fab density. It is possible t"
