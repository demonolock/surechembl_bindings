    "s their pharmaceutical compositions, methods of using the same in delivering payloads to subjects in need thereof, and methods of using the same in treating diseases.</p>BACKGROUNDUsually, the pathological and physiological characteristics of diseased cells and normal cells are significantly different, and one of the differences is that the surfaces of diseased cells have specific or overexpressed materials (such as, antigen, chemical signals, receptors, etc.), which are absent or lowly-expressed in normal cells. Based on this principle, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and polypeptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) were developed for the treatment of diseases. Currently, although some ADCs and PDCs drugs were marketed or under clinical researches, there are many limitations on ADCs and PDCs in clinical due to the design rationale of these drugs.</p>ADCs have gained much foothold recently with the approval of Adcetris from Seattle Genetics in 2011 and Kadcyla from Genentech in 2013 and remains a hot R&amp;D development area with over 30 drugs in clinical trials. Nonetheless, ADCs development faces a multitude of difficulties ranging from the lack of suitable targets, manufacturing hurdle and low drug stability due to the complex nature and large molecular weight of the ADCs. Currently, ADCs are mainly used in the treatment of cancers. In some instances, the affinity of the target antibody towards the antigen on cancer cell surface could be as high as 10<sup>\u22129</sup>\u02dc10<sup>\u221212 </sup>(Kd, mole/liter). Therefore, the ADCs, while having high specificity to target cells, also have high specificity to normal cells with the same target receptor(s) as the target cells. Meanwhile, it could take a long time (one to three weeks) to metabolize ADCs in vivo, during which it could continuously kill the normal cells, and thus significantly increase the toxic side effects of ADCs. Therefore, the more ideal indications of ADCs should be the diseases characterized in that the amounts of cell surface antigens in tumor and normal cells are significantly different. However, very few diseases known in the art can meet such strict requirement.</p>Another group of drug conjugate compounds are the ligand-drug conjugates (LDCs) where ligands are either peptide or small molecule. However, there are various problems to the application of LDCs, ranging from bioavailability, stability, efficacy, to toxicity. For example, many ligands are unable to enter into cells due to their large molecular weights, lipophilicity, or other attributes, limiting their therapeutic applications. In addition, the therapeutic effects are generally low if the ligands are conjugated with conventional chemotherapeutics (such as doxorubicin, paclitaxel, etc.), while the toxicities are high if they are conjugated with highly effective drug molecules (such as MMAE, DM1), and thus resulting in animal poisoning death even before the therapeutically effective amount is achieved for tumor treatment.</p>SUMMARY OF ",
