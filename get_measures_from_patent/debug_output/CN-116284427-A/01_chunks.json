    "er may vary with the type of secondary structural element that needs to be achieved in the linker. In the summary or embodiments of the invention, when describing the structure of an antibody, different L (e.g., L1, L2, L3, L4, L5, L6, L7) are used only to schematically represent peptide linkers at different attachment positions in the structure, and there is no limitation on the structure of L. Different L in the same structure or L in different structures may be the same or different. </p>In the present invention, the term \"knob-into-hole modification\" means that the Fc domain of an antibody comprises amino acid mutations that result in the formation of a knob-into-hole pairing between two Fc polypeptide monomers. For example, amino acids at appropriate sites in the CH3 domain in one Fc polypeptide monomer are substituted with relatively large amino acid residues to form a pestle structure; the amino acid in the corresponding position in the CH3 domain in the other Fc polypeptide monomer is substituted with a relatively small amino acid residue to form a mortar structure.</p>In the present invention, the terms \"anti\", \"binding\", \"specific binding\" refer to a non-random binding reaction between two molecules, such as a reaction between an antibody and an antigen against which it is directed. Typically, the antibody is present at less than about 10 <sup>-7</sup> M, e.g. less than about 10 <sup>-8</sup> M\u300110 <sup>-9</sup> M\u300110 <sup>-10</sup> M\u300110 <sup>-11</sup> An equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of M or less binds to the antigen. In the present invention, the term \"KD\" refers to the equilibrium dissociation constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction, which is used to describe the binding affinity between an antibody and an antigen. The smaller the equilibrium dissociation constant, the tighter the antibody-antigen binding, and the higher the affinity between the antibody and antigen. For example, the binding affinity of an antibody to an antigen is determined in a BIACORE instrument using surface plasmon resonance (Surface Plasmon Resonance, abbreviated SPR) or the relative affinity of an antibody to antigen binding is determined using ELISA. </p>In the present invention, the term \"epitope\" refers to a polypeptide determinant that specifically binds to an antibody. An epitope of the invention is a region of an antigen to which an antibody binds.</p>Bispecific antibodies</p>The bispecific antibody of the present invention (diabody, anti-MUC 17/CD3 bispecific antibody, human MUC17 and CD3 binding bispecific antibody, or anti-MUC17 XCD 3 BsAb) is a bispecific antibody capable of binding to both human MUC17 and CD3, comprising a human MUC17 binding antibody or a human MUC17 binding antibodyAn antigen binding fragment, and an Fc domain that binds a human CD3 antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof, and optionally. The structure of the antigen binding fragment may be selected from the group consisting of: (i) Fab fragments; (ii) F (ab') <sub>2</sub> Fragments; (iii) Fab' fragments; (iv) Fv fragments; or (v) a single chain Fv (scFv).</p>Bispecific antibodies of the invention may be dimers, trimers or multimers, preferably homo-or heterodimers. The anti-MUC17 or anti-CD 3 antibody moiety in the bispecific antibodies of the invention ",
    "l LS174T cells</p>T cells expressing the CD3 molecule (cd3+ T cells) are incubated with an adherent anti-CD 3 antibody, and the cd3+ T cells are activated, which can kill tumor cells. Colorectal cancer LS174T cells are paved into a 96-well plate for the experiment, anti-MUC17 xCD 3 BsAb is added for co-incubation, and CD3+ T cells are added for co-culture, so that the LS174T cells can be killed after the CD3+ T cells are activated.</p>The experimental conditions and steps are as follows:</p>1. LS174T cells in log phase were plated in 96-well plates, 5000/100. Mu.L/well. Placing at 37deg.C, 5% CO <sub>2</sub> Culturing overnight in an incubator.</p>2. Antibody and cd3+ T cells were added: diluting the anti-CD 3 antibody and anti-MUC17 XCD 3 BsAb, gradually diluting by four times according to 4 Xworking concentration (800 nM), adding 50 \u03bcL/well into 96-well cell culture plate, and the final concentration of antibody is 200nM; CD3+ T cells, 2.5X10 <sup>4</sup> mu.L/well was added to the 96-well plate. Placing at 37deg.C, 5% CO <sub>2</sub> Culturing in an incubator for 72 hours.</p>3. Color development reading plate: the 96-well plate was removed from the incubator, 150. Mu.l/well of supernatant was pipetted off, and 50. Mu.l/well of cell Titer Glo reagent was added. After incubation at room temperature for about 5 minutes, the luminence was read with Spectramax i 3.</p>4. Data analysis: the obtained values were analyzed by GraphPad Prism software fitting to obtain data such as IC 50.</p>The experimental results are shown in FIG. 6, which shows the IC for detecting sample CM2 <sub>50</sub> IC of 0.28nM, CM7 <sub>50</sub> 0.28nM, but CM7 has a lower plateau than CM2, so its killing activity is slightly better than CM2. While the anti-CD 3 antibody, huSP34, had no significant killing effect, probably due to the inability of the huSP34 antibody to immobilize LS174T cells.</p>In summary, the bispecific antibody anti-MUC17\u00d7CD3 BsAb provided by the invention can bind to LS174T cells expressing MUC17 on the cell surface, and can play a role of anti-CD 3 antibody to activate T cells. And the activity of the constructed clones CM7 and CM8 is better by combining the screening results.</p>In summary, anti-MUC17\u00d7cd3bsab targets tumor cells by anti-MUC17 antibodies, while exerting the effect of anti-CD 3 antibodies to activate T cells; the bispecific antibody can crosslink activated T cells and tumor cells, so that the tumor cells can be killed more effectively; the Fc-terminus of the antibody can also bind NK receptors to kill tumors.</p>TABLE 6 antibody sequence listing</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>Sequence listing</p>&lt;110&gt; Dansheng medicine technology (Shanghai) Co., ltd</p>&lt;120&gt; anti-MUC 17/CD3 bispecific antibody, method for producing the same, and use thereof</p>&lt;160&gt; 53</p>&lt;170&gt; SIPOSequenceListing 1.0</p>&lt;210&gt; 1</p>&lt;211&gt; 20</p>&lt;212&gt; PRT</p>&lt;213&gt; Artificial sequence (Artificial Sequence) </p>&l"
