    " 9 hours after administration. In addition, as shown in fig. 7, the compound of formula I also had a greater effect on pupil constriction than compound 3.</p>Such results would not be expected since based on the in vitro data from example 1, all compounds are expected to have very similar miotic activity.</p>Example 3</p>Melanin binding</p>An assay was performed in which melanin binding of the compound of formula I was measured and compared to melanin binding of additional compounds, including brimonidine (whose binding was previously determined by the inventors).</p>Specifically, the compound of formula I (Compound 1), compound 2 and the positive control (chloroquine; compound 5) were tested for binding to synthetic melanin. The tested concentrations of compound of formula I (compound 1) and compound 2 ranged from 1.29ng/mL to 12,500ng/mL, and chloroquine ranged from 19.8ng/mL to 8000ng/mL. Compound stock solutions were prepared in dimethylsulfoxide in 0.5% or 0.6% (v/v) formic acid (compound 1 and compound 2, respectively) or water (chloroquine), then further diluted to the indicated curve range in PBS and incubated with or without melanin for 1 hour at 37 \u2103. Only aliquots of the PBS curve were quenched at time zero to serve as stability controls and calibration standards. After centrifugation, the samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS bioanalysis. The concentration was calculated back using the assay PBS curve for binding and stability calculations. The results of the melanin binding assay and comparison with previously determined brimonidine melanin binding can be seen in table 2.</p>TABLE 2</p></p>As can be seen from table 2, the compounds of formula I show significantly and unexpectedly lower binding than other alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonists including brimonidine. Specifically, at an average percent binding of about 10% or less, the compound of formula I can be considered to have no significant melanin binding, in contrast to the much more significant binding of brimonidine.</p>Example 4</p>Treatment of presbyopia</p>A 56 year old female complains of a lack of text focus when reading at close distance, which affects her ability to read documents at work and to read books and news articles. The problem appears to be more severe in lower lighting conditions, such as dim lighting in a restaurant. Visual deterioration has occurred over time, but in the last months, it was more evident that the woman was unable to focus on the text when reading at close range, thereby affecting her quality of life. An ophthalmologist visiting the woman performs a visual acuity test that asks her to read the alphabetic line on the eye chart without the aid of glasses or contact lenses (neither of which she wears). She finds that she can only read the first four rows on the table, and a person with normal vision should be able to read six rows. Based on the age of the woman and the test results, she was diagnosed with presbyopia. This woman is reluctant to obtai"
