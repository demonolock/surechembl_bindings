{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nThe results of the melanin binding assay and comparison with previously determined brimonidine melanin binding can be seen in table 2.\nAs can be seen from table 2, the compounds of formula I show significantly and unexpectedly lower binding than other alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonists including brimonidine. \nSpecifically, at an average percent binding of about 10% or less, the compound of formula I can be considered to have no significant melanin binding, in contrast to the much more significant binding of brimonidine."}
