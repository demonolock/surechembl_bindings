    "ted in a 5.0 kb fragment (FIG. 12D). The flanking sequence probe can also show if homoplasmy of the chloroplast genome has been achieved through the three rounds of selection. The plants expressing CTB-NSP4 showed homoplasmy as there is no wild type band seen in transgenic lines within the levels of detection. The gene specific probe CTB-NSP4 of size approx. 0.7 kb was used to show the specific gene integration producing a fragment of 11 kb when CTB-NSP4 transgenic plant DNA was digested with ClaI as shown in FIGS. 12C and 12E.</p>Immunoblot AnalysisCrude protein extract of 20 ug, was loaded in each well of the SDS-PAGE. The rabbit anti-NSP4<sub>90 </sub>antibodies (provided by Dr. William Langridge, Loma Linda Univ. of Loma Linda) were used to detect the 27 kDa and 135 kDa monomeric and pentameric forms CTB-NSP4 fusion protein (FIG. 13). The wild type plant (Petit havana) did not show any bands indicating that the anti-NSP4 antibodies did not cross react with any other proteins in the crude extract. As the CTB-NSP4 expression level was 2.45% of TSP in mature leaves, which indicates that there is 2.4 ug of the fusion protein in 100 ug of TSP. the total crude protein extract loaded in each well is 20 ug and so the expected amount of CTB-NSP4 fusion protein present in 20 ug of TSP will be about 0.6 ug. Hence each of the wells contains approximately about 0.6 ug of the CTB-NSP4 protein detected by the CTB-NSP4 antibodies.</p>Protein Quantification and Binding Affinity using GM1 Binding Assay ELISA</p>The levels of pentameric CTB-NSP4 fusion protein in transformed tobacco plants and its affinity for GM1-ganglioside was evaluated by quantitative GM1 ELISA. The standard curve has been obtained using different dilutions of purified CTB-NSP4. The dilutions were made in 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The primary antibody used was Rabbit antibody raised against NSP4<sub>90 </sub>protein expressed and purified from E. coli BL21 cells and secondary antibodies were donkey anti-rabbit antibodies peroxidase conjugated. The percentage of CTB-NSP4 expressed was as a percent of total soluble protein calculated using the Bradford assay i.e. the percentage of CTB-NSP4 is inversely proportional to the TSP values. The CTB-NSP4 expression levels reached a maximum of 2.45% of the total soluble protein in the mature leaves after 1 Day of continuous light exposure due to increase in translation obtained under the control of light regulated psbA 5,UTR as shown in FIG. 14. The increased expression in mature leaves is due to more number of chloroplasts and high number of chloroplast genomes (upto 10,000 copies/cell) in the mature leaves. Also, the large size and more number of mature leaves per plant contributed to the higher levels of CTB-NSP4 in mature leaves.</p>DiscussionThe pLD-5\u2032UTR-Histag-CTB-NSP4 chloroplast transformation vector containing the aadA gene, CTB-NSP4 coding region and 3\u2032 psbA, integrates the transgene cassette into the transcriptionally active ",
    " transgenic plant might retrograde back to the wild type eliminating the transgene in the absence of selection pressure in subsequent generations. The chimeric, aminoglycoside 3\u2032 adenyl transferase (aadA) gene, conferring resistance to spectinomycin was used as a selectable marker and its expression is driven by the 16S (Prrn) promoter (15, 39). Spectinomycin binds the 70S ribosome and inhibits translocation of peptidal tRNA's from the A site to the P site during protein synthesis. The aadA gene codes for the enzyme aminoglycoside 3\u2032 adenlyltransferase, which transfers the adenlyl moiety of ATP to spectinomycin and inactivating it. Fourth, chloroplast translation system provides the necessary enzymes for proper folding and disulphide bond formation. Chaperonins present in chloroplast are thought to aid in the folding and assembly of non native prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins (15, 40). Reversible activation of genes that regulate expression in the chloroplast is the Protein Disulfide Isomerase (PDI) system composed of chloroplast polyadenylate-binding proteins that specifically bind to the 5\u2032UTR of the psbA mRNA and are modulated by redox status through PDI (37). The ability of chloroplasts to form disulfide bonds and properly fold foreign proteins eliminates a major part of the costly downstream processing. The chloroplast expressed CTB-NSP4 fusion protein folded properly into functional pentameric form which was clearly seen on the immunoblot. The positive result in GM1 binding assay with CTB-NSP4 has reconfirmed the pentamer forms of CTB-NSP4 from transgenic tobacco chloroplasts.</p>Chloroplast transformants were distinguished from the nuclear transformants and mutants by PCR analysis. Southern blot analysis with gene specific CTB-NSP4 probe and flaking probe for chloroplast genome was done to confirm the site-specific integration of the gene cassette and also to determine the homo or heteroplasmy. High protein expression levels were obtained in the mature leaves after Day 1 of continuous light exposure of up to 2.45% of the total soluble protein which was quantified using the GM1 binding assay.</p>The present study reports the successful expression of the CTB-NSP4 fusion protein as pentameric forms. This opens the doors for the expression of CTB-NSP4 in carrot plastids so as to enable oral delivery of the vaccine antigen. The immunogenecity of the vaccine antigen needs to be tested in an animal model which is underway.</p>Materials and MethodsConstruction of pLD-5\u2032UTR-His CTBNSP4 Vector for Transformation of Tobacco Chloroplast</p>Initially the gene cassette Histag-CTB-NSP4 was cloned downstream to 5\u2032UTR in p-bluescript between EcoRV and EcoRI sites. Then the final gene cassette containing the 5\u2032UTR and His-CTB-NSP4 (approximate size 0.7 kb) were digested with EcoRV and XbaI and cloned into tobacco universal vector pLD-Ctv between EcoRV and XbaI.</p>Bombardment and Transgenic Plant RegenerationSterile Nicotiana tabacum cv. Petit Havana tobacco leaves were bombarded using the Bio-Rad PDS-1000/He biolistic device as previously described [32,33,35]. The bombarded leaves were allowed to incubate in dark for 48 hours to recover from tissue damage and then were placed on RMOP medium containing 5001 g/ml spectinomycin for two rounds of selection on plates and subsequently moved to jars with MSO medium containing 500 \u03bcg/ml spectinomycin</p>Confirmation of Transgene Integration into the Chloroplast Genome</p>To confirm the transgene cassette integration into the chloroplast genome, PCR was performed using the primer pairs 3P (5\u2032-AAAACCCGTCCTCGTTCGGATTGC-3\u2032)-3M",
    " was used as the primary Ab, and alkaline phosphatase conjugated rabbit antichicken IgG (Chemicon) at a dilution of 1:5000 was used as a secondary Ab.</p>ELISAThe CTB-GFP quantification was done using the ELISA (ELISA). The standards and test samples were diluted in coating buffer (15 mM Na2CO3, 35 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 3 mM NaN3, pH 9.6). The standards, ranging from 50 to 500 ng, were made by diluting recombinant GFP in 1% PBS. The leaf samples were collected from plants exposed to regular lighting pattern (16 h light and 8 h dark), and total protein was extracted using plant protein extraction buffer. Standard GFP dilutions (100 \u03bcl) and protein samples were bound to a 96-well plate overnight at 4\u00b0 C. The background was blocked with fat-free milk in PBST for 1 h at 37\u00b0 C. followed by washing with PBST and water. Primary Ab used was polyclonal chicken anti-GFP Ab (Chemicon) diluted (1:3000) in PBST containing milk powder. Secondary Ab was BRP-conjugated rabbit anti-chicken IgG-secondary Ab (Chemicon) at a 1: 5000 dilution in PBST containing milk powder. For the color reaction, 100 \u03bcl of 3,3<sub>\u2014</sub>,5,5_-tetramethyl benzidine (TMB from American Qualex) substrate was loaded in the wells and incubated for 10-15 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 \u03bcl of 2N sulfuric acid per well, and the plate was read on a plate reader (Dynex Technologies) at 450 nM.</p>GM1 Binding AssayTo test the functionality of CTB-GFP expressed in chloroplasts, a CTB-GM1 binding assay was performed. We coated 96-well plates with 100 \u03bcl of monosialoganglioside-GM 1 (Sigma) (3.0 ng/ml in bicarbonate buffer) and incubated them overnight at 4\u00b0 C. After washing with PBST and water, the standards and samples were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0 C. The plate was blocked with 1% BSA in 1\u00d7PBS for 1 h at 37\u00b0 C. Rabbit anti-CTB primary Ab (Sigma) and alkaline phosphatase (activating protein) conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary Ab (Sigma) was used to detect the CTB binding to GM1 receptor. The plates were washed with PBST and water, and 200 \u03bcl of the substrate p-Nitrophenyl phosphate (PNPP) was added to the wells and incubated in the dark at 37\u00b0 C. for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 gl of 3N NaOH, and the plates were read on a plate reader (Dynex Technologies) at 405 nM.</p>Animal StudiesThree groups of 5-week-old female Balb/c mice were fed with CTB-GFP, IFN alpha5-GFP (IFN-GFP), and wild-type (untransformed) plant leaf material. Leaves (350 mg) were powdered in liquid nitrogen, mixed with peanut butter, and fed to the mice, which had been starved overnight prior to this experiment. The mice were then gavaged for two more days, two times a day, with 40 mg of leaf material per gavage that was powdered with liquid nitrogen and mixed with 0.1M PBS (PBS). Five hours after the last gavage, the mice were sacrificed and perfused with 10 ml of PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Fresh frozen sections of the liver, spleen, ileum, and jejunum we",
    " with and without PMSF. Still, some protein did not get cleaved, probably because the amount of enzyme was not sufficient to cleave all the CTB-GFP protein present in the plant extract. The incubation time of 4 h might also have been insufficient. However, the presence of the cleaved GFP product in the samples incubated with furin confirms that the engineered furin cleavage site is functional. The introduction of furin consensus sequences at the Bchain/C-peptide and the C-peptide/A-chain interfaces of human proinsulin has been demonstrated to increase the processing of proinsulin to mature insulin in a wide variety of non-neuroendocrine cells, including fibroblasts, myoblasts, epithelial cells, and lymphocytes (3642). As the furin cleavage site is also recognized by the endopeptidases PC2 and PC3/1, it is likely that CTB-GFP fusion protein is cleaved more efficiently during the process of receptor-mediated delivery.</p>Quantification of CTB-GFPTo quantify the amount of CTB-GFP fusion protein in transgenic tobacco leaves, ELISA (ELISA) was performed (FIG. 41B). A standard curve was obtained using different concentrations of recombinant GFP. The amount of CTB-GFP in the transgenic plants was compared with the known concentrations of the recombinant GFP (standard curve). Expression levels of CTBGFP ranged from 19.09 to 21.3% total soluble protein.</p>GM1 Binding AssayThe functionality of chloroplast-derived CTB-GFP was determined by its ability to bind to GM1 in an in vitro GM1 binding assay (FIG. 41C). GM1 binding assay showed that pentamers of CTB-GFP were formed. This finding confirms the correct folding and disulfide bond formation of CTB pentamers within transgenic chloroplasts because only the pentameric form of CTB can bind to GM1 (21).</p>Fluorescent Microscopy to Detect the Presence of GFP in the TissueFixed tissue and fresh frozen sections of the liver, spleen, ileum, and jejunum were made from the three groups of mice fed with plants expressing CTB-GFP, IFN-GFP, and WT plants, respectively. In mice fed with CTB-GFP expressing plant leaf material, fluorescence microscopy showed the presence of GFP in intestinal mucosa and submucosa (FIG. 42A), the hepatocytes of the liver (FIG. 42D) as well as various cells of the spleen (FIG. 42G). In the mice fed with wild-type (untransformed) leaf material, no GFP fluorescence was observed (FIGS. 42B, E, and B). In the mice fed with IFN-GFP expressing plant leaf material, no GFP was detected in the liver or spleen (FIGS. 42F and I). Detection of GFP in the liver and spleen following oral delivery of CTB-GFP expressing plant leaf material, suggests the successful delivery of the protein across the intestinal lumen into the systemic circulation. Moreover, the lack of detection of a significant amount of GFP in the liver and spleen of mice fed with IFN-GFP expressing plants suggests that a transmucosal carrier such as CTB is required for delivery of an adequate amount of a macromolecule across the intestinal lumen into the systemic cir"
