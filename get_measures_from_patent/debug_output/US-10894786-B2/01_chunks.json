    " Cells were harvested and lysed. 200 \u03bcg of the lysate was incubated with 1 \u03bcM Bio-THZ531 in the presence of 1 mM DTT and incubated on a rocker at 4\u00b0 C. overnight. 100 \u03bcL of this sample was added to pre-washed streptavidin coated plates and incubated at room temperature on a rocker for 2 hours. The plates were washed and incubated with CDK12 antibody for overnight at 4\u00b0 C. Next day the plate was washed and incubated for 2 hours with HRP labelled anti rabbit secondary antibody. Bio-THZ531 bound CDK12 was determined using TMB substrate. The plates were read using the M3 spectrophotometer at 450 nM and 570 nM. Percentage CDK12 occupancy with the test compound was calculated over untreated control. Occupancy 50 was calculated by fitting the dose response data to sigmoidal curve fitting equation using GraphPad Prism software V5.</p>Jurkat Cell Proliferation Assay:</p>Jurkat cells were seeded in a 96-well round-bottom plate and treated with varying concentration of compound. The final DMSO concentration was maintained at 0.1%. Compounds were screened in a 9-point dose response format starting with 10 \u03bcM and \u2153<sup>rd </sup>serial dilution. At the end of 72 h, cells were spun down and media was aspirated. 50 \u03bcL of XTT containing media was added to the wells. The plates were read using the M3 spectrophotometer at 465 nM. EC<sub>50 </sub>was calculated by fitting the dose response data to sigmoidal curve fitting equation using GraphPad Prism software V5.</p>Biochemical Assay for CDK12 (Kd Determination):</p>Kinase-tagged T7 phage strains were grown in parallel in 24-well blocks in an E. coli host derived from the BL21 strain. E. coli were grown to log-phase and infected with T7 phage from a frozen stock (multiplicity of infection=0.4) and incubated with shaking at 32\u00b0 C. until lysis (90-150 minutes). The lysates were centrifuged (6,000\u00d7g) and filtered (0.2 \u03bcm) to remove cell debris. The remaining kinases were produced in HEK-293 cells and subsequently tagged with DNA for qPCR detection. Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were treated with biotinylated small molecule ligands for 30 minutes at room temperature to generate affinity resins for kinase assays. The liganded beads were blocked with excess biotin and washed with blocking buffer (SeaBlock (Pierce), 1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, 1 mM DTT) to remove unbound ligand and to reduce non-specific phage binding. Binding reactions were assembled by combining kinases, liganded affinity beads, and test compounds in 1\u00d7 binding buffer (20% SeaBlock, 0.17\u00d7PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 6 mM DTT). Test compounds were prepared as 40\u00d7 stocks in 100% DMSO and directly diluted into the assay. All reactions were performed in polypropylene 384-well plates in a final volume of 0.02 ml. The assay plates were incubated at room temperature with shaking for 1 hour and the affinity beads were washed with wash buffer (1\u00d7PBS, 0.05% Tween 20). The beads were then re-suspended in elution buffer (1\u00d7PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.5 \u03bcM non-biotinylated affin",
    "m Prism 5.03 (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, Calif.).</p>Biochemical Assay for CDK7:</p>The inhibitory activity of the test compounds was assessed by the LANCE TR-FRET assay, which detects the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of an ULight-myelin basic protein (MBP) substrate peptide (100 nM) by CDK7 (10 nM). Briefly, the enzyme reaction was run in reaction buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Triton x, 100 \u03bcM Sodium Orthovanadate, 1 mM DTT). The assay was performed in 384-well plate. The end concentration of the ATP substrate was 1 mM/100 \u03bcM, and that of the ULight-MBP substrate peptide was 100 nM, and of CDK7 was 10 nM. Pre-incubation of the compound and enzyme was performed for 60 min at room temperature. After 60 min incubation at room temperature, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 40 mM EDTA and 1 nM Eu-labeled anti-phospho-MBP-binding protein antibody in the buffer. Time-resolved fluorescence (excitation, 320 nm; emission donor, 615 nm; emission acceptor, 665 nm) was monitored by using 2030 multilabel reader Victor5 (PerkinElmer). The readout was calculated as (acceptor counts/donor counts)\u00d71000. The IC<sub>50 </sub>values were derived by fitting a sigmoidal dose-response curve to a plot of assay readout over inhibitor concentration. All fits were computed with the program Prism 5.03 (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, Calif.).</p>Exemplary compounds of the present invention were screened by the above-mentioned assays and the results are tabulated; the Kd values of the selected compounds are set forth below in table-9 wherein \u201cA\u201d refers to a Kd value less than 0.025 \u03bcM, \u201cB\u201d refers to a Kd value in range of 0.025 \u03bcM to 0.1 \u03bcM and \u201cC\u201d refers to a Kd value greater than 0.1 \u03bcM.</p>TABLE 9Kd values for CDK12 activityCDK12 Kd (\u03bcM)Compound No.A4, 6, 10, 12-16, 20-21, 34-35 and 37.B1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 11, 18 and 36.C3, 7, 17 and 19.\nComparisons:\n</p>Compounds with greater selectivity are expected to provide a higher therapeutic index.
