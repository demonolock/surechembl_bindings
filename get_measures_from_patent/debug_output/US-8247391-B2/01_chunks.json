    "in from cross-linked dextran beads.</p>Finally, WO99/48419 describes the use of a viscosity-sensitive chip to measure the change of viscosity of a reversible gel (specifically a Ficoll-ConA gel) to determine the level of glucose in a sample to be analysed.</p>A problem of gels of this type is that they are water-miscible and hence are prone to dispersal. This problem becomes particularly acute if they are used in vivo to detect a particular analyte, because the components of the gel could cause an unwanted immune reaction: indeed, ConA is mitogenic. For this reason, the gels may be enclosed by a semi-permeable membrane which will allow passage of the analyte into contact with the gel. However, in order for the gel to react to changed levels of analyte within a reasonable time, the analyte must be able to pass quickly through the semi-permeable membrane. In addition, in those situations where a drug is to be released, the membrane must allow quick release. To ensure such quick passage, the membrane needs to have relatively large openings and/or be relatively thin, with the result that the components of the gel can leach through the semi-permeable membrane. For example, a gel of the type described in WO 93/13803 is water-miscible and must be confined in a small pore membrane to prevent rapid dispersal of the gel-forming components, especially in the sol form induced by raised levels of glucose. However, pore sizes (e.g. 0.1 \u03bcm) which are not rate-limiting for release of the 36 kD insulin hexamer still allow the 10 kD ConA tetramer and, to a lesser extent, dextran to escape.</p>It is therefore desirable to produce a gel of the type described above which is less prone to dispersal.</p>According to the present invention, there is provided a gel composition comprising first and second gel-forming moieties which bind reversibly to one another to form a gel, wherein said binding is sensitive to the level of an analyte, and either or both of the gel-forming moieties are attached to cross-linked particulate entities such that the interstices between the entities allow gel-sol and sol-gel transformation, and yet are not so small that the analyte cannot diffuse therethrough.</p>DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSThe following detailed description of the invention will be better understood when read in conjunction with the appended drawings. For the purpose of illustrating the invention, there are shown in the drawings, certain embodiment(s) which are presently preferred. It should be understood, however, that the invention is not limited to the precise arrangements and instrumentalities shown.</p>The invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:</p>FIG. 1 illustrates the polymerisation of methacrylate derivatives of dextran and con A;</p>FIG. 2 is a diagrammatic representation of a dextran-con A copolymer resulting from the polymerisation of methacrylate derivatives of dextran and con A;</p>FIG. 3 illustrates how a matrix can be formed when at least one of the compon"
