    "th a 6 : 4 mixture of methanol and acetic acid buffer (1% potassium acetate plus 3% acetic acid, pH 5), followed by elution with the same mixture to collect the fractions containing the active substance. The combined fractions were then concentrated under reduced pressure to dryness. The resulting solid was dissolved in a small amount of 80% methanol and the solution was subjected to desalting for removal of excess potassium acetate on a column of Sephadex LH-20 that was eluted with 80% methanol. The fractions containing the active substances were collected and concentrated under reduced pressure to dryness to give 994 mg of a pale yellow powder (IC<sub>50 =</sub> 9.5 ug/ml). The powder so obtained was passed through a column for High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) (product of Senshu Kagaku K.K.; Nucleosil 5 C<sub>18</sub> 20 \u00f8 x 300 m/m; flor rate: 8 ml/min) preliminary equilibrated with a 1 : 1 mixture of acetonitrile and acetic acid buffer (2% potassium acetate plus 6% acetic acid, pH 4), followed by elution with said equilibrating fluid to col- leet the fractions containing each of Plipastatin A and A<sub>2</sub>. The combined fractions were then concentrated to dryness and the resulting solids were desalted by the same method as used for desalting the eluate from the silanized silica gel column, thereby giving 542 mg of Plipastatin <sub>A1</sub> (IC<sub>50 </sub>) 2.1 pg/ml) as a colorless powder and 152 <sub>m</sub>g of <sub>Pl</sub>ipastatin <sub>A2</sub> (<sub>IC50 </sub>) 3.8 ug/ml), also a colorless powder.</p>The brown powder containing Group B (B<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>2</sub>) of the present invention obtained from the 90% n-propanol eluting fractions was also passed through a column of silanised silica gel (200 ml) preliminary filled with 40% methanol, followed by successive elution with 40% methanol (1.5 1) and 50% methanol (1.5 1) to collect the fractions containing the active substances. The combined fractions were then concentrated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in a small amount of 80% methanol and the resulting solution was passed through a column of Sephadex LH-20, followed by elution with 80% methanol to collect the fractions containing the active substances which were then concentrated to dryness to give 545 mg of a pale yellow powder (IC<sub>50 =</sub> 8 \u00b5g/ml). The powder so obtained was then passed through a column for HPLC (Nucleosil 5 C<sub>18</sub> 20 \u00f8 x 300 m/m; flow rate: 8 ml/min) preliminary equilibrated with a 65 : 35 mixture of acetonitrile and acetic acid buffer (2% potassium acetate plus 6% acetic acid, pH 4), followed by elution with said equilibrating fluid to collect the fractions containing each of Plipastatin <sub>B1</sub> and B<sub>2</sub>. The respective fractions were concentrated to dryness. The residues were desalted by eluting them with 80% methanol from a column of Sephadex LH-20 to give 151 mg of Plipastatin B<sub>1</sub> (IC<sub>50</sub> = 2.8 \u00b5g/ml) as a colorless powder and 89 mg "
