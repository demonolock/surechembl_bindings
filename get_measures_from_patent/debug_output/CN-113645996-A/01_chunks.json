    "allele, median OS was prolonged by 6.8 months in the margetuximab group compared to the trastuzumab group (Macrogenics press).</p>Glycoengineering strategies have also been used to develop therapeutic antibodies with optimized effector functions tailored to cancer treatment. It is well known that Fc \u03b3 R interacts with carbohydrates on the CH2 domain, and that the composition of these glycans has a significant impact on effector functional activity. The highly conserved glycans at position 297 of the Fc region indicate structural changes in the Fc region required for binding to Fc \u03b3 receptors. Subtle differences in glycan composition at this site can affect Fc structure and may also alter interactions with Fc \u03b3 R by direct contact. Perhaps the best example is a non-fucosylated antibody which shows increased binding to CD16A and shows significantly enhanced ADCC activity (Niwa, R et al, Clin. Cancer Res.10: 6248-6255(2004), Ferrara, C.et al, J.biol. chem 281: 5032-5036 (2006)).</p>The efficacy of therapeutic antibodies is critically dependent on appropriate post-translational modifications. In particular, glycosylation of antibody Fc is crucial for Fc receptor mediated activity. ADCC has been clinically established as an important mechanism of action for anti-cancer antibodies in the effector function of antibody therapy. It is well known in the art that the lack of IgG-Fc core fucose greatly increases binding to Fc \u03b3 RIIa (CD16a) and results in higher ADCC potency (e.g. lower EC50), a finding that has been successfully used to improve the efficacy of therapeutic antibodies. The glycoengineering strategy involves the production of antibodies under conditions that provide low or no fucosylation (e.g., non-fucosylated mabs) to enhance ADCC by increasing FcGRIIIa binding.</p>Those skilled in the art will recognize that BioWa/Kyowa Hakko Kirin and GlycArt/Roche have each developed a proprietary cell line that produces deglycosylated antibodies. To achieve this result, BioWa/Kyowa Kirin Hakko established an alpha-1, 6-fucosyltransferase (FUT8) enzyme knockout Chinese hamster ovary cell line (Technology), whereas GlycArt/Roche selects for overexpression of heterologous beta-1, 4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GlycoMab) in antibody-producing cells<sup>TM</sup>Technology, U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,684).</p>Glycosylated engineered antibodies with improved ADCC activity have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are currently marketed in the United states, including mogamulizumab (POTELIGEO)<sup>TM</sup>)\u3001obinutuzumab(GAZYVA<sup>TM</sup>) And benralizumab (FASENRA)<sup>TM</sup>). Mogamulizumab is a nonfucosylated anti-CCR 4 antibody using the POLELLIGENT developed by Biowa<sup>TM</sup>Technical platform, produced in cell line with mutant FUT8(a-1, 6-fucosyltransferase) gene. In mammals, most of the core fucosylation on N-glycans is formed through alpha-1, 6 bonds. FUT8 is the only alpha-1, 6 fucosyltransferase that catalyzes the transfe"
