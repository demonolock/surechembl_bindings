    " a helper-dependent or gutless adenovirus. In one embodiment, the vector can be a lentivirus. Methods for preparing genetically engineered neural stem cells and compositions thereof for therapeutic treatment have been described in U.S. patent Nos.: U.S. Pat. No. 7,393,526 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,655,224, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>In various embodiments of the compositions and methods described herein, the neural stem cells that can be used include, but are not limited to, human neural stem cells, mouse neural stem cells HSN-1 cells, fetal pig cells and neural crest cells, bone marrow derived neural stem cells, and hNT cells. HSN-1 cells can be prepared, for example, as described in, e.g., Ronnett et al. (Science 248, 603-605, 1990). The preparation of neural crest cells in described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,654,183. hNT cells can be prepared as described in, e.g, Konubu et al. (Cell Transplant 7, 549-558, 1998). In some embodiments of the compositions and methods described herein, the neural stem cells that can be used are neural stem cells derived or differentiated from a precursor stem cell, such as a human embryonic stem cell or an induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell. Such neural stem cells can be generated from or differentiated from human embryonic stem cells, using, for example, compositions and methods described in Nature Biotechnology 27, 275-280 (2009), \u201cHighly efficient neural conversion of human ES and iPS cells by dual inhibition of SMAD signaling,\u201d the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties. Such neural stem cells can be generated from or differentiated from iPS cells, using, for example, the compositions and methods described in US Patent Publication US 2010/0021437 A1, \u201cNEURAL STEM CELLS DERIVED FROM INDUCED PLURIPOTENT STEM CELLS,\u201d the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.</p>Accordingly, as used herein, \u201cneural stem cells\u201d refers to a subset of pluripotent cells which have partially differentiated along a neural cell pathway and express some neural markers including, for example, nestin. Neural stem cells can differentiate into neurons or glial cells (e.g., astrocytes and oligodendrocytes). Thus, \u201cneural stem cells derived or differentiated from iPS cells\u201d refers to cells that are pluripotent but have partially differentiated along a neural cell pathway (i.e., express some neural cell markers), and themselves are the result of in vitro or in vivo differentiation iPS cells.</p>Neural selection factors that can be used to differentiate pluripotent stem cells, such as embryonic stem cells or iPS cells into neural stem cells, include, for example, sonic hedgehog (SHH), fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), and fibroblast growth factor-8 (FGF-8), which can be used alone or in pairwise combination, or all three factors may be used together. In some embodiments, iPS cells are cultured in the presence of at least SHH and F",
    "ered to express or secrete a multimodal TRAIL agent using the methods as disclosed herein, that is sufficient to effect a particular effect when administered to a typical subject. An effective amount as used herein would also include an amount sufficient to delay the development of a symptom of the disease, alter the course of a symptom disease (for example but not limited to, slow the progression of a symptom of the disease), or reverse a symptom of the disease. Thus, it is not possible to specify the exact \u201ceffective amount\u201d. However, for any given case, an appropriate \u201ceffective amount\u201d can be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using only routine experimentation.</p>Effective amounts, toxicity, and therapeutic efficacy can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dosage can vary depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compositions and methods that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. A therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. Also, a dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the multimodal TRAIL agent), which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture, or in an appropriate animal model. Levels in plasma can be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography. The effects of any particular dosage can be monitored by a suitable bioassay. The dosage can be determined by a physician and adjusted, as necessary, to suit observed effects of the treatment.</p>Some aspects and embodiments disclosed herein can be illustrated by, for example any of the following numbered paragraphs:\n1. A multimodal TRAIL agent comprising a reporter module and a therapeutic TRAIL module, wherein said therapeutic TRAIL module comprises an extracellular domain of human TRAIL.2. The multimodal TRAIL agent of paragraph 1, wherein the extracellular domain of human TRAIL comprises amino acids 114-281 of SEQ ID NO: 1.3. The multimodal TRAIL agent of any one of paragraphs 1 or 2, further comprising a signal sequence.4. The multimodal TRAIL agent of paragraph 3, wherein the signal sequence comprises SEQ ID NO: 2.5. The multimodal TRAIL agent of any one of paragraphs 1-4, wherein the therapeutic TRAIL module further comprises an isoleucine zipper domain.6. The multimodal TRAIL agent of any one of paragraphs 1-5, further comprising a linker domain C-terminal to the reporter module and N-terminal to the therapeutic TRAIL module.7. The multimodal TRAIL agent of paragraph 6, wherein the linker domain comprises at least eight amino acids.8. The multimodal TRAIL agent of paragraph 6, wherein the li",
    "onstrated that NSC and human MSC migrate extensively throughout the murine brain and exhibit an inherent capacity to home to established gliomas (Sasportas et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci 2009, Shah et al Ann Neurol 2005, Shah et al. J Neurosci 2008). Stem cells armed with S-TRAIL inhibited progression of gliomas in a xenogenic transplant model (Sasportas et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci 2009, Shah et al Ann Neurol 2005); however, assessing the pharmacokinetics of the molecules released by therapeutic NSC has been difficult.</p>As described herein, the combination of SRLOL2TR and real-time imaging demonstrated the advantages of stem cell-based delivery. Noninvasive monitoring of SRLOL2TR pharmacokinetics revealed a markedly increased delivery time and reduced nonspecific biodistribution that culminated in effective reduction in tumor burden. In contrast, i.v. or intratumoral injection of SRLOL2TR resulted in rapid clearance, widespread biodistribution, and minimal effects on the tumor. The results provided herein permit the first real-time comparison of pharmacokinetics when therapies are delivered by stem cells or systemic administration.</p>The ability to serially monitor the level of therapeutic protein delivered by stem cells, such as NSCs, is critical to effective cell-based therapy. Longitudinal imaging of therapies permits confirmation of the initial levels delivered, permits confirmation of whether there is a need to increase dose by injection of additional therapeutic NSC should inhibition of tumor growth not be observed, or indicates the need for re-administration if the dose begins to decline. The examples shown herein of intracranial glioblastoma xenograft using the combination of mNSC and SRLOL2TR revealed robust and sustained delivery of TRAIL fusion as early as 2 days post-implantation and showed that sustained SRLOL2TR persisted through day 12. Importantly, the continuous delivery of SRLOL2TR by stem cells markedly decreased glioma burden as early as day 6. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of stem cell-mediated delivery of SRLOL2TR as an anti-glioma therapy, as significant tumor regression was achieved with a single administration of therapeutically engineered stem cells. In the event that SRLOL2TR levels decrease at time points beyond those described herein, the diagnostic functionality of SRLOL2TR would reveal these changes, and stem cells could be re-administered to ensure continued suppression of tumor growth.</p>In conclusion, shown herein is the engineering of novel fusion multimodal TRAIL agents with both diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities, and utilization of the novel multimodal TRAIL agent SRLOL2TR as a means to determine vital aspects of stem cell-based therapies. These studies showed, in part, how differences in delivery efficiency between different cell lines affected their therapeutic application, how improved pharmacokinetics mediated by stem cell delivery influenced anti-tumor efficacy of a therapy, and how se"
