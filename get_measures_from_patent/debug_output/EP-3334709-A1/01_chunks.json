    " \n\n To the cloudy solution of step 2 was added a mixture of 3 mg each of Compound I</p>3 polymorphs (Form II, III, Ilia, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII). </p> Stirred the slurry in the step 3 for 6 h at 25 \u00b0C: partial slurry was filtered and </p> 4 analyzed by XRPD, which showed Form I. </p> Stirred the slurry in the step 3 for 18 h at 25 \u00b0C: partial slurry was filtered and </p> 5 analyzed by XRPD, which showed Form I. </p>Example A: LSD1 histone demethylase biochemical assay </p> LANCE LSD1/KDM1A demethylase assay- 10 \u03bc\u03af of 1 nM LSD-1 enzyme (ENZO BML-SE544-0050) in the assay buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.01% Tween-20, 25 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT) were pre-incubated for 1 hour at 25 \u00b0C with 0.8 compound/DMSO dotted in black 384 well polystyrene plates. Reactions were started by addition of 10 of assay buffer containing 0.4 \u03bc\u039c Biotin-labeled Histone H3 peptide substrate: ART-K(Mel)- QTARKSTGGKAPRKQLA-GGK(Biotin) SEQ ID NO: l (AnaSpec 64355) and incubated for 1 hour at 25\u00b0C. Reactions were stopped by addition of 10 \u03bc\u03af IX LANCE Detection Buffer (PerkinElmer CR97- 100) supplemented with 1.5 nM Eu-anti-unmodified H3K4 Antibody (PerkinElmer TRF0404), and 225 nM LANCE Ultra Streptavidin (PerkinElmer TRF102) along with 0.9 mM Tranylcypromine-HCl (Millipore 616431). After stopping the reactions plates were incubated for 30 minutes and read on a PHERAstar FS plate reader (BMG Labtech). The salts of the present disclosure have been tested and found to be active against LSD1 with an IC50 less than 100 nM. </p> Various modifications of the invention, in addition to those described herein, will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing description. Such modifications are also intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims. Each reference, including without limitation all patent, patent applications, and publications, cited in the present application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. \n</p>"
