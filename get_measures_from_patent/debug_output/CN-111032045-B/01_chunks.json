Nos. 62/673,526 and 62/673,533, both filed 5/18 in 2018. The present application also claims the priority benefits of international patent application PCT/CN2017/097496 filed on 15 th 8 th 2017. Each of the above-identified priority applications is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>Background</p>Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency (PKD) is a red blood cell disease caused by a deficiency of the enzyme Pyruvate Kinase R (PKR) due to a recessive Mutation of the PKLR gene (Wijk et al Human Mutation,2008,30 (3) 446-453). PKR activators may be beneficial in treating PKD, thalassemia (e.g., beta-thalassemia), hereditary elliptically-shaped erythromatosis, non-beta lipoproteinemia or Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome, sickle cell disease, paroxysmal sleep-related hemoglobinuria, anaemia (e.g., congenital anaemia (e.g., enzymopathy), hemolytic anaemia (e.g., hereditary and/or congenital hemolytic anaemia, acquired hemolytic anaemia, chronic hemolytic anaemia caused by phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency, chronic anaemia, non-spherical erythrolymic anaemia, or hereditary spherical erythromatosis). </p>Disclosure of Invention</p>Described herein are compounds of formulae (I), (II), (III), (IV) and (V) (collectively referred to herein as \"formulae (I) - (V)\") and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof that activate Pyruvate Kinase R (PKR) wild-type and/or mutant enzymes, such as those described herein.</p>In one embodiment, the present invention provides a compound of formula (I):</p></p>wherein R is <sup>1</sup> \u3001R <sup>2</sup> \u3001R <sup>a</sup> \u3001R <sup>b</sup> \u3001R <sup>j</sup> \u3001R <sup>k</sup> And Q is as defined herein.</p>In one embodiment, the compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is selected from the compounds in table 1 or fig. 1.</p>Also provided are pharmaceutical compositions comprising compounds of formulas (I) - (V), or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</p>The present disclosure also provides a method of treating anemia in a subject comprising administering to the subject an ",

In certain embodiments, the PKD is PKR deficiency. In certain embodiments, the PKR deficiency is associated with a pyruvate kinase R mutation.</p>The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions described herein are PKR activators that have lower activity than the wild type and are therefore useful in the methods of the present disclosure. In certain embodiments, the PKR is wild-type. In certain embodiments, the PKR is a mutant. Such mutations in PKR may affect enzyme activity (catalytic efficiency), regulatory properties (through fructose diphosphate (FBP)/ATP regulation), and/or thermostability of the enzyme. Examples of such mutations are described in Valentin et al, JBC 2002. Some examples of mutants activated by the compounds described herein include G332S, G364D, T384M, R479H, R479K, R486W, R532W, K410E, R Q and R490W. Without being limited by theory, in certain embodiments, the compounds described herein affect the activity of PKR mutants by: activating FBP non-responsive PKR mutants, restoring thermostability of mutants with reduced stability, or restoring catalytic efficiency of impaired mutants. The activation activity of the compounds of the invention for PKR mutants can be tested in accordance with the methods described in the examples. In certain embodiments, the compounds described herein are also activators of wild-type PKR. </p>In one embodiment, the present disclosure provides a method of activating PKR in erythrocytes in a subject in need thereof, comprising administering to the subject a",

The term \"therapeutically effective amount\" may comprise an amount that improves overall treatment, reduces or avoids symptoms, signs, or etiologies of the disorder, and/or enhances the therapeutic efficacy of another therapeutic agent. In certain embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount is an amount sufficient to cause measurable activation of wild-type or mutant PKR. In certain embodiments, the therapeutically effective amount is an amount as follows: which is sufficient to modulate 2, 3-diphosphoglycerate and/or ATP levels in blood in need thereof or for the treatment of Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency (PKD), hemolytic anemia (e.g., chronic hemolytic anemia, hereditary non-spherical erythrocyte anemia), sickle cell disease, thalassemia (e.g., beta-thalassemia), hereditary spherical erythromatosis, hereditary elliptical erythromatosis, non-beta lipoproteinemia (or Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome), paroxysmal sleep hemoglobinuria, acquired hemolytic anemia (e.g., congenital anemia (e.g., enzyme disease)), chronic anemia, or for the treatment of diseases or conditions associated with elevated 2, 3-diphosphoglycerate levels (e.g., liver disease).

In one aspect, the therapeutically effective amount is the amount required to produce a hemoglobin response in a subject as follows: the Hb concentration increases from baseline by \u22611.0g/dL (such as \u22611.5g/dL or \u22612.0 g/dL). The baseline Hb concentration of a subject is the average of all available Hb concentrations over at least 2 weeks (e.g., 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, or 6 weeks) prior to treatment with a compound described herein. In certain aspects, the therapeutically effective amount is an amount required to reduce the infusion burden on the patient. In one aspect, the therapeutically effective amount is 0.01-100mg/kg body weight/day of the provided compound, such as, for example, 0.1-100mg/kg body weight/day.
