    "and/or glycoslylated) to improve the binding affinity of the inhibitor, to improve the ability of the inhibitor to be transported across a cell membrane or to improve stability. As a specific example, for inhibitors in which the third residue from the C-terminus is S or T, this residue can be phosphorylated before use of the peptide.</p>Peptides of the invention, optionally fused to internalization domains, can be synthesized by solid phase synthesis or recombinant methods. Peptidomimetics can be synthesized using a variety of procedures and methodologies described in the scientific and patent literature, e.g., Organic Syntheses Collective Volumes, Gilman et al. (Eds) John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., NY, al-Obeidi (1998) Mol. Biotechnol. 9:205-223; Hruby (1997) Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1:114-119; Ostergaard (1997) Mol. Divers. 3:17-27; Ostresh (1996) Methods Enzymol. 267:220-234.</p>Peptides of the invention without an internalization peptide usually have 3-25 amino acids, Peptide lengths (also without an internalization peptide) of 5-10 amino acids, and particularly 9 amino acids are preferred.</p>Appropriate pharmacological activity of peptides or peptidomimetics can be confirmed, if desired, using the animal model described in the Examples. Optionally, peptides or peptidomimetics can also be screened for capacity to inhibit interactions between PSD-95 and NMDAR 2B using assays described in e.g., US 20050059597, which is incorporated by reference. Useful peptides typically have IC50 values of less than 50 uM, 25 \u03bcM, 0.1 \u03bcM or 0.01 \u03bcM in such an assay. Preferred peptides typically have an IC50 value of between 0.001-1 \u03bcM, and more preferably 0.05-0.5 or 0.05 to 0.1 \u03bcM</p>Peptides such as those just described can optionally be derivatized (e.g., acetylated, phosphorylated and/or glycoslylated) to improve the binding affinity of the inhibitor, to improve the ability of the inhibitor to be transported across a cell membrane or to improve stability. As a specific example, for inhibitors in which the third residue from the C-terminus is S or T, this residue can be phosphorylated before use of the peptide.</p>Agents also include small molecules that inhibit interactions between PSD95 and NMDAR 2B, and/or other interactions described above. Suitable small-molecule inhibitors are described in co-pending International Application No. PCT/US2006/062715, which was filed on 29 Dec., 2005, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. These molecules were identified by in silico screening of a compound library for binding to PSD95, and binding of exemplary compounds was verified experimentally. Suitable compounds include compounds having the general structure of P<sub>0</sub>-A-B-C-D-E, where D and E are optional, and P<sub>0 </sub>is:</p><img id=\"EMI-C00001\" path=\"US20120083449A1-20120405-C00001.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/185988345/US/20120405/A1/020120/08/34/49/US20120083449A1-20120405-C00001.TIF\"/>wherein one of R<sup>1</sup>, R<sup>2</sup>, R<sup>3</sup>, R<sup>4</sup>, and R<sup>5 </sup>is \u2014COOH, and wherein the remainder of R<sup>1</s"
