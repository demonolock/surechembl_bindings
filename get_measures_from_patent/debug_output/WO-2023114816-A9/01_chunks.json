    "% identity with SEQ ID NO: 3 (hGALCopt2). </p>[0082] Treatment may, for example, be affected to increase levels of galactosylceramidase in the subject. </p>[0083] In some embodiments, provided herein are methods for treating PPMS in patients in need thereof, who have been identified as having at least one of the following single nucleotide polymorphisms in human GALC gene: D248N, I562T, or R184C, or any combination thereof. D248N, I562T, and R184C are relatively common polymorphisms within the human GALC gene that are found at similar frequencies in the PPMS population as compared to the general population. In certain instances, these polymorphisms have been shown to independently decrease GALC activity by reducing lysosomal GALC protein levels, but not to the extent of a pathogenic mutation (T112A is an example of a pathogenic mutation). \n\n[0084] It is believed that the I562T GALC polymorphism is consistently associated with a statistically significant worse clinical severity across multiple analysis models and subpopulations of PPMS. </p>[0085] Additionally, provided herein are methods for treating PPMS or related conditions in patients with any GALC mutation/s that reduce GALC activity or levels compared with baseline or normal GALC activity or levels, either with or without known polymorphisms in GALC. </p>[0086] Recent data has shown that brain tissue psychosine levels were lower in younger (&lt; 2y/o) controls as compared to similarly-aged subjects with Krabbe disease (KD). Adult control (age: 40 y/o) had brain tissue psychosine levels comparable to an age-matched subject with late-onset KD. Thus, age-related reduction in GALC activity may be a driver of increased psychosine levels later in life. </p>Modified Nucleic Acid for Expression of GALC </p>[0087] \u201cOptimized\u201d or \u201ccodon-optimized\u201d as referred to interchangeably herein, refer to a coding sequence that has been optimized relative to a wild type coding sequence (e.g., a coding sequence for galactosylceramidase) to increase expression of the coding sequence, e.g., by minimizing usage of rare codons, decreasing the number of CpG dinucleotides, removing cryptic splice donor or acceptor sites, removing Kozak sequences, removing ribosomal entry sites, and the like. </p>[0088] \u201c Codon adaptation index\u201d as used herein, refers to the adaption of a codon from a tRNA codon that rarely occurs within the given organism or cell to a tRNA that occurs more often within the given organism or cell. A non-limiting example in which the codon adaptation index is calculated is by using the \u201cGenScript Rare Codon Analysis Tool.\u201d (genscript, com/tool s/rare-codon-analy si s). </p>[0089] \u201cPercentage identity\u201d as used herein, refers to the numerical score of two given polynucleotides and/or polypeptides that have identical nucleic and/or amino acids within the same position as given by a typical sequence alignment program (/.&lt;?. BLAST methods).</p>Codon Optimization </p>[0090] There are sixty-four different codons. Sixty-one of them encode the twenty standard amino acids, while another three function as stop codons.
