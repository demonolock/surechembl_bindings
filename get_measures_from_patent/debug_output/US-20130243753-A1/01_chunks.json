DefinitionsAn \u201cacceptor human framework\u201d for the purposes herein is a framework comprising the amino acid sequence of a light chain variable domain (VL) framework or a heavy chain variable domain (VH) framework derived from a human immunoglobulin framework or a human consensus framework, as defined below. An acceptor human framework \u201cderived from\u201d a human immunoglobulin framework or a human consensus framework may comprise the same amino acid sequence thereof, or it may contain amino acid sequence changes. In some embodiments, the number of amino acid changes are 10 or less, 9 or less, 8 or less, 7 or less, 6 or less, 5 or less, 4 or less, 3 or less, or 2 or less. In some embodiments, the VL acceptor human framework is identical in sequence to the VL human immunoglobulin framework sequence or human consensus framework sequence.</p>\u201cAffinity\u201d refers to the strength of the sum total of noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g., an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, \u201cbinding affinity\u201d refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1:1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., antibody and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (Kd). Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art, including those described herein. Specific illustrative and exemplary embodiments for measuring binding affinity are described in the following.</p>An \u201caffinity matured\u201d antibody refers to an antibody with one or more alterations in one or more hypervariable regions (HVRs), compared to a parent antibody which does not possess such alterations, such alterations resulting in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen.</p>An \u201cangiogenic disorder\u201d refers to any dysregulation of angiogenesis, including both non-neoplastic and neoplastic conditions. Neoplastic conditions include but are not limited those described below (see, e.g., \u201cCancer\u201d). Non-neoplastic disorders include but are not limited to undesired or aberrant hypertrophy, arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, psoriatic plaques, sarcoidosis, atherosclerosis, atherosclerotic plaques, diabetic and other proliferative retinopathies including retinopathy of prematurity, retrolental fibroplasia, neovascular glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema, corneal neovascularization, corneal graft neovascularization, corneal graft rejection, retinal/choroidal neovascularization, neovascularization of the angle (rubeosis), ocular neovascular disease, vascular restenosis, arteriovenous malformations (AVM), meningioma, hemangioma, angiofibroma, thyroid hyperplasias (including Grave's disease), corneal and other tissue tra",

An anti-angiogenic agent may, for instance, be a small molecule or antibody that binds to a growth factor or growth factor receptor involved in promoting angiogenesis. In one embodiment, an anti-angiogenic agent is an antibody that binds to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), such as bevacizumab (AVASTIN\u00ae).</p>The terms \u201canti-Axl antibody\u201d and \u201can antibody that binds to Axl\u201d refer to an antibody that is capable of binding Axl with sufficient affinity such that the antibody is useful as a diagnostic and/or therapeutic agent in targeting Axl. In one embodiment, the extent of binding of an anti-Axl antibody to an unrelated, non-Axl protein is less than about 10% of the binding of the antibody to Axl as measured, e.g., by a radioimmunoassay (RIA). In certain embodiments, an antibody that binds to Axl has a dissociation constant (Kd) of \u22661 \u03bcM, \u2266100 nM, \u226610 nM, \u22661 nM, \u22660.1 nM, \u22660.01 nM, or \u22660.001 nM (e.g. 10<sup>\u22128</sup>M or less, e.g. from 10<sup>\u22128</sup>M to 10<sup>\u221213</sup>M, e.g., from 10<sup>\u22129</sup>M to 10<sup>\u221213 </sup>M). In certain embodiments, an anti-Axl antibody binds to an epitope of Axl that is conserved among Axl from different species.</p>The term \u201cantibody\u201d herein is used in the broadest sense and encompasses various antibody structures, including but not limited to monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies), and antibody fragments so long as they exhibit the desired antigen-binding activity.</p>An \u201cantibody fragment\u201d refers to a molecule other than an intact antibody that comprises a portion of an intact antibody that binds the antigen to which the intact antibody binds. Examples of antibody fragments include but are not limited to Fv, Fab, Fab\u2032, Fab\u2032-SH, F(ab\u2032)<sub>2</sub>; diabodies; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody molecules (e.g. scFv); and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.</p>An \u201cantibody that binds to the same epitope\u201d as a reference antibody refers to an antibody that blocks binding of the reference antibody to its antigen in a competition assay by 50% or more, and conversely, the reference antibody blocks binding of the antibody to its antigen in a competition assay by 50% or more. An exemplary competition assay is provided herein.</p>The term \u201cAxl,\u201d as used herein, refers to any native Ax",

In certain embodiments, an antibody is provided that competes for binding to human Axl with an anti-Axl antibody comprising a VH sequence of SEQ ID NO:107 and a VL sequence of SEQ ID NO:108.</p>In a further aspect of the invention, an anti-Axl antibody according to any of the above embodiments is a monoclonal antibody, including a chimeric, humanized or human antibody. In one embodiment, an anti-Axl antibody is an antibody fragment, e.g., a Fv, Fab, Fab\u2032, scFv, diabody, or F(ab\u2032)<sub>2 </sub>fragment. In another embodiment, the antibody is a full length antibody, e.g., an intact IgG antibody or other antibody class or isotype as defined herein.</p>In a further aspect, an anti-Axl antibody according to any of the above embodiments may incorporate any of the features, singly or in combination, as described in Sections 1-7 below:</p>1. Antibody Affinity</p>In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein has a dissociation constant (Kd) of \u22661 \u03bcM, \u2266100 nM, \u226610 nM, \u22661 nM, \u22660.1 nM, \u22660.01 nM, or \u22660.001 nM (e.g. 10<sup>\u22128</sup>M or less, e.g. from 10<sup>\u22128</sup>M to 10<sup>\u221213</sup>M, e.g., from 10<sup>\u22129</sup>M to 10<sup>\u221213 </sup>M).</p>In one embodiment, Kd is measured by a radiolabeled antigen binding assay (RIA) performed with the Fab version of an antibody of interest and its antigen as described by the following assay. Solution binding affinity of Fabs for antigen is measured by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of (<sup>125</sup>I)-labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen, then capturing bound antigen with an anti-Fab antibody-coated plate (see, e.g., Chen et al., J. Mol. Biol. 293:865-881 (1999)). To establish conditions for the assay, MICROTITER\u00ae multi-well plates (Thermo Scientific) are coated overnight with 5 \u03bcg/ml of a capturing anti-Fab antibody (Cappel Labs) in 50 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.6), and subsequently blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature (approximately 23\u00b0 C.). In a non-adsorbent plate (Nunc #269620), 100 pM or 26 pM [<sup>125</sup>I]-antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest (e.g., consistent with assessment of the anti-VEGF antibody, Fab-12, in Presta et al., Cancer Res. 57:4593-4599 (1997)). The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight; however, the incubation may continue for a longer period (e.g., about 65 hours) to ensure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter, the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature (e.g., for one hour). The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1% polysorbate 20 (TWEEN-20\u00ae) in PBS. When the plates have dried, 150 \u03bcl/well of scintillant (MICROSCINT-20\u2122; Packard) is added, and the plates are counted on a TOPCOUNT\u2122 gamma counter (Packard) for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20% of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays.</p>According to another embodiment, Kd is measured using surface plasmon resonance assays using a BIACORE\u00ae-2000 or a BIACORE\u00ae-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) at 25\u00b0 C. with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at \u02dc10 response units (RU). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIACORE, Inc.) are activated with N-ethyl-N\u2032-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, to 5 \u03bcg/ml (\u02dc0.2 \u03bcM) before injection at a flow rate of 5 \u03bcl/minute to achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen, 1 M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% polysorbate 20 (TWEEN-20\u2122) surfactant (PBST) at 25\u00b0 C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 \u03bcl/min. Association rates (k<sub>on</sub>) and dissociation rates (k<sub>off</sub>) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIACORE\u00ae Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneously fitting the association and dissociation sensorgrams. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) is calculated as the ratio k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>. See, e.g., Chen et al., J. Mol. Biol. 293:865-881 (1999). If the on-rate exceeds 10<sup>6 </sup>M<sup>\u22121 </sup>s<sup>\u22121 </sup>by the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation=295 nm; emission=340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25\u00b0 C. of a 20 nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow equipped spectrophometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-AMINCO\u2122 spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stirred cuvette.</p>2. Antibody Fragments</p>In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein is an antibody fragment. Antibody fragments include, but are not limited to, Fab, Fab\u2032, Fab\u2032-SH, F(ab\u2032)<sub>2</sub>, Fv, and scFv fragments, and other fragments described below. For a review of certain antibody fragments, see Hudson et al. Nat. Med. 9:129-134 (2003).

Cells were washed twice in PBS, and stained with anti-mouse Ig-PE. Samples were analyzed on BD FACScalibur Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences) as described above for FACS analysis.</p>ResultsGeneration of a Phage Derived Monoclonal Antibody that Blocks Axl Function.</p>To identify antibodies that cross-react with murine and human Axl, we employed phage-displayed antibody libraries with synthetic diversities in the selected complementary determining regions, mimicking the natural diversity of human IgG antibodies (Lee et al, 2004). Phage antibodies that bound to both human and murine Axl ECD were identified by ELISA and DNA sequencing, and antibody clones were reformatted to express full-length IgGs (Liang et al, 2007). A panel of full length IgGs was then screened for their ability to inhibit Gas6-dependent growth of Baf3Axl cells (Li et al, 2009), and one of the clones YW327.6 was affinity matured and purified.</p>Affinity matured Axl mAb YW327.652 binds to both human and murine Axl with high affinity, with a Kd of about 1 nM, and 545 pM, respectively (FIG. 7A-B).Specifically, Ka was 1.7\u00d710<sup>5</sup>, kd was 1.7\u00d710<sup>4</sup>, and KD was 9.9\u00d710<sup>\u221210</sup>. This antibody also binds to cynomolgus Axl, but it does not cross-react with related receptors Tyro3 and Mer (FIG. 7C). YW327.652 blocks binding of ligand Gas6 to Axl as demonstrated in both a cell free ELISA and on cell surface by FACS, in a dose-dependent manner (FIG. 7D-E).</p>Affinity matured Axl Mabs YW327.6511, YW327.4258 and YW327.42531 were also characterized. YW327.6511, YW327.4258 and YW327.42531 bind both human and murine Axl with high affinity. For example, biacore analysis of antibody binding to human Axl resulted in the following:</p>Hu AxlKakdKDYW327.6S111.7 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup>1.7 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup>1.3 \u00d7 10<sup>9</sup>YW327.42S85.2. \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup>\u20091.3 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup>2.5 \u00d7 10<sup>9</sup>YW327.42S316.3 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup>1.5 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup>2.4 \u00d7 10<sup>9</sup></p>These antibodies do not cross-react with Tyro3 and Mer. YW327.652 (and parent antibody YW 327.6) blocks binding of ligand Gas6 to Axl, while YW327.4258 and YW327.42531 (and parent Mab YW327.42) do not block binding of ligand Gas6 to Axl.</p>Axl Epitope Analysis.</p>Axl antibody binding to various portions of human Axl extracellular domain was analyzed using ELISA. The results were obtained.</p>YW327.6YW327.42Axl2 (aa1-134)+\u2212Axl-3 (aa1-221)+\u2212Axl-4 (aa1-324)++</p>YW327.6 bound to Axl-Fc fusions comprising amino acids 1-134 of human Axl. By contrast, YW327.42 bound an Axl-Fc fusion comprising amino acids 1-324 of human Axl, but did not bind Axl Fc fusions comprising amino acids 1-13",
    "ibodies YW326.6 and YW327.42 could compete for human Axl binding with anti-Axl hybridoma antibodies 12A11 and 3G9 (L1, (2009), U.S. patent application No. 61/228,915 filed Jul. 27, 2009). In antibody competition binding experiments to human Axl, Antibody YW327.6 did not compete for human Axl binding with either of hybridoma antibodies 12A11 or 3G9, demonstrating that these antibodies do not recognize the same epitopes. Antibody YW327.42 competed for human Axl binding with hybridoma antibody 12A11, but did not compete for human Axl binding with hybridoma antibody 3G9.</p>YW327.6S2 Down Regulates Axl Expression, Inhibits its Activation, Signaling and Gas6-Dependent Baf3Axl Cell Proliferation.</p>To test whether YW327.652 affects Axl biological functions, we first evaluated its effect on Axl expression and signaling. Treatment of NSCLC cell line A549 with YW327.652 resulted in rapid down-regulation of Axl expression on cell surface (FIG. 7F, upper panel) and this down regulation is sustained for 24 hrs (FIG. 7F, lower panel). Gas6 treatment of H1299 NSCLC cells induces Axl phosphorylation that was inhibited when cells were pre-incubated with YW327.652 (FIG. 7G, upper panel). Consequently, pre-incubation of H1299 cells with YW327.652 blocks Gas6-induced phosphorylation of the down-stream signaling molecule Akt (FIG. 7G, lower panel). Down-regulation of Axl expression and inactivation of its signaling by YW327.652 potently inhibited Gas6-dependent growth of Baf3Axl cells, with an IC50 of 340 ng/ml (FIG. 7H).</p>YW327.6S2 Reduces A549 Xenograft Growth and Enhances the Effect of Anti-VEGF.</p>In a previous study, we showed that inhibition of Axl by either RNAi or treatment with anti-human Axl hybridoma monoclonal antibodies significantly attenuated A549 NSCLC tumor growth (Li et al, 2009). We therefore first tested the effect of YW327.652 on tumor growth in this model. YW327.652 alone at 10 mg/kg, twice a week dosing regimen significantly reduced A549 tumor growth (FIG. 8A), and this inhibitory effect is comparable to that of anti-human Axl hybridoma antibodies (FIG. 8C).</p>Axl is expressed on endothelial cells and enhances VEGF-induced endothelial tubule formation (Li et al, 2009; Holland et al, 2005); we tested whether anti-Axl mAb could enhance the anti-tumor growth property of anti-VEGF (Liang et al, 2006). Anti-VEGF antibody alone and YW327.6S2 alone had similar effects on A549 tumor growth (FIG. 8A). Combination of the two antibodies together resulted in enhanced tumor growth inhibition compared with either antibody alone, with 30% inhibition by single agent versus 60% inhibition by the combination treatment (FIG. 8A).</p>Animals in this study were dosed twice weekly for 60 days and followed to day 85 to examine the delay in tumor growth (animals were removed from the study when tumor sizes exceeded 800 mm<sup>3</sup>; no animals were removed as a result of toxicity). YW327.6S2 in combination with anti-VEGF significantly delayed tumor growth as c"
