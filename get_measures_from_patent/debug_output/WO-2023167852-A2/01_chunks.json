The extent of concentration in initial concentration may be optimized to balance throughput and protein stability. </p><p id=\"p0497\" num=\"0497\">[0444] During the diafiltration stage, permeable solutes are replaced as new buffer is washed into the product stream. When new buffer is added at the same rate as permeate is removed from the system, the sum of the retentate tank and skid volume defines the system volume. One turn-over volume (TOV) is defined as an amount of diafiltration buffer added to the UF/DF process, and matches the system volume. Typically, replacement of 8-times system volume (8 TOV) assures &gt; 99.9% buffer exchange. The diafiltration buffer is intended to condition the protein to a stable pH and excipient concentration that compensates for high product concentration. \n<!-- EPO <DP n=\"129\"/>-->\n[0445] Once adequate buffer exchange has taken place, secondary concentration further reduces product volume to facilitate storage and formulation. If additional reduction in product volume is required, for example due to plant fit considerations, higher final protein concentration requirements, or required adjustment with viscosity modulators, final concentration is performed. </p><p id=\"p0498\" num=\"0498\">[0446] One of ordinary skill in the art can select an appropriate membrane filter device for the UF/DF operation. Examples of membrane cassettes suitable for the present invention include, but are not limited to, Pellicon 2 or Pellicon 3 cassettes with 10 kD, 30 kD or 50 kD membranes from EMD Millipore, Kvick 10 kD, 30 kD or 50 kD membrane cassettes from Cytiva, and Centramate or Centrasette 10 kD, 30 kD or 50 kD cassettes from Pall Corporation. </p><p id=\"p0499\" num=\"0499\">[0447] Exemplary steps are described in more detail here. A first UF/DF step comprises a WFI flush, with a volume of about 12 L/m<sup>2</sup> with respect to the retentate and 40 L/m<sup>2</sup> with respect to the permeate. A feed flowrate is between about 200 and 300 L/hr/m<sup>2</sup> (LMH), with a pressure of about 25 \u00b1 5 psi. Next, a pre-use leak test is performed with WFI, with an inlet pressure of 8- 12 psi. Equilibration is then performed with about 4 mM acetate at about pH 4.10 \u00b1 0.10. A volume of equilibration buffer is greater than or about 5 L/m<sup>2</sup>, and the flowrate is between about 200 and 300 LMH. </p><p id=\"p0500\" num=\"0500\">[0448] The sample to be concentrated (load) is then adjusted for compatibility with the final drug substance composition. A load adjustment solution may be, for example, about 10% (w/v) super refined polysorbate 80 or polysorbate 20, added as about 50 pL/L of load. </p><p id=\"p0501\" num=\"0501\">[0449] Next, the initial concentration step is performed with the load, for example a VRF pool. The load is added at a volume of about or less than 970 g/m<sup>2</sup>, with a flowrate of between about 200 and about 350 LMH, and a pressure of about 20 \u00b1 10 psi. In an exemplary embodiment, a flow rate is about 300 LMH. A protein concentration after initial concentration may be between about 60 and 80 g/L. In an exemplary embodiment, a protein concentration at this step is about 7",
