    "s a mouse, have been grafted onto human framework sequences. Additional framework region modifications may be made within the human framework sequences.</p>By the phrase \u201cspecifically binds,\u201d as used herein, is meant a compound, e.g., a protein, a nucleic acid, an antibody, and the like, which recognizes and binds a specific molecule, but does not substantially recognize or bind other molecules in a sample. For instance, an antibody or a peptide inhibitor which recognizes and binds a cognate ligand (e.g., an anti-IgE antibody that binds with its cognate antigen, IgE) in a sample, but does not substantially recognize or bind other molecules in the sample. Thus, under designated assay conditions, the specified binding moiety (e.g., an antibody or an antigen-binding portion thereof) binds preferentially to a particular target molecule, e.g., IgE, and does not bind in a significant amount to other components present in a test sample. A variety of assay formats may be used to select an antibody that specifically binds a molecule of interest. For example, solid-phase ELISA immunoassay, immunoprecipitation, BIAcore, FACS, and Western blot analysis are among many assays that may be used to identify an antibody that specifically reacts with IgE. Typically, a specific or selective reaction will be at least twice background signal or noise and more typically more than 10 times background, even more specifically, an antibody is said to \u201cspecifically bind\u201d an antigen when the equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) is \u22641 \u03bcM, preferably \u2264100 nM and most preferably \u226410 nM.</p>The term \u201cbinding affinity\u201d is herein used as a measure of the strength of a non-covalent interaction between two molecules, e.g., and antibody, or fragment thereof, and an antigen. The term \u201cbinding affinity\u201d is used to describe monovalent interactions (intrinsic activity).</p>Binding affinity between two molecules, e.g. an antibody, or fragment thereof, and an antigen, through a monovalent interaction may be quantified by determination of the dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>). In turn, K<sub>D </sub>can be determined by measurement of the kinetics of complex formation and dissociation, e.g. by the SPR method (Biacore). The rate constants corresponding to the association and the dissociation of a monovalent complex are referred to as the association rate constants ka (or k<sub>on</sub>) and dissociation rate constant k<sub>d </sub>(or k<sub>off</sub>), respectively. K<sub>D </sub>is related to ka and k<sub>d </sub>through the equation K<sub>D</sub>=k<sub>d</sub>/k<sub>a</sub>.</p>Following the above definition binding affinities associated with different molecular interactions, e.g. comparison of the binding affinity of different antibodies for a given antigen, may be compared by comparison of the K<sub>D </sub>values for the individual antibody/antigen complexes.</p>Similarly, the specificity of an interaction may be assessed by determination and comparison of the K<sub>D </sub>value for the interaction of interest, e.g. a specific interaction between an antibody and an antigen, with the K<sub>D </sub>value of an interaction not of interest.</p>The term \u201ck<sub>on</sub>\u201d, as used herein, is intended to refer to the on-rate, or association rate of a particular antibody-antigen or receptor-ligand interaction, whereas the term \u201ck<sub>off</sub>,\u201d as used herein, is intended to refer to the off-rate, or dissociation rate of a particular antibody-antigen/receptor-ligand interaction. The term \u201cK<sub>D</sub>\u201d, as used herein, is intended to refer to the dissociation constant, which is obtained from the ratio of k<sub>off </sub>to k<sub>on </sub>(i.e., k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>) and is expressed as a molar concentration (M). K<sub>D </sub>values for antibodies or other binding partners can be determined using methods well established in the art. One method for determining the K<sub>D </sub>is by using surface plasmon resonance, typically using a biosensor system such as a Biacore\u00ae system.</p>The term \u201cchimeric antibody\u201d as used herein means an antibody that comprises regions from two or more different antibodies. In certain embodiments a \u201cchimeric antibody\u201d comprises variable region sequences derived from one species and constant region sequences derived from another species, such as an antibody in which the variable region sequences are derived from a mouse antibody and the constant region sequences are derived from a human antibody. In one embodiment, one or more of the CDRs are derived from a mouse anti-human tumor antigen antibody. In another embodiment, all of the CDRs are derived from a mouse anti-human tumor antigen antibody. In another embodiment, the CDRs from more than one mouse anti-human tumor antigen antibodies are combined in a chimeric human antibody. For instance, a chimeric antibody may comprise a CDR1 from the light chain of a first mouse anti-human tumor antigen antibody, a CDR2 from the light chain of a second mouse anti-human tumor antigen antibody and a CDR3 and CDR3 from the light chain of a third ",
    "olypeptide. Thus, one of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate once armed with the teachings provided herein, that the invention is not limited to engineered antibodies, but rather, the invention encompasses an engineered Fc polypeptide fused with any binding domain providing specificity for a target of interest.</p>In other embodiments, the disclosure provides fusion proteins comprising an engineered Fc polypeptide that comprises at least one or more substitutions at positions selected from: 246, 249, 265, 267, 270, 276, 278, 283, 292, 293, 294, 300, 302, 303, 314, 315, 318, 320, 332, 333, 334, 336, 345, 347, 354, 355, 358, 360, 362, 370, 373, 376, 378, 380, 382, 386, 388, 390, 392, 393, 401, 404, 411, 413, 414, 416, 418, 419, 421, 428, 431, 432, 437, 438, 439, 443, and 444, wherein the numbering system of the constant region is that of the EU index as set forth in Kabat, fused to another protein.</p>Antibody Affinity</p>Typically, the K<sub>D </sub>for the antibody with respect to the target will be 2-fold, preferably 5-fold, more preferably 10-fold less than the K<sub>D </sub>with respect to another, non-target molecule such as, but not limited to, unrelated material or accompanying material in the environment. More preferably, the K<sub>D </sub>will be 50-fold less, such as 100-fold less, or 200-fold less; even more preferably 500-fold less, such as 1,000-fold less, or 10,000-fold less than the K<sub>D </sub>with respect the non-target molecule.</p>The value of this dissociation constant can be determined directly by well-known methods, and can be computed even for complex mixtures by methods such as those, for example, set forth in Caceci et al., 1984, Byte 9: 340-362. For example, the K<sub>D </sub>may be established using a double-filter nitrocellulose filter binding assay such as that disclosed by Wong and Lohman, 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 5428-5432. Other standard assays to evaluate the binding ability of ligands such as antibodies towards targets are known in the art, including for example, ELISAs, Western blots, RIAs, and flow cytometry analysis. The binding kinetics and binding affinity of the antibody also can be assessed by standard assays known in the art, such as Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), e.g. by using a Biacore\u2122 system.</p>A competitive binding assay can be conducted in which the binding of the antibody to the target is compared to the binding of the target by another ligand of that target, such as another antibody. The concentration at which 50 percent binding inhibition occurs is known as the K<sub>i</sub>. Under ideal conditions, the K<sub>i </sub>is equivalent to K<sub>D</sub>. The K<sub>i </sub>value will never be less than the K<sub>D</sub>, so measurement of K<sub>i </sub>can conveniently be substituted to provide an upper limit for K<sub>D</sub>.</p>An antibody of the invention may have a K<sub>D </sub>for its target of 1\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M or less, 1\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M or less, or 1\u00d710<sup>\u22129</sup>M or less, or 1\u00d710<sup>\u221210</sup>M or less, 1\u00d710<sup>\u221211</sup>M or less, or 1\u00d710<sup>\u221212 </sup>M or less.</p>An antibody that specifically binds its target may bind its target with a high affinity, that is, exhibiting a low K<sub>D </sub>as discussed above, and may bind to other, non-target molecules with a lower affinity. For example, the antibody may bind to non-target molecules with a K<sub>D </sub>of 1\u00d710<sup>\u22126</sup>M or more, more preferably 1\u00d710<sup>\u22125 </sup>M or more, more preferably 1\u00d710<sup>\u22124 </sup>M or more, more preferably 1\u00d710<sup>\u22123 </sup>M or more, even more preferably 1\u00d710<sup>\u22122 </sup>M or more.

Examples of binding properties include but are not limited to, binding specificity, equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>), dissociation and association rates (k<sub>off </sub>and k<sub>on</sub>, respectively), binding affinity and/or avidity. It is generally understood that a binding molecule (e.g., a Fc variant protein such as an antibody) with a low K<sub>D </sub>may be preferable to a binding molecule with a high K<sub>D</sub>. However, in some instances the value of the k<sub>on </sub>or k<sub>off </sub>may be more relevant than the value of the K<sub>D</sub>. One skilled in the art can determine which kinetic parameter is most important for a given antibody application.</p>The affinities and binding properties of an Fc polypeptide for its ligand may be determined by a variety of in vitro assay methods (biochemical or immunological based assays) known in the art for determining Fc-Fc\u03b3R interactions, i.e., specific binding of an Fc polypeptide to an Fc\u03b3R including but not limited to, equilibrium methods (e.g., enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA), or radioimmunoassay (RIA)), or kinetics (e.g., BIACORE\u00ae analysis, OCTET\u00ae, Fort\u00e9Bio, Menlo Park, Calif.), and other methods such as indirect binding assays, competitive inhibition assays, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), gel electrophoresis and chromatography (e.g., gel filtration). These and other methods may utilize a label on one or more of the components being examined and/or employ a variety of detection methods including but not limited to chromogenic, fluorescent, luminescent, or isoto",
    "etyl-L-cysteine was used as a standard to quantify the amount of free sulfhydryl present for each antibody. Bovine serum albumin (BSA; OmniPur BSA Fraction V, Catalog No. 2910, EMD Chemicals) was additionally included as a positive control since it contains one single unpaired cysteine. As shown in Table 5, the results disclosed herein indicate that free sulfhydryl was detected for the anti-5T4 single-cysteine variants and not for the parental anti-5T4 antibody. In the absence of DTT, increased levels of free \u2014SH was not observed for the six cysteine variants assessed compared with the wild type anti-5T4 protein. Unpredictably, the 5T4-S254C variant exhibited aggregation and was unstable following reduction with DTT.</p>TABLE 5\u03bcM -SH/\u03bcM proteinAntibodyNo DTTDTT (2 mM)Parental 5T40.240.305T4-S254C0.190.03 &lt; LOQ5T4-E380C0.160.825T4-L398C0.260.905T4-V422C0.201.02\nEvaluation of Anti-5T4 Engineered Single Cysteine Variants Binding to Human FcRn\n</p>It is believed in the art that FcRn interacts with IgG regardless of subtype in a pH dependent manner and protects the antibody from degradation by preventing it from entering the lysosomal compartment where it is degraded. Therefore, a consideration for selecting positions for introduction of reactive cysteines into the wild type IgG1-Fc region was to avoid altering the FcRn binding properties and half-life of the antibody comprising the engineered cysteine.</p>BIAcore\u00ae analysis was performed to determine the steady-state affinity (KD) for anti-5T4 engineered single cysteine variants for binding human FcRn. BIAcore\u00ae technology utilizes changes in the refractive index at the surface layer of a sensor upon binding of the anti-5T4 single engineered cysteine variants to human FcRn protein immobilized on the layer. Binding is detected by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of laser light refracting from the surface. Human FcRn was specifically biotinylated through an engineered Avi-tag using the BirA reagent (Catalog #: BIRA500, Avidity, LLC, Aurora, Colo.) and immobilized onto a streptavidin (SA) sensor chip to enable uniform orientation of the FcRn protein on the sensor. Next, various concentrations of the anti-5T4 single-cysteine variants in 20 mM MES (2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid pH 6.0, with 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), 0.5% Surfactant P20 (MES-EP) were injected over the chip surface. The surface was regenerated using HBS-EP+0.05% Surfactant P20 (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J., Piscataway, N.J.), pH 7.4, between injection cycles. The steady-state binding affinities were determined for the anti-5T4 engineered single-cysteine variants and these were compared with the parental wild type anti-5T4 (comprising no cysteine mutations in the IgG1 Fc region). The results are set forth at Table 6, and these data demonstrate that incorporation of engineered cysteine residues into the IgG-Fc region at the novel positions of the invention did not alter affinity to FcRn.</p>TABLE 6AntibodySteady-state KD [nM]Parental anti-5T4 Ab412.15T4-E380C390.15T4-K392C383.55T4-L398C513.45T4-V422C443.35T4-S440C608.4\nEvaluation of Single-Cysteine Anti-5T4 Variant ADCs Binding to Human FcRn\n</p>BIAcore\u00ae analysis was performed to determine the steady-state affinity (KD) for anti-5T4 ADCs binding to human FcRn where the ADCs were site-specifically conjugated through the engineered cysteines thereby linking a toxin to the antibody. Briefly, ADCs were prepared by conjugating mcMMAD, as more fully disclosed below, to the engineered cysteine for the variants 5T4-E380C, 5T4-L398C, 5T4-V422C and 5T4-L443C. Using the same Biacore SPR method described previously, various concentrations of the site-specifically conjugated 5T4-mcMMAD ADCs, the single-cysteine variants not conjugated to mcMMAD (described previously and results shown in Table 6), and the parental \u201cnaked\u201d (i.e., not conjugated to mcMMAD) wild type anti-5T4 antibody in MES-EP+0.5% Surfactant P20 pH 6.0 were injected, separately, over the human FcRn surface and steady-state affinities were determined and the results are shown in Table 7.</p>TABLE 7ADC or Naked AntibodySteady-state KD [nM]Parental anti-5T4 antibody493.35T4-E380C-mcMMAD408.75T4-L398C-mcMMAD703.95T4-V422C-mcMMAD401.85T4-L443C-mcMMAD (1)697.05T4-L443C-mcMMAD (2)518.5</p>The results shown in Table 7 demonstrate that the 5T4-mcMMAD ADCs site-specifically conjugated using the novel cysteine positions of the invention have similar affinities to human FcRn compared with each other and that these affinities for FcRn are comparable to those of the naked un-conjugated single cysteine variants (compare with Table 6 above), as well as for the un-conjugated parental 5T4 antibody. Thus, these data demonstrate that conjugation of a toxin moiety to the engineered reactive cysteines introduced into the IgG1 Fc region did not affect Fc binding to FcRn.</p>Example 2Generation of Double-Cysteine Engineered Anti-5T4 AntibodiesNine combinations of two reactive cysteine residues were introduced into the anti-5T4 antibody comprising human IgG1. The amino acid sequence of the wild type full-length heavy chain of this antibody is set forth in FIG. 17A (SEQ ID NO:83) and the amino acid sequence of the full-length kappa light chain of this antibody is set forth in FIG. 17B (SEQ ID NO:84). The mutations to substitute the relevant wild type amino acid to the novel engineered cysteine in the heavy chain constant region were introduced using the same over-lapping PCR mutagenesis method as described previously in Example 1. Introduction of two reactive cysteines into each IgG1 Fc region thus provided four novel cysteine",
    "ts disclosed in Tables 14-16 are located in the CH2 and CH3 domains within the Fc domain of the IgG1 heavy chain. Any nonspecific loading of the electrophillic payload onto the antibody is presumed to occur at the \u201cinterchain\u201d also referred to as the \u201cinternal\u201d cysteine residues (i.e., those that are typically part of the HC\u2014HC or HC-LC disulfide bridges). In order to distinguish loading of electrophile onto the engineered cysteines in the Fc domain versus loading onto the internal cysteine residues (otherwise typically forming the S\u2014S bonds between HC\u2014HC or HC-LC), the conjugates were treated with a protease known to cleave between the Fab domains and the Fc domain of the antibody. One such protease is the cysteine protease IdeS, marketed as \u201cFabRICATOR\u00ae\u201d by Genovis, and described in von Pawel-Rammingen et al., 2002, EMBO J. 21:1607. FIG. 4 depicts a diagram illustrating the cleavage by this protease of an intact antibody molecule showing the positions (dark squares) of the internal cystine bonds.</p>Briefly, following the manufacturer's suggested conditions, the ADC was treated with FabRICATOR\u00ae protease and the sample was incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes. Samples were prepped for LCMS analysis by combining approximately 20 \u03bcL of sample (approximately 1 mg/mL in PBS) with 20 \u03bcL of 20 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and allowing the mixture to stand at room temperature for 5 minutes. This treatment of human IgG1 resulted in three antibody fragments, all ranging from about 23 to 26 kD in size as illustrated in the diagram depicted in FIG. 4 which illustrates the fragments resulting from FabRICATOR treatment: the LC fragment comprising an internal cysteine which typically forms an LC-HC interchain disulfide bond; the N-terminal HC fragment comprising three internal cysteines (where one typically forms an LC-HC disulfide bond and the other two cysteines found in the hinge region of the antibody and which typically form HC\u2014HC disulfide bonds between the two heavy chains of the antibody); and the C-terminal HC fragment which contains no reactive cysteines other than those introduced by mutation in the novel constructs disclosed herein. The samples were analyzed by MS as described above. Loading calculations were performed in the same manner as previously described (above) in order to quantitate the loading of the LC, the N-terminal HC, and the C-terminal HC. Loading on the C-terminal HC is considered \u201cspecific\u201d loading while loading onto the LC and the N-terminal HC is considered \u201cnonspecific\u201d loading. FIG. 5A shows the MS tracing results for 5T4-L443C variant that is not loaded after FabRICATOR\u00ae protease treatment. The insert depicts a diagram illustrating the proteolytic cleavage fragments generated by FabRICATOR\u00ae treatment. FIG. 5B is a graph showing the MS tracings results for FabRICATOR\u00ae treatment of ADC 5T4-L443C-mcMMAD.

    "the engineered antibody with TCEP (tris2-carboxyethyl)phosphine) followed by re-oxidation of the internal disulfides with DHA (dehydroascorbic acid) was used which allowed for a conjugation with maleimides that resulted in a more homogeneous ADC (as measured by MS and by HIC). FIGS. 8 and 9 show the tracings produced by conjugations using Method \u201cA\u201d (FIGS. 8A, 8C, 8E, 8G, 9A, 9C, 9E and 9G) and conjugations using \u201cMethod B\u201d (FIGS. 8B, 8D, 8F, 8H, 9B, 9D, 9F, and 9H). Descriptions of the 8 conjugates are as follows: 8A and 8B, 5T4-E380C-mcMMAD; 8C and 8D, 5T4-L398C-mcMMAD; 8E and 8F, 5T4-L443C-mcMMAD; 8G and 8H, 5T4-K388C-mcMMAD; 9A and 9B, 5T4-E380C+L398C-mcMMAD; 9C and 9D, 5T4-E398C+L443C-mcMMAD; 9E and 9F, 5T4-E380C+L443C-mcMMAD; and 9G and 9H, 5T4-E380C+V422C-mcMMAD.</p>A summary of the results of various conjugations using \u201cMethod A\u201d and \u201cMethod B\u201d is presented in Table 19. The data disclosed in Table 19 and in FIGS. 8 and 9 demonstrate that conjugates generated using \u201cMethod B\u201d showed improved specific loading and improved homogeneity as compared to the same conjugates prepared by \u201cMethod A\u201d.</p>Conjugation \u201cMethod B\u201d</p>Conjugation \u201cMethod B\u201d was performed as follows. A 20 mM TCEP solution (50 to 100 molar equivalents) was added to the antibody (5 mg) such that the final antibody concentration was 5 mg/mL in PBS containing 50 mM EDTA. After allowing the reaction to stand at 37\u00b0 C. for 1.5 hour, the antibody was buffer exchanged into PBS containing 50 mM EDTA using a 50 kD MW cutoff spin concentration device (3\u00d73 mL wash, 10\u00d7 concentration per cycle). The resulting antibody was re-suspended in 1 mL of PBS containing 50 mM EDTA and treated with a freshly prepared 50 mM solution of DHA in 1:1 PBS/EtOH (final DHA concentration=1 mM\u22124 mM) and allowed to stand at 4\u00b0 C. overnight.</p>The antibody/DHA mixture was buffer exchanged into PBS containing 50 mM EDTA using a 50 kD MW cutoff spin concentration device (3\u00d73 mL wash, 10\u00d7 concentration per cycle). The resulting antibody was re-suspended in 1 mL of PBS containing 50 mM EDTA and treated with 33 uL of 10 mM maleimide payload (mcMMAD) in DMA. After standing for 1.5 hours, the material was buffer exchanged (as above) into 1 mL of PBS (3\u00d73 mL washes, 10\u00d7 concentration per cycle). Purification by SEC was performed (as needed) to remove any aggregated material. The structures of the mcMMAD, vcMMAD, and mcMMAF linker-payload used to produce the results in Tables 15-19 are shown in FIG. 10 which also includes Mal-PEG6C2-MMAD and Mal-PEG3C2-MMAD.</p>The loading results of a variety of conjugations of double-cysteine mutants, comprising engineered cysteines in the Fc and/or Kappa (Table 24; Example 10) constant domains, using both Method A and Method B, are provided in Table 19 below.</p>TABLE 19Linker-Loading (usingLoading (usingAntibodypayloadMethod B)*Method A)*5T4-E380CmcMMAD2.0(0)1.8(0.2)5T4-L398CmcMMAD1.8(0)1.8(0.2)5T4-L443CmcMMAD2.0(0)2.1(0.2)5T4-V422CmcMMAD1.6(0)1.4(0.1)5T4-K392CmcMMAD2.0(0)1.7(0.24)5T4-E380C-L398CmcMMAD4.0(0.2)3.2(0)5T4-L398C-L443CmcMMAD3.8(0)3.2(0)5T4-E380C-L443CmcMMAD4.0(0.2)3.6(0)5T4-E380C-V422CmcMMAD4.0(0.2)3.3(0)Her2-E380C-L443CmcMMAD4.3(0.6)NAHer2-L443CmcMMAD2.0(0.08)NAHer2-E380CmcMMAD1.9(0.12)NA5T4-L398C-L443CmcMMAD3.8(0)NA5T4-L398C-V422CmcMMAD3.7(0)NA5T4-K392C-L443CmcMMAD3.5(0)NAHer2-Q347CMalPeg6C2-2NAMMADHer2-Q347CmcMMAD2NAHer2-Y373CMalPeg6C2-1.6NAMMADHer2-Y373CmcM"
