    "espectively, where these molecules bind to their specific antigen. Since most sequence variation associated with immunoglobulins and T cell receptors is found in the CDRs, these regions are sometimes referred to as hypervariable regions. Mutations may be introduced by site-directed mutagenesis or PCR-mediated mutagenesis and the effect on antibody binding, or other functional property of interest, can be evaluated in appropriate in vitro or in vivo assays. Preferably conservative modifications are introduced and typically no more than one, two, three, four or five residues within a CDR region are altered. The mutations may be amino acid substitutions, additions or deletions. [0150] Framework modifications can be made to the antibodies to decrease immunogenicity, for example, by \u201cbackmutating\u201d one or more framework residues to the corresponding germline sequence. [0151] It is also contemplated that the antigen binding domain may be multi-specific or multivalent by multimerizing the antigen binding domain with VH and VL region pairs that bind either the same antigen (multi-valent) or a different antigen (multi-specific). [0152] The binding affinity of the antigen binding region, such as the variable regions (heavy chain and/or light chain variable region), or of the CDRs may be at least 10<sup>-5</sup>M, 10<sup>-6</sup>M, 10<sup>-7</sup>M, 10<sup>-8</sup>M, 10<sup>-9</sup>M, 10<sup>-10</sup>M, 10<sup>-11</sup>M, 10<sup>-12</sup>M, or 10<sup>-13</sup>M. In some embodiments, the KD of the antigen binding region, such as the variable regions (heavy chain and/or light chain variable region), or of the CDRs may be at least 10<sup>-5</sup>M, 10<sup>-6</sup>M, 10<sup>-7</sup>M, 10<sup>-8</sup>M, 10<sup>-9</sup>M, 10<sup>-10</sup>M, 10<sup>-11</sup>M, 10<sup>-12</sup>M, or 10<sup>-13</sup>M (or any derivable range therein). [0153] Binding affinity, KA, or KD can be determined by methods known in the art such as by surface plasmon resonance (SRP)-based biosensors, by kinetic exclusion assay (KinExA), by optical scanner for microarray detection based on polarization-modulated oblique-incidence reflectivity difference (OI-RD), or by ELISA.

In some embodiments, the framework regions, such as FR1, FR2, FR3, and/or FR4 of a human framework can each or collectively have at least, at most, or exactly 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, \n\n36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126,</p>127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145,</p>14",
