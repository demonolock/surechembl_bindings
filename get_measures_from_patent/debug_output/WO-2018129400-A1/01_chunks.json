In some embodiments, a composition of a fully non- fucosylated antibody has a degree of fucosylation of less than about 10%. In a composition of a \"partially fucosylated antibody\" only part of the oligosaccharides comprise fucose. An individual antibody in such a composition can comprise fucose residues in none, one or both of the N- linked oligosaccharides in the Fc region, provided that the composition does not comprise essentially all individual antibodies that lack fucose residues in the N-linked oligosaccharides in the Fc region, nor essentially all individual antibodies that contain fucose residues in both of the N- linked oligosaccharides in the Fc region.

In some embodiments, the binding affinity of an antibody for a Siglec-8 (which may be a dimer, such as the Siglec-8-Fc fusion protein described herein) can generally be represented by a dissociation constant (Kd). Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art, including those described herein. </p> [0063] \"Binding avidity\" as used herein refers to the binding strength of multiple binding sites of a molecule (e.g. , an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g. , an antigen). </p>[0064] An \"isolated\" nucleic acid molecule encoding the antibodies herein is a nucleic acid molecule that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid molecule with which it is ordinarily associated in the environment in which it was produced. In some embodiments, the isolated nucleic acid is free of association with all components associated with the production environment.

The \u03b3 and a classes are further divided into \n\n subclasses e.g. , humans express the following subclasses: IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgAl and IgA2. IgGl antibodies can exist in multiple polymorphic variants termed allotypes (reviewed in Jefferis and Lefranc 2009. mAbs Vol 1 Issue 4 1-7) any of which are suitable for use in some of the embodiments herein.

In some embodiments, the antibody may comprise a heavy chain comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 87; and/or a light chain comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:76. In some embodiments, the anti-Siglec-8 antibody induces apoptosis of activated eosinophils. In some embodiments, the anti-Siglec-8 antibody induces apoptosis of resting eosinophils. In some embodiments, the anti-Siglec-8 antibody depletes activated eosinophils and inhibits mast cell activation. In some embodiments, the anti-Siglec-8 antibody depletes or reduces mast cells and inhibits mast cell activation. In some embodiments, the anti-Siglec-8 antibody depleted or reduces the number of mast cells. In some embodiments, the anti-Siglec-8 antibody kills mast cells by ADCC activity. In some embodiments, the antibody depletes or reduces mast cells expressing Siglec-8 in a tissue. In some embodiments, the antibody depletes or reduces mast cells expressing Siglec-8 in a biological fluid. </p> 1. Antibody Affinity </p> [0137] In some aspects, an anti-Siglec-8 antibody described herein binds to human Siglec-8 with about the same or higher affinity and/or higher avidity as compared to mouse antibody 2E2 and/or mouse antibody 2C4. In certain embodiments, an anti-Siglec-8 antibody provided herein has a dissociation constant (Kd) of &lt; \u0399\u03bc\u039c, &lt; 150 nM, &lt; 100 nM, &lt; 50 nM, &lt; 10 nM, &lt; 1 nM, \u2264 0.1 nM,\u2264 0.01 nM, or\u2264 0.001 nM (e.g. 10-8 M or less, e.g. from 10-8 M to 10-13 M, e.g., \n\n from 10-9 M to 10-13 M). In some embodiments, an anti-Siglec-8 antibody described herein binds to human Siglec-8 at about 1.5-fold, about 2- fold, about 3-fold, about 4-fold, about 5-fold, about 6-fold, about 7-fold, about 8-fold, about 9-fold or about 10-fold higher affinity than mouse antibody 2E2 and/or mouse antibody 2C4. In some embodiments, the anti-Siglec-8 antibody comprises a heavy chain variable region comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6; and/or a light chain variable region comprising the amino acid sequence selected from SEQ ID NOs: 16 or 21. </p> [0138] In one embodiment, the binding affinity of the anti-Siglec-8 antibody can be determined by a surface plasmon resonance assay. For example, the Kd or Kd value can be measured by using a BIAcore\u2122-2000 or a BIAcore\u2122-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) at 25\u00b0 C with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at -10 response units (RU). Briefly, </p>carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIAcore\u00ae Inc.) are activated with N-ethyl- N'-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Capture antibodies (e.g., anti-human-Fc) are diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, before injection at a flow rate of 30 \u03bc\u0390/minute and further immobilized with an anti-Siglec-8 antibody. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of dimeric Siglec-8 are injected in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) at 25\u00b0 C at a flow rate of approximately 25 \u03bc\u0390/min. Association rates (k<sub>on</sub>) and dissociation rates (k<sub>Dff</sub>) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAcore\u00ae Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneously fitting the association and dissociation sensorgrams. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) is calculated as the ratio koff/kon. See, e.g., Chen, Y., et al., (1999) J. Mol. Biol. 293:865-881. </p> [0139] In another embodiment, biolayer interferometry may be used to determine the affinity of anti-Siglec-8 antibodies against Siglec-8. In an exemplary assay, Siglec-8-Fc tagged protein is immobilized onto anti-human capture sensors, and incubated with increasing concentrations of mouse, chimeric, or humanized anti-Siglec-8 Fab fragments to obtain affinity measurements using an instrument such as, for example, the Octet Red 384 System (ForteBio). </p>[0140] The binding affinity of the anti-Siglec-8 antibody can, for example, also be determined by the Scatchard analysis described in Munson et al., Anal. Biochem., 107:220 (1980) using standard techniques well known in the relevant art. See also Scatchard, G., Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 51:660 (1947). \n\n 2. Antibody Avidity </p> [0141] In some embodiments, the binding avidity of the anti-Siglec-8 antibody can be determined by a surface plasmon resonance assay. For example, the Kd or Kd value can be measured by using a BIAcore T100. Capture antibodies (e.g., goat-anti-human-Fc and goat-anti- mouse-Fc) are immobilized on a CM5 chip. Flow-cells can be immobilized with anti-human or with anti-mouse antibodies. The assay is conducted at a certain temperature and flow rate, for example, at 25oC at a flow rate of 30\u03bc1/\u03b7\u03b9\u03af\u03b7. Dimeric Siglec-8 is diluted in assay buffer at various concentrations, for example, at a concentration ranging from 15nM to </p>1.88pM. Antibodies are captured and high performance injections are conducted, followed by dissociations. Flow cells are regenerated with a buffer, for example, 50mM glycine pH 1.5. Results are blanked with an empty reference cell and multiple assay buffer injections, and analyzed with 1 : 1 global fit parameters. </p> 3. Competition Assays </p> [0142] Competition-assays can be used to determine whether two antibodies bind the same epitope by recognizing identical or sterically overlapping epitopes or one antibody competitively inhibits binding of another antibody to the antigen. These assays are known in the art. Typically, antigen or antigen expressing cells is immobilized on a multi-well plate and the ability of unlabeled antibodies to block the binding of labeled antibodies is measured. Common labels for such competition assays are radioactive labels or enzyme labels. In some embodiments, an anti- Siglec-8 antibody described herein competes with a 2E2 antibody described herein, for binding to the epitope present",

Some E. coli protease-deficient strains are available and described in, for example, Joly et al. (1998), supra; Georgiou et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,264,365; Georgiou et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,508,192; Hara et al., Microbial Drug Resistance, 2:63-72 (1996). </p> [0202] In one embodiment, E. coli strains deficient for proteolytic enzymes and transformed with plasmids overexpressing one or more chaperone proteins are used as host cells in the expression system of the present disclosure. </p> c) Antibody Purification </p>[0203] In one embodiment, the antibody protein produced herein is further purified to obtain preparations that are substantially homogeneous for further assays and uses. Standard protein purification methods known in the art can be employed. The following procedures are exemplary of suitable purification procedures: fractionation on immunoaffinity or ion-exchange columns, ethanol precipitation, reverse phase HPLC, chromatography on silica or on a cation- \n\n exchange resin such as DEAE, chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and gel filtration using, for example, Sephadex G-75. </p> [0204] In one aspect, Protein A immobilized on a solid phase is used for immunoaffinity purification of the antibody products of the present disclosure. Protein A is a 41 kD cell wall protein from Staphylococcus aureas which binds with a high affinity to the Fc region of antibodies. Lindmark et al (1983) J. Immunol. Meth. 62:1-13. The solid phase to which Protein A is immobilized can be a column comprising a glass or silica surface, or a controlled pore glass column or a silicic acid column. In some applications, the column is coated with a reagent, such as glycerol, to possibly prevent nonspecific adherence of contaminants. </p> [0205] As the first step of purification, a preparation derived from the cell culture as described above can be applied onto a Protein A immobilized solid phase to allow specific binding of the antibody of interest to Protein A. The solid phase would then be washed to remove contaminants non-specifically bound to the solid phase. Finally the antibody of interest is recovered from the solid phase by elution. </p> Generating Antibodies Using Eukar otic Host Cells: </p>[0206] A vector for use in a eukaryotic host cell generally includes one or more of the following non-limiting components: a signal sequence, an origin of replication, one or more marker genes, an enhancer element, a promoter, and a transcription termination sequence. </p> a) Signal Sequence Component </p> [0207] A vector for use in a eukaryotic host cell may also contain a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N-terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide of interest. The heterologous signal sequence selected may be"
