L., from Meister (Ed.), Advances in Enzymol., 61, 381436, 1988;). Assays were carried out by addition of various concentrations of inhibitor to assay buffer containing substrate. Assays were initiated by the addition of enzyme to the reaction mixture and the change in fluorescence monitored over time. During the course of the assay less than 10% of the substrate was consumed.  \nF=vs\ue89et+(vo-vs)\ue89e\u230a1-\uf74d(kobs\u00b7i)\u230bkobs+D(5)<img id=\"EMI-M00004\" path=\"US20040106805A1-20040603-M00004.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/21686077/US/20040603/A1/020040/10/68/05/US20040106805A1-20040603-M00004.TIF\"/>\n</p>[0481] The activity fluorescence progress curves were fitted by non-linear regression analysis (Prism) using Eq. 5 (Morrison, 1969; Morrison, 1982); where \u2018F\u2019 is the fluorescence response, \u2018t\u2019 is time, \u2018v<sub>o</sub>\u2019 is the initial velocity, \u2018v<sub>s</sub>\u2019 is the equilibrium steady-state velocity, \u2018k<sub>obs</sub>\u2019 is the observed pseudo first-order rate constant and \u2018D\u2019 is the intercept at time zero (i.e. the ordinate displacement of the curve).
