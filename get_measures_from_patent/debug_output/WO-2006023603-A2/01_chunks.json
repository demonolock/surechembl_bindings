Figure IA shows heart sections (upper) and M- mode echocardiogram (lower), scale is one mm. Abbreviations and their meanings follow: Con: sham Operated mice - 3 weeks after operation, TAC: transverse aortic constriction (which induces pressure overload), +/-SiI: with or without sildenafil treatment. In non- sildenafil treated animals, sustained pressure-load results in marked heart hypertrophy and dilation. By 9-weeks, hearts were profoundly remodeled and display a significant reduction in cardiac function. Note the echocardiograms show dilation and reduced wall shortening. Sildenafil treated animals show a marked reduction in the development of both hypertrophy and chamber dilation, and have preserved cardiac function. Figure IB provides three summary graphs for the ratio of heart weight to tibia length; percent fractional shortening (derived from echocardiography); and left ventricular end-systolic diameter (a measure of cardiac dilation/remodeling and systolic function) in control, and TAC mice three and nine weeks after the operation. Abbreviations and their meanings for Figure IB follow: HW/TL heart weight/ tibia length, fractional shortening (FS) and LV end-systolic diameter (LV-ESD) \n\nby echocardiography (mean \u00b1 sem.; n &gt; 6); * p&lt;0.001 vs vehicle. Cardiac hypertrophy increased profoundly in non-sildenafil treated animals, and was reduced by more than 50% by sildenafil treatment. Heart function also improved with treatment. Figure 1C displays six micrographs and a summary graph. The micrographs show PAS-methenamine-stained myocardium from vehicle versus SiI treated animals.. The dark blue color reflects interstitial fibrosis. Scale bar represents 100 \u03bcm. Lower bar graph shows summary data for myocyte cross sectional diameter (CSD); * p&lt;0.01 vs vehicle treatment. Sildenafil treatment during sustained pressure overload blocked the enlargement of cardiac muscle cell hypertrophy, and also inhibited the development of interstitial fibrosis.</p>Figure 2 is a dose response curve showing free plasma sildenafil concentrations in mice achieved at varying daily oral doses. At 100 mg/kg/day, the dose used for the studies outlined in Figure 1 and throughout this application, free plasma sildenafil concentration was 10.4 \u00b1 5.7 nM, very near the IC<sub>50</sub> for the compound.</p>Figures 3A-3C show that inhibition of PDE5A with sildenafil reverses established cardiac hypertrophy. Figure 3 A includes three graphs showing that one week of TAC induces cardiac hypertrophy without chamber dilatation. Abbreviations are as in Figure 1. Wall thickness and LV-end-diastolic volume (LV-EDD) were determined by echocardiography. Figure 3B (left panel) includes two micrographs showing PAS- methenamine-stained myocardium that displays myocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis at one week TAC (before treatment). This hypertrophy and fibrosis was reduced by subsequent two weeks of treatment with sildenafil (TAC-3 week, 2 week SiI). Scale is 100 \u03bcm. Figure 3B (right panel) is a graph providing summary data; *p&lt;0.05 vs Con; ^p&lt;0.05 vs TAC lweek. Figure 3C is a graph showing the reversal of hypertrophy by sildenafil. Data start after 1-week of TAC (both groups had the same initial level of hypertrophy at this time). Animals were then randomized to receive either placebo or sildenafil treatment. The sildenafil treated group shows reduction in cardiac hypertrophy and sustained cardiac function (fractional shortening) over the ensuing 2-week period. In contrast, placebo treated hearts undergo progressive hypertrophy and cardiac dysfunction. P-values are for analysis of covariance for treatment effect.</p>Figures 4A and 4B show that sildenafil treated hearts have less cardiac remodeling and improved contractile and diastolic function relative to controls. Figure 4A shows in vivo heart fun",
    "3wk vehicle-treated TAC, TAC+EMD; 3wk EMD360527-treated TAC. * p&lt;0.05 vs Con; <sup>t</sup>p&lt;0.05 vs vehicle-treated TAC. As with sildenafil, EMD360527 treatment prevented the development of both cardiac hypertrophy and accompanying chamber dilation and remodeling. Figure 5B displays representative M- mode echocardiography (left panel) and three graphs showing a summary of cardiac mechanics based on invasive pressure-volume catheterization (right panels). Abbreviations for Figure 5B are described as previously or as follows: Ea - ventricular afterload was identically increased by TAC with or without concomitant EMD360527. Maximal cardiac power index (PMXI) rose and isovolumic relaxation (Tau) was shortened significantly in EMD-TAC as compared to TAC. These data were nearly identical to those obtained using sildenafil (i.e. Figure 4). *p&lt;0.05 vs Con and EMD; ^p\u03b8.05 vs all other groups. Figure 5C shows a dot blot and a graph that summarizes the analysis of cardiac fetal gene expression. Abbreviations for Figure 5C are as follows: ANP: A-type natriuretic peptide; B-type natriuretic peptide, \u03b2MHC : \u03b2-myosin heavy chain , and \u03b1SkA: \u03b1 skeletal actin, and calcium handling proteins PLB: phospholamban, SERCA: sarcoplasmic reticular calcium ATPase (upper panel). Summary data are shown normalized to GAPDH expression (lower panel). TAC resulted in fetal gene recapitulation \u2014 with increases in natriuretic peptide, \u03b2MHC, and \u03b1SkA expression, and reductions in PLB and SERCA. PDE5 A inhibition reversed fetal gene recapitulation and improved expression Of Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling proteins altered by TAC. *p&lt;0.05 vs Con, ^p&lt;0.05 vs TAC. Figure 5D is a graph showing whole myocardial cGMP levels increased with TAC itself, but there was a slight decline in TAC treated with EMD360527. As displayed in the next figure, this response was similar to that observed with sildenafil, and corresponds to a marked fall in natriuretic peptide expression despite inhibition of PDE5. *p&lt;0.05 vs Con and EMD, <sup>f</sup>p&lt;0.05 vs TAC.</p>Figures 6A-6D show that PDE5A activity was increased in hearts stimulated to undergo hypertrophy and remodeling by pressure-overload. The stimulation of protein kinase G-I by PDE5a was inhibited by sildenafil in this condition. Figure 6 A is a graph showing whole heart PKG-I activity. *\u03c1&lt;0.05 vs Con; ^0.05 vs vehicle-treated TAC. PKG-I is activated by cGMP, which in turn is increased if PDE5 is inhibited by sildenafil. Under rest conditions, there was little net effect from PDE5 inhibition on PKG-I activation. In contrast, in hearts with hypertrophy/remodeling following 3-weeks TAC, sildenafil markedly increased PKG-I activity. Figure 6B is a graph showing total cGMP-esterase activity in sham control hearts (Con) and three week TAC hearts (TAC). At baseline, the percent of \n\ntotal activity that was blocked by co-incubation with a selective PDE5 A inhibitor (sildenafil or tadalafil) was approximately 30%. Broad PDE inhibition by IBMX is shown as a control. With sustained pressure-overload (TAC), total cGMP-esterase activity increased (* p&lt;0.005). The proportion of this activity attributable to PDE5 also rose to nearly 60% of the total (100% increase in enzyme activity) (pO.OOl by 2-way ANOVA). Figure 6C is a graph showing whole heart cGMP levels. *p&lt;0.05 vs Con. Figure 6D (upper panel) displays two Western blots for the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (Cn) and mitogen activated kinase - extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2). Figure 6D (lower panel) provides two graphs summarizing the Western blot results (n=4-5 for each). ERK1/2 summary results are shown as the ratio of phospho (p) to total (t) protein. *p&lt;0.05 vs Con; 'p&lt;0.05 vs vehicle- treated TAC (TAC). One week TAC increased expression and activity of both enzymes. This effect was blunted by sildenafil. At the later TAC time point (9 weeks), only calcineurin remained markedly increased. Calcineurin was still diminished in heart co-treated by sildenafil.</p>Figures 7A- 7D show that PDE5 A-inhibition with sildenafil prevents neonatal rat cardiomyocyte hypertrophy via calcineurin/NFAT dependent pathway. Figure 7A (left panel) is a series of three micrographs. These micrographs show the effect of phenylephrine (PE) on myocyte hypertrophy as shown by increased sarcomere organization (Figure 7 A \u03b1- actinin staining, (x 1000)). Figure 7B (right panel) is a graph that quantitates protein synthesis as <sup>3</sup>H-leucine incorporation percent in myocytes with organized sarcomeres (*p&lt;0.05 vs Con; <sup>\"</sup>*p&lt;0.05 vs PE). Sildenafil treatment reduced sarcomere organization and protein synthesis in PE-stimulated myocytes. Figure 7C is a series often micrographs showing myocytes transfected with NFAT-promoter coupled to \u03b2-galactosidase (x 200). Blue staining indicates NFAT activation. Abbreviations for Figure 7C are as follows: PE \u2014 phenylephrine; BK - BayK 8644; AdCn - calcineurin overexpression by adenovirus. Panels (1,3,5) are with phase contrast filter (+fil), others are without (- fil). Figure 7D is a series of three graphs showing the quantitative analysis of NFAT (i.e. \u03b2-galactosidase) activity (*p&lt;0.05 vs Con; <sup>\u03c4</sup>\u03c1&lt;0.05 vs hypertrophy stimulation (PE, BK or AdCn)). Sildenafil treatment inhibited NFAT activation by PE and by BayK 8644. However, NFAT activated in cells with calcineurin constitutively active could not been blocked by sildenafil. This supports a more proximal target for the drug effect.</p>Figures 8A-8F are micrographs showing adenoviral transfection efficiency. Panels 8 A and 8C display micrographs of neonatal myocytes from separate dishes transfected with adenovirus expressing nuclear targeted <sup>\u03b2</sup>-galactosidase, and stained using X-gal. \n\nCorresponding panels 8B and 8D are the same cells observed without phase contrast. Panels 8E and 8F show a lower power view of one dish (8E: with, and 8F: without phase contrast) to demonstrate uniformity of transfection. Transfection efficiency was consistent and near 95%.</p>Figure 9A- 9C are graphs showing the assessment of NFAT promoter activation in neonatal myocytes transfected with an adenovirus coding for the NFAT promoter coupled to luciferase. Cells were then exposed to phenylephrine (PE), calcium enhancement (BK), or an adenovirus encoding active calcineurin (AdCn), and co-incubated with vehicle or sildenafil. After a forty-eight hour incubation, cells were assessed for luciferase activity by luminometer. Data are shown as percent change normalized to control level. Sildenafil (SiI) inhibited PE and BK induced NFAT promoter activity, but not AdCn-induced activity. These results were similar with the findings using an NFAT-promoter coupled to beta-galactosidase virus. *p&lt;0.05 vs Con, f p&lt;0.05 vs hypertrophy stimulation (PE<sub>3</sub>BK, or AdCn).</p>Figures 10A- 1OE show the inactivation of the Akt pathway by PDE5A inhibition. Figure 1OA is a Western blot and summary data of phospho (p) and total (t) Akt at 1 and 9 week TAC. Figure 1OB is a graph showing the results of an Akt activity assay. Figure 1OC is a graph showing the results of a PBK activity assay (data at 3 week TAC, S: sildenafil treatment only). PBK activity and Akt activity were both significantly increased at 1 and 9 weeks of TAC, and were inhibited towards control levels by treatment with sildenafil. Figure 1OD is a Western blot and a graph showing a summary of data for GSK3\u03b2 expression and activation. GSK3\u03b2 is a downstream kinase that regulated hypertrophy, and is activated by Akt and other kinases. TAC induced GSK3\u03b2 activity was reduced by sildenafil at 9-week but not at 1-week. Figure 1OE shows the effect of chronic effect of sildenafil on transgenic mice overexpressing constitutive active Akt in the heart. Post-mortem hearts are displayed at the top, and summary data based on echo and post-mortem analysis below. Scale marks are 1 mm. LV mass from serial echocardiography and post-mortem study is shown below, with higher LV mass in AktTG (p&lt;0.05) for all comparisons. Akt overexpression itself resulted in greater ventricular hypertrophy, and sildenafil did not alter this mass increase. This indicates that the effect of sildenafil on Akt signaling (i.e. panels A-C) is upstream of Akt itself. *p&lt;0.05 vs control; <sup>f</sup>p&lt;0.05 vs TAC; C: control; T: TAC; T+S: TAC + sildenafil; applies to all panels.</p>Figures 1 IA-I IF show the anti-adrenergic effect of PDE5A inhibitors on isolated adult murine myocytes that were exposed to isoproterenol (ISO), and then to ISO in combination with sildenafil (ISO+SIL). Figures 1 IA is a trace showing that sarcomere \n\nshortening increased with ISO, but was markedly blunted by the concomitant exposure to the PDE5 inhibitor, sildenafil. Figure 1 IB shows calcium transients measured by the fluorescent dye Indo-2AM. The dye signal is expressed as a ratio of two emission wavelengths. Figures 11C and 1 ID are graphs quantitating the results shown in Figures 1 IA and 1 IB. Figures 1 IE includes two pressure volume loops showing results from intact mouse hearts. ISO produces a widening of the pressure volume loop and shift of the upper corner point (end-systole) to the left. This reflects an increase in contractility. With SIL treatment, the ISO response was blunted, and there was a negligible increase in contractility. Figure 1 IF is a graph that summarizes data based on the maximal rate of rise in pressure (dP/dt<sub>max</sub>). With ISO, there was a rise in dP/dt<sub>maz</sub>, after re-establishing baseline, sildenafil was given alone. This had no effect on the heart at rest. When ISO was added, the expected contractile rise in dP/dt<sub>max</sub> was not observed.</p>Figures 12A and 12B includes three panels (Figure 12A) and a graph (Figure 12B). Figure 12A shows the effect of PDE5A inhibition on chronic ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy in intact hearts. Figure 12B shows the effect of PDE5A inhibition on the heart weight/tibia length ratio. ISO was infused by osmotic pumps in mice for 2 weeks, resulting in a near 50% increase in left ventricular hypertrophy (mass/tibia length). Concomitant treatment with a PDE5a inhibitor prevented this response.</p>Figures 13 A and 13B are graphs showing that atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) does not suppress cardiac alterations associated with \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation as PDE5 A inhibition does. When ANP was infused intravenously, it resulted in a marked increase in myocardial cGMP (right panel). This did not inhibit isoproterenol-stimulated contractility (left panel displays the maximal rate of pressure rise; dP/dt<sub>max</sub> at baseline, with ISO, rebaseline, ANP alone, and ANP+ISO). This was very different to what was observed with a PDE5a inhibitor as shown above. The cGMP measurements with PDE5a inhibition showed little change. Without wishing to be tied to any particular theory, these results likely indicate that novel highly compartmentalized signaling underlies PDE5a's myocardial effects.</p>Figures 14A and 14B are traces showing the direct effect of a PDE5a inhibitor (sildenafil; SIL) on isoproterenol (ISO) stimulated isolated adult cardiac muscle cell contraction and calcium transients with or without inhibition of guanylate cyclase (sGC) by ODQ. sGC generates cGMP which in turn is catabolized by PDE5a. Blocking the synthesis of cGMP by sGC (ODQ) prevented the PDE5a inhibitor from blunting an ISO response. This supports the importance of a cGMP regulated mechanism for the PDE5a inhibitory effect. \n\n Figures 15 A, 15B, and 15C are graphs showing that a PDE5a inhibitor enhances cGMP in isolated adult cardiac muscle cells. Figure 15A shows Protein kinase G-I (PKG-I) activity in myocytes. Treatment with sildenafil (SIL) or tadalafil (TAD) alone slightly raised PKG-I activity (\u03c1&lt;0.05), but increased it by 70% (\u03c1&lt;0.001) when combined with ISO (30% over ISO alone, pO.OOl). Figure 15B shows cGMP production as measured by a cGMP- sensitive fluorescent energy resonance transfer (FRET) probe in control rat neonatal myocytes. SIL (500 nM) and ISO (100 nM) raised cellular cGMP (\u03c1&lt;0.01), with a greater change by their combination. Addition of the NO donor DEA/NO (5 \u03bcM) increased this further. Figure 12C shows a summary of data for relative FRET change (*p&lt;0.05 vs untreated cells).</p>Figures 16A-16E show PDE5A protein expression and activity in isolated adult myocytes and in whole cardiac myocardium. Figure 16A shows a Western blot (upper panel) for PDE5 A protein expression in isolated adult myocytes (protein loading shown) with summary data (lower panel) from 4-6 separate blots (n&gt;6 hearts in each group) displayed. A double banding pattern is observed (a, b). Loading fo",

B<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>2</sub> refer to the initial and second (i.e. after study drug) baselines, and D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> refer to data measured during dobutamine infusion before and after study drug, respectively. P values are from within-group RMANOVA testing for a change in the dobutamine-stimulated response before versus after receiving the study drug. Paired t- tests are also shown for within group comparisons OfD<sub>1</sub> versus B<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> versus B<sub>2</sub> (*p&lt;0.001, f p&lt;0.005 for this test). Sildenafil markedly reduced the dobutamine enhanced contractility as compared with placebo. There was no significant effect on total peripheral resistance however.</p>Figure 20 is a series of twelve panels showing the change in hemodynamic function due to dobutamine before (B, \u2022) versus after (A, o) receipt of study drug - sildenafil or placebo. Within-group pairings for each patient are identified by the lines connecting data points. Mean values are shown by the boxes to the right or left of each data set. The p-values above each individual graph are for a comparison between the first and second dobutamine response (change versus baseline) in each group. The p-values in bold above each pair of plots is for RMANOVA based on a 3-way interaction of dobutamine test (pre or post study drug), dobutamine (present or not), and study drug (sildenafil vs placebo).</p>Figures 21A-21F show the effect of PdE5A inhibition on NOS3 coupling and metalloproteinase activation. Figure 21 A shows hypertrophic changes in a TAC heart \n\nrelative to the normal heart of a sham mouse. Figure 21B is a Western blot performed in a non-denatured gel showing that levels of NOS3-dimers (NOS3-d) were decreased in TAC hearts at 3 weeks post-surgery, while levels of NOS3 monomers (N0S3-m) were increased. This is indicative of NOS uncoupling, wherein NOS3 converts from an enzyme which synthesizes principally nitric oxide to one that generates superoxide. Figure 21 C (lower panel) is a pair of micrographs showing dihydroethidium (DHE) - an oxidative stress sensitive dye - staining in the myocardium of sham and TAC mice. Figure 21 C (upper panel) is a pair of graphs showing that calcium dependent NOS activity to generate nitric oxide was reduced in TAC mice three weeks after surgery. Figure 2 ID is a graph showing that superoxide levels formed by NOS3 were increased. Figure 2 IE is a Western blot showing that NOS3 dimer levels (280 kD) were reduced in TAC mice three weeks after pressure- overload, and that sildenafil treatment prevented the loss of NOS dimer (280 kD band) in these animals. Figure 2 IF is a gelatinase zymogram showing that sildenafil inhibited gelatinase activity (metalloproteinase MMP-2 and MMP-9, both gelatinases)</p>Figures 22A, 22B and 22C are a Western blot (Figure 22A) and two summary graphs (Figure 22B and C) showing the effect of TAC and sildenafil treatment with TAC on the expression and activation of the small GTP-binding protein Rho A and its downstream kinase Rho kinase (ROCK 1 and ROCK 2). Figure 22A shows that RhoA and ROCK2 protein expression were increased in mice exposed to 3 -weeks of TAC. Both were blunted by PDE5A inhibition treatment by sildenafil. Figures 22B and 22C show that RhoA and total ROCK activity was increased in mice exposed to TAC for three weeks. This increase in activity was inhibited by sildenafil.</p>Figures 23 A and 23B are a series of six phospho-blots showing STAT3 phosphorylation. Figure 23A shows that STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) phosphorylation (i.e. activation) increases at one week, three weeks, and nine weeks after TAC surgery. Treatment with sildenafil prevented this activation. Figure 23B results of experiments in neonatal rat myocytes, showing that interleukin 6 (IL-6) activates STAT3 and not STATl. Treatment with sildenafil prevented the STAT activation. \u03c1-STAT3 and t-STAT3 are for phosphoryalted and total levels respectively, and similar abbreviations apply for the STATl lanes. The sildenafil effect on STAT3 was not working at the transcriptional level since t-STAT3 was unaltered. This was further confirmed by comparison to cells in which STAT3 expression is blocked by a silencing RNA (siRNA). This lowered STAT3, but reciprocally increased STATl expression and activity. This was not observed with sildenafil treatment. \n\n Figures 24 A and 24B show that sildenafil treatment enhances myocardial energetics. Figure 24A (left panel) is an NMR spectroscopic image of a TAC heart three weeks after surgery. The heart is shown in cross-section.

Compositions and methods of the invention are particularly useful for the treatment or prevention of cardiac conditions that are characterized by morphological, cellular, or molecular remodeling. Typically, such remodeling occurs in response to hemodynamic stress such as hypertension, valvular disease, neurohormonal stress, cardiac infarction, or volume over-load. This invention is based, in \n\npart, on the discoveries that PDE5 is expressed at functionally significant levels in cardiac tissue; that these levels target potent regulators of cardiac remodeling and function; and that inhibition of specific cyclic guanosine 3 ',5 '-monophosphate phosphodiesterases (PDE5) treats or prevents cardiac hypertrophy and other cardiac conditions.</p>The methods herein include administering to the subject (including a subject identified as in need of such treatment) an effective amount of a compound described herein, or a composition described herein to produce a beneficial effect on a cardiac tissue. Identifying a subject in need of such treatment can be in the judgment of a subject or a health care professional and can be subjective (e.g. opinion) or objective (e.g. measurable by a test or diagnostic method).</p>As used herein, the terms \"treat,\" treating,\" \"treatment,\" and the like refer to reducing or ameliorating a disorder and/or symptoms associated therewith. It will be appreciated that, although not precluded, treating a disorder or condition does not require that the disorder, condition or symptoms associated therewith be completely eliminated.</p>As used herein, the terms \"prevent,\" \"preventing,\" \"prevention,\" \"prophylactic treatment\" and the like refer to reducing the probability of developing a disorder or condition in a subject, who does not have, but is at risk of or susceptible to developing a disorder or condition.</p>The therapeutic methods of the invention (which include prophylactic treatment) in general comprise administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound described herein, such as a PDE5 inhibitor (e.g., vardenaf\u03cal, tadala",
    "atheter), non-invasive cardiac pressure-volume loops.</p>Prophylactic and Therapeutic Applications</p>Heart disease is typically a chronic and progressive illness that kills more than 2.4 million Americans each year. There are -500,000 new cases of heart failure per year, with an estimated 5 million patients in the United States alone having this disease. Early intervention is likely to be most effective in preserving cardiac function. Desirably, methods of the invention are used to prevent as well to reverse the morphological, cellular, and molecular remodeling that is associated with heart disease. In one embodiment, heart disease is prevented by administering an effective amount of a PDE5 inhibitor to a subject at risk of developing a cardiac condition. To determine a subject's propensity to develop a cardiac condition, the subject's cardiac risk is assessed using any standard method known in the art. The most important indicators of cardiac risk are age, hereditary factors, weight, smoking, blood pressure, exercise history, and diabetes. Other indicators of cardiac risk include the subject's lipid profile, which is typically assayed using a blood test, or any other biomarker associated with heart disease or hypertension. Other methods for assaying cardiac risk include, but are not limited to, an EKG stress test, thallium stress test, EKG, CT scan, echocardiogram, magnetic resonance imaging study, non-invasive and invasive arteriogram, and cardiac catheterization.</p>PDE5 inhibition is also useful for treating maladapative cardiac alterations that involve chamber, cellular, and molecular remodeling leading to cardiac dysfunction, hypertrophy, and dilation, and by other cardiac indications. Advantageously, the methods of the invention are useful for the reduction of morphological, cellular and molecular remodeling in cardiac tissues that are under stress related to pressure-overload, neurohormonal stress, myocardial infarction, or volume-overload. Accordingly, the methods of the invention are particularly useful in patient's having uncontrolled hypertension or any other chronic condition that places stress on the heart.</p>PDE5 Inhibitors</p>PDE5 is expressed in systemic and pulmonary arterial and venous smooth muscle cells - particularly in the corpus cavernosum. In light of this expression, PDE5 inhibitors \n\nwere initially of interest for their vasodilatory effects. Sildenafil, for example, was first studied as an anti-anginal medication in anticipation of its capacity to dilate coronary arteries. Early clinical studies of sildenafil for the treatment of angina, however, were disappointing, as its impact on arterial vasodilation was very modest. These clinical studies did lead to the finding that erectile function was improved as a common side effect of sildenafil administration. Sildenafil enhances an erection by decreasing the breakdown of cGMP and thus prolonging the vasodilatory effects induced in the penile circulation by nitric oxide in response to sexual stimulation. This same cyclic nucleotide signaling pathway mediates the smooth-muscle relaxing effects of nitric oxide necessary for normal erectile function. Down- regulation of this pathway is central to the pathophysiology of many forms of erectile dysfunction.</p>Sildenafil is selective for PDE5. Prior to the discovery reported herein, PDE5 levels in cardiac muscle were thought to be functionally insignificant. Indeed, as recently as 2003, major reviews on this class of pharmaceuticals noted no known direct influences on cardiac muscle, and minimal effects on the arterial blood pressure. This suggested that PDE5 inhibitors would not reduce the load on the left heart sufficient to alter heart function, or morphology (i.e. hypertrophy), nor modify molecular and cellular remodeling, hi fact, PDE5 plays only a minor role in regulating the heart under rest conditions \u2014 much as an automotive brake has little effect on an idling car.</p>Surprisingly, the results reported herein indicated that PDE5 A plays an important role in hearts subjected to stress, and that PDE5A inhibition prevents and reverses morphological, cellular, and molecular remodeling in hearts that are subject to stress related to pressure- overload, neurohormonal stress, myocardial infarction, or volume-overload. Surprisingly, the therapeutic effects of PDE5 inhibitors on heart function, left heart function, hypertrophy, and molecular and cellular remodeling are achieved in the complete absence of any change in the load imposed on the heart.</p>PDE5 inhibitors are known in the art, and include, but are not limited to, sildenafil (Compound 1), vardenafil (Compound 2), tadalafil (Compound 3), EMD 360527, DA 8159, or analogs thereof, or any other compound that inhibits cGMP hydrolysis by phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5). \n\n</p><img id=\"imgf000022_0001\" path=\"imgf000022_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/4709000/WO/20060302/A2/002006/02/36/03/imgf000022_0001.tif\"/></p>Compound 1</p><img id=\"imgf000022_0002\" path=\"imgf000022_0002.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/4709014/WO/20060302/A2/002006/02/36/03/imgf000022_0002.tif\"/></p>Compound 2</p><img id=\"imgf000022_0003\" path=\"imgf000022_0003.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/4709010/WO/20060302/A2/002006/02/36/03/imgf000022_0003.tif\"/></p>Compound 3 \n\n Certain compounds useful in the present invention can be represented by the structure (Formula I):</p><img id=\"imgf000023_0001\" path=\"imgf000023_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/4709015/WO/200",

TAC induced marked heart chamber and cellular hypertrophy (+100% by 3- weeks) that progressed to chamber dilation with reduced fractional shortening after 9 weeks. Both the hypertrophy and chamber remodeling were inhibited by the PDE5 A inhibitor, sildenafil, in TAC animals (Figures IA and IB), whereas sildenafil had no impact on sham- operated controls. Free plasma sildenafil concentration averaged -10 nM (Figure 2), well within the range specific for PDE5 A and similar to that achieved using standard clinical dosing. TAC induced a time-dependent increase in myocardial fibrosis and myocyte \n\nhypertrophy and both were suppressed by PDE5A inhibition (Figure 1C, e.g. 67% reduction in fibrosis in 9-week hearts, p&lt;0.0001). This effect was achieved at pharmacologically appropriate doses (Figure 2). At the 100 mg/kg/day oral dose, a free plasma sildenafil concentration of 10 nM was obtained. Separate studies performed using an alternative highly selective PDE5A inhibitor (EMD 360527) yielded identical findings (Figure 5A) supporting a drug class effect.</p>Example 2: PDE5A-inhibition reverses established hypertrophy</p>The more clinically applicable question of whether PDE5A-inhibition could reverse already existing hypertrophy was tested. Mice were exposed to TAC for 7-10 days which increased heart mass by 63% (p&lt;0.005) without chamber dilation (Figure 3A). The animals were then divided into two groups, one that received sildenafil for an additional 2 weeks, and a control group receiving vehicle only. Myocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis were observed with 1-week TAC and both reversed towards baseline with sildenafil treatment (Figure 3B). Serial echocardiography showed a gradual decline in LV mass and wall thickness, with preservation of systolic ejection in sildenafil-treated animals (Figure 3C).</p>Example 3: Cardiac function is enhanced despite sustained afterload</p>Detailed examination of heart function was performed by invasive pressure- volume (PV) analysis. Figure 4A shows PV loops measured before and during transient reduction of chamber preload to generate specific systolic and diastolic function indexes. As shown by the examples, PV loops and corresponding systolic and diastolic boundary relations shifted rightward with TAC (3 weeks) - consistent with chamber remodeling. Co-treatment with sildenafil resulted in preservation of cardiac volumes and an increase in systolic function (e.g. slope of end-systolic pressure-volume relation, solid line). Sham controls similarly treated for 3 weeks displayed no change. Cardiac function also improved when sildenafil was administered after hypertrophy was already established. Thus, PD",
    "F - ejection fraction; CO - cardiac output. Contractile systolic indexes are: dP/dt<sub>max</sub> - maximal rate of pressure rise; dP/dt^/IP - dP/dt^ normalized to instantaneous developed pressure; PMXI - power index: maximal ventricular power divided by EDV<sup>2</sup>; Msw</p>- preload recruitable stroke work<sup>3</sup>; Ees<sub>n</sub> - End-systolic elastance normalized to measured heart mass. The latter four indexes are load-independent measures of LV contractile function. Diastolic indexes are: Tau - time constant of pressure relaxation derived using a monoexponential fit incorporating a non-zero pressure asympotote<sup>4</sup>; dP/dt^ - peak rate of LV pressure decline; PFR/EDV - peak ventricular diastolic filling rate normalized to EDV. The latter reflects early diastolic properties, i.e. relaxation and passive stiffness during early filling. A higher value reflects improved diastolic function, p-values shown are for 1-way analysis of variance. A Tukey post-hoc multiple comparisons test was used to identify specific differences between groups: a) p=0.042 vs 3wkTAC+Sil; b) pO.OOl vs Con and Sildenafil 3wk; c) p&lt;0.05 vs Con, \u03c1&lt;0.001 vs 3wk TAC+Sil; d) p&lt;0.05 vs all other groups; e) \u03c1=0.02 vs Sildenafil 3wk; f) p&lt;0.005 vs Con, Sildenafil 3wk and 3wk TAC; g) p&lt;0.01 vs all other groups; h) p&lt;0.05 vs Con, Sildenafil 3wk and 3wk TAC; i) \u03c1\u03b8.05 vs Con and Sildenafil; j) \u03c1&lt;0.01 vs Con, Sildenafil 3wk and 3wk TAC; k) p&lt;0.01 vs 3wk TAC.</p>4- \n\n</p>PDE5A inhibition with EMD 360527 yielded near identical physiologic results (Figure 5B). These studies further demonstrated that PDE5A inhibition reversed the TAC- induced rise in fetal gene expression (e.g. natriuretic peptides, \u03b1-skeletal actin) and depression of phospholamban and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase expression (Figure 5C and 5D).</p>Example 4: TAC hearts have higher PDE5A activity and sildenafil-induced PKG-I activity</p>The principal downstream effecter kinase for cGMP in heart muscle is thought to be PKG-I, and elevation of PKG-I either directly (genetic activation) or by natriuretic peptide signaling impedes hypertrophic responses. The premise that chronic sildenafil augments PKG-I activity (Figure 6A) was tested. In sham controls, sildenafil had no effect on activity - consistent with its negligible effect on resting heart function. In TAC hearts, PDE5 A inhibition more than doubled PKG-I activity. This result suggests that PDE5A activity is selectively enhanced in hypertrophied myocardium. cGMP-esterase activity and the component of activity attributable to PDE5A (Figure 6B) was therefore measured. In sham controls, PDE5A contributed 35-45% of total activity, similar to data obtained in the dog<sup>1</sup>. In TAC hearts, total cGMP-esterase activity increased 20% over controls (p&lt;0.005), and the component attributable to PDE5A was 60% of this total (pO.OOl vs control). Thus, TAC raised PDE5A activity which in turn likely explained the augmented effect of its inhibition by sildenafil on PKG-I activation.</p>The impact of PDE5A inhibition on cGMP-dependent signaling was not, however, mirrored by total myocardial cGMP levels (Figure 6C). Baseline cGMP did not change with sildenafil treatment in sham controls. While cGMP rose in TAC hearts, it declined when these hearts were co-treated with sildenafil. Identical findings were confirmed in separate studies using an alternative PDE5A inhibitor (Figure 5D). This likely reflects concomitant changes in cGMP synthesis (i.e. associated with the prevention of hypertrophy and wall stretch) as suggested by a decline in natriuretic peptide expression (Figure 5C). PDE5A- inhibition did not alter myocardial cAMP levels in either basal or TAC conditions.</p>Example 5: PDE5A-inhibition suppresses calcineurin/NFAT and ERK1/2 activation</p>Activation of the phosphatase calcineurin couples to nuclear migration of NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cell) transcription factors that in turn induce cardiac hypertrophy and chamber remodeling<sup>2</sup>'<sup>3</sup>. This pathway can be inhibited by PKG-I, as \n\noverexpression of activated PKG-I in neonatal myocytes suppresses calcineurin/NFAT activation and cellular hypertrophy<sup>4</sup>. Accordingly, calcineurin expression in TAC hearts was examined with or without sildenafil treatment. Calcineurin protein expression rose &gt;2-fold after 1 and 9 weeks of TAC, and was significantly reduced by sildenafil at both time points (Figure 6D).</p>The mitogen activated kinase ERK1/2 is induced by stretch and G<sub>\u03b1q</sub>-receptor coupled signaling<sup>5</sup>'<sup>6</sup> and by calcineurin activation<sup>7</sup>, and is itself a contributor to hypertrophy<sup>8</sup>. After 1- week of TAC, ERK1/2 was activated (increase in phospho/total ERK1/2) and this too was suppressed by sildenafil treatment. However, after 9-weeks, ERK1/2 activation returned to baseline (despite persistent elevation of calcineurin) and sildenafil had no demonstrable effect (Figure 6D).</p>To clarify how PDE5 A inhibition influenced calcineurin/NFAT-dependent hypertrophy this signaling in neonatal rat myocytes, was assessed. Incubation with phenylephrine (PE) induced cellular hypertrophy as assessed by sarcomere organization (\u03b1- actinin, Figure 7A) and de novo protein synthesis ([<sup>3</sup>H] - leucine incorporation, Figure 7B). This was suppressed by concomitant sildenafil treatment. To test whether sildenafil inhibited NFAT activation, myocytes were transfected with an adenovirus expressing the NFAT promoter coupled to \u03b2-galactosidase. Transfection efficiency was consistently &gt;95% (Figures 8A-8F). Myocytes were then incubated with PE, the calcium activator BayK8644 (BK), or an adenovirus expressing constitutively active murine calcineurin A (AdCn). All three triggers enhanced NFAT promoter activity. Sildenafil suppressed activation stimulated by PE or BK, but not AdCn (Figure 7C). Summary results based on \u03b2-galactosidase activity assay are shown in Figure 7D. Studies performed using an alternative adenovirus with the NFAT promoter coupled to luciferase yielded identical results (Figures 9A-9C). These findings are concordant with prior data in which neonatal myocytes were transfected with constitutively active PKG-I<sup>4</sup>, and support a target upstream of calcineurin itself.</p>Example 6: PDE5A-inhibition inactivates Akt by upstream inhibition</p>Another prominent signaling cascade stimulated by pressure-overload and whose hyperactivation is associated with cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling is the Akt/PI3K pathway. Akt activation occurs at modest levels with physiologic stress, but at higher levels, triggers pathologic remodeling and heart failure<sup>9</sup>'<sup>10</sup>'<sup>11</sup>. TAC increased Akt activity as shown both by the ratio of phosphorylated/total Akt protein expression (Figure 10A) and activity assay (Figure 10B). This was particularly prominent in the later-stage of pressure-load (9- \n\nweeks). Sildenafil suppressed this response at both time points to near baseline (Figures 1OA and 10B). Akt is activated by phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PBK)<sup>11</sup>'<sup>12</sup>. In particular, PBK\u03b1 hyperactivity has been linked to myocyte hypertrophy<sup>13</sup>, whereas the gamma isoform is associated with contractile dysfunction due to suppression of cAMP<sup>13</sup>'<sup>14</sup>. Given the preserved contractile function (Figure 3) and unaltered cAMP at 3-week TAC, PBK\u03b1 activity was assessed. PBK\u03b1 activity increased with TAC. This increase was suppressed by sildenafil co- treatment (Figure 10C).</p>To test whether PDE5 A-inhibition interferes with downstream Akt signaling, we examined the glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2(GSK3\u03b2)<sup>15</sup>, which is phosphorylated by Akt as well as other kinases<sup>16</sup> (e.g. PKA<sup>17</sup>, and PKC<sup>18</sup>), leading to dis-inhibition of its intrinsic anti- hypertrophic activity<sup>19</sup>. At 1-week, phosphorylated/total GKS3B expression rose 2-fold by TAC, yet despite the decline in Akt activity by sildenafil treatment, GSK3B activation remained unchanged (Figure 10D). After 9-weeks of TAC, however, Akt and GSK3\u03b2 , activation were much more stimulated, and PDE5 A inhibition now reduced both. These data support Akt-independent activation of GSK3B particularly in early (non-dilated) phases of TAC not influenced by cGMP/PKG-l/PDE5A, and Akt-dependent activation of GSK3B that is blunted by sildenafil.</p>To further test whether inhibition of Akt-activation by sildenafil operates through downstream signaling pathways, transgenic mice with cardiac-targeted overexpression of constituitively activated Akt (AktTG) were chronically treated with vehicle or sildenafil, hi vehicle-treated animals (age 4-5 months), AktTG hearts were larger and had reduced heart function (Figure 1OE and Table 3). \n\n</p>Table 3: Hemodynamic analysis of non-transgenic controls (NTG) and transgenics with cardiac-targeted Akt overexpresion (AktTG).

Both systolic and diastolic function remained depressed in AktTG animals despite sildenafil treatment (Table 3). These findings suggest that sildenafil acts upstream of Akt activation, consistent with the PI3K enzyme activity results.</p>These results indicate the novel and potent efficacy of PDE5A inhibition to suppress chamber, cellular, and molecular remodeling while enhancing cardiac function in hearts exposed to sustained pressure-overload. Inhibition of PDE5A also reversed pre-existing hypertrophy while improving function - again despite persistent load increase. Small molecule approaches that suppress (or reverse) hypertrophy to the extent observed in the present study are uncommon, suggesting the underlying mechanism(s) linked to PDE5A/cGMP/PKG-l modulation are potent and likely interfere with several pathways. Given the simplicity of the therapy and existing wide clinical experience and safety record of PDE5A inhibitors, they are useful for the treatment of virtually any cardiac condition characterized by morphologic, cellular, or molecular hypertrophic remodeling.</p>These findings are particularly intriguing in light of the minimal influence that PDE5A inhibition has been previously thought to have on the heart<sup>19</sup>'<sup>2</sup> . Earlier studies focused almost exclusively on acute effects and/or responses in normal hearts at rest. Cardiac PDE5A expression levels are low<sup>1</sup>'<sup>21</sup>, and the acute effect of PDE5A inhibition on basal function is minimal<sup>1</sup>'<sup>19</sup>'<sup>21</sup>. Recent studies in two different species have found PDE5A can potently regulate beta-adrenergic heart and cardiac myocyte stimulation, and that this effect is coupled to its strategic localization at z-band structures<sup>1</sup>'<sup>21</sup>. The current study shows that even chronic PDE5 A inhibition has negligible effect on the normal heart, but that this situation changes dramatically in hearts under chronic loading stress. This is explained in part by greater PDE5 A-dependent cGMP-esterase activity in the pressure-loaded hearts than controls, which resulted in much larger changes in PKG-I activation following PDE5A inhibition. Analogous counter regulation of cGMP catabolic enzymes when cGMP synthesis is stimulated has been reported in vasculature (PDElA increasing with chronic nitrate infusion as a mechanism of nitrate intolerance<sup>22</sup>) and the kidney (PDE5A increasing with chronic volume load as a mechanism for renal desensitization to natriuretic peptide<sup>23</sup>). The current results are the first to reveal such regulation in the heart.</p>Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, enhanced activation of PDE5A and its role in cGMP homeostasis may be explained by several mechanisms. PDE5A activity is enhanced by cGMP - both by direct binding to a GAF domain<sup>24</sup>, and by activating PKG-I \n\nwhich phosphorylates PDE5A in a regulatory domain to enhance catalytic activity<sup>25</sup>. Both events enhance esterase activity - serving as a negative feedback loop to modulate cGMP levels. In addition, cGMP-dependent signaling appears generally more potent in hearts under stress - much like an automotive brake. For example, nitric oxide stimulated cGMP synthesis has minimal effects on basal contractility, but is more potent under adrenergic or other stress<sup>26</sup>'<sup>27</sup>. Acute PDE5 A-inhibition also has minimal effects on basal function, yet suppresses \u03b2-adrenergic stimulated cardiac contractility<sup>1</sup> in the conscious dog.</p>Prior studies regarding cGMP/PKG-1 suppression of hypertrophy have primarily targeted natriuretic peptide-dependent synthesis. Cardiac deletion of the ANP receptor<sup>28</sup>'<sup>29</sup>' <sup>3010,40,41</sup> <sub>exacer</sub>b<sub>a</sub>t<sub>es</sub> load-induced hypertrophy, whereas modest chamber hypertrophy can be prevented by myocyte-targeted overexpression of a constitutively activated ANP-receptor guanylate cyclase domain<sup>31</sup>. These changes are accompanied by decreases or increases in myocardial cGMP. However, unlike ANP-coupled signaling, inhibiting PDE5A generates a potent anti-hypertrophic effect without an apparent increase in total myocardial cGMP - and despite greatly enhanced PKG-I activity. This indicates that total myocardial levels do not necessarily reflect cGMP-signaling. It is highly likely that alterations in cGMP signaling exist within localized sub-domains within the cell. Recent studies from other laboratories support this contention, and in particular the notion that specific PDEs target the degradation of cGMP depending upon the enzyme responsible for its synthesis. cGMP binding to PKG-I allosteric sites is thought to be an important mechanism for its sequestration from the cytosol and a means of protecting it from PDE5A hydrolysis<sup>32</sup>. This could underlie enhanced PKG-I activation despite the lack of commensurate increases in cGMP. Compartmentalized signaling is further supported by enhanced PDE5 A expression near z-band structures in heart muscle cells and the loss of physiologic activity when this localization is altered<sup>1</sup>. Total cGMP may particularly reflect the synthetic pathway involved, with higher levels induced by natriuretic peptide stimulation. Hearts treated with sildenafil had reduced wall stress and ANP/BNP expression; thus, some decline in cGMP might be expected.</p>Sustained pressure-load activates multiple kinases and phosphatases, and selective targeting of many of these proteins by genetic engineering has revealed potent involvement in the cardiac hypertrophic response. PDE5 A inhibition appeared to counter several pathways, and while it is always possible that the observed changes were secondary to an as yet unidentified primary effecter, this seems to be unlikely because of the following reasons. First, as with PKA-dependent signaling, it is known that cGMP/PKG-1 signaling can impact multiple enzyme cascades<sup>4</sup>'<sup>33</sup>'<sup>34</sup> including calcineurin. Secondly, the changes observed in \n\nERK1/2, Akt, PI3K\u03b3, and calcineurin in response to sustained pressure-load were each in ranges shown individually to stimulate myocardial hypertrophy and/or remodeling in various genetic models ' ' ' , making a single culprit less likely. And thirdly, the amplitudes and time-course of the changes observed are incompatible with a single effecter based on results from genetically engineered models. For example, although ERK 1/2 activation increases in mice overexpressing calcineurin <sup>35</sup>'<sup>36</sup>, ERKl/2 phosphorylation was negligible after 9-weeks TAC despite persistent calcineurin stimulation. Genetic inhibition of calcineurin in TAC- mice does not reverse ERKl/2 activation<sup>35</sup>, yet declines in both were observed with sildenafil administration. Calcineurin -overexpression also triggers Akt activation<sup>36</sup>, but at much lower levels than was observed with TAC. This could not explain the temporal disparities in Akt and calcineurin changes. Mice lacking the PBK inhibitor PTEN develop myocyte hypertrophy and systolic dysfunction, as well as Akt and GSK3B activation, but do not display ERKl/2 activation<sup>13</sup>. In addition, genetic enhancement of Akt or PBK activity to levels similar to those achieved by TAC in the present study induces systolic dysfunction<sup>13</sup> and chamber dilation ' , yet is not associated with calcineurin co-stimulation . Collectively, these discrepancies suggest that more than one pathway is targeted by PDE5A- inhibition.</p>The apparent discrepancy between Akt and GSK3B suppression by sildenafil after 1- week TAC deserves comment. GSK3B is activated by TAC, and by itself is associated with hypertrophy<sup>1</sup> and cardiac dysfunction<sup>39</sup>. However, GSK3B can also be phosphorylated by PKA via anchoring kinase AKAP220<sup>17</sup>, by PKC\u03b3<sup>18</sup>, and other kinases<sup>16</sup>. Given the decline in Akt activation despite sustained GSK3B phosphorylation, one or more of these Akt- independent pathways appear to be involved - yet not regulated by PDE5A-inhibition. The later stage of hypertrophy was marked by substantial remodeling and greater Akt and GSK3B activation. Inhibition of both by sildenafil at this stage could underlie the sustained benefit.</p>Although cardiac hypertrophy has been traditionally thought of as an adaptive response to loading stress, evidence suggests it may not be a required compensation<sup>37</sup>. While sildenafil did not fully reverse or impede the marked hypertrophy, chamber and molecular remodeling observed after weeks to several months of TAC, cardiac function improved despite the sustained load. The current findings are of clinical interest given the high prevalence of hypertensive heart disease and hypertrophy that play a prominent role in many forms of heart failure. The expanding use of oral PDE5A inhibitors to treat disorders such as pulmonary hypertension<sup>40</sup> and not only erectile dysfunction, is supporting their use as a chronic therapy. \n\nExample 7: PDE5a inhibitor blunts cardiac muscle cell response to isoproterenol</p>Isoproterenol, a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor agonist stimulates cardiac muscle cell contraction. A PDE5a inhibitor (sildenafil, 100 nM) blunted the enhanced contraction of primary isolated cardiac muscle cells in response to stimulation by the adrenergic agonist - isoproterenol (Figures 1 IA-I ID). This blunting is prevented if soluble guanylate cyclase is inhibited with ODQ, a soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) inhibitor (Figures 14A and 14B). This indicates that PDE5a inhibitors modify cardiac function by regulating cGMP, which is generated by sGC. Thus, the mechanism of action for PDE5a inhibitors is likely to be different from the mechanism proposed for activation of ATP sensitive potassium channels which may modify post-ischemic function. These data also definitively show that the effect of PDE5 inhibitors does not depend on arterial vasodilation or in fact on any arterial changes at all.</p>Example 8: PDE5A inhibition stimulates PKG-I and cGMP</p>To directly determine whether PDE5A inhibition stimulated PKG-I in adult myocytes (Figure 15A), the effect of PDE5A inhibition on protein kinase G 1 (PKG-I) was tested with sildenafil alone, isoproterenol alone, both combined, tadalafil alone, and tadalafil combined with isoproterenol. PDE5A inhibition slightly enhanced PKG-I activity under basal conditions (-10%, p&lt;0.05). When isoproterenol was combined with either PDE5a inhibitor, there was a marked 50% rise in PKG activity. This is consistent with the anticipated effect of inhibiting PDE5a, which is expected to increase cGMP levels, which then activate PKG. To directly monitor intracellular cGMP production, a fluorescence resonance energy transfer probe sensitive to cGMP levels was used in neonatal rat myocytes (Figures 15B and 15C). Isoproterenol, sildenafil, and the NO donor (DEA/NO) all enhanced the FRET signal, providing the first direct demonstration that PDE5 A inhibition enhances cGMP in myocytes (Figures 15 A-15C).</p>Example 9: PDE5A inhibition blocks \u03b2-adrenergic stimulated contractility, and chronically prevents adrenergic-stimulated cardiac hypertrophy</p>Acute increases in cardiac chamber contractility were induced by isoproterenol infusion in control C57bl6 mice. The increase in cardiac systolic function was assessed by in vivo pressure-volume relations (Figure 1 IE), and is reflected by a widening of the loop and \n\nshift of the upper left corner to the left. Sildenafil delivered intravenously at a dose that yielded a free plasma concentration of 30 nM results in a marked suppression of this adrenergic stimulation response. This supports the myocyte effects at the intact heart level. Furthermore, if isoproterenol is infused chronically by means of an implanted osmotic mini- pump, the heart responds by increasing the cardiac mass (hypertrophy) and with some dilation. This is shown for a group of control C57bl6 mice (Figures 12A and 12B). Co- treatment with a PDE5a inhibitor (EMD 360527) markedly inhibited the development of cardiac hypertrophy.</p>Importantly, the efficacy of PDE5a inhibition to block \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation is specific to the intervention, and not duplicated by other methods to enhance myocardial cGMP. Figure 13 A shows the effect of stimulating cGMP in the myocardium by atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) infusion on the isoproterenol cardiac response. Unlike the data provided in Figure 1 IF using a PDE5a inhibitor, ANP had no effect on the ISO response in the intact heart. Figure 13B shows the measured levels of cGMP in the myocardium in hearts under control conditions, and those exposed to intravenous PDE5a inhibition (EM 360527) or ANP. The latter induced a marked rise in myocardial cGMP - yet had no effect on the sympathetic stimulatory response. The PDE5a inhibitor, on the other hand, had negligible effect on measured whole myocardial cGMP, yet this was very potent as a negative regulator of beta-adrenergic stimulation. Lack of measured cGMP rise in heart due to PDE5a inhibitors has been previously used to support a lack of significant physiologic role in the heart. However, these data show that the signal is highly compartmentalized, an that precisely the correct region is modulated by PDE5a inhibition to have the impact on cardiac contractility, and that this is not simply mimicked by enhancing cGMP by synthetic means.</p>Example 10: PDE5A expression and in vitro activity</p>PDE5A mRNA expression was 100-fold lower in isolated myocytes than in lung (Figure 16B). Protein expression was observed in isolated adult cardiac myocytes, but again the level was much lower than in lung (Figure 16A). The SDS-PAGE gel shows loading with 1 \u03bcg in lung, compared to 10Ox that amount for the heart to match the density level. Previous reports had shown that PDE5A is expressed at low levels in myocytes, and this low level of expression had lead to the assertion that PDE5 A does not play a functionally significant role in cardiac muscle cells. Protein and gene expression was also found to be diminished in whole heart compared with lung (Figure 16C). In lung, it resides primarily in the vascular \n\nsmooth muscle cells. Here, the SDS-PAGE gel was loaded with 20 \u03bcg of myocardial-derived or lung-derived protein, and the relative expression differences are very apparent. This is supported by disparities in the mRNA expression between these tissues (Figure 16A). In the whole heart, a prominent band was observed at -95 kDa in isolated myocytes that was approximately the same size as the band observed in lung. A second ~70kDa band was consistently observed in heart tissue that either reflected a splice variant or a proteolytic fragment. Similar findings were obtained with alternative antibodies<sup>41</sup>'<sup>42</sup>.</p>Total cGMP and PDE5a-dependent cGMP esterase activity were determined for adult isolated myocytes and for intact heart myocardium (Figures 16D and 16E). Co-incubation of either tissue with IBMX, a broad spectrum PDE inhibitor, lowered cGMP-esterase activity by -90%. Co-incubation of either tissue extract with sildenafil (SIL) - a selective PDE5a inhibitor, revealed only the component of cGMP normally catabolized by PDE5A. This was approximately 30% in both isolated myocytes, and the whole heart. Similar results for PDE5A-dependent cGMP-esterase activity were obtained by by radio-enzyme assay<sup>41</sup> (32\u00b17.3% -NTG (n=9)).</p>Prior studies have reported low-levels of PDE5A expression in the myocardium<sup>43</sup>'<sup>44</sup> and minimal effects of PDE5A inhibition on resting heart function<sup>41</sup>'<sup>45</sup>'<sup>46</sup>'<sup>47</sup>, which led to the erroneous conclusion that PDE5 A plays little role in the heart. In contrast to previous reports, the present studies show that this low level of expression does not indicate that PDE5 A lacks physiologic function. Rather, the current results indicated that PDE5 A plays an important function in \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation, and in cardiac remodeling, hypertrophy, and dysfunction to chronic stress. The effects from preventing cGMP catabolism by inhibiting PDE5a appear to be substantially greater than those reported from increasing cGMP synthesis by natriuretic peptide-coupled synthesis <sup>48</sup>'<sup>49</sup>, or adrenergic stimulated contractility changes. This supports a very novel mechanism that has not been previously appreciated or recognized by which targeted cGMP manipulation can directly influence the heart muscle cell and thus heart itself.</p>Example 11: Myocyte localization of PDE5A</p>PDE5A was present throughout the cardiomyocyte (Figures 17A- 17F) and also localized to z-band striations (Figure 17A (left panel), (right panel)-\u03b1 -actinin). PDE5A immunostaining was inhibited by a specific blocking peptide (Figure 17B,left) whereas this same peptide did not block PDElC staining (Figure 17C,left), supporting assay specificity. \n\nPDE5A was present at z-band striations (Figures 17D and 17F), and colocalizes with the NO synthetic enzyme NOS3.</p>Example 12: Baseline Analysis and Sildenafil Effect</p>PDE5 A is expressed at low levels in the myocardium<sup>51\"53</sup>, and its inhibition by sildenafil or other agents has not been thought to directly affect heart function as these drugs induce only a slight decline in arterial pressure and have no apparent effect on cardiac ejection fraction or output at rest <sup>54</sup>'<sup>55</sup> or during exercise.<sup>56</sup>'<sup>57</sup> As reported above, despite low expression levels, PDE5 A can exert potent localized regulation over adrenergic stimulation <sup>58</sup>'<sup>59</sup>, and its chronic inhibition markedly limits and reverses cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling stimulated by pressure overload.<sup>60</sup> These results support the therapeutic use of PDE5 A inhibitors in treating or preventing cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling.</p>To determine whether sildenafil pretreatment suppresses beta-adrenergic stimulated cardiac contractility in healthy human subjects, a randomized, double-blinded, placebo- controlled, non-invasive hemodynamic study was performed, employing dobutamine stress testing before and after administration of oral sildenafil or placebo.</p>Dobutamine is an adrenergic beta-1 agonist that has a positive inotropic effect and is used clinically to pharmacologically stimulate (and stress) cardiac tissue and increase heart pump function. Sildenafil inhibits phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5A) to elevate intracellular cyclic GMP and induce vasodilation. As reported herein, sildenafil also potently effected hearts stimulated by beta-adrenergic receptor agonists or pressure overloads. To determine whether sildenafil blunts dobutamine-stimulated cardiac function in humans, thirty-five healthy volunteers underwent a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which cardiac function was assessed in response to dobutamine before and after oral sildenafil (100 mg, n=19) or placebo (n=16). Echo-Doppler and noninvasive blood pressure data yielded load-independent contractility indexes (maximal power index and end-systolic elastance), ejection fraction, and",
    " Table 1. \n\n</p>For the first test, early (E) and late (A) diastolic filling rates rose similarly in both groups, and E/A ratio rose slightly. Sildenafil resulted in a borderline decline in E velocity (p=0.06), slightly raised A velocity (p=O.03), and thus decline in E/A ratio (p=0.007). Dobutamine-stimulated an increase in tissue Doppler. E' velocity was also blunted by sildenafil (p=0.002). Dobutamine's effect on E/E' ratio, an index of LV end-diastolic pressure, and isovolumic relaxation time were unaltered by the study drug in either group. Importantly, between-group analysis revealed no significant interaction of study drug on the dobutamine-change in diastolic function for any of the parameters (p values shown are for 3- way RMANOVA as used in the systolic analysis).</p>Li the initial dobutamine test, systolic and diastolic function improved similarly in both treatment groups (e.g. peak power index rose 80\u00b128% - placebo, 82\u00b131% - sildenafil group, p=NS). In subjects who then received sildenafil, their second dobutamine response was significantly blunted, with peak power, ejection fraction, and end-systolic elastance changes all reduced by 32\u00b134%, 66\u00b164%, and 56\u00b163%, respectively (each p&lt;0.001 versus the initial response). This contrasted to the placebo group that displayed similar functional responses with both dobutamine tests. Sildenafil treatment did not significantly alter diastolic changes induced by dobutamine when compared to results with placebo. Thus, PDE5A inhibition by sildenafil blunts systolic responses to beta-adrenergic stimulation. This supports activity of PDE5A in the human heart and its role in modifying stimulated cardiac function.</p>This study reports the first direct evidence that sildenafil influences cardiac function in healthy humans, suppressing beta-adrenergic stimulated systolic function while having minimal effect under resting conditions. Importantly, this inhibitory effect did not depend on afterload or cardiac preload changes. This indicates that PDE5 A inhibition can modify the cardiac stress response in humans.</p>PDE5A inhibitors have potent effects on vascular beds and tissues<sup>61</sup>'<sup>62</sup>. In addition, Sildenafil reduces pulmonary arterial resistance and may be effective in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension.<sup>63</sup>'<sup>64</sup> It also improves endothelial function, a marker of nitric oxide bioavailability and overall vascular health, in smokers<sup>65</sup> and patients with heart failure<sup>66</sup>. Animal studies have shown that sildenafil impressively reduces infarct size via an ischemic preconditioning-like effect.<sup>67</sup>'<sup>68</sup></p>Following an early case report suggesting that PDE5 A inhibitors might increase the risk of heart attack<sup>69</sup>, several studies have attempted to define the cardiac effects of this class of drugs. In a study of 14 men with coronary artery disease, Herrmann, et al. reported that \n\n100 mg of oral sildenafil slightly reduced resting systemic and pulmonary pressures, but had no effect on heart rate, left ventricular filling pressures or cardiac output.<sup>54</sup> In a subsequent study, men with known or suspected coronary disease underwent supine bicycle exercise testing, and sildenafil again slightly lowered blood pressure, but did not alter baseline or exercise-stimulated heart rate, blood pressure, exercise duration, or functional reserve.<sup>56</sup> Other investigations found only modest improvement in exercise performance<sup>57</sup> or prolongation of the time required to reach ischemic ST segment depression.<sup>70</sup></p>Direct analysis of cardiac effects has been obtained in vitro, but these results remained limited and conflicting. PDE5 A gene expression is present in human heart<sup>52</sup>'<sup>59</sup>, although protein expression and enzyme activity have been questioned<sup>51</sup>'<sup>53</sup>'<sup>71</sup> Recent evidence has found that while gene and protein expression are indeed low, PDE5A is compartmentalized within the myocyte, and its inhibition is capable of altering heart and myocyte function. This is not observed under rest conditions, but only when the heart is stimulated, for example by beta-adrenergic agonists<sup>58</sup>'<sup>59</sup> or pressure overload<sup>60</sup>. Beta-stimulation co-activates adenylate cyclase to increase cyclic 3'5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) as well as guanylate cyclase to generate cGMP.<sup>72</sup> The former activates protein kinase A, which enhances contractility by targeting calcium handling and myofilament interaction, whereas the latter acts as a \"brake\" to oppose this effect. This is achieved in part by activating dual-substrate PDEs that break down cAMP<sup>73</sup>, and protein kinase G, which counteracts multiple cAMP/protein kinase A effects within heart cells.<sup>72</sup>'<sup>74</sup>'<sup>75</sup></p>The results reported herein provide the first description of anti-adrenergic efficacy of PDE5a inhibition in humans. Cardiac function was studied both at rest and during adrenergic stimulation using various parameters specific to the heart and less dependent on changes in cardiac loading<sup>76</sup>'<sup>77</sup> Although re-baseline contractility was slightly (but significantly) higher in the group receiving sildenafil, this did not explain the findings since the peak response was itself significantly lowered. Without wishing to be tied to one particular theory, these results cannot rule out a possible role of receptor desensitization due to sildenafil, although the prior evidence supporting a primary role of intracellular cGMP/PKG signaling <sup>59</sup> supports a more distal mechanism. The dobutamine-stress test rather than exercise was employed as this provided a more specific assessment of adrenergic regulation by sildenafil. Indeed, even healthy subjects acutely administered beta blockers display no change in overall exercise stress test performance or maximal cardiac output - despite clear effects on adrenergic stimulated contractility. The cardiac power index provides a sensitive load-independent \n\nindex of contractility <sup>51\"64</sup>' <sup>72</sup>'<sup>74</sup>'<sup>76&gt;77&gt;79</sup>-<sup>84</sup> that is little influenced by arterial or venous vasodilation<sup>76</sup>.</p>Unlike systolic changes, dobutamine-stimulated diastolic function was not significantly blunted by sildenafil treatment when compared between groups. Within group analysis did show",
    "e infusion after sildenafil. This decline in net ventricular ejection could limit early diastolic recoil (suction) effects that contribute to early rapid filling of the heart. This in turn would result in augmented filling during atrial systole, particularly as end diastolic volumes were similar in both groups. The E/E' velocity ratio had been shown to correlate well with left ventricular diastolic pressure.<sup>39</sup> E/E' was similar in both groups at baseline or with dobutamine, and importantly there was no evidence that left ventricular diastolic pressure increased with sildenafil, despite blunted systolic augmentation. The sample size may also have contributed to the lack of diastolic effects, since noninvasive measures of diastole can have greater variance.</p><sup>\u25a0</sup> Sildenafil has been reported to increase sympathetic nerve activity without altering heart rate or blood pressure<sup>85</sup>, and this could have played a role in the slight rise in basal contractility at second baseline in subjects receiving sildenafil. Such activity might be anticipated to down-regulate adrenergic stimulation, thereby blunting a dobutamine response. The changes were small but consistent with slight increases in plasma catecholamines with sildenafil (~70 pg/mL)<sup>86</sup>, and about 3-4 orders of magnitude lower than that expected from dobutamine. Furthermore, there was no statistical difference in the between-group analysis. Sildenafil has also been reported to decrease vagal inhibition on heart rate<sup>87</sup> and in one study increased heart rate by nearly 10% after a single dose.<sup>88</sup> This may explain the enhanced heart rate response to dobutamine after sildenafil in this study. A higher heart rate per se would be expected to increase contractility, by the force-frequency relationship, whereas the opposite effect was true in this analysis of the sildenafil group.</p>Sildenafil can potently suppress adrenergic-stimulated contractility in the intact human heart. Previous studies have shown that Sildenafil and other PDE5 A inhibitors are safe and effective for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in healthy individuals<sup>80</sup>, patients with coronary disease<sup>54</sup>'<sup>56</sup>, and patients with heart failure<sup>57</sup>. In contrast to previous reports that indicated that PDE5 A inhibitors have no effect on the human heart, the results reported \n\nherein indicate that PDE5A inhibitors are important regulators of cardiac function in the presence of catecholamine stimulation. Blunting of adrenergic stimulation will likely prove beneficial for other disorders in which neurohormonal stimulation is enhanced, such as hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, and heart failure.</p>Example 15: PDE5A inhibits cardiac molecular remodeling</p>While the morphological changes in the heart are the most dramatic changes associated with cardiac remodeling, these morphological changes arise in response to earlier alterations gene transcription and protein activity (Figures 21 A-F). PDE5 A inhibition treatment prevents eNOS (NOS3) uncoupling and limits activation of metalloproteinases. Chronic aortic banding (TAC) results in loss of the normal dimer (higher mw form) of NOS3 (Figure 21 B). This resulted in activation of reactive oxygen species as shown in Figure 21C. This figure shows positive staining detected by dihydroethidide. This is accompanied by a reduction in the calcium dependent NOS3 activity (Figure 21C), and an increase in the amount of superoxide formed by NOS3 (Figure 21D).</p>In addition, PDE5 A inhibition prevents the loss of NOS dimer formation - supporting an important novel mechanism by which PDE5a inhibition can limit oxidant stress in the hypertrophied and failing heart (Figure 21E). Figure 21F shows that sildenafil inhibits the metalloproteinase activity of gelatinase. Marked gel lysis is observed with chronic TAC Figure 21E (3W TAC). This activity is largely inhibited by co-treatment with sildenafil. Since activation of gelatinases are coupled to cardiac chamber remodeling and dilation, this indicates that that PDE5a inhibition can inhibit metalloproteinase 's role in the molecular remodeling that is associated with heart failure and hypertrophy.</p>Increases in RhoA and Rho-kinase expression and activity are observed in chronic aortic banding (TAC) (Figures 21A-21C). Sildenafil inhibits RhoA, Rho-Kinasel (ROCKl) and Rho-Kinase2 protein expression and activity (ROCK2) (Figures 22A-22C). Increases in rhoA and rho-kinase are associated with the molecular remodeling that precedes cardiac hypertrophy and dilation. By inhibiting alterations in these molecules, sildenafil is useful for the treatment of molecular remodeling.</p>Increases in STAT3 phosphorylation, which activate STAT3, are associated with TAC (Figures 23 A and B). Sildenafil inhibits activation of STAT3 (Figure 23A). Thus, sildenafil inhibits the molecular remodeling associated with alterations in STAT3 activity. \n\nExample 16: Sildenafil improves myocardial energetics</p>Sildenafil treatment improves myocardial energetics. Mice were exposed to TAC for three weeks. Hearts were then evaluated using in vivo NMR spectroscopy to assess high energy phosphate metabolism. An exemplary image and spectra are shown at Figures 24A and 24B. The ratio of phosphocreatine (PCr) to total ATP is used as a measure of energy reserve and balance. TAC significantly lowers this ratio, while treatment with sildenafil preserves the normal energy balance. This indicates that PDE5 A inhibition improves myocardial energetics and enhances cardiac energy reserves under stress.</p>The results reported herein were carried out with the following materials and methods.</p>Animal models</p>Male C57BL/6 mice (8 -11 weeks, Jackson Laboratories) were used. Pressure overload was produced by transverse aortic constriction. Acute and chronic mortality of the banding procedure was &lt;5%. Sham-operated mice underwent the same operation, but without aortic constriction. Oral treatment with PDE5 inhibitors was provided by mixing drug into semi-soft rodent chow (Bioserv; 4-6 g/day) that also provided full daily nutrition. Controls were treated with drug vehicle mixed in the food. Male transgenic mice with cardiac specific overexpression of a constitutively active Akt (16-20 weeks),<sup>89</sup> and litter mate controls were treated with vehicle or PDE5 inhibitor in the same way.</p>PDE5A inhibitors</p>Sildenafil citrate (Viagra\u00ae, Pfizer), EMD 360527 (Merck KgA) and tadalafil (Cialis\u00ae, Eli Lilly) were used in the study. For in vivo chronic studies, 100 mg/kg/day of sildenafil was used yielding a mean free plasma concentration of 10.4 \u00b1 2.3 nM (IC<sub>50</sub> 5-10 nM). This is comparable to levels obtained in humans at 1 mg/kg/day, and reflects the near 100-fold higher metabolism of sildenafil in the mouse. 1.5 g/kg/day of EMD 360527 was used yielding a plasma concentration of 4\u03bcM for EMD 360527 (IC50 1 \u03bcM in ex vivo vascular rings). 10OnM or 1 \u03bcM of sildenafil was used for cGMP-PDE activity assay and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes studies. 5OnM of tadalafil was used in cGMP-PDE activity assay.</p>Physiological Studies</p>Transthoracic two-dimensional guided M-mode echocardiography was performed in non-anesthetized mice. Measurements were done using an echocardiography system, the \n\nSEQUOIA C256 (Siemens, Munich, DE) with the 15MHz linear-array transducer. Intact heart hemodynamic analysis was performed as described<sup>90</sup>.

PDE5A was inhibited in vivo with sildenafil (100 \u03bcg/kg/min; 37\u00b15.2 nM free plasma concentration); or EMD-360527/5 (Merck KgA,Germany , 160-300 \u03bcg/kg/min). Both compounds have an IC<sub>50</sub> of -10 nM for purified PDE5A (vs 1-20 \u03bcM for PDEl or PDE3). In vitro studies used 0.1-1 \u03bcM sildenafil (SIL), 0.05 \u03bcM tadalafil (prepared in IX PBS), or 0.1 \u03bcM EMD-360527/5 in buffered 1% propanediol. In vivo and in vitro studies of vehicles alone confirmed no effects.</p>In vivo studies</p>Isoproterenol (ISO: 20 ng/kg/minutes i.v. x 5 min) with or without PDE5A inhibitor was given to anesthetized intact mice, and in vivo heart function assessed by pressure-volume relations<sup>23</sup> at a fixed atrial pacing rate of 600-650 min<sup>\"1</sup>. Data were measured at baseline, with ISO, re-baseline, PDE5A-inhibition, and PDE5A inhibition+ISO. The ISO-only response was highly reproducible.</p>Isolated myocyte studies</p>Excised hearts were retroperfused by buffer containing BDM (1 mg/ml) and taurine (0.628 mg/ml) for 3 min, 0.9 mg/ml collagenase (Worthington Biochemical Co., Lakewood, NJ, type 2; 299 U/mg) and 0.05 mg/ml protease (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, Missouri) for 6- 7 min. Ventricles were gently chopped, filtered (150\u03bc mesh), centrifuged (500 RPM x 1 min), and rinsed in Tyrode's solution with increasing calcium (final 1.8 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>). Cells were incubated with 5 \u03bcM Indo-1 AM (Molecular Probes), rinsed, and studied at 27\u00b0 C by field stimulation in an inverted fluorescence microscope (Diaphot 200; Nikon, Inc). \n\nSarcomere length (IonOptix, MA) and whole cell calcium transients were measured. Following baseline, cells were exposed to 10 nM ISO, then ISO+SIL, or ISO+EMD- 360527/5 at pH 7.45. SIL was diluted in 0.1% DMSO and EMD in 0.001% propanediol; control solutions contained similar vehicle concentrations.</p>Gene and Protein Expression</p>PDE5 A gene expression was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. Residual genomic DNA was removed from mRNA by treatment with DNase I, and cDNA synthesized with the Superscript First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). Relative abundance of PDE5A mRNA was determined by SYBR Green I assay (QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR, Qiagen), using the following primers: PDE5A (GenBank: NM_153422.1) upper- primer-1493 5'-TGAGCAGTTCCTGGAAGCCT-S', lower-p",

Ejection fraction was determined from cardiac end-diastolic and systolic volumes determined by Simpson's method using apical 4- and 2-chamber views. End- diastolic volume was equal to stroke volume (from Doppler) divided by ejection fraction, with end-systolic volume equal to the difference of the former and latter. Pulse- wave Doppler spectra of transmural inflow and tissue Doppler imaging of the lateral mitral annular (E') velocities were used to assess diastolic function.<sup>89</sup> The ratio of E/E' was determined as a surrogate marker of left ventricular filling pressures as previously validated<sup>90</sup>. Isovolumic relaxation time was measured by continuous wave Doppler as the time between aortic flow cessation and onset of mitral inflow.</p>Plasma Sildenafil Levels</p>Plasma sildenafil and its metabolite desmethylsildenafil were measured in each subject by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (SFBC Analytical Labs, North Wales, PA).</p>Statistical Analysis</p>Sample size estimates were set to detect a &gt;20% decline in peak left ventricular power index in response to dobutamine, with an \u03b1=0.05 and 80% power. In prior animal studies, dobutamine-stimulated power declines -50% with PDE5A inhibition, and for humans, dobutamine increases power by &gt;100% from a baseline of -300 mmHg/sec<sup>76</sup>. To detect a 20% decline in this response (60 mmHg/sec) with a standard deviation of 50 mmHg/sec (from prior data), a sample size of 15 placebo controls and 23 sildenafil treated subjects was estimated.</p>All statistical analysis was performed using Systat\u00ae software. Results are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Hemodynamic data were analyzed using a three-way repeated measures ANOVA, with the three grouping factors being: 1) presence or absence of dobutamine; 2) placebo versus sildenafil; and 3) first versus second dobutamine challenge study. The primary test was a test between group analysis of whether sildenafil (versus placebo) altered the disparity between the first and second dobutamine response, and determined by a three-way interaction term that included each grouping factor. This model \n\nalso included a term testing for an overall effect of sildenafil (versus placebo) that did not solely relate to the relative dobutamine response. Within group analysis was also performed using a 2-tailed Student's paired t-test to assess individual dobutamine responses (i.e. D<sub>1</sub>-B<sub>1</sub>; D<sub>2</sub>-B<sub>2</sub>), and a 2-way ANOVA to test whether study drug altered this response within in each group. Categorical variables were compared using the Chi-squared test.</p>The practice of the present invention employs, unless otherwise indicated, conven"
