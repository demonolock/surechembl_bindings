They are further not substituted in position 4. </p> The compounds disclosed in WO97/05113 and publication of Dolle differ by their substitution in position 4. Only arylthio and arylamino groups are considered, whereas compounds of the invention do not feature such groups in position 4. </p> The compounds disclosed in WO99/55676 differ by their substitution in position 3. Only amino or alkylamino groups have been considered. None of these chemical functions is present in the invention. </p> Compounds disclosed in International patent application WO02/24650 are of the above the compounds most closely related with those of the present invention, the compounds having a spacer between the pyridinone ring and R2, the R2 groups may be comparable at first sight. However, the specific compounds disclosed in WO02/24650 to have anti-HIV activity all feature an aryl substituent at position 4 of the pyridinone ring, unlike compounds of the present invention. No compound bearing a C<sub>7+</sub> cycloalkyl or a substituted cycloalkyl in position 4 is disclosed and/or claimed in International patent application WO02/24650. </p> The following table 8 demonstrates the interest of for instance C<sub>7+</sub> cycloalkyls or substituted cycloalkyls as evident from the EC50 value:  \nTABLE 8Effect of the R2 substituent on EC<sub>50 </sub>values<img id=\"EMI-C00044\" path=\"US20070275953A1-20071129-C00044.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/40179611/US/20071129/A1/020070/27/59/53/US20070275953A1-20071129-C00044.TIF\"/> EC<sub>50</sub>EC<sub>50</sub>R2WT (\u03bcM)Cys188RT (\u03bcM)<img id=\"EMI-C00045\" path=\"US20070275953A1-20071129-C00045.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/40179576/US/20071129/A1/020070/27/59/53/US20070275953A1-20071129-C00045.TIF\"/>1.91ND <img id=\"EMI-C00046\" path=\"US20070275953A1-20071129-C00046.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/40179642/US/20071129/A1/020070/27/59/53/US20070275953A1-20071129-C00046.TIF\"/>0.776.5 <img id=\"EMI-C00047\" path=\"US20070275953A1-20071129-C00047.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/40179641/US/20071129/A1/020070/27/59/53/US20070275953A1-20071129-C00047.TIF\"/>0.483.28(formula VII, Z25) <img id=\"EMI-C00048\" path=\"US20070275953A1-20071129-C00048.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/40179630/US/20071129/A1/020070/27/59/53/US20070275953A1-20071129-C00048.TIF\"/>0.0430.006(formula II, Z37)ND, not determined \n</p> As shown in Table 8, replacement of a cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl by a cycloheptyl leads to an increase in antiviral potency of the compounds. </p> Replacement of a cyclohexyl by a m,m-dimethyl-cyclohexyl leads to a 16-fold increase in antiviral potency. </p> Furthermore, compounds Z25 and Z37 are more active on C"
