A functional region of an exemplary V<sub>L</sub> structural domain is a region that contains CDR1, CDR2 and/or CDR3 of the V<sub>L</sub> structural domain.</p>As used herein, the \"specific binding\" or \"immunospecific binding\" with respect to an antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof is used interchangeably herein and refers to the capability of an antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof to form one or more non-covalent bonds with an alloantigen through the non-covalent interaction between antibody binding sites of the antibody and the antigen. The antigen may be an isolated antigen or present in a tumor cell.</p>The term \"Kassoc\" or \"Ka\" used herein is intended to indicate the binding rate of a specific antibody-antigen interaction, while the term \"Kdis\" or \"Kd\" is intended to indicate the dissociation rate of a specific antibody-antigen interaction. The term \"KD\" used herein is intended to represent a dissociation constant, which is derived from the ratio of Kd to Ka (i.e., Kd/Ka) and is expressed as a molar concentration (M). The KD value of an antibody may be determined using methods known in the art. The KD of an antibody may be determined by for example surface plasmon resonance (SPR, Rich and Myszka (2000) Curr. Opin.

After the incubation, 100 uL of Cell-Titer-Glo 2.0 reagent was added to the 96-well plate. It was then well mixed on a plate shaker for 2 minutes, and finally equilibrated at room temperature for 10 minutes. Readings were taken using a microplate reader.
