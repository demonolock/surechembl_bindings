    "at least one epitope or determinant with the full length protein. By \u201cepitope\u201d or \u201cdeterminant\u201d herein is meant a portion of a protein which will generate and/or bind an antibody. Thus, in most instances, antibodies made to a smaller MINK3 protein will be able to bind to the full length protein. In a preferred embodiment, the epitope is unique; that is, antibodies generated to a unique epitope show little or no cross-reactivity. The term \u201cantibody\u201d includes antibody fragments, as are known in the art, including Fab Fab<sub>2</sub>, single chain antibodies (Fv for example), chimeric antibodies, etc., either produced by the modification of whole antibodies or those synthesized de novo using recombinant DNA technologies. </p>[0125] In a preferred embodiment, the antibodies to a MINK3 protein are capable of reducing or eliminating the biological function of the MINK3 proteins described herein, as is described below. That is, the addition of anti-MINK3 protein antibodies (either polyclonal or preferably monoclonal) to MINK3 proteins (or cells containing MINK3 proteins) may reduce or eliminateone or more MINK3 bioactivities as described herein. Generally, at least a 25% decrease in activity is preferred, with at least about 50% being particularly preferred and about a 95-100% decrease being especially preferred. </p>[0126] The MINK3 antibodies of the invention specifically bind to MINK3 proteins. By \u201cspecifically bind\u201d herein is meant that the antibodies bind to the protein with a binding constant in the range of at least 10<sup>\u22124</sup>-10<sup>\u22126 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>, with a preferred range being 10<sup>\u22127</sup>-10<sup>\u22129 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>. Antibodies are further described below. </p>[0127] In the case of the nucleic acid, the overall sequence identity of the nucleic acid sequence is commensurate with amino acid sequence identity but takes into account the degeneracy in the genetic code and codon bias of different organisms. Accordingly, the nucleic acid sequence identity may be either lower or higher than that of the protein sequence. Thus the sequence identity of the nucleic acid sequence as compared to a nucleic acid sequence selected from the group of nucleic acid sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 1, 3, and 5 is preferably greater than about 80%, more preferably greater than about 85%, more preferably greater than about 90%, more preferably greater than about 95%, more preferably greater than about 98%, more preferably about 99%, more preferably 100%. </p>[0128] In a preferred embodiment, a MINK3 nucleic acid encodes a MINK3 protein. As will be appreciated by those in the art, due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, an extremely large number of nucleic acids may be made, all of which encode the MINK3 proteins of the present invention. Thus, having identified a particular amino acid sequence, those skilled in the art could make any number of different nucleic acids, by simply modifying the sequence of one or more codons in a way which does n",
    "n a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, immortalized cells. For example, if the parental cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (\u201cHAT medium\u201d), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells. </p>[0284] Preferred immortalized cell lines are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high level expression of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. More preferred immortalized cell lines are murine myeloma lines, which can be obtained, for instance, from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif. and the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies [Kozbor, J. Immunol., 133:3001 (1984); Brodeur, et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, pp. 51-63 (1987)]. </p>[0285] The culture medium in which the hybridoma cells are cultured can then be assayed for the presence of monoclonal antibodies directed against MINK3 protein. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by the hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Such techniques and assays are known in the art. The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson, et al., Anal. Biochem., 107:220 (1980). </p>[0286] After the desired hybridoma cells are identified, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods [Goding, Supra]. Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium and RPMI-1640 medium. </p>[0287] Alternatively, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites in a mammal. </p>[0288] The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones may be isolated or purified from the culture medium or ascites fluid by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein a-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography. </p>[0289] The monoclonal antibodies may also be made by recombinant DNA methods, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567. DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The hybridoma cells of the invention serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the ",

(data not shown). </p>EXAMPLE 8 [0336] 293 cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding MINK3a and Nck. </p>[0337] Following transfection, cells lysates were collected, and immunoprecipitations were done. </p>[0338] Nck associates with MINK3a in 293 cells. (data not shown) </p>EXAMPLE 9 [0339] Phoenix cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding GFP and either TNIK, TNIK kinase dead variant (TNIK kd), MINK3a or MINK3b. </p>[0340] Fluorescence microscopy was done to visualize the morphology of transfected cells. </p>[0341] MINK3a caused a morphological change in Phoenix cells. (data not shown) </p>EXAMPLE 10 [0342] MDA-MB-231 cells expressing GFP, MINK3a, MINK3b, or MINK3 antisense nucleic acid complementary to the nucleic acid sequence set forth by nucleotides 2804-3187 in SEQ ID NO: 1 were generated. </p>[0343] Light microscopy was used to visualize cell morphology of transfected cells. </p>[0344] MINK3a caused a morphological change in MDA-MB-231 cells. </p>[0345] When MINK3a expressing clone was treated with the MEK inhibitor PD98059, the cells reverted to their normal morphology, i.e. a morphology characteristic of cells not transfected with MINK3a expression vector. </p>[0346] Thus, the morphological change induced by MINK3a appears to be MEK-dependent (FIG. 14 and 15). </p>EXAMPLE 11 [0347] MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding either GFP, MINK3a, MINK3b, or empty expression vector. </p>[0348] Immunofluorescence was done on cell cultures using a fluorescently-labeled F-actin binding toxin. (data not shown) </p>EXAMPLE 12 [0349] A549 cells were transfected with expression vector encoding either GFP, MINK3a, MINK3b, or MINK3 antisense nucleic acid complementary to the nucleic acid sequence set forth by nucleotides 2804-3187 in SEQ ID NO: 1. </p>[0350] Following transfection, cells were grown in low serum (0.5% fetal bovine serum) or hi",
    "150 mM NaCl) with protease inhibitors (Boehringer Mannheim) and analyzed 24 hours after transfection. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation (14,000 RPM\u00d710 min). For immunoprecipitation studies, cell lysates (2\u00d710<sup>3 </sup>cells /lane) were rotated with 2-3 \u03bcg of desired antibodies and 20 \u03bcl 50% slurry of protein A Sepharose (Pharmacia) for 1.5 hrs. Immune complexes were precipitated and the pellets washed three times with lysis buffer. Washed precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis and Western blotting. Supersignal and Supersignal West Duro substrates (Piers) were used as detection systems for the Western blotting. </p>[0359] In vitro kinase assays\u2014For the JNK in vitro kinase assay, Myc-JNK2 was co-transfected into Phoenix-A cells with MINK3 mutants, Traf2 or MEKK as described above. 24 hours after transfection, cells were lysed with lysis buffer MINK3plemented with 20 mM \u03b2-glycerophospate, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4 </sub>and protease inhibitors. Myc-JNK2 was precipitated from clarified cell lysates with an anti-Myc mAb and the pellets were washed three times with lysis buffer and two times with kinase buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 mM \u03b2-glycerophosphate, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5 mM DTT). For the kinase reactions, immunoprecipitates were incubated with 1 \u03bcg glutathion S-transferase (GST) c-Jun (1-79) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 20 \u03bcl kinase buffer MINK3plemented with 1 \u03bcM PKI peptide (Sigma), 10 \u03bcM ATP, 5 \u03bcCi \u03b3-P<sup>32 </sup>ATP for 20 minutes at 30\u00b0 C. Kinase reactions were stopped by addition of 20 \u03bcl 2\u00d7SDS sample buffer (Norvex), heated at 95\u00b0 C. for 5 minutes and then loaded onto SDS-PAGE. ERK and p38 in vitro kinase assays were conducted in a similar fashion. For ERK kinase assays, an anti-Myc mAb was used to immunoprecipitate Myc-ERK1 and Myelin Basic Protein (MBP, Sigma) was used as an exogenous substrate. For p38 kinase assays, an anti-FLAG mAb was used to immunoprecipitate FLAG-p38 and GST-ATF2 (Santa Cruz) was used as an exogenous substrate. For in vitro kinase assays on MINK3, 3 \u03bcg wild type HA-MINK3 or 3 \u03bcg kinase mutant form of HA-MINK3 was expressed in Phoenix-A cells and immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody. Immune complexes were subjected to kinase assays as described above in the absence or presence of 0.5 \u03bcg Gelsolin as an exogenous substrate. </p>[0360] Fluorescent microscopy\u2014Phoenix-A cells seeded in 6-well plates were co-transfected with GFP and MINK3 constructs as described above. 24 hours after transfection, cells were observed using a Nikon Eclipse TE 300 fluorescent microscope. For detection of apoptosis, Hoechst 33258 was added to transfected Phoenix-A cells (final concentration 5 \u03bcg/ml) and the cells were incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0 C. before microscopic observation. </p>[0361] To determine kinase activity, a putative kinase mutant form of MINK3, designated as MINK3(KM), was constructed with a conserved lysine (Lys-54) residue in the ATP binding pocket mutated to arginine. An HA epitope tag was inserted on the N-terminal portion of MINK3(WT) and MINK3(KM). Both proteins were transiently expressed in Phoenix-A cells, and the expressed proteins were subjected to immunoprecipitation and an in vitro kinase assay. A strong phosphorylated band at 150 kD was detected in the MINK3(WT) expressed lane, but not in the MINK3(KM) expressed lane. Immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody showed equal levels of expression of both MINK3(WT) and MINK3(KM) at 150 kD. Therefore, the phosphorylated band in the in vitro kinase assay represented autophosphorylated MINK3, and the MINK3(KM) mutant was deficient in protein kinase activity. </p>[0362] Tissue distribution of MINK3\u2014The expression pattern of the MINK3 message was examined by human multi-tissue Northern blot. Since MINK3 shared high homology with NIK, a probe corresponding to nucleotides 1264-2427 of MINK3 was used to rule out any potential cross-hybridization. This region shared only 40% amino acid identity with NIK. Three major bands of sizes 6.5 kb, 7.5 kb and 9.5 kb were detected. Alternative splicing in the coding region described above is unlikely to account for the size differences among the three messages, since the largest isoform is only 273 bps bigger than the smallest isoform. Alternative splicing in the untranslated region or alternative usage of polyA sites could be possible explanations. This phenomenon is not unique to MINK3. NIK and HGK also have multiple message sizes. MINK3 is ubiquitously expressed, with higher levels of message detected in heart, brain and skeletal muscle. Interestingly, heart and skeletal muscle predominantly expressed the 6.5 kb form; placenta, kidney and pancreas predominantly expressed the 7.5 kb form; brain, lung and liver expressed all three forms at a similar level. It is currently unknown whether these messages have different functional roles. </p>[0363] Interaction of MINK3 with NCK\u2014The interaction of MINK3 with NCK was investigated "
