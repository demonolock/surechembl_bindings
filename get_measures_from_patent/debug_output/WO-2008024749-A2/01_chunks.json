    "owing stroke and explore its role in ischemic injury.</p>MATERIALS AND METHODS</p>Animals</p>[00106] Male Wistar rats, 250-350 g, were obtained from Charles River (Wilmington, MA). Animals were housed and cared for in the Animal Resource Center and allowed free access to food and water. All procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Case Western Reserve University.</p>Drug Treatment</p>[00107] Animals treated with PPAR\u03b3 agonists or antagonists were treated 24 hours before middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and again at the time of MCAO. Either pioglitazone (0.1 mg/kg; Takeda Pharmaceuticals North America, Lincolnshire, IL), \n\n rosiglitazone (0.1 mg/kg; GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals, London, England) and/or the PPAR\u03b3 antagonist, T0070907 (1.5 mg/kg; Caymen Chemical; Ann Arbor, Ml), were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Our previous experiments have shown that there is no effect of DMSO on infarction size in rats injected with 0.1 ml DMSO/25Og body weight compared with untreated rats. In addition, a similar degree of neuroprotection was found using rosiglitazone in a dilute DMSO solution. The final concentrations we injected were pioglitazone: 0.25 mg/ml, rosiglitazone: 0.25 mg/ml and T0070907: 3.75 mg/ml. These concentrations were chosen so that equal volumes of DMSO would be injected in all animals (0.1 ml per 25Og of body weight). The concentration of T0070907 is three times the concentration at which 50% inhibition of [3H] rosiglitazone binding occurs. Agents were injected intraperitoneally with the animal under anesthesia (1.5% halothane in 30% oxygen and 68.5% nitrous oxide).</p>Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion</p>[00108] Male Wistar rats, 250-35Og, were obtained from Charles River (Wilmington, MA). These rats have been extensively used in similar experiments and show good reproducibility with respect to infarct size. Animals were housed and cared for in the Animal Resource Center and allowed free access to food and water before and after surgery. Following anesthesia induction with 3% halothane, rats were ventilated with 1.5% halothane in 30% oxygen and 68.5% nitrous oxide delivered via facemask. Normothermia was maintained by a rectal telethermometer coupled to a 125 W infrared light source until animals recovered from anesthesia. The tail artery was exposed and cannulated to measure mean arterial blood pressure and to obtain blood for blood gas measurements during surgery. Animals in which normal temperature, blood pressure and gases could not be maintained were excluded from the study. MCAO was performed as previously described. Briefly, the bifurcation of the common carotid artery was exposed. The external carotid artery was isolated and a suture placed 0.5 cm from the bifurcation. Following electrocoagulation distal to the suture the external carotid was cut between the suture and the electrocoagulated segment. A suture was applied to the common carotid artery such th",
    "tion that ischemia reduces PPAR\u03b3 binding to the PPRE. Treatment of rats with PPAR\u03b3 agonists twenty- four hours before and again at the time of 2 hour MCAO resulted in a 254% (rosiglitazone 0.1 mg/kg) and 307% (pioglitazone 1.0 mg/kg) increase in LPL mRNA levels within the ischemic hemisphere (Fig HB). These data were statistically significant (p&gt;0.05). Changes in LPL expression roughly mirror the magnitude of changes in PPAR\u03b3 DNA binding seen by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Changes in LPL expression can not be explained by changes in physiologic parameters with agonist treatment since physiologic parameters including temperature, arterial blood gases, hypertension and percentage reduction in cerebral blood flow did not differ in vehicle and agonist treated rats.</p>Infarction size is increased following treatment with the PPARy antagonist, T000907</p>[00123] Although PPAR\u03b3 agonists are protective in transient ischemia models, it has been unclear if these effects are PPAR\u03b3 dependent or independent. We utilized T0070907, a PPAR\u03b3 antagonist which blocks agonist induced recruitment of co-activators to PPAR\u03b3 and promotes recruitment of co-repressor proteins thereby suppressing DNA binding to determine if PPAR\u03b3 played a role in PPAR\u03b3 agonist mediated neuroprotection. T0070907 is a selective PPAR\u03b3 antagonist and has a greater than 800 fold preference for PPAR\u03b3 over PP ARa and PPAR\u03b4. In competition with the PP ARa and PPAR\u03b4 co-ligand [3H] GW2433, T0070907 has an apparent Ki of 0.85 mM to PP ARa and 1.8 mM to PPAR\u03b4. Rats were injected with the PPAR\u03b3 agonist rosiglitazone, T0070907 and rosiglitazone dissolved in DMSO or DMSO twenty-four hours before and again at the time of two hour MCAO. Injection of agonists had no significant effect on cerebral blood flow, arterial blood pressure, arterial blood gases or temperature during the time of surgery. We have previously shown that animals injected with pioglitazone have no significant change in cerebral blood flow during two hour continuous monitoring. Animals were sacrificed twenty-four hours after MCAO and infarct \n\n volumes calculated. Rosiglitazone treated rats had significantly smaller infarct on volumes than vehicle injected rats. In contrast, infarction volumes in rats treated with both rosiglitazone and the PPAR\u03b3 antagonist were not significantly different from those seen in vehicle treated rats (Fig. 12A; student's t-test; p&lt;0.05). In addition, we treated separate animals with either vehicle or T0070907 without agonist to determine if PPAR\u03b3 was protective in the absence of exogenous ligand. These animals were treated twenty-four hours before and at the time of 90 minute MCAO. The shorter infarction time was chosen so that the infarction volume of vehicle treated animals would be small and we would be able to detect an increase in infarction size if antagonism of PPAR\u03b3 were detrimental. As expected these vehicle injected animals had infarction sizes which were smaller than that seen with ",
    "s and promotes the recruitment of nuclear receptor corepressor to PPAR\u03b3. T0070907 is highly specific for PPAR\u03b3 having a greater than 800 fold preference for PPAR\u03b3 over PP ARa and PPAR\u03b4. We found that the PPAR\u03b3 agonist, rosiglitazone reduced infarction volume by approximately 75%, when administered twenty- four hours before and at the time of 2 hour MCAO; this protection was completely lost when T0070907 was given along with rosiglitazone (Fig. 12A). These data in combination with the demonstrated activation of PPAR\u03b3 in response to TZD provide compelling evidence that the protective actions of TZDs are mediated by PPAR\u03b3.</p>[00130] We were also able to show that treatment with the antagonist increased infarction size in the absence of exogenous agonist suggesting that even the low level of PPAR\u03b3 activation that occurs during ischemia is protective. PPAR\u03b3 has a large ligand binding site which can bind a variety of structurally diverse ligands. Several fatty acids and eicosanoids bind and activate PPAR\u03b3 at micromolar concentrations and these concentrations are consistent with the levels found in serum. Conversion of 9-hydroxy-10, 12- octadecadienoic acid and 13-hyroxy-9, 11 -octadecadienoic acid by 15-lipoxygenase produces additional products which bind PPAR\u03b3 at micromolar levels. 15-deoxy-D12, 14-prostaglandin J2 is a weak PPAR\u03b3 ligand and binds at concentrations of 2-5 \u03bcM. Additionally, an oxidized alkyl phospholipids, hexadecyl azelaoyl phosphatidylcholine binds PPAR\u03b3 with a Kd of approximately 40 nM. Nitrolinoleic acid, a derivative of linolic acid, has also recently been reported to bind PPAR\u03b3 with affinities similar to rosiglitazone (Ki&gt;l 00OnM). While our data support the concept of endogenous ligands and indicate that they are protective in ischemia, it should be noted that an alternative explanation for enhanced injury by PPAR\u03b3 antagonism is that the antagonist has PPAR\u03b3 independent toxicity.</p>[00131] There is a substantial body of evidence to support a protective role for PPAR\u03b3 in neurons. Troglitazone reduces cell death in cultured cerebellar granule neurons following glutamate exposure and suppresses low-potassium-induced apoptosis in the same cells. Neuroprotection is present even when troglitazone is added two and one-half hours after the \n\n end of glutamate exposure suggesting that troglitazone interferes with downstream consequences of glutamate activation. Injection of three PPAR\u03b3 agonists, troglitazone, ibuprofen and 15-deoxy-D12, 14-prostaglandin J2 reduces cell death in rat cerebellum exposed to bacterial lipopolysaccharide and interferon-\u03b3. Pioglitazone also attenuates dopaminergic cell death in a Parkinson's disease model. Finally, PPAR\u03b3 activation in hippocampal neurons is protective against amyloid-\u03b2 induced neurodegeneration. Importantly, PPAR\u03b3 agonists demonstrate protective actions in the setting of ischemia. Treatment with a variety of PPAR\u03b3 agonists reduces infarction size following myocardial ischemia and is also beneficial in pulmonary and renal ischemia.</p>[00132] The mechanisms by which PPAR\u03b3 agonists and antagonists influence infarction size remain unclear.
