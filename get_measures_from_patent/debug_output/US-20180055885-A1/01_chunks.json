    "which may be via attenuation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling); a reduction in renal fibrosis; a reduction in renal inflammation; differential expression of a stem cell marker in the native kidney; migration of implanted cells and/or native cells to a site of renal injury, e.g., tubular injury, engraftment of implanted cells at a site of renal injury, e.g., tubular injury; stabilization of one or more indicators of kidney function (as described herein); restoration of erythroid homeostasis (as described herein); and any combination thereof.</p>As an alternative to a tissue biopsy, a regenerative outcome in the subject receiving treatment can be assessed from examination of a bodily fluid, e.g., urine. It has been discovered that microvesicles obtained from subject-derived urine sources contain certain components including, without limitation, specific proteins and miRNAs that are ultimately derived from the renal cell populations impacted by treatment with the cell populations of the present invention. These components may include factors involved in stem cell replication and differentiation, apoptosis, inflammation and immuno-modulation. A temporal analysis of microvesicle-associated miRNA/protein expression patterns allows for continuous monitoring of regenerative outcomes within the kidney of subjects receiving the cell populations, admixtures, or constructs of the present invention.</p>In another embodiment, the present invention provides methods of assessing whether a kidney disease (KD) patient is responsive to treatment with a therapeutic formulation. The method may include the step of determining or detecting the amount of vesicles or their luminal contents in a test sample obtained from a KD patient treated with the therapeutic, as compared to or relative to the amount of vesicles in a control sample, wherein a higher or lower amount of vesicles or their luminal contents in the test sample as compared to the amount of vesicles or their luminal contents in the control sample is indicative of the treated patient's responsiveness to treatment with the therapeutic.</p>These kidney-derived vesicles and/or the luminal contents of kidney derived vesicles may also be shed into the urine of a subject and may be analyzed for biomarkers indicative of regenerative outcome or treatment efficacy. The non-invasive prognostic methods may include the step of obtaining a urine sample from the subject before and/or after administration or implantation of a cell population, admixture, or construct described herein. Vesicles and other secreted products may be isolated from the urine samples using standard techniques including without limitation, centrifugation to remove unwanted debris (Zhou et al. 2008. Kidney Int. 74(5):613-621; Skog et al. U.S. Published Patent Application No. 20110053157, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).</p>Methods and Routes of Administration</p>The bioactive cell formulations of the present invention can be administered alone or in combination with other bioactive components. The formulations are suitable for injection or implantation of incorporated tissue engineering elements to the interior of solid organs to regenerate "
