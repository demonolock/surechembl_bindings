This study was designed to sequentially enroll flavivirus-na\u00efve and flavivirus-primed healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 49 years. The two sequential cohorts are each comprised of 120 human subjects (planned) randomly allocated to one of 4 groups of 30 human subjects, to receive either one of three dosages of the PIZV vaccine or saline placebo. The vaccination regimen consists of 2 doses administered 28 days apart. The data in this example only relates to the Flavivirus na\u00efve human subjects (n=124), further data with Flavivirus primed human subjects are to be expected. This example provides data from a first interim analysis following Day 57 (28 days post-dose 2) for the \u201cflavivirus-na\u00efve cohort\u201d. Data from the flavivirus-primed cohort are not part of this interim analysis, as recruitment for this group was still ongoing at the time first interim analysis.</p>In summary, human subjects were randomized into four study groups, who received two doses of either placebo (saline) or purified inactivated Zika vaccine (PIZV) with a concentration of 2 \u03bcg, 5 \u03bcg and 10 \u03bcg. The study involved intramuscular injection of the vaccine (or placebo) at day 1 and day 29, with blood samples ",
    "% in the placebo group. These AEs were mainly infections, infestations (13.7%) and nervous system disorders (3.2%: headache, migraine, dizziness). All were mild to moderate in intensity.</p>Unsolicited AEs were considered as related to the study vaccination for three human subjects (2.4%). The events reported were:\nat post dose 1, dizziness for one human subject in the 5 \u03bcg PIZV group and flushing for one human subject in the 2 \u03bcg PIZV group;at post dose 2, eye pruritus and lacrimation increased for one human subject in the 10 \u03bcg PIZV group.\n</p>These were mild to moderate in intensity, started on day 1 or 2 after vaccination, had a duration of 1 to 3 days and were all resolved.</p>One human subject discontinued with the study vaccination due to a headache after dose 1. This human subject received PIZV and experienced the headache 1 day after vaccination. The headache was resolved 36 days after its onset. No serious adverse event (SAE) was reported during the period from dose 1 up to 28 days post dose 2.</p>The few changes from the baseline observed for blood safety laboratory parameters in the 7 days following vaccination, e.g. from normal to mild or from mild to moderate AEs, occurred in comparable percentages of human subjects across the four groups. Urinalysis parameters were either normal at all time-points or the grading category was similar across groups and visits.</p>ImmunogenicityTable 19 presents the geometric antibody titers of Zika virus neutralizing antibodies (EC50) as measured by PRNT as well as seropositivity rates and seroconversion rates after each vaccine dose.</p>The PIZV vaccine was immunogenic in flavivirus-na\u00efve adults. All human subjects were seronegative at baseline. Vaccination of human subjects initially seronegative for antibodies against Zika virus elicited seropositivity in all human subjects after two doses of PIZV vaccine of any dosage: seroconversion rates ranged from 69.23% to 96.43% post-dose 1 and were 100% post-dose 2. All human subjects in the placebo group remained seronegative throughout the period considered.</p>A dose-ranging effect was observed on seropositivity rates post-dose 1 and on GMTs after each dose. After the first dose, almost all human subjects (96.4%) who had received the 10 \u03bcg PIZV dose had mounted neutralizing antibodies against the Zika virus. The second dose led to a more than 10-fold increase in GMT from dose 1, in the three PIZV groups.</p>TABLE 19Seropositivity, seroconversion rates and GMTs (Geometric mean titers)of Zika virus neutralizing antibodies (EC<sub>50</sub>) (PRNT) before and 28days after administration of each dose of PIZV (Per Protocol Set)Placebo2 \u03bcg PIZV5 \u03bcg PIZV10 \u03bcg PIZV(N = 28)(N = 26)(N = 29)(N = 30)Sero-Pre-dose0000positivity1ratePost-dose069.23 (48.21,82.14 (63.11,96.43 (81.65,(95% CI)185.67)93.94)99.91)Post-dose0100 (85.75,100 (87.66,100 (87.66,2100.00)100.00)100.00)Sero-Post-dose069.23 (48.21,82.14 (63.11,96.43 (81.65,conversion185.67)93.94)99.91)ratePost-dose0100 (85.75,100 (87.66,100 (87.66,(95% CI)2100.00)100.00)100.00)GMTsPre-dose5.005.005.005.00(95% CI)1Post-dose5.0038.06 (17.53,93.76 (44.34,291.41 (161.74,182.66)198.30)525.06)Post-dose5.001100.75 (741.07,1992.33 (1401.28,3689.89 (2676.75,21635.00)2832.70)5086.49)N = number of human subjects in the PPS with PRNT data available;Seropositivity is defined as titer \u226510; Seroconversion is defined as: seronegative human subjects at baseline (titer &lt;10) have titer \u226510 post-vaccination;Results &lt;10 are assigned a titer of 5; Titers \u226510 (limit of detection) and &lt;26 (lower limit of quantification) are assigned a value of 13.</p>The Geometric mean titers determined using PRNT, according to table 19, are shown graphically in FIG. 30.
