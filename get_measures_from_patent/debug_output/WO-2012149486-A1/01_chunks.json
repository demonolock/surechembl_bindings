Statistically significant inhibitory action for osteoclast formation (all p&lt;0.05) was seen on all AM tissues including epithelial side of iAM, stromal side of iAM, basement membrane side of dAM and stromal side of dAM. Inhibitory action of osteoclast was also preserved after gamma irradiation of all AM tissues. </p> [0047] FIGURE 5 exemplifies mRNA expression of NFATcl (measured by quantitative PCR on Day 5 as being significantly downregulated by all AM derivatives (p&lt;0.05). </p>[0048] FIGURE 7 exemplifies mRNA expression of RANK on Day 7 as being significantly downregulated for both HC-HA and stromal side of dAM. </p> [0049] FIGURE 8 exemplifies expression of P3-integrin, which is required for normal osteoclast differentiation, as being significantly downregulated by HC-HA, AML, AMP, and stromal side of dAM.

RAW264.7 cells is effectively induced into osteoclasts at Day 6 with 50 ng/ml RANKL(a). The inhibition of osteoclast formation is dose dependent on nHC-HA purified from AM. (HC-HA) concentrations inhibit osteoclast formationwhile the highest concentration of high molecular weight HA (100 \u03bcg/ml) does not inhibit the osteoclast formation (b). The color picture of TRAP colorimetric assay is provided. The lighter of the color, the more inhibition of the TRAP activity is (c). nHC- HA as low as 0.08 \u03bcg/ml significantly inhibits the osteoclast formation (d). IC50 of HC-HA on the osteoclast formation is calculated to be about 0.1 \u03bcg/ml (e). </p>[0051] FIGURE 10 exemplifies the effects of AMP (amniotic membrane powder) on </p>osteoclasto genesis. Previous results can be reliably reproduced (a). Like HC-HA, AMP dose (0 - 500 \u03bcg/ml protein) dependently inhibits the osteoclast formation (b). The color picture of TRAP colorimetric assay is provided (c and d). Osteoclast inhibition by AMPis measured by TRAP Colorimetric assay (e). IC50 of AMP on the osteoclast formation is calculated to be about 20.1 \u03bcg/ml (f). \n\n [0052] FIGURE 11 exemplifies the performance of several tissue products (AME, HC-HA, AML, AMP) in inhibiting osteoclast formation. All AM derivates significantly inhibit osteoclast formation, and AMP prepared from different donors (AMP 1-5) consistently showed inhibitory activity thatwere more potent than AML. </p> [0053] FIGURE 12 exemplifies the performance of AMP in inhibiting osteoclast formation. Powders were made from amniotic membrane (AMP), chorion (CHP), amnio-chorion (ACP), whole placenta (PLP), whole umbilical cord (UCP), and umbilical cord amniotic membane (UAMP). Like HC-HA (5 \u03bc^\u03b9\u03b7\u0390), AMP (200 \u03bc^\u03b9\u03b7\u0390), ACP (100 \u03bc^\u03b9\u03b7\u0390), PLP (100 \u03bc^\u03b9\u03b7\u0390), and WUC (100 \u03bc^\u03b9\u03b7\u0390) significantly inhibit osteoclast formation. </p> [0054] FIGURE 13 exemplifies the effects of AMP on osteogenesis. After cultivation for 7 days, the cell morphology of groups with induction (Pos Ctrl, HC-HA, and AMP) is changed: a compact layer of cells appears in the periphery in Pos Ctrl and HC-HA, but becomes clusters in AMP. Alizarin staining (ARS) shows only the periphery is stained in Pos Ctrl and HC-HA, bur both the periphery and the center are stained in AMP. </p> [0055] FIGURE 14 exemplifies the effects of AMP on bone matrix mineralization. When ARS is measured quantitatively, cell treated with AMP (125 \u03bc^\u03c0\u03cd) significantly promotes the mineralization (p = 0.0001). </p> [0056] FIGURE 15 exemplifies the effects of AMP on th",
    "derivatives (Figure 6). Expression of RANK was found to be significantly downregulated for both HC-HA and stromal side of dAM (Figure 7). Expression of P3-integrin (Figure 8), which is required for normal osteoclast differentiation, was found to be significantly downregulated by HC-HA, AML, AMP, and stromal side of dAM. Suppression of P3-integrin by AME is statistically significant on Day 5 (p=0.000001). </p>Example 2: AME. AML. and AMP Inhibit Osteoclast Formation from RANKL Stimulated RAW 264.7 Macrophage Cells </p> [00331] Murine RAW 264.7 macrophage cells were seeded at a density of 4.0 x 10<sup>3</sup> cells/96 well (30-40% confluent), cultured in a-MEM media without Phenol Red and </p>supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 \u03bcg/ml penicillin &amp; streptomycin. 24 hours after seeding, cells were treated with or without 50 ng/ml RANKL stimulation. Experimental groups were simultaneously treated with AMP, AML or AME with protein concentration of 200 \u03bcg/ml. On Day 5, the culture was terminated and analyzed by TRAP staining and TRAP Colorimetric Assay. </p> [00332] The result from TRAP staining (Figure 2) shows that osteoclasts (multi-nucleated cells) were not found on the Neg CTL while large multi-nucleated cells were found on the Pos CTL. AME inhibited osteoclast formation but did not inhibit RAW macrophage cell proliferation (Figure 2a). Osteoclast formation and RAW macrophage cell proliferation were also inhibited by AML-1 and AML-2 from 2 different donors ( Figure 11), but such inhibition was not complete because small multi-nucleated cells could be seen after TRAP staining. Osteoclast formation and RAW macrophage cell proliferation were also inhibited by AMP from 5 different donors (Figure 11) at the same protein concentration of 200 \u03bcg /ml as AML. \n\n [00333] The result from TRAP staining shows that the inhibitory action for osteoclast formation was seen on all AM derivatives. There was no significant difference between the TRAP Colorimetric Assay reading between AMP and AME (Table 1). For two donors, the TRAP ELISA reading for AMP is significantly lower than AML (Table 1) from the same donor (p=0.04 and p=0.02) at the same protein concentration 200 \u03bcg protein/ml (Figure 11).. </p>Table 1 : p-values \n<img id=\"imgf000101_0001\" path=\"imgf000101_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/211014704/WO/20121101/A1/002012/14/94/86/imgf000101_0001.tif\"/>\n </p><img id=\"imgf000101_0002\" path=\"imgf000101_0002.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/211014703/WO/20121101/A1/002012/14/94/86/imgf000101_0002.tif\"/><img id=\"imgf000101_0003\" path=\"imgf000101_0003.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/211014705/WO/20121101/A1/002012/14/94/86/imgf000101_0003.tif\"/></p> Example 3: Powder Derived from Amniotic Membrane (AMP).

    "al groups were simultaneously treated with AMP, CHP, ACP, PLP, UCP, and UCAP with protein concentration of 100 \u03bcg/ml. On Day 5, the culture was terminated and analyzed by TRAP Colorimetric Assay. \n\n [00335] Osteoclast formation was inhibited by all powder derived from amniotic membrane (AMP), chorion (CHP). amnio-chorion (ACP). placenta (PCP). whole umbilical cord (UCP). and umbilical cord AM (UCAP) (Figure 12). </p>Example 4: HC-HA Inhibits the Formation of Osteoclasts from RANKL Stimulated RAW 264.7 Macrophage Cells </p> [00336] Murine RAW 264.7 macrophage cells were seeded at a density of 4.0 x 10<sup>3</sup> cells/96 well (30-40% confluent), cultured in a-MEM media without Phenol Red and </p>supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 \u03bcg/ml penicillin &amp; streptomycin. 24 hours after seeding, cells were treated with or without 50 ng/ml RANKL stimulation. </p> [00337] Experimental groups were simultaneously treated with high molecular weight HA or HC-HA prepared at a series of HA concentrations (0., 0.008, 0.04, 0.2, 1, 5, and 25 \u03bcg/ml). On Day 5, the culture was terminated and analyzed by TRAP staining and TRAP ELISA. </p>[00338] The result from TRAP staining shows that osteoclasts (multi-nucleated cells) are not found on the negative control while large multi-nucleated cells are found on the positive control (Figure 9a). </p> [00339] Even at the highest concentration (25 \u03bcg/ml), HA does not inhibits the formation of multinucleated cells and the expression of TRAP, In contrast, the inhibition by HC-HA is detected as low as at 0.08 \u03bcg/ml, and dose-dependently increased until the multinucleated cells are completely eliminated at 25 \u03bcg/ml (Figure 9 b). </p> [00340] These observations are also confirmed by quantitatively measured TRAP activity</p>(Figure 9c and d). From the TRAP Colorimetric assay, the IC50 of HC-HA's inhibition on the osteoclast formation induced by RANKL is 0.1 \u03bcg/ml (Figure 9e). </p>Example 5: AMP Promotes the Mineralization of Osteoblasts </p> [00341] Osteoblast precursor MC3T3-E 1 cells were maintained in DMEM/10% FBS but were re-suspended into a-MEM/10%&gt; FBS and seeded at 1 xl0<sup>5</sup>/ml on 24 well plastic (2 ml per well, and designated as Day 1 from here onwards) for 2 days. </p> [00342] The culture medium was replaced with either PBS (Neg. Ctrl), osteoblast- inducing reagents (0.2 mM ascorbic acid 2-phosphate and 10 mM glycerol 2-phosphate, Pos. Ctrl), or osteoblast-inducing reagents plus 0.1 \u03bcg/ml HC-HA or 125 \u03bcg/ml AMP. The cell culture medium was changed every 3 days until on Day 18. From Day 8 onwards, the osteoblast- inducing reagents was additionally supplemented with melatonin (50 ng/ml). \n\n [00343] At Day 18, cells were assayed with alizarin red staining (ARS) to measure the mineralization of differentiated osteoblasts. Negative control was not stained by ARS but the positive control was stained in red (Figure 13). </p> [00344] Treatment with HC-HA (0.1 \u03bcg/ml) has a similar staining as that of the positive control (Figure 13). However, treatment with AMP (125 \u03bcg/ml) yields much darker staining (AMP), indicating that more minerals are generated (Figure 14). </p> [00345] The differences were also observed after ARS stained cells were removed by 4 M GnCl, showing less cells were left in AMP treated wells (Figure 14).
