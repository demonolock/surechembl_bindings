    "atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes suitable for inclusion in the compounds of the invention are hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, fluorine, and chlorine, such as, but not limited to <sup>2</sup>H, <sup>3</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>14</sup>C, <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>18</sup>O, <sup>17</sup>O, <sup>31</sup>P, <sup>32</sup>P, <sup>35</sup>S, <sup>18</sup>F, and <sup>36</sup>Cl, respectively. Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., <sup>2</sup>H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances. Compounds incorporating positron-emitting isotopes are useful in medical imaging and positron-emitting tomography (PET) studies for determining the distribution of receptors. Suitable positron-emitting isotopes that can be incorporated in compounds of formula (I) are <sup>11</sup>C, <sup>13</sup>N, <sup>15</sup>O, and <sup>18</sup>F. Isotopically-labeled compounds of formula (I) can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the accompanying Examples using appropriate isotopically-labeled reagent in place of non-isotopically-labeled reagent.</p>c.

Cells were seeded into 96-well plates at 50,000 cells/well and grown overnight in tissue culture medium (DMEM with Glutamax I (Invitrogen), containing 10% dFCS, 50 \u03bcg/mL Gentamicin, 400 \u03bcg/mL Geneticin) at 37\u00b0 C. and 7% CO<sub>2</sub>. Growth medium was replaced by medium without dFCS for overnight incubation. Cells were loaded with a fluorescent calcium-sensitive dye in the presence of 1% probenicid according to the manufacturer's protocol (Fluo4 AM, Molecular Devices). Serial compound dilutions (final concentrations 10<sup>\u221210 </sup>to 10<sup>\u22125 </sup>M) were added to the cells either alone or in the presence of serotonin (10<sup>\u22129 </sup>M) and the maximum calcium response was determined using a FLIPR instrument (Molecular Devices). Concentration-response curves were fitted using a four-parameter logis",
    "utes at 4\u00b0 C. The sucrose buffer supernatant was then centrifuged at 60,000 g for 1 hour at 4\u00b0 C. (Beckman Ultracentrifuge XL 80). The pellet was resuspended in 30 mL of ice-cold Tris buffer (20 mM TRIS (pH 7.4), 5 \u03bcg/mL Pepstatin A, 0.1 mM PMSF, 3 mM EDTA) by pipetting through a 10 mL serological pipet and centrifuged for 1 hour at 4\u00b0 C. at 60,000 g. A final resuspension was performed in a small volume of ice-cold Tris buffer (see above) by pressing through a serological pipet followed by ultrasonic treatment with a Branson Sonifier W-250 (Settings: Timer 1; Output Control 3; Duty Cycle constant; 1 cycle). Protein concentration was determined (BCA-Kit; Pierce) and aliquots stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. or in liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.</p>Receptor Binding Experiments</p>All receptor binding experiments were carried out in the corresponding assay buffer in a total volume of 200 \u03bcL in the presence of various concentrations of test compound (10<sup>\u22125 </sup>M to 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>M, tenfold serial dilution, duplicate determinations). The assays were terminated by filtration on polyethylenimine (PEI 0.1% or 0.3%) presoaked Packard Unifilter Plates (GF/C or GF/B) with a Tomtec MachIII U 96 well-plate harvester. After the plates had been dried for 2 hours at 55\u00b0 C. in a drying chamber scintillation cocktail (BetaPlate Scint; PerkinElmer) was added. Radioactivity was measured in a Microbeta Trilux two hours after the addition of the scintillation mixture.</p>5-HT<sub>6 </sub>Receptor Binding Assay</p>HEK293 cells stably expressing the h-5-HT<sub>6 </sub>receptor (NCBI Reference Sequence XM 001435) were cultured in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 25 mM HEPES, 10% fetal calf serum and 1-2 mM glutamine. The membrane preparation was performed as described above. For these membranes a K<sub>D </sub>of 1.95 nM for [<sup>3</sup>H]-LSD (Lysergic Acid Diethylamide; Amersham, TRK1038) was determined by means of saturation binding experiments. On the day of the assay, the membranes were thawed, diluted in assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1% ascorbic acid, 10 \u03bcM pargyline, pH 7.4) to a concentration of 8 \u03bcg protein/assay and homogenized by gentle vortexing. For inhibition studies, 1 nM [<sup>3</sup>H]-lysergic acid diethylamide was incubated in the presence of various concentrations of test compound in assay buffer. Non-specific binding was defined with 1 \u03bcM methiothepin. The binding reaction was carried out for 3.5 hours at room temperature. During the incubation, the plates were shaken on a plate shaker at 100 rpm and terminated by filtration on Packard Unifilter GF/C (0.1% PEI) plates, followed by 2 wash cycles with ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>.</p>Data Analysis</p>Data derived from liquid scintillation counting were analyzed by iterative non-linear regression analysis with the use of the Statistical Analysis System (SAS): a program similar to \u201cLIGAND\u201d as described by Munson and Rodbard (Anal.

IC<sub>50 </sub>and K<sub>i </sub>values were expressed as geometrical mean. For receptors with a low affinity for the test compound, where the highest tested compound concentration inhibited less than 30% of specific radioligand binding, K<sub>i</sub>-values were determined according to the equation of Cheng and Prusoff (Biochem.
