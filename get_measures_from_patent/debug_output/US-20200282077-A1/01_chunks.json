Genes were codon-optimized for improved expression from human cells and synthesized by GeneArt or GenScript and inserted into pAAV-CAG-SV40 pA vector between the CAG promoter and the SV40 polyA signal.</p>FIGS. 13A-B show the result of an ELISA to detect proteins that bind to VEGF. FIG. 13A shows VEGF-binding activity was detected in media from HEK293T cells transfected with Aflibercept (SEQ ID NO:65) or single-chain (sc) Ranibizumab (SEQ ID NOs:67, 69, and 70) expression plasmids but not from those mock-transfected or transfected with a GFP expression vector. FIG. 13B shows VEGF-binding activity was detected in media from HEK293T cells transfected with Aflibercept (SEQ ID NO:65), sc-Ranibizumab LH1 (SEQ ID NO:69), or Brolucizumab (SEQ ID NO:74) expression plasmids but not from those transfected with a GFP expression vector. The signal with Brolucizumab is very low, most likely due to poor recognition by the detection antibody. Error bars represent the standard deviation of quadruplicate transfection wells.</p>FIGS. 14A-B provide representative Western blots of media from HEK293T cells transfected with anti-VEGF constructs. FIG. 14A shows Aflibercept (SEQ ID NO:65) or sc-Ranibizumab (SEQ ID NOs:67, 69, and 70) expression plasmids. Both the clinical Eylea and the Aflibercept sample are reduced to separate halves of the dimer, of apparent molecular mass of 58 kD (including glycosylation). The clinical Lucentis is reduced into separate light and heavy chains of 24 kD, whereas the sc-Ranibizumab proteins are not separated and migrate at approximately 48 kD. A higher quantity of the LH forms of the protein are present compared to the HL form of the protein, consistent with the protein quantification obtained through ELISA. FIG. 14B shows Aflibercept (SEQ ID NO:65), sc-Ranibizumab LH1 (SEQ ID NO:69), or Brolucizumab (SEQ ID NO:74) expression plasmids. The signal with Brolucizumab is low, most likely due to poor recognition by the detection antibody. The protein migrates at the correct molecular mass of 26 kD. There was no signal in any of the mock transfection or GFP negative control sample.</p>FIGS. 15A-B show the result of a competition ELISA to detect free VEGF after incubation with media from HEK293T cells transfected with anti-VEGF constructs. FIG. 15A shows Aflibercept (SEQ ID NO:65) or sc-Ranibizumab (SEQ ID NOs:67, 69, and 70) expression plasmids. The inhibition curves of the four anti-VEGF proteins from the transfected samples were very similar to the clinical comparator proteins Eylea and Lucentis. Aflibercept and Eylea competed for VEGF more strongly than the sc-Ranibizumab variants and Lucentis. All three forms of sc-Ranibizumab were nearly identical. FIG. 15B shows Aflibercept (SEQ ID NO:65), sc-Ranibizumab LH1 (SEQ ID NO:69), or Brolucizumab (SEQ ID NO:74) expression plasmids. There was no competition activity from the GFP negative control sample. Error bars represent the standard deviation of duplicate transfection wells.</p>FIG. 16 shows the result of a cellular VEGF neutralization assay. The assay uses HEK293 cells expressing VEGF receptor/beta-galactosidase fusion proteins that produce active beta-galactosidase upon VEGF binding. The cells are incubated with mixtures of VEGF and various dilutions of media from HEK293T cells transfected with Aflibercept (SEQ ID NO:65) or sc-Ranibizumab (SEQ ID NO:69) expression plasmids. The inhibition curves of the anti-VEGF proteins from the transfected samples demonstrate that the anti-VEGF proteins neutralize VEGF activity",

The endogenous level of VEGF as indicated by the cells transduced with a GFP control vector was 4,500 to 8,300 pg/ml. Transduction with all of the anti-VEGF vectors resulted in undetectable levels of VEGF in the media. Error bars represent the standard deviation of quadruplicate transduction wells.</p>FIG. 20 shows the result of an ELISA to detect proteins that bind to VEGF in media collected from RPE cells six or ten days after transduction with the R100 capsid (having the amino acid sequence set forth as SEQ ID NO:42) expressing anti-VEGF transgenes. VEGF-binding activity was detected in media from cells transduced with Aflibercept (SEQ ID NO:65), sc-Ranibizumab (SEQ ID NOs:67 and 69), or Brolucizumab (SEQ ID NO:74) expression vectors but not from those transduced with a GFP expression vector. The signal with Brolucizumab is very low, most likely due to poor recognition by the detection antibody. Error bars represent the standard deviation of quadruplicate transduction wells.</p>FIG. 21 provides a representative Western blot of media collected from RPE cells six or ten days after transduction with the R100 capsid (having the amino acid sequence set forth as SEQ ID NO:42) expressing anti-VEGF transgenes. Both the clinical Eylea and the Aflibercept (SEQ ID NO:65) sample are reduced to separate halves of the dimer, of apparent molecular mass of 60 kD (including glycosylation), as indicated by the black arrow. There was no band of the correct mobility in the GFP negative control sample. The clinical Lucentis is reduced into separate light and heavy chains of 24 kD, whereas sc-Ranibizumab HL and LH (SEQ ID NOs:67 and 69) are not separated and migrate at apparent molecular mass of 58 kD, as indicated by the gray arrow. The signal with Brolucizumab (SEQ ID NO:74) is low, most likely due to poor recognition by the detection antibody.

All anti-VEGF constructs competed for VEGF. There was no competition activity from the GFP negative control sample. Free VEGF levels are higher in the lowest dilutions due to the endogenous VEGF produced by the RPE cells. Error bars represent the standard deviation of duplicate assay wells.</p>FIG. 23 shows the result of a cellular VEGF neutralization assay performed with media collected from RPE cells six days after transduction with the R100 capsid (having the amino acid sequence set forth as SEQ ID NO:42) expressing anti-VEGF transgenes.

In the second experiment, Aflibercept expression was about 50 ug/ml and sc-Ranibizumab LH1 expression was about 4.0 ug/ml (FIG. 13B). The signal with Brolucizumab was very low, most likely due to poor recognition by the detection antibody. No VEGF binding activity was detected in media from mock or GFP transfections.</p>Example 5To visualize the anti-VEGF proteins directly and confirm the size of the proteins, Western blot analysis of media from cells transfected with GFP, Aflibercept (SEQ ID NO:65), sc-Ranibizumab (SEQ ID NOs:67, 69, and 70), or Brolucizumab (SEQ ID NO:74) expression plasmids was performed (FIG. 14). Media from transfected HEK293T cells was run on a Bolt 4-12% Bis-Tris Plus gel (Invitrogen Cat # NW04122BOX) and the separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose with an iBlot2 device. The blot was probed with HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG Fc (Thermo Cat #31413, left panel) or goat anti-human IgG Fab (Thermo Cat #31482, right panel) using an iBind Flex device, and visualized with SuperSignal West Dura Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Cat #34076). Images were captured with an iBright FL1000 imager.</p>The Aflibercept sample appears similar to the clinical comparator protein Eylea. There was no signal in the negative control samples. The clinical comparator protein Lucentis is reduced into separate light and heavy chains of 24 kD whereas the sc-Ranibizumab proteins run at about 48 kD due to the existence of a polypeptide linker binding the light and heavy chains into a single protein. A higher quantity of the LH forms of the protein are present compared to the HL form of the protein, consistent with the protein quantification obtained through ELISA (FIG. 13A).

Aflibercept and Eylea competed for VEGF more strongly than the sc-Ranibizumab variants and Lucentis (FIG. 15A). All three forms of sc-Ranibizumab (SEQ ID NOs:67, 69, and 70) were nearly identical. In the second experiment, all anti-VEGF constructs competed for VEGF (FIG. 15B). There was no competition activity from the GFP negative control sample.</p>Example 7To confirm that the anti-VEGF proteins expressed from transfected cells block the binding of VEGF to its receptor and thus its function, equal concentrations of clinical comparator proteins and media from transfected HEK293T cells were mixed with 20 ng/ml VEGF and placed on PathHunter KDR cells (DiscoverX 93-0996Y1).
