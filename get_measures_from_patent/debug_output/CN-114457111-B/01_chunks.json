The term \"recombinant\" in the \"recombinant protein\" of the present invention does not represent a production manner thereof, and is merely used to indicate that the \"recombinant protein\" does not naturally exist. The recombinant protein of the invention may be an expressed protein, and may be an assembled protein. </p>As used herein, the term \"antibody\" generally refers to a protein comprising one or more polypeptides substantially encoded by immunoglobulin genes or fragments of immunoglobulin genes. Immunoglobulin genes can include kappa, lambda, alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon and mu constant region genes, as well as myriad immunoglobulin variable region genes. As used herein, light chains can be classified as either kappa or lambda. Heavy chains can be classified as gamma, mu, alpha, delta or epsilon, which in turn define immunoglobulin classes, respectively: igG, igM, igA, igD and IgE. Antibodies as used herein may have structural units comprising tetramers. Each tetramer may be composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one \"light\" (about 25 kD) and one \"heavy\" (about 50-70 kD) chain. The N-terminus of each member may define a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids, which is primarily responsible for antigen recognition. As used herein, the terms light chain variable region (VL) and heavy chain variable region (VH) generally refer to these regions of the light and heavy chains, respectively. Antibodies may exist as intact immunoglobulins or as a number of well-characterized fragments produced by digestion with various peptidases or de novo expression. Thus, for example, pepsin can digest antibodies below the disulfide bond in the hinge region to produce F (ab) 2 fragments (dimers of Fab, which are themselves light chains linked to VH-CH1 by disulfide bonds). The F (ab) 2 segment can be reduced under mild conditions to break disulfide bonds in the hinge region, thereby converting the (Fab) 2 segment dimer to Fab monomer. Fab monomers are essentially Fab with portions of the hinge region (see Fundamental Immunology, w.e. Paul et al, raven Press, n.y. (1993)) for a more detailed description of other antibody fragments. Although various antibody fragments are defined in terms of digestion of intact antibodies, one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that such Fab fragments may be synthesized chemically or de novo by utilizing recombinant DNA methods. Thus, as used herein, the term antibody may also include antibody fragments produced by modification of whole antibodies or de novo synthesis using recombinant DNA methods, inc"
