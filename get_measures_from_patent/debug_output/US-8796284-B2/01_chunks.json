    "n the presence of cesium carbonate in DMF at 85\u00b0 C. leads to the formation of the derivatives, such as compound of formula (XIX), which is an specific example of the compounds of formula (I) claimed by the present invention.</p>When the substituents at position 2 and 6 of the pyrimidine ring are heterocyclic rings that can not be introduced by nucleophilic substitution, the corresponding derivatives can be synthesized as described in Scheme 6.</p>Commercially available derivative (XVI) reacts with commercially available pinacol esters of heteroaryl-boronic acids in a conventional Suzuki coupling reaction or with commercially available heteroaryl-tributylstannane derivatives in a conventional Stille reaction to give a mixture of all possible substitutions that can be separated by column chromatography. For example, reaction of compound of formula (XVI) with the 2-tributylstannyl thiazole mediated by palladium catalysis yields compounds of formula (XX), (XXI) and (XXII). Those intermediates can be brominated and substitute by several pyrazo derivatives giving compounds of formula (XXIII), (XIV) and (XV), which represent specific examples of the compounds of formula (I) claimed by the present invention.</p><img id=\"EMI-C00010\" path=\"US08796284-20140805-C00010.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/272395564/US/20140805/B2/000008/79/62/84/US08796284-20140805-C00010.TIF\"/>\nPharmacological Activity\n\nAdenosine A<sub>2a </sub>Receptor Subtype Competition Radioligand Binding Assay\n</p>Human membranes from recombinant adenosine receptors were purchased from Receptor Biology, Inc. (USA)</p>Competition assays were carried out by incubation of membranes from hA<sub>1 </sub>receptors transfected to CHO cells, [<sup>3</sup>H]-DPCPX as radioligand, buffer (HEPES 20 mM (pH=7.4), 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 mM NaCl, 2 units/ml adenosine deaminase), and unlabelled ligand in a total volume of 0.2 ml for 60 min at 25\u00b0 C. R-PIA was used to determinate non-specific binding. Filter over Schleicher&amp;Schuell GF/52 filters (pre-soaked 0.5% polyethylenimine) in a Brandel cell harvester.

Unbound radioligand was removed with 3\u00d7250 \u03bcl ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH=7.4), 10 mM MgCl and 1 mM EDTA.</p>Concentration-response binding competition curves were carried out by assaying 6 different concentrations (range between 10 nm to 100 \u03bcM). The inhibition constant (K<sub>i</sub>) of each compound was calculated by the Cheng-Prusoff equation:\n\nK<sub>i</sub>=IC<sub>50</sub>/(1+[L]/K<sub>D</sub>)\n\nwhere IC<sub>50 </sub>is the concentration of compound that displaces the binding of radioligand by 50%, [L] is the free concentration of radioligand and K<sub>D </sub>is the dissociation constant of each radioligand. IC<sub>50 </sub>values were obtained by fitting the data with non-linear regression, with Prism 2.1 software (GraphPad, San Diego, Calif.).\n\nCyclic Adenosine Monophosphate Production Measurement.\n</p>These assays were performed at adenosine receptors transfected using a cAMP enzymeimmunoassay kit (Amersham Biosciences). CHO-A<sub>2A </sub>cells were seeded (10000 cells/well) in 96-well culture plates and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. in an atmosphere with 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEM F-12), containing 10% Foetal Calf Serum (FCS) and 1% L-Glutamine. Cells were washed 3\u00d7 with 200 \u03bcl assay medium (DMEM-F12 and 25 mM HEPES pH=7.4) and pre-incubated with assay medium containing 30 \u03bcM rolipram and test compounds at 37\u00b0 C. for 15 min. 1 \u03bcM NECA was incubated for 15 min at 37\u00b0 C. (total incubation time 30 min). Reaction was stopped with lysis buffer supplied in the kit and the enzymeimmunoassay was carried out for detection of intracellular cAMP at 450 nm in an Ultra Evolution detector (Tecan).
