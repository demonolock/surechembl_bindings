    "l, France) was used as per manufacturers' instructions. CHO cells, previously cryopreserved, were thawed, centrifuged for 7 mins at 1200 rpm and resuspended in serum free media, then pipetted out onto clear bottomed black tissue culture treated 384-well microtitre plates (Corning Inc, US) at 2,000 cells per well. Compounds of the invention, prepared in DMSO, and subsequently diluted 50 fold in assay buffer (1\u00d7 Hanks balanced salt solution, 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 1.7 mM isobutylmethylxanthine and 10 mM Hepes, pH7.4) are then added onto the cell containing plate where a further 2 fold dilution is performed and incubated for 15 min. Following incubation, buffer containing a 5 times final concentration of agonist is added to the plate and incubated for 30 min. Finally, d2 dye labelled cAMP and cryptate labelled anti-cAMP antibody, both made in lysis buffer, are added to the plate followed by a settling period of 1 hour. During the settling period cAMP produced by the cells competes with the d2 labelled cAMP for the anti-cAMP cryptate. The plate is read on the Pherastar (BMG, Germany). Increasing levels of endogenous cAMP produced by cells can be followed by a decrease of fluorescent signal and vice versa. Values represented by a change in arbitrary fluorescence units are converted into cAMP concentrations by use of a standard curve the reagents for which are supplied with the kit. Antagonist dose response curves (1 nM-30 \u03bcM) are constructed in the presence of 1 nM CRF. IC50 values of antagonists are calculated by fitting the percent inhibition of the effect of CRF by increasing concentrations of the antagonists. The fit is performed using the nonlinear logistic function of the Activitybase software package v 5.4.5.27 (IDBS, UK).</p>In this test, the agents of the invention show CRF, antagonistic activity with IC50 CRF, values of about 1 nM to 30 \u03bcM, preferably 1 nM to 10 \u03bcM.</p>Compounds of the invention are useful in the treatment of any state with increased endogenous level of CRF (corticotropin releasing factor) or in which the HPA (hypothalamic pituitary axis) is disregulated, or of various diseases induced or facilitated by CRF.</p>Compounds of the invention are in particular useful in the treatment or prevention of gastrointestinal disorders including irritable bowel syndrome with or without diarrhoea, inflammatory bowel diseases, post-operative ileus, reflux disease and infectious diarrhoea.</p>Compounds of the invention are also in particular useful in the treatment or prevention of major depressive disorders including bipolar depression, unipolar depression, single or recurrent major depressive episodes with or without psychotic features, catatonic features, melancholic features, atypical features or postpartum onset, the treatment of anxiety and the treatment of panic disorders. Other mood disorders encompassed within the term major depressive disorders include fatigue syndrome and dysthymic disorder with early or late onset and with or without atypical features, neurotic depression, post traumatic stress disorders, post operative stress and social phobia; dementia of the Alzheimer's type, with early or late onset, with depressed mood; vascular dementia with depressed mood; mood disorders induced by alcohol, amphetamines, cocaine, hallucinogens, inhalants, opioids, phenc",
