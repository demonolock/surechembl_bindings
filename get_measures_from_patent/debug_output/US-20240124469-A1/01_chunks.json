It is a novel ideal PIM inhibitor with high activity and low toxicity, and can be used for treating and/or preventing diseases such as a hematological tumor including acute myeloid leukemia, myelofibrosis, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and a solid tumor including gastric cancer or prostate cancer.</p><?summary-of-invention description=\"Summary of Invention\" end=\"tail\"?><?detailed-description description=\"Detailed Description\" end=\"lead\"?><heading id=\"h-0004\">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><heading id=\"h-0005\">Definitions</heading><p id=\"p-0108\" num=\"0117\">The numerical interval, as used herein, includes endpoint values and any numerical values between the endpoint values. For example, \u201c0-3\u201d may include 0, 1, 2, or 3, and \u201c1-3\u201d may include 1, 2, or 3.</p><p id=\"p-0109\" num=\"0118\">As used herein, \u201cC<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>n</sub>\u201d includes C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>3</sub>, . . . , C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>n</sub>. For example, a \u201cC<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>\u201d group refers to a moiety having 1-6 carbon atoms, that is, the group contains 1 carbon atom, 2 carbon atoms, 3 carbon atoms, 4 carbon atoms, 5 carbon atoms, or 6 carbon atoms. Thus, for example, \u201cC<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>4 </sub>alkyl\u201d refers to an alkyl group containing 1-4 carbon atoms, that is, the alkyl is selected from methyl, eth",

Calculation for Results</heading><p id=\"p-0332\" num=\"0285\">The IC<sub>50 </sub>values of the test compounds for kinase activity were obtained by adopting a fitted dose-response curve of analytic software GraphPad Prism 5. The results for the test compounds are shown in Table 1, where A+ indicates that the value is &lt;2 nM, A indicates that the value is 2-10 nM, B indicates that the value is 10-100 nM, C indicates that the value is 100-1000 nM, D indicates that the value is 1000-10000 nM, and E indicates that the value is &gt;10000 nM.</p><p id=\"p-0333\" num=\"0000\"><tables id=\"TABLE-US-00001\" num=\"00001\"><table frame=\"none\" colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\"><tgroup align=\"left\" colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\" cols=\"1\"><colspec colname=\"1\" colwidth=\"217pt\" align=\"center\"/><thead><row><entry namest=\"1\" nameend=\"1\" rowsep=\"1\">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign=\"top\"><row><entry namest=\"1\" nameend=\"1\" align=\"center\" rowsep=\"1\"/></row><row><entry>Results for PIM1/2/3 kinase activity test</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align=\"left\" colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\" cols=\"5\"><colspec colname=\"offset\" colwidth=\"14pt\" align=\"left\"/><colspec colname=\"1\" colwidth=\"42pt\" align=\"center\"/><colspec colname=\"2\" colwidth=\"63pt\" align=\"center\"/><colspec colname=\"3\" colwidth=\"35pt\" align=\"center\"/><colspec colname=\"4\" colwidth=\"63pt\" align=\"center\"/><tbody valign=\"top\"><row><entry/><entry/><entry>PIM1</entry><entry>PIM2</entry><entry>PIM3</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Compound</entry><entry>(IC50 nM)</entry><entry>(IC50 nM)</entry><entry>(IC50 nM)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest=\"offset\" nameend=\"4\" align=\"center\" rowsep=\"1\"/></row><row><entry/><entry>14</entry><entry>B</entry><entry>C</entry><entry>C</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>15</entry><entry>B</entry><entry>D</entry><entry>C</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>16</entry><entry>A</entry><entry>C</entry><entry>B</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>17</entry><entry>C</entry><entry>C</entry><entry>C</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>18</entry><entry>B</entry><entry>C</entry><entry>C</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>19</entry><entry>A</entry><entry>C</entry><entry>B</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>20</entry><entry>\u2002A+</entry><entry>C</entry><entry>B</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>21</entry><entry>C</entry><entry>D</entry><entry>D</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>22</entry><entry>B</entry><entry>D</entry><entry>D</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>23</entry><entry>C</entry><entry>E</entry><entry>D</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>24</entry><entry>C</entry><entry>D</entry><entry>C</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>25</entry><entry>C</entry><entry>E</entry><entry>D</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>26</entry><entry>B</entry><entry>D</entry><entry>C</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>27</entry><entry>B</entry><entry>C</entry><entry>C</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>28</entry><entry>\u2002A+</entry><entry>C</entry><entry>B</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>29</entry><entry>\u2002A+</entry><entry>B</entry><entry>B</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>30</entry><entry>B</entry><"
