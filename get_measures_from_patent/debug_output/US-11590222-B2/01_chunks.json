For example, the epitope may include residues from multiple regions of human C6 which, when conformationally folded, are brought together (in proximity) such that the antibody binds to one or more residues within each region.</p>The term \u201cepitope mapping\u201d refers to the process of identification of the molecular determinants for antibody-antigen recognition.</p>The term \u201cbinds to the same epitope\u201d with reference to two or more antibodies means that the antibodies compete for binding to an antigen and bind to the same, overlapping or encompassing continuous or discontinuous segments of amino acids. Those of skill in the art understand that the phrase \u201cbinds to the same epitope\u201d does not necessarily mean that the antibodies bind to exactly the same amino acids. The precise amino acids to which the antibodies bind can differ. For example, a first antibody can bind to a segment of amino acids that is completely encompassed by the segment of amino acids bound by a second antibody. In another example, a first antibody binds one or more segments of amino acids that significantly overlap the one or more segments bound by the second antibody. For the purposes herein, such antibodies are considered to \u201cbind to the same epitope\u201d.</p>As used herein, the terms \u201cspecific binding,\u201d \u201cselective binding,\u201d \u201cselectively binds,\u201d and \u201cspecifically binds,\u201d refer to antibody binding to an epitope on a predetermined antigen. Typically, the antibody binds with an equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of approximately less than 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, such as approximately less than 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>M or 10<sup>\u221210 </sup>M or even lower when determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology in a Biacore BIACORE 2000 instrument using recombinant human C6 as the analyte and the antibody as the ligand and binds to the predetermined antigen with an affinity that is at least two-fold greater than its affinity for binding to a non-specific antigen (e.g., bovine serum albumin (BSA), casein) other than the predetermined antigen or a closely-related antigen. The phrases \u201can antibody recognizing an antigen\u201d and \u201can antibody specific for an antigen\u201d are used interchangeably herein with the term \u201can antibody which binds specifically to an antigen\u201d.</p>The term \u201cK<sub>D</sub>,\u201d as used herein, is intended to refer to the dissociation equilibrium constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction. Typically, the antibodies of the invention bind to C6 with a dissociation equilibrium constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of approximately 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M or less, or 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>M or less, or 10<sup>\u221210 </sup>M or less or even lower when determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology in a Biacore 2000 instrument using recombinant human C6 as the analyte and the antibody as the ligand.</p>The term \u201ckd\u201d as used herein, is intended to refer to the off rate constant for the dissociation of an antibody from the antibody/antigen complex.</p>The term \u201cka\u201d as used herein, is intended to refer to the on rate constant for the association of an antibody with the antigen.</p>The term \u201cIC<sub>50</sub>\u201d as used herein, refers to the concentration of an antibody or an antigen-binding portion thereof, which is needed, either in an in vitro or an in vivo assay, to inhibit a given biological response by half.

    "man C6 that includes all or a portion of an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 1, 2 and 3. In another embodiment, the invention provides an antibody that binds to an epitope of human C6 that includes all or a portion of an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 1, 2 and 3, wherein the epitope is discontinuous. In yet another embodiment, the invention provides an antibody that cross-competes for binding to human C6 with an antibody comprising a heavy chain variable region shown in SEQ ID NO: 5 and a light chain variable region shown in SEQ ID NO: 10 (the VH and VL sequences of 7E5). In yet other embodiments, antibodies of the invention cross-compete for binding to C6 with other anti-C6 antibodies described herein, such as 8G09, 7E12, 7G09, 8F07, 7F06, 7F11, 7E11 or 7F02.</p>Such competing antibodies can be identified based on their ability to competitively inhibit binding to C6 of one or more of mAbs 7E5, 8G09, 7E12, 7G09, 8F07, 7F06, 7F11, 7E11, 7F02 in standard C6 binding assays. An exemplary assay for examining cross-competition for binding to C6 is an epitope sandwich ELISA, described in detail in Example 3. Furthermore, antibodies that recognize the same epitope or compete for binding can be identified using other routine techniques. Such techniques include, for example, an immunoassay, which shows the ability of one antibody to block the binding of another antibody to a target antigen, i.e., a competitive binding assay. Competitive binding is determined in an assay in which the immunoglobulin under test inhibits specific binding of a reference antibody to a common antigen, such as C6. Numerous types of competitive binding assays are known, for example: solid phase direct or indirect radioimmunoassay (RIA), solid phase direct or indirect enzyme immunoassay (EIA), sandwich competition assay (see Stahli et al., Methods in Enzymology 9:242 (1983)); solid phase direct biotin-avidin EIA (see Kirkland et al., J. Immunol. 137:3614 (1986)); solid phase direct labeled assay, solid phase direct labeled sandwich assay (see Harlow and Lane, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Press (1988)); solid phase direct radioimmunassay label (RIA) using I-125 label (see Morel et al., Mol. Immunol. 25(1):7 (1988)); solid phase direct biotin-avidin (EIA) (Cheung et al., Virology 176:546 (1990)); and direct labeled RIA. (Moldenhauer et al., Scand. J. Immunol. 32:77 (1990)). Typically, such an assay involves the use of purified antigen bound to a solid surface or cells bearing either of these, an unlabeled test immunoglobulin and a labeled reference immunoglobulin. Competitive inhibition is measured by determining the amount of label bound to the solid surface or cells in the presence of the test immunoglobulin. Usually the test immunoglobulin is present in excess. Usually, when a competing antibody is present in excess, it will inhibit specific binding of a reference antibody to a common",
    "ovides an isolated antibody that binds human C6, which comprises:\n(a) a heavy chain variable region comprising an amino acid sequence which is at least 90% (or 90-95%, 95%-98%, 98%-100%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99%) identical to an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44 and 46; and(b) a light chain variable region comprising an amino acid sequence which is at least 90% (or 90-95%, 95%-98%, 98%-100%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99%) identical to an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45 and 47.\n</p>In yet another embodiment, the isolated antibody is one wherein\n(a) the heavy chain variable region comprises an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44 and 46; and(b) the light chain variable region comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45 and 47.\n</p>Example 7 describes in detail \u201cmix and match\u201d experiments in which each of these heavy and light chain variable regions were paired with each other, in all 81 possible combinations, and the functional activity of all 81 combinations in inhibiting C6 activity was demonstrated.</p>Furthermore, In another embodiment, one or more residues of a CDR may be altered to modify binding to achieve a more favored on-rate of binding, a more favored off-rate of binding, or both, such that an idealized binding constant is achieved. Using this strategy, an antibody having ultra high binding affinity of, for example, 10<sup>10 </sup>M<sup>\u22121 </sup>or more, can be achieved. Affinity maturation techniques, well known in the art and those described herein, can be used to alter the CDR region(s) followed by screening of the resultant binding molecules for the desired change in binding. Accordingly, as CDR(s) are altered, changes in binding affinity as well as immunogenicity can be monitored and scored such that an antibody optimized for the best combined binding and low immunogenicity are achieved.</p>Thus, for variable region modification within the VH and/or VL CDR1, CDR2 and/or CDR3 regions, site-directed mutagenesis or PCR-mediated mutagenesis can be performed to introduce the mutation(s) and the effect on antibody binding, or other functional property of interest, can be evaluated in in vitro or in vivo assays as described herein and provided in the Examples. Preferably conservative modifications (as discussed herein) are introduced. The mutations can be amino acid substitutions, additions or deletions, but are preferably substitutions. Moreover, typically no more than one, two, three, four or five residues within a CDR region are altered.</p>Accordingly, in another embodiment, the instant invention provides isolated anti-C6 monoclonal antibodies, or antigen binding portions thereof, comprising: (a) a VH CDR1 region comprising an amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 6 or "
