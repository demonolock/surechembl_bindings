{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n* For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% TWEEN 20\u2122 surfactant (PBST) at 25\u00b0C at a flow rate of approximately 25 \u03bc\u0390/min.\n* The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) is calculated as the ratio kof<sub>f</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>.\n* If the on-rate exceeds 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>'</sup>V<sup>1</sup> by the surface-plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence- emission intensity (excitation = 295 nm; emission = 340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25\u00b0C of a 20 nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow-equipped spectrophotometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM- AMINCO\u2122 spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stirred cuvette.\n* In certain embodiments, the humanized antibody useful herein further comprises amino acid alterations in the IgG Fc and exhibits increased binding affinity for human FcRn over an antibody having wild-type IgG Fc, by at least 60 fold, at least 70 fold, at least 80 fold, more preferably at least 100 fold, preferably at least 125 fold, even more preferably at least 150 fold to about 170 fold.\n* Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, to 5 \u03bcg/ml (-0.2 \u03bc\u039c) before injection at a flow rate of 5 \u03bc\u0390/minute to achieve approximately ten response units (RU) of coupled protein.\n* The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight; however, the incubation may continue for a longer period (e.g., about 65 hours) to ensure that equilibrium is reached, with 100 pM or 26 pM [<sup>125</sup>I] -antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest (e.g., consistent with assessment of the anti-VEGF antibody, Fab-12, in Presta, L.G. et al., Cancer Res. 57 (1997) 4593-4599)."}
