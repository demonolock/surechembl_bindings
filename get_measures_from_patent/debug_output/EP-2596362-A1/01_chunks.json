    "luding, but not limited to, VEGF binding to one or more VEGF receptors and VEGF mediated angiogenesis and endothelial cell survival or proliferation.</p>Included as VEGF-specific antagonists useful in the methods of the invention are polypeptides that specifically bind to VEGF, polypeptides that specifically bind VEGF receptors, anti-VEGF antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof, receptor molecules and derivatives which bind specifically to VEGF thereby sequestering its binding to one or more receptors, fusions proteins (e.g., VEGF-</p>Trap (Regeneron)), and VEGFi<sub>2</sub>i-gelonin (Peregrine). VEGF-specific antagonists \n\n also include antagonist variants of VEGF polypeptides, antisense nucleobase oligomers directed to VEGF, small RNA molecules directed to VEGF, RNA aptamers, peptibodies, and ribozymes against VEGF, nucleic acids that hybridize under stringent conditions to nucleic acid sequences that encode VEGF or VEGF receptor (e.g., RNAi), immunoadhesins, anti-VEGF receptor antibodies and VEGF receptor antagonists such as small molecule inhibitors of the VEGFR tyrosine kinases. According to one preferred embodiment, the VEGF antagonist binds to VEGF and inhibits VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation in vitro. According to one preferred embodiment, the VEGF antagonist binds to VEGF or a VEGF receptor with greater affinity than a non-VEGF or non-VEGF receptor. According to one preferred embodiment, the VEG antagonist binds to VEGF or a VEGF receptor with a Kd of between luM and lpM. According to another preferred embodiment, the VEGF antagonist binds to VEGF or a VEGF receptor between 500nM and lpM. VEGF-specific antagonists also include nonpeptide small molecules that bind to VEGF and are capable of blocking, inhibiting, abrogating, reducing, or interfering with VEGF biological activities. Thus, the term \"VEGF activities\" specifically includes VEGF mediated biological activities of VEGF. In certain embodiments, the VEGF antagonist reduces or inhibits, by at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or more, the expression level or biological activity of VEGF. </p>According a preferred embodiment, the VEGF antagonist is selected from a polypeptide such as an antibody, a peptibody, an immunoadhesin, a small molecule or an aptamer. In a preferred embodiment, the antibody is an anti-VEGF antibody such as bevacizumab (AVASTIN<sup>\u00ae</sup>) or an anti-VEGF receptor antibody such as an anti-VEGFR2 or an anti-VEGFR3 antibody. Other examples of VEGF antagonists include: VEGF-Trap, Mucagen, PTK787, SU11248, AG-013736, Bay 439006 (sorafenib), ZD-6474, CP632, CP-547632, AZD-2171, CDP-171, SU-14813, CHIR-258, AEE-788, SB786034, BAY579352, CDP-791, EG-3306, GW-786034, RWJ-417975/CT6758 and KRN-633. An \"anti-VEGF antibody\" is an antibody that binds to VEGF with sufficient affinity and specificity. In certain embodiments, the antibody selected will normally have a sufficiently binding affinity for VEGF, for example, the antibody may bi",
    "erm \"FcR\" herein. </p>The term \"Fc receptor\" or \"FcR\" also includes the neonatal receptor, FcRn, which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus (Guyer, R.L. et al., J. Immunol. 117 (1976) 587-593; and Kim et al., J. Immunol. 24 (1994) 249) and regulation of homeostasis of immunoglobulins. Methods of measuring binding to FcRn are known (see, e.g., Ghetie, V. and Ward, E.S., Immunol. Today 18 (1997) 592-598; Ghetie, V. et al., Nat. Biotechnol. 15 (1997) 637-640; Hinton, P.R. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 279 (2004) 6213-6216; WO 2004/92219). Binding to human FcRn in vivo and serum half-life of human FcRn high-affinity binding polypeptides can be assayed, e.g., in transgenic mice or transfected human cell lines expressing human FcRn, or in primates to which the polypeptides with a variant Fc region are administered. WO 2000/42072 (Presta) describes antibody variants with improved or diminished binding to FcRs. See, also, for example, Shields et al., J. Biol. Chem. 9 (2001) 6591-6604. \n\n \"Binding affinity\" generally refers to the strength of the sum total of noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g., an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, \"binding affinity\" refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1 : 1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., antibody and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (Kd). Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art, including those described herein. Low-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to dissociate readily, whereas high-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain bound longer. A variety of methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art, any of which can be used for purposes of the present invention. Specific illustrative and exemplary embodiments for measuring binding affinity are described in the following. </p>In one embodiment, the \"Kd\" or \"Kd value\" according to this invention is measured by a radiolabeled antigen-binding assay (RIA) performed with the Fab version of an antibody of interest and its antigen as described by the following assay. Solution-binding affinity of Fabs for antigen is measured by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of (<sup>125</sup>I)-labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen, then capturing bound antigen with an anti-Fab antibody-coated plate (see, e.g., Chen, Y. et al., J. Mol. Biol. 293 (1999) 865-881).</p>To establish conditions for the assay, microtiter plates (DYNEX Technologies, Inc.) are coated overnight with 5 \u03bcg/ml of a capturing anti-Fab antibody (Cappel Labs) in 50 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.6), and subsequently blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature (approximately 23\u00b0C). In a non-adsorbent plate (Nunc #269620), 100 pM or 26 pM</p>[<sup>125</sup>I] -antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest (e.g., consistent with assessment of the anti-VEGF antibody, Fab-12, in Presta, L.G. et al., Cancer Res. 57 (1997) 4593-4599). The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight; however, the incubation may continue for a longer period (e.g., about 65 hours) to ensure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter, the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature (e.g., for one hour). The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1% TWEEN-20\u2122 surfactant in PBS. When the plates have dried, 150 \u03bc\u0390/well of scintillant (MICRO SCINT-20\u2122; Packard) is added, and the plates are counted on a TOPCOUNT\u2122 gamma counter (Packard) for ten minutes. Concentrations of each \n\n Fab that give less than or equal to 20% of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays. </p>According to another embodiment, the Kd or Kd value is measured by using surface-plasmon resonance assays using a BIACORE<sup>\u00ae</sup>-2000 or a BIACORE<sup>\u00ae</sup>-3000 instrument (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) at 25\u00b0C with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at -10 response units (RU). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIAcore Inc.) are activated with N-ethyl-N'- (3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, to 5 \u03bcg/ml (-0.2 \u03bc\u039c) before injection at a flow rate of 5 \u03bc\u0390/minute to achieve approximately ten response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen, 1 M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% TWEEN 20\u2122 surfactant (PBST) at 25\u00b0C at a flow rate of approximately 25 \u03bc\u0390/min. Association rates (k<sub>on</sub>) and dissociation rates (k<sub>off</sub>) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAcore<sup>\u00ae</sup> Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneously fitting the association and dissociation sensorgrams. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) is calculated as the ratio kof<sub>f</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>. See, e.g., Chen et al., J. Mol. Biol. 293 (1999) 865-881). If the on-rate exceeds 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>'</sup>V<sup>1</sup> by the surface-plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence- emission intensity (excitation = 295 nm; emission = 340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25\u00b0C of a 20 nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow-equipped spectrophotometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM- AMINCO\u2122 spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stirred cuvette. </p>An \"on-rate,\" \"rate of association,\" \"association rate,\" or \"k<sub>on</sub>\" according to this invention can also be determined as described above using a BIACORE<sup>\u00ae</sup>-2000 or a BIACORE<sup>\u00ae</sup>-3000 system (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ). </p>The term \"substantially similar\" or \"substantially the same,\" as used herein, denotes a sufficiently high degree of similarity between two numeric values (for example, one associated with an antibody of the invention and the other associated with a reference/comparator antibody), such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of little or no biological and/or \n\n statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by said values (e.g., Kd values). The difference between said two values is, for example, less than about 50%, less than about 40%, less than about 30%, less than about 20%), and/or less than about 10%&gt; as a function of the reference/comparator value. </p>The phrase \"substantially reduced,\" or \"substantially different,\" as used herein, denotes a sufficiently high degree of difference between two numeric values (generally one associated with a molecule and the other associated with a reference/comparator molecule) such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by said values (e.g., Kd values). The difference between said two values is, for example, greater than about 10%&gt;, greater than about 20%, greater than about 30%&gt;, greater than about 40%, and/or greater than about 50% as a function of the value for the reference/comparator molecule. In certain embodiments, the humanized antibody useful herein further comprises amino acid alterations in the IgG Fc and exhibits increased binding affinity for human FcRn over an antibody having wild-type IgG Fc, by at least 60 fold, at least 70 fold, at least 80 fold, more preferably at least 100 fold, preferably at least 125 fold, even more preferably at least 150 fold to about 170 fold. A \"disorder\" or \"disease\" is any condition that would benefit from treatment with a substance/molecule or method of the invention. This includes chronic and acute disorders or diseases including those pathological conditions which predispose the mammal to the disorder in question. Non-limiting examples of disorders to be treated herein include cancer (e.g., malignant and benign tumors; non-leukemias and lymphoid malignancies); neuronal, glial, astrocytal, hypothalamic and other glandular, macrophagal, epithelial, stromal and blastocoelic disorders; and inflammatory, immunologic and other angiogenesis-related disorders. </p>The terms \"cell proliferative disorder\" and \"proliferative disorder\" refer to disorders that are associated with some degree of abnormal cell proliferation.
