{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nDose ranges of peptides and antibodies and/or other molecules according to the invention to be used in the therapeutical applications as described herein before are usually designed on the basis of rising dose studies in the clinic. The doses for peptides may lie between about 0.1 and 1000 \u03bcg per kg bodyweight, preferably between 1 and 10 \u03bcg per kg bodyweight.\n\n\nNote that there are no sentences that explicitly mention a specific molecule name, ID, or other identifier along with a bioactivity metric (IC50, Ki, Kd, EC50) and its corresponding numeric value and unit. The provided text snippet appears to be more focused on describing methods, applications, and general concepts rather than specific bioactivity data."}
