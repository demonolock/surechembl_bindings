Reconstitution of the H-Y epitope with HPLC fractionated peptides extracted from HLA-B7 molecules. (A) HLA-B7 molecules were immunoaffinity purified from 2\u00d71010H-Y positive JY cells. Peptides were eluted from B7 molecules with 10% acetic acid, pH 2.2, filtered through a 10 kD cut-off filter and fractionated on a C18 reverse phase column. Buffer A was 0.1% heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA); buffer B was 0.1% HFBA in acetonitrile. The gradient consisted of 100% buffer A (0-20 min), 0 to 12% buffer B (20 to 25 min), and 12 to 50% buffer B (25 to 80 min) at a flow rate of 200 \u03bcl/min. 60 fractions of 200 \u03bcl each were collected from 20 to 80 min. (B) Fractions 28 and 29 from the separation shown in (A) were rechromatographed with the same acetonitrile gradient, but using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) instead of HFBA as the organic modifier. For both panels, 3% of each peptide fractions were preincubated with 1,000 <sup>51</sup>Cr-labeled T2-B7 cells at room temperature for 2 hours. CTLS were then added at an effector to target ratio of 10 to 1, and further incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 4 hours. Background lysis of T2-B7 by the CTL in the absence of any peptides was \u22123% in (A) and \u22124% in (B); positive control lysis of JY was 75% in (A) and 74% in (B). </p>FIG. 2. Determination of candidate H-Y peptide by mass spectrometry combined with <sup>51</sup>Cr release assay. HPLC fraction 14 from the separation shown in FIG. 1B was chromatographed with an on-line microcapillary column effluent splitter as previously described (11, 13). One-fifth of the effluent was deposited into \u03bcl of culture media in microtiter plate wells for analysis with CTLs as in FIG. 1. The remaining four-fifths of the material were directed into the electrospray ionization source, and mass spectr",
    "ial after conversion of the R residue to ornithine confirmed that its sequence was identical to that found in SMCY protein (FIG. 3). </p> In the same manner as described above for the HLA-B7 restricted T-cell clone, the peptide recognized by two HLA-A2.1 T-cell clones was identified. In short the HLA-A2.1 restricted H-Y specific T cell clone R416 recognizes HPLC fraction 34, the HLA-A2.1 restricted H-Y specific T clone 1R35 recognizes HPLC fractions 36 and 39 (FIG. 6). The amino acid sequence analyses and H-Y reconstitution assays demonstrate that both HLA-A2.1 restricted H-Y specific T cell clones recognize peptide sequence FIDSYICQV (SEQ ID NO:2) with a m/z ratio of 544 or the cystinylated form of the same peptide with a m/z ratio of 604. </p> A synthetic peptide corresponding to the 11 residue SMCY sequence (SPSVDKARAEL (SEQ ID NO:1)) was found to sensitize T2-B7 cells for recognition by the H-Y specific CTL clone. Half-maximal lysis was achieved at a peptide concentration of 10 pM (FIG. 4). The corresponding peptide derived from the sequence of the X chromosomal homolog, SMCX, has substitutions of A for S at position 3 and Q for R at position 8. Although this peptide also was able to sensitize T2-B7 cells for recognition, comparable levels of killing were only achieved by using a 10,000-fold higher peptide concentration. Binding studies showed that the concentration of the SMCY peptide that inhibited the binding of an iodinated standard peptide to purified HLA-B7 by 50% (IC50) was 34 nM, while the IC50 for the SMCX peptide was 140 nM (FIG. 5). Thus, the significant difference in the ability of the SMCY and SMCX peptides to sensitize targets for T cell recognition is almost entirely due to the fine specificity of the T cell receptor, rather than to differences in MHC binding affinities. The SMCX peptide is also present in naturally processed peptide extracts of HLA-B7, although its abundance is only 25% of that of the SMCY peptide (33). Based on all of this information, it is concluded that the peptide epitopes representing the HLA-B7 restricted H-Y antigen is derived from the protein encoded by SMCY, which is also true for the HLA-A2.1 recognized peptide, also encoded by SMCY. </p> The location of the SMCY gene and the control of its expression fit well with those expected of the H-Y antigen based on previous work. Deletion mapping in humans has placed the HY locus to a portion of interval 6 on the long arm of the human Y chromosome (18), and SMCY maps to this same interval (20). H-Y antigens are expressed ubiquitously in different tissues (5, 15), and expression of SMCY has been detected in all male tissues tested (20). One interesting issue is whether the H-Y epitope peptides presented by other MHC molecules will also be derived from SMCY. SMCY and SMCX are 85% identical at the amino acid sequence level, and the SMCX gene is expressed ubiquitously from both the active and the inactive X chromosomes in both mice and human (34, 36). Therefore, self-tolerance to SMCX wi"
