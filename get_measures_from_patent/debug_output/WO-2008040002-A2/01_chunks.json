    "2003, incorporated by reference in its entirety) which, by virtue of inhibiting the hydration of carbon dioxide in the lungs or other respiratory organs, increase the concentration of carbon dioxide, thereby reducing the capacity of hemoglobin (or other globins, like myoglobin) to bind to oxygen in the blood or hemolymph of oxygen-utilizing animals, thereby reducing the amount of oxygen that is delivered to oxygen-utilizing cells, tissues, and organs of the organism, thereby reducing the availability of oxygen to cells that use oxygen; and, (iii) molecules that bind to oxygen and sequester it from or rendering it unavailable to bind to oxygen-binding molecules, including, but not limited to oxygen chelators, antibodies, and the like.</p>In some embodiments, an oxygen antagonist is both a direct and an indirect oxygen antagonist. Examples include, but are not limited to, compounds, drugs, or agents that directly compete for oxygen binding to cytochrome c oxidase and are also capable of binding to and inhibiting the enzymatic activity of carbonic anhydrase. Thus, in some embodiments an oxygen antagonist inhibits or reduces the amount of cellular respiration occurring in the cells, for instance, by binding sites on cytochrome \n\n c oxidase that would otherwise bind to oxygen. Cytochrome c oxidase specifically binds oxygen and then converts it to water. In some embodiments, such binding to cytochrome c oxidase is preferably releasable and reversible binding (e.g., has an in vitro dissociation constant, K<sub>d</sub>, of at least 10<sup>~2</sup>, 10<sup>~3</sup>, or 10<sup>~4</sup> M, and has an in vitro dissociation constant, IQ, not greater than 10<sup>~6</sup>, 10<sup>~7</sup>, 10<sup>~8</sup>, 10<sup>~9</sup>, 10<sup>~10</sup>, or 10<sup>~\u03c0</sup> M). In some embodiments, an oxygen antagonist is evaluated by measuring ATP and/or carbon dioxide output.</p>G.
