{"raw_mentions": "Figure 2. Shows an IC50 curve for a reference compound in the AlphaScreen c-Met assay, with response on the Y axis against concentration in nM on the X axis. Data shows the compound to inhibit catalysis of active c-Met or activation of inactive c-Met, as increasing concentrations of compound show a decrease in phosphorylation of catalytically dead c-Met comprising the amino acid mutations D1204N and R1208Q. IC50 = 87.54nM, 95% CIR =1.28."}
