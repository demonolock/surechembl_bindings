    "ated in the activation loop.</p>\n  A compound may be a polypeptide, nucleic acid, carbohydrate, lipid, small molecular weight compound (for example those having a molecular weight of less than 2000 Daltons), an oligonucleotide, an oligopeptide, RNA interference (RNAi), siRNA, antisense, a recombinant protein, an antibody, or conjugates or fusion proteins thereof. For a review of RNAi see Milhavet O, Gary DS, Mattson MP. (Pharmacol Rev. 2003 Dec;55(4):629-48. Review.) and for antisense see Opalinska JB, Gewirtz AM. (Sci STKE. 2003 Oct 28;2003(206):pe47.). The invention will now be illustrated by the following non-limiting examples, which are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not to be construed as limiting upon the teachings herein, in which</p>\n  Figure 1. Shows a method of screening for both inhibitors of catalysis and compounds that prevent the activation of the autophosphorylating receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met using AlphaScreen, in which wild type activated c-Met phosphorylates a mutant form of c-Met lacking catalytic activity but retaining the ability to be phosphorylated on the activating residues. Figure 1 labels are as follows: 1 is the phosphorylation stage; 2 is the detection stage; plates are excited at 680nm and emission read at 520-620nm; D = Donor; S = Streptavidin; B = Biotin; O = Singlet oxygen; A = Protein A AlphaScreen acceptor beads; C = active cMet; K = Kinase dead cMet; Ab = anti-pYpY<sup>1234/1235</sup>c-Met antibody. \n\n Figure 2. Shows an IC50 curve for a reference compound in the AlphaScreen c-Met assay, with response on the Y axis against concentration in nM on the X axis. Data shows the compound to inhibit catalysis of active c-Met or activation of inactive c-Met, as increasing concentrations of compound show a decrease in phosphorylation of catalytically dead c-Met comprising the amino acid mutations D1204N and R1208Q. IC50 = 87.54nM, 95% CIR =1.28.</p>\n  EXAMPLE 1 : KINASE ASSAYS</p>\n  To determine inhibition of enzyme activity, kinase assays were conducted using AlphaScreen or ELISA technology.</p>\n  AlphaScreen Assay</p>\n  Kinase activity assays were performed in 384-well low- volume white plates (Greiner, 784075) with a total volume of 12 \u03bcL in each well. Each kinase reaction contained picogram- nanogram amounts of active kinase, nanogram amounts of a tagged-catalytically dead protein as substrate, suitable buffer at physiological pH; containing reducing agents, phosphatase inhibitors, detergent, cofactors and ATP.</p>\n  Various concentrations of test compounds were each added in 6% (v/v) DMSO to yield a final assay DMSO concentration of 1% (v/v). The kinase reactions were incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes and stopped by adding 5 \u03bcL containing nanogram quantities of phosphotyrosine or site-specific phospho-antibody, with nanogram quantities of appropriate AlphaScreen acceptor beads (Perkin Elmer) and nanogram quantities of appropriate donor beads (Perkin Elmer) in buffer at physiological pH 7.4 containing EDTA and BSA under low-level light conditions. Plates were sealed under low-level light conditions and incubated in the dark for 20 hours. Plates were read using an Envision (Perkin Elmer) with excitation at 680nm, emission 520-620nm. The mean data values for each test compound concentration, untreated control wells and 100% inhibition control wells were used to determine the test compounds IC50 value. IC50 value is the concentration of test compound that inhibits 50% of kinase activity.</p>\n  ELISA Assay \n\n Black high binding 384 well ELISA plates (Greiner bio-one, 781077) were coated with 80 \u03bcL per well appropriate buffer, containing microgram quantities of an antibody which binds to a tag on the substrate protein, covered with an adhesive seal and incubated at 4<sup>0</sup>C for 24h. ELISA plates were washed 3 times with 40 \u03bcL per well appropriate buffer, containing 0.05-1% detergent, 0.1% (w/v) blocking reagent. The ELISA plates were then blocked with 50 \u03bcL per well blocking reagent in appropriate buffer at room temperature for up to 4h. Kinase activity assays were performed in 384 well polypropylene plates (Matrix, #4314) with a total reaction volume of 24 \u03bcL in each well. Each kinase reaction contained picogram-nanogram quantities of active kinase, nanogram amounts of a tagged-catalytically dead protein as substrate, suitable buffer at physiological pH; containing reducing agents, phosphatase inhibitors, detergent, cofactors and ATP. Various concentrations of test compounds were each added in 6% (v/v) DMSO to yield a final assay DMSO concentration of 1% (v/v). The kinase reactions were incubated at room temperature for up to 60 minutes and stopped by addition of 24 \u03bcL stop buffer per well containing millimolar concentrations of EDTA in appropriate buffer containing detergents, reducing agent and phosphatase inhibitors. ELISA plates were washed 3 times with 40 \u03bcL per w",
    "(w/v) blocking reagent before addition of a 40 \u03bcL aliquot of the primary phosphospecif\u03cac or phosphotyrosine antibody diluted in appropriate buffer, containing 0.05-1% detergent, 0.1% (w/v) blocking reagent. ELISA plates were covered with an adhesive seal and incubated at room temperature for up to 4h. Plates were washed 3 times with 40 \u03bcL per well appropriate buffer, containing 0.05-1% detergent, 0.1% (w/v) blocking reagent and the secondary antibody (against the host that the primary was raised in) coupled to an enzyme was added in 40 \u03bcL aliquots per well, diluted in appropriate buffer, containing 0.05-1% detergent, 0.1% (w/v) blocking reagent. The ELISA plates were covered with an adhesive seal and incubated \n\n at room temperature for up to 2h. Plates were washed a further 3 times with 40\u03bcl per well appropriate buffer, containing 0.05-1% detergent, 0.1% (w/v) blocking reagent. To detect phosphorylated substrate added 40 \u03bcL chromogen or substrate, which changes colour or fluoresces when cleaved by the enzyme attached to the secondary antibody. Plates are incubated at room temperature for sufficient time for a signal to develop, then ELISA plates are read using a suitable detection system, such as a spectrophotometer or fluorescence plate reader.</p>\n  The data values for each test compound concentration, untreated control wells and 100% inhibition control wells are fitted to biologically relevant equations using non-linear regression in order to determine the test compounds IC50 value. The IC50 value is the concentration of test compound that inhibits 50% of the kinase reaction control rate.</p>\n  EXAMPLE 2: C-MET ASSAYS</p>\n  To determine inhibition of c-Met activity, assays can be conducted using AlphaScreen or ELISA technology.</p>\n  AlphaScreen Assay</p>\n  Kinase activity assays were performed in 384- well low- volume white plates (Greiner, 784075) with a total volume of 12 \u03bcL in each well. Each kinase reaction contained 40pg (10OpM) pY<sup>1234</sup>pY<sup>1235</sup>c-Met(1074-1366) kinase domain, 44ng (10OnM) cMyc-</p>\n  [D1204N,R1208Q]c-Met(1069-1366)-biotin, 25mM HEPES (pH7.4), O. lmM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, ImM DTT, 0.01% (v/v) Tween-20, 1OmM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1% BSA, 5OuM ATP.</p>\n  Various concentrations of test compounds were each added in 6% (v/v) DMSO to yield a final assay DMSO concentration of 1% (v/v). The kinase reactions were incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes and stopped by adding 5 \u03bcL containing 0.5ng anti- pYpY<sup>1234/1235</sup>c-Met rabbit polyclonal antibody (AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals) with 200ng rabbit IgG Protein A AlphaScreen acceptor beads (Perkin Elmer 6760617R) &amp; 200ng streptavidin donor beads (Perkin Elmer 6760617R) in 25mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 84.5mM EDTA, 0.3% BSA under low-level light conditions.
