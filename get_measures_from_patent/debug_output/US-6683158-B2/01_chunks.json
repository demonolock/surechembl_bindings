    "81)) and mouse spleen cells (Springer, T., et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 9:301-306 (1979)) were identified which bound to leukocyte surfaces and inhibited the attachment-related functions described above (Springer, T., et al., Fed. Proc. 44:2660-2663 (1985)). The molecules which were recognized by these antibodies comprise a set of leukocyte adhesion receptors known as the \u201cLymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1 family\u201d (or the \u201cLFA-1 family\u201d) of adhesion receptor molecules.</p>The LFA-1 family of adhesion receptor molecules contains three highly related cell surface glycoproteins. These glycoproteins have been found to mediate cell-cell interactions in inflammation. The glycoproteins have been designated \u201cLFA-1\u201d (lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1), \u201cMac-1\u201d and \u201cp150,95.\u201d Whereas LFA-1 is found on the surfaces of most leukocytes (Springer, T. A., et al., Immunol. Rev. 68:111-135 (1982)), Mac-1 and p150,95 are found primarily on macrophages, granulocytes and other large granular lymphocytes (Springer, T. A., et al., Immunol. Rev. 68:111-135 (1982); Keizer, G., et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 15:1142-1147 (1985)).</p>The LFA-1 glycoprotein family is composed of heterodimers, each containing an alpha-subunit which is non-covalently associated with a beta-subunit. The alpha-subunits of the family have been found to differ from one another and are designated CD11a, CD11b, and CD11c, respectively. The glycosylated alpha-subunits have approximate molecular weights of 180, 170, and 150 kd, respectively. In contrast, the beta-subunit of the LFA-1 family of adhesion receptors has been found to be identical, and to have a molecular weight of 95 kd (Sanchez-Madrid, F., et al., J. Exper. Med. 158:1785-1803 (1983); Keizer, G. D., et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 15:1142-1147 (1985); Springer, T., Fed. Proc. 44:2660-2663 (1985); Sanchez-Madrid, F., et al., J. Exper. Med. 158:586-602 (1983)).</p>Although the alpha-subunits of the glycoproteins do not exhibit the extensive homology shared by the beta-subunits, close analysis of the alpha-subunits of the glycoproteins has revealed that there are substantial similarities between them. Reviews of the similarities between the alpha and beta-subunits of the adhesion molecule glycoprotein family are provided by Sanchez-Madrid, F., et al. (J. Exper. Med. 158:586-602 (1983); J. Exper. Med. 158:1785-1803 (1983); Miller, L. J., et al., J. Immunol. 138:2381-2383 (1987)).</p>The importance of the LFA-1 family of receptors was initially recognized in studies which showed the ability of monoclonal anti-bodies (which were capable of binding to either the specific alpha-subunits, or the common beta-subunit) to inhibit adhesion-dependent leukocyte functions (Sanchez-Madrid, F., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 79:7489-7493 (1982); Beller, D. I., et al., J. Exper. Med. 156:1000-1009 (1982)).</p>Recently, a group of individuals has been identified who are unable to express normal amounts of any member of the Mac-1 adhesion protein family on their leukocyte cell surfaces. This disease has been termed \u201cLeukocyte Adhesion Deficiency\u201d or \u201cLAD\u201d and is characterized by chronic and recurring infections,"
