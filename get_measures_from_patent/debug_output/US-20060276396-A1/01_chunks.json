Exemplary methods are described in more detail elsewhere in this application. </p> Demonstration of Therapeutic or Prophylactic Activity </p> The compounds or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are preferably tested in vitro, and then in vivo for the desired therapeutic or prophylactic activity, prior to use in humans.

    "nclude contacting the fusion protein with a selected compound(s) suspected of having antagonist or agonist activity, and assaying the activity of the fusion protein following binding. </p> This invention is particularly useful for screening therapeutic compounds by using the albumin fusion proteins of the present invention, or binding fragments thereof, in any of a variety of drug screening techniques. The albumin fusion protein employed in such a test may be affixed to a solid support, expressed on a cell surface, free in solution, or located intracellularly. One method of drug screening utilizes eukaryotic or prokaryotic host cells which are stably transformed with recombinant nucleic acids expressing the albumin fusion protein. Drugs are screened against such transformed cells or supernatants obtained from culturing such cells, in competitive binding assays. One may measure, for example, the formulation of complexes between the agent being tested and an albumin fusion protein of the present invention. </p> Thus, the present invention provides methods of screening for drugs or any other agents which affect activities mediated by the albumin fusion proteins of the present invention. These methods comprise contacting such an agent with an albumin fusion protein of the present invention or a fragment thereof and assaying for the presence of a complex between the agent and the albumin fusion protein or a fragment thereof, by methods well known in the art. In such a competitive binding assay, the agents to screen are typically labeled. Following incubation, free agent is separated from that present in bound form, and the amount of free or uncomplexed label is a measure of the ability of a particular agent to bind to the albumin fusion protein of the present invention. </p> Another technique for drug screening provides high throughput screening for compounds having suitable binding affinity to an albumin fusion protein of the present invention, and is described in great detail in European Patent Application 84/03564, published on Sep. 13, 1984, which is incorporated herein by reference herein. Briefly stated, large numbers of different small peptide test compounds are synthesized on a solid substrate, such as plastic pins or some other surface. The peptide test compounds are reacted with an albumin fusion protein of the present invention and washed. Bound peptides are then detected by methods well known in the art. Purified albumin fusion protein may be coated directly onto plates for use in the aforementioned drug screening techniques. In addition, non-neutralizing antibodies may be used to capture the peptide and immobilize it on the solid support. </p> This invention also contemplates the use of competitive drug screening assays in which neutralizing antibodies capable of binding an albumin fusion protein of the present invention specifically compete with a test compound for binding to the albumin fusion protein or fragments thereof.

On average, an EC50 of greater than 5 fold of that of rhEPO was established (see FIG. 7). </p> The Activity of Construct 1997 can be Assayed Using an In Vivo Harlan Mouse Model for Measuring Hematocrit. </p> Methods </p> The in vivo Harlan mouse model was used to assay for hematocrit levels upon subcutaneous administration of either control rhEPO or EPO albumin fusion protein encoded by construct 1981 at various doses on days 0, 2, 4, and 6. The assay was carried out as previously described in Example 8 under subsection heading \u201cThe activity of construct 1966 can be assayed using an in vivo Harlan mouse model for measuring hematocrit\u201d. Hematocrit was determined on days 0, 8, and 14. </p> Results </p> There was a significant and similar increase in hematocrit (see FIG. 8) from day 0 to day 8 for animals treated with either rhEPO or the EPO albumin fusion encoded by construct 1997. However, as was the case for the EPO albumin fusion protein encoded by construct 1966 but to a lesser extent, subcutaneous administration of 3 doses/week of 52 \u03bcg/kg of EPO albumin fusion encoded by construct 1997 caused close to 30% change in hematocrit from day 0 to day 8 and subdued to \u02dc15% on day 14 (see FIG. 6) as opposed to a decline from close to 30% to &lt;10% for a triple dose of 12 \u03bcg/kg subcutaneous administration of rhEPO per week. </p> DBA mice injected intravenously with a 150 \u03bcg/kg dose of EPO-HSA cleared this EPO albumin fusion 7 times more slowly than rhEPO. </p>Example 11 Construct ID 2294, EPO-HS",
    "way that culminates in the activation of Interferon, \u201cIFN\u201d, responsive genes through the Interferon Sequence Responsive Element, \u201cISRE\u201d. A convenient assay for type I IFN activity is a promoter-reporter based assay system that contains multiple copies of the ISRE element fused to a downstream reporter gene. A stable HEK293 cell-line can be generated and contains a stably integrated copy of an ISRE-SEAP reporter gene that is extremely sensitive to type I IFNs and displays linearity over 5 logs of concentration. </p> Method of Screening of IFNb-HSA NS0 Stable Clones. </p> Construct 2053 was electroporated into NS0 cells as described in Example 6. The NS0 cells transfected with construct ID # 2053 were screened for activity by testing conditioned growth media in the ISRE-SEAP assay. The ISRE-SEAP/293F reporter cells were plated at 3\u00d710<sup>4 </sup>cell/well in 96-well, poly-D-lysine coated, plates, one day prior to treatment. Reporter cells were treated with various dilutions (including but not limited to 1:500 and 1:5000) of conditioned supernatant or purified preparations of IFNb albumin fusion protein encoded by construct ID 2053 or rhIFNb as a control. The reporter cells were then incubated for 24 hours prior to removing 40 \u25a1L for use in the SEAP Reporter Gene Chemiluminescent Assay (Roche catalog # 1779842). Recombinant human Interferon beta, \u201crhIFNb\u201d (Biogen), was used as a positive control. </p> Result </p> The purified preparation of NS0 expressed IFNb-HSA had a greater EC50 of 9.3\u00d710<sup>\u22129 </sup>g/mL than rhIFNb (Biogen) which had an EC50 of 1.8\u00d710<sup>\u221210 </sup>g/mL (see FIG. 13). </p> In Vivo Induction of OAS by an Interferon. </p> Method </p> The OAS enzyme, 2\u2032-5\u2032-OligoAdenylate Synthetase, is activated at the transcriptional level by interferon in response to antiviral infection. The effect of interferon constructs can be measured by obtaining blood samples from treated monkeys and analyzing these samples for transcriptional activation of two OAS mRNA, p41 and p69. A volume of 0.5 mL of whole blood can be obtained from 4 animals per group at 7 different time points, day 0, day 1, day 2, day 4, day 8, day 10, and day 14 per animal. The various groups may include injection of vehicle control, intravenous and/or subcutaneous injection of either 30 \u25a1g/kg and/or 300 \u25a1g/kg IFN albumin fusion protein on day 1, and subcutaneous injection of 40 \u25a1g/kg of Interferon alpha (Schering-Plough) as a positive control on days 1, 3, and 5. The levels of the p41 and the p69 mRNA transcripts can be determined by real-time quantitative PCR (Taqman) using probes specific for p41-OAS and p69-OAS. OAS mRNA levels can be quantitated relative to 18S ribosomal RNA endogenous control. </p> In Vivo Induction of OAS by Interferon Beta Albumin Fusion Encoded by Construct ID 2053. </p> Method </p> The activity of the HSA-IFNb fusion protein encoded by construct 2053 can be assayed in the in vivo OAS assay as previously described above under subsection heading, \u201cIn vivo induction of OAS by an Interferon\u201d. </p>Example 26 Indications fo",

This plasmid comprised the entire 2 \u03bcm plasmid to provide replication functions and the LEU2 gene for selection of transformants. </p> pHGH12 was introduced into S. cerevisiae D88 by transformation and individual transformants were grown for 3 days at 30\u00b0 C. in 10 mL YEPD (1% w/v yeast extract, 2% w/v, peptone, 2% w/v, dextrose). </p> After centrifugation of the cells, the supernatants were examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and were found to contain protein which was of the expected size and which was recognized by anti-hGH antiserum (Sigma, Poole, UK) on Western blots. </p> Cloning and Expression of an HSA-hGH Fusion Protein. </p> In order to fuse the HSA cDNA to the 5\u2032 end of the hGH cDNA, the pHSA1 HindIII-Bsu361 fragment (containing most of the HSA cDNA) was joined to the pHGH1 EcoRI-HindIII fragment (containing most of the hGH cDNA) via two oligonucleotides, HGH7 and HGH8 \nHGH7:5\u2032-TTAGGCTTATTCCCAAC 3\u2032(SEQ ID NO:1025) HGH8:5\u2032-AATTGTTGGGAATAAGCC 3\u2032(SEQ ID NO:1026)\n</p> The HindIII fragment so formed was cloned into pHSA2 digested with HindIII to make pHGH10, and the NotI expression cassette of this plasmid was cloned into NotI-digested pSAC35 to make pHGH16. </p> pHGH16 was used to transform S. cerevisiae D88 and supernatants of cultures were analyzed as described above. A predominant band was observed that had a molecular weight of approximately 88 kD, corresponding to the combined masses of HSA and hGH. Western blotting using anti-HSA and anti-hGH antisera (Sigma) confirmed the presence of the two constituent parts of the albumin fusion protein. </p> The albumin fusion protein was purified from culture supernatant by cation exchange chromatography, followed by anion exchange and gel permeation chromatography. Analysis of the N-terminus of the protein by amino acid sequencing confirmed the presence of the expected albumin sequence. </p> An in vitro growth hormone activity assay (Ealey et al., Growth Regulation 5:36 (1995)) indicated that the albumin fusion protein possessed full hGH activity. In a hypophysectomised rat weight gain model, performed essentially as described in the European Pharmacopoeia (1987, monograph 556), the fusion molecule was more potent than hGH when the same number of units of activity (based on the above in vitro assay) were administered daily. Further experiments in which the albumin fusion protein was administered once every four days showed a similar overall growth response to a daily administration of hGH. Pharmacokinetic experiments in which <sup>125</sup>I-labeled protein was administered to rats indicated an approximately ten-fold increase in circulatory half-life for the albumin fusion protein compared to hGH. </p> A similar plasmid was constructed in which DNA encoding the S. cerevisiae invertase (SUC2) leader sequence replaced the sequence for the hybrid leader, such that the encoded l",
    "nto S. cerevisiae DBI, this plasmid directed the expression and secretion of the albumin fusion protein at a level similar to that obtained with pHGH16. Analysis of the N-terminus of the albumin fusion protein indicated precise and efficient cleavage of the leader sequence from the mature protein. </p> Cloning and Expression of an hGH-HSA Fusion Protein. </p> In order to fuse the hGH cDNA to the 5\u2032 end of the HSA cDNA, the HSA cDNA was first altered by site-directed mutagenesis to introduce an EcoNI site near the 5\u2032 end of the coding region. This was done by the method of Kunkel et al. (Methods in Enzymol. 154:367 (1987)) using single-stranded DNA template prepared from pHSAI and a synthetic oligonucleotide, LEU4:  \nLEU4:5\u2032-GAGATGCACACCTGAGTGAGG-3\u2032(SEQ ID NO:1028)\n</p> Site-directed mutagenesis using this oligonucleotide changed the coding sequence of the HSA cDNA from Lys4 to Leu4 (K4L). However, this change was repaired when the hGH cDNA was subsequently joined at the 5\u2032 end by linking the pHGH2 NotI-BamHI fragment to the EcoNI-NotI fragment of the mutated pHSAI, via the two oligonucleotides HGH5 and HGH6:  \n(SEQ ID NO:1029)HGH5:5\u2032-GATCCTGTGGCTTCGATGCACACAAGA-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO:1030)HGH6:5\u2032-CTCTTGTGTGCATCGAAGCCACAG-3\u2032\n</p> The NotI fragment so formed was cloned into NotI-digested pSAC35 to make pHGH14. pHGH14 was used to transform S. cerevisiae D88 and supernatants of culture were analyzed as above. A predominant band was observed that had a molecular weight of approximately 88 kD, corresponding to the combined masses of hGH and HSA. Western blotting using anti-HSA and anti-hGH antisera confirmed the presence of the two constituent parts of the albumin fusion protein. </p> The albumin fusion protein was purified from culture supernatant by cation exchange chromatography, followed by anion exchange and gel permeation chromatography. Analysis of the N-terminus of the protein by amino acid sequencing confirmed the presence of the expected hGH sequence. </p> In vitro studies showed that the albumin fusion protein retained hGH activity, but was significantly less potent than an albumin fusion protein comprising full length HSA (1-585) as the N-terminal portion and hGH as the C-terminal portion, as described above. </p> Construction of Plasmids for the Expression of hGH Fusions to Domains of HSA. </p> Fusion polypeptides were made in which the hGH molecule was fused to the first two domains of HSA (residues 1 to 387). Fusion to the N terminus of hGH was achieved by joining the pHSA1 HindIII-SapI fragment, which contained most of the coding sequence for domains 1 and 2 of HSA, to the pHGHI EcoRI-HindIII fragment, via the oligonucleotides HGH 11 and HGH 12:  \n(SEQ ID NO:1031)HGH11:5\u2032-TGTGGAAGAGCCTCAGAATTTATTCCCAAC-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO:1032)HGH12:5\u2032-AATTGTTGGGAATAAATTCTGAGGCTCTTCC-3\u2032\n</p> The HindIII fragment so formed was cloned into HindIII-digested pHSA2 to make pHGH37 and the NotI expression cassette of this plasmid was cloned into NotI-digested pSAC35. </p> Th",
    " and tissue/cell extracts for activating ligands. </p>Example 94 Microphysiometric Assays  Activation of a wide variety of secondary messenger systems results in extrusion of small amounts of acid from a cell. The acid formed is largely as a result of the increased metabolic activity required to fuel the intracellular signaling process. The pH changes in the media surrounding the cell are very small but are detectable by the CYTOSENSOR microphysiometer (Molecular Devices Ltd., Menlo Park, Calif.). The CYTOSENSOR is thus capable of detecting the ability of an albumin fusion protein of the invention to activate secondary messengers that are coupled to an energy utilizing intracellular signaling pathway. </p>Example 95 Extract/Cell Supernatant Screening  A large number of mammalian receptors exist for which there remains, as yet, no cognate activating ligand (agonist). Thus, active ligands for these receptors may not be included within the ligands banks as identified to date. Accordingly, the albumin fusion proteins of the invention can also be functionally screened (using calcium, cAMP, microphysiometer, oocyte electrophysiology, etc., functional screens) against tissue extracts to identify natural ligands for the Therapeutic protein portion and/or albumin protein portion of an albumin fusion protein of the invention. Extracts that produce positive functional responses can be sequentially subfractionated until an activating ligand is isolated and identified. </p>Example 96 ATP-Binding Assay  The following assay may be used to assess ATP-binding activity of fusion proteins of the invention. </p> ATP-binding activity of an albumin fusion protein of the invention may be detected using the ATP-binding assay described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,858,719, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Briefly, ATP-binding to an albumin fusion protein of the invention is measured via photoaffinity labeling with 8-azido-ATP in a competition assay. Reaction mixtures containing 1 mg/ml of ABC transport protein are incubated with varying concentrations of ATP, or the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog adenyl-5\u2032-imidodiphosphate for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. A mixture of 8-azido-ATP (Sigma Chem. Corp., St. Louis, Mo.) plus 8-azido-ATP (<sup>32</sup>P-ATP) (5 mCi/\u03bcmol, ICN, Irvine Calif.) is added to a final concentration of 100 \u03bcM and 0.5 ml aliquots are placed in the wells of a porcelain spot plate on ice. The plate is irradiated using a short wave 254 nm UV lamp at a distance of 2.5 cm from the plate for two one-minute intervals with a one-minute cooling interval in between. The reaction is stopped by addition of dithiothreitol to a final concentration of 2 mM. The incubations are subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, dried, and autoradiographed. Protein bands corresponding to the albumin fusion proteins of the invention are excised, and the radioactivity quantified. A decrease in radioactivity with increasing ATP or adenly-5\u2032-imidodiphosphate provides a measure of ATP affinity to the fusion protein. </p>Example 97 Phosphorylation Assay  In order to assay for phosphorylation activity of an albumin fusion protein of the invention, a phosphorylation assay as described in U.S. Pat.
