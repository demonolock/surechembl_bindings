Exemplary immune checkpoint inhibitors include inhibitors against immune checkpoint molecules such as CD27, CD28, CD40, CD122, CD96, CD73, CD47, OX40, GITR, CSF1R, JAK, PI3K delta, PI3K gamma, TAM, arginase, CD137 (also known as 4-1BB), ICOS, A2AR, B7-H3, B7-H4, BTLA, CTLA-4, LAG3 (e.g., INCAGN2385), TIM3 (e.g., INCB2390), VISTA, PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2. In some embodiments, the immune checkpoint molecule is a stimulatory checkpoint molecule selected from CD27, CD28, CD40, ICOS, OX40 (e.g., INCAGN1949), GITR (e.g., INCAGN1876) and CD137. In some embodiments, the immune checkpoint molecule is an inhibitory checkpoint molecule selected from A2AR, B7-H3, B7-H4, BTLA, CTLA-4, IDO, KIR, LAG3, PD-1, TIM3, and VISTA. In some embodiments, the compounds provided herein can be used in combination with one or more agents selected from KIR inhibitors, TIGIT inhibitors, LAIR1 inhibitors, CD160 inhibitors, 2B4 inhibitors and TGFR beta inhibitors.</p>In some embodiments, the inhibitor of an immune checkpoint molecule is a small molecule PD-L1 inhibitor. In some embodiments, the small molecule PD-L1 inhibitor has an IC50 less than 1 \u03bcM, less than 100 nM, less than 10 nM or less than 1 nM in a PD-L1 assay described in US Patent Publication Nos. US 20170107216, US 20170145025, US 20170174671, US 20170174679, US 20170320875, US 20170342060, US 20170362253, and US 20180016260, each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.</p>In some embodiments, the inhibitor of an immune checkpoint molecule is an inhibitor of PD-1, e.g., an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody. In some embodiments, the anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody is MGA012 (retifanlimab), nivolumab, pembrolizumab (also known as MK-3475), pidilizumab, SHR-1210, PDR001, ipilumimab or AMP-224. In some embodiments, the anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody is nivolumab or pembrolizumab. In some embodiments, the anti-PD1 antibody is pembrolizumab. In some embodiments, the anti-PD1 antibody is nivolumab. In some embodiments, the anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody is MGA012 (retifanlimab). In some embodiments, the anti-PD1 antibody is SHR-1210. Other anti-cancer agent(s) include antibody therapeutics such as 4-1BB (e.g. urelumab, utomilumab.</p>In some embodiments, the compounds of the disclosure can be used in combination with INCB086550.</p>In some embodiments, the inhibitor of an immune checkpoint molecule is an inhibitor of PD-L1, e.g., an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody.
