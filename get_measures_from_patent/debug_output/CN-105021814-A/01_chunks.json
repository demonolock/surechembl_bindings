    "prise the activation of various T cell strain and the activation of propagation and NK cell or the member of other innate immune system.This type of many-sided antitumor response is more effective for the irradiation of the tumour just generated and obvious transfer.</p>Data shows the biologically active bifunctioanl molecule that possibility construction one contains TCR and cell factor.This fusion has the ability of the combination being bonded to tumour, medium target cell and function cells, and has the characteristic of rational pharmacokinetics.Except p53, other gene outcome through negative regulator and by the tumour of offering in MHC background or on the cell of virus infections, can as the target cell for this TCR being main immunotherapy.Moreover other immune modulatory molecules is GM-CSF, IFN \u03b3 or IFN-\u03b1 such as, this TCR can be connected to activate other function cells that is anticancer or antiviral response.These novel TCR fusions will form the newtype of the immunotherapy of a kind of Therapeutic cancer and virus infections.</p>Term \" specific binding \" or relational language mean the molecule in conjunction with other molecule disclosed herein, thus form a specific binding pair.But, this molecule cannot identification or be bonded to other molecule measured by following method, such as Western ELISA, RIA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay method (mobility shift assay), immunoassay, competitive type analytic approach, saturation analysis or other protein binding assay known in the art.Generally refer to, the people supra such as Ausubel; Between Harlow and Lane in, Antibodies:4Laboratory Manual (1988) and detection molecules thereof specific binding method in the list of references quoted of embodiment.</p>Term \" completely solvable \" or relational language mean the centrifugal force of TCR-from aqueous buffer solution of not readily sedimentation under low G, such as cellular matrix.Moreover, if this fusion still exists in the aqueous solution being greater than about 5 to 37 DEG C, and low or to be under existing without anionic property or non-ionic detergent or close to the situation of neutral pH, this sc-TCR fusion is solubility.In tiiese cases, soluble protein often will have low sedimentation value, such as, be less than about 10 to 50 Svedbergs (svedberg unit).The aqueous solution quoted herein has buffering compound usually to set up pH, typical pH scope about 5 to 9, and ionic strength range is about between 2mM and 500mM.Sometimes protein inhibitor or mild non-ionic detergent is added, if when needing bovine serum albumin(BSA) (BSA) to reach low mg/ml, also carrier protein can be added.Exemplary aqueous buffers comprises standard phosphate buffered saline aqueous solution, Tris buffered saline solution or other known damping fluid and cell media formulations.</p>Following non-limiting embodiment is for the present invention is described.</p>The generation of embodiment 1:TCR fusion structure</p>Manufacture fusion,",
