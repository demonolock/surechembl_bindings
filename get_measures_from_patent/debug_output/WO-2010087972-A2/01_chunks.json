    " as described in the text. Approximately 5000 RU of goat anti-mouse IgG, (Fc\u03b3), fragment specific polyclonal antibody (Pierce Biotechnology Inc, Rockford, IL) diluted in 10 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.5) was directly immobilized across a CM5 research grade biosensor chip using a standard amine coupling kit according to manufacturer's instructions and procedures at 25 \u03bcg/ml. Unreacted moieties on the biosensor surface were blocked with ethanolamine. Modified carboxymethyl dextran surface in flowcell 2 and 4 was used as a reaction surface. Unmodified carboxymethyl dextran without goat anti-mouse IgG in flow cell 1 and 3 was used as the reference surface. For kinetic analysis, rate equations derived from the 1 : 1 Langmuir binding model were fitted simultaneously to association and dissociation phases of all eight injections (using global fit analysis) with the use of Biaevaluation 4.0.1 software. Purified antibodies were diluted in HEPES-buffered saline for capture across goat anti-mouse IgG specific reaction surfaces. Mouse antibodies to be captured as a ligand (25 \u03bcg/ml) were injected over reaction matrices at a flow rate of 5 \u03bcl/min. The association and dissociation rate constants, Ic<sub>0n</sub> (unit M<sup>-1</sup>S<sup>\"1</sup>) and k<sub>off</sub> (unit s<sup>\"1</sup>) were determined under a continuous flow rate of 25 \u03bcl/min. Rate constants were derived by making kinetic binding measurements at ten different antigen concentrations ranging from 10 - 200 nM. The equilibrium dissociation constant (unit M) of the reaction between mouse antibodies and recombinant purified human IL l\u03b1 or recombinant purified human IL l\u03b1 was then calculated from the kinetic rate constants by the following formula: K<sub>D</sub> = IWk<sub>0n</sub>. Binding is recorded as a function of time and kinetic rate constants are calculated. In this assay, on-rates as fast as 10<sup>6</sup> M <sup>1</sup>S<sup>'1</sup> and off-rates as slow as 10<sup>\"6</sup> s<sup>\"1</sup> can be measured.</p>Example 1.1. C: Functional Activity of anti human DL l\u03b1 antibodies To examine the functional activity of the anti-human IL l\u03b1 antibodies of the invention, the antibodies were used in the following assays that measure the ability of an antibody to inhibit IL l\u03b1 activity.</p>Example l.l.C 1 MRC-5 bioassav The MRC-5 cell line is a human lung fibroblast cell line that produces IL-8 in response to human IL-I .alpha in a dose-dependent manner. MRC-5 cells were originally obtained from ATCC and subcultured in 10% FBS complete MEM and grown at 37 C in a 5% CO2 incubator. To determine an antibody's neutralizing potency against IL-I .alpha, antibodies (50 ul) was added to a 96 well plate (1E-7 to IE-15 M final concentration) and pre-incubated with 50 ul of IL- 1.alpha (50 pg/mL final concentration) for 1 hr at 37 C, 5% CO2. MRC-5 cells at a concentration of lE5/ml were then added (100 ul) to all wells and the plates were incubated overnight at 37 C \n\n in a 5% CO2 incubator. Antibody potency was det"
