Typically, HLA-G forms an MHC class I complex together with \u03b22 microglobulin (b2M or \u03b22m). In one embodiment HLA-G refers to the MHC class I complex of HLA-G and \u03b22 microglobulin.</p>As used herein, an antibody \u201cbinding to human HLA-G\u201d, \u201cspecifically binding to human HLA-G\u201d, \u201cthat binds to human HLA-G\u201d or \u201canti-HLA-G antibody\u201d refers to an antibody specifically binding to the human HLA-G antigen or its extracellular domain (ECD) with a binding affinity of a K<sub>D</sub>-value of 5.0\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>mol/l or lower, in one embodiment of a K<sub>D</sub>-value of 1.0\u00d710<sup>\u22129 </sup>mol/1 or lower, in one embodiment of a K<sub>D</sub>-value of 5.0\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>mol/1 to 1.0\u00d710<sup>\u221213 </sup>mol/l. In one embodiment the antibody binds to HLA-G \u00df2M MHC I complex comprising SEQ ID NO: 43).</p>The binding affinity is determined with a standard binding assay, such as surface plasmon resonance technique (BIAcore\u00ae, GE-Healthcare Uppsala, Sweden) e.g., using constructs comprising HLA-G extracellular domain (e.g., in its natural occurring three-dimensional structure). In one embodiment binding affinity is determined with a standard binding assay using exemplary soluble HLA-G comprising MHC class I complex comprising SEQ ID NO: 43.</p>HLA-G has the regular MHC I fold and consists of two chains: Chain 1 consists of three domains: alpha 1, alpha 2 and alpha 3. The alpha 1 and alpha 2 domains form a peptide binding groove flanked by two alpha helices. Small peptides (approximately 9mers) can bind to this groove akin to other MHCI proteins. Chain 2 is beta 2 microglobulin which is shared with various other MHCI proteins.</p>HLA-G can form functionally active complex oligomeric structures (Kuroki, K et al. Eur J Immunol. 37 (2007) 1727-1729). Disulfide-linked dimers are formed between Cys 42 of two HLA-G molecules. (Shiroishi M et al., J Biol Chem 281 (2006) 10439-10447. Trimers and Tetrameric complexes have also been described e.g., in Kuroki, K et al. Eur J Immunol. 37 (2007) 1727-1729, Allan D. S., et al. J Immunol Methods. 268 (2002) 43-50 and T Gonen-Gross et al., J Immunol 171 (2003)1343-1351). HLA-G has several free cysteine residues, unlike most of the other MHC class I molecules. Boyson et al., Proc Nat Acad Sci USA, 99: 16180 (2002) reported that the recombinant soluble form of HLA-G5 could form a disulfide-linked dimer with the intermolecular Cys42-Cys42 disulfide bond. In addition, the membrane-bound form of HLA-G1 can also form a disulfide-linked dimer on the cell surface of the Jeg3 cell line, which endogenously expresses HLA-G. Disulfide-linked dimer forms of HLA-G1 and HLA-G5 have been found o",

Antibody Affinity</p>In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein has a dissociation constant KD of \u22641 \u03bcM, \u2264100 nM, \u226410 nM, \u22641 nM, \u22640.1 nM, \u22640.01 nM, or \u22640.001 nM (e.g., 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M or less, e.g., from 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M to 10<sup>\u221213 </sup>M, e.g., from 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>M to 10<sup>\u221213 </sup>M).</p>In one preferred embodiment, KD is measured using surface plasmon resonance assays using a BIACORE\u00ae) at 25\u00b0 C. with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at \u02dc10 response units (RU). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIACORE, Inc.) are activated with N-ethyl-N\u2032-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, to 5 \u03bcg/ml (\u02dc0.2 \u03bcM) before injection at a flow rate of 5 \u03bcl/minute to achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen, 1 M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% polysorbate 20 (TWEEN-20\u2122) surfactant (PBST) at 25\u00b0 C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 \u03bcl/min. Association rates (k<sub>on </sub>or ka) and dissociation rates (k<sub>off </sub>or kd) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIACORE\u00ae Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneously fitting the association and dissociation sensorgrams. The equilibrium dissociation constant KD is calculated as the ratio kd/ka (k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>.) See, e.g., Chen, Y. et al., J. Mol. Biol. 293 (1999) 865-881. If the on-rate exceeds 10<sup>6 </sup>M<sup>\u22121 </sup>s<sup>\u22121 </sup>by the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation=295 nm; emission=340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25\u00b0 C. of a 20 nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow equipped spectrophotometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-AMINCO\u2122 spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stirred cuvette.</p>2.

    "ach amino acid difference of the identified frameworks to the parental antibody was judged for impact on the structural integrity of the binder and backmutations towards the parental sequence were considered whenever appropriate.</p>On the other hand, an in silico tool described in WO 2016/062734 was used to predict the orientation of the VH and VL domains of the humanized versions towards each other. This was carried out for the virtual grafts of the CDRs on all possible human germline combinations. The results were compared to the VH VL domain orientation of the parental binder to select for framework combinations which are close in geometry to the starting antibody.</p>Anti-HLAG Antibody Antibodies (SEQ ID Nos of Variable Regions and Hypervariable Regions (HVRs)):</p>Anti-HLAGHVR-HVR-HVR-HVR-HVR-HVR-antibodyH1H2H3L1L2L3VHVLHLA-G-SEQSEQSEQSEQSEQSEQSEQSEQ0031IDIDIDIDIDIDIDIDNO:NO:NO:NO:NO:NO:NO:NO:\u20021\u20022\u20023\u20024\u20025\u20026\u20027\u20028HLA-G-SEQSEQSEQSEQSEQSEQSEQSEQ0031-0104IDIDIDIDIDIDIDID(humanizedNO:NO:NO:NO:NO:NO:NO:NO:variant of\u20021\u20022\u20023\u20024\u20025\u200263334HLA-G-0031)(HLA-G-0104)HLA-G-SEQSEQSEQSEQSEQSEQSEQSEQ0039IDIDIDIDIDIDIDIDNO:NO:NO:NO:NO:NO:NO:NO:\u2002910111213141516HLA-G-SEQSEQSEQSEQSEQSEQSEQSEQ0041IDIDIDIDIDIDIDIDNO:NO:NO:NO:NO:NO:NO:NO:1718192021222324HLA-G-SEQSEQSEQSEQSEQSEQSEQSEQ0090IDIDIDIDIDIDIDIDNO:NO:NO:NO:NO:NO:NO:NO:2526272829303132</p>Example 3A) Binding of Anti HLA-G Antibodies to Soluble Human HLA-G, Soluble Degrafted Human HLA-G with HLA-A Specific Sequence, Human HLA-A2, and Rat/Mouse H2-Kd</p>Antibodies obtained from immunisation were screened for their binding properties to human, HLA-G, chimeric, degrafted HLA-G, HLA-A2 and rat/mouse H2-Kd.
