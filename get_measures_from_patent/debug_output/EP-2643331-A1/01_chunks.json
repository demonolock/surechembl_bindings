    ". Hydrogen peroxide 35% (4.7 mL, 54.6 mmol) excess was added and the mixture was stirred for 1 h. The solvent was removed under vacuum and the residue was quenched with sat. Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and extracted with EtOAc. The organic layers were dried over MgSO<sub>4</sub>. Auto-column (5 hexanes: 5 EtOAc) gave a crude Intermediate 10 as a yellow oil -0.86 g. </p>Example 11 </p> Compound 3 \n\n (2S)-2-amino-3-({3-(2-furyl)-4-[(5^henylpentyl)oxy]phenyl}amino)-3-oxopropyl dihydrogen phosphate </p></p>Intermediate 10 (0.86 g, 1 .19 mmol) was treated with 10 % Pd on C (0.30 g) and hydrogen at 50 psi for 3 h.

The results are tabulated below in Table 2. </p> Table 2 </p>\n Biological examples In vitro assay </p> Connpounds were tested for S1 P1 activity using the GTP y<sup>35</sup>S binding assay. These connpounds may be assessed for their ability to activate or block activation of the human S1 P1 receptor in cells stably expressing the S1 P1 receptor. </p>GTP y<sup>35</sup>S binding was measured in the medium containing (mM) HEPES 25, pH 7.4, MgCI<sub>2</sub> 10, NaCI 100, dithitothreitol 0.5, digitonin 0.003%, 0.2 nM GTP y<sup>35</sup>S, and 5 pg membrane protein in a volume of 150 \u03bc\u0399. Test compounds were included in the concentration range from 0.08 to 5,000 nM unless indicated otherwise. Membranes were incubated with 100 \u03bc\u039c 5'-adenylylimmidodiphosphate for 30 min, and subsequently with 10 \u03bc\u039c GDP for 10 min on ice. Drug solutions and membrane were mixed, and then reactions were initiated by adding GTP y<sup>35</sup>S and continued for 30 min at 25 \u00b0C. Reaction mixtures were filtered over Whatman GF/B filters under vacuum, and washed three times with 3 ml_ of ice-cold buffer (HEPES 25, pH7.4, MgC 10 and NaCI 100). Filters were dried and mixed with scintillant, and counted for <sup>35</sup>S activity using a \u03b2-counter. Agonist-induced GTP y<sup>35</sup>S binding was obtained by subtracting that in the absence of agonist. Binding data were analyzed using a non-linear regression method. In case of antagonist assay, the reaction mixture contained 10 nM S1 P in the presence of test antagonist at concentrations ranging from 0.08 to 5000 nM. </p>Activity potency: S1 P1 receptor from GTP y<sup>35</sup>S: nM, (EC<sub>5</sub>o), </p>Table 3 </p>\n (2S)-2-amino-3-"
