    "the leaves with a liquid containing the virus, and then rubbing the leaves, preferably in the presence of an abrasive powder which wounds the leaf surface to allow penetration of the leaf and infection of the plant. Within a week or two after infection, leaves are harvested and viral nanoparticles are extracted. In the case of cowpea mosaic virus, 100 mg of virus can be obtained from as few as 50 plants. Procedures for obtaining plant picornavirus particles using extraction of an infected plant are known to those skilled in the art. See Wellink J., Meth Mol Biol, 8, 205-209 (1998), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>The plant picornavirus is loaded with the cargo molecule in a non-covalent manner. In some embodiments, the cargo molecule associates with the nucleic acid within the plant picornavirus, inside the viral particle capsid. While not intending to be bound by theory, it appears that the cargo molecule associates with the nucleic acid within the plant picornavirus as a result of the affinity of the cargo molecule for the nucleic acid. Affinity is the tendency of a compound to naturally associate with another object (e.g., a nucleic acid). Affinity is influenced by non-covalent intermolecular interactions between the compound and the object, such as hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic interactions, and Van der Waals forces. As used herein, affinity refers to an interaction between a compound and another object having a dissociation constant of at least one micromolar. However, cargo molecules lacking affinity for nucleic acid can be loaded through gating, in which the virus capsid is exposed to a alkaline solution, which results in swelling and pore opening; the drug is then infused, buffer exchange to neutral solution traps the cargo inside the capsid.</p>The plant picornavirus can be loaded with the cargo molecule in a non-covalent manner relying on simple diffusion from solution into the picornavirus particle by contacting the plant picornavirus with a solution including the cargo molecule. To allow the cargo molecule to diffuse into the plant picornavirus particles, sufficient time should be provided for the diffusion to occur. In various embodiments, at least 5 minutes, at 10 minutes, at least 30 minutes, at least one hour, at least 4 hours, at least 8 hours, or at least 24 hours may be provided to allow diffusion into the plant picornavirus particle. In addition, it is preferable that a molar excess of the cargo molecule be provided in the solution to encourage diffusion into the plant picornavirus particle. The molar excess is the amount of cargo molecule relative to the amount of plant picornavirus present on a per-particle or compound basis. In some embodiments, the molar excess is at least about 500 fold. For example, a molar excess of about 500 to 1000 cargo molecules to plant picornavirus particles, an excess of about 1,000 to 5,000, an excess of about 5,000 to 15,000, or an exc"
