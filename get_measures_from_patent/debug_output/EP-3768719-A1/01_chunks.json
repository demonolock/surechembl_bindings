    "a cells may be cultured in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, immortalized cells. For example, if the parental cells lack the enzyme </p>hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for \n\n the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (\u201cHAT medium\u201d), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells. Preferred immortalized cell lines are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high level expression of antibody by the selected antibody -producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. More preferred immortalized cell lines are murine myeloma lines, which can be obtained, for instance, from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif and the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor, J. Immunol., 133:3001 (1984); Brodeur et al,\u201cMonoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications\u201d Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, (1987) pp. 51-63). The culture medium in which the hybridoma cells are cultured can then be assayed for the presence of monoclonal antibodies directed against PD-L1. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by the hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked </p>immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). Such techniques and assays are known in the art, and are described further in the Examples below or in Harlow and Lane Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Publications, New York, (1988). </p> 66. After the desired hybridoma cells are identified, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution or FACS sorting procedures and grown by standard methods. Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium and RPMI- 1640 medium. Alternatively, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites in a mammal. </p> 67. The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones may be isolated or purified from the culture medium or ascites fluid by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, protein G, hydroxylapatite </p>chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography. </p> 68. The term\u201cisolated\u201d, when applied to binding molecules as defined herein, refers to binding molecules that are substantially free of other proteins or polypeptides, particularly free of other binding molecules having different antigenic specificities, and are also substantially free of other cellular or tissue material and/or chemical precursors or other chemicals. For example, when the binding molecules are recombinantly produced, they are preferably substantially free of culture medium",
    "1 (R&amp;D Systems) at 2 week intervals. After a significant immune response was mounted as measured by serum ELISA, the lymph nodes, spleens and bone marrow cells were harvested, B cells surface expressing IgM isotype antibodies were subtracted with magnetic beads, and the remaining cells were sorted for their ability to bind PD-L1, using a MoFlo Fluorescence -Activated Cell Sorter. \n\n 129. Cells positive for PD-L1 binding were sorted into 96-well plates, subjected to single cell RT-PCR to amplify variable regions, and the variable regions were cloned into expression vectors containing either a heavy chain human IgGl or IgG4 constant region or light chain human IgK constant region. The resulting heavy and light chain clone pairs were transfected into CHO cells, and the resulting antibody protein was purified with protein A resin. </p> 130. The ability of the antibodies to bind native cell-surface PD-L1 was measured using flow cytometry. In brief, purified antibodies were mixed with cells individually, and a fluorescently-labeled secondary antibody was added to the cell-antibody mixture. When the cells were passed through the flow cytometer, the antibodies specific for binding to PD-L1 significantly increased the fluorescence of the cells. </p> 131. The ability of the antibodies to disrupt the interaction of a cell displaying on its surface membrane-bound PD-L1 to another cell displaying on its surface membrane-bound PD-l was evaluated in an in vitro cell reporter assay, and IC50 concentrations were calculated (Table 2). </p>TABLE 2: the identification number and IC50 of activity of each antibody in a two-cell blocking assay of the PD-L 1 /PD-l interaction </p></p> *IC50 shown in micrograms per milliliter 132.
