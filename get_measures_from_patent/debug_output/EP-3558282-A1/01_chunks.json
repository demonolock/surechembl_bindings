    " cancer, including metastatic cancers. </p> [0055] In one embodiment, the mito-met compounds of the present invention comprise metformin modified to include alkyl cationic moieties. In other embodiments, the mito- met compounds of the present invention comprise a metformin compound selected from the group consisting of phenformin, PEG, cy-metformin or pyrformin. </p>[0056] Specifically, the inventors have shown that mitochondria-targeted metformin analogs (Mito-Mets) are significantly more potent than metformin in inhibiting pancreatic cancer cell proliferation. Metformin (Met) is an FDA-approved antidiabetic drug that is currently being repurposed as a promising antitumor drug. As Met targets mitochondria, although not very effectively, we surmised that increasing its mitochondria targeting potential by attaching a positively-charged lipophilic substituent will result in more potent Mito-Mets with enhanced antitumor potential. To this end, Mito-Met analogs conjugated \n\n to varying alkyl chain lengths containing a triphenylphosphonium cation (TPP<sup>+</sup>) were synthesized and characterized. Results show that Mito-Met analog (e.g., Mito-Metio) synthesized by attaching TPP<sup>+</sup> to Met via a 10-carbon aliphatic side chain is nearly 1 ,000 times more effective than Met in inhibiting pancreatic ductal adenoma cell (PDAC) proliferation. Mito-Metio was 2,000-fold more effective than Met in inhibiting mitochondrial complex l-mediated oxygen consumption in MiaPaCa-2 cells (IC50 for Mito-Metio = 0.43 \u03bc\u039c and IC50 for Met = 1 ,088 \u03bc\u039c). Mito-Metio (1 mg/kg) was considerably more potent than Met in abrogating in vivo tumor growth. Results also show that pretreatment of PDACs with Mito-Met at 1 ,000-fold lower concentration than Met enhanced radiosensitization, as measured by a clonogenic assay. Enhanced mitochondrial targeting of Met, combined with enhanced radiosensitizing efficacy could be significantly more beneficial in the treatment of pancreatic carcinoma, an aggressive human cancer with limited chemo- or radio-therapeutic options to improve survival. </p>[0057] In one embodiment, the mito-met compounds of the present invention are as follows: </p>\n wherein n is selected from a positive integer between 1 and 1 1 , wherein in some embodiments: n = 1 - Mito-Metformin-C<sub>2</sub> </p> 5 - Mito-Metformin-C<sub>6</sub> </p> 9 - Mito-Metformin-C-io </p> 1 1 - Mito-Metformin-C-12 \n\n [0058] In one specific embodiment, the mito-met compound of the present invention comprises the following structure: \n\n </p> Mito<sub>12</sub>-Metformin </p>[0059] In one specific embodiment, the mito-met compound of the present invention comprises the following structure: \n\n </p> Mito-io-Metformin </p>[0060] In one specific embodiment, the mito-met compound of the present invention comprises the following structure: \n\n </p> Mito<sub>6</sub>-Metformin </p> [0061 ] In one specific embodiment, the mito-met compound of the present invention comprises the following structure: \n\n </p> Mito -Metformin </p>[00",
    " AMPK- mTOR energy signaling mechanism. Human MiaPaCa-2 and murine FC199 PDAC cells treated with Mito-Metio (1 \u03bc\u039c) or Met (1 mM) for 30 min were lysed, proteins size separated on SDS-PAGE were transferred to PVDF, and probed with an antibody to phosphorylated AMPK threonine-172. Levels of active protein measured as a ratio of active phosphorylated protein relative to total protein show that Mito-Metio induces a 1 .5-2.5-fold increase in active AMPK in both human and murine PDAC cells at nearly 1 ,000-fold lower concentration than Met (Fig. 14B). </p> [00147] Effects of Mito-Met analogs and Metformin on Complex I activity. The oxygen consumption rate was measured using the permeabilized MiaPaCa-2 cells in MAS buffer supplemented with pyruvate. The use of permeabilized cells avoids differences in cellular uptake of compounds. Figure 15A shows OCR changes in control permeabilized cells and in rotenone- or malonate-treated cells. Rotenone (complex I inhibitor) greatly diminished OCR that was restored by added succinate. However, in the presence of malonate (complex II inhibitor) addition of succinate did not stimulate OCR (Fig. 15A). Antimycin A decreased succinate-induced OCR. These studies established the use of permeabilized MiaPaCa-2 cells in bioenergetics function assay. Next we used this model to probe the effects of Metformin and Mito-Metformin analogs. Mito-Metio inhibited OCR at much lower concentrations than Met (10 \u03bc\u039c versus 3,000 \n\n \u03bc\u039c) (Fig. 15B and Fig. 20A-C). The IC50 values for Met and Mito-Metio were determined to be 792 and 2 \u03bc\u039c, respectively (Fig. 20C). We tested the effect of pretreating cells with Mito-Metio or Met using the permeabilized model. MiaPaCa-2 cells were treated with Met and Mito-Metio for 24 h and the oxygen consumption studies were performed in these cells after permeabilization. In contrast to results shown in Figure 15B, a significant decrease in OCR was observed in permeabilized cells after a 24 treatment with Mito-Metio at a much lower concentration (0.75 \u03bc\u039c) for complex I inhibitions (Figs. 15C-D). The IC50 values determined for Met and Mito-Metio in permeabilized cell model were 1.1 mM and 0.4 \u03bc\u039c, respectively. This increased potency of Mito-Metio to inhibit complex I activity is consistent with the &gt;1 , 000-fold enhanced antiproliferative effect of Mito-Metio as compared to Met. </p> [00148] Mito-Met inhibits tumor growth of KPC autografts in vivo. In vivo data show that Mito-Metformin potently halts tumor growth in a preclinical mouse model (Figs. 15E- G). In an initial proof-of-concept experiment, syngeneic KPC cells expressing Firefly luciferase (FC1242-luc) were orthotopically implanted to the pancreas of C57BL/6 mice and tumor growth monitored using bioluminescence imaging (Fig. 15F). Mice orthotopically autografted with FC1242-luc cells were treated daily with 1 mg/kg or 150 mg/kg Met, or 1 mg/kg Mito-Met. Consistent with the cell culture data, Mito-Met was considerably more effective than Met in abrogating PDAC growth (Fig. 10B) and resulted in markedly smaller primary tumors at the completion of the experiment (Figs. 6E-F). Serum from these animals was collected, and hepatic and kidney toxicity tested using standard AST, ALT, AP, and BUN assays, respectively. As predicted from cell culture data (Figs. 10A-D), neither Met nor the mitochondria-targeted analog Mito-Met elicited toxicity in vivo (Table 1 ). </p> [00149] Table 1.
