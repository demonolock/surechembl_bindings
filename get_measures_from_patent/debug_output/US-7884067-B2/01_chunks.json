    "sing CRE-dependent transactivation over that of the vector control (FIG. 12D). In agreement with its effects on N-Cad/CTF2 production, overexpression of FAD mutant PS1 V82L failed to increase significantly the CRE-dependent transactivation compared to WT PS1 transfected controls. This FAD mutant does not significantly increase production of A\u03b242 peptide in cell cultures either (Murayama et al. (1999) Neuro Sci. Len. 265:61-63). The inverse correlation between the effects of PS1 mutants on N-Cad/CTF2 production and CRE-dependent transactivation, observed in all cases, indicates that these mutants over-stimulate transcription by inhibiting production of N-Cad/CTF2.</p>To investigate the consequences of FAD mutations in a physiologically relevant system in the absence of PS1 overexpression, the \u03b5-cleavage of N-cadherin was examined in two independent embryonic fibroblast clones derived from a gene-targeted (knock-in) mouse homozygous for the human PS1 FAD mutation P264L (Siman et al. (2000) J. Neurosci. 20:8717-8726). Expression of the knock-in mutant PS1 allele is under the control of the endogenous PS1 gene. These models are distinct from overexpressing transgenic models because the mutant gene is expressed at normal levels, similar to those observed in WT models (FIG. 13, panel d). As controls, two WT fibroblast cell lines independently derived from WT littermates were used. Membranes from embryonic fibroblast cultures isolated either from PS1 P264L homozygous knock-in mice (KI-3 and KI-1) or from WT littermates (WT-3 and WT-2) were processed for the generation of N-Cad/CTF2. Following incubation, membranes were probed with C32 (FIG. 13A, panels a-c) or 33B10 (FIG. 13A, panel d). Protein extract either from WT (WT-3 and WT-2) or from PS1 P264L knock-in (KI-3 and KI-1) fibroblasts were probed on WBs with anti-c-fos (FIG. 13B, upper panels) and anti-b-tubulin (FIG. 13B, lower panels) antibodies.</p>Production of N-Cad/CTF2 was sensitive to \u03b3-secretase inhibitor L-685,458 (FIG. 13A, lanes 1 and 2). FIG. 13A (lanes 2-5) shows that samples from the knock-in fibroblast cell lines produced undetectable amounts of N-Cad/CTF2 compared to samples from the WT clones, indicating that this FAD mutation also inhibits the \u03b3-cleavage of N-cadherin. Furthermore, the PS1 P264L knock-in cells contained significantly higher levels of endogenous c-fos compared to WT controls, although \u03b2-tubulin levels remained unchanged (FIG. 13B). Thus, the PS1 FAD mutation P264L inhibits N-Cad/CTF2 production and increases the cellular levels of c-fos protein above those detected in normal controls indicating that this mutation induces a dysregulation of c-fos expression by inhibiting the PS1/\u03b5-secretase activity. FIG. 13C is a schematic representation of the effects of the PS1/e-cleavage of N-cadherin on CBP/CREB signaling. This cleavage releases N-cadherin ICD N-Cad/CTF2 that binds CBP and sequesters it to the cytoplasm thus downregulating CREB-mediated transcription. PS1 FAD mutations inhibit N-Cad/CTF2 production and stimulate CBP/CREB-dependent transcription. In neuronal cells, the c-cleavage is stimulated by NMDA receptor activation.</p>"
