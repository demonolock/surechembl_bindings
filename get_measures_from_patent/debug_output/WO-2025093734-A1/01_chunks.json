    "f the sequence encoding CH<sub>2</sub> and the majority of the sequence encoding CH<sub>3</sub>. Thus, the CH<sub>2</sub> domain on its own, or the CH<sub>3</sub> domain on its own, are not considered Fc region. The Fc region may refer to this region in isolation, or this region in the context of an Fc fusion polypeptide. When referring to an antigen binding protein of the invention, the binding to said protein to an antigen refers to a binding reaction which determines the presence of a target protein, peptide, or polysaccharide in the presence of a heterogeneous population of proteins and other biologics. Thus, under designated conditions, an antigen binding protein binds preferentially to a particular target protein, peptide or polysaccharide (such as FIX or FX) and does not bind in a significant amount to other proteins or polysaccharides present in the sample or subject. Specific binding can be determined by methods known in the art. With reference to an antibody antigen complex, specific binding of the antigen and \n\nantibody has a K<sub>d</sub> of less than about 10<sup>-5</sup> Molar, 10<sup>-6</sup> Molar, 10<sup>-7</sup> Molar, such as less than about 10<sup>-7</sup> Molar, 10<sup>-8</sup> Molar, 10<sup>-9</sup>, or even less than about 10<sup>-10</sup> Molar. The terms \"binding activity\" and \"binding affinity\" are intended to refer to the tendency of an antigen-binding protein to bind or not to bind to a target. Binding affinity may be quantified by determining the dissociation constant (Kd) for an antigen-binding protein and its target. Similarly, the specificity of binding of an antigen binding protein to its target may be defined in terms of the comparative dissociation constants (Kd) of the antibody for its target as compared to the dissociation constant with respect to the antigen binding protein and another, non-target molecule. Typically, the Kd for the antibody with respect to the target will be 2-fold, preferably 5-fold, more preferably 10-fold less than the Kd with respect to the other, non- target molecule such as unrelated material or accompanying material in the environment. More preferably, the Kd will be 50-fold less, even more preferably 100-fold less, and yet more preferably 200-fold less. The value of this dissociation constant can be determined directly by well-known methods, and can be computed even for complex mixtures by methods such as those, for example, set forth in Caceci MS and Cacheris WP (1984, Byte, 9, 340-362). For example, the Kd may be established using a double-filter nitrocellulose filter binding assay such as that disclosed by Wong I and Lohman TM (1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90, 5428- 5432) or for example, by using Octet surface plasmon resonance. One method for the evaluation of binding affinity is by ELISA. Other standard assays to evaluate the binding ability of ligands such as antibodies towards targets are known in the art, including for example, Western blots, RIAs, and flow cytometry analysis. The binding kinetics (e.g. binding affinity) of the antibody also can be assessed by standard assays known in the art, such as surface plasmon resonance, for example by Biacore\u2122 system analysis. In one embodiment the antigen binding protein is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are immunoglobulin molecules that are identical to each other and have a single binding specificity and affinity for a particular epitope. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) of the present invention can be produced by a variety of techniques, including conventional monoclonal antibody methodology, for example those disclosed in \u201cMonoclonal Antibodies: a manual of techniques\u201d(Zola H, 1987, CRC Press) and in \n\n\u201cMonoclonal Hybridoma Antibodies: techniques and applications\u201d (Hurrell JGR, 1982 CRC Press). In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the antigen binding protein comprises a first antigen binding domain and a second antigen binding domain. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the first and second antigen binding domains of the antigen binding protein are scFv prot"
