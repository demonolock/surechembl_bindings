{"raw_mentions": "With reference to an antibody antigen complex, specific binding of the antigen and antibody has a Kd of less than about 10^-5 Molar, 10^-6 Molar, 10^-7 Molar, such as less than about 10^-7 Molar, 10^-8 Molar, 10^-9, or even less than about 10^-10 Molar. \nThe value of this dissociation constant can be determined directly by well-known methods, and can be computed even for complex mixtures by methods such as those, for example, set forth in Caceci MS and Cacheris WP (1984, Byte, 9, 340-362). \nOne method for the evaluation of binding affinity is by ELISA. \nThe binding kinetics (e.g. binding affinity) of the antibody also can be assessed by standard assays known in the art, such as surface plasmon resonance, for example by Biacore system analysis."}
