IN VIVO IMAGING AND DETECTION OF FCRNThe peptides of the invention may be used in assays to detect FcRn. In some embodiments, the assay is a binding assay that detects binding of a peptide of the invention with FcRn. In some embodiments, FcRn may be immobilized, and one or more peptides described herein may passed over the immobilized FcRn. In alternative embodiments, one or more peptides may be immobilized, and FcRn may be passed over the immobilized peptide(s). Either FcRn or the peptides of the invention may be detectably labeled. Suitable labels include radioisotopes, including, but not limited to <sup>64</sup>Cu, <sup>67</sup>Cu, <sup>90</sup>Y, <sup>111</sup>In, <sup>124</sup>I, <sup>125</sup>I, <sup>131</sup>I, <sup>137</sup>Cs, <sup>186</sup>Re, <sup>211</sup>At, <sup>212</sup>Bi, <sup>213</sup>Ra, <sup>223</sup>Ra, <sup>241</sup>Am, <sup>2144</sup>Cm, and <sup>99m</sup>Tc-MDP; enzymes having detectable products (for example, luciferase, peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, \u03b2-galactosidase, and the like); fluorophores (including, e.g., fluorescein (which may be attached as, e.g., fluorescein isothiocyanate), rhodamine, phycoerythrin, phycocyanin, allophycocyanin, o-phthaldehyde and fluorescamine); fluorescence emitting metals, for example, <sup>152</sup>Eu, or others of the lanthanide series, attached to the peptides of the invention through metal chelating groups such as EDTA; chemiluminescent compounds, for example, luminol, isoluminol, theromatic acridinium ester, acridinium salts, imidazole, and oxalate esteror; and bioluminescent compounds, for example, luciferin, or aequorin (green fluorescent protein),",
    "r.</p>Example 6Methods for the Determination of Equilibrium Binding Constants (K<sub>D</sub>) for Peptides Using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)The following steps were performed to cross-link soluble human or cynomolgus FcRn to the dextran surface of a CM5 sensor chip (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) by an amine coupling reaction involving 1-ethyl-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) as recommended by Biacore (BIAapplications Handbook, version AB, section 4.2, Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The FcRn protein was diluted in 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5 (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) to a concentration of 10 to 30 \u03bcg/ml and used to coat one flow cell on the sensor chip. Residual sites on the FcRn flow cell were blocked with 1 M ethanolamine hydrochloride pH 8.5 (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). A control flow cell was blocked with ethanolamine for reference subtraction. For analysis of the monomeric peptides, FcRn was coated to a final density of 4000-5000 response units (RU). For analysis of the peptide dimers, FcRn was coated to a density of 2000-2500 RU. All SPR measurements were performed using a BIACORE 3000 Instrument (Biacore AB Uppsala, Sweden). For measurements done at either pH 6 or pH 7.4, experiments were performed in 50 mM phosphate, 100 mM sodium chloride, 0.01% surfactant P20 (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden).</p>A. Representative Procedure for the Determination of Binding Constant of Monomeric Peptides</p>Ten 2-fold dilutions of the peptide were injected over the FcRn-CM5 chip at a rate of 20 \u03bcl/min for 2 min. The peptide was dissociated from the chip for 2.5 minutes with buffer. Any remaining peptide was removed from the chip with a 30 second injection of HBS-P buffer (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) at a rate of 30 \u03bcl/min. Sensorgrams were generated and analyzed using BiaEval software version 3.1 (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The equilibrium RU observed for each injection was plotted against concentration. The equilibrium K<sub>D </sub>values were derived by analysis of the plots using the steady state affinity model included in the BiaEval software.</p>B. Representative Procedure for Determination of Binding Constant of Dimeric Peptides</p>Ten, 2-fold dilutions of the peptide were injected over the FcRn-CM5 chip at a rate of 30 \u03bcl/min for 10 min. Peptides were dissociated from the chip for 10 minutes with buffer. Any remaining peptide was removed from the chip with two, 60 second injections of a solution containing 50 mM Tris-hydrochloride, 100 mM NaCl, 0.01% surfactant P20 pH 9.0 at 100 \u03bcl/min.</p>Sensorgrams were generated and analyzed using BiaEval software version 3.1 (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The equilibrium RU observed for each injection was plotted against concentration. The equilibrium K<sub>D </sub>values were derived by analysis of the plots using the steady state affinity model included in the BiaEval software.</p>Example 7Synthesis of Monomeric Peptides Containing Disulfide BondsSynthesis of monomeric peptides was performed using solid-phase peptide synthesis either manually with a flitted round bottom flask or by using an Advanced Chemtech 396-omega synthesizer (Advanced Chemtech, Louisville, Ky.). Standard Fmoc/tBu protocols were used (W. C. Chan and P. D. White eds., Fmoc Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis: A Practical Approach Oxford University Press Inc. New York (2000)), in combination with a Rink amide resin (Novabiochem, San Diego, Calif.) or PAL-PEG-PS (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) to yield C-terminal amides upon cleavage. The coupling reagents were 2-(1H-Benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3,-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) and N-hydr"
