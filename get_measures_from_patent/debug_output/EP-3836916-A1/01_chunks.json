    "e plates by gentle inversion. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1X phosphate buffered saline-calcium magnesium free (PBS-CMF) for 15 minutes at room temperature, washed 3 times for 5 minutes each in 1X PBS-CMF. Cells were permeabilized in immunofluorescence (IF) blocking buffer (Cell Signaling #12411) containing 0.3% Triton X100. Cells were washed 3 times for 5 minutes each in 1X PBS-CMF and incubated in estrogen receptor a (D6R2W) rabbit primary antibody (Cell Signaling #13258) diluted 1:300 in IF antibody dilution buffer (Cell Signaling #12378). Cells were washed 3 times for 5 minutes each in 1X PBS-CMF and stained with goat anti-rabbit (Biotium #CF770) secondary antibody diluted 1:2000 in IF antibody dilution buffer and normalizing stain CellTag 700 diluted 1:500 (Licor #926-41090). ER protein expression was assessed by the Licor Odyssey CLx imaging system using Image Studio v5.2. Data is processed utilizing GraphPad Prism 7 by subtracting background from the vehicle and setting the vehicle to 100% ER activity, followed by comparing treated samples to vehicle. Example 5. Data from Human ERa Reporter Assay and Estrogen Receptor (ER) degradation assay </p> The procedures in Example 3 and Example 4 were used to produce the data provided in Table 3 below. In the below table for the Estrogen Receptor Degradation Assay and the Human ERa Reporter Assay: </p>*** denotes a &lt;1 mM; IC<sub>50</sub>; </p>** denotes a &lt;50 mM IC<sub>50</sub>; and </p>* denotes a &gt;51 mM IC50. \n\n</p>In the below table for the % Estrogen Receptor Remaining: **** denotes 0-40% Estrogen Receptor remaining. </p>*** denotes 41-70% Estrogen Receptor remaining. </p>** denotes 71-90% Estrogen Receptor remaining. </p>* denotes 91-100% Estrogen Receptor remaining.
