The sizes based on the number of amino acids are shown on the right. The full-length \u03b1 -synuclein is 140 amino acids. Because of the possibility of subtraction from the epitope, GM37, its variants 1-3, and GM285 should bind to both the full-length and 1-119/122, 1-135 fragments. Antibody 9E4 will only bind to full-length and 1-135 fragments. The specific properties of the smaller C-terminal fragment left after truncation are not shown.</p>Figure 9 shows antibodies GM37 and GM285, immunoprecipitates, full-length alpha-synuclein and truncated alpha-synuclein of human brain.

Alpha-synuclein fibrils (PFF) were added to cultures with (PFF +) or without (PFF) test antibody. The presence of GM-37/285 inhibits the formation of truncated alpha-synuclein in cells and secreted into the cell culture medium.</p>Figure 11A shows that GM37 inhibited the formation of truncated bands (12 KD) in both the media and cell lysates of primary mouse cortical cultures treated with PFF. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblots were performed to detect different species of alpha-synuclein. Two bands of monomeric alpha-synuclein were detected at 12kDa and 14kDa in cells treated with PFF or control antibody only (B12), representing truncated and full-length alpha-synuclein, respectively. There was only a faint band of 12Kd in the presence of GM-37, indicating that most of the lysis was blocked. This effect is also reflected in the culture medium of the cells. The relative level of accumulation may also be inhibited by the presence of GM-37, as reflected in a decrease in the relative intensity of the 14Kd band. Alternatively, there may be a reduced number of cell-ingestible 14Kd bands. (example 5).</p>Figure 11B shows dose-dependent inhibition of alpha-synuclein fibril proteolysis by antibodies GM37, GM37 variant 2, and GM285. At low antibody concentrations (0,1 ug/ml), there was one band representing full-length (FL) \u03b1 -synuclein and one band representing C-terminally truncated (CT) \u03b1 -synuclein in cell lysates of primary mouse cortical cultures (indicated by arrows). Increasing antibody concentrations to 1ug/ml, 5ug/ml and 10ug/ml resulted in a decrease in the proteolysis of alpha-synuclein fibrils in cells. This was observed with antibodies GM37, GM37v2 and GM285. Control samples were treated with a human IgG1 antibody B12 that does not recognize a-s",

In one embodiment, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the invention binds to its target (human alpha synuclein) at least 10-fold more strongly than another molecule; preferably at least 50 times stronger and more preferably at least 100 times stronger. Preferably, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof binds under physiological conditions (e.g., in vivo). Thus, an antibody that is capable of \"specifically binding\" to an epitope within residues 112-117 (ILEDMP (SEQ ID No: 9)) of human \u03b1 -synuclein includes an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof that is capable of binding to an epitope within residues 112-117 of human \u03b1 -synuclein with such specificity and/or under such conditions. Methods suitable for determining such binding are known to those of ordinary skill in the art, and exemplary methods are described in the accompanying examples.

The amount of low affinity is dependent on the antibody's KD, such that when the antibody's KD is very low (i.e., the antibody is highly specific), the amount of affinity for the antigen is at least 10,000 times lower than the affinity for the non-specific antigen.</p>As used herein, the term \"kd\" (sec-1 or 1/s) refers to the off-rate constant for a particular antibody-antigen interaction.

Thus, such a preparation does not include naturally occurring serum or a purified derivative of such serum, the preparation comprising a mixture of anti-a-synuclein antibodies and another antibody that does not alter the functionality of the anti-a-synuclein antibodies of the preparation; wherein such functionality is selected from the group consisting of:</p>(i) The binding affinity (KD) of the anti-alpha-synuclein antibody to alpha-synuclein;</p>(ii) The ability of the anti-a-synuclein antibody to inhibit protease truncation of a-synuclein fibrils;</p>(iii) The ability of the anti-a-synuclein antibody to reverse injury of basal synaptic transmission in F28-snca transgenic mice;</p>(iv) The ability of the anti-a-synuclein antibody to reduce a-synuclein levels in the mouse hippocampus as measured by in vivo microdialysis; and</p>(v) The ability of the anti-alpha-synuclein antibody to restore motor function when administered chronically in a rat model of Parkinson's disease;</p>(vi) The ability to prevent seeding of alpha-synuclein (e.g., accumulation of insoluble phosphorylated alpha-synuclein in vitro and/or in a mouse model of parkinson's disease); and/or</p>(vii) The ability to bind truncated alpha-synuclein in the human brain.</p>The invention specifically relates to a preparation of an anti-a-synuclein antibody having a structural alteration in its amino acid sequence (in any of its CDRs, variable domains, framework residues, and/or constant domains) relative to the structure of a naturally occurring anti-a-synuclein antibody, wherein the structural alteration is such that the anti-a-synuclein antibody exhibits a significantly altered functionality relative to the functionality exhibited by the naturally occurring anti-a-synuclein antibody (i.e., in terms of functionality, more than 20% difference, more than 40% difference, more than 60% difference, more than 80% difference, more than 100% difference, more than 150% difference, more than 2-fold difference, more than 4-fold difference, more than 5-fold difference, or more than 10-fold difference); wherein such functionality is:</p>(i) The binding affinity (KD) of the anti-alpha-synuclein monoclonal antibody to alpha-synuclein;</p>(ii) The ability of the anti-alpha-synuclein monoclonal antibody to inhibit protease truncation of alpha-synuclein fibrils;</p>(iii) The ability of the anti- \u03b1 -synuclein monoclonal antibody to reverse injury of basal synaptic transmission in F28-snca transgenic mice;</p>(iv) The ability of the anti-a-synuclein monoclonal antibody to reduce a-synuclein levels in the mouse hippocampus as measured by in vivo microdialysis; and/or</p>(v) The ability of an anti-alpha-synuclein monoclonal antibody to restore motor function when administered chronically in a rat model of Parkinson's disease;</p>(vi) The ability to prevent seeding of alpha-synuclein (e.g., accumulation of insoluble phosphorylated alpha-synuclein in vitro and/or in a mouse model of parkinson's disease); and/or</p>(vii) The ability to bind truncated alpha-synuclein in the human brain.</p>Especially where such altered functionality is a result of structural changes and is therefore indistinguishable from it.</p>The term \"substantially free of\" naturally occurring antibodies means that such naturally occurring antibodies are either completely absent from such preparations or are included in such preparations at concentrations that do not substantially affect the \u03b1 -synuclein binding properties of the preparations.

    "ich has a major protease sensitive site at amino acids 119/122. To investigate the protease truncation \u03b1 -synuclein, mouse primary cortical neurons were prepared as described in Elvang et al (2009), 2009, 110 (5): 1377-87, and treated with cytarabine in DIV3 (3 days in vitro) to inhibit astrocyte growth. Neurons were treated with ultrasound (5 min, at 50% power in a cup angle sonicator) at a final concentration of 0.7 \u03bc M at DIV4 (4 days in vitro) with preformed \u03b1 -synuclein fibrils (PFF) alone or with the indicated concentrations of antibody. After 24 hours of culture, the medium was harvested and the cells lysed. Both the media and cell lysates were subjected to western immunoblotting using the 4B12 antibody (fig. 11A) (Pierce Ma 1-90346) and a second anti-mouse antibody. After probing with 4B12+ anti-mouse, the blot was stripped and re-probed with anti-human IgG antibody. On the blot using 4B12, it can be seen that there are strong bands at 14 and 12kDa in the medium of cells treated with PFF alone, where 14kDa represents full-length alpha-synuclein (FL-ASYN) and 12kDa represents the C-terminally truncated fragment 1-119/122 (CT-ASYN). In addition, there are higher molecular weight bands, most likely representing the SDS-resistant oligomer species. Co-treatment with isotype control antibody B12 did not alter this pattern of proteolysis or uptake.</p>In the culture medium from cells treated with fibrils together with 37, there was predominantly full-length \u03b1 -synuclein (14 kD) and a small amount of terminal truncated band (12 kD). In cell lysates from cells treated with fibrils together with 37, only full-length \u03b1 -synuclein was present, indicating that 37 prevented the lysis of FL- \u03b1 -synuclein. In addition, the total amount of FL- \u03b1 -synuclein was reduced relative to cells treated with PFF or B12 control antibody alone. Several groups have shown that alpha-synuclein can be cleaved by calpain-1 (Games et al, J. USA Pathol, vol.182, no.3, 3.2013 months; ricke et al, health, vol.4, J. T. J. 1167-1177, 2012 Mishizen-Eberz, biochemistry, 2005, 44, 7818-7829; dufty et al, J. USA Pathol (Am J. Pathol), vol.170, no.5, 2007 5 months). The cleavage site of calpain-1 for fibrillar alpha-synuclein has been found in region 114-122 (Mishizen-Eberz, J. Neurochem., 86, 836-847, 2003). 1-119/122 in the transgenic animal and human brain appears to be the major cleavage product in alpha-synuclein in vivo, which, after cleavage, possibly aspartic acid 119 or asparagine 122, is deamidated to aspartic acid and cleaved by calpain or another protease with similar cleavage specificity. These results indicate that antibody 37 is capable of inhibiting C-terminal truncation of alpha-synuclein. The epitope of antibody GM37 overlaps with the enzyme calpain-1 binding site, so binding of 37 to \u03b1 -synuclein can directly inhibit binding and cleavage mediated by calpain-1 (fig. 10 and 11).</p>285 overlap with the epitope of 37 and are also expected to inhibit protease cleavage. 37v2 differs from 37 only at one amino acid of the C",
    "entration was determined and samples were run on 4% -12% SDS_PAGE gels, blotted on membranes, and detected for alpha-synuclein and phosphorylated alpha-synuclein (S129P) by 4B12/1904 antibody (Seimer science: MA1-90346 human synuclein), S129P-asyn antibody (Albekan 51253), and mouse synuclein antibody (cell signal-D37A 6), respectively.</p>Figure 12B shows western immunoblots of soluble and insoluble fractions of primary neurons with and without coarse seeds. As can be seen in FIG. 12B, the addition of seeds resulted in the accumulation of endogenous mouse \u03b1 -synuclein and multimers of p-S129- \u03b1 -synuclein and phosphorylated mouse \u03b1 -synuclein in the insoluble fraction of the cells.</p>To test whether the antibodies were able to inhibit seeding, \u03b1 -synuclein seeds were used at a concentration of 6.6nM (10 ng/well). Different concentrations of antibody and alpha-synuclein seeds were added together on DIV6 to obtain a dose response (starting from the highest antibody concentration of 133nM and dropping to 133 pM). Neurons were fixed again and phosphosynuclein (albekin 51253) was stained and fluorescence in cells was quantified using an automated fluorescence microscope (Cellomics arrayscan). Spots/dots from each well were counted in a Cellomics arrayscan. As can be seen in fig. 12C, antibodies 37, 37v2 and antibody 285 all reduced alpha-synuclein phosphorylation in neurons in a dose-dependent manner with similar maximal inhibition (around 70% -75%) of 37, 37v2 and 285 using an EC50 of about 5 nM. Cellular proteins were fractionated into soluble and insoluble fractions after treatment with the highest concentration (133 nM) of antibody, showing that antibodies 37, 37v2 and 285 inhibited the accumulation of truncated and C-terminally truncated fragments (CT a-syn) of recombinant crude seeds and reduced the accumulation of phosphorylated endogenous mouse \u03b1 -synuclein and aggregated forms of mouse \u03b1 -synuclein in the insoluble fraction, as shown in fig. 12D.</p>Example 7 acute electrophysiological Effect of alpha-synuclein antibodies in vivo</p>High expression levels of human alpha-synuclein are present in the hippocampus of F28-snca transgenic mice, a model for overexpression of wild-type alpha-synuclein under the control of the mouse alpha-synuclein promoter (Westerlund.

Synaptic transmission and plasticity of the hippocampus CA1 region in 4-to 6-month old male F28-snca transgenic and age-matched control mice was evaluated by in vivo electrophysiology. The data indicate that basal synaptic transmission is significantly impaired in F28-snca transgenic mice compared to age-matched control mice (fig. 13).</p>F28-snca transgenic mice aged 4 to 6 months and age-matched control male mice (CRO bred, taconic Europe a/S) were individually housed under controlled temperature (22 \u2103 \u00b1 1.5 \u2103) and humidity (55% -65%) conditions and maintained in a 12 hour lig"
