    " believed to be critical in producing a matrix competent to undergo mineral replacement. (Paine, C. T. et al. (1998) Connect Tissue Res. 38:257-267). Tuftelin mRNA has been found to be expressed in human ameloblastoma tumor, a non-mineralized odontogenic tumor (Deutsch, D. et al. (1998) Connect. Tissue Res. 39:177-184). </p> Olfactomedin-related proteins are extracellular matrix, secreted glycoproteins with conserved C-terminal motifs. They are expressed in a wide variety of tissues and in broad range of species, from Caenorhabditis elegans to Homo sapiens. Olfactomedin-related proteins comprise a gene family with at least 5 family members in humans. One of the five, TIGR/myocilin protein, is expressed in the eye and is associated with the pathogenesis of glaucoma (Kulkarni, N. H. et al. (2000) Genet. Res. 76:41-50). Research by Yokoyama et al. (1996) found a 135-amino acid protein, termed AMY, having 96% sequence identity with rat neuronal olfactomedin-releated ER localized protein in a neuroblastoma cell line cDNA library, suggesting an essential role for AMY in nerve tissue (Yokoyama, M. et al. (1996) DNA Res. 3:311-320). Neuron-specific olfactomedin-related glycoproteins isolated from rat brain cDNA libraries show strong sequence similarity with olfactomedin. This similarity is suggestive of a matrix-related function of these glycoproteins in neurons and neurosecretory cells (Danielson, P. E. et al. (1994) J. Neurosci. Res. 38:468-478). </p> Mac-2 binding protein is a 90-kD serum protein (90K), a secreted glycoprotein isolated from both the human breast carcinoma cell line SK-BR-3, and human breast milk. It specifically binds to a human macrophage-associated lectin, Mac-2. Structurally, the mature protein is 567 amino acids in length and is proceeded by an 18-amino acid leader. There are 16 cysteines and seven potential N-linked glycosylation sites. The first 106 amino acids represent a domain very similar to an ancient protein superfamily defined by a macrophage scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain (Koths, K. et al. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268:14245-14249). 90K is elevated in the serum of subpopulations of AIDS patients and is expressed at varying levels in primary tumor samples and tumor cell lines. Ullrich et al. (1994) have demonstrated that 90K stimulates host defense systems and can induce interleukin-2 secretion. This immune stimulation is proposed to be a result of oncogenic transformation, viral infection or pathogenic invasion (Ullrich, A., et al. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269:18401-18407). </p> Semaphorins are a large group of axonal guidance molecules consisting of at least 30 different members and are found in vertebrates, invertebrates, and even certain viruses. All semaphorins contain the sema domain which is approximately 500 amino acids in length. Neuropilin, a semaphorin receptor, has been shown to promote neurite outgrowth in vitro. The extracellular region of neuropilins consists of three different domains: CUB, discoidin, an",
    "ests that the gene of interest is also present, the presence and expression of the gene may need to be confirmed. For example, if the sequence encoding SECP is inserted within a marker gene sequence, transformed cells containing sequences encoding SECP can be identified by the absence of marker gene function. Alternatively, a marker gene can be placed in tandem with a sequence encoding SECP under the control of a single promoter. Expression of the marker gene in response to induction or selection usually indicates expression of the tandem gene as well. </p> In general, host cells that contain the nucleic acid sequence encoding SECP and that express SECP may be identified by a variety of procedures known to those of skill in the art. These procedures include, but are not limited to, DNA-DNA or DNA-RNA hybridizations, PCR amplification, and protein bioassay or immunoassay techniques which include membrane, solution, or chip based technologies for the detection and/or quantification of nucleic acid or protein sequences. </p> Immunological methods for detecting and measuring the expression of SECP using either specific polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies are known in the art. Examples of such techniques include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), radioimmunoassays (RIAs), and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). A two-site, monoclonal-based immunoassay utilizing monoclonal antibodies reactive to two non-interfering epitopes on SECP is preferred, but a competitive binding assay may be employed. These and other assays are well known in the art. (See, e.g., Hampton, R. et al. (1990) Serological Methods, a Laboratory Manual, APS Press, St. Paul Minn., Sect. IV; Coligan, J. E. et al. (1997) Current Protocols in Immunology, Greene Pub. Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York N.Y.; and Pound, J. D. (1998) Immunochemical Protocols, Humana Press, Totowa N.J.) </p> A wide variety of labels and conjugation techniques are known by those skilled in the art and may be used in various nucleic acid and amino acid assays. Means for producing labeled hybridization or PCR probes for detecting sequences related to polynucleotides encoding SECP include oligolabeling, nick translation, end-labeling, or PCR amplification using a labeled nucleotide. Alternatively, the sequences encoding SECP, or any fragments thereof, may be cloned into a vector for the production of an mRNA probe. Such vectors are known in the art, are commercially available, and may be used to synthesize RNA probes in vitro by addition of an appropriate RNA polymerase such as T7, T3, or SP6 and labeled nucleotides. These procedures may be conducted using a variety of commercially available kits, such as those provided by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Promega (Madison Wis.), and US Biochemical. Suitable reporter molecules or labels which may be used for ease of detection include radionuclides, enzymes, fluorescent, chemiluminescent, or chromogenic agents, as well as substrates, cofactors,",
    "scription and translation of protein-coding sequences operably associated with the T7, T3, or SP6 promoters. Translation takes place in the presence of a radiolabeled amino acid precursor, for example, <sup>35</sup>S-methionine. </p> SECP of the present invention or fragments thereof may be used to screen for compounds that specifically bind to SECP. At least one and up to a plurality of test compounds may be screened for specific binding to SECP. Examples of test compounds include antibodies, oligonucleotides, proteins (e.g., receptors), or small molecules. </p> In one embodiment, the compound thus identified is closely related to the natural ligand of SECP, e.g., a ligand or fragment thereof, a natural substrate, a structural or functional mimetic, or a natural binding partner. (See, e.g., Coligan, J. E. et al. (1991) Current Protocols in Immunology 1(2): Chapter 5.) Similarly, the compound can be closely related to the natural receptor to which SECP binds, or to at least a fragment of the receptor, e.g., the ligand binding site. In either case, the compound can be rationally designed using known techniques. In one embodiment, screening for these compounds involves producing appropriate cells which express SECP, either as a secreted protein or on the cell membrane. Preferred cells include cells from mammals, yeast, Drosophila, or E. coli. Cells expressing SECP or cell membrane fractions which contain SECP are then contacted with a test compound and binding, stimulation, or inhibition of activity of either SECP or the compound is analyzed. </p> An assay may simply test binding of a test compound to the polypeptide, wherein binding is detected by a fluorophore, radioisotope, enzyme conjugate, or other detectable label. For example, the assay may comprise the steps of combining at least one test compound with SECP, either in solution or affixed to a solid support, and detecting the binding of SECP to the compound. Alternatively, the assay may detect or measure binding of a test compound in the presence of a labeled competitor. Additionally, the assay may be carried out using cell-free preparations, chemical libraries, or natural product mixtures, and the test compound(s) may be free in solution or affixed to a solid support. </p> SECP of the present invention or fragments thereof may be used to screen for compounds that modulate the activity of SECP. Such compounds may include agonists, antagonists, or partial or inverse agonists. In one embodiment, an assay is performed under conditions permissive for SECP activity, wherein SECP is combined with at least one test compound, and the activity of SECP in the presence of a test compound is compared with the activity of SECP in the absence of the test compound. A change in the activity of SECP in the presence of the test compound is indicative of a compound that modulates the activity of SECP. Alternatively, a test compound is combined with an in vitro or cell-free system comprising SECP under conditio",
    "ton, D. R. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:10134-10137.) </p> Antibodies may also be produced by inducing in vivo production in the lymphocyte population or by screening immunoglobulin libraries or panels of highly specific binding reagents as disclosed in the literature. (See, e.g., Orlandi, R. et al. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:3833-3837; Winter, G. et al. (1991) Nature 349:293-299.) </p> Antibody fragments which contain specific binding sites for SECP may also be generated. For example, such fragments include, but are not limited to, F(ab\u2032)<sub>2 </sub>fragments produced by pepsin digestion of the antibody molecule and Fab fragments generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of the F(ab\u2032)2 fragments. Alternatively, Fab expression libraries may be constructed to allow rapid and easy identification of monoclonal Fab fragments with the desired specificity. (See, e.g., Huse, W. D. et al. (1989) Science 246:1275-1281.) </p> Various immunoassays may be used for screening to identify antibodies having the desired specificity. Numerous protocols for competitive binding or immunoradiometric assays using either polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies with established specificities are well known in the art. Such immunoassays typically involve the measurement of complex formation between SECP and its specific antibody. A two-site, monoclonal-based immunoassay utilizing monoclonal antibodies reactive to two non-interfering SECP epitopes is generally used, but a competitive binding assay may also be employed (Pound, supra). </p> Various methods such as Scatchard analysis in conjunction with radioimmunoassay techniques may be used to assess the affinity of antibodies for SECP. Affinity is expressed as an association constant, K<sub>a</sub>, which is defined as the molar concentration of SECP-antibody complex divided by the molar concentrations of free antigen and free antibody under equilibrium conditions. The K<sub>a </sub>determined for a preparation of polyclonal antibodies, which are heterogeneous in their affinities for multiple SECP epitopes, represents the average affinity, or avidity, of the antibodies for SECP. The K<sub>a </sub>determined for a preparation of monoclonal antibodies, which are monospecific for a particular SECP epitope, represents a true measure of affinity. High-affinity antibody preparations with K<sub>a </sub>ranging from about 10<sup>9 </sup>to 10<sup>12 </sup>L/mole are preferred for use in immunoassays in which the SECP-antibody complex must withstand rigorous manipulations. Low-affinity antibody preparations with K<sub>a </sub>ranging from about 10<sup>6 </sup>to 10<sup>7 </sup>L/mole are preferred for use in immunopurification and similar procedures which ultimately require dissociation of SECP, preferably in active form, from the antibody (Catty, D. (1988) Antibodies. Volume I: A Practical Approach, IRL Press, Washington D.C.; Liddell, J. E. and A. Cryer (1991) A Practical Guide to Monoclonal Antibodies, John Wil",
    "the viral capsid proteins. This subgenomic RNA replicates to higher levels than the full length genomic RNA, resulting in the overproduction of capsid proteins relative to the viral proteins with enzymatic activity (e.g.; protease and polymerase). Similarly, inserting the coding sequence for SECP into the alphavirus genome in place of the capsid-coding region results in the production of a large number of SECP-coding RNAs and the synthesis of high levels of SECP in vector transduced cells. While alphavirus infection is typically associated with cell lysis within a few days, the ability to establish a persistent infection in hamster normal kidney cells (BHK-21) with a variant of Sindbis virus (SIN) indicates that the lytic replication of alphaviruses can be altered to suit the needs of the gene therapy application (Dryga, S. A. et al. (1997) Virology 228:74-83). The wide host range of alphaviruses will allow the introduction of SECP into a variety of cell types. The specific transduction of a subset of cells in a population may require the sorting of cells prior to transduction. The methods of manipulating infectious cDNA clones of alphaviruses, performing alphavirus cDNA and RNA transfections, and performing alphavirus infections, are well known to those with ordinary skill in the art. </p> Oligonucleotides derived from the transcription initiation site, e.g., between about positions \u221210 and +10 from the start site, may also be employed to inhibit gene expression. Similarly, inhibition can be achieved using triple helix base-pairing methodology. Triple helix pairing is useful because it causes inhibition of the ability of the double helix to open sufficiently for the binding of polymerases, transcription factors, or regulatory molecules. Recent therapeutic advances using triplex DNA have been described in the literature. (See, e.g., Gee, J. E. et al. (1994) in Huber, B. E. and B. I. Carr, Molecular and Immunologic Approaches, Futura Publishing, Mt. Kisco N.Y., pp. 163-177.) A complementary sequence or antisense molecule may also be designed to block translation of mRNA by preventing the transcript from binding to ribosomes. </p> Ribozymes, enzymatic RNA molecules, may also be used to catalyze the specific cleavage of RNA. The mechanism of ribozyme action involves sequence-specific hybridization of the ribozyme molecule to complementary target RNA, followed by endonucleolytic cleavage. For example, engineered hammerhead motif ribozyme molecules may specifically and efficiently catalyze endonucleolytic cleavage of sequences encoding SECP. </p> Specific ribozyme cleavage sites within any potential RNA target are initially identified by scanning the target molecule for ribozyme cleavage sites, including the following sequences: GUA, GUU, and GUC. Once identified, short RNA sequences of between 15 and 20 ribonucleotides, corresponding to the region of the target gene containing the cleavage site, may be evaluated for secondary structural features which may render the oligonucleotide inoperable. The suitability of candidate targets may also be evaluated by testing access",
    "d Peroxidase Assay Kit from Molecular Probes together with a fluorescence microplate reader or fluorometer. </p> An assay for growth stimulating or inhibiting activity of SECP measures the amount of DNA synthesis in Swiss mouse 3T3 cells (McKay, I. and Leigh, I., eds. (1993) Growth Factors: A Practical Approach, Oxford University Press, New York, N.Y.). In this assay, varying amounts of SECP are added to quiescent 3T3 cultured cells in the presence of [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine, a radioactive DNA precursor. SECP for this assay can be obtained by recombinant means or from biochemical preparations. Incorporation of [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine into acid-precipitable DNA is measured over an appropriate time interval, and the amount incorporated is directly proportional to the amount of newly synthesized DNA. A linear dose-response curve over at least a hundred-fold SECP concentration range is indicative of growth modulating activity. One unit of activity per milliliter is defined as the concentration of SECP producing a 50% response level, where 100% represents maximal incorporation of [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine into acid-precipitable DNA. </p> Alternatively, TGF-\u03b2 activity is measured by induction of non-neoplastic normal rat kidney fibroblasts to undergo anchorage-independent growth in the presence of epidermal growth factor (2.5 ng/ml) as described by Assoian, R. K. et al. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258:7155-7160. </p> Alternatively, an assay for SECP activity measures the stimulation or inhibition of neurotransmission in cultured cells. Cultured CHO fibroblasts are exposed to SECP. Following endocytic uptake of SECP, the cells are washed with fresh culture medium, and a whole cell voltage-clamped Xenopus myocyte is manipulated into contact with one of the fibroblasts in SECP-free medium. Membrane currents are recorded from the myocyte. Increased or decreased current relative to control values are indicative of neuromodulatory effects of SECP (Morimoto, T. et al. (1995) Neuron 15:689-696). </p> Alternatively, an assay for SECP activity measures the amount of SECP in secretory, membrane-bound organelles. Transfected cells as described above are harvested and lysed. The lysate is fractionated using methods known to those of skill in the art, for example, sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. Such methods allow the isolation of subcellular components such as the Golgi apparatus, ER, small membrane-bound vesicles, and other secretory organelles. Immunoprecipitations from fractionated and total cell lysates are performed using SECP-specific antibodies, and immunoprecipitated samples are analyzed using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting techniques. The concentration of SECP in secretory organelles relative to SECP in total cell lysate is proportional to the amount of SECP in transit through the secretory pathway. </p> Alternatively, an assay for measuring protein kinase activity of SECP is performed by quantifying the phosphorylation of a protein substrate by SECP in the "
