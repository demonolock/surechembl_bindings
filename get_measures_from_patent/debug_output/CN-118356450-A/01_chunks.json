    "he function of prolonging life and beautifying, is mainly applied to tea beverage brewing and health care products in the market at present, and has simpler utilization form.</p>The Huangshan tribute chrysanthemum is rich in various active ingredients, mainly including flavonoids, organic acids, volatile oils, amino acids, saccharides, trace elements and the like. The flos Chrysanthemi contains flavone and chlorogenic acid compounds as main active ingredients. The flavonoids have the main effects of resisting oxidation and treating cardiovascular diseases. The antioxidant activity of the water extract of the Huangshan tribute chrysanthemum and the flavone are in dose-effect relationship, so that the capability of scavenging free radicals can be improved and the aging can be further delayed when the water extract of the Huangshan tribute chrysanthemum is drunk by multiple brewing tribute chrysanthemum. The flavone in the tribute chrysanthemum can improve the activity of SOD of liver tissues and reduce the content of malondialdehyde, thereby achieving the effect of protecting liver.</p>The aloperine (Alexine) was isolated from pods of the broad bean (leguminosae) in 1988. Chemical name: (1 r,2r,3r,7s,7 as) -3- (hydroxymethyl) hexahydro-1H-pyrrolidine-1, 2, 7-triol of formula: c <sub>8</sub>H<sub>15</sub>NO<sub>4</sub>, relative molecular mass: 189, the chemical formula is as follows:</p></p> the literature reports that the aloperine has an inhibitory effect on glycosidase, the IC50 for the trehalose is 5.9X10 <sup>-5</sup> mol/L, and the IC <sub>50</sub> for the fungus glucan 1, 4-alpha glucosidase is 1.1X10 <sup>-5</sup> mol/L. </p>However, no other activity of the aloperine has been reported in the prior art.</p>Disclosure of Invention</p>The applicant of the invention has conducted intensive studies on the tribute chrysanthemum, and found that after the tribute chrysanthemum extract is prepared by 80% ethanol, the tribute chrysanthemum extract is compatible with the aloperine and other auxiliary materials, and the obtained eyeshield is safe and nonirritant, and has more excellent curative effects of improving eyestrain, conjunctivitis, conjunctival microcirculation and the like compared with the existing eyeshield which independently uses the chrysanthemum extract.</p>The application firstly discloses a preparation method of tribute chrysanthemum extract, which comprises the following steps:</p> Step 1), taking a Huangshan tribute chrysanthemum sample, putting the sample into a drying oven, adjusting the temperature of the drying oven to 50 \u2103, drying for 48 hours, taking out the sample, and crushing and sieving the sample by a crusher (100 meshes); </p> Step 2) taking 100g of a crushed sample of the Huangshan tribute inulin, adding 12 times of 80% ethanol, soaking for 3 hours, and carrying out suction filtration to obtain a filtrate; </p> Step 3) taking filter residues in the step 2), adding 10 times of 80% ethanol, decocting for 2 hours, and ca"
