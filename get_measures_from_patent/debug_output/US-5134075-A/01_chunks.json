Kisco, New York (1986); and Cancer Diagnosis In Vitro Using Monoclonal Antibodies, Kupchik (ed.) Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, (1988)).</p>Most of the known monoclonal antibodies are reactive with several types of human carcinomas, while a few antibodies react with carcinomas derived from specific organs of the body, e.g., lung, breast, ovary, colon, stomach or pancreas. The target antigens are commonly glycoproteins or glycolipids (see, e.g., Hellstrom et al., Cancer Research 46:3917-23 (1986); and Fink et al., Prog. Clin. Pathol., 9:121-33 (1984)). For example, monoclonal antibodies reactive with glycoprotein antigens on specific types of carcinomas include those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,737,579 (monoclonal antibodies to non-small cell lung carcinomas), U.S. Pat. No. 4,753,894 (monoclonal antibodies to human breast cancer), U.S. Pat. No. 4,579,827 (monoclonal antibodies to human gastrointestinal cancer), and U.S. Pat. No. 4,713,352 (monoclonal antibodies to human renal carcinoma). Some monoclonal antibodies react with high molecular weight antigens which appear to be mucins. For example, monoclonal antibody B72.3 appears to recognize a tumor-associated oncofetal glycoprotein antigen of greater than 1,000 kd molecular weight that is selectively expressed on a number of different carcinomas. Thus, B72.3 has been shown to react with 84% of breast carcinomas, 94% of colon carcinomas, 100% of ovarian carcinomas and 96% of non-small-cell lung carcinomas (see Johnston, Acta Cytol., 1 (5):537-56 (1987) and U.S. Pat. No. 4,612,282, issued to Schlom et al.). Similarly, monoclonal antibody KC-4 recognizes an approximately 400-500 kd protein antigen expressed on a number of carcinomas, such as colon, prostate, lung and breast carcinoma (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,708,930).</p>Monoclonal antibodies reactive with glycolipid antigens that are believed to be associated with certain tumor cells have also been disclosed. For example, Young et al., J. Exo. Med., 150:1008-19 (1979) disclose the production of two monoclonal antibodies specific for asialo GM<sub>2</sub>, a cell surface glycosphingolipid antigen that was established as a marker for BALB/c 3T3 cells transformed by Kirsten murine sarcoma virus. See, also, Kniep et al., J. Immunol., 131 (3):1591-94 (1983) and U.S. Pat. No. 4,507,391 (monoclonal antibody to human melanoma).</p>In addition, monoclonal antibodies reactive with glycolipid antigens found on specific types of carcinoma cells include those described by Rosen et al., Cancer Research. 44:2052-61 (1984) (monoclonal antibodies to human small cell lung cancer); Varki et al., Cancer Research, 44:681-87 (1984) (monoclonal antibodies to human adenocarcinomas of the lung, stomach and colon and melanoma), and U.S. Pat. No. 4,579,827 (monoclonal antibodies to human colon adenocarcinoma). See, also, Hellstrom et al., Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA, 83:7059-63 (1986) which describes the L6 monoclonal antibody that recognizes a carbohydrate antigen expressed on the surface of human non-small cell lung carcinomas, breast carcinomas and colon carcinomas.</p>Additional monoclonal antibodies exhibiting a reactivity t"
