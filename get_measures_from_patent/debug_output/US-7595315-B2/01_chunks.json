    "porter leads to a rise in the concentration of that neurotransmitter within the synaptic cleft. Compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts preferably exhibit a K<sub>i </sub>value less than 600 nM at the norepinephrine transporter as determined using the scintillation proximity assay described below. More preferred compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts exhibit a K<sub>i </sub>value less than 100 nM at the norepinephrine transporter. More preferred compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts exhibit a K<sub>i </sub>value less than 50 nM at the norepinephrine transporter. Especially preferred compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts exhibit a K<sub>i </sub>value less than 20 nM at the norepinephrine transporter. Preferably, compounds of the present invention selectively inhibit the norepinephrine transporter relative to the serotonin and dopamine transporters by a factor of at least five, more preferably by a factor of at least ten using the scintillation proximity assays described below.</p>In addition, the compounds of the present invention are preferably acid stable. Advantageously, they have a reduced interaction (both as substrate and inhibitor) with the liver enzyme Cytochrome P450 (CYP2D6). That is to say, they preferably exhibit less than 75% metabolism via the CYP2D6 pathway according to the CYP2D6 substrate assay described below and they preferably exhibit an IC50 of &gt;6 \u03bcM according to the CYP2D6 inhibitor assay described below.</p>In view of their pharmacological activity, the compounds of the present invention are indicated for the treatment of disorders of the central and/or peripheral nervous system, in particular, disorders associated with norepinephrine dysfunction in mammals, especially humans, including children, adolescents and adults.</p>The term \u201cnorepinephrine dysfunction\u201d as used herein refers to a reduction in the amount of norepinephrine neurotransmitter within the synaptic cleft below that which would be considered to be normal or desirable for a species, or an individual within that species. Thus the phrase \u201cdisorders associated with norepinephrine dysfunction in mammals\u201d refers to disorders which are associated with a reduction in the amount of norepinephrine neurotransmitter within the synaptic cleft below that which would be considered to be normal or desirable for the mammalian species, or an individual within the species, in question. Disorders associated with norepinephrine dysfunction in mammals include, for example, nervous system conditions selected from the group consisting of an addictive disorder and withdrawal syndrome, an adjustment disorder (including depressed mood, anxiety, mixed anxiety and depressed mood, disturbance of conduct, and mixed disturbance of conduct and mood), an age-associated learning and mental disorder (including Alzheimer's disease), alcohol addiction, allergies (in particula",
    "ephrine Transporter.</p>The compounds of the present invention are norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and possess excellent activity in, for example, a scintillation proximity assay (e.g. J. Gobel, D. L. Saussy and A. Goetz, J. Pharmacol. Toxicolo. (1999), 42, 237-244). Thus <sup>3</sup>H-nisoxetine binding to norepinephrine re-uptake sites in a cell line transfected with DNA encoding human norepinephrine transporter binding protein is used to determine the affinity of ligands at the norepinephrine transporter.</p>Membrane Preparation:</p>Cell pastes from large scale production of HEK-293 cells expressing cloned human norepinephrine transporters are homogenized in 4 volumes 50 mM Tris-HCl containing 300 mM NaCl and 5 nM KCl, pH 7.4. The homogenate is centrifuged twice (40,000 g, 10 min, 4\u00b0 C.) with pellet re-suspension in 4 volumes of Tris-HCl buffer containing the above reagents after the first spin and 8 volumes after the second spin. The suspended homogenate is centrifuged (100 g, 10 min, 4\u00b0 C.) and the supernatant kept and re-centrifuged (40,000 g, 20 min, 4\u00b0 C.). The pellet is resuspended in Tris-HCl buffer containing the above reagents along with 10% w/v sucrose and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). The membrane preparation is stored in aliquots (1 ml) at \u221280\u00b0 C. until required.

Samples may be taken at the beginning of the study and after 3, 6 and 24 hours and analysed by capillary electrophoresis. The original sample used in the study may contain 0.8% of the undesired epimer as internal standard. If the tested compound is chemically and configurationally stable under acidic conditions the samples taken at the different time points during the study should not show any significant change in the percentage of the undesired epimer.</p>In Vitro Determination of the Interaction of Compounds with CYP2D6 in Human Hepatic Microsomes</p>Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is a mammalian enzyme which is commonly associated with the metabolism of around 30% of pharmaceutical compounds. Moreover, this enzyme exhibits genetic polymorphism, resulting in the presence of both normal and poor metabolizers in the population. A low involvement of CYP2D6 in the metabolism of compounds (i.e. the compound being a poor substrate of CYP2D6) is desirable in order to reduce any variability from subject to subject in the pharmacokinetics of the compound. Also, compounds with a low inhihibitor potential for CYP2D6 are desirable in order to avoid drug-drug interactions with co-administered drugs that are substrates of"
