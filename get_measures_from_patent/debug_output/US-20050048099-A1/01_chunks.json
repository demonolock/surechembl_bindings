Preferably, at least about 99% of the particles have a diameter of s than about 20 \u03bcm. </p> The active agent can be selected from the group consisting of ace-inhibitors, endogenous cytokines, agents that influence basement membrane, agents that influence the growth of endothelial cells, adrenergic agonists or blockers, cholinergic agonists or blockers, aldose reductase inhibitors, analgesics, anesthetics, antiallergics, anti-inflammatory agents, steroids (such as a steroidal anti-inflammatory agent), antihypertensives, pressors, antibacterials, antivirals, antifungals, antiprotozoals, anti-infective agents, antitumor agents, antimetabolites, and antiangiogenic agents. Thus, the active agent can be cortisone, dexametha"
