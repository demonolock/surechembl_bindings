    "cits a polyspecific CTL response, contrary to a simple mixture of the three peptides; b) the capacity of the polypeptide to induce a polyspecific CTL response depends on its internal organization: among the six variants corresponding to all possible arrangements of the three peptides, only one produced a trispecific CTL response in almost all experiments with mice and human cells.</p>A first aspect of the invention is hence a polypeptide which comprises the sequence YLQVNSLQTVX<sub>1</sub>X<sub>2</sub>X<sub>3</sub>YLEYRQVPVX<sub>1</sub>X<sub>2</sub>X<sub>3</sub>YLEEITGYL (SEQ ID No: 1). In this sequence, the TERT<sub>988Y</sub>, MAGE-A<sub>248V9 </sub>and HER-2/neu<sub>402Y </sub>epitopes are separated by spacers X<sub>1</sub>X<sub>2</sub>X<sub>3</sub>, in which X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2 </sub>and X<sub>3 </sub>are any amino acid or none. The polypeptide is hence at least 28-aminoacids long; its length can be increased by the addition of spacers between the epitopes, and/or by the addition of signals, at its N-terminal and/or C-terminal extremities, which favor its processing. In particular, the polypeptide according to the invention can further comprise an endoplasmic reticulum-translocating signal sequence at its N-terminal extremity. Several endoplasmic reticulum-translocating signal sequences have been described in the scientific literature and cane be used in the context of the invention. For example, the Ig kappa-chain signal sequence (Ishioka et al., 1999), and the E3/19-kD protein signal sequence (Anderson et al., 1991) can be added at the N-terminal extremity of the peptides according to the invention. Alternatively or in addition, the polypeptide according to the invention can further comprise ubiquitin at its C-terminal extremity, since ubiquitination of proteins results in increased proteolysis.</p>In a preferred embodiment of the polypeptide according to the invention, X<sub>1</sub>=X<sub>2</sub>=X<sub>3</sub>=none. This means that the three epitopes are directly bound to each other. In the absence of ubiquitin and ER-translocating signal, the polypeptide is hence the Poly-6 polypeptide illustrated in the examples below, the sequence of which is YLQVNSLQTVYLEYRQVPVYLEEITGYL (SEQ ID No: 2).</p>According to another embodiment, the spacers between the epitopes are AAY, which means that X<sub>1</sub>=X<sub>2</sub>=A and X<sub>3</sub>=Y.</p>In the polypeptides according to the invention, the amino acids can be either L- or D-amino acids.</p>A polypeptide according to the invention preferably exhibits one or both of the following properties, which are indicative of good immunogenicity:\nit induces a trispecific CD8+ T cells response against TERT<sub>988Y</sub>, MAGE-A<sub>248V9</sub>, and HER-2/neu<sub>402Y</sub>, in a majority of HHD mice vaccinated with said polypeptide;it induces a trispecific CD8+ T cells response against TERT<sub>988Y</sub>, MAGE-A<sub>248V9</sub>, and HER-2/neu<sub>402Y </sub>in an in vitro assay with human PBMC from hea"
