    "e, and the isomers of d- methadone [(S)-(+)- methadone HCl] and /-methadone [(R)-(-)-methadone HCl], were obtained from Lilly Research Laboratory (Indianapolis, IN). Synaptic membranes were prepared from rat forebrain (\"FB\") (i.e. whole brain minus cerebellum and brainstem) and spinal cord (\"SPCD\") (i.e., lumbar-sacral section) according to procedures modified from Wong et al, \"[<sup>3</sup>H]MK-801 Labels on Site on the N-methyl-D-aspartate Receptor Channel Complex in Rat Brain Membranes,\" J. Neurochem., 50:274-281 (1988), which is hereby incorporated by reference). Tissue was pooled from 4 to 6 rats and homogenized in 50 ml of ice-cold 0.32 M sucrose solution (Brinkmann Polytron (Westbury, NY) homogenizer, setting 5), then centrifuged at 3,000 x g for 5 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. The supernatant and buffer layer were then centrifuged at 21,500 x g for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C. The P<sub>2</sub> pellet was resuspended in 5 mM ice-cold Tris HCl buffer, pH 7.4, and incubated with 0.04% Triton X at 37 \u00b0C for 20 minutes. The suspension was centrifuged at 39,000 x g for 14 minutes at 4\u00b0C, and the pellet was then resuspended in ice-cold buffer, and recentrifuged at 39,000 x g as described for a total of 3 times. The pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of 0.32 M sucrose solution and aliquots were frozen at - 70\u00b0C for at least 24 hours. On the day of the assay, an aliquot of membranes was thawed at room temperature, \n\nwashed 4 times (39,000 x g, 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C), then the pellet was homogenized in the binding assay buffer to achieve a final concentration of 200 to 300 \u03bcg protein (forebrain) or 300 to 400 \u03bcg protein (spinal cord), as determined by Lowry et al, \"Protein Measurement with Folin Phenol Reagent,\" J. Biol. Chem., 193:265- 275 (1951), which is hereby incorporated by reference, in a 250 \u03bcl total assay volume.</p>For forebrain, the [<sup>3</sup>H]MK-801 binding assay was performed as previously described in Ebert et al, \"Ketobemidone, Methadone, and Pethidine are Non-Competitive Antagonists in the Rat Cortex and Spinal Cord,\" Neurosci. Lett., 187(3): 165- 168 (1995), which is hereby incorporated by reference. Triplicates of the membranes were incubated for 4 hours at room temperature in 5 mM Tris HC1/HEPES buffer, pH 7.6, containing 1 \u03bcM glycine, 50 \u03bcM /-glutamic acid, 5 nM [<sup>3</sup>H]M-801, and competing drug or buffer control in a final volume of 250 \u03bcl Non-specific binding was defined by the addition of 200 \u03bcM unlabeled MK-801. For spinal cord, the concentrations of glycine and /-glutamic acid were increased to 30 \u03bcM and 50 \u03bcM, respectively, to improve binding, and the incubation time was decreased to 2 hours. [<sup>3</sup>H]CGS- 19755 binding assays were conducted according to procedures modified from Murphy et al, \"Characterization of the Binding of [<sup>3</sup>H]- CGS 19755: A Novel N-methyl-D-aspartate Antagonist with Nanomolar Affinity in the Rat Brain,\" Br. J. Pharmacol, 95:932-938 (1988), which is hereby incorporated by reference. Triplicates of forebrain were incubated for 50 minutes at 4\u00b0C in 50 mM tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 10 nM [<sup>3</sup>H]CSG-19755 and the competitor drug or buffer control in a final volume of 250 \u03bcl. Non-specific binding was defined by the addition of 100 unlabeled \u03bcM 1-glutamic acid. Bound ligand as separated from free ligand by filtration using a 24 well Brandel cell harvester (Gaithersberg, MD) followed by two washes with 2 ml of ice-cold binding buffer. The amount of ligand bound to the filter (Brandel GF/B filter paper, preincubated for 30 minutes in 0.05% polyethylenimine) was measured by use of a liquid scintillation counter after 12 hours in 5 ml of Ecoscint scintillation fluid. Specific binding was defined as the mean total cpm's bound minus mean \n\nnon-specific cpm's bound. Assays were replicated 2 to 4 times. IC<sub>50</sub> values were determined from linear regression analysis as described in Katz, Y., et al, \"Interactions Between Laudanosine, GABA, and Opioid Subtype Receptors: Implication for Laudanosine Seizure Activity,\" Brain Res., 646:235-241 (1994), which is hereby incorporated by reference. K<sub>j</sub> values were calculated according to Cheng et al, \"Relationship Between the Inhibition Constant (Ki) and the Concentration of Inhibitor which Causes 50 Percent Inhibition of an Enzymatic Reaction,\" Biochem. Pharmacol. 22:3099-3104 (1973), which is hereby incorporated by reference. Figure 1A shows representative curves for the displacement of</p>[<sup>3</sup>H]MK-801 binding produced by selected opioids and dextromethorphan with forebrain. In the concentration ranges tested, morphine, hydromorphone, and naltrexone did not displace [<sup>3</sup>H]MK-801 (data are not shown for hydromorphone and naltrexone). However, (//-methadone, (/-methadone, and /-methadone produced displacement curves similar to dextromethorphan, although the opioid active /- isomer appeared to be slightly more potent than its opioid inactive ( -isomer or dl- methadone. Figure IB shows a representative displacement curve for the compounds of interest with spinal cord. Since initial assays indicated that IC<sub>50</sub> values were lower in spinal cord than in forebrain, lower concentrations of the compounds were tested. ( /-Methadone, its d- and /-isomers, and dextromethorphan exhibited similar displacement curves. \n\n</p>A summary of mean K, values listed in Table 1 below, compares the ability of the compounds of interest to displace [<sup>3</sup>H]MK-801 and [<sup>3</sup>H]CGS-19755 binding.</p>Table 1</p></p>Data are represented as mean\u00b1SEM for 2 to 4 observations;</p>K, was calculated from the assay IC<sub>50</sub> values using K<sub>d</sub>=4.3 nM<sup>a</sup>,</p>K<sub>d</sub>=7.0 nM<sup>a</sup> (M"
