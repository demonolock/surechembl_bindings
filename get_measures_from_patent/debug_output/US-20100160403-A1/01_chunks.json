The NS3 protease is located in the N-terminal domain of the NS3 protein, and is considered a prime drug target since it is responsible for an intramolecular cleavage at the NS3/4A site and for downstream intermolecular processing at the NS4A/4B, NS4B/5A and NS5A/5B junctions. Previous research has identified classes of peptides, such as hexapeptides as well as tripeptides discussed in U.S. patent applications US2005/0020503, US2004/0229818, and US2004/00229776, showing degrees of activity in inhibiting the NS3 protease. The aim of the present invention is to provide further compounds which exhibit activity against the HCV NS3 protease.</p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to novel macrocyclic compounds of formula (I) and/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or hydrates thereof. These compounds are useful in the inhibition of HCV (hepatitis C virus) NS3 (nonstructural 3) protease, the prevention or treatment of one or more of the symptoms of HCV infection, either as compounds or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts or hydrates (when appropriate), or as pharmaceutical composition ingredients, whether or not in combination with other HCV antivirals, anti-infectives, immunomodulators, antibiotics or vaccines. More particularly, the present invention relates to a compound of formula (Ia), (Ib) or (Ic) and/or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or hydrate thereof:</p><img id=\"EMI-C00002\" path=\"US20100160403A1-20100624-C00002.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/133784609/US/20100624/A1/020100/16/04/03/US20100160403A1-20100624-C00002.TIF\"/>R<sup>1 </sup>is:</p><img id=\"EMI-C00003\" path=\"US20100160403A1-20100624-C00003.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/133785005/US/20100624/A1/020100/16/04/03/US20100160403A1-20100624-C00003.TIF\"/></p>MM is CO or a bond;</p>XX is O, NH, N(C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>4 </sub>alkyl), a bond or CH<sub>2</sub>;</p>Het<sup>1 </sup>is a heterocycle and can be substituted with up to ten groups selected independently from WW or R<sup>5</sup>;</p>R<sup>f </sup>is A<sup>3</sup>;</p>each WW is independently H, halo, OR<sup>77</sup>, C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6 </sub>alkyl, CN, CF<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, SR<sup>77</sup>, CO<sub>2</sub>R<sup>77</sup>, CON(R<sup>77</sup>)<sub>2</sub>, C(O)R<sup>77</sup>, N(R<sup>100</sup>)C(O)R<sup>77</su",
    "or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds.</p>Unless expressly stated to the contrary, substitution by a named substituent is permitted on any atom in a ring (e.g., aryl, a heteroaromatic ring, or a saturated heterocyclic ring) provided such ring substitution is chemically allowed and results in a stable compound. A \u201cstable\u201d compound is a compound which can be prepared and isolated and whose structure and properties remain or can be caused to remain essentially unchanged for a period of time sufficient to allow use of the compound for the purposes described herein (e.g., therapeutic or prophylactic administration to a subject).</p>As a result of the selection of substituents and substituent patterns, certain of the compounds of the present invention can have asymmetric centers and can occur as mixtures of stereoisomers, or as individual diastereomers, or enantiomers. All isomeric forms of these compounds, whether isolated or in mixtures, are within the scope of the present invention.</p>As would be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art, certain of the compounds of the present invention can exist as tautomers. For the purposes of the present invention a reference to a compound of formula I, II, II-a, II-b, II-c, II-d, III, III-a, III-b, III-c or III-d is a reference to the compound per se, or to any one of its tautomers per se, or to mixtures of two or more tautomers.</p>The compounds of the present inventions are useful in the inhibition of HCV protease (e.g., HCV NS3 protease) and the prevention or treatment of infection by HCV. For example, the compounds of this invention are useful in treating infection by HCV after suspected past exposure to HCV by such means as blood transfusion, exchange of body fluids, bites, accidental needle stick, or exposure to patient blood during surgery.</p>The compounds of this invention are useful for isolating enzyme mutants, which are excellent screening tools for more powerful antiviral compounds. Furthermore, the compounds of this invention are useful in establishing or determining the binding site of other antivirals to HCV protease, e.g., by competitive inhibition. Thus the compounds of this invention are commercial products to be sold for these purposes.</p>The compounds of the present invention may be administered in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salt\u201d refers to a salt which possesses the effectiveness of the parent compound and which is not biologically or otherwise undesirable (e.g., is neither toxic nor otherwise deleterious to the recipient thereof). Suitable salts include acid addition salts which may, for example, be formed by mixing a solution of the compound of the present invention with a solution of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, or benzoic acid. Many of the compounds of the invention carry an acidic moiety, in which case suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can include alkali metal salts (e.g., sodium or potassium salts), alkaline earth metal salts (e.g., calcium or magnesium salts), and salts formed with suitable organic ligands such as quaternary ammonium salts. Also, in the case of an acid (\u2014COOH) or alcohol group being present, pharmaceutically acceptable esters can be employed to modify the solubility or hydrolysis characteristics of the compound.</p>The term \u201cadministration\u201d and variants thereof (e.g., \u201cadministering\u201d a compound) in reference to a compound of the invention mean providing the compound or a prodrug of the compound to the individual in need of t",
    "riants are each understood to include concurrent and sequential provision of the compound or salt (or hydrate) and other agents.</p>As used herein, the term \u201ccomposition\u201d is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combining the specified ingredients.</p>By \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d is meant that the ingredients of the pharmaceutical composition must be compatible with each other and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.</p>The term \u201csubject\u201d (alternatively referred to herein as \u201cpatient\u201d) as used herein refers to an animal, preferably a mammal, most preferably a human, who has been the object of treatment, observation or experiment</p>The term \u201ceffective amount\u201d as used herein means that amount of active compound or pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological or medicinal response in a tissue, system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. In one embodiment, the effective amount is \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d for the alleviation of the symptoms of the disease or condition being treated. In another embodiment, the effective amount is a \u201cprophylactically effective amount\u201d for prophylaxis of the symptoms of the disease or condition being prevented. The term also includes herein the amount of active compound sufficient to inhibit HCV NS3 protease and thereby elicit the response being sought (i.e., an \u201cinhibition effective amount\u201d). When the active compound (i.e., active ingredient) is administered as the salt, references to the amount of active ingredient are to the free acid or free base form of the compound.</p>For the purpose of inhibiting HCV NS3 protease and preventing or treating HCV infection, the compounds of the present invention, optionally in the form of a salt or a hydrate, can be administered by any means that produces contact of the active agent with the agent's site of action. They can be administered by any conventional means available for use in conjunction with pharmaceuticals, either as individual therapeutic agents or in a combination of therapeutic agents. They can be administered alone, but typically are administered with a pharmaceutical carrier selected on the basis of the chosen mute of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. The compounds of the invention can, for example, be administered orally, parenterally (including subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal injection or infusion techniques), by inhalation spray, or rectally, in the form of a unit dosage of a pharmaceutical composition containing an effective amount of the compound and conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles. Liquid preparations suitable for oral administration (e.g., suspensions, syrups, elixirs and the like) can be prepared according to techniques known in the art and can employ any of the usual ",
    "e, administration of the compound within seconds, minutes, or hours of the administration of one or more other active agents. For example, a unit dose of the compound can be administered first, followed within seconds or minutes by administration of a unit dose of one or more other active agents. Alternatively, a unit dose of one or more other active agents can be administered first, followed by administration of a unit dose of the compound within seconds or minutes. In some cases, it may be desirable to administer a unit dose of the compound first, followed, after a period of hours (e.g., 1-12 hours), by administration of a unit dose of one or more other active agents. In other cases, it may be desirable to administer a unit dose of one or more other active agents first, followed, after a period of hours (e.g., 1-12 hours), by administration of a unit dose of the compound.</p>In still yet another embodiment, the present application provides for the use of a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for the preparation of a medicament for treating an HCV infection.</p>The HCV NS3 protease inhibitory activity of the present compounds may be tested using assays known in the art. One such assay is HCV NS3 protease time-resolved fluorescence (TRF) assay as described in Example 56. Other examples of such assays are described in e.g., International patent publication W02005/046712. Compounds useful as HCV NS3 protease inhibitors would have a Ki less than 50 [tM, more preferably less than 10 [tM, and even more preferably less than 100 nM.</p>The present invention also includes processes for making compounds of formula I, II, II-a, II-b, II-c, II-d, III, III-a, III-b, III-c, or III-d. The compounds of the present invention can be readily prepared according to the following reaction schemes and examples, or modifications thereof, using readily available starting materials, reagents and conventional synthesis procedures.
