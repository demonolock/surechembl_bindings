The \u03b2-sheet mimetic of structure (13b) above was synthesized according to the procedures disclosed in Example 1, and used in this experiment .</p>\n  All inhibition assays of this experiment were performed at room temperature in 96 well microplates using a Bio-Rad microplate reader (Model 3550). 0.29 mg of structure (13b) was dissolved into 200 ml of 0.02 N hydrochloric acid deionized water solution. This solution (2.05 mM) served as the stock solution for all the inhibition assays. The hydrolysis of chromogenic substrates was monitored at 405 nm. The reaction progress curves were recorded by reading the plates typically 90 times with 30 seconds to 2 minute intervals. The initial rate were determined by unweighted nonlinear least-squares fitting to a first order reaction in GraFit. The determined initial velocities were then nonlinear least- square fitted against the concentrations of structure (13b) using GraFit to obtain IC50. Typically, eight structure (13b) concentration points were employed for IC50 determination.</p>\n  For the thrombin assay, N-p-tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg- pNA (from Sigma) was used at 0.5 mM concentration in 1% \n\n 13 7</p>\n  DMSO (v/v) pH 8.4 Tris buffer as substrate. From structure (13b) stock solution two steps of dilution were made. First, 1:2000 dilution into 0.02 N hydrochloride solution, then 1:100 dilution into pH 8.4 Tris buffer. The final dilution of structure (13b) served as the first point (10 nM) . Seven sequential dilutions were made from the first point with a dilution factor of 2. Into each reaction well, 100 \u03bcl of 10 nM thrombin solution and 50 \u03bcl of structure (13b) solution was added. The mixture of the enzyme and inhibitor was incubated for 20 minutes, then 100 \u03bcl of 0.5 mM substrate solution was added to initiate the reaction. The IC50 of structure (13b) against thrombin was found to be 1.2\u00b10.2 nM.</p>\n  In the Factor VII assay, S-2288 (from Pharmacia) , D-Ile-Pro-Arg-pNA was used at 20 \u03bcM in deionized water as substrate. From the stock of structure (13b), a 1:100 dilution was made into pH 8.0 Tris buffer. This dilution served as the first point of the inhibitor (20 \u03bcM) . From this concentration point 6 more sequential dilutions were made with a dilution factor of 2. 50 \u03bcl of 16 nM FVIIa and TF complex solution and 40 \u03bcl of the inhibitor solutions were added into each well, the mixtures were incubated for 20 minutes before 10 \u03bcl of 20 mM S-2288 was added. IC50 of structure (13b) against factor VII was found to be 140\u00b13 nM.</p>\n  In the Factor X assay, buffer and substrate are the same as used for thrombin assay. A 1:100 dilution was made into pH 8.4 Tris buffer to serve as the first point. Seven dilutions with a dilution factor of 2 were made. The assay protocol is the same as for thrombin except 25 nM of bovine factor Xa (from Sigma) in pH 8.4 Tris buffer \n\n 138</p>\n  was used instead of thrombin. IC50 of structure (13b) against factor X was found to be 385\u00b117 nM.</p>\n  In the urokinase assay, buffer was pH 8.8 0.05 M Tris and 0.05 M NaCl in deionized water. S-2444 (from Sigma), pyroGlu-Gly-Arg-pNA at 0.5 mM in water was utilized as substrate. The same dilution procedure was used as for Factor VII and Factor X. Assay protocol is the same as for thrombin except 18.5 nM of human urokinase (from Sigma) was utilized. IC50 was found to be 927\u00b1138 nM.</p>\n  Tissue Plasminogen Activator (t-PA) : Buffer, substrate and the dilution scheme of structure (13b) were the same as utilized for Factor VII assay.</p>\n  Activated Protein C (aPC) : Buffer was the same as used in thrombin assay. 1.25 mM S-2366 in the assay buffer was utilized as substrate. Dilutions of structure (13b) were the same as in urokinase assay.</p>\n  Plasmin: Buffer ( see thrombin assay) ; S-2551 (from Pharmacia), D-Val-Leu-Lys-pNA at 1.25 mM in assay buffer was utilized as substrate. For dilutions of structure (13b) ( see urokinase assay) .</p>\n  In the trypsin assay, pH 7.8 Tris (0.10 M Tris and 0.02 M CaCl2) was utilized as the buffer. BAPNA (from Sigma) was used at 1 mg/ml in 1% DMSO (v/v) deionized water solution as substrate. The same dilutions of structure (13b) were made as for Factor VII assay. 40 \u03bcl of 50 \u03bcg/ml bovine trypsin (from Sigma) and 20 \u03bcl of structure (13b) solution were added to a reaction well, the mixture was incubated for 5 minutes before 40 \u03bcl of 1 mg/ml BAPNA was added to initiate the reaction. The IC50 \n\n 13 9</p>\n  of structure (13b) against trypsin was found to be 160\u00b18 nM.</p>\n  In the above assays, (D) FPR-CH<sub>2</sub>C1 (\"PPACK\") was run as a control.

    "n DMF until a negative Kaiser test was achieved. Treatment of the resin with 25% piperidine in DMF then cleaved the FMOC group. Following washing with DMF a dienoic acid was coupled to the resin-bound linkers using PyBOP, HOBt and Hunigs' base in DMF until the result of a Kaiser test was negative. The cycloaddition was performed by pretreatment of a solution of a pyrazolidinedione (not shown) or urazole in DMF with a solution of [bis (trifluoroacetoxy) iodo] benzene in DMF. The polymer-supported diene was treated with the resulting solution for 2-16 hours. The resin was then washed with DMF and CH<sub>2</sub>C1<sub>2</sub>. Oxidation to the ketoamide was effected by treatment of the resin with a solution of Dess-Martin periodinane in DMSO for 60 min. The resin was washed with CH<sub>2</sub>C1<sub>2</sub> and the product was cleaved from the resin by treatment of the resin with 95:5 TFA:H<sub>2</sub>0 for 1-12 h. The supernatant was collected and the resin was washed with additional TFA. The combined filtrates were concentrated in vacuo . The residue was precipitated with diethyl ether and the ether was decanted. The resulting solid was reconstituted in 1:1 CH<sub>3</sub>CN : H<sub>2</sub>0 and lyophilized. Compounds (100) through (227) in Tables 11-15 each gave the expected \n\n 225</p>\n  (M+H\") peak when submitted to LCMS (ES+) . The compounds were assayed for inhibition of coagulation enzymes as mixtures of diastereomers.</p>\n  All of the compounds listed in Tables 11-15 had Ki &lt; 100 nM as thrombin inhibitors, or had activity as Factor Vila inhibitors (Table 15) . The compounds noted with an \"*\" in Tables 11-15 had a Ki &lt; 10 nM as thrombin inhibitors and represent preferred embodiments.</p>\n  Table 11</p>\n  \n    \n\n  </p>\n  99/41276</p>\n  226</p>\n  Cpd.
