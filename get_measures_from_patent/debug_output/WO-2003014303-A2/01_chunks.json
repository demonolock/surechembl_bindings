    "ns.</p>The columns in each table are numbered from left to right such that the left-most column in each table is column 1 and the right-most column in each table is column 7. Thus, the first column in each table is labeled \"AVC LD\"; this column simply lists an internal reference number used to refer to the carboxyl-terminal amino acids of the PL proteins listed in the second column. Thus, the second column labeled \"PL\" lists the various PL peptides that were identified as binding a PDZ protein. All PL peptides were biotinylated at the amino-terminus and the sequences of these PL peptides are presented in TABLE 8 (see end of specification). \n\n The PDZ protein (or proteins) that interact(s) with a PL peptide are listed in the fourth column of each table that is labeled \"PDZ\". This column provides the gene name for the PDZ portion of the GST-PDZ fusion that interacts with the PDZ-ligand to the left. For PDZ domain-containing proteins with multiple domains, the domain number is listed to the right of the PDZ (i.e., in column 5 labeled \"PDZ Domain\"), and indicates the PDZ domain number when numbered from the amino-terminus to the carboxy-terminus.</p>The third column labeled \"Peptide Optimal Concentration\" in the tables is a number reflective of the binding interaction between the PL protein and PDZ protein. If a '0' is listed, this is an indication that an interaction was observed using a PL peptide concentration of 10 uM in the assay; any other value listed is indicative of the Kd (dissociation constant) in uM determined by titration of the PL peptide on the concentration of PDZ protein listed in TABLE 7 and 12 (see infra for methods for determining Kd). The column labeled \"Protein Optimal Concentration\" refers to the protein concentration used to assay PL interaction (in ug/ml); a '0' is indicative of 5 ug/ml protein concentration; any other value represents the concentration (in ug/ml) used to determine the dissociation constant for a given interaction.</p>Finally, the seventh column labeled \"Classification\" is another measure of the level of binding. In particular, it provides an absorbance value at 450 nm which indicates the amount of PL peptide bound to the PDZ protein. The following numerical values have the following meanings: ' 1 ' - A<sub>450</sub>nm 0-1 ; '2' - A<sub>450</sub>nm 1-2; '3 '- A<sub>450</sub>nm 2-3; '4' - A<sub>450</sub>nm 3-4; '5' - A<sub>450</sub>nm of 4 more than 2X repeated; '0' - A<sub>450</sub>nm 0, i.e., not found to interact. Thus, higher numbers indicate stronger interactions.</p>Further information regarding these PL proteins and PDZ proteins is provided in TABLES 8 and 9. In particular, TABLE 8 provides a listing of the amino acid sequences of peptides used in the assays. When numbered from left to right, the first column labeled \"AVC LD\" provides the internal designation number used to refer to a particular PL protein and correlates with the designation used in TABLE 7 or TABLE 12. The column labeled \"AVC Name\" provides the name of the gene containing a predicted PDZ ligand. The third column labeled \"Sequence\" is the amino acid sequence of the PL protein used in the assay. The final two columns labeled \"Accession No. and GI list the Genbank accession number or GI number corresponding to the sequence and gene name. As indicated supra, all peptides are biotinylated at the amino terminus and the amino acid sequences correspond to the C-terminal sequ",

    " at step (2) the peptide concentration is 10 uM instead of 20 uM. This results in slightly lower sensitivity for detection of interactions with low affinity and/or rapid dissociation rate. Co\u03c0espondingly, it slightly increases the certainty that detected interactions are of sufficient affinity and half-life to be of biological importance and useful therapeutic targets. The \"G' ' assay\" is identical to the \"G\u00b0 assay\" except that at step (2) the peptide concentration is 1 uM instead of 20 uM and the incubation is performed for 60 minutes at 25\u00b0C (rather than, e.g., 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C followed by 20 minutes at 25\u00b0C). This results in lower sensitivity for interactions of low affinity, rapid dissociation rate, and/or affinity that is less at 25\u00b0C than at 4\u00b0C. Interactions will have lower affinity at 25\u00b0C than at 4\u00b0C if (as we have found to be generally true for PDZ-ligand binding) the reaction entropy is negative (i.e. the entropy of the products is less than the entropy of the reactants). In contrast, the PDZ-PL binding signal can be similar in the \"G\" assay\" and the \"G\u00b0 assay\" for interactions of slow association and dissociation rate, as the PDZ-PL complex will accumulate during the longer incubation of the \"G\" assay.\" Thus comparison of results of the \"G\" assay\" and the \"G\u00b0 assay\" can be used to estimate the relative entropies, enthalpies, and kinetics of different PDZ- PL interactions. (Entropies and enthalpies are related to binding affinity by the equations delta G = RT In (Kd) = delta H - T delta S where delta G, H, and S are the reaction free energy, enthalpy, and entropy respectively, T is the temperature in degrees Kelvin, R is the gas constant, and Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant). In particular, interactions that are detected only or much more strongly in the \"G\u00b0 assay\" generally have a rapid dissociation rate at 25\u00b0C (tl/2 &lt; 10 minutes) and a negative reaction entropy, while interactions that are detected similarly strongly in the \"G\" assay\" generally have a slower dissociation rate at 25\u00b0C (tl/2 &gt; 10 minutes). Rough estimation of the thermodynamics and kinetics of PDZ-PL interactions (as can be achieved via comparison of results of the \"G\u00b0 assay\" versus the \"G\" assay\" as outlined supra) can be used in the design of efficient inhibitors of the interactions. For example, a small molecule inhibitor based on the chemical structure of a PL that \n\ndissociates slowly from a given PDZ domain (as evidenced by similar binding in the \"G\" assay\" as in the \"G\u00b0 assay\") can itself dissociate slowly and thus be of high affinity.</p>In this manner, variation of the temperature and duration of step (2) of the \"G assay\" can be used to provide insight into the kinetics and thermodynamics of the PDZ-ligand binding reaction and into design of inhibitors of the reaction.</p>Assay Variations</p>As discussed supra, it will be appreciated that many of the steps in the above- described assays can be varied, for example, various substrates can be used for binding the PL and PDZ-containing proteins; different types of PDZ containing fusion proteins can be used; different labels for detecting PDZ/PL interactions can be employed; and different ways of",
    "olecule (e.g., the binding of a ligand to a receptor). Two particularly useful approaches for quantitation of apparent affinity of PDZ-ligand binding are provided infra.</p>(1) A GST/PDZ fusion protein, as well as GST alone as a negative control, are bound to a surface (e.g., a 96-well plate) and the smface blocked and washed as described supra for the \"G\" assay. (2) 50 uL per well of a solution of biotinylated PL peptide (e.g. as shown in</p>TABLE 8) is added to the surface in increasing concentrations in PBS/BSA (e.g. at 0.1 uM, 0.33 uM, 1 uM, 3.3 uM, 10 uM, 33 uM, and 100 uM). In some instances, the PL peptide is allowed to react with the bound GST/PDZ fusion protein (as well as the GST alone negative \n\ncontrol) for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C followed by 20 minutes at 25\u00b0C. The plate is washed 3 times with ice cold PBS to remove unbound labeled peptide.</p>(3) The binding of the PL peptide to the immobilized PDZ-domain polypeptide is detected as described supra for the \"G\" assay. (4) For each concentration of peptide, the net binding signal is determined by subtracting the binding of the peptide to GST alone from the binding of the peptide to the GST/PDZ fusion protein. The net binding signal is then plotted as a function of ligand concentration and the plot is fit (e.g. by using the Kaleidagraph software package curve fitting algorithm; Synergy Software) to the following equation, where \"Signal<sub>[ligand]</sub>\" is the net binding signal at PL peptide concentration \"[ligand],\" \"Kd\" is the apparent affinity of the binding event, and \"Saturation Binding\" is a constant determined by the curve fitting algorithm to optimize the fit to the experimental data:</p>Signal<sub>[ligand]</sub> = Saturation Binding x ([ligand] / ([ligand] + Kd))</p>For reliable application of the above equation, it is necessary that the highest peptide ligand concentration successfully tested experimentally be greater than, or at least similar to, the calculated Kd (equivalently, the maximum observed binding should be similar to the calculated saturation binding). In cases where satisfying the above criteria proves difficult, an alternative approach (infra) can be used.</p>Approach 2:</p>(1) A fixed concentration of a PDZ-domain polypeptide and increasing concentrations of a labeled PL peptide (labeled with, for example, biotin or fluorescein, see TABLE 9 for representative peptide amino acid sequences) are mixed together in solution and allowed to react, h certain assays, peptide concentrations are 0.1 uM, 1 uM, 10 uM, 100 uM, 1 mM. In other assays, appropriate reaction times can range from 10 minutes to 2 days at temperatmes ranging from 4\u00b0C to 37\u00b0C. In some instances, the identical reaction can also be carried out using a non-PDZ domain-containing protein as a control (e.g., if the PDZ-domain polypeptide is fusion protein, the fusion partner can be used).</p>(2) PDZ-ligand complexes can be separated from unbound labeled peptide using a variety of methods known in the art. For example, the complexes can be separated using high performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC, gel filtration) (Rabinowitz \n\net al., 1998, Immunity 9:699), affinity chromatography (e.g., using glutathione Sepharose beads), and affinity absorption (e.g., by binding to an anti-GST-coated plate as described supra).</p>(3) The PDZ-ligand complex is detected based on presence of the label on the peptide ligand using a variety of methods and detectors known to one of skill in the art. For example, if the label is fluorescein and the separation is achieved using HPSEC, an in-line fluorescence detector can be used. The binding can also be detected as described supra for the</p>G assay.</p>(4) The PDZ-ligand binding signal is plotted as a function of ligand concentration and the plot is fit. (e.g., by using the Kaleidagraph software package curve fitting algorithm) to the following equation, where \"Signal<sub>[Hgand]</sub>\" is the binding signal at PL peptide concentration \"[ligand],\" \"Kd\" is the apparent affinity of the binding event, and \"Saturation Binding\" is a constant determined by the curve fitting algorithm to optimize the fit to the experimental data:</p>Signal<sub>[Ligand]</sub> = Saturation Binding x ([ligand] / ([ligand + Kd])</p>Measurement of the affinity of a labeled peptide ligand binding to a PDZ- domain polypeptide is useful because knowledge of the affinity (or apparent affinity) of this interaction allows rational design of inhibitors of the interaction with known potency. The potency of inhibitors in inhibition would be similar to (i.e., within one-order of magnitude of) the apparent affinity of the labeled peptide ligand binding to the PDZ-domain.</p>Thus, one method of determining the apparent affinity of binding between a PDZ domain and a ligand involves immobilizing a polypeptide comprising the PDZ domain and a non-PDZ domain on a smface, contacting the immobilized polypeptide with a plurality of different concentrations of the ligand, determining the amount of binding of the ligand to the immobilized polypeptide at each of the concentrations of ligand, and calculating the apparent affinity of the binding based on that data. Typically, the polypeptide comprising the PDZ domain and a non-PDZ domain is a fusion protein. In some instances, the e.g., fusion protein is GST-PDZ fusion protein, but other polypeptides can also be used (e.g., a fusion protein including a PDZ domain and any of a variety of epitope tags, biotinylation signals and the like), so long as the polypeptide can be immobilized in an orientation that does not abolish the ligand binding properties of the PDZ domain, e.g., by tethering the polypeptide to the surface via the \n\nnon-PDZ domain via an anti-domain antibody ",
    " signal of binding of P to L in the presence of the test compound plus six (6) times the standard enor of the signal in the presence of the test compound is less than the binding signal in the absence of the test compound.</p>In one approach, assays for an inhibitor are carried out using a single PDZ protein-PL protein pair (e.g., a PDZ domain fusion protein and a PL peptide). In a related approach, the assays are carried out using a plurality of pairs, such as a plurality of different pairs listed in TABLE 7 or TABLE 12.</p>In some instances, it is desirable to identify compounds that, at a given concentration, inhibit the binding of one PL-PDZ pair, but do not inhibit (or inhibit to a lesser degree) the binding of a specified second PL-PDZ pair. These antagonists can be identified by carrying out a series of assays using a candidate inhibitor and different PL-PDZ pairs (e.g., as shown in the matrix of TABLE 7 or TABLE 12) and comparing the results of the assays. All such pairwise combinations are contemplated (e.g., test compound inhibits binding of PL, to PDZ<sub>!</sub> to a greater degree than it inhibits binding of PL<sub>j</sub> to PDZ<sub>2</sub> or PL<sub>2</sub> to PDZ<sub>2</sub>). Importantly, it will be appreciated that, based on the data provided in TABLE 7 and TABLE 12 and disclosed elsehwere herein (and additional data that can be generated using the methods described herein) inhibitors with different specificities can readily be designed.</p>For example, the Ki (\"potency\") of an inhibitor of a PDZ-PL interaction can be determined. Ki is a measme of the concentration of an inhibitor required to have a biological effect. For example, administration of an inhibitor of a PDZ-PL interaction in an amount sufficient to result in an intracellular inhibitor concentration of at least between about 1 and about 100 Ki is expected to inhibit the biological response mediated by the target PDZ-PL \n\ninteraction. The Kd measmement of PDZ-PL binding as determined using the methods supra can be used in determining Ki.</p>Thus, certain methods of determining the potency (Ki) of an inhibitor or suspected inhibitor of binding between a PDZ domain and a ligand involve immobilizing a polypeptide comprising the PDZ domain and a non-PDZ domain on a surface, contacting the immobilized polypeptide with a plurality of different mixtures of the ligand and inhibitor, wherein the different mixtmes comprise a fixed amount of ligand and different concentrations of the inhibitor, determining the amount of ligand bound at the different concentrations of inhibitor, and calculating the Ki of the binding based on the amount of ligand bound in the presence of different concentrations of the inhibitor. In some instances, the polypeptide is immobilized by binding the polypeptide to an immobilized immunoglobulin that binds the non- PDZ domain. This method, which is based on the \"G\" assay described supra, is particularly suited for high-throughput analysis of the Ki for inhibitors of PDZ-ligand interactions. Further, using this method, the inhibition of the PDZ-ligand interaction itself is measured, without distortion of measmements by avidity effects.</p>Typically, at least a portion of the ligand is detectably labeled to permit easy quantitation of ligand binding.</p>It will be appreciated that the concentration of ligand and concentrations of inhibitor are selected to allow meaningful detection of inhibition. Thus, the concentration of the ligand whose binding is to be blocked is close to or less than its binding affinity (e.g., in other instances less than the 5x Kd of the interaction, in other instances less than 2x Kd, and in still other instances less than lx Kd). Thus, the ligand is typically present at a concentration of less than 2 Kd (e.g., between about 0.01 Kd and about 2 Kd) and the concentrations of the test inhibitor typically range from 1 nM to 100 uM (e.g. a 4-fold dilution series with highest concentration 10 uM or 1 mM). In a preferred embodiment, the Kd is determined using the assay disclosed supra.</p>The Ki of the binding can be calculated by any of a variety of methods routinely used in the art, based on the amount of ligand bound in the presence of different concentrations of the inhibitor. In an illustrative embodiment, for example, a plot of labeled ligand binding versus inhibitor concentration is fit to the equation:</p>S<sub>inhibitor</sub> = S<sub>0</sub>*Ki/([I]+Ki) \n\nwhere S<sub>inhibitor</sub> is the signal of labeled ligand binding to immobilized PDZ domain in the presence of inhibitor at concentration [I] and S<sub>0</sub> is the signal in the absence of inhibitor (i.e., [I] = 0). Typically [I] is expressed as a molar concentration.</p>In certain methods, an enhancer (sometimes refened to as, augmentor or agonist) of binding between a PDZ domain and a ligand is identified by immobilizing a polypeptide comprising the PDZ domain and a non-PDZ domain on a smface, contacting the immobilized polypeptide with the ligand in the presence of a test agent and determining the amount of ligand bound, and comparing the amount of ligand bound in the presence of the test agent with the amount of ligand bound by the polypeptide in the absence of the test agent. At least two-fold (often at least 5-fold) greater binding in the presence of the test agent compared to the absence of the test agent indicates that the test agent is an agent that enhances the binding of the PDZ domain to the ligand. As noted supra, agents that enhance PDZ-ligand interactions are useful for disruption (dysregulation) of biological events requiring normal PDZ-ligand function (e.g., cancer cell division and metastasis, and activation and migration of immune cells).</p>The \"potency\" or \"K^.^,.\" of an enhancer of a PDZ- ligand interaction can also be determined. For example, the K<sub>enhancer</sub> of an enhancer of a PDZ-PL interaction can be determined, e.g., using the Kd of PDZ-PL binding as determined using the methods described supra. <sup>'</sup>K<sub>e\u03b9ian\u221er</sub> is a measme of the concentration of an enhancer expected to have a biological effect. For example, administration of an enhancer of a PDZ-PL interaction in an amount sufficient to result in an intracellular inhibitor concentration of at least between about 0.1 and about 100 K<sub>enhancer</sub> (e.g., between about 0.5 and about 50 K<sub>enhancer</sub>) is expected to disrupt the biological response mediated by the target PDZ-PL interaction.</p>Thus, in one aspect the invention provides a method of determining the potency (K<sub>enhancer</sub>) of an enhancer or suspected enhancer of binding between a PDZ domain and a ligand by immobilizing a polypeptide comprising the PDZ domain and a non-PDZ domain on a surface, contacting the immobilized polypeptide with a plurality of different mixtmes of the ligand and enhancer, wherein the different mixtures comprise a fixed amount of ligand, at least a portion of which is detectably labeled, and different concentrations of the enhancer, determining the amount of ligand bound at the different concentrations of enhancer, and calculating the potency (K<sub>enhancer</sub>) of the enhancer from the binding based on the amount of ligand bound in the presence of different concentrations of the enhancer. Typically, at least a \n\nportion of the ligand is detectably labeled to permit easy quantitation of ligand binding. This method, which is based on the \"G\" assay described supra, is particularly suited for high- throughput analysis of the K<sub>enhancer</sub> for enhancers of PDZ-ligand interactions.</p>It will be appreciated that the concentration of ligand and concentrations of enhancer are selected to allow meaningful detection of enhanced binding. Thus, the ligand is typically present at a concentration of between about 0.01 Kd and about 0.5 Kd and the concentrations of the test agent/enhancer typically range from 1 nM to 1 mM (e.g. a 4-fold dilution series with highest concentration 10 uM or 1 mM). In a prefened embodiment, the Kd is determined using the assay disclosed supra. The potency of the binding can be determined by a variety of standard methods based on the amount of ligand bound in the presence of different concentrations of the enhancer or augmentor. For example, a plot of labeled ligand binding versus enhancer concentration can be fit to the equation:</p>S([E]) = S(0) + (S(0)*(D<sub>enhancer</sub>-l)*[E]/([E]+ K<sub>enhancer</sub>) where \"K<sub>enhancer</sub>\" is the potency of the augmenting compound, and \"D<sub>enhancer</sub>\" is the fold-increase in binding of the labeled ligand obtained with addition of satmating amounts of the enhancing compound, [E] is the concentration of the enhancer. It will be understood that saturating amounts are the amount of enhancer such that further addition does not significantly increase the binding signal. Knowledge of \"K<sub>enbancer</sub>\" is useful because it describes a concentration of the augmenting compound in a target cell that will result in a biological effect due to dysregulation of the PDZ-PL interaction. Typical therapeutic concentrations are between about 0.1 and about 100 K<sub>enhancer</sub>.</p>X. Identification of Pharmaceutical Compounds that Inhibit PDZ-PL Proteins For certain of the PDZ proteins and PL proteins shown to bind together and for which Kd values had been obtained, additional testing was conducted to determine whether certain pharmaceutical compounds would act to antagonize or agonize the interactions. Assays were conducted as for the G' assay described supra both in the presence and absence of test compound, except that 50 ul of a 10 uM solution of the biotinylated PL peptide is allowed to react with the surface bearing the PDZ-domain polypeptide instead of a 20 uM solution as specified in step (2) of the assay.</p>Results from such studies are shown in TABLES and 10A and 10B. In \n\nboth tables, the first column (left to right) entitled \"PDZ domain\" lists the gene name of GST-PDZ domain fusion (see TABLE 9). Entries having two numbers separated by a slash indicate which PDZ domain was utilized. For example, in TABLE 10 A, the entry for ZO-3 is 1/3. This means that PDZ domain 1 of 3 was used. The second column labeled \"PL\" indicates the name of the PDZ ligand (see</p>TABLES 10A and 10B) interacting with the PDZ domain. The third column entitled \"Drug\" lists the common or trade name of pharmaceutical compound tested and found to modulate the specific PDZ-PL interaction (suppliers and chemical information are listed in TABLE 11). The final column with the heading \"Change in OD\" indicates the change in absorbance at 450 nm of the assay in the absence (first number) or presence (second number) of chemical compomid.</p>TABLE 11 provides the generic and commercial names for the compounds tested, as well as the Sigm",
    "X is less than half the signal in the equivalent wells of the column lacking X. Thus, in this single assay one determines the full set of lymphocyte PDZs that are inhibited by compound X.</p>In some embodiments, the test compound X is a mixture of compounds, such as the product of a combinatorial chemistry synthesis as described supra. In some embodiments, the test compound is known to have a desired biological effect, and the assay is used to determine the mechanism of action (i.e., if the biological effect is due to modulating a PDZ-PL interaction).</p>It will be apparent that an agent that modulates only one, or a few PDZ-PL interactions, in a panel (e.g., a panel of all known PDZs lymphocytes, a panel of at least 10, at least 20 or at least 50 PDZ domains) is a more specific modulator than an agent that modulate many or most interactions. Typically, an agent that modulates less than 20% of PDZ domains in a panel (e.g., TABLE 7 or TABLE 12) is deemed a \"specific\" inhibitor, less than 6% a \"very specific\" inhibitor, and a single PDZ domain a \"maximally specific\" inhibitor.</p>It will also be appreciated that \"compound X\" can be a composition containing mixtme of compounds (e.g., generated using combinatorial chemistry methods) rather than a single compound.</p>Several variations of this assay can be utilized:</p>In some assays, the assay above is performed using varying concentrations of the test compound X, rather than fixed concentration. This allows determination of the Ki of the X for each PDZ as described above.</p>In other assays, instead of pairing each PDZ Pi with a specific labeled ligand Li, a mixture of different labeled ligands is created that such that for every PDZ at least one of the \n\nligands in the mixture binds to this PDZ sufficiently to detect the binding in the \"G\" assay. This mixture is then used for every PDZ domain. hi some instances, compound X is known to have a desired biological effect, but the chemical mechanism by which it has that effect is unknown. The assays of the invention can then be used to determine if compound X has its effect by binding to a PDZ domain.</p>In certain assays, PDZ-domain containing proteins are classified in to groups based on their biological function, e.g. into those that regulate chemotaxis versus those that regulate transcription. An optimal inhibitor of a particular function (e.g., including but not limited to an anti-chemotactic agent, an anti-T cell activation agent, cell-cycle control, vesicle transport, apoptosis, etc.) will inhibit multiple PDZ-ligand interactions involved in the function (e.g., chemotaxis, activation) but few other interactions. Thus, the assay is used in one embodiment in screening and design of a drug that specifically blocks a particular function. For example, an agent designed to block chemotaxis might be identified because, at a given concentration, the agent inhibits 2 or more PDZs involved in chemotaxis but fewer than 3 other PDZs, or that inhibits PDZs involved in chemotaxis with a Ki &gt; 10-fold better than for other PDZs. Thus, methods can be designed to identify an agent that inhibits a first selected PDZ-PL interaction or plurality of interactions, while not inhibiting a second selected PDZ-PL interaction or plurality of interactions. The two (or more) sets of interactions can be selected on the basis of the l\u03b1iown biological function of the PDZ proteins, the tissue specificity of the PDZ proteins, or any other criteria. Moreover, the assay can be used to determine effective doses (i.e., drug concentrations) that result in desired biological effects while avoiding undesirable effects.</p>C. Side Effects of PDZ-PL Modulator Interactions Methods can also be conducted to determine likely side effects of a therapeutic that inhibits PDZ-ligand interactions. Such methods entail identifying those target tissues, organs or cell types that express PDZ proteins and ligands that are disrupted by a specified inhibitor. If, at a therapeutic dosage, a drug intended to have an effect in one organ system (e.g., hematopoietic system) disrupts PDZ-PL interactions in a different system (e.g., CNS) it can be predicted that the drug will have effects (\"side effects\") on the second system. It will be apparent that the information obtained from this assay will be useful in the rational design and selection of drugs that do not have the side-effect. \n\n In certain methods, for example, a comprehensive PDZ protein set is obtained. A \"perfectly comprehensive\" PDZ protein set is defined as the set of all PDZ proteins expressed in the subject animal (e.g., humans). A comprehensive set can be obtained by analysis of, for example, the human genome sequence. However, a \"perfectly comprehensive\" set is not required and any reasonably large set of PDZ domain proteins (e.g., the set of all known PDZ proteins; or the set listed in TABLE 9) will provide valuable information.</p>Thus, some methods involve some of all of the following steps: a) For each PDZ protein, determine the tissues in which it is highly expressed. This can be done experimentally, although the information generally will be available in the scientific literature; b) For each PDZ protein (or as many as possible), identify the cognate PL(s) bound by the PDZ protein; c) Determine the Ki at which the test agent inhibits each PDZ-PL interaction, using the methods described supra; d) From this information it is possible to calculate the pattern of PDZ-PL interactions disrupted at various concentrations of the test agent.</p>By correlating the set of PDZ-PL interactions disrupted with the expression pattern of the members of that set, it will be possible to identify the tissues likely affected by the agent.</p>Additional steps can also be carried out, including determining whether a specified tissue or cell type is exposed to an agent following a particular route of administration. This can be determined using basis pharmacokinetic methods and principles.</p>D. Modulation of Activities</p>The PDZ binding moieties and PDZ protein -PL protein binding antagonists of the invention are used to modulate biological activities or functions of cells (e.g., hematopoietic cells, such as T cells and B cells and the like), endothelial cells, and other immune system cells, as described herein, and for treatment of diseases and conditions in human and nonhuman animals (e.g., experimental models). Exemplary biological activities are listed supra.</p>When administered to patients, the compounds identified utilizing the methods described herein (e.g., PL-PDZ interaction inhibitors) are useful for treating (ameliorating symptoms of) a variety of diseases and conditions, including diseases characterized by inflammatory and humoral immune responses, e.g., inflammation, allergy (e",
    "like), and numerous other compounds. Although, for convenience, the present discussion primarily refers \n\nantagonists of PDZ-PL interactions, it will be recognized that PDZ-PL interaction agonists can also be use in the methods disclosed herein.</p>In one aspect, the peptides and peptide mimetics or analogues of the invention contain an amino acid sequence that binds a PDZ domain in a cell of interest. In one embodiment, the antagonists comprise a peptide that has a sequence conesponding to the carboxy-terminal sequence of a PL protein listed in TABLE 8, e.g., a peptide listed TABLE 8. Typically, the peptide comprises at least the C-terminal two (3), three (3) or fom (4) residues of the PL protein, and often the inhibitory peptide comprises more than four residues (e.g., at least five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, twelve or fifteen residues) from the PL protein C- terminus.</p>In some instances, the inhibitor is a peptide, e.g., having a sequence of a PL C- te\u03c0ninal protein sequence.</p>In some embodiments, the antagonist is a fusion protein comprising such a sequence. Fusion proteins containing a transmembrane transporter amino acid sequence are particularly useful.</p>In other instances, the inhibitor is conserved variant of the PL C-terminal protein sequence having inhibitory activity.</p>In some embodiments, the antagonist is a peptide mimetic of a PL C-terminal sequence. In some embodiments, the inhibitor is a small molecule (i.e., having a molecular weight less than 1 kD).</p>F. Peptide Antagonists</p>Certain antagonists comprise a peptide that has a sequence of a PL protein carboxy-terminus listed in TABLE 8. The peptide comprises at least the C-terminal two (2) residues of the PL protein, and typically, the inhibitory peptide comprises more than two residues (e.g, at least three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, twelve or fifteen residues) from the PL protein C-terminus. The peptide can be any of a variety of lengths (e.g., at least 2, at least 3, at least 4, at least 5, at least 6, at least 8, at least 10, or at least 20 residues) and can contain additional residues not from the PL protein. It will be recognized that short PL peptides are sometime used in the rational design of other small molecules with similar properties.</p>Although most often, the residues shared by the inhibitory peptide with the PL \n\nprotein are found at the C-terminus of the peptide. However, in some embodiments, the sequence is internal. Similarly, in some cases, the inhibitory peptide comprises residues from a PL sequence that is near, but not at the c-terminus of a PL protein (see, Gee et al., 1998, J Biological Chem. 273:21980-87). Sometime the PL protein carboxy-terminus sequence is refened to as the \"core</p>PDZ motif sequence\" refe\u03c0ing to the ability of the short sequence to interact with the PDZ domain. For example, in an embodiment, the \"core PDZ motif sequence\" contains the last fom C-terminus amino acids. As described above, the four amino aci",
    "erein an amino acid is replaced with another amino acid encompassed within the same designated class. \n\n H. Peptide Mimetics</p>Having identified PDZ binding peptides and PDZ-PL interaction inhibitory sequences, peptide mimetics can be prepared using routine methods, and the inhibitory activity of the mimetics can be confirmed using the assays of the invention. Thus, certain antagonists are a peptide mimetic of a PL C-terminal sequence. The skilled artisan will recognize that individual synthetic residues and polypeptides incorporating mimetics can be synthesized using a variety of procedmes and methodologies, which are well described in the scientific and patent literature, e.g., Organic Syntheses Collective Volumes, Gilman et al. (Eds) John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., NY. Polypeptides incorporating mimetics can also be made using solid phase synthetic procedmes, as described, e.g., by Di Marchi, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,422,426. Mimetics of the invention can also be synthesized using combinatorial methodologies. Various techniques for generation of peptide and peptidomimetic libraries are well known, and include, e.g., multipin, tea bag, and split-couple-mix techniques; see, e.g., al-Obeidi (1998) Mol. Biotechnol. 9:205-223; Hruby (1997) Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1:114-119; Ostergaard (1997) Mol. Divers. 3:17-27; Ostresh (1996) Methods Enzymol. 267:220-234.</p>I. Small Molecules</p>In some embodiments, the inhibitor is a small molecule (i.e., having a molecular weight less than 1 kD). Methods for screening small molecules are well known in the art and include those described supra.</p>XII Preparation of Peptides</p>A. Chemical Synthesis</p>The peptides or analogues thereof that are described herein, can be prepared using virtually any art-known technique for the preparation of peptides and peptide analogues. For example, the peptides can be prepared in linear form using conventional solution or solid phase peptide syntheses and cleaved from the resin followed by purification procedmes</p>(Creighton, 1983, Protein Structures And Molecular Principles, W.H. Freeman and Co., N.Y.).</p>Suitable procedures for synthesizing the peptides described herein are well known in the art.</p>The composition of the synthetic peptides can be confirmed by amino acid analysis or sequencing (e.g., the Edman degradation procedure and mass spectroscopy). \n\n In addition, analogues and derivatives of the peptides can be chemically synthesized. The linkage between each amino acid of the peptides of the invention can be an amide, a substituted amide or an isostere of amide. Nonclassical amino acids or chemical amino acid analogues can be introduced as a substitution or addition into the sequence. Non- classical amino acids include, but are not limited to, the D-isomers of the common amino acids, \u03b1-amino isobutyric acid, 4-aminobutyric acid, Abu, 2-amino butyric acid, \u03b3-Abu, \u03b5-Ahx, 6-amino hexanoic acid, Aib, 2-amino isobutyric acid, 3-amino propionic acid, ornithine, norleucine",

Background</p>Binding between these molecules was assessed using a modified ELISA. Briefly, a GST-TIP-1 fusion was produced that contained the entire PDZ domain of human TIP-1 (Insert as in EXAMPLE 2). In addition, biotinylated peptides corresponding to the C-terminal 20 amino acids of Tax and CD95 were synthesized and purified by HPLC. Binding between these entities was detected through a colorimetric assay using avidin-HRP to bind the biotin and a peroxidase substrate (G-assay, as described supra). By titrating the amount of peptide and protein added to these reactions, dissociation constants (Kd) were determined as an indication of relative affinity of the peptide and fusion protein association. \n\n B. Peptide pmification</p>Peptides representing the C-terminal 8 or 20 amino acids of CD95 and Tax were synthesized by standard FMOC chemistry and biotinylated if not used as an unlabeled competitor. Peptides were purified by reverse phase high perfonnance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Vydac 218TP C18 Reversed Phase column having the dimensions of 10*25 mm, 5 um. Approximately 40 mg of peptide was dissolved in 2.0 ml of an aqueous solution of 49.9% acetonitrile and 0.1% Tri-Fluoro acetic acid (TFA). This solution was then injected into the HPLC machine through a 25 micron syringe filter (Millipore). Buffers used to get a good separation are (A) distilled water with 0.1% TFA and (B) 0.1% TFA with Acetonitrile. Gradient Segment setup is listed in TABLE 3 below.

Results of binding experiments <sup>'</sup>X</p>Results of peptides representing the carboxy-terminal 20 amino acids of Tax and CD95 binding to TLP-1 are shown in FIGURE 2A.

Determination of dissociation constants for proteins interacting with TIP-1 Using the protocol for the 'G' assay described above, dissociation constants were determined by titrating the amount of peptide against a set concentration of PDZ-containing protein. Kd values were dete\u03c0nined by identifying the peptide concentration that gave half- maximal binding to the PDZ protein. Different concentrations of PDZ-containing protein were plated in order to achieve maximal peptide binding values that were less than the absorbance maximum of the ELISA plate reader. TABLE 4 below shows the Kd values observed for the titrated reactions.</p>Table 4</p><img id=\"imgf000112_0001\" path=\"imgf000112_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/2876577/WO/20030220/A2/002003/01/43/03/imgf000112_0001.tif\"/>\n Table 4 shows the Kd values in uM for the interactions between proteins and peptides in a series of 'G-Assay' experiments. Proteins on the left are GST fusions to the PDZ domain(s) of protein indicated. Numbers in parenthesis indicate the number of PDZ domains present in the fusion constmct, from the amino-tenninus of the first number listed to the carboxyl terminus of the second. PDZ Ligands are listed across the top of the table, representing biotinylated peptides corresponding to the carboxy-terminal 20 amino acids of each protein. The first three columns following the PDZ indicate the concentration of fusion protein plated for the G assay, followed by the wavelength and time of reading from addition of TMB substrate. 450nm indicates a reaction halted by addition of sulfuric acid and absorbance read at 450 nm. Values beneath each ligand indicate first the maximum absorbance followed by the observed Kd in uM. Numbers in the squares are the average of duplicate or \n\nquadmplicate reactions. Blank squares indicate that the Kd for the interaction was not tested under those conditions on the same sample plate. No binding to GST alone is observed.</p>G. Conclusions and summary Peptides conesponding to the PL of Tax bind TIP-1 with much higher affinity than peptides corresponding to the PL of CD95. Comparing dissociation constants (.006 uM for Tax:TIP-l, 20 uM for CD95:TIP-1), one can see that Tax can bind TIP-1 &gt;3000-fold more strongly than CD95. This provides an explanation for potential oncogenicity of Tax. If TLP-l is a regulator of apoptosis tlirough binding to CD95, then upon HTLV-1 infection of lymphoid cells the Tax oncoprotein should be able to bind TLP-l and remove it's ability to associate with CD95 at meaningful levels. If CD95 mediated apoptosis requires TLP-l, then the ability of the body to activate apoptotic pathways in HTLV-1 infected cells and hence result in a cancerous condition.</p>The data presented in TABLE 4 also suggest that affinities between PDZ domains and ligands are not specific to the PDZ domain or the PL individually, but are instead specific for each unique pair. Clearly, both TIP-1 and DLG1 proteins have different dissociation constants for different ligands. Interestingly, we observe that CD95 has similar dissociation constants for both TIP-1 and DLG1. Though CD95 has similar dissociation for both pairs, Tax has different affinities for the same proteins. Hence, if a specific PL bound PDZ 'A' with 'X' Kd and PDZ 'B' with 'Y' Kd, one could not assume that another PL that bound PDZ 'A' with 'X' Kd would bind PDZ 'B' with 'Y' Kd. This shows the unique and specific nature of PDZ:PL interactions.</p>EXAMPLE 4</p>TAX and CD95 Competition for TIP-1 binding in vitro</p>The differing affinities of Tax and CD95 peptides for GST-TLP-1 suggest that competition between these two can be a mechanism for the oncogenicity of viral infection. Upon infection, the higher affinity of Tax could preferentially bind TIP-1 protein available in the cell, removing the TIP-1 bound to CD95 (Fas) and thereby rendering the cell less able to undergo apoptosis. In order to test this, competition experiments between Tax and CD95 for TLP-l binding were performed using the 'G Assay', but adding additional unlabeled competitor peptide at step 9 of the 'G Assay' presented in EXAMPLE 3 section D.</p>Il l \n\n FIGURES 2B and 2C show the results of these experiments. The graphs show the amount of binding of the biotinylated 20 amino acid peptide in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled 8 amino acid competitor. FIGURE 2B shows that 20, 100, and 500 \u03bcM Tax is able to compete for binding to TLP-l with 20 \u03bcM labeled CD95. FIGURE 2C shows that it takes 100-500 \u03bcM unlabeled CD95 peptide to compete for binding of 1 \u03bcM Tax to TIP-1. Taken together, a 5-fold excess of Tax is able to compete effectively for TLP-l binding while it takes nearly a 500-fold excess of CD95 binding to interfere with the binding of Tax to TIP-1. This provides further support for the argument that Tax has a significantly higher affinity for TLP-l than do",
    "e labeled ligand binding up to 50% (50-100-fold excess). With DLG-1, the 50uM CD95 8-mer can successfully reduce binding of CLASP-2 and CD95 labeled ligand approximately 30% at only 2.5 to 5-fold excess.</p>EXAMPLE 7 Antagonists and Agonists of PDZ/PL Interactions</p>A. Introduction</p>Many FDA approved drags have unknown mechanism of function. It is quite possible that some of these drags function by dismpting or increasing PDZ/PL interactions. \n\nThis possibility was examined by using the 'G Assay' (Example 3 section D). FDA approved drugs were incubated in the presence of the labeled peptide and compared to the same interaction without drug to determine if there was an effect on specific PDZPL interactions (drugs added with peptide at step 9 in Example 3D). The primary focus of this experiment was on drags involved in treatment of depression (amitriptyline, desipramine, trimipramine, benztropine, and nortryptilline) and epilepsy (valproic acid). No modes of action are known for these drags.</p>The FDA approved drags used in this study are listed in TABLE 11. Therapeutic dose was determined by guidelines given in the Physician's Desk Reference and in the assay, 200 times this amount was used. If a dosage range was given, the upper end of the range was used. Each interaction listed in TABLES 10A &amp; B was tested in the 'G Assay' (see Example 3) against each of the drags listed in TABLE 11. The concentration of GST- fusion protein and peptide used in the assay represent the Kd and were determined by titration. These values can be found in TABLE 7. The drags were added to the peptide before addition to the well containing the PDZ protein. Otherwise, the assay was carried out as described and read at 450nm after 30 minutes of developing. For the sequences of the PDZs and PLs used in these tests, see TABLES 8 &amp; 9.</p>B. Results</p>As can be seen in TABLE 10A, agonist effects can be seen up to 4.3 fold higher than in the absence of drug, as in the case of AF6 and presenilin-1 in the presence of amitriptyline. Antagonistic effects have been demostrated here up to 4.2 fold higher, as in the cases of ZO-2 domain 1 and DNAM-1 in the presence of desipramine or nortryptilline and examples are listed in TABLE 10B.</p>Many agonist and antagonist effects can be seen when the drags are incubated with PDZ/PL interactions. These results seem quite reasonable as the antidepressants used are from the tricyclic class and predominantly affect interactions where the peptide is known to function predominantly in the brain, e.g., presenilin 1 &amp; 2 and norepinephrine transporter (NET). These results suggest that small molecules and therapeutic compounds can be used to modulate the binding between PDZ domains and their ligands. \n\n Table 10A</p>Agonists 010726</p><img id=\"imgf000121_0001\" path=\"imgf000121_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/2876598/WO/20030220/A2/002003/01/43/03/imgf000121_0001.tif\"/></p>Table 10B</p>Antagonists 010726</p>"
