Prions may be deposited in the environment through the remains of dead animals and via urine, saliva, and other body fluids (e.g. in the case of CWD) (HALEY et al., \u201cDetection of CWD prions in urine and saliva of deer by transgenic mouse bioassay,\u201d PLoS ONE, 2009, Vol. 4, p. 4848, Epub., 2009 Mar. 18). They may then linger in the soil by binding to clay and other minerals (SAUNDERS et al., Prions in the environment: occurrence, fate and mitigation. Prion. 2008 Vol. 2:162-9. Epub 2008 Oct. 26. Review.). Other methods of infection are also known.</p>Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein associated protein 1, also known as LRPAP1 or Receptor-Associated Protein (RAP), is encoded in humans by the LRPAP1 gene (STRICKLAND et al., \u201cPrimary structure of alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor-associated protein. Human homologue of a Heymann nephritis antigen\u201d. J. Biol. Chem., 1991 Vol. 266, pp. 13364-9. KORENBERG et al., \u201cChromosomal localization of human genes for the LDL receptor family member glycoprotein 330 (LRP2) and its associated protein RAP (LRPAP1)\u201d. Genomics 1994, Vol. 22, pp. 88-93. The protein was first isolated from mice as a 44-kD heparin-binding protein and was initially termed HBP-44 (FURUKAWA et al., \u201cA heparin binding protein whose expression increases during differentiation of embryonal carcinoma cells to parietal endoderm cells: cDNA cloning and sequence analysis,\u201d J. Biochem., 1990, Vol. 108, No. 2, pp. 297-302). In humans a 39-kD associated protein was purified as a part of the alpha-2-macroglobulin receptor complex (ASHCOM et al., \u201cThe human alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor: identification of a 420-kD cell surface glycoprotein specific for the activated conformation of alpha 2-macroglobulin,\u201d J. Cell. Biol., 1990, Vol. 110, pp. 1041-8; STRICKLAND et al., \u201cPrimary structure of alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor-associated protein. Human homologue of a Heymann nephritis antigen,\u201d J Biol Chem., 1991, Vol. 266, pp. 13364-9. The primary structure of the 39-kD polypeptide, termed alpha-2-macroglobulin receptor-associated protein (\u03b1<sub>2</sub>MRAP), was determined by cDNA cloning (STRICKLAND et al., \u201cPrimary structure of alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor-associated protein. Human homologue of a Heymann nephritis antigen,\u201d J Biol Chem., 1991, Vol. 266, pp. 13364-9). Functional studies revealed that RAP blocked ligand binding by LRP1 (HERZ et al., \u201c39-kDa protein modulates binding of ligands to low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein/alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor,\u201d J. Biol. Chem., 1991, Vol. 266, pp. 21232-8; WILLIAMS et al., \u201cA novel mechanism for controlling the activity of alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein. Multiple regulatory sites for 39-kDa receptor-associated protein,\u201d Biol Chem., 1992, Vol. 267, pp. 9035-40). The deduced amino acid sequence of human RAP contains a putative signal sequence that precedes the 323-residue mature protein. The sequence showed 73% identity with a rat protein and 77% identity to a 44-kD mouse HBP-44. There are also similarities between RAP and apolipoprotein E. RAP is localized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum where it binds to LDL-receptor related proteins functioning as a specialized chaperone assisting in the folding and intracellular transport of members of the LDL receptor family. RAP is expressed in various organs and tissues throughout the body, including the brain. Experimental evidence suggests that RAP acts as a receptor antagonist and prevents association of newly synthesized LDL-receptor related proteins with their ligands during transport to the cell surface (WILLNOW, \u201cReceptor-associated protein (RAP): a specialized chaperone for endocytic receptors,\u201d Biol Chem., 1998, Vol. 379, pp. 1025-31). RAP is efficiently transferred across the blood-brain barrier and may provide a means of protein-based drug delivery to the brain (PAN et al., \u201cEfficient transfer of receptor-associated protein (RAP) across the blood-brain barrier,\u201d J Cell Sci., 2004, Vol. 117(Pt 21), pp. 5071-8, Epub., 2004 Sep. 21). Recently, the importance of RAP has been shown in amyloid depositions in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (XU et al. \u201cReceptor-associated protein (RAP) plays a central role in modulating Abeta deposition in APP/PS 1 transgenic mice,\u201d PLoS ONE, 2008, Vol. 3, p. 3159). RAP also inhibited beta-amyloid protein (Abeta)oligomerization, neurotoxic effects of Abeta in cell cultures and blocked an Abeta-induced inhibition of long-term memory consolidation in "
