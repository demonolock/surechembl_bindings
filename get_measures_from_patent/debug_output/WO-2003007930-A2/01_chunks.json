No. WO 00/59874.</p>[7] As noted above, matrix metalloproteases are also implicated in pathological conditions associated with excessive degradation of connective tissue. Matrix metalloproteinases, a family of zinc-dependent proteinases, make up a major class of enzymes involved in degrading connective tissue. Matrix metalloproteinases are divided into classes, with some members having several different names in common use. Examples are: MMP-1 (also known as collagenase 1, fibroblast collagenase, or EC 3.4.24.3); MMP-2 (also known as gelatinase A, 72kDa gelatinase, basement membrane collagenase, or EC 3.4.24.24), MMP-3 (also known as stromelysin 1 or EC 3.4.24.17), proteoglycanase, MMP-7 (also known as matrilysin), MMP-8 (also known as collagenase II, neutrophil collagenase, or EC 3.4.24.34), MMP-9 (also known as \n\ngelatinase B, 92kDa gelatinase, or EC 3.4.24.35), MMP-10 (also known as stromelysin 2 or EC 3.4.24.22), MMP-1 1 (also known as stromelysin 3), MMP-12 (also known as metalloelastase, human macrophage elastase or HME), MMP- 13 (also known as collagenase 111), and MMP- 14 (also known as MT1-MMP or membrane MMP). See, generally, Woessner, J.F., \"The Matrix Metalloprotease Family\" in Matrix Metalloproteinases, pp.1-14 (Edited by Parks, W.C. &amp; Mecham, R.P., Academic Press, San Diego, CA 1998).</p>[8] Excessive breakdown of connective tissue by MMPs is a feature of many pathological conditions. Inhibition of MMPs therefore provides a control mechanism for tissue decomposition to prevent and/or treat these pathological conditions. Such pathological conditions generally include, for example, tissue destruction, fibrotic diseases, pathological matrix weakening, defective injury repair, cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary diseases, kidney diseases, liver diseases, bone diseases, and diseases of the central nervous system. Specific examples of such conditions include, for example, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, septic arthritis, multiple sclerosis, a decubitis ulcer, corneal ulceration, epidermal ulceration, gastric ulceration, tumor metastasis, tumor invasion, tumor angiogenesis, periodontal disease, liver cirrhosis, fibrotic lung disease, emphysema, otosclerosis, atherosclerosis, proteinuria, coronary thrombosis, dilated cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, aortic aneurysm, epidermolysis bullosa, bone disease, Alzheimer's disease, and defective injury repair (e.g., weak repairs, adhesions such as post-surgical adhesions, and scarring).</p>[9] Matrix metalloproteinases also are involved in the biosynthesis of tumor necrosis factors (TNFs). Tumor necrosis factors are implicated in many pathological conditions. TNF-\u03b1, for example, is a cytokine that is presently thought to be produced initially as a 28 kD cell-associated molecule. It is released as an active, 17 kD form that can mediate a large number of deleterious effects in vitro and in vivo. TNF-\u03b1 can cause and/or contribute to the effects of inflammation (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), autoimmune disease, graft rejection, multiple sclerosis, fibrotic diseases, cancer, infectious diseases (e.g., malaria, mycobacterial infection, meningitis, etc.), fever, psoriasis, cardiovascular diseases (e.g., post-ischemic reperfusion injury and congestive heart failure), pulmonary diseases, hemorrhage, coagulation, hyperoxic alveolar injury, radiation damage, and acute phase \n\nresponses like those seen with infections and sepsis and during shock (e.g., septic shock and hemodynamic shock). Chronic release of active TNF-\u03b1 can cause cachexia and anorexia. TNF-\u03b1 also can be lethal.</p>[10] Inhibiting TNF (and related compounds) production and action is an important clinical disease treatment. Matrix metalloproteinase inhibition is one mechanism that can be used. MMP inhibitors (e.g., inhibitors of collagenase, stromelysin, and gelatinase), for example, have been reported to inhibit TNF-\u03b1 release. See, e.g., Gearing et al. Nature, 376, 555-557 (1994). See also, McGeehan et al. See also, Nature 376, 558-561 (1994). MMP inhibitors also have been reported to inhibit TNF-\u03b1 convertase, a metalloproteinase involved in forming active TNF-\u03b1. See, e.g., WIPO Int'l Pub. No. WO 94/24140. See also, WIPO Int'l Pub. No. WO 94/02466. See also, WIPO Int'l Pub. No. WO 97/20824.</p>[11] Matrix metalloproteinases also are involved in other biochemical processes in mammals. These include control of ovulation, post-partum uterine involution, possibly implantation, cleavage of APP (\u03b2-amyloid precursor protein) to the ainyloid plaque, and inactivation of (\u03b1i-protease inhibitor (\u03b1<sub>!</sub> -PI). Inhibiting MMPs therefore may be, for example, a mechanism to control of fertility. In addition, increasing and maintaining the levels of an endogenous or administered serine protease inhibitor (e.g., \u03b1j-PI) supports the treatment and prevention of pathological conditions such as emphysema, pulmonary diseases, inflammatory diseases, and diseases of aging (e.g., loss of skin or organ stretch and resiliency).</p>[12] Numerous metalloproteinase inhibitors are known. See, generally, Brown, P.D., \"Synthetic Inhibitors of Matrix Metalloproteinases,\" in Matrix Metalloproteinases, pp. 243-61 (Edited by Parks, W.C. &amp; Mecham",

See also, Rasmussen et al., PharmacoL Ther., 75(1): 69-75 (1997). See also, Denis et al., Invest New Drugs, 15(3): 175-185 (1997). Sulfamato hydroxamates have additionally been reported to inhibit MMPs. See, WIPO Int'l Pub. No. WO 00/46221. And various aromatic sulfone hydroxamates have been reported to inhibit MMPs. See, WIPO Int'l Pub. No. WO 99/25687. See also, WIPO Int'l Pub. No. WO 00/50396. See also, WIPO Int'l Pub. No. WO 00/69821. See also, WIPO Int'l Pub. No. WO 98/38859 (disclosing, for example, sulfonyl aryl or heteroaryl hydroxamates). See also, WIPO Int'l Publ. No. WO 00/69819 (same).</p>[17] It is often advantageous for an MMP inhibitor drug to target a certain MMP(s) over another MMP(s). For example, it is typically preferred to inhibit MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, and/or MMP-13 (particularly MMP-13) when treating and/or preventing cancer, inhibiting of metastasis, and inhibiting angiogenesis. It also is typically preferred to inhibit MMP-13 when preventing and or treating osteoarthritis. See, e.g., Mitchell et al., J Clin. Invest., 97:761-768 (1996). See also, Reboul et al., J Clin. Invest., 97:2011-2019 (1996). Normally, however, it is preferred to use a drug that has little or no inhibitory effect on MMP-1 and MMP-14. This preference stems from the fact that both MMP-1 and \n\nMMP- 14 are involved in several homeostatic processes, and inhibition of MMP-1 and/or MMP- 14 consequently tends to interfere with such processes.</p>[18] Many known MMP inhibitors exhibit the same or similar inhibitory effects against each of the MMPs. For example, batimastat (a peptidomimetic hydroxamate) has been reported to exhibit IC<sub>50</sub> values of from about 1 to about 20 nM against each of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-9. Marimastat (another peptidomimetic hydroxamate) has been reported to be another broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor with an enzyme inhibitory spectrum similar to batimastat, except that Marimastat reportedly exhibited an IC5<sub>0</sub> value against MMP-3 of 230 nM. See Rasmussen et al., Pharmacol. Ther., 75(1): 69-75 (1997).</p>[19] Meta analysis of data from Phase I II studies using Marimastat in patients with advanced, rapidly progressive, treatment-refractory solid tumor cancers (colorectal, pancreatic, ovarian, and prostate) indicated a dose-related reduction in the rise of cancer-specific antigens used as surrogate markers for biological activity. Although Marimastat exhibited some measure of efficacy via these markers, toxic side effects reportedly were observed. The most common drug-related toxicity of Marimastat in those clinical trials was musculoskeletal pain and stiffness, often commencing in the small joints in the hands, and then spreading to the arms and shoulder. A short dosing holiday of 1-3 weeks followed by dosage reduction reportedly permits treatment to continue. See Rasmussen et al., Pharmacol. Ther., 75(1): 69-75 (1997). It is thought that the lack of specificity of inhibitory effect among the MMPs may be the cause of that effect.</p>[20] In view of the importance of hydroxamate aggrecanase inhibitors in the prevention or treatment of pathological conditions and the lack of MMP specificity exhibited by at least some hydroxamates that have been in clinical trials, there continues to be a need for a method of preventing or treating a condition associated with aggrecanase activity using a hydroxamate or derivative thereof, while causing little or no inhibition of without excessively inhibiting MMPs (particularly MMP-1 and MMP-14) essential to normal bodily function (e.g., tissue turnover and repair). The following disclosure describes a method for addressing such a need. \n\n SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [21] This invention is directed to a method for inhibiting aggrecanase activity (particularly pathological activity), while causing relatively little or no inhibition against MMP activity essential to normal bodily function (particularly MMP-1 and MMP-14 activity). This method is typically used with mammals, such as humans, other primates (e.g., monkeys, chimpanzees, etc.), companion animals (e.g., dogs, cats, horses, etc.), farm animals (e.g., goats, sheep, pigs, cattle, etc.), laboratory animals (e.g., mice, rats, etc.), and wild and zoo animals (e.g., wolves, bears, deer, etc.).</p>[22] Briefly, therefore, this invention is directed, in part, to a process for preventing or treating a condition associated with aggrecanase activity in a host animal. Such a condition may be, for example, an inflammatory disease or cancer. The process comprises administering a compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to the host animal in an amount effective to prevent or treat the condition.</p>[23] In one embodiment, the compound corresponds in structure to Formula A:</p><img id=\"imgf000008_0001\" path=\"imgf000008_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/2852888/WO/20030130/A2/002003/00/79/30/imgf000008_0001.tif\"/></p>In this embodiment:</p>W is a 5- or 6-member aromatic or heteroaromatic ring.</p>X is -CH<sub>2</sub>- or -N(R<sup>9</sup>)- Here, R<sup>9</sup> is hydrogen, aryl, alkyl, or arylalkyl. y and z are each zero or one and the sum of x and y is either zero or one.</p>R<sup>1</sup> is a substituent that contains a 5- or 6-member a cyclohydrocarbyl, heterocyclo, aryl, or heteroaryl bonded directly to the de",
    "ain, or by building models using commercially available kits whose bond angles, lengths, and atomic radii are in accord with accepted, published values. R<sup>1</sup> substituent lengths also can be determined somewhat less exactly by presuming, as is done here, that all atoms have bond lengths of saturated carbon, that unsaturated and aromatic bonds have the same lengths as saturated bonds, and that bond angles for unsaturated bonds are the same as those for saturated bonds, although the above-mentioned modes of measurement are preferred. To illustrate, a 4-phenyl or 4-pyridyl group has a length of a four carbon chain, as does a propoxy group. A biphenyl group, on the other hand, has a length of about an 8-carbon chain. Because a single-ring or fused-ring system cyclohydrocarbyl, heterocyclo, aryl, or heteroaryl is generally not itself long enough to fulfill the length requirement for a preferred compound (particularly where R<sup>1</sup> is -N(R<sup>7</sup>)(R<sup>8</sup>)), the R<sup>1</sup> cyclohydrocarbyl, heterocyclo, aryl, or heteroaryl bonded to directly to the sulfonyl is preferably itself substituted.</p>[54] The length of R<sup>1</sup> is believed to play a role in the overall activity of a contemplated inhibitor compound against MMP enzymes generally. Specifically, a compound containing an R<sup>1</sup> substituent with a length of about a heptyl chain or longer (e.g., 4-phenoxyphenyl, which has a length of about a 9-carbon chain), typically exhibit little or no inhibition against MMP-1. In addition, compounds containing an R substituent with a length of about an heptyl chain or longer typically exhibit good to excellent potencies against MMP-13 and/or MMP-2. Exemplary data are provided in the Inhibition Tables hereinafter.</p>[55] In addition to the preferred length, an R<sup>1</sup> substituent also has a preferred rotational width. More specifically, an R<sup>1</sup> substituent containing a 6- member ring bonded directly to the depicted SO<sub>2</sub> group preferably has geometric dimensions such that if the R<sup>1</sup> substituent were to be rotated about an axis drawn through the SO -bonded 1-position and the 4-position of the SO<sub>2</sub>-bonded R<sup>1</sup> ring, the 3-dimensional volume defined by the rotation would have a widest dimension in a direction transverse to the axis of rotation of from about that of a furanyl ring \n\nto about that of 2 phenyl rings. Likewise, an R<sup>1</sup> substituent containing a 5-member ring bonded directly to the depicted SO<sub>2</sub> group preferably has geometric dimensions such that if the R<sup>1</sup> substituent were to be rotated about an axis drawn through the SO<sub>2</sub>-bonded 1 -position and the center of the 3,4-bond of the SO<sub>2</sub>- bonded R<sup>1</sup> ring, the 3-dimensional volume defined by the rotation would have a widest dimension in a direction transverse to the axis of rotation of from about that of a furanyl ring to about that of 2 phenyl rings. In this context, a fused ring system (e.g., naphthyl or purinyl) is considered to be a 6- or 5 member ring that is substituted at appropriate positions numbered from the SO -linkage that is deemed to be at the 1 -position. Thus, a 2-naphthyl s",

These enzymes were prepared in the Assignee's laboratories following usual laboratory procedures.

See, e.g., Enzyme Nomenclature (Academic Press, San Diego, CA, 1992) (and the citations therein). See also, Frije et al., J Biol.

[407] The enzyme substrate was a methoxycoumarin-containing polypeptide having the following sequence:</p>MCA-ProLeuGlyLeuDpaAlaArgNH<sub>2</sub></p>Here, \"MCA\" is methoxycoumarin and \"Dpa\" is 3-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-2,3- diaminopropionyl alanine. This substrate is commercially available from Baychem (Redwood City, CA) as product M-1895.</p>[408] The subject hydroxamate (or salt thereof) was dissolved at various concentrations using 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in a buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCI, 10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.05% polyethyleneglycol (23) lauryl ether at a pH of 7.5. These solutions were then compared to a control (which contained an equal amount of DMSO/buffer solution, but no hydroxamate compound) using Microfluor\u2122 White Plates (Dynatech, Chantilly, VA). More specifically, the MMPs were activated with APMA or trypsin. Then the various hydroxamate/DMSO/buffer solutions and control solutions were introduced into separate plates at room temperature with the activated MMP. After 10 minutes, 4 um of the MMP substrate was added to each plate. The plates were then incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. In the absence of inhibitor activity, a fluorogenic peptide was cleaved at the gly-leu peptide bond of the substrate, separating the highly fluorogenic peptide from a 2,4-dinitrophenyl quencher, resulting in an increase of fluorescent intensity (excitation at 328 nm/emission at 415). Inhibition was measured as a reduction in fluorescent intensity as a function of inhibitor concentration using a Perkin Elmer (Norwalk, CT) L550 plate reader.

The corneal micropocket assay provides such a model of angiogenesis in the cornea of a mouse. See, Kenyon, BM, et al., \"A Model of Angiogenesis in the Mouse Cornea,\" Investigative Ophthalmology &amp; Visual Science, Vol. 37, No. 8 (July 1996).</p>[411] In this assay, uniformly sized Hydron\u2122 pellets containing BFGF and sucralfate are prepared and surgically implanted into the stroma mouse corneal adjacent to the temporal limbus. The pellets are formed by making a suspension of 20 \u03bcL sterile saline containing 10 \u03bcg recombinant bFGF, 10 mg of sucralfate and 10 \u03bcL of 12% Hydron\u2122 in ethanol. The slurry is then deposited on a 10 x 10 mm piece of sterile nylon mesh. After drying, the nylon fibers of the mesh are separated to release the pellets.</p>[412] The corneal pocket is made by anesthetizing a 7 week old C57B1/6 female mouse, then proptosing the eye with a jeweler's forceps. Using a dissecting microscope, a central, intrastromal linear keratotomy of approximately 0.6 mm in length is performed with a #15 surgical blade, parallel to the insertion of the lateral rectus muscle. Using a modified cataract knife, a lamellar micropocket is dissected toward the temporal limbus. The pocket is extended to within 1.0 mm of the temporal limbus. A single pellet is placed on the corneal surface at the base of the pocket with a jeweler's forceps. The pellet is then advanced to the temporal end of the pocket. Antibiotic ointment is then applied to the eye.</p>[413] Mice are dosed on a daily basis for the duration of the assay. Dosing of the animals is based on bioavailability and overall potency of the compound. An \n\nexemplary dose is 50 mg/kg bid, po. Neovascularization of the corneal stroma begins at about day 3, and is permitted to continue under the influence of the assayed compound until day 5. At day 5, the degree of angiogenic inhibition is scored by viewing the neovascular progression with a slit lamp microscope. [414] The mice are anesthetized and the studied eye is once again proposed. The maximum vessel length of neovascularization, extending from the limbal vascular plexus toward the pellet is measured. In addition, the contiguous circumferential zone of neovascularization is measured as clock hr, where 30 degrees of arc equals 1 clock hr. The area of angiogenesis is calculated as follows.</p>area (0.4 x clock hrx 3.14 x vessel lensth (in mm))</p>2 [415] The studied mice are thereafter compared to control mice and the difference in the area of neovascularization is recorded. A contemplated compound typically exhibits about from 25% to about 75% inhibition, whereas the vehicle control exhibits 0% inhibition.</p>[416] Examples 62: In Vitro Aggrecanase Inhibition [417] Assays for measuring the potency (IC<sub>50</sub>) of a compound toward inhibiting aggrecanase are known in the art.</p>[418] One such assay, for example, has been reported in European Patent Application Publ. No. EP 1 081 137 Al . In that assay, primary porcine chondrocytes from articular joint cartilage are isolated by sequential trypsin and collagenase digestion followed by collagenase digestion overnight and are plated at 2xl0<sup>5</sup> cells per well into 48 well plates with 5 \u03bcCi/ml<sup>35</sup>S (1000 Ci/mmol) sulphur in type 1 collagen coated plates. Cells are allowed to incorporate label into their proteoglycan matrix (approximately 1 week) at 37\u00b0C under an atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The night before initiating the assay, chondrocyte monolayers are washed 2 times in DMEM/1% PSF/G and then allowed to incubate in fresh DMEM/1% FBS overnight. The next morning, chondrocytes are washed once in DMEM/1% PSF/G. The final wash is allowed to sit on the plates in the incubator while making dilutions. Media and dilutions are made as described in the following Table C: \n\n Table C</p><img id=\"imgf000253_0001\" path=\"imgf000253_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/2852965/WO/20030130/A2/002003/00/79/30/imgf000253_0001.tif\"/></p>Plates are labeled and only the interior 24 wells of the plate are used. On one of the plates, several columns are designated as IL-1 (no drug) and control (no IL-1, no drug). These control columns are periodically counted to monitor 35S- proteoglycan release. Control and IL-1 media are added to wells (450 \u03bcL) followed by compound (50 \u03bcL) so as to initiate the assay. Plates are incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. At 40-50% release (when CPM from EL-1 media is 4-5 times control media) as assessed by liquid scintillation counting (LSC) of media samples, the assay is terminated (about 9 to about 12 hours). Media is removed from all wells and placed into scintillation tubes. Scintillate is added and radioactive counts are acquired (LSC). To solubilize cell layers, 500 \u03bcL of papain digestion buffer (0.2 M Tris, pH 7.0, 5 mM DTT, and 1 mg/ml papain) is added to each well. Plates with digestion solution are incubated at 60\u00b0C overnight. The cell layer is removed from the plates the next day and placed in scintillation tubes. Scintillate is then added, and samples counted (LSC). The percent of released counts from the total present in each well is determined. Averages of the triplicates are made with control background subtracted from each well. The percent of compound inhibition is based on B -1 samples as 0% inhibition (100% of total counts). \n\n [419] Another assay for measuring aggrecanase inhibition has been reported in WIPO Int'l Publ. No. WO 00/59874. That assay reportedly uses active aggrecanase accumulated in media from stimulated bovine cartilage (BNC) or related cartilage sources and purified cartilage aggrecan monomer or a fragment thereof as a substrate. Aggrecanase is generated by stimulation of cartilage slices with interleukin-1 (EL-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), or other stimuli. To accumulate BNC aggrecanase in culture media, cartilage reportedly is first depleted of endogenous aggrecan by stimulation with 500 ng/ml human recombinant DL-\u03b2 for 6 days with media changes every 2 days. Cartilage is then stimulated for an additional 8 days without media change to allow accumulation of soluble, active aggrecanase in the culture media. To decrease the amounts of matrix metalloproteinases released into the media during aggrecanase accumulation, agents which inhibit MMP-1, -2, -3, and -9 biosynthesis are included during stimulation. This BNC conditioned media containing aggrecanase activity is then used as the source of aggrecanase for the assay. Aggrecanase enzymatic activity is detected by monitoring production of aggrecan fragments produced exclusively by cleavage at the Glu373-Ala374 bond within the aggrecan core protein by Western analysis using the monoclonal antibody, BC-3 (Hughes, et al., Biochem J, 306:799-804 (1995)). This antibody reportedly recognizes aggrecan fragments with the N-terminus, 374ARGSVIL, generated upon cleavage by aggrecanase. The BC-3 antibody reportedly recognizes this neoepitope only when it is at the N-terminus and not when it is present internally within aggrecan fragments or within the aggrecan protein core. Only products produced upon cleavage by aggrecanase reportedly are detected. Kinetic studies using this assay reportedly yield a Km of 1.5+/-0.35 \u03bcM for aggrecanase. To evaluate inhibition of aggrecanase, compounds are prepared as 10 mM stocks in DMSO, water, or other solvents and diluted to appropriate concentrations in water. Drug (50 \u03bcL) is added to 50 \u03bcL of aggrecanase-containing media and 50 \u03bcL of 2 mg/ml aggrecan substrate and brought to a final volume of 200 \u03bcL in 0.2 M Tris, pH 7.6, containing 0.4 M NaCI and 40 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. The assay is run for 4 hr at 37\u00b0C, quenched with 20 mM EDTA, and analyzed for aggrecanase-generated products. A sample containing enzyme and substrate without drug is included as a positive control and enzyme incubated in the absence of substrate serves as a measure of background. Removal of the glycosaminoglycan side chains from aggrecan reportedly is \n\nnecessary for the BC-3 antibody to recognize the ARGSVIL epitope on the core protein. Therefore, for analysis of aggrecan fragments generated by cleavage at the Glu373-Ala374 site, proteoglycans and proteoglycan fragments are enzymatically deglycosylated with chondroitinase ABC (0.1 units/10 \u03bcg GAG) for 2 hr at 37\u00b0C and then with keratanase (0.1 units/10 \u03bcg GAG) and keratanase II (0.002 units/10 \u03bcg GAG) for 2 hr at 37\u00b0C in buffer containing 50 mM sodium acetate, 0.1 M Tris/HCl, pH 6.5. After digestion, aggrecan in the samples is precipitated with 5 volumes of acetone and resuspended in 30 \u03bcL of Tris glycine SDS sample buffer (Novex) containing 2.5% beta mercaptoethanol. Samples are loaded and then separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions with 4-12% gradient gels, transferred to nitrocellulose and immunolocated with 1:500 dilution of antibody BC3. Subsequently, membranes are incubated with a 1:5000 dilution of goat anti- mouse IgG alkaline phosphatase second antibody and aggrecan catabolites visualized by incubation with appropriate substrate for 10-30 minutes to achieve optimal color development. Blots are quantitated by scanning densitometry and inhibition of aggrecanase determined by comparing the amount of product produced in the presence versus absence of compound.</p>[420] The above detailed description of preferred embodiments is intended only to acquaint others skilled in the art with the invention, its principles, and its practical application so that others skilled in the art may adapt and apply the invention in its numerous forms, as they may be best suited to the requirements of a particular use.
