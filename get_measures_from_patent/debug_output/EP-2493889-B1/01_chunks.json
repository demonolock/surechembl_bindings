    "ose 6FF . Tested compounds were dissolved and diluted in 100% DMSO to a concentration 100 fold of the final concentration in the assay. Compound dilutions (0.4 \u00b5l) were added in 384 well plates to 20 \u00b5l of incubation buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.8, 8.3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.7 mM EGTA). 10\u00b5l of rPDE10A enzyme in incubation buffer was added and the reaction was started by addition of 10 \u00b5l substrate to a final concentration of 60 nM cAMP and 0.008 \u00b5Ci <sup>3</sup>H-cAMP. The reaction was incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature. After incubation, the reaction was stopped with 20 \u00b5l of of stop solution consisting of 17.8 mg/ml PDE SPA (scintillation proximity assay) beads. After sedimentation of the beads during 30 minutes the radioactivity was measured in a Perkin Elmer Topcount scintillation counter and results were expressed as cpm. For blanc values the enzyme was omitted from the reaction and replaced by incubation buffer. Control values were obtained by addition of a final concentration of 1% DMSO instead of compound. The same assay principle is applied for the measurement of the affinity of the compound for other members of the PDE family with appropriate modifications in incubation buffer, substrate concentration, incubation time and stop solution. An overview of the different protocols is presented in table A. A best fit curve is fitted by a minimum sum of squares method to the plot of % of control value substracted with blanc value versus compound concentration and the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) value is derived from this curve.\nTable A: Assay conditions for the Measurement of Phosphodiesterase activity by SPAEnzymeIncubation BufferFinal Concentration Substrate<sup>3</sup>H Substrate \u00b5Ci/wellStop SolutionIncubation Time (min)hPDE1B1B*1 \u00b5M cAMP0.0161*30hPDE2AA*10 \u00b5M cGMP0.012*40hPDE3AA*0.1 \u00b5M cAMP0.0242*60hPDE4D3A*1 \u00b5M cAMP0.0081*60hPDE5A3A*1 \u00b5M cGMP0.012*60hPDE6ABA*0.1 \u00b5M cGMP0.012*120hPDE7A1A*60 nM cAMP0.0081*60hPDE8A1A*0.3 \u00b5M cAMP0.011*60hPDE9AC*60 nM cGMP0.0082*60rPDE10A2A*60 nM cAMP0.0081*60hPDE11A4A*0.3 \u00b5M cGMP0.011*30A* 50 mM Tris pH7.8, 1.7 mM EGTA, 8.3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>\nB* 50 mM Tris pH7.8, 8.3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>\nC* 50 mM Tris pH7.8, 5 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>\n1* 17.8 mg/ml PDE beads\n2* 17.8 mg/ml PDE beads + 200 mM ZnCl<sub>2</sub></p>The compounds of the invention are generally selective for PDE10 compared to other PDEs and there are a few that also have affinity for PDE1B1, 4D3 and 5A3. Table 4 provides data of some compounds according to the invention.</p>Apomorphine-induced Stereotypy in Rats (APO)Apomorphine (1.0 mg/kg, i.v.)-induced stereotypy (compulsive sniffing, licking, chewing) was scored every 5 min over the first hour after injection of apomorphine, following a 1 hour interval pre-treatment with the test compound. The score system was: (3) pronounced, (2) moderate, (1) slight, and (0) absent.Criteria for drug-induced inhibition of stereotypy: fewer than 6 scores of 3 (0.16% false positives), "
