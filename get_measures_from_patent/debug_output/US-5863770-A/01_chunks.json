    "nt.</p>The pBluescript\u00ae vector from Stratagene was used as the basis propagation vector. The 5' end of the full-length cDNA in this vector was derived from cDNA clone 10-1 (between the PstI and XbaI sites). The resulting clones were named pBQ4.7 and pBQ6.2 (FIG. 8).</p>The plasmid pSGM3X was used as the basic mammalian expression vector. It is similar to pSGM1 previously reported by Meakin et al (1987), except that the human metallothionein promoter was inserted in an opposite orientation and that a XhoI site was inserted in the KpnI site within the Ecogpt gene. The resulting expression vector was named pCOF-1 (FIG. 5).</p>Sequence Verification</p>Since errors are often introduced into PCR products due to infidelity of the Taq polymerase, the middle segment of the cDNA clones were first verified by DNA sequencing. The procedure of dideoxy termination was used according to the US Biochemical Sequenase\u00ae kit. Consequently, it was necessary to replace a small segment (the XbaI site in exon 6 to the FspI site in exon 7) of the clone with the corresponding segment from T1601. Overlapping DNA sequencing was then performed for the entire open reading frame of each of the completed full-length cDNA constructs.</p>In vitro Translation</p>To produce large quantities of RNA from the propagation vector (pBQ4.7 and pBQ6.2) for the purpose of in vitro translation, the mCAP\u00ae mRNA capping kit from Stratagene was used.</p>Since the open reading frame predicts a protein of 170,999 kilodaltons (kd), it would be difficult to produce a product of this size in vitro. It was therefore necessary to use differently prepared templates to examine various segments of the open reading frame. To prepare these templates, the propagation vector pBQ6.2) was digested with FspI, EcoRI, HpaI and XhoI, accordingly.</p>In vitro translation was performed with a rabbit reticulocyte lysate kit from Promega Corporation and <sup>14</sup> C-labelled leucine from Amersham.</p>Transfection Studies in Mouse LTX Cells</p>The calcium phosphate co-precipitation procedure for introduction of plasmid DNA into mouse LTK-cells has been described previously (Meakin et al. 1987). The plasmid pSTK7 was used for cotransfection with the expression vector pCOF-1. As a control vector, a plasmid construct similar to pCOF-1, except for the deletion of a single base pair in exon 1 was used; this deletion was expected to result in premature termination of translation.</p>The mouse LTK-cells were passaged in \u03b1-MEM medium supplemented with glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Biochemical selection for TK positive cells was achieved in medium containing hypoxanthine, aminopterin and thymidine (HAT medium).</p>DNA and RNA Analyses</p>Plasmid and DNA samples were prepared from the bacterial cells and genomic DNA from transfected mouse L cells. Total RNA was extracted from mammalian cells for examination of gene expression. Standard procedures, essentially as described by Sambrook et al (1989), for DNA ",
    " acid (FIG. 3).</p>Two other undesired nucleotide changes were detected in the middle cDNA segment. Since these latter substitutions, probably introduced during PCR, would change the encoded amino acids, it was necessary to replace the region containing these changes with a segment from the original plasmid.</p>The DNA sequence in all three resulting clones appeared to be stable after long term propagation in E. coli. Their entire coding region was sequenced and no additional changes were detected. It was noted that the transformation efficiency of these constructs in bacteria increased substantially (100 times higher than the unmodified cDNA) and that the copy number of plasmids (as reflected by the yield in DNA preparation) also increased.</p>Protein Synthesis by in vitro Translation</p>To ensure that the open reading frame in the full-length cDNA was uninterrupted, the in vitro translation method was performed. Accordingly, the propagation vector was linearized at an appropriate restriction site in the circular plasmid and used as the template for production of RNA suitable for translation in vitro. Since the entire CFTR protein would be probably too large to be translated in vitro, the experiment also included shorter transcripts produced from templates interrupted within the coding region.</p>An example of the result is shown in FIG. 10. The template used for this experiment was pBQ6.2 linearized at the HpaI site; the in vitro translation product was expected to be 86.2 kd. As shown in FIG. 10, a band migrating at the position of the expected molecular weight is clearly visible, indicating that translation initiates at the ATG codon as predicted and continues through the HpaI site in exon 13. The identity of this protein is also confirmed by its ability to react with a monoclonal antibody against CFTR. The other, smaller proteins observed in the products are probably results of premature termination or internal initiation of translation.</p>Similar experiments were performed with the plasmid treated with XbaI and EcoRI. Protein bands corresponding to the expected translation products 19 and 77.5 kd, respectively, were readily detectable on the polyacrylamide gel. These results, therefore, provided further confirmation that the predicted open reading frame was correct and intact in the full-length cDNA constructs.</p>Expression in Mouse L Cells</p>To examine if CFTR could be produced in heterologous mammalian cells, the pCOF-1 plasmid was used to transfect mouse LTK-cells. Another plasmid containing the herpes simplex virus TK gene was included in the transfection to allow biochemical selection of cells that were successfully transfected. A plasmid (pCONZ) which suffered a single base pair deletion immediately adjacent to the 3' initiation codon was used in a parallel transfection experiment as a negative control (as the frameshift would result in no CFTR products).</p>DNA Analysis</p>HAT-resistant L cell colonies were isolated and expanded into individual mass cultures and genomic DNA were isolated from these cultures for characterization of integrated plasmid DNA. As expected, all of the HAT-resistant L cell lines were found to contain an intact HSV TK gene (as demonstrated by gel-blot hybridization analysis). In addition, the copy number for the integrated plasmid DNA was found to vary among different lines, an anticipated from the calcium phosphate co-precipitation protocol. Gel-blot hybridization analysis was then performed for the cell cultures transfected with pCOF-1 and pCONZ. The full-length cDNA clone (a 6.2 kb PstI fragment from pBQ6.2) was used as proof to",
    "eight of them showed the predicted 1.5 kb and 2.5 kb EcorI fragments (see FIG. 12). Further analysis with BamHI and NcoI on five of them revealed that four (6a-1D; 6a-2F; 6b-J and 6b-K) contained intact 5' and 3' ends.</p>RNA Analysis</p>Expression of CFTR in the transformed mouse cell lines was next examined by RNA blot hybridization analysis. Two of the pCOF-1 transfected lines (4a-3I and 4a-3K) were found to express high levels of RNA (see FIG. 12a) but the remaining two lines 4a-1C and 4a-4Q) were low. In addition to the 6.2 kb band expected for correctly initiated and terminated CFTR RNA in these lines; however, hybridizing sequences were also detected at the 9-10 kb range, suggesting improper initiation or termination. A similar, high expression pattern was observed for three of the lines transfected with pCONZ (6a-1A; 6a-1D and 6b-J) (FIG. 12a). For clone 6a-2F, only a low level of the 6.2 kb species was detected. No RNA could be found for clone 6b-K, despite the presence of an apparent intact CFTR sequence.</p>The level of CFTR-derived RNA present varied among the cell lines mentioned above, with the strongest signals seen in clones 4a-3I and 6b-J. The variation was not due to poor sample preparation, as confirmed by hybridization analysis of the same blot with the TK probe (FIG. 12B).</p>Protein Analysis</p>Protein was then extracted from several representative cell lines and examined for the presence of CFTR-related products.</p>In the right panel of FIG. 13, a 170 kd band of appropriate size for the CFTR protein was clearly observed in the light membrane fraction, B, of 4a-3I. No CFTR protein was detected in LTK<sup>-</sup> extracts or in the 6b-I extracts.</p>1) A single 170 kdalton band was observed in the light membrane fraction from the cell line 4a-3I. This cell had been demonstrated by DNA analysis to contain multiple copies of the intact promoter of the expression vector and of the CFTR gene. RNA analysis also indicated expression of high levels of mRNA for this clone.</p>2) In contrast, the cell line 6b-I, generated with the mutant gene does not express a reacting 170 kdalton band. This line generated by co-transfection with the pCONZ plasmid was shown to have an intact promoter and gene portion. In addition, high levels of RNA were detected. Identical results for these samples were obtained even when the extracts were not subjected to heating prior to gel loading. 3) 170 kdalton bands were not observed in the cell line 4a-2D generated by the transfection experiment with the pCOF-1 plasmid and the cell line 2a-4A generated by the transfection with the pTK7 plasmid only. Genomic DNA analysis of the cell line 4a-2D indicated that only portions of the CFTR gene had been incorporated. As expected, no CFTR RNA could be detected.</p>For comparison, also shown on the protein analysis in FIG. 13 is a crude membrane preparation of the cell line T84 (provided by N. Kartner and J. Riordan). A single diffuse band is observed in the T84 pre",
    "2 mV). From this measurement, the calculated anion versus cation permeability was \u22485:1. Anion selectivity was assessed in cAMP-activated cells by replacing bath NaCl (135 mM) with sodium gluconate (135 mM). This manipulation resulted in a shift in reversal potential to +33 \u00b18 mV (n=4), toward the predicted E<sub>cl</sub> of +41 mV (FIG. 16C).</p>The inability to construct a full-length CFTR cDNA has hampered progress in understanding the structure and function of the protein. The difficulty is mainly due to the instability of the full-length sequence in E. coli, where there was sequence rearrangement often associated with a short (13 bp) direct repeat in exon 6b. Through the modification of DNA sequence within the first copy of the repeat, however, we have succeeded in the construction of three different plasmids each containing the entire coding sequence. These plasmids replicate efficiently in E. coli (DH5\u03b1), and are intact after prolonged propagation. Although this particular modification involves the first repeat, it is understood that this second repeat can also be similarly modified instead of, or in addition to, the first repeat to achieve similar success in the propagation of the CFTR cDNA.</p>In addition to verification by direct DNA sequencing, the plasmids have also been examined for their ability to product proteins of expected sized in vitro and in vivo. Based on the longest open reading frame of the consensus cDNA sequence (Riordan et al 1989), a protein of 170 kd (1480 amino acids) has been predicted as the CFTR gene product. The fact that a 170 kd band was detectable in the product translated in vitro and in cells transfected with the full-length CFTR cDNA confirms the original prediction.</p>The availability of a full-length CFTR cDNA that can be expressed in mammalian and non-mammalian cells offers the opportunity to perform a detailed structure and function analysis of CFTR. The vectors described here are excellent tools for this purpose. With appropriate regulatory sequences inserted upstream of the coding region, it is understood that large quantities of CFTR may be produced through different kinds of heterologous gene expression systems, whereby various biochemical and biophysical studies can be performed.</p>The ability to express the full-length cDNA also allows development of functional assays for CFTR. In this context, Drumm et al (1990) have demonstrated through a retrovirus-intermediate that the modified full-length cDNA described here was able to confer the function of CFTR in a pancreatic carcinoma cell line (CPFAC-1) derived from a CF patient. Upon proper expression of the cDNA, the cAMP-mediated chloride transport activity was restored in this cell line, providing the first example of functional complementation of CFTR activity. The ability to confer CFTR expression in heterologous cells is an important step towards the possibility of gene therapy in the lung and pancreas of CF patients.</p>In order to understand the role of individual amino acid residues as well as regions of the protein, site-direc"
