    "rapeutic potential of targeting NRF2 in the lung is not limited to COPD. Rather, targeting the NRF2 pathway could provide treatments for other human lung and respiratory diseases that exhibit oxidative stress components such as chronic asthma and acute asthma, lung disease secondary to environmental exposures including but not limited to ozone, diesel exhaust and occupational exposures, fibrosis, acute lung infection (e.g., viral (Noah, T. L. et al. 2014. PLoS ONE 9(6): e98671), bacterial or fungal), chronic lung infection, al antitrypsin disease, and cystic fibrosis (CF, Chen, J. et al. 2008. PLoS One, 2008; 3(10):e3367).</p>A therapy that targets the NRF2 pathway also has many potential uses outside the lung and respiratory system. Many of the diseases for which an NRF2 activator may be useful are autoimmune diseases (psoriasis, IBD, MS), suggesting that an NRF2 activator may be useful in autoimmune diseases in general.</p>In the clinic, a drug targeting the NRF2 pathway (bardoxolone methyl) has shown efficacy in diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy/chronic kidney disease (CKD) (Aleksunes, L. M., et al. 2010. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 335:2-12), though phase III trials with this drug in patients with the most severe stage of CKD were terminated. Furthermore, there is evidence to suspect that such a therapy would be effective in sepsis-induced acute kidney injury, other acute kidney injury (AKI) (Shelton, L. M., et al. 2013. Kidney International, June 19. doi: 10.1038/ki.2013.248.), and kidney disease or malfunction seen during kidney transplantation.</p>In the cardiac area, bardoxolone methyl is currently under investigation in patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension and so a drug targeting NRF2 by other mechanisms may also be useful in this disease area. Oxidative stress is increased in the diseased myocardium, resulting in accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which impairs cardiac function [Circ (1987) 76(2); 458-468] and increases susceptibility to arrhythmia [J of Mol &amp; Cell Cardio (1991) 23(8); 899-918] by a direct toxic effect of increased necrosis and apoptosis [Circ Res (2000) 87(12); 1172-1179]. In a mouse model of pressure overload (TAC), NRF2 gene and protein expression is increased during the early stage of cardiac adaptive hypertrophy but decreased in the later stage of maladaptive cardiac remodeling associated with systolic dysfunction [Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol (2009) 29(11); 1843-1850; PLOS ONE (2012) 7(9); e44899]. In addition, NRF2 activation has been shown to suppress myocardial oxidative stress as well as cardiac apoptosis, fibrosis, hypertrophy, and dysfunction in mouse models of pressure overload [Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol (2009) 29(11); J of Mol &amp; Cell Cardio (2014) 72; 305-315; and 1843-1850; PLOS ONE (2012) 7(9); e44899]. NRF2 activation has also been shown to protect against cardiac I/R injury in mice [Circ Res (2009) 105(4); 365-374; J of Mol &amp; Cell Cardio (2010) 49(4); 576-586",
    " </sub>overnight. On day two, plates are centrifuged and 50 nL of compound or controls are added to the cells. Plates are then incubated at 37\u00b0 C., 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>for 48 hours. On day four, medium is aspirated from the plate and crude cell lysates are made by adding 13 uL of 1\u00d7 Cell Signaling Technologies lysis buffer with 1 Complete, Mini, EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Tablet (Roche) for each 10 mL of lysis buffer. After lysis plates are incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature. Two microliters of lysate are removed for use in Cell Titer Glo assay (Promega) and MTT cocktail is prepared (Prochaska et. al. 1998) for measurement of NQO1 activity. Fifty microliters of MTT cocktail is added to each well, plate is centrifuged, and analyzed on an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer) using Absorbance 570 nm label for 30 minutes. Product formation is measured kinetically and the EC<sub>50 </sub>of NQO1 specific activity induction is calculated by plotting the change in absorbance (Delta OD/min) versus the log of compound concentration followed by 3-parameter fitting.</p>All examples described herein possessed NQO1 specific enzyme activity in BEAS-2B cells with EC<sub>50</sub>s between &gt;10 uM-&lt;lnM unless otherwise noted (see table below).
