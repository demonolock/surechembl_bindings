    "\" is used in the broadest sense and refers to any desirable effect and specifically includes clinical benefit as defined herein. </p> [0039] An \"individual\" or \"subject\" is a mammal. Mammals include, but are not limited to, domesticated animals (e.g. , cows, sheep, cats, dogs, and horses), primates (e.g., humans and non- \n\n human primates such as monkeys), rabbits, and rodents (e.g. , mice and rats). In certain embodiments, the individual or subject is a human. </p> [0040] The term Six-Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of the Prostate 1, also called STEAP-1, refers to a cell surface antigen predominantly expressed in prostate tissue, and is found to be upregulated in multiple cancer cell lines. Hubert et al. ( 1999), Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 96(25), 14523-8. An exemplary human STEAP-1 has an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 disclosed in US 2009/0280056 Al, filed 26 Oct 2007, the entire disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein. </p> [0041] The terms \"anti-STEAP-1 antibody\" and \"an antibody that binds to STEAP-1\" refer to an antibody that is capable of binding STEAP-1 with sufficient affinity such that the antibody is useful as a diagnostic agent in targeting STEAP-1. In one embodiment, the extent of binding of an anti- STEAP-1 antibody to an unrelated, non-STEAP-1 protein is less than about 10% of the binding of the antibody to STEAP-1 as measured, e.g. , by a radioimmunoassay (RIA). In certain embodiments, an antibody that binds to STEAP-1 has a dissociation constant (Kd) of &lt; \u0399 \u03bc\u039c, &lt; 100 nM, &lt; 10 nM, &lt; 1 nM, &lt; 0.1 nM, &lt; 0.01 nM, or &lt; 0.001 nM (e.g. 10<sup>\"8</sup> M or less, e.g. from 10<sup>\"8</sup> M to 10<sup>~13</sup> M, e.g. , from 10<sup>\"9</sup> M to 10<sup>~13</sup> M). In certain embodiments, an anti-STEAP-1 antibody binds to an epitope of STEAP-1 that is conserved among STEAP-1 from different species. </p>[0042] The term \"STEAP1-ADC\" refers to an anti-STEAP l antibody-drug conjugate. </p>[0043] The term \"CTC\" refers to circulating tumor cells. CTCs are cells of epithelial origin that are present in the circulation of patients with different solid malignancies. They are derived from clones of the primary tumor and are malignant. (See Fehm et al., Clin. Cancer Res. 8: 2073-84, 2002.) Specifically, CTCs shed into the vasculature from a primary tumor and circulate throughout the bloodstream and can serve as the \"seeds\" for subsequent metastases in vital distant organs, triggering a mechanism that is responsible for the vast majority of cancer-related deaths. Futhermore, Evidence has accumulated in the literature showing that CTCs can be considered an independent diagnostic for cancer progression of carcinomas (Beitsch &amp; Clifford, Am. J. Surg. 180(6): 446-49, 2000 (breast); Feezor et al., Ann. Oncol. Surg. 9( 10): 944-53, 2002 (colorectal); Ghossein et al., Diagn. Mol. Pathol. 8(4): 165-75, 1999 (melanoma, prostate, thyroid); Glaves, Br. J. Cancer 48: 665-73, 1983 (lung); Matsunami et al., Ann. Surg. Oncol. 10(2): 171-5, 2003 (gastric); Racila et al., 1998; Pantel et al., 1999). </p> [0044] \"Affinity\" refers to the strength of the sum total of noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g. , an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g. , an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, \"binding affinity\" refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1 : 1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g. , antibody and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant \n\n (Kd). Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art, including those described herein. Specific illustrative and exemplary embodiments for measuring binding affinity are described in the following. </p> [0045] The term \"antibody\" herein is used in the broadest sense and encompasses various antibody structures, including but not limited to monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g. , bispecific antibodies), and antibody fragments so long as they exhibit the desired antigen-binding activity. </p> [0046] An \"antibody fragment\" refers to a molecule other than an intact antibody that comprises a portion of an intact antibody that binds the antigen to which the intact antibody binds. Examples of antibody fragments include but are not limited to Fv, Fab, Fab', Fab'-SH, F(ab')<sub>2</sub>; diabodies; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody molecules (e.g. scFv); and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. </p> [0047] An \"antibody that binds to the same epitope\" as a reference antibody refers to an antibody that blocks binding of the reference antibody to its antigen in a competition assay by 50% or more, and conversely, the reference antibody blocks binding of the antibody to its antigen in a competition assay by 50% or more. An exemplary competition assay is provided herein. </p>[0048] The term \"antibody 15A5\" as used herein refers to a mouse monoclonal anti-STEAP-1 antibody produced by a hybridoma cell line having a m",
    "ody 15A5 binds, wherein antibody 15A5 is produced by a hybridoma cell having a microorganism deposit number of PTA-12259. \n\n [00110] In certain embodiments, the antibodies provided herein compete with 15A5 antibody for binding to STEAP-1. Competition assays may be used to identify an antibody that competes with the anti-STEAP-1 antibody 15A5 for binding to STEAP-1. </p> [00111] In an exemplary competition assay, immobilized STEAP-1 is incubated in a solution comprising a first labeled antibody that binds to STEAP-1 (e.g., 15A5) and a second unlabeled antibody that is being tested for its ability to compete with the first antibody for binding to STEAP-1. The second antibody may be present in a hybridoma supernatant. As a control, immobilized STEAP- 1 is incubated in a solution comprising the first labeled antibody but not the second unlabeled antibody. After incubation under conditions permissive for binding of the first antibody to STEAP-1, excess unbound antibody is removed, and the amount of label associated with immobilized STEAP-1 is measured. If the amount of label associated with immobilized STEAP-1 is substantially reduced in the test sample relative to the control sample, then that indicates that the second antibody is competing with the first antibody for binding to STEAP-1. See Harlow and Lane (1988) Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual ch.14 (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY). </p>[00112] In certain embodiments, the antibodies provided herein has a dissociation constant (Kd) to STEAP-1 of\u2264 1000 nM,\u2264 100 nM,\u2264 10 nM,\u2264 1 nM,\u2264 0.1 nM,\u2264 0.01 nM, or\u2264 0.001 nM (e.g. 10<sup>\"8</sup> M or less, e.g. from 10<sup>\"8</sup> M to 10<sup>\"13</sup> M, e.g. , from 10<sup>\"9</sup> M to 10<sup>\"13</sup> M). </p>[00113] In one embodiment, Kd is measured by a radiolabeled antigen binding assay (RIA) performed with the Fab version of an antibody of interest and its antigen as described by the following assay. Solution binding affinity of Fabs for antigen is measured by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of (<sup>125</sup>I)-labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen, then capturing bound antigen with an anti-Fab antibody-coated plate (see, e.g. , Chen et al., J. Mol. Biol. 293:865-881(1999)). To establish conditions for the assay, MICROTITER<sup>\u00ae</sup> multi-well plates (Thermo Scientific) are coated overnight with 5 \u03bcg/ml of a capturing anti-Fab antibody (Cappel Labs) in 50 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.6), and subsequently blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature (approximately 23 \u00b0C). In a non-adsorbent plate (Nunc #269620), 100 pM or 26 pM [<sup>125</sup>I]-anti gen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest (e.g., consistent with assessment of the anti-VEGF antibody, Fab-12, in Presta et al., Cancer Res. 57:4593-4599 (1997)). The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight; however, the incubation may continue for a longer period (e.g., about 65 hours) to ensure that equilibrium is reached. </p>Thereafter, the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature (e.g., for one hour). The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1% polysorbate 20 (TWEEN-20<sup>\u00ae</sup>) in PBS. When the plates have dried, 150 \u03bc\u0390/well of scintillant (MICROSCINT-20 ; Packard) is added, and the plates are counted on a TOPCOUNT\u2122 gamma counter (Packard) for \n\n ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20% of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays. </p> [00114] According to another embodiment, Kd is measured using surface plasmon resonance assays using a BIACORE<sup>\u00ae</sup>-2000 or a BIACORE<sup>\u00ae</sup>-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) at 25\u00b0C with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at -10 response units (RU). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIAcore, Inc.) are activated with N-ethyl-N'- (3-dimethylaminopropyl)- carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, to 5 \u03bcg/ml (-0.2 \u03bc\u039c) before injection at a flow rate of 5 \u03bc\u0390/minute to achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen, 1 M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% polysorbate 20 (TWEEN-20\u2122) surfactant (PBST) at 25\u00b0C at a flow rate of </p>approximately 25 \u03bc\u0390/min. Association rates (k<sub>on</sub>) and dissociation rates (k<sub>0</sub> f) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIACORE<sup>\u00ae</sup> Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneously fitting the association and dissociation sensorgrams. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) is calculated as the ratio k<sub>0</sub>ff/k<sub>on</sub> See, e.g. , Chen et al., J. Mol. Biol. 293:865-881 (1999). If the on-rate exceeds 10^ M<sup>~</sup>l s<sup>'</sup>l by the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation = 295 nm; emission = 340 nm, 16 nm bandpass) at 25\u00b0C of a 20 nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow equipped spectrophometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-AMINCO\u2122 spectrophotometer </p>(ThermoSpectronic) with a stirred cuvette. </p> [00115] Kinetic binding measurements can also be performed on an Octet Red instrument (ForteBio, Menlo Park, CA, USA). For example, all washes, dilutions and measurements are performed in Octet buffer (0.2% dodecyimaltoside, or DDM, - PBS) with the plate shaking at 1000 rpm. Streptavidin biosensors are equilibrated in Octet buffer for 10 min and then loaded with biotinylated STEAP-1 (from viral iysate in 1 % DDM, diluted 1 :8 in Octet Buffer) for 5 min and washed for 10 min. For the association phase, the ligand-coated streptavidin tips are immersed in anti-STEAP-1 antibody fragments for 10 min (eight serial two-fold dilutions, starting at 500 or 50 nM). Dissociation of the Ab-STEAP-1 complex can be measured in wells containing Octet buffer alone for 600 s. KD, Ka and Kd are determined with Octet evaluation software v6.3 using a 1 : 1 binding model with global fitting. </p>[00116] In certain embodiments, the antibodies provided herein include, without limitation, murine antibodies, sheep antibodies and rabbit antibodies. In certain embodiments, the antibodies are murine monoclonal antibody. \n\n [00117] In certain embodiments, the antibodies provided herein comprise at least one of the CDR regions of the antibody 15A5. The CDR regions of an antibody can be determined using methods known in the art. Exemplary CDRs (CDR-Ll, CDR-L2, CDR-L3, CDR-Hl, CDR-H2, and CDR-H3) occur at amino acid residues 24-34 of LI, 50-56 of L2, 89-97 of L3, 31-35B of HI, 50-65 of H2, and 95-102 of H3. (Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD ( 1991).) With the exception of CDR1 in heavy chain variable regions, CDRs generally comprise the amino acid residues that form the hypervariable loops. CDRs also comprise \"specificity determining residues,\" or \"SDRs,\" which are residues that contact antigen. SDRs are contained within regions of the CDRs called abbreviated-CDRs, or a- CDRs. Exemplary a-CDRs (a-CDR-Ll, a-CDR-L2, a-CDR-L3, a-CDR-Hl, a-CDR-H2, and a-CDR- H3) occur at amino acid residues 31-34 of LI, 50-55 of L2, 89-96 of L3, 31-35B of HI, 50-58 of H2, and 95-102 of H3.
