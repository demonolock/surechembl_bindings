{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences with concrete data points that meet the specified criteria:\n\n\nThe IC50 values for each compound were determined by testing the activity of IDO in a mixture containing 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5; 70 nM purified human IDO protein, 200 \u03bcM L-tryptophan, 20 mM ascorbate, 20 \u03bcM methylene blue, 0.1% DMSO.\nCompounds with an IC50 of less than 500 \u03bcM were considered as active inhibitors in this assay.\nControl samples with no IDO inhibitor, or with no IDO enzyme or with the reference inhibitors 1-methyl-tryptophan (200 \u03bcM) and menadione (1.2 \u03bcM) were used as controls to set the parameters for the non-linear regressions necessary for determination of the IC50 for each compound."}
