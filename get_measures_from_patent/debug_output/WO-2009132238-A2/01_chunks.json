    "s methods for altering T cell-mediated immunity comprising altering local extracellular concentrations of tryptophan and tryptophan metabolites, using an inhibitor of IDO such as 1- methyl-DL-tryptophan, p-(3-benzofuranyl)-DL-alanine, p-[3-benzo(b)thienyl]-DL-alanine, \n\n and 6-nitro-L-tryptophan) (Munn, 1999). Reported in WO 03/087347, also published as European Patent 1501918, are methods of making antigen-presenting cells for enhancing or reducing T cell tolerance (Munn, 2003). Compounds having indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitory activity are further reported in WO 2004/094409; and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0234623 is directed to methods of treating a subject with a cancer or an infection by the administration of an inhibitor of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase in combination with other therapeutic modalities.</p>[0012] In light of the experimental data indicating a role for IDO in immunosuppression, tumor resistance and/or rejection, chronic infections, HIV-infection, AIDS (including its manifestations such as cachexia, dementia and diarrhea), autoimmune diseases or disorders (such as rheumatoid arthritis), and immunologic tolerance and prevention of fetal rejection in utero, therapeutic agents aimed at suppression of tryptophan degradation by inhibiting IDO activity are desirable. Inhibitors of IDO can be used to activate T cells and therefore enhance T cell activation when the T cells are suppressed by pregnancy, malignancy or a virus such as HIV. Inhibition of IDO may also be an important treatment strategy for patients with neurological or neuropsychiatric diseases or disorders such as depression. The compounds, compositions and methods herein help meet the current need for IDO modulators.</p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</p>[0013] In one aspect, the invention comprises compounds and pharmaceutical compositions containing them together with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, diluent, or carrier, where the compounds are of formula (I) or (II),</p><img id=\"imgf000005_0001\" path=\"imgf000005_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/90093550/WO/20091029/A2/002009/13/22/38/imgf000005_0001.tif\"/></p>(I) (H)</p>[0014] a tautomer thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein R<sup>1</sup>, R<sup>4</sup>, and</p>R<sup>5</sup> are defined herein.</p>[0015] In a second aspect, the invention comprises compounds and pharmaceutical compositions containing them together with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, diluent, or carrier, are provided where the compounds are according to formula (III), \n\n R<sup>1</sup></p>-N</p>R<sup>5</sup></p>(III) [0016] or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein R<sup>1</sup> and R<sup>5</sup> are defined herein.</p>[0017] In a third aspect, the invention comprises compounds and pharmaceutical compositions containing them together with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, diluent, or carrier, are provided where the compounds are according to fo",

The filtered supernatant was loaded onto a 60 mL phosphocellulose column equilibrated with 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 6.5 (KPB) at 1-3 mL/min. The column was washed with 3 volumes of 50 mM KPB, 3 volumes of 100 mM KPB and the protein was eluted with 15 volumes of a linear gradient of 100-500 mM KPB. Fractions were collected and IDO activity assay was performed by measuring kynurenine production. This was carried out by mixing 50 \u03bcL of each fraction with 100 \u03bcL of reaction mix to yield a final concentration of 50 mM KPB buffer, 20 mM ascorbic acid, 200 \u03bcg/mL catalase, 20 \u03bcM methylene blue and 400 \u03bcM L- tryptophan. Fractions demonstrating IDO activity were loaded onto a Ni-NTA purification column (15 mL). This affinity purification column was washed with 10 volumes of 250 mM KPB, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM imidazole pH 8, and eluted with 10 volumes of buffer containing 250 mM KPB, 150 mM NaCl and a 50 to 250 mM imidazole linear gradient. Collected fractions were assayed by IDO enzymatic assay described above and the positive fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration and dialyzed against a buffer containing 250 mM KPB, 50% glycerol.

The inhibitors were initially diluted in DMSO at 100 mM and were diluted in potassium phosphate 50 mM, added to the reaction mixture at final concentrations raging from 1 mM to 5 nM and preincubated with the enzyme for 5 min at 25 <sup>0</sup>C. The reaction was started by addition of L-tryptophan to 200 \u03bcM and incubated 15 min at 37 <sup>0</sup>C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 0.5 vol of 30% trichloroacetic acid and incubated 30 min at 60 <sup>0</sup>C to hydrolyze N-formylkynurenine to kynurenine. The reaction was centrifuged at 3400 g for 5 min to remove precipitated protein and the supernatant was reacted with 2% (w/v) of p- dimethylaminobenzaldehyde in acetic acid. The reaction was incubated 10 min at 25 <sup>0</sup>C and read at 480 nm in a spectrophotometer. Control samples with no IDO inhibitor, or with no \n\n IDO enzyme or with the reference inhibitors 1-methyl-tryptophan (200 \u03bcM) and menadione (1.2 \u03bcM) were used as controls to set the parameters for the non-linear regressions necessary for determination of the IC50 for each compound.
