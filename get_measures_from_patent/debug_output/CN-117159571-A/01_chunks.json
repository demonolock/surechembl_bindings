    "/p>Example 8 MYR prevents DOX-induced sarcomere destruction</p>DOX-induced cell death is often manifested as severe disruption of myocardial tissue (e.g., sarcomere) structure. To assess the protective effect of MYR on DOX-induced sarcomere destruction, human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes were treated with DMSO, DOX (0.5 \u03bcm), or DOX plus MYR (100 \u03bcm). After 72 hours of treatment, cells were immunostained with anti-cardiac troponin T antibodies (Abcam) to reveal sarcomere tissue in heart cells. As shown in fig. 12, MYR confers significant protection of cardiomyocytes against DOX-induced sarcomere destruction, suggesting that MYR protection against DOX-induced cell death is fully manifested by the structural integrity of cardiomyocytes. </p>EXAMPLE 9 Myrican is a potent TOPOII alpha and beta inhibitor</p>In order to gain insight into the cardioprotective molecular mechanisms of Myricetin (MYR) and Dexrazoxane (DEX), the effect of both compounds on topoisomerase II (i.e., topoii\u03b1 and \u03b2) (a distinct target of DOX) was evaluated.</p>200ng of animal base DNA (kDNA) were incubated with one enzyme unit of TOPOII alpha or TOPOII beta enzyme (Inspialis) at various concentrations of MYR or DEX for 30 minutes at 37 \u2103. The reaction was then separated on a 1% agarose gel to visualize the decolorized DNA (bottom band). The efficiency of catalytic inhibition was quantified by measuring the relative intensities of the bands.</p>MYR and DEX showed 50% inhibition of TOPOII alpha enzyme activity (IC 50) at concentrations of 1.18 \u03bcm and 52.70 \u03bcm, respectively (fig. 13; n=3). IC50 of MYR and DEX for TOPOII beta enzyme activity was 2.07. Mu.M and 34.43. Mu.M, respectively (FIG. 13; n=3). These data indicate that MYR is a significantly more potent inhibitor than DEX for both topoisomerase II alpha and beta.</p>Example 10 MYR does not induce TOPOII protein degradation unlike DEX</p>To further distinguish the molecular mechanisms of MYR from DEX, and also to determine if the observed inhibition of TOPOII by MYR in the above-described decolorization assay was due to TOPOII protein degradation, human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes were treated with DMSO, DEX (100 \u03bcm) or MYR (100 \u03bcm) for 24 hours and immunostained with anti-topoisomerase II \u03b2 antibodies (BD Biosciences). </p>Cells were imaged using an incall Analyzer2200 (GE) and topoisomerase il\u03b2 protein levels were quantified. Student T-test (unpaired, two-tailed) was used to determine the significance of the differences.</p>As shown in fig. 14, treatment with DEX resulted in a significant disappearance of topoii\u03b2 in iPSC-CM, whereas MYR had no effect on topoisomerase il\u03b2 protein levels (fig. 14) (n=3). The results confirm this hypothesis: DEX can have an adverse effect on the stability of topoisomerase il\u03b2 (TOPOII \u03b2), which can lead to the depletion of these enzymes from heart cells, effectively preventing DNA damage from the toxic effects of anthracyclines on these enzymes. These results also demonstrate that the protection mechanism conferred by MYR on anthracycline-induced toxicity is completely indep",
    "was also confirmed in separate experiments with dihydrolocust bean gum (DHR) and locust bean gum (ROB), wherein DHR showed no inhibitory activity on these topoisomerase as with DHM, whereas locust bean gum showed high level of inhibitory effect on both TOPOII \u03b2 and TOPOII \u03b1 as with MYR. These data indicate that structural differences in the C-ring of flavone/flavonoid scaffolds play an important role in TOPOII inhibition. </p>Example 12 MYR was 2-fold more potent at protecting DOX-induced cell death than DHM</p>Next, the ability of MYR to confer cardioprotection was directly compared to DHM, as both compounds showed unique properties in terms of their structure and TOPOII inhibitory activity. Cell samples were prepared by differentiating induced pluripotent stem cells into cardiomyocytes. The cells were cultured for 4 days after differentiation, the medium was changed on day 3, and then experiments were performed. Human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes were treated with 0.5 \u03bcm doxorubicin and increasing concentrations of myricetin (MYR, circles) or dihydromyricetin (DHM, triangles). After 72 hours of treatment, cells were incubated with dyes indicating mitochondrial health and nuclei. Cells were then imaged and the total number of healthy cells counted and plotted as a percentage of doxorubicin-treated controls as described above.</p>As shown in fig. 16, MYR exhibited 2-fold efficacy in protecting DOX-induced cell death over DHM, because the half maximal effective concentrations (EC 50) of MYR and DHM were 7.50 \u03bcm and 13.96 \u03bcm, respectively. (n=3) based on these results, it was concluded that: the double bond on the C-ring of the flavone/flavonoid scaffold enhances the efficacy of the cardioprotective properties by conferring inhibition of topoisomerase II. </p>These observations were then made by a DOX-induced DNA double strand break assay. Human cardiomyocytes were treated with 0.5 \u03bcm doxorubicin and increasing concentrations of MYR (circles) or DHM (triangles). After 48 hours of treatment, cells were immunostained with anti- \u03b3h2ax antibody (EMDMillipore) to detect DNA double strand breaks. Cells were imaged using an incall Analyzer2200 (GE) and the percentage of \u03b3h2ax positive cells under each condition was quantified. Consistent with its rate of cell death rescue, MYR was 2-fold more potent at protecting DOX-induced double strand breaks than DHM. The concentration of MYR and DHM that reduced the DOX-induced double strand break by 50% (IC 50) was 5.28 \u03bcm and 11.30 \u03bcm, respectively (fig. 17). (n=3)</p>To study the effect of myricetin on cardiomyocytes exposed to doxorubicin, mRNA expression levels were determined in cells treated with DOX alone, myricetin alone, and DOX plus myricetin alone. Surprisingly, although myricetin itself had no effect on TOPOII \u03b2 mRNA expression, DOX significantly inhibited TOPOII \u03b2 expression at 24 hours and 48 hours (fig. 18). However, in the presence of myricetin, myricetin restored TOPOII \u03b2 expression to near normal levels, effectively preventing any transcriptional changes caused by DOX (fig. 18). The data indicate that DOX and myricetin appear to have a synergistic effect on TOPOII beta expression. DOX slowly inhibits TOPOII alpha expression over time relative to TOPOII alpha expression. However, myricetin further inhibited TOPOII \u03b1 in the presence of DOX, indicating that myricetin has a different effect on these topoisomerase II at the molecular and cellular levels. The combined downregulating effect of myricetin and DOX on TOPOII alpha was greater than that observed with DOX alone. </p>Example 13 cardioprotective Properties of MYR analogs</p>To further investigate the relationship between structure (e.g., flavone/flavonoid scaffold) and biological activity (e.g., cardioprotection, TOPOII inhibition, etc.), a set of additional flavonoid compounds associated with buxine were identified and tested for activity.</p>I.
