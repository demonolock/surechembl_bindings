    "iRNA compound anneal, for example to form a hybrid made exclusively of Watson-Crick base pairs in the region of exact complementarity. A \u201csufficiently complementary\u201d target RNA can include an internal region (e.g., of at least 10 nucleotides) that is exactly complementary to a target RNA. Moreover, in certain embodiments, the siRNA compound specifically discriminates a single-nucleotide difference. In this case, the siRNA compound only mediates RNAi if exact complementary is found in the region (e.g., within 7 nucleotides of) the single-nucleotide difference.</p>RNA interference (RNAi) may be used to specifically inhibit expression of target polynucleotides. Double-stranded RNA-mediated suppression of gene and nucleic acid expression may be accomplished according to the invention by introducing dsRNA, siRNA or shRNA into cells or organisms. SiRNA may be double-stranded RNA, or a hybrid molecule comprising both RNA and DNA, e.g., one RNA strand and one DNA strand. It has been demonstrated that the direct introduction of siRNAs to a cell can trigger RNAi in mammalian cells (Elshabir, S. M., et al. Nature 411:494-498 (2001)). Furthermore, suppression in mammalian cells occurred at the RNA level and was specific for the targeted genes, with a strong correlation between RNA and protein suppression (Caplen, N. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98:9746-9747 (2001)). In addition, it was shown that a wide variety of cell lines, including HeLa S3, COS7, 293, NIH/3T3, A549, HT-29, CHO-KI and MCF-7 cells, are susceptible to some level of siRNA silencing (Brown, D. et al. TechNotes 9(1):1-7, available on the worldwide web at www.dot.ambion.dot.com/techlib/tn/91/912.html (Sep. 1, 2002)).</p>RNAi molecules targeting specific polynucleotides can be readily prepared according to procedures known in the art. Structural characteristics of effective siRNA molecules have been identified. Elshabir, S. M. et al. (2001) Nature 411:494-498 and Elshabir, S. M. et al. (2001), EMBO 20:6877-6888. Accordingly, one of skill in the art would understand that a wide variety of different siRNA molecules may be used to target a specific gene or transcript. In certain embodiments, siRNA molecules according to the invention are double-stranded and 16-30 or 18-25 nucleotides in length, including each integer in between. In one embodiment, an siRNA is 21 nucleotides in length. In certain embodiments, siRNAs have 0-7 nucleotide 3\u2032 overhangs or 0-4 nucleotide 5\u2032 overhangs. In one embodiment, an siRNA molecule has a two nucleotide 3\u2032 overhang. In one embodiment, an siRNA is 21 nucleotides in length with two nucleotide 3\u2032 overhangs (i.e. they contain a 19 nucleotide complementary region between the sense and antisense strands). In certain embodiments, the overhangs are UU or dTdT 3\u2032 overhangs.</p>Generally, siRNA molecules are completely complementary to one strand of a target DNA molecule, since even single base pair mismatches have been shown to reduce silencing. In other embodiments, s"
