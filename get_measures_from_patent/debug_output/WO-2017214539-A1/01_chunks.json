    "re evaluated using a voltage protocol in which cells were voltage- clamped at a holding potential of -110 mV. Potassium currents were activated with a series of voltage steps from -110 mV to +50 mV in 10 mV intervals with 5.5 seconds between successive voltage steps. Each voltage step was 3 seconds in duration and immediately followed by a 1 second voltage step to -120 mV to generate an inward \"tail\" current to allow construction of activation (G-V) curves by plotting normalized peak tail current versus the potential of the activating voltage step. To obtain normalized values, peak current amplitudes for successive depolarizing pulses were normalized against the maximum tail current amplitude generated at +50 mV (Tatulian et al, Journal of Neuroscience 2001, 21 (15)). </p> Data Analysis: Data was collected on the Syncropatch platform using PatchControl software (Nanion) and processed and analyzed using DataControl Software (Nanion). </p>Normalized percent activation was calculated and activation curves were fit with a Boltzmann function to determine the midpoint voltage of activation (G-V midpoint) for both pre-compound and post-compound conditions for each of the 384-wells of a seal chip with Pipeline Pilot (Accelrys). The difference in G-V midpoint between pre-compound and post-compound conditions (\u0394 V0.5) was plotted as a function of concentration and concentration-response curves were fit with a three-parameter logistic equation {Y=Bottom + (Top-Bottom)/(l+10<sup>A</sup>(LogEC50- X))} for determination of the EC<sub>50</sub> (Graphpad Prism). \n\n Assessment Results: Exemplary compounds of the present application were tested for their ability to produce a concentration-dependent hyperpolarizing shift in the midpoint of activation for heteromeric Kv7.2/7.3 channels. Eight of the compounds produced a quantifiable hyperpolarizing shift in activation as determined by a concentration-dependent shift in the midpoint that could be fit with a 3-parameter logistic equation. These data were combined with the initial 8-point concentration-response data in a single fit. Potency and efficacy data for each compound are summarized in Table 2 and Figures 2A-2F. </p>Table 2. </p><img id=\"imgf000118_0002\" path=\"imgf000118_0002.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/415487130/WO/20171214/A1/002017/21/45/39/imgf000118_0002.tif\"/></p> A: 0.1 t to 50 \u03bc\u039c </p><img id=\"imgf000118_0001\" path=\"imgf000118_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/415487202/WO/20171214/A1/002017/21/45/39/imgf000118_0001.tif\"/></p> Compound X Compound 10 \n\n EQUIVALENTS </p> Those skilled in the art will recognize, or be able to ascertain, using no more than routine experimentation, numerous equivalents to the specific embodiments described specifically herein.
