{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nThe results (inhibition constants Ki (FXa) for inhibition of factor Xa) are shown in Table 1.\n\n\nNote that the text does not provide explicit numeric values for the bioactivity metrics (IC50, Ki, Kd, EC50) along with units, except for the mention of enzyme concentrations (0.5 nM, 5 nM, 10 nM) and substrate concentrations (140 \u03bcM, 500 \u03bcM) in the assay descriptions. However, these values are not directly related to a specific molecule's bioactivity metric. The text primarily describes the methods and procedures for determining these metrics. \n\nIf you'd like, I can try to extract more information or context, but based on the provided criteria, the above sentence is the only one that comes close to meeting the requirements."}
