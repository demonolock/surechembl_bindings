Moreover such arylations can also be accomplished by reaction of a wide range of substituted aryl boronic acids as demonstrated for example by W. Mederski, M. Lefort, M. Germann, D. Kux, Tetrahedron 1999, 55,<sub>,</sub>,12757; J. Collman et al., J. Org. Chem. 2001 , 66, 7892. Preferred methods include, but are not limited to those described in the examples.</p>The compounds of the present invention are serine protease inhibitors, which inhibit the activity of the blood coagulation enzyme factors Xa and/or factor Vila. In particular, they are highly active inhibitors of factor Xa. They are specific serine protease inhibitors inasmuch as they do not substantially inhibit the activity of other proteases whose inhibition is not desired. The activity of the compounds of the formulae I and la \n\ncan be determined, for example, in the assays described below or in other assays known to those skilled in the art. With respect to factor Xa inhibition, a preferred embodiment of the invention comprises compounds which have a Ki &lt; 1 mM for factor Xa inhibition as determined in the assay described below, with or without concomitant factor Vila inhibition, and which preferably do not substantially inhibit the activity of other proteases involved in coagulation and fibrinolysis whose inhibition is not desired (using the same concentration of the inhibitor). The compounds of the invention inhibit factor Xa catalytic activity either directly, within the prothrombinase complex or as a soluble subunit, or indirectly, by inhibiting the assembly of factor Xa into the prothrombinase complex.</p>As inhibitors of factor Xa and/or factor Vila the compounds of the formulae I and la and their physiologically tolerable salts and their prodrugs are generally suitable for the therapy and prophylaxis of conditions in which the activity of factor Xa and/or factor Vila plays a role or has an undesired extent, or which can favorably be influenced by inhibiting factor Xa and/or factor Vila or decreasing their activities, or for the prevention, alleviation or cure of which an inhibition of factor Xa and/or factor Vila or a decrease in their activity is desired by the physician. As inhibition of factor Xa and/or factor Vila influences blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, the compounds of the formulae I and la and their physiologically tolerable salts and their prodrugs are generally suitable for reducing blood clotting, or for the therapy and prophylaxis of conditions in which the activity of the blood coagulation syste",
    "e lithium hydroxide monohydrate (60 mg) was added and the mixture was refluxed for 4h. After cooling to RT the mixture was concentrated, acidified to pH 3 with 2N HCl and extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases were washed with brine, dried (MgS0<sub>4</sub>) and concentrated under reduced prssure to give crude 1-[5-(5-chloro-thiophen-2-yl)-isoxazol-3-ylmethyl]-4-formyl-3,5- dimethyl-1 H-pyrrole-2- carboxylic acid (100 mg) which was directly used in the next step.</p>(iii) 1-[5-(5-Chloro-thiophen-2-yl)-isoxazol-3-ylmethyl]-4-formyl-3,5-dimethyl-1 H-pyrrole- 2-carboxylic acid (1-isopropyl-piperidin-4-yl)-amide: To the foregoing acid (100 mg) in DCM (2 mL) was added DIEA (142 mg), HATU (104 mg) and 1-isopropyl-piperidin-4- ylamine (39 mg). The mixture was stirred .for 2h at RT after which it was concentrated. The residue was subjected to preparative HPLC.(CH<sub>3</sub>CN/H<sub>2</sub>0 gradient + 0.05 % TFA) to give 1-[5-(-chloro-thiophen-2-yl)-isoxazol-3-ylmethyl]-4-formyl-3,5-dimethyl-1 H- pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid (1-isopropyl-piper\u03cadin-4-yl)-amide as its trifluoroacetate salt (101 mg). MS (ESI<sup>+</sup>): m/e =489 [M+H]<sup>+</sup>, chloro pattern. \n\nPharmacological testing</p>The ability of the compounds of the formulae I and la to inhibit factor Xa or factor Vila or other enzymes like thrombin, plasmin, or trypsin can be assessed by determining the concentration of the compound of the formulae I and la that inhibits enzyme activity by 50 %, i. e. the IC50 value, which was related to the inhibition constant Ki. Purified enzymes were used in chromogenic assays. The concentration of inhibitor that causes a 50 % decrease in the rate of substrate hydrolysis was determined by linear regression after plotting the relative rates of hydrolysis (compared to the uninhibited control) versus the log of the concentration of the compound of formulae I and la. For calculating the inhibition constant Ki, the 1C50 value was corrected for competition with substrate using the formula Ki = 1C50 / {1 + (substrate concentration / Km)} wherein Km is the Michaelis-Menten constant (Chen and Prusoff, Biochem. Pharmacol. 22 (1973), 3099-3108; l. H. Segal, Enzyme Kinetics, 1975, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 100-125; which were incorporated herein by reference), a) Factor Xa Assay</p>In the assay for determining the inhibition of factor Xa activity TBS-PEG buffer (50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.8, 200 mM NaCl, 0.05 % (w/v) PEG-8000, 0.02 % (w/v) NaN3) was used. The IC50 was determined by combining in appropriate wells of a Costar half- area microtiter plate 25 \u03bcl human factor Xa (Enzyme Research Laboratories, Inc.; South Bend, Indiana) in TBS-PEG; 40 \u03bcl 10 % (v/v) DMSO in TBS-PEG (uninhibited control) or various concentrations of the compound to be tested diluted in 10 % (v/v) DMSO in TBS-PEG; and substrate S-2765 (N(\u03b1)-benzyloxycarbonyl-D-Arg-Gly-L-Arg- p-nitroanilide; Kabi Pharmacia, Inc.; Franklin, Ohio) in TBS-PEG.</p>The assay was performed by pre-incubating the compound of formulae I and la plus enzyme for 10 min. Then the assay was initiated by adding substrate to obtain a final volume of 100 \u03bcl. The initial velocity of chromogenic substrate hydrolysis was measured by the change in absorbance at 405 nm using a Bio-tek Instruments kinetic plate reader (Ceres UV900HDi) at 25 \u00b0C during the linear portion of the time course (usually 1.5 min after addition of substrate). The enzyme concentration was 0.5 nM and substrate concentration was 140 \u03bcM. \n\n b) Factor Vila Assay The inhibitory activity towards factor Vila/tissue factor activity was determined using a chromogenic assay essentially as described previously (J. A. Ostrem et al., Biochemistry 37 (1998) 1053-1059 which was incorporated herein by reference). Kinetic assays were conducted at 25 \u00b0C in half-area microtiter plates (Costar Corp., Cambridge, Massachusetts) using a kinetic plate reader (Molecular Devices Spectramax 250). A typical assay consisted of 25 \u03bcl human factor Vila and TF (5 nM and 10 nM, respective final concentration) combined with 40 \u03bcl of inhibitor dilutions in 10% DMSO/TBS-PEG buffer (50 mM Tris, 15 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCI<sub>2</sub>, 0.05 % PEG 8000, pH 8.15). Following a 15-minutes preincubation period, the assay was initiated by the addition of 35 \u03bcl of the chromogenic substrate S-2288 (D-lle-Pro-Arg-p- nitroanilide, Pharmacia Hepar Inc., 500 \u03bcM final concentration). The results (inhibition constants Ki (FXa) for inhibition of factor Xa) are shown in Table 1. Tablel :</p></p>"
