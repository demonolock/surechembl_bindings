    "r more combination or free form.</p>The disclosure also provides and reduced the method that Neu5Gc produces in the animal that contains the Neu5Gc enzymatic pathway, described method comprises the Neu5Ac that animal is used significant quantity, its derivative, analogue or precursor, the generation that wherein said significant quantity reduces or removes Neu5Gc in the described animal.</p>Be useful in the animal purposes method of (comprising people's purposes) above-mentioned, Neu5Ac can be the form of meal supplement, can be used as the part of the natural dietary product that comprises high-level Neu5Ac, can be synthetic Neu5Ac, can be monomer or polymer form, bonded or the Neu5Ac of combining form not.About cultural method, can be with from synthetic or other production methods, in the Neu5Ac adding substratum in conjunction with, non-binding form.For use or dietary consumption for, Neu5Ac can be the form of purifying basically.</p>The details of one or more embodiments of the present disclosure is as shown in appended accompanying drawing and following description.From specification sheets and accompanying drawing and claim, other features of the present disclosure, target and advantage will be obvious.</p>The accompanying drawing summary</p>Fig. 1 is presented in two clones and adds and the Neu5Gc when not adding Neu5Ac contains spirogram.Stable transfection, the soluble saliva of express recombinant exempts from lectin 9-Fc or saliva is exempted from the proteic CHO-KI cell of lectin 13-Fc, when not having or existing 5mM Neu5Ac (Ac) growth.The CHOSig9 cell grows to 70% and converges in the MEM alpha that contains 10%FCS and 80 \u03bc M MTX.The CHOSig13 cell grows to 70% and converges in the MEM alpha that contains 10%FCS and 1.2mg/ml G418.At first wash described cell twice with PBS, add the Optimem substratum three days contain 2% low IgG FCS and 5mM Neu5Ac then, collected described substratum (the 3rd day) at the 3rd day, adding contains the fresh culture of Neu5Ac and in (the 5th day) collection two days later, adding contains the fresh culture of Neu5Ac and collected at the 7th day once more.The substratum of each collection is centrifugal to remove cell debris, be adjusted to 5mM Tris-HCl pH 8 and with protein-A agarose of 250 \u03bc l, under 4 \u2103, hatch 3 days with in conjunction with chimeric protein.At each time point and cell type, clean resin with PBS, and with the glycine wash-out of 0.1M pH3.After being neutralized to pH7, use Millipore Ultrafree-15 30K stopper to concentrate eluted protein with 1M Tris-HCl pH 8.Use Pierce BCA protein determination test kit to determine proteinic concentration.With purified proteinic equal portions with 2M acetic acid 80 \u2103 of following hydrolysis 3 hours to discharge sialic acid, carry out derivatize with DMB reagent subsequently.HPLC analyzes by reverse-phase chromatography and is carrying out under 0.9ml/min with 85% water, 8% acetonitrile and 7% methyl alcohol on the C18 post, in pattern such as degr",
    "pect to Neu5Ac the per-cent of Neu5Gc in each sample.The result shows that the amount that is attached to two kinds of proteic Neu5Gc all significantly reduces by the adding of Neu5Ac.This provides and reduced the method that the Neu5Gc in the biotherapy product of producing pollutes in Chinese hamster ovary celI.</p>Fig. 2 A-E show to reduce the method that the Neu5Gc in the biotherapy product for preparing pollutes in the people's cell that has accumulated from the Neu5Gc of environment.(A-B) raise the content that people 293T cell has reduced the Neu5Gc that is pre-existing in the glycoconjugate with free Neu5Ac.People 293T cell was grown 3 days in DME+10%FCS, in the presence of 5mM Neu5Gc, so that cell loading Neu5Gc.Clean described cell with PBS then, it is divided in two kinds of identical cultures, a kind ofly added 5mM Neu5Ac, and another kind does not have.Then as shown in the figure with cell cultures a couple of days, harvested cell is analyzed the content of the soluble low molecular weight fraction of ethanol (A) and the precipitable protein of ethanol (B) Neu5Gc and Neu5Ac in the two with HPLC.Shown %Neu5Gc is with respect to total sialic acid, the amount of Neu5Gc.As seen the speed that Neu5Gc removes has been accelerated in the existence of Neu5Ac in substratum significantly from cell.(C-E) raise Chinese hamster ovary celI with free Neu5Ac and reduced total cytolemma of animal cell line and the Neu5Gc in the excretory glycoprotein with endogenous CMAH.The CHO-KI cell of the soluble IgG-Fc fusion rotein of the express recombinant of stable transfection is grown when not having or existing 5mM Neu5Ac (Ac).At first clean cell twice with PBS, add the Optimem substratum three days contain 2% low IgG FCS and 5mM Neu5Ac then, collected described substratum (the 3rd day) at the 3rd day, add and contain the fresh culture of Neu5Ac and (the 5th day) collection after 2 days, adding contains the fresh culture of Neu5Ac and collected at the 7th day once more.The substratum of each collection is centrifugal to remove cell debris, be adjusted to 5mM Tris-HCl pH 8.With protein-A agarose purified fusion protein.(C) with purified proteinic equal portions with 2M acetic acid 80 \u2103 of following hydrolysis 3 hours to discharge sialic acid, carry out derivatize with DMB reagent subsequently and make it to stand the HPLC analysis.Obtain the area under each peak and determined with respect to Neu5Ac the per-cent of Neu5Gc in each sample.As seen the content of Neu5Gc obviously reduces with respect to contrast.(D) preparation is from total cytolemma of identical Chinese hamster ovary celI and be used for DMB-HPLC and analyze.The content of visible Neu5Gc obviously reduces with respect to contrast once more.(E) transfer on the nitrocellulose membrane from the CHO membranin of above-mentioned experiment and with it by the SDSPAGE separation.By with the polyclone chicken of affinity purification anti--the Neu5Gc antibody incubation detects the expression of Ne"
