    "cies of HIV cause HIV infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Any HIV infection may be treated at any stage of the disease using the compounds provided herein, e.g. at an early stage when virus is detectable by overt symptoms are not present, or at a later stage such as full blown AIDS. </p> RNA viral infections caused by one or more members of the Orthomyxoviridae family of RNA viruses may also be treated. In particular, the genera Influenzavirus A, Influenzavirus B, and </p>Influenzavirus C, which cause infections in humans. More particularly, Influenzavirus A viral infections are treated, i.e. those which cause flu pandemics. </p>In some aspects, the compound used is the compound Il-a of formula </p><img id=\"imgf000030_0002\" path=\"imgf000030_0002.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/717614639/WO/20200423/A1/002020/08/11/43/imgf000030_0002.tif\"/></p> In some aspect, CEM-SS cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C/5% C0<sub>2</sub> with serially diluted compound and a known titer of HlV-lme for 6 days. The CEM-SS cell line is a derivative of the human T lymphosarcoma cell line CEM that is permissive for v// deficient HIV-1 replication. Following the \n\n incubation, the cells were stained with the tetrazolium dye XTT and read at 460/650 nm on a spectrophotometer to evaluate cellular viability. Efficacy and toxicity values were calculated using linear regression analysis. The efficacy of compound Il-a was compared to that of dolutegravir. The EC50 of compound II-a was in a range of 0.070 - 0.02 nM (e.g. 0.070, 0.075, 0.080, 0.085, 0.090, 0.095, 0.010, 0.015 or 0.02 nM) </p><img id=\"imgf000031_0001\" path=\"imgf000031_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/717614684/WO/20200423/A1/002020/08/11/43/imgf000031_0001.tif\"/></p>EXEMPLARY COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING THE COMPOUND II AND/OR </p> DERIVATIVES AND METHODS OF ADMINISTERING THE COMPOUND II OR DERIVATIVE COMPOSITIONS </p> Provided herein are compositions comprising at least one compound II as described herein, and methods of administering the same to treat e.g. HIV, influenza, etc. Implementation of the methods generally involves identifying patients suffering from or at risk of developing a disease or condition described herein (for example HIV), and administering a composition as described herein by an appropriate route. The exact dosage to be administered may vary depending on the age, gender, weight and overall health status of the individual patient, or on other treatments being received by the patient, as well as the extent or progression of the disease condition being treated and the precise etiology of the disease. However, in general for administration to mammals (e.g. humans), sufficient composition is administered to achieve compound II or derivative dosages in the range of from about 0.1 to about 60mg or more per kg of body weight per 24 hr., and preferably about 0.1 to about 30mg of compound II or derivative per kg of body weight per "
