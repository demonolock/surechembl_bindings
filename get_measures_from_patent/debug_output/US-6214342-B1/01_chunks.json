    "ossible to show low rates of early graft rejection by a two-stage treatment comprising initially the use of polyclonal antilymphocyte antibodies and than of CsA as principal maintenance immunosuppressant (A. J. Richardson at al., Transplant Internat 1990; 3: 26-31\u2014B. G. Sommer et al., Transplantation 1987; 43: 85-90).</p>The introduction of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) having defined Specificity has made it possible to envisage a more precise action in term of induction of immunosuppression and treatment of rejection episodes. At the present time, only the antibody OKT3 (anti-CD3 mAb) has received a marketing authorization for the curative treatment of renal transplant rejection episodes (Ortho-clone OKT\u00ae3, Product Information, Physicians' Desk Reference, 43rd edition (Medical Economics Company Inc., N. J. Oradell, 1989, pages 1500-1501). However, only limited evidence of its efficacy in preventing kidney transplant rejection (in combination with a chemical immunosuppression) is available. For the moment, no monoclonal antibody has been recognized for this indication.</p>The LFA-1 molecule (lymphocyte function-related molecule) in an integrin which belongs to the lymphocyte adhesion complex involved in the phenomena of cellular adhesion and intercellular communication and which enhances, in particular, interactions between helper lymphocytes and their target cells. This family of products includes the Mac-1, LFA-1 and Gp150,95 molecules which possess a common beta chain of 95 kD and differ from one another in their alpha chain. The LFA-1 or CD11a/CD18 protein is a dimer of 180 kD present at the surface of bone marrow cells (leucocytic lines), T lymphocytes, NK cells, polymorphonuclear leucocytes and macrophages/monocytes. In vitro, monoclonal antibodies directed against LFA-1 inhibit most of the activities of T cells.</p>Anti-LFA-1 antibody has been used in children for the transplantation of HLA-incompatible bone marrow (A. Fischer et al., Lancet 1986; ii, (8515): 1058-1061\u2014N. Perez et al., Bone Marrow Transplant 1989; 4: 379-384). Anti-LFA-1 antibodies have also been used in adult leukaemia patients for preventing an HLA-induced T cell-depleted bone marrow transplant rejection (D. Maraninchi et al., Bone Marrow Transplant 1989; 4: 147-150). They have also been used to treat 10 patients displaying an acute graft-versus-host reaction resistant to steroid treatments (A. M. Stoppa et al., Transplant Int. 1991; 4: 3-7).</p>In relation to renal transplantation, anti-LFA-1 monoclonal antibodies have been used in seven patients for treating episodes of acute transplant rejection (B. Le Mauff et al., Transplantation 1991; 52 (2); 291-296). The antibody used was the monoclonal antibody designated 25.3. Tolerance was good in the six patients who received more than one administration of this antibody. Infections were reported in two patients. However, only one patient, probably the one who experienced the weakest episode of rejection, regained his renal function before rejection, and a back-up treatment had to be instituted in five of them.
