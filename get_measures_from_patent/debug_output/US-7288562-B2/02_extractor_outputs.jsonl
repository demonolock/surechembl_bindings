{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nThe IC<sub>50 </sub>&amp; Kd were estimated by using the non-linear curve fitting program using G Pad Prism software. \nKi=IC<sub>50</sub>/(1+L/Kd), where L is the concentration of [<sup>3</sup>H]NMS used in the particular experiment.\n\n\nNote that there are only two sentences that contain all four required components: a specific molecule name/identifier is not explicitly mentioned, but the context suggests that the metrics are related to the compounds being tested, particularly in the context of muscarinic receptor subtypes. However, without a specific molecule name, these sentences may not fully meet the criteria. If you would like to extract more context or clarify the requirements, please let me know."}
