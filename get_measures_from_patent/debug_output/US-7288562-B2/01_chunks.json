The tissues were homogenised in 10 volumes of homogenising buffer and the homogenate was filtered through two layers of wet gauze and filtrate was centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min. The supernatant was subsequently centrifuged at 40,000 g for 20 min. The pellet thus obtained was resuspended in same volume of assay buffer (HEPES 20 mM, EDTA 5 mM, pH 7.4) and were stored at \u221270\u00b0 C. until the time of assay.</p>Ligand binding assay: The compounds were dissolved and diluted in DMSO. The membrane homogenates (150-250 \u03bcg protein) were incubated in 250 \u03bcl of assay buffer (HEPES 20 mM, pH 7.4) at 24-25\u00b0 C. for 3 h. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 1 \u03bcM atropine. The incubation was terminated by vacuum filtration over GF/B fiber filters(Wallac). The filters were then washed with ice cold 50 mM Tris HCl buffer (pH 7.4). The filter mats were dried and bound radioactivity retained on filters was counted. The IC<sub>50 </sub>&amp; Kd were estimated by using the non-linear curve fitting program using G Pad Prism software. The value of inhibition constant Ki was calculated from competitive binding studies by using Cheng &amp; Prusoff equation (Biochem Pharmacol, 1973, 22: 3099-3108), Ki=IC<sub>50</sub>/(1+L/Kd), where L is the concentration of</p>[<sup>3</sup>H]NMS used in the particular experiment.</p>Functional Experiments Using Isolated Rat Bladder:</p>Methodology:</p>Animals were euthanized by overdose of urethane and whole bladder was isolated and removed rapidly and placed in ice cold Tyrode buffer with the following composition (mMol/L) NaCl 137; KCl 2.7; CaCl<sub>2 </sub>1.8; MgCl<sub>2 </sub>0.1; NaHCO<sub>3 </sub>11.9; NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>0.4; Glucose 5.55 and continuously gassed with 95% O<sub>2 </sub>and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>The bladder was cut into longitudinal strips (3 mm wide and 5-6 mm long) and mounted in 10 ml organ baths at 30\u00b0 C., with one end connected to the base of the tissue holder and the other end connected to a polygraph through a force displacement transducer. Each tissue was maintained at a constant basal tension of 2 g and allowed to equilibrate for 1 hour during which the PSS was changed every 15 min. At the end of equilibration period the stabilization of the tissue contractile response was assessed with 1 \u03bcmol/L of Carbachol consecutively for 2-3 times. Subsequently a cumulative concentration response curve to carbachol (10<sup>\u22129 </sup>mol/L to 3\u00d710<sup>\u22125 </sup>mol/L) was obtained. After several washes, once the baseline was achieved, cumulative concentration response curve was obtained in presence of NCE (NCE added 20 min. prior to the second CRC).</p>The contractile results were expressed as % of control E max.
