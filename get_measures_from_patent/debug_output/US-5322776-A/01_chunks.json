    "GROUND OF THE INVENTIONLeukotrienes and prostaglandins are important mediators of inflammation. Leukotrienes recruit inflammatory cells such as neutrophils to an inflamed site, promote the extravasation of these cells and stimulate release of superoxide and proteases which damage the tissue. Leukotrienes also play a pathophysiological role in the hypersensitivity experienced by asthmatics [See, e.g. B. Samuelson et al., Science, 237:1171-76 (1987)]. Prostaglandins enhance inflammation by increasing blood flow and therefore infiltration of leukocytes to inflamed sites. Prostaglandins also potentiate the pain response induced by stimuli. prostaglandins and leukotrienes are unstable and are not stored in cells, but are instead synthesized [W. L. Smith, Biochem. J., 259:315-324 (1989) from arachidonic acid in response to stimuli. Likewise arachidonic acid is not free in cells but is released from the sn-2 position of membrane phospholipids by Phospholipase A2 (hereinafter PLA<sub>2</sub>). The reaction catalyzed by PLA<sub>2</sub> is believed to represent the rate-limiting step in the process of lipid mediator biosynthesis. When the phospholipid substrate of PLA<sub>2</sub> is of the phosphatidyl choline class with an ether linkage in the sn-1 position, the lysophospholipid produced is the immediate precursor of platelet activating factor (hereafter called PAF), another potent mediator of inflammation [S. I. Wasserman, Hospital practice, 15:49-58 (1988)]. Consequently the direct inhibition of the activity of PLA<sub>2</sub> has been suggested as a useful mechanism for a therapeutic agent, i.e., to interfere with the inflammatory response. [See, e.g., J. Chang et al, Biochem. Pharmacol., 36:2429-2436 (1987)].</p>A family of PLA<sub>2</sub> enzymes characterized by the presence of a secretion signal sequenced and ultimately secreted from the cell have been sequenced and structurally defined. These secreted PLA<sub>2</sub> 's are approximately 14 kD molecular weight and contain seven disulfide bonds which are necessary for activity. These PLA<sub>2</sub> s are found in large quantities in mammalian pancreas, bee venom, and various snake venom. [See, e.g., references 13-15 in Chang et al, cited above; and E. A. Dennis, Drug Devel. Res., 10:205-220 (1987).]However, the pancreatic enzyme is believed to serve a digestive function and, as such, should not be important in the production of the inflammatory mediators whose production must be tightly regulated.</p>Recently, the primary structure of the first human non-pancreatic PLA<sub>2</sub> has been determined. This non-pancreatic PLA<sub>2</sub> is found in platelets, synovial fluid, and spleen and is also a secreted enzyme. This enzyme is a member of the aforementioned family. [See, J. J. Seilhamer et al, J. Biol. Chem., 264:5335-5338 (1989); R. M. Kramer et al, J. Biol. Chem., 264:5768-5775 (1989); and A. Kando et al, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm., 163:42-48 (1989)].</p>However, it is doubtful that this enzyme is important in the synthesis of prostaglandins, leukotrienes and PAF, since the non-pancreatic PLA<sub>2</sub> is an extracellular protein which would be difficult to regulate, and the next enzymes in the biosynthetic pathways for these compounds are intracellular proteins. Moreover, there is evidence that PLA<sub>2</sub> is regulated by protein kinase C and G proteins [R. Burch and J. Axelrod, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 84:6374-6378 (1989)] which are cytosolic proteins which must act on intracellular proteins. It would be impossible for the non-pancreatic PLA2 to function in the cytosol, since the high reduction potential would reduce the disulfide bonds and inactivate the enzyme.</p>A murine PLA<sub>2</sub> has recently been identified in the murine macrophage cell line, designated RAW 264.7. A specific activity of 2 \u03bcmols/min/mg, resistant to reducing conditions, was reported to be associated with the approximately 60 kD molecule. However, this protein was not purified to homogeneity. [See, C. C. Leslie et al, Biochem. Biophys. Acta., 963:476-492 (1988)]. The references cited above are incorporated by reference herein for information pertaining to the function of the phospholipase enzymes, particularly PLA<sub>2</sub>.</p>There remains a need in the art for a definitive identification of an intracellular PLA<sub>2</sub> enzyme, purified from its natural source or otherwise produced in purified form, which functions intracellularly to produce arachidonic acid in response to inflammatory stimuli. Such enzymes may be useful in methods for developing effective anti-inflammatory agents for therapeutic use in a variety of disease states.</p>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIn one aspect the present invention provides a first well-defined intracellular and biologically active mammalian PLA<sub>2</sub> enzyme which is substantially free from association with other mammalian proteins. A novel human biologically active enzyme is characterized by containing all or a portion of the same or substantially the same amino acid sequence reported below in Table I. Alternatively, DNA sequences capable of hybridizing to the sequence of Table I may encode the enzyme.</p>In another aspect, there is disclosed a second novel mammalian biologically active PLA<sub>2</sub> enzyme characterized by containing all or a portion of the same or substantially the same amino acid sequence reported below in Table II. The partial DNA sequence encoding this novel enzyme is reported in Table II. Alternatively, DNA sequences capable of hybridizing to the sequence of Table II may encode the enzyme.</p>The mammalian PLA<sub>2</sub> enzymes of this invention are further characterized by each having an apparent molecular weight of approximately 110 kD as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. These enzymes are further characterized by resistance to dithiothreitol, indicating that little to no disulfide bonds exist in the structures of the active homogenous enzymes.</p>The PLA<sub>2</sub> enzymes of this invention have displayed enzymatic activity in the mixed micelle assay, with a specific activity of 20 \u03bcmols/min/mg associated with the 110 kD protein. This activity is not affected by incubation with disulfide reducing agents. The activity indicates the function of the homogenous enzymes of this invention as cytosolic phospholipase enzymes, involved in regulating the prostaglandin and leukotriene pathways, as well as the biosynthesis of platelet activating factor (PAF).</p>Another aspect of the invention includes novel DNA sequence coding on expression for a mammalian PLA<sub>2</sub> enzyme. The enzyme may be encoded by the DNA sequence reported in Table I, a fragment thereof or a sequence capable of hybridizing thereto. The enzyme may be encoded by the DNA sequence reported in Table II, a fragment thereof or a sequence capable of hybridizing thereto.</p>Also provided by the present invention are vectors containing a DNA sequence encoding a mammalian PLA<sub>2</sub> enzyme in operative association with an expression control sequence. Host cells transformed with such vectors for use in producing recombinant PLA<sub>2</sub> are also provided by the present invention.</p>The vectors and transformed cells of the invention are employed in another aspect, a novel process for producing recombinant mammalian PLA<sub>2</sub> enzyme. In this process a cell line transformed with a DNA sequence encoding on expression for PLA<sub>2</sub> enzyme in operative association with an expression control sequence therefore is cultured. This claimed process may employ a number of known cells as host cells for expression of the polypep",
    " Culture Collection, 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Md. (ATCC) under accession number ATCC CRL 1593. The U937 cell line was chosen due to its high levels of PLA<sub>2</sub> activity, even in the presence of disulfide reducing agents. However, PLA<sub>2</sub> may also be produced by other human cell lines.</p>The purification procedure is described in detail in Example 1 below. Briefly described, cells were disrupted by N<sub>2</sub> cavitation in a pH 7.5 iso-osmotic lysis buffer containing dithiothreitol (DTT), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and protease inhibitors. The 100,000\u00d7 g supernatant was purified by elution through the following order of chromatographic columns: phenyl, heparin, hydroxyapatite, size exclusion and anion exchange chromatography. DTT, a disulfide reducing agent, was added to the elution buffers to inactivate any low molecular weight PLA<sub>2</sub> s. In this manner, selection was directed to purification of cytosolic PLA<sub>2</sub>.</p>At this point of the purification, the human PLA<sub>2</sub> enzyme preparation is characterized by a specific activity of approximately 4 \u03bcmols/min/mg in the mixed micelle assay described in Example 3, below. This specific activity is comparable to that reported for the intracellular murine PLA<sub>2</sub> by Leslie et al, cited above.</p>However, when the purified protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, two major proteins were observed with apparent molecular weights of approximately 60 kD and 110 kD. The smaller protein was approximately 4-fold more abundant. Further purification on a size exclusion column separated the two proteins, with the activity remaining associated with the 110 kD protein. No activity was associated with the 60 kD protein.</p>The specific activity of the pure homogeneous material is estimated to be approximately 20 \u03bcmols/min/mg using the mixed micelle assay described in Example 3 to measure activity, and the intensity of the 110 kD band on a silver stained SDS-PAGE gel to quantitate protein.</p>The 110 kD protein was run on a SDS-PAGE gel, the region of the gel corresponding to 110 kD was excised and subjected to digestion by trypsin. The tryptic fragments were separated by C-8 reverse phase chromatography and the amino acid sequences were determined for several fragments. Degenerate oligonucleotides encoding two of these fragments were used to screen a cDNA library prepared from the U937 cell line, as described in Example 5.</p>One complete clone was sequenced. The PLA<sub>2</sub> cDNA sequence from this clone is shown in Table I below. The DNA sequence of Table I contains approximately 2247 nucleotides in the proper reading frame to encode a protein having a calculated molecular weight of approximately 85 kD.</p>Human PLA<sub>2</sub> according to this invention is characterized by the same or substantially the same approximately 749 predicted amino acid protein sequence (single letter code) encoded by that DNA sequence, as illustrated in Table I below. All tryptic fragments that were sequenced are present in the PLA<sub>2</sub> cDNA sequence and identified by underlining. Those tryptic fragments indicated by asterisks in the Table were used to design the oligonucleotides. Fragments of the sequence reported in Table I may also retain PLA<sub>2</sub> biological activity.</p>The cDNA sequence of Table I encodes biologically active human PLA<sub>2</sub>, based on detection of the functional polypeptides produced by mammalian cells. The active, recombinantly derived human PLA<sub>2</sub> migrates as an approximately 110 kD protein on SDS-PAGE, as does the purified enzyme. The cloned sequence of Table I in plasmid PMT-PLA<sub>2</sub> was deposited with the American Type Culture Collection, 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Md. on Feb. 27, 1990 under ATCC Accession No. 40759.</p>                                  TABLE I                                 \n__________________________________________________________________________\n ##STR1##                                                                 \n ##STR2##                                                                 \n ##STR3##                                                                 \n ##STR4##                                                                 \n ##STR5##                                                                 \n ##STR6##                                                                 \n ##STR7##                                                                 \n ##STR8##                                                                 \n ##STR9##                                                                 \n ##STR10##                                                                \n ##STR11##                                                                \n ##STR12##                                                                \n ##STR13##                                                                \n ##STR14##                                                                \n ##STR15##                             ",

The only factor with which the human PLA<sub>2</sub> sequence of Table I is believed to share significant sequence similarity is protein kinase C-gamma (PKC). This sequence similarity may indicate a region of PKC and PLA<sub>2</sub> which share a common function. Likely functions include the regulation of the two enzymes by calcium and the calcium dependent binding of these enzymes to membranes.</p>The second mammalian PLA<sub>2</sub> enzyme of this invention was originally purified from the murine monocytic cell line RAW 264.7, available from the ATCC under accession number TIB71. This factor may also be isolated from other murine cell lines. The methods used to isolate and purify the murine PLA<sub>2</sub> enzyme are analogous to those described above for the human PLA<sub>2</sub> from U937 cells and are described in detail in Example 2.</p>Like the human PLA<sub>2</sub> protein described above, the initially purified protein wa analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and two major proteins were observed having apparent molecular weights of approximately 60 kD and 110 kD. Further purification on a size exclusion column as described for human PLA<sub>2</sub> (also as described in Example 2 below) indicated that the 60 kD protein was an inactive contaminant and separated it from the active 110 kD protein. Once again, DTT was used to inactivate any low molecular weight PLA<sub>2</sub> enzymes.</p>The finally purified, homogeneous, approximately 110 kD murine PLA<sub>2</sub> enzyme of this invention is characterized by a specific activity of approximately 20 \u03bcmols/min/mg in the mixed micelle assay described in Example 3. The intensity of the 110 kD band on a silver stained SDS-PAGE gel was used to quantitate protein. This specific activity is 10-fold higher than that value observed by Leslie et al, cited above, for the 60 kD PLA<sub>2</sub> reportedly obtained from the same cell line. Due to the lower degree of purity obtained for the reported smaller molecular weight protein, it is likely that the 60 kD protein characterized as PLA<sub>2</sub> by Leslie et al is the contaminant of the 110 kD PLA<sub>2</sub> of this invention and, as such, does not possess PLA<sub>2</sub> activity.</p>To obtain production of this murine PLA<sub>2</sub> protein by recombinant methods, a sequence from a partial clone of the U937 PLA<sub>2</sub> (from base #877 to the 3' end of the sequence of Table I) was used to screen a cDNA library prepared from the RAW 264.7 cell line. One positive clone, which was isolated from a library of 1\u00d710<sup>6</sup>  clones, was partially sequenced. The partial sequence of the PLA<sub>2</sub> cDNA from this clone (clone #7) and the associated predicted amino acid sequence, is shown in Table II below. All or a fragment of this cDNA is believed to encode murine PLA<sub>2</sub> of this invention. The sequence determination of this clone is on-going.</p>The purified RAW 264.7 PLA<sub>2</sub> was also digested into tryptic fragments and sequenced as described for the human PLA<sub>2</sub> enzyme. The sequence of two tryptic fragments (underlined in the sequence of Table II) were obtained. DNA sequence was available for the first 15 of 18 amino acids of one of the tryptics, and this sequence is underlined in the table. The sequence for the other tryptic disagreed at two amino acids (marked by asterisks) within the deduced sequence. Based on the partial sequence, the RAW 264.7 enzyme is the murine homologue of the human PLA<sub>2</sub> of this invention.</p>Murine PLA<sub>2</sub> according to this invention is a protein comprising the same or substantially ",

Thus the present invention also encompasses these novel DNA sequences, free of association with DNA sequences encoding other mammalian proteins, and coding on expression for novel mammalian PLA<sub>2</sub> polypeptides.</p>DNA sequences of this invention also include those novel sequences which hybridize under stringent hybridization conditions [see, T. Maniatis et al, Molecular Cloning (A Laboratory Manual), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (1982), pages 387 to 389] to the DNA sequence of Table I or Table II. An example of one such stringent hybridization condition is hybridization in 4XSSC at 65\u00b0 C., followed by a washing in 0.1XSSC at 65\u00b0 C. for thirty minutes. Alternatively an exemplary stringent hybridization condition is in 50% formamide, 4XSSC at 42\u00b0 C.</p>DNA sequences, other than those of the known approximately 14 kD PLA<sub>2</sub> enzymes of pancreas or non-pancreatic origin, which hybridize to the sequences of Table I or II for human or murine PLA<sub>2</sub> under relaxed hybridization conditions and which code on expression for PLA<sub>2</sub> peptides having PLA<sub>2</sub> activity in the mixed micelle assay of Example 3, are also included in the present invention. Examples of such non-stringent hybridization conditions are 4XSSC at 50\u00b0 C. or hybridization with 30-40% formamide at 42\u00b0 C. For example, a DNA sequence which shares regions of significant homology, with the sequences of human or murine PLA<sub>2</sub> of this invention and encodes a protein having one or more PLA<sub>2</sub> biological properties clearly encodes a PLA<sub>2</sub> enzyme even if such a DNA sequence would not stringently hybridize to the human PLA<sub>2</sub> sequence of Table I or the murine PLA<sub>2</sub> sequence of Table II.</p>Similarly, DNA sequences which code for PLA<sub>2</sub> enzymes of this invention but which differ in codon sequence due to the degeneracies of the genetic code are also encompassed by this invention. Variations in the DNA sequence of PLA<sub>2</sub> which are caused by point mutations or by induced modifications of the sequences of Tables I and II, which enhance the activity, half-life or production of the polypeptides encoded thereby are also encompassed in the invention.</p>PLA<sub>2</sub> polypeptides may also be produced by known conventional chemical synthesis.

Vectors incorporating truncated or altered fragments of PLA<sub>2</sub>, allelic variants thereof, or modified sequences as described above are also embodiments of the present invention and useful in the production of PLA<sub>2</sub> polypeptides. The vector employed in the method also contains selected regulatory sequences in operative association with the DNA coding sequences of the invention and capable of directing the replication and expression thereof in selected host cells. The vector used in the examples below is a plasmid designed for expression of heterologous proteins in COS cells. This expression plasmid PMT-PLA<sub>2</sub> described in detail in Example 7.</p>The novel mammalian PLA<sub>2</sub> enzymes of this invention, purified to homogeneity from cell sources or produced recombinantly or synthetically, may be used in novel methods for screening compounds for anti-inflammatory activity, as described in Example 11. For example, a selected compound may be employed in the mixed micelle assay of Example 3 with a selected PLA<sub>2</sub> enzyme of this invention. If the normal action of the enzyme is inhibited, i.e., the phospholipid is not cleaved to release the inflammatory mediator precursor, e.g., fatty acid, the compound demonstrates potential as an inhibitor of inflammatory reaction.</p>Similarly the ability of the selected compound may be studied for inhibition of the PLA<sub>2</sub> activity in a liposome assay. An assay system utilizing natural membranes may also be designed to assess the anti-inflammatory potential of selected compounds. These assays are further described in Examples 3 and 11 below.</p>Alternatively a selected compound may be added to whole cells which overexpress the PLA<sub>2</sub> and the cells examined for inhibition of cleavage of the sn-2 acyl bond. For example, both normal cells and cells found to overexpress the PLA<sub>2</sub> enzyme are cultured in labelled arachidonic acid. Signal is measured between the secreted products of both the normal and overexpressing cells to provide a baseline of PLA<sub>2</sub> expression. A selected compound is then added to cultures and the cultures are grown in label arachidonic acid. If there is a difference in the signal (e.g., the amount of arachidonic acid produced) in the cells in the presence of the compound, it inhibited PLA<sub>2</sub> activity and may be a potential anti-inflammatory compound.</p>Other uses for these novel PLA<sub>2</sub> enzymes or active fragments thereof are in the development of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. Such antibodies may be generated employing PLA<sub>2</sub>, a fragment thereof, or a modified or allelic version thereof as an antigen. By using standard methods for the development of such antibodies known to one of skill in the art, polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies are made which may be useful as research or diagnostic agents to study PLA<sub>2</sub> and inflammatory functions directly.</p>A pharmaceutical preparation or formulation containing a compound identified by the screening method of the present invention to inhibit the function of PLA<sub>2</sub>, may be employed to treat, among other conditions, those disease states characterized by inflammatory reactions, e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, ",

When the 110 kD fraction was removed from the gel and this purified enzyme material was examined in the mixed micelle assay, the specific activity was found to be approximately 20 \u03bcmols/min/mg. The 60 kD band was found to be associated with no activity on the same assay.</p>EXAMPLE 2--PURIFICATION OF MURINE PLA<sub>2</sub>The murine monocytic cell line RAW 264.7 [ATCC TIB71] was selected as a potential source for murine intracellular PLA<sub>2</sub>. Using a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0 C. and 10% CO<sub>2</sub>, approximately 10<sup>10</sup> RAW 264.7 cells were cultured in DME media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/mL), streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/mL) and glutamine (20 mM). The cells were harvested by centrifugation.

The active fractions were concentrated in a Centricon-30 and injected onto a TSK-Gel G3000-SW size exclusion column (60 cm\u00d77.5 mm) which was both equilibrated and eluted with pH6.5 MES buffer (40 mM) containing KCl (300 mM), DTT (5 mM) and octylglucoside (3 mM). The flow rate Was 0.4 mL/minute, and the fraction size was 0.25 mL/minute.</p>When this fraction of purified enzyme material was examined in the mixed micelle assay described below, the specific activity was found to be approximately 20 \u03bcmols/min/mg. The activity eluted at a molecular weight of approximately 100 kD. Fractions from the sizing column were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using Biorad silver stain for visualization to confirm the purity of the preparation. The activity correlated with a 100 kD band.</p>EXAMPLE 3--ASSAYS FOR PLA<sub>2</sub> ENZYME ACTIVITYA Mixed Micelle AssayThe currently preferred method of assay for PLA<sub>2</sub> activity is the mixed micelle assay using 1-palmitoyl 2-[1-<sup>14</sup> C] arachidonoyl phosphatidylcholine as substrate and Triton as the micelle forming detergent. This assay is performed as follows:</p>1-Palmitoyl 2-[1-<sup>14</sup> C] arachidonoyl phosphatidylcholine (50 nmol; 200,000 dpm) is dried under nitrogen and then resuspended in 0.5 mL glycine buffer (80 mM) at pH9.0 containing Triton (200 \u03bcM), CaCl<sub>2</sub> (5 mM), fatty acid free bovine serum albumin (250 \u03bcg/mL) and glycerol (70%). The suspension is sonicated to form mixed micelles of phospholipid and Triton.</p>Aliquots of PLA<sub>2</sub> protein solution to be assayed are added to the mixed micelle solution and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. in a shaking water bath. After a defined time period, the reaction is quenched by the addition of 2.5 mL of isopropanol, heptane, and 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub> SO: (800:200:40) with brief vortexing. Heptane (1.5 mL) and water (1.0 mL) are added and the solution is vortexed for 10 seconds.</p>The solution separates into an upper phase of heptane, which contains the [1-<sup>14</sup> C] arachidonic acid liberated by PLA<sub>2</sub>, plus a small fraction of unreacted substrate, and a lower isopropanol/aqueous phase which contains the bulk of the unreacted substrate. One milliliter of the heptane phase is loaded on a silica column (200 mg) and el",
    "ine is retained. The eluate is mixed with scintillant and the radioactivity measured.</p>This assay may be performed using various concentrations of the components, alternative phospholipids, different detergents or divalent metals, and a range of pH.</p>B. Liposome AssayFor the performance of a liposome assay, the same procedure as described for the micelle assay is performed, except detergent is not used. In this case, the phospholipid forms a liposome, instead of a mixed micelle. All the variations mentioned above may increase the sensitivity of the enzyme to inhibitors. This form of the assay may also be employed to detect activity of compounds to inhibit PLA<sub>2</sub>.</p>C. Natural Cell Membrane AssayAs an alternative source of substrate, natural cell membranes may be isolated, and freed of endogenous PLA<sub>2</sub> by EDTA extraction or repeated freeze-thaw cycles. The membranes are then added to exogenous PLA<sub>2</sub>. The free fatty acids resulting from the PLA<sub>2</sub> activity may be detected by gas chromatography.</p>EXAMPLE 4--PROTEIN SEQUENCE ANALYSIS OF HUMAN PLA<sub>2</sub>Human PLA<sub>2</sub> from fractions 39 and 40 from the Mono-Q HR 5/5 column and the active fractions from the second sizing column in Example 1 were combined and run on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel. As a reference, a small aliquot of the sample was iodinated with <sup>125</sup> I and run out on the gel with the rest of the sample. The region of the gel corresponding to molecular weight 110 kD, as determined by autoradiography, was excised and digested by catalytic amounts of trypsin (2% w/w).</p>The resulting tryptic peptides were separated by reverse-phase chromatography on a Vydac C-4 column using a linear gradient of acetonitrile on 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at 1% acetonitrile per minute. Eluted proteins were monitored by UV absorbance at 214 and 280 nm.</p>Several peptides were subjected to automated gas phase microsequencing:</p>(1) G S T M E E E L E N I T T K</p>(2) I Y E P L D V</p>(3) M N K</p>(4) I D P Y V F D</p>(5) K Y K A p G V P</p>(6) E A M V E S I E Y</p>Active fractions from the RAW 264.7 PLA<sub>2</sub> material purified as in Example 2 were sequenced in an analogous fashion.</p>EXAMPLE 5--cDNA LIBRARY CONSTRUCTION AND SCREENINGcDNA libraries are synthesized from polyadenylated RNA from the human U937 genomic cell line and the RAW 264.7 cell lines, respectively, and cloned into lambda ZAP [Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, Calif.] essentially as described in J. J. Toole et al, Nature, 312:342-347 (1984)] with the following exceptions: the adapters used to blunt-end ligate to the double-stranded cDNA have the sequence 5' CTCTAGAGTCCACGG 3' and 3' GAGATCTCAGCTGCCTTAA 5'.</p>For probing the human cDNA, a portion of the tryptic peptide (1) above (amino acid sequence M E E E L E) was used to design a pool of 48-fold degenerate oligonucleotides of 17 bases. An overlapping portion of tryptic (1) above (amino acid sequence E L E N I T) was also used to design a 140-fold degenerate anti-sense oligonucleotide. The tryptic peptide (5) above (amino acid sequence K Y K A P G) was used to design a 96-fold oligonucleotide. The synthetic pools contained all possible coding sequences for the listed peptides, and were used to screen 300,000 recombinant bacteriophage by the method of K. Jacobs et al, Nature, 313:806-810 (1985).</p>One human clone, designated clone 38, was shown to hybridize with all three oligonucleotides. Clone 38 was a partial clone, lacking the coding region for the amino-terminal 292 amino acids. THis partial clone was used to screen 1,200,000 recombinant bacteriophage using the protocol described in M. Katan et al, Cell, 54:171-177  (1988). Two bacteriophage, clones 1 and 19 contained approximately 3 kb cDNA inserts which were of sufficient length to encode a 110 kD protein. The sequence for both cones were determined for both strands using a Bal31 nuclease deletion series protocol [Poncz et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci USA, 79:4298-4302 (1982)] with subsequent subcloning into appropriate M13 vectors [Messing and Viera, Gene, 19:269-276 (1982)] followed by sequence determination as described by Sanger et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 74:5463-5467 (1977). This analysis indicated that clone 19 encodes a protein of 85,000 daltons molecular weight that contains all of the tryptic peptides identified by protein sequencing. Clone 1 was identical in the coding region to clone 19 with the exception of a one base deletion.</p>Clone 19 is the source of the DNA and predicted amino acid sequence of Table I above.</p>EXAMPLE 6--PREPARATION OF RECOMBINANT mPLA<sub>2</sub>Essentially the same procedures described above were employed to recombinant murine PLA<sub>2</sub>. A sequence from clone 19 of Table I (from base #877 to the 3' end of the sequence of Table I) was used to screen the RAW 264.7  cDNA library. Clone 7, which was isolated from a library of 1\u00d710<sup>6</sup> clones, was partially sequenced as shown in Table II.</p>The purified RAW 264.7 PLA<sub>2</sub> was digested into tryptic fragments and sequenced as described for the human PLA<sub>2</sub> enzyme. The sequence of two tryptic fragments were obtained: (6) G T F G D M L D T P D P Y V E and (7) E N E E A E K E Y Q S D N Q A. The sequence for tryptic (7) disagreed at two amino acids with"
