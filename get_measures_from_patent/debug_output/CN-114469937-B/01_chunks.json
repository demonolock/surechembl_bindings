    "3) 1uL of inhibitor (PF-05231023, concentration of 0,0.05mM,0.1mM,0.25mM,0.5mM,1mM,2.5 mM) was added to the solution obtained in the above step (2) respectively;</p>4) Adding 1uL of substrate peptide (0.5 mM) with the same concentration into the solution obtained in the step (3), incubating at 37 \u2103 by using a fluorescence microplate reader, monitoring fluorescence emission value at 496nm by using the fluorescence microplate reader, and incubating for 1h while detecting;</p>5) Fluorescence emission values at 496nm were counted for 342nm excitation before and after incubation of each group. The fluorescence change before and after incubation of the control group (inhibitor concentration 0 group) was taken as 100, and the fluorescence change before and after incubation of the different inhibition groups was compared to obtain the residual activity value (Residual Activity). The inhibition of the compound, expressed as the concentration of inhibitor at half inhibition of enzyme activity, was obtained using GraphPad Prism6 software, plotted on the logarithmic scale of inhibitor concentration (logC (Inhibitor)) and the corresponding residual activity value (Residual Activity) on the ordinate, as shown in fig. 2, and the results are shown in fig. 2, which show the ratio of different inhibitor concentrations to inhibition of enzyme activity. Table 1 lists the activity data of compound PF-05231023 against SARS-Cov-2 3CLpro inhibition.</p>Table 1 Structure of Compounds PF-05231023 and IC50 values for inhibiting novel coronavirus 3C-like proteases</p></p>It can be seen that the above compounds have very obvious inhibitory effect on novel coronavirus 3C-like protease, and IC <sub>50</sub> A value of 2.339. Mu.M indicates that PF-05231023 was effective in inhibiting the activity of novel coronavirus 3C-like protease. Furthermore, based on sequence analysis, coronavirus 3C-like proteases have a high similarity, and therefore, such compounds are also capable of effectively inhibiting the activity of other coronavirus 3C-like proteases, especially for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1.</p>IC <sub>50</sub> The formula for the calculation is y=100/(1+10 ((X-LogIC 50))), where Y represents the remaining activity fraction, X represents the usual logarithm of the concentration of inhibitor compound, \u039b refers to the power algorithm.</p>The previous description of the disclosed embodiments is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to make or use the present invention.
