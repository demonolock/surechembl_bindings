BACKGROUND The complement system plays a central role in the clearance of immune complexes and in immune responses to infectious agents, foreign antigens, virus-infected cells, and tumor cells. Complement activation occurs primarily by three pathways: the classical pathway, the lectin pathway, and the alternative pathway. The alternative pathway of complement is in a constant state of low-level activation. Uncontrolled activation or insufficient regulation of the complement alternative pathway (CAP) can lead to inflammation, cellular injury, and tissue damage. Local alternative pathway activation within the kidney is a contributor to renal pathology and loss of function. Thus, the complement alternative pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of renal diseases. Inhibition or modulation of complement alternative pathway activity, in the absence of initiation of the lectin and classical pathway, has been recognized as a promising therapeutic strategy. For example, the alternative pathway plays a role in amplifying complement activation initiated from all three pathways. The number of treatment options available for diseases associated with the complement alternative pathway are limited. Thus, developing innovative strategies to treat diseases associated with complement alternative pathway activation or dysregulation, such as kidney diseases, which affect an estimated 37 million people in the U.S. alone, is a significant unmet need. SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE Described herein are fusion polypeptides that include a Factor H catalytic domain.

Definitions As used herein, the term \u201cabout\u201d refers to a value that is within 10% above or below the value being described. As used herein, \u201cadministering\u201d and \u201cadministration\u201d refer to any method of providing a pharmaceutical preparation to a subject. Fusion proteins may be administered by any method known to those skilled in the art. Suitable methods for administering the fusion protein may be, for example, orally, by injection (e.g., intravenously, intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, intravitreally, and subcutaneously), drop infusion preparations, inhalation, intranasally, and the like. In some embodiments, administration is via intravenous and/or subcutaneous infusions. Fusion proteins prepared, as described herein, may be administered in various forms depending on the disorder to be treated and the age, condition, and body weight of the subject, as is known in the art. A preparation can be administered prophylactically; that is, administered to decrease the likelihood of developing a disease or condition. As used herein, the terms \u201cbinding affinity,\u201d \u201cspecifically binds,\u201d \u201caffinity\u201d refer to the strength of the total noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule and its binding partner. Unless otherwise indicated, as used herein, \u201cbinding affinity\u201d refers to intrinsic binding affinity, which reflects a specific interaction between members of a binding pair. The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (Kd). Affinity can be measured by standard methods known in the art, including those described herein. A low- affinity complex contains a molecule that generally tends to dissociate readily from its binding partner, whereas a high-affinity complex contains a molecule that generally tends to remain bound to its binding partner for a longer duration. \u201cSpecifically binds\u201d refers to molecules and binding partner pairs that have a Kd of at least 1x10<sup>-6</sup> M or lower (e.g., in the range of 1x10<sup>-6</sup> M to 1x10<sup>-12</sup> M, such as 1x10<sup>-7</sup> M, 1x10<sup>-8</sup> M, 1x10<sup>-9</sup> M, 1x10<sup>-10</sup> M, 1x10<sup>-11</sup> M, and 1x10<sup>-12</sup> M). As used herein, the term \u201cantibody\u201d refers to an immunoglobulin molecule that specifically or substantially specifically binds to, or is immunologically reactive with, a particular antigen. The antibody can be, for example, a natural or artificial mono- or polyvalent antibody including, but not limited to, a polyclonal, monoclonal, multi-specific, human, humanized, or chimeric antibody. An antibody may be a genetically engineered or otherwise modified form of an antibody, including but not limited to, heteroconjugate antibodies (e.g., bi-, tri-, and tetra-specific antibodies, diabodies, \n\ntriabodies, and tetrabodies), and antigen binding fragments of antibodies, including, for example, single domain, VHH, Fab', F(ab')<sub>2</sub>, Fab, Fv, rlgG and scFv fragments. As used herein, the term \u201ccomplement alternative pathway\u201d refers to one of three pathways of complement activation (the others being the classical pathway and the lectin pathway). As used herein, the term \u201ccomplement alternative pathway activation or dysregulation\u201d refers to any aberration in the ability of the complement alternative pathway to provide host defense against pathogens and clear immune complexes and damaged cells for immunoregulation. Complement alterna",
    "he polymer. The term polynucleotide, as used herein, refers interchangeably to double- and single-stranded molecules. Unless otherwise specified or required, any embodiment of the disclosure described herein that is a \n\ndouble-stranded polynucleotide encompasses both the double-stranded form and each of the two complementary single-stranded forms known or predicted to make up the double-stranded form. As used herein, the terms \u201cshort complement regulator\u201d, or \u201cSCR\u201d, also known as \u201cshort consensus repeat\u201d, \u201csushi domains,\u201d or \u201ccomplement control protein\u201d or \u201cCCP,\u201d describe domains found in all regulators of complement activation (RCA) gene clusters that contribute to their ability to regulate complement activation in the blood or on the cell surface to which they specifically bind. SCRs typically are composed of about 60 amino acids, with four cysteine residues disulfide bonded in a 1-3, 2-4 arrangement and a hydrophobic core built around an almost invariant tryptophan residue. SCRs are found in proteins including, but not limited to, factor H and FHRP5. As used herein, the terms \u201csingle domain antibody\u201d and \u201cVHH\u201d define molecules formed by a single immunoglobulin domain. Single domain antibodies include antibodies whose complementary determining regions (\u201cCDRs\u201d) are part of a single domain polypeptide. Single domain antibodies often include an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof that specifically binds a single antigen (e.g., the VHH antibody binds an antigen with a KD of 1x10<sup>-6</sup> M or lower, e.g., a KD in the range of 1x10<sup>-6</sup> M to 1x10<sup>-12</sup> M, such as a KD of 1x10<sup>-7</sup> M, 1x10<sup>-8</sup> M, 1x10<sup>-9</sup> M, 1x10<sup>-10</sup> M, 1x10<sup>-11</sup> M, and 1x10<sup>-12</sup> M). Generally, the antigen binding site of an immunoglobulin single variable domain is formed by no more than three CDRs. The single variable domain may, for example, include a light chain variable domain sequence (a VL sequence) or a suitable fragment thereof; or a heavy chain variable domain sequence (e.g., a VH sequence or VHH sequence), or a suitable fragment thereof. Such antibodies can be derived, for example, from antibodies raised in Camelidae species, for example, in a camel, dromedary, llama, alpaca, or guanaco. Additional antibodies include, for example, immunoglobulin new antigen receptor (IgNAR) of cartilaginous fishes (e.g., sharks, e.g., nurse sharks). Other species besides Camelidae and cartilaginous fishes may produce antibodies whose CDRs are part of a single polypeptide. Antibodies can be prepared by either synthetic or recombinant techniques known in the art. As used herein, the term \"subject\" refers to any animal (e.g., a mammal), including, but not limited to, humans, non-human primates, rodents, and the like, which is to be the recipient of a particular treatment. Typically, the terms \"subject\" and \"patient\" are used interchangeably herein in reference to a human subject. By \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d is meant the amount of a composition administered to improve, inhibit, or ameliorate a condition of a subject, o",
    "ound D, Compound E, Compound F, Compound G, Compound H, Compound I, Compound J, Compound K Compound L, Compound M, Compound N, and Compound O (e.g., a fusion protein having the amino acid sequence of any one of SEQ ID Nos: 1-15) or a variant thereof (e.g., a fusion protein having at least 85% sequence identity to any one of SEQ ID Nos :1-15) for the manufacture of a medicament for ischemia reperfusion injury. \n\n EXAMPLES The following examples are put forth so as to provide those of ordinary skill in the art with a disclosure and description of how the methods and compounds claimed herein are performed, made. They are intended to be purely exemplary and are not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure. Example 1. In silico design and construction of kidney-localizing Factor H fusion proteins Constructs including various combinations of the Factor H N-terminus functional domain, a VHH domain and a poly-arginylglycylaspartic acid (RGD) domain were designed in silico. Exemplary constructs are illustrated in Figures 1A and 1B. The amino acid sequences of the constructs shown in Figs.1A and 1B were provided to GeneArt (ThermoFisher) for codon optimization and gene synthesis. Nucleotide sequences were cloned into a proprietary vector for expression in mammalian cells. Plasmid DNA was then transiently transfected into HEK293 and CHO cells. After 4-5 days, supernatants were harvested. The concentrations of fusion proteins were determined by SDS-PAGE and densitometry. Example 2. Inhibition of the alternative pathway using fusion proteins Compounds according to the disclosure were tested for their ability to inhibit the alternative pathway using the CAP-specific hemolytic assay. Results are shown in Fig.2A, 2B, 2C, and 2D. Briefly, rabbit red blood cells were washed and added to 10% human serum containing Mg<sup>2+</sup> and EGTA. Serial dilutions of inhibitors were added, and the cells were incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Cells were removed by centrifugation and the amount of cell lysis was determined by measuring the absorbance of the supernatant at 415 nm. Inhibition of the alternative pathway lysis was shown for all molecules tested, confirming that the molecules were functional as expected. Example 3. Visualization of fusion proteins in the kidney In vivo imaging of fluorescently-labeled constructs was performed in female J:NU outbred nude mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME). Figure 3 shows representative longitudinal in vivo imaging in the same subject acquired over a period of 4 days. For image acquisition, subjects were maintained under 2-3% isoflurane anesthesia on the warmed imaging platform within the IVIS Spectrum Imaging System (PerkinElmer Inc., Waltham, MA). Fluorescent imaging analysis was performed using Living Image 4.5.1 software (PerkinElmer Inc., Waltham, MA), with automatic 2D epi- illumination exposure settings, field of view (FOV) C, F/Stop 2, medium binning and 800nm emission/750nm excitation filters. Subjects received 1 mg/kg of AlexaFluor 750-labeled test article via volume-normalized 100 \u00b5L intravenous tail vein injection. All animal studies were conducted according to provisions of the Animal Welfare Act and the principles of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All procedures were approved by the IACUC at Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., New Haven, CT, protocol #917103. Figure 3 also shows the kidney from the same mouse imaged via fluorescent microscopy. The signal shows biodistribution of the tested compound, with selectivity for the apical side of parietal \n\nand proximal tubul",
    "ia standard techniques. Figure 17 shows Compound E at time zero, day 3, day 7, and day 14. The profiles were all similar, confirming the stability of Compound E. Similar results were obtained for the compounds Compound D and Compound G. Example 18. Characterization of binding of fusion proteins to C3b Binding of the compounds to C3b was assessed by bio-layer interferometry (BLI). Biotinylated C3b was immobilized to streptavidin biosensor tips and exposed to analytes of molar- equivalent concentrations diluted in kinetics buffer. Figure 18A shows expected binding profiles of Compound E and Compound K as compared to non-binding controls (reference protein 11, which is an anti-C5 VHH reference protein used as a negative control, and reference protein 6, which is an anti-HSA factor H-VHH fusion protein used as a positive control) represented by shifts in optical thickness on the sensor tips. Figure 18B shows a 40-second, blown-up section of the binding curve of Figure 18A, in which the t = 0 seconds timepoint on Figure 18B corresponds to the t = 720 seconds timepoint on Figure 18A. These results confirm the binding of the compounds to C3b. \n\nExample 19. Measuring effect of fusion protein on complement alternative pathway regulation Regulation of the complement alternative pathway (CAP) in normal human serum (NHS) by Compound E was assessed according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions in the Complement system Alternative Pathway WIESLAB<sup>\u00ae</sup> assay. A comparable, dose-dependent inhibition of the C5b-9 neoantigen expressed during MAC formation was observed across two tested lots of NHS under otherwise identical conditions, as shown in Figure 19. Example 20. Pharmacokinetic assessment of Compound E in wild-type mice Single-dose pharmacokinetic exposures were determined for Compound E across a range of subcutaneous (SC) doses in wild-type male C57Bl/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME). Figure 20 shows composite data from two separate studies illustrating dose-dependent pharmacokinetics of Compound E administered at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg. Serum exposures were measured by LC-MS/MS. Example 21. Pharmacokinetic assessment of Compound E in cynomolgus monkeys Single-dose pharmacokinetic exposures were determined for Compound E across a range of intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) doses in female cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis) monkeys (Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Mattawan, MI). Figure 21A shows serum pharmacokinetics of Compound E following both an initial dose given on study day 0 and a fourth dose administered on study day 12. Figure 21B includes the data from Figure 21A re-plotted to compare equivalent dose levels given by IV or SC route of administration. Serum exposures were measured by LC-MS/MS.
