Human PBMCs were isolated from human blood samples by standard Ficoll-Paque\u2122 plus (GE HEALTHCARE) density gradient centrifugation methods, and primary naive CD4 T cells were isolated from the PBMC suspension by negative selection according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (StemCell). Isolated human primary naive CD4 T cells were resuspended at 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL and plated in polystyrene 96-well, u-bottom plates in complete medium (RPMI-1640 containing 10% Fetal bovine serum, IX MEM-nonessential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, IX penicillin-streptomycin solution (all from Corning\u00ae) and IX GlutaMAX\u2122 (Gibco\u2122), 0.1% p-mercaptoethanol (LIFE TECHNOLOGIES). Exemplified anti -human MCT1 antibodies or isotype control antibodies were added at different concentrations. Cells were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 dymane beads (Gibco) and hrTGFb (R&amp;D) and hrIL-2 (R&amp;D) for 3 days at 37 \u00b0C and 5% "
