{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the spiro derivatives of the present invention inhibit CRTH2 at a concentration of <10\u03bcM. \nIn another embodiment, the spiro derivatives of the present invention inhibit CRTH2 at a concentration of <1\u03bcM. \nIn a preferred embodiment, the spiro-indolinone of the present invention inhibit CRTH2 at a concentration of <0.1\u03bcM.\nNon-specific binding was determined in the presence of 1 \u03bcM PGD2 (Cayman, USA).\nThe determination of the IC50 values (i.e. the amount necessary to achieve 50% inhibition of binding (in \u03bcM)) were performed in 96 well plates, in a final volume of 100\u03bcl according to the above described filtration assay. \nKi values were determined by equilibrium competition binding experiments against [3H]PGD2. \nThe Ki values give the ligand concentrations necessary to inhibit 50% of the binding Of[3H]PGD2 to CRTH2. \nSamples were incubated for 30 min in the presence of increasing concentrations OfPGD2 for the determination of agonist activity, or with 80nM of PGD2 for determination of antagonist activity, respectively."}
