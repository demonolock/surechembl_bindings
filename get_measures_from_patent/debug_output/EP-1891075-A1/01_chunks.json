After two rinses of phosphate buffered saline (PBS), cells were harvested in 10ml of PBS containing ImM EDTA, centriftiged at 500 x g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C and frozen at -80<sup>0</sup>C. The pellet was re-suspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2mM EDTA, 25OmM Sucrose, containing protease inhibitor cocktail tablets, (Complete EDTA-free, Roche, Germany) and incubated 30 min at 4\u00b0C. Cells were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation (Parr Instruments, USA) at 4\u00b0C (800 p.s.i. for 30 min), and centrifuged at 500 x g for lOmin at 4\u00b0C. Pellet containing nuclei and cellular debris was discarded and supernatant was centriftiged 60 min at 4\u00b0C at 45000 x g. Membrane pellet was re-suspended in storage buffer (1OmM HEPES/KOH pH 7.4, ImM EDTA, 25OmM sucrose, protease inhibitor cocktail tablets) using Dounce homogenization and frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80<sup>0</sup>C.</p>\n  Example 122: Radioligand binding assay</p>\n  The compounds of the present invention inhibit the binding of PGD2 to its receptor</p>\n  CRTH2. The inhibitory activity can be investigated by a radioligand binding assay (Sawyer et al., Br. J. Pharmocol 2002, 137, 1163-72). The radioligand binding assay was performed at room temperature in binding buffer (1OmM HEPES/KOH pH 7.4, 1OmM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, with protease inhibitor cocktail tablets), containing 1.5nM [<sup>3</sup>H]PGD<sub>2</sub> (Amersham, 156 Cie/mmol), and lO\u03bcg of hCRTH2 HEK293 (EBNA) cell membrane protein in a final volume of lOO\u03bcl in 96 well plates (Corning, USA). Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 1 \u03bcM PGD<sub>2</sub> (Cayman, USA). Competing spiro-indolinones were diluted in dimethylsulphoxide so that the totale volume of dimethylsulfoxide was kept constant at 1% dimethylsulphoxide (Me<sub>2</sub>SO) Serial dilutions of lOO\u03bcM and 100 pm were prepared. 10 \u03bcl each of these spiro-indolinone stock solutions were added. Incubation (60min at room \n\ntemperature) was terminated by rapid filtration through 96 wells hydrophobic GF/C Unifilter plates (Whatman, USA). Filters were washed twice with 250\u03bcl of Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1OmM MnC12, and residual radioligand bound to the filters was mixed to lOO\u03bcl of liquid scintillation cocktail (Optiphase Supermix, Perkin Elmer, USA) and binding activity was determined by counting residual radioligand using a 1450 Micro-beta scintillation counter (Wallac, UK). The following representative compounds were tested. All inhibited the binding of PGD2 to CRTH2 by more than 70%.</p>\n  (r-benzyl-5-chloro-2,2',5'-trioxospiro[indole-3,3'-pyrrolidin]-l(2H)-yl)acetic acid (1 '-benzyl-5-fluoro-2,2',5'-trioxospiro[indole-3,3'-pyrrolidin]-l (2H)-yl)acetic acid 4-(l '-allyl-5-chloro-2,2',5'-trioxospiro[indole-3,3'-pyrrolidin]-l (2H)-yl)butanoic acid [5-chloro-r-(2-methoxyethyl)-2,2',5'-trioxospiro[indole-3,3'-pyrrolidin]-l(2H)-yl]acetic acid</p>\n  4-(r-benzyl-5-chloro-2,2',5'-trioxospiro[indole-3,3'-pyrrolidin]-l(2H)-yl)butanoic acid (r-benzyl-5-methoxy-2,2',5'-trioxospiro[indole-3,3'-pyrrolidin]-l(2H)-yl)acetic acid [5-fluoro- 1 '-[(2-methoxyethoxy)methyl]-2,2',5'-trioxospiro[indole-3 ,3 -pyrrolidin]- 1 (2H)- yl]acetic acid</p>\n  4-(l '-allyl-5-fluoro-2,2',5'-trioxospiro[indole-3,3'-pyrrolidin]-l (2H)-yl)butanoic acid 4-(r-benzyl-5-fluoro-2,2',5'-trioxospiro[indole-3,3'-pyrrolidin]-l(2H)-yl)butanoic acid</p>\n  Example 123: Determination of Kj (Radioligand binding assay)</p>\n  Ki values were determined by equilibrium competition binding experiments against [<sup>3</sup>H]PGD<sub>2</sub>. Ki values were calculated from the formula below and represent the average of at least three independent dose response experiments. The Ki values give the ligand concentrations necessary to inhibit 50% of the binding Of[<sup>3</sup>H]PGD<sub>2</sub> to CRTH2. Ki= IC<sub>50</sub>/(l+[Concentration of Ligand]/Kd)] \n\nAll experiments were performed in 96 well plates, in a final volume of lOO\u03bcl according to the above described filtration assay. The concentration of membranes and 3[H]PGD<sub>2</sub>, as well as the positive and negative controls were identical to the conditions described above.</p>\n  In one embodiment, the spiro derivatives of the present invention inhibit CRTH2 at a concentration of &lt;10\u03bcM. In another embodiment, the spiro derivatives of the present invention inhibit CRTH2 at a concentration of &lt;l\u03bcM. In a preferred embodiment, the spiro- indolinone of the present invention inhibit CRTH2 at a concentration of &lt;0.1\u03bcM.</p>\n  Ki values of representative compounds are shown in Table 1. It can be derived that said compounds according to Formula (I) showed a significant inhibition of the binding of PGD2 to CRTH2. \n\n</p>\n  Table 1</p>\n  \n    \n\n    \n\n    \n  </p>\n  Example 124: [<sup>35</sup>SlGTPyS binding assay</p>\n  The [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPyS assay measures the increase in guanine nucleotide exchange at G-proteins in cell membranes, resulting from agonist (PGD2) binding to CRTH2. This process can be monitored in vitro by incubating cell membranes containing G-proteins and CRTH2 with GDP and [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPyS, a radiolabeled, hydrolysis-resistant analogue of GTP (see, Harrison et al., Life Sciences 74, 489-508, 2003). The addition of a spiro-indolinone results in binding to CRTH2 and thus in an inhibition of agonist binding, which can be monitered as inhibition of the stimulation of GTP/GDP exchange.</p>\n  Assay conditions were identical to conditions of radioligand binding assay as described in Example 21. The [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPyS binding assay was performed at 30<sup>0</sup>C with gentle agitation in</p>\n  96-well scintillating white polystyrene plates (Perkin Elmer, USA), in a final volume of</p>\n  200 \u03bcl, containing 2% of dimethylsulphoxide (Me<sub>2</sub>SO). The spiro derivatives were incubated in 2OmM HEPES/KOH pH 7.4, 1OmM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, lO\u03bcg/ml Saponin, 3\u03bcM GDP,</p>\n  15OmM NaCl containing lO\u03bcg of membranes expressing the hCRTH2 receptor (Euroscreen, Belgium) for 10 min. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of lO\u03bcM of GTPyS. Samples were incubated for 30 min in the presence of increasing concentrations OfPGD<sub>2</sub> for the determination of agonist activity, or with 8OnM of PGD<sub>2</sub> for determination of antagonist activity, respectively. 0.15nM of [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPyS were subsequently added to each sample and after incubation of 30min reactions were stopped by centrifugation at 1000 x g, at 4\u00b0C for 10 min. Supernatant was removed and [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPyS binding was determined using a 1450 Micro-beta scintillation counter. Data were analysed \n\nusing \"Prism\" (GraphPad Software, Inc. San Diego, USA). The determination of the IC50 values (i.e. the amount necessary to achieve 50% inhibition of binding (in \u03bcM)) were performed in 96 well plates, in a final volume of lOO\u03bcl according to the above described filtration assay. The concentration of membranes and radioactive ligand, as well as the positive and negative controls were identical to the conditions used and described aboveExamples 122 and 123.</p>\n  IC<sub>5</sub>O values of representative compounds are shown in Table 2. It can be derived that said compounds according to Formula (I) showed a significant inhibition of the binding of PGD2 to CRTH2.

The model is well established for characterization of compound for dermatological indications like psoriasis and allergic contact dermatitis (Xu et al. J Exp Med. 183, 1001-12, 1996). It involves a sensitization phase and a subsequent challenge with an antigen (DNFB, 2,4-dinitrofluorbenzene). This results in skin inflammation with formation of edema and cellular infiltrates in the skin. The edema can be measured by caliper at the challenged site (ear of the mice). Intravenous or oral administration with 10% Labrasol as vehicle of the compounds of the invention 30 min before challenge with DNFB results in a decrease of the swelling and therefore reduces inflammation in the skin compared to positiv"
