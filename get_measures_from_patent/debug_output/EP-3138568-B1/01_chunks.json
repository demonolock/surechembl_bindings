    "up of abundant cysteine, glutathione and albumin in vivo. Currently, there is no effective way to actively promote ring opening reaction of sulfosuccinimide, and thus the break-off of cytotoxin in vivo is out of control, leaving a potential risk for drug safety.</p>The current mainstream conjugation technology is chemical coupling strategy mainly based on the lysine or cysteine residues in the antibody. Due to the diversity in number and location of these amino acids in antibody which can react with linkers, the number and location of the cytotoxins in the ADCs are variable, and ADCs thus obtained are heterogenous. This heterogeneity will affect the quality, stability, effectiveness, metabolism and toxicity of ADCs. For example, in the drug instruction of Kadcyla, an ADC which was marketed in 2013, it clearly indicated that the number of cytotoxins in each antibody is between 0 and 8, the average n is about 3.5. To solve the problem of heterogeneity of ADCs has become the main task and a big challenge in the development of a new generation of ADCs.</p>ErbB2/Her2 antigen, which is a member of the mammal (including human) epidermal growth factor receptor transmembrane receptor family, is over-expressed in about 20% of breast cancer and 16% of gastric cancer cell surface (Slamon et et 1987, Science, Vol235: 177-182). Humanized monoclonal antibody of Trastuzumab (tradename Herceptin) can selectively bind to the extracellular region of human ErbB2/Her2 antigen with high affinity (Kd = 5nM), inhibiting tumor cell proliferation and growth (Hudziak et al. 1989, Mol. Cell Biol, Vol 9: 1165-1172; Lewis et al. 1993, Cancer Immuno Immunother, Vol 37: 255-263; Baselga et al. 1998, Cancer Res, Vol 58:2825-2831). Herceptin showed more significant effects than chemotherapy alone when being used to treat ErbB2/Her2 positive patients and achieved a great commercial success. However, with the widely use of Herceptin, problem has gradually come out that some patients have less or non-response to the treatment.</p>Summary of the InventionThis invention relates to a novel coupling functional linker (also referred to as coupling agent), a linker-payload intermediate, the ring-opening reaction thereof and the preparation method thereof. The present invention also relates to a conjugate formed by coupling of the C-terminus of proteins and peptides to linker-payload intermediate in a site-specific manner, and the preparation method thereof. The present invention further relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the conjugate. The present invention also relates to the use of the conjugate or the pharmaceutical composition comprising the conjugate in the treatment or prevention of a disease.</p>In one aspect, the present invention provides a compound of Formula (I), (II), (III) or (IV):\n<img id=\"ib0001\" path=\"imgb0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/494691269/EP/20190417/B1/000003/13/85/68/imgb0001.tif\"/>\n<img id=\"ib0002\" path=\"imgb0002.tif\""
