    " the fruit extract according to the concentration saw. As a result, it was confirmed that the activity (%) of 5 alpha-reductase was inhibited rapidly from 100 to 92.79, 61.11 and 31.58 (%) in group 5 as the concentration of the fruit extract increased.</p>As described above, the fruit extract in the present invention is an inhibitor of 5-alpha-reductase, which converts testosterone (T) into dihydro testosterone (DHT) and has an effect of inhibiting 5-alpha-reductase, an important enzyme involved in prostate-related diseases. Appeared. In addition, it was confirmed that as the concentration of the fruit extract increased, the activity (%) of 5 alpha-reductase decreased rapidly, significantly inhibiting the action of 5-alpha-reductase. In particular, the fruit extract in the present invention was confirmed to have an excellent activity inhibitory effect of 5 alpha-reductase at a concentration of 0.1\u03bcg / ml or more and 90\u03bcg / ml or less.</p>1-3. Determination of Enzyme Inhibition Rate for 5-alpha Reductase (Control: Finasteride)</p>A positive control (finasteride) was used as a sample to compare the inhibitory effect of 5 alpha reductase. Finasteride is an inhibitor of type 2 alpha-reductase, which is now widely used in the art.</p>Based on the enzyme inhibition rate and the concentration of 50% inhibiting the activity of 5 alpha-reductase based on the enzyme measured in the groups 3 to 5 of Experimental Example 1-2 was calculated.</p>In addition, the enzyme inhibition rate and IC 50 of finasteride (F1293, Sigma-aldrich, USA) at 0.25 \u03bcM, 0.5 \u03bcM, and 1 \u03bcM concentrations were calculated by the same method.</p>The results are shown in Table 3 below. * P &lt;0.05, ** P &lt;0.01 is significant when compared with group 1, while # P &lt;0.05 and ## P &lt;0.01 are significant when comparing with group 2.</p>TABLE 3 sampledensityEnzyme Inhibition Rate (%)IC50 Basement room (\u03bcg / ml)  607080  7.21 \u00b1 4.5 138.89 \u00b1 7.6468.42 \u00b1 5.97  73.92 \u00b1 0.63  Finasteride (\u03bcM)  0.250.51  10.53 \u00b1 2.6060.90 \u00b1 15.3578.20 \u00b1 12.42  0.60 \u00b1 0.12 </p>As can be seen from the results of Table 3, it was confirmed that the higher the concentration of the fruit extract, the activity inhibition rate (5%) of the 5 alpha-reductase was rapidly increased to significantly inhibit the action of the 5 alpha-reductase.</p>In addition, the IC50 of the fruit extract in the present invention was 73.92 \u00b1 0.63 (\u03bcg / ml), the IC50 of finasteride, an inhibitor of 5-alpha-reductase widely used in the art is 0.60 \u00b1 0.12 (\u03bcM). This can be seen that the 5 alpha-reductase activity inhibitory effect is excellent considering that the fruit extract is a natural extract.</p>These results support the fact that the fruit extract in the present invention inhibits the 5 alpha-reductase to prevent, treat, and improve the prostate-related diseases in which 5 alpha-reductase is important.</p>Experimental Example 2: Confirmation of the effect of prostatic hypertrophy in the animal model (extract)</p>2-1. Animal Model Production</p>Ten weeks-old male wistar rats (purchased central experiment animals, 6 per group) were purified for 1 week, and then TP (testosterone propionate) was injected subcutaneously at 3 mg / kg for 4 weeks to prepare a prostatic hypertrophy inducing group.</p>One hour before the injection of TP, the fruit extract of Example 2 was orally administered at 200 mg / kg for 4 weeks to prepare an experimental group. A positive control group was prepared by orally administering 10 mg / kg of finasteride, a 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitor used as a prostatic hypertrophy agent. In the solvent control, corn oil was injected subcutaneously.</p>2-2. Prostate weight measurement</p>After extracting the prostate gland from the animal model produced in Experimental Example 2-1, the weight thereof was measured and shown in FIG. 2 (NC: normal group, BPH: prostatic hypertrophy group, Fin: prostatic hypertrophy group + fina"
