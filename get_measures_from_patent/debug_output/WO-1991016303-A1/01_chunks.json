LTB<sub>4</sub> and LTC<sub>4</sub> were separated first by HPLC with a Spherisorb ODS colon (5 \u03bcm, 150 x 4.6 mm) and Spectroflow 400 Kratos Analytical pump. The \n\nflow rate was 1 ml/min and the solvents were methanol/water/acetic acid (68/32/0.1), pH 5.0 for LTB<sub>4</sub> and methanol/water/acetic acid/phosphoric acid (65/35/0.07/0.03), pH 5.5 for LTC . The peaks were analyzed f rther with Spektroflow 773 Kratos Analytical UV absorbance detector and leukotrienes were detected at the wavelength of 271 n and 280 nm for LTB<sub>4</sub> and LTC<sub>4</sub> , respectively.</p>The results are given in Table 2</p>Table 2</p>The LTB<sub>4</sub> and LTC<sub>4</sub> synthesis inhibition</p>The compound of -t-Cs o LTB<sub>4</sub> IC50 LTC<sub>4</sub> the Example \u03bcM \u03bcM</p>1 3.7 3.2 \n</p>"
