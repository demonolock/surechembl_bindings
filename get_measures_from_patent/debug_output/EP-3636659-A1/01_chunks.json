Polymyxin B gives a 3.4 value of GS. The compounds of the present invention give much lower values of GS, some 0 or almost 0. This means that the compounds of the invention are almost non-nephrotoxic, and some are as active as polymyxin or colistin, such as the compound of Examples 5 and 6.</p>In table 8, the comparative examples contain cysteine in position 10 of the sequence (not the new moiety (2R,3S)-3-amino-4-mercaptobutan-2-ol, Thiothreonine or Ttr, as the compounds of the present invention).. The comparative examples are much more nephrotoxic in the in vivo mice tests (nephrotoxicity GS &gt;4) than the compounds of the invention, even more than polymyxin B.</p>REFERENCES CITED IN THE APPLICATIONNon Patent LiteratureT.
