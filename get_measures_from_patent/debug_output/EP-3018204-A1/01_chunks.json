    "gy 157:421-430) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Callan RJ, Hartmann FA, West SE and Hinshaw VS. (1997) J Virol 71:7579-7585). Activation of influenza viruses by host serine proteases is generally considered to occur extracellularly either at the plasma membrane or after virus release from the cell.</p>Aprotinin, also called Trasylol, or bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) is a polypeptide having 58 amino acids. It belongs to the family of Kunitz-type inhibitors and competitively inhibits a wide spectrum of serine proteases, including trypsin, chymotrypsin, plasmin and plasma kallikrein. Aprotinin has long been used as a human therapeutics, such as treatment of pancreatitis, various states of shock syndrome, hyperfibrinolytic haemorrhage and myocardial infarction. It is also used in open-heart surgery, including cardiopulmonary bypass operations, to reduce blood loss (Fritz H and Wunderer G. (1983) Arzneim-Forsch 33:479-494).</p>The safety of aprotinin in human has been well documented through years of clinical applications. In addition, aprotinin is apparently a very weak immunogen as aprotinin-specific antibodies have not been observed in human sera so far (Fritz H and Wunderer G. (1983) Arzneim-Forsch 33:479-494). Another desired feature of aprotinin as a drug candidate is its superb stability. It can be kept at room temperature for at least 18 months without any loss of activity (Fritz H and Wunderer G. (1983) Arzneim-Forsch 33:479-494).</p>To achieve significant viral inhibition in animal studies that have been performed, aprotinin was administered at high doses. For example, 280 micrograms to 840 micrograms per day of aprotinin was injected intraperitoneally into each mouse for 6 days (Zhirnov OP, Ovcharenko AV and Bukrinskaya AG. (1984) J Gen Virol 65:191-196); a lower dosage was required for aerosol inhalation, still, each mouse was given 63 - 126 micrograms per day for 6 days (Ovcharenko AV and Zhirnov OP. (1994) Antiviral Res 23:107-118). A very high dose of aprotinin would be required in human based on extrapolation from the mouse data. Therefore to achieve better efficacy in human, the potency of aprotinin molecule needs to be significantly improved.</p>Aprotinin functions by competitively inhibiting serine proteases that are mostly on the surface of host respiratory epithelial cells. Local concentration of aprotinin in the vicinity of host proteases is therefore the key factor determining competitive advantage of aprotinin. We use two approaches that work synergistically to boost competitive advantage of aprotinin on the surface of respiratory epithelium.</p>First, the avidity (functional affinity) of aprotinin is increased by making multivalent aprotinin fusion proteins consisting of two, three, or more aprotinin proteins connected via linkers. Such a molecule is able to bind to membrane proteases in a multivalent fashion, which has significant kinetic advantage over the aprotinin monomer. Monomeric aprotinin binds to bovine trypsin very tightly with dissociation constant (Ki) being 6.0 x 10<sup>-14</sup> mol/l. However, its affinity compared to other proteases, such as chymotrypsin, plasmin and Kallikrein, which have been implicated in activation of influenza viruses, is much lower with Ki being at the level of 10<sup>-8</sup> to 10<sup>-9</sup> mol/l (Fritz H and Wunderer G. (1983) Arzneim-Forsch 33:479-494). Multimerization can increase aprotinin's affinity to these proteases exponentially.</p>Second, we fuse aprotinin with a respiratory epithelium-anchoring domain. The anchoring domain localizes aprotinin to the proximity of host membrane-associated proteases and maintains a high local concentration of aprotinin on epithelial surface. The anchoring domain also increases retention time of the drug on the respiratory epithelium.</p>CloningAprotinin is a single chain polypeptide having 58 amino acid residues and 3 intra-chain disulfide bonds (SEQ ID NO:1). The amino acid sequence of aprotinin is shown in Figure 1. Genes encoding aprotinin and aprotinin fusion proteins are synthesized by PCR using overlapping oligonucleotides with codons optimized for E. Coli expression as templates. The PCR products are cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). After sequencing, the genes are subcloned into an expression vector pQE (Qiagen). The vector carries a purification tag, Hisx6, to allow easy purification of the recombinant proteins. The constructs are used to transform E. Coli. The transformed cells grown in LB-ampicillin medium to mid-log phase are induced by IPTG according to standard protocols. Cells are pelleted and lysed in phosphate-buffered-saline (PBS) by sonication. The enzymes, which have His<sub>6</sub> purification tag, are purified using a nickel col",
    "Coli cell strains, such as BL21, JM83, etc, the multivalent aprotinin proteins are also expressed in Origami\u2122 cells (Novagen, Bad Soden, Germany). The Origami\u2122 cell strain does not have thioredoxin and glutathione reductase and thus has an oxidizing cytoplasm. This cell strain has been used to successfully express a number of proteins that contain disulfide bonds (Bessette PH, Aslund F, Beckwith J and Georgiou G. (1999) Pro Natl Acad Sci USA 96:13703-13708; Venturi M, Seifert C and Hunte C. (2001) J Mol Biol 315:1-8.).2. The epithelium cell-anchoring aprotinin. An epithelium cell-anchoring sequence is fused with aprotinin. The epithelium-anchoring sequence can be any peptide or polypeptide sequence that has affinity towards the surface of epithelial cells. We have selected three human GAG-binding sequences: PF4 (aa 47-70; SEQ ID NO: 2), IL-8 (aa 46-72; SEQ ID NO: 3), and AT III (aa 118-151; SEQ ID NO: 4) (Figure 2). These sequences bind to heparin/heparan sulfate with nanomolar-level affinities (Table 1). Heparin/Heparan Sulfate are ubiquitously present on the respiratory epithelium. In separate constructs, the GAG-binding sequences are fused with the aprotinin gene on the N terminus and on the C terminus via a generic linker sequence GGGGS as the following constructs:\n(GAG domain-GGGGS(SEQ ID NO:10)-Aprotinin); and(Aprotinin-GGGGS(SEQ ID NO:10)-GAG domain)\nTable 1. Affinities to HeparinProteinKd nM (ref)PF427 (44)IL-8&lt;5 (43)ATIII11 (42)ApoE620 (45)</p>Photometric trypsin inhibition assayThe trypsin inhibition activity of aprotinin and aprotinin fusion proteins is measured by a photometric assay described previously in detail (Fritz H and Wunderer G. (1983) Arzneim-Forsch 33:479-494). Briefly, in this assay aprotinin inhibits the trypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of Na-benzoyl-L-arginine-p-nitroanilide (BzArgpNA or L-BAPA) (Sigma), which is followed photometrically at 405 nm. One trypsin unit (U<sub>BAPA</sub>) corresponds to the hydrolysis of 1 micromole substrate per min. One inhibitor unit (IU<sub>BAPA</sub>) decreases the activity of two trypsin units by 50%, which corresponds arithmetically to the inhibition of 1 U<sub>BAPA</sub> of trypsin. The specific activity of aprotinin is given in IU<sub>BAPA</sub>/mg polypeptide.</p>Surface plasmon resonance assayThe affinities of dimeric and trimeric aprotinin with various linkers are compared against the monomeric aprotinin using surface plasmon resonance assay, or BIAcore analysis (BIAcore, Piscataway, NJ) with human plasmin as the target. Similarly, BIAcore assay with heparin as the target is used to analyze affinity between GAG binding aprotinin fusion proteins and heparin.</p>When plasmin is used as the target, purified human plasmin (Sigma) is immobilized on the CM5 chip according manufacturer's instructions (BIAcore, Piscataway, NJ). When heparin is the target, biotinylated albumin and albumin-heparin (Sigma) are captured on a streptavidin-coated BIAcore SA chip as described previously (Xiang Y and Moss B. (2003) J Virol 77:2623-2630).</p>Example 2: Establishing improved tissue culture models for studies on influenza virus infection.Stocks of Influenza VirusesInfluenza viral strains are obtained from ATCC and the repository at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. All experiments involving influenza viruses are conducted at Bio-safety level II.</p>Viruses are propagated by injection into the allantoic cavity of nine-day-old chicken embryos as described (Zhirnov OP, Ovcharenko AV and Bukrinskaya AG. (1985) J Gen Virol 66:1633-1638). Alternatively, viral stocks are grown on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells in minim",
    "tion is altered from immediately after aprotinin treatment to 2-24 hours post treatment. Viral titer, infectivity and cytopathic effect are measured for 3 to 5 day after infection as described above. Results from these experiments distinguish various aprotinin fusion proteins by the lengths of the effective window after a single prophylactic treatment.2.Post-infection Treatment. For multi-dose treatment, cells are first infected by viral inoculations at 0.001 to 0.1 MOI for 1 hour. Various concentrations of aprotinin fusion proteins are added immediately afterwards, additional treatments are applied at 8-hour intervals during the first 48 hours post infection. Cells are cultured until day 7 post infection. Viral titer and infectivity in the media are followed during the whole process. Cytopathic effect is evaluated at the end of the experiment.</p>For single dose treatment, cells are first infected by viral inoculations at 0.001 to 0.1 MOI for 1 hour. Treatments of aprotinin fusion proteins at various concentrations are applied at different time points during the first 48 hours after infection, but each cell sample only receives one treatment during the whole experiment. Cells are cultured until day 7 post infection. Viral titer and infectivity in the media are followed during the whole process. Cytopathic effect is evaluated at the end of the experiment. Results from these experiments distinguish different types of aprotinin fusion proteins for their therapeutic potency.</p>Inhibition of HA Cleavage by Aprotinin Fusion ProteinsTo demonstrate that aprotinin fusion proteins inhibit influenza viral infection by inhibiting cleavage of influenza HA protein, a human primary epithelial cell culture is infected with influenza virus at MOI of 1. Aprotinin fusion proteins are added to the culture either right before viral inoculation or immediately after the viral infection. At 6.5 hour post infection, the culture is incubated for 1 hour in MEM lacking cold methionine and containing <sup>35</sup>S-labeled methionine (Amersham) at a concentration of 100 microCi/ml (pulse). Thereafter, the cells are washed twice with MEM containing a 10-fold concentration of cold methionine and incubated in MEM for additional 3 hours (chase). After labeling, cells are dissolved in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer, HA is precipitated by anti-serum against the particular strain of virus used for infection (anti-influenza sera can be obtained from ATCC and Center of Disease Control and Prevention), and immunocomplex is then purified by protein G-Sepharose (Amersham). Samples are fractionated by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. In samples untreated by aprotinin fusion proteins, HA1 and HA2 are expected to be the predominant HA species; while in aprotinin treated samples, HA0 is expected to be the major type of HA present.</p>Example 4: Synthesizing genes of five sialidases, expressing and purifying the sialidase proteins.IntroductionInfluenza viruses belong to ",
