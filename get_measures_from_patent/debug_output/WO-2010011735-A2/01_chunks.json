    " been depleted by chemotherapy, or as a prelude to bone marrow transplants. For example, for cancer patients, G-</p>CSF is beneficial as a means of selectively stimulating neutrophil production to compensate for \n\n hematopoietic deficits resulting from chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Other indications include treatment of various infectious diseases and related conditions, such as sepsis, which is typically caused by a metabolite of bacteria. G-CSF is also useful alone, or in combination with other compounds, such as other cytokines, for growth or expansion of cells in culture, for example, for bone marrow transplants,</p>[29] The G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR) is a member of the hernatopoietic/cytokine/giOwth factor receptor family, which includes several other growth factor receptors, such as the interleukin (IL)-3, -4 and -6 receptors, the granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor, the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor, as well as the prolactin and growth hormone receptors. See, Bazan, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 87: 6934-6938 (1990). Members of the cytokine receptor family contain four conserved cysteine residues and a tryptophan-serine-X-tryptophan-serine motif positioned just outside the transmembrane region. The conserved sequences are thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions. See, e.g., Chiba et al., Biochim. Biophys. Res. Comm. 184: 485-490 (1992). The G-CSF receptor consists of a single peptide chain with a molecular weight of about 150 kD (Nicola, Immunol. Today 8 (1987), 134).</p>[30] Glycosylated hG-CSF has been compared with de-glycosylated hG-CSF, prepared by in vitro enzymatic digestion with neuraminidase and endo-\u03b1-N- acetylgalactosaminidase, with respect to its stability as a function of pH and temperature (Oh- eda et al., 1990, J. Biol. Chem. 265 (20): 11432-35). The de-glycosylated hG-CSF, dissolved at a concentration of 1 \u03bcg/mL in 20 mM phosphate buffer containing 0.2 M NaCl and 0.01% Tween 20 was rapidly inactivated within the pH range of from about pH 7 to about pH 8 after a two-day incubation at 37\u00b0C. In contrast, glycosylated hG-CSF retained over 80% of its activity under the same conditions. Furthermore, evaluation of the thermal stability of both forms of hG- CSF, measured by biological assay and caloi\u03cametric analysis, indicated that de-glycosylated hG- CSF was less thermally stable than the native form of hG-CSF.</p>[31] A number of approaches have been taken in order to provide stable, pharmaceutically acceptable G-CSF compositions. One approach to improving the composition stability of G-CSF involves the synthesis of derivatives of the protein. U.S. Pat, No. 5,665,863 discloses the formation of recombinant chimeric proteins comprising G-CSF coupled with albumin, which have new pharmacokinetic properties. U.S. Pat.

The assay plate was centrifuged at 800xg for 2 minutes, and the supernatant was discarded. The erythrocytes were lysed for 1 minute by adding 150ul of cold lysis solution (0.15M phosphate, pH7.2), and the isotonicity was restored by adding 50ul of restoring solution (0.15M phosphate, 0.5M NaCl, pH7.4). The plate was centrifuged again, and the supernatant was discarded. The lysis procedure was repeated until all red blood cells that were visible were removed. The cells were washed with 200ul FACS buffer twice (IxPBS, 2.5mM HEPES, 0.1% sodium azide, 2.0% FBS) and resuspended in lOOul FACS buffer. 20ug/ml of secondary antibody (Goat anti-mouse IgGl, Human ads-PE) was added and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 30 minutes in the dark. The cells were pelleted and washed twice and resuspended in 200ul FACS buffer. The BD FACS Array instrument was used to acquire 50,000 events and count CDl Ib positive cells.</p>[676] Figure 15 shows the results of the experiment in which bovine neutrophils were stained with CDlIb antibody to assess their responsiveness to various molecules. The Mean Fluorescent Intensity (MFI) for granulocytes was used to determine the level of CDlIb presentation on the cell surface. The %MFI is a normalized value relative to an unstimualted control group. Dose response curves and EC50 values were generated for Neupogen, Neulasta, and bG-CSF T133pAF-20K PEG based on a 4-parameter fit. The EC50 value for Neupogen<sup>\u00ae</sup> was 3.18 ng/ml.

The blood samples are analyzed for the following hematological parameters: hemoglobin, red blood cell count, hematocrit, mean cell volume, mean cell hemoglobin concentration, mean cell hemoglobin, white blood cell count, differential leukocyte count (neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes), On the basis of these measurements the biological efficacy of conjugated and non-conjugated bG-CSF and variants thereof is evaluated.</p>Example 26</p>An in vivo study assessing the impact of bG-CSF-T133pAF 2OK PEG variant on the hematological responses of cattle</p>[731] Recombinant bG-CSF containing a single pAF substitution at position T133 (bG-</p>CSF T133pAF-20K PEG) was produced in E. coli.
