    "eptor.</p>Spiro [ benzopyran ] or spiro [ benzofuran ] derivatives are also disclosed in EP 1847542, as well as pyrazole derivatives having pharmacological activity towards sigma receptors (EP 1634873).</p>WO 2009/071657 discloses certain tricyclic triazole compounds, although structurally different from the compounds of the present invention having activity against sigma receptors.</p>However, there is still a need to find compounds with pharmacological activity towards the sigma receptor that are potent, selective, and/or have good \"drugability\" properties, i.e. good pharmaceutical properties related to administration, distribution, metabolism and excretion.</p>Surprisingly, it has been observed that novel oxa-diazaspiro compounds of general formula (I) show an activity towards sigma<sub>1</sub>The selective affinity of the receptor ranges from good to excellent. These compounds are therefore particularly suitable as pharmacologically active agents in medicaments for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of disorders or diseases related to the sigma receptor.</p>Disclosure of Invention</p>The present invention discloses novel compounds with great affinity for sigma receptors and high solubility in physiological media, which are useful for the treatment of sigma related disorders or diseases.</p>Since the invention is intended to provide as \u03c3<sub>1</sub>A compound of a receptor ligand or a chemically related series of compounds, therefore if the compound has binding expressed as Ki (it is preferred that&lt;1000nM, more preferably&lt;500nM, even more preferred is&lt;100nM), it is a very preferred embodiment.</p>The invention relates in a main aspect to compounds of the general formula (I),</p></p>wherein R is<sub>1</sub>\u3001R<sub>2</sub>\u3001R<sub>3</sub>\u3001R<sub>3\u2019</sub>\u3001R<sub>5</sub>\u3001R<sub>5\u2019</sub>\u3001R<sub>6</sub>\u3001R<sub>6\u2019</sub>X, Y, m, n, q and r are as defined below in the detailed description.</p>A further object of the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of compounds of the general formula (I).</p>Still a further object of the present invention relates to the use of intermediate compounds for the preparation of compounds of general formula (I).</p>Pharmaceutical compositions comprising compounds of formula (I) are also an object of the present invention.</p>Finally, an object of the present invention is the use of the compounds as medicaments and especially for the treatment of pain and pain-related disorders.</p>Detailed Description</p>The present invention discloses novel compounds with great affinity for sigma receptors and high solubility in physiological media, which are useful for the treatment of sigma related disorders or diseases.</p>Since the invention is intended to provide as \u03c3<sub>1</sub>A compound of a receptor ligand or a chemically related series of compounds, therefore if the compound has binding expressed as Ki (it is preferred that&lt;1000nM, more preferably&lt;500nM, even more preferred is&lt;100nM), it is a very preferred embodiment.</p>Advantageously, the compounds according to the invention will additionally exhibit one or more of the following functions: sigma<sub>1</sub>Receptor antagonism. It must be noted, however, that functional \"antagonism\" and \"agonism\" are also subdivided in their action into sub-functions, such as partial agonism or inverse agonism. Thus, the function of a compound should be considered to be within a relatively broad bandwidth.</p>Antagonists block or inhibit agonist-mediated responses. Known subfunctions are neutral antagonists (neutralantagonists) or inverse agonists.</p>Agonists increase the activity of the receptor beyond its basal level. Known subfunctions are full agonists or partial agonists.</p>The invention relates in a main aspect to compounds of the general formula (I),</p>in a particular aspect, the invention relates to compounds of general formula (I):</p></p>wherein</p>R<sub>1</sub>Is composed of</p>m is 1,2,3, 4 or 5;</p>n is 0, 1,2,3, 4 or 5;</p>p is 0 or 1;</p>q is 0, 1 or 2;</p>r is 0, 1 or 2;</p>x is a bond, -C (R)<sub>x</sub>R<sub>x\u2019</sub>)-\u3001-C(O)-\u3001-O-\u3001-C(O)NR<sub>7</sub>-\u3001-NR<sub>7</sub>C (O) -or-C (O) O-;</p>wherein R is<sub>x</sub>Selected from halogen, or substituted or unsubstituted C<sub>1-6</sub>Alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted C<sub>2-6</sub>Alkenyl, substituted or unsubstituted C<sub>2-6</sub>Alkynyl, and-OR<sub>7</s"
