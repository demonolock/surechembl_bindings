    "n, \u201celimination half-time\u201d is used in its ordinary sense, as is described in Goodman and Gillman's The Pharmaceutical Basis of Therapeutics 21-25 (Alfred Goodman Gilman, Louis S. Goodman, and Alfred Gilman, eds., 6th ed. 1980). Briefly, the term is meant to encompass a quantitative measure of the time course of drug elimination. The elimination of most drugs is exponential (i.e., follows first-order kinetics), since drug concentrations usually do not approach those required for saturation of the elimination process. The rate of an exponential process may be expressed by its rate constant, k, which expresses the fractional change per unit of time, or by its half-time, t1/2 the time required for 50% completion of the process. The units of these two constants are time-1 and time, respectively. A first-order rate constant and the half-time of the reaction are simply related (k\u00d7t1/2=0.693) and may be interchanged accordingly. Since first-order elimination kinetics dictates that a constant fraction of drug is lost per unit time, a plot of the log of drug concentration versus time is linear at all times following the initial distribution phase (i.e., after drug absorption and distribution are complete). The half-time for drug elimination can be accurately determined from such a graph.</p><p id=\"p-0096\" num=\"0095\">As used herein, the term \u201cbinding affinity\u201d refers to the affinity of the proteins described in the disclosure to their binding targets and is expressed numerically using \u201cKd\u201d values. If two or more proteins are indicated to have comparable binding affinities towards their binding targets, then the Kd values for binding of the respective proteins towards their binding targets, are within \u00b12-fold of each other. If two or more proteins are indicated to have comparable binding affinities towards single binding target, then the Kd values for binding of the respective proteins towards said single binding target, are within +2-fold of each other. If a protein is indicated to bind two or more targets with comparable binding affinities, then the Kd values for binding of said protein to the two or more targets are within +2-fold of each other. In general, a higher Kd value corresponds to a weaker binding. In some embodiments, the \u201cKd\u201d is measured by a radiolabeled antigen binding assay (RIA) or surface plasmon resonance assays using a BIACORE\u2122-2000 or a BIACORE\u2122-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.). In certain embodiments, an \u201con-rate\u201d or \u201crate of association\u201d or \u201cassociation rate\u201d or \u201ckon\u201d and an \u201coff-rate\u201d or \u201crate of dissociation\u201d or \u201cdissociation rate\u201d or \u201ckoff\u201d are also determined with the surface plasmon resonance technique using a BIACORE\u2122-2000 or a BIACORE\u2122-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.). In additional embodiments, the \u201cKd\u201d, \u201ckon\u201d, and \u201ckoff\u201d are measured using the OCTET\u00ae Systems (Pall Life Sciences). In an exemplary method for measuring binding affinity using the OCTET\u00ae Systems, the ligand, e.g., biotinylated human or cynomolgus DLL3, is immobilized on the OCTET\u00ae streptavidin capillary sensor tip surface which streptavidin tips are then activated according to manufacturer's instructions using about 20-50 \u03bcg/ml human or cynomolgus DLL3 protein. A solution of PBS/Casein is also introduced as a blocking agent. For association kinetic measurements, DLL3 binding protein variants are introduced at a concentration ranging from about 10 ng/mL to about 100 \u03bcg/mL, about 50 ng/mL to about 5 \u03bcg/mL, or about 2 ng/mL to about 20 \u03bcg/mL. In some embodiments, the DLL3 binding single domain proteins are used at a concentration ranging from about 2 ng/mL to about 20 \u03bcg/mL. Complete dissociation is observed in case of the negative control, assay buffer without the binding proteins. The kinetic parameters of the binding reactions are then determined using an appropriate tool, e.g., ForteBio software.</p><p id=\"p-0097\" num=\"0096\">One embodiment provides a DLL3 binding protein (also referred to herein as an DLL3 binding domain, such as the DLL3 binding domain of a DLL3 trispecific antibody of this disclosure) that comprises a single domain antibody, comprising a CDR1 sequence comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS: 443-884 and 1887, a CDR2 sequence comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS: 885-1326 and 1888, and a CDR3 sequence comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS: 1327-1768 and 1889.
