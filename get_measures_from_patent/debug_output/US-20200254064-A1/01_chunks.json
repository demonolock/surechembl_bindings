    "e of recombinant interferon gamma human and lysostaphin.</p>Protein-based products should often have high concentration to achieve positive effect. The performed experiments have shown that the use of these substances in the recommended doses makes many problems, including manufacturing, stability maintaining, delivery, which is especially characteristic for proteins. And there are also problems associated with protein product opalescence and aggregation. In addition, self-association of two main proteins leads to an increase in the viscosity of the solution, which makes it difficult to obtain high protein concentrations during filtration. Therefore, the limits of the quantitative content of proteins as well as the quantitative and component composition necessary for their stabilization should be determined experimentally. Thus, the upper limit of interferon gamma is 2.000.000 IU/g, for lysostaphin it is 200 units/g. The lower one is also determined experimentally and comprises 500.000 IU/g and 50 U/g for interferon and lysostaphin, respectively.</p>It should be noted that use of recombinant interferon gamma human obtained from Escherichia coli strain containing recombinant plasmid DNA pGIF315 is a preferable combination of the claimed thermostable composition. This is due to the following reasons.</p>Recombinant plasmid pGIF315 contains promoters providing high constitutive expression gene encoding gamma-interferon of a size of 144 aminoacids with a molecular weight of 16.9 kD in E. coli cells (patent for invention RU 2214832, published on 27 Oct. 2003). This, other factors being equal, allows the use of ordinary nutrient media that do not require the deficiency of any components or the addition of any inducers, which simplifies the technology and reduces the production cost. The plasmid can be transformed into any strains of E. coli that meets the requirements for producer strains, for example, SG 200-50 or BL 21.</p>Surprisingly, it has been found that methoxypolyethylene glycol, sodium alginate and dextran in the claimed amount can reduce or prevent the effect of both external factors and negative interaction/reaction between biologically active proteins contained in the thermostable composition during the formation of a stable complex.</p>As shown by the studies performed, use of the thermostable composition in a lyophilized form is the most optimal due to easy manufacture as well as convenience in transportation and storage, because there is no need to follow temperature regime. The obtained dry preparation is a white lyophilized powder that is well dissolved in water and saline for injection to form a clear, colorless or slightly yellowish solution. The obtained product possesses a controlled antiviral and antibacterial activity.</p>Stable antimicrobial and antiviral effect is ensured by stabilization of recombinant interferon gamma human and lysostaphin in the composition that is provided by optimal formulation and ratios of components.
