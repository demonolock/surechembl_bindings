    "al motif of LXXC. PhtD is disclosed in WO 00/37105, and is also referred to SpO36D. As noted above, it also is a protein from the polyhistidine triad family and has the type Il LXXC signal motif. PhtB is disclosed in WO 00/37105, and is also referred to SpO36B. Another member of the PhtB family is the C3-Degrading Polypeptide, as disclosed in WO 00/17370. This protein also is from the polyhistidine triad family and has the type Il LXXC signal motif. For example, an immunologically functional equivalent is the protein Sp42 disclosed in WO 98/18930. A PhtB truncate (approximately 79kD) is disclosed in WO99/15675 which is also considered a member of the PhtX family. PhtE is disclosed in WO00/30299 and is referred to as BVH-3. Where any Pht protein is referred to herein, it is meant that immunogenic fragments or fusions thereof of the Pht protein can be used. For example, a reference to PhtX includes immunogenic fragments or fusions thereof from any Pht protein. A reference to PhtD or PhtB is also a reference to PhtDE or PhtBE fusions as found, for example, in WO0198334.</p>Pneumolysin is a multifunctional toxin with a distinct cytolytic (hemolytic) and complement activation activities (Rubins et al., Am . Respi. Cit Care Med, 153:1339-1346 (1996)). The toxin is not secreted by pneumococci, but it is released upon lysis of pneumococci under \n\n the influence of autolysin. Its effects include e.g., the stimulation of the production of inflammatory cytokines by human monocytes, the inhibition of the beating of cilia on human respiratory epithelial, and the decrease of bactericidal activity and migration of neutrophils. The most obvious effect of pneumolysin is in the lysis of red blood cells, which involves binding to cholesterol. Because it is a toxin, it needs to be detoxified (i.e., non-toxic to a human when provided at a dosage suitable for protection) before it can be administered in vivo. Expression and cloning of wild-type or native pneumolysin is known in the art. See, for example, Walker et al. (Infect Immun, 55:1 184-1189 (1987)), Mitchell et al. (Biochim Biophys Acta, 1007:67-72 (1989) and Mitchell et al (NAR, 18:4010 (1990)). Detoxification of ply can be conducted by chemical means, e.g., subject to formalin or glutaraldehyde treatment or a combination of both (WO 04081515, PCT/EP2005/010258). Such methods are well known in the art for various toxins. Alternatively, ply can be genetically detoxified. Thus, the invention encompasses derivatives of pneumococcal proteins which may be, for example, mutated proteins. The term \"mutated\" is used herein to mean a molecule which has undergone deletion, addition or substitution of one or more amino acids using well known techniques for site directed mutagenesis or any other conventional method. For example, as described above, a mutant ply protein may be altered so that it is biologically inactive whilst still maintaining its immunogenic epitopes, see, for example, WO90/06951 , Berry et al.

The ratio of protein and polysaccharide was measured using Lowry and Resorcinol methods and the antigenicity was determined using sandwich ELISA.</p>Purification of the conjugates:</p>The conjugates were purified by gel filtration using a Sephacryl S400HR gel filtration column equilibrated with 0.15M NaCI (S500HR for 18C) to remove small molecules (including DMAP) and unconjugated PS and protein. Based on the different molecular sizes of the reaction components, PS-PD, PS-TT, PS-PhtD, PS-pneumolysin or PS-DT conjugates are eluted first, followed by free PS, then by free PD or free DT and finally DMAP and other salts (NaCI, glycine). \n\n Fractions containing conjugates are detected by UV<sub>2</sub>8o <sub>nm</sub>- Fractions are pooled according to their Kd, sterile filtered (0.22\u03bcm) and stored at +2-8\u00b0C.

    " similar magnitude for vaccine serotype pneumococci and H. influenzae (Figure 1 ). This reduction of the nasopharyngeal carriage of H. influenzae in the PD-conjugate vaccinees supports the hypothesis of a direct protective effect of the PD-conjugate vaccine against H. influenzae, even if the protective efficacy could not be correlated to the anti-PD IgG immune responses as measured by ELISA.</p>In a following experiment a chinchilla otitis media model was used with serum pools from infants immunised with the 11 valent formulation of this example or with the 10 valent vaccine of Example 2 (see also Table 1 and 2 and comments thereunder). Both pools induce a significant reduction of the percentage of animals with otitis media versus the pre-immune serum pool. There is no significant difference beteen the 10 and 1 1 valent immune pools. This demonstrates that both vaccines have a similar potential to induce protection against otitis media caused by non typeable H. influenzae in this model. \n\n</p>Table 3</p><img id=\"imgf000059_0001\" path=\"imgf000059_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/89404887/WO/20081231/A2/002009/00/08/24/imgf000059_0001.tif\"/></p>NP = Not published, N = number of subjects in ATP efficacy cohort, n = number of episodes</p>\"Vaccine pneumococcal serotypes for 11 Pn-PD = 11 serotypes, for Prevnar and 7v-OMP = 7 serotypes</p>MEF = Middle ear fluid \n\n</p>Example 4:</p>Selection of carrier protein for serotype 19F</p>ELISA assay used The 22F inhibition ELISA method was essentially based on an assay proposed in</p>2001 by Concepcion and Frasch and was reported by Henckaerts et al., 2006, Clinical and Vaccine Immunology 13:356-360. Briefly, purified pneumococcal polysaccharides were mixed with methylated human serum albumin and adsorbed onto Nunc Maxisorp\u2122 (Roskilde, DK) high binding microtitre plates overnight at 4\u00b0C. The plates were blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature with agitation. Serum samples were diluted in PBS containing 10% FBS, 10 \u03bcg/mL cell-wall polysaccharide (SSI) and 2 \u03bcg/mL of pneumococcal polysaccharide of serotype 22F (ATCC), and further diluted on the microtitre plates with the same buffer. An internal reference calibrated against the standard serum 89-SF using the serotype-specific IgG concentrations in 89-SF was treated in the same way and included on every plate. After washing, the bound antibodies were detected using peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG monoclonal antibody (Stratech Scientific Ltd., Soham, UK) diluted in 10% FBS (in PBS), and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with agitation. The color was developed using ready-to-use single component tetramethylbenzidine peroxidase enzyme immunoassay substrate kit (BioRad, Hercules, CA, US) in the dark at room temperature. The reaction was stopped with H2SO4 0.18 M, and the optical density was read at 450 nm. Serotype-specific IgG concentrations (in \u03bcg/mL) in the samples were calculated by re"
