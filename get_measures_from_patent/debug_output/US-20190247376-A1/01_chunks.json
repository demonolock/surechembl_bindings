    "ells participate in allergic inflammation, Applicants wanted to investigate the effect of the agonist specifically on ILC2s. Rag2<sup>\u2212/\u2212 </sup>GC<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice lack not only B and T cells, but NK cells and ILC2s as well. Using methods previously described by our laboratory<sup>36</sup>, Applicants adoptively transferred WT or \u03b17nAChR-deficient ILC2s into these Rag2<sup>\u2212/\u2212 </sup>GC<sup>\u2212/\u2212 </sup>mice, and then treated them with IL-33, with or without \u03b17nAChR agonist. As expected, Applicants observed a decrease of AHR and of eosinophil recruitment in mice injected with WT ILC2s in response to \u03b17nAChR treatment (FIGS. 4C-4E). However, in the absence of \u03b17nAChR expression on ILC2s, the agonist affected neither AHR nor eosinophilia. Taken together, these results indicate that engagement of \u03b17nAChR ameliorates ILC2-mediated AHR and allergic inflammation. These results, which are consistent with those seen in WT and \u03b17nAChR-deficient mice, demonstrate that the effects Applicants observed are due to ILC2s as opposed to other cells, such as structural cells, which express \u03b17nAChR.</p>\u03b17nAChR Agonist Attenuates GATA3 and NF-\u03baB Expression</p>To characterize the mechanism enabling \u03b17nAChR agonist to attenuate ILC2-mediated AHR, Applicants first investigated whether engagement of \u03b17nAChR affects the development or maintenance of pulmonary ILC2s. However, Applicants observed a significantly decreased proliferation rate of pulmonary ILC2s upon \u03b17nAChR agonist treatment by evaluating Ki-67 levels (FIG. 5A). Applicants also evaluated the expression of the transcription factor GATA binding protein-3 (GATA-3), which is essential for the development and maintenance of ILC2s<sup>37-39</sup>. Applicants found that \u03b17nAChR agonist treatment significantly inhibits GATA-3 transcription in ILC2s (FIG. 5B). This decrease in GATA-3 expression could be involved in the repressed proliferation and function of ILC2s in response to \u03b17nAChR agonist.</p>Next, to investigate the molecular mechanism of \u03b17nAChR agonist-mediated anti-inflammatory effects, Applicants analyzed the gene expression profile of ILC2s with or without \u03b17nAChR agonist treatment by NanoString technology as described in the methods. Evaluated genes were categorized and displayed in two panels; 1) genes mainly involved in the IL-33/IL-25 signaling pathway, and 2) genes associated with IL-2/IL-7 signaling pathway (FIG. 5C). As demonstrated in the IL-33/IL-25 signaling pathway, \u03b17nAChR-mediated cholinergic activity inhibited expression of GATA-3 as well as STAT-6, NF-\u03baB, IL-5, IL-9 and IL-13. Meanwhile, STAT-5a, STAT-5b, and IL-2 receptors in the IL-2/IL-7 signaling panel were relatively unaffected. Applicants also demonstrated that \u03b17nAChR agonist did not activate factors associated with apoptosis, such as Casp3, Casp8, and Bcl-2. Applicants further confirmed by flow cytometry that \u03b17nAChR agonist reduced NF-\u03baB p65 expression in ILC2s (FIG. 5D). To better establish the underlying mechanisms, Applicants expl",
