    "dron Lett. 37:743 (1996)) and non-ribose backbones, including those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,235,033 and 5,034,506, and Chapters 6 and 7, ASC Symposium Series 580, Carbohydrate Modifications in Antisense Research, Y. S. Sanghui and P. Dan Cook. Nucleic acids containing one or more carbocyclic sugars are also included within the definition of nucleic acids (see Jenkins et al. (1995), Chem. Soc. Rev. pp 169-176). Several nucleic acid analogs are described in Rawls, C &amp; E News Jun. 2, 1997 page 35. These modifications of the ribose-phosphate backbone may be done to facilitate the addition of additional moieties such as labels, or to increase the stability and half-life of such molecules in physiological environments.</p>As used herein, an \u201cantibody\u201d refers to a protein consisting of one or more polypeptides substantially encoded by immunoglobulin genes or fragments of immunoglobulin genes. The recognized immunoglobulin genes include the kappa, lambda, alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon and mu constant region genes, as well as myriad immunoglobulin variable region genes. Light chains are classified as either kappa or lambda. Heavy chains are classified as gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon, which in turn define the immunoglobulin classes, IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE, respectively.</p>A typical immunoglobulin (antibody) structural unit is known to comprise a tetramer. Each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one \u201clight\u201d (about 25 kD) and one \u201cheavy\u201d chain (about 50-70 kD). The N-terminus of each chain defines a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The terms variable light chain (V<sub>L</sub>) and variable heavy chain (V<sub>H</sub>) refer to these light and heavy chains respectively.</p>Antibodies exist as intact immunoglobulins or as a number of well characterized fragments produced by digestion with various peptidases. Thus, for example, pepsin digests an antibody below the disulfide linkages in the hinge region to produce F(ab)\u2032<sub>2</sub>, a dimer of Fab which itself is a light chain joined to V<sub>H</sub>-C<sub>H</sub>1 by a disulfide bond. The F(ab)\u2032<sub>2 </sub>may be reduced under mild conditions to break the disulfide linkage in the hinge region thereby converting the (Fab\u2032)<sub>2 </sub>dimer into a Fab\u2032 monomer. The Fab\u2032 monomer is essentially a Fab with part of the hinge region (see, Fundamental Immunology, W. E. Paul, ed., Raven Press, N.Y. (1993), for a more detailed description of other antibody fragments). While various antibody fragments are defined in terms of the digestion of an intact antibody, one of skill will appreciate that such Fab\u2032 fragments may be synthesized de novo either chemically or by utilizing recombinant DNA methodology. Thus, the term antibody, as used herein also includes antibody fragments either produced by the modification of whole antibodies or synthesized de novo using recombinant DNA methodologies. Preferred antibodies include sin",
    "rnative expression strategies have also been successful. For example Fab molecules can be displayed on phage if one of the chains (heavy or light) is fused to g3 capsid protein and the complementary chain exported to the periplasm as a soluble molecule. The two chains can be encoded on the same or on different replicons; the important point is that the two antibody chains in each Fab molecule assemble post-translationally and the dimer is incorporated into the phage particle via linkage of one of the chains to, e.g., g3p (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,733,743). The scFv antibodies and a number of other structures converting the naturally aggregated, but chemically separated light and heavy polypeptide chains from an antibody V region into a molecule that folds into a three dimensional structure substantially similar to the structure of an antigen-binding site are known to those of skill in the art (see e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,091,513, 5,132,405, and 4,956,778). Particularly preferred antibodies should include all that have been displayed on phage scFv, Fv, Fab and disulfide Fv (Reiter et al. (1995) Protein Eng. 8: 1323-4331).</p>The term \u201cspecifically binds\u201d, as used herein, when referring to a targeting ligand (e.g., protein, nucleic acid, antibody, etc.), refers to a binding reaction that is determinative of the presence of the target of the targeting ligand in a heterogeneous population of molecules (e.g., proteins and other biologics). Thus, under designated conditions (e.g. binding assay conditions), the specified ligand or preferentially binds to its particular \u201ctarget\u201d molecule and preferentially does not bind in a significant amount to other molecules present in the sample.</p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSFIG. 1 illustrates a fabrication procedure for nanowontons, Six steps are illustrated: (1) Etching polysilicon nanopillars on the surface of single crystalline silicon wafer (for simpler presentation, we omitted from the illustration the preparatory step of depositing 5 nm of chromium before going to step 2, see Methods); (2) deposition of a 10-nm gold thin film; (3) deposition of 10-nm cobalt thin film; (4) deposition of 10-nm gold thin film; (5) etching polysilicon nanopillars in KOH batch solution; and (6) complete removal of polysilicon and chromium by KOH etching and separation of nanowontons.</p>FIGS. 2A-2E show the characterization of illustrative cobalt nanowontons. FIG. 2A: Scanning electron microscopy image of nanowontons. FIG. 2B: Transmission electron microscopy image of three nanowontons in various diameters; notice that the lighter regions in the nanoparticle are relatively hollow, and are responsible for photothermal tuning properties of the nanowonton (Liu et al. (2006) Nat. Mater., 5: 27-32). FIG. 2C: Particle diameter distribution of 150 nanowontons. Because of the inhomogeneous polysilicon nanopillar diameter, the size of the nanowontons varies from 30 to 90 nm, and the average diameter is 60 nm. FIG. 2D: Absorption sp"
