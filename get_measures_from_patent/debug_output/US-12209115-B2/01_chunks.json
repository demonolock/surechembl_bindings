    "es (e.g., hormones, ligands, information transmitting substances, organic small molecules, molecules synthesized by combinatorial chemistry, small molecules that can be used as medicine (e.g., small molecule ligands and the like) and a composite molecules thereof. Typical examples of an agent specific to a polynucleotide include, but are not limited to, polynucleotides having complementarity with a certain sequence homology (e.g., 70% or greater sequence identity) to a sequence of the polynucleotide, polypeptides such as transcription factors that bind to a promoter region, and the like. Typical examples of an agent specific to a polypeptide include, but are not limited to, antibodies directed specifically to the polypeptide or a derivative or analog thereof (e.g., single chain antibody), specific ligands or receptors when the polypeptide is a receptor or ligand, substrates when the polypeptide is an enzyme, and the like.</p>Thus, an \u201cagent\u201d (or detection agent or the like) that \u201cspecifically\u201d interacts (or binds) to a biological agent such as a polynucleotide or a polypeptide as used herein encompasses agents with affinity to the biological agent such as a polynucleotide or polypeptide that is typically the same or higher, preferably significantly (e.g., statistically significantly) higher, than the affinity to other unrelated polynucleotides or polypeptides (especially those with less than 30% identity). Such affinity can be measured, for example, by a hybridization assay, binding assay or the like.</p>As used herein, \u201ctherapy\u201d refers to the prevention of exacerbation, preferably maintaining of the current condition, more preferably alleviation, and still more preferably disappearance of a disease or disorder (e.g., cerebral malaria) in case of such a condition, including being capable of exerting a prophylactic effect or an effect of improving a disease of a patient or one or more symptoms accompanying the disease. Preliminary diagnosis with suitable therapy may be referred to as \u201ccompanion therapy\u201d and a diagnostic agent therefor may be referred to as \u201ccompanion diagnostic agent\u201d.</p>As used herein, \u201ctherapeutic drug (agent)\u201d broadly refers to all agents capable of treating a condition of interest (e.g., disease such as cancer or the like), and refers to an inhibitor (e.g., antibody) provided by the present invention. In one embodiment of the present invention, \u201ctherapeutic drug\u201d may be a pharmaceutical composition comprising an active ingredient and one or more pharmacologically acceptable carriers. A pharmaceutical composition can be manufactured, for example, by mixing an active ingredient with the carriers by any method known in the technical field of pharmaceuticals. Further, mode of usage of a therapeutic drug is not limited, as long as it is used for therapy. A therapeutic drug may be an active ingredient alone or a mixture of an active ingredient and any ingredient. Further, the shape of the carriers is not particularly limited. For e"
