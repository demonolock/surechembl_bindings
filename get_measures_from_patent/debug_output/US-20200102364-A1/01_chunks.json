Cells were then counted and the density was adjusted to 3.0\u00d710<sup>5 </sup>cells/mL in RPMI 1640+10% FBS. 504 of cell suspension was seeded into each well of a 96 well round bottom tissue culture plate (hereafter, \u201cexperimental plate\u201d) (TPP, cat #92067). Cells were incubated at 4\u00b0 C. for 1 hour prior to the addition of test compounds. On a separate, sterile 96 well plate (hereafter, \u201cdilution plate\u201d; Costar, Corning, N.Y. cat #3879), test articles were serially diluted in duplicate in RPMI 1640+10% FBS. 50 4/well was transferred from the dilution plate to the experimental plate. The experimental plate was then incubated for four days at 37\u00b0 C. with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. A \u201cCELLTITER-GLO\u00ae reagent 2.0\u201d, was added to the experimental plate at 100 \u03bcL/well.

The effect on cell proliferation was investigated by comparing A10.21 anti-CD38 antibody fused to attenuated IFN\u03b12b with and without O-linked glycosylation. Removal of the O-linked glycosylation site in the attenuated IFN portion of the antibody fusion constructs resulted in increased anti-proliferative activity as shown by lower IC50 (nM) relative to the corresponding O-linked glycosylated fusion proteins i.e. A10.21 IgG4 (S228P) IFN (A145D, T106T) and A10.21 IgG1 IFN (A145D, T106T) in both ARP1 (FIG. 1A) and NCI-H929 cells (FIG. 1B).

    " test articles were transferred from the dilution plate to the assay plate. The assay plate was then incubated at 37\u00b0 C. with 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>for 17 hours. The manufacturer-supplied assay buffer and substrate were removed from the \u221280\u00b0 C. freezer and allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for two hours. The manufacturer-supplied assay buffer was added to the manufacturer-supplied substrate vial and mixed well according to the manufacturer's instructions to create the \u201cluminescence solution.\u201d Then, 100 \u03bcL of the luminescence solution was added to each well of the assay plate. The plate was shaken for 2 minutes. The plate was then incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes in the dark and read on a Victor 3V Multilabel Counter on a luminometry channel and the luminescence measured and presented as RLU.</p>To test the off-target activity of anti-CD38 antibody-IFN fusion protein constructs in the iLite assay, manufacturer-supplied diluent was supplemented with 0.25 mg/mL anti-CD38 antibody (an antibody recognizing the same epitope on CD38 as the antibody-IFN fusion protein construct being tested, to block any binding of the anti-CD38 antibody-IFN fusion protein constructs to the CD38 expressed on the iLite cells). This blocking stage was followed by treatment with anti-CD38 antibody-IFN fusion protein or IFN\u03b12b.</p>Data was analyzed using Prism 5 (Graphpad, San Diego, Calif.) using non-linear regression and three parameter curve fit to determine the midpoint of the curve (EC50). Selectivity Index (SI) was calculated by EC50 (OFF-target activity)/EC50 (ON-target activity). Selectivity Index (SI) is a measure of how selectively active anti-CD38 IFN constructs are against CD38-expressing cells and non-active in cells with no CD38. The larger the number the more selective it is against the target, while a number close to 1 indicates that there is no selectivity against the target.
