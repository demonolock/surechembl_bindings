In some embodiments, vascular endothelial cells internalize sweeping antibodies, or antigen-binding portions thereof, which in some embodiments are hound to an antigen such as myostatin (e.g., pro-myostatin, latent myostatin or primed myostatin). In some embodiments, a sweeping antibody, or an antigen-binding portion thereof, is recycled back into the bloodstream. In some embodiments, a sweeping antibody, or an antigen-binding portion thereof, has an increased half-life (e.g., in the serum of a subject) as compared to its conventional counterpart. In some embodiments, a conventional counterpart of a sweeping antibody refers the antibody, or an antigen-binding portion thereof, from which the sweeping antibody, or an antigen-binding portion thereof, was derived (e.g., prior to engineering the Fc portion of the conventional antibody to bind FcRn with greater affinity at pH 7). In some embodiments, a sweeping antibody, or an antigen-binding portion thereof, has a half-life in the serum of a subject that is at least 1%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 35%, 50%, 75%, 100%, 150%, 200% or 250% longer as compared to its conventional counterpart.</p>In some embodiments, an Fc portion of a sweeping antibody binds FcRn.

In some embodiments, any of the antibodies, or antigen binding fragments thereof, provided herein may be converted into a sweeping antibody using any suitable method.

It should be appreciated, however, that the methods for making sweeping antibodies, or an antigen-binding portion thereof, as provided herein are not meant to be limiting. Thus, additional methods for making sweeping antibodies, or an antigen-binding portion thereof, are within the scope of this disclosure.</p>Some aspects of the disclosure are based on the recognition that the affinity (e.g., as expressed as Kd) of any of the anti-pro/latent-myostatin antibodies, or antigen binding fragments thereof, provided herein are sensitive to changes in pH. In some embodiments, the antibodies, or antigen binding fragments thereof, provided herein have an increased Kd of binding to pro/latent-myostatin at a relatively low pH (e.g., a pH ranging from 4.0-6.5) as compared to a relatively high pH (e.g., a pH ranging from 7.0-7.4). In some embodiments, the antibodies, or antigen binding fragments thereof, provided herein have a Kd of binding to pro/latent-myostatin ranging from 10<sup>\u22123 </sup>M, 10<sup>\u22124 </sup>M, 10<sup>\u22125 </sup>M, 10<sup>\u22126 </sup>M, 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M when the pH is between 4.0 and 6.5.

Regardless of the mechanism by which such competition or cross-competition occurs (e.g., steric hindrance, conformational change, or binding to a common epitope, or portion thereof), the skilled artisan would appreciate that such competing and/or cross-competing antibodies are encompassed and can be useful for the methods and/or compositions provided herein.</p>Aspects of the disclosure relate to antibodies, or antigen-binding portions thereof, that compete or cross-compete with any of the antibodies, or antigen binding fragments thereof, provided herein. In some embodiments, an antibody, or an antigen-binding portion thereof, binds at or near the same epitope as any of the antibodies provided herein. In some embodiments, an antibody, or an antigen-binding portion thereof, binds near an epitope if it binds within 15 or fewer amino acid residues of the epitope.

In other embodiments, an antibody, or an antigen-binding portion thereof, competes or cross-competes for binding to any of the antigens provided herein with a Kd in a range from 10<sup>\u221211 </sup>M to 10<sup>\u22126 </sup>M.</p>Aspects of the disclosure relate to antibodies, or antigen-binding portions thereof, that compete for binding to pro/latent-myostatin with any of the antibodies, or antigen binding fragments thereof, provided herein. In some embodiments, the antibody, or an antigen-binding portion thereof, binds to pro/latent-myostatin at the same epitope as any of the antibodies, or antigen-binding portions thereof, provided herein. For example, in some embodiments any of the antibodies provided herein bind at or near a tolloid cleavage site or at or near a tolloid docking site of pro/latent-myostatin. In other embodiments, any of the antibodies, or antigen binding fragments thereof, provided herein bind at or near a proprotein convertase cleavage site or at or near a proprotein convertase docking site of pro/latent-myostatin.

In other embodiments, the antibody, or antigen-binding portion thereof, that competes with any of the antibodies, or antigen-binding portions thereof, provided herein binds to pro/latent-myostatin with a Kd in ranging from 10<sup>\u221211 </sup>M to 10<sup>\u22126 </sup>M.</p>Any of the antibodies, or antigen binding fragments thereof, provided herein can be characterized using any suitable methods. For example, one method is to identify the epitope to which the antigen binds, or \u201cepitope mapping.\u201d There are many suitable methods for mapping and characterizing the location of epitopes on proteins, including solving the crystal structure of an antibody-antigen complex, competition assays, gene fragment expression assays, and synthetic peptide-based assays, as described, for example, in Chapter 11 of Harlow and Lane, Using Antibodies, a Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1999. In an additional example, epitope mapping can be used to determine the sequence to which an antibody, or an antigen-binding portion thereof, binds. The epitope can be a linear epitope, i.e., contained in a single stretch of amino acids, or a conformational epitope formed by a three-dimensional interaction of amino acids that may not necessarily be contained in a single stretch (primary structure linear sequence). Peptides of varying lengths (e.g., at least 4-6 amino acids long) can be isolated or synthesized (e.g., recombinantly) and used for binding assays with an antibody. In another example, the epitope to which the antibody, or an antigen-binding portion thereof, binds can be determined in a systematic screen by using overlapping peptides derived from the target an"
