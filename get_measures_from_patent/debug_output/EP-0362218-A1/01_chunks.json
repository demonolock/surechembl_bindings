    "wever, to our knowledge there is no suggestion in the prior art as to any possible effect (s) of VWF or phospholipid on the in vitro production of Factor VIII:c-type proteins (where, for example, thrombin is substantially absent) or any suggestion of media supplements for the production of Factor VIII:c comprising VWF or a VWF-type protein and/or phospholipids either substantially free from the complex mixture of components present in mammalian serum or in concentrations higher than afforded by 10% serum supplements in accordance with this invention. It should be noted that mammalian serum contains VWF. As a point of reference, conventional media for mammalian cells which contains about 10% serum, contains about lug VWF/ml media.</p>Summary of the Invention</p>This invention concerns an improved method for the production of Factor VIII:c-type proteins.</p>\"Factor VIII : c-type\" proteins, as the term is used herein, means proteins exhibiting Factor VIII:c-type procoagulant activity. Factor VIII:c-type proteins within the ambit of \n\n this invention are encoded for by DNA sequences capable of hybridizing to DNA encoding Factor VIII:c under conditions that avoid hybridization to non-Factor VIII:c genes, eg, under conditions equivalent to 65 C in 5 X SSC (1 X SSC = 150 mM NaCl/ 0.15 M Na citrate). In addition to natural mammalian, e.g. human. Factor VIII:c, Factor VIII:c-type proteins include, for example, proteins which contain deletions of one or more amino acids between the 90 Kd and 69 Kd cleavage sites with respect to native Factor VIII:c, as described in greater detail in International Application No. PCT/US86/00774, published 23 October 1986. Factor VIII:c-type proteins also include Factor VIII:c analogs containing deletion (s) of one or more amino acids between the 50/40 cleavage site and the 69 Kd cleavage site which may be produced by methods analogous to those disclosed in PCT/US86/00774. Factor VIII:c-type proteins further include analogs (with or without deletions as mentioned above) wherein one or more of the cleavage sites spanning arginine residues at positions 226, 336, 562, 740, 776, 1313, 1648 or 1721 have been rendered resistant to proteolytic cleavage, e.g., by replacement of one or more amino acids-with different amino acids by conventional site-directed mutagenesis of the cDNA to be expressed. Factor VIII:c-type proteins thus include natural Factor VIII:c, \"recombinant\" Factor VIII:c and analogs thereof having procoagulant activity, and non-recombinant Factor VIII:c or analogs thereof produced by cell lines derived from cells which produce the protein.</p>The method of this invention thus utilizes mammalian cells which contain DNA encoding a Factor VIII:c-type protein and which are capable of expressing the protein. In accordance with the method of this invention the cells are cultured in media containing an effective amount of a stabilizing substance for a Factor VIII:c-type protein. Such substances include: (i) a VWF-type protein; (ii) a stabilizing \n\nphospholipid or phospholipid mixture; and (iii) mixtures containing a VWF-type protein and phospholipid(s). Although termed \"stabilizing substances\", it should be understood that VWF-type proteins may possess, in addition to a stabilizing effect on Factor VIII:c-type proteins, other effects which result"
