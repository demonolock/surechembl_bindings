    "des. The gene may constitute an uninterrupted coding sequence or it may include one or more introns, bound by the appropriate splice junctions.</p>[051] As used herein, the terms \"label\" and \"detectable label\" refer to a molecule capable of detection, including, but not limited to, radioactive isotopes, fluorophores, chemiluminescent moieties, enzymes, enzyme substrates, enzyme cofactors, enzyme inhibitors, dyes, metal ions, ligands (e.g., biotin or haptens), and the like. The term \"fluorescer\" refers to a substance or a portion thereof which is capable of exhibiting fluorescence in the detectable range. Examples of labels which may be used in the present invention include fluorescein, rhodamine, dansyl, umbelliferone, Texas red, luminol, NADPH, alpha - beta -galactosidase, and horseradish peroxidase.</p>[052] The term \"patient\" or \"subject\" as used herein includes mammals (e.g., humans and animals).</p>[053] The \"profile\" of a cell's biological state refers to the levels of various constituents of a cell that are known to change in response to drug treatments and other perturbations of the biological state of the cell. Constituents of a cell include, for example, levels of RNA, levels of protein or protein activity, or phosphorylation levels.</p>[054] The term \"protein,\" \"polypeptide,\" and \"peptide\" are used interchangeably herein when referring to a gene product.</p>[055] \"Small molecule,\" as used herein, refers to a composition with a molecular weight of less than about 5 kD and most preferably less than about 4 D. Small molecules can be nucleic acids, peptides, polypeptides, peptidomimetics, carbohydrates, lipids, or other organic or inorganic molecules. Many pharmaceutical companies have extensive libraries of chemical and/or biological mixtures, often fungal, bacterial, or algal extracts, which can be screened with any of the assays of the invention to identify compounds that modulate a bioactivity.</p>[056] A \"variant\" of polypeptide refers to a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence in which one or more amino acid residues is altered. The variant may have \"conservative\" changes, wherein a substituted amino acid has similar structural or chemical properties (e.g., replacement of leucine with isoleucine). A variant may also have \"nonconservative\" changes (e.g., replacement of \n\nglycine with tryptophan). Analogous minor variations may include amino acid deletions or insertions, or both. Guidance in determining which amino acid residues may be substituted, inserted, or deleted without abolishing biological or immunological activity may be identified using computer programs well known in the art, for example, LASERGENE software (DNASTAR).</p>[057] The present invention relates to the use of phospho-ERK (pERK) levels in tumor cells as a biomarker for a Raf kinase inhibitor (see, e.g., Wilhelm, et al., Cancer Res. 64:7099-7109, 2004, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).</p>[058] The methods of the present invention are ",
    " metastases are more readily accessible.</p>Biological markers in clinical medicine</p>[062] The identification of tumor characteristics or biomolecules that may be utilized as surrogate markers to predict the clinical response of an individual patient to a particular treatment (medicine response markers) and to identify those subjects most likely to respond favorably to a given treatment as well as those who are not likely to respond (and who should thus be considered for alternative treatments) will be of assistance in clinical practice. Additionally, such markers may be used in clinical trials to identify groups of patients that respond (or do not respond) to a particular therapy and to identify traits and phenotypes common to responders and non-responders.</p>[063] Anderson, et al., (Ins. J. Cancer 94:774, 2001) report that the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ZD1839 inhibited the proliferation of human cancer cell lines both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, reductions in tumor growth rates (SKOV3 and MDA-MB-231 xenografts in mice) were reported to coincide with inhibition of constitutive ERK MAP kinase activation. Preincubation of cells with ZD1839 was also reported to block EGF-induced increases in activation of ERK MAP kinases and PKB/Akt in SKOV (human ovarian cancer) cells.</p>[064] Albanell, et al., (Semin. Oncol. 28(5Suppl. 16):56-66, 2001) report that administration of ZD1839 to humans in clinical trials resulted in decreased expression of both activated MAPK and Ki-67 in keratinocytes (assessed in biopsies of normal skin taken prior to and following ZD1839 administration; the basal layer of epidermis has high levels of EGF receptor expression). Albanell, et al., (J. Clin. Oncol. 20:4292-4302, 2002) also reported that serial skin biopsies taken before treatment and at approximately day 28 of treatment indicated inhibition of the EGFR signaling pathway.</p>[065] Albanell, et al., (Cancer Res. 61:6500-6510, 2001) reported that in patients treated with a chimeric anti-EGF receptor antibody (Cetux nab; C225), activation of ERK1 and ERK2 in skin was lower compared to control (non-patient) skin.</p>[066] It has been reported that ERK1 and ERK2 (ERKl/2) can prime Estrogen Receptor (ER) signalling via phosphorylation of the ER, and that exaggerated ERKl/2 MAPK activity might be capable of driving ER signaling and thus, tumor growth in the absence of estrogen (phenotypically \n\nevidenced as hormone resistance in the tumor) (see, e.g., Coutts &amp; Murphy, Cancer Res. 58:4071- 4074, 1998). Gee, et al, (Ins. J. Cancer (Pred. Oncol) 95:247-254, 2001) reported that in a collection of breast cancer tissue samples, pMAPK positive status was found in 83% of ER negative breast cancers; and that increased ERKl/2 MAPK phosphorylation was associated with earlier relapse and reduced survival time in both ER negative and ER positive disease.</p>[067] Most mitogenic signals transduced through growth factor receptor activation ultimately converge on a common "
