{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that meet the specified criteria, as none of the sentences contain a specific molecule name, a bioactivity metric (IC50, Ki, Kd, EC50), a numeric value for that metric, and a unit for that value. The text appears to be descriptive of experimental methods and results, but does not include specific bioactivity data."}
{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that meet the specified criteria. The text does not contain any sentences with a specific molecule name, ID, or other identifier, a bioactivity metric (IC50, Ki, Kd, EC50, etc.), a specific numeric value for that metric, and a unit for that value. The text appears to be focused on describing methods for expressing and purifying recombinant proteins, but does not provide any specific bioactivity data."}
{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that contain all four required components: a specific molecule name, a bioactivity metric (IC50, Ki, Kd, EC50), a specific numeric value for that metric, and a unit for that value. The text primarily discusses the detection and expression of the 36P6D5 protein in human cancers, but it does not provide specific bioactivity metrics with numeric values and units."}
