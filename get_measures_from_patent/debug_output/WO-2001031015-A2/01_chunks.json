    "ine. The 36P6D5 gene is also expressed in several human cancer xenografts and cell lines derived from prostate, breast, ovarian and colon cancers, in some cases at high levels. Over-expression of 36P6D5, relative to normal, is observed in prostate cancer xenografts initially derived from a prostate cancer lymph node metastasis and passaged intratibially and \n\nsubcutaneously in SCID mice. Extremely high level expression of 36P6D5 is detected m the breast cancer cell line DU4475, a cell line that was initially derived from a mammary gland carcinoma (Langlois et al., 1979, Cancer Res. 39: 2604). The 36P6D5 gene is also expressed in tumor patient samples derived from bladder, kidney, colon and lung cancers, m some cases at high levels.</p>A full length 36P6D5 cDNA of 931 bp (SEQ ID NO: 1) provided herein encodes a 235 amino acid open reading frame (SEQ ID NO: 2) with significant homology to the 2-19 protem precursor (Genbank P98173) as well as a gene previously cloned from human osteoblasts (Q92520). The predicted 235 amino acid 36P6D5 protem also contams an N-terminal signal sequence, indicating that the 36P6D5 protem is secreted. The 36P6D5 gene therefore encodes a secreted tumor antigen which may be useful as a diagnostic, staging and/or prognostic marker for, and/or may serve as a target for various approaches to the treatment of, prostate, breast, colon, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers expressmg 36P6D5. The predicted molecular weight of the 36P6D5 protem is approximately 26 kD and its' pi is 8 97.</p>Expression analysis demonstrates high levels of 36P6D5 expression m several prostate and other cancer cell hnes as well as prostate cancer patient samples and tumor xenografts. The expression profile of 36P6D5 in normal adult tissues, combmed with the over-expression observed in cancer cells such as bladder, colon, kidney, breast, lung, ovary and prostate cancer cell lines and/or cancer patient samples, provides evidence that 36P6D5 is aberrandy expressed m at least some cancers, and can serve as a useful diagnostic and/or therapeutic target for such cancers.</p>The mvention provides polynucleotides corresponding or complementary to all or part of the 36P6D5 genes, mRNAs, and/or coding sequences, preferably m isolated form, including polynucleotides encoding 36P6D5 protems and fragments thereof, DNA, RNA, DNA/RNA hybrid, and related molecules, polynucleotides or oligonucleotides complementary to the 36P6D5 genes or mRNA sequences or parts thereof, and polynucleotides or oligonucleotides that hybridize to the 36P6D5 genes, mRNAs, or to 36P6D5-encoding polynucleotides.

In particular, the highest level of expression was detected in the breast cancer ceU line DU4475.</p>EXAMPLE 4: PRODUCTION AND PURIFICATION OF RECOMBINANT 36P6D5</p>To express recombinant 36P6D5 for use in a number of contexts such as analyzing the subceUular localization of 36P6D5 protein, a partial or the full length \n\ncDNA can cloned into any one of a variety of expression vectors such as those that provide a 6His tag at the carboxyl-terminus (e.g. pCDNA 3.1 myc-his, InVitrogen).</p>In a typical embodiment, in order to drive high level expression of 36P6D5 protein, the 36P6D5 cDNA encoding amino acids 30-235 (minus N-terminal signal sequence) was cloned into the pAPTag5 mammalian secretion vector (GenHuntcr) with and without fusion to the provided alkaline phosphatase (AP) cDNA sequence. This vector provides a C-terminal 6XHis and MYC tag for purification and detection and an N-terminal Ig leader sequence to drive secretion. 293T ceUs stably expressing either pAPTag5-36P6D5 or pTag5-36P6D5 (not fused to AP) serve as a source of recombinant protein for purification as visuahzed by an anti-His Western blot of conchtioned media from these ceU lines (FIG. 5). The HIS-tagged 36P6D5 proteins present in the conditioned media are purified using the foUowing method. Conditioned media is concentrated 5-10 fold and simultaneously buffer exchanged into a phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 500 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole (buffer A) using an amicon ultrafiltration unit with a 10 kd MW cutoff membrane. The prep is batch bound to 0.1 to 0.5 ml of nickel metal affinity resin (Ni-NTA, Qiagen) and washed extensively with buffer A. The HIS-tagged SGP-28/CRISP-3 protein is then eluted with a 0 to 400 mM gradient of imidazole in phosphate buffer (pH 6.3) containing 300 mM NaCl and then dialyzed extensively against PBS. The purified protein may then be used for growth assays, hgand binding studies, or as immunogen for generating antibody reagents. Additional embodiments of typical constructs are provided below. pcDNA3.1 /MycHis Construct</p>To express 36P6D5 in mammahan ceUs, the 705 bp (235 amino acid) 36P6D5 ORF was cloned into pcDNA3.1 /MycHis_Version A (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Protein expression is driven from the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. The recombinant protein has the myc and six histidines fused to the C-terminus. The pcDNA3.1/MycHis vector also contains the bovine growth hormone (BGH) polyadenylation signal and transcription termination sequence to enhance mRNA stability along with the SV40 origin for episomal replication and simple vector rescue in ceU lines expressing the large T antigen. The Neomycin resistance gene aUows for selection of mammalian ceUs expressing the protein and the ampicillin resistance gene and ColEl origin permits selection and maintenance of the plasmid in E. coh. \n\npAPtag</p>The 36P6D5 protein without the signal sequence (amino acids 30 to 235) was cloned into pAPtag-5 (GenHunter Corp.

Conditioned media and/or ceU lysates from a variety of cancer ceU hnes representing cancers derived from prostate (LAPC4 xenograft), colon (Colo 205, CaCo- 1), breast (Du4475), and pancreatic (Ca\u03c1an-1) tissues, as weU as PC3 prostate cancer ceUs engineered to overexpress 36P6D5 protein, were subjected to Western analysis using an anti-36P6D5 murme pAb. Briefly, ceUs (~25 ug total protem) and conditioned media (25 ul of neat, 0 22 uM filtered media) were solubihzed m SDS-PAGE sample buffer and separated on a 10-20% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitroceUulose. Blots were blocked m Tris-buffered saline (TBS) + 3% non-fat milk and then probed with a 1:1,000 dilution (m TBS + 0.15% Tween-20 + 1% milk) of serum derived from mice immunized with purified 36P6D5 protem Blots were then washed and mcubated with a 1:4,000 dilution of anti-mouse IgG-HRP conjugated secondary antibody. FoUowmg washing, anti-36P6D5 immunoreactive bands were developed and visuahzed by enhanced chereuluminescence and exposure to autoradiographic film. The specific anti-36P6D5 immunoreactive bands representing endogenous 36P6D5 protem are indicated with arrows and run approximately between 35 and 40 kD. The molecular weight of 36P6D5 calculated from the ammo acid sequence is 26 kD suggesting that endogenous 36P6D5 protem is post-translationaUy modified, possibly by glycosylation. These results demonstrate that 36P6D5 may be useful as a diagnostic and therapeutic target for prostate, colon, breast, pancreatic and potentiaUy other human cancers. \n\n As shown in Figure 10, a sensitive and specific capture ELISA detects 36P6D5 protem m supernatants of human cancer ceU hnes. A capture ELISA was developed usmg protem G purified murine anti-36P6D5 pAb as capture Ab and a biounylated form of the same pAb as detection Ab Briefly, 1 ug of purified murine anti-36P6D5 pAb was used to coat weUs of an ELISA plate. FoUowmg blocking with PBS contammg 3% milk, 50 ul of conditioned media from either PC3-neo, PC3-36P6D5, or DU4475 ceUs or various amounts of purified Tag5-36P6D5 protem spiked mto tissue culture media were added to weUs and mcubated for 2 hours at room temperature. WeUs were washed 4X with PBS+0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-T) and lx with PBS. WeUs were then mcubated for 1 hour with 3 ug/ml of biotinylated ant\u03b9-36O6D5 pAb in PBS-T+1% milk (TBS-TM, 50 ul/weU) and washed as above. WeUs were then mcubated with 50 ul of a 1:8,000 dilution of avidin-HRP complex (Neutrahte <sup>IM</sup>, Southern Biotechnology, Inc) m TBS-TM for 1 hour. FoUowing washing, weUs were then developed by addition of 200 ul of TMB substrate The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 ul of IM H2SO4 and optical densities of weUs were read at 450 nM. Shown is the standard curve generated usmg the Tag5-36P6D5 protem and specific detection and quantitation of 36P6D5 present m supernatants derived from PC-3 ceUs overexpressmg 36P6D5 and endogenous 36P6D5 protem secreted by Du4475 breast cancer ceUs.</p>Figure 11 also shows 36P6D5 expression m human cancers As shown m Figure 11, m a typical method for detecting expression of 36P6D5 m human cancers, ceU lysates from Colon, breast and kidney cancer tissues (Ca), as weU as their normal matched adjacent tissues (N) were subjected to Western analysis using an anti-36P6D5 mouse monoclonal antibody. Briefly, tissues (~25 ug total protem) were solubihzed m SDS- PAGE sample buffer and separated on a 10-20% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitroceUulose.
