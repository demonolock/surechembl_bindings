    " monophosphoryl lipid A.</p>In an embodiment, there is provided a method of producing a vaccine as herein described in an oil in water carrier wherein an oil in water emulsion is microfluidized to provide sub micron particles in said emulsion and mixed with gpl60 or immunological derivative thereof and 3D MPL.</p>Typically the 3D-MPL is premixed with the emulsion, thereafter the antigen is mixed into the resulting composition.</p>3D-MPL may be obtained by the methods disclosed in British Patent 2211502.</p>Suitable carriers in this context, comprise oil in water emulsions. The formulations of the present invention provide enhanced neutralising titres when compared with conventional vaccine formulations comprising, alum alone as the adjuvant (the only adjuvant licensed for human use) .</p>The term immunological derivatives is used herein to include immunogenic fragments of gp 160 which when adjuvanted with 3D Monophosphoryl lipid A are capable of raising neutralising antibodies against HIV-1. As such this will include, for example the HIV-1 outer membrane glycoprotein gp 120, modified gp 160 as herein described as well as the naturally occurring isolated gp 160. Particularly preferred are those derivatives which are also able to raise a DTH response. \n\n Thus most preferably the invention provides the modified form of the protein in oligomeric form which when purified under gentle, non-reducing conditions is shown to have an apparent molecular weight of between 600-700 KDa 640 Kd and is believed to be a tetramer. This tetramer may be destabilised by running the protein on SDS gel under non- reducing conditions, which then provides a dimer of 330 kd and a monomer. The dimer may further be reduced under standard reducing conditions to yield the monomer.</p>All these forms of the gpl60 may be used in the formulations of the present invention.</p>The production of gp 160 or derivatives thereof may be achieved by methods known in the art. Typically this will involve the cloning and expression of the gene encoding for gp 160 in a suitable host. The production of recombinant gp 160 (rgp 160) in such ways may be achieved using the techniques described in Maniatis et al; Molecular Cloning - A laboratory Manual; Cold Spring Harbour 1982.</p>A variety of eukaryotic cells and expression systems are available for expression of the recombinant DNA molecules. The most widely used among these are yeast, insect and mammalian systems, although the invention is not limited to use of these. Such systems employ a recombinant DNA molecule of the invention, optionally a selection marker and, in some cases, maintenance functions such as an origin of replication.</p>Insect cells which can be used in the invention include Drosophila cells and Lepidoptera cells. Useful Drosophila cells include SI, S2 , S3, KC-O and D. hydei cells. See, for example, Schneider et al., J. Embryo1. EXP. Morph. 27;353 (1972); Schulz et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 83;9428 (1986); Sinclair et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 5:3208 (1985). \n\nDrosophila cells are transfected by standard techniques, including calcium phosphate precipitation, cell fusion, electroporation and vi"
