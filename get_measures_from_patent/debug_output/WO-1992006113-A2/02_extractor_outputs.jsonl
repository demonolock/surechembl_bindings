{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that meet the specified criteria. The text does not contain any sentences with a specific molecule name, a bioactivity metric (IC50, Ki, Kd, EC50), a numeric value, and a unit. \n\nHowever, there is a mention of a molecular weight with a unit:\nThus most preferably the invention provides the modified form of the protein in oligomeric form which when purified under gentle, non-reducing conditions is shown to have an apparent molecular weight of between 600-700 KDa 640 Kd \n\nNote that \"KDa\" and \"Kd\" are used here, but \"Kd\" in this context refers to kilodalton, a unit of molecular weight, not the bioactivity metric Kd."}
