    "e antibody with the drug attached may be made up into a pharmaceutical composition ready for use, comprising the drug-antibody combination either alone or in the presence of a pharmaceuticaly acceptble carrier. The pharmaceutical carrier in which the composition is suspended or dissolved may be any solvent or solid that is non-toxic to the inoculated animal and chemcially compatable with the drug-antibody complex. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers include liquid carriers, such as normal saline and other non- toxic salts at or near physiological concentrations, and solid carriers, such as talc or sucrose. Having now generally described this invention, the same will be better understood by reference to certain specific examples which are included herein for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to be limiting of the invention or any embodiment thereof, unless specified.</p>\n  Example 1.</p>\n  Female BALB/c mice were injected with membrane rich preparations isolated f om Brugia malayi. The membrane preparations were obtained by disrupting the parasites with freeze-thawing and homogenization, followed by subfractionation by differential centrif gation. The method of fusion was that of Kennett et al, in Current Topics in Microbiology and</p>\n  OMPI \n\nImmunology, Vol. 81, 77, Melchers et al, eds . , Springer-Verlag, New York (1978), which is herein incorporated by reference. Antibody production was evaluated between days 14 to 17 after fusion by an indirect radioactive binding assay utilizing filarial antigen preparations. The adult or larval parasite forms or eggs were isolated and disrupted by freeze- thawing and homogenization. The membranous and soluble fraction (100,000 x g supernatant) were hydrophobically attached to polyvinylchloride \"U\" bottom microliter plates or attached to polylysine-coated (M.W. 150,000) \"U\" bottom microliter plates and used for assay after blocking remaining sites with fetal calf sera. Culture supernatants (25 \u03bcl)were inocubated overnight at 5\u00b0C. The plates were then washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% fetal calf serum. Then <sup>3</sup>I-rabbit anti-mouse F(ab' )<sub>2*</sub> 10 /cpm in 25 \u03bcl of assay buffer, was added to each well, and the plates were again incubated overnight at 5\u00b0C. The plates were then washed five times, dried, and the wells cut out and counted.</p>\n  The results of one fusion, in which mice immunized with B. malayi microfilarial served as the spleen cell donors can be summarized as follows. Ey solid phase radioimmunoassay using saline extracts of distinct parasite stages as the source of antigens, 11 of 28 established clones produced antibody that reacts with an antigen present only on microfilariae, 15 with antigens shared by third stage larvae and adult worms, and 2 with antigens shared by infective third stage larvae and microfilarviae. Similar results are shown in the following Table which summarizes the results of a serparate experiment. Cross reactivity w"
