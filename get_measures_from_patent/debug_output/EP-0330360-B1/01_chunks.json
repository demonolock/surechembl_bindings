    " 22-34g body weight were used. Animals were allowed food and water ad libitum and were randomized into groups of 10 prior to experimentation. Before administration of the test compound, the reaction time of each animal was determined by focusing a beam of light onto the tail, eliciting a reflex withdrawal after a certain latency; only mice exhibiting a latency between 3-8 sec. were used subsequently in the evaluation of drug effects.</p>Test compounds were dissolved in either distilled water or distilled water plus 0.1 M AMS and administered by the subcutaneous route in a final volume of 10 ml/Kg. Control animals received 10 ml/kg of the appropriate vehicle alone. Following a pretreatment period of 30 min., the mice were again placed under the heat source and the reaction tine re-determined.</p>Percentage quantal protection was determined as the number of mice in which the reaction time was doubled compared to pretreatment values, expressed as a percentage of the total number of mice in the group.</p>RECEPTOR AFFINITY STUDYTissue preparationRadio receptor binding to \u00b5 and K sites is performed on fresh guinea pig brain homogenate prepared according to Kosterlitz. (1981).</p>Whole brain without cerebellum is homogenized in 50 mM, Tris-buffer (pH 7.4 at 0\u00b0C) and centrifuged at 49,000 x g x 10 min.</p>The pellet is then resuspended in the same buffer, incubated at 37\u00b0C for 45 min. and centrifuged again.</p>1.9ml of the final homogenate (1:100 in Tris-pH 7.4, 0\u00b0C) is used for the binding assay.</p>Binding to \u00b5 sites (Magnan J., 1982)\u00b3H [D-Ala\u00b2, MePhe\u2074, Gly-ol\u2075] Enkephalin (\u00b3H-DAGO), an enkephalin analogue that binds selectively to \u00b5 receptor, is added to the biological substrate and incubated at 25\u00b0C for 40 min., filtered through Whatman GF-C and washed with ice-cold Tris-buffer.</p>The filters are then dryed, solubilized in Filtercount and the radioactivity monitored. Non specific binding is determined in the presence of 10\u207b\u2076M Naloxone.</p>Binding to K sites (Magnan J., 1982)The binding to the K-sites is performed using \u00b3H-Ethyl Ketocyclazocine, a non-selective benzomorphan compound which binds to \u00b5, \u03b4 and K-sites, in the presence of 100nM of unlabelled DAGO and 100nM of the enkephalin analogue [DAla\u00b2-DLeu\u2075]Enkephalin (DADLE), to prevent \u00b5 and \u03b4 binding respectively.</p>Final homogenate with solutions of the cold ligand and of the labelled ligand is incubated for 40 min. at 25\u00b0C, filtered through Whatman GF/C glass filter discs and washed.\nThe radioactivity bound to the filters is counted by liquid scintillation spectrophotometry.</p>The non-specific binding is determined in the presence of 500nM of the benzomorphan non-selective compound Mr 2266.</p>Binding to \u03b4 sites (Magnan J., 1982)For binding experiments, \u00b3H-DADLE, which binds to \u00b5 and \u03b4 sites, is used in the presence of 30nm of unlabelled DAGO to prevent \u00b5 binding. A concentration of radioligand near KD is used in the binding assays evaluating compounds of the invention. Non-specific binding is determined by addition of Mr 2266 2.5\u00b5M.</p>The tubes are incubated for 40 min at 25\u00b0C and bound ligand is separated from free by filtration through Whatman GF/G filters. The level of bound radioactivity on the filters is measured by liquid scintillation after solubilization in Filtercount.</p>The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) and the maximum binding capacity (Bmax) are determined from the analysis of saturation curves, while the inhibition constant (Ki) is determined from the analysis of competition experiments (Hill 1910; Scatchard 1949; Cheng and Prusoff 1973; Gillan et al. 1980).</p>Published references are summarised as follows:\nHill, A.V.
