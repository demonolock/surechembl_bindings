    "ds of the invention was determined using a battery of distinct PDE isoenzymes as follows:</p>PDE I, rabbit heart PDE II, rabbit heart in. PDE III, rabbit heart</p>IV. PDE IV, HL60 ceils.</p>The enzymes were purified to kinetic homogeneity using standard chromatographic techniques.</p>Phosphodiesterase activity was assayed as follows. The reaction was conducted in 150\u03bcl of standard mixture containing (final concentrations): 50mM TES-NaOH buffer (pH 7.5), 10mM MgCI<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 \u03bcM [<sup>3</sup>H]-cAMP and vehicle or various concentrations of the test compounds. The reaction was initiated by addition of enzyme and \n\n conducted at 30\u00b0C for between 5 to 30 mins. The reaction was terminated by addition of 50\u03bcl 2% trifiuoroacetic acid containing [<sup>1</sup> C]- 5'AMP for determining recovery of the product. An aliquot of the sample was then applied to a column of neutral alumina and the [<sup>3</sup>H]- cAMP eluted with 10ml 0.1 TES-NaOH buffer (pH8). The [<sup>3</sup>H]-5'-AMP product was eluted with 2ml 2M NaOH into a scintillation vial containing 10ml of scintillation cocktail. Recovery of [<sup>3</sup>H]-5'AMP was determined using the [<sup>14</sup>C]-5'AMP and all assays were conducted in the linear range of the reaction.</p>Compounds according to the invention were able to inhibit the action of the PDE IV HL60 enzyme at concentrations at which they had little or no effect on the action of each of the other PDE isoenzymes. Thus, compounds of the Examples have approximate Ki values (Ki PDE IV HL60 at (1\u03bcM) in the pM-\u03bcM range, for example the compounds of Examples 1 and 3 have approximate Ki values of 391 nM and 179nM respectively.</p>2. The Elevation of cAMP in Leukocytes</p>The effect of compounds of the invention on intracellular cAMP was investigated using human neutrophils or guinea pig eosinophils. Human neutrophils were separated from peripheral blood, incubated with dihydrocytochaiasin B and the test compound for 10 min and then stimulated with FMLP. Guinea pig eosinophils were harvested by peritoneal lavage of animals previously treated with intra-peritoneal injections of human serum. Eosinophils were separated from the peritoneal exudate and incubated with isoprenaline and test compound.</p>With both cell types, suspensions were centrifuged at the end of the incubation, the cell pellets were resuspended in buffer and boiled for 10 min prior to measurement of cAMP by specific radioimmunoassay (DuPont).</p>The most potent compounds according to the invention induced a concentration -dependent elevation of cAMP in neutrophils and/or eosinophils at concentrations in the range 1nM to 1\u03bcM. \n\n3. Suppression of Leukocyte Function</p>Compounds of the invention were investigated for their effects on superoxide generation and chemotaxis of human neutrophils. Neutrophils were separated from peripheral blood, incubated with dihydrocytochalasin B for superoxide generation only and test compound prior to stimulation with FMLP. The most potent compounds caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of superoxide generation and chemotaxis at concentrations in the range"
