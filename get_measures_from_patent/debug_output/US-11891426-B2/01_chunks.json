In some embodiments, administration may be intratumoral or peritumoral. In some embodiments, administration may involve intermittent dosing. In some embodiments, administration may involve continuous dosing (e.g., perfusion) for at least a selected period of time.</p>Adoptive cell therapy: As used herein, \u201cadoptive cell therapy\u201d or \u201cACT\u201d involves the transfer of immune cells with antitumour activity into cancer patients. In some embodiments, ACT is a treatment approach that involves the use of lymphocytes with antitumour activity, the in vitro expansion of these cells to large numbers and their infusion into a cancer-bearing host.</p>Affinity: As used herein, the term \u201caffinity\u201d refers to the characteristics of a binding interaction between an antigen binding moiety (e.g., an antibody described herein) and an antigen target (e.g., CLL-1) and that indicates the strength of the binding interaction. In some embodiments, the measure of affinity is expressed as a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>). In some embodiments, an antigen binding moiety has a high affinity for an antigen target (e.g., a K<sub>D </sub>of less than about 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, less than about 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, or less than about 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>M).</p>Amelioration: As used herein, \u201camelioration\u201d refers to prevention, reduction and/or palliation of a state, or improvement of the state of a subject. Amelioration includes, but does not require, complete recovery or complete prevention of a disease, disorder or condition.</p>Amino acid: As used herein, term \u201camino acid,\u201d in its broadest sense, refers to any compound and/or substance that can be incorporated into a polypeptide chain. In some embodiments, an amino acid has the general structure H<sub>2</sub>N\u2014C(H)(R)\u2014COOH. In some embodiments, an amino acid is a naturally occurring amino acid. In some embodiments, an amino acid is a synthetic amino acid; in some embodiments, an amino acid is a d-amino acid; in some embodiments, an amino acid is an 1-amino acid. \u201cStandard amino acid\u201d refers to any of the twenty standard 1-amino acids commonly found in naturally occurring peptides. \u201cNonstandard amino acid\u201d refers to any amino acid, other than the standard amino acids, regardless of whether it is prepared synthetically or obtained from a natural source. As used herein, \u201csynthetic amino acid\u201d encompasses chemically modified amino acids, including but not limited to salts, amino acid derivatives (such as amides), and/or substitutions. Amino acids, including carboxy- and/or amino-terminal amino acids in peptides, can be modified by methylation, amidation, acetylation, protecting groups, and/or substitution with other chemical groups that can change the peptide's circulating half-life without adversely affecting their activity. Amino acids may participate in a disulfide bond. Amino acids may comprise one or posttranslational modifications, such as association with one or more chemical entities (e.g., methyl groups, acetate groups, acetyl groups, phosphate groups, formyl moieties, isoprenoid groups, sulfate groups, polyethylene glycol moieties, lipid moieties, carbohydrate moieties, biotin moieties, etc.). The term \u201camino acid\u201d is used interchangeably with \u201camino acid residue,\u201d and may refer to a free amino acid and/or to an amino acid residue of a peptide. It will be apparent from the context in which the term is used whether it refers to a free amino acid or a residue of a peptide.</p>Antibody: As used herein, the term \u201cantibody\u201d refers to a polypeptide that includes canonical immunoglobulin sequence elements sufficient to confer specific binding to a particular target antigen. As is known in the art, intact antibodies as produced in nature are approximately 150 kD tetrameric agents comprised of two identical heavy chain polypeptides (about 50 kD each) and two identical light chain polypeptides (about 25 kD each) that associate with each other into what is commonly referred to as a \u201cY-shaped\u201d structure. Each heavy chain is comprised of at least four domains (each about 110 amino acids long)\u2014an amino-terminal variable (VH) domain (located at the tips of the Y structure), followed by three constant domains: CH1, CH2, and the carboxy-terminal CH3 (located at the base of the Y's stem). A short region, known as the \u201cswitch\u201d, connects the heavy chain variable and constant regions. The \u201chinge\u201d connects CH2 and CH3 domains to the rest of the antibody. Two disulfide bonds in this hinge region connect the two heavy chain polypeptides to one another in an intact antibody. Each light chain is comprised of two domains\u2014an amino-terminal variable (VL) domain, followed by a carboxy-terminal constant (CL) domain, separated from one another by another \u201cswitch\u201d. Intact antibody tetramers are composed of two heavy chain-light chain dimers in which the heavy and light chains are linked to one another by a single disulfide bond; two other disulfide bonds connect the heavy chain hinge regions to one another, so that the dimers are connected to one another and the tetramer is formed. Naturally-produced antibodies are also glycosylated, typically on the CH2 domain. Each domain in a natural antibody has a structure characterized by an \u201cimmunoglobulin fold\u201d formed from two beta sheets (e.g., 3-, 4-, or 5-stranded sheets) packed against each other in a compressed antiparallel beta barrel.

In some embodiments, the general structure or sequence of an immunoglobulin variable domain can be indicated as follows: FR1-CDR1-FR2-CDR2-FR3-CDR3-FR4.</p>Improve, increase, or reduce: As used herein, the terms \u201cimprove,\u201d \u201cincrease\u201d or \u201creduce,\u201d or grammatical equivalents, indicate values that are relative to a baseline measurement, such as a measurement in the same individual prior to initiation of the treatment described herein, or a measurement in a control individual (or multiple control individuals) in the absence of the treatment described herein.</p>Individual, subject, patient: As used herein, the terms \u201csubject,\u201d \u201cindividual\u201d or \u201cpatient\u201d refer to a human or a non-human mammalian subject. The individual (also referred to as \u201cpatient\u201d or \u201csubject\u201d) being treated is an individual (fetus, infant, child, adolescent, or adult) suffering from a disease, for example, cancer. In some embodiments, the subject is a human.</p>K<sub>a</sub>: As used herein, \u201cK<sub>a</sub>\u201d refers to an association rate of a particular antigen binding moiety and an antigen target to form an antigen binding moiety/antigen target complex.</p>K<sub>d</sub>: As used herein, \u201cK<sub>d</sub>\u201d refers to a dissociation rate of a particular antigen binding moiety/antigen target complex.</p>K<sub>D</sub>: As used herein, \u201cK<sub>D</sub>\u201d refers to a dissociation constant, which is obtained from the ratio of K<sub>d </sub>to K<sub>a </sub>(i.e., K<sub>d</sub>/K<sub>a</sub>) and is expressed as a molar concentration (M). K<sub>D </sub>values can be determined using methods well established in the art, e.g., by using surface plasmon resonance, or using a biosensor system such as a Biacore\u00ae system.</p>Linker: As used herein, the term \u201clinker\u201d refers to, e.g., in a fusion protein, an amino acid sequence of an appropriate length other than that appearing at a particular position in the natural protein and is generally designed to be flexible and/or to interpose a structure, such as an a-helix, between two protein moieties. In general, a linker allows two or more domains of a fusion protein to retain 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or more of the biological activity of each of the domains. A linker may also be referred to as a spacer. In some embodiments, a polypeptide linker is at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100 or more amino acids in length.

    "resent on myeloid leukemic cells, along with mutant CD19, in various configurations.</p>The binding properties of an antibody described herein to an antigen (e.g., CLL-1) can be measured by methods known in the art, e.g., one of the following methods: BIACORE analysis, Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), x-ray crystallography, sequence analysis and scanning mutagenesis. The binding interaction of an antibody and an antigen (e.g., CLL-1) can be analyzed using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). SPR or Biomolecular Interaction Analysis (BIA) detects bio-specific interactions in real time, without labeling any of the interactants. Changes in the mass at the binding surface (indicative of a binding event) of the BIA chip result in alterations of the refractive index of light near the surface. The changes in the refractivity generate a detectable signal, which are measured as an indication of real-time reactions between biological molecules. Methods for using SPR are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,640; Raether (1988) Surface Plasmons Springer Verlag; Sjolander and Urbaniczky (1991) Anal. Chem. 63:2338-2345; Szabo et al. (1995) Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 5:699-705 and on-line resources provide by BIAcore International AB (Uppsala, Sweden). Additionally, a KinExA\u00ae (Kinetic Exclusion Assay) assay, available from Sapidyne Instruments (Boise, Id.) can also be used.</p>Information from SPR can be used to provide an accurate and quantitative measure of the equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>), and kinetic parameters, including K<sub>on </sub>and K<sub>off</sub>, for the binding of an antibody to an antigen (e.g., CLL-1). Such data can be used to compare different molecules. Information from SPR can also be used to develop structure-activity relationships (SAR). Variant amino acids at given positions can be identified that correlate with particular binding parameters, e.g., high affinity.</p>In certain embodiments, an antibody described herein exhibits high affinity for binding an antigen (e.g., CLL-1). In various embodiments, K<sub>D </sub>of an antibody as described herein for an antigen (e.g., CLL-1) is less than about 10<sup>\u22124</sup>, 10<sup>\u22125</sup>, 10<sup>\u22126</sup>, 10<sup>\u22127</sup>, 10<sup>\u22128</sup>, 10<sup>\u22129</sup>, 10<sup>\u221210</sup>, 10<sup>\u221211</sup>, 10<sup>\u221212</sup>, 10<sup>\u221213</sup>, 10<sup>\u221214</sup>, or 10<sup>\u221215</sup>M. In certain instances, K<sub>D </sub>of an antibody as described herein for an antigen (e.g., CLL-1) is between 0.001 and 1 nM, e.g., 0.001 nM, 0.005 nM, 0.01 nM, 0.05 nM, 0.1 nM, 0.5 nM, or 1 nM.</p>Scaffold Polypeptides</p>In some embodiments, the disclosure provides fusion proteins including a CD19 variant described herein and a scaffold polypeptide (or fragment thereof). A scaffold polypeptide (or fragment) can be selected to bind, e.g., to a tumor antigen (e.g., a tumor antigen described herein).

    "sed whether a fusion protein that includes a mutant CD19 on the light chain of an antibody could produce a functional mAb-CD19 fusion protein. This concept was tested in the context of two fusion proteins. For a first fusion protein, a mutant CD19 was fused C-terminally to the light chain of the Trastuzumab antibody (light chain-CD19 fusion: construct #375, SEQ ID NO. 20; heavy chain: construct #376, SEQ ID NO. 21). For a second fusion protein, a mutant CD19 was fused C-terminally to the light chain of the Rituximab rituximab antibody (light chain-CD19 fusion: construct #377, SEQ ID NO. 22; heavy chain: construct #378, SEQ ID NO. 23).</p>The trastuzumab-CD19 construct (#375/376) was readily secreted from transfected cells, bound potently to Her2 positive SKOV3 cells as detected in FACS by FMC63-PE and anti-human Fc-FITC (FIG. 27), and potently bridged killing of Her2 positive SKOV3 cells by CART 254 (a CAR19 T-cell) (FIG. 28). The wild type CD19-scFv/Her2 construct is provided for comparison. A construct lacking glyclosylation sites in the heavy chain of the Trastuzumab antibody, described below in Example 16 is also included in FIG. 28.</p>The Rituximab-CD19 construct (#377/378) was also readily secreted from transfected cells, bound potently to CD20 positive HEK293 cells (FIG. 29), and potently bridged killing of CD20 positive HEK293 cells (FIG. 30). The Leu16scFv-CD19 construct (construct #302, SEQ ID NO. 13) was included for comparison. The Leu16scFv-CD19 construct had a Kd of \u02dc3 nm whereas the Rituximab-based construct, i.e. the full Rituximab mAb, had a Kd of \u02dc16 pM.</p>Example 16Aglycosyl mAb-CD19 FusionsTrastuzumab-CD19 and Rituximab-CD19 constructs were generated in which the CD19 mutant was genetically fused to the C-terminus of the light chain, and a N297A mutation was made in the heavy chain to remove the single glycosylation site. An aglycosyl Trastuzumab-CD19 construct (light chain-CD19 fusion: construct #375, SEQ ID NO. 20; aglycosyl heavy chain: construct #393, SEQ ID NO. 24) demonstrated cell binding that was equivalent to that of a wild type Trastuzumab-CD19 construct (light chain-CD19 fusion: construct #375, SEQ ID NO. 20; heavy chain: construct #376, SEQ ID NO. 21) (FIG. 31). FIG. 28 demonstrates that the wild-type and aglycosyl Trastuzumab-CD19 construct have equivalent EC50s for killing. An aglycosyl Rituximab-CD19 construct (light chain-CD19 fusion: construct #377, SEQ ID NO. 22; aglycosyl heavy chain: construct #394, SEQ ID NO. 25) showed improved binding (\u02dc2 fold) relative to a wild type Rituximab-CD19 construct (light chain-CD19 fusion: construct #377, SEQ ID NO. 22; heavy chain: construct #378, SEQ ID NO. 23) (FIG. 32). The observed increase in binding translated to an increase in cell killing by the aglycosyl rituximab-CD19 construct relative to the wild-type construct (FIG. 33).</p>Example 17Fusion Proteins with Various CD19 TruncationsCertain CD19 constructs, e.g., construct #42, included a slightly truncated CD19 ECD, with the final 11 amino-acids removed (referred to herein as \u201cD1+D2\u201d or \u201cD1+2\u201d).

    "tent than N terminal fusions. Dose killing curves were performed for four C terminal constructs (#s 327, 337, 338, and 330) and one N-terminal construct (#321). Briefly, 1\u00d710<sup>4 </sup>U937 cells were incubated in wells of a round bottom 96 well plate in RPMI medium. Constructs were titrated from 1 \u03bcg/mL to 1 ng/mL, 25 \u03bcL per well. CAR-T254 cells (a CAR19 T-cell) were added at a ratio of 1:10 to U937 cells. After 48 hours, cells were spun, lysed, and luciferase levels were measured. As shown in FIG. 44, maximum U937 cell killing was achieved with all constructs. EC50s were generated, as shown in FIG. 45.</p>In addition, bispecific constructs were generated and assayed. The bispecific constructs included an anti-CLEC12a scFv described in Wiersma et al., MAbs 7:321-30 (2015). Construct #186 included CD19 domains 1+2 and anti-CLL1 VH and VL domains (described by Wiersma et al.). A bispecific construct (construct #357) was generated that included the VH and VL domains of Construct #186, an anti-CLEC12a VHH (clone 2H3), and CD19 mutant #2. These constructs were assayed for binding to U937 cells. Briefly, U937 cells (5\u00d710<sup>4</sup>) were Fc blocked, spun, pelleted, 100 \u03bcL of 3\u00d7 serial dilutions of fusion proteins (starting at 7.5 \u03bcg/mL) were added, incubated 30 minutes at 4 C, spun, washed twice, to the pellets was added anti-FMC63-PE and incubated for 30 minutes at 4 C. Cells were then spun, washed twice, fixed, and analyzed by FACS. As shown in FIGS. 46A and 46B, the binding EC50 of construct #357 was less than construct #330 (control), which was less then EC50 of construct #186. These constructs were also assayed for their ability to mediate killing of CLEC12a-expressing U937 cells by CAR-T254 cells. Briefly, 1\u00d710<sup>4 </sup>U937 cells were incubated in wells of a round bottom 96 well plate in RPMI medium. 1\u00d710<sup>5 </sup>CAR-T254 cells were added at a ratio of 1:10 to U937 cells. 100 \u03bcL of 3\u00d7 serial dilutions of constructs (starting concentrations were 1 \u03bcg/mL as final) were used. After a 48 hour incubation, luciferase levels were measured. As shown in FIGS. 47A and 47B, the killing EC50 of construct #357 was much less than construct #186 or #330.</p>Finally, a lentiviral vector (construct #221) was generated that encoded (i) CD19 CAR and (ii) construct #186. Such lentiviral vector was used to produce CAR T cells expressing CD19 CAR and secreting the fusion protein of construct #186. Such T cells are referred to as \u201cCAR221\u201d cells. Construct #142, 173, and 174 were also generated as controls. As shown in FIG. 48, expression of construct #221 from activated CAR221 cells was low. (Note that \u201cLG142\u201d, \u201cLG221\u201d, \u201cLG173\u201d, and \u201cLG174\u201d are the same constructs #142, 221, 173, and 174, respectfully, but made by a vendor). FIG. 49 demonstrates killing of U937 and NALM6 cells by construct #221 and LG221.</p>Example 19CD19 EpitopesAmino acid positions that were identified (using the systematic mutagenesis library described above) that resulted in loss of FMC63 and 3B10 binding were mapped onto the structure of CD19 (Teplyakov et al., Proteins 86:495-500 (2018)). The epitopes of both mAbs overlap, and are distal from the N- and C-termini, which are close to the plasma membrane. While the FMC63 epitope is not linear, the 3B10 epitope aligns with a linear peptide sequence in CD19, which is consistent with the 3B10 epitope being temperature resistant (described in Example 2; FIG. 3). When this peptide was expressed via yeast display, mAb 3B10 bound well. Surprisingly, mAb 3B10 bound less well to the CD19 ECD expressed on yeast. See FIG. 50.</p>EQUIVALENTSThose skilled in t"
