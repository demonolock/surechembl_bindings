As used herein, a \u201cnucleic acid targeting moiety\u201d is a nucleic acid that binds selectively to a target. In some embodiments, a nucleic acid targeting moiety is a nucleic acid aptamer. An aptamer is typically a polynucleotide that binds to a specific target structure that is associated with a particular organ, tissue, cell, extracellular matrix component, and/or subcellular locale. In general, the targeting function of the aptamer is based on the three-dimensional structure of the aptamer. In some embodiments, binding of an aptamer to a target is typically mediated by the inte",
    "or surface of a vaccine nanocarrier; they may both be encapsulated within the vaccine nanocarrier; etc.). One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the preceding examples are only representative of the many different ways in which multiple immunostimulatory agents may be associated with different locales of vaccine nanocarriers. Multiple immunostimulatory agents may be located at any combination of locales of vaccine nanocarriers.</p>In certain embodiments, immunostimulatory agents may be interleukins, interferon, cytokines, etc. In specific embodiments, an immunostimulatory agent may be a natural or synthetic agonist for a Toll-like receptor (TLR). In specific embodiments, vaccine nanocarriers incorporate a ligand for toll-like receptor (TLR)-7, such, as CpGs, which induce type I interferon production. In specific embodiments, an immunostimulatory agent may be an agonist for the DC surface molecule CD40. In certain embodiments, to stimulate immunity rather than tolerance, a nanocarrier incorporates an immunostimulatory agent that promotes DC maturation (needed for priming of naive T cells) and the production of cytokines, such as type I interferons, which promote antibody responses and anti-viral immunity. In some embodiments, an immunomodulatory agent may be a TLR-4 agonist, such as bacterial lipopolysacharide (LPS), VSV-G, and/or HMGB-1. In some embodiments, immunomodulatory agents are cytokines, which are small proteins or biological factors (in the range of 5 kD-20 kD) that are released by cells and have specific effects on cell-cell interaction, communication and behavior of other cells. In some embodiments, immunostimulatory agents may be proinflammatory stimuli released from necrotic cells (e.g., urate crystals). In some embodiments, immunostimulatory agents may be activated components of the complement cascade (e.g., CD21, CD35, etc.). In some embodiments, immunostimulatory agents may be activated components of immune complexes. The immunostimulatory agents include TLR-1, TLR-2, TLR-3, TLR-4, TLR-5, TLR-6, TLR-7, TLR-8, TLR-9, and TLR-10 agonists. The immunostimulatory agents also include complement receptor agonists, such as a molecule that binds to CD21 or CD35. In some embodiments, the complement receptor agonist induces endogenous complement opsonization of the nanocarrier. Immunostimulatory agents also include cytokine receptor agonists, such as a cytokine. In some embodiments, the cytokine receptor agonist is a small molecule, antibody, fusion protein, or aptamer.</p>In some embodiments, there are more than one type of immunostimulatory agent. In some embodiments, the different immunostimulatory agents each act on a different pathway. The immunostimulatory agents, therefore, can be different Toll-like receptors, a Toll-like receptor and CD40, a Toll-like receptor and a component of the inflammasome, etc.</p>In some embodiments, the immunostimulatory agent may be an adjuvant.

Examples of markers include those provided elsewhere herein.</p>Follicular Dendritic Cells</p>B cells that initially detect a previously unknown antigen typically express a BA cell receptor (BCR, i.e, an antibody with a transmembrane domain) with suboptimal binding affinity for that antigen. However, B cells can increase by several orders of magnitude the affinity of the antibodies they make when they enter into a germinal center (GC) reaction. This event, which typically lasts several weeks, depends on FDC that accumulate, retain and present antigenic material to the activated B cells. B cells, while proliferating vigorously, repeatedly mutate the genomic sequences that encode the antigen binding site of their antibody and undergo class-switch recombination to form secreted high-affinity antibodies, mostly of the IgG isotype. GC reactions also stimulate the generation of long-lived memory B cells and plasma cells that maintain high protective antibody titers, often for many years.

In some embodiments, inventive vaccine nanocarriers are administered parenterally. In some embodiments, inventive vaccine nanocarriers are administered intravenously. In some embodiments, inventive vaccine nanocarriers are administered orally.</p>In general the most appropriate route of administration will depend upon a variety of factors including the nature of the vaccine nanocarrier (e.g., its stability in the environment of the gastrointestinal tract), the condition of the subject (e.g., whether the subject is able to tolerate oral administration), etc. The invention encompasses the delivery of the inventive pharmaceutical composition by any appropriate route taking into consideration likely advances in the sciences of drug delivery.</p>In certain embodiments, the vaccine nanocarriers of the invention may be administered in amounts ranging from about 0.001 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg, from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kd, from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 40 mg/kg, from about 0.5 mg/kg to about 30 mg/kg, from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg, from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg, or from about 1 mg/kg to about 25 mg/kg, of subject body weight per day, one or more times a day, to obtain the desired therapeutic effect.

In some embodiments, different vaccine nanocarriers within a population of vaccine nanocarriers comprise different targeting moieties, and all of the different targeting moieties can bind to the same target.

This is evidenced by the fact that, upon immunization with PLA-PEG-nicotine synthetic nanocarriers that incorporated both R848 and OVA, anti-nicotine IgG titers were enhanced by \u02dc10-fold in mice that had received naive OT-II (i.e. OVA-specific) T helper cells compared to mice that did not receive OT-II cells. This effect indicates that the adjuvant (R848) and T cell antigen (OVA) contained within the immunofeature-modified synthetic nanocarriers were efficiently targeted to DCs that presented OVA to T cells. The greater availability of OVA-specific T cells in animals that had received OT-II cells resulted in an enhanced helper response that, in turn, boosted the production of anti-nicotine antibodies by B cells. Thus, a moiety that can form an immunofeature surface according to the above criteria can boost synthetic nanocarrier immunogenicity even when its binding affinity to APC is too low to be detectable by in vitro capture assays.</p>Example 16Prophetic Nanocarrier Formulation\u2014HPV16L2 17-36 PeptidePLA-PEG-OCH3 (or PLA-PEG-COOH) polymer is prepared using HO-PEG-OCH3 (or HO-PEG-COOH, Aldrich Chemical, approximately MW of PEG=2 KD) which is used to initiate a ring opening polymerization of D,L-lactide (final polymer MW target=18-20 KD).

Fluorescent nanoparticles (\u02dc100 nm) were generated using a double-emulsion procedure. Nicotine particles consisted of 50% PLA-PEG-Nic (\u02dc15 kD PLA), 15% PLGA-Dye-PLGA (\u02dc15 kD PLGA total), and 35% PLA (\u02dc15 kD), whereas control particles were generated using 50% PLA-PEG (\u02dc15 kD PLA, methoxy terminated PEG), 15% PLGA-Dye-PLGA (\u02dc15 kD PLGA total) and 35% PLA (\u02dc15 kD). To assess targeting to DC, two sets of control particles were generated, with and without encapsulated OVA protein (OVA). All sets of particles were produced to incorporate PLGA-Rhodamine-B (=PLGA-Dye) as a green (543 nm) fluorescent label. Additionally, control particles (without OVA) were also produced to incorporate Alexa 647, which has a spectrally distinct (red) fluorescence emission. All green particles were mixed with an equal amount of red control particles and the mixtures were injected into footpads of young adult C57/BL6 mice. The draining popliteal lymph node was harvested 4 h or 24 h later, fixed overnight at 4\u00b0 C. with phosphate buffered L-lysine with 1% paraformaldehyde/periodate, cryoprotected by an ascending series of 10%, 20% and 30% sucrose in PBS, snap-frozen in tissue freezing medium (Triangle Biomedical Sciences, Durham, N.C.) and prepared for immunofluorescence analysis of frozen sections.
