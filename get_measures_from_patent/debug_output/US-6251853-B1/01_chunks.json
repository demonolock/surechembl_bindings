    " Examples serve to illustrate the invention further. Experimental part</p>1. Functional Results on G Protein Activation in Essential Hypertension</p>A detailed characterization was carried out of the activation of G proteins from cells of normotensive subjects and hypertensive patients. For this purpose, the stimulated incorporation of radiolabeled [<sup>35</sup>S] GTP\u03b3S was quantified by the method described by Wieland et al. (Wieland, T., Liedel, K., Xaldenberg-Stasch, S., Meyer zu Heringdorf, D., Schmidt, M., and Jakobs, K. E. Analysis of receptor-G protein interactions in permeabilized cells. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch.Pharmacol. 351:329-336, 1995). G Proteins were activated initially by stimulating cells which had been permeabilized with digitonin using the peptide mastoparan 7. This peptide simulates the configuration of an activated G protein-coupled receptor so that it can be used to induce direct G protein activation independent of receptors (Ross, E. M. and Higashijima, T. Regulation of G protein activation by mastoparan and other cationic peptides. Methods Enzymol. 237:27-38, 1994). The binding of GTP\u03b3S induced by MAS-7 is completely PTX-sensitive so that it can be used to quantify the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins of the Gi type. FIG. 2 shows the concentration-dependence of the G protein activation induced by mastiparan 7 (MAS-7) in the normotensive (NT) and hypertensive (HT) state. MAS-7 induces strong [<sup>35</sup>S] GTP\u03b3S binding on HT cells with an EC50 of about 5 \u03bcm (FIG. 2). Maximum binding is reached at about 25 to 50 \u03bcm MAS-7. In contrast to this, the concentration required for the same [<sup>35</sup>S] GTP\u03b3S binding to NT cells are [sic] 10 times higher (FIG. 2). These data demonstrate that activation of PTX-sensitive G proteins in HT cells requires distinctly less activated receptor than that in NT cells.</p>FIG. 3 shows the time course of the binding, stimulated by mastoparan 7, of [<sup>35</sup>S] GTP\u03b3S to cell lines from normotensives (NT) and hypertensives (HT).</p>The binding of [<sup>35</sup>S] GTP\u03b3S to hypertensive cells is distinctly speeded up (rate constants 0.005 s<sup>\u22121 </sup>in the normotensive versus 0.01 s<sup>\u22121 </sup>in the hypertensive state).</p>FIG. 4 shows the GDP-dependence of binding, stimulated by mastoparan 7, of [<sup>35</sup>S] GTP\u03b3S to isolated cell membranes from normotensives and hypertensives. It is evident that the maximum stimulated binding of [<sup>35</sup>S] GTP\u03b3S to membranes from hypertensives occurs at lower concentrations of GDP (about 0.2 \u03bcmol/l), where a concentration of 1 \u03bcmol/l GDP is required for the same effect in normotensives.</p>In a similar way, the maximum binding, stimulated by mastoparan 7, of [<sup>35</sup>S] GTP\u03b3S to membrane preparations from hypertensive cells a low concentration of free Mg<sup>2+ </sup>(about 0.01 mmol/l), while a free Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration of 0.1 mmol/l is necessary for the same maximum binding of [<sup>35</sup>S] GTP\u03b3S to membrane"
