    "he binding protein from solution indicates that the binding protein has become unstable. To assess physical stability, solutions comprising a binding protein according to the present disclosure or 4G7 can be incubated at 4\u00b0 C. and assessed visually for precipitation at two weeks, four weeks, 12 weeks, six months and 12 months.</p>In another example, the binding protein has reduced immunogenicity in a human subject compared to 4G7. For example, a binding protein can have reduced immunogenicity compared to 4G7 when immunogenicity is measure via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In another example, a binding protein can have reduced immunogenicity compared to 4G7 when immunogenicity is measure via Surface Plasmon Resonance.</p>In another example, the binding protein has higher specificity for LMA than 4G7.</p>In another example, the binding protein has lower cross-reactivity (i.e. the ability of a binding protein to react with similar antigenic sites on different proteins) compared to 4G7. In this example, cross-reactivity of binding proteins can be measured using various methods. In an example, cross-reactivity is assessed via ELISA.</p>In another example, the binding protein has higher binding affinity for LMA than 4G7.</p>In another example, the binding protein has a higher binding affinity for LMA relative to light chain than 4G7.</p>In the above referenced examples, the affinity of a binding protein for LMA can be measured using various methods. In an example, the dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) or association constant (K<sub>A</sub>) or equilibrium constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of a binding protein for LMA is determined. These constants for a binding protein are, in one example, measured by a radiolabelled or fluorescently-labelled LMA-binding assay. This assay equilibrates the binding protein with a minimal concentration of labelled LMA in the presence of a titration series of unlabelled LMA. Following washing to remove unbound LMA, the amount of label is determined.</p>Affinity measurements can be determined by standard methodology for antibody reactions, for example, immunoassays, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (Rich and Myszka Curr. Opin. Biotechnol 11:54, 2000; Englebienne Analyst. 123: 1599, 1998), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) or other kinetic interaction assays known in the art.</p>In one example, the constants are measured by using surface plasmon resonance assays, e.g., using BIAcore surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) with immobilized LMA. Exemplary SPR methods are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,229,619.</p>In the other examples, the affinity of a binding protein for LMA can be measured using Isothermal Titration Microcalorimetry.</p>Binding Protein Production</p>Recombinant Expression</p>In one example, a binding protein as described herein is a peptide or polypeptide (e.g., is an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof). In one example, the binding protein is recombinant.</p>In the case of a recombinant peptide or polypeptide, nucleic acid encoding same can be cloned into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells, such as E. coli cells, yeast cells, insect cells, or mammalian cells, such as simian COS cells, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) c"
