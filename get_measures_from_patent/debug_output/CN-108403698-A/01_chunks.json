    "her non-sterilizations anti-grape\nCoccus reagent.These compounds can also be used to treatment and be infected caused by staphylococcus aureus and/or staphylococcus epidermis,\nBecause they inhibit the gene expression of a variety of important virulence factors.</p>Confirm that streptokinase (SK) is the file of the important virulence factor of A group streptococcus (GAS) infection based on previous, using anti-\nToxicity method can inhibit the small molecule of the SK expression with hypotoxicity to GAS to screen.Assessment is in the feelings for not hindering bacterial growth\nIt can inhibit a variety of small molecules of SK expression under condition.In addition, these compounds can inhibit broad range of streptococcus virulence factor\nGene expression (Figure 1A).A kind of compound (CCG-2979) can protect mouse to infect (Figure 1B) from A group streptococcus.</p>Then it is formed about Staphylococcus Biofilm and tests these compounds.Test is to golden yellow Portugal in microtiter plates\nIn 68 kinds of analogs of the effect of grape coccus Newman biofilm formations, the two confirms that inhibiting effect is consistent, no notable bacterium suppression\nSystem growth.Both compounds (CCG-203592 and CCG-205363) are tested on staphylococcus aureus strains RN6390,\nThis bacterial strain than Newman bacterial strain it is reported that be more likely to form biomembrane.Two kinds of compounds all confirm strong in microtiter plates\nInhibit RN6390 biofilm formations (for CCG-203592 IC50=2.42 \u00b1 0.14 \u03bcM, for CCG-205363\nIC50=6.96 \u00b1 0.76 \u03bcM) (Fig. 2A and B), do not inhibit bacterial growth at 20 \u03bcM.The knot of these inhibitor is shown in Fig. 4\nStructure.</p>CCG-203592 is treated by real-time RT-PCR one group of Staphylococcus aureus toxic factor gene of test anti-\nIt answers.Several virulence factor genes lower (Fig. 2 C) by CCG-203592, including to Staphylococcus Aureus Biofilm formation and structure\nBuild important gene (atl and psm).A kind of a-protein (SPA) as important virulence factor is also suppressed, and shows smallization\nClose potential of the object as antitoxin reagent.CCG-203592 shows that it also may be used to the extensive influence that staphylococcus aureus gene is expressed\nTo protect host from infection of staphylococcus aureus, this protects mouse by it in staphylococcus aureus Rat model of pulmonary infection\nIn vivo efficacy and supported (Fig. 2 D).A kind of analog (CCG-203043) from same chemical series is not inhibiting thin\nIn the case that bacterium grows, shows and (Fig. 2 E) is acted on to the strong inhibition of staphylococcus epidermis biofilm formation.</p>CCG-203592 also makes the biofilm formation in Medical Devices on widely used silica gel piece surface reduce (figure\n3)\u3002</p>Several compounds from CCG-2979 series can inhibit staphylococcus aureus or staphylococcus epidermis biomembrane\nIt is formed, while also inhibiting A group streptococcus SK gene expressions.</p>Structure-activity relationship (SAR) is carried out on 200 to 300 kinds of new analogs"
