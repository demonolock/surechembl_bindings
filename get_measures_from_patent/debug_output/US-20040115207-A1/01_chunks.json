    " invention. Minibodies are sFv polypeptide chains which include oligomerization domains at their C-termini, separated from the sFv by a hinge region. Pack et al, (1992), Biochem, 31:1579-1584. The oligomerization domain comprises self-associating \u03b1-helices, e.g., leucine zippers, that can be further stabilized by additional disulfide bonds. The oligomerization domain is designed to be compatible with vectorial folding across a membrane, a process thought to facilitate in vivo folding of the polypeptide into a functional binding protein. </p>[0162] Generally, minibodies are produced using recombinant methods well known in the art. See, e.g., Pack et al, (1992), Biochem, 31:1579-1584; Cumber et al., 1992, J. Immunology, 149B:120-126; and International application Nos. PCT/US92/07986, published Apr. 1, 1993, and PCT/US92/10140, published Jun. 10, 1993, as well as examples 6 and 8, below. For example, International application PCT/US92/07986 describes methods for making bifunctional F(ab\u2032)<sub>2 </sub>molecules composed of two F(ab\u2032) monomers linked through cysteine amino acids located at the C-terminus of the first constant domain of each heavy chain. International application PCT/US92/10140 also discloses bifunctional F(ab\u2032)<sub>2 </sub>dimers which, in addition to the cysteine residues located in the hinge region, also contain C-terminal leucine zipper domains that further stabilize the F(ab\u2032)<sub>2 </sub>dimers. In both cases, the resulting F(ab\u2032)<sub>2 </sub>dimers are \u2267100 kD in size, and thus smaller than intact immunoglobulins. The generation of (FvCys)<sub>2 </sub>heterodimers by chemically crosslinking two V<sub>H</sub>.CYS domains together is described by Cumber et al., 1992, J. Immunology, 149B:120-126. </p>[0163] Chimeric antibody molecules will also find use with the present invention. A chimeric antibody can include antigen-binding sites, such as variable regions, or fragments of variable regions, derived from a non-human immunoglobulin, which retain specificity for the cell-surface receptor or antigen in question. The remainder of the antibody can be derived from the species in which the antibody will be used. Thus, if the antibody is to be used in a human, the antibody can be \u201chumanized\u201d in order to reduce immunogenicity yet retain activity. Such chimeric antibodies may contain not only combining sites for the cell-surface receptor or antigen of interest, but also binding sites for other proteins. In this way, bifunctional reagents can be generated with targeted specificity to, e.g., both external and internal antigens. For a description of chimeric antibodies and methods of generating the same, see, e.g., Winter et al. (1991) Nature 349:293-299; Lobuglio et al. (1989) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 86:4220-4224; Shaw et al. (1987) J. Immunol. 138:4534-4538; and Brown et al. (1987) Cancer Res. 47:3577-3583) (each describing chimeric antibodies comprising rodent V regions and associated CDRs fused to human constant domains); Jones et al. (",
    ", and a 3-5 fold decrease was observed at 14.5 h. A 2-fold increase in kidney at 1 h (presumably due to renal clearance of the radioactive moiety) followed by a decrease was observed. These results demonstrate effective in vivo cleavage of the \u03b2-lactamase-sensitive linker moiety within the bioconjugate, with rapid removal of the radioisotope by the kidney and a decrease of radioisotope content in the blood, liver, lung and marrow. </p>Example 11 [0237] In vivo Metabolism and Biodistribution of Bioconjugates </p>[0238] Bioconjugates comprising anti-CD20 antibody were evaluated to determine in vivo sensitivity to pegylated \u03b2-lactamase as described above. Pegylated-\u03b2-lactamase was tested to determine cleavage of the bioconjugate and retention of the radioisotope at the tumor site, and to decrease the extravascular concentration of the enzyme. </p>[0239] Pegylated-\u03b2-lactamase has a M.W. of about 160,000 compared to a M.W. of about 40,000 for the native enzyme. \u03b2-lactamase was pegylated with methoxy-PEG-succinimidyl proprionate (M.W. 5000) using standard methods. The enzymatic activity was verified by reaction with nitrocefin (chromogenic cephalosporin substrate), and the molecular weight was assessed by non-reducing SDS PAGE (Zalipsky S. et al., Chem Commun, 653-654, 1999). Higher molecular weight forms of pegylated enzyme were synthesized (Topchieva I. N., Polymer Sci. (USSR), 32:833-851, 1990). </p>[0240] Pegylated \u03b2-lactamase retained 78% enzymatic reactivity, migrated at 160 Kd, and cleaved the bioconjugate containing anti-CD20 antibody, in vivo, similar to the native enzyme. Biodistribution studies evaluating pegylated enzyme versus native enzyme, in tumor bearing mice are performed as described below. </p>[0241] A bioconjugate containing an anti-CD20 antibody labeled with 18 \u03bcCi I-131 (25 \u03bcg) was administered to immunodeficient mice with subcutaneous Ramos B lymphoma cell tumors. Test antibody (400 \u03bcg) was also administered to the mice, to decrease nonspecific binding activity. After 20 h, the mice were treated (iv.) with pegylated-\u03b2-lactamase (6.4 \u03bcg). Mice (3-4 mice group) were sacrificed at 1 h and 4 h post \u03b2-lactamase treatment, and organ and tumor samples were collected and weighed. The radioactivity was determined by gamma counting, and percent injected dose per gram tissue (% ID/g) was calculated. The results were as tabulated in Table 1.  \nTABLE 1Concentration of radioactivity in normal tissues and tumor% ID/g (Ratio of tumor:normal tissue % ID/g)1 Hour4 HourPEG-\u03b2-PEG-\u03b2-lactamaseNo enzymelactamaseNo enzymeBlood5.1(1.3)*11.9(0.6)4.5(0.9)12.1(0.6)Marrow3.6(1.9)8.4(0.8)2.7(1.5)6.8(1.0)Lung2.0(3.5)3.7(1.9)1.6(2.5)3.3(2.2)Liver1.4(4.9)2.0(3.6)1.0(4.0)2.0(3.6)Kidney4.0(1.7)2.1(3.4)2.3(1.7)2.7(2.6)Tumor6.97.14.07.1\n</p>[0242] Evaluation of organ and tumor distribution demonstrated a greater than 2-fold decrease in blood and marrow radioisotope content at 1 h and 4 h post-pegylated \u03b2-lactamase infusion.

    "The in vivo half life of radioiodinated enzyme was ascertained to determine an appropriate schedule for multiple dose administration </p>[0258] The effect of pegylated enzyme on the reduction of undesirable cleavage at the tumor site was determined. Generally, a reduction of tumor penetration does not prevent loss of radioisotope from conjugates bound to the tumor cell surface. However, delaying entry of enzyme into the tumor, may permit a delay in local cleavage and, for internalizing antibody, allow greater time for internalization prior to cleavage. Additionally, pegylated enzyme formulations potentially have reduced immunogenicity (Zalipsky, S., Bioconjugate Chem., 6:150-165, 1995 and Dreborg S. and Akerblom E. B., Crit Rev Ther Drug Carrier Syst, 6:315-365, 1990). </p>[0259] The effect of pegylation of \u03b2-lactamase on the extent of penetration into the tumor site was determined by radioiodinating the enzyme and assessing the in vivo biodistribution of the radioisotope. The effect of native \u03b2-lactamase versus pegylated-enzyme on tumor residence time of a bioconjugate was determined. \u03b2-lactamase was pegylated by standard methods with methoxy-PEG-succinimidyl proprionate (M.W. 5000), enzymatic activity was verified by reaction with nitrocefin (chromogenic cephalosporin substrate), and the molecular weight was assessed by non-reducing SDS PAGE (Zalipsky S. et al., Chem Commun, 653-654, 1999). </p>[0260] Pegylated \u03b2-lactamase retained 78% enzymatic reactivity, migrated at 160 Kd, and cleaved the bioconjugate containing anti-CD20 antibody, in vivo, similar to the native enzyme. Biodistribution studies evaluating pegylated enzyme versus native enzyme, in tumor bearing mice were performed as described above. Higher molecular weight forms of pegylated enzyme were synthesized (Tropchieva I. N., Polymer Sci. (USSR), 32:833-851, 1990), and their effect on delay or prevention of entry into the extravascular space, and on isotope loss from the tumor due to cleavage was determined. </p>Example 16 [0261] Biodistribution of Bioconjugates in Non-Human Primates </p>[0262] The in vivo biodistribution of bioconjugates in nonhuman primates is determined as follows. The animals are administered (i) the bioconjugate and the \u03b2-lactamase (Group I, 3 animals), and (ii) bioconjugate (Group II, 3 animals), and the time-activity curves for lung, liver, and lymph nodes is evaluated. </p>[0263] Animals are administered bioconjugate trace-labeled with 2 mCi of 1-131 (1.7 mg/kg) and undergo serial quantitative gamma camera imaging at the end of infusion, immediately before and 30 min following \u03b2-lactamase infusion, and then daily for 2 days. To assess marrow and lymph node uptake, biopsies are performed immediately before, and 6 h and 24 h post infusion of \u03b2-lactamase. Microdistribution of antibody in lymph node tissue is determined by autoradiography (see Clark E. A. and Draves K. E., Eur J Immunol, 17:1799-1805, 1987). </p>[0264] The initial uptake and clearance of radionuc"
