    "al, Cancer Res. 55:5133-5139 (1995). Therefore, chromosomal abnormalities associated with cancer may be used as intermediate markers to detect premalignant lesions in a patient. Common chromosomal abnormalities associated with cancer include, but are not limited to, allelic deletions or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in tumor suppressor genes such as 3p (FHIT and others), 9p (9p21 for\n\n 17p {17pl3 for <sub>P</sub>53 gene and others) and I3q (13ql4 for retinoblastoma gene Rb and others). Deletions in 3p and 9p are associated with smoking and the early stages of lung cancer, Mao et al, J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 89:857-862 (1997). Deletions affecting 3p, 5q, 8p, 17p and 18q are common change in epithelial cancers. See generally Tsao et al, CA Clin. Cancer J. Clin. 54:153 (2004). Other chromosomal mutations associated with cancer include those which activate oncogenes. Oncogenes whose presence may be used as intermediate markers include, but are not limited to, Ras, c-myc, epidemral growth factor. erb-B2 and cyclins E, Dl and BL See generally id, at 154.</p>Other intermediate markers may be the products of genes up-regulated in premalignant cells and cancer cells. Genes that may be up-regulated in premalignant cells include, but are not limited to, eyelooxygenases COX-I and COX-2. telomerase. Other biomarkers of cancer cells, and some premalignant ceils, include, but are not limited to, p53, epidermal growth factor receptor (GFR). proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). RAS.

See generally id. at 155-157. Patients that have been cured of their initial cancers or have been definitively treated for their premalignant lesions are also at a higher risk to develop cancer than the general population. A second primary tumor refers to a new primary cancer in a person with a history of cancer. Second primary tumors are the leading cause of mortality in head and neck cancer. Id. at 150. A second primary tumor is distinct from a metastasis in that the former originates de novo while the later originates from an existing tumor. Patients that have been cured of cancer or premalignant lesions of the breast, head and neck, lung, and skin are at a particularly high risk to develop second primary tumors.</p>The compositions comprising a cupredoxin or variant, derivative or"
