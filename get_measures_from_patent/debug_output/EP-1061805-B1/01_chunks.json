    " these proteins (Cys<sub>2</sub>His<sub>2</sub> class) is -Cys-(X)<sub>2-4</sub>-Cys-(X)<sub>12</sub>-His-(X)<sub>3-5</sub>-His (where X is any amino acid). Studies have demonstrated that a single zinc finger of this class consists of an alpha helix containing the two invariant histidine residues co-ordinated with zinc along with the two cysteine residues of a single beta turn (see, e.g., Berg &amp; Shi, Science 271:1081-1085 (1996)).</p>A \"target site\" is the nucleic acid sequence recognized by a zinc finger protein. A single target site typically has about four to about ten or more base pairs. Typically, a two-fingered zinc finger protein recognizes a four to seven base pair target site, a three-fingered zinc finger protein recognizes a six to ten base pair target site, a six fingered zinc finger protein recognizes two adjacent nine to ten base pair target sites, and so on for proteins with more than six fingers. The target site is in any position that allows regulation of gene expression, e.g., adjacent to, up- or downstream of the transcription initiation site; proximal to an enhancer or other transcriptional regulation element such as a repressor (e.g., SP-1 binding sites, hypoxia response elements, nuclear receptor recognition elements, p53 binding sites, etc.), RNA polymerase pause sites; and intron/exon boundaries. The term \"adjacent target sites\" refers to non-overlapping target sites that are separated by zero to about 5 base pairs.</p>\"K<sub>d</sub>\" refers to the dissociation constant for the compound, i.e., the concentration of a compound (e.g., a zinc finger protein) that gives half maximal binding of the compound to its target (i.e., half of the compound molecules are bound to the target) under given conditions (i.e., when [target] &lt;&lt; K<sub>d</sub>), as measured using a given assay system (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,789,538). The assay system used to measure the K<sub>d</sub> should be chosen so that it gives the most accurate measure of the actual K<sub>d</sub> of the ZFP. Any assay system can be used, as long is it gives an accurate measurement of the actual K<sub>d</sub> of the ZFP. In one embodiment, the K<sub>d</sub> for the ZFPs of the invention is measured using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (\"EMSA\"), as described in Example I and on page 14 of the present specification. Unless an adjustment is made for ZFP purity or activity, the K<sub>d</sub> calculations made using the method of Example I may result in an underestimate of the true K<sub>d</sub> of a given ZFP. The K<sub>d</sub> of a ZFP used to modulate transcription of an endogenous cellular gene is less than about 25 nM.</p>An \"endogenous cellular gene\" refers to a gene that is native to a cell, which is in its normal genomic and chromatin context, and which is not heterologous to the cell. Such cellular genes include, e.g., animal genes, plant genes, bacterial genes, protozoal genes, fungal genes, mitrochondrial genes, and chloroplastic genes.</p>A \"n",
    " electrophoresis and the radioactivity was evaluated by autoradiography. 293 cells transfected with the VEGF1-VP16 had a 2-4 fold increase in the level of VEGF mRNA when compared to cells transfected with NVF-control (Figure 10, panel A; see Example VII for experimental details). The size of the protected probe was identical to the size of the probe generated from the control human RNA provided as a control for RNA integrity. (Figure 10, panel A).</p>In a separate experiment, the level of VEGF specific mRNA was also quantitated in cells that had been transfected with a VEGF-KRAB effector plasmid (Figure 10, panel B; see Example VI for experimental details). The details of the transfection are described in Example VI. A dramatic decrease in the level of VEGF mRNA was observed when cells were transfected with the VEGF3a/1-KRAB effector plasmid. No significant decrease in VEGF mRNA was observed when cells were transfected with NKF-control or a non-VEGF specific ZFP (CCR5-5-KRAB and CCR5-3-KRAB, which recognize different CCR5 target sites).</p>This experiment demonstrates that the increase in VEGF protein observed upon transfection with the VEGF1-VP16 chimeric transcription factor is mediated by an increase in the level of VEGF mRNA. Similarly, the decrease in VEGF protein observed upon transfection with the VEGF3a/1-KRAB chimeric transcription factor is mediated by a decrease in the level of VEGF mRNA.</p>Example IX: Activation of EPO, a developmentally silent geneEPO is a 30.4 kD glycoprotein hormone and plays a key role in the control of red blood cell production. The EPO gene is normally only expressed in fetal liver and the adult kidney in response to hypoxia. It acts through interacting with the EPO receptor on the erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow to stimulate their proliferation and differentiation into mature erythrocytes (Jelkmann, Physiological Reviews 72:449(1992); Semenza, Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America 8:863(1994); Ratcliffe et al., J. Exp. Bio.(1991)). Recombinant human EPO gene products have been successfully used to treat anemia and chronic renal failure (Egrie, Pharacotherapy 10:35(1990)).</p>The EPO2C ZFP was designed to recognize a 9-bp DNA-binding site located 853-bp upstream of the EPO transcription initiation site.</p>The EPO2C binding site sequence is GCGGTGGCT.</p>Eukaryotic expression vectors were constructed by fusing the sequence encoding EPO2C ZFP to the SV40 nuclear localization signal (NLS) and the HSV VP16 transactivation domain.</p>All plasmid DNAs were prepared using the Qiagen Midi preparation system. 2x10<sup>6</sup> Hep3B cells (a human hepatocellular carcinoma-derived cell line) or 5x10<sup>6</sup> HEK293 cells (a human embryonic kidney epithelium-derived cell line) were seeded into 6-well plates one day before transfection. 500 ng of the effector plasmid (encoding the engineered ZFP) was transiently transfected into the cells using Lipofectamin (GIBCO-BRL).
