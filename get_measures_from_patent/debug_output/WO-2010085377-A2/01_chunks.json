The hydroxamic acid moiety has been demonstrated as the key structural element in many highly potent and selective inhibitors against a variety of metalloenzymes, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 converting enzyme (TACE), Histone Deacetylase (HDAC), Peptidyl deformylase (PDF), A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase (ADAM), UDP-3-O-[R-3-hydroxymyristoyl]-GlcNAc deacetylase, Clostridium Histolytium Collagenase (ChC), Procollagen C-Proteinase (PCP), and Aggrecanase. Many of these metalloenzymes are well known important disease target, such as HDAC and MMP. All hydroxamic acid compounds exemplified in the application have been tested against one or multiple metalloenzymes. The following protocol is used to assay the compounds of the invention against the HDAC enzymes. The buffer used in this assay is 25 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and the subtrate is Boc-Lys(Ac)-AMC (Fluor-de-Lys substrate, Cat. # KI- 104) in a 50 mM stock solution in DMSO. The enzyme stock solution is 4 \u03bcg/mL in buffer. The compounds are pre-incubated (2 \u03bcl in DMSO diluted to 13 \u03bcl in buffer for transfer to assay plate) with enzyme (20 \u03bcl of 4 \u03bcg/ml) for 10 minutes at room temperature (35 \u03bcl pre -incubation volume). The mixture is pre-incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. The reaction is started by bringing the temperature to 37\u00b0C and adding 16 \u03bcl substrate. Total reaction volume is 50 \u03bcl. The reaction is stopped after 20 minutes by addition of 50 \u03bcl developer, prepared as directed by Biomol (Fluor-de-Lys developer, Cat. # KI- 105). A plate is incubated in the dark for 10 minutes at room temperature before reading (\u03bb<sub>E</sub>\u03c7=360nm, \u03bb<sub>Em</sub><sup>=</sup>470nm, Cutoff filter at 435nm). Such assays, carried out with a range of doses of test compounds, allow the determination of an approximate IC50 value. The HDAC inhibitor SAHA was used as reference compound. All compounds exemplified in the application show inhibitory activity against one or more of HDAC-I, HDAC-2, HDAC-3, HDAC-4, HDAC-5, HDAC-6, HDAC-7, HDAC-8, HD AC-9, HDAC- 10, and HDAC- 11. Although the inhibitory properties of the compounds of the present \n\n invention vary with structural change as expected, the activity generally exhibited by these agents is in the range of IC50 =1 - 1000 nM.</p>For example, the following is the structure of DNA alkylating drug Bendamustine and its corresponding hydroxamic acid derivative CY 190602. The following table lists the HDAC IC50 values of the hydroxamic acid derivative CY 190602.</p><img id=\"imgf000057_0001\" path=\"imgf000057_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/168586843/WO/20100729/A2/002010/08/53/77/imgf000057_0001.tif\"/></p>(b) In vitro anti-proliferation assay:</p>Cell antiproliferation was assayed by PerkinElmer ATPlite\u2122 Luminescence Assay System. The cancer cell lines were plated at 10k cells per well in Costar 96- well plates with different concentration of compounds for 72 hours with 5% FBS. After that, one lyophilized substrate solution vial was reconstituted by adding 5 mL of substrate buffer solution and was agitated gently until the solution is homogeneous. 50 \u03bcL of mammalian cell lysis solution was added to 100 \u03bcL of cell suspension per well of a microplate and the plate was shaken for five minutes in an orbital shaker at 700 rpm. This procedure will lyses the cells and stabilizes the ATP. Next, 50 \u03bcL substrate solution was added to the wells and microplate was shaken for five minutes in an orbital shaker at 700 rpm. Finally the luminescence was measured by a PerkinElmer TopCount\u00ae Microplate Scintillation Counter. Such assays, carried out with a range of doses of test compounds, allow the determination of an approximate IC50 value for the in vitro cell antiproliferation assay of cancer cell lines. Although the inhibitory properties of the \n\n compounds of the present invention vary with structural change as expected, the activity generally exhibited by these agents is in the range of IC50 =0.01-200 uM.</p>For example, the following table lists the IC50 values of the Bendamustien and its hydroxamic acid derivative CY 190602 in the cell anti-proliferative assays. The present inventors have surprisingly found that, in many cancer cell lines such as RPMI8226, MMlR, and MMlS, the anti-tumor activities of the hydroxamic acid derivative are significantly better than the parental drug Bendamustine.</p><img id=\"imgf000058_0001\" path=\"imgf000058_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/168586844/WO/20100729/A2/002010/08/53/77/imgf000058_0001.tif\"/></p>"
