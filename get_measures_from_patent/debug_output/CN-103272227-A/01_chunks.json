    "matic analysis of the potentiality of holding in conjunction with ditch of II class MHC HLA-DR molecule.Screen the dissolubility of peptide in the acid water environment of this subgroup in advance, and the final group of selecting to have 44 peptides is used for external II class MHC in conjunction with the test of measuring.</p>Method</p>The mensuration that adopts be competitive II class MHC in conjunction with mensuration, wherein analyze every kind of peptide and replace ability from every kind that the studies allotypic known control conjugate of human II class MHC.The allotype and the control peptide that use in this research are presented in the table 2:</p>AllotypeControl peptideSequenceDRB1*0101Influenza hemagglutinin 307-319PKYVKQNTLKLATDRB1*0301Mycobacterium tuberculosis/leprosy bacillus hsp652-16AKTIAYDEEARRGLEDRB1*0401Influenza hemagglutinin 307-319PKYVKQNTLKLATDRB1*0701Influenza hemagglutinin 307-319PKYVKQNTLKLATDRB1*1101Influenza hemagglutinin 307-319PKYVKQNTLKLATDRB1*1301HLA-DQB1*060321-36TERVRLVTRHIYNREEDRB1*1501Human myelin basic protein 85-99ENPVVHFFKNIVTPRDQB1*0602Human insulin B1-15FVNQHLCGSHLVEAL</p>Table 2. is used in external in conjunction with the control peptide in measuring</p>In competition assay, analyze every kind of 44HDM peptide (it is displayed among table 3A and the 3B) and screened the relative combination of comparing with control peptide.Because the character of competitive assay, the data of every kind of peptide are represented as the IC50 of himself and the ratio of the IC50 of control peptide.Therefore, have with the peptide of the similar IC50 value of control peptide and have identical binding affinity, have higher affinity and have the peptide that is less than 1 ratio, and the peptide that has greater than 1 ratio has lower affinity.</p>The result</p>Dissolubility in aqueous solution is that peptide is as the basic standard of effective therapeutic agent.Therefore, as the dissolubility The selection result, we will get rid of a plurality of in conjunction with recording the very hydrophobic peptide that has high-frequency big hydrophobic amino acid residue in (binding registers).This is the feature of mixed and disorderly HLA-DRB1* conjugate.In conjunction with the data show of measuring in table 3B.Shown that every kind of peptide is to every kind of allotypic relative combination in the research.Data show, 24 kinds in 44 kinds of tested peptides are attached to one or more II classes MHC allotype.Observe the cross reactivity of certain limit, namely 5 kinds of peptides are only in conjunction with a kind of allotype, and 8 kinds of peptides are in conjunction with two kinds of allotypes, and 9 kinds of peptides are in conjunction with three kinds of allotypes, and two kinds of peptides are in conjunction with four kinds of different II class MHC allotypes (redness).Expect that also such peptide will have the ability to the similar allotype combination of not testing via the homology of MHC structure.This here observes in the cross reactivity of peptide to DRB1*0101, * 0401, * 0701 and * 1101 under some si"
