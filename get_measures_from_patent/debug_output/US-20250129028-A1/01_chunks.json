    "hering of data regarding a particular result of the exposure to specific experimental conditions. For example, enzymes can be assayed based on their ability to act upon a detectable substrate. A compound can be assayed based on its ability to bind to a particular target molecule or molecules.</p>As used herein, the terms \u201cligand\u201d and \u201cmodulator\u201d are used equivalently to refer to a compound that changes (i.e., increases or decreases) the activity of a target biomolecule, e.g., an enzyme such as those described herein. Generally, a ligand or modulator will be a small molecule, where \u201csmall molecule refers to a compound with a molecular weight of 1500 Daltons or less, 1000 Daltons or less, 800 Daltons or less, or 600 Daltons or less. Thus, an \u201cimproved ligand\u201d is one that possesses better pharmacological and/or pharmacokinetic properties than a reference compound, where \u201cbetter\u201d can be defined by one skilled in the relevant art for a particular biological system or therapeutic use.</p>The term \u201cbinds\u201d in connection with the interaction between a target and a potential binding compound indicates that the potential binding compound associates with the target to a statistically significant degree as compared to association with proteins generally (i.e., non-specific binding). Thus, the term \u201cbinding compound\u201d refers to a compound that has a statistically significant association with a target molecule. In some embodiments, a binding compound interacts with a specified target with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10 mM or less, 1,000 \u03bcM or less, 100 \u03bcM or less, 10 \u03bcM or less, 1 \u03bcM or less, 1,000 nM or less, 100 nM or less, 10 nM or less, or 1 nM or less. In the context of compounds binding to a target, the terms \u201cgreater affinity\u201d and \u201cselective\u201d indicates that the compound binds more tightly than a reference compound, or than the same compound in a reference condition, i.e., with a lower dissociation constant. In some embodiments, the greater affinity is at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 50, 100, 200, 400, 500, 1000, or 10,000-fold greater affinity.</p>The terms \u201cmodulate,\u201d \u201cmodulation,\u201d and the like refer to the ability of a compound to increase or decrease the function and/or expression of a target, such as the interaction between YAP and TEAD, where such function may include transcription regulatory activity and/or binding. Modulation may occur in vitro or in vivo. Modulation, as described herein, includes the inhibition, antagonism, partial antagonism, activation, agonism or partial agonism of a function or characteristic associated with YAP/TEAD, either directly or indirectly, and/or the upregulation or downregulation of the expression YAP/TEAD, either directly or indirectly. In another embodiment, the modulation is direct. Inhibitors or antagonists are compounds that, e.g., bind to, partially or totally block stimulation, decrease, prevent, inhibit, delay activation, inactivate, desensitize, or downregulate signal transduction. Activators or agonists are compounds that, e.g., bind to, stimulate, increase, open, activate, facilitate, enhance activation, activate, sensitize or upregulate signal transduction.</p>As used herein, the terms \u201ctreat,\u201d \u201ctreating,\u201d \u201ctherapy,\u201d \u201ctherapies,\u201d and like terms refer to the administration of material, e.g., any one or more compound(s) as described herein in an amount effective to inhibit YAP/TEAD. In other embodiments, the ter",
    "maintain their therapeutic activity when administered. In one aspect, the other drug therapy may be co-administered with one or more compounds of the disclosure. Use in combination by co-administration includes administration of co-formulations or formulations of chemically joined compounds, or administration of two or more compounds in separate formulations within a short time of each other (e.g. within an hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, up to 24 hours), administered by the same or different routes. Co-administration of separate formulations includes co-administration by delivery via one device, for example the same inhalant device, the same syringe, etc., or administration from separate devices within a short time of each other. Co-formulations of compounds of the disclosure and one or more additional drug therapies delivered by the same route includes preparation of the materials together such that they can be administered by one device, including the separate compounds combined in one formulation, or compounds that are modified such that they are chemically joined, yet still maintain their biological activity. Such chemically joined compounds may have a linkage that is substantially maintained in vivo, or the linkage may break down in vivo, separating the two active components.</p>IV. Methods of UseDisease Indications and Modulations YAP/TEADExemplary Diseases Associated with YAP/TEAD</p>Polycystic Kidney DiseaseYAP and TAZ appear to serve functions in Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) progression. Increased YAP expression was also observed in human PKD patients. TAZ forms a complex with Polycystin-2 (PC2, the protein product of PKD1), thereby targeting it for ubiquitination and degradation. It was observed that TAZ knockout results in PKD, and also results in the down-regulation of other genes necessary for proper cilia development and function implicating YAP as a potential therapeutic target for PKD (Steven W Plouffe et al; Disease Implications of the Hippo/YAP Pathway; Trends Mol Med. 2015 April; 21(4): 212-222.).</p>Neurodegenerative DiseasesHippo pathway components are involved in neurological diseases. For instance, studies reported that YAP/TAZ mediate gene transcription induced by A\u03b2PP, the precursor of Amyloid \u03b2 which is believed to be a driver of Alzheimer's disease implicating YAP as a potential therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease (Steven W Plouffe et al., 2015).</p>Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy and Holt-Oram SyndromeThe Hippo pathway plays a role in heart diseases. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is characterized by thinning of the right ventricular walls, arrhythmias, and replacement of the myocardium with fibroadipocytes. It has been shown that YAP are phosphorylated in human ARVC hearts, and that overexpressing a constitutively active YAP mutant in cardiomyocytes results in adipogenesis, further supporting the role of the Hippo pathway in ARVC and implicating YAP as a potential therapeutic target for ARVC (Steven W Plouffe et al., 2015).</p>Liver CancerYAP is frequently overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and is required to sustain increased cell proliferation and tumor growth. In addition, risk factors for HCC include hepatitis infection and exposure to xenobiotics, and these have also been implicated in activating YAP. For example, the Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) directly increases YAP expression by enhan",
    ". A large variety of assays indicative of binding are known for different target types and can be used for this disclosure.</p>Binding compounds can be characterized by their effect on the activity of the target molecule. Thus, a \u201clow activity\u201d compound has an inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) or effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) of greater than 1 \u03bcM under standard conditions. By \u201cvery low activity\u201d is meant an IC<sub>50 </sub>or EC<sub>50 </sub>of above 100 \u03bcM under standard conditions. By \u201cextremely low activity\u201d is meant an IC<sub>50 </sub>or EC<sub>50 </sub>of above 1 mM under standard conditions. By \u201cmoderate activity\u201d is meant an IC<sub>50 </sub>or EC<sub>50 </sub>of 200 nM to 1 \u03bcM under standard conditions. By \u201cmoderately high activity\u201d is meant an IC<sub>50 </sub>or EC<sub>50 </sub>of 1 nM to 200 nM. By \u201chigh activity\u201d is meant an IC<sub>50 </sub>or EC<sub>50 </sub>of below 1 nM under standard conditions. The IC<sub>50 </sub>or EC<sub>50 </sub>is defined as the concentration of compound at which 50% of the activity of the target molecule (e.g. enzyme or other protein) activity being measured is lost or gained relative to the range of activity observed when no compound is present. Activity can be measured using methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art, e.g., by measuring any detectable product or signal produced by occurrence of an enzymatic reaction, or other activity by a protein being measured.</p>By \u201cbackground signal\u201d in reference to a binding assay is meant the signal that is recorded under standard conditions for the particular assay in the absence of a test compound, molecular scaffold, or ligand that binds to the target molecule. Persons of ordinary skill in the art will realize that accepted methods exist and are widely available for determining background signal.</p>By \u201cstandard deviation\u201d is meant the square root of the variance. The variance is a measure of how spread out a distribution is. It is computed as the average squared deviation of each number from its mean. For example, for the numbers 1, 2, and 3, the mean is 2 and the variance is:</p>\u03c3\u200a2=(1-2)2+(2-2)2+(3-2)23=0.667.</p>Surface Plasmon ResonanceBinding parameters can be measured using surface plasmon resonance, for example, with a BIAcore\u00ae chip (Biacore, Japan) coated with immobilized binding components. Surface plasmon resonance is used to characterize the microscopic association and dissociation constants of reaction between an sFv or other ligand directed against target molecules.
