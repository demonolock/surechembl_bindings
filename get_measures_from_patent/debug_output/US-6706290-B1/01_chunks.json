    "ycline therapy was commenced. She received 500 mg tetracycline HCl 4 times per day for one month, followed by 500 mg twice a day for 5 months. The patient was nanobacteria negative after one month therapy. Her condition was improved simultaneously and she has remained negative in monthly samples.</p>EXAMPLE 6Antibiotic Susceptibility of NanobacteriaAntibiotic sensitivity tests were carried out by measuring Minimal Inhibition Concentration (MIC), a common practice in clinical microbiology.</p>Methods</p>The tests were performed in 96-well plates. DMEM (commercial cell culture medium) containing 10% gamma-irradiated fetal bovine serum (FBS)(dose about 3 Mrads; this treatment inactivates nanobacteria in the serum so that the basic medium is sterile) was used as the basic culture medium. These components are commercially available, e.g., from Gibco. The antibiotic stock solutions were sterile filtered through 0.2 micrometer filters. The stock solutions were then serially diluted (into the basal culture medium) to provide a final starting concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and 1:2 dilutions therefrom, unless otherwise specified. For each antibiotic three parallel tests were performed using all the antibiotic dilutions and, additionally, positive and negative control experiments. Positive controls had nanobacteria with no antibiotic addition, while negative controls had only the basic medium. Nanobacteria were cultured from FBS, human serum from a patient having Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD), and from human kidney stones as described in our earlier work (Kajander and Ciftcioglu, PNAS 95:8274-8279, 1998). 100 \u03bcl of dilutions of the nanobacteria inoculum were added to all wells except the negative controls. The plates were incubated at mammalian cell culture conditions (37\u00b0 Celsius, 5% carbon dioxide, 95% humid air). The absorbance values at 650 nm were recorded by using an ELISA reader at the start, and at 4, 8, 12, 14 days. Final MIC values (50% and 90% inhibition) were calculated at the 12 day time point. Calculations were based on absorbance curves where absorbance was plotted against concentration of the antibiotic.</p>Results</p>The results of these experiments are summarized in Table 5.</p>TABLE 5Summary of MIC 50 and MIC 90 values for selected antibiotics (mg/l):CompoundsMIC 50MIC 90Trimethoprim-Sulphamethaxazole15&gt;500Trimethoprim0.75Tetracycline0.31.3Doxycyclin5080Nitrofurantoin0.61.5Gentamycin60250Neomycin1630Kanamycin50200Vancomycin130250Ampicillin500Cefuroxim&gt;500Pyrazinamide&gt;500Ethambutol&gt;500Metronidasole&gt;500Ciprofloxacine&gt;500Rifampicin&gt;500Clarithromycin&gt;500Clindamycin&gt;500Spectinomycin&gt;500Streptomycin&gt;500Cephalothin&gt;500Erythromycin&gt;500Lincomycin&gt;500Chloramphenicol&gt;500Penicillin&gt;500Polymyxin B&gt;500</p>As can been seen from the results presented in Table 5, the trimethoprim-sulphamethaxazole combination was not as effective as trimethoprim alone (FIG. 24).
