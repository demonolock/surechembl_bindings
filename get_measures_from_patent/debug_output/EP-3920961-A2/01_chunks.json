In some aspects, the growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) receptor antagonists are petides. In some aspects, the growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) receptor antagonists are growth hormone releaseing peptides. For example, MIA-602 is a GHRH-R antagonist having the following amino acid sequence, Tyr- Ala-Asp-Ala-Ile<sup>5</sup>-Phe-Thr-Asn-Ser-Tyr<sup>10</sup>-Arg-Lys-Val-Leu- Gly<sup>15</sup>-Gln-Leu-Ser-Ala-Arg<sup>20</sup>- Lys-Leu-Leu-Gln-Asp<sup>25</sup>-Ile-Met-Ser-Arg<sup>29</sup>-NH2 (SEQ ID NO: 21).

As used herein \"pharmaceutically acceptable\" means molecules and compositions that do not produce or lead to an untoward reaction (i.e., adverse, negative or allergic reaction) when administered to a subject as intended (i.e., as appropriate). </p> [00102] Any of the GHRH antagonists (or a composition comprising any of the GHRH antagonists) can be administered in effective amounts. An\u201ceffective amount\u201d with respect to a GHRH antagonist according to the teachings herein is that amount of a GHRH antagonist composition that alone, or together with further doses, produces the desired response, e.g., treats cancer, decreases the proliferation of cancer cells, inhibits tumor growth, kills tumor cells, treats pulmonary fibrosis, reduces lung inflammation, reduces lung scarring, ameliorates one or more symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis, or reduces expression of one or more T cell receptor complex genes. In the case of treating a cancer or treating pulmonary fibrosis, a desired response can be inhibition of progression of the disease. This may involve slowing the progression of the disease temporarily, although more preferably, it involves halting the progression of the disease permanently.

Female athymic (NCr nu/nu) nude mice, 5- to 6-weeks-old, obtained from the Envigo labs (Tampa, FL), were housed in laminar airflow cabinets under pathogen-free conditions with a 12-h light/12-h dark schedule, and were fed autoclaved standard chow and water. To generate mice with xenografted tumors, tumor xenografts were initiated by subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of 107 human cancer cells into female nude mice. After about 4 weeks the resulting tumors were dissected and collected after removing necrosis tissues. The tumors were then cut into particles with size of ~ 3 mm3 and transplanted s.c. by trocar needle into experimental animals. When tumors grew to the size of 50-60 mm3 (by volume), mice were randomized into groups and treated daily for 4-8 weeks by subcutaneous administration of 5pg of GHRH antagonists MIA-602 or AVR-compounds (2-10pg as indicated), or vehicle solutions (0.1% DMSO in 10% 1, 2-propanediol) respectively. Tumor sizes were measured weekly. </p> [00129] Statistical analysis. One-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni comparison were performed. Data are expressed as Mean \u00b1 SEM. To determine statistical significance between animal groups, two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test was conducted. Differences were considered significant when p &lt; 0.05. \n\n [00130] Results. The five AVR GHRH antagonists shown in Table 3 were shown to have the highest inhibitory effects on tumor growth when compared to GHRH antagonist MIA-602.

Preparation of human pituitary membrane fractions and receptor binding of analogs of GH-RH were performed (Halmos G, Rekasi Z, Szoke B, Schally AV.(1993) Receptor 3:87-97). Human pituitary was purchased from the National Hormone and Peptide Program. In the competitive binding analysis, 1251-labeled [His<sup>1</sup>, Nle<sup>27</sup>]-hGH-RH-(l-32)-NH2 (0.2nM) was displaced by GH-RH-antagonists at 10-6-10- 12 M.

Purpose. Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) is a 44- amino acid peptide that regulates growth hormone (GH) secretion. It was tested whether a GHRH receptor (GHRH-R) antagonist, MIA-602, would inhibit bleomycin-induced lung inflammation and/or fibrosis in C57B1/6J mice. Methods. It was tested whether MIA-602 (5 pg or vehicle given subcutaneously [SC] on days 1-21) would decrease lung inflammation (at day 14) and/or fibrosis (at day 28) in mice treated with intraperitoneal (IP) bleomycin (0.8 units on days 1, 3, 7, 10, 14 and 21). Bleomycin resulted in inflammation and fibrosis around airways and vessels evident histologically at days 14 and 28. Results. Inflammation </p>(histopathologic scores assessed blindly) was less evident in mice treated with MIA-602 for 14 days. After 28 days, lung hydroxyproline (HP) content increase"
