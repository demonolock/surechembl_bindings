    "ministered at a dose of 5.6 mg/kg, s.c.</p>\n  Before a first temperature reading is taken, each guinea pig is placed in a clear plastic\nshoe box containing wood chips and a metal grid floor and allowed to acclimate to the\nsurroundings for 30 minutes. Animals are then returned to the same shoe box after each\ntemperature reading. Prior to each temperature measurement each animal is firmly held with\none hand for a 30-second period. A digital thermometer with a small animal probe is used for\ntemperature measurements. The probe is made of semi-flexible nylon with an epoxy tip. The\ntemperature probe is inserted 6 cm. into the rectum and held there for 30 seconds or until a\nstable recording is obtained. Temperatures are then recorded.</p>\n  In p.o. screening experiments, a \"pre-drug\" baseline temperature reading is made at\n-90 minutes, the test compound is given at -60 minutes and an additional -30 minute reading is\ntaken. The 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> agonist is then administered at 0 minutes and temperatures are taken 30,\n60, 120 and 240 minutes later. In subcutaneous screening experiments, a pre-drug baseline\ntemperature reading is made at -30 minutes. The test compound and 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> agonists are\ngiven concurrently and temperatures are taken at 30, 60, 120 and 240 minutes later. Data are\nanalyzed with two-way analysis of variants with repeated measures in Newman-Keuls post hoc\nanalysis. </p>\n  The serotonin 5-HT<sub>1</sub> agonist activity can be determined by in vitro receptor binding\nassay, as described for the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor using rat cortex as the receptor source and [<sup>3</sup>H]-8-OH-DPAT\nas the radioligand [D. Hoyer et al. Eur. J. Pharm., 118, 13 (1985)] and as described\nfor the 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptor using bovine caudate as the receptor source and [<sup>3</sup>H]serotonin as the\nradioligand [R.E. Heuring and S.J. Peroutka, J. Neuroscience, 7, 894 (1987)]; the contents of\nthese documents are incorporated herein by reference.</p>\n  The binding activity at the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor is, for example, determined according to the\nfollowing procedure. Male Sprague-Dawley rats are decapitated and their brains removed.\nFrontal cortices are dissected and homogenized in 50 mM Tris HCI buffer (pH 7.4 at 4\u00b0C)\ncontaining 2 mM MgCl2 using a Polytron homogenizer (setting 15,000 rpm). The homogenate\nis centrifuged for ten minutes at 40,000 x g (20,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS34 rotor). The\nsupernatant was discarded and the pellet resuspended with the Polytron homogenizer in fresh\nice-cold 50 mM TRIS HCI (pH 7.4 at 4\u00b0C) buffer containing 2 mM MgCl2 and centrifuged again.\nThe final pellet was resuspended in 50 mM Tris HCI buffer (pH 7.7 at 22\u00b0C) for a final tissue\nconcentration of 9 mgs wet weight tissue per mL buffer. Incubation is initiated by the addition\nof tissue to V-bottom polypropylene 96 well plates (in triplicate). Incubation is at 37\u00b0C for 15\nminutes in a water bath. Each tube receives 200 \u00b5L tissue suspension, 25 \u00b5L <sup>3</sup>H-k"
