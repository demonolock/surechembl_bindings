For example, the compounds may be radiolabeled with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (\u00be), iodine-125 (<sup>125</sup>I), \n<!-- EPO <DP n=\"16\"/>-->\nsulfur-35 (<sup>35</sup>S), or carbon-14 (<sup>14</sup>C), or may be isotopically enriched, such as with deuterium (<sup>2</sup>H), carbon-13 (<sup>13</sup>C), or nitrogen-15 (<sup>15</sup>N). As used herein, an \u201cisotopologue\u201d is an isotopically enriched compound. The term \u201cisotopically enriched\u201d refers to an atom having an isotopic composition other than the natural isotopic composition of that atom. \u201cIsotopically enriched\u201d may also refer to a compound containing at least one atom having an isotopic composition other than the natural isotopic composition of that atom. The term \u201cisotopic composition\u201d refers to the amount of each isotope present for a given atom. Radiolabeled and isotopically encriched compounds are useful as therapeutic agents, e.g., cancer therapeutic agents, research reagents, e.g., binding assay reagents, and diagnostic agents, e g., in vivo imaging agents. All isotopic variations of the compounds as described herein, whether radioactive or not, are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the embodiments provided herein. In some embodiments, there are provided isotopologues of the compounds disclosed herein, for example, the isotopologues are deuterium, carbon-13, and/or nitrogen-15 enriched compounds. As used herein, \u201cdeuterated\u201d, means a compound wherein at least one hydrogen (H) has been replaced by deuterium (indicated by D or <sup>2</sup>H), that is, the compound is enriched in deuterium in at least one position. </p><p id=\"p0090\" num=\"0090\">[0068] It is understood that, independently of stereoisomerical or isotopic composition, each compound disclosed herein can be provided in the form of any of the pharmaceutically acceptable salts discussed herein. Equally, it is understood that the isotopic composition may vary independently from the stereoisomerical composition of each compound referred to herein. Further, the isotopic composition, while being restricted to those elements present in the respective compound or salt thereof disclosed herein, may otherwise vary independently from the selection of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the respective compound. </p><p id=\"p0091\" num=\"0091\">[0069] It should be noted that if there is a discrepancy between a depicted structure and a name for that structure, the depicted structure is to be acco",

Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended, and homogenized in membrane preparation buffer (10 mM HEPES and 10 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) using a Polytron PT 1200E homogenizer (Kinematica, Luzern, Switzerland). Cellular proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 48,000 x g at 4\u00b0C for 30 minutes. The resulting supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was re-suspended again in membrane preparation buffer, homogenized for a second time, and then centrifuged again as described above. The final cellular protein pellet was suspended in ice cold resuspension buffer (10 mM HEPES and 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4), divided into aliquots, and stored at -80\u00b0C until use. </p><p id=\"p1166\" num=\"1166\">Example B2.

For NSB wells, 40 pL/well of 50 pM GTPyS (Sigma Aldrich, cat# G8634, St. Louis, MO) was added to wells containing 0.4 pL of DMSO. The assay was started by the addition of 120 pL/well of CHO-S1P receptor membrane solution containing 40 pg/mL of membrane protein, 16.67 pM guanosine diphosphate (GDP; Sigma Aldrich, cat# G7127, St. Louis, MO), and 2.5 mg/mL of WGA PVT SPA beads in complete buffer.
