    "vely removed if ACh (1 \u03bcM) caused less than 10% relaxation of aortic rings pre-contracted with PE.</p>To examine the possible role of nitric oxide, prostacyclin, and the cyclic GMP relaxant pathway in the effects of the testing drug, the concentration-response curves to ACh are measured in aortic rings incubated with and in continued presence of N-nitro-1-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 10 \u03bcM)\u2014an eNOs inhibitor, indomethacin (10 \u03bcM)\u2014a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, and methylene blue (10 \u03bcM)\u2014a cyclic GMP inhibitor, respectively.</p>To examine the contribution of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) or potassium (K+) channels in the effects of the test drug, the aortic rings are partially depolarized by increasing concentration of KCl in the KPSS (4.8-20 mM), and the concentration-response curves to ACh is then performed.</p>Statistical Analysis</p>The contractile responses of aortic rings to graded concentrations of PE are expressed as percentages of the maximum contractile effect of high K<sup>+</sup> in respective tissues.</p>The vasodilator effect of increasing concentrations of ACh or SNP are expressed as percent decrease of the peak PE (10<sup>\u22126 </sup>M) contraction.</p>The concentration-response curve for each experimental condition is plotted and from it are deduced the values of maximal contraction (Cmax) or maximal relaxation (Rmax) and the concentration of the testing drug (expressed as negative log molar) producing 50% of maximum contraction or relaxation (pEC50) recorded (Prism Version 2.0, GraphPad Software, USA).</p>It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes could be made to the embodiments described above without departing from the broad inventive concept thereof. It is understood, therefore, that this invention is not limited to the particular embodiments disclosed, but it is intended to cover modifications within the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>REFERENCE1.
