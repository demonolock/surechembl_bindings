The crystalline residue was dissolved in DMF (5 mL) and (1R,2S)-1-amino-2-vinyl-cyclopropane carboxylic acid ethyl ester hydrochloride (60 mg, 0.313 mmol) and diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) (138 \u03bcL, 0.792 mmol) were added and the solution was cooled to 0\u00b0 C. HATU (120 mg, 0.316 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred for 0.5 h at 0\u00b0 C. and for an additional 2 h at room temperature. The mixture was then evaporated and extracted with EtOAc, washed with brine, dried, filtered and concentrated. Purification by flash column chromatography (toluene/EtOAc 1:1) provided the title compound (86 mg, 89%) as a colourless oil. The afforded oil was crystallised from ethyl acetate-hexane.</p>Example 41Activity of Compounds of Formula (I)Replicon AssayThe compounds of formula (I) were examined for activity in the inhibition of HCV RNA replication in a cellular assay. The assay demonstrated that the compounds of formula (I) exhibited activity against HCV replicons functional in a cell culture. The cellular assay was based on a bicistronic expression construct, as described by Lohmann et al. (1999) Science vol. 285 pp. 110-113 with modifications described by Krieger et al. (2001) Journal of Virology 75: 4614-4624, in a multi-target screening strategy. In essence, the method was as follows.</p>The assay utilized the stably transfected cell line Huh-7 luc/neo (hereafter referred to as Huh-Luc). This cell line harbors an RNA encoding a bicistronic expression construct comprising the wild type NS3-NS5B regions of HCV type 1b translated from an Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) from encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), preceded by a reporter portion (FfL-luciferase), and a selectable marker portion (neo<sup>R</sup>, neomycine phosphotransferase). The construct is bordered by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 NTRs (non-translated regions) from HCV type 1b. Continued culture of the replicon cells in the presence of G418 (neo<sup>R</sup>) is dependent on the replication of the HCV RNA. The stably transfected replicon cells that express HCV RNA, which replicates autonomously and to high levels, encoding inter alia luciferase, are used for screening the antiviral compounds.</p>The replicon cells were plated in 384 well plates in the presence of the test and control compounds which were added in various concentrations. Following an incubation of three days, HCV replication was measured by assaying luciferase activity (using standard luciferase assay substrates and reagents and a Perkin Elmer ViewLux\u2122 ultraHTS microplate imager). Replicon cells in the control cultures have high luciferase expression in the absence of any inhibitor. The inhibitory activity of the compound on luciferase activity was monitored on the Huh-Luc cells, enabling a dose-response curve for each test compound. EC50 values were then calculated, which value represents the amount of the compound required to decrease by 50% the level of detected luciferase activity, or more specifically, the ability of the genetically linked HCV replicon. RNA to replicate.</p>Inhibition AssayThe aim of this in vitro assay was to measure the inhibition of HCV NS3/4A protease complexes by the compounds of the present invention. This assay provides an indication of how effective compounds of the present invention would be in inhibiting HCV NS3/4A proteolytic activity.</p>The inhibition of full-length hepatitis C NS3 protease enzyme was measured essentially as described in Poliakov, 2002 Prot Expression &amp; Purification 25 363 371. Briefly, the hydrolysis of a depsipeptide substrate, Ac-DED(Edans)EEAbu\u03c8[COO]ASK(Dabcyl)-NH<sub>2 </sub>(AnaSpec, San Jos\u00e9, USA), was measured spectrofluorometrically in the presence of a peptide cofactor, KKGSVVIVGRIVLSGK (\u212bke Engstr\u00f6m, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology, Uppsala University, Sweden). [Landro, 1997 #Biochem 36 9340-9348]. The enzyme (1 nM) was incubated in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mM DTT, 40% glycerol, 0.1% n-octyl-D-glucoside, with 25 \u03bcM NS4A cofactor and inhibitor at 30\u00b0 C. for 10 min, whereupon the reaction was initiated by addition of 0.5 \u03bcM substrate. Inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO, sonicated for 30 sec. and vortexed. The solutions were stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. between measurements.</p>The final concentration of DMSO in the assay sample was adjusted to 3.3%. The rate of hydrolysis was corrected for inner filter effects according to published procedures. [Liu, 1999 Analytical Biochemistry 267 331-335]. Ki values were estimated by non-linear regression analysis (GraFit, Erithacus Software, Staines, MX, UK), using a model for competitive inhibition and a fixed value for Km (0.15 \u03bcM). A minimum of two replicates was performed for all measurements.</p>The following Table 1 lists compounds that were prepared according to any one of the above examples. The activities of the compounds tested are also depicted in Table 1.</p>EC<sub>50 </sub>(\u03bcM)Ki (\u03bcM)Compound nr.structureReplicon assayEnzymatic assay29<img id=\"EMI-C00177\" path=\"US20090281140A1-20091112-C00177.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/87691291/US/20091112/A1/020090/28/11/40/US20090281140A1-20091112-C00177.TIF\"/>10\u2014 47<img id=\"EMI-C00178\" path=\"US20090281140A1-20091112-C00178.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/87691184/US/20091112/A1/020090/28/11/40/US20090281140A1-20091112-C00178.TIF\"/>0.006180.00050 46<img id=\"EMI-C00179\" path=\"US20090281140A1-20091112-C00179.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/87691009/US/20091112/A1/020090/28/11/40/US20090281140A1-20091112-C00179.TIF\"/>0.91\u2014 91<img id=\"EMI-C00180\" path=\"US20090281140A1-20091112-C00180.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/87690963/US/20091112/A1/020090/28/11/40/US20090281140A1-20091112-C00180.TIF\"/>8.54 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22123</sup>5.00 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22125</sup> 55<img id=\"EMI-C00181\" path=\"US20090281140A1-20091112-C00181.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/87691390/US/20091112/A1/020090/28/11/40/US20090281140A1-20091112-C00181.TIF\"/>0.367430755.00 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22123</sup> 81<img id=\"EMI-C00182\" path=\"US20090281140A1-20091112-C00182.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/87691072/US/20091112/A1/020090/28/11/40/US20090281140A1-20091112-C00182.TIF\"/>101 82<img id=\"EMI-C00183\" path=\"US20090281140A1-20091112-C00183.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/87691324/US/20091112/A1/020090/28/11/40/US2009028"
