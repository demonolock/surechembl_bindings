    "D (PIK3CA H1047R) cells were cultured using 10-cm petri dishes with recommended medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. One day before the assay, cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a final density of 10,000 cells per well. After overnight incubation in complete medium, cells were treated with different concentrations of PI3Ka inhibitors for 2 h. Cells were then fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min. Aspirate 4% paraformaldehyde, and wash cells using IX regular phosphate buffered saline 3 times, 5 min each. Aspirate any residual phosphate buffered saline and block cells using 10% goat serum containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.3% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 1 h. Without any additional washing, primary antibodies (rabbit anti-pSer473 AKT) were diluted using blocking buffer and added at a final volume of 50 microliter per well. Keep assay plates with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C. Wash cells using IX regular phosphate buffered saline 3 times, 5 min each. After the final wash, incubate cells with horseradish peroxidase -conjugated secondary antibodies (goat Anti -rabbit IgG) diluted using the same blocking buffer at room temperature \n\nfor 1 h. Wash cells thoroughly using IX regular phosphate buffered saline 3 times, 5 min each. Aspirate any residual phosphate buffered saline. Add Super-Signal ELISA Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate at a final volume of 100 microliter per well. Read plates on i3x Multi-Mode Microplate Reader and calculate IC50 values using GraphPad Prism software. </p>Results of the assay described above are presented in Table A.

One day before the assay, cells were seeded in 96-well plates. After overnight incubation, the medium was changed to DMEM with 2.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and the cells were treated with different concentrations of the compounds for 2 h. Cells were then fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min. Aspirate 4% paraformaldehyde, and wash cells using IX regular phosphate buffered saline 3 times, 5 min each.
