For controls, equivalent volumes of DMSO were used. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde prior to fluorescence microscopy and cell nuclei were stained with 0.5 \u03bcg/ml DAPI. Due to fluorescence emitted by Compound A in the GFP channel, the Compound A signal had to be excluded from the GFP signal by separating the emission spectra. A Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope was used and images captured using the ZEN 2009 camera with associated AxioVision software (version 4.7). Pictures were edited using the Zeiss image browser. For quantification, 100 cells from each condition were analysed using Image J.</p>Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Protein Extraction</p>Nuclear and cytoplasmic protein fractionation was performed using the NE-PER Nuclear Protein Extraction Kit (ThermoScientific, Rockford, Ill., USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. CaSki cells were either treated with the IC50 of Compound A for 48 hours, or transfected with 20 nM control siRNA (sc-37007, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or Kpn\u03b21 siRNA (sc-35736, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 96 hours, prior to protein extraction. Western Blot analysis was performed using a goat anti-Karyopherin \u03b12 (C-20) antibody (sc-6917, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and a rabbit Santi-NFYA (H-209) antibody (sc-10779, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). An anti-\u03b2-tubulin (H-235) antibody (sc-9104, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to control for cytoplasmic protein loading and a rabbit anti-TATA-box binding protein (TBP) (N-12) a antibody (sc-204, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to control for nuclear protein loading. Densitometry was performed using Image J.</p>Luciferase Assays</p>To assay for AP-1 and p65 luciferase activities, 40 000 CaSki cells were plated in 24-well plates, and transfected with 50 ng of an API luciferase reporter (containing four copies of the AP-1 binding site) or 50 ng of a p65 luciferase reporter (containing five copies of the p65 binding site, Clontech, CA, USA) and 5 ng pRL-TK (encoding Renilla luciferase, Promega), using 0.16 \u03bcl TransFectin\u2122 lipid reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif., USA). The following day cells were treated with 10 or 15 \u03bcM Compound A. Luciferase activity was measured 24 hours after Compound A treatment using the Dual-LuciferaseR Reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, Wis., USA), according to the manufacturers' instructions. Luciferase readings were measured using the Veritas\u2122 microp",
    "o the nuclear import of NFAT (FIG. 16). Treatment with Compound A, Compound II and Compound III significantly diminished NFAT activation, in a dose-dependent manner, presumably due to its inhibition of NFAT nuclear import (FIGS. 16, 17 and 18). As a positive control, cells were treated with Ivermectin, a broad-spectrum anti-parasitic that was recently found to inhibit Karyopherin \u03b1/\u03b2-mediated nuclear transport (Wagstraff et al., 2012; Wagstaff K M, Rawlinson S M, Hearps A C, Jans D A. An AlphaScreen\u00ae-based assay for high-throughput screening for specific inhibitors of nuclear import. J Biomol Screen 2011 February; 16(2):192-200). An NFAT assay was performed using Ivermectin, and similar to the result obtained with Compound A, the induction of NFAT activity was significantly diminished upon Ivermectin treatment (FIG. 19). Finally, NFAT activation was measured after treatment of cells with AG1478, a EGF-R inhibitor, and no change in NFAT activation was observed (FIG. 20).</p>Cancer Cell Death Via Cell Cycle Arrest and the Induction of Apoptosis</p>To identify a nuclear import inhibitor with anti-cancer activity, the cell-killing effect of Compound A was tested using a panel of cell lines of various origins. Amongst the cell lines tested, Compound A did not show preference for a particular cancer type and was found to kill cancer cell lines of cervical (HeLa, CaSki), oesophageal (WHCO1, WHCO5, WHCO6), ovarian (A2780, CP70 and OVCAR3) and breast origin (MDA-MB-231, MCF7) with an IC50 of approximately 10 \u03bcM (Table 11).</p>TABLE 11IC50 values for cancer cells, transformed cells andnon-cancer cells treated with Compound A.Cell typeCell lineIC50 (\u03bcM)95% Confidence IntervalCancer/CaSki9.33\u20026.51-13.38transformedHeLa8.778.12-9.38KYSE308.848.45-9.26KYSE15011.7210.48-13.10WHCO110.62\u20029.55-11.81WHCO59.09\u20028.11-16.15WHCO611.9911.42-12.57A27805.795.63-5.95CP707.707.58-7.81OVCAR310.4610.21-10.71MCF12A12.74\u20029.19-17.65MCF79.33\u20028.34-10.42MDA-MB-2317.927.32-8.56SVWI3810.44\u20029.95-10.95Non-cancerFG021.4218.86-24.32WI3824.0218.96-30.43DMB31.3829.32-33.59</p>Importantly, Compound A showed elevated toxicity in the cancer or transformed cell lines relative to the non-cancer fibroblast lines. It showed about 2- to 3-fold selectivity toward cancer or transformed cell lines over non-cancer fibroblast cells.</p>To confirm that Compound A was more effective at killing cancer cells compared to non-cancer cells, representative cancer (cervical and oesophageal) and non-cancer cell lines, were grown in the presence of Compound A, and cell proliferation measured daily for five days, using MTT assays. FIG. 21 shows that the cancer cells were highly sensitive to Compound A, as within 24 hour complete cell death was observed at concentrations of 10 and 15 \u03bcM Compound A (FIG. 21 A-D). This effect was sustained for the full 5 day time period, confirming that there was no population of cells that recovered from the treatment.</p>Non-cancer fibroblast cells, however, proliferated relatively normally in the presence of 10 \u03bcM Compound A, but at 15 \u03bcM Compound A cell death occurred within 24-48 hours (FIGS. 21 E and F). The result points to the differential sensitivity of cancer and non-cancer cells to Compound A, where at 10 \u03bcM Compound A treatment the cancer cells underwent 100% cell death, whilst the non-cancer cells were relatively unaffected (FIG. 22). While the IC50 for the non-cancer cells was previously shown to be in the 20-30 NM range, the cells died at 15 \u03bcM due to fewer cells being plated in the cell proliferation assay.</p>The anchorage-independent proliferation of cancer cells was measured in response to Compound A treatment, as cells grown in this manner are more representative of tumour cells in vivo. Cells were grown on polyheme-coated plates and cell proliferation monitored 9 days after treatment, using MTT assays. It was observed that both cervical and oesophageal cancer cells were unable to form colonies when grown in the presence of 10 \u03bcM Compound A, unlike their untreated counterparts (FIG. 23), confirming the ability of Compound A to block both anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent proliferation of cancer cells.</p>The mechanism of Compound A-induced cell death was investigated. A cell cycle analysis was performed and it was found that Compound A treatment resulted in an increase in the percentage of cells in the G1 stage of the cell cycle, and a corresponding decrease in the percentage of cells in the S and G2/M stages (FIGS. 24 and 25). The induction of a cell cycle block suggested that apoptosis might be activated; hence the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP-1) was measured by Western Blot analysis as an indicator of apoptosis. PARP-1 is cleaved into fragments of 89 and 24 kDa during apoptosis (Duriez P J, Shah G M. Cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase: a sensitive parameter to study cell d"
