    "dentical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one \u201clight\u201d and one \u201cheavy\u201d chain. The variable regions of each light/heavy chain pair form an antibody binding site. An antibody may be from any species. The term antibody also includes binding fragments, including, but not limited to Fv, Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032)2 single stranded antibody (svFC), dimeric variable region (Diabody) and disulphide-linked variable region (dsFv). In particular, antibodies include immunoglobulin molecules and immunologically active fragments of immunoglobulin molecules, i.e., molecules that contain an antigen binding site. Antibody fragments may or may not be fused to another immunoglobulin domain including but not limited to, an Fc region or fragment thereof. The skilled artisan will further appreciate that other fusion products may be generated including but not limited to, scFv-Fc fusions, variable region (e.g., VL and VH)\u02dcFc fusions and scFv-scFv-Fc fusions.</p>In some embodiments, the VH and VL are connected by a peptide linker. In the design of antigen binding fragments for use as antibodies peptide linkers between the VH and VL are well known, and any linker effective in generating a binding pocket that successfully binds to the target receptor may be used. In some embodiments, the peptide linker comprises the amino acid sequence GGSSRSSSSGGGGSGGGG (SEQ ID NO: 4) or GGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGS (SEQ ID NO: 5).</p>In some embodiments, the target receptor-binding domain binds the target receptor with a dissociation constant (Kd) of at least 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100 pM. Each possibility represents a separate embodiment of the invention. In some embodiments, the target receptor-binding domain binds the target receptor with a Kd of between 0.1 and 100, 0.1 and 200, 0.1 and 300, 0.1 and 400, 0.1 and 500, 0.1 and 600, 0.1 and 700, 0.1 and 800, 0.1 and 900, 0.1 and 1000, 0.1 and 2000, 0.1 and 3000, 0.5 and 100, 0.5 and 200, 0.5 and 300, 0.5 and 400, 0.5 and 500, 0.5 and 600, 0.5 and 700, 0.5 and 800, 0.5 and 900, 0.5 and 1000, 0.5 and 2000, 0.5 and 3000, 1 and 100, 1 and 200, 1 and 300, 1 and 400, 1 and 500, 1 and 600, 1 and 700, 1 and 800, 1 and 900, 1 and 1000, 1 and 2000, or 1 and 3000 pM. Each possibility represents a separate embodiment of the invention.</p>In some embodiments, the target receptor-binding domain binds the target receptor with a half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of at least 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100 nM. Each possibility represents a separate embodiment of the invention. In some embodiments, the target receptor-binding domain binds the target receptor with a EC50 of between 0.1 and 100, 0.1 and 200, 0.1 and 300, 0.1 and 400, 0.1 and 500, 0.1 and 600, 0.1 and 700, 0.1 and 800, 0.1 and 900, 0.1 and 1000, 0.1 and 2000, 0.1 and 3000, 0.5 and 100, 0.5 and 200, 0.5 and 300, 0.5 and 400, 0.5 and 500, 0.5 and 600, 0.5 and 700, 0.5 and 800, 0.5 and 900, 0.5 and 1000, 0.5 and 2000, 0.5 and 3000, 1 and 100, 1 and 200, 1 and 300, 1 and 400, 1 and 500, 1 and 600, 1 and 700, 1 and 800, 1 and 900, 1 and 1000, 1 and 2000, or 1 and 3000 nM. Each possibility represents a separate embodiment of the invention.</p>Transmembrane DomainTransmembrane domains are well known in the art and generally contain hydrophobic residues. In some embodiments, the transmembrane domain is a known transmembrane domain from a naturally occurring protein. In some embodiments, the transmembrane domain is from a murine transmembrane protein. In some embodiments, the transmembrane domain is from a human transmembrane protein. In some embodiments, the transmembrane domain is a synthetic transmembrane domain. The methods and compositions of the invention may be performed with any transmembrane domain that results in anchorage of the chimeric polypeptide of the invention in the plasma membrane with the target receptor-binding domain in the extracellular region and the intracellular region lacking the capability of transducing an immune cell activating signal.</p>In some embodiments, the transmembrane domain is a single-pass transmembrane domain.
