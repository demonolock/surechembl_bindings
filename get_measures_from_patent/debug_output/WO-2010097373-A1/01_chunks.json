The subsequent reduction of the oximes then provides compounds of the general formula</p>Method Description for Cynomolgus B1 Receptor Binding</p>CHO cells expressing the cynomolgus B1 receptor are termed \"HAM <sup>'S</sup> S-12</p>From confluent cultures, the medium is removed, the cells are washed with PBS buffer, scraped or detached with versene and by</p>Centrifuging isolated. Subsequently, the cells are homogenized in suspension, the homogenate is centrifuged and resuspended. After determination of the protein content, 200 \u03bcl of the homogenate (50 to 250 \u03bcg protein / assay) are incubated for 60-180 minutes at room temperature with 0.5 to 5.0 nM kallidine (DesArg10, Leu9), [3,4-prolyl-3,43H (N) ] and increasing concentrations of the test substance are incubated in a total volume of 250 \u03bcl. Incubation is terminated by rapid filtration through GF / B glass fiber filters pre-treated with polyethyleneimines (0.3%). The radioactivity bound to the protein is measured with a TopCount NXT. Non-specific binding is defined as the bound radioactivity in the presence of 1.0 \u03bcM (DesArgi O) kallidine. The analysis of the concentration-binding curve can be carried out by means of a computer-aided non-linear curve fitting in order to determine the corresponding K <sub>1</sub> value for the test substance.</p>Test results from the cynoBKI receptor binding assay:</p><img id=\"imgf000047_0001\" path=\"imgf000047_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/168641047/WO/20100902/A1/002010/09/73/73/imgf000047_0001.tif\"/><img id=\"imgf000048_0001\" path=\"imgf000048_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/168641048/WO/20100902/A1/002010/09/73/73/imgf000048_0001.tif\"/><img id=\"imgf000049_0001\" path=\"imgf000049_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/168641049/WO/20100902/A1/002010/09/73/73/imgf000049_0001.tif\"/><img id=\"imgf000050_0001\" path=\"imgf000050_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/168641050/WO/20100902/A1/002010/09/73/73/imgf000050_0001.tif\"/><img id=\"imgf000051_0001\" path=\"imgf000051_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/168641051/WO/20100902/A1/002010/09/73/73/imgf000051_0001.tif\"/><img id=\"imgf000052_0001\" path=\"imgf000052_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/168641052/WO/20100902/A1/002010/09/73/73/imgf000052_0001.tif\"/><img id=\"imgf000053_0001\" path=\"imgf000053_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/168641053/WO/20100902/A1/002010/09/73/73/imgf000053_0001.tif\"/><img id=\"imgf000054_0001\" path=\"imgf000054_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/168641054/WO/20100902/A1/002010/09/73/73/imgf000054_0001.tif\"/></p>INDICATIONS</p>Due to their pharmacological properties, the new compounds and their physiologically acceptable salts are suitable for the trea"
