    "al test concentration and DMSO at 2.7% resulting in 0.9% final DMSO concentration in the assay.</p>FLIPR Assay:</p>At the assay day cells were washed 3\u00d7 with assay buffer (as described above), 10 \u03bcL buffer remained in the wells after washing. 10 \u03bcL Ca kit loading buffer (AAT Bioquest; prepared from the kit containing the following components: Component A: Fluo-8 NW dissolved in 200 \u03bcL DMSO and 20 \u03bcl of this solution are mixed with 10 ml buffer prepared out of component B and C, Component B: 10\u00d7 Pluronic\u00ae F127 Plus diluted 1:10 in component C, Component C: HHBS (Hanks with 20 mM Hepes) was added to the cells and the plates were incubated with lid for 60 minutes at room temperature. 20 \u03bcl assay buffer containing 60 \u03bcM glycine (20 \u03bcM final) and 3 \u03bcM glutamate (1 \u03bcM final) was added to column 1-23, column 24 got assay buffer without glycine/glutamate to serve as negative unstimulated control. Fluorescence (indicating the calcium influx as a result of the NR1/NR2B ion channel activation) was read on the FLIPRtetra device for 60 seconds to monitor the glutamate induced effects. After 2 minutes 20 \u03bcL of compound dilution prepared as described above or controls (row 1-22) in assay buffer were carefully added to the wells. Fluorescence was read on the FLIPR tetra device for additional 6 minutes to monitor the compound induced effects after activation by agonists. The average of 2 measurements at 5 minutes and 5 min 10 seconds after compound addition is calculated and further used for IC50 calculations. Each assay microtiter compound dilution plate contained wells (in column 23 or 24) with DMSO controls instead of compound as controls for glycine/glutamate induced fluorescence (high controls) and wells with 1 \u03bcM of a reference NR2B NAM as low controls (Compound 22; reference: Layton, Mark E et al, ACS Chemical Neuroscience 2011, 2(7), 352-362).</p>Data Evaluation and Calculation:</p>The output file of the reader contains the well number and measured average fluorescence units. For data evaluation and calculation, the measurement of the low control was set as 0% control and the measurement of the high control was set as 100% control. The IC50 values were calculated using the standard 4 parameter logistic regression formula. Calculation: [y=(a\u2212d)/(1+(x/c){circumflex over (\u2003)}b)+d], a=low value, d=high value; x=conc M; c=IC50 M; b=slope.</p>NR2B negative allosteric modulators covered by general structure A and exhibiting a low IC<sub>50 </sub>value are preferred.</p>TABLE 1In vitro NR2B affinity of the compounds of the presentinvention as obtained in the FLIPR assayExample numberIC50 [nM]196821233690412005110687710028856921018222305953152433807346443519736542</p>TABLE 2In vitro NR2B affinity of the closest prior art compounds(examples 100, 105, 106 and 107 in WO2015/130905) as obtainedin the same FLIPR assay as compounds in table 1Example number inWO2015/130905IC50 [nM]100&gt;8887105&gt;9261106&gt;9255107&gt;9257</p>Determination of Nay 1.6. Inhibition</p>Equipment:</p>IonWorks Quattro electrophysiological platform</p>Compound Plate Preparation</p>The compounds were prepared in DMSO at 300\u00d7 the final assay concentrations of 1 and 5 \u03bcM.</p>The 300\u00d7 DMSO stock solutions were transferred into assay plates where 2 \u03bcl per well of each 300\u00d7 stock solution were placed. All assay plates were stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. until the day of assay.</p>On the day of the assay, the appropriate assay plate was thawed at room temperature, centrifuged, and 198 \u03bcl of external recording solution was added and mixed thoroughly. This provided a 1:100 dilution. A further 1:3 dilution occurred upon addition to the cells in the IonWorks Quattro electrophysiological platform, giving a 1:300 dilution in total. On each assay plate, at least 8 wells were reserved for vehicle control (0.3% DMSO) and at least 8 wells for each positive control specific to the cell line tested. The positive controls were tested at a maximal blocking and an approximate IC50 concentration. As positive control Lidocaine at concentrations of 30 and 1000 \u03bcM was used.</p>Electrophysiological Recording Solutions</p>The solutions for recording Nav1.6 currents were as follows:</p>External Recording Solution</p>NaCl 137 mM</p>KCl 4 mM</p>MgCl<sub>2 </sub>1 mM</p>CaCl<sub>2</sub>) 1.8 mM</p>HEPES 10 mM</p>Glucose 10 mM</p>pH 7.3 (titrated with 10M NaOH)</p>Internal Recording Solution</p>CsF 90 mM</p>CsCl 45 mM</p>HEPES 10 mM</p>EGTA 10 mM</p>pH 7.3 (titrated with 1M CsOH)</p>Amphotericin B was used to obtain electrical access to the cell interior at a final concentration of 200 \u03bcg/ml in internal recording solution.</p>Experimental Protocols &amp; Data Analysis</p>Nav1.6 Experimental Protocol</p>State-dependent inhibition: Sodium channels when held at depolarized potential or long test pulse, the channels open and inactivate and then stay inactivated until the membrane potential is stepped back to hyperpolarized potentials, when the inactivated channels recover from inactivation into closed state. An example is Tetracaine inhibition (FIG. 1), which is much stronger at depolarized potentials than at hyperpolarized potential.</p>Nav1.6 Data Analysis</p>Cells were held at \u2212120 mV. In order to completely inactivate the sodium channels (pulse 1), the cells were pulsed to +0 mV for 2500 ms and stepped back to \u2212120 mV for 10 ms (to completely recover from inactivation, however channels that had drugs bound to them will not recover from inactivation) before s"
