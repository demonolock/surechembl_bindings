{"raw_mentions": "Unfortunately, the provided text snippet does not contain any sentences or table rows that meet the specified criteria, which require the presence of:\n\n1. A specific molecule name, ID, or other identifier.\n2. A bioactivity metric (IC50, Ki, Kd, EC50, and their variations).\n3. A specific numeric value for that metric.\n4. A unit for that value.\n\nThe text primarily describes methods, procedures, and general information about the compounds and their effects on mGluR2 receptors, without providing specific data that includes all four required components. Therefore, there are no sentences or rows to extract based on the given criteria."}
