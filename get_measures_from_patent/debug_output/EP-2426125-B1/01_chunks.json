Pharmacological examplesThe compounds provided in the present invention are positive allosteric modulators of mGluR2. These compounds appear to potentiate glutamate responses by binding to an allosteric site other than the glutamate binding site. The response of mGluR2 to a concentration of glutamate is increased when compounds of Formula (I) are present. Compounds of Formula (I) are expected to have their effect substantially at mGluR2 by virtue of their ability to enhance the function of the receptor. The behaviour of positive allosteric modulators tested at mGluR2 using the [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP\u03b3S binding assay method described below and which is suitable for the identification of such compounds, and more particularly the compounds according to Formula (I), are shown in Table 4.</p>[<sup>35</sup>S]GTP\u03b3S binding assayThe [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP\u03b3S binding is a functional membrane-based assay used to study G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) function whereby incorporation of a non-hydrolysable form of GTP, [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP\u03b3S (guanosine 5'-triphosphate, labelled with gamma-emitting <sup>35</sup>S), is measured. The G-protein \u03b1 subunit catalyzes the exchange of guanosine 5'-diphosphate (GDP) by guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and on activation of the GPCR by an agonist, [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP\u03b3S, becomes incorporated and cannot be cleaved to continue the exchange cycle (Harper (1998) Current Protocols in Pharmacology 2.6.1-10, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.). The amount of radioactive [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP\u03b3S incorporation is a direct measure of the activity of the G-protein and hence the activity of the agonist can be determined. mGluR2 receptors are shown to be preferentially coupled to G\u03b1i-protein, a preferential coupling for this method, and hence it is widely used to study receptor activation of mGluR2 receptors both in recombinant cell lines and in tissues (Schaffhauser et al 2003, Pinkerton et al, 2004, Mutel et al (1998) Journal of Neurochemistry. 71:2558-64; Schaffhauser et al (1998) Molecular Pharmacology 53:228-33). Here we describe the use of the [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP\u03b3S binding assay using membranes from cells transfected with the human mGluR2 receptor and adapted from Schaffhauser et al ((2003) Molecular Pharmacology 4:798-810) for the detection of the positive allosteric modulation (PAM) properties of the compounds of this invention.</p>Membrane preparationCHO-cells were cultured to pre-confluence and stimulated with 5 mM butyrate for 24 hours, prior to washing in PBS, and then collection by scraping in homogenisation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 4\u00b0C). Cell lysates were homogenized briefly (15s) using an ultra-turrax homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 23 500 x g for 10 minutes and the supernatant discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 and centrifuged again (30 000 x g, 20 min, 4\u00b0C). The final pellet was resuspended in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 and stored at -80\u00b0C in appropriate aliquots before use. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad, USA) with bovine serum albumin as standard.</p>[<sup>35</sup>S]GTP\u03b3S binding assayMeasurement of mGluR2 positive allosteric modulators in membranes containing human mGluR2 was performed using frozen membranes that were thawed and briefly homogenised prior to pre-incubation in 96-well microplates (15 \u00b5g/assay well, 30 minutes, 30\u00b0C) in assay buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 50 \u00b5M GDP, 10 \u00b5g/ml saponin,) with increasing concentrations of positive allosteric modulator (from 0.3 nM to 50 \u00b5M) and either a minima"
