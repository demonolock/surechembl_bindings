    "e present invention, the compound comprising a sequence (N)<sub>x</sub> which is substantially complementary to the sequence of a target nucleic acid.</p>\"Having complementarity\" or \"substantially complementary\" refers to complementarity of greater than about 84%, to another sequence. For example in a duplex region consisting of 19 base pairs one mismatch results in 94.7% complementarity, two mismatches results in about 89.5% complementarity and 3 mismatches results in about 84.2% complementarity, rendering the duplex region substantially complementary. Accordingly substantially identical refers to identity of greater than about 84%, to another sequence.</p>Additionally, the invention provides a method of inhibiting the expression of the target genes of the present invention by at least 40%, preferably by 50%, 60% or 70%, more preferably by 75%, 80% or 90% as compared to a control comprising contacting an mRNA transcript of the target gene of the present invention with one or more of the compounds of the invention.</p>In one embodiment the oligoribonucleotide is inhibiting one or more of the target genes of the present invention, whereby the inhibition is selected from the group comprising inhibition of gene function, inhibition of polypeptide and inhibition of mRNA expression.</p>In one embodiment the compound inhibits the target polypeptide, whereby the inhibition is selected from the group comprising inhibition of function (which may be examined by an enzymatic assay or a binding assay with a known interactor of the native gene / polypeptide, inter alia), inhibition of protein (which may be examined by Western blotting, ELISA or immuno-precipitation, inter alia) and inhibition of mRNA expression (which may be examined by Northern blotting, quantitative RT-PCR, in-situ hybridisation or microarray hybridisation, inter alia).</p>Additionally, the invention provides a method of treating or preventing kidney damage in a subject at risk of CKD associated with activation or upregulation or overexpression of one or more of the target genes of the present invention, the method comprising administering to the subject a compound of the invention in a therapeutically effective dose thereby treating or preventing kidney damage in the subject.</p>In additional embodiments the invention provides a method of treating a subject at risk of developing CKD accompanied by or associated with or resulting from an elevated level of one or more of the target genes of the present invention, the method comprising administering to the subject a compound of the invention in a therapeutically effective dose thereby reducing the risk of developing CKD in the subject.</p>DeliveryThe siRNA compound useful in methods of the invention is administered as the compound per se (i.e. as naked siRNA) or as pharmaceutically acceptable salt and is administered alone or as an active ingredient in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, solvent, diluent, excipie"
