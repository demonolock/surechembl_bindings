    "SDS-PAGE analysis of the samples (Biorad). A batch of 4\u00d7 concentrated loading dye, with or without reducing agent DTT, was prepared and aliquoted to \u221220\u00b0 C. Routinely, 5 \u03bcl was taken from the intermediate dilution at 1 mg/ml and then, 5 \u03bcl of 4\u00d7 concentrated loading dye (+/\u2212DDT) was added together with 10 \u03bcl of mQ. The final quantity for each condition was 5 \u03bcg. Samples were boiled for 10 min at 95\u00b0 C. and then loaded (20 \u03bcl) to the pre-cast gels. Electrophoresis took place for 35 min in a tris-glycine buffer system under a constant voltage of 200 V. Blue staining (Gentaur) followed for 1 h. All gels were de-stained with mQ water for at least 1 h.</p>Determination of % Full Length AbThe intensity of the different bands was determined on the Odyssey v3.0 Li-Cor system by scanning the protein gels to one-channel detection (700 nm) under the settings: focus offset 0.5 mm and \u201chigh\u201d quality. The brightness and contrast for each analysis were set to 50% with a linear manual parameter of 5.</p>The method was as follows:\nScan the gel and verify that all bands on gel are surrounded by tight rectanglesChoose \u201cexport\u201d in the settings in order to obtain the raw intensity of all bands in an Excel formatCalculate the % raw intensity of each band present in a lane as the raw intensity of the band divided by the total raw intensity of the lane and multiply by 100For the non-reducing conditions, the % full length Ab is defined as the % raw intensity of the band which corresponds to the \u02dc100 kD bandFor the reducing conditions, the % full length Ab is defined as the summary of the raw intensity of the bands which correspond to the \u02dc25-35 kD and \u02dc55 kD bands\n</p>Protocol for Target Binding Activity Measurement in Biacore 3000Sample PreparationFrom the intermediate concentration of all samples at 1 mg/ml described above, an extra 1/250 dilution was done for SPR analysis to yield a final concentration of 4 \u03bcg/ml. This 1/250 dilution took place for all conditions in two steps: a) 5 \u03bcl (1 mg/ml)+120 \u03bcl HBS-EP (SPR buffer) and b) an extra 10\u00d7 dilution (15 \u03bcl+135 \u03bcl HBS-EP). For each antibody and each time point, a separate standard curve was prepared, starting from a \u221280\u00b0 C. frozen sample. This was analyzed together with the stability samples to determine the slope of each curve after general fitting of the standards. These slopes were used to calculate the percent activity of the stability samples by setting the reference sample at 100%.</p>Determination of % Activity on BiacoreTo determine the target binding activity in Biacore, a CM5 chip was coated with \u02dc4000 RU human GARP-TGF-\u03b2 complex. Flow was set to 30 \u03bcl/min with a \u201ckinject\u201d injection mode and two regeneration injections (1 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM glycine pH 1.5) with a 5 min interval.</p>The method was carried out as follows:\nOpen the curves in the BIAEVAL program and select value \u20182-1\u2019 (1: blank, 2 hGARP-TGF-\u03b21)Select one curve at the time for plot overlayDelete the regeneration part of the curveSelect the baseline just before the injection and transform the Y-axis for \u2018zero at median of selection\u2019Select \u2018General Fit\u2019, starting from 120 sec after injecting and ending at 15",
