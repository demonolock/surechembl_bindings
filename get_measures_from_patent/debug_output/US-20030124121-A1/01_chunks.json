    "ration and autoantibody production. Patients with the syndrome reportedly have an inherited deficiency in apoptosis. IL-4 antagonists may benefit patients with this syndrome by suppressing a TH2-type immune response, or by binding (and inactivating) excess IL-4 at sites of inflammation. Methods for treating such patients in accordance with the present invention are not limited by a particular mechanism of action, however. </p>[0075] Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia </p>[0076] Excessive IL-4 secretion, and a deficiency in TH1-type cytokines, are implicated in contributing to the pathogenesis of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. IL-4 antagonists are administered in accordance with the present invention, to benefit the patients by reducing autoantibody production, and by restoring a more normal balance between the TH1 and TH2 components of the immune response. </p>[0077] Autoimmune Uveitis </p>[0078] Uveitis involves inflammation of the uvea (generally considered to include the iris, ciliary body, and choroid, considered together). Excess IL-4 secretion is implicated as playing a role in pathogenesis of this sight-threatening inflammatory eye disease. In accordance with the present invention, IL-4 antagonist(s) are administered to a uveitis patient to reduce disease severity. In one embodiment, IL-4 antagonist(s) are administered to an individual who has autoimmune uveoretinitis. </p>[0079] Kawasaki Disease </p>[0080] Also known as the mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome, Kawasaki disease (KD) mainly afflicts young children. The disease is characterized by particular changes in the mucus membranes lining the lips and mouth, and by enlarged, tender lymph glands. Symptoms typically include fever, conjunctivitis, inflammation of the lips and mucous membranes of the mouth, swollen glands in the neck, and a rash covering the hands and feet, leading to hardened, swollen and peeling skin on hands and feet. In children with Kawasaki Disease (KD), inflammation of arteries (vasculitis) may develop. Due to the effect of the disease on the vascular system, KD reportedly is the main cause of acquired heart disease in children. </p>[0081] IL-4 antagonists may be administered to patients with Kawasaki Disease, to reduce the elevated levels of IL-4 in the patient. Excessive IL-4 secretion and a deficiency in TH1-type cytokines contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. </p>[0082] Barreft's Esophagus </p>[0083] Barrett's esophagus is a condition characterized by alteration (subsequent to irritation) of the cells in the epithelial tissue that lines the lower portion of the esophagus. Frequent reflux of the stomach contents into the esophagus, over time, can lead to Barrett esophagus. Patients with Barrett esophagus are at risk for developing esophageal cancer (e.g., adenocarcinoma). While not wishing to be bound by a particular mechanism of action, administration of an IL-4 antagonist may benefit a patient with Barrett's esophagus by suppressing a TH2-type immune response. In one embodiment, an IL-4 antagonist is administered to a patient with esophagitis, to inhibit progression to Barrett's esophagus. </p>[0084] Nephrosis </p>[0085] Nephrosis, also known as nephrotic syndrome, is kidney disease that is non-inflammatory and non-malignant. In the condition known as minimal change nephrosis, glomerular damage (believed to arise from structural changes in glomerular visceral epithelial cells) results in abnormalities that include proteinuria. A TH2-type immune response (especially secretion of the TH2-type cytokines IL-4 and IL-13) ",
    "utants/muteins, and other variants of IL-4 that function as IL-4 antagonists may be employed. Peptides (which may or may not be muteins) derived from IL-4 that bind to an IL-4R without inducing transduction of a biological signal find use herein. Such peptides function as inert blockers, interfering with the binding of biologically active endogenous IL-4 to cell surface receptors. IL-4-induced signal transduction thereby is inhibited. Muteins or other antagonists that induce a biological response at a reduced level or to a lesser degree, compared to the response induced by native IL-4, also find use as IL-4 antagonists. </p>[0202] Further examples of IL-4 antagonists, including IL-4 muteins, and procedures for preparation thereof are described in Muller et al., J. Mol. Biol., 237:423-436, 1994; U.S. Pat. No. 6,028,176, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,723,118, which are each incorporated by reference herein. </p>[0203] Other options are antisense molecules (oligonucleotides) that inhibit expression of IL-4. Alternatively, the antisense molecule may suppress expression of other molecules involved in IL-4-induced signal transduction. </p>[0204] Any suitable assay, including in vitro assays, can be utilized to determine whether a given compound inhibits an IL-4-induced biological activity. An antagonist may be assayed for the ability to inhibit <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine incorporation in cells that normally proliferate in response to IL-4. </p>[0205] An alternative involves use of conventional binding assay techniques to test an antagonist for the ability to inhibit binding of IL-4 to cells expressing native or recombinant IL-4 receptors. For use in such assays, recombinant human IL-4 can be expressed and purified as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,017,691, hereby incorporated by reference herein, or in Park et al., J. Exp. Med. 166:476 (1987). The purified protein may be labeled with a detectable agent (e.g., radiolabeled) by any of a number of conventional techniques. A commercially available enzymobead radioiodination reagent (BioRad) may be employed in radiolabeling IL-4 with <sup>125</sup>I for example. </p>[0206] The ability of an IL-4 antagonist to inhibit IL-4-induced damage to epithelium, such as lung epithelium or intestinal epithelium (which may result in loss of barrier function), may be confirmed in any of a number of suitable assays. Among the suitable assay techniques are those described in example 7 below. </p>[0207] Therapeutic Methods and Administration of Antagonists </p>[0208] Methods provided herein comprise administering an IL-4 antagonist to a patient, thereby reducing an IL-4-induced biological response that plays a role in a particular condition. In particular embodiments, methods of the invention involve contacting endogenous IL-4 with an IL-4 antagonist, e.g., in an ex vivo procedure. </p>[0209] Treatment encompasses alleviation of at least one symptom of a disorder, or reduction of disease severity, and the like. An antagonist need not effe",
    "ubated at room temperature for 30 min with test antibodies at the final concentrations indicated. Recombinant human IL-4 or IL-13 was then added to the cultures at the concentrations indicated, and cells were cultured for 20-24 hours at 37\u00b0 C. in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. At the end of the culture period, cells were washed once in PBS+0.02% NaN<sub>3 </sub>in the 96-well culture plate and were resuspended in blocking buffer (2% normal rabbit serum +1% normal goat serum in PBS +NaN<sub>3</sub>). Phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated CD23 monoclonal antibody (mAb) or PE-conjugated isotype control mAb (both from Pharmingen) was then added to cells at a final dilution of 1:10. Cells were incubated for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0 C., washed \u00d73 in PBS +NaN<sub>3 </sub>and analyzed on a FacScan (Becton Dickinson) for CD23 expression. </p>[0280] In all experiments, negative controls were included which consisted of cells cultured with hybridoma growth medium or isotype-matched non-blocking human anti-hIL-4R antibody. An anti-huIL-4R murine mAb (R&amp;D Systems), previously shown to block the binding and function of both hIL-4 and hIL-13, was used as a positive control for neutralization of CD23 induction by IL-4 and IL-13. </p>EXAMPLE 6 Hybridoma Cell Line [0281] One hybridoma cell line generated by procedures described above (see example 4) is designated 6-2. The anti-IL-4R monoclonal antibody secreted by this hybridoma is a blocking antibody, as determined in a conventional plate binding assay, and thus functions as an IL-4 antagonist. The monoclonal antibody produced by 6-2 also exhibits the ability to reduce an IL-13-induced biological activity. </p>[0282] One embodiment of the invention is directed to a hybridoma cell line produced as described above, wherein the hybridoma secretes an isotype IgM MAb directed against human IL-4R. Also provided herein are IgG1 monoclonal antibodies derived from IgM monoclonal antibodies. </p>[0283] The DNA sequence of the variable region of the light chain of MAb 6-2 has been determined, and is presented in SEQ ID NO:5; the amino acid sequence encoded thereby is presented in SEQ ID NO:6. Complementarity determining regions 1 to 3 (CDR 1-3) are believed to correspond to amino acids 24-35, 51-57, and 90-97, of SEQ ID NO:6, respectively. </p>[0284] The DNA sequence of the variable region of the heavy chain of MAb 6-2 has been determined, and is presented in SEQ ID NO:7; the amino acid sequence encoded thereby is presented in SEQ ID NO:8. Complementarity determining regions 1 to 3 (CDR 1-3) are believed to correspond to amino acids 31-35, 50-66, and 99-107 of SEQ ID NO:8, respectively. </p>EXAMPLE 7 Assays for Measuring Loss of Barrier Function [0285] A method provided herein involves use of IL-4 antagonists to inhibit IL-4-induced damage to epithelium, including but not limited to lung epithelium or intestinal epithelium. Damage to epithelium can result in loss of barrier function. A number of techniques are known for "
