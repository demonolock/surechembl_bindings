It is believed that the azetidinyl-group improved selectivity for A\u03b242 and can be used to reduce the ratio A\u03b2 42/40 peptides. The compounds are expected to have improved blood-brain passage and thus an improved pharmacokinetic and dynamic profile, such as a faster onset of action and reduced side effects. This is especially true for the compounds, wherein R<sup>2 </sup>is the more hydrophilic alcohol-substituent.</p>In one embodiment of the invention, A is a 5- or 6-membered heteroaryl ring selected from the group consisting of pyridinyl, pyridazinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl, triazinyl, imidazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, pyrryl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, pyrazolyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl and thiadiazolyl, wherein the ring is optionally substituted with one C<sub>1-3</sub>-alkyl substituent.</p>In another embodiment, A is selected from the group consisting of pyridinyl, pyridazinyl, pyrimidinyl, imidazolyl, thiazolyl, oxazolyl, pyrazolyl and triazolyl, and is substituted with one methyl substituent.</p>In yet another embodiment, A is imidazolyl substituted with methyl. In yet another embodiment, A is 4-methyl-1H-imidazol-1-yl.</p>In one embodiment, R<sup>1 </sup>is hydrogen, methoxy or cyano. In another embodiment, R<sup>1 </sup>is methoxy.</p>In one embodiment, R<sup>2 </sup>is C<sub>1-6</sub>-alkyl, which is optionally substituted with one or more substituents independently selected from the group consisting of hydroxy, halo and cyano.</p>In another embodiment, R<s"
