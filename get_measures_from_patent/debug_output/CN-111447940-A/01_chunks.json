    "dies isolated from cultures comprising such hybridoma cells.</p>In certain preferred embodiments, the antibodies of the invention are monoclonal antibodies, and in certain embodiments, the invention provides methods for producing novel antibodies. For example, a method for producing a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds a CPR-4 or CTSB protein or polypeptide can comprise administering to a mouse an amount of an immunogenic composition comprising a CPR-4 or CTSB protein or polypeptide effective to stimulate a detectable immune response, obtaining an antibody-producing cell (e.g., a cell from the spleen) from the mouse and fusing the antibody-producing cell with a myeloma cell to obtain an antibody-producing hybridoma, and testing the antibody-producing hybridoma to identify a hybridoma that produces a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the CPR-4 or CTSB protein or polypeptide. Once the hybridoma is obtained, it may be propagated in cell culture, optionally under culture conditions in which the hybridoma-derived cells produce monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to the CPR-4 or CTSB proteins or polypeptides. Monoclonal antibodies can be purified from cell cultures. Influence on antibodies: one characteristic of the specificity of an antigen interaction is the affinity of the antibody for the antigen. Although the desired specificity can be achieved by a range of different affinities, it is generally preferred that the antibody will have an affinity (dissociation constant) of about 10-6, 10-7, 10-8, 10-9 or less.</p>In some embodiments, the agent may be a nucleic acid molecule. In certain aspects, the nucleic acid molecule can be an RNAi, ribozyme, antisense, dnase, or other nucleic acid-related composition for manipulating (typically reducing) target expression or activity. This may include altering the expression of targets such as CPR-4, CTSB or any other target molecule, alone or in combination. (it should be noted that while preferred embodiments may use CPR-4 or CTSB as exemplary models, this is not a limitation on the number of target molecules that make up the present invention.) some embodiments of the present invention utilize materials and methods for affecting target genes, such as CPR-4 and/or CTSB genes, through RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi is a process of sequence-specific post-transcriptional gene repression that occurs in eukaryotic cells. Typically, this process involves mRNA degradation of a particular sequence induced by double-stranded rna (dsrna) homologous to the sequence. Any selected gene can be inhibited by introducing dsRNA corresponding to all or most of the mRNA of that gene. It appears that when a long dsRNA is expressed, it is initially processed by ribonuclease III into shorter dsRNA oligonucleotides as short as 21 to 22 base pairs in length.</p>Thus, RNAi can be achieved by introducing or expressing relatively short homologous dsRNA. The double-stranded oligonucleotide used to affect RNAi",

UV-CM can also reduce germ cell death in ced-1(e1735) animals with many none in a UV dose dependent manner (FIG. 1b)Phagocytic apoptotic cells at 100J/m<sup>2</sup>Maximal death suppressing activity was achieved. These results are consistent with published reports that decreased apoptosis or increased survival of unexposed cells is one of the endpoints of RIBEs.</p>Example 2 this example illustrates the identification of RIBE factors as proteins produced by irradiated cells, rather than as proteinsOther factors.</p>The present inventors explored the properties of RIBE factors by treating UV-CM with enzymes that disrupt DNA, RNA, or proteins. The apoptosis inhibitory activity in UV-CM was resistant to DNase or RNase treatment (fig. 6a, b), but inhibited by trypsin (fig. 1c), indicating that rib factor is a protein. UV-CM collected from either cell death-deficient ced-3(N2433) animals, germ line deficient glp-1(e2141) animals or N2 animals fed with dead bacteria retained death inhibitory activity (FIGS. 6c-f), indicating that the RIBE factor is unlikely to be a factor produced by bacterial or radiation-induced cell death byproducts and can be constructed without germ line.</p>Using a 10kD molecular weight cut-off filter unit, the inventors split the UV-CM into two parts, one part containing proteins that may be greater than 10kD and the other part containing proteins that are less than 10 kD. RIBE activity appeared as a fraction &gt;10kD (FIG. 7a) and separated on SDS polyacrylamide gels (FIG. 1 d). The protein bands characteristic of UV-CM were analyzed by mass spectrometry, from which 19 proteins were identified (FIG. 1 e; FIG. 8 and Table 5).</p>Example 3 this example illustrates the identification of CPR-4 as a factor RIBE.</p>The present inventors used RNA interference (RNAi) to examine whether one of the 19 genes was responsible for RIBE. UV-CM from the cpr-4RNAi treated animals showed greatly reduced RIBE activity, while UV-CM from other gene RNAi treated animals retained RIBE activity (FIG. 7b). cpr-4 encodes a homolog of a mammalian cathepsin B lysosomal protease, secreted as an extracellular protease. Because the deletion mutation in CPR-4(tm3718) removed one third of the CPR-4 protein (FIG. 9a), abolished RIBE activity, a single copy integration transgene (Pcpr-4:: CPR-4:: Flag) carrying a CPR-4 genomic fragment with a carboxy-terminal Flag tag reduced RIBE to the CPR-4(tm3718) animal (FIG. 2a), which requires CPR-4 for RIBE activity in UV-CM.</p>Example 4 this example illustrates the secretion of CPR-4 and the induction of CPR-4 by a cep-1 dependent mechanismMediated RIBEs.</p>The present inventors investigated whether CPR-4 is secreted into the culture medium under ultraviolet irradiation. In the Pcpr-4:: CPR-4:: Flag animals, CPR-4:: Flag was detected in UV-CM but not in UV-Ctrl (FIG. 1 f). CPR-4:: immunodepletion of UV-CM from Cp-4:: CPR-4:: fla",
