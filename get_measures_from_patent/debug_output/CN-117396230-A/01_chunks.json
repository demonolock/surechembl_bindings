    "in refers to a specific atom or group of amino acids on an antigen to which an antibody binds. Two antibodies or antigen binding fragments may bind to the same epitope within an antigen if they exhibit competitive binding to the antigen.</p><p id=\"p0109\" num=\"0104\">As used herein, the terms \"specifically bind,\" \"specifically recognizes,\" and \"specific for \u2026 \u2026\" refer to measurable and reproducible interactions, such as binding between a target and a targeting moiety (e.g., a targeting peptide or antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof). In certain embodiments, specific binding determines the presence of a target in the presence of a heterogeneous population of molecules, including biomolecules (e.g., cell surface receptors). For example, a targeting moiety that specifically recognizes a target (which may be an epitope) is one that has greater affinity, avidity, than its binding to other molecules Antibodies that bind this target more easily and/or for a longer duration. In some embodiments, the extent of binding of the targeting moiety to an unrelated molecule is less than about 10% of the binding of the targeting moiety to the target, as measured, for example, by a Radioimmunoassay (RIA). In some embodiments, the targeting moiety that specifically binds to the target has a value of 10 or less <sup>-5</sup> M\u3001\u226410 <sup>-6</sup> M\u3001\u226410 <sup>-7</sup> M\u3001\u226410 <sup>-8</sup> M\u3001\u226410 <sup>-9</sup> M\u3001\u226410 <sup>-10</sup> M\u3001\u226410 <sup>-11</sup> M or less than or equal to 10 <sup>-12</sup> Dissociation constant (KD) of M. In some embodiments, the targeting moiety specifically binds to an epitope on a protein that is conserved among proteins from different species. In some embodiments, specific binding may include, but is not required to, exclusive binding. The binding specificity of the targeting moiety can be determined experimentally by methods known in the art. Such methods include, but are not limited to, western blotting, ELISA, RIA, ECL, IRMA, EIA, BIACORETM, and peptide scanning.</p><p id=\"p0110\" num=\"0105\">As used herein, the term \"targeting moiety binding fragment\" or \"TBF\" refers to a fragment comprising a targeting moiety binding peptide (\"TBP\") that specifically binds to a targeting moiety. The TBF may also comprise a chemically reactive moiety that may be covalently linked to a targeting moiety. In some embodiments, the TBF comprises a small molecule linker comprising a chemically reactive moiety. In some embodiments, the TBF does not comprise a chemically reactive moiety that can be covalently linked to the targeting moiety, i.e., the TBF is non-covalently bound to the targeting moiety. In some embodiments, the targeting moiety binding peptide is an antibody binding peptide (\"ABP\"), which is a polypeptide that specifically binds to an antibody. Exemplary ABPs include, but are not limited to, fcBP-1, fcBP-2, fc-III, and fragments thereof. As used herein, a TBF comprising ABP is referred to herein as an \"antibody binding fragment\" or \"ABF. </p><p id=\"p0111\" num=\"0106\">As ",

Thus, immune checkpoint inhibitors include antagonists of CTLA-4, PD-1, PD-L2, LAG3, B7-1, B7-H3, B7-H4, BTLA, VISTA, KIR, A2aR and TIM 3. For example, antibodies that bind to and antagonize the function of CTLA-4, PD-1, PD-L2, LAG3, B7-1, B7-H3, B7-H4, BTLA, VISTA, KIR, A aR or TIM3 are immune checkpoint inhibitors. </p><p id=\"p0175\" num=\"0170\">In some embodiments, the targeting moiety comprises an antibody or antigen binding fragment that specifically binds to an immune checkpoint molecule.
