    "dilutions that contains every kind of medicine.MIC is defined as to the minimum concentration that suppresses the medicine of visible growth fully at 37 \u2103 after incubation 18h.All MIC determine and repeat in independent experiment at least 3 times.</p>The MIC of microbiotic \u00b1 synergy compound determines</p>The MIC of paraxin \u00b1 test compound (MIC/4) determines by micro-meat soup dilution process (9).All MIC determine in independent experiment at least triplicate.The MIC ratio is corresponding to the ratio that exists (at MIC/4) lower independent antibiotic MIC to identical antibiotic MIC in test compounds.Carry out two groups of experiments:</p>The compound 1-11 of the 1st Zu of \u2013 table 1 of \u25a0 is at 4 bacterial strains, and enteroaerogen MDR Ea289 and homogenic acrAB mutant (1) thereof, measure on Salmonella typhimurtum MDR BN10055 and homogenic acrAB mutant (11) thereof.They are analyzed at the synergistic activity of MIC/4 and three kinds of microbiotic (paraxin, erythromycin and Nalidixic Acid)</p>Compound 1-40 shown in the 2nd Zu of \u2013 table 1 of \u25a0 is testing on identical bacterial strain and to measure measuring their at rain synergistic activity of paraxin, Vibravenos (doxocycline) and Nalidixic Acid of MIC/4 with first group.</p>The toxicity of compound:</p>The toxicity of every kind of compound is determined on the CHO culturing cell.The incubation of Chinese hamster ovary celI is undertaken by the serial dilutions of compound.Compound dissolution is in DMSO or PBS.The IC50 of following compound is presented in table 2.IC50 is corresponding to the concentration of the compound that causes killing after 24 hours at incubation 50% Chinese hamster ovary celI.</p>result</p>The toxicity of compound</p>According to the IC50 of compounds more of the present invention, be presented in table 2.The IC50 of the majority of compounds shown in table 1 is higher than 100 \u03bc M.Notably, the compound of the table 1 of n=1 shows the IC50 higher than the compound of n=2.</p>The intrinsic activity of compound:</p>The minimum inhibition concentration of every kind of compound (MIC) definite is the precondition of further analyzing they and antibiotic cooperative behavior under the concentration lower than their intrinsic activities.According to the homogeny of compound and bacterial strain, MIC shows greatly variation.</p>The synergistic activity of compound and paraxin:</p>Compound listed in his-and-hers watches 2 is tested the ability that they reduce the paraxin MIC of Ea289 (a kind of enteroaerogen MDR bacterial strain (1)).At first every kind of compound is tested under MIC/4.As the MIC of paraxin, when reaching the value that surpasses 8, the concentration of compound further reduces to reach the value of the MIC ratio that causes 8.All MIC determine and repeat in independent experiment at least 3 times.Result shows compound 5,7, and 8,9,10 and 11 show and reaching 8 MIC than the strong activity under similar or lower effective concentration with PA \u03b2 N.In addition, compound 8,9,10 and 11 show the low approximately effective concentration of 4.9 times than contrast PA \u03b2 N.In addition, these compounds to the IC50 of Chinese hamster ovary celI the effective concentration far above them.Observe higher difference 10 times at compound, its IC50 is than its effective concentration higher approximately 300 times (table 2).</p></p>Compound and paraxin, Macrolide, the synergistic activity of quinolones and tetracyclines:</p>The 1st group of experiment of \u25a0</p>Compound is at 4 kinds of bacterial strains, and enteroaerogen MDR Ea289 and homogenic acrAB mutant (1) thereof, Salmonella typhimurtum MDR BN10055 and homogenic acrAB mutant (11) thereof are upper measures.They are analyzed to (table 3) with the synergistic activity of microbiotic (paraxin, erythromycin and Nalidixic Acid) under MIC/4.</p>Except compound 1, every kind of compound associating paraxin (Chl), erythromycin (Ery) or Nalidixic Acid (Nal) are observed to significant MIC ratio on 4 kinds of tested bacterial strains.Than their homogenic acrAB mutant, obtain higher MIC ratio on two kinds of MDR bacterial strains, show our the potent rate of compound on efflux pump AcrAB-TolC.There are 6 kinds of compounds (compound 5,7,8,9,10, and 11) at least two kinds of microbiotic to be obtained &gt;=16 MIC ratio on two kinds of MDR bacterial strains.In addition, compound 8 and 9 pairs of three kinds of microbiotic testing obtain &gt;=16 MIC ratio on Ea289.Similarly, compound 5 and 9 obtains &gt;=16 MIC ratio to three kinds of tested microbiotic on bacterial strain BN10005.Put together, these results confirm that multiple compounds shows synergistic activity with microbiotic on Gram-negative MDR bacterial strain, and compound 9 is one of tested maximum activity com"
