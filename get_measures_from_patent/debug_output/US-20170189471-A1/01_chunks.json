Scale bars, 50 \u03bcm. In FIG. 2D pancreatic leukocytes were isolated from control and CP mice and analysed using flow cytometry for macrophage numbers, BrdU incorporation, Ki-67 expression (n&gt;3 per group). In FIG. 2E CCR2<sup>WT</sup>CD45.1<sup>+ </sup>CD45.2<sup>+ </sup>C57BL/6 mice were lethally irradiated and reconstituted with a 1:1 mixture of BM cells from CCR2<sup>WT</sup>CD45.1<sup>+</sup> and CCR2<sup>KO</sup>CD45.2<sup>+ </sup>mice over 8 weeks. Mice were injected with caerulein to induce CP as described herein, and macrophages (gated on CD11b<sup>+ </sup>F4/80<sup>+</sup> without prior CD45.2 gating) were analysed using flow cytometry following pancreatic leukocyte isolation. Representative flow cytometry plots and bar graphs depicting the proportion of macrophages and BrdU incorporation originating from CCR2<sup>WT</sup>CD45.1<sup>+ </sup>(black line) versus from CCR2<sup>KO</sup>CD45.2<sup>+</sup> (grey line) and CCR2 expression are shown. n=3 for each group; mean\u00b1s.e.m., ns, not significant (unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test).</p>FIG. 3A to FIG. 3D depict, in accordance with various embodiments of the present invention, that alternatively activated macrophages are dominant in mouse and human CP. In FIG. 3A pancreatic leukocytes from control and CP mice were isolated and sorted for SSC-A<sup>low</sup>CD11b<sup>+ </sup>monocytes/macrophages (five mice were pooled for each group). Markers of alternatively and classically activated macrophages were assessed using quantitative PCR. Expression of the genes was normalized to their relative expression in control mice.

Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test bioassays or systems.</p>An effective amount as used herein would also include an amount sufficient to delay the development of a symptom of the disease, alter the course of a symptom of disease (for example but not limited to, slow the progression of a symptom of the disease), or reverse a symptom of disease. Thus, it is not possible to specify the exact \u201ceffective amount\u201d. However, for any given case, an appropriate \u201ceffective amount\u201d can be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using only routine experimentation.</p>Effective amounts, toxicity, and therapeutic efficacy can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dosage can vary depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compositions and methods that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. A therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. Also, a dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the agent for inhibiting IL-4/IL-13 receptor function, which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture, or in an appropriate animal model. Levels in plasma can be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography. The effects of any particular dosage can be monitored by a suitable bioassay. The dosage can be determined by a physician and adjusted, as necessary, to suit observed effects of the treatment.</p>The phrase \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d refers to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. The phrase \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable carrier\u201d or \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable excipient\u201d as used herein means a pharmaceutically acceptable material, composition or vehicle, such as a liquid or solid filler, diluent, excipient, solvent, media, encapsulating material, manufacturing aid (e.g., lubricant, talc magnesium, calcium or zinc stearate, or steric acid), or solvent encapsulating material, involved in maintaining the stability, solubility, or activity of, an inhibitor of IL-4/IL-13 receptor. Each carrier must be \u201cacceptable\u201d in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and",

For surface staining, murine cells were stained with the following antibodies: APC-CD45.2 (109814, 1:200), PE/Cy7-CD4 (100528, 1:300), Percp/Cy5.5-CD11b (101228, 1:200), BV421-F4/80 (123137, 1:200), APC/Cy7-CD11C (117324, 1:200), PE-IL-411.a (144803 1:100), AF488-CD206 (141710, 1:100), AF700-MHCII (107622, 1:300), PB-Ly6C (128014, 1:200), PE/Cy7-Ly-6G (127617, 1:300), PE-Fc\u03b5RI\u03b1 (134307, 1:200), AF488-ckit (105815, 1:200), APC-eFluor780-CD45.1 (47-0453-82, eBioscience, 1:200) and PE-Siglec-F (562068, BD Biosciences, 1:200). Human cells were stained with PE/Cy7-CD14 (301814, 1:100), AF488-CD206 (321114, 1:50) and APC-CD68 (333810, 1:100). For intracellular cytokine staining, cells were activated with phorbol myristate acetate (50 ng ml<sup>\u22121</sup>) and ionomycin (1 \u03bcg ml<sup>\u22121</sup>), in the presence of brefeldin A (10 \u03bcg ml<sup>\u22121</sup>, eBioscience) for 4 h at 37\u00b0 C. before staining. The cells were then fixed and permeabilized using the eBioscience kit following the manufacturer's guidelines. APC-IL10 (554468, 1:100) and isotype control (556924, 1:100) from BD Biosciences were used for intracellular staining. For intracellular TNF\u03b1 staining, cells were incubated with or without lipopolysaccharide (100 ngml-1, InvivoGen) in the presence of brefeldin A before surface-staining. PE-TNF\u03b1 (554419, 1:200) and isotype control (554685, 1:200) from BD Biosciences were used.</p>For detection of intracellular Ki-67 and BrdU, cells were stained for surface makers and then fixed and permeabilized using Foxp3 staining buffer set (eBioscience). For BrdU staining, cells were first incubated with DNase for 1 h at 37\u00b0 C. The Cells were then stained with PE-BrdU (339812, 1:100) or AF488-Ki67 (558616, BD Biosciences, 1:50). Dead cells were excluded from analysis using violet viability stain (Invitrogen). Flow cytometry data collection was performed on Fortessa LSRII (BD Biosciences) and analysed using the FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc.).</p>Cell Preparation and In Vitro Cultures:</p>Pancreatic leukocytes were isolated using collagenase digestion method described previously for flow cytometry analysis (Xue, J., et al. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor regulates pancreatic IL-22 production and protects mice from acute pancreatitis. Gastroenterology 143, 1670-1680 (2012)). PSCs from CP mice were isolated by outgrowth method as described (Bachem, M. G. et al. Identification, culture, and characterization of pancreatic stellate cells in rats and humans. Gastroenterology 115, 421-432 (1998)). Primary human PSCs from normal margins and PDAC were isolated using gradient centrifugation and outgrowth method, respectively (Bachem, M. G. et al. Identification, culture, and characterization of pancreatic stellate cells in rats and humans. Gastroenterology 115, 421-432 (1998); Apte, M. V. et al. Periacinar stellate shaped cells in rat pancreas: identification, isolation, and culture. Gut 43, 128-133 (1998)). M",
    "are known to be increased during acute inflammation, were downregulated in CP. Chronic repeated caerulein administration and pancreas harvest 3 days after the last injection is consistent with the development of a chronic and not AP. Furthermore, macrophage-associated cytokines and chemokines (granulocyte-macrophage CSF, granulocyte CSF, chemokine (C\u2014C motif) ligand (CCL)2/monocyte-specific chemokine(MCP)-1, CCL7/MCP-3 and CCL3/macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)1A) were upregulated, suggesting that monocytes/macrophages play an important role during CP. In contrast, no significant increase in CXCL1, a neutrophil chemoattractant with role in AP (Zhang, H. et al. J. Clin. Invest. 123, 1019-1031 (2013)), was observed (FIG. 2A).</p>To understand the relevance of these observations to human CP, we compared them with normal pancreas tissue sections. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that CD68<sup>+</sup> macrophages were increased in human CP (FIG. 2C). A similar trend was observed in mice; macrophage marker F4/80 analysis revealed that macrophages are abundant in CP as compared with the normal pancreas of mice (FIG. 2B). Furthermore, the number of pancreatic macrophages (CD11b<sup>+ </sup>F4/80<sup>+</sup>) analysed using flow cytometry was markedly increased in CP mice (FIG. 2D). Macrophage tissue infiltration occurs in two distinct ways: recruitment of monocyte precursors and proliferation of resident cells (Jenkins, S. J. et al. J. Exp. Med. 210, 2477-2491 (2013)). We used Ki-67 expression and 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation to determine the proportion of proliferating macrophages. We found that BrdU<sup>+</sup> and Ki-67<sup>+</sup> macrophages were both increased in CP mice accounting for \u02dc12-25% of the pancreatic macrophages (FIG. 2D), indicating proliferation of either resident macrophages or recruited monocytes that differentiated to macrophage contributed to some of the macrophage accumulation in CP.</p>During AP, monocytes are attracted to the injured pancreas before their differentiation into macrophages in a CCR2-dependent manner (Saeki, K. et al. Gastroenterology 142, 1010-1020 e1019 (2012); Serbina, N. V. &amp; Pamer, E. G. Nat. Immunol. 7, 311-317 (2006)). CCR2 ligands such as CCL2 (MCP-1) and CCL7 (MCP-3) are also elevated in CP (FIG. 2A). Considering that the model of CP is based on repetitive acute injury, we hypothesized that, in addition to proliferation, a significant proportion of macrophages in CP arises from monocyte recruitment. A competitive bone marrow (BM) chimera was set up by lethally irradiating recipient CCR2<sup>WT</sup>CD45.1<sup>+ </sup>CD45.2<sup>+ </sup>C57BL/6 mice and reconstituting them with a 1:1 mixture of BM derived from CCR2 wild-type (WT; CCR2<sup>WT </sup>CD45.1<sup>+</sup>) and CCR2 knockout (CCR2<sup>KO </sup>CD45.2<sup>+</sup>) mice so that macrophages derived from CCR2<sup>KO </sup>and CCR2<sup>WT </sup>mice could be distinguished from one another as well as from those of the recipient mice based on the allotypic CD45 markers. Following 8 weeks of engraftment and induction of CP, we found that the number of CCR2<sup>WT </sup>macrophages grea"
