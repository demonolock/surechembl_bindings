    "gen for immunization, aPC itself, or its partial peptides, can be used without modification, or after being conjugated with a carrier protein. When a carrier protein is used, for example, the antigen aPC is first coupled with the carrier protein (for example, thyroglobulin), and then an adjuvant is added thereto. Such adjuvants include Freund's complete and incomplete adjuvants and the like, any of which can be combined together.</p>An antigen prepared as described above is given to a mammal, such as a mouse, rat, hamster, guinea pig, horse, monkey, rabbit, goat, and sheep. This immunization can be performed by any existing method, including typically used intravenous injections, subcutaneous injections, and intraperitoneal injections. There are no restrictions as to the immunization intervals. Immunization may be carried out at intervals of several days to several weeks, preferably four to 21 days. A mouse can be immunized, for example, at a single dose of 10 to 100 \u00b5g (for example, 20 to 40 \u00b5g) of the antigen protein, but the dose is not limited to these values.</p>Before the first immunization, and three to seven days after the second and subsequent immunizations, blood is collected from the animals, and the sera are analyzed for antibody titer. To promote an immune response, an aggregating agent such as alum is preferably used. In general, selected mammalian antibodies have sufficiently high antigen binding affinity. Antibody affinity can be determined using a saturation binding assay, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or a competitive assay (for example, radioimmunoassay).</p>Polyclonal antibodies can be screened by a conventional crosslinking analysis, such as that described in \"Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, Harlow and David Lane edit. (1988))\". An alternative method is, for example, epitope mapping (Champe et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270:1388-1394 (1995)). A preferred method for determining polypeptide or antibody titers comprises quantifying antibody-binding affinity. In other embodiments, methods for assessing one or more biological properties of an antibody are also used in addition to or instead of the methods for determining antibody-binding affinity. Such analytical methods are particularly useful because they demonstrate the therapeutic effectiveness of antibodies. When an antibody exhibits an improved property in such analysis, its binding affinity is generally, but not always, enhanced.</p>Hybridomas which are used to prepare monoclonal antibodies can be obtained, for example, by the method of Milstein et al. (Kohler, G., and Milstein, C., Methods Enzymol. 1981, 73, 3-46). Myeloma cells to be fused with antibody-producing cells may be cell lines derived from any of the various animals, such as mice, rats, and humans, which are generally available to those skilled in the art. The cell lines to be used are drug-resistant, and cannot survive in a selective medium (e.g., HAT medium) in an unf"
