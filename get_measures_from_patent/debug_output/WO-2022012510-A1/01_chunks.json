The blood samples were placed on ice immediately after collection, and the plasma was centrifuged within 15 minutes (centrifugation conditions: 8000 rpm, 1 minute, room temperature). Collected plasma was stored at \u201320\u00b0C until analysis. The cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue were collected immediately after blood collection. Cerebrospinal fluid was extracted by dural puncture with a micro-injector under direct vision. After chloral hydrate anesthesia, the head was fixed, the back hair was cut off, and a transverse incision (2cm) was cut at the connection line between the two ears. The muscle layer of the neck and skull base was scraped open to expose the foramen magnum. With a 100 \u03bcl microinjector, about 100 \u03bcl of cerebrospinal fluid was taken and stored at \u201320\u00b0C before analysis.
