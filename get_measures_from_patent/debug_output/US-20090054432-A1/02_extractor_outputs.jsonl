{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nNone of the provided text snippet contains all four required components: a specific molecule name, ID or other identifier, a bioactivity metric (IC50, Ki, Kd, EC50 and their variations), a specific numeric value for that metric, and a unit for that value. However, I can suggest some sentences that contain some of the required components:\n\n\n* Mixtures of human Factor VIIa (typically supplied at 7 nM) and test compound (present at varying concentrations) in assay medium ... were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature.\n* Mixtures of human Factor Xa (typically supplied at 3 nM) (from Haematologic Technologies, Essex Junction, Vt., USA) and test compound (varying concentrations) in assay medium ... were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature.\n* Initial velocity measurements calculated from the progress curves by a kinetic analysis program (Batch Ki; BioKin, Ltd., Pullman, Wash.) were used to determine apparent inhibition constants (apparent K<sub>i</sub>'s).\n* Apparent inhibition constants (apparent K<sub>i</sub>'s) were calculated from the enzyme progress curves using standard mathematical models.\n\n\nPlease note that these sentences do not meet all the required criteria, but they contain some relevant information. If you would like me to extract more information or clarify any of these points, please let me know."}
