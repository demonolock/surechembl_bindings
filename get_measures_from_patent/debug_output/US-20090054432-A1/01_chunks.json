Next, reactions were initiated with the addition of substrate [500 \u03bcM of CH-<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>2</sub>-DCha-But-Arg-pNA (from Centerchem, Norwalk, Conn., USA)]. Hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate was followed spectrophotometrically at 405 nm for five minutes. Initial velocity measurements calculated from the progress curves by a kinetic analysis program (Batch Ki; BioKin, Ltd., Pullman, Wash.) were used to determine apparent inhibition constants (apparent K<sub>i</sub>'s).</p>Compounds of the invention tested by the above-described assay exhibited inhibition of Factor VIIa.</p>Example 2In Vitro Factor Xa Inhibitor AssayMixtures of human Factor Xa (typically supplied at 3 nM) (from Haematologic Technologies, Essex Junction, Vt., USA) and test compound (varying concentrations) in assay medium (comprising: Tris, 50 mM (pH 7.4); NaCl, 150 mM; CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM; Tween-20, 0.05%; EDTA, 1 mM; and dimethylsulfoxide, 10%) were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. Next, reactions were initiated with the addition of substrate [500 \u03bcM of CH-<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>-D-Cha-Gly-Arg-pNA (from Centerchem, Norwalk, Conn., USA]. Hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate was followed spectrophotometrically at (405 nm) for five minutes. Apparent inhibition constants (apparent K<sub>i</sub>'s) were calculated from the enzyme progress curves using standard mathematical models.</p>Compounds of the invention tested by the above-described assay exhibited inhibition of Factor Xa.</p>Example 3Pharmacokinetic AssayRats with pre-implanted jugular vein catheters, which were filled with heparin/saline/PVP lock prior to shipment, were bought from Charles River. Three rats were selected for each study, weighed, and injected with test compound by tail vein injection. Any residual test compound was retained and stored at \u221270\u00b0 C. for later analysis.</p>B"
