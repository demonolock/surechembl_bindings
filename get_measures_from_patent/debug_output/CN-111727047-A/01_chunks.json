    "iable regions comprise amino acid residues from \"complementarity determining regions\" or \"CDRs\".</p>As used herein, the term \"monoclonal antibody\" refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to conventional (polyclonal) antibody preparations, which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. The term \"monoclonal\" indicates that the antibody is characterized as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and should not be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, monoclonal antibodies can be made by hybridoma methods, or can be made by recombinant DNA methods. Monoclonal antibodies can also be isolated from phage antibody libraries.</p>As used herein, the term \"specifically binds\" or \"specifically binds\" refers to a non-random association between two molecules (i.e., an antibody and an antigen). According to some embodiments, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof is attached via its antigen-binding domain to&lt;10\"<sup>5</sup>The binding affinity (Kd) of M specifically binds to antigen. Alternatively, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof may be bound via its antigen-binding domain&lt;10\"<sup>6</sup>M or&lt;The Kd of 10\"M binds to the antigen. Kd, as used herein, refers to the ratio of the dissociation rate to the association rate (k)<sub>Dissociation</sub>/k<sub>Bonding of</sub>) And may be determined using any suitable method known in the art.</p>According to some embodiments, the inhibitor of the therapeutic combination is administered systemically. According to some embodiments, the inhibitor of the invention is formulated for systemic administration.</p>According to another embodiment, the systemic administration is via parenteral route. According to some embodiments, formulations of the inhibitors of the invention for parenteral administration include sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, suspensions or emulsions, each representing a separate embodiment of the invention.</p>According to some embodiments, the parenteral administration is intravenous, intraarterial, into a blood vessel wall, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intradermal, intravitreal, transdermal or subcutaneous administration. Each of the above routes of administration represents a separate embodiment of the present invention. According to some embodiments, the inhibitor of the therapeutic combination is administered intravenously.</p>According to some embodiments, systemic administration of the inhibitors of the invention is via injection. For administration via injection, the inhibitors of the invention may be formulated in aqueous solution, for example in physiologically compatible buffers, including but not limited to hank's solution, rin"
