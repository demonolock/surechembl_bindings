    " Each mutant \n\nidentified in this manner is designated by the letter \"M\" (for mutant) followed by bracketed information specifying the particular mutations present in the mutant. For example, M[R<sup>19</sup>\u2192A;R<sup>20</sup>\u2192A] denotes a mutant I<sub>i</sub> in which arginine at position 19 is replaced by alanine and arginine at position 20 is replaced by alainine. Other mutants specifically identified which exhibit an </p>endoprotease digestion pattern which differs from that of the wild type are: M[R<sup>78</sup>\u2192A;K<sup>80</sup>\u2192A;K<sup>83</sup>\u2192A;K<sup>86</sup>\u2192T]; </p>M[K<sup>137</sup>\u2192A;K<sup>143</sup>\u2192A]; M[R<sup>151</sup>\u2192A;K<sup>154</sup>\u2192A]; and M[L<sup>174</sup>\u2192V;F<sup>175</sup>\u2192A]. </p> Another aspect of the present invention relates to methods for identifying small organic compounds which bind selectively to an intermediate in the I<sub>i</sub> cleavage pathway. Such intermediates may, for example, mimic a rate-limiting step in the cleavage/release - peptide charging process. Small organic compounds as used herein are organic compounds, preferably less than 3,000 </p>molecular weight and most preferably less than 1,000 molecular weight which are derived by chemical synthesis or obtained as extracts from biological sources. </p> Libraries of such small organic compounds, organized on structural features, are maintained and routinely used for such screening purposes. </p> A preferred method for identifying such small organic compounds is to develop an inhibition binding assay using, for example, a T-cell presented peptide or homolog thereof. A T cell presented peptide is a peptide which has been demonstrated to contain a unique epitope recognized by a T-cell hybridoma in the context of a MHC class II molecule. These can be generated for example by protease digestion and isolation, or by chemical </p>synthesis. As used herein, a homolog of a T cell-presented peptide is defined as a peptide having amino acid substitutions, fragments of such peptides or a small organic compound which is thought to bear structural \n\nhomology to a segment of the T cell-presented peptide. Such an inhibition assay is carried out by combining the following components in vitro 1) an endoprotease digested first trimer complex comprising a mutant I<sub>i</sub> having an endoprotease digestion pattern which differs from that of wild type, and MHC class II \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains, 2) a small organic molecule to be tested for inhibition of T cell-presented peptide binding and 3) a T cell-presented peptide. In such an assay, if the binding of the T cell-presented peptide to the endoprotease digested trimer complex is blocked in the presence of the small organic compound, it can be concluded that the small organic compound is binding to an intermediate in the staged cleavage process. Indicator assays such as an ELISA assay can be used to identify compounds which block the binding of the indicator compound. Such an assay is carried out by linking to a solid support a purified",
    " for binding affinity to the T-cell presented peptide (or homolog thereof). The T-cell presented peptide (or homolog thereof) present in a solution is then incubated with the molecule linked to the solid support under conditions appropriate for binding. Such binding is determined through the </p>recognition of an indicator attached to the T cell-presented peptide or homolog thereof. </p> The selectivity of binding referred to above is defined relative to the binding of the small organic compound to a second trimer complex comprising wild type I<sub>i</sub>, MHC class II \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains; and a dimer comprising MHC class II \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains. Compounds which exhibit a binding affinity for endoprotease digested first trimer complex which is at least about 3-fold higher than the binding affinity for a second trimer complex comprising wild type I<sub>i</sub>, MHC class II \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains; and a dimer comprising MHC class II \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains meet the \n\nselectivity requirement of the present method. Binding affinity determinations can be made using a variety of well known techniques (e.g., ELISA). </p> The binding affinity determination is carried out separately for each of the following complexes: 1) protease digested first trimer complex, second trimer complex (containing wild type I<sub>i</sub>), and MHC class II \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains. Mutant I<sub>i</sub>-containing complexes which </p>demonstrate the required selectivity are identified. </p>Such mutants are then used in a similar inhibition binding assay. More specifically, in the case of an ELISA inhibition binding assay, the mutant complex is fixed to a solid support, followed by incubation with a selected small organic molecule. The concentrations of the small organic molecule would be determined </p>empirically. The goal of this screening step is to identify a small organic molecule which binds to the mutant I<sub>i</sub>-containing complex thereby inhibiting the binding of the T cell-presented peptide (or homolog thereof) to the mutant I<sub>i</sub>-containing complex. </p> Small organic compounds identified in the binding inhibition assay described above can be tested for immunomodulatory activity. A variety of assays (both in vivo and in vitro) which can be used for this purpose are known in the art. One example of such an assay involves the analysis of the modulation of presentation of an immunogenic peptide by an antigen presenting cell to a responder T lymphocyte. More specifically, a small organic compound to be tested for immunomodulatory activity is contacted with a cell culture comprising a known T-cell immunogenic peptide, its restricting antigen presenting cell, and T cells responding specifically to the immunogenic peptide in the context of the antigen presenting cell. In the absence of an inhibitory </p>compound, the combination of components referred to will \n\nresult in T-cell stimulation. T-cell stimulation can be detected, for example, by measurement of interleukin release from a T-cell. If, however, the small organic compound has an immunomodulatory effect, "
