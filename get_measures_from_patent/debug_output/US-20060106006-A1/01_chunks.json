A rapid in vitro assay for quantitating the invasiveness of tumor cells. Cancer Res. 47: 3239-3245, 1987. The chamber filters were coated with 50 \u03bcg/ml of Matrigel matrix, incubated overnight at room temperature under a laminar flow hood and stored at 4\u00b0 C. On the day of the experiment, the coated inserts were rehydrated with 0.5 ml serum-free DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 1-2 hours. To study the effects of vanadocenes VDC and VDSe on invasiveness of cancer cells, exponentially growing cells were incubated with these vanadocenes at various concentrations ranging from 1 \u03bcM to 10 \u03bcM overnight. The cells were trypsinized, washed twice with serum-free DMEM containing BSA, counted and resuspended at 1\u00d710<sup>5 </sup>cells/ml. 0.5 ml cell suspension containing 5\u00d710<sup>4 </sup>cells in a serum-free DMEM containing vanadocene compounds or vehicle was added to the Matrigel-coated and rehydrated filter inserts. Next, 750 \u03bcl of NIH fibroblast conditioned medium was placed as a chemoattractant in 24-well plates and the inserts were placed in wells and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 48 hr. After the incubation period, the filter inserts were removed, the medium was decanted off and the cells on the top side of the filter that did not migrate were scrapped off with a cotton tipped applicator. The invasive cells that migrated to the lower side of the filter were fixed, stained with Hema-3 solutions and counted under microscope. Five to 10 random fields per filter were counted to determine the mean (\u00b1SE) values for the invasive fraction. The invasive fractions of cells treated with quinazoline derivatives were compared to those of DMSO treated control cells and the percent inhibition of invasiveness was determined using the formula: % Inhibition=100\u00d7 (1-Invasive Fraction of Drug-Treated Cells/Invasive Fraction of Control Cells). Each treatment condition was evaluated in duplicate in 3 independent experiments. IC50 values were calculated by non-linear regression analysis using an Graphpad Prism software version 2.0 (Graphpad Software, Inc., San Diego, Calif.). </p> Apoptosis Assays </p> A flow cytometric two-color terminal dideoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated digoxigenin-uridine triphosphate (dUTP) nick-end labeling assay (TUNEL) was employed to detect apoptotic nuclei.

Exponentially growing cells (10<sup>6</sup>/ml) were incubated in DMSO alone (0.2%) or treated with 100 \u03bcM each of the 16 vanadocenes (VDB, VDC, VMDC, VDI, VDA, VDCN, VDOCN, VDSCN, VDSeCN, VDT, VDCO, VDFe, VD(acac), VDH, VD(dpy), and VD(dtc) in 0.1% DMSO for 24 h. Cells were washed in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min on ice. Following two washings in PBS, they were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate for 2 min on ice, and washed twice in PBS. Labeling of exposed 3\u2032-hydroxyl (3\u2032-OH) ends of fragmented nuclear DNA was performed using TdT and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated dUTP according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, Ind.). Cells were counterstained with 5 \u03bcg/ml PI. Control samples included: (i) untreated cells; (ii) cells incubated with the reaction mixture without the TdT enzyme. Cells were analyzed with a FACS Calibur flow cytomete"
