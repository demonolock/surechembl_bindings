Commercially available sealants consist of two components, a fibrinogen-containing component and a thrombin-containing component, such components typically being supplied in the form of a dry powder or a separate frozen liquid. The process for reconstituting the powder is time consuming due to the limited solubility of the fibrinogen component and often requires heating. Once reconstituted or thawed, the components are transferred to two separate syringes for immediate use. There are known single component sealants which require cumbersome handling and/or have a short shelf life.</p>Provided herein are single component stable sealant formulations, methods of manufacture, and methods of use comprising fibrin monomers and GPRP peptides or other reversible fibrin polymerization blockers that overcome the disadvantages of known sealant product formulations, methods of manufacture, and/or methods of use.</p>The reversible fibrin polymerization blocking agent may be an agent having a size of less than about one (1) kD. In some embodiments, the agent is a small molecule and/or an isolated peptide, their derivatives or salts, such agent being capable of reversibly binding fibrin monomers and preventing or delaying fibrin polymerization. In some embodiments, the reversible fibrin polymerization blocking agent comprises a small chemical molecule or an isolated peptide. The reversible fibrin polymerization blocking agent may be a binding agent that has a low affinity for fibrin monomers and does not have a permanent effect on fibrin polymerization. Thus, typically dilution and/or small molecule exchange will initiate polymerization. The blocking agent herein does not work by lowering the pH to an acidic pH.</p>In one aspect, a liquid sealant formulation is provided comprising fibrin monomer at a concentration of 1% to 13% (w/v); and GPRP peptide and/or other reversible fibrin polymerization blockers; wherein the blocking agent and/or the GPRP peptide is present in an amount in excess of about 100 or in excess of about 340 molar excess relative to the fibrin monomers; and wherein the liquid formulation is stable for at least 14 days at ambient temperature selected from the group consisting of: about 20 deg.C, 21 deg.C, 22 deg.C, 23 deg.C, 24 deg.C and 25 deg.C.</p>In one embodiment, the liquid formulation is stable for up to 90 days at ambient temperature selected from the group consisting of: about 20 deg.C, 21 deg.C, 22 deg.C, 23 deg.C, 24 deg.C and 25 deg.C.</p>In one embodiment, the liqui"
