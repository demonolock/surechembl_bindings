    " the calculated amount of anhydrous citric acid to 75% of the calculated amount of sterile Water for Injection and stir until citric acid is completely dissolved.3) Add the calculated amount of Captisol\u00ae to the solution and stir until Captisol\u00ae is completely dissolved.4) Add the calculated amount of (s.e.)-((1R,2R,3S,4R)-2,3-dihydroxy-4-(2-(3-(trifluoromethylthio)phenyl)pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-7-ylamino)cyclopentyl)methyl sulfamate Form 1 anhydrous to the solution and stir until completely dissolved.5) Adjust the pH of the solution to a target of 3.3\u00b10.5 using sodium hydroxide solution.6) Adjust the volume of the solution to a target of 2.0 mg/mL (s.e.)-((1R,2R,3S,4R)-2,3-dihydroxy-4-(2-(3-(trifluoromethylthio)phenyl)pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-7-ylamino)cyclopentyl)methyl sulfamate concentration using sterile Water for Injection.7) Filter the compounded bulk solution using a 0.45 \u03bcM clarifying filter followed by a 0.2 \u03bcM sterilizing filter for bio-burden reduction and sterilization, respectively.8) Aseptically fill the sterile solution in sterile and depyrogenated vials.9) Seal the filled vials are using sterile rubber stoppers and overseal using sterile aluminum crimps with polypropylene caps.\n\nBiological Assays\n\nUbiquitin Activating Enzyme (UAE) HTRF Assay\n\n</p>The UAE enzymatic reaction totals 50 \u03bcL and contains 50 mmol HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.05% BSA, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 uM ATP, 8 nM GST-Ubc-2, 35 nM flag-ubiquitin, 1 nM recombinant human UAE or mouse UAE. Compounds for this hUAE IC50 assay are tested at 10 point 3-fold dilution. The top concentration for this assay is 1 \u03bcM. Each compound is ordered in duplicate on the same plate. The enzymatic reaction mixture is incubated for 90 minutes at room temperature (24 degrees C.) in a 384 well plate prior to termination with a stop solution (0.1 M HEPES/0.05% Tween20, 20 mmol EDTA, 410 mM KF, 0.5 nM Eu Cryptate anti-FLAG M2-K antibody (Cis-bio International), 8 ug/mL Anti-GST XL-APC (Prozyme)). After incubation for 120 minutes, quantification of the FRET is performed on the Pherostar (BMG).</p>From the Pherastar raw data files, % inhibition vs. plate based controls is calculated. Dose response data is further processed in Genedata Condoseo, which performs as 4 parameter logistic fit and determines the IC<sub>50 </sub>(intercept at 50% inhibition) for each compound. The results are shown in the following table. For compounds whose values are marked with an asterisk (*), mouse UAE was used. For all other compounds, human UAE was used.</p>% inhibitionCompound no.Example no.@0.111 \u03bcMIC<sub>50</sub><sup>\u2020</sup>I-0018\u200372*BI-0022b\u2002100*AI-0038100AI-0045\u200231CI-0058\u2002100*AI-00613\u200223CI-0078\u200299AI-00813\u200228CI-0094\u200242CI-0107100AI-01113\u200349*CI-01214\u200361*BI-0138\u200284BI-01413\u200230CI-0158100AI-0167\u200299AI-0177100AI-0187100AI-0197100AI-0207100AI-0217\u200297AI-0227100AI-0237\u200296BI-0247\u200298AI-0257\u200293BI-0267100AI-0277100AI-0287\u200299AI-0297100AI-0307\u200299AI-03114100AI-0327100AI-0337\u200298AI-0347100AI-0357100AI-0367100AI-0377100AI-0387100AI-0397100AI-040"
