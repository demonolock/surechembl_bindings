    " METHOTREXATE ANALOGS AND METHODS OF USE </p>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION </p>This application claims the benefit of the earlier filing date of U.S. provisional patent application No. 63/042,262, filed June 22, 2020, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. </p>FIELD </p>This disclosure relates to methotrexate analogs and methods of their use, particularly for treating cancer, autoimmune disorders, and/or viral infection. </p>BACKGROUND </p>Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR, EC 1.5.1.3) catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolic acid (DHF) by NADPH to tetrahydrofolic acid (THF), an essential enzyme in the folate pathway. Tetrahydrofolate is a cofactor in several one-carbon transfer reactions which serves as a precursor in amino acid and nucleic acid synthesis. Consequently, DHFR inhibitors such as methotrexate (MTX) and its analogs have been used for several decades as potent anti-cancer agents. In addition, MTX has been used to treat autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. DHFR inhibition by MTX resulted in reduced intracellular levels of tetrahydrofolate coenzymes, which resulted in inhibition of thymidylate and purine and DNA biosynthesis. Mechanistically, these folate based drugs undergo polyglutamylation by folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) in cells that leads to intracellular accumulation of these analogs (Gonen et al, Drug Resist. Update 15(4) : 183-210, 2012). The reduced levels of THF result in lower levels of serine, lower thymidylate levels, and reduced methionine synthesis, which results in arrest of DNA replication. Unfortunately, resistance to MTX has been a major issue including amplification of the gene for DHFR (Schimke J. Biol. Chem. 263(13):5989-5992, 1988; Goker et al., Blood 86(2):677-684, 1995), decreased transport of MTX due to impaired transport intracellularly, decreased retention of MTX due to lack for polyglutamylation, and mutated DHFR, which result in weak binding to anti-folates, and increase levels of lysosomal enzymes \u03b3-glutamyl hydrolase, that hydrolyses MTX poly glutamates (Rhee et al. Cancer Res, 53(10):2227-2230, 1993). </p>The PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs) concept was first reported nearly two decades ago (Sakamoto et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Set USA 98(15):8554-8559, 2001). The overall hypothesis was to hijack the cellular quality control machinery to degrade proteins of interest. Conceptually, this strategy involves design of heterobifunctional molecules connected by a flexible linker wherein one part of the molecule binds to the protein of interest and the other part of the molecule binds to an E3 ubiquit"
