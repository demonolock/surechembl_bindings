{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences/rows that meet the criteria:\n\n\nThe plate lysis assay results in FIG. 2A demonstrate that both 10 \u03bcg and 1 \u03bcg LysK (0.2 and 0.02 \u03bcmol, respectively; molecular weight (MW: 55.8 kD) produce a zone of clearing, indicating that 1 \u03bcg LysK in 10 \u03bcl of buffer is effective at eliminating the S. aureus lawn, consistent with previous reports (Becker et al. 2009b., supra; Baba and Schneewind, supra).\nIn contrast, only 10 \u03bcg of Ply187AN (0.5 \u03bcmol; MW: 18.9 kD) produced a zone of clearing in the plate lysis assay, indicating that Ply187AN is much less effective than LysK in this assay.\nSurprisingly, Ply187AN-KSH3b produces a zone of clearing at 10, 1 and 0.1 \u03bcg (0.3, 0.03 and 0.003 \u03bcmol, respectively; MW: 30.6 kD), indicating that Ply187AN-KSH3b is more active than Ply187AN and LysK."}
