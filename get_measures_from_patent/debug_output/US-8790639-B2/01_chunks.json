    " culture equivalents of mid log phase S. aureus cells (OD<sub>600nm</sub>=0.4-0.6) embedded in the gel as described previously (Becker et al. 2009b, supra), to verify the absence of co-purifying lytic contaminants. Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE of each purified protein C-His-Ply187AN and C-His-Ply187AN-KSH3b indicated that the two constructs were able to be expressed in E. coli and purified at greater than 95% purity. Zones of lysis on the zymogram gel run in parallel with the SDS-PAGE indicate that the predicted protein in each preparation is the only protein with staphylolytic activity (FIG. 1B).</p>Example 4Plate Lysis AssayTo verify and quantify the lytic activity against live S. aureus, we have tested Ply187AN-KSH3b, the parental truncation (Ply187AN), and a strong antimicrobial endolysin, LysK (Becker et al. 2009b, supra; Baba and Schneewind, supra) in three different antimicrobial assays. Purified proteins for each construct were diluted in sterile nickel column elution buffer and six microliters containing (10, 1.0 and 0.1 \u03bcg) was spotted onto a freshly spread lawn of growing cells that had air dried for 30 min on tryptic soy agar plates. The spotted plates were air dried for 10 min in a laminar flow hood, and incubated overnight in a 37\u00b0 C. environment. Scoring of the cleared spots occurred within 20 hr of plating the cells.</p>The plate lysis assay results in FIG. 2A demonstrate that both 10 \u03bcg and 1 \u03bcg LysK (0.2 and 0.02 \u03bcmol, respectively; molecular weight (MW: 55.8 kD) produce a zone of clearing, indicating that 1 \u03bcg LysK in 10 \u03bcl of buffer is effective at eliminating the S. aureus lawn, consistent with previous reports (Becker et al. 2009b., supra; Baba and Schneewind, supra). In contrast, only 10 \u03bcg of Ply187AN (0.5 \u03bcmol; MW: 18.9 kD) produced a zone of clearing in the plate lysis assay, indicating that Ply187AN is much less effective than LysK in this assay. Surprisingly, Ply187AN-KSH3b produces a zone of clearing at 10, 1 and 0.1 \u03bcg (0.3, 0.03 and 0.003 \u03bcmol, respectively; MW: 30.6 kD), indicating that Ply187AN-KSH3b is more active than Ply187AN and LysK.</p>To determine the specificity of Ply187AN-KSH3b for staphylococcal cells, we tested the enzyme in plate lysis assays against a collection of staphylococcal and non-staphylococcal strains in comparison with LysK (Table 1). The staphylococcal strains included bovine mastitis isolates, MRSA strains, and coagulase negative staphylococci. Both the fusion protein and LysK were able to lyse all staphylococcal strains tested, with Ply187AN-KSH3b exhibiting higher activity than LysK against many strains when compared on a molar basis. In contrast, both enzymes were inactive against non-staphylococcal strains with the exception of Ply187AN-KSH3b showing weak activity against Streptococcus dysgalactiae.</p>TABLE 1Susceptibility of multiple bacterial strains to lysis by the parentalenzyme LysK and the fusion protein Ply187AN-KSH3bSusceptibility<sup>1</sup>Ply187AN-StrainSourceLysKKSH3bStaphylococcus aureus strainsNewman<sup>2</sup>++++(+)MN8<sup>2</sup>++(+)+++SA113<sup>2</sup>+++++Reynolds CP5<sup>2</sup>++(+)+++Newbould (305)ATCC 29740++(+)+++SA019<sup>3</sup>++(+)+++SA020<sup>3</sup>++(+)++(+)SA021<sup>3</sup>++++SA026<sup>3</sup>++++(+)NRS382 (MRSA)NRS 382+(+)++(+)NRS383 (MRSA)NRS 383++++(+)NRS384 (MRSA)NRS 384+++++NRS385 (MRSA)NRS 385++++(+)Staphylococcus chromogenes<sup>4</sup>++(+)++(+)Staphylococcus epidermidis<sup>4</sup>+++++Staphylococcus hyicus<sup>4</sup>++++++Staphylococcus simulans<sup>4</sup>++(+"
