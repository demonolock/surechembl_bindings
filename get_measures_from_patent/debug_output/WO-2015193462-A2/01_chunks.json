The reasons for such variability of conclusions might be due to differences in the study designs, heterogeneity of the treated patients, the varying ESA dose regimens and data analysis. </p>Since the first safety issues about ESA treatments were reported in 2003, several groups worked in the hypothesis of a functional EpoR in tumor context, as the logical mechanism exerting the tumor progression under ESA treatments in anemic cancer patients. In tumor tissue and carcinoma cell lines, EpoR mRNA expression levels were detected but very low in comparison with erythroid progenitors. The results were reproduced at protein level by western blot, immunohistochemistry, and in an animal model. These findings were however questioned by other groups due to the use of unspecific antibodies in some of the studies, the lack of signaling activation upon ESA stimulation, absence of EpoR in biopsies or the non-effect of ESAs treatment in tumor animal models. In the positive cases for specific EpoR expression at transcript and protein levels, EpoR levels were ranging from 10- up to 1000-fold lower than in Epo responsive cell lines, or by overexpression of receptor or in erythroid progenitors. This low level of EpoR expression in non-erythroid cells is an intrinsic liability of any experimental approach to study on EpoR presence and functionality upon ESA stimulations in tumor cells. Furthermore, the radioactive Epo-binding assay is one of the most sensitive approaches at the time of revealing ESA and EpoR binding behavior on the cellular surface. It \n\n has been reported that lower levels than 50 receptors per cell makes the measurements unreliable (Um 2007). The very low expression of EpoR in the tumor cell lines and tissue in addition to wide used of unspecific antibodies have constituted so far the \"Achilles heel\" of the functional studies of EpoR in a tumor context. </p>The characterization and prediction of an effective and safer ESA treatment of anemia in cancer and chemotherapy setting constitutes a complex question. The outcome is influenced by the dynamic interplay of many components, and it has to be addressed from multiple angles, which requires quantitative experimental studies at different levels. These different perspectives go from molecular studies of EpoR activation in a single cell to the study of ESAs pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) in carcinoma patients. Due to the complexity, non-linear relationship and involvement of multiple scales, this requires a Systems Biology approach that combines experimental data generation and mathematical modeling. The inventors focused in NSCLC, due to its high impact in the populations and the high prevalence of anemia. This would also simplify the heterogeneity of the outcomes in the ESA treatments and avoid any effect by the different underlying malignancies (11 :24,32). Due to the wide variation of responses to ESA tre",
    " an Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agent (ESA) for use in the personalized treatment of anemia, the treatment comprising the steps of</p>(a) Administration of a (preferably clinically safe dose) of an ESA to an individual patient suffering from anemia and determining the level of Hb at the time the ESA is administered, </p> (b) Monitoring the concentration of Hb in said patient, </p> (c) Calculating from change of concentration of Hb in said patient the number of initial ESA binding sites present in said patient using a non-linear dynamic pharmacokinetic (PK) hemoglobin (Hb) ESA-EPO-R pathway model, and </p> (d) Adjusting the individual dosage of said ESA for said treatment in accordance with the number of ESA binding sites calculated in (c), </p> (e) Optionally, repeating steps (b) to (d). </p>As an alternative embodiment the individual dosage of said ESA is calculated on the basis of the patient's hemoglobin degradation rate. Surprisingly it could be shown in context of the present invention that each patient has a specific hemoglobin degradation rate which correlates with the clinical development of anemia in the patient. Therefore the present invention discloses an ESA for the treatment of anemia in a patient wherein the ESA dosage using the herein described non-linear dynamic pharmacokinetic (PK) hemoglobin (Hb) ESA-EPO-R \n\n pathway model on basis of a predetermined hemoglobin degradation rate, the specific biding properties of the used ESA in the treatment (for example the EC50 of EPOR occupancy by the ESA) and the present hemoglobin concentration at the time the treatment is started. Hence an embodiment pertains to an ESA for use in the treatment of anemia in a patient, wherein the treatment comprises the initial determination of the patient's hemoglobin degradation rate. </p>The hemoglobin degradation rate may either be determined by measuring hemoglobin concentrations in the patient at several time points, for example in an ESA naive or ESA receiving patient, or using the patient's previous treatment history. In accordance with the herein described mathematical model the specific characteristics of the ESA to be used in therapy, for example CERA, are used for determining the ESA dosage. </p>Based in the initial experiments in vitro (ESA depletion experiments) as described in the example section, the mathematical model as disclosed describes the binding properties of each ESA: the association rate \"k<sub>on</sub>\" and the dissociation rate \"k<sub>0</sub>fr\" (the dissociation constant \"K<sub>D</sub>\" is defined as koff/kon). Based in the binding properties of each ESA, the herein disclosed model can calculate the integral occupancy of the EpoR on human CFU-E for 60 minutes. The EC50 (ESA concentration required to obtain half-maximum EpoR occupancy) is calculated for each ESA and this correlates with the ESA activity in hCFU-E. In the integrative nonlinear dynamic pharmacokinetic (PK) hemoglobin (Hb) ESA-EPO-R pathway model, the integral occupancy of the ESA-EpoR is linked to Hb production. The amount of ESA-EpoR is, among all the other parameters, depending on the k<sub>on</sub> and the k<sub>0</sub>fr rate of the specific ESA. Based on the ESA depletion experiments, the mathematical model calculates k<sub>on</sub> and k<sub>0</sub>fr for each ESA. This data can be used (i) to calculate EC50 values for each ESA and (ii) calculate Hb values based on ESA injections. Thereby, the using the non-linear dynamic pharmacokinetic (PK) hemoglobin (Hb) ESA-EPO-R pathway model of the invention, the ESA dosage for achieving a production of hemoglobin in the anemia patient that is sufficient to alleviate the anemia can be calculated. </p>The term \"anemia\" in context of the herein described invention shall refer to a condition wherein the red blood cells are reduced. Anemia is typically diagnosed on a complete blood count. Apart from reporting the number of red blood cells and the hemoglobin level, the automatic counters also measure the size of the red blood cells by flow cytometry, which is an important tool in distinguishing between the causes of anemia. Examination of a stained blood \n\n smear using a microscope can also be helpful, and it is sometimes a necessity in regions of the world where automated analysis is less accessible. In modern counters, four parameters (RBC count, hemoglobin concentration, MCV and RDW) are measured, allowing others (hematocrit, MCH and MCHC) to be calculated, and compared to values adjusted for age and sex. Some counters estimate hematocrit from direct measurements. In the context of the present invention anemia is present if an individual has a hemoglobin (Hb) concentration of less than 14 g/dL, more preferably of less than 12 g/dL, most preferably of less than 11 g/dL. </p>In certain embodiments of the invention the anemia to be treated",

This model describes the following reaction scheme which is based on prior biological knowledge. The ESA binds reversibly (k<sub>on</sub> respectively k<sub>0ff</sub>) to the Epo receptor (EPO-R) which is exposed on the cell surface. Thereby, the ESA-receptor complex gets activated and can induce phosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules like STAT5. The ESA-receptor complex is then internalized (k<sub>e</sub>) into intracellular receptor pools where ESA is either exported (k<sub>ex</sub>) or degraded (kd<sub>e</sub> and 1\u00be) and the receptor can translocate back to the membrane (k<sub>ex</sub>). In addition, a ligand independent turnover (k<sub>t</sub>) of EpoR ensures that the cell is sensitive for a broad range of ligand concentrations. In the equations [] denote concentrations of the respective components. These are, EpoR or EPO-R is the EPO receptor, ESAEpoR is the complex of ESA bound to the EPO-R. ESAEpoRi is the internalized complex. dESA is degraded ESA, either cell-internally (dESAi) or extracellular (dESAe).

    "timated individually for each experimental condition, i.e. combination of ESA and cell type, as they depend on the biochemical properties of the ESA and on the EpoR expression level of the respective cell type. </p>The structural and practical identifiability of the parameters was analyzed using the profile likelihood approach as described by Raue et al. (Bioinformatics 2011). Furthermore, this method enabled the inventors to determine the parameter's confidence intervals and the uncertainties of the model predictions. </p>Example 1: Model based determination of ESA binding properties </p>To assess the role of Epo and Epo derivatives in the context of lung cancer, it was essential to develop a reliable, quantitative assay that enables to determine the number of binding sides per cell and the specific binding properties of different human ESA (Epo alpha, Epo beta, NESP and CERA). The inventors utilized our knowledge that rapid ligand depletion is characteristic for the Epo-EpoR system (Becker et al 2010) and established a robust ELISA assay to monitor Epo removal from cellular supernatants. </p>As shown in Fig. la this enabled us to accurately quantify the depletion of Epo alfa and Epo beta by murine BaF3 cells stably expressing the murine EpoR (BaF3-mEpoR) whereas parental BaF3 cells had no impact underscoring the specificity of the assay. These quantifications in combination with our dynamic pathway model of Epo-EpoR interactions (Becker et al 2010) enabled to calculate the dissociation constant K<sub>D</sub> (Fig. la) as well as the association \n\n rate k<sub>on</sub>, the dissociation rate k<sub>0ff</sub> and the number of binding sides (B<sub>max</sub>) for Epo alfa and Epo beta interaction with the murine EpoR. </p>The estimated B<sub>max</sub> was in good agreement with the results obtained by traditional saturation binding assays using radioactively labelled ligand, further validating the assay. To comparatively examine the binding properties of different ESAs for the human EpoR, the inventors measured ESA depletion by BaF3 cells stably expressing the human EpoR (BaF3-hEpoR) or parental BaF3 cells (Fig. lb). The results showed that whereas Epo alpha and Epo beta are very rapidly depleted, depletion of NESP and CERA is moderate. The quantitative time- resolved data in combination with our dynamic pathway model of ligand-receptor interaction enabled us to calculate that K<sub>D</sub> of Epo alpha and Epo beta, respectively, are with 16 and 17 pM very similar. However, for NESP the model indicates a K<sub>D</sub> of 789 pM and for CERA a KD of 982 pM suggesting for both Epo derivatives a much elevated dissociation constant. </p>Relating the K<sub>D</sub> of the different ESA to the respective association and dissociation rates as shown in Fig. lc reveals that the association of NESP and CERA is much slower compared to Epo alpha and Epo beta whereas the dissociation rate is enhanced. Therefore by combining simple time-resolved quantification of the concentration of Epo in cell supernatants with our dynamic pathway model it was possible to reliably determine the binding properties of ESA and to show that the available ESA differ significantly in their properties to bind to the human EpoR. </p>Example 2: Presence of functional EpoR in NSCLC cell lines </p>To determine the presence of a functional EpoR in lung cancer cells, the inventors first screened a panel of NSCLC cell lines for the presence of EpoR mRNA. Among these we identified three adenocarcinoma NSCLC cell lines that showed significant levels of EpoR mRNA transcripts. As depicted in Fig 2a H838 and H1299 showed moderate expression levels of EpoR mRNA and A549 low levels. H1944 represent NSCLC cell lines with levels below the detection limit (Fig. 2a). Next evaluated was the expression of the EpoR protein in the four selected NSCLC cell lines as well as its functionality. Enrichment by immunoprecipita- tion and detection by immunob lotting revealed the presence of the EpoR protein in H838 and H1299 and at very low levels in A549, whereas it was absent in HI 944 (Fig. 2b). In line with \n\n previous observations the ove",
    "igher in comparison to the NSCLC cell line H838. </p>To examine whether some of the available ESA could have advantages in the tumor context due to the distinct binding properties, the inventors aimed at establishing a cell model system with elevated hEpoR expression levels mimicking the situation in hCFU-E as hCFU-E are only available at extremely limiting amounts. The inventors stably expressed the hEpoR in H838 (H838-hEpoR) and showed by enrichment using immunoprecipitation and immunoblot- \n\n ting that the expression of the EpoR was highly increased and the phosphorylated EpoR was substantially elevated (Fig. 3b). Depletion experiments and model-based analysis revealed binding properties rather similar to hCFU-E (Fig. 3c) establishing the H838-hEpoR cell line as suitable model system to examine the impact of different ESA on cells harboring high levels of the EpoR as observed in the hematopoietic system versus cells expressing low levels as in the tumor context. </p>Example 4: Identification of CERA as an ESA preferentially activating cells with high </p> EpoR expression </p>To compare the impact of ESA on tumor cells that express low levels of EpoR versus cells that display elevated EpoR levels such as H838-EpoR, model simulations were performed. As readout for EpoR signaling, we calculated the integral of ESA bound to the EpoR (ESA EpoR) for the first 60 minutes after stimulation. First these stimulations were performed for different ESA concentrations and predicted the EC50 for both Epo beta and CERA in cells with high EpoR levels (Fig. 4a). The model predicts that a 10-fold higher concentration of CERA is required for the same activation. This model prediction was experimentally validated in H838-EpoR cells by quantitative immunob lotting against phosphorylated EpoR. </p>Interestingly, the model predicted that the ESA concentrations that induce the same activation in cells with high EpoR levels act differently in cells with low levels of EpoR such as H838. As these cells deplete less Epo beta, Epo beta results in stronger activation than CERA in cells with low levels of EpoR (Fig. 4b). Experimentally this model prediction was validated in H838 cells by quantitative mass spectrometry against phosphorylated STAT5. Thus, CERA was identified as an ESA preferentially activating cells with high EpoR expression, such as H838-EpoR and hCFU-E cells, rather than cells with low EpoR expression, such as NSCLC cells. </p>Example 5: Determination of the number of CFU-E cells in healthy subjects and </p> NSCLC patients by an integrated PK/PD model </p>Having identified CERA as an ESA preferentially acting on cells with high EpoR levels, we integrated our model with pharmacokinetic (PK) data to describe CERA dynamics in patients (the integrative (PK/PD) ESA-EpoR mathematical model ; see above). In a first step, the in- \n\n ventors analyzed mean PK values of CERA in the serum of healthy subjects (Locatelli et al.) as well as of NSCLC stage IIIB-IV patients ",
    "cer, the half-life of erythrocytes is shortened and could therefore affect the KHb deg in particular in cancer patients. Indeed, this assumption was \n\n sufficient to describe the experimental PD data for both cancer patients and healthy subjects (Fig. 8b and c lower panels). </p>Importantly, we can estimate the number of ESA -binding sites for individual cancer patients, showing a high patient-to-patient variability and a very different distribution from the healthy subjects (Fig. 8d right). Further, the distribution of the estimated KHb deg parameter differs widely in healthy subjects and NSCLC patients (Fig. 8d left panel). </p>Example 9: Model-based treatment optimization in NSCLC anemia. </p>The current guidelines defined by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) recommend that the hemoglobin (Hb) response to ESA treatment of anemia in cancer should neither exceed increments of Hb &gt; 2 g/dl in the following four weeks after the first ESA dose nor should Hb levels reach higher values than 13 g/dl. These guidelines recommend doubling the ESA dose if there is no response to the treatment (Hb increments &lt; 1 g/dl in 4 weeks after the first ESA dose), or reducing the ESA dose by 25% or 50% if the increment of Hb levels is &gt; 2 g/dl after four weeks and/or if Hb values ranging from 12 g/dl to 13 g/dl are reached. Interruption of the treatment is mandatory if the Hb value is higher than 13 g/dl. We employed the integrative PK/PD ESA-EpoR mathematical model to calculated the EC50 (ESA concentration required to obtain half-maximum EpoR occupancy) for each ESA and determined the CERA doses that correspond to the current guidelines for NESP. Considering the EMEA-recommended ESA guidelines, we performed CERA treatment simulations based on the patient-specific parameters in three NSCLC patients (Fig. 9a). In the case of Patient 1 (ID:2303 CSR NA17101) the maximum CERA dose (equivalent to maximal NESP dose in the guidelines) would be given every three weeks (Fig. 9a upper left panel), and the model predicts no response within the current ESA guidelines (Fig. 9a lower left panel). In Patient 2 (ID: 1022 CSR NA17101) the model predicts a fast hematological response within the current ESA guidelines (Fig. 9a upper and lower middle panels). In Patient 3 (ID:2652 CSR NA17101) the model predicts an interruption of the ESA treatment (Fig. 9a upper right panel) due to overshooting Hb values in response to the treatment within the current ESAs guidelines (Fig. 9a lower right panels). </p>To understand the impact of the current ESA guidelines in the NSCLC anemia treatment, 88 patients from the CSR NA17101 clinical trial were plotted based on patient-specific ESA \n\n binding sites and the Hb degradation rates. Patient stratification was carried out by response prediction within the current EMEA-recommended ESA guidelines (Fig. 9b). We defined as overdosed patients that were predicted to have an Hb increment &gt;2 g/dl in four weeks and/or reaching Hb levels &gt; 1"
