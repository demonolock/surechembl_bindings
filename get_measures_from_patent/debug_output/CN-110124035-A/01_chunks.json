    "A kind of gold nanorods/cium carbonate nanoparticles material, preparation method and applicationTechnical field</p>The present invention relates to bio-medical field of new materials more particularly to a kind of gold nanorods/cium carbonate nanoparticles material,\nPreparation method and application.</p>Background technique</p>In recent years, malignant tumour have become threaten human health one of principal disease (referring to Siegel RL,\nMiller KD,Jemal A.Cancer statistics,2016.CA Cancer J Clin.2016,66(1):7-30.)\u3002\nCurrently, clinic generally uses the strategy assessed again curative effect after being treated, treated after diagnosing to malignant tumour, it is often wrong\nCross optimal therapic opportunity.Therefore, exploitation is able to achieve the integrated method of diagnosis and treatment and has urgent clinical demand and great show\nSincere justice.Currently, the development of nanotechnology provides opportunity for the diagnosing and treating of malignant tumour.Novel nano technology can incite somebody to action\nDiagnosing and treating function integration may be implemented to treat tumour while diagnosing tumor.Therefore, exploitation is diagnosed and is controlled\nIntegrated multi-functional nanometer material is treated to be extremely important to the accurate diagnosis of malignant tumour and efficient treatment.</p>Currently, clinically the treatment method of common tumour has means, these methods such as operation excision, radiotherapy, chemotherapy equal\nIt has some limitations.Photo-thermal therapy (Photothermal Therapy, PTT) is a kind of oncotherapy emerging in recent years\nMeans are (referring to Chen Q, Wen J, Li H, Xu Y, Liu F, Sun S.Recent advances in different\nmodal imaging-guided photothermal therapy.Biomaterials.2016,106:144-66.).Mainly\nThermal energy is converted light energy into using the material with light thermal property and kills tumour cell.Normal tissue to near-infrared abso"
