    " begin the signaling cascade through the phosphorylation of Smad proteins (see Shi and Massague as referred to above).</p>Three isoforms of TGFbeta have been identified in mammals: TGFbeta1, TGFbeta2, and TGFbeta3. Each isoform is multifunctional and acts in self-regulatory feedback mechanisms to control bioavailability for developmental processes and to maintain tissue homeostasis (as reviewed in ten Dijke and Arthur, Nature Reviews, Molecular Cell Biology, Vol. 8, November 2007, p. 857-869). Levels of TFGbeta are controlled by regulation through TGFbeta expression as well as through binding to proteoglycan, i.e., the extracellular matrix (ECM).</p>Dysregulated TGFbeta signaling, such as excess TGFbeta signaling and high levels of bioavailable TGFbeta, is implicated in a number of pathologies, including fibroses of various tissues, such as pulmonary fibrosis and cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, ocular disorders, vascular restenosis, keloid of skin, and the onset of nephrosclerosis.</p>Accordingly, there is a need to provide compounds that block or disrupt TGFbeta signaling in a specific manner, such as through binding to the TGFbeta receptor II. Such compounds can be used in therapeutics.</p>SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSUREIn a first aspect, the disclosure provides an anti-TGFbetaRII immunoglobulin single variable domain.

    " comprises one or more or all 3 of the CDRs of a dAb of the disclosure that binds TGFbetaRII (e.g., CDRs grafted onto a suitable protein scaffold or skeleton, e.g. an affibody, an SpA scaffold, an LDL receptor class A domain or an EGF domain). The disclosure as a whole is to be construed accordingly to provide disclosure of polypeptides using such domains in place of a dAb. In this respect, see WO2008096158, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference.</p>In one embodiment, the anti-TGFbetaRII immunoglobulin single variable domain is any suitable immunoglobulin variable domain, and optionally is a human variable domain or a variable domain that comprises or are derived from human framework regions (e.g., DP47 or DPK9 framework regions).</p>Antigen: As described herein an \u201cantigen\u201d is a molecule that is bound by a binding domain according to the present disclosure. Typically, antigens are bound by antibody ligands and are capable of raising an antibody response in vivo. It may be, for example, a polypeptide, protein, nucleic acid or other molecule.</p>Epitope: An \u201cepitope\u201d is a unit of structure conventionally bound by an immunoglobulin V<sub>H</sub>/V<sub>L </sub>pair. Epitopes define the minimum binding site for an antibody, and thus represent the target of specificity of an antibody. In the case of a single domain antibody, an epitope represents the unit of structure bound by a variable domain in isolation.</p>Binding: Typically, specific binding is indicated by a dissociation constant (Kd) of 50 nanomolar or less, optionally 250 picomolar or less. Specific binding of an antigen-binding protein to an antigen or epitope can be determined by a suitable assay, including, for example, Scatchard analysis and/or competitive binding assays, such as radioimmunoassays (RIA), enzyme immunoassays such as ELISA and sandwich competition assays, and the different variants thereof.</p>Binding affinity: Binding affinity is optionally determined using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and BIACORE\u2122 (Karlsson et al., 1991), using a BIACORE\u2122 system (Uppsala, Sweden). The BIACORE\u2122 system uses surface plasmon resonance (SPR, Welford K. 1991, Opt. Quant. Elect. 23:1; Morton and Myszka, 1998, Methods in Enzymology 295: 268) to monitor biomolecular interactions in real time, and uses surface plasmon resonance which can detect changes in the resonance angle of light at the surface of a thin gold film on a glass support as a result of changes in the refractive index of the surface up to 300 nm away. BIACORE\u2122 analysis conveniently generates association rate constants, dissociation rate constants, equilibrium dissociation constants, and affinity constants. Binding affinity is obtained by assessing the association and dissociation rate constants using a BIACORE\u2122 surface plasmon resonance system (BIACORE\u2122, Inc.). A biosensor chip is activated for covalent coupling of the target according to the manufacturer's (BIACORE\u2122) instructions. The target is then diluted and injected over the chip to obtain a signal in response units of immobilized material. Since the signal in resonance units (RU) is proportional to the mass of immobilized material, this represents a range of immobilized target densities on the matrix. Dissociation data are fit to a one-site model to obtain k<sub>off</sub>+/\u2212s.d. (standard deviation of measurements). Pseudo-first order rate constant (Kd's) are calculated for each association curve, and plotted as a function of protein concentration to obtain k<sub>on</sub>+/\u2212s.e. (standard error of fit). Equilibrium dissociation constants for binding, Kd's, are calculated from SPR measurements as k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>.</p>Another aspect of the disclosure provides an anti-TGFbetaRII immunoglobulin single variable domain that specifically binds to human TGFbetaRII. In one embodiment, the variable domain binds human TGFbetaRII with a dissociation constant (Kd) of about 50 nM, 40 nM, 30 nM, 20 nM, 10 nM or less, optionally about 9, 8, 7, 6 or 5 nM or less, optionally about 4 nM or less, about 3 nM or less or about 2 nM or less or about 1 nM or less, optionally about 500 pM or less. Suitably, where the variable domain has a dissociation constant in the range of about 50 nM to 500 pM, it is particularly suitable for local administration to a tissue of interest such as the lung. In this embodiment, a high concentration of such a \u201cmoderate affinity\u201d binder can be provided as an effective therapeutic. In another embodiment, the variable domain binds human TGFbetaRII with a dissociation constant (Kd) of about 500 pM or less, optionally about 450 pM, 400 pM, 350 pM, 300 pM, 250 pM, 200 pM, 150 pM, 100 pM, 50 pM or less, optionally about 40 pM, 30 pM, 20 pM, 10 pM or less. Suitably, where the variable domain has a dissociation constant in the range of about 500 pM to 10 pM, it is particularly suitable for systemic administration such that the amount in any one tissue of interest is sufficient to provide an effective therapy. In this embodiment, a low concentration of such a \u201chigh affinity\u201d binder can be provided as an effective therapeutic.</p>In one embodiment, single variable domains of the present disclosure show cross-reactivity between human TGFbetaRII and TGFbetaRII from another species, such as mouse TGFbetaRII. In this embodiment, the variable domains specifically bind human and mouse TGFbetaRII. This is particularly useful, since drug development typically requires testing of lead drug candidates in mouse systems before the drug is tested in humans. The provision of a drug that can bind human and mouse species allows one to test results in these system and make side-by-side comparisons of data using the same drug. This avoids the complication of needing to find a drug that works against a mouse TGFbetaRII and a separate drug that works against human TGFbetaRII, and also avoids the need to compare results in humans and mice using non-identical drugs. Cross reactivity between other species used in disease models such as dog or monkey such as cynomolgus monkey is also envisaged.</p>Optionally, the binding affinity of the immunoglobulin single variable domain for at least mouse TGFbetaRII and the binding affinity for human TGFbetaRII differ by no more than a factor of 10, 50 or 10",
    "uch that the presence of TGFbeta has a neutral effect on TGFbetaRII signaling. Suitable methods for measuring a neutralizing effect include assays for TGFbeta signaling as described herein. In one embodiment, neutralization is observed as a % inhibition of TFGbeta activity in a TGFbeta signaling assay. In one embodiment, the single variable domain or polypeptide binds to the extracellular domain of TGFbetaRII thereby inhibiting/blocking the binding of TGFbeta to the extracellular domain of TGFbetaRII. Suitably, the single variable domain or polypeptide is useful where there is an excess of bioavailable TGFbeta and the single variable domain or polypeptide serves to inhibit the signaling activity of the bioavailable TGFbeta through inhibiting binding or TGFbeta to its cognate receptor TGFbetaRII.</p>As used herein, the term \u201cantagonist of TGFbetaRII\u201d or \u201canti-TGFbetaRII antagonist\u201d or the like refers to an agent (e.g., a molecule, a compound) which binds TGFbetaRII and can inhibit a (i.e., one or more) function of TGFbetaRII. For example, an antagonist of TGFbetaRII can inhibit the binding of TGFbeta to TGFbetaRII and/or inhibit signal transduction mediated through TGFbetaRII. Accordingly, TGFbeta-mediated processes and cellular responses can be inhibited with an antagonist of TGFbetaRII.</p>In one embodiment, the ligand (e.g., immunoglobulin single variable domain) that binds TGFbetaRII inhibits binding of TGFbeta to a TGFbetaRII receptor with an inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) that is \u2266about 10 \u03bcM, \u2266about 1 \u03bcM, \u2266about 100 nM, \u2266about 50 nM, \u2266about 10 nM, \u2266about 5 nM, \u2266about 1 nM, \u2266about 500 pM, \u2266about 300 pM, \u2266about 100 pM, or \u2266about 10 pM. The IC50 is optionally determined using an in vitro TGFbeta receptor binding assay, or cell assay, such as the assay described herein.</p>It is also contemplated that the ligand (e.g., immunoglobulin single variable domain) optionally inhibit TGFbetaRII induced functions in a suitable in vitro assay with a neutralizing dose 50 (ND50) that is \u2266about 10 \u03bcM, \u2266about 1 \u03bcM, \u2266about 100 nM, \u2266about 50 nM, \u2266about 10 nM, \u2266about 5 nM, \u2266about 1 nM, \u2266about 500 pM, \u2266about 300 pM, \u2266about 100 pM, \u2266about 10 pM, \u2266about 1 pM\u2266about 500 fM, \u2266about 300 fM, \u2266about 100 fM, \u2266about 10 fM.</p>\u201cdual-specific ligand\u201d: In one embodiment, the immunoglobulin single variable domain, polypeptide or ligand in accordance with the disclosure can be part of a \u201cdual-specific ligand\u201d which refers to a ligand comprising a first antigen or epitope binding site (e.g., first immunoglobulin single variable domain) and a second antigen or epitope binding site (e.g., second immunoglobulin single variable domain), wherein the binding sites or variable domains are capable of binding to two antigens (e.g., different antigens or two copies of the same antigen) or two epitopes on the same antigen which are not normally bound by a monospecific immunoglobulin. For example, the two epitopes may be on the same antigen, but are not the same epitope or sufficiently adjacent to be bound by a monospecific ligand. In one embodiment, dual-specific ligands according to the disclosure are composed of binding sites or variable domains which have different specificities, and do not contain mutually complement"
