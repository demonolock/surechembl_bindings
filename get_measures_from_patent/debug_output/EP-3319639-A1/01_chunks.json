DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </p> I. Local Action of a4 integrin antagonist in murine model of DED </p>DED is a multifactorial ocular surface disease that is associated with symptoms of discomfort, visual disturbance, tear film instability and inflammation of the ocular surface leading to potential damage to the ocular surface tissues (Research in Dry Eye DEWS Report 2007). It encompasses a diverse spectrum of etiologies, such as environmental, drug-induced, contact lens wear, aging. DED can also represent an ocular manifestation secondary to a systemic autoimmune condition, such as, but not limited to, Sjogren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, graft versus host disease, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, ocular cictricial pemphigoid, sarcoidosis (reviewed by Stern et al., 2010; Zoukhri, 2006). </p>As an inflammatory disease of the ocular surface DED is mediated by autoreactive T cells and is associated with corneal barrier dysfunction, increased expression and levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, tear film instability and discomfort. The inventor found that an integrin a4 antagonist, when administered locally to the eye, rescued the corneal",
    "kat J6 cells (human lymphoblast cell line) were grown as a suspension culture in RPMI 1640 supplemented with FCS (10%) and glutamine (2m M). RPMI8866 cells (human B lymphoid cell line) were grown as a suspension culture in RPMI 1640 supplemented with \n\n FCS (10%) and glutamine (2mM). RBL-2H3 cells (rat basophilic cell line) were cultured in Eagle's MEM plus Earles salts supplemented with 2mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1 x non-essential amino acids, 1 mM Na pyruvate 10% heat inactivated foetal calf serum. J6 saturation assay (filtration assay): Binding of the compound of formula I was characterized in human J6 cells which express VLA-4. J6 cells were harvested by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 500g and resuspended in assay buffer (50mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100mM NaCI, 2mM glucose, 1 mM MnCI2). Each well contained 1x10<sup>6</sup> cells and either 10 \u03bc\u039c cold GW559090, to define the NSBs (non-specific binding), or buffer. [3H]GW559090 (0.02-50 nM) was added in a final volume of 500 \u03bc\u0399_ and incubated for 2h at 37\u00b0C. Bound [3H]GW559090 was separated from free by rapid vacuum filtration through pre-soaked</p>Whatman GF/B filters, followed by three washes in ice-cold buffer, scintillant was then added to filter discs and disintegrations per minute measured on a Beckman Scintillation counter. The actual amount of [3H] GW559090 added for each concentration of the saturation curve was measured by counting disintegrations from a 50 \u03bc\u0399_ aliquot of the label dilution range. Saturation binding assay in RBL-2H3 cells (SPA assay): The assay buffer contained 50mM HEPES, 100mM NaCI, 1 mM MnCI2, pH 7.5 (with NaOH). WGA SPA beads were used at 1 mg/well. Cells were harvested and resuspended in assay buffer and 1 million cells were added per well in a white bottomed plate. Cold GW559090 to give a final assay concentration of 20 \u03bc\u039c (to define nonspecific binding) or buffer alone were added and then [3H] GW559090 across a concentration range across the plate was added (nominal [3H] GW559090 concentration range was 0.01 to 200 nM). The final assay volume was 250 \u03bc\u0399_. The plate was then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2h. Disintegrations were counted by scintillation (from the WGA SPA beads) in a Wallac Microbeta plate reader. </p> The actual amount of [3H] GW559090 added for each concentration of the saturation curve was measured by counting disintegrations per minute from a 50 \u03bc\u0399_ aliquot of the label dilution range. </p> VCAM cell adhesion assay: Polystyrene 96-well microtitre plates were coated with IgG at a concentration of 0.05 mg/mL in bicarbonate buffer for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C. The solution was aspirated and the plates washed twice with PBS. The plates were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with a 1 :4000 dilution of VCAM-1 of 3% BSA in PBS. Prior to use the VCAM-1 was aspirated and the plates washed twice with PBS. </p> J6 or RPMI cells (as required) were labelled with the fluorescent dye BCECF-AM (10 \u03bc\u039c and 6 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL) for 10 min at 37\u00b0C before the excess wa",
    "ross two observers and the left and right eyes. The mixed effects ANOVA model included treatment group as a fixed effect and week as a random effect. 95% and 99% confidence intervals were constructed for the disease (5 day DS vs untreated group kept in separate vivarium) and compound treatment effects (treatment vs vehicle). As these comparisons were all preplanned (comparing each treatment to its vehicle group), no adjustment was made for multiplicity. Log10 scale treatment effect estimates and confidence limits were converted back to the original OGD scale, thus representing the estimate for the ratio of group geometric means and their confidence limits. For gene expression analysis, an unpaired T test was performed to compare drug and vehicle treatment. For flow cytometry analysis, a 2-way ANOVA with fixed treatment and random experiment effects was employed to test the treatment differences. The analysis was followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison procedure to compare each of the treatment groups with the vehicle group. T cell density was calculated for each section and averaged across sections for each animal. As the distribution of average cell density data was non-normal, it was analyzed by using non- parametric methods (Kruskal-Wallis procedure, followed by Dunn's multiple comparisons technique). </p>Example 1. Pharmacology of GW559090 </p> [3H]GW559090 binding to human J6 cells was saturable and was described in these experiments by a single binding site with mean Kd of 0.19 nM (0.08-0.43) (geometric mean and 95% CL) derived from 4 separate experiments. A single high affinity binding site for [3H] GW559090 was also shown in rat RBL-2H3 cells which express rat \u03b14\u03b21 , mean Kd 1.04 nM (0.58-1.89). </p>Inhibition of cell adhesion was determined for \u03b14\u03b21 (Jurkat J6 cells) to VCAM-1 and CS-1 (fibronectin domain); for \u03b14\u03b27 (RPMI 8866 cells) to MAdCAM in coated microtiter plates.</p>GW559090 inhibited J6 cell adhesion to VCAM-1 in a monophasic fashion with a mean IC50 of 7.72 nM (2.39 -24.9). GW559090 also inhibited J6 cell adhesion to CS-1 with a mean IC50 of 8.04 nM (3.05-21.2) and to MAdCAM in a biphasic manner, supporting the presence of a high and low affinity site for MAdCAM - GW559090 binding in J6 cells. The RPMI 8866 MAdCAM binding predominantly measures \u03b14\u03b27 mediated cell adhesion. GW559090 \n\n inhibited RPMI 8866 cell adhesion to MAdCAM with an IC50 of 23.0 nM (20.0-26.4). </p>GW559090 also inhibited RPMI 8866 binding to VCAM-1 , and CS-1 in a simple monoph manner with respective IC50s of 4.81 nM (2.82-8.20) and 24.5 nM (identical duplicate values). </p>Table 1. Binding of [3H] GW559090 to a4 integrins and inhibition of cell adhesion </p>Binding (Kd) Human \u03b14\u03b21 0.19 nM </p> Rat \u03b14\u03b21 1.04 nM </p>Inhibition of cell \u03b14\u03b21 - VCAM-1 7.72 nM </p>adhesion (IC50) \u03b14\u03b21 - CS-1 8.04 nM </p> \u03b14\u03b27 - MAdCAM 23.0 nM </p>Additionally, the compound of formula I had been reported as highly selective vs. non- a4 integrins, including LFA-1 (Ravensberg et al., 2006). No significant inhibition was observed by the compound of formula I (at 10 \u03bc\u039c) in radioligand binding assays on 53 receptors and 4 transporters in an MDS Pharma screen. </p>Example 2. Topical treatment with the compound of formula I prevents desiccation- induced corneal barrier disruption. </p> We found a significant increase in corneal permeability measured by OGD staining between the untreated non-stressed (NS) and dry eye control groups (DS5, FIG. 1). Because corticosteroid therapy has been reported to improve corneal epithelial disease of dry eye both in humans and mice (de Paiva et al., 2006a; de Paiva et al., 2006b; Marsh and </p>Pflugfelder, 1999), we used topical treatment with Dexamethasone (Dex) as positive control. Treatment with 0.1 % Dex significantly improved OGD intensity scores. A range of doses of the compound of formula I, as low as 1 mg/ml_ and as high as 30mg/ml_, was investigated. A significant decrease in OGD intensity scores was noted with increasing concentrations of the compound of formula I vs. its vehicle. The most efficacious concentration was 30mg/ml_ (FIG. 1) which was therefore used in subsequent studies. </p>Example 3. The compound of formula I acts topically on the ocular surface. </p> To explore the effect of systemic administration of the compo"
