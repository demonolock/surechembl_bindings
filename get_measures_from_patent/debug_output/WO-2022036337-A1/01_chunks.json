    " or is a major risk factor, for example, and without limitation, a coronavirus infection, acute respiratory syndrome, SARS-CoV-2 infection, SARS-CoV infection, COVID-19, immune-mediated \n\ndisorder, or inflammatory disorder. In still further aspects, the present invention encompasses, but is not limited to the foregoing diseases or disorders. </p>[0048] As used herein, the term \u201cinfection\u201d is intended to refer to any injurious or potentially injurious condition to a cell or mammal that can be caused by, for example, a viral organism. Exemplary organisms include, but are not limited to coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 infection, SARS-CoV, MERS, and the like. The methods and compositions of the present disclosure can be utilized on a mammal afflicted with one or more infections, or as a preventative treatment to a mammal not afflicted with any one or more infections. </p>[0049] As used herein, \u201cECso,\u201d is intended to refer to the concentration of a substance (e.g., a compound or a protein) that is required for 50% agonism or activation of a biological process, or component of a process, including a protein, subunit, organelle, ribonucleoprotein, etc. In one aspect, an ECso can refer to the concentration of a substance that is required for 50% agonism or activation in vivo, as further defined elsewhere herein. In a further aspect, ECso refers to the concentration of agonist or activator that provokes a response halfway between the baseline and maximum response. </p>[0050] As used herein, \u201cIC50,\u201d is intended to refer to the concentration of a substance (e.g., a compound or a protein) that is required for 50% inhibition of a biological process, or component of a process, including a protein, subunit, organelle, ribonucleoprotein, etc. In one aspect, an IC50 can refer to the concentration of a substance that is required for 50% inhibition in vivo, as further defined elsewhere herein. In a further aspect, IC50 refers to the half maximal (50%) inhibitory concentration (IC) of a substance. </p>[0051] The term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d describes a material that is not biologically or otherwise undesirable, i.e., without causing an unacceptable level of undesirable biological effects or interacting in a deleterious manner. </p>[0052] As used herein, the term \u201cderivative\u201d refers to a compound having a structure derived from the structure of a parent compound or composition (e.g., a compound, protein, or polypeptide disclosed herein) and whose structure is sufficiently similar to those disclosed herein and based upon that similarity, would be expected by one skilled in the art to exhibit the same or similar activities and utilities as the claimed compounds or composition, or to induce, as a precursor, the same or similar activities and utilities as the claimed compounds. </p>[0053] It is known that chemical substances form solids which are present in different states of order which are termed polymorphic forms or modifications. The different modifications of a polymorphic substance can differ greatly in their physical properties. The compounds according to the invention can be present in different polymorphic forms, with it being possible for particular modifications to be metastable. Unless stated to the contrary, the invention includes all such possible polymorphic forms. </p>[0054] Certain materials, compounds, compositions, and components disclosed herein can be obtained com"
