combination, by the serum deprivation\nOrbicule with metabolism both NASH stimulant and the compound processing (the 0th day), then update the metabolism on day 4\nNASH stimulant and compound other 3 days periods.Orbicule dyeing is used for lipid accumulation at the 7th day.</p>Lipid is dyed and is quantified</p>Intracellular lipid accumulation measures reagent (Lonza) Lai Dingliang using AdipoRedTM.Use fluorescence plate reader\n(TECAN), fluoremetry standard measure is carried out to orbicule at \u03bb exc:485nm and \u03bb em:572nm.</p>As a result it and discusses</p>The abnormal persistence of the myofibroblast of differentiation is the feature of many fibrotic diseases.After hepatic injury, sink\nActivation process of the quiet HSC experience characterized by being divided into (\u03b1-SMA) positive myofibroblast.PPAR agonist Yi Lafeinuo\nActive (Fig. 9) with anti-fibrosis in the hHSC that brotic cells factor TGF \u03b2 1 is activated with promoting.Herein surprisingly\nIt has been shown that, MSDC-0602, PXS-4728, Ah's lapachone, CF-102 (Na Modesen), vismodegib, PBI-4050, Enbrel card be raw,\nDUR-928, VK-2809 or KD-025 cooperate with the \u03b1-SMA production (Fig. 9) for inhibiting HSC with the combination of Yi Lafeinuo.</p>Since liver is made of different cell types (liver cell, immunocyte, HSC ...), and since HSC is activated\nIt can be generated from the different stimulated object for being related to other liver cells, therefore liver microcomponent model is also used in testing for fibrosis\nIt is treated in combination.The collagen production of microcomponent is increased using the processing of metabolism NASH stimulant.In this model, Yi Lafei\nPromise and CP-640186, GS-0976 and nalmefene synergistic effect are to inhibit collagen production (Figure 10).</p>It is combined, these results show that Yi Lafeinuo and MSDC-0602, PXS-4728, Ah's lapachone, CF-102\n(Na Modesen), vismodegib, PBI-4050, the life of Enbrel card, DUR-928, VK-2809, KD-025, CP-640186, GS-\n0976 or nalmefene (JKB-121) combined collaboration anti-fibrotic effects.</p>Metabolic disease such as NAFLD/NASH is related to inferior grade inflammation.The activation of immunocyte, which generates, changes liver and week\nEnclose the cell factor of the metabolic function of organ (adipose tissue, pancreas ...).The Intestinal permeabiligy described in metabolism and hepatopathy, leads\nThe increase of circulation cell component (lipopolysaccharides or LPS) is caused, the macrophage in liver and peripheral organs (adipose tissue) is activated.By\nThere is anti-inflammatory activity in PPAR, therefore we have investigated whether Yi Lafeinuo and other compounds can inhibit macrophage quilt\nThe activation of LPS.In the model of THP1 monocyte for being divided into macrophage, LPS handles activating macrophage, as passing through\nMeasured by TNF \u03b1 secretion.TNF \u03b1 is inhibited 21% (Figure 11) by individual Yi Lafeinuo (1 \u03bcM).It is especially surprising that Yi Lafei\nTNF \u03b1 is secreted strong inhibition 50% (Figure 11) by promise and the combination of lucky Cabbeen.Therefore, this goes out Yi Lafeinuo and its as the result is shown\nHis compound acts synergistically to mitigate the ability for the inflammatory condition observed in a large amount of diseases for including NASH and metabolic disease.</p>NAFLD/NASH is induced Fatty toxicity, is drawn characterized by the primary Fat Accumulation (steatosis) in liver cell\nIt plays inflammation, cell death, tissue remodeling and finally causes fibrosis.The induced lipolysis as known to PPAR \u03b1 and PPAR \u03b4 aoxidizes and presses down\nLipid processed is newborn, therefore we want to look at whether fat can be prevented in liver cell with the Yi Lafeinuo of other compound combinations\nAccumulation.Therefore, HepG2 cell free fatty acid (FFA) processing is induced to the accumulation of lipid droplet.In this model,\nFat Accumulation is reduced 20% by individual Yi Lafeinuo (10 \u03bcM).It was unexpectedly determined that when by Yi Lafeinuo and CP-640186,\nWhen VK-2809, Ah's lapachone or my Qiao Er combination, the reduction reaches 40% (Figure 12).</p>Also this problem is coped with using the three-dimensional of liver cell (3D) external model, allows more physiologically Liver Regeneration\nDirty structural system.In this model, by obtaining Fat Accumulation with metabolism NASH stimulant processing.Yi Lafeinuo (3 \u03bc\nM fat content) is reduced by 12% (Figure 13).The combination of Yi Lafeinuo and MGL-3196 (1 \u03bcM) is strong by liver cell lipid content\nIt reduces by 28% (Figure 13), shows synergistic effect when two kinds of drugs are used together.</p>It is combined, these results show that Yi Lafeinuo and CP-640186, VK-2809, Ah's lapachone, my Qiao Er\nIt acts synergistically with MGL-3196, especially to reduce steatosis.</p>To sum up, these results show Yi Lafeinuo and MSDC-0602, PXS-4728, Ah's lapachone, CF-102\n(Na Modesen), vismodegib, PBI-4050, the life of Enbrel card, DUR-928, KD-025, CP-640186, GS-0976, nalmefene\n(JKB-121), VK-2809, MGL-3196 and my Qiao Er act synergistically, especially to mitigate the ability of NAFLD.</p>The combination of embodiment 2:ELA and OCA</p>Material and method</p>The assessment that Yi Lafeinuo, OCA and Yi Lafeinuo+OCA are combined in long-term CDAA+1% cholesterine model (12 weeks)</p>Individual Yi Lafeinuo, list are assessed in the fibrosis NASH model of the rat of feeding CDAA+1% cholesterine diet\nThe combined preventive effect of only OCA and the two.150-175g male Wistar rat feeding is compareed into (CSAA) diet, CDAA\n+ 1% cholesterine diet or supplement have Yi Lafeinuo 1,3 and 10mg/kg/ days, OCA 10 and 30mg/kg/ days or composition of medicine (she\nLa Feinuo 1,3 and be combined with OCA 10mg/kg/ days within 10mg/kg/ days) CDAA+1% cholesterine diet 12 weeks.</p>Weight and food intake dose are monitored twice a week.In the last day for the treatment of, rat is put to death after the 6h fasting phase.\nLiver is quickly cut for biochemistry and Histological research.</p>All Animal Procedures according to normal process and according to the suitably standard recommendation nursing and use of laboratory animal come\nIt carries out.</p>Histology</p>Organization embedding and film-making:</p>Liver thin slice is fixed 12 hours in 4% formalin solution first.Then, liver block is cleaned 30 points in PBS\nClock, and the

    "er fibrosis in (30mg/kg/ days), although degree ratio Yi Lafei\nPromise is low (Figure 14).The combination of Yi Lafeinuo (3mg/kg/ days) and Sialon plug ratio (30mg/kg/ days) (passes through tissue to liver fibrosis\nLearn, the release of liver collagen content and PIIINP and TIMP-1 are assessed) and to participate in fibrosis generate, tissue remodeling and inflammation\nThe liver of the gene of disease is expressed, and the beneficial effect (Figure 14) of collaboration is generated.</p>In this model, individual GKT-831 (60mg/kg/ days) does not have beneficial effect to NASH and fibrosis.So\nAnd when being combined with the Yi Lafeinuo (1mg/kg/ days) for not reaching dose,optimum, it reduces liver inflammatory infiltration, NAFLD activity is commented\nDivide and fibrosis (Figure 15).</p>In this model, had using the treatment of GS-0976 (30mg/kg/ days) to liver fat and weight slight beneficial\nEffect (Figure 16).However, the combination with the Yi Lafeinuo (1mg/kg/ days) for not reaching dose,optimum causes to body fat burning\nSynergy leads to 20% weight loss and the surprising reduction (Figure 16) of fatty degeneration of liver and content of triglyceride.</p>To sum up, we have found Yi Lafeinuo and MSDC-0602, PXS-4728, MT-3995 (Ah's lapachone), CF-\n102 (Na Modesen), vismodegib, PBI-4050, Ji Kabin, CP-640186, GS-0976, JKB-121 (nalmefene), VK-\n2809, MGL-3196, my Qiao Er, Enbrel card be raw, DUR-928 (25- hydroxycholesterol oxycholesterol -3- sulfuric ester), Sialon plug ratio, KD-\nSynergistic effect between 025 or GKT-831.</p>Bibliography</p>Brunt EM etc., 1999, Am J Gastroenterol\uff1b94(9):2467-74</p>Kleiner DE etc., 2005, Hepatology\uff1b41(6):1313-21</p>"
