In certain embodiments, the storage is at 5\u00b0 C. for up to three years.</p>A protein \u201cretains its physical stability\u201d in a pharmaceutical formulation if it shows no signs or very little of aggregation, precipitation and/or denaturation upon visual examination of color and/or clarity, or as measured by UV light scattering or by size exclusion chromatography.</p>A protein \u201cretains its chemical stability\u201d in a pharmaceutical formulation, if the chemical stability at a given time is such that the protein is considered to still retain its biological activity as defined below. Chemical stability can be assessed by detecting and quantifying chemically altered forms of the protein. Chemical alteration may involve size modification (e.g. clipping) which can be evaluated using size exclusion chromatography, SDS-PAGE and/or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI/TQF MS), for example. Other types of chemical alteration include charge alteration (e.g. occurring as a result of deamidation) which can be evaluated by ion-exchange chromatography or imaged capillary isoelectric focusing (icIEF), for example.</p>An antibody \u201cretains its biological activity\u201d in a pharmaceutical formulation, if the biological activity of the antibody at a given time is within about 10% (within the errors of the assay) of the biological activity exhibited at the time the pharmaceutical formulation was prepared as determined in an antigen binding assay or a potency assay, for example.</p>Herein, \u201cbiological activity\u201d of a monoclonal antibody refers to the ability of the antibody to bind to antigen. It can further include antibody binding to antigen and resulting in a measurable biological response which can be measured in vitro or in vivo. Such activity may be antagonistic or agonistic.</p>A \u201cdeamidated\u201d monoclonal antibody is one in which one or more asparagine residues thereof has been derivitized, e.g. to an aspartic acid or an iso-aspartic acid.</p>An antibody which is \u201csusceptible to deamidation\u201d is one comprising one or more residues which has been found to be prone to deamidate.</p>An antibody which is \u201csusceptible to aggregation\u201d is one which has been found to aggregate with other antibody molecule(s), especially upon freezing and/or agitation.</p>An antibody which is \u201csusceptible to fragmentation\u201d is one which has been found to be cleaved into two or more fragments, for example at a hinge region thereof.</p>By \u201creducing deamidation, aggregation, or fragmentation\u201d is intended preventing or decreasing the amount of deamidation, aggregation, or fragmentation relative to the monoclonal antibody formulated at a different pH or in a different buffer.</p>The antibody which is formulated is essentially pure and desirably essentially homogeneous (e.g., Tree from contaminating proteins etc). \u201cEssentially pure\u201d antibody means a composition comprising at least about 90% by weight of the antibody, based on total w",
    "l-, myristamidopropyl-, palmidopropy-, or isostearamidopropyl-betaine (e.g. lauroamidopropyl); myristamidopropyl-, palmidopropyl-, or isostearamidopropyl-dimethylamine; sodium methyl cocoyl-, or disodium methyl oleyl-taurate; and the MONAQUA\u2122 series (Mona Industries, Inc., Paterson, N.J.); polyethyl glycol, polypropyl glycol, and copolymers of ethylene and propylene glycol (e.g. Pluronics, PF68 etc); etc. In one embodiment, the surfactant is polysorbate 20.</p>A \u201cpreservative\u201d is a compound which can be optionally included in the formulation to essentially reduce bacterial action therein, thus facilitating the production of a multi-use formulation, for example. Examples of potential preservatives include octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride, hexamethonium chloride, benzalkonium chloride (a mixture of alkylbenzyldimethylammonium chlorides in which the alkyl groups are long-chain compounds), and benzethonium chloride. Other types of preservatives include aromatic alcohols such as phenol, butyl and benzyl alcohol, alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben, catechol, resorcinol, cyclohexanol, 3-pentanol, and m-cresol. In one embodiment, the preservative herein is benzyl alcohol.</p>A \u201cpolyol\u201d is a substance with multiple hydroxyl groups, and includes sugars (reducing and nonreducing sugars), sugar alcohols and sugar acids. A polyol may optionally be included in the formulation. In certain embodiments, polyols herein have a molecular weight which is less than about 600 kD (e.g. in the range from about 120 to about 400 kD). A \u201creducing sugar\u201d is one which contains a hemiacetal group that can reduce metal ions or react covalently with lysine and other amino groups in proteins and a \u201cnonreducing sugar\u201d is one which does not have these properties of a reducing sugar. Examples of reducing sugars are fructose, mannose, maltose, lactose, arabinose, xylose, ribose, rhamnose, galactose and glucose. Nonreducing sugars include sucrose, trehalose, sorbose, melezitose and raffinose. Mannitol, xylitol, erythritol, threitol, sorbitol and glycerol are examples of sugar alcohols. As to sugar acids, these include L-gluconate and metallic salts thereof. Where it is desired that the formulation is freeze-thaw stable, the polyol is typically one which does not crystallize at freezing temperatures (e.g. \u2212200 C) such that it destabilizes the antibody in the formulation. In one embodiment, the polyol is a nonreducing sugar. In one such embodiment, the nonreducing sugar is sucrose.</p>As used herein, \u201casthma\u201d refers to a complex disorder characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction (e.g., by bronchodilator) and bronchial hyperresponsiveness which may or may not be associated with underlying inflammation. Examples of asthma include aspirin sensitive/exacerbated asthma, atopic asthma, severe asthma, mild asthma, moderate to severe asthma, corticosteroid na\u00efve asthma, chronic asthma, corticosteroid resistant asthma, corticosteroid refractory asthma, newly diagnosed and untreated as"
