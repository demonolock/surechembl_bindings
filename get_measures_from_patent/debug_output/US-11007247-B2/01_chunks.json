    "\u2032 UTR provided transcript stability, the aadA gene and ribosome binding site conferred spectinomycin resistance for selection (FIG. 1a). Transplastomic plants were produced through particle bombardment as described earlier (30). Transplastomic lines were confirmed by Southern blots conferring site specific integration of transgene into the spacer region between trnI and trnA genes. Digestion of untransformed (WT) plant DNA with AflIII showed 4.2 kb fragment after hybridizing with <sup>32</sup>P-labeled trnI-trnA flanking probe and transplastomic CTB-MBP lines showed only the 6.7 kb fragment, confirming homoplasmy and site specific integration of transgene (FIG. 1b). Immunoblots probed with CTB (FIG. 1c) and MBP (FIG. 1d) antibody showed \u02dc28.5 kDa fusion protein monomer, dimer at \u02dc57 kDa and trimer \u02dc86 kDa in CTB-MBP transplasomic lines. Fresh leaves expressed up to 2% of total leaf protein but a 17-fold enhanced antigen concentration was achieved by lyophilization of the plant material (FIG. 1 c, i). Equal loading of protein showed a significant difference in accumulation of CTB-MBP between fresh and lyophilized materials (FIG. 1e). Moreover immunoblots probed with CTB antibody showed that lyophilized material maintained stability at room temperature and protection from degradation over 7 months of storage (FIG. 1f).</p>The functionality of CTB-MBP fusion protein was evaluated by GM1 ELISA, where the ability of CTB to bind to GM1 receptors depends on its pentameric form. GM1 binding assay showed that pentamers of fresh weight and lyophilized CTB-MBP were formed, confirming proper folding and disulfide bond formation (FIG. 1h). Non-reducing native PAGE immunoblots probed with CTB antibody further confirmed formation of the pentameric structure (FIG. 1g) within transgenic chloroplasts, attesting functionality of CTB-MBP for in vivo studies. Lyophilization process preserved the folding and disulfide bonds of CTB-MBP protein even after prolonged storage at room temperature (FIG. 1f).</p>Oral Delivery of Bioencapsulated CTB-GFP and CTB-MBP Across BBB/BRB</p>Oral gavage of CTB-GFP bioencapsulated plant cells created in a previous study (24) showed GFP fluorescence in mouse circulation system. Healthy C57BL/6J mice showed uptake of GFP in the sera and different organs (FIG. 2a) measured by using GFP ELISA kit. After 2 hours of gavage, 364 pg/ml of GFP was observed in the sera, and a lot more in other organs, showing very efficient and rapid delivery into the circulatory system. The highest GFP retention (2512 pg/mg) was observed in the liver, followed by lung (1720 pg/mg), kidney (1446 pg/mg) and heart (509 pg/mg). A concentration of 348 pg/mg and 945 pg/mg of GFP uptake in the brain and retinal tissue of mice, sacrificed after 5 hours of the last gavage, shows delivery of GFP across the BBB and BRB in healthy mice having fully intact BBB/BRB. Healthy mice orally gavaged with bioencapsulated CTB-MBP plant leaf material for three consecutive days showed "
