    "ch is thought to be involved in disulfide bond formation (Kikuchi et al. 2002 J. Biochem (Tokyo) 132:451- 455). Collectively, these results show that the IRE 1 /XBP- 1 pathway is required for efficient protein folding, maturation and degradation in the ER.</p>Another UPR signaling pathway is activated by the PERK protein kinase. PERK phosphorylates elF2\u03b1, which induces a transient suppression of protein translation accompanied by induction of transcription factor(s) such as ATF4 (Harding et al. 2000 MoI Cell 6: 1099- 1 108). eIF2\u03b1 is also phosphorylated under various cellular stress conditions by specific kinases, double strand RNA activated protein kinase PKR, the amino acid control kinase GCN2 and the heme regulated inhibitor HRl (Samuel 1993 J. Biol. Chem 268:7603-76-6; Kaufman 1999 Genes Dev. 13: 121 1 - 1233). Since genes that are induced by the PERK pathway are also induced by other stress signals, such as amino acid deprivation, it is likely that PERK dependent UPR target genes carry out common cellular defense mechanisms, such as cellular homeostasis, apoptosis and cell cycle (Harding et al. 2003 MoI. Cell 1 1619-633). Collectively, ER stress activates IRE/XBP-1 and PERK/eIF2\u03b1 pathways to ensure proper maturation and degradation of secretory proteins and to effect common cellular defense mechanisms, respectively. The reliance of p58IPK gene expression on XBP-I connects two of the UPR signaling pathways, IRE l /XBP- I and PERK. P58IPK was originally identified as a 58 kD inhibitor of PKR in influenza virus-infected kidney cells (Lee et al. 1990 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 87: 6208-6212) and described to downregulate the activity of PKR by \n\n binding to its kinase domain (Katze 1995 Trends Microbiol 3: 75-78), It also has a J domain in the C-terminus which has been shown to participate in interactions with Hsp70 family proteins Melville et al. 1999 J Biol Chem 274: 3797-380). Recently Katze and colleagues have demonstrated that p58TPK interacts with ERK which is structurally similar to PKR, inhibits its eIF2\u03b1 kinase activity and that it is induced during the UPR by virtue of an ER stress-response element in its promoter region (Yan et al. 2002 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 99: 15920-15925).</p>As used herein the term \"activating transcription factors 6\" include ATF6\u03b1 and ATF\u03cc\u03b2. ATF6 is a member of the basic-leucine zipper family of transcription factors. It contains a transmembrane domain and is located in membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum. ATF6 is constitutively expressed in an inactive form in the membrane of the ER. Activation in response to ER stress results in proteolytic cleavage of its N-terminal cytoplasmic domain by the S2P serine protease to produce a potent transcriptional activator of chaperone genes (Yoshida et al. 1998 J. Biol, Chem. 273: 33741-33749; Li et al. 2000 Biochem J 350 Pt 1 : 131- 138; Ye el al. 2000 MoI Cell 6: 1355- 1364; Yoshida et al. 2001 Cell 107: 881-891; Shen el al 2002 Dev Cell 3: 99-111).
