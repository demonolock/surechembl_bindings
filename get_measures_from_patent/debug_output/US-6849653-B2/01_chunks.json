The starting materials are 8-amino-1-{4-[(aminothio)peroxy]phenyl}-4,5-dihydro-1H-benzo[g]indazole-3-carboxamide (Example 4) and appropriate sulfonyl chlorides, acyl chlorides and isocyanates. Twenty-eight reactions were done in this library.\n\nThe general procedure is as follows: 48 mg of 8-amino-1-{4-[(aminothio)peroxy]phenyl}-1H-benzo[g]indazole-3-carboxamide in 1 mL pyridine was placed in each reaction vessel, then 1.2 eq. of a sulfonyl chloride was added, and the mixture was shaken overnight. Then 3 mL methylene chloride and 300 mg of resin PS-trisamine were added, and then shaken over night. After filtration and washing with 2 mL methanol twice, the filtrates were combined and solvents evaporated. The residue was dissolved in 2 mL dimethylformamide, and MS-TsOH resin (450 mg) was added and shaken for 48 hours. After filtration and washing with 2 mL DMF, the combined filtrate was analyzed by LC-MS and LC. Then the filtrate was evaporated on a SpeedVac and the residue were suspended in 2 mL of H<sub>2</sub>O/tBuOH, and lyophilized for 2 days. All compounds were obtained in solid form, and the majority of the compounds have about 90% purity.
