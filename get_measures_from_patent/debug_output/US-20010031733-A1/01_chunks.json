    "FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0001] The present invention refers to the use of Component B as angiogenic agent in combination with human growth factors. </p>STATE OF THE ART [0002] Component B (hereinafter indicated as CB) is a 81 amino acid protein originally isolated from human urine. The human gene expressing the protein has been cloned and expressed in CHO cells as recombinant human Component B, the protein has a molecular weight of about 8.9 kD and was thoroughly described in WO 94/14259 to which reference is made also for the methods of preparation and its amino acid sequence. </p>[0003] In WO97/39765 the use of CB as cicatrizant was described. </p>[0004] It is also known that growth factors, as for example basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have angiogenic activity.</p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0005]FIG. 1: Shows the implant of a pellet loaded with both active compounds (1A) or of two pellets each loaded with one active compound (1 B) in the rabbit cornea. </p>[0006]FIG. 2: Shows the effect of bFGF and CB on angiogenesis in the rabbit cornea. </p>[0007]FIG. 3: Shows the effect of heat-inactivation on the angiogenic activity of CB. </p>[0008]FIG. 4: Shows the synergistic effect of CB on bFGF-induced angiogenesis. </p>[0009]FIG. 5: Shows the synergistic effect of CB on the angiogenic activity of bFGF. </p>[0010]FIG. 6: Represents a drawing of a typical histological section of rabbit cornea illustrating the main structures observable in following FIGS. 7-11. </p>[0011]FIG. 7: section of rabbit cornea (x200) with a corneal pocket containing 100 ng of bFGF sampled at 6 days post-surgery wherein the arrows show neoformed vessels.
