    "ors was included as positive controls (fluvoxamine for CYP1A2, montelukast for CYP2C8, sulfaphenazole for CYP2C9, fluoxetine for CYP2D6, ketoconazole for CYP3A4 and mibefradil for CYP3A4-preincubation). Incubation conditions (protein and probe substrate concentration, incubation time) were optimised with regard to linearity and metabolite turnover. Incubation medium consisted of 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mM EDTA, NADPH regenerating system (1 mM NADP, 5 mM glucose 6-phosphate, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (1.5 U/mL). Sequential dilutions and incubations were performed on a Genesis Workstation (Tecan, Crailsheim, FRG) in 96-well plates at 37 \u00b0C. A final incubation volume of 200 \u00b5L was used. Reactions were stopped by addition of 100 \u00b5L acetonitrile containing the respective internal standard. Precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation of the well plate, supernatants were combined and analyses were performed by LC-MS/MS. The LC-MS/MS quantification of the metabolites paracetamol (CYP1A2), desethylamodiaquine (CYP2C8), 4- hydroxydiclofenac (CYP2C9), dextrorphan (CYP2D6), and 1-hydroxymidazolam (CYP3A4) was performed with a PE SCIEX API 3000 LC/MS/MS system (Applied Biosystems, MDS Sciex, Concord, Ontario, Canada). </p>Data analysis: The CYP-mediated activities in the presence of inhibitors were expressed as percentages of the corresponding control values. A sigmoid-shaped curve was fitted to the data, and the enzyme inhibition parameter IC50 was calculated using a nonlinear least-squares regression analysis of the plot of percent control activity versus concentration of the test inhibitor. \n\n Table 4: Inhibitory effect of test compounds to CYP enzymes </p></p>Patch-Clamp hERG Channel Electrophysiology Assay </p> Malfunction of cardiac ion channels can, in some cases, lead to cardiac arrhythmias. Investigation of the effects of compounds on cardiac ion channels is therefore recommended or mandatory (hERG) under safety pharmacology guidelines1. The hERG potassium channel is the most prominent target for drug- induced QT-prolongation2,3, an unwanted side effect which can lead to the life- threatening torsade de pointes type arrhythmias. </p> The objective of this assay was to evaluate whether test compound has an intrinsic effect on the hERG K+ current in stably transfected HEK293 cells. Test compound was evaluated in vitro at concentrations of 0.1, 1 and 10 \u00b5mol/L (approximately 5-6 minutes per concentration). </p> 1 The ICH Steering Committee, The nonclinical evaluation of the potential for delayed ventricular repolarizaiton ( 2QT interval prolongation) by human pharmaceuticals, S7B, 10 June 2004 </p> 3 Roden, DM., New England Journal of Medicine, 35010; 2004: 1013\u20131022. </p> Netzer, R., Ebneth, A., Bischoff, U., Pongs, O., Drug Discovery Today, 2001, 6, 78-84. \n\n The whole-cell voltage-clamp technique (automated 8-channel system: Patchliner, Nanion, Germany) was used with PatchControlHT software (Nanion) to "
