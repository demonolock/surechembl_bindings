    "mbinations thereof, and the like. Embodiments of the disclosure include a medical disposable device in which an amphiphilic polymer coating is disposed on the outer surface of an expandable structure. In embodiments, the medical disposable device is a catheter with an expandable balloon having a polymer coating including a therapeutic agent dispersed in the coating. The polymer coating, in embodiments, may include at least one therapeutic agent and at least one amphiphilic polymer or co-polymer. The polymer coating may optionally include additional components such as plasticizers and/or waxes. The therapeutic agent can be either water-soluble or water-insoluble.</p>Amphiphilic Polymers or Co-PolymersIn embodiments, a polymer coating of the present disclosure includes one or more amphiphilic polymers or co-polymers. Suitable amphiphilic polymers or co-polymers include non-ionic thermoplastic polymers or co-polymers. For example, the amphiphilic polymer may be hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), polyethylene glycol (PEG), methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, or co-polymers of N-vinylpyrrolidone with other reactive, double-bond containing monomers such as styrene, acrylic acid, vinyl acetate, vinyl caprolactam, combinations thereof, and the like.</p>The amphiphilic polymer may also be a poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylic) acid, also known as poly(HEMA). In embodiments, the poly(HEMA) has a number average molecular weight, Mn, below approximately 8 KD. In other embodiments, the poly(HEMA) has a number average molecular weight, Mn, of approximately 7 KD. The amphiphilic polymer may also be a co-polymer of HEMA with a monomer such as, but not limited to, glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) or acrylic acid. Co-polymers can be block or random. Methods for producing suitable poly(HEMA) include those disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2012/0076920, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.</p>In other embodiments, polyethylene glycol (PEG) may be used as the amphiphilic polymer. In embodiments, the PEG has a molecular weight from about 1.5 KD to about 50 KD.</p>In embodiments, the amphiphilic polymer or co-polymer is optionally complexed with iodine and the iodine is not covalently bonded to the amphiphilic polymer or co-polymer. For example, PVP, PEG, HPC and poly(HEMA) may be complexed with iodine. PVP complexed with iodine is also known as povidone iodine.</p>Where the amphiphilic polymer is complexed with iodine, the weight of the polymer-iodine complex may vary. For example, poly(HEMA) complexed with iodine has a number average molecular weight, Mn, below approximately 8 KD, for example 7 KD. PEG complexed with iodine has as molecular weight of 1.5 KD to 50 KD.</p>Where the amphiphilic polymer is complexed with iodine, the iodine can serve certain functions. For example, iodine imparts an amber hue to the polymer coating, aiding in visualization outside of the body, and with the coating process. Additionally, as iodine has a large nuclear radius, it can provide radiopacity under fluoroscopy; medical devices possessing coatings of the present disclosure may be visible under fluoroscopy, and the dissolution of the polymer coating can be monitored as a function of time.</p>In other embodiments, the amphiphilic polymer or co-polymer is an ionic thermoplastic co-polymer or co-polymer. For example, the amphiphilic polymer or co-polymer can be poly (methyl vinyl ether-alt-maleic acid monobutyl ester) (available under the trade name GANTREZ ES-425, from International Specialty Products (ISP), Wayne, N.J.) or poly (methyl vinyl ether-alt-maleic acid monoethyl ester) (available under the trade name GANTREZ ES-225, from International Specialty Products (ISP), Wayne, N.J.).</p>In embodiments, the polymer coating may optionally include a plasticizer in the polymer matrix. A plasticizer may be useful to increase the ductility and prevent the coating from cracking or delaminating while bending or folding in the dry state. Suitable plasticizers include, but are not limited to, propylene glycol, triethyl citrate, glycerol, and dibutyl sebacate. In embodiments, the plasticizer is present at 30% to 85% by weight of the amphiphilic polymer.</p>In e",
    " the coating solution provide rapid evaporation, a lower surface tension, and improved substrate wetting compared to an aqueous solution, which aids in obtaining coating uniformity. In embodiments, a suitable coating solution may contain a ratio in the range of 100% to 80% non-aqueous solvent, and 0% to 20% aqueous solvent. For example, solvents with boiling points lower than water can be used singly or in combination in the coating solution 114, such as ethanol, methanol, or methyl ethyl ketone, acetonitrile, isopropanol (2-propanol), and/or butanol that rapidly evaporate in ambient conditions, which consequently reduces gravity induced surface defects such as sagging.</p>The coating solution 114 may be prepared by mixing the therapeutic agent, solvent(s), polymer(s) and other components such as plasticizer into a single container. Several mixing and/or dissolving operations may be also performed prior to combining multiple solutions to form the coating solution 114. For example, where an amphiphilic polymer or co-polymer is complexed with iodine, a complexed polymer solution may be prepared. For example, I<sub>2 </sub>may be dissolved in alcohol (or a solution having a ratio of up to 80/20 non-aqueous and aqueous solvents), then dry polymer powder is added to the I<sub>2 </sub>and alcohol. Agitation and/or heat may be applied to the solution to dissolve the polymer. For example, 0.05 grams of I<sub>2 </sub>is dissolved in 12 grams of 2-propanol. Then 1.00 grams of PVP (360 KD, ISP) is added. The suspension is shaken continuously until the PVP is dissolved, about 1 hour. In an embodiment, the resulting solution is a 20% povidone-iodine in 2-propanol solution.</p>The therapeutic agent can then be dissolved in a separate alcohol, alcohol and acetone solution, or a solution having a ratio of up to 80/20 non-aqueous and aqueous solvents. For example, 0.1 grams paclitaxel is dissolved in 0.1 grams ethanol and 0.18 grams of 50% PEG-400 in acetone at 40\u00b0 C. This solution can then be cooled to room temperature and added to 0.55 grams of the 20% povidone-iodine in 2-propanol solution. In an embodiment, the combined coating solution has a drug (i.e. paclitaxel) to polymer matrix (i.e. iodinated-PVP and PEG-400) ratio (D/P) of 50%, the solution is 31.8% non-volatile, and the drug (i.e. paclitaxel) is 33% of the non-volatile. After coating, the balloon is dried, deflated and folded for delivery. In an embodiment, after the balloon is dried, but before deflating and folding for delivery, the balloon may optionally be dip coated into a separate coating solution containing a wax to form a thin wax coating (not shown) over the amphiphilic polymer coating, rather than incorporating the wax into the amphiphilic polymer coating.</p>Once applied to a medical device, in embodiments a balloon of a balloon catheter, coatings of the present disclosure may have a thickness from about 0.01 \u03bcm to about 10 \u03bcm, in embodiments from about 0.05 \u03bcm to about 5 \u03bcm, in embodiments"
