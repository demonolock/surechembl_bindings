KINOMEscan\u2122 assay is based on a competition binding assay that quantitatively measures the ability of a compound to compete with an immobilized, active-site directed ligand. The assay is performed by combining three components: DNA-tagged kinase; immobilized ligand; and a test compound. The ability of the test compound to compete with the immobilized ligand is measured via quantitative PCR of the DNA tag.</p>The kinase-tagged T7 phage strains were prepared in an E. coli host derived from the BL21 strain. E. coli were grown to log-phase and infected with T7 phage and incubated with shaking at 32\u00b0 C. until lysis. The lysates were centrifuged and filtered to remove cell debris. The remaining kinases were produced in HEK-293 cells and subsequently tagged with DNA for qPCR detection. Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were treated with biotinylated small molecule ligands for 30 minutes at room temperature to generate affinity resins for kinase assays. The liganded beads were blocked with excess biotin and washed with blocking buffer (SeaBlock (Pierce), 1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, 1 mM DTT) to remove unbound ligand and to reduce non-specific binding. Binding reactions were assembled by combining kinases, liganded affinity beads, and test compounds in 1\u00d7 binding buffer (20% SeaBlock, 0.17\u00d7PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 6 mM DTT). All reactions were performed in polystyrene 96-well plates in a final volume of 0.135 ml. The assay plates were incubated at room temperature with shaking for 1 hour and the affinity beads were washed with wash buffer (1\u00d7PBS, 0.05% Tween 20). The beads were then re-suspended in elution buffer (1\u00d7PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.5 \u03bcM nonbiotinylated affinity ligand) and incubated at room temperature with shaking for 30 minutes. The kinase concentration in the eluates was measured by qPCR. An 11-point 3-fold serial dilution of each test compound was prepared in 100% DMSO at 100\u00d7 final test concentration and subsequently diluted to 1\u00d7 in the assay (final DMSO concentration=1%).</p>Most K<sub>d </sub>were determined using a compound top concentration=30,000 nM. If the initial Kd determined was &lt;0.5 nM (the lowest concentration tested), the measurement was repeated with a serial dilution starting at a lower top concentration. A K<sub>d </sub>value reported as 40,000 nM indicates that the K<sub>d </sub>was determined to be &gt;30,000 nM. Binding constants (K<sub>d</sub>s) were calculated with a standard dose-response curve using the Hill equation: Response=Background+(Signal\u2212Background)/[1+(K<sub>d </sub><sup>Hill slope</sup>/Dose<sup>Hill Slope</sup>)]. The Hill Slope was set to 1. Curves were fitted using a non-linear least square fit with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Such assays, carried out with a range of doses of test compounds, allow the determination of an approximate K<sub>d </sub>value. THZ-1(a CDK-7 inhibitor reported in the literature) was used as reference compound</p>As shown in the following table, the Kd value of CY-16-1 clearly shows that CY-16-1 is a potent CDK inhibitor.</p>CY-16-1THZ-1CDK7&lt;1 nM48 nM</p>BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLE 2Inhibition of CDK-7 Enzymatic ActivityMaterial: CDK7/cyclinH1/MNAT1 (Accession number for CDK7; NP 001790, for cyclinH1; NP 001230, for MNAT1; NP 002422.1) Recombinant Human Full-Length protein, Histidine-tagged CDK7 (MW=43.2 kDa), Histidine-tagged cyclin H1 (MW=42.6 kDa), Histidine-tagged MNAT1 (MW=40.5 kDa), were expressed in insect cells. Specific activity of recombinant enzyme complex was measured to be equal to 94 nmole of phosphate transferred to CDK7/9tide substrate (YSPTSPSYSPTSPSYSPTSPSKKKK) per minute per mg of total protein at 30\u00b0 C. Activity was determined with a final protein concentration at 3.33 \u03bcg/mL. Enzyme was stored at a concentration of 0.42 mg/ml in 50 rnM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.02% Triton X-100, 2 mM DTT, 50% Glycerol.</p>For CDK7 activity assay, p33 ATP tracers were incubated with purified recombinant specific combination of purified CDK kinases, cyclins and substrates to monitor the enzyme activity. In these assays, individual reactions were carried out in specific conditions describe below with reaction buffer: 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA, 0.02% Brij 35, 0.02 mg/ml BSA, 0.1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 2 mM DTT. An equal volume of 25% TCA was added to stop the reaction and precipitate the labeled peptides. Precipitated proteins were trapped onto glass fiber B filterplates and excess unlabeled p33 ATP was washed off. The plates were allowed to air-dry prior to the addition of 30 uL/well of Packard Microscint 20. The amount of incorporated isotope was measured using a Perkin Elmer TopCount plate reader. Different concentrations of compounds were added to reaction to assess the activity of compounds to inhibit PDGF-beta kinase. IC50 was calculated using Prism software with sigmoidal dose-response curve fitting. CDK7/cyclinH1/MNAT1: 100 nM CDK7/cyclinH1/MNAT1 and 20 \u03bcM Histon H1 were mixed in the reaction buffer with 1 \u03bcM ATP and 1% DMSO. Reaction was incubated for 2 hours at room temperature and conversion rate of ATP was measured to be 5.5%. Staurosporine and THZ-1(a CDK-7 inhibitor reported in the literature) was used as reference compound. Such assays, carried out with a range of doses of test compounds, allow the determination of an approximate IC50 value. Although the inhibitory properties of the compounds of the present invention vary with structural change as expected, the activity generally exhibited by these agents is in the range of IC50=0.1-1000 nM.</p>As shown in the following table, the IC50 value of CY-16-1 clearly shows that CY-16-1 is a potent CDK inhibitor.</p>CY-16-1THZ-1CDK7&lt;15 nM&lt;15 nM</p>BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLE 3In Vitro Irreversible Kinetics StudyCovalent kinase inhibitors have several characteristics that functionally differentiate themselves from their reversible counterparts. Generally, (1) covalent kinase inhibitors have electrophilic substituents that react covalently with nucleophilic centers on their target kinase; (2) covalent kinase inhibitors exhibit two-step inhibitory kinetics marked by a fast reversible binding event, followed by a slow covalent (irreversible) binding event, which causes the overall kinetics of target inactivation to be slow relative to noncovalent inhibitors; and (3) once covalently bound, covalent kinase inhibitors are impervious to washout of the inhibitors and are no longer ATP-competitive. The scanKINETIC\u2122 assay is used to determine whether the compound is an irreversible inhibitor or reversible inhibitor. Four sets of dose-response curve study Arms (A, B, C, D) comprise a scanKINETIC experiment. Arm A addresses association and dissociation kinetics; Arm B addresses dissociation kinetics; Arm C (in concert with Arm A) addresses association kinetics; and Arm D addresses dissociation kinetics &amp; serves as a control for reagent dilution.</p>In Arm A, compound and kinase are combined and equilibrated for six hours (t<sub>1</sub>+t<sub>2</sub>). In Arm B, compound and kinase are combined and equilibrated for 1 hour (t<sub>1</sub>), and the samples are then diluted (30-fold) in reaction buffer (described above) and equilibrated for 5 hours (t<sub>2</sub>). In Arm C, compound and kinase are combined and equilibrated for 1 hour (t<sub>1</sub>). In Arm D, compound and kinase are combined and immediately diluted 30-fold in reaction buffer. The reaction is then allowed to equilibrate for 6 hours (t<sub>1</sub>+t<sub>2</sub>). Post-equilibration, each study arm sample is combined briefly with liganded affinity beads. All reactions are subsequently washed, eluted, read-out by qPCR, and the data are fit to the Hill equation to calculate apparent K<sub>d </sub>values, as described above. Curve fitting intentionally ignores test compound dilution in Arms B&amp;D. For irreversible inhibitors, the Kd values for Arm A&amp;B are equivalent, since for Arm B, the inhibitor fails to dissociate after the reaction dilution step.</p>BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLE 4In Vitro Irreversible Dialysis Assay700 nM CY-16-1 compound was pre-incubated with 50 nM CDK7/CycH/MAT1 enzyme for 2 h in a buffer comprising: 100 mM HEPES pH7.5, 0.1% BSA, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% Triton X-100 and dialyzed at RT against the same buffer for a total time of 24 h (3 changes of the dialysis buffer, nominal cumulative dialysis factor: 30,000). Control samples included: DMSO+50 nM CDK7 dialyzed in the identical manner Un-dialyzed samples with compound were assembled and incubated for 24 h at RT. Following dialysis, the CDK7 activity was measured in real-time format in the presence of 100 uM ATP and 1 uM substrate peptide. Initial velocity was determined in the samples. The dialysis assay of CY-16-1 clearly shows that CY-16-1 is an irreversible inhibitor of CDK7</p>BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLE 5In Vitro Anti-Proliferation AssayCell antiproliferation is assayed by PerkinElmer ATPlite\u2122 Luminescence Assay System. Briefly, the various test cancer cell lines are plated at a density of about 1\u00d710<sup>4 </sup>cells per well in Costar 96-well plates, and are incubated with different concentrations of compounds for about 72 hours in medium supplemented with 5% FBS. One lyophilized substrate solution vial is then reconstituted by adding 5 mL of substrate buffer solution, and is agitated gently until the solution is homogeneous. About "
