    " (SEQ DD NO: 19) with the following PCR reaction conditions: 30 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, 64\u00b0C for 30 sec; 70\u00b0C for 90 sec; and 72\u00b0C for 7 min. An expected product size of approximately 1000 bp confirmed the co\u03c0ect assembly of the plasmid termed pZP7NX-hzcytorl7-Fc4. This plasmid was subsequently transfected into COS cells using Lipofectamine (Gibco/BRL), as per manufacturer's instructions. The cells were conditioned for 60 hours in DMEM + 5%FBS (Gibco/BRL) after which the protein was purified over a protein G-sepharose 4B chromatography column and made \n\navailable for in vitro bioassays, for example, such as those described herein.</p>C. Generating a Human Zcytorl7 / OncostatinM receptor (OSMRbeta)</p>About 16 \u03bcg each of the pZP9-ONCOMR-Fc4CEE and pZEM228 hzcytorl7/Fc4FflS were co-transfected into BHK-570 (ATCC No. CRL-10314) cells using lipofectamine (Gibco/BRL), as per manufacturer's instructions. The transfected cells were selected for 10 days in DMEM + 5%FBS (Gibco/BRL) containing 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Gibco/BRL) and 250 nM methyltrexate (MTX)(Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 10 days. The resulting pool of doubly- selected cells was used to generate the heterodimeric protein. Three cell Factories (Nunc, Denmark) of this pool were used to generate 10 L of serum free conditioned medium. This conditioned media was passed over a 1 ml protein-A column and eluted in (10) 750 microliter fractions. Four of these fractions found to have the highest concentration were pooled and dialyzed (10 kD MW cutoff) against PBS. The desired heterodimeric soluble zcytorl7/OSMRbeta protein complex was isolated from other media components by passing the pool over a Nickel column and washing the column with various concentrations of Imidazole. The soluble zcytorl7/OSMRbeta protein eluted at intermediate concentrations of Imidazole, while hzcytorl7/Fc4HIS homodimer eluted at higher concentrations of Imidazole.</p>Example 31 Tissue Distribution of Human zcvtor!7 in Tissue Panels Using Northern Blot and PCR A. Human zcytor!7 Tissue Distribution using Northern Blot</p>Human Multiple Tissue Northern Blots (Human 12-lane MTN Blot I and II, and Human Immune System MTN Blot II; Human Endocrine MTN, Human Fetal MTN Blot H, Human Multiple Tissue Anay) (Clontech) as well as in house blots containing various tissues were probed to determine the tissue distribution of human zcytorl7 expression. The in-house prepared blots included the following tissue and cell line mRNA: SK-Hep-1 cells, THP1 cells, Adrenal gland (Clontech); Kidney (Clontech), Liver (Clontech and Invitrogen); Spinal cord (Clontech), Testis (Clontech), Human CD4+ T-cells, Human CD8+ T-cells, Human CD 19+ T-cells, human mixed \n\nlymphocyte reaction (MLR), THP1 cell line (ATCC No. TEB-202), U937 cell line, p388Dl mouse lymphoblast cell line (ATCC No. CCL-46) with or without stimulation by Ionomycin; and WI-38 human embryonic lung cell line (ATCC No. CRL-2221) with or without stimulation by Ionomycin.

    "ulted in a mature start at residue 27(Leu) in SEQ ED NO:2 of the human zcytorl71ig precursor sequence.</p>B. N-terminal sequencing of mouse Zcytorl71ig</p>Standard automated N-terminal polypeptide sequencing (Edman degradation) was performed using reagents from Applied Biosystems. N-terminal sequence analysis was performed on a Model 494 Protein Sequencer System (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). Data analysis was performed with Model 610A Data Analysis System for Protein Sequencing, version 2.1a (Applied Biosystems).</p>A purified mouse zcytorl71ig-CEE sample was supplied as captured on Protein G Sepharose/anti-EE beads (Example 35). The beads were placed in reducing SDS PAGE sample buffer and on a boiling water bath before running on SDS PAGE, using a Novex SDS PAGE system (4-12% Bis-Tris MES NuPAGE; Invitrogen) as per manufacturer's instructions. The gel was electrotransfe\u03c0ed to a Novex PVDF membrane (Invitrogen), and Coomassie blue stained (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) using standard methods. Conesponding anti-EE Western blots were performed to identify the zcytorl71ig band for N-terminal protein sequencing. The mouse anti-EE IgG HRP conjugated antibody used was produced in house.</p>N-terminal sequence analysis of the secreted mouse zcytorl71ig polypeptide verified the predicted cleavage site of the signal sequence resulting in a mature start at 31 (Ala) in reference to SEQ ED NO: 11 and SEQ ED NO:91 of the mouse zcytorl71ig precursor sequence.</p>Example 37 Cos cell binding assay A binding assay was used to test the binding of the zcytorl71ig to receptors comprising zcytorl7 receptor, such as the zcytorl7 receptor or receptor heterodimers and trimers comprising zcytor!7 receptor (e.g., zcytorl7/OSMR, \n\n zcytorl7/WSX-l, or zcytorl7/OSMR WSX-l, or other Class I cytokine receptor subunits). Zcytorl7 receptor plasmid DNA was transfected into COS cells and transfected COS cells were used to assess binding of the zcytorl71ig to receptors comprising zcytorl7 receptor as described below.</p>A. COS Cell Transfections</p>The COS cell transfection was performed as follows: Mix 800 ng receptor plasmid DNA in the following combinations: pZp7pX/zcytorl7 alone pZp7Z/WSX-l alone; pZp7NX/OSMR alone; pZp7pX zcytorl7 + pZp7NX/OSMR pZp7pX/zcytorl7 + pZp7Z/WSX-l; pZp7NX/OSMR + pZp7Z/WSX-l pZp7pX/zcytorl7 + pZp7NX/OSMR + pZp7Z WSX-l) and 4ul Lipofectamine\u2122 in 80 ul serum free DMEM media (55mg sodium pyruvate, 146mg L-glutamine, 5 mg transferrin, 2.5 mg insulin, 1 \u03bcg selenium and 5 mg fetuin in 500 ml DMEM), incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes and then add 320 \u03bcl serum free DMEM media. Add this 400 \u03bcl mixture onto 2 xlO<sup>5</sup> COS cells/well plated on 12-well tissue culture <sup>\u25a0</sup> plate (fibronectin-coated) and incubate for 5 hours at 37\u00b0C. Add 500ul 20% FBS DMEM media (100 ml FBS, 55 mg sodium pyruvate and 146mg L-glutamine in 500 ml DMEM) and incubate overnight.</p>B. Binding Assay</p>The binding assay was performed as follows: media was rinsed off cells with PBS + 0.1% BSA, and then cells were blocked for 60 minutes with the same solution. The cells were then incubated for 1 hour in PBS + 0.1% BSA with 1.0 \u03bcg/ml zcytorl71igCEE purified protein. Cells were then washed with PBS + 0.1% BSA and incubated for another hour with 1:1000 diluted mouse anti-GluGlu antibody. Again cells were washed with PBS + 0.1% BSA, then incubated for 1 hour with 1:200 diluted goat anti-mouse-HRP conjugated antibody.</p>Positive binding was detected with fluorescein tyramide reagent diluted</p>1:50 in dilution buffer (NEN kit) and incubated for 4-6 minutes, and washed with PBS + 0.1% BSA. Cells were fixed for 15 minutes with 1.8% Formaldehyde in PBS, then washed with PBS + 0.1%BSA. Cells were preserved with Vectashield Mounting Media \n\n(Vector Labs Burlingame, CA) diluted 1:5 in PBS. Cells were visualized using a FITC filter on fluorescent microscope.</p>Positive binding was detected for cells transfected with zcytorl7 only, zcytorl7+OSMRbeta, zcytorl7+WSX-l, and zcytorl7+OSMRbeta+WSX-l. No binding was detected for cells transfected with WSX-1 + OSMRbeta, with OSMRbeta only, or with WSX-1 only.</p>Example 38 Mouse zcytorl71ig activates mouse zcvtorl7/OSMRbeta receptor-in luciferase assay A.
