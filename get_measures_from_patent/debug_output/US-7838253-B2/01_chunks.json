    "mplification, a temperature of about 62\u00b0 C. is typical, although high stringency annealing temperatures can range from about 50\u00b0 C. to about 65\u00b0 C., depending on the primer length and specificity. Typical cycle conditions for both high and low stringency amplifications include a denaturation phase of 90\u00b0 C.-95\u00b0 C. for 30 sec-2 min., an annealing phase lasting 30 sec.-2 min., and an extension phase of about 72\u00b0 C. for 1-2 min. Protocols and guidelines for low and high stringency amplification reactions are provided, e.g., in Innis et al. (1990)PCR Protocols, A Guide to Methods and Applications, Academic Press, Inc. N.Y.).</p>\u201cAntibody\u201d refers to a polypeptide comprising a framework region from an immunoglobulin gene or fragments thereof that specifically binds and recognizes an antigen. The recognized immunoglobulin genes include the kappa, lambda, alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon, and mu constant region genes, as well as the myriad immunoglobulin variable region genes. Light chains are classified as either kappa or lambda. Heavy chains are classified as gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon, which in turn define the immunoglobulin classes, IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE, respectively. Typically, the antigen-binding region of an antibody will be most critical in specificity and affinity of binding.</p>An exemplary immunoglobulin (antibody) structural unit comprises a tetramer. Each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one \u201clight\u201d (about 25 kD) and one \u201cheavy\u201d chain (about 50-70 kD). The N-terminus of each chain defines a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The terms variable light chain (V<sub>L</sub>) and variable heavy chain (V<sub>H</sub>) refer to these light and heavy chains respectively.</p>Antibodies exist, e.g., as intact immunoglobulins or as a number of well-characterized fragments produced by digestion with various peptidases. Thus, for example, pepsin digests an antibody below the disulfide linkages in the hinge region to produce F(ab)\u2032<sub>2</sub>, a dimer of Fab which itself is a light chain joined to V<sub>H</sub>\u2014C<sub>H</sub>1 by a disulfide bond. The F(ab)\u2032<sub>2 </sub>may be reduced under mild conditions to break the disulfide linkage in the hinge region, thereby converting the F(ab)\u2032<sub>2 </sub>dimer into an Fab\u2032 monomer. The Fab\u2032 monomer is essentially Fab with part of the hinge region (see Fundamental Immunology (Paul ed., 3d ed. 1993). While various antibody fragments are defined in terms of the digestion of an intact antibody, one of skill will appreciate that such fragments may be synthesized de novo either chemically or by using recombinant DNA methodology. Thus, the term antibody, as used herein, also includes antibody fragments either produced by the modification of whole antibodies, or those synthesized de novo using recombinant DNA methodologies (e.g., single chain Fv) or those identified using phage display libraries (see, e.g., McCafferty et al., Natu",
    "functional hallmark of nociceptors (primary sensory neurons that detect noxious stimuli) and thus approximately half of the menthol/cold sensitive cells may be categorized as such.</p>Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings also showed that a subset of trigeminal neurons are sensitive to both menthol and cold (FIG. 1b). Thus exposure to these stimuli elicited rapidly developing membrane currents that were characterized by pronounced outward rectification (i.e., responses at positive holding potentials were substantially greater than those at negative voltages) (FIG. 1c). Menthol- or cold-evoked currents reversed close to 0 mV (E<sub>rev</sub>=\u22123.56\u00b11.90 mV and \u22120.82\u00b10.25, respectively; n=5), suggesting that they result from the opening of non-selective cation channels, consistent with recent observations of cold responses in cultured DRG neurons (Reid &amp; Flonta, supra). Ion substitution experiments further showed that these currents do not discriminate among monovalent cations, but exhibit significantly higher permeability for calcium ions (P<sub>Ca</sub>/P<sub>Na</sub>=3.22; P<sub>K</sub>/P<sub>Na</sub>=1.10; P<sub>Cs</sub>/P<sub>K</sub>=1.22; n=6) (FIG. 1d). We found these biophysical properties to be particularly interesting because they are reminiscent of VR1 and several other members of the TRP channel family (Clapham et al., Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2:387-96 (2001)).</p>In trigeminal neurons, room temperature menthol evoked responses in a dose-dependent manner (FIG. 1e) with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) of 80\u00b12.4 mM, a potency that is within two-fold of that determined for DRG neurons using calcium imaging (Okazawa et al., supra). Fitting these data with the Hill equation suggests that receptor activation requires the binding of more than one menthol molecule (\u03b7=2.2). In addition to menthol, the mint plant synthesizes structural analogues that also elicit a cooling sensation, albeit with reduced potency. One of these, menthone, elicited very small currents in trigeminal neurons compared to an equivalent dose of menthol (FIG. 1b). Cyclohexanol, an inactive synthetic menthol analogue, had no effect. Cold also elicited membrane currents in these cells in a dose-dependent manner, with a characteristic temperature threshold of 27.1\u00b10.5\u00b0 C. (n=4) (FIG. 1f). As reported for DRG neurons, menthol potentiated cold responses and shifted the thermal threshold to higher temperatures (29.6\u00b10.3\u00b0 C. at 10 \u03bcM menthol). Conversely, increasing the temperature of perfusate (from room temperature to 30\u00b0 C.) completely antagonized currents evoked by 100 mM menthol (FIG. 1b). Taken together, our findings and those of others demonstrate that menthol and cold activate a calcium permeable channel on DRG and trigeminal sensory neurons. Moreover, our electrophysiological data show that both stimuli activate currents with very similar biophysical properties, supporting the idea of a common molecular site of action.</p>Fluorescently labeled antibodie",
    "R1. Native cold-evoked responses in sensory fibers or cultured DRG neurons show adaptation to a prolonged thermal stimulus lasting several minutes (Reid &amp; Flonta, supra; Kenshalo &amp; Duclaux, J. Neurophysiol. 40:319-32 (1977)). We found that receptor-transfected cells showed small outwardly rectifying basal currents at room temperature (\u02dc22\u00b0 C.), but that responses to a subsequent 22\u00b0 C. stimulus were markedly larger after the cell had first been warmed to 31\u00b0 C. (FIG. 4f). This observation suggests that the cloned receptor also shows adaptation to thermal challenges that can be reversed upon heating to room temperature. Desensitization to cold differed from that observed with menthol because it was independent of extracellular calcium (not shown). Interestingly, VR1 shows similar behavior in that desensitization to chemical (capsaicin) or thermal (heat) stimuli are calcium-dependent and -independent, respectively. Taken together, our observations show that the cloned receptor, which we now designate cold-menthol receptor subtype 1 (CMR1), has properties identical to endogenous cold/menthol currents observed in sensory neurons from trigeminal ganglia, as shown here, or from dorsal root ganglia (Reid &amp; Flonta, supra; Suto &amp; Gotoh, supra; Okazawa et al., supra).</p>CMR1 is a Member of the TRP Ion Channel Family</p>The CMR1 cDNA sequence includes an open reading frame of 3312 bp that is predicted to encode a protein of 1104 amino acids with a molecular mass of 128 kD (FIG. 5a). Database searches revealed significant homology between this deduced sequence and members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel family. Within this family, CMR1 most closely resembles the subgroup of long TRP channels, so named for their characteristically large N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic tails compared to other TRP family members (Clapham et al., Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2:387-96 (2001); Harteneck et al., Trends Neurosci. 23:159-66 (2000)). Long TRP channels are also termed TRPM in reference to melastatin, the founding member of this TRP channel subgroup initially identified in melanocytes and whose expression is downregulated in melanocystic tumors (Duncan et al., Cancer Res. 58:1515-20 (1998)). Among members of this subfamily, TRPM2 and TRPM7 have been electrophysiologically characterized and shown to behave as bifunctional proteins in which enzymatic activities associated with their long C-terminal domains are believed to regulate channel opening. Specifically, TRPM2 contains a Nudix motif associated with adenosine-5\u2032-diphosphoribose (ADPR) pyrophosphatase activity and is gated by cytoplasmic ADPR and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) (Perraud et al., Nature 411:595-9 (2001) Sano et al., Science 293:1327-30 (2001)). TRPM7 contains a protein kinase domain that is required for channel activation (Runnels et al., Science 291:1043-7 (2001)). In contrast, CMR1 has a significantly shorter C-terminal region (FIG. 5b) and does not contain any obv"
