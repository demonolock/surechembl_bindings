{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\nIn trigeminal neurons, room temperature menthol evoked responses in a dose-dependent manner (FIG. 1e) with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 80\u00b12.4 mM, a potency that is within two-fold of that determined for DRG neurons using calcium imaging (Okazawa et al., supra).\nAs reported for DRG neurons, menthol potentiated cold responses and shifted the thermal threshold to higher temperatures (29.6\u00b10.3\u00b0 C. at 10 \u03bcM menthol). \nConversely, increasing the temperature of perfusate (from room temperature to 30\u00b0 C.) completely antagonized currents evoked by 100 mM menthol (FIG. 1b)."}
