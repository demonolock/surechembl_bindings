    "thiazole-2-base.</p>Alkyne derivatives II-2 is obtained by suitable pure VIII-1 (flow process 8) usually; This alcohol uses and (consults Synthesis (1981) like Moffat-Swern; 165) and Dess-Martin (consulting J.Am.Chem.Soc. (1991), 113,7277) method for oxidation at first become aldehyde VIII-2.This aldehyde uses the Corey-Fuchs method (to form jewel (gem)-dibromide, then with the n-BuLi reaction, like Tetrahedron Lett. (1972); 3769 is said) or use dimethyl--2-propionyl phosphonic acid ester diazo compound derivative (so-called Ohira ' s reagent; Synth.Commun. (1989), 19,561 is said) or use dimethyl-dizaomethyl phosphonic acid ester (like Synlett (2003); 59 and Synlett (1996), 521) become corresponding alkynes.</p>Sulfone derivatives III-2 by corresponding pure VIII-1 (flow process 8) and 1-phenyl-1H-tetrazolium-5-mercaptan or benzothiazole-2-mercaptan at DEAD or DIAD and PPh\n        \n        <sub>3</sub>Exist down, obtain through Mitsunobu coupling (like O.Mitsunobu, Synthesis (1981), 1 is said).This reaction can be in multiple solvent (for example DMF, THF or DCM), and (78\uff5e50 \u2103) carry out under all temps.The alternative route of midbody sulfide be activatory alcohol III-2 (for example tosylate, triflate or mesylate) respectively with TsCl, Trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride or MsCl; In the presence of organic bases (for example TEA); Under-40\uff5e60 \u2103 temperature, reaction in exsiccant aprotic solvent (for example DCM, MeCN or THF).The pure III-2 of activation-inferior and NaI or KI are in acetone, and reaction generates corresponding iodide under 0\uff5e65 \u2103 temperature.It is as the alkylating agent of 1-phenyl-1H-tetrazolium-5-mercaptan.In the presence of mineral alkali (for example KOH or NaOH), (for example EtOH) carries out alkylation reaction under-20\uff5e70 \u2103 temperature in solvent.Gained sulfur derivatives midbody further is oxidized to corresponding sulfone III-2.This reaction can be used various oxygenants; For example be dissolved in the MCPBA in (for example DCM) in the solvent; \n        \n         that be dissolved in the solvent (the for example MeOH aqueous solution) (consults Tetrahedron Lett.
