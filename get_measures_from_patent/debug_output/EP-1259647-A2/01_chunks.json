    "ligonucleotide is designed to be complementary to a region of the gene involved in transcription thereby preventing transcription and the production of Lngl03 and Lngl04. The antisense RNA oligonucleotide hybridizes to the mRNA in vivo and blocks translation of the mRNA molecule into Lngl03 and Lngl04 polypeptide. The oligonucleotides described above can also be delivered to cells such that the antisense RNA or DNA may be expressed in vivo to inhibit production of Lngl03 and Lngl04.</p>\n  The antagonists may be employed in a composition with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, e.g., as hereinafter described. The antagonists may be employed for instance to treat an inherited susceptibility to asthma. Compos i tions</p>\n  The invention also relates to compositions comprising the polynucleotide or the polypeptides discussed above or the agonists or antagonists. Thus, the polypeptides of the present invention may be employed in combination with a non-sterile or sterile carrier or carriers for use with cells, tissues or organisms, such as a pharmaceutical carrier suitable for administration to a subject. Such compositions comprise, for instance, a media additive or a therapeutically effective amount of a polypeptide of the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Such carriers may include, but are not limited to, saline, buffered saline, dextrose, water, glycerol, ethanol and combinations thereof. The formulation should suit the mode of administration. Ki ts</p>\n  The invention further relates to pharmaceutical packs and kits comprising one or more containers filled with one \n\nor more of the ingredients of the aforementioned compositions of the invention. Associated with such container (s) can be a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceuticals or biological products, reflecting approval by the agency of the manufacture, use or sale of the product for human administration.</p>\n  Administra tion</p>\n  Polypeptides and other compounds of the present invention may be employed alone or in conjunction with other compounds, such as therapeutic compounds.</p>\n  The pharmaceutical compositions may be administered in any effective, convenient manner including, for instance, administration by topical, oral, anal, vaginal, intravenous, intraperitoneal , intramuscular, subcutaneous, intranasal or intradermal routes among others .</p>\n  The pharmaceutical compositions generally are administered in an amount effective for treatment or prophylaxis of a specific indication or indications. In general, the compositions are administered in an amount of at least about 10 \u03bcg/kg body weight. In most cases they will be administered in an amount not in excess of about 8 \u03bcg/kg body weight per day. Preferably, in most cases, dose is from about 10 \u03bcg/kg to about 2 \u03bcg/kg body weight, daily. It will be appreciated that optimum dosage will be determined by standard methods for each treat"
