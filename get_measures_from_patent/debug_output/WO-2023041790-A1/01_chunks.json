    "usion Tables 33 and 34 demonstrate a comparison of - KL grade 2 or 3 subjects treated with either PAAG-OA or Synvisc-One, which is a hyalonic acid gel, and their experience of pain 26 weeks and 52 weeks after treatment. It is shown that looking at subjects diagnosed with KL grade 2 or 3 and/or subjects age&lt;70 years, \n\nboth PAAG-OA or Synvisc-One were able to reduce the pain. However, PAAG-OA showed a better pain reduction after 52 weeks. </p>Results with several combinations of subgroups of subjects In the following, selected data is presented wherein two factors are combined with KL grades. </p>Table 35: Subjects less than 70 years old with a BMI categorized \"overweight\" having at least 50% reduction in transformed WOMAC pain subscale - subjects with KL grade 2, 3, 4, 2-3 and 2-4 - blinded phase - ITT analysis set \n<img id=\"imgf000085_0001\" path=\"imgf000085_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/1039902955/WO/20230323/A1/002023/04/17/90/imgf000085_0001.tif\"/>\n </p>BMI Overweight: 25-29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> </p>Conclusion - overweight subjects less than 70 years old </p>It is clear from the data in table 35 that at the timepoint of 2 years a higher percentage of KL grade 2 subjects being overweight and less than 70 years old experience at least 50 % reduction in pain compared to KL grade 4 and 3 subjects. Remarkably, KL grade 2 subjects had a surprisingly much larger pain \n\nreduction than KL grade 3 subjects at timepoints <sup>1</sup>/2, 1 and 2 years. KI grade 2-3 patients had a similar pain effect at 2 years compared to KL grade 4. </p>Table 36: Subjects more than 70 years old with a BMI categorized \"overweight\" having at least 50% reduction in transformed WOMAC pain subscale - subjects with KL grade 2, 3, 4, 2-3 and 2-4 - blinded phase - ITT analysis set \n<img id=\"imgf000086_0001\" path=\"imgf000086_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/1039902957/WO/20230323/A1/002023/04/17/90/imgf000086_0001.tif\"/>\n </p>BMI Overweight: 25-29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> </p>Conclusion - overweight subjects more than 70 years old </p>It is surprisingly shown from the data in table 36 that at the timepoint of <sup>1</sup>/2, 1 and 2 years a higher percentage of KL grade 2, 3 and 2-3 subjects being overweight and more than 70 years old experience at least 50 % reduction in pain compared to KL grade 2 subjects. </p>Similar results were obtained with subjects categorized with being more than 70 years old with a BMI categorized \"overweight\" having at least 12 or 20 points reduction in pain (data not shown here). \n\nResults and conclusion - data on WOMAC physical function and stiffness - overweight subjects more than 70 years old: </p>Surprisingly, results on pain parameters from WOMAC physical function confirmed (data not shown) that subjects being overweight and more than 70 years old of subgroups KL 3, KL 2-3 and KL 2-4 experienced a larger pain relief than the KL 4 subjects being overweight and more than 70 years old subgroup at"
