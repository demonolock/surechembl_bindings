    "ditional anti-inflammatory agents may be ibuprofen or diclofenac. </p>Combinations according to the invention may be formulated in the same dosage form or different dosage forms. </p>If the combination formulations according to the invention are formulated in different dosage forms, the said formulations may be used at different times or simultaneously or sequentially. </p>Formulations according to the invention may be formulated in a dosage form suitable for oral or topical use. Oral formulations may be in any of the forms of tablet, capsule, extended- release capsule, delayed-release capsule, syrup, emulsion, suspension, coated tablet, layered tablet, orally disintegrating tablet, effervescent tablet, sachet, sublingual tablet. Topical formulations may be in any of the forms of ointment, cream, gel, hydrogel, or lotion. </p>Formulations according to the invention may comprise at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient in addition to the extract of Rosmarinus officinalis leaves comprising at least 0.5% rosmarinic acid. Said excipient may not have any therapeutic effect but may be used to fulfill a requirement arising during the preparation or preservation or use of the formulation. </p>Industrial Applicability </p>Thanks to the invention, agents of natural origin suitable for use as anti-inflammatory agents have been developed. </p>In this respect, the invention is of interest to both end-users in the healthcare sector and drug developers. \n\nExamples </p>Example 1 : IC50 values for COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition of Rosmarinus officinalis leaves extract according to the invention and comparison thereof with known anti-inflammatory agents </p>Rosmarinus officinalis leaves extract used in the study whose results are given below comprises 0.8% rosmarinic acid. \n<img id=\"imgf000005_0001\" path=\"imgf000005_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/1077432584/WO/20230706/A1/002023/12/89/89/imgf000005_0001.tif\"/>\n </p>When the results in Example 1 are evaluated, it is seen that the standardized extract of Rosmarinus officinalis leaves according to the invention over rosmarinic acid shows better or significantly close anti-inflammatory effect than anti-inflammatory agents used commercially for a long time, although it is a natural extract. The anti-inflammatory effect mentioned here is shown through COX-1 and/or COX-2 inhibition. The better COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition compared to ibuprofen and diclofenac, which have been frequently used anti-inflammatory agents in the pharmaceutical market for many years, suggests that these natural standardized extracts may be important anti-inflammatory agents. </p>Furthermore, it can be seen from the table above that the standardized extract of Rosmarinus officinalis leaves according to the invention over rosmarinic acid is more effective on COX-2, and that this extract according to the invention does not have the stomach irritant effect often seen in some anti-inflammatory agents. In this respect"
