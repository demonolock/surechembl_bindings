Effective methods for modulating neuronal activity in vivo should provide: 1) rapid onset of perturbation (seconds to minutes); 2) an ion channel that is non- perturbative to targeted cell types under basal conditions; 3) Iigands selective for the ion channel targeted to defined cell types; 4) a straightforward, single transgene genetic strategy without need to interfere with endogenous ion channels, and 5) the capability to independently and orthogonally perturb multiple populations. Several approaches derived from invertebrate (Slimko et al (2002) J. Neurosci., Vol. 22: 7373-7379) or vertebrate LGICs (Arenkiel et al. (2008) Nature Methods, Vol. 5: 299-302) and G-protein coupled receptors (Armbruster et al. (2007) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, Vol. 104: 5163-5168) do not satisfy all of these requirements (Luo et al. (2008) Neuron, Vol. 57: 634-660). A major challenge in overcoming the limitations of these previously developed systems is the paucity of knowledge about the relationship of structure to function in most of the ion channel or receptor systems in use today.

For instance, changes in ion flux may be assessed by determining changes in electrical potential of the cell or membrane expressing a novel chimeric receptor of the invention upon exposure to a particular synthetic compound. Changes in current and membrane potential can be measured with voltage-clamp and patch- clamp techniques as known in the art. Other known assays include radiolabeled ion flux assays and fluorescence assays using voltage- sensitive dyes (see, e.g., Vestergarrd-Bogind et al, J. Membrane Biol., 88: 67-75 (1988); Gonzales &amp; Tsien, Chem. Biol., 4: 269-277 (1997); Daniel et al, J. Pharmacol. Meth., 25: 185-193 (1991); Holevinsky et al, J. Membrane Biology, 137: 59- 70 (1994)). Thus, the invention encompasses synthetic ligands that exhibit an EC50 &gt; 70 \u03bcM, 75 \u03bcM, 80 \u03bcM, 85 \u03bcM, 90 \u03bcM, 95 \u03bcM, or &gt;100 \u03bcM against the wild-type \u03b1.7 nAChR and an EC50 &lt; 15 \u03bcM, 12 \u03bcM, 10 \u03bcM, 8 \u03bcM, 6 \u03bcM, 5 \u03bcM, 4 \u03bcM, 3 \u03bcM, 2 \u03bcM, or &lt; 1 \u03bcM against a mutant \u03b17 receptor as measured by any of the above-described assays {e.g., fluorescence membrane potential assay or peak/sustained current assay). An \"EC50\" or \"half maximal effective concentration\" as used herein is the concentration at which the synthetic ligand produces a half- maximal response. Synthetic ligands that produce &gt; 40 %, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, or &gt; 75% maximal response on mutant receptors in a HEK cell membrane potential assay (see Example 2) relative to the agonist response on a wild-type receptor to a full agonist such as acetylcholine are also included in the invention.</p>[047] There are a number of methods known in the art for introducing the genetic construct encoding the novel chimeric receptors of the invention in the cells of interest {e.g., neuronal cells). For example, the vector or genetic construct can be transferred into a host cell by physical, chemical or biological means. Physical methods for introducing a polynucleotide into a host cell include calcium phosphate precipitation, DEAE-dextran, lipofection, particle bombardment, microinjection, electroporation, cell sonication, receptor-mediated transfection, and the like. [048] Biological methods for introducing a polynucleotide of interest into a host cell include the use of DNA and RNA vectors. Viral vectors, and especially retroviral vectors, have become \n\n the most widely used method for inserting genes into mammalian, e.g., human cells. Other viral vectors can be derived from lentivirus, poxviruses, herpes simplex virus I, adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses, vaccinia virus, and the like. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,350,67",

Identification of selective ligands for mutant \u03b1.7 nAChR-5HT3 chimeric receptors</p>[0102] A focused 71-membered library of 3-aminoquinuclidine benzamides was synthesized (Figure 2). Representative chemical synthesis procedures for some of the compounds in the library are listed at the end of this Example. It was previously reported that \u03b17-5HT3 is preferentially activated by the R enanantiomer of 3-aminoquinuclidine benzamide (Bodnar et al. (2005) Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, Vol. 48: 905-908). Furthermore, the T- substitution of the benzamide and bulky 4'- benzamide substituents were reported to most adversely affect activity of the \u03b17-5HT3 chimeric receptor. Thus, we biased our library of molecules towards substitutents that would be least active against the \u03b17-5HT3 \"wild type\" (wt) receptor. Additionally, the S enantiomers for many of the compounds were also synthesized. [0103] Using the MP assay, we measured 1118 dose response curves against 43 \u03b17-5HT3 single amino acid mutations and the 3-aminoquinuclidine benzamides as well as ACh, nicotine, and PNU-282987 (Figure 3). Notably, several mutant ion channel-ligand combinations emerged showing selective activity for the mutant chimeric receptor as compared to the wild-type \u03b17- 5HT3 receptor (Figure 4). In most cases, the S enantiomer of a particular compound conferred the greatest selectivity over the wild-type \u03b17-5HT3 chimeric receptor. One exception was the interaction of 38R with \u03b17-5HT3 Q79G (EC50 = 1.6 \u03bcM, no activity against \u03b17-5HT3 wt). We selected W77F (SEQ ID NO: 2), Q79G (SEQ ID NO: 3), and L141F (SEQ ID NO: 4) mutant \u03b17- 5HT3 chimeric receptors for further investigation. The dose response curves revealed a specific interaction of the W77F, Q79G and L141F mutant chimeric receptors with compounds 28S, 34S, 9S, 22S, 38R, and 19S (Figure 4). EC50s for activating these mutant chimeric receptors for these three compounds were in the range of 0.8-3 \u03bcM. Importantly, these compounds (28S, 34S, 9S, 22S, 38R, and 19S) did not induce activate the unmodified \u03b17-5HT3 receptor. In addition to these compounds, there were a number of selective interactions of \u03b17-5HT3 mutant receptors with compounds from the library exhibiting EC50s around 10 \u03bcM.</p>[0104] Several ligand-ion channel combinations also showed selectivity relative to each another (Figure 5). Compound 132S (EC50 <sub>MP</sub> = 4.3 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcM), a fluorinated analog of 28S, selectively activated \u03b17-5HT3 W77F over receptors with the Q79G and L141F mutations. Similarly, 22S and 89S were selective for Q79G and L141F, respectively. Such selectivity is a critical feature \n\n for developing tools that allows separate manipulation of multiple neuron populations in the same organism.</p>[0105] To improve the selective interaction of 19S with the \u03b17-5HT3 L141F mutant chimeric receptor, we synthesized and tested eight 3-aminoquinuclidine-2'-alkoxybenzamide analogs (Table 1). The dimethoxy derivatives, 88S and 89S, exhibited 5-10 fold improvement in efficacy against this mutant receptor (EC50<sub>M</sub>p, 88S: 0.1 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcM; 89S: 0.4 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcM) while exhibiting no activity against the \u03b17-5HT3 wt receptor.</p>Table 1.

Analysis of dose response curves from \u03b17-5HT3 Q139M channels showed higher efficacy for a number of ligands that activated \u03b17-5HT3 wt. However, there is little selectivity conferred by this mutation. We reasoned that in combination with the selectivity mutations \n\n described above, the identified interactions could be improved. In some cases these binding site mutations were compatible, and \u03b17-5HT3 Q79G Q139M showed, relative to \u03b17-5HT3 Q79G, 8- and 20-fold improvement in efficacy over with 38R (EC50<sub>M</sub>p = 0.23 \u00b1 0.07 \u03bcM) and 22S (EC50<sub>M</sub>p = 0.06 \u00b1 0.04 \u03bcM), respectively (Table 2, Figure 6).</p>Example 4. Efficacy of mutant \u03b17 nAChR and chimeric receptors by compound ligands [0107] Several series of small molecules were prepared and the activity and selectivity of the molecules were compared against binding to wild type \u03b17-5HT3. Compounds 28S, 34S, 96R, 97R, 13 IS, 132S, 278S, 279S, and 28 IS each have EC50 values of about 100 \u03bcM for wt \u03b17- 5HT3 and of between about 0.8 and about 7.7 \u03bcM for \u03b17-5HT3 W77F. Compounds 165S, 16S, 115S, 163S, 117S, 154S, 149S, 164S, 22S, 157S, 170R, 156S, 295S, 292R, 296S, 38R, 134S, and 148S each have EC50 values of about 100 \u03bcM for wt \u03b17-5HT3 and EC50 values of between about 0.8 and about 7.8 \u03bcM for \u03b17-5HT3 Q79G. Compounds 19S, 85S, 86S, 88S, 89S, 90S, 91S, 118S, 119S, 120S, 121S, 127S, and 294S each have EC50 values of about 100 \u03bcM for wt \u03b17-5HT3 and EC50 values of between about 0.1 and about 3.4 \u03bcM for \u03b17-5HT3 L141F. Compounds 212, 241, 242, 253, 254, and 255 each have EC50 values of about 100 \u03bcM for wt \u03b17-5HT3 and EC50 values of between about 0.1 and about 15 \u03bcM for \u03b17-5HT3 Ll 4 IF.

We focused on shifting EC50i<sub>pea</sub>k because steady state concentrations of ACh do not rise above 100 nM (Vinson and Justice (1997) Journal of Neuroscience Methods, Vol. 73: 61-67), which is significantly below activation threshold of this channel. Previously, it was reported for \u03b17 nAChR that mutations at residues equivalent to \u03b17- 5HT3 Yl 15F and Y210F selectively eliminate ACh responsiveness while leaving nicotine efficacy largely unaffected (Galzi et al. (1991) FEBS Letters, Vol. 294: 198-202). Despite the analogous pharmacologic properties of nicotine and aminoquinuclidine benzamides, these mutations greatly reduced or eliminated efficacy of PNU-282987 with \u03b17-5HT3. However, inspection of Figure IG revealed multiple binding site mutations which diminish ACh responsiveness. We reasoned that some could be combined with selectivity-inducing mutations to generate ligand binding domains that had orthogonal ligand specificity to the endogenous receptors while being unresponsive to physiologic levels of ACh. Indeed, \u03b17-5HT3 Q79G Q139G retained responsiveness to 22S (EC50i<sub>ss</sub> = 2.7 \u00b1 1.0 \u03bcM, EC50i<sub>pea</sub>k = 11.6 \u00b1 3.6 \u03bcM), while for ACh (EC50i<sub>pea</sub>k = 296 \u00b1 64 \u03bcM) the additional Q139G mutation resulted in a nearly 8- fold shift in efficacy from \u03b17-5HT3 Q79G (ACh: EC50<sub>Ipea</sub>k = 38 \u00b1 2 \u03bcM). Also, for \u03b17-5HT3 Q79G L141S there was only slight shift in the efficacy for 9S, but ACh responsiveness (EC50i<sub>peak</sub> = 356 \u00b1 16 \u03bcM) shifted nearly 10-fold with addition of the L141S mutation (Table T). [0110] To develop a neuron activating cation channel, we further modified the \u03b17-5HT3 channel with three previously described mutations that were reported to provide a 100-fold increase in conductance: R425Q R429D R433A. Addition of this high conductance (HC) mutation, showed the expected increase in channel noise upon ligand application (Figure 7A). After expression of \u03b17-5HT3 HC L141F in layer 2/3 cortical neurons, compound 89S (3 \u03bcM) sustainably increased firing rate in these neurons (Figure 7B).</p>[0111] For neuron silencing, we generated chimeric channels using \u03b17 Q79G or \u03b17 L141F fused to the glycine receptor IPD (SEQ ID NO: 8 and 9, respectively). These channels produced large, slowly activating currents (Figure 8A). To maximize orthogonality with the neuronal activators described above, we further developed \u03b17-GlyR L141F (SEQ ID NO: 9). The ligand activated current in cells expressing this channel showed reversal at the chloride reversal potential, indicating that it operated, expectedly, as a chloride channel (Figure 8B). A notable property is the extremely slow channel activation, which was characterized previously for \u03b17-GlyR (Grutter \n\n et al. (2005) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, Vol. 102: 18207-18212).
