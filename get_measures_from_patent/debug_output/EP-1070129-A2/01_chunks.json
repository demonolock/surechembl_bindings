    "dues may be deleted or replaced with another amino acid to alter the conformation of the molecule. Mutagenic techniques for such replacement, insertion or deletion are well known to those skilled in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,518,584).</p>\n  Other fragments and derivatives of the sequences of DADD proteins which would be expected to retain DADD protein activity in whole or in part and may thus be useful for screening or other immunological methodologies may also be easUy made by those skilled in the art given the disclosures herein. Such modifications are believed to be encompassed by the present invention.</p>\n  DADD protein of the invention may also be used to screen for agents which are capable of inhibiting or blocking binding of a DADD protein to the death domain of TNF-R, DADD or other protein, and thus may act as inhibitors of death domain binding and/or the biological activity normally brought on by such binding (e.g., apoptosis). Binding assays using a desired binding protein, immobilized or not, are well known in the art and may be used for this purpose using the DADD protein of the invention. Appropriate screening assays may be cell-based or cell-free. Alternatively, purified protein based screening assays may be used to identify such agents. For example, DADD protein may be immobilized in purified form on a carrier and binding to purified death domain proteins may be measured in the presence and in the absence of potential inhibiting agents. A suitable binding assay may alternatively employ purified death domain protein immobilized on a carrier, with a soluble form of a DADD protein ofthe invention. Any DADD protein may be used in the screening assays described above.</p>\n  In such a screening assay, a first binding mixture is formed by combining a death domain-containing protein and DADD protein, and the amount of binding in the first binding mixture (B<sub>0</sub>) is measured. A second binding mixture is also formed by combining the death domain-containing protein, DADD protein, and the compound or agent to be screened, and the amount of binding in the second binding mixture (B) is measured. The amounts of binding in the first and second binding mixtures are compared, for example, by performing a B/B<sub>0</sub> calculation. A compound or agent is considered to be capable of inhibiting binding if a decrease in binding in the second \n\nbinding mixture as compared to the first binding mixture is observed. The formulation and optimization of binding mixtures is within the level of skiU in the art. Such binding mixtures may also contain buffers and salts necessary to enhance or to optimize binding, and additional control assays may be included in the screening assay of the invention.</p>\n  Alternatively, appropriate screening assays may be cell based. For example, the binding or interaction between a DADDprotein and death domain protein can be measured in yeast.</p>\n  Compounds found to reduce, preferably by at least about 10"
