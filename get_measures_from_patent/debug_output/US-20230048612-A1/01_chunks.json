    "CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONSThe present application claims priority to Chinese patent application No. 202010008058.6 filed on Jan. 6, 2020 and entitled with \u201cPROGRAMMED CELL DEATH RECEPTOR 1 ANTIBODY FORMULATION AND USE THEREOF\u201d, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>TECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to the field of biotechnology, and in particular, to a programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1) antibody formulation and the use thereof.</p>BACKGROUND ARTProgrammed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1), also known as CD279, is an important immunosuppressive molecule, belongs to the CD28 immunoglobulin superfamily, and is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 50-55 kD. PD-1 is continuously expressed on the surface of T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, monocytes and bone marrow cells. There are two known ligands for PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2. Recently, studies have found that the binding of PD-1 to its ligand PD-L1 can transmit inhibitory signals and reduce the proliferation of CD8+ T cells in lymph nodes. Moreover, PD-1 can also control the accumulation of antigen-specific T cells in lymph nodes by regulating the Bc1-2 gene. Blocking the binding of PD-1 to PD-L1 can effectively prevent the production of inhibitory signals in T lymphocytes, thus breaking the peripheral immune tolerance of the immune system to tissues of the same body, and promoting the activation and proliferation of T lymphocytes and the expression of cytokines. Therefore, developing new anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies for cancer immunotherapy and endowing same with lower toxicity and side effects and better clinical efficacy have become a current research hotspot, and would also provide patients with more drug options.</p>Protein (such as monoclonal antibody) pharmaceutical formulations are suitable for parenteral administration, including intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal or subcutaneous injection and other routes of administration. The liquid formulation is convenient to use, but has a poor stability and a higher requirement for storage conditions, and generally needs to be stored under a relatively low temperature. In addition, the protein in the liquid f"
