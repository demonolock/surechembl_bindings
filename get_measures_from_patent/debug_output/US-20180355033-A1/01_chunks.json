    "Formula I wherein the V domain is exposed on V-V dimerization of the RAGE receptor.</p>In a further embodiment, the method further provides a compound wherein the compound associates with amino resides 44-52 corresponding to the sequence numbering of human RAGE receptor.</p>In another embodiment, the method provides a compound wherein the compound associates with amino resides KPPQRLEWK of human RAGE receptor.</p>Anti-RAGE Antibodies</p>The present invention provides antibodies that bind specifically to RAGE, including soluble RAGE and endogenous secretory RAGE, and competitively inhibit binding of RAGE to one or more specific RAGE ligands, in particular RAGE ligands of the S100 family. Antibodies can be expressed in various ways, as herein discussed. Phage display and yeast systems, as well as other vector systems, e.g., vectors for in vivo expression, are amongst the ways to produce antibodies. See generally \u201cTherapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies: From Bench to Clinic,\u201d edited by Zhiqiang An (Wiley 2009) (available from Google Books), e.g., chapters 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 concerning phage, yeast, ribosomal, bacterial and mammalian antibody display systems (for instance sections 9.2, 9.4 9.6, 9.6, 9.6.1.1, 9.6.1.2 concerning yeast display, tumor applications, and intracellular applications), and the documents cited therein.</p>The invention includes anti-RAGE antibodies that bind specifically to RAGE-expressing cells in vitro and in vivo, and antibodies that bind to human RAGE with a dissociation constant (Kd) in the range of from at least about 1\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M to about 1\u00d710<sup>\u221210 </sup>M. Also Included are anti-RAGE antibodies of the invention that bind specifically to the V domain of human RAGE, and anti-RAGE antibodies that block the binding of RAGE to an S100 RAGE ligand.</p>Also included are anti-RAGE antibodies of the invention that bind specifically to the V domain of human RAGE. The invention defines particularly useful antibodies which exhibit specific binding to amino acids of the V domain which are unexpectedly, exposed on V-V dimerization (exposed V-domain in V-V dimer). For example, antibodies which exhibit specific binding to the linear epitope of amino acids 44-52 of RAGE (Cyno RAGE: KPPQQLEWK; HuRAGE: KPPQRLEWK; MuRAGE KPPQQLEWK; RatRAGE: KPTQKLEWK). Likewise, antibodies which exhibit specific binding to the conformational epitope of amino acids 44-52 of RAGE (Cyno RAGE: KPPQQLEWK; HuRAGE: KPPQRLEWK; MuRAGE KPPQQLEWK; RatRAGE: KPTQKLEWK). Such antibodies provide the unexpected result of specific inhibition of ligand binding to the V domain. Such specific inhibition results in treatment of pre-cachexia and/or cachexia. Preferred are monoclonal antibodies which exhibit specific binding to the RAGE 44-52 conformational epitope, and in particular human RAGE 44-52. In aspects of the invention, the V-V domain dimers of RAGE block aa#23-43 leaving only aa#44-52 solvent exposed for binding to the antibodies and small molecules of the invention.</p>Also included in",
    " to be within the scope of the present invention and antibodies of the invention bind to RAGE with a range of affinities, for example, 100 nM or less, 75 nM or less, 50 nM or less, 25 nM or less, for example 10 nM or less, 5 nM or less, 1 nM or less, or in embodiments 500 pM or less, 100 pM or less, 50 pM or less or 25 pM or less. An antibody that \u201cdoes not exhibit significant crossreactivity\u201d is one that will not appreciably bind to an entity other than its target (e.g., a different epitope or a different molecule). For example, an antibody that specifically binds to RAGE will appreciably bind RAGE but will not significantly react with non-RAGE proteins or peptides. An antibody specific for a particular epitope will, for example, not significantly crossreact with remote epitopes on the same protein or peptide. Specific binding can be determined according to any art-recognized means for determining such binding. Preferably, specific binding is determined according to Scatchard analysis and/or competitive binding assays.</p>As used herein, the term \u201caffinity\u201d refers to the strength of the binding of a single antigen-combining site with an antigenic determinant. Affinity depends on the closeness of stereochemical fit between antibody combining sites and antigen determinants, on the size of the area of contact between them, on the distribution of charged and hydrophobic groups, etc. Antibody affinity can be measured by equilibrium dialysis or by the kinetic BIACORE\u2122 method. The dissociation constant, Kd, and the association constant, Ka, are quantitative measures of affinity.</p>As used herein, the term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d refers to an antibody derived from a clonal population of antibody-producing cells (e.g., B lymphocytes or B cells) which is homogeneous in structure and antigen specificity. The term \u201cpolyclonal antibody\u201d refers to a plurality of antibodies originating from different clonal populations of antibody-producing cells which are heterogeneous in their structure and epitope specificity but which recognize a common antigen. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies may exist within bodily fluids, as crude preparations, or may be purified, as described herein.</p>The term \u201cbinding portion\u201d of an antibody (or \u201cantibody portion\u201d) includes one or more complete domains, e.g., a pair of complete domains, as well as fragments of an antibody that retain the ability to specifically bind to RAGE. It has been shown that the binding function of an antibody can be performed by fragments of a full-length antibody. Binding fragments are produced by recombinant DNA techniques, or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact immunoglobulins. Binding fragments include Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032)2, Fabc, Fd, dAb, Fv, single chains, single-chain antibodies, e.g., scFv, and single domain antibodies.</p>\u201cHumanized\u201d forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are h",
    "resent in a corresponding sample from a healthy control). It is understood a reference includes a concurrently run control, or a standard created by assaying one or more non-cancer cells and collecting the marker data. Thus, the control sample is optionally a standard that is created and used continuously. The standard includes, for example, the average level of a biomarker in a sample from a non-cancer control group.</p>Also provided is a method of predicting or monitoring the efficacy of an anti-cachectic agent in a subject. The method comprises acquiring a biological sample, such as tissue or bodily fluid, from the subject after administering the agent to the subject. F or example, the tissue or bodily fluid is collected from the subject 1 to 60 minutes, hours, days, or weeks after administering the agent to the subject. The method further comprises detecting levels of one or more biomarkers delineated herein (e.g., S100 family proteins). A decrease in level(s) of one or more biomarkers is evidence of treatment efficacy. Thus, a decline in said increase or time is evidence of decreasing efficacy. Thus, it is preferred that biological samples be systematically acquired over time to monitor changes in marker levels.</p>Panels and Arrays for Characterizing Pre-Cachexia or Cachexia</p>The invention provides panels for characterizing cachexia comprising the aforementioned markers. In one embodiment, the panel is present on a protein array. Protein arrays are solid-phase ligand binding assay systems using immobilized proteins on surfaces which include glass, membranes, microtiter wells, mass spectrometer plates, and beads or other particles. The assays are highly parallel (multiplexed) and often miniaturized (microarrays, protein chips). Their advantages include being rapid and automatable, capable of high sensitivity, economical on reagents, and giving an abundance of data for a single experiment. Bioinformatics support is important; the data handling demands sophisticated software and data comparison analysis. However, the software is adapted from that used for DNA arrays, as can much of the hardware and detection systems.</p>One of the chief formats for characterizing cachexia is the capture array, in which ligand-binding reagents, which are usually antibodies, but can also be alternative protein scaffolds, peptides or nucleic acid aptamers, are used to detect target molecules in mixtures such as plasma or tissue extracts. In diagnostics, capture arrays are used to carry out multiple immunoassays in parallel, both testing for several analytes in individual sera for example and testing many serum samples simultaneously. In proteomics, capture arrays are used to quantitate and compare the levels of proteins in different samples in health and disease, i.e. protein expression profiling. Proteins other than specific ligand binders are used in the array format for in vitro functional interaction screens such as protein-protein, protein-DNA, protein-dru",

(Yang et al., Stroke. 2015; 46:1328-1336.)</p>RAGE comprises a heterogeneous group of compounds formed by the Maillard chemical process, which refers to a non-enzymatic glycation of free amino groups of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, mostly, by reducing sugars and reactive aldehydes. In relation to cardiovascular diseases, elevated serum AGEs are observed in patients with coronary artery disease and thereby associated with aortic stiffness. AGEs may also induce local inflammation and intracellular ROS which all together lead to vascular alterations and the expression of a variety of atherosclerosis-related genes, including VEGF and RAGE. AGE modification of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) results in reduced LDL plasma clearance contributing significantly to increased LDL in vivo, and potentially to atherosclerosis. In aspect of the invention, compounds, and molecules which are used as a therapeuctic in cardiovascular diseases which bind to the RAGE receptor are envisioned as identifying and treating pre-cachexia (Nedic et al Free Radical Research, August 2013; 47(Suppl. 1): 28-38.)</p>A series of compounds were designed based on a large screening library capable of binding to RAGE and inhibiting the RAGE-A\u03b2 interaction in a study by Ross et al. Thirteen compounds were identified based on the highest positive binding constant which inhibit the RAGE-A\u03b2 interaction. Compounds were investigated to further identify moieties with high binding affinities to the RAGE receptor. Results showed that NTR-N1A2B1 exhibited the most promising properties and are currently being further investigated in both in vitro and in vivo studies towards the treatment Alzheimer's Disease. (Ross, N. et al. Tetrahedron 2013, 69, 7653-7658.)</p>S100 proteins are calcium-binding proteins that represent a subfamily of EF-hand proteins. Penumutchu and co-workers found additional significance of the V domain in RAGE homodimerization and signal transduction. They were able to characterize the molecular interactions between S100P and the V domain of RAGE and further identify the role of crucial residues at the interface of both proteins.
