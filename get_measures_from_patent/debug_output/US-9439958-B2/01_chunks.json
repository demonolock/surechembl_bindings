The resulting material is milled under cryogenic conditions and the powder is incorporated with other excipients into an enterically coated oral formulation, producing a tablet or capsule.</p>The tablet or capsule is then administered to a subject producing high titers of antibodies.</p>The nasal vaccines of the invention also may be prepared using the L1 protein as an antigen. Such a formulation may be prepared substantially as described above for the NoV vaccine.</p>Materials and Methods</p>The following methods and materials were used in some of the examples and embodiments described herein.</p>Preparation of Vaccine Formulations.</p>Recombinant NV VLPs were expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana by Kentucky Bioprocessing (Owensboro, Ky.) following previously described protocols [45]. Clarified leaf extracts were filtered through a 0.2 micron capsule filter and concentrated using a 100 Kd polyethersulfone (PES) tangential flow filtration (TFF) membrane (Pall Corporation, Port Washington, N.Y.). A diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) Sepharose column was used to collect a colorless fraction that allowed recovery of the VLPs in &gt;98% protein purity. Endotoxins and remaining small molecules were removed by Q Column fractionation. The resulting concentrated VLPs as a liquid solution in PBS were diluted to 10 or 25 \u03bcg NV VLPs in sterile PBS with or without 10 \u03bcg GARD (InvivoGen, San Diego, Calif.).</p>Polymer liquid formulations were prepared by mixing sterile stock solutions of 0.4% polymer liquid with PBS liquid formulations containing NV VLP with or without GARD at a 1:1 dilution in a biological hood nasal powder formulations (DelSite Biotechnologies, Inc.) were prepared by spray drying the liquid formulations using a Buchi B-290 Mini spray dryer (Buchi laboratories, Switzerland) in a temperature and moisture-controlled class 1000 clean room. The following formulations were prepared: nasal powder alone, NV VLP nasal powder, GARD nasal powder, or NV VLP nasal powder+GARD powder. All nasal powder formulations had a polymer liquid content of 0.25% (w/w). The particle size of the powder formulations was measured using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer (Beckman Coulter LS 230, Brea, Calif.) and the mean particle size was \u02dc20 \u03bcm. The powders were transferred to tight-sealed tubes and packaged in moisture and light resistant aluminum foil bags (3M\u2122, Minneapolis, Minn"
