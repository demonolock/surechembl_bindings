    "hloride or chloride-immobilization (chloride-immobilized), or their prepared product or salt prefs of polymer-bound separately; Or its aqueous solution, be used for causing cyclisation.</p>The reactant (for example, 2: 1 formula of ratio, 1 resorcinol and formula 2 phthalic anhydrides) that forms the enough stoichiometric amounts basically of cyclisation ability of formula 3a carries out.In another embodiment, can be preferably with excessive resorcinol (for example, about 2.5 equivalents to about 3 or more equivalents and more preferably from about 3.2 or more equivalents) react so that guarantee the full consumption phthalic anhydride.After separate type 3a, under agitation or not add and can the combination of consequent solid water and acetone and water combination or DMF and water preferably be heated to 50 \u2103 to 70 \u2103 and more preferably suspend again with acetone and water with stirring, to improve purity at about 60 \u2103.Can repeated isolation and suspend again and reach the purity of hope until formula 3a material.</p>The iodination reaction of preceding text step 2 can be used the excessive iodine (I of molar concentration\n        \n        \n        <sub>2</sub>) preferably under alkali condition, carry out.For example, said reaction can be carried out 0 \u2103 of temperature to backflow with 0.1-5M sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium bicarbonate or saleratus.In preferred embodiment, this reaction can be carried out in 70 \u2103-95 \u2103 with 0.4-1.0M NaOH.Can the mixture of KI, NaI or KI and NaI be used in reactant mixture, for example using the NaI of 1-2.5 equivalent with the iodine solvation.The scope in reaction time be 1-24 hour its depend on the iodine atomicity that is added to the xanthene ring system.\n      \n      \n      </p>In another embodiment, possibly control the iodate degree through changing reaction time, temperature or alkali concn.The iodine that is used for this reaction can also come original position to produce such as potassium hydrogen peroxymonosulfate or hydrogen peroxide and the iodide salt that is selected from KI, lithium iodide, sodium iodide or its some mixture with oxidant.In this special instance; Preferably avoid to cause the component of undesirable trans halogenation to be incorporated into reactant mixture; Maybe can produce other component of halide ion such as aqueous chloride solution, chlorine, HCl, only if before said component adds, removed or quencher comprises any oxidant of oxygen atmosphere and iodine.For example clorox is undesirable especially component in this reactant mixture; Reason is that it is the source of unstable chlorine anion and effective oxidant, and cl anion, chlorine residue, other hypochlorite derivative, hypochlorous acid and composition thereof also can cause undesirable side reaction in addition.When reaction is accomplished, can mixture be cooled to approximately-20 \u2103 to 10 \u2103, preferably be lower than 10 \u2103, and can add the iodine trapping agent such as sodium thiosulfate, potassium thiosulfate, ATS (Ammonium thiosulphate), potassium sulfite, sodium sulphite or its mixture quencher iodine.In preferred embodiment, carry out quencher with sodium sulphite.</p>It is possible that the formula of being easy to 3 is separated: preferably keep temperature to be lower than 10 \u2103 also with pure aqueous sulfuric acid to 1% aqueous sulfuric acid, and preferred 5% aqueous sulfuric acid conditioned reaction pH, to 5, this causes formula 3 self-dissolving liquid precipitates to come out until pH regulator to 1.5.In preferred embodiment, with pH regulator to p"
