FIG . 8 illustrates a comparison of BET bromodo ain inhibitors and CM Vatiti vitals regarding concentration and. dose-responses. </p>Example 9 </p> This example illustrates sensitivities of HCMV laboratory and clinical, strains to BET bromodomain inhibitors and current FDA-approved CMV antivirals in <sup>'</sup>fibroblast cells. </p> In these experiments, the inventors determined the 1C<sub>$</sub>{&gt; and SC&gt; &gt; values of respective BET bromodomam inhibitors against HCMV infection using fluorescence reduction assay (Fig. 9; Table 3} s. The IC<sub>\u00be</sub>\u00bb and !C&lt;<sub>?</sub>o values (drug concentrations producing 50% and 90% reduction in G.FPU) were determined by a GFP-based fluorescence reduction assay as described by Lischka, P., et al 2010. For standard assays, HFP cells were cultured in black 96- well plates (Corning, USA) and infected with recombinant laboratory-adapted strain AD169-GFP (MOI 0.3) or TR-GFP {MOI 0.3). After virus adsorption, the virus inoculum was replaced with 200 \u03bc! medium containing the respective bromodomain inhibitors or FDA- approved CMV antivirals followed by serial 2-fold dilutions. Drug concentrations were tested at least in duplicate and the drug concentrations were maintained by replaced, the medium every 24 hours. Plates were incubated at 37C for 7-8 days. The medium was replaced by 200 \u03bc! PBS, and GFP units (GFPU) were determined by a fluorescence detector (BioTek Synergy HI , USA). IC-50 and l.C values were calculated using nonlinear regression curve fit with, a variable slope (four parameters). GraphPad Prism 6 was used for the analysis. </p> The measured values are lower than, those of these compounds in Bailey et aL 201.0; Dawson et al, 201 1 ; Filippakopouios, P., et aL 2010; King et al 2013; Nicodeme et aL 2010; Picaud et al. 2 13; and Zuber et al. 201 1. </p>Example 10 </p> This example illustrates MOI dependency of HCMV infection by treatment of representative BET bromodomain inhibitor (- )-JQl . </p> IC<sub>\u00be</sub>&gt; and lCn) values (drug concentrations producing 50% and 90% reduction in GFPIJ) were determined by the fluorescence reduction, assays {<sup>'</sup>Table 4) as described by Lischka et aL 2010. For standard assays, human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells were cultured in black 96-weil plates (Corning.. USA) and infected with recombinant laboratory-adapted strains of ADi 69-GFP with, various MOIs to compare MOI dependency of (+)-JQ- l treatment.
