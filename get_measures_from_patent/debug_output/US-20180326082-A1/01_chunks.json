It is sold as a lyophilized powder for reconstitution with water prior to intramuscular administration.</p>Such existing formulations of TSH have rigid dosing regimes, require multiple, injections, have limited pharmacokinetic profiles and produce side effects, such as nausea. These shortcomings are addressed by the TSH compositions and mutated TSH compositions of the present invention. Longer-acting thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) compositions that reduce frequency of injection, provide flexible administration regimes, improve therapeutic index and have better efficacy for stimulating thyroid tissue are described herein. In addition, other potency parameters are positively affected by the longer acting TSH compositions of the invention including prolonged half life of TSH and increased duration of T4 release.</p>As shown herein, conjugating a polyalkylene glycol polymer, e.g., polyethylene glycol to TSH, beneficially altered the pharmacokinetic profile and pharmacodynamic profile of TSH. As described in greater detail below, N-terminal PEGylation, lysine PEGylation and carbohydrate polymer attachment of TSH were studied. The expectation was that N-terminal PEGylation of TSH would result in a TSH wi",
    "polymer to TSH is differentiated from the polymer being admixed, commingled, or in solution with the TSH.</p>\u201cCarbohydrate site\u201d refers to a carbohydrate side chain found on TSH. The site can be a naturally glycosylated site or a site that has been enzymatically provided. In certain embodiments, the carbohydrate site is specifically selected to meet desired criteria for optimal TSH interaction with the receptor or for other functional requirements such as folding or mobility of the protein. The carbohydrate site is available for attachment of a polymer moiety such as PEG. Typical carbohydrate sites on the protein are asparagine, serine or threonine. TSH has three asparagine-linked carbohydrate chains.</p>In certain embodiments, a single polymer is attached to TSH. In other embodiments, multiple polymers are attached the TSH. The multiple attached polymers can be of a single specie or multiple species. For example, in the case where a single PEG molecule is attached to the protein the protein is referred to as \u201cmonoPEGylated\u201d and in the case where more than one PEG molecule is attached the protein is referred to as \u201cmultiPEGylated\u201d. When the protein is multiPEGylated, an individual PEG attached to the protein (vis a vis other attached PEGs) can have the same or a different molecular weight, and can be of a linear or branched structure. The molecular weight range of the PEG molecule is 3,000-100,000 Daltons. In certain embodiments, the molecular weight of the PEG attached is 5 kD, 10 kD, 20 kD, 30 kD, 40 kD, or 60 kD or combinations thereof.</p>Provided herein are three alternative schemes for carbohydrate PEGylation of TSH: (i) sialic acid-mediated PEGylation (referred to as \u201cSAM\u201d), (ii) galactose-mediated PEGylation (referred to as \u201cGAM(\u2212)\u201d), and (iii) sialic acid removal coupled with galactose-mediated PEGylation (referred to as \u201cGAM(+)\u201d). Briefly, as shown in FIG. 3, in sialic acid mediated SAM PEGylation, the sialic acid is oxidized, followed by chemical attachment of PEG. In GAM(\u2212) PEGylation, the galactose moiety is oxidized, followed by chemical attachment of PEG. And in GAM(+), a sialic acid moiety is enzymatically removed, and the exposed galactose residue is then oxidized followed by the chemical attachment of PEG.</p>Site-specific methods of PEGylation to TSH are also included in the present invention. One such method attaches PEG to cysteine residues using cysteine-reactive PEGs. A number of highly specific, cysteine-reactive PEGs with different reactive groups (e.g., maleimide, vinylsulfone) and different size PEGs (2-40 kDa) are commercially available. At neutral pH, these PEG reagents selectively attach to \u201cfree\u201d cysteine residues, i.e., cysteine residues not involved in disulfide bonds in the target protein. Alternatively, one of two cysteines involved in a native disulfide bond may be deleted or substituted with another amino acid, leaving a native cysteine (the cysteine residue in the protein that normally would form a disulfide bond with the deleted or substituted c",
    "tose Oxidase Treatment: 2 U Catalase (Sigma 442 U/\u03bcl) per mg and 4 \u03bcg galactose oxidase (Worthington GAO, 1.2 mg/ml) per mg were added to TSH. The mixture was then incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 16 hours. After incubation the mixture was buffer-exchanged and concentrated into 100 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.6, to a final concentration of at least 5.5 mg/ml in order to perform the PEGylation.</p>PEGylation: The appropriate size aminoxy PEG (100 mg/ml in dH<sub>2</sub>O) was added to the oxidized and buffer-exchanged TSH to the (PEG:Protein) molar ratio of 1:2. The reaction volume was adjusted with 100 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.6, so that the final TSH concentration in the reaction was 5 mg/ml. The mixture was then incubated at 25\u00b0 C. for 16 hours with gentle shaking. A 50 molar excess of 0.05M hydroxylamine (m.w. 69.49) was then added to the reaction mix and incubated at 25\u00b0 C. for 6 hours with gentle shaking.</p>Example 4. N-Terminal PEGylation of rhTSHAppropriate size aldehyde PEG (100 mg/ml in reaction buffer) was added to a final concentration of 5 mg/ml rhTSH at varying (PEG:Protein) ratios in 100 mM sodium acetate, pH 5 or pH 5.6, with 20 mM sodium cyanoborohydride. Incubation was done at 25\u00b0 C. for 16 hours or 8\u00b0 C. for up to 2 days, before quenching the reaction with 0.1 volume of 1M Tris, pH 7.5, for 3 hours at 25\u00b0 C.</p>PEGylation at the N-terminus yielded conjugates that lost greater TSH receptor binding affinity than carbohydrate conjugation. N-terminal mono-PEGylation with 40 kD PEG resulted in an 11.1-fold decrease of in vitro TSH receptor binding affinity, compared to the rhTSH control.</p>Example 5. Lysine PEGylation of rhTSHAppropriate size NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide) PEG (50 mg/ml in dH<sub>2</sub>O) was added to a final concentration of 0.8 mg/ml rhTSH at varying (PEG:Protein) ratios (e.g., (0.5:1), (1;1), (2:1), (4:1), (8:1)) in PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) buffer, pH 7.2. Incubation was done at 25\u00b0 C. for 1.5 hours.</p>Lysine conjugation with N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (NHS) PEG was explored. For 40 kDa PEGS, different (PEG:protein) ratios and different incubation times were tested in the PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) buffer, pH 7.2. Final TSH concentration was 0.8 mg per ml. PEGylation was done at 25\u00b0 C. or 37\u00b0 C. for 1.5 hours or 19.5 hours. The short incubation time tested (1.5 hour) showed the same results as long incubation time (19.5 hours). This was presumably due to a rapid hydrolysis of NHS PEG in aqueous solution. The extent of PEGylation depended on the (PEG:Protein) molar ratios, with higher PEG molar excess producing more multi-PEGylated conjugates.</p>Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) fractions of mono-PEGylated species were collected and submitted for in vitro TSH receptor binding assay. In vitro TSH receptor binding assay results showed that mono-40 kDa NHS PEG-TSH (Lysine PEGylation) has 31.2-fold lower affinity than the control TSH, starting material, while mono-40 kDa aminoxy PEG-TSH (SAM PEGylation) has 5.3-fold lower affinity.</p>Example 6. Production of Cysteine Mutants for Site-Specific ConjugationTSH single mutants were designed and prepared to introduce cysteines for site-specific PEGylation. These mutants were designed to minimize its effect on protein folding, receptor binding and for their potentials to be effectively conjugated.</p>The following considerations were applied to design sites to introduce cysteine mutants based on a structural model of TSH/TSH receptor: 1) The mutation site should not be located at or adjacent to a receptor binding site; 2) The mutation site should not be located at or adjacent to an alpha/beta subunit dimerization interface; 3) The mutation site should not be located at or adjacent to a disulfide bond; 4) Avoid sites that when mutated, result in dramatic loss in specific activity based on reported literature; 5) The mutation site should be solvent exposed for subsequent PEGylation; 6) Select sites that would evenly cover most of the TSH surface opposite of the receptor binding site to fully evaluate PEGylation feasibility at each region. Some of these considerations are summarized in Table 1. The beta-carbon positions of the selected mutants were exposed to solvent in our structure model as shown in FIG. 4. This predicts that these posi",

SDS-PAGE Analysis and StainingPre-poured gradient gels (4-12% Bis Tris, Invitrogen) were loaded with 4-5 \u03bcg TSH. MOPS (3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid) running buffer (Invitrogen) was prepared. The electrophoresis apparatus was placed in an ice bucket with ice. The gel ran for approximately 50 minutes at 200V and was then rinsed three times, 5 minutes each with distilled water. 50 ml 5% barium chloride was added to the gel and then shaken for 10 minutes. The barium chloride was removed by rinsing the gel for 5 minutes with distilled water. The distilled water was then removed and the gel was first stained for PEG with 1\u00d7 potassium iodide/iodine solution until the bands were visible. The gel was then destained with distilled water and scanned immediately. For protein staining, Coomassie destain (10% acetic acid, 20% methanol) was used to remove all traces of the PEG stain and the gel was then stained with Coomassie blue stain. SDS-PAGE analysis results of purified carbohydrate PEGylated rhTSH conjugates are shown in FIG. 10C (PEG staining) and FIG. 10D (Coomassie staining).</p>Example 9. SEC-HPLC Analysis of PEGylated rhTSHSamples were run on a Superdex 200 10/300GL column (GE Healthcare) and eluted at a flow rate of 0.4 ml per min. in 50 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM sodium chloride buffer pH7. Representative SEC-HPLC profiles of the 40 kD SAM reaction and purified PEGylated rhTSH conjugates are shown in FIG. 11A and FIG. 11B, respectively.</p>Example 10. Peptide Mapping and N-Terminal Sequencing of PEGylated rhTSHTwenty micrograms of each sample was diluted into 0.1 M Tris, pH 8.5 containing 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and 38 mM dithiothreitol, overlaid with nitrogen, and incubated at 25\u00b0 C. overnight. After incubation, iodoacetamide was added at 50 mM. The samples were then overlayed with nitrogen and incubated at 25\u00b0 C. for 2 hours. The alkylation reaction was quenched by adding 1/1 (v/v) 0.25% trifluoroacetic acid and the samples were dialyzed into 0.1 M Tris, pH 8.5 using 3,500 MWCO Slide-A-Lyzer mini dialysis units (Thermo Scientific). Samples were digested with 1:25 (Enzyme:Sample) ratio overnight at 37\u00b0 C. Digest reactions were quenched with 1/1 (v/v) 0.25% trifluoroacetic acid. Trypsin-digested samples were fractionated using an Agilent 1200 HPLC equipped with an automated injector and fraction collector, a binary solvent pump, a thermostatted column compartment, and a variable wavelength detector. Samples were loaded onto a Poroshell 300SB-C8 column (2.1\u00d775 mm, 5 \u03bcm particles, Agilent Technologies, CA) that was held at 50\u00b0 C. and pre-equilibrated in 98% solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water) and 2% solvent B (0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile). Tryptic peptides were eluted using a linear gradient of solvent B from 2% to 60% over 25 min at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. PEGylated fragments, eluting at a greater % B than the un-PEGylated fragments, were collected and dried in a centrifugal concentrator (Thermo Scientific, MA). Automated N-terminal sequence analysis was performed using a Procise protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, CA). Two hundred pmol of sample and control were subjected to 18 cycles of the automated Edman degradation using the preprogrammed pulsed liquid method. FIG. 12 shows the peptide map and N-terminal sequencing results of the 40 kD SAM conjugate. Only 3 tryptic glycopeptides (AT9, AT6, BT3) were detected, indicating the site specificity of carbohydrate PEGylation. Underlined N corresponds to N-linked glycosylation site.</p>Example 11. Determination of the Relative Amount of PEGylation on Each SubunitSubunit-specific PEGylation was calculated by measuring the relative amount of unPEGylated \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits after isolating them from the PEGylated subunits, using two consecutive reversed-phase HPLC runs. This method of inference was used because chromatographic conditions that resolve PEGylated \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits could not be identified. Samples (100 \u03bcg) were concentrated to 20 \u03bcl by centrifugal ultrafiltration and then denatured in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, 10 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.0. After overnight incubation at 25\u00b0 C., the samples were loaded onto a Poroshell 300SB-C8 column (2.1\u00d775 mm, 5 \u03bcm particles, Agilent Technologies, CA) pre-equilibrated with 75% solvent A (10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.5) and 25% solvent B (40% 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 60% acetonitrile). The column was eluted with 25-50% B over 5 min followed by 50-75% B over 20 min at 0.4 ml/min at 25\u00b0 C. The peak fraction corresponding to unPEGylated TSH subunits (\u02dc9.5-12.5 min) was collected (FIG. 13B) in its entirety and concentrated to less than 50 \u03bcl by centrifugal ultrafiltration. The samples were adjusted to 50 \u03bcl with water and then reduced by addition of 4.7 \u03bcl of 2 M dithiothreitol and 150 \u03bcl of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1 M Tris, pH 8.5, overlayed with nitrogen and incubated at 25\u00b0 C. overnight. Free thiols were then alkylated by adding 9.3 \u03bcl of 2 M iodoacetamide, overlaying with nitrogen, and incubating for 2 hr at 25\u00b0 C. The alkylation reaction was quenched by adding 150 \u03bcl of 0.25% trifluoroacetic acid. Reduced and alkylated unPEGylated TSH subunits were profiled by the second reversed-phase HPLC run. The HPLC column setup was identical to that indicated above with the exception that solvent A consisted of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and solvent B consisted of 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile and the column was held at 50\u00b0 C. The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 2-75% B in 15 min at 0.3 ml/min. The relative percentage of unPEGylated \u03b1 vs. \u03b2 subunits was determined by integration of the resulting A214 nm chromatograms (FIG. 13C) from triple injections per sample. The relative percentage of PEGylated \u03b1 vs. \u03b2 subunits was then taken as the inverse of these values. This analysis showed the fraction of \u03b1-subunit modified in the 40 kD monoPEGylated GAM\u2212, GAM+ and SAM conjugates to be 77%, 66%, and 58%, respectively, in agreement with the results obtained by SDS-PAGE (FIG. 13A).</p>Example 12. In Vitro Receptor Binding AssayPurified PEGylated conjugates were analyzed by in vitro porcine TSH receptor binding assay using the TSH Receptor Autoantibody 2nd Generation ELISA kit from RSR Limited (Kronus, Star, Id.). Instead of using the biotinylated human monoclonal autoantibody to the TSH receptor provided by the kit, we biotinylated Thyrogen\u00ae (rhTSH) to use for competitive inhibition of binding to TSH receptor. Binding of biotinylated rhTSH to immobilized porcine TSH receptor was inhibited by either rhTSH control or PEGylated rhTSH conjugates and IC<sub>50 </sub>values were measured.</p>Thyrogen\u00ae was biotinylated with 1.7 to 1.8 biotins per protein using the ChromaLink\u2122 Biotin Labeling Reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (QED Bioscience Inc., San Diego, Calif.) and buffer exchanged into 50 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM sodium chloride pH 7.0 with a Zeba\u2122 Desalt Spin Column (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, Ill.). In vitro measurement of receptor binding was performed by competition of biotinylated Thyrogen\u00ae and PEG-rhTSH conjugate for binding to porcine TSH receptor immobilized onto 96-well plates supplied with the TSH Receptor Autoantibody 2<sup>nd </sup>Generation ELISA kit from RSR Limited (Kronus, Star, Id.). PEG-rhTSH conjugates were serially diluted 1:5 from 16 \u03bcM to 41 pM in assay buffer (100 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 20 mM EDTA, 1% BSA, 0.5% Triton X-100) and mixed 1:1 with biotinylated Thyrogen\u00ae diluted 1000-fold in assay buffer. The mixture was added to each receptor-coated well and incubated at 25\u00b0 C. for 25 minutes. Unbound rhTSH was washed away and streptavidin peroxidase was added at 25\u00b0 C. for 20 minutes according to the RSR Limited ELISA protocol to determine the amount of biotinylated Thyrogen\u00ae bound to the plate. The plate was then washed three times to remove excess unbound streptavidin peroxidase and then tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) was added to each well and incubated in the dark at 25\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes. The reaction which was quenched with 0.5M sulfuric acid stop buffer and the absorbance of each well was read at 450 nm using a SpectraMax\u00ae 340pc plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.). The data was fit using a sigmoidal dose response equation with GraphPad Prism software to generate IC<sub>50 </sub>values.</p>N-terminus and lysine PEGylation yielded conjugates with lower TSH receptor affinity than carbohydrate conjugation. N-terminal mono-PEGylation with 40 kD PEG resulted in 10.8-fold lower receptor binding affinity compared to the TSH control. Lysine-PEGylation with 40 kD PEG resulted in 31.2-fold lower receptor binding affinity compared to the TSH control. In contrast, GAM+ mono-PEGylation resulted in 2.2-fold lower receptor binding affinity for 20 kD PEG conjugation and 3.6-fold lower receptor binding affinity for 40 kD PEG conjugation. SAM mono-PEGylation also resulted in moderate decrease in in vitro TSH receptor binding affinity compared to N-terminal PEGylation, ranging from 2.1- to 5.3-fold decrease, depending on the size of PEG conjugated. GAM(\u2212) mono-PEGylation caused the greatest loss among all the carbohydrate PEGylation strategies, with 20 kD PEG conjugation causing 2.7-fold decrease and 40 kD PEG conjugation, 8.0-fold decrease in in vitro TSH receptor binding affinity.

Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Analysis of PEGylated rhTSH in Male and Female Sprague Dawley Rats Following a Single Intramuscular (IM) InjectionThe pharmacokinetics of rhTSH and PEGylated rhTSH (20 kD SAM, 20 kD GAM(\u2212), 20 kD GAM(+), 40 kD GAM(+)) was evaluated in male and female rats following a single intramuscular (IM) injection.</p>A single dose of rhTSH or PEGylated rhTSH (20 kD SAM, 20 kD GAM(\u2212), 20 kD GAM(+), 40 kD GAM(+)) was administered IM to fasted male and female jugular vein cannulated rats at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg. Due to dose volume limitations, animals received test articles in the form of two or three intramuscular injections into quadriceps muscle. Legs were alternated for dosing. Blood samples were collected from the animals pre-dose and at the following post-dosage time points: 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48 hours. Food was removed from the animal cages on the evening prior to test article administration. Animals had access to water during this time. Food was added back to cages following pre-dose sample collections and test article administration. Food was removed again at the end of the day such that animals were fasted for the 24 hour post-dose sample collection. Food was added back to cages following sample collection and removed again at the end of the day such that animals were fasted for the 48 hour post-dose sample collection.

Due to dose volume limitations, animals received test articles in the form of two or three intramuscular injections into quadriceps muscle. Legs were alternated for dosing. Blood samples were from the animals pre-dose and at the following post-dosage time points: 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours.

The Tmax of rhTSH occurred at 6 hours post-dose and returned to baseline (i.e., vehicle group levels) by 72 hour post-dose. 10 KD multiSAM Tmax occurred at 24 hours post-dose and returned to baseline at 72 hours post-dose for 0.04 mg/kg dose and 96 hours post-dose for 0.4 mg/kg dose. Low dose data showed decreased potency of 10 KD multiSAM relative to rhTSH in this model, which may reflect decreased TSH receptor binding affinity. High dose data confirmed enhanced pharmacodynamic effects with 10 KD multiSAM at 48 and 72 hours post-dose. All candidates including 40 kD multiSAM and 50 kD multiSAM showed enhanced T4 response compared to rhTSH at 0.4 mg/kg, which might have been in part mediated by shift in Tmax to 24 hours post-dose. Prolonged pharmacodynamic activity was observed through 96-120 hours post-dose. (For 40 kD multiSAM and 50 kD multiSAM, 0.65 mg/kg dose equaled to 0.4 mg/kg based on the percentage content of monoPEGylated species in these conjugates.) For all test articles, approximately 95% of the pharmacodynamic effects were observed within 96 hours post-dose following intramuscular administration. Higher AUECs observed with PEGylated conjugates is driven by higher T4 levels between 24-96 hours post-dose.

Pharmacodynamic Assessment of PEGylated rhTSH (10 KD MultiSAM and 40 KD SAM)The pharmacodynamics of PEGylated rhTSH (10 KD MultiSAM and 40 KD SAM) was evaluated in male and female rats following a single intramuscular (IM) injection, three days post T3 pellet implantation.</p>Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane and a 1.5 mg T3 pellet (T-261, Innovative Research of America) was implanted subcutaneously using a trochar. At three days post pellet implantation, a single dose of vehicle or PEGylated rhTSH (10 KD MultiSAM or 40 KD SAM) was administered IM to male and female jugular vein cannulated rats at a dose of 0.0 mg/kg (vehicle), 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, or 1.0 mg/kg as specified in Table 15. Due to dose volume limitations, animals received test articles in the form of two intramuscular injections into the quadriceps muscle. Legs were alternated for dosing. Blood samples were collected from the animals pre-dose and at the following post-dosage time points: 6, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 168 hours. Blood was collected from the single port jugular cannula. Approximately 250 \u03bcl of whole blood was collected into serum separator tubes and the blood was allowed to clot for a minimum of 30 minutes. Tubes were spun in a centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 5 minutes and the serum was separated into two tubes (\u02dc50 \u03bcl each). All samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. until they were analyzed for T4 concentrations by the ACE clinical chemistry T4 assay. Following the last sample collection animals were euthanized with CO<sub>2</sub>.

(See FIG. 23). 10 KD multiSAM did not produce a maximum PD response at 0.4 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg resulted in more pronounced T4 responses (in degree and duration). 40 KD SAM 0.2 mg/kg exhibited a moderate PD response while 0.1 mg/kg had little or no effect. Interestingly, 10 KD multiSAM and 40 KD SAM exhibited nearly identical PD at 0.2 mg/kg. At 0.4 mg/kg, however, 40 kD SAM elicited a stronger pharmacodynamic effect than 10 kD multiSAM. Overall, the data from three separate studies (Examples 18, 19 and 20) are consistent for 10 kD multiSAM and 40 kD SAM.</p>Example 21.
