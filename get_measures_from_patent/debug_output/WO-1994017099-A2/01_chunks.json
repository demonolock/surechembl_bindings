The thymocytes were plated into 96-well microtiter plates at 10<sup>6</sup> cells/well (150 \u03bcl) . The cells were activated with 1.0 \u03bcg/ml of phytohemagglutinin and 8 units/ml of interleukin-1 (IL-1) (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) . 0.02 to 200 pmol of the peptides or 0.02 to 50 fmol of TGF-/82 were added and the total volume was adjusted to 250 \u03bcl with the culture medium. The cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 72 hr in a humidified incubator in 5% C0<sub>2</sub>-95% air atmosphere. The cells were pulsed with 0.5 \u03bcCi/well of <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine 24 hours prior to cell harvest. The thymocytes were harvested onto glass fiber filters and dried. The amount of <sup>3</sup>H- thymidine incorporation was determined by liquid scintillation counting method.</p>The results obtained indicated that TGF-/82 inhibited incorporation of <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine into the DNA of murine thymocytes with an ED<sub>50</sub> of approximately 4 pM. The TGF-/32<sub>16</sub>_<sub>47</sub> dimer was also active as an inhibitor of thymocyte proliferation in this assay with an ED<sub>50</sub> of 57 nM. However, both TGF-3l<sub>16</sub>_<sub>31</sub> dimer and <sup>T</sup>GF-S2<sub>1</sub>g_<sub>31</sub> \n\ndimer did not affect <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine incorporation at concentrations up to 0.8 \u03bcM.</p>Example 4 - TGF-\u03b8 receptor binding assay Rat muscle myoblasts (L6, American Type Culture</p>Collection) were plated in 6-well culture plates and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 10% FBS until the cells were 70-90% confluent. Medium was aspirated from the wells; and 1 ml of ice cold 20 mM glycine, 135 mM NaCl, pH 3.0 was added to each well for 2 min. The buffer was aspirated and each well was rinsed 2 times with 1 ml of DMEM, 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.1% BSA. Samples of TGF-01 and TGF-/32 (3 to 1600 pM) and of peptides (0.1 to 30 \u03bcM) , each containing 25 pM <sup>125</sup>I-TGF- \u03b2l or <sup>125</sup>I-TGF-S2 were prepared in DMEM, 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.1% BSA and added in 500 \u03bcl aliquots to the wells. Radiolabeled TGF-3 samples (500 \u03bcl) either without unlabeled TGF-/3 or with excess unlabeled TGF-S (20-25 nM) were prepared and added to other wells. After 1 hr incubation at room temperature, each well was rinsed 2 times with 1 ml of Hank's balanced saline solution, 0.1% BSA. To each well, 500 \u03bcl of 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.01% BSA was added and incubated at 37\u00b0C with rotation for 30 min to lyse the cells. Samples were transferred into gamma-counting vials and counted for 1 min each. The results are presented in Table 2. \n\n</p>Table 2</p>Ability of the peptides to compete against binding of <sup>125</sup>I-TGF-0 to L6 rat muscle myoblasts</p>p\u00a7ptide <sup>125</sup>I-TGF-\u03b2 ID<sub>50</sub></p>TGF-01 TGF-01 10-30 pM</p>TGF-02 TGF-02 100-130 pM</p>TGF-01<sub>16</sub>. -31 dimer TGF-01, TGF- <sup>\u25a0</sup>02 10-15 \u03bcM monomer TGF-01, TGF-<sup>\u25a0</sup>02 not active</p>TGF-01-.g. -47 dimer TGF-01 not active monomer TGF-01 not active</p>TGF-02<sub>16</sub>. <sup>\u25a0</sup>31 dimer TGF-02 30 \u03bcM monomer TGF-02 not active</p>TGF-02<sub>16</sub>. -47 dimer TGF-02 3 \u03bcM monomer TGF-02 30 \u03bcM</p>The results obtained indicate that TGF-01 competed against binding of <sup>1 5</sup>I-TGF-01, and TGF-02 competed against binding of <sup>125</sup>I-TGF-02 for L6 rat muscle myoblasts, as previously reported by Segarini et al., J. Biol. Chem., 262:14655-14662 (1987). From the competitive binding data, the apparent dissociation constants were estimated to be 10-30 pM for TGF-01 and 100-130 pM for TGF-02.
