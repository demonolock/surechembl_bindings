The formulation characteristics tested included particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), encapsulation % and storage stability.</p>LNPs having various molar concentrations of PEG<sub>2000</sub>-DMG (0 to 5 mol %) were prepared as described in the Materials and Methods. The nucleic acid cargo was plasmid DNA (pDNA) or mRNA encoding for firefly luciferase and the N/P for each formulation was 9.

    "eatment with CD4+ and CD8+ cells at a dose of 2.5 \u03bcg.</p>As can be seen in FIG. 29A, the unshielded lcLNP\u2122 (PEG-less) with Cas9 and TRAC gRNA showed reductions in TCR signal for both CD4+ and CD8+ human T cells. The percentage knock-out (KO) of TCR and CD3 relative to the untreated cells was around 90% for CD4+ cells and around 70% for CD8+ cells (FIG. 29B).</p>Example 21: Ex Vivo LNP-Mediated Knock-In of Primary T CellsGiven the successful knock-out of the TRAC locus achieved in the previous examples, the inventors next investigated LNP-mediated knock-in of eGFP in the TRAC locus of CD4+ T cells. The LNP formulations examined were as follows: lcLNP\u2122 PEG-less:ionizable lipid 15:DSPC:Chol (28.15:50:21.85) The LNP cargo was Cas9 mRNA:TCR gRNA (1:1 wt:wt) for knock-out only (control) or Cas9 mRNA:TCR gRNA:GFP homology directed repair (HDR) DNA (1:1:3 wt:wt) for the knock-out/knock-in studies. The cut site in the TRAC exon 1 is depicted in FIG. 30A, as well as the HDR template comprising a sequence encoding GFP flanked by left homology arm (LHA) and right homology arm (RHA) sequences. The knock-out and knock-out/knock-in studies were carried out as set forth in the Materials and Methods.</p>The results are shown in FIGS. 30B-E. Un-transfected T cells were primarily of the wild-type phenotype as measured by flow cytometry (FIG. 30B). The T cells treated with LNPs having only knock-out cargo, Cas9 mRNA:TCR gRNA, exhibited 91% knock out (FIG. 30C). The knock-out/knock-in sample (KO+KI) treated with LNPs having Cas9 mRNA:TCR gRNA:GFP HDR DNA exhibited 75% knock-out and 7% knock-in (FIG. 30D), while the same knock-out/knock-in sample treated with NHEJ inhibitor M3814 exhibited 75% knock-out and 11% knock-in (FIG. 30E).</p>Example 22: Expression of mRNA in HSPC Bone Marrow Cell Subsets Using Unshielded High DSPC LNPsThe effect of eliminating PEG<sub>2000</sub>-DMG on eGFP expression in LNPs was evaluated in bone marrow haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in vivo. Unexpectedly, such unshielded lcLNP\u2122 formulations exhibited improved eGFP relative to a baseline formulation comprising PEG-lipid.</p>In particular, the following luciferase control and eGFP mRNA LNP formulations comprising ionizable lipid (as indicated), DSPC and cholesterol were compared in this example (Table 20, LNPs 1, 3 and 4) to the PEG-containing control, which was Onpattro\u2122 baseline (LNP 2). The luciferase and uLNP\u2122 formulations lacking PEG were prepared by a modified method in which, after T-mixing, buffer was added to the formulation mixture in increasing ratios of LNP:1\u00d7 buffer prior to dialysis and gently mixed, followed by transfer to dialysis in 1\u00d7PBS followed by processing as usual.</p>TABLE 20Unshielded formulations (uLNP) examined in vivo containing eGFP mRNAIonizable lipidcitationPercent(incorporated byGroupSampleDSPCLipid composition/mol %reference)1Luc control40 mol %Ionizable lipidWO 2022/2465711:DSPC:Chol: (20:40:40)(norMC3)2Benchmark10 mol %Ionizable lipidWO 20"
