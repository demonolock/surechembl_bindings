    "ts or transcription factors involved in the maintenance of stem cell development and PCBP1) are incorporated into a vector system for gene therapy to directly induce conversion of cells into stem cell-like cells for the treatment of disease. These features provide a minimal potential for involving tumorigenic pathways that may be otherwise activated during stem cell development.</p>Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein 1 (PCBP1)In some aspects, the present disclosure provides a vector containing the transcription factor Poly(rC)-binding protein 1 (PCBP1, also known as hnRNP-E1 and \u03b1CP1) which can inhibit or delay tumorigenesis. In some embodiments, the PCBP1 is a mammalian PCBP1. In some embodiments, the PCBP1 is human PCBP1, fragment, or variant thereof.</p>In some embodiments, PCBP1 alters the expression of one or more cancer biomarkers. In some embodiments, the cancer biomarker is a breast cancer biomarker. In some embodiments, the cancer biomarker is a prostate cancer biomarker. In some embodiments, the cancer biomarker is a lung cancer biomarker. In some embodiments, the expression of one or more cancer biomarkers is increased. In some embodiments, the expression of one or more cancer biomarkers is decreased. In some embodiments, the cancer biomarker is associated with metastasis. In some embodiments, the cancer biomarker includes, but is not limited to, PRL-3, STAT3, CD44 variant, CD133, CD24, Estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER2, CA27, CA29, CA25, CEA, CA125, Ki-67, ER\u03b1, Cyclin D1, Cyclin E, ER\u03b2, PSA, PCA3, AR-V7, E-cadherin, and vimentin. In some embodiments, transfection of a cancer cell with the constructs of the present disclosure decreases expression of CD44. In some embodiments, transfection of a cancer cell with the constructs of the present disclosure decreases expression of CD133. In some embodiments, the PCBP1 is a nucleic acid. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid is DNA. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid is RNA. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid is mRNA. In some embodiments, the PCBP1 contains the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1. In some embodiments, the PCBP1 is the full-length nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1. In some embodiments, the PCBP1 is a fragment of the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1. In some embodiments, the PCBP1 is a variant of the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1. Without being bound by theory, each of the KH domains within PCBP1 has been shown to bind to mRNAs of different proteins, and use of one or more KH domain may selectively inhibit the translation of a given protein. In some embodiments, the PCBP1 nucleic acid encodes all three K-homologous (KH) domains. In some embodiments, the PCPB1 nucleic acid encodes two KH domains. In some embodiments, the PCPB1 nucleic acid encodes one KH domain.</p>Further, mutations in a nuclear localization signal may alter the ability of PCBP1 to translocate into the nucleus, and thus affect later gene expression. In some embodiments, the"
