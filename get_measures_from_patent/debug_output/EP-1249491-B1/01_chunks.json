    "ure medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the\nunfused, immortalized cells. For example, if the parental cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine\nphosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include\nhypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (\"HAT medium\"), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient\ncells.</p>\n  Preferred immortalized cell lines are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high level expression of\nantibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. More\npreferred immortalized cell lines are murine myeloma lines, which can be obtained, for instance, from the Salk\nInstitute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, California and the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville,\nMaryland. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the\nproduction of human monoclonal antibodies [Kozbor, J. Immunol., 133:3001 (1984); Brodeur et al., Monoclonal\nAntibody Production Techniques and Applications, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, (1987) pp. 51-63].</p>\n  The culture medium in which the hybridoma cells are cultured can then be assayed for the presence of\nmonoclonal antibodies directed against the PRO polypeptide of interest. Preferably, the binding specificity of\nmonoclonal antibodies produced by the hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro\nbinding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). Such\ntechniques and assays are known in the art. The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example,\nbe determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson and Pollard, Anal. Biochem., 107:220 (1980).</p>\n  After the desired hybridoma cells are identified, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution\nprocedures and grown by standard methods [Goding, supra]. Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for\nexample, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium and RPMI-1640 medium. Alternatively, the hybridoma cells may \nbe grown in vivo as ascites in a mammal.</p>\n  The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones may be isolated or purified from the culture medium\nor ascites fluid by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose,\nhydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography.</p>\n  The monoclonal antibodies may also be made by recombinant DNA methods, such as those described\nin U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567. DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be readily isolated\nand sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding\nspecifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The hybridoma cells of the\ninvention serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be placed"
