    "rminal methionine from nascent polypeptides (Bradshaw, et al (1998) Trends Biochem. Sci. 23, 263) and to associate with eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF-2\u03b1) to prevent its phosphorylation (Ray, et al. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, 539). Both the genes of human and rat MetAP2 were cloned and have shown 92% sequence identity (Wu,. et al. (1993) J Biol. Chem. 268, 10796; Li, X. &amp; Chang, Y.-H (1996) Biochem. &amp; Biophys. Res. Comm. 227, 152). The N-terminal extension in these enzymes is highly charged and consists of two basic polylysine blocks and one aspartic acid block, which has been speculated to be involved in the binding of eIF-2\u03b1 (Gupta, et al. (1993) in Translational Regulation of Gene Expression 2 (Ilan, J., Ed.), pp. 405-431, Plenum Press, New York). </p> The anti-angiogenic compounds, fumagillin and its analogs, have been shown to specifically block the exo-aminopeptidase activity of hMetAP2 without interfering with the formation of the hMetAP2: erF2\u03b1 complex (Griffith, et al., (1997) Chem. Biol. 4, 461; Sin, et al. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 94, 6099). Fumagillin and its analogs inactivate the enzymatic activity of hMetAP2 with a high specificity, which is underscored by the lack of effect of these compounds on the closely related type 1 methionine aminopeptidase (MetAP1) both in vitro and in vivo in yeast (Griffith, et al., (1997) Chem. Biol. 4, 461; Sin, et al. (1997) Proc.Natl.Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 94, 6099). The extremely high potency (IC50&lt;1 nM) of these inhibitors appears to be due to the irreversible modification of the active site residue, His231, of hMetAP2 (Liu, et al. (1998) Science 282, 1324). Disturbance of MetAP2 activity in vivo impairs the normal growth of yeast (Griffith, et al., (1997) Chem. Biol. 4, 461; Sin, et al. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 94, 6099; In-house data) as well as Drosophila (Cutforth &amp; Gaul (1999) Mech. Dev. 82, 23). Most significantly, there appears to be a clear correlation between the inhibition effect of fumagillin related compounds against the enzymatic activity of hMetAP2 in vitro and the suppression effect of these compounds against tumor-induced angiogenesis in vivo (Griffith, et al., (1997) Chem. Biol. 4, 461). </p> Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the U.S., exceeded only by heart disease. Despite recent successes in therapy against some forms of neoplastic disease, other forms continue to be refractory to treatment. Thus, cancer remains a leading cause of death and morbidity in the United States and elsewhere (Bailar and Gornik (1997) N Engl J Med 336, 1569). Inhibition of hMetAP2 provides a promising mechanism for the development of novel anti-angiogenic agents in the treatment of cancers. It has now been discovered that compounds of formula (I) and (IA) are effective inhibitors of hMetAP2, and thus would be useful in treating conditions mediated by hMetAP2. </p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  In one aspect, the present invention is to a nove"
