The BTK-Eu complex was incubated on ice one hour prior to use at a starting concentration of 50 nM BTK-Bioease\u2122: 10 nM Eu-streptavidin (Perkin-Elmer Catalog#AD0062). The assay buffer consisted of 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.15), 0.1 mM DTT, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mg/ml BSA with 3% Kinase Stabilizer (Fremont Biosolutions, Catalog #STB-K02). After 1 h, the reaction mixture from above was diluted 10 fold in assay buffer to make 5 nM BTK: 1 nM Eu-Streptavidin complex (donor fluorophore). 18 \u03bcl of a mixture of 0.11 nM BTK-Eu and 0.11 nM Kinase Tracer 178 (Invitrogen, Catalog #PV5593,) with BTK-Eu alone as no negative control, was then dispensed into 384-well flat bottom plates (Greiner, 784076). Compounds to be tested in assay were prepared as 10\u00d7 concentrations and serial dilution in half-log increments was performed in DMSO so as to generate 10 point curves. To initiate the FRET reaction, compounds prepared as 10\u00d7 stock in DMSO was added to the plates and the plates were incubated 18-24 h at 14\u00b0 C.</p>After the incubation the plates were read on a BMG Pherastar Fluorescent plate reader (or equivalent) and used to measure the emission energy from the europium donor fluorophore (620 nm emission) and the FRET (665 nm emission). The negative control well values were averaged to obtain the mean minimum. The positive \u201cno inhibitor\u201d control wells were averaged to obtain the mean maximum. Percent of maximal FRET was calculated using following equation:\n\n% max FRET=100\u00d7[(FSR cmpd\u2212FSR mean min)/(FSR mean max\u2212FSR mean min)]\n</p>where FSR=FRET Signal ratio. % Max FRET curves were plotted in Activity Base (Excel) and the IC50(%), hill slope, z\u2032 and % CV were determined. The mean IC50 and standard deviation will be derived from duplicate curves (singlet inhibition curves from two independent dilutions) using Microsoft Excel.</p>Representative compound data for this assay are listed below in Table II.</p>TABLE IICompoundIC<sub>50 </sub>(\u03bcM)I-10.0068I-20.0046I-30.025I-40.012I-50.0023I-60.043I-70.0026I-80.01443I-90.22I-100.18I-110.2I-120.013I-130.53I-140.00046I-150.00082I-160.0036I-170.0035I-180.0052I-190.0068I-200.15I-21&gt;100I-220.0013I-23&gt;100I-240.035I-250.074I-260.014I-270.0037I-280.0069I-290.0043I-300.0061I-310.029I-320.022I-330.43I-340.0251I-350.0018I-360.005I-370.05I-380.15I-390.024I-400.023I-410.052I-420.13I-430.0013I-440.008I-450.0017I-460.0042I-470.032I-480.0032I-490.0014I-500.0025I-510.0011I-520.017I-530.0017I-540.0029I-550.0051I-560.0031I-570.0033I-580.0021I-590.0120</p>Inhibition of B Cell Activation in Whole Blood Measured by CD69 Expression</p>A procedure to test the ability of Btk inhibitors to suppress B cell receptor-mediated activation of B cells in human blood is as follows:</p>Human whole blood (HWB) is obtained from healthy volunteers, with the following restrictions: 24 hr drug-free, non-smokers. Blood is collected by venipuncture into Vacutainer tubes anticoagulated with sodium heparin. Test compounds are diluted to ten times the desired starting drug concentration in PBS (20\u00d7), followed by three-fold serial dilutions in 10% DMSO in PBS to produce a nine point dose-response curve. 5.5 \u03bcl of each compound dilution is added in d",

Included are induced control, unstained and single stains for compensation adjustments and initial voltage settings. Samples are then lysed with 1 mL of 1\u00d7 Pharmingen Lyse Buffer (BD Pharmingen #555899), and plates are centrifuged at 1800 rpm for 5 minutes. Supernatants are removed via suction and the remaining pellets are lysed again with another 1 mL of 1\u00d7 Pharmingen Lyse Buffer, and plates are spun down as before. Supernatants are aspirated and remaining pellets are washed in FACs buffer (PBS+1% FBS). After a final spin, the supernantants are removed and pellets are resuspended in 180 \u03bcL of FACs buffer. Samples are transferred to a 96 well plate suitable to be run on the HTS 96 well system on the BD LSR II flow cytometer.</p>Using appropriate excitation and emission wavelengths for the fluorophores used, data are acquired and percent positive cell values are obtained using Cell Quest Software. Results are initially analyzed by FACS analysis software (Flow Jo). The IC50 for test compounds is defined as the concentration which decreases by 50% the percentage of CD69-positive cells that are also CD20-positive after stimulation by anti-IgM (average of 8 control wells, after subtraction of the average of 8 wells for the no-stimulus background). The IC50 values are calculated using XLfit software version 3, equation 201.</p>Inhibition of B-Cell Activation\u2014B Cell FLIPR Assay in Ramos Cells Inhibition of B-cell activation by compounds of the present invention is demonstrated by determining the effect of the test compounds on anti-IgM stimulated B cell responses.</p>The B cell FLIPR assay is a cell based functional method of determining the effect of potential inhibitors of the intracellular calcium increase from stimulation by an anti-IgM antibody. Ramos cells (human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line. ATCC-No. CRL-1596) were cultivated in Growth Media (described below). One day prior to assay, Ramos cells were resuspended in fresh growth media (same as above) and set at a concentration of 0.5\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>cells/mL in tissue culture flasks.</p>On day of assay, cells are counted and set at a concentration of 1\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>cells/mL in growth media supplemented with 1 \u03bcM FLUO-3AM (TefLabs Cat-No. 0116, prepared in anhydrous DMSO and 10% Pluronic acid) in a tissue culture flask, and incubated at 37\u00b0 C.
