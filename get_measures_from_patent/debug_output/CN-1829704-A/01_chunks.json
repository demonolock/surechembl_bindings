    "20pM[of cumulative volume 150 \u03bc L<sup>125</sup>I]-BH-CCK-8S (50 \u03bc L 60pM solution) incubation. [<sup>125</sup>I]-there be lower the detection in the 15 \u03bc L buffer A that are combined in fully of BH-CCK-8S. [<sup>125</sup>I]-non-specific binding of BH-CCK-8S detects in the presence of 15 \u03bc L, 10 \u03bc M YF476, YF476 be with radioligand [<sup>125</sup>I]-the incoherent CCK-2 receptor-selective of BH-CCK-8S structure antagonist. To analyze preparation at 21 \u00b1 3 \u2103 of incubation 1h, then by decompression fast filtering preparation termination analysis. Then the filter of carrying adds filter plate with 100 \u03bc L scintillation solutions with undiluted PBS (100 \u03bc L) washing three times. Detect binding radioactivity, gate time 1min with Topcount (Packard BioScience, Meriden, CT). According to these experiments, select 1 sediment cell concentration of 15mL buffer solution to be used for other analysis. In order to confirm radioligand concentration and the incubative time of described analysis, also saturated and dynamics combination are studied (referring to M.F.Morton, The Pharmacological Characterization of Cholecystokinin Receptors in the Human Gastrointestinal Tract.PhD Thesis, University of London, 2000). With film preparation with the competitive parts of 15 \u03bc L (0.1pM-1mM) at 21 \u00b1 3 \u2103 of incubation 60min, estimate the affinity of noval chemical compound. Then according to the said method termination analysis.</p>Data analysis</p>With Y.-C.Cheng and W.H.Prusoff equation determine the pKi value (Biochem.
