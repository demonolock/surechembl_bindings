    " M2 protein. Fully human monoclonal IgGl antibodies have been generated from representative scFv clones. Human, and in particular fully human antibodies, are advantageous because they show less severe side effects when administered to a human subject. Without being bound to any theory this is because human, and in particular fully human, antibodies are typically and preferably not recognized by the human immune system. It has surprisingly been found that the selected antibody clones show different combinations of identical and/or highly similar CDR sequences in their light chain variable regions (LCVR) and in their heavy chain variable regions (HCVR). Based on the particular combination of CDRs, different types of LCVRs and HCVRs can be distinguished (cf. Tables 1 and 2). However, the LCVRs and HCVRs of all clones are highly similar as can be deduced from the sequence information which is provided in Tables 1 and 2. It was therefore concluded that the antibodies of the invention are clonally related. Table 3 provides an overview of the different combinations of LCVR and HCVR \n\n types as defined by their CDRs which were found in the selected clones. The table also indicates the abundance of each of these combinations among the 53 clones. Further surprisingly it has been found that the antibodies of the invention show a very high affinity towards influenza M2e antigen, and in particular towards the extracellular domain of the influenza A M2 protein. The dissociation constants (Kd) between the antibodies and RNAse - influenza A M2e antigen conjugate was found to be in the low picomolar range. An epitope mapping revealed that the minimal epitope which is recognized by antibody clone D005 is comprised in the amino acid sequence LLTEVETP (SEQ ID NO:93). This epitope is comprised by the M2 protein of most known influenza A strains. Consequently, it has been found, that the antibodies of the invention show a similarly high affinity to different variants of the extracellular domain of influenza A M2 protein which are derived from different strains of influenza A virus. It has also been demonstrated that the antibodies of the invention are specifically binding to cells which are expressing recombinant influenza A M2 protein on their surface. Moreover, antibodies of the invention were found to exhibit a preferential binding to cell-associated influenza A M2 protein. Furthermore it was found that antibodies of the invention are capable of specifically binding influenza A M2 protein in the context of influenza A virus particles. Most importantly, it has been demonstrated in a mouse model for influenza A virus infection that the antibodies of the invention are highly effective in the treatment and/or prevention of influenza A virus infection. Contrary to other influenza A M2 specific human antibodies which are known in the art, the antibodies of the invention have therapeutic activity when administered as a single dose on day one or day two after infection. The antibodies disclosed herein are therefore useful as a medicament against influenza A virus infection in a therapeutic as well as in a prophylactic setting. \n\n</p>Table 1: CDRs of the LCVRs of fully human M2 specific monoclonal antibodies. Nine types of LCVRs can be distinguished based on the combination of their CDR sequences (IA to 3B). Based on sequence similarities in the LC CDRs 3 groups of LCVRs can be distinguished: IA to IE, 2A to 2B, and 3 A to 3B).</p></p>Table 2: CDRs of the HCVRs of fully human M2 specific monoclonal antibodies. Six types of HCVRs can be distinguished based on the combination of their CDR sequences.</p>\n Table 3: Combination of LCVRs and HCVRs as occurring in 53 independent clones of fully human M2 specific monoclonal antibodies.

The specificity of this interaction between the antibody and the antigen (affinity) is characterized by a binding constant or, inversely, by a dissociation constant (Kd). It is to be understood that the apparent affinity of an antibody to an antigen depends on the structure of the antibody and of the antigen, and on the actual assay conditions. The apparent affinity of an antibody to an antigen in a multivalent interaction may be significantly higher than in a monovalent interaction due to avidity. Thus, affinity is \n\n preferably determined under conditions favoring monovalent interactions. Kd can be determined by methods known in the art. Preferably, Kd of a given combination of antibody and antigen is determined by Friguet ELISA essentially as described (Friguet B. et al, 1985, J. Immunol. Meth. 77, 305-319), wherein a constant amount of purified antibody, for example scFv or Fab fragment, is contacted with a serial dilution of a known concentration of antigen.

The affinity of a given combination of antibody and antigen may also be determined by ELISA, wherein a constant amount of immobilized antigen is contacted with a serial dilution of a known concentration of a purified antibody, preferably a scFv or Fab fragment. The affinity is then determined as the concentration of the antibody where half-maximal binding is observed (EC50). Very preferably, EC50 of an antibody and an immobilized antigen is determined by ELISA, wherein preferably said antibody is an scFv antibody, most preferably a scFv-msFc\u03b32c fusion, and wherein further preferably said antigen is an influenza M2e antigen, wherein preferably said influenza M2e antigen comprises or preferably consists of the peptide of any one of SEQ ID NOs 48 to 83, most preferably of the peptide of SEQ ID NO:48.

In a very preferred embodiment said ELISA is performed as described in the first paragraph of Example 4 herein. Alternatively, Kd of an interaction of an antibody and an antigen is determined by Biacore analysis as the ratio of on rate (Ic<sub>0n</sub>) and off rate (k<sub>o</sub>ff). Kd may also be determined by equilibrium dialysis.</p>[0032] Lower values of Kd indicate a more specific binding of the antibody to the antigen than higher values.

All sequences are shown without the N-terminal Methionine, which is removed upon expression in vivo.</p>EXAMPLE 5</p>Binding of M2-specific scFv-msFc\u03b32c fusion proteins to M2-expressing L929 cells [0111] The ability of the recombinant antibodies to recognize native M2 was assessed by analyzing their reactivity with L929-M2#E9 cells, a clone of L929 cells expressing full-length M2 derived from mouse-adapted HlNl Influenza A PR8 (M2-PR; SEQ ID NO:84) (Table 7). Thus, L929-M2#E9 cells were brought to a single-cell suspension and incubated with 2-fold serial dilutions of, respectively, scFv-D005-msFc\u03b32c, scFv-E040-msFc\u03b32c or scFv-F052- msFc\u03b32c in FACS\u00ae buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 % FCS). After a 1 h incubation on ice, cells were washed in FACS\u00ae buffer and bound antibodies detected by a half hour incubation on ice with Cy5-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (Jackson Immuno, Cat No 115-176-071) in FACS buffer. After a final wash, the fluorescence intensity of the stained cells was analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScalibur\u00ae (Becton Dickinson). The antibodies scFv-D005-msFc\u03b32c, scFv-E040-msFc\u03b32c and scFv-F052-msFc\u03b32c were found to bind native, cell surface-expressed M2-PR with a high affinity, with an EC50 of 0.68, 0.73 and 0.46 nM, respectively.</p>EXAMPLE 6</p>Protective effect of M2-specific scFv-msFc\u03b32c fusion proteins in a mouse model of</p>Influenza A infection</p>[0112] The efficacy anti-M2 scFv-msFc\u03b32c antibodies in a prophylactic setting was tested in a mouse model of Influenza A infection. This model reflects most of the \n\n immunological and histological aspects of Influenza infection in humans and is therefore routinely used to assess the efficacy of anti- viral agents. Thus, six week old female C57BL/6 mice were injected intraperitoneally with 500 \u03bcg of scFv-D005-msFc\u03b32c, scFv-E040- msFc\u03b32c, scFv-F052-msFc\u03b32c or mouse IgG in PBS (6 mice per group). One day later, mice were bled in order to verify the presence of the antibodies in the blood by ELISA. Antibodies were readily detectable in the sera of all mice, except for one mouse receiving clone D005, which was subsequently removed from the analysis (not shown). Another day later (day 0), mice were infected intranasally with a lethal dose of mouse-adapted Influenza A virus PR8 (4 x LD50) followed by monitoring of weight-loss and fever (temperature drop) for 12 days. Control mice treated with mouse IgG developed severe signs of morbidity, characterized by dramatic temperature drop and weight loss, within 5 to 6 days and invariably died on days 7 or 8 (Figure 3C). In contrast, animals treated with M2-specific antibodies were almost completely protected from any signs of morbidity, developed hardly any signs of fev"
