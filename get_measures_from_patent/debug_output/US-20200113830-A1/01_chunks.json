    "nected to a separate piece of FEP tubing. All syringes were then driven at a flow rate of 7 mL/min using a syringe pump. The tube outlets were positioned to collect the mixtures in a 20 mL glass vial (while stirring), The stir bar was taken out and the ethanol/aqueous solution was allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for 1 hour. 4 ml of the mixture was loaded into a 5 cc syringe, which was connected to a piece of FEP tubing and in another 5 cc syringe connected to an equal length of FEP tubing, an equal amount of 100 mM citrate buffer (pH 6) was loaded. The two syringes were driven at 7 mL/min flow rate using the syringe pump and the final mixture collected in a 20 mL glass vial (while stirring). Next, the mixture collected from the second mixing step (liposomes) were passed through a Mustang Q membrane (an anion-exchange support that binds and removes anionic molecules, obtained from Pall Corporation), Before passing the liposomes, 4 mL of 1 M NaOH, 4 mL of 1 M NaCl and 10 mL of 100 mM citrate buffer (pH 6) were successively passed through the Mustang membrane. Liposomes were warmed for 10 min at 37\u00b0 C. before passing through the membrane. Next, liposomes were concentrated to 2 mL and dialyzed against 10-15 volumes of 1\u00d7PBS using TFF before recovering the final product. The TFF system and hollow fiber filtration membranes were purchased from Spectrum Labs and were used according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Polysulfone hollow fiber filtration membranes with a 100 kD pore size cutoff and 8 cm<sup>2 </sup>surface area were used. For in vitro and in vivo experiments, formulations were diluted to the required RNA concentration with 1\u00d7PBS.</p>(B) As method (A) except that, after rocking, 226.7 \u03bcL of the stock was added to 1.773 mL ethanol to make a working lipid stock solution of 2 ml thus modifying the lipid:RNA ratio.</p>(C) As method (B) except that the Mustang filtration was omitted, so liposomes went from the 20 mL glass vial into the IFF dialysis.</p>(D) As method (C) except that the TFF used polyethersulfone (PES) hollow fiber membranes (part number P-C1-100E-100-01N) with a 100 kD pore size cutoff and 20 cm<sup>2 </sup>surface area.</p>(E) As method (D) except that a Mustang membrane was used, as in method (A).</p>(F) As method (A) except that the Mustang filtration was omitted, so liposomes went from the 20 mL glass vial into the TFF dialysis.</p>(G) As method (D) except that a 4 mL working solution of RNA was prepared from a stock solution of \u02dc1 \u03bcg/\u03bcL in 100 mM citrate buffer (pH 6). Then four 20 mL glass vials were prepared in the same way. Two of them were used for the RNA working solution (2 mL in each vial) and the others for collecting the lipid and RNA mixes, as in (C). Rather than use T mixer, syringes containing RNA and the lipids were connected to a Mitos Droplet junction Chip (a glass .microfluidic device obtained from Syrris, Part no, 3000158) using PTFE tubing (0.03 inches internal diameter x  inch outer diameter) using a 4-way edge connector (Syrris). Two RNA streams and one lipid stream were driven by syringe pumps and the mixing of the ethanol and aqueous phase was done at the X junction (100 \u03bcm\u00d7105 \u03bcm) of the chip. The flow rate of all three streams was kept at 1.5 mL/min, hence the ratio of total aqueous to ethanolic flow rate was 2:1. The tube outlet was positioned to collect the mixtures in a 20 mL glass vial (while stirring). The stir bar was taken out and the ethanol/aqueous solution was allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for 1 h. Then the mixture was loaded in a 5 cc syringe, which was fitted to another piece of the P"
