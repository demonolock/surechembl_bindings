That is, outside of the cell (e.g., in circulation), the peptides disclosed herein are cyclic, and after entering the cell, the physiologically cleavable sequence is reduced to generate a linear sequence which then interacts with the CAL-PDZ binding domain.</p>Disclosed herein, in various embodiments, are peptides comprising (i) a cyclic cell-penetrating peptide sequence (cCPP) and (ii) a CAL-PDZ binding sequence conjugated, directly or indirectly, to one or more of an N-terminus of an amino acid in the cCPP, to a C-terminus of an amino acid on the cCPP, or on a side chain of an amino acid in the cCPP.

    "ditional benefit of improving the proteolytic stability against carboxypeptidases and endopeptidases due to its bulky tert-butyl side chain. Tle was thus selected as the PO residue in all further studies.</p>The same approach was applied to the more N-terminal positions. At the P-1 position, Arg was replaced with leucine (Leu), N<sup>\u03b5</sup>-nicotinoyllysine [Lys(NIC)], N<sup>\u03b5</sup>-trifluoroacetyllysine [Lys(TFA)], or homoarginine (homoArg). However, none of the substitutions further increased the CAL-binding affinity (Table 7, peptides 7-10) and therefore L-arginine was retained as the P-1 residue.</p>We next replaced the Gln at P-4 position with D-proline, D-cysteine, or L-cysteine (Table 7, peptides 11-13). A D-amino acid at the P-4 position would increase the proteolytic stability, whereas D/L-cysteine would provide an alternative site of cyclization. Cyclization at position P-4 (instead of P-3) would generate a smaller and more rigid ring, which would improve the metabolic stability and the cell-permeability of the peptide. At the P-5 site, replacement of Trp with 1- or 2-naphthylalanine did not significantly affect the binding (peptides 14 and 15).</p>We substituted L-penicillamine (Pen) for cysteine at the P-3 position, anticipating that the sterically hindered side chain of Pen would protect the peptide bonds N- and C-terminal to it from enzymatic degradation and stabilize the disulfide bond as well. Indeed, substitution of Pen also improved CAL binding by \u02dc2-fold (IC50=680 nM for peptide 16). At position P-6, substitution of 1- or 2-naphthylalanine for Phe resulted in \u02dc5-fold increase in CAL binding affinity, while D-2-naphthylalanine was less effective (peptides 17-19).</p>Next, we varied the stereochemical configuration of the N-terminal arginines, anticipating that D-arginine might improve the proteolytic stability and cell-permeability of the peptides. We found that a D-arginine at the P-9 position is tolerated.</p>We replaced the Gln at P-4 position of peptide 22 with a Pen and the Pen at the P-3 position with the isosteric Tle, to form a smaller ring (7 aa instead of 8 aa) and improve the proteolytic stability and cell-permeability (Table 7, peptide 24). Indeed, although these changes decreased CAL binding by \u02dc2-fold, cyclization by disulfide formation greatly increased the cell-permeability of peptide 24 (4-fold higher than peptide 22). Finally, we replaced the Trp at the P-5 position with 3-(3-benzothienyl)-L-alanine (Bta), which is isosteric with Trp but is less prone to oxidative degradation. This substitution gave peptide 25, which is 1.5-fold more potent than peptide 24 in CAL binding (IC50=235 nM) and has &gt;5-fold improvement in cell-permeability, most likely due to the greater hydrophobicity of the benzothienyl group relative to the indolyl ring of Trp. When labeled at the N-terminus with fluorescein and tested for binding to CAL PDZ domain by FA, a K<sub>D </sub>value of 49\u00b13 nM was obtained (Table 1, peptide 26).</p>Peptide 25 has similar in vitro potency for CAL binding to peptide 20, but has excellent cell-permeability (\u02dc20-fold better than peptide 20 or 5-fold better than CPP9) and proteolytic stability (e.g., orally active).</p>TABLE\u20037Sequences\u2003and\u2003CAL\u2003PDZ-Binding\u2003Affinities\u2003of\u2003Peptides\u2003of\u2003this\u2003DisclosureUptakeCompdSequenceIC<sub>50</sub>\u2003(nM)(%\u2003rel.)<sup>d</sup>\u20031Ac-Arg-Arg-Phe-Trp-Gln-Cys-Thr-Arg-Val-OH\u2003(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003\u20034520<sup>a</sup>NDNO:\u2003121,\u2003underlined\u2003portion\u2003only) \u20032Ac-Arg-Arg-Phe-Trp-Gln-Cys-Thr-Arg-Ile-OH\u2003(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003\u20033690<sup>a</sup>NDNO:\u2003122,\u2003underlined\u2003portion\u2003only) \u20033Ac-Arg-Arg-Phe-Trp-Gln-Cys-Thr-Arg-Cha-OH\u2003(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003\u20037880<sup>a</sup>NDNO:\u2003123,\u2003underlined\u2003portion\u2003only) \u20034Ac-Cys-Arg-Arg-Arg-Phe-Trp-Gln-Cys-Thr-Arg-MeLeu-&gt;20000<sup>b</sup>NDOHn\u2003(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u2003124,\u2003underlined\u2003portion\u2003only) \u20035Ac-Arg-Arg-Phe-Trp-Gln-Cys-Thr-Arg-Tle-OH\u2003(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003\u20031700<sup>a</sup>NDNO:\u2003125,\u2003underlined\u2003portion\u2003only) \u20036FITC-Cys-Arg-Arg-Arg-Phe-Trp-Gln-Cys-Thr-Arg-Tle-OH996\u2003\u00b1\u2003104ND(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u2003126,\u2003underlined\u2003portion\u2003only)(K<sub>D</sub>)<sup>c</sup> \u20037Ac-Arg-Arg-Phe-Trp-Gln-Cys-Thr-Leu-Tle-OH\u2003(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003\u20032020<sup>a</sup>NDNO:\u2003127,\u2003underlined\u2003portion\u2003only) \u20038Ac-Arg-Arg-Phe-Trp-G",

The potency and selectivity of inhibitor 29 was first assessed by comparing its binding affinity to the four PDZ domains of CAL, NHERF1, and NHERF2, which are involved in the trafficking of CFTR to and from the plasma membrane. Peptides were labeled with FITC at the N-terminus through a miniPEG linker and tested for binding to various PDZ domains by fluorescence polarization (FP). FITC-labeled peptide (50 nM) was incubated with varying concentrations of PDZ domain in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.01% Triton X-100 and 2 mM TCEP for 1 h at room temperature. After 1 h, 20 \u03bcL of each sample was pipetted into 384-well black-on-black microplates and fluorescence polarization was measured by using a TECAN Infinite M1000 plate reader. Data was processed using GraphPad PRISM ver. 8.0. Inhibitor 29 bound to the CAL PDZ domain with a K<sub>D </sub>of 6.0\u00b13.0 nM, while its K<sub>D </sub>values for NHERF1/2 PDZ domains ranged from 780 to 7480 nM, representing \u2265130-fold selectivity for the intended CAL PDZ domain (FIG. 5 and Table 9). In comparison, an earlier generation, peptide 20, showed a K<sub>D </sub>of 110 nM and only 14- to 36-fold selectivity for CAL vs NHERF PDZ domains. Thus, incorporation of Pip dramatically improved both potency and specificity of the inhibitor for CAL PDZ domain.</p>TABLE 9Binding affinity (KD) of peptides 20 and 29for CAL (CALP), NHERF1-PDZ1 (N1P1), NHERF2-PDZ1 (N2P1), and NHERF2-PDZ2 domains (N2P2).K<sub>D </sub>(nM)CompoundCALPN1P1N2P1N2P220110 \u00b1 10\u20021640 \u00b1 1502980 \u00b1 1504970 \u00b1 89029-FITC6.0 \u00b1 3.0780 \u00b1 101370 \u00b1 3807480 \u00b1 580</p>SAR by Alanine Scanning. To determine which residues are critical for CAL PDZ domain binding, each residue of peptide 29 was replaced with Ala or D-Ala and the binding affinity of the resulting peptides were determined by an FP-based competition assay (FIG. 6a).
