Experimental instrument and reagents:</p> a biomolecular interaction analyzer (Biacore 8K), </p>The apolipoprotein (a) is synthesized by Haoyang biotechnology limited in Hangzhou,</p>The NHS was purchased from Cytiva as a whole,</p>3. The experimental method comprises the following steps:</p> Apolipoprotein (a) is covalently linked to Series S Sensor Chip CM sensor chip in the Biacore 8K instrument. The activator was prepared by mixing 400mM EDC and 100mM NHS prior to injection. At a flow rate of 10. Mu.L/min, the CM5 sensor chip was activated by the activator for 420s. 60. Mu.g/mL of apolipoprotein (a) was dissolved in 10mM NaAc solution (pH 4.5) and injected into the Fc2 sample channel at a flow rate of 10. Mu.L/min to achieve an immobilization level of about 10000 RU. The inactivation was performed with 1M ethanolamine hydrochloride-sodium hydroxide at a flow rate of 10. Mu.L/min for 420s. The reference channel Fc1 is blocked by the same procedure as Fc2, but without the protein injection step. The compound was diluted to 100nM with running buffer (1 XPBS with 0.005% Tween-20, pH 7.4) and injected into channels Fc1-Fc2 at a flow rate of 30. Mu.L/min, bound for 90s, and dissociated for 210s. The binding and dissociation processes were all performed in running buffer. 3M magnesium chloride was injected into the running buffer at a flow rate of 20. Mu.L/min for 30s to regenerate the chip. The affinity constant KD reflects the magnitude of the interactive binding capacity and when the compound concentration is KD, the equilibrium signal Req is half of Rmax. The results show that the compound of the invention has stronger binding capacity with human Apo (a) protein. </p>ExamplesKD(nM)Example 113.4Example 232Example 323.7Example 429.7Example 527.6Example 616Example 76.18Example 818.6Example 915.2Example 1069.4Example 1420.2Example 1515.5Example 164.57</p>Test example 2: BLI detection of affinity of the Compounds of the invention with Apo (a)</p>1.

Experimental instrument and reagents:</p> A molecular interaction analyzer (ForteBio Octet red e), </p>SA sensor (ForteBio),</p>The 96-well plate was purchased from Greine,</p>3. The experimental method comprises the following steps:</p> Two 96-well plates were prepared, one as a sample plate and one as a pre-wet plate, in which 200 \u03bcl of one well was added with the solidification buffer, and the SA sensor was pre-wet for at least ten minutes. All reagents and samples were added to another black sample plate and after loading, the sensor disc and sample plate were placed in ForteBio Octet red e instrument. Program detection is set up in sequence. The experimental temperature was set at 30\u2103and the acquisition frequency was set at 5.0HZ. The biosensors were run in the first column of 1 XPBS, pH7.4,0.02% Tween-20,0.1% BSA for 60s, this step being the baseline step. The biotin-labeled apolipoprotein (a) was diluted to 40. Mu.g/ml with 1 XPBS, pH7.4,0.02% Tween-20,0.1% BSA, added to the second column, and run on the column for a period of time until the amount of immobilization on the sensor was 2.0nm. The biosensor was run in the third column of 1 XPBS, pH7.4,0.02% Tween-20,0.1% BSA for 60s, this step being the baseline step. Compounds were diluted to 100nM with 1 XPBS, pH7.4,0.02% Tween-20,0.1% BSA and added to the fourth column and the sensor run in this column for 60s. The sensor was run in the third column of 1 XPBS, pH7.4,0.02% Tween-20,0.1% BSA for 120s during which the compound was dissociated from the sensor. The affinity constant KD reflects the magnitude of the interactive binding capacity and when the analyte concentration is KD, the equilibrium signal Req is half of Rmax.
