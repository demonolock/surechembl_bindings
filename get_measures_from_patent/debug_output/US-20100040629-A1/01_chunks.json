    "gonist antibody of the invention increases at least one activity of c-Met by 10-fold.</p>Fragments or analogs of antibodies or immunoglobulin molecules can be readily prepared by those of ordinary skill in the art following the teachings of this specification. Preferred amino- and carboxy-termini of fragments or analogs occur near boundaries of functional domains. Structural and functional domains can be identified by comparison of the nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence data to public or proprietary sequence databases. Preferably, computerized comparison methods are used to identify sequence motifs or predicted protein conformation domains that occur in other proteins of known structure and/or function. Methods to identify protein sequences that fold into a known three-dimensional structure are known. See Bowie et al., Science 253:164 (1991).</p>The term \u201csurface plasmon resonance\u201d, as used herein, refers to an optical phenomenon that allows for the analysis of real-time biospecific interactions by detection of alterations in protein concentrations within a biosensor matrix, for example using the BIACORE\u2122 system (Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden and Piscataway, N.J.). For further descriptions, see Jonsson U. et al., Ann. Biol. Clin. 51:19-26 (1993); Jonsson U. et al., Biotechniques 11:620-627 (1991); Jonsson B. et al., J. Mol. Recognit. 8:125-131 (1995); and Johnsson B. et al., Anal. Biochem. 198:268-277 (1991).</p>The term \u201cK<sub>D</sub>\u201d refers to the equilibrium dissociation constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction.</p>The term \u201cepitope\u201d includes any protein determinant capable of specific binding to an immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor or otherwise interacting with a molecule. Epitopic determinants generally consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or carbohydrate or sugar side chains and generally have specific three dimensional structural characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. An epitope may be \u201clinear\u201d or \u201cconformational.\u201d In a linear epitope, all of the points of interaction between the protein and the interacting molecule (such as an antibody) occur linearally along the primary amino acid sequence of the protein. In a conformational epitope, the points of interaction occur across amino acid residues on the protein that are separated from one another. An antibody is said to specifically bind an antigen when the dissociation constant is \u22661 mM, preferably \u2266100 nM and most preferably \u226610 nM. In certain embodiments, the K<sub>D </sub>is 1 \u03bcM to 500 \u03bcM. In other embodiments, the K<sub>D </sub>is between 500 \u03bcM to 1 \u03bcM. In other embodiments, the K<sub>D </sub>is between 1 \u03bcM to 100 nM. In other embodiments, the K<sub>D </sub>is between 100 mM to 10 nM. Once a desired epitope on an antigen is determined, it is possible to generate antibodies to that epitope, e.g., using the techniques described in the present invention. Alternatively, during the discovery process, the generation and characterization of antibodies may elucidate information about desirable epitopes. From this information, it is then possible to competitively screen antibodies for binding to the same epitope. An approach to achieve this is to conduct cross-competition studies to find antibodies that competitively bind with one another, e.g., the antibodies compete for binding to the antigen. A high throughput process for \u201cbinning\u201d antibodies based upon their cross-competition is described in International Patent Application No. WO 03/48731.</p>As used herein, the twenty conventional amino acids and their abbreviations follow conventional usage. See Immunology\u2014A Synthesis (2nd Edition, E. S. Golub and D. R. Gren, Eds., Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, Mass. (1991)), incorporated herein by reference.</p>The term \u201cpolynucleotide\u201d as referred to herein means a polymeric form of nucleotides of at least 10 bases in length, either ri",
    " 4, 8, 12, or 16, or (d) an antibody that comprises both a heavy chain variable domain as defined in (b) and a light chain variable domain as defined in (c).</p>One can determine whether an antibody binds to the same epitope or cross competes for binding with an anti-c-Met antibody by using methods known in the art. In one embodiment, one allows the anti-c-Met antibody of the invention to bind to c-Met under saturating conditions and then measures the ability of the test antibody to bind to c-Met. If the test antibody is able to bind to c-Met at the same time as the anti-c-Met antibody, then the test antibody binds to a different epitope as the anti-c-Met antibody. However, if the test antibody is not able to bind to c-Met at the same time, then the test antibody binds to the same epitope, an overlapping epitope, or an epitope that is in close proximity to the epitope bound by the human anti-c-Met antibody. This experiment can be performed using ELISA, RIA, BIACORE\u2122, or flow cytometry. In a preferred embodiment, the experiment is performed using ELISA. Methods of determining K<sub>D </sub>are discussed further below.</p>Inhibition of c-Met Activity by Anti-c-Met Antibody</p>In another embodiment, the invention provides an anti-c-Met antibody that inhibits the binding of HGF to the c-Met receptor. In a preferred embodiment, the c-Met receptor is human. In another preferred embodiment, the anti-c-Met antibody is a human antibody. The IC<sub>50 </sub>can be measured in a ligand binding assay by ELISA, RIA, or other assays and cell-based assays such as scattering assay, soft agar growth and tubulomorphogenesis assay. In one embodiment, the antibody or portion thereof inhibits ligand binding between HGF and c-Met with an IC<sub>50 </sub>of no more than 5 \u03bcg/ml, preferably no more than 1 \u03bcg/ml, more preferably than 0.5 \u03bcg/ml, even more preferably no more than 0.20 \u03bcg/ml as measured by an ELISA assay. (See FIG. 1A) Example III exemplifies this type of assay.</p>In another embodiment, the invention provides an anti-c-Met antibody that prevents activation of c-Met in the presence of HGF. In a preferred embodiment, the anti-c-Met antibody inhibits HGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation that occurs upon binding to c-Met. One can determine whether an anti-c-Met antibody can prevent activation of c-Met in the presence of HGF by determining the levels of autophosphorylation for c-Met by Western blotting or an ELISA assay. In a preferred embodiment, one would determine the levels of autophosphorylation of c-Met using an ELISA assay. In another preferred embodiment, the IC<sub>50</sub>, measured using an ELISA assay, is no more than 5 \u03bcg/ml, preferably no more than 1 \u03bcg/ml, more preferably than 0.5 \u03bcg/ml, even more preferably no more than 0.20 \u03bcg/ml. Example IV exemplifies one type of assay that measures inhibition of c-Met activation by an anti-c-Met antibody in the presence of HGF (See FIG. 1B).</p>In another aspect of the invention, the antibody may cause a dow",
