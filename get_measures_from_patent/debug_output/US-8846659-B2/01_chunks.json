J. Biological Chem. 2007, 282, 31186-31196; Dicker et al. J. Biol. Chem. 2008, 283, 23599-23609 and Dicker et al. Biochemistry 2008, 47, 13481-13488. BMS-641493 is a known active-site binding inhibitor as it can be competed off the Kd values for [3H]BMS-641493 were determined from fitting data to a saturation binding curve using Graphpad Prism, V4.01. The Ki measurement toward integrase was made by measuring the inhibition of binding of [3H]BMS-641493 to enzyme-SPA bead complexes in the presence of serial dilutions of the test compounds. The Ki value was determined from the [3H]BMS-641493 Kd and the inhibition binding curve using Graphpad Prism, V4.03. Results are shown in the Table 1.</p>TABLE 1ExampleActivity \u03bcM20.02130.12240.02153.88060.40070.22280.11591.074100.009110.019120.013130.013140.041150.057161.469170.010180.016</p>Inhibition of HIV Replication.</p>A recombinant NL-Rluc virus was constructed in which a section of the nef gene from NL4-3 was replaced with the Renilla Luciferase gene. The NL-RLuc virus was prepared by co-transfection of two plasmids, pNLRLuc and pVSVenv. The pNLRLuc contains the NL-Rluc DNA cloned into pUC18 at the PvuII site, while the pVSVenv contains the gene for VSV G protein linked to an LTR promoter. Transfections were performed at a 1:3 ratio of pNLRLuc to pVSVenv on 293T cells using the LipofectAMINE PLUS kit from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, Calif.) according to manufactures instruction, and the pseudotype virus generated was titered in MT-2 cells.</p>Susceptibility of viruses to compounds was determined by incubation in the presence of serial dilutions of the compound. The 50% effective concentration (EC<sub>H</sub>) was calculated by using the exponential form of the median effect equation where (Fa)=1/[1+(ED<sub>50</sub>/drug conc.)<sup>m</sup>] (Johnson V A, Byington R T. Infectivity Assay. In Techniques in HIV Research. ed. Aldovini A, Walker B D. 71-76. New York: Stockton Press. 1990). the results from at least 2 experiments were used to calculate the EC<sub>50 </sub>values. Results are shown in the Table 2.</p>TABLE 2ExampleA"
