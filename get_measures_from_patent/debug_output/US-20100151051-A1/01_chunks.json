    "ility to invade neighbouring tissues, ability to build metastases at distant sites, ability to promote blood vessel growth (angiogenesis).</p>Tumor angiogenesis is the proliferation of a network of blood vessels that penetrates into the tumor, supplying nutrients and oxygen and removing waste products. Tumor angiogenesis actually starts with cancerous tumor cells releasing molecules that send signals to surrounding normal host tissue. This signalling activates certain genes in the host tissue that, in turn, make proteins to encourage growth of new blood vessels. Solid tumors must stimulate the formation of new blood vessels in order to obtain the nutrients and oxygen necessary for their growth, thus providing a route by which the tumors can metastasize to distant sites.</p>Experimental evidence has suggested that malignant tumors can induce angiogenesis through the elaboration of a variety of factors, such as acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha), tumor necrosis growth factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and many others (Liotta et al., 1991, Cell 64: 327-336; Hanahan et al., Cell 86: 353-364).</p>Nowadays, plenty of chemotherapeutic molecules targeting angiogenesis are available on the market. Well known naturally occurring angiogenesis inhibitors are angiostatin, endostatin, interferons, platelet factor 4, prolactin 16 Kd fragment, thrombospondin, TIMP-1 (tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease-1), TIMP-2 and TIMP-3. These molecules can be used as chemotherapeutic treatments, as well as other drugs such as for example combrestatin A4, EMD 121974, TNP-470, squalamine, thalidomide, interferon-alpha, anti-VEGF, antibodies . . . . However, their efficiency is never sufficient and alternative treatments are desirable.</p>There is therefore a need of alternative chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of tumors, having increased efficiency, being less invasive or toxic, and resulting in an increased rate of recovery.</p>WO 03/080105, in the name of the Applicant, describes five genes involved in the regulation of angiogenesis. Amongst these genes, \u201cgene 168\u201d (SEQ ID N<sup>o </sup>1 in this specification), which encodes \u201cprotein 168A\u201d (SEQ ID N<sup>o </sup>2 in this specification), has been described as implied in the activation of angiogenesis. In particular, WO 03/080105 discloses that protein 168A is expressed in endothelial cells stimulated with pro-angiogenic factors, such as for example TNF-\u03b1. WO 03/080105 also describes that the expression, in human endothelial cells, of an antisens sequence of gene 168, i.e. the inhibition of the expression of gene 168, inhibits the formation of capillary tubes.</p>In silico experiments further revealed that protein 168A, which is constituted of 924 aminoacids, may have a single transmembrane domain, and five Immunoglobulin-like domains.</p>Going deeper in t",

The nucleic acid sequence coding for 168A-T2 within the pET-30 vector is given in SEQ ID NO:5.</p>The purified vector was then introduced in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLys for protein production.

The insoluble fraction obtained was treated with Tris-HCl 20 mM, urea 8 M, imidazol 5 mM, NaCl 0.5 M, GSH 5 mM, pH 8.0. After this treatment, the suspension was centrifuged and the supernatant collected, filtered on 0.45 \u03bcm membranes to discard insoluble materials. The filtered extract was then used to purify the protein 168A-T2 by using a His-Trap column (Amersham\u00ae) connected to a HPLC system (Amersham).</p>The purified protein obtained was diluted in 4 M urea and 0.3 M imidazol.
