    "or molecule).</p>In various embodiments, an antigen binding molecule is an antibody or fragment thereof, including one or more of the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) disclosed herein and shown in FIGS. 5-21, which specifically bind the anti-CD19 scFv FMC63, as well as molecules comprising the anti-CD19 scFv FMC63, and cells presenting such molecules. In further embodiments, the antigen binding molecule binds to a CAR comprising the anti-CD19 scFv FMC63, as well as molecules comprising the anti-CD19 scFv FMC63, and can be expressed on an immune cell, such as a T cell.</p>The term \u201cautologous\u201d refers to any material derived from the same individual to which it is later to be re-introduced. For example, the engineered autologous cell therapy (eACT\u2122) methods described herein involve collection of lymphocytes from a patient, which are then engineered to express a construct, e.g., a CAR construct, and then administered back to the same patient.</p>As used herein, the term \u201cbinding affinity\u201d means the strength of the sum total of non-covalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., an antigen binding molecule such as an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g., an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, \u201cbinding affinity\u201d refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1:1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., antibody and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>). Affinity can be measured and/or expressed in a number of ways known in the art, including, but not limited to, equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>), and equilibrium association constant (K<sub>A</sub>). The K<sub>D </sub>is calculated from the quotient of k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>, whereas K<sub>A </sub>is calculated from the quotient of k<sub>on</sub>/k<sub>off</sub>. k<sub>on </sub>refers to the association rate constant of, e.g., an antibody to an antigen, and k<sub>off </sub>refers to the dissociation of, e.g., an antibody to an antigen. The k<sub>on </sub>and k<sub>off </sub>can be determined by standard techniques known to one of ordinary skill in the art, such as BIAcore\u00ae or KinExA or surface plasmon resonance.</p>As used herein, the term \u201ccomplementarity determining region\u201d or \u201cCDR\u201d means an amino acid sequence that contributes to antigen binding specificity and affinity. Framework regions can aid in maintaining the proper confirmation of the CDRs to promote binding between the antigen binding molecule and an antigen. A number of definitions of the CDRs are commonly in use: Kabat numbering, Chothia numbering, AbM numbering, or contact numbering. The AbM definition is a compromise between the Kabat and Chothia systems, and is used by Oxford Molecular's AbM antibody modelling software. Table A defines CDRs using each numbering system. The contact definition is based on an analysis of the available complex crystal structures.</p>TABLE ALoopKabatAbMChothiaContactL1L24--L34L24--L34L24--L34L30--L36L2L50--L56L50--L56L50--L56L46--L55L3L89--L97L89--L97L89--L97L89--L96H1H31--H35BH",
    "nt having the VL, VH, CL and CH domains; a \u201cF(ab\u2032)<sub>2 </sub>fragment\u201d is a bivalent fragment having two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; a \u201cFv fragment\u201d has the VH and VL domains of a single arm of an antibody; and a \u201cdAb fragment\u201d has a VH domain, a VL domain, or an antigen-binding fragment of a VH or VL domain.</p>As used herein, the terms \u201cimmunospecifically binds,\u201d \u201cimmunospecifically recognizes,\u201d \u201cspecifically binds,\u201d and \u201cspecifically recognizes\u201d are analogous terms and are used interchangeably in the context of antigen binding molecules, and means that a given molecule preferentially binds to an antigen (e.g., epitope or immune complex) as such binding is understood by one skilled in the art. For example, an antigen binding molecule that specifically binds to an antigen may bind to other peptides or polypeptides, but with a comparatively lower affinity as determined by, e.g., immunoassays, BIAcore\u00ae, KinExA 3000 instrument (Sapidyne Instruments, Boise, Id.), or other assays known in the art. In some embodiments, molecules that specifically bind to an antigen bind to the antigen with a K<sub>A </sub>that is at least 2 logs, 2.5 logs, 3 logs, 4 logs or greater than the K<sub>A </sub>when the molecules bind to another antigen.</p>In another embodiment, molecules that specifically bind to an antigen (e.g., the anti-CD19 scFv FMC63; SEQ ID NO: 1), as well as molecules comprising this sequence and cells presenting such molecules) bind with a dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) of about 1\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M. In some embodiments, the antigen binding molecule specifically binds an antigen (e.g., the anti-CD19 scFv FMC63, as well as molecules comprising this sequence and cells presenting such molecules) with \u201chigh affinity\u201d when the K<sub>d </sub>is about 1\u00d710<sup>\u22129 </sup>M to about 5\u00d710<sup>\u22129 </sup>M. In some embodiments, the antigen binding molecule specifically binds an antigen (e.g., the anti-CD19 scFv FMC63, as well as molecules comprising this sequence and cells presenting such molecules) with \u201cvery high affinity\u201d when the K<sub>d </sub>is 1\u00d710<sup>10 </sup>M to about 5\u00d710<sup>\u221210 </sup>M.</p>In still another embodiment, molecules that specifically bind to an antigen (e.g., the anti-CD19 scFv FMC63, as well as molecules comprising this sequence and cells presenting such molecules) do not cross react with other proteins under similar binding conditions. In some embodiments, molecules that specifically bind to an antigen (e.g., the anti-CD19 scFv FMC63, as well as molecules comprising this sequence and cells presenting such molecules) do not cross react with other proteins that do not comprise the anti-CD19 scFv FMC63, molecules comprising this sequence and cells presenting such molecules. In some embodiments, provided herein is an antibody or fragment thereof that binds to the anti-CD19 scFv FMC63, as well as molecules comprising this sequence and cells presenting such molecules, with higher affinity than to ",
    "g., an antigen binding molecule that recognizes the anti-CD19 scFv FMC63 (SEQ ID NO: 1), such as those disclosed herein: Clone 7, 13, 14-1, 14-7, 15 and/or 17, and fragments thereof). This method may be adapted for any antibody recognizing a protein of interest on a T-cell containing an activation domain, such as a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) comprising SEQ ID NO: 1. Activation can be achieved using plate-bound, bead-bound, polymer-bound, or other form of the antibody that specifically recognizes an extracellular component of the CAR or similar molecule.</p>In some embodiments, the method can be performed as follows: first, a 12-well tissue culture treated plate is coated with 1 mL of a 1.5 \u03bcg/mL solution of an anti-CD19 scFv FMC63 antigen binding molecule disclosed herein, which has been diluted in HBSS or other phosphate buffer, and placed in an incubator at 37 C for 2 hours. Next, the plate is washed three times with HBSS or other phosphate buffer having a suitable pH, ionic strength, etc. Continuing, CAR-positive T-cells in OpTmizer media (with supplements) or RPMI-1640 media with 10% FBS are added to the tissue culture treated plate. The cells are then grown at 37 C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>After 2 days, the cells are examined to determine any increase in the percent CAR-positive cells. This determination can be made by identifying any increase in the expression of any cell-surface and/or internal markers, including, but not limited to 4-1BB, CD69, CD25, PD-1, and Ki-67.</p>Example 5Generation of Humanized Sequences from Rabbit AntibodiesThe Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) software developed by Chemical Computing Group (CCG) can be used to generate alignments between the rabbit antibody Clones 7, 13, 14-1, 14-7, 15 and 17 and pairs of variable light and heavy chains, VL and VH, respectively from two databases:\n(1) The Abysis human database: a database of about 2000 known human VL/VH sequence pairs from IMGT-LigM DB; and(2) A human germline database: a database of germline sequences.\n</p>Humanized models show the best sequence alignments (highest identity to both the VL and VH domains) with fewest gaps. The top 100 antibody pairs from each human database can be exported and clustered using kClust (Hauser, Mayer, &amp; Soding, (2013) BMC Bioinformatics, 248). Tables for VL and VH sequences for each of the antibodies, can be constructed, with sequences from each of the two databases clustered at 90% and 95%.</p>Example 6Flow Cytometry of Humanized FMC63 CARHumanized FMC63 CAR constructs were identified comprising conserved CDR loops (e.g., comprising amino acid sequences defined in Table C and D) and bind to CD19. Jurkat cells expressing FMC63 and humanized FMC63 CAR constructs were generated by transduction with lentivirus carrying the respective constructs. Monoclonal antibodies 14-1, 15, and 17-4 were incubated with CAR-expressing Jurkat cells and detected with a FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit F(ab\u2032)2 antibody (Thermo). An anti"
