Sodium benzoate, flavor, and color are diluted with water and added with stirring. Sufficient water is then added. \n\nFormulation 4 - Tablets</p>An aryl dicarboxamide of formula (I), is admixed as a dry powder with a dry gelatin binder in an approximate 1 :2 weight ratio. A minor amount of magnesium stearate is added as a lubricant. The mixture is formed into 300-600 mg tablets (150-300 mg of active aryl dicarboxamide derivative) in a tablet press.</p>Formulation 5 - Injection</p>An aryl dicarboxamide of formula (I), is dissolved in a buffered sterile saline injectable aqueous medium to a concentration of approximately 5 mg/ml. \n\n</p>Example 55 : Biological assays</p>The compounds of formula (I), may be subjected to the following assays :</p>(1) The PTP Enzyme Assay</p>(2) The in vivo assay in db/db mice</p>(1) The PTP Enzyme Assay fin vitro assay<sup>\"</sup>)</p>Assays for the determination of the PTP inhibitory activity of test compounds are well known to a person skilled in the art. An example of such an assay is described below :</p>The PTP Enzyme Assay aims at determining the extent of inhibition of PTPs, e.g. of PTPIB, SHP-1, SHP-2, or GLEPP-1 in the presence of a test compound of formula (I). The inhibition is illustrated by IC50 values which denote the concentration of test compound necessary to achieve an inhibition of 50% of saidPTP's using the following concentration of the PTP substrate DiFMUP :</p>- 5 \u03bcM DiFMUP for PTPIB;</p>- 20 \u03bcM DiFMUP for SHP-1 and SHP-2; - 30 \u03bcM DiFMUP for GLEPP-1.</p>a) PTPs cloning</p>The cloning and expression of the catalytic domain e.g. of PTPIB, may be performed as described in J. Biol. Chem. 2000, 275(13), pp 9792-9796.</p>b) Materials and Methods</p>The DiFMUP assay allows to follow the dephosphorylation of DiFMUP (6,8-DiFluoro-4- MethylUmbelliferyl Phosphate) - which is the PTP substrate - mediated by PTP into its stable hydrolysis product, i.e. DiFMU (6,8-difluoro-7-hydroxy coumarin). Due to its rather \n\nlow pKa and its high quantum yield, DiFMU allows to measure both acidic and alkaline phosphatase activities with a great sensitivity.</p>Assays were performed in a 96 well plate format, using the catalytic core of a human recombinant PTP as the enzyme and 6,8-DiFluoro-4-MethylUmbelliferyl Phosphate (DiFMUP, Molecular Probes, D-6567) as a substrate. Compounds to be tested were dissolved in 100% DMSO at a concentration of 2 mM. Subsequent dilutions of the test compounds (to yield a concentration of 100, 30, 10, 3, 1,0.3, 0J, 0.03, 0.01, 0.001 \u03bcM) were performed in 60 % DMSO manually. 8 \u03bcl of diluted compound or vehicle (60% DMSO = control) was distributed to a black Costar 96 well plate. 42\u03bcl of human recombinant PTP enzyme diluted in assay buffer (20mM Tris HCI pH 7.5, 0.01 % IGEPAL CA-630, OJmM ethylenediaminetetracetic acid, lmM DL-Dithiothreitol) can be added to the dilutions of compound or vehicule (distributed to a black Costar 96 well plate), followed by 50\u03bcl of DiFMUP diluted in the assay buffer. The reaction ran for 30 minutes at room temperature before reading the fluorescence intensity (integral or intensity) on a Perkin-Elmer Victor 2 spectrofluorimeter (excitation of 6,8-difluoro-7-hydroxy coumarin is at 355nm, the emission at 460 nm, for OJs). The percentage of inhibition is determined by measuring the relative fluorescence ion absence of a test compound (PTP inhibitor), i.e. with the solvent alone (5% DMSO). The IC50 values for inhibition were determined in triplicates.</p>The tested compounds according to formula (I) display an inhibition (illustrated by IC50 values) with regard to PTP of preferably less than 20 \u03bcM, more preferred less than 5 \u03bcM.</p>For instance, the compound of example 1 displays an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 1.0 \u03bcM in respect of PTPIB, an IC50 value of 1.2 \u03bcM in respect of GLEPP-1, an IC50 value of 4.0 and 1.9 \u03bcM in respect of SHP-1 and SHP-2. \n\n(2) In vivo assay in db/db mice</p>The compounds may be subjected to the following assay which aims at determining the anti-diabetic effect of the test compounds of formula (I) in a model of postprandial glycemia in db/db mice, in vivo.</p>The assay is performed as follows :</p>A total of 24 db/db mice (about 8-9 weeks; obtained from IFFACREDO, l'Arbreste, France) are fasted during 20 hours.</p>4 groups, each consisting of 6 animals are formed :</p>\u2022 Group 1 : The animals are administered (per os) a dose of 10 mg/kg of vehicle.</p>\u2022 Group 2 : The animals are administered (per os) a dose of 20 mg kg of the test compound according to formula (I).</p>\u2022 Group 3 : The animals are administered (per os) a dose of 100 mg/kg of the test compoimd according to formula (I).</p>\u2022 Group 4 : The animals are administered (per os) a dose of 200 mg/kg of the test compound according to formula (I).</p>After oral administration of the compounds of formula (I) solubilized or sus-pended in CarboxyMethylCellulose (0.5%), Tween 20 (0.25%) and water as vehicle, the animals have access to commercial food (D04, UAR, Nillemoisson/Orge, France) ad libitum. The diabetic state of the mice is verified by determining the blood glucose level before drug administration. Blood glucose and serum insulin levels are then determined 4 hrs after drug administration. \n\nThe determination of the blood glucose level is performed using a glucometer (Precision "
