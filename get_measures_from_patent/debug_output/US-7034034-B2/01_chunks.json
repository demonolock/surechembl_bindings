    "he term \u201csubstitution\u201d refers to replacing a hydrogen atom in a molecular structure with a substituent as described above, such that the valence on the designated atom is not exceeded, and such that a chemically stable compound (i.e., a compound that can be isolated, characterized, and tested for biological activity) results from the substitution.</p>The term \u201cNPY receptor\u201d refers to a protein comprising any NPY receptor polypeptide sequence, with mammalian and especially human and monkey sequences generally preferred. \u201cNPY5 receptor\u201d refers to a protein comprising a NPY receptor subtype Y<sub>5 </sub>sequence, such as those described within U.S. Pat. No. 5,602,024 and herein. An NPY or NPY5 receptor may consist entirely of a naturally-occurring sequence, or may comprise additional components (e.g., N-terminal leader sequence) that do not substantially inhibit the receptor's ability to bind ligand (i.e., at least 50% of the binding affinity of the receptor for NPY and/or PYY is retained). For example, a chimeric NPY5/NPY1 receptor, as described herein, is considered to be an NPY5 receptor. Similarly, truncated NPY receptor sequences, or sequences containing amino acid deletions, substitutes, additions or modifications may be used, provided that NPY receptor binding properties are not substantially diminished (i.e., at least 50% of the endogenous ligand-binding affinity is retained). The binding affinity of a candidate NPY receptor for ligand may be evaluated using a standard binding assay as provided herein (see also J. Clin. Invest. (1998) 102:2136).</p>A \u201cNPY5 receptor modulator,\u201d also referred to herein as a \u201cmodulator,\u201d is a compound that modulates (i.e., increases or decreases) ligand binding to NPY5 receptor. In other words, a modulator may be an NPY5 receptor antagonist or agonist. Modulators comprise a compound that is a 2-cyclohexyl-4-phenyl-1H-imidazole derivative having NPY5 receptor modulating activity. A modulator may consist entirely of such a compound, or may further comprise one or more additional moieties, provided that the modulating activity of the active compound is not substantially diminished (i.e., the ability to increase or decrease ligand binding to NPY5 receptor, as determined using a binding assay provided herein, is not diminished by more than 50%). Such additional moieties include, for example, targeting moieties, other active agents and carriers, any of which may be linked to the active compound via a variety of standard techniques including direct condensation, or by way of bi- or multi-functional linkers.</p>Alternatively, such additional moieties may be combined with the active compound, without covalent linking. A modulator binds \u201cspecifically\u201d to NPY5 receptor if it binds human NPY5 receptor (total binding minus nonspecific binding) with a Ki that is 10-fold, preferably 100-fold, and more preferably 1000-fold, less than the Ki measured for modulator binding to other NPY receptors, such as NPY1. A modulator binds with \u201chigh affinity\u201d if the K<sub>i </sub>at an NPY receptor is less than 1 micromolar, preferably less than 100 nanomolar or 10 nanomolar. Binding assays for evaluating Ki may be performed, for example, using the human in vitro NPY5 binding assay provided herein. Ligand binding to NPY1 receptor may be inhibited within such assays using well known techniques, such as through the use of Thomae compound, as described herein. It will be apparent that either NPY or PYY may be used as the ligand within binding assays.</p>A \u201ctargeting moiety,\u201d as used herein is a substance (e.g., a compound or a cell) that increases the local concentration of a modulator in the vicinity of a target site in a patient. There are a wide variety of targeting moieties known in the art, including antibodies and fragments thereof, receptors, ligands and other molecules that bind to cells of, or close to, a target tissue.</p>A \u201ccarrier,\u201d \u201ccarrier group\u201d or \u201ccarrier molecule\u201d is a substance that may be associated with an active compound prior to administration to a patient, generally for the purpose of controlling stability or bioavailability of the compound. Carriers for use within such formulations are generally biocompatible, and may also be biodegradable. Carriers include, for example, monovalent or multivalent molecules such as serum albumin (e.g., human or bovine), egg albumin, peptides, polylysine and polysaccharides such as aminodextran and polyamidoamines. Carriers also include solid support materials such as beads and microparticles comprising, for example, polylactate polyglycolate, poly(lactide-co-glycolide), polyacrylate, latex, starch, cellulose or dextran. A carrier may bear the compounds in a variety of ways, including c",

Further, as noted above, all compounds of the present invention may be present as a free base or as a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt.</p>Substituted derivatives of 2-cyclohexyl-4-phenyl-1H-imidazole provided herein detectably alter (modulate) NPY binding to NPY5 receptor, as determined using standard in vitro NPY5 receptor ligand binding assays and/or signal transduction assays. References herein to an \u201cNPY5 receptor ligand binding assay\u201d are intended to refer to the protocol provided in Example 11. Briefly, a competition assay may be performed in which an NPY5 receptor preparation is incubated with labeled (e.g., <sup>125</sup>I) NPY and unlabeled test compound. Within the assays provided herein, the NPY5 receptor used is preferably a mammalian NPY5 receptor, more preferably a human or monkey NPY5 receptor. The receptor may be recombinantly expressed or naturally expressed, and may comprise a native sequence or a modified sequence (e.g., truncated and/or fused to a non-native N-terminal sequence). The NPY5 receptor preparation may be, for example, a membrane preparation from Sf9 cells or Bowes Melanoma cells that recombinantly express human NPY5 receptor or a human chimeric NPY5/NPY1 receptor.</p>Incubation with a compound that detectably modulates NPY binding to NPY5 receptor will result in a decrease or increase in the amount of label bound to the NPY5 receptor preparation, relative to the amount of label bound in the absence of the compound. Preferably, such a compound will exhibit a K<sub>i </sub>at an NPY5 receptor of less than 1 micromolar, more preferably less than 500 nM, 100 nM, 20 nM or 10 nM, within an assay performed as described in Example 11. Generally preferred compounds are NPY5 receptor antagonists, and decrease NPY5 receptor activity (as measured by calcium mobilization, as described in Example 12) by at least 20%, preferably by at least 50%, and most preferably by at least 80",
    " known cell culture and cell separation methods. For example, modulators may be linked to the interior surface of a tissue culture plate or other cell culture support, for use in immobilizing NPY5-expressing cells for screens, assays and growth in culture. Such linkage may be performed by any suitable technique, such as the methods described above, as well as other standard techniques. Modulators may also be used to facilitate cell identification and sorting in vitro, permitting the selection of cells expressing NPY5. Preferably, the modulator(s) for use in such methods are labeled as described herein. Within one preferred embodiment, a modulator linked to a fluorescent marker, such as fluorescein, is contacted with the cells, which are then analyzed by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS).</p>Within other aspects, methods are provided for modulating binding of an NPY5 receptor ligand (such as NPY or PYY) to NPY5 receptor in vitro or in vivo, comprising contacting a sufficient amount of NPY5 receptor with a modulator provided herein, under conditions suitable for binding of NPY5 to the receptor. Preferably, within such methods, NPY and/or PYY binding to receptor is inhibited by the modulator. The NPY5 receptor may be present in solution, in a cultured or isolated cell preparation or within a patient. In general, the amount of compound contacted with the receptor in vivo should be sufficient to modulate NPY binding to NPY5 receptor in vitro within, for example, a ligand binding assay as described in Example 11. NPY<sub>5 </sub>receptors used to determine in vitro binding may be obtained from a variety of sources, for example from preparations of rat brain or from cells expressing cloned human NPY<sub>5 </sub>receptors.</p>Also provided herein are methods for modulating the signal-transducing activity of NPY5 receptor, by contacting an NPY5 receptor, either in vivo or in vitro, with a sufficient amount of an NPY5 receptor modulator as described above, under conditions suitable for binding of NPY to NPY5 receptor. The NPY5 receptor may be present in solution, in a cultured or isolated cell preparation or within a patient. In general, the amount of a modulator that is sufficient to alter the signal-transducing activity of NPY5 receptor may be determined via a NPY5 receptor signal transduction assay, such as the assay described in Example 12.</p>The following Examples are offered by way of illustration and not by way of limitation.

By this measure, a 1-liter culture of cells typically yields 50\u201375 mg of total membrane protein.</p>Purified P2 membranes were thawed, centrifuged and washed by PBS and re-suspended by Dounce homogenization (tight pestle) in binding buffer (50 mM Tris(HCl), 5 mM KCl, 120 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), pH 7.4). For competition analysis, membranes (5\u201350 \u03bcg) were added to polypropylene tubes containing 0.050 nM [<sup>125</sup>I]PYY(porcine) and 2 \u03bcl test compound in DMSO (1 \u03bcM\u20134 \u03bcM final concentration). For saturation binding analysis, membranes (5\u201350 \u03bcg) were added to polypropylene tubes containing 0.010\u20130.500 nM [<sup>125</sup>I]PYY (porcine; New England Nuclear Corp., Boston, Mass.). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 \u03bcM NPY (human; American Peptide Co., Sunnyvale, Calif.) and accounted for less than 10% of total binding. Following a 2 hour incubation at room temperature, the reaction was terminated by rapid vacuum filtration. Samples were filtered over presoaked (in 1.0% polyethyleneimine for 2 hours prior to use) GF/C WHATMAN filters and rinsed 2 times with 5 mL cold binding buffer without BSA. Remaining bound radioactivity was measured by gamma counting. K<sub>i </sub>and Hill coefficient (\u201cnH\u201d) were determined by fitting the Hill equation to the measured values with the aid of SIGMAPLOT software (SPSS Inc., Chicago). The binding affinity for the compounds provided herein, expressed as a Ki value, ranged from about 0.1 nanomolar to about 10 micromolar. The most active of these compounds have a Ki of less than 100 nanomolar.</p>Example 12Calcium Mobilization Assay for Determining NPY5 Receptor ModulationThis Example illustrates a representative assay for evaluating the effect of compounds on NPY5 receptor signal transduction.</p>Bowes Melanoma cells stably transfected with an expression vector encoding the NPY5/NPY1 chimeric receptor described above were plated at a density of 26,000 cells/well in FALCON black-walled, clear-bottomed 96-well plates (#3904, BECTON-DICKINSON, Franklin Lakes, N.J.) and grown to confluency, approximately 24 hours. The culture medium was emptied from the 96 well plate, and Fluo-3 calcium sensitive dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.) was added to each well (dye solution: 1 mg FLUO-3 AM, 440 \u03bcL DMSO and 440 \u03bcl 20% pluronic acid in DMSO, diluted 1:2, 50 ul diluted solution per well). Plates were covered with aluminum foil and incubated at 37 C. for 1\u20132 hours. After the incubation, the dye solution was emptied from the plates, cells were washed once in 100 \u03bcl KRH buffer (0.05 mM KCl, 0.115 M NaCl, 9.6 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.01 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) to remove excess dye. After washing, 80 \u03bcl KRH buffer with carbachol/Thomae (KRH buffer containing 1 mM carbachol, 10 micromolar BIBP 3226 (Sigma RBI, St. Louis Mo.)) was added to each well.
