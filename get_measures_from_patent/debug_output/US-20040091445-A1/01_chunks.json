(Daylight CIS), Irvine, Calif., contains many, along with citations to the original literature. However, the logP values are most conveniently calculated by the \u201cCLOGP\u201d program, also available from Daylight CIS. This program also lists experimental logP values when they are available in the Pomona92 database. The \u201ccalculated logP\u201d (ClogP) is determined by the fragment approach of Hansch and Leo (cf., A. Leo, in Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry, Vol. 4, C. Hansch, P. G. Sammens, J. B. Taylor and C. A. Ramsden, Eds., p. 295, Pergamon Press, 1990, incorporated herein by reference). The fragment approach is based on the chemical structure of each perfume ingredient, and takes into account the numbers and types of atoms, the atom connectivity, and chemical bonding. The ClogP values, which are the most reliable and widely used estimates for this physicochemical property, are preferably used instead of the experimental logP values in the selection of perfume ingredients which are useful in the present invention. </p>[0043] In addition to ClogP values, KI values (Kovats Index) may be used to identify perfume raw materials. The Kovats Retention Index system is an accurate method for reporting gas chromatographic data for interlaboratory substance identification. It is used for eliminating the effects of instrument parameters on retention correlations in peak identification by GC. The Kovats Index value of many perfume ingredients has been reported, or can be calculated from the following equation.  \nI=100[n+(N-n)\ue89elog\ue89e\u2003\ue89etr\u2032\ue8a0(unknown)-log\ue89e\u2003\ue89etr\u2032\ue8a0(n)log\ue89e\u2003\ue89etr\u2032\ue8a0(N)-log\ue89e\u2003\ue89etr\u2032\ue8a0(n)<img id=\"EMI-M00001\" path=\"US20040091445A1-20040513-M00001.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/24171222/US/20040513/A1/020040/09/14/45/US20040091445A1-20040513-M00001.TIF\"/>\n</p>[0044] where n is the number of carbon atoms in the smaller alkene; N is the number of carbon atoms in the larger alkene; t\u2032<sub>r</sub>(n) is the adjusted retention time of the smaller alkene; and t\u2032<sub>r</sub>(N) is the adjusted retention time of the larger alkene. It is noted that this equation applies to a particular stationary phase in the GC column. Based on the above equation, the Kovats Index for a linear alkane equal to 100 times the number of carbon atoms. For example, octane has a KI value of 800, and decane would have a KI value of 1000. In another example, octanol has a KI value of 826, on a particular phase and hexadecanol would have a KI value of 1626. The KI value used herein are determined using polydimethylsiloxane as the non-polar stationary phase in the column (referred to as a \u201cDB-5 column\u201d). </p>[0045] This definition makes the Kovats Index (KI) or (RI) for a linear alkane equal to 100 times the number of carbon atoms. For octane I=800, and for decane I=1000. Octanol may be 826 for example on a particular phase and extrapolated to hexadecanol the KI would be 1626. </p>[0046] The perfume associated with the polymeric particle of the present invention comprises PRMs having a molecular weight of less than about 200 and/or a boiling point less than about 250\u00b0 C.

A perfume polymeric particle falls outside the scope of the present invention when all of the following test protocols indicate so. </p>[0057] Protocol IA (Perfume Raw Material Delivery or Longevity Test I): </p>[0058] Each benefit agent delivery system that comprises a perfume raw material and a polymeric particle is tested in accordance with Protocol IA. Each perfume raw material (PRM) commonly found in a perfume is tested with each polymeric particle (PP) to determine if the combination (PRM-PP) demonstrates an enhancement and/or increase in the level of PRM delivered and/or a longevity that is greater than that obtained for the PRM alone. </p>[0",
    "he Longevity Test (LT) are the lowest concentrations, in a series of solutions based on TS<sub>0</sub>, at which each PRM in the test solution is detected in the headspace sample collected from the treated substrate at one or more of the designated time points. If this condition is not met by TS<sub>0</sub>, the concentrations of PRMs and PP in the test solution are doubled and the new solution (TS<sub>1</sub>) is tested in the same manner. The process is repeated until the above PRM detection condition is met. The concentrations of PRMs and PP in the test solution (TS<sub>n</sub>) that meets the above PRM detection condition relate to the concentrations of the PRMs and PP in TS<sub>0 </sub>according to the following equation: </p>[PRM, PP] in TS<sub>n</sub>=2<sup>n</sup>[PRM, PP] in TS<sub>0</sub>; where n=0, 1, 2, 3. </p>[0068] In some instances, the process of doubling the concentration is repeated until the concentration of the PRMs and of PP both exceed 5% by weight of the test solution and the above PRM detection condition is still not met. Then, the following alternatives may be used in conducting the test. The aliquot of TS<sub>n </sub>transferred onto the substrate is increased from 1.0 mL to 3 mL, then to 10 mL, until (i) the above PRM detection condition is met, or (ii) with respect to individual PRM that has a concentration greater than 0.1 wt % of the perfume, at least one of the following two alternative conditions is met: </p>[0069] (1) at least 80% of the low KI PRMs in the test solution and at least 80% of high KI PRMs in the test solution are detected in the headspace sample collected from the treated substrate at one or more of the designated time points; or </p>[0070] (2) at least 10 of the low KI PRMs in the test solution and at least 5 of the high KI PRMs in the test solution are detected in the headspace sample collected from the treated substrate at one or more of the designated time points. </p>[0071] b) The Test Procedure </p>[0072] The test solution is prepared by dissolving or mixing PRM(s) and PP(s) that are to be tested together into a composition at concentrations equal to those used in a consumer product. For example, the respective concentration of PRM(s) and PP(s) in a consumer product may be 2.0% and 4.0%. The solution is closed to the atmosphere and aged for 24 hours at room temperature to obtain the initial test solution, designated TS<sub>0</sub>. </p>[0073] A 4 cm diameter fabric circle, weighing 0.45 to 0.65 g, is cut from an 86/14 cotton/poly terry wash cloth (obtained from EMC, 7616 Reinfold Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio 45237) and used as the test substrate. The weights of substrates in a given test should be within \u00b10.02 g of one another. A 1.0 mL aliquot of TS<sub>0 </sub>is transferred by a pipette onto the substrate, with the pipette pointing close to the center of the substrate. Then, a 1.0 mL aliquot of deionized (DI) water is added to the substrate in the same manner. The substrate is lathered by rubbing against the palm of a nitrile-gloved hand for 1 minute. The substrate is then placed in a bottle containing 40 mL of 35\u00b0 C. DI water; the bottle is capped and shaken for 30 seconds. The substrate is then removed using forceps and gently blotted on paper towels to remove excess water. The substrate",
    "is equivalent to an inert gas (e.g., helium) flow of about 2.4 mL/min. MS conditions are as following: scan range 35 to 400 amu (atomic units). Transfer line is maintained at about 250\u00b0 C. </p>[0083] The quantitative measurements should be reproducible to within 20% of the average from the runs. If the result from a given run is not within said range, the data from said run should be discarded and the test repeated. The average of at least 3 satisfactory runs is reported. </p>[0084] d) Exemplary Results </p>[0085] A given test solution TS<sub>n </sub>meeting the above PRM detection condition or the alternative condition(s) is prepared. A second test solution TS<sub>c </sub>is prepared containing all the components of TS<sub>n </sub>at the same concentrations as in TS<sub>n </sub>except that the polymeric particles are not included. Identical procedure is carried out using a solution (TS<sub>c</sub>) containing no polymeric particles (PPs). The solution TS<sub>c </sub>serves as the control solution in the test. Data are gathered at identical test conditions for a given set of test solution (TS<sub>c </sub>and TS<sub>n</sub>) as described above and analyzed via headspace gas chromatography (HSGC) to determine the amount of each PRM in the headspace at each of the following three designated times: 2, 6 and 24 hours. The following tables demonstrate the type of results that can be obtained from a Longevity Test I.  \nLongevity Test (Time = 24 h):HSGC Area Count for PRM having Low KI* (LKI)value with and without PP<sup>1</sup>PRM<sup>1</sup>PRM<sup>2</sup>PRM<sup>3</sup>TS<sub>c</sub>TS<sub>n</sub>TS<sub>c</sub>TS<sub>n</sub>TS<sub>c</sub>TS<sub>n</sub>38,000418,000250,000250,00055,000275,000RF = 11xRF = 1.0xRF = 4.1xARF<sub>LKI </sub>value = Average Response Factor value (TS<sub>n</sub>/TS<sub>c</sub>) = 5.4HSGC Area Count for PRM having High KI* (HKI)value with and without PP<sup>1</sup>PRM<sup>4</sup>PRM<sup>5</sup>PRM<sup>6</sup>TS<sub>c</sub>TS<sub>n</sub>TS<sub>c</sub>TS<sub>n</sub>TS<sub>c</sub>TS<sub>n</sub>110,000143,00010,00012,000550,000550,000RF = 1.3xRF = 1.2xRF = 1.0xARF<sub>HKI </sub>value = Average Response Factor value (TS<sub>n</sub>/TS<sub>c</sub>) = 1.2\n</p>[0086] wherein RF means Response Factor, which is the ratio of the amount of benefit agent (e.g., perfume raw material) in the headspace collected from TS<sub>n </sub>sample at a specific time point compared to the amount of the same benefit agent in the headspace collected from TS<sub>c </sub>at the same time point; ARF value is the Average Response Factor value, which is the mean of the RFs from all measured PRMs in the test solution. </p>[0087] A Longevity Benefit of a perfume polymeric particle is confirmed for a particular PRM when, at any one of the three designated times points, the RF of the particular PRM is at least about 1.2, preferably at least about 1.6, more preferably at least about 2, even more preferably at least about 3, still more preferably at least about 5, and still even more preferably at least about 10. If the longevity benefit is confirmed, then the perfume polymeric particle falls within the scope of the present invention. </p>[0088] For example, the data in the above tables confirm a longevity benefit for PRM<sup>1 </sup>and PRM<sup>3 </sup>in the presence of PP<sup>1</sup>, because at air drying time equals to 24 h",
    "is greater than the Response Factor observed for any HKI perfume raw material; or </p>[0091] 2. When the Response Factor observed for one or more LKI perfume raw material is greater than the average Response Factor observed for HKI perfume raw materials; or </p>[0092] 3. When the Average Response Factor (ARF) observed for all measured Low Kovats Index (LKI) perfume raw materials (PRMs) is greater than the ARF observed for all measured High Kovats Index (HKI) perfume raw materials (PRMs). </p>[0093] For example, the data in the above tables confirm a longevity benefit for perfume polymeric particles of a PRM mixture (containing PRM<sup>1-6</sup>) and PP<sup>1</sup>. </p>[0094] 4. When the Average Response Factor (ARF) observed for all measured LKI PRMs is at least about 1.2, preferably at least about 1.6, more preferably at least about 2, even more preferably at least about 3, still more preferably at least about 5, and still even more preferably at least about 10 greater than the ARF observed for all measured HKI PRMs. Specifically, the ratio of ARF<sub>LKI </sub>value/ARF<sub>HKI </sub>value also called the selectivity ratio is at least about 1.2, preferably at least about 1.6, preferably at least about 2, more preferably at least about 3, even more preferably at least about 5, still even more preferably at least about 10. Moreover and without wishing to be bound by theory, this selectivity ratio also demonstrates a selectivity or affinity of the polymeric particles for low KI PRMs than high KI PRMs. </p>[0095] Protocol IB (Perfume Accord Delivery or Longevity Test II): </p>[0096] Each benefit agent delivery system that comprises a polymeric particle is tested in accordance with Protocol IB, in which an accord of perfume raw materials are to be tested with each polymer particle (PP) to determine if the combination of PRMs and PP(s) demonstrates an enhancement or increase in the level of PRM(s) delivered to or released from a substrate, or a sustained release time, compared to that obtained for the PRM alone. </p>[0097] Under Protocol IB, total of 20 PRMs (including 10 PRMs having a Kovats Index value between 1000 and 1400 and 10 PRMs having a Kovats Index value greater than 1700, all of which are selected from the representative PRMs table herein above) must be evaluated in the perfume polymeric particles as described in the above Longevity Test for TS<sub>n</sub>. and TS<sub>c </sub>with the following changes. </p>[0098] The relative concentration of each PRM in the mixture of 20 PRMs to be used in the Longevity Test is the concentration at which at least 18 of the 20 PRMs in the test solution is detected by HSGC in at least one of the designated time points (2, 6 or 24 hours). If this condition is not met by TS<sub>0</sub>, the overall concentration of the PRM in the test solution is doubled and the new solution (TS<sub>1</sub>) is tested in the same manner. The process is repeated until the condition is met, provided that the overall concentration of the PRMs ",
    "20 PRMs, the Response Factor value for such PRM(s) shall be defined as 1.0\u00d7. </p>[0100] In addition, if the HSGC area count for a low Kovats Index PRM in TS<sub>c </sub>is zero, e.g., its HSGC area count is below the instruments detection limit, and the HSGC area count for the same low Kovats Index PRM in TS<sub>n </sub>is nonzero, then new test solution should be prepared, as described above, to increase the PRM level in both TS<sub>n </sub>and TS<sub>c</sub>, so as to obtain non-zero values of the HSGC area counts. Should such steps not provide a nonzero value for the PRM in TS<sub>c</sub>, the Response Factor value for such PRM(s) shall be defined as 10\u00d7. </p>[0101] Similarly, should the HSGC area count for high Kovats Index PRM in TS<sub>n </sub>be zero, e.g., its HSGC area count being below the instruments detection limit, and should the HSGC area count for high Kovats Index PRM in TS<sub>c </sub>be non-zero, then steps should be taken, as described above, to increase the PRM level in both TS<sub>n </sub>and TS<sub>c</sub>, so as to obtain non-zero values. Should such steps not provide a nonzero value for the PRM in TS<sub>n</sub>, the PRM shall be replaces by an alternate PRM in the table such that non-negative values is obtained for the Response Factor in both TS<sub>n </sub>and TS<sub>c</sub>. </p>[0102] The following table demonstrates the type of results that can be obtained from a Longevity Test II.  \nLongevity Test (Time = 24 h):HSGC Area Count for PRM having Low KI valuewith and without PP<sup>1</sup>PRM<sup>1</sup>PRM<sup>2</sup>PRM<sup>3</sup>TS<sub>c</sub>TS<sub>n</sub>TS<sub>c</sub>TS<sub>n</sub>TS<sub>c</sub>TS<sub>n</sub>ND418,000250,000250,00055,000275,000RF = TS<sub>n</sub>/RF = TS<sub>n</sub>/RF = TS<sub>n</sub>/TS<sub>c </sub>= 10xTS<sub>c </sub>= 1.0xTS<sub>c </sub>= 4.1xARF<sub>LKI </sub>value = Average Response Factor value (TS<sub>n</sub>/TS<sub>c</sub>) = 5.0\n</p>[0103] Polymeric particles fall within the scope of the present invention when the ARF observed for 10 of the Low Kovats Index (LKI) PRMs is greater than the ARF observed for 10 of the High Kovats Index (HKI) PRMs. Specifically, the ratio of ARF<sub>LKI </sub>value/ARF<sub>HKI </sub>value also called the selectivity ratio is at least about 1.2, preferably at least about 1.6, preferably at least about 2, more preferably at least about 3, even more preferably at least about 5, still even more preferably at least about 10. Moreover, this selectivity ratio also demonstrates a selectivity or affinity of the polymeric particles for low KI PRMs than high KI PRMs. </p>[0104] Polymeric Particle Affinity Test </p>[0105] The polymeric particles useful in the personal care compositions of the present invention encompass cationic polymeric particles comprising a cationic polymer that exhibits a greater affinity for a perfume raw material having a molecular weight of less than about 200 and/or a boiling point of less than about 250\u00b0 C. and/or a ClogP of less than about 3 and/or a Kovats Index value of less than about 1700 than other perfume raw materials. To determine if a cationic polymeric particle falls within the scope of the present invention, the following Polymeric Particle Affinity Test Protocol II has been provided. </p>[0106] Polymeric Particle Affinity Test Protocol II </p>[0107] An aqueous dispersion of the polymeric particles is thoroughly mixed with perfume oil and then separated via ultra centrifugation for 16 hours at 40,000 rpm. Subsequent to centrifugation, the contents separate into distinguishable layers, e.g. perfume oil (top), aqueous layer (middle), and particle layer (bottom). A sample from each layer is extracted with a suitable organic solvent (e.g. acetone) and analyzed via GC/MS for perfume identification using the instrument conditions given above. A polymeric particle material that exhibits the properties of the present invention will show selectivity toward perfume raw materials contained in the particle layer having a molecular weight of less than about 200 and/or a boiling point of less than about 25",
    "d with water or rinsed. A longevity benefit is confirmed for a particular polymeric particle (PP) when the quantitative amount of any PRM in the headspace from TS<sub>n </sub>at any one of the designated times points is greater than the amount of the same PRM in the headspace from TS<sub>c </sub>at the corresponding time point. For direct addition application, the polymeric particle can serve to \u201cflatten\u201d the release profile of the perfume raw materials when present in the perfume delivery system. This can result in the initial headspace count of a PRM with PP present to be lower than the headspace count of a PRM with no PP present. At initial or later time points however, the longevity benefit is observed. Preferably, the polymeric particles of the present invention increase the longevity of PRMs having a Kovat Index of less than 1700, and more preferably increase the longevity of PRMs having a Kovat Index of less than 1500 to a greater extent than PRMs have a Kovat Index greater than 1700. </p>[0172] The following table demonstrates the type of results that can be obtained from a Longevity Test with Direct Applications. The data confirms a longevity benefit for PRM<sup>1 </sup>(at t=6 h, the area count from TS<sub>n</sub>&gt;TS<sub>c</sub>) and PRM<sup>2 </sup>(at t=2 and 6 h, the area count from TS<sub>n</sub>&gt;TS<sub>c</sub>) in the presence of polymeric particle (PP).  \nHSGC Area Count for BenefitAgent with and without PPPRM<sup>1 </sup>PRM<sup>2</sup>PRM<sup>3 </sup>(KI = 1033)(KI = 1122)(KI = 1770)Time (h)TS<sub>c</sub>TS<sub>n</sub>TS<sub>c</sub>TS<sub>n</sub>TS<sub>c</sub>TS<sub>n</sub>2300025002010008507006\u20027501500ND\u2002150\u200225ND24ND\u200350NDNDNDND\n</p>[0173] Further, in addition to rinse-off types of applications, such as is the focus of the present invention, leave-on types of applications may incorporate the polymeric particles and/or perfume polymeric particles of the present invention. </p>[0174] Preferred may be a product that contains greater than 10% by weight of moisture (water). The perfume polymeric particle may be present in the personal care composition at any suitable level, typically it is present at a level of at least 0.1%, preferably from about 0.1% to about 20%, more preferably from about 1% to about 10% by weight of the personal care composition. In addition to the perfume polymeric particle, it is desirable to incorporate a separate, water-soluble charged polymeric component. It is further preferred that polymer have a charge density of at least about 0.4 meq/gm and less than about 7 meq/gm. </p>[0175] Additionally, a method of depositing perfume polymeric particles onto human skin, hair or nails comprising the steps of applying the personal care compositions as described herein to the skin, hair and/or nails and rinsing off is also provided. </p>[0176] The present invention may be a rinse-off personal care composition, which effectively deposits perfume having a molecular weight of less than about 200, and/or a boiling point of less than abou"
