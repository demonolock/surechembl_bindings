Design and expression ofsFvform of 77 A3</p>The sFv fragment of an antibody is most commonly obtained by the tandem expression of the variable region of the antibody heavy chain along with the variable region of the antibody light chain spaced by a linker of 15-20 amino acids. sFv fragments are expected to have superior clot penetration to parent antibodies. Two constructs, p53-6 and p52-12, were prepared using murine variable regions with a VH-(linker)-VL polarity using YPRSIYLRRRHPSPSLTT (SEQ LD NO:73) as linker 1 for sFv77A3-l and GGSGSGGSGSGGSGS (SEQ LD NO.74) as linker 2 for sFv77A3-2. Both constructs were cloned into the pET-22b vector from Novagen and transformed into the BL21 (DE3) strain of E. coli grown in minimal M9 media. Though the majority of the His-tagged product was found in inclusion bodies, supernatants of cell lysate contained sufficient quantities of soluble sFv fragments for nickel-column purification. \n\n sFv77A3-2 present in fractions 7-11 collected from a nickel-column gave a single Coomasie staining band with a MW about 30,000 agreeing well with the calculated MW of 29,986. A similar but more weakly staining gel was obtained for sFv77A3-l.</p>B. Activity of sFv77A3-l and sFv77A3-2</p>Preparations of both sFv77A3-l and sFv77A3-2 were tested for alpha2- antiplasmin binding activity in a competition binding assay. Microplate wells coated with 77 A3 were treated with mixtures of biotinylated-human alpha2- antiplasmin and either sFv77A3-l or sFv77A3-2 along with positive control 77 A3 and negative control, mAb-59D8. Increasing quantities of 77 A3 prevented binding of biotinylated-human alpha2-antiplasmin whereas negative control 59D8 had little effect as an competitive inhibitor. With concentrations of test samples estimated by intensity of Coomasie stained bands, both sFv77A3-l and sFv77A3-2 completely inhibited the binding of biotinylated-human \u03b12-antiplasmin with a profile of inhibition nearly superimposible to the parental 77 A3 reference.</p>Idiotypic markers present on 77 A3 were probed with a sandwich ELISA using a biotinylated polyclonal reagent rendered specific by multiple immunoadsorbtion steps through columns bearing immunoglobulins from man, mouse, baboon and cynomologous monkey (P Stenzel-Johnson &amp; D Yelton, Seattle). Microplate wells were coated with 77 A3 and 59D8 as controls along with sFv77A3-l and sFv77A3-2. It is evident that 77A3 control and both sFv fragments bear idiotypic markers at each dose tested indicating that the sFv fragments \"look\" like the parental 77A3.</p>It will be clear that the invention may be practiced otherwise than as particularly described in the foregoing description and examples. \n\n Numerous modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings and, therefore, are within the scope"
