    "ctum, testis, and bone and from melanoma.</p>\n  Preferably, the lymphoma is Hodgkin's Disease, small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL/CLL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) including extranodal (MALT lymphoma), nodal (monocytoid B-cell lymphoma) or splenic, diffuse large cell lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, high grade Burkitt-like lymphoma or lymphoblastic lymphoma.</p>\n  Recombinant INSP215 and the INSP215 polypeptides identified herein may be used to generate specific monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies that might then be used in the biochemical characterization of INSP215, as well as for diagnostic and/or therapeutic applications (in view of the information disclosed in the literature on fragments generated from these family of proteins). Alternatively, recombinant INSP215, and the INSP215 polypeptides identified herein, may be used in a wide variety of screening assays, in particular involving proteins included in the TGF-beta protein superfamily, for identifying specific ligands and associated biological activities.</p>\n  Preferably, the activity of a soluble polypeptide of the present invention, alone or as part of a fusion protein, or an antagonist of a membrane bound polypeptide of the present invention, can be confirmed in at least one of the following assays:</p>\n  a) in the modulation of apoptosis (for example by tunnel staining of activated caspase 3 by IHC), or</p>\n  b) in the modulation of cell proliferation (e.g. use of Ki-67 or PCNA by IHC), or</p>\n  c) in the modulation of angiogenesis or neovascularization (e.g. CD34 by immunohistochemistry (IHC), or</p>\n  d) in the modulation of immunosuppression (e.g. NK cell activity, T-cell activation, macrophage activation markers by IHC), or</p>\n  e) in the modulation of cell migration (e.g. markers of EMT by IHC, vimentin, E- cadherin, SNAIL), or \n\n f) in the modulation of tumour-host interaction (e.g. growth-factor pathway activation; HGF, EGF, PDGF, VEGF), or</p>\n  g) in the modulation of tumour growth, or</p>\n  h) in the modulation of metastasis, or</p>\n  i) in the modulation of cell survival, or</p>\n  j) in the modulation of oocyte maturation, or</p>\n  k) in the modulation of follicular growth, or</p>\n  1) in the assay as described in Example 4 herein, or</p>\n  m) in the syngeneic murine 4Tl mammary carcinoma model, or</p>\n  n) in the floxed TGFBR2 allele mouse model, or</p>\n  o) in mouse models of metastatic breast cancer (e.g. the MMTV/Neu mice), or</p>\n  p) in rabbits subjected to modified glaucoma surgery, or</p>\n  q) in a rat model of diabetes, or</p>\n  r) in rats with established intracranial gliomas, or</p>\n  s) in the C6 rat glioma model, or</p>\n  t) in a rat model of Bronchiolitis obliterans as described by Liu et al. (Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2002. Vol.165, pp.419-423), or</p>\n  u) in the xenograft model as described by Bandyopadhyay et al.
