    "sing hybridoma technology. For an overview of the technology for producing human antibodies, see Lonberg and Huszar, 1995, Int. Rev. Immunol. 13:65-93. For a detailed discussion of this technology for producing human antibodies and human monoclonal antibodies and protocols for producing such antibodies, see, e.g., PCT publications WO 98/24893; WO 92/01047; WO 96/34096; WO 96/33735; European Patent No. 0 598, 877; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,413,923; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; 5,569,825; 5,661,016; 5,545,806; 5,814,318; 5,885,793; 5,916,771; and 5,939,598.</p>Antibodies can be assayed for specific binding to CD70 by known methods, such as for example, competitive and non-competitive immunoassay systems using techniques such as Western blots, radioimmunoassays, ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), \u201csandwich\u201d immunoassays, immunoprecipitation assays, precipitin reactions, gel diffusion precipitin reactions, immunodiffusion assays, agglutination assays, complement-fixation assays, immunoradiometric assays, fluorescent immunoassays, protein A immunoassays. (See, e.g., Ausubel et al., eds., Short Protocols in Molecular Biology (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, 4th ed. 1999); Harlow &amp; Lane, Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N. Y., 1999.)</p>Further, the binding affinity of an antibody to CD70 and the off-rate of an antibody CD70 interaction can be determined by competitive binding assays. One example of a competitive binding assay is a radioimmunoassay comprising the incubation of labeled CD70 (e.g., <sup>3</sup>H or <sup>125</sup>I) with the antibody of interest in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled CD70, and the detection of the antibody bound to the labeled CD70. The affinity of the antibody for CD70 and the binding off-rates can then be determined from the data by Scatchard plot analysis. Competition with a second antibody can also be determined using radioimmunoassays. In this case, CD70 is incubated with the antibody of interest conjugated to a labeled compound (e.g., <sup>3</sup>H or <sup>125</sup>I) in the presence of increasing amounts of an unlabeled second antibody. Alternatively, the binding affinity of an antibody to CD70 and the on- and off-rates of an antibody-CD70 interaction can be determined by surface plasmon resonance.</p>Antibodies can be made from antigen-containing fragments of the CD70 protein by standard procedures according to the type of antibody (see, e.g., Kohler, et al., Nature, 256:495, (1975); Harlow &amp; Lane, Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual (C.S.H.P., NY, 1988); Queen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:10029-10033 (1989) and WO 90/07861; Dower et al., WO 91/17271 and McCafferty et al., WO 92/01047 (each of which is incorporated by reference for all purposes). As an example, monoclonal antibodies can be prepared using a wide variety of techniques including, e.g., the use of hybridoma, recombinant, and phage display technologies, or a combi"
