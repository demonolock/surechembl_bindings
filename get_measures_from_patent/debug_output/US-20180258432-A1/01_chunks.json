In some embodiments, the PDGF aptamer is an aptamer with a K<sub>d </sub>that is less than or equal to the K<sub>d </sub>of an aptamer shown in Table 1 or Table 6.</p>Aptamer 4149-8_1 binds in a 1:1 stoichiometry with a PDGF monomer. Since PDGF forms a tight homodimer that is required for reaction with its target receptors, a more efficient inhibition of PDGF activity might be achieved by using a dimeric or other multimeric form of aptamer 4149-8_1. Thus, in some embodiments, the PDGF aptamer is a multimerization of any combination of the sequences of aptamer 4149-8_1, 4149-8_379, and SEQ ID NOS 500 to 512. In some embodiments, an aptamer construct comprises a first aptamer selected from any of the PDGF aptamers described herein, and a second aptamer comprising any of the PDGF aptamers described herein, wherein the first aptamer and the second aptamer may be the same or different.

(2003) J. Clin. Invest. 111:1287; Jo, N., et al. (2006) Am. J. Pathol. 168:2036). This effect is mediated by the disruption of tight cell-cell association between endothelial cells, which form initial capillary sprouts, and periendothelial cells (or pericytes), which encircle the new blood vessels as they mature, rendering the blood vessels less susceptible to VEGF inh",
    "to binding, we performed another series of systematic point substitutions by chemically synthesizing 5-position variants with a custom-made library of modified dU phosphoramidites. For this purpose, we designed a library to allow us to probe the microenvironment of each of the positions by varying the size, polarity, disposition of H-bond donors and acceptors, linker length, and orientation of the 5-position substituents. In choosing the functional groups for this analysis, we aimed to include variations on a theme of the original modification (in this case, the benzyl group), amino acid side chains overrepresented in complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of antibodies (like tryptophan and tyrosine) (Mian, I S, et al. (1991) J. Mol. Biol. 217:133; Ramaraj T. et al. (2012) Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1824:520), and \u201cprivileged\u201d fragments of small-molecule drugs (Welsch et al. (2010) Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 14:347). In a sense, we endeavored to combine elements of affinity maturation in antibodies and structure-activity relationship (SAR) optimization in medicinal chemistry. Although we utilized a single modified nucleotide during SELEX, post-SELEX optimization is constrained only by the synthetic accessibility of the modified monomers and compatibility with solid-phase synthesis.</p>The effect of individual substitutions of the benzyl group with fourteen alternative moieties at the 5-position is summarized in FIGS. 1C and D, and FIG. 6B, with relative affinities expressed as dissociation constant ratios and relative PDGF R\u03b2 phosphorylation expressed as percent phospho-PDGF R\u03b2 ratios. Substitution with dT, which only has a methyl group at the 5-position, represents the most drastic change, and in that sense is comparable to alanine scanning mutagenesis in proteins (Cunningham, B. C. et al. (1989) Science 243:1330). Not surprisingly, this was the least tolerated substitution at six of the eight modified nucleotide positions. The exceptions were nucleotides 1 and 7, where this substitution was well-tolerated. These two positions also tolerated many other substitutions, with some replacements yielding up to 5-fold improvement in binding affinity (FIG. 6B). In contrast, nucleotides 8, 17 and 18 exhibited the highest sensitivity to changes. The best single substitutions were then combined, yielding additional variants including 4149-8_255 and 4149-8_260 (FIG. 6B). Aptamer 4149-8_260, which combined phenethyl-dU (Pe-dU) at nucleotide 17 and thiophene-dU (Th-dU) at nucleotide 18, showed excellent binding to both PDGF-BB and PDGF-AB (FIG. 6B). It is worth noting that the affinity of the originally selected SOMAmer was already so high (K<sub>d</sub>=20 pM) that it approached the detection limit of the binding assay, so it is possible that the degree of affinity improvement is underestimated. We have applied similar post-SELEX optimization strategies to other SOMAmers with weaker initial binding (e.g., K<sub>d </sub>values ranging from 100 pM to &gt;10 nM), and have observed affinity improvements of up to 100-fold.</p>Homodimers of PDGF Aptamer 4149-8_260 (SL5):</p>Since PDGF forms a covalently linked homodimer, and two SOMAmers bind to each PDGF homodimer, we determined the effect on binding of homodimerized SOMAmers. The affinity of the PDGF aptamer homodimers could be substantially improved compared to the affinity of the corresponding monomers, due to avidity effects. The crystal structure showed that the 5\u2032 ends of the SOMAmer were 38 \u212b apart, while the 3\u2032 ends were 74 \u212b apart. Connecting the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 end would require at least 63 \u212b since the shortest path between the two points bisected the protein. Two types of homodimers were ordered, based on readily available chemistry. These were 1) head-to-tail homodimers connected by two to six Heg linkers, which provide \u02dc20 \u212b distance per Heg, and 2) 3\u2032-3\u2032 homodimers connected via a synthetic doubler support, combined with one to three Hegs. The homodimers of 4149-8_260 were tested in the PDGF-BB Zorbax binding assay. The binding assay was performed with limiting amount of SOMAmer, and would not distinguish binding of one SOMAmer per protein dimer versus binding of two SOMAmers per protein dimer. The structure of the homodimers is shown in Table 1 (sequences 4149-8_334 through 4149-8_342). The K<sub>d </sub>values obtained in the Zorbax assay suggested that in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 configuration, a longer linker was desirable, and gave up to 10-fold improvement in binding affinity, as shown in Table 1a. In the 3\u2032-3\u2032 linked homodimers, the shorter linker actually appeared to perform better than the longer linker. This was corroborated by cellular phosphorylation results, see Table 1a.</p>Based on these sequences, an exemplary consensus sequence is:</p>5\u2032-ZZVCL<sub>n</sub>GV\u2032ZACNMGCGZZZAZAGCG-3\u2032\u2003\u2003(SEQ ID NO: 502),\n</p>wherein\n\nV is selected from an A, C or G;\n\nV\u2032 is selected from a C, G or Z, wherein V\u2032 is complementary to V;\n\nN is independently selected from any naturally occurring or modified nucleotide;\n\nM is selected from a C or A;\n\nZ is independently selected from a modified pyrimidine; L is a spacer selected from any naturally occurring or modified nucleotide, a hydrocarbon linker, a polyethylene glycol linker or a combination thereof; and\n\nn is 0 to 20;\n\nwherein one or more nucleotide insertions are optionally included.\n</p>Sequence Truncation Studies:</p>Systematic truncation from the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of 4149-8_1 was performed to define a minimum length required to retain full binding activity of t",

Homodimer Constructs of PDGF and VEGF AptamersBoth PDGF-BB and VEGF are disulfide linked homodimers that exert their biological effects by dimerizing their tyrosine kinase receptors leading to receptor autophosphorylation and signal transduction. If more than one aptamer can bind to its protein target, as is the case with PDGF-BB aptamer 4149-8_260 (based on the crystal structures), such aptamers can be covalently linked in a multimeric construct in a manner that permits simultaneous binding of individual aptamer subunits to the protein. This can lead to improvement in affinity through avidity effect. Two types of homodimers were synthesized, based on readily available chemistry. These were 1) head-to-tail homodimers connected by zero to six Heg linkers, which provide \u02dc20 \u212b distance per Heg, and 2) 3\u2032-3\u2032 homodimers connected via a synthetic doubler support, combined with one to three Hegs on each side (that is, two, four or six Hegs total in the dimer). The homodimers of 4149-8_379, 5169-4_26 and 4867-31_192 were tested in a competition binding assay. For determination of competitor binding affinities, aptamer ligands were 5\u2032 end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and \u03b3-<sup>32</sup>P-ATP (Perkin Elmer). Competition assays were performed by pre-mixing a fixed concentration of radiolabeled ligand (1.0 nM) with varying concentrations of competitor aptamer (10<sup>\u221211 </sup>to 10<sup>\u22126 </sup>M). The ligand and competitor dilutions were incubated with the target protein (100 pM) in 1\u00d7SB18T buffer (40 mM HEPES, pH 7.5; 120 mM NaCl; 5 mM KCl; 5 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>and 0.01% TWEEN-20) at 37\u00b0 C. for 60 minutes. Bound complexes were mixed with Zorbax resin and captured on Durapore filter plates. The fraction of ligand bound was quantified with a PhosphorImager (FUJI FLA-3000). Raw binding data were normalized to binding without addition of competitor. Data were plotted in GraphPad Prism 3.0 and fit to a one site competition curve using nonlinear regression to determine the equilibrium dissociation constants for the competitor aptamers (K<sub>i</sub>). PDGF Homodimers: The structure of the PDGF homodimers of sequences 4149-8_379 (sequences 4149-8_438 through 4149-8_447) and 5169-4_26 (sequences 5169-4_134 through 5169-4_143) are shown in Table 15. For the 4149-8_379 based homodimers, the K<sub>i </sub>values obtained in the competition assay suggested that in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 configuration, a longer linker was desirable, since a greater than 10-fold improvement in binding affinity was measured w",
    "reous Humor:</p>Polyacrylamide-gel-purified aptamers at a final concentration of 500 nM were incubated in 90% pooled vitreous humor from New Zealand White rabbits (Bioreclamation IIC, Cat No. RAB-VITHUM. Samples were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. in a total reaction volume of 200 \u03bcL (samples also contained a final concentration of 0.067% phosphate buffered saline). At various time points, a 20 \u03bcL aliquot was collected and the reaction stopped by adding an equal volume of 2\u00d7 gel loading buffer (93.85% formamide, 0.03% SDS, 20 mM Na<sub>2</sub>EDTA, 0.01% xylene cylanol and 0.01% Orange G). Samples were stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. until processed. To each sample 100 \u03bcL of water was added followed by 150 \u03bcL of 25:24:1 Phenol/Chloroform/Isoamyl alcohol (AMRESCO). Samples were mixed and centrifuged at 16,100\u00d7g for 15 minutes. The aqueous phase was collected and frozen at \u221220\u00b0 C. until gel analysis. Samples (15 \u03bcL) were loaded onto a 15% TBE polyacrylamide denaturing gel (8 M urea) and electrophoresis performed for approximately 20 minutes at 200 V. Gels were stained with approximately 2 \u03bcM SYBR\u00ae Gold (Molecular Probes, Cat No. S11494) for 10 minutes to visualize the bands. The amount of full-length SOMAmer remaining at each time point was quantified using FlourChem\u00ae Q analysis software (Alpha Innotech). If necessary, the intensity of each band was determined following a background subtraction and data presented as a percentage remaining of full-length input DNA at the zero time point.</p>Competition Binding Assay Methods:</p>Aptamers to be used as ligands in the competition binding assay were 5\u2032-end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and \u03b3-[<sup>32</sup>P]ATP (Perkin Elmer). The competition assay was performed by combining equal volumes of 2 nM ligand with unlabeled competitor (concentrations ranging from 10<sup>\u22126 </sup>to 10<sup>\u221211 </sup>M) in 1\u00d7SB18T buffer [40 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.01% TWEEN-20]. Human PDGF-BB (Creative Biomart) at a concentration of 200 pM in 1\u00d7SB18T buffer was added to the ligand/competitor mixtures and the reactions were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 40 minutes. Bound complexes were mixed with Zorbax\u00ae resin (Agilent Technologies) and captured on Durapore\u00ae filter plates. The signal in each well was quantified with a PhosphorImager (FUJI FLA-3000). Raw binding data were corrected for background signal and normalized to fraction bound for no competitor. To determine the inhibitor constants (K<sub>i</sub>), the data were plotted in GraphPad Prism\u00ae 6 and fit to a one-site competition curve.</p>Example 15.
