    "inkers with a length of 5 residues are used to generate these dimers. This type is known as \"diabodies\". Still shorter linkers (one or two amino acids) between a V H and V L domain lead to the formation of monospecific trimers, so-called \"triabodies\" or \"tribadies\". Bispecific diabodies are formed by expressing to chains with the arrangement VHA-VLB and VHB-VLA or VLA-VHB and VLB-VHA, respectively. Singlechain diabodies (scDb) comprise a VHA-VLB and a VHB-VLA fragment which are linked by a linker peptide (P) of 12-20 amino acids, preferably 14 amino acids, (VHA-VLB-P-VHB-VLA). \"Bi-specific T-cell engagers (BiTEs)\" are fusion proteins consisting of two scFvs of different antibodies wherein one of the scFvs binds to T cells via the CD3 receptor, and the other to a tumor cell via a tumor specific molecule (Kufer et al. (2004) Trends Biotechnol. 22:238-244). Dual affinity retargeting molecules (\"DART\" molecules) are diabodies additionally stabilized through a C-terminal disulfide bridge. </p> The term \"binding affinity\" generally refers to the strength of the sum total of noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g., an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, \"binding affinity\" refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1 : 1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., antibody and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (Kd). Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art, including but not limited to surface plasmon resonance based assay (such as the BIAcore assay as described in PCT Application Publication No. WO2005/012359); enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA); and competition assays (e.g. RIA's). Low-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to dissociate readily, whereas high-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain bound longer. A variety of methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art, any of which can be used for purposes of the present invention. Specific illustrative and exemplary embodiments for measuring binding affinity are described in the following. </p> The \"Kd\" or \"Kd-value\" according to this invention is measured by a radiolabeled antigen- binding assay (RIA) performed with the Fab version of an antibody of interest and its antigen as described by the following assay. Solution-binding affinity of Fabs for antigen is measured by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of (125I)-labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen, then capturing bound antigen with an anti-Fab antibody-coated plate (see, e.g., Chen et al., J. Mol. Biol. 293:865-881 (1999)). To establish conditions for the assay, microtiter \n\n plates (DYNEX Technologies, Inc.) are coated overnight with 5 \u03bcg/ml of a capturing anti-Fab antibody (Cappel Labs) in 50 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.6), and subsequently blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature (approximately 23\u00b0C). In a non- adsorbent plate (Nunc #269620), 100 pM or 26 pM [1251] -antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest (e.g., consistent with assessment of the anti-VEGF antibody, Fab- 12, in Presta et al., Cancer Res. 57:4593-4599 (1997)). The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight; however, the incubation may continue for a longer period (e.g., about 65 hours) to ensure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter, the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature (e.g., for one hour). The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1% TWEEN-20TM surfactant in PBS. When the plates have dried, 150 \u03bc\u0390/well of scintillant (MICRO SCINT-20TM; Packard) is added, and the plates are counted on a TOPCOUNTTM gamma counter (Packard) for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20%&gt; of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays. </p> The Kd or Kd- value may also be measured by using surface-plasmon resonance assays using a BIACORE\u00ae-2000 or a BIACORE\u00ae-3000 instrument (BlAcore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) at 25\u00b0C with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at -10 response units (RU). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BlAcore Inc.) are activated with N-ethyl-N'- (3-dimethylaminopropyl)- carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, to 5 \u03bcg/ml (-0.2 \u03bc\u039c) before injection at a flow rate of 5 \u03bc\u0390/minute to achieve approximately ten response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen, 1 M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% TWEEN 20TM surfactant (PBST) at 25\u00b0C at a flow rate of approximately 25 \u03bc\u0390/min. Association rates (kon) and dissociation rates (koff) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BlAcore\u00ae Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneously fitting the association and dissociation sensorgrams. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) is calculated as the ratio koff/kon. See, e.g., Chen et al., J. Mol. Biol. 293:865-881 (1999). If the on-rate exceeds 106 M-ls-1 by the surface- plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence-emission intensity (excitation = 295 nm; emission = 340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25\u00b0C of a 20 nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow-equipped spectrophotometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-AMINCOTM spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stirred cuvette. </p> An \"on-rate,\" \"rate of association,\" \"association rate,\" or \"kon\" can also be determined as described above using a BIACORE\u00ae-2000 or a BIACORE\u00ae-3000 system (BlAcore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ). </p> Typically, antibodies bind with a sufficient binding affinity to their target, for example, with a Kd value of between 500 nM-1 pM, i.e. 500nM, 450 nM, 400nM, 350 nM, 300nM, 250 nM, 200nM, \n\n 150 nM, \u0399\u039f\u039f\u03b7\u039c, 50 nM, 1 nM, 900 M, 800 pM, 700 pM, 600 pM, 500 pM, 400 pM, 300 pM, 200 pM, 100 pM, 50 pM, lpM. </p> The term \"pharmaceutically acceptable salt\" refers to a salt of a compound identifiable by the methods of the present invention or a compound of the present invention. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts include acid addition salts which may, for example, be formed by mixing a solution of compounds of the present invention with a solution of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, benzoic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, carbonic acid or phosphoric acid. Furthermore, where the compound carries an acidic moiety, suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may include alkali metal salts (e.g., sodium or potassium salts); alkaline earth metal salts (e.g., calcium or magnesium salts); and salts formed with suitable organic ligands (e.g., ammonium, quaternary ammonium and amine cations formed using counteranions such as halide, hydroxide, carboxylate, sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, alkyl sulfonate and aryl sulfonate). Illustrative examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, acetate, adipate, alginate, ascorbate, aspartate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bicarbonate, bisulfate, bitartrate, borate, bromide, butyrate, calcium edetate, camphorat",
    "ample 3 : Fluorescence anisotropy </p> To further characterise the interaction of the CTD with FluA and FluB polymerases fluorescence anisotropy binding experiments were performed using fluorophore-labelled peptides with 2 (14-mer) or 4 (28-mer) repeats. Binding assays were performed with CTD peptides, fluorescently labelled with FAM at the N-terminal end and consisting of different number of repeats of the consensus sequence (Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7). 2- and 4-repeats (14 and 28 amino acids, respectively) Ser-5 phosphorylated peptides and 4-repeats non-phosphorylated peptide were used (Covalab). Peptides were titrated with increasing concentrations of wild-type polymerase or the corresponding mutants in 50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mM MgC12, 2 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), pH 7.5. The proteins were pre-mixed with the vRNA promoter, 5'-pAGUAGAAACAAGG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 24) and 3\u038c\u0397- GCCUGCUUCUGCU-5' (SEQ ID NO: 25) for bat FluA and 5 '-p AGUAGUAACAAGAG-3 ' (SEQ ID NO: 26) and 3 'OH-CUCUGCUUCUGCU-5 ' (SEQ ID NO: 27) for FluB, with one exception (indicated). Fluorescence anisotropy was measured at 23\u00b0C with a fluorescence spectrometer (Photon Technology International). The observed fluorescence anisotropy was plotted. Dissociation constants were obtained by fitting the data to a 1 : 1 binding model using the following equation: \n\n \n\n </p>(fb - fractional concentration of bound peptide, L - total concentration of fluorescent peptide, P -total concentration of protein, KD - dissociation constant). For the displacement assay 0.5 \u03bc\u039c FluA polymerase :vRNA complex was incubated with 0.5 \u03bc\u039c fluorescently labelled Ser-5 phosphorylated CTD peptide and titrated with increasing amount of non-labelled Ser-5 phosphorylated CTD peptide. The apparent KD was calculated using the same binding model equation. </p> We derived a KD of 0.9 \u03bc\u039c for the 28-mer SeP5 peptide binding to the bat FluA polymerase- vRNA promoter complex (Fig. 3C). A similar KD was obtained by displacing bound labelled peptide by an unlabelled peptide (Fig.5A). The binding was independent of vRNA promoter binding (Fig.5B), consistent with the peptide binding site being on the exterior of the structurally stable core of the polymerase, distant from the vRNA binding site and from flexibly linked peripheral domains 18 and also consistent with previous results showing that vRNA is not required for CTD binding (Engelhardt et al. 2005, Journal of virology 79:5812-5818; Loucaides et al. 2009, Virology 394:154-163). For 14- mer SeP5 and unphosphorylated 28-mer Ser5 peptides we measured KD'S of 6.1 and &gt; 10 \u03bc\u039c, respectively (Fig.3C, Fig.5C). This implies a &gt;10-fold higher affinity for Ser5 phosphorylated compared to non-phosphorylated CTD repeats and a tighter binding to four compared to two repeats. The latter result is consistent with the crystal structure, which suggests that four consecutive repeats can bind across both sites and with the expected avidity effect of fusing independent ligands. FluB polymerase did not discriminate between different length Sep5 peptides (KD'S of 2.9 and 4.2 for 28-mer SePs and 14-mer SePs, respectively)(Fig 3D). </p>Example 4: In vitro polymerase activity assays </p> To assess the importance of the CTD interaction for viral replication, we mutated the conserved basic residues forming the positively charged phosphoserine binding sites. We first expressed and purified recombinant bat polymerase with double mutants in either site 1 (K630A+R633A) or site 2 (K289A+R449A). The affinity to the four-repeat SeP5 peptide decreased by around 4-fold and 7.5-fold for the K289A+R449A and K630A+R633A mutants respectively (Fig.6A, Fig.7A). The corresponding mutant in FluB (K631A+R634A) had a 2.5-fold decrease in the binding affinity to the CTD (Fig 6A, Fig.7B). Polymerase containing all four mutations (K289A, R449A, K630A and R633A) could not be produced recombinantly and studies using fluorescently labelled polymerase subunits expressed in mammalian cells showed that it is not properly localized in the nucleus, unlike the other mutants (data not shown). </p> Three types of RNA synthesis assays were performed in order to compare the intrinsic enzymatic activity of the FluA polymerase CTD binding mutants: cap-primed transcription-like and unprimed replication-like using v- or cRNA as a template. For each assay, 0.25 \u03bc\u039c bat FluA polymerase, pre- \n\n mixed with 5' vRNA (5 '-pAGUAGUAACAAGAG-3 ') (SEQ ID NO: 28) or 5' cRNA (5'- pAGCAGAAGCAGAGG-3 ') (SEQ ID NO: 29), was added to 0.15 \u03bc\u039c fluorescently labelled template 3' vRNA (5'-F",
    "ns and corresponds to residue 1545 in bat FluA, which makes key hydrophobic interactions with CTD residues Tyric and Pro6<sub>C</sub> in CTD binding site 2 (Fig.2D, 8D). These observations suggest that conservative substitution of this residue can subtly modulate, without eliminating, CTD binding with consequent \n\n knock-on effects on polymerase activity, Pol II degradation and virulence. Thirdly, PA residue 552 near the tip of the 550-loop, which is almost exclusively threonine in avian (and bat, T547) or serine in human FluA polymerases is also part of binding site 2, being very close to CTD residue Ser7b (Fig. 8D). The single PA mutation T552S (avian to human signature) is sufficient to 20-fold enhance the activity of an otherwise impaired avian polymerase in human cells (Mehle et al. 2012, Journal of virology 86:1750- 1757). Taken together, we conclude that only minor perturbations in CTD binding site residues (e.g. I550L or T552S) can have biologically significant effects. This is consistent with our findings that relatively drastic mutations (e.g. double knockout of both phosphoserine binding basic residues) lead to non- viable virus and even single mutants lead to highly attenuated virus, despite that the in vitro binding of the double mutant polymerases to the CTD is only reduced 4-8 fold (Fig.6A, Fig.7A). These considerations point to the need for fine tuning of the affinity of the viral polymerase for Pol II CTD relative to competing host factors. Comparison of the KD for FluA polymerase binding to SePs CTD peptide repeats (0.9 \u03bc\u039c) with those for other relevant CTD binding proteins e.g. the mammalian capping enzyme (Mcel), KD ~ 139 \u03bc\u039c24, Pinl proline isomerase, KD ~ 30 \u03bc\u039c (Verdecia et al. 2000, Nat Struct Biol 7:639-643) and Ssu72 Sep5 phosphatase, KM ~ 280 \u03bc\u039c (Xiang et al. 2010, Nature 467:729-733; Hausmann et al. 2005, The Journal of biological chemistry 280:37681-37688). Table 2 shows that the affinity of the viral polymerase to the CTD is amongst the highest so far reported. This suggests that FluPol can compete strongly for CTD binding and potentially prevent other factors binding, notably those (e.g. Ssu72 and Pinl) which promote transition to the elongation phase. </p>Example 8: Construct design / cloning of H7N9 polymerase core </p> A co-expression construct for the influenza A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9) polymerase core was generated on basis of the commercial baculovirus expression vector pFastBacDual (Thermo Fisher). The sequence encoding for the complete PB1 protein (SEQ ID NO: 41, synthetic, GenBank: AGJ51960.1) was inserted into the PolH-MCS using the restriction sites BamHI and RsrII; and the sequence encoding for residues 1-127 of the protein PB2 (SEQ ID NO: 42, synthetic, GenBank: KJ633805.1) supplemented with a TEV-cleavable polv-histidine tag (SEP ID NO: 43. GSGSENLYFQGSHHHHHHHH) inserted into the P10-MCS using the restriction sites Bbsl and Xhol. The sequence encoding for residues 201-716 of protein PA (SEQ ID NO: 44, synthetic, GenBank: AGJ51952.1) was cloned first into the vector pACEBac via the restriction sites BamHI and EcoRI, then amplified from this construct including PolH promoter and SV40 polA signal"
