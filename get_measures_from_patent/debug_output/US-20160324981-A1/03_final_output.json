        "raw_mentions": "As depicted in FIG. 4A, anti-CD11a IgGX-AF488 binds in the absence of Fc block, but still retains excellent binding affinity (Kd˜0.5 nM) once the Fc receptors are blocked (FIG. 4B), indicating the binding is CD11a-mediated (FIG. 4A and FIG. 9A).\nThe ADC exhibited strong agonist activity with an EC50=26.7±1.3 nM compared to T0901317 (EC50=79.0±1.1 nM) in THP-1 cells."
