Samples were extracted at different time points and release of parent compound was analyzed by LC-MS. The results indicate the aminooxy-CatB-LXR agonist is completely stable after 24 hours. (FIG. 7A). Cleavage of the Phe-Lys dipeptide was also analyzed by incubating capped compound 10 with purified CatB enzyme (EMD Millipore). Notably, after 2 hours of incubation with CatB, formation of a new peak was observed that corresponds to the mass of the desired cleavage product, compound 3 (FIG. 7B). Taken together, these results indicate the aminooxy-CatB-LXR agonist is stable and can be efficiently released upon enzymatic activation.</p>Example 2Design and Synthesis of Anti-CD11a IgGX-LXR Agonist ADCSynthesis of the corresponding ADC was performed with the linker-derivatized LXR agonist from Example 1. To selectively deliver a LXR agonist to macrophages, CD11a was used as a target antigen. CD11a is the \u03b1-chain component of the lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1). Although CD11a is expressed on most leukocytes, including lymphocytes and granulocytes, expression is abundant on monocytes and macrophages, and importantly, CD11a is not expressed on hepatocytes. Moreover, an increase in the expression of CD11a on monocytes is correlated with atherosclerotic coronary stenosis. CD11a receptors also internalize rapidly, and there are high affinity antibodies readily available (Kd\u02dc2.2 nM) making it an attractive choice for this ADC.</p>In this study, unnatural amino acid (UAA) technology was utilized to incorporate a bio-orthogonal moiety (para-acetylphenylalanine, pAcF) site-specifically into anti-CD11a IgG for reaction with the terminal aminooxy group on our LXR agonist. Accordingly, the variable light and heavy regions of a humanized monoclonal anti-CD11a antibody were cloned into an expression vector containing the orthogonal aaRS/tRNA pair necessary for UAA incorporation in mammalian cells. pAcF was incorporated at position A122 in the constant region of the heavy chain.</p>Table 1 shows the DNA and protein sequences of the anti-CD11a A122pAcF IgG used in this experiment. The heavy chain DNA sequence for anti-CD11a A122pAcF IgG is SEQ ID NO.1 and the light chain DNA sequence for anti-CD11a IgG is SEQ ID NO. 2. The anti-CD11a A122pAcF IgG has a TAG where the UAA was incorporated (bold and underlined). anti-CD11a A122pAcF IgG heavy chain has a variable domain DNA sequence of SEQ ID NO. 3. anti-CD11a A122pAcF IgG has a CH1 domain DNA sequence of SEQ ID NO. 4. anti-CD11a A122pAcF IgG has a hinge DNA sequence of SEQ ID NO. 5. anti-CD11a A122pAcF IgG has a CH2 DNA sequence of SEQ ID NO. 6. anti-CD11a A122pAcF IgG has a CH3 DNA sequence of SEQ ID NO. 7. anti-CD11a A122pAcF IgG light chain has a variable domain DNA sequence of SEQ ID NO. 8. anti-CD11a A122pAcF IgG has a human light chain kappa DNA sequence of SEQ ID NO. 9.</p>Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO",

Anti-CD11a IgGX and negative controls (anti-Her2 IgGX and anti-Her2 FabX) were site-specifically conjugated to aminooxy-Alexa Fluor 488 (AF488, Life Technologies) as described in Example 2. FIG. 15A shows an ESI-MS spectra of anti-CD11a IgGX-AF488. FIG. 15B shows an ESI-MS spectra of anti-Her2 IgGX-AF488. FIG. 15C shows an ESI-MS spectra of anti-Her2 FabX-AF488.</p>To assess the binding affinity of anti-CD11a IgGX and confirm it does not bind hepatocytes, human THP-1 monocyte/macrophage cells and human HepG2 hepatoma cells were incubated with anti-CD11a IgGX-AF488, anti-Her2 IgGX-AF488 and anti-Her2 FabX-AF488 and analyzed the results by flow cytometry. Because monocytes/macrophages have Fc\u03b3 receptors, the binding in the presence of an Fc blocking reagent was also examined (BD biosciences). As depicted in FIG. 4A, anti-CD11a IgGX-AF488 binds in the absence of Fc block, but still retains excellent binding affinity (Kd\u02dc0.5 nM) once the Fc receptors are blocked (FIG. 4B), indicating the binding is CD11a-mediated (FIG. 4A and FIG. 9A). Conversely, anti-Her2 IgGX-AF488 also bound to THP-1 cells in the absence of Fc block (FIG. 4A), but did not bind once the Fc receptors were blocked (FIG. 4B), indicating that the binding of anti-Her2 IgG is Fc-mediated. To further verify this result, a fragment of Her2 (anti-Her2 FabX-AF488), which does not contain the Fc region was also tested. As expected, the anti-Her2 FabX-AF488 did not bind to THP-1 cells (FIG. 4A, FIG. 4B). FIG. 9C shows mean relative fluorescence intensities of the binding of AF488-conjugated antibodies to THP-1 cells in the presence or absence of Fc block. Furthermore, binding of anti-Her2 to THP-1 cells at different concentrations, with or without Fc block treatment was performed (FIG. 9B).</p>FIG. 4D shows binding specificity of anti-CD11a IgGX-AF488 and anti-Her2 IgGX-AF488 on THP-1(+) Fc block cells as shown by a plot of mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) versus concentration of antibody. Furthermore, incubation of anti-CD11a IgGX-AF488 with HepG2 cells did not result in any peak shift by flow cytometry (FIG. 4C), indicating anti-CD11a IgGX binds CD11a selectively and did not have an affinity towards hepatocytes (FIG. 10A, FIG. 10B).</p>Given the high selectivity and affinity of anti-CD11a IgGX, its internalization by THP-1 cells, which is required for successful delivery of the LXR agonist, was examined. Confocal microscopy was used to determine the internalization efficiency of the anti-CD11a antibody into THP-1 cells in the presence or absence of Fc block (FIG. 4E and FIG. 11). As depicted in FIG. 4E, anti-CD11a IgGX-AF488 was observed in the cytoplasm within 2 hours at 37\u00b0 C., which indicates efficient endocytosis. This effect was inhibited at 4\u00b0 C. or in the presence of 20-fold excess of unconjugated anti-CD11a IgGX, which further confirms the internalization is CD11a-mediated. Anti-Her2 IgGX-AF488 was used as a negative control; no internalization was observed.</p>Example 4In Vitro LXR Transactivation AssayNext, the in vitro activity of the anti-CD11a IgGX-CatB-LXR agonist was evaluated using an LXR-driven luciferase stably incorporated into THP-1 and HepG2 cells. This vector encodes the firefly luciferase reporter gene under the control of a CMV promoter and tandem repeats of the LXR-\u03b1 transcriptional response element. Cells were treated with anti-CD11a IgGX-CatB-LXR agonist, T0901317 (2, positive control) or aminooxy-CatB-LXR agonist (10) for 24 hours in the presence or absence of 10% human AB serum to block Fey receptors. Cells were then treated with ONE-Glo and luminescence was read on an Envision plate reader. Notably, LXR activation by the anti-CD11a IgGX-CatB-LXR agonist was selectively induced in THP-1 cells independent of Fc blockade (FIG. 5A). The ADC exhibited strong agonist activity with an EC50=26.7\u00b11.3 nM compared to T0901317 (EC50=79.0\u00b11.1 nM) in THP-1 cells. In HepG2 cells, anti-CD11a IgGX-CatB-LXR agonist did not induce significant activation (FIG. 5B), while T0901317 was equipotent in these cells relative to THP-1. Furthermore, no activity was detected in either cell type treated with compound 10, most likely due to a lack of cell permeability. These results indicate that the anti-CD11a ADC can selectively and effectively deliver a LXR agonist to THP-1 cells.</p>Example 5Chemical SynthesesSee FIGS. 12-14 for chemical structures that correspond to the compound numbers (bold) in the following descriptions.</p>Dipeptide 13.</p>To a solution of H-Lys(Boc)-OMe.HCl 11 (500 mg, 1.68 mmol) and N-Cbz-L-Phenylalanine 12 (605 mg, 2.02 mmol) in DMF (6 mL) was added DIPEA (1.17 mL, 6.72 mmol), HOBt.H<sub>2</sub>O (80%, 645 mg, 3.37 mmol) and EDCI (484 mg, 2.52 mmol).
