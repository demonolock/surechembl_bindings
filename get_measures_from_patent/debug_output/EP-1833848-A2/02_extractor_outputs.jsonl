{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences with specific molecule names, bioactivity metrics, numeric values, and units:\n\n1. Human HVEM-Fc bound with a saturable profile (KD = 112 nM) to human BTLA expressed in 293T cells as detected by flow cytometry (Figure 3A), but failed to bind mouse BTLA over this concentration range.\n2. By contrast, mouse HVEM-Fc bound both human (KD = 27 nM) and mouse BTLA (KD = 24 nM) with similar affinities (Figure 3B) in agreement with species restriction previously observed (Sedy et al., Nat Immunol 6:90 (2005)).\n3. Reciprocally, human BTLA-Fc bound HVEM expressed in 293T cells (KD = 636 nM), but less efficiently than when BTLA was positioned in the membrane (Figure 3C).\n4. Human HVEM-Fc bound human LIGHT expressed in EL4 thyoma cells with a KD = 11 nM.\n5. A soluble form of recombinant human LIGHT (LIGHT-t66) also bound with high affinity to cell-expressed human HVEM (KD = 13 nM) (Figure 3D) yet failed to inhibit binding of BTLA-Fc to HVEM, and as the concentration approached saturation (> 60 nM) LIGHT enhanced BTLA-Fc binding to HVEM (Figure 3E), suggesting the formation of a ternary complex.\n6. A soluble deletion mutant of HSV-I gD (gD) inhibited the binding of BTLA-T to cell-expressed mouse HVEM, yet also blocked binding of HVEM-Fc to membrane LIGHT with similar dose response (KD = -250 nM) (Figure 3G) (see also Mauri et al., Immunity 8:21 (1998)).\n7. The blockade of BTLA binding by 14Cl.1 was highly efficient (EC50=0.2 \u03bcg/ml) when compared to its ability to block mHVEM-Fc binding to LIGHT expressing cells (EC50=5 \u03bcg/ml)."}
