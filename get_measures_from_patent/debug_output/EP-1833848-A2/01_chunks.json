Expression plasmids for BTLA, HVEM, HVEM mutants and ULl 44 variants were transfected into 293T cells and full length human LIGHT was expressed in EL4 cells by retroviral vector transduction (pMIG). BTLA-expressing human dermal fibroblasts (Clonetics Inc., San Diego) were generated by transduction with human or mouse BTLA-expressing retroviral vectors (Sedy et al., Nat Immunol 6:90 (2005)) that were generated by transient transfection of 293T cells (Soneoka et al., Nucleic Acids Res 23:628 (1995), Benedict et al., Immunity 15:617 (2001)). For saturation binding and competition inhibition assays, graded concentrations of recombinant proteins (hHVEM-Fc, mHVEM-Fc, hBTLA-Fc, hLIGHT-t66, gD-Fc, soluble gD, and mouse anti-hLIGHT recombinant \"Omniclone\" antibody (Granger et al., J Immunol 167:5122 (2001)) were diluted in binding buffer (2% FBS in PBS, pH7.4 with 0.02% NaN<sub>3</sub>) and incubated for 60 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Goat anti-human Fc fragment (IgG) specific antibody conjugated with R-Phycoerythrin or goat anti-rabbit Ig antibody was used for detecting the Fc fusion proteins; anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma, St. Louis, USA) was used to detect hLIGHT-t66 and Phycoerythrin- conjugated streptavidin was used to detect biotinylated hHVEM-Fc. Specific mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was obtained by subtracting the background fluorescence staining of the non-transfected cells or isotype matched control antibody (negative control) from the study group. The KD values were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using Prism GraphPad (v4; San Diego, USA) and the molecular mass of the purified protein determined by mass spectrometry.</p>\n  T cell proliferation assays: Human blood was obtained from healthy donors with ethical approval and mononuclear cells were isolated by density gradient centrifugation. Flat-bottomed plates were incubated with varying concentrations of anti-CD3 (clone UCHTl, BD Pharmingen, San Diego, USA) and 5 \u03bcg/ml anti-human \n\nIgGl Fc antibody (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, USA) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Human IgG or various TNFR-Fc proteins were pre-incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 hours with different concentrations. Purified CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells obtained by negative immunomagnetic selection (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, USA) were added at a concentration of 2 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml, in DMEM with 5% heat inactivated human AB serum, antibiotics and 1 \u03bcg/ml soluble anti-CD28 (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, USA) and cultured for 72 hours with 1 \u03bcCi of [<sup>3</sup>H] -thymidine during the last 12 hours.</p>\n  Example 2</p>\n  This example describes data indicating that HVEM is a binding receptor for BTLA on T cells.</p>\n  The proliferation of T cells in response to a suboptimal costimulatory stimulus was examined in T cells isolated from the spleens of mice genetically deficient in HVEM or LIGHT. Single cell suspensions from spleens of C57B1/6 wildtype control mice or HVEM-/- or LIGHT-/- mice were prepared on ice. Red blo",
    "ontrast, mice lacking the gene for LIGHT showed a poor proliferative response to anti-CD3 relative to wild type or HVEM-/- mice. This discordance in phenotype between HVEM and LIGHT deficient T cells suggests that an alternate mechanism suppresses HVEM dependent costimulatory activity effecting cellular proliferation. \n\n The B-T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) is an Ig superfamily member reported to function as an inhibitory protein for T cell activation (Gavrieli et al., Biochem Biophys Res Commun 312:1236 (2003); Watanabe et al., Nat Immunol 4:670 (2003)) and thus a candidate for negatively regulating HVEM.</p>\n  293 T cells were transiently transfected with 5 \u03bcg mouse BTLA-GFP or 5 \u03bcg human BTLA-ires-GFP. Transfection was confirmed by the expression of GFP. Mock, mBTLA, or hBTLA expressing cells (50,000/condition) were added to U- bottom 96 well plates and incubated with varying concentrations of mHVEM:Fc or hHVEM:Fc for 1 hour on ice. Cells were washed twice in cold binding buffer (DPBS, 2% FBS, .02% sodium azide). Binding of Fc fusion proteins was detected using 1 :200 R-Phycoerythrin-conjugated donkey anti-human IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, cat # 709-116-149) followed by washing twice in binding buffer and analyzing for cell-associated fluorescence by flow cytometry.</p>\n  Human 293T cells expressing either mouse or human BTLA bind mouse HVEM-Fc with relatively high affinity as denoted by the concentration of HVEM-Fc required to saturate 50% of the specific binding sites (EC50)(Figure 2A, upper panel). Human HVEM-Fc binds efficiently to human BTLA relative to mouse BTLA (Figure 2A, lower panel).</p>\n  Single cell suspensions from spleens of C57BL/6 wildtype control mice or HVEM-/- mice were directly stained for CD4, CD8, or B220 antibodies (BD</p>\n  Pharmingen) and costained with a mBTLA tetramer reagent. Cells were washed twice with FACS buffer and staining was assessed by flow cytometry. Lymphocyte subsets including CD4, CD8 and B220 positive cells from normal B6 mice bound mouse BTLA tetramer but cells from HVEM-/- mice did not (Figure 2B). This result indicates that HVEM is the only binding receptor for BTLA on these cell populations.</p>\n  Example 3</p>\n  This example describes data indicating that BTLA and LIGHT binding sites on HVEM are spatially distinct.</p>\n  To determine the specificity and molecular topography of the HVEM-BTLA interaction, -Fc fusion proteins were constructed with the ecto domain of HVEM or \n\nBTLA as surrogates of their cell bound receptors (Rooney et al., Meth Enzymol 322:345 (2000)). Dermal fibroblasts (2xlO<sup>4</sup>) stably expressing hBTLA or mBTLA were incubated with graded amounts of human or mouse HVEM-Fc in 50 \u03bcl of binding buffer for 60 minutes, washed and stained with PE conjugated goat anti- human IgG and fluorescence detected by flow cytometry. Human HVEM-Fc bound with a saturable profile (KD = 112 nM) to human BTLA expressed in 293T cells as detected by flow cytometry (Figure 3A), but failed to bind mouse BTLA over this concentration range. By contrast, mouse HVEM-Fc bound both human (KD = 27 nM) and mouse BTLA (KD = 24 nM) with similar affinities (Figure 3B) in agreement with species restriction previously observed (Sedy et al., Nat Immunol 6:90 (2005)). Reciprocally, human BTLA-Fc bound HVEM expressed in 293T cells (KD = 636 nM), but less efficiently than when BTLA was positioned in the membrane (Figure 3C).</p>\n  hi a similar FACS assay, graded concentrations of LIGHT-t66 (FLAG epitope) were incubated with hHVEM expressing HEK293 cells in the presence of 25 \u03bcg/ml of BTLA-Fc and bound ligand detected with goat anti -FLAG-PE. Human HVEM-Fc bound human LIGHT expressed in EL4 thyoma cells with a KD = 11 nM. A soluble form of recombinant human LIGHT (LIGHT-t66) also bound with high affinity to cell-expressed human HVEM (KD = 13 nM) (Figure 3D) yet failed to inhibit binding of BTLA-Fc to HVEM, and as the concentration approached saturation (&gt; 60 nM) LIGHT enhanced BTLA-Fc binding to HVEM (Figure 3E), suggesting the formation of a ternary complex.</p>\n  Competitive binding analysis was performed to determine the topographical relationships of the binding interactions of these ligands with HVEM. HEK293 cells stably transfected with mouse HVEM (293-mHVEM) or EL4 cells transduced with human LIGHT (EL4-hLIGHT) were collected and suspended at 1 XlO<sup>6</sup> cells/ml in binding buffer. For competition studies analyzing BTLA bound to HVEM, increasing concentrations of flag epitope tagged-LIGHT (LIGHTt66; described in (Rooney et al., J Biol Chem 275:14307 (2000)) was preincubated with 2.5xlO<sup>4</sup> 293-HVEM cells in a U-bottom 96-well plate for 30 minutes on ice. Mouse BTLA tetramer reagent (1.4 \u03bcg/ml) was added to the cells for an additional 30 minute incubation on ice. Staining of the mBTLA tetramer was detected by flow cytometry and data are presented as the \n\npercentage of BTLA bound to HVEM expressing cells in the absence LIGHT. For competition studies analyzing HVEM bound to LIGHT, graded concentrations of Flag-LIGHT were preincubated with 2 \u03bcg/ml mHVEM:Fc (2 \u03bcg/ml, detected with goat and human IgG-PE) for 30 minutes on ice. The mixture was then added to EL4- LIGHT cells for an additional 30 minutes incubation on ice in a U-bottom 96-well plate.</p>\n  Binding of mHVEM:Fc to LIGHT expressing cells was detected as described in Example 2 and data are presented as the percentage of HVEM bound to LIGHT expressing cells in the absence of soluble LIGHT. Control for nonspecific staining with mBTLA-T was based on 293T cells.</p>\n  In the mouse system, LIGHT-t66 similarly did not block the binding of mouse HVEM to mouse BTLA-tetramer (BTLA-T)(Figure 3F), although mouse HVEM-Fc binding to membrane-expressed LIGHT was effectively competed. These results indicate that LIGHT and BTLA have substantially different binding affinities and occupy spatially distinct sites on HVEM.</p>\n  A fourth reactant with HVEM, envelope gD from HSV-I can bind both human and mouse HVEM (Montgomery et al., Cell 87:427 (1996), Yoon et al, J Virol 77:9221 (2003)). Graded concentrations of soluble gD (gDt\u039490-99) was used to compete for mBTLA-T (1.4 \u03bcg/ml) binding to mHVEM-HEK293 cells or mHVEM- Fc (2 \u03bcg/ml) to hLIGHT-EL4 cells. With the BTLA site also located in the first CRD, gD may serve as a useful tool to further probe the specific structural requirements for HVEM-BTLA interaction. A soluble deletion mutant of HSV-I gD (gD) inhibited the binding of BTLA-T to cell-expressed mouse HVEM, yet also blocked binding of HVEM-Fc to membrane LIGHT with similar dose response (KD = -250 nM) (Figure 3G) (see also Mauri et al., Immunity 8:21 (1998)). However, previous studies reported that gD did not block the binding of soluble LIGHT or LTa to HVEM-Fc in a plate binding format (Sarrias et al., MoI Immunol 37:665 (2000)). This difference in competitive action of gD with soluble versus transmembrane- anchored LIGHT indicates that the membrane position sterically restricts HVEM binding to LIGHT when gD is present. \n\n Graded concentrations of hBTLA-Fc or mouse anti-LIGHT Omniclone were incubated with hLIGHT expressing EL4 cells in the presence of 6 \u03bcg/ml of biotinylated hHVEM-Fc. The parental EL4 cells were used as negative control. Similarly, BTLA-Fc inhibited the binding of HVEM-Fc to membrane LIGHT in a dose dependent manner (Figure 3H) suggesting that gD is a viral mimic of BTLA. Together, these results indicate that LIGHT and BTLA occupy distinct sites on HVEM, and identifies the BTLA binding site as topographically close to the site occupied by gD in the CRDl.</p>\n  By contrast, recombinant gD was capable of competitively blocking the binding of both BTLA to HVEM-expressing cells and HVEM-Fc binding to LIGHT expressing cells. The effective concentration of gD was similar for both. A monoclonal antibody to mouse HVEM (14C1.1) blocked the binding of BTLA- tetramer to mHVEM expressing cells (Figure 31), whereas another mHVEM binding monoclonal antibody 4CG4 was unable to block binding. The blockade of BTLA binding by 14Cl.1 was highly efficient (EC50=0.2 \u03bcg/ml) when compared to its ability to block mHVEM-Fc binding to LIGHT expressing cells (EC50=5 \u03bcg/ml). This result, together with the ability of gD to block BTLA binding, indicated the BTLA binding site is topographically near the gD binding site on HVEM.</p>\n  Example 4</p>\n  This example describes data studies identifying amino acid residues of BTLA binding site that affect or have little affect on binding to BTLA.</p>\n  Human HVEM point mutants were made using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and were chosen based on their role in gD binding (Connolly et al., J Virol 76:10894 (2002)). hHVEM (in pCDNA) or various point mutants were transiently transfected into 293T cells. Transfected 293T cells were collected and 2x10<sup>5</sup> cells aliquoted per condition of a 96-well V-bottom plate. Cells were stained with 50 \u03bcg/ml polyclonal goat anti-hHVEM or with hBTLA-Fc supernatant for 1 hour on ice. Detection of the Fc fusion protein was as described in Example 2. Detection of HVEM staining was by incubation with 1 : 100 R- phycoerythrin-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, cat # 705- \n\n116-147) followed by washing twice in FACS buffer and analyzing for cell-associated fluorescence by flow cytometry.</p>\n  Point mutations in human HVEM that inhibit the binding of gD and affect infection by HSV-I were constructed to determine if the BTLA, LIGHT and gD binding sites were similar or distinct. The mutations selected in human HVEM included at tyrosine-61 mutated to phenylalanine (Y61F); serine-58 to alanine (S58A) and lysine-6",
    "f VP21-GFP. These results, particularly the K64A mutant distinguishes the BTLA binding site on HVEM from that of gD and LIGHT.</p>\n  Example 5</p>\n  This example describes data indicating that BTLA and gD bind to a distinct, but overlapping site on HVEM.</p>\n  HVEM in complex with gD (UMA) (Carfi et al., Molecular Cell 8:169 (2001)) was viewed using molecular graphics software (Swiss-PDVviewer). Figure 5, left panel, is the ecto domain of HVEM; Figure 5, right panel, is a detailed view of the BTLA binding region. \n\n To address whether BTLA occupies the gD binding site on HVEM, alanine/phenylalanine substitution mutations were introduced into human HVEM in residues within CRDl and 2 (Figure 5A). None of the mutants affected expression of HVEM on the cell surface (Figure 5B) or total protein as detected with a polyclonal anti-HVEM in western blots. Mutations Y61F and K64A in CRDl were particularly informative. The K64A, but not Y61F mutation, abolished binding to BTLA, yet both resulted in a complete loss of gD-Fc binding and virus infectivity as measured by gD expression and viral protein expression (Figure 3B; Connolly et al., J Virol 77:8127 (2003)). These mutants indicate that the BTLA binding site on HVEM is distinct from that of gD.</p>\n  Table 1.

NB, Not bound.</p>\n  6. Glycoprotein D of herpes simplex virus was fused to Fc of rabbit Ig and used in the binding assays at 0.4 \u03bcg/ml. Saturation binding analysis of the HVEM mutants revealed decreased binding affinity of BTLA-Fc to HVEM mutants R62A and E65A (2-3 fold increase in KD) and K64A, but not to several other mutants in CRDl or 2 (Table 1). None of the HVEM mutants affected the affinity of LIGHT466 binding, further indicating that the \n\nmutations were unlikely to have altered the global conformation of HVEM. These results lead to a model in which the gD and BTLA binding sites are located primarily within the CDRl, yet are topographically close, but distinct.</p>\n  Example 6</p>\n  This example describes data indicating that the BTLA binding site is conserved in the cytomegalovirus UL 144.</p>\n  Alignments were performed on sequence of the mature ecto domain. Signal peptide cleavage site to deduce the mature protein was predicted by SignalP. Alignments were made using ClustalW (PAM series) Mac Vector software. Paired cysteines forming disulfide bonds are shown by connecting lines. The amino acid sequence homology of human and mouse HVEM are highly conserved in the region surrounding lysine 64 (Figure 6).</p>\n  Mutational analysis indicated K64 is a major determinant in the ability of HVEM to engage BTLA with additional contributions from R62 and E65. These three residues form a charged ridge on the solvent exposed surface of HVEM that is part of the loop formed by disulfide bonds C57-C75 and C67-C54 in CRDl (Figure 5A). The sequence of CRDl, including the positioning of the cysteines and the equivalent K64 residue, is highly conserved between human and mouse HVEM (62% overall identity in CRDl)(Figure 7). UL144 ORF in human cytomegalovirus showe",
    "rted that UL 144 is a member of the TNFR family that contained only two CRD, exhibiting the closest sequence homology to HVEM and TRAILR2, however UL 144 failed to bind any of the known members of the TNF ligand family including LIGHT, thus had no known function (Benedict et al., J Immunol 162:6967 (1999)). However, the conservation of UL144 with HVEM in this region suggested in this invention that UL144 functions as a BTLA binding protein.</p>\n  Sequence hypervariation exists in the ecto domain of ULl 44 from human CMV isolated from different clinical sources that can be categorized into 5 major groups, IA, IB, 1C, 2 and 3 (Lurain et al., J Virol 73:10040 (1999 Dec)(Figure 7). Expression plasmids encoding representatives of each UL144 group were transfected into 293T cells and the binding of human BTLA-Fc was examined by flow cytometry. \n\nTransfected cells were stained with hBTLA-Fc at 200 \u03bcg/ml or mock transfected control 293T cells. Binding profiles revealed specific interactions between human BTLA-Fc with cells transfected with each of the UL144 variants from human CMV (Figure 8A). Reciprocally, UL144-Fc generated from the Fiala(F) strain of human CMV (a group 3 sequence)(Benedict et al., J Immunol 162:6967 (1999)) specifically bound human, but not mouse BTLA. Graded concentrations of hH VEM-Fc were added to UL144(1C) transfected 293T cells in the presence of hBTLA-Fc (50 \u03bcg/ml). However, human BTLA-Fc bound to cell-expressed UL 144 from each group with similar affinity (KD = 2-4 \u03bcM) despite the sequence variation in CRDl, although binding was weaker than that seen for HVEM (~5 fold). Human HVEM-Fc effectively competed with cell-expressed UL 144(1 C) for binding BTLA-Fc (Figure 8B) indicating they engage a spatially related interaction site on BTLA.</p>\n  Purified CD4+ T cells from human peripheral blood were cultured in 96-well plates at 4 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well and stimulated with graded concentrations of plate-bound anti-CD3 and 1 \u03bcg/ml soluble anti-CD28 in the presence of (10 \u03bcg/ml) human IgG, hLT\u03b2R-Fc, UL144:Fc (Fiala, group 3) or hHVEM:Fc immobilized with anti-human IgGlFc antibody adsorbed to plastic. Graded amounts of hlgG, UL144-Fc(Fiala), or HVEM-Fc were incubated with anti-human IgGlFc antibody adsorbed to plastic. Wells were coated with 10 \u03bcg/ml anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 were used to stimulate purified CD4+ T cells. Cells were cultured for 72 hours, and pulsed with 3H- thymidine in the final 16 hours. The functional similarity of ULl 44 and HVEM was observed in the ability of UL144-Fc to inhibit the proliferation of human CD4+ T cells when activated with limiting amounts of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 in the presence of immobilized fusion proteins. HVEM-Fc and UL 144-Fc, but not LT\u03b2R- Fc, were effective at inhibiting proliferation (Figure 9A), however UL144-Fc was significantly more potent than HVEM-Fc in this assay (Figure 9B). Both HVEM-Fc and UL 144-Fc were most potent in blocking T cell proliferation when immobilized indicating t",
    "rane in which LIGHT resides. The ability of HVEM to activate BTLA signaling when presented in trans from another cell suggests the juxtaposition of HVEM and BTLA in distinct membranes is sufficient for proper orientation (Sedy et al., Nat Immunol 6:90 (2005)), but does not exclude the possibility of an interaction in cis. Because of the noncompetitive interaction of BTLA-Fc and LIGHTt66, both molecules appear to be capable of simultaneously occupying HVEM. Moreover, the binding of soluble LIGHTt66 to HVEM at levels approaching saturation enhanced binding of BTLA-Fc, as indicated by the data described herein, and reported in a paper (Gonzalez et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 102:1116 (2005)) the binding of HVEM-Fc was also enhanced when cells co-expressed LIGHT and BTLA. These results are consistent \n\nwith an ability of the soluble reactants to form a trimolecular complex, and at least theoretically, simultaneously initiate both positive and inhibitory signaling.</p>\n  The evidence for a trimolecular LIGHT-HVEM-BTLA complex was generated with one or more reactants in soluble form, and whether such a complex forms in their normal membrane anchored positions remains to be determined. Three findings suggest that LIGHT will displace BTLA-HVEM interaction, indicating a trimolecular complex is unlikely to form in the normal membrane anchored positions. First, the affinity of the LIGHT-HVEM interaction (binding) is an order of magnitude greater than for the observed HVEM-BTLA complex (KD = 11 nM, HVEM-Fc binding membrane LIGHT; KD = 112 nM, HVEM-Fc binding membrane BTLA). This indicates that the LIGHT-HVEM interaction (binding) will predominate when HVEM is the limiting reactant, which may occur when HVEM is down modulated after T cell activation, concurrent with the induction of LIGHT (Sedy et al., Nat Immunol 6:90 (2005), Mauri et al., Immunity 8:21 (1998), Morel et al., J Immunol 165:4397 (2000)). Second, the viral inhibitor protein gD may influence ligand binding without directly occupying the binding site (non-competitive inhibition). In this regard, glycoprotein D inhibited the interactions of HVEM with BTLA in a competitive fashion supported by the fact their binding sites overlap. However, gD inhibited HVEM binding only when LIGHT was in its membrane anchored position (Fig. IG); soluble LIGHT was not blocked by gD (Sarrias et al., MoI Immunol 37:665 (2000), Sarrias et al., J Virol 73:5681 (1999)). The noncompetitive blockade of HVEM-LIGHT by gD parallels the behavior of BTLA in that BTLA blocks HVEM- Fc binding to membrane anchored LIGHT. These results suggest the possibility that the proximity of the membrane sterically excludes HVEM from binding LIGHT when gD occupies its binding site in the DARC region (noncompetitive behavior). Promoted by high affinity binding, the LIGHT-HVEM complex, may in turn, sterically exclude membrane BTLA from binding HVEM, thus acting in a noncompetitive fashion to disrupt inhibitory signaling by BTLA, which in turn results in inhibiting T cell proliferation an"
