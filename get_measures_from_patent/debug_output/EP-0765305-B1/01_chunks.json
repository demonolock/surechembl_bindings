    "implicated\nType II-14 kDa-PLA<sub>2</sub>'s role in inflammation (Vadas, et al., (1985) Life Sci. 36, 579-587;\nand Seilhamer, et al., (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 5335-5338). Recently, the elevated serum\nlevels of PLA<sub>2</sub> activity during an inflammatory insult has been attributed to cytokine\ninduction of acute phase protein release from liver, of which the 14 kDa-PLA<sub>2</sub> is suggested \nto be a part (Crowl, et al., (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 2647-2651). In addition, soluble PLA<sub>2</sub>\nactivity is markedly elevated in the serum and synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid\narthritis (Stefanski et al., J. Biochem. 100:1297-303 (1986). Furthermore, increasing serum\nPLA<sub>2</sub> levels have been shown to positively correlate with clinical severity (Bomalaski and\nClark, Arthritis and Rheumat. 36:190-198 (1993)). Various inhibitors of PLA<sub>2</sub> have been\ndescribed in publications and in US Patents. See for instance US Patents 4,959,357;\n4,933,365; 5,208,223; 5,208244; Marshall et al., J. Rheumatology 18:1 (1991); Marshall et\nal., Phospholipase A2, Ed. Pyu Wong, Plenum Press, NY (1990) pages 169-181; Wilkerson,\net al., Eur. J. Med. Chem., 26:667, 1991 and Wilkerson, Antiinflammatory Phospholipase\nA<sub>2</sub> Inhibitors, Drugs of the Future, Vol. 15, No. 2, p 139-148(1990). Accordingly, as PLA<sub>2</sub>\nis important in the liberation of arachidoninc acid from phospholipid and may also play a\nrole in the generation of PAF via lysophospholipid formation, inhibition of such an enzyme\nwould be useful for the treatment of disease states caused thereby.</p>There are many novel forms of phospholipase A<sub>2</sub>'s which have recently been\ndiscovered. For the purposes herein, members of the sn-2 acylhydrolase family of PLA<sub>2</sub>'s\nare divided into low and high molecular weight enzymes be it from mammalian, or non-mammalian\nsources. Low molecular weight PLA<sub>2</sub>'s will generally have a molecular weight\nin the range of 12,000 to 15,000. High molecular weight will be in the range of 30,000 or\n56,000 kDa to 110,000 by SDS electrophoresis analysis.</p>A high molecular weight, cytosolic 85 kDa PLA<sub>2</sub> has been isolated and cloned from\nthe human monocytic cell line, U937 (Clark et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 87:7708-7712,\n1990). The cell-associated Type II-14 kDa-PLA<sub>2</sub> in cell lipid metabolism was thought to be\nthe key rate limiting enzyme in lipid mediator formation, until the recent identification of\nthis cell-associated but structurally distinct 85 kDa sn-2 acylhydrolase, (Clark, et al., supra);\nand Kramer, et al., (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 5268-5272. Like the Type II-14 kDa enyzme,\nthis enzyme is active at neutral pH and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, but in contrast exhibits a preference\nfor AA in the sn-2 position of phospholipid substrate and migrates from the cytosol to the\nmembrane in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner and is regulated by phosphorylation (Kramer et al.,\nJ. Biol. Chem., 266:5268-5272 (1991). The 85 kDa-PLA<sub>2</sub> is also distinct from 14 kDa-PLA<sub>2</sub>s\nand Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent PLA<sub>2</sub> as demonstrated by different biochemical\ncharacteristics such as stability of the 85 kDa-PLA<sub>2</sub> to DTT, instability to heat and the lack\nof inhibition by a phosphonate phospholipid TSA inhibitor of 14 kDa-PLA<sub>2</sub>. In addition, 85\nkDa-PLA<sub>2</sub> has been shown to possess a lysophospholipase A<sub>1</sub> activity which is not\nobserved with the 14 kDa-PLA<sub>2</sub>s. The 85 kDa enzyme is similar to the myocardial Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent\nPLA<sub>2</sub> (Hazen and Gross, Circ. Res. 70:486-495 (1992)) in that Ca<sup>2+</sup> is not\nrequired for catalysis and DTNB inhibition is observed. However, 85 kDa-PLA<sub>2</sub> is not\ninhibited by the suicide inactivator bromoenol lactone, suggesting that the enzyme is distinct \nfrom the myocardial enzyme as well. These characteristics make the 85 kDa-PLA<sub>2</sub> a\ncandidate for participation in the liberation of AA from phospholipid stores for subsequent\nmetabolism to lipid mediators. Both the cytosolic 85 kDa PLA<sub>2</sub> and a cell associated Type\nII 14 kDa PLA<sub>2</sub> have been found in the human immune cells such as monocyte, neutrophil\nand platelet (Marshall and Roshak, Biochem. Cell Biol. 71:331-339 (1993)). As noted\nabove most of the cellular lipid mediators found elevated in a variety of inflammatory fluid\nwere formed in response to non-pancreatic PLA<sub>2</sub> action.</p>Since arachidonate-containing phospholipids are the key precursors for a broad range\nof lipid mediators it would not be surprizing that inflammatory cells would treat these\nphospholipids differently than other fatty acid-containing phospholipids. In particular, there\nare enzymes which control the amount of arachidonate in different phospholipid pools and\nthese enzymes are tightly regulated to maintain arachidonate homeostasis. The movement of\narachidonate into and from all phospholipids was originally thought to be exclusively by\nCoenzyme A-dependent acyl transferase activities. Holub et al., Adv. Lipid Res., 16:1-125\n(1978); Lands et al., In The Enzymes of Biological Membranes, ed. Martonosi, A., pp. 3-85,\nPlenum Press, NY, 1976. However, it has now been demonstrated that an enzyme,\nCoenzyme A-independent transcylase (CoA-IT), is involved in the movment of 20 carbon\nhigher unsaturated fatty acids, particularly arachidonate, into particular (1-alkyl- and 1-alkenyl)\nphospholipid pools. These are the phospholipid pools of arachidonate that are\npreferentially mobilized during cell activation and utilized for eicosanoid and PAF\nbiosynsthesis, respectively.</p>CoA-IT has a specificity for certain phospholipids as donor and acceptor molecules.\nThe fatty acid transferred is long chained and unsaturated, and almost exclusively\narachidonate. Other fatty acids such as the 16:0, 18:1 or 18:2 are not moved into the sn-2\nposition of alkyl and 1-alkenyl phospholipid pools by CoA-IT. The specificity of CoA-IT is\nin direct contrast to many other CoA-dependent acylation activities which acylate a wide\nvariety of lysophospholipids with no selectivity for arachidonate.</p>Accordingly, as CoA-IT is involved in arachidonic acid and phospholipid\nmetabolism, inhibition of such an enzyme would be useful for the treatment of\ninflammatory, allergic and hypersecretory conditions or disease states caused thereby.\nTherefore, a method by which CoA-IT is inhibited will consequently and preferentially\ndecrease the arachidonate content of 1-alkyl- and 1-alkenyl-linked phospholipids and will\ntherefore decrease the production of pro-inflammatory mediators such as free arachidonic\nacid, prostaglandins, leukotriene and PAF during an inflammatory response. </p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition of Formula (I) comprising a\ncompound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a\npharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier.</p>The present invention also provides for a pharmaceutical composition comprising a\npharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent and a compound, or a pharmaceutically\nacceptable salt thereof, of Formula (II).</p>This invention also relates to a method of treating or reducing inflammation in a\nmammal in need thereof, which comprises administering to said mammal an effective\namount of a compound or composition of Formula (I) or Formula (II).</p>This invention also relates to a method of treating disease or disorders mediated by\nPLA<sub>2</sub> and/or CoA-IT, free arachidonic acid, its metabolites and/or PAF by administering to\na patient in need thereof an effective amount of a compound of Formula (I) or Formula (II).</p>This invention also relates to a method",

The invention herein is\ntherefore useful to treat such disease states both in humans and in other mammals.</p>Inhibition of CoA-IT and 14 kDa PLA<sub>2</sub> by the compounds of Formula (I) and/or\nFormula (II) is an effective means for simultaneously reducing PAF, free arachidonic acid\nand eicosanoids produced in inflammatory cells. The therapeutic utility of blocking lipid\nmediator generation has been recognized for many years. For example, inhibitors of\ncyclooxygenase, such as aspirin, indomethacin, acetaminophen and ibuprofen, have\ndemonstrated broad therapeutic utilities. CoA-IT inhibitors inhibit cyclooxygenase products.\nAnother class of inhibitors which are used in a broad range of inflammatory disorders are the\ncorticosteroids. Corticosteroids act in a variety of ways, e.g. to induce inflammatory cells to\nproduce proteins which inhibit free arachidonic acid release or to down regulate PLA<sub>2</sub>\nmRNA formation. Both 14 kDa PLA2 inhibitors and CoA-IT inhibitors block the release of\nfree arachidonic acid. Inhibitors of 5-lipoxygenase block the production of leukotrienes and\nleukotriene antagonists prevent the bioactions of leukotrienes. Recent studies indicate that\nboth will have broad therapeutic utilities. Both 14 kDa PLA2 inhibitors and CoA-IT\ninhibitors block the production of leukotrienes. Inhibitors of phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> block the\nrelease of free arachidonic acid and the formation of lyso PAF (the immediate precursor of\nPAF). PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibitors are recognized to have broad therapeutic utilities. It does not,\nhowever, follow that the disease states not",
    "is released during atrial pacing. Intracoronary injection of PAF in pigs\ninduces a prolonged decrease in coronary flow and, in guinea pig hearts, it induces regional\nshunting and ischaemia. In addition PAF has been shown to initiate thrombus formation in a\nmesenteric artery preparation, both when administered exogenously and when released\nendogenously. More recently PAF has been shown to play a role in brain ischaemia induced\nin animal models of stroke. Thus the compounds of the invention, by virtue of their ability\nto antagonise either CoA-IT and/or PLA<sub>2</sub>, thus block the production of PAF, free\narachidonic acid and its metabolites, are likely to be of value in the treatment of any of the\nabove conditions.</p>The action of a PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibitor can be distinguished from the activity of a CoA-IT\ninhibitor based on their specific actions on their respective enzymes and by their different\neffects in cellular assays. For example only CoA-IT inhibitors have the ability to interfere\nwith the mobilization of radiolabelled arachidonic acid to move from the alkyl-PC pool to\nthe alkenyl PE pool. Selective inhibitors of 14 kDa PLA<sub>2</sub> are without an effect in this assay\n(assay E). Alternatively, CoA-IT inhibitors will inhibit both LTC<sub>4</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub> release from\nactivated monocytes while selective PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibitors inhibit LTC4 release but spare\nprostanoid formation or production (assay F).</p>Disease states which could benefit from the inhibition of lipid mediator production\ninclude, but are not limited to, adult respiratory distress syndrome, asthma, arthritis,\nreperfusion injury, endotoxic shock, inflammatory bowel disease, allergic rhinitis and\nvarious inflammatory skin disorders. Each of these disorders is mediated in some part by\nlipid mediators of inflammation. Compounds which inhibit CoA-IT, by virtue of their\nability to block the generation of lipid mediators of inflammation, are of value in the\ntreatment of any of these conditions . Similarly compounds which inhibit PLA<sub>2</sub>, by virtue of\ntheir ability to block the generation of lipid mediators of inflammation stemming from\nactivation and/or release of this enzyme are of value in the treatment of these conditions. In\nparticular, an inhibitor of CoAIT, for instance would offer an advantage over the classical\nNSAIDs which affect only prostanoid production (and not PAF biosynthesis) thereby\ninhibiting both the acute and cell-mediated \"chronic\" inflammatory processes. Further an \nadvantage of the PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibitor would be their affect on human monocyte leukotrienes and\nPAF formation, while immunosuppressive prostanoids, such as PGE<sub>2</sub>, are spared.</p>Treatment of disease states caused by these lipid inflammatory mediators i.e.,\narachidonate, eicosanoids and PAF, include certain cardiovascular disorders such as but not\nlimited to, myocardial infarction, stroke, circulatory shock, or hypotension, ischemia,\nreperfusion injury, inf",
    "e used to determine in vitro activity. Additionally, various classical in vivo\nacute inflammatory models which have some aspect of their etilogy to elevated eicosanoid\nlevels can be employed, such as the paw edema model, mouse zymosan peritonitis, reverse\nArthus pleurisy or various skin inflammation assays which are described in Lewis et al.,\nExperimental Models of Inflammation, in the Handbook of Inflammation, Vol. 5, Bonta Ed.,\nElsevier Science Publishers, NY (1985) whose disclosure is herein incorporated by \nreference. The TPA induced ear edema model (mouse) as well as the carrageenan paw\nedema model in the rat are described herein as well. These classical models of\ninflammation will reflect the drug's ability to alter an inflammatory response but cannot\naddress the specificity of drug action. These models have been traditionally designed as non\nsteriod antiinflammatory drug sensitive pharmacological screens and it is important to utilize\nmodels which can differentiate PLA2 and CoA-IT inhibitors from NSAIDS.</p>Cell-free and Cellular Assessment of InhibitorsDescribed herein are several in vitro assays both for CoA-IT and PLA<sub>2</sub> enzyme activities.\nThe first employes purified recombinant enzyme or a broken cell assay, assay (a or b,\nrespectively) described below. Alternatively, evaluation of inhibitors can occur in intact\ncells such as described in the assay, assay (c and d) below. CoA-IT activity can exclusively\nbe measured, and differentiated from PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibition, in intact cells by following the\nmovement of a pulse of [<sup>3</sup>H] arachidonate as it moves into the 1-alkyl and 1-alkenyl\nphospholipids in inflammatory cells (assay e). It should be noted for the purposes herein that\nassays c, d, &amp; f can both be used for PLA<sub>2</sub> and CoA-IT inhibition determination.</p>Inflammatory Responses in vivoThe ability of compounds that inhibit CoA-IT and/or PLA<sub>2</sub> to affect in vivo\ninflammatory responses may be assessed. Inflammatory responses are induced in the mouse\near by the topical application of a pro-inflammatory agent, such as 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol\n13-acetate (assay g). This produces an edematous response, as\nmeasured by increases in ear thickness, as well as increased inflammatory cellular infiltrate,\nas measured by increases in myeloperoxidase activity (as described in the methods). To\nfurther validate the mechanism of action inflammation induced by the direct administration\nof arachidonic acid can be used. In this case, compounds altering arachidonic acid\nmobilization or liberation should be without effect.</p>In Vitro AssaysAssay (a): Phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> assay:Phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> activity of rh Type II - 14 KDaPLA<sub>2</sub> or PLA<sub>2</sub> semi-purified from\nhuman Synovial joint fluid was measured by the acylhydrolysis of high specific activity\n(NEN)[<sup>3</sup>H]-AA-E. coli (0.5 mCi/5nmol PL Pi) as previously described in Marshall et al.,\nJ. Rheumatology, 18:1, pp59-65 (1991). High specific activity [<sup>3</sup>H]AA-E. coli had up to\n95% of the label incorporated into phospholipid which was localized almost exclusively in\nthe sn-2 position, as demonstrated by purified 14kDa PLA2 or low molecular weight PLA<sub>2</sub> \nacyl hydrolysis and separation of products by thin la",
    "in was rh Type II 14 kDa PLA2, or alternatively bovine\npancreatic PLA<sub>2</sub> was also be used]. The reaction mixture (50 or 100 ml total volume)\ncontained 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCI, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and [<sup>3</sup>H]-AA-E. coli (low\nspecific activity; 5-8 nmol PL Pi per assay). Assays were incubated for a time predetermined\nto be on the linear portion of a time versus hydrolysis plot (10 min). Experiments were\nconducted with final % hydrolysis values ranging from 2% (400-1000 dpm) to 10% (2000-5000\ndpm) acylhydrolysis after blank correction. Reactions were terminated by the addition\nof 1.0 mL tetrahydrofuran (THF). The whole sample was placed over aminopropyl solid\nphase silica columns and eluted with THF:acetic acid (49:1) exclusively separating free fatty\nacids with greater than 95% recovery. Radiolabel in this eluate was quantitated by liquid\nscintillation counting. Results were expressed as % of fatty acid hydrolyzed ([sample dpms -\nnon-specific (blank) dpms/total dpms] x 100) or specific activity which was calculated from\nhydrolysis values found in the linear portion of time versus % hydrolysis plots (pmol free\nfatty acid hydrolyzed/mg/min). Non-specific activity was always less than 1% of the total\ncounts added.</p>Protein determinationAll protein concentrations were determined by Bradford protein analysis kits (Biorad,\nRichmond, CA).</p>Results:The following representative compounds of Formula (I) and (II) below demonstrated\npositive PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibition in the above noted method.

The cells were incubated with gentle shaking at 37\u00b0C for 5 min. The reaction\nwas terminated by the addition of 40 ml ice-cold HBSS containing HSA (0.25 mg/ml). The\ncells were then removed from the supernatant fluid by centrifugation (225 g, 8 min).\nUnincorporated [<sup>3</sup>H]-arachidonic acid was completely removed by two more washes of\nHBSS containing 0.25 mg/ml HSA. The neutrophils were resuspended in fresh buffer,\nexposed to various concentrations of a CoA-IT inhibitor or its vehicle and incubated without\nstimulation for 2 hrs. At that time, the tubes containing the cells and buffer were extracted \n(Bligh &amp; Dyer [Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. (1959) 37, 911-917]) and t"
