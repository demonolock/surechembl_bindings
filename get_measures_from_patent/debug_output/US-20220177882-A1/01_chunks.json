    "hy human proteome.</p>Cancer antigens also include tumour-associated antigens, which are antigens whose expression or production is associated with (but not limited to) tumour cells. Examples of tumour-associated antigens include for instance Her2, prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), carcino embryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen-125 (CA-125), CA19-9, calretinin, MUC-1, epithelial membrane protein (EMA), epithelial tumor antigen (ETA), tyrosinase, melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE), CD34, CD45, CD99, CD117, chromogranin, cytokeratin, desmin, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), gross cystic disease fluid protein (GCDFP-15), HMB-45 antigen, protein melan-A (melanoma antigen recognized by T lymphocytes; MART-1), myo-D1, muscle-specific actin (MSA), neurofilament, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), placental alkaline phosphatase, synaptophysis, thyroglobulin, thyroid transcription factor-1, the dimeric form of the pyruvate kinase isoenzyme type M2 (tumor M2-PK), CD 19, CD22, CD27, CD30, CD70, GD2 (ganglioside G2), EGFRvIII (epidermal growth factor variant III), sperm protein 17 (Spl7), mesothelin, PAP (prostatic acid phosphatase), prostein, TARP (T cell receptor gamma alternate reading frame protein), Trp-p8, STEAP1 (six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 1), an abnormal ras protein, or an abnormal p53 protein. In another specific embodiment, said tumor-associated antigen or tumor-specific antigen is integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 (CD61), galactin, K-Ras (V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene), or Ral-B.</p>In certain embodiments, the immune cell may be directed against a surface protein selected from CD1a, CD1b, CD1c, CD1d, CD1e, CD2, CD3, CD3d, CD3e, CD3g, CD4, CD5, CD6, CD7, CD8a, CD8b, CD9, CD10, CD11a, CD11b, CD11c, CD11d, CDw12, CD13, CD14, CD15, CD15u, CD15s, CD15su, CD16, CD16b, CD17, CD18, CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD23, CD24, CD25, CD26, CD27, CD28, CD29, CD30, CD31, CD32, CD33, CD34, CD35, CD36, CD37, CD38, CD39, CD40, CD41, CD42a, CD42b, CD42c, CD42d, CD43, CD44, CD45, CD45RA, CD45RB, CD45RC, CD45RO, CD46, CD47, CD48, CD49a, CD49b, CD49c, CD49d, CD49e, CD49f, CD50, CD51, CD52, CD53, CD54, CD55, CD56, CD57, CD58, CD59, CD60a, CD60b, CD60c, CD61, CD62E, CD62L, CD62P, CD63, CD64, CD65, CD65s, CD66a, CD66b, CD66c, CD66d, CD66e, CD66f, CD68, CD69, CD70, CD71, CD72, CD73, CD74, CD75, CD75s, CD77, CD79a, CD79b, CD80, CD81, CD82, CD83, CD84, CD85a, CD85d, CD85j, CD85k, CD86, CD87, CD88, CD89, CD90, CD91, CD92, CD93, CD94, CD95, CD96, CD97, CD98, CD99, CD99R, CD100, CD101, CD102, CD103, CD104, CD105, CD106, CD107a, CD107b, CD108, CD109, CD110, CD111, CD112, CD113, CD114, CD115, CD116, CD117, CD118, CD119, CD120a, CD120b, CD121a, CD121b, CD122, CD123, CD124, CD125, CD126, CD127, CD129, CD130, CD131, CD132, CD133, CD134, CD135, CD136, CD137, CD138, CD139, CD140a, CD140b, CD141, CD142, CD143, CD144, CDw145, CD146, CD147, CD148, CDw149, CD150, CD151, CD152, CD153, CD154, CD155, CD156a, CD156b, CD156c, CD157, CD158e, CD158i, "
