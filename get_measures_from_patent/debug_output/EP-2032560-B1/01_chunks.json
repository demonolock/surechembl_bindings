    "t 100 x g for 20 minutes at 4\u00b0 C to remove red cells. The supernatants were decanted and centrifuged at 3000 x g for 15 minutes to pellet platelets. Platelets were re-suspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, to a total volume of 200 ml and centrifuged at 4400 x g for 10 minutes. This step was repeated two additional times. Platelets were re-suspended in 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA to a final volume of approximately 30 ml and were homogenized with 20 strokes in a Dounce\u2122 homogenizer. Membranes were pelleted at 41,000 x g, re-suspended in 40-50 ml 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, and 10 ml aliquots were frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub> and stored at -80\u00b0 C. To complete membrane preparation, aliquots were thawed, pooled, and homogenized with 5 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. Membranes were pelleted and washed 3 times in 10 mM triethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM EDTA, and re-suspended in 20-25 ml 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA, and 1% DMSO. Aliquots of membranes were frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub> and stored at -80\u00b0 C. Membranes were stable for at least 3 months. 20 units of platelet concentrates typically yielded 250 mg of membrane protein. Protein concentration was determined by a Lowry assay (Lowry et al., J. Biol. Chem., 193:265-275 (1951)).</p>High Throughput Thrombin Receptor Radioligand Binding AssayThrombin receptor antagonists were screened using a modification of the thrombin receptor radioligand binding assay of Ahn et al. (Ahn et al., Mol. Pharmacol., 51:350-356 (1997)). The assay was performed in 96 well Nunc plates (Cat. No. 269620) at a final assay volume of 200 \u00b5l. Platelet membranes and [<sup>3</sup>H]haTRAP were diluted to 0.4 mg/ml and 22.2 nM, respectively, in binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1% BSA). Stock solutions (10 mM in 100% DMSO) of test compounds were further diluted in 100% DMSO. Unless otherwise indicated. 10 \u00b5l of diluted compound solutions and 90 \u00b5l of radioligand (a final concentration of 10 nM in 5% DMSO) were added to each well, and the reaction was started by the addition of 100 \u00b5l of membranes (40 \u00b5g protein/well). The binding was not significantly inhibited by 5% DMSO. Compounds were tested at three concentrations (0.1, 1 and 10 10\u00b5M). The plates were covered and vortex-mixed gently on a Lab-Line\u2122 Titer Plate Shaker for 1 hour at room temperature. Packard UniFilter\u2122 GF/C filter plates were soaked for at least 1 hour in 0.1% polyethyleneimine. The incubated membranes were harvested using a Packard FilterMate\u2122 Universal Harvester and were rapidly washed four times with 300 \u00b5l ice cold 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA. MicroScint\u2122 20 scintillation cocktail (25 \u00b5l) was added to each well, and the plates were counted in a Packard TopCount\u2122 Microplate Scintillation Counter. The specific binding was defined as the total binding minus the nonspecific binding observed in the presence of excess (50 \u00b5M) unlabeled haTRAP. The % inhibition by a compound of [<sup>3</sup>H]haTRAP binding to thrombin receptors was calculated from the following relationship: %Inhibition=Total binding-Binding in the presence of a test compoundTotal binding-Nonspecific bindingx100<img id=\"ib0021\" path=\"imgb0021.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/231046055/EP/20130501/B1/000002/03/25/60/imgb0021.tif\"/></p>MaterialsA(pF-F)R(ChA)(hR)Y-NH<sub>2</sub> and A(pF-F)R(ChA)(hR)(I<sub>2</sub>-Y)-NH<sub>2</sub>. were custom synthesized by AnaSpec Inc. (San Jose, CA). The purity of these peptides was &gt;95%. Tritium gas (97%) was purchased from EG&amp;G Mound, Miamisburg, Ohio. The gas was subsequently loaded and stored on an IN/US Systems Inc. Trisorber. MicroSeint\u2122 20 scintillation cocktail was obtained from Packard Instrument Co.</p>Cannabinoid CB<sub>2</sub>Receptor Binding AssayBinding to the human cannabinoid CB<sub>2</sub> receptor was carried out using the procedure of Showalter, et al. (1996, J. Pharmacol Exp Ther. 278(3), 989-99), with minor modifications. All assays were carried out in a final volume of 100 ul. Test compounds were re-suspended to 10 mM in DMSO, then serially diluted in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.1, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EDTA, 50% DMSO. Aliquots (10 ul) of each diluted sample were then transferred into individual wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. Membranes from human CB<sub>2</sub> transfected CHO/Ki cells (Receptor Biology, Inc) were re-suspended in binding buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.1. 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 % fatty acid free bovine serum albumin), then added to the binding reaction (-15 ug in 50 ul per assay). The reactions were initiated with the addition of [<sup>3</sup>H] CP-55, 940 diluted in binding buffer (specific activity = 180 Ci/mmol; New England Nuclear, Boston, Mass.). The final ligand concentration in the binding reaction was 0.48 nM. Following incubation at room temperature for 2 hours, membranes were harvested by filtration through pretreated (0.5% polyethylenimine; Sigma P-3143) GF-C filter plates (Unifilter-96, Packard) using a TomTec\u2122 Mach 3U 96-well cell harvester (Hamden, Ct). Plates were washed 10 times in 100 \u00b5l binding buffer, and the membranes hallowed to air dry. Radioactivity on membranes was quantitated following addition of Packard Omniscint\u2122 20 scintillation fluid using a TopCount\u2122 NXT Microplate Scintillation and Luminescence Counter (Packard, Meriden, Ct). Non-linear regression analysis was performed using Prism\u2122 20b. (GraphPad Software, San Diego, Ca).</p>Using the test procedures described above, representative compounds of formula I were found to have thrombin receptor K<sub>i</sub> values ranging from about 3 nM to about 20 nM and thrombin receptor IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from about 5 nM to about 70 nM as shown in Table I below.\nTable I:Compound No.StructureK<sub>i</sub>IC<sub>50</sub>1<img id=\"ib0022\" path=\"imgb0022.tif\" "
