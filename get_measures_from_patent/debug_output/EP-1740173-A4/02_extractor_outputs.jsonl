{"raw_mentions": "Compounds of formula I' tested in this assay exhibited IC50 values of less than 200\u03bcM indicating LAP inhibitory activity.\nThe resulting values were plotted as a function of antagonist concentration and fit to a 4-parameter equation using Kaleidograph software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Indications of antagonist potency were determined from the IC50 values.\nFluorescence polarization values were plotted as a function of the antagonist concentration, and the IC50 values were obtained by fitting the data to a 4-\u03c1arameter equation using Kaleidograph software (Synergy software, Reading, PA)."}
