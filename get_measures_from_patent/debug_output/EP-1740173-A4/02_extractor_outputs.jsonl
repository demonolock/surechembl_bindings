{"raw_mentions": "Compounds of formula I' tested in this assay exhibited IC50 values of less than 200\u03bcM indicating LAP inhibitory activity.\nThe resulting values were plotted as a function of antagonist concentration and fit to a 4-parameter equation using Kaleidograph software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Indications of antagonist potency were determined from the IC50 values.\nFluorescence polarization values were plotted as a function of the antagonist concentration, and the IC50 values were obtained by fitting the data to a 4-\u03c1arameter equation using Kaleidograph software (Synergy software, Reading, PA). \nA reagent cocktail containing 300 nM his-tagged MLXBLR3SG; 200 nM biotinylated SMAC peptide (AVPL); 5 \u03bcg/mL anti-his allophycocyanin (XL665) (CISBio International); and 200 ng/mL streptavidin-europium (Perkin Elmer) was prepared in reagent buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.2], 120 mM NaCl, 0.1% bovine globulins, 5mM DTT and 0.05% octylglucoside). \nSamples for fluorescence polarization affinity measurements were prepared by addition of 1:2 serial dilutions starting at a final concentration of 5\u03bcM of MLXBLR3SG in polarization buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.2], 120 mM NaCl, 1% bovine globulins 5mM DTT and 0.05% octylglucoside) to 5-carboxyflourescein- conjugated AVPdi-Phe-NH2 (AVP-diPhe-FAM) at 5 nM final concentration.\nCompetition experiments were performed by addition of the MLXBLR3SG at 30 nM to wells containing 5 nM of the AVP-diPhe- FAM probe as well as 1:3 serial dilutions of antagonist compounds starting at a concentration of 300 \u03bcM in the polarization buffer."}
