    "thesized as largely inactive zymogens that require proteolytic processing in order to be active. This proteolytic processing is only one of the ways in which caspases are regulated. The second mechanism is through a family of proteins that bind and inhibit caspases. \n\nA family of molecules that inhibit caspases are the Inhibitors of Apoptosis (IAP) (Deveraux et al., J Clin Immunol (1999), 19:388-398). IAPs were originally discovered in baculovirus by their functional ability to substitute for P35 protein, an anti-apoptotic gene (Crook et al. (1993) J Virology 67, 2168-2174). IAPs have been described in organisms ranging from Drosophila to human. Regardless of their origin, structurally, IAPs comprise one to three Baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) domains, and most of them also possess a carboxyl-terminal RING finger motif. The BIR domain itself is a zinc binding domain of about 70 residues comprising 4 alpha-helices and 3 beta strands, with cysteine and histidine residues that coordinate the zinc ion (Hinds et al., (1999) Nat. Struct. Biol. 6, 648-651). It is the BIR domain that is believed to cause the anti-apoptotic effect by inhibiting the caspases and thus inhibiting apoptosis. As an example, human X-chromosome linked IAP (XIAP) inhibits caspase 3, caspase 7 and the Apaf-1-cytochrome C mediated activation of caspase 9 (Deveraux et al., (1998) EMBO J. 17, 2215-2223). Caspases 3 and 7 are inhibited by the BIR2 domain of XIAP, while the BIR3 domain of XIAP is responsible for the inhibition of caspase 9 activity. XIAP is expressed ubiquitously in most adult and fetal tissues (Liston et al, Nature, 1996, 379(6563):349), and is overexpressed in a number of tumor cell lines of the NCI 60 cell line panel (Fong et al, Genomics, 2000, 70:113; Tamm et al, Clin. Cancer Res. 2000, 6(5): 1796). Overexpression of XIAP in tumor cells has been demonstrated to confer protection against a variety of pro-apoptotic stimuli and promotes resistance to chemotherapy (LaCasse et al, Oncogene, 1998, 17(25):3247). Consistent with this, a strong correlation between XIAP protein levels and survival has been demonstrated for patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (Tamm et al, supra). Down-regulation of XIAP expression by antisense oligonucleotides has been shown to sensitize tumor cells to death induced by a wide range of pro-apoptotic agents, both in vitro and in vivo (Sasaki et al, Cancer Res., 2000, 60(20):5659; Lin et al, Biochem J., 2001, 353:299; Hu et al, Clin. Cancer Res., 2003, 9(7):2826). Smac/DIABLO-derived peptides have also been demonstrated to sensitize a number of different tumor cell lines to apoptosis induced by a variety of pro-apoptotic drugs (Arnt et al, J. Biol. Chem., 2002, 277(46) :44236; Fulda et al, Nature Med., 2002, 8(8):808; Guo et al, Blood,2002, 99(9):3419; Vucic et al, J. Biol. Chem.,2002, 277(14): 12275; Yang et al, Cancer Res., 2003, 63(4):831).</p>\n  Melanoma IAP (ML-IAP) is an LAP not detectable in most normal adult tissues but is strongly upregulated in melanoma (Vucic et al., (2000) Current Bio 10:1359-1366). Determination of protein structure demonstrated significant homology of the ML-IAP BIR and RING finger domains to corresponding domains present in human XIAP, C-IAPl and C-IAP2. The BIR domain of ML- LAP appears to have the most similarities to the BIR2 and BIR3 of XIAP, C-LAPl and C-IAP2, and appears to be responsible for the inhibition of apoptosis, as determined by deletional analysis. \n\nFurthermore, Vucic et al., demonstrated that ML-IAP could inhibit chemotherapeutic agent induced apoptosis. Agents such as adriamycin and 4-tertiary butylphenol (4-TBP) were tested in a cell culture system of melanomas overexpressing ML-IAP and the chemotherapeutic agents were significantly less effective in killing the cells when compared to a normal melanocyte control. The mechanism by which ML-IAP produces an anti-apoptotic activity is through inhibition of caspase 3, 7 and 9. ML-IAP did not effectively inhibit caspases 1, 2, 6, or 8.</p>\n  Since apoptosis is a strictly controlled pathway with multiple interacting factors, the discovery that LAPs themselves are regulated was not unusual. Ln the fruit fly Drosophila, the Reaper (rpr), Head Involution Defective (hid) and GRLM proteins physically interact with and inhibit the anti- apoptotic activity of the Drosophila family of IAPs. In the mammal, the proteins SMAC/DIABLO act to block the LAPs and allow apoptosis to proceed. It was shown that during no\u03c0nal apoptosis, SMAC is processed into an active form and is released from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm where it physically binds to IAPs and prevents the LAP from binding to a caspase. This inhibition of the LAP allows the caspase to remain active and thus proceed with apoptosis. hiterestingly, sequence homology between the LAP inhibitors shows that there is a four amino acid motif in the N-terminus of the processed, active proteins. This tetrapeptide appears to bind into a hydrophobic pocket in the BLR domain and disrupts the BLR domain binding to caspases (Chai et al., (2000) Nature 406:855-862, Liu et al., (2000) Nature 408:1004-1008, Wu et al., (2000) Nature 408 1008- 1012).</p>\n  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</p>\n  In one aspect of the present invention there is provided novel inhibitors LAP having the general formula (I)</p>\n  \n    \n  </p>\n  wherein</p>\n  Xi and X<sub>2</sub> are independently O or S; \n\nL is a bond, -C(X<sub>3</sub>)-, -C(X<sub>3</sub>)NR,<sub>2</sub> or -C(X<sub>3</sub>)O- wherein X<sub>3</sub> is O or S and R<sub>12</sub> is H or R^</p>\n  Ri is alkyl, a carbocycle, carbocycle-substituted alkyl, a heterocycle or heterocycle-substituted alkyl, wherein each is optionally substituted with halogen, hydroxyl, mercapto, carboxyl, alkyl, haloalkyl, alkoxy, alkylsulfonyl, amino, nitro, aryl and heteroaryl; R<sub>2</sub> is alkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, aryl, aralkyl, a heterocycle or heterocyclylalkyl; R<sub>3</sub> is H or alkyl; R<sub>4</sub> and R^ are independently H, alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, heteroaryl, or heteroaralkyl wherein each is optionally substituted with halogen, hydroxyl, mercapto, carboxyl, alkyl, alkoxy",

A reagent cocktail containing 300 nM his-tagged MLXBLR3SG; 200 nM biotinylated SMAC peptide (AVPL); 5 \u03bcg/mL anti-his allophycocyanin (XL665) (CISBio International); and 200 ng/mL streptavidin-europium (Perkin Elmer) was prepared in reagent buffer (50 mM Tris [pH \n\n 7.2], 120 mM NaCl, 0.1% bovine globulins, 5mM DTT and 0.05% octylglucoside). (Alternatively, this cocktail can be made using europium-labeled anti-His (Perkin Elmer) and streptavidin- allophycocyanin (Perkin Elmer) at concentrations of 6.5 nM and 25nM, respectively). The reagent cocktail was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. After incubation, the cocktail was added to 1:3 serial dilutions of an antagonist compound (starting concentration of 50 \u03bcM) in 384- well black FLA plates (Greiner Bio-One, Inc.). After a 90 minute incubation at room temperature, the fluorescence was read with filters for the excitation of europium (340 nm) and for the emission wavelengths of europium (615 nm) and a allophycocyanin (665 nm). Antagonist data were calculated as a ratio of the emission signal of allophycocyanin at 665 nm to that of the emission of europium at 615 nm (these ratios were multiplied by a factor of 10,000 for ease of data manipulation). The resulting values were plotted as a function of antagonist concentration and fit to a 4-parameter equation using Kaleidograph software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA).
