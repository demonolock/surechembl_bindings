    "CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This patent application is a continuation-in-part and claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/337,100 filed Dec. 4, 2001, the entirety of the disclosure of which is incorporated into the present application by reference.</p>FIELD OF THE INVENTION Urokinase is an enzyme involved in the metastasis of tumor cells, neovascularization, and other activities. One aspect of the present invention is to provide novel compounds that can be used to inhibit the activity of urokinase and thereby attenuate its deleterious effects. Another aspect of the present invention is to provide novel compounds which inhibit blood vessel formation, particularly blood vessel formation related to a pathologic condition.</p>BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION TO THE INVENTION Urinary-type plasminogen activator (uPA; urokinase) is a serine protease within the trypsin/chymotrypsin family. In its physiological state, uPA is found in three forms: single chain pro-uPA, two chain uPA, and low molecular weight uPA (lacks N-terminal domains). The zymogen, pro-uPA, is converted to u-PA by cleavage of the peptide bond at K158-I159. The resultant two chain uPA is linked by disulfide bridges, has an M<sub>r </sub>of about 50 kD, and a C-terminal serine proteinase domain.</p>The activity of uPA is focused to cell surfaces upon binding to its receptor, uPAR. uPAR is a single-chain glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-anchored membrane receptor. The N-terminal 92 amino acids of uPAR play a dominant role in binding to uPA and pro-uPA. Receptor for uPA has been located on T-cells, NK cells, monocytes, and neutrophils, as well as vascular endothelial cells, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, keratinocytes, placental trophoblasts, hepatocytes, and a wide variety of tumor cells.</p>After conversion of pro-uPA to uPA, which occurs primarily at the uPAR on the cell surface, uPA activates plasminogen to plasmin. Activation occurs upon cleavage at residues PGR-VV for human plasminogen, or at residues SGR-IV for bovine plasminogen. Because plasminogen also is present on the cell surface, this activation cascade focuses the activity of uPA and plasmin on the plasma membrane. Plasmin has many roles, including activation of additional uPA and other enzymes, digestion of fibrin, and digestion of components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Digestion of the ECM surrounding a tumor removes the ECM as a physical barrier to metastasizing cells, which are then free to leave primary tumors and invade secondary sites. A review of the role of the uPA/uPAR system in cancer metastasis is provided in \u201cThe Urokinase-type Plasminogen Activator System in Cancer Metastasis: A Review\u201d, Andreasen et al., Int. J.
