    "rly preferred embodiment, the target cell is an immune cell. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the target cells are Treg cells. In one embodiment, the immune cells expressing TNFR2 are selected from T regulatory cells (tregs), B regulatory cells (bregs), and MDSCs (myeloid-derived suppressor cells). In one embodiment, the target cell may be a Treg cell, which is a foxp3+cd25+ regulatory T cell. </p>Binding molecules</p>The present invention provides binding molecules that bind TNFR2. In a preferred embodiment, the binding molecules of the invention will bind to TNFR2 and stimulate signaling through TNFR2. In a preferred embodiment, the binding molecule is an agonistic antibody or antibody fusion protein or antibody fragment fusion protein directed against TNFR2, and thereby activates the receptor. In a preferred embodiment, the binding molecules are antibodies that specifically bind to TNFR2, preferably they are antibodies that specifically bind to TNFR2 and act as agonists thereof and do not bind FcgR. In a preferred embodiment, the binding molecules of the invention bind to TNFR2 to a greater extent than to TNFR1. For example, the binding strength for TNFR2 can be at least 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, or more times higher than TNFR1. In one embodiment, the binding strength of TNFR2 can be at least 10,000 times or at least 100,000 times higher as compared to TNFR1. In one embodiment, the binding molecule does not bind TNFR1 at all. In a preferred embodiment, when the bound KD has a value of less than 10 <sup>-6</sup> M\u300110 <sup>-7</sup> M\u300110 <sup>-8</sup> M\u300110 <sup>-9</sup> M or 10- <sup>10</sup> At the value of M, the binding molecules of the invention, particularly antibodies or antibody fragments or fusion proteins thereof, are said to specifically bind TNFR2. In one embodiment, the KD values are measured using cells expressing TNFR2, such as HeLa transfectants expressing TNFR2. In a preferred embodiment, KD values are determined using Kums J, nelke J, B,V, siegmuld D, wajant H.MAbs.2017Apr;9 (3) determination by the method set forth in 506-520. Thus, in one embodiment, a fusion of the binding molecule with Gaussia princps luciferase as a reporter domain is used to measure the KD value of the binding molecule as described in Kums et al. In one embodiment, TNFR 2-expressing cell lines can be usedSuch measurements are, for example, heLa or HEK293 cells stably expressing TNFR2 on their surfaces. Typically, the binding molecules of the invention bind to TNFR2 and trigger TNFR2 signaling. In one embodiment, the provided binding molecules, particularly antibodies, are agonistic to TNFR2, but not to TNFR 1. In one embodiment, the binding molecules of the invention bind to TNFR2, but not to any other TNFR superfamily members.</p>In a particularly preferred embodiment, the binding molecules of the invention are antibodies. The term \"antibody\" as used herein generally refers to any functional antibody or antibody fusion protein or antibody fragment capable of specifically binding to an antigen of interest, such as Paul, W.E. (Ed.): fundamental Immunology 2nd Ed.Raven Press,Ltd, new York 1989, summarized in chapter 7, incorporated herein by reference or shown in \"Periodic Table of Antibodies\" (https:// antibodies. Unless otherwise specified, the antibodies referred to herein comprise antibody fragments. The antibodies of the invention typically specifically bind to TNFR2. Reference to an antibody encompasses all of the different antibody forms discussed herein, including antibodies that do not have the naturally occurring four-chain structure of antibodies found in humans, e.g., in a preferred embodiment, an antibody of the invention may be or may include a s",
    "ptide linker which is too short to allow pairing between two domains on the same chain. This results in pairing with the complementary domain of the other strand and assembling a dimer molecule with two TNFR2 antigen binding sites.</p>There are a variety of antibody formats and can be used as an antibody of the invention or a part thereof, for example Fab, fv, scFv, (ScFv) 2, (ScFv 2), bispecific (ScFv 2), diabodies, tetrabodies, bispecific sc (Fv) 2, tandem diavs, tandem triavs and trisomy all represent possible antibody formats of the invention. As discussed above, the binding molecules of the invention have at least a bivalent character. In a preferred embodiment, the binding molecules of the invention have a valency of at least two sterically mobile, potential cell-cell linked TNFR2 binding sites or at least six \"parallel\" or \"unidirectionally\" oriented cis-acting binding sites. In embodiments where the formats mentioned herein have a monovalent character, they may be used in such formats as part of the antibodies of the invention, rather than as whole antibodies. </p>In one embodiment, the binding molecules of the invention may include variant binding sites for TNFR2, rather than one of the TNFR2 specific binding sites listed herein. In a preferred embodiment, a variant binding molecule of TNFR2 will be defined by its ability to cross-block binding of one of the TNFR 2-specific binding molecules listed herein to TNFR 2. The ability to cross-block can be assessed using a binding assay for measuring binding of binding molecules to TNFR2 and the ability of additional binding molecules to cross-block such binding to TNFR 2. In one embodiment, monovalent molecules comprising only one copy of the TNFR2 binding site are used to study the ability to cross-block. For example, the ability of scFv comprising a binding site to cross-block scFv that differ from one of the specific binding molecules listed herein only in having a TNFR2 binding site was investigated. In another embodiment, the ability of actual binding molecules to cross block each other was studied without converting them into scFv molecules. In another embodiment, the binding molecules of the invention will be capable of blocking or reducing the binding of tnf\u03b1 to TNFR 2. In another embodiment, the binding molecules of the invention will be capable of reducing or blocking the binding of lymphotoxin- \u03b1 to TNFR 2. </p>In one embodiment, the binding molecules of the invention, particularly binding domains in antibodies, have an affinity for TNFR2 of about 400nM or less, 200nM or less, e.g., K of about 100nM, 50nM, 20nM, 10nM, 1nM, 500pM, 250pM, 200pM, 100pM or less <sub>D</sub> . In one embodiment, the binding affinity is 50pM or less. For example, in one embodiment, a single TNFR2 binding site in a binding molecule of the invention will exhibit such affinity for TNFR2, rather than the overall affinity for the binding molecule. In one embodiment, this affinity is the overall affinity of the antibody for TNFR 2. In one embodiment, the affinity of the individual antigen binding sites of the binding molecules of the invention may be smallAt 1 \u03bcM, less than 750nM, less than 500nM, less than 250nM, less than 200nM, less than 150nM, less than 100nM, less than 75nM, less than 50nM, less than 10nM, less than 1nM, less than 0.1nM, less than 10pM, less than 1pM, or less than 0.1pM. In some embodiments, kd is about 0.1pM to about 1 \u03bcm.</p>In one embodiment, the antibody of the invention is a monoclonal antibody. In one embodiment, the antibody of the invention is an IgG1, igG2 or IgG4 antibody or a heavy chain constant region comprising such an antibody. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the antibodies of the invention are or include IgG1 isotype antibodies. In a preferred embodiment, the constant region employed is a human IgG constant region. In a particularly preferred embodiment, a human IgG1 constant region is used. It may have any of the modifications listed herein. Without particular limitation, the term \"antibody\" encompasses antibodies from any suitable source species, including chickens, sharks, and mammals such as mice, hamsters, rabbits, goats, cows, llamas, non-human primates, and humans. In a preferred embodiment, the antibody of the invention is a humanized antibody. In another preferred embodiment, the binding molecules of the invention, in particular antibodies, are fully human. Non-limiting examples of methods of producing humanized antibodies are known in the art, for example from Riechmann et al (Nature.1988, 24.3; 332 (6162): 323-7) or Jones et al (Nature.1986, 29.6, 4.4; 321 (6069): 522-5). In a further preferred embodiment, the antibody of the invention is a human antibody. As discussed herein, the binding molecules of the invention, particularly antibodies, may include non-human sequences, such as tenascin-c peptide, but in a preferred embodimen",
    " 31, the variants showed good specific binding to TNFR 2.</p>Equivalent experiments were also performed using TNFR2 from different species, i.e. from mice (i.e. mice), cynomolgus monkeys (cynomolgus macaques) and black-face green monkeys (african green monkeys), to investigate the ability of the VHH region to bind to TNFR2 from different species. The ability to cross-react with TNFR2 from different species facilitates the study of antibodies in various models prior to evaluation of human patients. The results from the experiments are listed in table 8 below, where \"n.s.b.\" indicates no specific binding. </p>Table 8: binding of VHH antibodies to TNFR2 proteins from different species</p></p>Example 27: hexavalent antibodies using VHH antibody domains</p>To investigate the effect of antibody formats on binding affinity, VHH domain antibodies were next used to make hexavalent antibodies, wherein 3 xhvhh-Fc-GpL format antibodies were generated against multiple VHH antibody domains. All VHH domains within a given hexavalent antibody are identical. Equilibrium binding of those antibodies was then investigated in the same manner as in example 26. FIG. 32 shows the results of equilibrated binding of the indicated TNFR 2-specific 3xVHH-Fc-GpL sdAb construct to cells expressing human TNFR2 at 37 \u2103. GpL reporter domains have been cloned into the C-terminus of the Fc domain. Remarkably, the results obtained show that hexavalent format antibodies exhibit high affinity binding, wherein the Kd variation between different VHHs is typically much lower than the results for bivalent antibodies shown in fig. 31. It is believed that when binding affinity is involved, the result of having multiple binding sites in close spatial proximity in hexavalent and higher valent formats may be more important than specific (bivalent) VHHs, which shows the robust binding properties of hexavalent formats.</p>Example 28: assessment of blocking TNFa binding to TNFR2 </p>The ability of VHH-Fc (DANA) hexavalent format antibodies with the VHH: C18, VHH: C74, VHH: C188 or VHH: C238 VHH domain as binding site to block TNF\u03b1 binding to TNFR2 was compared. The results obtained are shown in fig. 33. HT1080-Bcl2-TNFR2 cells were pretreated with either the indicated amount of TNFR 2-specific sdAb construct or with the CD 40-specific construct 3xVHH: CD40 (V12 t) -Fc (DANA) as a negative control, since the construct is specific for CD40 but not TNFR 2. 5ng/ml GpL-TNF was added to all samples and binding was measured after incubation at 37\u2103for 1 hour. The leftmost column in fig. 33 shows the results of the positive control, i.e. in the absence of another construct, tnf\u03b1 was therefore 100% bound to TNFR 2. The subsequent columns show the results of the indicated constructs, the activity of which is expressed as a percentage of the negative control value. All 3xVHH-Fc (DANA) variants of the hexavalent antibody formats of VHH: C18, VHH: C74, VHH: C188 and VHH: C238 showed the ability to effectively ",
    "TNF 80.</p>The serum retention of Fc (DANA) -TNC-muTNF80 was next studied and the results obtained are shown in FIG. 48. The IL-8 concentration in the supernatant of HT1080-Bcl2-TNFR2 cell culture stimulated with serum isolated from the peripheral blood of wild-type mice at a given time point, which were injected with 75. Mu.g of Fc (DANA) -TNC-muTNF80 or isotype control antibody at 0 hours, was measured by ELISA. The data is shown in fig. 48.</p>Example 44: ligand-based TNFR2 agonists expand tregs and up-regulate activation markers in vivo.</p>The ability of ligand-based TNFR2 agonists to expand tregs and up-regulate activation markers in vivo was next studied, and the results obtained are shown in fig. 49. (A) Treg frequency of viable cells in isolated spleens four days after stimulation with 75 \u03bcg fc (DANA) -TNC-muTNF80 in wild-type mice. (B) Fold change of selected extracellular markers, defined as Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) measured for Treg, and normalized to isotype control antibody samples. The data is shown in fig. 49.</p>Example 45: TNFR2 agonists increase spleen tregs in vivo.</p>Treg frequency was determined in spleens of huTNFR2 expressing mice isolated four days after treatment of mice with 3xVHH: C188-Fc (DANA) or isotype control antibody or C4-IgG1 (N297A) -HC: scFv: C4. Fold changes relative to isotype control or untreated control were calculated in the same experiment. As shown in fig. 50, TNFR2 agonists can amplify tregs in the spleen of human TNFR2 KI mice in vivo. The mean value between the treated and control groups was compared by unpaired t-test. * p is less than or equal to 0.05, ns=no.</p>Example 46: TNFR2 agonists increase survival following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) induced acute graft versus host disease.</p>The effect of TNFR2 agonists in a graft versus host disease (GvHD) model was studied and the results obtained are shown in fig. 51. Panel (A) shows survival (FVB/N H-2) of allo-HCT induced experimental acute GvHD in mice <sup>q</sup> \u2192C57BL/6H-2 <sup>b</sup> MHC major mismatch model). Statistical significance was assessed using Log-Rank test between each TNFR2 agonist treated group and isotype control antibody. * p is less than or equal to 0.05. Panel (B) shows pathology scores for intestinal samples isolated on day 6 post allo-HCT based on immune cell infiltration and intestinal crypt injury. </p>Example 47: TNFR2 agonists amplify tregs from Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) of african green monkeys (long-tailed black jaw monkeys).</p>Thawing frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cells of African green monkey at 2X10 per well <sup>5</sup> The cells were cultured and either untreated or treated with 1, 10, 100, 1000ng/mL C4-IgG1 (N297A) -HC: scFvC4 for 5 days at 37 \u2103. Samples were measured using flow cytometry and tregs were characterized as cd3+cd4+foxp3+ T cells. As shown in fig. 52, TNFR2 agonist treatment resulted in dose-dependent expansion of tregs from african gr"
