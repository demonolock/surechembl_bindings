    "fic diabodies, single-chain diabodies, and di-diabodies. However, each of these approaches have disadvantages. In addition, a multivalent antibody construct comprising two Fab repeats in the heavy chain of an IgG and capable of binding four antigen molecules has been described (see PCT Publication No. WO 0177342 and Miller et al. (2003) J. Immunol. 170(9): 4854-61 ). </p> [006] US Patent No. 7,612, 181 provides a novel family of binding proteins capable of binding two or more antigens with high affinity, which are called dual variable domain binding proteins (DVD binding protein) or dual variable domain </p>immunoglobulins (DVD-lg\u2122). \n\n [007] While a variety of structures are provided in the art, some with advantages and disadvantages, specific constructs are required for preparing multivalent binding proteins with specific properties and which bind to specific targets. Additionally, new variable domain sequences can further improve the properties of the binding proteins. </p> [008] Interleukin 13 (IL-13) is a 17-kDa glycoprotein produced by activated T cells of the Th2 lineage. The function of IL-13 includes immunoglobulin isotype switching to IgE in human B cells and suppressing inflammatory cytokine production. IL-13 is associated primarily with the induction of airway inflammation such as asthma. It has also been linked to other allergic diseases, fibrotic conditions, cancer and infectious diseases. </p> [009] lnterleukin-17 (IL-17, also referred to as IL-17A) is a 20-30 kD homodimeric glycoprotein secreted by activated T cells at the site of inflammation. IL- 17 acts as a proinflammatory cytokine by inducing the production of multiple adhesion molecules, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in various tissues to recruit monocytes and neutrophils to the site of inflammation. IL-17 also plays an important role in the maturation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Inappropriate or excessive production of IL-17 is associated with the pathology of various diseases or disorders including rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, lupus, allograft rejection, other inflammatory or autoimmune diseases and cancer. </p> [010] There is a need in the art for improved multivalent binding proteins capable of binding IL-13 and/or IL-17. Novel binding proteins that bind IL-13 and IL-17 are provided herein. </p>Summary </p> [01 1 ] Binding proteins capable of binding IL-13 and/or IL-17 are provided. In an embodiment, binding proteins capable of binding IL-13 and/or IL-17 with high affinity are provided. </p> [012] In one embodiment, binding proteins comprising a polypeptide chain that binds IL-13 and/or IL-17, wherein the polypeptide chain comprises VD1 -(X1 )n-VD2- C-(X2)n, wherein VD1 is a first variable domain, VD2 is a second variable domain, C is a constant domain, X1 represents an amino acid or polypeptide, X2 represents an Fc region and n is 0 or 1 , are provided. In an embodiment, the VD1 and VD2 in the binding protein are heavy chain variable domains. In another ",
    "on resonance\" means an optical phenomenon that allows for the analysis of real-time biospecific interactions by detection of alterations in protein concentrations within a biosensor matrix, for example using the BIAcore\u00ae system (BIAcore International AB, a GE Healthcare company, Uppsala, Sweden and Piscataway, NJ). For further descriptions, see Jonsson et al. (1993) Ann. Biol. Clin. 51 : 19-26. The term \"K<sub>on</sub>\" means the on rate constant for association of a binding protein (e.g., an antibody or DVD-lg protein) to the antigen to form the, e.g., DVD-lg/antigen complex. The term \"K<sub>on</sub>\" also means \"association rate constant\", or</p>\"ka\", as is used interchangeably herein. This value indicating the binding rate of a \n\n binding protein to its target antigen or the rate of complex formation between a binding protein, e.g., an antibody, and antigen also is shown by the equation below: </p>Antibody (\"Ab\") + Antigen (\"Ag\")\u2192Ab-Ag </p>[0107] The term \"K<sub>0</sub>ff\" <sup>means</sup> the off rate constant for dissociation, or \"dissociation rate constant\", of a binding protein (e.g., an antibody or DVD-lg protein) from the, e.g., DVD-lg protein/antigen complex as is known in the art. This value indicates the dissociation rate of a binding protein, e.g., an antibody, from its target antigen or separation of Ab-Ag complex over time into free antibody and antigen as shown by the equation below: </p>Ab + Ag&lt;-Ab-Ag </p> [0108] The terms \"K<sub>d</sub>\" and \"equilibrium dissociation constant\" means the value obtained in a titration measurement at equilibrium, or by dividing the dissociation rate constant (K<sub>0</sub>ff) by the association rate constant (K<sub>on</sub>). The association rate constant, the dissociation rate constant and the equilibrium dissociation constant, are used to represent the binding affinity of a binding protein (e.g., an antibody or DVD-lg protein) to an antigen. Methods for determining association and dissociation rate constants are well known in the art. Using fluorescence-based techniques offers high sensitivity and the ability to examine samples in physiological buffers at equilibrium. Other </p>experimental approaches and instruments such as a BIAcore\u00ae (biomolecular interaction analysis) assay, can be used (e.g., instrument available from BIAcore International AB, a GE Healthcare company, Uppsala, Sweden). Additionally, a </p>KinExA\u00ae (Kinetic Exclusion Assay) assay, available from Sapidyne Instruments (Boise, Idaho), can also be used. </p> [0109] The term \"variant\" means a polypeptide that differs from a given polypeptide in amino acid sequence by the addition (e.g., insertion), deletion, or conservative substitution of amino acids, but that retains the biological activity of the given polypeptide (e.g., a variant IL-17 antibody can compete with anti-IL-17 antibody for binding to IL-17). A conservative substitution of an amino acid, i.e., replacing an amino acid with a different amino acid of similar properties (e.g., hydrophilicity and degree and distribution of charged regions) is recognized in the art as typically involving a minor change. These minor changes can be identified, in part, by considering the hydropathic index of amino acids, as understood in the art (see, e.g., Kyte et al. (1",
    "C, 5% C0<sub>2</sub> until the addition of IL- 13 and antibody or DVD-lg protein. A 20 \u03bcg/mL working stock of antibody or DVD-lg protein (4x concentrated) was prepared in complete F12 medium. An eight point serial dilution was performed (5 \u03bcg/mL-0.0003 \u03bcg/mL) in complete F12 in Marsh dilution plates. Sixty uL /well of each antibody or DVD-lg protein dilution was added in quadruplicate to a 96 well v-bottom (Costar# 3894) plate and 60 \u03bc\u0390 of a 4x </p>concentrated (20 ng/mL) solution of IL-13 was added to all wells except the cell only control. Following a 1 hour incubation, 100 \u03bc\u0390 of the above IL-13/Antibody or DVD-lg protein complex was added to the A549 cells. All well volumes were equal to 200 \u03bc\u0390. The final concentration of recombinant IL-13 was 5 ng/mL and rhTNF-a was 200 ng/mL. All plate reagents were then 1 x concentrated. After a 16-20 hour incubation, the well contents (200 \u03bc\u0390) were transferred into a 96-well round bottom plate (Costar# 3799) and placed in a -20\u00b0C freezer. The supernatants were tested for hTARC levels by ELISA in the Assay Lab. Neutralization potency was determined by calculating percent inhibition relative to the 5 ng/mL IL-13 alone control value. Reported IC<sub>S0</sub> values (sigmoidal curve dose responses) were calculated using GraphPad Prism. </p>Table 6: IL-13 Neutralization Assay With IL-13 Parent Antibody and DVD-lg Protein \n\n \n\n Antibody or Variable Variable IL13 IL13 DVD-lg ID Domain (VD) Domain (VD) Neutralization Neutralization </p> Assay IC50 nM AssaylC50 nM </p>AB397 IL-13 (SEQ 1) 0.033 </p> AB398 IL-13(SEQ 2) 0.082 </p> AB399 IL-13 (SEQ 3) 0.043 </p> DVD2148 IL-13 (SEQ 1) IL-17 (SEQ 1) 0.054 NA</p>DVD2149 IL-17 (SEQ 1) IL-13 (SEQ 1) NA 1.426</p>DVD2150 IL-13 (SEQ 1) IL-17 (SEQ 1) 0.099 NA</p>DVD2151 IL-17 (SEQ 1) IL-13 (SEQ 1) NA 0.526</p>DVD2152 IL-13 (SEQ 1) IL-17 (SEQ 1) 0.112 NA</p>DVD2153 IL-17 (SEQ 1) IL-13 (SEQ 1) NA 2.442</p>DVD2154 IL-13 (SEQ 1) IL-17 (SEQ 2) 0.430 NA</p>DVD2155 IL-17 (SEQ 2) IL-13 (SEQ 1) NA 1.180</p>DVD2156 IL-13 (SEQ 1) IL-17 (SEQ 2) 0.129 NA</p>DVD2157 IL-17 (SEQ 2) IL-13 (SEQ 1) NA 0.244</p>DVD2158 IL-13 (SEQ 1) IL-17 (SEQ 2) 0.131 NA</p>DVD2159 IL-17 (SEQ 2) IL-13 (SEQ 1) NA 0.876</p>DVD2160 IL-13 (SEQ 1) IL-17 (SEQ 3) 0.178 NA</p>DVD2161 IL-17 (SEQ 3) IL-13 (SEQ 1) NA 0.812</p>DVD2162 IL-13 (SEQ 1) IL-17 (SEQ 3) 0.126 NA</p>DVD2163 IL-17 (SEQ 3) IL-13 (SEQ 1) NA 0.195</p>DVD2164 IL-13 (SEQ 1) IL-17 (SEQ 3) 0.146 NA</p>DVD2165 IL-17 (SEQ 3) IL-13 (SEQ 1) NA 0.355</p>DVD2166 IL-13 (SEQ 2) IL-17 (SEQ 1) 0.089 NA</p>DVD2167 IL-17 (SEQ 1) IL-13 (SEQ 2) NA 1.700</p>DVD2168 IL-13 (SEQ 2) IL-17 (SEQ 1) 0.119 NA</p>DVD2169 IL-17 (SEQ 1) IL-13 (SEQ 2) NA 0.309</p>DVD2170 IL-13 (SEQ 2) IL-17 (SEQ 1) 0.106 NA</p>DVD2171 IL-17 (SEQ 1) IL-13 (SEQ 2) NA 0.506</p>DVD2172 IL-13 (SEQ 2) IL-17 (SEQ 2) 0.111 NA</p>DVD2173 IL-17 (SEQ 2) IL-13 (SEQ 2) NA 2.136</p>DVD2174 IL-13 (SEQ 2) IL-17 (SEQ 2) 0.085 NA</p>DVD2175 IL-17 (SEQ 2) IL-13 (SEQ 2) NA 0.115</p>DVD2176 IL-13 (SEQ 2) IL-17 (SEQ 2) 0.1",
    " line (ATCC #CRL-1634) secretes IL-6 in response to IL-17. The IL-17-induced IL-6 secretion is inhibited by neutralizing anti-IL- 17 antibodies (See, e.g., J. Imm. 155:5483-5486 (1995) or Cytokine 9:794-800 (1997)). </p> [0 93] HS27 cells were maintained in assay medium (DMEM high glucose medium (Gibco #1 1965) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco#26140), 4 mM L- glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, penicillin G (100 U/500 ml) and streptomycin (100 Mg/500 ml)). Cells were grown in T 50 flasks until they were about 80-90% confluent the day of the assay. Human IL-17 (R&amp;D Systems, #317-IL/CF) was reconstituted in sterile PBS without Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, stored frozen, freshly thawed for use and diluted to 40 ng/ml (4X) in assay medium. Serial dilutions of antibodies were made in a separate plate (4X concentrations), mixed with an equal volume of 40ng/ml (4X) of human IL-17 and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. HS27 cells (typically about 20,000 cells in 50 \u03bc\u0399 assay medium) were added to each well of a 96-well flat-bottom tissue culture plate (Costar #3599), followed by the addition of 50 \u03bc\u0399 of the pre-incubated antibody or DVD-lg protein plus IL-17 mix. The final concentration of IL-17 was 10ng/ml. Cells were incubated for about 24 hours at 37\u00b0C. The media supernatants were then collected. The level of IL- 17 neutralization was measured by determination of IL-6 amounts in supernatant using a commercial Meso Scale Discovery kit according to manufacturer's instructions. IC50 values were obtained using logarithm of antibody or DVD-lg protein vs. IL-6 amount variable slope fit. </p>Table 7: IL-17 Neutralization Assay With IL-17 Parent Antibody and DVD-lg Protein \n\n \n\n Antibody Variable Variable IL17 IL17 Neutralization or DVD-lg Domain (VD) Domain (VD) Neutralization Assay IC50 nM ID Assay IC50 nM </p> AB273 IL-17 (SEQ 1 ) 0.0198 </p> AB274 IL-17 (SEQ 2) 0.003 </p> AB275 IL-17 (SEQ 3) 0.0052 </p> DVD2148 IL-13 (SEQ 1 ) IL-17 (SEQ 1 ) NA 0.01 16</p>DVD2149 IL-17 (SEQ 1 ) IL-13 (SEQ 1 ) 0.0028 NA</p>DVD2150 IL-13 (SEQ 1 ) IL-17 (SEQ 1 ) NA 0.004</p>DVD2151 IL-17 (SEQ 1 ) IL-13 (SEQ 1 ) 0.0179 NA</p>DVD2152 IL-13 (SEQ 1 ) IL-17 (SEQ 1 ) NA 0.0069</p>DVD2153 IL-17 (SEQ 1 ) IL-13 (SEQ 1 ) 0.0049 NA</p>DVD2154 IL-13 (SEQ 1 ) IL-17 (SEQ 2) NA 0.3508</p>DVD2155 IL-17 (SEQ 2) IL-13 (SEQ 1 ) 0.0078 NA</p>DVD2156 IL-13 (SEQ 1 ) IL-17 (SEQ 2) NA 0.0155</p>DVD2157 IL-17 (SEQ 2) IL-13 (SEQ 1 ) 0.0066 NA</p>DVD2158 IL-13 (SEQ 1 ) IL-17 (SEQ 2) NA 0.0998</p>DVD2159 IL-17 (SEQ 2) IL-13 (SEQ 1 ) 0.0081 NA</p>DVD2160 IL-13 (SEQ 1 ) IL-17 (SEQ 3) NA 0.7034</p>DVD2161 IL-17 (SEQ 3) IL-13 (SEQ 1 ) 0.0144 NA</p>DVD2162 IL-13 (SEQ 1 ) IL-17 (SEQ 3) NA 0.0213</p>DVD2163 IL-17 (SEQ 3) IL-13 (SEQ 1 ) 0.0151 NA</p>DVD2164 IL-13 (SEQ 1 ) IL-17 (SEQ 3) NA 0.1354</p>DVD2165 IL-17 (SEQ 3) IL-13 (SEQ 1 ) 0.0133 NA</p>DVD2166 IL-13 (SEQ 2) IL-17 (SEQ 1 ) NA 0.0164</p>DVD2167 IL-17 (SEQ 1 ) IL-13 (SEQ 2) 0.0029 NA</p>DVD2168 IL-13 (SEQ 2) IL-17 (SEQ 1 ) NA 0.0025</p>DVD2169 IL-17 (SEQ 1 ) IL-13 (SEQ 2) 0.0021 NA</p>DVD2170 IL-13 (SEQ 2) IL-17 (SEQ 1 ) NA 0.0053</p>DVD2171 IL-17 (SEQ 1 ) IL-13 (SEQ 2) 0.001 1 NA</p>DVD2172 IL-13 (SEQ 2) IL-17 (SEQ 2) NA 0.6781</p>DVD2173 IL-17 (SEQ 2) IL-13 (SEQ 2) 0.008 NA</p>DVD2174 IL-13 (SEQ 2) IL-17 (SEQ 2) NA 0.0126</p>DVD2175 IL-17 (SEQ 2) IL-13 (SEQ 2) 0.",
    "approximately 5000 RU of goat anti-mouse IgG, (Fey), fragment specific polyclonal antibody (Pierce Biotechnology Inc, Rockford, IL) diluted in 10 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.5) was directly immobilized across a CM5 research grade biosensor chip using a standard amine coupling kit according to manufacturer's instructions and procedures at 25 \u03bcg/ml. Unreacted moieties on the biosensor surface were blocked with ethanolamine. Modified carboxymethyl dextran surface in flowcell 2 and 4 was used as a reaction surface. Unmodified carboxymethyl dextran without goat anti-mouse IgG in flow cell 1 and 3 was used as the reference surface. For kinetic analysis, rate equations derived from the 1 : 1 Langmuir binding model were fitted simultaneously to association and dissociation phases of all eight injections (using global fit analysis) with the use of Biaevaluation 4.0.1 software. Purified antibodies or DVD-lg proteins were diluted in HEPES-buffered saline for capture across goat anti- \n\n mouse IgG specific reaction surfaces. Antibodies or DVD-lg proteins to be captured as a ligand (25 \u03bc9/\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u0399) were injected over reaction matrices at a flow rate of 5 \u03bc\u0399/minute. The association and dissociation rate constants, k<sub>on</sub> (M<sup>\"</sup>V<sup>1</sup>) and k<sub>0f</sub>r (s<sup>'1</sup>) were determined under a continuous flow rate of 25 \u03bc\u0399/minute. Rate constants were derived by making kinetic binding measurements at different antigen concentrations ranging from 10 - 200 nM. The equilibrium dissociation constant (M) of the reaction between antibodies or DVD-lg proteins and the target antigen was then calculated from the kinetic rate constants by the following formula: K<sub>D</sub> = k<sub>0ff</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>. Binding was recorded as a function of time and kinetic rate constants were calculated. In this assay, on-rates as fast as 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>\"</sup>V and off-rates as slow as 10<sup>\"6</sup> s<sup>\"1</sup> were measured. </p>Table 9: BIACORE Analysis of Parental Antibodies and DVD-lg Proteins </p>\n DVD2165 IL-17 (SEQ 3) 2.30E+06 3.20E-05 1.40E-11</p>DVD2165 IL-13 (SEQ 1) 2.60E+05 5.70E-05 2.20E-10</p>AB398 IL-13 (SEQ 2) 6.30E+05 2.80E-05 4.50E-11</p>AB273 IL-17 (SEQ 1) 2.00E+06 &lt;1.0e-6 &lt;5.0E-13</p>DVD2166 IL-13 (SEQ 2) 7.60E+05 2.60E-05 3.40E-11</p>DVD2166 IL-17 (SEQ 1) 1.30E+05 9.40E-06 7.50E-11</p>DVD2167 IL-17 (SEQ 1) 2.70E+06 &lt;1.0e-6 &lt;3.7E-13</p>DVD2167 IL-13 (SEQ 2) 2.10E+04 &lt;1.0e-6 &lt;4.8e-11</p>AB398 IL-13 (SEQ 2) 6.30E+05 2.80E-05 4.50E-11</p>AB273 IL-17 (SEQ 1) 2.00E+06 &lt;1.0e-6 &lt;5.0E-13</p>DVD2168 IL-13 (SEQ 2) 6.80E+05 3.70E-05 5.40E-11</p>DVD2168 IL-17 (SEQ 1) 4.00E+05 &lt;1.0e-6 &lt;2.5E-12</p>AB398 IL-13 (SEQ 2) 6.30E+05 2.80E-05 4.50E-11</p>AB273 IL-17 (SEQ 1) 2.00E+06 &lt;1.0e-6 &lt;5.0E-13</p>DVD2171 IL-17 (SEQ 1) 1.90E+06 2.10E-05 1.10E-11</p>DVD2171 IL-13 (SEQ 2) 2.00E+05 &lt;1.0e-6 &lt;5e-12</p>AB398 IL-13 (SEQ 2) 6.30E+05 2.80E-05 4.50E- 1</p>AB274 IL-17 (SEQ 2) 1.10E+06 8.20E-06 7.40E-12</p>DVD2172 IL-13 (S"
