The corresponding residues of the BBS on FZD1-7, FZD9, and FZD10 are identified in Table 1, below, and FIG. 8. In certain embodiments, an agent that blocks binding of a ligand (e.g., a Wnt) to the FZD inhibits the binding of the ligand to the BBS. It is understood that in certain embodiments, the agents which bind to at least part of the BBS may also bind one or more regions elsewhere (i.e., outside of the BBS) on the human frizzled receptor. In other words, in certain embodiments, the epitope to which the FZD-binding agent or antibody binds is a region within the extracellular domain of the FZD receptor that overlaps with the",
    "e herein in its entirety).</p>For example, the specific binding of an antibody to a human frizzled receptor may be determined using ELISA. An ELISA assay comprises preparing antigen, coating wells of a 96 well microtiter plate with antigen, adding the FZD-binding antibody or other FZD-binding agent conjugated to a detectable compound such as an enzymatic substrate (e.g. horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase) to the well, incubating for a period of time and detecting the presence of the antigen. In some embodiments, the FZD-binding antibody or agent is not conjugated to a detectable compound, but instead a second conjugated antibody that recognizes the FZD-binding antibody or agent is added to the well. In some embodiments, instead of coating the well with the antigen, the FZD-binding antibody or agent can be coated to the well and a second antibody conjugated to a detectable compound can be added following the addition of the antigen to the coated well. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected as well as other variations of ELISAs known in the art (see e.g. Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York at 11.2.1).</p>The binding affinity of an antibody or other agent to a human frizzled receptor and the off-rate of an antibody-antigen interaction can be determined by competitive binding assays. One example of a competitive binding assay is a radioimmunoassay comprising the incubation of labeled antigen (e.g. <sup>3</sup>H or <sup>125</sup>I), or fragment or variant thereof, with the antibody of interest in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled antigen followed by the detection of the antibody bound to the labeled antigen. The affinity of the antibody against a frizzled receptor and the binding off-rates can be determined from the data by scatchard plot analysis. In some embodiments, BIAcore kinetic analysis is used to determine the binding on and off rates of antibodies or agents that bind one or more human frizzled receptors. BIAcore kinetic analysis comprises analyzing the binding and dissociation of antibodies from chips with immobilized FZD antigens on their surface.</p>In certain embodiments, the agent (e.g., antibody) is an antagonist of at least one human frizzled receptor (i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 FZDs) bound by the agent. In certain embodiments, the agent inhibits at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 50%, at least about 75%, at least about 90%, or about 100% of one or more activity of the bound human frizzled receptor.</p>In certain embodiments, the FZD-binding agent inhibits binding of a ligand to the at least one human frizzled receptor.

DNA encoding the heavy chains and light chains of the 18R8 IgG2 antibody was deposited with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), 10801 University Boulevard, Manassas, Va., USA, under the conditions of the Budapest Treaty on Sep. 29, 2008, and assigned ATCC deposit designation number PTA-9540. In certain embodiments, the FZD-binding agent comprises the heavy chains and light chains of the 18R5 IgG2 antibody (with or without the leader sequence). In certain embodiments, the FZD-binding agent is the 18R5 IgG2 antibody. DNA encoding the heavy chains and light chains of the 18R5 IgG2 antibody was deposited with the ATCC, under the conditions of the Budapest Treaty on Sep. 29, 2008, and assigned ATCC deposit designation number PTA-9541.</p>In certain embodiments, the FZD-binding agent is an IgG antibody encoded by the plasmid deposited with the ATCC on Aug. 26, 2009, and assigned deposit designation number PTA-10307, PTA-10309, or PTA-10311.</p>In certain embodiments, the FZD-binding agent is an agent that competes for specific binding to FZD1, FZD2, FZD5, FZD7, and/or FZD8 with an antibody encoded by the plasmid having ATCC deposit designation number PTA-9540, PTA-9541, PTA-10307, or PTA-10309 (e.g., in a competitive binding assay). In certain alternative embodiments, the FZD-binding agent is an agent that competes for specific binding to FZD5 and/or FZD8 with an antibody encoded by the plasmid having ATCC deposit designation number PTA-10311.</p>In certain embodiments, the FZD-binding agent has a circulating half-life in mice, cynomologous monkeys, or humans of at least about 10 hours, at least about 24 hours, at least about 3 days, at least about 1 week, or at least about 2 weeks. In certain embodiments, the FZD-binding agent is an IgG (e.g., IgG1 or IgG2) antibody that has a circulating half-life in mice, cynomologous monkeys, or humans of at least about 10 hours, at least about 24 hours, at least about 3 days, at least about 1 week, or at least about 2 weeks. Methods of increasing the half-life of agents such as polypeptides and antibodies are known in the art. For example, known methods of increasing the circulating half-life of IgG antibodies include the introduction of mutations in the Fc region which increase the pH-dependent binding of the antibody to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) at pH 6.0 (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Pub. Nos. 2005/0276799, 2007/0148164, and 2007/0122403). Known methods of increasing the circulating half-life of antibody fragments lacking the Fc region include such techniques as PEGylation.</p>Polyclonal antibodies can be prepared by any known method. Polyclonal antibodies are raised by immunizing an animal (e.g. a rabbit, rat, mouse, donkey, etc) by multiple subcut",
    "ide fragment, full-length recombinant protein, fusion protein, etc) optionally conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), serum albumin, etc. diluted in sterile saline and combined with an adjuvant (e.g. Complete or Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant) to form a stable emulsion. The polyclonal antibody is then recovered from blood, ascites and the like, of an animal so immunized. Collected blood is clotted, and the serum decanted, clarified by centrifugation, and assayed for antibody titer. The polyclonal antibodies can be purified from serum or ascites according to standard methods in the art including affinity chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, etc.</p>Monoclonal antibodies can be prepared using hybridoma methods, such as those described by Kohler and Milstein (1975) Nature 256:495. Using the hybridoma method, a mouse, hamster, or other appropriate host animal, is immunized as described above to elicit the production by lymphocytes of antibodies that will specifically bind to an immunizing antigen. Lymphocytes can also be immunized in vitro. Following immunization, the lymphocytes are isolated and fused with a suitable myeloma cell line using, for example, polyethylene glycol, to form hybridoma cells that can then be selected away from unfused lymphocytes and myeloma cells. Hybridomas that produce monoclonal antibodies directed specifically against a chosen antigen as determined by immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, or by an in vitro binding assay (e.g. radioimmunoassay (RIA); enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)) can then be propagated either in vitro culture using standard methods (Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, Academic Press, 1986) or in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal. The monoclonal antibodies can then be purified from the culture medium or ascites fluid as described for polyclonal antibodies above.</p>Alternatively monoclonal antibodies can also be made using recombinant DNA methods as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567. The polynucleotides encoding a monoclonal antibody are isolated from mature B-cells or hybridoma cell, such as by RT-PCR using oligonucleotide primers that specifically amplify the genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody, and their sequence is determined using conventional procedures. The isolated polynucleotides encoding the heavy and light chains are then cloned into suitable expression vectors, which when transfected into host cells such as E. coli cells, simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, monoclonal antibodies are generated by the host cells. Also, recombinant monoclonal antibodies or fragments thereof of the desired species can be isolated from phage display libraries expressing CDRs of the desired species as described (McCafferty et al., 1990, Nature, 348:552-554; Clackson et al., 1991, Nature, 352:624-628; and Marks et al., 1991, J.

Antibodies were dosed at 10 mg/kg, IP, twice per week. Paclitaxel was dosed at 10 mg/kg, IP, once per week. Tumors were measured on the days indicated in FIG. 37. FIG. 38 shows the tumor growth of the individual animals in the 18R5 plus paclitaxel group. 18R5 plus paclitaxel treatment was shown to result in anti-tumor activity and regression of established breast tumors.</p>Example 8Assays to Determine Effect on Cancer Stem Cell FrequencyLimiting dilution assays (LDAs) can be used to assess the effect of a FZD-binding agent or antibody on solid tumor cancer stem cells and on the tumorigenicity of a tumor comprising the cancer stem cells. The assays can be used to determine the frequency of cancer stem cells in tumors from animals treated with the FZD-binding antibody or other agent and to compare that frequency to the frequency of cancer stem cells in tumors from control animals.</p>Effect of Combination Treatment of 18R5 and Irinotecan on Cancer Stem Cells in OMP-C28 Tumors</p>Control and treated tumors from the OMP-C28 xenograft study described above (Example 7) were harvested at the end of the study (day 48). The tumors were processed and dissociated into single cells. Tumor cells were then incubated with biotinylated mouse antibodies (\u03b1-mouse CD45-biotin 1:200 dilution and rat \u03b1-mouse H2 Kd-biotin 1:100 dilution, BioLegend, San Diego, Calif.) on ice for 30 min followed by addition of streptavidin-labeled magnetic beads (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) to remove mouse cells with the aid of a magnet.</p>For the LDA, the human cells in the suspension were harvested, counted, and appropriate cell doses (5, 25, and 125 cells) in FACS buffer were mixed in a 1:1 mixture with Matrigel and injected subcutaneously in NOD/SCID mice (10 mice per cell dose per treatment group). Tumors are allowed to grow for up to 4 months. At the desired time point, the percentage of mice with detectable tumors is determined in all groups injected with anti-FZD antibody treated tumor cells and compared to the percentage of mice with detectable tumors in the controls. For example, the number of mice injected with 125 control-treated tumor cells that have detectable tumors is determined and compared to the number of mice injected with 125 FZD-antibody treated tumor cells that have detectable tumors. The cancer stem cell frequency is then calculated using L-Calc\u2122 software (StemCell Technologies Inc.). Briefly, based on Poisson statistics, exactly one cancer stem cell exists among the known number of injected cells if 37% of the animals fail to develop tumors.</p>For analysis of cell surface markers, the single tumor cell suspension was stained with anti-ESA (Biomeda) and anti-CD44 (BD Biosciences) antibodies which were directly conjugated to fluorochromes. Dead cells were excluded by using the viability dye DAPI. Flow cytometry was performed using a FACS Aria (Becton Dickinson). Side scatter and forward scatter profiles were used to eliminate cell clumps. Analysis of the tumors treated with control antibody revealed that 64% of the bulk tumor population expressed both ESA and CD44 at high levels (FIG. 39). The double positive population was not significantly affected by treatment with irinotecan alone (55%), as shown in FIG. 39, but treatment with either 18R5 or the combination of 18R5 with irinotecan reduced the double positive population (40% and 32% respectively).</p>Effect of Combination Treatment of 18R5 and Gemcitabine on Cancer Stem Cells in OMP-Pn4 Tumors</p>Control and treated tumors from the OMP-Pn4 xenograft study described above (Example 7) were harvested at the end of 41 days treatment. The tumors were processed and dissociated into single cells. Tumor cells were then incubated with biotinylated mouse antibodies (\u03b1-mouse CD45-biotin 1:200 dilution and rat \u03b1-mouse H2 Kd-biotin 1:100 dilution, BioLegend, San Diego, Calif.) on ice for 30 min followed by addition of streptavidin-labeled magnetic beads (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) to remove mouse cells. The remaining human cells in the suspension were collected, counted and diluted to appropriate cell doses (30, 90, 270 and 810 cells), mixed in the mixture of 1:1 (v/v) FACS buffer and Matrigel and injected subcutaneously in NOD/SOD mice (10 mice per cell dose per treatment group). Tumors were allowed to grow for 75 days as shown in FIG. 40. Each dot in FIG. 40 represents the tumor volume of an individual mouse. The percentage of mice with detectable tumors was determined in all groups injected with anti-FZD antibody treated tumor cells and compared to the percentage of mice with detectable tumors in the controls. For example, the number of mice injected with 810 control-treated tumor cells that have detectable tumors was determined and compared to the number of mice injected with 810 FZD-antibody treated tumor cells that have detectable tumors. The tumor growth frequency was used to calculate the cancer stem cell frequency using L-Calc\u2122 software. The calculated cancer stem cell frequencies for each of the treatment groups are shown in FIG. 41. Treatment with 18R5 alone and treatment with 18R5 in combination with gemcitabine reduced cancer stem cell frequency, while treatment with gemcitabine alone had no effect.</p>Example 9Production of FZD AntibodiesAntigen Production</p>Recombinant polyp",
    "s, and single cell suspensions obtained by enzymatic digestion and mechanical disruption. Specifically, pleural effusion cells or the resulting tumor pieces are mixed with ultra-pure collagenase III in culture medium (200-250 units of collagenase per mL) and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 3-4 hours with pipetting up and down through a 10-mL pipette every 15-20 minutes. Digested cells are filtered through a 45 \u03bcM nylon mesh, washed with RPMI/20% FBS, and washed twice with HBSS. Dissociated tumor cells are then injected subcutaneously into the mammary fat pads of NOD/SCID mice to elicit tumor growth.</p>In certain embodiments, dissociated tumor cells are first sorted into tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic cells based on cell surface markers before injection into experimental animals. Specifically, tumor cells dissociated as described above are washed twice with Hepes buffered saline solution (HBSS) containing 2% heat-inactivated calf serum (HICS) and resuspended at 106 cells per 100 \u03bcl. Antibodies are added and the cells incubated for 20 minutes on ice followed by two washes with HBSS/2% HICS. Antibodies include anti-ESA (Biomeda, Foster City, Calif.), anti-CD44, anti-CD24, and Lineage markers anti-CD2, -CD3, -CD10, -CD16, -CD18, -CD31, -CD64, and -CD140b (collectively referred to as Lin; PharMingen, San Jose, Calif.). Antibodies are directly conjugated to fluorochromes to positively or negatively select cells expressing these markers. Mouse cells are eliminated by selecting against H2 Kd+ cells, and dead cells are eliminated by using the viability dye 7AAD. Flow cytometry is performed on a FACSVantage (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, N.J.). Side scatter and forward scatter profiles are used to eliminate cell clumps. Isolated ESA+, CD44+, CD24-/low, Lin-tumorigenic cells are then injected subcutaneously into NOD/SCID mice to elicit tumor growth.</p>By way of example, anti-FZD antibodies are analyzed for their ability to reduce the growth of tumor cells. Dissociated tumor cells (10,000 per animal) are injected subcutaneously into the flank region of 6-8 week old NOD/SCID mice. Two days after tumor cell injection, animals are injected intraperitoneal (i.p.) with 10 mg/kg either anti-FZD antibodies two times per week. Tumor growth is monitored weekly until growth is detected, after which point tumor growth is measured twice weekly for a total of 8 weeks. FZD-binding antibodies which significantly reduce tumor growth as compared to PBS injected controls are thus identified.</p>Example 13In Vivo Treatment of Tumors Using Anti-FZD Receptor AntibodiesThis example describes a use of anti-FZD receptor antibodies to treat cancer in a xenograft model. In certain embodiments, tumor cells from a patient sample (solid tumor biopsy or pleural effusion) that have been passaged as a xenograft in mice are prepared for repassaging into experimental animals. Tumor tissue is removed, cut up into small pieces, minced completely using sterile blades, and single cell suspensions",
    " White plates (Nunc #165306). The cells were incubated O.N. at 37\u00b0 C. and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. On day 2, the Abs to be tested were diluted to a final concentration of 40 \u03bcg/\u03bcl using culture medium. Seven 5-fold serial dilutions were performed. The STF-293 cells culture medium was replaced with a mixture containing 50 \u03bcl Ab dilution, 25 \u03bcl Wnt3a-conditioned medium from Wnt3a stable L-cells and 25 \u03bcl DMEM-10% FBS. For each Ab, the final concentrations tested were 20, 4, 0.8, 0.16, 0.03, 0.006, 0.0013, 0.0003 \u03bcg/ml. Each Ab concentration was tested in triplicate. A human anti-hapten Ab, LZ1, was used as negative control Ab. A non-Wnt3a-conditioned medium from parental L-cells was used as negative control inducer. The plates were returned to the incubator. Luciferase activity was measured on day 3, using Promega Steady Glo kit (VWR # PAE2550-A) according to the manufacturer specifications. The results were expressed in photons per sec. GraphPad Prism software was used to graph and analyze the data. Luciferase activities were plotted as a function of Ab concentration to establish dose-response curves. A non-linear regression was applied to the numbers to fit the curve and calculate IC50s.</p>The ability of 44R24 and 18R5 to inhibit Wnt signaling in STF cells was likewise determined and compared as described above. The results are shown in FIG. 48 and Table 14. 44R24 activity was only detected at higher Ab concentrations, reflecting the antibody's low activity in the assay. 44R24\u2032 s IC50 was calculated to be 13 fold lower than 18R5\u2032 s.</p>TABLE 14IC50s for inhibition of Wnt signalingin ST-293 cells by 18R5 and 44R2418R544R24IC50 (nM)2.7334.43</p>The ability of 18R5 and 44R24 to inhibit Wnt signaling in A549 cells was also determined. A549 cells are human lung carcinoma cells in which the Axin2 gene is highly expressed, translating endogenous activity of Wnt signaling. Axin2 is a well know Wnt target gene that responds to activation of the pathway by up-regulating its transcription and eventually down-regulating Wnt signaling through a feed-back loop mechanism. This system was used to test the impact of the anti-Fzd Abs on Axin2 mRNA levels by qPCR.</p>12-well plates were seeded with 30,000 A549 cells per well and grown for 3 days in DMEM+10% FBS. Antibodies were added at varying concentrations (5, 1, 0.2, 0.04, 0.008 \u03bcg/ml) for 24 hours and total RNA was extracted from the cells. LZ1, a nonbinding antibody, was used as negative control at only the highest concentration.</p>30,000 A549 cells were seeded into 12-well plates and grown for 3 days in DMEM+10% FBS. Anti-FZD antibody 18R5 or 44R24 were added at varying concentrations (5, 1, 0.2, 0.04, 0.008 \u03bcg/ml), and LZ1, a nonbinding antibody, was used as a negative control at only the highest concentration. RNA was made 24 hours post treatment and then treated with Dnase.</p>Axin2 is known to be a robust target gene in Wnt signaling and its expression level was examined by doing a Taqman relative expression (\u0394\u0394CT) assay using an Applied Biosystems 7900 HT machine. 50 ng of RNA was used per point in triplicate and a GUSB probe was used for endogenous control. All results were normalized to Axin2 levels in the LZ1 control sample.</p>The dose response curve showing the inhibition of basal level of axin2 gene expression by 18R5 and 44R24 and the calculated EC50 values for these antibodies are shown in FIG. 49. 18R5 and 44R24 inhibit Axin2 basal levels relative to LZ1 control with comparable efficiencies.</p>Example 21Evaluation of Anti-Tumor Activity of Anti-FZD mAbs in Pancreatic Xenograft ModelsOMP-PN13 Pancreatic Tumors:Frozen OMP-PN13 tumor cells that have been passaged twice in mice were obtained from Oncomed's tumor bank. They were thawed and injected subcutaneously into the left flank of NOD/SCID mice immediately following thawing. \u02dc25,000 viable cells were injected per animal. The mice were monitored weekly for tumor growth. After their onset, the size of the tumors was measured once weekly by caliper. 200-300 mm<sup>3 </sup>tumor-bearing mice were dispatched in treatment groups that each contained 5 animals. The average tumor size was comparable in each group. Ab treatment was initiated the day after randomization. LZ1 was used as the negative control Ab. 3 doses of 10 mg/kg of Ab were administered via intra-peritoneal injection over a 12-day period. Mice were euthanized 24 hours after the last injection. Tumor, duodenum and liver were harvested.</p>Tumor tissues were fixed in formalin for paraffin embedding and sectioning. Muc16 detection was performed by immunohistochemical (IHC) to monitor the appearance of Mucin-producing cells. Mucins are specific for a subtype of differentiated cells in the pancreas, and as such are used as differentiation markers in the tumor model.</p>Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) se",
    "mmunofluorescence on control mAb (upper panel) and 18R5 (lower panel)\u2014treated OMP-PN4 tumors. Reduced amounts of SMAa was detected on the 18R5-treated tumors. The expression of ACTA2 and the amount of SMA were dramatically reduced in the tumor stroma in response to 18R5, suggesting that Wnt blockade (i) impacts this tumor compartment and (ii) does so by reducing a well established tumorgenicity marker. These results suggest that reduction of myofibroblast activation may be one of 18R5\u2032 s anti-tumor mechanisms of action.</p>Example 22Evaluation of the Tumorgenic Potential of Muc16-Positive OMP-PN13 CellsAs described above, 18R5 treatment induced gene expression and cell phenotype changes in pancreatic tumors, including increased mucin expression. In particular, IHC performed on treated PN-13 tumors revealed an increased number of Muc16-positive cells. Muc16 gene expression levels were also higher in treated tumors than in control tumors. The tumorigenicity of the 18R5-induced Muc16-positive cells was assessed to test the hypothesis that the 18R5-induced Muc16-positive cells are representative of a differentiated tumor cell sub-population.</p>OMP-PN13-bearing mice were treated with 18R5 according to the protocol described in Example 21. Mice were euthanized 12 days after initiation of the Ab treatment. Tumors were harvested and processed to obtain a single cell suspension using collagenase III to digest the tissues. Mouse stromal cells were stained with a biotinylated anti-H-2 Kd antibody and a biotinylated anti-CD45 antibody. They were then incubated with magnetic beads conjugated to streptavidin (Thermo MagnaBind) and depleted using a Dynal magnet. The resulting lin-depleted tumor cells were stained with an anti-Muc16 mAb detected with a PE-conjugated secondary Ab. Muc16-positive and Muc16-negative cells were sorted using an ARIA FACS machine ran by the DIVA software. See FIG. 52A. Cells were re-injected subcutaneously in the left flank of NOD/SCID mice for comparison of their tumorgenic potentials. Each cell type was injected into 10 mice. Each mouse received 75 cells. Representative pictures of tumors resulting from the injection of Muc16\u2212 (upper panel) and Muc16+ (lower panel) cells are shown in FIG. 52B. The growth curves for the Muc16\u2212 and Muc16+ tumors following injection into the mice are shown in FIG. 52C. No tumor grew after injection of the Muc16+ cells, while 7 of the 10 mice injected with the Muc16\u2212 cells developed tumors. The data suggest that 18R5-induced Muc16+ cells are non-tumorgenic, supporting induction of differentiation as an underlying mechanism of 18R5 anti-tumor activity.</p>Example 23Additional In Vivo Studies with Anti-FZD AntibodiesPE13 breast tumor recurrence study with 18R5 mAb: PE13 breast tumor cells were injected into Nod-Scid mice and allowed to grow until the tumors had reached approximately 100 mm<sup>3</sup>.
