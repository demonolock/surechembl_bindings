    "at changes as little as 1% can be quantified. We have utilized DEXA to evaluate changes in bone mineral density due to estrogen deficiency following ovariectomy (surgical removal of ovaries) and treatment with vehicle, estradiol (E2), keoxifen (raloxifen), or other estrogen agonists. The purpose of these studies is to evaluate the ability of the compounds of this invention to prevent estrogen deficiency bone loss as measured by DEXA. </p>[0155] Female (S-D) rats 4-6 months of age undergo bilateral ovariectomy or sham surgery and allowed to recover from anesthesia. Rats are treated by s.c. injection or oral gavage with various doses (10-1000 \u03bcg/kg/day, for example) of compound of Formula I daily for 28 days. All compounds are weighed and dissolved in 10% ethanol in sterile saline. After 28 days the rats are killed and femora removed and defleshed. The femoral are positioned on a Hologic QDR1000W (Hologic, Inc. Waltham, Mass.) and bone mineral density is determined in the distal portion of the femur at a site from 1 cm to 2 cm from the distal end of the femur using the high resolution software supplied by Hologic. Bone mineral density is determined by dividing the bone mineral content by the bone area of the distal femur. Each group contains at least 6 animals. Mean bone mineral density is obtained for each animal and statistical differences (p&lt;0.05) from the vehicle-treated ovariectomy and sham-operated group were determined by t test. </p>[0156] In Vitro Estrogen Receptor Binding Assay </p>[0157] An in vitro estrogen receptor binding assay, which measures the ability of the compounds of the present invention to displace [3H]-estradiol from human estrogen receptor obtained by recombinant methods in yeast, is used to determine the estrogen receptor binding affinity of the compounds of this invention. The materials used in this assay are: (1) Assay buffer, TD-0.3 (containing 10 nM Tris, pH 7.6, 0.3 M potassium chloride and 5 mM DTT, pH 7.6); (2) The radioligand used is [3H]-estradiol obtained from New England Nuclear; (3) the cold ligand used is estradiol obtained from Sigma (4) recombinant human estrogen receptor, hER. </p>[0158] A solution of the compound being tested is prepared in TD-0.3 with 4% DMSO and 16% ethanol. The tritiated estradiol is dissolved in TD-0.3 such that the final concentration in the assay was 5nM. The hER is also diluted with TD-0.3 such that 4-10 \u03bcg of total protein was in each assay well. Using microtitre plates, each incubate received 50 \u03bcl of cold estradiol (nonspecific binding) or the compound solution, 20 \u03bcL of the tritiated estradiol and 30 \u03bcl of hER solutions. Each plate contains in triplicate total binding and varying concentrations of the compound. The plates are incubated overnight at 4\u00b0 C. The binding reaction is then terminated by the addition and mixing of 100 mL of 3% hydroxylapatite in 10 mM tris, pH 7.6 and incubation for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. The mixtures is centrifuged and the pellet washed four times with 1% Triton-X100 in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.6. The hydroxylapatite pellets are suspended in Ecoscint A and radioactivity is assessed using beta scintigraphy. The mean of all triplicate data points (counts per minute, cpm's) is determined. Specific binding is calculated by subtracting nonspecific cpm's (defined as counts that remain following separation of reaction mixture containing recombinant receptor, radioligand, and excess unlabeled ligand) from total bound cpm's (defined as counts that remain following the separation of reaction mixture containing only recombinant receptor, radioligand). Compound potency is determined by means of IC50 determinations (the concentration of a compound needed to inhibition 50% of the of the total specific tritiated estradiol bound). Specific binding in the presence of varying concentrations of compound is determined and calculated as percent specific binding of total specific radioligand bound. Data are plotted as percent inhibition by compound (linear scale) versus compound concentration (log scale). </p>[0159] Effect on Total Cholesterol Levels </p>[0160] The effect of the compounds of the present invention on plasma levels of total cholesterol is measured in the following way. Blood samples are collected via cardiac puncture from anesthetized female (S-D) rats 4-6 months of age that are bilaterally ovariectomized and treated with the compound (10-1000 \u03bcg/kg/day, for example, sc or orally for 28 days or with vehicle for the same time), or sham operated. The blood is placed in a tube containing 30\u03bcL of 5% EDTA (10\u03bcL EDTA/1 mL of blood). After centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 10 minutes at 20\u00b0 C. the plasma is removed and stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. unit assay. The total cholesterol is assayed using a standard enzymatic determination kit from Sigma Diagnostics (Procedure No. 352). </p>[0161] Effect on Obesity </p>[0162] Sprague-Dawley female rats at 10 months of age, weighing approximately 450 grams, are sham-operated (sham) or ovariectomized (OVX) and treated orally with vehicle, 17\u03b2 ethynyl estradiol at 30 \u03bcg/kg/day or a compound of formula I at 10-1000 \u03bcg/kg/day for 8 weeks.
