    "aspirin. Cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors are widely used as effective anti-inflammatory drugs with less potential for gastrointestinal complications as compared to traditional, non-selective non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs. However, the combined use of a cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor with low- dose aspirin for cardio protection may compromise the gastrointestinal safety of this class of compounds. By virtue of its activity as a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, the compounds of the invention would be expected to be gastric protective in this regard. See Fiorucci, et al. FASEB J. 17:1171-1173, 2003. Cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors for use with the invention include but are not limited to etoricoxib (ARCOXIA\u2122), celecoxib (CELEBREX\u00ae) and valdecoxib (BEXTRA\u2122). A compound of this invention in combination with a cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor could be administered in unit dosage form or separately to a patient on low-dose aspirin therapy. Alternatively, the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor could be administered in unit dosage form with low-dose aspirin, in which case a compound of this invention would be administered separately. All three active ingredients in unit dosage form is also encompassed. Conventional dosage amounts of the cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor and aspirin (for cardio protection) may be utilized. For example, aspirin could be administered at 81 mg once daily. \n\n In general, FLAP inhibitors can be identified as those compounds which have an IC50 in the \"FLAP Binding Assay\" that is less than or equal to 1 \u03bcM, and preferably 500 nM or less.</p>\n  The term \"patient\" includes mammals, especially humans, who use the instant active agents for the prevention or treatment of a medical condition. Administering of the drug to the patient includes both self-administration and administration to the patient by another person. The patient may be in need of treatment for an existing disease or medical condition, or may desire prophylactic treatment to prevent or reduce the risk of onset of atherosclerosis.</p>\n  The term \"therapeutically effective amount\" is intended to mean that amount of a drug or pharmaceutical agent that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, a system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. The term \"prophylactically effective amount\" is intended to mean that amount of a pharmaceutical drug that will prevent or reduce the risk of occurrence of the biological or medical event that is sought to be prevented in a tissue, a system, animal or human by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. An effective amount of a FLAP inhibitor in the method of this invention is in the range of about 0.001 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg of body weight per day, preferably 0.01 mg to about 10 mg per kg, and most preferably 0.1 to 1 mg per kg, in single or divided doses. A single daily dose is preferred but not necessary. On the other hand, it ma",

After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture is concentrated in vacuo and the crude residue is purified by flash chromatography to furnish the title compound 16c.</p>\n  Following procedures similar to that described above for Example 16c, the following compounds (*compounds can be racemic or chiral) can be prepared:</p>\n  \n    <img id=\"imgf000110_0001\" path=\"imgf000110_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/5111497/WO/20060921/A1/002006/09/89/12/imgf000110_0001.tif\"/>\n  </p>\n  \n    <img id=\"imgf000110_0002\" path=\"imgf000110_0002.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/5111485/WO/20060921/A1/002006/09/89/12/imgf000110_0002.tif\"/>\n\n    <img id=\"imgf000111_0002\" path=\"imgf000111_0002.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/5111403/WO/20060921/A1/002006/09/89/12/imgf000111_0002.tif\"/>\n  </p>\n  'The alcohol functionality can be masked as a benzyl ether in Step B.

The 100,000 x g pellet membranes were resuspended in Tris-Tween assay buffer (100 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.05% Tween 20) to yield a final protein concentration of 50 \u03bcg to 150 \u03bcg/ml. Aliquots (100 \u03bcl) of membrane suspension were added to 12 mm x 75 mm polypropylene tubes containing 100 \u03bcl Tris-Tween assay buffer, 30,000 cpm of Compound A in 5 \u03bcl MeOH:assay buffer (1:1), and 2 \u03bcl dimethyl sulfoxide or competitor (i.e., the compound to be tested) in dimethyl sulfoxide. Compound B (10 \u03bcM final concentration) was used to determine non-specific binding. After a 20 minute incubation at room temperature, tube contents were diluted to 4 ml with cold 0.1 M Tris HCl pH 7.4, 0.05% Tween 20 wash buffer and the membranes were collected by filtration of GFB filters presoaked in the wash buffer. Tubes and filters were rinsed with 2 x \n\n4 ml aliquots of cold wash buffer. Filters were transferred to 12 mm x 3.5 mm polystyrene tubes for determination of radioactivity by gamma-scintillation counting.</p>\n  Specific binding is defined as total binding minus non-specific binding. Total binding was Compound A bound to membranes in the absence of competitor; non-specific binding was Compound A bound in the presence of 10 uM Compound B. Preparation of Compound A is described in reference 1, below. The IC50 values were obtained by computer analysis (see reference 2, below) of the experimental data. Representative tested compounds of the invention were determined to have an IC50 &lt; 1 uM, and preferred compounds had IC50 &lt; 200 nM.</p>\n  REFERENCES:</p>\n  1.
