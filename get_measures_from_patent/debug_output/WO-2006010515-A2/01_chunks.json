Expression of the marker gene in response to induction or selection usually indicates expression of 5HT2a polynucleotide.</p>Alternatively, host cells which contain a 5HT2a polynucleotide and which express 5HT2a can be identified by a variety of procedures known to those of skill in the art. These procedures include, but are not limited to, DNA-DNA or DNA-RNA hybridizations and protein bioassay or immunoassay techniques which include membrane, solution, or chip-based technologies for the detection and/or quantification of nucleic acid or protein. For example, the presence of a poly- \n\n - -</p>nucleotide sequence encoding 5HT2a can be detected by DNA-DNA or DNA-RNA hybridization or amplification using probes or fragments or fragments of polynucleotides encoding 5HT2a. Nucleic acid amplification-based assays involve the use of oligonucleotides selected from sequences encoding 5HT2a to detect transformants which contain a 5HT2a polynucleotide.</p>A variety of protocols for detecting and measuring the expression of 5HT2a, using either polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies specific for the polypeptide, are known in the art. Examples include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay (RIA), and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). A two-site, monoclonal-based immunoassay using monoclonal antibodies reactive to two non-interfering epitopes on 5HT2a can be used, or a competitive binding assay can be employed.</p>A wide variety of labels and conjugation techniques are known by those skilled in the art and can be used in various nucleic acid and amino acid assays. Means for producing labeled hybridization or PCR probes for detecting sequences related to polynucleotides encoding 5HT2a include oligolabeling, nick translation, end-labeling, or PCR amplification using a labeled nucleotide. Alternatively, sequences encoding 5HT2a can be cloned into a vector for the production of an mRNA probe. Such vectors are known in the art, are commercially available, and can be used to synthesize RNA probes in vitro by addition of labeled nucleotides and an appropriate RNA polymerase such as T7, T3, or SP6. These procedures can be conducted using a variety of commercially available kits (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Promega, and US Biochemical).

Moreover, 5HT2a can be derived from any suitable mammalian species (e.g., human 5HT2a, rat 5HT2a or murine 5HT2a). The assay can be a binding assay entailing direct or indirect measurement of the binding of a test compound or a known 5HT2a ligand to 5HT2a.
