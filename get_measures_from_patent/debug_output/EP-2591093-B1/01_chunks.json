    "nt invention. The invention may be better understood by reference to one or more of these drawings in combination with the detailed description of specific embodiments presented herein.\nFIG. 1. Alternative approaches for endothelial cell differentiation from human ESCs/iPSCs. ECs can be efficiently induced from human ESCs/iPSCs via expression of appropriate transgene(s) (top box), bypassing most, if not all, developmental stages observed during normal differentiation (bottom box).FIG. 2. The strategy employed for identifying transgenes that directly convert human ESC/iPSCs to endothelial cells. Human ESCs/iPSCs were engineered to constitutively express rtTET protein for inducible gene expression. Transgenes under the control of the inducible promoter Ptight are introduced into the engineered hESCs/iPSCs by electroporation. Upon doxycycline (Dox) addition, transgene expression is induced, and EC differentiation is monitored by the characteristic EC morphology, along with expression of EC markers (CD31, CD144 (VE-cadherin)) by flow cytometry.FIG. 3. The establishment of human ESC/iPSC inducible lines for endothelial cell differentiation. The human Rosa26 locus on chromosome 3 was selected to allow the expression of rtTET, while minimizing the chromosome location-dependent silencing effect. First, the LoxP recombination sites (LOX71 and LOX2272) were introduced into a site between exon 1 and exon 2 of the human ROSA 26 gene via homologous recombination. The targeting construct (KI construct) used the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter (PGK)-driven expression of diphtheria toxin A fragment gene (DTA) for negative selection, and contains a \u223c 2.0 kb 5' arm and a 4.5 kb 3' arm. A splicing acceptor signal from human BCL2 gene (SA) was placed in front of LOX71 site to allow the expression of selection markers from the endogenous human ROSA26 promoter. The coding region for thymidine kinase (TK) was included to enable negative selection against incorrect Cre/LoxP recombination events at step 2 using ganciclovir. The neomycin phosphotransferase (Neo) was used for positive selection during homologous recombination (step 1). The foot-and-mouth disease virus peptide (2A) was used to co-express the TK and Neo genes from the endogenous human ROSA26 promoter. BGHpA: polyadenylation signal derived from bovine growth hormone gene. The homologous recombination yielded parental human ESC/iPSC lines for efficient cassette exchange via Cre/LoxP recombination. To establish inducible cell lines for EC differentiation, rtTET driven by the constitutively active eukaryotic elongation factor 1\u03b1 promoter (pEF) was introduced into the Rosa 26 locus by lipid-mediated cotransfection of the recombination mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) vector and a Cre-expressing plasmid. The puromycin N-acetyl-transferase (Puro) was used to select for recombination events. The correctly recombined inducible cells are resistant to puromycin (Puro+) and ganciclovir (TK-), and sensitive to genetici",
    "uman ESC/iPSCs are shown in FIG. 1. Human ESCs mentioned in this example are for reference only. Endothelial cells can likely be efficiently induced from human ESC/iPSCs via expression of an appropriate transgene or transgene combination (top box), bypassing most, if not all, developmental stages required during normal differentiation (bottom box).</p>The strategy employed for identifying transgenes that could directly convert human ESC/iPSCs to mature endothelial cells (FIG. 2). Human ESC/iPSCs were engineered to constitutively express rtTET protein for inducible gene expression. Transgenes under the control of the inducible promoter Ptight were introduced into the engineered hESC/iPSCs by electroporation. Upon doxycycline (Dox) addition, transgene expression is induced, and EC differentiation is monitored by the characteristic EC morphology along with expression of definitive EC markers (e.g., CD31, CD144 (VE-cadherin)) by flow cytometry. Endothelial cells thus programmed are purified for in vitro and in vivo functional assays.</p>The establishment of human ESC/iPSC inducible (R/I) lines for endothelial cell differentiation (FIG. 3).
