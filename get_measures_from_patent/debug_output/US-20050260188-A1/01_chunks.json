    "Preparation of CMC-N Cross-Linked Particles  CMC-N, 3.0 g dissolved in 15.0 ml D.I. water. To the solution added with 0.1 g of disuccinimidyl suberate in 2.0 ml dimethyl sulfoxide (DSS/DMSO) under vigorous stirring. Precipitates appeared shortly after mixing. The reaction was carried out under stirring for 6 h, then standing on bench for 24 h. The supernatant was discarded and the solid was washed for three times with large volume of D. I. Water. CMC-N particles cross-linked with DSS thus formed is stable in water, saline, and tissue culture medium. </p> II. Hemostatic Derivatized CMC/PEO Composites </p> Derivatized CMCs of this invention can be very desirable as hemostatic agents. CMC/PEO composites can be manufactured as described above and used as is, or can have hemostatic factors incorporated therein. In certain embodiments, thrombin can be advantageously incorporated into hemostatic products to slow aggressive bleeding and promote clot formation. </p>Example 9 Modification of CMC with Ethylenediamine  Materials: </p> Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) having an average molecular weight of 250 kdaltons (kdal) and the degree of substitution of 1.19 was obtained from Hercules Inc. (Wilmington, Del.). 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC), ethylenediamine dihydrochloride (EDA), activated partial thromboplastin time reagent (APTT), and thrombin were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, Mo.). Polyethylene glycol derivative, methoxy-PEO-SPA (mPEO-SPA, M.W. 5 kD) was obtained from Shearwater Polymers (Huntsville, Ala.). Fresh porcine skin was from a local market. </p> Citrated bovine blood was prepared by mixing one part of sodium citrate solution with nine parts of whole blood from a healthy adult bull (courtesy of Dr. William Plummer of the Animal Science Department, California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, Calif.). </p> Polymer Modification: </p> A. Modification of CMC with Ethylenediamine </p> Introduction of primary amine groups into CMC was conducted according to published methods (Liu, 1991). Briefly, to a CMC solution, 0.30 ml of a solution of MES buffer, pH 4.7, was added with EDC (0.29 gm) in 2.0 ml MES, under constant stirring. The reaction solution was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes, followed be the addition of EDA (3.0 gm) in 8.o ml MES buffer. After 48 hours, the reaction solution was transferred into a dialysis membrane tube (Spectro/Por\u00ae, M.W. cutoff: 12,000-14,000 daltons) and was dialyzed against 1 N NaCl (4.0 L) for 16 hours, then against a large volume of running de-ionized (DI) water for an additional 24 hours. The dialyzed solution was lyophilized to obtain a dry preparation of CMC derivative and was processed for the quantification of introduced primary amines to form aminated CMC (CMC-N). The dry product thus formed was stored in a dessicator at 4\u00b0 C. for the following experiments. </p>Example 10 Conjugation of CMC-N with mPEO-SPA  PEO was grafted onto the side chains of CMC-N b"
