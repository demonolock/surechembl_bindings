    " dose per gram brain accumulate. FIG. 4 illustrates the biodistribution of radiolabeled cromolyn Compound A following intravenous injection in mice. In FIG. 4, a 5, 30 or 60 minute, corresponding to Series 1, 2 or 3, respectively in the graph, brain uptake shows 1% accumulation with little or no washout for the period measured.</p>5. The binding of cromolyn to A\u03b2 and its polymerization inhibition was confirmed by four independent methods.</p>UV Aggregation Assay.</p>A\u03b2 peptide aggregation and the impact of drugs to slow or prevent A\u03b2 aggregation was measured by a UV absorbance assay (Findeis, 1999). A\u03b2 (1-40) peptides, at 50 \u03bcM, were mixed with 50 \u03bcM drug in assay buffer and the plate was incubated at ambient temperature on a plate reader. The UV absorbance was monitored at 540 nm over a 2-3 h period.</p>Polymerization of A\u03b2-monomer peptides into clusters of trimers and tetramers initiates the A\u03b2 aggregation process into protofibrils and then into fibrils that form amyloid plaques. The polymerization experiments revealed that A\u03b2 monomer reached 50% polymerization in 14 minutes. At equimolar concentrations with A\u03b2, the addition of cromolyn inhibited the rate of A\u03b2 polymerization 7-fold, namely 50% polymerization required 75 minutes incubation, compared to 14 minutes in the absence of drug.</p>TABLE 5Cromolyn inhibits A\u03b2 polymerization.Relative Increase in% Thioflavin TPolymerizationTest CompoundBoundRelative BindingTime (fold)Vehicle37%11TS734 (cromolyn)30%0.827.8</p>LC/MS/MS Binding Assay.</p>Binding was measured by equilibrium dialysis. Amyloid fibrils were preformed by incubating the peptide in buffer with shaking for 120 hours at 27\u00b0 C. The drugs were incubated with fibrils (50 \u03bcM peptide) in a RED equilibrium dialysis device (Pierce), and the amount of test agent on each side is determined by LC/MS/MS. Percent bound was calculated as 1\u2212(free conc/total conc) after correcting for background signal. Thioflavin-T was used as a positive control. Binding is displacement of Thioflavin T. Polymerization is ranked for relative A\u03b2. In general, compounds that rank highly in inhibiting polymerization rank low in binding to aggregates, and vice versa.</p>Competition Binding Assay.</p>The competition assay was performed as described previously (Ono and Hayashi, 2009). Amyloid peptide aggregates were preformed by incubating A\u03b2 (1-40) peptide with buffer for 3 days at 37\u00b0 C. Drugs at 20 \u03bcM were mixed with assay solution containing 10 \u03bcg/mL amyloid peptide aggregates+3 \u03bcM Thioflavin-T on one side of a RED dialysis device with assay buffer added to the other side. After 4 h dialysis, the amount of Thioflavin-T was determined by LC/MS/MS. The relative binding was determined by normalizing the percent binding by the percent binding of the vehicle control.</p>A\u03b2 Aggregation by Thioflavin T Assay.</p>One of the most routinely used approaches to monitor A\u03b2 polymerization is the thioflavin T binding assay. When thioflavin T binds to beta-sheet rich structures, such as amyloid aggregates, the dye displays enhanced fluorescence and a characteristic red shift in its emission spectrum. A\u03b2 peptide at 5 \u03bcM was mixed with 10 \u03bcM thioflavin T with drug at different concentrations. In the absence of drug, A\u03b2 polymerization shows increasing thioflavin T fluorescence over 60-180 min, as shown in FIG. 4.</p>The addition of cromolyn (CO399) and its <sup>18</sup>F derivative (TS734) at nanomolar concentration shows inhibition of A\u03b2 aggregation, as shown in FIG. 5.</p>By four separate in vitro assays, cromolyn sodium, at nanomolar concentrations, effectively inhibits A\u03b2 amyloid peptide polymerization into oligomers and higher order aggregates.</p>6. Preliminary analysis of the binding model indicates that cromolyn binding to the surface of beta sheet across the beta strand in a manner similar to Thioflavin-T. FIGS. 6 and 7 illustrate the side and top view of the relative structures and locations of cromolyn and A\u03b2 after cromolyn binds A\u03b2 through a binding model simulation.</p>7. Applicants tested several other structures for treating AD in addition to cromolyn. Several types of compounds for both imaging and therapeutic agents have been evaluated for A\u03b2 peptide polymerization inhibition.</p>In an effort to combine bioavailability and dual function, Applicants have tethered scyllo-inositol, which is transported across the blood-brain barrier and known to bind and neutralize oligo"
