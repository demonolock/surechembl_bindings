Pharm. 39: 9-12; 1991. Membrane enriched fractions from rat brain minus cerebellum (ABS Inc., Wilmington, Del.) were slowly thawed at 4\u00b0 C., washed and resuspended in 30 volumes of BSS-Tris buffer (120 mM NaCl/5 mM KCl/2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>/2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>/50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 4 \u00b0 C.). Samples containing 100-200 \u03bcg of protein and 0.75 nM [<sup>3</sup>H]-cytisine (30 C<sub>i</sub>/mmol; Perkin Elmer/NEN Life Science Products, Boston, Mass.) were incubated in a final volume of 500 \u03bcL for 75 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. Seven log-dilution concentrations of each compound were tested in duplicate. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 10 \u03bcM (\u2212)-nicotine. Bound radioactivity was isolated by vacuum filtration onto prewetted glass fiber filter plates (Millipore, Bedford, Mass.) using a 96-well filtration apparatus (Packard Instruments, Meriden, Conn.) and were then rapidly rinsed with 2 mL of ice-cold BSS buffer (120 mM NaCl/5 mM KCl/2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>/2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>). Packard MicroScint-20\u00ae scintillation cocktail (40 \u03bcL) was added to each well and radioactivity determined using a Packard TopCount\u00ae instrument.

    "fractions from rat brain minus cerebellum or human cortex (ABS Inc., Wilmington, Del.). Pellets were thawed at 4\u00b0 C., washed and resuspended with a Polytron at a setting of 7 in 30 volumes of BSS-Tris buffer (120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 4\u00b0 C.). Seven log-dilution concentrations of test compounds containing 100-200 \u03bcg of protein, and 0.5 nM [<sup>3</sup>H]-DPPB (62.8 Ci/mmol; R46V, Abbott Labs) were incubated in a final volume of 500 \u03bcl for 75 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. in duplicate. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 10 \u03bcM methyllycaconitine. Bound radioactivity was collected on Millipore MultiScreen\u00ae harvest plates FB presoaked with 0.3% PEI using a Packard cell harvester, washed with 2.5 ml ice-cold buffer, and radioactivity was determined using a Packard TopCount Microplate beta counter. IC<sub>50 </sub>values were determined by nonlinear regression in Microsoft\u00ae Excel or Assay Explorer. K<sub>i </sub>values were calculated from the IC<sub>50</sub>s using the Cheng-Prusoff equation, where K<sub>i</sub>=IC<sub>50</sub>/(1+[Ligand]/K<sub>D</sub>).

The dark mixture was cooled to room temperature, and the resulting precipitate was isolated by filtration, washed with toluene (15 mL) and dried under vacuum to provide the title compound as an off-white solid (3.00 g). The filtrate was concentrated and the residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel, eluting with ethyl acetate, to provide additional product (0.41 g, total yield 3.41 g, 56%): MS (DCI/NH<sub>3</sub>) m/z 353 (M+H)<sup>+</sup>. </p>Step 2: Preparation of (S,S)-2-Methyl 5-(6-phenyl-pyridazin-3-yl)-2,5-diaza-bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane  The product obtained from Step 1 (3.41 g, 9.7 mmol) was dissolved in formic acid (20 mL) and treated with formalin (37% by weight, 1.0 g, 12.3 mmol). The mixture was heated at 100\u00b0 C. for 1 h, and the brown solution was cooled to room temperature and concentrated under vacuum.
