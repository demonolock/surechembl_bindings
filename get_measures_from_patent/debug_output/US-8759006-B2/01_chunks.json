AAV vectors have several advantage for human gene therapy. For example, they are trophic for human cells but can also infect other mammalian cells; (2) no disease has been associated with AAV in humans or other animals; (3) integrated AAV genomes appear stable in their host cells; (4) there is no evidence that integration of AAV alters expression of host genes or promoters or promotes their rearrangement; (5) introduce genes can be rescued from the host cell by infection with a helper virus such as adenovirus.</p>HSV-1 vector system facilitates introduction of virtually any gene into non-mitotic cells (Geller et al. an efficient deletion mutant packaging system for a defective herpes simplex virus vectors: Potential applications to human gene therapy and neuronal physiology.

    "/ml of purified anti-PSCA antibody and a 1:500 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, Pa.). Data was acquired on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson) and analyzed using LYSIS II software. Control samples were stained with secondary antibody alone. Glycosylphosphatidyl inositol linkage was analyzed by digestion of 2\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>cells with 0.5 units of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC, Boehringer Mannheim) for 90 min at 37\u00b0 C. Cells were analyzed prior to and after digestion by either FACS scanning or immunoblotting.</p>Results</p>PSCA is a GPI-Anchored Glycoprotein Expressed on the Cell Surface: The deduced PSCA amino acid sequence predicts that PSCA is heavily glycosylated and anchored to the cell surface through a GPI mechanism. In order to test these predictions, we produced an affinity purified polyclonal antibody raised against a unique PSCA peptide (see Materials and Methods). This peptide contains no glycosylation sites and was predicted, based on comparison to the three dimensional structure of CD59 (another GPI-anchored PSCA homologue), to lie in an exposed portion of the mature protein (Kiefer et al., 1994, Biochem. 33: 4471-4482). Recognition of PSCA by the affinity-purified antibody was demonstrated by immunoblot and immunoprecipitation analysis of extracts of 293T cells transfected with PSCA and a GST-PSCA fusion protein. The polyclonal antibody immunoprecipitates predominantly a 24 kd band from PSCA-transfected, but not mock-transfected cells (FIG. 12A). Three smaller bands are also present, the smallest being \u02dc10 kd. The immunoprecipitate was treated with N and O specific glycosidases in order to determine if these bands represented glycosylated forms of PSCA. N-glycosidase F deglycosylated PSCA, whereas O-glycosidase had no effect (FIG. 12A). Some GPI-anchored proteins are known to have both membrane-bound and secreted forms (Fritz and Lowe, 1996, Am. J. Physiol. 270: G176-G183). FIG. 12B indicates that some PSCA is secreted in the 293T-overexpressing system. The secreted form of PSCA migrates at a lower molecular weight than the cell surface-associated form, perhaps reflecting the absence of the covalent GPI-linkage. This result may reflect the high level of expression in the 293T cell line and needs to be confirmed in prostate cancer cell lines and in vivo.</p>Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis was used to localize PSCA expression to the cell surface. Nonpermeabilized mock-transfected 293T cells, PSCA-expressing 293T cells and LAPC-4 cells were stained with affinity purified antibody or secondary antibody alone. FIG. 12C shows cell surface expression of PSCA in PSCA-transfected 293T and LAPC-4 cells, but not in mock-transfected cells. To confirm that this cell surface expression is mediated by a covalent GPI-linkage, cells were treated with GPI-specific phospholipase C (PLC). Release of PSCA from the cell surface by PLC was indicated by a greater than one log reduction in fluorescence intensity. Recovery of PSCA in post digest conditioned medium was also confirmed ",
    "d irrelevant antibody. Primary biopsy specimens were available for three patients with bone metastases. To approximate conditions of decalcification, slides from these specimens were treated for 20 min. in Decal-Stat (Lengers, N.Y.) prior to staining with PSCA mAbs.</p>Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were raised against a PSCA-GST fusion protein lacking both the amino and carboxyl terminal signal sequences of PSCA. Positive fusions were selected by ELISA using the PSCA-GST fusion protein and GST alone. Out of 400 hybridomas screened, 28 recognized the PSCA-GST fusion but not GST alone. These fusions were screened secondarily by flow cytometry of nonpermeabilized 293T cells transfected with PSCA and mock transfected 293T cells. Secondary screening by FACS was done in order to select clones capable of recognizing PSCA on the cell surface, hypothesizing that these might later become useful for in vivo targeting applications. Seven positive fusions were identified in this manner (mAbs 2A2, 3G3, 4A10, 1G8, 3E6, 3C5 and 2H9), of which five (mAbs 4A10, 1G8, 3E6, 3C5 and 2H9) were subcloned and purified.</p>The mAbs were tested for their ability to immunoprecipitate PSCA and/or to recognize PSCA on immunoblots. All mAbs were able to immunoprecipitate PSCA from 293T-PSCA cells, as well as from LAPC-9 prostate cancer xenograft tumors that express high levels of endogenous PSCA (FIG. 37). Likewise, all mAbs detected PSCA by immunoblotting, although mAbs 2H9 and 3E6 recognized only the \u02dc12 kd deglycosylated form of PSCA (FIG. 34).</p>The location on PSCA of the epitopes recognized by the five mAbs was determined by immunoblot analysis using three truncated PSCA-GST fusions proteins. mAbs 4A10, 2H9 and 3C5 recognize an epitope residing within the amino-terminal portion of PSCA (i.e., amino acids 21-50); mAb 1G8 recognizes an epitope within the middle region of PSCA (i.e., amino acids 46-85); and mAb 3E6 reacts within the carboxyl-terminal portion of PSCA (amino acids 85-99) (FIG. 15). All five mAbs are IgG as described in FIG. 15. These results demonstrate that the five mAbs can detect PSCA in multiple assays and recognize at least three distinct epitopes on PSCA.</p>PSCA mAbs Stain the Cell Surface of Prostate Cancer Cells</p>The utility of mAbs for studying PSCA biology and for potential clinical applications such as in vivo targeting applications is dependent on their ability to recognize the antigen of interest on the plasma membrane (Liu, H. et al., 1997; McLaughlin, P. et al., 1998; Wu, Y. et al., 1995; Tokuda, Y. et al., 1996). In order to determine the ability of mAbs 2H9, 3E6, 1G8, 4A10 and C5 to recognize PSCA specifically on the cell surface of prostate cancer cells, LNCaP cells transfected with PSCA (LNCaP-PSCA) and LAPC-9 cells were examined by flow cytometry and indirect immunofluorescence. As with 293T-PSCA cells, all five mAbs were able to detect PSCA on the cell surface of nonpermeabilized LNCaP-PSCA and/or LAPC-9 cells by flow cytometry (FIG. 3"
