    " of Wnt signaling. Thus, the activator of Wnt signaling can be a GSK3P inhibitor. A GSK3P inhibitor is capable of activating a WNT signaling pathway, see e.g., Cadigan, et al., J Cell Sci. 2006; 119:395-402; Kikuchi, et al., Cell Signalling. 2007; 19:659-671, which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties. As used herein, the term \"glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 inhibitor\" refers to a compound that inhibits a glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 enzyme, for example, see, Doble, et al., J Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1175-1186, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. </p> Non-limiting examples of activators of Wnt signaling or GSK3P inhibitors are disclosed in WO2011/149762, Chambers (2012), and Calder et al., J Neurosci. 2015 Aug 19;35(33): 11462-81, which are incorporated by reference in their entireties. In certain embodiments, the one or more activator of Wnt signaling is a small molecule selected \n\n from the group consisting of CHIR99021, WNT3A, derivatives thereof, and mixtures thereof. </p> In certain embodiments, the Wnt activator is CHIR99021. \"CHIR99021\" (also known as or \"aminopyrimidine\" or </p>\"3-[3-(2-Carboxyethyl)-4-methylpyrrol-2-methylidenyl]-2-indolinone\") refers to IUPAC name 6-(2-(4-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-5-(4-methyl-lH-imidazol-2-yl)pyrimidin-2-ylamino) ethylamino)nicotinonitrile with the following formula. </p></p>CHIR99021 is highly selective, showing nearly thousand-fold selectivity against a panel of related and unrelated kinases, with an IC50=6.7 nM against human GSK3P and nanomolar IC50 values against rodent GSK3P homologs. </p> The stem cells can be contacted with the one or more activator of Wnt signaling for at least about 4 days, at least about 5 days, at least about 6 days, at least about 7 days, at least about 8 days, at least about 9 days, at least about 10 days, at least about 11 days, at least about 12 days, at least about 13 days, at least about 14 days, at least about 15 days, at least about 16 days, at least about 17 days, at least about 18 days, at least about 19 days, at least about 20 days, at least about 21 days, at least about 22 days, at least about 23 days, at least about 24 days, at least about 25 days, at least about 26 days, at least about 27 days, at least about 28 days, or at least about 29 days, at least about 30 days, to produce a population of cells expressing one or more enteric neural crest lineage marker (ENS precursors). In certain embodiments, the stem cells are contacted with the one or more activator of Wnt signaling for up to about 4 days, up to about 5 days, up to about 6 days, up to about 7 days, up to about 8 days, up to about 9 days, up to about 10 days, up to about 1 1 days, up to about 12 days, up to about 13 days, up to about 14 days, up to about 15 days, up to about 16 days, up to about 17 days, up to about 18 days, up to about 19 days, up to about 20 days, up to about 21 days, up to about 22 days, up to about 23 days, up to about 24 days, up to about 25 days, up to about 26 days, up to about 27 days, up to abo"
