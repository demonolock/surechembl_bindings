    "e elements (e.g., polypeptide sequences or polynucleotide sequences) that allows them to operate in their intended manner. For example, an operable linkage between a polynucleotide of interest and a regulatory sequence (such as, for example, a promoter) is a functional linkage that enables expression of the polynucleotide of interest. In this sense, the term \"operably linked\" refers to the positioning of a regulatory region and a coding sequence to be transcribed such that the regulatory region effectively regulates the transcription or translation of the coding sequence of interest. Thus, a promoter is operably linked to a nucleic acid sequence if it can mediate the transcription of the nucleic acid sequence. It should be understood that the operatively connected elements may be continuous or discontinuous. In the context of polypeptides, \"operably linked\" refers to a physical linkage (e.g., direct or indirect connection) between amino acid sequences (e.g., different segments, modules, or domains) to provide the described activity of the polypeptide.</p>As used herein, the term \"binding affinity\" refers to the \"strength\" of binding of a given molecule (such as, for example, a non-naturally occurring IL-12 variant, homodimeric IL-12Fc fusion protein, and/or heterodimeric IL-12Fc fusion protein) to its ligand (such as, for example, IL-12r\u03b22) and/or the rate at which the molecule associates and/or dissociates with its ligand.

EXAMPLE 9 in vitro modulation of T cell phenotype by IL-12 Fc Ala mutants</p>The effect of IL-12 Fc variants exhibiting a range of reduced potency on T cell phenotype in vitro was subsequently studied. To expand/activate human T cells, peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) from three independent healthy donors were cultured for 2 days in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fcs, 2mM L-alanyl-L-glutamine dipeptide, 50U/mL penicillin, 50ug/mL streptomycin, 55 \u03bc\u039c \u03b2 -mercaptoethanol, 10mM HEPES, 0.1mM non-essential amino acids, 1mM sodium pyruvate, 600U/mL IL-2 and 30ng/mL OKT3, then washed and resuspended in the same medium with the above characteristics, except that the medium was devoid of OKT3 and contained 50U/mL IL-2 and each of 1, 5 or 10ng/mL wild-type IL-12 Fc or 10ng/mL individual members of the \"alanine potency series\". After two days, T cells were stained with a surface marker panel comprising (i) anti-CD 4 (BUV 805), (ii) anti-CD 8 (BUV 737), (iii) anti-CD 39 (percpcy 5.5), (iv) anti-CD 45RO (BV 650), (v) anti-CD 45RA (BUV 395), (vi) anti-CD 62L (APC-Cy 7), (vii) anti-PD-1 (BV 785), (viii) anti-CD 27 (BV 711), (ix) anti-Tim 3 (BV 421), (x) anti-CD 95 (PE-Cy 7) and (xi) anti-LAG-3 (AF 647). Subsequently, T cells were fixed and permeabilized using FoxP3 transcription factor kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) and then stained with intracellular marker sets comprising (a) anti-TCF 1 (PE), (B) anti-Ki-67 (BV 605), (c) anti-FoxP 3 (AF 700) and (d) anti-granzyme B (APC), then analyzed using Cytek Aurora.</p>Figures 40-43 depict the expression of selected T cell markers on cd8+ and cd4+ T cells derived from two donors. Wild-type IL-12 Fc induces the expression of several T cell activation and depletion markers, including granzymes B, LAG-3, CD39, and to a lesser extent PD-1, in CD4+ and CD8+ cells, and is associated with a shift from naive to activated/memory phenotypes, represented by a decrease in the proportion of CD45RA+CD45RO-cells. The degree of induction of these markers varies between individual members of the \"alanine potency series\" and is directly related to potency, with \"higher potency\" variants inducing higher marker expression and \"lower potency\" variants inducing lower levels of marker expression. To more systematically analyze the relationship between T cell phenotype and IL-12 efficacy, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed in which the entire set of phenotypic markers in cd8+ and cd4+ T cells in 3 different PBMC donors (\"B245\", \"B246\" and \"B247\"; see, e.g., figures 44 and 45) was considered (described above). In CD8+ T cells, PC1 scores and IL-12 efficacy showed strong correlation, in which wild-type IL-12 and \"high potency\" variants induced a relatively higher score than \"low potency\" variants and samples cultured in the absence of IL-12 Fc. PC2 has the strongest correlation with IL-12 potency in cd4+ T cells, although not as consistent as ",

Ifn\u03b3 production was measured via the human ifn\u03b3 AlphaLISA detection kit. Figure 65 depicts an AlphaLISA count plot and figure 66 provides a summary of calculated EC50 values. Overall, each mutant tested exhibited weaker efficacy than WT IL-12 Fc, and the fold change in EC <sub>50</sub> values was directly related to the magnitude of the decrease in efficacy observed when mutants were tested at a single concentration (data depicted in figures 59 and 63), thus validating the initial method of screening for non-alanine mutants for efficacy.</p>M. thermal stability of example 13-IL-12 Fc mutant</p>To investigate whether alanine substitutions at positions 40, 126, 127, 129, 168 or 170 affected the stability of the IL-12 p35 subunit, differential Scanning Fluorescence (DSF) was performed using NanoTemper Prometheus nano DSF to measure heat-induced protein unfolding. Wild-type IL-12 Fc and IL-12 Fc containing individual alanine mutations at positions 40, 126, 127, 129, 168 or 170 are heated to 110\u2103at a rate of 1\u2103per minute in a buffer containing 20mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) and 150mM NaCl at a concentration of 0.2-0.4 mg/mL. FIG. 67 depicts data depicting the first derivative of the F350 to F330 ratio as a function of temperature. Wild-type IL-12 Fc was observed to undergo two different thermal unfolding events, the first (melting temperature (T <sub>M</sub>) of about 60 \u2103) potentially corresponding to the IL-12 subunit and the second (T <sub>M</sub> of about 80 \u2103) potentially corresponding to the Fc subunit.
