    "s, Figure-4C, some of which were reported to be highly potent B-Raf(V600E) inhibitors (Dietrich J., etal. Bioorg. Med. Chem. (2010), 18(1): 292-304). </p> This previous disclosure described computational experiments using lUWJ.pdb, the co- crystal structure of B-Raf(V600E) with Sorafenib, in which no attractive low-energy pose were produced during docking studies. This poor fit, thought to result from a steric clash between the inhibitor and Glutamate 500 in lUWJ.pdb, Figure-5A, prompted exploration of alternate binding modes. Thus, this report proposed an alternative mode of binding based on docking experiments using the DFG-out monomer-B co-crystal structure of B-Raf(V600E) with PLX-4720 (Tsai, 2008). By utilizing this co-crystal structure, 3C4C.pdb, the proposed negative steric interaction with glutamate 500 appeared to be removed, Figure-5B. </p> Figure-5 illustrates the binding mode of quinazolinone containing inhibitors with B-Raf. This publication also described the structure activity relationship within a small series of structurally related compound which all shared the quinazolinone HGM and imidazole scaffold. The only structural variations reported were limited to the 2- and 5- positions of an imidazole scaffold with the three compounds depicted in Figure-6 displayeing the most potent activity against B-Raf(V600E). The apparent time dependence reported was consistent with Type-II inhibition. The phosphor-protein gel assay used in this report revealed sub-nanomolar IC50 values for these three inhibitors when the inhibitor and enzyme were preincubated for 1 hour prior to addition of the MEK1 substrate. When evaluated against a panel of 96 kinases, Table- 10, all three compounds displayed potent and selective inhibition of B-Raf (V600E), B-Raf(Wt), C-RAF(Raf-l), PDGFR-oc, PDGFR-\u03b2, c-Kit, and p38-cc. \n\n</p></p> Table- 10: Summary of inhibition profiles for the imidazole quinazolinone inhibitors KIN-035, KIN-038, and KIN-057, (Dietrich, 2010).

This specific scaffold geometry is uniquely complementary to the DFG-out conformation of many kinases yet tightly anchors the inhibitor so that int",

Percent stereochemically purity by weight is the ratio of the weight of the geometric isomer over the weight of the both geometric isomers. For example, 99% stereochemically pure means that at least 99% by weight of the compound is the indicated stereoisomer. </p> A pharmaceutical composition of the compounds disclosed herein may, alternatively or in addition to a compound of the above formulae, comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of the above formulae, or a prodrug or pharmaceutically active metabolite of such a compound or salt and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers therefor. </p> \"Effective amount\" means that amount of active compound agent that elicits the desired biological response in a subject. Such response includes alleviation of the symptoms of the disease or disorder being treated. </p> \"Inhibiting kinase activity\" means to decrease the production of an phosphor-peptide by a particiluar kinase tha can be separated by analytical techniques. For example, a comprehensive \n\n platform of kinase, protease, phosphatase and epigenetic assays that utilizes cutting -edge microti uddics and informatics tools to provide accurate and rapid results. Profiling data in this application were determined using these techniques at Nanosyu inc. IC50 data were provided by Reaction Biology Inc using a P33 radiolabeled kinase assay. </p> \"Pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\" means compounds and compositions that are of sufficient purity and quality for use in the formulation of a composition of the present disclosure and that, when appropriately administered to an animal or human, do not produce an adverse reaction. </p> \"Treatment\" or \"treating\", as used herein, includes prophylactic and therapeutic treatment. \"Therapeutic treatment\" includes partially or totally inhibiting, delaying, or reducing the severity of the disease or disorder related to kinases. \"Prophylactic treatment\" encompasses administration of a compound of the invention to a subject susceptible to a disease or disorder related to the activity or expression of kinases in an effort to reduce the likelihood of a subject developing the disease or disorder, or slowing or preventing progression of the disease. </p>Prophylactic treatment includes suppression (partially or completely) of the disease or disorder, and further includes reducing the severity of the disease or disorder, if onset occurs. </p>Prophylactic treatment is particularly advantageous for administration to mammals at risk for developing a disease or disorder related to kinase activity. </p> The compounds disclosed herein can be prepared and administered in a wide variety of oral and parenteral dosage forms. Thus, the compounds of the present disclosure can be administered by injection, that",
    "profiling data for I-ll, 1-12, 1-14 and 1-15 assayed in duplicate against a panel of 220 kinases. Kinases listed in table were inhibited better than 50% at the profiling concentration of 5 \u03bc\u039c. </p> While I-ll remained extremely selective for p38-oc, 1-12 displayed greater that 50% inhibition for 45 of the panel kinases and 72 kinases at &gt; 25% inhibition. These data illustrate that, by modifying the HGM, both a wide range of kinases can be inhibited and high degrees of \n\n selectivity can be obtained. Inhibitors, 1-14 and 1-15 were also tested against this panel, Table - 22. These two inhibitors illustrate that attractive profiles can be obtained using a wider range of HGMs. </p> Because the inhibition profile of 1-14 included members of both the MAPK and PI3K pathways, IC<sub>50</sub> determinations were performed on the most significantly inhibited kinases with the inclusion of all the PI3K isoforms. These data, Table-23, which were intended to explore both potency and mechanism of inhibition, revealed the most significant time dependence with all the PI3K isoforms. The observation of potency and isoform selectivity with time-dependency for \u03a1\u03993\u039a-\u03b3 appears to be unprecedented in the literature. In addition, these activities combined with inhibition of p38-oc, Raf-1, DDR and CSF-1R, would be complimentary and potentially synergistic activities for both the treatment of certain inflammation based conditions and cancers. </p></p> Table-23: Determination of time dependence and IC50 values for 1-14 for selected kinases. Due to the low ATP concentration used (10 uM), the effects of preincubation may be attenuated for some kinases. </p> Based on the interesting activity data for 1-14 land 1-15, a small library of 20 analogs was prepared, ie. 10 new scaffolds coupled to the Imatinib and Sorafenib HGMs (HGM-1 and HGM- \n\n 17), to explore the effects of scaffold alterations on activity profiles, Table 24. A summary of these activity profiles compared to those of 1-14 and 1-15 is presented in Table 25.</p></p> T bl 24 C i f h d d ib f 20 hibi b d i hibi 114 \n\n\n\n </p>Table 25: Kinase Inhibition Profiles of the 20 new compounds defined in Table 13 against a panel of 230 kinaes when assayed at 5 uM.
