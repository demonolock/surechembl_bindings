    "CADM1 as highly HGSOC specific target. ANPEP another protease of interest. Another class that was surprising was Integrins, in particular ITGA3/B1. Interestingly we identified different anti-ITGA3/B1 antibodies, with distinct binding profiles. Expression analysis indicates high expression across all ovarian lines, our data indicates that ITGA3/B1 can be in different states in different ovarian cell lines (different conformation, or different modification); while a commercially available antibody didn't show any cell line specificity, it bound to recombinant ITGA3/B1, while neither of our ITGA/B3 antibody showed much binding in ELISAs despite clear specificity in cell based knockdown and overexpression experiments. Without wishing to be bound by theory, previously unrecognized forms of ITGA3/B1 could be attractive therapeutic targets. This is supported by the observation that several ovarian cancer cell lines are dependent on ITGA3/B1. Highlights the suitability of our approach to identify new therapeutic targets.</p>FIG. 8 shows (Panel A) Diagram showing Erbb2 gene expression plotted against Erbb2 dependency across all CCLE cell lines.

    " antibody to selectively recognize and specifically bind epitopes on antigens. For example, the VL domain and VH domain, or subset of the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), of an antibody combine to form the variable region that defines a three-dimensional antigen-binding site. This quaternary antibody structure forms the antigen-binding site present at the end of each arm of the Y. Epitopic determinants can consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and can have specific three-dimensional structural characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. For example, antibodies can be raised against N-terminal or C-terminal peptides of a polypeptide. More specifically, the antigen-binding site is defined by three CDRs on each of the VH and VL chains (i.e. CDR-H1, CDR-H2, CDR-H3, CDR-L1, CDR-L2 and CDR-L3).</p>In embodiments, an antibody described herein can be a \u201ctherapeutic candidate\u201d or a \u201cdiagnostic candidate\u201d. A candidate antibody, for example, can refer to an antibody which can or has the potential to provide an effect, such as a therapeutic effect of a diagnostic effect.</p>The terms \u201cimmunological binding,\u201d and \u201cimmunological binding properties\u201d can refer to the non-covalent interactions of the type which occur between an immunoglobulin molecule and an antigen for which the immunoglobulin is specific. The strength, or affinity of immunological binding interactions can be expressed in terms of the dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) of the interaction, wherein a smaller K<sub>d </sub>represents a greater affinity. Immunological binding properties of selected polypeptides can be quantified using methods well known in the art. One such method entails measuring the rates of antigen-binding site/antigen complex formation and dissociation, wherein those rates depend on the concentrations of the complex partners, the affinity of the interaction, and geometric parameters that equally influence the rate in both directions. Thus, both the \u201con rate constant\u201d (K<sub>on</sub>) and the \u201coff rate constant\u201d (K<sub>off</sub>) can be determined by calculation of the concentrations and the actual rates of association and dissociation. (See Nature 361:186-87 (1993)). The ratio of K<sub>off</sub>/K<sub>on </sub>allows the cancellation of all parameters not related to affinity, and is equal to the dissociation constant K<sub>d</sub>. (See, generally, Davies et al. (1990) Annual Rev Biochem 59:439-473).</p>An antibody of the invention can specifically bind to a target epitope when the equilibrium binding constant K<sub>d </sub>is less than about 100 nM. For example, the Kais less than about 90 nM, less than about 80 nM, less than about 70 nM, less than about 60 nM, less than about 50 nM, less than about 40 nM, less than about 30 nM, less than about 20 nM, less than about 10 nM, or less than about 5 nM. In embodiments, the Kais about 10-25 nM, about 25-50 nM, about 50-75 nM, or about 75-100 nM. In embodiments, the K<sub>d </sub>is about 1 nM, about 10 nM, about 20 nM, about 30 nM, about 40 nM, about 50 nM, about 60 nM, about 70 nM, about 80 nM, about 90 nM, about 100 nM, or greater than about 100 nM. Functionally, the binding affinity of the of the target antibody is from about 1 nM to about 50 nM.</p>Those skilled in the art will recognize that one can determine, without undue experimentation, if a human monoclonal antibody has the same specificity as a human monoclonal antibody of the invention by ascertaining whether the former prevents the latter from binding to a target epitope. For example, if the human monoclonal antibody being tested competes with the human monoclonal antibody of the invention, as shown by a decrease in binding by the human monoclonal antibody of the invention, then the two monoclonal antibodies can bind to the same, or to a closely related, epitope.</p>Another way to determine whether a human monoclonal antibody has the specificity of a human monoclonal antibody of the invention is to pre-incubate the human monoclonal antibody of the invention",
    "can be cultured in a suitable culture medium that contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, immortalized cells. For example, if the parental cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (\u201cHAT medium\u201d), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.</p>Immortalized cell lines that are useful are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level expression of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. For example, immortalized cell lines can be murine myeloma lines, which can be obtained, for instance, from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center (San Diego, California) and the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, Virginia). Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies. (See Kozbor, J. Immunol, 133:3001 (1984); Brodeur et al, Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, (1987) pp. 51-63)).</p>The culture medium in which the hybridoma cells are cultured can then be assayed for the presence of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. For example, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by the hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). Such techniques and assays are known in the art. The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson and Pollard, Anal. Biochem., 107:220 (1980). Moreover, in therapeutic applications of monoclonal antibodies, it is important to identify antibodies having a high degree of specificity and a high binding affinity for the target antigen.</p>After the desired hybridoma cells are identified, the clones can be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods. (See Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, Academic Press, (1986) pp. 59-103). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium and RPMI-1640 medium. Alternatively, the hybridoma cells can be grown in vivo as ascites in a mammal.</p>The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones can be isolated or purified from the culture medium or ascites fluid by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography.</p>Monoclonal antibodies can also be made by recombinant DNA methods, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567 (incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be readily isolated",
    "nium sulfate precipitation, ion exchange chromatorgraphy, immobilized protein resins, and immobilized metal chelate chromatography. For example, the immobilized protein resin contains immobilized protein A. As used herein, the term \u201cantigen-specifc purification\u201d can refer to a method that uses antibody binding to a specific antigen to separate the from those which do not bind the antigen.</p>Embodiments can further comprise producing (i.e., synthesize, manufacture, isolate) the one or more antibody candidates. Steps to produce an antibody are known in the art, see for example Basic Methods in Antibody Production and Characterization, eds. Gary C. Howard and Delia R. Bethell, CRC Press, 2000, which include but are not limited to cloning and synthesizing, reformatting, and expressing the antibody.</p>Embodiments can also comprise one or more amplification steps. The phrase \u201camplification step\u201d can refer to an exponential increase in a target nucleic acid. Non-limiting examples of methods of amplification include, but are not limited to PCR method (including RT-PCR method), NASBA (Nucleic Acid Sequence-Based Amplification) method, ICAN (Isothermal and Chimeric primer-initiated Amplification of Nucleic acids) method, LAMP (Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification) Method (including RT-LAMP method).</p>In embodiments, the binding specificity of the one or more antibody candidates can be validated. Non-limiting examples of such validation methods comprise an immunoassay, a live cell binding assay, high throughput cell line multiplexing through fluorescent barcoding, plate based binding assays, high content analysis, or any combination thereof.</p>For example, an \u201cimmunoassay\u201d can refer to a method of detection of a specific antigen or a group of related or similar antigens through their ability to be recognized and bond by a specific antibody directed against them. Non-limiting examples of immunoassays comprise comprises flow cytometry (e.g., fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), plate based fluorescence binding assays, high content analysis, immunohistochemistry/fluorescent imaging, western blotting.</p>Embodiments can further comprise identifying and/or validating the target of the antibody candidate. Methods of identification and/or validation will be known to the skilled artisan, non-limiting examples of which include antibody labeling, immunoprecipitation, antibody crosslinking, protein microarray, mass spectrometry (e.g., LC-MS/MS, MALDI-TOF MS, ESI, or label free analysis based on MS signal intensity), biotin transfer, or genetic approaches. For example, genetic approaches can comprise over expression library screens and genetic knockdown and/or knockout libraries. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the antibody can be expressed as a fusion protein to an enzyme that mediates labelling of proximity target proteins. For example, the proximity target proteins are secretases.</p>The term \u201cantibody ",
    "nding properties are then matched to their targets using a proteomic approach. The individual steps of the platform are summarized in FIG. 1.</p>As a representative example, we applied our platform to discover antibodies specific for binding to ovarian cancer cell lines with no binding to lymphocytes, and limited binding to fibroblasts and non-ovarian cancer cells. First, to deplete our VHH-bacteriophage display library of lymphocyte specific VHH, we performed a negative selection using primary PBMCs, followed by enrichment for ovarian cell specific binders using a pool of 6 ovarian cancer cell lines. After library amplification and an additional negative selection step the depleted library was subjected to biopanning against each ovarian line (positive cell lines), and each negative cell line (PBMCs, an immortalized fibroblast cell line, and a pancreatic cell line) individually. The output libraries were characterized by NGS, and following some quality control and normalization steps, individual CDR3s from each cell line were clustered based on homology and subjected to differential analysis (FIG. 2, Panel A).</p>Around 1100 sequences showed enrichment in at least one ovarian cell line over the negative samples (FIG. 2, Panel B). Of these we randomly selected 200 candidates for follow up binding analysis. Sequences were synthesized, fused to human IgG1-Fc, expressed in the Expi293 expression system before validating their predicted binding profiles in a FACS based multiplex binding assay. Of the 200 antibodies tested, only one showed binding to the negative Jurkat lymphocyte cell line, while 36 antibodies showed specific binding to at least one ovarian cell line, with a subset weakly also binding to fibroblasts and the pancreatic cell line (FIG. 2, Panel C). The remaining antibodies showed only weak or no binding to any cell line tested, a subset of which could be explained by low antibody expression. To further validate the selectivity of the specific binders to ovarian cell lines we tested their binding to a panel of pancreatic and fibroblast cell lines. As illustrated in FIG. 2, Panel C, most antibodies showed no or weak binding to most cell lines while some were less cell line specific.</p>We prioritized antibodies with weak or no cross reactivity to fibroblasts and pancreatic lines for follow up target identification. One cluster of 5 antibodies (highlighted as cluster A in FIG. 2 Panel C) showed particularly high specificity as it selectively bound to only one ovarian cancer cell line (SKOV3) (FIG. 3 Panel A). Comparison of their CDR3 regions confirmed that these antibodies were indeed distinct molecules (FIG. 3 Panel B). Using a biotin transfer based crosslinking approach, we identified the target of these antibodies as Her2 (FIG. 3 Panel C). CRISPRa induced expression of Her2 in OVCAR8 cells, a cell line the antibodies didn't bind to, resulted in strong antibody binding (FIG. 3 Panel D), while knockdown of Her2 in SKOV3 cells lead to los",
    "). After rigorous washing, phages were eluted by low pH treatment followed by bacterial amplification. The amplified output library was further depleted of unwanted VHHs by a second round of negative selection on PBMCs. Unbound phages were then subjected to biopanning against each ovarian line, and each negative cell line (PBMCs, an immortalized fibroblast cell line, and a pancreatic cell line) individually. The output libraries were characterized by massively parallel sequencing and compared against reported camelid V-gene and J-gene alleles in the IMGT/GENE-DB. We excluded sequences that were dissimilar to reported alleles or that showed alternations to the expected conserved amino acids. Extracted full-length VHH sequences were translated and clustered across cell lines based on the amino acid sequence similarity of the CDR3s. To select sequences that were specifically enriched in the cell lines of interest, we performed differential analysis between positive and negative cell lines across this set of CDR3 clusters (FIG. 2A).</p>1032 clusters showed enrichment in at least one ovarian cell line over the negative samples (FIG. 2B). For follow up binding analysis, we selected 200 sequences that were enriched in at least one HGSOC ovarian line or that showed high selectivity to one specific cell type. These sequences were synthesized, fused to human IgG1-Fc, expressed in the Expi293 expression system before validating their predicted binding profiles in a FACS based multiplex binding assay. Of the 200 antibody supernatants tested, only one showed binding to the negative Jurkat lymphocyte cell line (data not shown), while 36 antibodies showed specific binding to at least one ovarian cell line, with a subset weakly also binding to fibroblasts and a pancreatic cell line (FIG. 2C). The remaining antibodies exhibited only weak or absence of binding to any cell line tested, a subset of which could be explained by low antibody abundance in the supernatant as suggested by expression analysis of antibody supernatants by SDS-PAGE Coomassie staining (data not shown). To further evaluate the selectivity of the specific binders to ovarian cell lines, we tested binding to an additional panel of pancreatic and fibroblast cell lines. As summarized in FIG. 2C, the majority of antibodies showed binding to only a small subset of cell lines while a small subset bound to a much broader range of cell lines. Four clusters of antibodies shared similar binding patterns (clusters A-D highlighted in FIG. 2C), and other individual antibodies showed distinct binding profiles.</p>To identify the targets of these antibodies, we prioritized antibodies within the 4 clusters as well as ones with weak or no cross reactivity to fibroblasts. We used an in vivo biotin transfer based crosslinking approach (6). Specifically, we incubated an antibody labelled with a trifunctional aminooxy-sulfhydryl-biotin (ASB) crosslinker with oxidized live cells to induce formation of crosslinks with ",
