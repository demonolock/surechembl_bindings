    "o or more of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin uptake. The therapeutically effective inhibitory dose can be readily determined by those skilled in the art by using conventional range finding techniques and analogous results obtained in the test systems described above.</p>Compounds of this invention provide a particularly beneficial therapeutic index relative to other compounds available for the treatment of similar disorders. Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that this is due, at least in part, to the compounds having higher binding affinities for one or two of the neurotransmitter transporters, e.g., selectivity towards the serotonin transporter protein (\u201cSERT\u201d) over the transporters for other neurochemicals, e.g., the dopamine transporter protein (\u201cDAT\u201d) and the norepinephrine transporter protein (\u201cNET\u201d).</p>Binding affinities are demonstrated by a number of means well known to ordinarily skilled artisans, including, without limitation, those described in the Examples section below. Briefly, for example, protein-containing extracts from cells, e.g., HEK293E cells, expressing the transporter proteins are incubated with radiolabelled ligands for the proteins. The binding of the radioligands to the proteins is reversible in the presence of other protein ligands, e.g., the compounds of the present invention; said reversibility, as described below, provides a means of measuring the compounds' binding affinities for the proteins (IC<sub>50 </sub>or Ki). A higher IC<sub>50</sub>/Ki value for a compound is indicative that the compound has less binding affinity for a protein than is so for a compound with a lower IC<sub>50</sub>/Ki; conversely, lower IC<sub>50</sub>/Ki values are indicative of greater binding affinities.</p>Accordingly, the difference in compound selectivity for proteins is indicated by a lower IC<sub>50</sub>/Ki for the protein for which the compound is more selective, and a higher IC<sub>50</sub>/Ki for the protein for which the compound is less selective. Thus, the higher the ratio in IC<sub>50</sub>/Ki values of a compound for protein A over protein B, the greater is the compounds' selectivity for the latter over the former (the former having a higher IC<sub>50</sub>/Ki and the latter a lower IC<sub>50</sub>/Ki for that compound).</p>The compounds (\u201ctriple action transporter reuptake inhibitors\u201d) of the present invention have potent binding affinity simultaneously for all three of the biogenic amine transporters, NET, DAT, or SERT. For example, the compounds of this invention possess potent NET, DAT, &amp; SERT IC<sub>50</sub>/Ki values of less than 200 nM.</p>The in vivo affinity of the compounds to the three transporter proteins, SERT, DAT, and NET are demonstrated by means well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, including, without limitation, those described in the Examples section below.</p>Accordingly, the difference in compound selectivity in vivo for protein is indicated by a higher percent occupancy value (or percent inhibition of the [<sup>3</sup>H] ligand compound used in the Examples section) at the transporter protein for which the compound is more selective, and a lower percent occupancy (or percent inhibition of the <sup>3</sup>[H] ligand compound used in the Examples section) for the protein for which the compound is less selective.</p>The compounds of the present invention, when administrated at a pharmaceutically feasible dose via means such as, but not limited to, oral, intravenous, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal and intramuscular, have statistically significant percent occupancy value(s) at one, two or all of the biogenic amine transporters NET, DAT, or SERT.</p>The compounds of the present invention, when administrated at a pharmaceutically feasible dose via means such as, but not limited to, oral, intravenous, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal and intramuscular, have 10%-100% occupancy value(s) at one, two or all of the biogenic amine transporters NET, DAT, or SERT. In a preferred embodiment, compounds of the present invention have 40%-100% occupancy value(s) at at least o",

For mice and rats, after the brains were removed from the skull, the forebrain tissue (removal of the brainstem and cerebellum) was used for SERT, NET, and DAT occupancy assessment. In dogs, the striatum was dissected for DAT occupancy and the remaining forebrain tissue (without the striatum, brainstem, and cerebellum) was used for SERT and NET occupancy assessment. The brain tissues were frozen in chilled isopentane and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. until homogenization.</p>The brain tissues were thawed and then homogenized using a polytron homogenizer (Kinematica). Sample aliquots were frozen immediately and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C.

After incubation, the reactions were terminated by the addition of ice-cold assay buffer and rapid filtration through a Brandel Cell Harvester using FPXLR-196 filters. The filters were washed twice with ice-cold incubation buffer, punched into a clear plate prior to the addition of 200 ul scintillation fluid per well.
