If no special requirement is required during the gavage period, the gavage can be carried out conventionally.</p>2.3 sample Collection and Virus detection</p>After 15 days of gavage, mice were decapped and sacrificed, lung tissue was dissected away, and virus titer was determined.</p>2.4 detection of HE, Ki-67, Bcl-2</p>After the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, lung tissue was sectioned and examined by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) experiments.</p>Immunohistochemistry assay (IHC):</p>(1) dewaxing the cut slices: placing the slices in dimethylbenzene I and dimethylbenzene II for 5min respectively; placing the slices in anhydrous alcohol I, anhydrous alcohol II, 95% ethanol, 85% ethanol, 75% ethanol, 50% ethanol, and distilled water for 5min respectively;</p>(2) performing antigen retrieval for 2h by using an electric cooker, and naturally cooling;</p>(3) washing with PBS for 3 times, each for 2 min;</p>(4) dropwise adding 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10min to inactivate endogenous peroxidase;</p>(5) the subsequent steps were performed according to the Katy one-step immunohistochemical kit (purchased from Kyowa Katy Biotechnology Co., Ltd.).</p>HE staining:</p>(1) the steps of material taking, slicing, dewaxing and hydrating are the same as the steps (1) to (3) of the IHC experiment;</p>(2) placing the slices in hematoxylin staining jar, staining for 5min, and washing with clear water;</p>(3) placing the slices in an eosin dye vat, dyeing for 2min, and washing with clear water;</p>(4) removing excessive water, sequentially placing slices in 50% ethanol, 75% ethanol, 85% ethanol, 95% ethanol, anhydrous ethanol I and anhydrous ethanol II for 1min respectively;</p>(5) and (5) drying the gel in the air at room temperature, and sealing the gel with neutral resin.</p>2.5GFP fluorescence assay</p>(1) The steps of material taking, slicing, dewaxing and hydrating are the same as the steps (1) to (4) of the IHC experiment;</p>(2) tissue blocking for 1h, primary antibody incubation, 4 \u2103, overnight.</p>(3) Washing with PBS for 3 times, each for 2 min;</p>(4) incubating 488 fluorescent secondary antibody corresponding to the species for 1h, washing for 3 times with PBS (phosphate buffer solution), and washing for 2min each time;</p>(5) incubating DAPI for 15min, washing with PBS for 3 times, each for 2 min;</p>(6) and adding an anti-fluorescence quencher seal, fixing with nail polish, and photographing.</p>2.6 data processing</p>Data are averaged. + -. standard deviationShowing that SPSS 21.0 statistical software is used for carrying out statistical processing on data, and the statistical method adopts chi<sup>2</sup>Inspection when P is&lt;A score of 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>Third, experimental results</p>FIG. 3 shows GFP fluorescence experiments, and the results show that the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can effectively inhibit infection of the COVID-19 pseudovirus in lung tissue. It is also found through immunohistochemical experiments and HE staining that the pharmaceutical composition of the invention effectively inhibits the expression of cell proliferation index Ki-67 and apoptosis index Bcl-2 as shown in FIG. 4. FIG. 5 shows the result of the virus titer detection in the lung tissue of a mouse animal model, and it can be found that the concentration of COVID-19 pseudovirus in the lung tissue can be effectively reduced after the treatment by the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention.</p>The above description is only a preferred embodiment of the present application and is not intended to limit the present application, and various modifications and changes may be made by those skilled in the art.
