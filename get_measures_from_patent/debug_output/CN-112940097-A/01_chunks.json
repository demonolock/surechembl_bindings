    "e cells with PBS for 2 times, and adding appropriate amount of pancreatin for digestion for 2 min. (2) Removing pancreatin, adding appropriate amount of cell culture medium, blowing to remove cells, and regulating cell density to 2 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup>Per/mL, 100. mu.L per well were added to a 96-well plate. (3) After 24h, old medium was aspirated off and proteins diluted to 2.09, 4.19, 6.28 and 8.37 \u03bc M in cell culture medium were added, 180 \u03bc L per well, and blank control was replaced with fresh medium, respectively. (4) After 24h of protein action, 20. mu.L of MTT solution (final concentration 0.5mg/mL) was added to each well. (5) After 4h, the 96-well plate was carefully aspirated, 150. mu.L of DMSO was added to dissolve formazan deposited in the 96-well plate, the solution was placed on a shaker, shaken for 15min, and then placedDetermination of OD under enzyme-labeled Instrument<sub>490nm</sub>The value is obtained.</p>As can be seen from FIG. 2A, the 3 Survivin multi-point mutant proteins (TmSm34/48, TmSm34/84 and TmSm34/48/84) have a greater ability to inhibit the proliferation of A549 cells than the 3 Survivin single-point mutant proteins (TmSm34, TmSm48 and TmSm 84). When the concentration of the protein drug is 8.37 mu M, the inhibition rates of the 3 Survivin multi-point mutant proteins on the proliferation of A549 cells respectively reach 60.76%, 71.06% and 62.71%, which are higher than that of the 3 Survivin single-point mutant proteins (50.23%, 42.45% and 47.75%). Half maximal Inhibitory Concentration (IC) of cells was determined using SPSS software<sub>50</sub>) Referring to FIG. 2B, it can be seen that 3 Survivin multi-point mutant proteins act on the IC of A549 cells<sub>50</sub>Less than 3 Survivin single point mutant proteins.</p>Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining for detecting apoptosis: (1) regulating A549 cell density to 2 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup>2mL of each well was added to a 6-well plate. (2) After 24h, old medium was aspirated and protein diluted to 4.19 and 8.37 \u03bc M using cell culture medium was added, 2mL per well, and only fresh medium was replaced in the blank control group. (3) After 24h of protein exposure, cells were harvested and washed 2 times with PBS. (4) Adding 200 mu L of binding buffer solution in an Annexin V-FITC/PI double-staining kit, gently blowing and beating the cells to disperse the cells into single cells, respectively adding 5 mu L of Annexin V-FITC and PI, and incubating at 4 \u2103 in a dark place for 20min to obtain the product for on-machine detection.</p>As can be seen from fig. 3, all 6 Survivin mutant proteins induced apoptosis of a549 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Wherein, the capability of inducing A549 cell apoptosis of the 3 Survivin multi-point mutant proteins is stronger than that of the 3 Survivin single-point mutant proteins. When the protein concentration is 8.37 mu M, the A549 cell apoptosis rates caused by the 3 Survivin multi-point mutant proteins respectively reach 60.30%, 73.50% a"
