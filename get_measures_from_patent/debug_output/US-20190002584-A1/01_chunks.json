    "CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONSThis application claims the benefit of the filing date of U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/194,957 filed Jul. 21, 2015, U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/273,657, filed Dec. 31, 2015, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/316,310, filed Mar. 31, 2016. The entire contents of each of these referenced applications are incorporated by reference herein.</p>BACKGROUND OF INVENTIONFactor XII (FXII) is a component of the plasma contact activation system responsible for both the initiation of intrinsic coagulation and the conversion of pre-kallikrein into plasma kallikrein (pKal). Active pKal cleaves high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) to release bradykinin which is a potent activator of edema and pain. Activation of the intrinsic pathway for blood coagulation leads to the generation of fibrin and formation of blood clots (thrombus).</p>SUMMARY OF INVENTIONThe present disclosure is based on the identification of a number of antibodies that specifically bind Factor XIIa (FXIIa) but not Factor XII (FXII). These antibodies have high binding affinity to FXIIa (e.g., Ki<sup>app</sup>&lt;50 pM); successfully reduced the activation of plasma kallikrein; and delayed activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) but had no effect on prothrombin time (PT).</p>Accordingly, one aspect of the present disclosure features a monoclonal antibody that binds to Factor XIIa (FXIIa) and does not bind to Factor XII (FXII). In some embodiments, the antibody is a full length antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof, such as an Fab. In some embodiments, the antibody is a human antibody or a humanized antibody.</p>In some embodiments, the antibody interacts with one or more amino acid residues in chain C of FXIIa. In some examples, the amino acid residues are selected from L390, Y391, W392, G393, H394, S395, F396, C397, H412, C413, L414, Q415, D416, R432, N433, V456, Y458, H507, F509, E510, G511, A512, E513, Y515, D557, A558, C559, Q560, G561, D562, S563, I584, S585, W586, G587, S588, G589, C590, G591, D592, and G597 in SEQ ID NO: 128. In some embodiments, the antibody binds to a fragment of FXIIa comprising residues 390-397, 412-416, 432-433, 456-458, 507-515, 557-563 or 584-592 of SEQ ID NO: 128.</p>In some examples, the anti-FXIIa antibodies described herein comprises (a) a heavy chain comprising a heavy chain variable region that comprises a heavy chain complementarity determining region 1 (CDR1), a heavy chain complementarity determining region 2 (CDR2), and a heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3), and optionally (b) a light chain",
    " cells, yeast cells, insect cells, plant cells, and mammalian cells such as CHO cells.</p>Further, the present disclosure provides a method of producing any of the anti-FXIIa antibodies described herein. The method comprises culturing a host cell or host cell set that comprises a vector or vector set, which collectively encodes the antibody, and collecting the cultured cells or the culture medium for isolation of the antibody. Such a method can further comprise isolating the antibody from the cultured cells or the culture medium.</p>In another aspect, the present disclosure provides a method for treating a disease associated with Factor XII, e.g., diseases associated contact system activation, diseases associated with the pKal signaling pathway such as hereditary angioedema or HAE, or ocular diseases (e.g., macular edema, diabetic retinopathy, hypertensive retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, or retinal vein occlusion) in a subject. Such methods may comprise administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a composition comprising an antibody that binds to FXIIa and may not bind to FXII (e.g., any of the anti-FXIIa antibodies described herein), one or more nucleic acids that, collectively encode the antibody, or expression vectors comprising such nucleic acid(s). In some embodiments, the antibody specifically binds the catalytic domain of FXIIa. In other embodiments, the antibody inhibits the activation of FXI to FXIa. In yet other embodiments, the Ki<sup>app </sup>of the antibody is lower than about 110 pM (e.g., lower than about 50 pM or 10 pM).</p>The subject to be treated by the method described herein may be a human subject having, suspected of having, or at risk for the pKal-associated disease (e.g., HAE). In some examples, the subject has, is suspected of having, or is at risk for Type I, Type II, or Type III HAE.</p>In some embodiments, the subject to be treated by the methods described herein may be a human subject having, suspected of having, or at risk for a disease associated with Factor XII such as those disclosed herein (e.g., a disease associated with contact system activation). For example, the subject may have, suspected of have, or at risk for a disease associated with contact system activation, such as thrombosis, including thrombosis associated with atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, stroke, or an arterial or venous thrombotic event. In another example, the subject may have, suspected of having, or at risk for a disease associated with the pKal signaling pathway, e.g., HAE such as Type I, Type II, or Type III HAE. In yet another example, the subject may have, suspected of having, or at risk for an ocular disease, which can be macular edema, diabetic retinopathy, hypertensive retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, or retinal vein occlusions.</p>Also within the scope of the present disclosure are pharmaceutical compositions comprising any of the anti-FXIIa anti",
    " Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032)2, Fv), single chain (scFv), mutants thereof, fusion proteins comprising an antibody portion, humanized antibodies, chimeric antibodies, diabodies, nanobodies, linear antibodies, single chain antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies) and any other modified configuration of the immunoglobulin molecule that comprises an antigen recognition site of the required specificity, including glycosylation variants of antibodies, amino acid sequence variants of antibodies, and covalently modified antibodies. An antibody includes an antibody of any class, such as IgD, IgE, IgG, IgA, or IgM (or sub-class thereof), and the antibody need not be of any particular class. Depending on the antibody amino acid sequence of the constant domain of its heavy chains, immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1 and IgA2. The heavy-chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called alpha, delta, epsilon, gamma, and mu, respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known.</p>In some embodiments, the anti-FXIIa antibody as described herein can bind and inhibit the activity of FXIIa by at least 50% (e.g., 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or greater). The apparent inhibition constant (Ki<sup>app </sup>or K<sub>i,app</sub>), which provides a measure of inhibitor potency, is related to the concentration of inhibitor required to reduce enzyme activity and is not dependent on enzyme concentrations. The inhibitory activity of an anti-FXIIa antibody described herein can be determined by routine methods known in the art.</p>The K<sub>i,</sub><sup>app </sup>value of an antibody may be determined by measuring the inhibitory effect of different concentrations of the antibody on the extent of the reaction (e.g., enzyme activity); fitting the change in pseudo-first order rate constant (v) as a function of inhibitor concentration to the modified Morrison equation (Equation 1) yields an estimate of the apparent Ki value. For a competitive inhibitor, the Ki<sup>app </sup>can be obtained from the y-intercept extracted from a linear regression analysis of a plot of K<sub>i,</sub><sup>app </sup>versus substrate concentration.</p>v=A\u00b7([E]-[I]-Kiapp)+([E]-[I]-Kiapp)2+4\ue8a0[E]\u00b7\ue89eKiapp2(Equation\ue89e\ue89e1)</p>Where A is equivalent to v<sub>o</sub>/E, the initial velocity (v<sub>o</sub>) of the enzymatic reaction in the absence of inhibitor (I) divided by the total enzyme concentration (E).</p>In some embodiments, the anti-FXIIa antibody described herein may have a Ki<sup>app </sup>value of 1000, 900, 800, 700, 600, 500, 400, 300, 200, 100, 50, 40, 30, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 pM or less for the target antigen or antigen epitope. In some embodiments, the anti-FXIIa antibody may have a lower Ki<sup>app </sup>for a first target (e.g., FXIIa) relative to a second target (e.g., FXII). Differences in Ki<sup>app </sup>(e.g., for specificity or other comparisons) can be at least 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 37.5, 50, 70, 80, 91, 100, 500, 1000, 10,000 or 10<sup>5 </sup>fold. In some examples, the anti-FXIIa antibody inhibits a first antigen (e.g., a first protein in a first conformation or mimic thereof) better relative to a second antigen (e.g., the same first protein in a second conformation or mimic thereof; or a second protein). In some embodiments, any of the anti-FXIIa antibodies may be further affinity matured to reduce the Ki<sup>app </sup>of the antibody to the target antigen or antigenic epitope thereof.</p>The antibodies described herein can be murine, rat, human, or any other origin (including chimeric or humanized antibodies). Such antibodies are non-naturally occurring, i.e., would not be produced in an animal without human act (e.g., immunizing such an animal with a desired antigen or fragment thereof).</p>Any of the antibodies described herein can be either monoclonal or polyclonal. A \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d refers to a homogenous antibody population and a \u201cpolyclonal antibody\u201d refers to a heterogeneous antibody population. These two terms do not limit the source of an antibody or the manner in which it is made.</p>In one example, the antibody used in the methods described herein is a humanized antibody. Humanized antibodies refer to forms of non-human (e.g. murine) antibodies that are specific chimeric immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains, or antigen-binding fragments thereof that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a complementary determining region (CDR) of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, or rabbit having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances, Fv framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human",
    " antigen than it does with alternative targets. An antibody \u201cspecifically binds\u201d to a target antigen or epitope if it binds with greater affinity, avidity, more readily, and/or with greater duration than it binds to other substances. For example, an antibody that specifically (or preferentially) binds to an antigen (FXIIa) or an antigenic epitope therein is an antibody that binds this target antigen with greater affinity, avidity, more readily, and/or with greater duration than it binds to other antigens or other epitopes in the same antigen. It is also understood with this definition that, for example, an antibody that specifically binds to a first target antigen may or may not specifically or preferentially bind to a second target antigen. As such, \u201cspecific binding\u201d or \u201cpreferential binding\u201d does not necessarily require (although it can include) exclusive binding. In some examples, an antibody that \u201cspecifically binds\u201d to a target antigen or an epitope thereof may not bind to other antigens or other epitopes in the same antigen. In some embodiments, the antibodies described herein specifically bind to FXIIa. In some embodiments, the antibodies described herein specifically bind to FXIIa and do not bind to FXII.</p>As used herein, the term \u201cFactor XIIa\u201d or \u201cFXIIa\u201d refers to the active form of Factor XII and the term \u201cFactor XII\u201d or \u201cFXII\u201d refers to the proenzyme or zymogen of Factor XII (inactive form). FXII is a single chain glycoprotein with a molecule weight of about 80 kD. Once activated, FXII is concerted into the active form, FXIIa, which contains two chains, the heavy chain (353 residues of the human FXIIa heavy chain) and the light chain (243 residues of the human FXIIa light chain), held by a disulfide bond. Human FXII is encoded by gene F12. The amino acid sequence of human FXII is well known in the art, e.g., GenBank Accession Number NP_000496.2.</p>In some embodiments, an anti-FXIIa antibody as described herein has a suitable binding affinity for the target antigen (e.g., FXIIa) or antigenic epitopes thereof. As used herein, \u201cbinding affinity\u201d refers to the apparent association constant or K<sub>A</sub>. The K<sub>A </sub>is the reciprocal of the dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>). The anti-FXIIa antibody described herein may have a binding affinity (K<sub>D</sub>) of at least 10<sup>\u22125</sup>, 10<sup>\u22126</sup>, 10<sup>\u22127</sup>, 10<sup>\u22128</sup>, 10<sup>\u22129</sup>, 10<sup>\u221210 </sup>M, or lower for the target antigen or antigenic epitope. An increased binding affinity corresponds to a decreased K<sub>D</sub>. Higher affinity binding of an antibody for a first antigen relative to a second antigen can be indicated by a higher K<sub>A </sub>(or a smaller numerical value K<sub>D</sub>) for binding the first antigen than the K<sub>A </sub>(or numerical value K<sub>D</sub>) for binding the second antigen. In such cases, the antibody has specificity for the first antigen (e.g., a first protein in a first conformation or mimic thereof) relative to the second antigen (e.g., the same first protein in a second conformation or mimic thereof; or a second protein). In some embodiments, the anti-FXIIa antibodies described herein have a higher binding affinity (a higher K<sub>A </sub>or smaller K<sub>D</sub>) to FXIIa as compared to the binding affinity to the zymogen FXII or another protein in the pKal signaling system. Differences in binding affinity (e.g., for specificity or other comparisons) can be at least 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 37.5, 50, 70, 80, 91, 100, 500, 1000, 10,000 or 10<sup>5 </sup>fold. In some embodiments, any of the anti-FXIIa antibodies may be further affinity matured to increase the binding affinity of the antibody to the target antigen or antigenic epitope thereof.</p>Binding affinity (or binding specificity) can be determined by a variety of methods including equilibrium dialysis, equilibrium binding, gel filtration, ELISA, surface plasmon resonance, or spectroscopy (e.g., using a fluorescence assay). Exemplary conditions for evaluating binding affinity are in HBS-P buffer (10 mM HEPES pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.005% (v/v) Surfactant P20). These techniques can be used to measure the concentration of bound binding protein as a function of target protein concentration. The concentration of bound binding protein ([Bound]) is generally related to the concentration of free target protein ([Free]) by the following equation:</p>[Bound]=[Free]/(Kd+[Free])</p>It is not always necessary to make an exact determination of K<sub>A</sub>, though, since sometimes it is sufficient to obtain a quantitative measurement of affinity, e.g., determined using a method such as ELISA or FACS analysis, is proportional to K<sub>A</sub>, and thus can be used for comparisons, such as determining whether a higher affinity is, e.g., 2-fold higher, to obtain a qualitative measurement of affinity, or to obtain an inference of affinity, e.g., by activity in a functional assay, e.g., an in vitro or in vivo assay.</p>In some embodiments, the anti-FXIIa antibody comprises a heavy chain comprising a heavy chain variable region that comprises a heavy chain CDR1, a heavy chain CDR2, and a heavy chain CDR3. In some instances, the heavy chain CDR3 region comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 111, 112 or 113 (see Table 1). The heavy chain variable region of any of the anti-FXIIa antibodies described herein may further comprise a CDR1 region comprising the formula X<sub>1</sub>YX<sub>3</sub>MX<sub>5 </sub>(SEQ ID NO: 117) as described herein, and/or a CDR2 region comprising the formula X<sub>1</sub>IX<sub>3</sub>PSGX<sub>7</sub>X<sub>8</sub>TX<sub>10</sub>YX<sub>12</sub>DSVKG, (SEQ ID NO: 118), which is also described herein. In some examples, the anti-FXIIa antibody comprises a heavy chain CDR1 region selected from SEQ ID NO: 41-73 and 121 (see Table 1) and/or a CDR2 region selected from SEQ ID NO: 74-110 and 122-124.

The following specific embodiments are, therefore, to be construed as merely illustrative, and not limitative of the remainder of the disclosure in any way whatsoever. All publications cited herein are incorporated by reference for the purposes or subject matter referenced herein.</p>EXAMPLESExample 1: Generation of Anti-FXIIa AntibodiesA phage display selection using Dyax's FAB310 phagemid library was performed using the biotinylated beta fragment of FXIIa immobilized on streptavidin coated beads. Fab molecules that bound to the immobilized FXIIa were isolated. The selection produced a selective Fab inhibitor that specifically bound to the catalytic domain of FXIIa with a Ki<sup>app </sup>of 800 pM. The isolated Fab showed no cross-reactivity towards the following proteases tested at a concentration of 1 \u03bcM: urokinase plasminogen activator, hepatocyte growth factor activator, activated protein C, cathepsin G, C1s, elastase, factor VIIa, factor Xa, factor XIa, plasmin, thrombin alpha, trypsin, urokinase, plasma kallikrein, hepatocyte growth factor activator, and urokinase-type plasminogen activator.</p>The isolated Fab, M71-F06, was affinity matured via multiple strategies, including heavy chain CDR1/2 shuffling, light chain shuffling, heavy chain CDR3 wobble, and a combination of heavy chain CDR3 wobble and heavy chain CDR1/2 shuffle. The heavy chain CDR1/2 shuffle library was constructed by removing the CDR1/2 region of M71-F06 and replacing it with the full library diversity to make an affinity maturation library with a diversity of \u02dc10<sup>8</sup>. The heavy chain CDR3 was varied at each amino acid position from the parental CDR3 sequence of M71-F06 to create a new library, which was also subsequently combined with the HC CDR1/2 shuffle diversity. A second selection was performed using these libraries. As opposed to the selection performed with immobilized FXIIa, as used for the na\u00efve library selection, the affinity maturation libraries were incubated with the biotinylated target in solution at concentrations lower than the parental Ki<sup>app</sup>. The biotinylated FXIIa and any bound Fabs from the libraries were subsequently pulled down on streptavidin coated beads. FIG. 2 presents a schematic of the selection strategy for the identification and generation of anti-FXIIa antibodies.</p>The inhibitory activities of clone M71-F06 against human and mouse FXIIa, as determined by the \u201cin vitro\u201d activity assay described in Example 2 below, are shown in FIG. 4. The APTT value of clone M71-F06 (see Example 2 below) as compared to DX-2930 is shown in FIG. 5. Results also indicate that clone M71-F06 has no inhibitory activity against activated protein C, CCC 1s, Cathepsin G, Elastase, Factor VIIa, Factor Xa, Factor Xia, activated plasma kallikrein, plasmin, thrombin alpha, trypsin, urokinase, HGFA, and uPA, indicating that its inhibitory activity is specific to FXIIa.</p>Any isolated Fabs from the selection were screened by ELISA, resulting in 39 unique isolates. The amino acid sequences of the heavy chain variable regions and light chain variable regions are provided above. These clones are expected to have the same antigen-binding activity and specificity as the parent clone with higher binding affinity.</p>Example 2: Characterization of Anti-FXIIa AntibodiesMethods:Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) AssayInhibitors (or control dilution buffer=25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 125 mM NaCl) were added to neat plasma in a 1:1 mixture, and pre-equilibrated at 37\u00b0 C. for 5 minutes. 2\u00d750 \u03bcl of this mix was dispensed t",
    "tion via western blot analysis.</p>Binding Preference AssayTo determine the binding preference of the anti-FXIIa antibodies, each antibody was incubated with the FXII zymogen other related proteases of the contact/coagulation system. The binding affinity was then assessed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis using a Biacore biosensor. See FIG. 3, panel 3.</p>Flow Model/Capillary Occlusion AssayThe antibodies are tested in an ex vivo flow model in which human blood supplemented with the antibody is passed at different flow rates through collagen coated capillary tubes. Platelet and fibrin deposition are assessed by fluorescence. Platelet and fibrin deposition is inhibited in this system by antibodies that bind zymogen factor XI or factor XII. In a typical experiment, the antibodies are allowed to bind to their targets before blood flow is initiated.</p>Mouse Thrombosis ModelThe antibodies is tested in a mouse model of ferric chloride-induced carotid artery thrombosis. The model incorporates different FeCl<sub>3 </sub>concentrations, starting at the lowest concentration that consistently induces thrombus formation in C57Bl/6 mice (3.5%). If the antibody demonstrates an antithrombotic effect at low FeCl<sub>3 </sub>concentration, progressively higher concentrations are tested until the antithrombotic effect of the antibody is overwhelmed.</p>Results:The 39 isolate anti-FXIIa antibodies were tested in various in vitro activity assays to determine the following properties: Ki apparent, IC<sub>50</sub>, binding preference, such as binding to the FXII zymogen, cross-reactivity with other related proteases in the contact/coagulation system, cross-reactivity with closely related sequence homologs, effect on plasma kallikrein (pKal) generation, activity in human plasma, partial thromboplastin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and lag time to thrombin generation.</p>Results of the assays are presented in Table 3. All 39 isolates were found to delay APTT, while having no effect on PT. Each of the 39 affinity matured isolates all demonstrated Ki<sup>app </sup>increases 10-100 fold over the parental isolate. The antibodies reduced pKal generation as measured by two independent inhibition assays: purified component inhibition assay and plasma inhibition assay.</p>According to SPR analysis (Biacore), the antibodies did not bind the FXII zymogen, and showed specificity toward the catalytic domain when tested against full length FXIIa. The antibodies also prevented the activation of FXI to FXIa.</p>TABLE 3IsolatePlasma Ki<sup>app </sup>(nM)APTT (fold delay)Ki<sup>app </sup>(pM)M0191-E09313.705M0183-C03333.176M0184-F12383.744M0183-H08763.365M0182-D04963.1311M0192-H111013.336M0292-D071153.1114M0183-D081182.0811M0192-F071253.007M0192-G031253.1418M0310-C061352.4657M0192-F011743.188M0191-A031762.8813M0192-A011983.1117M0191-H102163.8113M0177-C122173.8618M0184-B042693.768M0308-H032753.3818M0192-D022793.305M0310-G072954.4822M0192-F063043.499M0310-A043163.4815M0310-F023191.86106M0310-B093313.7312M0310-G063533.187M0182-H01359N/AN/AM0178-A083813.267M0184-D014353.324M0177-A064584.0817M0191-E044603.597M0191-H094633.6116M0192-H044853.519M0192-A035143.3413M0310-G087962.7624M0192-G058523.3815M0183-B1210043.0611M0308-F0415703.2917M0182-B04N/AN/AN/AM0310-F04N/AN/AN/A</p>The inhibitory activities of clone M0192-H11 against human FXIIa, is shown in FIG. 21, and was found to be approximately 4.7+/\u22120.6 pM.</p>Anti-FXIIa antibodies M192-H11 and M192-E09 were also tested in in vivo pharmacokinetic experiments in rats.

Proteolysis is then assessed over time by addition of 10 uM final fluorogenic peptide substrate (PFR-AMC), with initial rate of substrate proteolysis (y-axis) plotted against inhibitor concentration (x-axis) and the resulting data fit to the modified Morrison equation for tight binding inhibitors.

Contact activation is then initiated by the addition of 25% (2.5% final) APTT-XL reagent (dilute ellagic acid; Pacific Haemostasis), the microplate mixed by gentle shaking, and allowed to proceed for 2 minutes at room temperature, whereby 100 nM of CTI is added. 10 ul of this mixture is then removed to a replicate microplate containing 80u1 of assay buffer at pre-equilibrated at 30 C. This dilution plate is then incubated a further 5 minutes at 30 C, and proteolysis of PFR-AMC assessed as above, but with back-calculated concentrations of inhibitor used in the X-axis for curve-fitting to a standard IC50 equation and/or modified Morrison equation (plasma is diluted 1:400 in final assay read).</p>The activities of 559C-X211-A01 observed in the above-noted assays are summarized in Table 5 below:</p>TABLE 5Activities of 559C-X211-A01APTTAPTT(fold delay)(fold delay)using 1 uMusing 1 uMPlasma IC50X211-A01 inX211-A01 inKi<sup>app</sup>Isolate(nM)human plasmamouse plasma(pM)559C-X211-A012893.42.85</p>According to SPR analysis, this antibody binds to FXIIa and does not bind the FXII zymogen.
