The neutralizing antibody or neutralizing antibody fragment of CCR8 means an antibody or antibody fragment having neutralizing activity against CCR8. Whether or not an antibody has neutralizing activity against CCR8 can be determined, for example, by measuring whether or not the antibody inhibits the physiological action of a CCR8 ligand (e.g., CCL1) against CCR8. Examples thereof include, but are not limited to, measuring the binding of CCL1 to CCR8, the migration or intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase of CCR8-expressing cells by CCL1, or the expression variation of genes susceptible to CCL1 stimulation.

    " human CCR8 (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P51685, SEQ ID NO: 1) was used as an antigen and DNA-immunized to A/J Jms Slc female mice. DNA immunization was repeated two or three times at two-week intervals and boosted by intraperitoneally administering human CCR8-expressing Expi293 cells one week after final immunization. After three days, spleen was removed, and splenocytes and mouse myeloma cells (p3x6363-Ag8, Tokyo Oncology Institute) were fused by the PEG method, and selection was made in a medium containing hypoxanthine, aminopterin and thymidine. With the obtained culture supernatant, anti-human CCR8 antibodies and anti-human CCR8 neutralizing antibodies were selected by the following method.</p>For anti-human CCR8 antibodies, the culture supernatant was reacted with human CCR8-expressing Expi293 cells and human CCR4-expressing Expi293 cells, respectively, and clones that specifically bind only to human CCR8 were selected by detecting with Alexa488-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibodies (manufactured by Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p>For anti-human CCR8 neutralizing antibodies, the culture supernatant was sufficiently reacted with human CCR8 expressing 293 cells in which a Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator was incorporated beforehand, then Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx by addition of 200 nM hCCL1 (manufactured by BioLegend) was measured with FLIPR, and clones that inhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx by hCCL1 stimulation were selected.</p>Clones that exhibited particularly strong neutralizing activity (% inhibition &gt;80%) and clones that had no neutralizing activity were respectively cloned to establish hybridomas.</p>Test Example 2: Production of Anti-Human CCR8 Antibody-Producing Rat HybridomaThe immunogen, a human CCR8-expressing Rat-1 cell, was produced by transfecting Rat-1 cells with an expression vector in which the human CCR8 gene was cloned into pQCXIP (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.), then subjecting the cells to drug selection with puromycin (1 ug/ml) for one month.</p>The human CCR8-expressing Rat-1 cells were used to immunize rats once.

Of the obtained 40 clones, purified antibodies of 27 neutralizing antibodies and 13 non-neutralizing antibodies were used to perform an antigen-binding test by the method described below to identify epitopes important for neutralizing activity. For the neutralizing activity of each clone, inhibitory activity against Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx by 100 nM hCCL1 (manufactured by BioLegend) addition was measured with FLIPR by the method described in Test Example 1. Each neutralizing antibody had an IC50 value of 2 nM or less of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx inhibitory activity by 100 nM hCCL1 stimulation.</p>The gene encoding the full length of human CCR8 (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P51685, SEQ ID NO: 1), the gene encoding the full length of human CCR4 (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P51679, SEQ ID NO: 48) and the gene encoding the full length of mouse CCR8 (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P56484, SEQ ID NO: 39) were cloned into pcDNA 3.4 vectors, respectively.

The cells were then treated with a red blood cell lysing solution (BD Biosciences) for 5 minutes to remove red blood cells, and further washed twice with a 2% FBS/10 mM HEPES/HBSS buffer. Tumor-infiltrating cells were stained by the following method with the antibodies described below.</p>Infiltrating cells were stained in ice with a Zombie NIR Fixable Viability Kit (BioLegend) reagent for 30 minutes. After one wash with 2% FBS/10 mM HEPES/HBSS, the cells were stained with Bv510-labeled anti-mouse CD45 (30-F11, BioLegend), FITC-labeled anti-mouse CD4 (RM4-4, BioLegend), PE/Cy7-labeled anti-mouse CD8 (53-6.7, BioLegend), PerCP/Cy5.5-labeled anti-mouse TCRB (H57-597, BioLegend), PE-labeled anti-mouse CD25 (PC61, BioLegend), BV421-labeled anti-human CCR8 antibody (433H, BD Biosciences) (or BV421-labeled isotope control antibody). Staining was performed in ice for 30 minutes. After washing twice with 2% FBS/HEPES/HBSS, the cells were analyzed using a flow cytometer.</p>Human CCR8 expression in CD45+TCRB+CD4+CD25+ T cells was analyzed. Negative cell regions were determined by staining with isotype-controlled antibodies, and the frequency of positive in intratumoral infiltrating cells in cancer in 17 days after inoculation was calculated by taking cells becoming positive with anti-human CCR8 antibodies as human CCR8+ cells. As a result, human CCR8 was detected in approximately 47% of CD45+TCRB+CD4+CD25+ cells in mouse tumors.</p>(3) Evaluation of Antitumor Effect of Anti-Human CCR8 Antibody Administration in Mice Inoculated with Colon Cancer-Derived CT26 Cells</p>On back skin of hCCR8-KI (KI/KI) mice (8 weeks old, female), 4\u00d710<sup>5 </sup>(50 uL) colon cancer-derived CT26 cells were inoculated. 4 and 11 days after tumor inoculation, 100 \u03bcg (100 \u03bcL) or 200 \u03bcg (100 \u03bcL) of the humanized 10A11 antibody (light chain variable region: IGKV4-1 N53Q+G29R (SEQ ID NO: 59)/heavy chain variable region: IGHV3-15 T94R (SEQ ID NO: 41)) was administered intravenously (N=10).
