Pharmacol. 30: 427 (1986). The [3H]nicotine (Specific Activity=81.5 Ci/mmol) was obtained from NEN Research Products. The binding of [<sup>3</sup>H]nicotine was measured using a 3 h incubation at 4\u00b0 C. Incubations were conducted in 48-well micro-titre plates and contained about 400 \u03bcg of protein per well in a final incubation volume of 300 \u03bcL. The incubation buffer was PBS and the final concentration of [<sup>3</sup>H]nicotine was 5 nM. The binding reaction was terminated by filtration of the protein containing bound ligand onto glass fiber filters (GF/B, Brandel) using a Brandel Tissue Harvester at 4\u00b0 C. Filters were soaked in de-ionized water containing 0.33% polyethyleneimine to reduce non-specific binding. Each filter was washed with ice-cold buffer (3\u00d71 ml). Non-specific binding was determined by inclusion of 10 \u03bcM non-radioactive L-nicotine (Acros Organics) in selected wells.</p>The inhibition of [<sup>3</sup>H]nicotine binding by test compounds was determined by including seven different concentrations of the test compound in selected wells. Each concentration was replicated in triplicate. IC<sub>50 </sub>values were estimated as the concentration of compound that inhibited 50 percent of specific [3H]nicotine binding. Inhibition constants (Ki values), reported in nM, were calculated from the IC<sub>50 </sub>values using the method of Cheng et al., Biochem. Pharmacol. 22: 3099 (1973).</p>\u03b17 SubtypeRats (female, Sprague-Dawley), weighing 150-250 g, were maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle and were allowed free access to water and food supplied by PMI Nutrition International, Inc. Animals were anaesthetized with 70% CO2, then decapitated. Brains were removed and placed on an ice-cold platform. The hippocampus was removed and placed in 10 volumes (weight: volume) of ice-cold preparative buffer (137 mM NaCl, 10.7 mM KCl, 5.8 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 8 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 20 mM HEPES (free acid), 5 mM iodoacetamide, 1.6 mM EDTA, pH 7.4); PMSF, dissolved in methanol to a final concentration of 100 \u03bcM, was added and the tissue suspension was homogenized by Polytron. The homogenate was centrifuged at 18,000\u00d7g for 20 min at 4\u00b0 C. and the resulting pellet was re-suspended in 10 volumes of ice-cold water. After 60 min incubation on ice, a new pellet was collected by centrifugation at 18,000\u00d7g for 20 min at 4\u00b0 C. The final pellet was re-suspended in 10 volumes of buffer and stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. On the day of the assay, tissue was thawed, centrifuged at 18,000\u00d7g for 20 min, and then re-suspended in ice-cold PBS (Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline, 138 mM NaCl, 2.67 mM KCl, 1.47 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 8.1 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 0.9 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, Invit",

[<sup>3</sup>H]MLA (Specific Activity=25-35 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Tocris. The binding of [<sup>3</sup>H]MLA was determined using a 2 h incubation at 21\u00b0 C. Incubations were conducted in 48-well micro-titre plates and contained about 200 pg of protein per well in a final incubation volume of 300 \u03bcL. The incubation buffer was PBS and the final concentration of [<sup>3</sup>H]MLA was 5 nM. The binding reaction was terminated by filtration of the protein containing bound ligand onto glass fiber filters (GF/B, Brandel) using a Brandel Tissue Harvester at room temperature. Filters were soaked in de-ionized water containing 0.33% polyethyleneimine to reduce non-specific binding. Each filter was washed with PBS (3\u00d71 ml) at room temperature. Non-specific binding was determined by inclusion of 50 \u03bcM non-radioactive MLA in selected wells.</p>The inhibition of [<sup>3</sup>H]MLA binding by test compounds was determined by including seven different concentrations of the test compound in selected wells.

Neurochem. 54: 937 (1990). Rats (female, Sprague-Dawley), weighing 150-250 g, were maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle and were allowed free access to water and food supplied by PMI Nutrition International, Inc.</p>Animals were anaesthetized with 70% CO<sub>2</sub>, then decapitated. The brains were quickly removed and the striata dissected. Striatal tissue from each of 2 rats was pooled and homogenized in ice-cold 0.32 M sucrose (5 ml) containing 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, using a glass/glass homogenizer. The tissue was then centrifuged at 1,000\u00d7g for 10 min. The pellet was discarded and the supernatant was centrifuged at 12,000\u00d7g for 20 min. The resulting pellet was re-suspended in perfusion buffer containing monoamine oxidase inhibitors (128 mM NaCl, 1.2 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2.4 mM KCl, 3.2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 25 mM HEPES, 1 mM ascorbic acid, 0.02 mM pargyline HCl and 10 mM glucose, pH 7.4) and centrifuged for 15 min at 25,000\u00d7g.

Thus, the data indicated that the compounds have the capability of being useful in treating CNS disorders involving nicotinic cholinergic systems.</p>Furthermore, the data indicate that certain of these compounds do not cause any appreciable side effects at muscle sites or ganglionic sites at concentrations effective for producing CNS effects or neurotransmitter release (as low as 30 nM for dopamine release), thus indicating a lack of undesirable side effects in subjects receiving administration of those compounds at dose ranges at which CNS effects and neurotransmitter release are elicited.</p>The foregoing is illustrative of the present invention and is not to be construed as limiting thereof. The invention is defined by the following claims, with equivalents of the claims to be included therein.</p>"
