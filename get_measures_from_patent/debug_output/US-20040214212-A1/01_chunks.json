    "L epitope/HTL epitope conjugates are linked by a spacer molecule. The spacer is typically comprised of relatively small, neutral molecules, such as amino acids or amino acid mimetics, which are substantially uncharged under physiological conditions. The spacers are typically selected from, e.g., Ala, Gly, or other neutral spacers of nonpolar amino acids or neutral polar amino acids. It will be understood that the optionally present spacer need not be comprised of the same residues and thus may be a hetero- or homo-oligomer. When present, the spacer will usually be at least one or two residues, more usually three to six residues and sometimes 10 or more residues. The CTL peptide epitope can be linked to the T helper peptide epitope either directly or via a spacer either at the amino or carboxy terminus of the CTL peptide. The amino terminus of either the immunogenic peptide or the T helper peptide may be acylated. </p>[0408] In certain embodiments, the T helper peptide is one that is recognized by T helper cells present in a majority of a genetically diverse population. This can be accomplished by selecting peptides that bind to many, most, or all of the HLA class II molecules. Examples of such amino acid bind many HLA Class II molecules include sequences from antigens such as tetanus toxoid at positions 830-843 QYIKANSKFIGITE; (SEQ ID NO: 13), Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite (CS) protein at positions 378-398 DIEKKIAKMEKASSVFNVVNS; (SEQ ID NO: 14), and Streptococcus 18 kD protein at positions 116-131 GAVDSILGGVATYGAA; (SEQ ID NO: 15). Other examples include peptides bearing a DR 1-4-7 supermotif, or either of the DR3 motifs. </p>[0409] Alternatively, it is possible to prepare synthetic peptides capable of stimulating T helper lymphocytes, in a loosely HLA-restricted fashion, using amino acid sequences not found in nature (see, e.g., PCT publication WO 95/07707). These synthetic compounds called Pan-DR-binding epitopes (e.g., PADRE\u2122, Epimmune, Inc., San Diego, Calif.) are designed, most preferably, to bind most HLA-DR (human HLA class II) molecules. For instance, a pan-DR-binding epitope peptide having the formula: xKXVAAWTLKAAx (SEQ ID NO: 16), where \u201cX\u201d is either cyclohexylalanine, phenylalanine, or tyrosine, and a is either D-alanine or L-alanine, has been found to bind to most HLA-DR alleles, and to stimulate the response of T helper lymphocytes from most individuals, regardless of their HLA type. An alternative of a pan-DR binding epitope comprises all \u201cL\u201d natural amino acids and can be provided in the form of nucleic acids that encode the epitope. </p>[0410] HTL peptide epitopes can also be modified to alter their biological properties. For example, they can be modified to include D-amino acids to increase their resistance to proteases and thus extend their serum half life, or they can be conjugated to other molecules such as lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, and the like to increase their biological activity. For example, a T helper pe",
    "emical libraries, peptide analogs, etc. </p>[0511] Of particular interest are assays to identify agents that have a low toxicity for human cells. A wide variety of assays can be used for this purpose, including proliferation assays, cAMP assays, labeled in vitro protein-protein binding assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, immunoassays for protein binding, functional assays (phosphorylation assays, etc.) and the like. </p>[0512] A determination of binding of the test compound (ligand, binding agent, modulator, etc.) to a cancer protein of the invention can be done in a number of ways. The test compound can be labeled, and binding determined directly, e.g., by attaching all or a portion of the cancer protein of the invention to a solid support, adding a labeled candidate compound (e.g., a fluorescent label), washing off excess reagent, and determining whether the label is present on the solid support. Various blocking and washing steps can be utilized as appropriate. </p>[0513] In certain embodiments, only one of the components is labeled, e.g., a protein of the invention or ligands labeled. Alternatively, more than one component is labeled with different labels, e.g., I<sup>125</sup>, for the proteins and a fluorophor for the compound. Proximity reagents, e.g., quenching or energy transfer reagents are also useful. </p>Competitive Binding to Identify and Characterize Modulators [0514] In one embodiment, the binding of the \u201ctest compound\u201d is determined by competitive binding assay with a \u201ccompetitor.\u201d The competitor is a binding moiety that binds to the target molecule (e.g., a cancer protein of the invention). Competitors include compounds such as antibodies, peptides, binding partners, ligands, etc. Under certain circumstances, the competitive binding between the test compound and the competitor displaces the test compound. In one embodiment, the test compound is labeled. Either the test compound, the competitor, or both, is added to the protein for a time sufficient to allow binding. Incubations are performed at a temperature that facilitates optimal activity, typically between four and 40\u00b0 C. Incubation periods are typically optimized, e.g., to facilitate rapid high throughput screening; typically between zero and one hour will be sufficient. Excess reagent is generally removed or washed away. The second component is then added, and the presence or absence of the labeled component is followed, to indicate binding. </p>[0515] In one embodiment, the competitor is added first, followed by the test compound. Displacement of the competitor is an indication that the test compound is binding to the cancer protein and thus is capable of binding to, and potentially modulating, the activity of the cancer protein. In this embodiment, either component can be labeled. Thus, e.g., if the competitor is labeled, the presence of label in the post-test compound wash solution indicates displacement by the test compound. Alternatively, if the test compou",

Alternatively, the vaccine can be administered as a minigene construct or as dendritic cells which have been loaded with the peptide epitopes in vitro. </p>Example 27 Use of Peptides to Evaluate an Immune Response [0729] Peptides of the invention may be used to analyze an immune response for the presence of specific antibodies, CTL or HTL directed to 254P1D6B. Such an analysis can be performed in a manner described by Ogg et al., Science 279:2103-2106, 1998. In this Example, peptides in accordance with the invention are used as a reagent for diagnostic or prognostic purposes, not as an immunogen. </p>[0730] In this example highly sensitive human leukocyte antigen tetrameric complexes (\u201ctetramers\u201d) are used for a cross-sectional analysis of, for example, 254P1D6B HLA-A*0201-specific CTL frequencies from HLA A*0201-positive individuals at different stages of disease or following immunization comprising a 254P1D6B peptide containing an A*0201 motif. Tetrameric complexes are synthesized as described (Musey et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 337:1267, 1997). Briefly, purified HLA heavy chain (A*0201 in this example) and \u03b22-microglobulin are synthesized by means of a prokaryotic expression system. The heavy chain is modified by deletion of the transmembrane-cytosolic tail and COOH-terminal addition of a sequence containing a BirA enzymatic biotinylation site. The heavy chain, \u03b22-microglobulin, and peptide are refolded by dilution. The 45-kD refolded product is isolated by fast protein liquid chromatography and then biotinylated by BirA in the presence of biotin (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.), adenosine 5\u2032 triphosphate and magnesium. Streptavidin-phycoerythrin conjugate is added in a 1:4 molar ratio, and the tetrameric product is concentrated to 1 mg/ml. The resulting product is referred to as tetramer-phycoerythrin. </p>[0731] For the analysis of patient blood samples, approximately one million PBMCs are centrifuged at 300 g for 5 minutes and resuspended in 50 \u03bcl of cold phosphate-buffered saline. Tri-color analysis is performed with the tetramer-phycoerythrin, along with anti-CD8-Tricolor, and anti-CD38. The PBMCs are incubated with tetramer and antibodies on ice for 30 to 60 min and then washed twice before formaldehyde fixation. Gates are applied to contain&gt;99.98% of control samples. Controls for the tetramers include both A*0201-negative individuals and A*0201-positive non-diseased donors. The percentage of cells stained with the tetramer is then determined by flow cytometry. The results indicate the number of cells in the PBMC sample that contain epitope-restricted CTLs, thereby readily indicating the extent of immune response to the 254P1D6B epitope, and thus the status of exposure to 254P1D6B, or exposure to a vaccine that elicits a protective or therapeutic response. </p>Example 28 Use of Peptide Epitopes to Evaluate Recall Responses [0732] The peptide epitopes of the invention are used as reagents to eva"
