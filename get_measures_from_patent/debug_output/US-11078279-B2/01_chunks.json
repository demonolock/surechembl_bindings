There are currently several known members of the family: B7.1 (CD80), B7.2 (CD86), the inducible co-stimulator ligand (ICOS-L), the programmed death-1 ligand (PD-L1; B7-H1), the programmed death-2 ligand (PD-L2; B7-DC), B7-H3, B7-H4 and B7-H6 (Collins, M. et al.

PD-1Programmed Death-1 (\u201cPD-1\u201d) is an approximately 31 kD type I membrane protein member of the extended CD28/CTLA-4 family of T-cell regulators that broadly negatively regulates immune responses (Ishida, Y. et al. (1992) \u201cInduced Expression Of PD-1, A Novel Member Of The Immunoglobulin Gene Superfamily, Upon Programmed Cell Death,\u201d EMBO J. 11:3887-3895; United States Patent Application Publication No. 2007/0202100; 2008/0311117; 2009/00110667; U.S. Pat.

(2002) \u201cExpression Of Programmed Death 1 Ligands By Murine T-Cells And APC,\u201d J. Immunol. 169:5538-5545) and at low levels in natural killer (NK) T-cells (Nishimura, H. et al.

ExamplesHaving now generally described the invention, the same will be more readily understood through reference to the following examples, which are provided by way of illustration and are not intended to be limiting of the present invention unless specified.</p>Example 1BIACore Affinity DeterminationsThe kinetic parameters of the binding of eluted and purified antibodies were analyzed using a BIAcore assay (BIAcore\u00ae instrument 1000, BIAcore Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) and associated software. HER-2 was immobilized on one of the four flow cells (flow cell 2) of a sensor chip surface through amine coupling chemistry (by modification of carboxymethyl groups with mixture of NHS/EDC) such that about 1-000 response units (RU) of receptor was immobilized on the surface. Following this, the unreacted active esters were \u201ccapped off\u201d with an injection of 1M Et-NH2. Once a suitable surface was prepared, ch4D5-FcWT (wild-type Fc), ch4D5, and trastuzumab (control) were injected at concentrations of 6.25-200 nM over the surface at a flow rate of 70 mL/min for 180 sec.</p>Once an entire data set was collected, the resulting binding curves were globally fitted and the rate constants and apparent equilibrium binding constant were calculated using computer algorithms supplied by the manufacturer, as described in the BIAevaluation Software Handbook available from BIAcore, Inc. FIG. 3 shows the graphical results of the SPR analysis, and the calculated constants are provided in Table 4.</p>TABLE 4Kinetic and Equilibrium Constants Calculated from BIAcore DataAnalyteKa1 (1/mole*s)Kd1 (1/s)K<sub>D </sub>(nm)ch4D5-wild-type Fc1.7 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup>~3.2 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>(est.)\u2014ch4D51.1 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup>~6.3 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22126 </sup>(est.)\u2014trastuzumab1.6 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup>\u2009\u20091.3 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22124</sup>0.8</p>Example 2ApoptosisVarious cell lines were incubated overnight with ch4D5 and ch4D5-FcMT1.
