    "e and the released [<sup>3</sup>H]-acetic acid was quantified by scintillation counting. For inhibition studies, the enzyme was preincubated with compounds at 4 \u00b0C for 30 minutes prior to initiation of the enzymatic assay. IC<sub>50</sub> values for HDAC enzyme inhibitors were determined by performing dose response curves with individual compounds and determining the concentration of inhibitor producing fifty percent of the maximal inhibition. IC<sub>5</sub>o values for representative compounds assayed using this procedure are presented in the third column of Tables 7-10 (excepting bracketed data).</p>\n  2. Human HDAC-1: Assay 2</p>\n  [0156] In the alternative, the following protocol was used to assay the compounds of the invention. In the assay, the buffer used was 25mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 137mM NaCI, 2.7mM KCI, ImM MgCI<sub>2</sub> and the subtrate was Boc-Lys(Ac)-AMC in a 50mM stock solution in DMSO. The enzyme stock solution was 4.08 \u03bcg/mL in buffer.</p>\n  [0157] The compounds were pre-incubated (2\u03bcl in DMSO diluted to 13 \u03bcl in buffer for transfer to assay plate) with enzyme (20\u03bcl of 4.08\u03bcg/ml) for 10 minutes at room temperature (35\u03bcl pre- incubation volume). The mixture was pre-incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was started by bringing the temperature to 37\u00b0C and adding 16 \u03bcl substrate. Total reaction volume was 50\u03bcl. The reaction was stopped after 20 minutes by addition of 50\u03bcl developer, prepared as directed by Biomol ( Fluor-de-Lys developer, Cat. # KI-105). A plate was incubated in the dark for 10 minutes at room temperature before reading (\u03bb<sub>Ex</sub>=360nm, \u03bb<sub>Em</sub>=470nm, Cutoff filter at 435nm). [0158] IC<sub>5</sub>o values for representative compounds assayed using this procedure are presented in the third column of Table 9 (bracketed [ ] data). \n\n3. MTT Assay</p>\n  [0159] HCT116 cells (2000/well) were plated into 96-well tissue culture plates one day before compound treatment. Compounds at various concentrations were added to the cells. The cells were incubated for 72 hours at 37\u00b0C in 5% C0 incubator. MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide, Sigma) was added at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and incubated with the cells for 4 hours before one volume of solubilization buffer (50% N,N-dimethylformamide, 20% SDS, pH 4.7) was added onto the cultured cells. After overnight incubation, solubilized dye was quantified by colorimetric reading at 570 nM using a reference at 630 nM using an MR700 plate reader (Dynatech Laboratories Inc.). OD values were converted to cell numbers according to a standard growth curve of the relevant cell line. The concentration which reduces cell numbers to 50% of that of solvent treated cells is determined as MTT IC<sub>50</sub>. IC<sub>50</sub> values for representative compounds are presented in the fourth column of Tables 7-10.</p>\n  4.
