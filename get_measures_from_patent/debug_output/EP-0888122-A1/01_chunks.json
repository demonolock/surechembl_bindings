    "tantially over the similar hybrid, it was still lower than that of the native IFN\u03b1.</p>\n  However, it is expected that this hybrid will have a longer half-life in vivo, than the native IFN\u03c3. This</p>\n  expectation is based on results demonstrating that the related IFN\u03b1 hybrid with the linker sequence</p>\n  shown in SEQ ID N0:2 and an IgGI Fc portion showed a much longer half-life, in a pharmacoki\u03c0etic</p>\n  study in a mouse model, than did the native IFN\u03b1.</p>\n  Because the hybrid of SEQ ID N0:7 is expected to have a longer half-life in vivo than native</p>\n  IFN\u03c3, even though its specific activity is lower, this novel hybrid is expected to be preferred to the</p>\n  native IFN\u03c3 for clinical use. This is because, as a result of the longer half -life, the Cxt (the area</p>\n  under the concentration vs. time curve) would be up to several hundred times greater than for the</p>\n  native IFN\u03b1. This means that at the equivalent molar dosage of the native IFN\u03b1 and the hybrid, the</p>\n  latter would provide a several hundred fold increased exposure to IFN\u03c3, resulting in vastly increased</p>\n  efficacy at the same dosage, and less frequent administration.</p>\n  In measuring specific activity, molar dosage is preferred instead of expressing activity as units</p>\n  per mass of protein. This is because i\u03c0terferons function through the binding to their specific</p>\n  receptors, which is directly related to the number of molecules present. Also, the molecular weight \n\nof the IFN\u03c3-Fc 4, 110 Kd, is more than five-fold larger than that of the wild type IFN\u03c32a, which is</p>\n  20kd. Taking this into consideration, measuring activity in units/\u03bcmol instead of the units/mg provides</p>\n  a better comparison of activity specifity.</p>\n  Example I: Cloning human IFN\u03c3 cDNA and constructing the IFN\u03c3-Fc expression vector</p>\n  6x10<sup>\u03b2</sup> KG-1 cells (ATCC 246) were incubated with 200 units of Se\u03c0dai virus at 37\u00b0C</p>\n  overnight. The cells were harvested and washed with PBS throughly. The total RNA was extracted</p>\n  by using the RNA-ZOL RNA isolation kit (BIOTEX, Houston, TX) following the procedure provided by</p>\n  the manufacturer. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using AMV reverse</p>\n  transcriptase with oiigo(dT) as 3' primer in 50m Tris-HCI (pH 8.3), SOmMKCI, and 6mM MgCI,,</p>\n  incubated at 42\u00b0 C for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was used directly as the template for PCR to</p>\n  amplify IFN\u03c3 cDNA. The 5' primer for PCR contained a Hind III site and the coding sequence for the</p>\n  first 21 amino acids from the IFN\u03c32a leader peptide (SEQ ID NQ:3). The 3' primer contained the</p>\n  sequence coding for part of the linker (SEQ ID NQ:1) and the last five amino acids of the IFN\u03c32a, and</p>\n  a BamH I site integrated in the linker sequence (SEQ ID N0:4). The PCR buffer contained 50mM KCI,</p>\n  lOmMTris-Hcl (pH8.3), 1.5mM MgCI<sub>2</sub>, 0.01% gelatin, 0.1 mmol each of dNTP, 0.5 \u03bcmol of each</p>\n  primers, 5 \u03bcl RT reaction mixture, "
