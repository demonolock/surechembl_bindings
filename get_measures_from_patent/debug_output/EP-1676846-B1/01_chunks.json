    " to the C-terminal region of MMP9, leading to inhibition of the catalytic domain of MMP9. The balance of induced expression of ProMMP9, cleavage of Pro- to active MMP9 and the presence of TIMP-1 combine to determine the amount of catalytically active MMP9 which is present at a local site. Proteolytically active MMP9 attacks substrates which include gelatin, elastin, and native Type IV and Type V collagens; it has no activity against native Type I collagen, proteoglycans or laminins.</p>There has been a growing body of data implicating roles for MMP9 in various physiological and pathological processes. Physiological roles include the invasion of embryonic trophoblasts through the uterine epithelium in the early stages of embryonic implantation; some role in the growth and development of bones; and migration of inflammatory cells from the vasculature into tissues.</p>MMP-9 release, measured using enzyme immunoassay, was significantly enhanced in fluids and in AM supernantants from untreated asthmatics compared with those from other populations [Am. J. Resp. Cell &amp; Mol. Biol., Nov 1997, 17 (5):583-591]. Also, increased MMP9 expression has been observed in certain other pathological conditions, thereby implicating MMP9 in disease processes such as COPD, arthritis, tumour metastasis, Alzheimer's, Multiple Sclerosis, and plaque rupture in atherosclerosis leading to acute coronary conditions such as Myocardial Infarction.</p>MMP-8 (collagenase-2, neutrophil collagenase) is a 53 kD enzyme of the matrix metalloproteinase family that is preferentially expressed in neutrophils. Later studies indicate MMP-8 is expressed also in other cells, such as osteoarthritic chondrocytes [Shlopov et al, 1997, Arthritis Rheum, 40:2065]. MMPs produced by neutrophils can cause tissue remodelling, and hence blocking MMP-8 should have a positive effect in fibrotic diseases of for instance the lung, and in degradative diseases like pulmonary emphysema. MMP-8 was also found to be up-regulated in osteoarthritis, indicating that blocking MMP-8 many also be beneficial in this disease.</p>MMP-3 (stromelysin-1) is a 53 kD enzyme of the matrix metalloproteinase enzyme family. MMP-3 activity has been demonstrated in fibroblasts isolated from inflamed gingiva [Uitto V. J. et al, 1981, J. Periodontal Res., 16:417-424], and enzyme levels have been correlated to the severity of gum disease [Overall C. M. et al, 1987, J. Periodontal Res., 22:81-88]. MMP-3 is also produced by basal keratinocytes in a variety of chronic ulcers [Saarialho-Kere U. K. et al, 1994, J. Clin. Invest., 94:79-88]. MMP-3 mRNA and protein were detected in basal keratinocytes adjacent to but distal from the wound edge in what probably represents the sites of proliferating epidermis. MMP-3 may thus prevent the epidermis from healing. Several investigators have demonstrated consistent elevation of MMP-3 in synovial fluids from rheumatoid and osteoarthritis patients as compared to controls [Walakovits L. A. et al, 1992, Arthritis Rheum., 35:35-42; Zafarullah M. et al, 1993, J. Rheumatol., 20:693-697]. These studies provided the basis for the belief that an inhibitor of MMP-3 will treat diseases involving disruption of extracellular matrix resulting in inflammation due to lymphocytic infiltration, or loss of structural integrity necessary for organ function.</p>A number of metalloproteinase inhibitors are known (see for example the review of MMP inhibitors by Beckett R.P. and Whittaker M., 1998, Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents, 8(3):259-282]. Different classes of compounds may have different degrees of potency and selectivity for inhibit"
