Biological evaluation</p>\u00a0Amino-quinoxalines were then evaluated for their neuroprotective and neurodifferentiating (or neuritogenic) properties.</p>\u00a0II.1 Effect of compounds on the neuroprotection and differentiation of dopaminergic neurons in primary culture in a model of spontaneous degeneration.</p>II.1.1 Structure-activity relationship and determination of the effective concentration (EC50) \u2022 The quinoxaline derivatives were tested on a model of spontaneous degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in culture according to the protocol described in the article by F. Schmidt et al. PLoS ONE 2009, 4 (7) e2615 (\"Chemicals Possessing a Neurotrophin-Like Activity on Dopaminergic Neurons in Primary Culture\"). This model consists in the culture of ventral mesencephalon of rat embryo. This part of the brain in culture contains a proportion of dopaminergic neurons of 5% of the total neurons, the other neurons being essentially GABAergic. These cultures are also composed of glial cells namely astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia. These cultures are characterized by the progressive death of neurons. The neuroprotective effect of the compounds according to the invention was evaluated by counting dopaminergic neurons (TH <sup>+</sup> ) labeled by immunohistochemistry of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) after 8 days of culture. Thus, for example, the compounds 4aa, 4ba, 4ad, 4bd, 4bc and 4ed have been evaluated at \u0399\u03b7\u039c, \u0399\u039f\u03b7\u039c,  \u0399\u039f\u039f\u03b7\u039c and \u0399 \u03bc\u039c and compared to the activity of cyclic dibutyryl-AMP (dbc-AMP) at 200 \u03bc\u039c.</p>Table 1.
