    ", 20060088908, 20050106660, and PCT Publication No. WO2006/056464, incorporated herein by reference.</p>Scaffolds derived from toxins such as, for example, toxins from scorpions, insects, plants, mollusks, etc., and the protein inhibiters of neuronal NO synthase (PIN) may also be used in certain aspects.</p>Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) are recognized to have certain advantages, e.g., reproducibility and large-scale production. Embodiments include monoclonal antibodies of the human, murine, monkey, rat, hamster, rabbit and chicken origin.</p>\u201cHumanized\u201d antibodies are also contemplated, as are chimeric antibodies from mouse, rat, or other species, bearing human constant and/or variable region domains, bispecific antibodies, recombinant and engineered antibodies and fragments thereof. As used herein, the term \u201chumanized\u201d immunoglobulin refers to an immunoglobulin comprising a human framework region and one or more CDR's from a non-human (usually a mouse or rat) immunoglobulin. The non-human immunoglobulin providing the CDR's is called the \u201cdonor\u201d and the human immunoglobulin providing the framework is called the \u201cacceptor\u201d. A \u201chumanized antibody\u201d is an antibody comprising a humanized light chain and a humanized heavy chain immunoglobulin. In order to describe antibodies of some embodiments, the strength with which an antibody molecule binds an epitope, known as affinity, can be measured. The affinity of an antibody may be determined by measuring an association constant (Ka) or dissociation constant (Kd). Antibodies deemed useful in certain embodiments may have an association constant of about, at least about, or at most about 10e6, 10e7, 10e8, 10e9 or M or any range derivable therein. Similarly, in some embodiments antibodies may have a dissociation constant of about, at least about or at most about 10e-6, 10e-7, 10e-8, 10e-9 or M or any range derivable therein. These values are reported for antibodies discussed herein and the same assay may be used to evaluate the binding properties of such antibodies</p>In certain embodiments, a polypeptide that specifically binds to DC receptors is able to bind a DC receptor on the surface of the cells and present an HPV antigen that allows the generation of a robust immune response. Moreover, in some embodiments, the polypeptide that is used can provided protective immunity against HPV or provides a means of therapy for HPV by generating a robust immune response.</p>1. Methods for Generating Antibodies</p>Methods for generating antibodies (e.g., monoclonal antibodies and/or monoclonal antibodies) are known in the art. Briefly, a polyclonal antibody is prepared by immunizing an animal with a DC receptor polypeptide or a portion thereof in accordance with embodiments and collecting antisera from that immunized animal.</p>A wide range of animal species can be used for the production of antisera. Typically the animal used for production of antisera is a rabbit, a mouse, a rat, a hamster, a guinea pig or a goat. The choice of animal may be decided upon the ease of manipulation, costs or the desired amount of sera, as would be known to one of skill in the art. It will be appreciated that antibodies can also be produced transgenically through the generation of a mammal or plant"
