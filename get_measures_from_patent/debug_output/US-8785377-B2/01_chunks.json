    "operties against the HCV NS3 protease. The following examples describe assays in which the compounds of the present invention can be tested for anti-HCV effects.</p>Example 122NS3/NS4a Protease Enzyme AssayHCV protease activity and inhibition is assayed using an internally quenched fluorogenic substrate. A DABCYL and an EDANS group are attached to opposite ends of a short peptide. Quenching of the EDANS fluorescence by the DABCYL group is relieved upon proteolytic cleavage. Fluorescence is measured with a Molecular Devices Fluoromax (or equivalent) using an excitation wavelength of 355 nm and an emission wavelength of 485 nm.</p>The assay is run in Corning white half-area 96-well plates (VWR 29444-312 [Corning 3693]) with full-length NS3 HCV protease 1b tethered with NS4A cofactor (final enzyme concentration 1 to 15 nM). The assay buffer is complemented with 10 \u03bcM NS4A cofactor Pep 4A (Anaspec 25336 or in-house, MW 1424.8). RET S1 (Ac-Asp-Glu-Asp(EDANS)-Glu-Glu-Abu-[COO]Ala-Ser-Lys-(DABCYL)-NH<sub>2</sub>, AnaSpec 22991, MW 1548.6) is used as the fluorogenic peptide substrate. The assay buffer contains 50 mM Hepes at pH 7.5, 30 mM NaCl and 10 mM BME. The enzyme reaction is followed over a 30 minutes time course at room temperature in the absence and presence of inhibitors.</p>The peptide inhibitors HCV Inh 1 (Anaspec 25345, MW 796.8) Ac-Asp-Glu-Met-Glu-Glu-Cys-OH, [\u221220\u00b0 C.] and HCV Inh 2 (Anaspec 25346, MW 913.1) Ac-Asp-Glu-Dif-Cha-Cys-OH, are used as reference compounds.</p>IC50 values are calculated using XLFit in ActivityBase (IDBS) using equation 205:\n\ny=A+((B\u2212A)/(1+((C/x)^D))).\n</p>Example 123Cell-Based Replicon AssayQuantification of HCV replicon RNA (HCV Cell Based Assay) is accomplished using the Huh 11-7 cell line (Lohmann, et al Science 285:110-113, 1999). Cells are seeded at 4\u00d710<sup>3 </sup>cells/well in 96 well plates and fed media containing DMEM (high glucose), 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin-streptomycin and non-essential amino acids. Cells are incubated in a 7.5% CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator at 37\u00b0 C. At the end of the incubation period, total RNA is extracted and purified from cells using Ambion RNAqueous 96 Kit (Catalog No. AM1812). To amplify the HCV RNA so that sufficient material can be detected by an HCV specific probe (below), primers specific for HCV (below) mediate both the reverse transcription of the HCV RNA and the amplification of the cDNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the TaqMan One-Step RT-PCR Master Mix Kit (Applied Biosystems catalog no. 4309169). The nucleotide sequences of the RT-PCR primers, which are located in the NS5B region of the HCV genome, are the following:</p>HCV Forward primer \u201cRBNS5bfor\u201d(SEQ ID NO: 1):5\u2032GCTGCGGCCTGTCGAGCT HCV Reverse primer \u201cRBNS5Brev\u201d(SEQ ID NO 2)5\u2032CAAGGTCGTCTCCGCATAC.</p>Detection of the RT-PCR product is accomplished using the Applied Biosystems (ABI) Prism 7500 Sequence Detection System (SDS) that detects the fluorescence that is emitted when the probe, which is labeled ",
    "n on the ABI Prism 7500 Sequence Detection System are: one cycle at 95\u00b0 C., 10 minutes followed by 40 cycles each of which include one incubation at 95\u00b0 C. for 15 seconds and a second incubation for 60\u00b0 C. for 1 minute.</p>To normalize the data to an internal control molecule within the cellular RNA, RT-PCR is performed on the cellular messenger RNA glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The GAPDH copy number is very stable in the cell lines used. GAPDH RT-PCR is performed on the same RNA sample from which the HCV copy number is determined. The GAPDH primers and probes are contained in the ABI Pre-Developed TaqMan Assay Kit (catalog no. 4310884E). The ratio of HCV/GAPDH RNA is used to calculate the activity of compounds evaluated for inhibition of HCV RNA replication.</p>Activity of Compounds as Inhibitors of HCV Replication (Cell Based Assay) in Replicon Containing Huh-7 Cell Lines.</p>The effect of a specific anti-viral compound on HCV replicon RNA levels in Huh-11-7 cells is determined by comparing the amount of HCV RNA normalized to GAPDH (e.g. the ratio of HCV/GAPDH) in the cells exposed to compound versus cells exposed to the DMSO vehicle (negative control). Specifically, cells are seeded at 4\u00d710<sup>3 </sup>cells/well in a 96 well plate and are incubated either with: 1) media containing 1% DMSO (0% inhibition control), or 2) media/1% DMSO containing a fixed concentration of compound. 96 well plates as described above are then incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 4 days (EC50 determination). Percent inhibition is defined as:\n\n% Inhibition=100\u2212100*S/C1\n</p>where</p>S=the ratio of HCV RNA copy number/GAPDH RNA copy number in the sample;</p>C1=the ratio of HCV RNA copy number/GAPDH RNA copy number in the 0% inhibition control (media/1% DMSO).</p>The dose-response curve of the inhibitor is generated by adding compound in serial, three-fold dilutions over three logs to wells starting with the highest concentration of a specific compound at 1.5 uM and ending with the lowest concentration of 0.23 nM. Further dilution series (500 nM to 0.08 nM for example) is performed if the EC50 value is not positioned well on the curve. EC50 is determined with the IDBS Activity Base program \u201cXL Fit\u201d using a 4-paramater, non-linear regression fit (model #205 in version 4.2.1, build 16).</p>In the above assays, representative compounds of the present invention are found to have HCV replication inhibitory activity and HCV NS3 protease inhibitory activity. These compounds were also effective in inhibiting HCV NS3 proteases of different HCV genotypes including genotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4.</p>Representative compounds were tested in the above assays (Example 122 and Example 123). Exemplary compounds disclosed herein were found to have activities in the ranges of &lt;=0.2 nM-100 nM in the NS3/NS4a Protease Enzyme Assay and &lt;=0.2 nM-1000 nM in the Cell-Based Replicon Assay. For example, compounds of Examples 36, 101 and 117 showed IC50 of 0.1 nM, 0.4 nM and 0.2 nM in the NS3/NS4a Protease Enzyme Assay respectively, and all showed EC50 of 0.8 nM in the Cell-Based Replicon Assay.</p>Pharmacokinetic analysis of representing compounds showed high liver drug levels. For example, a single oral dose of 20 mg/kg in rat, compound of Examples 36 showed a bioavailability of 76%, with Cmax and AUC of 16.1 \u03bcg/ml and 52.9 \u03bcg\u00b7hr/ml, respectively.</p>These compounds were also tested and found no significant inhibitions of Cytochrome P450 enzymes.</p>Methods for measuring the ability of a compound to inhibit cytochrome P450 monooxygenase activity are known (see, U.S. Pat. No. 6,037,157 and Yun, et al. Drug Metabolism &amp; Disposition, vol. 21. pp. 403-407 (1993)). For example, A compound to be evaluated may be incubated with 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 mg protein/ml, or other appropriate concentration of human hepatic microsomes (e.g. commercially available, pooled characterized hepatic microsomes) for 0, 5, 10, 20, and 30 minutes, or other appropriate times, in the presence of an NADPH-generating system. Control incubations may be performed in the absence of hepatic microsomes for 0 and 30 minutes (triplicate). The samples may be analyzed for the presence of the compound. Incubation conditions that produce a linear rate of compound metabolism will be used a guide for further studies. Typical experiments would determine the kinetics of the compound's metabolism (Km and Vmax). The rate of disappearance of compound may be determined and the data analyzed according to Michaelis-Menten kinetics by using Lineweaver-Burk, Eadie-Hofs"
