    "a member of the Raf kinase family of serine/threonine-specific protein kinases. This protein plays a role in regulating the MAP kinase/ERKs signaling pathway, which affects cell \n\n division, differentiation, and secretion. A mutation of the gene has been associated with cancer in humans (Davies, H. et al., Nature, 2002, 417(6892): 949-54). </p>The compounds disclosed herein have significantly different properties to molecules such as sorafenib which are inhibitors of several tyrosine protein kinases such as VEGFR and PDGFR and of Raf kinases such as C-Raf and B-Raf. Sorafenib is used in the treatment of advanced inoperable hepatocellular cancer and advanced renal cell cancer (Iver, R. et a/., Expert Opin. Pharmacother, 2010, 11 (1 1):1943-1955). Sorafenib also interacts with B-Raf, mutants which commonly occur in human melanoma. However, cell signalling can bypass selective inhibition of B-Raf with undesirable consequences (Lo, R.S., Cell Research, advance online publication 8 May 2012; doi: 10.1038/cr.2012.78). It is therefore preferable that kinase inhibitors intended for use as anti-inflammatory medicines should have minimal potential to interact with B-Raf. In contrast to anticancer treatments such as sorafenib the compounds of the present invention possess Syk and/or c-Src inhibitory activity which is expected to promote an advantageous therapeutic profile. </p>Compounds of the present invention also display low affinity for GSK3a kinase manifested as weak activity in a binding assay or weak activity in an enzyme inhibition assay, which is considered to be beneficial in a therapeutic context, in particular in relation to minimising toxicity in vivo. </p>In at least some embodiments, compounds of the present invention have p59-HCK inhibitory activity which may also augment their advantageous therapeutic profile. </p>Detailed description of the invention </p>Alkyl as used herein refers to straight chain or branched chain alkyl, such as, without limitation, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, butyl, n-butyl and tert-butyl. In one embodiment alkyl refers to straight chain alkyl. </p>Alkoxy as used herein refers to straight or branched chain alkoxy, for example methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy. Alkoxy as employed herein also extends to embodiments in which the oxygen atom is located within the alkyl chain, for example -Ci<sub>-3</sub> alkylOCi.<sub>3</sub> alkyl, such as -CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OCH3 or -CH<sub>2</sub>OCH3. Thus in one embodiment the alkoxy is linked through carbon to the remainder of the molecule. In one embodiment the alkoxy is linked through oxygen to the remainder of the molecule, for example -OCi.<sub>6</sub> alkyl. In one embodiment the disclosure relates to straight chain alkoxy. </p>Halo or halogen includes fluoro, chloro, bromo or iodo, in particular fluoro, chloro or bromo, especially fluoro or chloro. \n\n Alkyl substituted by halo (haloalkyl) as employed herein refers to alkyl groups having 1 to 6 halogen atoms, fo",

Protective groups and the means for their removal are described in \"Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis\", by Theodora W. Greene and Peter G. M. Wuts, published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc; 4th Rev Ed., 2006, ISBN-10: 0471697540. </p>Novel intermediates as described herein form an aspect of the invention. Compounds of formula (I) are p38 MAP kinase inhibitors (especially of the alpha subtype) and in one aspect the compounds are useful in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, for example COPD and/or asthma. </p>Surprisingly, in at least some embodiments, the compounds of formula (I) exhibit a long duration of action and/or persistence of action in comparison to other previously disclosed allosteric p38 MAP kinase inhibitors such as, for example, BIRB796 (Pargellis, C et ai. , Nature Struct. Biol., 2002, 9(4):268-272). </p>In one embodiment the compounds of formula (I) exhibit very low inhibitory activity against GSK 3a, for example they have an IC<sub>50</sub> value against GSK 3a of 1500 nM or greater; such as 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000, 7,000, 8,000, 9,000 or 10,000 nM or greater. </p>Persistence of action as used herein is related to the dissociation rate or dissociation constant of the compound from the target (such as a receptor). A low dissociation rate may lead to persistence. </p>A low dissociation rate in combination with a high association rate tends to provide potent therapeutic entities. The compounds of formula (I) are expected to be potent in vivo. </p>Typically, the prior art compounds developed to date have been intended for oral administration. This strategy involves optimizing the pharmacokinetic profile of drug substances in order to achieve an adequate duration of action. In this manner a sufficiently \n\n high drug concentration is established and maintained between doses to provide sustained clinical benefit. The inevitable consequence of this approach is that all bodily tissues, and especially the liver and the gut, are likely to be exposed to supra-therapeutically active concentrations of the drug, whether or not they are adversely affected by the disease being treated. </p>An alternative strategy is to design treatment paradigms in which the drug is dosed directly to the inflamed organ, that is, to exploit topical administration. Whilst this approach is not suitable for treating all chronic inflammatory diseases, it has been exploited in lung disorders, such as asthma and COPD; in skin diseases, for example against atopic dermatitis and psoriasis; for nasal conditions, typified by allergic rhinitis; and in gastrointestinal diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and inflammatory diseases of th",

The supernatant is harvested for determination of IL-8 and TNFa concentrations by sandwich ELISA (Duo-set, R&amp;D systems) and read on the fluorescence microplate reader (Varioskan\u00ae Flash, ThermoFisher Scientific). The concentration at 50% inhibition (IC<sub>50</sub>) of IL-8 and TNFa production is calculated from the dose response curve. </p>(c) IL-2 release in CD3/CD28 stimulated PBMC cells </p>PBMCs from healthy subjects are separated from whole blood using a density gradient (Lymphoprep, Axis-Shield Healthcare). Cells are added to a 96 well plate pre-coated with a mixture of CD3/CD38 monoclonal antibodies (0.3ug/ml eBioscience and 3ug/ml BD Pharmingen respectively). Compound at the desired concentration is then added to the wells and the plate left for 3 days under normal tissue culture conditions. Supernatants are harvested and IL-2 release determined by Sandwich ELISA (Duo-set, R&amp;D System). The IC<sub>5</sub>o is determined from the dose response curve. </p>(d) IL-W-induced IL-8 release in HT29 cells </p> HT29 cells, a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, are plated in a 96 well plate (24hrs) and pre-treaied with compounds at the desired concentration for 2 hours before addition of 5ng/ml of IL-\u0399 \u03b2 (Abeam) for 24 hours. Supernatants are harvested for IL-8 quantification by Sandwich ELISA (Duo-set, R&amp;D System). The IC50 is determined from the dose response curve. (e) LPS-induced IL-8 and TNFa Release in Primary Macrophages </p> PBMCs from healthy subjects are separated from whole blood using a density gradient (Lymphoprep, Axis-Shield Healthcare). Cells incubated for 2hrs and non-adherent cells removed by washing. To differentiate the cells to macrophages the cells are incubated with 5ng/ml of GM-CSF (Peprotech) for 7 days under normal tissue culture conditions. Compounds are then added to the cells at the desired concentration for a 2 hour pre- treatment before stimulation with 10 ng/ml LPS for 24 hours. Supernatants are harvested and IL-8 and TNFa release determined by Sandwich ELISA (Duo-set, R&amp;D System). The IC50 is determined from the dose response curve. (f) Poly l:C-induced ICAM-1 Expression in BEAS2B Cells </p>Poly l:C is used in these studies as a simple, RNA virus mimic. Poly l:C-Oligofectamine mixture (1 pg/mL Poly l:C, \u00b1 2% Oligofectamine, 25 uL) (Invivogen Ltd., San Diego, CA, and Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, respectively) is transfected into BEAS2B cells (human bronchial epithelial cells, ATCC). Cells are pre-incubated with final concentrations of test compounds for 2 hr and the level of ICAM1 expression on the cell surface is determined by cell-based ELISA. At a time point 18 hr after poly l:C transfection, cells are fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS (100 pL) and then endogenous peroxidase is quenched by the addition of washing buffer (100 pL, 0.05% Tween in PBS: PBS-Tween) containing 0.1 % sodium azide and 1 % \n\n hydrogen peroxide. Cells are washed with wash-buffer (3 x 200 \u03bc\u0399_). and after blocking the wells with 5% milk in PBS-Tween (100 \u03bc\u0399_) for 1 hr, the cells are incubated with anti-human ICAM-1 antibody (50 \u03bc\u0399_) (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) in 1 % BSA PBS overnight at 4\u00b0C. </p>The cells are washed with PBS-Tween (3 x 200 \u03bc\u0399_) and incubated with the secondary antibody (100 \u03bc\u0399_) (HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, Dako Ltd., Glostrup, Denmark). The cells are then incubated with of substrate (50 \u03bc\u0399_) for 2-20min, followed by the addtion of stop solution (50 \u03bc\u0399_, 1 N H<sub>2</sub>S0<sub>4</sub>).The ICAM-1 signal is detected by reading and reading the absorbanc"
