    "IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1 and IgA2) or any subclass (for example IgG2a and IgG2b), and antibody needs not to be any specific type, classification or subclass.In certain embodiments of the invention, antibody is IgG antibody or its classification or subclass.Antibody can be from any animal-origin, comprises birds and Mammals (for example people, mouse, donkey, sheep, rabbit, goat, cavy, camel, horse or chicken).\n      </p>\" recombinant antibodies \" comprises the antibody of being prepared, express, producing or separated by recombination method, the antibody that the combinatorial antibody library that for example uses transfection to the antibody of the recombinant expression vector expression of host cell, certainly to recombinate separates, the antibody for example, separating from the animal (mouse or ox) of human immunoglobulin gene's transgenosis and/or transfection chromosome; Or by relating to, immunoglobulin gene sequence is cut into any other method preparation of other DNA sequence dna, the antibody of expressing, producing or separating.</p>\" monoclonal antibody \" refers to from a group homology or the antibody roughly obtaining in the antibody of homology.Each monoclonal antibody is generally identified the single epi-position of antigen.In many-side of the present invention, monoclonal antibody is the antibody being produced by single hybridoma or other cell, only with thyroid carcinoma mark specific binding, as for example measuring by ELISA or other antigen binding assay known in the art or competition binding assay.This term is not limited to the concrete grammar for the preparation of antibody, and for example they can produce by hybridoma method, maybe can adopt means known in the art to separate from phage library.</p>Comprise that mono-clonal and polyclonal antibody, fragment and chimeric antibody can adopt method preparation well known to the skilled person.Can utilize natural polypeptides thyroid carcinoma mark or the recombinant polypeptide thyroid carcinoma mark Dispersal risk of separation.For the preparation of monoclonal antibody referring to (1975) Nature 256:495-497 such as such as Kohler; Kozbor etc. (1985) J.Immunol Methods 81:31-42; (1984) Mol Cell Biol62:109-120 such as Cote etc. (1983) Proc Natl Acad Sci 80:2026-2030 and Cole; For the preparation of mono-clonal Fab fragment referring to (1989) Science246:1275-1281 such as Huse; And for identifying that the phagemid of antibody or the preparation in bone-marrow-derived lymphocyte immunoglobulin (Ig) library are referring to Pound (1998) Immunochemical Protocols, Humana Press, Totowa, N.J.There is the specific antibody also can be available from science or commercial source to polypeptide thyroid carcinoma mark.In one embodiment of the invention, if the K of their combinations\n        <sub>a</sub>be more than or equal to 10\n        <sup>-7</sup>m, antibody has the reactivity for polypeptide thyroid carcinoma mark.\n      </p>EpCAM polypeptide is had to the example of specific antibody in table 1.</p>\" state "
