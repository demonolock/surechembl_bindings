    "sent invention provides a composition of matter selected from: a substantially pure or recombinant DCRS2 polypeptide comprising at least three distinct nonoverlapping segments of at least four amino acids identical to segments of SEQ ID NO: 2; a substantially pure or recombinant DCRS2 polypeptide comprising at least two distinct nonoverlapping segments of at least five amino acids identical to segments of SEQ ID NO: 2; a natural sequence DCRS2 comprising mature SEQ ID NO: 2; or a fusion polypeptide comprising DCRS2 sequence. In certain embodiment, the invention embraces such a substantially pure or isolated antigenic DCRS2 polypeptide, wherein the distinct nonoverlapping segments of identity: include one of at least eight amino acids; include one of at least four amino acids and a second of at least five amino acids; include at least three segments of at least four, five, and six amino acids, or include one of at least twelve amino acids. Other embodiments include wherein the: DCRS2 polypeptide: comprises a mature sequence of Table 1; is an unglycosylated form of DCRS2; is from a primate, such as a human; comprises at least seventeen amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 2; exhibits at least four nonoverlapping segments of at least seven amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 2; is a natural allelic variant of DCRS2; has a length at least about 30 amino acids; exhibits at least two non-overlapping epitopes which are specific for a primate DCRS2; is glycosylated; has a molecular weight of at least 30 kD with natural glycosylation; is a synthetic polypeptide; is attached to a solid substrate; is conjugated to another chemical moiety; is a 5-fold or less substitution from natural sequence; or is a deletion or insertion variant from a natural sequence. Still other embodiments include a composition comprising: a substantially pure DCRS2 and another Interferon Receptor family member; a sterile DCRS2 polypeptide; the DCRS2 polypeptide and a carrier, wherein the carrier is: an aqueous compound, including water, saline, and/or buffer; and/or formulated for oral, rectal, nasal, topical, or parenteral administration. Fusion polypeptide embodiments include those comprising: mature protein sequence of Table 1; a detection or purification tag, including a FLAG, His6, or Ig sequence; or sequence of another interferon receptor protein. Kit embodiments include those comprising such a polypeptide, and: a compartment comprising the protein or polypeptide; or instructions for use or disposal of reagents in the kit.</p>\n  Binding compound embodiments include, e.g., a binding compound comprising an antigen binding site from an antibody, which specifically binds to a natural DCRS2 polypeptide, wherein: the binding compound is in a container; the DCRS2 polypeptide is from a human; the binding compound is an Fv, Fab, or Fab2 fragment; the binding compound is conjugated to another chemical moiety; or the antibody: is raised against a peptide sequence of a mature polypeptide of Table 1; is raised against a mature DCRS2; is raised to a purified human DCRS2; is immunoselected; is a polyclonal antibody; binds to a denatured DCRS2; exhibits a Kd to antigen of at least 30 \u00b5M; is attached to a solid substrate, including a bead or plastic membrane; is in a sterile composition; or is detectably labeled, including a radioactive or fluorescent label. Kits include those comprising the binding compound, and: a compartment comprising the binding compound; or instructions for use or disposal of reagents in the kit.</p>\n  Methods are provided, e.g., of producing an antigen:antibody complex, comprising contacting under appropriate conditions a primate DCRS2 polypeptide with a described antibody, thereby allowing the complex to form. This includes wherein: the complex is purified from other interferon receptors; the complex is purified from other antibody; the contacting is with a sample comprising an interferon; the contacting allows quantitative detection of the antigen; the contacting is with a sample comprising the antibody; or the contacting allows quantitative detection of the antibody.</p>\n  Various related compositions are provided, e.g., a composition comprising: a sterile binding compound, as described, or the described binding compound and a carrier, wherein the carrier is: an aqueous compound, including water, saline, and/or buffer; and/or formulated for oral, rectal, nasal, topical, or parenteral administration.</p>\n  Nucleic acid embodiments include, e.g., an isolated or recombinant nucleic acid encoding the DCRS2 polypeptide, wherein the: DCRS2 is from a human; or the nucleic acid: encodes an antigenic peptide s"
