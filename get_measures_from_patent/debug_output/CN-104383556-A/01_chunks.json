    "enter described here for the treatment of effective dose is used can to comprise single therapy or a series for the treatment of.</p>The dosage of compound, toxicity and treatment effect can be determined, such as, by the standard pharmaceutical operation in cell culture or laboratory animal, such as, for measuring those of LD50 (dosage that the colony to 50% is lethal) and ED50 (the effective dosage of the mass treatment to 50%).Dose ratio between poisonous and therapeutic effect is therapeutic index, and it can be represented as the ratio of LD50/ED50.The compound presenting high therapeutic index is preferred.When use present the compound of toxic side effects time, delivery system should be designed carefully, described delivery system by these targeting compounds infected tissue to minimize the potential damage to non-infected cells, thus reduce side effect.</p>The data obtained from cell culture assays and zooscopy can be used to prepare the dosage range for the mankind.The dosage of these compounds is preferably in and comprises very little or do not have within the scope of the circulation composition of virose ED50.Depend on the dosage form of employing and the route of administration of use, dosage can change within the scope of this.For any compound used in the method for the invention, can primitively estimate to treat effective dose from cell culture assays.Can in animal model, prepare dosage reach the circulating plasma concentration range being included in the IC50 (that is, reaching the concentration of the test compounds of half maximum suppression of symptom) measured in cell culture.This Information Availability is in measuring dosage useful in the mankind more accurately.Can by the level in such as Plasma By Hplc.</p>Information more specifically about dosage is hereafter being discussed.</p>Polypeptide and micromolecularly to use</p>If expected, the reagent crossing over blood brain barrier can be used capapie.Alternatively, reagent is polypeptide described here and micromolecule such as, can directly be delivered to wherein cell show \u03b1 S accumulate health in site.The reagent not crossing over blood brain barrier can such as utilize the direct injection carrying out judicial convenience by location, brain domain (stereotactic) guiding to be administered to brain.Such reagent can also be used via ICV (intraventricular) or intraparenchymatous (intraparenchymal) approach.</p>In other embodiments, the nucleic acid molecules of the polypeptide of coding expectation can be sent with the form of the viral vector such as containing polypeptide coding genes.Viral delivery can under certain condition, and described condition is conducive to the expression of transgenic in specific maincenter or peripheral nerve-cell, such as, at ependyma or other glial cells of ventricles of the brain lining.Ependymocyte can be transduceed express transgenic and being secreted in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by the protein of coding.</p>Polypeptide descri"
