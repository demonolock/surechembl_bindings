Then dilutions of purified antibodies in PBS/0.05% Tween20/0.5% BSA were incubated for 1 h. After adding a mixture of 3 ng/ml hu CSF-1 (active 149 aa fragment of human CSF-1 (aa 33-181 of SEQ ID NO: 86) ;Biomol, DE, Cat.No.60530), 50ng/ml biotinylated anti CSF-1 clone BAF216 (R&amp;D Systems,UK) and 1:5000 diluted streptavidin HRP (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, DE, Cat.No.11089153001) for 1 h the plates were washed 6 times with PBST. Anti CSF-1R SC 2-4A5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, US), which inhibits the ligand- receptor interaction, was used as positive control. Plates were developed with freshly prepared BM blue\u00ae POD substrate solution (BM blue\u00ae: 3,3'-5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, DE, Cat.No. 11484281001) for 30 minutes at RT. Absorbance was measured at 370 nm.A decrease of absorbance is found, if the anti-CSF-1R antibody causes a release of CSF-1 from the dimeric complex. All anti-CSF-1R antibodies showed significant inhibition of the CSF-1 interaction with CSF-1R (see Table 1).

For detection of the phosphorylated receptor the kit from R&amp;D Systems (Cat. No. DYC3268-2) was used according to the instructions of the supplier. For detection of total CSF-1R 10 \u00b5l of the lysate was immobilized on plate by use of the capture antibody contained in the kit.
