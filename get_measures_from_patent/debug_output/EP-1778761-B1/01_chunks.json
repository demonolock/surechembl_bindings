    "ses, the tendency for the side chains to be crystallizable tends to decrease. Similarly, as the length of the side chains decrease, the tendency for the side chains to be crystallizable also tends to decrease. Thus, certain embodiments of polymers comprising a recurring unit of the formula (I) do not include the side chain crystallizable polymers described in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 11/176,638, filed July 7, 2005</patcit> (published as US 2006/0024266 A1</patcit>).</p>Monomer and Polymer Syntheses: The polymers described herein (including, e.g, polymers comprising a recurring unit of the Formula (I)) may be synthesized by various conventional reactions known in the art. For example, Synthetic Schemes 1-3 illustrate the preparation of halogenated phenolic monomers useful for the making polymers of the Formula (I).\n<img id=\"ib0030\" path=\"imgb0030.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/874574150/EP/20210929/B1/000001/77/87/61/imgb0030.tif\"/>\n<img id=\"ib0031\" path=\"imgb0031.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/874574151/EP/20210929/B1/000001/77/87/61/imgb0031.tif\"/>\n<img id=\"ib0032\" path=\"imgb0032.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/874574152/EP/20210929/B1/000001/77/87/61/imgb0032.tif\"/></p>In Synthetic Schemes 1-3 above, X is a halogen, the halogen is iodo or bromo. Halogenation may be performed by conventional reactions known in the art. For instance, iodination may be performed on aryl rings by treatment with KI, ICl, IF, benzyltrimethylammonium dichloroiodate, or I<sub>2</sub> in the presence of copper salts. Likewise, bromination may be performed on aryl rings by treatment with bromine in the presence of a catalyst, such as iron. Other brominating reagents include HOBr and bromo amides. The coupling of the acid and the amine illustrated in Synthetic Schemes 1-3 may also be performed by conventional reactions in known in the art. Standard coupling reagents, including EDCI, HBTU, and HOBt, may be used for activation of the reactants.</p>The resulting halogenated phenolic monomers may then be polymerized to form various linkages e.g., polymers having phosphate linkages, such as poly(phosphates) and poly(phosphonates). The respective structures of these classes of polymers, each having a different side chain connected to the phosphorus atom, are as follows:\n<img id=\"ib0033\" path=\"imgb0033.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/874574153/EP/20210929/B1/000001/77/87/61/imgb0033.tif\"/>\n<img id=\"ib0034\" path=\"imgb0034.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/874574154/EP/20210929/B1/000001/77/87/61/imgb0034.tif\"/></p>The versatility of these polymers may come from the versatility of the phosphorus atom, which is known for a multiplicity of reactions. Its bonding may involve the 3p orbitals or various 3s-3p hybrids; spd hybrids are also possible because of the accessible d orbitals. Thus, the physico-chemical properties of the poly(phosphoesters) may be re",
    "n reaction. Thus, even nominally pure reagent-grade or analytical-grade solvents, and particularly THF, may contain residual water, stabilizers such as butylated hydroxy toluene and peroxides. These contaminants, even in minor amounts, may interfere with the solution polymerization reaction. Among the broad class of catalysts suggested for solution polymerization synthesis of polyiminocarbonates, the metal hydroxides, metal alkoxides and metal hydrides, and particularly the alkali metal hydroxides and alkoxides, provide markedly superior results. THF and acetone are preferred solvents.</p>Interfacial polymerization processes may also be used for production of polyiminocarbonates. For instance, an interfacial polymerization process may include the steps of admixing an aqueous solution of the halogenated phenolic monomer and a basic catalyst with a solution of cyanogen bromide in a water-immiscible organic solvent by progressively adding the aqueous solution to the solution of cyanogen bromide in organic solvent while mixing, and recovering the resulting polyiminocarbonate. The order of addition may be significant, and the rate of addition may also be significant.</p>The reactions in the above synthetic schemes may be carried through with the non-halogenated versions. Subsequently, halogenation of the polymer may be carried out. Halogenation may be performed by conventional reactions in known in the art. For instance, iodination may be performed on aryl rings by treatment with KI, ICl, IF, benzyltrimethylammonium dichloroiodate, or I2 in the presence of copper salts. For instance, bromination may be performed on aryl rings by treatment with bromine in the presence of a catalyst, such as iron. Other brominating reagents include HOBr and bromo amides. Halogenation of the polymer may be non-selective, which is within the scope of the embodiments.</p>Starting materials described herein are available commercially, are known, or may be prepared by methods known in the art. Additionally, starting materials not described herein are available commercially, are known, or may be prepared by methods known in the art.</p>Starting materials may have the appropriate substituents to ultimately give desired products with the corresponding substituents. Alternatively, substituents may be added at any point of synthesis to ultimately give desired products with the corresponding substituents.</p>The synthetic schemes show methods that may be used to prepare the compounds of preferred embodiments. One skilled in the art will appreciate that a number of different synthetic reaction schemes may be used to synthesize the compounds of preferred embodiments. Further, one skilled in the art will understand that a number of different solvents, coupling agents and reaction conditions may be used in the syntheses reactions to yield comparable results.</p>One skilled in the art will appreciate variations in the sequence and, further, will recognize variations in the appropriate "
