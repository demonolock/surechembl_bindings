    "n reported that normal mitochondria have a polymorphism, and the polymorphism may accumulate depending on a disease. Accordingly, we studied whether to be able to recognize a mitochondrial polymorphism and induce cell death, as in the above sections of this Example, in cells of healthy persons having normal mitochondria in which polymorphism accumulated. Lung cancer A549 cells have a mtDNA A14582G polymorphism. CCC021-TPP of the following formula (XIII) was synthesized by the method described in the preceding section \"Synthesis of CCC020-TPP\" (Figure 13).\n<img id=\"ib0036\" path=\"imgb0036.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/910861121/EP/20220126/A1/000003/94/31/58/imgb0036.tif\"/></p>The proliferation suppressive effect of CCC021-TPP on cells having the A14582G mtDNA mutation was evaluated by WST assay.

The observation was performed for 8 days under the culture conditions described above (both the mtDNA mutation cell line A549 and the PC14 cell line having no mutation were inoculated at 1 \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup> cells/well, cultured for 24 hours, and then treated with CCC021-TPP (final concentration: 20 \u00b5M)), and cell numbers were counted.</p>As shown in Figure 15, a significantly small cell number and significant suppression of proliferation were observed in A549 treated with CCC021-TPP, whereas neither significant difference in cell number nor a cell proliferation suppressive effect was found in PC14. This suggested that CCC021-TPP dominantly induces cell death in a cancer cell line having the target mitochondrial DNA sequence, cannot induce cell death in a cancer cell line having no target mitochondrial DNA sequence, and induces cell death in cancer cells in a mitochondrial mutant sequence-specific manner.</p>[Example 2] Synthetic lethality experimentPrior to the experiment, whether CCC021-TPP was localized in mitochondria in the cultured cell lines A549 and PC14 was examined by immunostaining using Mito Tracker RED and an anti-TPP antibody. The A549 cells and the PC14 cells were inoculated at 5 \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup> cells/dish and 1 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> cells/dish, respectively, to 35 mm glass base dishes (IWAKI, Japan), cultured for 24 hours, and then treated with CCC021-TPP (final concentration: 20 \u00b5M). Further, 24 hours later, the culture solution was discarded, and a DMEM culture solution containing Mito Tracker(R) Red CMXRos (Life Technologies, USA) was added to attain 100 nM. 30 minutes later, the cells were washed twice with PBS, then fixed in 4% PFA for 30 minutes, then medium-replaced with PBS, preserved at 4\u00b0C, immunostained with the antibody by the method described in Example 1, and observed under confocal laser microscope SP8 (Leica, Germany). As a result, TPP and Mito Tracker RED were colocalized, revealing that CCC021-TPP was retained in mitochondria (Figure 16). A549 and PC14 were each inoculated at 5 \u00d7 10<sup>2</sup> cells/well to 16 wells of a 96-well plate, cultured for 24 hours, and then treated with CCC021-TPP at 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, and 50 \u00b5M each for 2 wells. 5 days later, the cells were reacted at room temperature for 2 hours using CytoSelect(TM) MTT Cell Proliferation Assay (Cosmo Bio Co., Ltd.), followed by the measurement of absorbance at 590 nm with SPECTRAFLUOR Plus (Tecan Group Ltd.) to conduct a rechallenge experiment of cell proliferation. As a result, IC50 was 7.97 \u00b5M for A549 and was incalculable for PC14, as shown in the results of MTT assay shown in Figure 17 (Figure 17). Furthermore, the A549 cells exhibited cell morphology that appeared as senescent morphology, which were characteristic morphology in which, after CCC021-TPP administration, the cells were enlarged, distorted, and formed numerous vacuoles within the cells (Figure 18). 7 days later, as for change in the live cell numbers of the A549 cells and the PC14 cells, the live cell numbers were measured by trypan blue staining to experimentally examine cell survival rates. The trypan blue assay revealed no influence on the viability of both the A549 cells and the PC14 cells (Figure 19), suggesting that CCC021-TPP influenced the cell proliferation of the A549 cells without exhibiting the ability to kill cells. In short, CCC021-TPP suppressed the cell proliferation of A549, though neither change in the number of live cells nor induction of cell death was found, suggesting the possibility of cellular senescence.</p>In order to study whether cellular senescence was induced, the activity of a senescence marker \u03b2-galactosidase was determined with SPiDER-P-Gal (DOINDO) in the A549 cells and the PC14 cells after CCC021-TPP administration. 1000 cells were inoculated to a 35 mm dish and then cultured for 24 hours. Then, CCC021-TPP was administered (final concentration: 20 \u00b5M), and the cells were cultured for 5 days, washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) (pH",
