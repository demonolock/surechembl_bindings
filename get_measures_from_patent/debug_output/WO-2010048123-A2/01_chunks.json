(2006) Cell 125:733-747; mTOR inhibitors that are dual inhibitors of mTOR kinase and one or more other PIKK (or PIK-related) kinase family members. Such members include MECl, TELl, RAD3, MEI-41, DNA-PK, ATM, ATR, TRRAP, PI3K, and PI4K kinases; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors; protein kinase C inhibitors; PI-3 kinase inhibitors; and PDK-I inhibitors (see Dancey, J. and Sausville, E.A.

No. 5,747,498; International Patent Publication No. WO 01/34574, and Moyer, J.D. et al. (1997) Cancer Res. 57:4838-4848); CI-1033 (formerly known as PD183805; Pfizer) (Sherwood et al., 1999, Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 40:723); PD-158780 (Pfizer); AG-1478 (University of California); CGP-59326 (Novartis); PKI-166 (Novartis); EKB-569 (Wyeth); GW-2016 (also known as GW-572016 or lapatinib ditosylate ; GSK); gefitinib (also known as ZD1839 or IRESSA\u2122; Astrazeneca) (Woodburn et al., 1997, Proc.

A particularly preferred low molecular weight EGFR kinase inhibitor that can be used according to the present invention is [6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)-4-quinazolin-4-yl]-(3- ethynylphenyl) amine (i.e. erlotinib), its hydrochloride salt (i.e. erlotinib HCl, TARCEVA\u2122), or other salt forms (e.g. erlotinib mesylate). Antibody-based EGFR kinase inhibitors include any anti-EGFR \n\n antibody or antibody fragment that can partially or completely block EGFR activation by its natural ligand. Non- limiting examples of antibody -based EGFR kinase inhibitors include those described in Modjtahedi, H., et al., 1993, Br. J. Cancer 67:247-253; Teramoto, T., et al., 1996, Cancer 77:639-645; Goldstein et al., 1995, Clin. Cancer Res. 1 : 1311-1318; Huang, S.

    "to PQIP in combination with SN-38, Oxaliplatin or 5-FU. In all combinations, cells were seeded in 96-well flat bottomed plates and left overnight. PQIP and chemotherapy were both added for 72 hours. The results of the combinations were analyzed by the Chou and Talalay method with Calcusyn (Biosoft, Ferguson, MO). \n\n [339] Detection of IGFlR using Meso Scale Discovery assays (MSD): HT29 and HCTl 16 CRC cell lines were seeded into 6-well plates, allowed to attach for 24 hours and exposed to PQIP and chemotherapy (SN38, or Oxaliplatin) alone or in combination for 72h. Following exposure, cells were rinsed with PBS and scraped into RIPA lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors, EDTA, NaF, and sodium orthovanadate. Total protein was quantified using the BioRad Dc Protein Assay (BioRad, Hercules, CA). Fifty micrograms of protein in 25 \u03bcL was added per well for MSD detection of phosphorylated IGF-IR according to manufacturer's instructions (Meso Scale Discovery, Gaithersburg, MD).</p>[340] Results</p>[341] CRC cell lines exhibit a range of sensitivities to the IGF-IR kinase inhibitor PQIP: The sensitivity of 26 colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines to growth inhibition by the IGF-IR kinase inhibitor PQIP was tested using a sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay (see Figure 1 for characteristics of the cell lines tested.). The CRC cell lines were treated with a range of concentrations of PQIP (from 0.05-5 \u03bcM) for 72 hours. As shown in Figure 2 the majority of the cell lines failed to reach an IC50 up to 5 \u03bcmol/L, but a clear distinction could be made between the cell lines that were sensitive (i.e. cell lines Colo205, HT29, Colo320, and LS513, with IC50 &lt; 0.5 \u03bcmol/L) and the cell lines that were resistant (HCTl 16, HCT15, SW480, RKO, LS1034, CaCo2, HCT8, LoVo, LS123, T84, LS174T, LS180, SW1417, SWl 116, SW48, NCI-H508, SW948, SW837, SW1463, SW403, with IC50 &gt;5 umol/L). Several cell lines were of intermediate sensitivity (e.g. SW620, Colo201, SK-CO-I).</p>[342] Differential Gene Expression Between PQIP-Sensitive and PQIP -Resistant CRC Cell Lines: To determine the genes associated with sensitivity or resistance to PQIP treatment, the gene expression profiles of PQIP -untreated samples of the 4 most sensitive (S) and the 5 most resistant (R) CRC cell lines were examined. This gene profile was generated by analyzing the differential expression of PQIP -resistant and PQIP-sensitive CRC cell lines. RNA was prepared from the nine cell lines using Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays. Using previously published methods, we were able to identify 110 genes that were significant at the p&lt; 0.005 level of univariate significance, using a two-sample T-test (Figure 14 and 15). Top scoring genes (i.e. p&lt;0.0015) included caldesmon (CALDl), several metallothioneins (e.g. MT-IE), aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDHlAl), and mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 6 (MAP2K6). \n\n [343] Caldesmon was expressed at high levels in R tumor cells (61 -fold increased in R cells, p=0.0002; Figures 4A and 15). Caldesmon is an actin-binding protein that has recently been shown to play a critical role in regulating the formation and dynamics of podosomes and invadopodia, cell adhesion structures that protrude from the plasma membrane and degrade the extracellular matrix (ECM), thus promoting cancer cell invasion (Linder, S. and Aepfelbacher, M.

    "performed on one sensitive cell line with miR-181a and miR-224 antagonists and one resistant cell line with miR- 181a and miR-224 mimic. The cells were \n\n transfected in 60mm dishes for 24 hours, after which the samples were plated into 96-well plates, and treated with different doses of OSI906 (5\u03bcM-0.075\u03bcM). The results were analyzed using SRB. The remainder of the samples transfected with miR-224 was plated in 60mm dishes and qRT-PCR was performed. The miRNAs profiled, and their encoding genes, are described in Table 2b.. The sequences and other details of the probed miRNAs can be found at any of a number of online databases, including the Sanger miRNA database \"miRBase\", located at http ://microrna.sanger. ac.uk/; and the NCBI Entrez Gene database (National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), U.S. National Library of Medicine, 8600 Rockville Pike, Building 38A, Bethesda, MD 20894; Internet address http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).</p>[382] Results and Discussion</p>[383] Assessment of responsiveness of a panel of CRC cell lines to OSI-906. In order to assess CRC cell lines with differential sensitivity to OSI-906, a panel of 27 CRC cell lines were exposed to increasing concentrations of OSI-906 and proliferation was measured using the SRB assay as described previously ( Pitts, TM, et al. MoI Cancer Ther 2009;8(2):342-9). As depicted in Figure 17 there was a wide range of sensitivity of the CRC cell lines to OSI-906, the majority of the cell lines failing to reach an IC50 up to 5 \u03bcmol/L, but a clear distinction could be made between the cell lines that were sensitive and the cell lines that were resistant. For classification, a sensitive cell line was classified as one with an IC<sub>5</sub>O &lt; 1.5 \u03bcmol/L, whereas resistant cell lines had IC<sub>5</sub>O of &gt;5 \u03bcmol/L. Six CRC cell lines from this panel met the criteria as being sensitive (i.e. Colo205, GEO, LS513, HT29, CaCo2 and LS 1034), and the remaining 21 were resistant (i.e. Colo201, SK-CO-I, SW948, SW48, NCI-H508, HCTl 16, HCT15, SW480, RKO, , HCT8, LoVo, LS123, T84, LS174T, LS180, SW1417, SWI l 16, SW837, SW1463, SW620 and SW403).</p>[384] Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of CRC cell lines for IGF-IR gene copy number. Since previous studies have suggested that increased EGFR copy number may be predictive for EGFR-directed agents, we assessed IGF-IR gene copy number in the panel of cell lines (Hirsch FR, et al. J Clin Oncol 2008;26(20):3351-7). Using an IGF-IR specific probe, twenty-seven CRC cell lines with differing sensitivities to the IGF-IR inhibitor OSI-906 were subjected to FISH analysis. Although IGF-IR gene amplification was not observed in any of the CRC cell lines, several of them displayed an unbalanced gain (based upon ploidy) of IGF-IR copy number, with a trend (p= 0.17) towards a relationship between the presence of unbalanced gain and sensitivity (Table 3). Representative spreads/interphase nuclei are depicted in Figure 18 for a sensitive (18A",
