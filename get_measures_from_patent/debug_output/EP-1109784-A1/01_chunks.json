    "be made without departing from the scope of the invention. \n\nEXPERIMENTAL</p>\n  Assay Procedures</p>\n  1. Binding to serotonin receptors</p>\n  The binding of compounds of formula (I) to serotonin receptors was determined in vitro by standard methods. The preparations were investigated in accordance with the assays given hereinafter.</p>\n  Method (a): For the binding to the 5-HT<sub>2</sub>c receptor the 5-HT<sub>2</sub>c receptors were radiolabeled with [<sup>3</sup>H]-5-HT. The affinity of the compounds for 5-HT<sub>2</sub>c receptors in a CHO cell line was determined according to the procedure of D. Hoyer, G. Engel and H.O. Kalkman, European J. Pharmacol, 1985, 118, 13-23.</p>\n  Method (b): For the binding to the 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor the 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors were radiolabeled with [<sup>3</sup>H]-5-HT. The affinity of the compounds for human 5-HT<sub>2</sub>B receptors in a CHO cell line was determined according to the procedure of K. Schmuck, C. Ullmer, P. Engels and H. Lubbert, FEBSLett., 1994, 342, 85-90.</p>\n  Method (c): For the binding to the 5-HT<sub>2</sub>A receptor the 5-HT <sub>A</sub> receptors were radiolabeled with [<sup>125</sup>I]-DOI. The affinity of the compounds for 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors in a CHO cell line was determined according to the procedure of D. J. McKenna and S. J. Peroutka, J. Neurosci., 1989, 9, 3482-90.</p>\n  The thus determined activity of compounds of formula (I) is shown in Table 1. \n\n</p>\n  Table 1</p>\n  Compound K (2C) Ki (2B) Ki (2A)</p>\n  Example 1 357 nM 113 nM 405 nM</p>\n  Example 10 55 nM 138 nM 252 nM</p>\n  Example 12 77 nM 42 nM 1092 nM</p>\n  Example 13 122 nM 175 nM 461 nM</p>\n  Example 22 260 nM 92 nM 325 nM</p>\n  Example 24 235 nM 148 nM 1866 nM</p>\n  Example 25 63 nM 22 nM 156 nM</p>\n  Example 26 1156 nM 761 nM 1262 nM</p>\n  Example 50 61 nM 159 nM 332 nM</p>\n  Example 51 165 nM 140 nM 1113 nM</p>\n  2. Functional activity</p>\n  The functional activity of compounds of formula (I) was assayed using a Fluorimetric Imaging Plate reader (FLIPR). CHO cells expressing the human 5-HT<sub>2</sub>c or human 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors were counted and plated into standard 96 well microtitre plates on the day before testing to give a confluent monolayer. The cells were then dye loaded with the calcium sensitive dye, Fluo-3-AM. Unincorporated dye was removed using an automated cell washer to leave a total volume of 100 \u03bcL/well of assay buffer (Hanks balanced salt solution containing 20 mM Hepes and 2.5 mM probenecid). The drug (dissolved in 50 \u03bcL of the assay buffer) was added at a rate of 70 \u03bcL/sec to each well of the FLIPR 96 well plate during fluorescence measurements. The measurements were taken at 1 sec intervals and the maximum fluorescent signal was measured (approx 10- 15 sees after drug addition) and compared with the response produced by 10 \u03bcM 5-HT (defined as 100%) to which it was expressed as a percentage response (relative efficacy). Dose response curves were constructed using Graphpad "
