    "icum species extracts</p>Material &amp; methods</p>Four different extracts were prepared as described below from dried Capsicum leaves:</p>(1) Hexane extract: Lipids, sterols, mono and diterpenes, aliphatic hydro carbures, aliphatic alcools...</p>(2) Ethyl acetate extract after HC1 hydrolysis: Flavones, flavonols, quinones, organic acids, phenol acids, coumarines, lactones, low subsitued di-tri- and tetra-terpenes, sterols, pigments, alkaloids, lignans... \n\n (3) Methanol/H^O extract: heterosides from the aglycones present in the extract (2), polyphenols, carbohydrates, hydrosoluble alkaloids, small peptides, amino acids, anthocyanosides....</p>(4) as (3) but w/o polyphenols. PNPP columns</p>The \u03b23 adrenoreceptor activity was measured by incubating plant extracts for 1 hour with differentiated rodent preadipocytes previously loaded with [<sup>14</sup>C] Acetate. Isoproterenol, a non-specific \u03b2 adrenoreceptor agonist, was used at 1 \u03bcM as a positive control. The culture medium was collected at the end of the incubation and the released-labelled fatty acids were counted with a gamma counter. The cpm counted was normalised with the protein content per well. The values are expressed as percentage of the control value.</p>Results.</p>The results are given in figure 1, which shows that the extracts of Capsicum Sereno and Frutescens have a significant effect on \u03b2 3 -adrenoreceptor activity.</p>Example 2: Presence of \u03b23 adrenergic agonists in Cyperus Rotondus and Alfalfa</p>Methods</p>Binding assay was performed on membranes of rat adipose tissue. Membrane were incubated for 90 min at 37\u00b0C in the presence of [<sup>125</sup>I] cyanopindolol, a \u03b23 adrenergic agonist, and the plant extracts tested at 250 \u03bcg/ml. Following incubation, the membranes were rapidly filtered under vacuum though glass fibre filters. Filters were then washed several times with an ice-cold buffer and bound radioactivity was measured. Results are expressed as a percent inhibition of control values obtained in the presence of plant extracts.</p>Results \n\n The extracts of Cyperus Rotondus and Medicago Sativa were able to inhibit by and 66% and 44% the binding of [<sup>125</sup>I] cyanopindolol, respectively.</p>These results clearly show that these plant extracts contain compounds able to bind to the \u03b23 adrenergic receptors.</p>Example 3: \u03b23 adrenoreceptor activity of Cyperus Rotondus, Medicago Sativa and Iris Pallida extracts</p>Material &amp; methods</p>Four different extracts were prepared as described in example 1 from Cyperus leaves. The \u03b23 adrenoreceptor activity was measured by incubating plant extracts for 1 hour with differentiated rodent preadipocytes previously loaded with [<sup>14</sup>C] Acetate.</p>Isoproterenol, a non-specific \u03b2 adrenoreceptor, was used at 1 \u03bcM as a positive control.
