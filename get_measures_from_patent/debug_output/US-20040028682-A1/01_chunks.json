    "ts in tissues by determining the levels of TGF-\u03b2 in the tissues, a high level being indicative of such pathologies.</p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0007]FIG. 1 shows an analysis of dose response effects of TGF-\u03b2 on proteoglycan production by SDS-PAGE. Cultures of rat mesangial cells were treated with TGF-\u03b2 for 48 hours and metabolically labeled with <sup>35</sup>S sulfate. Equal volumes of conditioned media were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Beginning at 0.25 ng/ml (lane 2) there is an increase in PG I and PG II bands. At 2.5 ng/ml (lane 4) a shift in electrophoretic mobility is seen and at higher concentrations of 75 and 150 ng/ml (lanes 7 and 8) an inhibitory effect is present. Lane 1 is control and lanes 2-8 represent TGF-\u03b2 at 0.25, 0.75, 2.5, 25, 75 and 150 ng/ml. </p>[0008]FIG. 2 shows the effect of TGF-\u03b2 on synthesis of proteins secreted by mesangial cells. Cultures of rat mesangial cells were treated with TGF-\u03b2 for 48 hours and metabolically labeled with <sup>35</sup>S methionine. Equal volumes of conditioned media were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. TGF-\u03b2 did not affect the general pattern of secreted proteins. </p>[0009]FIG. 3 shows effects of growth of factors on proteoglycan production. Cultures of rat mesangial cells were treated with growth factors for 48 hours and metabolically labeled with <sup>35</sup>S sulfate. Equal volumes of conditioned media were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. TGF-\u03b2 increased two broad bands centered at 220 kD (biglycan) and 120 kD (decorin) and induced a structural change detected as a shift in electrophoretic mobility. PDGF, IL-1 and TNF had no significant effects. </p>[0010]FIG. 4 shows the effect of PDGF on the increased proteoglycan synthesis induced by TGF-\u03b2. Equal volumes of media from cultures labeled with <sup>35</sup>S sulfate and treated with various growth factor combinations were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. (Lane 1: control; Lane 2: TGF-\u03b2, 25 ng/ml; Lane 3: TGF-\u03b2 25 ng/ml+PDGF, 1 U/ml; Lane 4: TGF-\u03b2 25 ng/ml+PDGF, 0.5 U/ml). </p>[0011]FIG. 5 shows the immunological identification of proteoglycans affected by TGF-\u03b2. Equal volumes of control (lanes 1 and 3) or TGF-\u03b2 treated (lanes 2 and 4) conditioned media were immunoprecipitated with antiserum to synthetic peptides of the human core proteins of biglycan (lanes 1 and 2) and decorin (lanes 3 and 4). TGF-\u03b2 specifically increased the biglycan and decorin bands (lanes 2 and 4) compared to control. </p>[0012]FIG. 6 shows the characterization of the proteoglycans regulated by TGF-\u03b2. Metabolically labeled conditioned media were subjected to specific enzyme digestion. Lanes 1-4 are control and 5-8 are media from TGF-\u03b2 treated cultures (25 ng/ml). Lanes were treated with: saline (1 and 5), heparinase (2 and 6), chondroitinase ABC (3 and 7) and chondroitinase AC (4 and 8). The bands were digested in lanes 3 and 7 indicating the presence of a chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycan. Note the appearance of a core protein band (lane 7) wh",
    "re biosynthetically labeled and the conditioned media analyzed by SDS-PAGE with fluorography. The conditioned media from nephritic glomeruli stimulated the production of biglycan and decorin beginning on day 1, peaking on day 7 and then production decreased toward control levels by day 28. </p>[0017]FIG. 11 shows the effect of anti-TGF-\u03b2 synthetic peptide antibody on stimulation of proteoglycan production by conditioned media from nephritic glomeruli. Anti-TGF-\u03b2 antibody (Ab) or normal preimmune serum (NS) was mixed with the conditioned media from nephritic glomeruli isolated on day 4 (GN 4) and 7 (GN 7) following injection of anti-thymocyte serum. The antibody reduced proteoglycan production by 77 percent (GN 4) and 68 percent (GN 7). </p>[0018]FIG. 12 shows the specificity of the blocking effect of the anti-TGF-\u03b2 antibody. Conditioned media from nephritic glomeruli on day 7 following anti-thymocyte serum injection were mixed with normal preimmune serum (NS), anti-TGF-\u03b2 antibody (AB), or immunizing peptide (P) plus antibody. The peptide abolished the ability of the antibody to block the stimulation of proteoglycan production. </p>[0019]FIG. 13 shows enzymatic identification of the proteoglycans induced by conditioned media from nephritic glomeruli on day 7 following anti-thymocyte serum injection. Lane 1 is a control treated with saline. Lanes were treated with: heparinase II (lane 2), chondroitinase ABC (lane 3) and chondroitinase AC (lane 4). Complete digestion of the 220 kD and 120 kD bands is seen in lane 3 and partial digestion in lane 4, indicating the presence of chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycans. </p>[0020]FIG. 14 shows the immunological identification of the proteoglycans from the conditioned media shown in FIG. 13. Equal volumes of conditioned media from control or nephritic glomeruli were immunoprecipitated with antiserum to synthetic peptides of the human core protein of biglycan (lanes 1 and 2) and decorin (lanes 3 and 4). The biglycan (lane 2) and decorin (lane 4) bands were specifically increased in the conditioned media from the nephritic glomeruli (lanes 2 and 4) compared to control (lanes 1 and 3). </p>[0021]FIG. 15 shows the expression of TGF-\u03b2 in the kidney. Glomerular cells synthesizing TGF-\u03b2 after injection of anti-thymocyte serum were detected by immunofluorescence (n=30 glomeruli counted in each of 6 animals at each time point). *p&lt;0.001 nephritic animals compared to normal control. Values are mean\u00b1SD. </p>[0022]FIG. 16 shows immunofluorescence micrographs of glomeruli stained with anti-TGF-\u03b2 antibody. There is a striking increase in the number of glomerular cells staining for TGF-\u03b2 on day 7 (B) following induction of glomerulonephritis, compared to control (A) (\u00d7500). </p>[0023]FIG. 17 shows micrographs showing the enlargement of glomeruli in nephritic kidneys.

    "eoglycan Species [0039] 1. Immunoprecipitation </p>[0040] Immunoprecipitations were performed by adding b 100 \u03bcl of antiserum to 500 \u03bcl of conditioned medium or 300 \u03bcl of cell extract collected from duplicate wells in the presence or absence of added growth factors. In duplicate wells, cells were detached and counted to ensure uniformity of cell number. Preimmune serum was used in parallel control experiments. The samples were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0 C. with mixing in 4 ml conical tubes precoated with bovine serum albumin (BSA). Protein-A-Sepharose beads (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) were preincubated with fresh RPMI for 60 minutes at 22\u00b0 C. To precipitate the antigen-antibody complexes, 50 \u03bcl of suspended protein-A-Sepharose was added to the samples, and mixed at 4\u00b0 C. for 120 minutes. The samples were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 2000\u00d7G and the supernatant removed. The pellets were washed 10 times with 1 ml of ice cold PBS containing 0.5 M NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 pH 7.4. Finally, the pellets were washed with ice cold PBS, transferred to new tubes, recentrifuged, and washed 3 times with PBS. The pellets were dissolved in 40 \u03bcl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 3% SDS and 10% B mercaptoethanol (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) and boiled for 5 minutes. </p>[0041] The molecular size and type of the two proteoglycans produced by mesangial cells and regulated by TGF-\u03b2, corresponded to that of two proteoglycans, biglycan (PG I) and decorin (PG II). These proteoglycans are known to have 45 kD core proteins, the sequences of which have been deduced from cDNA (Krusius, T and Ruoslahti, E., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 83:7683-7687 (1986) and Fisher et al., J. Biol. Chem. 264:4571-4576 (1989) which are incorporated herein by reference). Polyclonal antibodies produced to synthetic peptides from the N-terminal sequences of these proteoglycans were used to identify the proteoglycans in the mesangial cell culture media. Immunoprecipitation of <sup>35</sup>S sulfate labeled conditioned media from control and TGF-\u03b2 treated cells followed by SDS-PAGE identified the 220 kD band as biglycan and the 120 kD band as decorin (FIG. 5). Immunoprecipitation of conditioned media from <sup>35</sup>S methionine-labeled cells with anti-fibronectin, laminin and type IV collagen antibodies and SDS-PAGE analysis of the immunoprecipitates showed no visible effect of TGF-\u03b2 on the levels of these proteins (data not shown). </p>[0042] 2. Enzyme Digestion </p>[0043] Digestion with glycosaminoglycan-degrading enzymes was used to determine the type of proteoglycans that were regulated by TGF-\u03b2. The digestion was performed on conditioned media after biosynthetic labeling. Aliquots of medium (25 \u03bcl) were mixed with 100 milliunits of chondroitinase ABC or chondroitinase AC both in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM calcium acetate, 2 mg/ml BSA or 100 milliunits of heparinase II in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM calcium chloride, 5 mM calcium acetate. All samples also received 1 mM PMSF, 5 mM benzamidine, 100 \u03bcg/ml soy bean trypsin inhibitor, 10 \u03bcg/ml leupeptin and 10 \u03bcg/ml antipain. All materials were obtained from Sigma. Chondroitinase-containing mixtures were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 1.5 hours. At termination samples were prepared for SDS-PAGE. </p>[0044] The small proteoglycans from control and TGF-\u03b2 treated cells were degraded by chondroitinase ABC but were insensitive to chondroitinase AC and heparinase (FIG. 6). The labeled material (large proteoglycan(s)) at the top of the gel appeared to be partially sensitive to digestion with both chondroitinase ABC and heparinase. These results indicate that the major proteoglycans produced by mesangial cells are chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycans. In addition to identifying the glycosaminoglycan type, incubation of TGF-\u03b2 conditioned medium with chondroitinase ABC resulted in the appearance of a new 45 kD band (FIG. 6). This band is likely to represent the proteoglycan core proteins after removal of portions of the chondroitin/dermatan sulfate chains. Enzyme treatment of conditioned medium from control cells did not yield a visible core protein. This indicates that part of the regulatory action of TGF-\u03b2 is to stimulate new synthesis of the proteoglycan core proteins. </p>EXAMPLE III Induction of Experimental Glomerulonephritis, Histologic Examination, Preparation of Glomerular Cultures, Culture media and Antibody Production [0045] a. Induction of Experimental Glomerulonephritis </p>[0046] To study the role of TGF-\u03b2 in the glomerular proteoglycan synthesis in vivo, a glomerulonephritis model in which the disease is induced with an anti-thymocyte serum (ATS) was produced by immunizing New Zealand white rabbits with 1\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>rat thymocytes in complete Freund's adjuvant, followed by boosting with 1\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>thymocytes given intravenously two and four weeks later. Preimmunization serum was collected from the same animal and used in control experiments as normal rabbit serum. Prior to use, ATS and normal serum were absorbed 3 times each with packed rat erythrocytes and rat liver power. The serum was then heat inactivated at 56\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes. Glomerulonephritis was induced in Sprague Dawley rats (4-6 weeks old) by intravenous administration of 1 ml ATS per 100 g body weight and 1 ml normal rabbit serum as a source of complement. Control animals received an equal",
    "his effect was reversed after addition of the immunizing peptide, which also had no effect on proteoglycan induction when added to the condition media. </p>EXAMPLE V Molecular Identification of Glomerular Proteoglycans [0059] The proteoglycans present in the glomerular cultures were identified with antibodies and an enzyme digestion. Labeled condition media from the day 7 glomerular cultures was digested with specific enzymes or conditioned media after biosynthetic labeling as described in Example II. Samples for SDS-PAGE were mixed with sample buffer containing 3% SDS, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10% B mercaptoethanol and heated for 5 minutes at 100\u00b0 C. as described above. Aliquots (20 \u03bcl) were equally applied to 4-12% gradient gels (Novex, Encinitas, Calif.). Molecular size markers were from Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden). Fluorography was performed by incubating gels in Enlightning (New England Nuclear). Typical exposure times for <sup>35</sup>S sulfate were 3 to 5 days. Fluorograms were scanned with an Ultrascan XL Enhanced Laser Densitometer (Pharmacia) to compare and quantitate the relative intensities and mobilities of the proteoglycan bands. The results showed that the induced small proteoglycans were fully sensitive to chondroitinase ABC and partially degraded by chondroitinase AC which indicates the presence of chondroitin/dermatan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains (FIG. 13). Immunoprecipitation of the same medium with specific antibodies, identified the 220 kD band as biglycan and the 120 kD band as decorin (FIG. 14). The immunoprecipitation was performed as described in Example II and the samples analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above. </p>[0060] The proteoglycans produced by the cultured mesangial cells in response to the conditioned media were identified as biglycan and decorin. These results are the same as observed following addition of exogenous TGF-\u03b2 to normal rat mesangial cells in culture as described in Example II. The slight cross-reactivity of the anti-biglycan and decorin peptide antibodies seen in FIG. 14 is likely to be due to the closely related sequences of the two core proteins Fisher et al., J. Biol. Chem. 264:4571-4576 (1989), which is incorporated herein by reference). </p>EXAMPLE VI Detection of Glomerular Cells Synthesizing TGF-\u03b2[0061] Anti-LC is an antibody made against a synthetic peptide from TGF-\u03b2 that reacts with cells thought to be synthesizing TGF-\u03b2 (Flanders et al. Biochemistry 27: 739 (1988). Anti-LC was used to detect TGF-\u03b2 production by glomerular cells throughout the 28 day course of glomerulonephritis induced by ATS. Staining of glomeruli from normal control rats with this antibody showed an average of about 20 cells per glomerulus that were positive. In glomeruli from nephritic animals, the number of glomerular cells stained by anti-LC was unchanged on day 4 but doubled on day 7, the peak of glomerular proteoglycan production. The temporal pattern of the increase in the number of cells positive for TGF-\u03b2 roughly parallels "
