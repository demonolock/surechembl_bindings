{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n* The compounds tested above exhibit IC50 values significantly less than 10 \u03bc\u039c, with the most potent compounds showing antagonist activity at the prokineticin receptor with IC50 values &lt; 1 \u03bc\u039c.\n* To test for antagonist activity, test compounds at a final concentration range between 0.32nM - 10\u03bc\u039c (diluted in assay buffer) are added to the assay wells and allowed to incubate for 10 minutes prior to stimulation with PK1.\n* Readings from wells that do not contain antagonist enable percentage inhibition curves to be plotted using 4- parameter fit algorithm and IC50 values are calculated for each test compound."}
