    "d OD was measured at 450 nM.</p>Antibody purification and characterization. The culture supernatant was applied to protein A Sepharose columns (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with PBS, and protein was then eluted with eluting buffer (0.1 M sodium citrate buffer, pH 3.0). Collected fractions were neutralized with 1 M Tris pH 9.0. Finally, purified samples were dialyzed against PBS. Purity of the eluted antibody fraction was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) on 10% gels under reducing or non-reducing conditions. Bands were visualized by Coomassie brilliant blue staining.</p>Antibody affinity measurement. Human SIRPa-His fusion protein was made by fusing the extracellular domain of human SIRPa to His-tag and used for measuring monomeric binding affinity to 1H9 and 3C2. Binding experiments were performed on Biacore 3000 at 25\u00b0 C. Goat anti-human capture antibody was immobilized (as indicated in the table) on the surface of the chip by direct immobilization using EDC/NHS coupling chemistry on flow cell 2, 3 and 4 of the CM5 chip. The unoccupied sites were blocked with 1M ethanol amine. Flow cell was untreated and used as reference for subtraction of any non-specific binding of the Ag to the chip surface. The test Abs were captured on flow cell 2, 3 and 4 at an RU as indicated. Antigen was flowed over the chip at single analyte concentration. Binding of antigen to the ligand was monitored in real time to obtain on (ka) and off (kd) rates. The equilibrium constant (K<sub>D</sub>) was calculated from the observed ka and kd. For the fast off rate interactions, KD was determined by steady state kinetic analysis.</p>In vitro phagocytosis assay. Raji and HT29 cancer cells were washed and counted, then 25 \u03bcL containing 1\u00d710<sup>5 </sup>cells in serum-free IMDM were added to each well. Antibody treatment (in 25 \u03bcL) with a final concentration of 10 \u03bcg/mL of 1H9, 3C2 (otherwise indicated in the figures), rituximab or 0.1 \u03bcg/mL of cetuximab was added to the wells and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes. At 30 minutes, Macrophages that had previously been harvested with TrypLE were counted and plated with 5\u00d710<sup>4 </sup>cells in 50 \u03bcL of serum-free IMDM. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 2 hours (Effector:Target=1:2). Phagocytosis percentage was calculated by Flow Cytometry analysis looking for GFP+ Macrophages.</p>Genotyping SIRPa variants. Genomic DNA was isolated from human donor blood samples using QIAamp DNA isolation kit (Qiagen). PCR was performed by using the isolated genomic DNA and primers of TAG AAT AC A GGC TCA TGT TGC AGG T and GCC TTC AGC AAA TAG CAT GAC GT. PCR fragments were purified and sequenced. Different SIRPa variants were analyzed and identified according to SIRPa reference sequences (Polymorphism in Sirpa modulates engraftment of human hematopoietic stem cells. Nature Immunology, 8; 1313, 2007).</p>Blocking human CD47 binding on monocytes isolated from human donors. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from human blood using Ficoll. 5\u00d710<sup>5 </sup>cells were incubated with 1 ug/ml of AF4"
