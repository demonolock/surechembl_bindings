Reaction not complete and no progress was observed after several hours. Hunig's Base (5.34 \u03bcl, 0.031 mmol) was added and the reaction advanced. The reaction was loaded directly onto column (6 g C-18 0-75% MeCN/Water) for purification.

The reaction stirred at RT for 30 minutes before adding the reaction mixture to MMAF (50 mg, 0.067 mmol). The reaction then stirred at RT for 4 hours. The reaction mixture was loaded directly onto 35 g C-18 column for purification by column chromatography (5-75% MeCN/Water 0.1% formic acid). The solvent was removed on rotovap and placed on high vac overnight.</p>The resulting product was treated with TFA (2 mL) at 0\u00b0 C. and brought to room temp to stir for 5 min. The reaction was loaded directly onto a 35 g C-18 column for column purification. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure to yield 30 mg (52% yield).</p>The deprotected amine (20 mg, 0.023 mmol) was dissolved in THF then LiOH (1 mL, 4.00 mmol) was added. The reaction stirred at RT for 30 minutes was then loaded directly onto column (35 g C-18 column) for purification (0% MeCN followed by 20-40% MeCN/Water). Product eluted with THF and column rerun under above conditions to yield 10"
