In particular instances, the chelators can bind to siderocalin. In some instances, the chelators can bind to a dye. For example, the chelators can bind to a fluorophore. Additionally, the chelators can bind to both a protein and a dye. In various instances, the chelators can bind to a metal to form a chelator-metal complex that can also bind to siderocalin. The metal can include a radionuclide.</p>The chelators and/or the chelator-metal complex can have an equilibrium dissociation constant with siderocalin of no greater than 100 nanomolar (nM), no greater than 90 nM, no greater than 80 nM, no greater than 70 nM, no greater than 60 nM, no greater than 50 nM, no greater than 45 nM, no greater than 40 nM, no greater than 35 nM, no greater than 30 nM, no greater than 25 nM, no greater than 20 nM, or no greater than 15 nM.

    "/p>In particular embodiments, targeting domains can also include a natural receptor or ligand for an epitope. For example, if a target for binding includes PD-L1, the binding domain can include PD-1 (including, e.g., a PD-1/antiCD3 fusion). One example of a receptor fusion for binding is Enbrel<sup>\u00ae</sup> (Immunex). Natural receptors or ligands can also be modified to enhance binding. For example, betalacept is a modified version of abatacept.</p>Binding can also be enhanced through increasing avidity. Any screening method known in the art can be used to identify increased avidity to an antigen epitope.</p>As used herein, an epitope denotes the binding site on a protein target bound by a corresponding targeting domain. The targeting domain either binds to a linear epitope, (e.g., an epitope including a stretch of 5 to 12 consecutive amino acids), or the targeting domains binds to a three-dimensional structure formed by the spatial arrangement of several short stretches of the protein target. Three-dimensional epitopes recognized by a targeting domain, e.g. by the epitope recognition site or paratope of an antibody or antibody fragment, can be thought of as three-dimensional surface features of an epitope molecule. These features fit precisely (in)to the corresponding binding site of the targeting domains and thereby binding between the targeting domains and its target protein is facilitated.</p>\"Bind\" means that the targeting domain associates with its target epitope with a dissociation constant (1(D) of 10<sup>-8</sup> M or less, in one embodiment of from 10<sup>-5</sup> M to 10<sup>-13</sup> M, in one embodiment of from 10<sup>-5</sup> M to 10<sup>-10</sup> M, in one embodiment of from 10<sup>-5</sup> M to 10<sup>-7</sup> M, in one embodiment of from 10<sup>-8</sup> M to 10<sup>-13</sup> M, or in one embodiment of from 10<sup>-9</sup> M to 10<sup>-13</sup> M. The term can be further used to indicate that the targeting domains does not bind to other biomolecules present, (e.g., it binds to other biomolecules with a dissociation constant (KD) of 10<sup>-4</sup> M or more, in one embodiment of from 10<sup>-4</sup> M to 1 M.</p>In particular embodiments, targeting domains of SCCs can be designed to target cancer cell antigens. Cancer cell antigens are preferentially expressed by cancer cells. \"Preferentially expressed\" means that a cancer cell antigen is found at higher levels on cancer cells as compared to other cell types. The difference in expression level is significant enough that, within sound medical judgment, administration of therapeutics selectively targeting the cancer cells based on the presence of the cancer antigen outweighs the risk of collateral killing of other non-cancer cells that may also express the marker to a lesser degree. In some instances, a cancer antigen is only expressed by the targeted cancer cell type. In other instances, the cancer antigen is expressed on the targeted cancer cell type at least 25%, 35%, 45%, 55%, 65%, 75%, 85%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% more than on non-targeted cells.</p>The following table provides examples of particular cancer antigens that can be targeted by SCCs.\nTargeted CancerCancer AntigensLeukemia/LymphomaCD19, CD20, CD22, ROR1, CD33, WT-1Multiple MyelomaB-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)Prostate CancerPSMA, WT1, Prostate Stem Cell antigen (PSCA), SV40 TBreast CancerHER2, ERBB2, ROR1Stem Cell CancerCD133Ovarian CancerL1-CAM, extracellular domain of MUC16 (MUC-CD), folate binding protein (folate receptor), Lewis Y, ROR1, mesothelin, WT-1Mesotheliomame",
    "ccording to Equation (1), where the metal and chelator are designated as M and L, respectively. All metal and chelator concentrations were held at estimated values determined from the volume of standardized stock solutions. All species formed with 3,4,3-LI(CAM) were considered to have significant absorbance to be observed in the UV-vis spectra and were therefore included in the refinement process. The refinements of the overall formation constants \u03b2 included in each case with previously determined chelator protonation constants and the metal hydrolysis products, whose equilibrium constants were fixed to the literature values (Smith, et al., NIST standard reference database 46.

Equimolar amounts of metal and chelator were used to constitute metal-chelator solutions (2 \u00b5M, pH 7.4, 5% DMSO) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS). Then, a solution of recombinant wild-type Scn (50 nM, 3 mL, 10 \u00b5g/mL ubiquitin, TBS pH 7.4, 5% DMSO) was titrated with the metal-chelator solution. Fluorescence quenching of Scn was measured after each titrant addition on a HORIBA Jobin Yvon IBH FluoroLog-3 spectrofluorimeter, with 3 nm slit band-pass, using the characteristic excitation and emission wavelengths \u03bb<sub>exc</sub> = 280 and \u03bb<sub>em</sub> = 320-360 nm. The intrinsic fluorescence in proteins is generally attributed to tryptophan residues; two residues W31 and W79 are found in the proximity of the Scn binding site. Fluorescence values were corrected for dilution upon addition of titrant. Fluorescence data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis of fluorescence response versus chelator concentration using a one-site binding model as described elsewhere. Allred, et al., PNAS, 2015, 112 (33): 10342-10347) The K<sub>d</sub> values are the results of at least three independent titrations were determined according to Equation (2). Control experiments were performed with [Fe<sup>III</sup>(Ent)]<sup>3-</sup> to ensure the stability of the protein under experimental conditions.</p>Crystallography.

    "ic chemistry, 2015, 54 (7): 3462-3468). For Eu(III), complexation by 3,4,3-LI(CAM) starts at pH 5 and the mono-protonated complex, [Eu<sup>III</sup>LH]<sup>4-</sup>, is the only species present at pH 7.4. Similar to what is observed with 4+ metals, the pH at which Eu(III)<sup>-3</sup>,4,3-LI(CAM) complexes start forming is higher than in the case of Eu(III)<sup>-3</sup>,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) species that already appear at pH 1 under those same conditions (Abergel, et al., Inorganic chemistry, 2009, 48 (23): 10868-10870). However, it is important to note the multiple negative charges of the 3,4,3-LI(CAM) complexes with 3+ and 4+ metals complexes under physiologically relevant conditions ([M<sup>III</sup>LH]<sup>4-</sup>, [M<sup>IV</sup>LH]<sup>3-</sup> and [M<sup>IV</sup>L]<sup>4-</sup>), which are now capable of forming electrostatic interactions with the Scn protein. This represents a large advantage over 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO), for which the complexes with M<sup>III</sup> at pH 7.4 have only one negative charge and are neutral in the case of M<sup>IV</sup> ions.</p>Scn Recognition of 3,4,3-LI(CAM)-Metal Complexes. As described in several previous reports (Allred, et al., PNAS, 2015, 112 (33): 10342-10347; Abergel, et al., J Am Chem Soc, 2006, 128 (34): 10998-10999; Abergel, et al., PNAS 2006, 103 (49): 18499-18503), the affinity of Scn for chelators or metal-chelator complexes is quantified by monitoring protein fluorescence quenching upon ligand or complex binding. The equilibrium dissociation constant of Scn for the apo form of the chelator 3,4,3-LI(CAM), K<sub>d</sub> = 1.2 \u00b1 0.4 nM, is nearly identical to that determined for the native siderophore apo-Ent,11a indicating that the addition of a fourth CAM unit does not affect chelator recognition by the protein. Subsequent determination of K<sub>d</sub> values for various metal complexes of 3,4,3-LI(CAM) (M<sup>III</sup> = Sm, Eu, Gd, <sup>243</sup>Am, or <sup>248</sup>Cm, and M<sup>IV</sup> = Zr, <sup>232</sup>Th, or <sup>242</sup>Pu) confirm tight binding to the protein, independent of the metal valence, with values well below 40 nM (FIG. 12). As hypothesized, these data demonstrate a large difference in protein recognition between the 3,4,3-LI(CAM) and 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) complexes of tetravalent metals. Use of the biprotic CAM units in lieu of the monoprotic 1,2-HOPO moieties led to the formation of negatively charged complexes, enabling electrostatic interactions with the protein trilobal calyx. In addition, while the addition of a fourth CAM metal-binding group in the octadentate 3,4,3-LI(CAM) was important for increased stability of the metal-ligand complexes at pH 7.4, it did not prevent the high Scn affinities initially observed with hexa-coordinated Ent complexes. Interestingly, some subtle differences were observed with the recognition patterns: for similarly charged complexes, weaker binding was observed with actinide complexes (Amlll, Cm<sup>III</sup>, Th<sup>IV</sup>, and Pu<sup>IV</sup>)"
