    "n the sequence corresponding to the El A and/or E2B regions of these loops that are depicted in SEQ ID NOS: 9 and 10. These point mutations can e.g. reflect the differences between CLDN6 and its closely related paralogue CLDN4. </p>[133] A further method to determine the contribution of a specific residue of a target antigen to the recognition by a construct or binding domain is alanine scanning (see e.g. Morrison KL &amp; Weiss GA. Curr Opin Chem Biol. 2001 Jun;5(3):302-7), where each residue to be analyzed is replaced by alanine, e.g. via site-directed mutagenesis. Alanine is used because of its non-bulky, chemically inert, methyl functional group that nevertheless mimics the secondary structure references that many of the other amino acids possess. Sometimes bulky amino acids such as valine or leucine can be used in cases where conservation of the size of mutated residues is desired. </p>[134] The interaction between the binding domain and the epitope of the target antigen implies that a binding domain exhibits appreciable or significant affinity for the epitope / the target antigen (here: CLDN6 and CD3, respectively) and, generally, does not exhibit significant affinity for proteins or antigens other than the target antigen (here: CLDN6 / CD3) - notwithstanding the above discussed crossreactivity with homologous targets e.g. from other species, or with CLDN9 of the same species, particularly human CLDN6 and CLDN9. \u201cSignificant affinity\u201d includes binding with an affinity (dissociation constant, KD) of &lt;10-6 M. Preferably, binding is considered specific when the binding affinity is &lt;10-7 M, &lt;10-8 M, &lt;10-9 M, &lt;10-10 M, or even &lt;10-11 M, or &lt;10-12 M. Whether a binding domain (immuno-)specifically reacts with or binds to a target can be tested readily e.g. by comparing the affinity of said binding domain to its desired target protein or antigen with the affinity of said binding domain to non-target proteins or antigens (here: proteins other than CLDN6 or CD3, respectively). \n\nPreferably, a construct of the invention does not significantly bind to proteins or antigens other than CLDN6 or CD3, respectively (i.e., the first domain does not bind to proteins other than CLDN6 and the second domain does not bind to proteins other than CD3) - unless any further binding domain(s) directed against a further target is/are deliberately introduced into the construct of the invention, in which case the binding of that binding domain to its specific target is also provided by the present invention. </p>[135] It is envisaged that the affinity of the first domain for CLDN6 (e.g. human CLDN6) is &lt;100 nM, &lt;90 nM, &lt;80 nM, &lt;70 nM, &lt;60 nM, &lt;50 nM, &lt;40 nM, &lt;30 nM, or &lt;20 nM. These values are preferably measured in a cell-based assay, such as a Scatchard assay. Other methods of determining the affinity are also well-known. It is furthermore envisaged that the affinity of the second domain for CD3 (e.g. human CD3) is &lt;100 nM, &lt;90 nM, &lt;80 ",
    "the first antigen-binding domain of the construct selectively and, preferably, specifically binds to an epitope comprised within the first CLDN6 extracellular loop (CLDN6 ECL1), within the second CLDN6 extracellular loop (CLDN6 ECL2), particularly it binds to an epitope that is formed by a combination of both loops. It is hence envisaged that the domain comprising a paratope (antigen-binding (epitope-binding) structure) of the construct of the invention binds to an epitope formed by one or both extracellular loops of CLDN6, preferably of human CLDN6. The extracellular loop can be the first loop and/or the second loop. It is also particularly envisaged that both loops contribute to the binding. In this case, it is possible that one loop (such as the first loop) represents the main binding partner for the construct, and the other loop (such as the second loop) contributes to the binding, e.g. as a stabilizing partner, but is not essential for the binding. The domain comprising a paratope (antigen-binding (epitope-binding) structure) according to the invention may hence bind to CLDN6 when it is expressed by naturally expressing cells or cell lines (such as human cancer lines OVCAR-3, OAW28, LCLC97TM1, and NCI-H1435), and/or by cells or cell lines transformed or (stably / transiently) transfected with CLDN6. In one embodiment, the domain comprising a paratope (antigen-binding (epitope-binding) structure) that binds to CLDN6 when CLDN6 is used as a target molecule in a cell-based binding assay such as Scatchard. It is furthermore envisaged that the construct / its first domain binds to human CLDN6 on the surface of a target cell. A preferred amino acid sequence for human CLDN6 is depicted in SEQ ID NO: 1. </p>[139] It is envisaged that the polypeptide construct according to the invention (and, more specifically, the domain comprising a paratope (antigen-binding (epitope-binding) structure) binding CLDN6 of said construct) binds to the first extracellular loop (ECL1, loop 1) of CLDN6. This does not necessarily exclude that the second extracellular loop also contributes, albeit to a different, e.g. a lesser, extent, to the paratope-eptiope interaction site. The term \u201cCLDN6 ECL\u201d (ECL = extracellular loop) refers to those parts of of CLDN6 which are essentially free of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of CLDN6. It is understood that the transmembrane domains identified for the CLDN6-binding polypeptide of the present invention are identified pursuant to criteria routinely employed in the art for identifying that type of hydrophobic domain. The exact boundaries of a transmembrane domain may vary but most likely by no more than about 5 amino acids at either end of the domain explicitly mentioned herein. A preferred human CLDN6 ECL1 is shown in SEQ ID NO: 9, and a preferred human CLDN6 ECL2 is shown in SEQ ID NO: 10. In one very specific embodiment the construct according to the invention (and, more specifically, the first domain of said construct) "
