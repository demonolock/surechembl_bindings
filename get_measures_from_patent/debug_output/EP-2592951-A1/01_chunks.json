    "ed. However, phytoalexins are only recently being explored as nutritional components and a source for development of health promoting food products. The gly- ceollins (I, II, and III) are the predominant soybean phytoalexins studied. They belong to the sub-subclass of pterocarpans, and show antimicrobial activity against nu- merous soybean pathogens. Recent research has shown that the glyceollins have anti-estrogenic and anticancer activities (Burow et al. 2001; Salvo et al. 2006; Wood et al. 2006). Further work has shown that extracts from elicitor-treated soybeans have higher antioxidant activi- ties when compared to untreated controls (Feng et al.</p>2007). Glyceollin I, glyceollin II and glyceollin III are usually present in elicitated soybean seedlings in the ratio of 1 to 2 to 6 (Keen et al. 1986) . Depending on the plant part other ratios may be found. Soy phytoalexins from the sub-subclass of pterocarpans, long known only as plant defensive antimicrobials, are now being viewed as beneficial plant compounds that can be considered along- \n\n side other soy isoflavonoids when health promoting properties are evaluated. Some of these phytoalexin compounds as well as isoflavonoid derivatives have been tested for their ability to bind to the estrogen receptors alpha and beta. In general such binding tests are done with HPLC purified components that are tested for relative binding to estrogen receptor alpha and beta using a variety of standard assays. Such assays result in an IC50, presenting the concentration at which 50% of the receptors are bound by the test compound. IC50 values have been published for the compounds indicated in the Table 2 below. For some compounds more than one IC50 have been reported. The exact values of the IC50s seem to depend on the details of the estrogen binding assay used (see Table 2). </p>Table 2: </p>\n It has further been described that prenylated genistein (Kretzschmar et al. 2010) and prenylated OH- genistein (Okamoto et al. 2006) act similarly towards estrogen receptor alpha as genistein. A study by Ahn et al. (2004) suggested that prenylated derivatives of genistein may act as antagonists. </p> The capability to bind to the estrogen receptors is interpreted as indicative for in vivo estrogenic or anti-estrogenic effects. This mechanism is associated with some of the health promoting effects of legumes. </p> The inventors are not aware of any commercial soy product on the global market, enriched in glyceol- lins. Phytoalexin-enriched foods could be defined as any food prepared from plant material that contains higher concentrations or de novo synthesized levels of phy- toalexins resulting from elicitor treatment. Elicitor treatments range from biotic elicitors such as microorganisms {Aspergillus sojae, Aspergillus oryzae, and </p>Rhizopus oligosporus) , microorganism cell wall extracts, and carbohydrates to abiotic elicitors including UV induction, wounding (e.g. cutting) heavy metal salts (e.g. CuCl2) and other chemicals such as iodoacetate. As a proof of concept, it has recently been shown on lab scale, that black soybeans germinated under fungal stress with food grade R. oligosporus could technically be utilized for the production of soy milk and soy yogurt containing glyceollins and oxylipins (Feng et al . 2008). <"
