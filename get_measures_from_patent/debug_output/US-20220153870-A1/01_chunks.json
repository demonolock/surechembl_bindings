As used herein, \u201cspecific binding\u201d refers to binding which is selective for the antigen, and which can be discriminated from non-specific binding to non-target antigen. An antigen-binding molecule that specifically binds to a target molecule preferably binds the target with greater affinity, and/or with greater duration than it binds to other, non-target molecules.</p>The ability of a given polypeptide to bind specifically to a given molecule can be determined by analysis according to methods known in the art, such as by ELISA, Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR; see e.g. Hearty et al., Methods Mol Biol (2012) 907:411-442), Bio-Layer Interferometry (see e.g. Lad et al., (2015) J Biomol Screen 20(4): 498-507), flow cytometry, or by a radiolabeled antigen-binding assay (RIA) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Through such analysis binding to a given molecule can be measured and quantified. In some embodiments, the binding may be the response detected in a given assay.</p>In some embodiments, the extent of binding of the antigen-binding molecule to an non-target molecule is less than about 10% of the binding of the antibody to the target molecule as measured, e.g. by ELISA, SPR, Bio-Layer Interferometry or by RIA. Alternatively, binding specificity may be reflected in terms of binding affinity where the antigen-binding molecule binds with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) that is at least 0.1 order of magnitude (i.e. 0.1\u00d710<sup>n</sup>, where n is an integer representing the order of magnitude) greater than the K<sub>D </sub>of the antigen-binding molecule towards a non-target molecule. This may optionally be one of at least 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0.</p>In some embodiments, the antigen-binding molecule displays binding to human HER3, mouse HER3, rat HER3 and/or cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis) HER3. That is, in some embodiments the antigen-binding molecule is cross-reactive for human HER3, mouse HER3, rat HER3 and/or cynomolgus macaque HER3. In some embodiments the antigen-binding molecule of the present invention displays cross-reactivity with HER3 of a non-human primate. Cross-reactivity to HER3 in model species allows in vivo exploration of efficacy in syngeneic models without relying on surrogate molecules.</p>In some embodiments the antigen-binding molecule binds to human HER3, mouse HER3, rat HER3 and/or cynomolgus macaque HER3; and does not bind to HER2 and/or EGFR (e.g. human HER2 and/or human EGFR).</p>In some embodiments, the antigen-binding molecule does not display specific binding to EGFR (e.g. human EGFR). In some embodiments, the antigen-binding molecule does not display specific binding to HER2 (e.g. human HER2).
