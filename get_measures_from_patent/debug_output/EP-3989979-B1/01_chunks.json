The compounds of formula (I), more particularly the compounds P9 and P11, are therefore particularly useful for inhibiting Orai1-SOCE. The subject of the invention is therefore a compound of formula (I), for its use in the inhibition of Orail-SOCE. The invention therefore also relates to a compound of formula (I) for its use in the modulation of calcium channels in an immune cell.</p>More generally, the subject of the invention is a compound of formula (I), for its use as a medicine, in particular as an immunosuppressant. Under these conditions, the compounds of formula (I) can thus be used in particular to prevent graft rejection. </p>The invention also relates to a compound of formula (I) for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.</p>The invention relates more particularly to a compound of formula (I) for its use as an inhibitor of immune cells, in particular leukocytes such as T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes, as well as monocytes.</p>The invention also relates to a compound of formula (I) for its use in inhibiting the functions of immune cells. By way of illustration, we can cite their use to inhibit the production of cytokines, in particular cytokines which regulate the activation of immune cells, more particularly to inhibit the production of IL-2 by T lymphocytes. We can also cite their use to inhibit the production of free oxyg",
    "shows that the 2-APB thus synthesized has its classic properties: significant potentiation of calcium entry at 5 \u00b5M and almost total inhibition at 50 \u00b5M.</p>The dose-response curves were established after addition of 2-APB or one of its analogues 30 seconds before the reintroduction of calcium. The results show that 2-APB analogues do not have the property of increasing the cytosolic calcium concentration. The increase in the size of the molecules at the level of the phenyl groups therefore has a negative effect on the potentiation activity. The analogues tested are therefore SOCE inhibitors without the potentiating effect of the increase in cytosolic calcium normally observed at low doses with 2-APB (see Table 1). &lt;b&gt;Table 1&lt;/b&gt; CompoundKi (nM) P11 75 \u00b1 21 P6 275 \u00b1 17 P15 294 \u00b1 74 P8 350 \u00b1 40  P12 374 \u00b1 96 Dibenzothienyl-APB (Djillani 2014) 405 \u00b1 23 P10 484 \u00b1 116 P9 641 \u00b1 103 P7 751 \u00b1 97 CompoundKi (\u00b5M) P13 1.84 \u00b1 0.1 P5 2.1 \u00b1 0.6 P16 3.1 \u00b1 0.6 P3 3.5 \u00b1 0.6 P2 3.5 \u00b1 0.65 P14 5.4 \u00b1 0.3 P4 75 \u00b1 21 P17 &gt;&gt; 1 \u00b5M</p>Compounds P3 and P5 include a methyl group on each of the phenyl groups of the molecule (para and meta, respectively). P7 and P10 correspond to compounds P3 and P5 to which a second methyl group has been added to each of the phenyl groups (a meta group and a para group of each of the phenyls). These modifications result in a significant increase in the inhibition efficiency of the molecules. Compound P10 is, however, the more active of the two with a Ki of approximately 500 nM and total inhibition obtained at 3 \u00b5M.</p>Other analogs were generated with a methoxy group on each of the phenyl groups of 2-APB (compounds P2 and P4). It is observed that the placement of the methoxy group in the para position makes it possible to obtain a compound (compound P2) having an activity equivalent to that of the compound comprising a methyl group at this position (compound P3). On the other hand, the placement of this methoxy group in meta (compound P4) has a drastic negative impact on the inhibition constant, which rises to 75 \u00b1 21 \u00b5M, with a maximum inhibition of only 80%. Compound P16 combines a para methyl group on one of the phenyls, and a methoxy group on the other phenyl. This compound has an inhibitory activity similar to compounds P2 and P3 (3.1 \u00b1 0.6 \u00b5M).</p>Halogenated analogues have also been prepared. These are compounds P13, P14 and P15. Compounds P13 and P14, in which a chlorine and a fluorine are located para to each of the phenyl groups, respectively, have an activity equivalent to compound P3. Of  Surprisingly, compound P15, which is similar to compound P7 for which a chlorine atom would have been substituted for the meta methyl groups of each of the phenyl groups, exhibits improved inhibitory activity with a Ki of approximately 300 nM.</p>Compounds P8 and P9 are analogues comprising, in para phenyl groups, substituents larger than the methyl group of compounds P3, with a tert-butyl and n-butyl group respectively. This modification results in a significant increase in the inhibitory activity of the analogs, with a Ki of 350 \u00b1 40 nM and 641 \u00b1 103 nM respectively. It is therefore demonstrated that the addition of larger groups leads to an increase in the inhibitory activity of the compounds.</p>Furthermore, analogues comprising a naphthyl group (compound P6), or benzothienyl (compound P12) in place of each phenyl group of 2-APB have been synthesized. Compounds P6 and P12 exhibit significant inhibitory activity, with a Ki of 275 \u00b1 17 nM and 374 \u00b1 96 nM, respectively.</p>However, the best inhibitor identified is the compound P11, which includes a phenyl group para-linked to each of the phenyl groups of 2-APB, and has a Ki of 75 \u00b1 21 nM on Jurkat cells. Quite surprisingly, the imposition of a constraint between the two phenyl groups via the introduction of a gem-dimethyl (compound P17) results in a total absence of activity of the compound resulting in a Ki greater than 3 \u00b5M. The free rotation of the two phenyl groups of compound P11 therefore seems to be an important parameter for maintaining the very high effectiveness of said compound.</p>2.2. Specific inhibition of SOCE without impact on calcium efflux mechanismsTo determine if the compound P11 has an action on SOCE and not on the calcium efflux mechanisms, a quenching experiment with Mn <sup>2+</sup> was carried out using the indo-1 molecule. Mn <sup>2+</sup> ions enter cells via SOCCs, but cannot be pumped into the extracellular medium by plasma membrane calcium-dependent ATPases (plasma membrane Ca <sup>2+</sup> ATPases, or PMCA), the sodium exchanger/ calcium (Na <sup>+</sup> /Ca <sup>2+</sup> exchanger, or NCX) or returned to the lumen of the ER by sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum Ca <sup>2+</sup> ATPases, or SERCA). Once in the cell, Mn <sup>2+</sup> binds to indo-1 and quenches its fluorescence measured at 430 nm. An augmentation of  the amplitude of the Mn <sup>2+</sup> influx is therefore associated with an increase in the quenching speed of indo-1, and vice versa.</p>After 10 minutes of treatment with TG to open SOCCs, 100 \u00b5M MnCl <sub>2</sub> was added. A quenching rate of -0.89 \u00b1 0.05% Fo/s was observed ( Figure 3A ). In the presence of increasing concentrations of P11 added 30 seconds before the addition of Mn <sup>2+</sup> ions, the quenching rate decreased to approximately 90% blocking at 1 \u00b5M (-0.09 \u00b1 0.01, Figure 3A ).</p>Compound P11 therefore targets SOCE.</p>Furthermore, the Figure 3B shows that P11 is also capable of blocking SOCE in other cell types, with an efficiency significantly higher than that observed in Jurkat cells. Thus, Ki of 32 \u00b1 2 nM, 40 \u00b1 5 nM and 50 \u00b1 5 nM were calculated in DG75 (B lymphocytes), U937 (monocytes) and MDA-MB231 (hormone-independent breast cancer) cells respectively, against 75 \u00b1 21 nM for Jurkat cells ( Figure 3B ). There Figure 3B also shows that complete inhibition is achieved at 100 nM.</p>2.3. Selectivity of the compounds of the inventionThe selectivity of compound P11 and the close compound P9 was evaluated.</p>Measurements of <sup>45</sup> Ca <sup>2+</sup> loading and IP3-dependent release were performed on permeabilized cells under unidirectional conditions.</p>There Figure 4 presents the results obtained with P9 and P11.</p>P9 did not significantly inhibit IP3R activity and was only a partial inhibitor of SERCA activity, with an inhibition of -52 \u00b1 3% at 100 \u00b5M and a Ki of 6 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5M. Below 3 \u00b5M, compound P9 only inhibits SOCE.</p>P11 only very slightly inhibits IP3R, with a value of 29 \u00b1 9% at 100 \u00b5M, the calculation of Ki in relation to this receptor having also proven impossible due to the very high concentrations which would have been necessary for get this value. SERCA is inhibited by 89%  by P11, at a concentration greater than 30 \u00b5M. However, this activity is incommensurable with that observed on SOCE, since the Ki for SERCA is 7.4 \u00b5M while that for SOCE is 75 nM, i.e. 100 times less for the latter. This results in P11 being a more selective inhibitor of SOCE at concentrations below 1 \u00b5M, with no effect on SERCA and IP3R.</p>2.4. Compounds of the invention prevent activation of Jurkat cellsActivation of T lymphocytes requires an increase in cytosolic calcium concentration for several minutes to allow the synthesis of interleukin 2 (IL-2), and the activation of immune functions. Accordingly, inhibition of the increase in cytosolic calcium concentration due to SOCE prevents T cell activation and proliferation.</p>The concentration of newly synthesized IL-2 was measured in the culture medium of Jurkat cells stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) after 24 h, in the presence of increasing concentrations of compound P11. In the absence of stimulation by PHA, Jurkat cells do not produce IL-2. Conversely, stimulation with PHA allows the detection of approximately 100 pg/ml of IL-2 (103 \u00b1 4 pg/ml, figure 5A ). Addition of increasing concentrations of P11 concurrent with PHA stimulation results in a progressive decrease in IL-2 synthesis to 26 \u00b1 6 pg/ml per 1 \u00b5M P11 (- 74%, Figure 5B ).</p>PHA alone or P11 alone did not exhibit toxic effects on cells. However, the combination of treatment of cells with PHA and increasing concentrations of P11 significantly increases the percentage of dead cells (from approximately 5% without treatment, to 33.2 \u00b1 1.3% at 1 \u00b5M P11, Figure 5B ).
