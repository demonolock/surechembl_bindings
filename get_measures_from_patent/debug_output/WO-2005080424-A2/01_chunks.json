    "ive substitutions \"allowed\" according to the PAM (\"Point</p>Accepted Mutations\") or Blosum matrices (\"BLOCKS Substitution Matrix, Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992; PNAS 89:10915-10919) are also regarded as functionality-conserving substitutions within the meaning of the present invention.</p>A \"rigid bend\" in a peptide is in the present context a conformational constraint in the amino acid chain. In nature, it is known that proline residues introduce a fixed angle in an amino acid chain, because the amino group that is part of the peptide bond also is parts of a ring structure, meaning that there is no free rotation. Similarly, amino acids having \"bulky\" or charged side groups may be sterically hindered from attaining all conformations if neighbouring amino acid residues are somehow capable of interacting with these residues.</p>A \"multimer\" denotes a molecule that includes at least two identical peptides of the present invention, either as a linear repeat of the same peptide sequence where the peptides are joined end-to-end, or in the form of covalently or non-covalently linked copies of peptides of the invention that are not joined end-to-end. This may include aggregation via non-covalent \"weak bonds\" or interpeptide disulphide or amide bonds. According to the invention, dimers are especially attractive multimer versions of the peptides of the present invention.</p>A \" structural mimic\" of peptide YY is a peptide of the invention, which has substantially the same or an enhanced IC50 value when compared to peptide YY when measured as binding \n\nto receptor Y2 in the assay set forth in example 2 or binding to receptor Y5 in the assay set forth in example 3. This means that a structural mimic must exhibit an appetite-reducing or appetite-enhancing effect in vivo in humans or in an appropriate animal model, where peptide YY would also be effective.</p>A \"functional mimic\" of peptide YY is a peptide of the invention, which has substantially the same or an enhanced EC 50 value when compared to peptide YY when measured in the efficacy assay set forth in example 2. This means that a functional mimic must exhibit an appetite-reducing effect in vivo in humans or in an appropriate animal model, where peptide YY would also be effective.</p>A compound shall be considered to be 'conformationally constrained' to define the relative positions of amino acids 1 and 34 of SEQ ID NO 2 at least if it has a cross-link between an amino acid in the sector defined by amino acids 1-6 (preferably 1-5) of SEQ ID NO 2 and an amino acid in the sector defined by amino acids 12-30 (preferably 22-29) of SEQ ID NO 2. Also, a compound shall be considered to be 'conformationally constrained' to define the relative positions of amino acids 1 and 34 of SEQ ID NO 2 at least if it has substitutions of amino acids imposing a rigid bend substituted or added into SEQ ID NO 2 in the sector defined by amino acids 7-11 (preferably 9-10) of SEQ ID NO 2. A rigid bend shall be present at least if said substitution or addition provides in this region a dipeptide moiety A-B of the formula Gly-Gly, Pro-Gly, Gly-Pro, Sar-Sar, Sar-Hyp, Hyp-Sar, Pro-Sar, Sar-Pro, Pro- Hyp, Pro-Pro, Hyp-Pro, and Hyp-Hyp, where Pro and Hyp independently may be an L or D form, where the ring structure of Pro and Hyp is optionally substituted with halogen, nitro, methyl, amino, or phenyl, Hyp represents 3-hydroxyproline or 4-hydroxyproline, Sar represents sarcosine, or one or both of the amino acid residu",
    "s at least 20, at least 30, at least 40, at least 50, at least 60, at least 70, at least 80, at least 90, and at least 100.</p>However, some residual binding to the Yl receptor are expected for some specific peptide analogues of the invention, especially those where a large proportion of the N-terminus has been oreserved. Therefore, a peptide of the invention may have some binding to the Yl receptor, meaning that ratio between affinities for receptor Y2 or receptor Y5 and receptor Yl is at most 200, such as at most 190, at most 180, at most 170, at most 160, at most 150, at most 140, at most 130, at most 120, and at most 110.It will be understood however, that the affinity to the Yl and Y2 and Y5 receptors are not the only feature that will provide preferred peptides of the invention.</p>As mentioned above, the ultimately interesting parameter is the ability of the peptide of the invention to regulate appetite and thereby prove to be a feasible candidate for an anti-obesity drug or an appetite-enhancing drug. In other words, also peptides having formula I set forth above must preferably be structural and/or functional mimics of peptide YY, i.e. of the peptide having the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2. Structural mimicry of the peptides of the invention is, according to the present invention, preliminarily gauged in the 2 receptor binding assays that are described in example 2 and example 3. Preferred peptides of the invention in any or both of these two assays exhibit an IC50 value which is at least 40% of that of peptide YY, such as at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 100%, at least 110%, at least 120%, at least 130%, at least 140%, and at least 150% of the IC50 value of the peptide having the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2.</p>Functional mimicry of the peptides of the invention is, according to the present invention, preliminarily gauged in the efficacy assay described in example 2. Preferred peptides of the invention in these two assays exhibit an EC50 value which is at least 40%o of that of peptide YY, such as at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 100%, at least 110%, at least 120%, at least 130%, at least 140%, and at least 150% of the EC50 value of the peptide having the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2. In one embodiment the preferred peptides of the invention exhibit an EC50 &lt; 1 nM in the efficacy assay set forth in Example 2 and/or exhibits an IC50 &lt; 1 nM in the Y2 -binding assay set forth in Example 2 and/or exhibits an IC50 &lt; 1 nm in the Y5-binding assay set forth in Example 3. \n\n Preferred embodiments of peptides having formula I</p>In preferred variants of formula I, A<sup>29</sup> is Lys. Advantageously, Lys<sup>29</sup> is in these cases coupled to an amino acid sequence via a peptide bond at the \u03b5-amino group, preferably to a peptide having the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 23. However, this peptide coupled to Lys<sup>29</sup> may also be a truncate of SEQ ID NO: 23, where one or two of the C-terminal amino acids in SEQ ID NO: 23 has been deleted to leave only the 3-4 N-terminal amino acids thereof.</p>In preferred embodiments, especially for Y2 agonists, the peptide of formula I includes the disulfide bridge Cys<sup>3</sup>-S-S-Cys<sup>31</sup> and/or the disulfide bridge Cys<sup>3</sup>-S-S-Cys<sup>28</sup> and/or the disulfide bridge Cys<sup>5</sup>-S-S-Cys<sup>26</sup> and/or the disulfide bridge Cys<sup>7</sup>-S-S-Cys<sup>24</sup>. In some preferred embodiments, at most one of A<sup>24</sup>, A<sup>26</sup>, A<sup>28</sup>, and A<sup>31</sup> in formula I is Cys, meaning that at most one of the stabilising disulfide bridges can be formed between the N- and C- terminal parts of the peptide of the invention.</p>In the peptide having formula I, preferred embodiments include substituent X having the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 23. However, in a number of embodiments, X is absent.</p>In substituent Y, A and B, may independently be selected from the group consisting of N- and C",

The silver chloride was spun down by centrifugation and the clear supernatant loaded directly on the preparative HPLC and purified.</p>SEQ ID 20, SEQ ID 21, and SEQ ID 22 were assembled according to the \"general synthetic procedure\" described above using Fmoc-Lys(ivDde)-OH at position 8 from the C terminus in the backbone. The amino acid terminating the backbone was coupled as its Boc protected derivative. Then the ivDde group was removed from the epsilon amino group by treatment of the resin with 2% hydrazine hydrate in DMF for 3x3 min. After washing of the resin synthesis was continued as described above only that it was now the epsilon amino group on lysine onto which the growing peptide chain extended.</p>Results from the syntheses \n\n All masses were in accordance with theory \u00b1 0,5 Dalton</p>SEQ ID Yield# in % Rt \u00a7 in min MW mono</p>2 1.3 22.2 4047.07</p>3 2.1 20.1 4497.44</p>4 1.1 20.7 4815.64</p>6 14.5 18.8 4038.92</p>10 3 23.7 4126.12</p>11 5 22.5 4055.11</p>12 10.2 18.4 3525.71</p>13 10.7 17,5 3168.58</p>16 3 22.3 3039.58</p>17 7.8 20.6 3808.15</p>18 36 18.5 1888.05</p>19 17 15.5 2656.62</p>20 5.5 21.8 3591.94</p>21 3.5 18.4 2440.42</p>22 9.7 16.8 3141.79</p># purified yield relative to Resin load</p>\u00a7 Gradient as descibed in HPLC analytical.</p>EXAMPLE 2</p>Pre-screening of PYY analogues</p>The PYY analogues of the present invention are pre-screened in the following in vitro assays set forth in this and the following Example.</p>Yj_ and Y? receptor binding assay</p>Cell membranes (5-10 \u03bcg<sub>pro</sub>t) derived from SK-N-MC, SK-N-BE(2), SMS-KAN or brain cortex from adult rats are incubated with 0.2 nM [<sup>125</sup>I] {Leu3 l,Pro34}PYY (Yi - ligand) or</p>19 ^</p>0.2 nM [ I]PYY<sub>3</sub>.<sub>36</sub> (Y<sub>2</sub> - ligand) in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of \n\n test peptides in 200 \u03bcl binding buffer (50 mM HEPES, 2.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, &amp; 0.1% BSA, pH 7.2).
