Expression of the marker gene in response to induction or selection usually indicates expression of \u039dMB polynucleotide.<sub>.</sub></p>\n  Alternatively, host cells which contain a \u039dMB polynucleotide and which express \u039dMB can be identified by a variety of procedures known to those of skill in the art. These procedures include, but are not limited to, D\u039dA-D\u039dA or D\u039dA-R\u039dA hybridizations and protein bioassay or immunoassay techniques which include membrane, solution, or chip-based technologies for the detection and/or quantification of nucleic acid or protein. For example, the presence of a polynucleotide sequence encoding \u039dMB can be detected by D\u039dA-D\u039dA or D\u039dA-R\u039dA hybridization or amplification using probes or fragments or fragments of polynucleotides encoding \u039dMB. Nucleic acid amplification-based assays involve the use of oligonucleotides selected from sequences encoding NMB to detect transformants which contain a</p>\n  NMB polynucleotide. \n\nA variety of protocols for detecting and measuring the expression of NMB, using either polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies specific for the polypeptide, are known in the art. Examples include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radio- immunoassay (RIA), and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). A two-site, monoclonal-based immunoassay using monoclonal antibodies reactive to two non- interfering epitopes on NMB can be used, or a competitive binding assay can be employed.</p>\n  A wide variety of labels and conjugation techniques are known by those skilled in the art and can be used in various nucleic acid and amino acid assays. Means for producing labeled hybridization or PCR probes for detecting sequences related to polynucleotides encoding NMB include oligolabeling, nick translation, end-labeling, or PCR amplification using a labeled nucleotide. Alternatively, sequences encoding NMB can be cloned into a vector for the production of an mRNA probe. Such vectors are known in the art, are commercially available, and can be used to synthesize RNA probes in vitro by addition of labeled nucleotides and an appropriate RNA polymerase such as T7, T3, or SP6. These procedures can be conducted using a variety of commercially available kits (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Promega, and US Biochemical). Suitable reporter molecules or labels which can be used for ease of detection include radionuclides, enzymes, and fluorescent, chemiluminescent, or chromogenic agents, as well as substrates, cofactors, inhibitors, magnetic particles, and the like.</p>\n  Expression and Purification of Polypeptides</p>\n  Host cells transformed with NMB polynucleotides can be cultured under conditions suitable for the expression and recovery of the protein from cell culture. The polypeptide produced by a transformed cell can be secreted or contained intra- cellularly depending on the sequence and/or the vector used. As will be understood by those of",

The methods entail the identification of candidate or test compounds or agents (e.g., peptides, peptidomimetics, small molecules or other molecules) which bind to NMB and/or have a stimulatory or inhibitory effect on the biological activity of NMB or its expression and then determining which of these compounds have an effect on symtoms or diseases regarding the hematological and cardiovascular diseases, \n\n disorders of the peripheral and central nervous system, COPD, asthma, genito- urological disorders and inflammation diseases in an in vivo assay.</p>\n  Candidate or test compounds or agents which bind to NMB and/or have a stimulatory or inhibitory effect on the activity or the expression of NMB are identified either in assays that employ cells which express NMB on the cell surface (cell-based assays) or in assays with isolated NMB (cell-free assays). The various assays can employ a variety of variants of NMB (e.g., full-length NMB, a biologically active fragment of NMB, or a fusion protein which includes all or a portion of NMB). Moreover, NMB can be derived from any suitable mammalian species (e.g., human NMB, rat NMB or murine NMB). The assay can be a binding assay entailing direct or indirect measurement of the binding of a test compound or a known NMB ligand to NMB. The assay can also be an activity assay entailing direct or indirect measurement of the activity of NMB. The assay can also be an expression assay entailing direct or indirect measurement of the expression of NMB mRNA or NMB protein. The various screening assays are combined with an in vivo assay entailing measuring the effect of the test compound on the symtoms of hematological and cardiovascular diseases, disorders of the peripheral and central nervous system, COPD, asthma, genito-urological disorders and inflammation diseases.</p>\n  In one embodiment, the invention provides assays for screening candidate or test compounds which bind to or modulate the activity of a membrane-bound (cell</p>\n  ' surface expressed) form of NMB. Such assays can employ full-length NMB, a biologically active fragment of NMB, or a fusion protein which includes all or a portion of NMB. As described in greater detail below, the test compound can be obtained by any suitable means, e.g., from conventional compound libraries. Determining the ability of the test compound to bind to a membrane-bound form of NMB can be accomplished, for example, by coupling the test compound with a radioisotope or enzymatic label such that binding of the test compound to the NMB - expressing cell can be measured by detecting the labeled compound in a complex.</p>\n  For example, the test compound can be l",

A two-site monoclonal-based immunoassay utilizing monoclonal antibodies reactive to two non-interfering epitopes on NMB is preferred, but a competitive binding assay may be employed.</p>\n  Example 9: Purification of Native NMB Using Specific Antibodies</p>\n  Native or recombinant NMB is purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using antibodies specific for NMB. In general, an immunoaffinity column is constructed by covalently coupling the anti-TRH antibody to an activated chromatographic resin.</p>\n  Polyclonal immunoglobulins are prepared from immune sera either by precipitation with ammonium sulfate or by purification on immobilized Protein A (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, Piscataway. N.J.). Likewise, monoclonal antibodies are prepared from mouse ascites fluid by ammonium sulfate precipitation or chromatography on immobilized Protein A. Partially purified immunoglobulin is covalently attached to a chromatographic resin such as CnBr-activated Sepharose</p>\n  (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology). The antibody is coupled to, the resin, the resin is \n\nblocked, and the derivative resin is washed according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p>\n  Such immunoaffimty columns are utilized in the purification of NMB by preparing a fraction from cells containing NMB in a soluble form. This preparation is derived by solubilization of whole cells or of a subcellular fraction obtained via differential centrifugation (with or without addition of detergent) or by other methods well known in the art.
