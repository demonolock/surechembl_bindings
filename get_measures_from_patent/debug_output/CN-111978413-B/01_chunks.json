    "150nm mitotracker fan Red molecular probes (mitochondrial Red fluorescent probes), and collected on a Canto II flow cytometer (Becton). The plates were incubated with the dye at room temperature for 20 minutes in the dark, washed twice with 200. mu.L of PBS each time, and then transferred to a 3mL round bottom polystyrene tube (Becton Dickinson) for collection. Monoclonal antibody Fy 62C 3 (murine anti-Fy 6) and polyclonal antibody FyB were used as intrusion inhibition controls. Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc.) in which individual cells were gated. The values indicated in the double positive population Hoechst 34580+ MitoTracker Far Red + were exported to Excel software and analyzed using FlowJo software.</p>Results as shown in figure 3 and table 1, among all antibodies, PvMSP8+ 1-specific antibody inhibited the IC of cynomolgus monkey plasmodium growth in vitro<sub>50</sub>The value was 0.9459ug/mL, whereas the IC of PvMSP8 and PvMSP1-19 monoclonal antibodies<sub>50</sub>The values are 4.402ug/mL and 1.598ug/mL respectively; IC of positive control antibodies Fy 62C 3 and FyB<sub>50</sub>The values were 13.14ug/mL and 7.239ug/mL, respectively. Therefore, the PvMSP8+1 specific antibody improves the inhibition efficiency of the PvMSP8 and PvMSP1-19 monoclonal antibodies when acting alone, and has good application prospect.</p>TABLE 1 IC for in vitro inhibition of growth of Plasmodium cynomolgus monkey by different antibodies<sub>50</sub>Value of</p></p>IC 50: half maximal inhibitory concentration</p>Although the present invention has been described with reference to the preferred embodiments, it should be understood that various changes and modifications can be made therein by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.</p>SEQUENCE LISTING</p>&lt;110&gt; university of south of the Yangtze river</p>&lt;120&gt; an antibody for inhibiting the growth of plasmodium of cynomolgus monkey in vitro</p>&lt;130&gt; BAA200778A</p>&lt;160&gt; 2</p>&lt;170&gt; PatentIn version 3.3</p>&lt;210&gt; 1</p>&lt;211&gt; 711</p>&lt;212&gt; DNA</p>&lt;213&gt; Artificial sequence</p>&lt;400&gt; 1</p>atgtctttaa agaaaattct gaaaatcgtg gatgaaatgg aaaacatcca aggtttactg 60</p>gatggcgact attctattct ggataaatat agcgtgaaac tggttgacga ggatgatggc 120</p>gagaccaaca agcgcaagat catcggcgag tacgatttaa agatgctgaa gaacatttta 180</p>ctgttccgcg agaaaatcag ccgcgtgtgc gaaaataaat ataacaaaaa tttaccggtg 240</p>ctgctgaaaa agtgcagcaa cgtggacgac cctaaactga gcaagagtcg cgagaagatc 300</p>aagaagggtt tagcaaaaaa caatatgagc attgaggatt tcgtggtggg cttactggaa 360</p>gatctgtttg aaaaaattaa cgaacacttt atcaaaggcg gtggcggcag tggtggcggt 420</p>ggtagtggcg gcggtggcag cagcaaactg attaaggaga acgagagcaa ggagattctg 480</p>agccagctgc tgaacgtgca gacccagctg ctgaccatga gcagcgagca cacttgtatt 540</p>gacacaaatg tgccggataa cgccgcatgc tatcgctatc tggacggtac cgaagaatgg 600</p>cgctgtttac tgacctttaa agaagagggc ggtaagtgcg tgccggccag caatgtgaca "
