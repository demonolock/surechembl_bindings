    "functional derivatives thereof, may comprise the active ingredient of pharmaceutical compositions for protecting mammals from the deleterious effects of TNF. These compositions are yet another aspect of the present invention.</p>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONAs stated hereinbefore, TNF exists and exerts its biological action as a trimer. However, nothing has been known so far as to the form of the TNF-Rs to which TNF binds, i.e. whether the TNF trimer binds to individual molecules of the TNF-Rs, or the receptors themselves also exist as multimers or become multimers following TNF binding which better accommodates the TNF trimers.</p>We have now found that the TNF-Rs exist in aggregated forms in cells exposed to TNF.</p>This was shown by analysis of full-length and C-terminal truncated forms of the human p55-TNF-Rs tagged by cross-linking to labelled TNF. For this purpose we produced truncated forms of the human p55-TNF-R by site-directed mutagenesis of the cDNA and expressed them in murine A9 cells. Radiolabelled TNF was applied on these cells and cross-linked chemically to the TNF-Rs. The TNF-Rs were solubilized with a detergent, and antibodies specific to the human receptors were applied to immunoprecipitate the human receptors, examining thereby whether murine receptors associate noncovalently with the human receptor as a consequence of aggregation of the receptors.</p>TBP-I and TBP-II monomers must be administered in very high doses in order to result in effective inhibition of TNF-binding to cells in the human body. The multimers of the soluble forms of TNF-Rs according to the invention, are believed to be more effective in inhibiting TNF activity at lower doses, since they can effectively compete with the TNF trimers for the binding sites on the aggregates of the cell surface TNF-Rs.</p>The multimers of the soluble forms of the TNF-Rs may be produced chemically by using known methods which will result in the formation of either dimers or higher multimers of the soluble forms of the TNF-Rs.</p>Another way of producing the multimers of the soluble forms of the TNF-Rs is by recombinant techniques. In this way, massive production of multimers with optimal TNF binding activity will be made possible.</p>The multimers of the present invention have the ability to interfere with the binding of TNF to its receptors and/or to block the effects of TNF. Each multimer comprises two or more monomers, each comprising the soluble form of a TNF-R or a salt or functional derivative thereof. The upper limit for the number of monomers in a multimer is not important and liposomes having many such monomers thereon may be used. Such multimers preferably have 2-5 monomers and more preferably 2 or 3.</p>Each monomer of the multimer is a soluble form of a TNF-R or a salt or functional derivative thereof. Preferably, the monomers are TBP-I and/or TBP-II or their salts or functional derivatives. More preferably, each monomer is a protein having an amino acid seq",
    "M KCl, and two times with PBS. The beads were resuspended in 15 \u03bcl sample buffer containing 4% (w/v) SDS and 6% (v/v) \u03b2-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 3 min. The superantant was analysed by SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide) followed by autoradiography.</p>As shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B, the receptors for TNF exist in aggregated forms in cells exposed to TNF. These figures present the SDS-PAGE analysis of the full-length and truncated forms of the human p55-TNF-Rs (see the schematic representation of the different forms in FIG. 2) expressed in murine A9 cells and tagged by applying the radio-labelled TNF on the cells followed by cross-linking.</p>The receptors were immunoprecipitated from detergent extracts of the cells following acidification of the extracts, in order to dissociate non-covalent aggregates of proteins (A) or without such acidification (B). The patterns of the labelled proteins, precipitated from extracts of HeLa cells (lane 1), from extracts of non-transfected A9 cells (lane 2), from extracts of A9 cells expressing the wild type human p55-TNF-R (3), and from extracts of A9 cells expressing the \u0394:310-426 human p55-TNF-R (4), the \u0394:244-426 human p55-TNF-R (5) and the \u0394:215:426 human p55-TNF-R (6) mutants are shown in comparison to the migration of molecular weight markers (Mr). Labelled bands whose sizes correspond to the expressed human receptors, tagged by cross-linking to either one or to two labelled TNF molecules, are denoted with solid arrows (sizes of 72 and 89 kD for the full length receptor, 59 and 76 kD for t he \u0394:310-426 human p55-TNF-R, 51 and 68 kD for the \u0394:244-426 human p55-TNF-R and 48 and 65 kD for the \u0394:215:426 human p55-TNF-R). The labelled bands whose sizes correspond to the full-length murine receptors, cross-linked either to one or to two TNF molecules (72 and 89 kD) are denoted with empty arrows, and the bands which correspond to cross-linked monomers, dimers and trimers of TNF (17, 34 and 51 kilodaltons)--by stippled lines.</p>The antibodies applied for immunoprecipitation in this analysis of the receptor size, recognized specifically the receptors of human origin (solid arrows). These antibodies did not precipitate TNF receptors from extracts of non-transfected A9 cells (compare lanes 1 and 2). However, in application of these antibodies to extracts of the A9 cells which express the human p55-TNF-R, it was found that, together with the human receptors, the antibodies precipitated also some of the murine receptors, which were easily distinguishable from the truncated human receptors by their full length size (empty arrows) (lanes 3-6 in FIG. 1B), implying that the TNF receptors exist in the cells as aggregates, containing both receptors of human and of murine origin. Consistently with this notion, it was found that if, prior to immunoprecipitation, the cell extracts were exposed to low pH, in order to disrupt non-covalent association between the receptors, the human receptors could still be precipitated. However, the precipitation of the murine receptors was abolished (compare FIG. 1A to FIG. 1B).</p>EXAMPLE 2A. Construction of Mutant p55-TNF-RsThe cDNA of the human TNF-RI (see EP application 90 12 4133.1) was cut with BanII (at nucleotides 218-222) and NheI (at nucleotides 1723 and 1728), resulting in removal of large parts of the ",
    "xpression of the Wild Type and the Mutant Receptors in Cultured CellsCells of murine A9, L929, NiH3T3 and the hamster BHK lines were cultured with Dulbecco's Minimal Essential Medium (DMEM), containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomucin. The expression constructs encoding the wild type and the mutant receptors were cotransfected together with the neomycin resistance conferring plasmid pSV2neo into these cells, using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. After 10 to 14 days selection in growth medium containing 500 \u03bcg/ml G418, resistant colonies were isolated and checked for expression of the human p55 TNF-R by measuring TNF binding to the cells.</p>FIG. 2 illustrates the structure of the wild type human p55-TNF-receptor. It consists of icons depicting the full length human p55-TNF-R and the truncated forms of this receptor created by site-directed mutagenesis. Using these oligonucleotides, stop codons were introduced into the intracellular domain of the receptor at amino acids 310 (the \u0394:310-426 human p55-TNF-R mutant), 244 (the \u0394:244-426 human p55-TNF-R mutant), and 215 (the \u0394:215:426 human p55-TNF-R mutant).</p>FIGS. 3 and 4 provide further evidence for the existence of the cell-surface TNF-R as aggregates as well as for two other points, namely that aggregation of functional receptors is necessary for the activity of these receptors, as well as that involvement of non-functional receptors in this aggregation results in effective inhibition of TNF function.</p>FIG. 3 illustrates the cytocidal effects of TNF (A) and of monoclonal antibodies against the human p55-TNF-R (B) in A9 cells, in A9 cells expressing the full length human p55-TNF-R, and in A9 cells expressing the cytoplasmic deletion mutants of the human p55-TNF-R (the \u0394:310-426 human p55-TNF-R, the \u0394:244-426 human p55-TNF-R, and the \u0394:215:426 human p55-TNF-R.</p>Cells were seeded into 96-well plates, 24 hrs. before the assay, at a density of 30,000 cells/well. The TNF and the monoclonal antibodies, were applied simultaneously with CHI (50 \u03bcg/ml). After further 11 hrs. incubation at 37\u00b0 C., viability of the cells was assessed in a neutral red uptake assay. The two monoclonal antibodies were applied at equal amounts which summed up to the concentration specified in the figure.</p>Turning now to FIG. 4, the cytocidal effect of TNF, applied together with cyctoheximide (CHI) (50 \u03bcg/ml to A9 cells (A), A9 cells expressing the \u0394:310-426 human p55-TNF-R (B) and A9 cells expressing the \u0394:215:426 hum,an p55-TNF-R (C), was examined in the presence and absence of antibodies to the human p55-TNF-R. Similar sensitization by the antibodies to the cytocidal effect of TNF was observed in A9 cells expressing the \u0394:244-426 human p66-TNF-R mutant.</p>Thus, while having a pronounced cytocidal effect in the A9 cells which express the full-length human p55-TNF-R, the antibodies had no effect at all in cells expressing any of the three truncated forms of the receptor,",
    " Avidin may be replaced with Streptavidin, the procedure itself remaining the same.</p>d) Formation of multimers of the soluble receptors by cross-linking cysteines located within the receptor's sequence:</p>Such multimers of TNF receptors are formed by linking the molecules of soluble forms of the TNF-Rs to each other using cross-linking reagents specific to amine groups or to thiols. (The later following partial reduction of the cysteines in the soluble receptors with \u03b2-mercapthoethanol or dithiothreitol).</p>e) Formation of liposomes containing multiple molecules of the truncated receptors:</p>Procedure I: Liposomes expressing any Biotin-containing protein on their surface can be applied for that purpose. Soluble forms of the TNF-Rs to whose C-termini Biotin was linked, are linked to these liposomes with the use of (the tetravalent) Avidin.</p>Procedure II: Recombinant TNF receptors, truncated in the intracellular domains, but containing the transmembrane domains, are produced as described in Example 2. They are then incorporated into liposomes by dissociation in detergents, followed by their reconstitution in the presence of lipids by removal of the detergents.</p>f) Isolation of soluble receptor multimers with highest inhibitory effect on TNF function:</p>Preparations of soluble receptor dimers or multimers are fractionated chromatographically, and fractions showing highest inhibitory effects on TNF function are further analyzed, to define the structures optimal for TNF inhibition. Alternatively, affinity purification of the optimal inhibitors is performed, by applying preparations of soluble receptor dimers or multimers to TNF-affinity columns.</p>EXAMPLE 4Creation of Recombinant DNA Molecules Comprising Nucleotide Sequences Coding for the Multimers of the Soluble TNF-Rs and their ExpressionThe dimers and higher multimers of the soluble receptors can also be prepared by genetic engineering techniques and their preparation encompasses all the tools used in these techniques. Thus DNA molecules are provided which comprise the nucleotide sequence coding for such dimers or oligomers. These DNA molecules can be genomic DNA, cDNA, synthetic DNA and a combination thereof.</p>Creation of DNA molecules coding for a dimer of soluble receptors is carried out by ligating the cDNA sequence encoding the soluble form of a TNF-R to a sequence encoding a linker peptide and then further to a synthetic polynucleotide encoding the translation of the soluble receptor in the reverse orientation--from the original C-terminus to the N-terminus and lacking the sequence of the leader peptide.</p>Polymeric forms of the soluble receptors can be created, as mentioned above, by forming recombinant truncated receptors, deficient of intracellular domains but containing transmembrane domains, and incorporating them, by membrane reconstitution techniques, into liposomes.</p>Expression of the recombinant proteins can be effected in eukaryotic cells, bacteria or yeasts, using "
