Generally, the dose begins with an amount somewhat less than the optimum dose and it is increased by small increments thereafter until the desired or optimum effect is achieved relative to any negative side effects. Important diagnostic measures include those of symptoms of, e.g., the inflammation or level of inflammatory cytokines produced. Preferably, a biologic that will be used is derived from the same species as the animal targeted for treatment, thereby minimizing a humoral response to the reagent. </p> [61] Methods for co-administration or treatment with a second therapeutic agent, e.g., a cytokine, steroid, chemotherapeutic agent, antibiotic, or radiation, are well known in the art (see, e.g., Hardman, et al.

(2001) Cancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy, Lippincott, Williams &amp; Wilkins, Phila., PA). An effective amount of therapeutic will decrease the symptoms, e.g., tumor size or inhibition of tumor growth, typically by at least 10%; usually by at least 20%; preferably at least about 30%; more preferably at least 40%, and most preferably by at least 50%. </p> [62] The present invention provides methods of treating a proliferative condition or disorder, e.g., cancer of the uterus, cervix, breast, prostate, testes, penis, gastrointestinal tract, e.g., esophagus, oropharynx, stomach, small or large intestines, colon, or rectum, kidney, renal \n\n cell, bladder, bone, bone marrow, skin, head or neck, skin, liver, gall bladder, heart, lung, pancreas, salivary gland, adrenal gland, thyroid, brain, e.g. gliomas, ganglia, central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS), and immune system, e.g., spleen or thymus. The present invention provides methods of treating, e.g., immunogenic tumors, non- immunogenic tumors, dormant tumors, virus-induced cancers, e.g., epithelial cell cancers, endothelial cell cancers, squamous cell carcinomas, papillomavirus, adenocarcinomas, lymphomas, carcinomas, melanomas, leukemias, myelomas, sarcomas, terato carcinomas, chemically-induced cancers, metastasis, and angiogenesis.

XII. Measurement of IL-10 Polypeptide Activity and Affinity of IL-10 Polypeptide or the IL-10 Receptor </p> [578] IL-10 polypeptide activity can be determined using standard or known in vitro or in vivo assays. IL-10 polypeptides may be analyzed for biological activity by suitable methods known in the art. Such assays include, but are not limited to, activation of IL-10 -responsive genes, receptor binding assays, anti-viral activity assays, cytopathic effect inhibition assays, (Familletti et. al., Meth. Enzymol. 78:387-394), anti-proliferative assays, (Aebersold and Sample, Meth. Enzymol. 119:579-582), immunomodulatory assays (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,914,033; 4,753,795), and assays that monitor the induction of MHC molecules (e.g., Hokland et al, Meth. Enzymol. 119:688-693), as described in Meager, J. Immunol. Meth., 261 :21-36 (2002). </p>[579] IL-10 polypeptides may be analyzed for their ability to activate IL-10-sensitive signal transduction pathways. One example is the interferon- stimulated response element (ISRE) assay. Cells which constitutively express the IL-10 receptor are transiently transfected with an ISRE-luciferase vector (pISRE-luc, Clontech). After transfection, the cells are treated with an IL-10 polypeptide. A number of protein concentrations, for example from 0.0001-10 ng/niL, are \n\n tested to generate a dose-response curve. If the IL-10 polypeptide binds and activates the IL-10 receptor, the resulting signal transduction cascade induces luciferase expression. Luminescence can be measured in a number of ways, for example by using a TopCount\u2122 or Fusion\u2122 microplate reader and Steady-Glo<sup>R</sup> Luciferase Assay System (Promega). </p>[580] IL-10 polypeptides may be analyzed for their ability to bind to the IL- 10 receptor.</p>For a non-PEGylated or PEGylated IL- 10 polypeptide comprising a non-natural amino acid, the affinity of IL-10 for its receptor can be measured by using a BIAcore\u2122 biosensor (Pharmacia).

In an analogous manner an IL-10 polypeptide may be coupled to one or more other polypeptides to form heterodimers, homomultimers, or heteromuitimer s. Coupling, purification, and analyses are performed as in the above examples. </p>Example 14 </p> PEG-OH + Br-(CH<sub>2</sub>)n-C=CR' PEG-0-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>~C\u2261CR' </p> A B </p> [704] The polyalkylene glycol (P-OH) is reacted with the alkyl halide (A) to form the ether (B).

R<sup>!</sup> can also be a C3 to C7 saturated or unsaturated cyclic alkyl or cyclic heteroalkyl, a substituted or unsubstituted aryl or heteroaryl group, or a substituted or unsubstituted alkaryl (the alkyl is a CI to C20 saturated or unsaturated alkyl) or heteroalkaryl group.
