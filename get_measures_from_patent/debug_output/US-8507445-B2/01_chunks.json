    "ate tissue. The homology of the RRAGGS (SEQ ID NO:34) motif with human IL-11 suggests that the native prostate receptor for binding of RRAGGS (SEQ ID NO:34) may be the IL-11 receptor. The present Example determined whether the IL-11 receptor could be targeted in prostate cancer, including metastatic prostate cancer.</p>To test the tissue specificity of the IL-11 peptide mimic, a phage overlay assay was developed to evaluate receptor-ligand interactions in tissue sections, using the motif RRAGGS (SEQ ID NO:34) (Arap et al., Nature Med. 8:121-127, 2002). Phage overlay on human tissue sections showed that the prostate-homing phage displaying an IL-11 peptide mimic specifically bound to the endothelium and epithelium of normal prostate, but not to control organs, such as skin (data not shown). In contrast, a control phage that localized to skin tissue, displaying the motif HGGVG (SEQ ID NO:36), did not bind to prostate tissue (not shown). However, the control phage specifically recognized blood vessels in the skin (not shown).</p>The immunostaining pattern obtained with an antibody against human IL-11R\u03b1 (IL-11 receptor alpha) on normal prostate tissue was indistinguishable from that of a CGRRAGGSC (SEQ ID NO:37)-displaying phage overlay (not shown). In contrast, a control antibody showed no staining in prostate tissue (not shown). These findings were recapitulated in multiple tissue sections obtained from several different patients (Arap et al., 2002).</p>Using a ligand-receptor binding assay in vitro, the interaction of the CGRRAGGSC (SEQ ID NO:37)-displaying phage with immobilized IL-11R\u03b1 was demonstrated at the protein-protein level (not shown). Recombinant IL-11R\u03b1 vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR1) or leptin receptor (OB\u2014R) were incubated with phage displaying the CGRRAGGSC (SEQ ID NO:37) peptide. VEGFR1 was used as a representative vascular receptor, while OB\u2014R was used because it shares a co-receptor with IL-11R\u03b1. An unrelated phage clone displaying the peptide CRVDFSKGC (SEQ ID NO:38) and insertless fd-tet phage were used as controls. Only the IL-11R\u03b1 receptor protein exhibited a significant amount of binding to CGRRAGGSC (SEQ ID NO:37)-phage (not shown). Neither OB\u2014R nor VEGFR1 showed binding to CGRRAGGSC (SEQ ID NO:37)-phage above control levels (not shown). Neither of the control phage exhibited selective binding to IL-11R\u03b1 (not shown). Binding of CGRRAGGSC (SEQ ID NO:37)-phage to IL-11R\u03b1 was specific, since it was inhibited by the native IL-11 ligand in a concentration-dependent manner (not shown). Close to 100% inhibition of CGRRAGGSC (SEQ ID NO:37)-phage binding was observed at a peptide concentration of about 0.1 nM (not shown). These observations with normal prostate tissues were followed by an examination of the expression of IL-11R\u03b1 in tumors, as discussed in the present Example. IL-11R expression was found to be upregulated in human prostate cancer (see below).</p>Characteristics of IL-11 Receptor</p>IL-11R\u03b1 is a",
