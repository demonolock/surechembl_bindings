{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nA compound is considered an agonist if it induces at least 50% of the level of GTP binding induced by propionate when the compound is present at 1 \u03bcM or less, and preferably will induce a level the same as or higher than that induced by propionate. \nFor GTP binding assays, membranes isolated from cells expressing the receptor are incubated in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, and 10 mM MgCl2, 80 pM <sup>35</sup>S-GTP\u03b3S and 3 \u03bcM GDP. \nA decrease of 10% or more in the binding of propionate or other ligand indicates that the sample contains an agent that modulates propionate or ligand binding to the receptor polypeptide. \nAn increase of 10% or more in labelled GTP binding as measured by scintillation counting in an assay of this kind containing a candidate modulator, relative to an assay without the modulator, indicates that the candidate modulator inhibits GPR43 activity. \nA change (increase or decrease) of 10% or more in the level of GTP binding or GTPase activity relative to samples without modulator is indicative of GPR43 modulation by a candidate modulator."}
