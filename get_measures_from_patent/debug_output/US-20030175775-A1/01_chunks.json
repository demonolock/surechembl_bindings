    "0051] Another aspect of the present invention is related to the use of a specific active portion of the sequences. As used herein, an \u201cactive portion\u201d refers to a portion of a sequence that is of sufficient size to exhibit normal or near normal pharmacology (e.g., receptor activity (as defined herein), the response to an activator or inhibitor, or ligand binding are at least 90% of the level of activity, response, or binding exhibited by a wild type receptor). \u201cA portion\u201d as it refers to a sequence encoding a receptor, refers to less than 100% of the sequence (i.e., 99, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50% etc . . . ). The active portion could be a receptor which comprises a partial deletion of the complete nucleotide or amino acid sequence and which still maintains the active site(s) and protein domain(s) necessary for the binding of and interaction with a specific ligand, preferably acetate and propionate. </p>[0052] In another embodiment of any of the preceding methods, the contacting is performed in or on synthetic liposomes (Mirzabekov et al., 2000) or virus-induced budding membranes containing a GPR43 polypeptide. (see Patent application WO0102551, Virus-like particles, their Preparation and their Use preferably in Pharmaceutical Screening and Functional Genomics (2001) incorporated herein by reference). </p>[0053] As used herein, \u201cligand\u201d refers to a moiety that is capable of associating or binding to a receptor. According to the method of the invention, a ligand and a receptor have a binding constant that is sufficiently strong to allow detection of binding by an assay method that is appropriate for detection of a ligand binding to a receptor (e.g. a second messenger assay to detect an increase or decrease in the production of a second messenger in response to ligand binding to the receptor, a binding assay to measure protein-ligand binding or an immunoassay to measure antibody-antigen interactions). A ligand according to the invention includes the actual molecule that binds a receptor (e.g. propionate is the ligand for GPR43) or a ligand may be any nucleotide, antibody, antigen, enzyme, peptide, polypeptide or nucleic acid capable of binding to the receptor. A ligand is preferably a short chain carboxylic acid but can also include a polypeptide, a peptide or a nucleic acid sequence. According to the method of the invention, a ligand and receptor specifically bind to each other (e.g. via covalent or hydrogen bonding or via an interaction between, for example, a protein and a ligand, an antibody and an antigen or protein subunits). </p>[0054] Another aspect of the present invention is related to a method for the screening, detection and recovery of candidate modulators of a receptor of the invention comprising the steps of: contacting a cell expressing GPR43 with an SCFA under conditions which permit binding of acetate or propionate to GPR43, in the presence of the candidate modulator, performing a second messenger assay, and comparing the results of the second messenger assay obtained in the presence and absence of the candidate modulator. </p>[0055] Another aspect of the present invention is related to a method for the screening, detection and possible recovery of candidate modulators of a receptor of the invention comprising the steps of: contacting a cell membra",
    "or of the invention that is expressed in a cell will bind propionate with an affinity that is at least 100-fold, preferably 500-fold and most preferably 1000-fold greater than the affinity for IDP and UDP. </p>[0171] According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a cell is selected from the group consisting of COS7-cells, a CHO cell, a LM (TK\u2212) cell, a NIH-3T3 cell, HEK-293 cell, K-562 cell or a 1321N1 astrocytoma cell but also other transfectable cell lines. </p>[0172] Assays </p>[0173] I. Assays for the Identification of Agents that Modulate the Activity of GPR43 </p>[0174] Agents that modulate the activity of GPR43 can be identified in a number of ways that take advantage of the newly discovered interaction of the receptor with SCFAs, such as acetete and propionate. For example, the ability to reconstitute GPR43/propionate binding either in vitro, on cultured cells or in vivo provides a target for the identification of agents that disrupt that binding. Assays based on disruption of binding can identify agents, such as small organic molecules, from libraries or collections of such molecules. Alternatively, such assays can identify agents in samples or extracts from natural sources, e.g., plant, fungal or bacterial extracts or even in human tissue samples (e.g., tumor tissue). In one aspect, the extracts can be made from cells expressing a library of variant nucleic acids, peptides or polypeptides. Modulators of GPR43/SCFA binding can then be screened using a binding assay or a functional assay that measures downstream signalling through the receptor. </p>[0175] Another approach that uses the GPR43/SCFA interaction more directly to identify agents that modulate GPR43 function measures changes in GPR43 downstream signalling induced by candidate agents or candidate modulators. These functional assays can be performed in isolated cell membrane fractions or on cells expressing the receptor on their surfaces. </p>[0176] The discovery that SCFAs, such as acetate and propionate are ligands of the GPR43 receptor permits screening assays to identify agonists, antagonists and inverse agonists of receptor activity. The screening assays have two general approaches, detailed below. For the purposes of this section propionate is used as an exemplary SCFA. It should be understood, however, that any SCFA as defined herein can be used in the assays described. </p>[0177] 1) Ligand binding assays, in which cells expressing GPR43, membrane extracts from such cells, or immobilized lipid membranes comprising GPR43 are exposed to labelled and candidate compound. Following incubation, the reaction mixture is measured for specific binding of the labelled to the GPR43 receptor. Compounds that interfere with binding or displace labelled can be agonists, antagonists or inverse agonists of GPR43 activity. Subsequent functional analysis can then be performed on positive compounds to determine in which of these categories they belong. </p>[0178] 2) Functional a",
    "bits the interaction of GPR43 and propionate. It is important to note that in assays testing the interaction of GPR43 with propionate, it is possible that a modulator of the interaction need not necessarily interact directly with the domain(s) of the proteins that physically interact with propionate. It is also possible that a modulator will interact at a location removed from the site of interaction and cause, for example, a conformational change in the GPR43 polypeptide. Modulators (inhibitors or agonists) that act in this manner are nonetheless of interest as agents to modulate the activity of GPR43. </p>[0192] It should be understood that any of the binding assays described herein can be performed with a non-propionate ligand (for example, agonist, antagonist, etc.) of GPR43, e.g., a small molecule identified as described herein or propionate analogues including but not limited to any of the propionate analogues, a natural or synthetic peptide, a polypeptide, an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof, a lipid, a carbohydrate, and a small organic molecule. </p>[0193] Any of the binding assays described can be used to determine the presence of an agent in a sample, e.g., a tissue sample, that binds to the GPR43 receptor molecule, or that affects the binding of propionate to the receptor. To do so, GPR43 polypeptide is reacted with propionate or another ligand in the presence or absence of the sample, and propionate or ligand binding is measured as appropriate for the binding assay being used. A decrease of 10% or more in the binding of propionate or other ligand indicates that the sample contains an agent that modulates propionate or ligand binding to the receptor polypeptide. </p>[0194] Functional Assays of Receptor Activity </p>[0195] i. GTPase/GTP Binding Assays: </p>[0196] For GPCRs such as GPR43, a measure of receptor activity is the binding of GTP by cell membranes containing receptors. In the method described by Traynor and Nahorski, 1995, Mol. Pharmacol. 47: 848-854, incorporated herein by reference, one essentially measures G-protein coupling to membranes by detecting the binding of labelled GTP. For GTP binding assays, membranes isolated from cells expressing the receptor are incubated in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, and 10 mM MgCl2, 80 pM <sup>35</sup>S-GTP\u03b3S and 3 \u03bcM GDP. The assay mixture is incubated for 60 minutes at 30\u00b0 C., after which unbound labelled GTP is removed by filtration onto GF/B filters. Bound, labelled GTP is measured by liquid scintillation counting. In order to assay for modulation of propionate-induced GPR43 activity, membranes prepared from cells expressing a GPR43 polypeptide are mixed with propionate, and the GTP binding assay is performed in the presence and absence of a candidate modulator of GPR43 activity. An increase of 10% or more in labelled GTP binding as measured by scintillation counting in an assay of this kind containing a candidate modulator, relative to an assay without the modulator, indicates that the candidate modulator inhibits GPR43 activity. A similar GTP-binding assay can be performed without propionate to identify compounds that act as agonists. In this case, propionate-stimulated GTP binding is used as a standard. A compound is considered an agonist if it induces at least 50% of the level of GTP binding induced by propionate when the compound is present at 1 \u03bcM or less, and preferably will induce a level the same as or higher than that induced by propionate. GTPase activity is measured by incubating the membranes containing a GPR43 polypeptide with \u03b3<sup>32</sup>P-GTP. Active GTPase will release the label as inorganic phosphate, which is detected by separation of free inorganic phosphate in a 5% suspension of activated charcoal in 20 mM H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, followed by scintillation counting. Controls include assays using membranes isolated from cells not expressing GPR43 (mock-transfected), in order to exclude possible non-specific effects of the candidate compound. </p>[0197] In order to assay for the effect of a candidate modulator on GPR43-regulated GTPase activity, membrane samples are incubated with propionate, with and without the modulator, followed by the GTPase assay. A change (increase or decrease) of 10% or more in the level of GTP binding or GTPase activity relative to samples without modulator is indicative of GPR43 modulation by a candidate modulator. </p>[0198] ii. Downstream Pathway Activation Assays: </p>[0199] a. Calcium Flux\u2014The Aequorin-Based Assay. </p>[0200] The aequorin assay takes advantage ",
    "variant receptor or ligand and compare its activity to that of wild type GPR43. Among other benefits, this approach can provide novel mutants, including constitutively active and null mutants. </p>[0265] In addition to standard sequencing methods, amplified sequences can be assayed for the presence of specific mutations using, for example, hybridization of molecular beacons that discriminate between wild type and variant sequences. Hybridization assays that discriminate on the basis of changes as small as one nucleotide are well known in the art. Alternatively, any of a number of \u201cminisequencing\u201d assays can be performed, including, those described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,888,819, 6,004,744 and 6,013,431 (incorporated herein by reference). These assays and others known in the art can determine the presence, in a given sample, of a nucleic acid with a known polymorphism. </p>[0266] If desired, array or microarray-based methods can be used to analyze the expression or the presence of mutation, in GPR43 sequences. Array-based methods for minisequencing and for quantitation of nucleic acid expression are well known in the art. </p>[0267] C. Functional Assays. </p>[0268] Diagnosis of a disease or disorder characterized by the dysregulation of GPR43 signalling can also be performed using functional assays. To do so, cell membranes or cell extracts prepared from a tissue sample are used in an assay of GPR43 activity as described herein (e.g., ligand binding assays, the GTP-binding assay, GTPase assay, adenylate cyclase assay, cAMP assay, arachidonic acid level, phospholipid breakdown, diacyl glycerol or inositol triphosphate assays, PKC activation assay, or kinase assay). The activity detected is compared to that in a standard sample taken from a healthy individual or from an unaffected site on the affected individual. As an alternative, a sample or extract of a sample can be applied to cells expressing GPR43, followed by measurement of GPR43 signalling activity relative to a standard sample. A difference of 10% or more in the activity measured in any of these assays, relative to the activity of the standard, is diagnostic for a disease or disorder characterized by dysregulation of GPR43 signalling. </p>[0269] Modulation of GPR43 Activity in a Cell According to the Invention </p>[0270] The discovery of propionate as a ligand of GPR43 provides methods of modulating the activity of a GPR43 polypeptide in a cell. GPR43 activity is modulated in a cell by delivering to that cell an agent that modulates the function of a GPR43 polypeptide. This modulation can be performed in cultured cells as part of an assay for the identification of additional modulating agents, or, for example, in an animal, including a human. Agents include propionate and other SCFAs as defined herein, as well as additional modulators identified using the screening methods described herein including but not limited to any of the propionate analogues. </p>[0271] An agent can be de",
    "ometer and the fluorescence monitored (excitation and emission wavelengngths, 340 and 510 nm respectively). </p>[0372] Injection of propionate or acetate on PMN yields to an increase of intracellular calcium as compared to basal condition. FIG. 14 shows the kinetic plot of such an increase for varying concentration of Na propionate. The increase of intracellular calcium is monitored as an increase of the ratio \u201cbasal fluorescence\u201d over \u201cstimulated fluorescence\u201d. </p>[0373] Injection with increasing concentration of propionate (FIG. 15) or acetate (FIG. 16) leads to a concentration-dependent increase of intracellular calcium. Propionate and acetate are equipotent (EC<sub>50</sub>=540 \u03bcM and 537 \u03bcM, for propionate and acetate respectively). </p>[0374] The results show that propionate and acetate are able to induce the mobilization of intracellular calcium in human neutrophils. According to our previous results describing the complete pharmacological characterization of GPR43 as the cell surface target for short-chain fatty acids such as propionate and acetate, we conclude that the observed effect on calcium mobilization is mediated through the stimulation of the receptor of interest. Naccache et al (J Cell Physiol July 1988; 136(1):118-24), Fonteriz et al (Biochem Biophys Acta Jun. 7, 1991; 1093 (1): 1-6) and Nakao et al (Infect Immun December 1992; 60 (12):5307-11) have described that acetate and propionate stimulate the cytoplasmic calcium mobilization in PMN with millimolar EC50. But none of them associated the observed response with the simulation of a given G-protein coupled receptor,(GPCR), although experiments with pertussis toxin and activator/inhibitor of protein kinase C may have suggested a GPCR-mechanism. Brunkhorst et al (Infection and Immunity July 1992, vol 60, 7:2957-2968) has suggested a GPCR mechanism of action, for at least propionate and acetate, on a serie of PMN-activation event such as cytoskeletal F-actin alterations, PMN polarization, F-actin localization, cytoplasmic pH oscillation, cell shape. </p>[0375] We have showed that acetate and propionate were equipotent as activator of recombinant hGPR43 expressed in recombinant system. </p>[0376] We conclude therefore that our data firstly associate that the actions of acetate and propionate on the calcium-mobilization on human neutrophils are mediated through the activation of GPR43 solely. </p>Example 9 [0377] Chemotaxis Induced by SCFAs: Calcium and Chemotactic Assays on Neutrophils: </p>[0378] Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were purified from buffy coats of healthy volunteers as previously described (Struyf S, De Meester I, Scharpe S, Lenaerts J P, Menten P, Wang J M, Proost P, Van Damme J., Eur J Immunol Apr. 28, 1998; 28 (4):1262-71). For intracellular calcium measurements, the cells were loaded for 30 min at room temperature with Fura-2AM (Molecular Probes). Calcium transients were monitored by a LS50B spectrofluorimeter (Perkin Elmer) as described (Grynkiewicz G, Poe"
