A screening assay for the binding ability after a selection step based on the binding capacity can be done in order to estimate the enrichment of the library for meganuclease variants presenting a binding capacity.</p>The selection and screening assays are performed on the DNA region in which a double stranded cleavage has to be introduced or a fragment thereof. Preferably, the targeted sequences comprise at least 15 nucleotides, preferably 18 to 40, more preferably 18 to 30 nucleotides. In case of dimeric meganuclease, the targeted DNA polynucleotide can be reduced to at least 8 nucleotides for binding only. Preferably, the targeted DNA polynucleotide length is less than 10 kb, preferably less than 3 kb, more preferably less than 1 kb. For the DNA binding assay, the targeted DNA polynucleotide length is preferably less than 500 bp, more preferably less than 200 bp.</p>Any targeted sequence can be used to generate a custom-made meganuclease able to cleave it according. Optionally, the targeted sequence is chosen such as to present the most identity with the original recognition and cleavage site of the initial meganuclease.</p>Therefore, the DNA region in which a double stranded break has to be introduced is analyzed to choose at least 1, 2, 3 or 5 sequences of at least 15 nucleotides length, preferably 18 to 40 nucleotides, more preferably 18 to 30 nucleotides, having at least 25 % identity, preferably 50 % identity and more preferably 75 % identity with the original recognition and cleavage site of the initial meganuclease.</p>The targeted DNA sequence is adapted to the type of meganuclease variants library. If the library is based on a half site approach, the targeted DNA sequence used for the selection / screening comprises one half original site and one half site of the desired DNA sequence. If the library is based on a quarter site approach, the targeted DNA sequence used for the selection / screening comprises three quarters of the original site and one quarter site of the desired DNA sequence.</p>The meganuclease variants resulting from the selection and/or screening steps could optionally be an input for another cycle of diversity introduction.</p>The positive meganuclease variants selected by the selection and",
    "engineered that encodes the D75N mutant (Figure 2C : \u00ab Template \u00bb) fused to the phage coat protein p3 and phage-displayed D75N monomers were shown to bind the I-CreI natural DNA target (C1234 on Figure 9).</p>Then, DNA fragments carrying combinations of the desired mutations were obtained by PCR (several reactions in 50\u00b5l), using degenerated primers (Figure 2D : UlibIIfor, UlibIIrev) and as DNA template, the D75N gene. Lib2 was constructed by ligation of the corresponding PCR products, digested with specific restriction enzymes, into the D75N mutant gene, within the phagemid vector, as described in example 2.</p>Screening of meganucleases binding to the 6 different targetsScreening was performed by Phage ELISA, as described in example 2.</p>- Results4560 clones (more than 2.5 times the theoretical mutant library diversity) were individually picked and screened by phage ELISA with the 6 different targets. 28 positives (clones binding one of the six targets) were identified. For validation, these 28 clones were re-assayed by phage ELISA, 8 times in parallel with the 6 different targets; 20 clones were thus confirmed as true positives. Finally, all 28 clones were sequenced.\nTable 3: Sequence of the proteins found in the four different classes. Only amino acids from position 44, 68 and 70 are indicated. Clones found twice are labeled with (2).Class IClass IIClass IIIClass IVQ R K(NTQH)NQ R T (2)Unknown sequenceQ R RQ R N(RG) (ED)H (KEQ) EQ R AQ Q K (2)Q S RQ N KQ T R (2)Q Q RQ H KD S HUnknown sequence</p>Four different patterns (ELISA results) could be observed. Figure 10 features one representative example for each one. The first class (Class I) corresponds to a strong binding of C1234, C1221, C4334 and H4334. The wild-type protein (QRR) was recovered in this class, showing that Class I profile is the regular binding profile of the original scaffold. Two variants were also shown to display such binding (QRK and another yet not completely identified mutant).</p>Variants from the second class have lowered their affinity for all targets, but H4334, since no binding was observed with C1234, C1221 and C4334. Eight different proteins were found to belong to this class, plus a protein which sequence could not be determined. Among the sequence variants of Class II, five retain the Q44 amino acid from the wild-type sequence, and one of the two arginines in position 68 or 70. However, in one mutant (DSH), none of the amino acids from position 44, 68 and 70 has been retained. Class III (4 different proteins) has a more complex pattern, as it retains apparent binding for the C1221 and H4334 target. Finally, one protein (Class IV) retains only a slight binding for target C1221 as none of the other targets are bound anymore.</p>It is difficult to draw conclusions from Class IV, since the residual binding with C1221 is very low, and sequencing of the unique Class IV mutant has failed. However, comparison of Class II and III with the wild-type profile of Class I cl"
