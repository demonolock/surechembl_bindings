    "es. The HistoGel embedded organoid pellets were allowed to cool to room temperature, and then were stored in 70% ethanol at 4\u00b0C until the organoid pellets were ready for FFPE embedding by LJI Histology Core. Successive FFPE embedded organoid sections were cut at a 4 pm thickness and fixed on to microscope slides. </p>Immunohistochemistry </p>[00213] For SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (np) antigen retrieval, slides were immersed in Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 9.0) and boiled for 10 minutes at 100\u00b0C inside a pressure cooker. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation with 3% H2O2 for 10 minutes. To block non-specific protein binding, 2.5% goat serum was added. The slides were then incubated with a rabbit SARS-CoV-NP antibody (Sino Biological) for 1.5 hours at room temperature in a humidified chamber, then rinsed with TBS or PBS three times for 5 minutes each. Sections were also incubated with horse anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies for 30 minutes at room temperature, then washed with TBS or PBS three times for 5 minutes each. Then the sections were incubated with DAB and counterstained with hematoxylin for 30 seconds. </p>Permeability of lung monolayer using FITC-Dextran </p>[00214] Adult lung monolayers were grown for 2 days in PneumaCult Ex-Plus media on transwell inserts (6.5 mm diameter, 0.4 um pore size, Coming). Trans-Epithelial Electrical Resistance (TEER) was monitored with an Epithelial Volt-Ohm Meter (Millicell, USA). On the second day of growth, FITC-dextran (10 kD) was added at a 1-to- 50 dilution in lung wash media and the basolateral side of the insert was changed to lung \n\nwash media only. After 30 minutes of incubation with FITC-dextran, 50 m\u0390 of the basolateral supernatant was transferred to an opaque welled 96-well plate. Fluorescence was measured using a TECAN plate reader. </p>The characterization of lung cell types using Flow Cytometry [00215] Lung organoids were dissociated into single cells via trypLE digestion and strained with a 30 pm filter (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany). Approximately 2.5E5 cells for each sample were fixed and permeabilized at room temperature in Cyto-Fast Fix Perm buffer (BioLegend, USA) for 20 minutes. The samples were subsequently washed with Cyto-Fast Perm Wash solution (BioLegend, USA) and incubated with lung epithelial cell type markers for 30 minutes. Following primary antibody incubation, the samples were washed and incubated with Propidium Iodide (Invitrogen) and Alexa Flour 488 secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) for 30 minutes. Samples were then resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS, 5% FBS, 2 mM Sodium Azide). Flow cytometry was performed using Guava easyCyte benchtop flow cytometer (Millipore) and data was analyzed using InCyte (version 3.3) and FlowJo X vlO software. </p>RNA Sequencing </p>[00216] RNA sequencing libraries were generated using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold with TruSeq Unique Dual Indexes (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Samples were generally processed according "
