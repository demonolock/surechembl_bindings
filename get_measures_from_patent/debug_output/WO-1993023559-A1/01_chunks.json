    "ell growth factor receptor (EGF-R) interact with SH2/SH3-bearing intracellular molecules such as phospholipase C (PLC-7) , GTPase activating protein (GAP) and phosphoinositol \n\nkinase (PI-3 kinase) (Cantley et al., Cell 64:281-302, 1991) . Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-<sub>7</sub> acts to regulate its enzymatic activity (Heidecker et al. , Mol. Cell. Biol. 10:2503-2512, 1990; Kim et al. , Cell 65:436- 441, 1991).</p>In addition to tyrosine-mediated signaling, serine and threonine kinases such as protein kinase C (PKC) play important roles in growth regulation. Various isoforms of PKC are thought to phosphorylate substrates such as CD4 and p56<sup>lck</sup> in T cells (Acres et al., Biol. Chem.</p>261:16210-16214, 1989; Blue et al., J. Immunol. 139:3949- 3954, 1987; Hurley et al., Science 245:407-409, 1989; Rudd et al., Immunol. Rev. 111:225-266, 1989; and Rudd et al., \"Molecular analysis of the interaction of p56<sup>lck</sup> with the CD4 and CD8 antigens.\" In: Mechanisms of Lymphocyte Activation and Immune Regulation III. Gupta et al. (eds) , Plenum Press, New York, pp 85-89, 1991). Engagement of TcR/CD3 complex on T cells (Siegel et al. J. Biol. Chem. 265:18472-18480, 1990; Zmuidzinas et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 11:2794-2803, 1991), as well as stimulation by interleukin 2 (IL-2) (Turner et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 88:1227-1231, 1991), has been reported to stimulate Raf-1 kinase activity in these cells, an event which appears to require protein kinase C. The 70-72 Kd Raf-1 kinase is the cellular homologue of v-raf, the transforming gene of murine sarcoma virus 3611 (Rapp et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 80:4218- 4222, 1983). The amino terminal region of Raf-1 shares homology with protein kinase C (Stanton et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 9:639-647, 1989). V-Raf transforms murine 3T3 fibroblasts, and transfection with a c-Raf gene having a 5' deletion results in the induction of DNA synthesis in serum-starved fibroblast cells, indicating an important role for Raf in cell cycle progression (Heidecker et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 10:2503-2512, 1990; \n\nKolch et al.. Nature 349:426-428, 1991; Smith et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 10:3828-3833, 1990; Stanton et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 9:639-647, 1989; Tahira et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 15:4809-4820, 1987). In fibroblasts, PDGF binding results in a rapid Tyr/Ser phosphorylation of Raf, increased catalytic activity of Raf, and a physical association of Raf with the PDGF-R (Morrison et al. , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 85:8855-8859, 1989; Morrison et al. , Cell 58:649-657, 1989). This interaction, which is mediated by unknown residues within Raf, provides a potential link between the tyrosine kinase and serine/threonine kinase signalling pathways in fibroblasts (Li et al. , Cell 64:479-482, 1991; Morrison et al.. Cell 58:649-657, 1989). Unlike other receptors in T cells, Raf-1 does not associate physically with the</p>TcR/CD3 complex (Siegel et al., J. Biol. Chem. 265:18472- 18480, 1990) .</p>Summary of the Invention The CD4 and CD8 antigens on T cells have been previously shown to associate with the src family member p56 <sup>k</sup> and a novel GTP-binding, 32 Kd protein termed p32. The identification of receptor interactions with intracellular mediators is essential to the elucidation of downstream signals mediated by engagement of these receptor complexes. It has now been found that a previously undetected llOKd polypeptide, herein termed \"pllO\", is associated with the CD4:p56<sup>lc</sup> complex in human peripheral blood T lymphocytes and certain leukemic T cell lines. As described in detail in the experimental section below, pllO is recognized directly by an antiserum to the C-terminal region of the 70-72 Kd serine/threonine kinase Raf-1, and appears identical to a 110 Kd protein detected in anti-Raf-1 immunoprecipitates formed using the same antiserum. Despite its association \n\nwith CD4:p56<sup>lck</sup> complex, pllO was found to be phosphorylated predominantly on serine residues. Furthermore, phorbal ester treatment of cells resulted in a transient increase in the detection of pllO associated with CD4:p56<sup>lc</sup> , concomitant with the modulation of</p>CD4:p56<sup>lck</sup> from the cell surface. This Raf-1-related pllO is therefore likely to play a role in signals generated from the CD4:p56<sup>lck</sup> complex.</p>The invention features methods for screening candidate compounds to identify compounds capable of inhibiting the naturally occurring association of pllO and the CD4:p56<sup>lck</sup> T cell receptor complex. One such method involves the steps of:</p>(a) providing a first and a second sample of cells expressing both pllO and the CD4:p56<sup>lck</sup> T cell receptor complex;</p>(b) incubating the first sample in the presence of a candidate compound;</p>(c) incubating the second sample in the absence of the candidate compound;</p>(d) generating a first immunoprecipitate by adding to the first sample a first aliquot of an antibody capable of specifically binding pllO (i.e., which forms an immune complex directly with pllO) : for example, an anti-raf-1 antibody or antiserum, or an antibody raised against pllO or an immunogenic fragment thereof;</p>(e) generating a second immunoprecipitate by adding to the second sample a se",
    "en-antibody complex from the remainder of the biological sample. Alternatively, the method can be carried out on a sample which contains both pllO and CD4:p56<sup>lck</sup>, using an antibody which binds to a component of the CD4rp56<sup>lc</sup> complex.</p>Also within the invention are an isolated DNA encoding pllO, a plasmid containing such a DNA (which plasmid may also contain an expression control sequence capable of directing expression of pllO from the DNA encoding pllO) , and a cell containing the isolated DNA. The pllO so encoded may correspond to human, mouse, rat, pig, cow, or any other animal's pllO which can be detected by the methods disclosed herein. By \"isolated DNA encoding pllO\" is meant a DNA sequence that is free of the genes which, in the naturally-occurring genome of the organism from which the isolated DNA of the invention is derived, flank the pllO gene. The term therefore includes, for example, a recombinant DNA which is incorporated into a vector, into an autonomously replicating plasmid or virus, or into the genomic DNA of a prokaryote or eukaryote, or which exists as a separate molecule (e.g., a cDNA, a synthetic DNA, or a genomic DNA fragment produced by PCR or restriction endonuclease treatment) independent of other DNA sequences. It also includes a recombinant DNA which is part of a hybrid gene encoding additional polypeptide sequence.</p>Substantially purified pllO, or antigenic fragments thereof which are not identical to any portion of 70-72 Kd Raf-1, may be used to immunize an animal and thereby generate an antibody (polyclonal or monoclonal) which binds preferentially to pllO compared to 70-72 Kd Raf-1: i.e., the antibody binds to the latter protein, if at all, with an affinity substantially less than the affinity with which it binds pllO. Such an antibody would be useful in methods for purifying pllO; for \n\ninterfering with the association of pllO and the CD4:p56<sup>lck</sup> complex in T cells by contacting such cells with the antibody; for determining the amount of pllO in a sample by contacting the sample with the antibody and determining the amount of antigen-antibody complex formation in the sample; and for determining the level of pllO kinase activity in a sample by contacting the sample with the antibody to form an immunoprecipitate, and determining the level of serine/threonine kinase activity in that immunoprecipitate. Either of the latter two methods could be employed as a diagnostic technique for certain conditions characterized by abnormal signal transduction via the CD4:p56 :pll0 pathway (e.g., a cancerous or precancerous condition, an autoimmune disease, or a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection) . In such a case, the biological sample would include T cells obtained from an animal (e.g., a human) suspected of having such a condition, and the amount of pllO or the level of pllO kinase activity in the sample would be compared to the amount or level in a normal sample, with an abnormal amount or level being an indication that the animal has the condition.</p>Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following deta",
    "elf are available, pllO and fragments or analogs thereof may be analyzed for their ability to interfere with infection and/or activation of T cells. The active site and/or ligand binding site(s) on pllO can be determined by methods analogous to those utilized by Veillette et al. (Eur. J. Immunol. 20:1397-1400, 1990), Turner et al. (Cell 60:755-765, 1990), Shaw et al. (Mol. Cell. Biol. 10:1853-1862, 1990) and Glaichenhaus et al. (Cell 64:511- 520, 1991); analogs of pllO may then be produced which are deficient in either or both functions. Inhibitors of the activity of pllO can be utilized to reduce the susceptibility of T cells to viral infection via the CD4 antigen, or to reduce the susceptibility of a human to cancer formation or the development of autoimmune disease. Such inhibitors may act directly on pllO, or on CD4, p56<sup>lck</sup>, or a kinase or phosphatase which acts on any of the three. \n\nCloning and expression of pllO cDNA</p>A cDNA encoding the pllO polypeptide may be obtained as follows:</p>HPB-ALL cells stimulated with PMA are used to prepare a cDNA library by standard methods. The library is screened at low stringency with a hybridization probe prepared from c-Raf cDNA (Bonner et al.. Nucleic Acids Res. 14:1009, 1986). Positive clones are then expressed in an expression system such as COS cells cotransfected with CD4 cDNA and p56<sup>lck</sup> cDNA, and anti-CD4- immunoprecipitates prepared as described below are analyzed on SDS-PAGE for the presence of a 110 Kd phosphoprotein. Verification that a given clone is pllO cDNA can be accomplished by, for example, a competition assay in which a CD4:p56<sup>lck</sup>:pllO complex containing labelled pllO is exposed to excess unlabelled putative recombinant pllO. Alternatively, a cDNA may be obtained by screening a cDNA library with a degenerate hybridization probe based upon a partial amino acid sequence of purified pllO, which may be obtained from SDS-PAGE fractionation of anti-raf or anti-CD4 immunoprecipitates, prepared as described in the experimental section below.</p>The cDNA encoding pllO may then be incorporated into an expression system such as the pGex-2T expression system (Smith et al.. Gene 67:31, 1988) or a baculo expression system using the vector Xpress System vector (Invitrogen Corp, CA) in SF9 cells, in order to produce relatively large quantities of recombinant pllO polypeptide. After purification of the recombinant protein by standard methods using, for example, heparin and DEAE chromatography, or an affinity column (e.g., an anti-Raf affinity column) , the purified polypeptide may be incorporated into an in vitro assay to screen for potential agonists and antagonists of pllO. \n\nAlternatively, the recombinant pllO may be proteolytically digested (e.g., with trypsin) or treated with CNBr to form discrete fragments that can then be purified (by, for example, high performance liquid chromatography [HPLC]) and assayed for their ability to inhibit the interaction of pllO an",

In some experiments, a specific protein band was excised from the polyacrylamide gel and the protein extracted in NH<sub>4</sub>HC0<sub>3</sub> (50 mM) , SDS (0.1% wt/vol) , &gt;3-mercaptoethanol (0.1% vol/vol), BSA (0.1%). The extract was lyophilized, resuspended in a 10 fold dilution of lysis buffer, and subjected to immunoprecipitation.</p>Phosphoamino acid analysis and phosphotryptic peptide mapping The extracted protein was subjected to acid hydrolysis (6 M HCl) and the phosphoamino acids were separated by two dimensional thin layer electrophoresis according to the procedure of Cooper et. al. (Meth. Enzy. 99:387-405, 1983). For two-dimensional tryptic peptide \n\nmapping, eluted proteins were exhaustively digested with TPCK-trypsin, and the resulting peptides were separated on a 0.1 mm thick cellulose plate (E. Merck, Germany) by electrophoresis (pH 8.9, 1000 volts for 30 min), and then by ascending chromatography (butanol, pyridine, acetic acid, water: 75, 50, 15, 60) (Hunter et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 77:1311-1315, 1980; Pallas et al.. Cell 30:407-414, 1982).</p>RESULTS To ascertain whether the CD4:p56<sup>lck</sup> complex is associated with any intracellular proteins, immunoprecipitates formed from peripheral blood lymphocytes and a variety of T lymphoblastoid cells (HPB- ALL, REX and MOLT 15) by anti-CD4 antibody 19Thy5D7 were analyzed by phosphotransferase labelling. As seen in Fig. 1, a 110 Kd protein (referred to herein as pllO protein) was often co-precipitated with the CD4:p56<sup>lck</sup> complexes. Under the same labelling conditions, pllO was not detected in negative controls which included rabbit anti-mouse (lanes l, 6, 9, 12, 16), anti-CD3 (lane 4) and anti-fyn (lane 18) . In order to establish the identity of the pllO protein, immunoprecipitates were compared to precipitates formed by antiserum to the Raf-1 kinase. Previous studies have reported that in fibroblasts, a 110 Kd subunit is associated with anti-Raf immunoprecipitates, but is not itself bound by anti-Raf antibody. This 110 Kd subunit is the primary target of kinase labelling in these fibroblast anti-Raf immunoprecipitates (Siegel et al., J. Biol. Chem. 265:18472-18480, 1990; Zmuidzinas et al., Mol. Cell.</p>Biol. 11:2794-2803, 1991). In the present study using T cell-related cell lines, anti-Raf-1 immunoprecipitates revealed the presence of a 110 Kd band from all the cell lines examined (Fig. 1, lanes 5, 8, 11, 15, 19). Little \n\nif any of the p72 Raf-1 kinase was observed in these cells. This anti-Raf-1-precipitated pllO co-migrated with the pllO associated with CD4:p56<sup>lck</sup>, raising the possibility that the two are identical. Alkali treatment of gels resulted in the complete loss of the radiolabel from the pllO bands, suggesting phosphorylation on Ser and Thr residues. Due to some variability in the detection of pllO from experiment to experiment and also due to the fact that pllO is phoshorylated mainly on Ser/Thr, the effects of stimulating HPB-ALL cells with phorbol ester (PMA, 100 ng/ml) prior to analysis were investigated. PMA activates serine/threonine kinases, including protein kinase C (Nishizuka, Nature 334:661-665, 1988). As shown in Fig. 2B, exposure of cells to PMA resulted in a time- dependent decrease in the density of CD4 on the surface of cells as detected by flow cytometry. Consistent with this loss was an observed time-dependent shift in the Mr of CD4-associated p56<sup>lck</sup> from 56 Kd to 60 Kd, as well as a decrease in the overall intensity of labelled p56<sup>lc</sup> (Fig. 2A) . This has been previously noted (Rudd et al. , Immunol. Rev. 111:225-266, 1989; Rudd et al. , \"Molecular analysis of the interaction of p56<sup>lck</sup> with the CD4 and CD8 antigens.\" In: Mechanisms of Lymphocyte Activation and Immune Regulation III. Gupta et al. (eds) , Plenum Press, New York, pp 85-89, 1991; Hurley et al.. Science 245:407- 409, 1989). However, despite the reduction in detectable CD4 and p56<sup>lc</sup> , the appearance of CD4-associated pllO increased markedly in PMA-treated T cells (Fig. 2A, t=0-60'). Similarly, there was an increase in the intensity of pllO phosphorylation in anti-Raf immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2A, 0-60'). As observed in untreated samples, p72 Raf-1 was not visualized under this labelling regime. 24 h treatment with PMA resulted in the complete loss of CD4 from the cell surface (Fig. \n\n2B) , and pllO could not be detected in the CD4 immunoprecipitate (Fig. 2A, 24 h) . In subsequent experiments, cells were routinely treated with PMA prior to experimental analysis. Two-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that the phosphorylated amino acid residues on pllO associated with CD4:p56<sup>lck</sup> (Fig. 3, panel B) were predominantly serine residues. Only prolonged autoradiographic exposures allowed for the detection of small amounts of phosphorylation on tyrosine residues. Similarly, pllO derived from anti-Raf immunoprecipitates was found to "
