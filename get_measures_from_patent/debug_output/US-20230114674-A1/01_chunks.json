    "ck solution with DMSO (Sigma, Cat #276855-1L) and the stock solution was further diluted with DMSO to 20 \u03bcM and 20 nM working solutions. Drug treatment of MM.1S cells started at a concentration of up to 100 nM and the drug was serial diluted 4-fold with 10 points, with three replicate wells. Nanoliter volumes of compound solutions were added to the corresponding wells of the 384-well plate according to the needed concentration in a non-contact spraying manner by an HPD300 microscale automated dispenser (Tecan). The final concentration of DMSO was 0.5%. After drug addition, the 384-well plate was cultured in a 37\u00b0 C., 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator for 120 hours. After five days of drug treatment, 25 \u03bcl of CTG reagent (Promega, Cat #G7573) was added to each well, and the plate was shaken on a plate shaker for 10 minutes to ensure that the cells were fully lysed, and then left to stand at room temperature for 10 minutes to ensure a sufficient reaction of CTG with the substrate and the generation of a stable luminescent signal. The signal is proportional to the amount of ATP in the cell lysate, i.e., the number of metabolically active cells. Chemiluminescence of the cells in the plate was detected by an EnSpire instrument. The reading of the cells at Day 0 was used as a control for cells at growth starting point and the reading of cells with 0.5% DMSO at Day 5 was used as a control for cells under growth. Cell proliferation inhibition curve was plotted using XLFit software and the IC50 value was calculated. Experiment results can be seen in Table 2.</p>TABLE 2MM.1S cell proliferation inhibition resultsCompoundsMM.2S IC<sub>50 </sub>(nM)Control 1119.0859CM-450.0938CM-460.0687CM-470.1351CM-480.0365CM-490.0606</p>"
