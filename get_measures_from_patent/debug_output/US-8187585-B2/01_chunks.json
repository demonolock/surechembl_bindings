    "considerably lower than that of Matrix-Q.</p>Matrix-QWT is produced from another purified fraction of Quillaja saponin (Fraction-A). The adjuvant effect is described as lower that for Matrix-C (PCT/SE2004/001038) but it appears to be strong for cellular immune responses. Matrix-QWT appears to be essentially non-toxic in doses relevant for adjuvant activity and is very well tolerated in all animal species tested.</p>Matrix-MIX\u2014is a mixture of Matrix-QWT and Matrix-C (consisting of 17% Matrix-C and 83% Matrix-QWT). Similar mixtures were shown to exert surprisingly high adjuvant effect for single antigens (WO 2004/004762, PCT/SE2004/001038).</p>All matrix adjuvant formulations were from Isconova AB, Uppsala, Sweden.</p>Antigens</p>Formalin treated Tetanus toxoid (TT) was from The State Serum Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark. TT is a considerably immunogenic antigen. A higher dose (2.5 lf) and a low dose (0.5 Lf) were used in the examples. For this particular batch, 1 Lf of toxoid corresponds to x micrograms of protein.</p>Recombinant Diptheria toxoid (DT) was from Sigma. A dose of 1 microgram was used in the examples.</p>Fibronectin binding protein (FnBp) was manufactured by Crosslink Ltd Budapest Hungary and was a mixture of FnBp A Short (396 bp with 100% conformity of FnBp A of NC<sub>\u2014</sub>002951.2) and FnBp B Short (396 bp with 95% conformity of FnBp B of NC<sub>\u2014</sub>002951.2 and from Biostapro AB Ulltunaallen 2B 756 51 Uppsala, Sweden and was a DNA fragment including a 16 kD fibronectin binding domain including 3 DD repeats including a cystein N terminal not essential for the immunization result. 190 \u03bcg of this construct was mixed with 1 mg iscom matrix per dose.</p>ELISA</p>Mouse sera. Antigen specific antibodies in serum were measured in individual samples by conventional indirect ELISA. Microtiter plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated over night at +4\u00b0 C. with the individual antigens at a concentration of 1 \u03bcg/ml in 50 mM carbonate buffer pH 9.6. Prior to incubation with samples, the plates were blocked for 1 hour at r.t. with PBS-T (Phosphate Buffered Saline with 0.05% Tween) supplemented with 2% (w/v) fat free milk powder (PBS-T/M). The plates were incubated sequentially with serial dilutions of test sera in PBS-T/M and HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Dakocytomation, Denmark). For measurement of IgG subclasses, serial dilutions of test sera were incubated with HRP-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG1HRP (Serotec, Norway) or with HRP-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG2a HRP (Serotec, Norway). The enzyme reaction was visualised by incubation with substrate buffer (K-blue, SVANOVA, Uppsala, Sweden), the reaction was stopped after 10 minutes by addition of 50 \u03bcl 2 M H2SO4 and the absorbance was read at 450 nm. All washings were done with PBS-T. Conjugates were diluted according to the manufacturers instructions in PBS-T/M. Titres were calculated by interpolation of the linear part of the titration curve and are expressed as reciprocals of",
    "e failure were a short-lived immunity and probably also insufficient immune responses in the mammary gland.</p>The aim of this vaccination experiment was to explore the possibilities to further develop the FnBp vaccine adjuvanted with a formulation based on the iscom technology. A focus was on an optimal mode of administration to evoke immune responses both systemically, measured in blood serum and locally in the mammary gland. Thus, to obtain a better forecast for the potential of the vaccine candidate immunological analyses were also carried out on the local secretion (milk whey) from the udder. The evaluation of the immune responses included the antibody responses in serum and milk whey including IgG1, IgG2 and IgA and also looks into the enhancement by antibodies of the phagocytosis of SA cells. IgG2 is promoting phagocytosis, which is the most important defense mechanism against SA. The locally produced IgA antibodies are also important defense factor against invaders in mucosal surfaces. It should be noted that the previous experiments have not analysed the immune responses in the mammary gland most likely because previous vaccine did not induce clearly detectable immune responses in the milk whey that convincingly would support the trial. It has been conceived that the dilution of high volumes of milk would hide the immune response evoked in the mammary gland.</p>The Lay Out of the Vaccine Trial and Materials and Methods</p>The fibronectin binding protein (FnBp) of 16 kD fragment of larger a protein to include the DD region responsible for adhesion to fibronectin. The polypetide was expressed in E. coli and obtained from Biostapro AB. It differed from the previous product (Nelson et al. 1991) that was based on shorter 69 to 80 kD protein. Furthermore, in the previous product the FnBp was incorporated into the iscom matrix to form an iscom. In the present experimental vaccine the preparation of the vaccine did not encompass a step to include the FnBp in a matrix to form an iscom. Avoiding the incorporation gives the advantage of a simpler and more economical production system. Thus, the present formulation differs from two aspects from the previous tested FnBp iscom vaccine candidate.</p>The iscom matrix was supplied by Isconova AB.</p>The bacteriological examinations of milk samples were done at the mastitis laboratory at the National Veterinary Institute (SVA).</p>Experimental Performance</p>The antigen FnBp a rDNA product produced in E. coli was selected because of previous positive experience (Nelson et al-), but the construct was shorter. The immunological evaluation is optimally facilitated with a defined antigen.</p>Ten heifers going into their first lactation were used as experimental animals to avoid as far as possible previous experience with SA infections, more likely in older cows, which would cause difficulties for the immunological evaluation of the vaccination.</p>Three different modes of administration were tested. Since the udder is an organ with a large mucosal area it was considered that mucosal immunity in the mammary gland is important. In contrast to, e.g. man and swine, there is no gut mammary link in the bovines (personal communication Holmberg), i.e. oral administration of v",
    "ction since this subclass promotes phagocytosis of the bacteria. All modes of immunisation promoted IgG2 and IgA FnBp specific antibodies both in milk whey and in blood serum. The antibody responses were considerably lower in serum and milk whey from animals that were primed i. vag and i.n. Unexpectedly high antibody levels were induced by two s.c. immunizations both in serum and mammary gland secretion with FnBp adjuvanted with iscom matrix including IgG1, IgG2 and the IgA subclasses Immune responses of these magnitudes and quality have not been shown before in the bovine mammary gland with SA vaccines or any other vaccine. Also in blood serum these Ig subclasses were recorded. The s.c. mode of administration induced a long-lasting and superior immune response than the previously tested experimental vaccine (FIG. 4:4), which was of short duration (Nelson et al. 1991). Of particular interest and value is the potent immune response in the mammary gland, which is not described with previous tested vaccine candidates against SA. The result from the functional phagocytosis test underlines that the important immune protective properties are evoked. The potent immuno enhancing effect of iscom matrix was not expected and facilitates an efficient vaccine production by avoiding the step of conjugation the FnBp polypeptides to iscom matrix.</p>There are two fibronectin binding protein FnBpA and FnBpB that are similarly organized. The construct used by Nelson et al consisted of a 60-65 kD protein conjugated with two IgG binding domains from the Staphylococcal protein A to form the fusion protein zzFnBpA to another part containing the presumptive T-cell epitopes to form zz-FnBpA-T and a zz-FnBpB, which contains a presumptive T-cell epitope. These polypeptides were conjugated to iscoms (L\u00f6vgren, K., Lindmark, J., Pipkorn, R. and Morein, B (1987) J. Immunol. Methods 98. We have used these polypeptides and found that they fragmented. One reason for the limitation of the Nelson construct we considered to be caused by the tendency to this fragmentation. The present fragment of FnBp of 16 kD is more stable and contains the repeats of the important DD region that facilitates the binding to fibronectin.</p>Conclusion</p>A truncated FnBp construct supplemented with an iscom matrix formulation induces after two s.c. immunizations high levels of high quality immune responses in the mammary gland and serum. There are strong immunological criteria that the prospective vaccine shall induce immune protection against SA infection in the bovine mammary gland. The technology enables an efficient production system that is of importance for a prospective vaccine.</p>Example 6The effect on the whole SA-cell and the \u03b1 and \u03b2 haemolysins on the immune responses to FnBp and the toxins</p>SA causes chronic and persistent infections, which is facilitated by intrinsic properties of the pathogen based on ability to \u201chide\u201d essential components for infection and survival for the immune system of the host. Moreover, pathogens causing persistent and chronic infections have capacity to guide the immune reactions of the host to allow its persistence. SA harbour a number of different components of immune regulatory properties and a wrong composition may cause low immune responses to one or all antigens included in the vaccine composition. As described above there are many components that are candidates for a SA vaccine. The first strategy is to use components that are isolated form the pathogen or produced as isolates vaccine antigens expressed by a cell in this case E. coli. The second ap"
