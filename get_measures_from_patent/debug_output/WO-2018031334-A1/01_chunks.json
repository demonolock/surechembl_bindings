One of ordinary skill in the art recognizes that the specific synthetic ste",
    "s in 4-20% Tris-Glycine SDS-PAGE. The enzyme is stored at -80 \u00b0C in small aliquots. </p>BACE1 FRET Assay </p> Serial dilutions of the test compound are prepared as described above. The compound is further diluted 20x in KH2PO4 buffer. Each dilution (10 \\L) is added to each well on row A to H of a corresponding low protein binding black plate containing the reaction mixture (25 yL of 50 mM KH2PO4, pH 4.6, 1 mM TRITON\u00ae X-100, 1 mg/mL BSA, and 15 \u03bc\u039c of FRET substrate based upon the sequence of APP) (See Yang, et. al , J. Neurochemistry, 91(6) 1249-59 (2004)). The content is mixed well on a plate shaker for 10 minutes. Human BACEl(l-460):Fc (15 yL of 200 pM) (See Vasser, et al., Science, 286, 735-741 (1999)) in the KH<sub>2</sub>P0<sub>4</sub> buffer is added to the plate containing substrate and the test compound to initiate the reaction. The RFU of the mixture at time 0 \n\n is recorded at excitation wavelength 355 nm and emission wavelength 460 nm, after brief mixing on a plate shaker. The reaction plate is covered with aluminum foil and kept in a dark humidified oven at room temperature for 16 to 24 hours. The RFU at the end of incubation is recorded with the same excitation and emission settings used at time 0. The difference of the RFU at time 0 and the end of incubation is representative of the activity of BACE1 under the compound treatment. RFU differences are plotted versus inhibitor concentration and a curve is fitted with a four-parameter logistic equation to obtain the IC50 value. (May, et al., Journal ofNeuroscience, 3J_, 16507-16516 (2011)). </p> The compound of Example 1 is tested essentially as described above and exhibits an IC50 for BACE1 of 0.263 nM + 0.035, n=5 (Mean + standard deviation of the mean). This data demonstrates that the compound of Example 1 inhibits purified recombinant BACE1 enzyme activity in vitro. \n\n</p>SH-SY5YAPP695Wt Whole Cell Assay </p> The routine whole cell assay for the measurement of inhibition of BACE1 activity utilizes the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y (ATCC Accession No. CRL2266) stably expressing a human APP695Wt cDNA. Cells are routinely used up to passage number 6 and then discarded. </p> SH-SY5YAPP695Wt cells are plated in 96 well tissue culture plates at 5.0xl0<sup>4</sup> cells/well in 200 \u03bc\u0390, culture media (50% MEM/EBSS and Ham's F12, lx each sodium pyruvate, non-essential amino acids and NaHCC containing 10% FBS). The following day, media is removed from the cells, fresh media added then incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 24 hours in the presence/absence of test compound at the desired concentration range. </p> At the end of the incubation, conditioned media are analyzed for evidence of beta- secretase activity by analysis of Abeta peptides 1-40 and 1-42 by specific sandwich ELISAs. To measure these specific isoforms of Abeta, monoclonal 2G3 is used as a capture antibody for Abeta 1-40 and monoclonal 21F12 as a capture antibody for Abeta 1-42. Both Abeta 1-40 and Abeta 1-42 ELISAs use biotinylated 3D6 as the reporting antibody (for description of antibodies, see Johnson-Wood, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94, 1550-1555 (1997)). The concentration of Abeta released in the conditioned media following the compound treatment corresponds to the activity of BACE1 under such conditions. The 10-point inhibition curve is plotted and fitted with the four- parameter logistic equation to obtain the IC50 values for the Abeta- lowering effect. </p> The compound of Example 1 is tested essentially as described above and exhibits an IC50 of 0.0260 nM + 0.0104, n=6 for SH-SY5YAPP695Wt A-beta (1-40) ELISA and an IC50 of 0.0313 nM + 0.0187, n=6 for SH-SY5YAPP695Wt A-beta (1-42) ELISA (Mean + standard deviation of the mean). The data set forth above demonstrates that the compound of Example 1 inhibits BACE1 in the whole cell assay. \n</p>"
