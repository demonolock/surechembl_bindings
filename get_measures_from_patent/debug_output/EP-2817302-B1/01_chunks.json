    " hyperphosphorylation (Cedazo-Minguez et al., Journal of Neurochemistry, 2003, 87, 1152-1164). Among other aspect of Alzheimer's disease, it was also reported the relevance of activation of GSK-3\u03b2 at molecular level (Hernandez and Avila, FEBS Letters, 2008, 582, 3848-3854).</p>Moreover, it was demonstrated that GSK-3\u03b2 is involved in the genesis and maintenance of neurodegenerative changes associated with Parkinson's disease (Duka T. et al., The FASEB Journal, 2009; 23, 2820-2830).</p>Accordingly to these experimental observations, inhibitors of GSK-3\u03b2 may find applications in the treatment of the neuropathological consequences and the cognitive and attention deficits associated with tauopathies; Alzheimer's disease; Parkinson's disease; Huntington's disease (the involvement of GSK-3\u03b2 in such deficits and diseases is disclosed in Meijer L. et al., TRENDS Pharm Sci, 2004; 25, 471-480); dementia, such as, but not limited to, vascular dementia, post-traumatic dementia, dementia caused by meningitis and the like; acute stroke; traumatic injuries; cerebrovascular accidents; brain and spinal cord trauma; peripheral neuropathies; retinopathies and glaucoma (the involvement of GSK-3\u03b2 in such conditions is disclosed in WO 2010/109005</patcit>).</p>The treatment of spinal neurodegenerative disorders, like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy and neurodegeneration due to spinal cord injury has been also suggested in several studies related to GSK-3\u03b2 inhibition, such as, for example in Calder\u00f3 J. et al., \"Lithium prevents excitotoxic cell death of motoneurons in organotypic slice cultures of spinal cord\", Neuroscience. 2010 Feb 17;165(4):1353-69, L\u00e9ger B. et al., \"Atrogin-1, MuRF1, and FoXO, as well as phosphorylated GSK-3beta and 4E-BP1 are reduced in skeletal muscle of chronic spinal cord-injured patients\", Muscle Nerve, 2009 Jul; 40(1):69-78, and Galimberti D. et al., \"GSK3\u03b2 genetic variability in patients with Multiple Sclerosis\", Neurosci Lett. 2011 Jun 15;497(1):46-8.Furthermore, GSK-3\u03b2 has been linked to the mood disorders, such as bipolar disorders, depression, and schizophrenia.</p>Inhibition of GSK-3\u03b2 may be an important therapeutic target of mood stabilizers, and regulation of GSK-3\u03b2 may be involved in the therapeutic effects of other drugs used in psychiatry. Dysregulated GSK-3\u03b2 in mood disorder, bipolar disorder, depression and schizophrenia could have multiple effects that could impair neural plasticity, such as modulation of neuronal architecture, neurogenesis, gene expression and the ability of neurons to respond to stressful, potentially lethal conditions (Jope and Roh, Curr. Drug Targets, 2006, 7, 1421-1434).</p>The role of GSK-3\u03b2 in mood disorder was highlighted by the study of lithium and valproate (Chen et al., J. Neurochem., 1999, 72, 1327-1330; Klein and Melton, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1996, 93, 8455-8459), both of which are GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitors and are used to treat mood disorders. There are also existing reports from the genetic perspective supporting the role of GSK-3\u03b2 in the disease physiology of bipolar disorder (Gould, Expert. Opin. Ther. Targets, 2006, 10, 377-392).</p>It was reported a decrease in AKT1 protein levels and its phosphorylation of GSK-3\u03b2 at Serine-9 in the peripheral lymphocytes and brains of individuals with schizophrenia. Accordingly, this finding supports the proposal that alterations in AKT1-GSK-3\u03b2 signaling contribute to schizophrenia pathogenesis (Emamian et al., Nat Genet, 2004, 36, 131-137).</p>Additionally, the role of GSK-3\u03b2 in cancer is a well-accepted phenomenon.</p>The potential of small molecules that inhibit GSK-3\u03b2 has been evidenced for some specific cancer treatments (Jia Luo, Cancer Letters, 2009, 273, 194-200). GSK-3\u03b2 expression and activation are associated with prostate cancer progression (Rinnab et al., Neoplasia, 2008, 10, 624-633) and the inhibition of GSK3b was also proposed as specific target for pancreatic cancer (Garcea et al., Current Cancer Drug Targets, 2007, 7, 209-215) and ovarian cancer (Qi Cao et al., Cell Research, 2006, 16 671-677). Acute inhibition of GSK-3\u03b2 in colon-rectal cancer cells activates p53-dependent apoptosis and antagonizes tumor growth (Ghosh et al., Clin Cancer Res 2005, 11, 4580-4588).</p>The identification of a functional role for GSK-3\u03b2 in MLL-associated leukaemia suggests that GSK-3\u03b2 inhibition may be a promising therapy that is selective for transformed cells that are dependent on HOX overexpression (Birch et al., Cancer Cell, 2010, 17, 529-531).</p>GSK-3\u03b2 is involved in numerous inflammatory signalling pathways, for example, among others GSK-3\u03b2 inhibition has been shown to induce secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. According to this finding, GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitors could be useful to regulate suppression of inflammation (G. Klamer et al., Current Medicinal Chemistry, 2010, 17(26), 2873-2281, Wang et al., Cytokine, 2010, 53, 130-140).</p>GSK-3\u03b2 inhibition has been also shown to attenuate cocaine-induced behaviors in mice. The administration of cocaine in mice pretreated with a GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitor demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of GSK3 reduced both the acute behavioral responses to cocaine and the long-term neuroadaptations produced by repeated cocaine (Cocaine-induced hyperactivity and sensitization are dependent on GSK3, Miller JS et al. Neuropharmacology. 2009 Jun; 56(8):1116-23, Epub 2009 Mar 27).</p>The role of GSK-3\u03b2 in the development of several forms of epilepsies has been demonstrated in several studies, which suggest that inhibition of GSK-3\u03b2 could be a pathway for the treatment of epilepsy (Novel glycogen synthase kinase 3 and ubiquitination pathways in progressive myoclonus epilepsy, Lohi H et al., Hum Mol Genet. 2005 Sep 15;14(18):2727-36 and Hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of Tau in laforin-deficient mice, an animal model for Lafora disease, Puri R et al., J Biol Chem. 2009 Aug 21;284(34):22657-63).</p>The relationship between GSK-3\u03b2 inhibition and treatment of neuropathic pain has been demonstrated in Mazzardo-Martins L. et al., \"Glycogen synthase kinase 3-specific inhibitor AR-A014418 decreases neuropathic pain in mice: evidence for the mechanisms of action\", Neuroscience. 2012 Dec 13;226, and Xiaoping Gu et al., \"The Role of Akt/GSK3\u03b2 Signaling Pathway in Neuropathic Pain in Mice\", Poster A525, Anesthesiology 2012 October 13-17, 2012 Washington.</p>A review on GSK-3\u03b2, its function, its therapeutic potential and its possible inhibitors is given in \"GSK-3\u03b2: role in therapeutic landscape and development of modulators\" (S. Phukan et al., British Journal of Pharmacology (2010), 160, 1-19).</p>WO 2004/014864</patcit> discloses 1 H-indazole-3-carboxamide compounds as selective cyclin-dependant kinases (CDK) inhibitors. Such compounds are assumed to be useful in the treatment of cancer, through a mechanism mediated by CDK<sub>2</sub>, and neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Alzheimer's disease, through a mechanism mediated by CDK<sub>5</sub>, and as anti-viral and anti-fungine, through a mechanism mediated by CDK<sub>7</sub>, CDK<sub>8</sub> and CDK<sub>9</sub>.</p>Cyclin-dependant kinases (CDKs) are serine/threonine kinases, first discovered for their role in regulating the cell cycle. CDKs are also involved in regulating transcription, mRNA processing, and the differentiation of nerve cells. Such kinases activate only after their interaction and binding with regulatory subunits, namely cyclins.</p>More",

Biol., 2003-10:1255-1266).</p>In a first screening assay, compounds were tested in duplicate at a concentration of 10 \u00b5M.</p>Human recombinant enzyme GSK-3\u03b2 was incubated for 90 minutes at 22\u00b0C in the presence of compounds or vehicle in a reaction buffer containing ATP plus 100 nM unphosphorylated specific substrate peptide (Ulight-CFFKNIVTPRTPPPSQGK-amide). Substrate phosphorylation was measured by LANCE technology (PerkinElmer, CT, USA).</p>The results, reported in the following Table 4, are expressed as a percentage of inhibition of control specific activity obtained in the presence of the test compounds (as % inhibition at 10 \u00b5M).</p>In a second assay, the same compounds were assayed at five concentrations ranging from 100 \u00b5M to 10 nM with ten-fold dilutions in duplicate. Compounds 1 to 15 were tested using the same first assay, compounds 16 to 41 were tested in another assay based on the binding and displacement of AlexaFluor\u00ae 647 labeled, ATP-competitive Kinase inhibitor scaffold using LanthaScreen\u2122 TR-FRET technology Eu Kinase assay packet according to manufacturer's instruction (Life Technologies, Italy). The results of the two assays are comparable.</p>The IC<sub>50</sub> values (concentration causing a half maximal inhibition of control specific activity), reported in table 4, were determined by nonlinear regression analysis of the inhibition curves generated with mean replicate values using Hill equation curve fitting.\nTable 4Compound N\u00b0% Inhibition [10 \u00b5M]IC<sub>50</sub> [\u00b5M]1920.672850.873940.694-0.035-0.056-0.077-0.068-0.029-0.2010-0.0311-0.8912-0.5613-0.5614-1.4015-0.0516-0.5818-1.0624-1.0325-0.2225b-0.5326-0.9127-0.1028-0.1129-0.0330-0.0231-0.9632-3.9133-1.0434-1.0735-2.0436-3.4237-0.9738-0.7839-0.9540-0.884171-</p>The results showed that the compounds according to the present invention had good inhibitory activity in this assay: at 10 \u00b5M the % of inhibition is greater than 70% and the IC<sub>50</sub> is obtained with less than 4.00 \u00b5M of each compound. Most compounds showed an IC50 value lower than 1.50 \u00b5M.</p>Test II - Selectivity on GSK-3\u03b2 (test in vitro)(a) Compounds 1 and 2 were tested against a panel of 60 kinases in order to assess their selectivity. The assays were chosen taking into consideration the diversity of assay families.</p>Tested kinases were representative of following kinase sub-families:\nprotein-serine/threonine kinases;protein-tyrosine kinases;other kinases; andatypical kinases.</p>Human recombinant kinases were incubated in the presence of specific peptide substrates plus ATP for different times (10, 15, 30, 60 or 90 minutes) at 22\u00b0C. Phosphorylated substrate was detected by LANCE or HTRF technology (CISBIO, MA, USA).
