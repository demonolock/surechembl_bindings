    "uting one or more amino acids in the portions to alter potency of the portions for inhibiting CaMKII activity. In certain embodiments, mutations are generated to increase CaMKII inhibition. For example, mutational analysis of CN19 demonstrated that inhibitory potency can be significantly further enhanced. In one example, an Alanine (Ala) scan (individual amino acid substitutions with Ala) identified 3 amino acid positions (P3, K13, R14) for which alanine substitutions/mutations clearly enhanced inhibitory potency. Several additional amino acid positions had slightly enhanced potency or no effect. Additionally, amino acid positions can be replaced with positive residues (R or K) without loss of inhibitory potency. For example, this could be used to further enhance cell-penetration. In other embodiments, it is contemplated that molecules of CaM-KIIN portions can be altered to reduce phosphorylation of the portions which can alter potency of inhibition. For example, CN19 contains one amino acid, Ser12, that could be phosphorylated (e.g. by PKC) within cells, thereby reducing CN19's inhibitory effect. In one example, a single mutant R14A was very potent. S12 can be mutated, for example to R or V, without loss of potency. In certain methods disclosed herein, it may be desirable to have a composition having increased inhibitory potency compared to a wild type CN molecule composition. In other embodiments, it was demonstrated that CN19o potency was improved by over 100 fold with an IC50 of less than 1 nM. In addition, CN19o (SEQ ID NO: 24) demonstrated about 50,000 fold selectivity of inhibition of CaMKII over CaMKI.</p>In some embodiments, it may be desirable to regulate the inhibition of CaMKII by any peptide disclosed herein whether in a subject or in a laboratory setting. In accordance with embodiments, post-translational modifications or other cellular signaling methods may be used to regulate the peptide's activities regarding inhibition of CaMKII or CaMKI. For example, a protein kinase can be used to phosphorylate one or more peptides disclosed herein to reduce the inhibition potency of the peptide (e.g. S12 of CN19o can be phosphorylated), thus providing methods for closely regulating CaMKII and CaMKIIN\u03b1 activities.</p>In certain embodiments, CN inhibitors contemplated herein can be made to be cell-penetrating. In other embodiments, compositions contemplated herein may be administered to a cell or to a subject by any method known in the art (e.g. microbeads, microspheres, microparticles, slow release gel). In other embodiments, CN inhibitors can be made for penetrating a cell by for example, covalent fusion with the cell-penetrating ant (derived from the antennapedia protein; also called penetratin, SEQ ID NO:16) or tat (from the HIV tat protein, SEQ ID NO:15) sequences. However, in certain exemplary methods ant was found to interfere with general calmodulin signaling (thereby interfering with specificity) by direct binding to calmodulin, and ef",

Kits contemplated of use herein can include a kit for medical applications or kits for research applications for further study.</p>EXAMPLESEmbodiments herein are further illustrated by the following examples and detailed protocols. However, the examples are merely intended to illustrate embodiments and are not to be construed to limit the scope herein. The contents of all references and published patents and patent applications cited throughout this application are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>Example 1In certain exemplary methods, portions or peptides of CaM-KIIN are generated. In certain examples, peptides are 21 amino acids in length. As represented in FIG. 1. CN21a (CN) contains full CaMKII inhibitory potency and specificity of CaM-KIINtide. FIG. 1A represents CN peptides relative to the sequence of CaM-KIINtide, termed CN27. Darker bars indicate greater CaMKII inhibitory potential found in this study. In FIG. 1B, CN21a contains the full inhibitory potency. Deletion of the 3 N-terminal amino acids of CN21a abolishes inhibition, while C-terminal deletion reduces it. In another example, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-induced CaMKII activity was measured by <sup>32</sup>P incorporation into the peptide substrate AC2. In FIG. 1C, CN21a specificity was tested on a panel of different kinases (at 5 \u03bcM, 50-fold IC50). Kinase activity without inhibitor was normalized to 100% for each kinase. CaMKII activity was completely blocked, while activities of the other kinases were not affected. Individual data points of duplicate assays are shown. In FIG. 1D, CN27 and CN21 were demonstrated to inhibit both major brain CaMKII isoforms, \u03b1 and \u03b2. Error bars indicate s.e.m.</p>In another exemplary experiment, CNs were demonstrated to differentially inhibit phosphorylation of two peptide substrates (see FIGS. 2A-2C). In one example, FIG. 2A represents that CN peptides (e.g. 1 \u03bcM) block CaMKII phosphorylation of the peptide substrate syntide2 (derived from a phosphorylation site on glycogen synthase), but only reduce phosphorylation of AC2 (derived from the auto-phosphorylation site around T286). FIG. 2B represents that AC2 interferes with CaMKII inhibition by CN21. Kinase assays were done in presence of 0.1 or 0.5 \u03bcM CN21 with 80 \u03bcM syntide2 as the principle substrate; AC2 was added at the indicated concentration. Kinase activity is shown as % of maximal activity without CN21 peptide. Error bars indicate s.e.m. Inhibition by CN21 is competitive with AC2, demonstrated in FIG. 2C. Standard kinase assays were performed with 10 nM CaMKII, 1 \u03bcM CaM, and varying concentrations of AC2 (40, 13.33, 8, and 5 \u03bcM) and CN21 (0, 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 \u03bcM). In a Lineweaver-Burk plot, increasing the CN21 concentration has a much stronger effect on apparent \u22121/k<sub>m </sub>(x-axis intersection) than on apparent 1/v<s",
    "till clearly affected CaMKII activity (FIG. 1B). Thus, the full inhibitory activity is contained in CN21a (CaM-KIIN 43-63). CN21a also blocked phosphorylation of crude liver protein extracts and of bacterially expressed GST-NR2B-c (FIGS. 14A-14C). CN21a (5 \u03bcM) blocks CaMKII phosphorylation of (FIG. 14A) crude live protein extracts, (FIG. 14B) bacterially expressed GST-NR2B-c (containing C-terminal NR2B amino acid 1,120 to 1,482), and (FIG. 14C) T305 but not T286 autophosphorylation. Phosphorylation was detected by <sup>32</sup>P autoradiography (FIG. 14A, 14B), or by phosphospecific antibodies (FIG. 14C). In FIGS. 14A and 14B, CaMKII was autophosphorylated before the final reactions I3 min at 30\u00b0 C.) in order to reduce the T286 signal.</p>Example 7FIGS. 15A-15D represent CN19, a minimal inhibitor region of CaM-KIIN. FIG. 15A represents a previously identified CaM-KIIN inhibitory region, CN21. Arrows indicate truncations that lead to reduced potency of CaMKII inhibition. Truncation of the N-terminus by 2 amino acids completely abolished CaMKII inhibition, and potency was significantly reduced even by deleting only 1 amino acid. However, C-terminal truncation by 1 or 2 amino acids did not affect potency. Only further truncation by 3 amino acids significantly reduced potency (see FIG. 15C). Thus, the C-terminally truncated CN19 contains the minimal inhibitory region with full inhibitory potency. Phosphorylation of syntide 2 by CaMKII was inhibited by CN21, CN20 and CN19 with an IC50 of \u02dc100 nM (FIG. 15D). Syntide 2 is a \u201cregular\u201d S-site binding CaMKII substrate and CN peptides inhibit its phosphorylation in a non-competitive manner. FIGS. 15B-15D represent that this particular CN19 retains full inhibitory potency, while any other further truncations are shown to reduce inhibitory potency, as determined by the effect on CaMKII activity in a biochemical assay of phosphate incorporation into the substrate peptides AC2 or syntide 2, as indicated. It is contemplated that other reductions or substitution are considered in embodiments herein and that other amino acid sequences of 19 or less amino acids can retain inhibitory capabilities. It is also contemplated that certain amino acid sequences of 21 amino acids or less in this region may be better suited for therapeutic treatments than others. Bars grouped and labeled (**) do not differ from each other as determined by ANOVA. Error bars indicate s.e.m. in all cases.</p>FIGS. 16A and 16B illustrate that tatCN21 dramatically reduces CaMKI activity (**). Tat alone and other tat fusions had statistically significant but much milder effects on CaMKI (*). CN27, 21, and 19 alone had no significant effect on CaMKI activity (nd; ANOVA). FIG. 16B represents a dose response of CaMKI inhibition by tatCN21, tat, and CN21 further demonstrates that CaMKI inhibition dramatically enhanced by the specific fusion. Error bars indicate s.e.m. in all cases.</p>Example 8In another exemplary method, a mutational analysis of CN19",
    "ations that can prevent phosphorylation of CN peptides within cells, thereby preventing inactivation.</p>FIGS. 20A-20C illustrate potency of combination mutants I. FIG. 20A represents the combination mutants aX, a3, a4, and a5 that have significantly increased potency of CaMKII inhibition over CN19 wild type. However, potency over the single mutant 13A is mildly increased, if at all, and potency over the single mutant 14A is dramatically decreased. The a3 mutant showed slightly better inhibition than the aX mutant, indicating that a 3,14A mutant (now called a2) might be beneficial over 14A alone. FIG. 20B represents several additional combination mutants at higher concentration. The better inhibition of by a3 compared to aX (13/14A) was confirmed. FIG. 20C represents that P4 appears to be unable to be mutated without reduction in potency, even in a background that contains a P3A mutation. Thus, it is likely that helical structure at the CN19 N-terminus cannot be extended beyond the 3<sup>rd </sup>amino acid. Error bars indicate s.e.m. in all cases.</p>FIGS. 21A-21C represents potency of combination mutants II. (FIGS. 21A and 21B) Dose response showed that potency of the CN19a3 mutant is significantly increased over CN19 wild type. FIG. 21C represents that an a2 mutant has higher potency than the a3 mutant (predicted from FIG. 20), as it shows significant inhibition even at 10 nM (in contrast to a3; see panel B). However, the single mutant 14A has even higher potency, with an IC50 in the single digit nM range. Thus, its potency is increased well over 10 fold compared to CN19 wild type. In context of the a2 mutant, mutations of position 19 to A or C were detrimental, while mutation to Y was not. Error bars indicate s.e.m. in all cases.</p>Example 9CN19 phosphorylation at S12 by protein kinase C reduces potency of CaMKII inhibition. In another exemplary method, protein kinase C (PKC) activity was examined with respect to CN19 as a substrate or the S12 mutant. It was observed that S12 can be phosphorylated by PKC and most but not all S12 mutations decrease potency. The CN19 region most sensitive to Ala substitutions (surrounding R11) contains a potential PKC phosphorylation site (S12). CN19 but not its S12A mutant was phosphorylated by PKC, with a phosphorylation rate of &gt;50% compared to a peptide derived from a major PKC substrate protein (FIG. 22A) (using MARCKS; myristylated alanin-rich C-kinase substrate). Additionally, the phospho-mimetic S12D mutation of CN19 significantly decreased potency of CaMKII inhibition (FIG. 22B). This experiment demonstrates that CaMKII inhibition by CaM-KIIN or CN peptides (e.g. CN19) can be modulated by cellular signaling leading to S12 phosphorylation. For example, the post-translational modification can interfere with CaMKII inhibition. In another experiment, in order to prevent such inactivating effect when using CN peptides (e.g. as research tools or for modulating events in a subject) for CaMKII inhibition w",
    "KC phosphorylated CN19 but not its S12A mutant in vitro, as measured by phosphate incorporation. The phosphorylation rate of CN19 was &gt;50% compared to a MARCKS peptide substrate of PKC. B. Phospho-mimetic S12D mutation significantly reduced CN19 ability to inhibit CaMKII activity (measured by syntide 2 phosphorylation in vitro). S12 was sensitive also to various other mutations (see Table 1 and data not shown). Error bars indicate s.e.m. in all panels.</p>Example 10In another method, alternative substitution of S12 with other residues was evaluated. Combining mutations to further increase CN19 potency were evaluated. In order to improve potency of inhibitory effects of CN peptides, combinations of three mutations that individually increased potency of CaMKII inhibition were examined A triple mutant having amino acid substitutions as follows: P3A, K13A, R14A (CN19a3) significantly increased potency compared to single mutant with the highest potency, R14A (FIG. 23A). It was demonstrated that the largest increase in CaMKII inhibition potency was observed for the double mutant P3A, R14A (CN19a2) (FIG. 23A).</p>In addition, CN19a2 (with the double mutation) could be combined with an amino acid substitution, S12V (CN19a2v) to prevent S12 phosphorylation without loss of inhibition potency (FIG. 23B). It was demonstrated that potency of CN19a2v was significantly stronger compared to CN19a3 with additional S12V mutation (CN19a3v) (FIG. 23B). It was demonstrated that CN19a2v had an IC50 of \u02dc20 nM (FIG. 23B); the potency of CN19a2v was about 5-fold greater than CN19 (see FIG. 17A).</p>Several additional rounds of mutations (which mainly tested substitutions in CN19 wt, a2, or a3 with positively charged R or K residues) did not yield any further improvements over CN19a2v. However, several residues that could be substituted without reduction in potency were identified (data not shown). This included positions 3 (K), 5 (R), 7 (R,K), 8 (K), and 9 (L). The results, inferring the effects of all tested substitutions individually, are summarized in Table 1.</p>FIGS. 23A and 23B represent CN19a2v (SEQ ID NO: 23), a combination mutant. Effect of CN19 peptides (20 nM) on CaMKII activity towards syntide 2 in vitro was examined. A, CN19a2 (P3A, R14A, SEQ ID NO: 25) was the most potent double mutant of CN19, and also more potent that the triple mutant CN19a3 (P3A, K13A, R14A) (**, p&lt;0.01). B, S12V mutation of CN19a2 (CN19a2v) did not reduce potency, and was more potent than a S12V mutant of CN19a3 (***, no difference between a2 and a2v, but p&lt;0.001 compared to the other conditions). Error bars indicate s.e.m. in all panels.</p>Example 11In other exemplary methods additional strategies were implemented to further improve potency of CN19 to block CaMKII activity. Initial Ala scans revealed that amino acid position R11 is the single most important charged residue for potency of CaMKII inhibition. Because a minimal consensus sequence for CaMKII substrates is RxxS/T, it was reasoned that R11 might provide the R at the \u22123 position for a pseudo-substrate sequence within CN19 that directly blocks the substrate binding site (see for example FIG. 24A). Thus, several mutations were examined that make the CN19a2v region around R11 closer to an optimal CaMKII substrate sequence (without introducing a phosphorylatable residue to the peptide) (FIG. 24A): Although less important than the R at the \u22123 position, CaMKII has been determined to prefer substrates with hydrophobic residues at the \u22125 and +1 positions and also shows some preference for substrates with Q at \u22122, F at +1 and D at +2 positions. Both V12Q and V16D have been demonstrated to significantly increase potency of CN19 (see for example FIG. 24B). V15I also increased potency, however, the V15F mutation in this position did not (FIG. 24B). The V12Q and V16D mutants of CN19a2v had an IC50 of about 1 nM, and a combination mutant (referred to as CN19o) increased potency even further (FIG. 24C). 5 nM CN19o blocked CaMKII activity nearly completely (supplemental FIG. S6). Additional combination of CN19o with V15I or V15F did not further increase potency of inhibition (FIG. 24C).</p>FIGS. 24A to 24C represent how another approach to mutagenesis dramatically improved potency in the peptide, CN19o (SEQ ID NO: 24). A, Sequence alignment illustrates the rational for further mutagenesis. The initial Ala scan indicated that R11 of CN19 may constitute the \u22123 position R of a pseudo-substrate sequence. B, The CN19a2v mutations V12Q, V15I and V16D dramatically increase CaMKII inhibition. C, The optimal combination mutant of CN19a2v was V12Q, V16D (CN19o). Additional V15F mutation did not further increase inhibition of CaMKII (0.5 nM), and all other combination mutants showed less CaMKII inhibition (**, p&lt;0.05). Error bars indicate s.e.m. in all panels.</p>Example 12It was unexpected when it was observed that CN19o (SEQ ID NO: 24) has both highly increased potency, as well as, selectivity and may be the optimum peptide for selective inhibition of CaMKII activity. CN19o (SEQ ID NO: 24) inhibited CaMKII with an IC50 of about 0.75 nM (FIG. 25A), and thus CN19o (SEQ ID NO: 24) has &gt;125fold enhanced potency compared to CN19. If any, this result underestimates the potency of CN19o (SEQ ID NO: 24): Even though concentration of CaMKII in this assay was significantly reduced compared to standard assays (to 0.1 nM), the inhibitor excess at the determined IC50 was only 7.5fold.</p>Further investigation revealed that CaMKI inhibition by CN19o (SEQ ID NO: 24) (about 38 \u03bcM IC50) was reduced compared to CN19a2v (about 18 \u03bcM IC50). CaMKI inhibition by CN19o (SEQ ID NO: 24) was demonstrated to be similar to CN19 (about 36 \u03bcM IC50) (FIG. 26). Thus, the resulting selectivity of CN19o for CaMKII vs CaMKI is about 50,000fold (about 125-fold greater than other peptides disclosed herein).</p>Additionally, CN19o was tested for effects on a panel of other kinases (see for example FIG. 25B). This panel included other CaM kinase family members (CaMKIV, DAPK1, AMPK) and other basophilic multifunctional kinases (protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC)). When increased to 5 \u03bcM (&gt;6,500fold IC50 for CaMKII), CN19o (SEQ ID NO: 24) did not significantly affect activity of these other kinases tested. Thus, CN19o (SEQ ID NO: 24) inhibits CaMKII both with remarkable potency and high selectivity. Certain embodiments disclosed herein may be directed at using a highly potent inhibitor of CaMKII (e.g. CN19o) or a less potent inhibitor of CaMKII depending on the circumstances and the need.</p>FIGS. 25A and 25B represent increased potency and selectivity of CN19o (SEQ ID NO: 24). A, The IC50 for CaMKII inhibition by CN19o (SEQ ID NO: 24) is about 0.75 nM, as indicated by CaMKII activity assays. CaMKII concentration was lowered to 0.1 nM for CN19o (SEQ ID NO: 24) concentration below 5 nM. B, While 5 nM CN19o (SEQ ID NO: 24) completely blocked CaMKII activity, even 5 \u03bcM CN19o (&gt;6,500fold IC50 of CaMKII inhibition) did not significantly affect kinase activity of CaMKI, CaMKIV, DAPK1, AMPK, PKA, or PKC. Error bars indicate s.e.m. in all panels.</p>FIG. 26 represents CN19, CN19a2v, and CN19o inhibition of CaMKI, which were observed to be 360-50,000 fold less potency compared to inhibition of CaMKII. The IC50 for CaMKI inhibition of CN19 (36 mM), CN19a2v (18 mM) and CN19o (38 mM) 360-50,000-fold greater than their IC50 for CaMKII inhibition (100 nM, 20 nM and 0.75 nM, respectively; compare FIGS. 15, 23 and 26). For curve fit, the Hill coefficient was set as 1.</p>TABLE 1Effects of individual CN19 mutations on CaMKII inhibition summaryand improvements over certain previously examined mutantsCN19+~\u2212\u20021 KAR\u20022 RA\u20023 PA~K &gt; R\u20024 PA K\u20025 KRAR\u20026 LA\u20027 GRKR\u20028 QA KR\u20029 ILAR10 GA11 RA12 SQ*VRA KDGPNFL13 KA14 RA15 V(I)*AR(F)*16 VD*AR17 IARK18 EAR19 DAR CMutations that were combined for the optimized CN19o are marked in bold and underlined in the second column.Asterisks indicate the rational mutagenesis.</p>Materials and MethodsPeptides and proteins.
