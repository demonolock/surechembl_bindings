    "o the second column, mixed up and down 10 times using a pipette and the pipette tip was thereafter discarded; the subsequent seven concentrations were then prepared sequentially using the same procedure. Twenty-four hours after plating, diluted antibody was added at 20 ul per well with an additional control established; only 20 ul of detection medium was added to Column 11, two duplicate wells were established for each concentration and cells were vortexed at 550 rpm for three minutes following addition.</p>4) AssayAfter four days, the MTS reagent was removed and samples were thawed at room temperature while ensuring no light exposure and thorough vortexing was performed; 20 \u00b5L of CellTiter 96\u00ae One Solution Reagen MTS reagent was added for every 100 \u00b5L of cell culture volume along the side wall of the wells, and the plate surface was gently tapped to mix the MTS solution evenly, after which the samples were placed in a cell culture incubator for static incubation for two hours while ensuring no light exposure occurred. After the reaction was finished, the 96-well plate was taken out, OD490 nm absorbance values were assayed using a microplate reader, and corresponding data was recorded, sorted, and stored.</p>5) ResultsAs shown in Table 2 and Figures 1 through 3, good anti-tumor activity was demonstrated in the cell lines BT474/SKBR3/N87. Due to the similarity of their structures, Compounds 1 through 14 also exhibit relatively favorable anti-tumor activity.\nTable 2NumberBT474 IC50 (nM)SKBR3 IC50 (nM)N87 IC50 (nM)Herceptin-007-a ma-319.310.2111.72Herceptin-007-ama-4200\u223c1000&gt; 1000&gt; 1000Herceptin-007 -ama-6200\u223c1000&gt;1000\u223c1000Herceptin-007-ama-89.870.156.61Herceptin-007-ama-934.770.145.92Herceptin-007-ama-107.360.1424.19Herceptin-007-A0301&gt; 10000.25&gt;1000</p>In the preceding section, embodiments of the present invention were described in detail in conjunction with examples in order to fully elucidate how the present invention uses certain technical means to solve corresponding technical problems and achieve technical efficacy, and these may be used as a basis for implementation.
