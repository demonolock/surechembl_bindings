    "ned anti-CD47\u00d7anti-EGFR bispecifics to block SIRP\u03b1 binding to the target Fadu cell line that expressed the CD47 antigen and the EGFR antigen. These experiments, yielded a set of 8 variants that showed a 10-fold to 20-fold decreased affinity for the non-target CD47+/EGFR-Raji cell line relative to the non-detuned anti-CD47\u00d7anti-EGFR parental antibody, and yet was still able to block 75-90% SIRP\u03b1 binding to the CD47+/EGFR+ Fadu target cell line.</p>The rituximab anti-CD20 arm was paired with the 8 detuned anti-CD47 variants similarly using an IgG1 Fc. It was observed that the detuned CD47\u00d7CD20 bispecifics had reduced binding to the CD47<sup>+</sup>/CD20\u2212 non-target Fadu cell line relative to the non-detuned CD47\u00d7CD20 parental antibody, and yet were still able to block 75-90% of SIRP\u03b1 binding to the target Raji cell line which was CD47 and CD20 positive.</p>Additional developability assessments of the variants led to the selection of a single anti-CD47 Fab variant, VH E59Y/S102E, which was cloned into three CC-90002 derived frameworks, for pharmacokinetic testing in cynomolgus monkeys: TPP-1367, TPP-1360, and TPP-1361.</p>Example 4: Summary of SPR Binding Results for Bispecific Entities Described HereinSurface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) experiments were used to measure the affinities of TPP-1360 to CD47. TPP-1360 was tested for binding to human CD47 and cynomolgus CD47, and were found to not bind to mouse CD47. TPP-1360 was measured to have an affinity for human CD47 ECD of 1.7 \u03bcM Kd, which reflects \u02dc350\u00d7 decrease in affinity relative to the parental anti-CD47 binder. The TPP-1360 affinity for the cynomolgus CD47 ECD was found to be 4.51 \u03bcM Kd. in addition to the measured affinity, a sandwich SPR assay demonstrated that TPP-1360 bound CD47 and CD20 simultaneously.</p>Example 5: Dose Response of Binding and SIRP\u03b1 Blocking of Example Bispecific EntitiesDose response curves for TPP-1360 blocking of human SIRP\u03b1 binding to various CD20 expressing non-Hodgkins lymphoma tumor cell lines were generated. Cell lines were incubated with increasing concentrations of the bispecific, then human SIRP\u03b1 was added at a saturating concentration. In addition to the bispecific, rituximab and the parental anti-CD47 binder (TPP-23 which is 408_437 with IgG1) were included for reference. Cells were washed then incubated with a secondary antibody to measure the amount of SIRP\u03b1 bound to the tumor cells. For cell line OCI-Ly3 (a DLBCL cell line), TPP-1360 was found to have an EC50=1.30 nM. For the Raji cell line (a B-lymphocyte Burkitt's lymphoma cell line) TPP-1360 was found to have an EC50=1.64 nM. The parental anti-CD47, TPP-23, was found to have an IC<sub>50 </sub>of 0.11 nM for blocking human SIRP\u03b1 binding to OCI-Ly3 cells as shown in FIG. 21. Rituximab had no effect on SIRP\u03b1 binding.</p>Example 6: Dose Response for PhagocytosisDose response curve for TPP-1360 activation of phagocytosis towards various CD20 expressing non-Hodgkins lymphoma tumor cell lines were generated. Human monocytes were differentiated into macrophages, which were then added to tumor cell lines that had been incubated with increasing concentrations of either bispecific. In addition to the bispecific entities, rituximab and the parental anti-CD47 binder (TPP-23) were included for reference. Fluorescence labeling of macrophages and tumor cells was used to measure the number of phagocytic events using an image based quantification method. For the OCI-Ly3 cell line, TPP-1360 was found to have an IC50=1.4 nM. For the Raji cell line, TPP-1360 was found to have an IC50=1.8 nM.</p>Example 7: Binding Studies with Human and Cyno RBCs and HemagluttinationBinding of certain bispecific entity examples to human and cynomolgus monkey RBCs was determined to assess their non-target cell binding potential. RBCs were isolated from whole blood and were incubated with increasing concentrations of the example bispecifics. Binding was expressed as a percentage of the amount of binding observed at 2 \u03bcg/ml of the parental anti-CD47 binder (TPP-23). At 200 \u03bcg/ml, TPP-1360 and TPP-1361 bound to &lt;1% of that seen for the parental anti-CD47 binding to human RBCs. Similarly, at 200 \u03bcg/ml, TPP-1360 bound to &lt;1% of that seen for the parental anti-CD47 binding to cynomolgus RBCs. Finally, the parental anti-CD47 binders for both leads demonstrated no hemagluttination of human RBCs at 200 \u03bcg/ml. Similarly, both TPP-1360 and TPP-1361 showed no hemagluttination at 200 \u03bcg/ml. BRIC6, a known hemagluttinating antibody was used as a positive control.</p>Example 8: Binding Studies to Human PBMCs and Whole BloodBinding of the bispecific entity species described herein to human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) was assessed. Relative to the parental anti-CD47 binder TPP-23 and rituximab, the TPP-1360 bispecific showed less binding to all cell types with the exception of the B-cells, which showed significant binding through the presence of the anti-CD20 Fab portion.</p>Example 9: First Round Lead Cynomolgus PKA cynomolgus PK experiment was carried out with ex",
    "the high affinity for CD47 found in TPP-23.</p>The overall binding profile of TPP-1360 in human whole blood is similar to rituximab. Conversely, the parental CD47 mAb, TPP-23, used as a control for CD47 expression, significantly bound to all cell populations in human blood.</p>B. Tumor Cell BindingFurthermore, the RBC binding capacity of TPP-1360, for example, was extensively evaluated in purified human RBCs and in co-culture of human RBCs with tumor cells. As illustrated in FIG. 8, TPP-1360 selectively bound CD47<sup>+</sup>/CD20<sup>+</sup> Raji Cells but not CD47<sup>+</sup>/CD20<sup>\u2212</sup> human RBCs. Moreover, in a co-culture of Raji cells and human RBCs, TPP-1360 displayed dose-dependent binding to CD47<sup>+</sup>/CD20<sup>+</sup> Raji cells but no binding to human RBCs, even at concentration as high as 1 mg/mL. See, FIG. 9. To the contrary, the parental CD47 type/CD20 bispecific, TPP-2, significantly bound to both Raji cells and human RBCs. In addition, TPP-1360 does not show binding to purified cyno RBC from multiple donors.</p>C. SIRP\u03b1 CompetitionHaving demonstrated its selective binding to CD20<sup>+</sup>/CD47<sup>+</sup> cells, an assessment was made of the ability of TPP-1360 to antagonize human SIRP\u03b1 interaction with cell surface CD47 using an in vitro competition assay. TPP-1360 potently and blocked recombinant human SIRP\u03b1-Fc binding to human CD47 expressed on the surface of CD20<sup>+</sup>/CD47<sup>+</sup> lymphoma cell lines OCI-Ly3 and Raji, with average EC50 values of 1.30 nM and 1.64 nM, respectively. See, FIG. 10 and FIG. 11. FIG. 10 illustrates the fact that TPP-1360, for example, potently and completely blocked recombinant human SIRP\u03b1-Fc binding to human CD47 expressed on the surface of CD20<sup>+</sup>/CD47<sup>+</sup> lymphoma cell line OCI-Ly3. FIG. 11 illustrates the fact that TPP-1360, for example, potently and completely blocked recombinant human SIRP\u03b1-Fc binding to human CD47 expressed on the surface of CD20<sup>+</sup>/CD47<sup>+</sup> lymphoma cell line Raji. In contrast, neither rituximab nor control bispecific antibody TPP-1480 (anti-CD20/hen egg lysozyme) were able to compete with human SIRP\u03b1-Fc binding to the same cell lines. The data presented herein also demonstrates that TPP-1360 potency to block human SIRP\u03b1-CD47 interaction is lower than TPP-23, consistent with the attenuated affinity of TPP-1360 to human CD47.</p>Example 12: Functional Activities: Human Macrophage PhagocytosisThis Example demonstrates the capacity of TPP-1360 in triggering tumor phagocytosis, as determined in vitro by automated counting of \u201ceaten\u201d CD20<sup>+</sup> CD47<sup>+</sup> tumor cells inside of labeled macrophages.</p>Expression of CD20 and CD47 was first verified in each target tumor cell line (OCI-Ly3, Raji, REC-1, and RIVA) by quantifying antibody binding capacity (ABC) using a flow cytometric assay (Denny T N et al., Cytometry. 1996 December; 26(4):265-74). All four cell lines express high levels of CD47 and CD20. Table 1.</"
