{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\nTPP-1360 was measured to have an affinity for human CD47 ECD of 1.7 \u03bcM Kd, which reflects \u02dc350\u00d7 decrease in affinity relative to the parental anti-CD47 binder.\nThe TPP-1360 affinity for the cynomolgus CD47 ECD was found to be 4.51 \u03bcM Kd.\nFor cell line OCI-Ly3 (a DLBCL cell line), TPP-1360 was found to have an EC50=1.30 nM.\nFor the Raji cell line (a B-lymphocyte Burkitt's lymphoma cell line) TPP-1360 was found to have an EC50=1.64 nM.\nThe parental anti-CD47, TPP-23, was found to have an IC50 of 0.11 nM for blocking human SIRP\u03b1 binding to OCI-Ly3 cells as shown in FIG. 21.\nFor the OCI-Ly3 cell line, TPP-1360 was found to have an IC50=1.4 nM.\nFor the Raji cell line, TPP-1360 was found to have an IC50=1.8 nM."}
