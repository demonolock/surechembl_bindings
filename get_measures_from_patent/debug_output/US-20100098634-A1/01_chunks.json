    "heavy senile plaque burden in the cerebral cortex, verified by post mortem histopathological examination. Interestingly, despite the development and presence of senile plaques in elderly persons with normal cognitive function, the severity of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and senile plaque deposition purportedly correlates with a loss of cognitive function and neuronal circuitry deterioration. Mature senile plaques consist of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles derived from filaments of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, and extracellular \u03b2-amyloid peptides derived from enzymatic processing of amyloid precursor protein.</p>Amyloidosis is characterized by the progressive, bulk accumulation of insoluble fibrillary proteins in the patient tissue, leading ultimately to morbidity. Deposition of amyloid occurs via aggregation of the fibrillary proteins, followed by further combination or aggregation thereof. With respect to AD, accumulation of aggregates of amyloid peptides A\u03b2<sub>40 </sub>and A\u03b2<sub>42 </sub>are the major peptides found in senile plaque and cerebrovascular deposits in patents (see Xia, et al., J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 97: 9299 (2000) and Hardy, et al, Science 2002, 297, 353). Prevention of the deposition of these peptide fragments, which are derived from amyloid precursor proteins, continues to be a primary therapeutic research goal. Due to the central role of \u03b3-secretase in the generation of the A\u03b2 peptides via cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), inhibition of \u03b3-secretase has been identified as an important target in the discovery of novel AD treatments (see, for example, Ziani-Cherif, et al, Curr. Pharm. Design 2006, 12, 4313-4335; Evin, et al, CNS Drugs 2006, 20, 351-372; and Lahiri, et al., Drug Dev. Res. 2002, 56, 267-281).</p>Diagnosis of AD has been traditionally performed via post-mortem tissue studies, brain biopsies or clinical evaluation [see, for example, McKhann, et al., Neurology, 34: 939 (1984) and Khachaturian, Arch. Neurol., 42: 1097 (1985)]. AD is clinically characterized by the presence of neurotic plaques (NP), neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and neuronal loss (see. Mann, Mech. Aging Dev. 31: 213 (1985). Neurotic plaques are a ubiquitous aspect of the disease (Mann et al., J. Neurol. Sci., 89: 169), the assessment of which must be performed in postmortem studies.</p>Unfortunately, at the stage of presentation of symptoms in the clinic, the patients have developed significant amyloid deposition in the neurological tissue. More recently, earlier diagnosis has been the subject of research efforts aimed at immunoassay techniques, genetic testing and radiological imaging technologies.</p>Discovery of point mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP) in several rare families with an autosomal dominant form of AD provided evidence that abnormalities in A\u03b2 metabolism are necessary and sufficient for the development of AD (see, for example, Hardy, Nature Genetics, 1: 233 (1992); and Hardy, et al., Science, 25",
