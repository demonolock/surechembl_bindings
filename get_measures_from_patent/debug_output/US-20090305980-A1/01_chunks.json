    "t with the mRNA of TR4 or the genomic DNA of TR4 or they can interact with the polypeptide TR4. Often functional nucleic acids are designed to interact with other nucleic acids based on sequence homology between the target molecule and the functional nucleic acid molecule. In other situations, the specific recognition between the functional nucleic acid molecule and the target molecule is not based on sequence homology between the functional nucleic acid molecule and the target molecule, but rather is based on the formation of tertiary structure that allows specific recognition to take place.</p>Antisense molecules are designed to interact with a target nucleic acid molecule through either canonical or non-canonical base pairing. The interaction of the antisense molecule and the target molecule is designed to promote the destruction of the target molecule through, for example, RnaseH mediated RNA-DNA hybrid degradation. Alternatively the antisense molecule is designed to interrupt a processing function that normally would take place on the target molecule, such as transcription or replication. Antisense molecules can be designed based on the sequence of the target molecule. Numerous methods for optimization of antisense efficiency by finding the most accessible regions of the target molecule exist. Exemplary methods would be in vitro selection experiments and DNA modification studies using DMS and DEPC. It is preferred that antisense molecules bind the target molecule with a dissociation constant (k<sub>d</sub>)less than 10<sup>\u22126</sup>. It is more preferred that antisense molecules bind with a k<sub>d </sub>less than 10<sup>\u22128</sup>. It is also more preferred that the antisense molecules bind the target molecule with a k<sub>d </sub>less than 10<sup>\u221210</sup>. It is also preferred that the antisense molecules bind the target molecule with a k<sub>d </sub>less than 10<sup>\u221212</sup>. A representative sample of methods and techniques which aid in the design and use of antisense molecules can be found in the following non-limiting list of U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,135,917, 5,294,533, 5,627,158, 5,641,754, 5,691,317, 5,780,607, 5,786,138, 5,849,903, 5,856,103, 5,919,772, 5,955,590, 5,990,088, 5,994,320, 5,998,602, 6,005,095, 6,007,995, 6,013,522, 6,017,898, 6,018,042, 6,025,198, 6,033,910, 6,040,296, 6,046,004, 6,046,319, and 6,057,437.</p>Aptamers are molecules that interact with a target molecule, preferably in a specific way. Typically aptamers are small nucleic acids ranging from 15-50 bases in length that fold into defined secondary and tertiary structures, such as stem-loops or G-quartets. Aptamers can bind small molecules, such as ATP (U.S. Pat. No. 5,631,146) and theophiline (U.S. Pat. No. 5,580,737), as well as large molecules, such as reverse transcriptase (U.S. Pat. No. 5,786,462) and thrombin (U.S. Pat. No. 5,543,293). Aptamers can bind very tightly with k<sub>d</sub>s from the target molecule of less than 10<sup>\u221212 </sup>M. It is preferred that ",
    "heterogeneity of mediators of vitamin E action suggests there is a common element that there is a receptor or a co-receptor, able to interact with vitamin E and with transcription factors directed toward specific regions of promoter sequences of sensitive genes. Disclosed herein, TR4 promotes vitamin E anti-ROS actions via interacting with vitamin E in the cells (facilitating uptake, preventing degradation, or directly binding). To examine TR4 effects on the vitamin E stability in the cells, vitamin E levels are measured in the TR4- and vector-transfected cells when treated with vitamin E and vehicle control at different time points. When TR4-transfected cells have higher vitamin E levels or longer half-life, how TR4 affects vitamin E uptake/degradation pathways is examined by examining the potential cross-talk with vitamin E transfer proteins, such as tocopherol-associated proteins (TPA), or cytochrome p450 (CYP)-dependent hydroxylases, such as CYP3A family. TR4 is a nuclear orphan receptor and loss of TR4 results in impairment of vitamin E anti-ROS function. Therefore TR4 can be a receptor or co-receptor for vitamin E anti-oxidant effects. To examine if TR4 directly associate with vitamin E, TR4RE-Luc reporter genes assays are performed. Different TR4RE reporters are tested in different cell lines under the oxidative stress and/or combination with vitamin E treatments (dose from 1 nM to 1 \u03bcM). When vitamin E by itself can activate TR4 reporter genes, then binding affinity (Kd) is determined by Schartchard Plot analysis; in contrast, when vitamin E activates TR4 only in the presence of oxidative stress (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), that indicates TR4 associates with vitamin E in an indirect oxidative stress dependent manner.</p>Similar approaches are applied with other LMWAs (vitamin C, \u03b2-carotene, and selenium) when other LWWA-mediated anti-ROS defects are identified in TR4KO MEFs.</p>(b) Detailed Methods:</p>(i) Determination of SOD, CAT, and GPX, Protein Expression Level, and Activity:</p>Tissue preparation: Muscle, liver, and brain from TR4 KO vs wt mice at different ages are collected. Protein extracts are prepared by homogenizing mouse tissues in a buffer of 50 mM sodium phosphate/100 mM NaCl/1% Nonidet P40. The protein concentration is determined by a standard BCA assay.</p>(ii) Immunoblotting of SOD, CAT, and GPX, Proteins.</p>Total cellular protein (20 \u03bcg) is electrophoresed in 4-20% tris-glycine sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels (Novex, San Diego, Calif.).
