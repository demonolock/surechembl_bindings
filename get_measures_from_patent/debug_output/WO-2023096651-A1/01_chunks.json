    " the other circles indicate XPO7. The \u201c+\u201d labeled SLK are interacting with XPO7. </p>[0036] FIG. 2H provides images of tissues from a murine xenograft model using EGL1 and WITT CCA cell lines subjected either to scramble (control) or knockdown of SLK. The cell lines subjected to the control (scramble) had visible whitish tumor masses, whereas those subjected to SLK knockdown had much smaller tumor masses, showing SLK knockdown abrogates tumor growth in vivo. </p>[0037] FIG. 21 is a bar graph showing normalized phospho-protein levels in control and SLK knockdowns of CCA tissue (EGI-1 and WITT) resulting from a phosphokinase array. Control values are indicated by the left bar and SLK knockdown values are indicated by the right bar for each phosphoprotein assayed. The results indicate a robust decrease in AKT S473 phosphorylation upon SLK knockdown. </p>[0038] FIG. 2J is a Western blot showing XPO7 and SLK knockdown decreased AKT S473 phosphorylation in EGLl and WITT CCA cell lines. </p>[0039] FIGS. 3A-3K are a series of plots and images showing use of an SLK small molecule inhibitor as a therapeutic strategy to treat cholangiocarcinoma. </p>[0040] FIG. 3A is shows a kinome inhibition profile of tivozanib which revealed inhibitory activity against SLK. </p>[0041] FIG. 3B is a bar graph showing tivozanib inhibits AKT S473 phosphorylation in three cholangiocarcinoma cell lines (WITT, EGI-l, and SNU-1079) compared to control levels. </p>[0042] FIGS. 3C-3E are scatter plots showing IC50 values for tivozanib in three cholangiocarcinoma cell lines (WITT, EGI-l, and SNU-1079), which show that tivozanib inhibits proliferation of all three of these cholangiocarcinoma cell lines. </p>[0043] FIG. 3F shows images demonstrating that tivozanib abrogates tumor organoid formation in three cholangiocarcinoma cell lines (WITT, EGLl, and SNU-1079). Images of control are on the top row, whereas the effects of tivozanib at 200 nM are shown in the bottom row where the tumor organoids are smaller and fewer than in the control. </p>[0044] FIG. 3G is a photograph of tumors obtained in a subcutaneous xenograft model using athymic nude mice (top row = vehicle treated; bottom row = 20 mg/kg/day Tivozanib treatment for 28 days). \n\n[0045] FIG. 3H shows the quantification of final tumor volumes from the vehicle- and tivozanib-treated tumors shown in FIG. 3F. The tumor volumes of the tivozanib treated tumors were significantly smaller than in the control ( p value of &lt;0.001). </p>[0046] FIG. 31 is a waterfall plot showing substantial change in tumor volume over the course of Tivozanib treatment. </p>[0047] FIG. 3J shows micrographs of cholangiocarcinoma obtained from a patient and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) (top row) and Ki67 (bottom row). By day 4, the tivozanib treated tumor tissue showed reduction in dark stained nuclei (bottom row) as well as increased degeneration and necrosis, whereas on day 4, control tissue (0 pg/mL tivozanib) showed dark stained nucle",
    " in FIG. 2G, the small dots are XPO7, whereas the larger dots are SLK. At the position of the arrows, SLK is shown interacting with XPO7. </p>[0183] Similar to XPO7, SLK knockdown abrogated tumor growth in vivo in subcutaneous murine xenograft model. As shown in FIG. 2H, EGLl and WITT CCA tumors from a xenograft model subject to SLK knockdown have visibly smaller tumor masses than the EGLl and WITT CCA tumors subjected to the control (scramble). A phosphokinase array was used to assess the downstream molecular mechanism(s) following SLK knockdown. As shown in the bar graph in FIG. 21, this assay showed a robust decrease in AKT Serine/Threonine Kinase (AKT) S473 phosphorylation upon SLK knockdown, implicating the role of this kinase in pro-tumorigenic signaling downstream of SLK. As shown in FIG. 2J, a Western blot confirmed that both XPO7 and \n\nSLK knockdown resulted in a decrease in AKT S473 phosphorylation compared to control (scramble). </p>Example 3: Evaluation of Tivozanib as an Inhibitor of SLK and XPO7 in Cholangiocarcinoma </p>[0184] To evaluate the potential therapeutic efficacy of certain small molecules in the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma, a kinome inhibition screen was performed, identifying tivozanib, a pan- VEGFR inhibitor, as a potent inhibitor of SLK (FIG. 3A). Tivozanib inhibited AKT S473 phosphorylation in three cholangiocarcinoma cell lines, WITT, EGI-1, and SNU-1079, (FIG. 3B) and inhibited proliferation of these cells, as shown in the scatter plots of IC50 values in FIGS. 3C- 3E. </p>[0185] In a tumor organoid assay, tivozanib abrogated tumor formation in three cholangiocarcinoma cell lines, WITT, EGI-1 and SNU-1070. As shown in FIG. 3F, tumor organoids were fewer and smaller in the tivozanib treated group compared to controls. </p>[0186] In a subcutaneous xenograft model ( EGI-1 cell line), tivozanib inhibited tumor growth in vivo. As shown in FIG. 3G and 3H, tumors treated with tivozanib at 20 mg/kg/day for 28 days were statistically significantly smaller in volume than those treated with control vehicle. The substantial change in tumor volume over the course of tivozanib treatment as compared to control is shown in the waterfall plot in FIG. 31. </p>[0187] Finally, tivozanib was evaluated in the ex vivo tumor SMART platform described in International Patent Application No. WO2021/183527 which is incorporated by reference herein for all purposes. A liver metastasis from a patient with XPO7-expressing cholangiocarcinoma was evaluated using H&amp;E staining and Ki67 staining to contrast treatment with control versus tivozanib. As shown in FIG. 3J and 3K, treatment with 0.2 pg/mL tivozanib and 1 pg/mL tivozanib resulted in fewer viable cells compared to the control as well statistically significant increased cell degeneration at both dose levels, as well as statistically significant levels of cell death at the higher dose level (FIG. 3J and FIG. 3K). </p>[0188] To confirm that the tumoricidal effects of tivozanib were not d"
