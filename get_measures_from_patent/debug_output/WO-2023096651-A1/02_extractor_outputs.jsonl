Images of control are on the top row, whereas the effects of tivozanib at 200 nM are shown in the bottom row where the tumor organoids are smaller and fewer than in the control.\nFIGS. 3C-3E are scatter plots showing IC50 values for tivozanib in three cholangiocarcinoma cell lines (WITT, EGI-l, and SNU-1079), which show that tivozanib inhibits proliferation of all three of these cholangiocarcinoma cell lines."}

{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n* Tivozanib inhibited AKT S473 phosphorylation in three cholangiocarcinoma cell lines, WITT, EGI-1, and SNU-1079, (FIG. 3B) and inhibited proliferation of these cells, as shown in the scatter plots of IC50 values in FIGS. 3C- 3E.\n* As shown in the scatter plots of IC50 values in FIGS. 3C- 3E.\n* Treatment with 0.2 pg/mL tivozanib and 1 pg/mL tivozanib resulted in fewer viable cells compared to the control as well statistically significant increased cell degeneration at both dose levels, as well as statistically significant levels of cell death at the higher dose level (FIG. 3J and FIG. 3K).\n\nNote that the last sentence does not explicitly mention a bioactivity metric like IC50, Ki, Kd, or EC50, but it does mention a specific concentration (0.2 pg/mL and 1 pg/mL) and a unit (pg/mL), which could be related to a bioactivity metric. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact bioactivity metric being referred to.\n\nThe first sentence mentions IC50 values, but it does not provide a specific numeric value or unit. The second sentence is similar to the first one, but it's more of a reference to a figure rather than a standalone sentence.\n\nIf you'd like to extract more information or clarify the context, please let me know!"}
