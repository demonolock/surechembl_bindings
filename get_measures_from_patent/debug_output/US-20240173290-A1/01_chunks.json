    "least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80% or at least 90%. In one embodiment, an inhibitor of human TRPM3 reduces CGRP levels by at least as much as a blocking concentration of isosakuranetin ((2S)-5,7-dihydroxy-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2,3-dihydrochromen-4-one).</p>Property 4 is assessed in a suitable model, for example the five-day rat dural infusion migraine model described by Oshinsky et al., supra, using a TRPM3 agonist in place of inflammatory soup. The level of facial allodynia is lower in the presence of an inhibitor of human TRPM3 compared to that observed in the absence of the inhibitor of human TRPM3. In a particular embodiment, the reduction in facial allodynia is measured using von Frey filaments. In particular embodiments, an inhibitor of humant TRPM3 reduces the von Frey threshold on a particular day following infusion by 0.5 g, 1 g, 1.5 g, or 2 g. In certain embodiment, the reduction is measured from day 0 to day 14 post the completion of infusion. In particular embodiments, the reduction is measured on day 0, day 3, day 6, day 9 or day 12.</p>In the assays used to assess these properties, any compound capable of promoting calcium ion influx in a cell line expressing human TRPM3 may be used as the agonist. In one embodiment, the calcium ion influx is mediated by human TRPM3. Typically, the agonist is used at a concentration causing a response between 50% and 80% of the maximal response (i.e. between EC50-EC80) for the assays used to assess properties 1 to 3. In one embodiment, the agonist is pregnenolone sulfate or CIM0216 (racemate of 2-(3,4-dihydroquinolin-1(2H)-yl)-N-(5-methylisoxazol-3-yl)-2-phenylacetamide). Further details of the conduct of these assays are set out in the section entitled \u201cIDENTIFICATION OF INHIBITORS OF HUMAN TRPM3\u201d.</p>The nature of an inhibitor of human TRPM3 is not limited, and could be a chemical compound (i.e. a compound), an oligonucleotide, a peptide, a polypeptide, a protein, an antibody or an alternative antibody format. In one embodiment, the inhibitor of human TRPM3 is a compound.</p>The term \u201cantibody\u201d is used herein in the broadest sense to refer to molecules with an immunoglobulin-like domain (for example IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD or IgE) and includes monoclonal, recombinant, synthetic, polyclonal, chimeric, human, humanised, multispecific antibodies, including bispecific antibodies, and heteroconjugate antibodies; a single variable domain, antigen binding antibody fragments (e.g. Fab, F(ab\u2032)2, Fv, disulphide linked Fv, single chain Fv, disulphide-linked scFv, diabodies, TANDAB\u2122, etc.) and modified versions of any of the foregoing.</p>The term \u201cdomain\u201d refers to a folded protein structure which retains its tertiary structure independent of the rest of the protein. Generally, domains are responsible for discrete functional properties of proteins and in many cases may be added, removed or transferred to other proteins without loss of function",
    "ough selectivity may be required in particular embodiments. For example, in one embodiment, the inhibitor of a mutated version of human TRPM3 having a gain of function mutation is an inhibitor that is selective for the mutated version over the corresponding wild type TRPM3 variant.</p>In one embodiment, the inhibitor of human TRPM3 exhibits selectivity for the TRPM3 having the sequence set out in SEQ ID NO: 2 (or a processed version of SEQ ID NO:2 lacking the initial methionine residue) over other TRPM3 variants. Similarly to the above, the skilled person would understand that selectivity for this isoform can be assessed in binding assays or using a calcium mobilisation assay using channels that are homotetrameric for SEQ ID NO:2 (or a processed version of SEQ ID NO:2 lacking the initial methionine residue) and channels that are homotetrameric for the reference TRPM3 variant.</p>In a further embodiment, the inhibitor of human TRPM3 selectively inhibits the response to a particular stimulus. As explained in the Background, human TRPM3 is polymodally activated. In one embodiment, inhibition is selective to agonism by pregnenolone sulfate over heat. In another embodiment, inhibition is selective to agonism by pregnenolone sulfate over other agonists (e.g., nifedipine, D-erythrosphingosine, CIM2016). A functional assay such as a calcium mobilisation assay may be used to assess selectivity to particular stimuli.</p>In the above embodiments in which selectivity is assessed using a binding assay, the Kd for human TRPM3 channels or channels homotetrameric for a particular isoform of human TRPM3 is at least 10 fold lower compared to the reference channel. In a more particular embodiment, the Kd for the human TRPM3 channels or channels homotetrameric for a particular isoform of human TRPM3 is at least 100 fold lower compared to the reference channel. In embodiments above in which selectivity is assessed using a calcium mobilisation assay, the IC50 or Kd derived therefrom for human TRPM3 channels or channels homotetrameric for a particular isoform of human TRPM3 is at least 10 fold lower compared to the reference channel. In a particular embodiment above in which selectivity is assessed using a calcium mobilisation assay, the IC50 or Kd derived therefrom for human TRPM3 channels or channels homotetrameric for a particular isoform of human TRPM3 is at least 100 fold lower compared to the reference channel.</p>IDENTIFICATION OF INHIBITORS OF HUMAN TRPM3As discussed supra, the properties that define an inhibitor are determined experimentally in assays. These assays can be used to identify additional inhibitors of human TRPM3.</p>Property 1 is measured using a calcium mobilisation assay in which changes in intracellular calcium ion levels are detected by changes in calcium indicator compounds. Currently, over one hundred chemically synthesized and genetically encoded calcium indicators are available.</p>Accordingly, in one aspect, the invention provides a method for identifying an inhibitor of human TRPM3, comprising:\na) contacting a cell line expressing human TRPM3 which cells contain an intracellular calcium indicator with an agonist of human TRPM3 in the presence and absence of a test inhibitor; andb) measuring a change in intracellular calcium concentrations by measuring a change in the intracellular calcium indicator;\n\nwherein the test inhibitor is identified as an inhibitor for human TRPM3 if intracellular calcium concentrations are reduced in the presence of the test inhibitor compared to those achieved in the absence of test inhibitor.\n\n</p>In one embodiment, the intracellular calcium indicator is a synthetic calcium indicator, and step a) is preceded by a step of loading the cells with the indicator."
