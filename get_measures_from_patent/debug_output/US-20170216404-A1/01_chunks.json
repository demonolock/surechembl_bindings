    " insulin, LysB28ProB29-human insulin, and B28Lys, B29Pro human insulin.</p>Compositions of the invention, which in a non-limiting preferred embodiment are isolated or substantially pure, include the combinations of an insulin and an amylin agonist in any of the ratios described or referenced herein, or as may be calculated as described herein.</p>The term \u201camylin agonist\u201d as used herein means an amylin, an amylin analog, an amylin derivative, and other compounds that mimics one or more effects (or activity) of an amylin in vitro or in vivo.</p>\u201cAmylin\u201d as used herein refers to a human peptide hormone of 37 amino acids referred to as amylin, which is co-secreted with insulin from the beta cells of the pancreas. Human amylin has a disulfide bridge between the two Cys residues at positions 2 and 7 and an amide group attached to the C-terminal amino acid residue via a peptide bond. The term also includes variants of amylin as present in, and in isolatable form, other mammalian species, for example, rodent amylin. With respect to a naturally occurring amylin compound, the term includes such a compound in an isolated, purified, or other form that is otherwise not found in nature.</p>An \u201cagonist\u201d of amylin refers to a compound that mimics one or more effects (or activity) of amylin in vitro or in vivo. The effects of amylin include the ability to directly or indirectly interact or bind with one or more receptors that are activated or deactivated by amylin, for example, the receptor binding assay and the soleus muscle assay described in Examples 2 and 3, respectively in WO 2004/037168. Preferred amylin agonists may also be compounds having at least 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or 99% amino acid sequence identity to human amylin and having amylin activity. Exemplary amylin agonists contemplated in the use of the invention include those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,686,411, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,114,304, and 6,410,511, which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>\u201cNon-amylin-based amylin agonists\u201d are non-amylin-based agonists not based on amylin sequences or structures, i.e., compounds other than an amylin, an amylin analog, or an amylin derivative, that also mimics one or more effects (or activity) of amylin in vitro or in vivo. They include a calcitonin, which, as used herein, refers to the human peptide hormone calcitonin and non-human species variations of it, such as that of rat, salmon 10 and eel (including aminosuberic eel calcitonin). \u201cNon-amylin-based amylin agonists\u201d are useful in the inventions described herein.</p>An \u201canalog\u201d or \u201canalogue\u201d or \u201cagonist analog\u201d of amylin refers to a compound that is similar in structure (e.g., derived from the primary amino acid sequence of amylin by substituting one or more natural or unnatural amino acids or peptidomimetics) to amylin and mimics an effect of amylin in vitro or in vivo.</p>The nomenclature of various amylin analogs useful in the present invention can be used to indicate both t"
