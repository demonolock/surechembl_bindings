    "aycomb media (JRH Biosciences #51800) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mM L-glutamine, and 10 \u03bcM norepinephrine, and grown to confluency overnight. The next day, growth medium is aspirated from confluent cell monolayers and replaced with 100 \u03bcL per well Tyrode's solution (in mM: 130 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1.8 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.0 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 HEPES, 10 glucose, pH 7.35) and 50 \u03bcL per well FLIPR Calcium Assay kit, component A (#R-8033, Molecular Devices Corporation) and incubated for 60 min. in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> 37\u00b0 C incubator. 50 \u03bcL per well test compounds are added to the plates and further incubated for 15 min. in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> 37\u00b0 C incubator. All final solutions contain the anion exchange inhibitor, probenecid (2.5 mM). The 96- well plates are then placed in the center position of the FLIPR l(Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader, Molecular Devices Corporation). Cell monolayers in each well are simultaneously illuminated at 488 nm with an Argon ion laser, and fluorescence emission is monitored using a 510-570 nm bandpass filter and a cooled CCD camera. To depolarize the plasma membrane and activate L-type calcium channels, 50\u03bcL per well of 20 mM KCl (final concentration) are dispensed simultaneously to all 96 wells using the FLIPR' s automatic 96-well pipettor. Fluorescence measurements are captured for 5 min. following KCl addition. Calcium influx, expressed as % control, is calculated for each concentration of test compound and concentration-response curves and IC50 values are generated using GraphPad Prism 4.0.</p>\n  KvI.5 Patch Clamp EP</p>\n  [0318] KvI .5 currents are recorded by the whole cell mode of patch clamp electrophysiology.<sup>1</sup> KvI.5 is stably over expressed in either HEK or LTK- cells. Microelectrodes are pulled from borosilicate glass (TW150) and heat polished (tip resistance, 1.5 to 3 megaohms). The external solution is standard Tyrodes solution. The internal (microelectrode) solution contained: 110 mM KCl, 5 mM K^ATP, 5 mM</p>\n  K<sub>4</sub>BAPTA, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 10 mM HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH. Command \n\npotentials are applied for 1 second to +6OmV from a holding potential of -70 mV using Axon software (pClamp 8.1) and hardware (Axopatch ID, 200B). Compounds are prepared as 10-2OmM DMSO stocks and diluted to appropriate test concentrations. After stable currents are achieved, compounds are perfused onto the cells and the cells are pulsed every 5 seconds until no further changes in current are evident at a given compound concentration. Inhibition was measured at the end of the 1 second pulses and expressed relative to controls. Initial KvI.5 inhibition is estimated by single point determinations done at l\u03bcM. Concentration response curves are generated for appropriate compounds utilizing at least four concentrations and an n = 3. Curve fitting and IC<sub>50</sub> estimating are done using Graphpad software (Ver. 4).</p>\n  HERG Patch Clamp EP</p>\n  [0319] HERG currents are recorded by the wh"
