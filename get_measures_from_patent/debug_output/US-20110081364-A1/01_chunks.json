Biological MethodsExample 1AuroraA Inhibition AssayCompounds were screened for their ability to inhibit full length Aurora-A (AA 1-403) activity using a standard coupled enzyme system (Fox et al., Protein Sci., 7, pp. 2249 (1998)). Reactions were carried out in a solution containing 100 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 mM NaCl, 300 \u03bcM NADH, 1 mM DTT and 3% DMSO. Final substrate concentrations in the assay were 200 \u03bcM ATP (Sigma Chemicals, St Louis, Mo.) and 800 \u03bcM peptide (LRRASLG, American Peptide, Sunnyvale, Calif.). Reactions were carried out at 30\u00b0 C. and 35 nM Aurora-A. Final concentrations of the components of the coupled enzyme system were 2.5 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 200 \u03bcM NADH, 60 \u03bcg/ml pyruvate kinase and 20 \u03bcg/ml lactate dehydrogenase.</p>An assay stock buffer solution was prepared containing all of the reagents listed above with the exception of ATP and the test compound of interest. The assay stock buffer solution (60 \u03bcl) was incubated in a 96 well plate with 2 \u03bcl of the test compound of interest at final concentrations spanning 0.002 \u03bcM to 30 \u03bcM at 30\u00b0 C. for 10 min. Typically, a 12 point titration was conducted by preparing serial dilutions (from 1 mM compound stocks) with DMSO of the test compounds in daughter plates. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 \u03bcl of ATP (final concentration 200 \u03bcM). Rates of reaction were obtained using a Molecular Devices Spectramax plate reader (Sunnyvale, Calif.) over 10 min at 30\u00b0 C. The Ki values were determined from the rate data as a function of inhibitor concentration using computerized nonlinear regression (Prism 3.0, Graphpad Software, San Diego, Calif.). Compounds were tested and found to inhibit Aurora A. Compounds I-1 and I-28 were tested and found to inhibit Aurora A with a Ki of less than 200 nM.</p>Example 2Aurora B Inhibition Assay (Radiometric)An assay buffer solution is prepared which consists of 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1% BSA and 10% glycerol. A 22 nM Aurora-B solution, also containing 1.7 mM DTT and 1.5 mM Kemptide (LRRASLG), is prepared in assay buffer. To 22 \u03bcL of the Aurora-B solution, in a 96-well plate, is added 2 \u03bcl of a compound stock solution in DMSO and the mixture is allowed to equilibrate for 10 minutes at 25\u00b0 C. The enzyme reaction is initiated by the addition of 16 \u03bcl stock [\u25a1-<sup>33</sup>P]-ATP solution (\u02dc20 nCi/\u03bcL) prepared in assay buffer, to a final assay concentration of 800 \u03bcM. The reaction is stopped after 3 hours by the addition of 16 \u03bcL 500 mM phosphoric acid and the levels of <sup>33</sup>P incorporation into the peptide substrate is determined by the following method.</p>A phosphocellulose 96-well plate (Millipore, Cat no. MAPHNOB50) is pre-treated with 100 \u03bcL of a 100 mM phosphoric acid prior to the addition of the enzyme reaction mixture (40 \u03bcL). The solution is left to soak on to the phosphocellulose membrane for 30 minutes and the plate subsequently is washed four times with 200 \u03bcL of a 100 mM phosphoric acid. To each well of the dry plate is added 30 \u03bcL of Optiphase \u2018SuperMix\u2019 liquid scintillation cocktail (Perkin Elmer) prior to scintillation counting (1450 Microbeta Liquid Scintillation Counter, Wallac). Levels of non-enzyme catalysed background radioactivity are determined by adding 16 \u03bcl of the 500 mM phosphoric acid to control wells, containing all assay components (which acts to denature the enzyme), prior to the addition of the [\u25a1-<sup>33</sup>P]-ATP solution. Levels of enzyme catalysed <sup>33</sup>P incorporation are calculated by subtracting mean background counts from those measured at each inhibitor concentration. For each Ki determination 8 data points, typically covering the concentration range 0-10 \u03bcM compound, are obtained in duplicate (DMSO stocks are prepared from an initial compound stock of 10 mM with subsequent 1:2.5 serial dilutions). Ki values are calculated from initial rate data by non-linear regression using the Prism software package (Prism 3.0, Graphpad Software, San Diego, Calif.).</p>"
