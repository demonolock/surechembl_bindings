Towards this end, Applicants synthesized a biotin-conjugate of BRD7087 (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>59</b></figref>) and loaded this compound on the streptavidin sensors of BLI. The compound loaded sensors were allowed to interact with SpCas9:gRNA complex generating the response curves (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>36</b>B</figref>). A 2:1 compound to Cas9 binding isotherm indicated a dissociation constant of \u02dc160 nM (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. <b>60</b>A-<b>60</b>B</figref>). In a competitive experiment performed in the presence of excess (10\u00d7) of biotin to BRD7087 loading, Applicants observed no substantial response signal upon incubation with the SpCas9:gRNA solution, confirming the specific nature of BRD7087 and SpCas9:gRNA interaction (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIGS. <b>61</b>-<b>63</b></figref>). Furthermore, the BRD7087 has a fluorine moiety which allowed us to investigate the interaction of compound and SpCas9:gRNA by <sup>19</sup>F NMR. Binding of BRD7087 was confirmed using differential line broadening of <sup>19</sup>F signal upon titration of SpCas9:gRNA; the signal corresponding to 50 \u03bcM ligand broadens in a dose-dependent manner as expected (Table 7). While small amounts of protein showed a negligible effect, significant broadening is observed with SpCas9:gRNA concentrations as low as 0.75 \u03bcM (67-fold excess of ligand), indicating relatively tight binding. Using peak intensities obtained by fitting for these datapoints, the method of Shortridge et. al. indicates a binding constant K<sub>d </sub>\u02dc2.2 \u03bcM (Shortridge, M. D.; Hage, D. S.; Harbison, G. S.; Powers, R., Estimating protein-ligand binding affinity using high-throughput screening by NMR. <i>J Comb Chem </i>2008, 10 (6), 948-58). Allowing for the inclusion of a nonspecific binding term does not alter the binding constant value but slightly improves the fit (<figref idrefs=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. <b>64</b></figref>).</p><p id=\"p-0581\" num=\"0715\">Table 8: Table containing data that was used to estimate the ligand binding affinity based on the method described by Shortridge et. al. The linewidth (LW) increases with increasing protein concentration, as expected. Peak intensity values were used to measure the Fractional Occupancy using the relationship given in the paper (1\u2212I<sub>bound</sub>/I<sub>0</sub>), where I<sub>0 </sub>is the intensity of the peak with no protein in the sample. The peak area remains relatively constant, as expected for a fixed concentration of ligand. The value of K<sub>d </sub>was estimated by nonlinear least-squares fitting of expression from the reference.</p><p id=\"p-0582\" num=\"0716\"><tables id=\"TABLE-US-00017\" num=\"00017\"><table frame=\"none\" colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\" pgwide=\"1\"><tgroup align=\"left\" colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\" cols=\"1\"><colspec colname=\"1\" colwidth=\"259pt\" align=\"center\"/><thead><row><entry namest=\"1\" nameend=\"1\" rowsep=\"1\">TABLE 8</entry></row></thead><tbody valign=\"top\"><row><entry namest=\"1\" nameend=\"1\" align=\"center\" rowsep=\"1\"/></row><row><entry>RAW DATA EXTRACTED FROM SPECTRA</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align=\"left\" colsep=\"0\" rowsep=\"0\" cols=\"6\"><colspec colname=\"1\" colwidth=\"42pt\" align=\"center\"/><colspec colname=\"2\" colwidth=\"63pt\" align=\"center\"/><colspec colname=\"3\" colwidth=\"28pt\" align=\"center\"/><colspec colname=\"4\" colwidth=\"35pt"
