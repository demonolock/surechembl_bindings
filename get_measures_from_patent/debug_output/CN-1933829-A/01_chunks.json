    "ace part and itself also can be substituted in due course by those skilled in the art.</p>Term \" cycloalkyl \" refers to the saturated cyclic hydrocarbon loop systems of any replacement, and preferred every ring contains 3 to 7 carbon.Typical group comprises cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopenta, cyclohexyl, suberyl, ring octyl group, ring decyl, cyclo-dodecyl and adamantyl.Typical substituent group comprises one or more abovementioned alkyl group, or one or more above-mentioned group as alkyl substituent.</p>Term \" effective dose \" meaning is the amount of the effect that will draw cell, tissue, system, health, animal, individual, patient or human biological, physiological, pharmacological, therapeutic or medical science of test-compound, these are observed by research worker, pharmacologist, pharmacists, veterinary, the doctor of medicine or other clinicians, for example: alleviate hyperplasia disorderly as cancer or tumor influence/symptom or kill proliferative cell such as tumor cell or suppress its growth.</p>Term \" further treatment \", \" further administration \" or \" further by administration \", the meaning be different medicines can be simultaneously, selectively or administration intermittently.Further administration like this can be spaced in time or on the space, for example in the different time, on the different dates or through different mode of administration or approach.</p>Term \" halogen \" or \" halogen \" refer to fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine.</p>Term \" IC50 \", as be used for herein refers to the concentration of measurable phenotype or response, as cell for example the growth of tumor cell be suppressed 50% concentration.The IC50 value can estimate from proper dosage-response curve, for example by fitting by eye or use suitable curve fitting or statistical software.More accurately, the IC50 value can be determined by using nonlinear regression analysis.</p>As be used for herein, \" individuality \" refers to cellulous organism, for example animal such as mammal, preferably primate.Except primates for example the mankind, other many kinds of mammals also can be treated according to method of the present invention.For example, spendable mammal includes but not limited to: cattle, sheep, goat, horse, Canis familiaris L., cat, Cavia porcellus, rat or other Bovidaes, sheep section, equine, Canidae, cat family, Rodents or murine.</p>Term \" metabolite \", as be used for herein, refer to any material that produces by metabolism or metabolic process.Metabolism, as be used for herein, be meant the various physics relevant with being present in cell, tissue, system, health, animal, individual, patient or human molecule or conversion of compounds/chemistry/biochemical/pharmacological reaction.</p>Term \" prodrug \", as be used for herein, refer to be converted in vivo the reagent of the active parent drug on the pharmacology.Prodrug is normally useful, because in some cases, they are easy to administration than parent drug.For example, they can be by oral administration by biological utilisation and parent drug can not sometimes.In pharmaceutical composition, prodrug can also improve dissolubility than parent drug.Prodrug can be converted into parent drug by various mechanism, comprises enzymatic processes and metabolism hydrolysis.See people such as Gangwar \" Prodrug; mole",
    "nd degree; The kind of concurrent treatment, the frequency of treatment and desired effects.</p>The toxicity of pharmaceutical composition of the present invention and therapeutic efficacy can determine by the pharmacy step of the standard in cell culture or laboratory animal, for example: determine LD50 (median lethal dose(LD 50)) and ED50 (median effective dose).Dose ratio between toxicity and therapeutic effect is a therapeutic index, and the ratio of available LD50/ED50 is represented.The medicine that shows high therapeutic index is preferred.And the therapeutic combination that shows toxic and side effects can be used, but should note designing delivery system, takes such medicine to the affected target position of organizing, so that the latent lesion of the cell that do not infect is minimized, thereby reduce side effect.</p>The data that obtain from cell culture assays and zooscopy can be used for setting forth and are used for human dosage range.This dosage is preferably located in circulation composition (circulating concentrations) scope with hypotoxicity or the avirulent ED50 of comprising.Dosage can change in this scope according to the dosage form of using and the route of administration of application.For the medicine of any use method of the present invention, its treatment effective dose can be estimated from cell culture assays at first.Determined as cell culture, dosage can obtain comprising in animal model in the circulating plasma concentration range of IC50 (that is: the medicine of test reaches the concentration of a maximum half that suppresses to symptom or biochemical active inhibition) and form.These information can be used for the more accurate human dosage that is identified for.Can measure blood plasma level, for example: pass through high performance liquid chromatography.</p>The suitable dose that is understood that medicine depends on those of ordinary skills, as: doctor, many factors of being known.Micromolecular dosage for example will depend on: identity, size and the condition of the experimenter or the sample for the treatment of, the route of administration that further depends on said composition, if can use, the doctor expects that this treatment (medicine) has effect by the disease mediated cause of target (nucleic acid for example of the present invention or polypeptide), symptom or effect to the treatment target so.</p>Typical dosage comprise every kilogram tried or example weight in micromolecular milligram or microgram amount, for example: every kilogram to about 500 milligrams every kilogram of about 1 microgram, every kilogram to about 50 milligrams every kilogram of about 100 microgram, or about 1 milligram every kilogram to about 5 milligrams every kilogram.It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that also and can on the basis of body surface area, measure dosage.One 70 kilograms people has about 1.8 square metres body surface area, dosage comprises the amount of micromolecular milligr"
