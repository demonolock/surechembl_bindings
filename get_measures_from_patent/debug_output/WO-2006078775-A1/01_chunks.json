Following are typical procedures for preparing various compounds; other procedures may also be applicable and the procedures may be modified to prepare other compounds within the scope of Formula I. One skilled in the art will recognize that one route will be optimal depending on the choice of appendage substituents. Additionally, one skilled in the art will recognize that in some cases the order of steps has to be controlled to avoid functional group incompatibilities.</p>\n  Unless otherwise stated, the following abbreviations have the stated meanings in the reactions schemes and examples below: Me=methyl; Et=ethyl; Bu=butyl; Pr=propyl; Ph=phenyl; t-BOC=tert-butoxycarbonyl; and Ac=acetyl</p>\n  DEC= 1 -(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride DIPEA= diisopropylethylamine DMF= dimethylformamide \n\nDMSO= dimethylsulfoxide</p>\n  HOBT= 1 -hydroxybenzotriazole</p>\n  RT= room temperature</p>\n  TFA= trifluoroacetic acid</p>\n  THF= tetrahydrofuran</p>\n  TLC= thin layer chromatography</p>\n  HRMS= High Resolution Mass Spectrometry</p>\n  LRMS= Low Resolution Mass Spectrometry nM= nanomolar</p>\n  Ki= Dissociation Constant for substrate/receptor complex pA2= -logEC<sub>\u03b4</sub>o, as defined by J.

The animals weighed 400-600 g. The brain tissue was homogenized with a solution of 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5. The final concentration of tissue in the homogenization buffer was 10% w/v. The homogenates were centrifuged at 1 ,000 x g for 10 min. in order to remove clumps of tissue and debris. The resulting supematants were then centrifuged at 50,000 x g for 20 min. in order to sediment the membranes, which were next washed three times in homogenization buffer (50,000 x g for 20 min. each). The membranes were frozen and stored at -70<sup>0</sup>C until needed.</p>\n  All compounds to be tested were dissolved in DMSO and then diluted into the binding buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5) such that the final concentration was 2 \u03bcg/ml with 0.1% DMSO. Membranes were then added (400 \u03bcg of protein) to the reaction tubes. \n\nThe reaction was started by the addition of 3 nM [<sup>3</sup>H]R-\u03b1-methyl histamine (8.8</p>\n  Ci/mmol) or 3 nM [<sup>3</sup>H]N<sup>\u03b1</sup>-methyl histamine (80 Ci/mmol) and continued under incubation at 3O<sup>0</sup>C for 30 min. Bound ligand was separated from unbound ligand by filtration, and the amount of radioactive ligand bound to the membranes was quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry. All incubations were performed in duplicate and the standard error was always less than 10%. Compounds that inhibited more than 70% of the specific binding of radioactive ligand to the receptor were serially diluted to determine a Kj (nM).</p>\n  Compounds of formula I have a Kj within the range of about 1 to about 1000 nM. Preferred compounds of formula I have a K,- within the range of about 1 to about 100 nM. More preferred compounds of formula I have a K,- within the range of about 1 to about 10 nM. The compound of Example 1 EE has a Ki of 1 nM.</p>\n  In this specification, the term \"at least one compound of formula I\" means that one to three different compounds of formula I may be used in a pharmaceutical composition or method of treatment. Preferably one compound of formula I is used. Similarly, \"at least one Hi receptor antagonist\" means that one to three different Hi antagonists may be used in a pharmaceutical composition or method of treatment. Preferably, one Hi antagonist is used.</p>\n  For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds described by this invention, inert, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, dispersible granules, capsules, cachets and suppositories. The powders and tablets may be comprised of from about 5 to about 95 percent active ingredient. Suitable solid carriers are known in the art, e.g. magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar or lactose. Tablets, powders, cachets and capsules can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration.
