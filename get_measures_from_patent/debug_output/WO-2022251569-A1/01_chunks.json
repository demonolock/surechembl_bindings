In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is for intranasal or intravenous administration. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is for use in a method of treating DRE in a subject. In some embodiments, the ketamine is formulated with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. In some embodiments, the ketamine is formulated as a solution or suspension. In some embodiments, the carrier or diluent is aqueous. In some embodiments, the carrier or diluent comprises sterile phosphate buffered saline solution, bacteriostatic water, aqueous glycine, or any combination thereof. </p>Ketamine ((2-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(methylamino)-cyclohexanone) is a general anesthetic used by anesthesiologists, veterinarians, and researchers. Pharmacologically, ketamine is a noncompetitive NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonist. More specifically, ketamine binds to the allosteric site of the NMDA receptor, effectively inhibiting its channel. At high, fully anesthetic level doses, ketamine has also been found to bind to m-opioid receptors type 2 in cultured human neuroblastoma cells - however, without agonist activity - and to sigma receptors in rats. Also, ketamine interacts with muscarinic receptors, descending monoaminergic pain pathways and voltage-gated calcium channels. \n\n Ketamine is a chiral compound. The S(+) and R(-) stereoisomers bind NMDA receptors with different affinities: Ki = 3200 and 1100 nM, respectively. Vranken et al. studied the use of an iontophoretic patch (a mechanism of delivery in which the electrically charged drug is transmitted by pulses of galvanic current) in 33 men and women in an investigation that studied the use of an iontophoretic patch to deliver ketamine for the treatment of intractable central neuropathic pain. S(+)-ketamine (also referred to as \u201c(S)- ketamine\u201d or \u201cesketamine\u201d) was found to be two times more potent than racemic mixture of ketamine. Most pharmaceutical preparations of ketamine are racemic; however, some brands reportedly have (mostly undocumented) differences in enantiomeric proportions. The more active (S)-ketamine enantiomer is available for medical use under the brand name Ketanest S. Its hydrochloride salt is sold as Ketanest, Ketaset, and Ketalar. See, Paul et al., \"Comparison of racemic ketamine and S-ketamine in treatment-resistant major depression: report of two cases\", World J. of Bio. Psych., 2009, pp 241 -244, Vol. 10(3) describe two cases studies in which patients with a history of recurrent major depression were treated with intravenous infusion of ketamine and S-ketamine; Paskalis et al., \"Oral Administration of the NMDA Receptor Antagonist S-Ketamine as Add-on Therapy of Depression: A Case Series\", Pharmacopsychiatry, 2010, pp 33-35, Vol. 40 present four case studies where depressed patients received 1.25 mg/kg oral S-ketamine as add-on to standard antidepressant therapy; Noppers et al., \""
