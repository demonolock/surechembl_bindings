    "ions, also called CDRs. The extent of the framework region and CDRs have been precisely defined (see, for example, Kabat et al, \"Sequences of Proteins of 7mmunological 7nterest\", U.S. Department of Health and Human Sciences, 1983). The sequences of the framework regions of different light or heavy chains are relatively conserved within a species. As used herein, a \"human framework region\" is a framework region that is substantially identical (about 85% or more, usually 90-95% or more) to the framework region of a naturally occurring human immunoglobulin. The framework region of an antibody, that is the combined framework regions of the constituent light and heavy chains, serves to position and align the CDRs. The CDRs are primarily responsible for binding to an epitope of LEVI kinase.</p>As used herein, the term \"heavy chain variable region\" means a polypeptide wliich is from about 110 to 125 amino acid residues in length, the amino acid sequence of which corresponds to that of a heavy chain of a monoclonal antibody of the invention, starting from the amino-terminal (N-terminal) amino acid residue of the heavy chain. Likewise, the term \"light chain variable region\" means a polypeptide which is from about 95 to 130 amino acid residues in length, the amino acid sequence of which corresponds to that of a \n\nlight chain of a monoclonal antibody of the invention, starting from the N-terminal amino acid residue of the light chain. Full-length immunoglobulin \"light chains\" (about 25 Kd or 214 amino acids) are encoded by a variable region gene at the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminus (about 110 amino acids) and a K or \u03bb constant region gene at the COOH-terminus. Full-length immunoglobulin \"heavy chains\" (about 50 Kd or 446 amino acids), are similarly encoded by a variable region gene (about 116 amino acids) and one of the other aforementioned constant region genes, e.g. \u03b3 (encoding about 330 amino acids).</p>The term \"immunoglobulin\" or \"antibody\" is used herein to refer to a protein consisting of one or more polypeptides substantially encoded by immunoglobulin genes. The recognized immunoglobulin genes include the . \u03bb, . \u03b3 (IgG<sub>l5</sub> IgG<sub>2</sub>, IgG<sub>3</sub>, IgG<sub>4</sub>), \u03b4. \u03b5 and \u03bc constant region genes, as well as the myriad immunoglobulin variable region genes. One form of immunoglobulin constitutes the basic structural unit of an antibody. This form is a tetramer and consists of two identical pairs of immunoglobulin chains, each pair having one light and one heavy chain, hi each pair, the light and heavy chain variable regions are together responsible for binding to an antigen, and the constant regions are responsible for the antibody effector functions. In addition to antibodies, immunoglobulins may exist in a variety of other forms including, for example, Fv, Fab, Fab' and (Fab') .</p>The invention also contemplates the use and generation of fragments of monoclonal antibodies produced by the method of the present invention including, for example, Fv, Fab, Fab' and F(ab')<sub>2</sub> fragments. Such fragments may be prepared by standard methods as for example described by Coligan et al. (1991-1997, supra).</p>The present invention also contemplates synthetic "
