{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences/rows that meet the criteria:\n\n\nKD value could not be calculated for 5A7 precisely as it was difficult to dissociate from HA (Table 5).\n\n\nNote that there is only one sentence that mentions a molecule (5A7), a bioactivity metric (KD), but it does not provide a specific numeric value or unit. However, I extracted it as it provides some context and mentions a table (Table 5) that might contain the relevant information.\n\n\nAfter re-examining the text, I found that Table 5 is mentioned, but its contents are not provided in the text snippet. If you have access to the table, it might contain the relevant information."}
