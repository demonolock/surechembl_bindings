    "da expression vectors using Lipofectamine2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen).  Transfected cells were incubated in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37deg C in DMEM with 1 mcg/ml of puromycin and 100 mcg/ml of hygromycin for 3 weeks.  Cells were then replated to 15-cm dishes (Corning) and incubated, and colonies were picked and cultured as putative cell lines stably expressing IgG.  The transformants at 90% confluence on 15-cm dishes had the medium changed to serum-free Nutrient Mixture F-12 Ham's (Sigma), cells were then cultured in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37deg C for 1 week.  Recombinant IgGs were purified from culture medium using HiTrap Protein G HP Columns.  The purified IgGs were dialyzed against PBS and then concentrated using an Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA).  In vitro viral neutralization tests were performed using purified 5A7/CHO-K1, and neutralizing activity was found against both the viral strains examined (B/Florida/4/2006 and B/Malaysia/2506/2004).  Notably, the neutralizing activity of 5A7/CHO-K1 was similar to that of 5A7 produced by the hybridoma (FIG. 10).\n\n</p>\nHuMabs 5A7, 3A2 and 10C4 were subjected to surface plasmon resonance analysis to examine their binding affinities.  Each HuMab was immobilized on the surface of the sensor chip.  The vaccine antigen, Ha protein of B/Florida/4/2006, at concentrations 12.5, 25, 50, 100 and 200 nM was consecutively injected on the chip surface and the association and dissociation phases were monitored. KD value could not be calculated for 5A7 precisely as it was difficult to dissociate from HA (Table 5).\n\n</p>Table5<img id=\"\" path=\"JPOXMLDOC01-appb-I000005.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/242892728/WO/20130808/A1/002013/11/48/85/JPOXMLDOC01-appb-I000005.tif\"/></p>\nSequences of the V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> region of the three HuMAbs were compared and analyzed to the closest germline sequences using IgBlast software in NCBI database.  These three HuMAbs were derived from different germ lines except D region V<sub>H</sub> of 3A2 and 10C4(Fig. 11-13).\n\n</p>\nReferences\nAoki et al., \"Early Administration of Oral Oseltamivir Increases the Benefits of Influenza Treatment.
