For large-scale production of membranes, cells were grown in 100 L suspension culture to 1.0E8 cells/mL then harvested using the Viafuge at continuous centrifugation of 1000 g. For pilot studies, cells were grown in 2 L spinner culture and harvested by centrifugation (1900 g, 10 min, 4\u00b0 C.). The cell pellet was washed with PBS, centrifuged (1900 g, 10 min, 4\u00b0 C.), then the cells resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10% (w/v) sucrose, Complete Protease Inhibitor tablets (EDTA-free)) to a density of 14% w/v for passage through a microfluidizer (Microfluidics 110S, 3 passes, 6,000 psi). The resulting cell lysate was centrifuged (1900 g, 10 min, 4\u00b0 C.), and the crude particulate fraction isolated by centrifugation (142,000 g, 1 h, 4\u00b0 C.) of the low-speed supernatant. The resulting pellet was resuspended in \u2153 the original lysis buffer volume, homogenized, and recentrifuged as above. The membrane pellet was resuspended by homogenization in storage buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10% (w/v) sucrose and Complete Protease Inhibitor tablets (EDTA-free)). Single-use aliquots were made and flash-frozen in liquid N<sub>2 </sub>prior to storage at \u221280\u00b0 C.</p>Membranes containing human bradykinin B2 receptor were purchased from Receptor Biology (now Perkin Elmer Life Sciences). They were derived from a CHO-K1 line stably expressing the human B2 receptor developed by Receptor Biology and subsequently purchased by Amgen. For some studies, membranes were prepared in-house from this same cell line using the method described for human B1 receptor membranes, except cells were grown in roller bottles and harvested using Cellmate.</p>Step 2 Human B1 receptor binding assay was performed in 96-well polypropylene plates (Costar 3365) by adding 50 \u03bcl [<sup>3</sup>H]des-arg<sup>10 </sup>kallidin (NET1064; Perkin Elmer Life Sciences) to 10 \u03bcL test compound diluted in 90 \u03bcL assay buffer (24 mM TES, pH 6.8, 1 mM 1,10 o-phenanthroline, 0.3% BSA, 0.5 mM Pefabloc SC, 2 \u03bcg/mL aprotinin, 5 \u03bcg/mL leupeptin, and 0.7 \u03bcg/mL pepstatin A). Membranes (50 \u03bcL) were added last. [<sup>3</sup>H] des-arg<sup>10 </sup>kallidin was diluted from stock into assay buffer to yield a final concentration of \u02dc0.3 nM in the assay but was adjusted as, needed to ensure a concentration at or below the K<sub>d </sub>determined for each batch of receptor membranes. Nonspecific binding was defined with 2 \u03bcM des-Arg<sup>10</sup>Leu<sup>9 </sup>kallidin. Membranes were diluted in assay buffer to yield a final concentration of 0.068 nM hB1 receptor in the assay. Compounds were solubilized in either DMSO or ddH<sub>2</sub>0, plated into polypropylene plates (Costar 3365), then serially diluted in either DMSO or dilution buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, 0.1% BSA) to yield a final concentration of either 5% DMSO or no DMSO in the assay. The assay reaction mixture was incubated with shaking for 1 h at RT and then filtered through GF/C plates presoaked in 0.5% polyethyleneimine (Unifilter; Perkin Elmer Life Sciences) using a Filtermate 96-well harvester (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences). Filter plates were rapidly washed 6 times with 200 \u03bcL ice-cold buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4), dried in "
