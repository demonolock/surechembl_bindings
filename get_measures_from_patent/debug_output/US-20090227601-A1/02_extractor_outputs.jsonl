{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nMembranes were prepared from CHO-d-AQN cells stably transfected with human bradykinin B1 receptor cDNA, and the Kd determined for each batch of receptor membranes was used to adjust the concentration of [<sup>3</sup>H] des-arg<sup>10 </sup>kallidin to yield a final concentration of \u02dc0.3 nM in the assay.\n\n\nNonspecific binding was defined with 2 \u03bcM des-Arg<sup>10</sup>Leu<sup>9 </sup>kallidin.\n\n\nNote that there are limited relevant sentences in the provided text snippet. If you provide more text, I can extract more relevant sentences."}
