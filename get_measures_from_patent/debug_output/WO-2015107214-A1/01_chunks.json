    " of the heavy chain, and each amino group of the lysyl residue has covalently linked to it a methoxypoly(ethyleneglycol) residue having a molecular weight of about 20,000 Da. The total molecular weight of the PEG attached to the antibody is therefore approximately 40,000 Da. </p> In another embodiment, the functional moiety is PEG and is attached to a F(ab)2 fragment using the methods described in WO 98/25971 and WO 04/0721 16, whereby a lysyl-dimaleimide group is attached to the cysteine residue at the C-terminal end of each Fab heavy chain, and each amino group of the lysyl residue has covalently linked to it a methoxypoly(ethyleneglycol) residue having a molecular weight of about 20,000 Da. The total molecular weight of the PEG attached to the F(ab)2 antibody is therefore approximately 40,000 Da. </p> In certain embodiments of this invention, the antibody of this invention is a Fab' antibody fragment, which may be fully human or humanized, and is PEGylated either in the heavy chain, the light chain or both. In other embodiments, the antibody fragment, which may be fully human or humanized, is PEGylated on one or both heavy chains, or on one or both light chains, or on both heavy and light chains. </p> Accordingly, in certain embodiments, an antibody is a PEG-linked antibody (e.g., a PEG-linked human antibody) wherein the PEG is linked to the antibody at a cysteine or at a lysine residue. In certain embodiments, the PEGylated antibody has a hydrodynamic size of at least 24 kD. In other embodiments, the PEG may vary in size from anywhere from 20 to 60 kD (inclusive). In further embodiments, the PEG-linked antibody has a hydrodynamic size of at least 200 kD. In embodiments of the present invention where the antibody is linked to a PEG moiety, the PEGylated antibody may have an increased in vivo half-life relative to an antibody that lacks the PEG moiety. \n\n The term \"pegylation,\" \"polyethylene glycol\" or \"PEG\" includes a polyalkylene glycol compound or a derivative thereof, with or without coupling agents or derivatization with coupling or activating moieties (e.g., with thiol, triflate, tresylate, azirdine, oxirane, or preferably with a maleimide moiety, e.g., PEG-maleimide). Other appropriate polyalkylene glycol compounds include, but are not limited to, maleimido monomethoxy PEG, activated PEG polypropylene glycol, but also charged or neutral polymers of the following types: dextran, colominic acids, or other carbohydrate based polymers, polymers of amino acids, and biotin and other affinity reagent derivatives. </p> Other functional moieties that may be useful in improving the integrity and longevity of the antibodies of the present invention in vivo include polypeptides. For example, the antibodies or antibody fragments of this invention may be modified to include a human serum albumin (HSA) polypeptide. Such an antibody conjugate may exhibit increased stabilization and increased serum half-life compared to a non-conjugated antibody or antigen-binding fragment. For example, in certain embodiments, an antibody conjugated to HSA may exhibit increased in vivo half-life relative to a non-conjugated antibody. The half-life (t"
