    "producing antibody hybridoma, the testing producing antibody hybridoma is to identify the hybridoma that produces with the bonded monoclonal antibody of antigenic specificity.In case obtain said hybridoma, just can hybridoma be bred in cell culture, choose propagation under the condition of culture of generation of hybridoma derived cell and the bonded monoclonal antibody of antigenic specificity wantonly.Can from cell culture, be purified into monoclonal antibody.</p>As the common sense of this area; Be used to mention antibody adjective \" with ... specific reaction \" mean antibody and between target antigen (for example ActRIIb polypeptide) and other non-target antigen, enough selectivitys arranged, make said antibody be used in the situation that exists that detects target antigen in the specific biological sample type at least.Use in the method for antibody at some, for example treatment is used, and in combination, possibly need the specificity of higher degree.Monoclonal antibody have usually effective district office need antigen and cross reaction polypeptide than main trend (comparing) with polyclonal antibody.Influence antibody: a specific characteristic of AI is that antibody is to antigenic affinity.Though can in different affinity scopes, reach required specificity, preferred antibodies generally has about 10\n        \n        <sup>-6</sup>, 10\n        \n        <sup>-7</sup>, 10\n        \n        <sup>-8</sup>, 10\n        \n        <sup>-9</sup>M or lower affinity (dissociation constant).\n      \n      </p>In addition, be used to screen antibody can influence gained antibody with the technology of identifying required antibody character.For example, if antibody is used to conjugated antigen in solution, then possibly need test solution to combine.Can obtain to be used to measure the various different technologies that interact between antibody and the antigen with the antibody of identifying special needs.This type technology comprises ELISA, surperficial plasmon resonance binding assay (Biacore for example\n        \n        <sup>TM</sup>Binding assay, Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden), sandwich assay (paramagnetic beads system for example, IGEN International, Inc., Gaithersburg, Maryland), Western blotting, immunoprecipitation assay and immunohistochemical method.\n      \n      </p>Instance as the nucleic acid compound classification of ActRIIb antagonist comprises antisensenucleic acids, RNAi construct and catalytic nucleic acid construct.Nucleic acid compound can be strand or two strands.Double chain compound can comprise that also its medium-chain one or another are the outstanding petiolarea or the incomplementarity district of strand.Single chain compound can comprise the complementary district of oneself, means what is called \" hair clip \" or \" stem-ring \" structure that compound formation has the double-spiral structure district.Nucleic acid compound can comprise following nucleotide sequence, its with by being no more than total length ActRIIb nucleotide sequence or activin \u03b2\n        \n        <sub>A</sub>, \u03b2\n        \n        <sub>B</sub>, \u03b2\n        \n        <sub>C</sub>Or \u03b2\n        \n        <sub>E</sub>1000 of nucleotide sequence, be no more than 500, be no more than 250, be no more than 100 or be no more than 50,35,25,22,20,18 or 15 regional complementarities that nucleotide is formed.Complementary district is preferably at least 8 nucleotide, optional about 18-35 nucleotide.Complementary district can fall into intron, coded sequence or the non-coding sequence of target transcript, for example coded seque",
    "o-hybrid system (reverse two hybrid system) to identify disassociation ActRIIb polypeptide and its interactional chemical compound of conjugated protein (for example micromolecule or peptide).Referring to for example Vidal and Legrain, (1999) Nucleic Acids Res 27:919-29; Vidal and Legrain, (1999) Trends Biotechnol 17:374-81; And U.S. Patent number 5,525,490,5,955,280 and 5,965,368.</p>In certain embodiments, identify motif compound through itself and ACTRIIb of the present invention or the interactional ability of activin polypeptide.Interaction between chemical compound and ACTRIIb or activin polypeptide can be covalency or non-covalent.For example, can adopt external biochemical method on protein level, to identify this type interaction, comprise that photocrosslinking, labelled with radioisotope part combine and affinity chromatography (Jakoby WB etc., 1974, Methods in Enzymology 46:1).In some cases, can SCREENED COMPOUND in based on the algoscopy of mechanism, the for example algoscopy of detection and activin or the bonded chemical compound of ActRIIb polypeptide.This can comprise solid phase or liquid phase binding events.Perhaps; Can be with the gene of coding activin or ActRIIb polypeptide and report system (for example beta galactosidase, luciferase or green fluorescent protein) transfection to cell, preferably be directed against through high flux screening that the library is screened or screen with each member in library.Can adopt based on other machine-processed binding assay, for example detect the binding assay of Gibbs free.Binding assay can be with being fixed in hole, beadlet or chip or being immobilized antibody capture or being undertaken by the target of capillary electrophoresis separation.Generally can adopt the resonance of colorimetry or fluorescence method or surperficial plasmon to detect bonded chemical compound.</p>In some aspects, the present invention is provided for regulating (stimulating or inhibition) bone formation and the method and the material that increase bone mass.Therefore, can in external or body, in intact cell or tissue, measure any chemical compound of being identified, regulate the ability of bone or cartilage-derived growth to confirm it.The whole bag of tricks known in the art can be used for this purpose.</p>For example; Can be in algoscopy based on cell, through measure Msx2 induce or osteoprogenitor cell is divided into osteoblast, measure ActRIIb or activin polypeptide or test compound to the effect of bone or cartilage-derived growth (referring to for example Daluiski etc.; Nat Genet.2001,27 (1): 84-8; Hino etc., Front Biosci.2004,9:1520-9).Comprise the osteogenic activity of analyzing theme ActRIIb in mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells and the osteoblast or activin polypeptide and test compound based on another instance of the algoscopy of cell.For instance, but the recombinant adenovirus of construction expression activin or ActRIIb polypeptide to infect multipotency mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells C3H10T1/2 cell, preosteoblast C2C12 cell and osteoblast "
