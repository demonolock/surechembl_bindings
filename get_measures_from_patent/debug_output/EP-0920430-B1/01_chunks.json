Two types of mechanism-based inhibitors\nare known, reversible and irreversible, which are distinguished by ease of hydrolysis of the\nenzyme-inhibitor link (Thrombosis Res (1992), Vol. 67, pp. 221-231; and Trends Pharmacol. Sci.\n(1987), Vol. 8, pp. 303-307). A series of guanidino compounds are examples of tight-binding\ninhibitors (Thrombosis Res. (1980), Vol. 19, pp. 339-349). Arylsulfonyl-arginine-piperidine-carboxylic\nacid derivatives have also been shown to be tight-binding inhibitors of thrombin\n(Biochem. (1984), Vol. 23, pp. 85-90), as well as a series of arylamidine-containing compounds,\nincluding 3-amidinophenylaryl derivatives (Thrombosis Res. (1983), Vol. 29, pp. 635-642) and\nbis(amidino)benzyl cycloketones (Thrombosis Res (1980), Vol. 17, pp. 545-548). However,\nthese compounds demonstrate poor selectivity for factor Xa.</p>\n  \n    Related Disclosures\n  \n  European Published Patent Application 0 540 051 (Nagahara et al.) describes aromatic\namidine derivatives which are stated to be capable of showing a strong anticoagulant effect\nthrough reversible inhibition of factor Xa.</p>\n  The synthesis of \u03b1,\u03b1'-bis(amidinobenzylidene)cycloalkanones and \u03b1,\u03b1'-bis(amidinobenzyl)cycloalkanones\nis described in Pharmazie (1977), Vol. 32, No. 3, pp. 141-145. These\ncompounds are disclosed as being serine protease inhibitors.</p>\n  \n    SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n  \n  This invention is directed to compounds or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts which\ninhibit human factor Xa and are therefore useful as pharmacological agents for the treatment of\ndisease-states characterized by thrombotic activity.</p>\n  Accordingly, in one aspect, this invention provides compounds selected from the group\nconsisting of the following formulae: \n<img id=\"img-00030001\" path=\"00030001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/6932961/EP/20030924/B1/000000/92/04/30/00030001.tif\"/>\n<img id=\"img-00030002\" path=\"00030002.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/6932975/EP/20030924/B1/000000/92/04/30/00030002.tif\"/>\n<img id=\"img-00030003\" path=\"00030003.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/6932962/EP/20030924/B1/000000/92/04/30/00030003.tif\"/>\n<img id=\"img-00030004\" path=\"00030004.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/6932971/EP/20030924/B1/000000/92/04/30/00030004.tif\"/>\nwherein:\nZ<sup>1</sup> and Z<sup>2</sup> are independently -O- or -OCH<sub>2</sub>-;R<sup>1</sup> and R<sup>4</sup> are each independently hydrogen, halo or -OR<sup>10</sup>;R<sup>2</sup> is -C(NH)NH<sub>2</sub>, -C(NH)N(H)S(O)<sub",
    "arin is currently used, such as for DVT or other types of\nsurgical intervention such as coronary artery bypass graft and percutaneous transluminal coronary\nangioplasty. The compounds are also useful for the treatment of thrombotic complications\nassociated with acute promyelocytic leukemia, diabetes, multiple myelomas, disseminated\nintravascular coagulation associated with septic shock, purpura fulminanas associated infection,\nadult respiratory distress syndrome, unstable angina, and thrombotic complications associated\nwith aortic valve or vascular prosthesis. The compounds are also useful for prophylaxis for\nthrombotic diseases, in particular in patients who have a high risk of developing such disease.</p>\n  In addition, the compounds of the invention are useful as in vitro diagnostic reagents for\nselectively inhibiting factor Xa without inhibiting other components of the coagulation cascade.</p>\n  \n    B. Testing\n  \n  The primary bioassays used to demonstrate the inhibitory effect of the compounds of the \ninvention on factor Xa are simple chromogenic assays involving only serene protease, the\ncompound of the invention to be tested, substrate and buffer (see, e.g., Thrombosis Res. (1979),\nVol. 16, pp. 245-254). For example, four tissue human serine proteases can be used in the\nprimary bioassay, free factor Xa, prothrombinase, thrombin (IIa) and tissue plasminogen activator\n(tPA). The assay for TPA has been successfully used before to demonstrate undesired side\neffects in the inhibition of the fibrinolytic process (see, e.g., J. Med. Chem. (1993), Vol. 36,\npp, 314-319). Another bioassay useful in demonstrating the utility of the compounds of the\ninvention in inhibiting factor Xa demonstrates the potency of the compounds against free factor\nXa in citrated plasma. For example, the anticoagulant efficacy of the compounds of the invention\nwill be tested using either the prothrombin time (PT), or activated partial thromboplastin time\n(aPTT) while selectivity of the compounds is checked with the thrombin clotting time (TCT)\nassay. Correlation of the K<sub>i</sub> in the primary enzyme assay with the K<sub>i</sub> for free factor Xa in citrated\nplasma will screen against compounds which interact with or are inactivated by other plasma\ncomponents. Correlation of the K<sub>i</sub> with the extension of the PT is a necessary in vitro\ndemonstration that potency in the free factor Xa inhibition assay translates into potency in a\nclinical coagulation assay. In addition, extension of the PT in citrated plasma can be used to\nmeasure duration of action in subsequent pharmacodynamic studies.</p>\n  For further information on assays to demonstrate the activity of the compounds of the\ninvention, see R. Lottenberg et al., Methods in Enzymology (1981). Vol. 80, pp. 341-361, and H.\nOhno et al., Thrombosis Research (1980), Vol. 19, pp. 579-588.</p>\n  \n    C.

For example, for administration to a 70 kg person, the dosage range would be from about\n10 mg to about 1.0 gram per day of a compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically\nacceptable salt thereof, preferably from about 50 mg to about 700 mg per day, and most\npreferably from about 100 mg to about 500 mg per day.</p>\n  \n    Preferred Embodiments\n  \n  Of the compounds of the invention as set forth above in the Summary of the Invention, a\npreferred group are those compounds wherein Z<sup>1</sup> and Z<sup>2</sup> are each -O-; R<sup>1</sup> is hydrogen or -OR<sup",
    "ed by the preparation of test compound working solutions \n(4X) by a serial dilutions of 10 mM stock solutions with Biomek 1000 (or Multiprobe 204) in 96\ndeep well plates as follows:\n(a) Prepare a 40 \u00b5M working solution by diluting the 10 mM stock 1 to 250 in assay\nbuffer in 2 steps: 1 to 100, and 1 to 2.5.(b) Make another five serial dilutions (1:3) of the 40 \u00b5M solution (600 \u00b5l for each\nconcentration). A total of six diluted test compound solutions were used in the assay.\nStandard inhibitor compound (5 mM stock) or DMSO (control) went through the same dilution\nsteps as those described above for test compounds.</p>\n  The next step in the assay was to dispense 50 \u00b5l of the test compound working solutions\n(4X) (from 40 uM to 0.164 uM) in duplicate to microtiter plates with Biomek or MP204. To this\nwas added 100 \u00b5l of enzyme working solution (2X) with Biomek or MP204. The resulting\nsolutions were incubated at ambient temperature for 10 minutes.</p>\n  To the solutions was added 50 \u00b5l of substrate working solution (4X) with Biomek or\nMP204.</p>\n  The enzyme kinetics were measured at 405 nm at 10 seconds intervals for five minutes in\na THERMOmax plate reader at ambient temperature.</p>\n  Calculation of K<sub>i</sub> of the test compounds:\n  Enzyme rates were calculated as mOD/min based on the first two minutes readings. The IC<sub>50</sub>\nvalues were determined by fitting the data to the log-logit equation (linear) or the Morrison\nequation (non-linear) with an EXCEL spread-sheet. Ki values were then obtained by dividing the\nIC<sub>50</sub> by 2. Routinely, Ki(factor Xa) values less than 3 nM were calculated from the Morrison\nequation.</p>\n  Compounds of the invention, when tested in this assay, demonstrated the selective ability\nto inhibit human factor Xa and human thrombin.</p>\n  \n    EXAMPLE 9\n  \n  (In vitro assay for Human Prothrombinase)\n  This assay demonstrates the ability of the compounds of the invention to inhibit\nprothrombinase. Prothrombinase (PTase) catalyzes the activation of prothrombin to yield\nfragment 1.2 plus thrombin with meizothrombin as the intermediate. This assay is an end point\nassay. Activity of the prothrombinase is measured by activity of thrombin lone of the reaction\nproducts) or by the amount of thrombin formed/time based on a thrombin standard curve ( nM vs\nmOD/min). For determination of IC<sub>50</sub> (PTase) of the compounds of the invention, PTase activity\nwas expressed by thrombin activity (mOD/min). </p>\n  Materials:\n  \n    \n      Enzymes:\n1.
