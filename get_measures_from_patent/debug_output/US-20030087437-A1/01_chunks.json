ID No. 4 of the Sequence Listing) was prepared as follows. Namely, E. coli containing the recombinant plasmid containing DNA encoding the above polypeptide, pYMH-CF\u2022A, i.e., Escherichia coli JM109/pYMH-CF\u2022A (FERM BP-5278) was cultured in 5 ml of LB broth containing 100 \u03bcg/ml of ampicillin at 37\u00b0 C. for 8 hours. This pre-culture broth was inoculated into 500 ml of LB broth containing 100 \u03bcg/ml of ampicillin and 1 mM of IPTG (isopropyl-p-D-thiogalactopyranoside) and cultivated at 37\u00b0 C. overnight. The microbial cells were harvested, suspended in 10 ml of PBS (phosphate buffered saline) containing 1 mM PMSF (phenylmethanesulfonium fluoride) and 0.05% of Nonidet P-40 and sonicated to disrupt the cells. The mixture was centrifuged to obtain a supernatant. To absorbance 4,000 at 260 nm of this supernatant was added 1 ml of 5% polyethylene imine and the mixture was centrifuged to obtain a supernatant. The supernatant was applied to a HiTrap-Heparin column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with PBS. After washing the non-absorbed fraction with PBS, the absorbed fraction was eluted with PBS containing NaCl gradient of from 0.5 M to 2 M. The eluate was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) which showed the presence of two fractions containing 47 kd polypeptide. One fraction of them which was eluted at the higher NaCl concentration was collected and applied to a Superose 6 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with PBS containing 1.5 M NaCl. The eluate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and a fraction containing about 47 kd polypeptide was collected to obtain the purified C-FGF\u2022A which was used in the subsequent steps. </p>[0195] (3) Preparation of C-FGF-CS1 </p>[0196] First, a plasmid was constructed for expressing the polypeptide, C-FCF-CS1 (amino acid sequence is shown in SEQ. ID No. 5 of the Sequence Listing) in Escherichia coli as a host. </p>[0197]Escherichia coli HB101/pCH102 (FERM BP-2800) was cultured and the plasmid pCH102 was prepared by alkali-SDS method from the resulting microbial cells. PCR was carried out using this plasmid as a template as well as primer M4 (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.) and primer CS1-S, nucleotide sequence of which is shown in SEQ. ID No. 9 in the Sequence Listing and an amplified DNA fragment in the reaction solution was recovered with ethanol precipitation. The resultant DNA fragment was digested with NheI and SalI (both Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.), followed by agarose gel electrophoresis to recover about 970 bp DNA fragment from the gel. </p>[0198]Escherichia coli JM109/pYMH-CF\u2022A (FERM BP-5278) was then cultured and the plasmid pYMH-CF\u2022A was prepared by an alkali-SDS method from the resulting microbial cells. PCR reaction was carried out using this plasmid as a template as well as primer CF, nucleotide sequence of which is shown in SEQ. ID No. 10, and primer FNR, nucleotide sequence of which is shown in SEQ. ID No. 11 of the Sequence Listing, and an amplified DNA fragment in the reaction solution was recovered with ethanol precipitation. The resultant DNA fragment",
    "was inserted into E. coli JM109. A plasmid was prepared from the resulting transformant and that containing each one molecule of the above three DNA fragments was selected and named plasmid pCFS100. E. coli JM109 transformed with the plasmid pCFS100 was named Escherichia coli JM109/pCRS100. The plasmid pCFS100 has a CS-1 cell adhesion region derived from fibronectin at the C-terminal of C-FGF\u2022A and encodes the polypeptide, C-FGF-CS1, wherein second lysine from the C-terminal of FGF was substituted with alanine. </p>[0200] The polypeptide, C-FGF-CS1 was prepared as follows. Namely, the above E. coli JM109/pCFS100 was cultured in 5 ml of LB broth containing 100 \u03bcg/ml of ampicillin at 37\u00b0 C. for 8 hours. This pre-cultured broth was inoculated into 500 ml of LB broth containing 100 \u03bcg/ml of ampicillin and 1 mM IPTG and cultured overnight at 37\u00b0 C. to collect the microbial cells. The resulting microbial cells were suspended in 10 ml of PBS (phosphate buffered saline) containing 0.5M NaCl, 1 mM PMSF and 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and the microbial cells were sonicated to disrupt and centrifuged to obtain a supernatant. This supernatant was subjected to HiTrap-Heparin column pre-equilibrated with PBS containing 0.5 M NaCl, the non-adsorbed fractions were washed with PBS containing 0.5 mM NaCl and the adsorbed fraction was eluted with PBS having a concentration gradient of 0.5 M to 2 M NaCl. The eluate was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fractions containing about 50 kd polypeptide were collected to obtain purified C-FGF-CS1 which was used in the subsequent steps. </p>[0201] Amino acid sequence of from N-terminal to the fifth amino acid of purified C-FGF-CS1 thus obtained was investigated and found to be consistent with that shown in SEQ.
