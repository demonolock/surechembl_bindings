Melanocortin receptor-specific cyclic peptides disclosed in the foregoing are typically cyclized through a lactam bridge formed by the side chains of Asp (aspartic acid) and Lys (lysine), or alternatively through a disulfide bridge formed by the side chains of two Cys (cysteine) or other reactive thiol-containing residues.</p>Melanocortin receptor-specific linear peptides are known which contain Glu (glutamic acid) and Orn (ornithine), including certain linear peptides disclosed in WO2008/025094 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,674,839. Cyclic peptides asserted to be specific for one or more melanocortin receptors and containing a Glu and Orn are known, but are peptides in which the cyclic portion thereof consists of seven amino acids, such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,951,916 and 6,613,874. In such peptides, there are five amino acids between the Glu and Orn residues, and thus the cyclic peptide ring contains 26 ring atoms.</p>Melanocortin receptor-specific peptides may be evaluated by a number of parameters, including binding affinities (typically Ki values reported in nM) and various functional measures, such as EC<sub>50 </sub>and E<sub>max </sub>values. While melanocortin receptor-specific cyclic peptides are reported with nanomolar or subnanomolar Ki values, for pharmaceutical development for many indications it is desired and necessary to optimize functionality, such as EC<sub>50 </sub>and E<sub>max </sub>values, such that the peptides are agonists, preferably full agonists, more preferably potent full agonists, with nanomolar or subnanomolar EC<sub>50 </sub>values and E<sub>max </sub>values as high as feasible, such as over about 80%, about 90% or at or over 100%. It is against this background that the present invention was made.</p>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIn one aspect, the present invention relates to a cyclic peptide of formula (I):</p><img id=\"EMI-C00002\" path=\"US09273098-20160301-C00002.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/333662032/US/20160301/B2/000009/27/30/98/US09273098-20160301-C00002.TIF\"/>\nincluding all enantiomers, stereoisomers or diastereoisomers thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of any of the foregoing,\n</p>wherein:\nR<sub>1 </sub>is \u2014R<sub>10</sub>-R<sub>11</sub>;R<sub>2 </sub>is \u2014H, \u2014CH<sub>3 </sub>or \u2014CH<sub>2</sub>\u2014, and if it is \u2014CH<sub>2</sub>\u2014 forms with R<sub>3 </sub>a ring of the general structure\n</p><img id=\"EMI-C00003\" path=\"US09273098-20160301-C00003.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/333662116/US/20160301/B2/000009/27/30/98/US09273098-20160301-C00003.TIF\"/>R<sub>3 </sub>is \u2014H, \u2014(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>z</sub>\u2014 if R<sub>2 </sub>is \u2014CH<sub>2</sub>\u2014, and if it is \u2014(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>z</sub>\u2014 forms the ring with R<sub>2</sub>, or R<sub",

Thus, \u201cAla\u201d is alanine, \u201cAsn\u201d is asparagine, \u201cAsp\u201d is aspartic acid, \u201cArg\u201d is arginine, \u201cCys\u201d is cysteine, \u201cGly\u201d is glycine, \u201cGln\u201d is glutamine, \u201cGlu\u201d is glutamic acid, \u201cHis\u201d is histidine, \u201cIle\u201d is isoleucine, \u201cLeu\u201d is leucine, \u201cLys\u201d is lysine, \u201cMet\u201d is methionine, \u201cPhe\u201d is phenylalanine, \u201cPro\u201d is proline, \u201cSer\u201d is serine, \u201cThr\u201d is Threonine, \u201cTrp\u201d is tryptophan, \u201cTyr\u201d is tyrosine, and \u201cVal\u201d is valine, and so on.

    " and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers.</p>By a melanocortin receptor \u201cagonist\u201d is meant an endogenous substance, drug substance or compound, including a compound such as the peptides of the present invention, which can interact with a melanocortin receptor and initiate a pharmacological response, including but not limited to adenyl cyclase activation, characteristic of the melanocortin receptor. A melanocortin receptor agonist may be an agonist at one or more of melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4-R), melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1-R), melanocortin-3 receptor (MC3-R) and melanocortin-5 receptor (MC5-R).</p>By \u201c\u03b1-MSH\u201d is meant the peptide Ac-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Met-Glu-His-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys-Pro-Val-NH<sub>2 </sub>(SEQ ID NO:2) and analogs and homologs thereof, including without limitation NDP-\u03b1-MSH.</p>By \u201cNDP-\u03b1-MSH\u201d is meant the peptide Ac-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Nle-Glu-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys-Pro-Val-NH<sub>2 </sub>and analogs and homologs thereof.</p>By \u201cEC<sub>50</sub>\u201d is meant the molar concentration of an agonist, including a partial agonist, which produced 50% of the maximum possible response for that agonist. By way of example, a test compound which, at a concentration of 72 nM, produces 50% of the maximum possible response for that compound as determined in a cAMP assay in an MC4-R cell expression system has an EC<sub>50 </sub>of 72 nM. Unless otherwise specified, the molar concentration associated with an EC<sub>50 </sub>determination is in nanomoles per liter (nM).</p>By \u201cKi (nM)\u201d is meant the equilibrium inhibitor dissociation constant representing the molar concentration of a competing compound that binds to half the binding sites of a receptor at equilibrium in the absence of radioligand or other competitors. In general, the numeric value of the Ki is inversely correlated to the affinity of the compound for the receptor, such that if the Ki is low, the affinity is high. Ki may be determined using the equation of Cheng and Prusoff (Cheng Y., Prusoff W. H., Biochem. Pharmacol. 22: 3099-3108, 1973):</p>Ki=EC501+[ligand]KD\nwhere \u201cligand\u201d is the concentration of radioligand and K<sub>D </sub>is an inverse measure of receptor affinity for the radioligand which produces 50% receptor occupancy by the radioligand. Unless otherwise specified, the molar concentration associated with a Ki determination is in nM. Ki may be expressed in terms of specific receptors (e.g., MC1-R, MC3-R, MC4-R or MC5-R) and specific ligands (e.g., \u03b1-MSH or NDP-\u03b1-MSH).\n</p>By \u201cinhibition\u201d is meant the percent attenuation, or decrease in receptor binding, in a competitive inhibition assay compared to a known standard. Thus, by \u201cinhibition at 1 \u03bcM (NDP-\u03b1-MSH)\u201d is meant the percent decrease in binding of NDP-\u03b1-MSH by addition of a determined amount of the compound to be tested, such as 1 \u03bcM of a test compound, such as under the assay conditions hereafter described. By way of example, a test compound that does not inhibit binding of NDP-\u03b1-MSH has a 0% inhibition, and a test compound that completely inhibits binding of NDP-\u03b1-MSH has a 100% inhibition. Typically, as described hereafter, a radio assay is used for competitive inhibition testing, such as with I<sup>125</sup>-labeled NDP-\u03b1-MSH, or a lanthanide chelate fluorescent assay, such as with Eu-NDP-\u03b1-MSH. However, other methods of testing competitive inhibition are known, including use of label or tag systems other than radioisotopes, and in general any method known in the art for testing competitive inhibition may be employed in this invention. It may thus be seen that \u201cinhibition\u201d is one measure to determine whether a test compound attenuates binding of \u03b1-MSH to melanocortin receptors.</p>By \u201cbinding affinity\u201d is meant the ability of a compound or drug to bind to its biological target, expressed herein as Ki (nM).</p>By \u201cE<sub>max</sub>\u201d is meant the maximal functional activity achievable by a compound in a specified melanocortin receptor expressing cell system, such as the maximal stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. The maximal stimulation achieved by NDP-\u03b1-MSH is designated as an E<sub>max </sub>of 100% and a compound capable of stimulating half the maximal activity of NDP-\u03b1-MSH is designated as having an E<sub>max </sub>of 50%. A compound of this invention that under assay conditions described herein has an E<sub>max </sub>of 70% or higher is classified as an agonist, a compound with an E<sub>max </sub>between 10% and 70% is classified as a partial agonist, and a compound with an E<sub>max </sub>below 10% is classified as inactive.</p>In general, \u201cfunctional activity\u201d is a measure of the signaling of a receptor, or measure of a change in receptor-associated signaling, such as a melanocortin receptor, and in particular MC4-R or hMC4-R, upon activation by a compound. Melanocortin receptors initiate signal transduction through activation of heterotrimeric G proteins. In one aspect, melanocortin receptors signal through G\u03b1<sub>S</sub>, which catalyzes production of cAMP by adenylyl cyclase. Thus determination of stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, such as determination of maximal stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, is one measure of functional activity, and is the primary measure exemplified herein. However, it is to be understood that alternative measures of functional activity may be ",
    "l layer of cells may be employed. Administration means may thus include administration through mucous membranes, buccal administration, oral administration, dermal administration, inhalation administration, nasal administration, urethral administration, vaginal administration, and the like.</p>6.4 Therapeutically Effective Amount.</p>In general, the actual quantity of cyclic peptide of the present invention administered to a patient will vary between fairly wide ranges depending upon the mode of administration, the formulation used, and the response desired. The dosage for treatment is administration, by any of the foregoing means or any other means known in the art, of an amount sufficient to bring about the desired therapeutic effect. The cyclic peptides of the present invention are highly active. For example, the cyclic peptide can be administered at about 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 50, 100, 500, 1000 or 5000 \u03bcg/kg body weight, depending on the specific peptide selected, the desired therapeutic response, the route of administration, the formulation and other factors known to those of skill in the art.</p>7.0 Tests and Assays Employed in Evaluation of the Peptides of the Present InventionThe melanocortin receptor-specific peptides of the present invention of this invention may be tested by a variety of assay systems and animal models to determine binding, functional status and efficacy.</p>7.1 Competitive Inhibition Assay using [I<sup>125</sup>]-NDP-\u03b1-MSH.</p>A competitive inhibition binding assay was performed using membrane homogenates prepared from HEK-293 cells that express recombinant hMC4-R, hMC3-R, or hMC5-R, and from B-16 mouse melanoma cells (containing endogenous MC1-R). In some instances, HEK-293 cells that express recombinant hMC1-R were employed. In the examples that follow, all MC3-R, MC4-R and MC5-R values are for human recombinant receptors. MC1-R values are for B-16 mouse melanoma cells, unless the heading is \u201chMC1-R\u201d, in which case the value is for human recombinant MC1-R. Assays were performed in 96 well GF/B Millipore multiscreen filtration plates (MAFB NOB10) pre-coated with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Fraction V). Membrane homogenates were incubated with 0.2 nM (for hMC4-R) 0.4 nM (for MC3-R and MC5-R) or 0.1 nM (for mouse B16 MC1-R or hMC1-R) [I<sup>125</sup>]-NDP-\u03b1-MSH (Perkin Elmer) and increasing concentrations of test peptides of the present invention in buffer containing 25 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) with 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.3 mM 1,10-phenanthroline, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. After incubation for 60 minutes at 37\u00b0 C., the assay mixture was filtered and the membranes washed three times with ice-cold buffer. Filters were dried and counted in a gamma counter for bound radioactivity. Non-specific binding was measured by inhibition of binding of [I<sup>125</sup>]-NDP-\u03b1-MSH in the presence of 1 \u03bcM NDP-\u03b1-MSH. Maximal specific binding (100%) was defined as the difference in radioactivity (cpm) bound to cell membranes in the absence and presence of 1 \u03bcM NDP-\u03b1-MSH. Radioactivity (cpm) obtained in the presence of test peptides was normalized with respect to 100% specific binding to determine the percent inhibition of [I<sup>125</sup>]-NDP-\u03b1-MSH binding. Ki values for test peptides of the present invention were determined using Graph-Pad Prism\u00ae curve-fitting software.</p>7.2 Competitive Binding Assay Using Eu-NDP-\u03b1-MSH</p>Alternatively, a competitive inhibition binding assay was performed employing Eu-NDP-\u03b1-MSH (PerkinElmer Life Sciences catalog No. AD0225) with determination by time-resolved fluorometry (TRF) of the lanthanide chelate. In comparison studies with [I<sup>125</sup>]-NDP-\u03b1-MSH, the same values, within experimental error ranges, were obtained for percent inhibition and Ki. Typically competition experiments to determine Ki values were conducted by incubating membrane homogenates prepared from HEK-293 cells that express recombinant hMC4-R with 9 different concentrations of test peptides of interest and 1 nM of Eu-NDP-\u03b1-MSH in a solution containing 25 mM HEPES buffer with 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1% BSA and 0.3 mM 1,10-phenanthroline. After incubation for 90 minutes at 37\u00b0 C., the reaction was stopped by filtration over AcroWell 96-well filter plates (Pall Life Sciences). The filter plates were washed 4 times with 200 \u03bcL of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. DELFIA Enhancement solution (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to each well. The plates were incubated on a shaker for 15 minutes and read at 340 nm excitation and 615 nm emission wavelengths. Each assay was conducted in duplicate and mean values were utilized. Ki values were determined by curve-fitting with Graph-Pad Prism\u00ae software using a one-site fixed-slope competition binding model.</p>7.3 Assay for Agonist Activity.</p>Accumulation of intracellular cAMP was examined as a measure of the ability of the peptides of the present invention to elicit a functional response in HEK-293 cells that express MC4-R. Confluent HEK-293 cells that express recombinant hMC4-R were detached from culture plates by incubation in enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer. Dispersed cells were suspended in Earle's Balanced Salt Solution containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM glutamine, 0.5% albumin and 0.3 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine (IBMX), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. The cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 0.5\u00d710<sup>5 </sup>cells per well and pre-incubated for 10 minutes. Cells were exposed for 15 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. to peptides of the present invention dissolved in DMSO (final DMSO concentration of 1%) at a concentration range of 0.05-5000 nM in a total assay volume of 200 \u03bcL. NDP-\u03b1-MSH was used as the reference agonist. cAMP levels were determined by an HTRF\u00ae cAMP cell-based assay system from Cisbio Bioassays utilizing cryptate-labeled anti-cAMP and d2-labeled cAMP, with plates read on a Perkin-Elmer Victor plate reader at 665 and 620 nM. Data analysis was performed by nonlinear regression analysis with Graph-Pad Prism\u00ae software. The maximum efficacies of the test peptides of the present invention were compa",
    "rived from His-Phe-Arg-Trp typically will include unsubstituted or substituted Phe in the Phe position, such as substituted or subsubstituted D-Phe, but a variety of amino acids may be utilitized for the remaining amino acids in the core sequence. In general, the His position may be a substituted or unsubstituted Pro, or may be an amino acid with a side chain including at least one primary amine, secondary amine, alkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloheteroalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, alcohol, ether, sulfide, sulfone, sufoxide, carbamoyl or carboxyl. The Arg position may be a substituted or unsubstituted Pro, or may be an amino acid with a side chain including at least one primary amine, secondary amine, guanidine, urea, alkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloheteroalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, or ether. The Trp position may be an amino acid with a side chain including at least one substituted or unsubstituted aryl or heteroaryl.</p>In another aspect, it has been found that a lactam bridge wherein the amide bond is positioned by means of the side chain of Glu or Orn (at the N-terminus of the cyclic portion) and the side chain of Orn or Glu (at the C-terminus end of the cyclic portion) has superior efficacy, such as efficacy determined by EC<sub>50 </sub>or E<sub>max </sub>values, compared to peptides wherein the lactam bridge amide bond is positioned by means of the side chains of Asp and Lys, but which are otherwise identical. Such peptides do not necessarily show increased binding affinity, such as measured by Ki values, compared to peptides wherein the lactam bridge amide bond is positioned by means of the side chains of Asp and Lys, but which are otherwise identical. However, for many diagnostic and medical applications the functional efficacy, such as efficacy determined by EC<sub>50 </sub>or E<sub>max </sub>values, is critical for desired biological and/or pharmacological activities. This discovery is contrary to assertions in the prior art that the location and direction of an amide bond in the lactam bridge of melanocortin receptor-specific peptides is of little importance for activity, and does not interact with receptors. See, for example, Bednarek M A et al., Potent and selective peptide agonists of \u03b1-melanotropin action at human melanocortin receptor 4: their systhesis and biological evaluation in vitro. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 286:641-645 (2001).</p>Cyclic peptides of the invention accordingly include those wherein the side chains of the amino acids forming a cyclic lactam bridge have the structure \u2014(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>\u2014C(\u2550O)\u2014NH\u2014(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>\u2014 or \u2014(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>\u2014NH\u2014C(\u2550O)\u2014(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. Such compounds may, but need not, include peptides where an amino acid in the first position outside the cyclic portion has a side chain including at least one primary amine, guanidine or urea group. Alternatively, the amino acid in the first position outside the cyclic portion may be any amino acid, including without limitation amin",

Orn lactam shift, utilizing data as reported in Table 3. In all instances but two, functional efficacies were improved or maintained utilizing cyclization through Glu . . . Orn, as compared to otherwise identical analogs cyclized through Asp . . . Lys. The improvement was most dramatic at the low end, with weak partial agonists demonstrating more significant improvement in functional efficacy than strong full agonists.</p>FIG. 4 shows the change of functional potency (EC<sub>50</sub>) caused by the side-chain Glu . . . Orn lactam shift, utilizing data as reported in Table 3. All the cyclic peptides demonstrate an improvement in or maintenance of functional potency after this shift.</p>As shown in FIG. 5, by contrast Ki values, representing binding affinity, did not show a consistent significant change after side-chain Glu . . . Orn lactam shift. Thus the observed improvement of MC4-R functional agonist activity, as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4 and Table 3, is not caused by an increase of binding affinity. This result supports the hypothesis that the shifted lactam group results in modified hydrogen bond interaction with His<sup>264 </sup>which affects functional efficacy and potency without significantly or consistently increasing binding affinity.</p>As shown in Table 3, some peptides that were partial agonists with cyclization through Asp and Lys were converted to full agonists by cyclization through Glu and Orn. Accordingly, it may be that certain MC4-R neutral agonists or antagonists can be converted into full or partial agonists by utilizing cyclization through Glu and Orn.</p>FIG. 6 shows the change of functional efficacy (E<sub>max</sub>) due to the side-chain Orn . . . Glu lactam shift, utilizing data as reported in Table 4. In all instances but two, functional efficacies were improved or maintained utilizing cyclization through Orn . . . Glu, as compared to otherwise identical analogs cyclized through Asp . . . Lys. The improvement was most dramatic at the low end, with weak partial agonists demonstrating more significant improvement in functional efficacy than strong full agonists.</p>FIG. 7 shows the change of functional potency (EC<sub>50</sub>) caused by the side-chain Orn . . . Glu lactam shift, utilizing data as reported in Table 4. All but one cyclic peptide demonstrated an improvement in functional potency after this shift.</p>As shown in FIG. 8, Ki values, representing binding affinity, also showed a slight but consistent change after the side-chain Orn . . . Glu lactam shift. Thus the observed improvement of MC4-R functional agonist activity, as shown in FIGS. 6 and 7 and Table 5, may also relate in part to an increase in binding affinity with Orn . . . Glu cyclized peptides compared to paired Asp . . . Lys peptides.</p>Although the invention has been described in detail with particular reference to these preferred embodiments, other embodiments can achieve the same results.
