{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences in the provided text that contain all four required components: a specific molecule name, ID or other identifier, a bioactivity metric (IC50, Ki, Kd, EC50 and their variations), a specific numeric value for that metric, and a unit for that value. The text primarily discusses various sugar chains, glycoproteins, and their potential use in pharmaceutical compositions without providing specific bioactivity metrics with numeric values and units."}
