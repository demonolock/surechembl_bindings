    "FIELD OF INVENTIONThe present invention relates to a preventive or therapeutic pharmaceutical composition having an inhibitory effect on the overproduction and the accumulation of extracellular matrix, said composition comprising as an active ingredient a compound that inhibits the biological activity of galectin-3.</p>BACKGROUND ARTGalectin-3 is a protein that has a molecular weight of about 30 Kd belonging to the family of \u03b2-galactoside-binding protein and is a lectin that widely occurs on the cell surface, the cytoplasm and the nucleus of the tissue (see, for example, Barondes, S. H: et al., J. Biol. Chem. (1994) 296: 20807-20810, Hughes, R. C. Glycobiology (1994) 4: 5-12, Wang, L. et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. (1995) 217: 292-303, and the like). It is known that galectin-3 binds to a suitable sugar chain portion of glycoprotein present on the cell surface or in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and thereby activates inflammatory cells such as neutrophils, basophils, or macrophages to promote the production of cytokines from these cells (see, for example, Sato, S. et al., J. Biol. Chem. (1994a) 269: 4424-4430, Liu, F. T. Immunol. Today (1993) 14: 486-490), or to suppress the apoptotic death of T cells by its overexpression (see Yang, R-Y, H. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. (1996) 93: 6737-6742), and it is believed to be an important protein responsible for inflammatory and immunological reactions. It has also been suggested that cell surface-exposed galectin-3 is involved in the formation of cell aggregates (see Probstmeier, R. et al., J. Neurochemistry (1995) 64(6):2465-2472).</p>Furthermore, galectin-3 is also known to play an important role in the formation and repair of the tissue since it is highly expressed during the damage repair period in the rat lung-injured model induced by X-ray irradiation (see Kasper, M. et al., J. Pathol. (1996) 179: 309",
