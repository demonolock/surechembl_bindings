    "xample 15The C-20 Peptide Elicits a Protective Immune Response Against HIV Infection in the MT4 Lymphocyte Cell LineThe anti-HIV action of antibodies was tested by using HIV-1 LAI isolate on MT4 cells. Cells were infected with HIV by incubation at 37\u00b0 C. for 90 min. The cell suspension was then centrifuged to remove the medium containing unbound HIV. The cell pellet was then suspended in fresh culture medium in the absence or presence of the anti-C-20 sera from Hermione at a dilution of 1/25. Cells were passaged every 2-3 days. The culture supernatant was assayed for the production of HIV by the p24 ELISA assay (FIG. 17).</p>These results show that antibodies against the C-20 peptide in caveolin are capable of inhibiting HIV infection. The pre-immune S0 and S1 sera had no apparent anti-HIV action whereas S2 and S3 (i.e., after the third and fourth immunization) had a very strong inhibitory activity; 77% and 98% respectively (FIG. 17).</p>Further immunization of rabbits with the C-20 peptide (following the fifth immunization) the neutralizing antibody declined drastically as the S4 and S5 sera had no significant effect on HIV infection. The reason for this latter effect remains to be elucidated. Whatever is the case, these observations provide further evidence for the implication of the caveolin-binding domain in the viral transmembrane glycoprotein during the HIV infectious cycle. Consequently, anti-C-20 antibodies could also be used as a means to block HIV infection.</p>The IC50 value of the rabbit Hermione S3 serum against HIV-1 LAI infection in MT4 cells is obtained around the 1/60th dilution.</p>Example 16Inhibition of HIV Infection by the Anti-CBD-1 Antibodies Against Laboratory Adapted and Primary Viral Isolates in Primary CD4+ T LymphocytesCD4<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes were prepared from PBMC after depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> cells using Dynabeads M-450 CD8. CD4+ cells were then stimulated with PHA and cultured for 3 days in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cell were then suspended in fresh culture medium containing IL-2. After 24 hours, cells were infected with the different isolates of HIV-1. Virus infection was monitored by measuring p24 ELISA in the culture supernatant at different days post infection.</p>The inhibitory action of the immune serum Aldernay S4 against the CBD-1 peptide was investigated in CD4<sup>+</sup> primary T lymphocyte cultures infected with the T-lymphocyte tropic (X4) HIV-1 LAI, macrophage-tropic (R5) HIV-Ba-L, X4 HIV-1 ELI isolate from Zaire, an isolate resistant to the nonnucleoside RT inhibitor nevirapine (HIV-1 N199), an isolate resistant to the HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir (HIV-1 SR), and the primary isolate HIV-1 92UGO37. Primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes were incubated with different virus isolates for 90 min at 37\u00b0 C. in the presence of the pre-immune serum Aldernay S0 (at 1/25, 1/50, and 1/100 dilution) and the immune serum Aldernay S4 (at 1/25, 1/50, and 1/100 dilution). Cells were then centrifuged to remove the supernatant containing unbound HIV. Infected cells were suspended in fresh culture medium supplemented with the different rabbit sera. Cells were passaged on day 3 by the addition of 1 volume of fresh culture medium supplemented with the different sera.</p>The preimmune serum S0 had no inhibitory effect on infection by HIV-1 Ba-L, HIV-1 SR, and HIV-1 92UGO37, while there was 25 and 50% enhancement of virus production in the case of HIV-1 LAI and HIV-1 199/HIV-1 ELI, respectively. A typical result of the S0 serum on HIV-1 LAI infection is shown in FIG. 18A. On the other hand, the immune serum S4 had a dose dependent inhibition of virus production, with IC95% values at 1/25- 1/50 dilutions, and IC50 values at 1/50 1/100 dilutions (FIGS. 18A and B, and Table 3).</p>FIG. 19 shows the kinetics of inhibition of HIV infection by the anti-CBD-1 antibodies against R5 HIV-1 Ba-L and the HIV-1 isolate resistant to the HIV proease inhibitor saquinavir (HIV-1 SR) in primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocyte culture.</p>Virus infection of CD4<sup>+</sup> primary T lymphocytes was carried out as in the legend of FIG. 8 with HIV-1 Ba-L and HIV-1 SR in the absence (Control) or presence of the immune serum S4 at 1/25, 1/50, and 1/100 dilutions (as it is indicated in FIG. 19). Culture supernatants at 3, 4, and 5 days post-infection were assayed by ELISA for the concentration p24. Each point represents the mean of duplicate samples.</p>These observations indicate the potent anti-HIV action of the anti-CBD-1 antibodies in a primary cell culture permissive to HIV infection. Furthermore, the fact that anti-CBD-1 antibodies inhibit virus isolates that have specific modifications in their respective CBD-1 domain (See amino acid sequence of the CBD-1 peptide and sequences of HIV-1 LAI, Ba-L, ELI and and 92UGO37) points out that the CBD-1 peptide is capable of eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies.</p>TABLE 3The inhibitory action of the immune serum againstCBD-1 in primary CD4<sup>+ </sup>T lymphocytes against differentlaboratory and primary HIV-1 isolates.HIV-1 IsolateIC95IC50LAI 1/25th dilution 1/40th dilutionBa-L 1/25th dilution 1/50th dilutionHIV-1 ELI 1/25th dilution 1/50th dilutionHIV-",
