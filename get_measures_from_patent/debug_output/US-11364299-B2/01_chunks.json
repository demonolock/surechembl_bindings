    "ional analgesia techniques, and local nerve block techniques, as well as mid-humerus brachial plexus block, lumber plexus block, femoral nerve-sciatic nerve block and the like.</p>The history of local anesthetics has been more than 150 years since the discovery and use thereof. As early as in 1860, Albert Niemann, student of German chemist Friedrich Wohler, extracted an alkaloid from coca leaves in a laboratory of the University of Gottingen and named it cocaine. In 1884, under Freund's advice, Koller used cocaine in eye surgeries and achieved excellent effects; in the next year, Halstead and Corning used cocaine in mandibular nerve block and dog spinal anesthesia experiments respectively, which was regarded as the beginning of use of this drug in local nerve block and epidural nerve block. Procaine was discovered by Einhron in 1904 and applied clinically by Braum in the next year. Tetracaine was synthesized by Firsleb in 1928, lidocaine by Lofgren and Lundguist in 1943, and a series of local anesthetics, such as benzocaine, dibucaine, bupivacaine, prilocaine, and mepivacaine, appeared thereafter. Up till now, two classes of local anesthetics, including the ester-type and the amide-type, have been established.</p>Ropivacaine is a long-acting amide-type local anesthetic synthesized in recent years, and, as a result of further optimization of bupivacaine, has a fundamental structure of 1-propy 1-2,6-pipeco loxylidide laevo isomer, pH 7.4, pKa 8.1, low liposolubility and a high dissociation constant. Therefore, the sensitivity thereof to C fibers is substantially higher than to A fibers, and a clear phenomenon of discrimination of motor nerve block from sensory nerve block is demonstrated. Epidural absorption of ropivacaine molecules shows a dimorphic profile, with a half-time of fast phase of 14 min and a half-time of slow phase of 4 h. Ropivacaine predominantly associates with plasma proteins (94%) in a concentration-dependent manner with a steady distribution volume of 47 L. Ropivacaine acts in the same mechanism as that of local anesthetics such as procaine, lidocaine, and bupivacaine, by inhibiting neural cell sodium channels and blocking nerve excitation and conduction.<sup>[3,4]</sup></p>With constant progression in researches on ropivacaine action mechanism and continuing exploration in clinical applications, the analgesic efficacy of ropivacaine used alone or in combination with opioid drugs has been established clinically in a wide range. Such efficacy may be generalized in the following aspects: 1) local infiltration anesthetic analgesia (ropivacaine was used both pre- and post-operatively by Sakellaris et al.<sup>[5] </sup>in performing descending inguinal herniorrhaphy under general anesthesia, showing a substantial and lasting analgesic effect with few adverse reactions, which was superior than a fentanyl controlled-release percutaneous patch group); 2) nerve block (Qihong ZHAO et al.<sup>[6] </sup>conducted comparative researches on t"
