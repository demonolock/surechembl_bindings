    "er acyl, halogen (e.g., Cl, Br), CN, NH2, or phenyl.</p>The linker can also be of polymeric nature. The linker may include polymer chains or units that are biostable or biodegradable. Polymers with repeat linkage may have varying degrees of stability under physiological conditions depending on bond lability. Polymers may contain bonds such as polycarbonates (\u2014O\u2014C(O)\u2014O\u2014), polyesters (\u2014C(O)\u2014O\u2014), polyurethanes (\u2014NH\u2014C(O)\u2014O\u2014), polyamide (\u2014C(O)\u2014NH\u2014). These bonds are provided by way of examples, and are not intended to limit the type of bonds employable in the polymer chains or linkers of the invention. Suitable polymers include, for example, polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol, polyamino acids, divinylether maleic anhydride, N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-methacrylicamide, dextran, dextran derivatives, polypropylene glycol, polyoxyethylated polyol, heparin, heparin fragments, polysaccharides, cellulose and cellulose derivatives, starch and starch derivatives, polyalkylene glycol and derivatives thereof, copolymers of polyalkylene glycols and derivatives thereof, polyvinyl ethyl ether, and the klike and mixtures thereof. A polymer linker is for example PEG. An exemplary non-peptide linker is a polyethylene glycol linker:</p><img id=\"EMI-C00018\" path=\"US10005829-20180626-C00018.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/442352082/US/20180626/B2/000010/00/58/29/US10005829-20180626-C00018.TIF\"/>\nwherein the linker has a molecular weight of 100 to 5000 kD, for example, 100 to 500 kD.\n</p>Preferably, the linking moiety contains one or more amino acid moieties such as for example (O2Oc) unit or C<sub>1-4</sub>alkylene-C(O)\u2014, C<sub>1-4</sub>alkylene, \u2014NH\u2014C<sub>2-6</sub>alkylene-NH\u2014 or \u2014NH\u2014CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>\u2014O\u2014CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>\u2014NH\u2014 diamino units or combination thereof and the linking moiety links 2 reactive groups or functional groups.</p>Preferably, the reactive groups or functional groups are maleimide, thiol or pyridine-2-yldisulfanyl.</p>Preparation of Peptide or Polypeptide and Peptide-linker Construct for Attachment to a Half-life Extending Moiety:</p>The peptides and polypeptides of the present invention can be produced by the per se known procedures for peptide synthesis. The methods for peptide synthesis may be any of a solid-phase synthesis and a liquid-phase synthesis. Thus, the peptide and polypeptide of interest can be produced by condensing a partial peptide or amino acid capable of constituting the protein with the residual part thereof and, when the product has a protective group, the protective group is detached whereupon a desired peptide can be manufactured. The known methods for condensation and deprotection include the procedures described in the following literature (1)-(5).\n(1) M. Bodanszky and M. A.
