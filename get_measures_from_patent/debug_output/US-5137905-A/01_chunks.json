    "s diamine with acetic anhydride gave (R)-1-acetyl-2-[3-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-propynyl]pyrrolidine. Related products (see, Table 4) were prepared by treating the diamine with other acylating reagents.</p>A series of dimethylamine analogues were prepared by the same reaction sequence, by reacting XVI with paraformaldehyde and dimethylamine. The reaction sequence was repeated with (S)-prolinol to give the enantiomeric series of compounds (see, Table 5). These products can also be obtained in racemic form by the same reaction sequence using racemic 2-(hydroxymethyl)pyrrolidine (prolinol) as the starting material.</p>The compounds of the invention have central nervous system activity and therefore, are useful in the treatment of mental disorders such as senile dementia, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, mania and depression, extrapyramidal motor disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Huntingtons chorea, tardive dyskensia, disorders of the parasympathetic nervous system such as post-operative abdominal distension, gastric atony, irritable colon syndrome, colitis diverticulitus, biliary colic, peptic ulcers, urine retention and renal colic, or glaucoma or as analgesics for the treatment of pain.</p>Compounds useful for improving mental performance are recognized as cholinergic agonists or partial agonists. These compounds can also be useful as analgesics and for the treatment of glaucoma. The agonists are easily identified from cholinergic receptor binding results by calculating the Ki ratios. Any compound having a Ki ratio of at least ten is considered an agonist or partial agonist and, therefore, a pharmaceutical candidate for improved mental performance or as an analgesic. Whereas compounds having a Ki ratio less than ten are considered antagonist which are useful in the treatment of extrapyramidal motor disorders.</p>The activities of the new heterocyclic acetylenic amine compounds of structure i are shown in Tables 1, 2 and 3. The activities of compounds of Structure ii are shown in Tables 4 and 5. The compounds numbers listed in the Tables correspond to the same Example number.</p>The pharmacological activity for each of the compounds prepared is reported on the respective Tables 1-5. The biological methods employed were as follows:</p>Cholinergic receptor binding data for each of the compounds was obtained using the tritiated ligands oxotremorine M and quinuclidine benzylate.</p>Oxotremorine antagonist assays were performed on groups of six mice weighing 18-22 g. Each was dosed intraperitoneally with the test compound prepared in 0.25% methylcellulose and were placed in individual cages. Twenty minutes later the mice were injected subcutaneously with 0.5 mg/kg of oxotremorine dissolved in saline. Ten minutes later the mice were scored for body tremor. Doses of the compound under study began at 100 mg/kg and were decreased at a 0.5 log interval until no responders were obtained. The procedure described by Spearman and Karber, Finney, D. J., \"Statistical Methods in Biological Assay\", Chapter 20, was used to calculate the ED<sub>50</sub> and 95% confidence intervals.</p>For determination of analgesic activity, the test compound was injected subcutaneously into a group o"
