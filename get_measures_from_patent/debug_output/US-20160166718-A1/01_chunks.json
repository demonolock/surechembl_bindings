Age-related or tobacco-related diseases include cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, osteoarthritis, cardiac diastolic dysfunction, benign prostatic hypertrophy, aortic aneurysm, and emphysema.</p>In a sixth aspect, the invention features a method for identifying a peptide or polypeptide capable of detecting senescent cells by (a) culturing cells to produce senescent cells, (b) exposing the senescent cells to a phage peptide library, (c) recovering the senescent cells and phage from said phage peptide library bound to said senescent cells, (d) eluting and amplifying bound phage to produce amplified phage, (e) repeating steps (a)-(d) one or more times, and (f) recovering a peptide or polypeptide expressed by the amplified phage that is capable of detecting senescent cells.</p>In a seventh aspect, the invention features a method for identifying an antibody or antibody fragment capable of specifically binding to a senescent cell-specific antigen by contacting an antibody or antibody fragment with a polypeptide having at least 20 amino acids having at least 80% amino acid sequence identity to any one of the amino acid sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOS:11-23, and identifying an antibody or antibody fragment that binds the polypeptide with a dissociation constant of less than 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>M.</p>In an eighth aspect, the invention features a method for identifying an antibody or antibody fragment capable of specifically binding to a senescent cell-specific antigen by administering a polypeptide having at least 20 amino acids having at least 80% amino acid sequence identity to any one of the amino acid sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOS:11-23 to a mammal, allowing the mammal to generate a humoral immune response to the polypeptide, and identifying an antibody or antibody fragment that binds the polypeptide with a dissociation constant of less than 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>M. Mammals suitable for the identification of antibodies that specifically bind senescent cell-specific antigens include mice, hamsters, rats, guinea pigs, chickens, goats, sheep, cows, horses, non-human primates, and humans.</p>In an ninth aspect, the invention features a method for identifying a small molecule capable of specifically binding to a senescent cell-specific antigen by contacting a small molecule with a polypeptide having at least 20 amino acids having at least 80% amino acid sequence identity to any one of the amino acid sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOS:11-23 and identifying a small molecule that binds the polypeptide with a dissociation constant of less than 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>M.</p>In an tenth aspect, the invention features a method of making an antibody or antibody fragment by recombinantly expressing a nucleic acid sequence that encodes an amino acid sequence having one or more of SEQ ID NOs:1-3 and 5-8, wherein the antibody or antibody fragment specifically binds a senescent cell.</p>In an eleventh aspect, the invention features a method of cellular therapy performed by administering to a mammal, such as a human, in need thereof an agent of the invention prior to, concurrent with, or following administration of a cellular therapeutic.</p>In an twelfth aspect, the invention features a method of cellular therapy performed by contacting an agent of the invention to a donor cell, tissue, or organ prior to, concurrent with, or following administration of the cell, tissue, or organ to a mammal, such as a human. A donor cell, tissue, or organ can be an autologous, allogeneic, syngeneic, or xenogeneic cell, tissue, or organ. A donor cell can be a stem cell, such as a hematopoietic, umbilical cord blood, totipotent, multipotent, or pluripotent stem cell.</p>In a thirteenth aspect, the invention features a kit containing an agent of the invention and one or more of a detectable label, a therapeutic agent, a chelating agent, or a linker moiety.</p>The term \u201cabout\u201d is used herein to mean a value that is \u00b110% of the recited value.</p>By \u201cadministration\u201d or \u201cadministering\u201d is meant a method of providing a do",
    " for 2-amino-butyric acid, amino valeric acid, beta-aminopropionic acid, homoserine, norleucine, norvaline, (2, 3, or 4) 3-pyridyl-Ala, 1,4-diaminobutyric acid, and 1,3-diaminopropionic acid, respectively. In all aspects of the invention, it is noted that when amino acids are not designated as either D- or L-amino acids, the amino acid is either an L-amino acid or could be either a D- or L-amino acid. Examples of peptides of the invention include those peptides having the sequence of, or a sequence substantially identical to, the sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOs:1-3 and 5-8 and related sequences. These peptide sequences can also be incorporated into a polypeptide, protein, antibody, or antibody fragment.</p>By \u201creducing agent\u201d is meant a chemical compound used to reduce another chemical compound by donating electrons, thereby becoming oxidized.</p>By \u201cspecifically binds\u201d is meant that an agent of the invention recognizes and binds to a target (e.g., a senescent cell), but does not substantially recognize and bind to a non-target (e.g., non-senescent cells), both in vivo and in a sample, e.g., an in vitro biological sample, that includes, e.g., senescent cells. A desirable agent of the invention specifically binds to senescent cells. Preferably, the agents of the invention bind senescent cells with at least 2, 5, 10, 20, 100, or 1000 fold greater affinity than they bind to non-senescent cells. Alternatively, agents of the invention specifically bind to senescent cells with a dissociation constant less than 10<sup>\u22126</sup>M, more preferably less than 10<sup>\u22127</sup>M, 10<sup>\u22128</sup>M, 10<sup>\u22129</sup>M, 10<sup>\u221210 </sup>M, 10<sup>\u2212\u2002</sup>M, or 10<sup>\u221212</sup>M, and most preferably less than 10<sup>\u221213</sup>M, 10<sup>\u221214</sup>M, or 10<sup>\u221215</sup>M.</p>By \u201csubstantial sequence identity\u201d or \u201csubstantially identical\u201d is meant that a nucleic acid or amino acid sequence exhibits at least 50%, preferably 60%, 70%, 75%, or 80%, more preferably 85%, 90% or 95%, and most preferably 99% identity to a reference amino acid sequence (e.g., one or more of the sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOs:1-3 and 5-8). For amino acid sequences, the length of comparison sequences will generally be at least 5 amino acids, preferably at least 10 contiguous amino acids, more preferably at least 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 90, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, or 350 contiguous amino acids, and most preferably the full-length amino acid sequence. Sequence identity is typically measured using BLAST\u00ae (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) or BLAST\u00ae2 with the default parameters specified therein (see, Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410, 1990); and Tatiana et al., FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 174:247-250, 1999). This software program matches similar sequences by assigning degrees of homology to various substitutions, deletions, and other modifications. Conservative substitutions typically include substitutions within the following groups: glycine, alanine, valine, isoleucine, leucine; as"
