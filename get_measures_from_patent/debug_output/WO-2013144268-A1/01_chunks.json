    "sition comprises about 200 g dry matter per daily administered dose to a child of 1-3 years. According to an embodiment, the composition comprises about 300 g dry matter per daily administered dose to a child of 4-8 years. According to an embodiment, the composition comprises about 360 g per daily administered dose to a child of 9-13 years. According to an embodiment, the composition comprises about 400 g per daily administered dose to a human subject that is 14 years old or older. These amounts apply, in particular, if the composition is nutritionally complete and/or is nutritionally complete with respect to all macronutrients. </p> [001 15] According to an embodiment, the composition is not nutritionally complete, but is a supplement or a pharmaceutical composition, for example in the form of a tablet, pill, and so forth. In this case, the composition preferably has about 1 g to about 200 g per daily administered dose, about 1.5 g to about 100 g, preferably about 2-50 g, 3-40 g, 4-40 g, 5- 30 g, 6-20 g, 7-10 g per daily administered amount of the composition. Again the weight-amounts of the specific components of the composition (macro-, micronutrient, nucleotides, antioxidants and phytonutrient, in as far as applicable) may be determined from indications elsewhere in this specification with respect to daily administered doses. </p> [001 16] According to an embodiment, the composition comprises vitamin K. For example, the composition comprises any one selected from vitamin Ki (also known as phylloquinone, phytomenadione or phytonadione), vitamin K<sub>2</sub>, (a series of vitamers also known as menaquinones or menatetranones, see below), or synthetic vitamin K forms, such as vitamin K<sub>3</sub>, vitamin K4, vitamin K5, or combinations of the aforementioned. Preferably, the composition comprises vitamin K<sub>2</sub> and/or vitamin K . </p> [001 17] According to an embodiment, the composition comprises vitamin K<sub>2</sub>. Vitamin K<sub>2</sub> is a group of compounds called menaquinones (\"MK\") having side chains composed of a variable number of unsaturated isoprenoid residues generally designated as MK-n, where n specifies the number of isoprenoids. The most common MKs are MK-4 and MK-7. MK-4 is typically synthesized by animal organs and muscle, while MK-7 is typically synthesized by bacteria during fermentation. Accordingly, MK-7 is \n\n particularly abundant in fermented products including cheese, curd cheese and natto (fermented soybeans) and has a particularly long half- life when compared to vitamin Ki . Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that vitamin K<sub>2</sub> provides better absorption and more stable serum levels through a longer half-life. The improved bioavailability of vitamin K<sub>2</sub> to extrahepatic tissue may also allow for a greater impact on bone health (i.e. mineralization, microarchitecture and strength) during normal growth and development. Therefore, vitamin K<sub>2</sub> provides for a more potent form of the vitamin in which its enhanced bioavailability can impact bone health during normal growth and development. </p> [001 18] Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that administering exogenous vitamin K<sub>2</sub> as part of the composition of the invention will improve osteocalcin carboxylation and improve indices of bone health during normal growth and development in children. Additionally, vitamin K<sub>2</sub> supplementation can also promote bone growth and bone quality in pediatric patients with underlying medical conditions in which bone growth and bone quality may be compromised. As a result, administration of exogenous vitamin K<sub>2</sub> is believed to increase bone density and improves bone tissue microarchitecture in pediatric patients, thereby reducing the incidence for fracture risk. The effects of vitamin K<sub>2</sub> may be seen directly on bone quality such that this form of vitamin K modulates formation of proteins in the organic matrix of the bone involved in microarchitectural morphology,"
