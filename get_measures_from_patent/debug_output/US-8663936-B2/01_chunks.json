    "\u03bcL/well. Subsequently, cells are incubated with mixed dye solution for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. The mixed dye solution is prepared with External solution and consists of 10 \u03bcM CC2-DMPE (chlorocoumarin-2-dimyristoyl phosphatidylethanolamine), 2.4 \u03bcM DISBAC<sub>6</sub>(3) (bis-(1,3-dihexyl-thiobarbituric acid) trimethine oxonol), 0.5% \u03b2-cyclodextrin, 20 \u03bcg/ml pluronic F-127 and ESS Acid Yellow 17 (ESS AY-1 7). Thereafter, the cells are washed three times again with bath solution and then incubated with bath solution containing 0.5 mM ESS AY-17 and test compounds at desired concentrations for 10 min before assay.</p>A VIPR is equipped with instrumentation capable of electrical stimulation of cells expressing NaV1.3 (see U.S. Pat. No. 6,686,193). This allows manipulation of the membrane potential and modulates the NaV1.3 conductance. Sodium channels have brief (\u02dc1-3 ms) open times, so a train of electric field pulses is used to cycle the channel through open and closed conformations repeatedly. Membrane potential changes caused by the sodium influx through the channels is converted to optical signals using the Aurora FRET voltage sensitive dyes, described above. Cells stained with CC2-DMPE and DiSBAC<sub>6</sub>(3) are excited at 405 nm. The instrument is able to continually monitor the fluorescent output at two wavelengths for FRET measurement. Fluorescence responses are obtained at two wavelengths, 460 nm for CC2-DMPE and 580 nm for DiSBAC<sub>6</sub>(3).</p>The IC50 values of the tested compounds may be determined using an assay such as the one set forth above or any other conventional assay that measures sodium channel activity. Compounds that are effective in such in vitro assays may be tested in subsequent in vivo assays as described below.</p>Such assays are highly amenable to automation and high throughput. High throughput screening of compounds is described in WO 84/03564.</p>Of particular interest in this format will be the screening of a variety of different Nav1.3 splice variant protein mutants. These mutants, including deletion, truncation, insertion and substitution mutants, will help identify which domains are involved with the functional channel forming activity of the Nav1.3 splice variant of the invention. Once this region(s) or amino acids particularly important to the channel forming properties of the Nav1.3 splice variant protein that has the sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 has been determined, it will be possible to identify which of these mutants have altered structure but retain some or all of the biological functions of the sodium channel. As noted above, SEQ ID NO:2 comprises a 33-amino acid (NVSQASM SSRMVPGLPANGKMHSTVDCNGVVSL; SEQ ID NO:3) that starts at residue 624 of the NAV 1.3 splice variant of the present invention. This region is part of the linker between domain 1 and domain 2 of the sodium channel alpha 1 subunit. PICA phosphorylation sites of the sodium channel are located in this region and are close to thi",
    "n to predict whether an amino acid substitution affects protein function and can distinguish between functionally neutral and deleterious amino acid changes in mutagenesis studies (Ng and Henikoff, Nucieic Acid. Res. 31(13): 3812-3814, 2003)</p>Purified Nav1.3 splice variant protein or its binding agent can be coated directly onto plates for use in the aforementioned drug screening techniques. However, non-neutralizing antibodies to the polypeptide can be used to immobilize the polypeptide to a solid phase. Also, fusion proteins containing a reactive region (preferably a terminal region) may be used to link the Nav1.3 protein active region to a solid phase.</p>Other forms of in vitro assays include those in which functional readouts are taken. For example cells in which a Nav1.3 protein polypeptide is expressed can be treated with a candidate substance. In such assays, the substance would be formulated appropriately, given its biochemical nature, and contacted with the cell. Depending on the assay, culture may be required. The cell may then be examined by virtue of a number of different physiologic assays, as discussed above. Alternatively, molecular analysis may be performed in which the cells characteristics are examined. This may involve assays such as those for protein expression, enzyme function, substrate utilization, mRNA expression (including differential display of whole cell or polyA RNA) and others. Yet another assay format that can be contemplated is the use of a binding assay with a suitably labeled ligand that binds to the expressed protein. An example of such an assay would be the displacement by a small molecule of a radiolabeled or fluorescently labeled ligand from the expressed Nav1.3 protein. Such an assay can be used to identify potential small molecule modulators of the channel especially if the site where the labeled ligand binds is known to affect channel activity or regulation.</p>d. In Vivo Assays.</p>The present invention also encompasses the use of various animal models. In exemplary embodiments, the in vivo assays are set up to identify agents that modulate the sodium channel and are effective as analgesic or anti-inflammatory agents. The ability of an agent or a combination of agents to treat pain can be determined using known pharmacological models (for example see Kim, S. H. and Chung, J. M., Pain, 1992, 50, 355-363), or using models that are similar to known models. For example, to test baseline pain responses, tests such as mechanical withdrawal frequencies by application of different forces of calibrated von Frey monofilaments (mN: 0.24, 1.47, 4.33, 8.01, 23.69, 40.31) (Stoelting, Wood Dale, Ill.) to the plantar hind paw surface, or thermal withdrawal latencies after the application of radiant heat to the plantar hind paw surface may be used (Mansikka et al., Exp Neurol 162: 343-349, 2000; Tao et al., Neuroscience 98: 201-206, 2000). Mechanical withdrawal frequencies are assessed by applying calibrated von Frey monofilaments 0.24 and 4.33 mN to the plantar hind paw surface (Fairbanks et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 97: 10584-10589 2000; Mansikka et al., Exp Neurol 162: 343-349, 2000).</p>Male Sprague-Dawley rats are pre-screened to determine their baseline 50% withdrawal threshold using a set of von Frey filaments. The 50% withdrawal threshold for mechanical stimulation to the hind paw is determined by the up-down method described by Dixon W. J., Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol., 1980, 20, 441-462. Briefly, 8 von Frey filaments with approximately equal logarithmic incremental (0.22) bending forces are chosen (von Frey numbers: 3.65, 3.87, 4.10, 4.31, 4.52, 4.74, 4.92, and 5.16; equivalent to: 0.45, 0.74, 1.26, 2.04, 3.31, 5.50, 8.32, and 14.45 g). A von Frey filament is applied perpendicularly to the plantar surface with sufficient force to bend it slightly and held for 3-5 seconds. An abrupt withdrawal of the foot during stimulation or immediately after the removal of stimulus is considered a positive response.</p>Whenever there is a positive or negative response, the next weaker or stronger filament is applied, respectively. The test is continued until six stimuli after the first change in response has been obtained. The pattern of positive and negative responses may then be converted into a 50% threshold value using various formulae known to those of skill in the art. One such formula is: 50% threshold=10<sup>(X+kd)</sup>/10<sup>4</sup>, where X=the value of the final von Frey filament used (in log units), k=the tabular value for the pattern of positive/negative responses [obtained from Dixon, Annu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol 20:441-462], and d=the mean difference between stimuli in log units (0.22). In the cases where continuous positive or negative responses are observed all the way out to the end of the stimulus spectrum, values of 0.3 g or 15.0 g are assigned, respectively. For ED<sub>50 </sub>calculations, a linear regression is determined for responses one either side of the 50% reversal and then an approximation is determined based upon the value which intersects the 50% point.</p>Other in vivo methods of testing pain include hotplate analgesia meter determinations. Such hotplate methods evaluate the reaction time of mice (or rats) dropped onto a heated surface and confronted with a heat stimulus applied to their plantar surface. When an analgesic agent is administered to the animals, their reaction time is markedly increased. Such methods may be assessed using e.g., the SDI Hotplate Analgesia Meter (San Diego Instruments, San Diego, Calif., USA).</p>Treatment of animals with test compounds will involve the administration of the compound, in an appropriate form, to the animal. Administration will be by any route that can be utilized for clinical or non-clinical purposes, including but not limited to oral, nasal, buccal, rectal, vaginal or topical. Alternatively, administration may b"
