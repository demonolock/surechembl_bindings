    "a strong DNA-damage response, triggering of apoptosis and/or mitotic catastrophe may take place in Hodgkin lymphoma cells according to their sensitivity to bendamustine. The compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof represents an agent of great potential advantage in the treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma based on the presented data.</p>Example 10 Combination Therapy with Brentuximab Vedotin1.56 \u03bcM of EDO-S101 was administered to two Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines, the bendamustine na\u00efve cell line L1236 and the bendamustine resistant cell line R100. In a second experiment, Brentuximab Vedotin was administered at a concentration of 3.12 \u03bcg/ml to the L1236 cell line and at a concentration of 0.39 \u03bcg/ml to the R100 cell line. Finally, in a third experiment EDO-S101 and Brentuximab Vedotin were administered in combination to each of the two cell lines at the same concentrations that they were administered in the monotherapy experiments. The results showing % survival of the lymphoma cell lines against a control versus times are as shown in FIGS. 12A and 12B.</p>In the na\u00efve L1236 cell line, EDO-S101 alone activated cell cycle checkpoint proteins and induced cellular and gene expression changes compatible with the triggering of apoptosis. In the bendamustine resistant R100 cell line, EDO-S101 alone was found to correct the constitutive ATM/ATR unbalance by upregulating ATR and downregulating ATM transcripts.</p>Most importantly, it was found that EDO-S101 at sub-IC50 levels is synergistic with Brentuximab Vedotin in inducing cell death of L1236 cells and furthermore that at sub-IC concentrations EDO-S101 allows low doses of Brentuximab Vedotin (typically 10-fold lower than IC50) to exert a considerable cyctotoxic effect on bendamustine resistant R100 cells.</p>"
