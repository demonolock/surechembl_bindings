    " some embodiments, instead of coating the well with the antigen, the binding agent or antibody can be coated to the well and a second antibody conjugated to a detectable compound can be added following the addition of the antigen to the coated well. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected as well as other variations of ELISAs known in the art.</p>In another example, the specific binding of an antibody to human VEGF and/or human DLL4 may be determined using FACS. A FACS screening assay may comprise generating a cDNA construct that expresses an antigen as a fusion protein, transfecting the construct into cells, expressing the antigen on the surface of the cells, mixing the binding agent or antibody with the transfected cells, and incubating for a period of time. The cells bound by the binding agent or antibody may be identified by using a secondary antibody conjugated to a detectable compound (e.g., PE-conjugated anti-Fc antibody) and a flow cytometer. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to optimize the signal detected as well as other variations of FACS that may enhance screening (e.g., screening for blocking antibodies).</p>The binding affinity of an antibody or other binding-agent to an antigen (e.g., VEGF or DLL4) and the off-rate of an antibody-antigen interaction can be determined by competitive binding assays. One example of a competitive binding assay is a radioimmunoassay comprising the incubation of labeled antigen (e.g., <sup>3</sup>H or <sup>125</sup>I), or fragment or variant thereof, with the antibody of interest in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled antigen followed by the detection of the antibody bound to the labeled antigen. The affinity of the antibody for the antigen and the binding off-rates can be determined from the data by Scatchard plot analysis. In some embodiments, Biacore kinetic analysis is used to determine the binding on and off rates of antibodies or agents that bind an antigen (e.g., VEGF or DLL4). Biacore kinetic analysis comprises analyzing the binding and dissociation of antibodies from chips with immobilized antigen (e.g., VEGF or DLL4) on their surface.</p>In certain embodiments, the invention provides a VEGF-binding agent (e.g., an antibody) that specifically binds human VEGF, wherein the VEGF-binding agent (e.g., an antibody) comprises one, two, three, four, five, and/or six of the CDRs of antibody 219R45 (see Table 1).
