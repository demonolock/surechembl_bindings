    "l composition and this pharmaceutical composition of preparation.</p>Pharmaceutical composition is the preparation that contains one or more active component and one or more excipient, carrier, stabilizing agent or extender, is fit to give diagnostic result or the therapeutic effect of patient with expectation.</p>Operate with being convenient to for bin stability, pharmaceutical composition can be mixed with lyophilizing (being lyophilization) or vacuum drying powder, reformulates with saline or water before giving the patient.Alternatively, pharmaceutical composition can be mixed with aqueous solution.Pharmaceutical composition can contain protein active ingredients.Unfortunately, albumen may be difficult to stablize, and it is preceding preparing, reformulate in (if desired) process and lay up period that protein-contg pharmaceutical composition is used, and causes the loss of loss of proteins and/or protein active.Because albuminous degeneration, degraded, dimerization and/or polymerization may produce stability problem.Various excipient successfully have been used for attempting protein active composition with stabilizing pharmaceutical composition to some extent as albumin and gelatin.In addition, cryoprotective agent such as ethanol have been used to reduce albuminous degeneration under freeze dried freezing conditions.</p>Albumin</p>Albumin is the albumen that is rich in the little blood plasma.The human serum albumin has the molecular weight of about 69 kilodaltons (kD), has been used as the non-active ingredient in the pharmaceutical composition, wherein the stabilizing agent of the carrier of bulk and some protein active composition in its useful as drug compositions.</p>In the multistep process for preparation of pharmaceutical composition and during the pharmaceutical composition later stage that the is made into reformulation, all can present the stabilization function of albumin in pharmaceutical composition.Therefore, albumin can be given in the pharmaceutical composition protein active ingredients with stability, by for example, (1) reduces protein active composition and surperficial adhesion (so-called \" viscosity \"), as the surface of laboratory glassware, container, reformulate the bottle and the inner surface that is used for the syringe of injectable pharmaceutical compositions of pharmaceutical composition.The adhesion energy on protein active composition and surface causes active ingredient loss and remainingly retains the degeneration of protein active composition, the two all reduce the active component that exists in the pharmaceutical composition gross activity and; (2) reduce generable active component degeneration in the low dilution factor formulations prepared from solutions process of active component.</p>Except the protein active composition in can stabilizing pharmaceutical composition, albumin also has injection when giving the patient, usually insignificant immunogenic advantage.Have as can be known immunogeni",
    "an Botulinum toxin Type B.And, determined that the Botulinum toxin Type B of 480U/kg dosage is nontoxic to Primates, this dosage is that botulinum toxin type A is to Primates LD\n          <sub>50</sub>12 times.Botulinum toxin and the bonded affinity of cholinergic motor neuron are obviously high, are displaced to neuron and block the release of presynaptic acetylcholine.\n        </p>It excessively is in the clinical treatment of neuromuscular disorder of feature that Botulinum toxin has been used to treat with skeletal muscle movement.Botulinum toxin type A was used for essential blepharospasm more than 12 years old, stravismus and hemifacial spasm patient's treatment in 1989 by food and drug administration's approval.The clinical effectiveness of periphery intramuscular injection botulinum toxin type A is usually seen in the week after injection.Sx (type that promptly relaxes myoparalysis) typical duration can be about three months after the intramuscular injection botulinum toxin type A separately.</p>Although all botulinum toxin serotype obviously suppress the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine of neuromuscular junction, this is that they are by influencing different neurosecretion albumen and/or cutting these albumen in different loci and carry out.Botulinum toxin A is the zinc endopeptidase of the peptide bond of energy specificity hydrolysis endocytic vesicle associated protein SNAP-25.Bacillus botulinus E type also cuts the SNAP (SNAP-25) of 25 kilodaltons (kD), but compares with botulinum toxin type A, points to the different aminoacids sequence in this albumen.Botulinum toxin B, D, F and G type act on vesicle associated protein (VAMP is also referred to as synaptobrevin), and each serotype is cut this albumen in different sites.At last, shown Botulinum toxin C\n          <sub>1</sub>Type cutting syntaxin and SNAP-25.The difference of these mechanism of action can influence the relative efficiency and/or the persistent period of various botulinum toxin serotype effects.\n        </p>For seven known botulinum toxin serotype, the molecular weight of Botulinum toxin protein molecular is about 150kD.What is interesting is that Botulinum toxin is to be discharged with the complex form that comprises 150kD Botulinum toxin protein molecular and related nontoxic protein by Clostridium botulinum.Therefore, Clostridium botulinum can produce 900kD, 500kD and 300kD botulinum toxin type A complex.Botulinum toxin B and C\n          <sub>1</sub>Type be it seems the only 500kD complex form that produces.Botulinum toxin D type produces with 300kD and 500kD complex form.At last, Botulinum toxin E and F type are with only nearly 300kD complex form generation.Think that complex (being that molecular weight surpasses about 150kD) contains nontoxic hemagglutinin and nontoxic and nontoxic non-hemagglutinin.These two nontoxic proteins (can comprise the related neural toxin complex with botulinum toxin molecules) can provide the stability and the protecti"
