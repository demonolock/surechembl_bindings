{"raw_mentions": "In this test preferred compounds as described above have IC50 values below 1000 nM; more preferred compounds have IC50 values below 100 nM. \nMost preferred compounds have IC50 values below 10 nM.\nCompounds as described above have IC50 values below 1000 nM; preferred compounds have IC50 values below 100 nM. \nMore preferred compounds have IC50 values below 10 nM. \nThe amount of Cortisol produced in this assay was determined using a commercially available, ELJSA-based Cortisol- detection kit (Distributed by Assay Design, Inc.). Inhibitors were characterized by there IC50 values, e.g. the concentration at which the production of Cortisol was 50% reduced.\nThe assay was stopped by heating to 80\u00b0C (5 min.) and by addition of the inhibitor Carbenoxolone (1 uM)."}
