    "s depends not only on circulating steroid concentrations and the cellular expression of receptors, but also on intracellular enzymes that critically determine to which extent glucocorticoids gain access to receptors in an active forms. 1 lbeta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases ( 1 lbeta- HSD's) catalyze the interconversion of the principal active 11-hydroxy-glucocorticoid (Cortisol in men) and their inactive 11-keto metabolites (cortisone in men).</p>\n  The enzyme 1 lbeta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (llbeta-HSDl) inter- converts inactive into active glucocorticoids, thereby playing a major role in local modulation of cellular agonist concentration and thus activation of corticosteroid receptors in target tissues. In a recent study made by F. Hoffmann-La Roche differences in gene expression in lean and obese men were analyzed using gene array technology in order to identify specific changes in gene expression that might be associated with insulin resistance or altered metabolism. This study revealed that the mRNAfor llbeta-HSDl is approximately two-fold up regulated in adipose tissue in obese individuals. Moreover, overexpressing llbeta-HSDl in adipocytes of mice led to visceral obesity and to a syndrome-Xlike phenotype (Masuzaki H. et al., Science. 2001 Dec 7; 294(5549) :2166- 70.). \n\nTaken together, these data very strongly support an important role of llbeta-HSDl in the induction of obesity and the impairment of glucose homeostasis and lipid parameters. Thus, selective inhibition of this enzyme could lower blood glucose levels in Type 2 diabetic patients, normalize elevated lipid parameters and/or reduce weight in obese subjects .</p>\n  The first pharmacological indication that llbeta-HSDl inhibition in men might have beneficial effects were obtained by using carbenoxolone, an anti-ulcer drug which inhibits both llbeta-HSDl and the related enzyme llbeta-HSD2. Treatment with carbenoxolone led to an increase in insulin sensitivity indicating that that inhibition of llbeta-HSDl may reduce cellular Cortisol levels and therefore minimizing some of its deleterious effects. (Walker et al. 1995; J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 80, 31155-3159).</p>\n  llbeta-HSDl is expressed in many tissues including liver, adipose tissue, vascular smooth muscles, pancreas and brain. Its activity is dependent on NADP(H) and it has a relatively low affinity for its substrate (compared to llbeta-HSD2). 11 beta-HSDl in tissue homogenates and when purified is bidirectional, exhibiting both 1 lbeta-dehydrogenase and llbeta- reductase reactions, with greater stability of the dehydrogenase activity (P.M. Stewart and Z.S. Krozowski, Vitam. Horm. 57 (1999), pp. 249-324). However, when the enzyme activity is tested in intact cells, the 1 lbeta- reductase activity predominates, which regenerates active glucocorticoids from inert 11-keto forms. Such glucocorticoid regeneration will increase effective intracellular glucocorticoid levels and thereby amplifying glucocorticoid activity. It is this elevated cellular Cortisol concentration that might lead to increased hepatic glucose production, adipocyte differentiation and insulin resistance.</p>\n  Inhibition of llbeta-HSDl should not only reduce the typical Syndrome-X/ Diabetes associated symptoms, but it should also be save and without major side effect. Studies with the unspecific inhibitor carbenoxolone highlight the importance of developing specific llbeta-HSDl inhibitors. The inhibition of the llbeta-HSD2 enzyme is badly tolerated and results in increased blood pressure. In contrast inhibition of llbeta- HSDl should be well tolerated since llbeta-HSDl knockout mice were found be healthy and to resist hyperglycemia provoked by obesity or stress (Kotelevtsev Y. et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1997 Dec 23;94(26):14924-9). Similar upon starvation these mice had attenuated activation of key hepatic enzymes that are involved in gluconeogenesis. In addition, these mice had improved lipid and lipoprotein profiles suggesting that inhibition of HSDl might be highly efficacious and safe. Recent reports indicate that llbeta-HSDl \n\ninhibitors might also be beneficial to reduce high blood pressure (Masuzaki H. et al., J Clin Invest. 2003 July;112(l):83-90; Rauz S. et al., QJM. 2003 July;96(7):481-90) to improve cognition (Sandeep TC. et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 2004 Apr. 27;101(17):6734-9) or to improve Alzheimer associated deficits. Taken together llbeta-HSDl inhibition might be a save and efficacious approach to treat symptoms of diabetes, obesity and other diseases.</p>\n  The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters are novel and have valuable pharmacological properties. In particular they are 1 Ib-HSDl inhibitors (T2D) and they display selectivity against the related llbeta-HSD2 enzyme. Therefore the compounds which are specific llbeta-HSDl inhibitors (T2D) represent an approach to e.g. lower blood glucose levels and normalize lipid parameters in Type 2 diabetic patients by modulating the local concentration of the active glucocorticoid Cortisol in target tissue (liver, adipose tissue).</p>\n  The compounds of the present invention can be used in the prophylaxis and/or treatment of metabolic disorders, obesity, dyslipidemiae, hypertension and/or diabetes, particularly diabetes Type II.</p>\n  The compounds of this invention can further be used in the prophylaxis and/or treatment of high ocular eye pressure, cognition, Alzheimer and/or neurodegeneration.</p>\n  Further, the compounds of this invention can be used for promoting wound healing, particularly by topical application. Moreover, the compounds of the present invention can be used to improve cognitive impairement, particularly impairement developed with age, and improvement of memory.</p>\n  Objects of the present invention are the compounds of formula I and their aforementioned salts and esters per se and their use as therapeutically acti",

The resulting pellet containing the microsomal fraction was again taken up into storage buffer and aliquots were kept frozen in liquid Nitrogen until use.</p>\n  Generation of stable cell lines expressing llbeta-HSDl:</p>\n  The same construct used for transient expression of human llbeta-HSDl was also used to establish cell lines stably expressing the protein. Briefly, (HEK293) cells were transfected with llbeta-HSDl construct using the lipofectamine reagent (Gibco BRL) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Two days after transfection, geneticin selection (0.8 mg/ml) was initiated and several stable clones were isolated. One clone was further used for pharmacological characterization.</p>\n  Microsome Assay \n\nMicrosomes isolated from HEK293 cells transiently expressing human llbeta-HSDl (for details see above) were incubated in assay buffer (100 mM NaCl; ImM EDTA; ImM EGTA; ImM MgCl; 250 mM Sucrose; 20 mM Tris pH 7.4; Cortisone 50-20OnM and NADPH ImM) together with different concentrations of test substances. After 60 min. of incubation at 37<sup>0</sup>C the assay was stopped by heating to 8O<sup>0</sup>C (5 min.) and by addition of the inhibitor Carbenoxolone (1 uM). The amount of Cortisol produced in this assay was determined using a commercially available, ELJSA-based Cortisol- detection kit (Distributed by Assay Design, Inc.). Inhibitors were characterized by there IC50 values, e.g. the concentration at which the production of Cortisol was 50% reduced.</p>\n  In this test preferred compounds as described above have IC50 values below 1000 nM; more preferred compounds have IC50 values below 100 nM. Most preferred compounds have IC50 values below 1OnM.</p>\n  Cellular Assay</p>\n  To measure the effect of inhibitors in intact cells HEK293 cells stably expressing human llbeta-HSDl (see above) were cultivated in 96 well plates in DMEM. First inhibitors and 60 min later Cortisone was added to the cells. After 60 min of incubation at 37<sup>0</sup>C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere part of the medium was removed and the conversion from Cortisone to Cortisol was measured using a commercially available EOSA kit (Distributed by Assay Design, Inc.).</p>\n  Results obtained in the microsome assay using representative compounds of the invention as the test compounds are shown in the following table:</p>\n  \n Compounds as described above have IC<sub>5</sub>O values below 1000 nM; preferred compounds have IC<sub>5</sub>O values below 100 nM. More preferred compounds have IC<sub>5</sub>O values below 10 nM. These results have been obtained by using the foregoing test.</p>\n  The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters can be used as medicaments (e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations). The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered internally, such as orally (e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatin capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions), nasally (e.g. in the form of nasal sprays) or rectally (e.g. in the form of suppositories). However, the administration can also be effected parentally, such as intramuscularly or intravenously (e.g."
