    "n Amicon cell. The final volume of the retained solution was 65 ml, yielding 0.582 g ChOS (Yield=33%). The total permeate volume was 970 ml. Both total permeate and final retentate were analysed by P4 Biogel chromatography and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry as described in Example 4 The final retentate was lyophilised and referred to as G050421 UF.</p>A purified Chitinase A preparation from S. marcescens was used as a standard Family 18 chitinase, and 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-N,N\u2032-triacetylchitotrioside (4-MU-A3), a chitin tetramer (A4) analogue, was used as a standard chitinase substrate.</p>The standard Chitinase A solution was 0.5 nM (500 \u03bcM) in 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4 (Chit-A sol.) and the substrate solution was 40 \u03bcM 4-MU-A3 in 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4.</p>Different concentration of each pure ChOS homologue (usually 0, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400 and 800 \u03bcM) was made in the substrate buffer. For the assay, 25 \u03bcl of the Chit-A solution was mixed with 25 \u03bcl of the substrate/blocking solution, incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 10 min. The reaction was stopped with 1.95 ml 0.2 M sodium bicarbonate buffer (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>). The formation of the product, 4-Methylumbelliferone (4-MU) was read for each reaction in a Perken-Elmer LS 50B Fluorometer. The excitation wavelength was 380 nm (5 nm adjusting slit) and the emission wavelength was 460 nm (4 nm adjusting slit). Each reaction was read in triplicate. To estimate blocking, 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was calculated for each ChOS homologue, using non-linear fit, f=y0+a*exp(\u2212b*x), where x equals specific activity of the chitinase and f equals oligosaccharide concentration (\u03bcM). Affinity of each homologue was calculated as inverted IC50. The formula used was 1/IC50*1000.</p>Results and ConclusionEven tough the chitinase A has an optimal activity at pH 5.5, the pH for the blocking experiments was adjusted at pH 7.4. This was done in order to free the amine groups of ChOS from protons, since earlier pilot experiments performed at pH 5.5 indicated low blocking activities of the ChOS homologues. Also this pH better resembles the physiological pH of blood and other physiological fluids, better reflecting the behaviour of the oligosaccharides in the human body.</p>FIG. 11 shows typical ChOS blocking of the chitinase activity. The resulting ICS) was calculated 17 \u03bcM for the A4D2 homologue. Table 5 summarises the DP, homologue, the IC50, the calculated affinity and the sequences for all homologues tested. FIG. 12 shows the calculated affinity of each homologue tested. FIG. 13 shows the same as FIG. 12 as well as all sequences (isobars) comprising each homologue. Considering the blocking activity of different homologues two main rules can be drawn. The blocking is stronger as the DP is increased and at the same time the more acetylated homologues (more A units per molecule) show higher affinity. Therefore D16, D9 and D12 are all poor blockers. A4D2, A4D3, A5D7 and A6D) (DP 6-12) showed the strongest blocking. These homologues can therefore be considered to possess the highest bioactivity due to their apparent affinity to the chitinase active side. DP12 (A5D7) shows the highest affinity and at DP15 (A5D7) the affinity is not significantly increased (FIGS. 12 and 13). The homooligomer A6 was cleaved by the chitinase A into A3, A2 and A1 as judged by MALDI-TOF.</p>However, the Chitinase A did not cleave any of the hetero-oligomers tested under the assay conditions (pH 5.5 and pH 7.4), as judged by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, indicating good biostability of the homologues. The reason for this high biostability is the complete hydrolysis of the substrate, by a Family 18 chitinase during the production of the ChOS.</p>When the un-fractionated ChOS preparations were tested in the same enzyme system, the IC50 was 70 \u03bcg/ml for G040823 (FIG. 14), 105 \u03bcg/ml for G050421 and 67 \u03bcg/ml for the ultra-filtrated G050421UF. This demonstrates that the method can be used to evaluate blocking activity and biostability of homologues in ChOS mixtures and does not require fractionation into homologues prior to analysis. Therefore, this method can be used as an evaluation of the average blocking activity of a ChOS preparation comprising a mixture of different homologues of hetero chitooligosaccharides. Such an evaluation would give an indication of the average binding affinity to the active site of the enzyme and the average biostability of the comprised homologues.</p>TABLE\u20035Degree,\u2003of\u2003polymerisation\u2003(DP),\u2003homologues,\u2003inhibition\u2003concentration\u2003(IC50),calculated\u2003affinity\u2003(CA)\u2003and\u2003sequences\u2003of\u2003the\u2003chitooligosadcharides\u2003tested,DPHomologueIC50CA*Sequences6D619800.5DDDDDD\u2003100% 9D9NB*0DDDDDDDDD\u2003100% 12D12NB*0DDDDDDDDDDDD\u2003100% 3A2DNB*0DAA\u2003100% 4A2D213870.7DDAA\u200392%,\u2003ADDA\u20035%,\u2003DADA\u20033% 3A32194.4AAA\u2003100% 5A3D296.710.3DADAA\u200378%,\u2003DDAAA\u200319%,\u2003ADDAA\u20032% 6A3D3<sup>1</sup>31.331.9DADDAA\u200365%,\u2003DDADAA\u200335%A3D3<sup>2</sup>42.723.4DADDAA\u200357%,\u2003DDADAA\u200315%,\u2003ADDDAA\u200314%,\u2003DDDAAA\u20037%,ADADDA\u20033%,\u2003DAADDA\u20032% 6A4D217.056.8ADADAA\u200330%,\u2003DADAAA\u200325%,\u2003AADDAA\u200318%,\u2003ADDAAA\u200317%,DAADAA\u20037%,\u2003DDAAAA\u20033% 7A4D311.288.0ADADDAA\u200330%,\u2003DADDAAA\u200317%,\u2003DADADAA\u200316%,\u2003DAADDAA\u200313%,ADDADAA\u200313%,\u2003AADDDAA\u20034%,\u2003ADDDAAA\u20034%,\u2003DDADAAA\u20034%,DDAADAA\u20032% 9A4D511.388.5DDADDADAA,\u2003DDADADDAA,\u2003DADDDADAA,\u2003DADDADDAA 12A5D77.5133.0DDADDADDADAA,\u2003DDADDADADDAA,\u2003DDADADDADDAA,DADDDADADDAA,\u2003DADDADDADDDA,\u2003DDADADDDADAA,DADDADDDADAA,\u2003DADDDADDADAA 15A6D98.0125.8DDADDADDADDADAA,\u2003DDADDADDADADDAA,\u2003DDADDADADDADDAA,DDADADDDADADDAA,\u2003DDADADDADDADDDA,\u2003DDADDADADDDADAA,DDADADDADDDADAA,\u2003DDADADDDADDADAA,*CA = calculated affinity, 1/IC50*1000*NB = no blocking foundA3D3<sup>1 </sup>from G020418A3D3<sup>2 </sup>from G020218</p>Example 5Binding of Heterooligosaccharides to the 39-kDa Human Cartilage Glycoprotein (HC gp-39)As HC gp-39 is a chitinase-derived protein, chitin oligomers (besides the polymer chitin) show the strongest affinities to this protein. On the other hand, chitin oligomers are rapidly cleaved by active Family 18 chitinases that are also found in the human body. Heterochitooligosaccharides (composed of A and D units) such as the T-ChOS compositions, possess a significantly higher biostability than chitin oligomers (only A unitsor homooligosaccharides). Thus, the objectives of the present work were to investigate how much the affinity of ChOS to HC gp-39 is influenced by the F<sub>A </sub>and moreover by the DP of heterooligosaccharides.</p>Materials and MethodsQualitative and Quantitative Sequence Analysis of Heterochitooligosaccharides was performed as previously described (Example 4).</p>Affinity StudiesThe affinities of non-covalent complexes between ChOS and HC gp-39 were analysed making use of the change of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the protein under binding conditions. The change of fluorescence intensity is caused by ligand-induced changes of the solvent cover of tryptophan residues and positively correlated with the sugar concentration.</p>HC gp-39 was dissolved in 25 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.4 containing 1 mM dithiothreitol to a final concentration of 1.00 \u03bcM (protei",
    " Different concentrations of homologues were prepared in 25 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.4 containing 1 mM dithiothreitol (sugar solution). For each homologue 4 different concentrations were prepared: solution I 1.3-2.0 \u03bcM, solution II 6.5-16.0 \u03bcM, solution III 52.0-80.0 \u03bcM and solution IV 130.0-200.0 \u03bcM (the concentrations differed between the homologues). For the assay, 50 \u03bcl of the protein solution and 50 \u03bcl of each sugar solution (solutions I-IV) were preincubated separately at 25\u00b0 C. in a thermoshaker for 15 min. Afterwards 50 \u03bcL of the thermostatted protein solution was mixed with 50 \u03bcL of the sugar solution (solutions I-IV in succession). The mixture was incubated for 7 min at 25\u00b0 C. in a thermoshaker. The fluorescence was read for each reaction in a Perkin-Elmer LS 50B fluorescence spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer, \u00dcberlingen, Germany). The excitation wavelength was 295 nm (5 nm adjusting slit) and the emission wavelength 340 nm (10 nm adjusting slit) with a cut-off at 290 nm. Each reaction was measured in triplicate.</p>Calculation of Dissociation ConstantsFrom the row fluorescence data the fluorescence of the blank was subtracted.

Table 6 shows the sequence compositions of ChOS tested.</p>The affinities of complexes between ChOS and HC gp-39 were analysed using the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the protein. The change of fluorescence intensity is depending on the sugar concentration and explained by a rearrangement of solvent molecules covering the surface of tryptophan under non-binding conditions.<sup>24 </sup>The concentration-dependent fluorescence data were fitted by non-linear regression to a one-site saturation model (SigmaPlot\u00ae program, see FIG. 15). The dissociation constants found for D<sub>6</sub>, D<sub>3</sub>A<sub>3</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>A<sub>4</sub>, A<sub>6</sub>, and D<sub>5</sub>A<sub>6 </sub>were all in the \u03bcmolar range (FIG. 16).</p>As expected, the values for the dissociation constants are decreasing with increasing F<sub>A </sub>of ChOS. The decrease of the dissociation constants with increasing F<sub>A </sub>for the series of DP6 homologues (D<sub>6</sub>, D<sub>3</sub>A<sub>3</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>A<sub>4 </sub>and A<sub>6</sub>) is not a linear function.

The affinity increases with increasing F<sub>A </sub>and DP even with increasing number of D units but constant number of A units. For the series of DP 6 homologues a 50% decrease of F<sub>A </sub>(A<sub>6</sub>-D<sub>3</sub>A<sub>3</sub>) causes only 9.2% decrease of affinity. Thus, ChOS of F<sub>A </sub>0.5 to 0.75 are the optimal binding partners of HC gp-39 in the human body. They recover 90+% of the maximum binding capacity and contain enough D units (and thus D-D, D-A. A-D bonds) to show a significantly increased biostability in the human body. These compositions provide optimal therapeutic activity and are therefore herein refer"
