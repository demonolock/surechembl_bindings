    "itinated on DNA by the CUL4A-DDB1-DDB2 E3 ligase, and subsequently de- ubiquitinated, rather than undergoing proteasomal-dependent degradation (Sugasawa et al., Cell, 121: 387-400 (2005)). The physiological role of XPC ubiquitination on GG-NER has yet to be determined. Therefore, the effect of CUL4A ablation on XPC binding to chromatin and modification by ubiquitin upon UV irradiation was assessed. Since the available XPC antibodies were unable to detect ubiquitinated mouse XPC in MEFs, CUL4A was depleted by lentiviral shRNA in human HCTl 16 cells. As shown in FIG. 4E, the association of XPC with chromatin increased upon CUL4A silencing by lentiviral shRNA, consistent with higher XPC levels available in the absence of CuUa (FIG. 4B). Furthermore, CUL4A depletion led to a dramatic inhibition of XPC ubiquitination on chromatin post-UV (FIG. 4E). Collectively, these results demonstrated a specific role of \n\n CUL4A in controlling XPC levels under normal conditions and XPC ubiquitination on chromatin in response to UV irradiation. Moreover, CUL4A was primarily responsible for governing the ubiquitination of DDB2 and XPC, while CUL4B played a lesser, if any, role in these processes.</p>[0111] Thee results of this example reflected the enhanced stability of DDB2, p21, and XPC in CuUa deficient cells.</p>EXAMPLE 3</p>[0112] This example demonstrates enhanced UV-damaged DNA binding (UV-DDB) and global genomic repair (GGR) activities in CuUa deficient cells. [0113] For the damaged DNA binding assay of UV-DDB activity, 2 \u03bcg of whole cell extract was incubated with a <sup>32</sup>P-labeled DNA probe that was UV -irradiated at 5000 J/m<sup>2</sup>, and binding was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Chen et al., J. Biol. Chem., 276: 48175-48182 (2001)).</p>[0114] The GGR ELISA assay of CPD and 6-4PP removal was performed as previously described (Chen et al., 2006) in primary CuUa <sup>A</sup> (ko-4a scm-4b), CuUb<sup>m</sup> (f/f-4a sh-4b), and control CuU J<sup>1</sup>^ (f/f-4a scm-4b) MEFs (FIG. 7B, ko, knockout; k/d, knockdown; scm, scramble). Briefly, exponentially growing MEF cells were irradiated with 10 J/m<sup>2</sup> UV-C (254 nm) and either harvested immediately (0 hr) or allowed to repair for the duration indicated in FIG. 7B. Genomic DNA was isolated and quantified via liquid scintillation and fluorometric measurements of Hoechst-stained DNA. Denatured genomic DNA was fixed to each well of protamine sulfate-coated 96-well plates and sequentially incubated with monoclonal antibody specific for 6-4PPs (64M-2, 1 :5000) or CPDs (1 :5000), biotin-F(ab')2 fragment of anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (1 :2000, Zymed) and peroxidase-Streptavidin (1 :10,000, Zymed) for 30 min at 37\u00b0 C. The wells were washed with PBS-Tween and 0.1 M citrate- phosphate buffer and incubated with the substrate solution (0.1 M citrate-phosphate buffer, 0.1 mg/mL tetramethylbenzidine [TMB], 0.03% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) at room temperature for 30 min.

    "at a dominant negative (DN) CUL4 enhances NER in vitro.</p>[0126] HCTl 16 cells were infected with a control adenovirus or an adenovirus comprising a gene encoding a DN-CUL4 (SEQ ID NO: 18). Cells were then irradiated with</p>10 J/m<sup>2</sup> of UV-C. Genomic DNA was collected at 0 hr, 4 hr, 8 hr, and 24 hr and probed for</p>CPD lesions as described in Example 3. The rate of NER activity was then calculated as the rate of CPD repair as a function of time.</p>[0127] CPD repair in UV-irradiated HCTl 16 cells occurred earlier and was more complete in cells expressing a DN-CUL4 as compared to control cells (FIG. 11).</p>[0128] The results of this example confirmed that a dominant negative (DN) CUL4 enhances NER in vitro. \n\n EXAMPLE 6</p>[0129] This prophetic example describes a high-throughput screening (HTS) assay for identifying a substance that modulates (e.g., inhibits) CUL4A binding to DDBl. [0130] X-ray crystallographic studies have revealed the molecular details of the DDBl- CUL4A association (Angers et al, Nature, 443: 590-593 (2006); Li et al, Cell, 124: 105- 117 (2006)). Eight residues within the DDBl-BPB \u03b2-propeller region (A400, 1402, L404, V443, E537, W561, 1587, and R589) were identified to form direct contacts with CUL4A (FIG. 12). Both DDBl and CUL4A contain multiple modular domains for protein-protein interactions that mediate assembly of other E3 components and additional regulators. To direct the selection of inhibitors at the CUL4A-DDB1 binding interface, a binding assay will be established with the minimum domains of each binding partner. Moreover, to enhance hit selection and optimize assay parameters, the initial screen will focus on the binding site between the top surface of DDBl BPB (hereinafter, \"DDBl(BPB)\") (SEQ ID NO: 8) and the N-terminal \u03b1-helical region excluding the extreme N-terminal region of CUL4A ( hereinafter, \"CUL4A(NTD-N)\") (SEQ ID NO: 7). It should be noted that the cullin machinery assembles E3 complex components in a highly precise and orderly manner such that the substrate will be oriented directly toward the E2 conjugating enzyme to accept ubiquitin. Although the extreme N-terminus of CUL4A forms a second binding site for DDBl(BPB), it is expected that disruption of binding between the top surface of DDBl(BPB) and the \u03b1-helical domain of CUL4A likely will misorient the recruited substrate, as evidenced by the W561A mutation of DDBl(BPB) which abrogates binding and effectively abolishes E3 activity despite the intact second binding site. [0131] The design of a bead-based non-radioactive Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay is shown in FIG. 13, which can be adapted to provide a readout for the CUL4A(NTD-N)-DDB1 (BPB) interaction. This assay typically involves donor and acceptor beads designed to associate with respective binding partners. Upon laser excitation, a photosensitizer in the \"donor\" bead converts ambient oxygen to a more excited singlet state. The singlet state oxygen molecules diffuse across to react with a thioxene derivative in the \"acceptor\" bead generating chemiluminescence at 370 nm. Because the light emitted is actually higher energy (lower wavelength), it further activities fluorophores contained in the same bead. The fluorophores subsequently emit light at 520-620 nm. This cascade of chemical reactions only occurs when donor and acceptor beads are brought in close proximity (-200 nm) initiated by the interaction between the binding partners. If the interaction between the two partners is weak or disrupted by inhibitors, singlet oxygen generated by a donor bead decays rapidly to the ground state because they are less likely to encounter an acceptor beads. \n\n [0132] To apply the ALPHASCREEN\u2122 system (PerkinElmer), donor beads coupled with anti-GST antibody are used to capture GST-CUL4A(NTD-N), and acceptor beads that bind the FLAG tag are used to immobilize FLAG-DDBl (BPB). The proximity of donor to acceptor beads will be induced upon binding of CUL4A(NTD-N) to DDBl(BPB), resulting in the generation of luminescent signal at 520 nm upon excitation at 680 nm, as recorded by an ENVISION\u2122 Multilabel Plate Reader (PerkinElmer). The ALPHASCREEN\u2122 binding assay between GST-CUL4 A(NTD-N) and FLAG-DDBl (BPB) is performed in 384-well microplates in triplicate, and compounds eliciting greater than 50% inhibition in signal strength are defined as \"hits.\"</p>[0133] The parameters measured in the CUL4 A(NTD -N)-DDB 1 (BPB) binding assay include binding affinity, binding specificity, and vehicle (i.e., DMSO) sensitivity. [0134] The binding affinity between CUL4A(NTD-N) and DDB 1 (BPB) will be determined by mixing a constant amount of GST-CUL4 A(NTD-N) (50 nM as a starting point) with increasing concentrations of FLAG-DDBl (BPB) complex (2-200 nM) and incubating at room temperature for 2 hours. The final reaction volume will be 25 \u03bcL, containing 5 \u03bcL of each protein and 5 \u03bcL ALPHASCREEN\u2122 buffer. After mixing, the plate will be incubated at room temperature, shaking for 1 hour followed by addition of 5 \u03bcL each of ALPHASCREEN\u2122 GST-binding donor and FLAG-binding acceptor beads (20 ng/mL). The mixture will equilibrated at room temperature for 1 hour prior to reading. Each data point will be performed in triplicate. The binding data will be analyzed by GraphPad Prism software, and an apparent IQ will be determined. [0135] To demonstrate the specificity of CUL4 A(NTD -N)-DDB 1 (BPB) binding, competition assays will be performed with untagged CUL4A(NTD-N) and DDBl(BPB). When increasing concentrations of untagged CUL4 A(NTD-N) or DDBl(BPB) suppress binding between GST-CUL4A(NTD-N) and FLAG-DDBl (BPB), the IC<sub>50</sub> can be determined. The negative control is the FLAG-DDB 1 (BPB- W56 IA) mutant, which is incapable of binding CUL4A (Li et al, Cell, 124: 105-17 (2006)).</p>[0136] An effective HTS assay requires that protein targets retain full biological activity in significant concentrations of DMSO, the solvent used to dissolve small molecule libraries. To test the DMSO sensitivity of GST-CUL4A(NTD-N) and FLAG-DDBl (BPB) in the ALPHASCREEN\u2122 format, increasing concentrations (0-20%) of DMSO will be added to the binding mixture to determine the highest concentration that still retains efficient interaction.</p>[0137] This binding assay between affinity-purified recombinant CUL4A(NTD-N) and DDBl(BPB) for the ALPHASCREEN\u2122 format emphasizes the major protein-protein interface for interrogation. This approach may reduce the possibility of finding compounds that affect allosteric binding sites elsewhere on full-length CUL4A or DDBl that may alter \n\n the tertiary structure, resulting in effective disengagement of DDB1-CUL4A association. Therefore, an alternative approach employs full-length CUL4A (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 1) and DDBl (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 3) as binding partners in the ALPHASCREEN\u2122 assay format using full-length DDBl with an N-terminal FLAG-tag and full-length CUL4A (made by co- expressing CUL4A with Rbxl using a bicistronic pCool vector derived from pGEX-4T-l to improve the expression and folding/solubility of CUL4A (Li et al., Cell, 124: 105-17 (2006)). In yet another approach, a fragment of CUL4A (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 5 or SEQ ID NO: 6) and DDBl or DDBl(BPB) are used as binding partners in the ALPHASCREEN\u2122 assay. This assay can identify additional hits that alter the precise assembly of DDBl- CUL4A required for E3 ligase activity.</p>EXAMPLE 7</p>[0138] This prophetic example describes quantitative HTS assays to identify small molecules that disrupt DDB1-CUL4A interaction and ubiquitin ligase activity. [0139] Because a single point mutation in DDB1(BPB-W561A) is sufficient to disrupt DDB1-CUL4A binding (Li et al., Cell, 124: 105-17 (2006)), it is possible that small molecules targeting the key po",
    "ces allosteric changes in conformation can effectively collapse the DDB1-CUL4A interaction module and abrogate ubiquitin ligase function.</p>[0140] A large-scale high-throughput screen of library compounds will be performed to identify compounds that disrupt the DDB1(BPB)-CUL4A(NTD-N) interaction using the assay described in Example 6. Each component of the binding reaction is titrated such that the final concentration of each is near the top of the linear response range. The optimal order of addition of binding partners can be determined as follows. First, GST- CUL4A(NTD-N) is incubated with the compounds, and FLAG-DDBl (BPB) is subsequently added prior to recording the result. The screen is performed on a Biomek FX liquid handling workstation equipped with quadrant pipetting and plate stacker units (Beckman). The DDB1(BPB)-CUL4A(NTD-N) ALPHASCREEN\u2122 assay is performed in a 384-well microplate format with 352 unique compounds in each plate. Column 1 and column 24 contain positive (GST-CUL4A(NTD-N) and FLAG-DDBl(BPB)) and negative (GST-CUL4A(NTD-N) and FLAG-DDB 1(BPB-W56 IA)) controls. The compounds are diluted in the optimal DMSO concentration determined as described in Example 6 above to maximize the signal, and dispensed into the plate wells in 1 \u03bcL aliquots. This gives a final compound concentration of 10 mM in the 10 \u03bcL binding reaction, which is added at the same time as the GST-CUL4A(NTD-N) and FLAG-DDBl (BPB) at the optimal concentration and order-of-addition for this binding assay. Donor and acceptor beads are added and incubated for 1 hour, and the ALPHASCREEN\u2122 signal is read on an ENVISION\u2122 multiplate reader (PerkinElmer). Each plate must have a Z' score of 0.5 or \n\n greater with both positive and negative control wells (Zhang et al., J. Biomol. Screen, 4: 67- 73 (1999)). The Z'-factor (for assay quality) is be calculated automatically during data analysis using the ActivityBase software package (IDBS software, Emeryville, CA) for each plate. Compounds causing a 50% reduction in luminescent signal in two independent trials are classified as hits and subject to subsequent validation in secondary screens. [0141] Multiple secondary screens and specificity assays to eliminate false positives and nonspecific inhibitors will be performed. Compounds determined to be \"non-specific\" as documented by the Sloan Kettering HTS core database that were previously shown to hit multiple targets in multiple assays are eliminated. Measuring IC50 of the hits using a series of 2-fold compound dilutions in HTS format with the hit compounds enables pursuit of only those compounds that exhibit dose-dependent inhibition. Hits are organized into groups of structurally related compounds to identify common scaffolds and to examine the structure- activity relationship (SAR) of these hits and \"non-hits\" (i.e., no inhibition) with related structures from the chemical library database. The SAR analysis serves as a filter for hit confirmation, and defines the core structural features of these inhibitors. The reversibility of inhibition is determined by dialysis of the mixture of the protein complex with the test compound. This removes the inhibitor and restores the signal to control levels if inhibition is reversible. The authenticity of inhibition of the hit compounds is further tested by a conventional DDBl in vitro ubiquitination assay. Additionally, pull-down assays in the presence and absence of the hit compounds will be performed as an independent assay to verify perturbation of the DDB 1(BPB)-CUL4 A(NTD-N) interaction. The hit compound(s) fulfilling all the criteria laid out will be further pursued. Any compounds that irreversibly inhibit DDB1(BPB)-CUL4A(NTD-N) association, that are specific can be pursued further, since the two longest used antibacterial and anti-cancer drugs are in this class (penicillin and 5-FU).</p>[0142] Compounds from the secondary screen with potent IC50 values will be chosen to test whether they perturb DDB1-CUL4A ubiquitin ligase activity and NER activities in vivo. Prior to testing in vivo activities of hit compounds, cell permeability of candidates will be determined using parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA), which uses a lipid- filled membrane to determine the passive, transcellular permeability properties of potential drug compounds (Kansy et al., J. Med. Chem., 41: 1007-10 (1998)). The PAMPA assay (Millipore) is relatively simple, inexpensive, and straightforward, yet produces comparable results to traditional cell-based assays like those using Caco-2 cells (Kansy et al., J. Med. Chem., 41: 1007-10 (1998)). Compounds with good cell permeability will be subsequently tested in cell lines. Potent leads that display poor membrane permeability can be modified to be more lipophilic to improve membrane permeability, while taking care to avoid compromising solubility. \n\n [0143] The primary CuU A<sup>m</sup> and DDBl<sup>fl/fl</sup> MEF cells (Cang et al, Cell, 127: 929-40 (2006)) and human HCTl 16 colon cancer cells are established model cell lines to test the effects of inhibitors on DDB2 degradation and to measure the effects on NER activity. Cells will be treated with test compounds or vehicle for 4 hours, and then harvested and lysed for immunob lotting using antibodies against DDB2, DDBl, CUL4A, and \u03b2-actin (control). Compounds that selectively cause an increase in DDB2 expression are further eval"
