When increasing concentrations of untagged CUL4 A(NTD-N) or DDBl(BPB) suppress binding between GST-CUL4A(NTD-N) and FLAG-DDBl (BPB), the IC<sub>50</sub> can be determined. \n\n\nNo other sentences met the criteria as they either lacked a specific molecule name, bioactivity metric, numeric value, or unit."}
