    "in CDR3, light chain CDR1, light chain CDR2 and light chain CDR3 comprising amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NOS: 1, 4, 6, 2, 5 and 7, respectively, is collectively referred to herein as \"101\". An anti-CNTN4 antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof comprising a heavy chain variable region and a light chain variable region comprising amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NOS: 36 and 37, respectively, is collectively referred to herein as \"A101\". In certain embodiments, \"A101\" refers to an antigen-binding fragment, particularly a scFv, and an antibody prepared using the same may be referred to as A101-IgG antibody.</p>The anti-CNTN4 antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the present invention may specifically bind to CNTN4 protein, preferably human or mouse CNTN4 protein.</p>As used herein, the terms \"bind specifically to\" or \"specific for\" refer to a measurable and reproducible interaction, such as binding, between a target and an antibody that is determinative for the presence of the target in the presence of a heterogeneous population of molecules, including biological molecules. For example, an antibody that specifically binds to a particular target (e.g., an epitope) means an antibody that binds to that target with greater affinity, greater avidity, more readily, and/or with a longer duration than that antibody binds to other targets.</p>The term \"specifically binds to a CNTN4 protein\" as used herein may mean an antibody that binds to CNTN4 protein with an equilibrium dissociation constant (K <sub>D</sub> ) of 5\u042510 <sup>-8</sup> M or less, preferably 1\u042510 <sup>-8</sup> M or less, more preferably 5\u042510 <sup>-9</sup> M or less. Accordingly, the anti-CNTN4 antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the present invention may bind to CNTN4 protein, such as human CNTN4 protein, with an equilibrium dissociation constant (K <sub>D</sub> ) of 5\u042510 <sup>-8</sup> M or less, preferably, with a K <sub>D</sub> of 1\u042510 <sup>-8</sup> M or less, more preferably, 5\u042510 <sup>-9</sup> M or less.</p>The term \"K <sub>D</sub> \" as used herein refers to the association equilibrium dissociation constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction, and is calculated by the formula K <sub>D</sub> = Kd / Ka, where Ka is the association rate constant and Kd is the dissociation rate constant, wherein the constant K <sub>D</sub> has units of M. The K <sub>D</sub> value for an antibody can be measured using methods well-established in the art. A preferred method for measuring the K <sub>D</sub> value of an antibody is surface plasmon resonance (SPR), preferably using a biosensor system such as the Biacore\u00ae system, or bio-layer interferometry (BLI), such as the Octet\u00ae system. In one specific example, the K <sub>D</sub> mentioned herein may be a value obtained via SPR. </p>In one embodiment, the anti-CNTN4 antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the invention is monospecific and binds specifically to a single epitope, i.e., CNTN4 protein.</p>In another embodiment, the anti-CNTN4 antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the invention is a multispecific, e.g., bispecific or trispecific, antibody molecule. A multispecific antibody molecule comprises multiple variable regions, each of which has binding specificity for a different epitope. In one embodiment, the first variable region of the bispecific antibody molecule has a first binding specificity for a first epitope, e.g., a CNTN4 protein, and the second variable region has a second binding specificity for a second epitope, e.g., a target protein other than a CNTN4 protein.</p>In one specific embodiment, the bispecific antibody molecule can bind to an immune checkpoint protein. An immune checkpoint protein refers to both a protein involved in a pathway that suppresse",
