    "g, among other poly ADP-ribosylations in DNA repair, and NAD is also involved in sirtuin It is essential for the deacetylase activity of Sirtuin [Reference: Garten, A. et al Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism, 20, 130-138, 2008].</p><p id=\"p03\" num=\"3\">Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NamPT) is an enzyme that catalyzes the phosphoribosylation of nicotinamide and is the rate-limiting enzyme in one of the two pathways that restore NAD.</p><p id=\"p04\" num=\"4\">There is increasing evidence that NamPT inhibitors have efficacy as anticancer agents. Cancer cells have higher basal turnover of NAD and also require higher energy compared to normal cells. Additionally, increased NamPT expression is associated with colorectal cancer [Van Beijnum, J.R. et al Int. J. Cancer 101, 118-127, 2002], and there is also a report that NamPT is involved in blood vessel formation [Reference: Kim, S.R. et al. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 357, 150-156, 2007]. Small molecule inhibitors of NamPT cause depletion of intracellular NAD+ levels and ultimately induce tumor cell death [Hansen, CM et al. Anticancer Res. 20, 42111-4220, 2000], as well as shown to inhibit tumor growth in xenograft models [Olese, U.H. et al. Mol Cancer Ther. 9, 1609-1617, 2010].</p><p id=\"p05\" num=\"5\">NamPT inhibitors also have potential as therapeutic agents in inflammatory and metabolic disorders. Galli, M. et al Cancer Res. 70, 8-11, 2010]. For example, NamPT is a predominant enzyme in T and B lymphocytes. Selective inhibition of NamPT can suppress the development of autoimmune diseases by reducing NAD+ in lymphocytes, but this is not the case for cell types with other NAD+ synthesis pathways. A small molecule NamPT inhibitor (FK866) has been shown to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of activated T cells and was effective in an animal model of arthritis (collagen-induced arthritis) [Busso, N. et al. Plos One 3, e2267, 2008]. NamPT activity increases NF-\u03bb transcriptional activity and causes MMP-2 and MMP-9 activation in human vascular endothelial cells, suggesting a role for NamPT inhibitors in the prevention of inflammation-mediated complications of obesity and type 2 diabetes. [Reference: Adya, R. et. Al. Diabetes Care, 31, 758-760, 2008].</p><p id=\"p06\" num=\"6\">One of the above NamPT inhibitors, (E)-N-[4-(1-benzoylpiperidin-4-yl)butyl]-3-(pyridin-3-yl)-acrylamide (also APO866, FK866, WK175 or (known as WK22.175, hereinafter referred to as 'FK866' [international non-trade name]) is also known in particular as an anti-cancer agent. FK866 can be used in the treatment of diseases associated with deregulated apoptosis, such as cancer. In the prior art, FK866 has been demonstrated to interfere with nicotinamide adenyl dinucleotide (also known as NAD and referred to below) biosynthesis and induce apoptotic cell death without any DNA damaging effects.</p><p id=\"p07\" num=\"7\">Additionally, FK866 induces apoptosis in HepG2 cells without conferring a major effect on cellular energy metab",

In this experiment, Abcam's NAMPT colorimetric assay kit (ab221819) was used, and Graph prism software was used to calculate IC50. To synthesize nicotinamide into nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), nicotinamide was added with PRPP, ATP, NMNAT1, NAMPT recombinant proteins, and the compounds of the above examples at various concentrations (from 100 \u03bcM to half-log Stepwise dilution) was added and reacted at room temperature for 1 hour with a total of 60 \u03bcl of reaction solution. WST-1 formazan converted by NAD produced by adding WST-1 was measured.
