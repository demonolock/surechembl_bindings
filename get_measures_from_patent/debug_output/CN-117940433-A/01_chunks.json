    "y the method of Mobility SHIFT ASSAY. In the experiment, the test compounds were tested for inhibition of MK2 activity at an initial concentration of 10000nM, 3-fold dilution, 10 total concentrations, and a multiplex assay. Compound PF-3644022 was used as a standard control.</p>1-Fold kinase buffer (50mM HEPES,pH 7.5,0.0015%Brij-35) and stop solution (100mM HEPES,pH 7.5,0.015%Brij-35,0.2%Coating Reagent#3,50mM EDTA) were prepared. Adding a proper amount of kinase into a 1-time kinase buffer solution to prepare a 2.5-time enzyme solution; compound dilutions were prepared at 5-fold compound concentrations (1-fold kinase buffer, 10% dmso), starting stock 50 \u03bcm, 1:5; appropriate amounts of FAM-labeled polypeptide (P11) and ATP were added to 1-fold kinase buffer to prepare a 2.5-fold substrate solution. Adding 5 mu l of 5-fold compound diluent and 10 mu l of 2.5-fold enzyme solution into a reaction well of a 384-well reaction plate, uniformly mixing, and incubating for 10 minutes at room temperature; then 10. Mu.l of 2.5-fold substrate solution was added to 384-well plates and centrifuged at 1000rpm for 1 minute; the reaction plate was incubated at 28\u2103for 60 min; adding 25 \u03bcl of stop solution into 384-well reaction plate to stop reaction, and centrifuging at 1000rpm for 1 min; finally, the conversion data is read at Caliper EZ Reader II.</p>IC <sub>50</sub> values for the compounds were fit using XLFIT excel add-in version 5.4.0.8.</p>Fitting formula:</p>Y\uff1dBottom+(Top-Bottom)/(1+(IC50/X)^HillSlope)</p> Wherein Y is a conversion signal value, X is the concentration of a tested compound, top is the highest position of a dose-response curve, bottom is the base line position of the dose-response curve, and HillSlope is a slope coefficient. </p>The MK2 kinase biochemical inhibitory activity of the compounds of the present disclosure was determined by the above assay and the IC <sub>50</sub> values measured are shown in Table 1.</p>TABLE 1</p>Numbering deviceMK2IC <sub>50</sub>(nM) Numbering deviceMK2IC <sub>50</sub>(nM) Compound A316 <sup>a</sup>Compound 1909Compound 298Compound 3210Compound 4182Compound 5232Compound 6267Compound 780Compound 882.6Compound 981Compound 10140.8Compound 1154.5Compound 124.3Compound 13347.1Compound 145.2Compound 15767Compound 1662Compound 17363Compound 1834Compound 19191Compound 2033Compound 2197Compound 21-1112Compound 21-294Compound 22143Compound 23232Compound 2474Compound 25&gt;1000Compound 2644Compound 272.8Compound 28270Compound 291.4Compound 30666Compound 31360Compound 32462Compound 33&gt;1000Compound 34&gt;1000Compound 35500Compound 36115Compound 3725Compound 384.1Compound 396.2Compound 4023Compound 416.8Compound 42107Compound 43162Compound 44105Compound 45529Compound 46&gt;1000Compound 4775Compound 4842Compound 49825Compound 50196Compound 51422</p>Compound 52115Compound 53252Compound 5423Compound 55702Compound 56147Compound 57280Compound 58279Compound 5997Compound 60580Compound 61950Compound 62347Compound 6322Compound 6"
