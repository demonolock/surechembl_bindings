    "\n\n In one highly preferred embodiment, the invention includes a method of inhibiting proliferation of a mammalian immunodeficiency virus comprising the step of contacting mammalian cells that are infected with a mammalian immunodeficiency virus with a composition comprising an MDC-IV antagonist compound or TARC-IV antagonist compound, in an amount effective to inhibit proliferation of said virus in said cells. The family of mammalian immunodeficiency viruses is intended to include human immunodeficiency viruses, such as strains of HTV-1 and HIV-2, and analogous viruses known to infect other mammalian species, including but not limited to simian and feline immunodeficiency viruses. The method can be performed in vitro (e.g., in cell culture), but preferably is performed in vivo by administering the antagonist to an infected subject, e.g., anHIV-infected human subject. (In yet another embodiment, the method is performed prophylacticly on a subject at risk of developing an HTV infection, e.g., due to the subject's likelihood of exposure to contaminated blood samples, contaminated needles, or intimate exposure to an HTV-infected person.)</p>The term \"MDC-IV antagonist compound\" refers to compounds that antagonize the apparent Immunodeficiency Virus-proliferative effects of MDC in infected cells. Thus, the term \"MDC-IV antagonist compound\" is meant to include any compound that is capable of inhibiting proliferation of the immunodeficiency virus in a manner analogous to either the inhibition reported herein for MDC neutralizing antibodies or the inhibition reported herein for certain MDC analogs (e.g., analogs having amino terminal additions or truncations). For example, anti-MDC antibodies are highly preferred MDC-IV antagonist compounds. For treatment of humans infected with an HTV virus, humanized antibodies are highly preferred. Similarly, polypeptides that comprise an antigen-binding fragment of an anti-MDC antibody and that are capable of binding to MDC are preferred MDC-IV antagonist compounds.</p>As described elsewhere herein in greater detail, amino-terminal truncations of mature human MDC(l-69) possess antiproliferative activity against HIV-1. Thus, another set of preferred MDC-IV antagonist compounds are polypeptides whose amino acid sequence consists of a portion of the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2 sufficient to bind to the chemokine receptor CCR4, said portion having an amino-terminus between residues 3 and 12 of SEQ ID NO: 2 (i.e., analogs lacking at least three amino acids from the amino terminus of MDC(l-69). Amino terminal deletion analogs that have been further modified, e.g., by including \n\nan oligopeptide tag to facilitate purification, or by including an initiator methionine for bacterial expression, are also contemplated.</p>Amino-terminal additions to mature MDC also result in analogs possessing antiproliferative activity against HIV-1. Thus, another set of preferred MDC-IV antagonist compounds are polypeptides that comprise a mature MDC sequence (e.g., amino acids 1-69 of SEQ ",
    "ein in prokaryotic cells, as well as the cleavage of the fusion protein and purification of the recombinant MDC. Example 7 describes alternative DNA constructs useful for expression of recombinant MDC protein, and describes the production of MDC by a bacterial host transformed with such a construct. Example 8 provides experimental protocols for purification of recombinant MDC produced, e.g., as described in Example 7. Examples 9 and 10 provide protocols for the recombinant production of MDC in yeast and mammalian cells, respectively. In addition, Example 10 provides additional protocols for purification of recombinant MDC, and describes the determination of the amino terminus of MDC recombinantly produced in mammalian cells. Example 11 describes production of MDC and MDC polypeptide analogs by peptide synthesis. Certain preferred analogs are specifically described in Example 11.</p>Examples 12-17 provide protocols for the determination of MDC biological activities. For instance, Example 12 provides an assay of MDC effects upon basophils, mast cells, and eosinophils. MDC-induced chemotaxis of eosinophils is specifically demonstrated. Example 13 describes assays of chemoattractant and cell-activation properties of MDC on monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, and granulocytes. MDC induced macrophage chemotaxis, but inhibited monocyte chemotaxis.</p>Examples 14-17 provide protocols for the determination of MDC biological activities in vivo. Example 14 provides an MDC tumor growth- inhibition assay. Examples 15 and 16 provide protocols for assaying MDC activity via intraperitoneal and subcutaneous \n\ninjection, respectively. Example 17 provides protocols for determining the myelosuppressive activity of MDC.</p>Example 18 provides protocols for generating antibodies that are specifically immunoreactive with MDC, including polyclonal, monoclonal, and humanized antibodies. Uses ofthe antibodies also are described.</p>Example 19 provides a calcium flux assay for determining the ability of MDC to induce cellular activation.</p>Example 20 provides assays and experimental results relating to the HIV proliferative and anti-proliferative effects of human mature MDC and MDC antagonists. Example 21 demonstrates the anti-proliferative effects of MDC on fibroblasts.</p>Example 22 provides in vitro assays for the effects of MDC upon the proliferation of additional cell types. Example 23 provides an in vivo assay for determining the anti-proliferative effects of MDC on fibroblasts.</p>Example 24 describes the chromosomal localization ofthe human MDC gene. Example 25 describes procedures which identified the CC chemokine receptor</p>\"CCR4\" as a high affinity binding partner of MDC. Examples 26 and 27 provide assays for identifying MDC modulators.</p>Example 28 describes the isolation of cDNAs encoding rat, mouse, and macaque MDC, and characterizes the MDC proteins encoded thereby. Example 29 further characterizes selected MDC analogs.</p>Example 30 describes experiments",
    "purified and partially sequenced using an automated sequencer and primer GEX5 (SEQ ID NO: 12), which hybridizes to the pGEX-3X vector near the BamHI cloning site. The sequence obtained with this primer confirmed the presence ofthe desired MDC insert in the proper orientation.</p>Induction of the GST-MDC fusion protein was achieved by growing the transformed XL-1 Blue culture at 37<sup>C</sup>C in LB medium (supplemented with carbenicillin) to an optical density at wavelength 600 nm of 0.4, followed by further incubation for 4 hours in the presence of 0.25 to 1.0 mM Isopropyl \u03b2-D-Thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis MO).</p>The fusion protein, produced as an insoluble inclusion body in the bacteria, was purified as follows. Cells were harvested by centrifugation; washed in 0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 8, 1 mMEDTA; and treated with 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma Chemical Co.) for 15 minutes at room temperature. The lysate was cleared by sonication, and cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 12,000 X g. The fusion protein-containing pellet was resuspended in 50 mM Tris, pH 8, and 10 mM EDTA, layered over 50% glycerol, and centrifuged for 30 min. at 6000 X g. The pellet was resuspended in standard phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS) free of Mg<sup>\"</sup>\" and CaA The fusion protein, which remained insoluble, was \n\napproximately 80-90% ofthe protein mass and migrated in denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gels with a relative molecular weight of 33 kD. The protein yield, as judged by Coomassie staining, was approximately 100 mg/1 of E. coli culture.</p>The fusion protein was subjected to thrombin digestion to cleave the GST from the mature MDC protein. The digestion eaction (20-40 ug fusion protein, 20-30 units human thrombin (4000 U/ mg (Sigma) in 0.5 ml PBS) was incubated 16-48 hrs. at room temperature and loaded on a denaturing SDS-PAG\u0395 gel to fractionate the reaction products. The gel was soaked in 0.4 M KC1 to visualize the GST and MDC protein bands, which migrated as fragments of approximately 26 kD and 7 kD, respectively. The identity ofthe 7 kD SDS-PAG\u0395 fragment was confirmed by partial amino acid sequence analysis. First, the protein was excised from the gel, electroeluted in 25 mM Tris base and 20 mM glycine, and collected onto a PVDF membrane in a Pro Spin column (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Subjecting the sample to automated sequencing (Applied Biosystems Model 473 A, Foster City, CA) yielded 15 residues of sequence information, which corresponded exactly to the expected N-terminus ofthe predicted mature form of MDC (S\u0395Q ID NO: 2, amino acid residues 1 to 15).</p>Example 7</p>Production of Recombinant MDC in Bacteria MDC peptides and analogs can be expressed using a variety of bacterial expression systems including E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, streptomyces lividans, and many others. [For a general review see \"Gene Expression Technology\" in Methods in Enzymology. Vol. 185: pp. 1- 283, Ed. D.V. Goeddel, Academic Press, San Diego, CA (1990).] In general, an expression cassette comprised of a transcription element (a promoter), a translation element, a coding region to be expressed (for example MDC), and a transcription termination element is developed and optimized to effect significant gene expression. This cassette is incorporated into either episomal plasmids, which confer stable propagation, or into integration vectors to mediate the insertion or creation (via homologous recombination) of an expression cassette within the host genome.

The precipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation, fractionated on an</p>18% Tris Glycine gel (NO VEX), and blotted to a PVDF membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). \n\n MDC bound to the membrane was detected by a crude preparation of monoclonal antibody to MDC (prepared as described in Example 18). Cells from the clone secreting the highest level of MDC protein (approx. 1 \u03bcg/ml) were removed from the plate by treatment with a solution of 0.5% trypsin and 5.3 mM EDTA (GIBCO) and used to start a suspension culture in \u03b1<sup>\"</sup> medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Over the course of 8 days, 5 volumes of P5 medium were added to the culture. Proteins were precipitated from the culture supematant by addition of polyethylene glycol (MW 8000, Union Carbide, Danbury, CT) to 20 % (weight/volume), fractionated on an 18% Tris glycine gel, and electroblotted to a PVDF membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) in CAPS buffer (3-[Cyclohexylamino]-l-propanesulfonic acid, pH 10.4) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). A strip ofthe filter was removed for detection of MDC by western blotting with the supematant from a hybridoma cell line producing anti-MDC monoclonal antibodies (See Example 18). The reactive band, which migrated with an apparent molecular weight of 6.4 kD, was excised from the remaining portion ofthe filter.</p>Using an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Model 473 A, Foster City, CA), the sequence ofthe N-terminus ofthe protein was determined to be: GPYGANMEDS. This sequence is identical to that of residues 1 to 10 of SEQ ID NO. 2, corresponding to the N- terminus ofthe predicted mature form of MDC.</p>F. Purification of MDC for biological assays For growth of larger cultures, MDC-expressing CHO cells were grown to 80% confluence on tissue culture plates in \u03b1<sup>'</sup> medium. The cells were removed from the plates by treatment with trypsin and EDTA and resuspended at a density of 3 x 10<sup>s</sup> cells/ml in P5 medium plus 1% FBS in a spinner flask at 37 \u00b0C. Additional P5/l% FBS medium was added as needed to keep the cell density in the range of 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> to 3 x 10<sup>6</sup>. After 11 days in culture, the cells were removed from the medium by filtration.</p>The pH ofthe culture medium was adjusted to 6.8, and it was passed over a heparin-Sepaharose CL-6B column (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ). After washing with 0.2 M NaCl in potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, the column was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.2 to 0.7 M NaCl. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie stained to determine which of them contained MDC. MDC eluted from the column at approximately 0.6 M NaCl. \n\n The fractions containing MDC were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration in stirred-cell chamber (Amicon, Beverly, MA) using a filter with a MW cutoff of 3 kD. Octylglucoside (10 mM final concentration, Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals) was added to the concentrated MDC, which subsequently was passed through a Sephacryl HR100 column (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ). Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE for the presence of MDC. The final yield of MDC protein was approximately 0.1 mg/liter of culture supematant, and the purity was estimated to be greater than 95%, as judged by Coomassie staining.</p>Example 11 Production of MDC and MDC Analogs by Peptide Synthesis</p>MDC and MDC polypeptide analogs are prepared by chemical peptide synthesis using techniques that have been used successfully for the production of other chemokines such as IL-8 [Clark-Lewis et al, J. Biol Chem., 266:23128-34 (1991)] and MCP-1. Such methods are advantageous because they are rapid, reliable for short sequences such as chemokines, and enable the selective introduction of novel, unnatural amino acids and other chemical modifications.</p>For example, MDC and MDC analogs were chemically synthesized using optimized stepwise solid-phase methods [Schnolzer et al, Int. J. Pept Protein Res., 40:180</p>(1992)] based on t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) chemistries of Merrifield [J. Am. Chem. Soc,</p>55:2149-2154 (1963)] on an Applied Biosystems 430A Peptide Synthesizer (Foster City, CA). The proteins were purified by reverse-phase HPLC and characterized by standard methods, including electrospray mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance.</p>The chemically synthesized MD",
    "Example 18. The chemically synthesized MDC also appeared to behave in the same manner as the recombinant MDC in immunoprecipitation assays with the anti-MDC monoclonal antibodies. These studies indicate \n\nthat the denatured and the non-denatured structures of chemically synthesized MDC are similar to those of recombinant MDC.</p>The following MDC analogs also have been chemically synthesized:</p>1. \"MDC (n+1)\" (SEQ ID NO: 30) consists of Leucine followed by residues 1 to 69 of SEQ ID NO. 2. This analog has alternatively been referred to herein as \"MDC(0-69).\"</p>2. \"MDC (9-69)\" consists of residues 9 to 69 of SEQ ID NO. 2.</p>3. \"MDC-yl\" (SEQ ID NO: 31) consists of residues 1 to 69 of SEQ ID NO. 2, with the following substitution: Residues 59-60 (Trp- Val) were replaced with the sequence Tyr- Leu. A related analog \"MDC-wvas\" consists of residues 1 to 69 of SEQ ID NO. 2, with the following substitution: Residues 59-60 (Trp- Val) were replaced with the sequence</p>Ala-Ser.</p>4. \"MDC-eyfy\" (SEQ ID NO: 32) consists of residues 1 to 69 of SEQ ID NO. 2, with the following substitution: Residues 28-31 (His-Phe-Tyr-Trp) were replaced with the sequence Glu-Tyr-Phe-Tyr, derived from the amino acid sequence of the chemokine RANTES (residues 26-29 of SEQ ID NO: 21).</p>The analogs \"MDC (n+1)\", \"MDC (9-69)\", and \"MDC-yl\" are expected to be antagonists of MDC activity, inhibiting MDC activity by competitively binding to the same receptor that recognizes MDC. Altematively, they may effect inhibition by forming inactive heterodimers with the native MDC. Possible activities of the analog \"MDC-eyfy\" include inhibition of MDC as described for the previous analogs. Altematively, \"MDC-eyfy\" may confer some ofthe activities typical of the chemokine RANTES, such as chemotaxis of T lymphocytes, monocytes, or eosinophils.</p>Additionally, the following single-amino acid alterations (alone or in combination) are specifically contemplated: (1) substitution of a non-basic amino acid for the basic arginine and/or lysine amino acids at positions 24 and 27, respectively, of SEQ ID NO: 2; (2) substitution of a charged or polar amino acid (e.g., serine, lysine, arginine, histidine, aspartate, glutamate, asparagine, glutamine or cysteine) for the tyrosine amino acid at position 30 of SEQ ID NO: 2, the tryptophan amino acid at position 59 of SEQ ID NO: 2, and/or the valine amino acid at position 60 of SEQ ID NO: 2; and (3) substitution of a basic or small, non-charged amino acid (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine, glycine, alanine) for the glutamic acid amino acid at position 50 \n\nof SEQ ID NO: 2. Specific analogs having these amino acid alterations are encompassed by the following formula (SEQ ID NO: 25):</p>Met Ala Arg Leu Gin Thr Ala Leu Leu Val Val Leu Val Leu Leu Ala</p>-24 -20 -15 -10</p>Val Ala Leu Gin Ala Thr Glu Ala Gly Pro Tyr Gly Ala Asn Met Glu -5 1 5</p>Asp Ser Val Cys Cys Arg Asp Tyr Val Arg Tyr Arg Leu Pro Leu Xaa 10 15 20</p>Val Val Xaa His Phe Xaa Trp Thr Ser Asp Ser Cys Pro Arg Pro Gly 25 30 35 40</p>Val Val Leu Leu Thr Phe Arg Asp Lys Xaa lie Cys Ala Asp Pro Arg</p>45 50 55</p",
    "h the filter are quantitated by reading fluorescence per well in a fluorescent plate reader (Cytofluor, Millipore Inc., Boston, MA).</p>A series of experiments were performed using art-recognized procedures to determine the chemotactic properties of MDC. Initially, the response of human mononuclear cells to MDC was determined. The effect of MDC on the chemotactic response of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (granulocytes) also was examined.</p>It has been established that MCP-1, which is a C-C chemokine, causes both recruitment and activation of monocytes but appears to have limited ability to induce the \n\nmigration of macrophages. The failure of MCP-1 to attract macrophages appears to be correlated to the differentiation process: as monocytic cells differentiate, there is a progressive decrease in cell response to MCP-1 [Denholm and Stankus, Cytokine, 7: 436-440 (1995)]. The biological activities of MCP- 1 appear to correlate with the expression of this chemokine, with MCP-1 mRNA being found in monocytes but decreasing as these cells differentiate.</p>The pattern of expression of MDC appears to be the reverse of that described for MCP-1, with the amount of mRNA for MDC increasing as monocytes differentiate to macrophages. To determine whether this expression pattern correlates to the biological response to MDC, the effects of MDC on the migration of monocytes and macrophages were compared.</p>A number of different leukocyte cells types were analyzed in chemotaxis and chemotaxis inhibition assays. Human mononuclear and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were isolated from peripheral blood using methods known in the art [Denholm et al, Amer. J. Pathol, 735:571-580 (1989)]. Second, the human monocytic cell line, THP-1 (obtained from the ATCC, Rockville, MD, and maintained in culture in RPMI with 10% FBS and with pennicillin steptomycin) was employed. THP-1 cells can be cultured as monocytes or can be induced to differentiate to macrophages by treatment with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) [Denholm and Stankus, Cytokine, 7:436-440 (1995)]. In some experiments monocytic THP-1 cells were employed, and in others monocytic THP-1 cells were differentiated to macrophages by incubation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Third, guinea pig peritoneal macrophages were obtained essentially as described in Yoshimura, J. Immunol, 750:5025-5032 (1993). Briefly, animals were given an intraperitoneal injection of 3% sterile thioglycollate (DIFCO) two days prior to cell harvest. Macrophages were obtained from the peritoneal cavity by lavage with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 1 mM EDTA and 0.1% glucose. Cells were washed once by centrifugation and then utilized in chemotaxis assays as described below.</p>Assays of chemotactic activity were carried out, using the cell preparations described above, essentially as described by Denholm and Stankus, Cytometry, 79:366-369 (1995), using 96-well chambers (Neuroprobe Inc., Cabin John, MD) and cells labeled with the fluorescent dye, calcein (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Polycarbonate filters used in this assay were PVP-free (Neuroprobe Inc.); filter pore sizes used for different cell types were: 5 \u03bcm for \n\nmonocytes and THP-1 cells, 3 \u03bcm for polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and 8 \u03bcm for guinea pig macrophages.</p>Fifty thousand calcein labelled cells were resuspended in RPMI medium containing 2 mg/ml BSA and placed in the upper wells. MDC or other test substances were diluted in RPMI with BSA (e.g., final MDC concentrations of 25, 50, 100, 250 ng/ml) and placed in the lower wells. Following incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 2 hours, unmigrated cells remaining above the filter were removed by wiping; the filter was then air-dried. Controls in these assays were: RPMI with BSA as the negative control, and 50 ng/ml of MCP-1 and 1% zymosan activated serum (ZAS, prepared as described [Denholm and Lewis, Amer. J. Pathol, 726:464-474, (1987)]) were used as positive controls. Migration of cells was quantitated on a fluorescent plate reader (Cytofluor, Millipore Inc. Bedford, MA) and the number of cells migrated expressed as fluorescent units.</p>In assays of inhibitory activity, cells in the upper wells of the chambers were suspended in varying concentrations (0.005, 0.05, 0.5, 5.0, and 50 ng/ml) of MDC. The lower wells ofthe chamber were filled with either medium alone or the chemotactic factors, MCP-1 or zymosan activated serum (ZAS). Inhibition was assessed by comparing the number of cells that migrated to MCP-1 or ZAS, in the absence of MDC, to the number of cells that migrated with increasing concentrations of MDC. Preparation of cells and quantitation of assays was performed exactly as described above for the chemotaxis assays. The number of cells migrated was expressed as fluorescent units.</p>As indicated in Figure 2, MDC did not induce THP- 1 -derived mononuclear cell migration, but rather appeared to inhibit mononuclear cell migration, at concentrations between 10 and 100 ng/ml. Other C-C chemokines, such as MCP-1 and RANTES, typically induce maximal monocyte chemotaxis within this concentration range. As shown in Figure 3, MDC, at concentrations of .001 to 100 ng/ml had no net effect on granulocyte migration. In respect to this lack of effect on granulocyte chemotaxis, MDC is similar to other previously described C-C chemokines.</p>The response of both macrophage and monocyte THP-1 cells to MDC is shown in Figure 4. Macrophages (closed circles) migrated to MDC in a dose dependent manner, with optimal activity at 50 ng/ml. The decrease in macrophage chemotactic response to MDC at higher concentrations (100 ng/ml) reflects a desensitization of cells which is typical of most \n\nchemotactic factors at high concentrations [Falk and Leonard, Infect. Immunol, 32:464-468 (1981)]. Monocytic THP-1 cells (open circles) however, did not migrate to MDC.</p>The chemotactic activity of MDC for macrophages was fur",
    "uch as arthritis, the accumulation of macrophages is understood to be detrimental and destructive. The ability of MDC to promote macrophage chemotaxis indicates a therapeutic utility for MDC inhibitors ofthe invention, to prevent, reduce, or eliminate macrophage accumulation in tissues.</p>The results ofthe chemotaxis assays with human mononuclear cells, presented in Figure 2, suggested that MDC might inhibit cell migration. In the absence of MDC, monocytic THP-1 cells migrate to MCP-1, as shown in Figure 6 (MDC of 0 ng/ml). However, when cells are exposed to MDC, the chemotactic response to MCP-1 (closed circles) is decreased. MDC, at concentrations of 0.005-0.5 ng/ml, inhibited monocyte chemotactic response to MCP-1. Although MDC inhibited the chemotactic response of monocytes to MCP-1, there was no significant effect of MDC on chemokinesis, or random migration, as reflected by the numbers of cells migrating to medium alone (open circles, RPMI with BSA), either in the presence of absence of MDC. \n\n The inhibitory activity of MDC on monocyte chemotaxis indicates therapeutic utility for MDC in the treatment of several chronic inflammatory conditions (atherosclerosis, arthritis, pulmonary fibrosis) in which monocyte chemotaxis appears to play an important pathogenic role. Enhancing the activity of MDC in such diseases might result in the decreased migration of monocytes into tissues, thereby lessening the severity of disease symptoms.</p>Example 14</p>MDC In Vivo Tumor Growth Inhibition Assay Tumor growth-inhibition properties of MDC are assayed, e.g., by modifying the protocol described by Laning et al, J. Immunol, 753:4625-4635 (1994) for assaying the tumor growth-inhibitory properties of murine TCA3. An MDC-encoding cDNA is transfected by electroporation into the myeloma-derived cell line J558 (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD). Transfectants are screened for MDC production by standard techniques such as ELISA (enzyme-linked immunoadsorbant assay) using a monoclonal antibody generated against MDC as detailed in Example 18. A bolus of 10 million cells from an MDC-producing clone is injected subcutaneously into the lower right quadrant of BALB/c mice. For comparison, 10 million non-transfected cells are injected into control mice. The rate and frequency of tumor formation in the two groups is compared to determine efficacy of MDC in inhibiting tumor growth. The nature of the cellular infiltrate subsequently associated with the tumor cells is identified by histologic means. In addition, recombinant MDC (20 ng) is mixed with non- transfected J558 cells and injected (20 ng/day) into tumors derived from such cells, to assay the effect of MDC administered exogenously to tumor cells.</p>Example 15 Intraperitoneal Injection Assay</p>The cells which respond to MDC in vivo are determined through injection of 1- 1000 ng of purified MDC into the intraperitoneal cavity of mice or other mammals (e.g., rabbits or guinea pigs), as described by Luo et al, J. Immunol, 753:4616-",
    "gnized by monoclonals 252Y and 252Z.</p>E. Antibodies 252Y and 252Z are useful for immunoprecipitating MDC</p>The following experiments were conducted which demonstrate a utility for antibodies 252Y and 252Z for immuprecipitation of MDC. Antibodies 252Y, 252Z, and an irrelevant isotype-matched control were added separately at a concentration of 10 \u03bcg/ml to an extraction buffer (1% triton X-100, 10 mM Tris base, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mMNaCl, 30 mMNa pyrophospate, 50 mM NaP, 100 \u03bcM Na Orthovanadate, pH 7.6) containing 100 ng/ml MDC. These samples were incubated on ice for 1 hour. To precipitate the immune complexes, 15 \u03bcl of protein G sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech # 17-0618-01) were added to each sample and incubated on a rotation apparatus at 4\u00b0C for 30 minutes. The samples were then centrifuged to collect the protein G sepharose/immune complexes, washed three times (1 ml each) in extraction buffer, boiled/solubilized in 2X SDS-PAGE buffer, electrophoresed on an 18% SDS-PAGE gel, and western blotted to PVDF membrane (Novex # LC2002). Nonspecific binding sites on the PVDF membrane were blocked with TBS Tw20/1% BSA for 30 minutes at room temperature. The blot was then probed with 1 \u03bcg/ml of antibody 252Y in TBS Tw20/1% BSA for 1 hour, washed three times with TBS Tw20, probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse lgG in TBS Tw20/1% BSA for 30 minutes at room temperature, washed three times with TBS Tw20, and detected by autoradiography using ECL. Bands at approximately 8 kD were detected in the 252Y and 252Z lanes but not in the negative isotype-matched control lane. Additionally, MDC was immunprecipitated from cell culture supematants containing RPMI (Rosell Park Memorial Institute - Gibco) medium with 10% fetal bovine serum spiked with 25 ng/ml MDC using the same conditions stated above. \n\n - 76 -</p>F. Humanization of anti-MDC monoclonal antibodies</p>The activities of MDC as reported herein suggest numerous therapeutic indications for MDC inhibitors (antagonists). MDC-neutralizing antibodies (see Example 30) comprise one class of therapeutics useful as MDC antagonists. Following are protocols to improve the utility of anti-MDC monoclonal antibodies as therapeutics in humans, by \"humanizing\" the monoclonal antibodies to improve their serum half-life and render them less immunogenic in human hosts (i.e., to prevent human antibody response to non-human anti-MDC antibodies).</p>The principles of humanization have been described in the literature and are facilitated by the modular arrangement of antibody proteins. To minimize the possibility of binding complement, a humanized antibody ofthe IgG4 isotype is preferred.</p>For example, a level of humanization is achieved by generating chimeric antibodies comprising the variable domains of non-human antibody proteins of interest with the constant domains of human antibody molecules. (See, e.g., Morrison and Oi, Adv. Immunol, 44:65-92 (1989). The variable domains of MDC neutralizing anti-MDC antibo",
    "tration of intracellular calcium was indicated by fluorescence, which was monitored at 510 nm emission wavelength while switching between excitation wavelengths of 340 nm and 380 nm every 0.5 seconds. The ratio ofthe emissions from the 340 nm relative to the 380 mn excitation wavelengths corresponds to the level of intracellular calcium. Cell lines measured by this assay included the following: the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK-293 stably transfected with the putative chemokine receptor gene V28 \n\n - 79 -</p>[Raport et al., Gene, 163:295-299 (1995)]; HEK-293 cells stably transfected with the chemokine receptor gene CCR5 [Samson etal, Biochemistry, 55:3362-3367 (1996); see also co-owned, copending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/575,967, filed December 20, 1995, incorporated herein by reference, disclosing chemokine receptor materials and methods, including CCR5 (identified therein as \"88C\")], the human monocytic cell line THP-1, the human lung epithelial cell line A-549; and the human fibroblast cell line IMR-90. None of these cell lines fluxed calcium in response to the recombinant MDC protein. As positive controls, the HEK-293 transfectants responded strongly to thrombin, indicating that the assay was valid. In addition, the THP-1 cells responded strongly to the commercially available chemokines MCP-1 and MCP-3 (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) at a final concentration of 25 ng/ml. No additional stimuli were tested on the A- 549 or MR-90 cell lines.</p>Example 20</p>Inhibition of HTV proliferation Several CC chemokines have been implicated in suppressing the proliferation of</p>Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), the causative agent of human Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). See Cocchi et al, Science, 270:1811 (1995); Winkler et al, Science, 279:389-393 (1998). The HIV antiproliferative activity of MDC is measured by means such as those described by Cocchi et al, in which a CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell line is acutely infected with an HIV strain and cultured in the presence of various concentrations of MDC. After three days, a fresh dilution of MDC in the culture medium is added to the cells. At 5 to 7 days following infection, the level of HTV is measured by testing the culture supematants for the presence of HIV p24 antigen by a commercial ELISA test (Coulter, Miami, FL).</p>One technical report teaches that MDC possesses an HTV antiproliferative activity. See Pal et al, Science, 278: 695-698 (1997). The agent used in the study consisted of purified polypeptides that had been secreted from an immortalized cell line derived from CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from an HIV- 1 -infected individual. Pal et al. reported that the purified \"native MDC\" from this cell line possessed an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminus corresponding to the tyrosine at position 3 of SEQ ID NO: 1. A \"minor\" sequence beginning with the proline at position 2 of SEQ ID NO: 1 also was detected. The authors did not detect a peptide beginning with the glycine at position 1 of SEQ ID NO: 1 in their \"native MDC\" composition. According to Pal et al, a reversed-phase HPLC fraction \n\n - 80 - containing the \"native MDC\" suppressed the acute infection of CD8<sup>+</sup> cell-depleted PBMCs by HIV-I<sub>JUB</sub> and various NSI HIV isolates in a concentration-dependent fashion. Similar HIV suppressor activity was not observed in supematants from other cell lines that appeared (from Northern blot studies) to demonstrate equivalent MDC gene expression.</p>A. Use of MDC antagonists to inhibit HTV proliferation</p>An acute HIV-l<sub>Bal</sub> infectivity assay reported in Pal et al. was repeated (100 TC_D<sub>50</sub> units/well) using the macrophage cell line PM-1 (1 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well) and using purified mature MDC recombinantly expressed in CHO cells and having an amino acid sequence beginning at position 1 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (see Example 10). Interestingly, mature MDC was found to have no HIV suppressive activity. The same assay was performed with MDC(0-69) (See Example 11), an analog that exhibits properties of a partial MDC antagonist (see Example 19) in that it binds CCR4 with wild-type affinity, but exhibits substantially reduced capacity to induce a calcium flux or induce chemotaxis. At a concentration of 1 \u03bcg/ml, MDC(0-69) conferred a 58% and 67% reduction in the production of infectious particles (TCID<sub>50</sub> units measured on days 5 and 7). The positive control RANTES produced greater than 95% inhibition at 5 ng/ml. Without intending to be limited to a particular theory, one explanation for these results is that mature MDC (1-69) induces HTV proliferation, and that the anti-proliferative effects of MDC(0-69) results from this species competitively inhibiting the capacity of endogenous mature MDC (1-69) to stimulate HTV- 1 production.</p>The effects of mature MDC and of MDC-neutralizing antibodies were analyzed in Pal et \u03b1/.'s acute H_V-l<sub>BaL</sub> (0.01 MOI/well) infectivity assay using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC, 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/well) depleted of CD8<sup>+</sup> cells. The mature MDC (1-69) failed to inhibit p24 production, as compared to a control murine IgGl antibody. However, the murine monoclonal anti-MDC neutralizing antibodies 252Y (IgGl) and 252Z each inhibited p24 production when tested separately at a concentration of 2 \u03bcg/ml (37% and 28% inhibition, respectively). Again, one explanation for these data is that PBMC contain and produce endogenous MDC (1-69) that acts to stimulate HIV-1 functions, and that MDC antagonists inhibit this effect. To confirm the apparent role of MDC as an HIV-1 agonist, an infectivity assay</p>(such as that described in Pal et al) is repeated using MDC neutralizing antibody and titrating \n\n - 81 - exogenous mature MDC(l-69) into the assay wells. If native MDC(l-69) exerts an agonistic effect on HIV-1 infectivity and/or proliferation, then it is expected that the antiviral effect ofthe neutralizing antibody will be reduced with increasing amounts of mature MDC, and will be overwhelmed with the addition of a molar excess of MDC. Collectively, these results provide a therapeutic indication for MDC antagonists for inhibiting proliferation of infectious retroviruses, especially HIV retroviruses. Such therapeutic methods and uses are intended as an aspect ofthe invention. For use in this context, the term \"MDC antagonist\" includes any compound capable of inhibiting HTV-1 proliferation in a manner analogous to MDC neutralizing antibodies, or MDC(0-69), or MDC(3-69). For example, anti-MDC antibodies (especially neutralizing antibodies, and preferably humanized antibodies) are highly preferred MDC antagonists. Similarly, polypeptides that are capable of binding to MDC that comprise an antigen-binding fragment of an anti-MDC antibody are contemplated. Effective MDC analogs also are contemplate",
    "s may be either agonists or antagonists of MDC binding. The following receptor binding assays provide procedures for identifying such MDC modulators.</p>MDC is labelled with a detectable label such as <sup>125</sup>I, <sup>3</sup>H, <sup>14</sup>C, biotin, or Europium. A preparation of cell membranes containing MDC receptors is prepared from natural cells that respond to MDC, such as human macrophages, phorbol ester-stimulated THP-1 cells, human fibroblasts, human fibroblast cell lines, or guinea pig macrophages. (Altematively, a recombinant receptor preparation is made from cells transfected with an MDC receptor cDNA, such as a mammalian cell line transfected with a cDNA encoding CCR4 and expressing CCR4 on its surface.) The membrane preparation is exposed to <sup>125</sup>I-labelled MDC, for example, and incubated under suitable conditions (e.g., ten minutes at 37\u00b0C). The membranes, with any bound <sup>125</sup>I-MDC, are then collected on a filter by vacuum filtration and washed to remove unbound <sup>125</sup>I-MDC. The radioactivity associated with the bound MDC is then quantitated by subjecting the filters to liquid scintillation spectrophotometry.</p>The specificity of MDC binding may be confirmed by repeating the foregoing assay in the presence of increasing quantities of unlabeled MDC, and measuring the level of competition for binding to the receptor. These binding assays also can be employed to identify modulators of MDC receptor binding.</p>The foregoing receptor binding assay also may be performed with the following modification: in addition to labelled MDC, a potential MDC modulator is exposed to the membrane preparation. In this assay variation, an increased level (quantity) of membrane- associated label indicates the potential modulator is an activator of MDC binding; a decreased \n\n - 92 - level (quantity) of membrane-associated label indicates the potential modulator is an inhibitor of MDC receptor binding. This assay can be utilized to identify specific activators and inhibitors of MDC binding from large libraries of chemical compounds or natural products. Rapid screening of multiple modulator candidate compounds simultaneously is specifically contemplated. -</p>Example 27 Assay to identify modulators ofthe MDC/CCR4 interaction The discovery that CCR4 acts as an MDC receptor prompted the development of the following additional assays to identify modulators ofthe interaction between MDC and CCR4. Such assays are intended as aspects ofthe present invention.</p>A. Direct Assay</p>In one embodiment, the invention comprehends a direct assay for modulation (potentiation or inhibition) of MDC-receptor binding. In one direct assay, membrane preparations presenting the chemokine receptor CCR4 in a functional conformation are exposed to either MDC alone or MDC in combination with potential modulators.</p>For suitable membrane preparations, tissue culture cells, such as 293 or K-562 cells (ATCC CRL-1573 and CCL-243, respectively), are transfected with an expression vehicle encoding the MDC receptor CCR4. Cells that express the receptor are selected and cultured, and a membrane preparation is made from the transfected cells expressing the chemokine receptor. By way of example, suitable membrane preparations are made by homogenizing cells in TEM buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 6 mM MgCl 10 \u03bcM PMSF, 1 \u03bcg/ml leupeptin). The homogenate is centrifuged at 800 x g for 10 minutes. The resulting pellet is homogenized again in TEM and re-pelleted. The combined supematants are then centrifuged at 100,000 x g for one hour. The pellets containing the membrane preparations are resuspended in TEM at 1.5 mg/ml.</p>Membrane preparations are exposed to labelled MDC (e.g., MDC labelled with I<sup>125</sup> or other isotope, MDC prepared as an MDC-secreted alkaline phosphatase fusion protein, or MDC labelled in some other manner) either in the presence (experimental) or absence (control) of one or more compounds to be tested for the ability to modulate MDC-receptor binding activity. To practice the assay in standard 96-well plates, an exemplary reaction would",
    "ility to modulate</p>MDC-CCR4 binding and modulate the CCR4-mediated biological activities of MDC.</p>A. Antibodies 252Y and 252Z inhibit MDC binding to CCR4</p>The fusion protein MDC-SEAP (Example 25) was employed to evaluate the ability ofthe antibodies to inhibit MDC binding to its receptor CCR4. MDC-SEAP at a concentration of 0.5 nM was incubated for fifteen minutes at room temperature with varying concentrations (0.01-10 \u03bcg/ml, shown in Fig. 11) of antibody 252Y, antibody 252Z, or an isotype control (final reaction volume 100 \u03bcl). Thereafter, the mixtures were added to CCR4-expressing L1.2 cells</p>(100 \u03bcl, 4000 cells per \u03bcl), and incubated at 4\u00b0C for an additional 60 minutes. The extent of</p>MDC-SEAP binding to the CCR4-expressing cells was determined by alkaline phosphatase chemiluminescent assay as described in Example 25. A baseline level of non-specific binding (defined as the amount of binding that could not be competed by a 200-fold molar excess of native</p>MDC) was determined and subtracted from experimental measurements. Figure 11 presents the experimental results in graphical form, wherein each data point represents a percentage of maximum binding. (Maximum binding was defined as the amount of MDC-SEAP bound to the cells in the absence of antibody, minus non-specific binding.) As shown in Figure 11, both antibody 252Y and antibody 252Z (but not the isotype control) inhibited MDC-SEAP binding to</p>CCR4-infected cells in a dose-dependent manner. Fifty percent inhibition of binding was observed for both antibodies at an antibody concentration of about 2 \u03bcg/ml. \n\n - 102 -</p>B. Antibodies 252Y and 252Z inhibit MDC-induced chemotaxis</p>To confirm that antibodies 252Y and 252Z also were capable of inhibiting CCR4- mediated cellular responses to MDC, both calcium flux and chemotaxis assays were performed using the CCR4-transfected L1.2 cells. For the calcium flux assay, the transfected Ll .2 cells were labelled with Fura-2/AM</p>(see Example 19) and monitored for Ca<sup>++</sup>-induced fluorescence changes using an AMINCO- Bowman Series 2 fluorimeter. Addition of 75 nM MDC to the cells induced a rapid, transient increase in intracellular Ca^ levels. This Ca^ flux response was completely inhibited when either antibody 252 Y or antibody 252Z were added to the cells at a concentration of 10 \u03bcg/ml one minute before contacting the cells with the MDC solution. An isotype-matched control antibody had no effect on the MDC-induced Ca^ flux. Thus, both antibodies blocked the calcium flux response to MDC in CCR4-transfected L1.2 cells.</p>For the chemotaxis assay, CCR4-transfected L1.2 cells (approx. 10 million cells/ml in a volume of 0.1 ml) were preincubated with antibody 252Y, antibody 252Z, or an isotype- matched control in RPMI-1640 media (Gibco) at various concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 50 \u03bcg/ml for 30 minutes at room temperature. Thereafter, the cells were exposed to 100 ng/ml MDC (i.e., the peak concentration for maximum chemotaxis) for 4 hours in a Costar Transwell apparatus. The number of cells migrating toward MDC was counted using a Becton-Dickinson FACScan apparatus. As shown in Figure 12, MDC-induced chemotaxis of these cells was totally inhibited by either antibody 252Y or antibody 252Z at concentrations of 2 - 5 \u03bcg/ml, but not by the isotype-matched control. The IC<sub>50</sub> antibody concentration (required to inhibit 50% migration) was 1 \u03bcg/ml. The same antibodies did not inhibit chemotaxis ofthe CCR4/L1.2 cells toward the C-C chemokine TARC, indicating that the inhibitory effect was specific for MDC.</p>In a similar set of experiments, antibody 272D was screened for its ability to inhibit MDC stimulated chemotaxis. Ten \u03bcg/ml of antibody 272D was required to inhibit chemotaxis toward recombinant MDC (30 ng/ml) by greater than 90%. Only 2 \u03bcg/ml of antibody 252Z was required to achieve a similar level of inhibition, indicating that antibody 252Z is a more potent inhibitor of MDC induced chemotaxis. \n\n - 103 -</p>Example 31</p>MDC induces chemotaxis of T<sub>H</sub>2 helper T cells A transendothelial migration assay was performed essentially as described in the art [Ponath, et al, J. Clin. Invest, 97: 604-612 (1996); Ponath et al, J. Exp. Med, 183: 2437- 2448 (1996); and Imai, et al., Cell, 91:~52\\-530 (1997)] to determine the presence and the phenotype of T cells that migrate toward the chemokines TARC and MDC. Briefly, about 2 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells of the endothelial cell line ECV304 (ATCC CRL-1998 or European Cell Culture Collection, Portions Down, UK) were added to Transwell inserts (Coaster) with a 5 \u03bcm pore size and cultured at 37\u00b0 C for 48-96 hours in Ml 99 medium (GIBCO/BRL) supplemented with 10% FCS. Chemokines were diluted (serial dilutions of 0.1 to 100 nM) in a migration medium (a 1 : 1 mixture of RPMI-1640:M199, supplemented with 0.5% BSA, 20 mMHEPES, pH 7.4) and added to 24-well tissue culture plates in a final volume of 600 \u03bcl. Endothelial cell-coated inserts were placed in each well and 10<sup>6</sup> peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or T cell lines in 100 \u03bcl were added to the upper chambers. The cells were allowed to migrate through the endothelial cells into the lower chambers at 37\u00b0C for 4 hours (PBMC) or 90 minutes (T cell lines). The migrated cells in the lower chambers were stained with FITC- or PE- conjugated monoclonal antibodies (mAb) for ind",
    "i- CCR4 antibody is employed in a standard dose-escalation study to demonstrate efficacy in the treatment of multiple sclerosis in affected human individuals. Exemplary dosing regimens for an antibody-based therapeutic are as set forth in Seciton D, above. Treatment efficacy is determined by monitoring standard MS indices. See, e.g., Kurtzke, J.F., \"Rating neurologic impairment in multiple sclerosis: An expanded disability status scale (EDSS),\" Neurology, 33: 1444 (1983).</p>The biological functions of MDC, elucidated as described above, suggest several clinical applications.</p>Chemokines in general attract and activate monocytes and macrophages (Baggiolini et al, supra), and MDC in particular attracts macrophages and inhibits monocyte chemotaxis. Thus, MDC expression in a pathogenic inflammatory setting may exacerbate disease states by recruiting additional macrophages or other leukocytes to the disease site, by activating the leukocytes that are already there, or by inducing leukocytes to remain at the site. Thus, inhibiting the chemoattractant activity of MDC may be expected to alleviate deleterious inflammatory processes. Significantly, the potential benefits of such an approach have been directly demonstrated in experiments involving IL-8, a C-X-C chemokine that attracts and activates neutrophils. Antibodies directed against IL-8 have a profound ability to inhibit \n\n - 110 - inflammatory disease mediated by neutrophils [Harada et al, J. Leukoc. Biol, 56:559 (1994)].</p>Inhibition of MDC is expected to have a similar effect in diseases in which macrophages are presumed to play a role, e.g., Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or atherosclerosis.</p>Altematively, augmenting the effect of MDC may have a beneficial role in such diseases, as chemokines have also been shown to have a positive effect in wound healing and angiogenesis. Thus, exogenous MDC or MDC agonists may be beneficial in promoting recovery from such diseases.</p>In addition, the myelosuppressive effect demonstrated for the C-C chemokine</p>MlP-l\u03b1 (Maze et al, supra) suggests that MDC may have a similar activity. Such activity, provided by MDC or MDC agonists, may yield substantial benefits for patients receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy, reducing the deleterious effects ofthe therapy on the patient's myeloid progenitor cells.</p>MDC or MDC agonists may also prove to be clinically important in the treatment of tumors, as suggested by the ability ofthe C-C chemokine TCA3 to inhibit tumor formation in mice (see Laning et al, supra). MDC may act directly or indirectly to inhibit tumor formation, e.g., by attracting and activating various non-specific effector cells to the tumor site or by stimulating a specific anti-tumor immunity. The fibroblast-antiproliferative effect of MDC indicates a therapeutic utility for MDC in the treatment of diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis and tumors, in which enhanced or uncontrolled cell proliferation is a major feature.
