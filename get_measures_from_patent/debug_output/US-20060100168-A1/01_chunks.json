    "ity A3AR, so that only a high concentration of IB-MECA can activate a relevant downstream signaling. Indeed, MCF-7 only had a very low level of A3AR expression (FIG. 4A), as endogenous A3AR mRNA could barely be detected after 33 cycles of RT-PCR reactions (data not shown). If the growth inhibition by IB-MECA was mediated by low level expression of A3AR in MCF-7 cells, overexpression of the human A3AR would increase the sensitivity of cells upon IB-MECA treatment. To explore this possibility, MCF-7 cells were stably transfected with human A3AR cDNA. Expression of A3AR in a stable transfection pool could be strongly detected with 27 cycles of RT-PCR reactions (FIG. 4A), and was stronger than the expression level in the brain, where A3AR is abundantly expressed (data not shown). The percentage of cells in the transfection pool that contain the transgene was estimated by analyzing single clones selected from the pool of cells. 16 out of 17 clones showed strong increased expression of A3AR (data not shown), verifying that majority of the cells within the transfection pool overexpressed A3AR. The pool of stably transfected cells were compared to normal MCF-7 cells in soft agar assays. FIG. 4B shows that the two types of cells have almost identical dosage response to IB-MECA. Increased expression did not lower the concentration of IB-MECA needed to induce growth suppression. In accordance, the selective A3AR antagonist MRS1191 used at a concentration of up to 1 \u03bcM (greater than its Ki) did not abolish IB-MECA inhibitory effect on growth of MCF-7 cells (not shown). Thus, we concluded that the growth inhibition by IB-MECA is not mediated through A3AR. </p> IB-MECA treatment decreases estrogen receptor a in MCF-7 cells: The data described above indicated that IB-MECA inhibits cell cycle progression primarily at the G1/S transition. Since estrogen receptor activation is known to promote cell cycle progression though G1/S and enhance both anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent growth of breast cancer cells, we asked whether ER\u03b1 is a primary target of IB-MECA. To this end, the expression of endogenous ER\u03b1 mRNA was analyzed with semi-quantitative RT-PCR in MCF-7 cells treated with IB-MECA. A decrease in the expression of ER\u03b1 could be consistently detected at 6 hours post IB-MECA treatment, compared to GAPDH expression (FIG. 5A). A dramatic decrease of ER\u03b1 could be detected after 12 hours and 24 hours of treatment. This result shows that IB-MECA treatment can either reduce transcription driven by the ER\u03b1 promoter gene or affect the stability of ER\u03b1 mRNA. Detailed mechanism of this downregulation is under investigation. </p> As a consequence of a downregulation of ER\u03b1 mRNA, ER\u03b1 protein should also show a time-dependent decrease in IB-MECA-treated cells. Indeed, Western blot analyses indicated that ER\u03b1 protein in MCF-7 cells decreased after IB-MECA treatment, and this decrease occurred before the reduction in cyclin levels (FIG. 5B), suggesting that ER\u03b1 do"
