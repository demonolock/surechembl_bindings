Lymphomas include, but are not limited to, lymphoblastoid lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), mucosa-associated lymphoid tumors (MALT), mantle cell lymphoma, diffuse small cleaved cell lymphoma, anaplastic large cell lymphoma, Ki-1 lymphoma, adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma, immunoblastic NHL, small noncleaved NHL, Burkitt's lymphoma, K-1 anaplastic large cell lymphoma, diffuse large cell NHL, lymphoblastic NHL, T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma, mycosis fungoides, and Sezary syndrome.</p>The word \u201cleukemia\u201d is intended to encompass a malignant neoplasm of a blood-forming tissue or tissues. Leukemias include but are not limited to, acute leukemias such as but not limited to, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), acute myeloid leukemia, acute myelocytic leukemia, acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), chronic leukemias such as but not limited to, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic lymphatic leukemia, B-cell CLL, T-cell CLL, prolymphocytic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia, chronic myelocytic leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelomonocytic and chronic granulocytic leukemia.</p>Kits and methods of the application may involve evaluating expression of at least a first biomarker, second biomarker and third biomarker selected from a lymphoma related biomarker panel comprising TNFRSF8, FSCN1, BCL6 and PIM1 and may involve evaluating expression of a fourth biomarker selected from a lymphoma related biomarker panel comprising TNFRSF8, FSCN1, BCL6 and PIM1.

The phrase \u201clymphoma related biomarker panel\u201d is intended to encompass a biomarker panel comprising biomarkers linked to lymphoma, leukemia or a symptomatically similar disorder. It is envisioned that each lymphoma related biomarker in a panel may be assayed by a distinct method or by similar methods. In non-limiting examples each compound in panel may be assayed by the same method, one compound may be assayed by one method while the remainder are assayed by a different method, two or more compounds in the panel may be assayed by one method while the remainder are assayed by a different method, two or more compounds in the panel may be assayed by distinct methods while the remainder are assayed by one similar method, or each compound may be assayed by a distinct method. A preferred lymphoma related biomarker panel of the instant application comprises at least three lymphoma related biomarkers selected from the group consisting of TNFRSF8, FSCN1, BCL6 and PIM1. Another preferred lymphoma related biomarker panel of the instant application comprises at least four lymphoma related biomarkers selected from the group consisting of TNFRSF8, FSCN1, BCL6 and PIM1.</p>\u201cTNFRSF8\u201d, also known as TNR8, TNFR8, Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily 8, CD30, CD30L receptor, Ki-1 antigen, lymphocyte activation antigen CD-30, CD_antigen=CD30, TNFRSF8, and D1S166E, Uniprot ProtID P28908 and RefSeq ID NM<sub>\u2014</sub>001234, is intended to encompass a nucleic acid molecule having the nucleotide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:1, a nucleic acid molecule having a nucleotide sequence complementary to the nucleotide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:1, a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:2, and a nucleic acid molecule that encodes a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:2. A TNFRSF8 nucleic acid molecule is a 3686 nucleotide nucleic acid molecule having the nucleotide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:1. Preferred fragments of a TNFRSF8 nucleic acid molecule may include but are not limited to, regions of nucleic acid molecules suitable for amplification, suitable primer binding regions and suitable probe binding regions. Fragments of a TNFRSF8 nucleic acid molecule that may be useful in the current methods include fragments comprising up to 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 210, 220, 230, 240, 250, 260, 270, 280, 290, 300, 310, 320, 330, 340, 350, 360, 370, 380, 390, 400, 410, 420, 430, 440, 450, 460, 470, 480, 490, 500, 510, 520, 530, 540, 550, 560, 570, 580, 590, 600, 610, 620, 630, 640, 650, 660, 670, 680, 690, 700, 710, 720, 730, 740, 750, 760, 770, 780, 790, 800, 810, 820, 830, 840, 850, 860, 870, 890, 9"
