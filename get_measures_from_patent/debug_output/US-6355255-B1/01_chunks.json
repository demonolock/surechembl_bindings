NO:22)</p>These sets of PCR primers were used in three separate reactions. The template DNA was pLP605, which contained the wild-type scpA1 sequence. The PCR products were subsequently self-ligated and transformed into the E. coli strain Top10F\u2032 (Invitrogen, Inc.). Transformants were screened for the appropriate size and restriction pattern. The sequence change in the S512A variant destroys a unique SpeI restriction site so that this mutation could be identified directly by restriction analysis. All potential variants were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Subsequently, the D130A mutation was combined with the S512A mutation to form a double variant utilizing a unique PstI site between these two regions of the protein. The final alteration was to change the antibiotic selection from ampicillin to kanamycin by moving the variant scpA1 genes to a previously altered pTRC99a vector (Pharnacia, Inc.) containing the kanamycin gene.</p>A variant of SCPB protein was constructed using the method described above for SCPA1 mutants. The wild-type SCPB gene was cloned from group B streptococcus 78-471 (Typc IIa<sup>+</sup>).</p>EXAMPLE 7Analysis of Variant ProteinsProteins expressed from each of the variant constructs were analyzed by SDS polyacrylamidc gel electrophoresis. The expected size of the protein is 121 kD, however, the proline-rich cell wall spanning domain at the carboxy terminus of the enzyme causes the protein to run slightly slower during SDS-PAGE. Therefore the apparent molecular weight is 130 kD when determined by SDS-PAGE. Since active SCP could be harmful to the host, it was important that the variant proteins lacked enzymatic activity. Two properties of the variant proteins were evaluated. The specific activities of the wild-type and variant proteins as determined by PMN adherence assay are compared in Table 7. These experiments indicated that the substituted amino acids reduced enzymatic activity by greater than 90%.</p>TABLE 7PMN adherence assay determination of variant protease activityProteinActivity (U/mg*10<sup>\u22123</sup>)Wild-type170SCPA49D130A&lt;20SCPA49N295A&lt;20SCPA49S512A&lt;20</p>The variant proteins were also compared to the wild-type protein for their capacity to bind antibody directed against the wild-type enzyme. Competitive ELISA assays were used for this purpose. Competitive ELISAs measured the inhibition of antibody binding to immobilized antigen by soluble antigen. A constant amount of wild-type antigen was bound to wells of the microtiter plate. A constant amount of antibody is added at the same time with varying amounts of soluble competitive antigen. The slope of the percent inhibition versus antigen concentration curves estimate the relative binding affinity of the soluble antigen for antibody. While the binding conantnts cannot be calculated without knowing the exact concentration of anti-SCPA in the antiscim, the relative binding affinities of several proteins were compared (FIG. 11).
