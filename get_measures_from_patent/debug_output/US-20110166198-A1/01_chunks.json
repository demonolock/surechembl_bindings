    "se RNA strand, and the antisense RNA strand is 18-30 nucleotides in length. In another embodiment, the iRNA agent includes a nucleotide overhang having 1 to 4 unpaired nucleotides, which may be at the 3\u2032-end of the antisense RNA strand, and the nucleotide overhang may have the nucleotide sequence 5\u2032-GC-3\u2032 or 5\u2032-CGC-3\u2032. The unpaired nucleotides may have at least one phosphorothioate dinucleotide linkage, and at least one of the unpaired nucleotides may be chemically modified in the 2\u2032-position. In one embodiment, the double strand region of the candidate iRNA agent includes phosphorothioate linkages on one or both of the sense and antisense strands. In a preferred embodiment, the candidate iRNA agent includes phosphorothioate linkages between nucleotides 1 through 5 of the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 end of the sense or antisense agent.</p>In one embodiment, the antisense RNA strand and the sense RNA strand are connected with a linker. The chemical linker may be a hexaethylene glycol linker, a poly-(oxyphosphinico-oxy-1,3-propandiol) linker, an allyl linker, or a polyethylene glycol linker. Use of a linker to connect the antisense and sense strands, will inhibit strand separation in vivo, thereby inhibiting immunostimulation.</p>In another embodiment, one or more modifications of a candidate immunoselective iRNA agent can increase the ratio of double-stranded to single-stranded iRNA agent in a biological system (e.g., in the blood stream or in serum samples). Such modifications may decrease the dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) between the sense and antisense strands. In some embodiments, the modification that increases the ratio of double-stranded to single-stranded iRNA agent in a biological system is a chemical linker, such as a hexaethylene glycol linker, poly-(oxyphosphinico-oxy-1,3-propandiol) linker, allyl linker, or polyethylene glycol linker that binds the two strands together. In one embodiment, the linker includes an ester, and the linker can be cleaved by an esterase. In some embodiments, the modification is a high affinity chemical modification, such as 2\u2032-F, LNA, ENA, 2\u2032-O-MOE, and C-5-propynyl pyrimidines or G-clamp and its analogs. In yet other embodiments, the modification is a chemical crosslink, e.g., a disulfide containing crosslink.</p>In another embodiment, the immunoselective iRNA agent can include at least two modifications. The modifications can differ from one another, and may be applied to different RNA strands of a double-stranded iRNA agent. For example, the sense strand can include at least one modification, and the antisense strand can include a modification that differs from the modification or modifications on the sense strand. In another example, the sense strand can include at least two different modifications, and the antisense strand can include at least one modification that differs from the two different modifications on the sense strand. Accordingly, the sense strand can include multiple different modifications, and the an",
    "o those skilled in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,811; PCT publication WO 91/06309; and European patent publication EP-A-43075, which are incorporated by reference herein.</p>Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of iRNA agent can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. iRNA agents that exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred.</p>The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosages of compositions of the invention are preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any iRNA agent used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range of the iRNA agent or, when appropriate, of the polypeptide product of a target sequence (e.g., achieving a decreased concentration of the polypeptide) that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test iRNA agent which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.</p>In addition to their administration individually or as a plurality, as discussed above, iRNA agents relating to the invention can be administered in combination with other known agents effective in treating viral infections and diseases. In any event, the administering physician can adjust the amount and timing of iRNA agent administration on the basis of results observed using standard measures of efficacy known in the art or described herein.</p>For oral administration, the iRNA agent useful in the invention will generally be provided in the form of tablets or capsules, as a powder or granules, or as an aqueous solution or suspension.</p>The pharmaceutical compositions encompassed by the invention may be administered by any means known in the art including, but not limited to, oral or parenteral routes, including intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, transdermal, airway (aerosol), ocular, rectal, vaginal, and topical (including buccal and sublingual) administration. In preferred embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered by intravenous or intraparenteral infusion or injection. The pharmaceutical compositions can also be administ"
