During peak season (mid-September to mid-October) however, rhinoviruses account for up to 75% of all colds. Approximately 90% of all rhinoviruses bind to a major human rhinovirus receptor (HRR). An antiviral agent comprising the human major rhinovirus receptor or fragments thereof is an effective inhibitor of rhinoviral infection of susceptible cells. The human major rhinovirus receptor is the same as the protein known as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), with the exception of a G&gt;A at nucleotide 1462, resulting in the amino acid substitution Glu&gt;Lys at amino acid position 442. ICAM-1 is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 45-50 kD (excluding carbohydrate) and 8 potential sites for N-linked carbohydrate attachment; the glycosylated protein has a molecular weight of 82-88 kD. ICAM-1 has 507 amino acids and consists of a cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane domain, and five extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains (amino acids 1-88, 89-185, 186-284, 285-385, and 386-453). The presently preferred embodiment for antiviral purposes is a fragment consisting of the first 453 amino acids of the full HRR sequence, which retains rhinovirus binding activity.</p>Recombinant tICAM(453) was purified from fermentation fluid of continuous cell culture of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells containing cDNA coding for tICAM(453) maintained by continuous perfusion in a customized medium free of all plasma-derived components. By \u201ctICAM(453)\u201d is meant the first 453 amino acids (domains 1-5) of ICAM-1. The sequence for ICAM-1 is known to those skilled in the art, as are methods of preparing the cDNA coding for tICAM(453). See, e.g,, Staunton, D. E., S. D. Marlin, C. Stratowa, M. L. Dustin, and T. A. Springer, \u201cPrimary Structure of ICAM-1 Demonstrates Interaction Between Members of the Immunoglobulin and Integrin Supergene Families\u201d, Cell 52:925-933 (1988); European Patent Application Pulbication No. 362,531.tICAM(453) obtained from clarified and concentrated fermentation fluid was purified by hydrophobic chromatography, metal ion chromatography, precipitation at low pH, filtration, anion exchange chromatography, hydroxyapatite adsorption, size exclusion chromatography, and a second HAP adsorption step. Viral inactivation was accomplished via low pH precipitation (de"
