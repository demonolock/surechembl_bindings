    "ate buffer pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 100,000Xg to recover membranes in that phase. The pellet is resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and consists of 3-4 fold enriched plasma membranes as well as some other cell membranes (e.g. lysosomes, Golgi). The membranes are aliquoted and stored at -80\u00b0C. Fractionation at 6.6 % Dextran/PEG yields plasma membranes enriched 10-fold.</p>The fractionated membranes are incubated at 37\u00b0C for times up to 4 hrs to produce fragments of CD23 which are separated from the membrane by filtration in 0.2 micron Durapore filter plates (Millipore) after quenching the assay with a non-selecitve MMP inhibitor, e.g. 5 uM Preparation 1 from WO 95/31457 ([4-(N-Hydroxyamino)-2-(R)-isobutyl-3-(S)-(2-thiophenethiomethyl)succinyl]-(S)-phenylalanine-N-methylamide sodium salt, prepared according to the procedure described in Example 11 of WO 90/05719). sCD23 released from the membrane is determined using the EIA kit from The Binding Site (Birmingham, UK) or a similar one utilising MHM6 anti-CD23 mAb [Rowe et al., Int. J. Cancer, 29, 373-382 (1982)] or another anti-CD23 mAb as the capture antibody in a sandwich EIA.. The amount of soluble CD23 made by 0.5 ug membrane protein in a total volume of 50 ul phosphate-buffered saline is measured by EIA and compared to the amount made in the presence of various concentrations of inhibitors. Inhibitors are prepared in solutions of water or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and the final DMSO concentration is not more than 2 %. IC50's are determined by curve fitting as the concentration where 50 % inhibition of production of sCD23 is observed relative to the difference in sCD23 between controls incubated without inhibitor.</p>ResultsThe compound of Example 1 showed an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.06uM</p>Procedure 2: The ability of test compounds to inhibit matrix metalloproteases was investigated using the following procedures.Collagenase inhibition assay:The potency of compounds to act as inhibitors of collagenase was determined by the method of Cawston and Barrett (Anal. Biochem. 99, 340-345, 1979), hereby incorporated by reference, whereby a 1 mM solution of the inhibitor being tested or dilutions thereof, was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 18 h with collagen and human recombinant collagenase, from synovial fibroblasts cloned, expressed and purified from E. Coli, (buffered with 150 mM Tris, pH 7.6, containing 15 mM calcium chloride, 0.05% Brij 35, 200 mM sodium chloride and 0.02% sodium azide). The collagen was acetylated <sup>3</sup>H type 1 bovine collagen prepared by the method of Cawston and Murphy (methods in Enzymology 80, 711,1981) The samples were centrifuged to sediment undigested collagen and an aliquot of the radioactive supernatant removed for assay on a scintillation counter as a measure of hydrolysis. The collagenase activity in the presence of 1mM inhibitor, or dilution thereof, was compared to activity in a control devoid of inhibitor and the results reported as that concentration effecting 50% of the collagenase (IC<sub>50</sub>).</p>ResultsThe compound of Example 1 showed an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 100uM in procedure 2.</p>General MMP inhibition assays:Inhibition of matrix metalloprotease activity was determined using a fluorescence quench assay with appropriate substrate. For example, MMP activity was determined using MMP activated using trypsin, according to Lark et al, Connective Tissue Res. 25, 52 (1990). The MMP is incubated at room temperature in a microtitre plate in a total volume of 100 ul, containing 0.15 M Tris Cl, 15 mM CaCl2, 0.2 M NaCl, pH 7.6 (assay buffer); inhibitor at concentrations up to 100 uM, with no more than 2 % DMSO final concentration, 10 uM substrate (such as SDP-3815-PI for MMP-1, Peptides International). The MMP concentration is &lt; 10 nM, and determined empirically with the appropriate substrate to give at least a 20-fold increase in fluorescence emission in 30 min. Fluorescent excitation wavelength was 355 nm, emission wavelength 400-460 nm, and data points are collected to generate slope (change in fluorescence with time). Percent inhibition for each concentration is calculated from the slope at time zero, and IC50 values from the concentration dependence. MMP-1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 13, 14 may all be assayed in the same manner, using commercially available substrates reported to be effective for each enzyme. Enzymes were obtained from Calbiochem and activated using the same trypsin method.</p>ResultsThe compound of Example 1 showed an IC<sub>50</sub> value of &gt;100uM vs MMP-3, and 6.0uM vs MMP-13.</p>AbbreviationsBn - BenzylEtOAc - ethyl acetateh - hourmin - minutesMCPBA - meta chloroperoxybenzoic acidMDC - Dichloromethanert - Room temperatureTHF - Tetrahydrofuran</p>"
