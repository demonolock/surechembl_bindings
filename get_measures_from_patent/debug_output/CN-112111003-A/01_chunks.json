    "\u03b1 granule release marker) and serotonin (5-HT, platelet dense granule release marker). The effect of dipeptide ME on the release of platelet granules is shown in figure 3, and the experimental result shows that the dipeptide ME inhibits the release of platelet alpha granule beta-TG and platelet dense granule 5-HT in a dose-dependent manner, and the inhibition effect on the release of the dense granules is stronger than the inhibition effect on the release of alpha granules.</p>(2) Dipeptide ME on platelet intracellular free Ca<sup>2+</sup>Influence of concentration</p>Determination of Ca by means of dual-wavelength fluorescence colorimetry<sup>2+</sup>And (4) concentration. The normal group, the sample group and the model group were set according to the method of example 2, incubated at 37 \u2103 for 5min in the dark, and then induced for 5min by adding thrombin to perform fluorescence detection. The excitation wavelength is respectively fixed at 340nm and 380nm, the wave width is 5nm, the emission wavelength is fixed at 510nm and the wave width is 5nm, the fluorescence intensity ratio R (F340/F380) measured at the excitation wavelength of 340nm and 380nm of each group is recorded, then Triton X-100 (the final concentration is 0.1 percent) is added to measure R<sub>max</sub>And then EGTA (final concentration 3mM) was added to determine R<sub>min</sub>According to the following formulaCalculation of platelet intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>And (4) concentration.</p>[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i\uff1dKd\u00d7(R-R<sub>min</sub>)/(Rmax-R)\u00d7SFB</p>Wherein Kd is Fura-2/AM and Ca<sup>2+</sup>The dissociation constant of the reaction is 224nmol/L, and R is the ratio of the fluorescence intensity of F340 to F380 at each measurement point. SFB is the ratio between F380, which constitutes Rmin and Rmax. The measurement results are shown in FIG. 4, and the dipeptide ME can inhibit the mobilization of calcium ions in platelets at a certain concentration.</p>(3) Target point verification and molecular action mechanism of dipeptide ME</p>Washed platelets were prepared according to the method of example 2, potential targets were screened using phosphorylated antibody chips, and Western Blot was performed for differentially expressed proteins. The target protein for the action of ME was initially determined to be G.alpha.q. Further target validation experiments are as follows.</p>And (3) putting 270 mu L of washed platelets into a test cup, respectively putting the washed platelets into a platelet aggregation instrument with different concentrations of A4, U73122 or a desktop solution, incubating for 4min at 37 \u2103, transferring the platelet aggregation instrument into a test channel, adding thrombin (0.5U/mL) to induce platelet aggregation, and measuring the platelet aggregation rate within 3 min. Meanwhile, using YM254890 as a positive control, platelets that were not treated with inhibitor and agonist were set as a normal group. And (3) centrifuging 750 Xg of the platelets treated by the inhibitor and A4 for 1min, collecting platelet precipitates, adding RIPA lysate (containi"
