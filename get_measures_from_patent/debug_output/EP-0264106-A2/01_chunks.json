A preferred range of a daily dose for oral administration is from about 0.1 mg/kg to 500 mg/kg, and such a daily dose may be amdinistered at once or in three times a day. For non-oral administration, it is preferred to administer the compound of the present invention in an amount of from about 0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg per day at once. The dose may be increased or reduced by a doctor's prescription depending upon e.g. the sex and diseased condition of the patient.</p>Now, the present invention will be described in further detail with reference to the Test Example for renin inhibiting activities of the compounds of the present invention and Working Examples.</p>Test Example for renin inhibiting activities:To 156 \u00b5l of a 0.2M sodium phosphate buffer solution (pH7.4), 40 \u00b5l of a solution mixture of 34mM 8-hydroxyquinoline and 100mM disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate, 4 \u00b5l of dimethyl sulfoxide or a dimethyl sulfoxide solution of an inhibitor and 200 \u00b5l of human plasma were added and reacted at 37\u00b0C for one hour. Then, pepstatin was added thereto to terminate the reaction, and the amount of the resulting angiotension I was measured by radio immunoassay whereby the inhibiting activity was determined. The 50% inhibition concentrations (IC\u2085\u2080 values) of the compounds of the present invention are shown below.\n<img id=\"ib0034\" path=\"imgb0034.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/175446977/EP/19880420/A2/000000/26/41/06/imgb0034.tif\"/></p>Among the compounds disclosed in the above mentioned Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 122,296/1986 and Japanese Unexamined PCT Publication No. 500,415/1986, a derivative having an isopropyl group at the 2-position of the homostatin structure is believed to have the strongest inhibiting activity. Therefore, this derivative i.e. the above-identified comparative compound was synthesized, and the renin inhibiting activity thereof was measured and compared with the activities of the compounds of the present invention. As is evident from the foregoing, the compounds of the present invention have activities higher by about ten times than the comparative compound. Thus, the superiority of the compounds of the present invention have been proven.</p>Now, the present invention will be described with reference to Examples. However, it should be understood that the present invention is by no means restricted by these specific Examples.</p>EXAMPLE 1Statin111 g of pepstatin was dissolved in 1 liter of concentrated hydrochloric acid and hydrolyzed at a temperature of from 37\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C for two days. The solution was diluted 30 times with 25% water-containing methanol and then passed through a column of Dawex 50\u00ae (H\u207a-type, 50-100 mesh, 2.5 liters). The column was wash"
