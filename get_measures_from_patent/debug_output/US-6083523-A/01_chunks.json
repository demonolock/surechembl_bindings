    " of 900 microns outer diameter, implanted into the peritoneal cavity (pO2\u224845-50 mmHg), the optimal total cell volume is in the range of up to 20%, preferably 1-15%, most preferably about 5% of the vehicle volume. If this capsule were 20 cm in length it would have a volume of 100 mm<sup>3</sup>. To provide the same amount of surface area with a single sphere, e.g. to support comparable amounts of tissue, would require a volume of 1,047 mm<sup>3</sup>.</p>For a cylindrical vehicle of 400 microns the optimal cell volume is between 35-65% total vehicle volume, and is preferably 35%. These calculations also take into account the partial oxygen pressure at the site of implantation. At implantation sites where the oxygen pressure is less than the peritoneum (e.g., subcutaneous pO2\u224820 mmHg), lower loading densities will be required. Implantation into arteries (pO2\u226795 mmHg) and the brain (pO2&gt;75 mmHg) will allow support of greater tissue volume per unit vehicle.</p>Other vehicle configurations, such as disk-shaped or spherical, are also possible and optimal cell volumes may be similarly calculated for these geometries. Actual loading densities will consider not only these diffusional considerations but also the other considerations given below.</p>With respect to the second factor (cell division), if the cells selected are expected to be actively dividing while in the vehicle, then they will continue to divide until they fill the available space, or until phenomena such as contact inhibition limit further division. For replicating cells, the geometry and size of the vehicle will be chosen so that complete filling of the vehicle core will not lead to deprivation of critical nutrients due to diffusional limitations. In general, vehicles that will be filled to confluency with cells or tissue will be no more than 250 microns in cross-section, such that cells in the interior will have less than 15 cells between them and an external diffusional surface, preferably less than 10 cells and more preferably less than 5 cells.</p>In general, for cells not expected to divide within the vehicle, such as chromaffin cells, pancreatic islet cells and the like, the appropriate cell densities will be calculated from the diffusional considerations listed above.</p>With respect to the third factor (viscosity of core materials) cells in densities occupying up to 70% of the vehicle volume can be viable, but cell solutions in this concentration range would have considerable viscosity. Introduction of cells in a very viscous solution into the vehicle could be prohibitively difficult. In general, for both two step and coextrusion strategies, discussed below, cell loading densities of higher than 30% will seldom be useful, and in general optimal loading densities will be 20% and below. For fragments of tissues, it is important, in order to preserve the viability of interior cells, to observe the same general guidelines as above and tissue fragments should not exceed 250 microns ",
    "ctor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), an array of fibroblast growth factors, and ciliary neurotrophic factor.</p>Alternatively, one or more biologically active molecules may be delivered into the capsule. For example, the capsule may contain one or more cells or substances which \"scavenge\" cholesterol, or other biological factors, from the host.</p>Techniques and procedures for isolating cells or tissues which produce a selected product are known to those skilled in the art, or can be adapted from known procedures with no more than routine experimentation. For example, islets of Langerhans can be isolated from a large-animal pancreas (e.g., human or porcine) using a combination of mechanical distention and collagenase digestion, as described by Scharp, D. W., et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,868,121. Islets may be isolated from small animals such as rats by the method of Scharp, et al., Diabetes 29, suppl. 1, pp. 19-30 (1980). Similarly, hepatocytes can be isolated from liver tissue using collagenase digestion followed by tissue fractionation, as described by Sun, A. M., et al., Biomat., Art. Cells, Art. Org., 15, pp. 483-496 (1987). Adrenal Chromaffin cells may be isolated by the method of Livett, B. G., Physiology Reviews, 64, pp. 1103-1161 (1984).</p>Many cellular products which are difficult to provide using primary donor tissues can be provided using immortalized cells or cell lines. Immortalized cells are those which are capable of indefinite replication but which exhibit contact inhibition upon confluence and are not tumorigenic. An example of an immortalized cell line is the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12. Transformed cells or cell lines can be used in a similar manner. Transformed cells are unlike merely immortalized cells in that they do not exhibit contact inhibition upon confluence, and form tumors when implanted into an allogeneic host. Immortalization can allow the use of rare or notoriously fragile cell or tissue types for the long-term delivery of a chosen product or metabolic function. Suitable techniques for the immortalization of cells are described in Land H. et al., Nature 304, pp. 596-602 (1983) and Cepko, C. L., Neuron 1, pp. 345-353 (1988). Candidate cell lines include genetically engineered beta-cell lines which secrete insulin such as NIT cells (Hamaguchi, K., et al., Diabetes 40, p. 842 (1991)), RIN cells (Chick, W. L., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 74, pp. 628-632 (1977)), ATT cells (Hughes, S. D., et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89, pp. 688-692 (1992)), CHO cells (Matsumoto, M., et al, 1990, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 87, pp. 9133-9137 (1990)), and beta-TC-3 cells (Tal, M., et al, 1992, Mol. Cell Biol., 12, pp. 422-432 (1992)). Additionally, recombinant cells or cell lines can be engineered to provide novel products or functions and combinations thereof, using a wide variety of techniques well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.</p>For example, fibroblasts can be transfected with an expression vector for the chosen product (e.g., nerve growth factor, erythropoietin, insulin, or Factor VIII). It should be recognized however, that expression of a recombinant protein in a cell type which does not normally express the protein may lead to unregulated expression which may not be desirable for cert",
    "n and subsequent restoration of normoglycemia to a diabetic individual. This method of preparing the cells prior to immunoisolation is thought to remove antigen presenting cells from the islet tissue thus diminishing immunologic attraction to the outside of the vehicle which could limit its function and duration.</p>EXAMPLE 2: Formation of Hydrogel Matrices With Different Molecular Weight Cutoffs</p>An alginate thin film made from a solution of 1.0% w/v sodium alginate in H<sub>2</sub> O was cross-linked for 6 minutes using either (1) a 1.0% (w/v) or (2) a 2.0% (w/v) aqueous CaCl<sub>2</sub> solution. The sheet was made by placing a film of liquid on a glass plate using a draw down blade with a 0.2 mm clearance, then immersing in the aqueous CaCl<sub>2</sub> solution. A disk was cut from the film using a 47 mm cutting die. The disk was placed in an Amicon stirred filtration cell and used to filter solutions of several marker solutes under a pressure of 10 psi. The concentration of the marker solute was measured in the retentate (C<sub>r</sub> =average of initial and final retentate concentration) and similarly in the bulked permeate (C<sub>p</sub>). The rejection coefficient of each hydrogel was calculated as follows:</p>R=1-C.sub.p /C.sub.r</pre></p>Thus, a solute which is completely rejected would have a coefficient of 1, and conversely, one which is completely passed through the hydrogel would have a coefficient of 0. The hydrogel resulting from (1) was permeable to 2,000 kD Dextran (Poly Sciences corp.) (rejection coefficient equal to 0.64). The hydrogel resulting from (2) was nearly impermeable to the same Dextran solution. FIG. 1 describes permeability of the two hydrogels to the following additional solutes. Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA; ICN Biochemicals), Vitamin B12 (ICN Biochemicals), \u03b1-chymotrypsin (ICN Biochemicals), Apoferritin (Sigma). The approximate molecular weights are given in parenthesis in FIG. 1.</p>EXAMPLE 3: Formation Of A Dual-Matrix Immunoisolatory Vehicle</p>A 2% solution of sodium alginate in physiological saline (PS; 150 mm NaCl) was prepared under sterile conditions. A sterile suspension of pancreatic islets in CRML1066 (GIBCO) culture media isolated from adult rats was diluted 1:1 with the alginate solution, for a final concentration of 1% alginate in the islet suspension. The islet suspension was extruded from a single chamber extrusion nozzle into a 1% CaCl<sub>2</sub> bath. Once the alginate polyions were crosslinked (approx. 2 min.) and the core containing immobilized islets formed, the core was placed in a 2% alginate solution. The core was then drawn up into tubing with a diameter approximately 500 microns larger then the core and reextruded into a second crosslinking bath of 2% alginate, surrounding the core with a jacket formed of a separate cell-free layer of alginate matrix cross-linked to the core. The thus formed macrocapsule was cylindrical with dimensions of 30 mm length, 800 mm core diameter, and 1 mm di",
    " Formation Of Core Matrix, Permselective Membrane Immunoisolatory Vehicle BY Coextrusion</p>A suspension of rat islets in 1% alginate was prepared as described in Example 3 and loaded into the inner chamber of the coextrusion device. The outer chamber was loaded with a membrane casting solution comprising 12.5% (w/w) PAN/PVC in DMSO (i.e., dimethyl sulfoxide). The tip of the nozzle was either positioned at a fixed distance above, or immersed in, a bath containing a sterile solution of 1% CaCl<sub>2</sub> in PS, which induced the hardening or gelling of the alginate core matrix, and simultaneously induced the hardening of the casting solution into a permselective membrane. The exterior surface characteristics of the vehicle were determined by whether the nozzle had been positioned above or below the surface of the bath. When the nozzle was positioned above the bath and exposed to low relative humidity (RH) air, an anisotropic membrane with a rough, coriaceous (i.e., leathery) external surface was formed, but when the nozzle was immersed in the bath, a membrane-bilayer with a smooth external surface was formed. Alternatively, when the nozzle was placed above the bath and the fiber exposed to high RH air, an intermediate was formed. The materials loaded into the chambers were coextruded into this bath, generating a continuously forming cylindrical vehicle, comprising a core region of alginate matrix-immobilized islets and a surrounding semipermeable membrane having a MWCO of 50 kD.</p>The relative thickness of the membrane was modified by adjusting the relative velocity of extrusion from the bores, as described in Example 3. The ends of the cylinder were sealed using methods similar to those described in the copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/461,999 filed Jan. 8, 1990, the teachings of which are herein incorporated by reference. The immunoisolatory vehicle so formed was maintained in sterile PS, a balanced salt solution or tissue culture medium prior to implantation.</p>EXAMPLE 6: Formation Of Core Matrix, Permselective Membrane Immunoisolatory Vehicle By \"Hand Loading\"</p>In other cases, the islets were suspended in a 1-2% alginate solution, and \"hand loaded\" into preformed thermoplastic hollow fibers using a syringe and the ends of the fibers were sealed by a combination of heat and polymer glue precipitation as described in copending U.S. Ser. No. 07/461,999. The MWCO of the thermoplastic jacket was approximately 50 kD. The hydrogel matrix was formed by incubating the loaded fibers in a 1% calcium chloride solution for 6 minutes.</p>EXAMPLE 7: Assessment Of Viability And Function of Immobilized, Immunoisolated Islets In Vitro</p>Adult rat islets immunoisolated within double matrix vehicles by the methods described in Examples 3 and 6. Matrix liquid core vehicles with thermoplastic jackets were incubated in vitro for at least two weeks. The vehicle had a core outer diameter of 800 \u03bcm overlain with a wall thickness of 65 \u03bcm. Alginate/Alginate dual matrix vehicles had an 880 \u03bcm core diameter and 60 \u03bcm wall thickness. Incubation conditions were: immersion in Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 25% equine serum at 37\u00b0 C. in a 5%CO<sub>2</sub> -95% air atmosphere. The medium was refreshed every three to four days.</p>Using propidium iodide, the immunoisolated islet cells were found to be 95% viable after this incubation period in vitro. They were shown to remain functional as well. When tested by perfusion with glucose (Dionne, supra) immunoisolated islets were shown to have an insulin secretory response similar both in magnitude and pattern to that of unprotected islets incubated in vitro for a similar period of time and under similar conditions. Insulin release was measured by the method of Soeldner, J. S. et al. Diabetes, 14, p. 771 (1965). The results of a typical perfusion experiment are shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B. The challenge and baseline concentrations of glucose used were 300 mg % and 1",
    "to glucose and theophylline stimulation and histological analysis revealed viable islets with evidence of insulin staining within the cells. The results of the perfusion experiment with glucose and theophylline stimulation are shown in FIG. 5.</p>These favorable results contrasted sharply with those obtained when rat islets were immunoisolated within a PAN/PVC membrane without an immobilizing matrix. For these immunoisolatory vehicles, functional responsiveness lasted only 12\u00b13 days post implantation; five out of five animals tested returned to a hyperglycemic state thereafter. Histological examination of these immunoisolatory vehicles revealed agglomeration of the islets. The islets had condensed into a large mass of tissue which exhibited severe central necrosis, with only a rim of viable and identifiable islet cells surviving. Thus, the presence of a matrix to prevent islet aggregation and resulting cell death, significantly improved viability resulting in long term efficacy of the implant.</p>EXAMPLE 9: Assessment Of The Restoration Of Normoglycemia To Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetic Mice By Implantation Of Immunoisolated Concordant Xenograft Islets In Immunoglobulin Permeable Vehicles</p>In vivo performance of the double-matrix immunoisolatory vehicle was assessed using the rat-to-mouse concordant xenograft model for restoration of normoglycemia to streptozotocin induced diabetic mice. The vehicles were prepared as in Example 3 and have significant permeability to 2,000 kD Dextran (FIG. 1). Therefore, these vehicles were also readily permeable to IgG (150 kD). The results of this experiment are summarized in Table 2. The animals were divided into three groups: group 1 consisted of seven control animals into whom 300 nonimmunoisolated islets per animal were implanted at the kidney subcapsular site. Only one of these animals showed amelioration of hyperglycemia for more than 12 days. The mean duration of normoglycemia in Group 1 was 14.0\u00b13.1 days.</p>Group 2 consisted of thirteen animals each implanted with 300 rat islets immobilized in an alginate matrix lacking a surrounding cell-free region. Graft function was lost within 24 days in 8/13 of these Group 2 animals, indicating that simple immobilization conferred no advantage over the Group 1 controls. The other five animals remained normoglycemic until the graft was removed. The mean duration of normoglycemia in group 2 was 29.3\u00b15.5 days.</p>Group 3 consisted of ten animals, each implanted with 300 rat islets immobilized within a dual-matrix immunoisolatory vehicle of the configuration described in Example 3, i.e., with a surrounding layer of cell-free alginate matrix. In only four of these animals, graft function was lost within 14 days postimplantation. However, six animals remained normoglycemic beyond 100 days at which time the experiment was terminated and the grafts removed, precipitating a return to the diabetic state (FIG. 6). The mean duration of normoglycemia in group 3 was 65.8\u00b115.1 days (n=10). Fibromatous reaction to the recovered alginate vehicle was minimal. Hist",

The immunoisolated islets were found to be viable and functional, as determined by histological analysis.</p>EXAMPLE 10: Assessment Of The Survival Of Immunoisolated Islets In A Discordant Xenoaenic Recipient</p>Dual matrix immunoisolatory vehicles containing immobilized rat islets were prepared by the process of coextrusion from a nested dual-bore nozzle as described in Example 4. The conditions for the gelling of the matrix were chosen to yield a hydrogel matrix permeable to 2,000 kD blue Dextran (as in FIG. 7), thus the vehicle so formed was permeable to immunoglobulin G and to Clq.</p>Segments of about 0.5 cm in length were prepared from the continuous cylindrical vehicle by periodically interrupting the flow of the core material to form cell free regions, which were readily visible. The fiber was cut in the cell free region; thus the cells were completely surrounded by a region of cell-free alginate matrix. The vehicles were implanted between the leaves of the mesentery of guinea pigs (n=2), a discordant (i.e., distantly related) host. After 21 days of residence in vivo, the vehicles were removed and tested in vitro for glucose-responsive insulin release. These results are summarized in FIG. 8. Following basal stimulation, a statistically significant rise in insulin release from the immunoisolated islets was measured when stimulated with 300 mg/dl glucose. A return to basal insulin levels occurred when glucose returned to 100 mg/dl. Thermoplastic vehicles with alginate cores gave similar results.</p>EXAMPLE 11: Improved Tissue Viability By Controlled Reaggregation</p>Purified canine islets, prepared according to the method of Scharp and Lacy, U.S. Pat. No. 5,079,160, were dispersed into cell aggregates containing from one to 50 cells according to the following protocol. 1000 canine islets were rinsed 3 times with 50 ml of Ca++ and Mg++ free Hanks medium containing 1 mm EDTA. After the final rinse, islets were centrifuged into a pellet at 100 xg for ",
    "er two weeks, the animals were sacrificed, fixed by transcardial perfusion with cold heparinized physiologic saline and 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer. The brains were immediately dissected and postfixed overnight, followed by immersion in 15% and 25% buffered sucrose solutions. Frozen sections were cut at 25 \u03bcm from anterior to posterior on a cryostat, and all coronal sections were collected onto slides or into phosphate buffer. Representative coronal sections were processed for immunocytochemistry using a monoclonal antibody to rat ChAT (2.5 \u03bcg/ml) with the biotin-avidin-DAB method. Sections were mounted and neuronal cell bodies counterstained with cresyl violet. All ChAT-positive cell bodies were counted in the medial septum and vertical diagonal band region ipsilateral and contralateral to the lesion, between the genu of the corpus callosum and the decussation of the anterior commissure. A significant prevention of ChAT(+) cell reduction was observed in rats receiving R208N.8 capsules.</p>EXAMPLE 15: Use Of An Immunoisolatory Vehicle To Deliver A High-Molecular Weight Product To A Recipient</p>Immunoisolatory vehicles were prepared by hand loading 350,000 hybridoma cells producing an antibody (iostype immunoglobulin G), specific for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) into a 7 mm length of a medical grade, olefinic microporous hollow fiber of the kind used for plasmapheresis (Plasmaphan; Enka). The internal diameter of the fiber was 300 microns; its MWCO was about 1,000 kD. The ends of the vehicle were sealed as described in copending U.S. Ser. No. 07/461,999. The vehicle was implanted under the renal capsule of a mouse, where it was allowed to reside for 14 days. The vehicle was thereafter recovered and found to contain many cells, over 50% of which were viable as determined by the exclusion of indicator dye (pI).
