Expression of GADII\n(1) The mass-produced plasmid was introduced\ninto E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS. (2) The E. coli was cultured in LB medium\ncontaining 100 \u00b5g/ml ampicillin. When turbidity\nmeasured with a spectrophotometer (Beckman) reached 0.5\nat a wavelength of 600 nm, IPTG was added in a\nconcentration of 0.5 mM to induce the expression of\nGADII.3. Purification of GADII\n(1) Two hours later, E. coli cells were\nrecovered, and suspended in Lysis Buffer. The\nsuspension was sonicated at 4\u00b0C, and centrifuged for 15\nminutes at 18,000 rpm at 4\u00b0C with 50.2 Ti rotor using\nBeckman Optima XL-80.(2) Then, the supernatant was taken, and 1M\nimidazole (pH 7.5) was added to a final concentration\nof 10 mM. The mixture was purified with Ni-agarose\n(registered trademark, Qiagen) under non-denaturing\nconditions in accordance with its instruction manual.(3) The purified sample was subjected to 10%\nSDS-PAGE electrophoresis, and stained with Coomassie\nbrilliant blue. A band appeared around 56 kD (Fig.\n14), confirming the resulting protein to be GADII\nprotein.(4) The remaining purified GADII protein was\ntreated with 2xSDS sample buffer and subjected to 5 mm\ngel thick 10% SDS-PAGE electrophoresis in the same way\nas in (3). After electrophoresis, the gel was stained \nwith 0.25M KCl for 30 min at 4\u00b0C.(5) The white-stained target band of about 56\nkD was cut out with a cutter knife, and the band was\nfurther cut to smaller pieces with the cutter knife.(6) The pieces were subjected to Model 422\nelectroeluator (Bio-Rad) to elute the protein for 8\nhours at 20 mA in accordance with its instruction\nmanual.(7) The eluted protein was recovered in\naccordance with the instruction manual of the\nelectroeluator. The protein solution was stored at -\n80\u00b0C.</p>[Example 17] Preparation of anti-HRPI antibodies1.

The complexes were each reacted\nwith alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG\nantibodies as secondary antibodies.

That is, the\nantibodies were able to distinguish between hepatic\ncancer and normal liver, and also distinguish between a\nliver in the process of carcinogenesis and a normal\nliver. Thus, they were confirmed to be usable in the\nmonitoring of hepatic cancer outbreak and the early\ndiagnosis of hepatic cancer.</p>[Example 19] Preparation of anti-GADII antibodies1.

The\ncomplex was reacted with alkaline phosphatase-labeled\nanti-rabbit IgG antibodies as secondary antibodies.\nThe alkaline phosphatase was further reacted with a\nsubstrate (NBT, BCID (both products of Promega)) for\ncolor development. A band for GADII protein was\ndetected at 56 kD, confirming the anti-GADII antibodies\nto react with GADII protein.</p>[Example 20] Investigation of use of GADII protein in\ndiagnosing hepatic cancer(1) One gram each of the hepatic cancer tissue\n(7 month after DEN administration) and normal liver\ntissue prepared in Example 1 was homogenized in 5 ml of\n2 x SDS sample buffer, and boiled for 3 minutes to\nobtain the hepatic cancer tissue extract.(2) The extract and the GADII prepared in\nExample 16 were subjected to 12.5% SDS-PAGE\nelectrophoresis, and then Western blotted. The amounts\nof protein were unified by staining the gels,\nseparately electrophoresed similarly, with Coomassie\nbrilliant blue and comparing the colors.

As with the results of Northern\nblot hybridization, significant increases in GADII\nprotein were confirmed in hepatic cancer and in the\nprocess of hepatic cancer occurrence. That is, the\nantibodies were able to distinguish between hepatic\ncancer and normal liver, and also distinguish between a\nliver in the process of carcinogenesis and a normal\nliver.
