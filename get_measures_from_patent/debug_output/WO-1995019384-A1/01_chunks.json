    "nce of template). The stoichiometry of the materials (i.e., monomers and/or polymers) which will form the crosslinked polymer may be important to obtaining the preferred desired crosslinked polymer, as it is in the absence of template, as described above. Useful proportion ranges of the template are 5 to 500 percent by weight (of the entire reaction mass) of template, 5 to 500 percent by weight of solvent and 5 to 500 percent by weight of the materials which will form the crosslinked polymer. </p> The improved polymeric ammonium salts with enhanced bile acid binding properties which are prepared using a template, may be further processed as described above by purification, ion exchange, size reduction, and/or drying. </p>The polymeric ammonium salts of the present invention are useful as bile acid sequestrants (which lower blood plasma cholesterol levels), moisture or solvent absorbents, electroconductive agents, charge transfer agents, chelating agents and ion exchange resins . </p> Preferred compositions herein of the polymeric ammonium salts which are useful as bile acid \n\nsequestrants have a B<sub>max</sub>/K<sub>d</sub> value for cholate of greater than 0.75, more preferably 1.0 or more. B<sub>max</sub> is the maximum amount of bile acid (in this case cholate) bound per unit of crosslinked polymer of the invention, wherein Bmax is expressed in units of \u03bcmol of bile acid</p>(in this case cholate) bound per mg of dry crosslinked polymer of the invention. K<sub>d</sub> (or Kd) is the </p>concentration of free bile acid (in this case cholate) at which there is half-maximal binding of the bile acid to the crosslinked polymer of the invention. Kd is expressed in units of mM. The binding of bile acid to the crosslinked polymer of the invention may be measured using the procedures described herein below. The B<sub>max</sub> and Kd values are determined by best-fit regression fitting the binding data using either Equation 1 or Equation 2, below: </p>[Bound] = (B<sub>max</sub> \u00d7 [Free]<sup>n</sup>) / ( (Kd)<sup>n</sup> + [Free]<sup>n</sup>) </p>Equation 1 where [Bound] and [Free] are the concentration of polymer-bound and free bile acid (in this case cholate), respectively, and n is a curve fitting parameter. </p> The ligand-ligand interaction model isotherm that is used is represented by Equation 2 : </p>B = (B<sub>max</sub>/2){1 + ( (F/Kd) - 1)/Sqrt[((F/Kd) - 1)<sup>2</sup> + 4F/W \u00d7 Kd)] ) </p>Equation 2 where F is the free bile acid concentration; W is the ligand ligand interaction parameter or cooperativity parameter; and Sqrt is the square root of the quantity in brackets. (See McGhee and Von Hippel, J. Mol. Biol., \n\n 86: 469-489 (1974); Chemistry, Part III, C. Cantor and P. Schimmel (1980), pages 878-885 and pages 1242-1251.)</p>As noted above, a utility for the crosslinked polymeric ammonium salts of the present invention is as bile acid sequestrants for lowering blood plasma cholesterol in mammals. Coronary and peripheral vascular diseases are major problems in Western society and elevated blood cholesterol levels is one of the major risk factors in the development of atheroscherosis in animals as well as in humans. Several studies using lipid-lowering agents have shown the beneficial effects of lowering cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the prevention of coronary heart disease. </p> The only quantitatively significant way by which the body can eliminate cholesterol is via the bile, either by excretion of the sterol in unchanged form or after its conversion into bile acids. Cholesterol is catabolized in the liver to bile acids which are transported to the intestine through the bile ducts to facilitate the uptake of dietary lipids. </p> About 95% of bile acids secreted to the gut are reabsorbed. A small amount of bile acids are lost and excreted with feces. The losses are compensated for by new synthesis. In animals and in",
    ", was obtained from Sigma, St. Louis, MO. </p> To determine the non-specific binding, the ten stock solutions of bile salts were added to empty ultrafiltration cups and incubated together with the total binding samples. </p> To separate bound and free bile acid the ultra-filtration cups were centrifuged at 3,500 RPM at 37\u00b0C in a Du Pont RT6000 centrifuge to pass the solution of free bile acids into the outer tube. Two hundred \u03bcL of the separated binding tubes and the corresponding set of the stock solutions of total bile acid were counted for two minutes in a beta scintillation counter (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA) to detect <sup>14</sup>C DPMs in 7 mL of Formula 989 scintillation cocktail (E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, New England Nuclear, Billerica, MA). \n\n The respective specific bound DPMs were determined from the counted total added <sup>14</sup>C DPMs and derived total binding and non-specific binding DPMs. The specific bound DPMs were converted to specifically bound \u03bcmoles of bile salts at each dose level. The specific binding data was plotted on a saturation binding curve (specific bound \u03bcmoles of bile salts/mg of sequestrant versus the log of the free \u03bcmoles of bile salts/mL of solution) and the best-fit regression curve was determined using the relationship, Equation 1 below: </p>[Bound] = (B<sub>max</sub> \u00d7 [Free]<sup>n</sup>) / ( (K<sub>d</sub>)<sup>n</sup> + [Free]<sup>n</sup>) </p>Equation 1 where Bmax is the maximum amount of bile salt bound to sequestrant, Kd is the concentration of free bile salt at which there is half-maximal binding (i.e., an </p>equilibrium dissociation constant) and n is a curve fitting parameter. Another model used was the ligand-ligand interaction model isotherm that is represented by Equation 2 : </p>B = (B<sub>max</sub>/2 ) { 1 + ( (F/K<sub>d</sub>) - 1 ) / Sqrt [ ( (F/K<sub>d</sub>) - 1 ) <sup>2</sup> + 4F/W \u00d7 K<sub>d</sub>) ] ) </p>Equation 2 where F is the free bile acid concentration; W is the ligand ligand interaction parameter or cooperativity parameter; and Sqrt is the square root of the quantity in brackets. (See McGhee Von Hippel, J. Mol. Biol., 86: 469-489 (1974); Biophysical Chemistry, Part III, C. </p>Cantor and P. Schimmel (1980), pages 878-885 and pages 1242-1251.) \n\n Data for the binding of various bile acids to representative bile acid sequestrant polymers of the present invention is shown in Tables 3 and 4 below. In Tables 3 and 4, B<sub>max</sub> is presented in units of \u03bcmol of bile salt bound per mg of bile acid sequestrant and Kd is in units of mM. </p> The value B<sub>max</sub>/K<sub>d</sub> is a measure of the binding efficiency of the bile acid sequestrant for the binding of bile acids, and reflects both the total number of binding sites or binding capacity and the binding affinity of the bile acid sequestrant for bile acid. The higher this number is, the more effective a bile acid sequestrant is predicted to be. </p> As shown in Tables 3 and 4, the bile acid </p>sequestrant polymers of the present invention are substantially more effective in binding bile acids, in terms of both increased affinity and increased binding capacity, relative to cholestyramine. </p> In Table 4, the cholestyramine results were graphed using the Equation 1 and the other examples were graphed using Equation 2. </p> Substantially the same results are obtained for Bmax/Kd when the same data is analyzed using the above equation as when it is analyzed using Equation 1. </p>Table 3 </p> In Vitro Equ i librium Binding of Bi le Acids to </p> Bile Acid Sequestrant s </p>Polymer </p>of Ex .

EXAMPLES 54 TO 73 </p>Sequestrant polymers were made by a procedure similar to that used in Example 1A.

In Table 8 the results of this assay are given for the sequestrants of Examples 54 to 73. The higher the \"% Bound </p>Glycocholate\", the better the efficacy of the </p>sequestrant.

Initial Binding Assay </p> Each polymer was weighed directly into a Millipore\u00ae ultra filtration cup (10,000 NML low binding cellulose). The weight added to each cup was around 5 mg/cup with the actual weight being recorded and each polymer was weighed into 3 cups. A 10 mM glycocholic acid solution (GC) was made with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at a pH of 7, and kept at 37\u00b0C. To each cup, 2 ml of the above solution was added. This was done in sets of no more than 15 cups. Once the bile acid was added to the cups the cups were mixed with a vortex mixer and placed in a centrifuge. The cups were spun in a Sorvall\u00ae </p>RT6000 centrifuge at 3500 RPM (setting #10) at 37\u00b0C for 10 minutes. </p>B. 18 Hour Assay </p> Each polymer was weighed directly into the Millipore ultra filtration cups (10,000 NML low binding cellulose). The weight added to each cup was around 5 mg/cup with the actual weight being recorded and each polymer was weighed into 3 cups. A 10 mM glycocholic acid solution (GC) was made with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at a pH of 7. To each cup, 2 mL of the above solution was added. The cups were incubated in an orbital dry air shaker at 37\u00b0C for between 18 to 20 hours. After incubation the cups were spun in the Sorvall RT6000 centrifuge at 3500 RPMS (setting #10) at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour or until at least 200 \u03bcl of solution had been eluted. </p> The reagents were bought as a kit from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO 63178, Bile Acid Diagnostic Kit #450-A. \n\nReagents were gently",
    "BS was used as a zero control and the Absorbance from the average of 6 PBS samples was subtracted from all other samples. The 10 mM GC was diluted by a total factor of 50 to be at the maximum range of the assay, which is 200 \u03bcM, and six samples were tested. The samples were diluted by a total factor of 40. Two hundred \u03bcl of sample was needed for the assay. Since the samples were first diluted by 10 then diluted by 4, 50 \u03bcl of diluted sample plus 150 \u03bcl of PBS was assayed. For the 10 mM GC samples, they were also diluted first by 10 and then diluted by 5, therefore 40 \u03bcl of the diluted sample and 160 \u03bcl of PBS was assayed. For the bile acid zero controls, 200 \u03bcl of PBS was assayed. At this point all samples were treated the same. The assay was performed in batches of no more than 70 tubes. The samples were placed in the 37\u00b0C water bath. Using a repeat pipetter 0.5 ml of test reagent was added to each tube at a consistent pace. The timer was started at the same time that the test reagent was added to the first tube. After 5 minutes the reaction was stopped by adding 100 \u03bcl of 1.33 M phosphoric acid at the same pace that the test reagent was added. The samples were poured into \n\n1.5 ml plastic cuvets and read on a spectrometer at 530 nm. Samples were only stable for one hour. </p> Using absorbance data obtained from standard GC solutions, the percent of bile acid bound per 5 mg of sequestrant was calculated. Cholestyramine was tested in every assay for comparative purposes. The binding assay for a polymer was repeated if the three samples were not within the standard error of about 5% to 10% compared to each other. \n\n</p>TABLE 8 </p> % BOUND GLYCOCHOLATE OF VARIOUS SEQUESTRANTS Polymer of Ex.
