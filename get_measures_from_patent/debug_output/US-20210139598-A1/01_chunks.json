    "nnected by disulfide bonds, or an antigen binding fragment thereof. Each heavy chain is comprised of a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as V<sub>H</sub>) and a heavy chain constant region. In certain naturally occurring IgG, IgD and IgA antibodies, the heavy chain constant region is comprised of three domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3. In certain naturally occurring antibodies, each light chain is comprised of a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as V<sub>L</sub>) and a light chain constant region. The light chain constant region is comprised of one domain, C<sub>L</sub>. The V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions (CDR), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>is composed of three CDRs and four framework regions (FRs), arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. The variable regions of the heavy and light chains contain a binding domain that interacts with an antigen. The constant regions of the antibodies may mediate the binding of the immunoglobulin to host tissues or factors, including various cells of the immune system (e.g., effector cells) and the first component (Clq) of the classical complement system.</p>Antibodies typically bind specifically to their cognate antigen with high affinity, reflected by a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>to 10<sup>\u221211 </sup>M or less. Any K<sub>D </sub>greater than about 10<sup>\u22126 </sup>M is generally considered to indicate nonspecific binding. As used herein, an antibody that \u201cbinds specifically\u201d to an antigen refers to an antibody that binds to the antigen and substantially identical antigens with high affinity, which means having a K<sub>D </sub>of 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>M or less, preferably 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M or less, even more preferably 5\u00d710<sup>\u22129 </sup>M or less, and most preferably between 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M and 10<sup>\u221210 </sup>M or less, but does not bind with high affinity to unrelated antigens. An antigen is \u201csubstantially identical\u201d to a given antigen if it exhibits a high degree of sequence identity to the given antigen, for example, if it exhibits at least 80%, at least 90%, preferably at least 95%, more preferably at least 97%, or even more preferably at least 99% sequence identity to the sequence of the given antigen. By way of example, an antibody that binds specifically to human CD40 might also cross-react with CD40 from certain non-human primate species (e.g., cynomolgus monkey), but might not cross-react with CD40 from other species, or with an antigen other than CD40.</p>Unless otherwise indicated, an immunoglobulin may be from any of the commonly known isotypes, including but not limited to IgA, secretory IgA, IgG and IgM. The IgG isotype is divided in subclasses in certain species: IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and ",

Protoc.; 2006; doi:10.1101/pdb.prot4277 or in Chapter 11 of \u201cUsing Antibodies\u201d by Ed Harlow and David Lane, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., USA 1999. Competing antibodies bind to the same epitope, an overlapping epitope or to adjacent epitopes (e.g., as evidenced by steric hindrance).</p>Other competitive binding assays include: solid phase direct or indirect radioimmunoassay (RIA), solid phase direct or indirect enzyme immunoassay (EIA), sandwich competition assay (see Stahli et al. (1983) Methods in Enzymology 9:242); solid phase direct biotin-avidin EIA (see Kirkland et al. (1986) J. Immunol. 137:3614); solid phase direct labeled assay, solid phase direct labeled sandwich assay (see Harlow and Lane (1988), Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Press); solid phase direct label RIA using I-125 label (see Morel et al. (1988) Mol. Immunol. 25(1):7); solid phase direct biotin-avidin EIA (Cheung et al. (1990) Virology 176:546); and direct labeled RIA. (Moldenhauer et al. (1990) Scand. J. Immunol. 32:77).</p>As used herein, the terms \u201cspecific binding,\u201d \u201cselective binding,\u201d \u201cselectively binds,\u201d and \u201cspecifically binds,\u201d refer to antibody binding to an epitope on a predetermined antigen but not to other antigens. Typically, the antibody (i) binds with an equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of approximately less than 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, such as approximately less than 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>M or 10<sup>\u221210 </sup>M or even lower when determined by, e.g., surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology in a BIACORE 2000 surface plasmon resonance instrument using the predetermined antigen, e.g., recombinant human CD40, as the analyte and the antibody as the ligand, or Scatchard analysis of binding of the antibody to antigen positive cells, and (ii) binds to the predetermined antigen with an affinity that is at least two-fold greater than its affinity for binding to a non-specific antigen (e.g., BSA, casein) other than the predetermined antigen or a closely-related antigen. Accordingly, an antibody that \u201cspecifically binds to human CD40\u201d refers to an antibody that binds to soluble or cell bound human CD40 with a K<sub>D </sub>of 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>M or less, such as approximately less than 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>M or 10<sup>\u221210 </sup>M or even lower. An antibody that \u201ccross-reacts with cynomolgus CD40\u201d refers to an antibody that binds to cynomolgus CD40 with a K<sub>D </sub>of 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>M or less, such as approximately less than 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>M or 10<sup>\u221210 </sup>M or even lower.</p>The term \u201ck<sub>assoc</sub>\u201d or \u201cK<sub>A</sub>\u201d, as used herein, refers to the association rate constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction, whereas the term \u201ck<sub>dis</sub>\u201d or \u201cK<sub>D</sub>,\u201d as used herein, refers to the dissociation rate constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction. The term \u201cK<sub>D</sub>\u201d, as used herein, refers to the equilibrium dissociation constant, which is obtained from the ratio of K<sub>D </sub>to K<sub>A </sub>(i.e., K<sub>D</sub>/K<sub>A</sub>) and is expressed as a molar concentration (M). K<sub>D </sub>values for antibodies can be determined using methods well established in the art. A preferred method for determining the K<sub>D </sub>of an antibody is biolayer interferometry (BLI) analysis, preferably using a ForteBio Octet RED device, surface plasmon resonance, preferably using a biosensor system such as a BIACORE surface plasmon resonance system (see Example 5), or flow cytometry and Scatchard analysis.</p>The term \u201cEC50\u201d in the context of an in vitro or in vivo assay using an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof, refers to the concentration of an antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof that induces a response that is 50% of the maximal response, i.e., halfway between the maximal response and the baseline.</p>The term \u201cbinds to immobilized CD40\u201d refers to the ability of an antibody described herein to bind to CD40, for example, expressed on the surface of a cell or attached to a solid support.</p>The term \u201ccross-reacts,\u201d as used herein, refers to the ability of an antibody described herein to bind to CD40 from a different species. For example, an antibody described herein that binds human CD40 may also bind CD40 from another species (e.g., cynomolgus CD40). As used herein, cross-reactivity may be measured by detecting a specific reactivity with purified antigen in binding assays (e.g., SPR, ELISA) or binding to, or otherwise functionally interacting with, cells physiologically expressing CD40. Methods for determining cross-reactivity include standard binding assays as described herein, for example, by BIACORE surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis using a BIACORE 2000 SPR instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden), or flow cytometric techniques.</p>The term \u201cnaturally-occurring\u201d as used herein as applied to an object refers to the fact that an object can be found in nature.

    "umor inoculation, mice were randomized by tumor size (day 0) and received intraperitoneal (i p) injection of 200 g anti-CD40 or control IgGs. Mice received an additional 200 \u03bcg of IgG treatment at days 3. For the B16 lung metastasis model, mice were injected intravenously with 1\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>B16-F10 cells and treated with 40 \u03bcg of the indicated Abs on days 1 and 4 after tumor cell injection. On day 14 lungs were harvested and analyzed for the presence of surface metastasis foci by using a dissecting microscope.</p>Example 10Generation of Human Anti-CD40-Fc-Variant Clinical CandidatesTo test whether the in vivo activity of human IgGs targeting human CD40 requires interaction with huFc\u03b3RIIB and determine if such interactions can be further engineered to optimize the activity of the parent antibody, the variable regions of anti-CD40 clone 2141 (CP-870,893, originally an IgG2 isotype) were cloned into Fc-modified Abs with differential capacity to engage human Fc\u03b3Rs. These include wild type human IgG1 and a series of mutated IgG1s with increased binding affinities to hu Fc\u03b3RIIB. ELISA FIG. 1D and SPR (Table 3) confirmed that the different Fc domains introduced into 2141 Abs did not alter either their binding specificity or their affinity to human CD40.
