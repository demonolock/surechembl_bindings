    "ed within a RCCS bioreactor. Rates of rotation to maintain this type of construct in suspension within the RCCS bioreactor range from 4-20 rpm, depending upon the mass of the tissue and the specific materials used to fabricate the outer cylinder. Variations of this design include the addition of angiogenic factors in the matrix, gene sequences, and agents to suppress inflammation and/or rejection. Other cell types may be added to the construct, for example microvascular endothelial cells, to accelerate the formation of a capillary system within the construct. Other variations in this design principle can be used. For example, cells may be electroprocessed into the matrix as it is deposited on the ground target. By varying the pitch of the fibers during spinning and spraying, dribbling or electroprocessing cells onto the fibers as they are deposited very precisely controls the positioning of the cells within the construct. </p>EXAMPLE 8 [0301] Electrospinning of Type I Collagen </p>[0302] Type I collagen was used (calf skin, Sigma Chemical Co.). The collagen was suspended in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-isopropanol (HFIP) at a concentration of 0.1181 grams in 3 ml HFIP. Once in solution or suspension (solution a milky color), the solution was loaded into a 1 ml syringe plunger. A 15-gauge luer stub adapter was then placed on the syringe to act as the electrospinning nozzle and charging point for the contained collagen solution. The filled syringe was placed in the a syringe pump (KD Scientific) set to dispense the solution at 18 ml/hr utilizing a 1.0-ml syringe plunger (Becton Dickinson). The positive lead from the high voltage supply was attached to the luer stub adapter metal portion. The syringe pump was turned on. The high voltage supply turned on and set at 20 kV. The grounded target was a 303 stainless steel mandrel (0.6 cm width (W)\u00d70.05 cm height (H)\u00d74 cm length (L)) placed approximately 6 inches from the tip of the adapter. The mandrel was rotated at approximately 500 rpm during the spinning process. About 1 ml of the collagen solution was electrospun to form a white mat on the grounded mandrel. After electrospinning, the collagen mat was removed from the mandrel and processed for scanning electron microscopy. The mat produced was approximately 200 microns thick. </p>[0303] Transmission electron revealed an approximate 100 nm collagen fiber diameter and the typical 67 nm banding indicative of native collagen polymerization (FIG. 9). </p>EXAMPLE 9 [0304] Electrospinning of Collagen and Elastin </p>[0305] The methods for this example are the same as in Example 8 except for the electrospun solution. In this case, the spinning solution consisted of 0.1155 grams collagen, 0.1234 grams of elastin from ligamentum nuchae (Fluka), and 5 ml HFIP. About 2 ml of the suspension was spun to form the mat. The mat produced was approximately 50 microns thick. </p>EXAMPLE 10 [0306] Electrospinning of Type I Collagen, Type III Collagen and Elastin </p>[0307] The methods for this example are the same as Example 8 except for the electrospun solution. In this example, the solution electrospun was composed of 0.067 grams of type I collagen, 0.067 grams of type III collagen, 0.017 grams of elastin from ligamentum nuchae, and 2 ml HFIP (44% Type I, 44% Type III, and 12% elastin). This ratio is similar to that found in native arterial wall tissue. The mats produced were approximately 100 microns thick. </p>EXAMPLE 11 [0308] Electrospinning of Collagen (Types I and III), Crosslinking, Structural Analysis and Strength Testing </p>[0309] Acid soluble, lyophilized collagen was used for all experimentation. Unless otherwise noted all reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis, Mich.). For this study, Type I collagen from calfskin, and Type I and Type III collagen isolated from human placenta were used. Collagen was dissolved at various concentrations in 1,1,1,3,3,3 hexaflouro-2-propanol (HFIP). Suspensions of collagen were placed into a 1.0 ml syringe mounted in a syringe pump (Model 100, KD Scientific Inc., New Hope, Pa.). The syringe was capped with an 18-gauge blunt end needle. The positive lead from a high voltage supply (Spellman CZE1000R; Spellman High Voltage Electronics Corp.) was attached via an alligator clip to the external surface of the metal syringe needle. A cylindrical (0.6 cm W\u00d70.05 cm H\u00d74 cm L) grounded target fabricated from 303 stainless steel was mounted 4-6 inches from the tip of the syringe tip. At the onset of electrospinning, the syringe pump was set to deliver the source solution at rates varying from 0-25 ml/hr. Simultaneously, the high voltage was applied across the source solution and the grounded target mandrel (15-30 kilovolts (kV)). The mandrel rotated at approximately 500 rpm unless otherwise noted. In summary, during the electrospinning process the isotype and concentration of collagen, imposed voltages, the air gap distance, and flow rates were examined. Type I collagen from calfskin was electrospun onto a 4 mm diameter cylindrical culture platform (length=1 cm). Constructs were cross-linked in glutaraldehyde vapor for 24 hours at room temperature and then rinsed through several changes of phosphate buffered saline. </p>EXAMPLE 12 [0310] Testing of Various Conditions for Electrospinning Collagen </p>[0311] Preliminary experimentation identified HFIP as a preferred solvent for electrospinning collagen. HFIP is an organic, volatile solvent with a boiling point of 61\u00b0 C. The electrospinning of collagen fibers exhibited a concent",
    " the immediate vicinity of the sutures used to enclose the constructs and subsequently anchor the implants to the tendonous attachments of the vastus lateralis. The mechanical forces placed across these domains may be very complex, resulting in differentiation but poor myotube alignment. At the ultrastructural level the engineered tissue exhibited parallel arrays of myofibrils interspersed with mitochondria. Sarcoplasmic reticulum invested these filaments and terminated in association with T tubules at the level of the Z bands. A small percentage of myotubes exhibited evidence of structural anomalies; sarcomeres with accessory banding patterns were evident. Electron dense bands were occasionally observed on either side of the Z-bands, near the A I border. Doublet M and H bands were also observed in some myotubes. This pattern of organization is observed in the muscle of the neonatal rat prior to full maturation of the muscle. </p>EXAMPLE 23 [0360] Electrospinning of Collagen from 2,2,2-Trifluoroethanol </p>[0361] The collagen used was Type I (rat tail, acid extracted). The collagen was suspended in 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) at a concentration of 0.100 grams in 4 ml HFIP. Once in solution or suspension (solution a milky color), the solution was loaded into a 10 ml syringe plunger. A 18-gauge stub needle was then placed on the syringe to act as the electrospinning nozzle and charging point for the contained collagen solution. The filled syringe was placed in a syringe pump (KD Scientific) set to dispense the solution at rate of 11 ml/hr utilizing a Becton Dickinson 10-ml syringe plunger. The positive lead from the high voltage supply was attached to the stub adapter metal portion. The syringe pump was turned on and the high voltage supply turned on and set at 20 kV. The grounded target was a 303 stainless steel mandrel (0.6 cm W\u00d70.05 cm H\u00d74 cm L) placed approximately 6 inches from the tip of the adapter. In the experiment, the collagen solution was electrospun to form a nice, white mat on the grounded mandrel. After electrospinning, the collagen mat was removed from the mandrel and processed for scanning electron microscopy evaluation. The mat produced was approximately 100 microns thick. The average fiber size in this mat was 0.11\u00b10.06 microns. The TFE does not modify the secondary structure of collagen, as shown by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. </p>EXAMPLE 24 [0362] Smooth Muscle Cell Migration in Electrospun Poly(lactic acid) and Collagen/Elastin </p>[0363] A scaffold for small diameter vascular graft development was constructed using electrospun collagen/elastin nanofibers and smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration into this scaffold was examined relative to an electrospun poly(lactic acid) scaffold. Four millimeter diameter tubes were electrospun from poly(lactic acid) (PLA) (Alkermes, Inc.) and 80:20 collagen (type I)/elastin, respectively, with a wall thickness in the range of 300-400 microns and a length of 1 cm. Samples were elec",
    "ndrel, removed and fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde gas. The tube was tied closed at both ends with catgut suture; its outer surface was seeded with fibroblasts, and placed in a rotary cell culture system. After 4 days in culture the tube was removed, untied at one end, and a solution of suspended smooth muscle cells was injected into the tube lumen. The reopened end was then tied with suture and the tube was placed in culture for 4 days. While the first tube remained in culture, a second tube consisting of 70% elastin and 30% type I was electrospun onto a mandrel with a 2 mm I.D. After fixation the 2 mm I.D. tube was slid into the 4 mm I.D. tube and two were placed in rotary cell culture for 3 days. This was done to ensure SMC migration into the smaller tube since endothelial cell alignment is promoted in the presence of SMCs. After 3 days in culture, human umbilical vein endothelial cells were injected into the inside of the 2 mm I.D. tube and cultured for 2 more days. </p>[0409] The resultant vascular prosthetic was then removed and fixed for histology. Histological analysis revealed a three-layered prosthetic wall demonstrating defined intimal, medial, and adventitial layers. </p>EXAMPLE 32 [0410] Mechanical Behavior and Cellular Proliferation </p>[0411] Methods: Scaffold Preparation: Collagen Type II from chicken sternae (SIGMA, St. Louis Mo.) was dissolved in HFIP (SIGMA). A 5 ml syringe was filled with the collagen II/HFIP solution and placed onto a syringe pump (Model 100, KD Scientific Inc., New Hope, Pa.). The syringe tip was connected to a 30 kV voltage supply (Spellman CZE1000R; Spellman High Voltage Electronics Corp., Hauppauge, N.Y.) in order to charge the solution. A square (38 mm L\u00d75 mm W\u00d738 mm H) rotating, aluminum mandrel was placed perpendicular to the syringe tip. The solution was discharged from the syringe at a constant rate and fibers collected on the mandrel. After removal from the mandrel, the created scaffold was sectioned into dogbone scaffold specimens (long axis parallel to preferred fiber direction) and either mechanically tested or crosslinked for cell seeding and cell culturing. Crosslinking was achieved with a 24 hour, 3% vapor glutaraldehyde fixation technique. The seeding scaffold specimens were disinfected with a 5 minute ethyl alcohol wash followed by a 5 minute phosphate buffered saline wash. These disinfected scaffolds were then placed in 10 ml of culture media for at least 4 hours prior to seeding. </p>[0412] Cell Source: Immortalized adult human articular chondrocytes were cultured in DMEM/F-12 (GIBCO) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin plus streptomycin. The cells were passaged every four to five days and used for cell seeding. </p>[0413] Scaffold Cell Seeding: Disinfected scaffolds were placed into a rotating seeding chamber along with approximately 5\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>to 10\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>cells and culture media supplemented with 50 \u03bcg/ml of ascorbic acid. The scaffolds were rotated for two hour"
