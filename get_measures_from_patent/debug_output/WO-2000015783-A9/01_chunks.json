    "and the hypotensive effect continued for 8 days.</p>The next step was repeated injection. Two weeks after the first treatment, a second injection was given. Repeated injections showed that the blood pressure was again reduced with a second dose to the same extent. Thus, there was no loss of efficacy, and no evidence of tachyphylaxis. Further, no toxicity was noted. \n\n Then 2K-1C rats were tested. Eight to ten days after the clipping of one renal artery in healthy Sprague-Dawley rats, blood pressure rose to the plateau by 40-50 mmHg and hypertension was readily established. 200 \u03bcg of an AS-ON having the nucleotide sequence according to SEQ ID NO:l as given intravenously. It reduced blood pressure by 15-20 mmHg for 4 days. Again, inverted ON produced no effect.</p>These data show that an oligonucleotide comprising the nucleotide sequence according to SEQ ID NO:l, SEQ ID NO:2, or SEQ ID NO:3 was an effective antihypertensive agent. A single injection was effective for 8 days, and a repeated injection prolongs the antihypertensive effect. Heart rate was not affected. The ODN treatment was tolerated very well, and there were no apparent side effects.</p>5.1.2 INHIBITION OF EXPRESSION OF \u03b2<sub>r</sub>ADREN\u03b8CEPT\u03b8RS \u03b2,-AS-ONs were tested in Sprague-Dawley rats for their ability to inhibit the expression of \u03b2,-adrenoceptors in the heart. Two days after intravenous injection of 200 \u03bcg of ODM, the rats were sacrificed and the \u03b2-adrenoceptors on the ventricular membrane were measured by binding assay disclosed in Baker and Pitha, 1982. The data as shown below in Table 4 demonstrated that each of the oligonucleotides was effective in inhibiting \u03b2-adrenoceptor expression. Because \u03b2, subtype comprises 80-90% of \u03b2-adrenoceptors in the heart and the AS-ONs used in this study were designed against \u03b2, subtype specifically, the significant decrease (30-40%) in \u03b2-adrenoceptor was due to the inhibition of \u03b2, expression.</p>TABLE 4</p>K<sub>D</sub> (pM) B<sub>ma</sub> (fmol/mg) Change in %</p>Control, no treatment 55 42.1</p>Control, inverted ON 56 39.7 -5.7%</p>AS-ON (SEQ ID NO: 1) 34 27.5 -34.6%</p>AS-ON (SEQ ID NO:2) 32 26.0 -38.2%</p>AS-ON (SEQ ID NO:3) 36 28.9 -31.4% \n\n Next, an isolated perfused heart model was employed to test the ability of \u03b2j -AS-ON to reduce the contractile force of rat heart in response to \u03b2-stimulation. Two days after intravenous injection of AS-ON, the hearts were perfused according to Langendorff and contractility was measured upon different doses of isoproterenol. All ONs shifted the dose response curve downward. Maximum contractile force was decreased by 30-50%.</p>These data demonstrate that the B_R antisense-ONs of the subject invention are beneficial as an antihypertensive agent. The AS-ON of the present invention can be used in the same way as current beta-blockers have been used, but have the advantage of being longer-lasting, and therefore taken less frequently, and are better for patient compliance.</p>EXAMPLE 2 - ANTISENSE INHIB",
    "1998). ODN/liposome complex was prepared on the day of use by mixing desired amounts of ODNs with DOTAP/DOPE to the final DNA concentration of 300 \u03bcg/ml in 5% (wt./vol.) dextrose in water and incubating at room temperature for 60 min. Two DNA lipid mole ratios, i.e., 1:0.5 and 1 :2.5, were used in each study.</p>5.2.1.3 ANIMAL SURGERY</p>Adult male SHRs (250-350 g, Harlan) were kept in cages in a room with a 12-hr light-dark cycle. Animals were fed standard laboratory rat chow and tap water ad libitum.</p>5.2.1.4 TELEMETRIC SENSOR IMPLANTATION</p>Before implantation, the zero of each radiotransmitter (TA11PA-C40, Data</p>Sciences) was verified to be &lt; 4 mm Hg. SHR were anesthetized with 100 mg/kg ketamine and 15 mg/kg xylazine and a midline abdominal incision was made. A fluid-filled catheter was then inserted into the right femoral artery and the tip of the catheter was in the abdominal aorta caudal to the renal arteries. The implanted rats were allowed to recover for one week.</p>5.2.1.5 JUGULAR VEIN CANNULATION</p>One week after telemetric implantation, rats were anesthetized and a curved catheter made of PE 50 and vinyl tubing was inserted into the external branch of the jugular vein. The tubing was led under the skin of the neck and exposed on the back to allow for drug infusion. Rats were allowed to recover for 24 hr before experimentation. The catheters were flushed with 100 U heparin every day to prevent clogging.</p>5.2.1.6 MEMBRANE PREPARATION AND \u03b2-ADRENOCEPTOR BINDING ASSAY</p>Four days after intravenous injection of saline (n=6) or 1 mg/kg inverted ODN</p>(n=6), or 2, 4, 10, 18 days after injection of 1 mg/kg \u03b2,-AS-ODN (n=24), animals were sacrificed and membranes were prepared from heart ventricles as previously described (Baker and Pitha, 1982). For saturation studies, 100 \u03bcg membrane protein was incubated in triplicate with six concentrations of <sup>125</sup>I-(-)iodocyanopindolol (I-CYP, NEN Life Science, 6.25-100 pM) in a total volume of 250 \u03bcl containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM \n\nMgCl<sub>2</sub> at 36\u00b0C for 60 min. The nonspecific and \u03b2<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor binding levels were determined in the presence of 1 \u03bcM (\u00b1)-alprenolol and 150 nM CGP20712A (RBI), respectively. Then the reaction mixture was passed through Whatman GF/B glass fiber filter using Brandel harvester and the bound radioactivity was counted for one min.</p>5.2.1.7 TISSUE PREPARATION AND QUANTITATIVE AUTORADIOGRAPHY</p>Four days after injection of 1 mg/kg \u03b2,-AS-ODN (n=6) or saline (n=6), rats were sacrificed and tissues were removed and frozen in dry ice. Coronal sections of brain, horizontal sections of heart and sagittal sections of kidney (20 \u03bcm) were cut on a cryostat (Microm) at -20\u00b0C and mounted on microscope slides. Every seventh slide was stained with haematoxylin and eosin for histology. Tissue sections were preincubated in Krebs buffer (NaCl 118.4 mM, KCI 4.7 mM, MgSO<sub>4</sub> 1.2 mM, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1.27 mM, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</s",

The heart was placed in a semi-closed circulating water- warmed (37\u00b0C) air chamber, paced atrially with a Medtronic 5320 pacemaker at a rate of 300 bpm, and perfused at a constant flow (5.5-6.0 ml/per min). Coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) was measured via a catheter placed just proximal to the aorta and connected to a Gould Statham P23ID pressure transducer. A latex balloon filled with water and connected to a Gould Statham P23ID pressure transducer was inserted in the left ventricle through the \n\n -oZ- left atrium to measure left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), and developed left ventricular pressure (dLVP) (dLVP = LVSP - LVEDP). LVEDP during equilibration was set at 5 to 7 mmHg. All measurements were continuously recorded on a 4-channel record (Astro-Med).</p>5.3.1.4 MYOCARDIAL ISCHEMIA AND REPERFUSION</p>Six hearts from saline-treated rats were continuously perfused with Kreb-Henseleit buffer for 80 min and served as sham control. Hearts from other rats, after 20 min of equilibration, were subjected to 30 min of ischemia followed by 30 min of reperfusion. After completion of the study, hearts were frozen in liquid-nitrogen for \u03b2 AR analysis by binding assay, \u03b2<sub>r</sub>AR protein analyses by Western blot, \u03b2,-AR mRNA analysis by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and measurement of MDA.</p>5.3.1.5 DETERMINATION OF \u03b2j-AR DENSITY IN MYOCARDIUM</p>Membrane protein was prepared from left ventricles as previously described (Baker and Pitha, 1982). For saturation studies, 100 \u03bcg membrane protein was incubated in triplicate with <sup>125</sup>I-(-)iodocyanopindolol (I-CYP, NEN Life Science, 6.25-100 pM) in a total volume of 250 \u03bcl containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> at 36\u00b0C for 60 min.

Then the reaction mixture was passed through Whatman GF/B glass filter using Brandel harvester and the radioactivity was counted for one min.</p>5.3.1.6 QUANTIFICATION OF \u03b2<sub>j</sub>-AR PROTEIN EXPRESSION IN MYOCARDIUM</p>Myocardial tissues were homogenized and lysed in boiling lysis buffer (1% SDS,</p>0.1% Triton X-100\u00ae, and 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C. The lysate protein from myocardial tissues (20 \u03bcg/lane) was separated by 8% SDS-PAGE using a Bio-Rad Mini-Protean cell, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham). After incubation in blocking solution (4% non-fat milk, Sigma), membranes were incubated with 1:1000 dilation primary antibody (polycolonal antibody to \u03b2,-AR, Santa Cruz Bio"
