When each cysteine residue has 1 or 2 amino acid residues on the N-terminal side and C-terminal side, the remaining amino acids 1 to 2 and 16 to 17 from the N terminal when 17 amino acid residues are used The groups are those exemplified above.\n</p>\nAs described above, in the peptide of the present invention, Xaa1 is a protein-constituting amino acid such as lysine residue, cysteine residue, aspartic acid residue, and glutamic acid residue, and non-protein such as diaminopropionic acid and 2-aminosuberic acid It is a constituent amino acid, preferably a lysine residue. Xaa1 is preferably modifiable by a crosslinking agent described later. As used herein, \u201cnon-proteinogenic amino acid\u201d refers to an amino acid that is not used to constitute a protein in a living body. In order to enhance the site specificity when the peptide of the present invention is modified with a cross-linking agent, the peptide of the present invention has no or almost no residue in the sequence as Xaa1 (for example, 1 Preferably only one or two). For example, when Xaa1 is a lysine residue, the peptide of the present invention preferably has no or almost no lysine residue in the sequence other than Xaa1.\n</p>The peptide of the present invention has a binding affinity for human IgG of about 10 times or more, preferably about 50 times or more, more preferably about 200 times or more compared to other human immunoglobulins (IgA, IgE, IgM). high. The dissociation constant (Kd) relating to the binding between the peptide of the present invention and human IgG can be determined by surface plasmon resonance spectrum analysis (for example, using the BIACORE system), for example, 1 \u00d7 10 <sup>\u22121</sup> M to less than 1 \u00d7 10 <sup>\u22123</sup> M , Preferably less than 1 \u00d7 10 <sup>\u22124</sup> M, more preferably less than 1 \u00d7 10 <sup>\u22125</sup> M.</p>\nThe IgG-binding peptide of the present invention binds to the Fc domain of IgG. As shown in the examples described later, the IgG-binding peptide of the present invention has a specific region of IgG Fc, that is, Lys248 residue according to Eu numbering in human IgG Fc (hereinafter, simply referred to as \u201cLys248\u201d in the present specification). (Also referred to as the 18th residue of human IgG CH2 (SEQ ID NO: 30)) or Lys246 residue (hereinafter, also simply referred to as \u201cLys246\u201d in this specification, and human IgG CH2 (SEQ ID NO: 30)). Corresponding to the 16th residue), preferably close to Lys248.\n</p>\nPeptides of the present invention include conventional liquid phase synthesis methods, peptide synthesis methods such as solid phase synthesis methods, peptide synthesis using an automatic peptide synthesizer, etc. (Kelley et al., Genetics Engineering Principles and Methods, Setlow, JK eds., Plenum Press NY.

    "ethod after hydrolysis of NHS group by adding 1/10 volume of 1M Tris-HCl (pH = 7.0) and reacting for 15 minutes. 0.4MCMEDC (1-ethyl-3- (3-dimethylaminopropyl) -carbodiimide, 1-ethyl-3- (3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide) and 0.1M onto CM5 sensor chip set in BIAcoreT200 (GE healthcare) After mixing an equal volume of sulfo-NHS (sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide), the sensor chip is activated by injecting into the sensor chip for 7 minutes at a flow rate of 10 \u03bcl / ml, pH 4.0 IgG was immobilized so that the amount of immobilization was 4000 to 5000 in terms of RU value under the condition of (10 mM mM acetic acid Na). Inject peptide at a concentration of 10 nM to 2 \u03bcM for 180 \u03bcs at a flow rate of 50 \u03bcl / ml using HBS-EP buffer (0.01 M HEPES, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.005% Tween 20, 3 mM mM EDTA, pH 7.0) Thus, the binding reaction was monitored, and then the dissociation reaction was measured by washing with a buffer solution for 600 \u03bcsec. Analysis of binding parameters was performed using BIAevalution\u00ae T100 software.\n</p>&lt;Result&gt;  In order to examine whether the introduction of the cross-linked structure affects the specificity and affinity of the IgG-binding peptide, the binding force to the IgG of the IgG-binding peptide into which the cross-linked structure was introduced was measured by SPR analysis (Table 1). The affinity of human IgG for an IgG binding peptide (hereinafter also referred to as Type I (R8K)) in which the arginine at the 8th residue is replaced with lysine is 131 nM (Kd). The affinity was reduced 10 times compared to that of (I). When each cross-linking agent is bound to Type I (R8K) peptide, the affinity for human IgG is about 330 nM (Kd) and Type I (R8K) -DSS-OH for Type I (R8K) -DSG-OH. About 390 nM (Kd), and no significant decrease in affinity due to binding of the cross-linking agent was observed. Any peptide has an affinity of \u03bcM or less in Kd value, and thus it was considered that sufficiently specific labeling was possible.</p><img id=\"\" path=\"JPOXMLDOC01-appb-T000011.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/362240925/WO/20161124/A1/002016/18/62/06/JPOXMLDOC01-appb-T000011.tif\"/></p>[Example 3: Specific modification of human IgG-Fc with IgG-binding peptide]  &lt;Method&gt;  A labeled reagent peptide in which an IgG-binding peptide (Type I (R8K)) with Biotin-PEG4 added to the N-terminus was modified with DSS or DSG by the same method as in Example 2, was reacted with human IgG Fc, The labeling reaction of human IgG Fc was examined.
