    " and would meet a high unmet medical need. Indeed, there is currently no therapeutic option to improve and/ or accelerate recovery from hip fracture surgery. This objective is achieved by the methods and dosing regimen provided within this disclosure. </p>A first subject matter of the disclosure therefore relates to methods or uses for improving and/or accelerating recovery from hip fracture surgery of compositions comprising a myostatin antagonist, which can be a myostatin binding molecule or an ActRII binding molecule. The myostatin binding molecule can be, e.g., an antagonist antibody to \n\n myostatin. The ActRM binding molecule can be, e.g., an antagonist antibody to ActRM, e.g., bimagrumab also known as BYM338. </p> \"Myostatin antagonist\" as used herein refers to a molecule capable of antagonizing (e.g., reducing, inhibiting, decreasing, delaying) myostatin function, expression and/or signalling (e.g., by blocking the binding of myostatin to the myostatin receptor, i.e., ActRM). Non-limiting examples of antagonists include myostatin binding molecules and ActRM receptor binding molecules. In some embodiments of the disclosed methods, regimens, kits, processes, uses and compositions, a myostatin antagonist is employed. </p> By \"myostatin binding molecule\" is meant any molecule capable of binding to the human myostatin antigen either alone or associated with other molecules. The binding reaction may be shown by standard methods (qualitative assays) including, for example, a binding assay, competition assay or a bioassay for determining the inhibition of myostatin binding to its receptor or any kind of binding assays, with reference to a negative control test in which an antibody of unrelated specificity, but ideally of the same isotype, e.g., an anti-CD25 antibody, is used. Non-limiting examples of myostatin binding molecules include small molecules, myostatin receptor decoys, and antibodies that bind to myostatin as produced by B-cells or hybridomas and chimeric, CDR-grafted or human antibodies or any fragment thereof, e.g., F(ab')<sub>2</sub> and Fab fragments, as well as single chain or single domain antibodies. Preferably the myostatin binding molecule antagonizes (e.g., reduces, inhibits, decreases, delays) myostatin function, expression and/or signalling. In some embodiments of the disclosed methods, regimens, kits, processes, uses and compositions, a myostatin binding molecule is employed. </p> By \"ActRM binding molecule\" is meant any molecule capable of binding to the human ActRM receptor (ActRIIA and/or ActRIIB) either alone or associated with other molecules. The binding reaction may be shown by standard methods (qualitative assays) including, for example, a binding assay, competition assay or a bioassay for determining the inhibition of ActRM receptor binding to myostatin or any kind of binding assays, with reference to a negative control test in which an antibody of unrelated specificity, but ideally of the same isotype, e.g., an anti-CD25 antibody, is used. Non-limiting examples of ActRM receptor binding molecules include small molecules, myostatin decoys, and antibodies to the ActRM receptor as produced by B-cells or hybridomas and chimeric, CDR-grafted or human antibodies or any fragment thereof, e.g., F(ab')<sub>2</sub> and Fab fragments, as well as single chain or single domain antibodies. Preferably the ActRM receptor binding molecule antagonizes (e.g., reduces, inhibits, decreases, delays) myostatin function, expression and/or signalling. In some embodiments of the disclosed methods, regimens, kits, processes, uses and compositions, an ActRIIB receptor binding molecule is employed. \n\n In another embodiment the composition comprises an anti-ActRII antibody which binds to a binding domain consisting of amino acids 19-134 of SEQ ID NO: 181 (SEQ ID NO:182), or to an epitope comprising or consisting of (a) amino acids 78-83 of SEQ ID NO: 181 (WLDDFN - SEQ ID NO:188); (b) amino acids 76-84 of SEQ ID NO:181 (GCWLDDFNC - SEQ ID NO:186); (c) amino acids 75-85 of SEQ ID NO:181 (KGCWLDDFNCY - SEQ ID NO:190); (d) amino acids 52-56 of SEQ ID NO:181 (EQDKR - SEQ ID NO:189); (e) amino acids 49-63 of SEQ ID NO:181 (CEGEQDKRLHCYASW - SEQ",
    "mbinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the V<sub>L</sub> and V<sub>H</sub> regions pair to \n\n form monovalent molecules (known as single chain Fv (scFv); see e.g. Bird et a/., 1988 Science 242:423-426; and Huston et a/., 1988 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 85:5879-5883). Such single chain antibodies are also intended to be encompassed within the term \"antigen- binding region\" of an antibody. These antibody fragments are obtained using conventional techniques known to those of skill in the art, and the fragments are screened for utility in the same manner as are intact antibodies. </p>An \"isolated antibody\", as used herein, refers to an antibody that is substantially free of other antibodies having different antigenic specificities (e.g., an isolated antibody that specifically binds ActRIIB is substantially free of antibodies that specifically bind antigens other than ActRIIB). An isolated antibody that specifically binds ActRIIB may, however, have cross-reactivity to other antigens, such as ActRIIB molecules from other species. Moreover, an isolated antibody may be substantially free of other cellular material and/or chemicals. The terms \"cross-block\", \"cross-blocked\" and \"cross-blocking\" are used interchangeably herein to mean the ability of an antibody or other binding agent to interfere with the binding of other antibodies or binding agents to ActRIIB, particularly the ligand binding domain, in a standard competitive binding assay. The terms \"monoclonal antibody\" or \"monoclonal antibody composition\" as used herein refer to a preparation of antibody molecules of single molecular composition. A monoclonal antibody composition displays a single binding specificity and affinity for a particular epitope. The term \"human antibody\", as used herein, is intended to include antibodies having variable regions in which both the framework and CDR regions are derived from sequences of human origin. Furthermore, if the antibody contains a constant region, the constant region also is derived from such human sequences, e.g. human germline sequences, or mutated versions of human germline sequences or antibody containing consensus framework sequences derived from human framework sequences analysis, for example, as described in Knappik, et al. (2000. J Mol Biol 296, 57-86). The human antibodies of the disclosure may include amino acid residues not encoded by human sequences (e.g. mutations introduced by random or site-specific mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic mutation in vivo). However, the term \"human antibody\", as used herein, is not intended to include antibodies in which CDR sequences derived from the germline of another mammalian species, such as a mouse, have been grafted onto human framework sequences. \n\n The term \"human monoclonal antibody\" refers to antibodies displaying a single binding specificity which have variable regions in which both the framework and CDR regions are derived from human sequ"
