These are the average ratio values during part or all of the pre-stimulation period, and during sample points during the stimulation period. The response to the stimulus R=R<sub>f</sub>/R<sub>i </sub>is then calculated. </p> Control responses are obtained by performing assays in the presence of a compound with the desired properties (positive control), such as tetracaine, and in the absence of pharmacological agents (negative control). Responses to the negative (N) and positive (P) controls are calculated as above. The compound antagonist activity A is defined as:  \nA=R-PN-P*100.\n\n where R is the ratio response of the test compound. \n</p>Electrophysiology Assays for NaV Activity and Inhibition of Test Compounds  Patch clamp electrophysiology was used to assess the efficacy and selectivity of sodium channel blockers in dorsal root ganglion neurons. Rat neurons were isolated from the dorsal root ganglions and maintained in culture for 2 to 10 days in the presence of NGF (50 ng/ml) (culture media consisted of NeurobasalA supplemented with B27, glutamine and antibiotics). Small diameter neurons (nociceptors, 8-12 \u03bcm in diameter) have been visually identified and probed with fine tip glass electrodes connected to an amplifier (Axon Instruments). The \u201cvoltage clamp\u201d mode has been used to assess the compound's IC50 holding the cells at \u221260 mV. In addition, the \u201ccurrent clamp\u201d mode has been employed to test the efficacy of the compounds in blocking action potential generation in response to current injections. The results of these experiments have contributed to the definition of the efficacy profile of the compounds. </p> Voltage-Clamp Assay in DRG Neurons </p> TTX-resistant sodium currents were recorded from DRG somata using the whole-cell variation of the patch clamp technique. Recordings were made at room temperature (\u02dc22o C) with thick walled borosilicate glass electrodes (WPI; resistance 3-4 M\u03a9) using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments). After establishing the whole-cell configuration, approximately 15 minutes were allowed for the pipette solution to equilibrate within the cell before beginning recording. Currents were lowpass filtered between 2-5 kHz and digitally sampled at 10 kHz. Series resistance was compensated 60-70% and was monitored continuously throughout the experiment. The liquid junction potential (\u22127 mV) between the intracellular pipette solution and the external recording solution was not accounted for in the data analysis. Test solutions were applied to the cells with a gravity driven fast perfusion system (SF-77; Warner Instruments). </p> Dose-response relationships were determined in voltage clamp mode by repeatedly depolarizing the cell from the experiment specific holding potential to a test potential of +10 mV once every 60 seconds.
