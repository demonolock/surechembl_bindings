    "topes are particularly useful in SPECT (single photon emission computerized tomography), all useful in brain imaging. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., <sup>2</sup>H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labeled compounds of formula I and following of this invention can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Schemes and/or in the Examples below, by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent. </p> The CRF receptor antagonists of the present invention demonstrate activity at the CRF receptor site including CRF 1 and CRF 2 receptors and may be used in the treatment of conditions mediated by CRF or CRF receptors. </p> The effectiveness of a compound as a CRF receptor antagonist may be determined by various assay methods. Suitable CRF antagonists of this invention are capable of inhibiting the specific binding of CRF to its receptor and antagonizing activities associated with CRF. A compound of structure (I) may be assessed for activity as a CRF antagonist by one or more generally accepted assays for this purpose, including (but not limited to) the assays disclosed by DeSouza et al. (J. Neuroscience 7: 88,1987) and Battaglia et al. (Synapse 1: 572,1987). </p> The CRF receptors-binding assay was performed by using the homogeneous technique of scintillation proximity (SPA). The ligand binds to recombinant membrane preparation expressing the CRF receptors which in turn bind to wheatgerm agglutinin coated SPA beads. In the Experimental Part will be disclosed the details of the experiments. </p> With reference to CRF receptor binding affinities, CRF receptor antagonists of this invention have a Ki less than 10 \u03bcm. </p> Compounds of the invention are useful in the treatment of central nervous system disorders where CRF receptors are involved. In particular in the treatment or prevention of major depressive disorders including bipolar depression, unipolar depression, single or recurrent major depressive episodes with or without psychotic features, catatonic features, melancholic features, atypical features or postpartum onset, the treatment of anxiety and the treatment of panic disorders. Other mood disorders encompassed within the term major depressive disorders include dysthymic disorder with early or late onset and with or without atypical features, neurotic depression, post traumatic stress disorders and social phobia; dementia of the Alzheimer's type, with early or late onset, with depressed mood; vascular dementia with depressed mood; mood disorders induced by alcohol, amphetamines, cocaine, hallucinogens, inhalants, opioids, phencyclidine, sedatives, hypnotics, anxiolytics and other substances; schizoaffective disorder of the depressed type; and adjustment disorder with depressed mood. Major depressive disorders may also result from a general medical condition including, but not limited to, myocardial infarction, diabetes, miscarriage or abortion, etc. </p> Compounds of the invention are also useful in the treatment or prevention of schizophrenic disorders including paranoid schizophrenia, disorganised schizophrenia, catatonic schizophrenia, undifferentiated sc"
