    " is also able to suppress gene transcription in a dimerisation- independent manner by interfering with the activity of transcription factors, such as AP-I and NFkB, which are critically involved in the inflammatory reaction.</p>After ligand binding, the GR translocates from the cytoplasm of the cell to the nucleus and binds to glucocorticoid response elements in regulator regions of target genes. The activated GR then recruits co-factors, including the glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP-I) and steroid receptor co-activator 1 (SRCl). These accessory proteins \n\n bind to the receptor and link the GR with the general transcription machinery to drive transcription of target genes.</p>Glucocorticoid effects on transcription may be mediated by both the direct binding of activated GR to target DNA, homodimerisation and recruitment of co-activators (known as \"transactivation\") but also by GR interfering with other transcription factor function, including AP-I and NFkB, by complexing with these other transcription factors and preventing them from binding to their target genes leading to repression of the genes normally upregulated by AP-I or NFkB (known as \"transrepression\"). These two modes of receptor activity are dissociable and negative effects on NFkB activity can be retained in the absence of transactivation. It appears that transrepression is largely responsible for mediating the therapeutically desirable anti-inflammatory activity of the GR. Interestingly, the IC50 for inhibition of AP-I or NFkB (0.04nM) is lower than the EC50 for activation of target genes (5nM) and yet high doses of GCs are frequently required to treat patients with inflammatory disease. One explanation is that cytokines expressed at the site of inflammation may induce relative glucocorticoid resistance, for instance by activating</p>AP-I or NFkB. This is of importance as many pro-inflammatory cytokines signal by activation of NFkB and a major anti-inflammatory action of GCs is thought to be mediated by opposing NFkB action.</p>Published Japanese Patent Application No. 60067495 describes certain pregnenopyrazoles as anti-inflammatory agents.</p>Our co-pending International Patent Application No. PCT/GB2008/050890 relates to compounds of formula \n\n</p><img id=\"imgf000004_0001\" path=\"imgf000004_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/168711635/WO/20101007/A1/002010/11/44/76/imgf000004_0001.tif\"/>\n wherein</p>X , X , X , X and X each independently represent CH or a nitrogen atom, provided</p>1 2 3 4 5 that no more than two of X , X , X , X and X may simultaneously represent a nitrogen atom; n and p each independently represent 0 or 1 ;</p>R represents a halogen atom or a methyl or a methoxy group;</p>R<sup>2</sup> represents a halogen atom, -C(O)OCH<sub>3</sub>, -C(O)-S-CH<sub>2</sub>CN, -C(O)-S-CH<sub>3</sub>,</p>-C(O)-heterocyclyl, -S\u03b82CH<sub>3</sub> , a C<sub>2</sub>-Cg alkenyl group, or a methyl group optionally</p>7 8 substituted by halogen, hydroxyl, methoxy, -OCH<sub>2</sub>CH=CH<sub>2</sub> or -NR R",

Also included in the kit are IM DTT (Panvera, Part number P2325, stored at -2O<sup>0</sup>C) and GR Screening buffer 1OX (Panvera, Part number P2814, stored at -7O<sup>0</sup>C initially but once thawed stored at room temperature). Avoid repeated freeze/thaws for all reagents. The GR Screening buffer 1OX comprises 10OmM potassium phosphate, 20OmM sodium molybdate, ImM EDTA and 20% DMSO.</p>Test compounds (l\u03bcL) and controls (l\u03bcL) in 100% DMSO were added to black polystyrene 384-well plates (Greiner low volume black flat-bottom, part number 784076). 0% control was 100%DMSO and 100% control was lO\u03bcM Dexamethasone. Background solution (8\u03bcL; assay buffer 10X, Stabilizing Peptide, DTT and ice cold MQ water) was added to the background wells. GS Red solution (7\u03bcL; assay buffer 10X, Stabilizing Peptide, DTT, GS Red and ice cold water) was added to all wells except background wells. GR solution (7\u03bcL; assay buffer 10X, Stabilizing Peptide, DTT, GR and ice cold water) was added to all wells. The plate was sealed and incubated in a dark at room temperature for 2 hours. The plate was read in an Analyst plate reader (LJL Biosystems/Molecular Devices Corporation) or other similar plate reader capable of recording fluorescence polarization (excitation wavelength 530 nm, emission wavelength 590 nm and a dichroic mirror at 561 nm). The IC50 values were calculated using XLfit model 205 and are shown in Table 1. \n\n Table 1</p><img id=\"imgf000087_0001\" path=\"imgf000087_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/168711699/WO/20101007/A1/002010/11/44/76/imgf000087_0001.tif\"/></p>"
