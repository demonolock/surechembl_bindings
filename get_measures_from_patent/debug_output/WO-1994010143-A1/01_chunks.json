Buffer at pH 7.5 was then added to a final volume of 100 ml. </p> Crude extract of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) containing elastase activity. </p> Inhibitors (azetidinones) to be tested dissolved in DMSO just before use. </p> To 1.0 ml of 0.2 mM Boc-AAPAN in a cuvette, 0.01-0.1 ml of DMSO with or without inhibitor was added. After mixing, a measurement was taken at 410 m\u03bc to detect any spontaneous hydrolysis due to presence of test compound. 0.05 Milliliters of PMN extract was then added and the \u0394OD/min at 410 m\u03bc was measured and recorded. Beckman model 35 spectrophotometer was used. </p> Results in Tables I to III were reported as ID<sub>50</sub>, effective dosage in micrograms per milliliter (\u03bcg/ml) for 50% inhibition of the enzyme activity 2 minutes after zero time. </p> Results were also expressed as Ki, the micromolar concentration of the inhibitor (\u03bcM) giving 50% of the control enzyme activity; or as <sup>k</sup>obs/I which is the second order rate constant in per mole per second for inactivation of the enzyme. </p> The elastase activity in the crude PMN extract may vary from one preparation to another. A control of each new batch is run, and the volume added in the assay procedure is adjusted according to activity. \n\n\n<img id=\"imgf000031_0001\" path=\"imgf000031_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/174773399/WO/19940511/A1/001994/01/01/43/imgf000031_0001.tif\"/>\n </p> ASSAY </p>The PR3 catalyzed hydrolysis of MeO-Succ-AAPV-pNA was measured in a spectrophotometer monitoring absorbance at 410 n,m. The enzymatic activity was determined in 45 mM TES at pH 7.5, 450 mM NaCl and 10 % DMSO. The data were fit by non-linear regression to equation 1 \n\nto obtain the initial rates. The nonlinear progress curves observed with time dependent inhibitors were fit to equation 2 to obtain the first order rate constant K<sub>obs</sub>.
