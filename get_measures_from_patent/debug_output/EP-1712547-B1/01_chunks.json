The plate was left at room temperature for 5 minutes and 10 \u00b5L of 0.1mmol/L H-Gly-Pro-AMC\u00b7HBr solution was added to each well to initiate the reaction. The plate was left in a dark environment at room temperature for 20 minutes, at which point 20\u00b5L 25% acetic acid was added to terminate the reaction. Using a fluorescent plate reader, the free AMC concentration was determined by exciting the samples at 355 nm and measuring the fluorescence intensity at 460 nm. Using Prism 3.02 (GraphPad Software), the results were analyzed to determine the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50). The results are shown in Table 1.</p>[Table 1]In vitro dipeptidylpeptidase IV inhibitory activityTest compoundIC 5 0 (nmol/L)Example 10. 2 5Example 90. 48Example 100. 2 3Example 110. 1 3Compound A3. 3</p>Compound A: (2S)-1-[[(3-hydroxy-1-adamantyl)amino]acetyl]-2-cyanopyrrolidine (LAF-237)&lt;Test Example 2&gt; [Test for the inhibition of dipeptidylpeptidase IV activity in mice by oral administration of the compounds of the invention]Each compound was suspended in 0.3% sodium carboxymethylcellulose to a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. The preparation was orally administered to 8-week old male ICR mice (Charles River Laboratories Japan) at a dose of 10 mL/kg. Using an EDTA 2K-treated capillary tube, blood samples were collected from the tail vein before administration and 30 minutes after administration. The blood samples were centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 2 minutes to separate plasma. The enzymatic activity was determined using the same procedure as in Test Example 1. The inhibition was determined from the decrease in the enzymatic activity from the initial activity (% inhibition = {(activity before administration - activity after administration)/(activity before administration)} x 100). The results are shown in Table 2.</p>[Table 2]Inhibition of plasma dipeptidylpeptidase IV activity by oral administrationTest compound% inhibitionExample 11 0 0Example 99 4Example 119 3Compound A8 1</p>Compound A: (2S)-1-[[(3-hydroxy-1-adamantyl)amino]acetyl]-2-cyanopyrrolidine (LAF-237)&lt;"
