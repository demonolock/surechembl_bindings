The meloxicam mechanism of action may be related to prostaglandin synthetase (cyclo-oxygenase, COX) inhibition which is involved in the initial steps of the arachidonic acid cascade, resulting in the reduced formation of prostaglandins, thromboxanes and prostacylin.</p>SUMMARYMeloxicam and some other NSAIDs have poor aqueous solubility which may reduce bioavailability and slow the onset of pain relief resulting from their use. One means of increasing the solubility and bioavailability of meloxicam is through the use of cyclodextrins. Cyclodextrin (also known as cycloamyloses) are generally cyclic polysaccharides which form a bucket-like shape. Cyclodextrins help to increase bioavailability of other molecules because cyclodextrins are hydrophobic on the inside and hydrophilic on the inside which helps to facilitate the transport of molecules. The naturally occurring cyclodextrins include six, seven, and eight glucose units (\u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3-cyclodextrin, respectively). However, synthetic cyclodextrins containing more or less glucose units are possible. In aqueous solutions, cyclodextrins can form complexes (i.e., an inclusion complex) with drugs by incorporating the drug into the center/hydrophobic portion of the cyclodextrin ring; although cyclodextrin compounds are also known to aggregate around a drug in a micelle-type structure. This ability of cyclodextrins may allow them to act as carriers to increase the bioavailability of less soluble drugs.</p>Some embodiments include a method of treating migraine comprising: selecting a human migraine patient with a history of inadequat",
    "ypertension. In addition to a history of inadequate response, enrolled patients exhibited a high rate of characteristics that are strongly associated with poor treatment outcomes including cutaneous allodynia (75.4%), severe migraine pain intensity (41.2%), obesity (43.7%), and morning migraine (36.6%). A total of 1,594 patients were randomized in a 2:2:2:1 ratio to the monolayer tablet of Example 4 (20 mg meloxicam/10 mg rizatriptan, with SBE\u03b2CD and sodium bicarbonate), rizatriptan (10 mg), meloxicam (20 mg) with SBE\u03b2CD (MoSEIC Meloxicam), or placebo, to treat a single migraine attack of moderate or severe intensity. The two co-primary endpoints of the trial were the proportion of patients who are free from headache pain two hours after dosing, and the proportion of patients who no longer suffered from their most bothersome migraine-associated symptom (nausea, photophobia, or phonophobia) two hours after dosing, for meloxicam/rizatriptan as compared to placebo. Superiority of meloxicam/rizatriptan to the rizatriptan and meloxicam arms (component contribution) was to be established based on sustained freedom from headache pain from two to 24 hours after dosing (key secondary endpoint). The study was conducted pursuant to an FDA Special Protocol Assessment (SPA). Rizatriptan, an active comparator in the trial, is considered to be the fastest acting oral triptan and one of the most effective medications currently available for the acute treatment of migraine. (Ferrari MD, Roon KI, Lipton RB, Goadsby PJ. Oral triptans (serotonin 5-HT(1B/1D) agonists) in acute migraine treatment: a meta-analysis of 53 trials. Lancet. 2001 Nov. 17; 358(9294):1668-75.)</p>Meloxicam/rizatriptan provided rapid relief of migraine pain with the percentage of patients achieving pain relief with meloxicam/rizatriptan being numerically greater than with rizatriptan at every time point measured starting at 15 minutes, and statistically significant by 60 minutes (p=0.04) (FIG. 14). The proportions of patients experiencing pain relief 1.5 hours after dosing were 60.5% for meloxicam/rizatriptan compared to 52.5% for rizatriptan and 48.3% for placebo (p=0.019, p=0.04, respectively versus meloxicam/rizatriptan) (FIG. 14). FIG. 14A shows the percentage of subjects reporting pain relief over placebo for meloxicam, rizatriptan, and meloxicam/rizatriptan at 1.0 hour and 1.5 hours.</p>Meloxicam/rizatriptan met the two regulatory co-primary endpoints by demonstrating, with high statistical significance, a greater percentage of patients as compared to placebo achieving pain freedom (19.9% versus 6.7%, p&lt;0.001, FIG. 15), and absence of most bothersome symptom (36.9% versus 24.4%, p=0.002), 2 hours after dosing.</p>Superiority of meloxicam/rizatriptan to rizatriptan (active comparator) and MoSEIC\u2122 meloxicam (component contribution) was established as specified in the SPA, by the demonstration of a greater percentage of patients receiving meloxicam/rizatriptan achieving sustained pain fre"
