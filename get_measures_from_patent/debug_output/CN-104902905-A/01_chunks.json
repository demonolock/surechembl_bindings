    "of medicine also to keep the long-acting release of medicine to provide raising of the present invention long-lasting in long-time upon administration to object simultaneously upon administration.Therefore, in one embodiment, LAP of the present invention can comprise two or more substantially different granularities, makes the release of formula I (or table 1 compound) early or late, and this type of different absorption dynamics be improve can lastingly depot drug product exposure approach.In one embodiment, formula I is particulate form, and the particle size of its compounds of formula I is about 0.05 \u03bcm to about 100 \u03bcm, and wherein said microgranule comprises two or more substantially different granularities.</p>In other embodiments again, be encapsulated in polymer-matrix microgranule by the drug particles of formula I (or any compound in table 1), described polymer-matrix microgranule optionally lyophilizing subsequently can be used for long term storage.When term \" encapsulation \" uses in the present invention, mean that formula I (or any compound in table 1) is surrounded by polymer substantially, even if some compounds may still be present on the surface of potting compound/polymer architecture.Before use, immediately can optionally by dry particle suspension in aqueous buffer solutions.Polymer for the preparation of this based fine particles can be selected from a series of biodegradable polymer, comprises poly-(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (M\n        <sub>w</sub>5-200 kD) and its derivant, such as polyethylene glycol groups amphipathic polymer etc.Particle size (D\n        <sub>50</sub>) can be about 1 \u03bcm to about 100 \u03bcm, drug pack can be about 10% to about 70% (w/w).In one embodiment, the drug particles of formula I (or any compound in table 1) is encapsulated into polymer-matrix microgranule such as to contain in those of Resomer.In another embodiment, the drug particles of formula I (or in table 1 any compound) is encapsulated into polymer-matrix microgranule such as containing Resomer 752S those in.\n      </p>In other embodiments, situ-gel may be used for packaged type I.This can for the mixable organic solvent based sols of water containing formula I and water-insoluble gel formation polymer.Once administration (IM or SC), organic solvent disperses and insoluble polymer is precipitated out to form the gel containing formula I.Then, along with polymer-matrix gel degradation in vivo, formula I slowly diffuses out.Polymer for the preparation of situ-gel is selected from a series of biodegradable polymer, comprises poly-(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (M\n        <sub>w</sub>5-200 kD) and its derivant, polyethylene glycol groups amphipathic polymer etc.Described organic solvent is selected from N-Methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), dimethyl sulfoxine (DMSO), dimethyl formamide (DMF), dimethyl acetylamide (DMA) etc.Described polymer concentration in organic solvent can be 1-50% (w/w), and formula I concentration can be 1-50% (w/w).\n      </p>Or described microparticle formulation can be prepared by spray drying method.Similarly, spray drying method is imposed to the organic solution containing the polymer selected by formula I and preparation as described herein, wherein organic solvent under nitrogen flowing rapid evaporation to form the microgranule of packaged type I.Baking temperature is not less than 35C, and solution spray rate is not less than 0.1 ml/min.For situ-gel microgranule, jointly can be dissolved in suitable organic solvent by formula I and selected polymer, wherein organic solvent must meet following standard: a) have for the good dissolubility of selected polymer; B) there is the compatibility good with aqueous solution; And c) there is when using in human body the safety of hypotoxicity and confirmation; Such as N-Methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), dimethyl sulfoxine (DMSO), dimethyl formamide (DMF), dimethyl acetylamide (DMA) etc.Gained solution containing formula I and selected polymer can be prepared by changing polymer and formula I ratio in polymer concentration, solvent, thus the gel formation speed controlled after administration and drug diSusio"
