    "is mediated by interaction with platelet ADP receptors. Utilizing the second assay the potency of inhibition of such compounds with respect to [<sup>3</sup>H]2-MeS-ADP binding to whole platelets is determined. [<sup>3</sup>H]2-MeS-ADP binding experiments are routinely performed with outdated human platelets collected by standard procedures at hospital blood banks. Apyrase-washed outdated platelets are prepared as follows (all steps at room temperature, if not indicated otherwise): </p> Outdated platelet suspensions are diluted with 1 volume of CGS and platelets pelleted by centrifugation at 1900\u00d7g for 45 minutes. Platelet pellets are resuspended at 3-6\u00d710<sup>9 </sup>platelets/ml in CGS containing 1 U/ml apyrase (grade V, Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) and incubated for 15 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. After centrifugation at 730\u00d7g for 20 minutes, pellets are resuspended in Hepes-Tyrode's buffer containing 0.1% BSA (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) at a concentration of 6.66\u00d710<sup>8 </sup>platelets/ml. Binding experiments are performed after &gt;45 minutes resting of the platelets. </p> Alternatively, binding experiments are performed with fresh human platelets prepared as described in I. (Inhibition of ADP-Mediated Platelet Aggregation in vitro), except that platelets are resuspended in Hepes-Tyrode's buffer containing 0.1% BSA (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) at a concentration of 6.66\u00d710<sup>8 </sup>platelets/ml. Very similar results are obtained with fresh and outdated platelets. </p> A platelet ADP receptor binding assay using the tritiated potent agonist ligand [<sup>3</sup>H]2-MeS-ADP (Jantzen, H. M. et al. (1999) Thromb. Hemost. 81:111-117) has been adapted to the 96-well microtiter format. In an assay volume of 0.2 ml Hepes-Tyrode's buffer with 0.1% BSA and 0.6% DMSO, 1\u00d710<sup>8 </sup>apyrase-washed platelets are preincubated in 96-well flat bottom microtiter plates for 5 minutes with serial dilutions of test compounds before addition of 1 nM [<sup>3</sup>H]2-MeS-ADP ([<sup>3</sup>H]2-methylthioadenosine-5\u2032-diphosphate, ammonium salt; specific activity 48-49 Ci/mmole, obtained by custom synthesis from Amersham Life Science, Inc., Arlington Heights, Ill., or NEN Life Science Products, Boston, Mass.). Total binding is determined in the absence of test compounds. Samples for nonspecific binding may contain 10<sup>\u22125 </sup>M unlabelled 2-MeS-ADP (RBI, Natick, Mass.). After incubation for 15 minutes at room temperature, unbound radioligand is separated by rapid filtration and two washes with cold (4-8\u00b0 C.) Binding Wash Buffer (10 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 138 mM NaCl) using a 96-well cell harvester (Minidisc 96, Skatron Instruments, Sterling, Va.) and 8\u00d712 GF/C glassfiber filtermats (Printed Filtermat A, for 1450 Microbeta, Wallac Inc., Gaithersburg, Md.). The platelet-bound radioactivity on the filtermats is determined in a scintillation counter (Microbeta 1450, Wallac Inc., Gaithersburg, Md.). Specific binding is determined by subtraction-specific binding from total binding, and specifi"
