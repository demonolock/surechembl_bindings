    "In other words, if a compound causes a certain change in body temperature under normal conditions, it is impossible to tell in advance what would be the effect of the same compound when it is administered under different thermal conditions. For example, many cyclooxygenase inhibitors decrease body temperature during fever, but do not affect (at the same doses) normal body temperature and, in some conditions, may even cause hyperthermia (see, e.g., Aronoff DM, et al., Prog Brain Res 162: 15-25, 2007). Many compounds (e.g., prostaglandin E<sub>1</sub>, prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>, and cholecystominin-8) cause pronounced hyperthermia at a lower body temperature in rats, but produce a smaller hyperthermic effect or no effect (see, e.g., Szelenyi Z, et al., Brain Res 638: 69-77, 1994) or even hypothermia (see, e.g., Morimoto A, et al., Physiol Behav 50: 249-53, 1991) at a higher body temperature in the same species. Several substances (e.g., platelet-activating factor (see, e.g., Ivanov Al, et al., J Physiol 553: 221-8, 2003) and lipopolysaccharide (see, e.g., Steiner AA, et al., Prog Lipid Res 46: 89-107, 2007) produce hyperthermia in a thermoneutral (normal) environment, but cause deep hypothermia (due to a decrease in thermogenesis (see, e.g., Romanovsky AA, et al., Am J Physiol 270: R693-703, 1996) at just slightly lower than ambient temperatures. Similarly, norepinephrine increases thermogenesis in a warm environment, but decreases thermogenesis in the cold (see, e.g., Zylan KD, Carlisle HJ. Pharmacol Biochem Behav 43: 577-82, 1992). Indeed, that fact that TRPV1 antagonists raise body temperature in unanesthetized humans and laboratory animals by 1-2\u00b0C to a range of 38-39\u00b0C or higher does not allow one to predict whether and how they will affect body temperature under anesthesia.</p>Experiments conducted during the course of developing embodiments for the present invention further investigated the activity of pharmaceutical agents in subjects that are \"anesthetized\" versus \"non-anesthetized.\" It was determined that while certain TRPV1 antagonists (e.g., AMG517, MK-2295, AZD1386, AMG 9810, and ABT 102) are able to cause hyperthermia in non-anesthetized rats and humans, other TRPV1 antagonists (e.g., capsazepine SB366791, and A-1165442) were unable to cause hyperthermia in non-anesthetized rats (see, Voight, et al., J. Med. Chem. 2014 Sep 11:57(17) 7412-24; Garami, et al., 2010 J. Neurosci. 30(4): 1435-1440). This observation indicated that the ability or inability of a TRPV1 antagonist to inhibit hypothermia in non-anesthetized subjects is unrelated to its ability to reverse hypothermia in anesthetized rats. Additional experiments further investigated this unique and unexpected \"anesthesia-specific\" effect for TRPV1 antagonists. Such experiments demonstrated TRPV1 antagonists have an anti-hypothermic effect that is highly advantageous in a perioperative setting to inhibit and/or counterbalance anesthesia-induced hypothermia.</p>Moreover, experimen"
