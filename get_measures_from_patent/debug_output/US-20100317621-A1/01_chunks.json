    "patient; the severity of the patient's symptoms; and the chosen route of administration.</p>Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, for example, for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compounds which exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. While compounds that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such compounds to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects.</p>The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the methods disclosed herein, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.</p>Inhibition of Bacterial GrowthThe present disclosure also provides methods for inhibiting bacterial growth, by e.g. reducing bacterial resistance to a \u03b2-lactam antibiotic, such methods comprising contacting a bacterial cell culture, or a bacterially infected cell culture, tissue, or organism, with a beta-lactamase inhibitor described herein. Preferably, the bacteria to be inhibited by administration of a beta-lactamase inhibitor of the invention are bacteria that are resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. More preferably, the bacteria to be inhibited are beta-lactamase positive strains that are highly resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. The terms \u201cresistant\u201d and \u201chighly resistant\u201d are well-understood by those of ordinary skill in the art (see, e.g., Payne et al., Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy 38:767-772 (1994); Hanaki et al., Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy 30:1120-1126 (1995)). Preferably, highly resistant bacterial strains are those against which the MIC of methicillin is &gt;100 \u03bcg/mL. Preferably, slightly resistant bacterial strains are those against which the MIC of methicillin is &gt;25 \u03bcg/mL.</p>These methods are useful for inhibiting bacterial grow"
