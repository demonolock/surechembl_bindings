    " by infiltration, it can be dispensed with an infiltration flask containing water or saline solution of pharmaceutical quality. When the composition is administered by injection, an ampoule of water for injection or sterile saline solution can be provided, therefore the ingredients can be mixed before the administration.</p>The amount of the ChoK\u03b2 activity-inducing compound which will be effective in the treatment of cancer can be determined by clinical standard techniques based on the present description. Furthermore, in vitro assays can be optionally used to aid in identifying the optimum dosage intervals. The precise dose to be used in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration, and the severity of the disease, and it must be decided according to the judgment of the doctor and the circumstances of each subject. However, suitable dose intervals for intravenous administration are generally approximately 50-5000 micrograms of active compound per kilogram of body weight. The suitable dosage intervals for intranasal administration are generally approximately 0.01 pg/kg of body weight to 1 mg/kg of body weight. The effective dose can be extrapolated from dose response curves derived from in vitro or animal assay model systems.</p>For the systemic administration, a therapeutically effective dose can be initially estimated from in vitro assays. For example, a dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating concentration interval including the IC50 which has been determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to determine the useful dose in humans more precisely. The initial doses can also be estimated from in vivo data, e.g., animal models, using techniques which are well known in the art. A person having ordinary skill in the art may easily optimize the administration to humans based on the data in animals.</p>Other aspects of the inventionIn additional aspects, the invention relates to:\n[1] - A Chok\u03b2 enzyme expression vector to be used in a gene therapy method inhibiting the Chok\u03b1 enzyme intended for the treatment of cancer.[2] - A Chok\u03b2 enzyme expression vector to be used in a gene therapy method inhibiting the Chok\u03b1 enzyme intended for the treatment of lung, breast, bladder or colorectal cancer.[3] - An expression vector according to [1] or [2], characterized by being a virus.[4] - Use of a Chok\u03b2 enzyme expression vector as an antioncogenic Chok\u03b1 enzyme-inhibiting agent.[5] - Use of a Chok\u03b2 enzyme expression vector for preparing gene therapy compositions inhibiting the Chok\u03b1 enzyme expression intended for the treatment of cancer.[6] - Use according to [5], characterized in that the cancer is lung, breast, bladder or colorectal cancer.[7] - Use according to [4] to [6], characterized in that the vector is a virus.[8] - A gene therapy composition characterized by comprising a Chok\u03b2 enzyme expression vector capable of inhibiting the Chok\u03b1 enzyme.[9] - A cell transfected by a Chok\u03b2 enzyme expression vecto"
