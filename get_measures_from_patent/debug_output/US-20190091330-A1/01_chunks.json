(0.3 \u03bcg/100 \u03bcl PBS)+4-HPR releasing PLGA implant. In previous studies that employed younger mice tumors of varying sizes were disbursed among all treatment groups. Due to the older age of mice &gt;6 weeks and the accompanying cage aggression tumor size distribution was not feasible in these studies. As a result, mean tumor volumes varied appreciably among treatment groups. PLGA implants (trocar placement) and injections were placed in the center of the tumor. Fluid dispersion throughout tumor was noted during injections. At day 28 post OSCC xenograft placement the mice were sacrificed, OSCC tumors along with lung and liver tissues and sera were harvested (for PK and histologic analyses). These data show three groups i.e. TOC, TOC+4-HPR, and triple treatment (TOC+2-ME+4-HPR) were the only treatments that prevented a significant increase in tumor volume (paired t test). Provided the discrepancy in pretreatment tumor volumes (TOC the lowest, triple treatment second highest with its mean nearly two fold higher than TOC mean), the TOC+2-ME+4-HPR data are especially creditable.</p>FIG. 6B shows Ki-67 and cleaved caspase 3 immunohistochemical stains to assess qualitative treatment effects on tumor cells' proliferation and apoptosis. IHC images representative of all of the groups are presented. The PLGA implants are visible as a clear cylindrical object in every photomicrograph except the TOC and 2-ME+TOC treatment. To facilitate PLGA implant recognition, arrows have been placed within the implants. Both the Ki-67 and caspase 3 stains are located within the nucleus. Qualitative Ki67 staining assessment was most apparent at the periphery of the tumors in all groups. In contrast to the abundant Ki-67 staining, cleaved caspase 3 was not nearly as prominent.</p>FIG. 6C shows bar graphs quantifying the Ki-67 and cleaved caspase 3 immunohistochemical stains. The image analysis revealed that all treatments suppressed tumor cell proliferation relative to the untreated tumor. Furthermore, significant inhibition of proliferation (as assessed by % of tumor cells demonstrating Ki-67 labeling) was seen in these groups: 2-ME+4-HPR+TOC, TOC+4-HPR, 2-ME+TOC (all p&lt;0.001) and 2-ME+4-HPR (p&lt;0.05) Kruskal Wallis with Dunns' Multiple Comparison post hoc test. Although cleaved caspase 3 nuclear staining was present, none of the treatments showed any significant effects relative to the matched control tumors. Image analysis did not reveal any inter-group differences with regard to caspase 3 labeling.

    "actic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), acid-capped, MW 13-24 kDa. The suspension is extruded with a syringe into silicone rubber tubing before drying under vacuum. This polymer provides 4-6 week sustained polymer erosion and typically releases drugs without a lag time, commonly observed with higher molecular weight PLGAs and drug load is typically 10-50%. Solubilizers for co-encapsulation can include deoxycholate salts, Pluronic F127, Brij 35, and \u03b2-cyclodextrin.</p>Drug loading can be determined by HPLC after extraction with THF/ethanol. In vitro release can be determined at 37\u00b0 C. under perfect sink conditions using PBS+0.084% Tween 80, which provides the same fenretinide solubility (21 \u03bcg/mL) as found in bovine serum.</p>In one embodiment, 2-ME in PLGA can maximize drug loading and facilitate continuous release of the steroid over the correct time scale of release in vivo. Maximizing drug loading can provide more flexibility for dosing and increase the probability of attaining local therapeutic levels. IN one embodiment, the steroid is slowly and continuously released for &gt;1 month in vitro from two different low molecular weight acid-capped PLGA 50/50s at 10% 2-ME loading. The drug release could also be strongly increased by numerous additives (for example \u03b2-cyclodextrin, Pluronic F127, or PEG8000) to affect the drug solubility and/or pore formation of the polymer throughout the release period.</p>2-ME with/without excipients can be combined with acid-capped PLGA 50/50 (13-24 kD) in acetone and extruded. Drug loading is typically about 10-50%. Drug loading can be determined by HPLC after dissolving implants in acetonitrile. Release kinetics in vitro can be performed in PBS+0.02% Tween 80 (PBST) at 37\u00b0 C. under perfect sink conditions with HPLC detection.</p>The anti-IL-6 receptor IgG1\u03ba monoclonal antibody (MAb), tocilizumab (TOC) can also be formulated in PLGA. This can increase the (1) stability of the protein and (2) manage the elevated level of small molecule excipients necessary to stabilize the protein. The millicylindrical configuration can provide distinct protein stability advantages owing to: (1) the encapsulation is anhydrous, which allows the protein to avoid contact the organic solvent while in the solution state, which in turn minimizes protein unfolding and aggregation as often occurs at water-organic solvent interfaces; and (2) the larger configuration only requires solid protein particles for encapsulation &lt;90 \u03bcm, and therefore, avoids the extensive (and sometimes damaging) micronization of the protein (necessary for microspheres). To inhibit the pH drop resulting from a build-up of acidic degradation products during biodegradation of the PLGA polyester (i.e., each ester bond cleaved produces one new carboxylic acid), a poorly soluble base such as Mg(OH)2 and MgCO3 can successfully manage the lower microclimate pH over a sufficient time window to allow the protein to be safely released from the polymer.</p>TOC is currently available in two different formulations, in solution for IV infusion and SC injection, both of which contain multiple stabilizing small molecules to maintain the shelf life of the product. These small molecules when encapsulated in PLGA can give rise to significant osmotic pressures, making it difficult to avoid all the protein from coming out immediately after administration.</p>The components of Actemra\u00ae solution containing TOC can be exchanged into histidine buffer pH 6 before adjustment of excipient content before freeze-drying. The solid can then be ground with a CryoMill before sieving through 90-\u03bcm screen. The solid powder can be suspended at 10% TOC theoretical loading in PLGA 50/50 end-capped (Mw\u02dc60 kD)+3% MgCO3/acetone solution and extruded into silicone rubber before ambient and vacuum drying (40\u00b0 C.). For coated implants, the core implants can be placed back into silicone tubing and blank PLGA solution in acetone can be extruded over the core implants to coat before drying.</p>For determination of MAb loading, the polymer can be dissolved first in acetone to remove the polymer without dissolving the protein. After repeating 3\u00d7 and evaporation of the solvent, the protein is reconstituted in aqueous solution and assayed by both size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and sandwich ELISA (AbD Serotec), and other structural assays as needed. In vitro release can be conducted at 37\u00b0 C. in PBST as for 2-ME, except analysis can be by SEC and ELISA. Although ELISA is expected to mimic Mab native structure, higher order structural analysis of TOC can be performed using circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy.</p>For 2-ME and TOC, in vivo release can be commenced once formulations are obtained based on in vitro analysis (i.e., &gt;5-10% loading, &lt;20% 1-day initial burst release, continuous release of 80% over 1 month of stable drug). To characterize implant release in test formulations of poly (lactic-co-glycolic) (PLGA) millicylinders in vivo, 120 7-week old female Sprague Dawley rats are used. Each rat can receive 6 implants. Each formulation is tested in triplicate.</p>All millicylinder implants can be chemically analyzed and weighed prior to implantation. Following e",

Sera-free conditioned media for IL-6, VEGF, TGF-\u03b1 and EGF were analyzed by ELISAs (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.), with data expressed as pg/10<sup>6 </sup>cells.</p>Molecular Modeling Studies to Assess 4-HPR-STAT3 and Related Kinases, c-Src and c-Abl Interactions.</p>Molecular modeling studies to evaluate 4-HPR's interactions and potential binding to STAT3's, c-Src's and c-Abl's associated tyrosine kinases and other sites were conducted using AutoDock Vina software [27] with protein structures obtained from the Protein databank [28]. STAT3, c-Src and c-Abl structures were optimized using Yasara and the default minimization algorithm. All ligands were constructed in Spartan10 and minimized using Merck molecular force field. The optimized protein structures and ligands were docked using AutoDock Vina using an exhaustiveness of 100. Each calculation was repeated three times to ensure a thorough exploration of the binding site. Calculated binding free energies were used to determine a binding affinity (Ka) and dissociation constant (Kd) to compare to experimental data. \u0394G=RT ln(Ka) or Ka=e<sup>\u2212(\u0394G/RT) </sup>and Kd=1/Ka. As c-Src can adopt one of two distinct conformations i.e. inactive (closed confirmation) and active (open), 4-HPR interactions were evaluated using both conformations. Similarly, c-Abl also has two formations i.e. inactive DFG-in and active DFG-out and both conformations were analyzed with the same common set of ligands at the ATP binding site.</p>4-HPR's Effects on Tumorsphere Formation and Retention of Proliferative Capacity.5\u00d710<sup>5 </sup>JSCC1 cells (tumorsphere-formation competent unlike JSCC2 and JSCC3 cells) were plated in complete medium with either vehicle control (0.01% DMSO) or 5 \u03bcM 4-HPR in Corning Ultra-Low attachment tissue culture flasks (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) Suspension cultures received fresh medium and treatment q d for 7 days, with daily images capture via the Nikon DS-Ri+NIS Element. After 7 days, cells and medium were harvested, centrifuged, and cells replated in standard culture flasks containing complete medium. Images were obtained daily and cells harvested after 7 days in culture. Cell number (hemocytometer counts) and viability (trypan blue exclusion) were obtained.</p>Single and Combined Treatment Effects on Signaling, Transcription Factor Activation and DNA Bnding, and Cytokine Release.Twenty four hour sera-deprived cells were treated for an additional 24 hours in sera free media with the following: 1) 0.01% DMSO (vehicle control), 2) 5 \u03bcM 4-HPR, 3) 2.5 \u03bcM 2-ME, 4) 1 \u03bcg/ml tocilizumab (TOC, \u02dc2.55 \u03bcM) 5) 5 \u03bcM 4-HPR+2.5 \u03bcM 2-ME, 6",
    "c cells [10<sup>6 </sup>cells suspended in 100 \u03bcl Matrigel (Corning Life Sciences, Corning, N.Y.)] were subcutaneously injected in the flanks of 6 week old male nude mice (n=6 per treatment group). Tumor measurements were recorded daily with calipers (greatest length and greatest width) and final tumor volumes calculated via tumor volume V=(length\u00d7width)\u00d7\u00bd. Treatment groups consisted of: 1) control (PBS injections)+blank (no drug) PLGA implants, 2) 2-ME (1 \u03bcg/100 \u03bcl PBS, b.i.d.)+blank PLGA implant, 3) 4-HPR releasing PLGA implant+PBS injections, 4) TOC q.d.

(0.3\u03bcg/100 \u03bcl PBS)+4-HPR releasing PLGA implant. By day 14 post injection, all mice had measurable tumors and treatment began on day 15. Attempts to achieve uniform tumor size distribution among groups by animal transfer resulted in aggression toward the new cage mates. Pretreatment mean tumor volumes therefore varied among treatment groups. PLGA implants (via trocar) and injections were placed in the center of the tumor. At day 28 post OSCC xenograft placement final tumor measurements were obtained, the mice were euthanized and OSCC tumors along with lung, liver and sera were harvested for pharmacokinetic, histologic and IHC analyses (Ki-67, cleaved caspase-3 and involucrin). Image analyses of the nuclear stains (Ki-67 and cleaved caspase 3) were conducted using Image-Pro Plus 6.2 software (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, Md.).</p>Statistical Analyses:Data normality (Shapiro Wilks normality test) determined whether parametric or nonparametric analyses were employed. The Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test was used to assess the effects of 4-HPR treatment on STAT3 activation. Effects of combination treatments on STAT3-DNA binding and cytokine release as well as image analyzed IHC tumor data were evaluated by the Kruskal Wallis ANOVA followed by the Dunn's Multiple Comparison post-hoc test (individual cell lines, IHC data) or One Way ANOVA, followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test (combined cell line data). A paired t test (pre versus post treatment individual tumor measurement) was used to assess the effects of treatment on tumor volume.</p>ResultsJSCC Cells Retain Features of Their Corresponding Tumor Tissues.All JSCC lines contained dual cytokeratin and vimentin staining cells. Normal oral epithelia showed sparse pSTAT3 and no pEGFR nuclear staining in basal cells with modest increases noted following ulceration. Cell-matched tumor tissues, however, showed membrane-associated pEGFR with highest expression in the JSCC2 tumor tissue. pSTAT3 nuclear staining was highest in the JSCC1 and JSCC2 tumors; similar to corresponding cells lines' constitutive STAT3 phosphorylation. All three JSCC lines also demonstrated constitutive EGFR and/or STAT3 signaling similar to their correspondin",
    "JSCC1 and JSCC2 cells respectively. Two treatments i.e. TOC and the 4-HPR, 2-ME and TOC triple treatment significantly reduced sIL-6R release (FIG. 5B).</p>Studies to assess effects of treatment on binding of the NF-\u03baB subunits p65 and p50 showed modest reduction only in the 2095sc (p65) and JSCC2 (both) cell lines.</p>In vivo Studies Show Benefits of Tumor-Directed, Multimodal Therapy.</p>All mice injected with Matrigel-2095sc cells developed OSCC tumors. Although all OSCC xenografts were well-vascularized, necrotic foci were observed in regions with high proliferation indices and adjacent to 4-HPR implants. Lymphovascular (several mice) and perineural (single mouse) invasion by tumor cells were observed in the 2-ME treatment group; the mouse with perineural invasion had lung metastases at sacrifice. Pretreatment tumor volumes varied appreciably within and among treatment groups (FIG. 6), findings that may reflect variations in tumor growth capacity including angiogenesis. Only the TOC, TOC+4-HPR implant, and TOC+2-ME+4-HPR implant treatments prevented a significant increase in tumor volume over 14 days (See FIG. 6A). Notably, the TOC+2-ME+4-HPR implant group's mean pretreatment tumor volumes were nearly two fold higher than TOC group. The mean tumor fold size increases for the TOC and TOC+2-ME +4-HPR treatments were 2.13 and 1.72, respectively. 4-HPR implants released between 300-370 \u03bcg drug and achieved tissue levels of 331+/\u2212134 \u03bcM. IHC image analysis of the OSCC tumors' Ki-67 staining revealed that while all treatments decreased OSCC cell proliferation relative to control tumors, significant suppression was only observed in selected groups [2ME+TOC+4-HPR, TOC+4-HPR, 2-ME+TOC p\u22640.001; 2-ME+4-HPR p\u22640.05] (FIG. 6). Finally, although treatments occurred just below the skin, no disruption, ulceration or histologic changes were observed in the overlying epidermis. Ki-67 staining was apparent in the basal layer keratinocytes consistent with normal proliferation. UPLC/UV analyses showed no evidence of the oxidized metabolite 4-oxo-4-HPR when compared to the calibration standard in either the tumor or sera samples. Furthermore, 4-HPR sera levels were below LLOQ (&lt;50 ng/ml) in all mice that received PLGA implants.</p>DiscussionThis example evaluated multifaceted chemopreventives' abilities to suppress OSCC tumor-promoting pathways i.e. gratuitous signaling, constitutive transcription factor activation and DNA binding, anchorage independent growth and tumorigenesis [21-25]. Collectively, these results show combinations of agents with complementary mechanisms of action provided enhanced efficacy at both the in vitro and in vivo levels.</p>Afatinib and Vargatef signaling inhibition was cell-line dependent and negatively correlated with constitutive ERK1/2 and STAT3 signaling. There were also marked inter-line differences in both the numbers and levels of cytokines produced. Consistent with the STAT3-IL-6 feed forward loop, lines with constitutive STAT3 activation released higher IL-6 levels. IL-6 levels detected (range \u02dc100-1,600 pg/10<sup>6 </sup>cells) were comparable to IL-6 release from other human cancer cells (ovarian 100-200 pg/10<sup>6 </sup>cells, prostate 850-1250 pg/10<sup>6 </sup>cells) [32, 33]. Similarly, VEGF release (range \u02dc1,000-3,000 pg/10<sup>6 </sup>cells) also compared favorably to previous OSCC cell data (1,500 pg/10<",
    "p.) suppressed growth of established tumors [47]. The lack of 2-ME efficacy to reduce tumor size in these studies likely reflects both drug instability (\u02dc4 h half-life) and use of appreciably (&gt;2,000) lower doses. Additionally, tocilizumab (100 \u03bcg i.p.) significantly reduced HNSCC tumor initiation in scid mice; however this treatment didn't significantly inhibit established tumor growth [48]. In contrast, the data showed appreciably lower local tocilizumab doses (0.3 \u03bcg q.d.) significantly inhibited OSCC tumor growth. Further, as systemic tocilizumab can cause significant immune suppression, local delivery is preferable from both efficacy and safety perspectives. Despite achieving tumor 4-HPR levels that were appreciably greater than apoptosis-inducing 10 \u03bcM [21], 4-HPR implants only significantly inhibited tumor growth when used with other agents. These data show that released 4-HPR was largely inaccessible to the tumors, potentially due to high affinity binding to centrally located residual Matrigel and extravasted erythrocytes. Previous results from pilot studies, which entailed placement of two 4-HPR releasing implants adjacent to OSCC tumors, demonstrated significant tumor inhibition and emphasize the importance of both implant location and number. Finally, the absence of any detectable levels of 4-HPR or its metabolites in the sera of any animals emphasizes the safety of PLGA local drug delivery.</p>IHC studies provided further insights into treatment-tumor effects. Ki-67 labeling was most apparent at tumor peripheries; findings consistent with relatively hypoxic tumor cores. Quantitative Ki-67 analyses revealed that any treatment reduced tumor cell proliferation while significant reduction in tumor cell labeling was present in the triple treatment, TOC+4-HPR, 2-ME+TOC and 2ME+4-HPR groups (see FIG. 6B and 6C). As the tumors in the 4-HPR group were so large, part of the Ki-67 decrease may reflect necrotic tumor foci due to inadequate angiogenesis to support the tumor mass. Although two established apoptosis-inducing drugs (2-ME and 4-HPR) were employed, low levels of cleaved caspase 3 were detected in all groups (FIGS. 6. and 6C). These data may reflect both a relatively short half-life (\u02dc8 hours for activated caspase 3 [49]) and additional forms of cancer cell death including necrosis, senescence and autophagy [50]. Treatment effects on differentiation were evaluated by involucrin staining. While all experimental groups contained involucrin, qualitatively the most intense expression was observed in the 2-ME and 4-HPR+TOC groups. Despite the challenges of daily injections of drugs with short or intermediate half-lives (2-ME\u02dc4 h, TOC\u02dc0.8 days), pH dependent binding (acidic pH decreases TOC binding), and limited diffusion capacity (4-HPR), the data show efficacy of the selected chemopreventives to suppress growth in established OSCC tumors. These data show the chemopreventives' ability to abort microtumor foci. Finally, the absence of deleterious effects to the overlying epidermis emphasizes the chemopreventives' safety during local delivery.</p>Risk reduction and primary chemoprevention clearly remain the optimal OSCC management approach. Provided the often fatal consequences of recurrent OSCCs and lack of effective intervention options to prevent tumor recurrence, development of a well-tolerated and effective secondary chemoprevention strate"
