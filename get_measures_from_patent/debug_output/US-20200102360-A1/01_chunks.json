    "or granulocytes. Up-regulation of CCL18 levels in both tumor tissue and blood has been described in cancer, and CCL18 serum levels have been proposed as biomarker for several tumor types. In multiple cases, a correlation with advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis has been shown (e.g. gastric cancer (Wu et al., 2013a), breast cancer (Chen et al., 2011; Narita et al., 2011), prostate cancer (Chen et al., 2014), bladder cancer (Urquidi et al., 2012)). Serum levels of CCL18 were increased in NSCLC patients as compared to healthy controls. In addition, increased serum levels predicted a diminished survival time in patients with adenocarcinoma (Plones et al., 2012). CCL18 is part of a 12-protein serum biomarker panel proposed for identification of NSCLC (Ostroff et al., 2010).</p>Matrix metallopeptidase 12 (macrophage elastase) (MMP12)\u2014MMP12, also known as human metalloelastase (HME) or macrophage metalloelastase (MME) is a zinc endopeptidase recognized for its ability to degrade elastin. Apart from that, it has a broad substrate range, extending to other matrix proteins such as collagens, fibronectin, laminin, proteoglycans, and non-matrix proteins such as alpha-1-antitrypsin. In asthma, emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), MMP12 may contribute to alveolar destruction and airway remodeling (Cataldo et al., 2003; Wallace et al., 2008). MMP12 has been implicated in macrophage migration, and as it can generate angiostatin from plasminogen, it contributes to inhibition of angiogenesis (Chakraborti et al., 2003; Chandler et al., 1996; Sang, 1998). Like other metalloproteinases, MMP12 is involved in physiological processes like embryogenesis, wound healing and the menstrual cycle (Chakraborti et al., 2003; Labied et al., 2009), but also in pathological processes of tissue destruction. Although data are based on low numbers of patients in several cases, there is ample evidence in literature that MMP12 is frequently over-expressed in cancer (Denys et al., 2004; Hagemann et al., 2001; Ma et al., 2009; Vazquez-Ortiz et al., 2005; Ye et al., 2008). However, data are controversial with respect to the impact of MMP12 over-expression on clinical parameters and prognosis. While it may be involved in matrix dissolution and, thus, metastasis, it can also inhibit tumor growth through production of angiostatin, which negatively impacts angiogenesis (Gorrin-Rivas et al., 2000; Gorrin Rivas et al., 1998; Kim et al., 2004). For lung cancer, consequences of MMP12 expression are controversial. MMP12 over-expression in epithelial cells has been reported in inflammation-triggered lung remodeling. MMP12 up-regulation may play a role in emphysema-to-lung cancer transition (Qu et al., 2009). Animal studies suggest that MMP12 expression by stroma or macrophages suppresses growth of lung tumors (Acuff et al., 2006; Houghton et al., 2006). However, there are also reports that MMP12 over-expression in lung tumors correlates with recurrence, metastatic diseas",
    "oulos et al., 2011). DYRK2 controls the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer by degrading Snail (Mimoto et al., 2013). DYRK2 regulates p53 to induce apoptosis and enhances the response to DNA damage: upon exposure to genotoxic stress, DYRK2 translocates into the nucleus and activates p53 by phosphorylation (Meulmeester and Jochemsen, 2008; Taira et al., 2007). The DYRK4 gene maps to chromosome 12p13.32, which was described as a susceptibility locus for CRC as the CCND2 gene is affected (Jia et al., 2013; Peters et al., 2013). Some studies have highlighted a role of DYRK4 in neuronal differentiation (Leypoldt et al., 2001; Slepak et al., 2012).</p>ERO1-like (S. cerevisiae) ERO1 L\u2014ERO1-like protein alpha is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ERO1L gene. ERO1-\u03b1 is an oxidizing enzyme that exists in the endoplasmic reticulum and is induced under hypoxia. ERO1-\u03b1 is overexpressed in a variety of tumor types. Moreover, the cancer-associated ERO1-\u03b1 regulates the expression of the MHC class I molecule via oxidative folding (Kukita et al., 2015). It has been suggested that the expression of hERO1-\u03b1 in cancer cells is associated with poorer prognosis and thus can be a prognostic factor for patients with breast cancer (Kutomi et al., 2013). In natural human tumors, ERO1 L mRNA was specifically induced in hypoxic microenvironments coinciding with that of upregulated VEGF expression. It has been shown, that reduction in ERO1L production via siRNA leads to significant inhibition of VEGF secretion, a compromised proliferation capacity and enhanced apoptosis (May et al., 2005).</p>Family with sequence similarity 83, member A (FAM83A)\u2014FAM83A was determined to be elevated in several diverse cancer tissue types (Cipriano et al., 2014). However, the function of FAM83A remains unclear (Boyer et al., 2013). FAM83A was predicted a tumor-specific gene in lung cancer and its expression in lung cancer samples has been confirmed experimentally. Expression was especially high in adenocarcinoma (Li et al., 2005). Others reported a correlation with lung cancer disease progression (Liu et al., 2008).</p>Fragile X mental retardation, autosomal homolog 1 (FXR1)\u2014The protein encoded by the FXR1 gene is an RNA binding protein that interacts with the functionally-similar proteins FMR1 and FXR2. FXR1 is deregulated in a variety of human disorders including cancer. FXR1 acted as an oncogene which could increase the proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells (Jin et al., 2015). FXR1 is a novel cancer gene in NSCLC and FXR1 executes its regulatory function by forming a novel complex with two other oncogenes, protein kinase C, iota (PRKCI) and epithelial cell transforming 2 (ECT2) within the same amplicon in lung cancer cell (Qian et al., 2015b). It has been reported, that increased FXR1 expression in NSCLC is a candidate biomarker predictive of poor survival and might represent a novel therapeutic target. In addition, FXR1 expression correlates with poor",
    "all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin.</p>Methods for humanizing non-human antibodies are well known in the art. Generally, a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non-human. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as \u201cimport\u201d residues, which are typically taken from an \u201cimport\u201d variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly, such \u201chumanized\u201d antibodies are chimeric antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567), wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.</p>Transgenic animals (e.g., mice) that are capable, upon immunization, of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production can be employed. For example, it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy chain joining region gene in chimeric and germ-line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ-line immunoglobulin gene array in such germ-line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. Human antibodies can also be produced in phage display libraries.</p>Antibodies of the invention are preferably administered to a subject in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Typically, an appropriate amount of a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt is used in the formulation to render the formulation isotonic. Examples of the pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier include saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution. The pH of the solution is preferably from about 5 to about 8, and more preferably from about 7 to about 7.5. Further carriers include sustained release preparations such as semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the antibody, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, liposomes or microparticles. It will be apparent to those persons skilled in the art that certain carriers may be more preferable depending upon, for instance, the route of administration and concentration of antibody being administered.</p>The antibodies can be administered to the subject, patient, or cell by injection (e.g., intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intramuscular), or by other methods such as infusion that ensure its delivery to the bloodstream in an effective form. The antibodies may also be administered by intratumoral or per",
    "age display and in case of practical use as drug, alpha and beta chain can be linked e.g. by non-native disulfide bonds, other covalent bonds (single-chain T-cell receptor), or by dimerization domains (Boulter et al., 2003; Card et al., 2004; Willcox et al., 1999). The T-cell receptor can be linked to toxins, drugs, cytokines (see, for example, US 2013/0115191), and domains recruiting effector cells such as an anti-CD3 domain, etc., in order to execute particular functions on target cells. Moreover, it could be expressed in T cells used for adoptive transfer. Further information can be found in WO 2004/033685A1 and WO 2004/074322A1. A combination of sTCRs is described in WO 2012/056407A1. Further methods for the production are disclosed in WO 2013/057586A1.</p>In addition, the peptides and/or the TCRs or antibodies or other binding molecules of the present invention can be used to verify a pathologist's diagnosis of a cancer based on a biopsied sample.</p>The antibodies or TCRs may also be used for in vivo diagnostic assays. Generally, the antibody is labeled with a radionucleotide (such as <sup>111</sup>1n, <sup>99</sup>Tc, <sup>14</sup>C, <sup>131</sup>I, <sup>3</sup>H, <sup>32</sup>P or <sup>35</sup>S) so that the tumor can be localized using immunoscintiography. In one embodiment, antibodies or fragments thereof bind to the extracellular domains of two or more targets of a protein selected from the group consisting of the above-mentioned proteins, and the affinity value (Kd) is less than 1\u00d710 \u03bcM.</p>Antibodies for diagnostic use may be labeled with probes suitable for detection by various imaging methods. Methods for detection of probes include, but are not limited to, fluorescence, light, confocal and electron microscopy; magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy; fluoroscopy, computed tomography and positron emission tomography. Suitable probes include, but are not limited to, fluorescein, rhodamine, eosin and other fluorophores, radioisotopes, gold, gadolinium and other lanthanides, paramagnetic iron, fluorine-18 and other positron-emitting radionuclides. Additionally, probes may be bi- or multi-functional and be detectable by more than one of the methods listed. These antibodies may be directly or indirectly labeled with said probes. Attachment of probes to the antibodies includes covalent attachment of the probe, incorporation of the probe into the antibody, and the covalent attachment of a chelating compound for binding of probe, amongst others well recognized in the art. For immunohistochemistry, the disease tissue sample may be fresh or frozen or may be embedded in paraffin and fixed with a preservative such as formalin. The fixed or embedded section contains the sample are contacted with a labeled primary antibody and secondary antibody, wherein the antibody is used to detect the expression of the proteins in situ.</p>Another aspect of the present invention includes an in vitro method for producing activated T cells, the method com"
