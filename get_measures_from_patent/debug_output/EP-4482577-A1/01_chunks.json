    "ow cytometry using a fluorescein-labeled Exendin-4 peptide fluorescent probe (FLEX). Cells are harvested in Versene solution and washed 3-times with PBS+0.5% BSA before incubation with FLEX reagent (10 \u00b5M) for 2 hours at room temperature. After incubation, cells are washed 3-times in PBS+0.5% BSA before final resuspension in PBS prior to analysis by flow cytometry to measure FLEX mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) as a measure of GLP-1R expression on the cell surface. [0153] For compound testing in the CHO-K1_hGLP-1Rlow_clone10 cell lines, cells are seeded in 384-well plates (1,000 cells/well). Test compounds are serially diluted in DMSO (10-point, 3-fold dilution), added to wells using an ECHO dispenser (10 nL/well) and plates are centrifuged for 1 min and agitated for 2 min at room temperature prior to 30-minute incubation at 25\u00b0C. After incubation, Eu-cAMP (5 \u00b5L) and Ulight-anti-cAMP (5 \u00b5L) reagents are added to each well, followed by centrifugation for 1 minute, agitation for 2 minutes at room temperature, and final incubation of the plates at 25\u00b0C for 15 minutes. Plates are read using an EnVision microplate reader (excitation=320 nm; emission= 615 and 655 nm). Dose-response curves are generated from duplicate wells based on percent activation calculated relative to a control GLP-1 peptide agonist that was run in parallel. EC<sub>50</sub> values are determined by fitting percent activation as a function of compound concentration using the Hill equation (XLfit). [0154] The EC50 values of exemplary compounds 1 and 2 in the low expression assay are shown in the table below. The EC50 values are compared to Reference Compound A and Reference Compound B. The compounds tested were compound samples prepared according to the General Procedures described in the Examples section. [0155] Metabolic Stability in Hepatocytes [0156] Test compounds are incubated in human hepatocytes and stability is assessed from the substrate depilation approach. Test compounds are dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to create a 10 mM Stock, and then further diluted to create a 1000\u00d7 Working Stock of 1 mM with DMSO in 96-well plates for test compounds and the positive control (midazolam). Vials containing cryopreserved hepatocytes are removed from the liquid nitrogen tank and immediately immersed in a 37\u00b0C water bath. The vials are shaken gently until the contents had thawed and were then immediately emptied into 48 mL of pre-warmed HT Medium in a 50 mL conical tube. Cells remaining in the vial are resuspended with 1.0 mL of \n\npre-warmed HT Medium and added to the conical tube. The tube is capped and then gently inverted several times to resuspend the hepatocytes. The cell suspension is centrifuged at 50 x g at room temperature for 5 minutes and the supernatant discarded. The cell pellet is loosened by gently swirling the centrifuge tube and is re-suspended in 4 mL of warm Dulbecco's Modified Eagle medium (DMEM). Cell density is determined by a cell counter by Nexcelom, and DMEM medium is added to obtain a target density of 1 x 106 cells/mL. The assay is carried out in 96-wel",
    "fter incubation, cells were washed 3-times in PBS+0.5% BSA before final resuspension in PBS prior to analysis by flow cytometry to measure FLEX mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) as a measure of GLP-1R expression on the cell surface. Both cell lines showed higher MFI values relative to control CHO-K1 cells, confirming GLP-1R surface expression; CHO-K1_hGLP-1Rhigh_clone16 cells showed significantly higher MFI levels relative to CHO-K1-hGLP-1low_clone10 cells.
