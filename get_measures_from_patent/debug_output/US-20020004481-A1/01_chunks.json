    " than one day, and typically at least one to two weeks. Furthermore, formulation in aqueous solution of NGF with a metal that binds NGF, such as zinc, prior to encapsulation with biopolymer, surprisingly increased stability of NGF released from these microencapsulated devices Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment, the NGF is formulated with the metal in solution prior to drying or admixture with microencapsulaton polymers or release modifiers. While a few protein drugs have been formulated in a controlled release mode, controlled release at the desired rate and over a desired period is difficult to achieve. For example, it was reported that rhGH can form a complex with zinc and can be stabilized by complexing the protein with zinc acetate during microsphere fabrication process and during subsequent release in vivo (Johnson, et al. Nature Medicine 2:795-799(1996)). However, the conditions used to encapsulate a drug must not result in degradation of the drug to be delivered nor must the drug react with the polymeric matrix so as to inactivate or bind the drug. For a clinical situation, the delivery means must be cost effective to produce, stable to storage, and administrable using standard methodology. These needs have been met by the present invention. </p>[0024] \u201cPolyol\u201d as used herein denotes a hydrocarbon including at least two hydroxyls bonded to carbon atoms. Polyols may include other functional groups. Polyols are preferably of a molecular weight less than about 70,000 kD. Examples of polyols useful for practicing the instant invention include sugar alcohols such as mannitol and trehalose, and polyethers such as polyethylene glycol. See U.S. Pat. No. 5,589,167, issued Dec. 31, 1996, which is incorporated herein by reference. NGF can be stabilized against denaturation when treated with an organic solvent by admixing the polypeptide with a polyol, preferably a sugar alcohol, and more preferably trehalose, mannitol or sucrose, and most preferably trehalose. </p>[0025] \u201cPolyether\u201d as used herein denotes a hydrocarbon containing at least three ether bonds. Polyethers may include other functional groups. Polyethers useful for practicing the invention include polyethylene glycol (PEG). </p>[0026] \u201cDry polypeptide\u201d as used herein denotes a polypeptide which has been subjected to a drying procedure such as lyophilization such that at least 50% of moisture has been removed. </p>[0027] \u201cEncapsulation\u201d as used herein denotes a method for formulating a therapeutic agent such as a polypeptide into a composition (microsphere device) useful for controlled release of the therapeutic agent.

Preferred salts are zinc acetate, zinc carbonate, calcium acetate, and calcium carbonate. The more preferred polyvalent metal salt includes zinc acetate and calcium acetate. </p>[0113] The molar ratio of NGF to metal is that which stabilizes NGF upon release from the microspheres without causing untoward harm or side-effect in a patient or cell culture to which the NGF-microspheres are administered. The in solution molar ratio of NGF to metal ion can range from 1 to 4 to 1 to 50, more preferably 1 to 6 to 1 to 20, even more preferably 1 to 8 to 1 to 14. </p>[0114] If necessary, in order to form a homogeneous NGF/metal complex, any metals occurring in the NGF from purification may be removed from the polypeptide by known methods and replaced with the stabilizing metal of choice. </p>[0115] Optionally present in the NGF and metal salt mixture is an excipient useful to either stabilize NGF against denaturation by organic solvent used in the miroencapsulation process and/or to maximize NGF concentration. Typically the excipicnt will be a polyol of a molecular weight less than about 70,000 kD. Examples of polyols that maybe used include trehalose, mannitol, and polyethylene glycol. Typically, the mass ratio of trehalose to polypeptide will be 100:1 to 1:100, preferably 1:1 to 1:10, more preferably 1:3 to 1:4. Typical mass ratios of mannitol to polypeptide will be 100:1 to 1:100, preferably 1:1 to 1:10, more preferably 1:1 to 1:2. Typically, the mass ratio of PEG to polypeptide will be 100:1 to 1:100, preferably 1:1 to 1:10. Optimal ratios are chosen on the basis of an excipient concentration which allows maximum solubility of polypeptide with minimum denaturation of the polypeptide. </p>[0116] In the present invention, it is preferable that the efficiency of entrapment of NGF into a biodegradable polymer greater than or equal to 50%. More preferably it is greater than or equal to 80% and most preferably it is greater than or equal to 90%. </p>[0117] The concentration of bioactive NGF loaded in the sustained-release preparation in the present invention can range from 0.001 to 50% by weight of the microsphere, about 0.01 to about 30% (w/w) preferred, with 2 to 20 percent more preferred, and 5 to 15% even more preferred. A load of about 10% (w/w) is typical. NGF loading is limited by the solubility of the NGF in water and the volume of aqueous NGF that can be added to the polymer in organic solvent. Volumes of greater than 0.5 mL of NGF per gram of polymer typically result in a large initial burst of drug from the microspheres. To avoid these difficulties, a solid",

Each rhNGF sample was diluted in assay diluent to two target concentrations of 25 and 12.5ng/mL, and each dilution was analyzed in duplicate. The protein concentration in mg/mL was normalized to a \u221270\u00b0 C. internal reference standard which was submitted for the same assay. </p>[0155] PC-12 Cell Survival Bioassay. </p>[0156] This assay determines the ability of rhNGF to bind to its receptors and generate intracellular signals that result in the survival of PC-12 cells under serum-free culture conditions and has a range of 0.24-30 ng/mL. The active protein concentration in mg/mL was normalized to a \u221270\u00b0 C. internal reference standard which was submitted for the same assay. </p>[0157] Neurite Outgrowth Assay. </p>[0158] The biological activity of NGF was determined using the PC12 assay developed by Greene (A quantitative bioassay for nerve growth factor activity employing a clonal pheochromocytoma cell line. Brain Res. 133:350-353 (1977)) and modified as described by Schmelzer et al. (J. Neurochem. 59:1675-1683 (1992)). </p>[0159] SDS-PAGE. </p>[0160] Samples were diluted into Novex tricine SDS sample buffer and incubated for 1 hour at 50\u00b0 C. Non-reduced SDS-PAGE was run on Novex tricine gels containing 10% acrylamide followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Molecular weights were estimated using Bio-Rad low molecular weight markers. Using non-reduced SDS-PAGE the monomer is at 13.5 kDa and dimer band at approximately 26 kD. </p>[0161] Stability of NGF at 37\u00b0 C. was assessed in part by the extent of aggregation of NGF. The dimer/monomer equilibrium constant for murine NGF is smaller than 10-13 M at pH 4-7 (Bothwell et al., J. Biol. Chem. 252:8532-8536 (1977); Timm, et al., Biochem. 33:4667-4676 (1994); Moore et al., Neurobiol. 5:369-381 (1975); Timm et al., Prot. Sci. 1:236-244 (1992)). NGF, therefore, assayed primarily as a dimer in the neutral pH SEC. A small amount of aggregated NGF can be identified as tetramer based on molecular weight standards. A leading shoulder on this peak indicates larger aggregates. </p>[0162] In vitro release of NGF from the microspheres was measured by incubation in release buffer: 10 mM sodium acetate, 136 mM NaCI, 0.02% polysorbate 20, 0.02% sodium azide. pH 5.5. The \u201cinitial release\u201d period was defined as one hour. </p>[0163] Methods </p>[0164] The NGF protein was observed to have the greatest physicochemical stability at pH 5.5 and was therefore formulated in 5 mM histidine, pH 5.5 (De Young, et al., Biophys. J. 66:A401 (1994)). Various excipients were added to this formulation buffer and then the formulations were treated with ethyl acetate as described previously (Cleland, J. L. &amp; Jones, A. J. S. Pharm. Res. 13:1464-1475 (1996)). The most stable of the tested formulations was spray freeze dried by pumping the solution through an ultrasonic nozzle into liquid nitrogen and lyophilizing the frozen droplets.
