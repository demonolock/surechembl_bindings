[0091] In some embodiments of the invention, an anti-complement aptamer modulates a function of a complement component or a variant thereof. In particularly preferred embodiments, an anti-complement aptamer inhibits or decreases a function of the complement component or a variant thereof, preferably in vivo, preferably in a vertebrate, preferably a mammal, more preferably in vivo in humans. In some embodiments of the invention, for example where C2, C3, C4,<sup>'</sup>C5 and/or Factor B is the complement target, the function modulated, preferably inhibited, by the aptamer is complement protein cleavage. In some embodiments of the invention, for example where C2b, C5b, C6, C7, C8, C9, Factor B and/or properdin is the complement target, the function modulated, preferably inhibited, by",
    "drophilicity, lipophilicity, lipophobicity, positive charge, negative charge, neutral charge, zwitterions, polarizability, nuclease-resistance, conformational rigidity, conformational flexibility, protein-binding characteristics, mass etc. Aptamer Medicinal Chemistry schemes may include base-modifications, sugar-modifications or phosphodiester linkage-modifications. [00256] When considering the kinds of substituents that are likely to be beneficial within the context of a therapeutic aptamer, it may be desirable to introduce substitutions that fall into one or more of the following categories:</p>(1) Substituents already present in the body, e.g., 2'-deoxy, 2'-ribo, 2'-O-methyl purines or pyrimidines or 5-methyl cytosine. (2) Substituents already part of an approved therapeutic, e.g., phosphorothioate-linked oligonucleotides. (3) Substituents that hydrolyze or degrade to one of the above two categories, e.g., methylphosphonate-linked oligonucleotides.</p>The aptamers of the present invention include aptamers developed through aptamer medicinal chemistry as described herein. \n\n[002571 Target binding affinity of the aptamers of the present invention can be assessed through a series of binding reactions between the aptamer and target (e.g., a protein) in which trace <sup>32</sup>P-labeled aptamer is incubated with a dilution series of the target in a buffered medium then analyzed by nitrocellulose filtration using a vacuum filtration manifold. Referred to herein as the dot blot binding assay, this method uses a three layer filtration medium consisting (from top to bottom) of nitrocellulose, nylon filter, and gel blot paper. RNA that is bound to the target is captured on the nitrocellulose filter whereas the non-target bound RNA is captured on the nylon filter. The gel blot paper is included as a supporting medium for the other filters. Following filtration, the filter layers are separated, dried and exposed on a phosphor screen and quantified using a phosphorimaging system from which. The quantified results can be used to generate aptamer binding curves from which dissociation constants (K<sub>D</sub>) can be calculated. In a preferred embodiment, the buffered medium used to perform the binding reactions is IX Dulbecco's PBS (with Ca <sup>**</sup> and Mg<sup>+</sup>*) plus 0.1 mg/mL BSA.</p>[00258] Generally, the ability of an aptamer to modulate the functional activity of a target, i.e., the functional activity of the aptamer, can be assessed using in vitro and in vivo models, which will vary depending on the biological function of the target. In some embodiments, the aptamers of the present invention may inhibit a known biological function of the target, while in other embodiments the aptamers of the invention may stimulate a known biological function of the target. . The functional activity of aptamers of the present invention can be assessed using in vitro and in vivo models designed to measure a known function of a complement component target.<",

    "d not limitation of the claims that follow.</p>EXAMPLE 1</p>Anti-C5 Aptamer Activity in the Classical and Alternative Complement Pathways</p>Example IA: Hemolysis Assay.</p>100435] The CH50 test measures the ability of the complement system in a serum test sample to lyse 50% of cells in a standardized suspension of antibody-coated sheep erythrocytes. A solution of 0.2% human serum was mixed with antibody-coated sheep erythrocytes (Diamedix EZ Complement CH50 Kit, Diamedix Corp., Miami, FL) in the presence or absence of various anti-C5 aptamers. The assay was run according to the kit protocol in veronal-buffered saline containing calcium, magnesium and 1% gelatin (GVB<sup>4+</sup> complement buffer) and incubated for 30 minutes at 37<sup>0</sup>C. After incubation, the samples were centrifuged to pellet intact erythrocytes. The optical density at 412 nm (OD412) of the supernatant was read to quantify the release of soluble hemoglobin, which is proportional to the extent of hemolysis (Green et al. , (1995) Chem. Biol. 2:683-95). To verify that the aptamers blocked C5 activation, some hemolysis supernatants were analyzed for the presence of C5a and C5b-9 by ELISA (C5b-9 ELISA kit, Quidel, San Diego, CA; C5a ELISA kit, BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) following the ELISA kit protocols. \n\n[00436] The addition of a non-PEGylated anti-C5 aptamer (ARC186) (SEQ ID NO: 4) to the reaction mixture inhibited hemolysis in a dose-dependent manner, as shown in the graph of Figure 7 A, with an IC50 of 0.5 \u00b1 0.1 nM, (see Figure 7B), a value that is consistent with the K<sub>D</sub> determined by nitrocellulose filtration. At very high aptamer concentrations (&gt;10 nM), the extent of hemolysis was essentially indistinguishable from background (no serum added), indicating that ARC 186 (SEQ ID NO: 4) was able to completely block complement activity. Conjugation of the ARC186 (SEQ ID NO: 4) aptamer with 20 IeDa (ARC657; SEQ ID NO: 61), 30 kDa (ARC658; SEQ ID NO: 62), branched 40 kDa (l,3-bis(mPEG-[20 kDa])-propyl-2-(4'- butamide) (ARC187; SEQ ID NO: 5), branched 40 kDa (2,3-bis(mPEG-[20 kDa])-propyl-l- carbamoyl) (ARC1905; SEQ ID NO: 67), linear 40 kDa (ARC1537; SEQ ID NO: 65), and linear 2x20 kDa (ARC 1730; SEQ ID NO: 66) PEG groups had little effect on the aptamer inhibitory activity in the CH50 hemolysis assay (Figure 7A-Figure 7D).</p>[00437] In an additional study, the inhibitory activity of the PEGylated anti-C5 aptamer ARC1905 (branched 40 kDa (2,3-bis(mPEG-[20 kDa])-propyl-l -carbamoyl); SEQ ID NO: 67) was compared to its non-PEGylated precursor, ARC672 (SEQ ID NO: 63) which contains a terminal 5'-amine, in the CH50 hemolysis assay described above. A solution of human serum (Innovative Research, Southfield, MI) was mixed with antibody-coated sheep erythrocytes (Diamedix EZ Complement CH50 Kit, Diamedix Corp., Miami, FL) in the presence or absence of various concentrations of ARC 1905 and ARC627 respsectively such that the final concentration of serum in each assay was 0.1%, and the assay was run according to manufacturer's recommended protocol. The hemolysis reactions were incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0 C with agitation to ensure that cells remained in suspension. At the end of the incubation, intact cells were pelleted by centrifugation (2000 rpm, 2 min, room temperature), 200 \u03bcL supernatant was transferred to a flat-bottomed polystyrene plate (VWR, cat#62409-003). The optical density at 415 nm (OD415) of the supernatant was read to quantify the release of soluble hemoglobin. The % inhibition at each aptamer concentration measured was calculated using the equation %inh = 100 - 100 X (A<sub>samp</sub>i<sub>e</sub> - A<sub>no</sub> semm) / (A<sub>no</sub> aptamer - A<sub>no</sub> serum), where A<sub>sam</sub>pie is the sample absorbance at varying concentrations of aptamer, A<sub>no</sub> seru<sub>m</sub> is the absorbance due to background hemolysis in the absence of serum (100% inhibition control) and A<sub>noaptamer</sub> is the absorbance due to basal complement activity in the absence of aptamer (0% inhibition control). IC5<sub>0</sub> values were determined from a plot of % inhibition versus [inhibitor] using the equation \n\n%inh \n\n * [inhibitor]\" / (IC<sub>50</sub>\" + [inhibitor]\") + background. IC<sub>9</sub>O and IC<sub>99</sub> values were calculated from IC50 values using the equations IC90 = IC50 x [9O/(100-90]<sup>1/n</sup> and IC90 = IC<sub>50</sub> x [99/(100-99] <sup>Un</sup>. The IC<sub>50</sub> values for ARC1905 and ARC627 in this parallel study were 0.648 +/- 0.0521 and 0.913 +/- 0.0679 respectively (see also Figure 58) further confirming that PEGylation had little, if any, effect on aptamer function.</p>[00438] ELISA analysis of hemolysis supernatants indicated that this functional inhibition correlated with blockade of C5a release. Thus, the hemolysis data show that ARCl 86 (SEQ ID NO: 4), and its PEGylated conjugates, are highly potent complement inhibitors that function by blocking the convertase-catalyzed activation of C5. [00439] Hemolysis assays with non-PEGylated material indicated that the anti-C5 aptamer does not cross-react with C5 from a number of non-primate species, including rat, guinea pig, dog and pig. However, significant inhibitory activity was observed in screens of primate serum, including serum from cynomolgus macaque, rhesus macaque and chimpanzee. The in vitro efficacy of the anti-C5 aptamer was further investigated in cynomolgus serum using ARC658 (SEQ TD NO: 62), the 30 kDa-PEG analogue of ARC186 (SEQ ID NO: 4). In a side-by-side comparison (n = 3), ARC658 inhibited human complement activity with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.21 \u00b1 0.0 nM and cynomolgus complement activity with an IC50 of 1.7 \u00b1 0.4 nM (Figure 8). Thus ARC658 (SEQ ID NO: 62) is 8 \u00b1 3 fold less potent in cynomolgus serum compared to human by this measure. [00440] In a related study, the effects of the branched 40 kDa (2,3-bis(mPEG-[20 kDa])- propyl-1 -carbamoyl) PEGylated anti-C5 aptamer, ARC 1905 (SEQ ID NO: 67) on classical complement pathway activation as assayed by sheep erythrocyte hemolysis was investigated in the presence of human (Innovative Research, Southfield, MT), cynomolgus monkey (Bioreclamation, Hicksville, NY), or rat serum (Bioreclamation, Hicksville, NY). These assays were performed in highly diluted serum, 0.1% for human and cynomolgus monkey, and 0.3% for rat, under the same conditions as those used to compare the inhibitory effects of ARC 1905 against ARC672 on sheep erythrocyte hemolysis as described directly above. In a side by side comparison, complete inhibition (90-99%) of in vitro complement activity was achievable with ARCl 905 in both human and cynomolgus monkey sera whereas ARC 1905 displayed little to no specific inhibitory activity in the rat complement sample (Figure 59A). Similar to ARC658, \n\nARC 1905 was ~ 10-fold less potent against cynomolgus complement activity under the conditions of the assay, as reflected in the IC<sub>90</sub> and IC<sub>99</sub> values reported in Figure 59B.</p>[00441] Nitrocellulose Filter Binding Assays. Individual aptamers were <sup>32</sup>P-labeled at the 5' end by incubation with 7-<sup>32</sup>P-ATP and polynucleotide ki",
    "MgCfe at room temperature (23\u00b0C) and 37\u00b0C, for 15 min and 4 hr time intervals. The binding reactions were analyzed by nitrocellulose filtration using a Minifold I dot-blot, 96-well vacuum filtration manifold (Schleicher &amp; Schuell, Keene, NH). A three-layer filtration medium was used, consisting (from top to bottom) of Protran nitrocellolose (Schleicher &amp; Schuell), Hybond-P nylon (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) and GB002 gel blot paper (Schleicher &amp; Schuell). The nitrocellulose layer, which selectively binds protein over nucleic acid, preferentially retained the anti-C5 aptamer in complex with a protein ligand, while non- complexed anti-C5 aptamer passed through the nitrocellulose and adhered to the nylon. The gel blot paper was included simply as a supporting medium for the other filters. Following filtration, the filter layers were separated, dried and exposed on a phosphor screen (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified using a Storm 860 Phosphorimager<sup>\u00ae</sup> blot imaging system (Amersham Biosciences).</p>[00442] As shown in shown in Figure 9 and Figure 10, increasing C5 concentrations enhance the proportion of ARC 186 captured on the nitrocellulose membrane. The dependence of bound ARC 186 on increasing C5 concentrations is well-described by a single-site binding model (C5 + ARCl 86 <sub>*</sub>\u2192 C5-ARC186; % bound = C<sub>13x</sub> / (1 + K<sub>D</sub> / [C5]); C<sub>m</sub>a<sub>x</sub> is the maximum % bound at saturating [C5]; K<sub>D</sub> is the dissociation constant). ARCl 86 binding curves at two temperatures following either a 15 min or a 4 hr incubation are shown in Figures 9 and 10, respectively. Following a 15 min incubation, the ARC 186 binding curves at 23 and 37\u00b0C are essentially indistinguishable within error, fitting with K<sub>D</sub> values of 0.5 - 0.6 nM (Figure 9). Differences between binding curves at 23 and 37\u00b0C become more pronounced when the incubation time is extended. Following a 4 hr incubation (Figure 10), the K<sub>D</sub> observed at 23 \u00b0C decreases to 0.08 \u00b1</p>0.01 nM, while the K<sub>D</sub> observed at 37\u00b0C remains unchanged (0.6 \u00b1 0.1 nM). \n\n[00443] To demonstrate the basis for the long incubation requirement at room temperature, the affinity at this temperature was further explored using kinetic methods. The rate of the reverse reaction describing the dissociation of C5\u00bbARC186 is v<sub>rev</sub> = A:-;[C5\u00bbARC186], where v<sub>rev</sub> is the rate (units of M min<sup>\"1</sup>) and k-j is the first order dissociation rate constant (units of min<sup>\"</sup> '). The rate of the forward reaction describing the formation of the C5\u00bbARC186 complex is V<sub>for</sub> = &amp;/[C5][ARC186], where V<sub>for</sub> is the rate (units of M min<sup>\"1</sup>) and kj is the second order association rate constant (units of M^min<sup>\"1</sup>). The data were analyzed using the pseudo-first order assumption, where the concentration of one reactant (C5 in this case) is held in vast excess over the other ([",
    "*-<sup>#/</sup> (see Figure 11). The value of the dissociation rate constant, k./, determined by this method is 0.013 \u00b1 0.02 min<sup>\"1</sup>, corresponding to a half-life (ti/<sub>2</sub> = h\u03c42 / fc.f) of 53 \u00b1 8 min.</p>[00445] To analyze the association reaction, the equilibration rate constant (k<sub>e</sub>g) for the formation of C5\u00bbARC186 was measured in the presence of varying concentrations of C5 protein (1 - 5 nM). Complex formation was initiated by mixing together C5 protein and radiolabeled ARC 186 in PBS containing 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> at room temperature (23\u00b0C), and stopped by nitrocellulose filtration partitioning. As described for the dissociation reactions, a timecourse of complex formation was obtained by varying the duration between the initiation of the reaction and filtration. The timecourse of equilibration, observed as an increase in the percentage of radiolabeled ARCl 86 captured on the nitrocellulose filter, is well described by a single- \n\nexponential decay where % ARCl 86 bound = 100 X (1 - \u20ac<sup>k&gt;t</sup>). The timecourses of equilibration for 1, 2 and 4 nM C5 are displayed in Figure 12. As expected, the value of k<sub>eq</sub> increases linearly with [C5] (keg (1 nM) = 0.19 \u00b1 0.02 min<sup>'1</sup>; A^ (2 nM) = 0.39 \u00b1 0.03 min<sup>\"1</sup>; fc, (3 nM) = 0.59 \u00b1 0.05 min<sup>\"1</sup>; k^ (4 nM) = 0.77 \u00b1 0.06 min<sup>\"1</sup>; k^ (5 nM) = 0.88 \u00b1 0.06 min<sup>\"1</sup>). Under the conditions of the experiment, the relationship between k<sub>eq</sub>, ki and k.i is keq = kj[C5] + Lj. Thus, an estimate of ki is derived from the slope of a plot of k<sub>eq</sub> versus [C5] (see Figure 12 inset), in this case 0.18 \u00b1 0.01 nM<sup>\"1</sup>min<sup>\"1</sup>.</p>[00446] These data indicate that, under conditions of low C5 concentration (e.g., 0.1 nM), an extended incubation is required in order for the mixture of C5 and radiolabeled ARC 186 to reach equilibrium. Under these conditions, k<sub>eq</sub> = (0.18 \u00b1 0.01 nM<sup>\"</sup> Wn<sup>\"1</sup>) (0.1 nM) + 0.013 min<sup>\"1</sup> = 0.03 min<sup>*1</sup>, corresponding to a half-life of 22 min. Thus, nearly 2 hours of room temperature incubation (~ 5 half-lives) are required for complete (&gt; 95%) equilibration. A short incubation time (e.g., 15 min) will significantly underestimate the actual affinity of the complex, as shown above by the difference in affinities observed for a 15 min (K<sub>D</sub> = 0.5 nM) versus a 4 hour (K<sub>D</sub> = 0.08 nM) incubation. An alternative estimate of the room temperature K<sub>D</sub> can be calculated from the kinetic data according to the relationship K<sub>D</sub> \u2014 k.j l k\u03b9. In this case, the calculated K<sub>D</sub> is 0.07 \u00b1 0.01 nM, which is completely consistent with the K<sub>D</sub> determined above by thermodynamic methods.</p>[00447] The specificity of ARCl 86 (SEQ ID NO: 4) for C5 was also assessed in nitrocellulose filtration assays by comparison with complement components both upstream and downstream from C5 in the complement cascade. Purified human proteins and protein complexes were purchased from Complement Technologies (Tyler, TX) including: CIq (cat. # A099.18; 2.3 \u03bcM), C3 (cat. # Al 13c.8; 27 \u03bcM), C5 (cat. # A120.14; 5.4 \u03bcM), C5a des Arg (cat. # A145.6; 60 \u03bcM), sC5b-9 (cat. # A127.6; 1 \u03bcM), factor B (cat. # A135.12; 11 \u03bcM) and factor H (cat. # Al 37.13P; 6.8 \u03bcM). Binding reactions were established by performing serial dilutions of protein in PBS plus 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.02 mg/mL BSA and 0.002 mg/mL tRNA, incubating for 1-4 hours at 25\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C, and then applied to the nitrocellulose filtration apparatus as described above. Dissociation constants KD were determined from semi-log plots of of % nitrocellulose binding versus [C5] by a fit of the data to the equation: % nitrocellulose binding = amplitude X [C5] /( K<sub>D</sub> + [CS]). \n\n[00448] The results depicted in Figure 13 show the aptamer essentially does not recognize C5a (K<sub>D</sub> \u00bb 3 \u03bcM), although it does display weak affinity for soluble C5b-9 (K<sub>D</sub> &gt; 0.2 \u03bcM), presumably due to interactions with the C5b component. Other complement components display moderate to weak affinity for the aptamer. Non-activated C3 essentially does not bind to the aptamer; however, factor H (K<sub>D</sub> ~ 100 nM) and, to a much lesser extent, CIq (K<sub>D</sub> &gt; 0.3 \u03bcM) do bind. Taken together, the data indicate that ARCl 86 (SEQ ID NO: 4) binds with high affinity to human C5, mainly via recognition of the C5b domain. Thus, ARCl 86 and its PEGylated derivatives e.g., ARC 1905 should not interfere with generation of C3b, which is important for bacterial opsonization, or with innate control of C activation by regulatory factors. [00449] Conjugation of aptamers with high molecular weight PEG moieties introduces the possibility of steric hindrance leading to reduced affinity. PEG-modified aptamers are not readily evaluated for direct binding by nitrocellulose filtration assays due to the tendency of these aptamers to adhere to nitrocellulose even in the absence of target protein. However, the relative affinities of these aptamers can be assessed from their comparative ability to compete with radiolabeled, non-PEGylated aptamer (&lt; 10 pM) for binding to target as measured by nitrocellulose filtration known as a competition binding assay, run at 37\"C. As the concentration of cold (i.e., non-radiolabeled) competitor increases, the percent of radiolabeled aptamer bound to target protein decreases. As shown in Figure 14, increasing concentrations of cold ARCl 86 (SEQ ID NO: 4) or PEGylated aptamer (ARC657 (SEQ ID NO: 61), ARC658 (SEQ ID NO: 62), and ARC187 (SEQ ID NO: 5) (0.05 - 1000 nM) readily compete with radiolabeled ARC186 (SEQ ID NO: 4) for binding in the presence of 2 nM C5 protein. Additionally, the titration curves for all four aptamers nearly overlap, indicating that PEG-conjugation in the case of ARC657, ARC658 and ARC187 has little or no effect on the affinity of the aptamer for C5.</p>[00450] In a similar study, the effect of PEG conjugation on binding to C5 was tested by comparing ARC672 (ARC 186 with a 5 '-terminal amine; SEQ ID NO: 63) with ARC 1905</p>(ARC627 conjugatged with a branched 40 kDa (2,3-bis(mPEG-[20 kDa])-pro\u03c1yl-l -carbamoyl) PEG) using the competition binding assay. 10 \u03bcM stocks of each aptamer were prepared in PBS plus 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.01 mg/mL BSA, 0.002 mg/mL tRNA, and serially diluted to generate a 1OX sample series covering a &gt;100-fold range of aptamer concentration. 12 \u03bcL aliquots of each sample were then added in a 96-well plate to 96 \u03bcL <sup>32</sup>P-radiolabeled ARC 186 to generate a 1.1 X \n\n solution of label and cold competitor. 90 \u03bcL of label/competitor solution was then added to 10 \u03bcL of 1OX C5 protein to initiate the reactions. The final concentration of radiolabeled ARCl 86 in each reaction was held constant. Binding reactions were equilibrated for 15 \u2014 30 min at 37\u00b0C, and then filtered onto nitrocellulose filter apparatus described above. For the purposes of data 5 analysis, cold competitor aptamers were treated as competitive inhibitors of the ARC186/C5 interaction; % inhibition was calculated by normalizing the data to control reactions lacking competitor (0% inhibition control). IC50 values were determined from semi-log plots of % inhibition versus [ARC672] or [ARC1905] by a fit of the data to the equation: % inhibition = amplitude X [competitor]\" /(ICso\" + [competitor]\").</p>10 [00451] As shown in Figure 60, the addition of a branched 40 kDa (2,3-bis(mPEG-[20 kDa])- propyl-1 -carbamoyl) PEG had little or no effect on aptamer affinity as measured by competitive binding. K<sub>D</sub> values of 0.46+/- 0.149 nM and 0.71 +/- 0.130 nM were approximated for ARC672 and ARC 1905 respectively by the y-intercept of the line fit to the ICso versus C5 data in Figure 60. Both values are close to the K<sub>D</sub> determined for ARC186 at 37\u00b0C.</p>15 [00452] The temperature dependence of the interaction between ARC 1905 and C5 was also estimated by competition assay. ARC 1905 was serially diluted to generate 1OX sample series as described above. Binding reactions were equilibrated for 1 \u2014 4 hours at 25\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C, and then . filtered onto the nitrocellulose filter apparatus. Percent inhibition was calculated by normalizing the data to control reactions lacking competitor (0% inhibition control) or lacking C5 protein</p>20 (100% inhibition control). IC<sub>50</sub> values were determined from semi-log plots of % inhibition versus [ARC672] or [ARC1905] by a fit of the data to the equation: % inhibition = amplitude x [competitor]\" /(IC50\" + [competitor]\"). As shown in Figure 61 ARC1905 binds to C5 with high affinity at both 25\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C. K<sub>D</sub> values of 0.15 \u00b1 0.048 nM and 0.69 \u00b1 0.148 nM were obtained at 25\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C, respectively, from the y-intercept of the IC50 versus C5 data. Both</p>25 values are consistent with the K<sub>D</sub> values determined for the ARC186/C5 interaction described above.</p>Example IB: Whole Blood Assay.</p>[00453] The effect of the anti-C5 aptamer on the alternative pathway of the complement system was analyzed using the following whole blood assay. In the absence of an anticoagulant, 30 blood was drawn from normal human volunteers. Aliquots of blood (containing no anti-</p>138</p>L J O \n\ncoagulant) were incubated with increasing concentrations of ARC186 (SEQ ID NO: 4) for 5 hours at room temperature or 37 C. Samples were centrifuged to isolate serum and the presence of C5b in the serum was detected by sC5b-9 ELISA (C5b-9 ELISA kit. Quidel, San Diego, CA). As shown in Figure 15, the anti-complement activity, as reflected in production of C5b-9, between samples incubated at different temperatures diverged at 3 uM. The room temperature data indicated that the concentration of aptamer required for quantitative inhibition is in the range of 3-6 \u03bcM, whereas the reported concentration of C5 is approximately 400 nM. These results suggest that greater than 10-fold molar excess of anti-C5 aptamer (ARCl 86; SEQ ID NO: 4) may be required for complete inhibition of C5 activity. Example 1C: Complement activation by zymosan.</p>[00454] Zymosan is a polysaccharide component of the yeast cell wall, and a potent activator of the alternative complement cascade.

    " of 450 nm (A450) using a VersaMax UV/vis absorbance plate reader (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The A<sub>4</sub>50 varied with C5a concentration from a low of 0.1 \u2014 0.2 at low C5a, plateauing \u20143.5 at high C5a. For the purposes of quantifying C5a in assay samples, the upper and lower limits of quantification were, respectively, 25 and 0.78 ng/mL hC5a for human, and 15 and 0.94 ng/mL hC5a eq for cynomolgus monkey. A<sub>45</sub>0 versus ng/mL hC5a or hC5a eq was plotted as shown in Figure 62, and a standard curve was obtained from a 4-parameter fit to the data using the equation y = ((A - D)/(l + (x/C)<sup>B</sup>)) + D.</p>[00459] Just prior to C5a analysis, assay samples (including the saline-only and no-zymosan controls) were pre-treated with protein-precipitating reagent as directed in the ELISA kit protocol, then serially diluted in 0.9% saline. C5a levels in undiluted assay samples (including some of the no-zymosan controls) typically exceeded the upper limit of quantitation (ULOQ). Therefore, dilutions of 1/5, 1/50 and 1/250 were tested to accommodate the full range of assay sample C5a concentrations. C5a levels were quantified by comparison with the appropriate (human or cynomolgus monkey) standard curve and corrected for dilution. The % inhibition at each aptanier concentration was calculated using the equation %inh. = 100 - 100 x (C5a<sub>samp</sub>i<sub>e</sub> - \n\nC5ano-zymosan) / (C5as<sub>a</sub>]i<sub>n</sub>e-oniy - C5an<sub>O</sub>-zymo<sub>S</sub>an). IC50 values were determined from a plot of % inhibition versus [ARC 1905] using the equation %inh = (% inhOmaximum X [ARC 1905]\" / (IC<sub>5</sub>o\" + [ARC 1905]\") + background. IC<sub>90</sub> and IC<sub>99</sub> values were calculated from IC50 values using the equations IC90 = IC50 X [90/(100-90]\"\" and IC<sub>99</sub> = IC<sub>50</sub> X [99/(100-99] <sup>1/n</sup>. [00460] The extent of C3 activation (the step in the common complement pathway just upstream of C5) was determined from the relative levels of C3a generated in each zymosan- activated sample, as measured by C3a ELISA (Becton-Dickinson OptiEIA C3a ELISA kit, cat. no. 550499, Franklin Lakes, NJ) following the C3a ELISA kit protocol.</p>[00461] Just prior to C3a analysis, samples (including the saline-only and no-zymosan controls) were serially diluted in 0.9% saline. The C3a ELISA is more sensitive than that for C5a; therefore, dilutions of 1/500, 1/5000 and 1/25,000 were necessary to accommodate the full range of sample C3a concentrations. Kit standards, derived from human serum, were used instead of the custom standards prepared for C5a analysis. Since C3a levels did not vary greatly, the human-specific standards provided a sufficient indication of their relative levels. [00462] The data generated from both the C5a and C3 ELISAs were analyzed using Microsoft Excel, and the mean % inhibition values were plotted using Kaleidagraph (v. 3.51, Synergy Software). ICso, IC<sub>9</sub>0 and IC<sub>9</sub>9 values were determined using the XLfIt 4.1 plug-in to Excel. The comparative effects of ARCl 905 on human and cynomolgus monkey complement activation, as measured by this approach, are summarized in Figure 63 and Figure 64. As can be seen from these Figures, complete inhibition of C5 activati",
    "f sample was transferred to a 15 mL conical tube (Corning, (Corning, NY), cat. # 430766) containing 100 \u03bcL of 0.5M EDTA, giving a final EDTA concentration of 10 mM. 1 mL of plasma supernatant was collected from each quenched sample following centrifugation (Eppendorf Centrifuge 5804) at 4\u00b0C (3,300 rpm, 20 minutes). Supematants were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 20<sup>0</sup>C. To control for background activation, a pre-CPB sample was prepared by adding 5 mL of \n\nfresh blood directly to a 15 mL conical tube on ice containing 100 \u03bcL 0.5M EDTA. This sample was processed for plasma and stored as described above.</p>[00468] The extent of C5 activation was determined from the relative levels of C5a generated in each activated sample, as measured by C5a ELISA as described immediately above. The C5a ELISA was performed on undiluted plasma samples according the ELISA kit protocol and sample C5a levels were quantified by comparison with the C5a standards provided by the manufacturer. The % inhibition of C5a generation at each aptamer concentration was calculated using the equation %inh = 100 - 100 X (C5a<sub>samp</sub>]<sub>e</sub> - C5a<sub>pre</sub>-CPB) / \n\n - C5a<sub>pre</sub>-CPB). IC<sub>50</sub> values were determined from a plot of % inhibition versus [ARC19O5] using the equation %inh = (% inhOma<sub>x</sub>imu\u03c0, x [ARC1905]<sup>n</sup> / (IC<sub>50</sub>\" + [ARC1905]<sup>n</sup>) + background. IC<sub>90</sub> and IC<sub>99</sub> values were calculated from IC50 values using the equations IC<sub>9O</sub> = IC50 * [90/(100-90] <sup>1\u039bl</sup> and IC<sub>99</sub> = IC<sub>50</sub> x [99/(100-99]<sup>1/n</sup>.</p>[00469] The extent of C3 activation was determined from the relative levels of C3a generated in each activated sample, as measured by C3a ELISA as described immediately above. Just prior to C3a analysis, samples (including the saline-only and pre-CPB controls) were serially diluted in 0.9% saline. The C3a ELISA is more sensitive than that for C5a; therefore, a dilution of 1/5000 was necessary to accommodate the range of sample C3a concentrations. Sample C3a levels were quantified by comparison to kit standards, and % inhibition was calculated as described for C5a. The data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel, and the mean % inhibition values were plotted using Kaleidagraph (v3.5 Synergy Software). IC50, IC<sub>90</sub> and IC<sub>99</sub> values were determined using the XLf\u03cat 4.1 plug-in to Excel.</p>[00470] The mean effects of ARC1905 and irrelevant aptamer, ARC127, on complement activation in the five donors is summarized in Figure 66. As shown in Figure 67 complete blockade of C5 activation, as reflected in the generation of C5a, was achieved with &lt;500 nM ARC 1905, while the irrelevant aptamer had no inhibitory effect up to 1 \u03bcM. The mean whole blood IC<sub>50</sub>, IC<sub>90</sub> and IC<sub>99</sub> values were 119 \u00b1 28.6 nM, 268 \u00b1 39.2 nM and 694 \u00b1 241 nM, respectively (Figure 66). While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is reasonable to assume that ARC 1905 is excluded from the cellular blood volume, which comprises approximately 45% of the total. The IC<sub>50</sub>, IC<sub>90</sub> and IC<sub>99</sub> values, adjusted to reflect C5 inhibition in plasma, therefore, were 216 \u00b1 52.0 nM, 487 \u00b1 71 nM and 1261 \u00b1 438 nM. These values are consistent with the \n\nparameters calculated for ARC1905 inhibition of zymosan-induced complement activation in serum suggesting that cellular blood components do not interfere significantly with ARCl 905 anti-C5 activity. C3a generation was not inhibited by ARC 1905 or irrelevant aptamer up to 1 uM. While not wishing to be bound by theory, this suggests that ARC 1905 neither inhibits the C3 convertase reaction, nor blocks other steps that contribute to alternate cascade activation such as C3 deposition and convertase assembl",
    "e selection step. The pool RNA was then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature and the RNA bound to the immobilized C5 was reverse transcribed directly in the selection plate by the addition of RT mix (3' primer,SEQ ID NO:72 and Thermoscript RT, Invitrogen) followed by incubation at 65 <sup>0</sup>C for 1 hour. The resulting cDNA was used as a template for PCR (Taq polymerase, New England Biolabs). Amplified pool template DNA was desalted with a Centrisep column (Princeton Separations) according to the manufacturer's recommended \n\nconditions and used to program transcription of the pool RNA for the next round of selection. The transcribed pool was gel purified on a 10 % polyacrylamide gel every round.</p>[00476] The selection progress was monitored using a sandwich filter binding (dot blot) assay. The 5'- <sup>32</sup>P-labeled pool RNA (trace concentration) was incubated with C5, IX DPBS plus 0.1 mg/mL tRNA and 0.1 mg/mL salmon sperm DNA, for 30 minutes at room temperature, and then applied to a nitrocellulose and nylon filter sandwich in a dot blot apparatus (Schleicher and Schuell). The percentage of pool RNA bound to the nitrocellulose was calculated and monitored approximately every 3 rounds with a single point screen (+/-300 nM C5). Pool K^ measurements were measured using a titration of protein and the dot blot apparatus as described above. [00477] Selection data: Both selections were enriched after 10 rounds over the na\u03cave pool. See Figure 18. At round 10, the pool Kd was approximately 115 nM for the full length and 150 nM for the trypsmized selection, but the extent of binding was only about 10% at the plateau in both. The RlO pools were cloned using TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced.</p>[00478] Sequence Information: 45 clones from each pool were sequenced. RlO full length pool was dominated by one single clone ARC913 (SEQ ID NO: 75) which made up 24% of the pool, 2 sets of duplicates and single sequences made up the remainder. The RlO trypsinized pool contained 8 copies of the same sequence ARC913 (SEQ ID NO: 75), but the pool was dominated by another sequence (AMX221.A7; 46%). The clone ARC913 (SEQ ID NO: 75) had a K<sub>&lt;</sub>j about 140 nM and the extent of binding went to 20 %. See Figure 19.

In the assay of hemolytic inhibition, a solution of 0.2% whole human serum was mixed with antibody-coated sheep erythrocytes (Diamedix EZ Complement CH50 Test, Diamedix Corporation, Miami, FL) in the presence of titrated ARC913 (SEQ ID NO: 75). The assay was run in veronal-buffered saline containing calcium, magnesium and 1% gelatin (GVB<sup>+</sup>* complement buffer) and incubated for lhr at 25 <sup>0</sup>C. After incubation the samples were centrifuged. The optical density at 415 nm (OD<sub>41</sub>S) of the supernatant was read. The inhibition of hemolysis activity is expressed as % hemolysis activity compared to control. See Figure 20. The ICso of the aptamer was calculated to be about 30 nM.</p>EXAMPLE 3 Composition and Sequence Optimization</p>Example 3 A: Minimization of ARC913:</p>[00482] Six constructs based on ARC913 (SEQ ID NO: 75) were transcribed, gel purified, and tested in dot blots for binding to C5. ARC954 was similar to the parent clone with a Kj of 130 nM and extent of binding at 20%, while ARC874 (SEQ ID NO: 76) was the only other clone that bound to C5 with a Kd of 1 uM.</p>[00483] The individual sequences listed in Table 4 are listed in the 5' to 3' direction and were derived from aptamers that were selected under the dRmY SELEX conditions provided.

Doped reselections are used to explore the sequence requirements within an active clone or minimer. Selections are carried out with a synthetic, degenerate pool that has been designed based on a single sequence. The level of degeneracy usually varies from 70% to 85% wild type nucleotide. In general, neutral mutations are observed but in some cases sequence changes can result in improvements in affinity. The composite sequence information can then be used to identify the minimal binding motif and aid in optimization efforts.</p>[00486] Pool preparation: The template sequence taatacgactcactataGGGAGAGGAGAGAACGTTCTACN(30)GTTACGACTAGCATCGATG (SEQ ID NO: 82) was based on ARC913 (SEQ ID NO: 75) and was synthesized with each residue originating from the random region doped at a 15% level, i.e. at each random (\"N\") position, the residue has a 85% chance of being the nucleotide found in the wild type sequence CTTGGTTTGGCACAGGCATACATACGCAGGGGTCGATCG (SEQ ID NO: 83) and a 15% chance of being one of the other three nucleotides. \n\n[00487] The template and RNA pool for the doped reselection were prepared essentially as described above. The templates were amplified with the primers taatacgactcactataGGGAGAGGAGAGAACGTTCTAC (SEQ ID NO: 84) and CATCGATGCTAGTCGTAAC (SEQ ID NO: 85). Two selections were done with full length C5, one selection using a higher concentration of salt in the wash step. The selection protocol was carried out as described above, with two exceptions: 1) Round 1 was done on hydrophobic plates (as well as all subsequent rounds) with only a positive step; and 2) no competitor was used at all during the selection. The C5 concentration and RNA pool concentration were kept constant at 200 nM and IuM respectively. [00488] Doped reselection data. Both the normal and high salt selections were enriched after 5 rounds over the na\u03cave pool. At round 5 the pool Kd was approximately 165 nM for the high salt selection and 175 nM for the normal salt selection. The extent of binding was about 20% at the plateau in both. The R4 pools were cloned using TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and 48 clones from each pool were sequenced. 12 clones from each pool were transcribed and assayed in a single point dot blot assay at 500 nM C5. Dissociation constants</p>(K<sub>&lt;</sub>js) were again measured using the dot blot assay previously described. IQs were estimated for the 11 best clones identified in the single point screen, by fitting the data to the equation: fraction RNA bound = amplitude*!^/^ + [C5]). The clones with the three best Kas were SEQ ID NO: 91 (73 nM), SEQ ID NO: 96 (84 nM) and SEQ ID NO: 95 (92 nM). The sequences for these 11 clones are listed below in Table 5.</p>[00489] The sequences listed in Table 5 are listed in the 5' to 3' direction and represent the nucleotide sequences of the aptamers that were selected under the dRmY SELEX conditions provided.
