    "atively as a powder mix with a suitable carrier for administration using a suitable delivery device.</p>\n  The compositions may contain from 0.1% upwards, e.g. 0.1 - 99% of the active material, depending on the method of administration. A proposed dose of the compounds of the invention is 0.05 mg/kg to about 400 mg/kg bodyweight per day e.g. 0.05mg/kg to 5mg/kg per day. It will be appreciated that it may be necessary to make routine variations to the dosage, depending on the age and condition of the patient and the precise dosage will be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or veterinarian. The dosage will also depend on the route of administration and the particular compound selected.</p>\n  The compounds of formula (I) may, if desired, be administered with one or more therapeutic agents and formulated for administration by any convenient route in a conventional manner. Appropriate doses will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art. For example, the compounds of formula (I) may be administered in combination with a systematic anti-inflammatory corticosteroid such as methyl prednisolone or dexamethasone, or a 5HT3 antagonist such as ondansetron, granisetron or metoclopramide. Antagonists of tachykinins, including substance P and other neurokinins, for example, the compounds of formula (I), may also be administered in combination with sympathomimetics such as ephedrine, pseudoephedrine and oxymetazoline. Compounds which are specific antagonists at Ki receptors, such as the compounds of formula (I), may be administered in combination with compounds which are specific antagonists at NK receptors.</p>\n  Compounds of formula (I), and salts and solvates thereof, may be prepared by the general methods outlined hereinafter. In the following description, the groups R<sup>1</sup>. R<sup>2</sup>, R<sup>3</sup>, R<sup>4</sup> and R<sup>5</sup> and x are as previously defined for compounds of formula (I) unless otherwise stated. \n\nAccording to a first general process (A), a compound of formula (I) may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (II):</p>\n  \n    \n  </p>\n  with a compound of formula (III)</p>\n  \n    \n  </p>\n  to form the intermediate imine, which may be isolated if required, followed by reduction of the imine using a suitable metal reducing agent such as a metal hydride, for example a borane hydride, alane hydride or a metal hydride complex like lithium aluminum hydride or sodium borohydride, or an organo- metaliic complex such as borane- methyl sulphide, 9-borabicyclononane (9-BBN), triethylsilane, sodium triacetoxyborohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride and the like. Alternatively, catalytic hydrogenation may be used, for example using a platinum catalyst in a suitable solvent e.g. ethanol.</p>\n  The condensation reaction conveniently takes place in a suitable solvent such as an alcohol (e.g. methanol), an aromatic hydrocarbon (e.g. benzene, toluene or xylene) or a chlorinated hydrocarbon (e.g. dichloromethane or d"
