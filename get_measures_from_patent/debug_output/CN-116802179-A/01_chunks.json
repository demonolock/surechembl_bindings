    "wed by incubation at room temperature for 7min to generate and stabilize luminescent signals corresponding to the amount of ATP and thus to the amount of metabolically active cells. Luminescence signals were measured using a PHERAstarFS reader (BMG). Determination of flatness Using GraphPad Prism software Uniform IC <sub>50</sub> Values. The data are shown in table 3.</p>Table 3:</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>ND: not determined; WT: wild type.</p>Biological examples: bcl-2-D103Y biochemical assay</p>Selected compounds of the present disclosure that block Bcl-2D103Y protein with ligands are tested in assays based on time resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer methods. A serial dilution of 0.05nM recombinant human Bcl-2-D103Y protein with a compound disclosed herein (highest final concentration 1uM, 4-fold serial dilution, 10-point) was pre-incubated for 0.5 hours at room temperature in assay buffer containing 20mM potassium phosphate buffer (DH 7.5), 50mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 0.05% Tween-20, 0.01% BSA. 2nM FITC-labeled Bak peptide Ac-GQVGRQLAIIGDK (FITC) INR-amide and Mab anti-6 His Tb crypt Gold were then added to the plates and incubated for an additional 1 hour at room temperature. The TR-FRET signal was read on a BMG PHERAstar FSX instrument (ex 337nm, em490nm/520 nm). Based on the fluorescence ratio at 490nm to 520nm, the percent inhibition of the interaction of the compound with its ligand at increasing concentrations was calculated for Bcl-2d103 y. The IC50 of each compound was deduced by fitting the data to a four-parameter logistic equation by Dotmatics. </p>Table 4: biochemical data for inhibition of mutant Bcl-2d103y</p></p></p></p></p></p>WT: wild type; bcl-2D 103Y: bcl-2 Asp103Tyr (D103Y) mutation</p>The compounds disclosed in the present application have a linker (-CH) <sub>2</sub> -, -O-or carbocycle) to an additional aromatic or carbocyclic moiety of a phenylpiperazine or phenylpiperidine moiety. As shown in the data of tables 3 and 4, this key feature exhibited comparable or slightly better inhibitory activity against Bcl-2 wild-type proteins. Unexpectedly, they also showed strong efficacy against mutants G101V and D103Y. As determined in tables 3 and 4, the ratio of IC50 of Bcl-2G101V/Bcl-2wt (examples 16, 19a, 23, 24b, 28-32, 39-59, 61, 68-73, 75-81, 83 and 84, 127, 141a, 145, 155, 232, 233, 338) was much lower than examples F132b and ABT-199 (Veneturab) in WO 2019210828. This trend also exists for the ratio Bcl-2D103Y/Bcl-2wt in Table 4, as in examples 16, 19a, 22a, 23, 24b, 26-30, 32-33, 39-43, 45-49, 51-53, 58, 59, 68, 72, 75, 78-81, 83 and 84, 127, 141a, 145, 155, which is significantly lower than F91b in WO 2019210828. These results indicate a new potential Bcl-2 inhibitor without the problem of resistance to mutations (e.g., G101V and D103Y). From the aspect of neutropenia adverse effects, these compounds present the potential for effective and safe doses of the novel therapies for clinically relapsing patients with mutations following treatment with valneturab. </p>Biological examples: metabolic stability study</p>The metabolic stability of some compounds was evaluated by using an in vitro liver microsome incubation system. Briefly, 1. Mu.M of test compound was incubated with 0.5mg/mL liver microsomes from different species (human, dog, rat and mouse) and NADPH regeneration system at 37 \u2103. Samples were quenched with an organic solvent containing an internal standard at three time points (0, 30, 60 min) and the supernatant analyzed for maternal loss via LC-MS/MS. Imidazole was used as a positive control to verify the incubation system.</p>The log residual percentage was plotted against incubation time for each compound and the slo"
