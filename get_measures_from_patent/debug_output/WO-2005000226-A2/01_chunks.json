    "re types of biomolecules have been identified as a biomolecular binder of the target cell component, constructing a pathogen strain having a regulatable gene encoding the biomolecular binder, regulating expression of the gene encoding the biomolecular binder to express the gene; and monitoring growth of the pathogen cells in culture relative to suitable control cells, whereby, if growth of the pathogen cells is decreased compared to growth of suitable control cells, then the biomolecule is a biomolecular inhibitor of growth of the pathogen cells.</p>Identifying compounds that inhibit infection of a mammal by a pathogen Another aspect of the invention is a method, employing an animal test, for identifying one or more compounds that inhibit infection of a mammal by a pathogen by binding to a target cell component, comprising constructing a pathogen comprising a regulatable gene encoding a biomolecule which binds to the target cell component, infecting test animals with the pathogen, regulating expression of the regulatable gene to produce the biomolecule, monitoring the test animals and suitable control animals for signs of infection, wherein observing fewer or less severe signs of infection in the test animals than in suitable control animals indicates that the biomolecule is a biomolecular inhibitor of infection, and identifying one or more compounds that compete with the biomolecular inhibitor of growth for binding to the target cell component (as by employing a competitive binding assay), then the compound inhibits infection of a mammal by a pathogen by binding to a target. The competitive binding assay to identify binding analogs of biomolecular binders, which have been proven to bind to their targets in an intracellular test of binding, can be applied to any target for which a biomolecular binder has been identified, including targets whose function is unknown or targets for which other types of assays are not easily developed and performed. Therefore, the method of the invention offers the advantage of decreasing assay development time when using a gene product of known function as a target cell component and the advantage of bypassing the major hurdle of gene function identification when using a gene product of unknown function as a target cell component. Other aspects of the invention are cells comprising a biomolecule and a target cell component, wherein the biomolecule is produced by expression of a regulable gene, and wherein the biomolecule modulates function of the target cell \n\ncomponent, thereby causing a phenotypic change in the cells. Yet other aspects are cells comprising a biomolecule and a target cell component, wherein the biomolecule is a biomolecular binder of the target cell component, and is encoded by a regulatable gene. The cells can include mammalian cells or cells of a pathogen, for instance, and the phenotypic change can be a change in growth rate. The pathogen can be a species of bacteria, yeast, fungus, or parasite, for example.</p>Intracellular validation of a biomolecule The invention provides methods that result in the identifica",
    "uman cells; GAL4 promoter can be activated by galactose in a nonglucose-containing medium. The location of the biomolecule binder genes can be extra chromosomal or chromosomally integrated. \n\nThe chromosome integration can be mediated through homologous or nonhomologous recombinations. For proper localization in the cells, it maybe desirable to tag the biomolecule binders with certain peptide signal sequences (for example, nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences, mitochondria localization sequences). Secretion sequences have been well documented in the art. Fused biomolecular binders For presentation of the biomolecular binders in the intracellular system, they can be fused N-terminally, C-terminally, or internally in a carrier protein (if the biomolecular binder is a peptide), and can be fused (5', 3' or internally) in a carrier RNA or DNA molecule (if the biomolecular binder is a nucleic acid). The biomolecular binder can be presented with a protein or nucleic acid structural scaffold. Certain linkages (e.g., a 4-glycine linker for a peptide or a stretch of A's for an RNA can be inserted between the biomolecular binder and the carrier proteins or nucleic acids. In such engineered cells, the effect of this biomolecular binder on the phenotype of the cells can be tested, as a manifestation of the binding (implying binding to a functionally relevant site, thus, an activator, or more likely, an inhibitory) effect of the biomolecular binder on the target used in an in vitro binding assay as described above. An intracellular test can not only determine which biomolecular binders have a phenotypic effect on the cells, but at the same time can assess whether the target in the cells is essential for maintaining the normal phenotype of the cells. For example, a culture of the engineered cells expressing a biomolecular binder can be divided into two aliquots. The first aliquot (\"test\" cells) can be treated in a suitable manner to regulate (e.g., induce or release repression of, as appropriate) the gene encoding the biomolecular binder, such that the biomolecular binder is produced in the cells. The second aliquot (\"control\" cells) can be left untreated so that the biomolecular binder is not produced in the cells. In a variation of this method of testing the effect of a biomolecular binder on the phenotype of the cells, a different strain of cells, not having a gene that can express the biomolecular binder, can be used as control cells. The phenotype of the cells in each culture (\"test\" and \"control\" cells grown under the same conditions, other than the expression of the biomolecular binder), can then be monitored by a suitable means (e.g., enzymatic activity, monitoring, a product of a biosynthetic pathway, antibody to test for presence of cell \n\nsurface antigen, etc.). Where the change in phenotype is a change in growth rate, the growth of the cells in each culture (\"test\" and \"control\" cells grown under the same conditions, other than the expression",
    "onstructed pathogen cells, the animals can be monitored for signs of infection (as the simplest endpoint, death of the animal, but also e.g., lethargy, lack of grooming behavior, hunched posture, not eating, dianhea or other discharges; bacterial titer in samples of blood or other cultured fluids or tissues). In the case of testing engineered tumor cells, the test and control animals can be monitored for the development of tumors or for other indicators of the proliferation of the introduced engineered cells. If the test animals are observed to exhibit less growth of the introduced cells than the control animals, then the biomolecule can be also called a biomolecular inhibitor of growth, or biomolecular inhibitor of infection, as appropriate, as it can be concluded that the \n\nexpression in vivo of the biomolecular inhibitor is the cause of the relative reduction in growth of the introduced cells in the test animals.</p>In vitro assays In alternative aspects, further steps of the procedure involve in vitro assays to identify one or more compounds that have binding and activating or inhibitory properties that are similar to those of the biomolecules which have been found to have a phenotypic effect, such as inhibition of growth. That is, compounds that compete for binding to a target cell component with the biomolecule would then be structural analogs of the biomolecules. Assays to identify such compounds can take advantage of known methods to identify competing molecules in a binding assay. These steps comprise general step (3) of the method. In one method to identify such compounds, a biomolecular inhibitor (or activator) can be contacted with the isolated target-cell component to allow binding, one or more compounds can be added to the milieu comprising the biomolecular inhibitor and the cell component under conditions that allow interaction and binding between the cell component and the biomolecular inhibitor, and any biomolecular inhibitor that is released from the cell component can be detected. Fluorescence One suitable system that allows the detection of released biomolecular inhibitor (or activator) is one in which fluorescence polarization of molecules in the milieu can be measured. The biomolecular inhibitor can have bound to it a fluorescent tag or label such as fluorescein or fluorescein attached to a linker. Assays for inhibition of the binding of the biomolecular inhibitor to the cell component can be done in microtiter plates to conveniently test a set of compounds at the same time. In such assays, a majority of the fluorescently labeled biomolecular inhibitor must bind to the protein in the absence of competitor compound to allow for the detection of small changes in the bound versus free probe population when a compound which is a competitor with a biomolecular inhibitor is added (B.A. Lynch, et al., Analytical Biochemistry 247:77-82 (1997)). If a compound competes with the biomolecular inhibitor for a binding site on the target c"
