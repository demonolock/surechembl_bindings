Assessment by ELISA on immobilized SIRPa-His of SIRP29 (\u0394) and Kwar23 (\u2218) at different concentrations incubated with constant concentration of biotinylated CD47-Fc (6 \u03bcg/ml). Revelation was performed with streptavidin peroxidase to detect CD47 molecule and revealed by colorimetry at 450 nm using TMB substrate. The results of a second experiment are given with the IC50 values. IC50 is the concentration of the indicated antibody to inhibit 50% of the signal in this assay.\n\n\nNote that there is only one sentence that meets the criteria, which mentions the IC50 value, but the actual numeric value is not provided in the text.
