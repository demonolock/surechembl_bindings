    " term \u201cSIRPg\u201d relates to a SIRPg from a mammal species, preferably a human SIRPg.</p>A reference sequence of the human SIRPg protein corresponds to the sequence associated to the Accession number Q9P1W8 or NM 018556.</p>An \u201canti-SIRPg antibody\u201d is an antibody that exhibits appreciable binding affinity for SIRPg and may or may not exhibit appreciable binding affinity for SIRPa, binding affinity being in each case detectable by methods known in the art like but not limited to Biacore analysis, Blitz analysis, ELISA assay or Scatchard plot. An \u201canti-SIRPg antibody\u201d may also be defined as an antibody that exhibits appreciable binding affinity for SIRPg and that blocks the interaction between CD47 and SIRPg. In a particular embodiment, such antibody may also exhibit appreciable affinity binding for SIRPa and may block the interaction between CD47 and SIRPa. By \u201cblock the interaction\u201d it should be understood that the antibody has an antagonist effect on the CD47/SIRPg interaction and, in a particular embodiment an antagonist effect on the CD47/SIRPa interaction.</p>The specific binding between the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof and the epitope (or the region comprising the epitope) implies that the antibody exhibits appreciable affinity for the epitope (the region comprising the epitope) on a particular protein or antigen (here: SIRPg). \u201cAppreciable affinity\u201d or \u201cspecific binding\u201d or \u201cspecifically bind to\u201d includes binding with an affinity of about 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M (KD) or stronger. Preferably, binding is considered specific when the binding affinity is between 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M (KD) and 10<sup>\u221212 </sup>M (KD), optionally between 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M (KD) and 10<sup>\u221210 </sup>M (KD), in particular at least 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M (KD). Whether a binding domain specifically reacts with or binds to a target can be tested readily by, inter alia, comparing the reaction of said binding domain with a target protein or antigen with the reaction of said binding domain with proteins or antigens other than the target protein. The terms \u201cspecific binding\u201d or \u201cspecifically bind to\u201d do not mean that an antibody recognizes and binds to a single target molecule, but that the antibody has a binding affinity that is higher for its target molecule relative to other molecules and in particular has a binding affinity for a target molecule over a given affinity as detailed here above. Used in the negative form, the terms \u201cspecific binding\u201d or \u201cspecifically bind to\u201d mean that an antibody recognizes the target molecule with a low affinity, or does not recognize the target molecule, i.e. the binding between the antibody and the target molecule is not specific. Preferably, a binding is recognized not specific when the binding affinity is lower than 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M (KD). Compared molecules in respect of which binding may be regarded as specific are in particular SIRPg and SIRPa.</p>The affinity can be determined by various methods well known from the one skilled in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, Biacore analysis, Blitz analysis and Scatchard plot.</p>In an embodiment, the anti-SIRPg antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof or antigen-binding antibody mimetic has a KD value inferior to 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, preferably inferior to 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>M for SIRPg, particularly by Blitz analysis.</p>The anti-SIRPg antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof or antigen-binding antibody mimetic of the invention significantly inhibits, decreases, antagonizes, or competes with the binding of CD47 to SIRPg.</p>This antagonist effect can be determined using the methods as defined in the examples of the present application.</p>In the invention, it can be considered that an antibody (or antigen-binding fragment thereof or antigen-binding antibody mimetic) inhibits the binding of CD47 to SIRPg if said antibody (or antigen-binding fragment thereof or antigen-binding antibody mimetic) induces an increase superior to 1 log, preferably superior to 2 log, more preferably superior to 3 log, most preferably superior to 4 log, of the KD value of CD47 in a SIRPg binding competitive assay by Blitz.</p>The invention is based on the unexpected observation made by the inventors that antagonist SIRPg antibodies can be useful for treating, preventing, thereby in particular encompassing inhibiting, slowing the progression of, or reducing the symptoms associated with a disease or a disorder in which T cells have deleterious effects, in particular an autoimmune disease, a chronic inflammatory disease, a chronic neuroinflammatory disease, an immune-metabolic disease, a cardiovascular disease caused by a systemic inflammation or a transplant dysfunction. In a particular embodiment of the invention, a transplant dysfunction does not include graft rejection.</p>A disease or a disorder in which T cells have deleterious effects include accordingly any disease or disorder wherein the T cells proliferation and/or activation have deleterious effects.</p>Given that antagonist SIRPg antibodies can reduce or inhibit the proliferation of T cells they can favor an immunosuppressive environment and be useful for the treatment of an autoimmune disorder or disease, a transplant dysfunction, or an inflammatory disease. Indeed, while the immune response is the host's normal and protective response to an injury or a disease, it can also cause undesired damages when it turns against host's cells.</p>In an embodiment, the invention relates to an anti-SIRPg antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof or antigen binding antibody mimetic ",
    "a. Therefore, the present invention also encompasses an anti-SIRPg antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof or antigen binding antibody mimetic which inhibits the binding of CD47 to SIRPg and/or which inhibits the proliferation of T-cells and which does not bind specifically to SIRPa and/or which does not inhibit the binding of CD47 to SIRPa, in particular antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof or antigen binding antibody mimetic which inhibits the binding of CD47 to SIRPg and which inhibits the proliferation of T-cells, in particular CD4+ T cells, and which does not bind specifically to SIRPa and which does not inhibit the binding of CD47 to SIRPa. It should be noted that the inhibition of the proliferation of T cells may be more important when such an anti-SIRPg antibody is used instead of an anti-CD47 antibody. In a particular embodiment of the invention, use of such an antibody decreases or inhibits the proliferation of T cells as compared with a negative control, in particular the decrease or inhibition of the proliferation of T cells is over 20%, and more preferentially over 50%, and most preferentially over 70%.</p>In a particular embodiment, the invention thus relates to an anti-SIRPg antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof or antigen binding antibody mimetic for its use as defined above, which does not specifically bind to SIRPa.</p>In a particular embodiment, the anti-SIRPg antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof or antigen-binding mimetic has a KD value about 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>or inferior for SIRPg and a KD value superior to 10-8 for SIRPa.</p>The antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof or antigen binding antibody mimetic can be administered in a variety of suitable routes, e.g., intravenously (IV), subcutaneously (SC), or, intramuscularly (IM) to the subject.</p>The antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof or antigen binding antibody mimetic can be administered alone or in combination with another therapeutic agent, e.g., a second human monoclonal antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof. In another example, the antibody is administered together with another agent, for example, an immunosuppressive agent, an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA), in combination with therapeutic cell compositions, and the like.</p>In an embodiment, the invention relates to an anti-SIRPg antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof or antigen binding antibody mimetic for its use as defined above, wherein the anti-SIRPg antibody or antigen-binding fragment is combined with a second therapeutic agent.</p>The administration of the second agent can be simultaneous or not with the administration of the anti-SIRPg antibody. Depending on the nature of the second agent, a co-administration can be prepared in the form of a combination drug, also known as a \u201ccombo\u201d. A combo is a fixed-dose combination that includes two or more active pharmaceutical ingredients combined in a single dosage form, which is manufactured and distributed in fixed doses.

Affinity Analysis of the Antibodies for SIRPq by Blitz MethodMethod: This method was performed with a Blitz (Fort\u00e9 Bio; USA; reference C22-2 No 61010-1). Recombinant hSIRPg-His (Sino Biologicals, Beijing, China; reference 11828-H08H) was immobilized at 10 \u03bcg/ml by histidine tail into a Ni-NTA biosensor (Fort\u00e9 Bio; USA; reference 18-0029) for 30 seconds. Then, an antibody was associated at 20 \u03bcg/mL for 120 seconds. The dissociation of antibody was made in kinetics buffer for 120 seconds. Analysis of data was made with the Blitz pro 1.2 software, which calculated association constant (ka) and dissociation constant (kd) and determined the affinity constant KD (ka/kd).</p>Results: As shown in FIG. 1, the antibodies Kwar23 and SIRP29 known to be anti-SIRPa antibodies in the previous art have a surprising affinity for SIRPg as well. LSB2.20 have a strong affinity for SIRPg.</p>Example 2. ELISA Binding of the Antibodies on SIRPgMethod: For activity ELISA assay, hSIRPg-His (Sino Biologicals, Beijing, China; reference 11828-H08H) was immobilized on plastic at 1 \u03bcg/ml in carbonate buffer (pH9.2) and purified antibody were added to measure binding. After incubation and washing, peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-human IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch; USA; reference 709-035-149) was added and revealed by conventional methods.</p>Results: As shown in FIG. 2, the antibodies SIRP29 and Kwar23 show a significant binding to SIRPg. The antibody LSB2.20 shows a very significant binding to SIRPg.</p>Example 3. Blitz Method Competition with CD47 for SIRPg: SIRPg+Antibody+CD47Method: This method was performed with a Blitz (Fort\u00e9 Bio; USA; reference C22-2 No 61010-1). In a first step, hSIRPg-His (Sino Biologicals, Beijing, China; reference 11828-H08H) was immobilized at 10 \u03bcg/ml by histidine tail into a Ni-NTA biosensor (Fort\u00e9 Bio; USA; reference 18-0029) for 30 seconds. In a second step, an antibody was added at 20 \u03bcg/mL (saturating concentration) for 120 seconds. Then, human CD47Fc ((Sino Biologicals, Beijing, China; reference 12283-H02H) was associated at 100 \u03bcg/mL, in competition with the antibody, for 120 seconds. The dissociation of CD47Fc was made in kinetics buffer for 120 seconds. Analysis data was made with the Blitz pro 1.2 software, which calculated association constant (ka) and dissociation constant (kd) and determined the affinity constant KD (ka/kd).</p>Results: As shown in FIG. 3, Kwar23 significantly reduces the binding of CD47 to SIRPg, contrary to SIRP29. While both antibodies recognize the same targets (SIRPa and SIRPg), SIRP29 has nevertheless no effect on the interaction of CD47 with SIRPg, i.e. it does not disrupt the binding of SIRPg to CD47.</p>Example 4. Human CD3+ T Cell ProliferationMethod: hPBMC were isolated from buffy coat of healthy volunteers. CD4 or CD8 T cells were selected by positive selection using an AutoMACS (Miltenyi) and plated in 96-round well plate (50 000 cells/well). The proliferative signals were provided by either anti-CD3/anti-CD28 coated microbeads (LifeTechnologies) at a 1 bead for 1 T cell ratio during three days, or allogeneic mature dendritic cells generated in vitro at a 5 T cell for 1 mDC during 5 days. Antibodies targeting the SIRPa/CD47 and/or the SIRPg/CD47 pathways were added from the beginning of the proliferation test at a saturating concentration (10 \u03bcg/mL). Proliferation was measured by incorporation of H<sup>3</sup>-thymidine during the last 12 h of culture.</p>Results: As shown in FIG. 4, anti-CD47 antibodies drastically decrease human T-cell proliferation (around 50% inhibition of T-cell proliferation). In house clone antibody disclosed in international patent application no PCT/EP2017/059071 that binds to SIRPa but not to SIRPg as well as the commercial antibody SE7C2 do not have any effect on the proliferation of T cells. Kwar23, which blocks both the SIRPa-CD47 a",
    "on the proliferation of T cells.</p>The specific anti-SIRPg antibody LSB2.20 inhibits T cell proliferation with the strongest efficacy, i.e. about 75% of inhibition. Accordingly, anti-SIRPg antibody is more potent for inhibiting the proliferation of T-cells than the anti-CD47 antibodies or antibodies targeting SIRPa only. Antibody targeting both SIRPa and SIRPg, and disrupting the interaction between CD47 and SIRPg, like Kwar23, also inhibits proliferation of T-cells but in a lesser extent than a specific anti-SIRPg antibody (i.e. an antibody that does not bind to SIRPa). Due to the lack of intracellular signaling of SIRPg into T cells (see Piccio et al, Blood 2005), the effect on the proliferation and/or activation of T cells seems to be specific to the inhibition of the binding of SIRPg to CD47 and the inhibition of CD47 dependent pathway in T cells. As illustrated, the use of the antibodies according to the invention does not enhance activation and/or proliferation of CD4+ T cells.</p>Example 5. Biosensor Affinity Measurement of the Antibodies for SIRPaMethod: Recombinant hSIRPa (Sino Biologicals, Beijing, China; reference 11612-H08H) was immobilized into a CM5 sensor chip (GeHealthcare; France) at 5 \u03bcg/ml (500RU) and antibodies were applied at different concentrations with a flow rate of 40 \u03bcl/min. Analysis was performed with a BIAcore 3000 (Biacore, GeHealthcare). Values were measured after an association period (ka) of 3 min followed by a dissociation period of 10 min (kd) to determine affinity constant (KD).</p>Results: As shown in FIG. 5, Kwar23 and SIRP29 have a strong affinity (KD) for SIRPa, which is better than the commercial antibody SE7C2.</p>Example 6. Affinity Analysis of the Antibodies for SIRPa by Blitz MethodMethod: This method was performed with a Blitz (Fort\u00e9 Bio; USA; reference C22-2 No 61010-1). hSIRPa-His recombinant protein (Sino Biologicals, Beijing, China; reference 11612-H08H) was immobilized at 10 \u03bcg/ml by histidine tail into a Ni-NTA biosensor (Fort\u00e9 Bio; USA; reference 18-0029) for 30 seconds. Then, anti-SIRPa antibody (in house specific antibody\u2014used as positive control for SIRPa binding analysis) and the anti-SIRPg antibody LSB2.20 were associated at 20 \u03bcg/mL for 120 seconds. The dissociation of antibody was made in kinetics buffer for 120 seconds. Analysis of data was made with the Blitz pro 1.2 software, which calculated association constant (ka) and dissociation constant (kd) and determined the affinity constant KD (ka/kd).</p>Results (illustrated on FIG. 5). The human LSB2.20 does not bind to the human SIRPa recombinant protein compared to the positive control anti-SIRPa antibody. Therefore, in correlation with the results of experiments of Example 1, LSB2.20 binds specifically to SIRPg, in particular human SIRPg, although the affinity of LSB2.20 for SIRPg seems to be weaker than the affinity of Kwar23 and SIRP29 antibodies for SIRPg. The combination of the results illustrated in this example and example 1 confirms that LSB2.20 is an antibody specific for SIRPg and does not recognize SIRPa.</p>Example 7. SIRPa Binding Assay on Human Monocytes by CytofluorometryMethod: To measure the binding of the antibodies on human monocytes, human Fc Receptor Binding Inhibitor (BD pharmingen; USA; reference 564220) was first added for 30 min at room-temperature to block human Fc receptors on human monocytes to reduce background. Then, an antibody was incubated for 30 min at 4\u00b0 C., and washed before stained 30 min at 4\u00b0 C. with PE-labelled anti-human IgG Fc (Biolegend; USA; reference 409303). Samples were analyzed on BD LSRII or Canto II cytofluorometer.</p>Results: As shown in FIG. 7, the results indicate a strong binding of the antibodies Kwar23 and SIRP29 on human monocytes.</p>Example 8. Competitive Analysis Between CD47 and the Antibodies by Antagonist ELISA AssayMethod: For competitive ELISA assay, recombinant hSIRPa (Sino Biologicals, Beijing, China; reference 11612-H08H) was immobilized on plastic at 0.5 \u03bcg/ml in carbonate buffer (pH9.2). Purified antibody (at different concentrations) was mixed with 6 \u03bcg/ml final (fix concentration) of biotinylated Human CD47Fc (AcroBiosystems interchim; France; reference: #CD7-H82F6) to measure competitive binding for 2 h at 37\u00b0 C. After incubation and washing, peroxidase-labeled streptavidin (Vector laboratoring; USA; reference SA-5004) was added to detect Biotin-CD47Fc binding and revealed by conventional methods.</p>Results: As shown in FIG. 8, the antibodies Kwar23 and SIRP29 have an antagonist activity on the SIRPa-CD47 interaction.</p>Example 9.
