    "es of photocrosslinking agents include aryl azides such as N-hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-azidobenzoate (HSAB) and N-succinimidyl-6(-4\u2032-azido-2\u2032-nitrophenylamino))hexanoate (SANPAH). Aryl azides conjugated to oligomers will effect crosslinking with nucleic acids and proteins upon irradiation. Other representative crosslinkcing agents are disclosed in International Patent Application Ser. No. PCT/US93/02059, filed Mar. 5, 1993, which is incorporated herein by reference. </p>[0119] Useful crown amines are disclosed by Studer, et al., Helv. Chim. Acta 1986, 69, 2081 and Smith-Jones, et al., Bioconjugate Chem. 1991, 2, 415. </p>[0120] Vitamins according to the invention generally can be classified as water soluble or lipid soluble. Water soluble vitamins include thiamine, riboflavin, nicotinic acid or niacin, the vitamin B<sub>6 </sub>pyridoxal group, pantothenic acid, biotin, folic acid, the B<sub>12 </sub>cobalamin coenzymes, inositol, choline and ascorbic acid. Lipid soluble vitamins include the vitamin A family, vitamin D, the vitamin E tocopherol family and vitamin K (and phytols). The vitamin A family, including retinoic acid and retinol, are absorbed and transported to target tissues through their interaction with specific proteins such as cytosol retinol-binding protein type II (CRBP-II), Retinol-binding protein (RBP), and cellular retinol-binding protein (CRBP). These proteins, which have been found in various parts of the human body, have molecular weights of approximately 15 kD. They have specific interactions with compounds of the vitamin A family, especially, retinoic acid and retinol. </p>[0121] The vitamin A family of compounds can be attached to oligomers of the invention via acid or alcohol functionalities found in the various family members. For example, conjugation of an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of an acid moiety of retinoic acid to an amine function of a pendant group of the oligomer results in linkage of the vitamin A compound to the oligomer, via an amide bond. In similar fashion, standard esterification chemistries may be used to attach the acid moiety of the retinoic acid group to a 4\u2032-oxygen of a compound of the invention, or to a hydroxyl function of a pendent group thereof. </p>[0122] \u03b1-Tocopherol (vitamin E) and other tocopherols (beta through zeta) can be similarly conjugated to oligomers also to enhance uptake due to their lipophilic character. The lipophilic vitamin, vitamin D, and its ergosterol precursors can be conjugated to oligomers through their hydroxyl groups by first activating the hydroxyl groups by forming, for example, hemisuccinate esters. Conjugation then is effected, as for instance, to an aminolinker pendant from the oligomer, or through other suitable functional groups described herein. Other vitamins that can be conjugated to oligomers through hydroxyl groups on the vitamins include thiamine, riboflavin, pyricdoxine, pyridoxamine, pyridoxal, deoxypyridoxine. Lipid soluble vitamin K's and related quinone-con",
    "are shown in Table IV, below. Results are shown in FIG. I.  \nTABLE IVControlling P\u2550S Linkages: ICAM-1 Activitywith Alternating P\u2550S/P\u2550O Linkages in a Uniform2\u2032-modifled OligomerIsis #Oligonucleotides Tested16952TCTGAGTAGCAGAGGAGCTCMOE, P\u2550O 16953GATCGCGTCGGACTATGAAGScrambled Control<sup>a</sup> 15537TGTGAGTAGCAGAGGAGCTCMOE, P\u2550S 16954GATCGCGTCGGACTATGAAGScrambled Control 18268TCTGAGTAGCAGAGGAGCTG*MOE, PS/PO\n</p>[0210] The scrambled oligomers 16953 and 16954, which have the same base composition as the parent sequence, serve as controls. </p>[0211] It can be seen that the ICAM-1 expression data (FIG. I) reveal that the staggered oligomer 18268 is more efficacious than both P\u2550O oligomer (16952) and P\u2550S oligomer(15537) in HUVEC cells. The oligomers are presumably working by a direct binding RNase H independent mechanism. </p>EXAMPLE 4 Pharmacokinetic studies [0212] Modulation of protein binding by P\u2550S/P\u2550O oliigonucleotide </p>[0213] Various pharmacokinetic parameters of oligonucleotides 11158, 11159 and 18268 of Example 2 were determined. The oligonucleotides were studied for various effects including modulation of protein binding and tissue distribution. The studies were performed in male Sprague-Dawley rats using I.V. bolus administration of 3H radio labeled oligonucleotides. The results are listed in Table V.  \nTABLE VComparative Plasma Pharmacokinetic ParametersPK ParameterISIS 11159ISIS 18268ISIS 11158Cl<sub>p </sub>(ml/min)2.176.869.62T<sub>\u00bd</sub> distrib.

The P\u2550O/P\u2550S alternating oligonucleotide, ISIS 18268, has higher plasma concentration than ISIS 11158 (MOE, P\u2550O) but: less than the MOE P\u2550S oligonucleotide, ISIS 11159, as is seen in FIG. 2. This also compares well with the serum albumin binding data seen in Table V. </p>[0215] The alternating fully modified MOE P\u2550S/P\u2550O oligonucleotide, ISIS 18268, bound to HSA with an affinity between that for the full P\u2550S and the full P\u2550O. This was measured by ultrafiltration techniques using fatty acid free albumin. </p>Changes in Tissue Distribution [0216] The tissue distribution of the radio labeled oligonucleotides was examined in Sprague-Dawley rats following I.V. bolus administration. The results are shown in FIG. 3. </p>[0217] In these vivo pharmacokinetic studies, the P\u2550S/P\u2550O alternating oligonucleotide, ISIS 18268, exhibits reduced kidney distribution and increased overall tissue distribution compared to uniform P\u2550O oligonucleotide, ISIS 11158. This also resulted in lower urinary excretion: 13% excreted in 6 hours compared to 48% in the same time period (6hrs) for P\u2550O oligonucleotide. The P\u2550S olilgonucleotide, ISIS 11159, showed more compound in liver than both P\u2550O and P\u2550S/P\u2550O oligonucleotides. </p>[0218] It is intended that each of the patents, applications, printed publ"
