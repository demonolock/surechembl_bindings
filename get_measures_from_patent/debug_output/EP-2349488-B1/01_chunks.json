    "olymeric mineral surface active agents include the carboxy-substituted alcohol polymers described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,292,501</patcit>; 5,213,789</patcit>, 5,093,170</patcit>; 5,009,882</patcit>; and 4,939,284</patcit>; all to Degenhardt et al. and the diphosphonate-derivatized polymers in U.S. patent 5,011,913 to Benedict et al</patcit>; the synthetic anionic polymers including polyacrylates and copolymers of maleic anhydride or acid and methyl vinyl ether (e.g., Gantrez\u00ae), as described, for example, in U.S. Patent 4,627,977, to Gaffar et al.</patcit> A preferred polymer is diphosphonate modified polyacrylic acid. Polymers with activity must have sufficient surface binding propensity to desorb pellicle proteins and remain affixed to enamel surfaces. For tooth surfaces, polymers with end or side chain phosphate or phosphonate functions are preferred although other polymers with mineral binding activity may prove effective depending upon adsorption affinity.</p>Additional examples of suitable phosphonate containing polymeric mineral surface active agents include the geminal diphosphonate polymers disclosed as anticalculus agents in US 4,877,603 to Degenhardt et al</patcit>; phosphonate group containing copolymers disclosed in US 4,749,758 to Dursch et al.</patcit> and in GB 1,290,724 (both assigned to Hoechst</patcit>) suitable for use in detergent and cleaning compositions; and the copolymers and cotelomers disclosed as useful for applications including scale and corrosion inhibition, coatings, cements and ion-exchange resins in US 5,980,776 to Zakikhani et al.</patcit> and US 6,071,434 to Davis et al</patcit>. Additional polymers include the water-soluble copolymers of vinylphosphonic acid and acrylic acid and salts thereof disclosed in GB 1,290,724</patcit> wherein the copolymers contain from about 10% to about 90% by weight vinylphosphonic acid and from about 90% to about 10% by weight acrylic acid, more particularly wherein the copolymers have a weight ratio of vinylphosphonic acid to acrylic acid of 70% vinylphosphonic acid to 30% acrylic acid; 50% vinylphosphonic acid to 50% acrylic acid; or 30% vinylphosphonic acid to 70% acrylic acid. Other suitable polymers include the water soluble polymers disclosed by Zakikhani and Davis prepared by copolymerizing diphosphonate or polyphosphonate monomers having one or more unsaturated C=C bonds (e.g., vinylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid and 2-(hydroxyphosphinyl)ethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid), with at least one further compound having unsaturated C=C bonds (e.g., acrylate and methacrylate monomers). Suitable polymers include the diphosphonate/acrylate polymers supplied by Rhodia under the designation ITC 1087 (Average MW 3000-60,000) and Polymer 1154 (Average MW 6000-55,000).</p>A preferred PMSA will be stable with other components of the oral care composition such as ionic fluoride and metal ions. Also preferred are polymers that have limited hydrolysis in high water content formulations, thus perm",
    "ositions and compatibility data. Figure 9(a) shows peroxide-containing compositions with various precipitated and fused silicas. Figure 9(b) shows the peroxide compatibility of the compositions, at 40 \u00b0C, initially, after 6 days, and after 13 days. The data shows superior peroxide compatibility with the fused silicas over the precipitated silicas. In some embodiments, the peroxide compatibility is at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, or at least about 85% after about 13 days at 40\u00b0C. Stated another way, in some embodiments, after about 13 days at 40\u00b0 C, at least about 50%, 60%, 70%, or 85% of the peroxide or oxidizing agent may remain.</p>Method for sample preparation is as follows: Transfer 18 g of peroxide gel base in a plastic container; mix thoroughly 2 g of silica with spatula; measure pH of the mixture; divide the mixture into two equal parts and place one part at 25 \u00b0C and the other at 40 \u00b0C; place samples in stability chamber at 25 \u00b0C and 40 \u00b0C. Sample analysis is as follows: Take an initial sample for peroxide analysis; take out samples from stability chambers at 5 and 12 days and allow to equilibrate for 1 day; remove 0.2 g of samples from each mixture and place remaining samples back in the stability chamber; perform peroxide analysis as follows: weigh 0.2000 g (+/-0.0200g) of the peroxide gel into a 250L plastic beaker; add stir bar and 100ml of 0.04N H2SO4, cover with parafilm, stir for at least 10 minutes; add 25mL 10% KI solution and 3 drops of NH4-Molybdate and stir additional 3-20 minutes; analyze via autotitration with 0.1N Na-Thiosulfate. Compatibility is defined as the peroxide percent after 13 days at 40\u00b0C divided by the initial peroxide percent, then multiplied by 100. It is known to those of ordinary skill in the art that a product placed at 40\u00b0C represents an extended shelf life. That is, for example, one month at 40\u00b0C would roughly approximate eight months at room temperature.</p>Figure 10(a) shows formulas A-E that are oral care compositions comprising fused silica and peroxide. Figure 10(b) shows the change in brightness (\u0394 L) of bovine enamel specimens after a given number of brush strokes for two of the compositions in figure 10(a) that have fused silica and peroxide, in comparison to a formula with fused silica but not peroxide (formula F), and a formula with neither fused silica nor peroxide (Crest Cavity Protection Toothpaste). The data demonstrates that the combination of fused silica and peroxide delivers superior cleaning and whitening. In some embodiments, the delta L may be greater than about 4.5 at 50 strokes, greater than about 6.0 at 100 strokes, greater than about 9.0 at 200 strokes, or greater than about 15.0 at 400 strokes. In some embodiments, the delta L may be from about 50% to about 100% greater than Crest Cavity Protection Toothpaste. The method is as follows: Substrates of bovine enamel are mounted and stained per conventional PCR protocol described by G.K"
