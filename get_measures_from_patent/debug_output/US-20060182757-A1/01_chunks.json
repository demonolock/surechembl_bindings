    "or more members of the plasmid-borne Aggregative Adherence Fimbriae (AAF) family. (Nataro et al., Infect Immun 60:2297-2304 (1992); Czeczulin et al., Infect Immun 65:4135-4145 (1997)). Two of members of the AAF family, AAF/I and AAF/II, have been characterized at the genetic level and each is encoded on a large plasmid (designated pAA). (Savarino et al., J Bacteriol 176:4949-57 (1994); Elias et al., J Bacteriol 181:1779-85 (1999)). It has been shown that the human pathogenic strain 042 requires AAF/II fimbrial antigen for adherence of the bacterium to the colonic mucosa, thereby suggesting that this adhesin is a virulence factor for human infection. (Czeczulin et al., Infect Immun 65:4135-4145 (1997)). </p> It has been shown that the majority of EAEC strains lack AAF/I and AAF/II. (Czeczulin et al., Infect Immun 67:2692-2699 (1999)). Nevertheless, most EAEC strains carry the ca. 100 kb pAA plasmid, recognized by the presence of several conserved loci. The most prominent among these loci is a transcriptional activator of the AraC class designated AggR, which is required for expression of both AAF/I and AAF/II. AggR is also present in a large percentage of EAEC strains that do not express any identified AAF. (Nataro et al., J Bacteriol 176:4691-4699 (1994)). Recently, a novel AggR-dependent gene lying immediately upstream of AggR in EAEC 042 has been identified and characterized. (Sheikh et al., J Clin Invest (in press) (2002)). This AggR-dependent gene encodes a secreted 10.2 kD protein, designated Aap, that appears to coat the bacterial surface and promote dispersion of EAEC on the intestinal mucosa. Aap has alternatively been designated dispersin. It has been shown that Aap mutants form larger aggregates, fewer individual bacteria, and aggregate more intensely than the wild type. In addition, Aap partially counteracts AAF-mediated aggregation and may play a fundamental role in EAEC pathogenesis. Moreover, the data suggest that Aap binds non-covalently to the bacterial cell surface. However, the mechanism by which Aap is translocated across the outer membrane is as yet unknown. </p> Another prominent locus is the binding site of a DNA probe, CVD432, on the plasmid. The CVD432 probe was developed to simplify the identification of EAEC and has been used as the AA probe. (Baudry et al., J Infect Dis 161:1249-1251 (1990)). In its original evaluation, the probe was found to be 89% sensitive and 99% specific for EAEC. The nucleotide sequence of the AA probe represented a cryptic open reading frame (ORF) located adjacent to the plasmid replicon. (Nataro et al., Infect Immun 64:4761-4768 (1996)). Further sequence analysis of the AA probe region revealed five ORFs. The predicted protein of one of the ORFs was similar with the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) domain of the ABC transporter, suggesting that the gene cluster is involved in the transport of an unidentified molecule of EAEC. Furthermore, this gene cluster appears to be associated with the translocati",
    "he culture media (data not shown). Thus, AatA exists mainly on the outer membrane. To determine whether AatA is translocated to the outer membrane using the energy generated by the ABC transporter junction of AatC, 042aatC and 042aatD are examined for AatA by Western immunoblot. AatA is observed in the outer membranes of both 042aatC and 042aatD (data not shown). </p> The aat Cluster is Associated with the Secretion of a Dispersin Aap </p> The transmembrane domain of the importers among the prokaryote ABC transporters invariably carries a conserved motif, EAA, in the C-terminal. (Holland, J Mol Biol 293:381-399 (1999)). Because the motif is not observed in the amino acid sequences of the aat cluster, it is hypothesized that the aat cluster exports an unidentified protein across the inner and/or outer membrane. To verify the hypothesis, the differences in secreted proteins between the wild type and the mutant in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of culture media precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (TCA) are investigated. Strain 042 and 042aatA was cultured in high-glucose DMEM over night. The culture media were precipitated with TCA, boiled for 5 min, and separated using 15% SDS-PAGE. No significant differences of SDS-PAGE patterns of the culture media of L-broth are observed. However, a slight difference in high-glucose DMEM (FIG. 4A), in which AggR is known to be expressed, is observed. </p> Silver staining of the gel shows a band of 10 kD in wild type EAEC, but not in 042aatA. Because the molecular size of the mature Aap is known to be 10.2 kD, this secreted protein is predicted to be Aap. Aap is known to bind non-covalently to the bacterial cell surface, and to be easily released into the culture media by adding Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 0.1% into the medium. SDS-PAGE of the supernatant of the culture is performed with 0.1% Triton X-100. (See FIG. 4B). SDS-PAGE of the culture media of 042, 042aatA, 042aatC, 042aatD, and 042pet. The strains were cultured in high-glucose DMEM containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 6 hours. The culture media were precipitated with TCA, boiled for 5 min, separated using 15% SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie blue. The band in the wild type is easily observed by the Coomassie-staining. On the other hand, the band is not observed in 042aatA, 042aatC, and 042aatD. To eliminate the possibility of an effect of pJP5603, the mutant 042pet, which harbors pJP5603 integrated into the gene of the EAEC toxin pet, is examined as a control. The 042pet shows the same band as the wild type. </p> This 10 kDa secreted protein is confirmed to be Aap by western immunoblot. (See FIG. 5). Each strain was cultured in high-glucose DMEM for 6 hours with and without 0.1% Triton, and the supernatant was precipitated with TCA. The samples were then boiled and separated using 15% SDS-PAGE. The western immunoblot was performed by standard methods using the specific polyclonal antibodies against Aap. </p> As shown in FIG. 5, Aap is observed in the supernatant of wild type EAEC in high-glucose DMEM, bu"
