Note </p>that the spring forces in membrane are a combination of conservative elastic forces, that may be expressed in terms of the energy potential above, and dissipative forces to be defined </p>below. The first term in (17) corresponds to the attractive wormlike chain (WLC) potential, and the second term defines a repulsive force for n &gt; 0 to be called the power force (POW), so that we abbreviate this spring model as WLC-POW. Note that if n = 1 the power force energy should be defined as <sup>'</sup> -<sup>\u25a0</sup>\" . A non-zero equilibrium spring length is </p>defined by the balance of these two forces. </p>The bending energy represents the bending resistance of the lipid bilayer and is </p>defined as </p>;; \u03af . .. V , </p>where kb is the bending constant, 9j is the instantaneous angle between two adjacent triangles having the common edge j, and \u03980 is the spontaneous angle. </p> The area and volume conservation constraints which account for area- incompressibility of the lipid bilayer and incompressibility of the inner cytosol, respectively, are expressed as \n\n \n<img id=\"imgf000143_0001\" path=\"imgf000143_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/169643353/WO/20110929/A2/002011/11/94/92/imgf000143_0001.tif\"/>\n </p>where ka, kd and kv are the global area, local area and volume constraint coefficients, respectively. The terms A and V are the total area and volume of RBC, while <sup>*</sup> Hi and y are the specified total area and volume, respectively. Note, that the above expressions define global area and volume constraints, and the second term in equation (19a) incorporates the local dilatation constraint. Detailed description and discussion of the RBC model can be found in (8, 9). </p> Particle forces are derived from the above energies as follows \n<img id=\"imgf000143_0002\" path=\"imgf000143_0002.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/169643354/WO/20110929/A2/002011/11/94/92/imgf000143_0002.tif\"/>\n </p> Exact force expressions can be found in (7). </p>2.1 Mechanical properties </p> Linear analysis of the regular hexagonal network having the above energies yields a relationship between macroscopic elastic properties (shear, area-compression, and Young's moduli) of the network and model parameters (8, 9). The membrane shear modulus is thus given by: \n<img id=\"imgf000143_0003\" path=\"imgf000143_0003.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/169643355/WO/20110929/A2/002011/11/94/92/imgf000143_0003.tif\"/>\n where 10 is the equilibrium spring length and <sup>\u00be &gt;i</sup> '.

    "5 Simulation setup and parameters </p> RBC suspension (blood) is subjected to linear shear flow with periodic Lees-Edwards boundary conditions (14). The computational domain has the size of 45.0 x 32.0 x 27.222 in DPD units, where 168 RBCs and 117599 solvent particles are placed. RBCs are represented by 500 DPD particles forming a triangulated network on the surface defined in equation (15). The RBC diameter and the membrane Young's modulus are DO = 8.06 and Y0 = 415.5 in model units, respectively, which correspond to DO = 7.82 \u03bc\u03b9\u03b7 and Y0 = 18.9 \u03bc\u039d/m in physical units. The membrane shear modulus is \u03bc\u03b8 = 106, while xO = 2.2 and n = 2 in equation (21). We employ the stress-free model (8, 9) which eliminates local membrane artifacts (stresses) due to the membrane triangulation. Thus, each spring assumes its own equilibrium length <sup>\" :</sup>* <sup>'</sup> ' <sup>s</sup>, which is set to the edge lengths after the RBC shape triangulation, since we assume it to be the equilibrium state. Accordingly we define </p><sup>&lt;i</sup>m&lt;:<sup>;.3</sup>: \u00be ^ and <sup>*</sup> ^0<sup>\u00bb</sup> ^ ' <sup>*</sup> * for each triangular plaquette. The total RBC area \n\n ' to: </p>and the total volume are calculated from the RBC triangulation. Then, for each spring we can calculate pi and <sup>?&gt;</sup> (eq. (17)) for the given parameters \u03bc\u03b8, \u00be, and <sup>m</sup> using p . _ Q </p>equation (21) and the equality <sup>v</sup>\u00bb T e area and volume constraints coefficients were set to ka = 4900, kd = 100, and kv = 5000 (eqs. (l la,b)). The bending rigidity kc is set to 3xl0-19J, which is equal to approximately 70kBT at physiological temperature T = 37o C. The membrane viscosity is set to be approximately 12\u03b70, where \u03b7\u03b8 is the suspending fluid viscosity. </p> Interactions between different RBCs include the short range repulsive Lennard- Jones potential defined in equation (28). The corresponding potential parameters were set to o = 1.0 and aLJ = 0.3. These interactions result in a thin layer next to a RBC membrane which cannot be accessed by other cells. This layer can be interpreted as a slight increase of the RBC volume. Therefore, the RBC volume was assumed to be slightly larger than that of the triangulated network (V0 = 92.45) due to the repulsive RBC-RBC interactions. The effective RBC volume was estimated from an analysis of the distance between surfaces of several RBCs in equilibrium and was equal to V ' = 105. The cell volume fraction or hematocrit was calculated as follows </p>/\u00b7 \u2014 - fl\u20acf </p> 1 where Nc is the number of RBCs in the volume Vt. </p> RBC aggregation interactions were mediated by the Morse potential (eq. (27)). The Morse potential parameters were set to De = 0.3, rO = 0.3, \u03b2 = 1.5, and rM = 1.1. The choice of rO was correlated with the Lennard- Jones characteristic length aLJ = 0.3. Other parameters were calibrated for a single point of the viscosity-shear rate curve, while all other simulations were performed for the same set of parameters. </",
