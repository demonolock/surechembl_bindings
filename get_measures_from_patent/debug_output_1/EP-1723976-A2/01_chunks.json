    "affecting the balance between acetylation and deacetylation can ultimately impact gene transcription, and subsequently, cell proliferation as proliferative pathways depend to a significant degree on gene transcription. Histone deacetylase are of two general classes, RPd3-like and Hdal-like proteins.</p>Other drugs, agents and or compounds that may be utilized include other histone deacetylase inhibitors, which include trichostatin A, its analogs and derivatives as well as similar agents. These agents include short-chain fatty acids, such as butyrate, phenylbutyrate and valproate, hydroxamic acids, such as trichostatins, SAHA and its derivatives, oxamflatin, ABHA, scriptaid, pyroxamide, and propenamides, epoxyketone-containing cyclic tetrapeptides, such as trapoxins, HC-toxin, chlamydocin, diheteropeptin, WF-3161 and Cyl-1 and Cyl-2, non-epoxyketone-containing cyclic tetrapeptides such as, FR901228</patcit> and apicidin, benzamides, such as MS-275 (MS-27-275), Cl-994 and other benzamide analogs, and various miscellaneous structures, such as depudecin and organosulfur compounds.</p>Trichostatin A is a histone deacetylase inhibitor that arrests tumor cell proliferation predominantly in the G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle. The G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle are the phases characterized by gene transcription. The anti-proliferative activity and point of cell cycle arrest profile of trichostatin A have been characterized primarily in tumor cell lines with anti-proliferative IC50's in the low nM range (Woo et al., J. Med Chem, 45: 2877-2885, 2002). In addition, trichostatin A has been shown to have anti-angiogenic activity (Deroanne et al., Oncogene 21 (3): 427-436, 2002).</p>In in vitro cell culture studies, trichostatin A has been shown to completely inhibit human coronary artery smooth muscle cell proliferation and has an anti-proliferative IC50 of approximately 6 nM. Figure 51 is a graph of the inhibition of coronary artery smooth muscle cells by trichostatin A in a cell culture study. It is therefore possible that trichostatin A, delivered locally, may substantially inhibit neointimal formation following vascular injury.</p>Rapamycin, as described above, is a macroyclic triene antibiotic produced by streptomyces hygroscopicus as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,929,992</patcit>. It has been found that rapamycin inhibits the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells in vivo. Accordingly, rapamycin may be utilized in treating intimal smooth muscle cell hyperplasia, restenosis and vascular occlusion in a mammal, particularly following either biologically or mechanically mediated vascular injury, or under conditions that would predispose a mammal to suffering such a vascular injury. Rapamycin functions to inhibit smooth muscle cell proliferation and does not interfere with the re-endothelialization of the vessel walls.</p>Rapamycin functions to inhibit smooth muscle cell proliferation through a number of mechanisms. In addition, rapamycin reduces the other effects caused by vascular injury, for example, inflammation. The mechanisms of action and various functions of rapamycin are described in detail below. Rapamycin as used throughout this application shall include rapamycin, rapamycin analogs, derivatives and congeners that bind FKBP12 and possess the same pharmacologic properties as rapamycin, as described in ",
    "ective at inhibiting peripheral leukemic blood cell proliferation and bone marrow cells are also effective at inhibiting proliferating vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells. Cladribine may therefore be therapeutically useful for inhibition of the intimal smooth muscle cell proliferation which accompanies stent implantation.\nTABLE 7. Inhibition of human vascular cell proliferation with cladribine.Cladribine (nM)ControlVehicle0.0010.010.1110100100010,000SMC100108-1048685545812-4EC10010010090797559573510Values represent % of PDGF-stimulated increase in cell count. Each % is the mean of triplicate determinations. SMC, smooth muscle cells; EC, endothelial cells.</p>Cladribine or 2- chlorodeoxyadenosine is a purine antimetabolite prodrug that undergoes intracellular phosphorylation and incorporation into the DNA of proliferating cells. This leads to DNA strand breaks and inhibition of DNA synthesis. Cladribine is capable of arresting cells at the G1/S phase interface. Thus it is possible that cladribine may inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and inhibit inflammatory cell function secondary to revascularization procedures.</p>Figure 58 illustrates, in graphical format, the anti-proliferative activity of cladribine in non-synchronized cultured human coronary artery smooth muscle cells stimulated with two percent fetal bovine serum. As illustrated, cladribine completely inhibits human coronary artery smooth muscle cell proliferation and has an anti-proliferative IC50 of approximately 241 nanomolar. It is therefore possible that cladribine itself, delivered locally, may substantially inhibit neointimal formation following vascular injury.</p>As rapamycin and cladribine act through different molecular mechanisms affecting cell proliferation at different phases of the cell cycle, it is possible that these agents, when combined on a drug eluting stent or any other medical device as defined herein, may potentiate each other's anti-restenotic activity by downregulating both smooth muscle cell and immune cell proliferation by different mechanisms. In non-synchronized cultured human coronary artery smooth muscle cells studies, the addition of cladribine to cells treated with rapamycin resulted in a leftward and upward shift of the anti-proliferative rapamycin dose response curves, as set forth in detail below, suggesting that cladribine does in fact potentiate the anti-proliferative activity of rapamycin in coronary artery smooth muscle cells. The combination of rapamycin and cladribine may be utilized to enhance the anti-restenotic efficacy following vascular injury and a reduction in the required amount of either agent to achieve the anti-restenotic effect. The combination may be particularly relevant to the subpopulations of patients that are resistant to single drugs regimens such as rapamycin or paclitaxel coated stents.</p>Referring to Figure 57, there is illustrated, in graphical format, the anti-proliferative activity of rapamycin, w"
