Many methods for the preparation of such formulations are patented or generally known to those skilled in the art.</p>A method of using a modified IgG antibody may comprise causing or allowing binding to TGF\u03b2. Such binding may take place in vivo, e.g., following administration of a modified IgG antibody to a patient, or it may take place in vitro, e.g., in ELISA, Western blotting, immunocytochemistry, immunoprecipitation, affinity chromatography, or cell based assays, or in ex vivo based therapeutic methods, e.g., methods in which cells or bodily fluids are contacted ex vivo with a modified IgG antibody and then administered to a patient.</p>A kit comprising a modified IgG antibody is provided. The modified IgG antibody may be labeled to allow its reactivity in a sample to be determined. Kits may be employed in diagnostic analysis, for example. A kit may contain instructions for use of the components. Ancillary materials to assist in or to enable performing such a method may be included within the kit.</p>The reactivity of a modified IgG antibody in a sample may be determined by any appropriate means, e.g., radioimmunoassay (RIA). Radioactively labeled antigen may be mixed with unlabeled antigen (the test sample) and allowed to bind to the modified IgG antibody. Bound antigen is physically separated from unbound antigen and the amount of radioactive antigen bound to the modified IgG antibody is determined. A competitive binding assay also may be used with non-radioactive antigen, using an antigen or an analogue linked to a reporter molecule. The reporter molecule may be a fluorochrome, phosphor, or dye. Suitable fluorochromes include fluorescein, rhodamine, phycoerythrin and Texas Red. Suitable chromogenic dyes include diaminobenzidine.</p>Other reporters include macromolecular colloidal particles or particulate material such as latex beads that are colored, magnetic or paramagnetic, and biologically or chemically active agents that can directly or indirectly cause detectable signals to be visually observed, electronically detected or otherwise recorded. These molecules may be enzymes that catalyze reactions that develop or change colors or cause changes in electrical properties, for example. They may be molecularly excitable, such that electronic transitions between energy states result in characteristic spectral absorptions or emissions. They may include chemical entities used in conjunction with biosensors. Biotin/avidin or biotin/streptavidin and alkaline phosphatase detection systems may be employed. The signals generated by antibody-reporter conjugates may be used to derive quantifiable absolute or relative data of the relevant antibody binding in samples.</p>Also disclosed is the use of a modified IgG antibody for measuring antigen levels in a competition assay. The modified IgG antibody can be linked to a reporter molecule so that a physical or optical change occurs on binding, for e",
    "n Figure 6 suggested that, like the mutants in the light chain elbow region, addition of amino acids in the elbow region of CAT192 heavy chain also improved the binding affinity to TGF\u03b21. For example, the CAT192 HC+GGGGS mutant showed very high affinity binding to TGF\u03b21.</p>Example 3: Heavy and Light Chain Combination MutantsCombination CAT192 mutants were created by co-transfection DNAs harboring mutants at the elbow regions of both heavy and light chains using the Expi293F transfection system (Life Technologies) in a 24-well plate format (4 x 1mL).

The results shown in Figure 3 suggested that the combination mutants restored the high affinity binding to TGF\u03b21 of CAT192.

    "to the heavy chain S228P IgG4 backbone to minimize the half-antibody formation, and Expi293F cells were then co-transfected with CAT192 IgG4 S228P HC and the LC insertion mutant.</p>A 30mL transfection was performed on the full length CAT192 HC and LC insertion mutants in order to obtain enough material for the bioassay. Expi293F cells were transfected with 30 \u00b5g DNA (15 \u00b5g LC + 15 \u00b5g HC). Conditioned media was collected 4 days after the transfection and anaylzed by Octet using Protein A biosensors to have around 200 \u00b5g/mL expression. The CM was then purified using Hi-Trap Protein A HP columns with a peristaltic pump. CM was loaded onto each column at 0.5 mL/min, washed with 25 column volumes (CV) of 50 mM NaPi, 25 mM NaCl pH 7.1 (2 mL/min), washed with 25 CV of 10 mM sodium succinate pH 6.0 (2 mL/min), and eluted in 3 x 2 mL fractions with 10 mM sodium succinate pH 3.75 at 1 mL/min (labeled #1,#2,#3). The protein A eluates were neutralized with 0.2 M NaOH, and 0.2 M NaCl was added for a final concentration of 40 mM NaCl. The samples were then concentrated and buffer exchanged into 50 mM NaPi, 25 mM NaCl pH 7.1. These CAT192 IgG4 S228P HC and LC insertion mutant protein A eluates were then run on a 4-20% Tris Glycine gel (Figure 3) and compared by Biacore for TGF\u03b21/ TGF\u03b22/ TGF\u03b23 binding (Figure 4). Biacore results showed that the purified CAT192 IgG4 mutants indeed regained TGF\u03b21 binding. None of the mutants bound to TGF\u03b22 or TGF\u03b23 (Figure 4).\nTable 7 TGF\u03b21-Binding Affinity (KD) of the Full-length IgG4 Variants as Determined by BiacoreSamplek<sub>a</sub> (\u00d710<sup>5</sup>/Ms)k<sub>d</sub> (\u00d710<sup>-4</sup>/s)K<sub>D</sub> (nM)CAT192 IgG4 S228Pn/dn/d&gt;100CAT192 IgG4 S228P LC+G0.155.2636.1CAT192 IgG4 S228P LC+GG1.00.20.2CAT192 IgG4 S228P LC+GGS0.82.22.7CAT192 IgG4 S228P LC+GGGS0.60.61.0CAT192 IgG4 S228P LC+GGGGS0.61.52.6CAT192 IgG4 S228P HC+G0.52.14.1CAT192 IgG4 S228P HC+GG1.02.02.2CAT192 IgG4 S228P HC+GGGGS1.11.51.3CAT192 IgG4 S228P HC+GG/ LC+GG2.40.50.2n/d = none detected</p>The CAT192 IgG S228P LC insertion mutants were then characterized in a A549 cell potency assay (Rapoza et al., 2006, J Immunol Methods, Vol316, pp18). The results (Figure 5) showed that the CAT192 insertion mutants neutralized TGF\u03b21 activity, as demonstrated by the inhibitory effects by the mutants on TGF\u03b21-stimulated IL-11 production. It appeared that two glycines added to the light chain elbow were sufficient to for CAT192 to regain efficacy, as observed in the Biacore binding experiment.</p>Example 5: Thermostability StudyDifferential Scanning Fluorimetry (DSF) was performed on the elbow-insertion mutants to determine how the additional amino acids at the hinge region of heavy chain and light chain affected the thermostability of the CAT192 Fab insertion mutants. The basic principle of DSF is that as the temperature increases, a fluorescent dye binds to the hydrophobic regions of the protein as it unfolds providing an increase in signal. This method can be performed with "
