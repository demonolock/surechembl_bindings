Activation of hM1 (human Muscarinic receptor subtype 1 , gene bank access NM_000738), rM1 (rat Muscarinic receptor subtype 1 , gene bank access NM_080773), hM3 (human Muscarinic receptor subtype 3, gene bank access NM_000740NM_000740) and hM5 (human Muscarinic receptor subtype 5, gene bank access NM_0121258), receptors expressed in CHO cells (Chinese hamster ovary cells, ATCC) is quantified in a Molecular Devices FLIPR MTM instrument as an increase in fluorescent signal. Inhibition \n\n of hM3 and hM5 by compounds is determined by the decrease in fluorescent signal in response to 2 nM acetylcholine activation.</p>CHO cells are plated in 384-well black/clear bottom poly-D-lysine plates (Becton Dickinson, 4663) at 8000 cells/well/50\u03bcl for 24 hours in a humidified incubator (5% CO2 and 37oC) in DMEM/F12 medium (Wisent 319-075-CL) without selection agent. Prior to experiment, the cell culture medium is removed from the plates by inversion. A loading solution of 25\u03bcl of Hank's balanced salt solution 1X (Wisent 311-506-CL), 10 mM Hepes (Wisent 330-050-EL) and 2.5 mM Probenicid at pH 7.4 (Sigma Aldrich Canada P8761- 10Og) with 2\u03bcM calcium indicator dye (FLUO-4AM, Molecular Probes F14202) and Pluronic acid F-127 0.002% (Invitrogen P3000MP) is added to each well. Plates are incubated at 37\u00b0C for 60 minutes prior to start the experiment. The incubation is terminated by washing the cells four times in assay buffer, leaving a residual 25\u03bcl buffer per well. Cell plates are then transferred to the FLIPR, ready for compound additions.</p>The day of experiment, acetylcholine and compounds are diluted in assay buffer in three-fold concentration range (10 points serial dilution) for addition by FLIPR instrument. For all calcium assays, a baseline reading is taken for 10 seconds followed by the addition of 12.5\u03bcl of compounds, resulting in a total well volume of 37.5\u03bcl. Data is collected every second for 60 pictures and then every 6 seconds for 20 pictures prior to the addition of agonist. For hM3 and hM5, before agonist addition, a second baseline reading is taken for 10 seconds followed by the addition of 12.5\u03bcl of agonist or buffer, producing a final volume of 50\u03bcl. After agonist stimulation, the FLIPR continues to collect data every second for 60 pictures and then every 6 seconds for 20 pictures. The fluorescence emission is read using filter 1 (emission 510-570 nm) by the FLIPR on board CCD camera. Calcium mobilization output data are calculated as the maximal relative fluorescence unit (RFU) minus the minimal value for both compound and agonist reading frame (except for hM1 and rM1 using only the maximal RFU). Data are analyzed using sigmoidal fits of a non-linear curve-fitting program (XLfit version 4.2.2 Excel add-in version 4.2.2 build 18 math 1 Q version 2.1.2 build 18). All pEC50 and plC50 values are reported as arithmetic means \u00b1 standard error of mean of 'n' independent experiments.</p>hM2 receptor GTPyS binding</p>Membranes produced from Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) expressing the cloned human M2 receptor (human Muscarinic receptor subtype 2, gene bank access NM_000739), are obtained from Perkin-Elmer (RBHM2M). The membranes are thawed at \n\n 37 \u00b0C, passed 3 times through a 23-gauge blunt-end needle, diluted in the GTPyS binding buffer (50 mM Hepes, 20 mM NaOH, 100 mM NaCI, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCI<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4, 100\u03bcM DTT). The EC<sub>5</sub>O, IC<sub>5</sub>O and E<sub>max</sub> of the compounds of the invention are evaluated from 10-point dose-response curves (three fold concentration range) done in 60\u03bcl in 384- well non-specific binding surface plate (Corning). Ten microliters from the dose-response curves plate (5X concentration) are transferred to another 384 well plate containing 25\u03bcl of the following: 5\u03bcg of hM2 membranes, 500\u03bcg of Flashblue beads (Perkin-Elmer) and GDP 25\u03bcM. An additional 15\u03bcl containing 3.3X (60,000 dpm) Of GTPy<sup>35</sup>S (0.4 nM final) are added to the wells resulting in a total well volume of 50\u03bcl. Basal and maximal stimulated [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPyS binding are determined in absence and presence of 30 \u03bcM final of acetylcholine agonist. The membranes/beads mix are pre-incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature with 25 \u03bcM GDP prior to distribution in plates (12.5 \u03bcM final). The reversal of acetylcholine-induced stimulation (2\u03bcM final) of [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPyS binding is used to assay the antagonist properties (IC<sub>5</sub>o) of the compounds. The plates are incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature then centrifuged at 400rpm for 5 minutes. The radioactivity (cpm) is counted in a Trilux (Perkin-Elmer).</p>Values of EC<sub>5</sub>O, IC<sub>5</sub>O and E<sub>max</sub> are obtained using sigmoidal fits of a non-linear curve-fitting program (XLfit version 4.2.2 Excel add-in version 4.2.2 build 18 math 1Q version 2.1.2 build 18) of percent stimulated [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPyS binding vs. log(molar ligand).

Briefly, rats are anesthetized with isoflurane, the left L5 and L6 are isolated and tightly ligated with 4-0 silk thread. The wound is closed by suturing and applying tissue adhesive. Compound testing is performed at day 9 to day 36 post-surgery.</p>For behavioral testing, the animals are acclimatized to the test room environment for a minimum of 30 min. In order to assess the degree of hyperalgesia, the animals are placed on a glass surface (maintained at 30 \u00b0C), and a heat-source is focused onto the plantar surface of the left paw. The time from the initiation of the heat until the animal withdraws the paw is recorded. Each animal is tested twice (with an interval of 10 min between the two tests). A decrease in Paw Withdrawal Latency (PWL, average of the two tests) relative to na\u03cave animals indicates a hyperalgesic state. The rats with a PWL of at \n\n least 2 seconds less than average PWL of Na\u03cave group are selected for compound testing.</p>Each individual experiment consists of several groups of SN"
