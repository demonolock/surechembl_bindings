The peptides spanning the influenza matrix 1\nprotein of A/PR/8/43 that were used as control peptides in the ELISPOT assay consisted\nof sixteen 30-mer peptides overlapping by 15 amino acids. Peptides were synthesized\nand dissolved as described previously (van der Burg et al., 1999). </p>\n  Recombinant HPV16-E7 protein, HPV16-E6 protein and HIV-1 RT protein (the latter\ntwo proteins served as control proteins in proliferation assays) were produced in\nrecombinant E. coli transformed with Pet-19b-HPV16-E7, Pet-19b-HPV16-E6 (De\nBruijn et al., 1998) or Pet-19b-HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) and purified as\ndescribed previously (van der Burg et al., 1999).\nMemory Response Mix (MRM): A mixture of tetanus toxoid (1 LF/ml; National Institute\nof Public Health and the Environment, Bilthoven, The Netherlands) and Mycobacterium\ntuberculosis sonicate (2.5\u00b5g/ml; generously donated by Dr. P. Klatser, Royal Tropical\nInstitute, The Netherlands ) was used to control the capacity of PBMC to proliferate in\nresponse to typical recall antigens.</p>\n  \n    HLA-DR-peptide binding assay.\n  \n  Binding of peptides was measured as reported previously (van der Burg et al., 1999).\nBriefly, as a source of HLA-DR molecules B-lymphoblastic cell lines homozygous for\nHLA-DR were used: LG2.1 (DRB*0101, DR1), IWB (DRB1*0201, DR2), HAR\n(DRB*0301, DR3), BSM (DRB*0401, DR4) and Pitout (DRB1*0701, DR7). DR\nmolecules were purified by affinity chromatography and the purity confirmed by SDS-PAGE.\nThe analysis of peptide binding to purified HLA-DR molecules was performed\nusing N-terminally fluorescence-labeled standard peptides. As standard fluorescent\npeptides in the binding assays, either HA 308-319 (PKYVKQNTLKLAT, DR1 and DR2),\nhsp65 3-13 (KTIAYDEEARR, DR3), HA 308-319 Y?F (PKFVKQNTLKLAT, DR4) or Ii\n80-103 (LPKPPKPVSKMRMATPLLMQA LPM, DR7) were used.</p>\n  \n    Immunogenicity Assay.\n  \n  HPV16-E7 derived peptide induced proliferation of PBMC isolated from blood obtained\nfrom healthy donors was measured as described previously (van der Burg et al., 1999).\nBriefly, PBMC were seeded at a density of 1.5x10<sup>5</sup> cells/well of a 96 well U-bottom plate\n(Costar, Cambridge, MA) in 200 \u00b5l of ISCOVE's medium (Gibco) enriched with 10%\nautologous serum, in the presence or absence of 10\u00b5g/ml of indicated 22-mer E7\npeptide. As positive control, PBMC were cultured in the presence of a Memory\nResponse Mix. Peptide specific proliferation was measured at day 6 by tritium-thymidine\nincorporation. Peptides were scored as immunogenic, i.e., able to stimulate\nT-cells, when the ",

This resulted in a pronounced IFN\u03b3 -\nproduction towards influenza M1-derived peptides in the CD45RO+ (memory) subset of\nT-cells but not in na\u00efve T-cells obtained from adult PBMC (unpublished observations).\nFollowing 4 days of incubation at 37\u00b0C, PBMC were harvested, washed and seeded in\nsix replicate wells at a density of 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well of a Multiscreen 96-well plate (Millipore,\nEtten-Leur, The Netherlands) coated with a IFN\u03b3 catching antibody (Mabtech AB,\nNacha, Sweden). The ELISPOT was further performed according to the instructions of\nthe manufacturer (Mabtech). The number of spots were analyzed with a fully\nautomated computer assisted video imaging analysis system (Carl Zeiss Vision).\nSpecific spots were calculated by subtracting the mean number of spots + 2xSD of the\nmedium only control from the mean number of spots of experimental wells. Antigen-specific\nT-cell frequencies were considered to be increased compared to non-responders\nwhen T-cell frequencies were more than 1/10,000 PBMC.</p>\n  \n    Results\n  \n  \n    Identification of the immunogenic sequences within HPV16 E7.\n  \n  We set out to identify the sequences within the HPV16 E7 protein that function as\nmajor immunogenic determinants in the context of MHC class II. A set of HPV16 E7\nderived overlapping peptides was tested for binding to HLA-DR 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 in a\nquantitative peptide/MHC binding assay (Geluk et al., 1995). Together, these HLA-DR\nmolecules cover at least 50-60% of the caucausian, oriental and negroid populations\n(Baur et al., 1984). Four peptides, E7<sub>1-22</sub>, E7<sub>41-62</sub>, E7<sub>51-72</sub> and E7<sub>77-98</sub>, bound to three or\nmore different HLA-DR molecules (Table I): peptide E7<sub>1-22</sub> bound to HLA DR2, 3, 4 and\n7, peptide E7<sub>41-62</sub> bound to DR1, 2, 3 and 4 whereas peptide E7<sub>51-72</sub> bound to DR1, 3 and\n7 and peptide E7<sub>77-98</sub> bound to DR1, 2 and DR7. This is in accordance with the fact that\nthe peptide binding restrictions for MHC class II molecules were found to be less strict\nthan those for MHC class I (Rammensee et al., 1995). Of note, these peptides failed to\nbind to one or two other DR molecules tested indicating that their binding, although\nrather ubiquitous in character, was specific. </p>\n  Our subsequent experiments focused on the four peptides binding to multiple HLA-DR\nmolecules, as these are the most likely to comprise naturally presented T-helper (Th)\nepitopes (Geluk et al., 1998). We analyzed whether the peptides could stimulate T-cells\nto proliferate by adding these to PBMC from 13 HLA-typed healthy blood donors. This\nassay does not discriminate between the reactivity of memory T-cells and naive, in\nvitro, primed T-cells but can be readily employed for identification of immunogenic\npeptides (van der Burg et al., 1999). All four peptides were able to stimulate\nproliferative r",
    "of which have a length of 30 amino acids and one of which (E2<sub>331-365</sub>) has a\nlength of 35 amino acids, was used. These peptides share an overlap of 15 amino acids.\nFor epitope fine-mapping and the determination of cross-reactivity of HPV16-E2 specific\nTh-clones, peptides with a length of 15 and 20 amino acids were used. The peptides\nspanning the Influenza Matrix 1 protein of A/PR/8/34, which were used as control\npeptides in ELISPOT assays, consisted of 16 30-mer peptides overlapping by 15 amino\nacids. Peptides were synthesized by solid phase technique on an automated multiple\npeptide synthesizer (Abimed AMS 422, Langenfeld, Germany), and analysed by reverse\nphase HPLC. The lyophilized peptides were dissolved in 50\u00b5l of DMSO, diluted in PBS\nto a final concentration of 2.5 mg/ml. The HPV16 E2 C-terminal (E2<sub>280-365</sub>) protein and\nHPV16 E7 protein were produced according to previously described procedures\n(Franken et al., 2000)\nMemory Response Mix (MRM), consisting of a mixture of tetanus toxoid (0.75 LF/ml\nfinal concentration; National Institute of Public Health and Environment, Bilthoven,\nThe Netherlands), Mycobacterium tuberculosis sonicate (2.5\u00b5g/ml; generously donated\nby Dr.P. Klatser, Royal Tropical institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and Candida\nalbicans (0.005%, HAL Allergenen Lab, Haarlem, The Netherlands), was used to\nconfirm the capacity of PBMC to proliferate and produce cytokine in response to\ncommon recall antigens.</p>\n  \n    HLA-DR - peptide binding assay\n  \n  Binding of peptides to HLA-DR was measured as reported previously (van der Burg et\nal., 1999). Briefly, as a source of DR molecules B-LCL homozygous for DR were used:\nLG2.1 (DRB*0101, DR1), IWB (DRB1*0201, DR2), HAR (DRB*0301, DR3), and BSM\n(DRB*0401, DR4). DR molecules were purified by affinity chromatography and the\npurity confirmed by SDS-PAGE. The analysis of peptide binding to purified DR\nmolecules was performed using N-terminally fluorescence-labeled standard peptides. As\nstandard peptide in the binding assays HA<sub>308-319</sub> (PKYVKQNTLKLAT, DR1 and DR2),\nhsp65 3-13 (KTIAYDEEARR, DR3) or HA<sub>308-319</sub> Y\u2192F (PKFVKQNTLKLAT) was used.</p>\n  \n    Short-term T cell proliferation assay\n  \n  Immunogenicity of individual HPV16 E2 peptides was determined by short term\nproliferation assays of healthy donor PBMC with HPV16-E2 peptides, according to\npreviously described procedures (van der Burg et al. 1999). Briefly, freshly isolated\nPBMC were seeded at a density of 1.5 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well in a 96-well U-bottom plate\n(Costar, Cambridge, MA) in 200\u00b5l of IMDM (Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium, Bio\nWhittaker, Verviers, Belgium) supplemented with 10% autologous serum (10% FCS was\nused for CBC cultures). HPV16-E2 peptides were added at a concentration of 10\u00b5g/ml.\nMedium alone was taken along as negative control; phytohemagglutinine (PHA,\n0.5\u00b5g/ml) served as a positive control. For each peptide 8 parallel micro-cultures were\ninitiated; each donor ",
    ">271-300</sub> and E2<sub>286-315</sub>, peptides E2<sub>301-330</sub> and E2<sub>316-345</sub>, or with peptide E2 <sub>331-365</sub>. PBMC\nfrom 2 donors showed strong peptide-specific proliferative responses against one or\nmore of the stimulating peptides (data not shown). Through cloning via limiting dilution\nof these cultures, we succeeded in the isolation of stable T cell clones, uniformly\ndisplaying a CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup> phenotype, against four distinct peptide-epitopes. Two of these\nTh clones were established from HLA-DR15(2)-, -DQ6(1)- PBMC stimulated with E2<sub>301-330</sub>\nand E2<sub>316-345</sub>. Although both Th-clones recognized E2<sub>301-330</sub>, in depth analysis of the\nspecificity of these Th-clones revealed that they recognized distinct, yet overlapping,\nsequences, restricted by different class II HLA molecules. One of the clones recognized\npeptide E2<sub>316-330</sub> in the context of HLA-DR15(2), whereas the other clone was specific for\npeptide E2<sub>311-325</sub> in the context of HLA-DQ6(1) (Figures 5, 6). The two other Th-clones\nwere similarly related, in that one recognized peptide E2<sub>346-355</sub> in the context of DR15(2),\nwhereas the other reacted against E2<sub>351-365</sub> in a DR1-restricted manner (Figures 7, 8).\nNotably, these data are in correspondence with the peptide binding data in Table V, in\nthat longer variants of these DR15(2) and DR1-restricted epitopes were indeed found to\nbind to the restricting HLA molecules (binding assay not available for HLA-DQ6).\nFurther evidence that the four E2 peptides identified represent physiologically relevant\nTh epitopes is provided by the fact that the E2-specific Th clones did not only respond\nagainst peptide-loaded APC, but also specifically responded against APC that were\npulsed with the E2 protein (Figures 5-8). Because in the latter case presentation of the \npeptide epitopes depends on uptake and processing of the E2 antigen, and not merely on\nexogenous loading of class II molecules at the APC cell surface, these data provide\ndefinite proof that the four E2 peptides recognized by our Th clones correspond to\nnaturally processed epitopes. Finally, all four Th-clones produced IFN-\u03b3 upon antigenic\nstimulation, which is indicative of a Th-type 1 cytokine profile. Taken together our data\nshow that the T cell repertoire of healthy individuals harbors IFN-\u03b3-secreting E2-specific\nCD4<sup>+</sup> Th cells (Figures 5-8).</p>\n  \n    Detection of HPV16 E2 specific memory Th-cells in healthy individuals\n  \n  The strikingly frequent detection of HPV16 E2-specific Th immunity in healthy\nindividuals, as described in the first paragraph, prompted us to analyse whether the\nunderlying T cell repertoire would represent immunological memory as a the result of\nprevious encounter with antigen, or whether it would primarily consist of particularly\nabundant naive T cell precursors specific for this antigen.
