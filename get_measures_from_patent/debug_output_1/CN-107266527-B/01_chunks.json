In the measurement of the total antioxidant capacity and the reducing power, the higher the absorbance value is, the stronger the activity is; in the determination of the scavenging ability of superoxide anion radicals and hydroxyl radicals, the greater the scavenging rate, the greater the activity. The clearance was calculated according to equation (1).</p>R\uff1d(D0\uff0dD)/D0\u00d7100\uff05\u3002   (1)</p>Wherein R represents clearance; d0 represents the absorbance of the control tube; d represents the absorbance of the sample tube.</p>VC was used as a positive control in all tests, and the IC50 (total antioxidant capacity and reducing power, corresponding to the absorbance value of 0.5; the other 50% clearance) of the sample and VC were calculated based on the test results, and the VC equivalent weight of the sample (mg VC per gram of proteoglycan, i.e. IC50 of VC divided by IC50 of proteoglycan) was calculated.</p>TABLE 1 antioxidant Activity of the extracted active polysaccharide proteins</p></p>Experimental example 2</p>Active polysaccharide protein inhibition tumor cell test</p>HeLa cells are adopted as the cells; the culture conditions were: culturing in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 1% glutamine (200mmo1/L), penicillin (100IU/mL) and streptomycin (100mg/L) at 37 deg.C, CO<sub>2</sub>The concentration was 5%. HeLa cells were cultured in a 24-well plate in a medium of 500. mu.L for 24 hours, and then 100. mu.L of an extract distilled water solution of 10. mu.g, 20. mu.g, 40. mu.g, or 80. mu.g was added thereto, and the culture was continued for 24 hours and observed. The results are shown in FIG. 1.</p>In vitro antitumor Activity evaluation Using MTT method</p>The culture conditions of the HeLa cell and the human lung cancer cell (A549) are as follows: culturing in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 1% glutamine (200mmo1/L), penicillin (100IU/mL) and streptomycin (100mg/L) at 37 deg.C, CO<sub>2</sub>The concentration was 5%. The effect of the extracted active polysaccharide protein on the growth of HeLa and A549 cells is evaluated by adopting an MTT method. The culture density of HeLa cells or A549 cells in a 96-well plate is 5X 10<sup>4</sup>cell/mL. The proteoglycan protein sample solution containing the culture medium is added for a fixed time. The culture broth was removed for 24 h. The c"
