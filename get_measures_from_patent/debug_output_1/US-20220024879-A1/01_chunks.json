    "were infected with Jct with renilla luciferase for 4 h in presence of different concentrations of compounds. Viruses and compounds were removed, cells were washed with PBS and fresh medium was added. After 48 h, cells were washed with PBS and lysed with MilliQ water. Firefly luciferase activity was evaluated by adding 20 \u03bcL of cell lysates into assay buffer (25 mM glycylglycine, 15 mM MgSO4, 4 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 2 mM ATP, 15 mM K2PO4) and luciferin solution (200 \u03bcM luciferin, 25 mM glycylglycine, pH 8) and measured for 20 seconds in a luminometer (Centro XS3 LB960; Berthold). Renilla luciferase activity was measured by adding 20 \u03bcL of cell lysates into renilla luciferase substrate in PBS (1 \u03bcM of coelenterazin; P.J.K.) and measured for 2 seconds in a luminometer (Centro XS3 LB960; Berthold).\n\nWimley White hydrophobicity analysis: Analysis of E1 protein hydrophobicity was conducted using the Membrane Protein Explorer software package which is made available by the white laboratory (UC, Irvine, USA) under the URL (http://blanco.bio-mol.uci.edu/mpex/). Primary amino acid sequence of full length E1 coding sequences of given strains were used for prediction selecting interfacial hydrophobicity for the analysis. Smoothed hydropathy was plotted, neutralized His residues and predicted hydrophobic segments were include as well.\n\nStatistical Analyses: Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 7.04 or version for Windows (GraphPad Software, La Jolla Calif. USA, www.graphpad.com). IC50 values were calculated using the nonlinear regression model implemented in GraphPad with the least squares fitting method and fixed upper and lower plateaus. Differences in normalized mean infection efficiencies were tested for significance using ordinary two-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison tests. P-values below the level of 0.05 were considered significant (*p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001, ****p&lt;0.0001).\n\nVirtual screening to identify HCV membrane fusion inhibitors: Computational studies were undertaken to identify compounds similar to flunarizine and chlorcyclizine, which exhibit antiviral activity by inhibiting Hepatitis C virus (HCV) cell entry. The structure of N-terminal domain of HCV glycoprotein E1 was obtained from PDB 4UOI. The structure was minimized using forcefield Amber10:EHT of Molecular operating environment (MOE, chemical computing group), Molecular Operating Environment (MOE). Chemical Computing Group Inc., 1010 Sherbooke St. West, Suite #910, Montreal, QC, Canada, H3A 2R7, 2013; 2013.08. Small molecule databases (Approx. 7-8 million small molecules) were screened for those small molecules, which resemble chemically to flunarizine or chlorcyclizine. Resulting small molecules were docked on E1, and were ranked on the basis of binding energy calculations after Molecular dynamics simulations. Once a compound was found active experimentally, further computational calculations involved sub-structure similarity search using finge",
    "azine, fluphenazine, trifluoperazine, mequitazine, cis-flupentixol and cyproheptadine, which are from the diphenyl piperazine, diephenyl piperidine, phenothiazine, thioxanthene and cycloheptene piperidine families, respectively, as potent HCV entry inhibitors (FIG. 1). Passaging of an HCV genotype 2a virus (Jc1) in the presence of flunarizine yielded a combination of three mutations that map to the E1 and E2 proteins and which confer a ca. 50-fold resistance to flunarizine, Perin see above. These mutations also conferred cross-resitance to pimozide, fluphenazine, and trifluoperazine. To explore if susceptibility to other phenothiazine-, thioxanthene- or cycloheptene piperidine-derived entry inhibitors was also affected by these residues, we infected cells in the presence of increasing doses of these compounds with either the parental Jc1 renilla luciferase virus (JcR2a) or the flunarizine-resistant variant carrying four mutations (M267V and Q289H in E1 and M405T in E2 and I757T in p7; JcR2a-Flun-R which is J6-Flun R) (data not shown). Note that among these four mutations only the three changes in E1 and E2 contribute to flunarizine resistance. Curcumin, a structurally unrelated HCV entry inhibitor, was used as control (FIG. 1). As expected, all compounds dose-dependently inhibited JcR2a infection. Except for curcumin, which equally inhibited JcR2a and the flunarizine resistant Jc1 variant JcR2a-Flun-R, all other compounds were much less active against JcR2a-Flun-R (change in IC50 18 to 275-fold). These results obtained herein indicate that M267V, Q289H and M405T mutations confer cross-resistance to diphenyl piperazine, diphenylpiperidine, phenothiazine, thioxanthene and cyloheptene piperidine based HCV entry inhibitors and suggest that these molecules inhibit HCV cell entry through a common mechanism.</p>Diphenyl Piperazines, Diphenyl Piperidines, Phenothiazines, and Thioxanthenes Inhibit Low pH-Triggered HCV Cell Membrane Fusion</p>HCV infects liver cells by way of virus-cell membrane fusion, which is essential to deliver the viral genomic RNA into hepatocytes for initiation of infection. Fusion occurs after the virus has interacted with receptors and is internalized into endosomes. These receptor interactions prime the E1/E2 proteins to respond to the acidified pH in endosomes with conformational changes that mediate virus-host cell membrane fusion. When acidification of endosomes is inhibited\u2014for instance by treatment with Concanamycin A that inactivates endosomal ATPases needed for acidification of these organelles\u2014HCV infection is ablated. Under these circumstances infection can be rescued by briefly washing virus exposed cells with a low pH buffer that triggers virus-membrane fusion and allows infection. Using this setup we recently provided evidence that flunarizine specifically inhibits HCV membrane fusion since application of this compound only during the 5 minute low pH wash was sufficient for its full antiviral activity (data not shown",
    "mproved cross-genotype antiviral activity (fluphenazine and trifluoperazine. This broad analysis of related compounds permits a more precise definition of the chemical space of these membrane fusion inhibitors. Our analysis particularly demonstrates the importance of the cinnamyl group as attractive element for expanding the SAR-studies for achieving improved antiviral properties. The possibility of synthesizing azido- and 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3H-diazirine derivatives (table 1, entries 4 and 14) paves the way for initiating studies on target elucidation for this group of potential antiviral agents.</p>Identification of viral determinants for susceptibility to these compounds is important to select patients that may benefit from treatments involving such molecules. This information is also critical to guide development of improved membrane fusion inhibitors with regard to potency and possibly also cross-genotype coverage. By using a series of chimeras between the sensitive J6 strain and a resistant GT2b isolate J8 we pinpointed viral determinants of flunarizine sensitivity. We identified a central hydrophobic region in J6-E1 (J6-E1-R3.2; Aa 290-312) to be most important for controlling sensitivity to this compound. In fact, four residues within this region and which are conserved among sensitive GT2a strains (M/V290, W299, V301, P310) and where resistant GT2b strains encode a conserved alternative reside (A290, N299, T301, Q310) cause and 8-fold, 6-fold or 27-fold shift of the IC50 of flunarizine, chlorcyclizine and p-methoxy-flunarizine, respectively. Notably, these amino acids also influence responsiveness of J6 E1 to low pH-triggered membrane fusion. While parental J6 is sensitive to fluanrizine and fuses only in presence of very low pH, J6/J8-E1R3.2_4 aa is much more resistant and it accepts a more neutral pH for membrane fusion (FIG. 5). These changes are accompanied by a remarkable alteration of hydrophobicity in the central hydrophobic region directly downstream of the putative fusion loop. In the mutant J6 protein (J6/J8-E1R3.2_4aa) the hydrophobic stretch is disrupted and the two proximal His residues end up in a more hydrophilic environment. Notably, HCV strains that have natural resistance to flunarizine also display a disrupted central area of hydrophobicity and their His residue most closely downstream of the putative fusion loop is in a more hydrophilic environment. Taken together these findings suggest that analysis of the hydrophobicity within the E1 region proximal to the putative fusion loop including the assessment of the hydrophobicity around the adjacent His predicts viral sensitivity to flunarizine and related membrane fusion inhibitors. Beyond this, our data demonstrate that viral determinants in this E1 region control requirements for low pH-dependent membrane fusion, possibly by modifying the accessibility and protonation of His residues close to the putative fusion loop. Therefore, these findings provide an algorithm for s"
