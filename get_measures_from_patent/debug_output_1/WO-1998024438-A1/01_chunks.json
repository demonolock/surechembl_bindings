CNS-penetrant NK-1 receptor antagonists of use in the present ivnention are also effective in the attenuation of separation-induced vocalisations by guinea-pig pups as hereinafter defined.</p>\n  Essentially, a vocalisation response in guinea-pig pups is induced by isolation from their mothers and littermates, which response is attenuated when a CNS-penetrant NK-1 receptor antagonist is administered subcutaneously 30 minutes prior to isolation, wherein vocalisations during the first 15 minutes of isolation are attenuated with an IDso&lt;20mg/kg, preferably with an IDjo\u226410mg/kg, and especially with an IDso\u2264\u03b4mg/kg. In an alternative method, the NK-1 receptor antagonist is administered orally, 4 hours prior to isolation, wherein vocalisations \n\n during the first 15 minutes of isolation are attenuated with an ID50\u226420mg/kg, preferably with an ID\u03b4o\u2264lOmg/kg, and especially with an IDso\u2264\u03b4mg/kg.</p>\n  A suitable selection cascade for NKi antagonists of use according to \u03b4 the present invention is as follows:</p>\n  (i) Determine affinity for human NKi receptor in radioligand binding studies (Assay 1); select compounds with IC50 \u2264 lOnM, preferably IC<sub>50</sub> &lt; 2nM, especially IC50 &lt; InM.</p>\n  (ii) Determine ability of compounds to penetrate CNS by their 10 ability to inhibit foot tapping in gerbils induced by central injection of an NKi agonist (Assay 2); select compounds that inhibit foot tapping with ID50 &lt; 3mg/kg i.v., and preferably ID50 \u2264 lmg/kg i.v. when administered immediately prior to central NKi agonist challenge, or ID50 \u2264 30mg/kg p.o., and preferably ID50 \u2264 lOmg/kg p.o. 1 hour prior to challenge, l\u03b4 (iii) Determine central duration of action of compounds in gerbil foot tapping assay following intravenous administration 24 hours prior to central NKi agonist challenge; select compounds showing &lt; 2\u03b4-fold loss of potency compared with IDso determined in step (ii) above with the proviso that ID50 \u2264 lOmg/kg i.v., and preferably &lt; \u03b4mg/kg i.v. after 24 hour 20 pre-treatment.</p>\n  (iv) Determine oral bioavailability of compounds by pharmacokinetic analysis, activity in gerbil foot tapping assay following oral administration and/or by ability to inhibit cisplatin-induced emesis in ferrets (Assay 3); select compounds with ID90 \u2264 3mg/kg p.o., and preferably \n<img id=\"imgf000039_0001\" path=\"imgf000039_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/168084808/WO/19980611/A1/001998/02/44/38/imgf000039_0001.tif\"/>\n</p>\n  Particularly preferred compounds of use in the present invention are identified using steps (i) to (iv) followed by step (v):</p>\n  (v) Determine activity of compounds in assays sensitive to conventional ant"
