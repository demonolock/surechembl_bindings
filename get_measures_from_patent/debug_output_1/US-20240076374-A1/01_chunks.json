Dynamic range generally refers to a ratio of (a) a maximum detected level of a parameter under a first set of conditions to (b) a minimum detected value of that parameter under a second set of conditions. For example, in the context of an activatable antibody, the dynamic range refers to the ratio of (a) a maximum detected level of target protein binding to an activatable antibody in the presence of at least one protease capable of cleaving the CM of the activatable antibodies to (b) a minimum detected level of target protein binding to an activatable antibody in the absence of the protease. The dynamic range of an activatable antibody can be calculated as the ratio of the dissociation constant of an activatable antibody cleaving agent (e.g., enzyme) treatment to the dissociation constant of the activatable antibodies cleaving agent treatment. The greater the dynamic range of an activatable antibody, the better the switchable phenotype of the activatable antibody. Activatable antibodies having relatively higher dynamic range values (e.g., greater than 1) exhibit more desirable switching phenotypes such that target protein binding by the activatable antibodies occurs to a greater extent (e.g., predominantly occurs) in the presence of a cleaving agent (e.g., enzyme) capable of cleaving the CM of the activatable antibodies than in the absence of a cleaving agent.</p><p id=\"p-0350\" num=\"0333\">Activatable antibodies can be provided in a variety of structural configurations.

In an antibody molecule, the three hypervariable regions of a light chain and the three hypervariable regions of a heavy chain are disposed relative to each other in three dimensional space to form an antigen-binding surface. The antigen-binding surface is complementary to the three-dimensional surface of a bound antigen, and the three hypervariable regions of each of the heavy and light chains are referred to as \u201ccomplementarity-determining regions,\u201d or \u201cCDRs.\u201d The assignment of amino acids to each domain is in accordance with the definitions of Kabat Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md.

The term \u201cepitope\u201d includes any protein determinant capable of specific binding to an immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor. Epitopic determinants usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and usually have specific three dimensional structural characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. For example, antibodies may be raised against N-terminal or C-terminal peptides of a polypeptide.

The strength, or affinity of immunological binding interactions can be expressed in terms of the dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) of the interaction, wherein a smaller K<sub>d </sub>represents a greater affinity. Immunological binding properties of selected polypeptides can be quantified using methods well known in the art. One such method entails measuring the rates of antigen-binding site/antigen complex formation and dissociation, wherein those rates depend on the concentrations of the complex partners, the affinity of the interaction, and geometric parameters that equally influence the rate in both directions. Thus, both the \u201con rate constant\u201d (K<sub>on</sub>) and the \u201coff rate constant\u201d (K<sub>off</sub>) can be determined by calculation of the concentrations and the actual rates of association and dissociation.

In a typical assay, H292 cells or cynomolgus primary kidney epithelial cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of anti-CD166 antibody in PBS+2% FBS for 1 hr on ice. After washing 2\u00d7 with PBS+2% FBS, cells were incubated with a goat anti-human IgG secondary antibody, conjugated to AlexaFluor 647 (Jackson ImmunoResearch), for 30-45 min on ice. Cells were then washed 2\u00d7 with PBS+2% FBS and fixed with 1% formaldehyde.

In this assay, CD166-expressing HuT-78 cells are fluorescently labeled and incubated with recombinant CD6 protein immobilized on plastic plates. After several washes, bound HuT-78 cells are detected by measuring fluorescence and reported as a percentage of total fluorescence (before washing). MAB656 is an anti-CD166 mouse monoclonal antibody reported to inhibit cell adhesion in this assay (R&amp;D Systems), presumably by disrupting CD166 interaction with its receptor, CD6. In this exemplary assay, the anti-CD166 antibody of the present disclosure and MAB656 showed similar levels of inhibition of cell adhesion to CD6. Both antibodies showed nearly an EC50 of approximately 3.7 nM. An isotype control antibody showed no inhibition of cell adhesion.</p><heading id=\"h-0022\">Example 13.
