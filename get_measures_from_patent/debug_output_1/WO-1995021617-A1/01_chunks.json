    "7). </p> To those skilled in the art, it is known that the modulation of [<sup>35</sup>S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([<sup>35</sup>S]TBPS) binding is a measure of the potency and efficacy of drugs acting at the GR complex, which drugs may be of potential therapeutic value in the treatment of stress, anxiety, and seizure disorders (Squires, R.F., et al., \"[<sup>35</sup>S]t-Butylbicyclophophorothionate binds with high affinity to brain-specific sites coupled to a gamma aminobutyric acid-A and ion recognition site,\" Mol, Pharmacol., 25:326, 1983; Lawrence, L.J., et al., \"Benzodiazepine anticonvulsant action: gamma-aminobutyric acid-dependent modulation of the chloride ionophore, \" Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm., 123:1130-1137, 1984; Wood, et al. , \"In vitro characterization of benzodiazepine receptor agonists, antagonists, inverse agonists and agonist/antagonists,\" Pharmacol, Exp. Ther., 231:572-576, 1984). We performed several experiments to determine the nature of the modulation of [<sup>35</sup>S]TBPS as affected by the compounds of the invention. We found that these compounds interact with a novel site on the GR complex which does not \n\n overlap with the barbiturate, the benzodiazepine or any other previously known sites. Furthermore, these compounds have high potency and efficacy at the GR complex, with stringent structural requirements for such activity. Preferred compounds which are useful in the present invention have an IC<sub>50</sub> of 2 \u03bcM or less in the pSJTBPS binding assay described herein below. </p> The procedures for performing this assay are fully discussed in: (1) Gee, et al., 1987; and (2) Gee, K.W., L.J. Lawrence, and H.L Yamamura, \"Modulation of the chloride ionophore by benzodiazepine receptor ligands: influence of gamma-aminobutyric acid and ligand efficacy,\" Molecular Pharmacology 50:218, 1986. These procedures were performed as follows: </p> Brains from male Sprague-Dawley rats were removed immediately following sacrifice and the cerebral cortices dissected over ice. A P<sub>2</sub> homogenate was prepared as previously described (Gee, et al., 1986).</p>Briefly, the cortices were gently homogenized in 0.32 M sucrose followed by centrifugation at 1000 \u00d7 g for 10 minutes. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 9000 \u00d7 g for 20 minutes. The resultant P<sub>2</sub> pellet was suspended as a 10% (original wet weight/volume) suspension in 50 mM Na/K phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) 200 mM NaCl to form the homogenate. </p> One hundred microliter (ml) aliquots of the P<sub>2</sub> homogenate (0.5 milligrams (mg) protein) were incubated with 2 nanomolar (nM) [<sup>35</sup>S]TBPS</p>(70-110 curies/millimole;, New England Nuclear, Boston, MA) in the presence or absence of the namrally occurring steroids or their synthetic derivatives to be tested. The tested compounds were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (Baker Chem. Co., Phillipsbury, NJ) and added to the incubation mixture in 5 \u03bcL aliquots. The incubation mixture was brought t"
