    "otein interactions between PARI and various signaling partners. </p> Fig. 2A is a schematic representation of the structure of various hPARl constructs: wild-type hParl (wt), a truncated form (Truncated) representing the mutant hParl L369Z which lacks the entire cytoplasmic tail, and Y397Z, another hParl deletion mutant which exhibits persistent signaling due to impaired internalization. Fig. 2B demonstrates semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of cells transfected with various hParl constructs (wt-hP rl, Truncated, Y397Z, and control (empty vector)). Upper panel: PARj N-terminus, middle panel: C-terminus. All the tested cells expressed similar \n\n GAPDH levels. Fig. 2C is a graph demonstrating mouse mammary tumor growth in animals implanted with cells expressing wt hParl and variants. The graph demonstrates increase in tumor volume (mm , mean \u00b1 SD) with time, for each of the tested groups: wt hParl (\u25a0), Y397Z hParl (\u25a1), truncated hParl (\u0394), and empty vector (A tumor volume 30 \u00b1 3 mm * &lt;0.005). Fig 2D is a photograph of tissue sections taken from orthotopic mammary fat pad tumors generated by MCF7 cells over-expressing the various hParl constructs and stained with hematoxylin eosin (right panels). Magnification is xlOO. Upper panel: Vector, second panel from the top: Truncated, third panel from the top: wild-type, lower panel: Y397Z. </p> Fig. 3A is a photograph showing sections of tumors generated by various hParl constructs and subjected to immunohistochemical staining with Ki-67 (upper panel), and with either an endothelial cell-specific lectin (a-lectin, mid-panel) or anti-CD31 (lower panel). Fig. 3B is a graph showing the mean (\u00b1 SD) number of Ki-67-positive cells per high power field (HPF) as counted in five microscope fields per tumor section. Fig. 3C and Fig. 3D are graphs showing the mean (\u00b1 SD) number of anti-lectin- or anti- CD31 -stained cells, respectively, per high power field (HPF) as counted in five microscope fields per tumor section. Error bars show +/- SD of mean and the P value was determined (** PO.005 * PO.001 ; Chi- square test). The data are representative of four independent experiments performed in triplicates. </p> Fig. 4A shows Western blot analysis performed using anti-She antibodies, demonstrating binding of PARj GST-C-tail to She adaptor. Fig. 4B and 4C show co- immunoprecipitation analyses of PAR.<sub>!</sub> and She. Lysates of non-activated or TFLLRNPNDK-activated MDA-MB-435 cells were co-immunoprecipitated with either anti- PARi (4B) or anti-She (4C) antibodies. Fig 4D shows PARj binding to the Shc- SH2 domaia MDA-MB-435 cell lysates were loaded onto columns of GST-Shc-SH2, GST linked to a tandem SH2 from a non-relevant protein, or GST alone. Specifically- bound proteins were eluted and detected with anti- PARj antibodies. Fig 4E is a schematic representation of the structure of PARi -C-tail. IL-internal ligand; TM - transmembrane. Important tyrosine (Y) residues are indicated and the conserved sequence is highlighted. Fig 4F is a table showing analysis of PAR<sub>!</sub> C-tail Y-residues \n\n by NetPhos 2.0 server.

    "ing specific antibodies. </p>Histological evaluation and scoring: The combined histological results were assessed and scored as previously described (Groeger AM, et al. (2004) Histopathology 44:54- 63). The measurements per slide section were carried out using anatomical compartments, using an ocular micrometer (WHIOX2, Olympus, New Jersey, USA). Slides review was independently performed by two investigators (BM and RB). Discrepancies were resolved by simultaneous re-examination of the slides by both investigators using a double-headed microscope. The microscope was calibrated with a micrometer slide before each measurement. All measurements were performed on the monitor screen using a x40 objective. On examining the sections for selection of fields tumor cells from the most cellular area at the center of the tumor were selected. Necrotic and inflammatory area were avoided. Eight microscopic fields were screened, 10 cells/field were selected and no less than 50 cells /tumor case were assessed. The positive rate of staining is expressed as a mean + SD per tumor histological subtype from selected cases. </p> Immunohistochemistry. Sections were subjected to inactivation of endogenous peroxidase (3% H<sub>2</sub>0<sub>2</sub> in DDW), antigen retrieval by microwave oven (3 min) in citrate buffer (0.01 M, pH 6.0), and blocking with 10% goat serum in PBS. Sections were then incubated with antibodies directed against Von- Willebrand factor (anti-factor VIII, DAKO, Carpinteria, CA), Ki-67 (Clone SP6, Lab Vision-NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA), or an endothelial cell-specific lectin (Bandeiraea simplicifolia BS-1 isolation), followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA). Color was developed by incubation (10 min) with the Zymed AEC \n\n substrate kit (Zymed Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA), and counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin. </p> Preparation of hParl constructs: truncated hParl, Y397Z hParl, Y381A hParl and Y383A hParl. Detection of hParl was carried out using primers: sense orientation: 5'- CTCGTCCTCAAGGAGCAAAC-3 ' (SEQ ID NO: 29), antisense orientation: 5'- TGGGATCGGAACTTTCTTTG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 30). For the PAR.<sub>!</sub> -C-tail primers: sense orientation: 5' -TACTATTACGCTGGATCCTCTGAG-3 ' (SEQ ID NO: 31), antisense: 5'- (SEQ ID NO: 33). </p> Using polymerase chain reaction, a PAR-1 mutant protein truncated in its cytoplasmic tail after amino acid leucine 369 or at tyrosine 397 was constructed. Y397Z construct: PAR-1 cDNA served as a template for amplifying the fragment containing STOP codon using the followed primers: sense: 5'-ATA AGC ATT GAC CGG TTT CTG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 36) and antisense: 5 -GCT CTA GAT TTT AAC TGC TGG GAT CGG AAC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 37). Replacement of tyrosine residues at PARj cytoplasmic tail was achieved using specific primers containing the point mutation. Primer sequences were as follows: 381-sense: 5'-TGC CAG AGG GCT GTC TAC AGT ATC TTA TGC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 38), 381 -a",
    "LCC (named hParl-lK mutant) (SEQ ID NO: 43). For HA-tag wt hParl construct PCR primers were designed and added downstream to the ATG start codon. Primers for the HA-tag are as follows: sense: 5'- TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 44) and anti- sense: 5'-AGC GTA ATC TGG AAC ATC TA TGG GTA-3' (SEQ ID NO: 45). Replacement of seven residues with Ala (A) at positions 378-384 was made by \n\n synthesis of oligos containing the mutation. Primer sequences were as follows: hParl 7 A mutant: sense: 5'- TCT GAG GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCA GCT ATC TTA -3' (SEQ ID NO: 46) and anti-sense: 5'- TAA GAT AGC TGC AGC AGC AGC AGC AGC CTC AGA -3' (SEQ ID NO: 47). PCR products were then used as primers on an hParl cDNA template to create an extended product of introduced mutations into the full- length sequence. The amplified DNA fragment was digested with Pin AI and Xbal from PARi cDNA and cloned into pcDNA3-/zPari plasmid followed by DNA sequencing. GST-C-tail cloning. GST-C-tail of PARi fragment, containing 54 amino acids from serine 369 to residue 425, was prepared using RT-PCR (5'-TAC TAT TAC GCT GGA TCC TCT GAG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 48) and 5'-CTG AAT TCC TAA GTT AAC AGC TT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 49)). The resulting DNA fragment was further cut with the appropriate restriction enzymes (BamHl and EcoRl) and ligated into pGEX2T vector. The GST-C- tail was separated by SDS-PAGE, which indicated that the fusion protein of the C-tail was adequately prepared. The molecular weight of GST protein is 27 kD and the GST-C tail fusion protein is 32kD. GST-Shc-SH2 and tandem SH2 were kindly provided by S. Katzav, Hubert H. Humphrey Center for Experimental Medicine and Cancer Research, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem. </p> GST fusion protein columns. Fusion proteins were purified from transformed Escherichia coli bacteria that had been stimulated with isopropyl-P-D-thio- galactopyranoside (IPTG) at a concentration of 0.3 \u03bc\u039c. Bacteria were lysed according to published procedures, and then immobilized on glutathione Sepharose beads (Pharmacia). Briefly, MDA-MB-435 cell lysates were applied to GST- PARI C-tail or GST control columns. After 2h binding periods to the designated protein/s cell lysates to the columns, a washing step was performed. The washes (x3) were carried out using a \"wash buffer\" including: 100 mM NaCL, 20 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0 and 1% Triton xlOO. This step was performed in order to wash out all non-specific proteins, leaving the GST- PAR] -C-tail column firmly bound to targeted cell lysate proteins. Next, elution of bound proteins was performed via the addition of gel \"sample buffer\" and appropriate boiling. The samples were run electrophoretically on SDS-PAGE gels, followed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies and ECL detection. </p>GST-PH-Etk/Bmx. The PH domain in Etk/Bmx was bound to GST column as previously described (Chen R, et al. (2001) Nat Cell Biol. 3: 439-444). \n\n Purification of PARi C-tail fragments. PARj C-tail fr",
    "(except for the empty vector) expressed N-terminus PARI. As expected, only the cells that were transfected with wt hParl expressed the c- tail portion of PARI . The functional outcome of MCF7 cells over-expressing various hParl constructs in vivo was assessed by analyzing orthotopic mammary fat pad tumor development. MCF7 cells over-expressing either Y397Z or wt hParl constructs (e.g., MCF7/Y397Z hParl; MCF7/wt hParl) markedly enhanced tumor growth in vivo \n\n following implantation into the mammary glands (Fig. 2C and 2D), whereas MCF7 cells over-expressing truncated hParl behaved similar to control MCF7 cells in vector- injected mice, which developed only very small tumors (Fig. 2C). The tumors obtained with MCF7/wt hParl and MCF7/Y397Z hParl were 5 and 5.8 times larger, respectively, than tumors produced by the MCF7/empty vector-transfected cells. Histological examination (H&amp;E staining) showed that while both MCF7/wt hParl and MCF7/Y397Z hParl tumors infiltrated into the fat pad tissues of the breast, the MCF7/Y397Z hParl tumors further infiltrated the abdominal muscle (Fig. 2D). In contrast, tumors produced by empty vector or truncated z ri-transfected cells were capsulated, with no obvious cell invasion. In addition, the Y397Z hParl and wt hParl constructs exhibited intense vascularization and appeared reddish as opposed to the pale appearance of tumors generated by either empty vector or truncated hParl. </p>Proliferation levels were evaluated by immunostaining with Ki-67 and were 3 times higher in Y397Z hParl or wt hParl tumors (Fig. 3) than in the small tumors produced by either empty vector or truncated z ari-transfected cells (p&lt;0.0001, Fig. 3B). Tumor growth can also be attributed to blood vessel formation (Griffin CT, et al (2001) Science 293: 1666-1670; Connolly AJ, et al (1996) Nature 381 : 516-519). The hParl -induced breast tumor vascularization was assessed by immunostaining with anti-lectin- and anti- CD31 antibodies. Both MCF7/Y397Z and MCF7/wt hParl tumors were intensely stained (Fig. 3A, 3C and 3D). In contrast, only a few blood vessels were found in the small tumors of empty vector or truncated hParl (Fig. 3A, 3C and 3D). Thus, both MCF7/wt hParl and MCF7/Y397Z hParl cells were shown to effectively induce breast tumor growth, proliferation and angiogenesis, while the MCF7/truncated hParl and MCF7/empty vector-expressing cells had no significant effect. Histological evaluation and scoring was performed as described above. </p>PARi C-tail binds the She adaptor protein. To identify proteins that associate with the PARi C-terminus and participate in the tumor signaling pathway, the cytoplasmic tail of hParl was fused to a GST protein and used as \"bait\" to specifically detect associated proteins. Lysates obtained from a highly metastatic breast carcinoma line (e.g., MDA-MB-435 cells) were assessed for binding to the GST- PARi C-tail column. After an adequate binding period of the designated cell lysates to the columns, a wa"
