    "eby incorporated by reference in their entirety. </p>5.5 Albumin  Any albumin known to those of skill in the art may be used to form a conjugate according to the processes of the invention. In some embodiments, the albumin may be serum albumin isolated from a host species and purified for use in the formation of a conjugate. The serum albumin may be any mammalian serum albumin known to those of skill in the art, including but not limited to mouse, rat, rabbit, guinea pig, dog, cat, sheep, bovine, ovine, equine, or human albumin. In some embodiments, the albumin is human serum albumin. </p> While the processes of the invention can be utilized to form albumin conjugates comprising albumin from a number of sources, such as serum or a genomic source, the processes are particularly applicable to forming conjugates with recombinant albumin. The recombinant albumin may be any mammalian albumin known to those of skill in the art, including but not limited to mouse, rat, rabbit, guinea pig, dog, cat, sheep, bovine, ovine, equine, or human albumin. In a preferred embodiment, the recombinant albumin is recombinant human albumin, in particular, recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA). </p> Human serum albumin (HSA) is responsible for a significant proportion of the osmotic pressure of serum and also functions as a carrier of endogenous and exogenous ligands. In its mature form, HSA is a non-glycosylated monomeric protein of 585 amino acids, corresponding to a molecular weight of about 66 kD. Its globular structure is maintained by 17 disulfide bridges which create a sequential series of 9 double loops. See Brown, J. R., Albumin Structure, Function and Uses, Rosenoer, V. M. et al. (eds), Pergamon Press, Oxford (1977), the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Thus, conjugates formed with the mature form of albumin are within the scope of the processes described herein. </p> In some embodiments, conjugates formed by the processes of the invention comprise an albumin precursor. Human albumin is synthesized in liver hepatocytes and then secreted in the blood stream. This synthesis leads, in a first instance, to a precursor, prepro-HSA, which comprises a signal sequence of 18 amino acids directing the nascent polypeptide into the secretory pathway. Thus, conjugates formed with an albumin precursor are within the scope of the processes described herein. </p> In certain embodiments, conjugates formed by the processes of the invention comprise molecular variants of albumin. Variants of albumin may include natural variants resulting from the polymorphism of albumin in the human population. More than 30 apparently different genetic variants of human serum albumin have been identified by electrophoretic analysis under various conditions. See e.g., Weitkamp et al., Ann. Hum. Genet., 36(4):381-92 (1973); Weitkamp, Isr. J. Med. Sci., 9(9):1238-48 (1973); Fine et al., Biomedicine, 25(8):291-4 (1976); Fine et al., Rev. Fr. Transfus. Immunohe"
