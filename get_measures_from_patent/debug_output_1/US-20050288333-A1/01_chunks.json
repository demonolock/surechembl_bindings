Pharmacol., 1982, 22:554-564). Before use, the washed membranes were resuspended in 500-pt receptor binding assay saline (pH 7.40) consisting of 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>and 50 mM Tris-HCI. [<sup>3</sup>H]Cytisine (35 Ci/mmol)-binding displacement experiments were performed essentially according to Flores et al (1992), except that the incubation time was increased to 4 h at 0 to 4\u00b0 C. to ensure equilibrium during the competition binding assay. Binding of <sup>125</sup>I-BTX (136 Ci/mmol) was performed at 37\u00b0 C. for 3 h; the saline solution mentioned above also contained 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Nonspecific binding of each radioligand was measured in the presence of 1.0 mM nicotine (Marks and Collins, 1982). After incubation, membranes with bound radioligand were collected on Whatman CF/C glass fiber filters presoaked for 45 mm in 0.5% polyethylenimine and washed three times with 3.0 ml of ice-cold buffer by vacuum filtration on a harvester (Brandel, Gaithersburg, Md.). Bound [<sup>3</sup>H]cytisine was measured with use of a Biogamma counter (both from Beckman Coulter). Binding data were analyzed using Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, Calif.). All Ki values were calculated from the Cheng-Prusoff equation, using a K<sub>d </sub>value for each radioligand that had been experimentally determined under conditions identical with those of the displacement experiments. </p> The relative abilities of the compounds tested according to this method to interact with either rat brain \u03b14\u03b2<sub>2 </sub>or \u03b17 nicotinic receptors are shown in Table 1. The concentration of each radioligand was 1 nM. Each value (in nM) represents the mean\u00b1S.E.M. of values obtained from four (BTX) or three (cytisine) separate experiments. The K<sub>i </sub>(Ion) values are inhibitory concentrations of the ionized form of the compound and were calculated assuming that only the cationic ionized form interacts with the ACh binding site. Because cytisine binds preferentially to the desensitized form of the \u03b14\u03b2<sub>2 </sub>receptor, which routinely displays a several-hundred-fold higher affinity for ACh than the resting form, whereas BTX binds preferentially to the resting state of the \u03b17 receptor, these two sets of K<sub>i </sub>values are not comparable with each other because they were not obtained from equivalent states of these two receptors.  \nTABLE 1<sup>125</sup>I-BTX Binding[<sup>3</sup>H] Cytisine BindingCompoundK<sub>i </sub>\u00b1 S.E.M.K<sub>i(</sub>Ion)K<sub>i </sub>\u00b1 S.E.M.K<sub>i(</sub>Ion)DMXBA130 \u00b1 14\u200981253 \u00b1 371584-OH-MBA235 \u00b1 14\u200978\u200269 \u00b1 30232-OH-MBA317 \u00b1 67\u2009105387 \u00b1 251282,4-OH-BA203 \u00b1 5.0102206 \u00b1 16103\n</p> DMBXA competed with iodinated BTX for \u03b17 binding sites and with tritiated cytisine for predominately \u03b14\u03b2<sub>2 </sub>receptor binding sites in rat brain in a manner consistent with competitive antagonism. The Scatchard plots (not shown) for DMXBA inhibition of receptor binding by these two radioligands showed significant changes in slope but no significant changes in B<sub>max </sub>values. The mean Kd for <sup>125</sup>I-BTX binding, obtained from eight saturation experiments, was 0.32\u00b10.04 nM. The K<sub>i </sub>calculated for DMXBA inhibition of iodinated BTX binding in these saturation experiments was 173 nM. 2-OH-MBA and 4-OH-MBA inhibited the specific binding of both cytisine and BTX in a like manner (data not shown). The affinities of the four compounds for the \u03b17 receptor varied approximately 3-fold, with DMXBA showing the highest affinity for this nAChR subtype. When differences in ionization between compounds were accounted for, their affinities for this receptor varied less than 50%. Affinities for the \u03b14\u03b2<sub>2 </sub>receptor varied almost 4-fold, with 4-OH-MBA displaying the highest relative affinity. The predicted \u03b14\u03b2<sub>2 </sub>affinity of the ionized form of 4-OH-MBA was approximately 6-fold greater than for DMXBA monocation. </p>Example 3 Pharmacological Effects of DMXBA Metabolites Upon Rodent and Human Nicotine. Receptors Expressed in X. laevis Oocytes  The experimental protocols for obtaining concentration-response curves for the two metabolites, 2-OH-MBA and 2,4-OH\u2014BA, were identical with those described previously for 4-OH-MBA and DMBXA (Papke and Porter-Papke, Br. J Pharmacol, 2002, 137:49-61). Peak currents were measured for responses of \u03b14\u03b2<sub>2 </sub>receptors to agonist application, because desensitization of this receptor subtype was slow enough not to affect the concentration-response relation measured in this manner. Currents resulting from",
    " in ice-cold saline (pH 7.4) were incubated with [<sup>3</sup>H]-N-methylcarbamyl choline (<sup>3</sup>H\u2014MCC) for 60 minutes before being washed free of unbound radioligand with two rapid washes of the saline solution, using vacuum filtration. The glass filters used to collect the membranes for scintillation counting were pre-equilibrated with polyethyleneimine to reduce ligand binding by the filters. </p> Atropine sulfate at 12 \u03bcM was used to block muscarinic binding sites. Non-specific binding was assessed in the presence of 100 \u03bcM carbamylcholine. Thus, the K<sub>d </sub>values of the test compounds were determined by their ability to compete for [<sup>3</sup>H-acetyl]choline or <sup>3</sup>H\u2014MCC binding. The apparent K<sub>l </sub>values were calculated from the Cheng-Prusoff equation assuming a K<sub>d </sub>for [<sup>3</sup>H]\u2014MCC of 5 nM. Some representative compounds of Formula I were tested for their ability to displace [<sup>3</sup>H]\u2014MCC. Results are indicated in Table 3. The K<sub>l </sub>values presented in the table are mean values obtained from two separate experiments. Table 3 also shows data for binding of selected compounds of Formula I at the \u03b17 receptor as measured by displacement of iodinated \u03b1-bungarotoxin, as described in Example 2. In Table 3, \u201cNA.\u201d means that the data are not available. These results show that the compounds tested [with K<sub>i</sub>&lt;5] bind to rat brain synaptosome brain nicotinic receptors with high affinity.  \nTABLE 3Compound\u03b17 Ki (\u03bcM)\u03b1<sub>4</sub>\u03b2<sub>2 </sub>Ki (\u03bcM)GTS-20.570.32GTS-3NA.&gt;5GTS-52.3&gt;5GTS-70.360.025GTS-81.1&gt;5GTS-130.050.17GTS-15NA.1.6GTS-16NA.0.83GTS-20NA.4.0GTS-210.130.12GTS-23NA.&gt;5GTS-260.400.026GTS-27&gt;1033GTS-28&gt;103.8GTS-350.0580.17GTS-38&gt;102.0GTS-39NA.1.0GTS-401.50.5GTS-43NA.0.64GTS-44NA.0.80GTS-45NA.0.86GTS-48172.0GTS-510.321.5GTS-520.200.45GTS-53NA.4.5GTS-54N.A.1.0GTS-55NA.2.5GTS-56NA.0.25GTS-570.050.50GTS-58&gt;20&gt;5GTS-600.080.13GTS-63&gt;10&gt;5DMACA0.070.40\n</p>Example 5 Evaluation of Healing of Open Ischemic Wounds  Following the method of Canapp et al. (Vet Surg., 2003, 32(6):51 5-23), the effects of topically applied OMXBA (GTS-21), 2-OH-MBA (GTS-51), 2,4-OH\u2014BA (GTS52) and 4-OH-MBA (GTS-62) on healing in ischemic open wounds are evaluated. Forty-eight adult male Sprague-Dawley rats are divided into six groups: topical DMXBA, topical 2-OH-MBA, topical 2,4-OH\u2014BA, topical 4-OH-MBA, topical vehicle (hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose), and no treatment (control). Six-mm-diameter, full-thickness wounds are created within an ischemic bipedicle skin flap on the dorsum of each rat. Each day, for 13 days, wound margins are traced, and the test compound and vehicle groups are treated topically. Tracings are scanned and wound perimeter and area are calculated. On days 6, 10, and 13, selected wounds are biopsied and analyzed for tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 2 and 9. A significant decrease in wound area in any of the test compound groups, when compared ",
    "lpha, MMP-2 and MMP-9 in test-compound-treated wounds vs. control wounds also indicate test compound efficacy. </p>Example 6 Reduction of Angiogenesis in Mouse Tumor Model  Following the method of Siemann and Rojiani (Int J. Radiat Oncol Biol Phys., 2002, 54(5):1512-7), C3H/HeJ and NCR/nu-nu mice bearing intramuscular tumors are injected intraperitoneally with GTS-15 (0-150 mg/kg) or GTS-57 (0-150 mg/kg) either alone or in combination or with a vehicle control. Tumor response to treatment is assessed by clonogenic cell survival. The treated mice are assessed for damage to existing neovasculature. Histologic evaluation is also performed to assess dose-dependent morphologic damage of tumor cells within a few hours after drug exposure and after a period of time sufficient to allow for central tumor necrosis and neoplastic cell death as a result of prolonged ischemia. Data are analyzed by appropriate statistical methods to determine the anti-angiogenic or anti-neovascularization effects of the test compounds. </p>Example 7 Measurement of Alpha 7 Receptor Binding Selectivities  After decapitation, washed whole rat brain membranes (200 \u03bcg of protein) were prepared according to the method used by Marks and Collins(1982). Displacement of <sup>125</sup>I-labelled alpha-bungarotoxin (BTX) measured binding to alpha7 receptors; displacement of [<sup>3</sup>H]-labelled cytisine measured binding to alpha4beta2 receptors. Before use, the washed membranes were resuspended in 500 \u03bcl receptor binding assay saline (pH 7.4) consisting of 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>and 50 mM Tris-HCl. [<sup>3</sup>H]Cytisine (35 Ci/mmole)-binding displacement experiments were performed essentially according to Flores, et al. (1992), except that the incubation time was increased to 4 hr at 0 to 4\u00b0 C. to ensure equilibrium during the competition binding assay. Binding of <sup>125</sup>I-BTX (136 Ci/mmole) was performed at 37\u00b0 C. for 3 h; the saline solution mentioned above also contained 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Nonspecific binding of each radioligand was measured in the presence of 1.0 mM nicotine. After incubation, membranes with bound radioligand were collected on Whatman GF/C glass filber filters presoaked for 45 min in 0.5% polyethylenimine and washed three times with 3.0 ml of ice-cold buffer by vacuum filtration on a harvester (Brandel, Gaithersburg, Md.). Bound [<sup>3</sup>H] cytosine was measured in a liquid scintillation counter, whereas [<sup>125</sup>]BTX was measured with use of a Biogamma counter (both from Beckman coulter). Binding studies were analyzed using Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, Calif.). All Ki values were calculated from the Cheng-Prusoff equation, using a Kd value for each radioligand that had been experimentally determined under conditions identical with those of the displacement experiments. The alpha7 binding selectivity of each compound shown in Table 1 was estimated by dividing the Ki for aplha4beta2 binding by the Ki for alpha7 binding. The alpha7 binding selectivity of each compound was calculated by dividing the Ki for alpha4beta2 binding by the Ki for alpha7 binding. </p> All publications and patent applications mentioned in this specification are herein incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each individual publication or patent application were specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference. </p> The invention now being fully described, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that many changes and modifications can be made thereto without departing from the spirit or scope of the appended claims. </p> Other Embodiments </p> This description has been by way of example of how the compositions and methods of the invention can be made and carried out.
