Accordingly, another embodiment of the antibody of the present inventi",
    "tion is an antibody which substantially binds to all the P. aeruginosa strains of serotype E, but which does not substantially binds to any one of P. aeruginosa strains of the other serotypes, out of the P. aeruginosa strains identified by the ATCC accession numbers shown as examples above . </p> According to a preferred embodiment, the anti-serotype E LPS antibody of the present invention has an opsonic activity against P. aeruginosa. The anti-serotype E LPS antibody of the present invention can have an opsonic activity against a P. aeruginosa strain of serotype E, as a reflection of the binding activity to a P . aeruginosa strain of serotype E . In particular , \n\n the antibody \"1656\" and the antibody \"1640\" of the present invention each exhibited a high opsonic activity against a P. aeruginosa strain of serotype E . Particularly notably, when the opsonic activities of the antibody \"1656\" and the antibody \"1640\" of the present invention were evaluated by using the P. aeruginosa strain of serotype E (ATCC 29260) and by employing the detection method using, as an index, a fluorescence intensity of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes incorporating FITC- labeled P. aeruginosa, as described in the examples of the present application, the EC50s of \"the antibody \"1656\" and the antibody \"1640\" were 0.11 and 0.64 yg/ml , respectively. The anti- serotype E LPS antibody of the present invention preferably has such an excellent opsonic activity, and is, for example, an antibody of which EC50 of opsonic activity against the P. aeruginosa strain of serotype E (ATCC 29260) is 1 ug/ml or less</p>(for example, 0.8 \u03bcg/ml or less, 0.6 g/ml or less, 0.4 g/ml or less, or 0.3 yg/ml or less, 0.2 g/ml or less). </p> Moreover, when the opsonic activity of the anti-serotype E LPS antibody of the present invention is evaluated by using the P. aeruginosa strain of serotype E (ATCC 29260) and by employing the detection method using, as an index, a fluorescence intensity of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes incorporating FITC- labeled P. aeruginosa, as described in the examples of the present application, the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) value of the anti-serotype E LPS antibody at 30 yg/ml is preferably not less than 0.5 times (for example, not less than \n\n 0.8 times, not less than 1 time or not less than 1.2 times) the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) value of Venilon at 1000 pg/ml . </p> According to another preferred embodiment, the anti -serotype E LPS antibody of the present invention has an agglutination activity against P. aeruginosa. The antibody</p>\"1656\" of the present invention showed an excellent agglutination titer per amount (yg) of IgG 190, when the P. aeruginosa strain of serotype E (ATCC 29260) was used. Because of having such an excellent agglutination activity, the anti -serotype E LPS antibody of the present invention used as a medicine can induce an efficient opsonic activity even in a low dose, and hence an effect of infection prevention can be a",

Thereafter, as complements, baby rabbit serum ( 10 \u03bc\u0390) and the PMN ( 40 \u03bc\u0390 , 2 <sup>\u03c7</sup> 10<sup>5</sup> cells) were added, and the mixture was further incubated for 3 0 minutes to carry out phagocytosis . The plate was transferred onto ice, and thereby the reaction was stopped. The fluorescence of bacteria attaching to the cell surfaces was quenched by PBS containing</p>0 . 2 % trypan blue ( 100 \u03bc\u0390) , and then the cells were fixed with 0 . 5 % paraformaldehyde. Using a flow cytometer (BECKMAN COULTER) , the fluorescence (mean fluorescence intensity, hereinafter abbreviated as MFI) of the cells was measured. The opsonic activity was calculated as a value obtained by subtracting the fluorescence intensity due to the intrinsic fluorescence of the PMN from the fluorescence intensity of PMN which incorporated the FITC-labeled P. aeruginosa strain. </p> As a result, for the serotype E strain ATCC 2 92 6 0 , the MFI value of a group to which no antibody was added was 0 . 32 , and the MFI value of a group to which the anti -serotype E LPS \n\nantibody 1656 was added increased concentration-dependently, where the MFI value was 122.87 at 30 \u03bcg/ml, and the EC50 was 0.11 \u03bc9/\u03c0\u03b91. The MFI value of an immunoglobulin preparation, Venilon (TEIJIN PHARMA LIMITED) , which was used as a control, was 97.77 at 1000 yg/ml . </p> The above-described results showed that the anti-serotype E LPS antibody 1656 had a strong opsonic activity against a strain of serotype E, which is clinically frequently encountered. -Test 2-</p>The serotype E P. aeruginosa strain ATCC 29260 was cultured on a Mueller-Hinton agar medium overnight. Then, 3 colonies were picked up therefrom, inoculated in a Luria-Bertani culture medium, and cultured at 37 \u00b0C for 16 hours with shaking (180 rpm) . The culture medium was subjected to centrifugation (2,000 <sup>\u03c7</sup> g,</p>10 minutes, at room temperature) . The resultant material was washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) , and then suspended in a 1 mM solution of fluorescein-4-isothiocyanate (FITC) at room temperature for 1 hour to perform labeling. By a density gradient centrifugation method using a Mono-Poly resolving medium (DS Pharma Biomedical Co. Ltd.), human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (hereinafter, referred to as PMN) were purified from 50 ml of blood collected using citric acid from healthy donors, and were prepared to have a concentration of 5xl0<sup>6</sup> cells/ml . 20 \u03bc\u0390 of the anti-serotype E LPS antibody</p>1640 and the FITC-labeled P. aeruginosa strain (30 \u03bc\u0390 , 5 <sup>\u03c7</sup> 10<sup>s</sup>) \n\nwere added in a 96 -well round-bottom plate, and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 15 minutes. Thereafter, as complements, baby rabbit serum (10 \u03bc\u0390) and the PMN (40 \u03bc\u0390, 2 <sup>\u03c7</sup> 10<sup>5</sup> cells) were added, and the mixture was further incubated for 30 minutes to carry out phagocytosis. The plate was transferred onto ice, and thereby the reaction was stopped. The fluorescence of bacteria attaching to the cell surfaces was quenched by PBS containing 0.2% trypan blue (100 \u03bc\u0390) , and then the cells were fixed with 0.5% paraformaldehyde. Using a flow cytometer (BECKMAN COULTER) , the fluorescence (mean fluorescence intensity, hereinafter abbreviated as MFI) of the cells was measured. The opsonic activity was calculated as a value obtained by subtracting the fluorescence intensity due to the intrinsic fluorescence of the PMN from the fluorescence intensity of PMN which incorporated the FITC- labeled P. aeruginosa strain. </p> As a result, for the serotype E P. aeruginosa strain ATCC 29260, the MFI value of a group to which no antibody was added was 0.44, and the MFI value of a group to which the antibody 1640 was added increased concentration-dependently, where the MFI value was 58.37 at 30 ug/ml, and the EC50 was 0.64 \u03bcg/ml .</p>The MFI value of an immunoglobulin preparation, Venilon (TEIJIN PHARMA LIMITED) , which was used as a control, was 27.07 at 1000 ug/ml . </p> The above-described results showed that the anti-serotype E LPS antibody 1640 had an opsonic activity against a P. aeruginosa strain of serotype E. \n\n (7) Effect on Systemic Infection Model 1 </p> Neutropenic mice were prepared as follows. Cyclophosphamide (Sigma-Aldrich) was intraperitoneally injected into each 6 -week-old BALB/c male mouse (Charles river laboratories Japan, inc. , n=6) at 125 mg/kg three times in total on days -5, -2 and 0, where the day of infection was designated as day 0. Thereby, neutrophils in the peripheral blood were decreased. Into the mouse, the ATCC 29260 strain (serotype E/Oll) suspended in 250 \u03bc\u0390 of saline was inoculated intraperitoneally at 1.8 <sup>\u03c7</sup> 10<sup>3</sup> cfu/mouse (approximately 46 LD50) , to thereby induce a systemic infection. Immediately thereafter, the anti-serotype E LPS antibody 1640 was administered via tail vein at 200 \u03bc\u0390/mouse, and a protective activity against the infection was judged on the basis of the survival thereof 7 days after the inoculation. As a result, the survival rates, on day 7 after the infection, of control groups to which an immunoglobulin preparation, Venilon (TEIJIN PHARMA LIMITED) , was administered at 5 , 50, 500 and 2500 pg/mouse were 0, 16.7, 33.3 and 66.7%, respectively, and the ED50 was estimated to be</p>985.22 \u03bcg/mouse .
