    "or use in the present invention include compositions wherein the active ingredient(s) is/are contained in an effective amount to achieve the intended purpose. More specifically, a therapeutically effective amount means an amount effective to prevent development of or to alleviate at least one of the existing symptoms of the subject being treated. Determination of the effective amounts is well within the capability of those skilled in the art.</p>In embodiments, the effective dose of the compound(s) used in accordance with the present invention inhibits cellular senescence or propagation of cellular senescence (through the SASP) sufficiently to reduce or prevent at least one symptom or physiological effect associated with cellular senescence in diseases and conditions described herein (e.g., ocular vascular diseases and other diseases and conditions described herein). Certain compounds which have such activity can be identified by in vitro assays that determine the dose-dependent inhibition of SASP and/or IRE1a.</p>Alternatively, in other embodiments. the effective dose of the compound(s) used in accordance with the present invention is sufficient to induce or increases the SASP and cause cellular senescence.</p>For any compound used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cellular assays. For example, a dose can be formulated in cellular and animal models to achieve a circulating concentration range that includes the IC50 as determined in cellular assays (i e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of the cellular signaling function of SASP and/or IRE1a, (usually in response to inflammatory mediators such as 11-11 or other activating stimulus such as hypoxia, ischemia, cellular stress, ER stress).</p>A therapeutically effective amount refers to that amount of the compound that results in amelioration of symptoms in a subject. Similarly, a prophylactically effective amount refers to the amount necessary to prevent or delay symptoms in a patient (e.g., vascular hyperpermeability, spotted and/or blurry vision, pericytes loss, macular edema, retinal swelling, blood retinal barrier leakage, pathological neovascularization, reduced vascular repair, etc.). Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the ED (effective dose for 50% maximal response). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio between MTD and ED50. Compounds which exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred. The exact formulation, route of administration and dosage can be chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient's condition.</p>Dosage amount and interval may be adjusted individually to provide levels of the active compound which are sufficien",

Conditioned medium were collected after 60-72 hrs of growth in serum free media and cleared from cellular debris by swing bucket centrifugation (2000 RPM, 20 minutes). FC traps were purified from conditioned media of transfected 293T cells by passage on Protein A or G sepharose (Pharmacia) followed by extensive washes with PBS and elutions with 0.1 M glycine pH 3.0. Elution fractions were neutralised immediately by the addition of 1/10 volume 1 M Tris pH 8 and 1/10 volume of 10\u00d7PBS pH 7.4.</p>Soluble 6\u00d7HIS tagged traps were purified from conditioned media of transfected 293T cell by passage on Talon agarose (Clontech) followed by extensive washes with PBS and stepwise imidazole elutions (Range 10-150 uM typically). Samples of purification fractions of traps were analysed on 5-15% or 5-20% gradient PAGE-SDS gels. Gel were stained using the Safely Blue staining kit (InVitrogen).</p>Sterile formulation of purified traps for in vivo injections. Purifications elution fractions from 40 ml of conditioned media were pooled and diluted to a total volume of 10 ml in PBS. Diluted trap proteins were sterilized by filtration through a 0.2 uM low protein binding filter (Progene). Protein solutions were concentrated and buffer exchanged with PBS on sterile PES concentration devices (Pierce, nominal MWCO 30 KD). Sterile concentrated Traps samples (\u02dc30-50 ul) were analysed and stained on PAGE-SDS as described above.</p>Example 9Affinity of Traps for SEMA3AProduction of AP-VEGF<sub>165</sub>. the coding sequence of the human VEGF165 variant 1 (NM_001025366) was sub-cloned in the pAPtag5 vector (GenHunter), in-frame with an Alkaline Phosphatase domain (AP-VEGF165).</p>HEK293T cells were transfected with the AP-VEGF165 construct using a polyethylenimine (PEI) transfection method. Following the overnight transfection step, cells were cultured for an additional 60 hr in serum free media (In vitrogen). The cell media were collected and concentrated on a PES device (Pierce). The concentrated AP-VEGF165 ligand was analysed on PAGE-SDS and quantified using SimplyBlue safe stain (Life technologies).</p>Sema 3A and AP-VEGF<sub>165 </sub>binding assays. Saturation curves for the determinations of KD of binding to SEMA 3A or VEGF165 were obtained as follow. Wells of high protein binding 96 well plates (Maxisorp, Nunc) were coated with purified traps diluted in PBS and blocked afterward with binding buffer (PBS containing 2% casein and 0.05% Tween 20). The SEMA3A-FC (R&amp;D systems) or AP-VEGF165 ligands were diluted in binding buffer over an extensive range of concentrations and added to wells. Following an overnight incubation, wells were washed with PBS containing 0.05% tween. Bound SEMA3a-FC was detected using an HRP-linked anti-Human IgG (Biorad) and ECL substrate (Pierce). Alternatively, bound AP-VEGF165 was detected using CPD star substrate (Roche). The Chemiluminescent signal was acquired on a TECAN reader. Dissociation constant (KD) were determined by non-linear curve fitting using the Graph Pad prism software.</p>The relative affinity of traps of the present invention to SEMA3A and VEGF has been assessed. Traps were prepared as described in Example 8. Schematic representation of traps tested (without HIS or FC tags) is also provided in FIG. 18.</p>TABLE 6Dissociation constant of SEMA3A and VEGF for various trapsSEMA 3A-FCVEGF165 bindingNRP1 Trapbinding (nM)(nM)G0.8\u20026.75O1.05N.D.M0.9520.13N&gt;1000&gt;250\u2009\u2003\u2003R6.15N.D.W1.1420.73Y&gt;750N.D.Z4.4466.96ABN.D.29.51AC4No bindingQNo bindingN.D.PNo bindingN.D.XNo bindingN.D.SN.D.24.6\u2002ADNo bindingNo bindingAENo bindingNo bindingAFNo bindingN.D.AJ2.4N.D.Ak4.4N.D.</p>The soluble NRP1 traps tested generally bind more efficiently to SEMA3A than VEGF. Such preference for SEMA3A was found surprising since SEMA3A and VEGF are considered to normally have the same general affinity for NRP1. Applicants have also surprisingly found that introduction of a mutation at position 297 (Y297A) in NRP1 not only inhibits binding to VEGF but also to NRP1. Such mutation was previously though to be associated with Increased affinity for SEMA3A may be advantageous in conditions where SEMA3A inhibition is preferred over inhibition of VEGF. As inhibition of VEGF using VEGF inhibitors such as bevacizumab has been suggested to induce cellular senescence in colorectal cancer cells in vitro and in vivo (Hasan et al., 2011 Int. J. Cancer 1; 129(9):2115-2123), the use of NRP1 traps having a reduced affinity for VEGF may be preferred in the context of senescence associated diseases and conditions. Furthermore, NRP1 traps preferably interacting with Sema3a over VEGF are expected to show reduced side effects associated with inhibition of VEGF cell signaling.</p>Example 10Attenuation of Cellular Senescence by NRP1 TrapsMice subjected to OIR were intravitreally injected with NRP1 traps G or M or with vehicle at P12 and retinas were monitored for cellular senescence. As shown in FIG. 20, quantification of SA-\u03b2-gal staining of P17 OIR flatmount retinas reveals a significant attenuation of cellular senescence when mice receive a single injection of Trap M or Trap G, with Trap M being more effective in inhibiting cellular senescence. Interestingly, Trap M, has a kd for SEMA3A which is about 20\u00d7 greater than for VEGF, while the preference for SEMA3A for trap G is much less important (see Table 6).</p>Example 11Experimental ProceduresAnimals.
