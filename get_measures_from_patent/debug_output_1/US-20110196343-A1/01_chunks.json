    "ow cells bind to Angptl2. 5\u00d710<sup>4 </sup>positively stained cells and the same number of negatively stained cells were transplanted together with 2\u00d710<sup>5 </sup>CD45.1 competitor cells into lethally irradiated CD45.1 mice (n=4-5). Peripheral blood cells were analyzed for the presence of CD45.2<sup>+</sup> cells in lymphoid and myeloid compartments at 3 weeks and 4 months after transplant.</p>In the experiment shown in FIG. 12B, adult CD45.2 bone marrow cells were cultured in serum-free medium with SCF, TPO, IGF-2, and FGF-1 as described (Reya, T. et al. Nature 423, 409-14 (2003)) for 4 days. The cells were then stained with Flag-Angptl2\u2014containing medium (\u02dc1 \u03bcg/ml Flag-Angptl2) as the same as described in FIG. 3. 5.3% of total cells bind to Angiopoietin-FLAG. 1300 positively stained cells and 8000 negatively stained cells were transplanted together with 2\u00d710<sup>5 </sup>CD45.1 competitor cells into lethally irradiated CD45.1 mice (n=4). Peripheral blood cells were analyzed for the presence of CD45.2<sup>+</sup> cells in lymphoid and myeloid compartments at 3 weeks and 3 months after transplant.</p>Angptl2 and Angptl3 Stimulate ex vivo Expansion of HSCs</p>A plasmid containing the entire coding sequence for human Angptl2 with a FLAG tag fused at the C-terminus in the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1(\u2212) (FLAG-Angptl2) was constructed. Following transient transfection of 293T cells, the culture supernatant contained secreted FLAG-Angptl2 migrating with the expected \u02dc60 kD size (FIG. 1). As shown herein, the majority of freshly isolated LT-HSCs and all LT-HSCs cultured for 4 d bound this hormone (FIG. 12).</p>In the experiment shown in FIG. 2, twenty CD45.2 bone marrow SP Sca-1<sup>+</sup> CD45<sup>+</sup> cells were seeded into each well of a 96-well U-bottom plate, in serum-free conditioned medium collected from mock transfected 293T cells (S/F: serum-free medium, SCF: serum-free medium with 10 ng/ml SCF, S+T: serum-free medium with 10 ng/ml SCF and 20 ng/ml TPO, S+T+I+F: serum-free medium with 10 ng/ml SCF, 20 ng/ml TPO, 20 ng/ml IGF-2, and 10 ng/ml FGF-1), or in serum-free conditioned medium from 293T cells transfected with Flag-Angptl2 (S/F+Angptl2: serum-free medium with \u02dc100 ng/ml Angptl2, S+A: serum-free medium with 10 ng/ml SCF and \u02dc100 ng/ml Angptl2, S+T+A: serum-free medium with 10 ng/ml SCF, 20 ng/ml TPO, and \u02dc100 ng/ml Angptl2, S+T+I+F+A: serum-free medium with 10 ng/ml SCF, 20 ng/ml TPO, 20 ng/ml IGF-2, 10 ng/ml FGF-1, and \u02dc100 ng/ml Angptl2). Images shown were taken after 3 days of culture, under a phase-contrast microscope.</p>A representative of two independent experiments (FIG. 3A) shows that Angptl2 is a stimulator of ex vivo expansion of LT-HSCs. In this study Angptl2 was not purified but was contained in the conditioned medium of 293T cells transfected with a FLAG-Angptl2 expression vector; conditioned medium from mock-transfected cells served as a negative control.
