C9 Inhibitory Oligonucleotides (IO)C9 inhibitory oligonucleotides (oligonucleotides that reduce C9 expression) include any oligonucleotide that is sufficiently complementary a gene or mRNA encoding C9 so that it binds to it and significantly reduces expression of the C9 gene and/or production of the mRNA or protein, preferably the C9orf72 gene or C9ORF72 protein. Such C9 IOs include, for example, isolated small hairpin RNA (shRNA), small interfering RNA (siRNA), antisense RNA, antisense DNA, chimeric antisense DNA/RNA, microRNA, and ribozymes. A significant reduction in C9, as it pertains to this invention is a reduction of at least 30%. Therefore, \u201cknock-down\u201d or \u201cKD\u201d of C9 refers to a significant reduction of C9 mRNA or protein expression.</p>Certain embodiments of the present invention are directed to the use of C9 KD agents, such as antisense nucleic acids or small interfering RNA (siRNA) or short hairpin RNA (shRNA), to reduce or inhibit expression of a targeted C9 gene and hence the biological activity of the targeted C9 protein. Based on the known sequences of the targeted C9 proteins and genes encoding them, antisense DNA or RNA that are sufficiently complementary to the respective gene or mRNA to turn off or reduce expression can be readily designed and engineered, using methods known in the art. In a specific embodiment of the invention, antisense or siRNA molecules for use in the present invention are those that bind under stringent conditions to the targeted mRNA or targeted gene encoding a C9 protein as identified by the GenBank numbers NM 001256054, 203228, or to variants or fragments that are substantially homologous to the mRNA or gene encoding C9 protein. The antisense compounds of the invention are synthesized in vitro and do not include antisense compositions of biological origin.</p>Methods of making inhibitory oligonucleotides such as antisense nucleic acids are well known in the art. The invention comprises methods of reducing the expression of C9 protein and mRNA in cells (e.g. cancer cells) by contacting the cells, in situ or contacting isolated enriched populations of the cells or tissue explants in culture, with one or more of the antisense compounds or C9 KD agents or with any other inhibitory oligonucleotide of the invention. According to embodiments of the invention, a suitable target nucleic acid encompasses DNA encoding a C9 protein and RNA (including pre-mRNA and mRNA) transcribed from such DNA. The specific hybridization of a complementary or substantially complementary nucleic acid oligomer with its target nucleic acid interferes with the normal function of the target nucleic acid.</p>This modulation of function of a target nucleic acid by compounds which specifically hybridize to it is generally referred to as \u201cantisense.\u201d The functions of DNA to be reduced or \u201cinterfered with,\u201d by antisense or any other inhibitory oligonucleotide, include its replication and its transcription. The functions of RNA to be reduced or \u201cinterfered with\u201d include all vital functions such as, for example, translocation of the RNA to the site of protein translation, translation of protein from the RNA, and any catalytic activity which may be engaged in or facilitated by the RNA. The overall effect of such interference with target nucleic acid function is modulating or reducing the expression of the protein encoded by the DNA or RNA. In the context of the present invention, \u201cmodulation\u201d means reducing or inhibiting in the expression of the gene or mRNA for a C9 protein.</p>In certain embodiments of the invention, targeting includes choosing a site or sites within the target DNA or RNA encoding the C9 protein for the antisense interaction to occ",
    "ative start codons, any one of which may be preferentially utilized for translation initiation in a particular cell type or tissue, or under a particular set of conditions. In the context of the invention, \u201cstart codon\u201d and \u201ctranslation initiation codon\u201d refer to the codon or codons that are used in vivo to initiate translation of an mRNA molecule transcribed from a gene. Routine experimentation will determine the optimal sequence of the antisense or siRNA. The terms \u201cstart codon region\u201d and \u201ctranslation initiation codon region\u201d refer to a portion of such an mRNA or gene that encompasses from about 25 to about 50 contiguous nucleotides in either direction (i.e., 5\u2032 or 3\u2032) from a translation initiation codon.</p>It is also known in the art that a translation termination codon (or \u201cstop codon\u201d) of a gene may have one of three sequences, i.e., 5\u2032-UAA, 5\u2032-UAG and 5\u2032-UGA (the corresponding DNA sequences are 5\u2032-TAA, 5\u2032-TAG and 5\u2032-TGA, respectively). Similarly, the terms \u201cstop codon region\u201d and \u201ctranslation termination codon region\u201d refer to a portion of such an mRNA or gene that encompasses from about 25 to about 50 contiguous nucleotides in either direction (i.e., 5\u2032 or 3\u2032) from a translation termination codon.</p>The open reading frame (ORF) or \u201ccoding region,\u201d which is known in the art to refer to the region between the translation initiation codon and the translation termination codon, is also a region which may be targeted effectively for interference or hybridization of a C9 KD agent. Other target regions include (1) the 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032UTR), known in the art to refer to the portion of an mRNA in the 5\u2032 direction from the translation initiation codon, and thus including nucleotides between the 5\u2032 cap site and the translation initiation codon of an mRNA or corresponding nucleotides on the gene, and (2) the 3\u2032 untranslated region (3\u2032UTR), known in the art to refer to the portion of an mRNA in the 3\u2032 direction from the translation termination codon, and thus including nucleotides between the translation termination codon and 3\u2032 end of an mRNA or corresponding nucleotides on the gene.</p>It is also known in the art that variants of mRNA can be produced through the use of alternative signals to start or stop transcription and that pre-mRNAs and mRNAs can possess more than one start codon or stop codon. Variants that originate from a pre-mRNA or mRNA that use alternative start codons are known as \u201calternative start variants\u201d of that pre-mRNA or mRNA. Those transcripts that use an alternative stop codon are known as \u201calternative stop variants\u201d of that pre-mRNA or mRNA. One specific type of alternative stop variant is the \u201cpolyA variant\u201d in which the multiple transcripts produced result from the alternative selection of one of the \u201cpolyA stop signals\u201d by the transcription machinery, thereby producing transcripts that terminate at unique polyA sites.</p>In a specific embodiment, a C9 inhibitory oligonucleotide is either SEQ ID NO:631 or SEQ ID NO:632 provided in Table 1, below.</p>TABLE\u20031C9\u2003Inhibitory\u2003Oligonucleotides.SequenceGene\u2003Namesense\u2003(5\u2032-3\u2032)\u2003S1antisense\u2003(5\u2032-3\u2032)\u2003S2C9orf72-UUAAUGAAACAAUAAUCACUCGUGAUUAUUGUUUCAUUAAUC1/siBothSEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u2003631SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u2003632</p>Other embodiments provided herein relate to an isolated siRNA molecule (C9 IO) comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO:631, SEQ ID NO:632, or fragments thereof. Also provided herein is a composition that includes a combination of a C9 IO and a PARP inhibitor, and optionally a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Other compositions disclosed herein include a combination of a C9 IO and an anti-C9 polyclonal or monoclonal antibody.</p>Once one or more target sites have been identified, nucleic acids are chosen or synthesized to be complementary or substantially complementary to the target to hybridize sufficiently well and with sufficient specificity, to give the desired effect of inhibiting gene expression and transcription or mRNA translation.</p>While antisense nucleic acids are one form of a C9 KD agent, the present invention comprises using other oligomeric antisense compounds, including but not limited to oligonucleotide mimetics. The antisense compounds useful for C9 KD may comprise from about 8 to about 50 nucleobases (i.e., from about 8 to about 50 linked nucleosides). Typically, antisense compounds are antisense nucleic acids comprising from about 12 to about 30 nucleobases. Antisense compounds include ribozymes, external guide sequence (EGS) nucleic acids (oligozymes), and other short catalytic RNAs or catalytic nucleic acids which hybridize to the target nucleic acid and modulate its expression. Nucleic acids in the context of this invention include \u201coligonucleotide,\u201d which refers to an oligomer or polymer of ribonucleic acid (RNA) or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or mimetics thereof. This term includes oligonucleotides composed of naturally-occurring nucleobases, sugars and covalent internucleoside (backbone) linkages as well as oligonucleotides having non-naturally-occurring portions which function similarly. Such modified or substituted oligonucleotides are often preferred over native forms because of desirable properties such as, for example, enhanced cellular uptake, enhanced affinity for nucleic acid target and increased stability in the presence of nucleases.</p>Antisense nucleic acids have been employed as therapeutic moieties in the treatment of disease states in animals and man. Antisense nucleic acid drugs, including ribozymes, have been safely and effectively administered to humans and numerous clinical trials are presently underway. Thus, nucleic acids can be useful therapeutic modalities that can be configured to be usefu",
    "., hammerhead ribozymes as described in Haselhoff and Gerlach, Nature 334:585-591, 1988) can be used to catalytically cleave targeted mRNA transcripts thereby inhibiting translation. A ribozyme having specificity for a targeted-encoding nucleic acid can be designed based upon the nucleotide sequence of its cDNA. For example, a derivative of a Tetrahymena L-19 IVS RNA can be constructed in which the nucleotide sequence of the active site is complementary to the nucleotide sequence to be cleaved in the targeted mRNA. See, e.g., Cech et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,987,071; and Cech et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,116,742. Alternatively, a targeted C9 mRNA can be used to select a catalytic RNA having a specific ribonuclease activity from a pool of RNA molecules. See, e.g., Bartel and Szostak, Science 261:1411-1418, 1993.</p>Other IO that can be used to inhibit a targeted gene or mRNA such as C9 include miRNAs.

MethodsUnited States Patent Publication No. 2004/0023390, teaches that double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) can induce sequence-specific posttranscriptional gene silencing in many organisms by a process known as RNA interference (RNAi). However, in mammalian cells, dsRNA that is 30 base pairs or longer can induce sequence-nonspecific responses that trigger a shut-down of protein synthesis and even cell death through apoptosis. RNA fragments are the sequence-specific mediators of RNAi. Interference of gene expression by these small interfering RNA (siRNA) is now recognized as a naturally occurring strategy for silencing genes in C. elegans, Drosophila, plants, and in mouse embryonic stem cells, oocytes and early embryos.</p>In mammalian cell culture, a siRNA-mediated reduction in gene expression has been accomplished by transfecting cells with synthetic RNA nucleic. United States Patent Publication No. 2004/0023390, provides exemplary methods using a viral vector containing an expression cassette containing a pol II promoter operably-linked to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a small interfering RNA molecule (siRNA) targeted against a gene of interest.</p>A typical mRNA produces approximately 5,000 copies of a protein. RNAi is a process that interferes with or significantly reduces the number of protein copies made by an mRNA. For example, a"
