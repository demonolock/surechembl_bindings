    "de can be selected for use in preparing a peptide derivative of the present invention useful to treat or prevent a condition or disorder in a subject in need of such treatment or prevention.</p>A candidate parent peptide may also be selected from a library. A library of peptides of 8, 9, 10 or 11 contiguous residues of the target antigen is constructed by any convenient method known in the art such as, e.g., by routine solid phase synthesis methods. The library may be of uniform size or mixed. Preferably the library is a \u201ccomplete library\u201d consisting of all possible such peptides of a specific size. The size of a library depends upon the length of the target protein and the length of the library's peptides. For example, a complete library of 10-mers of a 250-residue target will contain 240 peptides. A representative library consisting of at least a tenth of the members of the complete library can also be used. The library may be \u201cedited\u201d to exclude certain peptides such as those that might cause chemical instability (e.g., those containing cysteines and methionines), or that would be practically insoluble.</p>After the library is constructed, peptides having intermediate to moderately weak affinity for MHCI are identified as candidate parent peptides for further analysis. Parent peptides will preferably have a MHCI binding affinity value above 50 nM, but preferably below 50 uM as discussed above. Different screening methods can be used including the competition-based peptide-binding assay and the cell-based binding assay using TAP deficient cells. However, if the binding affinity ranges are used to select peptides, it will be important to use the same peptide binding assay or to run sufficient controls to correlate the results from the alternative assay with the competition-based peptide-binding assay cited herein.</p>Candidate parent peptides may also be known peptides chosen on the basis of published binding data or on the basis of analysis using an algorithm, or both, as noted above.</p>Once a peptide is identified as a candidate parent peptide for modification, a modified peptide can be constructed by substituting an amino acid residue at an anchor position in the peptide with a non-natural amino acid (e.g., conformation constraining non-natural amino acid), and the modified peptide tested for extent of cross-reactivity by the activated T-cells on the desired target cell. If a wild type residue at an anchor position is the most highly conserved residue, then the replacement may be selected from among non-natural amino acids chemically similar to the most highly conserved residue. If the wild type residue at the anchor position is not the most highly conserved residue, then it may be replaced with non-natural amino acids chemically similar to the most highly conserved residue. For example, a parent peptide may be a HLA-A2 peptide with an amino acid other than Leu at P2. A peptide derivative of this parent peptide may be a peptide that contains a non-natural peptide that is chemically similar to Leu, such as \u03b1-methyl leucine at P2. A peptide derivative prepared according to the method of, and suitable for practicing the present invention preferably displays an affinity value of less than 500 nM, and more preferably less than 50 nM to increase the likelihood",

Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from animal model test systems, including transgenic animal models.</p>The following examples further describe the materials and methods used in carrying out the invention. The examples are not meant to limit the invention in any manner.</p>5. EXAMPLES5.1. Affinity and Stability of HLA-A201/Peptide ComplexesModified peptides were tested for their ability to bind to and stabilize the HLA-A0201 molecule using one of two assays: (i) a live cell/flow cytometry-based assay; or (ii) a soluble class I/plate based-assay. E.g., Sharma et al., J. Biol. Chem. 276:21443-49 (2001); Pogue et al., PNAS 92:8166-70 (1995).</p>I. Live Cell/Flow Cytometry-Based AssaysRelative Binding Affinity. The live cell/flow cytometry-based assay is a well-established assay utilizing the TAP-deficient hybridoma cell line T2 (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC Accession No. CRL-1992), Manassas, Va.). The TAP deficiency in this cell line leads to inefficient loading of MHCI in the ER and an excess of empty MHCIs. Salter and Cresswell, EMBO J. 5:943-49 (1986); Salter, Immunogenetics 21:235-46 (1985). Empty MHCIs are highly unstable, and are therefore short-lived. When T2 cells are cultured at reduced temperatures, empty MHCIs appear transiently on the cell surface, where they can be stabilized by the exogenous addition of MHCI-binding peptides. To perform this binding assay, peptide-receptive MHCIs were induced by culturing aliquots of 10<sup>7 </sup>T2 cells overnight at 26\u00b0 C. in serum free AIM-V medium alone, or in medium containing escalating concentrations (0.1 to 100 uM) of peptide. Cells were then washed twice with PBS, and subsequently incubated with a fluorescent tagged HLA-A0201-specific monoclonal antibody, BB7.2, to quantify cell surface expression. Samples were acquired on a FACS Calibur instrument (Becton Dickinson) and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) determined using the accompanying Cellquest software.</p>The specific increase in mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) was used as a measure of peptide binding, and was calculated as follows:</p>MFI with modified peptide/MFI without peptide\u00d7100\n</p>The relative efficiency with which a peptide stabilizes an MHCI at the surface of these cells is used as a measure of relative binding affinity. To determine the relative binding affinity, maximal binding was determined using the influenza matrix<sub>58-66 </sub>peptide as a control, which peptide has been shown to bind to HLA-A0201 with high affinity. The relative binding affinity for each test peptide was taken as the concentration of the test peptide at which 50% maximal binding occurs.</p>Assessment of Peptide/HLA-A0201 Complex Stability.</p>Aliquots of 10<sup>7 </sup>T2 cells were cultured overnight at 26\u00b0 C. in serum-free AIM-V medium alone, or in medium containing peptide at a concentration of 100 uM.
