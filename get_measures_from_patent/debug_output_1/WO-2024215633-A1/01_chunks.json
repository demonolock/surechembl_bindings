    " samples followed by targeted peptide sequencing (Peptides International/B ioSynth (Louisville, KY); Alphalyse (Palo Alto, CA)). The MRM LC-MS/MS method was also used to confirm the concentration of proUGN in human serum samples as an independent method of measurement of the biomarker. To determine the concentration of proUGN in a serum sample, a standard curve was constructed with the calibrator proUGN by plotting absorbance values vs. known proUGN \n\nconcentrations of standards. Quantitative results were calculated with a robust linear regression model (log-transformed, 5-parameter curve fit). The mAb-based sandwich ELISA for circulating proUGN has a limit of detection of 2.0 pg/mL, detection range of 20 pg/mL to 2000 pg/ml, intraassay precision of &lt;3.0% and intra-assay precision of &lt;4.9%. The assay has high specificity for detection of proUGN in human serum with no cross -reactivity or interference between structurally similar analogs or guanylate cyclase activator proteins. Each serum sample measured for circulating proUGN was performed in duplicate or triplicate and results presented are representative of the mean of 3-6 experiments \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). </p>[0076] Table 1 immediately below is the serum prouroguanylin (proUGN) levels by CKD Stage using the immunological assay (ELISA) disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication No. </p>2021/0263047.
