    "f PDK1 kinase inhibitors in PC3 cells</p>The cellular assay for determining PDK1 kinase activity is performed as a 96-well Luminex assay. PC3 cells are seeded at 20,000 cells per well in 100 \u03bcM medium (45% RPMI1460 / 45% Ham's F12 / 10% FCS) and serum-free the following day for 30 min with a serial dilution of the test substance (7 concentrations)</p>\u00a0Conditions incubated. The cells are then treated with 90 \u03bcl lysis buffer (20 mM Tris / HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 10% glycerol, 1%</p>Phosphatase inhibitor I, 1% phosphatase inhibitor II, 0.1% protease inhibitor cocktail III, 0.01% benzonase) per well, and the lysates are centrifuged through a 96-well filter plate (0.65 \u03bcm). separated from insoluble cell components. The lysates are incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0 C with Luminex beads, to which an anti-total PKB antibody is coupled, with shaking. The next day, the detection is carried out by adding a phospho-T308-PKB antibody and a species-specific peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody. Phospho - T308 - PKB is detected by measurement in the Luminex100 device by determination of 100 events per cavity in 60 sec measurement time. As a pharmacological blank, the signals obtained from cells treated with 10 \u03bc\u039c staurosporine are subtracted from all other mixtures. As a control value of maximum phosphorylation of PKB on T308, the signals from cells treated with the solvent alone (0.3% DMSO) are used. Values of the test substance treated batches are calculated as percent of control and IC50 values are determined by RS1.  Above and below, all temperatures are given in \u00b0 C.
