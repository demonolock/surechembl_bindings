    ", for example. </p> [0095] Figures 5 and 6 illustrate method comparison data between CENTAUR\u00ae</p>XP and IMMULITE\u00ae 2000 dose values, using a CENTAUR\u00ae full curve method and the \n\n 2-point data fitting calibration method, respectively. In particular, Figures 5 and 6 show method comparison data of the prototype ADVIA CENTAUR\u00ae IGFBP-3 assay as compared to the predicate device, IMMULITE\u00ae 2000 IGFBP-3 assay, when tested on the same samples of human serum comprising unknown concentrations of nr-IGFBP-3 (wherein the sample size is n = 32 samples of human serum). For the prototype ADVIA CENTAUR\u00ae IGFBP-3 assay, concentration values of nr-IGFBP-3 were calculated using either a full-curve calculation (Figure 5), or for Figure 6, using a 2-point calibration using a Low calibrator (BL7 Cal L = 0.48 \u03bcg/ml) and High calibrator (BL7 Cal H = 11.00 \u03bcg/ml). The standards, BL7S01 to BL7S07, in Figures 5-6 were generated using ammonium sulfate as the anti-chaotropic precipitation agent and using ultrafiltration or a TFF process on BRT human serum. </p>Examples 3A-3B: Scale up of nr-IGFBP-3 enrichment using ammonium sulfate in a sodium phosphate solution </p> [0096] Saturated ammonium sulfate solution was mixed with equal volume of</p>BRT1 serum for the precipitation. The process was scaled up from 100 ml to 1000 ml human serum. A sodium phosphate aqueous solution (about 50-52 mM) was used for the saturated ammonium sulfate solution. Table 3 summarizes yields based on the prototype CENTAUR\u00ae IGFBP-3 binding assay. One liter each of BRT1 human serum was processed with different equipment, as described below for Example 3A and Example 3B.</p>Example 3A: </p> [0097] The human serum was handled using the equipment described in Example</p>1 above. </p> Example 3B: </p> [0098] The human serum was precipitated by 50% saturated ammonium sulfate in sodium phosphate solution and was centrifuged using an ADVANTI\u2122 Centrifuge model J-20XPI from Beckman Coulter; and the buffer exchange into PBS/sodium azide was done by a Tangential Flow Filter (TFF) by Scilog, equipped with a TFF cassette (cat no. OS030T12) from Pall Corporation, Port Washington, NY. Final reduction of about 800 ml down to 200 ml was done on an AMICON\u00ae Stirred Cell. A detailed summary of yields from Examples 1, 2 and 3A-B are summarized in Table 3. \n\n [0099] Table 3 shows that the prototype CENTAUR\u00ae IGFBP-3 binding assay is configured to support larger scale batch size processing with consistent or increasing higher percent yield of nr-IGFBP-3 (Examples 3A-3B at 1000 ml BRT volume). Further, Table 3 shows that the stronger anti-chaotropic agent, i.e., ammonium sulfate, used for precipitating the nr-IGFBP-3, produced higher yields than did the sodium sulfate, was compatible with the larger scale processing, and performed well (to precipitate out the nr- IGFBP-3) whether mixed in water or mixed a solution of sodium phosphate in water and filtered/buffer exchanged using an ultrafiltration system or TFF system. The yield of nr- IGFBP-3 was highest in Example 3B, that used ammonium sulfate in a sodium phosphate solution with 1 liter of human serum (1 : 1 ratio) for precipitation and TFF system for separation, buffer exchange and concentration of the nr-IGFBP-3. </p>Table 3: Percent yields after sodium sulfate and ammonium sulfate precipitation </p><img id=\"imgf000035_0001\" path=\"imgf000035_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/396611246/WO/20170706/A1/002017/11/72/36/imgf000035_0001.tif\"/></p>Example 4: nr-IGFBP-3 Purification and enrichment using Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography (HIC) </p> [0100] Example 4 was carried out using a porous matrix of sepharose-based resin in a HIC chromatography column using Phenyl Sepharose 6FF.
