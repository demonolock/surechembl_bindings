{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences/rows that meet the criteria:\n\n\nFor the prototype ADVIA CENTAUR\u00ae IGFBP-3 assay, concentration values of nr-IGFBP-3 were calculated using either a full-curve calculation (Figure 5), or for Figure 6, using a 2-point calibration using a Low calibrator (BL7 Cal L = 0.48 \u03bcg/ml) and High calibrator (BL7 Cal H = 11.00 \u03bcg/ml). \n\n\nNote: There is only one sentence that contains a specific molecule name (nr-IGFBP-3), a bioactivity metric (concentration), a specific numeric value (0.48 \u03bcg/ml and 11.00 \u03bcg/ml), and a unit (\u03bcg/ml). However, it's worth noting that the bioactivity metric in this sentence is not a typical metric like IC50 or Ki, but rather a concentration value. If you're looking for sentences with typical bioactivity metrics, there are none in the provided text snippet."}
