    "cell and/or HPC are produced to actively any material of impact to the migration in the marrow being masked.</p>In another embodiment, method described herein also provides following steps: in being exposed to the marrow being masked of the main body radiation, carry out marrow extraction, utilize cell factor to make in vitro candidate stem cell and the CFU-GM of survival increase, the cell increasing is introduced to main body again.</p>In another embodiment, method described herein also provides the step that main body is given to the compound of energy stimulating immune system.In another embodiment, method described herein also provides the step that main body is given to the immunostimulatory cell factor, such as but not limited to excellent Bao Jin (Neupogen).In another embodiment, method described herein also provides the step that main body is given to Filgrastim (Filgrastim).In another embodiment, method described herein also provides the step that main body is given to granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF).In another embodiment, method described herein also provides the step that main body is given to interleukin 2, IL-4, interleukin-11.</p>In another embodiment, method described herein also provides the step that main body is given to antidote.In another embodiment, method described herein also provides the step that main body is given to radioactivity antidote.In another embodiment, method described herein also provides the step that main body is given to KI, calcium trisodium pentetate, Pentetic Acid zinc sodium or its any combination.</p>Embodiment</p>Embodiment 1</p>For determining desirable complete attenuation (A\n        <sub>d</sub>) method:\n      </p>Desirable complete attenuation can be according to the application target of device and different.If be intended for use to relate in long radioactive exposure, desirable complete attenuation should be higher.Such configuration is applicable to the first response person who stays disaster area.If use for short-term, desirable complete attenuation should be lower.Such configuration is applicable to the individual who withdraws from disaster area.Regardless of desired use, desirable complete attenuation should be all to make the survival volume of enlivening marrow be enough to allow postradiation hematopoietic reconstitution.According to a large amount of transplantations of bone marrow, this volume is 23 to 58cm\n        <sup>3</sup>enliven marrow, specifically depend on Individual Size.From the knowledge of the radiosensitivity of mankind hemopoietic stem cell and CFU-GM (for example; referring to J.S.Senn and E. A. McCulloch; Blood January 1; 1970 vol. 35 no. 1 56-60) and the volume that enlivens marrow protected by radioprotector, it should be that deducibility goes out desirable complete attenuation for what value.Following formula can be used for this purpose:\n      </p></p>a<sub>d</sub>=desirable complete attenuation\n      </p>d<sub>u</sub>=not protected dose of radiat"
