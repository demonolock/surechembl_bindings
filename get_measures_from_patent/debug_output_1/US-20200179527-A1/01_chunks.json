    "resent invention (including nucleic acid nucleic acid targeting moieties and/or functional RNAs to be delivered, e.g., RNAi-inducing entities, ribozymes, tRNAs, etc., described in further detail below) may be prepared according to any available technique including, but not limited to chemical synthesis, enzymatic synthesis, enzymatic or chemical cleavage of a longer precursor, etc. Methods of synthesizing RNAs are known in the art (see, e.g., Gait, M. J. (ed.) Oligonucleotide synthesis: a practical approach, Oxford [Oxfordshire], Washington, D.C.: IRL Press, 1984; and Herdewijn, P. (ed.) Oligonucleotide synthesis: methods and applications, Methods in molecular biology, v. 288 (Clifton, N.J.) Totowa, N.J.: Humana Press, 2005).</p>The nucleic acid that forms the nucleic acid nucleic acid targeting moiety may comprise naturally occurring nucleosides, modified nucleosides, naturally occurring nucleosides with hydrocarbon linkers (e.g., an alkylene) or a polyether linker (e.g., a PEG linker) inserted between one or more nucleosides, modified nucleosides with hydrocarbon or PEG linkers inserted between one or more nucleosides, or a combination of thereof. In some embodiments, nucleotides or modified nucleotides of the nucleic acid nucleic acid targeting moiety can be replaced with a hydrocarbon linker or a polyether linker provided that the binding affinity and selectivity of the nucleic acid nucleic acid targeting moiety is not substantially reduced by the substitution (e.g., the dissociation constant of the nucleic acid nucleic acid targeting moiety for the target should not be greater than about 1\u00d710<sup>\u22123 </sup>M).</p>It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that nucleic acids in accordance with the present invention may comprise nucleotides entirely of the types found in naturally occurring nucleic acids, or may instead include one or more nucleotide analogs or have a structure that otherwise differs from that of a naturally occurring nucleic acid.

Nos. 6,403,779; 6,399,754; 6,225,460; 6,127,533; 6,031,086; 6,005,087; 5,977,089; and references therein disclose a wide variety of specific nucleotide analogs and modifications that may be used. See Crooke, S. (ed.) Antisense Drug Technology: Principles, Strategies, and Applications (1st ed), Marcel Dekker; ISBN: 0824705661; 1st edition (2001) and references therein. For example, 2\u2032-modifications include halo, alkoxy and allyloxy groups. In some embodiments, the 2\u2032-OH group is replaced by a group selected from H, OR, R, halo, SH, SR, NH2, NHR, NR2 or CN, wherein R is C1-C6 alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl, and halo is F, Cl, Br, or I. Examples of modified linkages include phosphorothioate and 5\u2032-N-phosphoramidite linkages.</p>Nucleic acids comprising a variety of different nucleotide analogs, modified backbones, or non-naturally occurring internucleoside linkages can be utilized in accordance with the present invention. Nucleic acids of the present invention may include natural"
