    "ividuals from the effects of over-use or over-loading their musculoskeletal system during: for instance existing inventions describe collagen and glucosamine and chondroitin based treatments for rheumatoid, osteoarthritic, multiple sclerosis and related \u201cdefective\u201d conditions.</p>It is non-obvious that previously disclosed disease treatments would be effective for temporary musculoskeletal distress the composition and method jointly provide a previously undisclosed \u201cdual action\u201d musculoskeletal preservation and restoration system whereby both autoimmune function (via T cell regulation) is induced using native and insoluble type II collagen, and simultaneously bone resorption and tissue reparation effects of the metal salts and/or vitamins and amino acids. Such an approach has not been previously been reported to the author's knowledge at the time of writing in contrast to the present invention, related dietary supplements often intentionally hydrolyze the type II collagen (for examples, existing inventions disclose where the collagen is hydrolyzed) or otherwise alter the collagen protein (through another existing invention: the collagen is hydrolyzed and then used to bind calcium, which further alters the protein structure); using a type II collagen source that is not-hydrolyzed and retains its native structure is essential to the present invention and is responsible for the unique mechanisms by which it is effective; the method of obtaining a type II collagen of at least 50 KD and from an acceptable source is not obvious, as this protein is difficult to extract from appropriate sources.</p>Functional Uses of the Invention:The present invention is unique when compared with many dietary supplement compositions because the present invention provides:</p>(1) In one example embodiment, a very small and effective dose of under 50 milligrams per serving per day, and a maximum of 1000 milligrams per serving. By contrast examples of hydrolyzed collagen report 500 milligrams in existing inventions for soluble hydrolyzed collagen, or 250 milligrams for glucosamine sulphate. (These inventions have different uses than the composition reported here and are only used to illustrate quantitative differences).</p>Commercial materials have traditionally used doses of over 1500 milligrams per day, obtaining treatments with a high impact at doses lower than those previously used are not obvious.</p>(2) In another example embodiment, the invention is a unique method for maintaining or improving healthy musculoskeletal function for healthy active humans and animals during intense periods of activity distress or workout routines and;</p>(3) In yet another example embodiment, compositions of the invention act by a dual mechanism of action that is distinct from traditional dietary supplements for bone or joint troubles.</p>In one embodiment, the present invention is a composition to be consumed orally as a dietary supplement or other edible composition for reducing or re"
