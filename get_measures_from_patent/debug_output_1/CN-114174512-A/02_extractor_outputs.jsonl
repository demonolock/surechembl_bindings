{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n1. When the concentration was reduced to 1nM, as shown in fig. 3, it was confirmed that 14 sequences out of the total 36 base sequences inhibited PD-1mRNA expression with an efficiency of 50% or more at a concentration of 1nM.\n2. As a result of screening a total of 36 base sequences, 25 sequences were confirmed to inhibit the expression of PD-1mRNA by 50% or more at a concentration of 10nM, as shown in FIG. 2.\n3. In particular, from the results of IC50 measurements for asiRNA having a gene suppression efficiency of 80% or more, it was confirmed that the IC50 of asiPD-1-93 and asiPD-1-95 was the lowest.\n4. Then, 36 asiRNAs were transfected at 1nM or 10nM using RNAimax (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol (Table 1).\n5. Then, 1nM of 3 asiRNAs (asiPD-1-89, asiPD-1-93, asiPD-1-95) were transfected using RNAimax (Invitrogen) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer."}
