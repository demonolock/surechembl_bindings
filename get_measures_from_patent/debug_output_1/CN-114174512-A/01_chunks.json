    "efore transfection were seeded into 12-well plates. Then, 36 asiRNAs were transfected at 1nM or 10nM using RNAimax (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol (Table 1). After 24 hours, total RNA was extracted using Tri-RNA reagent (FAVORGEN), and 500ng of RNA was used for cDNA synthesis. cDNA was synthesized using a high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Then, qRT-PCR was performed on the synthesized cDNA using a StepOne real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). PD-1 expression of asiRNA transfected samples against untreated samples (NT) was converted to percentages using the primers and SYBR green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) of table 2 (fig. 2(10nM), fig. 3(1 nM)). Tubulin was used as a housekeeping gene (table 2).</p>[ TABLE 2 ]</p></p>The experiments were performed 3 times independently, and the gene inhibition efficiency of asiRNA against 36 sequences targeting PD-1mRNA is shown in FIG. 2(10nM) and FIG. 3(1 nM). This value represents the mean \u00b1 sd of independent experiments. As a result of screening a total of 36 base sequences, 25 sequences were confirmed to inhibit the expression of PD-1mRNA by 50% or more at a concentration of 10nM, as shown in FIG. 2. When the concentration was reduced to 1nM, as shown in fig. 3, it was confirmed that 14 sequences out of the total 36 base sequences inhibited PD-1mRNA expression with an efficiency of 50% or more. In particular, from the results of IC50 measurements for asiRNA having a gene suppression efficiency of 80% or more, it was confirmed that the IC50 of asiPD-1-93 and asiPD-1-95 was the lowest. Among them, asiPD-1-89 was also selected as a candidate group for chemical modification and self-delivery (self-delivery) experiments.</p>1.4. Confirmation of protein expression-inhibiting effects by quantifying PD-1 protein levels of 3 asiRNAs</p>According to the screening results of 36 kinds of asiRNAs, two most effective types (asiPD-1-93 and asiPD-1-95) were selected from airRNAs with gene suppression efficiency of 80% or more, asiPD-1-89 was selected, and after transfection was performed at a concentration of 1nM, the PD-1 protein level was confirmed by human programmed death 1(PD-1) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Mybiosource).</p>Specifically, HeLa-PD-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's Medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and 0.2g/L of hygromycin B (hygromycin B) to a 100mm cell culture dish. HeLa-PD-1 cells cultured 24 hours before transfection were seeded into 12-well plates. Then, 1nM of 3 asiRNAs (asiPD-1-89, asiPD-1-93, asiPD-1-95) were transfected using RNAimax (Invitrogen) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The medium was changed to fresh medium 24 hours after transfection and passaged again 48 hours later with 12-well plates (passage). After 96 hours, cell lysates were prepared by harvesting (harvest) using 5X RIPA (in-house) buffer. Following quantification by BCA assay (Pierce), PD-1 protein levels were confirmed using the human programme"
