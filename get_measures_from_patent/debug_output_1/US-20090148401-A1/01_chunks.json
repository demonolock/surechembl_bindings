In specific embodiments, the macromolecule of a carrier construct of the invention has a high association constant. In certain embodiments, a dissociation constant or K<sub>d </sub>(k<sub>off</sub>/K<sub>on</sub>) for antibody is about 5\u00d710<sup>\u22121 </sup>M or less, about 10<sup>\u22121 </sup>M or less, about 5\u00d710<sup>\u22122 </sup>M or less, about 10<sup>\u22122 </sup>M or less, about 5\u00d710<sup>\u22123 </sup>M or less, about 10<sup>\u22123 </sup>M or less, about 5\u00d710<sup>\u22124 </sup>M or less, about 10<sup>\u22124 </sup>M or less, about 5\u00d710<sup>\u22125 </sup>M or less, about 10<sup>\u22125 </sup>M or less, about 5\u00d710<sup>\u22126 </sup>M or less, about 10<sup>\u22126 </sup>M or less, about 5\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M or less, about 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>M or less, about 5\u00d710<sup>\u22128 </sup>M or less, about 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M or less, about 5\u00d710<sup>\u22129 </sup>M or less, about 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>M or less, about 5\u00d710<sup>\u221210 </sup>M or less, or about 10<sup>\u221210 </sup>M or less.</p>In particular embodiments, the macromolecule of the carrier construct is chosen because delivery of a particular macromolecule-binding partner complex(es) to a subject is desired. For example, in certain embodiments, a delivery construct is used to deliver a macromolecule-binding protein complex to a subject, wherein the macromolecule is growth hormone (GH) binding protein and binding partner is growth hormone (GH). GH that is circulated in the blood of a subject is found associated with a binding proteins such as GH binding protein. Thus, the delivery of a GH-GH binding protein complex mimics the GH found in circulating blood. Further, the GH-GH binding protein complex increases the half-life of GH in the subject.",
    " moiety that emits photons when excited with light of appropriate wavelength and a quencher moiety that absorbs such photons when in close proximity to the fluorescent moiety. Cleavage of the probe separates the quenching moiety from the fluorescent moiety, such that fluorescence can be detected, thereby indicating that cleavage has occurred. Thus, such probes can be used to identify and assess cleavage by particular cleaving enzymes by contacting the basolateral side of a monolayer of suitable epithelial cells with the probe under conditions that allow the cleaving enzyme to cleave the probe. The amount of fluorescence observed indicates the activity of the cleaving enzyme being tested.</p>5.11.2. Proper Folding of the Carrier Construct</p>To determine that a carrier construct has properly folded and is able to bind to a binding partner, an immunoassay can be performed. For example, an ELISA can be performed. Such an ELISA may comprise: coating a 96 well plate with a binding partner of interest, adding the carrier construct to the well and incubating for a period of time, and detecting the binding of the binding partner to the carrier construct. To detect the binding, a second detectably labeled antibody that recognizes the carrier construct can be added to the well.</p>5.11.3. Binding Affinity of Macromolecule</p>The binding affinity of a macromolecule of a carrier construct for a binding partner can be determined by competitive binding assays. One example of a competitive binding assay is a radioimmunoassay that involves incubation of labeled binding partner (e.g., <sup>3</sup>H or <sup>125</sup>I) with the carrier construct of interest in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled binding partner, and the detection of the carrier construct bound to the labeled binding partner. The affinity of the macromolecule of the carrier construct for the binding partner and the binding off-rates can be determined from the saturation data by scatchard analysis. Competition with a second binding partner can also be determined using radioimmunoassays.</p>In a preferred embodiment, BIAcore kinetic analysis is used to determine the binding on and off rates of binding partner to a carrier construct. BIAcore kinetic analysis comprises analyzing the binding and dissociation of a carrier construct from chips with immobilized binding partners on their surface.</p>5.11.4. Activity of Delivery Construct</p>The delivery constructs and compositions of the invention are preferably tested in vitro, and then in vivo for the desired therapeutic or prophylactic activity, prior to use in humans. For example, in vitro assays which can be used to determine whether administration of a specific delivery construct or a composition of the present invention is indicated, include in vitro cell culture assays in which a subject tissue sample is grown in culture, and exposed to or otherwise administered the delivery construct or composition of the present invention, and the effe"
