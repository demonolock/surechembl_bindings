    "l-length antibody genes were constructed by first synthesizing the variable region sequences. The sequences were optimized for expression in mammalian cells. These variable region sequences were then cloned into expression vectors that already contain human Fc domains; for the heavy chain, the IgG1 was used.</p>Small scale production of humanized antibodies was carried out by transfecting plasmids for the heavy and light chains into suspension HEK293 cells using chemically defined media in the absence of serum. Whole antibodies in the conditioned media were purified using MabSelect SuRe Protein A medium (GE Healthcare).</p>Nine humanized antibodies were produced from each combination of the three heavy chains having the amino acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NO: 29, 31 and 33 and three light chains having the amino acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NO: 35, 37 and 39. A comparative chimeric parental antibody was also prepared. The antibodies and their respective titers are shown below in Table 7:</p>TABLE 7Antibody titersAntibodyTiter (mg/L)Chimeric parental23.00SEQ ID NO: 29 + SEQ ID NO: 3524.67SEQ ID NO: 29 + SEQ ID NO: 3741.67SEQ ID NO: 29 + SEQ ID NO: 3929.67SEQ ID NO: 31 + SEQ ID NO: 3526.00SEQ ID NO: 31 + SEQ ID NO: 3727.33SEQ ID NO: 31 + SEQ ID NO: 3935.33SEQ ID NO: 33 + SEQ ID NO: 3544.00SEQ ID NO: 33 + SEQ ID NO: 3730.33SEQ ID NO: 33 + SEQ ID NO: 3937.33</p>The binding of the humanized antibodies may be evaluated, for example, by dose-dependent binding ELISA or cell-based binding assay.</p>Example 6 (Prophetic): An AGE-RNAse Containing Vaccine in a Human SubjectAGE-RNAse is prepared by incubating RNAse in a phosphate buffer solution containing 0.1-3 M glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, fructose or ribose for 10-100 days. The AGE-RNAse solution is dialyzed and the protein content is measured. Aluminum hydroxide or aluminum phosphate, as an adjuvant, is added to 100 \u03bcg of the AGE-RNAse. Formaldehyde or formalin is added as a preservative to the preparation. Ascorbic acid is added as an antioxidant. The vaccine also includes phosphate buffer to adjust the pH and glycine as a protein stabilizer. The composition is injected intravenously into a subject with influenza.</p>Example 7 (Prophetic): Injection Regimen for an AGE-RNAse Containing Vaccine in a Human SubjectThe same vaccine as described in Example 6 is injected intra-articularly into a subject with SARS-CoV. The titer of antibodies to AGE-RNAse is determined by ELISA after two weeks. Additional injections are performed after three weeks and six weeks, respectively. Further titer determination is performed two weeks after each injection.</p>Example 8 (Prophetic): An AGE-Hemoglobin Containing Vaccine in a Human SubjectAGE-hemoglobin is prepared by incubating human hemoglobin in a phosphate buffer solution containing 0.1-3 M glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, fructose or ribose for 10-100 days. The AGE-hemoglobin solution is dialyzed and the protein content is measured. All vaccine components are the sam"
