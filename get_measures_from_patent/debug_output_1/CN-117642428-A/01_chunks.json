    " acid residues from a non-human HVR and amino acid residues from a human FR. Typically, the heavy and/or light chain comprises one or more CDRs (including, if desired, one or more modified CDRs) of a donor antibody (e.g., a non-human antibody such as a murine or rabbit monoclonal antibody) and is grafted into the heavy and/or light chain variable region framework of a recipient antibody (human antibody) (see, e.g., vaughan et al, nature Biotechnology,16,535-539,1998). Such humanized antibodies have the advantage of reduced immunogenicity to humans while maintaining the specificity and affinity of the parent non-human antibody. Instead of the entire CDR being transferred, only one or more of the specificity-determining residues from any of the CDRs described herein above may be transferred to the human antibody framework (see, e.g., kashmiri et al 2005, methods,36, 25-34). \"humanized\" antibody refers to a chimeric antibody comprising amino acid residues from a non-human HVR and amino acid residues from a human FR. An antibody, such as a \"humanized version\" of a non-human antibody, refers to an antibody that has undergone humanization. </p>The term \"hypervariable region\" or \"HVR\" as used herein refers to each of the regions of an antibody variable domain that are hypervariable in sequence (\"complementarity determining regions\" or \"CDRs\") and/or form structurally defined loops (\"hypervariable loops\") and/or comprise antigen-contacting residues (\"antigen contacts\").</p>The term \"IC50\" as used herein refers to the half maximal inhibitory concentration, which is a measure of the effectiveness of a substance, such as an antibody, in inhibiting a particular biological or biochemical function. IC50 is a quantitative measure that indicates how much particular substance is required to inhibit a given biological process by 50%.</p>\"identity\" between amino acids in a sequence indicates that at any particular position in the aligned sequences, the amino acid residues are identical between the sequences.</p>The term \"IgG-scFv\" as used herein is a full-length antibody having an scFv at the C-terminus of each heavy chain or each light chain.</p>The term \"IgG-V\" as used herein is a full length antibody having a variable domain on the C-terminus of each heavy chain or each light chain.</p>The term \"IgG1 LALA\" or \"hIgG1 LALA\" refers to mutants of wild-type human IgG1 isotypes in which the amino acid substitution L234A/L235A in the constant region of IgG1 has been introduced. </p>The term \"IgG4P\" or \"hIgG4P\" refers to a mutant of the wild-type human IgG4 isotype in which amino acid 228 (numbering according to EU) is replaced by proline, as described, for example, in Angal et al, molecular Immunology,1993,30 (1), 105-108.</p>Throughout this specification, the term \"isolated\" means that an antibody, or polynucleotide, as the case may be, is present in a physical environment that is different from the environment in which it may occur in nature. The term \"isolated\" nucleic acid refers to a nucleic acid molecule that has been isolated from its natural environment or has been created synthetically. The isolated nucleic acid may comprise synthetic DNA (e.g., produced by chemical treatment), cDNA, genomic DNA, or any combination thereof.</p>The term \"Kabat residue name\" or \"Kabat\" refers to the residue numbering scheme commonly used for antibodies. This is not always directly consistent with the linear numbering of amino acid residues. The actual linear amino acid sequence may comprise fewer or additional amino acids than in the strict Kabat numbering, which corresponds to a shortening of, or insertion into, the structural components of the basic variable domain structure, whether framework regions or Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs). For a given antibody, the correct Kabat numbering of residues may be determined by alignment of residues with homology in the sequence of the antibody with a \"standard\" Kabat-numbered sequence. For details, see Kabat et al Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5 th edition, public Health Service, national Institutes of Health, bethesda, MD (1991). Unless otherwise indicated, kabat numbering is used throughout the specification. </p>The term \"KD\" as used herein refers to the dissociation constant obtained from the ratio of KD to Ka (i.e., KD/Ka) and expressed in molar concentration (M). Kd and Ka refer to the rate of dissociation and association, respectively, of a particular antigen-antibody interaction. The KD values for antibodies can be determined by using methods well established in the art.</p>The term \"monoclonal antibody\" (or \"mAb\") refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., each individual of a monoclonal antibody preparation is identical except for possible mutations (e.g., naturally occurring mutations) that may be present in minor amounts. Nevertheless, there may be some differences in protein sequence between the various antibody molecules present in the composition that are associated with post-translational modifications (e.g., cleavage of heavy chain C-terminal lysines, deamidation of asparagine residues, and/or isomerization of aspartic acid residues). In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations, each monoclonal antibody of a monoclonal antibody preparation is directed against a single determinant on the antigen.</p>The term \"multi-paratope antibody\" as used herein refers to an antibody described herein that comprises two or more different paratopes that interact with different epitopes from the same antigen or from two different antigens. The multi-paratope antibodies described herein may be bi-paratope, tri-paratope, tetra-paratope. </p>The term \"multispecific antibody\" as used herein refers to an antibody described herein that has at least two binding domains, i.e., two or more binding domains, e.g., two or three binding domains, wherein the at least two binding domains independently bind to two different",
    "rmined by using biological membrane layer interferometry (Bio-Layer Interferometry; BLI), which is a label-free technique. It is an optical analysis technique that analyzes interference patterns of white light reflected from two surfaces: a layer of immobilized protein on the biosensor tip, and an internal reference layer. Any change in the number of molecules bound to the biosensor tip causes a shift in the interference pattern, which can be measured in real time (REF). </p>Typically, an array of 30, 60 cloned mutant proteins is used. However, the size of such arrays depends on the size of the target protein and the desired coverage of the solvent accessible area. Preferably, the mutant proteins are provided on 96-well plates or 384-well plates. Typically, BLI instruments can manipulate 96-or 384-well plates for measurements.</p>When using BLI technology, each sensor is typically exposed to a solution containing the molecule of interest (e.g., antibody or ligand) for which the binding site is being measured. The advantage of the BLI technology is that it is nearly as sensitive as normal BIACore, but it is high throughput (96 clones can be tested simultaneously) and uses disposable sensor tips, thus eliminating the need to regenerate and reuse the chip as you would normally do with BIACore.</p>Different measurements of binding of the test antibodies to the mutant TREM1 proteins can be used to determine those in the mutant proteins that exhibit reduced binding. Typically, the dissociation constant or binding constant is measured. Typically, the complete loss of binding or the rate of release of the molecule of interest from the mutant protein can be measured. When measuring the binding properties of antibodies, suitable controls are typically used. Typically, the binding properties are compared to the parent sequence of the target protein (wild-type, WT). Typically, a majority of the mutant proteins will exhibit the same Kd as WT. Mutant proteins exhibiting differences in binding should be considered. Typically, any dissociation constant difference of at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 or more times compared to wild-type TREM1 is considered. Preferably, any difference of at least 3 times is considered significant. Mutant TREM1 proteins that produced results with low noise-signal resolution were ignored or re-measured. </p>If desired, mutant proteins comprising patches of different sizes (e.g., patches with 2 or 3 substitutions) may be used on the array. If more accuracy is required, it is additionally possible to test mutant proteins comprising a single substitution for binding properties, provided that this provides sufficient sensitivity to obtain a measurable effect.</p>Antibodies that bind to TREM1</p>The present invention provides anti-TREM 1 antibodies that bind to human TREM1 (target polypeptide) and have the functional and structural characteristics further described herein.</p>Antibodies in the context of the present invention include whole antibodies and functionally active antibody fragments (i.e., molecules comprising an antigen binding domain that specifically binds an antigen, also referred to as antigen binding fragments). The features described herein also apply to antibody fragments unless the context dictates otherwise. The antibody may be (or be derived from) polyclonal, monoclonal, multivalent, multispecific, bispecific, fully human, humanized or chimeric.</p>Antibodies further described herein are specific antibody types and do not limit the scope of the inventio",
    " display methods, a repertoire of VH and VL genes are cloned separately by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and randomly recombined in a phage library, which can then be screened for antigen-binding phages, as described in Winter et al, ann.rev. Immunol,12:433-455 (1994). Phages typically display antibody fragments as single chain Fv (scFv) fragments or as Fab fragments. Libraries from immunized sources provide high affinity antibodies to immunogens without the need to construct hybridomas. Alternatively, natural libraries (e.g., from humans) can be cloned to provide a single antibody source for a wide range of non-self and also self-antigens without any immunization, as described by Griffiths et al, EMBO J12:725-734 (1993). Finally, natural libraries can also be prepared synthetically by: the unrearranged V-gene segments were cloned from stem cells and PCR primers containing random sequences were used to encode the highly variable CDR3 regions and to accomplish in vitro rearrangement as described by Hoogenboom and Winter, J.mol.biol,227:381-388 (1992). Patent publications describing human antibody phage libraries include, for example: US 5,750,373 and US 2005/007974, US 2005/019455, US2005/0266000, US 2007/017126, US2007/0160598, US2007/0237764, US2007/0292936 and US2009/0002360.</p>Antibodies can be screened by using assays for measuring binding to a target polypeptide and/or assays for measuring the ability of an antibody to block a particular interaction. One example of a binding assay is an ELISA, e.g., using fusion proteins of a target polypeptide immobilized on a plate, and employing conjugated secondary antibodies to detect antibodies that bind to the target. One example of a blocking assay is a flow cytometry-based assay that measures the blocking of ligand proteins that bind to a target polypeptide. The fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies are used to detect the amount of such ligand proteins that bind to the target polypeptide.</p>Antibodies can be isolated by screening a combinatorial library for antibodies having the desired activity. For example, a variety of methods are known in the art for generating phage display libraries and screening such libraries for antibodies having the desired binding characteristics.</p>Antibodies or antibody fragments isolated from a human antibody library are considered human antibodies or human antibody fragments.</p>The antibody may be a full length antibody. More particularly, the antibody may be of the IgG isotype. More particularly, the antibody may be IgG1 or IgG4.</p>The constant region domain of an antibody, if present, may be selected by focusing on the proposed function of the antibody molecule and in particular the effector function that may be required. For example, the constant region domain may be a human IgA, igD, igE, igG or IgM domain. In particular, human IgG constant region domains, particularly of the IgG1 and IgG3 isotype, can be used when the antibody molecule is intended for",
    "re effective inhibition of binding of other ligands than PGLYRP1 at different sites on TREM 1.</p>As demonstrated by the examples, PGLYRP1 binds to an epitope on TREM1 comprising residues selected from the list consisting of: e27, D42-E46, A49, Y90-L95 and F126 of human TREM1 (SEQ ID NO: 1), e.g. in a range of less thanMeasured at the contact distance.</p>In a particular embodiment, the invention provides antibodies that bind to a region on TREM1 that is different from the binding site of PGLYRP1, such that the binding still prevents interaction between TREM1 and PGLYRP 1. </p>In one embodiment, the anti-TREM 1 antibody exhibits very weak binding to cynomolgus TREM1. In some embodiments, the anti-TREM 1 antibody does not exhibit detectable binding to mouse, rat, pig or dog TREM1.</p>In some embodiments, the anti-TREM 1 antibody reduces release of a variety of cytokines and chemokines (e.g., CCL-3, CCL-20, CXCL-9, GM-CSF, IFN-gamma, IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-15, IL-18, IL-27, TNF- \u03b1, and TNF- \u03b2) from activated human monocytes.</p>In some embodiments, the anti-TREM 1 is IgG4P and significantly increases the release of an IL-1R antagonist (IL-1 RA) (an anti-inflammatory down regulator of the IL-1 pathway) from primary human monocytes.</p>The antibody according to the invention is specific for human TREM1.</p>In some embodiments, the antibody binds to human TREM1 with sufficient affinity and specificity. In certain embodiments, the antibody binds human TREM1 with a KD of any of about 1 \u03bcm, 100nM, 50nM, 40nM, 30nM, 20nM, 10nM, 5nM, 1nM, 0.5nM (including any range between these values). In one embodiment, an antibody according to the invention binds human TREM1 with a KD of less than 600 pM. In a more particular embodiment, the antibody according to the invention binds human TREM1 with a KD of 300-1200pM, more preferably 300-600 pM. </p>The affinity of the antibody, and the extent to which the antibody inhibits binding, can be determined by the skilled artisan using conventional techniques such as those described by Scatchard et al (Ann. KY. Acad. Sci.51:660-672 (1949)), or by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) using a system such as BIAcore. For surface plasmon resonance, the target molecules are immobilized on a solid phase and exposed to ligands in a mobile phase running along a flow cell. If ligand binding to the immobilized target occurs, the local refractive index changes, resulting in a change in the SPR angle, which can be monitored in real time by detecting a change in the intensity of the reflected light. The rate of change of the SPR signal may be analyzed to generate an apparent rate constant for the association and dissociation phases of the binding reaction. The ratio of these values gives the apparent equilibrium constant (affinity) (see, e.g., wolff et al, cancer Res.53:2560-65 (1993)).</p>Preferably, the antibody according to the invention is specific for human TREM 1.</p>The disclosure herein with respect to antibodies, particularly with respect to binding affinity and specificity, and activity, also applies to antigen binding fragments and antibody-like molecules.</p>Antibodies binding to the same epitope </p>Antibodies may bind to TREM1 or bind to the same epitopes as those defined above in terms of light chain, heavy chain, light Chain Varia",
    "he test antibody and the reference antibody compete for binding to the antigen. As the skilled artisan will appreciate, antibodies that compete for binding with the reference antibody may not necessarily bind to the same epitope as the reference antibody, but may spatially block binding of the reference antibody by binding to overlapping or adjacent epitopes, or cause conformational changes, resulting in lack of binding.</p>If each antibody competitively inhibits (blocks) the binding of the other antibody to the antigen, then both antibodies bind to the same or overlapping epitope. Alternatively, two antibodies have the same epitope if substantially all amino acid mutations in the antigen that reduce or eliminate binding of one antibody reduce or eliminate binding of the other antibody. If some amino acid mutations that reduce or eliminate the binding of one antibody reduce or eliminate the binding of another antibody, then the two antibodies have overlapping epitopes. </p>Additional routine experimentation (e.g., peptide mutation and binding analysis) can then be performed to confirm whether the observed lack of binding of the subject antibody is in fact due to binding to the same antigenic moiety as the reference antibody, or whether steric blocking (or another phenomenon) is responsible for the observed lack of binding. Experiments of this kind may be performed by using ELISA, RIA, surface plasmon resonance, flow cytometry or any other quantitative or qualitative antibody binding assay available in the art.</p>Antibody variants</p>In certain embodiments, antibody variants having one or more amino acid substitutions, insertions, and/or deletions are provided. The sites of interest for substitution mutagenesis include CDRs and FR. Amino acid substitutions may be introduced into the antibody of interest and the product screened for desired activity (e.g., retention/improved antigen binding, reduced immunogenicity, or improved ADCC or CDC).</p>In certain embodiments, amino acid sequence variants of the antibodies described herein are contemplated. For example, it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and/or other biological properties of the antibodies. Amino acid sequence variants of the anti-TREM 1 antibodies may be prepared by introducing appropriate modifications into the nucleotide sequence encoding the protein or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include, for example, deletions and/or insertions and/or substitutions of residues within the amino acid sequence (e.g., in one or more CDRs and/or framework sequences, or in VH and/or VL domains) of the anti-TREM 1 antibody. Any combination of deletions, insertions, and substitutions may be made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct has the desired characteristics. </p>In certain embodiments of the variant VH and VL sequences provided herein, each HVR is either unchanged or comprises no more than one, two, or three amino acid substitutions.</p>It will",

The hIgG1 LALA molecules for both 12172g L2g H11 and 12172g L6g H6 were found to exhibit less self-interactions than the corresponding hIgG4P molecules, as shown by the lower \u0394\u03bbmax (nm). In addition, 12172g L6g H6 (hIgG 4P and hIgG1 LALA) molecules showed slightly lower \u0394\u03bbmax (nm) values than 12172g L2g H11 (hIgG 4P and hIgG1 LALA) molecules. Table 22.

The data are shown in table 23.</p>The kD interaction parameters for both the hig 4P and hig 1 LALA molecules in common pre-formulated storage buffer pH 5 were shown to be less negative (more colloidally stable) than the data obtained in common pre-formulated storage buffer pH 7.4. The hIgG1 LALA molecules were shown to be more stable than the corresponding hIgG4P molecules. In addition, 12172 g L6g H6 (hIgG 4P and hIgG1 LALA) molecules exhibited slightly greater colloidal stability than 12172 g L2g H11 (hIgG 4P and hIgG1 LALA). This data corroborates the data generated from the AC-SINS assay (see example 17). </p>Table 23. KD interaction parameter data for 12172 g L2g H11 and 12172 g L6g H6 (hIgG 4P and hIgG1 LALA).
