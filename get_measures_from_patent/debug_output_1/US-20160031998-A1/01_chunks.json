    "erein, the term \u201cdoes not significantly bind\u201d shall be understood to mean that the level of binding of a protein of the disclosure to a polypeptide is not statistically significantly higher than background, e.g., the level of binding signal detected in the absence of the protein and/or in the presence of a negative control protein (e.g., an isotype control antibody) and/or the level of binding detected in the presence of a negative control polypeptide. The level of binding is detected using biosensor analysis (e.g. Biacore) in which the protein is immobilized and contacted with an antigen.</p>As used herein, phrases referring to \u201creduced binding\u201d or \u201cbinding being at a lower level\u201d in relation to an antigen will be understood to mean that an antibody binds to an antigen (e.g., an alanine point mutant of SEQ ID NO:1 at any one of positions 287, 237, 198, 172, 171 or 111) with an affinity at least about 20 fold or 40 fold or 60 fold less than a control epitope or antigen (e.g. SEQ ID NO:1). For example, a protein of the present disclosure can bind to a polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 1 in which an alanine is substituted for the histidine at position 237 at a level 20 fold or 40 fold or 60 fold less than it binds to a polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 1. Preferably, the protein binds at a level 20 fold less, more preferably 40 fold less, still more preferably 60 fold less.</p>A protein or antibody may be considered to \u201cpreferentially bind\u201d to a polypeptide if it binds that polypeptide with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) that is less than the protein's or antibody's K<sub>D </sub>for another polypeptide. In one example, a protein or antibody is considered to preferentially bind to a polypeptide if it binds the polypeptide with an affinity (i.e., K<sub>D</sub>) that is at least about 20 fold or 40 fold or 60 fold or 80 fold or 100 fold or 120 fold or 140 fold or 160 fold more than the protein's or antibody's K<sub>D </sub>for another polypeptide.</p>As used herein, the term \u201csimilar affinity\u201d will be understood to mean that a protein of the present disclosure binds to two antigens (e.g., the ligand binding domain of G-CSFR from humans and from cynomolgus monkeys) with affinities that are within about 5 fold or less of one another, e.g., within about 4, 3, 2, or 1 fold of one another, such as, within about 0.5 fold of one another or the levels of binding are substantially identical, e.g., when the affinity is assessed by immobilizing the two antigens (e.g., the ligand binding domain of G-CSFR or extracellular domains from humans and from cynomolgus monkeys) and contacting the immobilized proteins with a protein of the disclosure.</p>For the purposes of clarification and as will be apparent to the skilled artisan based on the exemplified subject matter herein, reference to \u201caffinity\u201d in this specification is a reference to K<sub>D </sub>of a protein or antibody.</p>For the purposes of clarification and as will be apparent to the skilled artisan based on the ",
    "es comprising 10-15 amino acids are produced. The protein is then contacted to each peptide and the peptide(s) to which it binds determined. This permits determination of peptide(s) comprising the epitope to which the protein binds. If multiple non-contiguous peptides are bound by the protein, the protein may bind a conformational epitope.</p>Alternatively, or in addition, amino acid residues within hG-CSFR are mutated, e.g., by alanine scanning mutagenesis, and mutations that reduce or prevent protein binding are determined. Any mutation that reduces or prevents binding of the protein is likely to be within the epitope bound by the protein.</p>A further method is exemplified herein, and involves binding hG-CSFR or a region thereof to an immobilized protein of the present disclosure and digesting the resulting complex with proteases. Peptide that remains bound to the immobilized protein are then isolated and analyzed, e.g., using mass spectrometry, to determine their sequence.</p>A further method involves converting hydrogens in hG-CSFR or a region thereof to deutrons and binding the resulting protein to an immobilized protein of the present disclosure. The deutrons are then converted back to hydrogen, the hG-CSFR or region thereof isolated, digested with enzymes and analyzed, e.g., using mass spectrometry to identify those regions comprising deutrons, which would have been protected from conversion to hydrogen by the binding of a protein described herein.</p>Optionally, the dissociation constant (Kd) of a protein for hG-CSFR or an epitope thereof is determined. The \u201cKd\u201d or \u201cKd value\u201d for a hG-CSFR binding protein is in one example measured by a radiolabeled or fluorescently-labeled hG-CSFR binding assay. This assay equilibrates the protein with a minimal concentration of labeled G-CSFR in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled hG-CSFR. Following washing to remove unbound hG-CSFR, the amount of label is determined, which is indicative of the Kd of the protein.</p>According to another example the Kd or Kd value is measured by using surface plasmon resonance assays, e.g., using BIAcore surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) with immobilized hG-CSFR or a region thereof.</p>In some examples, proteins having a similar Kd or a higher Kd than C1.2 or C1.2G are selected, because they are likely to compete for binding to hG-CSFR.</p>Determining Competitive BindingAssays for determining a protein that competitively inhibits binding of monoclonal antibody C1.2 or C1.2G will be apparent to the skilled artisan. For example, C1.2 or C1.2G is conjugated to a detectable label, e.g., a fluorescent label or a radioactive label. The labeled antibody and the test protein are then mixed and contacted with hG-CSFR or a region thereof (e.g., a polypeptide comprising SEQ ID NO: 1) or a cell expressing same. The level of labeled C1.2 or C1.2G is then determined and compared to the level determined when the labeled antibody is contacted with the hG-CSFR, region or cells in the absence of the protein. If the level of labeled C1.2 or C1.2G is reduced in the presence of the test protein compared to the absence of the protein, the protein is considered to competitively inhibit binding of C1.2 or C1.2G to hG-CSFR.</p>Optionally, the test protein is conjugated to different label to C1.2 or C1.2G. This alternate labeling permits detection of the level of binding of the test protein to hG-CSFR or the region thereof or the cell.</p>In another example, the protein is permitted to bind to hG-CSFR or a region thereof (e.g., a polypeptide comprising SEQ ID NO: 1) or a cell expressing same prior to contacting the hG-CSFR, region or cell with C1.2 or C1.2G. A reduction in the amount of bound C1.2 or C1.2G in the presence of the protein compared to in the absence of the protein indicates that the protein competitively inhibits C1.2 or C1.2G binding to hG-CSFR. A reciprocal assay can also be performed using labeled protein and first allowing C1.2 or C1.2G to bind to G-CSFR. In this case, a reduced amount of labeled protein bound to hG-CSFR in the presence of C1.2 or C1.2G compared to in the absence of C1.2 or C1.2G indicates that the protein competitively inhibits binding of C1.2 or C1.2G to hG-CSFR.</p>Any of the foregoing assays can be performed with a mutant form of hG-CSFR and/or SEQ ID NO: 1 and/or a ligand binding region of hG-CSFR to which C1.2 or C1.2G binds, e.g., as described herein.</p>Determining NeutralizationIn some examples of the present disclosure, a protein is capable of neutralizing hG-CSFR signaling.</p>Various assays are known in the art for assessing the ability of a protein to neutralize signaling of a ligand through a receptor.</p>In one example, the protein reduces or prevents G-CSF binding to the hG-CSFR. These assays can be performed as a competitive binding assay as described herein using labeled G-CSF and/or labeled protein.</p>In another example, the protein reduces formation of CFU-G when CD34<sup>+</sup> bone marrow cells are cultured in the presence of G-CSF. In such assays, CD34<sup>+</sup> bone marrow cells are cultured in a semi-solid cell culture medium in the presence of G-CSF (e.g., about 10 ng/ml cell culture medium) and, optionally stem cell factor (e.g., about 10 ng/ml cell culture medium) in the presence or absence of a test protein. After a sufficient time for granulocyte clones (CFU-G) to form, the number of clones or colonies is determined. A reduction in the number of colonies in the presence of the protein compared to in the absence of the protein indicates that the protein neutralizes G-CSF signaling. By testing multiple concentrations of the protein an IC<sub>50 </sub>is determined, i.e., a concentration at which 50% of the maximum inhibition of CFU-G formation occurs. In one example, the IC<sub>50 </sub>is 0.2 nM or less, such as 0.1 nM or less, for example, 0.09 nM or less, or 0.08 nM or less, or 0.07 nM or less, or 0.06 nM or less or 0.05 nM or less. In one example, the IC<sub>50 </sub>is 0.04 nM or less. In another example, the IC<sub>50 </sub>is 0.02 nM or less. The foregoing IC<sub>50</sub>s relate to any CFU-G assay described herein.</p>In a further example, the protein reduces proliferation of cells (e.g., BaF3 cells) expressing hG-CSFR which are cultured in the presence of G-CSF.

    "tants for antibodies C1.2, 744 and 774 was measured, and compared to that of SEQ ID NO:1. If a mutation resulted in a change of affinity by more than a factor of 2 from that of SEQ ID NO:1, that residue was deemed to contribute to the binding interaction, and thus is likely to be in or near the epitope.
