Chloroquine may interfere with the endocytic pathway to widely inhibit SARS-CoV-2 (Wang et al, cell Res (2020)), SARS-CoV (Vincent et al, virol J2,69 (2005)), influenza virus, ebola virus, and other in vitro viruses (Rebeaud &amp; Zores, front Med (Lausanne) 7,184 (2020)).   However, their clinical efficacy in COVID-19 patients is limited due to their potential cardiac side effects and lack of in vivo antiviral activity (Maisonnasse et al, nature (2020), falzarano et al, EMERG INFECT DIS, 1065-1067 (2015)), borba et al, JAMA Netw Open 3, e208857 (2020), erickson et al, toxicol Commun 4,40-42 (2020), hashem et al, TRAVEL MED INFECT DIS 35,101735 (2020).   Phase III trials for influenza are underway in the united states for the clinically available drug arbidol in china and russia.   Abidol demonstrates broad-spectrum in vitro antiviral activity against many viruses including influenza virus, coronavirus and Ebola virus (Hulseberg et al, journal of virology93 (2019), kadam, &amp; Wilson, proc NATL ACAD SCI U S A114, 206-214 (2017)), with an IC50 of 2-20 \u03bcg ml-1 for SARS-CoV-2 (Wang et al, cell Res (2020), wang et al, cell discover 6,28 (2020)).   However, the peak serum concentration of arbidol was below 2 \u03bcg ml-1 (Deng et al, antimicrob Agents chemther 57,1743-1755 (2013), sun et al, int J Clin Pharmacol Ther, 423-432 (2013)) within 5 hours after administration of conventional drug doses, which may explain the uncertain clinical efficacy of arbidol in SARS-CoV-2 patients (Zhu et al, J effect 81, e21-e23 (2020), lian et al, clin Microbiol Infect, 917-921 (2020), li et al, med (N Y) (2020)).   Inhibitors of TMPRSS2, which promote viral entry into the Cell surface, have been demonstrated to inhibit SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses (Hoffmann et al, cell 181,271-280e278 (2020), zhou et al, ANTIVIRAL RES, 76-84 (2015)).</p>An effective broad-spectrum antiviral drug would improve patient prognosis and could even reduce community and hospital transmission prior to identification of emerging viruses and specific antiviral drugs. The \"one-disease one-drug\" approach to antiviral drugs against HIV, hepatitis c virus and influenza virus has been successful (Vigant et al, nat Rev Microbiol, 426-437 (2015)). However, a broad spectrum antiviral drug is urgently needed to combat new emerging and reoccurring new viral outbreaks, such as SARS-CoV-2, before new viruses are identified or specific antiviral drugs are available.</p>It is an object of the present invention to provide broad spectrum antiviral agents.</p>It is ano",
    "hanisms of basic peptides.</p>Additionally or alternatively, the composition may comprise two or more active agents selected from one or more small molecule drugs, optionally in combination with P9R or derivatives thereof as mono-or multivalent peptides, which together may inhibit two access pathways for viruses such as SAR-CoV-2.</p>A. Antiviral agents</p>Antiviral peptides and small molecule active agents, and combinations thereof, are provided.</p>1. Antiviral peptides</p>The disclosed antiviral peptides preferably consist of a P9R sequence. However, the antiviral peptide may include peptides derived from P9R as long as the amino acids at positions 21, 23 and 28 are positively charged amino acids. Thus, the peptide may have the same amino acid sequence as P9R, wherein the arginine at positions 21, 23 and 28 is replaced with a positively charged amino acid such as lysine or histidine. However, it is essential that any modification of the P9R structure ensures that the resulting peptide retains inhibition of endosomal acidification and retains the same degree of viral binding as P9R. Thus, useful P9R-derived peptides (referred to herein as P9R-like peptides) have the properties of \"inhibiting endosomal acidification\" and \"viral binding\". As shown in the examples of the present application, one of ordinary skill in the art would be able to alter the amino acids in P9R and test for the desired activity (inhibition of endosomal acidification and \"viral binding\").</p>The \"virus binding assay\" comprises the steps of: peptides (0.1 \u03bcg per well) were dissolved in H <sub>2</sub> O and coated onto ELISA plates, followed by incubation overnight at 4 \u2103. Then, 2% BSA was added to the blocking plate overnight at 4 \u2103. For binding of the virus to the peptide, the virus was diluted in phosphate buffer and then added to ELISA plates and bound to the coated peptide for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing the unbound virus, the bound virus was lysed by RLT buffer of RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, cat# 74106) for viral RNA extraction. Viral RNA copies bound to the virus were measured by RT-qPCR.</p>The \"endosomal acidification assay\" may include detection of endosomal acidification using a pH sensitive dye (pHrodo red dextrose, invitrogen, cat#P10361) according to manufacturer's instructions as previously described but with minor modifications (Zhao et al, nat Commun 9,2358 (2018)). First, MDCK cells were treated with BSA (25.0. Mu.g ml <sup>-1</sup>)\u3001P9(25.0\u03bcg ml<sup>-1</sup>)\u3001P9R(25.0\u03bcg ml<sup>-1</sup>)\u3001PA1(25.0\u03bcg ml<sup>-1</sup>) or P9RS (25.0. Mu.g ml <sup>-1</sup>) at 4\u2103for 15 minutes. Next, 100. Mu.g ml- <sup>1</sup> of pH sensitive dye and DAPI were added to MDCK cells and incubated at 4\u2103for 15 minutes. Cells were further incubated at 37 \u2103 for 15 minutes before taking images, and then cells were washed twice with PBS. Finally, PBS was added to the cells and images were immediately taken using a confocal microscope (e.g., carl Zeiss LSM 700, germany).</p>Thus"
