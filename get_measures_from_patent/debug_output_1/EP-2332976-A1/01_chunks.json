    "1-Fc and B7RP1-Fc Fusion ProteinsTo construct the DNA expression vector for the CRP1- Fc fusion protein, the coding sequence for the first amino terminal 147 amino acids of the CRP1 was fused, inframe, to the coding sequence for the carboxy terminal 235 amino acids of the human Fc gene (isotype IgG1) and ligated within the polylinker sequence of pcDNA3 (pcDNA3/CRP1-Fc). To construct the DNA expression vector for the B7RP1- Fc fusion protein, the coding sequence for the first amino terminal 269 amino acids of the B7RP1 was fused, inframe, to the coding sequence for the carboxy terminal 235 amino acids of the human Fc gene (isotype IgG1) and ligated within the polylinker sequence of pcDNA3 (pcDNA3/B7RP1-Fc). The coding sequences of both CRP1 and B7RP1 contained sequences from the N-terminus of each protein up to, but not including, the putative transmembrane region of each protein. 293T cells were transfected with either pcDNA3/CRP1-Fc or pcDNA3/B7RP1-Fc using the FuGene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). After four days, the conditioned media were collected and the Fc fusion proteins were purified by batch chromatography using Protein A Sepharose (Pharmacia). Fc fusion proteins bound to the column were eluted with three column volumes of Immunopure Gentle Elution Buffer (Pierce), and then were dialyzed against 150 volumes of 20 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.5. The dialyzed protein was concentrated using Macrosep centrifugal concentrates, 30 kD MWCO (Pall Filtron), and the protein concentrations were calculated using extinction coefficients derived from the amino acid sequence of each protein. Expression of CRP1-Fc fusion protein is shown in Figure 4A, expression of B7CPR1-Fc fusion protein is shown in Figure 4B.</p>Example 8Identification of CRP1 and B7RP1 as a Receptor-ligand PairIn order to determine whether the novel proteins were part of the same costimulatory pathway as that containing CD28, CTLA-4, B7.1, and B7.2, we utilized a cell surface display assay. This assay uses ACAS (Adherent Cell Analysis and Sorting) analysis to analyze whether membrane-bound proteins expressed in cells interact with various Fc fusion proteins. Cells expressing membrane-bound proteins, indicated on the left side of Figure 5, were incubated with Fc fusions proteins, indicated at the top of the figure.</p>Cos-7 cells, grown in DMEM media with 10% FBS, were plated at 500,000 cells/well in a 24-well plate. Cells were transfected using the FuGene 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). For each transfection, 3 \u00b5l of FuGene 6 reagent was added to 47 \u00b5l of serum free DMEM media. After a 10 min incubation at room temperature, the mix was added to 0.25 \u00b5g of plasmid dropwise and then was incubated for 15 minutes. The above mix was then added to the cells with 0.5 ml of DMEM with 10% FBS. The cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a 5% C02 atmosphere.</p>As a control, CHO D- cells, stably transfected with an expression plasm"
