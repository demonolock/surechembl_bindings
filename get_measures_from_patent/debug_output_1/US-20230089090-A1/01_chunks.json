    "the direct fusion of viral and cellular membrane furin is a key factor for viral entry of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) through cleaving its envelope glycoprotein. In addition, furin could proteolytically activate membrane fusion activity of influenza viruses through cutting their hemagglutinin [this] expression of endopeptidases may provide a 100-fold higher efficient infection pathway than receptor-mediated endocytosis does. Whether the treatment of furin inhibitors could benefit these SARS-CoV-2-infected patients deserves further researches. See journals.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/physrev.00013.2020.</p>Observations suggest that inhibitors of furin-like enzymes may contribute to inhibiting virus propagation.

Analysis of virus particles from luteolin-treated cells revealed that prM was not cleaved efficiently. Biochemical interrogation of human furin showed that luteolin inhibited the enzyme activity in an uncompetitive manner, with Ki value of 58.6 \u03bcM, suggesting that treatment may restrict the virion maturation process. The envelope glycoprotein of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) initiates infection by mediating fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane. Fusion activity requires proteolytic cleavage of the gp160 protein into gp120 and gp41 at a site containing several arginine and lysine residues. The glycoprotein of HIV-1, which has the same protease recognition motif as the FPV haemagglutinin, is also activated by furin. See www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28389141.</p>Luteolin treatment of HIV-1 infected lymphocytes also showed inhibition in cell aggregation/syncytia similar to that produced by DRB and cell control, suggesting that viral envelope (gp120) protein expression on cell surfaces is impaired. . . . the glycoprotein of HIV-1 . . . is also activated by furin.
