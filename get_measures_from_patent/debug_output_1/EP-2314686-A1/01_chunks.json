    "dy-producing cell derived from CHO-DG44 cell and purification of antibodyThe anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody-producing transformant cell line 5-03 obtained in the item 1(2) of Example 8 was cultured at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator using IMDM-dFBS(10) medium in a 182 cm<sup>2</sup> flask (manufactured by Greiner). When the cell density reached confluent after several days, the culture supernatant was discarded, and the cells were washed with 25 ml of PBS buffer and then mixed with 35 ml of EXCELL 301 medium (manufactured by JRH). After culturing them at 37\u00b0C for 7 days in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator, the culture supernatant was recovered. The anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody was purified from the culture supernatant using Prosep-A (manufactured by Millipore) column in accordance with the manufacture's instructions. The purified anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody was named KM3060.</p>When the binding activity to CCR4 of KM2760-1 and KM3060 was measured by ELISA, they showed equivalent binding activity.</p>4. Analysis of purified anti-CCR4 chimeric antibodiesEach (4 \u00b5g) of the two kinds of the anti-CCR4 chimeric antibodies produced by and purified from in different animal cells, obtained in the item 1 of this Example was subjected to SDS-PAGE in accordance with a known method [Nature, 227, 680 (1970)], and the molecular weight and purification degree were analyzed. In each of the purified anti-CCR4 chimeric antibodies, a single band corresponding to the molecular weight of about 150 Kd was found under non-reducing conditions, and two bands of about 50 Kd and about 25 Kd were found under reducing conditions. The molecular weights almost coincided with the molecular weights deduced from the cDNA nucleotide sequences of antibody H chain and L chain (H chain: about 49 Kd, L chain: about 23 Kd, whole molecule: about 144 Kd) and coincided with reports stating that an IgG type antibody has a molecular weight of about 150 Kd under non-reducing conditions and is degraded into H chain having a molecular weight of about 50 Kd and L chain having a molecular weight of about 25 Kd under reducing conditions caused by cutting an S-S bond in the molecule [Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Chapter 14 (1988), Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, Academic Press Limited (1996)], thus confirming that the anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody was expressed and purified as an antibody molecule having a correct structure.</p>5. Preparation of anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody having different ratio of \u03b1-1,6-fucose-free sugar chainSugar chains which are bound to anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody KM2760-1 derived from YB2/0 cell prepared in the item 3(1) of Example 8 and the anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody KM3060 derived from CHO/DG44 cell prepared in the item 3(2) of Example 8 were analyzed in accordance with the method of Example 10(6). The ratio of \u03b1-1,6-fucose-free sugar chains was 87% and 8% in KM2760 and KM3060, respectively. Herein, the samples are referred to as anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody (87%) and anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody (8%).</p>The anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody (87%) and anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody (8%) were mixed at a ratio of anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody (87%) : anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody (8%) = 1 : 39, 16 : 67, 22 : 57, 32 : 47 or 42 : 37. Sugar chains of these samples were analyzed in accordance with the method of Example 10(6). The ratio of \u03b1-1,6-fucose-free sugar chains was 9%, 18%, 27%, 39% and 46%, respectively. Herein, these samples are referred to as anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody (9%), anti-CCR4 chimeric antibody (18%), anti-"
