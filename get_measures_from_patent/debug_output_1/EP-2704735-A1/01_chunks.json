    "nce, an extracellular domain sequence), naturally-occurring variant forms {e.g., alternatively spliced forms) and naturally-occurring allelic variants. Receptor variants may include fragments or deletion mutants of the native sequence Apo-2L receptor. A transcriptional splice variant of human DR5 is known in the art. This DR5 splice variant encodes the 440 amino acid sequence of human DR5. </p> \"Death receptor antibody\" is used herein to refer generally to antibody or antibodies directed to a receptor in the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily and containing a death domain capable of signalling apoptosis, and such antibodies include DR5 antibody and DR4 antibody. </p> \"DR5 receptor antibody\", \"DR5 antibody\", or \"anti-DR5 antibody\" is used in a broad sense to refer to antibodies that bind to at least one form of a DR5 receptor, such as the 1-411 sequence or the 1-440 sequence, or extracellular domain thereof. Optionally the DR5 antibody is fused or linked to a heterologous sequence or molecule. Preferably the heterologous sequence allows or assists the antibody to form higher order or oligomeric complexes. Optionally, the DR5 antibody binds to DR5 receptor but does not bind or cross-react with any additional Apo-2L receptor (e.g. DR4, DcRl, or DcR2) . Optionally the antibody is an agonist of DR5 signalling activity. </p> Optionally, the DR5 antibody of the invention binds to a DR5 receptor at a concentration range of about 0.1 nM to about 20 mM as measured in a BIAcore binding assay. Optionally, the DR5 antibodies of the invention exhibit an Ic 50 value of about 0.6 nM to about 18 mM as measured in a BIAcore binding assay. </p> \"DR4 receptor antibody\", \"DR4 antibody\", or \"anti-DR4 antibody\" is used in a broad sense to refer to antibodies that bind to at least one form of a DR4 receptor or extracellular domain thereof. Optionally the DR4 antibody is fused or linked to a heterologous sequence or molecule. Preferably the heterologous sequence allows or assists the antibody to form higher order or oligomeric complexes. Optionally, the DR4 antibody binds to DR4 receptor but does not bind or cross-react with any additional Apo-2L receptor (e.g. DR5, DcRl, or DcR2) . Optionally the antibody is an agonist of DR4 signalling activity. </p> Optionally, the DR4 antibody of the invention binds to a DR4 receptor at a concentration range of about 0.1 nM to about 20 mM as measured in a \n\nBIAcore binding assay. Optionally, the DR4 antibodies of the invention exhibit an Ic 50 value of about 0.6 nM to about 18 mM as measured in a BIAcore binding assay. </p> The term \"agonist\" is used in the broadest sense, and includes any molecule that partially or fully enhances, stimulates or activates one or more biological activities of Apo2L/TRAIL, DR4 or DR5, in vitro, in situ, or in vivo. Examples of such biological activities are binding of Apo2L/TRAIL to DR4 or DR5, including apoptosis as well as those further reported in the literature. An agonist may function in a direct or indirect manner. For instance, the agonist may function to partially or fully enhance, stimulate or activate one or more biological activities of DR4 or DR5, in vitro, in situ, or in vivo as a result of its direct binding to DR4 or DR5, which causes receptor activation or signal transduction. The agonist may also function indirectly to partially or fully enhance, stimulate or activate one or more biological activities of DR4 or DR5, in vitro, in situ, or in vivo as a result of, e.g., stimulating another effector molecule which then causes DR4 or DR5 activation or signal transduction. It is contemplated that an agonist may act as an enhancer molecule which functions indirectly to enhance or increase DR4 or DR5 activation or activity. For instance, the agonist may enhance activity of endogenous Apo-2L in a mammal. This could be accomplished, for example, by pre-complexing DR4 or DR5 or by stabilizing complexes of the respective ligand with the DR4 or DR5 receptor (such as stabilizing native complex formed between Apo-2L and DR4 or DR5) . </p> The"
