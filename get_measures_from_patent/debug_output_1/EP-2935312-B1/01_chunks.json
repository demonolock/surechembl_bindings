    " next day. Hanks balanced salt solution, without phenol red, containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.3) and 2.5 mM probenecid (assay buffer) was prepared fresh for each experiment. Compound dilutions were made using a Beckman Biomek 2000 laboratory automation workstation, in assay buffer containing 1 % DMSO. The dye-loading buffer consisted of a final concentration of 2 \u00b5M Fluo-4-AM (dissolved in DMSO and pluronic acid) in assay buffer. The existing culture media was removed from the wells and 100 \u00b5l of the dye-loading buffer was added to each well and incubated for approximately 60 min at 37 \u00b0C in a 5 % CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 95 % humidity. Once dye-loaded, the cells were washed thoroughly on an Embla cell washer with the assay buffer to remove any unincorporated dye. Exactly 100 \u00b5l assay buffer was left in each well.</p>Each 96 well plate containing dye-loaded cells was placed into the FLIPR machine and the laser intensity set to a suitable level to detect low basal fluorescence. To test compounds as agonists, 25 \u00b5l diluted compound was added to the plate 10 seconds into the fluorescent measurements and fluorescent response was recorded for 5 minutes. The fluorescence data was normalized to the endogenous full agonist dose-response set at 100 % for the maximum response and 0 % for the minimum. Each agonist concentration-response curve was constructed using a four parameter logistic equation with Microsoft Excel XLFit as follows: Y = Minimum + ((Maximum - Minimum) / (1 + 10 <sup>(LogEC50-X)nH</sup>)), where y is the % normalized fluorescence, minimum is the minimum y, maximum is the maximum y, logEC<sub>50</sub> is the log<sub>10</sub> concentration which produces 50 % of the maximum induced fluorescence, x is the log<sub>10</sub> of the concentration of the agonist compound and H is the slope of the curve (the Hill Coefficient). The maximum value gives the efficacy of the agonist test compound in percentage. The concentration of agonist that produced a half-maximal response is represented by the EC<sub>50</sub> value, the logarithm of which yielded the pEC<sub>50</sub> value.</p>The following EC<sub>50</sub> (nM), and efficacy (%) for the specific peptides may be provided, together with comparative data for hV1a and hV2:\nExpl.hOT EC<sub>50</sub>(nM) / efficacy (%)hV1a EC<sub>50</sub> (nM)hV2 EC<sub>50</sub> (nM)/ efficacy (%)Expl.hOT EC<sub>50</sub>(nM)/ efficacy (%)hV1a EC<sub>50</sub> (nM)/ efficacy (%)hV2 EC<sub>50</sub> (nM) efficacy (%)110/111&gt;270004800/1072932/130&gt;1000010682/3929/112&gt;270007906/74306/119&gt;10000142/10434/94319/131&gt;100002708/91431/102324/119&gt;100001985/1065181/108332/119&gt;270003821/101611/95&gt;270003410/136&gt;10000145/1207124/87353/111&gt;100001672/1048100/923641/1389118/93374/1371017/91&gt;2700381/1261111/94&gt;27000390.4/122&gt;270003707/1111248/82400.4/124&gt;270002194/117130.2/111&gt;270005110/974169/11714250/92421/1191552/102&gt;120004326/1241630/105&gt;12000440.5/117&gt;270001230/1121745/92&gt;12000450.6/"
