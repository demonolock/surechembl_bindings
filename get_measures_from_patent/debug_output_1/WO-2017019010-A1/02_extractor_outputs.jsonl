Specific examples of suitable polyprotic acids that have a low first dissociation constant include, for instance, organic acids, such as carboxylic acids (e.g., maleic acid (pk<sub>a</sub>i of 1.9) and/or sulfosuccinic acid (pk<sub>a</sub>i of -1.65)); inorganic acids, such as phosphoric acid (pk<sub>a</sub>i of 2.18); or combinations of the foregoing. \nMaleic acid has a pk<sub>a</sub>i of 1.9. \nSulfosuccinic acid has a pk<sub>a</sub>i of -1.65. \nPhosphoric acid has a pk<sub>a</sub>i of 2.18."}
