    "> Background of the Invention </p> Pathogenic viruses are generally classified into two general types: enveloped and non- enveloped viruses. Some well-known enveloped viruses include herpes virus, influenza virus; </p>paramyxovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, HIV, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and togavirus. Non-enveloped viruses, sometimes referred to as \"naked\" viruses, include the families Picornaviridae, Reoviridae, Caliciviridae, Papovaviridae, Adenoviridae and Parvoviridae. Members of these families include rhinovirus, poliovirus, adenovirus, hepatitis A virus, norovirus, coxsackievirus, enterovirus, papillomavirus, and rotavirus. \"Enveloped\" viruses are relatively sensitive and, thus, can be inactivated by commonly used disinfectants. In contrast, \"non-enveloped\" viruses are substantially more resistant to conventional disinfectants and are more environmentally stable than enveloped viruses. Thus, most disinfectants have insufficient efficacy against these types of non-enveloped viruses. As such, a need currently exists for a disinfectant composition that is capable of exhibiting improved antiviral efficacy, particularly against non-enveloped viruses. </p> Summary of the Invention </p> In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a disinfectant composition is disclosed that comprises from about 0.1 wt.% to about 10 wt.% of a primary antiviral agent, wherein the primary antiviral agent includes a polyprotic acid having a first acid dissociation constant of about 3.0 or less; from about 0.1 wt.% to about 15 wt.% of a secondary antiviral agent, wherein the secondary antiviral agent is selected from the group consisting of anionic N-acyl compounds, metal halide salts, amine compounds, aliphatic amine oxides, alkyl glycosides, alcohol ethoxylates, and combinations thereof; and from about 70 wt.% to about 99.5 wt.% of a solvent system that includes one or more solvents, wherein water constitutes at least about 50 wt.% of the solvent system. The composition has a pH of about 4.5 or less and exhibits a reduction in virus infectivity of about 30% or more after being exposed to a non-enveloped virus for 10 minutes. </p> Other features and aspects of the present invention are discussed in greater detail below. </p> Detailed Description of Representative Embodiments </p> Reference now will be made in detail to various embodiments of the invention, one or more examples of which are set forth below. Each example is provided by way of explanation of the invention, not limitation of the invention. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations may be made in the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment, may be used on another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers such modifications and variations as come within the scope \n\n of the appended claims and their equivalents. </p> Generally speaking, the present invention is directed to a disinfectant composition that contains a unique combination of a primary antiviral agent and a secondary antiviral agent. More particularly, the primary antiviral agent includes a polyprotic acid having a low first acid dissociation constant (pK<sub>a</sub>i), such as about 3.0 or less, in some embodiments about 2.5 or less, and in some embodiments, from about -2.0 to about 2.4, as determined at a temperature of 25\u00b0C. The secondary antiviral agent is selected from the group consisting of an anionic N-acyl compound, metal halide salt, amine compound, aliphatic amine oxide, alkyl glycoside, alcohol ethoxylate, and combinations thereof. </p>By selectively controlling the particular nature of each antiviral agent and their relative concentration, the present inventors have discovered that a synergistic effect can be achieved in which the disinfectant composition is capable of exhibiting antiviral efficacy against non-enveloped viruses, including members of the families Picornaviridae, Reoviridae, Caliciviridae, Papovaviridae, </p>Adenoviridae and Parvoviridae. Members of these families include rhinovirus, poliovirus, adenovirus, hepatitis A virus, norovirus, coxsackie, enterovirus, papillomavirus, and rotavirus. For example, after being exposed to a non-enveloped virus for only 10 minutes, the disinfectant composition can exhibit a reduction in virus infectivity of about 30% or more, in some embodiments about 50% or more, in some embodiments about 70% or more, and in some embodiments, from about 75 to about 99%, such as determined according to the test methods described herein. In one embodiment, for instance, the disinfectant composition may exhibit a reduction after only 10 minutes within the ranges noted above against Phi X174 (ATCC 13706-B1), a non-enveloped bacteriophage. In another embodiment, the disinfectant composition may exhibit a reduction after only 10 minutes within the ranges noted above against feline calicivirus. Of course, the composition is also capable of inactivating other </p>microorganisms, such as gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, fungi, parasites, enveloped viruses, etc. </p> Various embodiments of the present invention will now be described in more detail below. I. Disinfectant Composition </p> A. Primary Antirviral Agent </p> The primary antiviral agent employed in the disinfectant composition includes one or more acids having a low pk<sub>a</sub>i value of about 3.0 or less, in some embodiments about 2.5 or less, and in some embodiments, from about -2.0 to about 2.4, as determined at a temperature of 25\u00b0C. The acid is also polyprotic in the sense that it contains more than one mole of ionizable hydronium ions per mole of acid. The acid may likewise be organic or inorganic in nature. Specific examples of suitable polyprotic acids that have a low first dissociation constant include, for instance, organic acids, such as \n\n carboxylic acids (e.g., maleic acid (pk<sub>a</sub>i of 1.9) and/or sulfosuccinic acid (pk<sub>a</sub>i of -1.65)); inorganic acids, such as phosphoric acid (pk<sub>a</sub>i of 2.18); or combinations of the foregoing. Regardless of the particular type of acid employed, the primary antiviral agent, which may include one or more acids having the desired pk<sub>a</sub>i value, typically constitutes from about 0.1 wt.% to about 10 wt.%, in some embodiments from about 0.5 to about 8 wt.%, and in some embodiments, from about 0.8 wt.% to about 1.5 wt.% of the disinfectant composition. </p> B. Secondary Antiviral Agent </p> The secondary antiviral agent typically constitutes from about 0.1 wt.% to about 15 wt.%, in some embodiments from about 0.2 to about 10 wt.%, and in some embodiments, from about 0.5 to about 5 wt.% of the composition. As noted above, the secondary antiviral agent is selected from the group consisting of an anionic N-acyl compound, metal halide salt, amine compound, aliphatic amine oxide, alkyl glycoside, alcohol ethoxylate, as well as combinations thereof. The exact selection of the agent depends in part on the type of acid(s) employed for the primary antiviral agent. For example, the present inventors have discovered that anionic N-acyl compounds, metal halide salts, and amine compounds work particularly well with phosphoric acid. Likewise, anionic N-acyl compounds, metal halide salts, alcoho"
