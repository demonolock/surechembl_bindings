The list of conjugates prepared, as well as their structural characteristics, is summarized in Table 2. The chemical structures of the various payload moieties used, when linked to a cyclic peptidomimetic, are depicted in Scheme 2.

The ring size of the cyclic peptidomimetic was altered by \n\n changing two structural parameters of the cyclic compound, in particular, (i) the amino acid residue linked via its \u03b1- or side-chain carboxyl group to the backbone NH and via its \u03b1- or side-chain amino group to the \u03b1-carboxyl group of the aspartic acid residue, i.e., Ai in the general formula I; and (ii) the radical bridging the backbone carbonyl and the backbone NH, i.e., radical X in the general formula I.

The strong biological activity of conjugate 33, compared with that of conjugate 32, may be due to the distance of four methylene units between the peptidomimetic ring and the payload moiety, which gives more freedom to the peptidomimetic ring to interact with the binding site of the integrin.</p>On the other hand, Example 6 shows that BTA-conjugates comprising cyclic peptidomimetics of the general formula I in which an urea moiety is formed with the \u03b1-amino of the arginine residue had a biological activity similar to that of the corresponding conjugates in which a carbamate moiety is formed, indicating that the nature of the moiety formed with the \u03b1-amino of the arginine residue has no effect on the biological activity of the conjugate.</p>Example 7 describes the synthesis of four unmetalated bacteriochlorophyll derivative-conjugates herein identified by the Arabic numbers 37-40, consisting of different \u03b1<sub>v</sub>\u03b2<sub>3</sub> and \u03b1<sub>v</sub>\u03b2<sub>5</sub> integrin ligands of the general formula I linked directly to a BTA derivative moiety in which the taurine was replaced by a different nucleophile.

Secondary rabbit FITC-labeled anti-mouse IgG (1 :200) (Sigma, Israel) were applied to cells for 1 hr at RT.

The ring size of a cyclic peptidomimetic of the general formula I affects the biological activity of the conjugate based thereon</p>In order to examine whether the ring size of the RGD-containing cyclic peptidomimetic of the general formula I affects the biological activity of the conjugate, the activity of various fluorescent probe-conjugates based on cyclic peptidomimetics of the general formula I having different ring size was tested in both in vivo ovarian carcinoma model and in vitro binding assay using human ovarian carcinoma cells, as described in Materials and Methods. \n\n The ring size of the RGD-containing cyclic peptidomimetic was changed by altering two structural parameters of the cyclic compound, in particular, (i) the amino acid residue linked by amide bonds via its \u03b1- or side-chain carboxyl group to the backbone NH and via its \u03b1- or side-chain amino group to the \u03b1-carboxyl group of the aspartic acid residue, i.e., radical A<sub>1</sub> in the general formula I; and (ii) the radical bridging the backbone carbonyl and the backbone NH, i.e., radical X in the general formula I. The specific amino acid residues used were residues of diaminopropionic acid (Dap), diaminobutyric acid (Dab), ornithine (Orn) and lysine (Lys), having one to four methylene units, respectively, in the side chain; and the different radicals X used were NH, NH(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, NH(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, NH(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub> and NH(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>, which, together with the backbone NH, form a moiety of hydrazine, diaminoethane, diaminopropane, diaminobutane and diaminohexane, respectively, bridging A<sub>1</sub> and the backbone carbonyl.</p>Table 3 shows the various fluorescent probe-conjugates tested and the biological activity thereof. As shown, the activity of the conjugates tested increased with increasing the ring size of the cyclic peptidomimetic from 16 atoms to 18-20 atoms; however, it decreased with further increasing the ring size. These results indicate that whereas the urea bond bridging the \u03b1-amino group of the arginine residue and radical X makes the cyclic peptidomimetic more rigid, a larger ring having up to 18-20 atoms is more flexible to adopt the desired conformation for binding to the integrin. On the other hand, in cases wherein the ring size of the cyclic peptidomimetic is higher than 20 atoms, the cyclic peptidomimetic probably cannot adopt the desired conformation for binding to the integrin. \n\n</p>Table 3: The biological activity of fluorescent probe-conjugates based on cyclic peptidomimetics of the general formula I having different ring size \n\n</p>The characterization of each conjugate is presented in Table 1 hereinbefore. \n\n Example 4. The size and structure of the diamine residue in a cyclic peptidomimetic of the general formula I affects the biological activity of the conjugate based thereon</p>In order to examine whether the size and structure of the diamine residue, linked by amide bonds to either the \u03b1- or side-chain carboxyl group of the amino acid residue Ai in the general formula I and, via the backbone carbonyl, to the \u03b1- amino group of the arginine residue, affects the biological activity of the conjugate, the activity of various BTA-conjugates based on cyclic peptidomimetics of the general formula I having different diamine residues as defined above was tested in both in vivo ovarian carcinoma model and in vitro binding assay using human ovarian carcinoma cells, as described in Materials and Methods.</p>The specific conjugates tested were conjugates 4, 24, 25, 15 and 23, in which the amino acid residue Ai is ornithine; the BTA molecule is linked to the N- terminal of the peptidomimetic ring without a spacer; and the radical designated X in the general formula I is -NH(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>-<sub>4</sub>-, l,3-dimethylbenzene-l,3-diyl or piperidine- 1 ,4-diyl, respectively.</p>Table 4 shows the various conjugates tested and the biological activity thereof. As shown, the biological activity of conjugate 4 was the highest among the conjugates in which alkyldiamine residues are bridging Ai and the backbone C=O, indicating that the biological activity of these conjugates decrease as the length of the alkyl chain increase. Furthermore, when the peptidomimetic ring becomes rigid, as in the cases of conjugates 15 and 23 wherein radicals other than alkyldiamine residues were used, no biological activity was measured, indicating that the peptidomimetic ring in such conjugates adopts a conformation that is undesirable for the interaction with the integrin. \n\n Table 4: The biological activity of BTA-conjugates based on cyclic peptidomimetics of the general formula I having different diamine units linking via amide bonds the arginine residue and the amino acid residue designated A<sub>1</sub></p></p>The characterization of each conjugate is presented in Table 1 hereinbefore.</p>Example 5. The spacer linking the payload moiety to a cyclic peptidomimetic of the general formula I affects the biological activity of the conjugate</p>In this experiment, the biological activity of various fluorescent probe- conjugates based on cyclic peptidomimetics of the general formula I having different spacers linking the fluorescent probe moiety and the N-terminal of the cyclic peptidomimetic, i.e., either the \u03b1- or side-chain amino group of the amino acid residue Ai, was tested in both in vivo ovarian carcinoma model and in vitro binding assay using human ovarian carcinoma cells, as described in Materials and Methods. The specific spacers used were moieties of various natural or synthetic amino acids, in particular, glycine, \u03b2-alanine, phenylalanine, D-phenylalanine, 1- naphthylalanine (1-Nal), D-1-naphthylalanine (D-I-NaI), \u03b3-aminobutiric acid (GABA) and 3-(aminomethyl) benzoic acid.</p>Table 5 shows the various conjugates tested and the biological activity thereof. As shown, Conjugate 1 having no spacer between the BTA molecule and the cyclic peptidomimetic showed high biological activity, probably due to the fact \n\n that the BTA molecule does not interfere with the binding of the cyclic peptidomimetic to the integrin. Contrary to that, conjugates in which glycine or \u03b2- alanine moieties were used as spacers, having an increased distance between the cyclic peptidomimetic and the BTA molecule, showed lower biological activity, probably because of the bulkiness of the BTA molecule. In the case of conjugate 11, in which a GABA moiety was used as a spacer, i.e., the distance between the cyclic peptidomimetic and the BTA molecule was further increased, both in vitro and in vivo results showed high fluorescence, possibly indicating that GABA is long enough for giving more freedom to the peptidomimetic ring to bind to the integrin; however, not too long to cause folding of the BTA molecule over the peptidomimetic ring.</p>In cases smaller fluorescent probes, i.e., FITC or dansyl, were used, the distance bet",

The biological activity of the conjugates was tested in colon carcinoma model as well as in ovarian carcinoma in both in vivo and in vitro binding assay using human ovarian carcinoma cells, as described in Materials and Methods.</p>The biological activity of conjugates 1 and 5 in ovarian carcinoma model is described in Table 3. As shown in Table 6, the conjugates in which an urea moiety is formed with the \u03b1-amino group of the arginine residue had a similar activity to that of the corresponding conjugates in which a carbamate moiety is formed, indicating that the nature of the moiety formed with the \u03b1-amino group of the arginine residue does not affect the biological activity of the conjugate. \n\n</p>Table 6: The biological activity of BTA-conjugates based on cyclic peptidomimetics of the general formula I in which an urea vs. a carbamate moiety is formed with the \u03b1-amino group of the arginine residue</p></p>The characterization of each conjugate is presented in Table 1 hereinbefore.</p>Example 7.

After cyclization and Dde removal, a solution of \n\n Bpheide (2 eq), activated by PyBoP (2 eq), HOBt (2 eq), DIEA (6 eq) in DMF was added to the peptidyl resin and shaken for 2 hrs under argon. The resin was washed with DMF eight times (monitoring by ninhydrin test). A solution of diamine (30 eq) in DMF was added to the peptidyl resin and shaken for 1 hr under argon followed by DMF wash. The peptide was cleaved from the resin as described in Materials and Methods, and the crude conjugates were purified by RP-HPLC. As shown in Table 7, the biological activity of all these conjugates was similar, indicating that in these cases, the amino group has no effect on the biological activity and its behavior is nearly the same as that of the sulphonate in taurin.</p>Table 7: The biological activity of various substituted BTA-conjugates based on cyclic peptidomimetics of the general formula I</p></p>X and A] are defined according to the definitions of the general formula I. * J represents the specific nucleophile replacing taurine in BTA.</p>Example 8: The ring size of a cyclic peptidomimetic of the general formula II affects the biological activity of the conjugate based thereon</p>In order to examine whether the ring size of the cyclic peptidomimetic of the general formula II affects the biological activity of the conjugate, the activity of various BTA-conjugates based on cyclic peptidomimetics of the general formula II having the same amino acid residues A<sub>1</sub> (Lys) and A<sub>2</sub> (Phe), but different amino acid residues A<sub>3</sub>, in particular, Dap, Dab, Orn and Lys, having one to four methylene units, respectively, in the side chain, was tested in both in vivo ovarian carcinoma model and in vitro binding assay using human ovarian carcinoma cells, as described in Materials and Methods. \n\n Table 8 shows the various BTA-conjugates tested and the biological activity thereof. As shown, the biological activity of the conjugates tested decreased with increasing the ring size of the cyclic peptidomimetic from 20 atoms to 23 atoms, indicating that a ring size larger than 20 atoms does not fit the binding site of the integrin.</p>Table 8: The biological activity of BTA-conjugates based on cyclic peptidomimetic of the general formula II having different ring size</p></p>The characterization of each conjugate is presented in Table 2 hereinbefore.</p>Example 9: The characteristics of the amino acid residue A<sub>2</sub> in a cyclic peptidomimetic of the general formula II affects the biological activity of the conjugate based thereon</p>In order to examine whether the size and the structure of the amino acid residue A<sub>2</sub> in the cyclic peptidomimetic of the general formula II, linked via its \u03b1- amino group to the backbone C=O and via its \u03b1-carboxyl group to the amino acid residue A<sub>3</sub>, affects the biological activity of the conjugate, the activity of various BTA-conjugates based on cyclic peptidomimetics of the general formula II having the same amino acid residues A<sub>1</sub> (Lys) and A<sub>3</sub> (Dap), but different amino acid residues A<sub>2</sub>, in particular, Phe, VaI, D-Phe, GIy and Asp, was tested in both in vivo ovarian carcinoma model and in vitro binding assay using human ovarian carcinoma cells, as described in Materials and Methods.</p>Table 9 shows the various BTA-conjugates tested and the biological activity thereof. As shown, the biological activity of conjugates 41, 42 and 43, having hydrophobic amino acid residues A<sub>2</sub>, was higher than that of conjugates 44 and 45, which are more polar, possibly due to the hydrophobic interactions with the \n\n hydrophobic pocket in the binding site of the integrin. The fact that conjugate 43 was less active than conjugate 41 may be due to the configuration of the former, suggesting that the D configuration does not fit completely to the hydrophobic pocket.</p>Table 9: The biological activity of BTA-conjugates based on cyclic peptidomimetic of the general formula II having different amino acid residues A<sub>2</sub></p></p><sup>*</sup> The characterization of each conjugate is presented in Table 2 hereinbefore.</p>Example 10.
