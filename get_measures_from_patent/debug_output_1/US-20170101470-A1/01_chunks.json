    "rs, NY, 1987). A number of suitable host cell lines capable of secreting intact heterologous proteins have been developed in the art, and include CHO cell lines, various COS cell lines, HeLa cells, HEK293 cells, L cells, and non-antibody-producing myelomas including Sp2/0 and NS0. It can be advantageous to use nonhuman cells. Expression vectors for these cells can include expression control sequences, such as an origin of replication, a promoter, an enhancer (Queen et al., Immunol. Rev. 89:49 (1986)), and necessary processing information sites, such as ribosome binding sites, RNA splice sites, polyadenylation sites, and transcriptional terminator sequences. Suitable expression control sequences are promoters derived from endogenous genes, cytomegalovirus, SV40, adenovirus, bovine papillomavirus, and the like. See Co et al., J. Immunol. 148:1149 (1992).</p>Having introduced vector(s) encoding antibody heavy and light chains into cell culture, cell pools can be screened for growth productivity and product quality in serum-free media. Top-producing cell pools can then be subjected to FACS-based single-cell cloning to generate monoclonal lines. Specific productivities above 50 pg or 100 pg per cell per day, which correspond to product titers of greater than 7.5 g/L culture, can be advantageous. Antibodies produced by single cell clones can also be tested for turbidity, filtration properties, PAGE, IEF, UV scan, HP-SEC, carbohydrate-oligosaccharide mapping, mass spectrometry, and binding assay, such as ELISA or Biacore. A selected clone can then be banked in multiple vials and stored frozen for subsequent use.</p>Once expressed, antibodies can be purified according to standard procedures of the art, including protein A capture, column chromatography (e.g., hydrophobic interaction or ion exchange), low-pH for viral inactivation and the like (see generally, Scopes, Protein Purification (Springer-Verlag, NY, 1982)).</p>Methodology for commercial production of antibodies including codon optimization, selection of promoters, transcription elements, and terminators, serum-free single cell cloning, cell banking, use of selection markers for amplification of copy number, CHO terminator, serum free single cell cloning, improvement of protein titers (see, e.g., U.S. Pat.

Nucleic AcidsThe disclosure further provides nucleic acids encoding any of the heavy and light chains described above. Typically, the nucleic acids also encode a signal peptide fused to the mature heavy and light chains (e.g., signal peptides having amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NOs:163, 165, and 167 that can be encoded by SEQ ID NOS:162, 164, and 166). Coding sequences on nucleic acids can be in operable linkage with regulatory sequences to ensure expression of the coding sequence",
    " pre-incubated with isotype control antibody, or 10 \u03bcg/mL of the test monoclonal antibody for 30 minutes in PBS. The mixture was added to healthy spinal cord tissue sections and subsequently characterized by fluorescence microscopy as described in Materials and Methods above. Furthermore, parental CHO cells (CHOK1) or CHO cells transfected with a human MCAM gene were preincubated with CHO culture media (DMEM), recombinant laminin 411 (10 \u03bcg/ml), or recombinant laminin 511 (i.e., laminin 10 (\u03b15\u03b21\u03b31)) (10 \u03bcg/ml) at 37\u00b0 C. for 45 minutes. Cells were washed, and specific binding of laminin 411, but not laminin 511, to MCAM was detected with a pan-laminin antibody by flow cytometry. Pre-incubation of human MCAM transfected CHO cells with the anti-MCAM antibody (at 20 \u03bcg/ml), prior to laminin incubation, abolished the binding of human MCAM to laminin 411.</p>Using this technique, it was shown that 87 of the 823 independent mouse fusion clones and 26 of the 152 independent rat fusion clones described above expressed an antibody that was capable of blocking the interaction between human MCAM protein and its ligand, \u03b1-4 chain of laminin.</p>Example 2. Further Characterization of Anti-MCAM Monoclonal AntibodiesThe 87 independent mouse fusion clones and 26 independent rat fusion clones described in Example 1 above as being capable of (i) binding to human MCAM, and (ii) blocking the interaction between human MCAM and the \u03b1-4 chain of laminin were further characterized as follows. First, IC50 quantitation for the ability of the monoclonal antibody to block the binding of human MCAM to the \u03b1-4 chain of laminin was determined as follows. CHO cells expressing human MCAM were incubated with an anti-human MCAM antibody (at various concentrations) for 30 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. Unbound antibody was then washed away, and the cells were incubated with recombinant human laminin 411 at 20 ug/ml for 45 minutes at 37 degrees Celsius. Unbound laminin was then washed away, and the laminin bound to the surface of the cells was detected with fluorescently labeled anti-laminin antibodies. After washing, the amount of laminin bound to the surface was detected by flow cytometry, and IC50s were calculated based on the mean fluorescent intensity.</p>Using the above described assay, six independent anti-human MCAM monoclonal antibody clones were identified as binding to human MCAM and having the greatest ability to block the interaction between human MCAM expressed on the surface of cells and its binding ligand, human laminin 411. These six anti-MCAM monoclonal antibody clones are herein referred to as (i) the mouse anti-human MCAM monoclonal clones 1174.1.3, 1414.1.2, 1415.1.1, and 1749.1.3, and (ii) the rat anti-human MCAM monoclonal antibody clones 2120.4.19 and 2107.4.10. Amino acid and nucleic acid sequences of the heavy and light chains of these antibodies, and their hypervariable regions, are provided in SEQ ID NOs:29-92. More specifically, in the above assay, IC50s f",

For those antibodies that contained N-deamidation motifs (NG), mutations to the asparagines or glycine were introduced into the standard version.

Biotinylated rodent or chimeric antibody was added at a subsaturating concentration, in the presence or absence of 3\u00d7 increasing concentrations of unlabeled competitor (humanized antibody, rodent, or chimeric). After washing to remove unbound antibody, streptavidin HRP was added to allow detection of the biotinylated antibody. The ELISA was developed with TMB substrate and the OD450 was measured.
