{"raw_mentions": "Unfortunately, there are no sentences that contain all four required components: a specific molecule name, a bioactivity metric, a specific numeric value, and a unit. The text provides some information about bioactivity metrics, such as IC50, but does not include specific numeric values with units for these metrics.\n\nHowever, I can provide some sentences that contain some of the required components, but not all:\n\n* CHO cells expressing human MCAM were incubated with an anti-human MCAM antibody (at various concentrations) for 30 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius.\n* Unbound antibody was then washed away, and the cells were incubated with recombinant human laminin 411 at 20 ug/ml for 45 minutes at 37 degrees Celsius.\n* Pre-incubation of human MCAM transfected CHO cells with the anti-MCAM antibody (at 20 \u03bcg/ml), prior to laminin incubation, abolished the binding of human MCAM to laminin 411.\n* Furthermore, parental CHO cells (CHOK1) or CHO cells transfected with a human MCAM gene were preincubated with CHO culture media (DMEM), recombinant laminin 411 (10 \u03bcg/ml), or recombinant laminin 511 (i.e., laminin 10 (\u03b15\u03b21\u03b31)) (10 \u03bcg/ml) at 37\u00b0 C. for 45 minutes.\n\nThese sentences do not meet the criteria because they do not contain all four required components. If you would like, I can try to help you find more information or provide further analysis."}
