    "caments for the treatment or prevention of thromboses, apoplexy, cardiac infarction, inflammation and arteriosclerosis or as antitmour agents.</p>Moreover, the invention relates to the use of a compound as described above for the production of medicaments containing a compound as described above for the treatment or prevention of thromboses, apoplexy, cardiac infarction, inflammation and arteriosclerosis or of antitmour agents.</p>The inhibition of the amidolytic activity of factor Vila/tissue factor complex by the compounds in accordance with the invention can be demonstrated with the aid of a chromogenic peptide substrate as described hereinafter.</p>The measurements were carried out on microtitre plates at room temperature. To this end, 100 \u03bcl of a solution of 26 nM of tissue factor, 9 nM of soluble factor Vila and</p>8 mM of calcium chloride were added to 25 \u03bcl of a solution of the inhibitor in a buffer [pH 7.5, 100 mM, comprising 0J4M NaCl, 0JM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine- N'-(2-ethanesulphonic acid) (HEPES), 0.5 mg/1 of fatty-acid-free BSA (bovine serum albumin) and 0.05% NaN<sub>3</sub>] in each well of the plate. After an incubation time of 15 minutes the reaction was started by the addition of 50 \u03bcl of chromogenic substrate</p>Chromozym-tPA (3.5 mM, MeSO<sub>2</sub>-D-Phe-Gly-Arg-paranitroanilide) and the hydrolysis of the substrate was followed spectrophotometrically on a kinetic microtitre plate reader over 10 minutes. Using the plot of the inhibition curves, the Ki values were determined \n\naccording to the method described in Biochem. J. 55, 1953, 170-171. The results will be evident from the following Table (Ki in \u03bcM/1):</p>Example Ki 4 e 0.061</p>15 0.084</p>17 0.0385</p>26 e 0.1144</p>The activity of the low molecular weight substances can, moreover, be characterized in the \"prothrombin time\" (PT) clotting test. The substances are prepared as a 10 mM solution in DMSO or DMSO/0.1M HC1 (DHC1) and thereafter made up to the desired dilution in the same solvent. Thereafter, 0.25 ml of human plasma (obtained from whole blood anticoagulated with 1/10 volume of 108 mM Na citrate) was placed in the instrument-specific sample container. In each case 5 \u03bcl of each dilution of the substance- dilution series was then mixed with the plasma provided. This plasma/ inhibitor mixture was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 minutes. Thereafter, there were pipetted to the semiautomatic device (ACL, Automated Coagulation Laboratory (Instrument Laboratory))</p>50 \u03bcl of plasma/ inhibitor mixture in the measurement container. The clotting reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.1 ml of Innovin<sup>\u00ae</sup> (recombinant human tissue factor combined with calcium buffer and synthetic phospholipids( Dade Behring\u00ae, Inc.). The time up to the fibrin cross-linking was determined photooptically from the ACL. The inhibitor concentration, which brought about a doubling of the PT clotting time, was determined by means of a graph.</p>The Ki value of the compounds of the present invention preferably amounts to about 0.1 to 500 nM, especially about 0.1 to 100 nM. The PT values preferably amount to about 0.1 to 10 \u03bcM, especially to about 0.1 to 5 \u03bcM.</p>As mentioned earlier, medicaments containing a compound of formula I, a solvate or a salt thereof also form an object of the present invention, as does a process for the production of such medicaments which comprises bringing one or more of such compounds, solvates or salts and, if desired, other therapeutically useful substances into a galenical administration form. These medicaments can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions, or \n\nrectally, for example in the form of suppositories, or as a spray. However, administration can also be carried out parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.</p>For the production of tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules, the active ingredient can be mixed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic excipients. Suitable excipients for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules are, for example, lactose, maize starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts. Suitable excipients for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols; depending on the nature of the active ingredient no excipients are, however, usually required in the cas",
