    "logical malignancies and were euthanized. Lymph nodes and spleens were collected and used to generate single cell suspensions. A fraction of those cells were stained with antibodies to B220 and IgM. The panels represent the results of the flow cytometric analysis performed on those cells. The tumors were composed of mature, activated (blasting) B-cells, similar to what we observed in our mouse models of Burkitt's lymphoma, that yielded MYC-driven, antigen dependent tumors composed of mature, activated B-cells.</p>FIG. 9. Western blot analysis of reactivity of serum obtained from retroviral chimeric mice. TRE-MYC bone marrow derived HSCs were transduced with pMIG-tTA and pMIG-H5. The transduced cells were used to reconstitute cohorts of lethally irradiated mice. The mice began to exhibit externally evident clinical signs of hematological malignancies and were euthanized. Blood was collected shortly after euthanasia, and allowed to clot in order to obtain the serum. In order to test reactivity to H5 HA, 293FT cells were transiently transfected with either pMIG, pcDNA2-H5 or pMIG-H5 (the same plasmid used to generate the chimeric mice). The cells were collected 48 hours after transfection and lysed with a Triton X-100 based lysis buffer, as previously described. The lysates were run on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto PVDF membrane. The blots were probed with the serum obtained from the retroviral chimeric mice at a dilution of 1:5000. The lower molecular weight band (19 Kd) is non-specific and serves as a good loading control in this instance). Specific bands recognized by the serum represent the predicted molecular weight for the uncleaved (HA0) H5 (\u02dc60 kDa) and the HA1 subunit (\u02dc40 kDa) that results from cleavage of HA0 by furin protease during processing in the ER.</p>FIG. 10. Hemagglutination inhibition analysis of mouse serum obtained from retroviral chimeric mice. Sera isolated from three mice (1-3), 6 to 8 weeks after H5/tTA BM transduction, or phosphate buffered saline [PBS] (C1) was diluted serially across microtiter plates in duplicate wells. Following serial dilution, 4 agglutinating units of influenza A viruses A/Mal/WI/944/82 (H5N2), A/NY/1469/02 (H1N1), or PBS (No virus) were added to each well and incubated for 30 min. Next turkey red blood cells were added and incubated for 30 minutes to detect hemagglutination activity. The first column contains a final serum concentration of 1:20.</p>FIG. 11. Antibodies were obtained from mice immunized with HEL and CFA (Complete Freund's Adjuvant), or HEL and TAT-Myc. Antibodies obtained from mice immunized with HEL and TAT-Myc are detected earlier and produced a more robust response.</p>FIG. 12. Antibodies were obtained from mice immunized with HEL and CFA (Complete Freund's Adjuvant), or HEL and TAT-Myc on day 0. The mice were administered a booster shot of antigen on day 30. Mice immunized with HEL and TAT-Myc demonstrated improved host recall response to the HEL antigen.</p>FIG. 13. An"
