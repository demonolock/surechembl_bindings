Med. Chem. 2001, 44, 1674-1689 by bromination of the corresponding toluene derivative, which is in turn obtained as described in J. Fluorine Chemistry, 2000. 101:85-89.</p>The first step concerns the formation of the sulfonamido bond (4) obtained by condensation of intermediates (2) and (3). This reaction is carried out at room temperature, preferably in acetonitrile/water (2:1), in the presence of sodium hydrogen carbonate (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>). Said reaction takes place with exchange of chlorine and bromine at the benzyl position: the resulting products mixture is directly used in the subsequent step. The reaction of the halogen derivatives mixture with a disubstituted hydroxyquinoline (5), in the presence of potassium carbonate (K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) and potassium iodide (KI), in acetone under reflux, yields the ester derivative (6).</p>Compound of formula (5) i.e. 2,4-dimethyl-8-hydroxy quinoline, in which R<sub>4</sub>=R<sub>5</sub>=CH<sub>3</sub>, is prepared as disclosed in WO9640639</patcit>.</p>The methyl ester of formula (6) is hydrolysed under basic conditions to carboxylic acid (7), which is condensed with Boc-piperazine (8), to yield intermediate (9). Said condensation reaction is carried out according to a known procedure for the peptide synthesis, using hydroxybenzotriazole to activate the carboxylic moiety, a condensing agent such as 1-ethyl-3-(3'-dimethylpropyl) carbodiimide and an amount of tertiary amine, namely diisopropylethylamine, of three equivalents on the basis of the condensing agent. Compound (II) is obtained by cleavage of the Boc group from intermediate (9), by means of a hydrochloric acid solution (4N) in dioxane and isolating the free amine instead of the hydrochloride.</p>Derivative (11) is obtained by condensation of intermediate (10) with the amino acid (11) according the procedure described for the preparation of (9) from (7). Any Boc group present can be removed from intermediate (11), with a hydrochloric acid solution (4N) in dioxane, thus obtaining the final compound. When case the trialkylammonium group is not present in any commercially available intermediates, it can be synthesized starting from the corresponding amine with known procedures (Rapoport et al, J. Org. Chem, 1977, 42:139-141; Chen et al, J. B",
