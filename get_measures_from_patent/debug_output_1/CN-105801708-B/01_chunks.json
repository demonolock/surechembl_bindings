    "e parameter of born of the same parents' instrument, cell count are 10000, calculate cell average fluorescent strength (Mean Fluorescence\nIntensity, MFI), and using the Overlay function in software, it is overlapped the integrogram of each laboratory sample, has been seen whether\nFluorescence is moved back.</p>Fluorescence polarization experiment</p>In 96 orifice plates of black, the small molecule of certain density mark fluorescent is added, by the target of various concentration gradient\nAlbumen is added in the hole containing fluorescent small molecule, and is added with PBS solution to 200 \u03bc L, is protected from light incubation after a certain period of time, is utilized\nThe fluorescence polarization modular program (Fluorescence Plorization) of multi-function microplate reader is detected, and exciting light is\n440nm/40, transmitting light are 485nm/20.3 controls are arranged in each sample.Record the readings I of the parallel light direction measured<sub>||</sub>With\nThe readings I \u2534 of vertical optical direction.And fluorescence polarization rate F is calculated with formula,</p></p>And by formula, Tau albumen and the K of CF-TH006 are obtained<sub>D</sub>Value:</p></p>F represents fluorescence polarization value\uff1bF<sub>max</sub>, represent maximum fluorescence polarization value\uff1bF<sub>min</sub>, represent minimum fluorescence polarization value\uff1bE<sub>0</sub>, represent\nThe total concentration of Tau albumen\uff1bA<sub>0</sub>, represent CF-TH006\uff1bK<sub>D</sub>, represent dissociation constant.</p>Immunoprecipitation (Immunoprecipitation, IP) and western blot hybridization (Western Bllotting) experiment</p>After cell pyrolysis liquid carries out protein concentration quantitatively, the albumen of identical total amount is taken to carry out immunoprecipitation experiment\n(Immunoprecipitation, IP).By the identical sample of Tot Prot, a certain amount of PBS buffer solution is added, with equal amount\nAntibody carry out total incubation, 4 DEG C are jiggled overnight.Then the globule of the Protein A+G of equivalent is added, carries out total incubation, 4\nIt DEG C jiggles about 8 hours.2500rpm after incubation, 4 DEG C are centrifuged 10 minutes, gently discard supernatant.It is slow with the PBS of pre-cooling\nFliud flushing gently washs globule 5 times of Protein A+G, gently discards supernatant.20 \u03bc L sample-loading buffers are finally added to absorption\nIn the globule of antibody and albumen, heating is boiled after ten minutes, and all samples are all loaded in SDS-PAGE glue, carries out electricity\nSwimming, then transferring film, carries out Western Blotting experiment.Buffer containing primary antibody is added to the plastic packaging bag of coated film\nIn, 4 DEG C are jiggled overnight.It is washed 4 times, every time 15 minutes with TBST buffer afterwards.Addition couples horseradish peroxidase\nSecondary antibody, antibody are added to according to a certain percentage in diluted TBST buffer, secondary antibody with 4 DEG C of fi",
    "MS detections of TH003\nAs a result, G, H are HPLC the and MS testing results of TH004, and I, J are HPLC the and MS testing results of TH005, and K, L are TH006\nHPLC and MS testing result.</p>In order to further detect above-mentioned synthesis polypeptide can Tau protein degradation in inducing cell, turn first with gene\nDye cell technology constructs the N2a cell line for being overexpressed Tau-EGFP albumen, and above-mentioned synthesis polypeptide was respectively acting on for 100 \u03bcM\nThe cell (preparation method is as described in Example 1) of expression Tau-EGFP is incubated for 24 hours altogether, using flow cytometry, detects cell\nIn fluorescence values, detect TH003, TH004, TH005, TH006 can reduce glimmering in the cell for being overexpressed Tau-EGFP\nLuminous intensity, and polypeptide (TH001 and TH002), substantially without effect, experimental result is as shown in the A and E of Fig. 2.In following embodiment\nIn, it is made further research by taking TH006 as an example.</p>Embodiment 3 verify TH006 can with Tau protein-interacting and cell can be entered</p>Firstly, using fluorescence polarization experiment, by the TH006 of 0.1 \u03bcM of Fluoresceincarboxylic acid label (CF-TH006, be shown in Table 1) with\nAfter the Tau albumen (using prokaryotic expression people overall length Tau albumen) that concentration gradually rises carries out total incubation half an hour, using microplate reader\nIts fluorescence polarization value is detected, Tau albumen and the dissociation constant K of CF-TH006 are calculated by formula<sub>D</sub>Value for 0.3944 \u00b1\n0.1589 \u03bcM, as a result as shown in the B of Fig. 2, and the control peptide CF-CP1 of Fluoresceincarboxylic acid label cannot interact with Tau, tie\nFruit is as shown in Figure 3.Cell, the TH006, (CF-TH006,200 \u03bc that Fluoresceincarboxylic acid is marked can be entered in order to detect TH006\nM total incubation different time) is carried out with the N2a cell of wild type, flow cytomery is the results show that as incubation time prolongs\nLong, CF-TH006 progresses into cell, and the fluorescence signal value in cell gradually increases, as a result as shown in the C of Fig. 2 and F.Laser is total\nFocusing microscope result again shows that CF-TH006 is able to enter cell, and is distributed in cytoplasm, molten there are also being partially distributed in\nIn enzyme body, as a result as shown in the A of the D of Fig. 2 and Fig. 4.</p>Embodiment 4TH006 induces Tau protein degradation</p>In order to further confirm TH006 can Tau protein degradation in inducing cell, inventor is by the TH006 of various concentration\nTotal incubation 24 hours is carried out with the N2a cell for being overexpressed Tau-EGFP, flow cytometry results show the liter with TH006 concentration\nHeight, fluorescence signal gradually decrease.Show to increase with TH006 concentration using Flow cytometry, the content of Tau albumen is gradually\nIt reduces, as a result as shown in the A of Fig. 5 and C, shows that th"
