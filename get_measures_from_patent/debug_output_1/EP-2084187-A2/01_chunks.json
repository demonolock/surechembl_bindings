Reference is made to the prior art cited herein.</p>\n  Other binding units or binding molecules for example include, without limitation, molecules based on other protein scaffolds than immunoglobulins including but not limited to protein A domains, tendamistat, fibronectin, lipocalin, CTLA-4, T-cell receptors, designed ankyrin repeats and PDZ domains (Binz et al, Nat.

Comb Chem High Throughput Screen 2006 9(8):619-32).</p>\n  In a first aspect, the invention relates to an amino acid sequence (also referred to herein as: \"an amino acid sequence of the invention\") that is directed against a desired molecule, wherein said amino acid sequence: a) binds to a desired molecule under a first biological condition with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>\"5</sup> moles/liter or less; and b) binds to said desired molecule under a second biological condition with a dissociation constant (KD) that is at least 10 fold different from (and in particular more than) the \n\n dissociation constant with which said amino acid sequence binds to said desired molecule under said first biological condition.</p>\n  The invention also relates to compounds (as defined herein) that comprise at least one amino acid sequence of the invention. Such compounds are also referred to herein as \"compounds of the invention\")</p>\n  Other aspects and embodiments of the invention will become clear from the further description herein.</p>\n  In the present description and claims, the term \"biological condition\" refers to the condition (or set of conditions) that may occur in the body (e.g. in at least one cell, tissue, organ or biological fluid, such as blood or lymphatic fluid) of an animal (and in particular of a mammal, such as a mouse, rat, rabbit, dog or primate) or human being, which may be a healthy animal or human being or an animal or human being that is suffering from a disease or disorder. The term \"biological condition\" also encompasses the conditions of in vitro or cellular assays or models that correspond to and/or are representative for conditions that may occur in the body of an animal or human being. Such conditions (whether occurring in vivo in a human or animal body or ex vivo in an in vitro or cellular assay or model) will be clear to the skilled person.</p>\n  It will also be clear from the disclosure herein that the \"first biological condition\" will differ in at least one respect from the \"second biological condition\". For example, the first biological",
    "ntracellular or subcellular compartment that is involved in the recycling of the protein or polypeptide).</p>\n  As another non-limiting example of this aspect of the invention, the amino acid sequence of the invention may be directed against a protein or polypeptide on the surface of a cell that is subject to recycling by said cell (such as a receptor), and the first biological condition may comprise the conditions that are prevalent at the cell surface or in the immediate surroundings of said cell of the animal or human body, and the second biological condition may comprise the conditions that are prevalent inside said cell (i.e. the conditions in the ceil or the conditions in one intracellular or subcellular compartment thereof, such as the conditions within an endosome or a vesicle within the cell, and in particular within an intracellular or subcellular compartment that is involved in the recycling of the protein or polypeptide). \n\n This aspect (including the two specific examples thereof) may also allow targeting of the amino acid sequence of the invention (or a compound comprising the same, as further described herein) towards specific cells or tissues into which the desired molecule is taken up by internalization, pinocytosis, transcytosis or endocytosis (whether as part of recycling or otherwise). Outside the cell, the amino acid sequence or compound of the invention will bind to the desired molecule with high affinity or avidity (i.e. with an association constant or dissociation constant as described herein for binding under the first biological condition), and will thus be taken up into the cell while bound to the desired molecule. Upon such internalization, pinocytosis, transcytosis or endocytosis, the affinity or avidity of the amino acid sequence or compound of the invention for the desired compound will be reduced (i.e. to an association constant or dissociation constant as described herein for binding under the second biological condition), so that the amino acid sequence or compound is released from the desired molecule and can perform its intended or desired biological, physiological, pharmaceutical or therapeutic action in the cell. Generally, as will be clear to the skilled person, this mechanism may also be used to allow an amino acid sequence or compound of the invention to cross the cell membrane of a cell and to enter into said cell, and may also be used for intracellular targeting of a compound of the invention.</p>\n  According to another specific but non-limiting aspect, the first biological condition and the second biological condition may differ in respect of pH, in which said first biological condition may comprise a physiological pH of more than 7.0, for example a pH of more than 7.1 or a pH of more than 7.2, such as a pH in the range of 7.2 to 7.4; and the second biological condition may comprise a physiological pH of less than 7.0, for example a pH of less than 6.7 or a pH of less than 6.5, such as a pH in the range of 6.5 to 6.0 (or vise versa). According to yet another specific but non-limiting aspect, the first biological condition and the second biological condition may differ in respect of the number and type of proteases. The susceptibility of an amino acid sequence towards protease degradation is highly variable and sequence and protein dependent, the level of protein degradation in vivo will be d",
    "e extracellular space and in the bloodstream, many other proteases (e.g. serine proteases) are active. \n\n According to another specific, but non-limiting aspect, the first and second biological condition differ in respect of any two, any three or essentially all of the following factors: pH, ionic strength, protease contents; in which said factors may be and/or may differ as described herein, According to another specific, but non-limiting aspect, the first biological condition may comprise the physiological conditions that are prevalent in a first physiological compartment or fluid, and the second biological condition comprises the physiological conditions that are prevalent in a second physiological compartment or fluid, wherein the first and second physiological compartments or fluids are, under normal physiological conditions, separated by at least one biological membrane such as cell membrane, a wall of a cellular vesicle or a subcellular compartment, or a wall of a blood vessel, wherein the conditions prevalent in the first physiological compartment or fluid and the conditions prevalent in the second physiological compartment or fluid differ in respect of any two, any three or essentially all of the following factors: pH, ionic strength, protease contents; in which said factors may be and/or may differ as described herein.</p>\n  As will be clear from the description herein, the amino acid sequences and compounds of the invention are such that they bind with a different dissociation constant or association constant (which are as defined herein) to their respective desired molecules under the first and second biological conditions, respectively. This is generally referred to herein as \"conditional binding\", and amino acid sequences that show such conditional binding are also referred to herein as \"conditional\" amino acid sequences (such as, for example, \"conditional Nanobodies\") or as \"conditional binders\".</p>\n  The conditional amino acid sequences of the invention (as well as compounds comprising the same) are preferably such that they bind to their intended or desired molecule under the second biological condition (or set of biological conditions) with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) that is at least 10 times more, more preferably 100 fold more, more preferably at least 1000 fold more, than the dissociation constant with which the conditional amino acid sequence binds to its intended or desired molecule under the first biological condition (or set of biological conditions); and/or binds to its intended or desired molecule under the second biological condition (or set of biological conditions) with a binding affinity (K<sub>A</sub>) that is at least 10 times less, more preferably 100 times less, more preferably at least 1000 times less, than the binding affinity with which said amino acid sequence binds to said intended desired molecule under said first biological condition (or set of biological conditions). \n\n Thus, by means of illustration and without limitation, when the amino acid sequences of the invention may bind to said desired molecule under said first second biological condition with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of about 10<sup>\"7</sup> moles/liter and/or with a binding affinity (K<sub>A</sub>) of about 10<sup>7</sup> M<sup>4</sup>, the amino acid sequences of the invention bind to said desired molecule under said second biological condition with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of about 10<sup>\"6</sup> moles/liter or more and/or with a binding affinity (K<sub>A</sub>) of about 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>\"1</sup> or less, preferably with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of about 10\u00b0 moles/liter or more and/or with a binding affinity (K<sub>A</sub>) of about 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>\"!</sup> or less, and more preferably with a dissociation constant (Kj&gt;) of about 10<sup>~4</sup> moles/liter or more and/or with a binding affinity (K<sub>A</sub>) of about 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>\"1</sup> or less.</p>\n  In addition, the amino acid sequences and compounds of the invention are preferably such that they bind to said intended or desired molecule under said first biological condition with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>\"6</sup> moles/liter or less, more preferably with a dissociation constant (Kn) of 10<sup>\"7</sup> moles/liter or less , and even more preferably with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>\"</sup> moles/liter or less.</p>\n  Furthermore, the amino acid sequences or compounds of the invention are preferably such that they bind to said intended or desired molecule under said second biological condition with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>\"6</sup> moles/liter or more, more preferably with a dissociation constant (KQ) of 10<sup>'5</sup> moles/liter or more, and even more preferably with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>\"4</sup> moles/liter or more.</p>\n  The dissociation constant may be the actual or apparent dissociation constant, as will be clear to the skilled person. Methods for determining the dissociation constant will be clear to the skilled person, and for example include the techniques mentioned herein. In this respect, it will also be clear that it may not be possible to measure dissociation constants of more then 10<sup>\"4</sup> moles/liter or 10<sup>\"3</sup> moles/liter (e.g., of 10<sup>\"2</sup> moles/liter). Accordingly, when a dissociation constant cannot be measured, it will be deemed for the purposes of the present invention to be a dissociation constant that is at least 1000 fold more than a dissociation constant of 10<sup>\"5</sup> moles/liter.</p>\n  Optionally, as will also be clear to the skilled person, the (actual or apparent) dissociation constant may be calculated on the basis of the (actual or apparent) association constant (K<sub>A</sub>), by means of the relationship [K<sub>D</sub> = 1/K<sub>A</sub>]. For this purpose, methods for determining the association constant at a certain pH value will be clear to the skilled person, and for example include the techniques mentioned herein. Also, from this, it will be clear that \n\n the amino acid sequences of the invention may also be such that they bind to the said desired molecule under a second biological condition with a binding affinity (K<sub>A</sub>) that is at least 10 limes less than the binding affinity with which said amino acid sequence binds to said desired molecule under said first biological condition. The affinity denotes the strength or stability of a molecular interaction. The affinity is commonly given as by the Kd, or dissociation constant, which has units of mol/liter, noted in brief as M. The affinity can also be expressed as an association constant, Ka which equals 1/Kd and has units of (mol/liter)<sup>\" !</sup>, in brief M<sup>\"1</sup>. Throughout this document we will express the stability of molecular interaction by its Kd value. But it should be understood that in view of the relation Ka =1/Kd, specifying the strength of molecular interaction by its Kd value, automatically specifies also the Ka value. The Kd characterizes the strength of a molecular interaction also in a thermodynamic sense as it is related to the free energy (DG) of binding by the well known relation DG=RT. In(Kd) (equivalently DG=-RT.ln(Ka)), where R equals the gas constant, T equals the absolute temperature and In denotes the natural logarithm. The Kd of meaningful biological complexes are typically in the range of 10<sup>40</sup>M (0.1 nM) to 10<sup>'5</sup>M (lOOOOnM). The stronger an interaction is, the lower is its Kd.</p>\n  Kd can also be expressed as the ratio of the dissociation rate constant of a complex, denoted as k<sub>otf</sub>, to the rate of its association, denoted k<sub>on</sub>. In other words Kd=k<sub>0ff</sub>/k<sub>or\u03b9</sub>, Clearly Ka = k<sub>or</sub>/k<sub>off</sub>. The off-rate k<sub>Off</sub> has units s<sup>\"1</sup> (where s is the SI unit notation of second). The on- rate k<sub>on</sub> has units M<sup>'</sup>V<sup>1</sup>. The on-rate may vary between IG<sup>2</sup> IVfV<sup>1</sup> to about 10<sup>7</sup> IVfV<sup>1</sup>, approaching the diffusion-limited association rate constant for bimolecular interactions. The off-rate is related to the half-life of a given molecular interaction by the relation \n\n The off-rate may vary between 10<sup>6</sup> S<sup>\"1</sup> (near irreversible complex with a tj<sub>/2</sub> of multiple days) to Is<sup>\"1</sup> (t<sub>s/</sub>2=0.69 s). The affinity of a molecular interaction between two molecules can be measured via different techniques such the well the known surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor technique (e.g. Ober et al, Intern. Immunology, 13, 1551-1559, 2001 used a Biacore 3000 SPR biosensor to study the affinity of albumin for FcRn under various pH conditions) where one molecule is immobilized on the biosensor chip and the other molecule is passed over the immobilized molecule under flow conditions yielding k<sub>o\u03c0</sub>, k<sub>off</sub> measurements and hence Kd (or Ka) values.</p>\n  It should be noted that the measured Kd corresponds to an apparent Kd if the measuring process somehow influences the intrinsic binding affinity of the implied molecules \n\n for example by artifacts related to the coating on the biosensor of one molecule. Also, an apparent Kd may be measured if one molecule contains more than one recognition sites for the other molecule. In such situation the measured affinity may be affected by the avidity of the interaction by the two molecules. For example, SPR experiments with immobilized human FcRn show a significantly higher affinity (avidity) for human IgG as compared to the affinity of the FcRn interaction with immobilized IgG paralleling the 2: 1 stoichiometry of the FcRn-IgG interaction (Sanchez et al., Biochemistry, 38, 9471-9476, 1999).</p>\n  Another approach that may be used to assess affinity is the 2-step ELISA (Enzyme- Linked Immunosorbent Assay) procedure of Friguet et al. (J. Immunol. Methods, 77, 305-19, 1985). This method establishes a solution phase binding equilibrium measurement and avoids possible artifacts relating to adsorption of one of the molecules on a support such as plastic. For example Nguyen et al (Protein Eng Des SeL, 19, 291-297, 2006) have recently measured the affinity for albumin of Fab constructs using the Friguet assay. However, the accurate measurement of Kd may be quite labor-intensive and as consequence, often apparent Kd values are determined to assess the binding strength of two molecules. It should be noted that as long all measurements are made in a consistent way (e.g. keeping the assay conditions unchanged) apparent Kd measurements can be used as an approximation of the true Kd and hence in the present document Kd and apparent Kd should be treated with equal importance or relevance. Finally, it should be noted that in many situations the experienced scientist may judge it to be convenient to determine the binding affinity relative to some reference molecule. For example, to assess the binding strength between molecules A and B, one may e.g. use a reference molecule C that is known to bind to B and that is suitably labeled with a fluorophore or chromophore group or other chemical moiety, such as biotin for easy detection in an ELISA or FACS (Fluorescent activated cell sorting) or other format (the fluorophore for fluorescence detection, the chromophore for light absorption detection, the biotin for streptavidin-mediated ELISA detection). Typically, the reference molecule C is kept at a fixed concentration and the concentration of B is varied for a given concentration or amount of B. As a result an IC50 value is obtained corresponding to the concentration of A at which the signal measured for C in absence of A is halved. Provided Kd<sub>ref</sub>, the Kd of the reference molecule, is known, as well as the total concentration c<sub>rc</sub>rof the reference molecule, the apparent Kd for the interaction A-B can be obtained from following formula: Kd=IC50/(l+c<sub>ref</sub>/Kd<sub>ref</sub>). Note that if c<sub>ref</sub> \u00ab Kd<sub>ref</sub>, Kd = IC50. Provided one performs the \u03aaC50 \n\n measurement in a consistent way (e.g. keeping c<sub>ref</sub> fixed), the strength or stability of a molecular interaction can be assessed by the IC50 and this measurement is judged as equivalent to Kd or to apparent Kd throughout this text.</p>\n  Preferably, an amino acid sequence of the invention which is in monovalent form (as described herein) will, under the first biological condition, bind to the intended or desired molecule with an affinity (K<sub>D</sub>) better than 3000 nM, preferably better than 300 nM, more preferably better than 30 nM such as better than 3 nM, and will bind to the intended or desired molecule under the second biological condition with an affinity that is at least 10 times worse, preferably more than 100 times worse, such as at least 1000 times worse or more. For example, and without limitation, a monovalent amino acid sequence may bind to the intended or desired molecule under the second biological condition with an affinity worse than 3 nM, more preferably worse than 30 nM, more preferably worse than 300 nM, such as worse than 3000 nM.</p>\n  Besides the affinity of the interaction, also the kinetics of the interaction may be a driving factor in the conditional binding behaviour of the molecule. For example differences in on and off-rates may play a role in influencing the outcome of a binding event, e.g. the speed of detachment from a bound antigen upon changing biological conditions, the rate of binding to the antigen upon changing biological conditions. Preferably, an amino acid sequence of the invention which is in monovalent form (as described herein) will, under the first biological condition, bind to the intended or desired molecule with an off-rate be",
    "iological condition, bind to the intended or desired molecule with karate (i.e. an off-rate) between 0.01 s<sup>\"1</sup> and 10<sup>\"4</sup> s<sup>\"1</sup> and said amino acid sequence of the invention will bind to the intended or desired molecule under the second biological condition with an off- rate that is at least 2 times higher or more than the off-rate under the first biological condition; and wherein said amino acid sequence of the invention binds monovalently to a serum protein (preferably serum albumin) and to a target protein in a monovalent, bivalent or multivalent way.</p>\n  In another embodiment of the invention, an amino acid sequence of the invention which may be in monovalent, bivalent or multivalent form (e.g. as described herein) will, under the first biological condition, bind to the intended or desired molecule with k<sub>off</sub> rate (i.e. an off-rate) between 0.01 s<sup>\"1</sup> and 10<sup>\"4</sup> s<sup>\" 1</sup> and said amino acid sequence of the invention will bind to the intended or desired molecule under the second biological condition with an off- rate that is at least 5 times higher or more than the off -rate under the first biological condition; and wherein said amino acid sequence of the invention binds monovalently to a serum protein (preferably serum albumin) and to a target protein in a monovalent, bivalent or multivalent way. \n\n The binding of an amino acid sequence Io an intended or desired molecule (including the association constant, dissociation constant, affinity, k<sub>on</sub> rate or k<sub>Off</sub> rate of such binding) under the first and second biological condition, respectively, can be determined in any suitable manner known per se, including, for example, Scatchard analysis and/or competitive binding assays, such as radioimmunoassays (RlA), enzyme immunoassays (EIA) and sandwich competition assays, and the different variants thereof known per se in the art. Again, as mentioned above, the binding can be measured in vivo in the human or animal body, or - where this is not feasible or practicable - ex vivo, for example under the conditions of in vitro or cellular assays or models that correspond to and/or are representative for conditions that may occur in the body of an animal or human body. For example, where the first or second biological condition comprises the physiological conditions prevalent in the circulation of a human or animal, the binding of the amino acid sequence of the invention under said condition can be determined in a blood sample, a plasma sample or another suitable blood- or plasma-derived preparation or solution derived from said human or animal. Where the first or second biological condition comprises the physiological conditions prevalent in a cell, the binding of the amino acid sequence of the invention under said condition can be determined in a suitable cellular extract. Where the first or second biological condition differ in pH and/or in ion strength, the binding of th",
    "nst which the present amino acid sequences may be directed are those mentioned in the International application WO 04/003019 (see also EP 1 517 921).</p>\n  According to one specific but non-limiting embodiment, the intended or desired molecule may be any biological molecule that, within the human or animal body in which it is present, is subjected to recycling, internalization, pinocytosis, lranscytosis or endocytosis or otherwise taken up by at least one cell or tissue within the human body. Some non-limiting examples include some serum proteins such as serum albumin and some receptors.</p>\n  According to one specific but non-limiting embodiment, the intended or desired molecule may be any biological molecule that is present on the surface of at least one cell or tissue of a human or animal body. Again, some non-limiting examples include receptors such as the insulin receptor. According to a specific aspect of this embodiment, this biological molecule can also be taken up by the cell on which it is present, for example as part of recycling (e.g. receptor recycling). In other aspects, the invention relates to methods for generating the amino acid sequences of the invention. In one aspect, said method at least comprises the steps of: a) providing a set, collection or library of ammo acid sequences; and b) screening said set, collection or library of amino acid sequences for amino acid sequences that under the first biological condition can bind to said desired molecule with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>\"5</sup> moles/liter or less; c) screening said set, collection or library of amino acid sequences for amino acid sequences that under said second biological condition bind to said desired molecule with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) that is at least 10 fold more than the dissociation constant with which said amino acid sequence binds to said desired molecule under said first biological condition; and d) isolating the amino acid sequence(s) that under the first biological condition can bind to said desired molecule with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>\"5</sup> moles/liter or less and that under said second biological condition bind to said desired molecule with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) that is at least 10 fold more than the dissociation constant with which said amino acid sequence binds to said desired molecule under said first biological condition; In particular, such a method can comprise the steps of: \n\n aj providing a set, collection or library of amino acid sequences; and b) screening said set, collection or library of amino acid sequences for amino acid sequences that under the first biological condition can bind to said desired molecule with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>\"\"</sup> moles/liter or less, so as to provide a set, collection or library of amino acid sequences that under the first biological condition can bind to said desired molecule with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>\"5</sup> moles/liter or less; and c) screening the set, collection or library of amino acid sequences obtained in step b) for amino acid sequences that under said second biological condition bind to said desired molecule with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) that is at least 10 foJd more than the dissociation constant with which said amino acid sequence binds to said desired molecule under said first biological condition; and d) isolating the amino acid sequence(s) that under the first biological condition can bind to said desired molecule with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>\"5</sup> moles/liter or less and that under said second biological condition bind to said desired molecule with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) that is at least 10 fold more than the dissociation constant with which said amino acid sequence binds to said desired molecule under said first biological condition.</p>\n  Generally, in these methods, the step b) of screening the set, collection or library of amino acid sequences for amino acid sequences that under the first biological condition can bind to said desired molecule with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>\"5</sup> moles/liter or less is performed by screening under the first biological condition.</p>\n  Similarly, in these methods, the step c) of screening the set, collection or library of amino acid sequences for amino acid sequences that under said second biological condition bind to said desired molecule with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) that is at least 10 fold more than the dissociation constant with which said amino acid sequence binds to said desired molecule under said first biological condition; is performed under the second biological condition.</p>\n  In other aspects, the invention relates to methods for generating the amino acid sequences of the invention. In one aspect, said method at least comprises the steps of: a) providing a set, collection or library of amino acid sequences; and \n\n b) screening said set, collection or library of amino acid sequences for amino acid sequences that under the first biological condition can bind to said desired molecule with a k<sub>Off</sub> rate of 0. 1 s<sup>\"1</sup> and 10<sup>~6</sup> s<sup>\"1</sup>, e.g. such a k<sub>Off</sub>as 0.01 to 0.00001 ; and c) screening said set, collection or library of amino acid sequences for amino acid sequences that under said second biological condition bind to said desired molecule with a k<sub>Off</sub> rate that is at least 1.5 times or more than the k<sub>Off</sub> rate with which said amino acid sequence binds to said desired molecule under said first biological condition, more preferably the k<sub>O</sub>ff rate is 1.7 times or more, more preferably the k<sub>Off</sub> rate is 2 times or more, more preferably the k<sub>Off</sub> rate is 3 times or more, more preferably the k<sub>Off</sub> rate is 4 times or more, more preferably the k<sub>off</sub> rate is 5 times or more, more preferably the k<sub>Off</sub> rate is 10 times or more; and d) isolating said amin",
    "up>\"1</sup> and 10<sup>\"6</sup> s \\ e.g. such a k<sub>off</sub> as 0.01 to 0.00001; and c) (screening said set, collection or library of amino acid sequences for amino acid sequences that under said first biological condition, e.g. a pH between 7.2 and 7.4, e.g. pH 7.3, bind to said desired molecule with a k<sub>\u03cbff</sub> rate that is at least 2 times or more such as 3 times, 5 times, 10 times, 100 times, 1000 times than the k<sub>off</sub> rate with which said amino acid sequence binds to said desired molecule under said second biological condition; or d) screening said set, collection or library of amino acid sequences for amino acid sequences that under said first biological condition does not bind to said desired molecule), and e) isolating said amino acid sequence(s) ; and optionally f) evaluate in vivo (e.g. PK evaluation in Cynomolgus monkey) the half life of said amino acid sequences.</p>\n  As will be clear to the skilled person, the screening step can also be performed as a selection step. For example, antibody-antigen interactions are known to be often sensitive to changes in buffer conditions, pH and ionic strength, but most often those changes are not scored or investigated, and they are not often used to design drug therapeutics as variations are overall unpredictable. Binding proteins with the desirable binding characteristics are found for example by screening repertoires of binding proteins for the occurrence of a sensitive interaction, e.g. by carrying out a binding assay with under the first and second biological condition, respectively, and the relative binding strength determined. Such strength of relative interaction can be measured with any suitable binding test including ELISA, BIAcore -based methods, Scatchard analysis etc. Such test will reveal which binding proteins display interactions that are sensitive to the chosen parameter (pH) and to what extent. Binding proteins with the desirable binding characteristics are alternatively found by selecting repertoires of binding proteins, e.g. from phage, ribosome, yeast or cellular libraries using conditions in the selection that will preferentially enrich for the desirable sensitivity. Taking a first and second biological condition that differ in respect of pH as an example, incubating a phage antibody library at basic pH (e.g. pH 7.4) and eluting the bound phage particles with a buffer of lower pH (e.g. 6.0) will enrich for those phage antibodies that are recognizing antigen sensitive to this pH change. A repetitive cycle of such selections is then \n\n followed by screening of individual clones to identify the binding protein that displays pH- dependent binding in this pH window. Binding proteins with the desirable binding characteristics can further be isolated from designer protein libraries in which the putative binding site has been engineered to contain amino acid residues or sequences that are preferred in certain 'sensitive' interactions, e.g. histidines for pH-sensitivity. For example, it is known that the interaction between FcRn and IgG is exquisitely sensitive to pH, being reduced over 2 orders of magnitude as the pH is raised from pH 6.0 to 7.0. The main mechanistic basis of the affinity transition is the histidine content of the binding site : the imidazole side changes of histidine residues usually deprotonate over the pH range 6.0-7.0. The explicit inclusion of histidines in the putative binding site (e.g. using oligonucleotides that preferentially introduce this residue in the library, as with the use of trinucleotides and known in the field, e.g. Knappik et al, J. MoI. Biol 2000, vol 296:57-86) is predicted to yield a higher frequency of amino acid sequences that bind essentially dependent of the pH.</p>\n  Accordingly the term \"screening\" as used in the present description can comprise selection, screening or any suitable combination of selection and/or screening techniques.</p>\n  In general, steps b) and c) can be performed as single or separate screening steps, or as part of a single screening process. When steps b) and c) are performed as part of a single screening process, such a screening process may for example comprise the steps of: i) bringing the set, collection or library of amino acid sequences in contact with the desired molecule under the first biological condition (i.e. such that amino acid sequences that can bind to said desired molecule with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>\"5</sup> moles/liter or less bind to the desired molecule, and such that amino acid sequences that can not bind to said desired molecule with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10\u00b0 moles/liter or less do not bind to the desired molecule); ii) removing the amino acid sequence that do not bind in step i) (i.e. those amino acid sequences that under the first biological condition do not bind to said desired molecule with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>\"5</sup> moles/liter or less); so that a set or collection of amino acid sequences remains that is bound to the intended to desired molecule (and that is still present under the first biological condition); iii) subjecting the set or collection of amino acid sequences to the second biological condition, such that amino acid sequences that do not conditionally bind (as defined herein) to the intended or desired molecule stay bound to the intended or desired molecule, and such that amino acid sequences that conditionally bind (as defined \n\n herein) to the intended or desired molecule no longer stay bound Io the intended or desired molecule; iv) separating the amino acid sequences that conditionally bind (as defined herein) to the intended or desired molecule from the amino acid sequences that do not conditionally bind (that are still bound to the desired molecule); and optionally v) collecting the amino acid sequences that conditionally bind to the intended or desired molecule.</p>\n  For example, this single screening process can easily be performed by providing a suitable carrier or support (such as a column, beads, or solid surface such as the surface of a well of a multi-well plate, or the stationary phase of a Biacore) onto which the desired molecule is suitably immobilized (for example covalently or via an avidin-steptavidin linkage); contacting the carrier or support with the set, collection or library of amino acid sequence",
    "sent in the compound of the invention. Such purposes and amino acid sequences and compounds of the invention suitable for such applications will be clear to the skilled person based on the disclosure herein.</p>\n  According to one specific, but non-limiting application of the invention, the amino acid sequences of the invention are directed against a serum protein, and can be used as a fusion partner, binding unit or moiety for increasing the half-life of a therapeutic moiety or compound (as described herein). Amino acid sequences that are capable of binding to serum proteins and uses thereof in polypeptide constructs in order to increase the half-life of therapeutically relevant proteins, polypeptides and other compounds are known in the art.</p>\n  For example, WO 91/01743, WO 01/45746 and WO 02/076489 describe peptide moieties binding to serum albumin that can be fused to therapeutic proteins and other therapeutic compounds and entities in order to increase the half-life thereof. However, these peptide moieties are of bacterial or synthetic origin, which is less preferred for use in therapeutics.</p>\n  The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), also termed \"Brambell receptor\", is involved in prolonging the life-span of albumin in circulation (see Chaudhury et al., The Journal of Experimental Medicine, vol. 3, no. 197, 315-322 (2003)). The FcRn receptor is an integral membrane glycoprotein consisting of a soluble light chain consisting of \u03b22-microglobulin, noncovalently bound to a 43 kD \u03b1 chain with three extracellular domains, a transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic tail of about 50 amino acids. The cytoplasmic tail contains a dinucleotide motif-based endocytosis signal implicated in the internalization of the receptor. The \u03b1 chain is a member of the nonclassical MHC 1 family of proteins. The \u03b22m association with the \u03b1 chain is critical for correct folding of FcRn and exiting the endoplasmic reticulum for routing to endosomes and the cell surface.</p>\n  The overall structure of FcRn is similar to that of class I molecules. The \u03b1-1 and \u03b8\u03cb-2 regions resemble a platform composed of eight antiparallel \u03b2 strands forming a single \u03b2-sheet topped by two antiparallel \u03b1-helices very closely resembling the peptide cleft in MHC I molecules. Owing to an overall repositioning of the \u03b1-1 helix and bending of the C-terminal portion of the \u03b1-2 helix due to a break in the helix introduced by the presence of Pro 162, the \n\n FcRn helices are considerably closer together, occluding peptide binding. The side chain of Argl64 of FcRn also occludes the potential interaction of the peptide N-terminus with the MHC pocket. Further, salt bridge and hydrophobic interaction between the \u03b1-1 and \u03b1-2 helices may also contribute to the groove closure. FcRn therefore, does not participate in antigen presentation, and the peptide cleft is empty.</p>\n  FcRn binds and transports IgG across the placental syncytiotrophoblast from maternal circulation to fetal circulation and protects IgG from ",

It is known that these Nanobodies\u00ae are more potent and more stable than conventional four-chain serum albumin binding antibodies which leads to (1 ) lower dosage forms, less frequent dosage leading to less side effects; (2) improved stability leading to a broader choice of administration routes, comprising oral or subcutaneous routes in addition to the intravenous route; (3) lower treatment cost due to lower cost of goods.</p>\n  In this embodiment of the invention, the desired molecule is a serum protein, and in particular a serum protein that is subjected to recycling within the human or animal body. \n\n Some non-limiting examples of such serum proteins are serum proteins that can bind to FcRn such as serum albumin and IgG. Other serum proteins to which the amino acid sequences of the invention can bind will be clear to the skilled person, and for example include the serum proteins mentioned in the International application WO 04/003019 (see also EP 1 517 921). Thus, according to this embodiment, the invention relates to an amino acid sequence that is directed against a serum protein, wherein said amino acid sequence: a) binds to said serum protein under a first biological condition with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>\"5</sup> moles/liter or less and/or with a binding affinity (K<sub>A</sub>) of at least</p>\n  10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>\"!</sup>; and b) binds to said serum protein under a second biological condition with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) that is at least 10 fold more than the dissociation constant with which said amino acid sequence binds to said serum protein under said first biological condition.</p>\n  The serum protein to which the amino acid sequences of the invention bind (or under physiological conditions can bind) may be any serum protein (such as those mentioned herein and in WO 04/003019, and may in particular be any serum protein that is subject to recycling or a recycling mechanism in the human or animal body in which said serum protein naturally occurs. Examples of such serum proteins will be clear to the skilled person.</p>\n  More in particular, the serum protein to which the amino acid sequences of the invention bind (or under physiological conditions can bind) may be chosen from the group consisting of: serum albumin, immunoglobulins such as IgG and transferrin. According to a preferred, but non-limiting embodiment, the amino acid sequences of the invention bind to serum albumin.</p>\n  The serum protein is preferably a human serum protein, such as human serum albumin, IgG or transferrin, and in particular human serum albumin. However, it should be understood that according to some specific but non-limiting aspects of the invention, the amino acid sequences of the invention may be cross-reactive with the corresponding (i.e. orthologous) serum protein from at least another species of mammal, such as mouse, rat, rabbit, dog or primate. In particular, according to these aspects, the amino acid sequences of the invention may be cross-reactive with the corresponding (i.e. orthologous) serum protein from at least another species of primate, as further described herein.</p>\n  In particular, according to this embodiment, the amino acid sequence of the invention may bind to said serum protein under said second biological condition with a dissociation \n\n constant (K<sub>D</sub>) that is at least 10-fold more, preferably 100 fold more, more preferably 1000 fold more, than the dissociation constant with which said amino acid sequence binds to said serum protein under said first biological condition. In a preferred embodiment, the amino acid sequence of the invention, e.g. a single chain antibody, e.g. a dAb or a Nanobody, does not bind at all under said second biological condition, e.g. the amino acid sequence of the invention does not bind at pH5.5 (or at a pH between 5 to 6) but binds at physiological pH, i.e. pH 7.2 to 7.4.</p>\n  Preferably, according to this embodiment, the amino acid sequence of the invention binds to said serum protein under said first biological condition with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>\"</sup> moles/liter or less, preferably with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>'</sup> moles/liter or less, more preferably with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>\"</sup> moles/liter or less.</p>\n  Also, preferably, according to this embodiment, the amino acid sequence of the invention binds to said serum protein under said second biological condition with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>\"6</sup> moles/liter or more, preferably with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>\"5</sup> moles/liter or more, more preferably with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>\"4</sup> moles/liter or more.</p>\n  In another embodiment of this invention, the amino acid sequence of the invention binds to said serum protein under said second biological condition with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) that is at least 10-fold less, 100 fold less, preferably 1000 fold less, than the dissociation constant with which said amino acid sequence binds to said serum protein under said first biological condition.</p>\n  In another embodiment of this invention, the amino acid sequence of the invention binds to said serum protein under said first biological condition with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>\"6</sup> moles/liter or more, and under said second biological condition with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>'7</sup> moles/liter or less, e.g. 10<sup>\"s</sup> moles/liter or less or 10<sup>'9</sup> moles/liter or less.</p>\n  In another embodiment of this invention, the amino acid sequence of the invention binds to said serum protein under said first biological condition with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>\"5</sup> moles/liter or more, and under said second biological condition with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 3O<sup>\"6</sup> moles/liter or less, e.g. 10<sup>\"7</sup> moles/liter or less; or e.g. 10<sup>\"8</sup> moles/liter or less.</p>\n  In another embodiment of this invention, the amino acid sequence of the invention binds to said serum protein under said first biological condition with a dissociation constant \n\n (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>'4</sup> moles/liter or more, and under said second biological condition with a dissociation constant (Ko) of 10\u00b0 moles/liter or less, e.g. 10<sup>6</sup> moles/liter or less; or e.g. 10<sup>\"7</sup> moles/liter or less.</p>\n  In a preferred embodiment, the amino acid sequence of the invention, e.g. a single chain antibody, e.g. a dAb or a Nanobody, does not bind at all under said first biological condition, e.g. the amino acid sequence of the invention binds al endosomal pH5.5 (or at a pH between 5 to 6) but does not bind at extracellular pH, i.e. at pH 7.2 to 7.4.</p>\n  In a further preferred embodiment, the amino acid sequence of the invention, e.g. a single chain antibody, e.g. a dAb or a Nanobody, is a bivalent or multivalent amino acid sequence, wherein one binding block is directed against human serum albumin and wherein said human serum albumin binding block does not bind at pH 5.5 (or at a pH between 5 to 6) but binds at pH 7.2 to 7.4; and optionally the amino acid sequence of the invention, e.g. a single chain antibody, e.g. a dAb or a Nanobody, is binding to a target protein for therapeutic intervention (e.g. in a monovalent or multivalent, e.g. bivalent format). An example of such targets for therapeutic intervention are proteins of the TNF superfamily (Aggarwal, Nature Reviews Immunology 3: 747, 2003). This superfamily of proteins consists of 19 members that signal through 29 receptors. These ligands, while regulating normal functions such as immune responses, haematopoiesis and morphogenesis, have also been implicated in tumorgenesis, trans",

For example, in this embodiment, the amino acid sequences of the invention may bind to or otherwise associate with human serum proteins such as serum albumin in such a way that, when the amino acid sequences are bound to or otherwise associated with a human serum protein such as serum albumin, the amino acid sequences exhibit a serum half-life in human of at least about 50% (such as about 50% to</p>\n  70%), preferably at least 60% (such as about 60% to 80%) or preferably at least 70% (such as about 70% to 90%), more preferably at. least about 80% (such as about 80% to 90%) or preferably at least about 90% of the natural half-life of said serum protein (such as human serum albumin). Also, preferably, in this embodiment, the amino acid sequences of the invention bind to said serum protein (such as human serum albumin) with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) and/or with a binding affinity (K<sub>A</sub>) that is as defined herein. In man, the half- life of serum albumin is about 19 days (Peters T (1996) All About Albumin. Academic Press, San Diego).</p>\n  This in vivo half- life in primates makes the amino acid sequences of the invention ideal candidates to prolong the serum half-life of therapeutics attached thereto. A long serum half-life of the combined amino acid sequence and therapeutics according to the invention in turn allows for reduced frequencies of administration and/or reduced amount to be administered, bringing about significant benefits for the subject to be treated.</p>\n  This embodiment therefore also comprises compounds of the invention that comprise such an amino acid sequence and that have a half-life in human that is at least 80%, more preferably at least 90%, such as 95% or more or essentially the same as the half-life in human of the amino acid sequence present in said compound. \n\n In one specific aspect of this embodiment, the amino acid sequences of the invention may be such thai they are cross-reactive with the corresponding (i.e. orthologo\u03c5s) scrum protein (such as serum albumin) from at least one further species of primate, and in particular with the corresponding (i.e. orthologous) serum protein from at least one species of primate that is chosen from the group consisting of monkeys from the genus Macaca (such as, and in particular, cynomologus monkeys {Macaca fascicularis) and/or rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatto)) and baboon (Papio ursinus). Preferably, such cross-reactive amino acid sequences are further such that they exhibit a serum half-life in said primate of at least about 50% (such as about 50% to 70%), preferably at least 60% (such as about 60% to 80%) or preferably at least 70% (such as about 70% to 90%), more preferably at least about 80% (such as about 80% to 90%) or preferably at least about 90% of the natural half-life of the corresponding (i.e. orthologous) serum protein (such as serum albumin) in said primate. Such amino acid sequences of the invention also preferably bind to the corresponding (i.e. orthologous) serum protein (such as serum albumin) from said primate with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) and/or with a binding affinity (K<sub>A</sub>) that is as defined herein.</p>\n  This embodiment therefore also comprises compounds of the invention that comprise at least one amino acid sequence of the invention and that have a half-life in human and/or in said at least one species of primate that is at least 80%, more preferably at least 90%, such as 95% or more or essentially the same as the half-life in human and/or said species of primate, respectively, of the amino acid sequence of the invention present in said compound.</p>\n  According to another preferred, but non-limiting aspect of this embodiment of the invention, the amino acid sequences of the invention are such that they bind to or otherwise associate with a human serum protein (such as human serum albumin) in such a way that, when the amino acid sequences are bound to or otherwise associated with said serum protein, the amino acid sequences exhibit a serum half-life in human of at least about 9 days (such as about 9 to 14 days), preferably at least about 10 days (such as about 10 to 15 days) or at least</p>\n  11 days (such as about 11 to 16 days), more preferably at least about 12 days (such as about</p>\n  12 to 18 days or more) or more than 14 days (such as about 14 to 19 days). Such amino acid sequences of the invention preferably can bind to said human serum protein (such as human serum albumin) with a dissociation constant (Kn) and/or with a binding affinity (K<sub>A</sub>) that is as defined herein.</p>\n  This embodiment therefore also comprises compounds of the invention that comprise such an amino acid sequence and that have a half-life in human that is at least 80%, more \n\n preferably at least 90%, such as 95% or more or essentially the same as the half-life in human of the amino acid sequence present in said compound.</p>\n  In one specific but non-limiting aspect of this embodiment, the amino acid sequences of the invention may be such that they are cross-reactive with the corresponding (i.e. orthologous) serum protein (such as serum albumin) from at least one further species of primate, and in particular with the corresponding (i.e. orthologous) serum protein (such as serum albumin) from at least one species of primate that is chosen from the group consisting of monkeys from the genus Macaca (such as rhesus monkeys or cynomologus monkeys) and baboons. Preferably, such cross-reactive amino acid sequences exhibit a serum half-life in said primate of at least about 50% (such as about 50% to 70%), preferably at least 60% (such as about 60% to 80%) or preferably at least 70 % (such as about 70% to 90%), more preferably at least about 80% (such as about 80% to 90%) or preferably at least about 90% of the natural half-life of the corresponding (i.e. orthologous) serum protein (such as serum albumin) in said primate.

This embodiment therefore also comprises compounds of the invention that comprise such an amino acid sequence and that have a half-life in human and/or in said at least one species of primate that is at least 80%, more preferably at least 90%, such as 95% or more or essentially the same as the half-life in human and/or said species of primate, respectively, of the amino acid sequence present in said compound.</p>\n  In another specific, but non-limiting aspect of this embodiment, the amino acid sequences of the invention may be such that they bind to or otherwise associate with the corresponding (i.e. orthologous) serum protein (such as serum albumin) from at least one species of primate and that, when the half-life of the corresponding (i.e. orthologous) serum protein in the primate is at least about J 0 days, such as between 10 and 15 days, for example about 1 1 to 13 days (by means of example, in rhesus monkeys, the expected half-life of serum albumin is between about 1 1 and 13 days, in particular about 1 1 to 12 days), have a serum half-life in said primate of least about 5 days (such as about 5 to 9 days), preferably at least about 6 days (such as about 6 to 10 days) or at least 7 days (such as about 7 to 11 days), more preferably at least about 8 days (such as about 8 to 12 days) or more than 9 days (such about 9 to 12 days or more).

Som",
    "s are further such that they can bind to or otherwise associate with the serum protein {such as serum albumin) in such a way that, when the amino acid sequence or polypeptide construct is bound to or otherwise associated with the serum protein molecule, the binding of said serum protein molecule to FcRn is not (significantly) reduced or inhibited (i.e. compared to the binding of said serum protein molecule to FcRn when the amino acid sequence or polypeptide construct is not bound thereto). In this aspect of this embodiment, by \"not significantly reduced or inhibited\" is meant that the binding affinity for serum protein to FcRn (as measured using a suitable assay, such as SPR) is not reduced by more than 50%, preferably not reduced by more than 30 %, even more preferably not reduced by more than 10%, such as not reduced by more than 5%, or essentially not reduced at all. In this aspect of this embodiment, \"not significantly reduced or inhibited\" may also mean (or additionally mean) that the half-life of the serum protein molecule is not significantly reduced (as defined below). When in this description, reference is made to binding, such binding is preferably specific binding, as normally understood by the skilled person.</p>\n  When an amino acid sequence as described herein is a monovalent immunoglobulin sequence (for example, a monovalent Nanobody), said monovalent immunoglobulin \n\n sequence preferably binds to human serum albumin under the first biological condition with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>'5</sup> to 10<sup>\"!2</sup> moles/liter or less, and preferably 10<sup>\"7</sup> to 1(X<sup>12</sup> moles/liter or less and more preferably I0<sup>\"8</sup> to 10<sup>\"!2</sup> moles/liter (i.e. with an association constant (K<sub>A</sub>) of 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>12</sup> liter/ moles or more, and preferably 10<sup>7</sup> to 10<sup>12</sup> liter/moles or more and more preferably 10<sup>8</sup> to 10<sup>12</sup> liter/moles, and/or with a binding affinity (K<sub>A</sub>) of at least 10<sup>7</sup> M<sup>\"1</sup>, preferably at least 10<sup>8</sup> M<sup>\"1</sup>, more preferably at least 10<sup>9</sup> M<sup>\"1</sup>, such as at least 10<sup>12</sup> M<sup>\"1</sup>. Any K<sub>D</sub> value greater than 10<sup>4</sup> mol/liter (or any K<sub>A</sub> value lower than 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>\"1</sup>) liters/mol is generally considered to indicate non-specific binding. Preferably, a monovalent immunoglobulin sequence of this embodiment will bind to the desired serum protein under the first biological condition with an affinity less than 3000 nM, preferably less than 300 nM, more preferably less than 30 nM, such as less than 3 nM. Specific binding of an antigen- binding protein to an antigen or antigenic determinant can be determined in any suitable manner known per se, including, for example, Scatchard analysis and/or competitive binding assays, such as radioimmunoassays (RIA), enzyme immunoassays (EIA) and sandwich competition ",
    "g advantage of the differences in pH between the cell- surface and intracellular vesicles to regulate the process (Melmann, ref 61 in Sprague et al). In another aspect of the invention, an antigen-reactive (first) binding protein is itself linked to another (second) binding protein that recognizes a serum protein that is known to recognize the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) or salvage receptor. Alternatively, equally preferred, the antigen-reactive binding protein contains a second binding site, distinct from the antigen binding site, that recognizes a serum protein that is known to recognize FcRn or salvage receptor. Of peculiar importance is albumin, present at 41.8mg/ml in human plasma (Davies and Morris, 1993), which in the course of endosomal recycling (Kim et al., 2006) is known to bind to FcRn at a site which is distinct from the site that is employed for IgG binding. Another equally important serum protein is IgG, abundantly present (11-12/mg/ml) in human serum (Waldmann and Strober).</p>\n  If the antigen-reactive protein binds to the serum protein at the site that is recognized by FcRn, the antigen-binding protein complex becomes rapidly degraded upon endosomal uptake as the serum protein has lost it potential to be rescued by FcRn.</p>\n  According to the present invention, the difference in binding strength of a binding protein towards albumin between conditions prevailing in plasma as compared to these of the endosomal compartment can rationalize the relation between Kd and tl/2. Albumin is present in plasma at very high concentration in all animals (32.7, 31.6, 38.7, 49.3, 26.3, 41.8 mg/ml in respectively mouse, rat, rabbit, monkey, dog and human as tabulated by Davis and Morris, 1993). Chaudhury et al. (2003) and Kim et al. (2006) have shown that albumin is constitutively endocytosed and rescued from degradation through acid dependent high affinity binding to FcRn (histocompatibility complex-related Fc receptor). FcRn recycles also IgG which is to enter the endocytic route via fluid phase pinocytosis or by receptor-mediated uptake (Ober et al., 2004). Interestingly, albumin binds to FcRn with a 1:1 stoichiometry (Chaudhury et al., 2006) in contrast to FcRn - IgG complexes which under equilibrium conditions have a 2: 1 stoichiometry (Sanchez et al, 1999) although an apparent 1 :1 \n\n stoichiometry as described in mouse (Popov et al., 1996) but this has been show to be related to alterations of carbohydrate moieties on mouse and may be related to non -equilibrium measurements (Sanchez et al, 1999) . From the analysis of w.t, and FcRn-deficient mice, the turnover rate of albumin has been analysed in detail (Kim et al., 2006). The albumin recycling rate is very high. More precisely, the albumin recycling rate equals 31 ,000 nmol/day/kg with a steady state albumin production and catabolism rate of 31,000 nmol/day/kg.</p>\n  During endosomal processing, a albumin or IgG, is bound FcRn under the acidic conditions of the endosome and follows the route of sorting endosomes to exocytosis as described in detail for IgG salvage(Ober et al., 2004). It should be noted that albumin and IgG bind to a different site in FcRn (Kim et al, 2006). The affinity for albumin to FcRn is about 200 times higher at acidic pH as compared to neutral pH in agreement with the proposed role of FcRn as a protecting receptor preventing FcRn bound albumin to enter the lysosomal degradation pathway. The Kd at pH6 of human albumin for human FcRn is 1.8 to 3 microM (Chaudhury et al., 2006). An increased binding of IgG to FcRn between pH 6 and neutral pH is also seen for IgG. The Kd at pH6 for a wild type IgGl and human FcRn was found to be 2527nM (DaIF Acqua et al., 2002). It should be noted that although FcRn binds albumin or IgG with similar affinity at acidic pH, the difference in stoichiometry between albumin-FcRn as compared to IgG-FcRn may perhaps result in an enhanced protection of IgG by FcRn in the endosomal compartment.</p>\n  After a conditional amino acid sequence bound to a serum protein (such as a Nanobody bound to albumin or IgG) enters the endosomal compartment, it is subjected to the acidic pH (near pH 6) of the endosome, which leads to a decrease of affinity of the conditional amino acid sequence for albumin. In addition, a (further) reduction in binding to albumin may be accompanied by an increase in protease susceptibility.</p>\n  Although the invention is not limited to a specific mechanism or explanation, it is expected that the Kd will be affected by pH if titratable moieties are involved in stabilizing the interaction with albumin or if the acidic pH induces conformational adjustments affecting Kd. According to the invention, this profoundly increases the 11/2 of the amino acid sequence of the invention (or a compound comprising the same).</p>\n  Thus, according to one non-limiting aspect of the invention, a prolonged half life of an albumin binding conditional binder of the invention (or of a compound comprising the same) is obtained by either increasing its binding strength for albumin at serum pH (7.2-7.4) \n\n such under less favourable endosomal conditions the residua] apparent Kd is such that only a limited fraction of the binding molecules is dissociated from albumin; and/or not increasing its binding strength for albumin at serum pH but enhancing the binding strength under endosomal conditions. Again, according to the invention, this teaching is not restricted to albumin but can be applied also to molecules binding to other serum proteins, such as IgG. This particular aspect of the invention is depicted schematically in the non-iimiting Figure 1. It is well known that the interaction of various serum protein that bind to the FcRn is known to be pH sensitive (interaction 1 in Figure 1). As a consequence the complex between the composite binding protein, the antigen and the serum protein, after pinocytosis and drop in pH can bind via the serum protein to the FcRn and its components are salvaged from degradation (Figure 2).</p>\n  The conditional binders of the invention are equally sensitive to the changes in conditions upon internalization, and as such influence the half-life of the bound antigen. As some specific non-limiting examples of this aspect of the invention, the interactions of this composite binding protein, antigen or serum protein (interactions 3 and 2, respectively in Figure 1), may or may not be 'sensitive' towards changes in the conditions upon internalization. This are also summarized in Tables 1, 2 and 3, by means of representative but non-limiting examples in which the conditional binders no interaction at pH 6 and 100% interacti",
    "t due to the rescue by a composite binding protein. In these aspects and examples of the invention, binding of the Amino acid sequence or compound of the invention itself may be sufficient by itself to induce a biased clearance of the antigen, but preferably the complex of the amino acid sequence or compound of the invention and the antigen is actively targeted to the endosomal compartment, e.g. by another Amino acid sequence or compound of the invention that recognizes a cell -surface target (preferably FcRn) that is regularly internalized and cleared via the endosomal compartment, or via recognition of a factor present in circulation that is cycled via the endosomal compartment. Preferred is that this cell-surface target is FcRn, or that the serum protein is IgG or albumin, or transferrin.</p>\n  This invention in a further aspect encompasses methods to generate binding proteins to antigens and/or serum proteins that are sensitive in their interaction, e.g. to the changing environment upon internalization. Antibody-antigen interactions are known to be sometimes sensitive to changes in buffer conditions, pH and ionic strength, but most often those changes are not scored or investigated, and they are not often used to design drug therapeutics as variations are overall unpredictable. Binding proteins with the desirable binding characteristics are found for example by screening repertoires of binding proteins for the occurrence of a sensitive interaction, e.g. by carrying out a binding assay with two representative conditions (e.g. at pH 7.4 and at pH 6.0), and the relative binding strength determined. Such strength of relative interaction can be measured with any suitable binding test including ELISA, BIAcore-based methods, Scatchard analysis etc. Such test will reveal which binding proteins display interactions that are sensitive to the chosen parameter (pH, ionic strength, temperature) and to what extend. Conditional binders of the invention may alternatively be generated by selecting repertoires of binding proteins, e.g. from phage, ribosome, yeast or cellular libraries using conditions in the selection that will preferentially enrich for the desirable sensitivity. Incubating a phage antibody library at physiological pH and eluting the bound phage particles by only changing the pH to 6.0 for example will elute those phages with a pH-sensitive interaction. Similarly a change in ionic strength can be employed (e.g. from 150 mM to 1.0 mM NaCl or KCl) to identify interactions highly sensitive to these interactions. Equally \n\n important are conditions that are sensitive to the concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> . For example, Christensen et at, (2001), have observed reductions in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]pino by two orders of magnitude as pH decreases from 7.2 to 6.2 in newly formed pinosomes, followed by significant increases in [Ca\"<sup>+</sup>]pino as the pinosome matures, implying that low calcium concentration is a distinct physiological feature of early "
