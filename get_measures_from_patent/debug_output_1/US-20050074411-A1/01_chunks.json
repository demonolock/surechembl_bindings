Note that as used herein, bb(CO)DTPA-Gd means a C\u2550O moiety bound to an ethylene backbone carbon atom of DTPA. </p> The terms \u201cchelating ligand,\u201d \u201cchelating moiety,\u201d and \u201cchelate moiety\u201d may be used to refer to any polydentate ligand which is capable of coordinating a metal ion, including DTPA (and DTPE), DOTA, DO3A, or NOTA molecule, or any other suitable polydentate chelating ligand as is further defined herein, that is either coordinating a metal ion or is capable of doing so, either directly or after removal of protecting groups, or is a reagent, with or without suitable protecting groups, that is used in the synthesis of a contrast agent and comprises substantially all of the atoms that ultimately will coordinate the metal ion of the final metal complex. The term \u201cchelate\u201d refers to the actual metal-ligand complex, and it is understood that the polydentate ligand will eventually be coordinated to a medically useful metal ion. </p> The term \u201cspecific binding affinity\u201d as used herein, refers to the capacity of a contrast agent to be taken up by, retained by, or bound to a particular biological component to a greater degree than other components. Contrast agents that have this property are said to be \u201ctargeted\u201d to the \u201ctarget\u201d component. Contrast agents that lack this property are said to be \u201cnon-specific\u201d or \u201cnon-targeted\u201d agents.

These chelating moieties contain a synthetic moiety capable of forming a point of attachment to the linker, linker-subunit, and/or modified peptide. One or more chelating moieties may be covalently conjugated to the functional group at each terminus of the modified peptide. In one embodiment, the chelate is attached to a linker-subunit.

    "attached to the N-terminus, or a peptide with one or more chelates attached to the C-terminus. To estimate in vivo stability, test compounds can be incubated with rat liver homogenates. After selected intervals, the reactions can be quenched and centrifuged, and the supernatant can be analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to quantitate the amount of compound remaining. </p> Compounds of the invention also can bind a target such as human serum albumin or fibrin. For example, at least 10% (e.g., at least 50%, 80%, 90%, 92%, 94%, or 96%) of the contrast agent can be bound to the desired target at physiologically relevant concentrations of drug and target. The extent of binding of a contrast agent to a target, such as HSA or fibrin, can be assessed by a variety of equilibrium binding methods. For example, binding to HSA can be measured by ultrafiltration. For measuring binding to fibrin, a fibrin clot may be formed in a well of a microtiter plate and contacted with the targeting group. After an incubation time sufficient to establish equilibrium, the supernatant is removed by aspiration (the insoluble fibrin remains bound as a gelled clot to the bottom of the well). The concentration of unbound targeting group in the supernatant is then measured. In both methodologies, the concentration of bound contrast agent is determined as the difference between the total targeting group concentration initially present and the unbound targeting group concentration following the binding assay. The bound fraction is the concentration of bound targeting group divided by the concentration of total targeting group. </p> Compounds of the invention can exhibit high relaxivity as a result of target binding (e.g., to fibrin), which can lead to better image resolution. The increase in relaxivity upon binding is typically 1.5-fold or more (e.g., at least a 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 fold increase in relaxivity). Targeted contrast agents having 7-8 fold, 9-10 fold, or even greater than 10 fold increases in relaxivity are particularly useful. Typically, relaxivity is measured using an NMR spectrometer. The preferred relaxivity of an MRI contrast agent at 20 MHz and 37\u00b0 C. is at least 10 mM\u22121s\u22121 per paramagnetic metal ion (e.g., at least 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, or 60 mM\u22121s\u22121 per paramagnetic metal ion. Contrast agents having a relaxivity greater than 60 mM\u22121s\u22121 at 20 MHz and 37\u00b0 C. are particularly useful. </p> As described herein, targeted contrast agents can show an increase in clot uptake. Specificity of uptake of fibrin-targeted agents can be determined by comparing the uptake of the agent by blood clots to the uptake by blood. See Example 11 for more details. The specificity of fibrin-targeted contrast agents also can be demonstrated using MRI and observing enhancement of clot signal. </p> Use of Peptides and Contrast Agents of the Invention </p> Peptides of the invention can be used to improve therapies for treating thromboembolic disease.

    "The extent of binding of a contrast agent according to the present invention to a target, such as HSA or fibrin, can be assessed by a variety of equilibrium binding methods. For example, binding to HSA can be measured by ultrafiltration. In a typical binding measurement using ultrafiltration, the contrast agent is mixed with 4.5% weight/volume HSA in a pH 7.4 buffer. The sample is loaded into a commercially available centrifugation apparatus equipped with a 30 kDa molecular weight cutoff filter (Millipore Ultrafree MC Low Binding Regenerated Cellulose 30 KDa mol. wt. cutoff catalog # UFC3LTK00), permeable to the targeting group, but not to HSA. A small portion (5-10%) of the sample volume is filtered by centrifugation at 2000\u00d7g for 20 min through the cutoff filter, and the concentration of unbound targeting group in the sample is measured in the filtrate. </p> For measuring binding to fibrin, a fibrin clot may be formed in a well of a microtiter plate and contacted with the targeting group.

For example, when comparing fluorescein, 4-methoxycoumarin and tetramethylrhodamine derivatives of the peptide (QWECPYGLCWIQ (SEQ ID NO:27); Kd=3 \u03bcM) the following Kd's were observed (Table 6):  \nTABLE 6CompoundFluorophoreKdJFluorescein0.06LTetramethylrhodamine2.0N4-Methoxycoumarin0.2\n</p>Example 14 Fibrin Targeted Urokinase:  Fibrin targeted urokinase is prepared according to the following procedure. A fibrin binding peptide with a Gly-Gly dipeptide linker is prepared according to solid phase procedures. The N-terminus of the peptide is blocked with an acetyl group, and the C-terminal carboxylic acid is converted to a succinamidal active ester. Direct chemical ligation is achieved by mixing urokinase and the activated peptide in appropriate proportions in an aqueous buffer and gently agitating the solution for 30 minutes.  \n<img id=\"EMI-C00141\" path=\"US20050074411A1-20050407-C00141.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/26344510/US/20050407/A1/020050/07/44/11/US20050074411A1-20050407-C00141.TIF\"/>\n<img id=\"EMI-C00142\" path=\"US20050074411A1-20050407-C00142.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/26344567/US/20050407/A1/020050/07/44/11/US20050074411A1-20050407-C00142.TIF\"/>\n</p> Fibrin targeted urokinase can be purified by HPLC. Binding to fibrin can be assessed. Compound 1 binds fibrin selectively versus fibrinogen. </p> The rabbit jugular vein model of Collen et al. (J. Clin. Invest. 1983, 71, 368-376) is used for thrombolysis assays.
