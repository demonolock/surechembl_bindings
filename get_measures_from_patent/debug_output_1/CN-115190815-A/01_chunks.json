    "ration side effects compared to their corresponding S enantiomers or racemates. In contrast, S isomers may have higher potency as anesthetics given their higher potency towards NMDAR. For example, compound 14R showed weaker NMDAR binding than rac-ketamine, (R) -ketamine, (S) -ketamine and 14S, suggesting that it may have less pronounced separation side effects than these compounds at equimolar doses. Many compounds of the invention exhibit affinity in the desired range of 1-5 \u03bc M, including, for example, 14R, 11S, 88R, 27rac, 29rac, 19S, 114S and 18rac. In some cases, the R isomer exhibits activity in the target affinity range, in other cases the S isomer is more desirable, and in some cases both stereoisomers or racemates fall within the desired range. In fact, the ratio of enantiomeric effects (eudymic ratios) for each pair of enantiomers varies widely, in some cases &lt;2, and in other cases ranging up to 10.</p><p id=\"p1152\" num=\"1148\">TABLE 11 binding affinity at MK-801 site of NMDAR.</p><p id=\"p1153\" num=\"1149\"></p><p id=\"p1154\" num=\"1150\"></p><p id=\"p1155\" num=\"1151\"></p><p id=\"p1156\" num=\"1152\">* Ebert et al 1997</p><p id=\"p1157\" num=\"1153\">* Mixture of all 4 diastereomers</p><p id=\"p1158\" num=\"1154\">Radioligand binding-method a.
