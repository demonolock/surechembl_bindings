    "refers to an interaction that is discriminated from unwanted or non-specific interactions. Discrimination includes but is not limited to affinity of ligand for a receptor molecule, for example, determined by ligand-receptor binding assays, such as phage displayed peptide ligand-cell binding assays, phage displayed peptide ligand biopsy screening, affinity purification, such as High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the like, competitive binding assays, panning assays, affinity assays, avidity assays, ELISA assays, etc., either qualitatively or quantitatively. For example, affinity may be measured qualitatively by a panning assay, ELISA, and the like, as shown by heat maps where affinity was depicted as mean absorbance values of indicated clones in ELISA assay) and specificity was determined by a ratio of clones' affinity to tumor cells versus normal ductal cells, for example, a specific peptide ligand binding interaction showed a 2 fold higher ratio of absorbance for PDAC cells versus normal ductal cells.</p>Further, affinity may be measured quantitatively by calculating an affinity constant (association constant) (K\u03b1) by measuring the strength of binding of the components in a complex, such that components A and B where a binding equilibrium is represented by A (ligand)+B (receptor molecule)=AB, the association constant is given by [AB]/[A][B], and becomes larger with tighter binding between A and B and smaller with looser binding between A and B. As opposed to a dissociation constant (Kd) referring to a measure of the tendency of a complex to dissociate such that a dissociation constant is represented by [A][B]/[AB], where a tighter binding results in a smaller Kd while a looser binding results in a larger Kd. For example, an association constant Kd for a selective binding molecule interaction with a ligand may range from 10<sup>\u22123 </sup>M to a picoM value, for example, an association constant Kd for a selective binding interaction is generally greater than 10<sup>\u22123 </sup>M, is preferably greater than 10<sup>\u22124 </sup>M, is more preferably greater than 10<sup>\u22125 </sup>M, and further more preferably greater than 10<sup>\u22126 </sup>M. High affinity interactions are generally greater than 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M to 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>M, and more preferably greater than 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>M.</p>As used herein, the term \u201cavidity\u201d refers to a total binding strength of a ligand with a receptor molecule, such that the strength of an interaction comprises multiple independent binding interactions between partners, which can be derived from multiple low affinity interactions or a small number of high affinity interactions.</p>As used herein, the term \u201cattach\u201d, or \u201cattachment\u201d, or \u201cattached\u201d, or \u201cattaching\u201d, used herein interchangeably with \u201cbind\u201d, or \u201cbinding\u201d or \u201cbinds\u2019 or \u201cbound\u201d refers to any physical relationship between molecules that results in forming a stable complex, such as a physical relationship between a ligand, such as a peptide or small molecule, with a \u201cbinding partner\u201d or \u201creceptor molecule.\u201d The relationship may be mediated by physicochemical interactions including, but not limited to, a selective noncovalent association, ionic attraction, hydrogen bonding, covalent bonding, Van der Waals forces or hydrophobic attraction.</p>The terms \u201cspecific binding\u201d or \u201cspecifically binding\u201d when used in reference to the interaction of a peptide (ligand) and a receptor (molecule) also refers to an interaction that is dependent upon the presence of a particular structure (i.e., an amino sequence of a ligand or a ligand binding domain within a protein); in other words the peptide comprises a structure allowing recognition and binding to a specific protein structure within a binding partner rather than to molecules in general. For example, if a ligand is specific for binding pocket \u201cA,\u201d in a reaction containing labeled peptide ligand \u201cA\u201d (such as an isolated phage displayed peptide or isolated synthetic peptide) and unlabeled \u201cA\u201d in the presence of a protein comprising a binding pocket A the unlabeled peptide ligand will reduce the amount of labeled peptide ligand bound to the binding partner, in other words a competitive binding assay.</p>\u201cSpecifically binds\u201d means that one molecule, such as a binding moiety, e.g., an oligonucleotide or antibody, binds preferentially to another molecule, such as a target molecule, e.g., a nucleic acid or a protein, in the presence of other molecules in a sample.</p>As used herein, the term \u201camino acid sequence,\u201d as used herein, refers to the primary (i.e., linear) structure of a protein, peptide, or polypeptide wherein the individual amino acids are linked by peptide bonds.</p>As used herein, the term \u201creceptor,\u201d as used herein, refers to any \u201cbinding molecule\u201d or \u201cbinding partner\u201d (e.g., a cancer cell protein \u201crecognized\u201d or \u201cbound\u201d or \u201celuted from\u201d a peptide ligand) including but not limited to a peptide, protein or glycoprotein to which an amino acid peptide sequence of the present invention appears to interact with or to specifically bind. For example, a binding molecule may reside on a cell surface or within a cell. An exemplary binding molecule is a plectin-1 molecule that interacts with SEQ ID NO:1 of the present invention. As used herein, the term \u201cbinding molecule\u201d also refers to a molecule of sufficient size and complexity expressed by a cancer cell or tumor cell so as to be capable of selectively binding a peptide ligand. Such molecules are generally macromolecules, such as polypeptides, however include nucleic acids, carbohydrates and lipids. The size of a binding molecule is not important so long as the molecule exhibits or can be made to exhibit",
    "ligand, Clone 27, and discovered plectin-1 as a biomarker for pancreatic cancer cells contemplated for clinical utility in the diagnosis, management and treatment of PDAC in humans.</p>Phage display was used to identify peptides that distinguish mouse and human PDAC cells from normal pancreatic duct cells in vitro. The two peptides with the highest affinities and specificities were conjugated to magnetofluorescent nanoparticles (CLIO-VT680), and were demonstrated to effectively detect emerging tumors and pre-neoplastic lesions in a relevant transgenic mouse model via intravital confocal microscopy (Olympus IV100) and optical/MR imaging (OV-100, Bruker Pharmascan). Correlative histology confirmed the specific temporal localization of the PDAC targeted agents. Additionally, the peptide-binding partners identified from this approach represent a snapshot of the proteome in aberrant cells and also potential PDAC biomarkers. Using affinity chromatography, the binding partners for several peptides were identified, and their validity as biomarkers was demonstrated. These specific and sensitive probes are useful in the diagnosis and management of PDAC, e.g., in humans.</p>Methods for determining the sequence of identified binding molecules are also described herein. For example, when the binding molecules are produced in an expression library, encoding nucleic acids can be isolated from selected clones expressing binding molecules identified in a screen, such a ligand-target receptor binding assay. The encoding nucleic acids of the virions that bound to a target can then be sequenced using methods known to those skilled in the art.</p>Also described herein are methods for characterizing biomarkers that are selectively bound by a binding molecule, such as a peptide ligand. Once a binding partner (e.g., a peptide ligand) has been identified that is selective for a biomarker, the biomarker can then be isolated by, for example, affinity methods known in the art, and characterized. This characterization can be beneficial if the biomarkers used in the screen are not well characterized. Characterization of the biomarker includes such techniques as determining its apparent molecular weight by gel electrophoresis. Other methods applicable for characterizing biomarkers include, for example, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), mass spectrometry, or other methods that provide information about the physical, biochemical or functional properties of the biomarker, e.g., sequence and identity. Numerous methods are available for such characterization of biomarkers.</p>In preferred embodiments, biomarkers are derived from the cell surface of tumor cells. Cell surface molecules can be labeled, for example, with a detectable moiety such as a radioisotope or biotin or a fluorescence label. This labeling provides a source of biomarker where the only characteristic that needs to be known is that it is on the surface of a cell. As described in the Examples, cancer cel",
    "tion and Nova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes targeted to selected cells with monoclonal antibodies to cellular antigens) can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,811.</p>Dosage, toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the therapeutic compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compounds which exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred.</p>The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.</p>A therapeutically effective amount of a therapeutic compound (i.e., an effective dosage) depends on the therapeutic compounds selected. The compositions can be administered one from one or more times per day to one or more times per week; including once every other day. The skilled artisan will appreciate that certain factors may influence the dosage and timing required to effectively treat a subject, including but not limited to the severity of the disease or disorder, previous treatments, the general health and/or age of the subject, and other diseases present. Moreover, treatment of a subject with a therapeutically effective amount of the therapeutic compounds described herein can include a single treatment or a series of treatments.</p>Concentration ranges of a drug in vitro in which peptide ligand targeting may enhance the ability of a drug to selectively kill cancer cells depend, usually, on the drug used. For example, genotoxin is used usually at a concentration in vitro between 0.1 to 100, \u03bcM, preferably between 0.15 to 30 \u03bcM/kg.</p>Therapeutic compositions of peptide ligands that deliver drugs to cancer cells may increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to addit"
