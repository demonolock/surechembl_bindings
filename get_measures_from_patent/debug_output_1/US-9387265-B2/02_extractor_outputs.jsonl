{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that meet the specified criteria. The text snippet provided does not contain specific molecule names, IDs, or other identifiers along with a bioactivity metric, a specific numeric value for that metric, and a unit for that value.

{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n* For example, genotoxin is used usually at a concentration in vitro between 0.1 to 100 \u03bcM, preferably between 0.15 to 30 \u03bcM/kg.\n* A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. \n\nNote that only two sentences contain all four required components: a specific molecule name (genotoxin), a bioactivity metric (concentration, IC50), a specific numeric value (0.1, 100, 0.15, 30), and a unit (\u03bcM, \u03bcM/kg). However, the second sentence does not contain a specific numeric value for IC50, so it may not fully meet the criteria. \n\nIf we are strict about the criteria, the only sentence that fully meets the requirements is:\n\n* For example, genotoxin is used usually at a concentration in vitro between 0.1 to 100 \u03bcM, preferably between 0.15 to 30 \u03bcM/kg."}
