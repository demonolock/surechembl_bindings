    " preservation of live cells can be performed on, as appropriate, one or more of: pluralities of cells, cell cultures, tissue cultures, tissues, organs, organ parts, blastoderms, embryoid bodies or embryos. The above methods can be performed on thawed cells, cell cultures, tissue cultures, tissues, organs, organ parts, blastoderms, embryoid bodies or embryos.</p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURESFIG. 1 depicts structures of small molecules.</p>FIG. 2 is a schematic illustration of the procedure used for quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS).</p>FIG. 3 is a scatter plot of maximum survival achieved by the screened compounds (plotted on the X-axis). The survival values plotted on the Y-axis were normalized based on the survival achieved at 10 \u03bcM Y-27632 (taken to be 100%).</p>FIG. 4 shows line plots of dose-response curves of selected ROCK inhibitors Chroman 1, Fasudil HCL, Thiazovivin and Y-27632. Molar concentrations of the selected ROCK inhibitors are plotted on the X-axis (log scale). Four replicates were tested for each concentration and the data were normalized with respect to the average CellTiter Glow\u2122 (CTG) reading obtained from 10 \u03bcM Y-27632 Thusly normalized data are plotted on the Y-axis.</p>FIG. 5 shows a bar graph illustrating the comparison of the effects of Y-27632 and Chroman 1 on the survival of dissociated H9 cells (reduced number of propidium iodide-positive dead cells) seeded into vitronectin coated 6-well plates.</p>FIG. 6 is a line plot illustrating half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of Y-27632 determined in kinase assays against ROCK1 and ROCK2 using the HotSpot Kinase Assay performed by Reaction Biology Corporation (Malvern, Pa.).</p>FIG. 7 is a line plot illustrating the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of Chroman 1 determined in kinase assays against ROCK1 and ROCK2 using the HotSpot Kinase Assay performed by Reaction Biology Corporation (Malvern, Pa.).</p>FIG. 8 is a table summarizing the inhibitory activity of 10 \u03bcM Y-27632 and 50 nM Chroman 1.</p>FIG. 9 shows the results of combinatorial matrix screening for the combination of Chroman 1 and caspase inhibitor Emricasan and the combination of Chroman 1 and (\u2212)-Blebbistatin.</p>FIG. 10 shows a bar graph illustrating improved cell survival when Chroman 1 and Emricasan were combined. CellTiter-Glo\u00ae assay was used to quantify viable H9 cells 24 hours post-plating (100,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>).</p>FIG. 11 shows phase-contrast microscopy images of a time-lapse experiments monitoring cell behavior over 24 hours (IncuCyte Zoom\u2122 Live Cell Analysis, Sartorius, DE).</p>FIG. 12 is a bar graph illustrating the validation of hits from the primary screening of dissociated stem cells at low cell density.</p>FIG. 13 shows bar graphs colony formation rate and colony size of H9 cells when treated with different small molecules and small molecule combinations.</p>FIG. 14 shows representative microscopic images of the colonies that were obtained with Y-27632 and CEPT as quantified in FIG. 14. Whole-well images (6-well plate) were captured with calcein green (0.5 \u03bcg/mL; obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p>FIG. 15 shows bar graphs summarizing the results of single-cell cloning expe"
