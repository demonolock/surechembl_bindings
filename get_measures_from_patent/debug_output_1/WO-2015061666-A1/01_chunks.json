Fusions to an Fc portion of an immunoglobulin or linkage to a polyoxyethylene moiety (e.g., polyethylene glycol) may be particularly useful to increase the serum half-life of the endoglin polypeptide in systemic administration (e.g., intravenous, intraarterial and intra-peritoneal administration).

As shown in Figure 36, analysis of these purified samples by size-exclusion chromatography revealed the quality of hENG(26-346)-hFc protein (96% monomeric) to be superior to that of hENG(26-359)-hFc protein (84% monomeric) and equivalent to that of hENG(26-586)-hFc protein (96% monomeric). Thus, greater levels of high- molecular- weight aggregates require the use of additional purification steps for hENG(26-359)-hFc compared to hENG(26-346)-hFc. </p>Example 9: High-affinity binding of BMP-9 / BMP-10 to truncated hENG-hFc variants </p> Applicants used SPR methodology to screen the following hENG-hFc protein variants for high-affinity binding to human BMP-9 and BMP-10.

High-affinity binding to BMP-9 and BMP- 10 was lost for all N-terminal truncations of greater than 61 amino acids that were tested. </p>A panel of ligands were screened for potential binding to the C-terminal truncated variants hENG(26-346)-hFc, hENG(26-359)-hFc, and hENG(26-437)-hFc. High-affinity binding of these three proteins was selective for BMP-9 and BMP-10. Neither hENG(26-346)-hFc, hENG(26-359)-hFc, nor hENG(26-437)-hFc displayed detectable binding to BMP-2, BMP-7, TGF-\u03b2\u0399, TGF-P2, TGF-P3, or activin A, even at high ligand concentrations. </p>Ligand Construct Binding </p> hENG(26-346)- hENG(26-359)- hENG(26-437)- hFc* hFc** hFc** </p>hBMP-2 - hBMP-2/7 - hBMP-7 - hBMP-9 ++++ ++++ ++++ </p>hBMP-10 ++++ ++++ ++++ </p>hTGF-\u03b2\u0399 - hTGF-p2 - hTGF-p3 - hActivin A - - -</p>* [hBMP-9], [hBMP-10] = 5 nM; [hTGF^3] = 50 nM; all other ligands tested at 100 nM </p> ** [hBMP-9], [hBMP-10] = 5 nM; [hTGF^3] = 50 nM; all other ligands tested at 100 nM </p>++++ KD &lt; 1 nM </p> - Binding undetectable </p>Applicants used SPR methodology to compare the kinetics of BMP-9 binding by five constructs: hENG(26-586)-hFc, hENG(26-437)-hFc, hENG(26-378)-hFc, hENG(26-359)-hFc, and hENG(26-346)-hFc. Figure 37 shows binding curves for several of the constructs, and the table below lists calculated values for the </p>equilibrium dissociation constants and dissociation rate constants (kd). The affinity of human BMP-9 for hENG(26-359)-hFc or hENG(26-346)-hFc (with K<sub>D</sub>s in the low picomolar range) was nearly an order of magnitude stronger than for the full-length construct. It is highly desirable for ligand traps such as ENG-Fc to exhibit a relatively slow rate of ligand dissociation, so the ten-fold improvement (decrease) in the BMP-9 \n\n dissociation rate for hENG(26-346)-hFc compared to the full-length construct is particularly noteworthy. </p>Ligand Construct K<sub>D</sub> (x 10<sup>\"12</sup> M) k<sub>d</sub> (x 10<sup>\"4</sup> s<sup>\"1</sup>) hBMP-9 hENG(26-586)-hFc * 33 25 </p> hENG(26-437)-hFc ** 19 14 hENG(26-378)-hFc ** 6.7 3.4 hENG(26-359)-hFc * 4.2 3.5 hENG(26-346)-hFc * 4.3 2.4</p>* CHO-cell-derived protein </p> ** HEK293-cell-derived protein </p>As shown below, each of the truncated variants also bound BMP- 10 with higher affinity, and with better kinetics, compared to the full-length construct. Even so, the truncated variants differed in their degree of preference for BMP-9 over BMP- 10 (based on K<sub>D</sub> ratio), with hENG(26-346)-hFc displaying the largest differential and hENG(26-437)-hFC the smallest. This difference in degree of ligand preference among the truncated variants could potentially translate into meaningful differences in their activity in vivo. </p>Ligand Construct K<sub>D</sub> (x 10<sup>\"12</sup> M) k<sub>d</sub> (x 10<sup>\"4</sup> s<sup>\"1</sup>) hBMP-10 hENG(26-586)-hFc * 490 110 </p> hENG(26-437)-hFc ** 130 28",

In a preliminary experiment, the truncated variant hENG(26-346) also slowed tumor growth compared to vehicle in the Colon- 26 xenograft model, consistent with the antiangiogenic activity of this variant in the mouse angioreactor assay (Example 13). Taken together, the aforementioned results demonstrate that fusion proteins comprising the full-length ENG ECD, and certain truncated variants thereof, display high-affinity binding to BMP-9 and BMP- 10 but not a variety of other TGFP-family \n\n ligands, including TGFP-l and TGFP-3. These ENG polypeptides can inhibit angiogenesis and tumor growth in model systems and thus have the potential to treat patients with unwanted angiogenesis, including those with cancer. Compared to constructs comprising the full-length ENG ECD, the truncated ENG polypeptides hENG(26-346)-hFc and/or hENG(26-359)-hFc displayed higher potency and </p>improved performance on several other key parameters (see summary table below). </p>Parameter ECD Polypeptide in Fusion Protein </p> (CHO cell derived) </p> Full length ECD - Human 26-359 Human 26-346</p>Human 26-586 or </p> Murine 27-581 </p> Expression Quantity 31 mg/L 9 mg/L 90 mg/L </p> Quality 96% monomeric 84% monomeric 96% monomeric</p>Binding affinity BMP-9 33 pM 4.2 pM 4.3 pM</p>(K<sub>D</sub>) BMP- 10 490 pM 86 pM 140 pM</p>Dissociation rate BMP-9 25 x 10<sup>\"4</sup> s<sup>\"1</sup> 3.5 x 10<sup>\"4</sup> s<sup>\"1</sup> 2.4 x 10<sup>\"4</sup> s<sup>\"1</sup></p>(kd) BMP- 10 HO x 10<sup>\"4</sup> s<sup>\"1</sup> 23 x 10<sup>\"4</sup> s<sup>\"1</sup> 28 x 10<sup>\"4</sup> s<sup>\"1</sup></p>Potency BMP-9 0.26 nM 0.16 nM 0.19 nM</p>(cell-based IC<sub>50</sub>) BMP- 10 7.9 nM 3.5 nM 4.6 nM</p>Elimination half-life 22 h 26.5 h</p>Anti-angiogenesis HUVEC Yes </p>activity CAM 65% inhibition 75% inhibition </p> Angioreactor 100% inhibition 100% inhibition</p>Anti-tumor 4T1 tumor Yes </p>activity Colon-26 Yes \u2014 Yes tumor Dose-dependent </p> \u2014 Not investigated </p> Variant hENG(26-346)-hFc, in particular, possessed a superior combination of attributes, with higher potency, stronger binding affinity, slower dissociation rate, longer elimination half-life, and better protein production than full-length ENG ECD constructs. As ligand traps, truncated ENG polypeptides should preferably exhibit a slow rate of ligand dissociation, so the ten-fold reduction in the BMP-9 dissociation rate for hENG(26-346)-hFc compared to the full-length construct is highly desirable. The variant hENG(26-378)-hFc displayed BMP-9 binding properties (affinity and dissociation rate) intermediate between hENG(26-346)-hFc and hENG(26-359)-hFc, on one hand, and hENG(26-437)-hFc, on the other, with hENG(26-378) more closely resembling the shorter constructs. </p>Example 16: Treatment of a mouse model of liver fibrosis with ENG-Fc proteins \n\n The effectiveness of ENG-Fc proteins in the treatment of fibrosis was evaluated in the mouse CCL4 (carbon tetrachloride) model of liver fibrosi"
