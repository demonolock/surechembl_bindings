    "tures were taken at 48 hours and quantified using photoshop and ImageJ.</p>Cell adhesion assayNinety-six (96) wells plate was coated with 1 \u00b5M of EDA-his or III4-his fragments for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C, then blocked with PBS 1%BSA. NIH3T3 0.5x10^5 cells were added per well in bare DMEM and incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. After washing of unattached cells, the attached cells were fixed and stained using 0.5% crystal violet 1% formaldehyde, 20% methanol. The plate was read with a microplate reader at 540 nm.</p>Protein purificationBL21 pLysS E.coli were transformed with 1 \u00b5l of the DNA constructs and plated on Yeast tryptone ampicillin/chloramphenicol plates overnight. The next day all the colonies were scraped off and grown in LB medium with Amp/Chlor till an OD of 0.6-0.8 was reached. IPTG was added to start the production of the protein. After 24 hours, bacteria were pelleted and lysed, using lysis buffer and sonication steps. Debris was pelleted and supernatant was used for further processing. Ni-NTA beads were used for his purification. Briefly, Ni-NTA beads were incubated ON with supernatant at 4\u00b0C. Beads were poured into columns on the ACTA system. After a couple of washes, bound EDA-his or III4-his was eluted using 300 mM imidazole. Fractions containing EDA-his or III4-his were collected and injected on a gel filtration column. Proteins were separated based on size and eluted in HEPES buffer. Fractions containing EDA-his or III4-his were pooled and concentrated using Vivaspin 5 kD concentration columns. Fragment concentration was assed using BCA kit. LAL assays were performed to check for endotoxins. Fragments were used with a concentration lower than &lt;0.1 EU per uM .</p>HistologyUpon termination, hearts were excised and fixated in 4% formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin sections were stained for Ly-6G (for neutrophils; rat anti-mouse Ly-6G, Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom), MAC-3 (for macrophages; rat anti-mouse MAC-3, BD Pharmingen, Breda, the Netherlands) and CD31 (for vessels, Santa Cruz, Heidelberg, Germany).</p>Before staining, sections were deparaffinized and endogenous peroxidase was blocked by 30 minutes incubation in methanol containing 1.5% H2O2. Antigen retrieval was performed by 20 minutes boiling in citrate buffer (MAC-3 and CD31) or by 15 minutes incubation at 37\u00b0C in a 0.08% pepsin solution (Ly-6G).</p>For MAC-3 staining, sections were pre-incubated with normal goat serum and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C (MAC-3, 1:30; CD163, 1:500). For CD31 staining, sections were incubated overnight at RT with the primary antibody (1:1500). Sections were then incubated for 1 hour at RT with a biotin labeled secondary goat antibody and 1 hour incubation with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase at RT. All sections were developed with AEC.</p>For Ly-6G, sections were incubated for 1 hour at RT with the primary antibody (1:100). Sections were then incubated for 30 minutes with Powervision poly-HRP anti-rabbit IgG (ImmunoVision Technologies"
