In some embodiments, the cancer is lung cancer, breast cancer, or prostate cancer.</p>Agents that modulate the activity of fascin can be used to treat a variety of diseases and conditions. For example, as illustrated herein, fascin promotes actin bundling and plays a key role in cell migration and metastasis of cancer cells. Hence, modulators and inhibitors of fascin can be used to treat and inhibit metastatic cancer.</p>However, fascin also plays a role in other diseases and conditions. For example, neurite shape and trajectory is modulated by fascin (Kraft et al., Phenotypes of Drosophila brain neurons in primary culture reveal a role for fascin in neurite shape and trajectory, J. Neurosci, 26(34):8734-47 (2006)). Fascin is also involved in neuronal degeneration (Fulga et al., Abnormal bundling and accumulation of F-actin mediates tau-induced neuronal degeneration in vivo Nat Cell Biol. 9(2):139-48 (2007)). In addition, fascin plays a role in Hodgkin's disease (Pinkus et al., Fascin, a sensitive new marker for Reed-Sternberg cells of Hodgkin's disease, Am J Pathol. 150(2):543-562 (1997)). Fascin also plays a role in processing and presenting antigens, for example, on antigen presenting cells (Mosialos et al., Circulating human dendritic cells differentially express high levels of a 55-kd actin-bundling protein. Am. J. Pathol. 148(2):593-600 (1996); Said et al. The role of follicular and inter digitating dendritic cells in HIV-related lymphoid hyperplasia: localization of fascin. Mod Pathol. 10(5):421-27 (1997)). Moreover, fascin also plays a role in ischemic injury (Meller et al., Ubiquitin proteasome-mediated synaptic reorganization: a novel mechanism underlying rapid ischemic tolerance, J Neurosci. 28(1):50-9 (2008)).</p>Provided herein are agents that modulate fascin activity and that can be used for methods of treating and inhibiting metastatic cancer, neuronal disorders, neuronal degeneration, inflammatory conditions, viral infections, bacterial infections, lymphoid hyperplasia, Hodgkin's disease, and ischemia-related tissue damage.</p>Tumor metastasis is the major cause of death of cancer patients (Weiss 2000, Fidler 2003). Thus, inhibition or prevention of tumor metastasis will significantly increase the survival rate of cancer patients, allow more moderate radiation or chemotherapy with less side-effects, and control the progression of solid tumors.</p>Tumor cell migration and invasion are critical steps in the process of tumor metastasis (Partin et al. 1989, Aznavoorian et al. 1993, Condeelis et al. 2005). For cell migration to proceed, the actin cytoskeleton must be reorganized by forming polymers and bundles to affect the dynamic changes of cell shapes (Jaffe et al. 2005, Matsudaira 1994, Otto 1994). Individual actin filaments are flexible and e"
