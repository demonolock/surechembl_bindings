    " allograft rejection, and graft vs host disease.</p>It is reported that many diseases are associated with abnormal cellular responses triggered by protein kinase-mediated events. These diseases include autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, bone diseases, metabolic diseases, neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, allergies and asthma, Alzheimer's disease and hormone-related diseases. In addition, endothelial cell specific receptor PTKs, such as VEGF-2 and Tie-2, mediate the angiogenic process and are involved in supporting the progression of cancers and other diseases involving uncontrolled vascularization. Accordingly, there has been a substantial effort in medicinal chemistry to find protein kinase inhibitors that are effective as therapeutic agents.</p>One kinase family of particular interest is the Src family of kinases. Src kinase is involved in proliferation and migration responses in many cell types, cell activation, adhesion, motility, and survival, growth factor receptor signaling, and osteoclast activation (Biscardi et al., Adv. Cancer Res. (1999), 76, 61-119; Yeatman et al., Nat. Rev. Cancer (2004), 4, 470-480; Owens, D. W.; McLean et al., Mol. Biol. Cell (2000), 11, 51-64), Members of the Src family include the following eight kinases in mammals: Src, Fyn, Yes, Fgr, Lyn, Hck, Lck, and Blk (Bolen et al., Annu. Rev. Immunol, (1997), 15, 371), These are nonreceptor protein kinases that range in molecular mass from 52 to 62 kD. All are characterized by a common structural organization that is comprised of six distinct functional domains: Src homology domain 4 (SH4), a unique domain, SH3 domain, SH2 domain, a catalytic domain (SH1), and a C-terminal regulatory region [Brown et al., Biochem Biophys Acta (1996), 1287, 121-149; Tatosyan et al. Biochemistry (Moscow) 2000, 65, 49-58). SH4 domain contains the myristylation signals that guide the Src molecule to the cell membrane. This unique domain of Src proteins is responsible for their specific interaction with particular receptors and protein targets (Thomas et al., Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol (1997), 13, 513-609). The modulating regions, SH3 and SH2, control intra\u2014as well as intermolecular interactions with protein substrates which affect Src catalytic activity, localisation and association with protein targets (Pawson T., Nature (1995), 373, 573-580). The kinase domain, SH1. found in all proteins of the Src family, is responsible for the tyrosine kinase activity and has a central role in binding of substrates. The N-terminal half of Src kinase contains the site(s) for its tyrosine phosphorylation and regulates the catalytic activity of Src (Thomas et al., Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol (1997), 13: 513-609). v-Src differs from cellular Src (c-Src) on the basis of the structural differences in C-terminal region responsible for regulation of kinase activity.</p>The prototype member of the Src family protein tyrosine kinases was originally identified as the trans"
