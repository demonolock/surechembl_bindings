    " 1. For this assay JZA1 was first pre-induced. Briefly, JZA1 was grown in LB liquid medium containing 1 \u03bcg/ml tetracycline, 100 \u03bcg/ml spectinomycin and 100 \u03bcg/ml gentamycin at 28\u00b0 C. until the late-log phase. 1 ml of the culture was added into 100 ml AT medium containing antibiotics at 28\u00b0 C. until it entered the mid-log phase. Bacteria were then collected by centrifuging (12000 g, 10 min) and resuspended in 15% sterilized glycerol for freezing. To perform the membrane retention assay, H9 cells were incubated with HSLs at 37\u00b0 C. Then the cells and supernatants were collected separately by centrifuging (1500 rpm, 5 min). The cells were treated with Buffer #1 (20 mM Tris-HCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol) on ice to break membrane. Cytosol and membrane fragments were separated by ultra-centrifuging (179000 g, 24 min, 4\u00b0 C.). The membrane fragments were dissolved in Buffer #2 (Buffer #1 with 1% Triton-X100). HSLs in the fractions were extracted with ethyl acetate and air dried at RT. The samples were then dissolved in DMSO and cultured with 2 \u03bcl pre-induced JZA1 strain in 2 ml AT medium at 28\u00b0 C. for 20 hrs. As OD 600 nm reached 0.2-1, the bacteria were lysed by mixing 200 \u03bcl cell culture with 200 \u03bcl Z buffer 4, 10 \u03bcl 0.05% SDS and 15 \u03bcl chloroform. 100 \u03bcl ONPG (4 mg/ml) was added into each sample and the time TO was recorded. The reactions were terminated by adding 600 \u03bcl 1M NaCO3 and the time Ts recorded. Their OD 420 nm was measured to determine the Miller unit.</p>Lipid Binding Assay</p>1 mg/ml of each lipid species in chloroform was coated on round glass slides by evaporation.</p>Then the glass slices were incubated with 100 \u03bcM 3OC12 HSL in DMSO in PBS at 37\u00b0 C. After the incubation, the glass slices were washed slightly with PBS for 4-5 times and lipids were dissolved with DMSO. The amount of 3OC12 HSL in each sample was measured by QS bioassay as described above.</p>Single Molecule Fluorescence Imaging</p>Optical setup: Single-molecule fluorescence detection was performed on a home-built objective type total internal reflection fluorescence microscope (TIRFM) based on an inverted Zeiss Observer-A 1 stand. Briefly, a laser combiner that contains 4 single-wavelength CW lasers (405, 488, 561, and 640 nm) (Coherent) was used as the excitation light source. The excitation light was introduced to the excitation path via a polarization-preserved single-mode optical fiber and a reflective collimator. The light was first gated by an acousto-optic turnable filter (AOTF), then expended by 5 times with a pair of lenses, and lastly focused on the back focal plan of an Olympus TIRF objective (100\u00d7, NA 1.49) with a lens (f=150 mm) that can be translated perpendicular to the optical axis to achieve variable incident angle. The fluorescence signal is collected by the same objective and then filtered and spectrally separated with Optosplit II (Cairn Research) before being projected to an electron-multiplying charge coupled device (EMCCD) camera (Andor iXon"
