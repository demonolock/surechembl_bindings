In one embodiment, the present invention relates to compositions and methods for post-translationally modifying a synthetic protein in a subject. In one aspect, the invention provides a composition comprising a first recombinant nucleic acid sequence encoding the synthetic protein, and a second recombinant nucleic acid sequence encoding a modifier protein</p>The composition can be administered to a subject in need thereof to facilitate in vivo expression, formation, and post-translationally modification of a synthetic protein.</p>In particular, the synthetic protein and modifier protein from the recombinant nucleic acid sequences are expressed and the modifier protein post-translationally modifies the synthetic protein. The post-translationally modified synthetic protein has increased biologic activity as compared to a protein not expressed and modified as described herein.</p>In one embodiment, the wherein the modifier protein catalyzes a post translational modification (PTM) on the synthetic protein, wherein the PTM is selected from the group consisting of post translational modification is selected from the group consisting of sulfation, acetyl",
    "; Weinberg et al., 2014), and transduction of muscles cells by both AAV-TPST2 and AAV-eCD4-Ig can occur in a stochastic fashion.</p>The results also support an approach to target an enzyme to the specific subcellular compartment to maximize its functions. While the efficiency of IgE-TPST2 mediated sulfation appears similar to that of TPST2-mediated sulfation (FIG. 1D), selective targeting of the IgE-TPST2 can potentially reduce cytosolic expression of the enzyme and off-target sulfation. The approach can be further extended to target proteins to other subcellular compartments for therapeutic and investigational purposes. For example, an N-terminal sequence consisting of 10-70 amino acids can target a protein to the mitochondria; dileucine motif DXXLL, or a tyrosine-based motif YXX\u00d8, in the cytoplasmic tail of a transmembrane protein can target proteins to the lysosome; whereas a unit of 5 basic positively charged amino acids on the poplypeptide chain can target a protein to the nucleus (Braulke and Bonifacino, 2009; Lange et al., 2007; Regev-Rudzki et al., 2008).</p>Finally, it is demonstrated herein that DNA/EP enables robust and long-term in vivo expression of immunoadhesins like ReCD4-Ig. With a single round of injection, a peak expression level of 80-100 ug/mL in mice was observed, with levels that remains above 3 ug/mL for 150 days. This in vivo delivery results in validated breadth and potency of ReCD4-Ig, which can neutralize all isolates from the global panel with an IC50 less than 5 ug/mL and a mean IC50 of 0.27 ug/mL.</p>In summary, several advances to target an enzyme to the secretory compartment of the cells and the use of DNA/EP for its in vivo expression resulting in significant in vivo potency are described. Importantly, the DNA/EP delivered IgE-TPST2 can significantly enhance potency of eCD4-Ig through in vivo post-translational sulfation likely requires further study as a tool to target HIV infection.</p>The materials and methods are now described.</p>Animals</p>6-8 week old female balb/c and B6.Cg-Foxn1nuJ were obtained from either Charles River (Wilimgton, Mass.) or Jackson laboratory (Bar Harbor, Me.). For DNA delivery, mice were given single intraperitoneal injection of 500 ug of anti-mouse CD40L (clone MR-1, BioXCell) for transient immuno-modulation. They were then given 160 ug (2 injections, left and right TAs) or 320 ug (4 injections, left and right quadriceps, left and right TAs) of DNA co-formulated with 12U of hyaluronidase (Hylenex, catalogue: 18657-117-04) (26,27). 1 minute after injections, IM-EP was performed at each injection site with the Cellectra 3P device (Inovio Pharmaceutical) (Broderick and Humeau, 2015).</p>DNA Design and Plasmid Synthesis</p>Protein sequence for ReCD4-Ig was obtained as previously described (Gardner et al., 2015). Protein sequences for human TPST2 and HS3SA were obtained from UniProt (accession numbers: 060704 and Q9Y663). Protein sequence for SIV<sub>mac239 </sub>was obtained from GenBank (accession number M33262). DNA en",
    "at 4\u00b0 C. with 1:200 dilution of anti-Golgin 97 antibody in 1% BSA/PBS-T, and 1:200 dilution of polyclonal rabbit anti-TPST2 antibody. The cells were then washed with PBS-T and stained with 1:500 dilution of Goat anti-Rabbit Alexa Fluor 594, and Goat anti-Mouse Alexa Fluor 488. For nuclear staining, the cells were incubated with 0.5 ug/mL of DAPI in PBS-T and mounted with cover slips using Prolonged Diamond AntiFade Mountant. Z-stack images were then acquired with Leica TCS SP5 II Scanning Confocal Microscope with a 64\u00d7 objective. Maximal projections of the Z-stacks, deconvolution, and regions of interest analyses were performed with Leica LASX software to obtain Pearson correlation coefficients to quantify TPST2 and Golgin 97 colocalization.</p>Ex Vivo Neutralization Assay</p>Synthesis of HIV Env pseudotyped viruses and TZM-bl assays were performed as previously described (Sarzotti-Kelsoe et al., 2014). Briefly, HEK293 T cells were transfected with 4 ug of plasmid encoding HIV envelope and Bug of plasmid encoding HIV backbone (pSG3Aenv) with GeneJammer. 48 hours after transfection, the supernatants were filtered with Steriflip and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. Pseudoviruses were titrated with a TZM-bl luciferase reporter assay using Britelight Plus to determine a titer that corresponds to at least 150,000 RLU. Mice sera were heat inactivated at 56\u00b0 C. for 10 minutes for the TZM-bl neutralization assays to determine serum concentration/titer that would result in 50% virus neutralization (IC50).</p>Statistics</p>One-way ANOVA analysis and pair-wise T-tests (with Holm-Bonferroni Adjustments in the case of multiple comparisons) were performed with GraphPad Prism 7.0. IC<sub>50 </sub>values were computed with a non-linear regression model of percentage neutralization versus log (reciprocal serum dilution) using Prism 7.0. P-values less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant.</p>REFERENCESAndrabi, R., Su, C. Y., Liang, C. H., Shivatare, S. S., Briney, B., Voss, J. E., Nawazi, S. K., Wu, C. Y., Wong, C.
