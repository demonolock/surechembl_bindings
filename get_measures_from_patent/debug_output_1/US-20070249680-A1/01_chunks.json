    "y, and were used to define the 100% and 0% inhibition of the c-fms reaction. The reported IC<sub>50 </sub>values are averages of three independent measurements.</p>CSF-1-Driven Mouse Bone-Marrow Derived Macrophages Assay</p>Macrophages are derived by culturing mouse bone marrow in alpha-MEM supplemented with 10% FCS and 50 ng/ml recombinant mouse CSF-1 in bacteriologic dishes. On the sixth day, macrophages are detached from dishes, washed, and resuspended to 0.05 million cells/ml in alpha-MEM containing 10% FCS. One hundred ul of cell suspension are distributed per well into 96 well culture plates. Wells are further supplemented with the addition of 50 ul media containing 15 ng/ml CSF-1, 3 uM Indomethacin, and 3\u00d7 of a dilution series of test compounds. The cells are cultured for 30 hrs at 37 degrees and 5% CO2. During the final six hours, cultures are supplemented with an additional 30 ul of media containing a 1:500 dilution of bromodeoxyuridine (BrDU). At the end of the culture period, the plates are spun at 1000 RPM for 1 minute and 130 ul of media is removed with a pipet and replaced with 150 ul of fixative solution for 1 hour @ room temperature. The fixative is then dispelled from the plates and the plates allowed to air dry. Incorporation of BrDU into the fixed, dried cells is quantified using a specific ELISA.</p>Table 2 lists the assay results for representative compounds of the invention.</p>TABLE 2mCSF driven1 nM c-fms;proliferationpeptide PiBMDMassay(Mouse)Example #IC-50 (\u03bcM)IC-50 (\u03bcM)10.00070.00420.000420.002230.0017N/A40.00180.01450.00050.002460.00160.01570.000670.01180.0040.01590.00190.1100.0079&gt;0.3110.00290.035120.00110.031130.00080.0081140.00390.0095150.00290.014160.000670.046170.00056&gt;0.3180.00360.3190.00180.019200.00180.02210.00160.0079220.0008&gt;0.3230.0064&gt;0.3240.00080.014250.000490.0065260.0030.0053270.00290.0045280.00840.028290.00160.011300.00320.007310.00140.003320.00320.019330.00370.033340.00150.0172350.00070.0058870.00110.0082880.00240.0064890.0130.02900.00650.0491~0.210.061920.00220.012930.00290.0089940.082&gt;0.1950.0260.029</p>While the foregoing specification teaches the principles of the present invention, with examples provided for the purpose of illustration, it will be understood that the practice of the invention encompasses all of the usual variations, adaptations and/or modifications as come within the scope of the following claims and their equivalents.</p>All publications disclosed in the above specification are hereby incorporated by reference in full.</p>"
