Values are mean of 3 independent experiments. *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01.(b) chemical structures of active correctors identified in silico(c) examples of iodide efflux curves obtained in HeLa cells stably transfected with \u0394F508-CFTR and treated for 24 hours with 10 \u03bcM with different compounds. CFTR dependent response was induced by 10 \u03bcM Forskolin (Fsk)+30 \u03bcM Genistein (Gsk) as indicated by the horizontal bar above the traces.(d) EC50 was determined for active compounds of pocket 2: 407882 and 73100 and one of pocket 1: 130813, for 118208 EC50 could not be precisely determined since the maximum of iodide efflux was not reached even at 100 \u03bcM (also shown).\n\nFIG. 2\n\n</p>To test whether the compounds exhibit potentiator activity independent of their effect on CFTR trafficking, we examined iodide efflux in untreated WT-CFTR HeLa cells. Compounds were added along with forskolin and their effects were compared to that of forskolin alone or forskolin plus genistein. Unlike genistein, all tested molecules induced an I<sup>\u2212</sup> efflux greater than that of forskolin alone.</p>FIG. 3</p>Potentiation was also tested in \u0394F508-CFTR HeLa cells treated for 2 hours with miglustat to rescue \u0394F508-CFTR. I<sup>\u2212</sup> efflux was stimulated either with forskolin alone, with forskolin plus genistein or forskolin plus the different compounds. As shown in the Figure, only genistein was able to increase efflux, demonstrating the absence of potentiation activity by The drugs.</p>FIG. 4</p>Impact of identified correctors on \u0394F508-CFTR maturation and cell localization.\n(a) Effects of different compounds on CFTR processing.

    "05-16(2002). Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton in PBS. Cells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumine in PBS/Triton and incubated at 4\u00b0 C. overnight with the primary antibodies, 24-1 (1:300). After washing and blocking with 5% normal goat serum, cells were incubated with the secondary antibodies. Glass coverslips were mounted using the Vectashield mounting medium (Vector laboratories) and examined by confocal laser microscopy (Zeiss, LSM 510).</p>Iodide Efflux Experiments</p>CFTR chloride channel activity was assayed by measuring iodide (<sup>125</sup>I) efflux from transfected CHO cells as described previously in the art, Marivingt-Mounir, C, et al., Synthesis, SAR, crystal structure, and biological evaluation of benzoquinoliziniums as activators of wild-type and mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator channels. J Med Chem, 2004. 47(4): p. 962-72.

J Med Chem, 2004. 47(4): p. 962-72. Cells grown for 4 days in 96-well plates were washed twice with 2 ml of modified Earle's salt solution containing 137 mM NaCl, 5.36 mM KCl, 0.4 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 0.8 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5.5 mM glucose, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. Cells were then incubated in the same medium containing 1 mM KI (1 mCi of Na<sup>125</sup>I/ml, NEN Life Science Products) for 30 min at 37\u00b0 C. After washing, cells were incubated with 1 ml of modified Earle's salt solution. After 1 min, the medium was removed to be counted and was quickly replaced by 1 ml of the same medium. This procedure was repeated every 1 min for 8 min. The first three aliquots were used to establish a stable baseline in efflux buffer alone. Medium containing cocktail aiming to increase intracellular cAMP (10 M forskolin and 30 \u03bcM genistein) was used for next aliquots in order to activate CFTR chloride channels. At the end of the incubation, the medium was recovered, and cells were solubilized in 1 N NaOH. The radioactivity was determined using a g-counter (LKB). The total amount of <sup>125</sup>I (in cpm) at time 0 was calculated as the sum of cpm counted in each 1-min sample plus the cpm in the NaOH fraction. The fraction of initial intracellular <sup>125</sup>I lost during each time point was determined, and time-dependent rates of <sup>125</sup>I efflux were calculated according to the art in, Becq, F., et al., Development of substituted Benzo[c]quinolizinium compounds as novel activators of the cystic fibrosis chloride channel. J Biol Chem, 1999. 274(39): p. 27415-25, from ln(<sup>125</sup>I<sub>t1</sub>/<sup>125</sup>I<sub>t2</sub>)/(t<sub>1</sub>\u2212t<sub>2</sub>), where</p><sup>125</sup>It is the intracellular <sup>125</sup>I at time t; and</p>t<sub>1 </sub>and t<sub>2 </sub>are successive time points.</p>C"
