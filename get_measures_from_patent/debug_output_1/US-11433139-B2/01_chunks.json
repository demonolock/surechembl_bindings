The column was then washed with 50 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, pH 8.2 and the eluted via a 150 mL linear gradient from 0 to 500 mM imidazole, each in wash buffer. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions having sufficient purity of IL-31 were pooled and buffer exchanged again by dialysis against 3 exchanges (2 L each) of PBS, at 4\u00b0 C., overnight. Finally, the folded and purified sample was collected from dialysis, sterile filtered, concentration measured aliquoted, snap-froze in a dry-ice/isopropanol bath, and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C.</p>1.4. Method to Determine Affinity of Anti-IL-31 Antibodies for IL-31 Using Surface Plasmon Resonance</p>The affinity with which candidate mAbs bind canine and feline IL-31 was determined using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) on a Biacore system (Biocore Life Sciences (GE Healthcare), Uppsala, Sweden). To avoid affinity differences associated with differential surface preparation that can occur when immobilizing antibodies to surfaces; a strategy was employed where IL-31 was directly conjugated to the surface. Immobilization was obtained by amine coupling 5 \u03bcg/mL IL-31 using N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)/1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) chemistry. Chips were quenched with ethanolamine and the affinity with which all candidate mAbs bound to the immobilized IL-31 was evaluated. All curves were fit to a 1:1 model. Affinity constants (KD) less than 1\u00d710<sup>\u221211</sup>M (1E-11 M) are below the lower limit of quantitation of detection for the instrument. Results for affinity measurements are described herein.</p>1.5. Method to Determine Potency of Anti-IL-31 Antibodies Assessed by Inhibition of Canine and Feline IL-31 Induced pSTAT3 Signaling in Canine and Feline Macrophage Cells</p>To identify candidates with inhibitory activity, antibodies were assessed for their ability to affect IL-31-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation in either a canine or feline cell-based assay. STAT3 phosphorylation was determined in canine DH-82 (ATCC\u00ae CRL-10389\u2122) or feline FCWF4 macrophage-like cells (ATCC CRL-2787). DH82 and FCWF4 cells were primed with canine interferon gamma (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.) at 10 ng/mL for 24 hours or feline interferon gamma (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.) at 125 ng/mL for 96 hours, respectively, to increase receptor expression. Both cell types were serum starved for 2 hours prior to IL-31 and mAb treatment. Using two independent methods, all candidate mAbs were evaluated for their ability to inhibit either 1 \u03bcg/mL canine or 0.2 \u03bcg/mL feline IL-31 induced STAT3 phosphorylation. Assays were also run to demonstrate cross-reactivity of canine and feline cytokines and cross-functionality of the antibodies ability to inhibit signaling in both species. To ensure complex formation, a one hour co-incubation of mAb and IL-31 cytokine prior to cell stimulation was completed. IL-31 cell stimulation was carried out for five minutes. STAT3 phosphorylation was measured using AlphaLISA SureFire ULTRA\u2122 technology (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Mass.). In the case where antibody concentration and purity are unknown, hybridoma supernatants were qualitatively measured for their ability to inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation following a 1 hour co-incubation with 1 mg/ml canine or 0.2 mg/ml feline IL-31. The potency of individual monoclonal antibodies defined by their ability to inhibit IL-31 mediated STAT3 phosphorylation in these assays was considered the key selection criteria for further advancement of select antibodies. The term potency refers to the IC50 value calculated from these assays and is the concentration of the antibody where signaling induced by IL-31 is reduced to one half its maximal value. Increased potency described herein correlates to a lower IC50 value.</p>1.6. Identification of Mouse and Canine Monoclonal Antibodies Recognizing Canine and Feline Interleukin 31</p>Mice and dogs were immunized with recombinant canine IL-31 (SEQ ID No. 155) for the purpose of identifying antibodies. Serum antibody titers from immunized animals were determined using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Canine or feline IL-31 (50 ng/well) was immobilized to polystyrene microplates and used as a capture antigen. Serum from immunized animals was diluted in phosphate buffered saline with 0.05% tween-20 (PBST). The presence of anti-IL-31 antibodies was detected with an appropriate secondary HRP labeled antibody. Following addition of a chromogenic substrate (SureBlue Reserve TMB 1-Component Microwell Peroxidase Substrate, KPL, Inc., Gaithersburg, Md.) and a ten minute incubation at room temperature (RT) the reaction was stopped with the addition of 1004 of 0.1 N HCl. The absorbance of each well was determined at an optical density (OD) of 450 nm. Antibodies were selected for their ability to bind canine and feline IL-31 using an ELISA. In some cases, further characterization was performed at the time of selection using an ELISA with a mutant form of the feline IL-31 protein as a capture antigen. Cells producing antibodies with desired binding and inhibitory properties were chosen for sequence analysis of RNA transcripts representing the variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) IgG chains.</p>In the case of mouse antibodies, d",

Affinity and cell based potency of select recombinant antibodies are described below.</p>FIG. 2 details the affinity of antibodies with CDRs derived from mouse origin using biacore. FIG. 2, Section A shows the affinity of mouse anti IL-31 antibodies 11 E12 and 15H05 and the corresponding affinities of the feline and canine chimeric forms to both feline and canine IL-31 surfaces. These observations confirm the correct sequence for both mouse antibodies and indicate conversion to the chimeric form results in antibodies with equivalent or higher affinity when compared to the mouse parent with the exception of the mouse:feline 15H05 chimera which lost some affinity to both IL-31 species as a result of its conversion to the chimeric form. Fully mouse and chimeric forms of antibodies 11E12 and 15H05 were also tested for activity in the canine and feline cellular assays described in section 1.5. FIG. 3 shows the results for these assays. Mouse antibodies 11 E12 and 15H05 were tested for activity against canine and feline cell types using both canine and feline IL-31 to stimulate signaling. The potency of both mouse antibodies was comparable against both canine and feline cells using the feline cytokine with the exception of 15H05 against feline IL-31 in feline FCWF4 cells that shows a slight increase in IC50. Mouse 15H05 was capable of blocking canine IL-31 signaling in both feline and canine cells with the potency in the canine assay being slightly higher. These results indicate that the respective epitopes recognized by these antibodies exists on both canine and feline IL-31 and binding of these antibodies is capable of neutralizing receptor-mediated cellular signaling in a relevant cell line from both species.</p>FIG. 3 also describes the potency of select chimeras in both cellular assays. Conversion of mouse antibodies to feline and canine chimeras had minimal impact on the potency against feline IL-31 in the feline potency assay (IC50 range 1.15-3.45 \u03bcg/ml). Similar results were observed when these chimeras were tested against feline IL-31 signaling on the canine DH82 cell line with a slight increase in potency (IC50=0.71 \u03bcg/ml) observed for the 15H05 mouse: canine chimera. In general there was an increase in IC50 values against canine IL-31 in both canine and feline cell types. The mouse: feline 15H05 chimera was slightly less potent in this assay format compared to the mouse: canine form (IC50 28.61 vs. 12.49 \u03bcg/ml). Consistent with observations for the mouse antibodies, conversion to canine and feline chimeric forms resulted in minimal changes in potency.</p>Antibodies described above that were identified from single B cells of immunized dogs were constructed as recombinant IgG proteins following identification of their variable domain sequences. Grafting of these variable domains onto the canine heavy chain Fc (65_1 isotype) resulted in the generation of recombinant fully canine antibodies. It was of interest to identify additional canine antibodies that bound wildtype feline IL-31 and who's binding was decreased to the feline IL-31 15H05 mutant (i.e. are directed at the 15H05 epitope). These antibodies obtained from this alternate source (canine vs. mouse) provide additional paratopes (the portion of the antibody which recognizes the IL-31 protein, includes CDRs) recognizing the 15H05 epitope thus increasing the diversity of antibodies with different physical properties to select from.</p>FIG. 4 shows the results obtained for binding of these recombinant canine antibodies to various proteins using both ELISA and Biacore methods. For the indirect ELISA method, antibody binding to wildtype and feline IL-31 15H05 mutant proteins was assessed. All nine canine monoclonal antibodies (ZIL1, ZIL8, ZIL8, ZIL11, ZIL69, ZIL94, ZIL154, ZIL159, and ZIL171) were capable of binding to wildtype feline IL-31 and binding was impacted by mutations in the mAb 15H05 epitope reg",
    "oteins and a total loss of binding with the Feline 11E12 1.2 mAb when compared to the mouse form of the antibody (FIG. 2, Section B). Potency of these speciated antibodies was tested in the canine DH82 and Feline FCWF4 cell assays using the feline IL-31 cytokine. Felinized 11E12 1.1 had approximately a two-fold decrease in potency against feline IL-31 in the feline FCWF assay when compared to the mouse version of the antibody. In agreement with the loss of affinity for felinized 11E12 1.2, a complete loss of cellular potency was observed for this antibody (FIG. 3). Based on previous experience during caninization of the mAb 11E12 ortholog, a similar strategy was undertaken in attempt to restore the affinity loss to felinization (U.S. Pat. No. 8,790,651 to Bammert, et al.). Substitution of the felinized framework 2 (FW2) region of Feline 11E12 VL1 with the mouse FW2 from (SEQ ID NO: 73; Mu_11E12_VL) the corresponding nucleotide sequence for which is (SEQ ID NO: 74; Mu_11E12_VL) was done to generate Feline 11E12 VL1 FW2. In addition, a single substitution at position 46 of the feline VL (K46Q) was performed to generate (SEQ ID NO: 119; FEL_11E12_VL1_K46Q) the corresponding nucleotide sequence for which is (SEQ ID NO: 120; FEL_11E12_VL1_K46Q).</p>Pairing of the above VLs with Fel_11E12_VH1 resulted in Feline 11E12 1.1 FW2 and Feline 11E12 1.1 K460 respectively. Changing FW2 resulted in a restoration of affinity for Feline 11E12 1.1 FW2 to the feline IL-31 protein resulting in a KD equivalent to that of the mouse and chimeric form (FIG. 2, Sections A and B). These changes however had a detrimental effect on Feline 11 E12 1.1 FW2s affinity to the canine IL-31 protein indicating a clear distinction in the nature of antibody 11E12s ability to bind this epitope on the feline and canine cytokine. The single amino acid substitution in Feline 11E12 1.1K460 was unable to influence affinity of this antibody. Increased affinity of antibody 11 E12 1.1 FW2 for the feline IL-31 protein resulted in increased potency against the feline cytokine in the canine DH82 assay (FIG. 3).</p>Felinization efforts with mouse antibody 15H05 focused on the combinations of three feline VH frameworks with three feline VL frameworks for a total of 9 felinized mAbs. FEL_15H05_VH1 (SEQ ID NO: 121; FEL_15H05_VH1) the corresponding nucleotide sequence for which is (SEQ ID NO: 122; FEL_15H05_VH1) was combined with (SEQ ID NO: 127; FEL_15H05_VL1) the corresponding nucleotide sequence for which is (SEQ ID NO: 128; FEL_15H05_VL1), (SEQ ID NO: 129; FEL_15H05_VL2) the corresponding nucleotide sequence for which is (SEQ ID NO: 130; FEL_15H05_VL2), and (SEQ ID NO: 131; FEL_15H05_VL3) the corresponding nucleotide sequence for which is (SEQ ID NO: 132; FEL_15H05_VL3) to create Feline 15H05 1.1, Feline 15H05 1.2, and Feline 15H05 1.3 respectively. FEL_15H05_VH2 (SEQ ID NO: 123; FEL_15H05_VH2) the corresponding nucleotide sequence for which is (SEQ ID NO: 124; FEL_15H05_VH2) was combined with (SEQ",
    "e corresponding nucleotide sequence for which is (SEQ ID NO: 174; Feline_HC_AlleleA_1). For ZTS-361, the light chain is (SEQ ID NO: 135; FEL-15H05-VL1_FW2) the corresponding nucleotide sequence for which is (SEQ ID NO: 136; FEL-15H05-VL1_FW2) combined with feline IgG light chain constant (SEQ ID NO: 175; Feline_LC_Kappa_G_minus) the corresponding nucleotide sequence for which is (SEQ ID NO: 176; Feline_LC_Kappa_G_minus).</p>To demonstrate transient production of antibody, each plasmid was used to transfect HEK 293 cells and expression was carried out in various size cultures. Protein was isolated from conditioned HEK medium using Protein A affinity chromatography according to standard protein purification methods. Medium was loaded onto chromatographic resin and eluted by pH shift. Eluted protein was pH adjusted, dialyzed, and sterile filtered prior to use. ZTS-361 was subsequently used for evaluation in the cat pruritus model to evaluate in vivo efficacy. Antibodies produced from a single GS plasmid, ZTS-927 and ZTS-361, were tested for affinity and potency. FIG. 2, Section D shows the results for the affinity assessment of these antibodies using biacore. The affinity of ZTS-927 and ZTS-361 to feline IL-31 is highly consistent with that of the mouse and chimeric form of the progenitor mouse mAb 15H05. The potency of these two antibodies was determined against canine and feline IL-31 using both canine and feline cell assays (FIG. 3). Consistent with previous observations the IC50 values were proportionally higher when using the canine form of IL-31 with both cell types. The IC50 values for ZTS-927 and ZTS-361 against feline IL-31 were also highly consistent with values derived from the chimeric and mouse form of the antibody indicating the final felinized version of mAb 15H05 produced form a single GS plasmid was suitable for cell line development.</p>For generation of a stable cell line producing candidate antibodies, the GS plasmid was linearized prior to transfection with the restriction enzyme, PvuI, which cuts at a single site in the plasmid backbone. GS-CHOK1SV (clone 144E12) cells were transfected with linearized plasmid DNA via electroporation. Following transfection, cells were plated in 48-well plates (48WP) in order to generate stable pools. When pools were at least 50% confluent in the 48 WPs, 100 \u03bcl of supernatant was analyzed for IgG expression using the ForteBio Octet and protein A biosensors (Pall ForteBio, Fremont, Calif.). The best expressing clones were scaled up into 6 well-plates (6 WP) and then into 125 mL shake flasks (SF). Once cells adapted to suspension culture in 125 mL flasks, 2 vials of each cell line pool were banked for LN storage. Since manufacturing cell lines must be clonal, the top 3 highest expressing pools were subcloned by limiting dilution in 96 well culture plates. In order to prove clonality and avoid a second round of limiting dilution, 96 well plates were imaged using Molecular Devices Clone-Select Imager (CSI) (Molecular Devices LLC, San Jose, Calif.) which captures images of single-cells and their sub",
    "wo epitopes (FIG. 6C).</p>1.11. Competition Binding Assessment of mAbs 15H05 and 11E12 Using Biacore</p>To further characterize the IL-31 epitopes bound by mAbs 15H05 and 11 E12, blocking experiments were performed using biacore where the surface containing the IL-31 protein was generated followed by sequential addition of antibodies. FIGS. 7A and 7B show the relative binding of each antibody to IL-31 following capture of 11E12 or 15H05. The columns labeled HBS-EP (assay buffer) indicate the maximum signal obtained from each antibody binding to the IL-31 surface alone without competition. FIG. 7A shows the competition binding data for mouse 15H05 and 11 E12 antibodies to canine IL-31. These results clearly indicate that antibodies 15H05 and 11E12 are capable of binding to canine IL-31 in the presence of one another indicating they recognized distinct epitopes on the protein. The sensograms related to FIG. 7A show the disassociation kinetics of both antibodies are very slow on this newly formed biacore surface therefore no additional occupation of binding sites can occur with addition of the same antibody (data not shown).</p>FIG. 7B shows the competition binding data for antibodies 15H05 and 11E12 on a feline IL-31 surface again showing no overlap in the epitope recognized. Binding of additional antibody in the presence of the same antibody is a result of the increased off rate due to the poorer quality of the surface used. Increased off rates can be seen and compared to the KD values from newly formed feline IL-31 surfaces in FIG. 2.</p>These results further support the epitope mapping data in section 1.10 indicating a distinct epitope is recognized by the CDRs contained in antibody MU-15H05 when compared to MU-11E12. The epitope recognized by antibody 15H05 is distinct from antibody 11E12 described in (U.S. Pat. No. 8,790,651 to Bammert, et al.) and is a novel target on the IL-31 protein for neutralization of this cytokines activity in multiple species. These findings highlight the distinct spatial relationship of binding sites described in the feline IL-31 homology model (FIG. 6B) and support the hypothesis that this face of the cytokine is critical for interaction with the IL-31 Ra:OSMR receptor complex.</p>1.12. Synthesis and Characterization of Soluble Feline IL-31 Co-Receptor (IL-31 RA and OSMR)</p>The human IL-31 heteromeric receptor co-complex, consisting of IL31Ra and OSMR subunits, was shown to be required for IL31-mediated intercellular activation of the JAK-STAT pathway and having involvement in atopic skin disease (Dillon et al. 2004 Nat Immunol. July; 5(7):752-60, Dreuw et al. 2004 J Biol Chem. 279:36112-36120; and Diveu et al. 2004 Eur Cytokine Netw. 15:291-302). The human IL-31Ra subunit was later described as the initial binding event that occurs when IL-31 is in contact with cell surface receptors and this event is a pre-requisite for the recruitment of OSMR with subsequent formation of a high affinity co-receptor complex (Le S",
    "1 with both receptor subunits. Lack of binding could also be due to changes in the confirmation of IL-31 resulting from mutation however these mutants are still capable of binding to antibody which suggests this is not the case. This key finding supports the ability of both antibodies 11E12 and 15H05 (and derivatives) recognizing epitopes on IL-31 that neutralize the cytokines ability to signal through its co-receptor and further block cell association of the cytokine to either receptor during this process. These data support the identification of antibodies that are capable of removing IL-31 from circulation and rendering it unable to bind to cell surface or soluble receptor forms.</p>1.13. In Vivo Evaluation of Chimeric Antibodies in a Feline IL-31 Pruritus Challenge Model</p>The ability of an antibody to effectively neutralize its target can be assessed in vitro through examination of binding to a relevant epitope on the target protein with the appropriate affinity and potency in a cell based assays that allow extrapolation to in vivo potency. Described above are the steps taken to characterize two series of antibodies generated from the mouse progenitor mAbs 11E12 and 15H05. Section 1.7 describes the generation of mouse: feline chimeric forms of mAbs 11E12 and 15H05 with a resulting affinity to canine and feline IL-31 that are comparable to the original mouse monoclonal antibody (FIG. 2, Section A). The mouse: feline chimeric forms of 11 E12 and 15H05 also had comparable IC50 values showing inhibition of feline IL-31 induced pSTAT3 signaling in canine and feline macrophage cells (FIG. 3). During the felinization process in section 1.8, mouse mAb 11 E12 was converted to the felinized version (Feline 11E12 1.1) with subsequent loss of affinity to canine and feline IL-31 (FIG. 3) and loss of potency against feline IL-31 signaling in canine and feline cells (FIG. 3). Prior to optimization of the felinized 11 E12 and 15H05 antibodies described in section 1.8, it was of interest to understand the ability of these preliminary felinized and chimeric forms to neutralize the pruritic activity of feline IL-31 in a cat challenge model. Of interest was the pharmacodynamic effect of these different antibodies on neutralization of pruritus and to understand any correlation to affinity, cellular potency, or epitope recognition that may influence efficacy. Going forward a range of cellular potency that correlates to in vivo efficacy in the pruritus challenge model could be predictive of further optimization necessary using in vitro assays.</p>To test the preliminary efficacy of mouse: feline 11E12 chimera, mouse: feline 15H05 chimera, and felinized 11 E12 (Feline 11E12 1.1), an IL-31 induced pruritus model in cats was developed. Following an intravenous dose of 0.5 \u03bcg/kg feline IL-31 (SEQ ID NO: 159; Feline_IL-31_E_coli), the corresponding nucleotide sequence for which is (SEQ ID NO: 160; Feline_IL-31_E_coli), cats will portray transient pruritic behavior tha",
    " challenge with feline IL-31 was performed up to 1 month prior to dosing with antibody. On day zero, a 0.5 mg/kg antibody dose was combined with 0.5 \u03bcg/kg of feline IL-31 at room temperature for 60 minutes prior to injecting the pre-bound complex into each animal. A \u201cno mAb\u201d control was included for a control. The dose of mAb represents a gross molar excess of antibody to cytokine. Pruritic activity was monitored as described on days 0, 7, and 21. Results in FIG. 9 show significant improvement (p&lt;0.05) in pruritus scores with mAb mouse: feline 15H05 chimera at days 0, 7, and 21 when compared to the placebo control. Although the mouse: feline 11 E12 chimera showed an initial trend in efficacy at day zero, it did not achieve a significant reduction in pruritus at any timepoint when compared to vehicle placebo. Feline 11 E12 1.1 did not reduce pruritus at day zero and showed no trend in efficacy when compared to vehicle placebo so further IL-31 challenges on days 7 and 21 were not performed.</p>Taken together these results show a clear delineation between the activities of these antibodies with the lack of efficacy for feline 11 E1 2 1.1 at preventing pruritic behavior in the cat induced by IL-31. The loss of affinity and potency of feline 11E12 1.1 likely resulted in the lack of in vivo efficacy. When comparing the efficacy outcome of mouse: feline 11E12 chimera and mouse: feline 15H05 chimera the distinction is more subtle. The chimeric forms of both mAbs have a comparable KD value to their mouse progenitor with the affinity of mouse: feline 11E12 being slightly superior to both feline and canine IL-31 (FIG. 2, Section A). This increased affinity however does not translate directly to increased potency as the mouse: feline 15H05 chimera has an approximately 2-fold increased IC50 to that of mouse: feline 11E12 chimera against feline IL-31 induced pSTAT3 signaling in feline FCWF4 cells (FIG. 3). These data suggest that the manner in which antibody 15H05 CDRs recognize feline IL-31 is superior at neutralizing the cytokines ability to signal through its co-receptor in turn making it more effective at blocking pruritus in cats. The differences in IC50s observed in these cellular assays offers a promising means to predict in vivo potency and to discriminate subtle differences in epitope recognition both within and between series of antibodies.</p>1.14. In Vivo Evaluation of the Efficacy of Felinized 15H05 Anti IL-31 Antibodies in a Cat Pruritus Challenge Model</p>Based on the positive efficacy outcome using the mouse: feline 15H05 chimera described above, further work was done to increase the affinity and potency of felinized 15H05 (described above in section 1.8). Systematic substitution of the variable light chain feline frameworks in antibody feline 15H05 1.1 lead to the identification of Feline 15H05 1.1 FW2 having increased affinity to both feline and canine IL-31 compared to mouse 15H05 (FIG. 2). Combination of the heavy and light chains of Feline 15H05 1.1 FW2 into a single plasmid lead to the formation of ZTS-927 and ZTS-361 antibodies following production from HEK and CHO expression systems. The affinity and potency of both antibodies resulting from expression from a single plasmid are also described in FIGS. 2 and 3 respectively.</p>The effi",
    "62 contains the amino acid sequence N-EISVPADTFERKSF-C which corresponds to positions 122 through 135 of SEQ ID NO: 155 with the substitution of Arginine (R) for Cysteine (C) at position number 132. Peptide ZTS-562 also includes N and C terminal Cysteines to facilitate conjugation chemistry using the free thiol groups. Peptide ZTS-563 contains the amino acid sequence N-AKVSMPADNFERKNFILT-C which corresponds to positions 121 through 138 of SEQ ID NO: 157 with the substitution of Threonine (T) for Alanine (A) at position number 138. Peptide ZTS-563 also includes N and C terminal Cysteines to facilitate conjugation chemistry using the free thiol groups. Peptide ZTS-564 contains the amino acid sequence N-TEISVPADTFERKSFILT-C which corresponds to positions 121 through 138 of SEQ ID NO: 155. Peptide ZTS-564 also includes N and C terminal Cysteines to facilitate conjugation chemistry using the free thiol groups. A multistep process using CLIPS technology (Timmerman et al. J Mol Recognit. 2007; 20(5): 283-299) was used to identify and optimize these four peptides capable of binding to the paratope of mAb 15H05 (Pepscan, Lelystad Netherlands). For the purpose of generating immunogens, these four peptides (depicted in FIG. 13A) were independently conjugated to a carrier protein which is an inactive mutant (non-toxic) form of diphtheria toxin (CRM197) using standard cross-linking chemistry. For affinity assessment, each peptide was independently immobilized to a biacore surface and the KD for the felinized anti IL-31 15H05 mAb (ZTS-927) was determined (FIG. 13B). All four peptides bound ZTS-927 with nanomolar affinity indicating they are close representations of the binding site on full length IL-31. To assess the potency of each peptide, a dose titration of conjugated or unconjugated peptides were co-incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 hour with 0.2 \u03bcM (6.5 \u03bcg/ml) of mAb ZTS-361 prior to addition of feline IL-31 on FCWF-4 (feline macrophage-like cells). IC50 values were calculated using increasing concentrations of peptide (x-axis) versus the percent effect (y-axis) defined as the ability of the peptide to bind and block mAb ZTS-361 inhibition of IL-31 protein mediated STAT3 phosphorylation in feline FCWF-4 macrophages. Peptide ZTS-564 had reduced solubility in solution which likely resulted in inefficient conjugation, low epitope density, and poor potency. Peptide ZTS-561 had poor potency in the conjugated form but maintained a good potency when unconjugated (1060-1.7 \u03bcg/ml). ZTS-562 and ZTS-563 both demonstrated excellent potency unconjugated with IC50s of 1.046 \u03bcg/ml and 1.742 \u03bcg/ml respectively. The potency declined approximately 3-fold following conjugation with IC50s for ZTS-562 and ZTS-563 of 3.024 \u03bcg/ml and 3.384 \u03bcg/ml respectively (FIG. 13B). The ability of these peptides to block the high affinity binding of mAb ZTS-361 to the IL-31 protein was highly promising and gave further evidence to support their utility as epitope mimetics (further referred to as IL-31 15H05 mimotopes) of a relevant epitope on IL-31. These IL-31_15H05 mimotopes were further explored for their utility as an immunogens to elicit an anti-IL-31 immune response.</p>2.3. Study Design for Generating Serum Titers to IL-31 Following Immunization of Beagle Dogs with IL-31 15H05 Canine and Feline Mimotopes and Full Length Feline IL-31 Protein</p>An immunogenicity study was undertaken to assess the ability of CRM-197-conjugated IL-31 15H05 mimotopes to",
    "itopes whereby the immune system recognizes them and generates a robust and specific response. Vaccine design is facilitated by, but not limited to, the addition of carrier proteins like CRM-197 and formulation with adjuvants. Described herein are examples of epitopes that have been identified based on the properties of the antibodies they are bound by. Key epitopes are those areas on the IL-31 protein which, when bound by an antibody, are not able to further engage the IL-31 RA: OSMR receptor complex and therefore are not able to elicit a pSTAT signaling response in cell culture or in vivo. Blockade of IL-31 mediated receptor signaling is therefore an approach to prevent and/or treat IL-31 mediated disorders like atopic dermatitis.</p>Mapping of antibody binding sites on proteins using mutational techniques is an effective way to identify key residues involved with antibody: antigen recognition as was previously described for IL-31 in U.S. Pat. No. 8,790,651 to Bammert, et al. Building upon this knowledge enabled the design of canine and feline BC helix mimotopes which are described herein as effective immunogens eliciting robust anti IL-31 responses in dogs and cat. Another method using a GST canine IL-31 fusion protein was described recently to map the anti-canine IL-31 antibody M14 (WO 2018/156367 (Kindred Biosciences, Inc.). These authors sought to define a minimum epitope sequence recognized by the M14 antibody comprised of the amino acids PSDX<sub>1 </sub>X<sub>2</sub>KI (SEQ ID NO 155, amino acids 34-40) where X is any amino acid. Description of this sequence with comparison to homologous IL-31 species can be found in FIG. 19A. A further description, including the flanking sequence surrounding the above, is described FIG. 19B. Following identification of a minimum binding fragment indicated in FIG. 19B (grey shaded box around amino acids 34-42) the authors generated alanine substitutions at each position using a GST fusion of this peptide fragment. From these data, the above M14 minimum binding fragment was described. The fundamental flaw with this approach is that the nature of the described binding fragment is dependent upon its structure in the context of a GST fusion protein. While not being bound to a single theory, it is believed that the amino acid sequence recognized by the M14 antibody is part of an ordered alpha helical domain described herein as helix A. Alpha helices in peptides and proteins exist, but are not limited to, the coordination of hydrogen bonding patterns between the oxygen of carbonyl and nitrogen of amine backbone groups (Corey-Pauling rules, a dictionary of chemistry, 2008). The minimum binding fragment described for the M14 antibody is not believed to represent an adequate description of the epitope as no evidence is given to binding properties in the absence of a GST scaffold. Furthermore, the composition of the sequence surrounding, and including, the reported M14 epitope contains an abundance of nonpolar ami",
    "ein as being suitable to elicit a directed immune response in dogs and cats. The success of vaccine mimotopes depends on the factors described herein and are ultimately determined in vivo by the effectiveness of the response. However, based on the learnings from several epitope regions on IL-31 described here, it is conceived that other such epitopes may exist which would make suitable vaccine mimotopes. Antibody 15H05 recognizes a loop preceding helix D illustrated as site 2 on FIG. 6B. It is conceived that other loops on the protein maybe represent epitopes accessible by antibodies. As an example, the loop formed by the convergence of helix A with the trailing random coil sequence shares such positional and structural attributes as the 15H05 loop. This AB loop is described in FIG. 20 with comparison of the primary amino acid sequences from multiple species. Not wishing to be limited to this as a single example, it is believed that other such regions on the protein may share immunogenic 2.11. Serum titers to equine IL-31 mimotopes following vaccination of mice with full length equine IL-31 protein</p>Mice were immunized with full length equine IL-31 (SEQ ID NO: 165; Equine_IL-31), the corresponding nucleotide sequence for which is (SEQ ID NO: 166; Canine_IL-31) conjugated to CRM-197 like the method described in section 1.6 of this application. Biotin conjugated peptides representing three epitope regions described herein were designed for use with a bio-layer interferometry binding assay (Octet, ForteBio). Description of these peptides are described in FIG. 21A. Each peptide contains an N terminal biotin with a three-amino acid spacer sequence (GSG) annotated with bold underlined text in the figure. The corresponding amino acid sequence position number from SEQ ID NO 165 are also indicated in the figure. The 15H05 mimotope includes two terminal cysteine residues (also highlighted in bold and underlined) to facilitate cyclization by a disulphide bond. FIG. 21B shows the results for a biolayer interferometry where the peptides described in FIG. 21A are immobilized to streptavidin coated pins and then used to probe multiple dilutions of mouse anti equine IL-31 or control mouse serum. Control mouse serum was from a mouse vaccinated with an unrelated protein. The response, described here as the amplitude of the signal following 120 seconds of antiserum association, is represented on the y axis of the figure. From these data, the immune response resulting from presentation of epitopes on the full equine IL-31 protein can be assessed. In addition, the ability of these IL-31 mimotopes to be recognized by those immune responses can be assessed through binding. These data indicate that all three mimotope peptides described (15H05, BC helix, and A helix) are recognized as relevant immunogens from processing and presentation of the equine IL-31 protein in vivo. Minimal signal was observed with binding of the control serum to each mimotope except for the A h"
