    "oline-2 (1H)-yl)-5-chlorine pyrimidine-4-carboxylic acid (123) synthetic.</p>Compound 1B (309mg, 1mmol), 5-chloro-2-methane sulfonyl-pyrimidine-4-carboxylic acid (236mg, 1mmol) and cesium carbonate (975mg, 3mmol) mixture in 2ml DMSO is heated to 60 \u2103 of 6h.Through being added to the water, product is precipitated out from solution, collects through filtering.Roughage is through chromatogram (SiO\n        <sub>2</sub>, contain the carrene of 20% methyl alcohol), provide topic to show compound 123, be white powder: LCMS (purity 96%): m/z 465.9 [M+H].\n      </p>Embodiment 124</p>The compounds of this invention and F-Bak are to Bcl-2 family protein (Bcl-x\n        <sub>L</sub>) measurement of competition of binding site, differentiate fluorescence resonance energy transmission (TR-FRET) service time and combine test:\n      </p>Test compounds is from 50 \u03bc M (2x initial concentrations; 10%DMSO) beginning, serial dilution in DMSO, and shift 10 \u03bc L in 384 orifice plates.In each hole, add 10 \u03bc L albumen/probe/mixtures of antibodies then, final concentration is listed in table 2.</p>Table 2</p></p>Sample mixed 1 minute with oscillator then, at room temperature hatched then other 2 hours.Each test board comprises probe/antibody respectively and albumen/antibody/probe mixture contrasts as negative, positive.Fluorescence is measured with ENVISION (Perkin Elmer), uses 340/35nm sensitization filter disc and 520/525 (F-Bak) and 495/510nm (the anti-his antibody of Tb mark) emission filter disc.Dissociation constant (K\n        <sub>i</sub>) use Wang ' s formula (referring to Wang, Z.X.An exact mathematical expression for describing competitive binding of two different ligands to aprotein molecule.FEBS Lett.1995360:111-114) to measure.TR-FRET test can execution in the presence of the human serum (HS) of variable concentrations or hyclone (FBS).\n      </p>As relatively, use TR-FRET to combine test, The compounds of this invention replaces GST-Bcl-x to the measurement of the competition of other Bcl-2 family protein binding site (for example, Bcl-2, Mcl-1) through the albumen with other GST mark in the TR-FRET test\n        <sub>L</sub>Accomplish, for example, the GST-Bcl-2 of indoor preparation, GST-Mcl-1.\n      </p>The representative compound of setting forth in the his-and-hers watches 1 of the present invention, TR-FRET test result (K\n        <sub>i</sub>, the micromole of unit) order that occurs in table 1 by them below provides: 0.077,0.0002,0.0002,0.0003,0.001,0.0002,0.007,0.00006,0.00007,0.0001,0.0001,0.0003,0.0007,0.006,0.003,0.006,0.004,0.004,0.009,0.003,0.00005,0.019,0.002,0.007,0.0003,0.003,0.001,0.001,0.023,0.0004,0.0001,0.017,0.0003,0.004,0.004,0.005,0.004,0.005,0.0002,0.0004,0.0001,0.002,0.005,0.00007,0.001,0.001,0.0001,0.00005,0.012,0.002,0.0003,0.00005,0.00005,0.00005,0.0006,0.00005,0.00007 (w/1%HS), 0.0005,0.0003,0.176,0.0003,0.13,0.248,0.00005,0.00007,0.0001,0.00005,0.0002,0.0005,0.040,0.174,0.003,0.00008,0.00005,0.00005,0.008,0.007,0.00005,0.0001,0.0"
