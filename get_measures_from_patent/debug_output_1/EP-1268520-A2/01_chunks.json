    "n. Generally, the high affinity ligand can be released using low pH or high salt conditions and the structure identified by sequencing as described herein.</p>\n  In order to determine those ligands that had the highest affinity to the target receptor, generally, over 200 peptide libraries were screened to determine each library's respective inhibition binding. In general, a greater than 10% inhibition at 100 \u03bcM was significant for continued evaluation of the sequence via affinity purification. In additional aspects of the invention, once preferred amino acid residues are identified due to high preference values by CXCR4 at the degenerate positions of the library, specific peptides are synthesized by the same methods as employed for library synthesis. In one embodiment of the invention, a high preference value is greater than 1. The value is determined by subtracting the control value from the sample value and dividing by the reference value. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the preference value is greater than 1.2. In a highly preferred embodiment of the invention, the preference value is greater than 2. After synthesis of the identified peptide sequence, the peptide is purified by, for example, High Performance Liquid Chromatography (\"HPLC\") and compositions are confirmed by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization- Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer (\"MALDI-TOF MS\") and Edman Sequencing. Generally, relative affinities may be measured by modifying the radiolabel binding assay used in receptor purification.</p>\n  To enhance the specificity of the motif obtained from the affinity purified peptides, other methods can be used. The bound components of the libraries can be eluted from the immobilized protein with specific N-terminally blocked peptides or other non-sequencable analogs. To avoid the release of minor contaminants from the affimty resin after binding of the library, the release/elution of the tagged CXCR4 with its bound library can be accomplished \n\nusing specific N-terminally blocked peptides or other non-sequencable analogs. This can be done using acetylated FLAG peptide to elute CXCR4-FLAG receptor from the resin. Alternatively, the tag from CXCR4 may be cleaved using a specific protease (as designed into the protein/vector; either enterokinase or thrombin) after immobilization onto the affinity resin and after the combinatorial library is bound to release the complex. Finally, libraries can be prescreened for their ability to bind to the receptor (using significantly less protein) by a binding assay using CXCR4-containing membranes from, for example, Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperd\u03ac) or High Five (Trichoplusia n\u03ca) cells (both obtained from Invitrogen) in a single assay or in an array assay. This screening may be performed using CXCR4 and a number of linear and cyclic libraries to determine their effectiveness in inhibiting the natural ligand to bind.</p>\n  Methods of the invention further comprise the design of therapeutic agents comprising peptides, peptidomimetics, and/or small molecules that are antagonistic to CXCR4 activity appropriate for the treatment of patients with a disease, such as AIDS. Binding compounds for CXCR4 and the identification of optimal synthesis and purification thereof provides for an effective treatment of AIDS and HIV infection. For example, the small peptide ligand binding compounds of the invention, both cyclic and linear peptide ligands, demonstrate enhanced binding affinity and action, and are resistant to proteolysis as identified, for example, in Table 1. Amino acids and peptides are abbreviated and designated following the rales of the IUPAC-IUB Commission of Biochemical Nomenclature in J Biol. Chem. 247, 977-983 (1972). Amino acid symbols denote the L-configuration unless indicated otherwise.</p>\n  In general, amino acids from the residues of gpl20 that are crucial for viral uptake have been used to specify fixed, or non-degenerate positions in the peptide libraries that have been designed for use in the oriented peptide librar",
    "s when grown in the presence of X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-\u03b2-D-galactoside). These plaques were purified and the isolate was verified by PCR for correctness of recombination using standard techniques. From this, a high-titer stock was generated and infection performed from this stock for expression work using standard techniques. Controls for transfection include cells only and transfer vector. Sf9 or High Five cells were maintained both as adherent and suspension cultures using standard techniques known to those skilled in the art. The adherent cells were grown to confluence and passaged using the sloughing technique at a ratio of 1 :5. Suspension cells were maintained in spinner flasks with 0.1% pluronic F-68 (to minimize shearing) for 2-3 months by sub-culturing to a density of 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml. A time course after infection with recombinant virus was used to define optimal growth conditions for expression using standard techniques. Aliquots of cells from spinner flasks were taken for this time course, centrifuged at 800 x g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C and both supernatant and pellet assayed by SDS-PAGE/Western blot analysis. Figure 2a shows the SDS-PAGE/Western Blots of cell lysate containing CXCR4 and purified CXCR4 stained with coomassie. The CXCR4 was expected to be in the membrane fraction (pellet). All viable systems were assayed in this fashion for levels of expression. The systems with the best expression levels was assayed for activity using a standard binding assay on a membrane preparation using SDF-1 (Chemicon) and [<sup>125</sup>I]-SDF-1 (New England Nuclear, \"NEN\", Boston, MA).</p>\n  The membrane fraction was isolated by first pelleting the whole Sf9 cells (800 x g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C), then resuspending the pellet in a lysis buffer with homogenization. Typical lysis buffer is around neutral pH and contains a cocktail of protease inhibitors, all of which are standard techniques for those skilled in the art. Membranes were pelleted. Solubilization was also conducted using varying NaCl concentrations. Despite conventional thinking, the step of \n\nsolubilization using low salt, for example, low calcium and magnesium concentrations substantially in the absence of NaCl provided unexpected optimal conditions for solubilization when compared for quantity and activity. Having O.OnM NaCl, although counter-intuitive, provided the best conditions when solubilizing and immobilizing candidates with the binding property of CXCR4. The solubilization of the receptor by different detergents (such as, but not limited to, \u03b2-dodecylmaltoside, n-octyl-glucoside, CHAPS, deoxycholate, NP-40, Triton X-100, Tween-20, digitonin, Zwittergents, CYMAL, lauroylsarcosine, etc.) was compared for quantity and activity. A candidate for isolation was carried through for purification as described below. After determining an appropriate detergent for solubilization and activity, such as, for example, Np-40, CXCR4 was purified from the membrane fraction. ",
    "od provides for the identification of motifs of natural amino acids. Phage display technology involves the insertion of DNA sequences into a gene coding for one of the phage coat proteins. The gene is inserted in a particular location so that the expressed protein insert can interact with other molecules. As a result, the encoded peptide or protein sequence will be presented on the surface of the phage and exposed for binding. By inserting degenerate nucleotides, each phage can express a different peptide sequence (\"a phage library\"). Incubation of this phage library with the immobilized receptor can be used to identify sequences which specifically bind to the receptor. Even weak signals can detected because they can be amplified by growing the isolated phage. Information derived from phage display is applicable to affinity purification methods using synthetic libraries containing novel amino acid analogs or cyclic peptides to select ligands that have enhanced pharmaceutical characteristics. The use of initial, secondary and tertiary libraries provided a complete definition of the specificity of the binding site. Once preferred amino acids residues were identified using high preference values by</p>\n  CXCR4 at the degenerate positions of the library, specific peptides were synthesized by methods as employed for library synthesis. Peptides were then purified by HPLC and compositions confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS.</p>\n  Relative affinities were measured by modifying the radiolabel binding assay used in receptor purification. Therefore, the ability of these peptides to displace [<sup>125</sup>I]-SDF-1 from purified CXCR4 membranes was measured.</p>\n  Example 3: Preparation and Analysis of Tagged CXCR4; Screening Using Same</p>\n  A. Cloning and Expression \n\n CXCR4 was isolated from a spleen cDNA library in two halves and spliced together. These two fragments were isolated using PCR technology and primers to the 3' and 5' ends and the middle of the CXCR4 gene. A full-length clone was not isolated with the 3' and 5' primers; however, two halves were isolated and ligated together using a unique BamHl site in the gene. The identity of the constract was confirmed by sequencing. The sequence of the isolate is in Figure 3. An alternate splice shorter form was also isolated, which is called CXCR4s. Tags were added to the C-terminus of the receptor for use in immobilizing them for affinity purification assays using standard techniques. The following are specific examples from experiments using the tagging method. Construction ofCXCR4 with C-Terminal Histidine Tag (Insect Select Expression System)</p>\n  A previous construct containing the gene for GnRHR (gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor) was used to make the first CXCR4 constract. The gene for GnRHR was spliced out and replaced by the isolated cDNA for CXCR4. This vector was originally the pet30a vector with the 6xHis tag at the C-te\u03c0ninus. Construction ofCXCR4 construct with C-terminal FLAG tag: PCR was pe",
    "e compatible with the Gateway technology from Lifetech for ease of manipulation. This was done by ligating into the Smal site the cassette containing the recombination sites required for this technology (from Lifetech). CXCR4 was amplified using PCR with primers to extend the gene to contain the attachment sites for recombination. Then, the PCR product was incorporated into the baculovirus vector using BP clonase (the enzyme required for homologous recombination) to make a vector for baculovirus expression containing CXCR4 with a C-terminal GST tag without the enterokinase or thrombin cleavage sites. This vector was cotransfected into Sf9 cells for preparation of the virus stock necessary for expression. The virus was plaque purified, and a PCR and sequence checked clone was used for expression of CXCR4. A time course with this constract showed that less proteolysis of the protein was observed and less time was necessary to obtain maximal expression of the receptor. B. Activity</p>\n  Each of the tagged CXCR4 genes (CXCR4-FLAG, CXCR4-GST, and CXCR4-HIS) were used to co-transfect Sf9 and High Five cells, as described in Example 1. Whole cells from Sf9 and High five cell lines were lysed using hypotonic buffers (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mM EDTA), and membrane preparations were made by homogenization and centrifugation using standard techniques known to those skilled in the art. Membrane preparations for CXCR4-GST, CXCR4-FLAG, and CXCR4-HIS were assayed using a standard radioligand binding assay. The radioligand [<sup>125</sup>I]-SDF-l\u03b1 was incubated with membranes (0.5 \u03bcg) in binding buffer at 27\u00b0C for \n\n1 hour with and without unlabelled SDF-1. For filtration and washing, the reaction was transferred to Millipore Multiscreen filter plates (HATF 0.45\u03bcm; pre-blocked with 10% BSA), filtered using vacuum, washed 4-5 times with 200 \u03bcL ice-cold buffer, and radioactive counts bound were detected using scintillation counting. All points were done in triplicate. Uninfected cells were used as a control for this experiment. To determine the K<sub>D</sub>, saturation binding was measured using increasing concentrations of [ I]-SDF-l\u03b1 (from 0.5 nM to 10 nM). Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 400 nM unlabelled SDF-1 \u03b1. Competitive binding assays were performed by incubating CXCR4-containing membranes with 0.5 nM [<sup>125</sup>I]- SDF-l\u03b1 and serial dilutions of unlabelled SDF-1 \u03b1 or peptide ligand. Analyses of K<sub>D</sub> and IC<sub>50</sub> were performed using non-linear curve fitting in Kaleidagraph. Figure 7 generally shows charts exemplifying radioligand binding studies using membrane preparations of GST-CXCR4 (High Five). Saturation binding demonstrated a K<sub>D</sub> of 3.27 nM as seen in Figure 7a. Competitive binding assays yielded an IC<sub>5</sub>0 of 12.5 nM and a Hill coefficient of 0.93 as seen by the displacement curves in Figure 7b. The assays analyzed for the charts in Figure 7 were performed by methods provided herein, and wer",
    "ximately equal coupling of amino acids was obtained by adjusting the amounts of amino acids empirically after considering literature values. See. e.g., Ivanetich et. al, Combinatorial Chemistry, vol 267, Academic Press, San Diego, CA USA, p 247-260 (1996). The coupling reagent was HBTU/HOBT/DIEA, 1 equivalent per equivalent of peptide. Cleavage was effected by a cocktail (82% TFA, 5% phenol, 5% thioanisol, 2.5% 1,2- ethanedithiol, 5% water). Peptides were precipitated from methyl tertiary butyl ether. Libraries were characterized by MALDI-TOF MS (Louisiana State University) and by amino acid sequencing. The initial libraries used a single, non-degenerate basic amino acid (i.e., M-X-X-X-X-</p>\n  W-X-X-X-X-A-K-K-K). Through the use of these initial libraries, the optimal residues at some or all degenerate positions became defined. Secondary libraries were made if not all of the positions were defined, fixing the defined positions.</p>\n  F. Screening of Peptide Libraries Using Immobilized CXCR4 With active, large quantities of protein (1 nmol) immobilized to the specific resin (for example, CXCR4-GST to glutathione-sepharose), screening of billions of compound can take place by incubating them together and allowing the natural preferences and binding affinities to \n\npurify the ligands which are preferred by CXCR4. These experiments have been performed with eleven libraries and may be performed with other libraries.</p>\n  To identify which peptide libraries to screen, a membrane binding assay was developed to use with the peptide libraries. Each peptide library (100 \u03bcM final concentration, average molecular weight) was incubated with the receptor (in membranes) and the ability of the peptides in the library to inhibit [ I]-SDFl binding was determined. Figure 10 is a chart showing the high-throughput ligand-binding inhibition for CXCR4. CXCR4-containing membranes were incubated in the presence of 100 \u03bcM library and radiolabeled SDF-1. Percent inhibition was calculated to determine the effect of each library. Peptide libraries with the highest percent inhibition were assayed first.</p>\n  Approximately 500 mL of 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> cell/mL of High Five cells expressing CXCR4-GST were used per affinity purification. Immobilized CXCR4-GST (as described herein) was incubated with 1 mg of the peptide library CPI-10064 (M-A-X-X-X-X-W-X-X-X-X-A-K-K-K) for 20 minutes at room temperature. Unbound peptides were removed by washing. Bound peptides were eluted with 30% acetic acid. Eluted peptide was filtered using a Centricon-10 to remove any protein that might have co-eluted with acetic acid. The filtrate was dried under vacuum, dissolved in water and subjected to peptide sequencing.</p>\n  The sequence for the consensus motif for the specific ligand was identified from this screening to be M-A-R-S-L-I-W-R-P-A-K-A-K-K-K. The affinity for the receptor was determined using standard radioligand displacement methodology as performed by those skilled in the art. This li"
