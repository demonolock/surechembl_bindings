    "ng day the cells were split at various dilutions, and selection media containing 1 \u03bcM methotrexate was added. After approximately two weeks, discrete, methotrexate-resistant colonies were visible. Resistant colonies were either pooled or maintained as distinct \n\nclones. Spent media from the pooled colonies was immediately tested for presence of soluble MPL receptor protein.</p>\n  Soluble MPL receptor protein was isolated through the interaction of the poly-histidine tract present on the carboxy-terminal of the protein with a metal chelation resin containing immobilized Ni <sup>+</sup> (HIS- BIND\u2122; Novagen, Madison, WI) . Serum-free spent culture media from the pLDmpl-53 pool was passed over the resin, and bound protein was eluted with 1 M imidazole. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed a single band at -67 kDa. This protein was subjected to N-terminal amino acid analysis and confirmed to be mouse MPL receptor.</p>\n  Soluble mouse MPL receptor was purified from a pool of BHK transfectants, which had been transfected with the soluble mouse Type I MPL receptor expressing plasmid pLDmpl-53. The purified soluble receptor was immobilized on CNBr-activated SEPHAROSE\u2122 4B (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, Inc.) matrix essentially as directed by the manufacturer and used for affinity purification of the MPL activity in conditioned media of 24-11-5 cells. The affinity matrix was packed in a XK16 column (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc.). Conditioned media from 24-11-5 cells were concentrated on a 10 Kd cut off hollow fiber membrane (A/G Technology Corp. , Needham, MA) and loaded onto the bottom of the MPL receptor affinity column at a flow rate of 1 ml/minute. The column was washed with phosphate buffed saline (PBS) containing 0.5 M NaCl and 0.01% sodium azide. MPL activity was eluted from the column with 3M potassium thiocyanate (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/minute. Potassium thiocyanate was removed by dialysis against PBS. Active fractions were identified by MTT proliferation assay (disclosed in Example VII) . \n\nExample V. Isolation and Characterization of a MPL</p>\n  Receptor Ligand Expressing Cell Line</p>\n  BaF3/MPLRl.l cells are IL-3 dependent cells expressing a stably transfected Type I mouse MPL receptor. A mutagenesis and selection scheme was devised to isolate cell lines expressing the MPL receptor ligand by mutagenizing BaF3/MPLRl.l cells, and selecting for autocrine growth in the absence of exogenous IL-3.</p>\n  Approximately 1.2 x 10<sup>6</sup> BaF3/MPLRl.l cells were pelleted and washed with GM (RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 2-mercaptoethanol (1:240,000 final concentration), 2 mM L-glutamine, 110 \u03bcg/ml sodium pyruvate, 50 \u03bcg/ml G418 and 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum) . The cells were resuspended in 2 ml of GM containing 0.15% (v/v) of the mutagen 2-ethylmethanesulfonate (EMS) and incubated for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C. After incubation, the cells were washed once in PBS and once in GM and plated onto 10 cm plates at ",
    "leated cells were counted and plated in semi-solid medium as described above. The cells were used to test megakaryocyte colony forming activity of the protein encoded by the pZGmpl-1081 insert.</p>\n  A pool of BHK 570 cells stably transfected with pZGmpl-1081 was cultured in the absence of serum, and conditioned medium was collected. The conditioned medium was tested alone and in combination with pokeweed mitogen spleen conditioned medium, recombinant mouse IL-3, IL-6 (Genzyme Corp., Cambridge, MA), IL-11 (Genzyme Corp.) or combinations of these factors. PWMSCM was used as a positive control. Non-conditioned culture medium was used as a negative control.</p>\n  Test or control samples were added to the marrow cultures to bring the total volume to 1 ml. The plates were incubated for six days at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, then examined microscopically for counts of megakaryocyte colonies. Results are shown in Table 4. To summarize, the BHK/pZGmpl-1081 conditioned medium exhibited megakaryocyte colony forming activity, which was enhanced in the presence of early-acting factors to levels notably higher than any of the early-acting factors alone.</p>\n  \n Table 4 continued</p>\n  IL-11 1</p>\n  IL-11 + BHK/pZGmpl-1081 6</p>\n  IL-3 + IL-6 2 IL-3 + IL-6 + BHK/pZGmpl-1081 9</p>\n  IL-3 + IL-11 5</p>\n  IL-3 + IL-11 + BHK/pZGmpl-1081 15</p>\n  In vivo activity of the BHK/pZGmpl-1081 conditioned medium was assayed in mice. Serum-free medium was collected and concentrated five-fold using a 10 Kd cutoff filtration device (A icon, Inc. , Beverly, MA) .</p>\n  Control (non-conditioned) medium was concentrated in a like manner. Six BALB/c mice (Simonsen Laboratories, Inc. , Gilroy, CA) were treated with seven daily intraperitoneal injections of 0.5 ml of either the control or conditioned medium. Blood samples were collected on days 0, 3, and 7 and counted for platelet content.</p>\n  Results, shown in Table 5, demonstrate that the conditioned medium from BHK/pZGmpl-1081 cells has thrombopoietic activity.</p>\n  \n    \n  </p>\n  Example IX. Isolation of Human Thrombopoietin Gene An amplified human lung Lambda FIX\u00ae genomic library (Stratagene Cloning Systems) was screened for the \n\ngene encoding human thrombopoietin using the mouse mpl receptor ligand cDNA as a probe. The library was titered, and 30 150-mm plates inoculated with E. coli strain LE-392 cells (Stratagene Cloning Systems) were infected with 4 x 10<sup>4</sup> plaque forming units (PFU) . The plates were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. Filter plaque lifts were made using HYBOND-N\u2122 nylon membranes (Amersham) according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. The filters were processed by denaturation in a solution containing 1.5 M NaCl and 0.5 M NaOH for 7 minutes at room temperature. The filters were blotted briefly on filter paper to remove excess denaturation solution followed by neutralization for 5 minutes in 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1.5 M NaCl. Phage DNA was fixed onto the filters with 1,200 \u03bcJoules o",
    "</p>\n  After the overnight incubation the spent media were collected and concentrated 15 times using a Centriprep-10\u2122 concentrator (Amicon, Inc.). The resulting 0.7 ml of concentrated supernatant was mixed with 40 \u03bcl of poly-histidine tailed soluble MPL receptor which had been linked to CNBr-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) as directed by the supplier. The mixture was incubated for two hours on ice, while shaking. \n\n The cells were washed once with PBS, then lysed with 1 ml of RIP A buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 5 mM EDTA, 0.15 M</p>\n  NaCl) . The lysate was centrifuged to remove insoluble material, and 40 \u03bcl of MPL-Sepharose was added as above.</p>\n  The MPL-Sepharose was then pelleted by low speed centrifugation, and the spent media and cell lysate supernatants were removed. The pellet was washed four times with PBS containing 0.5 M NaCl. After the final wash, the PBS was removed, and 40 \u03bcl of 2X sample buffer (10% glycerol, 4% SDS, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.05% bromophenol blue) containing 4% beta-mercaptoethanol was added.</p>\n  The samples were boiled for five minutes, and 18 \u03bcl of each was loaded onto a 10-20% gradient mini-gel (Integrated Separation Systems) , then electrophoresed at 100V for approximately two hours. The gel was fixed for thirty minutes (in 40% methanol, 16% glacial acetic acid in distilled water) , then soaked in Amplify\u2122 (Amersham) for twenty minutes. After drying, the gel was exposed to film overnight. A -70 kD band was highly visible in the lane corresponding to spent media from cells transfected with TPO cDNA. This band was not present in spent media from BHK cells or is cell lysates from either cell line.
