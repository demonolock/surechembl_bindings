    "e linker. In some embodiments, a cysteine linker can be used to facilitate conjugation of an integrin targeting ligand to an RNAi agent. Before or after annealing, 5 'or 3' tridentate alkyne-Cys (Stbu) -PEG<sub>2</sub>The functionalized sense strand is functionalized with a maleimide-containing moiety, or can be reduced and left as a free thiol, as shown in the following structure:</p></p>the following example describes the modification of trialkyne-Cys (Stbu) -PEG with N-ethylmaleimide<sub>2</sub>-a duplex: mixing trisynone-Cys (Stbu) -PEG<sub>2</sub>Duplexes (35mg) dissolved in 500. mu.L of deionized H<sub>2</sub>And (4) in O. HEPES buffer (1M, pH8.5, 82. mu.L) was added to the reaction, andthe solution was vortexed. 1M dithiothreitol solution (DTT, 100 equiv., 236. mu.L) was added and the solution was placed on a vortex shaker for 3 hours. After confirming disulfide reduction by denaturing RP-HPLC, the conjugate was precipitated three times in a solvent system of 1x phosphate buffered saline/acetonitrile (1: 14 ratio). The precipitated particles were reconstituted in 0.5mL of 0.1M HEPES (pH6.5) and N-ethylmaleimide (3mg, 10 equivalents) was added to the solution and placed on a vortex mixer for-15 minutes. After completion of the reaction, the conjugate was precipitated three times in a solvent system of 1x phosphate buffered saline/acetonitrile (1: 14 ratio), desalted, and dried.</p>Example 3 binding Activity of integrin targeting ligands</p>As reported in table 1 below, IC50 binding data were obtained for integrin targeting ligands of structures 1c, 2c and 3c, as well as RGD-mimetic peptides:</p>TABLE 1 IC50 binding Activity</p></p>As shown in table 1 above, structures 1,2 and 3 each show efficient binding to \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 integrin and \u03b1 v \u03b2 5 integrin, with structures 2 and 3, for example, showing a particular preference for binding to \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 integrin (IC 50 \u2550 0.3nM and 0.8nM, respectively). Furthermore, structures 1,2 and 3 each show slightly increased binding activity to \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 integrin compared to RGD-mimetic peptides (see, e.g., the RGD-mimetic ligand structure disclosed in U.S. patent No. 9,487,556). Furthermore, although RGD-mimetic ligands are shown to have binding activity, the integrin targeting ligands of the present disclosure have increased stability compared to the peptide-based RGD-mimetic ligands in both serum stability in vivo and chemical stability ex vivo.</p>Example 4 mouse model carrying renal tumor (orthotopic xenograft)</p>Production of SEAP-expressing clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) A498 cells</p>pCR3.1 expression vectors expressing the reporter secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) under the CMV promoter were prepared by directed cloning of the SEAP coding sequence PCR amplified from Clontech's pSEAP 2-basic vector. Convenient restriction sites were added to the primers used to amplify the SEAP coding sequence for cloning into the pcrr 3.1 vector (Invitrogen). The resulting construct pCR3-SEAP was used to generate a SEAP-expressing A498 ccRCC cell line. Briefly, pCR3-SEAP plasmids were transfected into a498 ccRCC cells by electroporation according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Stable transfectants were selected by G418 resistance. Selected A498-SEAP clones were evaluated for SEAP expression and integration stability.</p>Implantation of SEAP-expressing clear cell renal cell carcinoma "
