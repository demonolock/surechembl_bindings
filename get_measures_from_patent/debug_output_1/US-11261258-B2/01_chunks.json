    "inding fragment\u201d) or antigen binding portion thereof refers to one or more sequences of an Ab (full length or fragment of the full length antibody) that retain the ability to bind specifically to the antigen bound by the whole Ab. Examples of an antigen-binding fragment include Fab, F(ab\u2032)<sub>2</sub>, scFv (single-chain variable fragment), Fab\u2032, dsFv, sc(Fv)2, and scFv-Fc.</p>A \u201chumanized\u201d antibody refers to an Ab in which some, most or all of the amino acids outside the CDR domains of a non-human Ab are replaced with corresponding amino acids derived from human immunoglobulins. In one embodiment of a humanized form of an Ab, some, most or all of the amino acids outside the CDR domains have been replaced with amino acids from human immunoglobulins, whereas some, most or all amino acids within one or more CDR regions are unchanged. Small additions, deletions, insertions, substitutions or modifications of amino acids are permissible as long as they do not abrogate the ability of the Ab to bind to a particular antigen. A \u201chumanized\u201d Ab retains an antigenic specificity similar to that of the original Ab.</p>A \u201cchimeric antibody\u201d refers to an Ab in which the variable regions are derived from one species and the constant regions are derived from another species, such as an Ab in which the variable regions are derived from a mouse Ab and the constant regions are derived from a human Ab.</p>As used herein, \u201cspecific binding\u201d refers to the binding of an antigen by an antibody with a dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) of about 1 \u03bcM or lower as measured, for example, by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Suitable assay systems include the BIAcore\u2122 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Marlborough, Mass.) surface plasmon resonance system and BIAcore\u2122 kinetic evaluation software (e.g., version 2.1).</p>Binding of the present antibodies to CD40 antagonizes at least one CD40 activity. \u201cCD40 activities\u201d include, but are not limited to, T cell activation (e.g., induction of T cell proliferation or cytokine secretion), macrophage activation (e.g., the induction of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide in the macrophage), and B cell activation (e.g., B cell proliferation, antibody isotype switching, or differentiation to plasma cells). CD40 activities can be mediated by interaction with other molecules. \u201cCD40 activities\u201d include the functional interaction between CD40 and the following molecules, which are identified by their Uniprot Accession Number is parentheses:</p>CALR(P27797);ERP44(Q9BS26);FBL(P22087);POLR2H(P52434);RFC5(P40937);SGK1(O00141);SLC30A7(Q8NEW0);SLC39A7(Q92504);TRAF2(Q5T1L5);TRAF3(Q13114);TRAF6(Q9Y4K3);TXN(Q5T937);UGGT1(Q9NYU2); andUSP15(Q9Y4E8).</p>For example, a CD40 \u201cactivity\u201d includes an interaction with TRAF2. CD40/TRAF2 interaction activates NF-\u03baB and JNK. See Davies et al., Mol. Cell Biol. 25: 9806-19 (2005). This CD40 activity thus can be determined by CD40-dependent cellular NF-\u03baB and JNK activation, relative to a reference.</p>As used herei",

In contrast, humanized Y12XX antibodies exhibited only a &lt;10 fold shift in the potency for inhibition of cell surface CD40L stimulation, providing more robust blockade of B cell responses to CD40L.</p>Humanized Y12XX antibodies were formatted with IgG1-P238K isotype (CH1-IgG1-P238K; SEQ ID NO: 25) to reduce the binding affinity for Fc\u03b3Rs and reduce Fc\u03b3R-mediated signaling. Fc\u03b3R binding for a representative humanized Y12XX antibody with this IgG1-P238K isotype (Y12XX-hz28-IgG1-P238K) was compared to the binding of a control antibody formatted with a wild type IgG1 isotype (control-IgG1) as well as Antibody B which has an IgG1 isotype containing the mutations L234A-L235A. These L234A-L235A mutations are also introduced to reduce Fc\u03b3R binding.</p>Fc\u03b3R binding SPR studies were performed by capturing antibodies on a protein A sensor chip surface and binding purified His-tagged human Fc\u03b3Rs as analyte. hCD64 binding consisted of a titration of 10 \u03bcM-1.5 nM hCD64 (2:1 dilution series), while data for the low affinity Fc\u03b3Rs hCD32a-H131, hCD32a-R131, hCD32b, hCD16a-V158, and hCD16a-F158 consisted of a titration of 10 uM-13.7 nM Fc\u03b3R protein.</p>The control-IgG1 antibody demonstrated binding to all of the Fc\u03b3Rs tested. See FIG. 1A. Compared to wild type, the Y12XX-hz28-IgG1-P238K antibody demonstrated 125-fold weaker binding to hCD64, and demonstrated no detectable binding to any of the low affinity Fc\u03b3Rs hCD32a-H131, hCD32a-R131, hCD32b, hCD16a-V158 and hCD16a-F158 tested. See FIG. 1B. Antibody B also demonstrated weaker hCD64 binding than wild type IgG1, but also demonstrated appreciable binding to hCD16a-V158 (KD=7 \u03bcM) and some weak binding to hCD32a-H131 and hCD32a-R131. See FIG. 1C. The KD values are provided in FIG. 1D.</p>Humanized versions of the antibody Y12XX with P238K mutation in the Fc region were further tested for any agonist activity. Monocyte derived immature dendritic cells (iDC) are very sensitive to CD40 activation, increasing cytokine production (IL-6) and upregulating surface markers of activation (CD86 and CD54) upon CD40 stimulation. Therefore, the most promising humanized Y12XX antibodies were tested to assess their ability to stimulate iDC. The ability of CD40 antibodies to agonize CD40 can be enhanced by clustering or cross-linking binding of the Fc portions of the molecule to cell surface Fc\u03b3R. Addition of CHO cells highly over-expressing CD32a, the low affinity Fc\u03b3R, were used to evaluate the potential for Fc\u03b3R mediated clustering/cross-link. The ratio of CHO cells to iDCs was 1:6 in these experiments, representing a potentially exaggerated level of clustering/cross-linking. BMS-986090 and 2141 were used as positive controls. BMS-986090 is an anti-CD40 antagonist domain antibody fused to IgG4 Fc (see SEQ ID NO: 1287 in WO 2012/145673). 2141 (mAb 134-2141) is a partial CD40 agonist (see Robert Vonderheide et al., 2007, J. Clin. Oncol. 25(7): 876-883). L6-IgG4 is a fusion protein with no CD40 binding capability, and served as a negative control.</p>As illustrated by the data in FIGS. 2A-2C, the addition of either the partial agonist 2141 or BMS-986090 led to only weak activation of iDC in a subset of donors. However, addition of CD32a-e",
    "IAcore\u2122 surface plasmon resonance (SPR). One method tests the binding of purified His-tagged Fc\u03b3R proteins (Fc\u03b3R-his) to antibodies that are captured on a sensor surface containing protein A which has been immobilized using standard ethyl(dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC)/N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) chemistry with ethanolamine blocking. These experiments are performed on a BIAcore\u2122 T200 instrument (GE Healthcare, Marlborough, Mass.) at 25\u00b0 C. For example, samples of purified antibody at 3 \u03bcg/ml concentration are first captured on the immobilized protein A surface using a 15 second (s) contact time at 10 \u03bcl/min flow rate. This is followed by the binding of purified Fc\u03b3R-His proteins at various concentrations, such as 10 \u03bcM-1.5 nM (2:1 dilution series) or 10 \u03bcM-13.7 nM (2:1 dilution series), using 120 s association and dissociation times at a flow rate of 30\u03bc/min. All steps are performed in a running buffer consisting of 10 mM NaPO<sub>4</sub>, 130 mM NaCl, 0.05% p20 (PBS-T) pH 7.1. Fc\u03b3R proteins tested in these studies include the \u201chigh affinity\u201d Fc\u03b3R CD64 (hFc\u03b3RI), as well as the \u201clow affinity\u201d Fc\u03b3Rs CD32a-H131 (Fc\u03b3RIIa-H131), CD32a-R131 (Fc\u03b3RIIa-R131), CD32b (Fc\u03b3RIIb), CD16a-V158 (Fc\u03b3RIIIa-V158), and CD16a-F158 (Fc\u03b3RIIIa-F158), which were expressed and purified in house. SPR data are fit to either a 1:1 Langmuir model, or a 1:1 steady state model using BIAcore\u2122 T200 evaluation software to obtain values for the association rate constant (ka), dissociation rate constant (kd) and dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>).</p>To compare binding responses for different Fc\u03b3Rs, SPR data can be analyzed by calculating the maximum binding response as a percentage of the theoretical maximum binding response (% Rmax), using the equation:\n\n% Rmax=(Binding Response Analyte)/[((Mw Analyte)/(Mw Ligand))\u00d7(Response Ligand)\u00d7(analyte:ligand stoichiometry)]\u2003\u2003EQUATION 1:\n\nwhere \u201cAnalyte\u201d is the Fc\u03b3R and \u201cLigand\u201d is the captured antibody. This analysis does not take into account the mass of glycosylation of antibody or Fc\u03b3R, and assumes 100% fractional activity for the captured ligand. Since the Fc\u03b3Rs are glycosylated, the % Rmax values are typically great than 100% under saturating conditions.\n</p>CD40 Binding Kinetics and Affinity:</p>The monovalent CD40 binding affinity of the antibody molecules is measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) on a BIAcore\u2122 T200 instrument (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) at 25\u00b0 C. or 37\u00b0 C. by capturing antibody on an immobilized protein A sensor chip surface, and then binding human-CD40-monomer protein (generated in house) using, for example, an association time of 180 seconds, and dissociation time of 180 seconds or 360 seconds at 30 \u03bcl/min in PBS-T, pH 7.1. SPR data are fit to a 1:1 Langmuir model using BIAcore\u2122 T200 evaluation software to obtain values for the association rate constant (ka), dissociation rate constant (kd) and dissociation constant (KD).</p>Titer Analysis:</p>Titer analysis was performed using Biolayer Interferometry (BLI) on an Octet\u00ae RED instrument (ForteBio, Freemont, Calif.) at 25\u00b0 C. Antibodies are captured from supernatant using protein A sensor tips using association time of 120 seconds and the binding response is measured and compared to a standard curve obtained using a control antibody sample to determine the concentration of antibody in the supernatant.</p>Primary Cell Isolation and Culture:</p>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from heparinized human blood by Ficoll density gradient separation. Monocytes were isolated from PBMC following the Manual EasySep\u2122 protocol (STEMCELL, Vancouver, Canada). One million of isolated monocytes were plated in each well of a 6-well plate in 6 mLs of complete media (RPMI-1640, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin), containing IL-4 (100 ng/ml) and GM-CSF (100 ng/ml) and incubated for 6 days at 37\u00b0 C./5% CO<sub>2</sub>, changing media every other day and replacing it with fresh media containing the same concentration of cytokines. iDCs (immature dendritic cells) were harvested on day 6, washed thoroughly, and re-suspended in complete media</p>Treatment of iDCs with Anti-CD40 Antibodies in the Presence or Absence of Fc\u03b3R Clustering/Crosslinking:</p>Titrations of the various biological agents were made in complete media, and added to duplicate 96-well plates.
