    "domain\" refers to a protein or a portion of a protein (e.g., an antibody determinant) that specifically binds a particular antigen, e.g., the portion of an antigen binding protein that comprises amino acid residues that interact with an antigen and confer on the antigen binding protein its specificity and affinity for the antigen.</p>As used herein, the phrase \"Fc domain\" refers to a fragment crystallizable region or tail region of an antibody. The Fc domain interacts with Fc receptors on the cell surface.</p>As used herein, the phrase \"targeted binding domain\" refers to a protein or a portion of a protein that specifically binds to a second antigen that is different from the antigen to which the antigen binding domain of the immunoconjugate binds. The targeting binding domain may be conjugated to the antibody construct at the C-terminus of the Fc domain. </p>As used herein, the term \"antibody\" refers to a polypeptide comprising an antigen binding region (including Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs)) of an immunoglobulin gene or fragment thereof that specifically binds to and recognizes an antigen. Recognized immunoglobulin genes include k, \u03bb, \u03b1, \u03b3, and \u03bc constant region genes, as well as a number of immunoglobulin variable region genes.</p>An exemplary immunoglobulin (antibody) building block comprises a tetramer. Each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one \"light chain\" (about 25kD) and one \"heavy chain\" (about 50-70 kD). The N-terminus of each chain defines a variable region of about 100-110 or more amino acids, primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The term variable light chain (V)<sub>L</sub>) And a variable heavy chain (V)<sub>H</sub>) These refer to the light and heavy chains, respectively. Light chains are classified as k or \u03bb. Heavy chains are classified as gamma, mu, alpha, or, which in turn define the immunoglobulin classes IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE, respectively.</p>IgG antibodies are large molecules of about 150kDa consisting of four peptide chains. IgG antibodies contain two identical gamma-like heavy chains of about 50kDa and two identical light chains of about 25kDa, forming a tetrameric quaternary structure. The two heavy chains are linked to each other and to each light chain by disulfide bonds. The resulting tetramer has two identical halves which together form a Y-shape. Each end of the fork contains the same antigen binding site. There are four subclasses of IgG in humans (IgG1, 2, 3, and 4), named in order of their abundance in serum (IgG1 is the most abundant). Generally, the antigen binding region of an antibody is most critical in terms of specificity and affinity of binding. </p>The dimeric IgA antibody was about 320 kDa. IgA has two subclasses (IgA1 and IgA2) and can be produced as monomers as well as dimers. IgA dimeric forms (secretory or sIgA) are the most abundant.</p>Antibodies can exist, for example, as intact immunoglobulins or as a number of wel",
    "tive in cancer treatment or tumor size reduction. Accordingly, some embodiments of the invention provide immunoconjugates wherein the antibody is a monoclonal antibody. In some embodiments, the monoclonal antibody is humanized.</p>In some embodiments, the antibody binds to an antigen of a cancer cell. For example, an antibody can bind to at least 10; 100, respectively; 1,000; 10,000; 100,000; 1,000,000; 2.5X 10<sup>6</sup>\uff1b5\u00d710<sup>6</sup>(ii) a Or 1X 10<sup>7</sup>The target antigen is present on the surface of the cancer cell in an amount of one or more copies.</p>In some embodiments, the antibody binds to an antigen on a cancer or immune cell with higher affinity than the corresponding antigen on a non-cancer cell. For example, an antibody can preferentially recognize an antigen containing a polymorphism found on a cancer cell or an immune cell as compared to a corresponding wild-type antigen on a non-cancer cell or a non-immune cell. In some cases, the antibody binds to the cancer cell or immune cell with greater affinity than to the non-cancer cell or non-immune cell. For example, cancer cells or immune cells may express a higher density of antigen, thereby providing higher affinity binding of multivalent antibodies to cancer cells or immune cells. </p>In some cases, an antibody does not significantly bind a non-cancer antigen (e.g., the antibody binds one or more non-cancer antigens with at least 10; 100; 1,000; 10,000; 100,000; or 1,000,000 fold lower affinity (higher Kd) than the target cancer antigen. in some cases, the target cancer antigen to which the antibody binds is enriched on the cancer cells. for example, the target cancer antigen can be present on the surface of the cancer cells at a level at least 2, 5, 10; 100; 1,000; 10,000; 100,000; or 1,000,000 fold higher than the corresponding non-cancer cells. The target antigen may be expressed by other cells). Thus, in the phrase \"an antibody that specifically binds to a cancer cell antigen,\" the term \"specificity\" refers to the specificity of the antibody, and not to the uniqueness of the antigen in that particular cell type. </p>In some embodiments, the antibodies in the immunoconjugate comprise a modified Fc region, wherein the modification modulates binding of the Fc region to one or more Fc receptors.</p>In some embodiments, the antibodies contain one or more modifications (e.g., amino acid insertions, deletions, and/or substitutions) in the Fc region that result in modulated binding (e.g., increased binding or decreased binding) to one or more Fc receptors (e.g., fcyri (CD64), fcyriia (CD32a), fcyriib (CD32b), fcyriiia (CD16a), and/or fcyriiib (CD16b)) as compared to a native antibody lacking the mutations of the Fc region. In some embodiments, the antibody contains one or more modifications (e.g., amino acid insertions, deletions, and/or substitutions) in the Fc region that reduce binding of the Fc region of the antibody to fcyriib. In some embodiments, the antibody contains on",
