In certain embodiments, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof comprises the HCVR and the LCVR encoded by nucleotide sequence segments derived from a germline gene combination selected from the group consisting of: (i) V<sub>H</sub>3-23, D<sub>H</sub>2-21, J<sub>H</sub>4, V<sub>K</sub>1-5 and J<sub>K</sub>1; (ii) V<sub>H</sub>3-7, D<sub>H</sub>1-7, J<sub>H</sub>6, V<sub>K</sub>4-1 and J<sub>K</sub>3; (iii) V<sub>H</sub>3-23, D<sub>H</sub>2-2, J<sub>H</sub>6, V<sub>K</sub>1-9 and J<sub>K</sub>2; (iv) V<sub>H</sub>3-23, D<sub>H</sub>6-6, K<sub>H</sub>4 V<sub>K</sub>1-9 and J<sub>K</sub>4; (v) V<sub>H</sub>1-2, D<sub>H</sub>2-15, J<sub>H</sub>3, V<sub>K</sub>1-12 and J<sub>K</sub>4; (vi) V<sub>H</sub>4-34, D<sub>H</sub>3-9, J<sub>H</sub>4, V<sub>K</sub>3-20 and J<sub>K</sub>4; (vii) V<sub>H</sub>4-34, D<sub>H</sub>1-1, J<sub>H</sub>4, V<sub>K</sub>3-20 and J<sub>K</sub>4; and (viii) V<sub>H</sub>4-34, D<sub>H</sub>3-3, J<sub>H</sub>4, V<sub>K</sub>2-24 and J<sub>K</sub>4.</p>In a sixth aspect, the invention features an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof that specifically binds to hTL1A or Fhm with an equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of about 1 nM or less, as measured by surface plasmon resonance assay (for example, BIACORE\u2122). In certain embodiments, the antibody of the invention exhibits a K<sub>D </sub>of about 800 pM or less; about 700 pM or less; about 600 pM or less; about 500 pM or less; about 400 pM or less; about 300 pM or less; about 200 pM or less; about 150 pM or less; about 100 pM or less; about 90 pM or less; about 80 pM or less; about 50 pM or less; or 30 pM or less.</p>In a seventh aspect, the present invention provides an anti-hTL1A antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof that binds hTL1A protein of SEQ ID NO:244, but does not cross-react with a variant thereof, such as Fhm of SEQ ID NO:246, as determined by, for example, ELISA, surface plasmon resonance assay, or Luminex\u00ae xMAP\u00ae Technology, as described herein. Fhm contains a single amino acid substitution at position 167, corresponding to Gln in hTL1A, with Arg (see U.S. Pat. No. 6,521,422). In related embodiments, the invention also provides an anti-hTL1A antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof that binds a hTL1A protein and cross-reacts with an Fhm. In another related embodiment, the invention provides an anti-hTL1A antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof that does not cross-react with mouse TL1A (mTL1A: SEQ ID NO:250, encoded by the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:249) but does cross-react with TL1A of cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis, or MfTL1A: SEQ ID NO:248, encoded by the ",
    " a single polypeptide molecule. Moreover, an antigen-binding fragment of an antibody of the present invention may comprise a homo-dimer or hetero-dimer (or other multimer) of any of the variable and constant domain configurations listed above in non-covalent association with one another and/or with one or more monomeric V<sub>H </sub>or V<sub>L </sub>domain (e.g., by disulfide bond(s)).</p>As with full antibody molecules, antigen-binding fragments may be monospecific or multispecific (e.g., bispecific). A multispecific antigen-binding fragment of an antibody will typically comprise at least two different variable domains, wherein each variable domain is capable of specifically binding to a separate antigen or to a different epitope on the same antigen. Any multispecific antibody format, including the exemplary bispecific antibody formats disclosed herein, may be adapted for use in the context of an antigen-binding fragment of an antibody of the present invention using routine techniques available in the art.</p>In certain embodiments, antibody or antibody fragments of the invention may be conjugated to a therapeutic moiety (\u201cimmunoconjugate\u201d), such as a cytotoxin, a chemotherapeutic drug, an immunosuppressant or a radioisotope.</p>The term \u201cspecifically binds,\u201d or the like, means that an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof forms a complex with an antigen that is relatively stable under physiological conditions. Specific binding can be characterized by an equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of about 3000 nM or less (i.e., a smaller K<sub>D </sub>denotes a tighter binding), about 2000 nM or less, about 1000 nM or less; about 500 nM or less; about 300 nM or less; about 200 nM or less; about 100 nM or less; about 50 nM or less; about 1 nM or less; or about 0.5 nM or less. Methods for determining whether two molecules specifically bind are well known in the art and include, for example, equilibrium dialysis, surface plasmon resonance, and the like. An isolated antibody that specifically binds hTL1A may, however, exhibit cross-reactivity to other antigens, such as TL1A molecules from other species, for example, cynomolgus monkey TL1A (SEQ ID NO:248), and/or mouse TL1A (SEQ ID NO:250), and/or a TL1A variant, such as Fhm (SEQ ID NO:246). Moreover, multi-specific antibodies (e.g., bispecifics) that bind to hTL1A and one or more additional antigens are nonetheless considered antibodies that \u201cspecifically bind\u2019 hTL1A, as used herein.</p>The term \u201chigh affinity\u201d antibody refers to those antibodies having a binding affinity to hTL1A, expressed as K<sub>D</sub>, of about 1\u00d710<sup>\u22129 </sup>M or less, about 0.5\u00d710<sup>\u22129 </sup>M or less, about 0.25\u00d710<sup>\u22129 </sup>M or less, about 1\u00d710<sup>10 </sup>M or less, or about 0.5\u00d710<sup>\u221210 </sup>M or less, as measured by surface plasmon resonance, e.g., BIACORE\u2122 or solution-affinity ELISA.</p>The term \u201cK<sub>D</sub>\u201d, as used herein, is intended to refer to the equilibrium dissociation constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction.</p>By the term \u201cslow off rate\u201d, \u201cKoff\u201d or \u201ck<sub>d</sub>\u201d is meant an antibody that dissociates from hTL1A with a rate constant of 1\u00d710<sup>\u22123 </sup>s<sup>\u22121 </sup>or less, preferably 1\u00d710<sup>\u22124</sup>s<sup>\u22121 </sup>or less, as determined by surface plasmon resonance, e.g., BIACORE\u2122.</p>By the term \u201cintrinsic affinity constant\u201d or \u201ck<sub>a</sub>\u201d is meant an antibody that associates with hTL1A at a rate constant of about 1\u00d710<sup>3 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>s<sup>\u22121 </sup>or higher, as determined by surface plasmon resonance, e.g., BIACORE\u2122.</p>An \u201cisolated antibody\u201d, as used herein, is intended to refer to an antibody that is substantially free of other mAbs having different antigenic specificities (e.g., an isolated antibody that specifically binds hTL1A is substantially free of Abs that specifically bind antigens other than hTL1A). An isolated antibody that specifically binds hTL1A may, however, have cross-reactivity to other antigens, such as TL1A molecules from other species, such as cynomolgus monkey and mouse, and/or hTL1A variants, such as Fhm.</p>A \u201cneutralizing antibody\u201d, as used herein (or an \u201cantibody that neutralizes TL1A activity\u201d), is intended to refer to an antibody whose binding to TL1A results in inhibition of at least one biological activity of TL1A. This inhibition of the biological activity of TL1A can be assessed by measuring one or more indicators of TL1A biological activity by one or more of",
    "the test antibody may bind to the same epitope as the epitope bound by the reference anti-hTL1A antibody of the invention.</p>To determine if an antibody competes for binding with a reference anti-hTL1A antibody, the above-described binding methodology is performed in two orientations: In a first orientation, the reference antibody is allowed to bind to a hTL1A molecule under saturating conditions followed by assessment of binding of the test antibody to the hTL1A molecule. In a second orientation, the test antibody is allowed to bind to a hTL1A molecule under saturating conditions followed by assessment of binding of the reference antibody to the TL1A molecule. If, in both orientations, only the first (saturating) antibody is capable of binding to the TL1A molecule, then it is concluded that the test antibody and the reference antibody compete for binding to hTL1A. As will be appreciated by a person of ordinary skill in the art, an antibody that competes for binding with a reference antibody may not necessarily bind to the identical epitope as the reference antibody, but may sterically block binding of the reference antibody by binding an overlapping or adjacent epitope.</p>Two antibodies bind to the same or overlapping epitope if each competitively inhibits (blocks) binding of the other to the antigen. That is, a 1-, 5-, 10-, 20- or 100-fold excess of one antibody inhibits binding of the other by at least 50% but preferably 75%, 90% or even 99% as measured in a competitive binding assay (see, e.g., Junghans et al., Cancer Res. 1990:50:1495-1502). Alternatively, two antibodies have the same epitope if essentially all amino acid mutations in the antigen that reduce or eliminate binding of one antibody reduce or eliminate binding of the other. Two antibodies have overlapping epitopes if some amino acid mutations that reduce or eliminate binding of one antibody reduce or eliminate binding of the other.</p>Additional routine experimentation (e.g., peptide mutation and binding analyses) can then be carried out to confirm whether the observed lack of binding of the test antibody is in fact due to binding to the same epitope as the reference antibody or if steric blocking (or another phenomenon) is responsible for the lack of observed binding. Experiments of this sort can be performed using ELISA, RIA, surface plasmon resonance, flow cytometry or any other quantitative or qualitative antibody-binding assay available in the art.</p>ImmunoconjugatesThe invention encompasses a human anti-TL1A monoclonal antibody conjugated to a therapeutic moiety (\u201cimmunoconjugate\u201d), such as a cytotoxin, a chemotherapeutic drug, an immunosuppressant or a radioisotope. Cytotoxin agents include any agent that is detrimental to cells. Examples of suitable cytotoxin agents and chemotherapeutic agents for forming immunoconjugates are known in the art, see for example, WO 05/103081, herein specifically incorporated by reference).</p>BispecificsThe antibodies of the present invention may be monospecific, bispecific, or multispecific. Multispecific mAbs may be specific for different epitopes of one target polypeptide or may contain antigen-binding domains specific for more than one target polypeptide. See, e.g., Tutt et al., 1991, J. Immunol. 147:60-69. The human anti-hTL1A mAbs can be linked to or co-expressed with another functional molecule, e.g., another peptide or protein. For example, an antibody or fragment thereof can be functionally linked (e.g., by chemical coupling, genetic fusion, noncovalent association or otherwise) to one or more other molecular entities, such as another antibody or antibody fragment, to produce a bispecific or a multispecific antibody with a second binding specificity.</p>An exemplary bi-specific antibody format that can be used in the context of the present invention involves the use of a first immunoglobulin (Ig) C<sub>H</sub>3 domain and a second Ig C<sub>",

A positive control antibody (control mAb1) inhibited E. coli-expressed, but not CHO-expressed, hTL1A. Ten antibodies also inhibited stimulation of hDR3-expressing cells by Fhm (hTL1A with Q167R). H4H1681N, H4H1805N and H4H1752P did not fully inhibit Fhm at the highest antibody concentration of 100 nM. All thirteen antibodies also blocked MfTL1A (Table 6). Mouse TL1A (produced from both CHO and E. coli) stimulated NF\u03baB activation in the hDR3 reporter cells; however, none of the 13 anti-human TL1A antibodies inhibited E. coli-expressed mouse TL1A in this assay (Table 6). Nine selected antibodies were further tested and did not demonstrate blocking of CHO-expressed mouse TL1A in this assay (Table 6).</p>To test the ability of TL1A expressed on cells to stimulate signaling in the hDR3 reporter system, bioassays were performed as described above for soluble TL1A with the following changes: Adherent HEK293/TL1A cells were dissociated using Enzyme-Free Dissociation Solution (Chemicon) and added to adherent hDR3 reporter cells after serially diluting the TL1A cells at 1:2 starting from 2\u00d710<sup>5 </sup>cells to 195 cells (plus a no-cell control). For inhibition by antibodies, 1\u00d710<sup>4 </sup>cells were added together with serially diluted antibodies from 100 nM to 0.002 nM (plus a control containing no antibody). The results are shown in Table 7. Control mAb1 and mAb2: Same as the assays above.

With cell-bound Fhm, all antibodies inhibited significantly except H4H1681N, H4H1805N, H4H1750P and H4H1752P, which did not inhibit fully at the highest tested antibody concentration of 100 nM. With cell-bound MfTL1A, all antibodies inhibited, except H4H1750 that did not inhibit completely at the highest tested antibody concentration of 100 nM. Six of the antibodies H4H1704N, H4H1804N, H4H1805N, H4H1817N, H4H1725P, and H4H1742P were tested for blocking cell-surface mTL1A stimulation of mDR3 cells; and none showed inhibition. Reporter cells expressing mouse DR3 could also be stimulated by rTL1A-expressing 293 cells, with an observed EC<sub>50 </sub>of 9773 cells (Table 7). Four antibodies were tested in the rTL1A/mDR3 assay: three antibodies H4H1804N, H4H1817N, H4H1725P blocked while H4H1805N did not block stimulation of mDR3 cells by cell-surface rTL1A (Table 7).

Control mAb1 also did not inhibit stimulation of hDR3-expressing cells by any of the cell-surface expressed TL1A and Fhm under all tested conditions (Table 7).</p>Experiment 5: Blocking of TL1A to hDR3 and DcR3 by Anti-TL1A Antibodies</p>The ability of antibodies to block human TL1A binding to its cognate receptors, the DR3 and DcR3 receptors, was measured using a competition sandwich ELISA. In addition, blocking of a human TL1A variant FHM (human TL1A Q167R) and the cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) TL1A (MfTL1A) protein binding to the human DR3 or DcR3 receptors was measured in the same manner. Constant amounts of biotinylated human TL1A or FHM (both expressed with a 6-His tag in CHO cells) or biotinylated MfTL1A (expressed in CHO cells) were separately titrated with varying amounts of antibodies. The antibody-protein complexes were incubated in solution (1 hr, 25\u00b0 C.) and then transferred to microtiter plates coated with human DR3 (hDR3) or human DcR3 (hDcR3) expressed as human IgG1 Fc fusion proteins. After one hour at 25\u00b0 C. the wells were washed, and bound human or monkey TL1A was detected with streptavidin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Wells were developed with a TMB solution to produce a colorimetric reaction and quenched with aqueous sulfuric acid before reading absorbance at 450 nm on a Perkin-Elmer Victor X5 plate reader. A sigmoidal dose-response curve was fit to the data using the Prism\u2122 data analysis package. The calculated IC50 value, defined as the concentration of antibody required to block 50% of TL1A binding to hDR3 or hDcR3, was used as an indicator of blocking potency. Both fully human anti-hTL1A mAbs and comparator antibodies, i.e., control mAb1 (an anti-hTL1A antibody with heavy and light chain variable domains having the amino acid sequences corresponding to SEQ ID NOS:21 and 27, respectively, of US 2009/0280116) and control mAb3 (an anti-hTL1A antibody with heavy and light chain variable domains having the amino acid sequences corresponding to SEQ ID NOS:57 and 48, respectively, of US 2009/0280116), were included in the study. The results are shown in Table 8. NB: No binding under the conditions tested; NT: Not tested. Concentrations of biotinylated soluble ligands: (1) 150 pM; (2) 500 pM; (3) 10 pM; and (4) 50 pM.</p>As shown in Table 8, most of the fully human mAbs show effective blocking of the TL1A/hDR3 and TL1A/hDcR3 binding interaction, with several showing IC50 values below 50 pM. Two of the antibodies, H4H1752P and H4H1805N, strongly blocked binding of both human and monkey TL1A binding to both hDR3 and hDcR3 but failed to block binding of FHM to either hDR3 or hDcR3, suggesting that the binding epitope for these two antibodies may involve the region near the FHM mutation site (hTL1A with Q167R). The crystal structure of hTL1A shows that residue Q167 occurs within a surface-exposed loop (Zhan et al., 2009, Biochemistry 48: 7636-7645).</p>TABLE 8hDR3hDR3hDR3DcR3DcR3DcR3hTL1A (CHO)<sup>1</sup>FHM (CHO)<sup>1</sup>MfTL1A (CHO)<sup>2</sup>hTL1A (CHO)<sup>3</sup>FHM (CHO)<sup>3</sup>MfTL1A (CHO)<sup>4</sup>mAb IDIC<sub>50 </sub>(pM)IC<sub>50 </sub>(pM)IC<sub>50 </sub>(pM)IC<sub>50 </sub>(pM)IC<sub>50 </sub>(pM)IC<sub>50 </sub>(pM)H4H1681N60&gt;10000141179093H2M1681N37&gt;100006113234149H4H1704N30444277170110H2M1704NNTNTNTNTNTNTH4H1719P222346444561H4H1725P1518166885145H4H1738P6915211712215068H4H1742P64214240181231127H4H1745P1844505885118H4H1750P3415895209656626NBH4H1752P104NB11031NB56H4H1804N406971175&gt;1000034H2M1804N4610281120&gt;100009H4H1805N14NB2633436313H2M1805N6NB131222411138H4H1817N114235101270NT322H2M1817N154249137890666776H4H1818N119202123232NT1102H2M1818N154317239396NB55Control&gt;10000NB5300&gt;1000NT21000mAb1Control&gt;10000NB170008600NTNTmAb3</p>Example 6: Cell Surface Binding Competition of Anti-TUA Antibodies with Soluble hTL1A</p>Human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably transfected to over-express cell-surface hTL1A"
