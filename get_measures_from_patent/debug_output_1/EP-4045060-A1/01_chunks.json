One embodiment of the disclosure provides fully human antibodies capable of binding human transferrin receptor which can be generated using techniques well known in the art, such as, but not limited to, using human Ig phage libraries such as those disclosed in Jermutus et al., PCT publication No. WO 2005/007699 A2. </p>[00060] Region of complementarity: As used herein, the term \u201cregion of complementarity\u201d refers to a nucleotide sequence, e.g., of a oligonucleotide, that is sufficiently complementary to a cognate nucleotide sequence, e.g., of a target nucleic acid, such that the two nucleotide sequences are capable of annealing to one another under physiological conditions (e.g., in a cell). In some embodiments, a region of complementarity is fully complementary to a cognate nucleotide sequence of target nucleic acid. However, in some embodiments, a region of complementarity is partially complementary to a cognate nucleotide sequence of target nucleic acid (e.g., at least 80%, 90%, 95% or 99% complementarity). In some embodiments, a region of complementarity contains 1, 2, 3, or 4 mismatches compared with a cognate nucleotide sequence of a target nucleic acid. </p>[00061] Specifically binds: As used herein, the term \u201cspecifically binds\u201d refers to the ability of a molecule to bind to a binding partner with a degree of affinity or avidity that enables the molecule to be used to distinguish the binding partner from an appropriate control in a binding assay or other binding context. With respect to an antibody, the term,</p>\u201cspecifically binds\u201d, refers to the ability of the antibody to bind to a specific antigen with a degree of affinity or avidity, compared with an appropriate reference antigen or antigens, that enables the antibody to be used to distinguish the specific antigen from others, e.g., to an extent that permits preferential targeting to certain cells, e.g., muscle cells, through binding to the antigen, as described herein. In some embodiments, an antibody specifically binds to a target if the antibody has a KD for binding the target of at least about 10<sup>4</sup> M, 10<sup>5</sup> M, 10<sup>6</sup> M, 10<sup>7</sup> M, 10<sup>8</sup> M, 10<sup>9</sup> M, 10<sup>10</sup> M, 10 <sup>11</sup> M, 10 <sup>12</sup> M, 10 <sup>13</sup> M, or less.

In some embodiments, a subject is non-human primate, or rodent. In some embodiments, a subject is a human. In some embodiments, a subject is a patient, e.g., a human patient that has or is suspected of having a disease. In some embodiments, the subject is a human patient who has or is suspected of having a disease resulting from a disease-associated-repeat expansion, e.g., in a DMPK allele. </p>[00063] Transferrin receptor: As used herein, the term, \u201ctransferrin receptor\u201d (also known as TFRC, CD71, p90, or TFR1) refers to an internalizing cell surface receptor that binds transferrin to facilitate iron uptake by endocytosis. In some embodiments, a transferrin receptor may be of human (NCBI Gene ID 7037), non-human primate (e.g., NCBI Gene ID 711568 or NCBI Gene ID 102136007), or rodent (e.g., NCBI Gene ID 22042) origin. In addition, multiple human transcript variants have been characterized that encoded different isoforms of the receptor (e.g., as annotated under GenBank RefSeq Accession Numbers: </p>NP 001121620.1, NP 0032",

These data further demonstrate that the DTX-C-008 complex is capable of specifically targeting muscle tissues for dose-dependent inhibition of DMPK. </p>Example 5: Targeting DMPK in cynomolgus monkey muscle tissues with a muscletargeting complex \n\n[000304] A muscle-targeting complex comprising DTX-P-060 (DTX-C-012), was generated and purified using methods described in Example 2. DTX-C-012 is a complex comprising a human anti-transferrin antibody covalently linked, via a cathepsin cleavable Val- Cit linker, to DTX-P-060, an antisense oligonucleotide that targets DMPK. Following HIC- HPLC purification, densitometry confirmed that DTX-C-012 had an average ASO to antibody ratio of 1.32, and SDS-PAGE revealed a purity of 92.3%. </p>[000305] DTX-C-012 was tested for dose-dependent inhibition of DMPK in male cynomolgus monkey tissues. Male cynomolgus monkeys (19-31 months; 2-3 kg) were intravenously injected with a single dose of a saline control, DTX-P-060 (naked DMPK ASO) (10 mg/kg of RNA), or DTX-C-012 (10 mg/kg of RNA) on Day 0. Each experimental condition was replicated in three individual male cynomolgus monkeys. On Day 7 after injection, tissue biopsies (including muscle tissues) were collected. DMPK mRNA expression levels, ASO detection assays, serum clinical chemistries, tissue histology, clinical observations, and body weights were analyzed. The monkeys were euthanized on Day 14. [000306] Significant knockdown (KD) of DMPK mRNA expression using DTX-C-012 was observed in soleus, deep flexor, and masseter muscles relative to saline control, with 39% KD, 62% KD, and 41% KD, respectively (FIGs. 7A-7C). Robust knockdown of DMPK mRNA expression DTX-C-012 was further observed in gastrocnemius (62% KD; FIG. 7D), EDL (29% KD; FIG. 7E), tibialis anterior muscle (23% KD; FIG. 7F), diaphragm (54% KD; FIG. 7G), tongue (43% KD; FIG. 7H), heart muscle (36% KD; FIG. 71), quadriceps (58% KD; FIG. 7 J), bicep (51% KD; FIG. 7K), and deltoid muscles (47% KD; FIG. 7F). Knockdown of DMPK mRNA expression DTX-C-012 in smooth muscle was also observed in the intestine, with 63% KD at jejunum-duodenum ends (FIG. 8A) and 70% KD in ileum (FIG. 8B). </p>Notably, naked DMPK ASO ( i.e not linked to a muscle-targeting agent), DTX-P-060, had minimal effects on DMPK expression levels relative to the vehicle control (i.e., little or no reduction in DMPK expression) for all assayed muscle tissue types. Monkeys treated with the DTX-C-012 complex demonstrated no change in DMPK expression in non-muscle tissues, such as liver, kidney, brain, and spleen tissues (FIGs. 9A-9D). Additional tissues were examined, as depicted in FIG. 10, which shows normalized DMPK mRNA tissue expression levels across several tissue types in cynomolgus monkeys. (N=3 male cynomolgus monkeys) [000307] Prior to euthanization, all monkeys were tested for reticulocyte levels, platelet levels, hemoglobin expression, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) expression, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) expression, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels on days 2, 7, and 14 after dosing. As shown in FIG. 12, monkeys dosed with antibody-oligonucleotide complex \n\nhad normal reticulocyte levels, platelet levels, hemoglobin expression, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) expression, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) expression, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels throughout the length of the experiment. These data show that a single dose of a complex comprising DTX-P-060 is safe and tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys. [000308] These data demonstrate that the anti-transferrin receptor antibody of the DTX- C-012 complex enabled cellular internalization of the comple",

DM1 C15 myoblasts were prepared as in Example 7 to yield differentiated myotubes in 96-well microplates. After seven days of differentiation, cells were transfected with individual oligonucleotides using Lipofectamine MessengerMax. Each oligonucleotide was tested in triplicate at concentrations of 0.046 nM, 0.137 nM, 0.412 nM, 1.235 nM, 3.704 nM, 11.11 nM, 33.33 nM, and lOO nM by 3-fold serial dilutions using 0.3 pL of Lipofectamine MessengerMax per well. </p>[000317] Following addition of oligonucleotide, cells were incubated for 72 hours prior to harvesting for total RNA. cDNA was synthesized from the total RNA extracts and qPCR was performed to determine expression levels of DMPK using a commercially available Taqman probe set in technical quadruplicate. All qPCR data were analyzed using a traditional AACT method and were normalized to a plate-based negative control that comprised of cells treated with vehicle control (0.3 m L/well Lipofectamine MessengerMax without any oligonucleotide). Data for each oligonucleotide to was fit to sigmoidal curve in order to determine an effective concentration of each oligonucleotide that provided a half-maximal response (EC-50). Results from these experiments are shown in Table 5. </p>[000318] Each of the eighteen antisense oligonucleotides selected for dose-dependent experimentation were capable of dose-dependently reducing DMPK in differentiated myotubes. Further, each of the tested antisense oligonucleotides reduced DMPK with EC-50 values below 25 nM. For example, antisense oligonucleotides comprising SEQ ID NOs: 161,</p>112, 119, 87, and 109 resulted in EC-50 values of 3.27 nM, 3.59 nM, 5.45 nM, 6.04 nM, and 24.59 nM, respectively. These data demonstrate that the antisense oligonucleotides shown in Table 5 are capable of dose-dependent reduction of DMPK in cellulo, suggesting that muscle targeting complexes comprising these antisense oligonucleotides would be capable of targeting DMPK in muscle tissues in vivo. \n\nTable 5.

C57BL/6 wild-type mice were intravenously injected with a single dose of a vehicle control (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)), DTX-P-060 antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) (10 mg/kg of RNA), DTX-C-007 control complex (10 mg/kg of RNA), or DTX-C-008 (10 mg/kg of RNA) on Day 0 and euthanized after a prescribed period of time, as described in Table 6. One group of mice in each experimental condition was subjected to a second dose (multi-dose groups) at four weeks (Day 28). Following euthanization, the mice were segmented into isolated tissue types and samples of tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscle tissues were subsequently assayed for expression levels of DMPK (FIGs. 13A-13B). </p>Table 6.
