In particular, it was confirmed that the ethyl acetate fraction of the Caragana Sinica root extract of the Example 4 showed more excellent inhibitory effect on the production of melanin than arbutin known as a whitening agent.</p>Experimental Example 2-3: Confirming inhibitory effect of \u03b1-viniferin on melanin productionIn order to confirm whitening effect of \u03b1-viniferin isolated from the fraction of Caragana Sinica root of the above Example 4, its effect on inhibiting a production of melanin was confirmed with regard to a B16F1 melanin-forming cell.</p>Specifically, the \u03b1-viniferin isolated from the ethyl acetate fraction of the ethanol extract of Caragana Sinica root obtained from the above Example 4 or arbutin, and \u03b1-MSH, a stimulant of melanin production, were treated at the same time, after which an amount of melanin was measured in 70 to 74 hours later as describe in the above Example 2-2.</p>As a result, as shown in Figure 4, an inhibitory effect of \u03b1-viniferin on melanin production, which was induced by \u03b1-MSH, was indicated as inhibition rate of 8% at a sample concentration of 4 \u00b5M, 21% at 6 \u00b5M and 63% at 8 \u00b5M respectively, and an IC50 value was 7 \u00b5M. On the other hand, in case of arbutin, a control substance, its inhibitory effect on melanin production, which was induced by \u03b1-MSH stimulation, was indicated as inhibitory rate of 13% at a sample concentration of 100 \u00b5M, 44% at 200 \u00b5M and 73% at 400 \u00b5M respectively, and an IC50 value was 242 \u00b5M. Thus, it was confirmed that a whitening effect of \u03b1-viniferin on melanin production, which was induced by \u03b1-MSH, was about 35 times higher than that of arbutin.</p>Formulation Example 1: Preparing of a solubilized formulation comprising the fraction of Caragana Sinica root extractIn order to confirm a stability of a cosmetic composition comprising a fraction of Caragana Sinica root extract as an active ingredient, the ethyl acetate fraction of Caragana Sinica root extract of the above Example 4 was dissolved in the mixed solvent of buthylene glycol and purified water at a ratio of 50 : 50, and then a solubilized formulation was prepared such as that shown in the following Table 4.\n[Table 4]PhaseIngredientContent (%)Water phasePurified waterTo 100Glycerin10 - 25Dipropylene GlycolBetaineD-panthenolSodium HyaluronateThickenerSuitable amountMetal ion sequestering agentSuitable amountSolubilized phasePEG-60 hydrogenated castor oil0-2PEG-40 hydrogenated castor oil0-2Polyhydric alcohol0-10FragranceSuitable amountEthanol0-20Addition IEthyl acetate fraction of Caragana Sinica root extract of Example 43.2Addition IIPreservativeSuitable amountOther additiveSuitable amount</p>&lt;Preparation Method&gt;(1) Water phase and solubilized phase were evenly mixed and dissolved, respectively.(2) The solubilized phase was inserted into the water phase to be mixed and solubilized together.(3) An addition I, comprising the ethyl acetate fraction of Caragana Sinica root extrac"
