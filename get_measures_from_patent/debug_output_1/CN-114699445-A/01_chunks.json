    " \u2103 for 30min in the dark, washed 1 times with 1 \u00d7 detection buffer, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20min, washed 1 times with 1 \u00d7 detection buffer, resuspended, and tested on the machine.</p>2.7 Western blotting for detecting proteins involved in apoptosis, autophagy and histone acetylation</p>After the cells were lysed by RIPA, protein quantification was performed by BCA method. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and subsequently transferred to a PVDF membrane pre-activated with methanol. Blocking with blocking solution for 15min, incubating for 2h at room temperature, and incubating overnight at 4 deg.C with slow shaking. On day 2, the secondary antibody was incubated at room temperature for 1h after washing with TBST, and developed by dropping a developing solution.</p>2.8 statistical analysis</p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS22.0 software. All the measured data are expressed by means of the mean +/-standard deviation, the two groups of data are compared by adopting a t test, the multiple groups of data are compared by adopting one-factor variance analysis, the significance level of all the statistical analysis is alpha-0.05, and the difference is shown by P &lt;0.05, so that the statistical significance is realized.</p>3 results</p>3.1 Effect of Sanzihuangshi formulation on MDS cell proliferation</p>The composition of Sanzi Huang Shi has effect in inhibiting SKM-1 cell proliferation, and can be processed for 24h, 48h and 72h</p>The IC50 values of (A) were 375.949. mu.g/ml, 104.447. mu.g/ml and 60.802. mu.g/ml, respectively, in a time and dose dependent manner, as shown in FIG. 1.</p>3.2 Effect of Sanzihuang Stone formulation intervention on MDS cell ROS levels</p>After the dry prognosis of the Sanzi Huang stone formula, the ROS level of MDS cells is obviously lower than that of a blank control group (P is less than 0.001). As shown in table 1 and fig. 2.</p>TABLE 1 comparison of ROS fluorescence intensity of drug-added group and blank control group</p></p>Note: ***: p &lt; 0.001 relative to the blank control</p>3.3 Effect of Sanzihuangshi formulation intervention on MDS cell autophagy at different concentrations</p>After the trikerite formula with different concentrations intervenes SKM-1 cells for 24 hours, compared with a blank control group, when the concentration of the trikerite formula is 300 mu g/ml, 450 mu g/ml and 600 mu g/ml, the expression level of autophagy substrate protein P62 is obviously reduced (P is less than 0.001), the expression of autophagy-related protein LC3II/I is increased (P is less than 0.05, P is less than 0.01) and the expression level of Beclin1 protein is increased (P is less than 0.01, P is less than 0.001), and the quantity and the quantitative brightness of autophagy vesicles are obviously increased (P is less than 0.01, P is less than 0.001); after 300 mu g/ml of three-seed yellow stone formula intervenes 0, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours of SKM-1 cells, compared with a blank "
