    "lected from non-transfected 293T cells stimulates ex vivo expansion of HSCs [0105] Twenty freshly isolated CD45.2 bone marrow SP Sca-1+ CD45+ cells were cultured for 10 days in serum- free IMDM supplemented with 10 ng/ml SCF, 20 ng/ml TPO, 20 ng/ml IGF-2, and 10 ng/ml FGF-I (STIF medium; FIG. 2 A, bar 1), in freshly collected serum-free conditioned STIF medium from 293T cells (bar 2), or in the same conditioned medium after freeze/thaw (bar 3). The cultured cells were co-transplanted with 1 x 10<sup>5</sup> CD45.1 total bone marrow cells into CD45.1 recipients (n = 5-6). [0106] FIG. 2B shows the multilineage contribution of cultured cells at conditions represented by bar 2 of FIG. 2 A at 5 months post-transplant (n = 6). Data shown in the top panel are representative FACS plots of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from one mouse at 5 months post-transplant (from bar 2 of FIG. IA). Percentages of cells in each quadrant are listed. The summary of percent repopulation data from mice in bar 2 of FIG. IA for T- lymphoid, B-lymphoid, and myeloid cells is plotted in the bottom panel. [0107] Serum- free 293T conditioned medium was analyzed by mass spectrometry in order to identify potential candidate proteins that stimulated ex vivo expansion of HSCs. Peptides from several proteins were identified. A partial list of peptides identified in the mass spectrometry analysis of the fraction of serum- free IMDM based conditioned medium of 293T cells that contained proteins smaller than 70 kD is shown in Table I. Proteins found in common with the control serum- free IMDM sample are not shown.

FIG. 3 shows western blot analysis of purified human IGFBP-2 (positive control; lane 1), serum-free 3T3 conditioned medium (negative control; lane 2), and serum- free 293T conditioned medium (lane 3) detected by anti-human IGFBP-2 polyclonal antibody. Purified IGFBP-2 stimulates ex vivo expansion of HSCs. \n\n [0110] As demonstrated herein, IGFBP-2 stimulates ex vivo expansion of HSCs. Twenty CD45.2 bone marrow SP Sca-1<sup>+</sup> CD45<sup>+</sup> cells were cultured for 5 days in STIF medium with 100 ng/ml Angptl3 (bars 1 and 4); in the same medium with 500 ng/ml IGFBP-2 (bars 2 and 5); and in the same medium with 200 ng/ml Timp-1 (bars 3 and 6) (see FIG. 4A). The cells were then cotransplanted with 1 x 10<sup>5</sup> CD45.1 total bone marrow cells into CD45.1 recipients (n = 5). Engraftments at 1 month or 4 months post-transplant are shown in FIG. 4A.
