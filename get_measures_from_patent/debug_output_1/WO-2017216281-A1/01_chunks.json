Samples of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain H37Rv were taken from cultures in logarithmic growth phase. These were first diluted to obtain an optical density of 0.3 at 600 nm wavelength and then diluted 1/100, resulting in an inoculum of approximately 5x10 exp5 colony forming units per well. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C in plastic bags to prevent evaporation. After 7 days, resazurin was added to all wells. Two days later, fluorescence was measured on a Gemini EM </p>Microplate Reader with 543 excitation and 590 nm emission wavelengths and MIC50 and/or pICso values (or the like, e.g. IC50, IC90, PIC90, etc) were (or may be) calculated. TEST 2 </p> Round-bottom, sterile 96-well plastic microtiter plates are filled with 100 \u03bc\u0390 of </p>Middlebrook (lx) 7H9 broth medium. Subsequently, an extra 100 \u03bc\u0390 medium is added to column 2. Stock solutions (200 x final test concentration) of compounds are added in</p>2 \u03bc\u0390 volumes to a series of duplicate wells in column 2 so as to allow evaluation of their effects on bacterial growth. Serial 2-fold dilutions are made directly in the microtiter plates from column 2 to 11 using a multipipette. Pipette tips are changed after every</p>3 dilutions to minimize pipetting errors with high hydrophobic compounds. Untreated control samples with (column 1) and without (column 12) inoculum are included in each microtiter plate. Approximately 10000 CFU per well of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (strain H37RV), in a volume of 100 \u03bc\u0390 in Middlebrook (lx) 7H9 broth medium, is added to the rows A to H, except column 12. The same volume of broth medium without inoculum is added to column 12 in row A to H. The cultures are \n\n incubated at 37\u00b0C for 7 days in a humidified atmosphere (incubator with open air valve and continuous ventilation). On day 7 the bacterial growth is checked visually. </p>The 90 % minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC90) is determined as the concentration with no visual bacterial growth. </p>TEST 3: Time kill assays </p> Bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity of the compounds can be determined in a time kill assay using the",
    " the test compounds are incubated at 37 \u00b0C. After 0, 1, 4, 7, 14 and 21 days of incubation samples are removed for determination of viable counts by serial dilution (10 <sup>1</sup> to 10<sup>\"6</sup>) in Middlebrook 7H9 medium and plating (100 \u03bc\u0390) on Middlebrook 7H11 agar. The plates are incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 21 days and the number of colonies are determined. Killing curves can be constructed by plotting the logioCFU per ml versus time. A bactericidal effect is commonly defined as 3-logio decrease in number of CFU per ml as compared to untreated inoculum. The potential carryover effect of the drugs is removed by serial dilutions and counting the colonies at highest dilution used for plating. </p>TEST 4 (see also test 1 above; in this test a different strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain is employed) </p>Appropriate solutions of experimental and reference compounds were made in 96 well plates with 7H9 medium. Samples of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain EH 4.0 (361.269) were taken from cultures in stationary growth phase. These were first diluted to obtain an optical density of 0.3 at 600 nm wavelength and then diluted 1/100, resulting in an inoculum of approximately 5x10 exp5 colony forming units per well. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C in plastic bags to prevent evaporation. After 7 days, resazurin was added to all wells. Two days later, fluorescence was measured on a Gemini EM Microplate Reader with 543 nm excitation and 590 nm emission wavelengths and MIC50 and/or pIC50 values (or the like, e.g. IC50, IC90, pIC90, etc) were (or may be) calculated. pICso values may be recorded below in \u03bcg/mL. </p>RESULTS </p> Compounds of the invention/examples, for example when tested in Test 1 or Test 2 decribed above, may typically have an IC90 value from 0.01 to 10 \u03bcg/ml.
