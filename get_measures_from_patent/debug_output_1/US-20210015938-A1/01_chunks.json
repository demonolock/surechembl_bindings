    " 4, 680-694).</p>The term \u201cantibody\u201d, as used herein, is intended to refer to immunoglobulin molecules comprised of four polypeptide chains, two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains inter-connected by disulfide bonds. Each heavy chain is comprised of a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as HCVR or VH) and a heavy chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region is comprised of three domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3. Each light chain is comprised of a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as LCVR or VL) and a light chain constant region. The light chain constant region is comprised of one domain, CL. The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions (CDR), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each VH and VL is composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4.</p>The term \u201canti-TNF\u03b1 antibody\u201d or \u201can antibody that binds to TNF\u03b1\u201d refers to an antibody that is capable of binding TNF\u03b1, e.g., with sufficient affinity such that the antibody is useful as a therapeutic agent in targeting TNF\u03b1. The extent of binding of an anti-TNF\u03b1 antibody to an unrelated, non-TNF\u03b1 protein can be less than about 10% of the binding of the antibody to TNF\u03b1 as measured, e.g., by a radioimmunoassay (RIA). In certain embodiments, an antibody that binds to TNF\u03b1 has a dissociation constant (Kd) of \u22641 \u03bcM, \u2264100 nM, \u226410 nM, \u22641 nM, or \u22640.1 nM.</p>The term \u201cimmunoconjugate,\u201d \u201cconjugate,\u201d \u201cantibody-drug conjugate,\u201d or \u201cADC\u201d as used herein refers to a compound or a derivative thereof that is conjugated to a protein such as a cell binding agent (e.g., an anti-TNF\u03b1 antibody) Such immunoconjugates can be defined by a generic formula: (SM-L-Q)<sub>n</sub>-A, wherein SM=radical derived from a small-molecule glucocorticoid receptor agonist, e.g., a glucocorticosteroid, L=linker, Q=heterobifunctional group or is absent, and A=a protein (e.g., an antibody), and n=1-10. Immunoconjugates can also be defined by the generic formula in reverse order: A-(Q-L-SM)<sub>n</sub>.</p>In the present disclosure, the term \u201clinker\u201d refers to a chemical moiety capable of linking the anti-TNF\u03b1 protein (e.g. antibody) to a glucocorticosteroid. Linkers may be susceptible to cleavage (a \u201ccleavable linker\u201d) thereby facilitating release of the glucocorticosteroid. For example, such cleavable linkers may be susceptible to peptidase-induced cleavage, at conditions under which the glucocorticosteroid and/or the antibody remains active.</p>In particular, the cleavable linker component disclosed herein comprises a peptide comprising two to three amino acid residues (a dipeptide or tripeptide) and specifically to dipeptides and tripeptides selected from the group consisting of alanine-alanine (Ala-Ala), glycine-glutamic acid (Gly-Glu), glutamic acid-alanine-alanine (Glu-Ala-Ala), and glycine-lysine (Gly-L"
