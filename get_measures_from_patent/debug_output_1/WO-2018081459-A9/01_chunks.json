    "the viral surface envelope proteins, the HBsAg, and can be structurally and functionally divided into the pre- S1, pre-S2, and S regions. There are three forms of HBsAG, small (S), middle (M), and large (L). The core or C gene has the precore and core regions. Multiple in-frame translation initiation codons are a feature of the S and C genes, which give rise to related but functionally distinct proteins. The C gene encodes either the viral nucleocapsid HBcAg or hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) depending on whether translation is initiated from the core or precore regions, respectively. The core protein self-assembles into a capsid-like structure. The precore ORF encodes a signal peptide that directs the translation product to the endoplasmic reticulum of the infected cell, where the protein is further processed to form the secreted HBeAg. The function of HBeAg is largely uncharacterized, although it has been implicated in immune tolerance, whose function is to promote persistent infection (Milich and Liang (2003) Hepatology 38:1075-1086. The polymerase (pol) is a large protein of approximately 800 amino acids and is encoded by the P ORF. Pol is functionally divided into three domains: the terminal protein domain, which is involved in encapsidation and initiation of minus- strand synthesis; the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain, which catalyzes genome synthesis; and the ribonuclease H domain, which degrades pregenomic RNA and facilitates replication. The HBV X ORF encodes a 16.5-kd protein (HBxAg) with multiple functions, including signal transduction, transcriptional activation, DNA repair, and inhibition of protein degradation (Cross et al., (1993) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 90:8078-8082; Bouchard and Schneider (2004) J Virol 78:12725-12734). The mechanism of this activity and the biologic function of HBxAg in the viral life-cycle remain largely unknown. However, it is well- established that HBxAg is necessary for productive HBV infection in vivo and may contribute to the oncogenic potential of HBV (Liang (2009) Hepatology 49(Suppl S5):S13- S21). </p> Despite the availability of an effective prophylactic vaccine, over 240 million people remain chronically infected with HBV and more than 500,000 people die each year from the liver diseases that result from chronic infection (World Health Organization (2015) Hepatitis B Fact Sheet FS204). The currently available therapeutic options for HBV infection \n\n include nucleos(t)ide analogues and alpha interferon (IFN-\u03b1). However, these treatments have several limitations. Nucleos(t)ide analogues effectively suppress virus replication but do not eliminate the infection. Once treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogues is stopped, the virus rapidly rebounds in the infected person. Furthermore, long-term treatment with antivirals can result in the generation of drug-resistant mutant viruses. In contrast to nucleos(t)ide analogues, IFN-\u03b1, which has both antiviral and immunomodulatory activities, can produce more durable ",

(2001),\u201cProPred: prediction of HLA-DR binding sites.\u201d Bioinformatics, 17(12), 1236-37). </p> In some embodiments the MHC stabilizing region is designed based on the subject\u2019s particular MHC. In that way the MHC stabilizing region can be optimized for each patient. </p> In some instances each epitope of an antigen may include a MHC stabilizing region. All of the MHC stabilizing regions within the epitopes may be the same or they may be different. The MHC stabilizing regions may be at the N terminal portion of the peptide or the C terminal portion of the peptide. Alternatively the MHC stabilizing regions may be in the central region of the peptide. The neoepitopes in some embodiments are 13 residues or less in length and usually consist of between about 8 and about 11 residues, particularly 9 or 10 residues. In other embodiments the neoepitopes may be designed to be longer. For instance, the neoepitopes may have extensions of 2-5 amino acids toward the N- and C- terminus of each corresponding gene product. The use of a longer peptide may allow endogenous processing by patient cells and may lead to more effective antigen presentation and induction of T cell responses. </p> The neoepitopes selected for inclusion in the vaccine typically will be high affinity binding peptides. In some aspect the neoepitope binds an HLA protein with greater affinity than a wild-type peptide. The neoepitope has an IC50 of at least less than 5000 nM, at least less than 500 nM, at least less than 250 nM, at least less than 200 nM, at least less than 150 nM, at least less than 100 nM, at least less than 50 nM or less in some embodiments. Typically, peptides with predicted IC50&lt;50 nM, are generally considered medium to high affinity binding peptides and will be selected for testing their affinity empirically using biochemical assays of HLA-binding. Finally, it will be determined whether the human immune system can mount effective immune responses against these mutated tumor antigens and thus effectively kill tumor but not normal cells. \n\n Neoepitopes having the desired activity may be modified as necessary to provide certain desired attributes, e.g. improved pharmacological characteristics, while increasing or at least retaining substantially all of the biological activity of the unmodified peptide to bind the desired MHC molecule and activate the appropriate T cell or B cell. For instance, the neoepitopes may be subject to various changes, such as substitutions, either conservative or non-conservative, where such changes might provide for certain advantages in their use, such as improved MHC binding. By conservative substitutions is meant replacing an amino acid residue with another which is biologically and/or chemically similar, e.g., one hydrophobic residue for another, or one polar residue for another. The substitutions include combinations such as Gly, Ala; Val, Ile, Leu, Met; Asp, Glu; Asn, Gln; Ser, Thr; Lys, Arg; and Phe, Tyr. The effect of single amino acid substitutions may also be probed using D- amino acids. Such modifications may be made using well known peptide synthesis procedures, as described in e.g., Merrifield, Science 23",
    "nths, up to three months, up to four month, up to five months, up to six months, up to seven months, up to eight months, up to nine months, up to ten months, up to eleven months, up to 1 year, up to 1 and \u00bd years, up to two years, up to three years, or up to four years. The schedule may be the same or varied. In some embodiments the schedule is weekly for the first 3 weeks and then monthly thereafter. </p> At any point in the treatment the patient may be examined to determine whether the mutations in the vaccine are still appropriate. Based on that analysis the vaccine may be adjusted or reconfigured to include one or more different mutations or to remove one or more mutations. </p> It has been recognized and appreciated that, by analyzing certain properties of cancer associated mutations, optimal neoepitopes may be assessed and/or selected for inclusion in an mRNA vaccine. A property of a neoepitope or set of neoepitopes may include, for instance, an assessment of gene or transcript-level expression in patient RNA-seq or other nucleic acid analysis, tissue-specific expression in available databases, known oncogenes/tumor suppressors, variant call confidence score, RNA-seq allele-specific expression, conservative vs. non-conservative AA substitution, position of point mutation \n\n (Centering Score for increased TCR engagement), position of point mutation (Anchoring Score for differential HLA binding), Selfness: &lt;100% core epitope homology with patient WES data, HLA-A and\u2013B IC50 for 8mers-11mers, HLA-DRB1 IC50 for 15mers-20mers, promiscuity Score (i.e. number of patient HLAs predicted to bind), HLA-C IC50 for 8mers- 11mers, HLA-DRB3-5 IC50 for 15mers-20mers, HLA-DQB1/A1 IC50 for 15mers-20mers, HLA-DPB1/A1 IC50 for 15mers-20mers, Class I vs Class II proportion, Diversity of patient HLA-A, -B and DRB1 allotypes covered, proportion of point mutation vs complex epitopes (e.g. frameshifts), and /or pseudo-epitope HLA binding scores. </p> In some embodiments, the properties of cancer associated mutations used to identify optimal neoepitopes are properties related to the type of mutation, abundance of mutation in patient sample, immunogenicity, lack of self-reactivity, and nature of peptide composition. </p> The type of mutation should be determined and considered as a factor in determining whether a putative epitope should be included in a vaccine. The type of mutation may vary. In some instances it may be desirable to include multiple different types of mutations in a single vaccine. In other instances a single type of mutation may be more desirable. A value for particular mutation can be weighted and calculated. </p> The abundance of the mutation in a patient sample may also be scored and factored into the decision of whether a putative epitope should be included in a vaccine. Highly abundant mutations may promote a more robust immune response. </p> In some embodiments, the personalized mRNA cancer vaccines described herein may be used for treatment of cancer. </p> mRNA cancer vaccines may be administered prophylactically or therapeutically as part of an active immunization scheme to healthy individuals or early in cancer or late stage and/or metastatic cancer.
