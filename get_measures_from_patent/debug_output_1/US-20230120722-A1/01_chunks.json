    " spinal trauma injuries, sub-arachnoid hemorrhage in the brain, invasive surgical procedures, surgical adhesions, rotator cuff injuries, burns, reconstructive surgery, ulcerative conditions (diabetes), etc. Other fibrotic diseases and conditions include fibrosis in the lungs, such as pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, progressive massive fibrosis and radiation-induced lung injury following treatment for cancer; in the liver, such as cirrhosis and biliary atresia; fibrosis in the heart, such as atrial fibrosis, endomyocardial fibrosis, old myocardial infarction; fibrosis in the brain, such as glial scar; pancreatitis; arthrofibrosis; Crohn's disease; Dupuytren's contracture; keloid; mediastinal fibrosis; myelofibrosis; Peyronie's disease; nephrogenic systemic fibrosis; retroperitoneal fibrosis; scleroderma or systemic sclerosis.</p>Fibrosis may also occur in connection with organ transplantation, such as of kidneys, lungs, livers, hearts, etc., and in connection with cell therapies and cell transplantation, such as of islet of Langerhans, hepatocytes, insulin producing cells, stem cells, progenitor cells, etc.</p>Interestingly, the gene expression data also shows that dextran sulfate of the embodiments activates the production of a natural scar reducing molecule called decorin, which further blocks scar production by \u2018mopping up\u2019 the growth factors that stimulate scar production by fibroblasts.</p>Decorin is a glycoprotein of on average 90-140 kD molecular weight. It belongs to the small-leucine rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family and consists of a protein core containing leucine repeats with a glucosaminoglycan (GAG) chain consisting of either chondroitin sulphate or dermatan sulphate. It binds to type I collagen fibrils through the decorin type I collagen binding region.</p>Decorin acts as a transforming growth factor beta 1 or 2 (TGF-\u03b21/2) antagonist and reduces scarring. Reports show that in acute scarring the dominant effect of decorin is anti-fibrogenic through suppression of inflammatory fibrosis by neutralization of TGF-\u03b21/2. Decorin also binds directly to collagen and one of its functions is to influence on the organization of collagen during wound healing.</p>Decorin has previously been described in inhibition of scanning in a model of cerebral lesion, hydrocephalus, and chronic spinal cord wounds. Decorin also induces fibrolysis of existing trabecular meshwork scars in a glaucoma model.</p>Taken together the anti-scarring actions of dextran sulfate of the embodiments indicate the potential for use to treat all clinical conditions where scarring is a problem. Dextran sulfate should work on both old and new scars. This is confirmed in the experimental data showing that dextran sulfate of the embodiments was capable of inducing dissolution of already established scar elements in the trabecular meshwork in glaucomatous eyes. This is a significant advantage of dextran sulfate of the embodiments since it cannot on"
