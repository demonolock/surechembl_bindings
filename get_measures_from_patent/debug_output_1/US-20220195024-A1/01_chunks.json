    "e the general class of which a specific example may be used for illustration. The terminology herein is used to describe specific embodiments of the invention, but their usage does not limit the invention, except as outlined in the claims.</p>As discussed above, ELTD1 is known to be involved in angiogenesis and is linked to glioblastoma. Little else is known about its role in biology and disease. Here, the inventors have shown that ELTD1 is useful for diagnosis and treatment of other diseases including multiple sclerosis and retinopathy, and may, more generally, be important in tissue regeneration. The inventors used the antibodies taught herein against ELTD1.</p>As used herein, the terms \u201cantibody\u201d or \u201cantibody peptide(s)\u201d refer to an intact antibody, or a binding fragment thereof that competes with the intact antibody for specific binding. Binding fragments are produced by recombinant DNA techniques, or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact antibodies. Binding fragments include Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032)<sub>2</sub>, Fv, and single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibodies. An antibody other than a \u201cbispecific\u201d or \u201cbifunctional\u201d antibody is understood to have each of its binding sites identical. An antibody substantially inhibits adhesion of a receptor to a counter receptor when an excess of antibody reduces the quantity of receptor bound to counter receptor by at least about 20%, 40%, 60% or 80%, and more usually greater than about 85% (as measured in an in vitro competitive binding assay).</p>As used herein, the term \u201cantibody\u201d is used in the broadest sense, and specifically covers monoclonal antibodies (including full length antibodies or other bivalent, Fc-region containing antibodies such as bivalent scFv Fc-fusion antibodies), polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies), and antibody fragments (e.g., Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032)<sub>2</sub>, Fv, scFv) so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity. Antibodies (Abs) and immunoglobulins (Igs) are glycoproteins having the same structural characteristics. While antibodies exhibit binding specificity to a specific antigen, immunoglobulins include both antibodies and other antibody-like molecules that lack antigen specificity. Polypeptides of the latter kind are, for example, produced at low levels by the lymph system and at increased levels by myelomas. The present invention includes monoclonal antibodies (and binding fragments thereof) that are completely recombinant, in other words, where the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) are genetically spliced into a human antibody backbone, often referred to as veneering an antibody. Thus, in certain aspects the monoclonal antibody is a fully synthesized antibody. In certain embodiments, the monoclonal antibodies (and binding fragments thereof) can be made in bacterial or eukaryotic cells, including plant cells.</p>As used herein, the term \u201cantibody fragment\u201d refers to a portion of a full-length antibody, generall"
