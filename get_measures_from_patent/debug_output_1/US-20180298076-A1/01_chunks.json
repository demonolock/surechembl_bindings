FIG. 8B shows analysis of dephosphorylated samples of phospho-Thr5-glucagon by ESI-LC/MS. FIG. 8C shows dephosphorylated samples of phospho-Ser8-glucagon analyzed using ESI-LC/MS. Enhanced mass spectra of native glucagon (871.1728, z=+4), phospho-Ser8-glucagon (m/z=891.1609, z=+4) and dephosphorylated phospho-Ser8-glucagon (m/z=871.1705, z=+4 for phospho-Thr5-glucagon and m/z=871.1704, z=+4 for phospho-Ser8-glucagon) are compared.</p>FIGS. 9A-9C are plots showing secondary structure measured using far-UV CD spectroscopy. FIG. 9A is a comparison of the secondary structure of phosphoglucagons (pH 7.4) with that of native glucagon (pH 10.4). Comparisons of the secondary structures of dephosphorylated phospho-Thr5-glucagon (FIG. 9B) and phospho-Ser8-glucagon (FIG. 9C) (pH 7.4) with their phosphorylated forms (pH 7.4) are also presented. The secondary structure of the phosphoglucagons is not altered following dephosphorylation.</p>FIGS. 10A-10B are photographs showing a visual comparison of phosphorylated and dephosphorylated samples of phospho-Thr5-glucagon (FIG. 10A) and phospho-Ser8-glucagon (FIG. 10B) when stored for 2 days at pH 7.4 stored at 5\u00b0 C. Haziness in the dephosphorylated samples indicates fibrillation.</p>FIG. 11 is a schematic showing an enzymatic process to phosphorylate an amino acid.</p>FIG. 12 shows the results of an in vitro glucagon receptor binding assay, plotted as luminescence signal vs. concentration of glucagon or phosphoglucagon. The assay uses aequorin luminescence following G-protein receptor (GPCR) mediated calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) influx to measure glucagon receptor binding in a transfected cell line. Elevated luminescence for cells exposed to glucagon is consistent with receptor binding, while low levels for phospho-Thr5-glucagon indicate that it does not bind the glucagon receptor in its phosphorylated form. Luminescence for phosphor-Ser8-glucagon at higher concentrations suggests some receptor binding.</p>FIG. 13 shows the in vivo activity of glucagon and three phosphoglucagons (phospho-Thr5-glucagon, phosopho-Ser8-glucagon and phospho-Ser16-glucagon) following s.c. administration of a 7.1 nmol/kg dose to rats. At this dose, phospho-Thr5 and phospho-Ser16-glucagon show blood glucose elevation comparable to that of native glucagon, while phospho-Ser8-glucagon shows a somewhat lower and slower increase in blood glucose.</p>FIG. 14 extends the results of FIG. 13 to two additional phosphoglucagons: phospho-Tyr13-glucagon and phospho-Thr7-glucagon. At this dose (7.1 nmol/kg), phospho-Tyr13-glucagon shows blood glucose elevation comparable to native glucagon, while phospho-Thr7-glucagon shows a somewhat slower increase.</p>FIG. 15 shows the in vivo activity of glucagon, phospho-Thr5-glucagon and phospho-Ser16-glucagon following s.c. administration of a 2.8 nmol/kg dose, approximately 40% of the dose admin",

Addition of antioxidants may prevent phosphoglucagon oxidation and improve the long-term storage stability of these peptides in solution.</p>Example 7: Some Phosphoglucagons Bind the Glucagon Receptor in an In Vitro AssayThe glucagon receptor binding and activity of phosphoglucagons were tested using an AequoScreen GPCR Cell Line purchased from PerkinElmer (Waltham, Mass.). The assay uses CHO-K1 cells previously transfected with plasmid containing the sequence coding for the glucagon receptor, together with the photoprotein aequorin. In this assay, GPCR activation mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is monitored by measuring the luminescence of aequorin upon interaction with Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% FBS without antibiotic for 18 hours. Cells were harvested under sterile conditions and incubated with 5 \u03bcM of coelenterazine h at room temperature for 4 hours. Cells were then diluted to 1\u00d710<sup>5 </sup>cells/mL and assays carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Glucagon or a phosphoglucagon at different concentrations (2 nM to 64 \u03bcM) in assay buffer (DMEM/HAM's F12 with HEPES) was separately incubated with 50 \u03bcL of cells (\u02dc5000 cells) in a 96 well plate. The relative light emission was quickly recorded within 8 sec of adding the cells to the samples using a luminescence plate reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham, Mass.).</p>FIG. 12 shows the results of the in vitro receptor binding assay, plotted as luminescence signal vs. concentration of glucagon or phosphoglucagon. In this assay, greater luminescence signal is consistent with greater receptor binding. Below 50 nM, none of the three glucagons tested (glucagon, phospho-Ser16-glucagon, phospho-Thr5-glucagon) shows a detectable luminescence signal. Between 50 and 1000 nM, the signal for glucagon reaches a maximum, then decreases to a plateau value at concentrations &gt;1000 nM. Phospho-Ser16-glucagon shows little to no luminescence signal at concentrations &lt;1000 nM, consistent with limited receptor binding. At concentrations &gt;1000 nM, the luminescence signal for phospho-Ser16-glucagon increases, reaching a plateau value similar to that for native glucagon, consistent with receptor binding in this concentration range. Phospho-Thr5-glucagon shows little to no luminescence signal throughout the concentration range tested, and thus shows no evidence of binding to the glucagon receptor in its phosphorylated form.</p>Example 8: Phosphoglucagons Show Blood Glucose Elevation In Vivo Comparable to Native GlucagonTo measure in vivo activity in rats, phosphoglucagons were first extensively dialyzed in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. About 7.1 or 2.8 nmol/kg of either glucagon or a phosphoglucagon was then subcutaneously injected into conscious, fed male Wistar rats each weighing \u02dc400 g. Rats were catheterized to enable collection of blood samples at various time points. The total blood glucose "
