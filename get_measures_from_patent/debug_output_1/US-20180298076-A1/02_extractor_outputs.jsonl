{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nGlucagon or a phosphoglucagon at different concentrations (2 nM to 64 \u03bcM) in assay buffer (DMEM/HAM's F12 with HEPES) was separately incubated with 50 \u03bcL of cells (\u02dc5000 cells) in a 96 well plate.\nBelow 50 nM, none of the three glucagons tested (glucagon, phospho-Ser16-glucagon, phospho-Thr5-glucagon) shows a detectable luminescence signal.\nBetween 50 and 1000 nM, the signal for glucagon reaches a maximum, then decreases to a plateau value at concentrations >1000 nM.\nAbout 7.1 or 2.8 nmol/kg of either glucagon or a phosphoglucagon was then subcutaneously injected into conscious, fed male Wistar rats each weighing \u02dc400 g.\nCells were harvested under sterile conditions and incubated with 5 \u03bcM of coelenterazine h at room temperature for 4 hours."}
