    " incubating for 90 min with slow mixing. The range of fluorescence polarization determination is Ex/Em = 620/688.Data Analysis: The fluorescence polarization signal was converted into nM according to the AMP/GMP standard curve and the control % enzyme activity relative to the DMSO calculated by Excel software. The Curve was fit with GraphPad Prism (drawing medical icons).Table 6: Results of in vitro screening test of compound according to the present disclosureCompoundIC50 (nM)Compound 10.685</p>Conclusion: Compound 1 showed excellent in vitro activity of inhibiting phosphodiesterase 4B subtype (PDE4B).</p>Testing Example 2: Evaluation of inhibition of TNF\u03b1 production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMC) in vitroThe inhibitory activity of Compound 1 of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TNF\u03b1 production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.</p>Procedures:\n1. Collecting normal human whole blood, which was anticoagulated with EDTA-K2 anticoagulation tube;2. Separating PBMC with Ficoll density gradient centrifugation, counting and adjusting the cell concentration to 2x10<sup>6</sup>/mL;3. To U-bottom 96-well plate were added 2x10<sup>5</sup> cells/well, LPS 1 ng/mL was added, various concentrations of compound at 100 \u00b5M, 10 \u00b5M, 1 \u00b5M, 100 nM, 10 nM, 1 nM, 100 pM, 10 pM, 200 \u00b5l system/well, in duplicated wells;4. Incubating for 24 h, collecting the supernatant;5. Detecting the level of TNF\u03b1 in supernatant with ELISA, fitting the inhibition curve and calculating IC50 with Graphpad Prism software.\nTable 7: Inhibitory activity of compound according to the present disclosure on TNF\u03b1 production in hPBMCCompoundIC50(nM)CompoundIC50(nM)Apremilast16.5 (n=3)Compound 10.56 (n=2)n represents test times.</p>Conclusion: Compound 1 showed excellent in vitro activity of inhibiting TNF\u03b1 production in hPBMC, which was superior over Apremilast.</p>Testing Example 3: In vivo CIA modelObject:The collagen-induced mice arthritis model is an animal model used to evaluate the efficacy of drug treatment of psoriatic arthritis, and the pathogenesis and symptoms are significantly correlated with psoriatic arthritis. A series of symptoms similar to human psoriatic arthritis, such as redness and swelling of the joint, articular cartilage damage, and capsula articularis damage are elicited in the model by injection of type II collagen to activate reactivity of B cells, T cell on bone collagen, and the activated B cells and T cells enter the joints to cause joint inflammation. During pre-clinical evaluation of candidate compounds for treating psoriatic arthritis, collagen-induced arthritis in mice is often used to evaluate the effectiveness.</p>The purpose of this experiment was to study the therapeutic effect of Compound 1 on collagen-induced arthritis in mice, so as to provide preclinical pharmacodynamic relevant information for subsequent clinical studies.</p>Procedures:1.
