    "f the DSPE-PEG-alkyne (143.7 mg, 0.034 mmol) and azide-tetraethylene glycol-functionalized pentameric formyl thiophene acetic acid, (\u201cN<sub>3</sub>-p-FTAA,\u201d 40 mg, 0.049 mmol) in methanol (3 mL), ethyl acetate (1 mL) and water (1 mL), were added sodium ascorbate (1.07 mg, 0.005 mmol) and copper(II)acetate (0.49 mg, 0.002 mmol). The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. The organic solvents were removed in vacuo and the resulting residue diluted with 20% ethanol/water mixture (20 mL). The diluted residue was then loaded in a 2000 MWCO dialysis bag and dialyzed against MES buffer (50 mM, 5 litters) and then water (2\u00d75 liters), for 12 hours each. The water was then removed, by freeze drying to obtain Conjugate A as a white powder (148 mg).</p>Example 2A: Preparation of Conjugate A Liposomes1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), Cholesterol (CHOL), Conjugate A, DSPE-DOTA-Gd, and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-2000] (DSPE-mPEG-2000), in the molar proportions 31:85:40:0.5:25:2.5, respectively, were dissolved in tert-butanol (1 mL), and histidine (10 mM)/saline (150 mM) buffer (9 mL, pH 7.5) was then added. The colloid was hydrated at 60\u00b0 C. for 45 minutes, and further extruded in a 10 mL Lipex extruder using a 400 nm (10 passes), then followed by 200 nm (10 passes) Nuclepore Track-Etch Membranes. The extruded mixture was then diafiltered using a MicroKros cross-flow diafiltration cartridge (500 kD, 20 cm<sup>2 </sup>surface area), using histidine/saline buffer (pH 7.5) and collecting 10 mL fractions (16-time collections). The final liposomes (50 mM, 10 mL) were characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and ICP-AES analysis, and then stored at 4\u00b0 C.</p>Example 2B: Synthesis of AP FibrilsA\u03b2 fibrils were synthesized according to the method of Klunk et al. Ann Neurol, 2004; 55: 306-19, the entire teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. Briefly, A\u03b2<sub>(1-40) </sub>peptide (rPeptide, Bogart, Ga.) was dissolved in phospho-buffered saline, pH 7.4 to a final concentration of 433 \u03bcg/mL (100 \u03bcM). The solution was stirred using a magnetic stir bar at 700 rpm for 4 h at room temperature to drive the formation of fibrils. The stock solution was aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. for future use. The stock solutions were stirred thoroughly before removing aliquots for binding assays to maintain a homogenous suspension of fibrils. The stock solutions were stirred thoroughly prior to removing aliquots for binding assays, to insure a homogenous suspension of fibrils.</p>Example 2C: Binding of pFTAA, Conjugate A-Liposomes to A\u03b2<sub>(1-40) </sub>Conjugate A-liposomes (50 mM, 1 mL) prepared as described above were centrifuged at 14,700 RPM for 10 minutes and at room temperature, and the concentration of free ligand (p-FTAA) in the supernatant was determined by fluorescence (Ex-360 nm, Em-535 nm). A\u03b2<sub>(1-40) </sub>fibrils in PBS (20 \u03bcM, pH 7.5) were incubated with free ligand or Conjugate-A-liposomes at different concentrations and in a reaction volume of 0.3 mL. The set-up was gently agitated at room temperature for 2.5 hours. The fibrils were washed (\u00d73) with 0.3 mL PBS each wash and the supernatant collected at 14, 700 RPM after 2 minutes. The fluorescence for ligands bound to fibrils was obtained from the unbound ligands (supernatant) at excitation and emission wavelengths mentioned above. The binding constant (kb) was determined by plotting the fraction coverage of free ligand or Conjugate-A-liposomes on fibrils against incubation concentration.</p>Examples 2A-2C: DiscussionFIG. 4B is a mass spectrum showing that the found average neutral mass for Conjugate-A was 5141.23, calculated for molecular weight 5142.21 (C<sub>237</sub>H<sub>431</sub>N<sub>5</sub>O<sub>100</sub>PS<sub>5</sub>). The concentrations of phosphorus (25.43 mM) and gadolinium (10.38 mM) in the 50 mM batch of Conjugate-A-liposomes prepared were determined by ICP-AES analysis. Free ligand p-FTAA and Conjugate-A-liposomes were quantified (&gt;43% in the supernatant) used for binding curve assay, using a standard curve (FIG. 5A). The supernatant from centrifuged Conjugate-A-liposomes was used in binding experiments, but not the intact Conjugate-A-liposomes, to get rid of aggregates which can impact binding efficiency. Surprisingly and unexpectedly, the binding constant (k<sub>b</sub>) for Conjugate-A-liposomes was 2.0 nM, half of that for the free ligand, p-FTAA, which was 4 nM. (FIG. 5B) Moreover, despite the much larger size compared to the free ligand, the Conjugate-A-liposomes readily entered deep into brain tissues to stain concentrated A\u03b2 deposits (FIG. 6A), tau tangles (FIG. 6B), neuritic plaques (FIG. 6C), and diffuse plaques (FIG. 6D).</p>Example 3A: Preparation of Conjugate A LiposomesLiposomes of 50 mM lipid content were prepared by dissolving 1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), Cholesterol (CHOL), 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-2000] (DSPE-mPEG-2000) and Conjugate A, in the molar proportions 31:85:40:0.5:25:2.5, respectively, in ethanol (1 mL). The ethanolic colloid was hydrated at 62\u00b0 C. for 45 minutes with histidine saline (10 mM)/saline (150 mM) buffer (9 mL, pH 7.5) to form liposomes. The liposomes were extruded in a 10 mL Lipex extruder using a 400 nm (3 passes), then followed by 100 nm (4 passes) Nuclepore Track-Etch Membranes. The extruded mixture was then diafiltered overnight using a MicroKros cross-flow diafiltration cartridge (500 kD, 20 cm<sup>2 </sup>surface area), using histidine/saline buffer (pH 7.5) to remove ethanol. The final liposomes (50 mM, 10 mL) were characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and ICP-AES analysis, and then stored at 4\u00b0 C.</p>Example 3B: Binding Studies with \u03b1-Synuclein FibrilsDifferent dilutions of Conjugate A liposomes or p-FTAA were added and mixed with 5 \u03bcM of \u03b1-Synuclein fibrils and incubated for 2 hours. The mixture was centrifuged at 21000 g for 5 mins. The supernatant was removed and assayed for fluorescence of p-FTAA that was unbound to the fibrils. Excitation of 405 nm and emission of 574 nm emission was used. A standard curve from known concentrations of liposomes or pFTAA was made. The bound fraction was calculated as the difference between the total pFTAA or pFTAA-liposomes that was incubated and the unbound fraction. A dissociation constant, K<sub>d </sub>of 1.75 nM was determined for Conjugate A liposomes (FIG. 7A). A dissociation constant of 3 nM was determined for the p-FTAA molecule (FIG. 7B).</p>Example 4A: Formation of Tau FibrilsLyophilized tau-441 (2N4R) was dissolved in buffer containing 40 mM HEPES, 5 mM EGTA, 3 mM MgCl2, pH 7.5. Tau was phosphorylated with GSK-3b in the presence of 2 mM ATP at 30\u00b0 C. for 40 hours. Tau was used at 30-75 \u03bcM concentration, and GSK-3b was used at 0.02-0.08 U/pmol of tau. SDS PAGE gel was run to confirm the phosphorylation of tau (FIG. 8).</p>To make fibrils, the phosphorylated tau was reacted with arachidonic acid (ARA). The p-tau was diluted in 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT and 150 mM NaCl at pH-7.6 to final concentration of 32 \u03bcM and ARA at 37 times molar excess of tau was added. The mixture was incubated for 2 days at 37\u00b0 C. for 2 days. Fresh DTT was supplemented daily. The oligomers formed were used as seeds for fibril formation. 8 \u03bcM of tau seeds were used to form fibrils with 30 \u03bcM p-tau in 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT and 150 mM NaCl at pH-7.6. ARA was used at 37 times molar excess over p-tau monomer and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 2 days. Fresh DTT was added every day.</p>Fibril formation was monitored by monitoring Thioflavin T fluorescence. Thioflavin T is non-fluorescent molecule, but in the presence of tau aggregates, it binds to tau fibrils and exhibits fluorescence with excitation of 405 nm and emission of 535 nm.</p>Example 4B: Binding Studies with Tau FibrilsDifferent dilutions of p-FTAA molecule were added and mixed with 0.85 \u03bcM o"
