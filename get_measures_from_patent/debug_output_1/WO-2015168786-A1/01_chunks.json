    "NFa activity; or \n\n (c) a combination of a) and b), </p>is decreased in the presence of a test compound relative to in the absence of said test compound, wherein said decrease is indicative that said test compound can be used for preventing or treating a retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration comprising administering to a subject in need thereof. </p>[00105] In another aspect, the present invention concerns determining the likelihood of developing a retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration or a symptom thereof comprising administering to a subject in need thereof by detecting a genetic variation in a TNFa nucleic acid associated with an increased soluble TNFa activity or expression in a subject. </p>[00106] In another aspect, the present invention concerns a method for identifying a compound for preventing or treating a retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration-related disorder or condition or at least one symptom thereof, said method comprising determining whether: </p> (a) a level of CP-AMPAR activity; </p> (b) a level of expression of GluA2; or </p> (c) a combination of a) and b), </p>is modulated in the presence of a test compound relative to in the absence of said test compound, wherein a decrease of (a); and/or an increase of (b), is indicative that said test compound can be used for preventing or treating a retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration comprising administering to a subject in need thereof. </p>[00107] These methods can be conducted in vitro (e.g., in TNFa binding assay), in a cell or in an animal (e.g., appropriate model animal for a disease that would benefit from a decreased RGC degeneration). </p>[00108] In another embodiment of the invention, a reporter assay-based method of selecting agents which modulate soluble TNFa expression or activity is provided. The method includes providing a cell comprising a nucleic acid sequence comprising a soluble TNFa transcriptional regulatory sequence operably-l inked to a suitable reporter gene. The cell is then exposed to the agent suspected of affecting soluble TNFa expression (e.g., a test/candidate compound) and the transcription efficiency or soluble TNFa activity is measured by the activity of the reporter gene. The activity can then be compared to the activity of the reporter gene in cells unexposed to the agent in question. Suitable reporter genes include but are not limited to beta( )-D-galactosidase, luciferase, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and green fluorescent protein (GFP). Similar assay based methods are provided using instead CP-AMPAR and/or GluA2 regulatory sequence operably-l inked to a suitable reporter gene and exposing the cells to the agent suspected of affecting CP-AMPAR and/or GluA2 expression, respectively. </p>[00109] The present invention thus relates to a method for identifying a compound for preventing or \n\n treating an RGC degeneration-related disorder or condition or at least one symptom thereof, said method comprising: </p> (a) contacting a test compou"
