    "sorders, metabolic disorders and for the treatment of diabetes.</p>The compounds of the invention display pharmacological activity in the following assay designed to demonstrate MCH receptor antagonist activity. The compounds are non-toxic at pharmaceutically therapeutic doses.</p>MCH receptor binding assayMembranes from CHO cells expressing the MCH receptor were prepared by lysing cells with 5 mM HEPES for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. Cell lysates were centrifuged (12.5000 x g, 15 min) and the pellet was resuspended in 5 mM HEPES. For each 96-well plate (Microlite, Dynex Technologies), 1 mg of cell membranes were incubated with 10 mg of wheat germ agglutinin SPA beads (Amersham) for 5 min at 4\u00b0C in a volume of 10 ml of binding buffer (25 mM HEPES, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM NaCl, 5 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1% BSA). The membrane/bead mixture was centrifuged (1500 x g, 3.5 min), the supernatant was aspirated, and the pellet was resuspended in 10 ml binding buffer. The centrifugation, aspiration and resuspension were then repeated. The membrane/bead mixture (100 l) was then added to 96-well plates containing 50 \u00b5l of 500 pM [<sup>125</sup>I]-MCH (NEN) and 50 ml of the appropriate concentration of compound (4X the desired final concentration). Nonspecific binding was determined by including 1 \u00b5M MCH in the binding reaction. The binding reaction was incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Plates were then analyzed in a TOPCOUNT microplate scintillation counter (Packard). Data was analyzed and Ki values were determined using GraphPad Prim.</p>For the compounds of this invention, a range of MCH receptor binding activity (Ki values) of from about 0.5 nM to about 100 nM was observed. Compounds of this invention preferably have a binding activity in the range of from about 0.5 nM to about 50 nM, and more preferably from about 0.5 to about 10 nM.</p>The pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredient may be in a form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, com starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorpti"
