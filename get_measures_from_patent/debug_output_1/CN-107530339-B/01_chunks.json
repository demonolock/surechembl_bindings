It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other pharmaceutical excipients may be used in the present invention.</p>\"glucocorticoid\" (\"GC\") refers to a steroid hormone that binds to the glucocorticoid receptor. Glucocorticoids are generally characterized by having 12 carbon atoms, one \u03b1, \u03b2 -unsaturated ketone in ring a, an \u03b1 -ketol group attached to ring D. They differ in the degree of oxidation and the degree of hydroxylation of C-11, C-17 and C-19 (Brown, Biosynthesis and Transport of Membrane Lipids, Formation of Cholesterol Derivatives (Biosynthesis and Transport of Membrane Lipids and Formation of Cholesterol Derivatives), in Biochemistry, Daisy et al, (eds.),1989, pg.567). As used herein, \"glucocorticoids\" include a variety of compounds known in the art, referred to as follows: a glucocorticoid receptor agonist, a glucocorticoid steroid, a corticoid alcohol, a corticosteroid, or a steroid that binds to and activates a glucocorticoid receptor.</p>\"glucocorticoid receptor\" (\"GR\") refers to a type II GR that specifically binds to cortisol and/or cortisol analogs (e.g., dexamethasone) (see, e.g., Turner &amp; Muller, J Mol Endocrinol, 200535283-292). The GR is also known as the cortisol receptor. The term includes isoforms of GR, recombinant GR and mutant GR. The inhibition constant (Ki) for the type II human GR receptor (Genbank: P04150) is between 0.0001nM and 1,000 nM; preferably between 0.0005nM and 10nM, most preferably between 0.001nM and 1 nM.</p>As used herein, the term \"glucocorticoid receptor antagonist\" or \"GRA\" refers to any composition or compound that partially or completely inhibits (antagonizes) the binding of a Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) agonist (e.g., synthetic or natural cortisol or cortisol analog) to the GR. By \"specificity,\" drugs preferentially bind to GR over other nuclear receptors, such as the Mineralocorticoid Receptor (MR), the Androgen Receptor (AR), or the Progesterone Receptor (PR). Preferably, the specific glucocorticoid receptor antagonist binds to GR with 10 times its affinity for MR, AR or PR, MR and AR, AR and PR, or MR, AR and PR (1/10 for Kd). In a more preferred embodiment, the specific glucocorticoid receptor antagonist binds GR with 100 times greater affinity (1/100 of Kd) than its binding to MR, AR or PR, MR and AR, AR and PR, or MR, AR and PR.</p>As used herein, \"selective inhibitor,\" in the context of glucocorticoid receptor, refers to a compound that selectively interferes with the binding of a particular glucocorticoid receptor agonist to the glucocorticoid receptor. Herein, the term \"steroid backbone\" in glucocorticoid receptor antagonists refers to glucocorticoid receptor antagonists comprising a modified cortisol base structure, cortisol being an endogenous steroid glucocorticoid receptor ligand. The basic structure of the steroid skeleton is shown in the following general formula I:</p></p>to produce glucocorticoid antagonists, the two most well-known structural modifications of the corticosteroid backbone include: modification of the 11- \u03b2 hydroxyl group and modification of the 17- \u03b2 side chain (see, e.g., Lefebvre (1989) J. Steroid biochem.33: 557-563). As used herein, the term \"non-steroidal skeleton\" in glucocorticoid receptor antagonists refers to glucocorticoid receptor antagonists that do not have structural homology to cortisol or that do not modify cortisol. These compounds include synthetic mimetics and protein analogs of proteins, including partial peptides, pseudopeptides, and non-peptide molecular entities.</p>Non-steroidal GRA compounds also include glucocorticoid receptor antagonists having a cyclohexyl-pyrimidine backbone, a fused azadecalin backbone, a heteroarylketone fused azadecalin backbone, or an octahydro fus",
    "or administration of a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist. In some cases, the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist is a specific glucocorticoid receptor antagonist. As used herein, a \"specific glucocorticoid receptor antagonist\" refers to a composition or compound that inhibits any biological response associated with the binding of the glucocorticoid receptor to an agonist by preferentially binding to the glucocorticoid receptor and not to other Nuclear Receptors (NR). In some embodiments, the specific glucocorticoid receptor antagonist preferentially binds to the glucocorticoid receptor, but not the Mineralocorticoid Receptor (MR), Androgen Receptor (AR), or Progesterone Receptor (PR). In an exemplary embodiment, the specific glucocorticoid receptor antagonist preferentially binds to the glucocorticoid receptor and not the Mineralocorticoid Receptor (MR). In another exemplary embodiment, the specific glucocorticoid receptor antagonist preferentially binds to the glucocorticoid receptor and not the Progesterone Receptor (PR). In another exemplary embodiment, the specific glucocorticoid receptor antagonist preferentially binds to the glucocorticoid receptor and not to the Androgen Receptor (AR). In another exemplary embodiment, the specific glucocorticoid receptor antagonist preferentially binds to the glucocorticoid receptor as compared to MR and PR, MR and AR, PR and AR, or MR, PR and AR.</p>In a related embodiment, the specific glucocorticoid receptor antagonist binds to the binding constant (K) of the glucocorticoid receptor<sub>d</sub>) K to be bound to other nuclear receptors<sub>d</sub>At least 10 times lower. In another embodiment, the specific glucocorticoid receptor antagonist binds to the binding constant (K) of the glucocorticoid receptor<sub>d</sub>) Than it binds to other nuclear receptorsIn the general formula K<sub>d</sub>At least 100 times lower. In another embodiment, the specific glucocorticoid receptor antagonist binds to the binding constant (K) of the glucocorticoid receptor<sub>d</sub>) K to be bound to other nuclear receptors<sub>d</sub>At least 1000 times lower.</p>In general, treatment may be by administering an effective amount of a Glucocorticoid Receptor Antagonist (GRA) of any chemical structure or mechanism of action and a glucocorticoid of any chemical structure or mechanism of action. Such GRA categories and specific members are exemplified herein. However, one skilled in the art will readily recognize that other relevant or irrelevant GRAs may also be suitable for use in the treatment methods described herein.</p>1. GRA having steroid skeleton</p>In some embodiments, an effective dose of GRAs having a steroid backbone is administered to a subject for treating ACTH-secreting tumors. Steroidal GRAs can be obtained by modifying the basic structure of glucocorticoid agonists, i.e. various variants of the steroid skeleton. The structure of cortisol can be modified in a number of ways. Two of the most common classes of GRAs obtained by modifying the structure of the corticosteroid backbone include: modification of 11-beta hydroxyl group and modification of 17-beta side chain. (see: Lefebvre (1989) J. Steroid biochem.33: 557-563). Examples of steroid GR antagonists include androgen-type steroid compounds as described in U.S. patent 5,929,058 and compounds as described in U.S. patents 4,296,206, 4,386,085, 4,447,424, 4,477,445, 4,519,946, 4,540,686, 4,547,493, 4,634,695, 4,634,696, 4,753,932"
