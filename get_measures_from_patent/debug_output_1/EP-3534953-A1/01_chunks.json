Human antibody and B cell response to ZIKV infection. Serum samples from humans with a previous diagnosis of ZIKV infection were tested for (FIG. 1A) binding to ZIKV E protein in ELISA (with two technical replicates) and (FIG. IB) neutralization of ZIKV in a FRNT assay (performed with at least two independent repeats in triplicate). Subjects 973 and 972 sera were tested from two separate time points with similar results - these data were combined). Subject 1001 had the highest endpoint titer in the binding assay and displayed potent neutralizing activity. Subject 657 was a control without history of exposure to ZIKV. (FIG. 1C) Supernatants of EBV -transformed B cell cultures from Subject 1001 were tested for binding to ZIKV E or Dili of ZIKV E or related flavivirus E proteins to assess the specificity of the immune response. The frequency of antigen-specific cells against each viral protein was determined with a threshold optical density (OD) of 1.5; with alternate lower OD thresholds of 1.0 or 0.5, the frequency was 0.69% or 0.97% for ZIKV E, respectively. (FIG. ID) In four additional separate B cell transformation experiments, the frequency of B cells reactive with intact ZIKV E or E-FLM was determined. </p> FIG. 2A-E. Characterization of anti-ZIKV mAbs (FIG. 2A) 29 mAbs were tested in binding, neutralization, and competition binding assays. The half-maximal binding concentration (EC50) against ZIKV E and the IC50 (by focus reduction neutralization test) against H/PF/2013 strain for neutralizing antibodies (highlighted in blue) are shown. The mAbs are displayed in four groups (A, B, C, or D) based on a competition binding assay.</p>The values are the percent of binding that occurred during competition compared to uncompeted binding, which was normalized to 100% and the range of competition is indicated by the box colors. Black filled boxes indicate strongly competing pairs (residual binding &lt;30%), grey filled boxes indicate intermediate competition (residual binding 30- 69%), and white filled boxes indicate non-competing pairs (residual binding &gt; 70%). The</p>IC50 against H/PF/2013 strain for neutralizing antibodies is shown with active clones highlighted in blue. (FIG. 2B) A ribbon diagram of three protomers of ZIKV E (DI in red, DII in yellow and Dili in blue) is shown with critical residues highlighted as spheres from epitope mapping experiments for representative antibodies in each of the competition \n\n binding groups. The colors of the critical residues correspond to the competition group designation as in FIG. 2A. The mutations in the E-FLM and DIII-LR mutants are indicated by black and silver spheres, respectively. (FIG. 2C) Representative mAbs from each competition binding group are listed with the domains and residues critical for binding. (FIG. 2D) Two mAbs were tested for neutralization of five strains of ZIKV. The concentrations at which 50% or 90% neutralization occurred are listed in (FIG. 2E). The neutralization data are pooled from at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate. </p> FIGS. 3A-F. Protective activity of ZIKV-117 in adult male and pregnant female mice. (FIG. 3A) Four to five week-old WT male mice were treated with 2 mg of anti-</p>Ifnarl mAb followed by subcutaneous inoculation with 10<sup>3</sup> FFU of mouse-adapted ZIKV-Dakar. Mice were treated with a single 100 \u03bcg or 250 \u03bcg dose of isotype control mAb (hCHK-152) or ZIKV-117 on D+l or D+5 (n = 10 per group from two independent experiments), respectively. Significance was analyzed by the log-rank test (*, P &lt; 0.05; **, P &lt; 0.01",
    "e control (a cross-reactive antibody to DENV; chimeric human E60 [chE60]) and processed by flow cytometry. The data are representative of two independent experiments. The numbers in the box indicate the fraction of cells that stained positively. </p> FIG. 8. Detection of human IgG in placenta or fetal head tissues after treatment of dams with ZIKV-117 or PBS treated pregnant mice. As described in FIGS. 3A-F, WT female mice were mated with WT sires and monitored for pregnancy. At E5.5, dams were treated with anti-Ifnarl mAb and PBS or 250 \u03bcg of ZIKV-117. One day later (E6.5), dams were infected with 10<sup>3</sup> FFU of ZIKV -Dakar. Fetuses and placentas (n = 4 each) were harvested on E13.5, homogenized, and tested for human IgG by ELISA. Human antibody in tissues was captured on ELISA plates coated with ZIKV E protein and detected using goat anti -human IgG (Fc-specific) antibody. The quantity of antibody was determined by comparison with a standard curve constructed using purified ZIKV-117 in a dilution series. Concentration of ZIKV-117 detected in treated or PBS mock-treated placenta or fetal head tissues, with standard curve. Four replicates were performed for each mouse tissue; results were averaged for each mouse. The graphs represent the mean + SEM from 3 mice per group. </p> FIGS. 9A-B. Comparison of WT and LALA mutated antibodies. (FIG. 9A) Binding to recombinant human FcyRl . The functional abrogation of the binding of the LALA variant IgG was confirmed in an ELISA binding assay with recombinant human FcyRI. ZIKV-117 WT bound to FcyRI, whereas the ZIKV-117 LALA antibody did not. WT and LALA versions of another human mAb, CKV063, were used as controls. (FIG. 9B) Neutralization. ZIKV-117 WT and LALA antibodies exhibited equivalent neutralizing activity in vitro to each other and to the hybridoma-derived antibody. </p> DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS </p>As discussed above, Zika virus (ZIKV) infection causes systemic and central nervous system pathology or disease, with congenital birth defects linked to infection during pregnancy (Coyne et al , 2016). To develop candidate therapeutic agents against ZIKV, the inventors isolated a panel of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from healthy subjects with prior ZIKV infection. A subset of mAbs recognized diverse epitopes on the envelope (E) protein and exhibited potent neutralizing activity. One of the most inhibitory mAbs, ZIKV- 117, broadly neutralized infection of ZIKV strains corresponding to African, Asian, and American lineages. Epitope mapping studies revealed that ZIKV-117 recognized a quaternary \n\n epitope on the E protein dimer-dimer interface. The inventors then evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of ZIKV-117 in pregnant or non-pregnant mice. In these models, mAb treatment markedly reduced tissue pathology, placental and fetal infection, and mortality. Thus, neutralizing human mAbs can protect against maternal-fetal transmission, infection and disease, and reveal important dete",
    "l plates for 18 days before screening hybridomas for antibody production by ELISA. After fusion with HMMA2.5 myeloma cells, hybridomas producing ZIKV E-specific antibodies were cloned biologically by single-cell fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Hybridomas were expanded in post-fusion medium (ClonaCell-HY Medium E, STEMCELL Technologies) until 50% confluent in 75-cm<sup>2</sup> flasks (Corning). </p> For antibody production, cells from one 75-cm<sup>2</sup> flask were collected with a cell scraper and expanded to four 225-cm<sup>2</sup> flasks (Corning) in serum-free medium (Hybridoma- SFM, Life Technologies). After 21 days, supernatants were clarified by centrifugation and filtered using 0.45-\u03bcm pore size filter devices. HiTrap Protein G or HiTrap MabSelectSure columns (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) were used to purify antibodies from filtered supernatants. </p> Sequence analysis of antibody variable region genes. Total cellular RNA was extracted from pelleted cells from hybridoma clones, and an RT-PCR reaction was performed using mixtures of primers designed to amplify all heavy-chain or light-chain antibody variable regions (Nelson et al , 2014). The generated PCR products were purified using AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter) and sequenced directly using an ABI3700 automated DNA sequencer. The variable region sequences of the heavy and light chains were analyzed using the IMGT/V-Quest program (Brochet et al , 2008; Guidicell &amp; Lefranc, 2011). </p> ELISA and half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) binding analysis. Wells of microtiter plates were coated with purified, recombinant ectodomain of ZIKV E, Dili, Dili LRM (Dili containing A310E and T335K mutations in the lateral ridge of Dili) or Dili of related flaviviruses DENV2 or WNV and incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight. In ELISA studies with purified mAbs, the inventors used recombinant ZIKV E protein ectodomain with His6 tag produced in Sf9 insect cells (Meridian Life Sciences R01635). Plates were blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS-T for 1 hr. B cell culture supernatants or purified antibodies were added to the wells and incubated for 1 hr at ambient temperature. The bound antibodies were detected using goat anti-human IgG (y-specific) conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Southern Biotech) and pNPP disodium salt hexahydrate substrate (Sigma). In ELISAs that assessed binding of mAbs to Dili and Dili LRM, the inventors used previously described murine mAbs ZV-2 and ZV-54 (Zhao et al , 2016) as controls. A goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated \n\n with alkaline phosphatase (Southern Biotech) was used for detection of these antibodies. Color development was monitored at 405 nm in a spectrophotometer (Biotek). For determining half-maximal effective concentration binding (EC50), microtiter plates were coated with ZIKV E or E-FLM that eliminated interaction of fusion-loop specific antibodies. Purified antibodies were diluted serially and applied to the plates. Bound antibodies were detected as above. A non-linear regression analysis was performed on the resulting curves using Prism (GraphPad) to calculate EC50 values. </p> ELISA for detection of human antibodies in murine tissues. Fetal head and placental tissues were collected at E13.5 from groups treated with ZIKV-117 or PBS (as a negative control), homogenized in PBS (250 \u03bcl) and stored at -20\u00b0C. ELISA plates were coated with ZIKV E protein, and thawed, clarified tissue homogenates were applied undiluted in triplicate. Bound antibodies were detected using goat anti-human IgG (Fc-specific) antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. The quantity of antibody was determined by comparison with a standard curve constructed using purified ZIKV-117 in a dilution series. </p> Biolayer interferometry competition binding assay. His6-tagged ZIKV E protein was immobilized on anti-His coated biosensor tips (Pall) for 2 min on an Octet Red biosensor instrument. After measuring the baseline signal in kinetics buffer (PBS, 0.01 % BSA, and 0.002% Tween 20) for 1 min, biosensor tips were immersed into the wells containing first antibody at a concentration of 10 \u03bcg/ml for 7 min. Biosensors then were immersed into wells containing a second mAb at a concentration of 10 \u03bcg/ml for 7 min. The signal obtained for binding of the second antibody in the presence of the first antibody was expressed as a percent of the uncompeted binding of the second antibody that was derived independently. The antibodies were considered competing if the presence of first antibody reduced the signal of the second antibody to less than 30% of its maximal binding and non-competing if the signal was greater than 70%. A level of 30 -70% was considered intermediate competition. </p> Shotgun mutagenesis epitope mapping. Epitope mapping was performed by shotgun mutagenesis essentially as described previously (Davidson &amp; Doranz, 2014. A ZIKV prM/E protein expression construct (strain ZikaSPH2015) was subjected to high-throughput alanine scanning mutagenesis to generate a comprehensive mutation library. Each residue within prM/E was changed to alanine, with alanine codons mutated to serine. In total, 672 ZIKV prM/E mutants were generated (100% coverage), sequence confirmed, and arrayed into 384-well plates. Each ZIKV prM/E m",
    "temperature and permeabilized with HBSS supplemented with 10 mM HEPES, 0.1% saponin and 0.025% NaN3 for 10 min at room temperature. Fifty -thousand cells were transferred to U-bottom plates and incubated for 30 min at 4\u00b0C with 5 \u03bcg/ml of anti-ZIKV human mAbs or negative (hCHK-152)<sup>12</sup>; or positive (hE60) (Williams et al, 2013) isotype controls. After washing, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Invitrogen) at 1 :500, fixed in 1% PFA in PBS, processed on MACSQuant Analyzed (Miltenyi Biotec), and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star). </p> Recombinant antibody expression and purification. Total RNA was extracted from hybridoma cells and genes encoding the VH and VL domains were amplified in RT-PCR using IgExp primers (Thornburg et al, 2016). The PCR products were directly cloned into antibody expression vectors containing the constant domains of WT gammal chain, LALA mutant (a leucine (L) to alanine (A) substitution at positions 234 and 235) gammal chain for the VH domains, and WT kappa chain for the VL domain in an isothermal amplification reaction (Gibson reaction) (Gibson et al, 2009). Plasmids encoding the heavy and light chain were transfected into 293F cells and full length recombinant IgG was secreted into transfected cell supematants. Supematants were collected and IgG purified using Protein G chromatography and eluted into PBS. The functional abrogation of the binding of the LALA variant IgG was confirmed in an ELISA binding assay with recombinant human FcyRI. The \n\n binding of ZIKV-117 WT or LALA antibody to FcyRI was evaluated, in comparison with the binding pattern of control antibodies (human mAb CKV063 (Fong et al , 2014) LALA mutated IgG). </p> Adult mouse lethal protection experiments. C57BL/6J male mice (4 to 5 week-old, Jackson Laboratories) were inoculated with 10<sup>3</sup> FFU of mouse-adapted ZIKV Dakar by subcutaneous route in the footpad. One-day prior to infection, mice were treated with 2 mg anti-Ifnarl mAb (MAR1-5A3, Leinco Technologies) by intraperitoneal injection. ZIKV- specific human mAb (ZIKV-117) or an isotype control (hCHK-152) was administered as a single dose at day +1 (100 \u03bcg) or day +5 (250 \u03bcg) after infection via an intraperitoneal route. Animals were monitored for 21 days. </p> Pregnant mouse protection experiments. WT C57BL/6J mice were bred in a specific pathogen-free facility at Washington University School of Medicine. WT dams, prophylaxis studies. WT female and male mice were mated; at embryonic days E5.5, dams were treated with a single 250 \u03bcg dose of ZIKV mAb or isotype control by intraperitoneal injection as well as a 1 mg injection of anti-Ifnarl (MAR1-5A3). At E6.5, mice were inoculated with 10<sup>3</sup> FFU of mouse-adapted ZIKV Dakar 41519 by subcutaneous injection in the footpad. At E7.5, dams received a second 1 mg dose of anti-Ifnarl via an intraperitoneal route. WT dams, therapy. WT female and male mice were mated; at embryonic days E5.5, ",
    " of a contemporary Asian isolate (H/PF/2013) \n\n from French Polynesia (FIGS. 1A-B). The inventors studied the B cells of Subject 1001 in detail. The frequency of B cells secreting antibodies to ZIKV E protein in the peripheral blood of Subject 1001 was 0.61 % (FIG. 1 C), when a threshold for detection of binding [absorbance at 405 nm (A405)] of 1.5 was used. They also tested the reactivity of antibodies with domain III (Dili) of the E protein from ZIKV, or the related dengue (DENV) or West Nile (WNV) viruses. Most of the ZIKV E reactive antibodies did not bind to Dili, and of those binding to Dili, most were ZIKV-specific (FIG. 1C). In a replicate of the assay performed with another aliquot of cells from the same subject (FIG. ID), the frequency of ZIKV E-reactive B cell was 0.36%. Comparative binding to a WT ZIKV E or mutant (E- FLM) protein lacking the conserved fusion loop epitope in DII showed immunodominance (binding ~ 70% of mAbs) of the fusion loop. </p> The inventors obtained 32 stable cloned hybridomas secreting antibodies that bound to ZIKV E protein from the cells of three donors (mAb ZIKV-195 from Subject 101 1, mAbs ZIKV-204 and ZIKV-216 from Subject 973, and the remaining 29 mAbs from Subject 1001). All except one mAb belonged to IgGl isotype, with an equal distribution of light chain isotypes (FIG. 2A). Sanger sequencing of cDNA of the antibody variable gene regions revealed that each mAb represented an independently derived clone. The inventors determined the half maximal effective concentration for binding (EC50) to ZIKV E protein (FIGS. 2A and FIG. 5); most of the mAbs bound to E protein at low concentrations, with EC50 values generally below 100 ng/ml. Six of the 32 mAbs exhibited neutralizing activity, with FRNT50 values in the range of 0.9 to 420 ng/ml. They next determined how many antigenic sites were recognized by members of the panel using quantitative competition binding to ZIKV E protein. The inventors identified four major competition groups (designated A, B, C or D). Antibodies belonging to the largest group, Group A with 24 members, were directed against the fusion loop in DII as determined from the disparate binding patterns to E, Dili, or to E-FLM (FIG. 5). This group of fusion loop specific mAbs had a single neutralizing clone (ZIKV-88), with moderate potency. Group B mAbs (ZIKV- 116 and ZIKV- 161) neutralized ZIKV infection and bound to E, Dili, and E-FLM. Group C mAbs (ZIKV- 19 and ZIKV- 190) bound to E and E-FLM weakly, but did not potently neutralize infection. Group D mAbs ZIKV-195 and ZIKV-216 neutralized with moderate potency and were similar in binding to both E and E-FLM. The most potently inhibitory Group D mAb, ZIKV-117, bound to both E and E-FLM weakly. One antibody (ZIKV-216) competed with members of both Groups C and D and neutralized with moderate potency. \n\n The inventors mapped the epitopes of representative mAbs from each competition group using a complete shotgun mutagenesis library (Davidson &amp; Doranz, 2014) of ZIKV prM/E (Brazil Paraiba 2015 strain) protein variants in which each residue was changed individually to alanine (FIG. 2B and FIGS. 6A-C)."
