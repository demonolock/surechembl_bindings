    "GS IgG-IL-2 is more effective than high dose Proleukin in T<sub>reg </sub>induction in cynomolgus monkeys. Normal healthy cynomolgus monkeys (groups of n=5) were treated with low doses of DP47GS IgG-IL-2 or high doses of Proleukin and the change in regulatory T cells tested at day 10. On days 0 and 7, DP47GS IgG-IL-2 was given SC at a dose of 16,800 IU/kg. Proleukin treatment was given SC 3 times per week (MWF) for a total of 5 doses at 200,000 IU/kg. The results are shown as mean\u00b1SEM for the change in total T<sub>reg</sub>s per mm<sup>3 </sup>blood (A), the fold increase in T<sub>reg</sub>s (B), and the change in the ratio of T<sub>reg</sub>s to conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> FoxP3<sup>\u2212</sup> cells (C).

For clarity, the individual peptide chains of the immunoglobulin component of the fusion protein may be linked non-covalently, e.g. by disulfide bonds.</p>\u201cFused\u201d refers to components that are linked by peptide bonds, either directly or via one or more peptide linkers.</p>By \u201cspecific binding\u201d is meant that the binding is selective for the antigen and can be discriminated from unwanted or non-specific interactions. The ability of an immunoglobulin to bind to a specific antigen can be measured either through an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or other techniques familiar to one of skill in the art, e.g. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) technique (analyzed on a BIAcore instrument) (Liljebiad et al., Glyco J 17, 323-329 (2000)), and traditional binding assays (Heeley, Endocr Res 28, 217-229 (2002)). In one embodiment, the extent of binding of an immunoglobulin to an unrelated protein is less than about 10% of the binding of the immunoglobulin to the antigen as measured, e.g. by SPR. In certain embodiments, an immunoglobulin that binds to the antigen has a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of \u22641 \u03bcM, \u2264100 nM, \u226410 nM, \u22641 nM, \u22640.1 nM, \u22640.01 nM, or \u22640.001 nM (e.g. 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M or less, e.g. from 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M to 10<sup>\u221213 </sup>M, e.g. from 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>M to 10<sup>\u221213 </sup>M).</p>\u201cAffinity\u201d or \u201cbinding affinity\u201d refers to the strength of the sum total of non-covalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g. an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g. an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, \u201cbinding affinity\u201d refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1:1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g. antibody and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>), which is the ratio of dissociation and association rate constants (k<sub>off </sub>and k<sub>on</sub>, respectively). Thus, equivalent affinities may comprise different rate constants, as long as the ratio of the rate constants remains the same. Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art, including those described herein. A particular method for measuring affinity is Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR).</p>\u201cReduced binding\u201d, for example reduced binding to an Fe receptor, refers to a decrease in affinity for the respective interaction, as measured for example by SPR. For clarity the term includes also reduction of the affinity to zero (or below the detection limit of the analytic method), i.e. complete abolishment of the interaction. Conversely, \u201cincreased binding\u201d refers to an increase in binding affinity for the respective interaction.</p>As used herein, the term \u201cantigenic determinant\u201d is synonymous with \u201cantigen\u201d and refers to a site (e.g. a contiguous stretch of amino acids or a conformational configuration made up of different regions of non-contiguous amino acids) on a polypeptide macromolecule to which an antibody binds, forming an antibody-antigen complex. Useful antigenic determinants can be found, for example, on the surfaces of cells, free in blood serum, and/or in the extracellular matrix (ECM).</p>As used herein, the term \u201csingle-chain\u201d refers to a molecule comprising amino acid monomers linearly linked by pepti",
    "e instrument (GE Healthcare) and Fc receptors such as may be obtained by recombinant expression. A specific illustrative and exemplary embodiment for measuring binding affinity is described in the following. According to one embodiment, Binding affinity to an Fc receptor is measured by surface plasmon resonance using a BIACORE\u00ae T100 machine (GE Healthcare) at 25\u00b0 C. with ligand (Fc receptor) immobilized on CM5 chips. Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, GE Healthcare) are activated with N-ethyl-N\u2032-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Recombinant ligand is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5, to 0.5-30 \u03bcg/ml before injection at a flow rate of 10 \u03bcl/min to achieve approximately 100-5000 response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of the ligand, 1 M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, three- to five-fold serial dilutions of antibody (range between \u02dc0.01 nM to 300 nM) are injected in RBS-EP+ (GE Healthcare, 10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.05% Surfactant P20, pH 7.4) at 25\u00b0 C. at a flow rate of approximately 30-50 \u03bcl/min. Association rates (k<sub>on</sub>) and dissociation rates (k<sub>off</sub>) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIACORE\u00ae T100 Evaluation Software version 1.1.1) by simultaneously fitting the association and dissociation sensorgrams. The equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) is calculated as the ratio k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>. See, e.g., Chen et al., J Mol Biol 293, 865-881 (1999). Alternatively, binding affinity antibodies to Fc receptors may be evaluated using cell lines known to express particular Fc receptors, such as NK cells expressing Fc\u03b3IIIa receptor.</p>In one embodiment, the modification comprises one or more amino acid mutation that reduces the binding affinity of the immunoglobulin to an Fc receptor. In one embodiment the amino acid mutation is an amino acid substitution. Typically, the same one or more amino acid mutation is present in each of the two immunoglobulin heavy chains. In one embodiment said amino acid mutation reduces the binding affinity of the immunoglobulin to the Fc receptor by at least 2-fold, at least 5-fold, or at least 10-fold. In embodiments where there is more than one amino acid mutation that reduces the binding affinity of the immunoglobulin to the Fc receptor, the combination of these amino acid mutations may reduce the binding affinity of the immunoglobulin to the Fc receptor by at least 10-fold, at least 20-fold, or even at least 50-fold. In one embodiment said immunoglobulin molecule exhibits less than 20%, particularly less than 10%, more particularly less than 5% of the binding affinity to an Fc receptor as compared to a corresponding immunoglobulin molecule without said modification.</p>In one embodiment, said Fc receptor is an activating Fc receptor. In a spe",
    " embodiment, said IL-2 \u03b1 receptor is human IL-2 \u03b1 receptor. A method for measuring binding affinity to IL-2 \u03b2\u03b3 or IL-2 \u03b1 receptor by SPR is described herein. According to one embodiment, binding affinity (K<sub>D</sub>) is measured by surface plasmon resonance using a BIACORE\u00ae T100 machine (GE Healthcare) at 25\u00b0 C. with IL-2 receptors immobilized on CM5 chips. Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, GE Healthcare) are activated with N-ethyl-N\u2032-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Recombinant IL-2 receptor is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5, to 0.5-30 \u03bcg/ml before injection at a flow rate of 10 \u03bcl/minute to achieve approximately 200-1000 (for IL-2R \u03b1) or 500-3000 (for IL-2R \u03b2\u03b3 heterodimer) response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of IL-2 receptor, 1 M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, three-fold serial dilutions of fusion protein (range between \u02dc3 nM to 300 nM) are injected, in HBS-EP+ (GE Healthcare, 10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.05% Surfactant P20, pH 7.4) at 25\u00b0 C. at a flow rate of approximately 30 \u03bcl/min. Association rates (k<sub>on</sub>) and dissociation rates (k<sub>off</sub>) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIACORE\u00ae T100 Evaluation Software version 1.1.1) by simultaneously fitting the association and dissociation sensorgrams. The equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) is calculated as the ratio k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>. See, e.g., Chen et al., J Mol Biol 293, 865-881 (1999).</p>In a particular aspect, the invention provides a fusion protein comprising (i) an IgG<sub>1</sub>-subclass immunoglobulin molecule comprising the amino acid substitutions L234A, L235A and P329G (EU numbering) in the immunoglobulin heavy chains, and (ii) two interleukin-2 (IL-2) molecules, each fused at its N-terminal amino acid to the C-terminal amino acid of one of the immunoglobulin heavy chains through a peptide linker. In a specific embodiment, said immunoglobulin molecule comprises the heavy chain variable region sequence of SEQ ID NO: 9 and the light chain variable region sequence of SEQ ID NO: 11. In a further specific embodiment, said IL-2 molecules each comprise the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3, In an even more specific embodiment, said fusion protein comprises a polypeptide sequence that is at least about 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% identical to the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 17, and a polypeptide sequence that is at least about 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% identical to the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 19.</p>As shown in the Examples, the fusion protein of the invention can be used to selectively activate regulatory T cells (i.e. essentially without concomitant activation of other T cell subsets and/or NK cells). Thus, the invention particularly provides the fusion protein for us",
    "less, particularly about 0.1 ng/mL or less. In another embodiment, said use is in vivo and said fusion protein is used at a dose of about 20 \u03bcg/kg body weight or less, particularly about 12 \u03bcg/kg body weight or less (wherein \u201cbody weight\u201d refers to the body weight of the individual to whom the fusion protein is administered).</p>The invention also provides a method for selective activation of regulatory T cells in vitro or in vivo, comprising contacting said regulatory T cells with the fusion protein of the invention. In one embodiment, said method further comprises contacting other (non-regulatory) T cells with said fusion protein. In one embodiment, said activation comprises induction of proliferation and/or induction of IL-2 receptor signaling. In one embodiment, said method is in vitro and said fusion protein is used at a concentration of about 1 ng/mL or less, particularly about 0.1 ng/mL or less. In another embodiment, said method is in vivo and said fusion protein is used at a dose of about 20 \u03bcg/kg body weight or less, particularly about 12 \u03bcg/kg body weight or less (wherein \u201cbody weight\u201d refers to the body weight of the individual to whom the fusion protein is administered).</p>According to certain embodiments of the use or method described in the preceding paragraphs, said activation comprises induction of proliferation and/or induction of IL-2 receptor signaling. Induction of proliferation can be measured e.g. by detection of the intracellular proliferation marker Ki-67, as described in the Examples. In one embodiment, proliferation of regulatory T cells activated by the fusion protein of the invention is increased at least about 1.5-fold, at least about 2-fold, or at least about 3-fold, as compared to proliferation of non-activated regulatory T cells. In one embodiment, proliferation of other (non-regulatory) T cells and/or NK cells contacted with the fusion protein of the invention is increased less than about 1.5 fold, less than about 1.2 fold, or less than about 1.1 fold, as compared to proliferation of corresponding cells not contacted with said fusion protein. Induction of IL-2 receptor signaling can be measured e.g. by detection of phosphorylated STAT5, as described in the Examples. In one embodiment, IL-2 receptor signaling in regulatory T cells activated by the fusion protein of the invention is increased at least about 1.5-fold, at least about 2-fold, at least about 3-fold, or at least about 5-fold, as compared to IL-2 receptor signaling in non-activated regulatory T cells. In one embodiment, IL-2 receptor signaling in other (non-regulatory) T cells and/or NK cells contacted with the fusion protein or the invention is increased less than about 1.5 fold, or less than about 1.2 fold, or less than about 1.1 fold, as compared to IL-2 receptor signaling in corresponding cells not contacted with said fusion protein.</p>PolynucleotidesThe invention further provides polynucleotides encoding a fusion as described herein or a fragment ",
    "T<sub>reg</sub>s vs. NK cells increases the preference for T<sub>reg </sub>activation several fold.</p>Induction of pSTAT5a in Cynomolgus Peripheral Blood Cell SubsetsAs observed in human peripheral blood, there is a preferential induction of pSTAT5a in T<sub>reg </sub>subsets in cynomolgus peripheral blood stimulated with DP47GS IgG-IL-2. In a direct comparison of the ability of DP47GS IgG-(IL-2)<sub>2 </sub>and DP47GS IgG-IL-2 to induce pSTAT5a in the three T<sub>reg </sub>subsets, 2-8 fold less DP47GS IgG-(IL-2), was required to reach 50% of the maximal phosphorylation level (Table 3).</p>Similar to human whole blood, cell surface and intracellular markers were used to identify regulatory T cell subsets and conventional T cells in whole blood from normal healthy cynomolgus monkeys. Blood samples were collected on the same day from three healthy cynomolgus monkeys in sodium heparin tubes and various concentrations of DP47GS IgG-IL-2 or DP47GS IgG-(IL-2)<sub>2 </sub>were added to 500 \u03bcl of blood and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. After 10 min at 37\u00b0 C., samples were lysed and fixed with pre-warmed BD Lyse/Fix buffer (BD Biosciences). After washing, cells were permeabilized with 1 mL methanol for 30 min on ice. Samples were washed 3 times and stained with a panel of FoxP3-Alexa Fluor\u00ae 647 (clone: 259D, BioLegend), CD4-V500 (clone: L200, BD Biosciences), CD45RA-V450 (clone: 5H9, BD Biosciences), CD25-PE (clone: 4E3, eBioscience), pSTAT5a-Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 (clone: 47, BD Biosciences), and Ki-67-PerCP-Cy5.5 (clone: B56, BID Biosciences) for 1 hour at 4\u00b0 C. All the samples were acquired by an LSRFortessa cell analyser (Becton Dickinson) and then analysed with FlowJo software (Tree star, Inc., Ashland, USA).</p>Table 3 summarizes the EC<sub>50 </sub>values for pSTAT5a activation by DP47GS IgG-IL-2 vs. DP47GS IgG-(IL-2)<sub>2 </sub>in the different cell subsets.</p>TABLE 3Induction of pSTAT5a in cynomolgus peripheral blood cell subsetsin response to DP47GS IgG4L-2 and DP47GS IgG-(IL-2)<sub>2</sub>.T cellIgG-IL-2IgG-(IL-2)<sub>2</sub>activated T<sub>reg</sub>0.070 ng/mL0.020 ng/mLmemory T<sub>reg</sub>0.210 ng/mL0.025 ng/mLna\u00efve T<sub>reg</sub>0.040 ng/mL0.020 ng/mLmemory T<sub>conv</sub>&gt;0.400 ng/mL\u2009\u2009&gt;0.100 ng/mL\u2009\u2009</p>Induction of T<sub>reg </sub>Number in Cynomolgus MonkeysCynomolgus animals treated in vivo with DP47GS IgG-IL-2 had dose-dependent increases in the absolute number of T<sub>reg</sub>s as well as the fold increase above baseline 7 days post dosing (FIGS. 9A and 9B, respectively). Normal healthy cynomolgus monkeys of both sexes at ages ranging from 3 to 6 years were used in all tests and no animal was used more than once. While under anaesthesia, various doses of DP47GS (n=6) or vehicle (n=3) were injected SC on the lateral dorsum. Individual doses of DP47GS IgG-IL-2 were based on body weight and formulated for injection in a vehicle of sterile PBS pH 7.2 containing 0.5% sterile cynomolgus serum. Blood samples were collected at various times pos",
    " monitored by measuring pSTAT5a levels ex vivo at various times after dosing cynomolgus monkeys or mice. The in vivo response of all cell populations that can be monitored in vitro (FIGS. 5-7) can be examined ex vivo.</p>One and 3 days after in vivo administration of a single low dose of DP47GS IgG-IL-2 (12 \u03bcg/kg) to healthy cynomolgus monkeys whole blood was collected and tested for STAT5 phosphorylation as described above (experimental procedures to Table 3). Each monkey was bled on day 0 before treatment and the amount of STAT5 phosphorylation was measured and used individually to assess fold-changes post treatment. The fold change in pSTAT5 in T<sub>reg</sub>s on days 1 and 3 is shown in FIG. 12A, the fold change in pSTAT5 in conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> CD45<sup>\u2212</sup> memory T cells in FIG. 12B, and the fold change in pSTAT5 in na\u00efve T cells is in FIG. 12C.</p>Cynomolgus blood cells obtained one and three days after a single low dose of DP47GS IgG-IL-2 (12 \u03bcg/kg) showed preferential pSTAT5a increases in T<sub>reg </sub>cells as compared to na\u00efve and memory conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (FIG. 12).</p>The increase in T<sub>reg </sub>cells in the peripheral blood after low dose IL-2 treatment could reflect a change in the distribution of the cells in the body rather than an actual increase of the cells. To substantiate that Treg increases in vivo are at least in part due to the induction of cell division by IL-2 treatment, the intracellular marker of proliferation Ki-67 was assessed. Ki-67 is a protein that can be detected in the nucleus during G<sub>1</sub>, S, G<sub>2</sub>, and mitosis but is absent from resting cells that are in the G<sub>0 </sub>phase of the cell cycle. The cynomolgus monkeys treated with DP47GS IgG-IL-2 as described above (FIG. 12) were also monitored for ex vivo changes in the intracellular marker Ki-67 as described above (experimental procedures to Table 3) to assess the extent of proliferation in vivo. The percentage of cells that were in cell cycle (Ki-67<sup>+</sup>) on day 0 was compared to the percentage of cells Ki-67<sup>+</sup> at 2 and 7 days post treatment. Ki-67<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub>s are shown in FIG. 13A, conventional CD4<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>\u2212</sup> memory T cells are in FIG. 13B, and na\u00efe CD4<sup>+</sup>CD45RA<sup>+</sup> T cells are in FIG. 13C. Cynomolgus blood cells obtained two and seven days after a single low dose of DP47GS IgG-IL-2 (12 \u03bcg/kg) showed preferential Ki-67 increases in T<sub>reg </sub>cells as compared to na\u00efve and memory conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (FIG. 13).</p>Pharmacokinetic Properties of DP47GS IgG-IL-2Prior to beginning functional studies in mice, the pharmacokinetic properties of the immunoconjugate DP47 IgG-IL-2 were compared to those of Proleukin (Novartis) (FIG. 14).</p>NOD mice were injected IP or SC with the indicated doses of DP47GS IgG-IL-2 or Proleukin in PBS containing 0.5% mouse serum and bled at various times after the injections. Doses of DP47GS IgG-IL-2 are summarized in Table 4. Human IL-2 was assessed in serum samples using mouse anti-human IL-2 mAb, BD Pharmingen, Cat #555051, clone 5344.111 to coat 96-well plates to capture the IL-2. IL-2 was detected using biotinylated mouse anti-human IL-2 mAb, BD Pharmingen, Cat #555040, clone B33-2. Binding was visualized using Europium-conjugated streptavidin.</p>As described previously, Proleukin is cleared rapidly. In contrast, DP47GS IgG-IL-2 is cleared much more slowly. Results from comparing the PK of DP47GS IgG-IL-2 in normal mice and CD25KO scid mice support the hypothesis that a major component driving the in vivo clearance of DP47GS IgG-IL-2 is the high affinity IL-2 receptor (data not shown).</p>TABLE 4Doses of DP47GS IgG-IL-2 for PK study shown inFIG. 14.IgG-IL2IgG-IL2IU/25 gmg/kg105,0003.010,5000.34,0000.1141,0000.02863000.0086</p>Foxp3 and CD25 MFI Increase in T<sub>reg</sub>s After Treatment with IgG-IL-2To compare the abilities of the i"
