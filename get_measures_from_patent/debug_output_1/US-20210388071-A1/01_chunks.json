    " Accordingly, a correlation has been observed between density of microvessels in tumor sections and patient survival in breast cancer as well as in several other tumors (Weidner, N., et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 324 (1991) 1-8; Horak, E. R., et al., Lancet 340 (1992) 1120-1124; and Macchiarini, P., et al., Lancet 340 (1992) 145-146).</p>ANG-2 and Anti-ANG-2 AntibodiesHuman angiopoietin-2 (ANG-2) (alternatively abbreviated with ANGPT2 or ANG2) (SEQ ID No: 107) is described in Maisonpierre, P. C., et al., Science 277 (1997) 55-60 and Cheung, A. H., et al, Genomics 48 (1998) 389-91. The angiopoietins-1 and -2 (ANG-1(SEQ ID No: 108) and ANG-2 (SEQ ID No: 107) were discovered as ligands for the Ties, a family of tyrosine kinases that is selectively expressed within the vascular endothelium. Yancopoulos, G. D., et al., Nature 407 (2000) 242-48. There are now four definitive members of the angiopoietin family.</p>Angiopoietin-3 and -4 (Ang-3 and Ang-4) may represent widely diverged counterparts of the same gene locus in mouse and man. Kim, I., et al., FEBS Let, 443 (1999) 353-56; Kim, I., et al., J Biol Chem 274 (1999), 26523-28. ANG-1 and ANG-2 were originally identified in tissue culture experiments as agonist and antagonist, respectively (see for ANG-1: Davies, S., et al., Cell, 87 (1996) 1161-1169; and for ANG-2: Maisonpierre, P. C., et al., Science 277 (1997) 55-60). All of the known angiopoietins bind primarily to Tie2, and both Ang-1 and -2 bind to Tie2 with an affinity of 3 nM (Kd). Maisonpierre, P. C., et al., Science 277 (1997) 55-60. Ang-1 was shown to support EC survival and to promote endothelium integrity, Davis, S., et al., Cell, 87 (1996) 1161-1169; Kwak, H. J., et al., FEBS Lett 448 (1999) 249-53; Suri, C., et al., Science 282 (1998) 468-71; Thurston, G., et al., Science 286 (1999) 2511-14; Thurston, G., et al., Nat. Med. 6 (2000) 460-63, whereas ANG-2 had the opposite effect and promoted blood vessel destabilization and regression in the absence of the survival factors VEGF or basic fibroblast growth factor. Maisonpierre, P. C., et al., Science 277 (1997) 55-60. However, many studies of ANG-2 function have suggested a more complex situation. ANG-2 might be a complex regulator of vascular remodeling that plays a role in both vessel sprouting and vessel regression. Supporting such roles for ANG-2, expression analyses reveal that ANG-2 is rapidly induced, together with VEGF, in adult settings of angiogenic sprouting, whereas ANG-2 is induced in the absence of VEGF in settings of vascular regression. Holash, J., et al., Science 284 (1999) 1994-98; Holash, J., et al., Oncogene 18 (1999) 5356-62. Consistent with a context-dependent role, ANG-2 specifically binds to the same endothelial-specific receptor, Tie-2, which is activated by Ang-1, but has context-dependent effects on its activation. Maisonpierre, P.C., et al., Science 277 (1997) 55-60.</p>Corneal angiogenesis assays have shown that both ANG-1 and ANG-2 had similar effects, acting synerg",

The wells were washed three times with 300 \u03bcl PBST (0.2% Tween\u00ae 20) and bound antibody was detected with 100 \u03bcL/well 0.1 \u03bcg/ml F(ab\u2032) &lt;hk&gt;POD (Biozol Cat. No. 206005) in 2% BSA 0.1% Tween\u00ae 20 as detection antibody for 1 h on a microtiterplate shaker at room temperature. Unbound detection antibody was washed away three times with 300 \u03bcL/well PBST and the bound detection antibody was detected by addition of 100 \u03bcL ABTS/well. Determination of absorbance was performed on a Tecan Fluor Spectrometer at a measurement wavelength of 405 nm (reference wavelength 492 nm).</p>ANG-2 Binding BIACOREBinding of the antibodies to the antigen e.g. human ANG-2 were investigated by surface plasmon resonance using a BIACORE T100 instrument (GE Healthcare Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Briefly, for affinity measurements goat&lt;hIgG-Fcgamma&gt; polyclonal antibodies were immobilized on a CM4 chip via amine coupling for presentation of the antibodies against human ANG-2. Binding was measured in HBS buffer (HBS-P (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween\u00ae 20, ph 7.4), 25\u00b0 C. Purified ANG-2-His (R&amp;D systems or in house purified) was added in various concentrations between 0.41 nM and 200 nM in solution. Association was measured by an ANG-2-injection of 3 minutes; dissociation was measured by washing the chip surface with HBS buffer for 5 minutes and a KD value was estimated using a 1:1 Langmuir binding model. Due to heterogenity of the ANG-2 preparation no 1:1 binding could be observed; KD values are thus only relative estimations. Negative control data (e.g. buffer curves) were subtracted from sample curves for correction of system intrinsic baseline drift and for noise signal reduction. Biacore\u00ae T100 Evaluation Software version 1.1.1 was used for analysis of sensorgrams and for calculation of affinity data. Alternatively, Ang-2 could be captured with a capture level of 2000-1700 RU via a PentaHisAntibody (PentaHis-Ab BSA-free, Qiagen No. 34660) that was immobilized on a CM5 chip via amine coupling (BSA-free) (see below).</p>Inhibition of huANG-2 binding to Tie-2 (ELISA)</p>The interaction ELISA was performed on 384 well microtiter plates (MicroCoat, DE, Cat.

Absorbance was measured at 405 nm.</p>Generation of HEK293-Tie2 Cell LineIn order to determine the interference of Angiopoietin-2 antibodies with ANGPT2 stimulated Tie2 phosphorylation and binding of ANGPT2 to Tie2 on cells a recombinant HEK293-Tie cell line was generated. Briefly, a pcDNA3 based plasmid (RB22-pcDNA3 Topo hTie2) coding for full-length human Tie2 (SEQ ID 61) under control of a CMV promoter and a Neomycin resistance marker was transfected using FuGENE\u00ae (Roche Applied Science) as transfection reagent into HEK293 cells (ATCC\u00ae) and resistant cells were selected in DMEM 10% FCS, 500 \u03bcg/ml G418. Individual clones were isolated via a cloning cylinder, and subsequently analyzed for Tie2 expression by FACS. Clone 22 was identified as clone with high and stable Tie2 expression even in the absence of G418 (HEK293-Tie2 clone22). HEK293-Tie2 clone22 was subsequently used for cellular assays: ANGPT2 induced Tie2 phosphorylation and ANGPT2 cellular ligand binding assay.</p>ANGPT2 Induced Tie2 Phosphorylation AssayInhibition of ANGPT2 induced Tie2 phosphorylation by ANGPT2 antibodies was measured according to the following assay principle. HEK293-Tie2 clone22 was stimulated with ANGPT2 for 5 minutes in the absence or presence of ANGPT2 antibody and P-Tie2 was quantified by a sandwich ELISA. Briefly, 2\u00d7105 HEK293-Tie2 clone 22 cells per well were grown over night on a Poly-D-Lysine coated 96 well-microtiter plate in 100 \u03bcl DMEM, 10% FCS, 500 \u03bcg/ml Geneticin. The next day a titration row of ANGPT2 antibodies was prepared in a microtiter plate (4-fold concentrated, 75 \u03bcl final volume/well, duplicates) and mixed with 75 \u03bcl of an ANGPT2 (R&amp;D systems #623-AN] dilution (3.2 \u03bcg/ml as 4-fold concentrated solution). Antibodies and ANGPT2 were pre-incubated for 15 min at room temperature. 100 \u03bcl of the mix were added to the HEK293-Tie2 clone 22 cells (pre-incubated for 5 min with 1 mM NaV3O4, Sigma #S6508) and incubated for 5 min at 37\u00b0 C. Subsequently, cells were washed with 200 \u03bcl ice-cold PBS+1 mM NaV3O4 per well and lysed by addition of 120 \u03bcl lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 10% glycerol, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM NaV3O4, 1 mM PMSF and 10 \u03bcg/ml Aprotinin) per well on ice. Cells were lysed for 30 min at 4\u00b0 C. on a microtiter plate shaker and 100 \u03bcl lysate were transferred directly into a p-Tie2 ELISA microtiter plate (R&amp;D Systems, R&amp;D #DY990) without previous centrifugation and without total protein determination. P-Tie2 amounts were quantified according to the manufacturer's instructions and IC50 values for inhibition were determined using XLfit4 analysis plug-in for Excel (Dose-response one site, model 205). IC50 values can be compared within on experiment but might vary from experiment to experiment.</p>ANGPT1 Induced Tie2 Phosphorylation AssayInhibition of ANGPT1 induced Tie2 phosphorylation by ANGPT1 antibodies was measured according to the following assay principle. HEK293-Tie2 clone22 was stimulated with ANGPT1 for 5 minutes in the absence or presence of ANGPT1 antibody and P-Tie2 was quantified by a sandwich ELISA. Briefly, 2\u00d7105 HEK293-Tie2 clone 22 cells per well were grown over night on a Poly-D-Lysine coated 96 well-microtiter plate in 100 \u03bcl DMEM, 10% FCS, 500 \u03bcg/ml Geneticin. The next day a titration row of ANGPT1 antibodies was prepared in a microtiter plate (4-fold concentrated, 75 \u03bcl final volume/well, duplicates) and mixed with 75 \u03bcl of an ANGPT1 (R&amp;D systems #923-AN] dilution (0.8 \u03bcg/ml as 4-fold concentrated solution). Antibodies and ANGPT1 were pre-incubated for 15 min at room temperature. 100 \u03bcl of the mix were added to the HEK293-Tie2 clone 22 cells (pre-incubated for 5 min with 1 mM NaV3O4, Sigma #S6508) and incubated for 5 min at 37\u00b0 C.

The heavy chain and the kappa light was cloned in a genomic expression cassette, whereas the lambda light chain was cloned as cDNA with intron A (FIG. 1B). The plasmids were amplified in E. coli, purified, and subsequently transfected for transient expression of recombinant proteins in HEK293-F cells (utilizing Invitrogen's FreeStyle\u2122 293 system). After 7 days, HEK 293-F cell supernatants were harvested, filtered and the antibodies were purified by protein A and size exclusion chromatography. Homogeneity of all antibodies was confirmed by SDS-PAGE under non reducing and reducing conditions and analytical size exclusion chromatography. Under reducing conditions (FIG. 1), polypeptide heavy chains of &lt;ANG-2&gt; antibodies showed upon SDS-PAGE apparent molecular sizes of ca. 50 kDa analogous to the calculated molecular weights, polypeptide light chains showed apparent molecular masses of 25 kDa according to their predicted size. Mass spectrometry confirmed the identity of the purified antibodies. Expression levels of all constructs were analyzed by Protein A HPLC.</p>Size exclusion chromatography analysis of the purified.

Briefly, the ELISA-type assay is based on the immobilization of human wild-type Angiopoietin-1 or -2 in a microtiter plate. Binding of an antibody directed against the immobilized ANG-1 or ANG-2 is measured via an &lt;human Fc&gt; (anti-IgG) antibody with a POD conjugate. A dilution series of the &lt;ANG-2&gt;antibody allows determining an EC50 concentration. As a reference the human anti-ANG-2 antibody &lt;ANG-2&gt;antibody Mab536 (Oliner et al., Cancer Cell. Nov. 6 (2004) 507-16, US 2006/0122370) was used.

Briefly, is this assay a capturing antibody (anti-Fc) is immobilized to the surface of the Biacore\u00ae chip, which captures and presents the corresponding antibody (for example Ang2i-LC06). The ligand (here ANGPT2) is captured from solution. The affinity for this interaction is determined with the assumption of a 1:1 interaction.
