    "lae (I), (II), (III), (IV), (VIII) and (IX) such as, without being limited to, the compounds of structural Formulae 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, and of the compound of structural formula 6, in the preparation of medicaments for treatment of diseases as described herein. </p>[0086] The compounds of general Formulae (I), (II), (III), (IV), (VIII) and (IX) especially the specific compounds of Formulae 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, and the compound of structural formula 6 are \n\nmodulators of mitochondrial turnover. The effect of the compounds of the invention and of the specific compounds of Formulae 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 on mitochondrial turnover, i.e. their ability to stimulate mitochondrial clearance, is determined by \"MitoTimer\", a green fluorescent protein targeted to the mitochondrial matrix which emission shifts to red within about 18 hours after its translation. The ratio of the red-to-green fluorescence intensity (FI) was shown to be a reliable parameter of the rate of mitochondrial turnover (Ferree, A.W., et al., MitoTimer probe reveals the impact of autophagy, fusion, and motility on subcellular distribution of young and old mitochondrial protein and on relative mitochondrial protein age. Autophagy, 2013. 9(11): p. 1887-96; Trudeau, K.M., et al., Measurement of mitochondrial turnover and life cycle using MitoTimer. Methods Enzymol, 2014. 547: p. 21-38); and according to other methods as described herein. </p>[0087] The compounds of general Formulae (I), (II), (III), (IV), (VIII) and (IX) have IC50 values for several activities in the range from 1.6 mM to 50 uM. </p>[0088] In view of the ability of the compounds that are described herein to stimulate mitochondrial clearance, the compounds of general Formulae (I), (II), (III), (IV), (VIII) and (IX) especially the specific compounds of Formulae 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, and the compound of structural formula 6, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may be suitable for treating and/or preventing all those conditions or diseases that can be influenced by enhanced mitochondrial turnover. Therefore the compounds according to general Formulae (I), (II), (III), (IV), (VIII) and (IX) especially the each of the specific compounds of Formulae 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, and the compound of structural formula 6, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, are particularly suitable for the prevention or treatment of diseases or conditions associated with impaired mitochondrial turnover, such as, without being limited to, age-related diseases and/or disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases and/or disorders. The compounds of general Formulae (I), (II), (III), (IV), (VIII) and (IX)especially the specific compounds of Formulae 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, and the compound of structural formula 6, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, are also particularly suitable for the prevention or treatment of diseases or conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington\u2019s disease, Diabetes mellitus type 2 and relate"
