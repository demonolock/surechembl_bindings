The inhibitory assay is initiated by the addition of the substituted oxadiazolidinedione (1 - 100 \u03bcM final concentration, maximun DMSO concentration of 0.2%) in a pH 6.6 buffer containing 140 nM recombinant human plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI-1; Molecular Innovations, Royal Oak, MI). Following a 1 hour incubation at room temperature, 70 nM of recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is added, and the combination of the substituted oxadiazolidinedione, PAI-1 and tPA is incubated for an additional 30 minutes. Following the second incubation, Spectrozyme-tPA (American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT), a chromogenic substrate for tPA, is added and absorbance read at 405 nm at 0 and 60 minutes. Relative PAI-1 inhibition is equal to the residual tPA activity in the presence of the test compound and PAI-1. Control treatments include the complete inhibition of tPA by PAI-1 at the molar ratio employed (2:1), and the absence of any effect of the substituted oxadiazolidinedione on tPA alone.</p>\n  [0338] Example 92: Assay for determining IC50 of inhibition of PAI-1.</p>\n  [0339] This assay is based upon the non-SDS dissociable interaction between tPA and active PAI-1. Assay plates are initially coated with human tPA (10 \u03bcg/ml). Substituted oxadiazolidinediones of the present invention are dissolved in DMSO at 10 mM, then diluted \n\nwith physiologic buffer (pH 7.5) to a final concentration of l-50\u03bcM. Test compounds are incubated with human PAI-1 (50 ng/ml) for 15 minutes at room temperature. The tPA-coated plate is washed with a solution of 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.1% BSA, then the plate is blocked with a solution of 3% BSA. An aliquot of the substituted oxadiazolidinedione/PAI-1 solution is then added to the tPA-coated plate, incubated at room temperature for 1 hour, and washed. Active PAI-1 bound to the plate is assessed by adding an aliquot of a 1 : 1000 dilution of the 33B8 monoclonal antibody against human PAI-1, and incubating the plate at room temperature for 1 hour (Molecular Innovations, Royal Oak, MI). The plate is again washed, and a solution of goat anti-mouse IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate is added at a 1:50,000 dilution in goat serum. The plate is incubated 30 minutes at room temperature, washed, and a solution of alkaline phosphatase substrate is added. The plate is incubated 45 minutes at room temperature, and color development is determined at OD o<sub>5nm</sub>- The quantitation of active PAI-1 bound to tPA at varying concentrations of the substituted oxadiazolidinedione is used to determine t"
