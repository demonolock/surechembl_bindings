{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nTest compounds are dissolved in DMSO at a final concentration of lOmM, then diluted 100X in physiologic buffer. \nThe inhibitory assay is initiated by the addition of the substituted oxadiazolidinedione (1 - 100 \u03bcM final concentration, maximun DMSO concentration of 0.2%) in a pH 6.6 buffer containing 140 nM recombinant human plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI-1; Molecular Innovations, Royal Oak, MI). \nSubstituted oxadiazolidinediones of the present invention are dissolved in DMSO at 10 mM, then diluted with physiologic buffer (pH 7.5) to a final concentration of l-50\u03bcM. \nThe tPA-coated plate is washed with a solution of 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.1% BSA, then the plate is blocked with a solution of 3% BSA. \nAn aliquot of the substituted oxadiazolidinedione/PAI-1 solution is then added to the tPA-coated plate, incubated at room temperature for 1 hour, and washed. \nActive PAI-1 bound to the plate is assessed by adding an aliquot of a 1 : 1000 dilution of the 33B8 monoclonal antibody against human PAI-1, and incubating the plate at room temperature for 1 hour (Molecular Innovations, Royal Oak, MI). \nThe plate is again washed, and a solution of goat anti-mouse IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate is added at a 1:50,000 dilution in goat serum."}
