    "lected for linking to the epitopes : TAT : GYGRKKRRQRRR hPERl- 1 : SRRHHCRSKAKRSRHH hPERl - 2 : GRRHHRRSKAKRSR Ant PHD : RQIKI FQNRRMK KK</p>Certain of the epitope peptides were joined to the transcytosis sequence using a linker sequence. The linker was selected from the sequence naturally found directly N-terminal to the epitope sequence, or selected based on known immunological parameters. The selected linker sequences are shown below:</p>OVA: LEQ E (natural )</p>DEVWEL (synthetic) NP 366-374 : RGVQI gplOO (154-162) : FVYVW</p>Several epitopes were selected, as shown below:</p>OVA: SIINFEK NP 366-374: ASNEN ETM</p>(Rotzschke et al . 1990 Nature 348 :252) gplOO (280-288 (9V) ) : YLEPGPVTV</p>(Parkhurst et al . 1996 J.

To determine whether hPERl-CTL conjugates can form CTL target structures,</p><sup>51</sup>Cr-labeled RMA cells were pulsed with 10<sup>\"11</sup> g/ml NP peptide (ASNENMETM) or hPERl-NP peptide (GRRHHRRSKAKRSRASNENMETM), or were left untreated (no peptide) and incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. The cells were then washed and tested for CTL recognition in a standard 4-hour chromium release assay, using T cells obtained from the spleens of C57BL/6 mice immunized with influenza virus. Figure 1A demonstrates that RMA target cells can be sensitized for CTL-mediated lysis when incubated with lO g/ml of hPERl-NP peptide.</p>Further, <sup>51</sup>Cr-labeled P815-A2/K cells were pulsed with 10<sup>\"6</sup> g/ml 280-9V peptide (YLEPGPVTV) or hPERl-280-9V (GRRHHRRSKAKRSRYLEPGPVTV) or were left untreated (no peptide) and incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. The cells were then washed and tested for CTL recognition in a standard 4-hour chromium release assay, using T cells obtained from the spleens of HLA-A2/K<sup>b</sup> transgenic mice immunized with 280-9V peptide in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Where indicated, 5 \u03bcg/ml brefeldin A (BFA) was included in the assay, to block the surface expression of nascent class I MHC molecules. Figure IB demonstrates "
