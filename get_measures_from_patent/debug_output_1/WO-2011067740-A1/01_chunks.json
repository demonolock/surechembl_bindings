    "grown at 37\u00b0C in human A+ RBCs (Red blood cells) at a 2% haematocrit and 2-6% parasitemia, in a 3% C02, 6% 02 and 91% N2 atmosphere. Semi-synchronized cultures were established by Sorbitol (Lambros) treatment. Highly synchronized cultures (4 hour-window synchronization) were obtained by successive Plamion (Pasvol) and Sorbitol treatments. Parasitaemia and stage distribution were determined by optical examination of Diff-Quick stained culture smears. Parasitaemia (expressed in percent) is hundred times the number of parasitized erythrocytes divided by the total number of erythrocytes. \n\n 1.2.2) Enzymatic activity assay on E. coli membranes </p> Recombinant sPLA2S were routinely checked for enzymatic activity through hydrolysis of autoclaved <sup>3</sup>H-oleic acid-labelled E. coli (Franson et al, 1974). </p> 1.2.3) \u0391\u03b7 -Plasmodium activity assay (dose-response assay) </p> Dried preparations of the purified recombinant human sPLA2s were re-suspended at high concentration (usually 50\u03bc\u039c) in RPMI 0.05% BSA, and then tested individually for their capacity to inhibit the in vitro intra-erythrocytic development of P. falciparum. Dose-response assays based on <sup>3</sup>H-hypoxanthine incorporation by growing parasites were performed as in Guillaume et al. (2004). Radioactivity was measured with a 1450 Microbeta counter (Wallac, Perkin Elmer). Percentage of growth inhibition was calculated from the parasite-associated radioactivity compared with control without sPLA2. Values for the IC50 were determined from dose-response curves. </p> 1.2.4) Purification and minimal oxidation of the lipoprotein fractions Purification, oxidation and enzymatic hydrolysis procedures were performed under sterile conditions. Non-fasted human plasma was aliquotted and frozen at -20\u00b0C just after blood drawing. Three weeks before enzymatic hydrolysis experiment, one aliquot of plasma was thawed for purification of CM (chylomicrons)/VLDL (very low-density lipoprotein), LDL (low-density lipoprotein) and HDL (high-density lipoprotein) fractions by differential centrifugation, according to the procedure described in Havel et al. (1955). The lipoprotein fractions were extensively dialyzed at 4\u00b0C against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2). </p> To prepare minimally oxidized lipoproteins, air/light oxidation was induced by storage of the fractions in a transparent flask at ambient temperature and under sterile air exchange for 18-20 days. </p> Native lipoproteins were prepared from another aliquot of the plasma just prior to the hydrolysis assay. When necessary, the lipoprotein fractions were stored at 4\u00b0C under N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere and in the dark after addition of 50 \u03bcg/mL gentamycin. \n\n Phosphatidylcholine (PC) content of each lipoprotein fraction was measured by the use of the Phospholipid B dosage kit (WAKO Chemicals), following manufacturer's instructions. </p> 1.2.5) Evaluation of the oxidized lipoproteins anti-Plasmodium toxi",
    "n to increase in the plasma of malaria patients, was clearly inactive against the parasite. </p> Group-IIF SPLA2 is structurally unique among sPLA2s, in that it has an unusually long, proline-rich C-terminal extension (Valentin et al, 2000b). This extension mediates the GIIF SPLA2 binding to mammalian cells (Wijewickrama et al, 2006). By contrast to the full length form, the C-terminus truncated form of GIIF \n\n IB2010/055580 </p> 23 sPLA2 (GIIFAC), although catalytically active (Singer et ah, 2002), did not inhibit Plasmodium, suggesting that the attachment of truncated GIIF sPLA2 to the erythrocyte membrane and/or lipoprotein surface might be impaired, leading to a drop in toxicity. </p> 2.2) Human sPLA2s* activities on serum components </p> 2.2.1) Anti-Plasmodium activities of human sPLA2s are lowered in the absence of serum </p> The toxicity of venom sPLA2s toward P. falciparum has been attributed mainly to enzymatic hydrolysis of serum phospholipids because those sPLA2s are largely inefficient at killing P. falciparum in the presence of Albumax II\u00ae, a phospholipid-poor serum substitute (Guillaume et ah, 2004). Anti-Plasmodium activities of GX and GIIF sPLA2s were thus assayed in Albumax II\u00ae to assess for their requirement in exogenous PLs. IC<sub>50</sub> values of both enzymes were found to increase in Albumax II\u00ae. Group-X sPLA2 IC<sub>50</sub> value exhibited variable increase according to the experiment, ranging from 25 -fold to 150-fold its value in serum. GIIF sPLA2 IC50 value was increased by approximately 17.5-fold. Therefore, toxicities of both GX and GIIF sPLA2S appeared to be lowered in the presence of Albumax II\u00ae, suggesting that their mechanisms of action rely to some extent on the presence of extra-cellular PLs. </p> 2.2.2) Enzymatic activity on human plasma </p> Hydrolysis of serum by human sPLA2s has been reported for GV and GIIA sPLA2s: the GV sPLA2 was found active, the GIIA SPLA2 was found inactive (Rosengren et ah, 2006). The specific activities of GX, GIIF and GV sPLA2s on whole human plasma was determined by measuring NEFAs released upon incubation with different enzyme concentrations and incubation times. Activities of the bee {Apis melliferd) and Naja mossambica mossambica venom sPLA2s (respectively bvPLA<sub>2</sub> and Naja PLA<sub>2</sub>) were measured for comparison. Results are shown in Table II. </p> Table II: Specific activities of sPLA2s on human plasma. Hydrolysis of plasma phospholipids by human and venom sPLA2s was assayed using different incubation times and enzymes concentrations. Hydrolysis was assessed by measuring \n\n the amount of NEFAs in samples using the colorimetric assay developed by WAKO (NEFA-C kit). Enzymatic production of NEFAs was corrected for endogenous production of NEFAs measured in the absence of sPLA2. Specific activity for each of the sPLA2s was determined from the linear part of the kinetic curve. Values are the mean of three independent experiments. SD: standard deviation. Anti-P. falciparum activities (IC<sub>50</sub>) of the respective sPLA2s are given for comparison. </p><img id=\"imgf000025_0001\" path=\"imgf000025_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/169434726/WO/20110609/A1/002011/06/77/40/imgf000025_0001.tif\"/></p> enzymes. Among the human sPLA2S, GX sPLA2 was 9-times and 30-times more active than GIIF and GV sPLA2S, respectively. In line with what has been reported in serum, high concentration (\u0399 \u03bc\u039c) of Gil A sPLA2 was inefficient at hydrolysing plasma (not shown). Of note, sPLA2s' activities in plasma are in line with their toxic properties against P. falciparum, indicated by their IC50 values. </p> NEFAs released from plasma by IC<sub>50</sub> concentrations of GX, GIIF and bee venom sPLA2s were measured on a time scale relevant to the dose-response assay, i.e. 48h. Three independent experiments with plasmas from different donors were performed that gave similar qualitative results. Results from one experiment are presented in Figure 1. Each SPLA2 at its IC<sub>50</sub> concentration hydrolysed plasma at constant rate for at least 20h, with GX SPLA2 being the most active. This indicated that in the presence of the human sPLA2S, the parasite is potentially submitted to continuous release of NEFAs and lysophospholipids, most probably at the origin of toxicity, as proven in the case of the bee venom enzyme. The non toxic, truncated form of GIIF SPLA2 was largely inefficient at hydrolysing plasma, reinforcing the idea \n\n that hydrolysis of PLs is involved in the anti-Plasmodium activity of native GIIF sPLA2. </p> 2.2.3) Lipoprotein hydrolysis by GX and GIIF sPLA2s </p> GIIA, GIIF, GV and GX sPLA2S are known to readily hydrolyse purified LDL and HDL in their native state (Ishimoto, et al, 2003; Pruzanski et al, 2005, Sato et al, 2008 ), although GIIA sPLA2 was found less efficient than the other sPLA2s (Gesquiere et al, 2002). Malaria patients exhibit elevated oxidation of lipoproteins as compared to normal subjects (Sibmooh et al, 2004), and it is known that such modifications can modulate the susceptibility of lipoproteins to sPLA2s (Eckey et al, 1997; Pruzanski et al, 1998). The ability of recombinant GX and GIIF sPLA2s to hydrolyse oxidized lipoproteins in vitro was then analysed. </p> Prior to the experiment, because it was also previously reported (Guillaume et al, 2006) that CM/VLDL oxidized by prolonged exposure to air and light (minimally oxidized lipoproteins) are inhibitory to the development of P. falciparum in vitro, it was analysed whether similarly oxidized LDL and HDL would be toxic as well. </p> Results are shown in Figure 2. It can be seen that all three classes of lipoproteins are inhibitory when oxidized, with respective IC50 values of 85\u03bcg PL/mL (CM/VLDL), 200\u03bcg PL/mL (LDL), and 300\u03bcg /PL/mL (HDL). Noticeably, parasite growth was enhanced in the presence of native HDL, confirming the nutrient properties of this particular lipoprotein (Grellier et al, 1990). </p> Assuming that PC is the major phospholipid in either class of lipoproteins, enzymatic hydrolysis of lipoproteins was performed at a given enzyme- to-PC ratio after PC measurement in lipoproteins. The bee and Naja venom sPLA2s were assayed in parallel to the human enzymes. Each SPLA2 was used at approximately 10 x IC<sub>50</sub>. Experiment was performed twice with lipoproteins from different donors and gave similar qualitative results. </p> Results from one experiment in triplicate are shown in Figure 3: - the group-X enzyme hydrolysed lipoproteins in the preferential order HDL &gt;LDL &gt; CM/VLDL; \n\n - group-IIF sPLA2 hydrolysed lipoproteins in the same preferential order than GX sPLA2, but, unlike GX SPLA2, it hydrolysed poorly the triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (CM/VLDL); </p> - contrasting with the human sPLA2s, the bee and Naja enzymes hydrolysed lipoproteins in the following preferential order: LDL &gt; HDL &gt; CM/VLDL. </p> - except in the case of the triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins, substantial amount of NEFAs was generated by either enzyme from the oxidized lipoproteins. However, it was noticed that the amount was smaller than that generated from the lipoproteins in their native state.</p><img id=\"imgf000027_0001\" pat"
