Cooper et al., Bone, 2000, 27: 375-381.</p>Other Utilities:</p>The following diseases, disorders and conditions can be treated, controlled, prevented or delayed, by treatment with the compounds of this invention: (1) hyperglycemia, (2) low glucose tolerance, (3) insulin resistance, (4) obesity, (5) lipid disorders, (6) dyslipidemia, (7) hyperlipidemia, (8) hypertriglyceridemia, (9) hypercholesterolemia, (10) low HDL levels, (11) high LDL levels, (12) atherosclerosis and its sequelae, (13) vascular restenosis, (14) pancreatitis, (15) abdominal obesity, (16) neurodegenerative disease, (17) retinopathy, (18) nephropathy, (19) neuropathy, (20) Metabolic Syndrome, (21) hypertension and other disorders where insulin resistance is a component.</p>The above diseases and conditions can be treated using the compounds of structural formula I, or the compound can be administered to prevent or reduce the risk of developing the diseases and conditions described herein. Since concurrent inhibition of 11\u03b2-HSD2 may have deleterious side effects or may actually increase the amount of cortisol in the target tissue where reduction of cortisol is desired, selective inhibitors of 11\u03b2-HSD1 with little or no inhibition of 11\u03b2-HSD2 are desirable.</p>The 11\u03b2-HSD1 inhibitors of structural formula I generally have an inhibition constant IC<sub>50 </sub>of less than about 500 nM, and preferably less than about 100 nM. Generally, the IC<sub>50 </sub>ratio for 11\u03b2-HSD2 to 11\u03b2-HSD1 of a compound is at least about two or more, and preferably about ten or greater. Even more preferred are compounds with an IC<sub>50 </sub>ratio for 11\u03b2-HSD2 to 11\u03b2-HSD1 of about 100 or greater. For example, compounds of the present invention ideally demonstrate an inhibition constant IC<sub>50 </sub>against 11\u03b2-HSD2 greater than about 1000 nM, and preferably greater than 4000 nM.</p>Compounds of structural formula I may be used in combination with one or more other drugs in the treatment, prevention, suppression or amelioration of diseases or conditions for which compounds of structural formula I or the other drugs have utility. Typically the combination of the drugs is safer or more effective than either drug alone, or the combination is safer or more effective than would be expected based on the additive properties of the individual drugs. Such other drug(s) may be administered, by a route and in an amount commonly used contemporaneously or sequentially with a compound of structural formula I. When a compound of structural formula I is used contemporaneously with one or more other drugs, a combination product containing such other drug(s) and the compound of structural formula I is preferred. However, combination therapy also includes therapies in which the compound of structural formula I and one or more other drugs are administered on different overlapping schedules. It is contemplated that when used in combination with other active ingredients, the compound of the present invention or the other active ingredient or both may be used effectively in lower doses than when each is used alone. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include those that contain one or more other active ingredients, in additio"
