For example, delivery to a tumor can be accomplished by intratumoral injections. Other modes of delivery can be used without limitation, including: intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intra-arterial, subcutaneous, and per oral, delivery. Conversely in a mouse model, the antisense or RNA interference can be administered to a tumor cell in vitro, and the tumor cell can be subsequently administered to a mouse. Vectors can be selected for the desirable properties for any particular application. Vectors can be viral or plasmid. Non-viral carriers such as liposomes or nanospheres can also be used.</p>Additional therapeutic agents or candidate therapeutic agents can be identified using a binding assay. The assay can be performed in vitro using purified proteins, or using whole cells. A Reg protein, for example Reg1\u03b1 or Reg3\u03b1, is contacted with Megi in the presence and absence of a test substance. The order of the contacting can be varied. All components can be, but need not be simultaneously contacted. Pairs of reagents can be pre-bound, for example, and displacement by a third reagent can be assessed. The test substances can be natural products or synthetic products; they can be single compounds or combinations of compounds. They can be known or unknown for another use. They can be pre-selected based on structural similarities to other compounds, or they can be screened randomly. Any binding assay known in the art can be used. A two-hybrid type assay can be used in which expression of a reporter gene is dependent on the binding of two binding partner proteins. Alternatively, one of the binding partners may be bound to a solid support. One binding partner can be labeled. Bound or unbound, complexes can be separated from the assay mixture; for example, using immunoprecipitation. Another assay utilizes cells which express one of the binding partners on their cell surface and the other binding partner is added exogenously. Any format for assessing binding between two proteins can be used. Once a binding inhibitor of the Reg protein, for example Reg1\u03b1 or Reg3\u03b1, and the Megi receptor has been identified, it can be used therapeutically to treat tumor cells and tumors. The inhibitor can be administered by any route, particularly intravenous, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, and per mouth.</p>Other embodiments of the present invention provide pharmaceutical formulations and unit dose forms of inhibitors and competitors of Megi and its downstream pathway. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical formulation provided contains the antisense antibody of Megi alone or in combination with one or more other active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).</p>In one embodiment of the present invention, the API is an agent in soluble liposome preparations that allow the optimized delivery to be administered by a variety of routes, including subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intraveno"
