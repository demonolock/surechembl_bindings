    "powder is exposed to sodium hydroxide solution, will range from 1 to 10 minutes and preferably from 2 to 5 minutes. Following granulation, the particles are removed from the granulator and placed in a fluid bed dryer for drying at about 60\u00b0C.</p>\n  EXAMPLE 30 ATR adenosine receptor assays</p>\n  Methods Radioligand binding for A<sub>2</sub>\u00ab adenosine receptor. Human A<sub>2B</sub> adenosine receptor cDNA was stably transfected into HEK-293 cells (referred to as HEK-A2B cells).</p>\n  Monolayer of HEK-A2B cells were washed with PBS once and harvested in a buffer containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mM EDTA and protease inhibitors. These cells were homogenized in polytron for 1 minute at setting 4 and centrifuged at 29000 g for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C. The cell pellets were washed once with a buffer containing 10 mM HEPES (pH7.4), 1 mM EDTA and protease inhibitors, and were resuspended in the same buffer supplemented with 10% sucrose. Frozen aliquots were kept at - 80\u00b0C. Competition assays were started by mixing 10 nM <sup>3</sup>H-ZM241385 (Tocris Cookson) with various concentrations of test compounds and 50 \u03bcg membrane proteins in TE buffer (50 mM Tris and 1 mM EDTA) supplemented with 1 Unit/mL adenosine deaminase. The assays were incubated for 90 minutes, stopped by filtration using Packard Harvester and washed four times with ice-cold TM buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM MgC12, pH 7.4). Non specific binding was determined in the presence of 10 \u03bcM ZM241385. The affinities of compounds (i.e. Ki values) were calculated using GraphPad software.</p>\n  Radioligand binding for other adenosine receptors. Human Ai , A<sub>2A</sub>, A<sub>3</sub> adenosine receptor cDNAs were stably transfected into either CHO or HEK-293 cells (referred to as CHO-Al, HEK-A2A, CHO- A3). Membranes were prepared from these cells using the same protocol as described above. Competition assays were started by mixing 0.5 nM <sup>3</sup>H-CPX (for CHO-Al), 2 nM 1H-ZM241385 (HEK-A2A) or 0.1 nM <sup>125</sup>I-AB-MECA (CHO-A3) with various concentrations of test compounds and the perspective membranes in TE buffer (50 mM Tris and 1 mM EDTA fo CHO-Al and \n\nHEK-A2A) or TEM buffer (50 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA and 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> for CHO- A3) supplemented with 1 Unit/mL adenosine deaminase. The assays were incubated for 90 minutes, stopped by filtration using Packard Harvester and washed four times with ice-cold TM buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM MgC12, pH 7.4). Non specific binding was determined in the presence of 1 \u03bcM CPX (CHO-Al), 1 \u03bcM ZM214385 (HEK- A2A) and 1 \u03bcM IB-MECA (CHO-A3). The affinities of compounds (i.e. Ki values) were calculated using GraphPad software. cAMP measurements. Monolayer of transfected cells were collected in PBS containing 5 mM EDTA. Cells were washed once with DMEM and resuspended in DMEM containing 1 Unit/mL adenosine deaminase at a density of 100,000-500,000 cells/ml. 100 \u03bcl of the cell suspension was mixed with 25 \u03bcl containing various agonists and/or antagonists and the reaction was kept at 37\u00b0C for 15 minutes. At the end of 15 minutes, 125 \u03bcl 0.2N HC1 was added to stop the reaction. Cells were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1000 rpm. 100 \u03bcl of the supernatant was removed and acetylated. The concentrations of cAMP in the supematants were measured using the direct cAMP assay from Assay Design. A and A <sub>B</sub> adenosine receptors are coupled to Gs proteins and thus agonists for A<sub>2A</sub> adenosine receptor (such as CGS21680) or for A <sub>B</sub> adenosine receptor (such as NECA) increase the cAMP accumulations whereas the antagonists to these receptors prevent the increase in cAMP accumulations-induced by the agonists. Ai and A<sub>3</sub> adenosine receptors are coupled to Gi proteins and thus agonists for A<sub>t</sub> adenosine receptor (such as CPA) or for A<sub>3</sub> adenosine receptor (such as IB-MECA) inhibit the increase in cAMP accumulations-induced by forskolin. Antagonists to Ai and A<sub>3</sub> receptors prevent the inhibition in cAMP accumulations. The compounds of the invention were shown to be A<sub>2</sub>\u03b2-antagonists by the abov"
