    "the RSV F1 or F2 domains may have modifications relative to the wild-type strain as shown in SEQ ID NO:2. For example, the F1 domain may have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 alterations, which may be mutations or deletions. Similarly, the F2 domain may have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 alterations, which may be mutations or deletions. The F1 and F2 domains may each independently retain at least 90%, at least 94% at least 95% at least 96% at least 98% at least 99%, or 100% identity to the wild-type sequence.</p>In a particular example, an RSV nanoparticle drug product may contain about 0.025% to about 0.03% PS80 with RSV F at a range of about 270 \u03bcg/mL to about 300 \u03bcg/mL, or about 60 \u03bcg/mL to about 300 \u03bcg/mL. In other aspects, the nanoparticle drug product may contain about 0.035% to about 0.04% PS80 in a composition with RSV F at 300 \u03bcg/mL to about 500 \u03bcg/mL. In yet other aspects, the nanoparticle drug product may contain about 0.035% to about 0.04% PS80 in a composition with RSV F at 350-500 \u03bcg/mL.</p>Because the concentrations of antigen and detergent can vary, the amounts of each may be referred as a molar ratio of non-ionic detergent: protein. For example, the molar ratio of PS80 to protein is calculated by using the PS80 concentration and protein concentration of the antigen measured by ELISA/A280 and their respective molecular weights. The molecular weight of PS80 used for the calculation is 1310 and, using RSV F as an example, the molecular weight for RSV F is 65 kD. Molar ratio is calculated as a follows: (PS80 concentration\u00d710\u00d765000)\u00f7(1310\u00d7RSV F concentration in mg/mL). Thus, for example, the nanoparticle concentration, measured by protein, is 270 \u03bcg/mL and the PS80 concentrations are 0.015% and 0.03%. These have a molar ratio of PS80 to RSV F protein of 27:1 (that is, 0.015\u00d710\u00d765000/(1310\u00d70.27)) and 55:1, respectively.</p>In particular aspects, the molar ratio is in a range of about 30:1 to about 80:1, about 30:1 to about 70:1, about 30:1 to about 60:1, about 40:1 to about 70:1, or about 40:1 to about 50:1. Often, the replacement non-ionic detergent is PS80 and the molar ratio is about 30:1 to about 50:1, PS80: protein. For RSV-F glycoprotein, nanoparticles having a molar ratio in a range of 35:1 to about 65:1, and particularly a ratio of about 45:1, are especially stable.</p>Modified AntigensThe antigens disclosed herein encompass variations and mutants of those antigens. In certain aspects, the antigen may share identity to a disclosed antigen. Generally, and unless specifically defined in context of a specifically identified antigens, the percentage identity may be at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 97%, or at least 98%. Percentage identity can be calculated using the alignment program ClustalW2, available at www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2/. The following default parameters may be used for Pairwise alignment: Protein Weight Matrix=Gonnet; Gap Open=10; Gap Extension=0.1.</p>In particular aspects, the protein co",
    " removed by buffers containing high salt and low molar concentration of methyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside (MMP).</p>In addition, the column washes were also used to detergent exchange the NP-9 detergent with the surfactant polysorbate 80 (PS80). To perform the detergent exchange, the column was incubated with 0.1% PS80 after binding of the RSV F glycoprotein to the lentil lectin column. The RSV F protein was eluted from the lentil lectin column with a high concentration of MMP. After elution, the RSV F protein trimers are assembled into micelle nanoparticles composed of RSV F protein trimers and PS80 contained in a detergent core. After detergent exchange there was a low pH inactivation step followed by incubation on a sulfate column in the presence of buffer with PS80 at 0.1%.</p>The eluted material was diluted in a solution containing PS80 adequate to provide a Drug Substance (DS) for bulk storage with a molar ratio of PS80:RSV F protein of about 50. The adequate composition of the DS was achieved by combining the RSV F nanoparticles in a solution comprising phosphate buffer at 22 mM sodium phosphate, 0.03% PS80, and a pH of 6.2. At each step during and after detergent exchange, the antigen to PS80 ratio in the composition was maintained at a molar ratio between 35 and 60. The molar ratio was calculated using the PS80 concentration and RSV F concentration, as measured by ELISA/A280, and their respective molecular weights. The molecular weight of PS80 is 1310 and for RSV is 65 kD.</p>Example 2Preparation of a Vaccine CompositionTo provide nanoparticles for an administered vaccine product, the Drug Substance was diluted into a Drug Product, with a PS80:RSV protein molar ratio of about 50. Drug Substance was thawed, diluted and filled into glass vials or pre-filled syringes for storage at 2-8\u00b0 C. prior to administration. The nanoparticles bound to alum adjuvant. The alum adjuvant was added and mixed to ensure about 95% of the nanoparticles are bound to the alum is bound, meaning about 0.4 mg per 120 \u03bcg dose of RSV F nanoparticle in a 0.5 mL volume.</p>Example 3RSV F in Nanoparticles Reduce COPD Exacerbation HospitalizationIn a randomized, placebo-controlled study of 11,856 subjects, aged 60 years or older, a vaccine comprising 135 \u03bcg RSV F nanoparticles in the absence of alum reduced all-cause COPD exacerbation hospitalizations (called \u201cE-301\u201d in FIG. 3 and FIG. 4). The subjects were followed for a year to ascertain the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of the vaccine. Surprisingly, administration of the RSV F nanoparticle vaccine reduced hospitalization due to COPD exacerbation in both the general populous of the study (p=0.017) and in a subpopulation of the study of subjects previously identified as having baseline COPD (p=0.14).</p>In a smaller scale, comparable study consisting of 1,600 subjects, aged 60 years or older, the group administered the RSV F nanoparticle vaccine experienced no COPD exacerbation hospitalizations (called \u201cE-201\u201d FIG.
