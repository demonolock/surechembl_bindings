    "Macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) is a member of the family of proteins referred to as colony stimulating factors (CSFs). M-CSF is a secreted or a cell surface glycoprotein comprised of two subunits that are joined by a disulfide bond with a total molecular mass varying from 40 to 90 kD ((Stanley E.R., et al., Mol. Reprod. Dev., 46:4-10 (1997)). Similar to other CSFs, M-CSF is produced by macrophages, monocytes, and human joint tissue cells, such as chondrocytes and synovial fibroblasts, in response to proteins such as interleukin-1 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. M-CSF stimulates the formation of macrophage colonies from pluripotent hematopoietic progenitor stem cells (Stanley E.R., et al., Mol. Reprod. Dev., 46:4-10 (1997)).</p>M-CSF typically bind to its receptor, c-fms, in order to exert a biological effect. c-fms contains five extracellular Ig domains, one transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain with two kinase domains. Upon M-CSF binding to c-fms, the receptor homo-dimerizes and initiates a cascade of signal transduction pathways including the JAK/STAT, PI3K, and ERK pathways.</p>M-CSF is an important regulator of the function, activation, and survival of monocytes/macrophages. A number of animal models have confirmed the role of M-CSF in various diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and cancer. Macrophages comprise key effector cells in RA. The degree of synovial macrophage infiltration in RA has been shown to closely correlate with the extent of underlying joint destruction. M-CSF, endogenously produced in the rheumatoid joint by monocytes/macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, acts on cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage to promote their survival and differentiation into bone destroying osteoclasts, and enhance pro",
    "sent venues for similar intervention.</p>Postmenopausal bone loss results from defective bone remodeling secondary to an uncoupling of bone formation from exuberant osteoclast mediated bone resorption as a consequence of estrogen deficiency. In-vivo neutralization of M-CSF using a blocking antibody has been shown in mice to completely prevent the rise in osteoclast numbers, the increase in bone resorption and the resulting bone loss induced by ovariectomy.</p>Several lines of evidence point to a central role for M-CSF in atherogenesis, and in proliferative intimal hyperplasia after mechanical trauma to the arterial wall. All the major cell types in atherosclerotic lesions have been shown to express M-CSF, and this is further up-regulated by exposure to oxidized lipoprotein. Blockade of M-CSF signaling with a neutralizing c-fms antibody reduces the accumulation of macrophage-derived foam cells in the aortic root of apolipoprotein E deficient mice maintained on a high fat diet.</p>In both experimental and human glomerulonephritis, glomerular M-CSF expression has been found to co-localize with local macrophage accumulation, activation and proliferation and correlate with the extent of glomerular injury and proteinuria. Blockade of M-CSF signaling via an antibody directed against its receptor c-fms significantly down-regulates local macrophage accumulation in mice during the renal inflammatory response induced by experimental unilateral ureteric obstruction.</p>Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute, febrile, pediatric vasculitis of unknown cause. Its most common and serious complications involve the coronary vasculature in the form of aneurismal dilatation. Serum M-CSF levels are significantly elevated in acute phase Kawasaki's disease, and normalize following treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin. Giant cell arthritis (GCA) is an inflammatory vasculopathy mainly occurring in the elderly in which T cells and macrophages infiltrate the walls of medium and large arteries leading to clinical consequences that include blindness and stroke secondary to arterial occlusion. The active involvement of macrophages in GCA is evidenced by the presence of elevated levels of macrophage derived inflammatory mediators within vascular lesions.</p>M-CSF has been reported to render human monocyte derived macrophages more susceptible to HIV-1 infection in vitro. In a recent study, M-CSF increased the frequency with which monocyte-derived macrophages became infected, the amount of HIV mRNA expressed per infected cell, and the level of proviral DNA expressed per infected culture.</p>Given the role of M-CSF in various diseases, a method for inhibiting M-CSF activity is desirable.</p>While anti-M-GSF antibodies have been previously described (see, e.g., WO 90/09400</patcit>), there is a critical need for therapeutic anti-M-CSF antibodies.</p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to the embodiments as defined in the claims. Thus, it relates to the following i",
    "ich one or more of the CDRs are taken or from one or more different human antibodies.</p>Fragments or analogs of antibodies or immunoglobulin molecules can be readily prepared by those of ordinary skill in the art following the teachings of this specification. Preferred amino- and carboxy-termini of fragments or analogs occur near boundaries of functional domains. Structural and functional domains can be identified by comparison of the nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence data to public or proprietary sequence databases. Preferably, computerized comparison methods are used to identify sequence motifs or predicted protein conformation domains that occur in other proteins of known structure and/or function. Methods to identify protein sequences that fold into a known three-dimensional structure are known. See Bowie et al., Science 253:164 (1991).</p>The term \"surface plasmon resonance\", as used herein, refers to an optical phenomenon that allows for the analysis of real-time biospecific interactions by detection of alterations in protein concentrations within a biosensor matrix, for example using the BIACORE\u2122 system (Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden and Piscataway, N.J.). For further descriptions, see Jonsson U. et al., Ann. Biol. Clin. 51:19-26 (1993); Jonsson U. et al., Biotechniques 11:620-627 (1991); Jonsson B. et al., J. Mol. Recognit. 8:125-131 (1995); and Johnsson B. et al., Anal. Biochem. 198:268-277 (1991).</p>The term \"K<sub>D</sub>\" refers to the equilibrium dissociation constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction.</p>The term \"epitope\" includes any protein determinant capable of specific binding to an immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor or otherwise interacting with a molecule. Epitopic determinants generally consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and generally have specific three dimensional structural characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. An epitope may be \"linear\" or \"conformational.\" In a linear epitope, all of the points of interaction between the protein and the interacting molecule (such as an antibody) occur linearally along the primary amino acid sequence of the protein. In a conformational epitope, the points of interaction occur across amino acid residues on the protein that are separated from one another. An antibody is said to specifically bind an antigen when the dissociation constant is \u2264 1 mM, preferably \u2264 100 nM and most preferably \u2264 10 nM. In certain embodiments, the K<sub>D</sub> is 1 pM to 500 pM. In other embodiments, the K<sub>D</sub> is between 500 pM to 1 \u03bcM. In other embodiments, the K<sub>D</sub> is between 1 \u03bcM to 100 nM. In other embodiments, the K<sub>D</sub> is between 100 mM to 10 nM. Once a desired epitope on an antigen is determined, it is possible to generate antibodies to that epitope, e.g., using the techniques described in the present invention. Alternatively, during the discovery process, the generation and characterization of antibodies may elucidate information about desirable epitopes. From this information, it is then possible to competitively screen antibodies for binding to the same epitope. An approach to achieve this is to conduct cross-competition studies to find antibodies that competitively bind with one another, e.g., the antibodies compete for binding to the antigen. A high throughout process for \"binning\" antibodies based upon their cross-competition is described in International Patent Application No. WO 03/48731</patcit>.</p>As used herein, the twenty conventional amino acids and their abbreviations follow conventional usage. See Immunology - A Synthesis (2nd Edition, E.S. Golub and D.R. Gren, Eds., Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, Mass. (1991)), which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>The term \"polynucleotide\" as referred to herein means a polymeric form of nucleotides of at least 10 bases",
    "tibodies that are specific for a particular class and subclass of antibody. Such antibodies are commercially available. The class and subclass can be determined by ELISA, or Western Blot as well as other techniques. Alternatively, the class and subclass may be determined by sequencing all or a portion of the constant domains of the heavy and/or light chains of the antibodies, comparing their amino acid sequences to the known amino acid sequences of various class and subclasses of immunoglobulins, and determining the class and subclass of the antibodies.</p>In some embodiments, the anti-IVI-CSF antibody is a monoclonal antibody. The anti-M-CSF antibody can be an IgG, an IgM, an IgE, an IgA, or an IgD molecule. In preferred embodiments, the anti-M-CSF antibody is an IgG and is an IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4 subclass. In other preferred embodiments, the antibody is subclass IgG2 or IgG4. In another preferred embodiment, the antibody is subclass IgG1.</p>Species and Molecular SelectivityIn another aspect of the invention, the anti-M-CSF antibodies demonstrate both species and molecule selectivity. In some embodiments, the anti-M-CSF antibody binds to human, cynomologus monkey and mouse M-CSF. Following the teachings of the specification, one may determine the species selectivity for the anti-M-CSF antibody using methods well known in the art. For instance, one may determine the species selectivity using Western blot, FACS, ELISA, RIA, a cell proliferation assay, or a M-CSF receptor binding assay. In a preferred embodiment, one may determine the species selectivity using a cell proliferation assay or ELISA.</p>In another embodiment, the anti-M-CSF antibody has a selectivity for M-CSF that is at least 100 times greater than its selectivity for GM-/G-CSF. In some embodiments, the anti-M-CSF antibody does not exhibit any appreciable specific binding to any other protein other than M-CSF. One can determine the selectivity of the anti-M-CSF antibody for M-CSF using methods well known in the art following the teachings of the specification. For instance one can determine the selectivity using Western blot, FACS, ELISA, or RIA.</p>Identification of M-CSF Epitopes Recognized by Anti- M-CSF AntibodiesThe invention provides a human anti-M-CSF monoclonal antibody that binds to M-CSF and competes with, cross-competes with and/or binds the same epitope and/or binds to M-CSF with the same K<sub>D</sub> as (a) an antibody selected from 252, 88, 100, 3.8.3, 2.7.3, 1.120.1, 9.14.4I, 8.10.3F, 9.7.2IF, 9.14.4, 8.10.3, 9.7.2, 9.7.2C-Ser, 9.14.4C-Ser, 8.10.3C-Ser, 8.10.3-CG2, 9.7.2-CG2, 9.7.2-CG4, 9.14.4-CG2, 9.14.4-CG4, 9.14.4-Ser, 9.7.2-Ser, 8.10.3-Ser, 8.10.3-CG4, 8.10.3FG1 or 9.14.4G1; (b) an antibody that comprises a heavy chain variable region having an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34, 38, 46, 50, 54, 58, 62, 66, 70, 74, 78, 82, 86, 90, 94, 98 or 102; (c) an antibody that comprises a light chain variable region having an amino acid se",
