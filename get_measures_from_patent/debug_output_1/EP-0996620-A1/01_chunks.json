    "n with a final concentration of lmM). Human fibrinogen (Sigma, F 4883) and 8-sulphophenyltheophylline (8-SPT which was used to block any Pi-agonist activity of compounds) were added to give final concentrations of 0.2 mg/ml (60 \u03bcl of 10 mg/ml solution of clottable protein in saline) and 300 nM (10 \u03bcl of 15 mM solution in 6% glucose), respectively. Platelets or buffer as appropriate were added in a volume of 150 \u03bcl to the individual wells of a 96 well plate. All measurements were made in triplicate in platelets from each donor.</p>\n  The agonist/antagonist potency was assessed as follows.</p>\n  Aggregation responses in 96 well plates were measured using the change in absorbance given by the plate reader at 660 nm. Either a Bio-Tec Ceres 900C or a Dynatech MRX were used as the plate reader.</p>\n  The absorbance of each well in the plate was read at 660 nm to establish a baseline figure. Saline or the appropriate solution of test compound was added to each well in a volume of 10 \u03bcl to give a final concentration of 0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 or 100 mM. The plate was then shaken for 5 min on an orbital shaker on setting 10 and the absorbance read at 660 nm. Aggregation at this point was indicative of agonist activity of the test compound. Saline or ADP (30 mM; 10 \u03bcl of 450 mM) was then added to each well and the plate shaken for a further 5 min before reading the absorbance again at 660 nm.</p>\n  Antagonist potency was estimated as a % inhibition of the control ADP response to obtain an IC50 Compounds exemplified have PIC50 values of greater than 5.0. \n</p>\n"
