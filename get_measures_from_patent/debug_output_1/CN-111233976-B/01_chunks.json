    "ne, and after the instrument is cleaned, adding ultrapure water for ultrasonic filtration into the reference cell and the sample cell (repeatedly pumping to remove bubbles in the cells);</p>(5) setting experiment parameters, setting the general rotating speed to 750rpm, setting the temperature to 25 \u2103, setting the micro-titration of 19-20 drops per 2 mu l drop, executing sample loading by a titration needle, and performing a water drop experiment;</p>(6) after the water drop experiment proves that the instrument is clean, the titration of the sample can be carried out, the titration of the general sample comprises the sample water drop, the sample buffer and the sample protein drop, and the integrated analysis is carried out on the titration results for 3 times; in this example, only two titrations of sample water and sample protein were required because the sample was dissolved with ultrapure water.</p>(7) After titration is finished, if the exothermic or endothermic value is not changed or the titration saturation value is not reached, the concentration ratio is adjusted according to data analysis to carry out a secondary experiment;</p>(8) and (3) processing data, performing simulation fitting on the heat release curve by using origin analysis software to calculate parameters such as N (stoichiometric ratio of reaction), KA (affinity constant), delta H (enthalpy change caused by reaction), delta S (entropy change caused by reaction) and the like, wherein the KA value is a binding constant, and KD is 1/KA.</p>(9) The results show affinity KD values for LLC2B and FGFR2 and HER2 proteins of 0.96nM and 1.49nM, respectively (fig. 5).</p>Example 3: synthesis of LLC2B-SS-DM1</p>The structure of LLC2B-SS-DM1 is shown in FIG. 1, and the coupling process is shown in FIG. 2:</p>(1) weighing 1.0g of amide resin, then putting the amide resin into a reaction tube, adding 2 times of DMF (N, N-dimethylformamide) by volume, and soaking for 2-3 hours; the solution was removed by aspiration, a DMF solution (8 ml) containing 20% (w/w) 4-methylpiperidine was added thereto and reacted for 5 minutes, and a DMF solution (8 ml) containing 20% (w/w) 4-methylpiperidine was added thereto and reacted for 15 minutes after the solution was removed; and (3) pumping the solvent through a suction filtration device, then washing the solvent by using DMF (dimethyl formamide) for three times, methanol for three times and DMF for three times, and then adding analytical grade DMF to balance for 2-5 minutes.</p>(2) The solvent is dried by a suction filtration device, 2 times volume of Fmoc-Lys (Dde) -OH containing Fmoc (fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl) group protection compound with 5 times molar concentration and NMP (N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidinone) solution with 5 times molar concentration of HCTU are added, then 10 times molar concentration of DIEA is added, and the oscillation and rotation reaction is carried out for at least 2-4 hours.</p>(3) And (3) detection: washing a small amount (about 1 mg) of the resin obtained in the step (2) with DMF (dimethyl f"
