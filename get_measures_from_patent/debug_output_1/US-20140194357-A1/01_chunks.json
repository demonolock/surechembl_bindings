For instance, in some embodiments, the hydrazine- or hydrazide-terminal PEG derivative will have the following structure:</p>[RO\u2014(CH2CH2O)n-O\u2014(CH2)2-NH\u2014C(O)]2CH(CH2)m-X\u2014NH\u2014NH2\n</p>where R is a simple alkyl (methyl, ethyl, propyl, etc.), m is 2-10 and n is 100-1,000, and X is optionally a carbonyl group (C\u2550O) that can be present or absent.</p>In some embodiments, the PEG derivatives containing a semicarbazide group will have the structure:</p>[RO\u2014(CH2CH2O)n-O\u2014(CH2)2-C(O)\u2014NH\u2014CH2-CH2]2CH\u2014X\u2014(CH2)m-NH\u2014C(O)\u2014NH\u2014NH2\n</p>where R is a simple alkyl (methyl, ethyl, propyl, etc.), X is optionally NH, O, S, C(O) or not present, m is 2-10 and n is 100-1,000.</p>In some embodiments, the PEG derivatives containing a hydroxylamine group will have the structure:</p>[RO\u2014(CH2CH2O)n-O\u2014(CH2)2-C(O)\u2014NH\u2014CH2-CH2]2CH\u2014X\u2014(CH2)m-O\u2014NH2\n</p>where R is a simple alkyl (methyl, ethyl, propyl, etc.), X is optionally NH, O, S, C(O) or not present, m is 2-10 and n is 100-1,000,</p>The degree and sites at which the water soluble polymer(s) are linked to the relaxin polypeptide can modulate the binding of the relaxin polypeptide to the relaxin polypeptide receptor. In some embodiments, the linkages are arranged such that the relaxin polypeptide binds the relaxin polypeptide receptor with a Kd of about 400 nM or lower, with a Kd of 150 nM or lower, and in some cases with a Kd of 100 nM or lower, as measured by an equilibrium binding assay, such as that described in Spencer et al., J. Biol. Chem., 263:7862-7867 (1988).</p>Methods and chemistry for activation of polymers as well as for conjugation of peptides are described in the literature and are known in the art. Commonly used methods for activation of polymers include, but are not limited to, activation of functional groups with cyanogen bromide, periodate, glutaraldehyde, biepoxides, epichlorohydrin, divinylsulfone, carbodiimide, sulfonyl halides, trichlorotriazine, etc. (see, R.

Cells are cultured in growth medium (GM) containing 10% iron-enriched fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. For standard adipocyte differentiation, 2 days after cells reached confluency (referred as day 0), cells are exposed to differentiation medium (DM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 \u03bcg/ml of relaxin, 1 \u03bcM dexamethasone, and 0.5 \u03bcM isobutylmethylxanthine, for 48 hours. Cells then are maintained in post differentiation medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and 10 \u03bcg/ml of relaxin. In vitro potency may be measured with the glucose uptake assays which are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In vitro potency can be defined as the measure of glucose uptake of a relaxin compound in a cell-based assay and is a measure of the biological potency of the relaxin compound. It can be expressed as the EC50 which is the effective concentration of compound that results in 50% activity in a single dose-response experiment.</p>Glucose Transport Assay\u2014Relaxin Dependent\u2014Hexose uptake, as assayed by the accumulation of 0.1 mM 2-deoxy-D-[14C]glucose, is measured as follows: 3T3-L1 adipocytes in 12-well plates are washed twice with KRP buffer (136 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 10 mM NaPO4, 0.9 mM CaCl2, 0.9 mM MgSO4, pH 7.4) warmed to 37\u00b0 C. and containing 0.2% BSA, incubated in Leibovitz's L-15 medium containing 0.2% BSA for 2 hours at 37\u00b0 C. in room air, washed twice again with KRP containing, 0.2% BSA buffer, and incubated in KRP, 0.2% BSA buffer in the absence (Me2SO only) or presence of wortmannin for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. in room air. Relaxin is then added to a final concentration of 100 nM for 15 minutes, and the uptake of 2-deoxy-D-[14C]glucose is measured for the last 4 minutes. Nonspecific uptake, measured in the presence of 10 \u03bcM cytochalasin B, is subtracted from all values. Protein concentrations are determined with the Pierce bicinchoninic acid assay. Uptake is measured routinely in triplicate or quadruplicate for each experiment. The effect of acute and chronic pretreatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with FGF-21 in the presence of relaxin may be investigated.</p>Glucose Transport Assay\u2014Relaxin Independent\u20143T3-L1 fibroblast are plated in 96-well plates and differentiated into fat cells (adipocytes) for 2 weeks.
