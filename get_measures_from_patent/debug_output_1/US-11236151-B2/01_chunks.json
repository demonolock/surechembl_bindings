    "om a hypervariable region of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or non-human primate having the desired antibody specificity, affinity, and capability. In some instances, framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details, see Jones et al., Nature 321:522-25 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323-329 (1988); and Presta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2:593-96 (1992).</p>A \u201cspecies-dependent antibody,\u201d e.g., a mammalian anti-human IgE antibody, is an antibody which has a stronger binding affinity for an antigen from a first mammalian species than it has for a homologue of that antigen from a second mammalian species. Normally, the species-dependent antibody \u201cbinds specifically\u201d to a human antigen (i.e., has a binding affinity (Kd) value of no more than about 1\u00d710\u22127 M, preferably no more than about 1\u00d710\u22128 and most preferably no more than about 1\u00d710\u22129 M) but has a binding affinity for a homologue of the antigen from a second non-human mammalian species which is at least about 50-fold, or at least about 500-fold, or at least about 1000-fold, weaker than its binding affinity for the human antigen. The species-dependent antibody can be of any of the various types of antibodies as defined above, but preferably is a humanized or human antibody.</p>The term \u201cvariable domain residue numbering as in Kabat\u201d or \u201camino acid position numbering as in Kabat,\u201d and variations thereof, refers to the numbering system used for heavy chain variable domains or light chain variable domains of the compilation of antibodies in Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991). Using this numbering system, the actual linear amino acid sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of, or insertion into, a FR or CDR of the variable domain. For example, a heavy chain variable domain may include a single amino acid insert (residue 52a according to Kabat) after residue 52 of H2 and inserted residues (e.g. residues 82a, 82b, and 82c, etc. according to Kabat) after heavy chain FR residue 82. The Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given antibody by alignment at regions of homology of the sequence of the antibody with a \u201cstandard\u201d Kabat numbered sequence.</p>The phrase \u201csubstantially similar,\u201d or \u201csubstantially the same,\u201d as used herein, denotes a sufficiently high degree of similarity between two numeric values (generally one associated with an antibody of the disclosure and the other associated with a reference/comparator antibody) such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of little or no biological and/or statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by the values (e.g., Kd values). The difference between the two values is preferably less than about 50%, preferably less than about 40%, preferably less than about 30%, preferably less than about 20%, preferably less than about 10% as a function of the value for the reference/comparator antibody.</p>\u201cBinding affinity\u201d generally refers to the strength of the sum of noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g., an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, \u201cbinding affinity\u201d refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1:1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., antibody and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (Kd). Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art, including those described herein. Low-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to dissociate readily, whereas high-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain bound longer. A variety of methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art, any of which can be used for purposes of this disclosure. Illustrative embodiments are described in the following.</p>The \u201cKd\u201d or \u201cKd value\u201d according to this disclosure is measured by a radiolabeled antigen binding assay (MA) performed with the Fab version of an antibody of interest and its antigen as described by the following assay that measures solution binding affinity of Fabs for antigen by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of (125I)-labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen, then capturing bound antigen with an anti-Fab antibody-coated plate (Chen, et al., (1999) J. Mol Biol 293:865-881). To establish conditions for the assay, microtiter plates (Dynex) are coated overnight with 5 mcg/ml of a capturing anti-Fab antibody (Cappel Labs) in 50 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.6), and subsequently blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature (approximately 23\u00b0 C.). In a non-adsorbant plate, 100 pM or 26 pM [125I]-antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest (e.g., consistent with assessment of an anti-VEGF antibody, Fab-12, in Presta et al., (1997) Cancer Res. 57:4593-4599). The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight; however, the incubation may continue for a longer period (e.g., 65 hours) to ensure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter, the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature (e.g., for one hour). The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS. When the plates have dried, 150 microliter/well of scintillant (MicroScint-20; Packard) is added, and the plates are counted on a Topcount gamma counter (Packard) for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20% of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays. The Kd or Kd value may also be measured by using surface plasmon resonance assays using a BIAcore\u2122-2000 or a BIAcore\u2122-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) at 25\u00b0 C. with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at approx. 10 response units (RU). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIAcore Inc.) are activated with N-ethyl-N\u2032-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NETS) according to the supplier's instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, into 5 mcg/ml (approx. 0.2 uM) before injection at a flow rate of 5 microliter/minute to achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen, 1M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) at 25\u00b0 C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 microliter/min. Association rates (kon) and dissociation rates (koff) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneous fitting the association and dissociation sensorgram. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) is calculated as the ratio koff/kon. See, e.g., Chen, Y., et al., (1999) J. Mol Biol 293:865-881. If the on-rate exceeds 10<sup>6 </sup>M\u22121 S\u22121 by the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation=295 nm; emission=340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25\u00b0 C. of a 20 nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow equipped spectrometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-Aminco spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stir red cuvette.</p>An \u201con-rate\u201d or \u201crate of association\u201d or \u201cassociation rate\u201d or \u201ckon\u201d according to this disclosure can also be determined with the same surface plasmon resonance technique described above using a BIAcore\u2122-2000 or a BIAcore\u2122-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) at 25\u00b0 C. with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at approx.10 response units (RU). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIAcore Inc.) are activated with N-ethyl-N\u2032-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, into 5 mcg/ml (approx.0.2 uM) before injection at a flow rate of 5 microliter/minute to achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of 1M ethanolamine to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) at 25\u00b0 C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 microliter/min. Association rates (kon) and dissociation rates (koff) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneous fitting the association and dissociation sensorgram. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated as the ratio koff/kon. See, e.g., Chen, Y., et al., (1999) J. Mol Biol 293:865-81. However, if the on-rate exceeds 10<sup>6 </sup>M\u22121 S\u22121 by the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate is preferably determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation=295 nm; emission=340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25\u00b0 C. of a 20 nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow equipped spectrophometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-Aminco spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stirred cuvette.</p>The phrase \u201csubstantially reduced,\u201d or \u201csubstantially different\u201d, as used herein, denotes a sufficiently high degree of difference between two numeric values (generally one associated with an antibody of the disclosure and the other associated with a reference/comparator antibody) such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by the values (e.g., Kd values, HAMA response). The difference between the two values is preferably greater than about 10%, preferably greater than about 20%, preferably greater than about 30%, preferably greater than about 40%, preferably greater than about 50% as a function of the value for the reference/comparator antibody.</p>An \u201cantigen\u201d is a predetermined antigen to which an antibody can selectively bind. The target antigen may be polypeptide, carbohydrate, nucleic acid, lipid, hapten or other naturally occurring or synthetic compound. Preferably, the target antigen is an EBV gp350 polypeptide. An \u201cacceptor human framework\u201d for the purposes herein is a framework comprising the amino acid sequence of a VL or VH framework derived from a human immunoglobulin framework, or from a human consensus framework. An acceptor human framework \u201cderived from\u201d a human immunoglobulin framework or human consensus framework may comprise the same amino acid sequence thereof, or may contain pre-existing amino acid sequence changes. Where pre-existing amino acid changes are present, preferably no more than 5 and preferably 4 or less, or 3 or less, pre-existing amino acid changes are present. Where pre-existing amino acid changes are present in a VH, preferably those changes are only at three, two, or one of positions 71H, 73H and 78H; for instance, the amino acid residues at those positions may be 71A, 73T and/or 78A. The VL acceptor human framework may be identical in sequence to the VL human immunoglobulin fra",
    "ting a viral particle, or a cell or a tissue expressing the antigen, and does not significantly cross-react with other proteins, such as other herpes virus proteins. The extent of binding of the antibody or oligopeptide to a \u201cnon-target\u201d protein will often be less than about 10% of the binding of the antibody or oligopeptide to its target protein as determined by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis or radioimmunoprecipitation (RIA). Regarding the binding of an antibody or oligopeptide to a target molecule, the terms \u201cspecific binding\u201d or \u201cspecifically binds to\u201d or \u201cis specific for\u201d a particular polypeptide or an epitope on a particular polypeptide target means binding that is measurably different from a non-specific interaction. Specific binding can be measured, for example, by determining binding of a molecule compared to binding of a control molecule, which generally is a molecule of similar structure that does not have binding activity. For example, specific binding can be determined by competition with a control molecule that is similar to the target, for example, an excess of non-labeled target. In this case, specific binding is indicated if the binding of the labeled target to a probe is competitively inhibited by excess unlabeled target. The term \u201cspecific binding\u201d or \u201cspecifically binds to\u201d or \u201cis specific for\u201d a particular polypeptide or an epitope on a particular polypeptide target as used herein can be exhibited, for example, by a molecule having a Kd for the target of at least about 10<sup>\u22124 </sup>M, alternatively at least about 10<sup>\u22125</sup>M, alternatively at least about 10<sup>\u22126 </sup>M, alternatively at least about 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, alternatively at least about 10<sup>\u22128</sup>M, alternatively at least about 10<sup>\u22129</sup>M, alternatively at least about 10<sup>\u221210 </sup>M, alternatively at least about 10<sup>\u221211</sup>M, alternatively at least about 10<sup>\u221212</sup>M, or greater. The term \u201cspecific binding\u201d may refer to binding where a molecule binds to a particular polypeptide or epitope on a particular polypeptide without substantially binding to any other polypeptide or polypeptide epitope.</p>An antibody or oligopeptide that \u201cinhibits the growth of infected cells expressing an EBV gp350 protein\u201d or a \u201cgrowth inhibitory\u201d antibody or oligopeptide is one which results in measurable growth inhibition of infected cells expressing or overexpressing the appropriate EBV gp350 protein. The EBV gp350 protein may be a transmembrane polypeptide expressed on the surface of an infected cell or may be a polypeptide that is produced and secreted by an infected cell. Preferred growth inhibitory anti-gp350 antibodies or oligopeptides inhibit growth of gp350-expressing cells by greater than 20%, preferably from about 20% to about 50%, and even more preferably, by greater than 50% (e.g., from about 50% to about 100%) as compared to the appropriate control, the control typically being cells not treated with the antibody or olig",
    "ells (also referred to as fusion partner). For example, if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the selective culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT medium), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.</p>Preferred fusion partner myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level production of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a selective medium that selects against the unfused parental cells. Preferred myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines, such as those derived from MOPC-21 and MPC-11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif. USA, and SP-2 and derivatives e.g., X63-Ag8-653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va., USA. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for producing human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor, J. Immunol., 133:3001 (1984); and Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987)).</p>Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (MA) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis described in Munson et al., Anal. Biochem., 107:220 (1980).</p>Once hybridoma cells that produce antibodies of the desired specificity, affinity, and/or activity are identified, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, pp. 59-103 (Academic Press, 1986)). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, D-MEM or RPMI-1640 medium. In addition, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal e.g., by i.p. injection of the cells into mice.</p>The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium, ascites fluid, or serum by conventional antibody purification procedures such as, for example, affinity chromatography (e.g., using protein A or protein G-Sepharose) or ion-exchange chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, etc.</p>DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be placed"
