    "sing the HBV core gene.</p>Example 3: Creation of a String of Immunodominant EpitopesBased on the knowledge of HBV molecular biology, the space to accommodate a foreign sequence in HBV genome is limited to more or less 195 nucleotides. Due to this space limitation, a short sequence encoding foreign immuno-dominant epitopes (polyepitope) is introduced into the recombinant HBV genome in order to induce a robust immune response. Regarding the polyepitope, it is arranged with 3 CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell epitopes combined with a promiscuous CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell epitope (PADRE), which could universally accommodate several prevalent MHC class II molecules. For the CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell response, considering the clinical relevance, three well known HLA-A2-restricted epitopes derived from common human viruses (HIV gag, Influenza matrix, EBV BML-F1) are chosen. Additionally, a short B-cell epitope (FLAG) is introduced into the foreign sequence as a convenient detection marker for molecular biology assays (see Figures 2 and 6A-6D). A HLA-A2-restricted capsid-derived epitope (core 18-27) is present in the N-terminal part of the capsid protein.</p>Example 4: Assessing Polyepitope ExpressionIn vitroThe precore-core region of HBV encodes the hepatitis core antigen (HBcAg) that self assembles to form viral capsids, and a secreted polypeptide, the hepatitis e antigen (HBeAg). These two proteins are derived by alternative initiation of translation at two in frame codons (see Figure 2). The 16 Kd HBe protein is derived by proteolytic cleavage from a precursor protein initiated at the first initiation codon. To assess expression of the polyepitope by the recombinant HBV, the hepatoma cell line HepG2 was transfected with prHBV1.3-IV and three days later cell lysate was collected for immunoblot analysis. Detection of recombinant rHBe protein using anti-Flag monoclonal antibody is shown in Figure 4.</p>Expression of the polyepitope carried by the recombinant virus was also detected after transfection of Huh7 cells with prHBV1.3 in immunofluorescence assays using anti-FLAG MoAb (see Figure 5, panel B). Expression of HBsAg was also detected on the Huh7 cells using anti-HBs MoAb (Figure 5, panel A). Localization of intracellular HBsAg was homogeneously dispersed in the cytoplasm, whereas the tagged recombinant HBc antigen localized in the perinuclear area with some polarization.</p>Example 5: Assessing Polyepitope Expression In vivoExpression of the polyepitope carried by the recombinant virus was also assessed after hydrodynamic injection of mice with prHBV1.3-III DNA (Yang P.L., et al., 2002, Hydrodynamic injection of viral DNA: a mouse model of acute hepatitis B virus infection, Proc Natl Acad Sci, U.S.A, 99:13825-30; Pajot A., et al., 2004, A mouse model of human adaptive immune functions: HLA-A2.1/HLA-DR1-transgenic H-2 class I/class II-knockout mice, Eur J Immunol, 34(11):3060-9).</p>Three days after injection of prHBV1.3-III DNA, the liver was collected and histoch",
    "Polyethylenimine (PEI) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), and used for transient transfection assays. Cell culture supernatant was harvested at day four post PEI transfection and used to prepare rHBV viral DNA.</p>The immunofluorescence experiments were performed on HepG2 cells three days after DNA transfection, using published methods. Briefly, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Cells or tissue sections were incubated with anti-Flag mAb (1084; 1:100; Sigma-Aldrich) or anti-HBs mAb (3E7; 1:100; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) at 4\u00b0C overnight. After extensive washing, the bound primary antibody was detected by Alexa 488-labeled rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA).</p>Histological staining was performed on freshly prepared mouse liver, frozen in isopentane pre-cooled in liquid nitrogen, and embedded in OCT compound in cryomolds. Five micron thick cryostat sections were mounted on superfrost plus slides and stored at -80\u00b0C. Before staining, slides were fixed in ice-cold acetone for 5-10 minutes. Liver sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, or immunostained with FITC labeled anti-HBs antibody (1:50; ab32914, Abcam, Cambridge, MA). After extensive washing with PBST and PBS, the liver sections were mounted with an anti-fade reagent containing DAPI.</p>After transient transfection of prHBV1.3 plasmid into hepatocyte-derived HepG2 cell line, a recombinant protein with the expected size (15 kD) was detected by Western blot in cell lysates using anti-FLAG antibody (Figure 12A). The rHBc protein was also detected by antibody staining and immunoflorescence in the cytoplasm of HepG2 transfected cells, using anti-Flag antibody (Figure 12B, lower panel). Expression of HBV envelope proteins in cells transfected with the rHBV was detected using an antibody against HBsAg, which is the major antigenic determinant of the envelope (Figure 12B, upper panel). Interestingly, labeling of intracellular HBsAg was homogeneously dispersed in the cytoplasm, whereas the rHBe localized in the perinuclear area, with polarization. In addition, HBsAg particles carrying the HBV large envelope protein (L) were also detected by ELISA in cell culture supernatant after prHBV1.3 transfection (see below and Figure 12D).</p>Example 10: Rescue of rHBV Particles and Replication by In Trans EncapsidationrHBV is a defective HBV virus owing to the disrupted core gene. However, it replicates and maintains in hepatocytes with the help of a wild type HBV capsid produced in trans in infected hepatocytes. The invention provides replicative forms of rHBV viral DNA in cell culture supernatant, e.g., from the Huh-7 hepatic cell line, after transfection of prHBV1.3/HBc plasmid encoding both rHBV genome and capsid protein but not after transfection of prHBV1.3.</p>Viral DNA associated with rHBV virions was extracted from the cell culture supernatants of HepG2- or Huh 7-transfected cells. Briefly, the virus par"
