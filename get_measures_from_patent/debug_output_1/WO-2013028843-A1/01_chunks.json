    "rom the group consisting of small organic or inorganic molecules, monosaccharides, disaccharides, trisaccharides, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, biological macromolecules, e.g., peptides, proteins, peptide analogs and derivatives thereof, peptidomimetics, nucleic acids, nucleic acid analogs and derivatives, polynucleotides, oligonucleotides, enzymes, an extract made from biological materials such as bacteria, plants, fungi, or animal cells or tissues, naturally occurring or synthetic compositions, particulates, or any combinations thereof. An active agent can be charge neutral or comprise a net charge, e.g., active agent is anionic or cationic. Furthermore, an active agent can be hydrophobic, hydrophilic, or amphiphilic. In some embodiments, the active agent comprises at least one aryl or heteroaryl group. </p> [00161] As used herein, the term \"particulate\" refers to a particle, powder, flake, etc., that inherently exists in a relatively small form and may be formed by, for example, grinding, shredding, fragmenting, pulverizing, atomizing, or otherwise subdividing a larger form of the material into a relatively small form. </p> [00162] As used herein, the term \"small molecule\" can refer to compounds that are \"natural product-like,\" however, the term \"small molecule\" is not limited to \"natural productlike\" compounds. Rather, a small molecule is typically characterized in that it contains several carbon\u2014 carbon bonds, and has a molecular weight of less than 5000 Daltons (5 kD), preferably less than 3 kD, still more preferably less than 2 kD, and most preferably less than \n\n 1 kD. In some cases it is highly preferred that a small molecule have a molecular mass equal to or less than 700 Daltons. </p> [00163] In some embodiments, the active agent can be a peptide or a protein. As used herein, the term \"peptide\" is used in its broadest sense to refer to compounds containing two or more amino acids, amino acid equivalents or other non-amino groups joined to each other by peptide bonds or modified peptide bonds. Peptide equivalents can differ from </p>conventional peptides by the replacement of one or more amino acids with related organic acids (such as PABA), amino acids or the like or the substitution or modification of side chains or functional groups. A peptide can be of any size so long; however, in some embodiments, peptides having twenty or fewer total amino acids are preferred. Additionally, the peptide can be linear or cyclic. Peptide sequences specifically recited herein are written with the amino terminus on the left and the carboxy terminus on the right. In addition, the term \"peptide\" broadly includes proteins, which generally are polypeptides. As used herein, the term \"protein\" is used to describe proteins as well as fragments thereof. Thus, any chain of amino acids that exhibits a three dimensional structure is included in the term \"protein\", and protein fragments are accordingly embraced. </p> [00164] A peptidomimetic is a molecule capable of folding into a defined three- dimensional structure similar to a natural peptide </p> [00165] As"
