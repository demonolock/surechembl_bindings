    "o a specific arrangement of amino acids located on a peptide or protein to which an antibody or antibody fragment binds. Epitopes often consist of a chemically active surface grouping of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains, and have specific three dimensional structural characteristics as well as specific charge characteristics. Epitopes can be linear, i.e., involving binding to a single sequence of amino acids, or conformational, i.e., involving binding to two or more sequences of amino acids in various regions of the antigen that may not necessarily be contiguous in the linear sequence.</p>As used herein, the terms \u201cspecifically binds\u201d, \u201cbind specifically\u201d, \u201cspecific binding\u201d, and the like as applied to the present antibody compounds refer to the ability of a specific binding agent (such as an antibody) to bind to a target molecular species in preference to binding to other molecular species with which the specific binding agent and target molecular species are admixed. A specific binding agent is said specifically to recognize a target molecular species when it can bind specifically to that target.</p>As used herein, the term \u201cbinding affinity\u201d refers to the strength of binding of one molecule to another at a site on the molecule. If a particular molecule will bind to or specifically associate with another particular molecule, these two molecules are said to exhibit binding affinity for each other. Binding affinity is related to the association constant and dissociation constant for a pair of molecules, but it is not critical to the methods herein that these constants be measured or determined. Rather, affinities as used herein to describe interactions between molecules of the described methods are generally apparent affinities (unless otherwise specified) observed in empirical studies, which can be used to compare the relative strength with which one molecule (e.g., an antibody or other specific binding partner) will bind two other molecules (e.g., two versions or variants of a peptide). The concepts of binding affinity, association constant, and dissociation constant are well known.</p>As used herein, the term \u201csequence identity\u201d means the percentage of identical nucleotide or amino acid residues at corresponding positions in two or more sequences when the sequences are aligned to maximize sequence matching, i.e., taking into account gaps and insertions. Identity can be readily calculated by known methods, including but not limited to those described in: Computational Molecular Biology, Lesk, A.

W., ed., Academic Press, New York, 1993; Computer Analysis of Sequence Data, Part I, Griffin, A. M., and Griffin, H.

Applied Math., 48: 1073 (1988). Methods to determine identity are designed to give the largest match between the sequences tested. Moreover, methods to determine identity are codified in publicly available computer programs</p>Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted, for example, by the local homology algorithm of Smith &amp; Waterman, by the homology alignment algorithms, by the search for similarity method or, by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, PASTA, and TFASTA in the GCG Wisconsin Package, a",

Cells were then washed with media and incubated for an additional hour at 37\u00b0 C. with HRP labeled secondary anti-human antibody (Promega) diluted 1/2500 in media. Cells were washed three times with PBS, and the peroxidase substrate 3,3\u2032, 5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine is added (Sigma; Catalog #T4444). Reactions were terminated by the addition of HCl to 0.7N, and absorbance at 450 nM is determined using a Tecan model Infinite M200 plate reader. The apparent binding affinities of these clones to human OVIO-hCD47 cells was determined by non-linear fit (Prism GraphPad software).</p>All of the murine mAbs bound to human hCD47 on hRBCs with apparent affinities in the picomolar (pM) range (FIG. 1B and Table 1). All of the murine mAbs showed cross-species binding with varying affinities observed for RBCs obtained from other species (FIG. 1A and Table 1).</p>TABLE 1Anti-CD47 Mouse mAbs Bind to CD47 from Multiple Species.mAbHumanPigDogRatMouseVx1045912371417931Vx1191&gt;10,000&lt;13231246Vx1238460101&gt;10,000&lt;13Vx138741021620&gt;10,000&gt;10,000</p>Similarly, the chimeric and humanized mAbs bound to hRBCs and to human OVI0 hCD47 tumor cells in a concentration-dependent manner (Table 2, FIG. 2A and FIG. 2B) with apparent affinities in the picomolar nanomolar range.</p>TABLE 2CD47 Apparent Binding Affinity for Human-Mouse Dual-Function Chimeric mAbs.Kd (pM)Human TumorKd (pM)Cell-basedHumanELISARBCVx10_mh_IgG1N297Q8740Vx10_mh_IgG4PE9148Vx12_mh_IgG1N297Q6990Vx12_mh_IgG4PE70120</p>Example 4CD47 mAbs Reverse TSP-1 Inhibition of NO-Stimulated cGMP Production in Jurkat CellsTSP1 is a potent inhibitor of NO-stimulated cGMP production (Isenberg, PNAS Sep. 13, 2005. 102 (37) 13141-13146) and may inhibit angiogenic responses at the level of this second messenger. DEA/NO transiently induces cGMP levels in Jurkat cells however, addition of 100 pM TSP1 inhibits the NO-stimulated increase in cGMP. Jurkat JE6.1 cells were incubated overnight in serum-free medium followed by incubation with 10 ug/ml Vx10, Vx11, Vx12, Vx13, or no antibody with or without TSP1. DEA/NO was subsequently added and cGMP levels were detected by ELISA (Cayman Chemical). Vx13 potently reversed TSP inhibition of cGMP production, whereas Vx10, Vx11, Vx12 and no antibody treatment did not (FIG. 3).</p>Example 5CD47 Antibodies Block CD47/SIRP\u03b1 BindingTo assess the effect of mouse CD47 mAbs on binding of CD47 to SIRP\u03b1 in vitro the following method is employed using the binding of fluorescently-labelled SIRP\u03b1-Fc fusion protein to CD47 expressing Jurkat T cells. SIRP\u03b1-Fc fusion protein (R&amp;D Systems, cat #4546-SA) was labelled using an Alexa Fluor\u00ae antibody labelling kit (Invitrogen Cat No. A20186) according to the manufacturers specifications. 1.5\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>Jurkat T cells were incubated with CD47 mAbs (5 \u03bcg/ml) or a control antibody in RPMI containing 10% medi"
