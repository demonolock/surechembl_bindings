    "e in water and 2% (v/v) of Poloxamer 188 (Lutrol F68), the compound was suspended by vortexing for 10 minutes. The pH was adjusted to 7 with a few drops of aqueous NaOH (0.1 N). Remaining particles in the suspension were further suspended by using an ultrasonic bath.</p>For intraperitoneal (Lp.) administration: to the desired quantity (0.5-15 mg) of the solid compound 1 in a glass tube, some glass beads were added and the solid was milled by vortexing for 2 minutes. After addition of 1 ml of a solution of 1 % methylcellulose and 5% mannitol in water, the compound was suspended by vortexing for 10 minutes. Finally the pH was adjusted to 7.</p>EXAMPLE 6: PHARMACOLOGICAL METHODS</p>In vitro affinity for human cannabinoid-CE\u00f7<sub>H</sub> receptors</p>The affinity of the compounds of the invention for cannabinoid CB<sub>1</sub> receptors can be determined using membrane preparations of CHO cells in which the human cannabinoid CB<sub>1</sub> receptor is stably transfected in conjunction with [<sup>3</sup>H]CP-55,940 as radioligand. After incubation of a freshly prepared cell membrane preparation with the [<sup>3</sup>H]-ligand, with or without addition of compounds of the invention, separation of bound and free ligand is performed by filtration over glassfiber filters. Radioactivity on the filter is measured by liquid scintillation counting.</p>In vitro affinity for serotonin reuptake sites</p>Affinity of the compounds for serotonin reuptake sites was determined using the receptor binding assay described (Habert, 1985).</p>EXAMPLE 7: PHARMACOLOGICAL TESTRESULTS</p>Cannabinoid-CB-i receptor affinity data and serotonin reuptake inhibition data obtained according to the protocols given above are shown in the table below. \n\n\n<img id=\"imgf000037_0003\" path=\"imgf000037_0003.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/85881036/WO/20080717/A1/002008/08/40/57/imgf000037_0003.tif\"/>\n</p><img id=\"imgf000037_0001\" path=\"imgf000037_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/85881031/WO/20080717/A1/002008/08/40/57/imgf000037_0001.tif\"/><img id=\"imgf000037_0002\" path=\"imgf000037_0002.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/85881046/WO/20080717/A1/002008/08/40/57/imgf000037_0002.tif\"/>\n compound A</p>The data given above indicate that the compounds of the invention have a high affinity for both CB<sub>1</sub> receptors and 5-HT reuptake sites. Their affinity for CB<sub>1</sub> receptors is as high as that of rimonabant, whilst e.g. compound 1 simultaneously is as potent a serotonin reuptake inhibitor as fluoxetine. This in sharp contrast with for instance a structurally closely related potent CB<sub>1</sub> antagonist disclosed in WO 03/027076 (see structure above) which is completely inactive as serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Other CB<sub>1</sub> antagonists tested are devoid of affinity for 5-HT reuptake sites, and the 5-HT reuptake inhibitors tested do not have affinity for CB<sub>1</sub> receptors. \n\n EXAMPLE 8: PHARMAC"
