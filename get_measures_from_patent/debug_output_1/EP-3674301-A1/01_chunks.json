    " 3 min treatment with Accutase (Life Technologies). After washing, the cells in suspension in RPMI-1640 (Life Technologies) were loaded with calcein-AM (5 \u00b5M) (Life Technologies) for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C and re-suspended into RPMI w/o phenol red medium containing 10 % FBS.</p>Adhesion assay. The cell suspension was aliquoted into the wells at a density of 1.0x10<sup>5</sup> cells/well (RLMVEC) and 5.0x10<sup>4</sup> (HMVEC, and RAEC). The test compounds are added at the same time with the cells. The plates are incubated for 1.5 h at 37 \u00b0C. The cells that did not adhere during this incubation were removed by gentle washing. The wash was performed by 2 cycles of aspiration of the supernatant and addition of 100 \u00b5L of the prewarmed fresh DPBS (Life Technologies). A fluorescence of the remaining cells is measured using multimode plate reader (Victor 2V, PerkinElmer) at an excitation/emission wavelengths of 485/535 nm. The compounds were tested starting with maximal concentration of 1 \u00b5M with half-log dilution schedule. IC<sub>50</sub> values were calculated with Prism 5 (GraphPad, CA) by fixing the bottom of the curves to a value of blank for empty wells fluorescence.</p>As shown in Table 2, all the fluorinated \u03b1v antagonists are active in inhibiting cellular adhesion to vitronectin through the \u03b1v integrin. Non-fluorinated reference antagonist, L-845704, is shown for comparison.\nTable 2.

Anti-angiogenic activity using chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assayCAM surfaces were grafted with gelatin sponges impregnated with the concentrations of test compounds and 50 ng VEGF dissolved in PBS. Untreated CAM received only VEGF and PBS. Error bars represent SEM, N = 5, P values for the treated groups were calculated by comparing with the untreated group (*p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001).</p>Test Substance Preparation: Test samples and standards were dissolved in PBS and sterilized by passing through a syringe filter(0.22 \u00b5m). hVEGF(SIGMA) 50 ng/\u00b5l was prepared in sterile PBS.</p>Grafting: Gelatin sponge (Abogel) was cut in approximately 2 mm<sup>3</sup> pieces and loaded with required test substance or PBS and VEGF. The graft was placed on the CAM.</p>Eggs: Fertile hen eggs were procured from a hatchery and were cleaned and decontaminated using alcohol. 1 ml of albumin was removed using a syringe and incubated for 8 days. Grafts were placed on developing CAMs and further incubated to day12. On day12, CAMs were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS, dissected and imaged.</p>Imaging: Fixed CAMs were imaged under constant illumination and magnification under a stereomicroscope fitted with a digital camera (CANON).</p>Image analysis: Images"
