    "units/ml each) and fetal bovine serum (FBS, 3%) (GIBCO, all conc. final). Assay was performed under sterile conditions; only test compound preparation was nonsterile. Initial stock solutions were made in DMSO followed by dilution into RPMI 1640 2-fold higher than the desired final assay concentration. Confluent THP.1 cells (2\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml, final conc.; American Type Culture Company, Rockville, Md.) were added to 96 well polypropylene round bottomed culture plates (Costar 3790; sterile) containing 125 \u03bcl test compound (2 fold concentrated) or DMSO vehicle (controls, blanks). DMSO concentration did not exceed 0.2% final. Cell mixture was allowed to preincubate for 30 min, 37\u00b0 C., 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>prior to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1 \u03bcg/ml final; Siga L-2630, from E.coli serotype 0111.B4; stored as 1 mg/ml stock in endotoxin screened distilled H<sub>2</sub>O at \u221280\u00b0 C.). Blanks (unstimulated) received H<sub>2</sub>O vehicle; final incubation volume was 250 \u03bcl. Overnight incubation (18-24 hr) proceeded as described above. Assay was terminated by centrifuging plates 5 min, room temperature, 1600 rpm (400\u00d7g); supernatants were transferred to clean 96 well plates and stored \u221280\u00b0 C. until analyzed for human TNF\u03b1 by a commercially available ELISA kit (Biosource #KHC3015, Camarillo, Calif.). Data was analyzed by non-linear regression (Hill equation) to generate a dose response curve using SAS Software System (SAS institute, Inc., Cary, N.C.). The calculated IC50 value is the concentration of the test compound that caused a 50% decrease in the maximal TNF\u03b1 production. </p>[1322] Preferred compounds including those from the synthetic examples above were evaluated and had IC<sub>50</sub>&lt;10 uM in this assay. </p>[1323] Inhibition of Other Cytokines </p>[1324] By similar methods using peripheral blood monocytic cells, appropriate stimuli, and commercially available ELISA kits (or other method of detection such as radioimmunoassay), for a particular cytokine, inhibition of IL-1beta, GM-CSF, IL-6 and IL-8 can be demonstrated for preferred compounds (for example, see J. C. Lee et al., 1988, Int. J. Immunopharmacol., 10, 835). </p>"
