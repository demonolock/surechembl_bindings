{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n* Treatment with simvastatin (1 mM) not only completely reversed the downregulation of ecNOS by hypoxia, but resulted in a 3-fold increase in ecNOS activity over basal activity (18 \u00b1 5.0 nmol/500,000 cells/24 h, p &lt; 0.05).\n* This upregulation of ecNOS activity was attenuated by the addition of L-mevalonate (400 mM) (9.6 \u00b1 1.3 nmol/500,000 cells/24 h, p &lt; 0.05).\n* Interestingly, simvastatin (1 mM) alone upregulated nitrite production 5-fold (30 \u00b1 6.5 nmol/500,000 cells/24 h, p &lt; 0.01), which was completely blocked by L-mevalonate (400 mM) (8.6 \u00b1 2.9 nmol/500,000 cells/24 h, p &lt; 0.05).\n* At higher concentrations of simvastatin (1 and 10 mM), ecNOS protein levels were upregulated to 159 \u00b1 13 % and 223 \u00b1 21 % of basal levels (p&lt; 0.05, n=3).\n* Co-treatment with L-mevalonic acid (400 mM) completely blocked simvastatin-induced increase in ecNOS protein levels after 48 h (35 \u00b1 2.4 %).\n* Because lovastatin has a higher IC50 value for HMG-CoA reductase compared to that of simvastatin, it was 10-fold less potent in upregulating ecNOS protein levels than simvastatin at equimolar concentrations."}
