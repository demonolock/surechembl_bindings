    "aracterize the effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on the upregulation ecNOS expression, we treated endothelial cells with simvastatin (0.1 mmol/L) for various durations (0-84 h). Treatment with simvastatin (0.1 mmol/L) increased ecNOS protein levels by</p>\n  4 ( 6%, 21 ( 9%, 80 ( 8%, 90 ( 12%, and 95 ( 16% after 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 84 h, \n\nrespectively (p &lt; 0.05 for all time points after 12 h, n=4). Higher concentrations of simvastatin similarly increased ecNOS protein levels, but in significantly less time compared to lower concentrations of simvastatin. (Western blots, 40 mg protein/lane).</p>\n  In a concentration-dependent manner, treatment with simvastatin (0.01 to 10 mmol/L, 48 h) increased ecNOS expression by 1 ( 6%, 80 ( 8%, 190 ( 10% and 310 ( 20%, respectively (p &lt; 0.05 for concentrations ( 0.1 mmol/L, n=4) (Figure 3 A). The upregulation of ecNOS expression by simvastatin, therefore, is dependent upon both the concentration and duration of simvastatin treatment. For comparison, treatment with lovastatin (0.1 to 10 mmol/L, 48 h) also increased ecNOS expression in a concentration-dependant manner (10 ( 6%&gt;, 105 ( 8%&gt; and 180 ( 11%, respectively, p &lt; 0.05 for concentrations &gt; 0.1 mmol/L, n=3) (Figure 3B) but significantly less effectively than simvastatin at comparable concentrations. Therefore, at the same concentration, simvastatin had greater effects on ecNOS expression compared to lovastatin. These results are consistent with reported IC50 values for simvastatin and lovastatin (4 nmol/L and 19 nmol/L, respectively) (Van Vliet, AK et al., Biochem Pharmacol, 1996, 52:1387-1392).</p>\n  Example 9: Effect of L-Mevalonate on ecNOS Expression</p>\n  To confirm that the effects of simvastatin on ecNOS expression were due to the inhibition of endothelial HMG Co A reductase, endothelial cells were treated with ox-LDL (50 mg/ml, TBARS 15.1 nmol/mg), simvastatin (1 mmol/L), alone or in combination, in the presence of L-mevalonate (100 mmol/L). Treatment with ox-LDL decreased ecNOS expression by 55% ( 6%&gt; after 48 h which was completely reversed and slightly upregulated in the presence of simvastatin (1 mmol/L) (150% ( 8% above basal expression) (p &lt; 0.05 for both, n=3).</p>\n  Compared to endothelial cells treated with ox-LDL and simvastatin, addition of L-mevalonate reduced ecNOS protein by 50% \u00b1 5% (p &lt; 0.05, n=3). Furthermore, the upregulation of ecNOS expression by simvastatin alone (2.9-fold increase, p &lt; 0.05, n=3) was completely reversed by co-treatment with L-mevalonate. Treatment with L-mevalonate alone did not have any appreciable effects on basal ecNOS expression (p &gt; 0.05, n=3). Similar findings were also observed with L-mevalonate and lovastatin.</p>\n  \"HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors Reduce Cerebral Infarct Size by Upregulating endothelial cell Nitric Oxide Synthase \" \n\nExperimental Procedures Cell Culture:</p>\n  Human endothelial cells were harvested from saphenous veins using Type II collagen",
    " 14% (1.5 \u00b1 0.9 nmol/500,000 cells/24 h, p &lt; 0.01). Treatment with simvastatin (1 mM) not only completely reversed the downregulation of ecNOS by hypoxia, but resulted in a 3-fold increase in ecNOS activity over basal activity (18 \u00b1 5.0 nmol/500,000 cells/24 h, p &lt; 0.05). This upregulation of ecNOS activity was attenuated by the addition of L-mevalonate (400 mM) (9.6 \u00b1 1.3 nmol/500,000 cells/24 h, p &lt; 0.05). Interestingly, simvastatin (1 mM) alone upregulated nitrite production 5-fold (30 \u00b1 6.5 nmol/500,000 cells/24 h, p &lt; 0.01), which was completely blocked by L-mevalonate (400 mM) (8.6 \u00b1 2.9 nmol/500,000 cells/24 h, p &lt; 0.05). Similar findings were observed with lovastatin, but at 10-fold higher concentration compared to that of simvastatin.</p>\n  Example 12: Effects of HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors on ecNOS Protein and mRNA Levels</p>\n  In a concentration-dependent manner, treatment with simvastatin (0.01 to 10 mM, 48 h) increased ecNOS expression by 1 ( 6%, 80 ( 8%, 190 ( 10% and 310 ( 20%, respectively (p &lt; 0.05 for concentrations ( 0.1 mM, n=4). Treatment with simvastatin (0.1 mM) increased ecNOS protein levels in a time-dependent manner by 4 ( 6%, 21 ( 9%, 80 ( 8%, 90 ( 12%, and 95 ( 16% after 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 84 h, respectively (p &lt; 0.05 for all time points after 12 h, n=4). Another HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, lovastatin, also increased ecNOS protein levels in a time-, and concentration-dependent manner. Because lovastatin has a higher IC50 value for HMG-CoA reductase compared to that of simvastatin, it was 10-fold less potent in upregulating ecNOS protein levels than simvastatin at equimolar concentrations.</p>\n  We have previously shown that hypoxia downregulates ecNOS protein expression (Liao, JK et al., J Clin Invest, 1995, 96:2661-2666). Compared to normoxia (20% O<sub>2</sub>), exposure to hypoxia (3% 0<sub>2</sub>) resulted in a 46 \u00b1 4 % and 75 \u00b1 3 % reduction in ecNOS protein levels after 24 h and 48 h, respectively (p&lt;0.01 , n=3). In a concentration-dependent manner, treatment with simvastatin produced a progressive reversal of hypoxia-mediated downregulation of ecNOS protein levels after 48 h. At higher concentrations of simvastatin (1 and 10 mM), ecNOS protein levels were upregulated to 159 \u00b1 13 % and 223 \u00b1 21 % of basal levels (p&lt; 0.05, n=3). \n\nCo-treatment with L-mevalonic acid (400 mM) completely blocked simvastatin-induced increase in ecNOS protein levels after 48 h (35 \u00b1 2.4 %). Treatment with L-mevalonic acid alone, however, did not produce any significant effects on basal ecNOS protein levels in untreated cells exposed to hypoxia (25 \u00b1 3.9 %, p&gt;0.05, n=3). In addition, simvastatin which was not chemically-activated had no effect on ecNOS expression. These results indicate that simvastatin-and lovastatin-mediated increases in ecNOS protein expression are mediated by inhibition of endothelial HMG-CoA reductase.</p>\n  To determine whether changes in ecNOS protein levels are due to ch"
