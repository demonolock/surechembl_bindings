    "n of collagen gels and matrices from such modified procollagens has been found to assist in wound healing by attracting growth factors to the wound site. Furthermore, the procollagen matrices have been found to have increased resistance to cell shrinkage.</p>Despite these advances there remains a need to develop further medicaments for assisting in wound healing whilst avoiding or reducing the drawbacks experienced with the prior art applications.</p>Laminins are a large family of multifunctional glycoproteins which are distributed ubiquitously within basement membranes. The laminins have key roles in development, differentiation and migration due to their ability to interact with cells by means of their high affinity binding sites via cell-surface reactors including integrins and type IV collagen. They are composed of three genetically distinct chains, being \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 heterotrimeric proteins that assemble into a cruciform molecule with one long arm and three short arms. There are 18 different laminin isoforms, including Laminin-1, Laminin-2, Laminin-5 and Laminin-10.</p>The laminins are known to bind keratinocytes and provide survival and differentiation signals to epithelial cells and keratinocytes which are critical cells needed for re-epithelialization of dermal wounds.</p>A further molecule that is secreted into the extracellular matrix and is involved in wound healing is secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI). This molecule, also known as antileukoprotease, is an 11.7 kD cationic inhibitor of neutrophil elastase. In addition to protecting against injury, it has also been shown that it functions as an antimicrobial and anti inflammatory. SLPI is produced naturally by the blood and modifies levels of elastase, a substance which breaks down the skin.</p>It is an object of the present invention to address problems associated with prior art medicaments and delivery systems. A further object of the present invention is to address problems associated with collagen matrices and gels known in the art.</p>The present invention is based upon the realization by the inventors that desirable functional characteristics may be introduced into a composition such as a medicament or collagen matrix by designing modified pro-\u03b1 chains according to a first aspect of the present invention which may be trimerized to form procollagen derivatives. These in turn may be converted to collagen monomers (with retained propeptides) and subsequently polymerized. This allows the synthesis and assembly of novel collagen polymers having new biological properties.</p>To this end, a first aspect of the present invention provides a modified pro-\u03b1 chain comprising a triple helical forming domain linked to at least an N-terminal domain characterised in that the N-terminal domain contains a polypeptide sequence from at least part of a laminin glycoprotein or at least part of a secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor or functional derivatives thereof.</p>The inventors have found tha"
