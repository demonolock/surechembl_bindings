    "an: A hyaluronan analogue that is a natural biosynthetic precursor of heparin and heparin sulfate. As a natural product, heparosan is non-antigenic. Heparosan is a member of the glycosaminoglycan polysaccharide family. The heparosan molecular structure (\u03b24GlcUA- \u03b13GlcNAc)<sub>n</sub> is very similar to hyaluronan (\u03b24GlcUA-\u03b23GlcNAc)<sub>n</sub> (GlcUA=glucuronic acid, GlcNAc=N-acetyl-galactosamine) and therefore may act as a mimetic without intrinsic activity (i.e. an antagonist). In the context of the present disclosure, the heparosan can range in size from a short fragment form (12-mer to 16-mer) to a long fragment form (up to 200,000 kDa). All sizes of heparosan are contemplated for use in the methods disclosed herein. In some embodiments, the heparosan is a 12-mer (approximately 4-5 kDa). In other embodiments, the heparosan is approximately 40 kDa.Hyaluronan antagonist: Any compound that acts against and/or blocks the action of hyaluronan. In the context of the present disclosure, hyaluronan antagonists include heparosan and hyaluronan oligosaccharides.Hyaluronan oligosaccharide (oHA): Compounds having the same basic disaccharide structure (N-acetyl glucosamine and glucuronic acid) as native hyaluronan, but distinguishable from both high molecular weight hyaluronan (HMW-HA) and low molecular weight (LMW)-HA (also shown as short fragment HA or sHA) by their small size. The molecular weight of native hyaluronan (including both HMW-HA and LMW-HA) ranges from approximately 50 kD to 10,000 kD, and is composed of hundreds to thousands (up to 25,000) of disaccharide units. In contrast, oHAs are defined as having 2-12 disaccharide units, with a molecular weight of &lt;5 kD.Inhaler: An apparatus for administering vapor or volatilized medications by inhalation. Inhalers are often used to administer medication locally to the airway, for example to treat asthma. In some examples, the inhaler is a dry powder inhaler. In other examples, the inhaler is a metered-dose inhaler.Exertion: Expenditure of energy by skeletal muscles, such as during exercise.Nebulizer: A device that turns liquid forms of medicine into a fine spray (aerosol) that can be inhaled, especially for delivering medication to the deep part of the respiratory tract.Particulate matter: Material suspended in the air in the form of minute solid particles or liquid droplets.Pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles: The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers (vehicles) useful in this disclosure are conventional. Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, by E. W. Martin, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, 15th Edition (1975), describes compositions and formulations suitable for pharmaceutical delivery of one or more therapeutic compounds, molecules or agents.\n\nIn general, the nature of the carrier will depend on the particular mode of administration being employed. For instance, parenteral formulations usually comprise injectable fluids that include pharmaceutically and physiologically acceptable fluids such as water, physiological saline, balanced salt solutions, aqueous dextrose, glycerol or the like as a vehicle. For solid compositions (for example, powder, pill, tablet, or capsule forms), conventi"
