    "). Low pH conditions are also required in order to deactivate potential contaminants such as bacteria, fungi and viruses. Effective removal of potential contaminants is an important step in ensuring drug safety during the manufacture of biological products using mammalian cell lines. However, for many recombinant proteins, incubation at low pH induces aggregation and reduces the yield of recovered protein. Thus, the stability of proteins at low pH is an important factor in successful and efficient manufacture of therapeutic proteins.</p>To test the stability of bispecific CDH3/TRAILR2 binding molecules at low pH, the pH was adjusted to pH 3.5 with 1M acetic acid followed by incubation at room temperature for 90 minutes, followed by neutralization to pH 5.0 with 1M Tris buffer (pH 9.0). Sample concentrations were measured and potential formation of aggregates (high molecular weight species, HMWS) or fragments (low molecular weight species, LMWS) was determined by analytical size exclusion chromatography (aSEC).</p>The results are summarized in table 19 below, which demonstrates that none of the binding molecules CDH3/TRAILR2v1, CDH3/TRAILR2v2, CDH3/TRAILR v3, CDH3/TRAILR2v4, CDH3/TRAILR2v5, CDH3/TRAILR2v6, or CDH3/TRAILR2v7 show any significant increase in HMWS (&lt; 1.06%) or LMWS (0%) or any significant decrease in the main peak (&lt; 1.06%) compared to the starting material (which demonstrated good stability after incubation at pH 3.5 for 90 minutes).</p>TABLE 19 affinity (KD) of CDH3/TRAILR2 binding proteins for human CDH3, as determined by SPR analysis</p></p>"
