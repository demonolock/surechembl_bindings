LBS Binding Assay.[LBS stands for Levetiracetam Binding Site cf. M. Noyer et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. (1995), 286,137-146.]</p>The inhibition constant (K<sub>i</sub>) of a compound is determined in competitive binding experiments by measuring the binding of a single concentration of a radioactive ligand at equilibrium with various concentrations of the unlabeled test substance. The concentration of the test substance inhibiting 50 % of the specific binding of the radioligand is called the IC<sub>50</sub>. The equilibrium dissociation constant K<sub>i</sub> is proportional to the IC<sub>50</sub> and is calculated using the equation of Cheng and Prusoff (Cheng Y. et al., Biochem. Pharmacol. (1972), 22, 3099-3108).</p>The concentration range usually encompasses 6 log units with variable steps (0.3 to 0.5 log). Assays are performed in mono- or duplicate, each K<sub>i</sub> determination is performed on two different samples of test substance.</p>Cerebral cortex from 200-250g male Sprague-Dawley rats are homogenised using a Potter S homogeniser (10 strokes at 1,000 rpm; Braun, Germany) in 20 mmol/l Tris-HCI (pH 7.4), 250 mmol/l sucrose (buffer A); all operations are performed at 4 \u00b0C. The homogenate is centrifuged at 30,000 g for 15 min. The crude membrane pellet obtained is resuspended in 50 mmol/l Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), (buffer B) and incubated 15 min at 37 \u00b0C, centrifuged at 30,000 g for 15 min and washed twice with the same buffer. The final pellet is resuspen-ded in buffer A at a protein concentration ranging from 15 to 25 mg/ml and stored in liquid nitrogen.</p>Membranes (150-200 \u00b5g of protein / assay) are incubated at 4 \u00b0C for 120 min in 0.5 ml of a 50 mmol/l Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2 mmol/l MgCl<sub>2.</sub> 1 to 2 10<sup>-9</sup> mol/l of [<sup>3</sup>H]-2-[4-(3-azidophenyl)-2-oxo-1-pyrrolidinyl]butanamide and increasing concentrations of the test compound of formula (I). The non specific binding (NSB) is defined as the residual binding observed in the presence of a concentration ",
    "rimental design consisted of several groups, one group receiving the vehicle control and the other groups different doses of the test-compound. The compounds are administered intraperitoneally 60 minutes before the induction of audiogenic seizures. The range of the doses administered had a logarithmic progression, generally between 1.0 x 10<sup>-5</sup> mol/kg and 1.0 x 10<sup>-3</sup> mol/kg, but lower or higher doses are tested if necessary.</p>For testing, the animals are placed in small cages, one mouse per cage, in a sound-attenuated chamber. After a period of orientation of 30 seconds, the acoustic stimulus (90 dB, 10-20 kHz) is delivered for 30 seconds via loudspeakers positioned above each cage. During this interval, the mice are observed and the presence of the 3 phases of the seizure activity namely wild running, clonic and tonic convulsions, is recorded. The proportion of mice protected against wild running, clonic and tonic convulsions, respectively, is calculated.</p>For active compounds, an ED<sub>50</sub> value, i.e. the dose producing 50 % protection relative to the control group, together with 95 % confidence limits, is calculated using a Probit Analysis (SAS/STAT\u00ae Software, version 6.09, PROBIT procedure) of the proportions of protected mice for each of the 3 phases of the seizure activity.</p>Compounds synthesized according to the procedure described in examples 1 to 94 and described in table 1 (except compounds 106, 180, 222 and 225) are tested in the SV2 binding assay and/or audiogenic seizure in mice, according to the procedure described above, and are found active.</p>"
