    "are blocked for 3 hours at 37\u00b0 C. with PBS containing 2% BSA (Sigma) and 0.02% NaN<sub>3 </sub>(Sigma). After blocking, plates are incubated overnight at room temperature with serum in different dilutions of PBS. The presence of polyclonal antibodies is checked with both biotin labelled IgG-antibodies to rabbit (Goat anti-rabbit IgG antiserum, 1:25000 dilution), with an incubation time of 40 min. Alkaline phosphatase conjugated streptavidin (Immununo Research, Dianova, CH) is then added at a dilution of 1:10000. Development of the reaction is carried out by adding an alkaline phosphatase substrate (Sigma, f.c. 1 mg/ml) dissolved in diethanolamine. After 45 min. absorbance is read at 405 nm with a reference of 490 nm with an ELISA plate reader (Bio-rad laboratories Ltd., Hemel Hempstead, UK). </p>[0124] Purification: </p>[0125] 5 ml protein A-agarose is poured into a chromatography column and washed with 6 column volumes of 0.1 M tris (hydroxymethyl) methylamine (Tris) buffer pH 7.5. The rabbit serum containing anti-AAGA antibodies is diluted (1/2) with Tris buffer and added to the protein A-agarose. Unbound proteins are removed by washing the column with 6 volumes of Tris buffer. The IgG is eluted off the column with three column volumes of 0.1 M glycine buffer pH 3.0 and collected as 1 ml fractions into tubes containing 28 \u03bcl of 1 M Tris. The fractions which are positive for protein content are checked for purity by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Two bands at 50 and 25 Kd are visualised corresponding to the heavy and light chains of an immunoglobulin molecule. Fractions containing only immunoglobulin are pooled, re-checked for protein concentration and stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. </p>EXAMPLE 6 [0126] This example describes the preparation of monoclonal antibodies against AAGA protein purified as described in Example 4. </p>[0127] Immunisation of Mice: </p>[0128] Female Balb/c mice are immunised intraperitoneally with 100 \u03bcg of AAGA protein in PBS according to the schedule given below:  \nDAYSIMMUNISATIONS\u200211<sup>st </sup>immunisation 1:1 with completeFreund's adjuvant141<sup>st </sup>boost 1:1 with incomplete Freund'sadjuvant212<sup>nd </sup>boost 1:1 with incomplete Freund'sadjuvant28-30Three final boosts in PBS31Fusion with mouse myeloma cells\n</p>[0129] Serum is assessed for anitbody titre by ELISA (Example 5) after the animal is sacrificed for the preparation of spleen cells for fusion. If antibody titre is sufficient, (1/1000 to 1/100,000), the hybridomas are screened otherwise discarded. </p>[0130] Preparation of Myeloma Cells </p>[0131] Sp2/0 murine cells (ATCC #CRL 1581; maintained in culture medium containing 20 \u03bcg/ml 8-azaguanine) are cultivated for one week before fusion in RPMI 1640 (8-azaguanine is not included), 10% (v/v) FCS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (50IU/ml and 50 \u03bcg/ml, respectively). The cells are harvested by centrifugation (200\u00d7g for 5 min) and washed three times in cold RPMI 1640. Approximately 2.5\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>cells are u"
