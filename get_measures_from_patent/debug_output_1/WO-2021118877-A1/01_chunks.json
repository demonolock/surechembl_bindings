    "y) and fluorescent Tracer 647 (Alexa Fluor\u2122) bound to KRas G12C through streptavidin and a biotinylated inhibitor (the \u201cKRas Probe\u201d, see Preparation 223). </p>Inhibitors are tested in dose response format from 10 mM stocks in 100% DMSO. The Labycyte Echo\u00ae 555 is used to dilute and transfer 100 nL per well containing a 10 point, 2.8-fold serial dilution to an assay plate. Two copies of the assay plate are prepared to measure the potency after 5 and 60 minutes incubation of the inhibitor with KRas G12C. His-tagged KRas G12C (20 nM) is added to the plates in assay buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.01% TX-100, and 1 mM DTT). After 5 or 60 minutes incubation, 1 mM KRas Probe is added and allowed to covalently modify free KRas G12C for 1 hour. This is diluted 4-fold in buffer containing Eu Anti-His antibody and Streptavidin-Coated Tracer 647 (both from Life Technologies) to achieve KRas G12C (5 nM), Anti-His Antibody (2 nM), KRas Probe (300 nM), and Streptavidin Coated Tracer 647 (500 nM). After 30 minutes, the fluorescent signal is read on an Envision\u2122 Plate Reader (excitation at 340 nM, tracer emission (em) at 665 nM, and antibody emission at 615 nM). Maximum control wells lack inhibitor and minimum control wells lack both inhibitor and KRas G12C. The signal ratio (em at 665 / em at 615) is converted to percent inhibition using the following equation: % Inhibition = 100 - [(Test Compound Signal - Median Minimum Signal) / (Median Maximum Signal - Median Minimum Signal) x 100] The IC50 is determined by fitting the percent inhibition at each inhibitor concentration to the four parameter nonlinear logistic equation using Genedata Screener\u00ae:\n<img id=\"imgf000152_0001\" path=\"imgf000152_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/841772047/WO/20210617/A1/002021/11/88/77/imgf000152_0001.tif\"/>\n where, y = % inhibition, A = minimum asymptote, B = maximum asymptote, C=relative IC50 or the inhibitor concentration producing 50% inhibition within the fitted range of both asymptotes, and D = Hill Slope. Compounds within the scope of this invention are evaluated in this assay substantially as described above. Exemplified compounds of the invention evaluated in this assay exhibit KRas G12C inhibitor activity by competing with a probe for binding to and covalently modifying KRas G12C at codon 12. The compound of Example 1, for example, evaluated in this assay exhibits an IC50 of less than 0.015 \u03bcM, at 5 and 60 minutes, n = 4. \n\n H358 Cellular Phospho-ERK AlphaLISA\u00ae </p>The purpose of this assay is to measure the ability of test compounds to inhibit the phosphorylation of p-ERKl/2, a downstream effector of KRas in human lung cancer cells H358 (ATCC CRL-5807). Briefly, the AlphaLISA\u00ae SureFire\u00ae Ultra\u2122 p-ERK 1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) assay is a sandwich immunoassay for quantitative detection of phospho- ERK 1/2 (phosphorylated on Thr202/Tyr204 in ERK1, or Thrl85/Tyrl87 in ERK2) in cellular lysates using Alpha Technology (Perkin Elmer Cat# ALSU-PERK-A50K). </p>H358 cells are plated at 40K cells per well in 100 \u03bcL media (RPMI 1640, GIBCO Cat# 22400-071) containing 10% FBS (GIBCO Cat#: 10082-147) in a 96 well plate (Costar #3596) and are incubated overnight in humid trays at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The next morning, 10 \u03bcL of serially-diluted (3-fold) test compounds (50 pM top concentration) and 10 \u03bcL of controls (Maximum signal wells: 5% DMSO and Minimum signal wells: 2 pM of N-(3-{3-cyclopropyl-5-[(2-fluoro-4-iodophenyl)amino]-6,8-dimethyl-2,4,7-trioxo- 3,4,6,7-tetrahydropyrido[4,3-D]pyrimidin-l(2H)-yl}phenyl)acetamide (trametinib, as a positive control) are added to the cell plate and incubated for 2 hours in humid trays at 37 \u00b0C/5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Lysis Buffer is prepared at ambient temperature containing a protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail. Culture medium is removed by inverting and shaking the cell plate in the sink and then blotting onto a paper towel. Lysis buffer is added to the cell plate (50 \u03bcL per well) and the plate is incubated at ambient temperature for 10 minutes on a shaker. For p-ERK detection, acceptor beads are diluted into a suspension mixture with buffer. Using a STARlet liquid handler, 5 \u03bcL of acceptor beads and 2 \u03bcL of cell lysate are transferred as a single-step in-tip dilution to a 384 well assay plate. The assay plate is sealed with foil and is incubated at ambient temperature for 2 hours. Donor beads are diluted into a suspension mixture with buffer. Using the STARlet, 5 \u03bcL of donor beads are added to the assay plate that is then sealed, wrapped with foil. The plate is incubated at ambient temperature for 2 hours in the dark. The assay plate is then read on an EnVision\u2122 Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer) using a luminescence program. </p>The signal is converted to percent inhibition using the following equation: </p>% Inhibition = 100 - [(Test Compound Signal - Median Minimum Signal) / (Median Maximum Signal - Median Min Signal) x 100] The Maximum signal is a control well without inhibitor. The Minimum signal is a control well containing a reference inhibitor \n\nsufficient to fully inhibit activity.

The compounds of the Examples exhibite an ability to inhibit the phosphorylation of p-ERKl/2. The compound of Example 1, for example, exhibite a relative IC50 in this assay of 0.00178 mM n =3. This data show that the compounds of the Examples exhibit KRas G12C inhibition activity in this cellular assay. </p>H358 Cellular Active RAS GTPase ELISA </p>The purpose of this assay is to measure the ability of test compounds to inhibit constitutive RAS GTPase activity in human lung cancer cells H358 (ATCC CRL-5807). The RAS GTPase ELISA kit (Active Motif Cat# 52097) contains a 96-well plate pre coated with glutathione in order to capture a kit-supplied GST-Raf-RBD protein. Activated RAS (GTP -bound) in cell extracts specifically bind to the Raf-RBD. Bound RAS is detected with a primary antibody that recognizes human KRas. A secondary antibody conjugated with HRP recognizes the primary antibody and a development solution provides a chemiluminescent readout. </p>H358 cells are plated at 80,000 cells/well in 90 \u03bcL serum free media (RPMI 1640, GIBCO) and incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C/5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

    "tif\"/>\n \n\n In Vitro Combination Efficacy of the Compound of Example 35 with Other</p>Targeted Therapies </p>In addition to monotherapy, the compound of Example 35 is assessed for its combination efficacy with other targeted therapies, such as CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitor abemaciclib, EGFR small molecule inhibitors erlotinib or afatinib, EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab, and the ERK inhibitor LY3214996. Eleven cell lines for this study are obtained from ATCC and grown under ATCC recommended conditions. All cell lines have a KRAS G12C mutation, and they are six lung cancer cell lines (H358, H1373, H1792, H2030, H2122, SW1573 and HCC44), two colorectal cancer cell lines (SW837 and SW1463), one pancreatic cancer cell line (MiaPaca-2), and one esophageal cancer cell line (KYSE410). The proliferation assay is performed as a 4 day growth assay using Cell TiterGlo\u00ae as the readout. Briefly, cells are plated in 96-well cell culture plates and allowed to adhere overnight at 37\u00b0C. The following day, cells are treated with compounds, either single treatments or combination treatments. First, the testing compounds are serially diluted in DMSO, followed by dilution into media as a 5X concentration with 1% DMSO, and finally added to cells in media to dilute to IX. The cells are incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 4 more days. At the end of the incubation period, Cell TiterGlo\u00ae reagent is mixed and added to the wells. After 10 minutes, the luminescence is read by a Perkin Elmer Envision instrument. Absolute IC50 values generated by a 4- parameter logistics model for the single and combination treatments are generated, followed by combination indexes for each combination treatment and cell line. The combination IC50 values are adjusted based on the total concentration of each compound when added together. (Example: for a 1:1 concentration ratio of compound 1 and compound 2, the combination IC50 is increased by a factor of 2). The combination index (Cl) measures the degree to which the potency of a combination therapy differs from the expected-if-additive potency and is based on the Loewe definition of additivity. \n<img id=\"imgf000166_0001\" path=\"imgf000166_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/841772068/WO/20210617/A1/002021/11/88/77/imgf000166_0001.tif\"/>\n </p>Where </p>\u2022 \n<img id=\"imgf000166_0002\" path=\"imgf000166_0002.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/841772070/WO/20210617/A1/002021/11/88/77/imgf000166_0002.tif\"/>\n are the concentrations of therapies A and B that produce an effect, \n\n y, when given in combination </p>\u2022 are the concentrations of A and B that produce an effect, y, \n<img id=\"imgf000167_0001\" path=\"imgf000167_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/841772073/WO/20210617/A1/002021/11/88/77/imgf000167_0001.tif\"/>\n when given individually </p>In some cases, if an estimated IC50 value is used for Cl calculation, the calculated Cl is called Potentiation Index. The biological interpretation of the combination or potentiation index is as follows: synergistic if the combination or potentiation index &lt; 0.5, additive if the combination or potentiation index is between 0.5 and 2, and antagonistic if the combination index or potentiation is &gt; 2. </p>As shown in Table 31, combination of the compound of Example 35 and abemaciclib has additive or synergistic efficacy in inhibiting tumor cells with KRasG12C mutation.
