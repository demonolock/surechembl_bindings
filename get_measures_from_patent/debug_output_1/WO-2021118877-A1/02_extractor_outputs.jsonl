(Example: for a 1:1 concentration ratio of compound 1 and compound 2, the combination IC50 is increased by a factor of 2). \nAs shown in Table 31, combination of the compound of Example 35 and abemaciclib has additive or synergistic efficacy in inhibiting tumor cells with KRasG12C mutation. \nAmong eleven cell lines tested, additive effects are observed in five cell lines, with a Combination Index (Cl) between 0.5 and 1.2, and a synergistic effect is observed in six cell lines, with Cl < 0.5, suggesting that combination of the compound of Example 35 and abemaciclib may provide benefit to cancer patients with a KRas G12C mutation. \nAs shown in Table 32, the combination of the compound of Example 35 and the EGFR small molecule inhibitor erlotinib or afatinib has an additive or a synergistic effect in inhibiting tumor cells harboring a KRasG12C mutation."}
