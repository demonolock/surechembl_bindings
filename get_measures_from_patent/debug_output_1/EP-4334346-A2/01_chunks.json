An ABD (or antibody, antigen-binding fragment, and/or the chimeric protein including the same) is said to \u201crecognize\u201d the epitope (or more generally, the antigen) to \n<!-- EPO <DP n=\"19\"/>-->\nwhich the ABD specifically binds, and the epitope is said to be the \u201crecognition specificity\u201d or \u201cbinding specificity\u201d of the ABD. The ABD is said to bind to its specific antigen or epitope with a particular affinity. As described herein, \u201caffinity\u201d refers to the strength of interaction of non- covalent intermolecular forces between one molecule and another. The affinity, /. e. , the strength of the interaction, can be expressed as a dissociation equilibrium constant (KD), wherein a lower KD value refers to a stronger interaction between molecules. KD values of antibody constructs are measured by methods well known in the art including, but not limited to, bio-layer interferometry (e.g. Octet/FORTEBIO\u00ae), surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology (e.g. Biacore\u00ae), and cell binding assays (e.g., Flow-cytometry). Specific binding, as assessed by affinity, can refer to a binding molecule with an affinity between an ABD and its cognate antigen or epitope in which the KD value is below 10<sup>-6</sup>M, 10<sup>-7</sup>M, 10<sup>-8</sup>M, 10<sup>-9</sup>M, or 1CT<sup>10</sup>M. Specific binding can also include recognition and binding of a biological molecule of interest (e.g., a polypeptide) while not specifically recognizing and binding other molecules in a sample, for example, a biological sample, which naturally includes a polypeptide of the present disclosure. In certain embodiments, specific binding refers to binding between an ABD, antibody, or antigen-binding fragment to an epitope or antigen or antigenic determinant in such a manner that binding can be displaced or competed with a second preparation of identical or similar epitope, antigen or antigenic determinant. </p><p id=\"p0084\" num=\"0084\">[00110] An ABD can be an antibody. The term \"antibody,\" as used herein, refers to a protein, or polypeptide sequence derived from an immunoglobulin molecule which specifically binds with an antigen. Antibodies can be polyclonal or monoclonal, multiple or single chain, or intact immunoglobulins, and may be derived from natural sources or from recombinant sources. Antibodies can be tetramers of immunoglobulin molecules. </p><p id=\"p0085\" num=\"0085\">[00111] An ABD can be an antigen-binding fragment of an antibody. As used herein, the term \"antigen -binding fragment\" refers to at least one portion of an intact antibody, or recombinant variants thereof, that is sufficient to confer recognition and specific binding of the antigen-binding fragment ",
    "n other multivalent embodiments, at least two of the plurality of ABDs have different recognition specificities. Such binding molecules are multivalent and \u201cmultispecific.\u201d In multivalent embodiments in which the ABDs collectively have two recognition specificities, the binding molecule is \u201cbispecific.\u201d In multivalent embodiments in which the ABDs collectively have three recognition specificities, the binding molecule is \u201ctrispecific.\u201d In multivalent embodiments in which the ABDs collectively have a plurality of recognition specificities for different epitopes present on the same antigen, the binding molecule is \u201cmultiparatopic.\u201d Multivalent embodiments in which the ABDs collectively recognize two epitopes on the same antigen are \u201cbiparatopic.\u201d </p><p id=\"p0087\" num=\"0087\">[00113] In various multivalent embodiments, multivalency of the binding molecule improves the avidity of the binding molecule for a specific target. As described herein, \u201cavidity\u201d refers to the overall strength of interaction between two or more molecules, e.g. a multivalent binding molecule for a specific target, wherein the avidity is the cumulative strength of interaction provided by the affinities of multiple ABDs. Avidity can be measured by the same methods as those used to determine affinity, as described above. In certain embodiments, the avidity of a binding molecule for a specific target is such that the interaction is a specific binding interaction, wherein the avidity between two molecules has a KD value below 1CT<sup>6</sup>M, 10<sup>_7</sup>M, 10<sup>_8</sup>M, 1CT<sup>9</sup>M, or 10<sup>-10</sup>M. In certain embodiments, the avidity of a binding molecule for a specific target has a KD value such that the interaction is a specific binding interaction, wherein the one or more affinities of individual ABDs do not have has a KD value that qualifies as specifically binding their respective antigens or epitopes on their own. In certain embodiments, the avidity is the cumulative strength of interaction provided by the affinities of multiple ABDs for separate antigens on a shared specific target or complex, such as separate antigens found on an individual cell. In certain embodiments, the avidity is the cumulative strength of interaction provided by the affinities of multiple ABDs for separate epitopes on a shared individual antigen. \n<!-- EPO <DP n=\"21\"/>-->\n[00114] As used herein, the term \"single-chain variable fragment\" or \"scFv\" refers to a fusion protein comprising at least one antigen-binding fragment comprising a variable region of a light chain and at least one antigen-binding fragment comprising a variable region of a heavy chain, wherein the light and heavy chain variable regions are contiguously linked via a short flexible polypeptide linker, capable of being expressed as a single chain polypeptide, and wherein the scFv retains the specificity of the intact antibody from which it is derived. Unless specified, as used herein an scFv may have the VL and VH variable regions in either order, e g., with respect to the N-terminal and C-terminal ends of the polypeptide, the scFv may comprise VU-linker-VH or may comprise VH-linker-VL. </p><p id=\"p0088\" num=\"0088\">[00115] As used herein, \u201cvariable region\u201d refers to a variable sequence that arises from a recombination event, for example, following ",
    "l, modulate, or otherwise inhibit one or more activities of the one or more activating chimeric receptors. For instance, if a healthy cell expresses both an antigen that is recognized by a tumor-targeting chimeric receptor and an antigen that is recognized by an inhibitory chimeric receptor, an immunoresponsive cell expressing the tumor antigen may bind to the healthy cell. In such a case, the inhibitory chimeric antigen will also bind its cognate ligand on the healthy cell and the inhibitory function of the inhibitory chimeric receptor will reduce, decrease, prevent, or inhibit the activation of the immunoresponsive cell via the tumor-targeting chimeric receptor (\u201cNOT-logic gating\u201d). In some embodiments, a chimeric inhibitory receptor of the present disclosure may inhibit one or more activities of a cell of the present disclosure (e.g., an immunoresponsive cell). In some embodiments, an immunoresponsive cell may comprise one or more tumor-targeting chimeric receptors and one or more inhibitory chimeric receptors that targets an antigen that is not expressed, or generally considered to be expressed, on the tumor (e.^.,VSIG2). Combinations of tumor-targeting chimeric receptors and inhibitory chimeric receptors in the same immunoresponsive cell may be used to reduce on-target off-tumor toxicity. </p><p id=\"p0131\" num=\"0131\">[00159] In some embodiments, the extracellular antigen-binding domain of a CAR of the present disclosure binds to one or more antigens (e.g., VSIG2) with a dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) of about 2 x 10<sup>7</sup>M or less, about 1 x 10<sup>7</sup>M or less, about 9 x 10<sup>8</sup>M or less, about 1 x 10<sup>8</sup>M or \n<!-- EPO <DP n=\"34\"/>-->\nless, about 9 x 10<sup>9</sup> M or less, about 5 x 10<sup>9</sup> M or less, about 4 x 10<sup>9</sup> M or less, about 3 x 10<sup>9</sup> M or less, about 2 x lO <sup>9</sup> M or less, or about 1 x 10<sup>9</sup> M or less.
