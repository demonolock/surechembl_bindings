    "of administered substance; and the provision of a method of cutaneous administration which when implemented with a hollow needle device, places the substance directly in the dermis to avoid metabolic degredation and/or immunologic activity which can occur in the epidermis.</p>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0036] In accordance with the present invention, it has been discovered that administration of a hydrophobic substance to the dermis results in improved systemic absorption of the substance. </p>[0037] The hydrophobic substances of the present invention tend to be of low water solubility or to be water insoluble, but soluble in non-polar solvents. Hydrophobicity of a substance can be assessed by standard methods such as, for example, by determining the oil-water distribution coefficient, preferably, the n-octanol/water distribution coefficient (see for example, Buchwald, Curr Med Chem 5:353-380, 1998). The oil-water distribution is the ratio of concentration of a compound in a water-immiscible non-polar solvent phase, such as n-octanol to the concentration in a water phase in contact with the solvent phase. Values are typically expressed as the log value of partition coefficient, logP, under appropriate physiologic conditions. Such conditions will depend upon the conditions of the target region of administration in the mammal including temperature, pH, concentration and the like. </p>[0038] For substances which are ionizable, the pK values or the negative log of the dissociation constant of such substances are a consideration and these values are sometimes determined at the same time that hydrophobicity is determined. This is because the partition coefficient is the ratio of concentration of a substance as the neutral molecule in a water-immiscible solvent to its concentration in an aqueous phase. Therefore, it is important to know the amount of neutral species present and this can be determined the pK of the substance and the pH of the aqueous solution. The pKa is the negative log of the equilibrium constant of an acid and the pKb is the negative log of the equilibrium constant of a base. As a practical matter, an acid having a pKa of one or more units greater than 7.4, i.e. 8.4 or greater, or a base having a pKb of one or more units less than 7.4, i.e. 6.4 or less are each predominantly in the form of the neutral molecule at a physiologic pH of 7.4 and this neutral form will partition substantially into the oil phase in an oil-water distribution test. </p>[0039] Another factor which will influence the measured value of logP, in addition to pH, is the particular non-polar solvent used in the oil phase. Typically, n-octanol is the non-polar solvent because this substance has a carbon to oxygen ratio, which is similar to that of lipid material in animal fats. Thus, the n-octanol partition coefficient is believed to reflect the distribution of a substance administered to a subject into regions of the body containing a significant amount of"
