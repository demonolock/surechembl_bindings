    " HUMAN MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES TO PROSTATE SPECIFIC MEMBRANE ANTIGEN</p>Background of the Invention Prostate cancer is a highly prevalent cancer and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among men. Treatments for prostate cancer include surgery, hormones, radiation and chemotherapy. There is little effective treatment for metastatic prostate disease, therefore the identification of genes and/or gene products that represent accurate diagnostic and prognostic markers, as well as targets for therapy is critical. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is one such cancer marker, the values of which are useful in the clinical diagnosis and staging of prostate cancer. However, PSA cannot differentiate benign prostatic hype\u03c6lasia (BPH) from prostatitis or prostate cancer in the range of 4- 10 ng/ml, thus necessitating a cytologic and/or histologic assessment to confirm the proper diagnosis (9). Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a 750 amino acid, type II transmembrane glycoprotein of approximately 110 kD that has 54% homology to the transferrin receptor. PSM' is an alternatively spliced form of PSMA which is localized in the cytoplasm. PSMA has 3 structural domains, including a 19 amino acid intracellular domain, a 24 amino acid transmembrane domain, and a 707 amino acid extracellular domain. The PSMA protein displays neurocarboxypeptidase and folate hydrolase activity, and therefore may be involved in the neuroendocrine regulation of prostate growth and differentiation (7).</p>Studies of PSMA expression indicate that it is a novel marker that is predominantly expressed by prostatic epithelial cells. Further, the expression of PSMA is increased in prostate cancer, especially in poorly differentiated, metastatic and hormone refractory carcinomas (8, 11). Therefore PSMA represents a valuable diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic target in prostate cancer. Low level expression of PSMA has also been observed in extraprostatic tissues such as the small bowel, salivary gland, duodenal mucosa, proximal renal tubules and brain (11). PSMA in the brain is involved in the conversion of the neurotransmitter NAAG to HAA and free glutamate, which may be important in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease \n\nand schizophrenia (12). PSMA expression is also observed in endothelial cells of capillary vessels in peritumoral and endotumoral areas of certain malignancies, including renal cell carcinomas and colo",
    " vivo and in vitro.</p>Isolated human antibodies of the invention encompass various antibody isotypes, such as IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgM, IgAl, IgA2, IgAsec, IgD, and IgE. Typically, they include IgGl (e.g., IgGlk) and IgM isotypes. The antibodies can be full-length (e.g., an IgGl or IgG4 antibody) or can include only an antigen-binding portion (e.g., a Fab, F(ab')2, Fv or a single chain Fv fragment). In one embodiment, the human antibodies are recombinant human antibodies. In another embodiment, the human antibodies are produced by a hybridoma which includes a B cell obtained from a transgenic non-human animal, e.g., a transgenic mouse, having a genome comprising a human heavy chain transgene and a human light chain transgene fused to an immortalized cell. In particular embodiments, the antibodies are produced by hybridomas referred to herein as 4A3, 7F12, 8A1 1, 16F9 and 8C12. \n\n In another embodiment, human anti-PSMA antibodies of the present invention can be characterized by one or more of the following properties: a) specificity for the PSMA; b) a binding affinity to PSMA with an affinity constant of at least about 10<sup>7</sup> M\" <sup>l</sup> , preferably about 10<sup>9</sup> M\" <sup>l</sup> , and more preferably, about 101 \u00b0 M\" 1 to 10<sup>1 1</sup> M\" <sup>l</sup> or higher; c) an association constant (K<sub>assoc</sub>) with PSMA of at least about 10<sup>3</sup>, more preferably about 10<sup>4</sup> and most preferably about 10<sup>5</sup> M^S<sup>\"1</sup>; d) a dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>i<sub>S</sub>) from PSMA of about 10\"3 s\"<sup>1</sup>, preferably about 10\"4 s\" 1 , more preferably, 10<sup>~</sup>5 s\" 1 , and most preferably, 10\"6 s\" 1 ; e) the ability to opsonize a cell expressing PSMA; or f) the ability to inhibit growth and/or mediate phagocytosis and killing of cells expressing PSMA (e.g., a tumor cell) in the presence of human effector cells at a concentration of about 10 \u03bcg/ml or less (e.g., in vitro). Examples of tumor cells which can be targeted by the human antibodies of the invention include, but are not limited to, prostate, renal, colon tumor cells.</p>In one embodiment, isolated human antibodies of the invention bind to PSMA antigen with an affinity constant of at least about 10? M\"<sup>1</sup>, preferably about 10^ M\"<sup>1</sup>, more preferably, about l\u03b8\" M\"<sup>1</sup>, and more preferably about 10^0 to 1011 M\"l or stronger, and are capable of inhibiting growth and/or mediating phagocytosis and killing of cells expressing PSMA by human effector cells, e.g., polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs), monocytes and macrophages, with an IC50 of about 1 x 10\" M or less, or at a concentration of about 10 \u03bcg/ml or less in vitro.</p>In another aspect, the invention provides nucleic acid molecules encoding the antibodies, or antigen-binding portions, of the invention. Accordingly, recombinant expression vectors which include the antibody-encoding nucleic acids of the invention, and host cells transfected with such vectors, are also encompassed by the invention, as are methods of making the antibodies of the invention by culturing these host cells.</p>In yet another aspect, the invention provides isolated B-cells from a transgenic non-human animal, e.g., a transgenic mouse, which are capable of expressing various isotypes (e.g., IgG, IgA and/or IgM) of human monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to PSMA. Preferably, the isolated B cells are obtained from a transgenic non- \n\nhuman animal, e.g., a transgenic mouse, which has been immunized with a purified or enriched preparation of PSMA antigen and/or cells expressing the PSMA. Preferably, the transgenic non-human animal, e.g., a transgenic mouse, has a genome comprising a human heavy chain transgene and a human light chain transgene. The isolated B-cells are then immortalized to provide a source (e.g., a hybridoma) of human monoclonal antibodies to PSMA.</p>Accordingly, the present invention also provides a hybridoma capable of producing human monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to PSMA. In one embodiment, the hybridoma includes a B cell obtained fr",
    "monoclonal antibodies having different specificities are combined in a well defined composition.</p>As used herein, \"specific binding\" refers to antibody binding to a predetermined antigen. Typically, the antibody binds with an affinity of at least about 1 x 10<sup>7</sup> M<sup>\"1</sup>, and binds to the predetermined antigen with an affinity that is at least two-fold greater than its affinity for binding to a non-specific antigen (e.g., BSA, casein) other than the predetermined antigen or a closely-related antigen. The phrases \"an antibody recognizing an antigen\" and \" an antibody specific for an antigen\" are used \n\ninterchangeably herein with the term \"an antibody which binds specifically to an antigen\".</p>As used herein, the term \"high affinity\" for an IgG antibody refers to a binding affinity of at least about 10<sup>7</sup>M<sup>_1</sup>, preferably at least about \n\n more preferably at least about 10<sup>10</sup>M<sup>\"</sup>',10<sup>11</sup>M<sup>\"1</sup>, 10<sup>12</sup>M<sup>\"</sup>' or greater, e.g., up tol0<sup>I3</sup>M<sup>\"</sup>' or greater. However, \"high affinity\" binding can vary for other antibody isotypes. For example, \"high affinity\" binding for an IgM isotype refers to a binding affinity of at least about 1 x 10<sup>7</sup>M<sup>~</sup>\\</p>The term \"K<sub>assoc</sub>\", as used herein, is intended to refer to the association constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction.</p>The term \"K^i<sub>s</sub>\", as used herein, is intended to refer to the dissociation constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction.</p>As used herein, \"isotype\" refers to the antibody class (e.g., IgM or IgGl) that is encoded by heavy chain constant region genes. As used herein, \"isotype switching\" refers to the phenomenon by which the class, or isotype, of an antibody changes from one Ig class to one of the other Ig classes.</p>As used herein, \"nonswitched isotype\" refers to the isotypic class of heavy chain that is produced when no isotype switching has taken place; the CH gene encoding the nonswitched isotype is typically the first CH gene immediately downstream from the functionally rearranged VDJ gene. Isotype switching has been classified as classical or non-classical isotype switching. Classical isotype switching occurs by recombination events which involve at least one switch sequence region in the transgene. Non- classical isotype switching may occur by, for example, homologous recombination between human \u03c3<sub>\u03bc</sub> and human \u2211<sub>\u03bc</sub> (\u03b4-associated deletion). Alternative non-classical switching mechanisms, such as intertransgene and/or interchromosomal recombination, among others, may occur and effectuate isotype switching.</p>As used herein, the term \"switch sequence\" refers to those DNA sequences responsible for switch recombination. A \"switch donor\" sequence, typically a \u03bc switch region, will be 5' (i.e., upstream) of the construct region to be deleted during the switch recombination. The \"switch acceptor\" region will "
