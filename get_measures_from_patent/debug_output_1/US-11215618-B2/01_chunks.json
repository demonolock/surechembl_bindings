Such bonds may be formed between at least two of the same or different atoms or ions as a result of redistribution of electron densities of those atoms or ions. For example, a B cell ligand may be coupled to a therapeutic agent as a fusion protein.</p>In some embodiments, a therapeutic agent comprises a radioactive isotope such as an \u03b1-, \u03b2-, or \u03b3-emitter, or a \u03b2- and \u03b3-emitter.</p>In some embodiments, a therapeutic agent comprises a chemotherapy. Chemotherapeutic agents include, for example, including alkylating agents, anthracyclines, cytoskeletal disruptors (Taxanes), epothilones, histone deacetylase inhibitors, inhibitors of topoisomerase I, inhibitors of topoisomerase II, kinase inhibitors, nucleotide analogs and precursor analogs, peptide antibiotics, platinum-based agents, retinoids, vinca alkaloids and derivatives thereof.

    " or overnight.24. Spin the PEG precipitation at 12,000 g rpm for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0 C.25. Decant and discard the supernatant, respin briefly, and remove the residual supernatant with a pipette.26. Suspend the pellet in 1 ml of TBS. Transfer the suspension to a tube and spin for 5 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. to pellet residual cells.27. Transfer the supernatant to a fresh microcentrifuge tube and reprecipitate with 1/6 volume of 20% PEG/2.5 M NaCl.28. Incubate for 15-60 minutes on ice.29. Microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0 C.30. Discard the supernatant, respin briefly, and remove residual supernatant with a micropipet.31. Suspend the pellet in 200 \u03bcl of TBS.32. Microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 1 minute to pellet any remaining insoluble matter.33. Transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube. This is the amplified eluate.34. Perform a second and third rounds of panning.\n\nPlaque Amplification for ELISA and Sequencing:\n1. Dilute an overnight culture of ER2738 1:100 in LB. Dispense 1 ml of diluted culture into 96-well deepwell plates (#260251, Thermo Scientific). For each antibody to be characterized use 2 plates.2. Stab a blue plaque from a phage plates.3. Use a microplate tape sealer to cover the plates.4. Incubate the plates at 37\u00b0 C. with shaking for 4.5-5 hours.5. Centrifuge plates at 250 g for 10 minutes at RT.6. Carefully collect 700 mkl of the supernatant and transfer to a fresh plate.7. This is the amplified phage stock and can be stored at 4 C for two days.\n\nPhage ELISA Binding Assay:\n1. Coat ELISA plate wells with 100 \u03bcl of 100 \u03bcg/ml of malignant BCR antibody or negative-control antibody in 0.1 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, pH 8.6.2. Incubate overnight at 4 C.3. Wash each plate 5 times with TBST.4. Block ELISA plate wells by 5% Milk in PBST.5. Incubate 1 hour at RT.6. Wash each plate 5 times with TBST.7.
