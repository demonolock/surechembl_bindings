    ". Compounds selected or optimized using the instant methods can be used to treat subjects that would benefit from administration of such a compound, e.g., human subjects.</p>Candidate compounds that can be tested in the methods of the present invention are bispecific compounds. As used herein, the term \u201cbispecific compound\u201d includes compounds having two different binding specificities. Exemplary bispecific compounds include, e.g., bispecific antibodies, heteropolymers, and antigen-based heteropolymers.</p>Bispecific molecules that can be tested in the present invention preferably include a binding moiety that is specific for CR1, preferably human CR1, crosslinked to a second binding moiety specific for a targeted agent (e.g. a distinct antibody or an antigen). Examples of binding moieties specific for CR1 include, but are not limited to, CR1 ligands, e.g. C3b or, in preferred embodiments, antibodies to CR1. Examples of monoclonal antibodies specific for CR1 include, but are not limited to, any one of the following: 1B4, HB8592, 7G9, 3D9, E-11, 57F and YZ1. HB8592 and 1B4 are disclosed in Taylor et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., 88:3305-3309 (1991) and Reist et al., Eur. J. Immunol., 23:3021-3027 (1993). Antibodies 3D9 and E-11 are described in Edberg et al., (1992) Eur J Immunol. 22: 1333-9.</p>In another embodiment, novel CR1 binding molecules can be identified based on their ability to bind to CR1. For example, libraries of compounds or small molecules can be tested cell-free binding assay. Any number of test compounds, e.g., peptidomimetics, small molecules or other drugs can be used for testing and can be obtained using any of the numerous approaches in combinatorial library methods known in the art, including: biological libraries; spatially addressable parallel solid phase or solution phase libraries; synthetic library methods requiring deconvolution; the \u2018one-bead one-compound\u2019 library method; and synthetic library methods using affinity chromatography selection. The biological library approach is limited to peptide libraries, while the other four approaches are applicable to peptide, non-peptide oligomer or small molecule libraries of compounds (Lam, K. S. (1997) Anticancer Drug Des. 12:145).</p>Examples of methods for the synthesis of molecular libraries can be found in the art, for example in: DeWitt et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90:6909; Erb et al. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:11422; Zuckermann et al. (1994). J. Med. Chem. 37:2678; Cho et al. (1993) Science 261:1303; Carrell et al. (1994) Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 33:2059; Carell et al. (1994) Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 33:2061; and in Gallop et al. (1994) J. Med. Chem. 37:1233.</p>Libraries of compounds may be presented in solution (e.g., Houghten (1992) Biotechniques 13:412-421), or on beads (Lam (1991) Nature 354:82-84), chips (Fodor (1993) Nature 364:555-556), bacteria (Ladner U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409), spores (Ladner U.S. Pat. No. '409), plasmids (Cull et al. ",
    "the optical phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) can be used as an indication of real-time reactions between biological molecules.</p>The cell-free assays of the present invention are amenable to use of both soluble and/or membrane-bound forms of proteins. In the case of cell-free assays in which a membrane-bound form a protein is used it may be desirable to utilize a solubilizing agent such that the membrane-bound form of the protein is maintained in solution. Examples of such solubilizing agents include non-ionic detergents such as n-octylglucoside, n-dodecylglucoside, n-dodecylmaltoside, octanoyl-N-methylglucamide, decanoyl-N-methylglucamide, Triton\u00ae X-100, Triton\u00ae X-114, Thesit\u00ae, Isotridecypoly(ethylene glycol ether)<sub>n</sub>, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylamminio]-1-propane sulfonate (CHAPS), 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylamminio]-2-hydroxy-1-propane sulfonate (CHAPSO), or N-dodecyl=N,N-dimethyl-3-ammonio-1-propane sulfonate.</p>Suitable assays are known in the art that allow for the detection of protein-protein interactions (e.g., immunoprecipitations, two-hybrid assays and the like). By performing such assays in the presence and absence of test compounds, these assays can be used to identify compounds that modulate (e.g., inhibit or enhance) the interaction of a protein of the invention with a target molecule(s).</p>Determining the ability of the protein to bind to or interact with a target molecule can be accomplished, e.g., by direct binding. In a direct binding assay, the protein could be coupled with a radioisotope or enzymatic label such that binding of the protein to a target molecule can be determined by detecting the labeled protein in a complex. For example, proteins can be labeled with <sup>125</sup>I, <sup>35</sup>S, <sup>14</sup>C, or <sup>3</sup>H, either directly or indirectly, and the radioisotope detected by direct counting of radioemmission or by scintillation counting. Alternatively, molecules can be enzymatically labeled with, for example, horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, or luciferase, and the enzymatic label detected by determination of conversion of an appropriate substrate to product.</p>Typically, it will be desirable to immobilize either a protein of the invention or its binding protein to facilitate separation of complexes from uncomplexed forms of one or both of the proteins, as well as to accommodate automation of the assay. Binding to an upstream or downstream binding element, in the presence and absence of a candidate agent, can be accomplished in any vessel suitable for containing the reactants. Examples include microtitre plates, test tubes, and micro-centrifuge tubes. In one embodiment, a fusion protein can be provided which adds a domain that allows the protein to be bound to a matrix. For example, glutathione-S-transferase/CR1 (GST/CR1) fusion proteins can be adsorbed onto glutathione sepharose beads (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, Mo.) or glutathione derivatized microtitre plates, wh"
