    " or animal body or of one of its parts that impairs normal functioning, is typically manifested by distinguishing signs and symptoms, and causes the human or animal to have a reduced duration or quality of life. </p>[0144] A \"cognitive disorder,\" as used herein refers to a mental health disorder in which loss of cognitive function is the primary symptom, and which primarily affects learning, memory, perception, and/or problem solving. Cognitive disorders include amnesia, dementia, and delirium. Causes may include damage to the memory portions of the brain, whether from trauma or chemotherapy. </p> [0145] The term \"combination therapy\" means the administration of two or more therapeutic agents to treat a therapeutic condition or disorder described in the present disclosure. Such administration enc ompasses co-administration of these therapeutic agents in a substantially simultaneous manner, such as in a single capsule having a fixed ratio of active ingredients or in multiple, separate capsules for each active ingredient. In addition, such administration also encompasses use of each type of therapeutic agent in a sequential manner. In either case, the treatment regimen will provide beneficial effects of the drug combination in treating the conditions or disorders described herein. </p> [0146] \"DLK binder\" is used herein to refer to a compound that exhibits an \u00be with respect to DLK of no more than about 100 \u03bc\u039c and more typically not more than about 50 \u03bc\u039c, as measured in the DLK binding assay described generally herein. The DLK binding assay measures the Kd (dissociation constant) for the binding of a compound with the active site of DLK. Certain compounds disclosed herein have been discovered to bind to DLK. In certain embodiments, compounds will exhibit an Kd with respect to DLK of no more than about 10 \u03bc\u039c; in further embodiments, compounds will exhibit a Ka with respect to DLK of no more than about 1 \u03bc\u039c; in yet further embodiments, compounds will exhibit a Kj with respect to DLK of not more than about 0.1 \u03bc\u039c; in yet further embodiments, compounds will exhibit a Kd with respect to DLK of not more than about 10 nM, as measured in the DLK assay described herein. \n\n [0147] The phrase \"therapeutically effective\" is intended to qualify the amount of active ingredients used in the treatment of a disease or disorder or on the effecting of a clinical endpoint. </p> [0148] The term \"therapeutically acceptable\" refers to those compounds (or salts, prodrugs, tautomers, zwitterionic forms, etc.) which are suitable for use in contact with the tissues of patients without undue toxicity, irritation, and allergic response, are commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and are effective for their intended use. </p>[0149] As used herein, reference to \"treatment\" of a patient is intended to include prophylaxis. Treatment may also be preemptive in nature, i.e., it may include prevention of disease. Prevention of a disease may involve complete protection from disease, for example as in the case of prevention of infection with a pathogen, or may involve prevention of disease progression. For example, prevention of a disease may not mean complete foreclosure of any effect related to the diseases at any level, but instead may mean prevention of the symptoms of a disease to a clinically significant or detectable level. Prevention of diseases may also mean prevention of progression of a disease to a later stage of the disease. </p>[0150] The term \"patient\" is generally synonymous with the term \"subject\" and includes all mammals including humans.

NaCl, dried over MgS04, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified via SiO<sub>2</sub> gel chromatography (0% to 5% MeOH in DCM) to give the title compound as a yellow solid (8.0 mg, 16%). </p> [0359] MS (ES<sup>+</sup>) C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>19</sub>F3N<sub>4</sub>O requires: 340, found: 341 [M+H]<sup>+</sup>. </p>[0360] <sup>1</sup>H NMR (600 MHz, CDCI<sub>3</sub>-d) \u03b4 8.55 (appar s, 1H), 8.35 (appar s, 1H), 7.28 (s, 1H), 5.48 (br s, 2H), 4.80-4.65 (m, 2H), 2.68-2.45 (m, 4H), 2.06-1.75 (m, 4H), 1.03 (t, J = 7.60 Hz, 3H). </p> [0361] For compounds which are disclosed as a/b pairs, for example, 19a and 19b, the \"a\" designation refers to the first-eluting compound, and the \"b\" designation refers to the last- eluting compound. Such compounds are typically stereoisomers, for example epimers, \n\n having (R) or (S) configuration at a stereocenter. Each compound is individually exemplified herein, but the absolute configuration may not yet have been characterized and assigned. Both a and b ((R) and (S)), as well as racemic mixtures thereof, are contemplated within the scope of the invention. </p></p>\n Biological Activity Assays </p>[0362] Compounds described herein have been shown to bind DLK in vitro, and to inhibit phosphorylation of a downstream molecular target in a cellular assay. </p>DLK Kd determinations </p> [0363] The DLK dissociation constants (Kj) have been determined in the VJNOMEscan KdELECT Service at DiscoveRx. </p> [0364] A fusion protein of full length of human DLK (amino acids 1 - 859) and the DNA binding domain of NFkB was expressed in transiently transfected HEK293 cells. From these HEK 293 cells, extracts were prepared in M-PER extraction buffer (Pierce) in the presence of Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Complete (Roche) and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail Set II (Merck) per manufacturers' instructions. The DLK fusion protein was labeled with a chimeric double-stranded DNA tag containing the NFkB binding site (5 -GGGAATTCCC- 3') fused to an amplicon for qPCR readout, which was added directly to the expression extract (the final concentration of DNA-tag in the binding reaction is 0.1 nM). </p>[0365] Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynal M280) were treated with a biotinylated small molecule ligand for 30 minutes at room temperature to generate affinity resins the binding assays. The liganded beads were blocked with excess biotin and washed with blocking buffer (SeaBlock (Pierce), 1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, 1 mM DTT) to remove unbound ligand and to reduce nonspecific binding. </p> [0366] The binding reaction was assembled by combining 16 \u03bc\u0390 of DNA-tagged kinase extract, 3.8 \u03bc\u0390 liganded affinity beads, and 0.18 \u03bc\u0390 test compound (PBS/0.05% Tween 20/10 mM DTT/0.1% BSA/2 \u03bcg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA)]. Extracts were used directly in binding assays without any enzyme purification steps at a &gt;10,000-fold overall stock dilution (final DNA-tagged enzyme concentration &lt;0.1 nM). Extracts were loaded with DNA-tag and diluted into the binding reaction in a two step process. First extracts were diluted 1 : 100 in lx binding buffer (PBS/0.05% Tween 20/10 mM DTT/0.1% BSA/2 \u03bc^\u03b9\u03b7\u0390 sonicated salmon sperm DNA) containing 10 nM DNA-tag. This dilution was allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for 15 minutes and then subsequently diluted 1 : 100 in lx binding buffer. Test compounds were prepared as 11 lx stocks in 100% DMSO. Kjs were determined using an 11- point 3-fold compound dilution series with three DMSO control points. All compounds for Kd measurements are distributed by acoustic transfer (non-contact dispensing) in 100% DMSO. The compounds were then diluted directly into the assays such that the final concentration of DMSO was 0.9%. All reactions performed in polypropylene 384-well plates. \n\n Each was a final volume of 0.02 mL. Assays were incubated with shaking for 1 hour at room temperature. Then the beads were pelleted and washed with wash buffer (lx PBS, 0.05% Tween 20) to remove displaced kinase and test compound. The washed based were re- suspended in elution buffer (lx PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.5 \u03bc\u039c non-biotinylated affinity ligand) and incubated at room temperature with shaking for 30 minutes. The kinase concentration in the eluates was measured by qPCR. qPCR reactions were assembled by adding 2.5 \u03bcL, of kinase eluate to 7.5 \u03bcL, of qPCR master mix containing 0.15 \u03bc\u039c amplicon primers and 0.15 \u03bc\u039c amplicon probe. The qPCR protocol consisted of a 10 minute hot start at 95 \u00b0C, followed by 35 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 seconds, 60 \u00b0C for 1 minute. </p>[0367] Test compound Handling. Test compounds were prepared as 11 lx stocks in 100% DMSO. KdS were determined using an 11 -point 3-fold compound dilution series with three DMSO control points. All compounds for Kd measurements are distributed by acoustic transfer (non-contact dispensing) in 100% DMSO. The compounds were then diluted directly into the assays such that the final concentration of DMSO was 0.9%. The KdS were determined using a compound top concentration of 30,000 nM. Kd measurements were performed in duplicate. </p> [0368] Binding Constant(Kd) calculation. Binding constants (Kd<sub>s</sub>) were calculated with a standard dose-response curve using the Hill equation: \n\n </p> [0369] The Hill Slope was set to -1. Curves were fitted using a non-linear least square fit with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (Levenberg, K., A method for the solution of certain non-linear problems in least squares, Q. Appl. Math. 2, 164-168 (1944)). See also Fabian, M.A. et al. A small molecule-kinase interaction map for clinical kinase inhibitors. Nat. Biotechnol. 23, 329-336 (2005); Wodicka, L.M. et al.

Compounds disclosed herein, particularly (but not exclusively) those with with lower dissociation constants, can be expected to inhibit target activity and to be useful in the treatment of DLK-mediated disease. </p>Phospho-cJun Cellular Assay \n\n [0371] HEK293 cells stably transfected with a Dox-inducible human DLK were plated into a 384-well plate in 20 \u03bc\u0390 (40,000 cells/well) of DMEM medium (without phenol red) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1.5 \u03bcg/ml doxycycline and \u03bcg/ml puromycin. The cells as negative control were grown in the absence of doxycycline. The plate was incubated at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 20 h, before DMSO (control) or compounds diluted in medium were added. The cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for an additional 5 h, "
