{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\n[0367] Test compound Handling. Test compounds were prepared as 11 lx stocks in 100% DMSO. KdS were determined using an 11 -point 3-fold compound dilution series with three DMSO control points. All compounds for Kd measurements are distributed by acoustic transfer (non-contact dispensing) in 100% DMSO. The compounds were then diluted directly into the assays such that the final concentration of DMSO was 0.9%. The KdS were determined using a compound top concentration of 30,000 nM. \n\n\nNote that there is only one sentence that meets the criteria, which mentions the Kd metric with a specific numeric value (30,000 nM) and unit (nM). However, it does not mention a specific molecule name or ID. If you would like to extract sentences with more context, I can try to provide more information."}
