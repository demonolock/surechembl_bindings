First, MRAH-G1d/MRAL-k0 having the sequence of naturally occurring IgG1 and the altered form MRAH-G1dP17/MRAL-k0//H54-G1dN17/L28-k0 after Fab arm exchange were tested for their binding to human FcRn according to the method of Reference Example 5. The results of analyzing binding to human FcRn are shown in Table 7.</p>TABLE 7KD for human AbbreviationFcRn (M)G1d2.1E\u221206G1dP17/N171.9E\u221206</p>The results shown in Table 7 demonstrated that the altered form MRAH-G1dP I7/MRAL-k0//H54-G1dN17/L28-k0 prepared by Fab arm exchange has human FcRn-binding activity equivalent to that of naturally occurring IgG1.</p>Next, the binding activity against human FcgR was evaluated according to the method of Reference Example 4. In this context, MRAH-G1 d/MRAL-k0 having the sequence of naturally occurring IgG1, the altered form MRAH-G1dP17/MRAL-k0//H54-G1dN17/L28-k0 after Fab arm exchange, two types of homo variants before Fab arm exchange reaction (MRAH-G1dP17/MRAL-k0 and H54-G1dN17/L28-k0), and two types of homo variants lacking the alteration V397Y to destabilize CH3 domains (MRAH-G1dP1/MRAL-k0 and H54-G1dN1/L28-k0) were evaluated together. In Table 8, KD fold hFcgRIa, KD fold hFcgRIIaR, KD fold hFcgRIIaH, KD fold hFcgRIIb, and KD fold hFcgRIIIaV are values that indicate the relative binding activity of each altered form when KD of G1d for each FcgR is defined as 1.</p>TABLE 8KD forKD forKD forKD forKD forIntroducedhFcgRIahFcgRIIaRhFcgRIIaHhFcgRIIbhFcgRIIIaVAbbreviationalteration(M)(M)(M)(M)(M)G1d1.6E\u2212101.6E\u2212068.7E\u2212076.2E\u2212065.1E\u221207G1dP17D356K + V397Y2.6E\u2212106.5E\u2212074.1E\u2212072.7E\u2212062.5E\u221207G1dN17K439E + V397Y1.3E\u2212105.9E\u2212073.9E\u2212072.4E\u2212062.0E\u221207G1dP1D356K1.6E\u2212101.7E\u2212069.9E\u2212077.0E\u2212065.1E\u221207G1dN1K439E2.5E\u2212101.5E\u2212069.6E\u2212077.1E\u2212064.5E\u221207G1dP17/N17D356K + V397Y/1.4E\u2212105.8E\u2212073.7E\u2212072.5E\u2212062.1E\u221207K439E + V397YKD foldKD foldKD foldKD foldKD foldAbbreviationhFcgRIahFcgRIIaRhFcgRIIaHhFcgRIIbhFcgRIIIaVG1d11111G1dP170.62.42.12.32.0G1dN171.32.62.22.62.5G1dP11.00.90.90.91.0G1dN10.61.00.90.91.1G1dP17/N171.12.72.32.52.5</p>The binding of the altered form G1dP17/N17 after Fab arm exchange compared with the naturally occurring antibody was enhanced by 1.1 times for hFcgRIa, 2.7 times for hFcgRIIaR, 2.3 times for hFcgRIIaH, 2.5 times for hFcgRIIb, and 2.5 times for hFcgRIIIaV. In this context, the homo variants G1dP1 and G1dN1 before the introduction of CH3 domain-destabilizing V397Y bound to each FcgR with activity equivalent to that of the naturally occurring antibody. Also, the homo variants derived therefrom by the introduction of V397Y (G1dP17 and G1dN17) exhibited enhanced binding to each FcgR.

The running buffer used was HBS-EP+ (GE Healthcare Japan Corp.). The assay temperature was set to 25\u00b0 C. The sensor chips used were chips prepared by immobilizing the antigenic peptide, Protein A (Thermo Fisher Scientific K.K.), Protein A/G (Thermo Fisher Scientific K.K.), or Protein L (ACTIGEN or BioVision) onto Series S Sensor Chip CM5 (GE Healthcare Japan Corp.) or Series S Sensor Chip CM4 (GE Healthcare Japan Corp.) by the amine coupling method, or by immobilizing the antigenic peptide biotinylated in advance onto Series S Sensor Chip SA (certified) (GE Healthcare Japan Corp.) through interaction.</p>The antibody of interest was captured onto these sensor chips and allowed to interact with the Fc\u03b3 receptor diluted with a running buffer. The binding amount to the antibody was measured and compared among antibodies. Since the binding amount of the Fc\u03b3 receptor depends on the amount of the captured antibody, a correction value determined by dividing the binding amount of the Fc\u03b3 receptor by the amount of each captured antibody was used in the comparison. The antibody captured on the sensor chip was washed off through the reaction of 10 mM glycine-HCl (pH 1.5) to regenerate the sensor chip, which was repetitively used.</p>In order to calculate the KD value of each altered antibody for Fc\u03b3R, kinetic analysis was conducted according to the following method: first, the antibody of interest was captured onto these chips and allowed to interact with the Fc\u03b3 receptor diluted with a running buffer. For the obtained sensorgram, the assay results were globally fit into the 1:1 Langmuir binding model using Biacore Evaluation Software to calculate an association rate constant ka (L/mol/s) and a dissociation rate constant kd (1/s). From these values, the dissociation constant KD (mol/L) was calculated.</p>(4-2) Method for Preparing FcRn and Method for Analyzing Interaction Between Altered Antibody and FcRnFcRn is a complex of FcRn and \u03b22-microglobulin. Oligo DNA primers were prepared on the basis of the published gene sequence of human FcRn (J Exp Med. 1994 Dec. 1; 180 (6): 2377-81). The DNA fragment containing the whole gene encoding the FcRn was prepared by PCR using the prepared primers and human cDNA (Human Placenta Marathon-Ready cDNA, Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) as a template. A DNA fragment encoding the extracellular domain containing a signal region (Met1 to Leu290) was amplified by PCR using the obtained DNA fragment as a template and inserted to expression vectors for mammalian cells. Likewise, oligo DNA primers were prepared on the basis of the published gene sequence of human 132-microglobulin (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 99 (26): 16899-16903 (2002)). The DNA fragment containing the whole gene encoding the P2-microglobulin was prepared by PCR using the prepared primers and human cDNA (Human Placenta Marathon-Ready cDNA, Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) as a template. A DNA fragment encoding the whole protein containing a signal region (Met1 to Met119) was amplified by PCR using the obtained DNA fragment as a template and inserted to expression vectors for mammalian cells.</p>Soluble human FcRn was expressed by the following procedures: the plasmids constructed for expressing human FcRn (SEQ ID NO: 30) and 12-microglobulin (SEQ ID NO: 31) were transferred to cells of a human embryonic kidney cancer cell-derived cell line HEK293H (Invitrogen Corp.) by lipofection using PEI (Polysciences, Inc.). The obtained culture supernatant was recovered and purified using IgG Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences Corp.). Then, FcRn was further purified using HiTrap Q HP (GE Healthcare Japan Corp.) (J Immunol. 2002 Nov. 1; 169 (9): 5171-80).</p>A system using an antibody immobilized on the sensor chip described in J Immunol. 2009; 182 (12): 7663-71 and human FcRn as an analyte has been reported as an assay system for evaluating the interaction between the antibody and FcRn using Biacore. For this purpose, human FcRn was prepared as described in Reference Example 4. This system was used to evaluate the binding activity (dissociation constant KD) of Fv4-IgG1, Fv4-IgG1-v1, and Fv4-IgG1-v2 against human FcRn at pH 6.0 and pH 7.4. Each antibody as a test substance was directly immobilized onto Series S Sensor Chip CM5 and subjected to the test. The immobilization of the antibody to the sensor chip was carried out using 50 mmol/L sodium phosphate, 150 mmol/L NaCl, and 0.05% (v/v %) Surfactant P20 (pH 6.0) as a running buffer and an amine coupling kit according to the manual of the manufacturer in order to attain 500 RU as the target amount of the antibody immobilized.</p>The assay was conducted by use of the prepared sensor chip using 50 mmol/L sodium phosphate/150 mmol/L NaCl, and 0.05% Surfactant P20 (pH 6.0) or 50 mmol/L sodium phosphate. 150 mmol/L NaCl, and 0.05% Surfactant P20 (pH 7.4) as a running buffer. The assay was conducted at 25\u00b0 C. for all samples. The diluted solution of the human FcRn or a running buffer (as a control solution) was injected thereto at a flow rate of 5 \u03bcL/min for 10 minutes so that the human FcRn was allowed to interact with the antibody on the sensor chip. Then, a running buffer was injected thereto at a flow rate of 5 \u03bcL/min for 1 minute. After observation of the dissociation of FcRn, 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl/150 mmol/L NaCl (pH 8.1) were injected at a flow rate of 30 \u03bcL/min for 15 seconds, and this operation was repeated twice to regenerate the sensor chip.</p>In order to calculate the KD value of each altered antibody for FcRn, kinetic analysis was conducted according to the following method: first, the antibody of interest was captured onto these chips and allowed to interact with FcRn diluted with a running buffer. For the obtained sensorgram, the assay results were globally fit into the 1:1 Langmuir binding model using Biacore Evaluation Software to calculate an association rate constant ka (L/mol/s) and a dissociation rate constant kd (1/s). From these values, the dissociation constant KD (mol/L) was calculated.</p>(4-3) Method for Preparing mFc\u03b3R and Method for Analyzing Interaction Between Altered Antibody and mFc\u03b3RThe extracellular domain of each mouse Fc\u03b3R was prepared by the following method: first, the gene of the Fc\u03b3R extracellular domain was synthesized by a method generally known to those skilled in the art. For this synthesis, the sequence of each Fc\u03b3R was prepared on the basis of the information registered in NCBI. Specifically, mFc\u03b3RI was prepared on the basis of the sequence of NCBI Reference Sequence: NP_034316.1; mFc\u03b3RII was prepared on the basis of the sequence of NCBI Reference Sequence: NP_034317.1; mFc\u03b3RIII was prepared on the basis of the sequence of NCBI Reference Sequence: NP_034318.2; and mFc\u03b3RIV was prepared on the basis of the sequence of NCBI Reference Sequence: NP_653142.2. These sequences were C-terminally tagged with a His tag sequence.</p>Each obtained gene fragment was inserted to expression vectors for animal cells to prepare expression vectors. The prepared expression vectors were transiently transferred to human embryonic kidney cancer cell-derived FreeStyle 293 cells (Invitrogen Corp.) to express the protein of interest. The obtained culture supernatant was recovered and then passed through a 0.22 \u03bcm filter to obtain a culture supernatant. The obtained culture supernatant was purified, as a rule, by the following 4 steps: ion-exchange column chromatography as step 1, affinity column chromatography for the His tag (HisTrap "
