After filtration and evaporation of the solvent, 200 ml of DCM is added. The DCM solution is washed with brine, dried (Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) and concentrated to approximately 55 ml. The concentrated solution is added dropwise to 600 ml of 0.5N HCl in ether solution. The solid is filtered off and washed with ether and then dissolved in water. The resulting aqueous solution is basified with 2N NaOH and extracted with DCM. The DCM layers are combined, washed with brine (2\u00d7200 mL) and dried (Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>). Evaporation of the solvent and chromatography of the residue over silica gel gives 4-((6bR,10aS)-3-methyl-2,3,6b,9,10,10a-hexahydro-1H-pyrido-[3\u2032,4\u2032:4,5]-pyrrolo[1,2,3-de]quinoxalin-8-(7H)-yl)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-butanone.</p>Alternative to the use of dioxane, the reaction may be carried out in 3-pentanone. To a 5 L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a N<sub>2 </sub>inlet, a reflux condenser, and a temperature probe is charged with 230 g of (6bR,10aS)-3-methyl-2,3,6b,7,8,9,10,10a-octahydro-1H-pyrido-[3\u2032,4\u2032:4,5]-pyrrolo[1,2,3-de]quinoxaline (1 mol), 249.78 g of KI (1.5 mol, 1.5 eq.), 194.12 g of <sup>i</sup>Pr<sub>2</sub>NEt (1.5 mol, 1.5 eq.), 301.76 g of 4-chloro-4\u2032-fluorobutyrophenone (1.5 mol, 1.5 eq.), and 2300 mL of 3-pentanone. The resultant mixture is then heated at 95\u00b0 C. (internal temperature) for 17 h, and then is checked by HPLC for reaction completion. The batch is then cooled to ca. 10\u00b0 C. with an ice bath, and then is added 5% NaOH solution (2300 mL). The separated aqueous layer is then extracted with EtOAc (2300 mL). The combined organic layer is filtered through a pad of silica gel (115 g) that is pre-packed with EtOAc. The silica gel is then flushed with EtOAc (2300 mL). The combined filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure to afford a dark brown liquid. To the liquid is then added EtOAc (2300 mL) and 1.5 N HCl solution (2300 mL). The batch is stirred at RT for ca. 20 min, and layers are cut. The separated organic layer is extracted with 1.5 N HCl solution (1150 mL), and the layers are separated. The combined aqueous layer is cooled in an ice bath to about 10\u00b0 C. and EtOAc (2300 mL) is added. To the stirring mixture is then added 25% NaOH solution (1000 mL) through an addition funnel while maintaining the internal temperature under 25\u00b0 C. The resultant mixture is stirred in an ice bath for ca. 20 min, and the layers are separated. The aqueous layer shows a pH of between 11 and 12 by pH paper. The aqueous layer is back extracted with EtOAc (1150 mL), and the layers are cut. The combined organic layer is washe"
