{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n* In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein has a dissociation constant (Kd) of equal to or less than about 100 nM, 10 nM, 1 nM, 0.1 nM, 0.01 nM, or 0.001 nM (e.g. 10<sup>\u22127</sup>M or less, from 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>M to 10<sup>\u221213</sup>M, from 10<sup>\u22128</sup>M to 10<sup>\u221213 </sup>M or from 10<sup>\u22129</sup>M to 10<sup>\u221213 </sup>M).\n* For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% polysorbate 20 (TWEEN-20\u2122) surfactant (PBST) at 25\u00b0 C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 \u03bcl/min.\n* The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) is calculated as the ratio k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>.\n* If the on-rate exceeds 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> by the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation=295 nm; emission=340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25\u00b0 C. of a 20 nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow equipped spectrophometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-AMINCO\u2122 spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stirred cuvette.\n* Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, to 5 \u03bcg/ml (~0.2 \u03bcM) before injection at a flow rate of 5 \u03bcl/minute to achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled protein."}
