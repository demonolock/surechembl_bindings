Method B.</p>[0063] To a solution of 2-hydroxy-amide (1.0 mmol) in a mixture of toluene (3 mL) and ethyl acetate (3 mL) a solution of NaBr (0.11 g, 1.1 mmol) in water (0.5 mL) was added followed by AcNH-TEMPO (2.2 mg, 0.01 mmol). To the resulting biphasic system, which was cooled at 0 <sup>0</sup>C, an aqueous solution of 0.35 M NaOCl (3.1 mL, 1.1 mmol) containing NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (0.25 g, 3 mmol) was added dropwise under vigorous stirring, at 0 \u00b0C over a period of 1 h. After the mixture had been stirred for a further 15 min at 0 \u00b0C, ethyl acetate (10 mL) and H<sub>2</sub>O (10 mL) were added. The aqueous layer was separated and washed with ethyl acetate (20 mL). The combined organic layers were washed consecutively with 5% aqueous \n\n citric acid (10 mL) containing KI (0.04 g), 10% aqueous Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (10 mL), and brine and dried over Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. The solvents were evaporated under reduced pressure and the residue was purified by column-chromatography using chloroform as eluent.</p>Example 16 : (S)-Methyl-2-(3-methyl-2-(2-oxohexadecanamido)butanamido)-acetate (4b).</p>[0064] Yield 73%; White solid; mp 118-119 <sup>0</sup>C; [\u03b1]<sub>D</sub> = -20.9 (c 1 CHC13); <sup>1</sup>H NMR (200 MHz, CDC13) \u03b4 7.46 (d, J = 9.2 Hz, IH), 6.53-6.37 (m, IH), 4.24 (dd, Ji = 6.6 Hz, J<sub>2</sub> = 9.2 Hz, IH), 4.05 (dd, Ji = 5.2, J<sub>2</sub> = 9.6 Hz, 2H), 3.77 (s, 3H), 2.91 (t, J = 7.4 Hz, 2H), 2.22 (m, IH), 1.61 (m, 2H), 1.26 (br s, 22H), 0.98 (t, J = 5.8 Hz, 6H), 0.88 (t, J = 6.6 Hz, 3H); <sup>13</sup>C NMR (50 MHz, CDC13) \u03b4 198.3, 170.9, 170.0, 160.2, 58.6, 52.5, 41.1, 36.8, 31.9, 31.0, 29.6, 29.4, 29.3, 29.0, 23.1, 22.7, 19.2, 18.0, 14.1; Anal.
