{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that contain all four required components: a specific molecule name, ID or other identifier, a bioactivity metric, a specific numeric value for that metric, and a unit for that value. The text appears to be a collection of chemical synthesis procedures and analytical data, but it does not include bioactivity metrics such as IC50, Ki, Kd, EC50, pIC50, pEC50, pKi, or pKd."}
