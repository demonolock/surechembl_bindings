    "fferent degrees. At 1 mM curcumin, PhK, pp60s-src, PkC, PkA, AK and cPK were inhibited by 98%, 40%, 15%, 10%, 1% and 0.5%, respectively. \n\n\n\n  However, higher concentrations of curcumin inhibited 98%, 95%, 46%, 49%, 17% and 2% of the activity of these kinases, respectively. The inhibitory effect was dose-dependent. \n\n\n\n   Among the kinases examined, PhK was most completely inhibited by the lowest concentration of curcumin. Near complete inhibition of cellular tyrosine kinase was also seen. \n\n\n\n  The inhibitory effects of curcumin on PhK is shown in Figure 10A. The effects of curcumin were seen at a dose of curcumin as low as 5 uM and the inhibitory effect plateued at about 3 mM. A similar effect was seen when the reaction product of PhK, i.e., phosphorylase b was analyzed by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Figure 10B shows that the inhibitory effects of curcumin were seen at 5 uM and no phosphorylated product was observed at 1.36 uM. \n\n\n\n   In order to examine the inhibitory constant of curcumin, the effect of the inhibitor on PhK at different concentrations of the substrate was examined. These results were then analyzed by Lineweaver-Burke plot analysis. Figure 11A illustrates that the curves for the inhibition of curcumin at different substrate concentrations were linear. Thus, curcumin is a non-competitive inhibitor and binds to the enzyme at a site different from the phosphorylase. Further, a plot of different curcumin concentrations against the slope indicated a Ki of 0.75 mM (Figure 11B). \n\n\n\n   Natural structural analogues of curcumin also inhibit PhK activity. Phosphorylase kinase (134 units/ml) was assayed with curcumin and its analogues as described \n\n &lt;Desc/Clms Page number 26&gt; \n\n above. As shown in Table XI, these analogues were inhibitory to curcumin but none inhibited the enzyme to the same extent as curcumin. \n\n\n\n   TABLE XI Inhibitory Effects of Curcumin and Curcumin   Analoques   of Phosphorylase Kinase   (PhK)   Activity \n EMI26.1 \n \n&lt;tb&gt; \n&lt;tb&gt; Compounds &lt;SEP&gt; PhK &lt;SEP&gt; inhibition &lt;SEP&gt; (% &lt;SEP&gt; of &lt;SEP&gt; control)\n&lt;tb&gt; curcumin &lt;SEP&gt; 67\n&lt;tb&gt; aromatic &lt;SEP&gt; ketone &lt;SEP&gt; (cmpd &lt;SEP&gt; 7) &lt;SEP&gt; 24\n&lt;tb&gt; ferulic &lt;SEP&gt; acid &lt;SEP&gt; 15\n&lt;tb&gt; cinnamic &lt;SEP&gt; acid &lt;SEP&gt; 15\n&lt;tb&gt; aromatic &lt;SEP&gt; ketone &lt;SEP&gt; (cmpd &lt;SEP&gt; 4) &lt;SEP&gt; 14\n&lt;tb&gt; \n \nAll patents and publications mentioned in this specification are indicative of the levels of those skilled in the art to which the invention pertains.
