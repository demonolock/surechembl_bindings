    " disclosure includes all isoforms of PCSK9 and their corresponding residue positions in isoforms or other mutant sequences. In some embodiments, isoforms of PCSK9 can have about 90%, about 91%, about 92%, about 93%, about 94%, about 95%, about 96%, about 97%, about 98%, about 99%, about 99.2%, about 99.4%, about 99.6%, about 98.8%, or about 99.9% sequence homology with human PCSK9 having the sequence given in the Biological Assays section below. Isoform sequences (SEQID Nos 1-6) are given after the Biological Assays section. </p> Because the disclosed compounds acts as both an H-bond acceptor A at a pyrimidinyl nitrogen and a donor B at the 2-NH- of its 2-amino pyrimidinyl group with Val589, a bonding triad in the binding site is formed out of two PCSK9 residues. The other pyrimidinyl nitrogen binds as an H-bond acceptor C to Ser636. The bond distance between each triad atom of the pharmacophore as disclosed herein is about 2.3 A to about 2.5 A as shown in FIG. 3. For example, acceptor A is 2.3-2.4 A from donor B and 2.3- 2.5 A from acceptor C. Donor B is 2.3-2.5 A from acceptor C. </p> As shown below, the three nitrogen atoms of the 2-aminopyrimidinyl core of the disclosed compounds interact with the triad. Analogs lacking one of these bonding features do not exhibit detectable binding to human PCSK9. </p><img id=\"imgf000029_0001\" path=\"imgf000029_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/759649497/WO/20200723/A1/002020/15/04/74/imgf000029_0001.tif\"/></p> KD = 54 mM no detectable no detectable no detectable </p> binding binding binding </p>As shown in FIG. 4, this H-bond triad is evident in fully elaborated compounds of the invention, such as compound 162. </p> Disclosed herein are methods of inhibiting PCSK9, comprising contacting PCSK9 with an inhibitor of PCSK9 that binds to a binding pocket defined by amino acid residues \n\n Val589 and Ser636 of human PCSK9. In some embodiments, the inhibitor is of PCSK9 is an allosteric inhibitor. In some embodiments, the method comprises contacting the surface of a cell that secretes PCSK9 with an inhibitor of PCSK9 that binds to a binding pocket defined by amino acid residues Val589 and Ser636 of human PCSK9. In certain embodiments, the method comprises binding PCSK9 that is intracellular with an inhibitor of PCSK9 that binds to a binding pocket defined by amino acid residues Val589 and Ser636 of human PCSK9. In some embodiments, the method comprises contacting a cell that expresses PCSK9 with an inhibitor of PCSK9 that binds to a binding pocket defined by amino acid residues Val589 and Ser636 of human PCSK9. In other embodiments, the method comprises binding PCSK9 that is in plasma, with an inhibitor of PCSK9 that binds to a binding pocket defined by amino acid residues Val589 and Ser636 of human PCSK9. </p> In some embodiments, the inhibitor comprises an H-bond acceptor/donor group having two H-bond acceptor moieties and one H-bond donor moiety disposed to donate an H-bond to and accep",
    "r CMD500d sensor chip (XanTec Bioanalytics) using standard amine coupling chemistry at 25\u00b0C with HBS-N (10 mM HEPES, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.4) as the running buffer. Briefly, the carboxymethyl dextran surface was activated with a 12 min injection of a 1 : 1 ratio of 0.4 M l-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC)/0.1 M A'-hydroxy succinimide (NHS) at a flow rate of 10 pL/min. \n\n For capture of streptavidin, protein was diluted to 0.2 mg/mL in 10 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.5) and captured by injecting 100 pL onto the activated chip surface. Residual activated groups were blocked with a 7 min injection of 1 M ethanolamine (pH 8.5). Avi- tagged PCSK9 protein was captured on the streptavidin surface by injection of 150 pL of protein diluted to 16 pg/mL in HBS-N, 0.05% tween-20, 0.1 mM CaCh. Typical surface densities obtained were 8000-10000 RU. SPR binding data were obtained using an appropriate dilution series of each compound at a flow rate of 30 pL/ min, with a capture time of 100 s and dissociation times of 300 s. Running buffer for compound binding studies was HBS-N, 0.05% tween-20, 0.1 mM CaCh, 4% DMSO. Data were corrected for DMSO excluded volume effects. All data were double-referenced for blank injections and reference surface using standard processing procedures and data processing and kinetic fitting were performed using Scrubber software, version 2.0c (BioLogic Software). Data were fitted using a simple 1 : 1 binding model to determine k<sub>a</sub>, kd and KD values. </p> The ability of compounds Formula (I) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof to bind and inhibit PCSK9 was established with the representative compounds of Formula (I) listed in the table below: </p><img id=\"imgf000247_0001\" path=\"imgf000247_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/759649484/WO/20200723/A1/002020/15/04/74/imgf000247_0001.tif\"/><img id=\"imgf000247_0002\" path=\"imgf000247_0002.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/759649453/WO/20200723/A1/002020/15/04/74/imgf000247_0002.tif\"/><img id=\"imgf000248_0001\" path=\"imgf000248_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/759649529/WO/20200723/A1/002020/15/04/74/imgf000248_0001.tif\"/><img id=\"imgf000249_0001\" path=\"imgf000249_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/759649584/WO/20200723/A1/002020/15/04/74/imgf000249_0001.tif\"/><img id=\"imgf000250_0001\" path=\"imgf000250_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/759649491/WO/20200723/A1/002020/15/04/74/imgf000250_0001.tif\"/><img id=\"imgf000251_0001\" path=\"imgf000251_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/759649522/WO/20200723/A1/002020/15/04/74/imgf000251_0001.tif\"/><img id=\"imgf000252_0001\" path=\"imgf000252_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/759649474/WO/20200723/A1/002020/15/04/74/imgf000252_0001.tif\"/><img id=\"imgf000253_0001\" path=\"imgf000253_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/7596494"
