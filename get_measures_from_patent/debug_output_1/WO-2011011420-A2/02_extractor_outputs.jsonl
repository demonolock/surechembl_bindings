{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nThe increase in CYP isoform IC50 for isotopically-enriched stiripentol analogs (Example 2 and Example 6) in comparison with non-isotopically enriched stiripentol are shown in Table 8. \n\n\nNote that there is only one sentence that meets the criteria, as the rest of the text does not provide specific numeric values with units for bioactivity metrics. The sentence mentions the molecule \"stiripentol analogs\", the bioactivity metric \"IC50\", but does not provide a specific numeric value with a unit. However, it references Table 8, which is likely to contain the relevant data. Unfortunately, the table is not provided in the text snippet."}
