    "ck concentration of 100 ng/mL in water/acetonitrile (90:10, v/v); final assay substrate concentrations were 20 \u03bcM for phenacetin, 4 \u03bcM for midazolam, 5 \u03bcM for dextromethorphan, 5 \u03bcM diclofenac, and 10 \u03bcM for S- mephenytoin. Test compounds and inhibitors were made up at a stock </p>concentration of 4000 \u03bcM in water/acetonitrile (50:50, v/v). The CYP enzyme inhibition curve, for the various CYP isozymes, was then determined by running the assay with various concentrations of test compound, while holding the substrate concentration constant. The concentrations of compound tested were: 100 \u03bcM, 50 \u03bcM, 10 \u03bcM, 5 \u03bcM, 1 \u03bcM, 0.5 \u03bcM, 0.1 \u03bcM, 0.05 \u03bcM, 0.01 \u03bcM, 0.005 \u03bcM, 0.002 \u03bcM, and O.OOl\u03bcM. The same concentrations were run with the inhibitors listed in Chart 1 as a positive control. The samples were incubated at 37 <sup>0</sup>C for 30 minutes. The samples were then diluted with ice cold acetonitrile (200 \u03bcL) to stop the reactions. Samples were centrifuged at 12,000 RPM for 10 minutes to precipitate proteins. Supernatants were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and stored for LC/MS/MS analysis to determine metabolite concentration. For CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 the compounds disclosed herein showed no inhibitory effect with respect to metabolite formation. The increase in CYP isoform IC<sub>50</sub> for isotopically-enriched stiripentol analogs (Example 2 and Example 6) in comparison with non-isotopically enriched stiripentol are shown in Table 8. \n\n Results of in vitro CYP Isoform IC50 Inhibition Assay </p><img id=\"imgf000043_0001\" path=\"imgf000043_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/168953228/WO/20110127/A2/002011/01/14/20/imgf000043_0001.tif\"/></p> Table 8 </p>In vitro Metabolism Using Human Cytochrome P<sub>450</sub> Enzymes </p>[00122] The cytochrome P<sub>450</sub> enzymes are expressed from the corresponding human cDNA using a baculovirus expression system (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). A 0.25 milliliter reaction mixture containing 0.8 milligrams per milliliter protein, 1.3 millimolar NADP<sup>+</sup>, 3.3 millimolar glucose-6-phosphate, 0.4 U/mL glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 3.3 millimolar magnesium chloride and 0.2 millimolar of a compound as disclosed herein, the corresponding non-isotopically enriched compound or standard or control in 100 millimolar potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) is incubated at 37 <sup>0</sup>C for 20 minutes. After incubation, the reaction is stopped by the addition of an appropriate solvent (e.g., acetonitrile, 20% trichloroacetic acid, 94% acetonitrile/6% glacial acetic acid, 70% perchloric acid, 94% acetonitrile/6% glacial acetic acid) and centrifuged (10,000 g) for 3 minutes. The supernatant is analyzed by HPLC/MS/MS. </p>Monoamine Oxidase A Inhibition and Oxidative Turnover </p> [00123] The procedure is carried out using the methods described by Weyler et al., Journal of Biological Chemistry 1985, 260, 13199-13207, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
