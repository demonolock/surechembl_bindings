    " variants, TACI receptor antibodies, BCMA receptor antibodies, TALL-1 antibodies, and APRIL antibodies . To determine whether a TALL-1 antagonist molecule partially or fully blocks, inhibits or neutralizes a biological activity of TALL-1 or APRIL, assays may be conducted to assess the effect (s) of the antagonist molecule on, for example, binding of TALL-1 or APRIL to TACI or to BCMA, or NF-KB activation by the respective ligand. Such assays may be conducted in known in vitro or in vivo assay formats, for instance, in cells expressing BCMA and/or TACI. Preferably, the TALL-1 antagonist employed in the methods described herein will be capable of blocking or neutralizing at least one type of TALL-1 activity, which may optionally be determined in assays such as described herein. To determine whether an APRIL antagonist molecule partially or fully blocks, inhibits or neutralizes a biological activity of TALL-1 or APRIL, assays may be conducted to assess the effect (s) of the antagonist molecule on, for example, binding of TALL-1 or APRIL to TACI or to BCMA, or NF-KB activation by the ligand. Such assays may be conducted in known in vitro or in vivo formats, for instance, using cells transfected with TACI or BCMA (or both TACI and BCMA) (preferably transfected' at relatively low levels) . Preferably, the APRIL antagonist employed in the methods described herein will be capable of blocking or neutralizing at least one type of APRIL activity, which may optionally be determined in a binding assay or an IgM-production assay. Optionally, a TALL-1 antagonist or APRIL antagonist will be capable of reducing or inhibiting binding of either TALL-1 or APRIL (or both TALL-1 and APRIL) to TACI or to BCMA by at least 50%, preferably, by at least 90%, more preferably by at least 99%, and most preferably, by 100%, as compared to a negative control molecule, in a binding assay. In one embodiment, the TALL-1 antagonist or APRIL antagonist will comprise antibodies which will competitively inhibit the binding of another ligand or antibody to TACI or BCMA. Methods for determining antibody specificity and affinity by \n\ncompetitive inhibition are known in the art [see, e.g., Hariow et al., Antibodies: Laboratory - Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY (1998); Colligan et al., Current Protocols in Immunology, Green Publishing Assoc, NY (1992; 1993); Muller, Meth. Enzym., 92:589-601 (1983).</p>The term \"TACI agonist\" or \"BCMA agonist\" refers to any molecule that partially or fully enhances, stimulates or activates a biological activity of TACI or BCMA, respectively, or both TACI and BCMA, and include, but are not limited to, anti-TACI receptor antibodies and anti-BCMA receptor antibodies . To determine whether a TACI agonist molecule partially or fully enhances, stimulates, or activates a biological activity of TACI or BCMA, assays may be conducted to assess the effect (s) of the agonist molecule on, for example, -PBLs or TACI or BCMA-transfected cells. Such assays may be conducted in known in vitro or in vivo assay formats. Preferably, the TACI agonist employed in the methods described herein will be capable of enhancing or activating at least one type of TACI activity, which may optionally be determined in assays such as<sub>.</sub> described herein. To determine whether a BCMA agonist molecule partially or ful",
    "culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival Of the unfused, immortalized cells. For example, if the parental cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT) , the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (\"HAT medium\") , which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells. Preferred immortalized cell lines are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high level expression of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. More preferred immortalized cell lines are murine myeloma lines, which can be obtained, for instance, from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, California and the</p>American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Virginia. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies [Kozbor, J. Immunol. , 133: 3001 (1984); Brodeur et al . , Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, (1987) pp. 51-63] .</p>The culture medium in which the hybridoma cells are cultured can then be assayed for the presence of monoclonal antibodies directed against TACI, BCMA, TALL-1 or APRIL. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by the hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked im unoabsorbent assay (ELISA) . Such techniques and assays are known in the art. The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson and Pollard, Anal . \n\nBiochem., 1_07:220 (1980). Optionally, the anti-TACI, anti-BCMA, anti-TALL-1, or anti-APRIL antibodies will have a binding affinity of at least lOnM, preferably, of at least 5nM, and more preferably, of at least InM for the respective receptor or ligand, as determined in a binding assay.</p>After the desired hybridoma cells are identified, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods [Goding, supra] . Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium and RPMI- 1640 medium. Alternatively, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites in a mammal.</p>The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones may be isolated or purified from the culture medium or ascites fluid by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography.</p>The monoclonal antibodies may also be made by recombinant DNA methods, such as those described in U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567. DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies) . The hybridoma cells of the invention serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. The DNA also ma",
    "l., Nature, 355: 258 (1992). Human antibodies can also be derived from phage-display libraries (Hoogenboom et al., J. Mol. Biol. , 227:381 (1991); Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222:581-597 (1991); Vaughan et al., Nature Biotech, 14:309 (1996)).</p>As described in the Examples below, particular anti-APRIL antibodies have been prepared. Four of these antibodies, 3C6.4.2, 5G8.2.2, 5E8.7.4, and 5E11.1.2, have been deposited with ATCC, and have been assigned accession numbers PTA-1347, PTA-1345, PTA-1344 and PTA-1346. In one embodiment, the anti-APRIL antibodies disclosed herein will have the same biological characteristics as the monoclonal antibodies secreted by the hybridoma cell lines deposited under accession numbers PTA-1347, PTA-1345, PTA-1344 or PTA-1346. The term \"biological characteristics\" is used to refer to the in vitro and/or in vivo activities or properties of the monoclonal antibody, such as the ability to bind to APRIL or to substantially block or reduce TACI or BCMA binding or activation by APRIL. Optionally, the anti-APRIL monoclonal antibody will have the same blocking activity as the 3C6.4.2 antibody, as determined by its ability to block binding of APRIL to TACI or BCMA. Optionally, the anti-APRIL monoclonal antibody will bind to the same epitope as the 5G8.2.2 antibody, the 5E8.7.4 antibody, the 3C6.4.2 antibody or the 5E11.1.2 antibody disclosed in the Examples below. Such epitope binding property can be determined for instance in a competitive \n\ninhibition binding assay, which techniques are known in the art. Such an anti-APRIL antibody will preferably competitively inhibit binding of either the 5G8.2.2 antibody, the 5E8.7.4 antibody, the 3C6.4.2 antibody or the 5E11.1.2 antibody to APRIL. It is contemplated that chimeric or humanized anti-APRIL antibodies can be constructed (such as by using the techniques described above) using or incorporating selected fragments or domain sequences from any of the afore-mentioned deposited anti-APRIL antibodies.</p>B. ASSAY METHODS</p>Ligand/receptor binding studies may be carried out in any known assay method, such as competitive binding assays, direct and indirect sandwich assays, and immunoprecipitation assays. Cell-based assays and animal models can be used to further understand the interaction between the ligands and receptors identified herein and the development and pathogenesis of the conditions and diseases referred to herein.</p>In one approach, mammalian cells may be transfected with the ligands or receptors described herein, and the ability of the agonists or antagonists to stimulate or inhibit binding or activity is analyzed. Suitable cells can be transfected with the desired gene, and monitored for activity. Such transfected cell lines can then be used to test the ability of antagonist (s) or agonist (s) to inhibit or stimulate, for example, to modulate B-cell proliferation or Ig secretion. Cells transfected with the coding sequence of the genes identified herein can further be",
    " plates were washed three times with wash buffer, followed by addition of 50 \u03bcl of substrate (TMB microwell peroxidase substrate, Kirkegaard &amp; Perry, Gaithersburg, MD) to each well and incubation at room temperature for 10 minutes. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 \u03bcl of TMB 1-component stop solution (diethyl glycol, Kirkegaard &amp; Perry) to each well, and absorbance at 490 nm was read in an automated microtiter plate reader.</p>The supernatants testing positive in the ELISA were then cloned twice by limiting dilution. \n\n As shown in Figure 14A, the 3C6.4.2, 5E8.7.4, 5E11.1.2 and 5G8.2.2 antibodies were found to bind Flag-APRIL.</p>EXAMPLE 7 Isotyping of anti-APRIL Antibodies</p>The isotypes of the anti-APRIL monoclonal antibodies (see Example 6) were determined by coating plates with isotype specific goat anti- mouse Ig (Fisher Biotech, Pittsburgh, PA) at 4\u00b0 C overnight. After non-specific binding sites were blocked with 2% BSA, 100 \u03bcl of hybridoma culture supernatants or .5 \u03bcg/ml of purified mAbs were added. After incubation for 30 minutes at room temperature, plates were incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig for 30 minutes at room temperature. The level of HRP bound to the plate was detected using HRP substrate as described above. As shown in the Table in Figure 14B, the anti-APRIL antibodies, 5E8.7.4, 5G8.2.2, and 3C6.4.2, were found to be isotype IgG2a antibodies. Anti-APRIL antibody 5E11.1.2 was found to be an isotype IgGl antibody.</p>EXAMPLE 8</p>Binding Assay Showing Blocking Activity of anti-APRIL mAbs</p>Microtiter plates (Nunc, Denmark) were coated with 50 \u03bcl/well goat anti-human Fc antibody (Boehringer Manheim) at 5 \u03bcg/ml in carbonate buffer overnight at 4\u00b0 C. The plates were then blocked with 150 \u03bcl/well of 2% BSA in PBS buffer for 1 hour at room temperature. The respective immunoadhesins, BCMA-IgG \u038c\u0393 TACI-IgG (prepared as described in Example 2 above) were added in a 50 \u03bcl/well volume at 5 \u03bcg/ml in block buffer and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. All antibodies (which were identified in the fusion described in Example 6) were diluted at 1:100 and 25 \u03bcl/well was added to the plate along with 25 \u03bcl/well of 2 \u03bcg/ml Flag-APRIL (see Example 2) and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The signal was developed with successive incubations with biotinylated anti-Flag antibody (Sigma Aldrich, Missouri) and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Life Science, New Jersey) .
