    "In an additional or alternative embodiment, the anti-NKG2A antibody binds the same epitope on NKG2A and/or competes for binding to CD94/NKG2A with the antibody having a heavy chain of any one of SEQ ID NOS: 2-6 and a light chain of SEQ ID NO: 7. The antibody can be, e.g., a human or humanized anti-NKG2A antibody.</p>In one embodiment, the anti-NKG2A antibody is a humanized antibody having the heavy chain CDRs of any one of the heavy chain sequences of SEQ ID NOS: 2-6 and the light chain CDRs of the light chain sequence of SEQ ID NO: 7. Exemplary complementarity-determining region (CDR) residues or sequences and/or sites for amino acid substitutions in framework region (FR) of such humanized antibodies having improved properties such as, e.g., lower immunogenicity, improved antigen-binding or other functional properties, and/or improved physicochemical properties such as, e.g., better stability, are provided.</p>In other embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions and kits are provided, as well as methods for using them.</p>These aspects are more fully described in, and additional aspects, features, and advantages will be apparent from, the description of the invention provided herein.</p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSFIG. 1 shows receptor occupancy in human blood of anti-NKG2A antibody (humZ270 also referred to as IPH2201) at different concentrations (ng/ml) listed on the x-axis and MESF signal for receptor binding is shown on the y-axis. The antibody had a binding affinity (EC50) of about 4 ng/mL for NKG2A+ cells (K<sub>D</sub>\u02dc4 ng/mL). This K<sub>D </sub>is consistent with K<sub>D </sub>values observed in other assays, notably affinity for binding to PBMC and affinity for recombinant NKG2A in Biacore assays. The K<sub>D </sub>for full receptor occupancy (the EC100) was about 100 ng/ml.</p>FIG. 2 shows predicted receptor occupancy of anti-NKG2A antibody based on human patients treated with a single dose of HumZ270 in a 92-patient Phase I trial. Substantially complete (at least 90%) receptor saturation of NKG2A+ cells can be achieved by administering 0.03 mg/kg every two weeks. Receptor saturation is greater with increasing doses, the plotted line in the figure having lowest receptor saturation corresponds to the lowest dose (0.01 mg/kg); each incremental higher dose level corresponds to the plotted line having the next higher receptor saturation, the line corresponding to the highest dose (10 mg/kg) has the highest receptor saturation. A dose of 0.1 mg/kg can be administered every four weeks to maintain substantially complete saturation of NKG2A.</p>FIG. 3A shows results from an autologous cellular assay, showing that the concentrations of anti-NKG2A required for efficacy (NKG2A blockade in the presence of cells expressing its HLA-E ligand) are 100-fold higher than concentrations providing full receptor saturation. The EC50 concentration (the amount that provides a 50% of maximum) in the CD107 mobilization assay was determined to be about 400 ng/ml, and the EC100 was about 10,000 ng/ml (10 \u03bcg/ml).</p>FIG. 3B shows the predicted IPH2201 (anti-NKG2A) blood concentration following two-weekly i.v. injections, based on preliminary PK data and NCA analysis from a IPH2201 phase I clinical trial. Different blood concentrations reached with different dosages administered by i.v. every two weeks. IPH2201 concentration is greater with increasing doses, the plotted line in the figure having lowest blood concentration corresponds to the lowest dose (0.01 mg/kg); each incremental higher dose level corresponds to the plotted line provides the next higher blood concentration, the line corresponding to the highest dose (10 mg/kg) provides the highest blood concentration. The dose of 4 mg/kg provided an initial (peak) blood concentration of about 100 \u03bcg/ml, i.e. at about the EC<sub>100 </sub>for efficacy in tissues, and a continued (minimum) blood concentration above 30 \u03bcg/ml up to the two week time point, or, as of the fourth dose a continued (minimum) blood concentration of approximately 100 \u03bcg/ml. The dose of 10 mg/kg provided a continued (minimum) blood concentration approximately 100 \u03bcg/ml.</p>FIG. 3C shows predicted IPH2201 blood concentration following two-weekly i.v. injections with a loading dose of 10 mg/kg body weight followed by a maintenance dose of 4 mg/kg body weight (shown as the upper line),",
    "asses: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM. Several of these are further divided into subclasses or isotypes, such as IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, and the like. An exemplary immunoglobulin (antibody) structural unit comprises a tetramer. Each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one \u201clight\u201d (about 25 kDa) and one \u201cheavy\u201d chain (about 50-70 kDa). The N-terminus of each chain defines a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids that is primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The terms variable light chain (V<sub>L</sub>) and variable heavy chain (V<sub>H</sub>) refer to these light and heavy chains respectively. The heavy-chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are termed \u201calpha,\u201d \u201cdelta,\u201d \u201cepsilon,\u201d \u201cgamma\u201d and \u201cmu,\u201d respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known. IgG are the exemplary classes of antibodies employed herein because they are the most common antibodies in the physiological situation and because they are most easily made in a laboratory setting. Optionally the antibody is a monoclonal antibody. Particular examples of antibodies are humanized, chimeric, human, or otherwise-human-suitable antibodies. \u201cAntibodies\u201d also includes any fragment or derivative of any of the herein described antibodies.</p>The term \u201cspecifically binds to\u201d means that an antibody can bind preferably in a competitive binding assay to the binding partner, e.g. NKG2A, as assessed using either recombinant forms of the proteins, epitopes therein, or native proteins present on the surface of isolated target cells. Competitive binding assays and other methods for determining specific binding are well known in the art. For example binding can be detected via radiolabels, physical methods such as mass spectrometry, or direct or indirect fluorescent labels detected using, e.g., cytofluorometric analysis (e.g. FACScan). Binding above the amount seen with a control, non-specific agent indicates that the agent binds to the target. An agent that specifically binds NKG2A may bind NKG2A alone or NKG2A as a dimer with CD94.</p>When an antibody is said to \u201ccompete with\u201d a particular monoclonal antibody, it means that the antibody competes with the monoclonal antibody in a binding assay using either recombinant molecules (e.g., NKG2A) or surface expressed molecules (e.g., NKG2A). For example, if a test antibody reduces the binding of an antibody having a heavy chain of any one of SEQ ID NOS: 2-6 and a light chain of SEQ ID NO: 7 to a NKG2A polypeptide or NKG2A-expressing cell in a binding assay, the antibody is said to \u201ccompete\u201d respectively with such antibody.</p>The term \u201caffinity\u201d, as used herein, means the strength of the binding of an antibody to an epitope. The affinity of an antibody is given by the dissociation constant Kd, defined as [Ab]\u00d7[Ag]/[Ab-Ag], where [Ab-Ag] is the molar concentration of the antibody-antigen complex, [Ab] is the molar concentration of the unbound antibody and [Ag] is the molar concentration of the unbound antigen. The affinity constant K<sub>a </sub>is defined by 1/Kd. Methods for determining the affinity of mAbs can be found in Harlow, et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1988), Coligan et al., eds., Current Protocols in Immunology, Greene Publishing Assoc. and Wiley Interscience, N.Y., (1992, 1993), and Muller, Meth. Enzymol. 92:589-601 (1983), which references are entirely incorporated herein by reference. One standard method well known in the art for determining the affinity of mAbs is the use of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) screening (such as by analysis with a BIAcore\u2122 SPR analytical device).</p>Within the context herein a \u201cdeterminant\u201d designates a site of interaction or binding on a polypeptide.</p>The term \u201cepitope\u201d refers to an antigenic determinant, and is the area or region on an antigen to which an antibody binds. A protein epitope may comprise amino acid residues directly involved in the binding as well as amino acid residues which are effectively blocked by the specific antigen binding antibody or peptide, i.e., amino acid residues within the \u201cfoot-print\u201d of the antibody. It is the simplest form or smallest structural area on a complex antigen molecule that can combine with e.g., an antibody or a receptor. Epitopes can be linear or conformational/structural. The term \u201clinear epitope\u201d is defined as an epitope composed of amino acid residues that are contiguous on the linear sequence of amino acids (primary structure). The term \u201cconformational or structur",
    "onstant region. In one embodiment, the IgG4 antibody comprises a modification to prevent the formation of half antibodies (fab arm exchange) in vivo, e.g., the antibody comprises an IgG4 heavy chain comprising a serine to proline mutation in residue 241, corresponding to position 228 according to the EU-index (Kabat et al., \u201cSequences of proteins of immunological interest\u201d, 5<sup>th </sup>ed., NIH, Bethesda, ML, 1991). Such modified IgG4 antibodies will remain intact in vivo and maintain a bivalent (high affinity) binding to NKG2A, as opposed to native IgG4 that will undergo fab arm exchange in vivo such that they bind to NKG2A in monovalent manner which can alter binding affinity. Alternatively, antibody fragments that do not comprise one or more constant regions, such as Fab or F(ab\u2032)2 fragments, can be used to avoid Fc receptor binding. Fc receptor binding can be assessed according to methods known in the art, including for example testing binding of an antibody to Fc receptor protein in a BIACORE assay. Also, any human antibody type (e.g. IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4) can be used in which the Fc portion is modified to minimize or eliminate binding to Fc receptors (see, e.g., WO03101485, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference). Assays such as, e.g., cell based assays, to assess Fc receptor binding are well known in the art, and are described in, e.g., WO03101485.</p>An anti-NKG2A antibody can advantageously bind to an extracellular portion of NKG2A with a KD that is at least 100 fold lower than the KD for binding to NKG2C. In a one aspect, the antibody binds to an extracellular portion of NKG2A with a KD that is at least 150, 200, 300, 400, or 10,000 fold lower than the KD for binding to NKG2C. In another aspect, the antibody binds to an extracellular portion of NKG2A with a KD that is at least 100 fold lower than the KD for binding to NKG2C, NKG2E and/or NKG2H molecules. In a further aspect, the antibody binds to an extracellular portion of NKG2A with a KD that is at least 150, 200, 300, 400, or 10,000 fold lower than the KD for binding to NKG2C, NKG2C and/or NKG2H molecules. This can be measured, for instance, in BiaCore experiments, in which the capacity of agents to bind the extracellular portion of immobilized CD94/NKG2A (e.g. purified from CD94/NKG2 expressing cells, or produced in a bio-system) is measured and compared to the binding of agents to similarly produced CD94/NKG2C and/or other CD94/NKG2 variants in the same assay. Alternatively, the binding of antibodies to cells that either naturally express, or over-express (e.g. after transient or stable transfection), CD94/NKG2A can be measured and compared to binding of cells expressing CD94/NKG2C and/or other CD94/NKG2 variants. Anti-NKG2A antibodies may optionally bind NKG2B, which is an NKG2A splice variant forming an inhibitory receptor together with CD94. In one embodiment, affinity can be measured using the methods disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 8,206,709, for example by assessing binding to covalently immobilized NKG2A-CD94-Fc fusion protein by Biacore as shown in Example 8 of U.S. Pat. No. 8,206,709, the disclosure of which is incorporate herein by reference.</p>The antibody can for example have an EC<sub>50 </sub>for binding (high affinity) to NKG2A-expressing cells of between 0.5-10 ng/ml, optionally 1-5 ng/ml, optionally 1-10 ng/ml, optionally 1-20 ng/ml, e.g. about 4 ng/ml. The NKG2A-expressing cells can be, for example, NKG2A-expressing cells in human PBMC. In one embodiment, the NKG2A-expressing cells are cells made to express ",
    " of lymphoid lineage, including leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, B-cell lymphoma, T-cell lymphoma, Hodgkins lymphoma, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, hairy cell lymphoma and Burketts lymphoma, and multiple myeloma; hematopoietic tumors of myeloid lineage, including acute and chronic myelogenous leukemias, promyelocytic leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome; tumors of mesenchymal origin, including fibrosarcoma and rhabdomyoscarcoma; other tumors, including melanoma, seminoma, terato-carcinoma, neuroblastoma and glioma; tumors of the central and peripheral nervous system, including astrocytoma, neuroblastoma, glioma, and schwannomas; tumors of mesenchymal origin, including fibrosarcoma, rhabdomyoscaroma, and osteosarcoma; and other tumors, including melanoma, xeroderma pigmentosum, keratoacanthoma, seminoma, thyroid follicular cancer and teratocarcinoma.</p>Examples of hematopoietic tumors of lymphoid lineage, include for example T-cell and B-cell tumors, including but not limited to T-cell disorders such as T-prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL), including of the small cell and cerebriform cell type; large granular lymphocyte leukemia (LGL) preferably of the T-cell type; Sezary syndrome (SS); adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma (ATLL); T-NHL hepatosplenic lymphoma; peripheral/post-thymic T cell lymphoma (pleomorphic and immunoblastic subtypes); angio immunoblastic T-cell lymphoma; angiocentric (nasal) T-cell lymphoma; anaplastic (Ki 1+) large cell lymphoma; intestinal T-cell lymphoma; T-lymphoblastic; lym-phoma/leukaemia (T-Lbly/T-ALL), multiple myeloma.</p>In one embodiment, the cancer is a head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In one embodiment the HNSCC is an oropharangeal tumor, a larynx tumor, a tumor of the oral cavity, or a tumor of the hypopharynx. In one embodiment, the HNSCC is an oral cavity SCC (OCSCC). OCSCC comprises squamous cell carcinoma of the lip, anterior \u2154 of the tongue, floor of the mouth, buccal mucosa, gingiva, hard palate and retromolar trigone. In one embodiment the HNSCC is a metastatic cancer.</p>When treating an individual having a solid tumor, a compound (e.g. antibody) that neutralizes the inhibitory activity of a human NKG2A polypeptide can advantageously be administered according to a treatment regimen described herein, to an individual having a cancer who has not received surgery to remove cancer cells, or who has not in the current period received such surgery. However it will be appreciated that the compound can also be administered to a patient who has received, or who is undergoing, surgery to remove cancer cells. Where the anti-NKG2A compound is administered to an individual who has not received surgical intervention to remove cancer cells (e.g. to remove HNSCC cells), the NKG2A-binding compound can for example be administered approximately 1 to 8 weeks prior to surgery. In one embodiment, at least one (e.g. one, two, three or more) complete administrati",

A titration was also performed with PE-coupled humZ270 and compared to titration done with bound humZ270 in order to examine the effect of the coupling to PE on the pharmacological properties of humZ270 and for evaluating the total number of receptors for a saturating concentration of humZ270.</p>Analysis focused on NKG2A+ cell subsets, i.e. NK cells and T cells. These subsets of lymphocytes do not all express NKG2A and therefore a NKG2A\u2212 subset for each population of interest were studied and compared to the NKG2A+ subset. The cell populations are defined as follows:\nLymphocytes: defined on a CD45/SSC plot, according to their granularity and size and CD45 expressionHuman NK lymphocytes: CD3-CD56+ cells among lymphocytesCD8 T cells: CD3+ CD8+ cells among lymphocytesNKG2A+ lymphocytes: NKG2A+ cells among lymphocytes.\n</p>The total Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) was recorded for each population. Calibrating beads was used to express Fluorescence in PE channel as MESF. The main populations of interest in this study are NKG2A+ lymphocytes mainly including NK cell.</p>Results showed that human anti-NKG2A mAb (humZ270) binds to two subsets of peripheral blood lymphocytes: NK and CD8+ T cells.</p>Results are summarized in FIG. 1. HumZ270, also referred to as IPH2201, is shown at different concentrations (ng/ml) listed on the x-axis and MESF signal for receptor binding is shown on the y-axis. The antibody had a binding affinity (EC50) of about 4 ng/mL for NKG2A+ cells (K<sub>D</sub>\u02dc4 ng/mL). This K<sub>D </sub>is consistent with K<sub>D </sub>values observed in other assays, notably affinity for binding to PBMC and affinity for recombinant NKG2A in Biacore assays. The K<sub>D </sub>for full receptor occupancy (the EC100) was about 100 ng/ml.</p>Example 5Receptor Saturation of IPH2201 in a Human Phase I Clinical Trial in Rheumatoid ArthritisHumZ270, a human IgG4 antibody was produced with a heavy chain having a serine to proline mutation in residue 241 of the heavy chain (S241P mutation), corresponding to position 228 according to the EU-index, in order to maintain high affinity bivalent binding in vivo. The safety profile of humZ270 (IPH2201) was explored in a double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-escalation phase I trial in 92 patients with stable and controlled rheumatoid arthritis. In this three-armed phase I trial, Z270 or placebo was administered as single-dose i.v. up to 10 mg/kg, or single-dose s.c. or multiple-dose s.c. (four administrations given with 2-week intervals) up to 4 mg/kg. The dosages tested as single dose by i.v. were: 0.0002, 0.001 mg/kg, 0.005 mg/kg, 0.025 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg, 0.4 mg/kg, 1.1 mg/kg, 3.5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg. All patients were followed for a minimum of 12 weeks. The safety profile was very favorable. The MTD was not reached. There were no SUSAR, no drug-related serious adverse events, no infusion related reaction and no immune related adverse event. Nasopharyngitis a",
    " plasma concentration needed for saturation as well as the clearance and volume of distribution of IPH2201.</p>Preliminary PK data and NCA analysis for IPH2201 phase I clinical trial, i.v. injection, enabled us to estimate the PK parameters for the PK model. Nominal times were used. A standard 2-compartment model was selected, with 1<sup>st </sup>order elimination and a non Linear Target Mediated Drug Disposition modelled by Michaelis Menten kinetic. A dose-dependent clearance was observed in NCA analysis and applied to this model, with clearance decreasing with increasing doses under 0.4 mg/kg, then remaining constant for higher doses. This preliminary PK model is consistent with known PK characteristics for IgGs for which dose dependency reflects target receptor (at low doses) and FcRn receptor (high doses) saturations (Brambell).</p>A population PD modelling was performed based on preliminary NKG2A occupancy data available from the ongoing phase I clinical trial.</p>A sigmoid Emax model was used to fit the plasma concentration-effect relationship. The model was characterized by an EC<sub>50</sub>, defined as the serum drug concentration to reach 50% of E<sub>max</sub>, i.e. 50% of NKG2A occupancy here.</p>However, when PD data were plotted against PK data, it was observed that as time after dosing increased, maximum NKG2A occupancy (Emax) obtained for the highest IPH2201 concentrations decreased in a time dependant linear manner, with no impact of the dose. Similarly, the EC50 seemed to linearly increase with time. In order to model this observation in NKGA2 occupancy profile, a decrease in Emax and an increase in EC50 with time were included to describe the NKG2A occupancy data.\n\n% NKG2A occupancy=(E<sub>max\u2212</sub>(E<sub>max</sub>Fall\u00d7TSLD))\u00d7C<sup>\u03b3</sup>/((EC<sub>50</sub>+EC<sub>50</sub>inc\u00d7TSLD)<sup>\u03b3</sup>+C<sup>\u03b3</sup>)\n</p>Where TSLD=Time Since Last Dose; E<sub>max</sub>=100%; E<sub>max</sub>F<sub>all</sub>=Rate of Decrease in Emax with time; EC<sub>50</sub>inc=Rate of Increase in EC<sub>50 </sub></p>Results of modelling are shown in FIG. 2, substantially complete (at least 90%) receptor saturation of NKG2A+ cells can be achieved by administering 0.03 mg/kg every two weeks. A dose of 0.1 mg/kg can be administered every four weeks to maintain substantially complete saturation of NKG2A. If saturation in the extravascular tissue (e.g. a solid tumor) is desired, an approximately 10-fold higher dose is believed to be needed, translating to a dose of about 0.4 mg/kg every two weeks, 1 mg/kg every four weeks.</p>The results for saturation of NKG2A receptors from this human clinical trial was consistent with the in concentration of anti-NKG2A required for full receptor occupancy (the EC100) determined in vitro (see Example 4).</p>Example 6CD107 Response to NKG2A Blockade Using IPH2201Autologous in vitro experiments using effector and target cells were performed in order to assess the killing mediated by cytokine-activated purified NK cells (effector cells) in 12 human individuals.

In particular, the expression by tumor cells of these stress-related antigens which are the natural ligands of NKG2D is decreased by clinical EGFR inhibitors, thus potentially decreasing the tumor cells' visibility to NK and T cells (Vantourout et al., Sci. Transl. Med. 6: 231ra49 (2014).</p>This experiment was designed to explore the effect of an EGFR inhibiting antibody on the ability of anti-NKG2A antibodies to activate NK cells in HNSCC. Effect of a dose-response of cetuximab on NK cells activation was determined by analysis of CD107 and CD137 expression, using as effector cells PBMC freshly isolated from healthy volunteers, and as target cells HNSCC cell lines (FaDu, and H-N), at an E:T ratio of 2.5/1. The read out was CD107 at 4 hours vs. CD137 at 24 hours, using 3 donors (CD107 read out in 4 h) and four donors (CD137 read out in 24 h). Cetuximab was tested at a dose response, 1/10 serial dilution starting at 10 \u03bcg/mL. For one healthy volunteer, NK cells were subdivided in NKG2A+ and NKG2A\u2212 subsets. Suboptimal doses of cetuximab were chosen for further testing to explore the effect of an EGFR inhibiting antibody on the ability of anti-NKG2A antibodies to activate NK cells in HNSCC. The 0.001 \u03bcg/mL (1 ng/mL) dose is the starting point of the cetuximab effect observed both with CD107 and CD137 readouts. The 0.01 \u03bcg/mL (10 ng/mL) dose is approximatively at the EC50 of the cetuximab effect.</p>The combined effect of anti-NKG2A and a sub-optimal dose of EGFR inhibitor was assessed by analysis of CD107 and CD137 expression, using as effector cells freshly isolated PBMC from healthy volunteers, and as target cells HNSCC cell lines (FaDu, H-N and CAL-27), clones of K562 cell line transfected with HLA-E (Clone E6=HLA-E<sup>+</sup>, clone F7=HLA-E<sup>\u2212</sup>), at an E:T ratio of 2.5/1. The read out was CD107 at 4 hours vs. CD137 at 24 hours, using 7 donors (FaDu and H-N)) and two donors (CAL-27).</p>Anti-NKG2A antibody whose heavy chain amino acid sequence is shown in SEQ ID NO: 3 and whose light chain amino acid sequence is shown in SEQ ID NO: 7 was used at a final concentration of 10 \u03bcg/mL corresponding to full functional activity, and EGFR inhibitor cetuximab was used at two suboptimal doses of 0.001 \u03bcg/mL or 0.01 \u03bcg/mL.</p>Full activity concentrations of Anti-NKG2A enhanced ADCC to HNSCC cell lines induced by suboptimal doses of cetuximab. No cetuximab-dependent ADCC was observed on K562 transfected cell lines as they do not express EGF-R. Anti-NKG2A effect is only seen on NKG2A positive NK cells, and is dependent on the level of expression of HLA-E. Indeed, anti-NKG2A effect is seen on cell lines with medium to high HLA-E level of expression (FaDu, CAL-27 and K562-HLA-E clone E6). FIG. 5 is a representative example, shown for FaDu cells. It can be seen in FIG. 5 that full activity doses of anti-NKG2A enhanced ADCC to HNSCC cell lines induced by suboptimal doses of cetuximab (ctx).</p>Example 11Combined Effect of Increasing Doses of Anti-NKG2A with Increasing Doses of CetuximabThe effect of the combination of increasing doses of EGFR inhibiting antibody an increasing doses of anti-NKG2A antibodies was evaluated for the ability to activate NK cells toward HNSCC target cells. Experiments sought to evaluate whether anti-NKG2A therapy can still enhance ADCC when cetuximab is used at a saturating dose, and whether the ant-NKG2A effect is dose-dependent.</p>Briefly, effector cells used were freshly isolated PBMC from healthy volunteers, and target cells were HNSCC cell lines (FaDu, H-N and CAL-27), and clones of K562 cell line transfected with HLA-E (Clone E6=HLA-E<sup>+</sup>, clone F7=HLA-E<sup>\u2212</sup>), and an E:T ratio of 2.5/1. The read out was CD107 at 4 hours vs. CD137 at 24 hours, using 2 donors. Anti-NKG2A antibody whose heavy chain amino acid sequence is shown in SEQ ID NO: 3 and whose light chain amino acid sequence is shown in SEQ ID NO: 7 was used at two suboptimal doses of 0.1 and 1 \u03bcg/mL, and at a saturating dose of 10 \u03bcg/mL. Cetuximab was used at two suboptimal doses of 0.001 \u03bcg/mL and 0.01 \u03bcg/mL (\u02dcEC50) and at a saturating dose of 0.1 \u03bcg/mL in these experimental settings.</p>Results are shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B. FIG. 6A shows CD107 read out on controls with no target and with K562-HLA-E transfectants. Each healthy volunteer is represented by a different symbol: squares or circles. Crossed open symbols correspond to condition where anti-NKG2A was replaced by 10 \u03bcg/mL hIgG4 isotypic control co-incubated with 0.1 \u03bcg/mL cetuximab. It can be seen that the effect of anti-NKG2A antibody is dose-dependent, depends on HLA-E expression level, and is still observed at a saturating dose of cetuximab of 0.1 \u03bcg/mL in the clone E6 that expresses HLA-E at high levels. In clone F7 (low HLA-E expression levels), the effect of anti-NKG2A was limited and high doses (e.g. full activity doses) of anti-NKG2A did not further augment the effect.</p>FIG. 6B shows CD107 read out on HNSCC cell lines.
