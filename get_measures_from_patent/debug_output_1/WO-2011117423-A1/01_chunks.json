The specificity of an antigen-binding protein can be determined based on affinity and/or avidity, as described on pages 53-56 of WO 08/020079 (incorporated herein by reference), which also describes some preferred techniques for measuring binding between an antigen-binding molecule (such as a polypeptide of the invention) and the pertinent antigen. Typically, antigen-binding proteins (such as the immunoglobulin single variable domains, and/or polypeptides of the invention) will bind to their antigen with a dissociation constant (KD) of 10<sup>\"5</sup> to 10<sup>\"</sup>\u00b0 moles/liter or less, and preferably 10<sup>\"7</sup> to 10<sup>\"</sup> moles/liter or less and more preferably 10<sup>\"</sup> to 10<sup>\"</sup> moles/liter (i.e. with an association constant (K<sub>A</sub>) of 10 to 10<sup>!2</sup> liter/ moles or more, and preferably 10<sup>7</sup> to 10<sup>12</sup> liter/moles or more and more preferably 10<sup>8</sup> to 10<sup>12</sup> liter/moles). Any KD value greater than 10<sup>4</sup> mol liter (or any <sub>A</sub> value lower than 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>~l</sup>) liters/mol is generally considered to indicate non-specific binding. Preferably, a monovalent immunoglobulin single variable domain of the invention will bind to the desired antigen with an affinity, less than 500 nM, preferably less than 200 nM, more preferably less than 10 nM, such as less than 500 pM. Specific binding of an antigen-binding protein to an antigen or \n\n antigenic determinant can be determined in any suitable manner known per se, including, for example, Scatchard analysis and/or competitive binding assays, such as radioimmunoassays (RIA), enzyme immunoassays (EIA) and sandwich competition assays, and the different variants thereof known per se in the art; as well as the other techniques mentioned herein. As will be clear to the skilled person, and as described on pages 53-56 of WO 08/020079, the dissociation constant may be the actual or apparent dissociation constant. Methods for determining the dissociation constant will be clear to the skilled person, and for example include the techniques mentioned on pages 53-56 of WO 08/020079. </p>p) The half-life of an amino acid sequence, compound or polypepti de of the invention can generally be defined as described in paragraph o) on page 57 of WO 08/020079 and as mentioned therein refers to the time taken for the serum concentrati on of the amino acid sequence, compound or polypeptide to be reduced by 50%, in vivo, for example due to degradation of the sequence or compound and/or clearance or sequestration of the sequence or compound by natural mechanisms. The in vivo half-life of an amino acid sequence, compound or polypeptide of the invention can be determined in any manner known per se, such as by pharmacokinetic analysis. Suitable techniques will be clear to the person skilled in the art, and may for example generally be as described in paragraph o) on page 57 of WO 08/020079. As also mentioned in paragraph o) on page 57 of WO 08/020079, the half-life can be expressed using parameters such as the tl/2- alpha, tl/2-beta and the area under the curve (AUC).

Expression was induced by IPTG and allowed to continue for 4h at 37\u00b0C. After spinning the cell cultures, periplasmic extracts were prepared by freeze-thawing the pellets. Nanobodies were purified from these extracts using immobilized metal affinity </p>chromatography (IMAC) and a buffer exchange to D-PBS. </p>Example 8. Binding FACS analysis of CXCR7 specific Nanobodies. </p>Serial dilutions of purified proteins (concentration range: 400 nM - 180 pM) were incubated with stable HEK-CXCR7 cells for 30 min at 4\u00b0C and binding was detected using anti-mouse anti-myc (Serotec) and anti-mouse IgG-PE (Jackson Immunoresearch). The half maximal effective concentration (EC50) values and upper plateau levels of selected clones are depicted in Table B-9. These data confirm the screening data and underscore that the indicated Nanobodies bind to cellular human CXCR7. </p>Table B-9: Binding FACS analysis \n\n</p><img id=\"imgf000109_0001\" path=\"imgf000109_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/169634304/WO/20110929/A1/002011/11/74/23/imgf000109_0001.tif\"/></p>Example 9 Nanobodies compete with SDF-1 for CXCR7 binding (displacement assay) </p> in order to assess the competition capacity, Nanobodies were evaluated in SDFl ligand displacement assays using stable NIH3T3-hCXCR7 cells. 24h after seeding the cells, the cells were pre-incubated for 1 h at 4\u00b0C with a dilution series of purified monovalent Nanobodies and the corresponding C-terminal Tag-2 tagged fusion proteins to the human serum albumin binding Nanobody Alb8 (see Table B-4: SFJQ ID NOs: 44 to 48 wherein the polypeptides are all C-terminal tagged with Tag-2). Also reference molecules Mab 8F1 1 (Biolegend), Mab 1 1G8 (R&amp;D) and unlabelled SDFl were included in the assay. </p>Radiolabeled [<sup>125</sup>I]-CXCL12 was diluted and added to the cells to reach a final concentration of 75 pM and cells were incubated for 3 h at 4\u00b0C. After incubation, cells were washed twice, lysed with RIPA buffer and the <sup>l25</sup>l signal was measured. Average Ki values and the percentage of displacement relative to the displacement of cold SDFl, are shown in Table B- 10. The competition of tested Nanobodies and 8F11 Mab is between 73 and 83%, relative to competition with unlabelled SDF 1. This level of displacement correspond to a 100% blocking of the CXCR7 protein, as the remaining SDF-1 binding is believed not to be CXCR7 mediated, but due to the SDF-1 interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Fusion to the human serum albumin-binding Nanobody Alb8 has no significant effect on Ki values. \n\n</p>able B-10: Displacement assay </p><img id=\"imgf000110_0001\" path=\"imgf000110_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/169634305/WO/20110929/A1/002011/11/74/23/imgf000110_0001.tif\"/></p>Example 10 Nanobodies compete with SDF-1 for CXC 7 binding (FACS assay) </p>The potency of Nanobody 7CXCR07C3 and Mab 8F1 1 (Biolegend) to compete with SDFl was evaluated in competition FACS with HEK-hCXCR7 cells. Cells were incubated simultaneously with 4 nM biotinylated SDFl (R&amp;D) and with diluted test molecules, for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. Binding of biotinylated SDFl was detected using streptavidin-PE. Competition curves are depicted in Figure 1. in this assay, Mab8Fl 1 and 07C3 competition is complete (&gt;95%), relative to competition with unlabelled SDFl, underscoring the complete inhibition of the SDF-1 -CXCR7 interaction. </p>Example 1 1 Nanobodies compete with 1 1G8 Mab for CXCR7 binding (FACS assay) </p> The minimal epitope of Mabl 1 G8 is known to be F<sub>14</sub>SDISWP<sub>20</sub> located at the CXCR7 N-terminus (see e.g. WO2008048519). Competition of Nanobodies, Mab 8F1 1 (Biolegend), Mab 1 1 G8 (R&amp;D) and Mab9C4 (MBL) with Mabl 1 G8-APC was tested in FACS analysis. Cells were incubated simultaneously with 20 nM Mabl 1 G8-APC (R&amp;D) and with diluted test \n\n no molecules for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. Competition curves are depicted in Figure 2. The level of competition with Mabl 1G8-APC ranges from ~20 to 100 % suggesting that the respective Nanobody epitopes"
