In some embodiments, the antigenic RSV G polypeptide comprises more than two RSV Gcc monomers. In some embodiments, the RSV G polypeptide does not comprise ferritin. In some embodiments, the RSV G polypeptide is single chain. In some embodiments, the RSV G polypeptides comprise a multimerization domain. In some embodiments, the RSV G polypeptides are particles/multimers, e.g., trimers, tetramers, or hexamers.</p><p id=\"p0075\">A.
