Measurement of Binding Affinities to CDKs</p>This protocol describes how the LanthaScreen Eu Kinase Binding Assay was performed to determine dissociation constants (K<sub>d</sub>) of compounds of general formula (I) and CDK/Cyclin complexes. The principle behind this assay is based upon the binding and displacement of an Alexa Fluor 647-labeled tracer, which binds to the active site of kinases. Binding of the tracer to the kinase is detected using a Eu-labeled antibody. Simultaneous binding of both the tracer and antibody to the kinase gives rise to a FRET-signal. Binding of an inhibitor to the kinase competes for binding with the tracer, resulting in a loss of FRET.</p>TABLE 2Reagents, stock concentrations and final assay concentrationsKinase-Tracer-conc.conc.AntibodyKinaseSupplier[nM]TracerSupplier[nM]AntibodySupplierconc.CDK2/Cyclin AProqinase5236Invitrogen20Eu-Anti-Cisbio1:750(135 kDa)GSTCDK7/CyclinH/Mat1Carna5236Invitrogen60Eu-Anti-Invitrogen2 nM(126 kDa)BiosciencesGSTCDK8/Cyclin CInvitrogen5236Invitrogen20Eu-Anti-Invitrogen2 nM(97 kDa)GSTCDK9/Cyclin T1Invitrogen5236Invitrogen30Eu-Anti-Cisbio1:250(132 kDa)GSTCDK9/Cyclin KInvitrogen10236Invitrogen35Eu-Anti-Invitrogen4 nM(92 kDa)GST</p>The compounds of general formula (I) summarized in Table 1 were diluted from a 10 mM DMSO stock solution 1:10 in a total volume of 15 \u03bcL DMSO. This compound predilution was then serial diluted 1:3 over 8 steps in DMSO and briefly spun down. Each compound solution was now diluted 1:33.33 in kinase buffer (HEPES: 20 mM, pH: 8.0; MgCl<sub>2</sub>: 10 mM; DTT: 1 mM; Brij-35: 0.01%), mixed thoroughly and spun down. For every sample, 5 \u03bcL of the diluted compound were mixed with 5 \u03bcL tracer working solution (e.g. 60 nM tracer 236 in kinase buffer for CDK2/Cyclin A) and 5 \u03bcL CDK/Cyclin/Anti-GST-AB-working solution (e.g. 15 nM CDK2/Cyclin A, 1:250 dilution of Anti-GST-AB in kinase buffer) in a well of a small volume 384 well plate (Corning Incorporated, Corning, N.Y., USA; order no. 3673). The tracer concentration was adjusted to its dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) for the CDK/Cyclin, which was 30 nM for CDK2/Cyclin A, CDK7/Cyclin H and CDK9/Cyclin T1, 20 nM for CDK8/Cyclin C, and 35 nM for CDK9 /Cyclin K. For negative controls, in each well 5 \u03bcL of DMSO working solution (3% DMSO diluted in kinase buffer) was mixed with 5 \u03bcL Anti-GST-AB working solution (e.g. 1:250 dilution of Anti-GST-AB in kinase buffer for CDK2/Cyclin A) and 5 \u03bcL Tracer working solution (e.g. 60 nM Tracer 236 in kinase buffer for CDK2/Cyclin A). For positive controls, in each well 5 \u03bcL of DMSO working solution (3% DMSO diluted in kinase buffer) was mixed with 5 \u03bcL CDK/Cyclin/Anti-GST-AB-working solution: (e.g. 15 nM CDK2/Cyclin A, 1:250 dilution of Anti-GST-AB in kinase buffer) and 5 \u03bcL Tracer working solution (e.g. 60 nM Tracer 236 in kinase buffer for CDK2/Cyclin A). Positive and negative controls were calculated from at least 8 different sample wells. The 384 well plates were mixed in a Teleshaker plate mixer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, Calif., USA) at 2000 rpm for 40 sec, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature before reading. The FRET signal was measured at 340 nm excitation, 665 nm and 615 nm emission (for the kinase tracer and LanthaScreen Eu-AB, respectively) with an Envision spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Mass., USA) with 50 \u03bcs delay and 300 \u03bcs integration time. K<sub>d </sub>values were determined from the sigmoidal dose response curves with the software Quattro Workflow (Quattro GmbH, Munich, Germany). Results are presented in Table 4.</p>2. Measurement of Half Maximal Inhibitory Concentration to CDKsThis protocol describes how the Lance Ultra KinaSelect Assay was performed to determine half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of compounds of general formula (I) and CDK/Cyclin complexes. The principle behind this enzymatic assay is based upon the phosphorylation of the ULight-Peptide Substrat. It is detected by using a specific EU-labeled anti-phospho peptide antibody. The binding of the Eu-labeled anti-phospho peptide antibody to the phosphorylated U Light labeled peptide gives rise to a FRET-signal. Binding of an inhibitor to the kinase prevents phosphorylation of the ULight-MBP Substrat, resulting in a loss of FRET.</p>TABLE 3Reagents, stock concentrations and final assay concentrationsKinase-ATP-Substrat-Antibody-conc.conc.conc.conc.KinaseSupplier[nM][\u03bcM]SubstratSupplier[nM]AntibodySupplier[nM]CDK1/CyclinB1Carna220UlightPerkin50Eu-anti-P-Perkin0.25(91 kDa)MBPElmerMBPElmerCDK2/CyclinAProqinase53UlightPerkin50Eu-anti-P-Perkin0.25(135 kDa)MBPElmerMBPElmerCDK4/CyclinD1Invitrogen1090UlightPerkin50Eu-anti-P-Perkin0.25(123 kDa)MBPElmerMBPElmerCDK6/CyclinD3Carna550UlightPerkin50Eu-anti-P-Perkin0.025(123 kDa)MBPElmerMBPElmerCDK7/CyclinH/MAT1Invitrogen1025UlightPerkin50Eu-anti-P-Perkin0.25(126 kDa)MBPElmerMBPElmerCDK9/CyclinT1Invitrogen1025UlightPerkin50Eu-anti-P-Perkin0.25(132 kDa)MBPElmerMBPElmerCDK9/CyclinKInvitrogen10125UlightPerkin50Eu-anti-P-Perkin0.25(92 kDa)MBPElmerMBPElmer</p>The compounds of general formula (I) summarized in Table 5 were diluted from a 10 mM DMSO stock solution 1:10 in a total volume of 15 \u03bcL DMSO.
