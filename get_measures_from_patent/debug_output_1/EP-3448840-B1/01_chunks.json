    "nvitrogen, Milan, Italy). The \u03b2-actin level was used as a protein loading control. For tissue analysis, obtained bands were normalized to the level of \u03b2-actin performed for each cerebral area tested. For cell cultures the bands were normalized to the \u03b2-actin level in each experimental condition.</p>Animals and treatment protocolsThis study was carried out in strict accordance with the European Council Directive 86/609/EEC and the Italian animal welfare legislation (art. 4 and 5 of D.L. 116/92). Seventy adult male 129/SV mice (22-24 g body mass, 8-10 weeks of age) were purchased from Harlan - Italy and were kept under environmentally controlled conditions (20 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C, 50-80 % humidity, 12 h light/dark cycle, food and water ad libitum).</p>Mice received either the selective COX-1 inhibitor mofezolac (6 mg/kg, i.p.; indicated as M in all the Figures) or vehicle (40% DMSO in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH = 7.4; VM in all the Figures) once a day for 10 days.</p>Mofezolac amount to be injected was chosen taken into account previous study and its COXs IC<sub>50</sub> values [14]. On the seventh day, mice were anesthetized with tribromoethanol (250 mg/Kg, i.p.) and positioned in a stereotactic apparatus (Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA). Vehicle (sterile saline, 5 \u00b5l; V-LPS in all the Figures) or 5 \u00b5g LPS in 5\u00b5L of sterile saline (LPS in all the Figures) was administered into the cerebral lateral ventricle using a fine needle glass syringe (Hamilton, Lyon, France) and a syringe pump (KD Scientific, Holliston, MA, USA) at a rate of 1\u00b5L/min. This LPS dose and time point (72 h) induced the best neuroinflammatory response following a titration preliminary study (data not shown). Sterotaxic injections coordinates were: 2.3 mm dorsal/ventral, 1.0 mm lateral, and 0.5 mm anterior/posterior from the bregma. Mofezolac was given 30 min prior to LPS injection (M + LPS in all the Figures).</p>Immunohistochemical stainingMice were transcardially perfused with tris-buffered saline (pH = 7.6) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS pH = 7.4 at 4 \u00b0C. Brains were subsequently post-fixed in the same fixative, paraffin embedded and 10 \u00b5m slices were obtained with a rotative microtome (Leica, Milan, Italy). Immunohistochemistry was performed following a standard avidin-biotin complex procedure. Briefly, specimens were incubated with mouse primary monoclonal antibody (mAb) anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) at a ratio of 1:1000 (Merck Millipore, Milan, Italy), or a mouse mAb anti-ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule-1 (Iba-1) at a ratio of 1 : 500 (Merck Millipore) overnight at 4\u00b0 C and then with an anti-mouse biotinylated secondary Ab (Dako, Milan, Italy), at a 1:1000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. The antigen-Ab complexes were visualized by sections incubation for 1 h with extravidin peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted 1: 1500 and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine oxidation in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p>PGE<sub>2</sub> assayMicroglial cells were cul"
