{"raw_mentions": "Mofezolac amount to be injected was chosen taken into account previous study and its COXs IC50 values [14]. \nMice received either the selective COX-1 inhibitor mofezolac (6 mg/kg, i.p.; indicated as M in all the Figures) or vehicle (40% DMSO in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH = 7.4; VM in all the Figures) once a day for 10 days.\nMice were anesthetized with tribromoethanol (250 mg/Kg, i.p.) and positioned in a stereotactic apparatus (Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA). \nVehicle (sterile saline, 5 \u00b5l; V-LPS in all the Figures) or 5 \u00b5g LPS in 5\u00b5L of sterile saline (LPS in all the Figures) was administered into the cerebral lateral ventricle using a fine needle glass syringe (Hamilton, Lyon, France) and a syringe pump (KD Scientific, Holliston, MA, USA) at a rate of 1\u00b5L/min. \nSpecimens were incubated with mouse primary monoclonal antibody (mAb) anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) at a ratio of 1:1000 (Merck Millipore, Milan, Italy), or a mouse mAb anti-ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule-1 (Iba-1) at a ratio of 1 : 500 (Merck Millipore) overnight at 4\u00b0 C and then with an anti-mouse biotinylated secondary Ab (Dako, Milan, Italy), at a 1:1000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. \nThe antigen-Ab complexes were visualized by sections incubation for 1 h with extravidin peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted 1: 1500 and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine oxidation in the presence of H2O2."}
