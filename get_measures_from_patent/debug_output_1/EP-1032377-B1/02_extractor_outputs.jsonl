{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nThe binding assays were conducted in 130 \u00b5M choline chloride at 37\u00b0C for 60-minute incubation with [<sup>3</sup>H] saxitoxin and [<sup>3</sup>H] batrachotoxin as radioligands for site 1 and site 2, respectively.\n\n\nNote that there is only one sentence that contains a specific molecule name (saxitoxin and batrachotoxin), a bioactivity metric is not explicitly mentioned, but the context suggests a binding assay, a specific numeric value for that metric (130 \u00b5M), and a unit for that value (\u00b5M). However, this sentence does not contain a bioactivity metric like IC50, Ki, etc. \n\nAfter re-reading the text, I found another sentence that meets the criteria:\n\n\nConcentration-inhibition curves were fitted with equation 1: I/Ic\u2062o\u2062n\u2062tr\u2062o\u2062l=1/1+c\u2062o\u2062m\u2062p\u2062o\u2062u\u2062nd/I\u2062C50\n\n\nThis sentence contains a bioactivity metric (IC50), but it does not contain a specific molecule name and a specific numeric value for that metric. \n\nUnfortunately, there are no sentences that meet all four criteria. If you would like, I can try to extract more information or provide more context."}
