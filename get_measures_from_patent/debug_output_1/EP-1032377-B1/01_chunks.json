    "gth). Compounds are dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to make a 10 mM stock solution, which was subsequently diluted into Tyrode's solution to give final concentrations of 0.1-20 \u00b5M. At the highest (1%) concentration. DMSO inhibited the size of Na<sup>+</sup> current only slightly. Currents were recorded at room temperature (22-25\u00b0C), filtered at 5 kHz with 4-pole Bessel filter, digitized at 20-50-\u00b5s intervals, and stored using Digidata 1200 analog/digital interface with Pclamp6/Clampex software (Axon Instruments). Residual series resistance ranged from 0.4 to 0.8 M\u03a9 after partial compensation (typically \u223c90%). The inhibitory potency of drugs was assessed by measuring reductions in the peak amplitude of Na<sup>+</sup> currents induced by increasing concentrations of compounds tested. Na<sup>+</sup> currents were elicited by stepping membrane voltage from holding potentials over the range -100 mV to -50 mV, to a pulse potential of -10 mV. The test pulse duration was 5-10 msec, repeated at a frequency \u2264 1 Hz. Concentration-inhibition curves were fitted with equation 1: I/Ic\u2062o\u2062n\u2062tr\u2062o\u2062l=1/1+c\u2062o\u2062m\u2062p\u2062o\u2062u\u2062nd/I\u2062C50<img id=\"ib0012\" path=\"imgb0012.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/143721240/EP/20101117/B1/000001/03/23/77/imgb0012.tif\"/>\nwhere I<sub>control</sub> is the maximal Na<sup>+</sup> current in the absence of antagonist, [compound] is the drug concentration, and IC<sub>50</sub> is the concentration of compound that produces half maximal inhibition.</p>Binding Assay:The ability of compounds of Formula II to modulate either site 1 or site 2 of the Na<sup>+</sup> channel was determined following the procedures fully described in Yasushi, J. Biol. Chem. 261:6149-6152 (1986) and Creveling, Mol. Pharmacol. 23:350-358 (1983), respectively. Rat forebrain membranes were used as sources of Na<sup>+</sup> channel proteins. The binding assays were conducted in 130 \u00b5M choline chloride at 37\u00b0C for 60-minute incubation with [<sup>3</sup>H] saxitoxin and [<sup>3</sup>H] batrachotoxin as radioligands for site 1 and site 2, respectively.</p>The compounds of Formula II may be tested for in vivo anticonvulsant activity after iv or ip injection using a number of anticonvulsant tests in mice (audiogenic seizure model in DBA-2 mice, pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures in mice, maximum electroshock seizure test (MES)).</p>The compounds may be tested for their neuroprotective activity after focal and global ischemia produced in rats or gerbils according to the procedures described in Buchan et al. (Stroke, uppI 148-152 (1993)) and Sheardown et al. (Eur. J. Pharmacol. 236:347-353 (1993)) and Graham et al. (J. Pharmacol. Exp. Therap. 276:1-4 (1996)).</p>The compounds may be tested for their neuroprotective activity after traumatic spinal cord injury according to the procedures described in Wrathall et. al. (Exp. Neurology 137:119-126 (1996)) and Iwasaki et. al. (J. Neuro Sci. 134:21-25 (1995)).</p>Compositions for use according to this invention incl",

Optionally, the suspension may also contain stabilizers.</p>The following examples are illustrative of the present invention.</p>Example 12-(4-(2-Fluorobenzyloxy)benzylamino)-2-methyl-propanamide as Na<sup>+</sup>channel blocker2-(4-(2-Fluorobenzyloxy)benzylamino)-2-methyl-propanamide was tested in the electrophysiological and binding assays described above and produced dose-dependent inhibition of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> currents recorded in acutely dissociated rat hippocampal neurons. The blocking effect of this compound on Na<sup>+</sup> currents was highly sensitive to the holding voltage. For example, at concentrations between 0.1 - 10 \u00b5M, 2-(4-(2-fluorobenzyloxy)benzylamino)-2-methyl-propanamide had very little effect on Na<sup>+</sup> currents activated from a holding membrane voltage of -100 mV, but inhibited currents with increasing potency as the holding potential was progressively depolarized. The most potent block in these studies was seen at a membrane holding voltage of -65 mV. The decrease in current was due to steady-state inactivation of the Na<sup>+</sup> channels.</p>This data indicates that 2-(4-(2-fluorobenzyloxy)benzylamino)-2-methyl-propanamide binds to voltage-sensitive Na<sup>+</sup> channels in their inactivated states and has weak potency towards Na<sup>+</sup> channels in their resting states (Ragsdale et al., Mol. Pharmacol. 40:10:756-765 (1991); Kuo and Bean, Mol. Pharmacol. 46:716-725 (1994)). The apparent antagonist dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) of this compound for inactivated Na<sup>+</sup> channels is \u223c1.2 \u00b5M.</p>Example 22-(4-(3,4-Methylenedioxyphenoxy)benzylamino)-2-methyl-propanamidea) 4-(3,4-Methylenedioxyphenoxy)benzaldehyde: A mixture of sesamol (5.13 g, 37.1 mmol), 4-fluorobenzaldehyde (4.0 mL, 37.3 mmol), potassium carbonate (6.21 g, 44.9 mmol) in N,N-dimethylacetamide (50 mL) was refluxed for 23 h. The mixture was added to water and extracted with an ethyl acetate/hexane solution. The organic layer was washed with aqueous sodium hydroxide (2 N), dried over sodium sulfate, and evaporated under reduced pressure to give crude product. The crude product was purified by flash chrmoatography to give a pink solid, which was decolorized by refluxing with activated charcoal in chloroform for 1 h. Filtration through Celite and removal of the chloroform in vacuo gave the desired aldehyde. <sup>1</sup>H NMR (CDCl<sub>3</sub>) \u03b4 9.91 (s, 1H), 7.83 (d, J = 9.0 Hz, 2H), 7.03 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, 2H), 6.82 (d, J = 8.7Hz, 1H), 6.62 (d, J = 2.4 Hz, 1H), 6.58-6.54 (m, 1H), 6.02 (s, 2H).b) 2-Amino-2,2-dimethylethanamide: A solution of HCl in dioxane (4.0 M), methanol (54 ml) and aminoisobutyric acid (11.7 g, 0.114 mol) was refluxed for 6 h. Once at rt, the solution was concentrated to a white solid. NMR of the solid showed that the solid was a mixture of aminoisobutyric acid and methyl 2-amino-2,2-dimethylacetate.
