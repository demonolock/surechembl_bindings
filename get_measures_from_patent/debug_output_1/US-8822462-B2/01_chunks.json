    "nding Studies for Secondary EffectsCompounds can be evaluated for binding to the human ether-a-go-go potassium channel (hERG) expressed in HEK293 cells by displacement of <sup>3</sup>[H]-astemizole according to the methods by Finlayson et al. (K. Finlayson, L. Turnbull, C. T. January, J. Sharkey, J. S. Kelly; [<sup>3</sup>H]Dofetilide binding to HERG transfected membranes: a potential high throughput preclinical screen. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2001, 430, 147-148). Compounds can be incubated at 1 or 10 \u03bcM final concentration, in duplicate, and the amount of displaced <sup>3</sup>[H]-astemizole determined by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. In some cases, a seven concentration (each concentration in duplicate) displacement curve can be generated to determine an IC<sub>50</sub>. Binding to the rat alpha-1 adrenergic receptor in rat brain membranes can be determined by displacement of <sup>3</sup>[H]-prazosin (P. Greengrass and R. Bremner; Binding characteristics of <sup>3</sup>H-prazosin to rat brain a-adrenergic receptors. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1979, 55: 323-326). Compounds can be incubated at 0.3 or 3 \u03bcM final concentration, in duplicate, and the amount of displaced <sup>3</sup>[H]-prazosin determined by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Binding IC<sub>50 </sub>values can be determined from displacement curves (four-six concentrations, each concentration in duplicate) fit by a non-linear, least squares, regression analysis using MathIQ (ID Business Solutions Ltd., UK). The binding Ki's can be determined from the IC<sub>50 </sub>according to the method of Cheng and Prusoff (Y. Cheng and W. H. Prusoff; Relationship between the inhibition constant (K1) and the concentration of inhibitor which causes 50 percent inhibition (IC<sub>50</sub>) of an enzymatic reaction. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973, 22: 3099-3108).</p>Example 3Metabolic StabilityCompounds can be incubated with pooled human (from at least 10 donors) or rat liver microsomes, 1.0 mg/ml microsomal protein, and 1 mM NADPH, in buffer at 37\u00b0 C. in a shaking water bath according to the method of Clarke and Jeffrey (S. E. Clarke and P. Jeffrey; Utility of metabolic stability screening: comparison of in vitro and in vivo clearance. Xenobiotica 2001. 31: 591-598). At 60 min the samples can be extracted and analyzed for the presence of the parent compound by LC-MS/MS. The parent material remaining in the sample at 60 min can be compared to that at 0 min and expressed as a percentage. A control compound, testosterone, can be run in parallel.</p>Rats (n=3 per dose) can be administered compounds at doses of 1-4 mg/kg in a single bolus i.v. infusion (2 ml/kg body weight) via the tail vein formulated in 2% dimethyl acetamide/98% 2-hydroxy-propyl cyclodextrin (5%). Animals can be fasted overnight prior to dose administration and food returned to the animals two hours after dosing. Following IV dosing, blood samples (ca 200 \u03bcL) can be collected into separate tubes containing anticoagulant (K-EDTA) via the orbital plexus at various times post administration. Plasma samples can be prepared immediately after collection by centrifugation for ten minutes using a tab"
