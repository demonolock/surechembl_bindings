    "on are each highly conserved regions in the HIV-1 envelope protein. The HR2 region has been generally described as comprising amino acid residues of SEQ ID NO:1, or polymorphisms thereof (see, e.g., FIG. 2). As further shown in FIG. 1, the HR regions have a plurality of 7 amino acid residue stretches or \u201cheptads\u201d (the 7 amino acids in each heptad designated \u201ca\u201d through \u201cg\u201d), with a predominance of hydrophobic residues at the first (\u201ca\u201d) and fourth (\u201cd\u201d) positions, and charged residues frequently at the fifth (\u201ce\u201d) and seventh (\u201cg\u201d) positions. Also present in the amino acid sequence of HIV gp41 are leucine zipper-like motifs comprising an 8 amino acid sequence initiating with, and ending with, either an isoleucine or leucine. As illustrated in FIG. 1, the HR2 region has just one leucine zipper like-motif, whereas the HR1 region has five leucine zipper-like motifs. The heptads and a leucine zipper-like motif are amino acid sequence features thought to contribute to formation of the coiled coil structure found for gp41.</p>It was discovered that peptides derived from the natural sequence of either the HR1 region (\u201cHR1 peptides\u201d) or HR2 region (\u201cHR2 peptides\u201d) of HIV gp41 inhibit transmission of HIV to host cells both in in vitro assays and in in vivo clinical studies. For example, HR2 peptides, as exemplified by DP178 (also known as T20, enfuvirtide, and Fuzeon\u00ae; SEQ ID NO:2), T651 (SEQ ID NO:3), T649 (SEQ ID NO:4), blocked infection of target cells with potencies of 0.5 ng/ml (EC50 against HIV-1<sub>LAI</sub>), 5 ng/ml (IC50; HIV-1 IIIB), and 2 ng/ml (IC50; HIV-1 IIIB), respectively. Efforts have been made to improve the biological activity of HIV gp4\u2032-derived peptides, such as by trying to stabilize the helical structure of the peptide. For example, synthetic peptides having helix stabilization are disclosed by the present inventors in PCT publication WO 2005/067960, and are exemplified as SEQ ID NOs:5-7 herein. Synthetic peptides which can inhibit HIV fusion (a process by which HIV gp41 mediates fusion between the viral membrane and the membrane of the cell during the infection process by HIV of a target cell) are a class of peptides often referred to as HIV fusion inhibitor peptides.</p>Another drawback associated with synthetic peptides relates to the solubility and stability in aqueous-based pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, such as relating to the process of making an injectable solution formulation of an HIV fusion inhibitor peptide. For example, it is difficult to achieve an injectable aqueous solution containing a synthetic peptide having an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 in a concentration of more than 100 mg/ml without encountering problems of solubility (wherein the formulation resembles a gel, rather than a solution, or peptide precipitates out of solution over a predetermined time period) and stability (peptide being degraded over a predetermined period of time), and without adding additional components to the formulation to promote stability and/or solubility. Also it would be desirable to develop an",
    " an in vitro assay which has been shown, by data generated using peptides derived from the HR regions of HIV gp41, to be predictive of antiviral activity observed in vivo. More particularly, antiviral activity observed using an in vitro infectivity assay (\u201cMagi-CCR5 infectivity assay\u201d; see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,258,782) has been shown to reasonably correlate to antiviral activity observed in vivo for the same HIV gp41 derived peptides (see, e.g., Kilby et al., 1998, Nature Med. 4:1302-1307). These assays score for reduction of infectious virus titer employing the indicator cell lines MAGI or the CCR5 expressing derivative cMAGI. Both cell lines exploit the ability of HIV-1 tat to transactivate the expression of a \u03b2-galactosidase reporter gene driven by the HIV-LTR. The \u03b2-gal reporter has been modified to localize in the nucleus and can be detected with the X-gal substrate as intense nuclear staining within a few days of infection. The number of stained nuclei can thus be interpreted as equal to the number of infectious virions in the challenge inoculum if there is only one round of infection prior to staining. Infected cells are enumerated using a CCD-imager and both primary and laboratory adapted isolates show a linear relationship between virus input and the number of infected cells visualized by the imager. In the MAGI and cMAGI assays, a 50% reduction in infectious titer (Vn/Vo=0.5) is significant, and provides the primary cutoff value for assessing antiviral activity (\u201cIC50\u201d is defined as the concentration of active ingredient resulting in a 50% reduction in infectious virus titer). Peptides tested for antiviral activity were diluted into various concentrations, and tested in duplicate or triplicate against an HIV inoculum adjusted to yield approximately 1500-2000 infected cells/well of a 48 well microtiter plate. The peptide (in the respective dilution) was added to the cMAGI or MAGI cells, followed by the virus inocula; and 24 hours later, an inhibitor of infection and cell-cell fusion (e.g., T20 (SEQ ID NO:2; enfuvirtide)) was added to prevent secondary rounds of HIV infection and cell-cell virus spread. The cells were cultured for 2 more days, and then fixed and stained with the X-gal substrate to detect HIV-infected cells. The number of infected cells for each control and peptide dilution was determined with the CCD-imager, and then the IC50 was calculated (expressed in \u03bcg/ml).</p>Viruses resistant to the antiviral activity of a peptide consisting of a base sequence can be produced using standard laboratory methods. Basically, after calculating the IC50 and IC90, cells were mixed with virus and the peptide (e.g., at a concentration close to the IC90) in culture (including when the cells are split thereafter). The cultures are maintained and monitored until syncytia are present. Virus harvested from this first round of culture is used to infect cells in a second round of culture, with the peptide present in a higher concentration (2 to 4 times) than that used in the first round of culture. The second round of culture is maintained and monitored for presence of virus resistant to the antiviral activity of the peptide. Subsequent rounds of culture may be needed to finally generate a viral isolate resistant to the antiviral activity of the peptide (at a pre-determined level of the IC50 of the peptide against such isolate).</p>For determining pharmacokinetic properties, an HIV fusion inhibitor peptide or a base sequence from which an HIV fusion inhibitor peptide is derived was dosed intravenously in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fasicularis) (other animal models may be used for determining pharmacokinetic properties, as known in the art). At various times post-dose, blood samples were drawn and plasma isolated by centrifugation. Plasma samples were stored frozen until analysis by LC-MS (liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry) in the electrospray, positive-ion mode. An HIV fusion inhibitor or base sequence was eluted from a C18 or C8 HPLC column with a gradient of acetonitrile in a buffer of 10 mM ammonium acetate, pH 6.8. At the time of analysis, plasma samples were deproteinated with either two or three volumes of acetonitrile containing 0.5% formic acid. Duplicate calibration standards in cynomolgus plasma samples were prepared at the same time as the samples and analyzed before and after the samples containing either HIV fusion inhibitor peptide or base sequence. Pharmacokinetic properties were calculated from the plasma concentration-time data using either mono-exponential or bi-exponential mathematical models. Models were derived by non-linear least squares optimization. A 1/C<sup>2 </sup>weighting of concentrations was used. The following equations were used to calculate area-under the plasma concentration vs. time curve (AUC), total body clearance "
