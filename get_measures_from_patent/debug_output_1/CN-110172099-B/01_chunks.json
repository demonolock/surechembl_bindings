The cell culture plate was placed at 37 \u2103 in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>After 3 days of incubator incubation, the cell culture plates were removed, centrifuged at 3000rpm for 10min and 80. mu.l of supernatant was removed per well for detection of human IL-2.</p>IL-2 ELISA detection was performed according to the kit (Shenzhen Xin Bosheng Biotech Co., Ltd.; cat: EHC 003.96) instructions, and the procedure was as follows:</p>a. diluting the taken cell culture supernatant by 25 times (different dilution times in different experiments), and adding the diluted cell culture supernatant into an enzyme label plate (100 ul/well); the standard substance is diluted into different concentration gradients by specimen universal diluent: 1000pg/ml, 500 pg/ml, 250 pg/ml, 125 pg/ml, 62.5 pg/ml, 31.25pg/ml, 15.625 pg/ml, 100. mu.l per well; and adding a standard general diluent into the blank hole.</p>b. The reaction wells were sealed with sealing plate gummed paper and incubated at 37 \u2103 for 90 minutes.</p>c. Washing the plate for 5 times, 3 minutes each time, adding 100 mul of biotin antibody working solution into each hole, adding biotinylated antibody diluent into a blank hole, sealing the reaction hole with new sealing plate adhesive paper, and incubating for 60 minutes at 37 \u2103.</p>d. Washing the plate for 5 times, 3 minutes each time, adding 100 mul of enzyme-bound working solution into each hole, adding enzyme-bound diluent into a blank hole, sealing the reaction hole with new plate-sealing adhesive paper, and incubating for 30 minutes at 37 \u2103 in a dark place.</p>e. The plate was washed 5 times for 3 minutes each, 100. mu.l of chromogenic substrate TMB was added to each well, and incubated at 37 \u2103 for 15 minutes in the absence of light.</p>f. Adding stop solution, 100 mul/hole, mixing, and reading OD450 with enzyme labeling instrument within 3 min.</p>g. And (4) analyzing results: IL-2 values were calculated and converted to percent (%) increase compared to blank control to assess human T cell activation activity of the samples.</p>The results in Table 11 show that the binding constant (Ka), dissociation constant (Kd), and affinity KD (0.52 nM) of the anti-human LAG-3 antibodies of the invention and the specific antigen human LAG-3 are within the appropriate range required for a suitable therapeutic antibody drug. In particular, the antibodies of the invention block binding of MHCII and human LAG-3 with IC50 ab835= 2.27nM vs Ref = 2.76nM (fig. 3 a), and their functional activity preventing binding of LAG-3 and MHCII to activate human T cell activity (release of IL 2) EC50 ab835=1.74ug/ml vs Ref =1.56 ug/ml (fig. 3b) is at least comparable to that of clinical molecules (control Ref).</p>Example 11: activity detection of the anti-LAG-3 antibody of the invention alone and in combination with the PD-1 antibody in Mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLRassay)</p>The activity of the series of antibodies of the present invention in activating human T cells was evaluated by a method of detecting IL-2 secretion using mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR assay). That is, Dendritic Cells (DCs) derived from PBMCs isolated from human blood cells of the present invention (isolated from peripheral blood from healthy volunteers) are stimulated with DCs from different subjectsT cells of the volunteers. Specifically, Dendritic Cell (DC) culture: on day 1 of the experiment, PBMCs were inoculated in 6-well plates, 2ml per well, 1 \u00d7 10 using RPMI1640 medium<sup>6</sup>After 2 hours of culture in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 \u2103 in ml, the suspension cells were gently aspirated, 2ml of medium and 100ng/ml GM-CSF (Peprotech, Cat #: 300-03) and 100ng/ml IL-4 (Peprotech, Cat #: 200-04) were added to the adherent cells, and after 2 days of culture continued, 1ml of fresh medium was added to each well, and 3. mu.l of 100. mu.g/ml TNF- \u03b1 was added to each well on day 5 to give a final concentration of 100ng/ml (TNF- \u03b1 was purchased from Peprotech, Cat #: AF-300-01A), and culture was continued for 2 days, and the resultant Dendritic Cells (DCs) were used in the following experiments.</p>"
