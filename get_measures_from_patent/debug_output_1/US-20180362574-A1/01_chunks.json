R01 CA077743 and P30 DK079310 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.</p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONPolycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of numerous cysts in the kidneys of a subject. PKD is among the most common life-threatening genetic diseases in the world and is a leading cause of end-stage renal failure and a common indication for dialysis or renal transplantation (Wilson, N. Engl. J. Med. 2004, 350, 151-164). The kidneys filter wastes and extra fluid from the blood to form urine and also regulate amounts of certain vital substances in the subject. When cysts form in the kidneys, they are filled with fluid. PKD cysts can profoundly enlarge the kidneys while replacing much of the normal structure, resulting in reduced kidney function and leading to kidney failure. PKS includes autosomal dominant PKD (ADPKD) and autosomal recessive PKD (ARPKD). ADPKD is the more common inherited form of PKD, whereas ARPKD is a rare inherited form. It has been reported that mutations in two genes, PKD1 and PKD2, which encode polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2), respectively, may be responsible for ADPKD (Gallagher et al., Adv. Chronic Kidney Dis. 2010, 17(2): 118-130; The European Polycystic Kidney Disease Consortium, Cell 1994, 78:725; The International Polycystic Kidney Disease Consortium, Cell 1995, 81:289-298; Mochizuki et al., Science 1996, 272:1339-1342; The European Polycystic Kidney Disease Consortium, Cell 1994, 77, 881-894). A causative gene ARPKD has been thought to be PKHD1, which encodes fibrocystin/polyductin (FPC).</p>PKD can also cause cysts in the liver and problems in other organs, such as blood vessels in the brain and heart. For example, polycystic liver disease (PLD) is an inherited condition characterized by the presence of multiple scattered cysts of biliary origin throughout the liver parenchyma (Fedeles et al., Nature Genetics 2011, 43(7):639-648; Qian et al., Hepatology 2003, 37, 164-171). PLD occurs frequently as an extra-renal manifestation of ADPKD, but it also exists as a distinct dominantly inherited genetic entity without kidney cysts (autosomal dominant PLD (ADPLD)). Mutations in PRKCSH or SEC63 may underlie isolated ADPLD (Reynolds et al., Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000, 67, 1598-1604; Li et al., Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2003, 72, 691-703; Davila et al., Nat. Genet. 2004, 36, 575-577; Drenth et al., Nat. Genet. 2003, 33, 345-347).</p>PC1, PC2, and FPC, along with one Meckel syndrome gene product (MKS3) (Smith et al., Nat. Genet. 2006, 38, 191-196), have been reported to be the only integral membrane proteins mutated in cilia-associated fibrocystic diseases (Sharma et al., Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2008, 85, 371-427). ADPKD and ADPLD are also unique in that they may be the only dominantly inherited traits among the cilia-associated diseases (Menezes et al., Methods Cell Biol. 2009, 94, 273-297).</p>Subjects with PKD (e.g., ADPKD) may be treated by hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or renal transplantation. Treatment of PLD (e.g., ADPLD) may include cyst aspiration, cyst fenestration, liver resection, and liver transplantation. Currently, there are no FDA-approved therapeutic drugs that directly target PKD. Several clinical trials are underway testing the cAMP inhibitor (Tolvaptan) or excessive intake of water as means to slow down the progression of PKD. Certain mTOR inhibitors, such as rapamycin, have been studied in clinical trials, but those mTOR inhibitors have not shown significant clinical effectiveness. Therefore, there remains a need for improved treatment of PKD and PLD.</p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention provides compounds of Formula (I) or (II), which are thought to be able to inhibit mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling pathway, induce UPR (unfolded protein response), and/or perturb mitochondrial function of a cyst cell (e.g., a cyst cell causing polycystic kidney disease (PKD, e.g., autosomal dominant PKD (ADPKD) or autosomal recessive PKD (ARPKD)) or polycystic liver disease (PLD, e.g., autosomal dominant PLD (ADPLD) or autosomal recessive PLD (ARPLD)).

The role of polycystin-2 (PC2) as a calcium channel and of polycystin-1 (PC1) as a receptor regulating its activity has led to a focus on calcium in the cellular ADPKD phenotype. Direct assessment of any calcium effects in the cilia compartment has been limited, but studies examining total cellular calcium have provided some insights. As a member of the TRP family of ion channel proteins abundantly expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), functional studies showed that PC2 over-expression enhances the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores (Koulen P, Cai Y, Geng L, Maeda Y, Nishimura S, Witzgall R, Ehrlich B E, Somlo S. Polycystin-2 is an intracellular calcium release channel. Nat. Cell Biol 2002;4:191-197). PC2 associates with a number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel proteins (TRPC1 and TRPV4) and homo-multimerizes with itself via its C-terminus (Qian F, Germino F J, Cai Y, Zhang X, Somlo S, Germino G G. PKD1 interacts with PKD2 through a probable coiled-coil domain. Nat. Genet 1997;16:179-183; Kottgen M, Buchholz B, Garcia-Gonzalez M A, Kotsis F, Fu X, Doerken M, Boehlke C, Steffi D, Tauber R, Wegierski T, et al. TRPP2 and TRPV4 form a polymodal sensory channel complex. J. Cell Biol 2008;182:437-447; Tsiokas L, Arnould T, Zhu C, Kim E, Walz G, Sukhatme V P. Specific association of the gene product of PKD2 with the TRPC1 channel. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A 1999;96:3934-3939; Zhang P, Luo Y, Chasan B, Gonzalez-Perrett S, Montalbetti N, Tim",
    "ology of cystic disease remains to be determined, these studies do lend support to the hypothesis that the polycystins impact a physiologically critical second messenger pathway that may influence a broad array of cellular functions. Several studies report that cAMP levels are elevated in cyst epithelial cells and furthermore that cAMP stimulates cyst fluid and electrolyte secretion (Belibi F A, Reif G, Wallace D P, Yamaguchi T, Olsen L, Li H, Helmkamp G M Jr. Grantham J J. Cyclic AMP promotes growth and secretion in human polycystic kidney epithelial cells. Kidney In need thereof 2004;66:964-973; Yamaguchi T, Pelling J C, Ramaswamy N T, Eppler J W, Wallace D P, Nagao S, Rome L A, Sullivan L P, Grantham J J. cAMP stimulates the in vitro proliferation of renal cyst epithelial cells by activating the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway. Kidney Int 2000;57:1460-1471). CFTR has been proposed as the apical chloride channel responsible for driving fluid secretion, providing a possible molecular explanation for cAMP's pro-secretory effects (Brill S R, Ross K E, Davidow C J, Ye M, Grantham J J, Caplan M J. Immunolocalization of ion transport proteins in human autosomal dominant polycystic kidney epithelial cells. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A 1996;93:10206-10211; Sullivan L P, Wallace D P, Grantham J J. Epithelial transport in polycystic kidney disease. Physiol Rev 1998;78:1165-1191). A report that small-molecule inhibitors of CFTR reduced cyst growth in a murine model of PKD (Yang B, Sonawane N D, Zhao D, Somlo S, Verkman A S. Small-molecule CFTR inhibitors slow cyst growth in polycystic kidney disease. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol 2008;19:1300-1310) support a role for CFTR in cyst growth. In vivo genetic studies combining CFTR and PKD mutant mice have not been reported. Whether CFTR is the sole channel responsible for fluid secretion in cysts is uncertain since CFTR does not appear to be expressed in all cysts (Lebeau C, Hanaoka K, Moore-Hoon M L, Guggino W B, Beauwens R, Devuyst O. Basolateral chloride transporters in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Pflugers Arch 2002;444:722-731). The reasons for the high cytosolic cAMP concentrations in cyst cells is not well understood. It is possible that the perturbations in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels may in part account for dysregulation of cAMP in cyst cells. The polycystin proteins may directly or indirectly alter the activities of G-protein coupled receptors that signal through cAMP. Expression and activity of the V2 vasopressin receptor, for example, is elevated in a number of animal models of PKD (Belibi F A, Reif G, Wallace D P, Yamaguchi T, Olsen L, Li H, Helmkamp G M Jr. Grantham J J. Cyclic AMP promotes growth and secretion in human polycystic kidney epithelial cells. Kidney In need thereof 2004;66:964-973; Gattone V H, Wang X, Harris P C, Torres V E. Inhibition of renal cystic disease development and progression by a vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist. Nat. Med 2003;9:1323-1326). This fact is being exploited through the development of V2 receptor antagonists as potential therapeutic agents that can potentially slow or prevent cyst fluid accumulation by reducing cytosolic cAMP levels (Gattone V H, Wang X, Harris P C, Tones V E. Inhibition of renal cystic disease development and progression by a vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist. Nat. Med 2003;9:1323-1326; Tones V E, Wang X, Qian Q, Somlo S, Harris P C, Gattone V H. Effective treatment of an orthologous model of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Nat. Med 2004;10:363-364).</p>The mitogen activated protein kinase/extracellular regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) cascade couples extracellular signals received by a variety of surface receptors, through the activation of small G-proteins and the involvement of a variety of adaptors, to the successive phosphorylation of Raf, MEK, and MAP kinase/ERK. Activated MAPK/ERK can modulate protein translation and can enter the nucleus to regulate the activities of transcription factors and the cell cycle. Activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway occurs in cell culture based mo",
    " (in vitro) or TUNEL staining (in vivo) (FIG. 4A and FIG. 4B). Apoptosis markers, such as cleaved PARP were also significantly increased in the treated tissues, in vivo (FIG. 4C). Importantly, the effect of compound I-1 was specific in vivo, as the vast majority of apoptotic cells stained positive for DBA (where the Cre is active; FIG. 4A) whereas LTA-positive cells did not exhibit increased apoptosis in compound I-1 compared to the control. These data indicate that compound I-1 is a potent and specific inducer of apoptosis of PKD1 null cells both in vitro and in vivo.</p>Example 5Oxidative Stress in Kidneys Treated with Compound I-1mRNA levels of oxidative stress responsive genes Catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD1) were analyzed by qPCR. Exemplary results are shown in FIG. 5. mRNA levels were increased (6-fold (***p&lt;0.001) and 4-fold (*p&lt;0.05), respectively) when mouse (the early model) cystic kidneys were treated with compound I-1. This suggests that the ability of compound I-1 to induce oxidative stress was selective for the cystic cells and did not happen in the normal (wild-type) cells.</p>Example 6Efficacy of Compound I-1 in an Adult Mouse ModelAn adult model (\u201cadult Pax8\u201d), the doxycycline inducible Pax8rtTA; Tet O-Cre; Pkd1flox/flox mouse, was used (Ma et al., Nat. Genet. 2013, 45(9):1004-1012). These mice received doxycycline in the drinking water from P28 P42 to induce Cre and inactivate Pkd1. The adult mouse model inactivates the PKD1 gene (which causes PKD) after the mice are adult, and thus the adult mouse model mimics the human with PKD. This is considered the gold standard mouse model in the PKD field. Treatment was started at P42 with 3\u00d7/week i.p. injection of compound I-1 for 12 weeks. The mice were examined at the end of that period at the age of 18 weeks. It was observed that compound I-1 was very effective at slowing down cyst growth, as evidenced by kidney morphology, a significant 2.5 fold (***p&lt;0.001) decrease in the kidney/body ratio and a 2-fold (***p&lt;0.001) decrease in BUN (indicating improved kidney function). Exemplary results are shown in FIG. 6A to FIG. 6C.</p>Example 7Efficacy of Compound 1-3 in an Early Mouse ModelCompound 1-3 was tested using the methods described in Example 4. Exemplary results are shown in FIG. 7A to FIG. 7C. Compound 1-3 worked very well, as shown by the smaller kidney morphology (FIG. 7A), a 2-fold (**p&lt;0.01) decrease in the kidney/body ratio (FIG. 7B), and 1.5 fold (**p&lt;0.01) decrease in BUN (improved kidney function) (FIG. 7C). Compound 1-3 may be even more active than compound I-1, as in this experiment, mice were treated with compound 1-3 at a 5 mg/kg dose, half of the dose of compound I-1. It was also shown that the ability of compounds I-1 to damage DNA (the aniline mustard group) was not necessary for the activity of the compounds against PKD.</p>Example 8Compound I-1 Up-Regulated the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) in the Cystic KidneysIncreased (2.5 fold, **p&lt;0.01) mRNA levels (by qPCR) of spliced XBP1 (XBP1s, the activated form of XBP1) were observed when mouse (the early model) cystic kidney was treated with compound I-1 (FIG. 8A). This result signified up-regulated UPR. What were also observed include increased protein levels (by Western blotting) of XBP1s and of caspase-12, a downstream effector of XBP1s (FIG. 8B). The upregulation of caspase-12 may be through the mechanism by which activation of UPR leads to cell death.</p>Equivalents and ScopeIn the claims articles such as \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d may mean one or more than one unless indicated to the contrary or otherwise evident from the context.
