    "-oxa-fenchyl\n                               1000*\n______________________________________\n *based on informal panel testing\n</pre></p>Synthesis of alpha-L-aspartyl-D-phenylglycine esters and amidesThe alpha-L-aspartyl-D-phenylglycine esters of the present invention can be synthesized according to the following 4-step reaction scheme: ##STR15## In the first step, carbobenzyloxy (Z) protected D-phenylglycine 1 is coupled with alcohol R'OH using dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC)/dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). In the second step, the ester formed in step 1 is hydrogenated over palladium to remove the protecting group to form the phenylglycine ester 2. In the third step, ester 2 is coupled to the protected activated L-aspartic ester 3 to form the protected L-aspartyl-D-phenylglycine ester 4. In the fourth step, the protecting groups are removed by hydrogenation of ester 4 over palladium to yield sweetener 5.</p>Alcohols R'OH used in this synthesis are made according to the process disclosed in U.S. application Ser. No. 630,464 to John M. Cardik, filed July 13, 1984 (Case 3295) (herein incorporated by reference). This process involves the following 4-step reaction scheme: ##STR16##</p>In the first step, alcohol 6 is converted to the xanthate ester 7 by using NaH, carbon disulfide and methyl iodide. In the second step, xanthate ester 7 is thermally decomposed to the methylene substituted bicyclic compound 8. In the third step, bicyclic compound 8 is converted to ketone 9 by using ozone, KI and acetic acid. In the fourth step, ketone 9 is reduced to alcohol 10.</p>Syntheses of specific alpha-L-aspartyl-D-phenylglycine esters are as follows:</p>EXAMPLE 1: alpha-7-oxa-Fenchyl esterStep 1N-Carbobenzyloxy-D-phenylglycine-(\u00b1)-alpha-7-oxa-fenchyl estera. N-Carbobenzyloxy-D-phenylglycineTo D-phenylglycine (50 g., 0.33 moles, Aldrich) is added 82 ml. of 4N NaOH. The mixture is cooled to 0\u00b0 C. and carbobenzoxy chloride (51 ml., 0.36 moles) is added dropwise. Additional NaOH is added as needed to keep the reaction mixture basic. After stirring for 10 minutes, 200 ml. of H<sub>2</sub> O is added. After 10 minutes, the solution is filtered. The clear filtrate is extracted twice with ether and is then adjusted to pH 3 with 5N HCl. The resulting precipitate is filtered, washed twice with H<sub>2</sub> O and then dried. The crude product is dissolved in ethyl acetate and then filtered. The filtrate is evaporated and the resulting solid crystallized from ethyl acetate/hexane.</p>b.

N-Carbobenzyloxy-D-phenylglycine-(\u00b1)-alpha-7-oxa-fenchyl esterThe N-carbobenzyloxy-D-phenylglycine (20 g., 0.07 moles) from step 1a is dissolved in about 150 ml. of dry methylene chloride. The (\u00b1)-alpha-7-oxa-fenchol (10.9 g., 0.07 moles) from step 1b and N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (17.3 g., 0.083 moles) are then added after cooling the solution to 0\u00b0 C.
