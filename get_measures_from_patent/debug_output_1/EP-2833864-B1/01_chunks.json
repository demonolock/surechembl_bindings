    "ze of at least 1.0 mm and preferably 3 mm;d. delumping the granulate for example by sieving through a sieve with a mesh size of 0.6 mm-1.6 mm, preferably 1.0 mm;e. and adding a diluent and a disintegrant and blending in a suitable blenderf. adding preferably sieved lubricant to the granulate for final blending for example in a cube mixer.</p>In an alternative process part of the excipients such as part of a disintegrant or a diluent or an additional disintegrant can be added intragranular prior to extrusion of step b.</p>For the preparation of tablets or tablet cores the final blend is further compressed into tablets of the target tablet core weight with appropriate size and crushing strength, using an appropriate tablet press.</p>For the preparation of film-coated tablets a coating suspension is prepared and the compressed tablet cores are coated with the coating suspension to a weight gain of about 2-4 %, preferably about 3%, using a standard film coater. The film-coating solvent is a volatile component, which does not remain in the final product. To reduce the required amount of lubricant in the tablets it is an option to use an external lubrication system.</p>EXAMPLESThe present invention is directed to pharmaceutical formulations comprising compounds of formula 1. This pharmaceutical formulations can be used for the treatment of diseases connected with the CCR3 receptor. A CCR3 receptor binding test showing this activity was already disclosed in WO 2010 115836</patcit>. Ki values for the compounds of formula 1 (human Eotaxin-1 at human CCR3-Rezeptor) are shown in the table below. As used herein, \"activity\" is intended to mean a compound demonstrating an inhibition of 50% at 1\u00b5M or higher in inhibition when measured in the aforementioned assays. Such a result is indicative of the intrinsic activity of the compounds as inhibitor of CCR3 receptor activity.</p>The examples of compounds of formula 1 can be synthesized according to the description of WO 2010 115836</patcit>. The salts of these examples can be formed by crystallizing the free bases from a solution containing HCl. Preferably the examples 1, 2 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 are in form of the dihydrochloride.\n#StructurehCCR3 Ki (nM)1.<img id=\"ib0003\" path=\"imgb0003.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/469246590/EP/20181219/B1/000002/83/38/64/imgb0003.tif\"/>10,42.<img id=\"ib0004\" path=\"imgb0004.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/469246591/EP/20181219/B1/000002/83/38/64/imgb0004.tif\"/>3,23.<img id=\"ib0005\" path=\"imgb0005.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/469246592/EP/20181219/B1/000002/83/38/64/imgb0005.tif\"/>3,54.<img id=\"ib0006\" path=\"imgb0006.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/469246593/EP/20181219/B1/000002/83/38/64/imgb0006.tif\"/>4,35.<img id=\"ib0007\" path=\"imgb0007.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/469246594/EP/20181219/B1/000002/83/38/64/imgb0007.tif\"/>4,66.<img id=\"ib0008\" path=\"imgb0008.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/469246595/EP/20181219/B1/000002/83/38/64/imgb0008.tif\"/>4,07.<img id=\"ib0009\" path=\"imgb0009.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/469246596/EP/20181219/B1/000002/83/38/64/imgb0009.tif\"/>5,28.<img id=\"ib0010\" path=\"imgb0010.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/469246597/EP/20181219/B1/000002/83/38/64/imgb0010.tif\"/>2,39.<img id=\"ib0011\" path=\"imgb0011.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/469246598/EP/20181219/B1/000002/83/38/64/imgb0011.tif\"/>4,210.<img id=\"ib0012\" path=\"imgb0012.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/469246599/EP/20181219/B1/000002/83/38/64/imgb0012.tif\"/>1,7<"
