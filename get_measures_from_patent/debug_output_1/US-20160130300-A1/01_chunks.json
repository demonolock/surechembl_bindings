    "cterial pellets collected from the expression of genotype 3 HCV NS3 protease were homogenized in Lysis Buffer (25 mM tris, pH 7.5 buffer containing 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)) and passed through a microfluidizer at 18,000 pounds/in<sup>2</sup>. Homogenized cell lysates were centrifuged at 30,000\u00d7g for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. The resulting P1 pellets were washed with Wash Buffer I (25 mM tris, pH 7.5 containing 1% CHAPS) followed by centrifugation at 10,000\u00d7g for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. The resulting P2 pellets were washed with Wash Buffer II (50 mM CAPS buffer, pH 10.8, containing 2M NaCl and 2M urea) followed by centrifugation at 30,000\u00d7g for minutes at 4\u00b0 C. The resulting P3 pellets were resuspended in Solubilization Buffer (20 ml of 25 mM tris, pH 7.5 containing 150 mM NaCl and 8 M urea) and incubated at 4\u00b0 C. for one hour. Solubilized proteins were passed through a 0.45 micron filter. Protein concentrations were measured and the solutions were adjusted to 40 mM DTT, incubated for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. and then quickly diluted into Refolding Buffer (25 mM tris, pH 8.5, 0.8 M Guanidine-HCl, 0.4 M L-Arginine, 10 mM ZnSO<sub>4</sub>) while stirring. Protein solutions were incubated at 4\u00b0 C. overnight to allow refolding. Refolded proteases were centrifuged at 30,000\u00d7g for 10 minutes to remove residual precipitates. Final protein concentrations were then measured and the NS3 proteases were aliquoted, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C.</p>Ki Determination for Genotypes 1b and 3a NS3 Protease.Purified NS3 protease domain (amino acids 1-181) of the genotype 1b and 3a virus were generated as above. The internally quenched fluorogenic depsipeptide substrate Ac-DED(Edans)-EEAbu\u03a8[COO]ASK(Dabcyl)-NH<sub>2 </sub>and a synthetic peptide containing the hydrophobic core residues of the NS4A protein cofactor (KKGSVVIVGRIILSGRKK; NS4A peptide) were obtained from Anaspec, Inc. (San Jose, Calif.). Other chemicals and biochemicals were of reagent grade or better and were purchased from standard suppliers.</p>Reactions were run at room temperature in buffer consisting of 50 mM HEPES, 40% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10 mM DTT, and 10% DMSO. The final assay solutions contained 50 \u03bcM NS3 genotype 1b protease or 200 \u03bcM genotype 3a protease, 20 \u03bcM NS4A peptide, and 4 \u03bcM substrate (genotype 1b) or 2 \u03bcM substrate (genotype 3a). Inhibitor concentrations varied from 100 nM to 5 \u03bcM in 3-fold dilutions, and no-inhibitor controls were included.</p>Compound dilutions were made in DMSO at 20\u00d7 final concentration. Reaction mixtures were prepared in 96-well assay plates. A solution of enzyme and NS4A peptide in assay buffer (25 \u03bcL volume with both reagents at 4\u00d7 final concentration) was mixed with 45 \u03bcL assay buffer and 5 \u03bcL of either inhibitor or DMSO, and pre-incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. The reaction was started by addition of 25 \u03bcL substrate solution at 4\u00d7 final concentration. Plates were mixed vigorously for 5-10 seconds and reactions were allowed to proceed for 90 minutes. fluorescence was measured every 30 s between 90 and 120 minutes reaction time using a Tecan InfiniTe M1000 or PerkinElmer Envision multimode plate reader with an excitation wavelength of 340 nm and an emission wavelength of 490 nm.</p>Rates were calculated from the progress curves at steady state, in the time frame of 90-120 minutes after addition of substrate. To determine the K, rates were plotted as a function of inhibitor concentration, and the data were fit with equation 1 (Morrison, J. F., Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1969, 185, 269-286) to calculate K<sub>i</sub><sup>app </sup>using GraphPad Prism 5. Active fraction of enzyme was determined by active site titration with known potent inhibitors. K was calculated from K<sub>i</sub><sup>app</sup>/(1+[[S]/K<sub>m</sub>]). Ki results for representative compounds for genotype 1b and 3a (Ki 1B and Ki 3A, respectively) are reported in Table 1.</p>vv0=[E]t-[I]t-Kiapp+([E]t-[I]t-Kiapp)2+4\ue8a0[E]t\ue89eKiapp2\ue89e[E]t(1)</p>Evaluation of Cell-Based Anti-HCV Activity:Antiviral potency (EC<sub>50</sub>) was determined in both stable subgenomic HCV replicon cell lines and transient-transfected HCV replicon cells. The term half maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) refers to the concentration of a drug which induces a response halfway between the baseline and maximum after the exposure time specified below.</p>Stable subgenomic HCV replicons for genotype 1a, 1b, 2a, 3a, and 4a were established in Huh-7-derived cells as described by Lohmann et al (Lohmann V, Korner F, Koch J, et al Replication of subgenomic hepatitis C virus RNAs in a hepatoma cell line. Science 1999; 285:119-3). Each stable cell line contains a bicistronic HCV replicon that encodes a humanized Renilla luciferase (hRLuc) reporter gene fused to a selectable neomycin-resistance gene, followed by an EMCV IRES and the NS3-NS5B coding region of HCV. Selection for cells constitutively expressing the HCV replicon was achieved in the presence of the selection antibiotic, neomycin (G418). Luciferase activity was measured as a marker for intracellular HCV replication levels.</p>The genotype 1a stable replicon was derived from the H77 HCV strain and contained adaptive mutations P1496L and S2204I. The genotype 1b stable replicon was derived from the Con1 HCV strain and contained adaptive mutations E1202G, T1280I, and K1846T. The genotype 2a stable replicon was derived from the JFH-1 HCV strain and did not require adaptive mutations. The genotype 3a stable replicon was derived from the S52 HCV strain and contained adaptive mutations P1121L, A1198T and S2210I (equivalent to S2204I in genotype 1). The genotype 4a stable replicon wa"
