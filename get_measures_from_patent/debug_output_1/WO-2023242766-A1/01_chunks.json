    "5-119.50, 5-119.98, 5-120, 5-121; LC-MS: RT: 29.20, m/z 1550 [M+H]+. </p>Example 2 </p>Synthesis of peptide- Au- [DTGT] </p>[0082] Protocol for the synthesis of Au-[DTGT]: To a 100 mL conical flask fitted with a magnetic stir bar, 45 mL of water, 0.5 mL of IM NaOH, and 1 mL of THPC or Tetrakis (hydroxymethyl) phosphonium chloride (comprised of 1 mL of water + 12 pL of 80% THPC) were charged and stirred for 5 min at 1000 rpm. To this mixture, 2 mL of 25 mM HAuC14.3H2O was quickly added at RT under vigorous stirring. The color of the mixture immediately turned to dark brown indicating the formation of gold nanoparticles. The suspension was allowed to stir for 15 min 1000 rpm. After 15 min, aqueous solution of m-PEG-SH, 2000 daltons (18 mg in 2 mL of H2O) was added to the nanoparticle suspension dropwise at RT under vigorous stirring (1000 rpm). The reaction mixture was continued to stir for 16 hours at 1000 rpm followed by \n\nwashing with water several times using a 10 kDa (molecular weight cut off) centrifugal filter. The final suspension of gold nanoparticles (AuNP) was concentrated to 1.5 mL. In the next step, to 0.39 mL of concentrated solution of Au NP taken in a 5 mL glass vial fitted with a magnetic stir bar, 0.61 mL of water was charged. To this solution, 0.99 mL of DTGT (5 mg/mL in H2O) was added dropwise while stirring at RT (1000 rpm). The reaction mixture was continued to stir for 16 hours. The unconjugated DTGT was removed by passing the reaction mixture through 10 KD (molecular weight cut off) centrifugal filter. The reaction mixture is further washed with water six times using the 10 KD (molecular weight cut off) centrifugal filter to obtain 0.5 mL concentrated suspension of Au-[DTGT], See also Figure 1. </p>[0083] Protocol for the synthesis of P4BN: A thioctic-bombesin peptide was synthesized following the traditional solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) procedure employing Fmoc chemistry methodology and the final peptides were purified by HPLC. A 4- hydroxymethylphenoxyacetyl- 4'-methylbenzyhydrylamine resin was used as the solid support for the synthesis. Fmoc-protected amino acids were activated using one equivalent of 0.45 M HBTU/HOBt solutions and two equivalents of N, N-di isopropyl ethylamine. The amino acids were Fmoc deprotected using piperidine and coupled using NMM.HBTU. Following the coupling of all of the amino acids in the appropriate sequence, thioctic acid (lipoic acid) was coupled using DIC.HOBt. </p>[0084] Cleavage of the peptide from the resin was performed using TFA. This cleavage step also removed the amino acid side chain protecting groups. </p>[0085] The peptide was purified on a reverse-phase HPLC/C18 column. The purity was confirmed by HPLC reverse-phase chromatography and Electrospray Mass Spectral (ESIMS) analysis. A single peak corresponding to SS-PEG4-BN SS-BN at retention time (tR) of 7.58 min was observed in HPLC validating 98% purity of the peptide. The observed m/z peak correlates well with the calculated molecular ion peak expected for the peptide. The ESI-MS spectrum of pure P4BN shows two peaks, one corresponding to th"
