    "n binding site on a single molecule. Single-chain antibody variable fragments (scFvs) in which the C-terminus of one variable domain is tethered to the N-terminus of the other variable domain via a 15 to 25 amino acid peptide or linker have been developed without significantly disrupting antigen binding or specificity of the binding. The linker is chosen to permit the heavy chain and light chain to bind together in their proper conformational orientation.</p>Divalent single-chain variable fragments (di-scFvs) can be engineered by linking two scFvs. This can be done by producing a single peptide chain with two V<sub>H </sub>and two V<sub>L </sub>regions, yielding tandem scFvs. ScFvs can also be designed with linker peptides that are too short for the two variable regions to fold together (about five amino acids), forcing scFvs to dimerize. This type is known as diabodies. Diabodies have been shown to have dissociation constants up to 40-fold lower than corresponding scFvs, meaning that they have a much higher affinity to their target. Still shorter linkers (one or two amino acids) lead to the formation of trimers (triabodies or tribodies). Tetrabodies have also been produced. They exhibit an even higher affinity to their targets than diabodies.</p>A bi-specific antibody designed to selectively bind CD3 and CD33 would trigger non-specific T-cell activation &amp; cytokine storm. A bi-specific diabody designed to selectively bind CD3 and CD33 would have a molecular weight (55-60 kD) less than the renal clearance threshold, which would result in rapid elimination. As such, diabodies must be administered by a continuous infusion. The disclosed tetravalent, bi-specific antibody can have a molecular weight (e.g., 105-110 kD) greater than the renal filtration threshold with markedly extended PK.</p>Provided are fusion polypeptides capable of forming a multivalent engineered antibody that is able to engage T-cells to destroy CD33-expressing malignant cells. The engineered antibody may comprise for example, at least one scFv, at least one Fab fragment, at least one Fv fragment, etc. It may be bivalent, trivalent, tetravalent, etc. The multivalent antibodies is multispecific, e.g., bispecific, trispecific, tetraspecific, etc. The multivalent antibodies may be in any form, such as a diabody, triabody, tetrabody, etc.</p>Bivalent and bispecific antibodies can be constructed using only antibody variable domains. A fairly efficient and relatively simple method is to make the linker sequence between the V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>domains so short that they cannot fold over and bind one another. Reduction of the linker length to 3-12 residues prevents the monomeric configuration of the scFv molecule and favors intermolecular VH-VL pairings with formation of a 60 kDa non-covalent scFv dimer \u201cdiabody\u201d. The diabody format can also be used for generation of recombinant bis-pecific antibodies, which are obtained by the noncovalent association of two single-chain fusion products, consisting of the VH domain from one antibody connected by a short linker to the VL domain of another antibody. Reducing the linker length still further below three residues can result in the formation of trimers (\u201ctriabody\u201d, a"
