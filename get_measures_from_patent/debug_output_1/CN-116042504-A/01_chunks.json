    "le the methods and applications of this invention have been described in terms of preferred embodiments, it will be apparent to those skilled in the relevant art that the invention can be practiced and practiced with modification and alteration and combination of the methods and applications herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>Embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail below with reference to examples, but it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the following examples are only for illustrating the present invention and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the present invention. The specific conditions are not noted in the examples and are carried out according to conventional conditions or conditions recommended by the manufacturer. The reagents or apparatus used were conventional products commercially available without the manufacturer's attention.</p>Example 1</p>Preparing a medlar extract:</p>1. fresh frozen matrimony vine is taken, placed in a homogenizer, PBS buffer (matrimony vine: PBS buffer=1:3/W: W) is added, broken into homogenates (3 times at 10000rpm, 60s each), ultrasonic energy 25%, ultrasonic 20min.</p>2. Filtering with 200 mesh filter bag, centrifuging at 4deg.C and 10000g/min for 30min, collecting supernatant, and storing at-20deg.C.</p>Extraction of extracellular vesicles of medlar:</p>1. the PBS extract of fructus Lycii is packaged into a concentration tube (membrane is 30 kD), and concentrated by centrifugation at 2500g/min at 4deg.C.</p>2. The concentrate was centrifuged at 10000g for 10min at 4\u2103to remove impurities, and the supernatant was collected.</p>3. Transferring the supernatant in the step 2 into a centrifuge tube, and centrifuging at 50000rpm for 90min at 4 \u2103 to obtain the extracellular vesicles (sediment) of the medlar. Adding PBS buffer solution, blowing thoroughly, and filtering and sterilizing extracellular vesicle solution with 0.22 \u03bcm filter membrane on an ultra-clean bench for standby.</p>Comparative example 1</p>Preparing a medlar extract:</p>1. fresh frozen matrimony vine is taken, placed in a homogenizer, added with PBS buffer (matrimony vine: PBS buffer=1:3/W: W) and crushed into homogenate (3 times 5000r each for 1 min), ultrasonic energy 25%, ultrasonic 20min.</p>2.

Since the diameter of the extracellular vesicles was about 30 to 200nm (the distribution range of the extracellular vesicles extracted in example 1), the experimenter again examined the diameter of the extracellular vesicles by using an instrument nanoflow detector (Xiamen Fu Living) in which the extracellular vesicles were diluted by a proper factor, the extracellular vesicles were added dropwise to the instrument, the detection was started by opening the procedure, and the distribution of the diameter was obtained according to the readings of the instrument, and as shown in FIG. 2, most of the extracellular "
