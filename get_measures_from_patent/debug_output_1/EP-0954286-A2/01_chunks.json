    "nce this virus strain is rarely lethal to BALB/C mice, animals were sacrificed on day 6 for lung examination. In mice infected with the virus, multiple necrotic foci were evident. Full protection was recorded when the lungs were totally free of foci. H. Statistical Analysis \n\n Differences between groups were analyzed using the two-tailed Student's t-test. Example 1: Preparation of Liposomal H/N</p>\n  The antigen was entrapped in DMPC liposomes using the dehydration-rehydration tech\u00ac nique, as follows. Dimyristoyi phosphatidylcholine (DMPC, Avanti Polar Lipids, Pelham, AL, USA, or Lipoid, Ludwigshafen, Germany), 4 g, was added to 40 ml sterile double distilled water (DDW) and dissolved at 40-45\u00b0C. The solution was homogenized for 3 min. at high pressure (10,000 psi). using the Rannie Minilab 8.30 H High Pressure Homogenizer (APV Rannie, Denmark), resulting in the formation of small unilamellar vesicles (50 nm, SUV). The SUV were sterilized by filtration through a 0.2 \u03bcm pore size filter. H/N (66\u03bcg in 0.2 ml) was added to 750 \u03bcl of the SUV (lipid/protein ratio 1000/1), and the mixture was vortexed briefly and then co-lyophilized overnight. The lipid-protein powder was hydrated by adding first 0. 1 ml DDW and then 0.65 ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4, followed by vortexing, resulting in the formation of large (mean diameter. 1.5 \u03bcm) multilamellar vesicles (MLV) con\u00ac taining H/N. The amount of protein entrapped in the liposomes was determined by the filter paper dye-binding assay, using Coomassie brilliant blue G (Minamide).</p>\n  Example 2: Preparation of Liposomal Cytokines DMPC (0.57g) and 0.02 ml of 1 % solution of BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene, an antioxi- dant) in methanol were mixed with 9 ml tertiary butanol, and the mixture was sonicated at 37 \u00b0C for 20 min to dissolve the lipid. Subsequently, GM-CSF or IL-2 (1-5 x 10<sup>6</sup> U in 9 ml HBSS + 0. 1 % BSA) was added, and the lipid-cytokine mixture was further sonicated for 20 min at room temperature and lyophilized overnight. The powder was hydrated by adding 9 ml DDW and immediately shaking (Labline Multi Wrist Shaker, Melrose Park, IL, USA) for 30 min at room temperature. The above GM-CSF-loaded liposomes and IL-2-loaded liposomes (mean diameter, 1.5 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcm) were diluted in HBSS/0.1 % BSA and stored at 4\u00b0C. Lipo\u00ac somes containing cytokines were separated from the free, nonencapsulated cytokines by centrifugation (Eppendorf centrifuge model 5415C) at 14,000 rpm for 15-20 min. This tech\u00ac nique resulted in almost 100% recovery of the liposomal lipids in the liposome fraction. To measure encapsulation efficiency, the liposomes were first separated from the medium as described above. The level of biologically active cytokines was then determined in the original preparation, in the liposome-free medium and in the isolated liposomes by bioassays, described above. For maximum exposure ( &gt; 95%) of the liposomal cytokines, the liposomes were sonicated for 30-40 min at 4-8\u00b0C. This"
