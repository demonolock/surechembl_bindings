A series of immunological assays were performed to assess their effect on isolated human PBMC and whole blood T cell proliferation, activation and cytokine production. In addition, nb was converted to CD4 immune probes for optical imaging by site directed fluorescent labeling and its ability to visualize human CD4 positive tissue in a mouse xenograft ",
    "itive binders were identified. Sequence analysis revealed 13 unique Nb expressed as five different B cell lineages according to their Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs) 3 (fig. 1A). One representative Nb of each lineage, designated CD4-Nb1 to CD4-Nb5, was expressed in bacteria (e.coli) and isolated in high purity using immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) followed by Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) (fig. 1B). To test whether the selected Nb was able to bind to full length hCD4 located on the plasma membrane of mammalian cells, CHO-hCD4 cells were subjected to living cell staining (fig. 1C). The image shows plasma membrane staining at 4 \u2103, where the fluorescent signal localizes to the whole cell body at 37 \u2103, possibly as a result of receptor-bound Nb endocytosis. CHO wild-type cells were not stained with any of the five CD4-Nb at both temperatures (data not shown). Both CD4-Nb1 and CD4-Nb3 were identified by whole cell panning, showing strong staining of CHO-hCD4 cells. In Nb derived from panning with recombinant hCD4, CD4-Nb2 also showed strong cell staining, where staining with CD4-Nb4 showed weak signal, and CD4-Nb5 was not stained under these conditions and was therefore excluded from further analysis (fig. 1C).</p>To quantitatively assess affinity, a biofilm interference technique (BLI) measurement of serially diluted Nb was performed on the biotinylated extracellular domain of sensor tip immobilized hCD4. For CD4-Nb1 and CD4-Nb2, the measured KD values were in the low nanomolar range of about 5 and about 7nM, respectively, while CD4-Nb3 and CD4-Nb4 showed lower affinities of 75nM and 135nM, respectively (FIG. 1D, table 1, FIG. 6A). In addition, corresponding EC50 values were determined by flow cytometry on HEK293-hCD4 cells using full length plasma membrane localized hCD4. Based on cell staining and biochemistry measured affinities, these values reveal strong functional binding of CD4-Nb1 and CD4-Nb2 to EC50 values in the subnanomolar range (about 0.7 nM), where CD4-Nb3 and CD4-Nb4 exhibit substantially low cell affinities (FIG. 1E, table 1, FIG. 6A). Here, by way of example, four CD4-Nb were produced that bound isolated or cell-colonized hCD4. When CD4-Nb4 exhibits lower affinity, CD4-Nb1 and CD4-Nb2 exhibit high affinity in the low nanomolar range.</p>Domain mapping</p>Next, enzymatic coupling was performed using transpeptidase A for site-directed functionalization of CD 4-Nb. Thus, peptides bound to a single fluorophore bind to the C-terminus of CD4-Nb, yielding a defined label ratio of 1:142. Live cell immunofluorescence imaging with CD4-Nb transpeptidase-coupled fluorescent dye CF568 showed that all CD4-Nb retained their ability to bind to hCD4 in cell engraftment of CHO-hCD4 cells (data not shown). To localize the binding site of selected CD4-Nb, domain deletion mutants of hCD4 were generated. Expression and surface localization of these mutants was confirmed by staining with antibody RPA-T4 binding to CD4 domain D1. For mutants lacking domain D1, an N-terminal BC2 tag 43 was introduced to allow for viable cell surface detection with fluorescent labeled bivBC-Nb 42 (data not shown). The binding of the transiently expressed domain deletion mutant to CF 568-labeled CD4-Nb was tested by live cell immunofluorescence imaging. As a control, non-specific fluorescent labeled GFP-conjugated Nb (GFP-Nb) was added (fig. 2A, data not shown).</p>Based on these results, CD4-Nb1 and ",
    "o the control group, the tumor of mice injected with CD4-Nb1-Cy5.5 had about 4-fold higher Cy5.5 SI, indicating that the signal-to-noise ratio of Nb-derived fluorescent-labeled immune probes was good even in the latter stage.</p>To confirm CD 4-specific targeting of CD4-Nb1 in xenografts, in vitro immunofluorescence was performed on HPB-ALL tumors at 2 hours and 24 hours post injection (fig. 13). In early stages, CD4-Nb1 was widely distributed throughout the tumor when OI signal peaked in vivo, and Cy5.5 signal was not detected in GFP-Nb injected mice (FIG. 13A, B). Semi-quantitative analysis at the single cell level revealed strong binding of CD4-Nb1 in the HBP-ALL cell surface associated with CD4 antibody signaling and internalization of CD4-Nb1 in some cells (fig. 13C). No Nb binding was observed when irrelevant GFP-Nb was administered (fig. 13D). The strongly internalized CD4-Nb1 regions were observed 24 hours after injection (FIGS. 13E, G), but also showed low residual CD4-Nb1 uptake regions (FIG. 13E, H).</p>Optical imaging data from the explant model clearly shows that high affinity CD4-Nb1, but not CD4-Nb4, is suitable for specific visualization of cd4+ cells in vivo within a short time (30-120 minutes) after dosing. Since this model does not reflect the natural distribution of cd4+ T cells in an organism, a model that allows for visualization of the physiological composition of cd4+ immune cells continues to be used. Thus, a humanized CD4 mouse knock-in model (hCD 4 KI) was used, in which the extracellular portion of the mouse CD4 antigen was replaced with hCD4, while restoring normal immune function and T cell distribution.</p><sup>64</sup> Specific accumulation of Cu-CD4-Nb1 in CD4+ T cell-enriched organ</p>To generate an immuno PET compatible tracer, CD4-Nb1 and GFP-Nb were labeled with PET isotope 64Cu using copper chelating BCN-NODAGA groups added to azide-coupled Nb. Radiolabeled produced high radiochemical purity (. Gtoreq.95%), specific binding of in vitro 64Cu-hCD4-Nb1 to CD 4-expressing HBP-ALL cells (46.5% + -5.6%) was about 30-fold higher than non-specific binding to CD4 negative DHL cells or radiolabeled 64Cu-GFP-Nb controls (data not shown). Then <sup>64</sup> Cu-CD4-Nb1 was intravenously injected into hCD4KI and wild-type C57BL/6 mice and PET/MRI was repeated over 24 hours. As expected for the small immune tracer, 64Cu-CD4-Nb1 cleared rapidly from blood, lung and liver by renal clearance after the initial uptake peak occurred within the first 10 minutes. Mice bearing hCD4 antigen on T cells had increased accumulation of tracer in lymph nodes, thymus, liver and spleen compared to wild type (see figure 23A). Of these organs known to carry large numbers of cd4+ T cells, discrimination of cd4+ specific signals from the organ background was optimal 3 hours after injection (see figure 23B). Here, the accumulation amount of <sup>64</sup> Cu-CD4-Nb1 in lymph node of hCD4KI mouse was about 3 times that of wild type mouse, about 2.5 times in spleen and about 1.4 times in liver (see FIG. 23C). In contrast, similar levels of uptake by blood, muscle, lung and kidney were observed in both groups. In vitro biodistribution analysis 24 hours after tracer injection confirmed that <sup>64</sup> Cu-CD4-Nb1 was continuously accumulated in lymph nodes and spleens of hCD 4-expressing mice, although the number of animals per group was limited and no statistical analysis could be performed.</p>The above data strongly suggests that high affinity binding to CD4-Nb1 is suitable for visualizing cd4+ cells in vivo by non-invasive optical imaging and PET-based imaging.</p>Targeted modification/functionalization of CD4-Nb1</p>To specifically target modify/functionalize the available N-terminal amino groups using amine reactive cross-linkers, we replaced all lysine residues in CD4-Nb1 with arginine residues. Mutant versions of nanobodies have been fully expressed in bacteria and produce similar levels of yield as their non-mutant counterparts. For functional analysis, we measured the binding affinity of mutant nanobodies using biofilm interferometry. The exchange of lysine residues with arginine residues (resulting in sequence \uff1aEVQLVESGGG LVQPGGSLRL SCAASGFTFS RLAMSWHREP PGRGREWLAD IDSSGDTTDY LASVRGRFTI SRDNARNTLY LQMDSLRSED TGVYYCASRE DPPGYWGQGT QVTVSS(SEQ ID NO.156)) having no effect on binding properties, which is reflected in the affinity (KD) of mutant CD4-Nb1 to human CD4 being about 1nM, which is comparable to the affinity of unmutated CD4 as previously determined.</p>Summary discussion</p>In the invention described herein, CD4 Nb was developed that can be used as a bioinert nanobody, for example as a novel immuno-probe for visualizing and monitoring human cd4+ T cells in various biomedical research applications, with emphasis on non-invasive in vivo imaging. In addition to its use as a diagnostic agent, CD4-Nb offers a variety of therapeutic opportunities. Detailed epitope characterization is particularly interesting in view of the cellular function of CD4, since Nb may regulate endogenous CD4 according to the epitope it recognizes, e.g. by affecting transient interactions, e.g. occurring between CD4 and the mhc ii complex or by blocking ligand binding. While MHC-II binding is localized to the D1 domain of the CD4 antigen, T cell activation is abolished when TCR and CD4 co-localization is blocked by the domain.</p>From the data generated by the present invention it can be concluded that the newly generated Nb is biologically inert and thus beneficial compared to full length antibodies or other antibody fragments. Furthermore, the data presented indicate that the newly generated CD4-Nb is suitable for in vivo imaging. Considering that the selected CD4 Nb binds only human CD4 and not to mouse homologous CD4, a xenograft mouse model was used, wherein the cd4+ T leukemia tumor model was implemented based on hum"
