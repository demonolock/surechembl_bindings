{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nThe resulting Kd values for the two proteins were nearly identical with a slightly tighter binding affinity of glyco-etanercept compared with etanercept. \n\n\nNote that there is only one sentence that contains all four required components: a specific molecule name (glyco-etanercept and etanercept), a bioactivity metric (Kd), a specific numeric value is not present but it implies a comparison, and a unit is not present. However, this sentence provides context for the specific molecule and metric. If you would like to extract more context or details, please let me know."}
