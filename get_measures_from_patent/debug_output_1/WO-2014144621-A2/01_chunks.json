    "oxin levels were determined to be -0.04 EU/mg. </p> [00199] A portion of the purified material was formulated at 4.9 mg/mL in etanercept formulation buffer, 40 mg mannitol, 10 mg sucrose, 1.2 mg tromethylamine, per ml, pH 7.4. After formulation the endotoxin levels were - 0.15 EU/mg. \n\n [00200] The final material was examined with IEF acrylamide gel analysis and SDS polyacrylamide gel analysis under reducing and non reducing conditions, Figure 9 Panels A and B. </p> respectively. This analysis showed that the final product remained highly sialylated after endotoxin removal, purification and formulation. The final material was highly purified giving a single major band on gel analysis, similar to the unmodified etanercept. The molecular weight of the glyco-etanercept was about 2,000 Da higher than commercial etanercept, which was expected given the significant increase in sialic acid residues that have been added to the glycan chains. </p>[00201] Example 4: Determination of TNF Binding activity </p> [00202] The purified glyco-etanercept was evaluated for its TNF binding affinity and compared with commercial etanercept using a Forte Bio (Pall, Inc) instrument. The sensor tip of the instrument contained immobilized strepavidin. Biotinylated tumor necrosis factor was then bound to the strepavidin- coated sensor tip. Binding affinities of etanercept and glyco- etanercept for the immobilized TNF on the sensor were carried out at the concentrations shown in Figure 10. The resulting Kd values for the two proteins were nearly identical with a slightly tighter binding affinity of glyco-etanercept compared with etanercept. These results show that the addition of sialic acid residues on to the protein and the manipulations to remove endotoxin had no deleterious effect on the affinity of the molecule for the TNF protein. </p>[00203] Example 5: Glycoprofiling and glycan structural studies of N linked glycan on </p> glycoengineered etanercept </p> [00204] The glycan structures on the glycoengineered etanercept were evaluated using glycoprofiling. </p> The N-linked glycans were liberated from the protein using PNGase F treatment, followed by reductive amination, labeling with 2 amino benzamide. The glycan pool was resolved using normal phase chromatography on a BEH silica-based 1.7 \u03bc\u03b9\u03b7 column glycan HPLC column, 2.1 mm X 150 mm (Waters, inc.) using a Acquity UPLC-F1 instrument (Waters, inc) fitted with a variable wave length fluorescent detector\n<img id=\"imgf000045_0001\" path=\"imgf000045_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/276249397/WO/20140918/A2/002014/14/46/21/imgf000045_0001.tif\"/>\n nm, Figure 10. The identification of the signals was made based on their retention times using known standards and by molecular mass determinations made using MALDI-TOFF mass spectrometry. </p> [00205] The PNGase F-released glycan pool was converted to their permethylated derivatives using DMSO-NaOH and methyliodide method ( Anumula, K. and Taylor, PB., A"
