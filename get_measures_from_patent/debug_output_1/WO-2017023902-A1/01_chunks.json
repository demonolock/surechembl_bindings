The exemplified biological assays, which follow, have been carried out with compounds of the invention. </p>T F or CD40L-induced HEK-Blue assay </p> Test compounds serially diluted in DMSO were plated in an assay plate </p>(LABCYTE, Cat. # LP-0200) at final concentrations ranging from 0.004 \u03bc\u039c to 25 \u03bc\u039c. TNFa (final concentration 0.5 ng/ml) or CD40L (final concentration 30 ng/ml) in assay buffer [DMEM, 4.5 g/1 glucose (Gibco, Cat. 21063-029), 10% FBS (Sigma, F4135), 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (Gibco, Cat. 15140-122), 1% Anti-Anti (Gibco, Cat. 15240-112) and 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco, Cat. 25030-081)] was then added to the assay plate. After a 30 minute pre-incubation at 37 \u00b0C and 5% C0<sub>2</sub>, HEK-Blue\u2122-CD40L cells (INVIVOGEN, Cat. Code hkb-cd40) containing a F-kB -driven secreted alkaline \n\n phosphatase reporter gene were seeded into the assay plate at a density of 20,000 cells per well. This plate was then incubated for 18 h at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. Secreted alkaline phosphatase expression was measured using QUANTI-Blue\u2122 (INVIVOGEN, Cat. Code rep-qbl) according to manufacturer's specifications and the assay plate was read on a PerkinElmer Envision at 620 nm. </p> Inhibition data for the test compound over a range of concentrations was plotted as percentage inhibition of the test compound (100% = maximum inhibition). IC50 values were determined after correcting for background [(sample read - mean of low control)/ (mean of high control - mean of low control)] where by the low control is DMSO without stimulation and high control is DMSO with stimulation. The IC50 is defined as the concentration of test compound which produces 50% inhibition and was quantified using the 4 parameter logistic equation to fit the data. </p> Table 2 lists the IC50 values measured in the T F induced HEK-Blue assay for Examples 1 to 21 of this invention. The results in Table 2 are reported as: \"A\" represents an IC50 value of less than 1 \u03bc\u039c, \"B\" represents an IC50 value in the range of 1 \u03bc\u039c to less than 10 \u03bc\u039c; and \"C\" represents an IC50 value in the range of 10 \u03bc\u039c to 25 \u03bc\u039c. The compounds of the present invention, as exemplified by Examples 1 to 21 showed IC50 values measured in the TNF induced HEK-Blue assay of 25 \u03bc\u039c or less. </p>Table 4 </p><img id=\"imgf000083_0001\" path=\"imgf000083_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/370540382/WO/20170209/A1/002017/02/39/02/imgf000083_0001.tif\"/>\n 9 A 31 A</p>10 B 32 B</p>11 C 33 A</p>12 A 34 B</p>13 A 35 C</p>14 A 36 C</p>15 A 37 B</p>16 B 38 C</p>17 B 39 B</p>18 A 40 C</p>19 B 41 C</p>20 A 42 C</p>21 A 43 C</p>22 A - - \n</p>"
