    "ications or from abstracts thereof. Reference should be made to such patents and publications </p>themselves for their full disclosures of such classes and specific compounds within such classes, the entire disclosure of such patents and publications being incorporated herein by reference. Furthermore, examples 1-4 teach how to make compounds encompassed by the generic Formulae of (II)-(V). </p> Many AII antagonists are known in the art and may be prepared by known methods or by variations thereof. Certain AII antagonists employed in the invention may \n\nexist in isomeric form. This invention includes all such isomers both in pure form and admixture, including racemic mixtures and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. </p> Angiotensin II antagonist activity is assessed by in vitro methods. In vitro antagonist activity is determined by the ability of the compounds to compete with <sup>125</sup>I-angiotensm II for binding to vascular angiotensin II receptors and by their ability to antagonize the contractile response to angiotensin II in the isolated rabbit aorta. For the purposes of the present invention the preferred AII antagonists are compounds which are capable of inhibiting the action of AII by at least 50% at a concentration of 1mM or less, and especially preferred AII antagonists are compounds which are capable of inhibiting the action of AII by at least 50% at a concentration of 25nM or less when tested by the following standard methods. Binding </p> The radioligand binding assay is a modification of a method previously described in detail (Gunther et al., Circ. Res. 47:278, 1980). A particular fraction from rat mesenteric arteries is incubated in Tris buffer with 80 pM of 125I-angiotensin II with or without angiotensin</p>II antagonists for 1 hour at 25\u00b0C. The incubation is terminated by rapid filtration and receptor bound <sup>125</sup>I-angiotensin II trapped on the filter is quantitated with a gamma counter. The potency of angiotensin II </p>antagonists is expressed as the IC<sub>50</sub> which is the concentration of antagonist needed to displace 50% of the total specifically bound angiotensin II. </p>Aorta </p> The ability of the compounds to antagonize </p>angiotensin II induced vasoconstriction is examined in \n\n the rabbit aorta. Ring segments are cut from the rabbit thoracic aorta and suspended in organ baths containing physiological salt solution. The ring segments are mounted over metal supports and attached to force displacement transducers which are connected to a recorder. Cumulative concentration response curves to angiotensin II are performed in the absence of </p> antagonist or following a 30-minute incubation with antagonist. Antagonist dissociation constants (K<sub>B</sub>) are calculated by the dose ratio method using the mean effective concentrations. </p> In the therapeutic use for primary and secondary prevention of infarction the AII receptor antagonizing compounds of this invention are incorporated into standard "
