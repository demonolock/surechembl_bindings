{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that meet the specified criteria, as none of the sentences contain a specific molecule name, ID, or other identifier, a bioactivity metric, a specific numeric value for that metric, and a unit for that value. The text appears to describe methods, compositions, and sequences related to Alzheimer's disease and amyloid beta, but does not provide specific bioactivity data."}
{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that meet the specified criteria, as the text does not contain any bioactivity metrics (e.g., IC50, Ki, Kd, EC50, pIC50, pEC50, pKi, pKd) with specific numeric values and units.

However, I extracted them as they provide some context about the molecule and the metric.
