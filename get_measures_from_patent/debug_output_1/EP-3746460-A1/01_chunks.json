    "ences, wherein at least one of the said ABP sequences is a biologically functional molecule (i.e. can bind b-amyloid). It is quite advantageous and unexpected that the dimeric peptide may accommodate a single non-functional ABP peptide and still maintain an equivalent functional biological activity with respect to b-amyloid binding. In a dimer comprising two different ABP sequences (i.e. heterodimeric with respect to ABP), at least one of the ABP peptides provided in the heterodimer be a biologically functional ABP i.e. SEQ ID NO: 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 , 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41 , 42, 43 44, 45, 46, 47 or any combination thereof when two functional ABP peptides are provided in the heterodimer. It is not necessary that both ABP peptides in the heterodimer be biologically functional b-amyloid binding proteins, having at least one biologically functional ABP in the heterodimer maintains the overall biological activity of the fusion protein with respect to b-amyloid binding activity. It is advantageous that a heterodimer can accommodate a single non-functional ABP peptide and remain a biologically effective heterodimer. This advantage aids in the manufacturability of the provided fusion protein and allows significantly improved yield in a mixture of biologically active product. </p>The present invention provides an isolated peptide that binds b-amyloid comprising or consisting of an amino acid sequence of: </p>Xi T FX<sub>2</sub>TX<sub>3</sub>X<sub>4</sub>AS AQ AS LAS KD KTP KS KS KKX<sub>5</sub>X<sub>6</sub> </p> where X =K, G or A, X = G or A, X<sub>2</sub> = K, G or V, X<sub>3</sub> = R, G or A, X<sub>4</sub> = K, G or A, X<sub>5</sub> = R, G or V, X<sub>6</sub> = N, G or V, (SEQ ID NO: 46; 29 aa). </p>The present invention provides an isolated peptide that binds b-amyloid comprising or consisting of an amino acid sequence of: </p>Xi T FX<sub>2</sub>TX<sub>3</sub>X<sub>4</sub>AS AQ AS LAS KD KTP KS KS KKX<sub>5</sub>X<sub>6</sub>ST Q LX<sub>7</sub>SX<sub>8</sub> VXgN I (SEQ ID NO: 31 ; 40 aa) </p> wherein Xi =K, G or A, Xi = G or A, X<sub>2</sub> = K, G or V, X<sub>3</sub> = R, G or A, X<sub>4</sub> = K, G or A, X<sub>5</sub> = R, G or V, X<sub>6</sub> = N, G or V, X<sub>7</sub> = K, G or V, X<sub>8</sub> = R, G or A, X<sub>9</sub> = K, G or A, or any C-terminally cleaved b-amyloid binding product thereof. \n\n The isolated peptide amino acid sequence comprises a sequence selected from the group consisting of: </p>KT F KT R KAS AQ AS LAS KDKTPKSKSKKRGSTQLKSRVKNI (SEQ ID NO:32; 40 aa); </p>KTFKTRKASAQASLASKDKTPKSKSKKGGSTQLKSRVKNI (SEQ ID NO:33; 40 aa); </p>KTFKTRGASAQASLASKDKTPKSKSKKRGSTQLKSRVKNI (SEQ ID NO:34; 40 aa); </p>KTFKTGGASAQASLASKDKTPKSKSKKRGSTQLKSRVKNI (SEQ ID NO:35; 40 aa); </p>GTFGTGGASAQASLASKDKTPKSKSKKGGSTQLKSRVKNI (SEQ ID NO:36); 40 aa); </p>GTFGTGGASAQASLASKDKTPKSKSKKGGSTQLKSRVK (SEQ ID NO:37; 38 aa); </p>GTFGTGGASAQASLASKDKTPKSKSKKGGSTQLKSRV (SEQ ID NO:38; 37 aa); </p>GTFGTGGASAQASLASKDKTPKSKSKKGGSTQLKSR (SEQ ID NO:39; 36 aa); </p>GTFGTGGASAQASLASKDKTPKSKSKKGGSTQLKS (SEQ ID NO:40; 35 aa); </p>GTFGTGGASAQASLASKDKTPKSKSKKGGSTQLK (SEQ ID NO:41 ; 34 aa); </p>GTFGTGGASAQASLASKDKTPKSKSKKGGSTQL (SEQ ID NO:42; 33 aa); </p>GTFGTGGASAQASLASKDKTPKSKSKKGGSTQ (SEQ ID NO:43; 32 aa); </p>KTFKTRKASAQASLASKDKTPKSKSKKGGSTVKNI (SEQ ID NO:44; 35 aa); </p>KT F KT R KAS AQ AS L AS KD KT P KS KS KK RG (SEQ ID NO:45; 29 aa); </p>GTFGT GG ASAQASLAS KDKTP KS KS KKGG (SEQ ID NO: 47; 29 aa); and a sequence substantially equivalent thereto, or a C-terminally cleaved b-amyloid binding peptide thereof.

    "duced in stable CHO cell line indicating the generation of multiple forms of FC5(H3)-hFc1 x7-ABP (ABP variants) during manufacturing. A detailed Western blot analysis with anti-hFc antibody (Fig.23 A) and Mass spectroscopic analysis (Fig.23 B) revealed that different forms of the fusion protein were generated due to the C- terminal cleavage of the ABP peptide at different positions (as illustrated in SEQ ID NO: 37 to SEQ ID NO: 43 of SEQ ID NO: 36) during the production, generating bifunctional dimers, i.e. bifunctional homodimers and heterodimers with respect to ABP functionality (both the ABP arms are functional) and monofunctional heterodimers (one functional ABP arm and another non-functional arm) of the fusion proteins as depicted in Fig 1 Ai, 1 Aii and 1 Aiii. Representative Mass Spectrometric data of CEX fraction of FC5(H3)-hFc1 x7-L-ABP (6G) (SEQ ID NO: 56) dimers produced in CHO cells showing the presence of intact and C-terminally cleaved ABP (Fig. 23B). Homodimer of SEQ ID NO: 56 comprising ABP SEQ ID NO: 36 (Intact chain dimer peak), heterodimers comprising C-terminally cleaved ABP variants [SEQ ID NO: 57 (Nl, Asn- lle peak); SEQ ID NO: 60 (RVKNI peak)] and non-functional ABP (ASAQ/ASLA peak) are shown (Fig. 23B). The precise nature of the cleavage products of the fusion protein (SEQ ID NO: 56) was not known and not obvious until detailed analyses were carried out. It is further shown that the b-amyloid binding activity (Western blot Ab overlay, and ELISA assays, EC 50) of the CEX fraction containing a mixture of homodimers (bifunctional) and heterodimers (mono and bifunctional) (peak2), Fig 23A, representing about 25% of the total protein) was very similar to that of the bifunctional homo- and hetero dimers (peak3), representing approximately 65% of the total protein). This strongly indicated that the heterodimer and homodimer fractions (middle and the main peak of the CEX) can be combined without significantly losing b-amyloid binding activity. This advantageously would substantially increase the yield of FC5(H3)- \n\n hFdx7-ABP fusion protein during large-scale biomanufacturing, especially during downstream processing of the fusion protein product. This has been demonstrated in Fig. 23C, which shows that modified CEX conditions generate a fraction with high yield (over 85% of total protein applied on the column) consisting of both homodimers and heterodimers (mono and bifunctional). The b-amyloid binding activity (EC 50) of this combined pool (fractions B3 to B6) was very similar to other CEX fractions containing either predominantly homodimers (C10-D2, E12) or heterodimer forms (C6-C8). </p>Fig. 24: shows the in vivo brain delivery of the FC5(FI3)-hFc1x7-ABP fusion protein (mixture of homo- and hetero- dimers) after intra-venous injection (tail vein) of wild-type (wt) and Tg mice (see legend to Figs. 8 and 19 for details) as assessed by sandwich ELISA (24 A) and western blot analysis (24 B) which is very similar to the brain delivery of predominantly homodimeric form of FC5(H3)-hFc1x7-ABP (SEQ ID NO: 56, see Fig. 19), confirming that the heterodimeric form of FC5(H3)-hFc1 x7-ABP in the mixture does not affect brain delivery of the fusion protein across the blood-brain barrier in vivo. </p>Fig. 25: shows CSF exposure of FC5(H3)-hFc1x7-ABP fusion protein (mixture of homo- and hetero- dimers) after intra-venous injection of Tg mice and its effect on CSF b-amyloid (see Figs. 22 and 24). As shown in Fig 25, CSF exposure of FC5(H3)-hFc1x7-ABP and changes (decrease) in CSF Ab levels are very similar to that seen with predominantly homodimeric form of FC5(H3)-hFc1 x7-ABP (SEQ ID NO: 56, see Fig. 22), further confirming FC5(H3)-hFc1x7- ABP in the mixture does not affect functional efficacy of FC5(H3)-hFc1 x7-ABP fusion protein in vivo. </p>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </p> The present invention provides polypeptides, fusion proteins comprising said polypeptides, and fusion proteins co",
    "eas a BBB-permeable single-domain antibody, such as FC5 (WO 2002/057445), is fused to the N-terminus of the same Fc fragment, to create a bi-specific BBB-permeable therapeutic (Farrington et al, 2014). In a non-limiting embodiment of the present invention, the Fc fragment may be mouse (SEQ ID NO. 48) or human (SEQ ID NO: 49; SEQ ID NO: 50). In an embodiment, the Fc fragment of the present invention was engineered to reduce effector functions (Shields et al., 2001 ). For example the Fc fragment may be hFd x7 (SEQ ID NO:49) wherein the Fc fragment in the BBB-Fc-ABP fusion protein advantageously allows for the dimerization of the fusion protein to yield a therapeutically effective fusion molecule (BBB-Fc-ABP dimer) capable of transmigrating the blood brain barrier. In an embodiment, the BBB-Fc-ABP fusion protein may be FC5-H3-hFc1x7-ABP(6G) (SEQ ID NO: 56) and dimers thereof, or functionally equivalent fusion proteins of SEQ ID NO:56, namely SEQ ID NO:57, SEQ ID NO:58, SEQ ID NO:59, SEQ ID NO:60, SEQ ID NO:61 , SEQ ID NO:62, SEQ ID NO:63, SEQ ID NO:64, SEQ ID NO:65 comprising C- terminally cleaved ABP products capable of binding b-amyloid protein. The fusion protein may comprise a linker sequence L that is as embodied in SEQ ID NO: 56 or SEQ ID NO:71 , or any suitable linker sequence. </p>The present invention provides an isolated peptide which binds beta-amyloid (b-amyloid).

The present invention provides specific C-terminal deletions and mixtures comprising these C-terminal deletions. Specifically, SEQ ID NO: 36 may be cleaved at 1 amino acid from the C-terminus [-1 aa to yield a 39 amino acid cleavage product by the removal of amino acid Isoleucine (I)]; or it may be cleaved 2aa from the C-terminus (-2aa deletion of Nl, ie. the removal of Nl (Asparagine and Isoleucine); or it may be cleaved at 3 amino acid from the C-terminus (minus KNI); or it may be cleaved 4 aa from the C-terminus (removal of VKNI); or it may be cleaved at 5 amino acid from the C- terminus (minus RVKNI); or it may be cleaved at 6 amino acid from the C-terminus (minus SRVKNI); or it may be cleaved at 7 amino acid from the C-terminus (minus KSRVKNI); or it \n\n may be cleaved at 8 amino acid from the C-terminus (minus LKSRVKNI). The provided cleavage products yield functional (b-amyloid binding) peptides that may be compri",
    " dimeric peptide comprising two BBB-Fc-L-ABP single-chain polypeptides may comprise two different ABP sequences (heterodimer), wherein at least one of said ABP sequences in the heterodimer is a biologically functional ABP molecule (i.e. can bind b-amyloid, as represented in Fig 1 Aii or 1 Aiii) as described in Figs. 23, 24 and 25. It is quite advantageous that the dimeric peptide may accommodate a single non-functional ABP peptide (i.e. monofunctional heterodimer as represented in Fig.lAiii) and maintain an equivalent functional biological activity with respect to b-amyloid binding (Fig 23B, C). In a dimer comprising two different ABP sequences (i.e. heterodimeric with respect to ABP), at least one of the ABP peptides provided in the heterodimer is a biologically functional ABP i.e. SEQ ID NO: 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 , 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41 , 42, 43, 44, 45, 46 or 47 or any combination thereof when two functional ABP peptides are provided in the dimer (bifunctional heterodimer). It is quite advantageous with respect to manufacturability, isolability and functional product yield, that it is not necessary that both ABP peptides in the heterodimer be biologically functional b-amyloid binding proteins, having monofunctional (or bifunctional) heterodimers maintains the overall biological activity of the fusion protein with respect to b-amyloid binding activity in vitro (Fig 23) \n\n and in vivo brain uptake and efficacy (Figs. 24 and 25). The b-amyloid binding activity (EC 50) of the fractions containing a mixture of mono- and bi-functional homo - and hetero- dimers (PEAK 2, Fig 23A) was very similar to that of the bifunctional homo- and hetero- dimer (PEAK 3, Fig 23A allowing the mono- and bi-functional hetero- and homo-dimer fractions (PEAKS 2 and 3of the CEX) to be combined. It is advantageous that a heterodimer can accommodate a single non-functional ABP peptide (monofunctional) and remain a biologically effective heterodimer as it aids in the manufacturability of the provided fusion protein. In a specific example, combining homodimer and heterodimer pools during down-stream processing (purification) of FC5(H3)-hFc1x7-ABP fusion protein (SEQ ID NO: 56), the product yield increased significantly, from ~ 65% to ~ 86% (see Fig 23), during large-scale biomanufacturing, this is a very distinct advantage. The advantages provided by the unexpected maintenance of equivalent functionality of the monofunctional heterodimers increases the product yield and facilitates the manufacturability, permitting the ready isolation of fully-active pharmaceutical compositions (increasing fusion protein yield, which allows for an increased yield in the functional fusion protein dimers produced). Having monofunctional heterodimers that are equally active to their corresponding bifunctional dimers allows for the increased yield of the manufactured fusion protein, and thereby facilitates and increases the manufacturability of a composition comprising a mixture of ",
    "antly, changes (decrease) in CSF Ab levels were also very similar, indicating that humanization of FC5-Fc-ABP construct did not affect the PK and PD profile of the fusion construct. \n\n Example 23: Generation of C-terminallv cleaved products during the production of FC5-(H3)- hFdx7-ABP ( 6G ) fusion protein iSEQ ID NO: 56) in CHO cells. </p>The fusion protein was produced in stable CHO cell line as described in Examples 2 and 16. Following purification using Protein A affinity column (Examples 2), the fusion protein was further purified using Cation Exchange (CEX) Chromatography. CEX Chromatography profile revealed the presence of variants of FC5-(H3)-hFc1 x7-ABP (6G). Upon Western blot analyses with anti-hFc antibody (23 A) and Mass spectroscopy (23B) of each CEX fraction, it was determined that the generation of variants of the fusion protein was due to the C-terminal cleavage of the ABP peptide during the production. The C-terminal cleavage occurs at specific sites of the ABP sequence in FC5-(H3)-hFc1 x7-ABP (6G) protein, as illustrated in SEQ ID NO: 37 to SEQ ID NO: 43, which are C-terminally cleaved peptides of the SEQ ID NO: 36 ABP sequence. The C-terminal cleavage products of SEQ ID NO: 36 or an ABP having SEQ ID NO: 47 showed unexpected stability and b-amyloid binding activity when incorporated in a fusion protein in a dimeric format. Moreover, such C-terminal cleavage products advantageously maintained the equivalent biological function of b-amyloid binding activity (EC50, Fig 23 A) as assessed by ELISA and Western blot Ab overlay assays (as described in Example 2), as compared to the functional homodimeric forms. These C-terminally cleaved products advantageously increase the manufacturability and isolatable yield of functional and stable b- amyloid binding products. These stable cleavage products are not obvious and are advantageous with respect to b -amyloid binding functional peptides and corresponding fusion peptides and dimer yields. Thus, C-terminal cleavage of ABP during production in CHO-cells resulted in the generation of bifunctional homodimers, bifunctional heterodimers (both the ABP arms are functional and may contain any ABP and/or any C-terminally cleaved but functional ABP) and monofunctional heterodimers (one functional ABP in the dimer) of the fusion proteins as depicted in Fig 1 Ai, 1 Aii and 1 Aiii. The precise nature of the cleavage products of the fusion protein (SEQ ID NO: 56) was not obvious until detailed analyses were carried out and could not have been predicted in biomanufacturing and protein production. Nor was it known or obvious that the now-defined C-terminal cleavage products would advantageously bind b- amyloid and be stable peptides. The b-amyloid binding activity of the CEX fractions containing a mixture of bifunctional homodimers, and monofunctional and bifunctional heterodimers (PEAK 2, Fig 23A, (EC 50 19nM) was very similar to that of the bifunctional homodimer (PEAK 3, Fig.23A, EC 50 13nM), demonstrating that the heterodimer and homodimer fractions (PEAKS 2 and 3of the CEX) can be combined without significantly losing b-amyloid binding activity. This substantially and advantageously increases the yield and isolatability of FC5(H3)- hFd x7-ABP as a fully functional, stable fusion protein during large-scale biomanufacturing. This has been demonstrated in Fig. 23C, which shows that modified CEX conditions generate \n\n a fraction with high yield, PEAK 2, Fig. 23C, representing 86.4% of the total protein applied to the column. A typical mass spectrometric analysis of PEAK 2 consists of a mixture of the homodimer of SEQ ID NO: 56, (MW 87,695) and heterodimers comprising SEQ ID NO:56 and SEQ ID NO: 57 (MW=87,470); SEQ ID NO: 56 and SEQ ID NO: 60, (MW=87,085) and SEQ ID NO: 56 and a fully cleaved, non-functional ABP, (MW= 84,040) as shown in Figure 23B. The b- amyloid binding activity (EC 50) of this combined pool (fractions B3 to B6) was very similar to other CEX fractions containing either predominantly homodimers (C10-D2, E12) or heterodimer forms (C6-C8) as shown in Fig 23C, B and C. </p>Example 24: Brain delivery of the FC5(H3)-hFc1x7-ABP fusion protein containing a mixture of homo- and hetero- dimers </p>The transport of FC5(H3)-hFc1 x7-ABP across the blood-brain barrier and delivery to the target regions of the brain was assessed as described in Examples 8 and 19. FC5(FI3)-hFc1x7-ABP fusion protein (as a mixture of homo and heterodimers from Example 23, was administered via tail vein of wild-type (wt) and Tg mice at 15 mg/kg. After 4 hrs (data not shown) or 24 hrs following the injection, cortical and hippocampal regions of the brain were dissected and assessed as described in Example 8 and 19. As shown in Fig 24, FC5(H3)-hFc1x7-ABP fusion protein was detected in the target regions as assessed by sandwich ELISA (24 A) and western blot analysis (24 B). The results are very similar to the brain delivery of predominantly homodimeric form of FC5(H3)-hFc1 x7-ABP (SEQ ID NO: 56, see Fig. 19), further confirming that the heterodimeric form of FC5(H3)-hFc1x7-ABP in the mixture does not affect blood-brain crossing and brain delivery of the fusion protein. </p>Example 25: CSF exposure of the FC5(H3)-hFc1x7-ABP fusion protein containing a mixture of homo- and hetero- dimers and its effect on CSF B-amyloid </p>24 hrs following intra-venous administration of injection of FC5(H3)-hFc1x7-ABP into Tg mice CSF was collected and the levels of FC5(H3)-hFc1x7-ABP and b-amyloid were measured by MRM as described in Examples 5 and 22. As shown in Fig 25, CSF exposure of FC5(H3)- hFdx7-ABP and changes (decrease) in CSF Ab levels are very similar to that seen with predominantly homodimeric form of FC5(H3)-hFc1x7-ABP (SEQ ID NO: 56, see Fig. 22), further confirming FC5(H3)-hFc1x7-ABP in the mixture does not affect function efficacy of FC5(H3)-hFc1 x7-ABP fusion protein. \n\n SEQUENCES </p>\n REFERENCES </p> All patents, patent applications and publications referred to herein and throughout the application are hereby incorporated by reference. </p>Abbott NJ (2013) Blood-brain barrier structure and function and the challenges for CNS drug delivery.
