Mutagenesis mapping studies can be accomplished using methods described in the literature. See, e.g., Champe M et al., (1995) szpra and Cunningham B C &amp; Wells J A (1989) szpra for a description of mutagenesis techniques, including alanine scanning mutagenesis techniques. In a specific embodiment, an epitope of an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof is determined using alanine scanning mutagenesis studies. Epitope characterization of an antibody can also be determined by the methods provided in Ravn et al., Journal of Biological Chemistry 288: 19760-19772 (2013).</p><p id=\"p-0230\" num=\"0245\">In addition, antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof that recognize or bind to the same or overlapping epitopes of MOSPD2 (e.g., human MOSPD2) can be identified using routine techniques such as an immunoassay, for example, by showing the ability of one antibody to block the binding of another antibody to a target antigen, i.e., a competitive binding assay. Competitive binding can be determined in an assay in which the immunoglobulin under test inhibits specific binding of a reference antibody to a common antigen, such as MOSPD2. Numerous types of competitive binding assays have been described, for example: solid phase direct or indirect radioimmunoassay (RIA), solid phase direct or indirect enzyme immunoassay (EIA), sandwich competition assay (see Stahli C et al., (1983) Methods Enzymol 9: 242-253); solid phase direct biotin-avidin EIA (see Kirkland T N et al., (1986) J Immunol 137: 3614-9); solid phase direct labeled assay, solid phase direct labeled sandwich assay (see Harlow E &amp; Lane D, (1988) Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Press); solid phase direct label RIA using 1-125 label (see Morel G A et al., (1988) Mol Immunol 25(1): 7-15); solid phase direct biotin-avidin EIA (Cheung R C et al., (1990) Virology 176: 546-52); and direct labeled RIA (Moldenhauer G et al., (1990) Scand J Immunol 32: 77-82). Typically, such an assay involves the use of purified antigen (e.g., MOSPD2 such as human MOSPD2) bound to a solid surface or cells bearing either of these, an unlabeled test immunoglobulin and a labeled reference immunoglobulin. Competitive inhibition can be measured by determining the amount of label bound to the solid surface or cells in the presence of the test immunoglobulin. Usually the test immunoglobulin is present in excess. Usually, when a competing antibody is present in excess, it will inhibit specific binding of a reference antibody to a common antigen by at least 50-55%, 55-60%, 60-65%, 65-70% 70-75% or more. A competition binding assay can be configured in a large number of different formats using either labeled antigen or labeled antibody. In a common version of this assay, the antigen is immobilized on a 96-well plate. The ability of unlabeled antibodies to block the binding of labeled antibodies to the antigen is then measured using radioactive or enzyme labels.

BIAcore assays are conducted in HBS-EP running buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% v/v polysorbate P20). MOSPD2 surfaces are prepared by diluting the N-biotinylated MOSPD2 to a concentration of less than 0.001 mg/mL into HBS-EP buffer and injecting it across the SA sensor chip using variable contact times. Low capacity surfaces, corresponding to capture levels &lt;50 response units (RU) are used for high-resolution kinetic studies, whereas high capacity surfaces (about 800 RU of captured MOSPD2) are used for concentration studies, screening, and solution affinity determinations.</p><p id=\"p-0362\" num=\"0377\">Kinetic data is obtained by diluting antibody G1 Fab serially in two- or three-fold increments to concentrations spanning 1 \u03bcM-0.1 nM (aimed at 0.1-10 times estimated K<sub>D</sub>). Samples are typically injected for 1 minute at 100 \u03bcL/min and dissociation times of at least 10 minutes are allowed. After each binding cycle, surfaces are regenerated with 25 mM NaOH in 25% v/v ethanol, which is tolerated over hundreds of cycles. An entire titration series (typically generated in duplicate) is fit globally to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model using the BIAevaluation program. This returns a unique pair of association and dissociation kinetic rate constants (respectively, K<sub>on </sub>and K<sub>off</sub>) for each binding interaction, whose ratio gives the equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>=K<sub>off</sub>/K<sub>on</sub>).</p><p id=\"p-0363\" num=\"0378\">Anti-MOSPD2 antibodies may bind to one or more of the following amino acid regions of human MOSPD2, numbered according to SEQ ID NO:1 (amino acid residues 1-518): 508-517, 501-514, 233-241, 509-517, 212-221, 13-24, 505-517, 505-514, 89-100, 506-517, 233-245, 504-514, 128-136, 218-226, 15-24, 83-96, 42-50, 462-474, 340-351, 504-517, 462-470, 327-337, 21-32, 217-226, 510-517, 178-190, 497-509, 504-516, 64-77, 504-515, 147-159, 503-315, 88-97, 208-218, 178-191, 502-515, 503-516, 497-505, 500-509, 189-202, 189-197, 505-516, 1-63, 82-239, 93-234, 327-445, 327-431, and 497-517.</p><heading id=\"h-0057\">Example 19</heading><heading id=\"h-0058\">Additional Anti-MOSPD2 Antibodies</heading><p id=\"p-0364\" num=\"0379\">Additional anti-MOSPD2 antibodies are generated that recognize one or more MOSPD2 epitopes, following the methodology described in Example 1 (polyclonal antibodies) or Example 8 (monoclonal antibodies).</p><p id=\"p-0365\" num=\"0380\">Briefly, portions of MOSPD2 identified in Example 18 as MOSPD2 epitopes are fused to human Fc and immobilized on a solid support.
