    "eoisomers) is known by the following names: DL-Proline, 5-oxo-(.+-.)-2-Pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid, (,+-.)- Pyroglutamic acid, 5-Oxo-DL-proline, DL-2-Pyrrolidinone-5-carboxylic acid, DL-2-Pyrrolidone- 5-carboxylic acid, DL-Pyroglutamate, DL-Pyroglutamic acid, DL-Pyrrolidonecarboxylic acid, and Oxoproline. The DL form is also commercially available from Ajinomoto under the tradenames Ajidew A 100 and Ajidew N 50 (Na-PCA).</p>\n  Some of the above-listed stereoisomers are commercially available from UCIB, France via Barnet Products Corp., New Jersey, Such compounds are sold under trade names like Cuivridone (Cu-PCA) and L-FER Pidolate (Fe-PCA), and Pidolidone.</p>\n  Organic Acid</p>\n  The respiratory tract compositions of the present invention comprise an organic acid that is suitable for use in combination with the pyroglutamic acid described hereinabove. It is believed that when the respiratory tract compositions comprise a combination of organic acid and pyroglutamic acid, a composition is created that is hostile to viruses known to contribute to cold and influenza-like symptoms.</p>\n  The organic acid suitable for use herein can be included in the respiratory tract compositions as an individual organic acid or as a combination of organic acids, provided that the total organic acid concentration ranges from about 0.01% to about 10%), preferably from about 0.05% to about 5%, more preferably from about 0.10% to about 2.5%, by weight of the composition. The organic acid has a dissociation constant (pKa) of from about 3.0 to about 5.5. \n\nIt has been shown that when the organic acid is combined with PCA, the respiratory tract compositions have an increased buffering capacity, providing a surface pH of the tissue treated in the nasal cavities or turbinates of from about 3.0 to about 5.5.</p>\n  Nonlimiting examples of an organic acid suitable for use herein include ascorbic acid, monocarboxylic acids, dicarboxylic acids, tricarboxylic acids, and mixtures thereof. Specific nonlimiting examples of suitable monocarboxylic, dicarboxylic, or tricarboxylic acids include salicylic, fumaric, benzoic, glutaric, lactic, citric, malonic, acetic, glycolic, malic, adipic, succinic, aspartic, phthalic, tartaric, glutamic, gluconic, and mixtures thereof. It has been found that these organic acids can be incorporated into the respiratory tract compositions of the present invention at the defined concentrations to create a hostile environment for viruses without significantly irritating specific areas of the respiratory tract such as the nasal tissues, notwithstanding that organic acids have been known to be potential irritants to respiratory tract tissues.</p>\n  Although the organic acid is effective when used in combination with pyroglutamic acid, it has been found that combinations of the organic acid and metal compounds are also effective in the prevention and treatment of cold and influenza-like symptoms. Combinations of the organic acid and metal compound can be"
