    "in TNF-a in the WT groups (Figure 2A). Myocardial levels of TNF-a in the TAC1 <sup>-/-</sup> fistula were \n\n significantly lower than the WT fistula. Overall, TAC1<sup>-/-</sup> mice had lower levels of TNF-a. </p> Myocardial MMP activity: MMP activity (arbitrary units) was significantly increased in the WT fistula group when compared with WT sham group (Figure 2B). The TACl<sup>-/-</sup> fistula group was not significantly different from the TAC1<sup>-/-</sup> sham. </p> TUNEL assay: TU EL staining was used to identify dying cells in the myocardium. There were no significant differences between both fistula groups and their respective controls (Figure 2C). Both the TAC1<sup>-/-</sup> sham and fistula groups had more TU EL<sup>+</sup> cells/mm<sup>2</sup> than the WT fistula group. </p> Collagen volume fraction: Collagen volume fraction was significantly decreased at 28 days post-fistula in WT fistula mice when compared with the WT sham (Figure 3A and B). This decrease in collagen volume fraction did not occur in the TAC1<sup>-/-</sup> fistula animals compared with the TAC1<sup>-/-</sup> shams. </p> Degranulation of cardiac mast cells: The ability of substance P and NKA to induce cardiac mast cell degranulation was examined using isolated cardiac mast cells. The concentration-response curves for histamine release are displayed in Figure 4A. Substance P elicited a strong concentration-dependent secretagogue effect with the maximum per cent of histamine released being 64 \u00b1 4% (EC50 -log 4.4). In contrast, cardiac mast cells released essentially no histamine in response to NKA. Pre-treatment with the selective NK-1 receptor antagonist, L 732 138 prior to stimulation with substance P prevented the release of histamine (Figure 4B). Pre- treatment with the selective NK-2 receptor antagonist, GR 159 897 had no effect. Neither L 732 138 or GR 159 897 had any effect on histamine release when administered alone (data not shown). </p> Substance P-induced release of TNF-q from isolated cardiac inflammatory cells: A mixed population of isolated cardiac inflammatory cells containing T cells, mast cells, and macrophages was stimulated with substance P (100 \u03bc\u039c) to investigate the ability of substance P to induce TNF-a release. Substance P was found to significantly increase TNF-a production (Figure 4C). </p> Effect of NK-1 receptor antagonism on short-term myocardial remodelling, cardiac mast cell density and myocardial TNF-q in rats: The importance of the NK-1 receptor in the initial phase of volume overload-induced adverse myocardial remodelling, when mast cell density is at its greatest, was investigated using the \n\n fistula model. At 3 days post-fistula there were no changes in body, RV or lung weight (Table 2). However, LV weight was increased in the untreated and treated fistula groups. No biometric parameters were affected by treatment with L 732 138 in any group. In untreated fistula rats at 3 days post-fistula, there was a characteristic decrease in col"
