A protein molecule that can specifically bind to two target antigens or target antigen epitopes is named as bispecific protein molecule, including antibodies or antigen-binding fragments of the antibodies (such as single-chain antibodies). \u201cBispecific protein molecule\u201d is interchangeable with \u201cbispecific antibody\u201d herein.</p>The term \u201cbinding region\u201d for an antigen refers to a region or part that can specifically bind to an antigen in a multispecific protein molecule or antibody molecule. The antigen-binding region can be a ligand binding domain that can directly bind to the antigen, or can be a domain comprising a variable region of the antibody that can directly bind to the antigen.</p>The term \u201cantibody (Ab)\u201d includes any antigen binding molecule or molecular complex that includes at least one complementarity determining region (CDR) that specifically binds to or interacts with a specific antigen (e.g., CD3). The term \u201cantibody\u201d includes: four polypeptide chains connected to each other via disulfide bond(s), immunoglobulin molecules comprising two heavy (H) chains and two light (L",

Human CD3-\u03b5 (hCD3\u03b5) comprises amino acid sequence described in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P07766.2. Human CD3-\u03b4 (hCD3\u03b4) comprises amino acid sequence described in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P04234.1. Therefore, the term \u201cCD3\u201d refers to human CD3, unless specifically indicating that it is from a non-human species, such as \u201cmurine CD3\u201d, \u201cmonkey CD3\u201d, etc.</p>\u201cEpitope\u201d or \u201cantigenic determinant\u201d refers to a site on an antigen to which an immunoglobulin or antibody specifically binds. Epitopes usually include at least 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15 consecutive or non-consecutive amino acids in a unique spatial conformation. See, for example, Epitope Mapping Protocols in Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol. 66, G. E. Morris, Ed. (1996).</p>The term \u201cspecifically bind to\u201d, \u201cselectively bind to\u201d, \u201cselective binding\u201d or \u201cspecific binding\u201d refers to the binding of an antibody to a predetermined epitope on an antigen. Typically, the antibody binds with an affinity (KD) of less than about 10<sup>\u22128</sup>M, for example, less than about 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>M, 10<sup>\u221210 </sup>M or 10<sup>\u221211 </sup>M or even less.</p>The term \u201caffinity\u201d refers to the strength of the interaction between an antibody and an antigen at a single epitope. Within each antigenic site, the variable region of the antibody \u201carm\u201d interacts with the antigen at multiple amino acid sites via weak non-covalent forces; the greater the interaction, the stronger the affinity. As used herein, the term \u201chigh affinity\u201d of an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof (e.g., Fab fragment) generally refers to an antibody or antigen-binding fragment with K<sub>D </sub>of 1E<sup>\u22129</sup>M or less (e.g., K<sub>D </sub>of 1E<sup>\u221210</sup>M or less, K<sub>D </sub>of 1E<sup>\u221211</sup>M or less, K<sub>D </sub>of 1E<sup>\u221212</sup>M or less, K<sub>D </sub>of 1E<sup>\u221213</sup>M or less, K<sub>D </sub>of E<sup>\u221214 </sup>M or less, etc.).</p>The term \u201cKD\u201d or \u201cK<sub>D</sub>\u201d refers to a dissociation equilibrium constant for particular antibody-antigen interaction. Typically, the antibody binds to an antigen with a dissociation equilibrium constant (KD) of less than about 1E<sup>\u22128</sup>M, for example, less than about 1E<sup>\u22129</sup>M, 1E<sup>\u221210</sup>M or 1E<sup>\u221211</sup>M or even less, for example, as determined by Surface Plasma Resonance (SPR) technology in Biacore instrument. The smaller the KD value, the greater the affinity is.</p>The term \u201cnucleic acid molecule\u201d refers to DNA molecules and RNA molecules. The nucleic acid molecule can be single-stranded or double-stranded, but preferably is double-stranded DNA. A nucleic acid is \u201coperably linked\u201d when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For instance, a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence.</p>The term \u201cvector\u201d means a construct capable of delivering one or more target genes or sequences, and preferably, expressing them in a host cell. Examples of vectors include, but are not limited to, viral vectors, naked DNA or RNA expression vectors, plasmids, cosmids or phage vectors, DNA or RNA expression vectors associated with cationic coagulants, DNA or RNA expression vectors encapsulated in liposomes, and certain eukaryotic cells such as producer cells.</p>Methods for producing and purifying antibodies and antigen-binding fragments are well known in the art, for example, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., chapters 5-8 and 15. For example, mice can be immunized with antigen or fragment thereof, and the resulting antibodies can then be renatured, purified, and sequenced for amino acid sequences by using conventional methods well known in the art. Antigen-binding fragments can also be prepared by conventional methods. The antibodies or antigen binding fragments of the present disclos",

Affinity of the Bispecific Antibodies to B7H3 and CD3 Detected by BIAcore AssayThe detection of antibody affinity to B7H3 and CD3 was performed in the form of capture antibody. BsAb was captured by CM5 biosensor chip (Cat. #BR-1005-30, GE) or Protein A (Cat. #29127556, GE) biosensor chip coupled with Anti-Human IgG Antibody (Cat. #BR-1008-39, Lot. #10260416, GE), and then each antigen flowed through the surface of the chip. The reaction signals were detected in real time with the Biacore T200 instrument to obtain the binding and dissociation curves. After the dissociation of each experimental cycle was completed, the chip was washed and regenerated with regeneration buffer Glycine1.5 (Cat #BR100354, GE) or 3 M MgCl<sub>2 </sub>(from Human antibody capture kit, Cat. #BR100839, GE). The data were fitted with the (1:1) Langmuir model using GE Biacore T200 Evaluation version 3.0 software, and the affinity values were obtained.</p>With the arrangement order unchanged, the affinity of the bispecific antibodies to CD3 was slightly changed, when the sequences of CD3 antibody VH varied. When HRH-6 and HRH-5 sequences were used, the affinity of the antibody to CD3 was the weakest, and the binding to CD3 was not detectable by Biacore.</p>TABLE 10Biacore assay results of the antigen-binding affinityof the bispecific antibodies with AFF3 structureBispecificantibodyCD3 VH involvedBIAcore KD(M)131HRH-14.07E\u221208113HRH-27.72E\u221208127HRH-39.72E\u221208154HRH-46.97E\u221208156HRH-6No binding155HRH-5No binding177HRH-71.62E\u221207</p>As an example, antibodies comprising HRH3 as the heavy chain variable region of the CD3 antigen-binding domain were selected for the assay. Among the selected antibodies, the test antibodies 118, 127 and 132 have an affinity to human B7H3 and human CD3 at levels of 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>and 10<sup>\u22128</sup>M, respectively, which are comparable to those of MGD009.

Determination of the Antibody Binding Ability at Cell LevelThe ability of bispecific antibodies to bind to cell surface antigens was detected by FACS method. A498 (ATCC, HTB-44), CT26/hB7H3 (a recombinant cell line over-expressing human B7H3 in mouse cell CT26, constructed in-house, CT26 was obtained from the Cell Bank of Chinese Academy of Sciences, TCM37) and Jurkat recombinant cell lines (Jurkat cells were obtained from ATCC, PTS-TIB-152; the recombinant cell line was obtained on the basis of Jurkat cells by over-expressing luciferase gene and inserting",
    " these antibodies, the 161, 162, 113 and 126 have a killing activity equivalent or slightly superior to that of MGD009. The arrangement order of the different structures has little effect on the tumor cell killing activity of the B7H3 bivalent bispecific antibodies.</p>TABLE 13Comparison of the structure of the different test antibodiesNameSecondof thepolypeptideAntibodystructureFirst polypeptide chainchain161AFF1-2VH<sub>B7H3</sub>-L1-VL<sub>B7H3</sub>-L2-VL<sub>B7H3</sub>-L5-VH<sub>CD3</sub>(HRH2)-L3-VL<sub>CD3</sub>-VH<sub>B7H3</sub>-L6-Fc2L4-Fc1162AFF2-2VH<sub>B7H3</sub>-L1-VL<sub>B7H3</sub>-L2-VL<sub>B7H3</sub>-L5-VL<sub>CD3</sub>-L3-VH<sub>CD3</sub>(HRH2)-VH<sub>B7H3</sub>-L6-Fc2L4-Fcl113AFF3-2VL<sub>B7H3</sub>-L1-VH<sub>B7H3</sub>-L2-VL<sub>B7H3</sub>-L5-VH<sub>CD3</sub>(HRH2)-L3-VL<sub>CD3</sub>-VH<sub>B7H3</sub>-L6-Fc2L4-Fc1126AFF6-2VH<sub>CD3</sub>(HRH2)-L1-VL<sub>CD3</sub>-VL<sub>B7H3</sub>-L5-L2-VL<sub>B7H3</sub>-L3-VH<sub>B7H3</sub>-VH<sub>B7H3</sub>-L6-Fc2L4-FC1143AFF3-2BVL<sub>B7H3</sub>-L1-VH<sub>B7H3</sub>-L2-VH<sub>B7H3</sub>-L5-VH<sub>CD3</sub>(HRH2)-L3-VL<sub>CD3</sub>-VL<sub>B7H3</sub>-L6-Fc2L4-Fc1</p>3.4 Bispecific Antibodies have Killing Effects on Tumor Cell Lines with Different Expression Levels of B7H3</p>The three test bispecific antibodies 118, 127 and 132 were tested for the in vitro killing effects on A498, U87 and Detroit562 tumor cell lines. The killing effect is positively correlated with the expression level of B7H3. For example, the 118 has EC50 of 0.34, 2.4 and 14.5 nM for A498, U87 and Detroit562, respectively. All the three antibody molecules show this tendency. None of the bispecific antibodies have killing effect on the B7H3-negative control cell line CHOK1, and the negative control bispecific antibody NC1 did not have killing effect on any of the target cell lines. Together, these two aspects indicate that the cell killing is a target-specific killing, which requires redirecting the effector cells towards the B7H3 positive target cells by the bispecific antibodies.</p>TABLE 14Redirection of PBMCs mediated by the test bispecific antibodiestowards killing of different target cell lines118127132NC1B7H3IC50EmaxIC50EmaxIC50EmaxIC50EmaxCell lineexpresion(nM)(%)(nM)(%)(nM)(%)(nM)(%)A498high0.3465.92.467.52.9466.4&gt;30020.9U87intermediate2.467.28.269.511.967.6&gt;3003.8Detroit562low14.539.2415.826.4615.715.23&gt;3000.95CHOK1Negative&gt;3001.83&gt;3003.91&gt;3000.00&gt;3000.81</p>3.5 Comparison of the Killing Effects of Bispecific Antibodies with Different Structures on A498 Cells</p>The three test bispecific antibodies 127, 201 and 202 were tested for the in vitro killing effects on A498 tumor cell lines.

In 3 out of the 5 animals, the tumor volumes were regressed compared to those on the day of grouping, and the tumor volumes in the other 2 animals were completely regressed.</p>The anti-tumor activity of antibody 127 was repeated in another experiment (FIG. 10E). The tumor inhibition rate reached 90.6% on day 14 (p&lt;0.001), and it is increased to 95.80% on day 17 (p&lt;0.001). 127 was still effective at lower dose (0.12 mpk) and at lower administration frequency (once a week, 127-0.36 mpk-qw), with the tumor inhibition rates on day 17 reached 51.37% (p&lt;0.001) and 96.20% (p&lt;0.001) respectively.</p>Test Example 7.
