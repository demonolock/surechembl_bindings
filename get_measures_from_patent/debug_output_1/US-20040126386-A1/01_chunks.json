    "stocytoma cell lines and express high levels of H2-K<sup>d</sup>. P815:273 express the human p53 allele mutated at amino acid 273. </p>[0019]FIG. 8: [<sup>51</sup>Cr]-release assay on lymphocytes isolated from mice which were injected with 10<sup>6 </sup>(10)3-273.1 cells (b,c,e-j) or normal mice (a,d). Either (10)3 cells (open circles) or (10)3-273.1 cells (closed circles) were used as target cells. Displayed is percent lysis at a given effector to target ratio (E:T). Each point represents the average 3 to 4 measurements. Spontaneous lysis was less than 20% of maximal lysis. </p>[0020]FIG. 9: Kaplan-Meier-Plot of percent tumor-free transgenic mice ( . . . ; total n=19) or non-transgenic littermates (-; total n=22) over time. Shown are 3 separate experiments in which matched siblings were injected s.c. with 106 (10)3-273.1 cells per mouse. The combined stratified Wilcox-Sum-Rank-test is p=0.001. </p>[0021]FIG. 10: Immunoblot analysis of p53 protein expressed in BCG bacteria. Bacteria were lysed in cytoplasmic lysis buffer. One mg of protein extract was analyzed in each experimental lane of this SDS-PAGE. The protein was transferred to nitrocellulose, incubated with antibody pab421 and peroxidase conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:5000, Cappel), and developed with ECL (Amersham). </p>[0022] One-hundred ng human p53 protein purified from baculovirus extract was used as a positive control. Two out of two clones of wild-type and mutant p53 exon 5-11 express the respective 28 kD fragment. The upper bands might represent aggregates and are present at {fraction (1/10)} the level of the specific expression product. One clone (lane 2) of the full-length p53 expression constructs expresses p53. </p>[0023]FIG. 11: Immunoprecipitation and subsequent Western analysis of recombinant human full-length p53 expressed in BCG bacteria. Bacteria were lysed in lysis buffer and 1 mg extract was immunoprecipitated using either pab421, pab1801 or a control antibody pab419. The immunoprecipitable material was subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis, transferred to nitrocellulose and detected with polyclonal rabbit anti-p53 antiserum (1:500 dilubon) and visualized with peroxidase conjugated anti-rabbit-IgG (Cappel, 1:5000 dilution) and ECL (Amersham). BCG-SN<sub>3 </sub>expressed p53 under control of the BCG hsp60 promoter. p53 was immunoprecipitable by pabl801 directed against an N-terminal epitope and pab421 directed against a C-terminal epitope. Heat-shock of the bacteria did not increase the expression level. Untransformed BCG bacteria did not express p53. The secondary anti-rabbit-IgG had cross-reactivity to the IgG heavy and light chains of the monoclonal antibodies. More p53 was immunoprecipitated with pab421, which is the p53 antibody with the highest binding constant to p53 and which recognizes native and also denatured protein. </p>[0024]FIG. 12: Kaplan-Meyer plot of percent tumor-fee animals over time in days. Animals which did not develop progressive tumors were considered tumor-free. Graph A compares animals immunized with BCG expressing truncated (containing exons 5-11) wild-type (n=5) or mutant p53 (n=10) to mock, i.e. untreated, animals (n=5) challenged at the same time. Graph B compares animals immunized with BCG bacteria alone (n=10) to untreated animals (n=10). </p>[0025]FIG. 13: Graph of changes in tumor size, i.e. diameter over time in days. Graph A compares untreated animals (n=5) to mice immunized with BCG expressing truncated (containing exons 5-11) wild-type p53 (n=5). None of the latter developed tumors. Graph B shows animals immunized with BCG expressing truncated (containing exons 5-11) mutant p53. Two animals developed progressively growing tumors. Graph C shows animals immunized with BCG expressing full-length wild-type p53. All animals developed lesions, but the lesions did not grow. </p>[0026]FIG. 14: Immunization with ALVAC virus. Shown on the vertical axis is the time in days until the mice immunized with the respective vaccine (on the horizontal axis) developed tumors. Open circles represent individual mice, open squares the mean tumor-free survival time within each group\u00b1standard deviation. The lower p-values show the significance as calculated using a Mann-Whitney U Test between each subgroup a"
