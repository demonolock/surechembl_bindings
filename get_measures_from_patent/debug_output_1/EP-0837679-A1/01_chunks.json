    "</sub> receptor. The binding affinity of the compounds of the invention to the H<sub>3</sub> receptor may be demonstrated by the procedure described below: \n\n In Vitro Histamine H, Receptor Binding Analysis.</p>\n  Histamine H<sub>3</sub> receptor affinity was determined in rat cortical membranes using the</p>\n  H<sub>3</sub> selective agonist iigand, [<sup>3</sup>H]-N<sup>\u03b1</sup>-methylhistamine (78.9 Ci/mmole, DuPont NEN Research Products, Boston, MA) according to the method of West et al., (1 990) Mol.</p>\n  Pharmacol. 3_8: 610-613 with modifications. Briefly, animals were sacrificed by decapitation and the cerebral cortex was rapidly removed. Rat cortices were mechanically homogenized with an Omni 1000 motor driven homogenizer in 10 volumes (wt/voi) of Krebs-Ringers Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) containing the following protease inhibitors; EDTA (10 mM), PMSF (0.1 mM), chymostatin (0.2 mg/50mL) and leupeptin (0.2 mg/50m L) .</p>\n  The homogenate was centrifuged in a Sorvall at -40,000 x g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended by mechanical homogenization in 25 mL water and lysed on ice for 30 min. The homogenate was recentrifuged and the membrane lysis was repeated. The membranes were recentrifuged and the final pellet was resuspended in 14 volumes of water to give approximately 200 \u03bcg protein/100 \u03bcl final concentration. The suspension was stored at -</p>\n  80\u00b0C prior to use. Protein concentrations were determined by Coomassie Plus Protein Assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL).</p>\n  The binding assay was carried out in polypropylene tubes in a total volume of 0.4 mi of 50 mM Na<sup>+</sup> Phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), containing 1 50-200 \u03bcg of tissue protein,</p>\n  0.8-1 .2 nM [<sup>3</sup>H]-N<sup>\u03b1</sup>-methylhistamine and 0.3 to 10,000 nM GT-2016. Nonspecific binding (NSB) was accounted for by the inclusion of thioperamide (10 \u03bcM). Samples were incubated for 40 minutes at 25\u00b0C. The samples were filtered through glass fiber strips , pre-washed with 0.3% polyethyleneimine, using a Brandell cell harvester. The f ilters were rapidly washed three times with 4 ml of 25 mm Tris buffer containing 145 mM NaCl</p>\n  (pH 7.4, 4\u00b0C). Filters were transferred to polyethylene minivials and counted in 3.5 m l of scintillation fluid (Ecolume, ICN Biomedicals, Inc.). Using this procedure, the non\u00ac specific binding was less than 10% of the total binding and the binding to the glass fiber filters was negligible. Saturation and competition experiments were analyzed with the ReceptorFit saturation and competition curve fittingprograms (Lundon Software, Inc.,</p>\n  Cleveland, OH). K's were determined using the equation K = I C<sub>50</sub>/(1 + ([Ligand]/[K<sub>d</sub>]) .</p>\n  The results are given in Table 1. \n-->\n \n\n</p>\n  Histamine H<sub>3</sub> Receptor Binding Affinities</p>\n  Compound Structure H<sub>3</sub> Receptor K<sub>t</sub></p>\n  (nMI</p>\n  \n    \n  </p>\n  Example 1 53 +2</p>\n  \n    \n  </p>\n  Example 2 37 +4</p>\n  Example 2a\n\n</p>\n  23 +1</p>\n  Example 2b \n\n</p>\n  "
