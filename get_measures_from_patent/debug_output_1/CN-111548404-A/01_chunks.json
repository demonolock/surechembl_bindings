    "es expressed on the surface of a suitable antigen-presenting cell or artificial antigen-presenting cell by binding to a sufficient amount of antigen containing the antigen-presenting cell, or the antigen is loaded into class I or II MHC tetramer/class I or II MHC complex monomer by tetramerization. The \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains of \u03b1/\u03b2 TCRs and the \u03b3 and chains of \u03b3/TCRs are generally considered to have two \"domains\" each, namely variable and constant domains. The variable domain consists of a combination of a variable region (V) and a linking region (J). The variable domain may also comprise a leader region (L). Beta and the strand may also comprise a diversity region (D). The alpha and beta constant domains may also include a C-terminal Transmembrane (TM) domain that anchors the alpha and beta chains to the cell membrane.</p>The term \"TCR \u03b3 variable domain\" as used herein refers to the combination of TCR \u03b3 v (trgv) regions without leader region (L) and TCR \u03b3 (TRGJ) regions, and the term TCR \u03b3 constant domain refers to extracellular TRGC regions, or C-terminally truncated TRGC sequences, relative to the TCR of \u03b3/. Similarly, the term \"TCR variable domain\" refers to the combination of a TCRV (TRDV) region without a leader (L) and a TCRD/J (TRDD/TRDJ) region, and the term \"TCR constant domain\" refers to an extracellular TRDC region, or a C-terminally truncated TRDC sequence.</p>The TCRs of the present disclosure preferably bind to a peptide HLA molecule complex having a binding affinity (KD) of about 100 \u03bc \u039c or less, about 50 \u03bc \u039c or less, about 25 \u03bc \u039c or less or about 10 \u03bc \u039c or less. More preferred are high affinity TCRs having a binding affinity of about 1 \u03bc M or less, about 100nM or less, about 50nM or less, or about 25nM or less. Non-limiting examples of preferred binding affinity ranges for the inventive TCR include from about 1nM to about 10 nM; about 10nM to about 20 nM; about 20nM to about 30 nM; about 30nM to about 40 nM; about 40nM to about 50 nM; about 50nM to about 60 nM; about 60nM to about 70 nM; about 70nM to about 80 nM; about 80nM to about 90 nM; and about 90nM to about 100 nM.</p>In connection with the TCRs of the present specification, \"specific binding\" and grammatical variants thereof are used herein to refer to TCRs having a binding affinity (KD) for a peptide-HLA molecule complex of 100 \u03bc M or less.</p>The \u03b1/\u03b2 heterodimeric TCRs of the present specification may have an introduced disulfide bond between their constant domains. Preferred TCRs of this type include those having a TRAC constant domain sequence and a TRBC1 or TRBC2 constant domain sequence, unless threonine 48 of TRAC and serine 57 of TRBC1 or TRBC2 are substituted with cysteine residues which form a disulfide bond between the TRAC constant domain sequence and the TRBC1 or TRBC2 constant region sequence of the TCR.</p>The \u03b1/\u03b2 heterodimeric TCRs of the present specification, with or without the introduction of interchain linkages as described above, may have a TRAC constant domain sequence and a TRBC1 or TRBC2 constant domain sequence, and the TRAC constant domain sequence and the TRBC1 or TRBC2 constant domain sequence of the TCR may be linked through the native disulfide bond between Cys4 of TRAC exon 2 and Cys4 of TRBC1 or TRBC2 exon 2.</p>The TCRs of the present disclosure may include a detectable label selected from the group consisting of a radionuclide, a fluorophore, and a biotin. The TCRs of the present disclosure may be conjugated to a therapeutically active agent, such as a radionuclide, chemotherapeutic agent, or toxin.</p>In one embodiment, a TCR having at least one mutation in the alpha chain and/or having at least one mutation in the beta chain has modified glycosylation compared to the non-mutated TCR.</p>In one embodiment, a TCR comprising at least one mutation in the TCR \u03b1 chain and/or the TCR \u03b2 chain has a binding affinity and/or binding half-life for the peptide HLA molecule complex that is at least twice the binding affinity of a TCR comprising an unmutated TCR \u03b1 chain and/or an unmutated TCR \u03b2 chain. Tumor-specific TCR affinity enhancement and its development rely on the window where the optimal TCR affinity exists. The presence of such windows is based on observations: HLA-A2-restricted pathogen-specific TCRs generally have KD values approximately 10-fold lower than HLA-A2-restricted tumor-associated autoantigen-specific TCRs. It is now known that, although tumor antigens may be immunogenic, because tumors are derived from the individual's own cells, only mutant proteins or proteins with altered translational processing will be considered foreign by the immune system. Antigens that are up-regulated or overexpressed (so-called autoantigens) do not necessarily induce a functional immune response against the tumor: t cells expressing TCRs that are highly reactive against these antigens are selected against the thymus in a procedure called central tolerance, i.e. only cells with low affinity TCRs for self-antigens remain. Thus, the affinity of the TCRs or variants of the disclosure for a peptide can be enhanced by methods well known in the art.</p>The present specification also relates to a method of identifying and isolating a TCR of the present invention, the method comprising: PBMCs were incubated with a 2/peptide monomer from HLA-a \u00d7 02 negative healthy donors, PBMCs were incubated with tetramer-Phycoerythrin (PE) and high affinity T cells were isolated by fluorescence-initiated cell sorting (FACS) -Calibur method analysis.</p>The present specification also relates to a method of identifying and isolating a TCR of the present invention, the method comprising: transgenic mice containing the entire human TCR \u03b1 \u03b2 gene locus (1.1and 0.7Mb) were obtained (T cells expressing diversified human TCRs to ",
    "ne can be readily \"off-the-shelf\" for use in a larger patient population. This means that patients pre-selected for vaccine treatment can be restricted to HLA typing without any additional biomarker assessment of antigen expression, but still ensure that multiple targets are simultaneously challenged by an induced immune response, which is important for therapeutic efficacy (Banchereau et al, 2001; Walter et al, 2012).</p>The term \"scaffold\" as used herein refers to a molecule that specifically binds to a (e.g. antigenic) determinant. In one embodiment, the scaffold is capable of directing the entity (e.g., the (second) antigen-binding moiety) to which it is attached to a target of interest, e.g., to a specific type of tumor cell or tumor substrate bearing an antigenic determinant (e.g., a complex of a peptide and MHC according to the present application). In another embodiment, the scaffold is capable of initiating a signaling pathway through its target antigen (e.g., a T cell receptor complex antigen). Scaffolds include, but are not limited to, antibodies and fragments thereof, antigen-binding regions of antibodies comprising antibody heavy chain variable regions and antibody light chain variable regions, bound proteins including at least one ankyrin repeat motif and Single Domain Antigen Binding (SDAB) molecules, aptamers, (soluble) TCRs, and (modified) cells, such as allogeneic or autologous T cells. To assess whether a certain molecule is a scaffold bound to a target, a binding assay can be performed.</p>By \"specific\" binding is meant that the scaffold binds better to the peptide-MHC complex of interest than to other native peptide-MHC complexes to the extent that a scaffold possessing an active molecule capable of killing cells bearing a particular target is not capable of killing another cell not bearing the particular target but presenting one or more other peptide-MHC complexes. If the cross-reactive peptide-MHC peptide is not native, i.e., not from the human HLA-polypeptide group, binding to other peptide-MHC complexes is not critical. Assays to assess target cell killing are well known in the art. They should be carried out with target cells (primary cells or cell lines) or cells loaded with peptides, which contain unaltered peptide-MHC presentation, in order to reach the level of native peptide-MHC.</p>Each scaffold may include a label that is detectable by a signal provided by determining the presence or absence of a label. For example, the scaffold may be labeled with a fluorescent dye or any other suitable cell labeling molecule. Such marker molecules are well known in the art. For example, fluorescent labeling with a fluorescent dye can provide visualization of the binding aptamer by fluorescence or laser scanning microscopy or flow cytometry.</p>Each scaffold can be conjugated to a second active molecule (e.g., IL-21, anti-CD 3, anti-CD 28).</p>For further information on polypeptide scaffolds, see, e.g., the background section of",
    "cell receptor selection, phage display may be used (us 2010/0113300, (likdy et al, 2012)). For the purpose of stabilizing the T cell receptor during phage display and when actually used as a drug, the alpha and beta chains can be linked via non-native disulfide bonds, other covalent bonds (single chain T cell receptors) or via a dimerization domain (Boulter et al, 2003; Card et al, 2004; Willcox et al, 1999). T cell receptors may be linked to toxins, drugs, cytokines (see US 2013/0115191), domain recruitment effector cells such as anti-CD 3 domains, etc., in order to perform specific functions on target cells. In addition, it may be expressed in T cells for adoptive transfer. Further information can be found in WO 2004/033685A 1and WO 2004/074322A 1. Combinations of stcrs are described in WO 2012/056407a 1. Further methods of preparation are disclosed in WO 2013/057586a 1.</p>In addition, the peptides and/or TCRs or antibodies or other binding molecules of the invention can be used to validate the pathologist's diagnosis of cancer on the basis of biopsy samples.</p>The antibodies or TCRs may also be used in vivo diagnostic assays. Generally, antibodies are labeled with radionuclides (e.g., 111In, 99Tc, 14C, 131I, 3H, 32P, or 35S) to localize tumors by immunoscintigraphy. In one embodiment, the antibody or fragment thereof binds to the extracellular domain of two or more protein targets selected from the group comprising the proteins described above and has an affinity value (Kd) of less than 1x10 \u03bc M.</p>Diagnostic antibodies can be labeled with probes suitable for detection by various imaging methods. Probe detection methods include, but are not limited to, fluorescence, light, confocal and electron microscopy methods; magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy techniques; fluoroscopy, computer tomography, and positron emission tomography. Suitable probes include, but are not limited to, fluorescein, rhodamine, eosin and other fluorophores, radioisotopes, gold, gadolinium and other rare earths, paramagnetic iron, fluorine-18 and other positron emitting radionuclides. In addition, the probe may be bifunctional or multifunctional, and detection may be performed using more than one of the methods described above. These antibodies can be labeled with the probes directly or indirectly. The linking of antibody probes, including covalent attachment of probes, fusion of probes into antibodies, and covalent attachment of chelating compounds to bind probes, among other methods well known in the art. For immunohistochemical methods, diseased tissue samples may be fresh or frozen or may be embedded in paraffin and fixed with preservatives such as formalin. The fixed or embedded sections include samples contacted with labeled primary and secondary antibodies, wherein the antibodies are used to detect in situ protein expression.</p>Another aspect of the invention includes a method for preparing activated T cells in vitro, comprising contacting T cells in vit",

The identity and purity of each peptide has been determined using mass spectrometry and RP-HPLC analysis. White to off-white peptides were obtained with &gt; 50% purity by lyophilization (trifluoroacetate). All TUMAPs are preferably administered as the trifluoroacetate or acetate salt, although other pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms are possible.</p>Example 5</p>MHC binding assay</p>The candidate peptides of the present invention based on T cell therapy were further tested for their MHC binding capacity (affinity). The individual peptide-MHC complexes are generated by UV-ligand exchange, wherein the UV-sensitive peptides are cleaved after UV irradiation and exchanged with the relevant peptide for analysis. Only candidate peptides that can effectively bind and stabilize a peptide-accepting MHC molecule can prevent dissociation of the MHC complex. To determine the yield of the exchange reaction, an ELISA assay based on the detection of the stable MHC complex light chain (. beta.2m) was performed. The assays were generally performed according to the method described by Rodenko et al (Rodenko et al, 2006).</p>96-well Maxisorp plates (NUNC) were coated overnight at 2ug/ml pronase in PBS at room temperature, washed 4-fold and blocked in 2% BSA with blocking buffer for 1 hour at 37 \u2103. The folded HLA-A02: 01/MLA-001 monomer is used as a standard substance and covers the range of 15-500 ng/ml. The peptide-MHC monomer of the uv exchange reaction was diluted 100-fold in blocking buffer. The samples were incubated at 37 \u2103 for 1 hour, washed four times, incubated at 37 \u2103 for 1 hour with 2ug/ml HRP conjugated anti-. beta.2m, washed again, and detected with NH2SO4 blocked TMB solution. The absorption was measured at 450 nm. Candidate peptides that exhibit high exchange yields (preferably greater than 50%, most preferably greater than 75%) are generally"
