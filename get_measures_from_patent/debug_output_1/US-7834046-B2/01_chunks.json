    "genized by Polytron Homogenizers in 10 volumes of ice-cold buffer A (50 mM Tris, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.5 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, 10% sucrose) with protease inhibitors. The homogenate was centrifuged for 15 minutes at 2,000\u00d7g at 4\u00b0 C. The resultant supernatant was centrifuged again for 30 minutes at 43,000\u00d7g at 4\u00b0 C. The final pellet was re-suspended in buffer A and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. The protein concentration of the purified membrane was determined by the Bradford method as described by the manual provided by Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, Calif.</p>During the receptor binding experiments, 0.2\u02dc8 \u03bcg of a membrane was incubated with 0.75 nM [<sup>3</sup>H]CP55,940 and a test compound in an incubation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EDTA, 0.3% BSA, pH 7.4). The non-specific binding was determined by using 1 \u03bcM of CP55,940. The mixture was incubated for 1.5 hours at 30\u00b0 C. in Multiscreen microplates (Millipore, Billerica, Mass.). At the completion of the incubation, the reaction was terminated by Manifold filtration and washed with ice-cold wash buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 0.25% BSA) four times. The radioactivity bound to the filters was measured by Topcount (Perkin Elmer Inc.). IC<sub>50 </sub>values were calculated based on the concentration of the test compound required to inhibit 50% of the binding of [<sup>3</sup>H]CP55,940.</p>The efficacy of each test compound was determined by DELFIA GTP-binding kit (Perkin Elmer Inc., Boston, Mass.). The DELFIA GTP-binding assay is a time-resolved fluorometric assay based on GDP-GTP exchange on G-protein subunits followed by activation of a G protein-coupled receptor by its agonists. Eu-GTP was used in this assay to allow monitoring of agonist-dependent activation of G-protein. Note that stimulation of CB1 receptor by CP55,940 leads to the replacement of GDP by GTP on the \u03b1-subunit of G-protein. The resultant GTP-G\u03b1 complex represents the activated form of G-protein. Eu-GTP, a non-hydrolysable analogue of GTP, can be used to quantify the amount of activated G-protein (Peltonen et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. (1998) 355:275).</p>Plasma membrane of human CB1-expressing HEK293 cells was re-suspended in an assay buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 100 \u03bcg/mL saponin, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 \u03bcM GDP, 0.5% BSA). An aliquot (4 \u03bcg protein/well) was added to each well of an AcroPlate (Pall Life Sciences, Ann Arbor, Mich.). After the addition of a test compound (various concentrations in 0.1% DMSO) and CP55,940 (20 nM in the assay buffer), the assay plate was incubated in the dark at 30\u00b0 C. with slow shaking for 60 minutes. Eu-GTP was added to each well and the plate was incubated for another 35 minutes at 30\u00b0 C. in the dark. The assay was terminated by washing the plate four times with a wash solution provided in the assay kit. Binding of the Eu-GTP was determined based on the fluorescence signal from a Victor 2 multi-label reader. The IC<sub>50 </sub>value (i.e., 50% inhibition of CP55,940-stim"
