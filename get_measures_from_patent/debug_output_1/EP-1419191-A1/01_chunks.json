    "PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF ACTIVATED POLYETHYLENE GLYCOLS</p>TITLE OF THE INVENTION</p>Process for the Rapid Preparation of Activated Polyethylene Glycols [PEG- (NPC)<sup>2</sup>].</p>FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a process for the rapid preparation of activated polyethylene glycols, or PEG(NPC)<sup>2</sup>s. More specifically, the present invention is concerned with a process for the preparation of activated PEGs involving shorter reaction times, lower reaction temperatures and allowing for the expeditious recovery of the activated PEGs by a simple extraction procedure. Additionally, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of activated PEGs wherein stoichiometric amounts of reagents are used. The invention further covers the activated PEGs produced by this rapid process and their use in a variety of pharmaceutical, medical, cosmetical and chemical applications.</p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a polymer having the structure H(O-CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>-)<sub>n</sub>OH. It is generally synthesized by the ring opening polymerization of ethylene oxide. While the polymer usually has a linear structure at molecular weights &lt; 10 kD, the higher molecular weight PEGs may have some degree of branching.<sup>1</sup> Polyethylene glycols of different molecular weights have previously been used in a number of applications, including to increase the solubility of drugs. During the last three decades, polyethylene glycol has been extensively investigated for delivery of various proteins via parenteral routes. Generally, PEGs have been most widely used for the delivery of both traditional drugs (small molecules) and proteins/enzymes in the treatment of cancer.</p>Several chemical procedures have been developed for the preparation of activated PEGs, which can then be used to react specifically with free amino \n\ngroups on an enzyme's surface, under mild aqueous conditions. PEGs have been successfully activated by reaction with 1 ,1-carbonyl-di-imidazole, cyanuric chloride, tresyl chloride, 2,4,5-trichlorophenyl chloroformate or 4-nitrophenyl chloroformate, various N-hydroxy-succinimide derivatives as well as by the Moffatt-Swern reaction.<sup>2\"10</sup> In most cases, the activating agent acts as a linker between the PEG and the enzyme or protein.</p>One of the major disadvantages encountered with the processes currently available involves the reaction temperatures at which the activation reactions are carried out. The most commonly used solvents are acetonitrile (CH<sub>3</sub>CN) and dichloromethane (CH<sub>2</sub>CI<sub>2</sub>), containing small volumes of a co-solvent, usually triethylamine (TEA).
