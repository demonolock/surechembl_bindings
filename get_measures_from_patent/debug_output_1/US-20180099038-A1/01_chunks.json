    "t\u201d are used interchangeably.</p>The term \u201chapten\u201d as used herein refers to a small molecule that elicits an immune response only when attached to a large carrier such as a protein.</p>The term \u201cinduce an immune response,\u201d as used herein, means inducing a physiological response of the subject's immune system to an immunizing composition. An immune response may include an innate immune response, an adaptive immune response, or both. A protective immune response confers immunological cellular memory upon the subject, with the effect that a secondary exposure to the same or a similar antigen is characterized by one or more of the following characteristics: shorter lag phase than the lag phase resulting from exposure to the selected antigen in the absence of prior exposure to the immunizing composition; production of antibody which continues for a longer period than production of antibody resulting from exposure to the selected antigen in the absence of prior exposure to the immunizing composition; a change in the type and quality of antibody produced in comparison to the type and quality of antibody produced upon exposure to the selected antigen in the absence of prior exposure to the immunizing composition; a shift in class response, with IgG antibodies appearing in higher concentrations and with greater persistence than IgM, than occurs in response to exposure to the selected antigen in the absence of prior exposure to the immunizing composition; an increased average affinity (binding constant) of the antibodies for the antigen in comparison with the average affinity of antibodies for the antigen resulting from exposure to the selected antigen in the absence of prior exposure to the immunizing composition; and/or other characteristics known in the art to characterize a secondary immune response.</p>The term \u201cmodal length\u201d as used herein means number of O polysaccharide repeat units. A \u201cshort modal length\u201d as used herein means a low number of repeat units (e.g., 1-15). An \u201cintermediate\u201d or \u201clong\u201d modal length as used herein means a moderate number of repeat units (e.g., 16-50). A \u201cvery long modal length\u201d as used herein means &gt;50 O-polysaccharide repeat units.</p>The term \u201cvaccine,\u201d as used herein, means any preparation of biological material containing an antigenic material that upon administration to a subject provides active acquired immunity to at least the pathogenic organism from which the antigenic material was derived. Vaccines can be delivered prophylactically or therapeutically. Conjugate vaccines are used when the antigenic material is poorly immunogenic on its own (such as, for example, polysaccharide antigens), and must be linked to an immunogenic (usually protein) carrier so that it can be recognized more effectively by the immune system. Such poorly immunogenic antigens are termed \u201chaptens.\u201d A \u201chapten,\u201d therefore, as used herein, is a small or poorly immunogenic molecule that generally elicits a strong immune response only when atta",
    "e embodiments, LPS is prepared according to methods of Darveau et al. J. Bacteriol., 155(2):831-838 (1983), or Westphal et al. Methods in Carbohydrate Chemistry. 5:83-91 (1965) which are incorporated by reference herein. LPS may be purified by a modification of the methods of Darveau et al., supra, followed by mild acid hydrolysis to remove lipid A.</p>In certain embodiments, core-O-polysaccharides purified from wild-type, modified, or attenuated Gram-negative bacterial strains including but limited to those described in Table 1 (e.g., Salmonella Typhimurium CVD 1925, Salmonella Paratyphi A CVD 1902, and Shigella flexneri CVD 1208S) that overexpress a Wzz family protein (e.g., wzzB) are provided for use as haptens in conjugate vaccines. In preferred embodiments, the core-O-polysaccharide chain is purified from the Gram-negative bacterial strain overexpressing wzz protein for use as a vaccine antigen either as a conjugate or complexed vaccine.</p>O-Polysaccharide PurificationPurification methods are known in the art that maximize recovery of O-polysaccharides are known in the art and are described in Kim, et al., \u201cPurification of O-specific polysaccharide from lipopolysaccharide produced by Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A,\u201d Vaccine. 2014 May 1; 32(21):2457-62. Epub 2014 Mar. 12. After fermentation, bacterial cells are concentrated and washed, the permeate containing the free LPS processed separately from the cells. The free LPS is then concentrated and washed on a 100 kD ultrafiltration membrane to remove low molecular weight impurities. The LPS is detoxified by separation of the lipid A from the O-polysaccharide using acid hydrolysis at 100\u00b0 C., the precipitated lipid A was removed by 0.2 m membrane filtration. Contaminants were then removed by acid precipitation in the presence of sodium deoxycholate. The O-polysaccharide was then concentrated and washed with 1M NaCl then water using a 10 kD ultrafiltration membrane then sterile filtered through a 0.2 m membrane filter. The cells were treated by acid hydrolysis at 100\u00b0 C., the remaining cells, cell debris and precipitate was removed by centrifugation. The filtrate is then treated in the same way as described above for the free LPS. O-polysaccharide chains purified from a Gram-negative bacterial strain overexpressing a wzz family protein for use as a vaccine antigen either as a conjugate or complexed vaccine are provided. In certain embodiments, the wzz family protein is wzzB.</p>Carrier ProteinsConjugate or complexed vaccines in certain embodiments may contain the core-O-polysaccharide hapten covalently linked or complexed to a carrier protein as described in Table 4, which is intended to be non-limiting. In preferred embodiments, the carrier protein is a flagellin molecule.</p>TABLE 4Representative Examples of Carrier ProteinsCarrier ProteinFlagellin AFlagellin BPhase 1 flagella proteinPhase 2 flagella proteinDiptheria toxin or toxoidGenetically detoxified Diphtheria toxins Cross-reacting material 197(CRM197)Tetanus toxin or toxoidPseudomonas exotoxin ACholera toxin or toxoidGroup A streptococcal toxinsPneumolysin of Streptococcus pnneumoniaePneumococcal surface protein A (PSPA) of Streptococcus pneumoniaeFlimantous haemagglutinin (FHA)FHA fragments of Bordetella pertussispili or pilins of Neisseria gonorrhoeaepili or pilins of Neisseria meningitidisouter membrane proteins of Neisseria meningitidis,outer memb"
