    "s, the singular form \"a\", \"an\", and \"the\" include plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. For example, the term \"a cell\" includes a plurality of cells, including mixtures thereof. </p>[0033] As used herein, the term \"animal\" refers to living multi-cellular vertebrate organisms, a category that includes, for example, mammals and birds. The term \"mammal\" includes both human and non-human mammals. </p>[0034] The terms \"subject,\" \"host,\" \"individual,\" and \"patient\" are as used interchangeably herein to refer to human and veterinary subjects, for example, humans, animals, non-human primates, dogs, cats, sheep, mice, horses, and cows. In some embodiments, the subject is a human. </p>[0035] As used herein, the term \"antibody\" collectively refers to immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin-like molecules including by way of example and without limitation, IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM, combinations thereof, and similar molecules produced during an immune response in any vertebrate, for example, in mammals such as humans, goats, rabbits and mice, as well as non-mammalian species, such as shark immunoglobulins. Unless specifically noted otherwise, the term \"antibody\" includes intact immunoglobulins and \"antibody fragments\" or \"antigen binding fragments\" that specifically bind to a molecule of interest (or a group of highly similar molecules of interest) to the substantial exclusion of binding to other molecules (for example, antibodies and antibody fragments that have a binding constant for the molecule of interest that is at least 1()<sup>3</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> greater, at least 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> greater or at least 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> greater than a binding constant for other molecules in a biological sample). The term \"antibody\" also includes genetically engineered forms such as chimeric antibodies (for example, humanized murine antibodies), heteroconjugate antibodies (such as, bispecific antibodies). See also, Pierce Catalog and Handbook, 1994-1995 (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, 111.); Kuby, J., Immunology, 3<sup>rd</sup> Ed., IV . i I. Freeman &amp; Co., New York, 1997. </p>[0036] In terms of antibody structure, an immunoglobulin has heavy (H) chains and light (L) chains interconnected by disulfide bonds. There are two types of light chain, lambda (\u03bb) and kappa (\u03ba). There are five main heavy chain classes (or isotypes) which determine the functional activity of an antibody molecule: IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA and IgE. Each heavy and \n\n light chain contains a constant region and a variable region, (the regions are also known as \"domains\"). In combination, the heavy and the light chain variable regions specifically bind the antigen. Light and heavy chain variable regions contain a \"framework\" region interrupted by three hypervariable regions, also called \"complementarity-determining regions\" or \"CDRs\". The extent of the framework region and CDRs have been defined (see, Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1991, which is hereby incorporated by reference). The Kabat database is now maintained online. The sequences of the framework regions of different light ",
    " region comprises, or alternatively consists essentially of, or yet further consists of a polypeptide with a consensus sequence selected from SEQ ID NOs.:12-15, or equivalents of each thereof. </p>[0130] In another aspect of the present technology, the isolated antibody includes one or more of the following characteristics: </p> (a) the light chain immunoglobulin variable domain sequence comprises one or more CDRs that are at least 85% identical to a CDR of a light chain variable domain of any of the disclosed light chain sequences; </p> (b) the heavy chain immunoglobulin variable domain sequence comprises one or more CDRs that are at least 85% identical to a CDR of a heavy chain variable domain of any of the disclosed heavy chain sequences; </p> (c) the light chain immunoglobulin variable domain sequence is at least 85% identical to a light chain variable domain of any of the disclosed light chain sequences; </p> (d) the HC immunoglobulin variable domain sequence is at least 85% identical to a heavy chain variable domain of any of the disclosed light chain sequences; and </p> (e) the antibody binds an epitope that overlaps with an epitope bound by any of the disclosed sequences. </p>[0131] In one aspect, the present disclosure provides an isolated antibody that is at least 85% identical to the anti-LHR antibodies, e.g., 5F4-21, 4A7-4, 8B7-3 or 138-2, as disclosed herein. </p>[0132] In some of the aspects of the antibodies provided herein, the antibody binds human LHR with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of less than 10<sup>-4</sup> M, 10<sup>-5</sup> M, 10<sup>-6</sup> M, 10<sup>-7</sup> M, 10<sup>-8</sup> M, 10<sup>-9</sup> M, 10<sup>-10</sup> M, 10<sup>-11</sup> M, or 10<sup>-12</sup> M. In some of the aspects of the antibodies provided herein, the antigen binding site specifically binds to human LHR. </p>[0133] In some of the aspects of the antibodies provided herein, the antibody is soluble Fab. </p>[0134] In some of the aspects of the antibodies provided herein, the HC and LC variable domain sequences are components of the same polypeptide chain. In some of the aspects of the antibodies provided herein, the HC and LC variable domain sequences are components of different polypeptide chains. \n\n [0135] In some of the aspects of the antibodies provided herein, the antibody is a full-length antibody. In other aspect, antigen binding fragments of the antibodies are provided. </p>[0136] In some of the aspects of the antibodies provided herein, the antibody is a monoclonal antibody. </p>[0137] In some of the aspects of the antibodies provided herein, the antibody is chimeric or humanized. </p>[0138] In some of the aspects of the antibodies provided herein, the antibody fragment is selected from the group consisting of Fab, F(ab)'2, Fab\u2019, scF<sub>v</sub>, and F<sub>v</sub>. </p>[0139] In other aspects, one or more amino acid residues in a CDR of the antibodies provided herein are substituted with another amino acid. The substitution may be <",
    "p>[0167] Antibody Modifications. The antibodies of the present disclosure may be </p>multimerized to increase the affinity for an antigen. The antibody to be multimerized may be one type of antibody or a plurality of antibodies which recognize a plurality of epitopes of the same antigen. As a method of multimerization of the antibody, binding of the IgG CH3 domain to two scF<sub>v</sub> molecules, binding to streptavidin, introduction of a helix-turn-helix motif and the like can be exemplified. </p>[0168] The antibody compositions disclosed herein may be in the form of a conjugate formed between any of these antibodies and another agent (immunoconjugate). In one aspect, the antibodies disclosed herein are conjugated to radioactive material. In another aspect, the antibodies disclosed herein can be bound to various types of molecules such as polyethylene glycol (PEG). </p>[0169] Antibody Screening. V arious immunoassays may be used for screening to identify antibodies having the desired specificity. Numerous protocols for competitive binding or immunoradiometric assays using either polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies with established specificities are well known in the art. Such immunoassays typically involve the </p>measurement of complex formation between LHR, or any fragment or oligopeptide thereof and its specifi c antibody. A two-site, monoclonal -based immunoassay utilizing monoclonal antibodies specific to two non-interfering LHR epitopes may be used, but a competitive binding assay may also be employed (Maddox et at, J. Exp. Med., 158: 121 1-1216 (1983)). </p>[0170] Automated immunohistochemistry (IHC) screening of potential anti-LHR antibodies can be performed using a Ventana Medical Systems, Inc (VMSI) Discovery XT and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human tissue on glass slides. Tissue samples first \n\n undergo deparaffinization, antigen retrieval, followed by the addition of the potential anti- LHR antibody and a detection antibody. The detection antibody is visualized using a chromogen detection reagent from VMSI. Stained slides are manually screened under a microscope. Samples having a correct primary antibody staining pattern are selected as potential anti-LHR candidates. </p>[0171] Antibody Purification. The antibodies disclosed herein can be purified to homogeneity. The separation and purification of the antibodies can be performed by employing conventional protein separation and purification methods. </p>[0172] By way of example only, the antibody can be separated and purified by </p>appropriately selecting and combining use of chromatography columns, filters, ultrafiltration, salt precipitation, dialysis, preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing electrophoresis, and the like.
