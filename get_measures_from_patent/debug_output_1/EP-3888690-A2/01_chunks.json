    "molecule of the invention contains an IgG constant domain, or FcRn-binding fragment thereof such as an Fc region or hinge-Fc region, having the sequence CSWHLC (mutant \"N3\"; SEQ ID NO:20) at residues 432-437.</p>Changes in binding affinity to FcRn at one or more different pHs were shown to affect the in vivo half-life of the IgG. The in vivo half-life, or persistence in serum or other tissues of a subject, of antibodies, and other therapeutic agents and other bioactive molecules is an important clinical parameter which determines the amount and frequency of antibody (or any other pharmaceutical molecule) administration. Accordingly, such molecules, including antibodies and agents coupled to an IgG constant domain or FcRn-binding fragment thereof, such as an Fc region or hinge-Fc region, with changes in half-life are of significant pharmaceutical importance.</p>In certain embodiments, the molecule of the invention includes an IgG constant domain, or FcRn-binding fragment thereof, such as an Fc region or hinge-Fc region, that has amino acid modifications (e.g., substitutions, insertions and/or deletions) that increase the affinity of the IgG constant domain, or FcRn-binding fragment thereof, for FcRn at pH 6, relative to a wild type molecule or fragment. For example, the molecule of the invention can include an IgG constant domain, or FcRn-binding fragment thereof, such as an Fc region or hinge-Fc region, that exhibits high affinity binding to FcRn at pH 6.0 characterized by a KD of less than about 500 nM. An IgG or other molecule containing a modified IgG constant domain or FcRn-binding fragment thereof (e.g., an Fc region or hinge-Fc region), may exhibit either longer or shorter in vivo half-life than a comparable unmodified molecule, such as wild-type molecule or fragment.</p>In certain embodiments, the molecule of the invention includes an IgG constant domain, or FcRn-binding fragment thereof, such as an Fc region or hinge-Fc region, has amino acid modifications (e.g., substitutions, insertions and/or deletions) that alter the binding affinity for FcRn at pH 7.4 relative to a wild type molecule or fragment. In one embodiment, for example, the molecule of the invention can include an IgG constant domain, or FcRn-binding fragment thereof, that exhibits binding affinity to FcRn at pH 7.4 characterized by a KD of less than \u223c1000 nM. In another embodiment, for example, the molecule of the invention can include an IgG constant domain, or FcRn-binding fragment thereof, that exhibits binding affinity to FcRn at pH 7.4 characterized by a KD of more than \u223c1000 nM. Optionally, the binding affinity of the molecule of the invention to FcRn at pH 7.4 is less than the binding affinity to FcRn at pH 7.4 of a wild type molecule or fragment.</p>In certain embodiments, the molecule of the invention includes an IgG constant domain, or FcRn-binding fragment thereof, such as an Fc region or hinge-Fc region, has amino acid modifications (e.g., substitutions, insertions and/or deletions) that increase binding affinity for FcRn at both pH 6.0 and pH 7.4, relative to a comparable unmodified molecule, such as a wild type molecule or fragment.</p>In one embodiment, the molecule of the invention includes an IgG constant domain, or FcRn-binding fragment thereof, such as an Fc region or hinge-Fc region, that exhibits binding affinity to FcRn at pH 6.0 characterized by a KD of less than about 500 nM, and a binding affinity to FcRn at pH 7.4 characterized by a KD of less than \u223c1000 nM. Optionally, a molecule of this embodiment of the invention may, but need not, possess \"abdeg-like\" properties as described in more detail below (see, e.g., Fig. 2A and 5B, quadrant III). A molecule of this embodiment may, but need not, exhibit a shorter in vivo half-life compared to an unmodified molecule, such as a molecule containing a wild type IgG constant domain or FcRn-binding fragment thereof.</p>In another embodiment, the molecule of the invention includes an IgG constant domain, or FcRn-binding fragment thereof, such as an Fc region or hinge-Fc region, that exhibits binding affinity to FcRn at pH 6.0 characterized by a KD of less than about 500 nM, and a binding affinity to FcRn at pH 7.4 characterized by a KD of more than \u223c1000 nM but less than the KD of a comparable wild-type molecule at pH 7.4. Optionally, a molecule of this embodiment of the invention may, but need not, possess \"YTE-like\" properties (see, e.g., Fig. 2A and 5B, quadrant I). A molecule of this embodiment may, but need not, exhibit a longer in vivo half-life compared to an unmodified molecule, such as a molecule containing a wild type IgG constant domain or FcRn-binding fragment thereof.</p>In one aspect, the present invention relates to IgGs and other molecules containing a modified Fc region or FcRn-binding fragment thereof (e.g., an Fc region or hinge-Fc region) whose in vivo half-lives are extended by modification of an IgG constant domain or FcRn-binding fragment thereof, such as an Fc region or hinge-Fc region. Increasing the half-life of therapeutic and diagnostic IgGs and other bioactive molecules using methods of the invention has many benefits including reducing the amount and/or frequency of dosing of these molecules, for example, in vaccines, passive immunotherapy and other therapeutic and prophylactic methods. In some embodiments, modified IgGs and other modified molecules of this aspect of the invention that exhibit longer in vivo half-lives are characterized by high affinity binding to FcRn at pH 6, and by a relatively low affinity binding to FcRn at pH 7.4, and optionally an increased pH dependence of binding to FcRn as compared to a wild type IgG. It is expected that the half-lives of these modified IgGs and other molecules can be furth",
    "ding chemical conjugation or recombinant means. An \"in-frame fusion\" or \"operably linked\" refers to the joining of two or more open reading frames (ORFs) to form a continuous longer ORF, in a manner that maintains the correct reading frame of the original ORFs. Thus, the resulting recombinant fusion protein is a single protein containing two or more segments that correspond to polypeptides encoded by the original ORFs (which segments are not normally so joined in nature). Although the reading frame is thus made continuous throughout the fused segments, the segments may be physically or spatially separated by, for example, an in-frame linker sequence.</p>The term \"FcRn receptor\" or \"FcRn\" as used herein refers to an Fc receptor (\"n\" indicates neonatal) which is known to be involved in transfer of maternal IgGs to a fetus through the human or primate placenta, or yolk sac (rabbits) and to a neonate from the colostrum through the small intestine. It is also known that FcRn is involved in the maintenance of constant serum IgG levels by binding the IgG molecules and recycling them into the serum. The binding of FcRn to naturally occurring IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 molecules is strictly pH-dependent with optimum binding at pH 6. IgG3 has a known variation at position 435 (i.e., human IgG has R435 instead of H435 found in human IgG1, IgG2 and IgG4), which may result in reduced binding at pH 6. FcRn comprises a heterodimer of two polypeptides, whose molecular weights are approximately 50 kD and 15 kD, respectively. The extracellular domains of the 50 kD polypeptide are related to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I \u03b1-chains and the 15 kD polypeptide was shown to be the non-polymorphic \u03b2<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin (\u03b2<sub>2</sub>-m). In addition to placenta and neonatal intestine, FcRn is also expressed in various tissues across species as well as various types of endothelial cell lines. It is also expressed in human adult vascular endothelium, muscle vasculature and hepatic sinusoids and it is suggested that the endothelial cells may be most responsible for the maintenance of serum IgG levels in humans and mice. The amino acid sequences of human FcRn and murine FcRn are indicated by SEQ ID NO:5 and SEQ ID NO:6, respectively. Homologs of these sequences having FcRn activity are also included.</p>An \"FcRn-binding fragment\" of an IgG constant domain, as that term is used herein, refers to a fragment of an IgG constant domain that binds to the FcRn receptor. An FcRn-binding fragment of an IgG constant domain can include the Fc region, or the hinge-Fc region; thus it can include portions of the heavy chain CH2-CH3 region or the hinge-CH2-CH3 region that are involved in binding to FcRn (see Roopenian et al., Nature Rev. Immunol. 7:715-725 (2007).</p>\"KD\" as that term is used herein (sometimes also referred to as Kd, K<sub>D</sub> or K<sub>d</sub>) is the equilibrium dissociation constant a binding interaction between two molecules, such as an IgG and FcRn. KD can be calculated from observed rate constants for association (k<sub>on</sub>) and dissociation (k<sub>off</sub> ), such that KD is equal to the ratio of the k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>.</p>The term \"in vivo half-life\" as used herein refers to a biological half-life of a particular type of IgG molecule or its fragments containing FcRn-binding sites in the circulation of a given animal and is represented by a time required for half the quantity administered in the animal to be cleared from the circulation and/or other tissues in the animal. When a clearance curve of a given IgG is constructed as a function of time, the curve is usually biphasic with a rapid \u03b1-phase which represents an equilibration of the injected IgG molecules between the intra- and extravascular space and which is, in part, determined by the size of molecules, and a longer \u03b2-phase which represents the catabolism of the IgG molecules in the intravascular space. The term \"in vivo half-life\" practically corresponds to the half-life of the IgG molecules in the \u03b2-phase.</p>An \"isolated\" or \"purified\" antibody or fusion protein is substantially free of cellular material or other contaminating proteins from the cell or tissue source from which the protein is derived, or substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. The language \"substantially free of cellular material\" includes preparations of an antibody or a fusion protein in which the antibody or the fusion protein is separated from cellular components of the cells from which it is isolated or recombinantly produced. Thus, an antibody or a",

The \"EU index as set forth in Kabat\" refers to the residue numbering of the human IgG1 EU antibody as described in Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th ed., 1991 NIH Pub. No. 91-3242. Figure 1A-B shows the amino acid sequences and numbering for the CH1 and hinge regions. Figure 1C shows the amino acid sequences and numbering for the CH2 region. Figure ID shows the amino acid sequence and numbering for the CH3 region. Residues which differ as between the IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and/or IgG4 are shaded, and sites of known allelic variation are indicated by an asterisk (*). Figure IE shows a human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) large subunit p51 amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO:5) which forms a complex with beta-2-microglobulin (also known as p14). Figure IF shows a representative human beta-2-microglobulin amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO:6). Due to known allelic variations, slight differences between the presented sequences and sequences in the prior art may exist.Figure 2A shows a two-dimensional space defined by binding affinity (KD values) of the IgG Fc fragment to the human FcRn (hFcRn) at pH 6.0 (x-axis) and pH 7.4 (y-axis). The plane is divided into quadrants that may be associated with varying pharmacokinetic properties. Figure 2B shows a scatter plot showing hFcRn binding for selected anti-CD20 variants at pH 6.0 and 7.4. Figure 2C displays a scatter plot of the inset box from Figure 2B showing hFcRn binding for selected anti-CD20 variants.Figure 3 shows differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis of HB20.3 IgG and various Fc variants. All antibodies exhibit a Fab unfolding temperature of \u223c73 \u00b0C. HB20.3 (black dashed line) has a C<sub>H</sub>3 T<sub>m</sub> of 83.3 \u00b0C; the denaturation transition for HB20.3 C<sub>H</sub>2 (normally \u223c69 \u00b0C) is likely buried within the Fab transition. YTE (dark grey line) has a C<sub>H</sub>3 T<sub>m</sub> of 83.3\u00b0C and a C<sub>H</sub>2 of 65.1 \u00b0C. N3-YTE (black line), and CwtC-YTE (light grey dashed line) exhibit similar C<sub>H</sub>2 and C<sub>H</sub>3 transitions, with the C<sub>H</sub>3 T<sub>m</sub> at 87.1\u00b0C for both variants and C<sub>H</sub>2 transition reduced to 62.7 \u00b0C for N3-YTE and 62.3 \u00b0C for CwtC-YTE. SerN3-YTE (light grey line) had the lowest C<sub>H</sub>2 transition of the antibodies shown at 58.7 \u00b0C, with its C<sub>H</sub>3 transition masked by the Fab unfolding at 73\u00b0C.Figure 4 shows sequence analysis for the CXXXXCE (SEQ ID NO:10) and ZXXHXZ (SEQ ID NO:14) libraries as graphic representations of the relative incidence of an amino acid to",
    "on relates to an IgG or other molecule (e.g., a protein or a non-protein agent) covalently linked to an IgG constant domain, or a fragment thereof that binds to FcRn (e.g., an Fc region or hinge-Fc region) (e.g., from a human IgG, e.g., human IgG1), that has a reduced in vivo half-life by virtue of the presence of a modified IgG constant domain, or FcRn-binding fragment thereof, wherein the IgG constant domain, or fragment thereof, is modified (e.g., by amino acid substitution, deletion or insertion) to alter the binding affinity of the IgG constant domain, or fragment thereof, for FcRn, at one or more pHs; for example, but not by way of limitation, by maintaining or increasing the binding affinity for FcRn, at pH 6.0 and concurrently increasing the binding affinity for FcRn at pH 7.4.</p>Most modified IgGs of the invention, whether they exhibit increased or decreased in vivo half-lives compared to each other or their unmodified or wild-type counterparts, contain an IgG constant domain, or FcRn-binding fragment thereof, that exhibits higher binding affinity toward FcRn at pH 6.0 than wild-type IgG constant domain.</p>More generally, one skilled in the art will understand that the Fc variants of the invention, whether they exhibit increased or decreased in vivo half-lives compared to each other or their unmodified or wild-type counterparts, may have altered FcRn binding properties. Examples of binding properties include but are not limited to, binding specificity, equilibrium dissociation constant (KD), dissociation and association rates (Kon, and Koff respectively), binding affinity and/or avidity. It is well known in the art that the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) is defined as k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>. It is understood that a higher affinity interaction will have a lower KD and conversely that a lower affinity interaction will have a higher KD. However, in some instances the value K<sub>on</sub> or K<sub>off</sub> may be more relevant than the value of the KD.</p>While the relationships among IgG binding affinity for FcRn, the pH dependence of such binding affinity, and in vivo half-life are complex, it has been discovered that, for those IgG constant domains that exhibit high affinity binding to FcRn at pH 6.0 (e.g., KDs of less than about 500 nM), as the binding affinity for FcRn at pH 7.4 increases (generally reflecting reduced pH dependence of FcRn binding), for example, if the KD at pH 7.4 falls below about 1 \u00b5M into the nanomolar ranged, the result can in some instances be a shorter in vivo half-life for the modified IgG (see, e.g., quadrant III in Fig. 2A and 5B, discussed in more detail below).</p>In contrast, reduced binding affinity for FcRn at pH 7.4 (e.g., KDs at pH 7.4 above about 1 \u00b5M) coupled with high binding affinity at pH 6.0 (e.g., KDs of less than about 500 nM), generally reflecting a greater pH dependence of FcRn binding, can in some instances result in a longer in vivo half-life (see, e.g., quadrant I in Fig. 2A and 5B, discussed in more detail below).</p>In some embodiments, modified IgGs and other molecules of the invention contain a modified IgG constant domain or FcRn-binding fragment thereof (e.g., an Fc region or hinge-Fc region), that exhibits a KD for binding to FcRn at pH 6.0 of less than 100nM, less than 200 nM, less than 300nM, less than 400 nM, less than 500nM or less than 1000nM. Modified IgGs of the invention can, for example, be characterized by KD values for FcRn binding at pH 6.0 of 10 nM to 500 nM, 50 nM to 500 nM. In some embodiments, the modified IgG of the invention exhibits at least a 10-fold enhancement, at least a 20 -fold enhancement, or at least a 50-fold enhancement of binding affinity for FcRn at pH 6.0 compared to a wild-type IgG constant domain, or FcRn-binding fragment thereof.</p>Additionally or alternatively, a modified IgG can exhibit a binding affinity for FcRn at pH 7.4 that is between 10 nM and 50 \u00b5M. Without intending to be bound by theory, it is observed that a threshold may exist: at pH 7.4, a KD of about 1\u00b5M or higher (e.g., a KD of 1\u00b5M, 5\u00b5M 10 \u00b5M, 20 \u00b5M, 30 \u00b5M, 40 \u00b5M, 50 \u00b5M, or higher; that is, binding affinities in the micromolar or millimolar range evidencing lower binding affinity for FcRn) may be associated with a modified IgG or other molecule having enhanced half-life (slower clearance), while a KD of less than 1 \u00b5M at pH 7.4 (e.g., a KD of 50 nM, 100nM, 200nM, 500nM, 800nM up to about 1000nM; that is, binding affinities in the nanomolar range, evidencing higher binding affinity for FcRn) may be associated with a modified IgG or other molecule having a shortened half-life (faster clearance). An increased half-life for the modified IgG or other molecule is generally, but not always, associated with pH-dependent binding to FcRn characterized by a KD of 50 nM to 400 nM or 500 nM for binding at pH 6, and a KD of more than 1\u00b5M at pH 7.4.</p>Fig. 2A shows a coordinate plane defined by KD values for binding of IgG to FcRn at pH 6.0 (x-axis) and pH 7.4 (y-axis). Four quadrants are shown, but it should be understood that the quadrants may overlap with each other since the relationship between the pH dependence of FcRn binding and various pharmacokinetic properties, such as half-life and serum clearance, are complex.</p>IgGs that fall into quadrant I show high binding affinity for FcRn at pH 6.0 (higher than wild-type) and relatively low binding affinity at pH 7.4. The result is generally greater pH dependence of binding to FcRn, which may be associated with longer in vivo half-lives for these IgGs. Fig. 2B shows exemplary mutant IgGs that fall quadrant I. One such mutant is referred to herein as \"YTE.\" YTE has an IgG constant domain having mutations in the CH2 domain (i.e., M252Y/S254T/T256E). The YTE mutant has enhanced binding affinity for FcRn at pH 6.0 and relatively low binding affinity at 7.4, and exhibits a 3-4 fold increase in in vivo half-life and clearance, compared to a wild-type IgG constant domain. This mutation is among the best identified to extend IgG half-life and is described in more detail in US Pat. No. 7,083,784, issued Aug 1, 2006</patcit>, and PCT publication WO 2002/060919, published Aug 8, 2002</patcit>. Modified IgGs of the invention that fall in to quadrant I are therefore sometimes referred to herein as \"YTE-like\" or having \"YTE-like\" properties. Exemplary modified IgGs of the invention with \"YTE-like\" properties, whose structures ",
    "ain mutants based on the wild-type IgG1 constant domain base structure, i.e., N3, Y12 and Y31, were tested in motavizumab. It was found that the binding affinity of the IgG constant domain toward FcRn at pH 6.0 binding was largely the same as in the anti-CD20 IgG. The effect of the \"YTE\" base structure was also tested in motavizumab. The pharmacokinetic properties of Mota-Y12-YTE and Mota-Y31-YTE were compared with those of Mota-Y12-WT and Mota Y31-WT, respectively (motavizumab providing the variable domain). Enhanced binding affinity toward FcRn at pH 6.0 and pH dependency of binding affinity was observed, suggesting that YTE and the H435 loop region both affect pH dependency binding to FcRn. Serum clearance rates in a mouse model using motavizumab were also evaluated. Most of the IgGs evaluated were cleared from serum relatively slowly, thereby suggesting enhanced recycling via FcRn binding. However, IgG having the N3E-YTE mutation, which has much reduced pH dependency in its binding affinity for FcRn, was quickly cleared from serum. For many therapeutic applications, reduced (slower) serum clearance is beneficial, however for some therapeutic applications and many diagnostic applications, faster clearance is preferred, as described in more detail elsewhere herein. These data suggest that the binding affinity of the IgG constant domain for FcRn at pH 7.4 may be an important determinant in serum half-lives and clearance rates for IgGs. Tight binding to FcRn at pH 7.4 (e.g., KD of 25 nM) for N3E-YTE was associated with fast serum clearance rates. However, as the KD at pH 7.4 decreased below 1 uM at pH 7.4, the IgG began to exhibit enhanced half-life and slower clearance rates.</p>Amino acid modifications can be made by any method known in the art and many such methods are well known and routine for the skilled artisan. For example, but not by way of limitation, amino acid substitutions, deletions and insertions may be accomplished using any well-known PCR-based technique. Amino acid substitutions may be made by site-directed mutagenesis (see, for example, Zoller and Smith, Nucl. Acids Res. 10:6487-6500, 1982; Kunkel, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 82:488, 1985, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties). Mutants that result in increased affinity for FcRn and increased in vivo half-life may readily be screened using well-known and routine assays, such as those described herein. Amino acid substitutions can be introduced at one or more residues in the IgG constant domain or FcRn-binding fragment thereof (e.g., an Fc region or hinge-Fc region), and the mutated constant domains or fragments can be expressed on the surfaces of bacteriophage which are then screened for increased FcRn binding affinity.</p>Once generated, a mutated IgG constant domain, or fragment thereof (e.g., an Fc region or hinge-Fc region), may be used in the construction of an IgG (e.g., by fusing to the variable portions of an antibody of interest) or an Fc fusion molecule (e.g., by fusing/conjugating a heterologous moiety).

Further, those modifications in the constant domain or the fragment thereof which increase the affinity of the constant domain or fragment thereof for FcRn can be fused to bioactive molecules to increase the in vivo half-lives of said bioactive molecules and optionally alter (e.g., increase or decrease) the bioavailability of the molecule, for example, to increase or decrease transport to mucosal surfaces (or other target tissue) (e.g., the lungs).</p>MutagenesisMutagenesis may be performed in accordance with any of the techniques known in the art including, but not limited to, synthesizing an oligonucleotide having one or more modifications within the sequence of the constant domain of an antibody or a fragment thereof (e.g., the CH2 or CH3 domain) to be modified. Site-specific mutagenesis allows the production of mutants through the use of specific oligonucleotide sequences which encode the DNA sequence of the desired mutation, as well as a sufficient number of adjacent nucleotides, to provide a primer sequence of sufficient size and sequence complexity to form a stable duplex on bo",
    "t protocols see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York at 10.8.1.</p>ELISAs comprise preparing antigen, coating the well of a 96 well microtiter plate with the antigen, adding the antibody of interest conjugated to a detectable compound such as an enzymatic substrate (e.g., horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase) to the well and incubating for a period of time, and detecting the presence of the antigen. In ELISAs the antibody of interest does not have to be conjugated to a detectable compound; instead, a second antibody (which recognizes the antibody of interest) conjugated to a detectable compound may be added to the well. Further, instead of coating the well with the antigen, the antibody may be coated to the well. In this case, a second antibody conjugated to a detectable compound may be added following the addition of the antigen of interest to the coated well. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected as well as other variations of ELISAs known in the art. For further discussion regarding ELISAs see, e.g., Ausubel et al, eds, 1994, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York at 11.2.1.</p>The binding affinity of an antibody to an antigen and the off-rate of an antibody-antigen interaction can be determined by competitive binding assays. One example of a competitive binding assay is a radioimmunoassay comprising the incubation of labeled antigen (e.g., <sup>3</sup>H or <sup>125</sup>I) with the antibody of interest in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled antigen, and the detection of the antibody bound to the labeled antigen. The affinity of the antibody of the present invention or a fragment thereof for the antigen and the binding off-rates can be determined from the saturation data by scatchard analysis. Competition with a second antibody can also be determined using radioimmunoassays. In this case, the antigen is incubated with an antibody of the present invention or a fragment thereof conjugated to a labeled compound (e.g., <sup>3</sup>H or <sup>125</sup>I) in the presence of increasing amounts of an unlabeled second antibody.</p>In an embodiment, BIAcore kinetic analysis is used to determine the binding on and off rates of antibodies to an antigen. BIAcore kinetic analysis comprises analyzing the binding and dissociation of an antigen from chips with immobilized antibodies on their surface.</p>The antibodies of the invention as well as fusion proteins and conjugated molecules can also be assayed for their ability to inhibit the binding of an antigen to its host cell receptor using techniques known to those of skill in the art. For example, cells expressing the receptor for a viral antigen can be contacted with virus in the presence or absence of an antibody and the ability of the antibody to inhibit viral antigen's bindin",
    "and SV40 transformed endothelial cells (SVEC) (Kim et al., J. Immunol., 40:457-465, 1994) derived from C3H/HeJ mice. However, other types of cells, such as intestinal brush borders isolated from 10-to 14-day old suckling mice, which express sufficient number of FcRn can be also used. Alternatively, mammalian cells which express recombinant FcRn of a species of choice can be also utilized. After counting the radioactivity of the bound fraction of modified IgG or that of wild type, the bound molecules can be then extracted with the detergent, and the percent release per unit number of cells can be calculated and compared.</p>Affinity of modified IgGs or fragments thereof for FcRn can be measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurement using, for example, a BIAcore 2000 (BIAcore Inc.) as described previously (Popov et al., Mol. Immunol., 33:493-502, 1996; Karlsson et al., J. Immunol. Methods, 145:229-240, 1991, both of which are incorporated by reference in their entireties). In this method, FcRn molecules are coupled to a BIAcore sensor chip (e.g., CM5 chip by Pharmacia) and the binding of modified IgG to the immobilized FcRn is measured at a certain flow rate to obtain sensorgrams using BIA evaluation 2.1 software, based on which on- and off-rates of the modified IgG, constant domains, or fragments thereof, to FcRn can be calculated.</p>Relative affinities of modified IgGs or fragments thereof, and the wild type IgG for FcRn can be also measured by a simple competition binding assay. Unlabeled modified IgG or wild type IgG is added in different amounts to the wells of a 96-well plate in which FcRn is immobilize. A constant amount of radio-labeled wild type IgG is then added to each well. Percent radioactivity of the bound fraction is plotted against the amount of unlabeled modified IgG or wild type IgG and the relative affinity of the modified IgG or fragments thereof can be calculated from the slope of the curve.</p>Furthermore, affinities of modified IgGs or fragments thereof, and the wild type IgG for FcRn can be also measured by a saturation study and the Scatchard analysis.</p>Transfer of modified IgG or fragments thereof across the cell by FcRn can be measured by in vitro transfer assay using radiolabeled IgG or fragments thereof and FcRn-expressing cells and comparing the radioactivity of the one side of the cell monolayer with that of the other side. Alternatively, such transfer can be measured in vivo by feeding 10- to 14-day old suckling mice with radiolabeled, modified IgG and periodically counting the radioactivity in blood samples which indicates the transfer of the IgG through the intestine to the circulation (or any other target tissue, e.g., the lungs). To test the dose-dependent inhibition of the IgG transfer through the gut, a mixture of radiolabeled and unlabeled IgG at certain ratio is given to the mice and the radioactivity of the plasma can be periodically measured (Kim et al., Eur. J. Immunol., 24:2429-2434, 1994).</p",
    "eas Abdegs have increased FcRn binding at both acidic and neutral pH. To identify novel high affinity FcRn binding variants, we targeted amino acids in one of the key FcRn binding sites containing histidine 435 in Fc region of an IgG, and constructed a library of variants containing randomized sequences between amino acids 432-437 of CH3 leaving the 435 Histidine unchanged. Additionally, an extra random amino acid codon was inserted after position 437, (437*) to determine if additional FcRn binding contacts in the Fc fragment carrying YTE mutations would prove beneficial. The variant Fc library was then displayed on the M13 phage surface and FcRn binding variants were selected against recombinant human FcRn protein coated in ELISA wells in pH 6.0 buffer. Sequence analysis of panning outcomes revealed a unique group of variants containing cysteines at 432 and 437 positions. One variant, N3E-YTE (Table 1) and its derivatives were then converted to HB20.3 anti-CD20 IgG background. SPR binding analysis showed that an IgG carrying the double cysteine variant, e.g., N3E-YTE, improved FcRn binding greater than 50-fold over the YTE variant at pH 6.0 (Table 1). However, the pH 7.4 binding of the variant to FcRn also increased significantly, resulting in poor pH binding dependency.\nTable 1.

    "nti-CD20 IgG1 background were moved to an additional IgG1 background, motavizumab (Wu at al. (2007) J. Mol. Biol. 368, 652-665), to confirm the clones FcRn binding characteristics in the context of different variable domains. As previous studies have shown that variable domains can contribute to FcRn binding variability in wt Fc backgrounds (Suzuki et al. (2010) J. Immunol. 184, 1968-1976; Wang et al. (2011) Drug Metab. Dispos. 39, 1469-1477; Datta-Mannan et al. (2012) Drug Metab. Dispos. 40, 1545-1555), we wanted to confirm that the FcRn binding properties of our variants were transferable. ZXXHXZ (SEQ ID NO:14) library clones Y12-YTE, Y31-YTE and Y3-YTE were generated as IgGs with Motavizumab variable domains. The pH 6.0 binding of these clones as well as YTE and N3E-YTE, are consistent with those in the anti-CD20 background (Table 2). Interestingly, pH 7.4 binding varies when clones were shifted to different antibody variable domains with either increased binding (Y31-YTE) or decreased binding (YTE). Additionally, for Y12-YTE and Y31-YTE, clones were also generated in the wild type Mota Fc background (lacking YTE) e.g. Y12 and Y31. These constructs were generated to show the contribution the H435 loop mutations alone made to FcRn binding. Y12 and Y31 did maintained enhanced FcRn binding at pH 6.0 and pH dependency (low binding at pH 7.4). These data indicate that YTE and the H435 mutations such as Y12 and Y31 have an additive effect on pH dependent binding. N3 with pH 6.0 KD of 89 nM and a pH 7.4 KD of 1630 nM had similar binding in the motavizumab background as in the anti-CD20 background.\nTable 2A.
