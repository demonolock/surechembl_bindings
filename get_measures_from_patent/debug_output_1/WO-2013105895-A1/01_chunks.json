    "egulation of protein kinases by mutation, gene rearrangement, gene amplification, and overexpression of both receptor and ligand has been implicated in the development and progression of human cancers. Protein kinase inhibiting compounds or protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs) are therefore useful for treating diseases caused by or exacerbated by overexpression or upregulation of protein kinases. For example, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs also known as tyrphostins) have been shown be effective anti-tumor agents and anti-leukemic agents (Lowery A et. al., Front Biosci. 201 1 Jun 1 ; 17: 1996-2007). </p>A major objective of formulation chemistry is to improve drug efficiency and safety, by e.g. improving bioavailability and stability as well as convenience to the patient. Bioavailability means the rate and extent to which an active substance or therapeutic is absorbed from a pharmaceutical form and becomes available at the site of action. The most common and preferred method of delivery due to convenience, ease of ingestion, and high patient compliance to treatment is the oral route of drug delivery. However, for certain drugs, drug absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is limited by poor aqueous solubility and/or poor membrane permeability of the drug molecules. PKIs are generally weak bases that dissolve only slightly at low pH (e.g. 100-1000 mg/L) and are practically insoluble at neutral pH (e.g. 0.1 -10 mg/L). Therefore, enhancing the solubility and dissolution rate of PKI- based drugs is important for improving the bioavailabitity and efficacy of most of these drugs. Typical PKIs exhibit non-polypetide structure and have relatively low molecular weights, such as &lt; 10000 dalton or &lt; 5000 dalton. \n\n Several methods to improve the dissolution characteristics of poorly water soluble drugs have been reported, including micronisation, formation of salts or solvates, complexes and microspheres. Additionally, attempts have been made to improve bioavailability provided by solid dosage forms by forming particles comprising the drug or by mixing the poorly water soluble drug with hydrophilic excipients. Traditionally, however, these methods carry inherent limitations concerning physical stabilities of the particles on storage, problems with grinding or difficulty of removal of the frequently toxic solvent. Furthermore, it is important that the drug released from the solid phase does not precitipitate in the gastrointestinal tract, or precipitates as little as possible, but remains water-soluble in the aqueous fluids of the gastrointestinal tract, since such precipitation results in low bioavailability (see e.g. Herve J. et al. Pharm Dev Technol. 201 1 Jun; 16(3):278-86). pH-dependent solubility is a well-known issue for many oral formulations of poorly water-soluble substances, such as PKIs, since most of the absorption of the drug occurs in the small and large intestine, where pH is close to neutral. There is thus a continuing need to develop and improve the dissolution characteristics of oral solid dosage forms of PKI-based drugs. (Budha NR, Frymoyer A, Smelick GS, Jin JY, Yago MR, Dresser MJ, Holden SN, Benet LZ, Ware JA. Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2012 </p>Aug;92(2):203-13). Therefore, methods for improving dissolution of PKI- based drugs, as well as of other poorly water-soluble drugs, at neutral (intestinal) pH are highly desirable. </p>US20090203709 discloses a pharmaceutical dosage form comprising a solid dispersion product of at least one tyrosine kinase inhibitor, at least one pharmaceutically acceptable polymer and at least one </p>pharmaceutically acceptable solubilizer.

Further details are set out in Example 15. \n\n Detailed description of the invention </p> All patents, patent applications, and publications cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. As used herein, the phrase \"hybrid nanoparticles\" refers to a group of particles, typically in the average size range of from 1 to 1000 nm, composed of at least two components, one of which is the PKI and the other a polymeric stabilizing and matrix-forming component. The particles can be either crystalline or amorphous, or a mixture thereof. Typically, in the sense of the present disclosure, the particles are \"amorphous\", or \"essentially amorphous\". This means that almost all, if not all, content of the particles comprise amorphous protein kinase inhibitor and polymeric stabilizing and matrix-forming component. The level or degree of amorphicity is at least 60%, such as 70%, such as 80% or 85%, preferably at least 90% and more preferably &gt;95%, wherein 100% represents that all material is amorphous in the particles. </p>Quantification of crystalline PKI or absence of crysalline PKI may be measured by X-ray powder diffraction metods as described in Saleki- Gerhardt A et al. Int J Pharm. 1994; 101 :237-247) or by water vapor sorption as described in Dash AK et al. J Pharm Sci. 2002 Apr;91 (4):983- 90. </p>The term \"solid dispersion particles\" relates to \"hybrid nanoparticles\" as defined above, however, solid dispersion particles are typically larger or much larger in size (typically \u03bc\u03b9 -mm, as decribed in Wu K. et al. J Pharm Sci. 2009 Jul;98(7):2422-3). The smaller size of hybrid nanoparticles contributes to further stabilizing the PKI against crystallization. Typically, hybrid nanoparticles is in the average size range of from 1 to 1000 nm, such as below 500 nm, preferably below 250 nm. \n\n The phrase \"stable\" refers to the level of stability of produced particles by the methods of the present invention and may be measured as the capability of the hybrid nanoparticles to remain in their physical state for 6- 12 months storage at ambient temperature (e.g. 18-25\u00b0C). The level of stability may be measured by AUC measurements of dissolution rate over for instance 80 minutes of the particles, after such storage. </p>By the phrase \"protein kinase inhibitor\" or \"\u03a1\u039a is meant a type of enzyme inhibitor that specifically blocks the action of one or more protein kinases. PKIs include, but are not limited, to protein kinase inhibitors and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as axitinib, afatinib, bosutinib, crizotinib, cediranib, dasatinib, erlotinib, fostamatinib, gefitinib, imatinib, lapatinib, lenvatinib, lestaurtinib, motesanib, mubritinib, nilotinib, pazopanib, pegaptanib, ruxolitinib, sorafenib, semaxanib, sunitinib, tandunitib, tipifamib, vandetanib and vemurafenib; or salts or hydrates or solvates thereof, or combinations thereof. </p>By the phrase \"polymeric stabilizing and matrix-forming component\" is meant the component present in the hybrid nanoparticles together with the PKI. Typically, said polymeric stabilizing and matrix-forming component exhibits a polymeric structure, such as, but not limited to, methyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose (e.g. HPC ef, HPC If and HPC jf), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (e.g. Methocel E3 and E15 and Pharmacoat), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMC AS), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate (e.g. HPMCP-HP55), polyvinylpyrrolidone (e.g. PVP 30K and PVP 90K), polyvinyl acetate phthalate (PVAP), copolyvidone (e.g. Kollidon VA 64), crospovidon (e.g. Kollidon CL), methacrylic acid and ethylacrylate copolymer (e.g. Kollicoat ME), methacrylate acid and methyl methacrylate copolymer (e.g. Eudragit L100), polyethylene glycol (PEG), DL lactide/glycolide copolymer, poly DL- lactide, cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP), aminoalkyl methacrylate copolymers (e.g. Eudragit RL100, RL PO or RS PO), carbomer \n\n homopolymer Type A (e.g. Carbopol 971 P), carbomer homopolymer Type B (e.g. Carbopol 974P) and Poloxamers (e.g. Pluronics, Kolliphor). </p>The term \"polymer\" or \"polymeric\" is here used to mean a compound that is made of monomers connected together to form a larger molecule. A polymer generally consists of 20 or more monomers connected together, however less than 20 monomers connected together are here also referred to as polymers. The term \"solubilizer\" is here used to mean a compound that increases the solubility of a substance, such as, but not limited to, polyvinyl caprolactam- polyvinyl acetate-polyethylene glycol copolymer (Soluplus), d-a-tocopherol acid polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS), PEG-40 hydrogenated castor oil (Cremophor RH40), PEG-35 castor oil (Cremophor EL), PEG-40 stearate (MYRJ 540), hard fat (e.g. Gelucire 33/01 ), polyoxylglycerides (e.g. Gelucire 44/14), stearoyl polyoxylglycerides (e.g. Gelucire 50/13), PEG-8 caprylic/capric glycerides (e.g. Labrasol) and Poloxamers (e.g. Pluronics, Kolliphor). As used herein, the phrase \"primary particles\" refers to the smallest particulate entities formed during the precipitation process. The boundaries of the particles are analyzed by SEM microscopy. Depending on process parameters, the primary particles may build together a more or less dense and porous network forming larger, agglomerated or bridging particles. Parameters affecting the agglomeration are e.g. temperature that may modify the softness of the primary particles; ratio solvent/antisolvent affecting precipitation time, concentration of the PKI solution; and the nature of the polymeric stabilizing and matrix-forming agent(s). The average size of the primary particles is typically between 1 to 1000 nm, preferably below 500 nm, more preferably below 250 nm. \n\n As used herein, the phrases \"supercritical\" and \"supercritical fluid\" refer to that a chemical substance that is set to both a temperature higher or equal than its critical temperature (Tc) and a pressure higher or equal than its critical pressure (Pc). </p>As used herein, the phrases \"subcritical\" and \"subcritical fluid\" refer here to that one of critical temperature (Tc) or critical pressure (Pc) is set to a temperature or pressure higher than its critical temperature (Tc) or critical pressure (Pc), respectively, and the other of critical temperature (Tc) or critical pressure (Pc) is set to a temperature or pressure lower than its critical temperature (Tc) or critical pressure (Pc), respectively. </p>By the phrase \"area under the curve (AUC)\" is meant the area under the concentration-time curve, where the x-axis represents time and the y-axis represents solubilized drug concentration. </p>By the phrase \"apparent solubility\" is meant the concentration of material at apparent equilibrium. See further in the Examples section. The term \"supersaturation\" is here used to mean that a solution contains more of the dissolved substance than could be dissolved by the solvent or media under normal circumstances. </p>As used herein, the term \"Soluplus\" or \"soluplus\" re",
    "urposes of testing hybrid nanoparticles of the present invention, includes Fasted State Stimulated Intestinal Fluid, referred to as FaSSIF, Fed State Stimulated Intestinal Fluid, referred to as FeSSIF, and Simulated Gastric Fluid, referred to as SGF. FaSSIF media is tailored to represent a fasting state and has a pH of about 6.5 as well as particular osmolaric properties. FeSSIF media is tailored to represent a fed state and has a pH of about 5 as well as specific osmolaric properties. SGF is tailored to represent gastric fluid and has a pH of about 1.4 as well as particular osmolaric properties. FaSSIF, FeSSIF and SGF media are generally used in in vitro models for dissolution of poorly water-soluble drugs. The choice of medium will be dependent of the where in the intestinal tract and under what conditions (fasted or fed) particles are desired to dissolve and be taken up. Further details regarding these fluids \n\n are described in e.g. Herve J. et al. Pharm Dev Technol. 201 1 Jun; </p>16(3):278-86 and Jantratid, E., and Dressman, J. Dissolut. Technol. 2009 8, 21 -25. </p>By the phrase \"amorphous form\" is meant non-crystalline solid form. The ease of dissolution may at least in part be attributed to the amount of energy required for dissolution of the components from a crystalline or amorphous solid phase. Amorphous particles require less energy for dissolution as compared to crystalline particles of the same compound. </p>The inventive compositions comprise particles with a PKI or a combination of two or more PKIs. However, the particles may comprise a combination of one or more PKIs and at least one further active ingredient, such as one or more drugs. Various kinds of PKIs can be effectively utilized. </p>The term PKIs (protein kinase inhibitors) as used herein, is intended to include also the hydrates, solvates (alcoholates), pharmaceutically acceptable acid salts, base salts or co-crystals of such protein kinase inhibiting compounds. </p>As used herein, the term water-insoluble or poorly water soluble (or hydrophobic) compounds, refers to compounds whose solubility in water at 25\u00b0 C is less than 1 g/100 ml, especially less than 0.1 g/100 ml in pure water at neutral pH. </p>The stable, amorphous hybrid nanoparticles comprised in the compositions of the present invention are typically in the form of particles as described elsewhere in this specification. There are a number of different methods for the formation of larger particles, e.g. granulation, melt extrusion, spray drying, precipitation etc. all of which typically encompass starting with formation of a mixture between the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) and the polymeric stabilizing and matrix-forming component. The particles \n\n comprised in the compositions of the present invention are produced with continous processes for generating hybrid nanoparticles. Continuous processes in this context means that particle formation is continuously ongoing while at the same time continuously withdrawing/collecting/ retaining hybrid nanoparticles from the mixture after their formation. In the preferred methods, i.e. precipitation methods, this means that a fluid which is a solution of the PKI, preferably in the form of a fluid stream, is mixed with an antisolvent fluid, preferably in the form of an antisolvent fluid stream. The polymeric stabilizing and matrix-forming component may be present in either one or both of the two fluids depending on its solubility characteristics. The mixing of the two fluids is taking place in a mixing function, e.g. a mixing chamber. In the case the process is continuous, i.e. the two fluids are fluid streams, the mixing function typically is associated with a particle formation and separation function wherein the mixed fluid stream may pass through while retaining the hybrid nanoparticles. Agents modifying the particle characteristics without being incorporated into the particles may be added to either one or both of the two fluids before the mixing step. The fluids typically are conventional liquids or supercritical fluids, where supercritical fluids also include subcritical fluids (i.e. fluids for which only one of pressure and temperature is above its supercritical value). Typical combinations are, a) conventional (i.e., non-supercritical) liquids for both the API solution and the antisolvent, b) supercritical solution of the API combined with conventional liquid for the antisolvent, c) conventional liquid for the API solution combined with supercritical fluid for the antisolvent, and d) supercitical fluids for both of the two fluids. In certain variants the antisolvent may be omitted. A fluid stream, preferably supercritical, containing both the API and the polymeric stabilizing and matrix-forming component is then allowed to expand into the particle formation function. It is preferred that at least one of the fluids is in a supercritical state in the preciptiation methods described above. These kinds of precipitation methods are discussed in WO 2005061090 </p>(Censdelivery AB), WO 2009072950 (XSpray Microparticles AB), WO \n\n 2009072953 (XSpray Microparticles AB), WO 201 1 159218 (XSpray Microparticles AB) and references cited in these publications. </p>The term \"solution\" encompasses that the solute is either a true solute or minute particles of colloidial dimensions (typically 1 -1000 nm) and less than the particles to be produced. </p>A preferred particle formation system is the \"Right Size system\" developed by XSpray Microparticles AB, Sweden. A detailed description of the technology can be found in the WO-publications given in the preceding paragraph. An important characteristic of the system is that the two fluid streams should merge within a nozzle at an angle in the interval 45\u00b0-135\u00b0, with preference for about 90\u00b0 and sprayed into a particle </p>formation/separation function. In principle the system allows for producing particles of predetermined size and/or morphology. Here the Right Size system and apparatus will be described using the non-limiting example of a PKI as the drug and CO2 as a supercrititcal fluid antisolvent. </p>The system consists of one pumping set-up for the PKI dissolved in a liquid solvent, referred to as the API solution, and one pumping set-up for an antisolvent, for example CO2, however also other antisolvents may be used when suitable. Each pumping set-up includes instruments such as a flow meter and a pressure meter that are used to control the process conditions. These two pumping set-ups are fluidically connected at a spray nozzle. </p>A stream of liquid API solution is mixed with a stream of CO2 under flow conditions within the spray nozzle. The polymeric stabilizing and matrix- forming component is present in either the API solution or in the stream of CO2. These streams are sprayed at the outlet of the nozzle into a precipitation vessel under controlled conditions (typically pressure and temperature). CO2 acts as an antisolvent and makes the API to precipitate \n\n together with the polymeric stabilizing and matrix-forming component into fine particles. Particles are retained in the vessel by a filtering set-up. A back pressure regulator is typically used to control the pressure inside the precipitation vessel. </p>For preparing hybrid nanoparticles of certain drugs, for example but not limited to pazopanib and erlotinib, it may be advantageous to have an extra pumping set-up for injecting an additional solvent, referred to as a modifier, into the CO2. Here a pumping set-up control is set up for the modifier and the modifier is mixed with the CO2 in a mixer before entering the nozzle. </p>When using the system, the system operator typically starts by </p>equilibrating the system by pumping CO2, an \"PKI like solution\" (a solution similar in composition to the PKI solution but containing no PKI and no excipient) and the modifier (if used) through the system until flow rates, pressure and temperature have reached a desired steady state. Critical parameters for setting up the system are PKI solution composition, PKI solution flow rate, CO2 flow rate, CO2 pressure and temperature, nature of the modifier and modifier flow rate, if such is used. </p>Next, the \"PKI like solution\" is exchanged for the PKI solution and particles are produced and retained downstream of the mixing, e.g. </p>downstream of the outlet of the nozzle. Afterwards, the system is typically cleaned by pumping the \"PKI like solution\" through the system. The particles are dried by flushing CO2 through the retained particles in order to extract any remaining solvent. The precipitation vessel is then </p>depressurized and the particles can be collected. The solution/solvent and the antisolvent are typically miscible with each other. The pressure and temperature in the particle formation function, \n\n and/or upstream of this function, such as in the mixing function, provide supercritical or subcritical conditions in relation to the antisolvent. </p>The concentration of the PKI in the solution is typically below its saturation concentration, such as &lt; 50 %, such as &lt; 60 %, such as &lt; 75 %, such as</p>&lt; 85 % or such as &lt; 95 % of the saturation concentration. Suitable concentrations are typically found in the interval &lt; 20 %, such as &lt; 10 % or</p>&lt; 5 % or &lt; 3 % with lower limits being &lt; 005 % or 0.1 % (all in w/v-%). The term \"volatile\" for solvents typically means boiling points of &lt; 200\u00b0C, such as &lt; 150\u00b0C or &lt; 100\u00b0C, at atmospheric pressure. Examples are inorganic solvents and organic solvents with particular emphasis of dimethyl sulfoxide and trifluoroethanol and mixtures thereof. The term solvent includes mixtures of liquids which are miscible with each other. The solutions may contain agents that enhance or diminish the solubility of the PKI, e.g. acidic, alkaline, buffer components and/or other organic solvents. </p>Illustrative fluids which can be used as an antisolvent are </p> a) gaseous at room temperature and atmospheric pressures, or b) liquid at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. </p>The antisolvent is typically selected for its ability to be readily dispersed into small droplets and for its ability to act as an atomizing agent and antisolvent against the PKI present in the solution. Compounds/elements according to group (a) may be selected from carbon dioxide (Pc = 74 bar and Tc = 31 \u00b0C) (preferred), nitrous oxide (Pc = 72 bar and Tc = 36\u00b0C), sulphur hexafluoride (Pc = 37 bar and Tc = 45\u00b0C), ethane (Pc = 48 bar and Tc = 32\u00b0C), ethylene (Pc = 51 bar and Tc = 10\u00b0C), xenon (Pc = 58 bar and Tc = 16\u00b0C), trifluoromethane (Pc = 47 bar and Tc = 26\u00b0C), chlorotrifluoromethane (Pc = 39 bar and Tc = 29\u00b0C) and nitrogen (Pc = 34 bar and Tc = -147\u00b0C) and mixtures containing these compounds/elements. Pc stands for critical pressure and Tc for critical \n\n temperature. Compounds according to group (b) are typically selected amongst conventional liquids of the same general types as discussed for solvents above but with the difference that the PKI present in the solution must be poorly soluble in the antisolvent. Particular liquids of group (b) comprise methanol, ethanol, acetone water and mixtures containing one or more of these fluids. </p>The antisolvents of group (a) above are typically used at pressures and temperatures providing i) supercritical conditions (supercritical fluid) or ii) a subcritical conditions (subcritical fluid) in the particle formation function and/or upstream of this function, such as in the mixing function and upstream of this latter function. </p>Variant (i) means pressures and temperatures which are typically above the critical pressure Pc and critical temperature Tc of the antisolvent used. For the pressure this typically means pressures in the interval (1.0-7.0) x Pc or in the interval &gt; 10 bar, suitably &gt; 20 bar with preference for &gt; 30 bar, higher than Pc with illustrative upper limits being 100 bar, 200 bar and 300 bar higher than Pc. For the temperature this typically means temperatures within (1 .0-4.0) x Tc or in the interval of &gt; 5\u00b0C, suitably &gt; 10\u00b0C with preference for &gt; 15\u00b0C above Tc with illustrative upper limits being 10\u00b0C, 40\u00b0C and 50\u00b0C above Tc. </p>Variant (ii) means that at least one of temperature and pressure, with preference for only the temperature, is/are below the critical value. (Tc and Pc, respectively). Thus the temperature may be in the interval of (0.1 -1 ) x Tc, such as (0.5-1 ) x Tc, or lower. Further, the temperature may be low, such as -",
    "p>hydrogenated castor oil. Furthermore, said solubilizer may be a poloxamer. </p>The compositions comprising stable, amorphous hybrid nanoparticles comprising at least one protein kinase inhibitor and at least one polymeric stabilizing and matrix-forming component, display increased dissolution rate. </p>Consequently, in another embodiment of this aspect, there is provided a composition comprising stable, amorphous hybrid nanoparticles, comprising at least one protein kinase inhibitor and at least one polymeric stabilizing and matrix-forming component, wherein said hybrid </p>nanoparticles display an increased dissolution rate of said protein kinase \n\n inhibitor, compared to the dissolution rate of said protein kinase inhibitor in raw, crystalline form. </p>Typically, said dissolution rate is measured by a flow through cell system in sink conditions, e.g., according to the US Pharmacopea (USP4). </p> Dissolution measurement in sink conditions of hybrid nanoparticles may be measured in a method consisting of adding the wished amount of powder into a flow through cell system (SOTAX, Allschwill, Switzerland), mounting the cell onto its apparatus and then pumping the appropriate medium (typically FaSSIF, FeSSIF, SGF) through the powder. The temperature of the apparatus is typically set to 37\u00b0C. The amount of powder added into the cell depends on drug load of the powder: The exact amount of powder can be calculated from results obtained from drug load analysis of the powders. The PKI may be added into the flow through cell and a flow rate between 5 and 25 ml medium/min is pumped through the powder. One ml samples of the medium passing through the cell is collected at </p>predetermined times and subsequently analyzed by HPLC (e.g. C18 column Eclipse, 4.6 mm x 15 cm, 1 ml/min, detection 254 to 400 nm). Samples are typically taken after 0, 0.5, 1 , 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 min from the moment the medium comes out from the flow through cell. The accumulated % solubilized of the amount of active substance added into the flow through cell can be calculated and plotted against time (min). The initial slope (\"initial dissolution rate\", representing 0-10 minutes) of the graph may be estimated and taken as the dissolution rate of the material in sink condition at 37\u00b0C in the given dissolution medium. </p>Preferably, the dissolution rate is measured within the initial 0 to 10 minutes of dissolution. </p>The increased dissolution rate is preferably measured in a solution as a dissolution rate ratio of said stable, amorphous hybrid nanoparticles and \n\n said protein kinase inhibitor in raw, crystalline form. Preferably said ratio is from about 1 .5: 1 to about 500: 1 , such as from about 10: 1 to about 30: 1 . </p>Preferably, the dissolution rate is measured in a solution with intestinal pH, such as FaSSIF or FeSSIF or in a solution with gastric pH, such as SGF. </p>Typically, said dissolution rate is measured by a flow through cell system, for instance in sink conditions. Dissolution measurement in sink conditions of stable, amorphous hybrid nanoparticles may be measured in a method consisting of adding the wished amount of powder into a flow through cell system (SOTAX, Allschwill, Switzerland), mounting the cell onto its apparatus and then pumping the appropriate medium (typically FaSSIF, FeSSIF, SGF) through the powder. The temperature of the apparatus is typically set to 37\u00b0C. The amount of powder added into the cell depends on drug load of the powder: The exact amount of powder can be calculated from results obtained from drug load analysis of the powders. The PKI may be added into the flow through cell and a flow rate between 5 and 25 ml medium/min is pumped through the powder. One ml samples of the medium passing through the cell is collected at predetermined times and subsequently analyzed by HPLC (e.g. C18 column Eclipse, 4.6 mm x 15 cm, 1 ml/min, detection 254 to 400 nm). Samples are typically taken after 0, 0.5, 1 , 1 .5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 min from the moment the medium comes out from the flow through cell. The accumulated % solubilized of the amount of active substance added into the flow through cell, can be calculated and plotted against time (min). The initial slope (\"initial dissolution rate\", representing 0-10 minutes) of the graph can be estimated and taken as the dissolution rate of the material in sink condition at 37\u00b0C in the given dissolution medium. In another embodiment of this aspect, there is provided a composition comprising stable, amorphous hybrid nanoparticles, comprising at least one protein kinase inhibitor and at least one polymeric stabilizing and \n\n matrix-forming component, which provides a solubility increase of inhibitor in a solution, said increase measured as the area under the curve (AUC) during about from 40 minutes to about 90 minutes, in said solution as compared with the AUC of inhibitor in raw, crystalline form. Typically, said increase is from about 2: 1 to about 10 000: 1 , wherein 1 represents AUC of inhibitor in raw, crystalline form. The increase may ",

In some embodiments it may be advantageous to use other PKIs. Examples of PKI include, but are not limited to afatinib, bosutinib, cediranib, fostamatinib, imatinib, lenvatinib, lestaurtinib, motesanib, mubritinib, pegaptanib, ruxolitinib, semaxanib, sunitinib, tandunitib, tipifamib and vandetanib; or salts or hydrates or solvates thereof, or combinations thereof. \n\n In another embodiment of this aspect, said stable, amorphous hybrid nanoparticles has an average particle diameter size of less than about 1000 nm, such as less than about 500 nm, preferably less than 250 nm. In another embodiment of this aspect, said solvent is an organic solvent selected from DMSO and trifluoroethanol, or a mixture of these solvents, or mixture of these solvents with other organic solvent such as </p>DMSO/acetone, DMSO/tetrahydrofurane or trifluoroethanol/ethyl acetate. The compositions of the present invention may also dissolve and the protein kinase inhibitor may be systemically absorbed independently of the pH in the surrounding environment, and typically approximately in equal amounts, especially at both a gastric pH, such as from about pH 1 .2 to about pH 2.1 , preferably about 1 .7 and at a intestinal pH such as from about pH 4.5 to about pH 8, preferably at a pH of about 6. With </p>systemically absorbed, is meant that the protein kinase inhibitor is released from the stable, amorphous hybrid nanoparticles and taken up by the systemic blood stream. Therefore, in another embodiment of this aspect, there is provided a composition, wherein said protein kinase inh",
    "brid nanoparticles in the compositons of the invention will dissolve in vivo in the different environments of the stomach, small intestine, large intestine and colon, it is important to choose an appropriate solution for in vitro dissolution testing. It is critical that the in vitro test conditions mimic the in vivo environment as closely as possible, for example pH and osmolarity. Typically, for intestinal uptake, the pH is between 6 and 7. Therefore, the solution may hold a pH from about pH 6 to about pH 7, such as about pH 6.5. </p>Therefore, in embodiments of the invention, the solution for testing has a pH from about pH 4.5 to about pH 8, such as about pH 6.5 or such as about pH 5. The solutions may represent Fasted Simulated State Intestinal Fluid (FaSSIF) or Fed Simulated State Intestinal Fluid (FeSSIF). Typically, for gastric uptake, the pH is between 1 and 2. Therefore, the solution may hold a pH from about pH 1 to about pH 2, such as about pH 1 .4. Therefore, in embodiments of the invention, the solution for testing may represent Simulated Gastric Fluid (SGF). The choice of solution will be dependent on where in the intestinal tract and under what conditions (fasted or fed) the composition is desired to dissolve and be taken up. Recepies and preparation of these solutions are obtainable from the manufacturer (Biorelevant, Croydon, U.K.). Further details are also disclosed in Jantratid, E., and Dressman, J.

Technol. 8, 21 -25). </p>The amount of PKI in the hybrid nanoparticles in the compositions of the present invention may be less or more, such as wherein the amount of PKI in the hybrid nanoparticles is from about 0.01 % by weight to about 99.9% by weight. \n\n In another embodiment of this aspect, there is provided compositions comprising stable, amorphous hybrid nanoparticles of the present invention, wherein the amount of PKI in the hybrid nanoparticles is from about 10% by weight to about 70% by weight. </p>In another embodiment of this aspect, there is provided provided compositions comprising stable, amorphous hybrid nanoparticles of the present invention, wherein the amount of PKI in the hybrid nanoparticles is from about 10% by weight to about 50% by weight. </p>In some embodiments, it may be advantagous that the amount of PKI in the stable, amorphous hybrid nanoparticles is from 5% by weight to about 50% by weight, from 10% by weight to about 40% by weight, from about 10% by weight to about 30% by weight, or from about 10 % by weight to about 20% by weight. </p>Control of the characteristics of the particles may be convenient for specific applications. Particle size, particle agglomeration, particles porosity and the choice and ratio of the polymeric stabilizing and matrix-forming agent could be modified in order to increase or decrease the surface area to volume ratio of the particle or behaviour of the particles in a </p>gastroinstestinal fluids, leading to an increase or decrease of the dissolution rate. Dependent on the desired dissolution characteristics such particles characteristics may be adapted. Furthermore, particles with differents characteristics may be present in the same pharmaceutical composition to provide an initial dose and a prolonged or delayed dose of active ingredient. Additionally, it may be advantageous to provide different PKIs and/or other active ingredient(s) in different primary particles with different characteristics adapted to provide desired dissolution rates for each active ingredient(s). \n\n Other embodiments of the invention provide pharmaceutical compositions comprising the stable, amorphous hybrid nanoparticles. Such compositions may further comprise at least one pharmaceutically acceptable solubilizer. Said solubilizer may be present separated from the sta",

Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for oral administration are conveniently presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets, each containing a predetermined amount of the active substance. </p>Tablets and capsules for oral administration may contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, fillers, lubricants, disintegrants, or wetting agents. The tablets may be coated according to methods well known in the art. </p>The compositions may be formulated for parenteral administration (e.g. by injection, for example bolus injection or continuous infusion) and may be presented in unit dose form in ampoules, pre-filled syringes, small volume infusion or in multi-dose containers with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulation agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. </p>The above described compositions may be adapted to give sustained release of the active inhibitor. </p>The following examples are provided to illustrate various embodiments of the present invention and shall not be considered as limiting in scope. </p>Examples \n\n Below follows a number of non-limiting examples of compositions comprising stable, amorphous hybrid nanoparticles.

The pressure in the precipitation chamber was set to about 100 - 175 bar and \n\n the temperature was set to about 10 to 50\u00b0C. Both streams contact within the nozzle and the hybrid nanoparticles were formed and subsequently collected in the particle in the collecting chamber. The C02 and solvent passed through the filtering system of the collecting chamber and were drained via the back pressure regulator outlet which maintains the pressure within the precipitation and collecting chambers. After pumping of the PKI/polymer solution and cleaning of the tubing with the same solvent used to prepare the PKI/polymer solution, residual solvents left within both the precipitation and collecting chambers were removed by flushing these chambers with pure SCCO2. After the flushing process, the CO2 was slowly drained off from the collecting chamber. Once the CO2 had been completely removed, the particles on the filtering system were collected for analysis. For l/P/S type particles, a defined amount of solubilizer is added and dissolved into the PKI/polymer solution before pumping the solution through the nozzle for precipitation according to the methods described above. For l/P+S type particles, a defined amount of solubilizer is added to the stable, amorphous hybrid nanoparticles in a glass vial. The glass vial is slowly rotated for mixing of the solubilizer with the hybrid nanoparticles. </p>Table A Stable, amorphous hybrid nanoparticles with exemplary PKIs, polymeric stabilizing and matrix-forming components, solvents, </p>antisolvents and conditions. </p> PKI/Polymer Exp. # Solution Ratio Solvent Temperature </p> cone. % PKI/Polymer &amp; Antisolvent &amp; Pressure</p>(w/v) % (w/w) </p> Axitinib 160, 162 &amp; 5% 25% DMSO 25\u00b0C </p> /Kollidon 581 &amp; C0<sub>2</sub> &amp; 125 Bars</p>VA64 </p> Crizotinib 153, 155, 5% 25% DMSO 25\u00b0C </p> /PVP 30K 156 &amp; 571 &amp; co<sub>2</sub> &amp; 125 Bars</p>Dasatinib 140, 141 &amp; 4% 35% DMSO/Acetone 15\u00b0C </p> /Kollidon 551 (1:2) &amp; C0<sub>2</sub> &amp; 125 Bars</p>VA64 \n\n Erlotinib HCI 511 3.6% 35% TFE 25\u00b0C </p> /HPMC AS &amp; C0<sub>2</sub> &amp; 150 Bars</p>Gefitinib 135, 137 &amp; 4% 35% DMSO/Acetone 40\u00b0C </p> /HPMCP HP55 541 (1:2) &amp; C02 &amp; 150 Bars</p>Lapatinib base 531 5% 66% DMSO/Acetone 40\u00b0C </p> /HPC If (1:2) &amp; C02 &amp; 150 Bars</p>Nilotinib base 501 5% 40% TFE 15\u00b0C </p> /HPMCP HP55 &amp; co<sub>2</sub> &amp; 125 Bars</p>Pazopanib HCI 521 3.6% 35% TFE 25\u00b0C </p> /PVP 90K &amp; co<sub>2</sub> &amp; 150 Bars</p>Sorafenib 561 4% 35% DMSO/Acetone 40\u00b0C tosylate (1:2) &amp; C02 &amp; 150 Bars</p>/HPMCP HP55 </p> Vemurafenib 168, 170 &amp; 5% 25% DMSO 25\u00b0C </p> /CAP 592 &amp; co<sub>2</sub> &amp; 125 Bars </p>General description of dissolution measurement assay </p>The method consists of adding the wished amount of powder of stable, amorphous hybrid nanoparticles into a glass vial and then pouring in it the appropriate medium (typically FaSSIF, FeSSIF or SGF). The medium was prepared in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The amount of powder added depends on the wished \"total PKI concentration\". For some experiments where powders with high drug loads were tested and compared, the real amount of PKI in the stable, amorphous hybrid nanoparticles was not taken in account. For other experiments, the drug load was first estimated by HPLC and the amount of powder to obtain the drug concentration was calculated. Typically, the powder was added in a 8 ml_ glass bottle and 7 ml_ of solution was added (typically FaSSIF, FeSSIF or SGF). The glass bottle was put on a shaker (approximately 1 rotation per minute) for dissolution. Samples of 500 \u03bc\u0399 where taken after different times, and subsequently centrifuged at approximately 15000 g for 3 minutes. The resulting supernatant was then analyzed by HPLC (Cie column Eclipse, 4.6 mm x 15 cm, 1 mL/min, detection at 254-400 nM. Generally samples were taken after 5, 30 and 90 min and eventually 150 min. \n\n Example 1.

The experiments were carried out by measuring concentration of solubilized PKI (mg/L) after 5, 30 and 90 minutes dissolution in a solution at about pH 6.5, namely FaSSIF (Fasted State Simulated Intestinal Fluid). Further, experiments were caried out in an alternative solution at about pH 5, namely FeSSIF (Fed State Simulated Intestinal Fluid). Samples of the solution were taken at various time intervals and the amount of protein kinase inhibitor was measured by the dissolution measurement assay described above. </p>Representative results in FaSSIF solution are provided below in Table 1 and 2, where Table 1 provides data of concentration of nilotinib HCI (mg/L) after 5, 30 and 90 minutes dissolution, whereas Table 2 provides data of % solubilized nilotinib HCI after 30 minutes dissolution, the Area Under the Curve (AUC - mg/min/L) during 90 minutes dissolution and the AUC increase of stable, amorphous hybrid nanoparticles, compared to nilotinib HCI in raw, crystalline form added to the solution (experiments 1 -40).

These improvements were not obtained when physically mixing nilotinib HCI, solubilizer and/or polymeric stabilizing and matrix-forming component (l+S or l+P+S). No particular improvements were obtained with stable, amorphous hybrid nanopartides with nilotinib </p>HCI, a polymeric stabilizing and matrix-forming and a solubilizer (l/P/S). </p>The results carried out in FaSSIF and FeSSIF, respectively, indicate that the stable, amorphous hybrid nanopartides of the invention provide a similar increase in solubility.
