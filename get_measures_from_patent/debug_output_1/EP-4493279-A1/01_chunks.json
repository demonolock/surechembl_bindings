    "tes to a specific ligand for the glycoprotein PCPE-1, characterized in that it is a nanobody (also known as VHH).</p>The glycoprotein PCPE-1 (Procollagen C-proteinase enhancer-1) is a key regulator of collagen fibrillogenesis. The human protein is referenced in the UniProt database under the reference Q15113, where its polypeptide sequence is described.</p>Collagens are synthesized in the form of soluble precursors called procollagens. The latter undergo proteolytic maturation before being able to assemble in the form of collagen fibers. This rate-limiting step is regulated by the glycoprotein PCPE-1, which specifically stimulates the C-terminal cleavage of fibrillar procollagen by BTP proteases, responsible for the removal of C-propeptides from fibrillar procollagens. For this, PCPE-1 interacts closely with the C-propeptide of collagen via its two CUB domains (Complement-Uegf-BMP-1).</p>The term \u201cspecific ligand\u201d designates a compound interacting with a protein in a non-covalent, reversible and specific manner.</p>A ligand is said to be \u201cspecific\u201d when, on the one hand, it binds preferentially to its target protein among a multitude of target proteins with similar structures; and on the other hand, he  presents an affinity, that is to say a force of interaction between said ligand and the target protein, judged to be sufficiently strong. Affinity is quantitatively measured by the association/dissociation equilibrium constant, also called the affinity constant or equilibrium dissociation constant, abbreviated \u201cKD\u201d. The lower the KD value, the higher the binding affinity between the ligand and its target protein.</p>For the purposes of the present invention, a ligand is considered to bind specifically to PCPE-1 if its affinity constant KD is less than 100 nM, or less than 80 nM, or less than 50 nM, and more preferably if it is less than 30 nM. With regard to these numerical indications, those skilled in the art will be able to determine which are the specific ligands of the invention.</p>A nanobody means a single domain antibody, which corresponds to an antibody fragment composed of a single monomeric variable antibody domain, which corresponds to the single heavy chain variable domain of antibodies of the type found in camelids , which are naturally free of light chains. A nanobody is capable of selectively binding to a specific antigen. It has the advantage of having a molecular weight of only 12 to 15 kDa, approximately 10 times less than common antibodies which have a molecular weight of 150 to 160 kDa. A nanobody is also much less bulky than a classic antibody. In addition, the synthesis process, particularly in bacterial cells, is facilitated due to this simplified structure. The first single-domain antibodies were designed from heavy-chain antibodies found in camelids; these are designated VH H fragments.</p>In the present application, the terms nanobody and VHH are used interchangeably and both designate a single domain antibody.</p>The nanobodies each have three CDRs, designated CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3 respectively.</p>The nanobodies according to the invention may in particular be llama nanobodies or synthetic nanobodies.</p>A combination of two nanobodies, covalently coupled, with or without a bondin",
    "ample 3, significant inhibition of PCPE-1 activity corresponds to:</p>- either an inhibition of its interaction with the C-terminal domains of procollagen;</p>- either an inhibitory action on the cleavage of procollagen, which is under normal conditions stimulated by the action of PCPE-1.</p>More particularly, this inhibition of activity is characterized by an inhibition of the interaction of PCPE-1 with the C-terminal domains of procollagen.</p>This inhibition of PCPE-1 activity is considered to be significant when it is greater than 40%, or even at least 50%, and preferably greater than 60%.</p>These PCPE-1 antagonist ligands may be of any nature, and in particular be synthetic chemical compounds, nucleic acids, or even protein structures, and in particular a polypeptide chain.</p>According to a preferred implementation, the PCPE-1 antagonist ligand is a polypeptide chain, and in particular is a nanobody (VHH). It is understood that any polypeptide structure equivalent to a nanobody is included in the invention.</p>Specific nanobodies</p>The inventors have identified two families of nanobodies possessing either PCPE-1 binding activity for use in medical imaging and diagnosis, or PCPE-1 binding activity and inhibitory activity for use as a drug.</p>These nanobodies were selected from a synthetic nanobody library or after immunization of a llama and possess PCPE-1 binding activity measured by surface plasmon resonance as presented in Figure 1. They were selected to possess a KD less than 100 nM and more precisely less than 30 nM (see Table 2 in the examples).</p>These nanobodies were sequenced, as well as their CDRs; the sequences are shown in Table 1 below.  Table 1. Sequences </p>As is well known to those skilled in the art, the combination of CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 is sufficient to define an antigen binding site.</p>For the purposes of the invention, the term \u201cCDR\u201d for \u201ccomplementarity determining region\u201d refers to the amino acid sequences, which together define the binding affinity and specificity of the natural Fv region of a site. native binding of an immunoglobulin.</p>According to a specific implementation of the invention, the specific ligand of PCPE-1 is a nanobody whose polypeptide sequence includes three complementarity determining regions (CDRs) with PCPE-1, characterized in that among these three CDRs, at least a CDR has at least 80% identity with one of the sequences SEQ ID NO. 1 to SEQ ID NO. 15.</p>According to another specific implementation, among these three CDRs called CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3, each CDR is defined as follows:</p>1, CDR1 presents at least 80% identity with one of the following sequences: SEQ ID NO. 1, 4, 7, 10 or 13; ii.

    "His tag in the C-terminal position (gift from Dr. Leo Hanke, Karolinska Institut, Stockholm, Sweden), and produced and purified as described in (Hanke et al., 2020). In parallel, the Sortase A 5M  cloned in the pET30b vector (\u00c0ddgene #51140), with a 6-His tag at the C-terminal, was produced and purified according to the supplier's instructions. The nanobodies were biotinylated on their C-terminus using 50 pM Sortase \u00c0 5M and 200 pM GGGK-biotin (Covalab) in 50 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCb, 2 h at 25\u00b0C. The 5M Sortase and the excess nanobodies were removed by passing through Ni-NT\u00c0 resin (Qiagen; 2 ml), then the excess biotin by passing through Zeba spin (7K MWCO, Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p>SPR analyzes</p>Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments were performed on a Biacore T200 instrument (Cytiva). The ligand proteins, in solution in a 10 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.4 for PCPE-1 or 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4.5 for mini-procollagen III and streptavidin, are immobilized on a CM5 chip by amine coupling. The analytes are diluted in running buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 5 mM CaCb, 0.05% P20) and injected at a flow rate of 30 or 50 pL/min. The competition, epitope binning and kinetics experiments were all carried out at 25\u00b0C. Regeneration is obtained by successive injection of 2M guanidine chloride and 0.5M EDT\u00c0 for 30 sec. The sensorgrams were analyzed using the Biacore T200 Evaluation v3.2.1 evaluation software (Cytiva), using the most suitable models. IC50 was determined by nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism (v8.2.1).</p>Activity tests</p>To characterize the effects of the nanobodies on the activity of PCPE-1, 400 nM of CPIII-Long (or Mini I or Mini II) were incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C with 2.5 nM of BMP-1 and 75 nM PCPE-1 (when present) in the presence or absence of 2 pM nanobodies in the following buffer: 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, 0.02% n-octyl-B-D - glucopyranoside. The samples were analyzed by SDS-P\u00c0GE on 4-20% gradient gels (Criterion; Biorad) and Instant Blue staining (Euromedex). The level of activation by PCPE-1 was assessed as the ratio between the intensity of the C-propeptide band and the intensity of all long CPI II bands (cleaved and uncleaved), after normalization with the condition BMP-1 alone, using ImageQuantTL software (Cytiva).</p>Effect of nanobodies on C-terminal maturation of fibrillar collagens in vitro</p>Rat heart fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM medium, 10% FCS (Eurobio), 1% ASA (Antibiotic-antimycotic solution; Thermo Fisher) at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. At 70% confluence of the cells, the serum was removed and replaced with serum-free medium, containing PCPE-1 (5 pg- <sup>mL'1</sup> ) and/or 15 pg- <sup>mL'1</sup> nanobodies. After 48 h of culture, the supernatants are harvested and the procollagen is analyzed by western blotting using a  anti-C-propeptide antibody (LF41, gift from Dr. Larry W. Fisher, Bethesda, USA). Quantification of the bands is carried out using ImageQuantTL so",
    "presents the results of the selection of PCPE-1 binding nanobodies from the llama nanobody bank or a synthetic bank.</p>The CUB1 and CUB2 domains of PCPE-1 being necessary and sufficient for its activity, we chose to use as antigen a protein containing these two domains, but lacking the NTR domain. Tags used for purification were removed to avoid selection of nonspecific ligands. Two strategies were carried out in parallel: an in vivo selection of llama nanobodies by immunization of the animal and an in vitro selection from a library of synthetic nanobodies.</p>For the immune bank, the nanobodies were generated by five successive injections of recombinant CUB1 CUB2 into a llama, followed by two biopanning steps. 48 clones have  were analyzed by phage-ELISA, leading to 11 unique clones after sequencing. These 11 clones can be classified into six families based on their CDR3s. The first family is the most represented with 5 clones while the others have only one or two variants. 3 members of family 1 (VHH-11, VHH-I5 and VHH-I7) and one member of each of the other families were selected, produced in the periplasm of E.coli and purified. Their affinity for PCPE-1 was measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (Fig. 1A). All except VHH-110 bind to PCPE-1 (Table 2). We note that nanobodies belonging to the same family have very different behaviors. In family 1, the interaction of VHH-11 with PCPE-1 appears less stable than those of VHH-I5 and -I7, leading to a significantly higher dissociation constant (Table 2). Among other llama nanobodies, only VHH-I3 is a strong PCPE-1 ligand, with dissociation constants in the nanomolar range.</p>The selection of the synthetic nanobodies was carried out using three cycles of phage display, then 90 clones were chosen at random and tested by phage ELIS\u00c0 for their ability to bind to PCPE-1. 32% of the clones gave a positive signal, which corresponds to 24 unique clones after sequencing. 7 of these 24 clones also gave a positive signal when tested against immobilized CUB1 NTR. 10 clones (including these 7) were finally produced and purified, and then their affinity for PCPE-1 was measured by SPR (Fig. 1 B). Of the 10, only half give a clear interaction with PCPE-1 when injected at 200 nM, the best results being obtained with VHH-H4 and VHH-H10 (Fig. 1 B) whose KDS are l nanomolar order (Table 2).</p>Measurement of the affinity constant KD of the different nanobodies studied</p>The nanobodies from the synthetic nanobodies bank are designated by names starting with the letter H; nanobodies derived from the serum of an immunized llama are designated by names starting with I.</p>Figure 1A presents the PCPE-1 binding activity of the eight nanobodies derived from llama serum: 11, I2, I3, I4, I5, I7, 110 and 111.</p>Figure 1 B shows the PCPE-1 binding activity of the following ten synthetic nanobodies: H1 to H10.</p>Table 2 below shows the KD affinity constants of seven llama-derived nanobodies (as noted above, nanobody 110 does not bind at all), and ten synthetic nanobodies.  Table 2  Affinity constants less than 100 nM are representative of strong binding; this is the case for the following nanobodies: I3, I5, I7, H4 and H10.</p>Example 2. Determination of regions recognized by nanobodies</p>Figure 2 presents the results of the determination of the PCPE-1 regions recognized by the antibodies. Competition experiments by co-injection of nanobodies with the CUB1 or CUB2 domain of PCPE-1 were carried out (Fig. 2A). When mixed with CUB2, nanobodies I3, I5 and I7 were found to be unable to bind to PCPE-1, whereas the  co-injection with CUB1 has almost no effect, indicating that these nanobodies mainly interact with the CUB2 domain of PCPE-1. On the contrary, the interaction of synthetic nanobodies H4 and H10 with PCPE-1 is prevented by co-injection with CUB1 and not with CUB2, indicating that they interact with the CUB1 domain.</p>For the best ligands from each library (I5 and H4), we then determined whether the other nanobodies had the same epitope or whether they were capable of binding simultaneously to PCPE-1. For this, the PCPE-1 chip was first saturated with the nanobody-I5 or -H4. If no change in the signal is observed when VHH-I5 is then coinjected with the other llama nanobodies, the co-injection of VHH-I5 and VHH-H4 or -H10 leads to a strong increase in the signal. (Fig. 2B), indicating that they bind simultaneously to distinct sites on PCPE-1. Similarly, when the surface is first saturated with VHH-H4 (Fig. 2C), the llama nanobodies are still able to interact with PCPE-1 whereas VHH-H10 can no longer bind. These results confirm that the two libraries have different epitopes, but that within a library, the epitopes are rather conserved.</p>PCPE-2 is a protein in the same family as PCPE-1, with an amino acid sequence that is 43% identical. It shares certain activities with PCPE-1, but also has very different specific functions. The specificity of nanobody interaction for PCPE-1 versus PCPE-2 was analyzed by SPR. For this, VHH-I5 and VHH-H4 were biotinylated on their C-terminal end using sortase, then immobilized on a streptavidin surface. In both cases, the interaction with PCPE-2 is almost undetectable (KD &gt; 1 pM) while PCPE-1 binds very strongly (KD = 1.5 nM (VHH-I5) and KD = 3.9 nM (VHH-H4) , Fig. 2D-E and Table 3 below). The affinity of VHH-I5 and -H4 for PCPE-1 is therefore at least 250 times stronger than for PCPE-2.</p>Table 3 </p>Example 3: Inhibitory antagonistic effects on PCPE-1 of the nanobodies according to the invention</p>Figure 3 presents the results of the inhibitory effect of the nanobodies according to the invention on the activity of PCPE-1. The activity of PCPE-1 occurs through its direct interaction with C-  TJ propeptides of procollagens. We therefore observed whether the nanobodies were capable of preventing the attachment of PCPE-1 to a mini-procollagen III (Mini III, composed of the C-terminal domains of procollagen III: end of the triple helix, C-telopeptide and C- propeptide) using SPR competition experiments.</p>The results show that VHH-I3, -I5, -I7, -H4 and -H10 inhibit the binding of PCPE-1 to Mini III while VHH-11, -I2, -I4 and -111 do not. of effect (Fig. 3A).</p>VHH-H4, -H10 and VHH-I5 are the most effective, with 50 to 75% inhibition at 250 nM.</p>Furthermore, their antagonistic effects are additive, and the co-injection of a mixture of VHH-I5 and VHH-H4 with PCPE-1 practically eliminates its interaction with Mini III. This inhibitory effect increases with concentration, with IC50s estimated at approximately 45 nM (VHH-H4), 24 nM (VHH-I5) and 20 nM (mix of VHH-I5 and VHH-H4) in the presence of 5 nM of PCPE- 1.</p>However, if complete inhibition is achieved at high concentration for VHH-H4, the addition of VHH",
    "mic fibrotic conditions, rat heart fibroblasts were treated with recombinant human PCPE-1 protein (Fig. 3C,D). The addition of PCPE-1 to the medium increases the release of the C-propeptide of procollagen I by a factor of approximately 2.5 on average. The presence of VHH-I5 and VHH-H4 inhibits the effect of PCPE-1 (by approximately 40%), as shown by the decrease in C-propeptide (Fig. 3C). Very clearly, joint treatment with VHH-I5 and VHH-H4 completely blocks the effect of exogenous PCPE-1, with a return to the basal quantity of C-propeptide released. Furthermore, treatment of cells with VHHs alone (in the absence of added PCPE-1) has no effect on the release of C-propeptide.  All these results suggest that the selected ligands are potent antagonists of PCPE-1, capable of blocking the stimulation of C-terminal maturation of procollagens by PCPE-1.</p>Example 4: Construction and characterization of a diabody (divalent nanobody)</p>Previous results suggest that combining I5 and H4 nanobodies in the same polypeptide chain could further improve their affinity for PCPE-1 thanks to the cooperativity of the sites.</p>Figure 4 presents the results obtained for the diab-D1 diabody of SEQ ID NO. 21, produced in bacteria.</p>The interaction of diab-D1 with PCPE-1 was assessed by SPR, by injection of increasing concentrations of diab-D1 onto immobilized PCPE-1. The benefit linked to the fusion of VHHs is clearly visible with the avidity it provides, and which is manifested by an improved dissociation constant (KD = 0.32 nM) and a much slower dissociation (Fig. 4A).</p>On the other hand, competition experiments were performed to determine whether diab-D1 had more potent antagonistic power than the nanobodies used individually (Fig. 4B). The IC50 calculated for diab-D1 is estimated at 3.5 nM, it is significantly lower than that of VHH-I5 and VHH-H4 alone or co-injected (5 to 13-fold) under the same conditions. Likewise, the addition of diab-D1 completely blocks the stimulation of CPH I -Long cleavage by PCPE-1 (Fig. 4C).</p>Effect of diab-D1 on the cleavage of procollagens I and II</p>The diabody diab-D1 is also capable of blocking the activity of PCPE-1 on other fibrillar collagens. Indeed, the addition of diab-D1 inhibits the activation of the cleavage of Miniprocollagen I (Mini I) and II (Mini II) by PCPE-1 as illustrated in Figure 4D.</p>Modulation of collagen maturation by diab-D1</p>In cell culture (Fig. 4E, 4F), diab-D1 is able to completely block the effect of the addition of PCPE-1 on the cleavage of endogenous procollagen I by rat heart fibroblasts. On the other hand, and unlike individual VHHs, the diabody also inhibits the cleavage of the C-propeptide in the absence of added PCPE-1.</p>The diabody also inhibits the cleavage of procollagen I produced by human skin fibroblasts, whether in the basal state or in \u201cfibrotic\u201d conditions mimicked by TGF-beta stimulation, or in the presence of added exogenous PCPE-1. .</p>This is illustrated in Figures 4G and 4H, which show immunodetection of procollagen I and its C-terminal cleavage products in the culture medium of human skin fibroblasts, after 72 hours of culture in the absence or presence of PCPE-1 , TGF-beta and diab-D1.
