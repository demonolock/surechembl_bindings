    "ubated with \u00b3H-oxotremorine M (84.9 Ci/mmol, NEN) alone or in the presence of test compound in a total volume of 1.5 ml for 40 min. at 30\u00b0C. The reaction was stopped by adding 5 ml ice-cold buffer and filtered through Whatman GF/B filters soaked previously in 0.1% polyethylenimin (Sigma) for minimum 30 min. The filters were washed once with the same volume of buffer, transferred to scintillation vials and extracted in scintillation fluid (Pico-fluor 15, Packard) for at least two hours before counted in a liquid scintillation spectrometer (Beckman LS 1800). Non-specific binding was estima\u00adted at 10 \u00b5M atropine and all estimations made in triplicate. At least two displacement curves were made for each compound tested.</p>\u00b3H-pirenzepine bindingwas performed essentially as described by Watson et al., 1983, the conditions being very much the same as for \u00b3H-oxotremorine binding, except that aliquots were incubated with 1.o nM \u00b3H-pirenzepine for 60 min. at 25\u00b0C and that the reaction was stopped by direct filtration followed by 3 washes with 4 ml buffer.</p>Birdsdall N.J.M., Hulme E.C., and Burgen A,S.V.

The exact individual dosages as well as daily dosages in a particular case will, of course, be determined according to established medical principles under the direction of a physician.</p>When "
