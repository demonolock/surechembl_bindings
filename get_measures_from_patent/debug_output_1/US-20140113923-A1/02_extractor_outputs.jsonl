{"raw_mentions": "Mannose binding agents or mannose binding small molecules are defined as having a dissociation constant lower than 100 \u03bcM, more in particular lower than 10 \u03bcM, for binding to mannose as determined by using the experimental setup as described in Shenoy, S. R. et al. in J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 297: 704-710, 2001.\nCarbohydrate binding small molecules or carbohydrate binding agents are defined as compounds having a dissociation constant lower than 100 \u03bcM, more in particular lower than 10 \u03bcM, for binding to carbohydrates determined in analogy with the experimental setup as described in Shenoy, S. R. et al. in J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 297: 704-710, 2001 (which included by reference herein)."}
