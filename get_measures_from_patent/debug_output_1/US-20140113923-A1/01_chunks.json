    "ycle. Monocyclic carbocycles have 3 to 6 ring atoms, still more typically 6 or 6 ring atoms. Bicyclic carbocycles have 7 to 12 ring atoms, e.g. arranged as a bicyclo [4,5], [5,5], [5,6] or [6,6] system, or 9 or 10 ring atoms arranged as a bicyclo [5,6] or [6,6] system. Examples of monocyclic carbocycles include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, 1-cyclopent-1-enyl, 1-cyclopent-2-enyl, 1-cyclopent-3-enyl, cyclohexyl, 1-cyclohex-1-enyl, 1-cyclohex-2-enyl, 1-cyclohex-3-enyl, phenyl, spiryl and naphthyl. Carbocycle thus includes some aryl groups.</p>As used herein and unless otherwise stated, the term \u201chalogen\u201d means any atom selected from the group consisting of fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br) and iodine (I).</p>The term \u201ccarbohydrate\u201d or \u201cSugar\u201d or \u201cglycan\u201d refers to any cyclic or acyclic carbohydrate or multiple carbohydrates coupled to each other. Examples of carbohydrates are glucosyl, mannosyl, ristosaminyl, N-acylglucosaminyl, N-acylglucuronyl, glucosaminyl, glucuronyl, 4-epi-vancosaminyl, 3-epi-vancosaminyl, vancosaminyl, actinosaminyl, acosaminyl, glucosyl-vancosaminyl, glucosyl-4-epi-vancosaminyl, glucosyl-3-epi-vancosaminyl, glucosyl-acosaminyl, glucosyl-ristosaminyl, glucosyl-actinosaminyl, glucosyl-rhamnosyl, glucosyl-olivosyl, glucosyl-mannosyl, glucosyl-4-oxovancosaminyl, glucosyl-ureido-4-oxovancosaminyl, glucosyl(rhamnosyl)-mannosyl-arabinosyl, glucosyl-2-O-Leu.</p>\u201cMannose binding agents\u201d or \u201cmannose binding small molecules\u201d are defined as having a dissociation constant lower than 100 \u03bcM, more in particular lower than 10 \u03bcM, for binding to mannose as determined by using the experimental setup as described in Shenoy, S. R. et al. in J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 297: 704-710, 2001. \u201cCarbohydrate binding small molecules\u201d or \u201ccarbohydrate binding agents\u201d are defined as compounds having a dissociation constant lower than 100 \u03bcM, more in particular lower than 10 \u03bcM, for binding to carbohydrates determined in analogy with the experimental setup as described in Shenoy, S.

The invention also relates to a novel method of treatment or prevention of viral infections of a mammal.</p>The compounds of the present invention block the interaction of carbohydrates of the envelop of virusses with their (co)receptors by binding to these carbohydrates, like for example gp120 of HIV, making the HIV entry impossible. Moreover, it has now been found that resistance development of HIV against such compounds that target the glycans on the envelope gp120 would result in markedly enhanced neutralisation of HIV by the host immune system. In other words, compounds that are directed against the carbohydrates present in the HIV gp120 glycans will select for mutant virus strains that progressively gain deletions in the glycosylation sites of the envelope (i.e. gp120).
