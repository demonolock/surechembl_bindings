    "2 \u00b5g/mL of harseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 antibody in block buffer, washing 6-times with TBST, and measuring HRP activity at 450 nm with a colorometric detection reagent. The absorbance values from wells treated with lysate or with lysis buffer were measured and the background corrected signal was plotted as a function of the concentration of neublastin present in the activation mixture. The potency of PEGylated mutated neublastin (3(,4)X10 kDa PEG NBN106-N95K) in the KIRA ELISA was indistinguishable from that of the wild-type NBN113 material ( Table 8). There was no effect of two freeze-thaw cycles on potency and following this treatment there was no significant increase in the turbidity of the sample, indicating that the samples can be safely thawed for the study. In independent studies accessing the activity of product with three and four 10 kDa PEGs per molecule separately, it was determined that the adduct with three PEGs was fully active, while the four PEG product had reduced potency ( Table 8). These data demonstrate that 3,(4) X 10 kDa PEG NBN106-N95K and 3 X 10 kDa PEG NBN106-N95K activate Ret to a similar extent and with the same dose-dependence as non-mutated (wild-type) neublastin, NBN113. However, although 4 X 10 kDa PEG NBN106-N95K activates Ret to a similar extent as non-mutated (wild-type) NBN113,4 X 10 kDa PEG NBN1 06-N95K is approximately 10-fold less potent than non-mutated (wild-type) NBN113 in activating Ret. Estimated EC50's are provided in Table 8.</p>Example 4: Pharmokinetic Studies of Internally PEGylated Mutated Rat Neublastin NBN106-N95K in Rats and MiceThe pharmokinetic properties of various PEGylated and non-PEGylated mutated neublastin products in rat and mouse models were examined (see Table 8 for summary of results).</p>The data revealed that PEGylation of rat mutated neublastin NBN106-N95K with 3.3, 10000 Da PEGs resulted in a significant effect on the half life and bioavailability of the neublastin. Following a 1 mg/kg IV administration in Sprague Dawley rats, peak levels of PEGylated mutated neublastin of 3000 ng/mL were detected after 7 minutes, and levels of 700 ng/mL were detected after 24 h, 200 ng/mL after 48 h, and 100 ng/mL after 72 h. In contrast for non-PEGylated mutated neublastin N95K following a 1 mg/kg IV administration, levels of 1500 ng/mL were detected after 7 minutes, but then the levels quickly dropped to 70 ng/mL after 3 h and were not detectable after 7 h. The effects of PEGylation were even more pronounced in animals treated with PEGylated neublastin by subcutaneous administration.</p>Following a 1 mg/kg s.c. administration, circulating levels of PEGylated neublastin reached a maximum of 200 ng/mL after 24 h and remained at this level for the duration of the three day study. In contrast, no detectable neublastin was observed at any time point following administration of non-PEGylated mutated neublastin.</p>The analysis of the PEGylated N95K samples are com",
    "erum albumin and analyzed for extent of cross-linking by SDS-PAGE. BSA contains a single free SH group and consequently reaction with the neublastin-SMCC conjugate is expected to result in modification at this site through the maleimide on the SMCC. Under these conditions, two additional bands of higher molecular weight were observed, which are consistent in mass with modification of the neublastin with a single BSA moiety and with two BSA molecules since each neublastin molecule contains two amino-termini that can undergo reaction, and consequently are in agreement with this notion. Concurrent with the formation of these bands, was a decrease in the intensity of the neublastin-SMCC and BSA bands. Based on the intensity of the remaining neublastin band, the reaction appeared to have gone to 70-80% completion.</p>The monosubstituted product was purified from the reaction mixture by subjecting the material to cation exchange chromatography and size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 column (Pharmacia) essentially as described for PEGylation studies discussed above. Column fractions from the gel filtration run were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and those containing the monosubstituted product were analyzed for protein content by absorbance at 280 nm. Since the mass of BSA is approximately twice that of neublastin, the apparent concentration was divided by a factor of 3 to give the neublastin equivalent. This fraction was subjected this to analysis for function in the KIRA ELISA. IC50 values for both the wt-and BSA-conjugated neublastin were 3-6 nM, indicating that conjugation to the BSA had not compromised function.</p>While these preliminary studies were generated with BSA, the corresponding serum albumin proteins from rats and humans also contain a free SH. Consequently a similar approach can be applied to generate a rat serum albumin-rat neublastin conjugate for performing PK and efficacy studies in rats and human serum albumin-human neublastin for performing clinical trials. Similarly SMCC can be substituted with any of a number of cross-linkers that contain an amino reactive group on one side and a thiol reactive group on the other side. Examples of amine reactive cross-linkers that insert a thiol reactive-maleimide are AMAS, BMPS, MBS, EMCS, SMPB, SMPH, KMUS, or GMBS, that insert a thiol reactive-haloacetate group are SBAP, SIA, SIAB and that provide a protected or non protected thiol for reaction with sulfhydryl groups to product a reducible linkage are SPDP, SMPT, SATA, or SATP all of which are available from Pierce. Such cross linkers are merely exemplary and many alternative strategies are anticipated for linking the amino-terminus of neublastin with serum albumin. A skilled artisan also could generate conjugates to serum albumin that are not targeted at the amino-terminus of neublastin or at the thiol moiety on serum albumin.
