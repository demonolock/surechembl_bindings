{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nThe potency of PEGylated mutated neublastin (3(,4)X10 kDa PEG NBN106-N95K) in the KIRA ELISA was indistinguishable from that of the wild-type NBN113 material ( Table 8).\nHowever, although 4 X 10 kDa PEG NBN106-N95K activates Ret to a similar extent as non-mutated (wild-type) NBN113,4 X 10 kDa PEG NBN1 06-N95K is approximately 10-fold less potent than non-mutated (wild-type) NBN113 in activating Ret.\nEstimated EC50's are provided in Table 8.\nFollowing a 1 mg/kg IV administration in Sprague Dawley rats, peak levels of PEGylated mutated neublastin of 3000 ng/mL were detected after 7 minutes, and levels of 700 ng/mL were detected after 24 h, 200 ng/mL after 48 h, and 100 ng/mL after 72 h.\nFollowing a 1 mg/kg s.c. administration, circulating levels of PEGylated neublastin reached a maximum of 200 ng/mL after 24 h and remained at this level for the duration of the three day study."}
