    "pellet was resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.2 mM bacitracin. Polypeptide concentration of the membranal preparation was estimated by the method of Lowry et al. (J. Biol. Chem. 193:265-275 (1951)) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. </p>[0073] A Biomek 1000 robotic workstation was used for all pipetting steps in the radioligand assays as previously described (Cusack and Richelson, J. Recept. Res. 13:123-34 (1993)). Competition binding assays with [<sup>3</sup>H]NT (1 nM), varying concentrations of unlabeled NT, and polypeptide analogs were carried out with membranal preparations from the appropriate cell lines. Nonspecific binding was determined with 1 \u03bcM unlabeled NT in assay tubes with a total volume of 1 mL. Incubation was at 20\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes. Each reaction was terminated by addition of cold 0.9% NaCl (5\u00d71.5 mL) followed by rapid filtration through a GF/B filter strip that had been pretreated with 0.2% polyethylenimine. Details of binding assays are described elsewhere (Cusack et al., Mol. Pharmacol. 44:1036-1040 (1993)). The data were analyzed using the LIGAND program (Munson and Rodbard, Anal. Biochem. 107:220-239 (1980)). The values presented for K<sub>d </sub>are expressed as the geometric means\u00b1SEM (Fleming et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 182:339-345 (1972) and DeLean et al., Mol. Pharmacol. 21:5-16 (1982)). </p>[0074] Radioligand binding assays were performed using various NT analogs. In each case, the equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) was derived for both human NTR1 l and rat NTR1 (Table II). All polypeptides tested had a Hill Coefficient close to unity, indicating that binding was to a single class of receptors. Substituting L-neo-tryptophan for Tyr<sup>11 </sup>in NT (8-13) resulted in the most potent compound (NT64L) tested at the human receptor, and nearly the most potent tested at the rat receptor. In fact, the binding affinity of NT64L was in the range of that found for [L-3, 1\u2032-Nal<sup>11</sup>]NT(8-13) (NT34) at the rat receptor. NT72, a pentapeptide, was found to be the least potent at both receptors. While substituting D-Lys for L-Arg<sup>8 </sup>in NT64L resulted in a polypeptide (NT67L) exhibiting greater resistance to peptidase degradation than NT64L, the NT67L polypeptide exhibited a binding affinity (K<sub>d</sub>=0.61 nM) about six fold lower at the human receptor than that exhibited by NT64L (K<sub>d</sub>=0.09 nM). In addition, steric factors appear to influence NT receptor binding since the results revealed a more than 30 fold reduction in binding affinity for NT64D, which contains the D-isomer of neo-tryptophan, and for NTW, which contains the natural isomer of tryptophan, when compared to NT64L.  \nTABLE IIComparison of binding affinity for NT analogs athuman and rat NT receptors.Kd[nM]PolypeptidehNTRrNTRNT64L0.09 \u00b1 0.01 (3)0.10 \u00b1 0.01 (5)NT(8-13)0.14 \u00b1 0.01 (4)0.16 \u00b1 0.01 (3)NT65L0.32 \u00b1 0.01 (5)0.075 \u00b1 0.004 (3)NT67L0.61 \u00b1 0.06 (3)0.21 \u00b1 .02 (10)NT21.0 \u00b1 0.1 (6)0.8 \u00b1 0.1 (3)NT69L1.55 \u00b1 0.09 (5)0.82 \u00b1 0.07 (4)NT711.8 \u00b1 0.1 (4)0.22 \u00b1 0.03 (8)NT(1-13)\u20031.97 \u00b1 0.07 (130)\u20022.39 \u00b1 0.08 (99)NTW3.2 \u00b1 0.3 (3)0.34 \u00b1 0.03 (3)NT64D3.3 \u00b1 0.4 (3)3.8 \u00b1 0.4 (3)NT66L3.7 \u00b1 0.4 (3)\u20020.85 \u00b1 0.09 (14)NT345.8 \u00b1 0.6 (4)0.046 \u00b1 0.003 (3)NT(tert-Leu)13.2 \u00b1 0.5 (4)\u200219.8 \u00b1 0.4 (4)\u2002NT(9-13)30 \u00b1 2 (3)\u200246 \u00b1 4 (3)\u2002NT7534 \u00b1 1 (5)\u200210.0 \u00b1 0.4 (5)\u2002NT7345 \u00b1 3 (3)\u200232 \u00b1 6 (6)\u2002Eisai95 \u00b1 9 (12)5.4 \u00b1 0.6 (8)NT66D210 \u00b1 20 (10)77 \u00b1 9 (8)\u2002NT74360 \u00b1 10 (3)\u2002160 \u00b1 40 (3)\u2002NT72640 (2)270 \u00b1 30 (5)\u2002\n</p>[0075] In general, substitution of L-Ile<sup>12 </sup>with tert-Leu, a substitute for the natural amino acid leucine, lowered the binding affinity of the NT analogs when compared to their counterparts containing L-Ile<sup>12</sup>. For example, NT(tert-Leu) was about 100 fold less potent at both the human (K<sub>d</sub>=13.2 nM) and rat (K<sub>d</sub>=19.8 nM) receptors than was NT(8-13) (K<sub>d</sub>=0.14 nM and 0.16 nM at human and rat receptors, respectively). A smaller decrease (3 fold) in binding affinity resulted when L-Ile<sup>12 </sup>was replaced with tert-Leu as observed between NT64L and NT65L. </p>[0076] The Eisai compound was found to be almost 20 fold weaker at the human NT receptor when compared to its binding affinity at the rat receptor. Substituting L-Trp<sup>11 </sup>in Eisai with L-n",
    "L, the antinociception and hypothermia results observed after subcutaneous administration were similar to those obtained after intraperitoneal administration with the exception that the observed effects after subcutaneous administration appeared to lag behind the effects observed after intraperitoneal administration. Nasal administration of NT69L also produced antinociception and hypothermia. Specifically, NT69L given nasally to rats at a dose of 5 mg/kg induced a reduction in body temperature, reaching a peak of \u22121.4\u00b0 C. at 30 minutes, and induced antinociception with a peak %MPE value of 70% at 60 minutes. Thus, the nasal administration of NT69L appeared to induce antinociception more effectively than hypothermia. In addition, oral administration of NT69L (20 mg/kg) induced a reduction in body temperature, reaching a peak of \u22120.63\u00b0 C. at 60 minutes, and induced antinociception with a peak %MPE value of 11% at 30 minutes. While the hypothermia response was significant after oral administration of NT69L, the antinociceptive effect was not. Oral administration of NT66L, however, induced significant antinociception and hypothermia. Specifically, oral administration of NT66L (20 mg/kg) induced a reduction in body temperature, reaching a peak of \u22121.4\u00b0 C. at 30 minutes, and induced antinociception with a peak %MPE value of 40% at 60 minutes. </p>Example 6 [0106] Interactions Between Brain Receptors and Neo-Tryptophan-Containing Polypeptide </p>[0107] In a radiolabeled competitive binding assay, NT64L, NT66L, and NT67L were found to compete with labeled ketanserin for binding at the 5HT<sub>2A </sub>receptor in human brain tissue (Table VI). Specifically, NT64L had a K<sub>d </sub>of 6.6 \u03bcM at this receptor in a competition binding assay using [<sup>3</sup>H]ketanserin as the radioligand. In addition, NT2, NT(8-13), and NT(9-13) were found to compete with labeled ketanserin for binding at the 5HT<sub>2A </sub>receptor in human brain tissue. L-neo-tryptophan itself, however, did not compete with labeled ketanserin for binding at the 5HT<sub>2A </sub>receptor. These results indicate that NT analogs can interact with serotonin recognition molecules.  \nTABLE VIBinding-affinities for serotonin receptors.Kd [nM]Human Brain TissueCompound5HT<sub>2A</sub>NT69L34600NT66L8700NT67L7400NT(9-13)6340NT26800L-neo-Trp&gt;100000NT64L6600NT(8-13)4400Serotonin680Haloperidol61Clozapine9.1\n</p>[0108] Additional radiolabeled competitive binding assays were designed to assess the interaction of NT analogs and other ligands with other various types of receptors such as adrenergic and dopamine receptors (Table VII). These studies revealed that NT67L can interact with adrenergic \u03b11 receptors having a K<sub>d </sub>value of 6.9 \u03bcM. In addition, these studies revealed that L-neo-tryptophan itself does not bind to human NT receptors from CHO cells.  \nTABLE VIIComparison of binding at different receptors.K<sub>d </sub>(nM)Human brain tissueadrenergicCHO cellsCompound\u03b11\u03b12MuscarinicDopaminerNTRhNTRNT66L38000n.d.n.d.560000.853.7\u2002NT67L\u20026900&gt;100000&gt;100000&gt;100000\u2009\u2009\u20020.210.61NT69Ln.d.\u2009\u2009\u200258600n.d.133000.821.55L-neo-Trpn.d.n.d.n.d.n.d.n.d.&gt;100000Serotoninn.d.n.d.n.d.n.d.&gt;100000&gt;100000Haloperidol\u2003\u200217600\u2002&gt;100002.6&gt;100000&gt;100000Clozapine\u2003\u200219\u2002168.5211&gt;100000&gt;100000\n</p>Example 7 [0109] Neo-Tryptophan-Containing Polypeptides and CNS Stimulants </p>[0110] Apomorphine was used to assess the ability of NT analogs to act as neuroleptics.
