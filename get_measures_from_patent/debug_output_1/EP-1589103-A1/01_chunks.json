    "l current in a cell utilizing a whole-cell\npatch-clamp method (Hille, B., \"Ionic Channels of\nExcitable Membranes\", 2nd Ed., 1992, Sinauer AssociatesInc.,\nMA).</p>More particularly, a cell expressing the polypeptide of\nthe present invention, or the cell for a screening tool is\nvoltage-clamped by a whole-cell voltage-clamp method, and a\nwhole-cell current in the cell. In the measurement, a\nsolution containing 149 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L KCl, 2 mmol/L\nCaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.8 mmol/L MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 mmol/L HEPES-Na (pH7.4) may be\nused as an extracellular solution, and a solution containing\n147 mmol/L CsCl, 4.5 mmol/L EGTA, and 9 mmol/L HEPES-K\n(pH7.2) may be used as an intracellular solution. Next, a\nchange of the current is measured when a test substance is\nadded to the extracellular solution or the intracellular \nsolution, and as a result, a substance capable of activating\nthe channel of the polypeptide of the present invention or\nthe polypeptide for a screening tool can be obtained. For\nexample, if a change of the whole-cell current generated by\nactivation of the channel is increased when a test substance\nis added, it can be judged that the test substance is a\nsubstance capable of activating the channel. It is\npreferable that the screening method (a) is carried out under\nthe conditions described in Example 4. As a substance\ncapable of activating a channel, a substance showing a change\nof the cell current similar to that caused by PS, more\nparticularly, a substance showing EC50 of 100 \u00b5mol/L or less\nunder the conditions of Example 4, is preferably.</p>According to the above screening method (b) utilizing an\ninflux of a radioisotope ion, the channel activity can be\nanalyzed (preferably measured) by using each radioisotope\ncorresponding to a Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion as an index [Sidney P. Colowick\nand Nathan O. Kaplan, \"Methods in ENZYMOLOGY\", 88(1), 1982,\nAcademic Press, 346-347]. The method is based on a novel\nfinding that the polypeptide of the present invention and the\npolypeptide for a screening tool is permeable to calcium ion\n(Examples 5 and 6).</p>It can be analyzed whether or not a channel of the\npolypeptide of the present invention or the polypeptide for a\nscreening tool is activated, by bringing a test substance\ninto contact with a cell expressing the polypeptide of the\npresent invention, or the cell for a screening tool, and\nanalyzing an amount of radioactivity permeated into the cell,\nor an amount of the remaining radioactivity outside of the\ncell.</p>More particularly, it can be measured using <sup>45</sup>Ca<sup>2+</sup>, a\nradioisotope of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. When a test substance activates the\nchannel in a reaction solution containing <sup>45</sup>Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the\nradioisotope flows into the cell. Therefore, the \nradioactivity contained in the extracellular solution (i.e.,\nthe remaining radioactivity in the extracellular solution),\nor the radioactivity permeated into the cell can be used as\nan index of the channel activation (Toshio Kuroki, Num-Ho Huh,\nKazuhiro Chida ed., Jikken Igaku, Supplement \"Bunshi\nseibutsugaku kenkyu no tame no baiyou saibou jikken hou\",\n1995, Youdo-sha). As a substance capable of activating a\nchannel, a substance showing a Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into a cell similar\nto that caused by PS, more particularly, a substance showing\nEC50 of 100 \u00b5mol/L or less, is preferably.</p>In the above screening method (c) using a detection dye\nfor intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, for example, Fluo3-AM or the like may\nbe used as the detection dye. According to the detection dye\nfor intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, a change in the concentration of\nintracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> accompanied by opening of the ion channel\nof the polypeptide of the present invention or the\npolypeptide for a screening tool can be analyzed (preferably\nmeasured) optically (Yoshihisa Kudo ed., Jikken Igaku,\nSupplement \"Saibo-nai karushiumu jikken purotokoru\", 1996,\nYoudo-sha). The channel activity can be measured by using\nthe dye. When an amount of the detection dye for\nintracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the presence of a test substance is\nchanged in the channel-expressing cell, in comparison with\nthat in the absence of the test substance, it can be judged\nthat the test substance is a substance capable of activating\nthe channel. The screening method (c) is not particularly\nlimited, but it can be analyzed whether or not a test\nsubstance activates the channel, for example, by making a\ncell expressing the polypeptide of the present invention or\nthe cell for a screening tool incorporate the detection dye\nfor intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and optically measuring a change in an\namount of the detection dye in the cell by the test substance.</p>More particularly, if an amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeated into\nthe cell is increased when a test substance is added, in \ncomparison with that in the absence of the test substance, it\ncan be judged that the test substance is a substance capable\nof activating the channel. It is preferable that the\nscreening method (c) is carried out under the conditions\ndescribed in Example 6. As a substance capable of activating\na channel, a substance showing a promotion of a change in an\namount of the detection dye similar to that caused by PS,\nmore particularly, a substance showing EC50 of 100 \u00b5mol/L or\nless under the conditions of Example 6, is preferably.</p>Further, the screening method (a), (b), or (c) can be\nalso applied to a substance capable of indirectly (i.e., not\ndirectly) activating a channel. When a test substance is\napplied, and then PS is applied at a concentration\ninsufficient for 100% activation of the channel (for example,\n10 \u00b5mol/L of PS), it can be judged that a test substance\nshowing a higher activity, in comparison with that in the\nabsence of the test substance, promotes the channel activity.</p>A substance capable of promoting the activation of the\npolypeptide of the present invention by PS can be obtained by\nperforming the screening in the presence of PS, as described\nabove. As a substance capable of promoting the activation, a\nsubstance which can significantly promote the activity by PS,\nmore particularly, a substance showing EC50 of 100 \u00b5mol/L or\nless, is preferable.</p>When the polypeptide of the present invention or the\npolypeptide for a screening exhibiting a cesium, sodium, or\nmagnesium ion-permeable ion channel activity is used, a\nradioisotope of cesium, sodium, or magnesium can be used as\nan index, instead of Ca<sup>2+</sup> used in the screening method (b).\nMore particularly, it can be carried out in accordance with a\nmethod described in Sidney P. Colowick and Nathan O. Kaplan,\n\"Methods in ENZYMOLOGY\", 88(1), 1982, Academic Press, 346-347.\nThis method is based on a novel finding that the polypeptide\nof the present invention and the polypeptide for a screening \nallow a cesium ion, a sodium ion, and a magnesium ion to\npermeate (Example 5).</p>Substances to be tested which may be applied to the\nscreening method of the present invention are not\nparticularly limited, but there may be mentioned, for example,\nvarious known compounds (including peptides) registered in\nchemical files, compounds obtained by combinatorial chemistry\ntechniques (Terrett, N. K. et al., Tetrahedron, 51, 8135-8137,\n1995), or random peptides prepared by employing a phage\ndisplay method (Felici, F. et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222, 301-310,\n1991). Further, natural components (such as culture\nsupernatants or tissue extracts) derived from microorganisms,\nplants, marine organisms, or animals may be used.\nFurthermore, compounds (including peptides) obtained by\nchemically or biologically modifying compounds (including\npeptides) select",
    "d a reagent for RNA isolation (ISOGEN; TOYOBO) were used to\nobtain each total RNA, in accordance with a protocol attached\nthereto.</p>First 5 ng of each total RNA was used to synthesize the\nfirst strand cDNA, and then the PCR was carried out, as\ndescribed in Example 1. In the PCR, oligonucleotides\nconsisting of the nucleotides of SEQ ID NOS: 19 and 20 were\nused as sense and antisense primers, respectively. A thermal\ndenature at 98\u00b0C for 1 minute was carried out, and a cycle\ncomposed of reactions at 98\u00b0C for 15 seconds, at 59\u00b0C for 30\nseconds, and at 72\u00b0C for 1 minute was repeated 35 times.\nEach sequence of the primers was specific for the rat gene\nconsisting of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5.</p>As a result, a DNA fragment of approximately 0.5 kbp was\namplified from each cDNA. From the result, it was found that\nthe rat gene consisting of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID\nNO: 5 is expressed in the primary cultured neurons derived\nfrom the rat brain (cerebral cortex and hippocampus).</p>Example 16: Screening of agent for activating the polypeptide\nof the present inventionA screening of compounds (activating agents) capable of\nactivating the polypeptide consisting of the amino acid\nsequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 was carried out. As an index of\nactivation, a calcium influx into cells was detected by using\na calcium-sensitive fluorescent reagent, more particularly,\nin accordance to the method described in Example 6. With\nrespect to a criterion for screening, a compound showing EC50\nof 100 \u00b5mol/L or less was regarded as positive.</p>Various compounds were examined, and, as a compound\nshowing an increase in fluorescent intensity, N-[3-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-5-methylisoxazole-4-yl]-N'-ethyl-N-methyl-N'-phenylurea \n(code no. SPB 00071; MAYBRIDGE), 3-(2,6-difluorophenyl)-4-(piperidine-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-thiazole-2(3H)-thion\n(code no. MS 1368; MERLIN), 3-(2,6-difluorophenyl)-4-(pyrrolidine-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-thiazole-2(3H)-thion\n(code no.\nMS 1370; MERLIN), and N-(2-acetyl-3-thienyl)-2-[(2-chloro-6-fluorobenzyl)sulfanil]acetamide\n(code no. GK 00678; Ryan\nScientific) (hereinafter referred to as compounds A, B, C,\nand D, respectively) were found. With respect to the\nactivation of the polypeptide consisting of the amino acid\nsequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 by each compound, EC50 values of\ncompounds A, B, C, and D were 9.8 \u00b5mol/L, 6.8 \u00b5mol/L, 1.9\n\u00b5mol/L, and 3.5 \u00b5mol/L, respectively. In contrast, when HEK\ncells not expressing the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2 (i.e.,\nnegative control cells) were used in examining the above\ncompounds, such an increase in fluorescent intensity was not\ndetected.</p>From the results, it was found that the compounds A, B,\nC, and D can activate the polypeptide consisting of the amino\nacid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, and cause a calcium influx\ninto cells.</p>Example 17: Effects of agent for activating the polypeptide\nof the present invention in primary cultured neurons derived\nfrom rat cerebral cortexAny one of compounds A, B, C, and D, and PS was applied\nto primary cultured neurons derived from the rat cerebral\ncortex obtained in Example 13, and a calcium influx into the\nneurons was measured. More particularly, the measurement was\ncarried out in accordance with the method described in\nExample 14, except that the number of cells was 1\u00d710<sup>5</sup> cells.</p>As a result, when any one of compounds A, B, C, and D,\nand PS (the final concentration = 10 \u00b5mol/L) was applied to\nthe cells, an increase in fluorescent intensity was detected\nimmediately after the addition. The result of each compound\nis shown in Figure 3. </p>From the results, it was found that compounds A, B, C,\nand D, and PS, which are activating agents for the\npolypeptide of the present invention, have an activity of\ncausing a calcium influx into the neurons, and t"
