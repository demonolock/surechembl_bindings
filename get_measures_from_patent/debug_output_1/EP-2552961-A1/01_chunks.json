    "nvention may bind IL-25 with an affinity substantially similar to, or greater than, that of the M6 antibody described herein. For example, a target binding member of the invention can have a binding affinity for IL-25 (e.g., human IL-25) of about 50 pM (e.g., about 53 pM) or less, such as, for example about 45 pM, about 40 pM, about 35 pM, about 30 pM, about 25 pM or about 20 pM. A target binding member will generally be specific for IL-25. Thus, the target binding member will not show any significant binding to molecules other than its specific binding partner(s). For example, it has been found that the M6 antibody described herein does not cross-react with IL-17A, IL-17C, IL-17D or IL-17F. Avoidance of such cross-reactivity to other cytokines implicated in asthma and similar processes is a desirable feature of target binding members in some embodiments of the invention. </p> The affinity or avidity of a target binding member an antigen can be determined experimentally using any suitable method. (See, for example, Berzofsky et ah, </p>\"Antibody- Antigen Interactions,\" in Fundamental Immunology, Paul, W. E., Ed., Raven Press: New York, N.Y. (1984); Kuby, Janis, Immunology, W. H. Freeman and </p> Company: New York, N.Y. (1992); and methods described herein). The measured affinity of a particular antibody-antigen interaction can vary if measured under different conditions (e.g., salt concentration, pH). Thus, measurements of affinity and other antigen-binding parameters (e.g., KD, Ka, Kd) are preferably made with standardized \n\n solutions of antibody and antigen, and a standardized buffer, such as the buffer described herein. </p> For example, specificity may be determined by means of a binding assay such as an ELISA employing a panel of antigens, a Biacore assay and/or an Octet assay, among others. A target binding member according to the present invention may recognize IL- 25 and not other members of the IL-17 family, particularly any one of IL-17A, IL-17B, IL-17C, IL-17D and IL-17F; in one embodiment, all five of these molecules. Binding of a target binding member according to the invention with IL-25 may be abolished by competition with recombinant IL-25. </p> Binding affinity and neutralization potency of different target binding members can be compared under appropriate conditions. </p> The invention also relates to a target binding member that competes for binding to IL-25 with a target binding member of the invention that binds one or more amino acid sequences selected from the group consisting of amino acid residues 46-63 of SEQ ID NO: 17, amino acid residues 66-84 of SEQ ID NO: 17 and amino acid residues 129- 135 of SEQ ID NO: 17). In a particular embodiment, the target binding member has a binding affinity for human IL-25 that is less than or equal to about 50 pM. </p> Competitive assays can be performed with the target binding member (e.g., antibody) of the present invention in order to determine what proteins, antibodies, and other antagonists compete for binding to IL-25 with the target binding member of the present invention and/or share the epitope region. These assays as readily known to those of ordinary skill in the art evaluate competitio",
    " the protein. Generally, the target binding member of the present invention will comprise an antigen-binding region that comprises at least one complementarity determining region (CDR 1, CDR2 and CDR3) of SEQ ID NOS. 10, 11 and 12 or variant of at least one heavy chain variable region and at least one human complementarity determining region (CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3) (SEQ ID NO. 6, 7 and 8) or variant of at least one light chain variable region. </p> Target binding members that bind to human IL-25 and that comprise the defined heavy or light chain variable region or CDR regions can be prepared using suitable methods, such as phage display (Katsube, Y., et ah, Int J. Moh Med, 1(5):863 868 (1998)) or methods that employ transgenic animals, as known in the art and/or as described herein. For example, the antibody, specified portion or variant can be expressed using the encoding nucleic acid or portion thereof in a suitable host cell. </p> As stated, the invention also relates to antibodies, antigen-binding fragments, immunoglobulin chains and CDRs comprising amino acids in a sequence that is substantially the same as an M6 amino acid sequence described herein. Such anti-IL-25 antibodies can include one or more amino acid substitutions, delations or additions, \n\n either from natural mutations or human manipulation, as specified herein. Preferably, such antibodies or antigen-binding fragments and antibodies comprising such chains or CDRs can bind human IL-25 with high affinity (e.g., KD less than or equal to about 10- 9 M). Amino acid sequences that are substantially the same as the sequences described herein include sequences comprising conservative amino acid substitutions, as well as amino acid deletions and/or insertions. A conservative amino acid substitution refers to the replacement of a first amino acid by a second amino acid that has chemical and/or physical properties (e.g, charge, structure, polarity, hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity) that are similar to those of the first amino acid. Conservative substitutions include replacement of one amino acid by another within the following groups: lysine (K), arginine (R) and histidine (H); aspartate (D) and glutamate (E); asparagine (N), glutamine (Q), serine (S), threonine (T), tyrosine (Y), K, R, H, D and E; alanine (A), valine (V), leucine (L), isoleucine (I), proline (P), phenylalanine (F), tryptophan (W), methionine (M), cysteine (C) and glycine (G); F, W and Y; C, S and T. </p> The number of amino acid substitutions a skilled artisan would make depends on many factors, including those described above. Generally speaking, the number of amino acid substitutions, insertions or deletions for any given anti-IL-25 antibody, fragment or variant will not be more than 40, 30, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1, such as 1-30 or any range or value therein, as specified herein. </p> Amino acids in a target binding member of the present invention that are essential for functi",
    "orphine; the administration of anti-emetics; or the administration of at least one other compound active against asthma, generally a bronchodilating agent which produces airway relaxation or enhances mucus clearance, e.g. a beta-agonist (e.g. salbutamol, salmeterol), disodium cromoglycate, steroids or an inhibitor of PDEIV. </p>Assay methods </p> The present invention provides a method comprising causing or allowing binding of a target binding member as provided herein to IL-25. As noted, such binding may take place in vivo, e.g., following administration of a target binding member, or nucleic acid encoding a target binding member, or it may take place in vitro, for example in ELISA, Biacore assay, Octet assay, Western blotting, immuno- cytochemistry, immunoprecipitation or affinity chromatography. </p> The amount of binding of target binding member to IL-25 may be determined. Quantitation may be related to the amount of the antigen in a test sample, which may be of diagnostic interest. </p> The reactivities of antibodies on a sample may be determined by any appropriate means. Radioimmunoassay (RIA) is one possibility. Radioactive labelled antigen is mixed with unlabelled antigen (the test sample) and allowed to bind to the antibody. Bound antigen is physically separated from unbound antigen and the amount of radioactive antigen bound to the antibody determined. The more antigen there is in the test sample the less radioactive antigen will bind to the antibody. A competitive binding assay may also be used with non-radioactive antigen, using antigen or an analogue linked to a reporter molecule. The reporter molecule may be a fluorochrome, phosphor or laser dye with spectrally isolated absorption or emission characteristics. Suitable fluorochromes include fluorescein, rhodamine, phycoerythrin and Texas Red. Suitable chromogenic dyes include diaminobenzidine. </p> Other reporters include macromolecular colloidal particles or particulate material such as latex beads that are coloured, magnetic or paramagnetic, and biologically or chemically active agents that can directly or indirectly cause detectable \n\n signals to be visually observed, electronically detected or otherwise recorded. These molecules may be enzymes which catalyse reactions that develop or change colours or cause changes in electrical properties, for example. They may be molecularly excitable, such that electronic transitions between energy states result in characteristic spectral absorptions or emissions. They may include chemical entities used in conjunction with biosensors. Biotin/avidin or biotin/streptavidin and alkaline phosphatase detection systems may be employed. </p> The signals generated by individual antibody-reporter conjugates may be used to derive quantifiable absolute or relative data of the relevant antibody binding in samples (normal and test). </p> The present invention also provides the use of a target binding member as above for measuring antigen levels in a compet",

The Fab libraries were panned against biotinylated IL-25. Fabs showing binding comparable or better than huDDG91 (IgG4) by ELISA were selected. </p> The Fabs were converted to mAbs as follows. A combinatorial library of 5 different light chains and 5 different heavy chains (including the huDDG91 light and heavy chains) was designed. The light and heavy chains used in the library differed from one another in the light chain CDR1 and CDR3 amino acid sequences and the heavy chain CDR 3 sequence. Using these light and heavy chains, a total of 25 mAbs (IgGl) were constructed, expressed in HEK293 cells at small scale and purified. Each of the mAbs was tested for IL-25 binding affinity, cellular inhibition, and receptor inhibition as follows: </p> \u00b7 IL-25 binding affinity was determined using standard IL-25 ELISA and</p>Biacore binding assays. Candidates having a K<sub>D</sub> of less than 50 pM for human IL-25 and a K<sub>D</sub> of greater than 100 nM for human IL-17A, C, D and F were selected; </p> \u2022 Cellular inhibition was assessed using a standard TK-10 human renal carcinoma cell-based assay (IL-25 responsive; IL-25 and IL-8 readout; \n\n capable of discerning difference between soluble IL-25R and parental mAb) and a CD4+ T cell-based assay. For the TK-10 assay, mAbs displaying an IC50 that was lower than parental huDDG91 antibody and</p>&gt;90% inhibition of IL-25 release at \u0399\u039f\u03b7\u039c mAb concentration were selected. For the CD4+ T cell assay, mAbs causing an inhibition of IL-5 production that was greater than or equal to that exhibited by parental huDDG91 were selected; </p> Receptor inhibition was assessed using a modified bead-based electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA). Candidates causing a greater than 3-fold decrease in IC50 of IL-25 binding to receptor relative to parental huDDG91 antibody at a 10 nM mAb concentration were selected. </p> Based on these criteria, 9 candidate mAbs were selected (Figure 3). All candidates showed acceptable expression levels and displayed desirable SE-HPLC and SDS-PAGE profiles when expressed in HEK293 and purified using standard protocols. These 9 candidates were then expressed transiently at 10L scale in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, purified using Mab Select SuRe (GE Healthcare Life Sciences), buffer exchanged into phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and concentrated. The IL-25 binding affinity for each of the 9 candidate mAbs was significantly improved compared to huDDG91. Each of the mAbs was also tested for expression level, identity (SDS- PAGE), solubility, aggregation (SE-HPLC), post-translational modifications, protein- protein interactions and oxidation using routine techniques and assays. Several of the candidate mAbs displayed precipitation during concentration, low yields and/or undesirable SDS-PAGE and SE-HPLC profiles when expressed in CHO, purified, and processed under standard conditions. </p> One mAb, designated M6, was selected for further studies based on superior expression level, high solubility, lack of significant protein aggregation upon purification, and absence of undesired post-translational modifications, protein-protein interactions and oxidation upon purification. \n\n Example 2: Characterization of the M6 Antibody Materials and Me",
    "s and incubated at 37\u00b0C for lhr. Cell culture medium was gently aspirated and replaced with the IL-25 protein / IL-25 antibody complex and cells were then incubated overnight for 18-22hr. Culture plates were then centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 2 minutes to eliminate carryover of cellular debris and supernatant was then collected and assayed for GROa using an ELISA format (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). </p>Results </p> Sequence analysis of M6 revealed a total of three amino acid substitutions relative to the huDDG91 sequence, all of which were present in the CDR3 of the light chain (see Figure 3). The amino acid sequences of the light (SEQ ID NO:5) and heavy (SEQ ID NO:9) chains of M6 and their CDRs are shown in Figure 4. </p> M6 was determined by Biacore to have a binding affinity for human IL-25 that is 3-5 fold higher than the affinity of huDDG91 for human IL25 (Figure 3). Moreover, M6 was selective for IL-25, as it did not bind human IL-17A, C, D or F. Species cross- reactivity of M6 was assessed on cynomolgus monkey 12-25 cynoIL-25 and rodent (mouse) IL-25. Species cross-reactivity with cynoIL-25 was indicated by an affinity \n\n within 5 fold of human IL-25, inhibition in receptor ligand and TK-10 cell based assays. Using these criteria, it was determined that M6 bound to both cyno- and mouse IL-25. </p> Using the cell-based assays described in Example 1, M6 was shown to exhibit increased receptor inhibition relative to huDDG91, displaying a more than 3-fold decrease in IC50 compared to huDDG91 (Figure 3). In addition, using the cell-based assays described in Example 1, M6 displayed increased cellular inhibition of human IL25 compared to huDDG91 (Figures 3 and 5). This result was confirmed by an LS 174T human colonic epithelial cell assay (Figures 6A and 6B), performed as described above. </p>Example 3: H/D-Exchange mapping of the epitope in human IL-25 recognized by M6 Summary </p> The putative epitope in human IL-25 recognized by the M6 antibody was mapped using ExSar\u2122 hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry performed by ExSar Corporation (Monmouth Junction, New Jersey). </p>Materials and Methods </p> I.
