    "ions in solution, methods employing solid phase adsorbed or coupled agents, etc. The method may be in vitro methods or may be methods to be applied in vivo e.g. in the course of in vivo imaging procedures. \n\nIn certain embodiments more than one peptide derived from DNase polypeptides and/or polynucleotides will be determined in a detection procedure. The detection of the level of marker polypeptides or fragments thereof according to the present invention may be the detection of the level of single marker molecules in separated reaction mixtures as well as the detection of a combination of markers simultaneously.</p>\n  Furthermore the detection of the DNase nucleic acids, polypeptides and/or polynucleotides as disclosed herein may be carried out in combination to one or more further detection reactions. These detection reaction may for example be reaction for determination of the presence of further suitable marker nucleic acids and/or polypeptides or of one or more nucleic acids marker molecules in the samples. Further marker molecules, that may be suitable for the detection of proliferative disorders in the course of a method as disclosed herein may comprise e.g. cyclins (Cyclin A, Cyclin, B, Cyclin E), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (p13.5, p14, p15, p16, p18, p19, p21, p27 etc.), cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk2, cdk4, cdk\u03b4 etc.) cell cycle regulatory proteins (p14ARF, pRb, mdm2, p53), proliferation marker molecules (mcm2, mcm3, mcm4, mcm\u03b4, mcm6, mcm7, cdc2, cdc\u03b4, Ki67, Ki-S2, PCNA, DNA polymerase delta, rF Kappa B, etc.), marker for viral infection (such as HBV, HPV (especially high risk HPV: 16, 18, 31, 33, 38, 44, 45, 58, 68, etc.), HIV etc.) or other tumour marker proteins or nucleic acids (e.g. her2neu, CEA, PSA etc.).</p>\n  In certain embodiments the detection of the level of DNase molecules is performed indirectly by determination of the enzyme activity of the DNase. Enzyme activity may e.g. be determined by measuring degradation of enzyme substrates such as DNA. Methods for detection of DNase activities are known to those of skill in the art.</p>\n  The detection of one or more molecular markers may be performed in a single reaction mixture or in two or separate reaction mixtures. The detection reactions for several marker molecules may for example be performed simultaneously in multi-well reaction vessels. The DNase nucleic acids and/or polypeptides disclosed herein may be detected using methods and/or reagents that specifically detect these molecules. Simultaneously one or more further markers may be detected using methods and/or reagents that specifically detect them. The detection procedure for each single marker may comprise one or more steps. In certain embodiments the detection procedure may comprise detection of the marker molecules by a primary detecting step followed by a further secondary detecting step making the result of the procedure available for quantitative and/or qualitative analysis.

In addition, if the active form of the transacting factor is a dimer, dominant-negative mutants of the transacting factor could be made in order to inhibit its activity.</p>\n  Furthermore, upon identification of the transacting factor, further components in the pathway leading to activation (e.g. signal transduction) or repression of a gene involved in the control of the inventive tumour associated polypeptide then can be identified. Modulation of the activities of these components can then be pursued, in order to develop additional drugs and methods for modulating the metabolism of protein degradation in animals. Thus, the present invention also relates to the use of the two-hybrid system as defined above for the identification of the inventive tumour associated polypeptide or activators or inhibitors of the inventive DNase polypeptide.</p>\n  The compounds isolated by the above methods also serve as lead compounds for the development of analogue compounds. The analogues should have a stabilized electronic configuration and molecular conformation that allows key functional groups to be presented to the DNase polypeptide or its possible receptor in substantially the same way as the lead compound. In particular, the analogue compounds have spatial electronic properties which are comparable to the binding region, but can be smaller molecules than the lead compound, frequently having a molecular weight below about 2 kD and preferably below about 1 kD.</p>\n  Identification of analogue compounds can be performed through use of techniques such as self- consistent field (SCF) analysis, configuration interaction (Cl) analysis, and normal mode dynamics analysis. Computer programs for implementing these techniques are available; e.g., Rein, Computer- Assisted Modeling of Receptor-Ligand Interactions (Alan Liss, New York, 1989). Methods for the preparation of chemical derivatives and analogues are well known to those skilled in the art and are described in, for example, Beilstein, Handbook of Organic Chemistry, Springer edition New York Inc., 175 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10010 U.S.A. and Organic Synthesis, Wiley, New York, USA. \n\nFurthermore, said derivatives and analogues can be tested for their effects according to methods known in the art; see also supra. Furthermore, peptidomimetics and/or computer aided design of appropriate derivatives and analogues can be used, for example, according to the methods described above.</p>\n  In a preferred embodiment of the above-described methods of the invention said cell is a cell of or, obtained by a method of the invention or is comprised in the above-described transgenic non-human animal.</p>\n  Once the described compound has been identified and obtained, it is preferably provided in a therapeutically acceptable form.</p>\n  It must be understood, that the compounds and methods as disclosed throughout this text are applicable to any mammalian individual.
