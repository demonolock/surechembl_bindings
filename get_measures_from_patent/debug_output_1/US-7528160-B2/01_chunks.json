    "are completely saturated.</p>As used herein, sulfonamide means the group \u2014NHSO<sub>2</sub>\u2014, e.g., when A is sulfonamide, E-A is C(R3)(R4)\u2014NHSO<sub>2</sub>\u2014. As used herein, acylsulfonamide means \u2014C(O)NHSO<sub>2</sub>\u2014, e.g., when A is acylsulfonamide, E-A is C(R3)(R4)\u2014C(O)NHSO<sub>2</sub>\u2014.</p>In Structural Formulas depicted herein, when more substitutents are indicated on a group than are chemically possible, e.g., when T1 is</p><img id=\"EMI-C00013\" path=\"US07528160-20090505-C00013.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/93442329/US/20090505/B2/000007/52/81/60/US07528160-20090505-C00013.TIF\"/>\nand Z5 is S or O, one skilled in the art will appreciate that excess substituents are intended in the alternative, e.g., that T1 above can be substituted with a substituent selected from R1 and R32.\n</p>A bond to the center of a cyclic group indicates that the bond is to any substitutable atom in the ring. For example, when T1 is the five membered ring shown above, R32 and R1 are bonded to any substitutable atom in the ring. When a bond passes through a ring and ends in the center of a second ring, the bond is to any substitutable ring atom in either ring. For example, in Structural Formula I, E-Y\u2014 is bonded to any substitutable ring atom in either the five or six membered ring. In Structural Formula II, shown below, E-Y\u2014 is bonded to any substitutable ring atom in the five membered ring only.</p>As used herein, the phrase \u201cselectively modulate\u201d means a compound whose EC50 for the stated PPAR receptor is at least ten fold lower than its EC50 for the other PPAR receptor subtypes.</p>When a compound of the invention I has more than one chiral substituent it may exist in diastereoisomeric forms. The diastereoisomeric pairs may be separated by methods known to those skilled in the art, for example chromatography or crystallization and the individual enantiomers within each pair may be separated using methods familiar to the skilled artisan. Diastereoisomer of the compounds disclosed herein and mixtures thereof are also encompassed in the present invention.</p>The compounds of the present invention may contain one or more chiral centers, and exist in different optically active forms. When compounds of the present invention contain one chiral center, the compounds exist in two enantiomeric forms and the present invention includes both enantiomers and mixtures of enantiomers, such as racemic mixtures. The enantiomers may be resolved by methods known to those skilled in the art, for example by formation of diastereoisomeric salts which may be separated, for example, by crystallization; formation of diastereoisomeric derivatives or complexes which may be separated, for example, by crystallization, gas-liquid or liquid chromatography; selective reaction of one enantiomer with an enantiomer-specific reagent, for example enzymatic esterification; or gas-liquid or liquid chromatography in a chiral environment, for example on a chiral support for example silica with a bound chiral ligand or in the presence of a chiral sol"
