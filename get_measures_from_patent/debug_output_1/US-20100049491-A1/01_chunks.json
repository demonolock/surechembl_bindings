    "cally or other methodology; the maximum time allowed for each probe (e.g., 5 minutes); and the number of probes to perform.</p>Also disclosed herein are multi-epitope constructs designed by the methods described above and hereafter. The multi-epitope constructs include spacer nucleic acids between a subset of the epitope nucleic acids or all of the epitope nucleic acids. One or more of the spacer nucleic acids may encode amino acid sequences different from amino acid sequences encoded by other spacer nucleic acids to optimize epitope processing and to minimize the presence of junctional epitopes.</p>DEFINITIONSThe following definitions are provided to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to understand some of the preferred embodiments of invention disclosed herein. It is understood, however, that these definitions are exemplary only and should not be used to limit the scope of the invention as set forth in the claims. Those of ordinary skill in the art will be able to construct slight modifications to the definitions below and utilize such modified definitions to understand and practice the invention disclosed herein. Such modifications, which would be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art, as they may be applicable to the claims set forth below, are considered to be within the scope of the present invention.</p>Throughout this disclosure, \u201cbinding data\u201d results are often expressed in terms of \u201cIC<sub>50</sub>'s.\u201d IC<sub>50 </sub>is the concentration of peptide in a binding assay at which 50% inhibition of binding of a reference peptide is observed. Given the conditions in which the assays are run (i.e., limiting HLA proteins and labeled peptide concentrations), these values approximate K<sub>D </sub>values. Assays for determining binding are described in detail, e.g., in PCT publications WO 94/20127 and WO 94/03205. It should be noted that IC<sub>50 </sub>values can change, often dramatically, if the assay conditions are varied, and depending on the particular reagents used (e.g., HLA preparation, etc.). For example, excessive concentrations of HLA molecules will increase the apparent measured IC<sub>50 </sub>of a given ligand. Alternatively, binding is expressed relative to a reference peptide. Although as a particular assay becomes more, or less, sensitive, the IC<sub>50</sub>'s of the peptides tested may change somewhat, the binding relative to the reference peptide will not significantly change. For example, in an assay run under conditions such that the IC<sub>50 </sub>of the reference peptide increases 10-fold, the IC<sub>50 </sub>values of the test peptides will also shift approximately 10-fold. Therefore, to avoid ambiguities, the assessment of whether a peptide is a good, intermediate, weak, or negative binder is generally based on its IC<sub>50</sub>, relative to the IC<sub>50 </sub>of a standard peptide. Binding may also be determined using other assay systems including those using: live cells (e.g., Ceppellini et al., Nature",
    "he same effect). In addition, modified epitopes might overcome antigen-specific T cell unresponsiveness (T cell tolerance).</p>\u201cHuman Leukocyte Antigen\u201d or \u201cHLA\u201d is a human class I or class II Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) protein (see, e.g., Stites, et al., IMMUNOLOGY, 8<sup>TH </sup>ED., Lange Publishing, Los Altos, Calif. (1994)).</p>An \u201cHLA supertype or HLA family,\u201d as used herein, describes sets of HLA molecules grouped based on shared peptide-binding specificities. HLA class I molecules that share similar binding affinity for peptides bearing certain amino acid motifs are grouped into such HLA supertypes. The terms HLA superfamily, HLA supertype family, HLA family, and HLA xx-like molecules (where xx denotes a particular HLA type), are synonyms.</p>As used herein, \u201chigh affinity\u201d with respect to HLA class I molecules is defined as binding with an IC<sub>50</sub>, or K<sub>D </sub>value, of 50 nM or less; \u201cintermediate affinity\u201d with respect to HLA class I molecules is defined as binding with an IC<sub>50 </sub>or K<sub>D </sub>value of between about 50 and about 500 nM. \u201cHigh affinity\u201d with respect to binding to HLA class II molecules is defined as binding with an IC<sub>50 </sub>or K<sub>D </sub>value of 100 nM or less; \u201cintermediate affinity\u201d with respect to binding to HLA class II molecules is defined as binding with an IC<sub>50 </sub>or K<sub>D </sub>value of between about 100 and about 1000 nM.</p>An \u201cIC<sub>50</sub>\u201d is the concentration of peptide in a binding assay at which 50% inhibition of binding of a reference peptide is observed. Depending on the conditions in which the assays are run (i.e., limiting HLA proteins and labeled peptide concentrations), these values may approximate K<sub>D </sub>values.</p>The terms \u201cidentical\u201d or percent \u201cidentity,\u201d in the context of two or more peptide sequences, refer to two or more sequences or subsequences that are the same or have a specified percentage of amino acid residues that are the same, when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence over a comparison window, as measured using a sequence comparison algorithm or by manual alignment and visual inspection.</p>\u201cIntroducing\u201d an amino acid residue at a particular position in a multi-epitope construct, e.g., adjacent, at the C-terminal side, to the C-terminus of the epitope, encompasses configuring multiple epitopes such that a desired residue is at a particular position, e.g., adjacent to the epitope, or such that a deleterious residue is not adjacent to the C-terminus of the epitope. The term also includes inserting an amino acid residue, preferably a preferred or intermediate amino acid residue, at a particular position. An amino acid residue can also be introduced into a sequence by substituting one amino acid residue for another. Preferably, such a substitution is made in accordance with analoging principles set forth, e.g., in co-pending U.S. Ser. No. 09/260,714 filed Mar. 1, 1999 and PCT application number PCT/US00/1977"
