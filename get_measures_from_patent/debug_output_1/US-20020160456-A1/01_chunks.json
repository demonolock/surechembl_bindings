    "stinct amino acid sequences, are both protective antigens against Helicobacter infection (Michetti et al., supra). Similarly, Cuenca et al. (Gastroenterology 110: 1770, 1996) showed that therapeutic immunization of H. mustelae-infected ferrets with H. pylori urease was effective at eradicating H. mustelae infection. Further, several urease variants have been reported to be effective vaccine antigens, including, e.g., recombinant UreA+UreB apoenzyme expressed from pORV142 (UreA and UreB sequences derived from H. pylori strain CPM630; Lee et al., J. Infect. Dis.172:161, 1995); recombinant UreA+UreB apoenzyme expressed from pORV214 (UreA and UreB sequences differ from H. pylori strain CPM630 by one and two amino acid changes, respectively; Lee et al., supra, 1995); a UreA-glutathione-S-transferase fusion protein (UreA sequence from H. pylori strain ATCC 43504; Thomas et al., Acta Gastro-Enterologica Belgica 56:54, 1993); UreA+UreB holoenzyme purified from H. pylori strain NCTC11637 (Marchetti et al., Science 267:1655, 1995); a UreA-MBP fusion protein (UreA from H. pylori strain 85P; Ferrero et al., Infection and Immunity 62:4981, 1994); a UreB-MBP fusion protein (UreB from H. pylori strain 85P; Ferrero et al., supra); a UreA-MBP fusion protein (UreA from H. felis strain ATCC 49179; Ferrero et al., supra); a UreB-MBP fusion protein (UreB from H. felis strain ATCC 49179; Ferrero et al., supra); and a 37 kDa fragment of UreB containing amino acids 220-569 (Dore-Davin et al., \u201cA 37 kD fragment of UreB is sufficient to confer protection against Helicobacter felis infection in mice\u201d). Finally, Thomas et al. (supra) showed that oral immunization of mice with crude sonicates of H. pylori protected mice from subsequent challenge with H. felis. </p>[0025] Polynucleotides, e.g., DNA molecules, encoding allelic variants can easily be obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of genomic bacterial DNA extracted by conventional methods. This involves the use of synthetic oligonucleotide primers matching sequences that are upstream and downstream of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the coding region. Suitable primers can be designed based on the nucleotide sequence information provided in the sequence listing (odd numbers, up to SEQ ID NO:363). Typically, a primer consists of 10 to 40, preferably 15 to 25 nucleotides. It can also be advantageous to select primers containing C and G nucleotides in proportions sufficient to ensure efficient hybridization, e.g., an amount of C and G nucleotides of at least 40%, preferably 50%, of the total nucleotide amount. Those skilled in the art can readily design primers that can be used to isolate the polynucleotides of the invention from different Helicobacter strains. Experimental conditions for carrying out PCR can readily be determined by one skilled in the art and an illustration of carrying out PCR is provided in Example 2. As is well known in the art, restriction endonuclease recognition sites that contain, typically"
