    "estinal epithelial cells; fig. 8 shows that the morphology of the drug complex exhibits a gradual disruption and degradation from the proximal end of the digestive tract (stomach) to the distal end (large intestine), which is not only advantageous for the adequate release of the drug, but also indicates that the drug complex is easily degraded by the digestive system, avoiding long-term retention in the body.</p>EXAMPLE 5 protective Effect of pharmaceutical compositions on intestinal radiation injury</p>Through analyzing the distribution rule of SP@AMF in a digestive system, the material is found to be about 4 hours after oral administration, and the whole coverage and the drug distribution of the small intestine can be realized, so that the animal is subjected to belly X-ray irradiation at the time point, and the protection effect of the material on the small intestine damage caused by X rays is analyzed through pathological detection: the above drug complex was resuspended in distilled water, and 360mg/kg SP@AMF (containing about 200mg/kg AMF) was administered to Balb/c white mice fasted for 12 hours to perfuse the stomach, and 4 hours after the lavage, the animals were anesthetized and given an X-ray irradiation of 12Gy (dose rate= 8.415 Gy/min) to the abdomen. The control was given equal amounts of distilled water, SP and AMF, respectively. Animals were euthanized 3 days after irradiation, small intestine tissues were taken for pathological sections, immunohistochemical (Ki 67) staining was performed, and the extent of short-term radiation injury (proliferation crypt) of the small intestine was evaluated (fig. 9). 30 days after irradiation, small intestine tissues were taken to prepare pathological sections, and Masson's trichrome staining was performed (fig. 10), and the degree of long-term radiation injury (fibrosis) of the small intestine was evaluated; after removal of a portion of the small intestine tissue, a tissue homogenate was prepared and the contents of inflammatory factors IL-1. Beta., IL-6 and TNF-. Alpha.therein were examined (Elisa kit, boster Biological Technology Co. Itd) (FIGS. 11,12, 13). The results show that the duodenum, jejunum and ileum of the SP@AMF group all keep the crypt proliferation activity similar to that of the normal, the advanced fibrosis degree is light, the inflammatory factor level is low, and each index is obviously superior to other treatment groups including the AMF group, so that the medicine compound obviously improves the radiation protection effect of the AMF on intestinal tissues.</p>EXAMPLE 6 Effect of drug Complex on tumor killing Effect in radiotherapy</p>To further simulate the clinical course of tumor radiation therapy, a cecum in situ colon cancer animal model was constructed, followed by administration of radioprotection drug complexes for oral and abdominal radiation therapy: the CT26-luci colon cancer cells transfected by luciferase are inoculated to the cecal intestinal wall of Balb/c n",

Animals were euthanized 3 days after irradiation, small intestine tissues were taken for pathological sections, immunohistochemical (Ki 67) staining was performed, and the extent of short-term radiation injury (proliferation crypt) of the small intestine was evaluated. 30 days after irradiation, taking small intestine tissues to prepare pathological sections, performing Masson's trichrome staining, and evaluating the degree of long-term radiation injury (fibrosis) of the small intestine; after taking out part of the small intestine tissue, preparing into tissue homogenate, and detecting the content of inflammatory factors IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha. The result shows that the nano material has a certain protective effect (about 50% of the normal control group) on the crypt proliferation activity of the proximal end (duodenum) of the small intestine, but has weaker protective effect on the jejunum and ileum at the middle and distal ends of the small intestine, the number of surviving crypts is only about 20% of that of the normal control, and other indexes such as the late fibrosis degree and the 3 inflammatory factor levels all show similar rules. The above results indicate that although the nano-drug has a certain preventive effect on radiation enteritis, the protective effect is not ideal and the whole length of the small intestine cannot be covered.</p>The above examples and comparative examples are only for illustrating the present invention and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.
