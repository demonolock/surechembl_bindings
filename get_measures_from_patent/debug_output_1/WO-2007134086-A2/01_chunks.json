Biochem. 64:763-797 (1995).</p>[0033] Inhibitors of GSL synthesis enzymes used in the methods of the invention may be competitive or noncompetitive inhibitors. Competitive inhibitors include substrate analogs (including analogs of a portion of a substrate) which bind to the active site of the enzyme of interest and thereby prevent substrate binding. An inhibitor may inhibit an enzyme with an IC50 of, for example, less than 200, 150, 100, 75, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, 5, 3, 2, or 1 \u03bcM. In certain embodiments, an inhibitor may inhibit an enzyme with an IC50 of less than 1 \u03bcM, such as, for example, less than 750, 500, 400, 300, 200, 100 nM. In other embodiments, an inhibitor may inhibit an enzyme with an IC50 of, for example, less than 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 nM.</p>[0034] Inhibitors of GSL synthesis enzymes used in the methods of the invention include, e.g., tamoxifen, mifepristone, imino sugars (such as, e.g., \u039b/-butyldeoxynojirimycin and \u039b/-buyldeoxygalactonojirimycin), \"P-drugs\" (such as, e.g., D,L-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP) and analogs thereof, (R,R)-(D-threo)1 -phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1 -propanol, D-threo-4'-hydroxy-1 -phenyl-2-palmitoylamino-2-pyrrolidino-1 -propanol, D-threo-4'- hydroxy-1 -phenyl-2-palmitoylamino-2-pyrrolidino-1 -propanol, \n\nD,L-threo-1 -phenyl^-hexadecanoylamino-S-morpholino-i -propanol, and D-threo-1 -(3',4'-ethylenedioxy)phenyl-2-palmitoylamino-3-pyrrolidine-1 -propanol, and anti-androgens, which are inhibitors of giucosylceramide synthesis include. In certain embodiments, the inhibitor of giucosylceramide synthase is not PDMP. Inhibitors of GSL synthesis enzymes further include inhibitors of GM1 synthesis such as, e.g., tunicamycin. Inhibitors of GSL synthesis enzymes further include inhibitors of GM2 synthesis such as, e.g., tunicamycin. Yusuf et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80:7075-7079 (1983). Inhibitors of GSL synthesis enzymes also include inhibitors of GM3 synthesis including, e.g., antisense-type inhibitors (see, e.g., Deng et al., Glycobiology 12:145-152 (2002)). Inhibitors of GSL synthesis enzymes further include sialyltransf erase inhibitors suc"
