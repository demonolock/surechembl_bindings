These compounds appear to inhibit glutamate responses by binding to an allosteric site other than the glutamate binding site. The response of mGluR2 to a concentration of glutamate is decreased when compounds of Formula (I) are present. Compounds of Formula (I) are expected to have their effect substantially at mGluR2 by virtue of their ability to reduce the function of the receptor. The effects of negative allosteric modulators tested at mGluR2 using the [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP\u03b3S binding assay method described below and which is suitable for the identification of such compounds, and more particularly the compounds according to Formula (I), are shown in Table 5.</p>1) [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP\u03b3S Binding Assay</p>The [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP\u03b3S binding assay is a functional membrane-based assay used to study G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) function whereby incorporation of a non-hydrolysable form of GTP, [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP\u03b3S (guanosine 5\u2032-triphosphate, labelled with gamma-emitting <sup>35</sup>S), is measured. The G-protein a subunit catalyzes the exchange of guanosine 5\u2032-diphosphate (GDP) by guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and on activation of the GPCR by an agonist, [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP\u03b3S, becomes incorporated and cannot be cleaved to continue the exchange cycle (Harper (1998) Current Protocols in Pharmacology 2.6.1-10, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.). The amount of radioactive [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP\u03b3S incorporation is a direct measure of the activity of the G-protein and hence the activity of the antagonist can be determined. mGlu2 receptors are shown to be preferentially coupled to G\u03b1i-protein, a preferential coupling for this method, and hence it is widely used to study receptor activation of mGlu2 receptors both in recombinant cell lines and in tissues. Here we describe the use of the [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP\u03b3S binding assay using membranes from cells transfected with the human mGlu2 receptor and adapted from Schaffhauser et al. (Molecular Pharmacology, 2003, 4:798-810) for the detection of the negative allosteric modulation (NAM) properties of the compounds of this invention.</p>Membrane Preparation</p>CHO-cells were cultured to pre-confluence and stimulated with 5 mM butyrate for 24 h. Cells were then collected by scraping in PBS and cell suspension was centrifuged (10 min at 4000 RPM in benchtop centrifuge). Supematant was discarded and pellet gently resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 by mixing with an Ultra Turrax homogenizer. The suspension was centrifuged at 12,400 RPM (Sorvall F14S-6x250Y) for 10 minutes and the supernatant discarded. The pellet was homogenized in 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 using an Ultra Turrax homogenizer and centrifuged again (13,000 RPM, 20 min, 4\u00b0 C.). The final pellet was resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. in appropriate aliquots before use. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad, USA) with bovine serum albumin as standard.</p>[<sup>35</sup>S]GTP \u03b3S Binding Assay</p>Measurement of mGluR2 negative allosteric modulatory activity of test compounds was performed as follows. Test compounds and glutamate were diluted in assay buffer containing 10 mM HEPES acid, 10 mM HEPES salt, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>and 10 \u03bcM GDP. Human mGlu2 receptor-containing membranes were thawed on ice and diluted in assay buffer supplemented with 18 \u03bcg/ml saponin. Membranes were pre-incubated with compound together with a predefined (\u02dcEC<sub>80</sub>) concentration of glutamate (60 \u03bcM) for 30 min at 30\u00b0 C. After addition of [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP\u03b3S (f.c. 0.1 nM), assay mixtures were shaken briefly and further incubated to allow [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP\u03b3S incorporation on activation (30 minutes, 30\u00b0 C.). Final assay mixtures contained 7 \u03bcg of membrane protein in 10 mM HEPES acid, 10 mM HEPES salt, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 \u03bcM GDP and 10 \u03bcg/ml saponin. Total reaction volume was 200 \u03bcl. Reactions were terminated by rapid filtration through Unifilter-96 GF/B plates (Perkin Elmer, Massachusetts, USA) using a 96-well filtermate universal harvester. Filters were washed 6 times with ice-cold 10 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>/10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.4. Filters were then air-dried, and 30 \u03bcl of liquid scintillation cocktail (Microscint-O) was added to each well. Membrane-bound radioactivity was counted in a Topcount.</p>Data Analysis</p>The concentration-response curves of representative compounds of the prese"
