The binding affinity (Ki) of the compounds according to the present invention for the \u03b13 subunit of the human GABAA receptor is conveniently as measured in the assay described hereinbelow. The \u03b13 subunit binding affinity (Ki) of the compounds of the invention is ideally 10 nM or less, preferably 2 nM or less, and more preferably 1 nM or less. The compounds according to the present invention will ideally elicit at least a 40%, preferably at least a 50%, and more preferably at least a 60%, potentiation of the GABA EC20 response in stably transfected recombinant cell lines expressing the \u03b13 subunit of the human GABAA receptor. Moreover, the compounds of the invention will ideally elicit at most a 30%, preferably at most a 20%, and more preferably at most a 10%, potentiation of the GABA EC20 response in stably transfected recombinant cell lines expressing the \u03b1l subunit of the human GABAA receptor.</p>\n  The potentiation of the GABA EC20 response in stably transfected cell lines expressing the \u03b13 and \u03b1l subunits of the human GABAA receptor can conveniently be measured by procedures analogous to the protocol described in Wafford et al, Mol. Pharmacol, 1996, 50, 670-678. The \n\nprocedure will suitably be carried out utilising cultures of stably transfected eukaryotic cells, typically of stably transfected mouse Ltk- fib rob last cells.</p>\n  The compounds according to the present invention exhibit anxiolytic activity, as may be demonstrated by a positive response in the elevated plus maze and conditioned suppression of drinking tests (cf. Dawson et al., Psychopharmacology, 1995, 121, 109-117). Moreover, the compounds of the invention are substantially non-sedating, as may be confirmed by an appropria",
    "from cells. PBS (approximately 20 ml) is added. The cells are scraped and placed in a 50 ml centrifuge tube. The procedure is repeated with a further 10 ml of PBS to ensure that most of the cells are removed. The cells are pelleted by centrifuging for 20 min at 3000 rpm in a benchtop centrifuge, and then frozen if desired. The pellets are resuspended in 10 ml of buffer per tray (25 cm x 25 cm) of cells.</p>\n  Assay Can be carried out in deep 96-well plates or in tubes. Each tube contains:</p>\n  \u2022 300 \u03bcl of assay buffer.</p>\n  \u2022 50 \u03bcl of [<sup>3</sup>H]-flumazenil (final concentration for \u03b1l\u03b23\u03b32: 1.8 nM; for \u03b12\u03b23\u03b32: 1.8 nM; for \u03b13\u03b23\u03b32: 1.0 nM). \u2022 50 \u03bcl of buffer or solvent carrier (e.g. 10% DMSO) if compounds are dissolved in 10% DMSO (total); test compound or flunitrazepam (to determine non-specific binding), 10 \u03bcM final concentration.</p>\n  \u2022 100 \u03bcl of cells.</p>\n  Assays are incubated for 1 hour at 40\u00b0C, then filtered using either a Tomtec or Brandel cell harvester onto GF/B filters followed by 3 x 3 ml washes with ice cold assay buffer. Filters are dried and counted by liquid scintillation counting. Expected values for total binding are 3000-4000 dpm for total counts and less than 200 dpm for non-specific binding if using liquid scintillation counting, or 1500-2000 dpm for total counts and less than 200 dpm for non-specific binding if counting with meltilex solid scintillant. Binding parameters are determined by non-linear least squares regression analysis, from which the inhibition constant Ki can be calculated for each test compound.</p>\n  The compounds of the accompanying Examples were tested in the above assay, and all were found to possess a Ki value for displacement of \n\n[<sup>3</sup>H]-flumazenil from the \u03b12 and/or \u03b13 subunit of the human GABAA receptor of 100 nM or less.</p>\n  EXAMPLE 1</p>\n  7-(Bicvclor2.2.nhe<sup>p</sup>t-l-yl)-6-(2-methyl-2H-1.2.4-triazol-3-ylmethoxy)-3- phenyl- 1.2, 4-triazolo \\4.3- frlp yridazine</p>\n  a) 4- (Bicvclo \\2.2.11 hep t- 1 - yl) - 3.6- dichlorop yridazine Concentrated sulphuric acid (2.17ml, 40mM) was added carefully to a suspension of 3, 6-dichlorop vridazine (2.11g, 14.3mM) in water (50ml). This mixture was then heated to 70\u00b0C and bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-l- carboxylic acid (Org. Synth., 59, 85; 2.0g, 14.3mM) was added. After ten minutes a solution of silver nitrate (0.48g, 2.8mM) in water (5ml) was added dropwise over two minutes. A solution of ammonium persulphate (9.8g, 43mM) in water (20ml) was added over 20 minutes. The reaction was heated at 70\u00b0C for a further 40 minutes and then allowed to cool to room temperature. The mixture was poured onto ice and basified with concentrated aqueous ammonia; the temperature was kept below 10\u00b0C by addition of more ice. The aqueous phase was extracted with dichloromethane (3 x 200ml) and the combined extracts were dried (MgSO ), filtered and evaporated to give the crude product, which was purified by column chromatography using ethyl acetate/hexane mixtures as the eluent to give the title compound (3.4g). \u0397 NMR (250 MHz, CDC1<sub>3</sub>) \u03b4 1.49-2.00 (8H, m), 2.17 (2H, m), 2.43 (IH, m), 7.45 (IH, s); MS (ES<sup>+</sup>) m/e 244 [MH]Z</p>\n"
