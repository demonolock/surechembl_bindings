    ". The samples were mixed and hydrolyses of the chromogenic substrate Z-D-Arg-Gly-Arg-pNA (S-2765), thus liberating the chromophoric group pNA (p-nitroaniline), was monitored at 405 nm. The samples were mixed every 30 seconds to maintain a uniform mixture. ThermoLabsystems Multiskan Spectrum spectrophotometer was used to measure the absorbance spectrums. The increase in absorbance was proportional to the enzyme (factor Xa) activity. The % inhibition of factor Xa was determined using a standard curve. Results are depicted in Table 7. A bar graph also illustrating the percent inhibition is presented in Figure 2.\nTable 7. % FactorXa Inhibition: Single concentration (10 ug/ml)Compound #% InhibitionCompound #% Inhibition916.246898472501020.801468342648.14324111.903402332278.885942129.3810543492844.297081336.844430853049.96431121241.8354236773175.45630672539.7675133223.11274261959.821216143332.01794636155.7102069953499.996601071440.991128793762.404405021715.023282693579.603004661813.255837673865.05557255122.296998743956.49026206241.05910744417.81754529140.9517011664659.1414295932.8551034984279.4670473562.5831888794359.6852588375.5062710314577.8355596387.4096733634474.36864824910.876584755245.47772207.8515346185343.03048843211.4955304035419.98572448221.2915944395548.49739882231.223615785Magainin4.4186125561630.38645865Magainin-T23.1127426</p>As illustrated in Figure 2 and Table 7 above, the polycationic compounds of the present invention inhibited Factor Xa.</p>Factor Xa Inhibition: EC50. To determine the concentration of polycationic compound that causes about 50% lysis of human red blood cells, fixed heparin concentrations were used and different amounts of heparin antagonists were added.
