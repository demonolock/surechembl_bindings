    "ials and held at 40\u00b0 C. for 2 months or lyophilized and held at 40\u00b0 C. for 6 months.</p>As shown in FIG. 3A, BMP-7 formulations containing lactate with methionine and glycylglycine had the lowest aggregation rates for those formulation buffers at 1 mg/mL at 6 months. As shown in FIG. 3B, at 16 mg/mL, there was an increase observed in protein aggregation for all buffers tested. The lowest aggregation was seen in the formulation containing tartrate. The example demonstrated improved stability associated with BMP-7 formulations containing 10 mM glycylglycine, 9% trehalose, pH 3.0 and BMP-7 formulations containing 10 mM tartrate, 9% trehalose, pH 3.0 compared to formulations containing 10 mM lactate.</p>Example 4BMPs from Glycylglycine and Tartaric Acid Buffer Formulations have Biological ActivityThe ability of BMP from a solution of BMP and glycylglycine buffer or tartaric acid buffer that has been held at 40\u00b0 C. for 6 months to induce alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in the rat osteosarcoma cell line ROS 17/2.8 is assayed. The exemplary BMP, BMP-7, is tested in a nine point dose response in triplicate. In particular, ROS 17/2.8 cells are plated in 96-well tissue culture plates. BMP from the glycylglycine solution or the tartaric acid solution is added to the cells in the following dosages: 6000, 2000, 666, 222, 74, 24, 8, 2, and 0.9 ng/ml and incubated for a period of 48 hours. Cells are subsequently lysed and potency of BMP-7 to induce ALP activity is assessed based on the EC50 derived from non-linear regression of the mean optical density (OD) of the samples. The exemplary BMP, BMP-7, from the glycylglycine solution and the tartaric acid solution both demonstrate robust biological activity.</p>Example 5BMP Formulations Containing Glycylglycine BufferA formulation according to the invention is prepared by performing a buffer exchange by dialysis, tangential flow filtration, or ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UF/DF) process with BMP, for example BMP-7. 100 mg of BMP-7 in 10 mL of dialysis buffer is dialyzed against 300 mL of 10 mM glycylglycine buffer, 9% trehalose, and 20 mM methionine at pH 3.0\u00b10.2 with 3 changes of dialysis buffer. The glycylglycine buffer is prepared by mixing 500 mL of 10 mM glycylglycine-HCl solution at pH 2.6 with 210 mL of 10 mM glycylglycine at pH 5.7. The resulting concentration of BMP-7 is adjusted to 1 mg/mL (about 100 mL) using dialysis buffer and 0.01% polysorbate 20 or 0.01% polysorbate 80 is added with a final pH of 3.0\u00b10.2. Similarly, about 100 mg to 10 g of BMP-7 in about 10 mL to 1000 mL dialysis buffer is exchanged against about 10\u00d7 volume of 10 mM glycylglycine buffer via UF/DF. Additional formulation constituents, such as trehalose, methionine, and/or polysorbate 20 are spiked in to desired amounts. The formulation is diluted to the desired concentration using the formulation buffer and the final formulation pH is 3.0\u00b10.2.</p>Example 6BMP Formulations Containing Tartaric Acid BufferA formulation according to"
