{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nThe exemplary BMP, BMP-7, from the glycylglycine solution and the tartaric acid solution both demonstrate robust biological activity with an EC50 of 10 ng/ml.\n\n\nNo other sentences met the criteria, as they either lacked a specific numeric value, unit, or bioactivity metric. However, I can try to re-examine the text to see if any other information can be extracted.\n\n\nAfter re-examining the text, I found another sentence that meets the criteria:\n\n\nBMP from the glycylglycine solution or the tartaric acid solution is added to the cells in the following dosages: 6000, 2000, 666, 222, 74, 24, 8, 2, and 0.9 ng/ml and incubated for a period of 48 hours, and the EC50 is derived from non-linear regression of the mean optical density (OD) of the samples.\n\n\nHowever, this sentence does not explicitly state the EC50 value. Therefore, I will not include it in the final list.\n\n\nThe final list remains:\n\n\nThe exemplary BMP, BMP-7, from the glycylglycine solution and the tartaric acid solution both demonstrate robust biological activity with an EC50 of 10 ng/ml.\n\n\nNote that the sentence I extracted does not exactly match the format you requested, as it does not explicitly state the unit \"ng/ml\" for the EC50 value in the same sentence. However, I can try to rephrase it to match the format:\n\n\nBMP-7 has an EC50 of 10 ng/ml.\n\n\nPlease let me know if this meets your requirements."}
