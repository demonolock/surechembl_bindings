    "d mammalian cells, for example, myeloma cells of rat, mouse, bovine or human origin. The hybridoma cells are cultured in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of unfused, immortalized cells. For example, if the parental cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine .phosphoribos3'l transferase (HGPRT), thexulture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT), substances which prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells. Preferred immortalized cell lines are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high level production of antibody, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. More preferred immortalized cell lines are murine or human myeloma lines, which can be obtained, for example, from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Rockville, MD. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies, e.g. Kozbor, J. Immunol. 133:3001 (1984); Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, pp. 51-63 (1987).</p>\n  The culture medium (supernatant) in which the hybridoma cells are cultured can be assayed for the presence of monoclonal antibodies directed against an NDTP. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies present in the hybridoma supernatant is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radio\u00ac immunoassay (RIA) or Enzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA). Appropriate techniques and assays are known in the art. The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can, for example, be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson and Pollard, Anal. Biochem. 107:220 (1980). After the desired antibody-producing hybridoma cells are identified, the cells may be cloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (Goding, 1986, supra). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium and RPMI-1640 medium. Alternatively, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites in a mammal. The monoclonal antibodies secreted by selected clones may be isolated or purified from the culture medium or ascites fluid by immunoglobulin purification procedures routinely used by those of skill in the art such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxyl-apatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography. The -monoclonal antibodies may also be made- by recombinant DNA methods, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567. DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies of the \n\ninvention can be isolated from the NDTP-specific hybridoma cells and sequenced, e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies. Once isolated, the DNA may be inserted into an expression vector, whi",
    " of immunoglobulins which are capable of specifically binding to NDTPs.</p>\n  NDTP antibodies may be used as functional modulators, most commonly as antagonists. Preferably, antibody modulators of the invention are derived from monoclonal antibodies specific for NDTPs. Monoclonal antibodies capable of blocking, or neutralizing, NDTPs are generally selected by their ability to inhibit an NDTP biological activity. The use of antibody fragments is also well known, e.g. Fab fragments: Tijssen,</p>\n  Practice and Theory of Enzyme Immunoassays (Elsevier, Amsterdam, 1985); and Fv fragments: Hochman et al. Biochemistry, Vol. 12, pgs. 1130-1135 (1973), Sharon et al., Biochemistry, Vol. 15, pgs. 1591-1594 (1976) and Ehrlich et al., U.S. Patent 4,355,023; and antibody half molecules: Auditore- Hargreaves, U.S. Patent 4,470,925. Preferably, monoclonal-antibodies, Fv fragments^ Fab fragments, or other binding compositions derived from monoclonal antibodies of the invention have a high affinity to \n\nNDTPs. The affinity of monoclonal antibodies and related molecules to NDTPs may be measured by conventional techniques including plasmon resonance, ELISA, or equilibrium dialysis. Affinity measurement by plasmon resonance techniques may be carried out, for example, using a BIAcore 2000 instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) in accordance with the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Preferably, affinity is measured by ELISA, as described in U.S. patent 6,235,883, for example. Preferably, the dissociation constant between NDTPs and monoclonal antibodies of the invention is less than 10<sup>\"5</sup> molar. More preferably, such dissociation constant is less than 10<sup>'8</sup> molar; still more preferably, such dissociation constant is less than 10<sup>'9</sup> molar; and most preferably, such dissociation constant is in the range of 10<sup>\"9</sup> to 10<sup>\"1</sup> ' molar.</p>\n  In addition, the antibodies of the present invention are useful for detecting NDTPs. The antibodies of the invention may be used in most assays involving antigen-antibody reactions. The assays may be homogeneous or heterogeneous. In a homogeneous assay approach, the sample can be a biological sample or fluid such as serum, urine, whole blood, lymphatic fluid, plasma, saliva, cells, tissue, and material secreted by cells or tissues cultured in vitro. The sample can be pretreated if necessary to remove unwanted materials. The immunological reaction usually involves the specific antibody, a labeled analyte, and the sample suspected of containing the antigen. The signal arising from the label is modified, directly or indirectly, upon the binding of the antibody to the labeled analyte. Both immunological reaction and detection of the extent thereof are carried out in a homogeneous solution. Immunochemical labels which may be employed include free radicals, fluorescent dyes, enzymes, bacteriophages, coenzymes, and so forth.</p>\n  In a heterogeneous assay approach, the reagents are usually the sample, the specific antibody, and means for producing a detectable signal. The specimen is generally placed on a support, such as a plate or a slide, and contacted with the antibody in a liquid phase. The support is then separated from the liquid phase and either the support phase or the liquid phase is"
