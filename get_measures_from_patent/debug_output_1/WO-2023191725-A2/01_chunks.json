    "t a final concentration of 0.001 %. Upon addition of methylene blue, all vials were tightly closed and incubated at 37 \u00b0C in a hypoxic jar. Oxygen in the jar was removed by Anaerobic atmosphere Generation (AnaeroGen) sachet. The dye decolorizes when the oxygen in the culture is used up. The color changes and the differences in the exponentially growing cultures and broth reflect the relative oxygen consumption, thus indirectly indicate the respiration of each culture. </p>Assay for ATP-driven proton translocation </p>ATP-driven proton translocation into IMV\u2019s of M. smegmatis was measured by a decrease of 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine (ACMA) fluorescence using a Cary Eclipse Fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian Inc., Palo Alto) according to Haagsma, A.C. et al., FEMS microbiology letters, 2010, 313, 68-74. IMV\u2019s (0.18 mg per ml) were preincubated at 37 \u00b0C in 10 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 100 mM KCI, 5 mM MgCI<sub>2</sub> containing 2 pM ACMA and a baseline was monitored for 5 min. The reaction was started by adding 2 mM ATP, or 2 mM NADH. After about 8 min, any proton gradient was collapsed by the addition of 2 pM of the uncoupler SF6847. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 410 nm and 480 nm, respectively. </p>Results and discussion </p>As shown by the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC50) of 6.8 pM (FIG. 2A), GaMF1.39 is a comparably efficacious inhibitor of M. bovis BCG and Mtb (3.0 pM) (Hotra, A. et al., Angewandte Chemie Int. Ed. 2020, 59, 13295-13304). The IC50 of 3.3 pM measured for intracellular ATP inhibition of M. bovis BCG (FIG. 2B) was consistent with the determined \n\nMICso and indicates that ATP formation, mainly synthesized by OXPHOS, is affected by the compound. NADH-driven ATP synthesis of IMVs of M. bovis BCG and M. smegmatis was inhibited at an IC50 of 51.6 \u00b1 1.35 nM and 90 \u00b1 1.1 nM (Hotra, A. et al., Angewandte Chemie Int. Ed. 2020, 59, 13295-13304), respectively. In comparison, GaMF1.39 reduced ATP synthesis of IMVs in the presence of succinate with a similar IC50 = 71 nM (FIG. 2C), indicating that the compound does not interfere with NADH-dehydrogenases. Oxygen consumption within the respiratory chain of M. bovis BCG is unaffected at 7 pM of GaMF1.39 (FIG. 2D), and GaMF1.39 lacked the ability to induce uncoupled proton pumping (FIG. 2E) unlike the known uncoupler SF6847, underscoring that GaMF1.39 does not induce an increase in respiration as described for the anti-TB drug BDQ (Lamprecht, D. A. et al., Nat. Commun. 2016, 7, 12393). In addition, we tested the potency of GaMF1.39 against M. smegmatis IMVs bearing an I66M substitution in subunit c, which is associated with resistance to BDQ (Kundu, S. (2017) Bedaquiline targets the epsilon subunit of mycobacterial F-ATP synthase. PhD thesis, National University of Singapore). I66M mutant IMVs displayed a 10-fold shift in sensitivity to BDQ with an IC50 value of 1 nM in comparison to WT (IC50 value of 0.14 nM) (FIG. 2F), whereas the mutation did not affect the potency of GaMF1 .39, indicated by the IC50 value of 64 nM. These data demonstrate that GaMF1 .39 shows no cross resistance to BDQ. </p>Since GaMF1.39 lacked the ability to induce uncoupled proton pumping (FIG. 2E) and does not alter the membrane potential, we reconstituted the recombinant /WsF-ATP synthase into proteoliposomes to confirm that this molecular engine is indeed the target of the molecule. The advantage of this reconstitution design for compound screening lies not only in its efficiency but also in the fact that it does not need a second proton-motive force generating enzyme, essential for target characterization. The reconstituted /WsF-ATP synthase had an ATP synthesis activity of 35.2 \u00b1 2.3 nmol min<sup>-1</sup> (mg protein)<sup>-1</sup> (FIG. 2G). When the control compound BDQ was used at its IC50 concentration determined in IMVs (FIG. 2G), a -51 % inhibition was observed, confirming that the engine is indeed BDQ\u2019s target, suggesting that the assay is a useful tool for demonstrating compound target specificity. Similarly, when GaMF1.39 was tested against the reconstituted /WsF-ATP synthase at its IC50 concentration, a 42% inhibition (20.5 \u00b1 2.6 nmol min<sup>-1</sup> (mg protein)<sup>-1</sup>) was calculated (FIG. 2G) and increasing the amount of GaMF1.39 resulted in a clear concentration dependent inhibition of the enzyme, underlining that the compound targets the enzyme. </p>Example 2.
