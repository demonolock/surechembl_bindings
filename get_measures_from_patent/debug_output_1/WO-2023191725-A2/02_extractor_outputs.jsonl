{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\nAs shown by the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC50) of 6.8 pM (FIG. 2A), GaMF1.39 is a comparably efficacious inhibitor of M. bovis BCG and Mtb (3.0 pM) (Hotra, A. et al., Angewandte Chemie Int. Ed. 2020, 59, 13295-13304).\nThe IC50 of 3.3 pM measured for intracellular ATP inhibition of M. bovis BCG (FIG. 2B) was consistent with the determined \nNADH-driven ATP synthesis of IMVs of M. bovis BCG and M. smegmatis was inhibited at an IC50 of 51.6 \u00b1 1.35 nM and 90 \u00b1 1.1 nM (Hotra, A. et al., Angewandte Chemie Int. Ed. 2020, 59, 13295-13304), respectively.\nIn comparison, GaMF1.39 reduced ATP synthesis of IMVs in the presence of succinate with a similar IC50 = 71 nM (FIG. 2C), indicating that the compound does not interfere with NADH-dehydrogenases.\nI66M mutant IMVs displayed a 10-fold shift in sensitivity to BDQ with an IC50 value of 1 nM in comparison to WT (IC50 value of 0.14 nM) (FIG. 2F), whereas the mutation did not affect the potency of GaMF1 .39, indicated by the IC50 value of 64 nM."}
