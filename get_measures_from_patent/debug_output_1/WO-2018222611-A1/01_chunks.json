    "nchymal stem cell, a human iPS -derived </p>photoreceptor cell, a human iPS-derived neural stem cell, a human iPS-derived microglia, and a human iPS-derived pericyte. </p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES </p> Figure 1 shows the terms, structures, classifications and rational for visible light photoinitiation reagent selection. </p> Figure 2 shows OPA detection of supernatant and incorporated peptide CL for visible light. Red corresponds to high CL detected and high concentration level of reagent. </p> Figure 3 (right top) shows a schematic diagram that depicts competing interactions between interfaces that contribute to meniscus formation. Figure 3 (bottom) shows a schematic diagram that depicts changes in wall geometry that influence meniscus shape. Resulting flatness of 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and \u0399\u03bc\u03af UV hydrogel formulations are shown in a Greiner LoBase 384 well plate (that is, a low wall steepness plate). The red box indicates the volume that reproducibly covered the well bottom and resulted in flat hydrogels. </p> Figure 4 shows a visible light gel tubulogenesis assay. The center point and the low point conditions for SPS and RUBPY3 were tested with varied cell density. The low center point condition had superior performance and was selected. An optimum cell density between 3900 and 5500 (for example, 4500 cells per 384 well) was selected for future studies. </p> Figure 5 shows a FIJI automated tubulogenesis schematic. The steps were recorded into a macro, and batch-executed on IC50 experiment files. \n\n Figures 6-9 show IC50 images, resulting curves, and Z' scores for human vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) and iCell-EC tubulogenesis in the presence of Axitinib and Sunitinib on UV and visible light-photoinitiated gels. </p> Figure 10 (left) shows schematic diagrams of two strategies for conjugating thin hydrogels onto tissue culture-treated polystyrene. Figure 10 (right) shows Ellman's assay on overnight Traut's reagent treatment of tissue culture-treated polystyrene. </p> Figure 11 shows control experiments with evidence of gel cross-linking directly to the surface. Untreated tissue culture polystyrene was incubated with visible light photoinitiated hydrogel precursor solutions lacking a reagent as described. The wells were then exposed to white visible light (lamp) for lOmin and then incubated for 1 hr. in PBS. CellMASK-labeled HUVECs were seeded at 5000 cells per well and then imaged after 24hrs. \"Ligand\" denotes the presence of cysteine terminated RGD peptide for cell attachment. \"Initiator\" denotes the presence of the sodium persulfate photoinitiator. </p> Figure 12 shows RGD ligands with different cross-linkers for thin hydrogels. The red box indicates a concentration region tubule formation that was selected for further </p>experimentation. </p> Figure 13 shows titration of RGD ligands with peptide cross-linkers at different ratios to PEG-NB. The highest concentration of RGD for 60mg/mL PEG-NB to 4mM thiol concentration from cross-linker resulted in tubules with preferred morphology,",
    "the VEGF inhibitors Sunitinib and Axitinib. (Figure 4.) </p> To compare the capacity for tubulogenesis, a visible light cross-linked hydrogel that appeared comparable to the UV cross-linked hydrogels was identifed. The SPS:RuBPY<sub>3</sub> ratio was maintained and high (00) and low (\u2014 ) concentration conditions were compared. The cell seeding density (1400-5500 cells/well) was also varied. The (-) condition produced improved endothelial cell attachment and more consistent endothelial networks than the (00) condition. The most consistent endothelial networks were observed between the 3900 and 5500 cells/well. </p> To quantitatively compare tubulogenesis a method of image analysis was generated wherein the images were optimized by creating a binary background subtraction, the binary was closed to eliminate artifacts from the binary mask creation, and then the networks were skeletonized. (Figure 5.) The total skeleton length and average length were then output to Excel for each image in order to compare total tubulogenesis per well, and characteristic features of the tubules (for example, whether there were either more or less tubules, or whether there were equivalent tubules, with one condition having tubules of longer length). This analysis method generated comparable results to an approach based on thresholding of individual images using previous data, and generating IC50s curves for Sunitinib inhibition of tubulogenesis. 384 well Greiner LoBase plates were used to generate IC50 as well as Z' scores for UV and visible light cross-linked gels with both HUVECs and iCell-ECs. With both photoinitiation schemes an increase in inhibitors decreased the observed total tubule length. (Figures 6, 7, 8 and 9.) </p>Example 3- Thin hydrogel coatings </p> In this experimental example, very thin (10's to 100' s of nm) hydrogels were directly conjugated to the surface of tissue culture polystyrene to take advantage of the observation that HUVEC seeding on non-treated tissue culture polystyrene resulted in transient and unstable endothelial networks that resembled tubules. In this approach the substrate was pegylated first, \n\n and substrate interactions are blocked thereby allowing only for cellular interactions. Then, increasing concentrations of cell adhesion peptides were added to tune the balance of cell- substrate interactions to stabilize tubules for an appropriate time frame before angiogenesis assays were performed (24-36 hrs). The thin hydrogel coatings of the present disclosure may be manufactured and sent as dry plate. RUBPY3 photoinitiation was used because it is compatible with plate manufacturing in ambient light compared manufacturing that requires UV light exposure, and to take advantage of direct conjugation to phenolic residues on tissue culture- treated polystyrene. </p> Two options for direct conjugation with the thin hydrogel approach were tested i.e., 1) using the phenolic residues for direct conjugation via RUBPY3, or 2) first generating f"
