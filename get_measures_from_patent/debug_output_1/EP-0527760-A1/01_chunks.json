    "ematic representation of the HIV-1 glycoprotein precursor, gp160, and the two variant gpl 60 derived proteins, rgpl 20, and sgpl 60, used in the present study. Both proteins differ at the amino terminus from wild-type gp160. In the rgpl 20 protein, the signal sequence and 31 residues of gp160 have been replaced with the signal sequence and 25 amino acids from the mature N-terminus of herpes simplex virus type 1 glycoprotein D (HSV-1 gD)<sup>3</sup>. In the sgpl 60 protein, the signal sequence and 12 amino acids of gp160 have been replaced with the signal sequence and 9 amino acids from the mature N-terminus of HSV-1 gD. In addition, the normal gpl 20/gp41 proteolytic processing site has been removed by a deletion spanning amino acid residues 502-51 1 .</p>FIGURE 3B depicts silver-stained SDS-PAGE gel of purified rgpl 20 and sgpl 60 under reducing and non-reducing conditions. Both recombinant glycoproteins were purified from growth conditioned cell culture supernatants by immunoaffinity chromatography and gel permeation chromatography to greater than 99% purity for rgp120 and greater than 95% purity for sgpl 60. Under non-reducing conditions the rgpl 20 contained less than 5% dimer while the sgpl 60 was approximately 50% dimer and higher order oligomers. Both proteins are subject to an endoproteolytic cleavage between arginine residue 315 and alanine residue 316 in the V3 region of the gp120 portion of each molecule. In rgp120 this results in the formation of an N-terminal 75 kD fragment and a 50 kD C-terminal fragment, while in sgp160 the same cleavage results in two fragments both of approximately 75 kD. On</p>SDS-PAGE the fragments are visible only under reducing conditions because of disulfide bonding between cysteine residues 296 and 331 . The rgp120 preparation contained less than 5 % of the cleaved form whereas approximately 40% of the sgp160 was cleaved.</p>FIGURE 4 shows the results of an immunoblot depicting the cross reactivity of the antibodies of this invention with other isolates of HIV-1 besides IIIB.</p>FIGURE 5 is an autoradiograph showing analysis of ten monoclonal antibodies to sgpl 60.

Chimpanzees were immunized with 300 \u03bcg per dose of rgp160 (x-247 and x-261 ), rgp120 (x262 and x-265) or herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D (x-246), at times 0, 4 weeks, and 32 weeks (arrows). All immunogens were incorporated in aluminum hydroxide adjuvant containing 2 mg equivalents of Al<sup>+3</sup> per mg of protein. Blood was taken at the time points indicated, and the sera were analyzed for antibodies to rgpl 20 or sgpl 60 in the assays described for the in each of the specific panel descriptions.

The sgp160 protein is a variant of gpl 60 wherein the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail have been deleted to enable the protein to be \n\n secreted from mammalian cells. Both proteins are glycosyiated in a manner similar to authentic viral gp120, and bind to CD4, the cellular receptor for HIV-1 , with high affinity. The immunogens used in this study, rgp120 and sgp160, were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using different monoclonal antibodies for each antigen, as described above. Besides the absence of contaminating proteins, a major difference between the gp120 used in this study and previous studies is that the present study used gpl 20 which was not proteolyzed. Evaluation of material used in previous studies shows that approximately 50 % of the gp120 in recombinant preparations was proteolytically clipped at amino acid 315 to yield peptides that migrated on SDS PAGE gels with mobilities of 50kd and 75 kd. We have determined that this proteolysis site is located in the middle of a major type- specific neutralizing epitope (shown as IV on Fig. 1 ). In this study, we used undipped gp120, but the sgpl 60 preparation used exhibited approximately 50 % proteolysis at this position.</p>In the present study, two chimpanzees were immunized with the 140-150 kd sgpl 60 protein, and two chimpanzees were immunized with the 120-130 kD rgp120 protein. A placebo control animal was immunized with the same quantity of recombinant glycoprotein D (gD-1 ) of herpes simplex virus type 1 , expressed in mammalian cell culture, purified by a similar procedure as the rgp120 (Berman et al., Science 277:1490-1492 (1985)), and adsorbed onto aluminum gel. Specifically, animals were immunized with 1 ml of a preparation of antigen at a dose of 300 \u03bcg of protein per animal per immunization.</p>All antigens were formulated in an aluminum hydroxide (alum) adjuvant (Berman et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5200-5204 (1988) (0.5 mg/ml of Ah<sup>3</sup>) in phosphate buffered saline (0.016M P0<sub>4</sub> pH 6.2, 0.15M NaCI, 0.004M KCI), the only adjuvant currently approved in the United States for vaccine products. The immunization schedule that we employed was different from all published HIV or</p>SIV vaccine trials, but was similar to that used for the Hepatitis B virus vaccine which was found to give good results in dose interval studies in other primates (Anderson et al., J. Infect. Diseases 160:960-969 (1989). Animals were given a primary immunization with either undipped rgpl 20 or sgp160 at time 0, followed by booster immunizations at four weeks and thirty-two weeks. Test and control preparations were administered intramuscularly in two sites (0.5 ml/site).</p>Blood samples were taken from each animal at bimonthly intervals and analyzed by a number of assays.

DTT was added to yield 100mM final volume, and the samples were dialyzed into ammonium bicarbonate. The proteins were used to coat ELISA plates at 1 .0 \u03bcg/ml, and the MAbs screened in a standard ELISA protocol.</p>Results of the epitope mapping are summarized in Table 3.</p>TABLE 3 *</p></p>* MAbs in italics were raised against gp120. All others were raised against 683\u0394C.7 (gpl 60). \n\n To further explore the specificity of these antibodies, and to control for the possibility that the preferential reactivity to gpl 20 or gpl 60 might represent an artifact peculiar to the ELISA assays, the binding of these antibodies was studied in a liquid phase radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIP). For these experiments rgp120 and sgp160 were metabolically labeled with [<sup>3B</sup>S]-methionine.<sup>'</sup> Both proteins were then mixed together and reacted with the monoclonal antibodies. The resulting antibody antigen complexes were then absorbed to glutaraldehyde fixed S. aureus and the proteins specifically immunoprecipitated were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as previously described. Figure 5 shows an autoradiograph where the ten monoclonal antibodies to sgp160 were analyzed. It can be seen that three major bands were specifically immunoprecipitated by one or more of the sera tested, a 140 kD band corresponding to sgp 160, a 1 10-120 kD band corresponding to rgp120, and a 75 kD band which represents proteolytic breakdown products of gp120 and sgpl 60. Previous studies, described above, have indicated that gpl 20 and sgpl 60 produced in recombinant cell culture are often clipped between amino acid residues 315-316. In the case of gp120, proteolysis at this residue yields an amino-terminal 75 kD fragment and carboxy-terminal 50 kD fragment which is in turn proteoiyzed to smaller fragments. Proteolysis of sgpl 60 at this residue yields two fragments with a 75 kD mobility (gp75a and gp75b). Comparison of the data in Tables 1 and 2 with that in Figure 4 revealed that the RIP data correspond very well with the ELISA data and that the monoclonal antibodies 9E3, 10C1 , 14F12, and 15G7 all were reactive exclusively with gpl 60. This result suggests that those antibodies reacted with epitopes on gp41 or with epitopes dependent on the interaction between gp41 and gpl 20. Thus it is concluded that the selectivity observed could not be attributed to an artifact in the ELISA format. 3. Function of Monoclonal Antibodies. Six of the monoclonal antibodies inhibited the binding of gp120 to the CD4 receptor.</p>Of these six, three were able to neutralize HIV virions as indicated by a reduction of reverse transcriptase activity in vitro. Three other monoclonal antibodies also neutralized infectious virions in the in vitro reverse transcriptase assays. Assays were performed according to the following procedures. 1 . CD4/gp120 binding: Monoclonal antibodies were tested in a solution phase ELISA assay to determine CD4/gp120 blocking ability. ELISA microtiter plates were coated with antibody to CD4 (L104.5) at 1 .0 \u03bcg/ml. In a separate reaction plate, gp160 or 120 antibodies were incubated with soluble rgp120 overnight at 4\u00b0C. Soluble CD4 was added for one hour at room temperature, and the resulting complex was transferred to the L104.5-coated plate. Non-blocked CD4 was detected with a horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated anti-CD4 antibody (Leu3a-HRP). I"
