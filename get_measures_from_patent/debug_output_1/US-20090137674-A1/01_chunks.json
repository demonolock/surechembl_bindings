    "-amino-acid, or glycosyl-amino-acid. A \u201cglycoprotein\u201d is a carbohydrate (e.g., a glycan) covalently linked to a protein. A \u201cglyco-amino-acid\u201d is a carbohydrate (e.g., a saccharide) covalently linked to a single amino acid. A \u201cglycosyl-amino-acid\u201d is a carbohydrate (e.g., a saccharide) linked through a glycosyl linkage (O\u2014, N\u2014, or S\u2014) to an amino acid.</p>A \u201cpeptide\u201d includes a single amino acid, a dipeptide, a tripeptide, an oligopeptide, a polypeptide, or a carrier peptide. An oligopeptide includes from 2 to 70 amino acids.</p>Preferably, the chemical moiety is a peptide, more particularly a single amino acid, a dipeptide, or a tripeptide. The peptide preferably comprises fewer than 70 amino acids, fewer than 50 amino acids, fewer than 10 amino acids, or fewer than 4 amino acids. When the chemical moiety is one or more amino acids, the amphetamine is preferably bound to lysine, serine, phenylalanine, or glycine. In another embodiment, the amphetamine is preferably bound to lysine, glutamic acid, or leucine. In one embodiment, the amphetamine is bound to lysine and optional additional chemical moieties, e.g., additional amino acids. In a preferred embodiment, the amphetamine is bound to a single lysine amino acid.</p>In one embodiment, the chemical moiety is from 1 to 12 amino acids, preferably 1 to 8 amino acids. In another embodiment, the number of amino acids is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. In another embodiment, the molecular weight of the chemical moiety is below about 2,500 kD, more preferably below about 1,000 kD, and most preferably below about 500 kD.</p>Each amino acid can be any one of the L- or D-enantiomers, preferably L-enantiomers, of the naturally occurring amino acids: alanine (Ala or A), arginine (Arg or R), asparagine (Asn or N), aspartic acid (Asp or D), cysteine (Cys or C), glycine (Gly or G), glutamic acid (Glu or E), glutamine (Gln or Q), histidine (His or H), isoleucine (Ile or I), leucine (Leu or L), lysine (Lys or K), methionine (Met or M), proline (Pro or P), phenylalanine (Phe or F), serine (Ser or S), tryptophan (Trp or W), threonine (Thr or T), tyrosine (Tyr or Y), and valine (Val or V). In a preferred embodiment, the peptide comprises only naturally occurring amino acids and/or only L-amino acids. Each amino acid can be an unnatural, non-standard, or synthetic amino acids, such as aminohexanoic acid, biphenylalanine, cyclohexylalanine, cyclohexylglycine, diethylglycine, dipropylglycine, 2,3-diaminoproprionic acid, homophenylalanine, homoserine, homotyrosine, naphthylalanine, norleucine, ornithine, phenylalanine (4-fluoro), phenylalanine(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluoro), phenylalanine(4-nitro), phenylglycine, pipecolic acid, sarcosine, tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid, and tert-leucine. Preferably, synthetic amino acids with alkyl side chains are selected from C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>17 </sub>alkyls, preferably C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6 </sub>alkyls. In one embodiment, the peptide comprises one or more amino acid alcohols, e.g., serine and threonine. In another embodiment, the peptide comprises one or more N"
