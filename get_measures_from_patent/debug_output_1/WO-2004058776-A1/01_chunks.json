    "he beads were suspended in 25 \u03bcl of 94\u00b0C hot 2x Laemmli loading buffer plus beta- mercaptoethanol and left to stand for 15 min at room temperature.</p>\n  The beads were removed by exposing the tubes for 1 min in the magnet, and the total liquid separated from the beads from each immuno-precipitate loaded onto Polyacrylamide/SDS protein gels (pre-cast 4-12 % BisTris NuPAGE / MOPS 12 well gels from Novex). Protein gels were run at 200 V and then blotted onto NC membrane for 1 h 30 min at 50 V / 250 mA. All blots were treated with 5% Marvel in PBS-Tween forl hour at room temperature to reduce non-specific binding of the detection antibody. A rabbit anti-Tie2 (Santa Cruz sc-324) was added in a 1:500 dilution in 0.5 % Marvel / PBS-Tween and left to incubate overnight at 4\u00b0C. The blots were rigorously washed with PBS-Tween before adding the goat anti rabbit -POD conjugate (Dako P0448) at a 1:5000 dilution in 0.5 % Marvel / PBS-Tween. The antibody was left on for 1 hour at room temperature before subsequently washing the blots with PBS-Tween. The western blots of the various immuno-precipitated samples were developed the blots with LumiGLO (NEB 7003). And transferred to an X-Ray cassette and films exposed for 15 sec / 30 sec and 60 sec. The relative strength of the protein band which pertains to the phosphorylated Tie2 receptor was evaluated using a FluorS BioRad image analyser system. The percentage phosphorylation for each test compound \n\ndilution series was determined from which IC50 values were calculated by standard methods using the appropriate control samples as reference.</p>\n  Although the pharmacological properties of the compounds of the Formula I vary with structural change as expected, in general activity possessed by compounds of the Formula I, may be demonstrated at the following concentrations or doses in one or more of the above tests (a) and (b):-</p>\n  Test (a):- IC<sub>5</sub>o in the range, for example, &lt; 500\u03bcM;</p>\n  Test (b):- IC<sub>5</sub>0 in the range, for example, &lt; 50\u03bcM;</p>\n  According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a compound of the Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, as defined hereinbefore in association with a pharmaceutically-acceptable diluent or carrier.</p>\n  The compositions of the invention may be in a form suitable for oral use (for example as tablets, lozenges, hard or soft capsules, aqueous or oily suspensions, emulsions, dispersible powders or granules, syrups or elixirs), for topical use (for example as creams, ointments, gels, or aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions), for administration by inhalation (for . example as a finely divided powder or a liquid aerosol), for administration by insufflation (for example as a finely divided powder) or for parenteral administration (for example as a sterile aqueous or oily solution for intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular or intramuscular dosing or as a suppository f"
