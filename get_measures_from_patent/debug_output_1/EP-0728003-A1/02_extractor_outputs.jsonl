{"raw_mentions": "The IC50 of Lisofylline for inhibiting phosphodiesterase is between 100 and 500 \u03bcM in in vitro systems which is significantly higher than the concentrations (10-30 \u03bcM) at which Lisofylline effectively inhibits PA synthesis (Rice et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:3857, 1994)."}
