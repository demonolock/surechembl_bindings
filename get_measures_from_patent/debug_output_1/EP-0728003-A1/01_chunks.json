    "ls) treatment following blood loss decreased lung injury and lung neutrophil accumulation in mice subjected to hemorrhage-resuscitation, a finding paralleled by Lisofylline treatment decreasing neutrophil function in vitro. Systemic hypoxia followed by tissue reoxygenation, such as occurs in hemorrhage-resuscitation, induces the formation of linoleoyl PA in neutrophils as well as lung tissue. Increased</p>\n  3 / \n\nproduction of PA then induces neutrophil chemotaxis, proinflammatory cytokine generation and lung injury.</p>\n  Lisofylline also abrogated induction of mRNA for several proinflammatory cytokines in multiple cell types in the lungs of mice subjected to hemorrhage-resuscitation. These effects are explained by the basic signaling nature of linoleoyl PA on diverse components of the inflammatory cascade. Inflammatory stimuli translocate LPAAT to the plasma membrane (Bursten et al., J. Biol. Chem. 266:20732, 1991), therefore translocation and activation of LPAAT occur after oxidative stress. Adding PA to cells also produces potent mitogenic effects, stimulates calcium flux and phospholipase C activity, and induces expression of several protooncogenes and growth factors (Moolenaar et al., Nature 323: 171, 1986; Altin et al., Biochem J. 247:613, 1987; and Knauss et al., J. Biol. Chem. 265:14457, 1990). Inhibition of LPAAT by Lisofylline appears to be the primary intracellular signaling pathway responsible for the observed effects on neutrophil function and lung injury. The IC50 of Lisofylline for inhibiting phosphodiesterase is between 100 and 500 \u03bcM in in vitro systems which is significantly higher than the concentrations (10-30 \u03bcM) at which Lisofylline effectively inhibits PA synthesis (Rice et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:3857, 1994).</p>\n  3^1 \n</p>\n"
