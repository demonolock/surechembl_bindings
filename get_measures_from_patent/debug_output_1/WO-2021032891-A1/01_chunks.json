    "lopment of ARG inhibitors is relevant across many disease indications. There is accumulated data on the role of ARG in tumour-associated MDSC and its pathogenetic role in inflammation-induced immunosuppression as described above. ARG2 specifically has been implicated in several cancers including osteosarcoma (Setty et al., 2016), HCMV-driven GBM (Costa etai, 2016), pancreatic cancer (Ino etai, 2013), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (Bron et al., 2013), thyroid (Sousa et al., 2010), prostate (Mumenthaler et al., 2008), neuroblastoma (Mussai et al., 2015) and breast cancer (Polat et al., 2002). </p>Several specific ARG small molecule inhibitors have already been developed and tested in vitro. The intermediate of NO-synthesis, NG-hydroxy-L-arginine (NOHA) is a well-known arginase inhibitor (Hecker et al., 1995). It was successfully employed in human prostate carcinoma organ cultures, inhibited ARG activity and restored reactivity of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes in cooperation with a NOS inhibitor (Bronte etai., 2005). The L-arginine derivative Nw-hydroxynor-L-arginine (nor-NOHA) was, for example, able to completely reverse PMN- mediated T cell suppression in purulent inflammation (Munder et al., 2006) and to restore airway responsiveness in an arginase-mediated asthma animal model (Maarsingh et al., \n\n2006). The boronic acids 2(S)-amino-6-boronohexanoic acid (ABH) and S-(2-boronoethyl)-L- cysteine (BEC) are potent inhibitors of both ARG isoforms at physiologic pH (with binding constant (KD) of approximately 0.3 mM), binding with much higher affinity than the natural substrate (L-arginine K<sub>m</sub> is 5 mM) (Ash et al., 2004; Christianson et al., 2005). Human ARG1 was crystallized in association with both inhibitors and new insights into the catalytic mechanism have been gained (Di Costanzo et al., 2005). </p>However, limitations remain in arginase-based therapies, due to concerns that existing small molecule inhibitors of ARG (NOHA and L-NMMA) may inhibit both ARG1 and ARG2 and consequently may inhibit the urea cycle in healthy cells, leading to hyperammonemia. </p>WO2018236828 discloses that ARG2 expression and activity is a strong effector of Treg immunosuppressive activity; impaired ARG2 is associated with aberrant autoimmune processes, while strong ARG2 activity is associated with detrimental suppression of immune response to tumours. It is proposed that modulation of Treg suppressive activity may be used to treat disease states mediated by Treg dysfunction and by Treg suppressive activity. WO2018236828 discusses inhibiting suppressive Treg activity by inhibition or ablation of ARG2. The use of an ARG2 inhibitor for the treatment of cancer is disclosed; potential ARG2 inhibitors are listed as CB 1158, 2(S)-amino-6-boronohexanoic Acid (ABH), (2S)-5, 29,59- trihydroxy-7,8-dimethoxy flavanone, R)-2-amino-6-borono-2-(2-(piperidin-1-yl)ethyl)hexanoic acid], and piceatannol-3'-0^-d-glucopyranoside, an antibody, a composition of matter which facilitates the",
    " as an antibody, e.g., a monoclonal antibody, to target ARG2 has several advantages over a small molecule approach, because it may enable both inhibition and depletion of ARG2 (via Fc mediated clearance of the antibody - antigen (Ab-Ag) complex). An antibody that specifically targets extracellular ARG2 may alleviate concerns about toxicity and reduce the risk of unwanted adverse effects in patients resulting from inhibition of intracellular arginase. An antibody may also distinguish between the two arginase isomers enabling selectivity for ARG2 over ARG1 and thus specific inhibition of ARG2 in a way that a small molecule would not be able to achieve due to the high degree of similarity between the active sites of ARG1 and ARG2. Finally, an antibody therapeutic may have better pharmacological properties than small molecule inhibitors including increased bioavailability and sustained action in the bloodstream of patients, e.g., AML patients. </p>The invention provides: </p>1.

    "aughan et ai, 1996). Anti-ARG2 scFv antibodies were isolated from the phage display libraries using a series of selection cycles on recombinant human biotinylated ARG2 (avi- \n\nArg2-His10, made in house) essentially as previously described (Hawkins et ai, 1992; Vaughan et a!., 1996). In brief, for the first round of solution-phase selections, biotinylated human ARG2 in Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS, pH 7) was added (final concentration of 100 nM biotinylated human ARG2) to purified phage particles that had been pre-incubated for 1 hour in Marvel-PBS (3% w/v) containing Streptavidin-coupled paramagnetic beads (Dynabeads\u00ae M280, Invitrogen Life Sciences, UK). Streptavidin beads were removed prior to addition of antigen. Phage particles that bound to the biotinylated human ARG2 were captured using new Streptavidin-coupled paramagnetic beads, and weakly-bound phage were removed by a series of wash cycles using PBS-Tween (0.1% v/v). Bound phage particles were eluted from the beads using Trypsin (10 ng/ml final concentration diluted in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer; pH 7), infected into E. coli TG1 bacteria and rescued for the next round of selection (Vaughan etal., 1996). Two subsequent rounds of selection were carried out as previously described but with a reduced concentration of biotinylated ARG2 antigen, specifically 50 nM and 25 nM of biotinylated human ARG2 at round 2 and round 3, respectively. </p>1.4 Identification of ARG2 specific scFv fragments using a direct-binding assay (unpurified scFv) </p>Unpurified scFv from periplasmic preparations were screened in a homogeneous time- resolved fluorescence (HTRF\u2122, CisBio Bioassays, France) binding assay using a Pherastar plate reader (BMG Labtech, Germany). In this assay, binding of unpurified scFv to recombinant human trimeric ARG2 enzyme was assessed by measuring the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the c-myc tagged scFv and the biotinylated enzyme using streptavidin cryptate and anti-c-myc-XL665 detection reagents (CisBio International, France; cat: 610SAKLB and 61MYCXLB respectively). Selection outputs were screened as unpurified bacterial periplasmic extracts containing scFv, prepared in 200 mM tris buffer pH 7.4, 0.5 mM EDTA and 0.5 M sucrose. 5 pi of unpurified scFv samples were added to a Greiner\u00ae 384 well assay plate (Greiner Bio-one, UK; cat: 784076). This was followed by the addition of 5 mI of 12 nM recombinant human trimeric ARG2 enzyme, 5 mI of 6.67 nM streptavidin cryptate and 5 mI 40 nM anti-c-myc-XL665. Non-specific binding wells (negative controls) were defined for each plate by using a negative control unpurified scFv in place of the test scFv sample. Cross-reactive scFv clones were identified using a concurrent assay with recombinant human trimeric ARG1 enzyme. All dilutions were performed in phosphate buffered saline (ThermoFisher Scientific, UK; cat: 14190-094) containing 0.4 M KF (VWR, UK; cat: 26820.236) and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma, UK; cat: A9576) (assay buffer). Assay plates were incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C prior to \n\nreading time resolved fluorescence on a Pherastar plate reader (PerkinElmer, USA) using a",
    "ay plate (Greiner Bio-one, UK; cat: 781901). This was followed by the addition of 5 mI of 1.6 mg/ml trimeric human ARG2 that had been diluted in 40 mM MnCh, 100 mM tris-HCI, pH7.4 (4x enzyme buffer). Following an overnight pre-incubation of ARG2 and unpurified scFv at 4 \u00b0C, the assay plate was brought to room temperature and the enzymatic reaction was started with the addition of 5 m1 100 mM L-arginine substrate and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. </p>Urea was detected by the simultaneous addition of equal volumes of O-Phthaldialdehyde (1.5 mM O-Phthaldialdehyde, 7% H<sub>2</sub>S0<sub>4</sub>, 0.03% Brij L23) and N-(1- Napthyl)ethylenediamine (1.66 mM N-(1-Napthyl)ethylenediamine, 81 mM Boric acid, 21% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 0.03% Brij L23) followed by an 18 minute incubation at room temperature before the colorimetric product was quantified on the Pherastar by measuring absorbance at 505 nm. \n\nBackground control wells were defined for each plate by the omission of substrate. Maximum signal control wells were defined for each plate by using CEA6, an irrelevant unpurified scFv in place of the test scFv sample. </p>Data were analysed by calculating % maximum (max) control for each sample using the 505 nm absorbance data. % max control was determined according to equation 2. </p>Equation 2: </p>% max control = 100*((Test sample - mean maximum control) / (mean background control - mean maximum control)) </p>1.6 Identification of ARG2 specific scFv using a direct binding assay (purified scFv)</p>Unpurified scFv periplasm extracts that showed specific binding to biotinylated recombinant human trimeric ARG2 enzyme by HTRF\u2122 assay were subjected to DNA sequencing (Osbourn et ai, 1996; Vaughan et al., 1996). The scFv with unique protein sequences were expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography (essentially as described (Bannister et al., 2006)). The ARG2 binding profile of each purified scFv was determined by testing a dilution series of the purified scFv in the HTRF\u2122 assay described in section 1.4, substituting the unpurified scFv periplasmic preparation with the purified scFv. The purified scFv were tested concurrently for binding to biotinylated recombinant human trimeric ARG2 enzyme, biotinylated recombinant human trimeric ARG1 enzyme and recombinant cynomolgus monkey trimeric ARG2 enzyme. Data were analysed by calculating the % Delta F values as described in section 1.4. Example results for purified C0020187 scFv and purified C0020065 scFv are shown in Figure 1. These results demonstrate that C0020187 scFv and C0020065 scFv specifically bind to biotinylated recombinant human trimeric ARG2 enzyme and biotinylated recombinant cynomolgus monkey trimeric ARG2 enzyme and not to human recombinant human trimeric ARG1 enzyme. </p>1.7 Screening for purified scFv fragments which inhibit ARG2 in an enzyme inhibition assay</p>Purified anti-ARG2 scFv fragments were screened for their ability to inhibit enzymatic activity of trimeric ARG2 (Figure 2) using the assay described in section 1.5. </p>IC50 values were determined by testing a dilution series of the purified scFv, prepared in TBS, in the ARG2 enzyme inhibition assay described in section 1.5, substituting the unpurified scFv periplasmic preparation with the purified scFv. \n\nBackground control wells were defined for each plate by the omission of substrate. Maximum signal control wells were defined for each plate in wells, which contained substrate in the absence of inhibitor. Data were analysed by calculating % maximum (max) control for each sample. % max control was determined according to equation 1 detailed in section 1.5. </p>Purified scFv were tested alongside N-Hydroxyl-L-Arginine (a small molecule competitive inhibitor of ARG2) as a positive control and CEA6 (irrelevant isotype control antibody) as a negative control. Data points were plotted and ICsoS determined using a four-parameter fit in GraphPad Prism. </p>1.8 Reformatting of ARG2 specific, inhibitory antibodies from scFv to lgGi </p>Specific clones were converted from scFv to IgGi by sub-cloning the variable heavy chain (VH) and variable light chain (VL) domains into vectors expressing whole human antibody heavy and light chains respectively. The variable heavy chains were cloned into a mammalian expression vector (pEU 1.3) containing the human heavy chain constant domains and regulatory elements to express whole IgGi heavy chain in mammalian cells. Similarly, the variable light chain domain was cloned into a mammalian expression vector for the expression of the human lambda light chain constant domains (pEU4.4) or human lambda kappa light chain constant domains (pEU3.4) and regulatory elements to express whole IgG light chain in mammalian cells. Vectors for the expression of heavy chains and light chains were originally described in Persic et ai, 1997. To obtain clones as IgGi, the heavy and light chain IgG expression vectors were transiently transfected into ExpiCHO (ThermoScientific UK; cat. number: A29133) cells where the antibody was expressed and secreted into the medium. Harvested media was filtered prior to purification. The IgGs were purified using Protein A chromatography (MabSelect SuRe, GE Healthcare, UK). Culture supernatants were loaded onto an appropriate Protein A column pre-equilibrated in 25 mM tris pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCI. Bound IgG was eluted from the column using 0.1 M Sodium Citrate pH 3.0, 100 mM NaCI. The IgGs were buffer exchanged into TBS 25 mM tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCI). The purified IgGs were passed through a 0.2 pm filter and the concentration of IgG was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient based on the amino acid sequence of the IgG. The purified IgGs were analysed for aggregation or degradation using SEC-HPLC and SDS-PAGE techniques. </p>1.9 Confirming binding profile of ARG2 specific recombinant IgGi to ARG2 in a direct binding assay \n\nThe purified scFv fragments that bound specifically to biotinylated recombinant human trimeric ARG2 enzyme were converted to recombinant IgG. Binding of recombinant IgG to human trimeric ARG2 enzyme was confirmed by testing a dilution series of the recombinant IgG in the HTRF\u2122 assay described in section 1.4, substituting the unpurified scFv with the recombinant IgG. A further modification to the assay was the substitution of anti-c-myc- XL665 detection reagent with anti-human Fc XL665 detection reagent (CisBio International, France; cat: 61 HFCXLB) as the recombinant IgG had no c-myc tag. Data were analysed by calculating the % Delta F values as described in section 1.4. </p>1. 10 Confirming the trimeric ARG2 inhibition profile of ARG2 specific recombinant lgGi in an enzyme inhibition assay </p>The purified scFv fragments that inhibited the enzymatic activity of human trimeric ARG2 enzyme were converted to recombinant IgG. ARG2 specific recombinant IgGi were screened for their ability to inhibit enzymatic activity of trimeric ARG2 (Figure 3) using the assay described in section 1.5. </p>IC50 values were determined by testing a dilution series of the ARG2 specific recombinant IgGi, prepared in TBS, in the ARG2 enzyme inhibition assay described in section 1.5, substituting the unpurified scFv periplasmic preparation with the ARG2 specific recombinant IgGi. </p>ARG2 specific recombinant IgGi were tested alongside N-Hydroxyl-L-Arginine (a small molecule competitive inhibitor of ARG2) as a positive control and NIP228 (irrelevant isotype control antibody) as a negative control. Data points were plotted and IC50 values determined using a four parameter fit in GraphPad Prism. </p>1.11 Restoration of T cell proliferation by ARG2 IgGs </p>Anti-ARG2 antibodies were screened for their ability to restore T cell proliferation by inhibiting enzymatic activity of ARG2 and hence, prevent the depletion of the L-arginine, which is required for T cell proliferation. This assay served to provide in vitro evidence of functional efficacy for each antibody. </p>Briefly, Leukocyte cones (NHS Blood and Transplant, Watford, UK) underwent Ficoll Plaque (GE, Sweden; Cat: 17-1440-02) gradient separation, PBMC\u2019s were extracted and pan T cell population isolated by negative selection using the Human T Cell Enrichment Kit (Stemcell Technologies, France; Cat: 19051) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. \n\n40000 cells/well were seeded in complete growth media (RMPI 1640, 5% Human Serum Albumin) into a 96 well clear TC treated microplate (Greiner-Bio One, Germany; Cat: 655180).

In this assay, the ability of ARG2 specific recombinant IgGi to inhibit the enzymatic activity of monomeric ARG2 was determined by measuring the production of urea, the product of L-arginine turnover by monomeric ARG2. </p>IC50 values were determined by testing a dilution series of the ARG2 specific recombinant IgGi, prepared in TBS. </p>10 pi of ARG2 specific recombinant IgGi (dilution series) were added to a Greiner bio-one\u00ae 384 well assay plate (Greiner Bio-one, UK; cat: 781901). This was followed by the addition of 5 mI of 1.6 mg/ml monomeric ARG2 that had been diluted in 40 mM MnCL, 100 mM tris- HCI, pH7.4 (4x enzyme buffer). </p>Following an overnight pre-incubation of monomeric ARG2 and ARG2 specific IgGi at 4 \u00b0C, the assay plate was brought to room temperature and the enzymatic reaction was started with the addition of 5 mI 100 mM L-arginine substrate and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. </p>Urea was detected by the simultaneous addition of equal volumes of O-Phthaldialdehyde (1.5 mM O-Phthaldialdehyde, 7% H<sub>2</sub>S0<sub>4</sub>, 0.03% Brij L23) and N-(1-</p>Napthyl)ethylenediamine (1.66 mM N-(1-Napthyl)ethylenediamine, 81 mM Boric acid, 21% \n\nH<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 0.03% Brij L23) followed by an 18 minute incubation at room temperature before the colorimetric product was quantified on the Pherastar by measuring absorbance at 505 nm.</p>ARG2 specific recombinant IgGi were tested alongside N-Hydroxyl-L-Arginine (a small molecule competitive inhibitor of ARG2) as a positive control and NIP228 (irrelevant isotype control antibody) as a negative control.

    " biosensor tip result in a shift in interference pattern, which can be measured in real time. Molecules associating with or dissociating from ligands at the biosensor tip shift the interference pattern and generate a response on the Octet system which is recorded by the acquisition software. </p>Typically, a defined concentration of the analyte species is brought into contact with the coupled ligand and any binding is detected as an increased in signal (association phase). This is followed by a period of buffer rinse, during which dissociation of the analyte species from the surface immobilised ligand can be observed as a decrease in signal (dissociation \n\nphase). Repetition of this with a range of analyte concentrations provides data for the analysis of binding kinetics. </p>An Octet Kinetics Buffer (PBS containing 0.01% BSA and 0.002% Tween20) is typically used as the diluent buffer for the analyte samples and as the flow buffer during the dissociation phase. The experimental data is recorded over time as shift in interference pattern (nm) over time, which is directly proportional to the optical thickness at the biosensor tip, which in turn is an approximate measure of the mass of analyte bound. The proprietary Octet Data Analysis software package can then be used to process data and fit binding models to the data sets. Returned association (k<sub>a</sub>, M <sup>1</sup> s <sup>1</sup>) and dissociation ( \u00be, s <sup>1</sup>) rate constants allow calculation of dissociation (KD, M) affinity constants. </p>The affinity of binding between the Fab of C0020187 and human ARG2, cynomolgus ARG2 and human ARG1 was estimated using assays in which the biotinylated ARG antigen was captured on a streptavidin sensor tip. A fresh sensor tip was used for each measurement and no regeneration was used. A series of dilutions of the C0020187 Fab (3.25 - 240 nM) were individually placed in contact with the ligand surface for a sufficient amount of time to observe sensorgrams that could be fitted to an appropriate binding model with confidence (typically 5 minutes), followed by an appropriate length of dissociation time (typically 10 minutes). Blank reference (0 nM Fab) data were subtracted from each dataset to reduce the impact of any buffer artefacts or non-specific binding effects. An appropriate binding model was then fitted simultaneously to the data from each analyte titration using the Octet Evaluation software. </p>Example results for C0020187 are shown in Table 9, showing the association rate constants (ka), dissociation rate constants (k<sub>d</sub>) and dissociation constants (KD). These parameters were derived from a 1 : 1 binding fit to the data. \n<img id=\"imgf000076_0001\" path=\"imgf000076_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/811449473/WO/20210225/A1/002021/03/28/91/imgf000076_0001.tif\"/>\n \n\n\n<img id=\"imgf000077_0002\" path=\"imgf000077_0002.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/811449440/WO/20210225/A1/002021/03/28/91/imgf000077_0002.tif\"/>\n </p>Table 9. Affinity Data for C0020187 and ARG2 interaction </p>1.16 Understanding the Mechanism of action of ARG2 specific IgGs on the enzyme ARG2</p>The mechanism of action of the lead identification clone C0020187 IgG was investigated using the human ARG2 (trimer) enzyme inhibition assay. </p>The enzyme inhibition assay is described in sections 1.5 and is a biochemical assay that measures production of urea, the product of L-arginine turnover by ARG2. To investigate the mechanism of action of C0020187 IgG, four point titrations of C0020187 IgG (10, 3, 1 and 0.3 mM) were set up in the presence of 11 concentrations of arginine (500, 400, 300, 200, 125, 75, 50, 25, 17, 10 and 5 mM) and the reaction allowed to proceed for 80, 60, 45,</p>30, 15 or 5 minutes before the addition of the urea detection reagents O-Phthaldialdehyde and N-(1-Napthyl)ethylenediamine. </p>Raw data from each separate concentration of C0020187 was plotted as a function of time for each concentration of arginine and fitted using a linear fit (GraphPad Prism) to derive initial velocities (slope valu",
