Kinome profiling at 1 µM compound concentration revealed that compound 1 has excellent selectivity across the human kinome, with a selectivity score, S10 of 0.013. Importantly other targets in the PI3K pathway such as Akt, DNA-PK, BTK and mTOR are not inhibited (FIGs. 1 and 2) and BRD4 activity is low (BRD4_1 IC50 = 6.0 µM, FIG. 3).\nThe compound has some inhibitory effects on PIP5K2C (PIP4K-γ), a lipid kinase with low levels of activity in vitro. In our experience this level of inhibition in KINOMEscan corresponds to micromolar biochemical IC50.\nAs some activity is present for PI3K-α (and H1047L/Y mutants) we measured PI3K-α and PI3K-β IC50s to determine the isoform selectivity. Compound 1 is 26 fold selective for PI3K-δ over PI3K-α and 272 fold selective over PI3K-β.\n1Me  53  54  42  35  9  120  2 \n2Me  --  23  11  12  23  16  3 \n3Me  --  20  12  23  55  63  14 \n4Me  --  20  12  23  55  63  14 \n\nNote that I extracted the table rows as they contain the required information.
