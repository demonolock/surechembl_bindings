    "logy (Hanover, MA), and anti-\u03b1-tubulin antibody was from Sigma (Rockford, IL).</p>Assay Data and AnalysisThroughout the course of a screening program campaign designed to identify anti-leukemic compounds, we observed that Compound 1 shows antiproliferative activity in T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL) cell lines (IC<sub>50</sub> MOLT4 cells = 33 nM, IC<sub>50</sub> Jurkat cells = 166 nM). Subsequent kinome profiling revealed the primary targets of this compound are PI3K-\u03b4/\u03b3 (Table 1, FIG. 1, FIG. 2), leading us to explore the SAR of this series. Analogs from our initial screen lacking an arylsulfonamide showed no effects on PI3K-\u03b4/\u03b3 using KINOMEscan profiling from DiscoverX<sup>\u00ae</sup> (e.g. compound 19), therefore we focused our synthetic efforts on compounds containing this moiety (Reference 9).</p>We have previously reported that the 5,11-dihydro-6H-benzo[e]pyrimido[5,4-b][1,4]diazepin-6-one scaffold is capable of binding to the ATP binding pocket of LRRK210, ERK511, AuroraA/B kinases12 and to the acetyl-lysine binding pocket of the BRD4 bromodomains (Reference 13) However, methylation of the phenyl ring in the tricyclic core is not tolerated by most kinases. Kinome profiling at 1 \u00b5M compound concentration revealed that compound 1 has excellent selectivity across the human kinome, with a selectivity score, S10 of 0.013. Importantly other targets in the PI3K pathway such as Akt, DNA-PK, BTK and mTOR are not inhibited (FIGs. 1 and 2) and BRD4 activity is low (BRD4_1 IC50 = 6.0 \u00b5M, FIG. 3).</p>The compound has some inhibitory effects on PIP5K2C (PIP4K-\u03b3), a lipid kinase with low levels of activity in vitro. In our experience this level of inhibition in KINOMEscan corresponds to micromolar biochemical IC<sub>50</sub>. As some activity is present for PI3K-\u03b1 (and H1047L/Y mutants) we measured PI3K-\u03b1 and PI3K-\u03b2 IC<sub>50</sub>s to determine the isoform selectivity. Compound 1 is 26 fold selective for PI3K-\u03b4 over PI3K-\u03b1 and 272 fold selective over PI3K-\u03b2. The only off-target activity of concern is against Aurora kinases A and B. Subsequent enzymatic testing revealed that Compound 1 has 30 fold selectivity over Aurora A and 60 fold over Aurora B.\nTable 1.<img id=\"ib0123\" path=\"imgb0123.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/1011254788/EP/20221221/B1/000003/44/00/84/imgb0123.tif\"/>No.StructureIC<sub>50</sub>(nm)R'R\"PI3K-\u03b1 (a)PI3K-\u03b2 (a)PI3K-\u03b3 (a)PI3K-\u03b4 (a)Aurora A (b)Aurora B (b)1Me<img id=\"ib0124\" path=\"imgb0124.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/1011254789/EP/20221221/B1/000003/44/00/84/imgb0124.tif\"/>5354423591202 \u2020Me<img id=\"ib0125\" path=\"imgb0125.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/1011254790/EP/20221221/B1/000003/44/00/84/imgb0125.tif\"/>--23111223163Me<img id=\"ib0126\" path=\"imgb0126.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/1011254791/EP/20221221/B1/000003/44/00/84/imgb0126.tif\"/>--201223556314 \u2020Me<img id=\"ib0127\" path=\"imgb0127.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/ass"
