    "ge of any deviation of aspect.</p>As used herein, \" immune response \" refer to, for amino acid residue sequence (\" binding site \" or \" epi-position \"), there is specific antibody or its Fab.Term \" combination \" refer in physiological conditions owing to such as covalency, electrostatic, hydrophobicity and ion and/or interaction of hydrogen bond two molecules between direct association, and comprise and interacting as salt bridged bond and water bridged bond and other conventional engagement means any.Term \" preferred combination \" means that bonding agent and it are bonded to compared with incoherent aminoacid sequence, is bonded to binding site with larger avidity.Preferably with bonding agent for incoherent aminoacid sequence avidity compared with, large at least 1 times of this kind of avidity, large at least 2 times, large at least 3 times, large at least 4 times, large at least 5 times, large at least 6 times, large at least 7 times, large at least 8 times, large at least 9 times, large 10 times, large at least 20 times, large at least 30 times, large at least 40 times, large at least 50 times, large at least 60 times, large at least 70 times, large at least 80 times, large at least 90 times, large at least 100 times or large at least 1000 times.Term \" immune response \" and \" preferred combination \" are used interchangeably in this article.</p>As used herein, term \" avidity \" refers to the equilibrium constant of the Reversible binding of two reagent and represents with Kd.In one embodiment, antibody or its Fab represent desired characteristic as such as passed through K\n        <sub>d</sub>measured by (equilibrium dissociation constant) for target antigen 1 \u00d7 10\n        <sup>-6</sup>in M or following scope, or little of 10\n        <sup>-16</sup>m or following scope interior (such as, about 10\n        <sup>-7</sup>, 10\n        <sup>-8</sup>, 10\n        <sup>-9</sup>, 10\n        <sup>-10</sup>, 10\n        <sup>-11</sup>, 10\n        <sup>-12</sup>, 10\n        <sup>-13</sup>, 10\n        <sup>-14</sup>, 10\n        <sup>-15</sup>, 10\n        <sup>-16</sup>m or less) binding affinity.Equilibrium dissociation constant can use BIAcore and/or KinExA to determine in solution equilibria measures.As used herein, term \" avidity \" refers to after the dilution, and the mixture of two or more reagent is for the resistance of dissociating.Other technology any that apparent avidity is familiar with as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or those skilled in the art by method is determined.Other technology any that avidity is familiar with as Scatchard analysis or those skilled in the art by method is determined.\n      </p>When needing the increase avidity of antibody, the residue in the CDR of converted antibodies can use usual currently known methods to replace with other amino acid in addition.Typically, four amino-acid residues that are no more than in CDR change, and two residues that are no more than in the most usual CDR change, and except heavy chain CDR2, wherein nearly ten (10) residues can change.The change of avidity is measured by routine method as described herein (such as, Biacore).The activity of modified antibodies can use conventional determining to determine based on particular target antigen.</p>\" epi-position \" refers to antigen or can form other macromolecular part of binding interactions with the variable region of antibody in conjunction with capsule.This kind of binding interactions can show as the intermolecular contacts with one or more amino-acid residues of one or more CDR.Antigen combine can relate to such as CDR3 or CDR3 to or the interaction o"
