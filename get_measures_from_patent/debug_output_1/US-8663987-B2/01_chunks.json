    "mplary method for analyzing secretion of BDNF (and other neurotrophic factors (NTFs) is described herein below.</p>ELISA for Secreted NTFs</p>For analysis of secreted NTFs, supernatant is collected from cultures of MSCs or of NTF-secreting cells at the end of the differentiation procedure described above, and cells are harvested and counted. The amount of NTFs such as Glial Derived Neurothrophic Factor, (GDNF) or Brain Derived Neurothrophic Factor (BDNF) in the cell's culture supernatants was quantified by using a GDNF or BDNF ELISA assay (GDNF DuoSet DY212; BDNF DuoSet DY248; R&amp;D Systems) according to the manufacture's protocol.</p>As mentioned according to the phenotype, the cells and cell populations of the present invention may be used to treat a particular disease or disorder. The cell populations may be used directly following differentiation or may be enriched for a particular phenotype as described hereinabove. As summarized in Table 3 hereinbelow, certain neurotrophic factors or set of neurotrophic factors have been shown to be particularly beneficial for treating a particular disease. For example, cells of the present invention which secrete BDNF and GDNF would be particularly suitable for treating Parkinson's.</p>TABLE 3AstrocyticDiseasephenotypeREFParkinsonsBDNF, FGF,Walker DG, et al.

    "igma-Aldrich) after each transplantation session.</p>Study Design</p>The in-vivo experiment was performed on the 6-OHDA induced striatal lesion model. Cells, or PBS as control, were transplanted on the same day of the 6-OHDA injections, 50 minutes later, posterior to the lesion within the treated striatum. The experiment consisted of the following groups: the control group was treated with 6-OHDA and with PBS instead of cellular treatment (n=10); MSC treated groups were treated with either a high dose (450,000 cells, n=10) or a low dose (150,000 cells, n=11) of serum free medium treated MSC; NTF-SC group was treated with either high dose (450,000 cells, n=10) or low dose (150,000 cells, n=11) of induced NTF-SC. Another group of untreated animals (n=7) were used as controls for the open field test.</p>For cell tracking purposes three different time points were analyzed by using histology based study or in-vivo MRI. At the first time point, 7 days post cellular treatment, 4 animals that were treated with high dose NTF-SC were sacrificed for histological evaluation only. For the second time point, on the 35<sup>th </sup>day, we conducted an in-vivo MRI study on selected animals. These animals (n=3 from the control group and n=3 from the low dose NTF-SC treated group) were treated with cells that were pre-labeled with super-paramagnetic iron oxide particles (SPIOs, Feridex, Advanced magnetic, Cambridge, Mass., USA). SPIOs were incubated with poly-L-lysine (1 \u03bcg/ml medium, 70-150 KD, Sigma-Aldrich) for one hour before adding to the medium on the last day of stage 1 medium treatment. Cultures were washed with stage 2 medium of induction after 24 hours. The control group was treated with 1 \u03bcg of SPIOs in 6 \u03bcl of PBS (the same volume of the cell suspension). The last time point for cell tracking was at the end of the experiment, at 50 days after treatment day.</p>Immunosuppression was induced by daily subcutaneous administration of 15 mg/Kg cyclosporine A (Novartis, Basel, Switzerland), starting one day prior to cellular treatment and continued throughout the experiment. Animals received prophylactic antibiotic treatment with Enrofloxacin (50 mg/Kg, Bayer, Germany) for five days from the first day of the experiment.</p>Behavioral Tests</p>D-Amphetamine-induced rotational behavior was measured for 90 minutes following i.p. administration of 2.5 mg/Kg (Sigma-Aldrich) using an automated Rotameter device (San Diego Instruments, San-Diego, Calif., USA). The net ipsilateral rotations were measured at 14, 28 and 42 days post cell transplantation.</p>Open field test was conducted at 7 days post treatment by introducing the animals into a 50 cm<sup>2 </sup>arena and videotaping the spontaneous behavior of the rats for 30 minutes. The images were analyzed by EthoVision 3 software (Noldus, The Netherlands).</p>MRI</p>Anesthesia was induced with 4% isoflurane in 95% O<sub>2</sub>, and maintained with \u02dc1-2% isoflurane (Vetmarket ltd., Petah-Tikva, Israel) at a flow r"
