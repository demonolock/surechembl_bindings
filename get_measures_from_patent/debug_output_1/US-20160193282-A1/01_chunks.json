    "d about 2000 IU/mL, between about 150 IU/mL and about 1500 IU/mL, between about 150 IU/mL and about 500 IU/mL, between about 150 IU/mL and about 250 IU/mL, between about 250 IU/mL and about 8000 IU/mL, between about 250 IU/mL and about 5000 IU/mL, between about 250 IU/mL and about 2500 IU/mL, between about 250 IU/mL and about 500 IU/mL, between about 500 IU/mL and about 8000 IU/mL, between about 500 IU/mL and about 5000 IU/mL, or between about 500 IU/mL and about 2500 IU/mL of the oxytocin peptide. In a preferred embodiment, the magnesium-containing oxytocin peptide formulation or composition comprises between about 50 IU/mL and about 1000 IU/mL, between about 75 IU/mL and about 750 IU/mL, or between about 100 IU/mL and about 600 IU/mL of the oxytocin peptide. In one embodiment, the oxytocin peptide is human oxytocin consisting of Cys-Tyr-Ile-Gln-Asn-Cys-Pro-Leu-Gly (SEQ. ID NO:1).</p>Any magnesium salt (such as a water-soluble magnesium salt) may be used to provide magnesium in the magnesium-containing oxytocin peptide formulation of this invention provided that when used in treating pain, a synergistic analgesia is produced. The magnesium salt used in the magnesium-containing oxytocin peptide formulation may be selected based on a number of factors such as the amount of free magnesium ion that can be delivered when the formulation is administered, the solubility of the magnesium salt in the media for a liquid formulation, the acidity/basicity of the counter ion, and/or the dissociation constant of the salt. For example, in a liquid formulation, the magnesium salt needs to be sufficiently soluble in the liquid media to deliver the magnesium ion concentration required for producing synergistic analgesia with the oxytocin peptide. Other factors may also be considered when selecting the magnesium salt, such as compatibility with other substances in the formulation and ability of the counter ion to perform other functions in the formulation. For example, magnesium citrate is sufficiently soluble in an aqueous solution to provide the desirable amount of magnesium or desirable magnesium ion concentration; citrate salts are pharmaceutically acceptable; the citrate can be part of the buffering agents; and magnesium citrate may add a pleasant flavor for the formulation. The magnesium ions in the magnesium-containing oxytocin peptide formulation may be provided by using one or more magnesium salts. A magnesium salt in the magnesium-containing oxytocin peptide formulation may be a magnesium salt used initially in preparing of the magnesium-containing oxytocin peptide formulation, or formed in situ during preparation of the magnesium-containing oxytocin peptide formulation. For example, magnesium chloride may be used initially in preparing the formulation; and upon addition of citric acid to the formulation, magnesium citrate may be formed in situ. In such instance, the magnesium ions in the magnesium-containing oxytocin peptide formulation are provided by "
