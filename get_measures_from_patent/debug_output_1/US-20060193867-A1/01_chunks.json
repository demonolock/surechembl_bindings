    "nherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of individuals. </p> Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ration between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compounds which exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. While compounds that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such compounds to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects. </p> The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially form cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography. </p> The pharmaceutical compositions can be included in a container, pack, or dispenser together with instructions for administration. </p> Methods of Treatment </p> The present invention provides therapeutic methods of treating a subject having a cell proliferative disorder. In certain embodiments, the cell proliferative disorder is cancer. In a specific embodiment, the cell proliferative disorder is a viral associated cancer. </p> As used herein, the term \u201ctreating\u201d refers to the administration of a therapeutically effective amount of an active compound to a subject, for prophylactic and/or therapeutic purposes. The term \u201cadministration\u201d includes delivery to a subject, e.g., by any appropriate method which serves to deliver the drug to the site of the cancer. Administration of the drug can be, e.g., oral, intravenous, or topical (as described in further detail below). </p> In a one embodiment, a subject having a cell proliferative disorder is treated with an effective amount of an active compound of the invention such that the cell proliferative disorder is treated. In a specific embodiment, the subject that is being treated has cancer. </p> In one embodiment, a compositi"
