    "piratory or conjunctival epithelium. Following the primary infection, HVS persists in white blood cells for years, often for the life of the host. In contrast to Epstein-Barr virus, a lymphocryptovirus that infects humans, HVS is T-lymphotropic. In contrast to the native hosts, experimentally-infected marmosets die from a rapidly progressing neoplasia of the immune system. Upon autopsy, the organs of the reticuloendothelial systems usually exhibit extensive cellular infiltration. Persistent infection of susceptible marmosets with attenuated HVS does protect them from superinfection with wild-type virus. Other species of new world monkeys are also susceptible to neoplastic disease caused by HVS, although old world primates and humans appear to be resistant to this species of herpesvirus. HVS also cause:, lymphoproliferative disease in rabbits. Incidence of diseases in this animal model appears to be related to the type of rabbit used and the route of inoculation. \n\n The genome of HVS consists of a light component (L-DNA) that is about 34.5 % G+C, and is flanked by tandemly-repeated heavy components (H-DNA). According to the nomenclature of Albrecht et al., HVS ORFs are identified by a number representing their position within the L-DNA, and numbered from 01 to 76. The present invention relates to a protein encoded by HVS 14, an ORF present on the complementary strand of the HVS genome, which encodes a putative peptide of 249 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 28.3 Kd.</p>HVS 14 The complete nucleotide sequence of the genome of HVS has been reported</p>(Albrecht et al., J. Virol. 66:5047; 1992). Additional studies on one of the HVS open reading frames (ORFs), HVS 14, are described in Nicholas et al., Virol. 179: 1 89; 1990. HVS 14 is an immediate-early (IE) gene, and the mRNA message it encodes is detectable in cultures of infected cells immediately after removal of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, from the cultures. The HVS 14 gene is present in the Hind III-G fragment of HVS, and contains a region that exhibits similarity to a portion of a ORF in the long terminal repeat (LTR) of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). Overall, HVS 14 displays approximately 25 % identity and 46 % similarity to the product of the Mis gene of MMTV (Thompson and Nicholas, Nature 351 :530; 1991), which is believed to act as a superantigen (Choi et al., Nature 350:203; 1991 ). Other species of lymphocryptoviruses will have homologous ORFs that encode proteins similar to HVS 14.</p>As described herein, a full length HVS 14 protein was expressed, tested, and found to act as a superantigen. In contrast, an HVS 14 deletion mutant that was missing the amino terminal 33 amino acids, and which was expressed in the form of an immunoglobulin Fc fusion protein, bound MHC Class II \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains and inhibited antigen presentation. HVS 14 proteins will thus be useful regulating an immune responses in a therapeutic setting. HVS 14 proteins that bind Class II \u03b1",
    "igen presenting cells (APC), which include mononuclear phagocytes, certain dendritic cells such as Langerhans dendritic cells and follicular dendritic cells, and B cells, take up proteinaceous antigens and process them. Such processing can involve unfolding the protein or fragmentation (enzymatic and/or chemical) into smaller peptides. Processed antigens, or in the case of superantigens, unprocessed antigens, are then presented on the surface of the APC, in the form of a complex with the class II molecule. CD4+ T cells respond to APC bearing such antigen/class II complexes by proliferating and secreting lymphokines (including Interleukin-2 and Interferon-\u03b3). Class II molecules are thus central to both the humoral and cellular branches of an immune response.</p>Peptide antigens bind to Class II molecules with varying affinity, and failure to respond to certain peptide antigens has been associated with the inability of particular Class II molecules to bind the peptide. The original identification of these molecules came from the discovery that allelic variations within the regions encoding MHC Class I (HLA-D region in humans and H-2I region in the mouse) resulted in stimulation in mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC) in vitro, and led to graft rejections in vivo. Class II antigens are composed of two non-covalently associated polypeptide chains designated \u03b1 and \u03b2. The o chain is an acidic polypeptide with two external, structural domains and an approximate molecular weight of 25-33 kD. The \u03b2 chain is a basic polypeptide of 24-29 kD in molecular weight, and also has two external structural domains. \n\nBoth chains are glycosylated transmembrane proteins and contain a highly conserved region of ten to twelve peptides linking the membrane proximal domain to the hydrophobic transmembrane region. The higher molecular weight of the \u03b1 chain is generally accounted for by the presence of two carbohydrate moieties, a complex type oligosaccharide and a high mannose type. The \u03b2 chain contains a single complex type carbohydrate.</p>Additional information regarding the structure and function of MHC Class II antigens may be found in many general immunology textbooks (for example, Fundamental</p>Immunology. Second Edition; W.E. Paul, Ed. Raven Press, 1993), as well as in descriptions of the numerous scientific studies that have been performed.</p>Proteins and Analogs</p>The present invention provides isolated HVS 14 proteins having immunoregulatory activity. Such proteins are substantially free of contaminating endogenous materials and, optionally, without associated native-pattern glycosylation. Derivatives of the HVS 14 proteins within the scope of the invention also include various structural forms of the primary protein which retain biological activity. Due to the presence of ionizable amino and carboxyl groups, for example, an HVS 14 protein may be in the form of acidic or basic salts, or may be in neutral form. Individual amino acid residues may also be modified by oxidation or reduction. The primary amino acid ",

Cells were preincubated with 20 \u03bcg/ml of antibodies to MHC class II (Becton Dickinson) at 4\u00b0C for 1 hr before the addition of HVS 14/ Fc protein. Cells were subsequently stained as described above. The results were shown in Figure 2. Preincubation of cells with anti-HLA DR monoclonal antibody inhibited 97% of HVS 14 Fc binding to DG75 cells (Figure 2b), whereas preincubation with anti-DP (Figure 2c), anti-DQ (Figure 2d) or anti-class I (Figure 2a) monoclonal antibodies did not inhibit the HVS 14 Fc binding. \n\n To demonstrate that the full length HVS 14 can also bind to MHC class II, an inhibition experiment was performed using full-length HVS 14 transfected supernatants to inhibit binding of the cells with HVS14/Fc. The results were shown in Figure 2e. These results demonstrated that the full length native form HVS14, like HVS 14/Fc fusion protein, was able to bind MHC class II DR molecules on the cell surfaces.</p>Direct binding of HVS14/Fc to MHC class II molecules were assessed using a slide binding assay, substantially as described by Gearing et al. (EMBO J. 8:3667, 1989). Adherent CVl/EBNA cells were cultured on microslides, and transfected with the MHC class II \u03b1, \u03b2 or \u03b1 plus \u03b2 chains. Two days later, cells were washed with binding medium containing 5 % dry milk, and incubated with 1 \u03bcg/ml of HVS14/Fc protein, control Fc protein or 1 \u03bcg/ml of the monoclonal antibodies previously described. Subsequently, cells were washed, incubated with 125\u03c4_]<sub>a</sub>b<sub>e</sub>\u03b9<sub>e(</sub>j g<sub>\u03b8at</sub> anti-human IgG, or sheep anti-mouse IgG (New England Nuclear, Cambridge, MA). Cells were washed with binding medium followed by PBS, fixed in PBS containing 2.5 % glutaraldehyde, washed again with PBS and air dried. The chamber slides were then dipped in Kodak GTNB-2 photographic emulsion and exposed for two days at 4\u00b0C before developing. The results are shown in Table 2.

Trimeric HVS 14 comprises a leader sequence, and a 33 amino acid sequence referred to as a \"trimeric oligmerizing zipper\" (SEQ ID NO:6; USSN 07/969,703, filed October 23, 1992), followed by ",
    "was propagated in owl monkey kidney (OMK) monolayers. The virus infected or mock infected cells were labeled with 300 \u03bcCi/ml [35s]methionine and cysteine for 16 hours. Supernatants were harvested and precipitated as described below.</p>For immunoprecipitation, 50 \u03bcl of supernatant or cell lysate and 1 \u03bcl of polyclonal antiserum or normal mouse serum were added to 200 \u03bcl of lysis buffer and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 60 minutes. The antibody-antigen complexes were then incubated with protein A- sepharose beads for an additional hour and washed five times with PBS containing 1 % \n\ndeoxycholate, 1% Nonidet p-40 and 0.1% SDS. The protein A beads were resuspended in Laemmli buffer (Laemmli, U.K., Nature 227:680; 1970) with or without 2- mercaptoethanol. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed on 8-16% polyacrylamide gradient gels containing 0.1% SDS. Gels were prepared for fluorography, dried and exposed to radiographic film (Kodak) for 12 to 72 hours.</p>The oligosaccharide structure of the HVS 14 protein was investigated using N- glycanase, neuraminidase (sialidase), and endo-\u03b1-N acetylgalactosaminidase (O- glycanase), substantially as described by Robbins et al. (Cell 12:893. 1977) and Yao et al. (J. Virol. 67:305, 1993). Additional studies were carried out with tunicamycin, which inhibits the addition of N-linked oligosaccharides to glycoproteins. Reagents were purchased from either Sigma or Genzyme (Cambridge, MA).</p>Supernatant from HVS 14 transfected cells contained a heterogeneous 50 kd protein that reacted specifically with the HVS 14 antiserum. A similar size protein band was present in the HVS infected cell supernatants, but not in the mock-infected OMK cell supernatants. In the transfected cell lysates, the same 50 kd protein band, as well as an additional 38 kd protein was present. Immunoprecipitates electrophoresed under reducing or nonreducing conditions were essentially indistinguishable, suggesting that HVS14 does not dimerize through disulfide bonds.</p>The apparent difference between the actual and the predicted molecular weight (28 kd) and the heterogeneity of the protein band suggested that this protein was glycosylated. In the presence of tunicamycin, the 50 kd species disappeared, while a protein of approximately 40 kd was detected in the transfected cell supernatants. In the cell lysates, the 50 kd protein shifted to 40 kd, while the 38 kd protein shifted to 28 kd, indicating that both the 50 kd protein and the 38 kd protein contain N-linked carbohydrate moieties. The 28 kd protein likely represents the backbone of the HVS 14 protein, which is consistent with the predicted molecular weight.</p>The N-glycanase digestion results were virtually identical to those obtained with tunicamycin treatment. The presence of a 40 kd protein species in the presence of tunicamycin suggested that the HVS 14 backbone (28 kd) was further modified, possibly by O-linked glycosylation. To determine whether HVS 14 contained O-linked oligosaccharides, the cell lysates from transfected cells were subjected to serial neuraminidase and O-glycanase digestion. Removal of N-acetylneuraminic acid residues generated a protein with a molecular weight of 42 kd, and subsequent treatment with O- glycanase caused a further shift of HVS 14 from 42 kd to 38 kd. These results demonstrate that HVS 14 also contains O-linked glycans. \n\n SEQUENCE LISTING</p>(1) GENERAL INFORMATION:</p>(i) APPLICANT: Yao, Zhengbin</p>Spriggs, Melanie Armitage, Richard Alderson, Mark</p>(ii) TITLE OF INVENTION: Isolated Herpesvirus Saimiri Proteins That</p>Bind MHC Class II Molecules</p>(iii) NUMBER OF SEQUENCES: 7</p>(iv) CORRESPONDENCE ADDRESS:</p>(A) ADDRESSEE: Immunex Corporation</p>(B) STREET: 51 University Street</p>(C) CITY: Seattle (D) STATE: WA</p>(E) COUNTRY: USA</p>(F) ZIP: 98101</p>(v) COMPUTER READABLE FORM: (A) MEDIUM TYPE: Floppy disk</p>(B) COMPUTER: Apple Macintosh</p>(C) OPERATING SYSTEM: Apple Operating System 7.1</p>(D) SOFTWARE: Microsoft Word for Apple, Version 5.1a (vi) CURRENT APPLICATION DATA:</p>(A) APPLICATION NUMBER:</p>(B) FILING DATE: 07-DEC-1995</p>(C) CLASSIFICATION: (vii) PRIOR APPLICATION DATA:</p>(A) APPLICATION NUMBER: USSN 08/351,901</p>(B) FILING DATE: 07-DEC-1994</p>(C) CLASSIFICATION: (vii) PRIOR APPLICATION DATA:</p>(A) APPLICATION NUMBER: USSN 08/485,549</p>(B) FILING DATE: 06-JUN-1995</p>(C) CLASSIFICATION: (viii) ATTORNEY/AGENT INFORMATION:</p>(A) NAME: Perkins, Patricia Anne</p>(B) REGISTRATION NUMBER: 34,693</p>(C) REFERENCE/DOCKET NUMBER: 2615-WO (ix) TELECOMMUNICATION INFORMATION:</p>(A) TELEPHONE: (206)587-0430</p>(B) TELEFAX: (206)233-0644</p>(2) INFORMATION FOR SEQ ID NO: 1 :</p>(i) SEQUENCE CHARACTERISTICS:</p>(A) LENGTH: 249 amino acids</p>(B) TYPE: amino acid (C) STRANDEDNESS : single</p>(D) TOPOLOG"
