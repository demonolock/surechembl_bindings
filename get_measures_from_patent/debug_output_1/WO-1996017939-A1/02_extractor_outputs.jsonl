Two days later, cells were washed with binding medium containing 5 % dry milk, and incubated with 1 \u03bcg/ml of HVS14/Fc protein, control Fc protein or 1 \u03bcg/ml of the monoclonal antibodies previously described. \nCells were washed with binding medium followed by PBS, fixed in PBS containing 2.5 % glutaraldehyde, washed again with PBS and air dried."}
