The entirety of the disclosure herein, including the specifics thereof, are intended to be exemplary and not limiting. </p> It is well established that the free radical oxygen atoms (140) liberated from peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide (130), carbamide peroxide, and salts of peroxides formed from the alkali and alkaline earth metals, readily attack and oxidize organic molecules (160) that comprise the stains in discolored dental appliances.

    "eaction to a stop. Indeed the K value for step 1350 the \u201cdisproportionation\u201d reaction is high being ten to the 8 power, but in order to replace the IOH molecule (1321) consumed in the reaction one must take the Iodide ion (1352) produced by the reaction and plug it back into either step 1320 or step 1340 in which the K values are low. Experimentally, in our lab, we combined 0.294 moles of Hydrogen Peroxide with 0.000602 moles of Iodide in basic solution; a solution in which Hydrogen Peroxide is in very great excess relative to the Iodide. The great excess of Hydrogen Peroxide was completely depleted within thirty minutes in a reaction that started slowly but built into a very rapid reaction. Our experimental observation, therefore, discounts the mechanism. In addition, when one studies the elementary steps suggested by Kessi-Rabbia one notices that the oxidation state of Iodine is never greater than plus 1. Because the other halogens, particularly bromide and chloride, exhibit similar plus 1 oxidation state chemistry, it is reasonable to assume that if the plus 1 oxidation state is the only oxidation state used, the Chloride or Bromide ion would also work in the reaction. </p> Experimentally, in our lab, the replacement of the Iodide ion with equal quantities and then excess quantities of the Chloride ion or Bromide ion produced no reaction at all over extended periods. We went a step further and conducted two additional experiments. </p> In the first reaction 0.100 grams of KI (0.000602 mole of Iodide) was combined with 0.100 grams of KCl (0.00134 mole of Chloride) and 0.059 grams of KOH in a 10% solution of Hydrogen Peroxide. The pH and Temperature were measured every minute for 40 minutes. A standard solution was then prepared that was identical to the test solution except the KCl was not added. A plot of the data is presented in FIG. 1400. The slope of the reaction temperature (1420 and 1425) and pH change (1410 and 1415) are virtually identical meaning that the addition of excess Chloride (1415 and 1425), relative to Iodide, had no effect on the reaction; chloride neither slowed nor hastened the reaction: it did not play a role. To validate the statement we conducted an experiment in which we increased the concentration of KI over six separate reactions. We first prepared a stock solution which contained a 0.0106 molar concentration of KOH and a 3.235 molar (11%) concentration of Hydrogen Peroxide. This stock solution was then carefully measured out into 100 gram lots for the six separate reactions. To the first reaction 0.050 grams (0.000301 moles or 0.05%) of KI were added. To the second reaction 0.100 grams (0.000602 moles or 0.1%) of KI were added. To the third reaction 0.150 grams (0.000903 moles or 0.15%) KI were added. To the forth reaction 0.200 grams (0.001205 moles or 0.20%) KI were added. To the fifth reaction 0.250 grams (0.001506 moles or 0.25%) KI were added. The sixth reaction contained 80 grams of stock solution to which 0.240 grams (0.00145 moles or 0.30%) KI were added. In each reaction the pH and Temperature values were taken and recorded every minute. The data from these reactions were plotted and are presented in FIG. 1900. The lowest concentration of KI used in this series was 0.05% (1910). The KI concentration was then doubled to 0.10% (1920). The concentration of KI was then increased an additional five tenths of one percent to 0.15% (1930). The concentration of KI was then increased an additional five tenths of one percent to 0.20% (1940). The concentration of KI was then increased an additional five tenths of one percent to 0.25% (1950). The concentration of KI was then increased an additional five tenths of one percent to 0.30% (1960). As the curves (1910, 1920, 1930, 1940, 1950, and 1960) compared it becomes clear that as the concentration of the Iodide ion is increased the reaction rate is substantially increased. From the results of this study one would expect that if Chloride plays any sort of a catalytic role the rate would substantially increase. As it can clearly be seen in FIG. 1400 no such increase exists. Chloride cannot initiate, sustain, or increase the rate of this reaction. This determination is quite important in that Chlorine has every allowable oxidation state that Iodine has: +/\u22121, +5, +7 and Chlorine even has an additional oxidation state that is not allowed in Iodine: +3. Of course the energy levels of Chlorine's oxidation states are quite a bit higher than Iodine because it is much smaller and much more electronegative. A closer match in size and electronegativity is Bromine. </p> The second experiment was a similar experiment with Bromine. 0.101 grams of KI (0.000608 moles of Iodide) were combined with 0.101 grams of KBr (0.000848 moles of Bromide) and 0.059 grams of KOH in a 10% solution of Hydrogen Peroxide. Again the pH (1510 and 1515) and Temperature (1520 and 1525) were measured every minute for 40 minutes and again, a standard solution identical to the test solution with the notable exception that the Bromide had not been added was prepared and measured in the same manner with the same equipment. The data collected from these reactions is plotted in FIG. 1500. Again the slope of the line, not the ultimate magnitude, determines the rate of the reaction. The slope of the Bromide reaction (1515 and 1525) and the slope of the Iodide reaction (1510 and 1520) are virtually identical; statistically they are identical. To validate this statement we conducted an experiment in which the KI concentration is increased. A discussion of the experiment can be found above in the Chloride ion discussion. </p> The results of the KI concentration study are plotted in FIG. 1900. As is clearly demonstrated in FIG. 1900 the reaction increased substantially when additional Iodide was added further proving that Bromide, as is true with Chloride, plays no part in this reaction. Bromide cannot initiate, sustain, or increase the rate of this reaction. This finding is important because the size, electronegativity, and orbital configuration of Bromine is a much closer match to Iodine than is Chorine. With respect to the orbital configuration Iodine and Bromine both possess D orbitals whereas Chorine does not. There are two functional differences: The first is that Iodine possess a 4D orbital and Bromine possess a 3D. The second is the allowable oxidation states. Bromine has three allowable oxidation states: +/\u22121, +5. Iodine has four allowable oxidation states: +/\u22121, +5, +7. It can be argued that it is the +7 oxidation state and the D4 orbital that makes all the difference and allows the reaction to proceed. However, that argument cannot be applied to the mechanisms described by Kessi-Rabbia. Kessi-Rabbia's mechanism allows for only the +1 oxidation state. In such a +1 oxidation state mechanism, even though chemically different, other halogens, particularly Bromine, would be expected to produce the reaction to some degree. Our research clearly demonstrates that they do not. Kessi-Rabbia mechanism, in short, fails to describe the reaction of Iodide with Peroxide in basic solution. The short fall may be caused by ",

Mendeleev Communications (1994), (1), 25-7. </p> The above cited references are hereby incorporated by reference. </p> We determined, from the references, that there were two different free radical scavengers that were readily available and safe to use: Ethanol and Benzoate. Ethanol and Benzoate are effective Hydroxyl Radical (HO.) scavengers. </p> Two series of experiments were conducted, one in an acidic medium and one in a basic medium. </p> In the acidic medium, three solutions were prepared containing a final concentration of 10% Hydrogen Peroxide. To the first 100 gram, standard solution, 0.102 grams of KI (0.000614 mole of Iodide) was added and the pH and Temperature were measured and recorded every minute. The second solution contained 97.5 grams of aqueous Hydrogen Peroxide to which 2.500 grams of Sodium Benzoate was added. 0.102 grams of KI (0.000614 mole of Iodide) was added to the solution and the pH and Temperature were measured and recorded every minute. The third 100 gram solution was prepared containing 50% Ethanol. 0.102 grams of KI (0.000614 mole of Iodide) was added to the solution and the pH and Temperature were measured and recorded every minute. </p> The data were collected, plotted and are presented in FIG. 1600. The slope of the Standard reaction (1610), in which no Benzoate or Ethanol was added, is approximately 0.6-0.7 degrees per minute. The slope of the Benzoate reaction (1620) is approximately 0.4-0.5 degrees per minute. The slope of the Ethanol reaction (1630) is approximately 0.2-0.3 degrees per minute. </p> In the basic medium, three solutions were prepared containing a final concentration of 10% Hydrogen Peroxide. To the first 100 gram, standard solution, 0.060 grams of KOH (0.00107 mole) and 0.150 grams of KI (0.000904 mole of Iodide) were added and the pH and Temperature were measured and recorded every minute. The second solution contained 97.5 grams of aqueous Hydrogen Peroxide to which 2.500 grams of Sodium Benzoate was added. 0.060 grams of KOH (0.00107 mole) and 0.150 grams of KI (0.000904 mole of Iodide) were added to the solution and the pH and Temperature were measured and recorded every minute. The third 100 gram solution was prepared containing 50% Ethanol. 0.060 grams of KOH (0.00107 mole) and 0.150 grams of KI (0.000904 mole of Iodide) were added to the solution and the pH and Temperature were measured and recorded every minute. </p> The data were collected, plotted and are presented in FIG. 1700. The slope of the Standard reaction (1710), in which no Benzoate or Ethanol was added, rose sharply and attained a slope in excess of 2.0 degrees in one minute. The slope of the Benzoate reaction (1720) is approximately 1.2-1.4 degrees per minute once a steady state was achieved. The slope of the Ethanol reaction (1730) is approximately 0.6-0.7 degrees per minute. </p> As one can clearly see in FIGS. 1600 and 1700 the addition of Benzoate or Ethanol slowed the reaction rate in both the acidic medium and the basic medium. Because both Ethanol and Benzoate are known to be and are commonly used as Hydroxyl Radical (HO.) scavengers the obvious conclusion is that Hydroxyl Radicals (HO.) play a role in the reaction whether in acidic medium or basic medium. By way of confirmation that it was the influence of a Hydroxyl Radical scavenger that affected the reaction and not simply the presence of additional ions in the solution, two additional studies were conducted using an inorganic salt, Potassium Nitrate, and an organic salt, Potassium Citrate. A stock 10% Hydrogen Peroxide solution was prepared in a basic medium and 0.2% KI was added. A Standard reaction was conducted and the pH and Temperature was measured and recorded every minute. A second reaction was conducted in which all concentrations remained identical except that the solution contained 2.5% Potassium Citrate. A third reaction was conducted in which all concentrations, again, remained the same as the standard. The only change in the third reaction was the solution contained 2.5% Potassium Nitrate. Again, the Temperature and pH values were collected and recorded every minute. </p> The data from these reactions were plotted in the graph depicted in FIG. 1800. The slope for the Standard reaction curve (1810), the Potassium Nitrate reaction curve (1820), and the Potassium Citrate containing reaction curve (1830) are virtually identical indicating that these salts had no effect on the reaction. </p> Based on the results of the reactions which are graphed in FIGS. 1600, 1700, and 1800, the obvious conclusion is that the Iodide catalyzed reaction of Hydrogen Peroxide is not the \u201cdisproportionation\u201d of Hydrogen Peroxide in which bimolecular Oxygen is generated directly from the Hydrogen Peroxide molecule described by Kessi-Rabbia, but is a reaction in which, at least in part, free radicals, in particular the Hydroxyl Free Radical (HO.) plays an important role. </p> The realization that the reaction, in fact, involves free radicals brings us to the remaining two reference citations mentioned earlier, namely: Oscillations in chemical systems. ",
    "t took us 1 year of frustration before we realized oscillations would only be possible at oxygen concentrations so great that all of the initial hydrogen peroxide would be destroyed long before the necessary conditions were attained.\u201d And \u201cWe must admit failure to model closed system behavior well, and at the present time the direction for continued efforts are unclear.\u201d. </p> As noted by these researchers the ionic catalyzed \u201cdecomposition\u201d of peroxides is a very difficult system to quantify. Far and away the most research has been done in acidic medium and the two citations discussed above are a very good distillation of that work. It was our endeavor to determine which of the sequences discovered and quantified in acidic medium reactions could be applied to the basic medium reactions. To that end we studied the cited work and realized that the lodate ion (FIGS. 2300 (2320) and 2000 (2008 and 2011)) were central to the reaction. To that end we prepared a basic medium reaction and added amounts equal to the Iodide ion, and then amounts in great excess. The addition of the lodate anion did not initiate any reaction even over extended amounts of time. We reasoned, as mentioned by Sharma, that the presence of the Iodide ion may be requisite for the reaction to proceed. To that end we prepared another reaction in which a 10% Hydrogen Peroxide stock solution containing 0.00357 molar concentration of KOH was prepared. In the first Standard reaction 0.120 grams (0.000722 moles) of KI was added to 100 grams of the stock solution. The pH and Temperature values were taken and recorded every minute. In the second reaction 0.120 grams (0.000722 moles) of KI and 0.102 grams (0.000477 moles) of Potassium lodate were added to 100 grams of the stock solution. The pH and Temperature values were taken and recorded every minute. The data was then plotted and those curves are presented in FIG. 2400. As can clearly be seen the rate of the reaction of the Standard solution (2410) and the rate of the reaction of the Potassium lodate solution (2420) are virtually identical: the reaction rate was the same for the Standard solution and the Potassium lodate solution. If the lodate anion plays an essential role in the basic medium as was clearly demonstrated by Sharma and Edelson in the acidic medium, one would expect that the addition of the lodate ion would increase the reaction rate. One would expect to find an increase at least as large as is obtained when one increases the Iodide ion concentration as is illustrated in FIG. 1900. A full discussion of this experiment is present under the Chloride ion discussion above. In brief, the lowest concentration of KI used in this series was 0.05% (1910). The KI concentration was then doubled to 0.10% (1920). The concentration of KI was then increased an additional five tenths of one percent to 0.15% (1930). The concentration of KI was then increased an additional five tenths of one percent to 0.20% (1940). The concentration of KI was then increased an additional five tenths of one percent to 0.25% (1950). The concentration of KI was then increased an additional five tenths of one percent to 0.30% (1960). Clearly as the concentration of Iodide ion increases the rate of the reaction increases. However, refer to FIG. 2400, when the lodate ion is added no such increase or decrease in the reaction rate occurs: the lodate ion plays no role in the basic medium ionic catalytic \u201cdecomposition\u201d of peroxides. </p> There is one major additional difference between the acidic medium reaction and the basic medium reaction: the acidic medium reaction is very pH sensitive, the basic medium reaction is not. As long as the solution is decidedly basic, at a pH of 9 or above, the reaction proceeds well. </p> One further experimental note; Fluoride being so very electronegative and small was not considered a player in these determinations. Non-the-less an initiation experiment was conducted in which an identical and then very excess amount of Fluoride ion, obtained from Potassium Fluoride, was substituted in the solution for Iodide. After an extended amount of time no reaction was noted. Again, because of the vast chemical differences between Fluorine and Iodine further studies were not conducted. Astatine was not considered because of the availability and health issues involved in dealing with it. </p> Through the course of our trials we have determined that both the acidic medium and basic medium ionic catalytic \u201cdecomposition\u201d of peroxides involve free radicals. In fact, there are a large number of different types o"
