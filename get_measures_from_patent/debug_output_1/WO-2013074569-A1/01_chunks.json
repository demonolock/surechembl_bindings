    " IL-36R\" each refers to a humanized anti-IL-36R antibody having at least a light chain variable murine CDR. Variants include those having one or more amino acid changes in one or both light chain or heavy chain variable domains, provided that the amino acid change does not substantially impair binding of the antibody to IL-36R. </p> An \"isolated\" antibody is one that has been identified and separated and/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of the antibody's natural environment are those materials that may interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses of the antibody, and can be enzymes, hormones, or other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In one aspect, the antibody will be purified to at least greater than 95% isolation by weight of antibody. </p> An isolated antibody includes an antibody in situ within recombinant cells in which it is produced, since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily however, an isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step in which the recombinant cellular material is removed. </p>The term \"antibody performance\" refers to factors that contribute to antibody recognition of antigen or the effectiveness of an antibody in vivo. Changes in the amino acid sequence of an antibody can affect antibody properties such as folding, and can influence physical factors such as initial rate of antibody binding to antigen (k<sub>a</sub>), dissociation constant of the antibody from antigen (kd), affinity constant of the antibody \n\n for the antigen (Kd), conformation of the antibody, protein stability, and half life of the antibody. </p> The term \"epitope tagged\" when used herein, refers to an anti-IL-36R antibody fused to an \"epitope tag\". An \"epitope tag\" is a polypeptide having a sufficient number of amino acids to provide an epitope for antibody production, yet is designed such that it does not interfere with the desired activity of the humanized anti-IL-36R antibody. The epitope tag is usually sufficiently unique such that an antibody raised against the epitope tag does not substantially cross-react with other epitopes. Suitable tag polypeptides generally contain at least 6 amino acid residues and usually contain about 8 to 50 amino acid residues, or about 9 to 30 residues. Examples of epitope tags and the antibody that binds the epitope include the flu HA tag polypeptide and its antibody 12CA5 (Field et al., 1988 Mol. Cell. Biol. 8: 2159-2165; c-myc tag and 8F9, 3C7, 6E10, G4, B7 and 9E10 antibodies thereto (Evan et al., 1985, Mol. Cell. Biol. 5(12):3610-3616; and Herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D (gD) tag and its antibody (Paborsky et al. 1990, Protein Engineering 3(6): 547-553). In certain embodiments, the epitope tag is a \"salvage receptor binding epitope\". As used herein, the term \"salvage receptor binding epitope\" refers to an epitope of the Fc region of an IgG molecule (such as Igd , lgG<sub>2</sub>, lgG<sub>3</sub>, or lgG<sub>4</sub>) that is responsible for increasing the in vivo serum half-life of the I"
