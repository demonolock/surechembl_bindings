    "ided as a lyophilized mixture with the adjunct ingredients, or the adjunct ingredients can be separately provided for combination by the user. Generally these adjunct materials will be present in less than about 5% by weight based on the amount of active antibody, and usually will be present in a total amount of at least about 0.001% by weight based on antibody concentration. Where a second antibody or antigen-binding fragment capable of binding to the anti-HMGB antibody or antigen-binding fragment is employed, such antibody or fragment can be provided in the kit, for instance in a separate vial or container. The second antibody or antigen-binding fragment, if present, is typically labeled, and can be formulated in an analogous manner with the antibody formulations described above. The antibodies, antigen-binding fragments and/or ancillary reagent of the kit can be packaged separately or together within suitable containment means (e.g., bottle, box, envelope, tube). When the kit comprises a plurality of individually packaged components, the individual packages can be contained within a single larger containment means (e.g., bottle, box, envelope, tube).</p>Methods of ScreeningIn another embodiment, the invention is a method of detecting or identifying an agent that binds to an HMGB polypeptide (e.g., a mammalian HMGB polypeptide (e.g., an HMGB1 polypeptide)). In one embodiment, the method of detecting or identifying an agent that binds to an HMGB polypeptide is a competitive binding assay in which the ability of a test agent to inhibit the binding of an antibody or antigen-binding fragment of the invention is assessed. For example, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment can be labeled with a suitable label as described herein, and the amount of labeled antibody or antigen-binding fragment required to saturate the HMGB polypeptide present in the assay can be determined. For example, a saturating amount of labeled antibody or antigen-binding fragment and various amounts of a test agent can be contacted with an HMGB polypeptide under conditions suitable for binding, and complex formation determined. In this type of assay, a decrease in the amount of complex formed between the labeled antibody or antigen-binding fragment and HMGB polypeptide indicates that the test agent binds to the HMGB polypeptide. In another embodiment, the HMGB polypeptide can be labeled. Suitable labels for labeling antibodies, antigen-binding fragments and/or HMGB polypeptides include those described above.</p>A variety of agents, such as proteins (e.g., antibodies), peptides, peptidomimetics, small organic molecules, nucleic acids and the like, can be tested for binding to an HMGB polypeptide (e.g., a mammalian HMGB polypeptide (e.g., an HMGB1 polypeptide)). According to the method of the present invention, agents can be individually screened or one or more agents can be tested simultaneously. Where a mixture of compounds is tested, the compounds selected by the processes d"
