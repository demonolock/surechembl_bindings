{"raw_mentions": "A cell line T47D/MMTV-5 was isolated which responds to aldosterone (EC<sub>50</sub><sup>ald </sup>100 nM), and progesterone (EC<sub>50</sub><sup>prog </sup>10 nM), leading to expression of luciferase.\nAs for the GR assay to test for MR- or PR-antagonists, the T47D/MMTV-5 cells are incubated with several dilutions of the compounds in the presence of the 5\u00d7EC<sub>50 </sub>of the agonist aldosterol (EC<sub>50</sub><sup>ald </sup>100 nM) or progesterone (EC<sub>50</sub><sup>prog </sup>10 nM) respectively.\nMineralocorticoid binding assay: MR was obtained from Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus containing MR, and the MR was isolated according to the method of Binart et al (Binart, N.; Lombes, M.; Rafestin-Oblin, M. E.; Baulieu, E. E. Characterisation of human mineralocorticoid receptor expressed in the baculovirus system. PNAS US, 1991, 88, 10681-10685). Compounds were tested against an appropriate dilution of the MR (determined for each batch of receptor) with 2.4 nM of [<sup>3</sup>H] aldosterone (Perkin Elmer NET419) and incubated for 60 mins at room temperature.\nEstrogen binding assay: Compounds were tested for displacement of 0.56 nM [<sup>3</sup>H]-estradiol (Perkin Elmer NET517) binding to 0.5 nM ER\u03b1 (obtained from PanVera 26467A) following an incubation period of 90 mins at room temperature.\nProgesterone binding assay: Compounds were tested for displacement of 3 nM [<sup>3</sup>H]-progesterone (Perkin Elmer NET381) binding to 1 nM PR (obtained from PanVera 24900).\nAndrogen binding assay: Compounds were tested, in triplicate, for displacement of 6 nM [<sup>3</sup>H]-dihydrotestosterone (Perkin Elmer NET453) binding to 3 nM PR (obtained from PanVera 24938).\nAll compounds tested showed Ki's of greater than 100 nM for MR, ER, PR, and/or AR receptors."}
