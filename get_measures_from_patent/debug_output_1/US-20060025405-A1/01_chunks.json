    "UND OF THE INVENTION  In most species, including man, the physiological glucocorticoid is cortisol (hydrocortisone). Glucocorticoids are secreted in response to ACTH (corticotropin), which shows both circadian rhythm variation and elevations in response to stress and food. Cortisol levels are responsive within minutes to many physical and psychological stresses, including trauma, surgery, exercise, anxiety and depression. Cortisol is a steroid and acts by binding to an intracellular, glucocorticoid receptor (GR). In man, glucocorticoid receptors are present in two forms: a ligand-binding GR-alpha of 777 amino acids; and, a GR-beta isoform which differs in only the last fifteen amino acids. The two types of GR have high affinity for their specific ligands, and are considered to function through the same transduction pathways. </p> The biologic effects of cortisol, including those caused by hypercortisolemia, can be modulated at the GR level using receptor modulators, such as agonists, partial agonists and antagonists. Several different classes of agents are able to block the physiologic effects of GR-agonist binding. These antagonists include compositions which, by binding to GR, block the ability of an agonist to effectively bind to and/or activate the GR. One such known GR antagonist, mifepristone, has been found to be an effective anti-glucocorticoid agent in humans (Bertagna (1984) J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 59:25). Mifepristone binds to the GR with high affinity, with a dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) of 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>M (Cadepond (1997) Annu. Rev. Med. 48:129). </p> Patients with some forms of psychiatric illnesses have been found to have increased levels of cortisol (Krishnan (1992) Prog. Neuro-Psychophannacol. &amp; Biol. Psychiat. 16:913-920). For example, some depressed individuals can be responsive to treatments which block the effect of cortisol, as by administering GR antagonists (Van Look (1995) Human Reproduction Update 1: 19-34). In one study, a patient with depression secondary to Cushing's Syndrome (hyperadrenocorticism) was responsive to a high dose, up to 1400 mg per day, of GR antagonist mifepristone (Nieman (1985) J. Clin Endocrinol. Metab. 61:536). Another study which used mifepristone to treat Cushing's syndrome found that it improved the patients' conditions, including their psychiatric status (Chrousos, pp 273-284, In: Baulieu, ed. The Antiprogestin Steroid RU 486 and Human Fertility Control. Plenum Press, New York (1989), Sartor (1996) Clin. Obstetrics and Gynecol. 39:506-510). </p> Psychosis has also been associated with Cushing's syndrome (Gerson (1985) Can. J. Psychiatry 30:223-224; Saad (1984) Am. J. Med. 76:759-766). Mifepristone has been used to treat acute psychiatric disturbances secondary to Cushing's syndrome. One study showed that a relatively high dose of mifepristone (400 to 800 mg per day) was useful in rapidly reversing acute psychosis in patients with severe Cushing Syndrome due to adrenal cancers",

The source of the receptor was recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cells. This GR was a full-length steroid hormone receptor likely to be associated with heat-shock and other endogenous proteins. </p> The assay was carried out in v-bottomed 96-well polypropylene plates in a final volume of 200 \u03bcl containing 0.5 nM GR solution, 2.5 nM 3H-dexamethasone (Amersham TRK 645) in presence of test compounds, test compound vehicle (for total binding) or excess dexamethasone (20 \u03bcM, to determine non-specific binding) in an appropriate volume of assay buffer. </p> For the Primary Screen, test compounds were tested at 1 \u03bcM in duplicate. These compounds were diluted from 10 mM stock in 100% DMSO. After dilution to 100 \u03bcM, 5 \u03bcl were added to 245 \u03bcl assay buffer to obtained 2 \u03bcM compound and 2% DMSO. </p> For the IC<sub>50 </sub>determinations, test compounds were tested at 6 concentrations in duplicate (concentration range depends on % inhibition binding that was obtained in the Primary Screen,). Test compounds were diluted from 10 mM stock in 100% DMSO. The tested solutions were prepared at 2\u00d7final assay concentration in 2% DMSO/assay buffer. </p> All reagents and the assay plate were kept on ice during the addition of reagents. The reagents were added to wells of a v-bottomed polypropylene plate in the following order: 50 \u03bcl of 10 nM 3H-dexamethasone solution, 100 \u03bcl of TB/NSB/compound solution and 50 \u03bcl of 2 nM GR solution. After the additions, the incubation mixture was mixed and incubated for 2.5 hrs at 4\u00b0 C. </p> After 2.5 hrs incubation, unbound counts were removed with dextran coated charcoal (DCC) as follows: 25 \u03bcl of DCC solution (10% DCC in assay buffer) was added to all wells and mixed (total volume 225 \u03bcl). The plate was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. 75 \u03bcl of the supernatants (i.e. \u2153 of total volume) was carefully pipetted into an optiplate. 200 \u03bcl of scintillation cocktail were added (Microscint-40, Packard Bioscience. B.V.). The plate was vigorously shaken for approx. 10 minutes and counted on Topcount. </p> For the IC<sub>50 </sub>determinations, the results were calculated as % inhibition [<sup>3</sup>H]-dexamethasone bound and fitted to sigmoidal curves (fixed to 100 and 0) to obtain IC<sub>50 </sub>values (concentration of compound that displaces 50% of the bound counts). The IC<sub>50 </sub>values were converted to K<sub>i </sub>(the inhibition constant) using the Cheng-Prusoff equation. Test results are presented in Table 2 for selected compounds of the Invention.

As for the SW1353 cell line, T47D cells have been transfected with the same pMAMneo-Luc plasmid, and stable lines selected with geneticin. A cell line T47D/MMTV-5 was isolated which responds to aldosterone (EC<sub>50</sub><sup>ald </sup>100 nM), and progesterone (EC<sub>50</sub><sup>prog </sup>10 nM), leading to expression of luciferase. </p> As for the GR assay to test for MR- or PR-antagonists, the T47D/MMTV-5 cells are incubated with several dilutions of the compounds in the presence of the 5\u00d7EC<sub>50 </sub>of the agonist aldosterol (EC<sub>50</sub><sup>ald </sup>100 nM) or progesterone (EC<sub>50</sub><sup>prog </sup>10 nM) respectively. For each assay, a dose response curve is prepared for both aldosterone and progesterone. </p> T47D/MMTV-5 cells are distributed in 96-well plates (100 \u03bcl) in RPM11640 medium +10% Charcoal stripped FCS. The cells are incubated for 24 hrs in the CO<sub>2</sub>-oven. A volume of 100 \u03bcl of the compound dilutions in medium+agonist (500 nM aldost; 50 nM progest) are added, and the plates further incubated for another 24 hrs after which the luciferase expression is measured. </p>EXAMPLE 10 Selectivity Binding Assays  Selectivity binding assays were performed against human estrogen (ER\u03b1), progesterone (PR), androgen (AR) and mineralocorticoid (MR) receptors. The selectivity assays were carried out in the same assay buffer and volumes as the GR binding assay and DCC was used to separate free from bound label. </p> Mineralocorticoid binding assay: MR was obtained from Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus containing MR, and the MR was isolated according to the method of Binart et al (Binart, N.; Lombes, M.; Rafestin-Oblin, M. E.; Baulieu, E. E. Characterisation of human mineralocorticoid receptor expressed in the baculovirus system. PNAS US, 1991, 88, 10681-10685).

This assay was incubated for 120 mins at 4\u00b0 C. </p> Androgen binding assay: Compounds were tested, in triplicate, for displacement of 6 nM [<sup>3</sup>H]-dihydrotestosterone (Perkin Elmer NET453) binding to 3 nM PR (obtained from PanVera 24938). This assay was incubated overnight at 4\u00b0 C. </p> Selected compounds of Table 2 were tested against MR, ER, PR, and AR receptors.
