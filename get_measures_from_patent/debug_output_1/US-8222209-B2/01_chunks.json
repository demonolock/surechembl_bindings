    " polypeptide has a length of 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, or 222 amino acids. In humans, the genes for pituitary (hGH-N) and placental (hGH-V) growth hormones encode 217 amino acid polypeptides. There also are additional isoforms of GH that arise, for example, from alternative splicing. There is, for example, a 214 amino acid isoform of pituitary GH. Placental and pituitary isoforms of GH, share sequence similarity throughout the protein. For example, a comparison of mature GH placental isoform (GenBank Accession No. NP<sub>\u2014</sub>002050.1) and mature GH pituitary isoform (GenBank Accession No. NP<sub>\u2014</sub>000506.2) protein sequences shows 13 amino acid differences between the mature GH protein sequences. The variants provided herein can be of any length as long as the desired activity is retained. While variants of a particular length, such as 191, are exemplified, the same variants also can be 192-222 or longer or shorter, and are provided herein.</p>2. Interaction with Growth Hormone Receptors</p>The interface between growth hormone and its receptor can be characterized using the resolution of the crystallographic structure of the GH/receptor complex and mutagenesis studies. The complex is formed of one ligand molecule (GH) and two receptor molecules. Consequently, there are two interaction sites with the receptor on the GH molecule. The apparent dissociation constant of the complex is in the range of nanomolar (Kd \u02dc0.3 nM) but the two sites do not interact with the same affinity. One site of interaction (referred to as site 1) is of high affinity, and the other site (referred to as site 2) is of low affinity. This distinction in affinity is reflected in the different interfacial surface areas (1300 \u212b<sup>2 </sup>for site 1 and 850 \u212b<sup>2 </sup>for site 2)</p>Only a few residues of GH, located at the interface, appear to be essential for the binding to the receptor. These residues are mainly hydrophobic residues. Mutation of the hydrophobic residues to alanine has no effect on the association constant (k<sub>on</sub>) of the complex hormone/receptor, but augments its dissociation constant (k<sub>off</sub>). Thus, these mutations lead to a lower affinity by accelerating the complex dissociation. These mutagenesis results indicate that the hormone binds to the receptor by a simple phenomenon of fast collision and that the role of the hydrophobic residue side chains at the binding sites is to keep the hormone bound once it has reached the receptor. Particular polar residues, charged and uncharged residues, also are important for the binding of GH to its receptor. These polar residues maintain the correct packing of hydrophobic residues of hGH and receptor at the binding sites.</p>3. Growth Hormone as a Biopharmaceutical</p>Growth hormone is administered as a therapeutic agent. For example, in humans, GH is used as a therapeutic for treatment of children and adult growth deficiency, Turner syndrome and AIDS wasting among other disorders. Treatment with GH is a well-established therapy. Subjects receiving GH are subject to very frequent repeat applications of the drug, often on a daily basis. For example, GH replacement is normally given by daily subcutaneous (s.c.) injections (see, for example Albertsson-Wikland et al. Acta. Paediatr. Scand. 75: 89-97 (1986)). The necessity of frequent and repeated applications of GH is due to its instability in the blood stream and under storage conditions.</p>Hence, improved GH stability (half-life) in serum and in vitro (e.g., during production, purification and storage conditions) would improve its utilit",
    "e 5). Twelve dilutions were made for each curve and each dilution was assayed in triplicate. Using the data from the serial dilution assays, the concentration needed to achieve 50% activity. (EC<sub>50</sub>) was obtained. Experimental points were fitted to a sigmoidal curve using Gnuplot 5.0 (software for drawing data curves; available online at gnuplot.info) integrated to the NEMO (Newly evolved Molecules) software (Nautilus Biotech) as follows. The equation used for the sigmoidal curve fitting was:\n\nSig(x)=base+p max*(xexp.nu)/Xexp.nu)+kappa\n\nwhere base, pmax, nu and kappa are parameters for each curve as follows: base=0.1, pmax=1, kappa=5000, nu=2.5 and n between 5 and 150. Gnuplot iterates fitting \u201cn\u201d times until it finds the best curve that fits the experimental data while minimizing the sum of the squares of the distance between each experimental point and the theoretical point on the fitting curve. Once the fitting curve for each mutant is obtained, the corresponding EC<sub>50 </sub>and specific activity are calculated from the curves. Exemplary curves are shown in FIG. 3.\n</p>Those on the top of the ranking list were selected as LEADs. Table 8 provides activity (EC<sub>50</sub>) and resistance to proteolysis (indicated as \u2018no change\u2019, \u2018increase\u2019 or \u2018decrease\u2019) data compared to native hGH (SEQ ID NO: 1 and the NIBSC GH standard described herein) for all candidate LEAD mutants described. EC<sub>50 </sub>calculations were based on the average of two determinations. The EC50 of the modified hGH proteins was decreased, overall, compared to wild-type hGH polypeptides.</p>TABLE 8Average of 3Average of 3determinationsdeterminationsResistance toResistance toMutationEC<sub>50</sub>proteolysisMutationEC<sub>50</sub>proteolysisF1I/P2A90.56increaseF92V97.72no changesF1I/P2S120.67no changesL93I76.97no changesF1V/P2A75.28no changesL93V96.40no changesF1V/P2S60.39no changesR94H88.74no changesP5A83.66no changesR94Q94.03no changesP5S99.51increaseF97I93.38no changesL6I92.29no changesF97V68.32no changesL6V111.32no changesL101I94.59no changesR8H85.11no changesL101V134.99increaseR8Q108.30no changesY103H83.33no changesL9I93.41no changesY103I88.96no changesL9V119.78increaseD107N87.43no changesF10I119.48no changesD107Q70.59no changesF10V100.49no changesY111H58.16no changesD11N100.47increaseY111I56.19increaseD11Q72.23no changesD112N73.94increaseM14I103.28no changesD112Q72.75no changesM14V81.47increaseL113I83.87no changesL15I76.31no changesL113V82.49no changesL15V2,701.08no changesL114I60.48no changesR16H96.75increaseL114V81.81no changesR16Q104.24no changesK115N97.38no changesR19H59.89no changesK115Q89.44no changesR19Q129.68no changesD116N75.90no changesL20I91.80no changesD116Q99.39increaseL20V105.58no changesL117I126.24no changesL23I95.68increaseL117V111.76no changesL23V95.33increaseE118Q93.67no changesF25I75.71no changesE118H101.91no changesF25V61.20no changesE118N83.61no changesD26N77.15increaseE119Q110.30increaseD26Q84.56no changesE119H79.50no changesY28H125.40"
