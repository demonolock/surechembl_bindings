    " 1983, Epidemiologic Reviews 5, p. 220-246). However, this review also reports that there is some evidence of a naturally occurring protective immune response, which apparently limits the population of mature worms in infected dogs.</p>Furthermore, it has been possible to induce protective immunity artificially. Wong, et al., 1974, Exp. Parasitol. 35, p. 465-474, reported the immunization of dogs with radiation-attenuated infective larvae. The dogs were protected to varying degrees upon challenge. Blair, et al., 1982 in Fifth International Congress of Parasitology, Toronto, Canada, reported successful immunization by infecting the dogs and terminating the infection at the fourth larval stage by chemotherapy.</p>Grieve, 1989, Proc. Heartworm Symp., p. 187-190, reviewed the status of attempts to produce vaccines against heartworm in dogs. This report summarizes the use of infective larvae implanted in an inert diffusion chamber which permits the influx of cells and/or serum from the host and outflow of parasite material from the chamber to assess the effectiveness of inoculation protocols in both dogs and mice. The use of immunization with infective larvae was demonstrated to be partially effective in protection against subsequent challenge.</p>An alternative approach to finding, for example, a heartworm vaccine has been to attempt to identify prominent antigens in the infective stage of D. immitis. Philipp, et al., 1986, J. Immunol. 136, p. 2621-2627, reports a 35-kilodalton (kD) major surface antigen of D. immitis third stage larvae which was capable of immunoprecipitation with sera from dogs carrying an occult experimental D. immitis infection or with sera from dogs immunized by irradiated third stage larvae. In addition, this group reported (Davis, et al., 1988, Abstract 404, 37th Annual Meeting, Am. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg.) three major surface proteins of the L4 having molecular weights of 150 kD, 52 kD, and 25 kD. The 25 kD molecule seemed unique to L4 larvae.</p>Ibrahim, et al., 1989, Parasitol. 99, p. 89-97, using D. immitis L3 larvae labeled with <sup>125</sup> I, showed that a 35 kD and 6 kD component were shed into the culture medium by developing parasites. They further showed that antibodies from immunized rabbits and infected dogs immunoprecipitated the 35 kD, but not the 6 kD, component.</p>Scott, et al, 1990, Acta Tropica 47, p. 339-353, reported characterization of the surface-associated molecules of D. immitis L2, L3, and L4 by radiolabeling techniques and SDS-PAGE. They found major labeled components of 35 kD and 6 kD in extracts from iodine-labeled L2 and L3; lactoperoxidase-catalyzed labeling revealed components of apparent molecular weights 66 kD, 48 kD, 25 kD, 16.5 kD, and 12 kD. Iodine labeling of surface-associated molecules of L4 gave molecules of apparent molecular weights of 57 kD, 40 kD, 25 kD, 12 kD, and 10 kD; lactoperoxidase-catalyzed labeling showed additional bands of 45 kD, 43 kD, and 3 kD. However, these antigens were identified using uncharacterized serum sources.</p>Other approaches to obtaining vaccines against parasites in general have focused on the production of neutralizing antibodies. For example, both in vitro studies by Tanner, et al., 1981, Trans. Roy. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 75, p. 173-174 and by Sim et al., 1982, Trans. Roy. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 76, p. 362-370, and in vivo studies by Parab et al., 1988, Immunol. 64, p. 169-174, have demonstrated that antibodies are effective alone or with other immune components in killing filarial L3 from Dipetalonema (Acanthocheilonema) viteae or Brugia malayi. Furthermore, passive immunity to Schistosoma mansoni has been transferred from immune rats or humans to normal mice (see, for example, Sher, et al., 1975, Parasitol. 70, p. 347-357; Jwo et al., 1989, Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 41, p. 553-562). None of these studies involved the use of an in vivo assay to determine the ability of serum, or cellular, components to be a useful screening tool for identifying protective antigens. Neither has any of these studies yet identified an effective vaccine.</p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention includes an isolated parasitic helminth nucleic acid sequence capable of hybridizing, under stringent conditions, to at least a portion of D. immitis nucleic acid sequence p4 and/or to at least a portion of D. immitis nucleic acid sequence p22U. A preferred isolated nucleic acid sequence encodes a protein capable of selec",
    "that permit selective binding by desired proteins to components in the serum. Complexes between the proteins and serum components are recovered, the proteins are separated from the serum components and are then analyzed. Nucleic acid sequence encoding such proteins can be identified using known recombinant DNA techniques, such as those described in Sambrook et al., ibid. In another embodiment, the immune serum screening assay can be used to identify nucleic acid sequences encoding isolated proteins of the present invention by screening parasite helminth expression cDNA libraries with immune sera of the present invention to identify proteins expressed by individual clones that are capable of selectively binding to the immune sera. The immune serum screening assay can also be used to identify mimetopes capable of selectively binding to immune serum, such as to anti-L3 and/or L4 larval immune serum. Mimetopes can also be designed or improved using information derived from proteins identified by the immune serum screening assay. It should be appreciated that not only serum, but also other immunogenic components of bodily fluids collected from animals immune to helminth infection, such as cells, specific antibodies, and fragments thereof, can be used in the immune serum screening assay.</p>As disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/654,226, anti-larval immune serum has been used to identify nematode proteins expressed during L3 and/or L4 that have molecular weights of 66 kD, 65 kD, 59 kD, 39 kD, 33 kD, 23/24 kD, 22/20.5 kD and 14 kD, as determined by their migration patterns when submitted to Tris-glycine SDS PAGE. Nucleic acid sequences encoding these proteins can be identified using anti-L3 and/or L4 larval immune serum to screen larval nematode cDNA expression libraries. U.S. application Ser. No. 08/003,257, referenced above, discloses 22-kD and 20.5-kD nematode proteins (sizes determined by Tris glycine SDS-PAGE), referred to herein as P22L and P20.5, and nucleic acid sequences that encode them, herein referred to as p22L and p20.5. P22L and P20.5 are the same protein except that P22L has a hydrophobic leader sequence attached to the P20.5 protein. U.S. application Ser. No. 08/003,389, referenced above, discloses 39-kD nematode proteins (sizes determined by Tris glycine SDS-PAGE), referred to herein as P39, and nucleic acid sequences that encode them, herein referred to as p39. The present application, by incorporating U.S. application Ser. Nos. 07/654,226, 08/003,257 and 08/003,389 by reference herein in their entireties, includes D. immitis P22L, D. immitis P20.5, D. immitis P39, additional parasitic helminth proteins sharing significant homology with D. immitis P22L, D. immitis P20.5, or D. immitis P39, nucleic acid sequences encoding any of these proteins, mimetopes of any of these proteins, and antibodies that selectively bind to any of these proteins, as well as uses of these proteins, mimetopes, nucleic acid sequences, and antibodies.</p>One embodiment of the present invention is an isolated parasitic helminth nucleic acid sequence that encodes an isolated protein of the present invention. As used herein, an isolated parasitic helminth nucleic acid sequence is a nucleic acid sequence that has been removed from its natural milieu. As such, \"isolated\" does not reflect the extent to which the nucleic acid sequence has been purified. An isolated nucleic acid sequence can be DNA, RNA, or derivatives of either DNA or RNA. Isolated nucleic acid sequences of the present invention include sequences that encode at least one epitope capable of selectively binding to immune sera of the present invention as well as oligonucleotides that can function in a variety of ways, including, but not lim",
    " a nucleic acid sequence is preferably capable of selectively binding to at least one component of anti-parasitic helminth immune serum, and more preferably to anti-L3 and/or L4 larval immune serum. D. immitis nucleic acid sequence p4, also referred to as D. immitis p4, is a nucleic acid sequence of about 913 nucleotides in length that has been isolated from a D. immitis L3 and/or L4 cDNA expression library using immune serum collected from a dog that was immunized by repeated chemically abbreviated infections (e.g., infect with about 200 L3, wait about 60 days, treat with ivermectin, wait about 60 days, reinfect, etc.). Sequencing of D. immitis p4 has resulted in the nucleic acid sequence disclosed in SEQ ID NO:1. It should be noted that sequencing technology is not entirely error-free and that SEQ ID NO:1, as such, represents an apparent nucleic acid sequence of D. immitis p4. The deduced translation of SEQ ID NO:1, represented in SEQ ID NO:2, suggests that D. immitis p4 comprises an open reading frame of about 303 amino acids and, as such, represents only a portion of the entire coding sequence of the gene. The nucleic acid contained in D. immitis p4, however, is sufficient to encode a protein that selectively binds with anti-D. immitis larval immune serum, as demonstrated by the manner in which the nucleic acid sequence was isolated. The deduced translation of SEQ ID NO:1 suggests that the protein encoded by D. immitis p4 has a molecular weight of about 35.5 kilodaltons (kD) and an estimated pI of 4.26.</p>The protein encoded by D. immitis p4 is further characterized by having an LDL receptor-related protein (LDLr) class A cysteine-rich motif of about 9 amino acids that is also found in several other proteins, including mammalian low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, LDL receptor-related proteins, human and mouse alpha-2-macroglobulin receptors and rat renal GP 330 glycoprotein. Each of these proteins, including D. immitis P4, share the sequence DDCGDGSDE, set forth in SEQ ID NO:5 (i.e., Aspartic Acid--Aspartic Acid cysteine--Glycine--Aspartic Acid--Glycine--Serine--Aspartic Acid--Glutamic Acid). A conserved stretch of eight of the nine amino acids is also found in the free-living (i.e., non-parasitic) nematode Caenorhabditis elegans LDL receptor-related protein and C. elegans basement membrane proteoglycan. This LDLr class A, cysteine-rich motif is likely to be conserved in proteins encoded by p4-related sequences of other helminths (i.e., nucleic acid sequences that hybridize under stringent conditions with D. immitis p4). As such, p4-related nucleic acid sequences may be identified using oligonucleotide probes that encode such LDLr class A motifs. Furthermore, the LDLr class A motif in P4-related proteins represents a target for development of therapeutic compositions to protect animals from parasitic helminth infection, as discussed below.</p>The present invention includes nucleic acid sequences from any parasitic helminth that hybridi",
    "eof are capable of protecting an animal from helminth infection when administered to the animal in an effective manner. Preferred helminths are heretofore disclosed. Particularly preferred isolated proteins include proteins encoded by Dirofilaria immitis nucleic acid sequence p4, a nucleic acid sequence including D. immitis p4, or a nucleic acid sequence comprising a fragment of D. immitis p4. As such, particularly preferred isolated proteins are those encoded by SEQ ID NO:1 or a functional equivalent thereof, a nucleic acid sequence containing at least a portion of SEQ ID NO:1 or a functional equivalent thereof, and a fragment of SEQ ID NO:1 or a functional equivalent thereof, as well as proteins that contain at least a portion of SEQ ID NO:2, assuming the accuracy of SEQ ID NO:1 and SEQ ID NO:2.</p>One embodiment of the present invention is an isolated parasitic helminth nucleic acid sequence that is capable of hybridizing, under stringent conditions, to at least a portion of D. immitis nucleic acid sequence p22U. A protein encoded by such a nucleic acid sequence is preferably capable of selectively binding to at least one component of anti-parasitic helminth immune serum, and more preferably to anti-L3 and/or L4 larval immune serum. D. immitis nucleic acid sequence p22U, also referred to as D. immitis p22U, encodes at least a substantial portion of a basic D. immitis protein, referred to as D. immitis P22U protein, that migrates at an apparent molecular weight of about 22 kD when submitted to Tris-glycine SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) PAGE (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). D. immitis P22U protein has been identified in larval ES (excretory-secretory) extracts as well as in extracts of L3, L4 and adults. D. immitis p22U is about 1016 nucleotides in length. Sequencing of D. immitis p22U has resulted in the nucleic acid sequence disclosed in SEQ ID NO:3. It should be noted that sequencing technology is not entirely error-free and that SEQ ID NO:3, as such, represents an apparent nucleic acid sequence of D. immitis p22U. The deduced translation of SEQ ID NO:3, represented in SEQ ID NO:4, suggests that D. immitis p22U includes an open reading frame of about 208 amino acids followed by a stop codon. The translation start site is as yet unknown although there are two \"in-frame\" potential start codons at about amino acid 13 and about amino acid 19 of corresponding (i.e., deduced) amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO:4. The deduced amino acid sequence suggests a protein having a molecular weight of about 22 kD and an estimated pI of about 9.6.</p>D. immitis p22U can be isolated in a number of ways including, but not limited to, screening an L3, L4, or adult expression cDNA library with appropriate immune serum or with antibodies raised against D. immitis P22U protein. Alternatively, amino acid sequence information can be derived from purified D. immitis P22U protein that can be used to design oligonucleotide probes and/or primers that can be used to screen and/or amplify sequences from an appropriate cDNA or genomic library.</p>The present invention includes nucleic acid sequences from any parasitic helminth that hybridize under stringent conditions to at least a portion of D. immitis nucleic acid sequence p22U, the minimal size of the portion being defined by the hybridization conditions. Due to the similarities between parasitic helminths, as heretofore disclosed, one can use D. immitis p22U to obtain other parasitic helminth nucleic acid sequences that are capable of hybridizing, under stringent conditions, to at least a portion of D. immitis p22U. Preferred helminths are heretofore disclosed.</p>Particularly preferred p22U-related nucleic acid sequences of the present invention include Dirofilaria immitis nucleic acid sequence p22U, nucleic acid sequences including D. immitis p22U, and nucleic acid sequence comprising fragments of D. immitis p22U (including functional equivalents of each of these nucleic acid sequences). Knowing the sequence of D. immitis p22U allows one ski",
    " per dog, each diffusion chamber containing about 20 L3 D. immitis larvae, using the method described in Grieve et al., 1988, ibid. Concomitant with chamber implantation, each dog was injected subcutaneously with about 50 L3 D. immitis larvae, and the infection was allowed to proceed beyond the anticipated prepatent period. Challenge infections were repeated on day 588, post initial immunization, both by implanting 5 diffusion chambers per dog, each chamber having about 20 L3 D. immitis larvae and by subcutaneously inoculating about 30 L3 D. immitis larvae per dog. Serum samples were collected from the immunized dogs at numerous time points throughout the study period. Serum samples were analyzed for antibodies that selectively bound to L3 and/or L4 surface antigens using an indirect fluorescent antibody assay, and for antibodies that selectively bound to L3 soluble antigens, L4 soluble antigens and/or to an excretory/secretory antigen fraction using an indirect ELISA, as described by Grieve et al., 1988, ibid. The results indicated that serum from dogs that had been immunized and challenged with D. immitis larvae had produced antibodies to both surface and soluble D. immitis larval antigens. The sera were pooled, and those obtained from larval-immunized dogs (i.e., anti-larval immune sera) were shown to inhibit larval development; see, for example, Example 2. Immune sera were also shown to selectively bind to L3 and/or L4 larval proteins having molecular weights of about 15 kD, 23/24 kD doublet, 31 kD, 33 kD, 39 kD, 42 kD, 55 kD, 59 kD, 66 kD, 70 kD, 97 kD and 207 kD by Tris-glycine SDS PAGE.</p>Example 2This Example demonstrates that serum collected from larval-immunized dogs, produced as described in Example 1, is capable of inhibiting parasite development whereas serum collected from non-immunized dogs is not.</p>One subcutaneous pocket was formed in each of about 3 to about 6 Balb/C BYJ mice that were about 10 weeks old. One diffusion chamber, containing 20 L3 D. immitis larvae, was implanted into each pocket alone with 0.5 ml of sera collected from immunized dogs or from non-immunized dogs, produced as described in Example 1. The diffusion chambers were recovered two or three weeks later. Living larvae in the chambers were counted and placed into glacial acetic acid, followed by 70% ethanol containing 5% glycerin. The ethanol was allowed to evaporate leaving the larvae in glycerin. The larvae were measured using projected images in the Macmeasure image analysis system on a Macintosh computer.</p>Three experiments, in which different serum samples were exposed to larvae in diffusion chambers, were conducted: Experiment 1 compared equal portions of sera collected from individual dogs at days 56, 77 and 117 after challenge. Experiments 2 and 3 compared serum collected from immunized dogs 117 days after initial challenge to control sera. In experiment 2, the control serum was a pool of sera collected from 12 naive dogs; in experiment 3, control serum was collected from a single naive dog. Each of the experiments also included controls",
    "fied clone including D. immitis nucleic acid sequence p4 was converted into a double stranded recombinant molecule, herein denoted as p\u03b2gal-p4, using R408 helper phage and XL1-Blue E. coli according to the in vivo excision protocol described in the Stratagene ZAP-cDNA Synthesis Kit. Double stranded plasmid DNA was prepared using an alkaline lysis protocol, such as that described in Sambrook et al., ibid. The plasmid DNA was digested with EcoRI and XhoI restriction endonucleases to release two D. immitis DNA fragments of about 580 and 320 nucleotides, the entire D. immitis p4 fragment being about 900 nucleotides in size.</p>The plasmid containing D. immitis p4 was sequenced using the Sanger dideoxy chain termination method, as described in Sambrook et al., ibid. The Promega Erase a Base method (available from Promega Corp., Madison, Wis.) was used to generate deletion clones for sequence analysis. An about 913-nucleotide consensus sequence of the entire D. immitis p4 DNA fragment was determined and is presented as SEQ ID NO:1. The entire 913 nucleotides form an open reading frame encoding an amino acid sequence of about 303 amino acids, presented in SEQ ID NO:2. The first ATG codon within this sequence spans nucleotides from about 417 through about 419. As such, SEQ ID NO:1 does not encode a full-length protein, but does encode a protein that selectively binds to at least one component of immune dog serum. The predicted size of the protein encoded by SEQ ID NO:1 is about 35.5 kD, with an estimated pI of about 4.26.</p>A homology search of the non-redundant protein sequence database was performed through the National Center for Biotechnology Information using the BLAST network. This database includes SwissProt+PIR+SPUpdate+GenPept+GPUpdate. The search was performed using SEQ ID NO:2 and showed the only significant homology shared between SEQ ID NO:2 and known sequences to be a contiguous stretch of 9 amino acids, namely DDCGDGSDE, set forth in SEQ ID NO:5, that was also found in human LDL-receptor related protein, human and mouse alpha-2-macroglobulin receptors and rat renal GP 330 glycoprotein. A conserved stretch of eight of the nine amino acids is also found in Caenorhabditis elegans LDL receptor-related protein and C. elegans basement membrane proteoglycan.</p>Example 5This example demonstrates the ability of D. immitis p4 to encode a protein that selectively binds to immune serum.</p>Recombinant molecule pET19b-p4<sub>635</sub>, containing D. immitis p4 nucleotides from about 1 through about 635 operatively linked to bacteriophage T7lac transcription control sequences and to a fusion sequence encoding a poly-histidine segment comprising 10 histidines was produced in the following manner. An about 635-nucleotide DNA fragment containing nucleotides spanning from about 1 through about 635 of SEQ ID NO:1, called P4<sub>635</sub>, was PCR amplified from a clone containing D. immitis p4 using the primers 5' CGGGATCCCGAGTTAAATAGTCG 3' (denoted SEQ ID NO:9 or 394-5'; BamHI site underlined) and 5' TGCAGGATCCTGCACCG 3' (denoted SEQ ID NO:10 or 394-3'; BamHI site underlined). The PCR product was digested with BamHI restriction endonuclease, gel purified and subcloned into expression vector pET19b (available from Novagen Inc., Madison, Wis.) that had been cleaved with BamHI. The resulting recombinant molecule pET19b-p4<sub>635</sub> was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS to form recombinant cell E. coli:pET19b-p4<sub>635</sub>. E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS includes a bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase gene under the control of lac transcription control sequences.</p>Recombinant cell E. coli:pET19b-p4<sub>635</sub> was cultured in shake flasks containing an enriched bacterial growth medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin at about 37\u00b0 C. When the cells reached an optical density at about 600 nanometers (OD<sub>600</sub>) of about 0.819, expression of D. immitis p4 was induced by addition of about 1 mM isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG). Protein production was monitored by SDS PAGE of recombinant cell lysates, followed by Coomassie blue staining, using standard techniques. Recombinant cell E. coli:pET19b-p4<sub>635</sub> produced a protein, denoted PHIS-P4<sub>635</sub>, that migrated with an apparent molecular weight of about 37 kD. Such a protein was not produced by cells transformed with the pET-19b plasmid lacking a D. immitis DNA insert.</p>Immunoblot analysis of recombinant cell E. oli:pET19b-p4<sub>635</sub> lysates indicates that the 37 kD protein is able to selectively bind to immune dog serum and, as such, is capable of binding to at least one component of a serum that is capable of inhibiting D. immitis larval development.</p>The E. coli:pET19b-p4<sub>635</sub> histidine fusion peptide was separated from soluble E. coli proteins by nickel chelation chromatography and an imidazole gradient. Immunoblot analysis of the total E. coli:pET19b-p4<sub>635</sub> lysate, column eluate and column void volume indicates that the 37 kD protein can be isolated on the nickel column and is able to selectively bind to immune dog serum, and as such, is capable of binding to at least one component of a serum that is capable of inhibiting D. immitis larval development. The column eluate was not detected by preimmune sera from the same immune dog.</p>Example 6This Example describes the isolation and sequence of D. immitis nucleic acid sequence p22U.</p>Total RNA was extracted from adult female D. immitis worms, poly A+ RNA prepared, and an adult female D. immitis cDNA library produced, using methods similar to those described in Example 4.</p>A segment of DNA for use in the identification of a nucleic acid sequence capable of encoding at least a portion of P22U was produced by PCR amplification using standard techniques, such as those described in Sambrook et al., ibid. Briefly, first strand cDNA was synthesized from adult female poly A+ RNA using Murine Leukemia Virus reverse transcriptase (available from Stratagene) and Stratagene's linker-primer from their ZAP-cDNA Synthesis Kit, namely 5' GAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAACTAGTCTCGAGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT 3', set forth in SEQ ID NO:11. A pool of two sets of degenerate primers was produced based on the partial amino acid sequence of the 60 min tryptic fragment described in Example 3. One degenerate set of primers, denoted GRF 11, includes the following sequences: 5' TGYTCNCCNGAYTGYGG 3', set forth in SEQ ID NO:12, wherein Y can be either C or T, and N can be either A, G, C or",
    "sequence which included a sequence corresponding to the amino acid sequence of the 60 min tryptic fragment. The nucleic acid sequence includes from nucleotides about 444 to about 696 of SEQ ID NO:3, described in more detail below.</p>The adult female cDNA library was screened with an antisense probe, using stringent (i.e., standard) hybridization conditions as described in Sambrook et al., ibid. The antisense probe, denoted GRF14, was based on the DNA sequence derived from the amplified segment and has the sequence 5' CTGTTTGAACCATAACATTATCAGATGG 3', set forth in SEQ ID NO:15. Plaques which hybridized to the probe were rescreened, plaque purified and clones containing D. immitis nucleic acid sequence p22U (i.e., clones that hybridized with the antisense probe and having the apparent nucleic acid sequence designated in SEQ ID NO:3) were submitted to nucleic acid sequencing as described in Example 4.</p>An about 1016-nucleotide consensus sequence of D. immitis nucleic acid sequence p22U was determined and is presented as SEQ ID NO:3. The deduced translation product is presented both with SEQ ID NO:3 and in SEQ ID NO:4. SEQ ID NO:3 apparently encodes a protein of about 208 amino acids, the sequence including a stop codon spanning nucleotides about 627 through about 629. There are two ATG codons spanning nuclectides about 39 to about 41 and spanning nucleotides about 57 to about 59. Although SEQ ID NO:3 encodes a protein of about the expected size (i.e., edicted size of about 22 kD), the actual translation nitiation site of the protein is as yet unknown.</p>Nucleic acid sequences encoding all three partially sequenced tryptic peptides are included in SEQ ID NO:3, indicating that the sequence does encode at least a portion of P22U. The portion of the 44 min tryptic fragment that was sequenced spans amino acids about 77 to about 92 of SEQ ID NO:4 and agrees with the derived sequence in all but one amino acid. The portion of the 58 min tryptic fragment that was sequenced spans amino acids about 27 to about 48 of SEQ ID NO:4 and agrees with the derived sequence in all but one amino acid. The portion of the 60 min tryptic fragment that was sequenced spans amino acids about 145 to about 166 of SEQ ID NO:4 and agrees with the derived sequence in all but one amino acid. A homology search of the non-redundant protein sequence database was performed through the National Center for Biotechnology Information using the BLAST network. This database includes SwissProt+PIR+SPUpdate+GenPept+GPUpdate. The search was performed using SEQ ID NO:4 and no significant homology with known proteins was indicated.</p>Example 7This example demonstrates the ability of D. immitis p22U to encode a protein that selectively binds to immune serum.</p>Recombinant molecule pHis-p22U<sub>608</sub>, containing D. immitis p22U nucleotides from about 41 through about 649 operatively linked to trc transcription control sequences and to a fusion sequence encoding a poly-histidine segment comprising 6 histidines was produced in the following manner. An about 608-nucleotide DNA fragment containing nucleotides spanning from about 41 through about 649 of SEQ ID NO:3, called p22U<sub>608</sub>, was PCR amplified from a clone containing D. immitis p22U using the primers 5' GTTGCAATATGGGATCCAATGAGCC 3' (denoted SEQ ID NO:16 or 22USEN; BamHI site underlined) and 5' CGCTAGTGCAGGATCCTCAATACTC 3' (denoted SEQ ID NO:17 or 22UANT; BamHI site underlined). The PCR product was digested with BamHI restriction endonuclease, gel purified and subcloned into expression vector pTrcHisB (available from Invitrogen) that had been cleaved with BamHI. The resulting recombinant molecule pHis-p22U<sub>608</sub> was transformed into E. coli to form recombinant cell E. coli:pHis-p22U<sub>608</sub>. The recombinant cell was cultured in shake flasks containing an enriched bacterial growth medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin at about 37\u00b0 C. When the cells reached an OD<sub>600</sub> of about 0.3, expression of D. immitis p22U<sub>608</sub> was induced by addition of about 1 mM IPTG. Protein production was monitored by SDS PAGE of recombinant cell lysates, followed by Coomassie blue staining, using standard techniques. Recombinant cell E. coli:pHis-p22U<sub>608</sub> produced a protein, denoted herein as PHIS-P22U<sub>608</sub>, that migrated with an apparent molecular weight of about 27 kD. Such a protein was not produced by cells transformed with the pTrcHisB plasmid lacking a D. immitis DNA insert.</p>Immunoblot analysis of recombinant cell E. coli:pHis-p22U<sub>608</sub> lysates indicates that the 22-kD protein is able to selectively bind to immune dog serum and, as such, is capable of binding to at least one component of a serum that is capable of inhibiting D. immitis larval development. Immune dog serum essentially does not bind to lysates of cells transformed with only the pTrcHisB plasmid.</p>__________________________________________________________________________\n#             SEQUENCE LISTING                                            \n  - -  - - (1) GENERAL INFORMATION:                                       \n  - -    (iii) NUMBER OF SEQUENCES: 17                                    \n  - -  - - (2) INFORMATION FOR SEQ ID NO:1:                               \n  - -      (i) SEQUENCE CHARACTERISTICS:                                  \n           (A) LENGTH: 913 base - #pairs                                  \n           (B) TYPE: nucleic acid                                         \n           (C) STRANDEDNESS: single                                       \n           (D) TOPOLOGY: linear                                           \n  - -     (ii) MOLECULE TYPE: cDNA                                        \n  - -     (ix) FEATURE:                                                   \n           (A) NAME/KEY: CDS                                              \n           (B) LOCATION: 3..911                                           \n  - -     (xi) SEQUENCE DESCRIPTION: SEQ ID NO:1:                         \n  - - GC GAG TTA AAT AGT CGA ATT TCC GGA GTA CAC - # CGT AAT ACT GCA GGT"
