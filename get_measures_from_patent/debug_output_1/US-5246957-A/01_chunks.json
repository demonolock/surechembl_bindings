    "d respiratory diseases (bronchoconstriction and asthma) and more in general is involved in atherosclerosis.</p>TxA<sub>2</sub> exerts its action in platelet and smooth muscle cells through the occupancy of receptor(s), the TxA<sub>2</sub> receptor(s). The effects of TxA<sub>2</sub> can be counteracted by an agent possessing TxA<sub>2</sub> receptors antagonistic properties and/or by an agent inhibiting the enzymes involved in the synthesis of TxA<sub>2</sub>, in particular TxA<sub>2</sub> -synthase which catalyzes the formation of TxA<sub>2</sub> from cyclic endoperoxides prostaglandin G<sub>2</sub> and prostaglandin H<sub>2</sub> without affecting the synthesis of other prostaglandins.</p>Agents which inhibit TxA<sub>2</sub> action either by antagonizing TxA<sub>2</sub> and/or inhibiting TxA<sub>2</sub> -synthase may be expected to be of therapeutic value in the treatment of the above-mentioned diseases and in other pathological conditions in which TxA<sub>2</sub> is involved.</p>The compounds of the present invention, which possess these activities, are believed to be effective in the treatment of a disease state in which an enhancement of TxA<sub>2</sub> synthesis exerts a pathogenic effect, for instance those mentioned above.</p>METHODSThe effects of a representative group of compounds of the invention were evaluated, in comparison with known compounds, on TxB<sub>2</sub> synthesis inhibition in vitro, in whole blood of normal rats, and on TxA<sub>2</sub> antagonism in a binding assay in washed human platelets.</p>TxB<sub>2</sub> Synthesis InhibitionBlood was withdrawn from the abdominal aorta of normal Sprague Dawley rats (Charles River Italy) under light ether anaestesia. The blood was immediately divided in portions of 0.5 ml and distributed in glass tubes each containing a concentration of the test compound, or of the reference compounds.</p>Samples were then allowed to clot for 1 hour at 37\u00b0 C., centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min, and serum collected and stored at -20\u00b0 C. until assayed. TxB<sub>2</sub> levels were determined by RIA according to previously described procedures (Thromb. Res. 17, 3/4, 317, 1980) using highly sensitive antibody.</p>Displacement of [<sup>3</sup> H]-SQ 29,548 Binding to Washed Human PlateletsBlood from healthy volunteers of both sexes who had not taken any medication for at least 10 days was collected into one-tenth volume of acid citrate dextrose containing indomethacin (28 \u03bcM). Platelet rich plasma (PRP), obtained by centrifugation of the blood at 200\u00d7 g for 20 min, was washed twice (1000\u00d7 g for 10 min). The platelets were then resuspended in Tyrode-Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) to a final concentration of 5-10\u00d710<sup>-8</sup> cells/ml and incubated for 0-60 min at 25\u00b0 with [<sup>3</sup> H]-SQ 29,548 (5 nM). For displacement experiments various concentrations (10<sup>-9</sup> -10<sup>-4</sup> M) of competing ligands were added and incubated for 30 min at 25\u00b0 C. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of "
