    "es phytic acid and its salts as well as other polyphosphorylated inositol compounds.</p>The amount of tooth substantive agent may range from about 0.1% to about 35% by weight of the total oral composition. In dentifrice formulations, the amount is typically from about 2% to about 30%, from about 5% to about 25%, or from about 6% to about 20%. In mouthrinse compositions, the amount of tooth substantive agent may range from about 0.1% to 5% or from about 0.5% to about 3%.</p>In addition to creating the surface modifying effects, the tooth substantive agent may also function to solubilize insoluble salts. For example, Glass H has been found to solubilize insoluble stannous salts. Thus, in compositions containing stannous fluoride for example, Glass H contributes to decreasing the stain promoting effect of stannous.</p>Chelating AgentsAnother optional agent is a chelating agent, also called sequestrants, such as gluconic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid and pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof. Chelating agents are able to complex calcium found in the cell walls of the bacteria. Chelating agents can also disrupt plaque by removing calcium from the calcium bridges which help hold this biomass intact. However, it is not desired to use a chelating agent which has an affinity for calcium that is too high, as this may result in tooth demineralization, which is contrary to the objects and intentions of the present invention. Suitable chelating agents will generally have a calcium binding constant of about 10<sup>1 </sup>to 10<sup>5 </sup>to provide improved cleaning with reduced plaque and calculus formation. Chelating agents also have the ability to complex with metallic ions and thus aid in preventing their adverse effects on the stability or appearance of products. Chelation of ions, such as iron or copper, helps retard oxidative deterioration of finished products.</p>Examples of suitable chelating agents are sodium or potassium gluconate and citrate; citric acid/alkali metal citrate combination; disodium tartrate; dipotassium tartrate; sodium potassium tartrate; sodium hydrogen tartrate; potassium hydrogen tartrate; sodium, potassium or ammonium polyphosphates and mixtures thereof. The chelating agent may be used from about 0.1% to about 2.5%, from about 0.5% to about 2.5% or from about 1.0% to about 2.5%.</p>Still other chelating agents suitable for use in the present invention are the anionic polymeric polycarboxylates. Such materials are well known in the art, being employed in the form of their free acids or partially or fully neutralized water soluble alkali metal (e.g., potassium and sodium) or ammonium salts. Examples are 1:4 to 4:1 copolymers of maleic anhydride or acid with another polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomer, such as methyl vinyl ether (methoxyethylene) having a molecular weight (M.W.) of about 30,000 to about 1,000,000. These copolymers are available for example as Gantrez AN 139 (M.W. 500,000), AN 119 (M.W. 250,000)"
