A crosslinkable acetal in the amount given in the examples, if desired together with one or more acetal(s), 440 g of acetic acid, 100 g of concentrated hydrochloric acid (37%) and sufficient demineralized water to give a total of 200 g of reaction solution are added. The mixture is stirred at 20\u00b0 C. for 20 hours. </p>[0128] Isolation can be carried out by ultrafiltration. The reaction mixture is cooled to 15\u00b0 C. and the pH is adjusted to 3.6 by means of aqueous NaOH (5%). The polymer solution is filtered through a 0.45 micron filter and purified by ultrafiltration using a 1 kD Omega membrane from Filtron. The ultrafiltration is continued to a residual sodium chloride content of 0.004%. Before the purification is completed, the solution is adjusted to pH 7 using 0.1 N sodium hydroxide solution. </p>[0129] The isolation can also be carried out by precipitation. The reaction mixture is adjusted to pH 3.6 by means of triethylamine and precipitated in acetone in a ratio of 1:10. The precipitate is separated off, dispersed twice in ethanol and once in acetone and dried. The resultant product has the same properties as that obtained above by ultrafiltration. </p>Example 2 General Method for the Preparation of Low-Acetate Products of the Reaction of PVA with Acetals or Aldehydes [0130] 300 g of PVA (Mowiol 4-88, unless stated otherwise) is introduced into a 2 liter twin-jacket reactor fitted with stirrer and thermometer, 800 g of demineralized water is added, and the mixture is warmed to 95\u00b0 C. with stirring. After one hour, all the reactants have dissolved to give a clear solution, which is cooled to 20\u00b0 C. A crosslinkable acetal in the amount given in the examples, if desired together with one or more acetal(s), 440 g of acetic acid, 100 g of concentrated hydrochloric acid (37%) and sufficient demineralized water to give a total of 2000 g of reaction solution are added. The mixture is stirred at 20\u00b0 C. for 20 hours. After 20 hours, a sample of the reaction solution is titrated with NaOH, and the degree of hydrolysis of the PVA determined. HCl is 1.034 meq/g, acetic acid is 0.265 meq/g, corresponding to a residual acetate content of 3.5 mol %. The reaction mixture is stirred at 25\u00b0 C. for a further two hours and re-titrated. HCl is 1.034 meq/g, acetic acid is 0.277 meq/g, corresponding to a residual acetate content of 2.93 mol %. </p>[0131] The isolation can also be carried out by ultrafiltration. The reaction mixture is cooled to 15\u00b0 C. and adjusted to pH 7 using aqueous NaOH (5%). The polymer solution is filtered through a 0.45 micron filter and purified by ultrafiltration using a 1 kD Omega membrane from Filtron. The ultrafiltration is continued to a residual sodium chloride content of 0.002%. </p>[0132] The isolation can also be carried out by precipitation. The reaction mixture is adjusted to pH 3.6 using triethylamine and precipitated in acetone in a ratio of 1:10. The precipitate is separated off, dispersed twice in ethanol and once in acetone and dried. The resultant product is comparable to that obtained above by ultrafiltration. </p>Examples 3a, 3b, and 3c High Acetate Macromers [0133] The preparation method of example 1 was used.
