Fifty-microliter\naliquots were transferred to a fluorescence-compatible\nplate and then read with a Perkin-Elmer\nfluorometer LS-50B (excitation 340 nm and emission\n425 nm). Calcineurin (bovine brain, Sigma) (5 \u00b5g,\n0.8 unit) was assayed with 10 mM p-nitrophenyl\nphosphate in 1 mM DTT, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, 200 \u00b5M\ncalmodulin (CaM, if added), and 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)\nat 25\u00b0C for 60 minutes or more. Production of\np-nitrophenol was monitored at 405 nm. Inhibition of\nthese proteases are presented as IC<sub>50</sub>.</p>\n  As shown in Table II, example of \u03b1-substituted\nhydrazides inhibited Calpain I and II with IC<sub>50</sub> between\n0.36 \u00b5M to 0.59 \u00b5 M but did not inhibit trypsin (a\nserine protease) or metalloprotease thermolysin.\nPapain (a cysteine protease) was inhibited at higher\nconcentrations. Therefore, these results showed that\nthe \u03b1-substituted hydrazides showed good selectivity\nfor calpain over other proteases.\nInhibitory Activity of \u03b1-Substituted Hydrazide Example 5 Against Various ProteasesProteaseIC<sub>50</sub> (\u00b5M)Calpain I0.364Calpain II0.590Cathepsin B&gt;200Papain5.6Trypsin&gt;200Thermolysin&gt;500Calmodulin-calcineurin&gt;500</p>\n  EXAMPLE 3\n  Cell-based calpain assay: Previously, it was\ndemonstrated that A23187 treatment of human leukemic\nMolt-4 cells lead to a distinct spectrin breakdown by\nendogenous calpain, namely the formation of 150 kD and \n145 kD fragments sequentially (Saido, et al., J Biol\nChem 1992;267:24585-24590). In our studies, Molt-4\ncells were washed three times with serum-free RPMI 1640\nmedium and resuspended to 4 million/0.5 mL and\ntransferred to a 12-well plate (0.5 mL/well). Calpain\ninhibitor was added to the wells if desired and\npreincubated for 1 hour. To activate endogenous\ncalpain, 15 \u00b5M of A23187 (as 5 mM DMF stock) was then\nadded, and the cells were further incubated for\n90 minutes at 37\u00b0C. The cells were then lysed with 2%\n(w/v) SDS, 5 mM EGTA, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM\nPMSF, 10 \u00b5g/mL AEBSF, 5 \u00b5g/mL leupeptin, 10 \u00b5g/mL\npepstatin, 10 \u00b5g/mL TLCK, 10 \u00b5g/mL TPCK, and 20 mM\nTris-HCl (pH 7.4) at room temperature for 5 to\n10 minutes. One hundred microliters of 100% (w/v) TCA\nwas added and total protein precipitate was collected\nby microcentrifugation. The final pellets were\nneutralized with Tris base. Protein samples (50 \u00b5g)\nwere run on SDS-PAGE with the Tris-glycine running\nbuffer system and transferred onto a PVDF membrane.\nThe blots were probed with an anti-spectrin\n(nonerythroid) antibody and a second antibody with\nalkaline phosphatase conjugate. The blots were\ndeveloped with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate.\nPretreatment of cells\nwith \u03b1-substituted hydrazides diminished the 145 kD\nfragment formation with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 15 to 25 \u00b5M\n(Table III).

Seventeen-day-old cultures were\npretreated with 200 \u00b5M calpain inhibiting compound\n(when added) for 1 hour before treatment of 500 \u00b5M\nN-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) for 30 minutes (in the\nabsence or the presence of the compound). After an\nadditional 4 hours in the absence or the presence of\nthe compound (Example 5), LDH release from neurons to\nthe medium as a measurement of NMDA-induced cell death\nwas performed similarly as described by Koh JY,\nChoi DW, J Neurosci Methods 1987;20:83-90).</p>\n  Data shown in Table IV illustrated that\n195 minutes of hypoxia/hypoglycemia induced about\n170 unit/mL LDH release from the cells. We also found\nthat Example 5 of \u03b1-substituted Hydrazides enabled the\nneurons to resist the oxygen/glucose deprivation for\nlonger, as reflected by the LDH release after 24 hours. \nEffects of the Compound of Example 5 on Oxygen/Glucose Deprivation Induced LDH Release from Fetal Rat Cerebrocortical CulturesConditionsLDH release (Unit/mL"
