The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and sodium triacetoxy borohydride (1 equivalent) added then 0.5 equivalent added after 1 hour. The reaction was stirred for a further 1 hour, then diluted with water, extracted EtOAc (x 3), washed (brine), dried (MgSO<sub>4</sub>) io concentrated in vacuo.

For the preparation of membranes, the adherent transfected HEKcells were grown to confluence in two layer tissue culture factories (Fisher, catalogue number</p>\n  30 TKT-170-070E). Maximal levels of receptor expression were induced by addition of 50OmM sodium butyrate for the last 18 hours of culture. The adherent cells were washed once with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 50ml per cell factory) and detached by the addition of 50ml per cell factory of ice-cold membrane homogenisation buffer [2OmM HEPES (pH 7.4), \n\n O.lmM dithiothreitol, ImM EDTA, O.lmM phenyl methyl sulphonyl fluoride and 100\u03bcg/ml bacitracin]. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 220xg for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C, re- suspended in half the original volume of fresh membrane homogenisation buffer and disrupted using a Polytron homogeniser for 2 x 20 second bursts keeping the tube in ice at all s times. Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 220xg for 10 minutes at 4<sup>0</sup>C and the membrane fraction pelleted by centrifugation at 90000xg for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C. The final pellet was re-suspended in 4 ml of membrane homoge",
    "ere stored at -80\u00b0C in suitable aliquots. All assays were performed in Corning clear bottomed, white 96-well NBS plates o (Fisher). Prior to assay, the HEK cells membranes containing CRTh2 were coated onto SPA PVT WGA beads (Amersham). For coating membranes were incubated with beads at typically 25 \u03bcg membrane protein per mg beads at 4\u00b0C with constant agitation overnight. (The optimum coating concentrations were determined for each batch of membranes) The beads were pelleted by centrifugation (800xg for 7minutes at 4<sup>0</sup>C), washed once with assay buffer s (5OmM HEPES pH 7.4 containing 5mM magnesium chloride) and finally re-suspended in assay buffer at a bead concentration of 10mg/ml.</p>\n  Each assay contained 20\u03bcl of 6.25nM [<sup>3</sup>H]PGD<sub>2</sub>, 20\u03bcl membrane saturated SPA beads both in assay buffer and lO\u03bcl of compound solution or 13,14-dihydro-15-keto prostaglandin D<sub>2</sub> (DK-PGD<sub>2</sub>, for determination of non-specific binding, Cayman chemical company). 0 Compounds and DK-PGD<sub>2</sub> were dissolved in DMSO and diluted in the same solvent to</p>\n  10Ox the required final concentration.
