    "ention. The side chain of any of the cystein residues can of course be used not only for conjugation of serum half-life increasing compounds but as well for conjugation \n\n of any wanted conjugation partner such as an organic molecule, an enzyme label, a toxin, a cystostatic agent, a pharmaceutically suitable radioactive label, a fluorescent label, a chromogenic label, a luminescent label, a hapten, digoxigenin, biotin, a metal complexe, a metal or colloidal gold, to name only a few evocative examples. The conjugation can be carried out using any convential coupling method known in the art (see for instance Example 18, in which the cystein residue can be activated by a reagent such as Tris[2-carboxyethyl] phosphine (TCEP) or dithiotreitol (DTT) and then further reacted with a reagent such as 3-N- maleimido-6-hydraziniumpyridine hydrochloride (HYNIC).</p>\n  The present invention also encompasses truncated muteins (i.e. fragments) as defined above, in which for example, the first four N-terminal amino acid residues of the sequence of mature human tear lipocalin (His-His-Leu-Leu; positions 1-4) and/or the last two C-terminal amino acid residues (Ser-Asp; positions 157-158) of the sequence of mature human tear lipocalin have been deleted (cf. also the Examples and the attached Sequence Listings).</p>\n  The lipocalin muteins of the invention are able to bind the desired target, i.e. c-Met receptor tyrosin kinase or a domain or fragment thereof with detectable affinity, i.e. with a dissociation constant of at least 200 nM. Presently preferred in some embodiments are lipocalin muteins, which bind the desired target with a dissociation constant for a given target of at least 100, 20, 1 nM or even less. The binding affinity of a mutein to the desired target can be measured by a multitude of methods such as fluorescence titration, competition ELISA or surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore).</p>\n  It is readily apparent to the skilled person that complex formation is dependent on many factors such as concentration of the binding partners, the presence of competitors, ionic strength of the buffer system etc. Selection and enrichment is generally performed under conditions allowing the isolation of lipocalin muteins having, in complex with the desired target (c-Met or a domain or fragment thereof), a dissociation constant of at least 200 nM. However, the washing and elution steps can be carried out under varying stringency. A selection with respect to the kinetic characteristics is possible as well. For example, the selection can be performed under conditions, which favor complex formation of the target with muteins that show a slow dissociation from the target, or in other words a low k<sub>o</sub>ff rate.</p>\n  Alternatively, selection can be perfomed under conditions, which favour fast formation of the complex between the mutein and the target, or in other words a high k<sub>on</sub> rate. As a further \n\n illustrative alternative, the screening can be performed under conditions that select for improved thermostability of the muteins (compared to either wild type tear lipocalin or a mutein that already has affinity towards a pre-selected target) or for a pH stability of the mutein.</p>\n  A tear lipocalin mutein of the invention typically exists as monomelic protein. However, it is also possible that an inventive lipocalin mutein is able to spontaneously dimerise or form higher oligomers. Although the use of lipocalin muteins that form stable monomers may be preferred for some applications, e.g. because of faster diffusion and better tissue penetration, the use of lipocalin muteins that spontaneously form stable homodimers or mu\u03catimers may be advantageous in other instances, since such multimers can provide for a (further) increased affinity and/or avidity to a given tar",
    "th the regular meaning used in the art. For example, the term \"domain\" comprise the sema domains as structurally defined by Stamos et al., The EMBO Journal, Vol. 23, pages 2325-2335, 2004 (see for example, Fig, 3a or Fig.4 of Stamos et al.), the PSI domain, the IgG-like domains, the transmembrane domain or also the tyrosine kinase domain as structurally defined by Schiering et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, Vol. 100, No. 22, panes 12654-12659, 2003). The term \"domain\" also comprises the entire extracellular portion of c-Met formed by residues Metl to Thr 932 of the full lenght receptor protein or truncated fragments formed, for example, by residues 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 to residues 920, 925, 930 or 931 of the full length receptor. As mentioned above, by use of for example, the entire extracellular domains or only some of the extracellular domains, for \n\n example, the sema domains, it is possible to generate either muteins that bind to the HGF binding site (and then possibly have an antagonist binding mode with respect to HGF) or also muteins that have a non-antagonist binding mode in relation to HGF binding.</p>\n  In this context it is also noted that the complex formation between the respective mutein and c-Met or a domain or fragment thereof is influenced by many different factors such as the concentrations of the respective binding partners, the presence of competitors, pH and the ionic strength of the buffer system used, and the experimental method used for determination of the dissociation constant K<sub>D</sub> (for example fluorescence titration, competition ELISA or surface plasmon resonance, just to name a few) or even the mathematical algorithm which is used for evaluation of the experimental data.</p>\n  Therefore, it is also clear to the skilled person that the K<sub>D</sub> values (dissociation constant of the complex formed between the respective mutein and its ligand) given here may vary within a certain experimental range, depending on the method and experimental setup that is used for determining the affinity of a particular lipocalin mutein for a given ligand. This means, there may be a slight deviation in the measured K<sub>D</sub> values or a tolerance range depending, for example, on whether the K<sub>D</sub> value was determined by surface plasmon resonance (Biacore) or by competition ELISA.</p>\n  In a specific embodiment of the invention a tear lipcalin mutein comprises with respect to the amino acid sequence of mature human tear lipocalin at least 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 or 17 amino acid substitutions with respect to the amino acid sequence of mature human tear lipocalin, which are selected from the group consisting of Arg 26 \u2192 Thr, VaI, Pro, Ser, GIy; GIu 27 \u2192 GIn<sub>5</sub> GIy, VaI, Ser; Phe 28 \u2192 Met, Asp; Pro 29 \u2192 Leu, lie, Ala, Trp; GIu 30 \u2192 Leu, GIy, Arg, Phe; Met 31 \u2192 Ser; Asn 32 \u2192 Leu, Arg, VaI, GIn; Leu 33 \u2192 Tyr<sub>3</sub> VaI, He, Thr, Phe; GIu 34 \u2192 VaI, Arg, Ala; Leu 56 \u2192 Asn; He 57 \u2192 GIn; Ser 58 \u2192 He, VaI; Asp 80 \u2192 Tyr; Lys 83 \u2192 Ala; GIu 104 \u2192 Asp; Leu 105 \u2192 Thr; His 106 \u2192 Trp; and Lys 108 \u2192 GIy.</p>\n  In one more specific embodiment, a mutein of the invention further comprising at least one amino acid substitution selected from the group consisting of Thr 37 \u2192 Ser; Met 39 \u2014 &gt; He, Leu; Asn 48 \u2192 Ser; Lys 52 \u2192 Thr, Met; Met 55 \u2192 L",
