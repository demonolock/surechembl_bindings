After this time the solution was concentrated and dissolved in methanol (2 mL). Saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (10 mL) was added and the mixture was stirred for 30 min. The resulting precipitate was then filtered to yield the title compound (20 mg, 57%). m/z (M+H)=480.11.</p>Receptor Ligand BindingThe specific ligand binding to the receptors is defined as the difference between the total binding and the non-specific binding determined in the presence of an excess of unlabelled ligand. The results are expressed as a percent of control specific binding and as a percent inhibition of control specific binding obtained in the presence of the test compounds. The IC<sub>50 </sub>value (concentration causing a half-maximal inhibition of control specific binding) and Hill coefficient (n<sub>H</sub>) are determined by non-linear regression analysis of the competition curve using Hill equation curve fitting. The inhibition constant (K<sub>i</sub>) is calculated from the Cheng Prusoff equation (K<sub>i</sub>=IC<sub>50</sub>/(1+(L/K<sub>D</sub>)) where L=concentration of radioligand ([<sup>125</sup>I][Phe<sup>13</sup>]Tyr<sup>19</sup>-MCH) in the assay, and K<sub>D</sub>=affinity of the radioligand for the receptor).</p>The compounds of the present invention typically show binding affinities of &gt;50% at 20 \u03bcM concentration. For example, examples 51, 52, 53, 82, 97 and 102 have binding affinities of &gt;70% at 10 \u03bcM concentration.</p>While the invention has been depicted and described by reference to exemplary embodiments of the invention, such a reference does not imply a limitation on the invention, and no such limitation is to be inferred. The invention is capable of considerable modification, alteration, and equivalents in form and function, as will occur to those ordinarily skilled in the pertinent arts having the benefit of this disclosure. The depicted and described embodiments of the invention are exemplary only, and are not exhaustive of the scope of the invention. Consequently, the invention is intended to be limited only by the spirit and scope of the appended claims, giving full cognizance to equivalence in all respects.</p>All references cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety, except where stated otherwise.</p>"
