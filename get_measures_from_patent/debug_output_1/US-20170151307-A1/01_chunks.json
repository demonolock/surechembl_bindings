    "effective amount of an active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. \u201cPharmacologically effective amount\u201d refers to that amount of an agent effective to produce the intended pharmacological result</p>\u201cPharmaceutically acceptable carrier\u201d refers to any of the standard pharmaceutical carriers, vehicles, buffers, and excipients, such as a phosphate buffered saline solution, 5% aqueous solution of dextrose, and emulsions, such as an oil/water or water/oil emulsion, and various types of wetting agents and/or adjuvants. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers and formulations are described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 21st Ed. 2005, Mack Publishing Co, Easton. A \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salt\u201d is a salt that can be formulated into a compound for pharmaceutical use including, e.g., metal salts (sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, etc.) and salts of ammonia or organic amines.</p>The terms \u201ctreat\u201d, \u201ctreating\u201d and \u201ctreatment\u201d refer to a method of alleviating or abrogating a biological disorder and/or at least one of its attendant symptoms. As used herein, to \u201calleviate\u201d a disease, disorder or condition means reducing the severity and/or occurrence frequency of the symptoms of the disease, disorder, or condition. Further, references herein to \u201ctreatment\u201d include references to curative, palliative and prophylactic treatment.</p>Modified Cholix Toxin PolypeptidesMature Cholix toxin (Jorgensen, R. et al., J Biol Chem 283(16):10671-10678 (2008)) as used herein is a 70.7 kD, 634 residue protein, whose sequence is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1.</p>(SEQ ID NO: 1)VEDELNIFDECRSPCSLTPEPGKPIQSKLSIPSDVVLDEGVLYYSMTIND EQNDIKDEDKGESIITIGEFATVRATRHYVNQDAPFGVIHLDITTENGTK TYSYNRKEGEFAINWLVPIGEDSPASIKISVDELDQQRNIIEVPKLYSID LDNQTLEQWKTQGNVSFSVTRPEHNIAISWPSVSYKAAQKEGSRHKRWAH WHTGLALCWLVPMDAIYNYITQQNCTLGDNWFGGSYETVAGTPKVITVKQ GIEQKPVEQRIHFSKGNAMSALAAHRVCGVPLETLARSRKPRDLTDDLSC AYQAQNIVSLFVATRILFSHLDSVFTLNLDEQEPEVAERLSDLRRINENN PGMVTQVLTVARQIYNDYVTHHPGLTPEQTSAGAQAADILSLFCPDADKS CVASNNDQANINIESRSGRSYLPENRAVITPQGVTNWTYQELEATHQALT REGYVFVGYHGTNHVAAQTIVNRIAPVPRGNNTENEEKWGGLYVATHAEV AHGYARIKEGTGEYGLPTRAERDARGVMLRVYIPRASLERFYRTNTPLEN AEEHITQVIGHSLPLRNEAFTGPESAGGEDETVIGWDMAIHAVAIPSTIP GNAYEELAIDEEAVAKEQSISTKPPYKERKDELK</p>In various embodiments, the Cholix toxin has an amino acid sequence that shares an observed homology of, e.g., at least about 75%, at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or at least about 99% with the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1.</p>An exemplary nucleic acid encoding the mature Cholix toxin is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2:</p>(SEQ ID NO: 2)ATGGTCGAAGAAGCTTTAAACATCTTTGATGAATGCCGTTCGCCATGTTC GTTGACCCCGGAACCGGGTAAGCCGATTCAATCAAAACTGTCTATCCCTA GTGATGTTGTTCTGGATGAAGGTGTTCTGTATTACTCGATGACGATTAAT GATGAGCAGAATGATATTAAGGATGAGGACAAAGGCGAGTCCATTATCAC TATTGGTGAATTTGCCACAGTACGCGCGACTAGACATTATGTTAATCAAG ATGCGCCTTTTGGTGTCATCCATTTAGATATTACGACAGAAAATGGTACA AAAACGTACTCTTATAACCGCAAAGAGGGTGAATTTGCAATCAATTGGTT AGTGCCTAT"
