    " in 50% of AD cases (Myers et al., Neurology, 46(3):673-7 (1996)), and tau and \u03b2-amyloid protein measurements in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum A\u03b2 have significant overlap between AD and non-AD levels, limiting their usefulness (Pirttila et al., J. Neurol. Sci., 127(1):90-5 (1994); Arai et al., Ann. Neurol., 38:649-652 (1995); Jensen et al., Neurosci. Lett., 186(2-3):189-91 (1995); Motter et al., Ann.

Psychiatr., 59:280-283 (1995); Vigo-Pelfrey et al., Neurology, 45(4):788-93 (1995); Iwatsubo T., Neurobiol. Aging, 19:161-163 (1998); Nitsch et al., Ann.

Other proposed markers, such as pupillary response to tropicamide (Scinto et al., Science, 266:1051-1054 (1994); and Growdon et al., Arch. Neurol., 54(7):841-4 (1997)) and serum factors such as p-97 (Kennard et al., Nat. Med., 2(11):1230-5 (1996)), have not yet been validated in repeated controlled clinical studies. The major drawbacks of most proposed AD markers are that they are usually not brain-specific molecules associated with AD pathology and that they are not reliably measurable in peripheral fluids.</p>Neural thread proteins (NTP) are a novel family of recently characterized brain proteins. NTP is a \u02dc41 kD membrane associated phosphoprotein with functions related to neuritic sprouting and cell death (de la Monte et al., J. Clin. Invest., 100:3093-3104 (1997); and de la Monte et al., Alz. Rep., 2:327-332 (1999)). There is compelling evidence linking NTP with AD. NTP mRNA is upregulated in AD brain compared to controls; NTP protein levels in brain and in CSF are higher in AD than controls; and NTP immunoreactivity is clearly found in senile plaques, in neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), in degenerating neurons, neuropil threads, and dystrophic neuritic sprouts in AD and Down syndrome brains (Ozturk et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 86:419-423 (1989); de la Monte et al., J. Clin. Invest., 86(3):1004-13 (1990); de la Monte et al., J. Neurol. Sci., 113(2):152-64 (1992); de la Monte et al., Ann. Neurol., 32(6):733-42 (1992); de la Monte et al., J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol., 55(10):1038-50 (1996), de la Monte et al., J. Neurol. Sci., 138(1-2):26-35 (1996); de la Monte et al., J. Neurol. Sci., 135(2):118-25 (1996); de la Monte et al., J. Clin. Invest., 100:3093-3104 (1997); and de la Monte et al., Alz. Rep., 2:327-332 (1999)). NTP accumulation in neurons occurs early in AD neurodegeneration (before NFT formation). NTP has also been identified Down's Syndrome brain tissue (Wands et al., International Patent Publication No. WO 90/06993; de la Monte et al., Alz. Rep., 2:327-332 (1999)). Most patients with Down's Syndrome exhibit neuropathology similar to that of AD after middle age and d",
    "e upon the existing assays for NTP, including a need to develop point-of-care assays for NTP which can be conducted in a general medical laboratory or a doctor's office. Technical advances such as methods to routinely purify native NTP from urine in a cost-effective manner or the development of easily manufactured analogs to NTP would also improve any such assays</p>There is evidence showing that NTP may play a direct role in the pathogenesis of AD, thereby making it a target for drug development for the treatment of AD. NTP is associated with neuritic sprouting; abnormal neuritic sprouting is associated with AD. Over-expression of NTP can cause cellular accumulations of phospho-tau, which in turn precedes the formation of NFT, an important neuroanatomical correlate of dementia in AD (de la Monte et al., Alz. Rep., 2:327-332 (1999)). In addition, over-expression of NTP can cause increased cell death of an apoptotic nature linked to oxidative stress (de la Monte et al., 1999). Inhibiting the expression or the biochemical action of NTP offers one promising route to an effective treatment for AD.</p>The gene and predicted protein sequence for NTP has been identified and described (de la Monte et al., J. Clin. Invest., 100:3093-3104 (1997)). Neural thread protein was first described and claimed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,948,634; 5,948,888; and 5,830,670, all for \u201cNeural Thread Protein Gene Expression and Detection of Alzheimer's Disease.\u201d</p>Other species of neural thread protein (\u02dc26 kD, \u02dc21 kD, \u02dc17 kD and \u02dc15 kD) have been identified and associated with neuroectodermal tumors, astrocytomas, and glioblastomas and with injury due to hypoxia, ischemia, or cerebral infarction (de la Monte et al., J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol., 55(10):1038-50 (1996), de la Monte et al., J. Neurol. Sci., 138(1-2):26-35 (1996); de la Monte et al., J. Neurol. Sci., 135(2):118-25 (1996); de la Monte et al., J. Clin. Invest., 100:3093-3104 (1997); and de la Monte et al., Alz. Rep., 2:327-332 (1999)).</p>There is a need in the art for improved NTP compositions, useful in therapeutics and diagnostics related to AD and Down's Syndrome, and for compositions relating to the other species of neural thread protein useful in therapeutics and diagnostics for neuroectodermal tumors, astrocytomas, glioblastomas, and other neurodegenerative disorders and for injury due to hypoxia, ischemia and cerebral infarction. The present invention satisfies these needs.</p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention is directed to a family of novel repeat sequences of NTP having the consensus sequence of \u201cH A R L I L (portion of SEQ ID NO: 2, residues 46-51)\u201d and homologs thereof. Harlil peptides encompassed by the invention include, but are not limited to, \u201cH A R L I L (portion of SEQ ID NO: 2, residues 46-51),\u201d \u201cH A R L C L (portion of SEQ ID NO: 2, residues 91-96),\u201d \u201cH H A R L C L (portion of SEQ ID NO: 2, residues 90-96),\u201d \u201cH A R L (portion of SEQ ID NO: 2, residues 91-94),\u201d \u201cM F A R L I L (portion of SEQ ID NO: 2, residues 2",
    "f 1\u00d7TBS (pH 7) and eluted in 11 mL of 0.1 M glycine (pH 2). Immediately following elution, the eluate was adjusted to pH 7 with NaOH, followed by concentration to 1 mL using an Amicon Centricon\u00ae YM-10 (Millipore, Beverly Mass.) as in Example 1.\n\nAnalysis of NTP Activity Present in the Affinity Column Eluate: Affinity assay activity was assayed using 7C Gold\u2122 Strips, which test for neuronal thread protein in urine (Nymox Pharmaceutical Corp., Maywood N.J. See e.g., Fitzpatrick et al., Alzheimer's Reports, 3(3):155-159 (2000)). All activity as assayed by the 7C Gold\u2122 strip was in the pH 2 eluate fraction.\n\nProtein Concentration The protein concentration in the eluate was 108 \u03bcg, as determined by Coomassie Blue staining (BioRad, Hercules, Calif.). This is about 3% of the starting protein concentration. Protein concentration was 145 \u03bcg, as determined by Bicinchoninic Acid Kit (Cat. # 23223, BioRad). Absorbance corrected for the buffer at 280 nm was 390, indicating 390 \u03bcg of protein. The larger protein amount obtained with absorbance measurement is likely a result of the presence of a large amount of aromatic amino acids in NTP, which can cause overestimation of protein using this measurement technique.\n\nAnalysis of the NTP Protein From the Affinity Column Eluate by Gel Electrophoresis: 1 \u03bcg of the eluate (approximately 110-145 ng) was run on a 12.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) mini-gel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden) and stained with silver. Bands were observed at about 29 kD, 33 kD, 40-45 kD, and 60 kD. The gel was sliced into bands at 20-35 kD, 35-45 kD, and 45-65 kD and placed in 100 \u03bcl of TBS, and allowed to dialyze against the TBS overnight. The band eluates were then concentrated using an Amicon Centricon\u00ae YM-10, as in Example 1, and assayed for activity using the 7C Gold\u2122 Assay.\n\n</p>NTP reactivity was observed in the 35-45 kD band, at about 41 kD. No activity was observed for the other bands. NTP has a reported molecular weight of 41 kD. Thus, the data indicate that the NTP-3 bound to the affinity column selectively bound the NTP protein present in the urine sample of the AD patient.</p>This example demonstrates the specific binding of the Harlil peptide NTP-3 to NTP, and the use of a Harlil peptide, such as NTP-3, as an affinity ligand for affinity purification of NTP.</p>Example 3The purpose of this example was to show the self-aggregation ability of a Harlil peptide. The Harlil peptide NTP-3 forms disulfide bonds (because of the cysteine residue) and dimerizes at neutral pH. Since the dimerized peptide can bind two immunoglobulins, it can cause precipitation. This property of Harlil peptides was demonstrated using rabbit immunoglobulin.</p>1 mg of the Harlil peptide NTP-3 in 1 mL of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) was added to 3.4 mg of rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, Pa.) at pH 7. The mixture was allowed to dialyze over night, and a clear white precipitate was observed the next morning. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation and the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using a Perkin Elmer spectrophotometer model Lambda 3B. The results are shown in Table 1. Precipitation of immunoglobulin is prevented at a low pH, e.g., pH of 3.5 or less 3.5.</p>TABLE 1Immunoglobulin Precipitated Using a Harlil PeptideStarting ConcentrationFinal Concentration% Protein Precipitated3.4 mg RGG* +2.7 mg39%1 mg NTP-3*rabbit IgG</p>This example demonstrates the abil"
