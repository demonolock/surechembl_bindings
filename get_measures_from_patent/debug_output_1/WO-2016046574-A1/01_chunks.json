    "p>There are many drugs used clinically today that are very good at treating specific diseases, once the drug has accumulated in the correct tissue. Therefore, the problem is with the specific targeting of drugs rather than their mechanism of action. Targeting drugs or other effectors to the desired cells is a well-established area. One of the main approaches to targeting is to use antibodies or cell-specific ligands as the targeting element of a multifunctional molecule (e.g. Hudson PJ. Expert Opin Investig Drugs 2000, 9: 1231 -42; Borsi L, et al. Blood 2003, 102: 4384-92). </p>Antibodies have naturally evolved to act as the first line of defence in the mammalian immune system. They are complex glycoproteins which have exquisite \n\n specificity and tremendous diversity. This diversity comes about from programmed gene shuffling and targeted mutagenesis, resulting in a vast number of different antibody sequences. This diversity means that antibodies can bind to practically any target molecule which is usually protein in nature. It is now possible to mimic antibody selection and production in vitro, selecting for recombinant human antibodies against virtually any desired target (Hoogenboom HR. Nature Biotechnology 2005, 23: 1 105-16). </p>Antibodies can bind with a high degree of specificity to target cells expressing the appropriate receptor. The affinity of an antibody is a measure of how well an antibody binds to the target (antigen). It is usually described by an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd). For antibodies that need to be internalised, the association rate is more important since the dissociation rate is less critical if the antibody is taken into the cell. A variety of technology exists to select and manipulate antibodies which have desired structural and binding properties (Wu AM and Senter PD, Nature Biotechnology 2005, 23: 1 137-46). </p>As with all biological molecules, the size of the antibody affects its pharmacokinetics in vivo (Deonarain, MP et al. 1997, Protein Eng. 10, 89-98; Batra SK et al. Curr Opin Biotechnol. 2002, 13: 603-8.). Larger molecules persist longer in the circulation due to slow clearance (large glycoproteins are cleared through specific uptake by the liver). For whole antibodies (molecular weight 150 KDa) which recognise a cancer cell antigen in an experimental mouse model system, 30-40% can be taken up by the tumour, but because they persist longer in the circulation, it takes 1-2 days for a tumour: blood ratio of more than one to be reached. Typical tumour: blood ratios are 5-10 by about day 3 (Boxer GM et al. Br. J. Cancer 1994, 69: 307-14.). From clinical trials of whole antibodies, the amount actually delivered to tumours is about 1 % of that seen in mouse models, but with similar tumour to organ ratios (Epenetos AA et al. Cancer Res. 1986, 46: 3183-91 ). If another molecule is attached to the antibody, then the new size and chemico- physical properties determine the altered pharmacokinetics. Additionally, properties such as n",

Adv Drug Deliv Rev. 2012, 64:1782-99; E.L Sievers, et al. J. Clin. Oncol. 2001 , 19, 3244-3254] which can lead to gastro-intestinal damage, peripheral neuropathy and immunosuppression [J.J. Lee &amp; S.M. Swain. J. Clin. Oncol. 2006, 24:1633-1642; M.A. Jordan &amp; L. Wilson, Nat. Rev. Cancer 2004, 4, 253-265]. In addition, current whole antibody-based therapies and ADCs exhibit poor diffusion properties and lower tissue perfusion properties [Teicher BA &amp; Chari RV. Clin Cancer Res. 2011 , 17:6389-97; Jain RK. Adv Drug Deliv Rev. 2012, 64:353-365; Dennis MS et al. Cancer Res. 2007, 67:254-61] which result in a lower concentration reaching the core or poorest vascularised areas of the solid tumour [Teicher BA &amp; Chari RV. Clin Cancer Res. 2011 , 17:6389-97; Dennis MS et al. Cancer Res. 2007, 67:254- 61.]. Hence, current ADCs are less effective against larger solid tumours [Teicher BA &amp; Chari RV. Clin Cancer Res. 201 1 , 17:6389-97], poorly vascularised tumours, or tumours with a dense stroma. </p>Hamblett et al. Clin Cancer Res 2004, 10: 7063-7070 investigated in detail the drug loading of monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) onto an anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody. They found that, whilst the IC50 potency measurement of the conjugate \n\n increased with the number of drug molecules coupled, the in vivo antitumour activity did not increase when increasing from 4 drugs per antibody to 8 drugs per antibody. Furthermore, the 8 drug loaded conjugates were poorly tolerated in vivo, with the number of conjugates that could be administered being halved from 4 drug loaded to 8 drug loaded. In addition, the 8 drug loaded conjugates were cleared from the body, twice as quickly as the 4 drug loaded conjugates. Hamblett identified that 4 drug loading of antibodies to be the maximum plausible in order to achieve best clinical effect (by balancing tumour activity, tolerance and clearance). This observation has been supported by many others [e.g. Chari RV et al. Angew Chem Int Ed Engl. 2014, 53, 3796-827]. </p>Furthermore, it is known from Kim et al. Mol Cancer Ther 2008, 7: 2486-2497, that antibody fragments can couple to a maximum of four drug molecules before needing to resort to alternative strategies such as use of a polymer for coupling [US 2013/0101546]. </p>WO 2014/068443 A1 , WO 2014/134457 A2, WO 2013/082254 A1 , WO 2012/104344 A1 and US 2010/0136033 A1 each describe drugs conjugated to antibody fragments. However, none of these documents suggest a way to overcome aggregation in antibody fragments, which would be necessary for high DAR ratios in a smaller protein than a whole IgG. </p>For example, WO 2014/068443 (Pfizer) describes conjugation onto lysine residues and a sp",
    " to alter the specificity or affinity of the antibody but for no other reasons. The major part of the domain sequence is the framework region. Figure 1 (modified from Knappik et al. J. Mol. Biol. 2000, 296: 57-86) indicates which residues in a human variable domain tend to be present at the surface of the antibody and which areas tend to be interior as part of the core. Given the high degree of structural and sequence homology between antibodies, these regions can generally be applied to all antibody sequences. The surface framework regions tend to contain the charged or polar residues. It is an advantage if the functional and physical properties of the therapeutic agent and the carrier molecule are qualitatively substantially unaltered in the coupled form in comparison to the properties when in an uncoupled form. </p>By qualitatively substantially unaltered we mean that the therapeutic agent retains its therapeutic function but that this may be quantitatively different when conjugated (e.g. the therapeutic function could be enhanced compared to the unconjugated drug); and that the carrier molecule binds to the same target(s) when conjugated as when unconjugated but that may be quantitatively different (e.g. binding affinity could be higher). \n\n The term \"binding affinity\" includes the meaning of the strength of binding between a carrier molecule and its target (such as, but not limited to, an antibody fragment and an antigen). The compound of the invention should possess an IC50 of &lt;100nM, preferably &lt;1 nM, more preferably &lt;10pM, and even more preferably &lt;0.1 pM. </p>It is preferable if the compound has an IC50 of up to 10-fold lower (i.e. 10-fold more potent) than the therapeutic agent when unconjugated. The IC50 may be at least 10-fold lower (which is the same as 10% of the original IC50) and preferably the potency will go up to 100% of the unconjugated IC50. Even more preferably, the potency is higher and so the percentage is preferably 200%, 500%, 1000% (i.e. 10-times more potent) or better. A drug maybe poorly potent on its own (e.g. cannot cross the cell membrane) but be very potent as an ADC (hence 1000% or better). </p>The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) is a measure of the effectiveness of a substance in inhibiting a specific biological or biochemical function. This measure indicates how much of a particular drug or other substance (inhibitor) is needed to inhibit a given biological process (or component thereof) by half. Determination of the IC50 for a given compound is a routine matter, and typically is determined by constructing a dose-response curve and examining the effect of different concentrations of antagonist on reversing agonist activity. The IC50 value is calculated by determining the concentration needed to inhibit half of the maximum biological response of the agonist. </p>The compound should possess a murine serum half-life of at least 2 hours, preferably 4 hours, alternatively 8, 16, 32, 64 or 128 hours. Serum half life may also be measured in mice, or in humans. The compound preferably has a serum half- life of up to 5 times higher than the carrier molecule when unconjugated, preferably up to 10 times higher. The compound may possess a reduced half-life in comparison to the unconjugated form. A 50% drop in half-life, e.g from 4 hrs to 2 hrs is pharmacologically acceptable if associated with other advantageous features, such as low or reduced aggregation. Aggregation would lead to rapid clearance &lt;1 hr for a scFv or similar sized fragments, reducing bioavailability and also potentially inducing harmfull immune reactions. It is preferable if the half-life of \n\n the carrier molecule is maintained as close to that of the unconjugated carrier molecule, with a small drop tolerated. An increase of half-life up to 10-fold increase is desirable (e.g. 4 hrs to 20hrs in mice). Serum half-life is the calculated duration of time for a serum level of a compound to be reduced to half its initial value. Determination of the serum half-life for a given compound is a routine matter, and typically is determined by measuring the amounts of drug in the serum over time following compound administration to an organism.

Extensive PBS washes were in between each layer and detection was with BM-Blue substrate. The plot (Figure 10) shows that, the unmodified antibody with a Kd of 25nM showed a slightly reduced affinity for HER2 at 42nM upon reduction but this was regained when the antibody was first conjugated with SPDP to introduce more thiols and then reduced, K<sub>d</sub>=24.9nM. </p>Example 31 - Bioconjugation of P5 and cemadotin derivatives onto a single- chain Fv antibody fragment bearing multiple, well-dispersed, surface lysine residues \n\n (A). ScFv (TCT)-Cemadotin </p>Cemadotin-NHS (compound 2) was conjugated to scFv (TCT) to obtain conjugates (compound 69) with various DARs. The reaction was controlled to obtain products with low, medium, and high DARs. Initially, the hydrolysis rate of the pure, isolated Cemadotin-NHS was determined in various buffer conditions. The conditions that gave a reasonable hydrolysis rate, i.e. not too fast so that the NHS would hydrolyse to the acid before it reacted with the lysines and not too slow so that the reaction would take too long to complete. Other factors that were taken into account were the stability of the antibody in the buffer/pH/organic solvent, the stability of the drug, and the concentration of the drug in the buffer. The latter is a crucial parameter: the more concentrated the drug is in the solution, the more the hydrolysis rate will decrease. Therefore, the concentration needs to be controlled to allow for an efficient rate of hydrolysis.

Summary of the MALDI analyses of the ScFv (TCT)-Cemadotin ADCs </p>Binding ELISA of scFv (TCT)-Cemadotin conjugates </p>ScFv (TCT)-Cemadotin ADCs (compound 69) were made and characterised as described above. Their binding affinity against immobilised HER2 target antigen was determined by ELISA compared to the unmodified scFv (Figure 21 ). All proteins were detected using the C-terminal T7 Tag which was not expected to be chemically modified (no lysines present). 96-well Immunosorb ELISA plates were coated with 10\u03bcg/ml HER2-Fc in PBS, followed by the test samples, anti-T7 peroxidase conjugate. Extensive PBS washes were in between each layer and detection was with BM-Blue substrate. The plot (Figure 21) shows that the ADC with 3.9 drugs (average DAR) loaded, substantially retained its binding affinity (\u039a<sub>\u03ac</sub> declines slightly from 2.5nM to 3.3nM, the ADC with 8.2 drugs loaded, substantially retained its binding affinity (Kd declines slightly from 2.5nM to 15.5nM). If the conjugation reaction is pushed further, conjugating to all but one of the surface lysine residues (1 1/12), the scFv binding is reduced but not lost (K<sub>d</sub>=27.5nM). This shows that the optimised scFv can carry a high drug load whilst retaining binding function. </p>Overall TCT-Cemadotin conclusions, biophysical data </p>The conjugation conditions were optimised as detailed above. This optimisation allowed for controlled conjugation reactions with a very high yield of low, medium and high DAR conjugates. There was no precipitation of antibody/conjugate observed in any of the conjugates, therefore recovery was very high. Following \n\n SEC HPLC purification, the resulting conjugates were concentrated to ~500\u03bcg/ml and were stable in the buffer for several weeks. Prior to using them for in vitro or in vivo testing, these conjugates were buffer exchanged into PBS and sterile filtered. Again, recovery was very high. </p>The products were analysed extensively by reducing SDS-PAGE, SEC-HPLC, AAA, MS and ELISA. </p>The techniques used for analysis are in agreement and support the argument that an optimised scFv structure, exemplified by TCT, can be loaded with multiple drugs using lysine residues on the antibody and the conjugation can be controlled to obtain monomeric conjugates (as shown by SEC-HPLC) with the desired DAR whilst retaining binding affinity. Purified conjugates with low DAR (sample 1 ) run closer to the control s",
    "ound 71). These have not been quantified for DAR but when compared to previous samples (that were quantified by AAA and MS) on SDS-PAGE, and compared to the scFv (TCT) control, it is clear that low, medium and high DARs can be formed with scFv (TCT) and Cemadotin, P5C5 and Cemadotin-C5. Trastuzumab IgG was also conjugated to P5C5 and Cemadotin-C5 with shifts observed on the gel (albeit smaller than TCT). These observations were supported by the HPLC-SEC traces where the samples gave silimar retention times for low, medium and high DAR conjugates with cemadotin, P5C5 and cemadotin-C5. (D) Binding affinity ofscFv (TCT)-P5C5 ADCs </p>ScFv (TCT)-P5C5 ADCs were made and characterised as described in examples above. The DAR was determined by AAA as before (Table 11A &amp; B), this time following the release of the di-proline fragment to identify and quantify the P5- based drug. Their binding affinity against immobilised HER2 target antigen was determined by ELISA compared to the unmodified scFv. All proteins were detected using the C-terminal T7 Tag which was not expected to be chemically modified (no lysines present). 96-well Immunosorb ELISA plates were coated with 10\u03bcg/ml HER2-Fc in PBS, followed by the test samples, anti-T7-peroxidase conjugate. Extensive PBS/tween-20 and PBS washes were in between each layer and \n\n detection was with BM-Blue substrate. The plot (Figure 30) shows that, the ADC (scFv TCT-P5C5(1)) with 8 drugs loaded, substantially retained its binding affinity (Kd declines slightly from 7nM to 13nM). If the conjugation reaction is pushed to the full limit (scFv TCT-P5C5(2)), practically conjugating to all the surface lysine residues (12), the scFv binding is significantly lost due to a critical lysine residue buried in the binding site becoming drug modified. The DARs were verified by AAA (Tables 1 1A and 11 B). This shows that the optimised scFv can carry a high drug load whilst retaining binding function. \n\n</p><img id=\"imgf000117_0001\" path=\"imgf000117_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/336679112/WO/20160331/A1/002016/04/65/74/imgf000117_0001.tif\"/></p><img id=\"imgf000118_0001\" path=\"imgf000118_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/336679181/WO/20160331/A1/002016/04/65/74/imgf000118_0001.tif\"/></p>Table 11 A &amp; B.
