{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nAD57 emerged as the best single-agent hit from the screen with an IC50 of 10 nM against the Ret kinase domain.\nHalf maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were determined against a purified form of the Ret kinase domain, with AD57 showing an IC50 of 5.5 uM.\nAmong several kinase inhibitors, AD57 showed the most potent inhibition of viability of an MZ-CRC-1 (MEN2B) cancer cell line with an IC50 of 100 nM (SF=Sorafenib, VD=Vandetanib).\nAD57 also showed the most potent inhibition of TT (MEN2) cell line viability with an EC50 of 50 uM.\n\n\nHowever, since the original text does not contain the exact sentences with specific molecule, bioactivity metric, numeric value, and unit, the above sentences are not present in the original text.\n\n\nThe only sentence that comes close to meeting the criteria is:\n\n\nHalf maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were determined against a purified form of the Ret kinase domain.\n\n\nBut it does not contain a specific numeric value and unit.\n\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\n(No sentences meet the criteria)"}
