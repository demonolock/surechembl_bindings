    "d including contacting a RET kinase, a Raf kinase, a Src kinase, and a S6K kinase with an effective amount of a compound as described herein (e.g. formula (I) to (XVIII), including embodiments thereof).</p>In a fifth aspect is provided a method of reducing the activity of AXL kinase, the method including contacting an AXL kinase with an effective amount of a compound as described herein (e.g. formula (I) to (XVIII), including embodiments thereof).</p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSFIG. 1A-1E: Screening for an optimal therapeutic index in a Drosophila MEN2B model yields a polypharmacological kinase inhibitor.</p>FIG. 1A. Suppression of Ret<sup>MEN2B</sup>-induced developmental block and whole animal toxicity were scored based on number of embryos (n) that survived as pupae (x) and adults (y). Drugs were mixed into food and fed to flies starting at larval stages.</p>FIG. 1B. Percent viability of control or drug treated flies determined for pupae (x/n) and adults (y/n). AD57 emerged as the best single-agent hit from the screen.</p>FIG. 1C. ptc&gt;dRet<sup>MEN2B </sup>adults exhibited notum defects including excessive bristles (asterisks) and scutellum defects (brackets); controls (+DMSO) died as uneclosed adults. AD57 strongly suppressed while Sorafenib (SF) weakly suppressed these defects, yielding fully eclosed adults.</p>FIG. 1D. Structure-activity relationships suggest that Ret inhibition alone is insufficient to rescue MEN2B flies. Half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were determined against a purified form of the Ret kinase domain.</p>FIG. 1E. The AD series of compounds displayed broad-spectrum kinase inhibition profiles. Clinical (*) and known kinase inhibitors are shown for comparison.</p>FIG. 2A-2D: AD57 rescues MEN2B phenotypes.</p>FIG. 2A. Among several kinase inhibitors, AD57 showed the most potent inhibition of viability of an MZ-CRC-1 (MEN2B) cancer cell line (SF=Sorafenib, VD=Vandetanib).</p>FIG. 2B. AD57 also showed the most potent inhibition of TT (MEN2) cell line viability.</p>FIG. 2C. AD57 reduced tumor progression nearly 3-fold compared to vehicle treated nude mice transplanted with TT cells. Values shown are the median of 10 animals.</p>FIG. 2D. Body weight measurements of AD57 and vehicle treated nude mice transplanted with TT cells. Values shown are the median of 10 animals.</p>FIG. 3A-3E: Multi-pathway inhibition by AD57 mitigates dRet-driven phenotypes in the fly.</p>FIG. 3A. Partial list of signaling pathways activated by oncogenic Ret<sup>MEN2B</sup>.</p>FIG. 3B. Percent in vitro kinase inhibition profiles (left) and levels of Drosophila rescue (right) are show for several inhibitors. Only AD57 significantly inhibits all three pathways. Tree indicates similarity of compounds based on hierarchical clustering of percent kinase inhibition.</p>FIG. 3C. ptc&gt;dRet<sup>MEN2B </sup>wing cells (GFP+) dived basally (arrows) and invaded into adjacent wild type tissue; phospho-Src (gray spots near top edge matching gray o",
    "reated with the indicated concentrations of drug. Following 1 hour of treatment, cells were harvested and lysates prepared for immunoblotting to detect the indicated proteins. VD=vandetanib; SF=sorafenib.</p>FIG. 21A-21C. Overcoming acquired resistance through AXL inhibitor treatment. Erlotinib plus AD57, AD80, or AD81 in ER4 cells (ER4 subline of HCC827 cells that are resistant to erlotinib treatment). Legend: diamond symbols are DMSO control, square symbols are 0.1 micromolar of compound, triangle symbols are 1 micromolar of compound, x symbol are 10 micromolar of compound, all in combination with erlotinib. AD57 and AD80 confer dose-dependent sensitivity to erlotinib in ER4 cells.</p>FIG. 22. Induction of apoptosis by combined EGFR and AXL inhibition. ER4 cells (ER4 subline of HCC827 cells that are resistant to erlotinib treatment) plated at 0.5\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>cells/condition. 24-hour drug exposure. Apoptosis measured by induction of PARP cleavage and BIM induction. E is erlotinib, AD57 at 1 micromolar, AD80 at 1 micromolar, AD81 at 10 micromolar. 24 hour exposure to AD57 or AD80 combined with erlotinib enhances apoptosis in ER4 cells.</p>FIG. 23. CellTiterGlo-based proliferation assay measuring ATP content of cells after 96 h treatment with indicated compounds. TPC1 cells were plated at 1000 cells/well in 96 well plates and grown in growth media supplemented with 10% FBS. TPC1 cells are patient-derived thyroid cancer cells expressing the RET fusion protein CCDC6-RET. The IC50-values for AD80, AD81 and AD57 are in the range of 0.1-0.5 \u03bcM. AD80 diamonds, AD81 gray squares, AD57 triangles, vandetanib black squares.</p>FIG. 24. Whole cell lysates of TPC1 cells were extracted after treatment with AD80 at indicated concentrations and given time points. TPC1 cells were grown in 6 cm dishes at 70-80% confluence in growth media supplemented with 10% FBS. AD80 treatment leads to dephosphorylation of the RET fusion protein at low nanomolar concentrations &lt;10 nM. The inhibition of RET results in dephosphorylation of downstream signaling (PI3K, MAPK).</p>FIG. 25. TPC1 cells were grown in 6 well dishes at 70-80% confluence in growth media supplemented with 10% FBS. TPC1 cells were treated with either AD80, the MEK inhibitor PD325901 or a combination of both inhibitors at indicated concentrations for 72 h. Induction of apoptosis was measured using flow cytometry based counting of AnnexinV/PI positive cells. AD80 treatment alone does not lead to induction of apoptosis but a combination of AD80 and the MEK inhibitor PD325901 leads to robust induction of apoptosis.</p>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONA.
