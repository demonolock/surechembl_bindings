More specifically, isolated nucleic acid molecules are provided which encode two splice variants of a human polypeptide named T1-R ligand III. T1-R ligand III polypeptides are also provided, as are vectors, host cells and recombinant methods for producing the same. Also provided are diagnostic methods for detecting disorders related to the immune system, and therapeutic methods for treating such disorders. </p>[0003] The invention further relates to screening methods for identifying agonists and antagonists of T1-R ligand III activity. </p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0004] Related Art </p>[0005] Interleukin-1 (IL-1). Interleukin-1 (IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2) is a \u201cmultifunctional\u201d cytokine that affects nearly every cell type, and often in concert with other cytokines or small mediator molecules (Dinarello, C. A., Blood 87:2095-2147 (Mar. 15, 1996)). There are three members of the IL-1 gene family: IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra). IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are agonists and IL-1Ra is a specific receptor antagonist. IL-1\u03b1 and \u03b2 are synthesized as precursors without leader sequences. The molecular weight of each precursor is 31 kD. Processing of IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 to \u201cmature\u201d forms of 17 kD requires specific cellular proteases. In contrast, IL-1Ra evolved with a signal peptide and is readily transported out of the cells and termed secreted IL-1Ra (sIL-1Ra). </p>[0006] IL-1 Receptor and Ligands. </p>[0007] The receptors and ligands of the IL-1 pathway have been well defined (for review, see Dinarello, C. A., FASEB J. 8:1314-1325 (1994); Sims, J. E., et al., Interleukin-1 signal transduction: Advances in Cell and Molecular Biology of Membranes and Organelles, Vol. 3, JAI Press, Inc., Greenwich, Conn. (1994), pp. 197-222). Three ligands, IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-1Ra bind three forms of the IL-1 receptor, and 80 kD type I IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1; Sims, J. E., et al., Science 241:585-589 (1988)), a 68 kD type II IL-1 receptor (IL-1RII; McMahan, C. J., et al., EMBO J. 10:2821-2832 (1991)), and a soluble form of the type II IL-1R (sIL-1RII; Colotta, F., et al., Science 261:472-475 (1993)). </p>[0008] The interactions between the IL-1 ligands and receptors play an essential role in the stimulation and regulation of the IL-1-mediated host response to injury and infection. Cells expressing IL-1RI and treated with IL-1\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 respond in several specific ways, including stimulating nuclear localization of the the rel-related transcription factor NF-\u03baB (for review, see Thanos, D. &amp; Maniatis, T., Cell 80:529-532 (1996)), activation of protein kinases of the mitogen-activated protein kinase superfamily that phosphorylate residue 669 (Thr-669) of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; Guy, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267:1846-1852 (1992); Bird, T. A., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268:22861-22870 (1991); Bird, T. A., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 269:31836-31844 (1994)), and stimulation of transcription of the IL-8 gene (Mukaida, N., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 265:21128-21133 (1990)). </p>[0009] IL-1RI-Like Family. </p>[0010] Many diverse proteins exhibit homology to the cytoplasmic domain of the IL-1RI. This expanding IL-1RI-like family includes mammalian proteins, Drosophila proteins, and a plant (tobacco) protein (Gay, N. J., &amp; Keith, F. J., Nature 351:355-356 (1991); Hashimoto, C., et al., Cell 52:269-279 (1988); Schneider, D. S., et al., Genes &amp; Dev. 120:885-899 (1994); Mitchan, J.",

As a result, there is a clear need for identification and characterization of human polypeptides which can play a role in detecting, preventing, ameliorating or correcting such disorders. </p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0024] The present invention provides isolated nucleic acid molecules comprising two highly related polynucleotides, splice variants of each other, each of which encodes a human T1-recpetor (T1-R)-like polypeptide having the complete amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:2 or SEQ ID NO:4 or the complete amino acid sequences encoded by the cDNA clones deposited as plasmid DNA as ATCC Deposit Number 97859 on Feb. 7, 1997 or ATCC 97858, also on Feb. 7, 1997. The ATCC is located at American Type Culture collection (ATCC), 12301 Park Lawn Drive, Rockville, Md. 20852, USA. The nucleotide sequence determined by sequencing the deposited T1-R-like Ligand III clone, which is shown in FIG. 1 (SEQ ID NO: 1), contains an open reading frame encoding a complete polypeptide of about 163 amino acid residues, including an N-terminal methionine at nucleotide positions 31-33, a leader sequence of about 24 amino acids, and a predicted molecular weight of about 18 kD. The nucleotide sequence determined by sequencing the deposited T1-R-like Ligand III clone, which is shown in FIG. 2 (SEQ ID NO:3), contains an open reading frame encoding a complete polypeptide of about 215 amino acid residues, including an N-terminal methionine at nucleotide positions 31-33, a leader sequence of about 24 amino acids, and a predicted molecular weight of about 24 kD. </p>[0025] Nucleic acid molecules of the invention include those encoding the complete amino acid sequence excepting the N-terminal methionine shown in SEQ ID NO:2 or SEQ ID NO:4, or the complete amino acid sequence excepting the N-terminal methionine encoded by the cDNA clone in ATCC Deposit Number 97859 or in ATCC Deposit Number ATCC 97858, which molecules also can encode additional amino acids fused to the N-terminus of the T1-R-like ligand III amino acid sequence or the T1-R-like ligand III splice variant amino acid sequence. </p>[0026] The encoded polypeptide has a predicted leader sequence of 24 amino acids underlined in FIG. 1 or FIG. 4; and the amino acid sequence of the predicted mature T1-R ligand III protein is also shown in FIG. 1, as amino acid residues 25-163 and as residues 1-139 in SEQ ID NO:2 and in FIG. 4, as amino acid residues 25-215 and as residues 1-191 in SEQ ID NO:4. </p>[0027] Thus, one aspect of the invention provides an isolated nucleic acid molecule comprising a polynucleotide comprising a nucleotide sequence selected from the group consisting of: (a) a nucleotide sequence encoding the T1-R ligand III polypeptide having the complete amino acid sequence in SEQ ID NO:2 or in SEQ ID NO:4 (i.e., positions -24 to 139 of SEQ ID NO:2 or positions -24 to 191 in SEQ ID NO:4); (b) a nucleotide sequence encoding the T1-R ligand III polypeptide having the complete amino acid sequence in SEQ ID NO:2 or in SEQ ID NO:4 excepting the N-terminal methionine (i.e",
    "[0047] By \u201cnucleotide sequence\u201d of a nucleic acid molecule or polynucleotide is intended, for a DNA molecule or polynucleotide, a sequence of deoxyribonucleotides, and for an RNA molecule or polynucleotide, the corresponding sequence of ribonucleotides (A, G, C and U), where each thymidine deoxyribonucleotide (T) in the specified deoxyribonucleotide sequence is replaced by the ribonucleotide uridine (U). </p>[0048] Using the information provided herein, such as the nucleotide sequence in FIG. 1 (SEQ ID NO:1) or FIG. 2 (SEQ ID NO:3), a nucleic acid molecule of the present invention encoding a T1-R ligand III polypeptide may be obtained using standard cloning and screening procedures, such as those for cloning cDNAs using mRNA as starting material. Illustrative of the invention, the nucleic acid molecule described in FIG. 1 (SEQ ID NO:1) or FIG. 2 (SEQ ID NO:3) was discovered in a cDNA library derived from human endometrial tumor or from human eight week old whole embryo. </p>[0049] Additional clones of the same gene were also identified in cDNA libraries constructed from human adult spleen tissue, TNF-\u03b1- and IFN-induced epithelial cells, and keratinocytes. </p>[0050] The determined nucleotide sequence of the T1-R ligand III cDNA of FIG. 1 (SEQ ID NO:1) contains an open reading frame encoding a protein of 163 amino acid residues, with an initiation codon at nucleotide positions 31-33 of the nucleotide sequence in FIG. 1 (SEQ ID NO:1), and a deduced molecular weight of about 18 kD. The determined nucleotide sequence of the T1-R ligand III cDNA of FIG. 2 (SEQ ID NO:3) contains an open reading frame encoding a protein of 215 amino acid residues, with an initiation codon at nucleotide positions 31-33 of the nucleotide sequence in FIG. 2 (SEQ ID NO:3), and a deduced molecular weight of about 24 kD. The amino acid sequence of the T1-R ligand III protein shown in SEQ ID NO:2 is about 36% identical to human mRNA for T1-R ligand (SEQ ID NO:5; FIG. 3A; Gayle, M. A., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 271:5784-5789 (1996); GenBank accession number U41804). The amino acid sequence of the T1-R ligand III protein shown in SEQ ID NO:4 is also about 36% identical to human mRNA for T1-R ligand (FIG. 3B). </p>[0051] Leader and Mature Sequences </p>[0052] The amino acid sequence of the complete T1-R ligand III protein includes a leader sequence and a mature protein, as shown in SEQ ID NO:2 or SEQ ID NO:4. More in particular, the present invention provides nucleic acid molecules encoding a mature form of the T1-R ligand III protein. Thus, according to the signal hypothesis, once export of the growing protein chain across the rough endoplasmic reticulum has been initiated, proteins secreted by mammalian cells have a signal or secretory leader sequence which is cleaved from the complete polypeptide to produce a secreted \u201cmature\u201d form of the protein. Most mammalian cells and even insect cells cleave secreted proteins with the same specificity. However, in some cases, cleavage of a secreted protein is not entirely uniform, which results in two or more mature species of the protein. Further, it has long been known that the cleavage specificity of a secreted protein is ultimately determined by the primary structure of the complete protein, that is, it is inherent in the amino acid sequence of the p"
