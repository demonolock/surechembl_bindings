    " accumulation of another Ig \n\nisotype, or transcription of another Ig isotype promoter, if the observed inhibition of the other Ig isotype in an appropriate assay is on the order of 10% or less as compared to control cells. Such specificity may be with respect to a single Ig isotype, or may be with respect to one or more Ig isotypes. For example, a CL02A3 compound may be assessed for specificity by assaying its ability to inhibit, for example, IgA production and/or accumulation or to inhibit germline \u03b1 transcription in assays similar to those described above, except that the cells are activated with effectors suitable for IgA switching and synthesis and amount of IgA produced or the amount of expression downstream of a germline \u03b1 promoter is assessed. Specific, non-limiting examples of CL02A3 compounds that specifically inhibit IL-4 induced IgE production and/or IL-4 induced germline \u03b5 transcription include peptides CL02A3wt, CL02A3LG, CL02A3TP, CL02A3EQ, CL02A3HG, CL02A3GC, CL02A3HH, CL02A3PW, and CL02A3GW.</p>As will be discussed in more detail below, it has been discovered that the ability of certain CL02A3 compounds to inhibit IL-4 induced IgE production and/or IL-4 induced germline \u03b5 transcription is mediated by binding a CLLD8 protein. Accordingly, CL02A3 compounds may also be assessed for activity based upon their ability to bind a CLLD8 protein using, for example, any of the protein binding assays described infra. Generally, active CL02A3 compounds are those having a binding constant (Kd) on the order of 10 mM or less, with Kds in the range of 100 \u03bcM, 10 \u03bcM, 1 \u03bcM, 100 nM, 10 nM, 1 nM or even lower, being preferred. Alternatively, active CL02A3 compounds are those that compete for binding a CLLD8 protein with another active CL02A3 compound. In a specific embodiment, the CL02A3 compound competes for binding a CLLD8 protein with peptides CL02A3wt, CL02A3LG, CL02A3LG, CL02A3TP, CL02A3EQ, CL02A3HG, CL02A3GC, CL02A3HH, CL02A3PW, or CL02A3GW. The ability of a CL02A3 compound to compete for binding a CLLD8 protein with another CL02A3 compound may be assessed using conventional competitive binding assay techniques. Generally, active CL02A3 compounds are those that exhibit an IC<sub>50</sub> in the range of 1 mM or lower, with IC<sub>50</sub>s in the range of 100 \u03bcM, 10 \u03bcM, 1 \u03bcM, 100 nM, 10 nM, 1 nM or even lower, in such competitive binding assays being preferred.</p>Chemical Synthesis of the CL02A3 Compounds \n\n CL02A3 compounds of the invention may be prepared using standard techniques of organic synthesis. CL02A3 compounds that are peptides may be prepared using conventional step-wise solution or solid phase synthesis (see, e.g., Chemical Approaches to the Synthesis of Peptides and Proteins, Williams et al, Eds., 1997, CRC Press, Boca Raton Fla., and references cited therein; FMOC Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis: A Practical Approach, Chan &amp; White, Eds., 2000, LRL Press, Oxford, England, and references cited therein).</p>Alternatively, CL02A3 compounds, may be prepared by way of segment condensation, as described, for example, in Liu et al, 1996, Tetrahedron Lett. 37(7):933-936; Baca et \u03b1/., 1995, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 117:1881-1887; Tam et al, 1995, Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 45:209-216; Schnolzer and Kent, 1992, Science 256:221-225; Liu and Tam, 1994, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 116(10):4149-4153; Liu and Tam, 1994, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:6584-6588; Yamashiro and Li, 1988, Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 31 :322-334. The condensation technique is particularly useful for synthesizing CL02A3 compounds comprising Gly residues. Other methods useful for synthesizing t",

Methods for synthesizing and screening such solution-phase libraries are well-known and are described, for example, in Bunin, 1998, The Combinatorial Index, Academinc Press, England (see, e.g., Chapter 6); WO 95/02566; U.S. Patent No. 5,962,736; U.S. Patent No. 5,766,481; U.S. Patent No. 5,736,412 and U.S. Patent No. 5,712,171, and the references cited therein; the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Additional review articles, references, patents and books describing myriad techniques for synthesizing and screening libraries of compounds for the ability to bind another compound such as a CLLD8 protein can be found at Lebl &amp; Leblova: Dynamic Database of References in Molecular Diversity, Internet http://www.5z.com (see especially the diversity information pages at http://www.5z.com divinfo).</p>Once a candidate compound that binds the CLLD8 protein has been identified, further assays may be carried out to characterize the binding characteristics of the compound, for example, to determine its binding affinity, dissociation constant (Kd), on- and/or off-rates, etc., using well-known techniques. For example, binding affinities can be determined using saturation kinetics and Scatchard analysis. For saturation kinetics, the binding assay can be performed with increasing concentrations of the candidate compound, which is typically labeled with, for example, a radiolabel.</p>Competitive binding experiments with an active CL02A3 or other active compound, \n\nfor example peptide CL02A3wt, peptide CL02A3GW or peptide CL02A3LG, can be carried out with increasing concentrations of unlabeled candidate compound and a fixed concentration of labeled (for example radiolabled) active CL02A3 or other compound. An alternative method for characterizing receptor/ligand binding characteristics of a plurality of compounds in parallel that may be adapted for use in connection with the invention is described in U.S. Patent No. 5,324,633.</p>In one embodiment of the invention, the candidate compounds identified will have a dissociation constant (Kd) for CLLD8 protein on the order of 1 mM, 100 \u03bcM, 10 \u03bcM, 1 \u03bcM, 100 nM, 10 nM, 1 nM or even lower. In another embodiment of the invention, the candidate compounds identified will exhibit an IC<sub>5</sub> in a competitive binding assay with an active CL02A3 compound of the invention or another compound that competes for binding a CLLD8 protein with an active CL02A3 compound of the invention on the order of 1 mM, 100 \u03bcM, 10 \u03bcM, 1 \u03bcM, 100 nM, 10 nM, 1 nM or even lower. In this context, the IC<sub>50</sub> represents the concentration of candidate compound that displaces 50% of the bound CL02A3 or other compound. Suitable assays for measuring such IC<sub>50</sub>S are well-known.</p>If desired, the ability of identified candidate compounds to modulate or regulate IL-4 induced IgE production and/or processes associated therewith can be confirmed in in vitro assays, such as those previously described in connection with the CL02A3 compounds.</p>Knowledge of the interaction surface between a CL02A3 compound of the invention such as peptide CL02A3wt, peptide CL02A3GW and/or peptide CL02A3LG and a CLLD8 protein, and in particular the CLLD8 protein amino acids involved in binding the CL02A3 compound, can also provide useful information for identifying compounds that bind a CLLD8 protein. Identification and screening of CLLD8 protein binding compounds is further facilitated by determining structural features of a CLLD8 protein-CL02A3 compound complex, e.g., using X-ray crystallography, neutron diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry or any other techniques for structure determination. These techniques provide for the rational design or in silico identification of compounds that bind a CLLD8 ",

For example, an active compound may be administered to a healthy individual who is repeatedly exposed to an allergen known to induce allergies, such as latex allergy, in an effort to prevent the individual from developing an allergy. The amount of active compound(s) administered will depend upon a variety of factors, including, for example, the particular indication being treated, the mode of administration, whether the desired benefit is prophylactic or therapeutic, the severity of the indication being treated and the age and weight of the patient, the bioavailability of the particular active compound, etc. Determination of an effective dosage is well within the capabilities of those skilled in the art.</p>Initial dosages may be estimated initially from in vitro assays. For example, an initial dosage for use in animals may be formulated to achieve a circulating blood or serum concentration of active compound that inhibits about 25% or more of IL-4 induced IgE production, or a process associated therewith, such as germline \u03b5 transcription, as measured in an in vitro assay. Alternatively, an initial dosage for use in animals may be formulated to achieve a circulating blood or serum concentration of active compound that is equal to or greater than the IC<sub>50</sub> as measured in a CLLD8 protein competitive binding assay with an active CL02A3 compound of the invention, such as peptide CL02A3wt, peptide CL02A3LG or peptide CL02A3GW. Calculating dosages to achieve such circulating blood or serum concentrations taking into account the bioavailability of the particular active compound is well within the capabilities of skilled artisans. For guidance, the reader is refeoed to Fingl &amp; Woodbury, \"General Principles,\" In: The Pharmaceutical Basis of Therapeutics, Chapter 1, pp. 1-46, 1975, and the references cited therein. Initial dosages can also be estimated from in vivo data, such as animal models.</p>Animals models useful for testing the efficacy of compounds to treat or prevent diseases characterized by, caused by or associated with IgE production and/or accumulation are well-known in the art.
