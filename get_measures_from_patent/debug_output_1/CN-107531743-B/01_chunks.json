Detection reagent: homogeneous proximity luminescence amplification (alphascreen) assay kit (PerkinElmer)</p>The experimental method comprises the following steps:</p>1. compound dilution: test compounds were prepared as 40 \u03bc L DMSO solutions, followed by 3-fold dilution of the compounds to 10 concentration points. The reference compound was prepared as a 400 \u03bc M DMSO solution, followed by 1.5-fold dilution to 10 concentration points. The diluted DMSO solution was added to the microwells of 384-well plates at a volume of 150nL per well.</p>2. glutathione-S-transferase-labeled FXR human protein and biotin-labeled steroid receptor co-activator are prepared into mixed solutions with the concentrations of 0.4nM and 30nM respectively. Add to the microwells of a 384 well plate in a volume of 15. mu.L per well. Incubate at room temperature for 1 hour.</p>4. The receptor bead mixture in the homogeneous proximity luminescence amplification assay (alphascreen) assay kit was diluted 125-fold and added to the microwells of a 384-well plate at a volume of 7.5ul per well. The experimental process was carried out in the dark. Incubate at room temperature for 1 hour.</p>5. The donor pellet mix in the homogeneous proximity luminescence amplification (alphascreen) assay kit was diluted 125-fold and added to the wells of a 384-well plate at a volume of 7.5ul per well. The experimental process was carried out in the dark. Incubate at room temperature for 1 hour.</p>EC50 test: and (3) reading the absorption signals at 520-620nm by adopting Envision to excite at 680 nm.</p>7. Analyzing data: data were analyzed using Prism 5.0 and EC50 values for compound activation were calculated. The percent activation potency (Efficacy) of a compound is then determined by the ratio of the highest signal value for the compound to the highest signal value for the reference compound.</p>FXR cell assay</p>Purpose of the experiment:</p>the effect of the compounds on the functional activity of the cells was examined by \u03b2 -lactamase reporter gene technology.</p>Experimental materials:</p>1. cell line: FXR HEK 293T DA</p>2. Cell culture medium: DMEM Medium supplemented with 10% serum and Penicilin/Streptomyces (1X)</p>3. Detection reagent:reporter gene detection kit (Invitrogen)</p>The experimental method comprises the following steps:</p>1. compound dilution: test compounds were prepared as 100 \u03bc M DMSO solutions, followed by 3-fold dilution of the compounds to 10 concentration points. The reference compound was prepared as a 100 \u03bc M DMSO solution, which was then diluted 1.3-fold to 10 concentration points. The diluted DMSO solution was added to the microwells of the 384-well plate in a volume of 200 \u03bc L per well.</p>2. Cell inoculation: resuscitating FXR HEK 293T DA cells, resuspending with culture medium, and diluting to density of 5 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup>one/mL, at a volume of 40. mu.L per well, was added to the microwells of a 384-well plate.</p>3. The 384 micro-porous plate is heated at 37 \u2103 and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>Incubated under conditions for 16 hours.</p>4. mu.L of 1mM LiveBLAzer<sup>TM</sup>The FRET B/G (CCF4-AM) substrate was mixed with 60. mu.L of the B solution and 934. mu.L of the C solution and added to the microwells of a 384-well plate in a volume of 8. mu.L per well.</p>5. The 384 microwell plates were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature in the dark.</p>EC50 test: the absorption signals at 460 and 530nm were read using Envision excitation at a wavelength of 409 nm.</p>7. Analyzing data: data were analyzed using Prism 5.0 and EC50 values for compound activation were calculated. The percent activation potency (Efficacy) of the compound was then determined by the ratio of the highest signal value for the test compound to the highest signal value for the reference compound (chenodeoxycholic acid).</p>TABLE 1 test results of biochemical and cellular experiments<sub>50</sub>\uff1a</p></p></p></p></p>Experimental example 2: in vivo studies</p>Mouse drug administration alone:</p>12C 57BL/6J male mice were randomly divided into two groups, 6 per group. The first group is a vein group which is injected and administrated by 2mg/kg for tail vein, (the solvent is 10% HPbCD water solution, and when the solubility of the medicine is not ideal, the cosolvent is added); the second group is oral group, and the administration is performed by intragastric administration of 10mg/kg and 10mL/kg (the solvent is 0.5% HPMC aqueous solution). Plasma (K) was collected at 0.083, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours post intravenous group administration<sub>2</sub>-EDTA is anticoagulant) sample; plasma samples were collected at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours after oral group administration. Blood samples were taken from 6 animals per group at 3 time points, 3 animals from batch 1 were interleaved with 3 animals from batch 2. Plasma sample analysis was performed using LC-MS/MS. Plasma concentrations were plotted against time and PK parameters were calculated using Phoenix WinNonlin 6.3.</p>TABLE 2</p></p><sup>a</sup>h\uff0cL/kg"
