Mammalian subjects include humans, non-human primates, rodents (e.g., rats, mice), lagomorphs (e.g., rabbits), ungulates (e.g., cows, sheep, pigs, horses, goats, etc.), and the like. In some embodiments, the subject is a human. In some embodiments, the subject is a non-human primate, such as a cynomolgus monkey. In some embodiments, the subject is a companion animal (e.g., cat, dog).</p>All publications, patents, and patent applications mentioned in this specification are herein incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each individual publication, patent, or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.</p>Antibodies to</p>As used herein, the term \"antibody\" refers to an intact antibody or binding fragment thereof that specifically binds to a target antigen. Binding fragments are produced by recombinant DNA techniques, or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact antibodies. Binding fragments include Fab, fab ', F (ab') 2, fv and single chain variable fragment (scFv) antibodies. An antibody is considered to substantially inhibit adhesion of a receptor to a counter-receptor when an excess of antibody reduces the amount of receptor bound to the counter-receptor by at least about 20%, 40%, 60% or 80%, more typically greater than about 85% (as measured in an in vitro competitive binding assay). The term \"antibody\" is used in its broadest sense and specifically includes monoclonal antibodies (including full length antibodies or other bivalent Fc region containing antibodies, such as bivalent scFv Fc fusion antibodies), polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies), and antibody fragments (e.g., fab ', F (ab') 2, fv, scFv) so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity. Antibodies (abs) and immunoglobulins (igs) are glycoproteins having the same structural features. The present invention includes fully recombinant monoclonal antibodies (and binding fragments thereof), in other words, wherein Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs) are genetically spliced into a human antibody backbone, which is commonly referred to as antibody surface modification. Thus, in certain aspects, monoclonal antibodies are fully synthetic antibodies. In certain embodiments, monoclonal antibodies (and binding fragments thereof) may be prepared in bacterial, fungal, mammalian, insect or plant cells.</p>As used herein, the term \"antibody fragment\" refers to a portion of a full length antibody, typically an antigen binding or variable region, and includes Fab, fab ', F (ab') 2, fv, and scFv fragments. Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen binding fragments, called Fab fragments, each with a single antigen binding site, and also produces a residual \"Fc\" fragment, named for its ability to crystallize readily.

In some embodiments, the dose is administered once as a bolus, but in another embodiment, may be administered periodically until a therapeutic result is achieved. Generally, the dosage is sufficient to treat or ameliorate symptoms or signs of the disease without unacceptable toxicity to the subject. Systemic or local administration may be utilized.</p>In another method, an additional agent is administered. In one example, the administration is sequential. In other examples, the additional agent is administered concurrently with the antibody(s) or portion(s) thereof.</p>The invention is further described in the following examples, which do not limit the scope of the invention as set forth in the claims.</p>Provided herein are antibodies that bind CCR 8. These antibodies are referred to herein as anti-CCR 8 antibodies. Many discovery strategies have been employed to obtain exemplary antibodies of the present disclosure, as discussed further below.</p>In some embodiments, MEM nanoparticles are used with full length anti-CCR 8 to immunize a subject to produce antibodies specific for MEM epitopes. Monoclonal hybridomas are then prepared to produce epitope-specific anti-CCR 8 antibodies. In other embodiments, mouse serum is collected and used to generate scFv libraries in vitro. Phage panning was then performed against full length anti-CCR 8 and MEM nanoparticles to isolate epitope specific clones.</p>In some embodiments, the half maximal effective concentration (EC <sub>50</sub>) of the anti-CCR 8 antibody to CCR8 is about 1.6, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0, 2.2, 2.3, 2.6, or 2.7 nM.</p>One skilled in the art will recognize that binding specificity can be determined by a series of competing binding paradigms in which the desired antibody demonstrates its ability to prevent binding of a known reference antibody to its target epitope at different concentrations. In some embodiments, the reference anti-CCR 8 antibody is GS-1811.</p>In some embodiments, the anti-CCR 8 antibody is a full length antibody (meaning an antibody having two heavy and two light chains linked to an Fc domain, in a \"Y\" shape). In some embodiments, the Fc domain (or simply Fc) is a human Fc domain. In some embodiments, the Fc domain of an anti-CCR 8 antibody is from human IgG1, human IgG2, human IgG3, or human IgG4.</p>Exemplary anti-CCR 8 antibody-CDR sequences</p>Provided herein are sequences of exemplary anti-CCR 8 antibodies of the disclosure. Including Complementarity Determining Region (CDR) sequences and variable heavy and light chain domain sequences (VH, VL) that constitute the anti-CCR 8 antigen binding domains of the present disclosure. The discovery of these antibodies is described in detail in the examples section.</p>As mentioned below, the light chain Variable (VL) domain CDR1 region is referred to as CDR-L1, the VL CDR2 region is referred to as CDR-L2, the VL CDR3 region is referred to as CDR-L3, the heavy chain Variable (VH) d",
    " or FUT8 CHO were harvested via centrifugation at 4000 Xg at 20min and then filtered using a 0.2 \u03bcm disposable PES filter unit (FISHER SCIENTIFIC, cat#FB 12566504). anti-CCR 8 antibodies were recovered from the filtrate using protein A purification (HiTrap MabSelect SuRe; cytiva, cat#GE 11-0034-93). WT CHO is used to express antibodies with standard glycosylation, and FUT8 CHO is used to express non-fucosylated antibodies with enhanced effector functions (denoted by \"-afuc\").</p>Antibody humanization was achieved via a variety of methods. In some cases, CDRs are grafted directly onto human germline using publicly available tools (DOI: 10.1080/19420862.2021.2020203). To potentially improve expression and performance, a single amino acid was reverted to the parental mouse sequence. In other cases, two or more amino acids are reverted to the parent mouse sequence. In all cases, the CDRs remained unchanged. The humanized variants are then tested and compared to the parental chimeras for efficacy.</p>Thermal stability antibodies were prepared in PBS (pH 7.4) at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. 10 microliters of each sample was loaded via pipette into the appropriate capillary (Nanotemper, cat#pr-C002). The capillary tube was loaded into Nanotemper Prometheus Panta instrument and the protocol was defined. The thermal expansion is carried out at a rate of 1\u2103per minute from 25 to 95 \u2103.
