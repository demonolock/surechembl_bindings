    "r there are described nucleic acid sequences and vectors containing that encode the variable heavy and light chain polypeptides in SEQ ID NO:657 and 709 and especially the nucleic acid sequences contained in SEQ ID encoding SEQ ID NO:657 and 709 contained in SEQ ID NO: 700 and 723.</p>Anti-IL-6 ActivityAs stated previously, IL-6 is a member of a family of cytokines that promote cellular responses through a receptor complex consisting of at least one subunit of the signal-transducing glycoprotein gp130 and the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R). The IL-6R may also be present in a soluble form (sIL-6R). IL-6 binds to IL-6R, which then dimerizes the signal-transducing receptor gp130.</p>It is believed that the anti-IL-6 antibodies used in the invention are useful by exhibiting anti-IL-6 activity. The anti-IL-6 antibodies used in the inventionmay exhibit anti-IL-6 activity by binding to IL-6 which may be soluble IL-6 or cell surface expressed IL-6 and/or may prevent or inhibit the binding of IL-6 to IL-6R and/or activation (dimerization) of the gp130 signal-transducing glycoprotein and the formation of IL-6/IL-6R/gp130 multimers and the biological effects of any of the foregoing.</p>The anti-IL-6 activity of the anti-IL-6 antibody used in the present invention may also be described by its strength of binding or its affinity for IL-6. This also may affect the therapeutic properties. In one embodiment of the invention, the anti-IL-6 antibodies used in the present invention, bind to IL-6 with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of less than or equal to 5x10<sup>-7</sup>, 10<sup>-7</sup>, 5x10<sup>-8</sup>, 10<sup>-8</sup>, 5x10<sup>-9</sup>, 10<sup>-9</sup>, 5x10<sup>-10</sup>, 10<sup>-10</sup>, 5x10<sup>-11</sup>, 10<sup>-11</sup>, 5x10<sup>-12</sup>, 10<sup>-12</sup>, 5x10<sup>-13</sup>, 10<sup>-13</sup>, 5x10<sup>-14</sup>, 10<sup>-14</sup>, 5x10<sup>-15</sup> or 10<sup>-15</sup>. Preferably, the anti-IL-6 antibodies bind IL-6 with a dissociation constant of less than or equal to 5x10<sup>-10</sup>.</p>The anti-IL-6 activity of the anti-IL-6 antibodies bind to IL-6 with an off-rate of less than or equal to 10<sup>-4</sup> S<sup>-1</sup>, 5x10<sup>-5</sup> S<sup>-1</sup>, 10<sup>-5</sup> S<sup>-1</sup>, 5x10<sup>-6</sup> S<sup>-1</sup>, 10<sup>-6</sup> S<sup>-1</sup>, 5x10<sup>-7</sup> S<sup>-1</sup>, or 10<sup>-7</sup> S<sup>-1</sup>.</p>B-cell Screening and IsolationThere are described methods of isolating a clonal population of antigen-specific B cells that may be used for isolating at least one antigen-specific cell. As described and exemplified infra, these methods contain a series of culture and selection steps that can be used separately, in combination, sequentially, repetitively, or periodically. These methods may be used for isolating at least one antigen-specific cell, which can be used to produce a monoclonal antibody, which is specific to a desired antigen, or a nucleic acid sequence corresponding to such an antibody.</p>There is described a method comprising the steps of:\na. preparing a cell population comprising at least one antigen-specific B cell;b. enriching the cell population, e.g., by chromatography, to form an enriched cell population comprising at least one antigen-specific B cell;c. isolating a single B cell from the enriched B cell population; andd. determining whether the single B cell produces an antibody specific to the antigen.</p>There is described an improvement to a method o",
    "cribed antibody selection methods, an antibody may be selected after an enrichment step and a culture step that results in a clonal population of antigen-specific B cells. The methods can further comprise a step of sequencing a selected antibody or portions thereof from one or more isolated, antigen-specific cells. Any method known in the art for sequencing can be employed and can include sequencing the heavy chain, light chain, variable region(s), and/or complementarity determining region(s) (CDR).</p>In addition to the enrichment step, the method for antibody selection can also include one or more steps of screening a cell population for antigen recognition and/or antibody functionality. For example, the desired antibodies may have specific structural features, such as binding to a particular epitope or mimicry of a particular structure; antagonist or agonist activity; or neutralizing activity, e.g., inhibiting binding between the antigen and a ligand. The antibody functionality screen may be ligand-dependent. Screening for antibody functionality includes, but is not limited to, an in vitro protein-protein interaction assay that recreates the natural interaction of the antigen ligand with recombinant receptor protein; and a cell-based response that is ligand dependent and easily monitored (e.g., proliferation response). The method for antibody selection may include a step of screening the cell population for antibody functionality by measuring the inhibitory concentration (IC50).At least one of the isolated, antigen-specific cells may produce an antibody having an IC50 of less than about 100, 50, 30, 25, 10 \u00b5g/mL, or increments therein.</p>In addition to the enrichment step, the method for antibody selection can also include one or more steps of screening a cell population for antibody binding strength. Antibody binding strength can be measured by any method known in the art (e.g., Biacore\u2122). At least one of the isolated, antigen-specific cells may produce an antibody having a high antigen affinity, e.g., a dissociation constant (Kd) of less than about 5x10<sup>-10</sup> M-1, preferably about 1x10<sup>-13</sup> to 5x10<sup>-10</sup>, 1x10<sup>-12</sup> to 1x10<sup>-10</sup>, 1x10<sup>-12</sup> to 7.5x10<sup>-11</sup>, 1x10<sup>-11</sup> to 2x10<sup>-11</sup>, about 1.5x10<sup>-11</sup> or less, or increments therein. Such antibodies are said to be affinity mature. The affinity of the antibodies may be comparable to or higher than the affinity of any one of Panorex\u00ae (edrecolomab), Rituxan\u00ae (rituximab), Herceptin\u00ae (traztuzumab), Mylotarg\u00ae (gentuzumab), Campath\u00ae (alemtuzumab), Zevalin\u2122 (ibritumomab), Erbitux\u2122 (cetuximab), Avastin\u2122 (bevicizumab), Raptiva\u2122 (efalizumab), Remicade\u00ae (infliximab), Humira\u2122 (adalimumab), and Xolair\u2122 (omalizumab). The affinity of an antibody can also be increased by known affinity maturation techniques. At least one cell population may be screened for at least one of, preferably both, antibody functionality and antibody binding strength.</p>In addition to the enrichment step, the method for antibody selection can also include one or more steps of screening a cell population for antibody sequence homology, especially human homology. At least one of the isolated, antigen-specific cells may produce an antibody that has a homology to a human antibody of about 50% to about 100%, or increments therein, or greater than about 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95% homologous. The antibodies can be humanized to increase the homology to a human sequence by techniques known in the art such as CDR ",
    " Amplicons from each well are analyzed for recovery and size integrity. The resulting fragments are then digested with AluI to fingerprint the sequence clonality. Identical sequences display a common fragmentation pattern in their electrophoretic analysis. Significantly, this common fragmentation pattern which proves cell clonality is generally observed even in the wells originally plated up to 1000 cells/well. The original heavy and light chain amplicon fragments are then restriction enzyme digested with HindIII and XhoI or HindIII and BsiWI to prepare the respective pieces of DNA for cloning. The resulting digestions are then ligated into an expression vector and transformed into bacteria for plasmid propagation and production. Colonies are selected for sequence characterization.</p>Example 6 Recombinant Production of Monoclonal Antibody of Desired Antigen Specificity and/or Functional PropertiesCorrect full-length antibody sequences for each well containing a single monoclonal antibody is established and miniprep DNA is prepared using Qiagen solid-phase methodology. This DNA is then used to transfect mammalian cells to produce recombinant full-length antibody. Crude antibody product is tested for antigen recognition and functional properties to confirm the original characteristics are found in the recombinant antibody protein. Where appropriate, large-scale transient mammalian transfections are completed, and antibody is purified through Protein A affinity chromatography. Kd is assessed using standard methods (e.g., Biacore\u2122) as well as IC50 in a potency assay.</p>Example 7 Preparation of Antibodies that Bind Human IL-6By using the antibody selection protocol described herein, one can generate an extensive panel of antibodies. The antibodies have high affinity towards IL-6 (single to double digit pM Kd) and demonstrate potent antagonism of IL-6 in multiple cell-based screening systems (T1165 and HepG2). Furthermore, the collection of antibodies displays distinct modes of antagonism toward IL-6-driven processes.</p>Immunization StrategyRabbits were immunized with huIL-6 (R&amp;R). Immunization consisted of a first subcutaneous (sc) injection of 100 \u00b5g in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) (Sigma) followed by two boosts, two weeks apart, of 50 \u00b5g each in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) (Sigma). Animals were bled on day 55, and serum titers were determined by ELISA (antigen recognition) and by non-radioactive proliferation assay (Promega) using the T1165 cell line.</p>Antibody Selection Titer AssessmentAntigen recognition was determined by coating Immulon 4 plates (Thermo) with 1 \u00b5g/ml of huIL-6 (50 \u00b5l/well) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Hyclone) overnight at 4 \u00b0C. On the day of the assay, plates were washed 3 times with PBS /Tween 20 (PBST tablets, Calbiochem). Plates were then blocked with 200 \u00b5l/well of 0.5% fish skin gelatin (FSG, Sigma) in PBS for 30 minutes at 37 \u00b0C. Blocking solution was removed, and plates were blotted. Serum samples were made (bleeds and pre-bleeds) at a starting dilution of 1:100 (all dilutions were made in FSG 50 \u00b5l/well) followed by 1:10 dilutions across the plate (column 12 was left blank for background control). Plates were incubated for 30 minutes at 37 \u00b0C. Plates were washed 3 times with PBS/Tween 20. Goat anti-rabbit FC-HRP (Pierce) d",

In addition, each well contained 50K cells/well of irradiated EL-4.B5 cells (5,000 Rads) and an appropriate level of T cell supernatant (ranging from 1-5% depending on preparation) in high glucose modified RPMI medium at a final volume of 250 \u00b5L/well. Cultures were incubated for 5 to 7 days at 37 \u00b0C in 4% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>Identification of Selective Antibody Secreting B CellsCultures were tested for antigen recognition and functional activity between days 5 and 7.</p>Antigen Recognition ScreeningThe ELISA format used is as described above except 50 \u00b5L of supernatant from the B cell cultures (BCC) wells (all 30 plates) was used as the source of the antibody. The conditioned medium was transferred to antigen-coated plates. After positive wells were identified, the supernatant was removed and transferred to a 96-well master plate(s). The original culture plates were then frozen by removing all the supernatant except 40 \u00b5L/well and adding 60 \u00b5L/well of 16% DMSO in FBS. Plates were wrapped in paper towels to slow freezing and placed at -70 \u00b0C.</p>Functional Activity ScreeningMaster plates were then screened for functional activity in the T1165 proliferation assay as described before, except row B was media only for background control, row C was media + IL-6 for positive proliferation control, and rows D-G and columns 2-11 were the wells from the BCC (50 \u00b5L/well, single points). 40 \u00b5L of IL-6 was added to all wells except the media row at 2.5 times the EC50 concentration determined for the assay. After 1 h incubation, the Ab/Ag complex was transferred to a tissue culture (TC) treated, 96-well, flat-bottom plate. 20 \u00b5L of cell suspension in modified RPMI medium without huIL-6 (T1165 at 20,000 cells/well) was added to all wells (100 \u00b5L final volume per well). Background was subtracted, and observed OD values were transformed into % of inhibition.</p>B cell recoveryPlates containing wells of interest were removed from -70 \u00b0C, and the cells from each well were recovered with 5-200 \u00b5L washes of medium/well. The washes were pooled in a 1.5 ml sterile centrifuge tube, and cells were pelleted for 2 minutes at 1500 rpm.</p>The tube was inverted, the spin repeated, and the supernatant carefully removed. Cells were resuspended in 100 \u00b5L/tube of medium. 100 \u00b5L biotinylated IL-6 coated streptavidin M280 dynabeads (Invitrogen) and 16 \u00b5L of goat anti-rabbit H&amp;L IgG-FITC diluted 1:100 in medium was added to the cell suspension.</p>20 \u00b5L of cell/beads/FITC suspension was removed, and 5 \u00b5L droplets were prepared on a glass slide (Corning) previously treated with Sigmacote (Sigma), 35 to 40 droplets/slide. An impermeable barrier of paraffin oil (JT Baker) was added to submerge the droplets, and the slide was incubated for 90 minutes at 37 \u00b0C, 4% CO<sub>2</sub> in the dark.</p>Specific B cells that produce antibody can be identified by the fluorescent ring around them due to antibody secretion, recognition of the bead-associated biotinylat",

The recombinant yeast-derived humanized antibody is evaluated for functional activity through the IL-6 driven T1165 cell proliferation assay and IL-6 stimulated HepG2 haptoglobin assay described above.</p>Example 9 Acute Phase Response Neutralization by Intravenous Administration of Anti-IL-6 Antibody Ab1.Human IL-6 can provoke an acute phase response in rats, and one of the major acute phase proteins that is stimulated in the rat is \u03b1-2 macroglobulin (A2M). A study was designed to assess the dose of antibody Ab1 required to ablate the A2M response to a single s.c. injection of 100 \u00b5g of human IL-6 given one hour after different doses (0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg) of antibody Ab1 administered intravenously (n=10 rats/dose level) or polyclonal human IgG1 as the control (n=10 rats). Plasma was recovered and the A2M was quantitated via a commercial sandwich ELISA kit (ICL Inc., Newberg OR; cat. no.- E-25A2M). The endpoint was the difference in the plasma concentration of A2M at the 24 hour time point (post-Ab1). The results are presented in Fig. 4.</p>The IC50 for antibody Ab1 was 0.1 mg/kg with complete suppression of the A2M response at the 0.3 mg/kg. This firmly establishes in vivo neutralization of human IL-6 can be accomplished by antibody Ab1.</p>Example 10 RXF393 Cachexia Model Study 1.IntroductionThe human renal cell cancer cell line, RXF393 produces profound weight loss when transplanted into athymic nude mice. Weight loss begins around day 15 after transplantation with 80% of all animals losing at least 30% of their total body weight by day 18 - 20 after transplantation. RXF393 secretes human IL-6 and the plasma concentration of human IL-6 in these animals is very high at around 10ng/ml. Human IL-6 can bind murine soluble IL-6 receptor and activate IL-6 responses in the mouse. Human IL-6 is approximately 10 times less potent than murine IL-6 at activating IL-6 responses in the mouse. The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of antibody Ab1, on survival, body weight, serum amyloid A protein, hematology parameters, and tumor growth in athymic nude mice transplanted with the human renal cell cancer cell line, RXF393.</p>MethodsEighty, 6 week old, male athymic nude mice were implanted with RXF393 tumor fragments (30-40 mg) subcutaneously in the right flank. Animals were then divided into eight groups of ten mice. Three groups were given either antibody Ab1 at 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, or 30 mg/kg intravenously weekly on day 1, day 8, day 15 and day 22 after transplantation (progression groups). Another three gr",
    "-blot based assay. The form of human IL-6 utilized in this example had a sequence of 183 amino acids in length (shown below). A 57-member library of overlapping 15 amino acid peptides encompassing this sequence was commercially synthesized and covalently bound to a PepSpots nitrocellulose membrane (JPT Peptide technologies, Berlin, Germany). The sequences of the overlapping 15 amino acid peptides are shown in Fig. 12. Blots were prepared and probed according to the manufacturer's recommendations.</p>Briefly, blots were pre-wet in methanol, rinsed in PBS, and blocked for over 2 hours in 10% non-fat milk in PBS/0.05% Tween (Blocking Solution). The Ab1 antibody was used at 1 mg/ml final dilution, and the HRP-conjugated Mouse Anti-Human-Kappa secondary antibody (Southern BioTech #9220-05) was used at a 1:5000 dilution. Antibody dilutions/incubations were performed in blocking solution. Blots were developed using Amersham ECL advance reagents (GE# RPN2135) and chemiluminescent signal documented using a CCD camera (Alphalnnotec). The results of the blots are shown in Fig. 13 and Fig. 14.</p>The sequence of the form of human IL-6 utilized to generate peptide library is set forth:\n<img id=\"ib0005\" path=\"imgb0005.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/416054846/EP/20171220/B1/000002/37/61/26/imgb0005.tif\"/></p>Example 15 Ab1 has high affinity for IL-6.Surface plasmon resonance was used to measure association rate (K<sub>a</sub>), dissociation rate (K<sub>d</sub>) and dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) for Ab1 to IL-6 from rat, mouse, dog, human, and cynomolgus monkey at 25 \u00b0C (Fig. 15A). The dissociation constant for human IL-6 was 4 pM, indicating very high affinity. As expected, affinity generally decreased with phylogenetic distance from human. The dissociation constants of Ab1 for IL-6 of cynomolgus monkey, rat, and mouse were 31 pM, 1.4 nM, and 0.4 nM, respectively. Ab1 affinity for dog IL-6 below the limit of quantitation of the experiment.</p>The high affinity of Ab1 for mouse, rat, and cynomolgus monkey IL-6 suggest that Ab1 may be used to inhibit IL-6 of these species. This hypothesis was tested using a cell proliferation assay. In brief, each species's IL-6 was used to stimulate proliferation of T1165 cells, and the concentration at which Ab1 could inhibit 50% of proliferation (IC50) was measured. Inhibition was consistent with the measured dissociation constants (Fig. 15B). These results demonstrate that Ab1 can inhibit the native IL-6 of these species, and suggest the use of these organisms for in vitro or in vivo modeling of IL-6 inhibition by Ab1.</p>Example 16 Multi-dose Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of Antibody Ab1 in Healthy Human Volunteers.Antibody Ab1 was dosed in a single bolus infusion in histidine and sorbitol to healthy human volunteers. Dosages of 1 mg, 3 mg, 10 mg, 30 mg or 100 mg were administered to each individual in dosage groups containing five to six individuals. Plasma samples were removed at fixed time intervals for up to twelve weeks. Human plasma was collected via venipuncture into a vacuum collection tube containing EDTA. Plasma was separated and used to assess the circulating levels of Ab1 using a monoclonal antibody specific for Ab1, as follows. A 96 well microtiter plate was coated overnight with the monoclonal antibody specific for Ab1 in 1X PBS overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The remaining steps were conducted at room temperature. The wells were aspirated and subsequently blocked using 0.5% Fish Skin Gelatin (FSG) (Sigma) in 1X PBS for 60 minutes. Human plasma samples were then added and incubated for 60 minutes, then aspirated, then 50 \u00b5L of 1 \u00b5g/mL biotinylated IL-6 was then added to each well and incubated for 60 minutes. The wells were aspirated, and 50 \u00b5L streptavidin-HRP (Pharmingen), diluted 1:5,000 in 0.5% FSG/PBS, was added "
