{"raw_mentions": "Unfortunately, there are no sentences that contain all four required components: a specific molecule name, ID or other identifier, a bioactivity metric, a specific numeric value for that metric, and a unit for that value. The text primarily describes experimental conditions and methods for various assays, but it does not provide specific bioactivity data that meet the criteria.\n\n\nHowever, I can suggest some sentences that contain some of the required components, but not all:\n\n\n* The ability of test compounds to inhibit the activity of Jarid1B was determined in a 384-well plate format under the following reaction conditions 0.8nM Jarid1B, 300nM H3K4me 3-biotin-labeled peptide (Anaspec cat #64357), ... and the ratio (665/615) was calculated for each well and fitted to determine the Inhibition Constant (IC)<sub>50</sub>).\n* The ability of test compounds to inhibit the activity of JMJD2C was determined in a 384-well plate format under the following reaction conditions 0.3nM JMJD2C, 300nM H3K9me 3-biotin-labeled peptide (Anaspec cat #64360), ... and the reaction products were quantified by Perkinme FRET-FRET.\n* The assay reaction was initiated by adding to each well of the plate 900nM of H3K4me 3-biotin-labeled peptide and 2. mu.L of a 2. mu.L mixture of 6. mu.M \u03b1 -ketoglutaric acid and 2. mu.L of an 11-point serially diluted inhibitor in 3% DMSO, followed by 2. mu.L of 2.4nM Jarid1B to initiate the reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes and terminated by adding 6. mu.L of 5mM EDTA in a LANCE detection buffer containing 50nM Phytolink streptavidin-allophycocyanin and 2nM europium-anti-H3K 4me1-2 antibody after 1 hour incubation at room temperature, the plates were read in TR-FRET mode (excitation at 320nM, emission at 615nM and 665 nM) by an EnVision Multilabel Reader, the ratio (665/615) was calculated for each well and fitted to determine the Inhibition Constant (IC)<sub>50</sub>).\n* The assay reaction was initiated by adding to each well of the plate 900nM of H3K9me 3-biotin-labeled peptide and 2. mu.L of a 2. mu.L mixture of 6. mu.M \u03b1 -ketoglutaric acid and 2. mu.L of an 11-point serially diluted inhibitor in 3% DMSO, followed by 2. mu.L of 0.9nM JMJD2C to initiate the reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes and terminated by adding 6. mu.L of 5mM EDTA in a LANCE detection buffer containing 100nM Phytolink streptavidin-allophycocyanin and 2nM europium-anti-H3K 9me2 antibody after 1 hour incubation at room temperature, the plates were read in TR-FRET mode (excitation at 320nM, emission at 615nM and 665 nM) by EnVision Multilabel Reader.\n\n\nNote that these sentences do not contain specific numeric values for the bioactivity metrics, so they do not meet the required criteria."}
