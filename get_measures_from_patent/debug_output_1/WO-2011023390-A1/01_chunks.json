    "l ((CUB domain containing protein 1, B345, CD318, SIMA135, TRASK; SEQ ID NO: 1 and variants with mutation R525Q (i.e. replacement of</p>Arginine (R) with Glutamine (Q) at amino acid position 525 of SEQ ID NO: 1) and/or mutation G709D (i.e. replacement of Glycine (G) with Aspartic acid (D) at amino acid position 709 of SEQ ID NO: I)) is a transmembrane protein containing three extracellular CUB domains. This protein is found to be overexpressed in colon and lung cancers. Its expression level is correlated with the metastatic ability \n\n of carcinoma cells. It has been shown to be tyrosine phosphorylated in a cancer cell line.

The binding affinity is of KD- value of 1.0 x 10<sup>\"8</sup> mol/1 or lower, preferably of a KD-value of 1.0 xlO<sup>\"9</sup> mol/1 or lower. The binding affinity is determined with a standard binding assay, such as surface plasmon resonance technique (Biacore\u00ae). Thus an \"antibody specifically binding to human CDCPl\" as used herein refers to an antibody binding to human CDCPl antigen with a binding affinity of KD 1.0 x 10<sup>\"8</sup> mol/1 or lower (e.g. of KD 1.0 x 10<sup>\"8</sup> mol/1 - 1.0 x 10<sup>\"13</sup> mol/1, preferably of KD 1.0 x 10<sup>\"9</sup> mol/1 - 1.0 x 10<sup>\"12</sup> mol/1). </p>The invention further comprises an antibody specifically binding to human CDCPl, characterized in that the heavy chain variable domain is SEQ ID NO: 15 and the light chain variable domain is SEQ ID NO: 16, or a humanized version thereof.

Flow cells were activated with a 1 :1 mixture of 0.1 M N-hydroxysuccinimide and 0.4 M 1- ethyl-3-(3- dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide at a flow rate of 5 \u03bcl/min. Anti-CDCPl antibodies CUB4 (Deposition No. DSM ACC2551) was injected in sodium acetate, pH 4.5-5.0 at 10-30 \u03bcg/ml, 12 minutes, which resulted in a surface density of approx 15000 RU. Surfaces were blocked with an injection of 1 M ethanolamine/HCl pH 8.5. Soluble ECD of human CDCPl (SEQ. ID NO.:2) (analyte 1) and anti-CDCPl antibodies (analyte 2) were diluted in PBST + 0.8M</p>NaCl and injected at a flow rate of 30 \u03bcl/min. The contact time (association phase) was 150-200 sec for the ECD of human CDCPl at a concentration of 250 nM- 50OnM and 300 sec for the anti-CDCPl antibody at a concentration of 100 nM. \n\n Then the chip surface was washed with PBST + 0.8M NaCl for 3 min (dissociation phase). All interactions were performed at exactly 25<sup>0</sup>C (standard temperature). A regeneration solution of 10 raM Glycine, pH 2.0 was injected for 60-150 sec to remove any non-covalently bound protein after each binding cycle. Signals were detected at a detection rate of one signal per second. </p>To determine whether an anti-CDCPl antibody binds to the same or a different epitope of human CDCPl as CUB4, th"
