ID NO.:2) (analyte 1) and anti-CDCPl antibodies (analyte 2) were diluted in PBST + 0.8M NaCl and injected at a flow rate of 30 \u03bcl/min. The contact time (association phase) was 150-200 sec for the ECD of human CDCPl at a concentration of 250 nM- 50OnM and 300 sec for the anti-CDCPl antibody at a concentration of 100 nM.\n\n\nA regeneration solution of 10 mM Glycine, pH 2.0 was injected for 60-150 sec to remove any non-covalently bound protein after each binding cycle.\n\n\nAnti-CDCPl antibodies CUB4 (Deposition No. DSM ACC2551) was injected in sodium acetate, pH 4.5-5.0 at 10-30 \u03bcg/ml, 12 minutes, which resulted in a surface density of approx 15000 RU."}
