    "S2222 (Diapharma/Chromogenix, West Chester, Ohio) was measured both in the absence and presence of compounds of the present invention. Hydrolysis of the substrate resulted in the release of pNA, which was monitored spectrophotometrically by measuring the increase in absorbance at 405 um. A decrease in the rate of absorbance change at 405 nm in the presence of inhibitor is indicative of enzyme inhibition. The results of this assay are expressed as inhibitory constant, K<sub>i</sub>. </p>[0543] Factor Xa determinations were made in 0.10 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.20 M NaCl, and 0.5% PEG 8000. The Michaelis constant, K<sub>m</sub>, for substrate hydrolysis was determined at 25\u00b0 C. using the method of Lineweaver and Burk. Values of K<sub>i </sub>were determined by allowing 0.2-0.5 nM human factor Xa (Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, Ind.) to react with the substrate (0.20 mM-1 mM) in the presence of inhibitor. Reactions were allowed to go for 30 min and the velocities (rate of absorbance change vs. time) were measured in the time frame of 25-30 min. The following relationship was used to calculate K<sub>i </sub>values:</p>(v<sub>o</sub>\u2212v<sub>s</sub>)/v<sub>s</sub>=I/(K<sub>i</sub>(1+S/K<sub>m</sub>))</p>[0544] where: </p>[0545] v<sub>o </sub>is the velocity of the control in the absence of inhibitor; </p>[0546] v<sub>s </sub>is the velocity in the presence of inhibitor; </p>[0547] I is the concentration of inhibitor; </p>[0548] K<sub>i </sub>is the dissociation constant of the enzyme:inhibitor complex; </p>[0549] S is the concentration of substrate; </p>[0550] K<sub>m </sub>is the Michaelis constant. </p>[0551] Compounds tested in the above assay are considered to be active if they exhibit a K<sub>i </sub>of \u226610 \u03bcM. Preferred compounds of the present invention have K<sub>i</sub>'s of \u22661 \u03bcM. More preferred compounds of the present invention have K<sub>i</sub>'s of \u22660.1 \u03bcM. Even more preferred compounds of the present invention have K<sub>i</sub>'s of \u22660.01 \u03bcM. Still more preferred compounds of the present invention have K<sub>i</sub>'s of \u22660.001 \u03bcM. Using the methodology described above, a number of compounds of the present invention were found to exhibit K<sub>i</sub>'s of &lt;10 \u03bcM, thereby confirming the utility of the compounds of the present invention as effective Xa inhibitors. </p>[0552] The antithrombotic effect of compounds of the present invention can be demonstrated in a rabbit arterio-venous (AV) shunt thrombosis model. In this model, rabbits weighing 2-3 kg anesthetized with a mixture of xylazine (10 mg/kg i.m.) and ketamine (50 mg/kg i.m.) are used. A saline-filled AV shunt device is connected between the femoral arterial and the femoral venous cannulae. The AV shunt device consists of a piece of 6-cm tygon tubing that contains a piece of silk thread. Blood will flow from the femoral artery via the AV-shunt into the femoral vein. The exposure of flowing blood to a silk thread will induce the formation of a ",
    "n, and as reagents used as anticoagulants in the processing of blood to plasma for diagnostic and other commercial purposes. </p>[0554] Some compounds of the present invention were shown to be direct acting inhibitors of the serine protease thrombin by their ability to inhibit the cleavage of small molecule substrates by thrombin in a purified system. In vitro inhibition constants were determined by the method described by Kettner et al. in J. Biol. Chem. 265, 18289-18297 (1990), herein incorporated by reference. In these assays, thrombin-mediated hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate S2238 (Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, Tex.) was monitored spectrophotometrically. Addition of an inhibitor to the assay mixture results in decreased absorbance and is indicative of thrombin inhibition. Human thrombin (Enzyme Research Laboratories, Inc., South Bend, Ind.) at a concentration of 0.2 nM in 0.10 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 0.20 M NaCl, and 0.5% PEG 6000, was incubated with various substrate concentrations ranging from 0.20 to 0.02 mM. After 25 to 30 min of incubation, thrombin activity was assayed by monitoring the rate of increase in absorbance at 405 nm that arises owing to substrate hydrolysis. Inhibition constants were derived from reciprocal plots of the reaction velocity as a function of substrate concentration using the standard method of Lineweaver and Burk. Using the methodology described above, some compounds of this invention were evaluated and found to exhibit a Ki of less than 10 Jlm, thereby confirming the utility of the compounds of the present invention as effective thrombin inhibitors. </p>[0555] The compounds are administered to a mammal in a therapeutically effective amount. By \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d it is meant an amount of a compound of the present invention that, when administered alone or in combination with an additional therapeutic agent to a mammal, is effective to treat a thromboembolic condition or disease. </p>[0556] The compounds of the present invention can be administered alone or in combination with one or more additional therapeutic agents. By \u201cadministered in combination\u201d or \u201ccombination therapy\u201d it is meant that a compound of the present invention and one or more additional therapeutic agents are administered concurrently to the mammal being treated. When administered in combination each component may be administered at the same time or sequentially in any order at different points in time. Thus, each component may be administered separately but sufficiently closely in time so as to provide the desired therapeutic effect. </p>[0557] Additional therapeutic agents include other anti-coagulant or coagulation inhibitory agents, anti-platelet or platelet inhibitory agents, thrombin inhibitors, thrombolytic or fibrinolytic agents, anti-arrythmic agents, anti-hypertensive agents, calcium channel blockers (L-type and T-type), cardiac glycosides, diruetics, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, phospodies"
