    "on in the range of 0.010nM to 50 \u03bcm. Cells were incubated for 30min at room temperature. Intracellular cAMP levels were determined using HTRF HIRANGE CAMP assay kit (Cisbio) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Solutions of anti-cAMP and d2 fluorophore-labeled cAMP conjugated to the wells were prepared separately in provided lysis buffer. After the reaction was completed, the cells were lysed with equal volumes of d2-cAMP solution and anti-cAMP solution. After 1h incubation at room temperature, the time-resolved fluorescence intensities were measured using Envision (Perkin-Elmer) under excitation at 400nm and at dual emission at 590nm and 665 nm. Calibration curves were constructed by plotting the ratio of fluorescence intensity emitted from 665nm to the fluorescence intensity emitted from 590nm versus cAMP concentration with external cAMP standards at concentrations ranging from 2.7. Mu.M to 0.1 pM. The potency and activity of a compound to inhibit cAMP production is then determined by fitting a 4-parameter logistic equation from a plot of cAMP levels versus compound concentration.</p>The examples disclosed below were tested in the human RXFP1 (hRXFP 1) HEK293 cAMP assay described above and found to have agonist activity.
