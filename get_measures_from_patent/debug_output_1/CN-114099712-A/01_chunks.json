When vancomycin is administered, the patient is given a lower dose than usual. It is expected that host cell infection will be knocked down and resistance to phage drugs will not be established or will be established at a lower rate or severity than usual. In other experiments, the design was the same except that in those experiments the phage also targeted the essential S.aureus gene ftsZ (Liang et al, Int J feed Dis. 2015 1 month; 30:1-6. doi: 10.1016/j.ijid.2014.09.015.2014 11 month 5 electronic publication, \"inhibition of the growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in vitro with antisense peptide nucleic acid conjugates targeting the ftsZ gene\" (Inhibiting the growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in vitro with antisense peptide nucleic acid conjugates targeting the ftsZ gene) \").</p>Additional experiments the above experiments were repeated, but phage K endolysin was administered in addition or in place of methicillin.</p>Reference to the literature</p>1.

    "is one factor in the initiation of a potential explosive epidemic. Cholera is an extremely fatal disease. It affects both children and adults and can be killed within hours. About 80% of people infected with Vibrio cholerae do not present any symptoms, although the bacteria are present in their feces for 1-10 days after infection and may infect other people by flowing back into the environment. Of the symptomatic people, 80% have mild or moderate symptoms, while approximately 20% develop acute watery diarrhea with severe dehydration. If not treated in time, death may result. </p>Two serotypes of Vibrio cholerae (O1 and O139) cause outbreaks. The outbreak of the disease caused by Vibrio cholerae O1 is most prevalent, and O139, first discovered in Bengal in 1992, was restricted to south east Asia. non-O1 and non-O139 Vibrio cholerae cause mild diarrhea but do not produce epidemics. Recently, new variants have been discovered in certain parts of asia and africa. Observations indicate that these strains cause more severe cholera and have a higher mortality rate. The main reservoirs of Vibrio cholerae are human and aqueous sources, such as brackish water and estuaries, commonly associated with algal blossoms.</p>With reference to Nature, 2013, 28.2.494 (7438):489-91. doi: 10.1038/nature11927, \"bacteriophages encode their own CRISPR/Cas adaptive response to escape innate immunity of the host (A bacteriophages encoding own CRISPR/Cas adaptive response to viral host immunity)\", Seed KD et al (incorporated herein by reference), which describes serotype Vibrio cholerae O1 as the main pathogen of the severe diarrheal disease cholera, and bacteriophages that lyse Vibrio cholerae have been implicated in affecting the disease burden, particularly in endemic areas around the gulf Banglada. The authors describe the isolation of ICP1 (used in the International center for diarrhea research, Bengal cholera bacteriophage 1) -in relation to Vibrio cholerae O1-specific lethal Myoviruses, which are ubiquitous in the rice-water stool samples of cholera patients collected from 2001-. </p>The authors explained that the ICP1 CRISPR/Cas system consists of two CRISPR sites (named CR1 and CR2) and six Cas genes, whose tissue and protein products have the highest homology to the Cas protein of the subtype 1-F (yersinia pestis) system 17. Vibrio cholerae is classified into two biotypes, the classical biotype and the Eltor biotype, wherein the former is associated with an early epidemic pandemic and has been replaced by the Eltor biotype 18. The classical strain Vibrio cholerae O395 has a CRISPR/Cas system belonging to subtype 17 type 1-E (E.coli), and to date, no description has been given of any E.coli strain having a CRISPR/CAS system. Therefore, the origin of the CRISPR/Cas system in ICP1 phage is unknown.</p>The RNA sequence of the CR1 and CR2 consensus direct repeat is as follows, with the partial palindromic sequence forming the predicted stem in the crRNA underlined:</p>"
