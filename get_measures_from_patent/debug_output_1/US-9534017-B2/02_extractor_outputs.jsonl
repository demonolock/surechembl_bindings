{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nThe dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and can be expressed as the ratio, LD50/ED50.\nA dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 (the concentration of the test compound that achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture.\nIn general, the dose equivalent of a modulator is from about 1 ng/kg to 10 mg/kg for a typical subject.\nIt may be appropriate to administer the required dose as two, three, four or more sub-doses at appropriate intervals throughout the day.\nMore specifically it is contemplated that an effective amount would be to continuously infuse by intravenous administration from 0.01 micrograms/kg body weight/min to 100 micrograms/kg body weight/min for a period of 12 hours to 14 days.\nIn general it is contemplated that an effective amount would be from 0.001 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg body weight, and in particular from 0.01 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg body weight."}
