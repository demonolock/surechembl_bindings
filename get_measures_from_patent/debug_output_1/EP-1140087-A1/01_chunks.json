    "t of organic synthesis that the functionality present on the molecule should be consistent with the transformations proposed. This will sometimes require a judgment to modify the order of the synthetic steps or to select one particular process scheme over another in order to obtain a desired compound of the invention. It will also be recognized that another major consideration in the planning of any synthetic route in this field is the judicious choice of the protecting group used for protection of the reactive functional groups present in the compounds described in this invention. An authoritative account describing the many alternatives to the trained practitioner is Greene and Wuts ( Protective Groups In Organic Synthesis, Wiley and Sons, 1991). \n\n Generally, compounds described in the scope of this patent application can be synthesized by the route described in Scheme 1. The appropriately substituted pyrrolidine (n=0) or piperidine (n=l) 1 is alkylated by a N-protected alkylhalide (halide = Cl, Br, I), mesylate, tosylate or triflate, 2, (where E represents a linkage described within the scope of this application in its fully elaborated form with the appropriate protecting groups as understood by one skilled in the art or in a precursor form which can be later elaborated into its final form by methods familiar to one skilled in the art) with or without base or an acid scavenger to yield the piperidinyl- or pyrrolidinylalkyl protected amine 3_. If the halide is not I, then KI can also be added to facilitate the displacement, provided the solvent is suitable, such as an alcohol, 2-butanone, DMF or DMSO, amongst others. The displacement can be performed at room temperature to the reflux temperature of the solvent. The protecting group is subsequently removed to yield amine 4. Protecting groups include phthalimide which can be removed by hydrazine, a reaction familiar to one skilled in the art; bis-BOC which can be removed by either TFA or HC1 dissolved in a suitable solvent, both procedures being familiar to one skilled in the art; a nitro group instead of an amine which can be reduced to yield an amine by conditions familiar to one skilled in the art; 2, 4-dimethyl pyrrole (S. P. Breukelman, et al. J. Chem. Soc . Perkin Trans. I, 1984, 2801); N- 1, 1, 4, 4-Tetramethyl-disilylazacyclopentane (STABASE) (S. Djuric, J. Venit, and P. Magnus Tet . Lett 1981, 22, 1787) and other protecting groups. Reaction with an isocyanate or isothiocyanate 5<sub>.</sub> (Z = 0,S) yields urea or thiourea 6 . Reaction with a chloroformate or chlorothioformate 1_ (Z=0,S) such as o-, p-nitrophenyl-chloroformate or phenylchloroformate (or their thiocarbonyl equivalents) , followed by diplacement with an amine 9<sub>.</sub>, also yields the corresponding urea or thiourea 6 . Likewise, reaction of carbamate 8 (X - H, or 2- or 4-N02) with disubstituted \n\namine 10<sub>.</sub> yields trisubstituted urea or thiourea 12.

Exp. Med., 183, 2437-2448 (1996) and Uguccioni et al . , J. Clin. Invest., 100, 1137- 1143 (1997). Cell lines for expressing the receptor of interest include those naturally expressing the chemokine receptor, such as EO -3 or THP-1, those induced to express the chemokine receptor by the addition of chemical or protein agents, such as HL-60 or AM 14.3D10 cells treated with, for example, butyric acid with interleukin-5 present, or a cell engineered to express a recombinant chemokine receptor, such as CHO or HEK-293. Finally, blood or tissue cells, for example human peripheral blood eosinophils, isolated using methods as described by Hansel et al . , J. \n\nImmunol. Methods, 145, 105- 110 (1991), can be utilized in such assays. In particular, the compound of the present invention have activity in binding to the CCR-3 receptor in the aforementioned assays. As used herein, \"activity\" is intended to mean a compound demonstrating an IC50 of 10 \u03bcM or lower in concentration when measured in the aforementioned assays. Such a result is indicative of the intrinsic activity of the compounds as modulators of chemokine receptor activity. A general binding protocol is described below.</p>\n  CCR3 -Receptor Binding Protocol</p>\n  Millipore filter plates (#MABV 1250 ) are treated with 5 \u03bcg/ml protamine in phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.2, for ten minutes at room temperature. Plates are washed three times with phosphate buffered saline and incubated with phosphate buffered saline for thirty minutes at room temperature. For binding, 50 \u03bcl of binding buffer (0.5% bovine serum albumen, 20 mM HEPES buffer and 5 mM magnesium chloride in RPMI 1640 media) with or without a test concentration of a compound present at a known concentration is combined with 50 \u03bcl of 125-1 labeled human eotaxin (to give a final concentration of 150 pM radioligand) and 50 \u03bcl of cell suspension in binding buffer containing 5xl0<sup>5</sup> total cells. Cells used for such binding assays can include cell lines transfected with a gene expressing CCR3 such as that described by Daugherty et al . (1996) , isolated human eosinophils such as described by Hansel et al . (1991) or the AM 14.3D10 cell line after differentiation with butyric acid as described by Tiffany et al . (1998). The mixture of compound, cells and radioligand are incubated at room temperature for thirty minutes. Plates are placed onto a vacuum manifold, vacuum applied, and plates washed three times with binding buffer with 0.5M NaCl added. The plastic skirt is removed from the plate, the plate allowed to air dry, the wells punch \n\nout and CPM counted. The percent inhibition of binding is calculated using the total count obtained in the absence of any competing compound or chemokine ligand and the background binding determined by addition of 100 nM eotaxin in place of the test compound.</p>\n  The utility of the compounds in accordance with the present invention as inhibitors of the migration of eosinophils or cell lines expressing the chemokine receptors may be demonstrated by methodology known in the art, such as the chemotaxis assay disclosed by Bacon et al., Brit. J. Pharmacol., 95, 966-974 (1988). In particular, the compound of the present invention have activity in inhibition of the migration of eosinophils in the aforementioned assays. As used herein, \"activity\" is intended to mean a compound demonstrating an IC50 of 10 \u03bcM or lower in concentration when measured in the aforementioned assays . Such a result is indicative of the intrinsic activity of the compounds as modulators of chemokine receptor activity. A human eosinophil chemotaxis assay protocol is described below.</p>\n  Human Eosinophil Chemotaxis Assay</p>\n  Neuroprobe MBA96 96-well chemotaxis chambers with</p>\n  Neuroprobe polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate PFD5 5- micron filters in place are warmed in a 37\u00b0C incubator prior to assay. Freshly isolated human eosinophils, isolated according to a method such as that described by Hansel et al. (1991), are suspended in RPMI 1640 with 0.1% bovine serum albumin at 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml and warmed in a 37\u00b0C incubator prior to assay. A 20 nM solution of human eotaxin in RPMI 1640 with 0.1% bovine serum albumin is warmed in a 37\u00b0C incubator prior to assay. The eosinophil suspension and the 20 nM eotaxin solution are each mixed</p>\n  1:1 with prewarmed RPMI 1640 with 0.1% bovine serum albumin with or without a dilution of a test compound that is at \n\ntwo fold the desired final concentration. These mixtures are warmed in a 37\u00b0C incubator prior to assay. The filter is separated from the prewarmed Neuroprobe chemotaxis chamber and the eotaxin/compound mixture is placed into a Polyfiltronics MPC 96 well plate that has been placed in the bottom part of the Neuro Probe chemotaxis chamber. The approximate volume is 370 microliters and there should be a positive meniscus after di",
    "a target for interfering with or promoting immune cell function in a mammal, such as a human. Compounds that inhibit or promote chemokine receptor function are particularly useful for modulating immune cell function for therapeutic purposes. Accordingly, the present invention is directed to compounds which are useful in the prevention and/or treatment of a wide variety of inflammatory, infectious, and immunoregulatory disorders and diseases, including asthma and allergic diseases, infection by pathogenic microbes (which, by definition, includes viruses) , as well as \n\nautoimmune pathologies such as the rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis .</p>\n  For example, an instant compound which inhibits one or more functions of a mammalian chemokine receptor (e.g., a human chemokine receptor) may be administered to inhibit (i.e., reduce or prevent) inflammation or infectious disease. As a result, one or more inflammatory process, such as leukocyte emigration, adhesion, chemotaxis, exocytosis (e.g., of enzymes, histamine) or inflammatory mediator release, is inhibited. For example, eosinophilic infiltration to inflammatory sites (e.g., in asthma or allergic rhinitis) can be inhibited according to the present method. In particular, the compound of the following examples has activity in blocking the migration of cells expressing the CCR-3 receptor using the appropriate chemokines in the aforementioned assays . As used herein, \"activity\" is intended to mean a compound demonstrating an IC50 of 10 \u03bcM or lower in concentration when measured in the aforementioned assays. Such a result is also indicative of the intrinsic activity of the compounds as modulators of chemokine receptor activity.</p>\n  Similarly, an instant compound which promotes one or more functions of the mammalian chemokine receptor (e.g., a human chemokine) as administered to stimulate (induce or enhance) an immune or inflammatory response, such as leukocyte emigration, adhesion, chemotaxis, exocytosis (e.g., of enzymes, histamine) or inflammatory mediator release, resulting in the beneficial stimulation of inflammatory processes. For example, eosinophils can be recruited to combat parasitic infections. In addition, treatment of the aforementioned inflammatory, allergic and autoimmune diseases can also be contemplated for an instant compound which promotes one or more functions of the mammalian chemokine receptor if one contemplates the delivery of sufficient compound to cause the loss of receptor expression on cells through the induction of chemokine receptor internalization or the delivery of \n\ncompound in a manner that results in the misdirection of the migration of cells.</p>\n  In addition to primates, such as humans, a variety of other mammals can be treated according to the method of the present invention. For instance, mammals, including but not limited to, cows, sheep, goats, horses, dogs, cats, guinea pigs, rats or other bovine, ovine, equine, canine, feline, rodent or murine species "
