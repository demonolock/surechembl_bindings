    "ods </p>Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Binding </p> Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) STING agonist binding studies were carried out using a Biacore T200 instrument (GE Healthcare) at 4\u00b0C in a 150 mM KCI, 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 1 mM TCEP, 2.5 mM MgCI2, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.005% (v/v) P20, 1 % (v/v) DMSO running buffer. The recombinant protein immobilized on the streptavidin chip was either human WT or H232R STING. A truncated construct of STING was used in all studies. The STING constructs were comprised of residues 155-341 with both N- and C-terminal truncations; the N-terminal transmembrane domains were removed (1 -154), as well as the C-terminal tail (342-379). A highly specific N- terminal biotinylation was achieved enzymatically with the E. coli biotin ligase (BirA) and inclusion of the high-affinity biotinylation peptide AviTag\u2122. A Carboxymethylated dextran pre-immobilized with streptavidin (series S Streptavidin CM5 Sensor Chip) was used to capture the biotinylated STING protein. Test compound injections were made at a flow rate of 100 pi per minute with a 60 second association time and variable dissociation time. A three-fold \n\n dilution series from a 10 mM starting concentration was used for all test compounds. Data analysis was performed using the BiacoreT200 data evaluation software package (GE Healthcare). Compound injections were referenced to both a blank surface and a buffer blank. Processed data were fit to an equilibrium or kinetic model to obtain the observed dissociation constant K<sub>D</sub>. SPR binding data is provided in Table 1 . </p><img id=\"imgf000077_0001\" path=\"imgf000077_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/525433085/WO/20190919/A1/002019/17/57/76/imgf000077_0001.tif\"/></p> Scintillation Proximity Assay (SPA) Competitive Binding \n\n A radioligand binding assay was developed to determine compound interactions were competitive with a tritium-labeled version of the native STING ligand, <sup>3</sup>H-cyclic guanine (2', 5') monophosphate adenine (3', 5') monophosphate (<sup>3</sup>H-cGAMP). The STING constructs (WT and H232R) were comprised of residues 155-341 with both N- and C-terminal truncations; the N- terminal transmembrane domains were removed (1-154), as well as the C-terminal tail (342- 379). A highly specific N- terminal biotinylation was achieved enzymatically with the E. coli biotin ligase (BirA) and inclusion of the high-affinity biotinylation peptide AviTag\u2122. 100 nM STING protein was immobilized on 20 pg streptavidin polyvinyl toluene (SA-PVT) beads in 150 mM NaCI, 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.005% (v/v) Tween-20, 1 % (v/v) DMSO. 100 nM <sup>3</sup>H-cGAMP and compounds were added and allowed to come to equilibrium at room temperature (20 min). Compounds were tested in three-fold dilution series from a 100 pM starting concentration and normalized to a positive control compound that completely blocked <sup>3</sup>H-cGAMP binding and the negative control DMSO. The Ki for competitive binding was determined from the IC<sub>5</sub>o with the Cheng-Prusoff equation (Cheng &amp; Prusoff, Biochemical Pharmacology, 22 (1973), pp. 3099-3108). The K<sub>D</sub> values for <sup>3</sup>H-cGAMP used in the Cheng- Prusoff equation were determined empirically to be 1 nM for WT STING, and 750 nM for R232H STING. SPA competitive binding data is provided in Table 2. </p><img id=\"imgf000078_0001\" path=\"imgf000078_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/525433044/WO/20190919/A1/002019/17/57/76/imgf000078_0001.tif\"/><img id=\"imgf000079_0001\" path=\"imgf000079_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/525433067/WO/20190919/A1/002019/17/57/76/imgf000079_0001.tif\"/></p>lnterferon-b Induction: THP-1 ISG Reporter Cell Line </p> THP-1 Lucia\u2122 ISG cells (InvivoGen) express the secreted luciferase \u201cLucia\u201d reporter gene under the control of an IRF-inducible composite promotor comprised of five interferon response elements. THP-1 Lucia\u2122 ISG cells were grown in RPMI media plus 2 mM L-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 0.5% Pen-Strep.
