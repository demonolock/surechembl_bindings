    "ich prevent the induction of tolerance, an in vitro T cell costimulation assay as described above can be used. In this case, T cells would be given the primary activation signal and contacted with a selected cytokine, but would not be given the costimulatory signal. After washing and resting the T cells, the cells would be rechallenged with both a primary activation signal and a costimulatory signal. If the T cells do not respond (e.g., proliferate or produce IL-2) they have become tolerized and the cytokine has not prevented the induction of tolerance. However, if the T cells respond, induction of tolerance has been prevented by the cytokine. Those cytokines which are capable of preventing the induction of tolerance can be targeted for blockage in vivo in conjunction with reagents which block B lymphocyte antigens as a more efficient means to induce tolerance in transplant recipients or subjects with autoimmune diseases. For example, one could administer a B7-2 blocking reagent together with a cytokine blocking antibody to a subject.</p>I. Identification of Molecules which Inhibit Costimulation</p>Another application of the peptide having the activity of a novel B lymphocyte antigen of the invention (e.g., B7-2 and B7-3) is the use of one or more of these peptides in screening assays to discover as yet undefined molecules which are inhibitors of costimulatory ligand binding and/or of intracellular signaling through T cells following costimulation. For example, a solid-phase binding assay using a peptide having the activity of a B lymphocyte antigen, such as B7-2, could be used to identify molecules which inhibit binding of the antigen with the appropriate T cell ligand (e.g., CTLA4, CD28). In addition, an in vitro T cell costimulation assay as described above could be used to identify molecules which interfere with intracellular signaling through the T cells following costimulation as determined by the ability of these molecules to inhibit T cell proliferation and/or cytokine production (yet which do not prevent binding of B lymphocyte antigens to their receptors). For example, the compound cyclosporine A inhibits T cell activation through stimulation via the T cell receptor pathway but not via the CD28/CTLA4 pathway. Therefore, a different intracellular signaling pathway is involved in costimulation. Molecules which interfere with intracellular signaling via the CD28/CTLA4 pathway may be effective as immunosuppressive agents in vivo (similar to the effects of cyclosporine A).</p>J. Identification of Molecules which Modulate B Lymphocyte Antigen Expression</p>The monoclonal antibodies produced using the proteins and peptides of the current invention can be used in a screening assay for molecules which modulate the expression of B lymphocyte antigens on cells. For example, molecules which effect intracellular signaling which leads to induction of B lymphocyte antigens, e.g. B7-2 or B7-3, can be identified by assaying expression of one or more B l",
    "-cell activation, several reports suggested that B7 (B7-1) and the molecule identified by monoclonal antibody BB-1 were distinct since they were differentially expressed on cell lines and B cell neoplasms (Freedman, A. S. et al. (1987) Immunol. 137, 3260-3267; Yokochi, T., et al. (1982) J. Immunol. 128, 823-827; Freeman, G. J., et al. (1989) J. Immunol 143, 2714-2722; Clark, E and Yokochi, T. (1984) Leukocyte Typing, 1st International References Workshop. 339-346; Clark, E., et al. (1984) Leukocyte Typing, 1st International References Workshop. 740). In addition, immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting with these IgM monoclonal antibodies suggested that they identified different molecules (Clark, E and Yokochi, T. (1984) Leukocyte Typing, 1st International References Workshop. 339-346; Clark, E., et al. (1984) Leukocyte Typing, 1st International References Workshop. 740). The original anti-B7 monoclonal antibody, 133, was generated by immunization with anti-immunoglobulin activated human B lymphocytes whereas the BB-1 monoclonal antibody was generated by immunization with a baboon cell line. Thus, the BB-1 monoclonal antibody must identify an epitope on human cells that is conserved between baboons and humans.</p>Following the molecular cloning and expression of the human B7 gene (B7-1), B7 transfected COS cells were found to be identically stained with the anti-B7 (133) and BB-1 monoclonal antibodies and that they both precipitated the identical broad molecular band (44-54 kD) strongly suggesting that they identified the same molecule (Freeman, G. J., et al. (1989) J. Immunol. 143, 2714-2722). This observation was unexpected since the gene encoding the molecule identified by the BB-1 monoclonal antibody had been previously mapped to chromosome 12 (Katz, F. E., et al. (1985) Eur. J. Immunol. 103-6), whereas the B7 gene was located by two groups on chromosome 3 (Freeman, G. J., et al. (1992) Blood. 79, 489-494; Selvakumar, A., et al. (1992) Immunogenetics 36, 175-181.). Subsequently, additional discrepancies between the phenotypic expression of B7 (B7-1) and the molecule identified by the BB-1 monoclonal antibody were noted. BB-1 monoclonal antibody stained thymic epithelial cells (Turka, L. A., et al. (1991) J. Immunol 146, 1428-36; Munro, J. M., et al. Blood submitted.) and keratinocytes (Nickoloff, B., et al (1993) Am. J. Pathol. 142, 1029-1040; Augustin, M., et al. (1993) J. Invest. Dermatol. 100, 275-281.) whereas anti-B7 did not. Recently, Nickoloff et al. (1993) Am. J. Pathol. 142, 1029-1040, reported discordant expression of the molecule identified by the BB-1 monoclonal antibody and B7 on keratinocytes using a BB-1 and anti-B7 (B1.1 and 133) monoclonal antibodies. Nickoloff et al. also demonstrated that these BB-1 positive cells did not express B7 mRNA yet bound CD28 transfected COS cells providing further support for the existence of a distinct protein which binds monoclonal antibody BB-1.</p>The present findings confirm that there is a",
    "/ml of goat anti-human IgG (H+ L) (Zymed, San Francisco, Calif.) in PBS. The plates were blocked for 1 hour with PBS/0.1% BSA and then incubated for an additional hour with cell culture supernatants from the transfected cells. After 5 washes with PBS/0.05% Tween, HRP-coupled goat anti-human IgG(H+ L) (Zymed) was added as a 1:1000 dilution in PBS. After a 1 hour incubation the plates were washed again, then enzymatically developed using an ABTS kit (Zymed) as described above.</p>Expression levels were approximately 3 \u03bcg/ml for the constructs. The B7Ig fusion proteins were purified from the supernatant of transfected host cells by protein A purification as follows. Protein A Sepharose IPA300 (Repligen, Cambridge, Mass.) was washed in OBB (1.5 M glycine, 3 M NaCl, pH 8.9), resuspended in DMEM, and added to cell culture supernatant at 1 ml/liter of supernatant. The solution was left to mix gently overnight at 4\u00b0 C. The Protein A sepharose was then pelleted, the majority of the supernatant was removed, and the remaining supernatant was used to resuspend the Protein-A Sepharose prior to loading onto a Poly-prep column (BioRad, Hercules, Calif.). The column was washed extensively with OBB and the immunoglobulin fusion protein was eluted in 0.1 M sodium citrate. Half volume column washes were collected into 1/10th volume 1 M Tris (pH9.0). Protein containing fractions were identified by a standard colorimetric reaction (BioRad), pooled, and dialyzed overnight against PBS in 6000-8000 KD dialysis tubing. The purified proteins were of the expected size and high purity, representing &gt;90% of total protein stained with Coomassie Blue on acrylamide gels.</p>The ability of various B7 family-Ig fusion proteins to competitively inhibit the binding of biotinylated-CTLA4Ig to immobilized B7-2Ig was determined. Competition binding assays were done as follows and analyzed according to McPherson (McPherson, G. A. (1985) J. Pharmacol. Methods 14:213-228). Soluble hCTLA4Ig was labelled with <sup>125</sup>I to a specific activity of approximately 2\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>cpm/pmol. hB7-2-Ig fusion protein was coated overnight onto microtiter plates at 10 mg/ml in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0, 50 ml/well. The wells were blocked with binding buffer (DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 0.1% BSA, and 50 mM BES, pH 6.8) for 2 h at room temperature. The labeled CTLA4-Ig (4 nM) was added to each well in the presence or absence of unlabeled competing Ig fusion proteins, including full-length B7-2 (hB7-2Ig), full-length B7-1 (hB7-1Ig), the variable region-like domain of B7-2 (hB7-2VIg) and the constant region-like domain of B7-2 (hB7-2CIg) and allowed to bind for 2.5 h at room temperature. The wells were washed once with ice-cold binding buffer and then four times with ice-cold PBS. Bound radioactivity was recovered by treatment of the wells with 0.5 N NaOH for 5 min and the solubilized material removed and counted in a gamma counter.</p>The results of these assays are shown in FIG. 15 i",
    "ially diluted in twofold steps to 15.6 ng/mL; 50 \u03bcL) was added to each well and incubated for 2.5 hours at room temperature. The wells were washed as above. The bound biotinylated B7-Ig was detected by the addition of 50 \u03bcl/well of a 1:2000 dilution of streptavidin-HRP (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, Ill.) for 30 minutes at room temperature. The wells were washed as above and 50 \u03bcL of ABTS (Zymed, Calif.) added and the developing blue color monitored at 405 nm after 30 min. The ability of unlabelled B7-1Ig or B7-2Ig to compete with biotinylated B7-1Ig or B7-2Ig, respectively, was assessed by mixing varying amounts of the competing protein with a quantity of biotinylated B7-1Ig or B7-2Ig shown to be non-saturating (i.e., 70 ng/mL; 1.5 nM) and performing the binding assays as described above. A reduction in the signal (Abs 405 nm) expected for biotinylated B7-1Ig or B7-2Ig indicated a competition for binding to immobilized CTLA4Ig.</p>Considering the previous evidence that CTLA4 was the high affinity receptor for B7-1, the avidity of binding of CTLA4 and CD28 to B7-1 and B7-2 was compared in assays as described above. In a first experiment, B7-1Ig or B7-2-Ig was labelled with biotin and bound to immobilized CTLA4-Ig in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled B7-1Ig or B7-2Ig. The experiment was repeated with <sup>125</sup>-I-labeled B7-1Ig or B7-2Ig. Representative results are shown in FIG. 16 (Panel A: B7-1Ig; Panel B: B7-2Ig). Using this solid phase binding assay, the avidity of B7-2 (2.7 nM) for CTLA4 was determined to be approximately two-fold lower than that observed for B7-1 (4.6 mM). The experimentally determined IC<sub>50 </sub>values are indicated in the upper right corner of the panels. The affinity of both B7-1 and B7-2 for CD28 was lower and was difficult to confidently determine.</p>G. Direct Binding Assays of Modified Forms of B7 Family Members to CTLA4Ig</p>Direct binding ELISA assays were performed to determine the level of binding of B7 family members as Ig fusions proteins to CTLA4. For these assays, the immunoglobulin fusion proteins were attached to plates and the amount of biotinylated CTLA4 binding to the plates was determined as described below.</p>Nunc Maxisorp plates were coated overnight at room temperature with 50 \u03bcl per well of a 20 \u03bcg/ml stock of the various B7Ig fusion proteins, or purified human IgG (Zymed) in PBS as described above. Human CTLA4Ig (Repligen) was biotinylated using NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.). Varying amounts of biotinylated CTLA4Ig were added to the plates and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. The plates were washed five times with PBS and then a 1:1000 dilution of streptavidin-HRP (Zymed) was added and left for 30\u2032 minutes on the plates. After another series of washes with PBS, the HRP reactivity was measured using an ABTS kit (Zymed) as described above.</p>The results, presented in FIG. 20, show that half-saturation occurred at 500 pM for B7-1Ig, and at "
