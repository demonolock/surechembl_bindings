    "mized) synthesized using adenine, guanine, cytidine, and either uridine or pseudouridine. </p>Transfection of mRNA into cultured mammalian cells and western blot to confirm expression of encoded protein </p> [00366] Translatability was assessed by in vitro transfection of the mRNA into cultured mammalian cells using Lipofectamine<sup>\u00ae</sup> 2000 reagent from Thermo Fisher Scientific. The \n\n transfected cells were then lysed 24 to 48 hours later, and the proteins in the lysates were resolved using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblot with antibodies specific to the protein encoded by the mRNA (see Figure 5 for a sample Western blot illustrating confirmation of human RXFP1 expression from mRNA). </p>Step 4.

Modified synthetic mRNAs encoding target protein (e.g., see Tables 1 -7) were packaged into lipid nanoparticles at a cationic lipid amine group to mRNA phosphate group (N:P) molar ratio = 4:1 , dialyzed, and concentrated. As an example, amounts are shown for the protocol resulting in ~2 mg packaged modified synthetic mRNA in a co"
