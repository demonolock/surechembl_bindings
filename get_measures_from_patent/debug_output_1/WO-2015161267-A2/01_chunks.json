    "(V<sub>L</sub>) by a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly, the V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> domains of one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary V<sub>L</sub> and V<sub>H</sub> domains of another fragment, thereby forming two antigen-binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use of single-chain Fv (sFv) dimers has also been reported. See Gruber et al., J. Immunol., 152:5368 (1994). Alternatively, the antibodies can be \"linear antibodies\" as described in Zapata et al. Protein Eng. 8(10): 1057-1062 (1995). Briefly, these antibodies comprise a pair of tandem Fd segments (V<sub>H</sub> -Cm- V<sub>H</sub> -C<sub>H</sub>1 ) which form a pair of antigen binding regions. Linear antibodies can be bispecific or monospecific. </p> [0032] Within the context of the present invention, antibodies are understood to include monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antibodies, antibody fragments (e.g., Fab and F(ab')<sub>2</sub>), chimeric antibodies bifunctional or bispecific antibodies and tetrameric antibody complexes. Antibodies are understood to be reactive against a selected antigen if they bind with an appropriate affinity (association constant), e.g. greater than or equal to 10<sup>7</sup>M<sup>\"1</sup>. Additionally, antibodies that may be used in the methods of the present invention may also be described or specified in terms of their binding affinities include those with a dissociation constant or Kd less than 5x10<sup>\"2</sup> M, 10<sup>\"2</sup> M, 5x10<sup>\"3</sup> M, 10<sup>\"3</sup> M, 5x10<sup>\"4</sup> M, 10<sup>\"4</sup> M, 5x10<sup>\"5</sup> M, 10<sup>\"5</sup> M, 5x10<sup>\"6</sup> M, 10<sup>\"</sup> <sup> 6</sup>M, 5x10<sup>\"7</sup> M, 10<sup>\"7</sup> M, 5x10<sup>\"8</sup> M, 10<sup>\"8</sup> M, 5x10<sup>\"9</sup> M, 10<sup>\"9</sup> M, 5x10<sup>\"10</sup> M, 10<sup>\"9</sup> M, 5x10<sup>\"11</sup> M, 10<sup>\"11</sup> M, 5x10<sup>\"12</sup> M, 10<sup>\"12</sup> M, 5x10<sup>\"13</sup> M, 10<sup>\"13</sup> M, 5x10<sup>\"14</sup> M, 10<sup>\"14</sup> M, 5x10<sup>\"15</sup> M, 10<sup>\"15</sup> M. </p> [0033] The term \"variable\" refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) or hypervariable regions both in the light-chain \n\n and the heavy-chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework (FR). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions, largely adopting a \u03b2-sheet configuration, connected by three CDRs, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the \u03b2-sheet structure. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity"
