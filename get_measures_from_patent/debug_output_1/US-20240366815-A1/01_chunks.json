    "PVH00010, Millipore). Membranes were blocked in 5% milk in TBST for 90 minutes before being placed in a primary antibody solution. Primary antibodies used were CDCP1 (4115, Cell Signaling, 1:1000), PSMA (12815, Cell Signaling, 1:1000), and B-Actin (A5441, Sigma-Aldrich, 1:5000). Membranes were then washed and incubated with a secondary antibody solution for 30 min at room temperature. Secondary antibodies used were goat anti-rabbit (65-6120, Invitrogen, 1:5000) and goat anti-rat (62-6520, Invitrogen, 1:5000). Proteins were detected using West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate for 20 seconds (34578, ThermoFisher Scientific) and then exposed to film (30-507, Blue Devil). Each immunoblot was reproduced at least once with freshly harvested protein samples.</p>Saturation binding assays. To prepare <sup>125</sup>I-4A06, 6.0 \u03bcL of <sup>125</sup>I in 1M NaOH (\u02dc340 uCi) was added into a vial containing 100.0 \u03bcL of HEPES buffer (0.5 M). This solution was transferred to an iodination tube (Peirce) and 4A06 antibody (300 \u03bcg) was then added. The tube was incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and ITLC showed 85.0% radiolabeling efficiency (solvent: 20 nM citric acid). <sup>125</sup>I-4A06 was purified using a G-25 column. The final yield of the purified <sup>125</sup>I-4A06 was 68.58% (specific activity=1.13 \u03bcCi/\u03bcg) and purity was &gt;99%.</p>DU145 and PC3 (0.6\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>cell/well) were seeded on 12-well plates using DMEM (10% FBS). The cells were washed with PBS for the saturation binding assay. Total binding of <sup>125</sup>I-4A06 was determined by adding it to cell suspensions at seven concentrations from 0.025 nM to 10 nM. Non-specific binding was determined by adding 1000\u00d7 cold 4A06 to <sup>125</sup>I-4A06/cell mixtures at 0.025 nM, 0.3 nM, and 10 nM. In all cases, cells were incubated with <sup>125</sup>I-4A06 at room temperature for 1 hr, washed with PBS, and lysed by adding 1.0 M NaOH. The bound and unbound radioactive fractions were collected and measured on a Hidex Gamma counter (Turku, FI). Bmax was calculated using Prism v8.0.</p>Animal studies. All animal studies, including housing and welfare monitoring, were conducted in compliance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at UCSF. Animal imaging studies involving patient derived xenografts (PDX) utilized eight to ten week old intact male NOD SCID gamma (NSG) mice from Charles River Laboratory. PDX lines were obtained from the Living Tumor Lab at the Vancouver Prostate Centre. For tumor imaging or treatment studies with mCRPC xenografts from cell line implants, four to six-week-old intact male athymic nu/nu mice (Charles River) were utilized. Mice were inoculated subcutaneously (\u02dc1.5\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>cells) in the flank with a slurry of cells in 1:1 mixture (v/v) of media (DMEM) and Matrigel (Corning). Xenografts were generally palpable within 3-4 weeks after injection. Tumor bearing mice received \u02dc300 \u03bcCi of <sup>89</sup>Zr-406 or \u02dc300 \u03bcCi of <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA 11 for imaging stu"
