    " Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. (2000)\u3002</p>The present invention includes giving subject's pharmaceutical composition, and described pharmaceutical composition is included to combine PAR4 and suppress PAR4 and cut\nCut and/or the compound of signal transduction (referring herein to \" PAR4 antagonists \" or \" therapeutic compounds \").</p>The compound of present disclosure can with peroral dosage form such as tablet, capsule (each capsule contain sustained release or\nTime release formulation), pill, powder, granule, elixir, tincture, supensoid agent, syrup and emulsion gives.They can be with quiet\n(inject or be transfused) in arteries and veins, intraperitoneal, subcutaneously or intramuscularly mode is given, all well-known to the ordinarily skilled artisan using pharmaceutical field\nFormulation.They can individually give, but generally be given together with pharmaceutical carrier, and the selection of the pharmaceutical carrier is based on selected administration\nApproach and standard pharmaceutical practice.</p>The preferred dose of PAR4 antagonists is bioactivity dosage.Bioactivity dosage be suppress PAR4 cutting and/or\nSignal transduction and the dosage acted on anti-thrombosis.It is desirable that PAR4 antagonists, which have, reduces PAR4 activity less than not\nHandle control level at least 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100% or the ability more than 100%.\nPAR4 levels in blood platelet are measured by any method known in the art, including such as Receptor Binding Assay, blood platelet\nAggregation, platelet activation determination method (such as being expressed by FACS p- selectins), the egg for cutting using PAR4 sensitive antibodies\nThe white matter marking or elisa assay.Or PAR4 bioactivity is measured by evaluating the cell signalling triggered by PAR4\n(for example, calcium mobilization or other second messenger's determination methods).</p>In some embodiments, the therapeutically effective amount of PAR4 compounds is preferably about less than 100 mg/kg, 50 mg/\nKg, 10 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg or less than 1 mg/kg.In further preferred embodiment, the treatment of PAR4 compounds\nEffective dose is less than 5 mg/kg.In the most preferred embodiment, the therapeutically effective amount of PAR4 compounds is less than 1 mg/kg.Such as this\nKnown to art personnel, the change of effective dose depends on the use of method of administration and excipient.</p>The compound of the present invention can make by part using suitable intranasal vehicles or by cutaneous routes in intranasal form\nGiven with percutaneous skin patch.When being given in the form of transdermal delivery system, in whole dosage, dosage give by\nIt is certainly lasting, rather than interruption.</p>Compound generally mixed with suitable pharmaceutical diluents, excipient or carrier (collectively referred to herein as pharmaceutical carrier) to\nGive, its expection form according to administration and appropriately selected, i.e. oral tablet, capsule, elixir, syrup "
