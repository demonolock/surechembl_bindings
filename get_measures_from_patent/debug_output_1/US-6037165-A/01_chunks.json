    "d, and</p>b/ fragments originating from HIV-2 with the same cDNA.</p>Generelly, the HIV-2 antigens used in the comparative tests, the description of which follows, originate from the HIV-2 MIR strain deposited with the CNCM under no. I-502, and the DNA sequences derived from the genomic DNA of HIV-2 originate from the strain HIV-2 ROD deposited with the CNCM under no. I-352.</p>I--Antigens, in Particular Proteins and Glycoproteins</p>The virus initially cultured in HUT 78 was labelled metabolically with [<sup>35</sup> S]systeine and [<sup>35</sup> S]methionine, the infected cells being incubated in the presence of these radioactive amino acids in culture medium devoid of the corresponding unlabelled amino acid, for a period of 14 to 16 hours, especially according to the technique described in the paper designated as reference (21) in the bibliography presented at the end of the description, as regards the labelling with [<sup>35</sup> S]cysteine. The supernatant is then clarified and the virus then ultracentrifuged for one hour at 100.000 g on a cushion of 20% sucrose. The principal antigens of the virus separated by electrophoresis in a polyacrylamide gel (12.5%) under denaturing conditions (SDS), or in a gel composed of poly-acrylamide (10%)+bisacrylamide (0.13%) with SDS (0.1% final concentration). The following coloured markers are used as molecular weight references:</p>______________________________________                                    \nmyosin                 200 kd                                             \n  phosphorylase B 97.4 kd                                                 \n  BSA 68 kd                                                               \n  ovalbumin 43 kd                                                         \n  \u03b1-chymotrypsin 25.7 kd                                            \n  \u03b2-lactoglobulin 18.4 kd                                            \n  lysozyme 14.3 kd                                                        \n______________________________________                                    \n</pre></p>Other molecular weight markers were used in other experiments. This applies, in particular, to FIGS. 1a, 1b and 1c, which refer to other known molecular weight markers (under the letter M in these figures). The antigens are still more readily distinguished after immuno-precipitation (RIPA) or by immunoimprinting (Wastern blot), using the antibodies present in the patient's serum: their apparent molecular weights, determined by their apparent migrations, are very close to those of the HIV-1 antigens.</p>It is generally specified that, in the text which follows, the numbers which follow the designations \"p\" and/or \"gp\" correspond to the approximate molecular weights of the corresponding proteins and/or glycoproteins, divided by 1000. For example, p36 has a molecular weight of the order of 36.000. It is, however, understood that these molecular weight values can vary within a range which can reach 5%, 10% or even more, depending on the techniques used for the determination of these molecular weights.</p>Repetition of the experiments enabled the apparent molecular weights of the HIV-2 antigens to be determined more accurately. Thus, it was found that the molecular weights of the three core proteins, which had initially been assigned molecular weights of the order of 13.000, 18.000 and 25.000, respectively, in fact had apparent molecular weights closer to the following values: 12.000, 16.000 and 26.000, respectively. These proteins are hereinafter designated by the abbreviations p12, p16 and p26.</p>The same considerations apply to the existence of protein or glycoprotein bands whose apparent molecular weights were assessed at values which could range from 32.000 to 42.000-45.000. Repetition of the measurements finally enabled a band corresponding to an apparent molecular weight of 36.000 to be precisely defined. In the text which follows, this band is designated by the abbreviation p36. Another band at 42.000-45.000 (p42) is consistently observed also. One or other of p36 or p42 probably constitutes a transmembrane glycoprotein of the virus.</p>A major envelope glycoprotein having a molecular weight of the order of 130-140 kd is consistently observed: this glycoprotein is designated hereinafter by the term gp140.</p>It is appropriate to note that, in general, the molecular weights are assessed with an accuracy of \u00b15%, this accuracy even being capable of becoming a little lower for antigens of high molecular weight, as was fournd for gp140 (molecular weight of 140\u00b110%). This group of antigens (when they are labelled with [<sup>35</sup> ]cysteine is only faintly recognized, if at all, by sera of patients containing anti-HIV-1 antibodies in the detection systems used in the laboratory or by the use of tests employing HIV-1 lysates, such as those marketed by DIAGNOSTICS PASTEUR under the name \"ELAVIA\". Only the p26 protein was weakly immunoprecipitated by such sera. The envelope protein was not precipitated. The serum of the patient infected with the new virus (HIV-2) faintly recognizes a p34 protein of HIV-1. In the detection system used, the other HIV-1 proteins were not recognized.</p>In contrast, HIV-2 possesses some proteins which show some immunological relationship with comparable structural proteins or glycoproteins, separated under similar conditions from a retrovirus recently isolated from captive macaques of the rhesus species, whereas this immunological relationship tends to become obliterated for other proteins or glycoproteins. This latter retrovirus, which is presumed to be the etiological agent of AIDS in monkeys, was designated by the investigators who isolated it [bibliographic re",
    ", and the STLV-III virus isolates, on the other hand, to be differentiated biologically.</p>Employing the same techniques as those recorded above, it was found that it was also possible to obtain the following from STLV-III:</p>a principal p27 core protein, having a molecular weight of the order of 27 kilodaltons,</p>a major envelope glycoprotein, gp140,</p>a p32 protein, probably transmembrane, which is not observed in RIPA when the virus has been labelled beforehand with [<sup>35</sup> S]cysteine, but which can be observed in immuno-imprinting experiments (Western blots) in the form of broad bands.</p>The major envelope glycoprotein of HIV-2 has proved to be immunologically closer to the major envelope glycoprotein of STLV-III than to the major envelope glyco-protein of HIV-1.</p>These findings apply not only in respect of the molecular weights, 130-140 kilodaltons for the major glycopioteins of HIV-2 and STLV-III compared with approximately 110 for the major envelope glycoprotein of HIV-1, but also in respect of the immunological properties, since sera drawn from patients infected with HIV-2, and more especially antibodies formed against the HIV-2 gp140, recognize the STLV-III gp140 whereas, in comparable experiments, the same sera and the same antibodies to HIV-2 do not recognize the HIV-1 gp110. However, anti-hiv-2 do not recognize the HIV-1 gp110. However, anti-HIV-1 sera which have never reacted with the HIV-2 gp140s precipitate a [<sup>35</sup> S]cysteine-labelled 26 kd protein present in extracts of HIV-2.</p>The major core protein of HIV-2 appears to have an average molecular weight (approximately 26.000) intermediate between that of the HIV-1 p25 and the p27 of STLV-III.</p>These observations are derived from experiments carried out with viral extracts obtained from HIV-2 isolated from one of the abovementioned patients. Similar results have been obtained with viral extracts of HIV-2 isolated from the second patient.</p>Cells infected, respectively, with HIV-1, HIV-2 and STLV-III were incubated in a medium containing 200 \u03bcCi/ml of [<sup>35</sup> S]cysteine in a medium free from unlabelled cysteine for 16 hours. The clarified supernatants were centrifuged at 60.000 g for 90 minutes. The pellets were lysed in an RIPA buffer (1), immunoprecipitated with different sera and then subjected to electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel charged with sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS-PAGE).</p>The results observed are illustrated by FIGS. 1a, 1b and 1c.</p>FIG. 1a shows the observed results of immuno-precipitation between a viral extract of HIV-1 obtained from a CEM C1.13 cell line and the following sera, respectively:</p>anti-HIV-1-positive serum (band 1),</p>serum obtained from the first patient mentioned above (band 2),</p>serum of a healthy African carrier of anti-HIV-1 antibodies (band 3),</p>serum obtained from a macaque infected with STLV-III (band 4), and</p>serum of the second patient mentioned above (band 5).</p>In FIG. 1b, there are recorded the observed results of immunoprecipitation between the HIV-2 antigens obtained from the first patient, after prior culture with HUT-78 cells, and different sera, more especially the serum of the abovementioned first patient (band 1), the anti-HIV-1-positive serum (band 2), the serum of the macaque infected with STLV-III (band 3) and the serum of the abovementioned second patient (band 4).</p>Finally, FIG. 1c illustrates the observed results of immunoprecipitation between the antigens of an STLV-III isolate obtained from a macaque having a simian AIDS. The sera used, to which the bands 1 to 5 refer, are the same as those recorded above in relation to FIG. 1a.</p>M refers to the markers myosin (200 kd), galactosidase (130 kd), bovine serum albumin (69 kd), phosphorylase B (93 kd), ovalbumin (46 kd) and carbonic anhydrase (30 kd).</p>FIGS. 2a and 2b show comparative results for the electrophoretic mobilities of the proteins of HIV-1, HIV-2 and STLV-III.</p>FIG. 2a relates to the experiments carried out with extracts of virus labelled with [<sup>35</sup> S]\u03c8ysteine, after immunoprecipitation on SDS-PAGE. The different bands relate to the following virus extracts: virus obtained from patient 1 and immunoprecipitated by the serum originating from the same patient (band 1), extract of the same virus immunoprecipitated with a negative control serum originating from a person not carrying anti-HIV-1 or anti-HIV-2 antibodies (band2), extract of STLV-III virus immunoprecipitated with a serum originating from a macaque infected with STLV-III (band 3), immunoprecipitation observed between extracts of the same virus and a negative control serum (band 4), and extract of HIV-1 immunoprecipitated with the serum of a European patient infected with AIDS.</p>FIG. 1b shows the results obtained in Western blot (immuno-imprinting) experiments. Cell lysates originating from uninfected or infected HUT-78 cells were subjected to electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE, and then transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose filter before being reacted with the serum of the above-mentioned first patient (serum diluted 1/100). The nitrocellulose filter was then washed and the detection of the bound antibodies visualized with <sup>125</sup> I-labelled goat anti-human IgG.</p>The spots observed in bands 1, 2 and 3 relate, respectiv",
