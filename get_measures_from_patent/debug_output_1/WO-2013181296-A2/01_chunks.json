The assays were performed using methods adapted from by Reggio et al., J. Med. Chem. 47 :5177, 1998 (CB1 receptor assay) and Munro et al., Nature 365:61, 1993 (CB2 receptor assay). Briefly, human cannabinoid receptor protein bound to Chem-1 membrane was used in modified HEPES (pH 7.4) buffer. A 10 microgram ^g) aliquot of Chem-1 membrane, radioactively labeled [<sup>3</sup>H] CBl-ligand SR141716A (2 nanomolar (nM)) (CB1 receptor antagonist) and test extracts or positive control R(+)-WIN-55,212-2 (10 \u03bc\u039c) (CB1 receptor agonist) were incubated in Incubation Buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM CaC12, 0.2% BSA) for 90 minutes at 37\u00b0C. After incubation, the membranes were filtered and washed four times and then the filters were counted to determine amount of [<sup>3</sup>H] WIN- 55,212-2 specifically bound to the CBl-membrane. </p> Table 1 presents the CB 1 binding assay results from the OE and AEs obtained from different plant parts of Morus alba: root barks, fruits, leaves, stem barks and stem. The greatest inhibition of CBl-ligand binding activity was found in OE obtained from root barks with 91% inhibition at testing concentration of 100 \u03bcg/mL and 82% at testing concentration of 10 \u03bcg/mL. \n\n Table 1 Inhibition of CBl ligand binding activity by Extracts from </p> Various Morus alba Plant Parts </p> Plant Source Tested Extract Active Extract CB 1 Inhibition* </p>91% (100 \u03bcg/mL)</p>Morus alba (root barks) OE<sup>T</sup>, AE<sup>+</sup> OE </p> 82% (10 \u03bcg/mL)</p>Morus alba (fruits) EE \u2014 \u2014 </p> Morus alba (leaves) EE , OE, AE, ME+ - -</p>Morus alba (stem barks) AE \u2014 \u2014 </p> Morus alba (stems) ME \u2014 \u2014 </p> * Results are expressed as a percent inhibition relative to control radiolabeled SR141716A ligand. </p> ^ OE means ground plant material extracted with Methanol:Dichloromethane (1 : 1 volume ratio) as described in Example 1. </p> AE means OE extracted material that was air dried and extracted once with ultrapure water, filtered and freeze-dried to provide aqueous extract material as described in Example 1. </p> * EE means that the ground plant material was extracted with only ethanol. </p> ^ ME means that the ground plant material was extracted with only methanol. </p>These data show that organic extracts of Morus alba root bark contain moderately high levels of a component that block the binding of the labeled CBl-ligand to a human CBl receptor protein.

The common chemical components in those Moraceae and Fabaceae plants are Diels-Alder adducts of a chalcone and prenylphenyl moiety. The existence of Diels-Alder adducts of a chalcone and prenylphenyl moiety is detectable in different plant tissues, such as roots, stems, rhizomes or whole plants. </p>Table 2.

The separation was monitored using a broadband wavelength UV detector and the fractions were collected in a 96-deep-well plate at 1.9 mL/well using a Gilson fraction collector. The sample plate was dried under low vacuum and centrifugation and then the samples were dissolved with 1.5 mL dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) per well. A portion (100 \u03bc\u03af) was taken and combined (based on UV trace) for the CBl inhibition assay. Column fractions having significant CBl binding activity were retained for further testing. </p>EXAMPLE 4 </p> INHIBITION OF CBl ACTIVITY BY COMBINED HTP FRACTIONS FROM MORUS ALBA </p>Organic extract of Morus alba root bark from Example 3 was further investigated by examining the combined HTP fractions for inhibition of CBl binding activity by labeled CBl-ligand. The activity profile of combined HTP fractions indicates that more than one component in the fractionated Morus alba organic extract might contribute to the inhibition of CBl-ligand binding activity. </p> Table 3 presents the CB 1 binding assay results from the combined HTP fractions of Morus alba root bark extract. \n\n Table 3.

The gradients started with 95% Hexane/EtOAC for 5 minutes, then increased EtOAC from 5% to 100% over the duration of 25 minutes, and then held at 100% EtOAc for additional five minutes, before increasing MeOH from 0% to 50% MeOH/EtOAC over a next period of 15 minutes, finally changed the elution solution to 100% MeOH and eluted the column for another 16 minutes. The total run time was 66 minutes and 88 fractions were generated for each column. The fractions were analyzed by silica gel thin layer chromatography (TLC) and pooled together to generate eight column eluent pools. Each of the eight eluent pools was then tested using the CBl binding assay described in Example 2. The resulting CBl binding assay data are shown in Table 4. </p>Table 4 CBl activity by Silica Fraction Pools</p>Eluent Pool Number % CBl Binding Activity Inhibition </p> 1 -43% </p> 2 -36% </p> 3 -5% \n\n Eluent Pool Number % CB1 Binding Activity Inhibition </p> 4 64% </p> 5 71% </p> 6 29% </p> 7 29% </p> 8 35% </p>These data show that the highest level of inhibition of CBl-ligand binding was in pool 4 (containing 1.4 g of material) and pool 5 (1.7 g of material) when tested in the CB1 binding assay at a concentration of 20 \u03bcg/mL. </p> The resulting best active best pool (containing 300 mg of material) was fractionated on a preparative C 18 column (30 cm x 250 cm) with a gradient mobile phase of water (A) and methanol (B) over 60 minutes at a flow rate of 20 mL/minute to generate 22 fraction pools.
