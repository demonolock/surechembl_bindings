Compounds of formula VII in which G<sub>1</sub>-G<sub>2</sub>-G<sub>3</sub> are\nother than -NH-CH=CH- may be prepared by methods analogous to that disclosed in\nthe above reference by selecting the appropriate starting materials.</p>Compounds of formula I in which HET is 2-amino-3-pyridyl may be prepared by\nthe reaction of the corresponding compound of formula I in which HET is 2-chloro-3-pyridyl\nwith aqueous ammonia solution.</p>The ability of compounds of formula I to interact with 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)\nreceptors has been demonstrated by the following test which determines the \nability of the compounds to inhibit tritiated ligand binding to 5-HT receptors in vitro and\nin particular to 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors.</p>Hippocampal tissue from the brains of male Charles River CD rats weighing\nbetween 150-250 g were homogenised in ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.7)\nwhen measured at 25\u00b0C, 1:40 w/v) and centrifuged at 30,000 g at 4\u00b0C for 10 minutes.\nThe pellet was rehomogenised in the same buffer, incubated at 37\u00b0C for 10 minutes\nand centrifuged at 30,000 g at 4\u00b0C for 10 minutes. The final pellet was resuspended\nin 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.7) containing 4 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1% L-ascorbic acid and\n10 \u00b5M pargyline hydrochloride (equivalent to 6.25 mg wet weight of tissue/ml) and\nused immediately in the binding assay. Aliquots (400 \u00b5l; equivalent to 2.5 mg wet\nweight of tissue/tube) of this suspension were added to tubes containing the ligand (50\n\u00b5l; 2 nM) and distilled water (50 \u00b5l; total binding) or 5-HT (50 \u00b5l; 10 \u00b5M; non-specific\nbinding) or test compound (50 \u00b5l; at a single concentration of 10<sup>-6</sup> M or at 10\nconcentrations ranging from 10<sup>-11</sup>-10<sup>-3</sup> M). The ligand was [<sup>3</sup>H]8-hydroxy-2-(dipropylamino)tetralin\n([<sup>3</sup>H]8-OH-DPAT) and the mixture was incubated at 25\u00b0C for 30\nminutes before the incubation was terminated by rapid filtration.</p>The filters were washed with ice-cold Tris-HCl buffer and dried. The filters\nwere punched out into vials, scintillation fluid added and radioactivity determined by\nliquid scintillation counting. The percentage displacement of specific binding of the\ntritiated ligand was calculated for the single concentration (10<sup>-6</sup> M) of test compound.\nDisplacement curves were then produced for those compounds which displaced \u226550%\nof specific binding of the tritiated ligand at 10<sup>-6</sup> M using a range of concentrations of\nthe compound. The concentration which gave 50% inhibition of specific binding (IC<sub>50</sub>)\nwas obtained from the curve. The inhibition coefficient Ki was then calculated using\nthe formula\nKi = IC501+([ligand]/KD)\nin which [ligand] is the concentration of the tritiated ligand used and K<sub>D</sub> is the\nequilibrium dissociation constant for the ligand. </p>The ability of compounds of formula I to interact with adrenoceptor binding\nsites has been demonstrated by the following test which determines the ability of the\ncompounds to inhibit tritiated ligand binding to adrenoceptors in vitro and in particular\n\u03b1<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors.</p>Whole cortical tissue from the brains of male Charles River CD rats weighing\nbetween 150-250 g were homogenised in ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6 (at 25\u00b0C;\n1:40 w/v) and centrifuged at 1000 g at 4\u00b0C for 10 minutes. The supernatant was\ncentrifuged at 30,000 g at 4\u00b0C for 10 minutes. The pellet was rehomogenised in\n50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6 (1:40 w/v) and centrifuged at 30,000 g at 4\u00b0C for 10 minutes.\nThe final pellet was resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6 (equivalent to 12.5 mg\nwet weight of tissue/ml) and used immediately in the binding assay. Aliquots (400 \u00b5l;\nequivalent to 5 mg wet weight of tissue/tube) of this suspension were added to tubes\ncontaining the ligand (50 \u00b5l; 0.1 nM) and distilled water (50 \u00b5l; total binding) or\nphentolamine (50 \u00b5l; 5 \u00b5M; non-specific binding) or test compound (50 \u00b5l; at a single\nconcentration of 10<sup>-6</sup>M or at 10 concentrations ranging from 10<sup>-11</sup> - 10<sup>-3</sup>M). The ligand\nwas [7-methoxy-<sup>3</sup>H]prazosin and the mixture was incubated at 30\u00b0C for 30 minutes\nbefore the incubation was terminated by rapid filtration.</p>The filters were washed with ice-cold Tris-HCl buffer and dried.

The pellet was\nresuspended in Tris salts buffer ( 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer containing 120 mM NaCl, 5\nmM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> with the addition of 6 mM ascorbic acid; pH\n7.7 when measured at 25\u00b0C), and again centrifuged at 40,000 g for 10 minutes.

The filters\nwere punched out in to vials, scintillation fluid added and were left for about 20 hours\nbefore being counted by scintillation spectrophotometry. The percentage\ndisplacement of specific binding of the tritiated ligand was calculated for the single\nconcentration (10<sup>-6</sup>M) of test compound.

A solution of (R)-glycidyl 4-toluenesulphonate (1.47 g) in dry\ndimethylformamide (30 ml) was then added and the mixture stirred at ambient\ntemperature for 10 minutes, then at 60\u00b0C for 3 hours. The mixture was poured into\nwater (400 ml) and extracted with ethyl acetate (3x200 ml). The combined extracts \nwere washed with brine (6x200 ml), dried over magnesium sulphate and the solvent\nevaporated under reduced pressure. The brown solid residue was purified by flash\ncolumn chromatography on silica eluting with a 1:1 mixture of petroleum ether "
