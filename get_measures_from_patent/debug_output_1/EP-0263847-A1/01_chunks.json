    "unbound Protein A and exposed to X-ray film for autoradiography. Each radioactive band represents the location of a protein species which formed an immune complex with antibodies from the test sera.</p>1(e) Patients, treatments and antibody responses: Evaluation of independent serum samples from certain patients. Immunoblots were performed using pre-immune sera and serum samples (post-immune sera) obtained at various times after the initiation of immunotherapy and at a time when tumor regression was noticeable and post-immune sera from three different patients including the previously described patients. All patients underwent intralymphatic immunotherapy using cell lines established from their own tumors and other cultured cells established from related tumors from other patients. Antigens having molecular \n\nweights of approximately 70,000 daltons and 43,000 daltons were readily detected in protein preparations from malignant cells of ovarian origin using the post-immune sera from these three patients while no significant immunoreactivity was observed with the pre-immune sera from the same patients. The post-immune sera of these patients did not react with antigenic species in various normal human tissue or cultured cell extracts including those from normal breast and ovary. Results of immunoblot studies using post-immune sera and ascites fluid from patient A (ovarian cancer) indicated the presence of comparable antibodies in both as detected by their reactivities with a 70 kd antigen band and with two antigen bands of 38 kd to 40 kd and 43 kd to 45 kd present in several different ovarian and non-ovarian tumor cell lines. FIG. 1 presents immunoblots using 1:1000 sera dilutions from 2 immunized patients (Pt-1 and Pt-2) and a rabbit (#209) immunized with the particulate fraction obtained from A375 (ING-A) cells; all sera were tested against the particulate fraction (lanes labeled 1) or conditioned medium (lanes labeled 2) from A375-ING-A cells. The patterns of immune complex formation in this test represent what is typically observed with sera from patients regressing tumors. It was also evident from the immunoblot data that the antigen species preliminarily identified to be of about 43 kd included at least two entities with molecular weights of 38 kd to 40 kd (the \"38 kd\" antigen) and 43 kd to 45 kd (the \"43 kd\" antigen) being resolved by SDS-PAGE system of higher resolving power. Both of these antigenic species appear to be significantly different from the major histocompatibility. antigens (HLA-ABC) in that their mobilities in reducing SDS-PAGE were unaffected by treatment with endoglycosidases H and F under conditions where the carbohydrate moieties of HLA-ABC is degraded by these enzymes (as visualized by immunoblots of these antigens using monoclonal antibodies specific for HLA- \n\nABC to locate antigen bands). The 70 kd, 43 kd and 38 kd antigens are all also distinguishable from HLA-ABC in two dimensional gel electrophoresis.</p>A patient with metastatic prostatic cancer who received intralymphatic infusions of two irradiated cultured cells established from two independent prostatic cancers, SRO84-1 and HRO84-1, developed antibodies reactive with the 38 kd and the 43 kd antigens in the primary cell suspension of prostate tumors from which the HR084-1 cell line was derived; these antigens also were detected in SRO84-1 cultured cells. Associated with this patient's immunotherapy were dramatic declines in serum acid phosphatase levels measured during the first two weeks following initiation of the immunizations. The 43 kd and the 70 kd antigen species also were detected in certain fresh tumor extracts by the post-immune sera from several patients. The test extracts used in these studies were obtained from a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and a breast carcinoma. Sera samples from a metastatic renal cancer patient were obtained before and after intralymphatic immunizations with a mixture of allogeneic renal cancer cell lines. Pre-immune serum from this patient showed negligible reactivity in the 43 kd antigen region with either of the two extracts tested; in contrast, the post-immune sera from this patient reacted with a specific 43 kd band in the lymphoma extract. In addition, a dog immunized with a human squamous cell carcinoma culture (69-2), also developed antibodies which reacted with specific antigens in the 68 kd to 70 kd range from a human Kaposi's sarcoma extract. The pre-immune sera from the patient and the dog were not reactive with the Kaposi's sarcoma extract.</p>Using techniques essentially as described above, antibodies in sera samples obtained from a large number of tumor-regressing patients have detected one or more of the three major molecular groups of RAAs with apparent molecular weights of about 68,000 daltons, about 43,000 daltons (also \n\nsee below) and about 20,000 daltons in various tumor cells including tumor cell preparations used for immunization. Antibodies in sera collected prior to the initiation of immunotherapy failed to detect any of these three RAAs. In order to further characterize these novel antigens, cell particulate fractions from human tumor cells have been used as the starting material to partially purify them. After extraction of the ING-A variant of A375 melanoma cells, ammonium sulfate fractionation and enrichment using affinity chromatography with RAAbs bound to sepharose, the 38 kd, 43 kd and 70 kd antigens were found to co-elute in an acetonitrile gradient using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). FIG. 2 illustrates the elution of these antigenic species as a major peak from a C-8 reverse phase HPLC column (this peak is labeled number 6 and an immunoblot analysis of antigen species in pools 1 to 9 is shown below the column profile wherein corresponding lanes are numbered to indicate correspondence to the numbered HPLC pools). The approximate sizes of the RAAs have been estimated solely based upon the mobility, in reducing SDS- PAGE, of each of the detected RAAs relative to commercially available, pre-stained molecular weight size markers, Midrange Kit, purchased from Bethesda Research Laboratories, Inc., Bethesda, Maryland, or Diversified Biotech, Newton Centre, Massachusetts. One RAA with an assigned molecular weight of 68,000 daltons (68 kd) migrates within a size range of between 65 to 71 thousand daltons. Another RAA consists of either a single protein band of approximately 43,000 daltons (43 kd) in size within a range of between 41 to 45 thousand daltons, or frequently consists of a doublet having two detectable bands visualized on an immunoblot. The third species is an antigen of approximately 20,000 dalton molecular weight (20 kd) within a range of between 19 to 23 thousand daltons.</p>RAAs usually have been detected in 10 to 20 ug \n\ntotal protein preparations obtained from human tumor tissue and cell extracts using between 200- and 2000-fold dilutions of sera from patients regressing a variety of human malignancies including ovarian carcinoma, thyroid cancer, malignant melanoma, prostate cancer, epidermoid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma and certain others.</p>Table 1 summarizes results obtained with sera from five patients showing evaluable regression of the indicated metastatic cancers following intralymphatic immunotherapy. A serum sample obtained from each of the five patients (during regression) was used to perform immunoblotting studies on one or more tumor tissue extracts (designated by letter symbols) or extracts of established and primary cell cultures derived from various human tumors. The samples tested by each patient's serum sample are listed under the respective patient number. Some of the primary cell suspensions or established cultured cells have been used for intralymphatic immunotherapy and thus their abilities to induce tumor regression have been tested. These results are summarized in the second column as ILI status identified as follows: Rg+, indicating that the cell lines elicited tumor regression in ILI patients, Rg- indicating that the cell lines failed to elicit tumor regression in ILI patients, or NT indicating that the cell lines were not tested. For each of the three RAA species discussed in this table, a \"+\" indicates an easily detected signal in a standard immunoblot assay with the serum antibodies reacting with antigens present in 20 micrograms or less of total cellular proteins; a dilution of 200-fold or more of the sera from the indicated patient was used in all these studies. In Table 1, patient #1 had malignant melanoma, #2 had ovarian carcinoma, #3 had squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, #4 had prostate carcinoma and #5 had thyroid carcinoma. \n\n Table 1</p>DISTRIBUTION OF RAAs IN TUMOR CELL LINES</p>Ability to</p>Cell line or Induce 43 kd 68 kd 20 kd tumor extract Regression RAA RAA RAA</p>PATIENT#1 extract F NT + + -</p>M14 Rg+ + - -</p>69-12 Rg- - - -</p>A375 Rg+ + + +</p>PATIENT #2 extract 0 NT - + -</p>69-1 Rg+ + + -</p>69-3 Rg+ + + -</p>69-11 Rg- - + -</p>FRO81-2 Rg+ + - -</p>A375 Rg+ + + +</p>PATIENT#3 extract L NT - + -</p>69-2 Rg+ + + -</p>69-13 Rg+ - + -</p>SRO82-3 NT - + -</p>PATIENT#4 extract P NT + + -</p>SRO84-1 Rg+ + + -</p>PATIENT #5 (cancer)</p>ARO81-1 Rg+ + - -</p>DRO82-1 Rg+ + - - \n\n In all of the patients presented in Table 1, immunoblotting analysis carried out with pre-immunotherapy sera failed to detect the presence of antibodies reacting with any of the respective RAAs. In several other cases evaluated, with the exception of two patients with malignant melanomas, the results of immunoblotting analysis carried out with pre-immunotherapy serum failed to reveal radioactive bands at about 68 kd, at about 43 kd or at about 20 kd, suggesting that most cancer patients prior to therapy do not contain antibodies against the RAAs of this invention. The detection of antibodies against the 38 kd and the 43 kd RAAs in the two melanoma patients prior to treatment with intralymphatic immunotherapy may be indicative of the known ability of melanomas to occasionally undergo spontaneous regression and to mediate such regression through the patients ability to generate such antibodies without active immunization. The molecular mass determinations for the RAAs identified in Table 1 were made using \"mini\" SDS-PAGE in which 10% SDS-polyacrylamide resolving gels having a height of 7.5 cm are employed. When the \"mini\" SDS-PAGE was calibrated with molecular mass standards, the estimated principle sizes of the RAAs were of 68,000 daltons, 43,000 daltons and 20,000 daltons, although the doublet near 43,000 daltons was often not well-resolved in these gels. More precise molecular mass estimates have been obtained using the higher resolving power of a longer [14 cm] 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (as are employed in Fig. 1). Such gels calibrated with midrange molecular weight markers of molecular wights between 12 kd and 95 kd have indicated the molecular mass estimate to be 70,000 daltons rather than 68,000 daltons for the larger RAA and also has clearly resolved the 43,000 dalton doublet into two species: 43,000 daltons (43 kd) and 38,000 daltons (38 kd) . Through the use \n\nof the higher resolving SDS-PAGE, the 43 kd RAA identified in Table 1 for patients No. 1, 2 and 4 was shown to contain large amounts of the 38 kd RAA.</p>In additional studies of patients subjected to immunotherapy but in whom no clinical responses were observed (i.e., in whom progression of the malignant condition continued as judged by clinical criteria including radiological analysis or direct physical examination), the results were analogous to those obtained using sera from patients prior to immunotherapy. Sera from many non-responding patients with several different types of malignancies were evaluated at different times after initiating intralymphatic immunotherapy and all of these failed to react with any of the aforementioned RAAs in extracts of tumor tissues and tumor cell lines tested.</p>The simple method of immunoblotting using serum samples from patients on extracts of tumor cells which contain RAAs as demonstrated by experimental results of this invention allows one to monitor the success of an immunotherapy protocol with regard to specific immune response to tumor cell-associated antigens. The monitoring may be accomplished by examining RAAb titer(s) (defined as the maximal serum dilution able to detect RAAs in a standard immunoblot procedure as described below) and RAAb specificities (defined as the apparent molecular masses of the specific antigens recognized by the serum samples) .</p>Antibodies against tumor cell-associated components developed in patients immunized by the intralymphatic route with irradiated human tumor cell lines. These antibodies may be useful in the characterization of appropriate tumor cells or subcellular components for active specific immunotherapy of various cancers and were identified as follows.</p>1(f) Screening of antibody response in a large number of patients. More than fifty cancer patients were treated with a mixture of autologous human tumor cells and \n\nallogeneic human tumor cell lines by intralymphatic administration according to procedures described above. In Table 2, is a detailed presentation of patients with regard to the type of cancer, the cell lines administered, the antigens detected by their sera after immunotherapy and their clinical outcome. Cellular antigens observed in a substantial number of patients who underwent immunotherapy included membrane antigens of molecular weight 70 kd, 43 kd and 38 kd using the higher resolving SDS-PAGE for molecular weight assignment. A few other antigens with various sites of cellular localization have been noted in isolated cases and have been listed in Table 2.</p>In Table 2, + = remission, 0 = stable, - = progression and ? = unknown. Delayed hypersenitivity skin tests were evaluated 24 and 48 hours after intradermal injection of 10<sup>5</sup> irradiated tumor cells: S = small (5-10 mm diameter of induration and erythema), M = medium (10-25 mm diameter of induration and erythema) and N = negative. Tumor designations are the following: ov = ovarian, Sq = squamous cell, ENT = head and neck, pan = pancreas, AdLu = adeno carcinoma of lung, mel = melanoma, thy = thyroid. Antigens are indicated by the number corresponding to their size in kilodaltons. Where the letter \"c\" follows the antigen number the antigen identified was cytoplasmic in localization (e.g., 70c). Where the letter \"n\" follows, the antigen number, the antigen identified was nuclear in localization (e.g., 43 n) . Where the number alone is listed (e.g. 43), the antigen is localized in the tumor cell membrane. \"Cell lines\" are human tumor cell lines used for immunization. The cell lines are designated with letter and number codes and cell suspensions prepared from fresh antologous tumor biopsies are designated RTH alone or RTH followed by a number indicates the clinical response could not be evaluated. A small number of patients show reactivity with a 68 kd antigen in addition to reacting with the 70 kd species. This 68 kd species has not yet been \n\ndirectly associated with tumor regression. \n\n</p>Table 2</p>Summary of Clinical and Immune Response</p>Of Patients as Grouped by a Cell Line Which</p>Was Common Among Those Used for Immunization</p>69-2</p>Patient Tumor Cell Lines Antigens Response Skin Test</p>32 ov 69-2 69-11T3 MCF-5 69-1 38, 43, 70 0</p>21 Sq 69-2 CAL-33 38, 43, 70 0</p>23 Sq 69-2 A375 38, 43, 70 0</p>56 Sq 69-2 100P3 Ca127 RTH 70c - S</p>28 Sq 69-2 - S</p>14 ENT 69-2 CAL-27 100P3 ? ?</p>15 ENT 69-2 CAL-27 100P3 68, 70 ?</p>16 ENT 69-2 CAL-27 100P3 43 ?</p>17 LUNG 69-2 CR081-6 100P3 CRO-81-8 -</p>18 Gast 69-2 A375 RTH1719 - M</p>20 Brea 69-2 A375 RTH964 38, 43, 70 +</p>40 Lung 69-2 RTH 1717 A375 ? \n\n</p></p>A375</p>Patient Tumor Cell Lines Antigens Response Skin Test</p>22 Sq A375 MRO81-1 MRO84-1 38, 43, 70, 43c 0 M</p>23 Sq A375 69-2 38, 43, 70 0</p>1 Mel A375 CRO81-5 38, 43 + S</p>2 Mel A375 CRO81-5 M14 WR081-1 18, 41, 43, 70 + S</p>29 Thy A375 DRO81-1 WR082-1 RTH1722 38, 43, 70 - M</p>10 Mel A375 CRO81-5 Rth 38, 43, 70 0 S</p>18 Gast A375 69-2 RTH1719 M</p>20 Brea A375 69-2 RTH964 38, 43, 70 +</p>40 Lung A375 RTH 1717 69-2 ?</p>46 Lung A375 WO 69-2 ?</p>19 Pan A375 69-2 RRO81-4 S</p>58 Mel A375 CRO81-5 RTH S \n\n</p></p></p></p>As shown in Table 2, the majority of the patients who had progression of their tumors failed to elicit an antibody response to the 38 kd, 43 kd, and 70 kd antigens present primarily in extracts of A375 melanoma cells and 69-2 cells (squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagous).</p>In a typical immune response after intralymphatic immunotherapy (ILI), tumor cell-associated antigens having molecular weights of approximately 70 kd and 43 kd were readily detected in malignant cells of ovarian origin using the post-immune sera from patients numbered 23 and 52 in Table 2. No significant immunoreactivity was observed with the preimmune sera from the same patients. These antigens were present in the particulate fraction of A375 cell lysates as assessed by Western immunoblots.</p>The majority of the patients showing evaluable response developed antibodies to particulate-associated antigens having molecular masses of 38 kd, 43 kd and 70 kd. In several cases, however, the positive clinical response could not be correlated with the appearance of these antibodies.</p>As shown in Table 2, eight of twelve patients treated with A375 cells along with other cells responded to the therapy. The tumors progressed in two patients, and in two others, the clinical response could not be ascertained. Of the eight positive responders, seven developed antibodies to the particulate antigens having molecular weights of about 38 kd, 43 kd, and 70 kd. None of the non-responders or the ones of questionable status developed any antibodies to the membrane antigens.</p>Fifteen patients were treated with 69-2 cells along with other cells. Of these, only five showed a positive clinical response, five did not respond to the therapy, and in the remaining five patients the clinical \n\nstatus could not be ascertained. Four of the five positive responders had developed antibodies to membrane antigens 38 kd, 43 kd, and 70 kd. The majority of the other patients did not develop antibodies to the membrane antigens.</p>1(g) Antibody response and clinical outcome. Determination of specificities and titers of RAAbs from over 50 patients undergoing intralymphatic immunotherapy have served to monitor the correlation between the development of antibodies to one or more of the RAA's of this invention and tumor regression or stabilization.</p>Tables 3 and 4 summarize the data which indicate an association of elevated RAAbs (anti-regressen antibodies) with clinically evaluable regression or stabilization in the patients described in Table 2. \n\n</p></p>1(h) Identification of RAAbs in melanoma patients immunized subcutaneously with melanoma cell lysates. Two cell cultures derived from melanoma tissues of two individual female patients were combined after a final passage for 4 days in serum-free medium. A mechanical lysate was prepared with a Potter-Elvejhem homogenizer at 4\u00b0C and the lysate was diluted to a known concentration of tumor cell equivalents (i.e., an amount of lysate corresponding to the number of intact cells present prior to cell lysis, generally 10<sup>7</sup> to 10<sup>8</sup> cell equivalents per milliliter).</p>A first batch of lysate vaccine was called MAC-1 and used to treat an initial 8 patients with widespread melanoma. Based upon results of certain tests, MAC-1 cells may have been contaminated with Mycoplasma hyorhinis. Another batch, prepared in a very similar way with later passages of the cultured melanoma cells was called MAC-3 and used to treat the remaining patients in the study. MAC-3 cells do not appear to have been contaminated with Mycoplasma hyorhinis. The melanoma cell lysates were administered subcutaneously to patients along with an experimental adjuvant called DETOX\u2122 (a detoxified fraction mycobacteria consisting principally of monophosphoryl lipid A, supplied by Ribi Immunochem Research, Inc., Hamilton, Montana). The adjuvant is known to have immune-stimulating activity and, therefore, the clinical response observed in melanoma patients may be due, at least in part, to an adjuvant effect (non-specific) in addition to the active immunization process.</p>Immunoblot studies were conducted using the post-immune sera from patients treated with MAC-1 (patients #1 to 8 the results are presented in Table 5) and MAC-3 (patients #9 to 15) to screen three different antigen preparation. The molecular masses in kilodaltons of the antigens detected by each patient \n\nsera are indicated under each extract. Clinical responses are indicated by : + = extensive regression, 0 = stabilization or partial regression, - = progression, and ? = not able to be evaluated. \n\n</p></p>As indicated in the above Table 5, six out of eight patients receiving MAC-1 developed antibodies primarily to 38 kd, 43 kd and 70 kd RAAs and two of these patients showed tumor regression. An additional patient (#5) showed regression when he was subsequently treated with interleukin 2. None of the patients immunized with MAC-3 developed antibodies reactive with any of the RAAs except for faint reactivities seen by patients # 10 and #11 to single antigen bands; it should be noted that such weak reactivities were also detectable with sera from these patients prior to their immunizations. The positive clinical responses seen in a few patients treated with MAC-3 may have been caused by the adjuvant since the responses were generally observed within days or weeks after immunotherapy was initiated, a time earlier than that usually required for the development of specific RAAbs.</p>FIG. 3 illustrates the results of three immunoblots in which RAAbs from three different ILI patients (selected from responders in Table 2) were allowed to react with antigens in MAC-1 or MAC-3 extracts. The major reactivity observed with each antiserum was with 38 kd and 43 kd RAAs in MAC-1 alone. Molecular weight (MW) markers on the left were used for the Western blot with antiserum A. The two</p>Western blots (MAC-3, MAC-1) with antisera B and C have as MW references those on the right side (near C) .</p>These results may be compared with FIG. 1 in which the reactivity of antibodies in post-immune sera from Patient No. 2 with the 43 kd, 38 kd and 70 kd RAAs from ING-A cells is illustrated. This patient responded clinically to subcutaneous immunizations with the MAC-1 lysate preparation.</p>When the ING-A cell lysate is prepared according to the protocol used for preparing MAC-1 lysate, RAAs are localized in the insoluble fraction \n\nobtained as a pellet by centrifugation at 10,000 X g for 15 minutes. The soluble supernatant is free of RAAs as assessed by immunoblot analysis.</p>Example 2</p>Characterization of RAAs</p>2(a) Size on SDS-polyacrylamidge gel electrophoresis . The specific RAAs of this invention are distinguishable from one another and also from other antigens associated with tumors and cells derived from tumors based upon their sizes and immunological properties. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is much larger than any of the RAAs, as are several of the antigenic determinants which may be identified with existing murine monoclonal antibodies. Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) consists of two subunits both of which are distinguishable from the RAAs described in a reducing SDS-PAGE system (the \u00f8 subunit of HCG is 35 kd in size and its \u03b1 subunit is 16 kd in size [Pierce et al., Ann. Rev. Biochem. , 50, 465-495 (1981)]).</p>There is a rapidly growing list of tumor- specific antigens identified with murine monoclonal antibodies. The available information distinguishes these antigens from RAAs of this invention on the basis of size or relatedness to normal cellular constituents (Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Reisfeld et al., eds., supra). Monoclonal antibodies have lead to the detection of a 92 kd, a 23 kd, and a 17 kd antigens in urinary bladder cancer, Ben-Aissa et al., Br . J. Cancer, 52, 65-72 (1985). However, these monoclonals do not react with melanoma cells (the principal source of the 19 kd to 23 kd RAA described herein). A monoclonal antibody specific for a 43 kd surface protein of human leukemia cell line (THP-1) \n\ncross-reacts with the intermediate filament vimentin found in normal cells. Herman et al., J. Cell Sci. , 73, 87-103 (1985). A 52 kd protein is released by human breast cancer cells [Capony et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 108, 8-15 (1982)], and a high molecular weight glycoprotein (220 kd to 400 kd) as well as a 90 kd protein are found in membranes of human breast cancer [Schlom et al., Cancer, 54, 2777-2794 (1984)]. A sarcoma-specific 70 kd antigen appears to be different from the 68 kd to 70 kd RAA of this invention in that the sarcoma 70 kd antigen was not detectable in carcinoma cell lines [Feit et al.. Cancer Res., 44, 5752-5756, (1984)].</p>Metabolic labeling of ING-A (A375) cells with <sup>35</sup>S-methionine. A375 cells were grown in 100 mm petri dishes to 70% confluency and were incubated with 10 ml of serum-free RPMI medium followed by fresh methionine-deficient media containing 3 \u03bcl of <sup>35</sup>S-methionine (1148 Ci/nmol, 1 mCi/0.077 ml) (NEN Research Products, Boston, Massachusetts). Both cells and media were harvested at 1, 2, 4.5, 22 and 28 hours after exposure to <sup>35</sup>S-methionine.</p>Antigens were immunoprecipitated by treating <sup>35</sup>S-methione-labelled extracts of A375 cells with protein-A sepharose-bound IgG from a responding patient. The antigens were visualized by autoradiography following SDS-PAGE of immunoprecipitated antigens [according to the procedure of Sen et al., Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. (USA), 80, 1246-1250 (1983)]. Proteins immunoprecipitated from conditioned media and cell extracts by pre-immune IgG bound to protein-A Sepharose\u2122 served as controls. Numerous bands, including a doublet around 38 kd and 43 kd molecular weight, appeared in the immunoprecipitation lanes of cell extracts with RAAbs. In contrast, immunoprecipitation of the conditioned media using RAAbs \n\nshowed one band in the 38 kd region. The appearance of this band at 4.5 hours coincided with the appearance of a 38 kd protein species in the conditioned media at 4.5 hours. This experiment demonstrates that the 38 kd antigen is secreted by the A375-INGA cells.</p>2(b) Partial purification of RAAs from tumor cell extracts. Cell line A375 is a malignant melanoma cell line described by Todaro and colleagues. Giard et al., J. Nat. Cancer Inst., 51, 1417-1423 (1973). In a typical procedure for the isolation of RAAs, A375 cells growing in roller bottles may be washed and subsequently exposed to extraction buffers containing nonionic and ionic detergents as described above which detergents are capable of solublizing proteins from cell membranes or total cellular proteins. After high speed centrifugation (10,000 X g, 4\u00b0 C) the soluble supernatant is used for further purification using conventional chromotography steps as well as affinity chromatography (e.g., resins containing immobilized antibodies reactive with regression-associated antigens or lectins with high affinity for these antigens).</p>Approximately 10<sup>8</sup> A375 cells growing in roller bottles were rinsed twice with standard phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and then were extracted with a small volume (50 ml) of 0.2% Triton X-100<sup>\u00ae</sup> buffer for 5 min. at room temperature. The solution was removed and debris was pelleted by centrifugation (10,000 X g, 4\u00b0 C) . The supernatant containing RAAs was passed over an antibody affinity column containing immunoglobulins from patient #2 serum containg RAAb's purified on a</p>Zetachrom\u2122 membrane filter according to supplier's instructions (AMF Lab Products, Meriden, Connecticut). Ten milligrams of the immunoglobulins were coupled to an Affi-gel 10\u2122 resin according to the supplier's instructions (Bio-Rad, Richmond, California). The unbound proteins were washed with 0.02% Triton X-100<sup>\u00ae</sup>, \n\n25 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.5 and 0.1 M NaCl. The column was then washed with distilled water. The bound RAAs were eluted using 1 M NaCl, 0.1% NP40\u2122 (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Missouri), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% aprotinin. The eluant was dialyzed against 0.01 M ammonium bicarbonate, frozen and lyophilized.</p>The lyophilized powder was suspended in 0.05% trifluoracetic acid and 4 mg total protein was loaded onto a standard C-8 column for high performance liquid chromatography (Beckman Instruments). Elution was performed using a linear 0 to 100% acetonitrile gradient going from peak 1 (pass through) to peak 10. A sample from each peak was lyophilized and analyzed by immunoblotting using post-ILI serum (1:1000 dilution) from Patient #2 of Table 1. The Coomassie blue-stained SDS-PAGE revealed that greater than 40% of the detectable protein in peak 6 was in species having 43 kd and 70 kd sizes as shown in FIG. 2. The progress of purification was monitored using the immunoblotting technique to verify the location of specific 68 to 70 kd, 38 kd and 43 kd regression-associated antigens. The degree of purity of products is assessed by determination of protein concentration as well as comparison of total protein pattern in specific fractions containing RAA's with that of the starting material. The total protein patterns of different samples were monitored by staining the SDS-PAGE with Coomassie blue protein stain or with silver staining to provide a more sensitive indication of total proteins. This general scheme has been used to successfully purify the 43 kd and 70 kd antigens from the A375 cell line and has proven effective also for comparable purification from human ovarian and squamous carcinoma cell lines. The general scheme is also expected to permit purification of the 20 kd antigen \n\nfrom A375 cells and of RAA's from all other cell lines and tissue extracts expressing RAA's.</p>Example 3 Isolation of Preparations Containing RAAs</p>3(a) RAAs in particulate fraction tumor cell lines. Preparation of particulate fraction from cells and cell lines. Six grams wet weight of cultured tumor cells were lysed in approximately four volumes of Buffer L [50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.2) containing 5 mM EDTA and 5 mM EGTA] by five strokes of homogenization in a motor driven Teflon\u2122 homogenizer. The cell lysate was clarified at 3,000 X g for 10 minutes, the supernatant was saved and the pellet was suspended in three volumes of Buffer L by homogenization. This suspension was centrifuged again at 3,000 X g for 10 minutes. The supernatant was saved and the pellet was once more resuspended in three volumes of Buffer L and clarified by centrifugation as above. All three supernatants were pooled and were centrifuged at 100,000 X g for 1 hour.</p>The pelleted particulate preparation was resuspended in Buffer L supplemented with 50% sucrose by five passages in the motorized homogenizer. A ten milliliter sample of the suspension was layered on the bottom of a 40 ml VTi50 centrifuge tube, (Beckman Instruments, Irvine, California) containing a discontinuous gradient of 50%, 40%, 30% and 20% sucrose. Tubes were sealed and spun in VTi50 rotor (Beckman Instruments) for 2 hours at 45,000 rpm (with slow acceleration and no application of the brake).</p>Particulate material RAAs banded at approximately 40% sucrose. This band was harvested by direct aspiration, diluted five-fold with 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 and centrifuged at 100,000 X g for one hour. Pelleted particulate material containing \n\nthe antigens are resuspended by homogenization in 3 ml of 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 and stored frozen at -20\u00b0C. In a typical preparation protocol approximately 6 mg of total protein was present in a final particulate material pellet, while approximately 190 mg of protein was discarded at various stages in purification starting with 6 g wet weight of cells.</p>3(b) RAAs from conditioned media of cultured tumor cells. Purification of secreted regression-associated antigens. In view of the localization of the 20 kd, 38 kd, 43 kd and 70 kd RAAs in the cell particulate fraction, it was of interest to assess whether any of these antigens could be recovered in serum-free media obtained from cultured tumor cells. Preliminary immunoblot experiments indicated that the serum-free \"conditioned\" media obtained from confluent cultures of A375 cells or 69-2 cell contain RAAs with the 38 kd antigen in abundance. In FIG. 1, the lanes numbered 2, contained the conditioned media RAA proteins from ING-A (A375) cell cultures.</p>Purification of the 38 kd antigen secreted by both A375 and 69-2 cells into the culture medium was performed as follows. Two liters of medium was conditioned, for 48 hours by of 3 X 10<sup>9</sup> A375 cells, centrifuged at 10,000 X g for 10 minutes, and then filtered through a 0.45 y Nalgene<sup>\u00ae</sup> filter (Nalgene, Inc. Rochester, New York). The filtrate was concentrated to 50 ml using an Amicon YM10 filter (Amicon Corp., Danvers, Massachusetts) and dialyzed against two liters of Buffer A [10 mM NaPO<sub>4</sub> (pH 7.4)], followed by centrifugation at 10,000 X g for 20 minutes. The supernatant from the centrifugation step was loaded onto a DEAE-Sephacel column (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was then washed with 75 ml of buffer A in order to remove unbound material. The 38 kd antigen did not bind to the column \n\nand was recovered in the unbound fraction which was concentrated on an Amicon YM10 filter to a volume of 10 ml.</p>The concentrated DEAE-purified antigen was applied to a heparin-agarose (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Missouri) column (2 ml) equilibrated with Buffer A. The column was sequentially washed with 20 ml of each of 50 mM, 100 mM, 200 mM and 500 mM NaCl in Buffer A. The 38 kd antigen eluted primarily in 200 mM NaCl wash, but smaller amounts also eluted in the 100 mM and 50 mM washes. The 200 mM eluent was concentrated on an Amicon YM10 filter to 1 ml, applied to a C8 reverse phase HPLC column and eluted with a 30%-60% linear acetonitrile gradient. The 38 kd antigen eluted at about 50% acetonitrile. Very similar elution properties for the 38 kd RAA have been obtained using a C4 reverse phase HPLC column. Analysis of the 38 kd material by reducing SDS-PAGE analysis followed by silver staining showed this 38 kd material to be &gt; 95% pure. In a typical preparation following the procedure described above, approximately 30 \u03bcg of 38 kd antigen preparation was obtained from about 300 mg of total starting protein present in 2 liters of media conditioned for 48 hours with 3 X 10<sup>9</sup> A375 cells. Substantial purification of secreted 38 kd RAA was achieved using this procedure. The HPLC-purified antigen represents ten thousand-fold purification over the conditioned media, based on the amount of other contaminating proteins eliminated, as may be gathered from Table 7 in which the degree of purification achieved at various steps in the process is indicated. In Table 7, the term \"fold purification\" refers to the extent of purification based upon removal of contaminating proteins. \n\n\n\n \n\n</p>Example 4</p>Patient Monitoring by</p>Examining Antibodies to RAAs</p>4(a) Monitoring titers of RAAbs in patients regressing tumors after intralymphatic immunotherapy. Serum samples from patients undergoing immunotherapy are tested as described above using immunoblotting of various human tumor cell extracts containing RAAs. Various dilutions of sera samples from each patient are evaluated for the ability to detect one or more of the specific size RAAs.</p>RAAbs have thus been quantitated in sera obtained at different times after initiating a therapy in a patient with metastatic ovarian cancer. Approximately six weeks after initiation of immunotherapy, one patient's serum had an RAAb titer of about 1:2000 against the 43 kd RAA and this titer reached 1:5000 three months later. Similar demonstrable elevations in titers of RAAbs to one or more RAA have been observed in patients as their tumors begin to regress subsequent to intralymphatic treatment of various other malignancies.</p>The assay presented here for the quantitation of RAAb titer may also be used in monitoring the effects of drugs on patients undergoing immunotherapy. This is illustrated by results obtained with a thyroid cancer patient who demonstrated tumor regression after intralymphatic immunotherapy but was subsequently treated with a high dose of prednisone for symptoms of shortness of breath. Such steroid therapy is known to suppress the immune system. Within 5 days after initiating high dose prednisone therapy, there was complete elimination of detectable RAAb titer against the 70 kd RAA as compared to a titer of 1:2000 detected previously in the same patient. Thus, the formation of \n\nRAAbs appears to follow a normal course of an active immune response to an antigen in that the RAAb titer is suppressed by immunosuppressants such as prednisone. 4(b) Monitoring the RAA specificities of RAAbs in patients undergoing intralymphatic immunotherapy. The techniques according to the present invention are useful in the assessment of response to immunotherapy not only for determining the titers of RAAbs but also for determining the different molecular species of the RAAs to which the RAAbs are directed. Different reactivities develop during the course of immunotherapy, as demonstrated by results for one patient with an initial reactivity directed against the 43 kd antigen followed by the appearance of RAAbs reacting with this 43 kd species as well as with the 38 kd and the 70 kd RAAs. The detection of RAAbs correlates in this patient with the complete regression of pulmonary metastasis of an ovarian adenocarcinoma. Similarly, in a second patient the detection of RAAbs to the 43 kd and the 70 kd RAAs coincided with an evaluable reduction in the size of a pulmonary metastasis of thyroid cancer as well as a profound improvement in the patient's sense of well-being, physical stamina and appetite.</p>Example 5</p>Development Of Antibodies Against Human RAAs in Animals</p>5(a) Preparation of High-Titer Polyclonal RAAbs in Rabbits. Antisera may be specifically produced by immunizing rabbits with injections of purified RAAs according to the present invention as follows. A first inoculation may contain membranes or soluble RAAs</p>(purified from solubilized membranes or from conditioned \n\nmedium) with Freund's incomplete adjuvant or with alumadsorbed tetanus toxin as an adjuvant. Succeeding inoculations may contain the RAA and Freund's incomplete adjuvant. The animals are bled to obtain sera. Polyclonal antibodies may be isolated from the sera by conventional techniques known in the art. Handbook of Experimental Immunology, Vol. 3, Weir, ed., A 3.1 to A 4.10, Blackwell Scientific Publications (1978). Alternately, affinity columns containing purified RAAs bound to Affi-gel 10\u2122 (Bio-Rad) may be prepared using supplier's instructions. Highly specific polyclonal antibodies may be prepared using this affinity column by. conventional procedures. Affinity Chromatography, 41-44 and 92-95 Pharmacia AB, Uppsala, Sweden. High-titer (i.e., greater than 1:10,000) rabbit antisera specific for 38 kd, 43 kd and 70 kd human RAAs have been produced, as indicated in FIG. 1. with sera from rabbit 209.</p>5(b) Monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies according to the present invention may be produced according to the procedure of Kohler et al.. Nature, 256, 495 (1975) with the substitution of a preparation of RAA according to Example 4 for an antigen employed therein. Kohler et al. is incorporated by reference herein.</p>Basically, monoclonal antibodies are produced by injecting mice with immunizing doses of RAAs, as described above for rabbit immunization. Spleens are removed from the immunized animals, and spleen cells are fused to myeloma cells using a fusogen, such as polyethylene glycol. Hybridoma cells producing monoclonals are selected for in a selective growth medium such as the conventional HAT medium. Monoclonal antibodies specific for RAAs may be isolated by chromatography from media in which such hybridomas have been cultured. Brown et al., J. Immunol. , 131, 180-185 (1981). \n\n Example 6</p>Use of Antibodies Directed Against Regression-Associated Antigens</p>6(a) Regression-associated antigen purification. Affinity chromatography using RAAbs bound to appropriate matrices such as Sepharose\u2122 or Affi-gel\u2122 can be used to generate highly-purified preparations of RAAs from human tumor cell extracts.
