    "an (W). </p> The following examples are presented in order to more fully illustrate some embodiments of the invention. They should, in no way be construed, however, as limiting the broad scope of the invention. One skilled in the art can readily devise many variations and modifications of the principles disclosed herein without departing from the scope of the invention. </p>EXAMPLES </p>Materials and Methods </p> Multimeric multiepitope polypeptides: </p> Multimeric-multiepitope polypeptides comprising several repeats of the influenza virus peptide epitopes El to E9 listed in Table 2 were produced and tested. In addition to peptide epitopes, the polypeptides include amino acids and short peptides as spacers. The polypeptides are arranged in an alternating sequential polymeric structure or a block copolymer structure. The polypeptides are prepared by expression in an expression vector from a polynucleotide construct comprising various restriction sites for further manipulation of the polypeptide. The polynucleotide construct is supplied from a commercial source. \n\n Vaccines prepared from the multimeric-multiepitope polypeptides are used for immunization studies of various mouse models and in clinical trials in human subjects. </p> A multimeric polypeptide with three repeats of each of nine different epitopes arranged in block copolymer structure [E1]3-[E2]3-[E3]3-[E4]3-[E5]3-[E6]3-[E7]3-[E8]3-[E9]3, was produced and denoted M-001. The estimated molecular weight of M-001 is 48 kD. The amino acid sequence of the M-001 multimeric polypeptide is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 86. </p> The DNA sequence of the polynucleotide construct used to prepare the M-001 multimeric peptide is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 85. </p> Additional multimeric-multiepitope polypeptide sequences are selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID NO:84 and SEQ ID NO: 88 encoded by polynucleotide sequences comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID NO: 83 and SEQ ID NO: 87 respectively. </p> Vaccine compositions according to the present invention may be administered without the need of an adjuvant. Alternatively, the composition may comprise an adjuvant. In such cases, optional adjuvant used in clinical trials is IFA in animal studies and Montanide\u2122 ISA 51 VG (Seppic, France) in human trials. Montanide\u2122 is a commonly used immune modulator that has been employed in many clinical trials testing vaccine efficacy, capable of inducing both cellular and humoral immune responses (Peek et al., Adv Drug Deliv Rev. 2008; 60, 915-928). </p>Example 1: Production process of M-001 - option A </p> Fermentation process: The fermentation process was performed using heat-shock inducible E. coli recombinantly expressing the M-001 polypeptide. An overnight inoculum was added to 10L bacterial growth medium. The fed-batch process was carried out at 36\u00b0C. Induction was initiated by increasing the temperature to 42\u00b0C. Two hours after induction, the batch was terminated at final volume of"
