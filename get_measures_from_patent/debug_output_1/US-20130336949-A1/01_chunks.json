    "alt solution (HBSS) containing 125 mM sodium gluconate, 4.8 mM potassium gluconate, 1.3 mM calcium, 5.6 mM glucose, 1.2 mM magnesium sulfate, 1.2 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>and 25 mM HEPES (pH7.4). Before the uptake assay started, the culture medium was removed and the cells were incubated for 5 min in 0.6 ml of HBSS. After that HBSS was removed, the prepared reaction solutions were added into each well and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Then the reaction solution was removed, cells were washed twice with 0.6 ml of cold HBSS and lysed with 0.2 ml of 0.1 M NaOH for 20 min. The cell lysates were transferred into the scintillation vials containing 1 ml of scintillation fluid (Opti Phase SuperMIX, PerkinElmer, Cat No. 1200-439) and the radioactivity was counted in the Microbeta counter (1450, Wallac Jet, PerkinElmer). Test compounds were dissolved in DMSO and the same concentration of DMSO was added into the wells of mock-HEK cells and the hURAT1-HEK cells that didn't contain test compounds. For each test compound, the uptake assay was performed 2 times and carried out in triplicate. Urate uptake of the cells for each test condition was presented as the average percent inhibition in comparison to the DMSO control. The radioactivity values obtained for the wells that contained DMSO were taken as 100% uptake of the cells. The observed concentration-percent inhibition data were fitted to a sigmoidal concentration-effect model, where:</p>% Inhibition=(100*Conc\u0302Slope)/(IC50\u0302Slope+Conc\u0302Slope)\n</p>IC<sub>50 </sub>and slope estimates with their 95% confidence limits were determined by a non-linear, least-squares regression analysis using the Data Analysis Toolbox\u2122 (MDL Information Systems, San Leandro, Calif., USA).</p>For assessment of activity of compounds as URAT1 inhibitors, the percent inhibition of uric acid uptake was typically assessed at a drug concentration of 10 micromolar (Table1). Additional drug concentrations of some compounds were tested for determination of IC-50 values (Table 2). In this example the compounds were not necessarily tested simultaneously.</p>TABLE 1Inhibitory effects of the test compounds at the concentration of10 \u03bcM on <sup>14</sup>C urate uptake in hURAT1-HEK cellsTest Compound% of InhibitionS.D.EB90.00.29EC95.20.67ED960.7EF920.6EG95.570.39BD56.572.64EH80.001.29EI44.001.53</p>TABLE 2CompoundIC50 values (\u03bcM)EB0.93EC0.24ED0.25EF0.74EG0.13Benzbromarone0.75Probenecid174</p>Example 10Mouse Oral Single-Dose Pharmacokinetic Study with Compound EBDetermination of the Plasma profile of Compound EB following single oral gavage administration to male mice:</p>Test compounds were suspended in 1% HPMC using a tissue homogenizer to minimize particles and maximize uniformity of the suspension and stored at 4\u00b0 C. The formulations was thoroughly mixed just prior to administration. A dose of 100 mg/kg of Compound EB or vehicle (1% HPMC) was administered to male mice by single oral gavage. Mice were placed in urine collectors after dosing for 5 hours, and the total urine output for 5 hours was collected.
