    "nd centrifuged at low speed (1,000 x g) for 10.0 min to remove the culture media. The harvested cells are suspended in half volume of fresh physiological phosphate buffered saline solution and recentrifuged at the same speed. This operation is repeated. The collected cells are then homogenized in ten volumes of 50 mM Tris.HCI (pH 7.4) and 0.5 mM EDTA. The homogenate is centrifuged at 40,000 x g for 30.0 min and the precipitate is collected. The obtained pellet is resuspended in 10 volumes of Tris.HCI buffer and recentrifuged at the same speed. The final pellet is suspended in a small volume of Tris.HCI buffer and the tissue protein content is determined in aliquots of 10-25 \u03bcl volumes. Bovine Serum Albumin is used as the standard in the protein determination according to the method described in Lowry et al., J. Biol. Chem., 193:265 (1951). The volume of the suspended cell membranes is adjusted to give a tissue protein concentration of 1.0 mg/ml of suspension. The prepared membrane suspension (10 times concentrated) is aliquoted in 1.0 ml volumes and stored at -70\u00b0 C until used in subsequent binding experiments. Binding experiments are performed in a 96 well microtiter plate format, in a total volume of 200 \u03bcl. To each well is added the following mixture: 80.0 \u03bcl of incubation buffer made in 50 mM Tris.HCI buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10.0 mM MgCI<sub>2</sub> and 0.5 mM EDTA and 20 \u03bcl of [<sup>3</sup>H]-LSD (S.A., 86.0 Ci/mmol, available from Amersham Life Science), 3.0 nM. The dissociation constant, K<sub>D</sub> of the [<sup>3</sup>H]LSD at the human serotonin 5-HT6 receptor is 2.9 nM, as determined by saturation binding with \n\nincreasing concentrations of [<sup>3</sup>H]LSD. The reaction is initiated by the final addition of 100.0 \u03bcl of tissue suspension. Nonspecific binding is measured in the presence of 10.0 \u03bcM methiothepin. The test compounds are added in 20.0 \u03bcl volume. The reaction is allowed to proceed in the dark for 120 min at room temperature, at which time, the bound ligand-receptor complex is filtered off on a 96 well unifilter with a Packard Filtermate<sup>\u00ae</sup> 196 Harvester. The bound complex caught on the filter disk is allowed to air dry and the radioactivity is measured in a Packard TopCount<sup>\u00ae</sup> equipped with six photomultiplier detectors, after the addition of 40.0\u03bcl Microscint<sup>\u00ae</sup>-20 scintillant to each shallow well. The unifilter plate is heat-sealed and counted in a PackardTopCount<sup>\u00ae</sup> with a tritium efficiency of 31.0%. Specific binding to the 5-HT6 receptor is defined as the total radioactivity bound less the amount bound in the presence of 10.0\u03bcM unlabeled methiothepin. Binding in the presence of varying concentrations of test compound is expressed as a percentage of specific binding in the absence of test compound. The results are plotted as log % bound versus log concentration of test compound. Nonlinear regression analysis of data points with a computer assisted program Prism<sup>\u00ae</sup> yielded both the IC<sub>50</sub> and the K| values of test compounds with 95% confidence limits. A linear regression line of data points is plotted, from which the IC<sub>50</sub> value is determined and the Ki value is determined based upon the following equation: \n\n where L is the concentration of the radioactive ligand used and K<sub>0</sub> is the dissociation constant of the ligand for the receptor, both expressed in nM. Using this assay, the following Ki values are determined and compared to those values obtained by representative compounds known to demonstrate binding to the 5-HT6 receptor. The data are shown in Table I, below. \n\n Table I Test Compound 5-HT6 Binding Ki (Ex.
