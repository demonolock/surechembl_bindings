    "icroarray Software suite (MAS) version 5.0 was used to determine transcript levels and for comparison analysis of different samples.</p>Example 2: Quorum Sensing Modulators</p>[067] The compounds in Table 2 were purchased from Chembridge Corp. (San Diego, CA),</p>Specs (Wakefield, RI), Interbioscreen Ltd. (Moscow, Russia) and Chemical Diversity Labs,</p>Inc. (San Diego, CA), and were characterized with the reporter strain MWl.pUM15 in both microtiter plate format and a shaking tube format. Results for both formats were comparable.</p>The tube format was performed to eliminate plate effects that may mask low levels of inhibition.</p>[068] In both formats, the compounds were tested for (1) activation of the reporter in the absence of an activating signal, and (2) inhibition of the reporter in the presence of 0.3 \u03bcM 3-</p>OXO-C12-HSL. All compounds were tested at 100 \u03bcM for their ability to activate or inhibit quorum sensing using the SRA assay. Compound 1 (Table 2) exhibited the largest degree of inhibition (e.g., it exhibited antagonist activity). Compounds 2, 3, 4 and 5 (Table 3) exhibited activating effects (e.g., they exhibited agonist activity). As shown in Figure 2, Compound 5 exhibits an activating effect equal to 3-oxo-C12-HSL but at reduced concentrations. The activation efficacy, shown in Figure 2, was determined by comparing the fluorescence generated in the SRA, performed in the presence of 0.75 % DMSO, as a function of concentration.</p>[069] Table 3 summaries the EC 50 (concentration for half maximal activation) activation effect of Compounds 2, 3, 4 and 5 relative to 3-oxo-C12-HSL.</p>Table 2: Structure of Compound 1</p><img id=\"imgf000018_0001\" path=\"imgf000018_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/5006695/WO/20060727/A2/002006/07/89/86/imgf000018_0001.tif\"/>\nTable 3: EC 50 Evaluation Relative to 3-oxo-C12-HSL</p><img id=\"imgf000019_0001\" path=\"imgf000019_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/5006698/WO/20060727/A2/002006/07/89/86/imgf000019_0001.tif\"/></p><img id=\"imgf000019_0002\" path=\"imgf000019_0002.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/5006697/WO/20060727/A2/002006/07/89/86/imgf000019_0002.tif\"/></p>Where s means that the EC 50 value of the tested compound is similar to 3-oxo-C12- HSL. + means that the tested compounds exhibited a lower EC 50 value than 3-oxo-C12- HSL. - means that the tested compound exhibited a higher EC 50 value than 3-oxo-C12- HSL. \n</p>"
