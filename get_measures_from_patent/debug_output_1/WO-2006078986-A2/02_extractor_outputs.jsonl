{"raw_mentions": "In both formats, the compounds were tested for (1) activation of the reporter in the absence of an activating signal, and (2) inhibition of the reporter in the presence of 0.3 \u03bcM 3-OXO-C12-HSL.\nAll compounds were tested at 100 \u03bcM for their ability to activate or inhibit quorum sensing using the SRA assay.\nThe activation efficacy, shown in Figure 2, was determined by comparing the fluorescence generated in the SRA, performed in the presence of 0.75 % DMSO, as a function of concentration."}
