Ferumoxytol is known in the art to be effective for treating anemia (at single unit doses lower than described herein). See e.g., Spinowitz et al. (2005) Kidney Intl. 68:1801-1807. Ferumoxytol is a superparamagnetic iron oxide that is coated with a low molecular weight semi-synthetic carbohydrate, polyglucose sorbitol carboxymethyl ether. Ferumoxytol and its synthesis are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,599,498, incorporated herein by reference. Safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of ferumoxytol are as described, for example, in Landry et al. (2005) Am. J. Nephrol. 25:400-410, 408; and Spinowitz et al. (2005) Kidney Intl. 68:1801-1807.</p>The iron oxide of ferumoxytol is a superparamagnetic form of non-stoichiometric magnetite with a crystal size of 6.2 to 7.3 nm. Average colloidal particle size can be about 30 nm, as determined by light scattering. Molecular weight is approximately 750 kD. The osmolarity of ferumoxytol is isotonic at 297 mOsm/kg and the pH is neutral. The blood half-life of ferumoxytol is approximately 10-14 hours. It has been previously reported that ferumoxytol can be given by direct intravenous push over 1-5 minutes in doses up to 1,800 mg elemental iron per minute, with maximal total dose up to 420 mg per injection (Landry et al. (2005) Am. J. Nephrol. 25:400-410, 408).</p>Core and Particle Size</p>Intravenous iron agents are generally spheroidal iron-carbohydrate nanoparticles. At the core of each particle is an iron-oxyhydroxide gel. The core is surrounded by a shell of carbohydrate that stabilizes the iron-oxyhydroxide, slows the release of bioactive iron, and maintains the resulting particles in colloidal suspension. Iron agents generally share the same core chemistry but differ from each other by the size of the core and the identity and the density of the surrounding carbohydrate.
