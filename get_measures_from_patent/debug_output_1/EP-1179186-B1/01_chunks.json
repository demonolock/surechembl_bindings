    "Inc.) as previously described (8). All cells were examined for Mycoplasma contamination every three months using the Mycoplasma PCR kit from Stratagene Inc. (San Diego, CA). For metabolic labeling of cells, CEM or CEM/VLB<sup>1.0</sup> cells at 70-80% confluency were metabolically labeled with [<sup>35</sup>S] methionine (100 \u00b5Ci/ml) for 6 hours at 37\u00b0C in methionine-free \u03b1-MEM media.</p>EXAMPLE 5Cell Extraction and Binding AssayFollowing metabolic labeling of proteins with [<sup>35</sup>S] methionine, cells were washed 3 times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (2 mM PMSF, 3 \u00b5g/ml Leupeptin, 4 \u00b5g/ml pepstatin A and 1 \u00b5g/ml aprotinin) and kept on ice for 30 minutes. Cells were lysed by homogenization in a hypotonic buffer and the cell lysate was sequentially centrifuged at 6000 x g for 10 minutes. Following the latter centrifugation, the supernatant was removed and made 0.5 M NaCl final concentration from a stock solution of 4 M NaCl. The cell lysate was incubated on ice for 30 minutes. The sample was mixed and brought back to 0.1 M NaCl final concentration. The cell lysate was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 15,000 X g at 4\u00b0C. The latter supernatant was removed and recentrifuged at 100,000 X g for 60 minutes in a Beckman ultracentrifuge using SW55 rotor. The amount of protein in the above samples was determined by the method of Lowry (69).</p>For a binding assay, [<sup>35</sup>S] methionine labeled proteins from total cell lysate were mixed with equal volume of 3-6% BSA in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with overlapping hexapeptides covalently fixed to polypropylene rods. The peptides and total cell lysate were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. The rods were then removed and washed four times in PBS. The bound proteins were eluted by incubating the peptide-fixed rods in 1X SDS sample buffer for 60 minutes at room temperature with shaking. The peptides-fixed rods, were regenerated by incubation in PBS, containing 2% SDS and 1 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol at 65\u00b0C in a sonicator for 30 minutes. Following the latter incubation, the rods were washed for five minutes in 65\u00b0C ionized water and two minutes in 65\u00b0C methanol. The peptides-fixed rods are now ready for the next round of screening. In cases where the effects of various detergents on binding was tested, [<sup>35</sup>S] methionine labeled proteins from total cell lysate were mixed with equal volume of 3% BSA in phosphate buffered saline containing KCl (300 mM to 1200 mM), SDS (0.12% to 2%), or CHAPS (20 mM to 160 mM) and incubated with covalently fixed peptides as described above.</p>EXAMPLE 6Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Western BlottingProtein fractions (100-150 \u00b5l) were resolved on SDS-PAGE using the Laemmli gel system (62). Briefly, proteins were dissolved in 1X solubilization sample buffer I (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (w/v)"
