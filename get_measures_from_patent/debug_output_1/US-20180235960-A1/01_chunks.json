For example, the compounds may be radiolabeled with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (<sup>3</sup>H), iodine-125 (<sup>125</sup>I) sulfur-35 (<sup>35</sup>S), or carbon-14 (<sup>14</sup>C), or may be isotopically enriched, such as with deuterium (<sup>2</sup>H), carbon-13 (<sup>13</sup>C), or nitrogen-15 (<sup>15</sup>N). As used herein, an \u201cisotopologue\u201d is an isotopically enriched compound. The term \u201cisotopically enriched\u201d refers to an atom having an isotopic composition other than the natural isotopic composition of that atom. \u201cIsotopically enriched\u201d may also refer to a compound containing at least one atom having an isotopic composition other than the natural isotopic composition of that atom. The term \u201cisotopic composition\u201d refers to the amount of each isotope present for a given atom. Radiolabeled and isotopically enriched compounds are useful as therapeutic agents, e.g., cancer and inflammation therapeutic agents, research reagents, e.g., binding assay reagents, and diagnostic agents, e.g., in vivo imaging agents. All isotopic variations of the TOR kinase inhibitors as described herein, whether radioactive or not, are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the embodiments provided herein. In some embodiments, there are provided isotopologues of the TOR kinase inhibitors, for example, the isotopologues are deuterium, carbon-13, or nitrogen-15 enriched TOR kinase inhibitors.</p>An \u201cadvanced solid tumor\u201d as used herein, means a solid tumor that has spread locally or metastasized or spread to another part of the body.</p>\u201cTreating\u201d as used herein, means an alleviation, in whole or in part, of symptoms associated with a disorder or disease (e.g., a solid tumor (for example, a neuroendocrine tumor, non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, hepatocellular carcinoma breast cancer, colorectal cancer, salivary cancer, pancreatic cancer, adenocystic cancer or adrenal cancer), non-Hodgkin lymphoma or multiple myeloma), or slowing, or halting of further progression or worsening of those symptoms. In another embodiment, the solid tumor is esophageal cancer, renal cancer, leiomyosarcoma, or paraganglioma.</p>\u201cPreventing\u201d as used herein, means the prevention of the onset, recurrence or spread, in whole or in part, of the disease or disorder (e.g., a solid tumor (for example, a neuroendocrine tumor, non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, colorectal cance"
