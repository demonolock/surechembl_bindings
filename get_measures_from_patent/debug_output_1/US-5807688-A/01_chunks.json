    "talysed process that resulted from the contiguity of two reactants in the enzyme site was of the order of 55, that being the effective concentration of small molecules such as water. Jencks and Page (Ref. 67) changed that view through the application of the thermodynamic principles of bimolecular processes and argued that the loss of translational and rotational freedom for two molecules brought into proximity in an enzyme binding site could result in effective molarities (EM) of 10<sup>8</sup> M. Therefore, by preorganising reactants through favourable binding interactions, an antibody should be able to minimise the entropy of activation and hence effect catalysis (Ref. 68,69).</p>Antibody catalysis of a Claisen rearrangement.</p>The enzyme chorismate mutase (EC 5.4.99.5), accelerates the conversion of chorismicacid (2.18) into prephenic acid (2.19) by 3\u00d710<sup>6</sup> and appears to work exclusivelyby restriction of the free rotation of bonds in the substrate, thereby achieving intramolecular juxtaposition of the reacting carbons (FIG. 2D8) (Ref. 70). This Claisen rearrangement has a spontaneous, unimolecular counterpart that proceeds at a measurable rate at room temperature. Several years ago, Knowles (Ref. 71) established the transition state (2.20) for the enzymecatalysed process as having a pseudo diaxial chair-like conformation. Using that information, Bartlett (Ref. 72) produced a transition state analogue (2.21) which proved to be a powerful inhibitor of the enzyme, Ki of 1.5\u00d710<sup>-7</sup> M, binding much more strongly than chorismate (Km 1.5\u00d710<sup>-5</sup> M for the E.coli enzyme).</p>Since the inhibitory activity of this bicyclic species is independent of the substituent on the pendant hydroxyl group, Schultz (Ref. 73) and Hilvert (Ref. 74) used this locus to join the inhibitor to a carrier protein. This hapten was used to raise antibodies that catalysed the conversion of chorismate into prephenate. Their results provide an instructive contrast (Table 2.2). The best of the antibodies elicited by Schultz, 11F1-2E11, achieves a 10<sup>4</sup> acceleration of the reaction, primarily by reducing the entropic barrier of the process almost as effectively as does the enzyme from E. coli. However, the enthalpy of activation is significantly higher than that for the enzymatic reaction. Thus, this antibody has been described as working as an Entropic Trap.<sup>75</sup> By contrast, Hilvert's antibody, 1F7, which is a rather poorer catalyst, has a lower enthalpy of activation than that for the enzymatic process while the entropic barrier is much higher| The conjunction of these results offers the tantalising prospect that a Fab engineered to combine the best features of 1F7 and 11F1-2E11 might outperform the natural enzyme by two to three fold. The genes encoding abzyme 1F7 have been sequenced and expressed in a yeast strain which lacks wild-type chorismate mutase activity (Ref. 76). The Fab produced in this system possesses sufficient activit",
    "ymes could be used to destroy the invasive organisms. Furthermore, in direct analogy with vaccination, a patient could be immunised with the requisite TSA for a reaction which would destroy a specific structural motif of a known pathogen. For example, Clostridium tetani, the cause of tetanus, secretes a potent neurotoxin called tetanospasm. This blocks normal postsynaptic inhibition of spinal reflexes, leading to a generalised muscular spasm or `tetany`. The exotoxin responsible is a protein. Therefore, if a patient were to be immunised with the TSA for amide hydrolysis of this specific protein, at initial exposure to the toxin the patient would already possess immunity which would directly destroy the protein.</p>2.5.6.1 Prodrug activation by antibodies</p>Many therapeutic agents are administered as prodrugs. The prodrug is a chemically modified form of the therapeutic agent designed to improve either its pharmacokinetic, pharmacological, or toxicological profiles. Antibody mediated prodrug activation was first exemplified by Fujii's group in Osaka (FIG. 2D18) (Ref. 116). By raising antibodies to both phosphonate haptens (2.53) and (2.54), he generated abzymes that hydrolysed a single regioisomer of the ester prodrug (2.55) or (2.56) of chloramphenicol (2.57) (FIG. 2D18). One of the active clones, 6D9, hydrolysed the prodrug (2.56) with Michaelis-Menten kinetics and a rate enhancement, kcat/kuncat, of 1.8\u00d710<sup>3</sup>. It was inhibited selectively by hapten (2.54), with a Ki of 0.06 mM. Furthermore, Fujii (Ref. 116) showed unequivocally that the principle was viable by effecting growth inhibition of Bacillus subtilis on a confluence plate by means of the ester (2.56) only in the presence of 6D9. Biotechnology companies in the U.S., including IGEN (FIG. 2D19)(Ref. 117) and Affymax (Ref. 118) have been seeking to develop the use of abzymes for activation of prodrugs for cancer therapy. It is well known that anticancer agents suffer from severe side effects. Therefore, administration of a prodrug of reduced toxicity which can be activated in vivo would be of invaluable use in cancer treatment (Chapter 3, Section 3.1.2).</p>2.5.7 Conclusion</p>The increasing subtleties associated with the generation of catalytic antibodies have been reflected by increasingly complex hapten design. Transition state stabilisation, charged active site residues, distortion, desolvation, proximity effects, and enantioselectivity are all features of antibody catalysis that can be induced by ingenious hapten design. However, hyper-rational hapten design or mimicry of the nth component of a reaction mechanism may well be unnecessary and lead to surprising results in terms of the antibodies isolated.</p>For example, the hapten (2.61) was designed to elicit antibodies to catalyse the hydrolysis of an ester (2.62) (FIG. 2D20). No catalysts were isolated in initial experiments (Ref. 121). However, after repeated immunisations with the same hapten, antibody 50D8 was isolated w",
    "presented in a sensorgram (FIG. 5D). The y axis of the sensorgram is the resonance signal and is expressed in response units (RU). The running buffer defines the baseline and all responses are expressed relative to this level. At a given time the relative response, R, can be expressed as:</p>R=R.sub.R +R.sub.L +R.sub.A                                (5.3)</pre></p>where R<sub>R</sub> is the refractive index component for the sample buffer, R<sub>L</sub> is the component for immobilised ligand and R<sub>A</sub> is the component for analyte bound to immobilised ligand. The change in signal level with respect to time is:</p>dR/dt=dR.sub.R /dt+dR.sub.L /dt+dR.sub.A /dt               (5.4)</pre></p>Except for the 10-20 seconds at the beginning and at the end of an injection dR<sub>R</sub> /dt=0, and hence R<sub>R</sub> is constant. Furthermore, because the ligand is immobilised, dR<sub>L</sub> /dt=0. Therefore, the change D in response level reflects binding of the analyte and:</p>dR/dt=dR.sub.A /dt                                         (5.5)</pre></p>Theoretical Background.When analyte A reacts with ligand B to form the complex AB, the net rate of complex formation (at equilibrium) depends on the free concentration of the A and B components and on the stability of the complex formed. This can be expressed in eqn. (5.6):</p>d AB!/dt=k.sub.a  A! B!-k.sub.d  AB!                       (5.6)</pre></p>The association rate constant is k<sub>a</sub> (M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) and kd is the dissociation rate constant (s<sup>-1</sup>). In the biosensor, the ligand B is immobilised on the sensor surface. Therefore, the concentration of the complex  AB! is identical to the concentration of the bound analyte. From eqn. (5.4) the concentration of bound analyte is proportional to the response R<sub>A</sub>. Free ligand concentration  B! is the difference between total and bound ligand concentration. The total concentration of active immobilised ligand is obtained indirectly as it is saturated with analyte. The maximum response due to analyte binding, R<sub>max</sub>, will therefore be proportional to total ligand concentration and (R<sub>max</sub> -R<sub>A</sub>) will be proportional to free ligand concentration. When the analyte is injected in a stream over the sensor surface the analyte solution is constantly replenished and hence the free concentration of the analyte is constant and identical to total analyte concentration. The reaction between immobilised ligand and analyte in solution can therefore be assumed to follow pseudo-first-order kinetics and the concentration of complex  AB! and free ligand can now be expressed in terms of analyte response. Given that C is the concentration of injected analyte, equation (5.6) can be rewritten:</p>dR.sub.A /dt=k.sub.a C(R.sub.max -RA)-k.sub.d RA           (5.7)</pre></p>Rate and Equilibrium Constant Determination.A rearrangement of eqn. (5.7) gives</p>dR.sub.A /dt=k.sub.a C R.sub.max -(k.sub.a C+k.sub.d)R.sub.A(5.8)</pre></p>Rate constants can now be evaluated by a plot of dR<sub>A</sub> /dt vs. R<sub>A</sub> provided that R<sub>max</sub> and C are known and therefore:</p>dR/dt=constant-(k.sub.a C+kd)R                             (5.9)</pre></p>Using this equation, the detector response, R, can be used directly and no correction for responses due to differences in refractive index from the buffer components are necessary.</p>To determine the association constant, k<sub>a</sub>, several concentrations of analyte are injected and the slope value ks, obtained from each dR/dt vs. R plot, are introduced into a new plot vs. analyte concentration such that:</p>k.sub.s =k.sub.a C+k.sub.d                                 (5.10)</pre></p>From relationship (5.10) the association rate constant is readily obtained as the slope of the plot. Theoretically, the dissociation rate is obtained from the intercept on the y axis. However, this intercept cannot be determined accurately when kd is low. A more useful experiment is measuring dissociation of the analyte in pure buffer flow (FIG. 5D). No analyte is present in the buffer, therefore dR<sub>A</sub> /dt=-kdR<sub>A</sub>. The dissociation follows a simple exponential decay such that:</p>ln(R.sub.A 1/R.sub.n)=k.sub.d (t.sub.n -t.sub.l)           (5.11)</pre></p>where R<sub>A</sub> 1 is the response level at t=1, the start time for the assay. R<sub>n</sub> and t<sub>n</sub> are points along the dissociation curve. Therefore, because at equilibrium the rates of association and dissociation of the analyte (A) with the bound ligand (B) are equal:</p>k.sub.a  A! B!=k.sub.d  AB!                                (5.12)</pre></p>K.sub.a = A! B!/ AB!=k.sub.a /k.sub.d                      (5.13)</pre></p>Therefore, as a result of being able to monitor the antibody binding over time, it is possible to determine both the association and dissociation constants very rapidly and hence the equilibrium affinity constant (K<sub>a</sub>).</p>6. OVERVIEW OF EXAMPLESThe aim is to produce monoclonal antibodies that can hydrolyse aryl carbamate esters (6.1) via the disfavoured B<sub>AC</sub> 2 mechanism (FIG. 6A). In Chapter 4, the alternative mechanisms for carbamate hydrolysis were discussed. The two transition states have sufficiently different steric and electronic features such that design of transition state analogues for the B<sub>AC</sub> 2 process should elicit antibodies which selectively stabilise this transition state ",
    " complete affinity constants for the cell lines elicited to the hapten (7.2 and 7.4) are also listed in Appendix A, tables 1 and 2.</p>An important question when needing to accurately determine the affinity constants of a large number of monoclonals is how reproducible is the assay from run to run. With a view to answering this question, the experiment was repeated 4 times for a purified monoclonal, EA11-D7, and the results are shown in table 8.6. The assay showed good reproducibility with the K<sub>a</sub> values varying from the mean by no more than 25%. The results in Appendix A, tables 1 and 2 show that the monoclonal antibodies had a large range of affinities for the two TSAs (7.2 and 7.4), ranging from 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>11</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>. It has been found that catalytic antibodies can have an affinity as low as 10<sup>5</sup> for their TSA (Ref. 27). It was felt that any of the antibodies may be catalytic and so none of them were discarded. One of the antibodies, CF7, showed no binding to the TSA (7.37) in the BIAcore assay but had an affinity of 5.2\u00d710<sup>6</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> in the ELISA. This was thought to be due to the antibody only recognising the linker group and therefore this cell line was abandoned. A limitation of the BIAcore assay was encountered when measuring the affinity of the antibody BG11. It dissociated so slowly within the time course of the assay (ca. 5 min), that an accurate measurement of the change in RUs could not be made and a kd couldn't be measured. The ELISA was able to determine the aK for this clone because the inhibitor concentration could be lowered to a concentration at which 0% inhibition occurred. It has been reported that there are significant differences in the values of the equilibrium association constants determined by different assays such as equilibrium dialysis and precipitation assays (Ref. 238). BIAcore is a new technique for Ka determinations and because of the large population of monoclonals available, the affinities of all the monoclonals elicited to haptens (7.2 and 7.4) were determined by both BIAcore and ELISA and a comparison between the two was made (Appendix A, tables 1 and 2). In common with observations from other groups, (Ref. 239) the results from both techniques were fairly compatible. The affinities are ranked very similarly, with the majority of measurements being within 25% of each other which was the inter-assay variability encountered with this procedure (Table 8.6). This suggests that either the avidity effect, described above, is minimal in the ELISA assay, or, that there is an inaccuracy in the BIAcore process that is artificially elevating the binding constant. This inaccuracy has been suggested to be caused by `re-binding` of the antibody during the dissociation phase (Ref. 240). The phenomena is caused because the hydrogel is 100 nm in depth and not a monolayer, consequently antibody that is dissociating from deep within the hydrogel can feasibly re-bind to antigen situated higher on the dextran surface. This has the effect of reducing the kd and hence elevating the observed K<sub>a</sub>, To assess whether re-binding was contributing to the overall affinity of the antibodies a control experiment was run which involved immobilising the TSA (7.37) on the hydrogel and then injecting a TSA (7.2) specific monoclonal antibody onto the sensor chip and following the association phase. Instead of allowing the antibody to dissociate under the effect of buffer the antibody was washed off the chip with increasing concentrations of TSA (7.37). The free TSA (7.37) competes with the bound TSA (7.37) in the same way as in the inhibition ELISA preventing re-binding, which elevates the kd to its true value. It was found that re-binding was a minimal component of the affinity constant, contributing &lt;15% of the kd and therefore was not thought to be the major cause of the similarity between aK values determined by ELISA and the K<sub>a</sub> values measured on the BIAcore. One further explanation is that avidity may be contributing to the affinity constant measurements on the BIAcore. In theory the hydrogel is a mobile surface which should preclude avidity but it may be possible at certain concentrations of antigen that binding can occur to multiple epitopes and hence avidity would contribute to the measured binding constant. This is difficult to prove experimentally but would probably involve sequentially lowering the amount of immobilised immunogen on the hydrogel and determining whether there was any correlation with the measured affinity constants.</p>8.5.2 Isotyping</p>During the immunisation schedule no attempt was made to measure the hapten specific isotype response of the Mab. It was hoped that the immunisation schedules were of a sufficient duration to generate affinity matured isotypes (IgG). Therefore it was quite important at an early stage after fusions to determine whether the antibodies were predominantly IgG or IgM. The enzyme-labelled secondary antibody in the ELISA screen is IgG specific. However, it has been both reported in the literature (Ref. 237) and found by experience in the lab that this enzyme-labelled antibody can cross-react with IgMs. Therefore, to ensure that none of the positive clones were IgM, isotyping was performed very early in the cell-line's life-time. Isotyping was performed by two procedures: ELISA and BIAcore. A typical example of an ELISA experiment is shown in FIG. 8C4. The labour intensive nature and length of assay (48 h) for the ELISA assay has meant that other techniques were sought to improve the isotyping determination. For this reason a BIAcore method was utilised. The experiment involved binding the TSAs (7.37 or 7.50) via their free aniline groups to the hydrogel as described above. The antibody to be isotyped was then washed o",
    "d analogue should contain only a few features of the products to minimise product inhibition. Tawfik elicited antibodies to the hapten (9.6) and screened the clones that recognised the hapten for recognition of 4-nitrophenyl methylphosphonate (9.7) (FIG. 9C2). Tawfik found that many of the antibodies which recognised the short transition state analogue (9.7) with comparable affinity to the parent hapten were also catalytic (&gt;50%). The apparent generality of this procedure and the routine nature of measuring binding affinities on a BIAcore machine made this technique an interesting option. All the antibodies (35 cell lines) generated to the phosphonamidate ester (7.2) were incorporated in this study which sought to correlate the affinity of antibodies for the attenuated transition state analogue (9.8) to their activity shown in the SRB assay (FIG. 9C3).</p>The inhibition BIAcore assay was a modification of a method described by Altschuh et al. (Ref. 257). The phosphonamidate (7.37) was bound to the CM5 sensor chip by the procedure mentioned in Chapter 8 (Section 8.5.2.2). The experiment involved injecting known concentrations (50 \u03bcg ml-1) of antibody onto the chip and following the association phase. During this binding phase a known concentration of the inhibitor (9.8) was also injected. The inhibitor competes with the solid phase antigen (7.37) for the antibody and hence washes the antibody off the sensor chip in an exaggerated dissociation phase. This dissociation rate (kd) increased in the presence of inhibitor to a plateau rate (k<sub>max</sub>), which is antibody dependent, and the concentration of inhibitor that caused 50% of kmax, I<sub>50</sub>, was measured for each antibody. This gave the `relative` affinities of each clone for the attenuated transition state analogue. The lower the I<sub>50</sub> for the inhibitor, the higher is the `relative` affinity of the antibody for the inhibitor (FIG. 9C4).</p>The I<sub>50</sub> values, determined graphically, were then correlated with catalytic activity as determined in the SRB screen and the linearity of the relationship examined (FIG. 9C5). This experiment has been performed only once and therefore significance of the correlation (r=0.8) has to be treated with care. However, it is clear that the correlation is far superior to that observed between affinity for the transition state and activity (r=0.13). This result supports Tawfik's (Ref. 256) original findings, suggesting that a good strategy when designing haptens for eliciting catalytic antibodies is to synthesise an attenuated transition state mimic and then all the clones that are positive for the TSA can be screened against this compound and the strongest binders, judging from this work and that of Tawfik, have a good chance of being catalytic. The most satisfying feature of the correlation is how the three most active clones in the SRB assay have the highest relative affinities for the attenuated transition state analogue (9.8), whi"
