    " use of an amino acid sequencer, or (3) to homogeneity as demonstrated by SDS-PAGE under reducing or non-reducing conditions and coomassie blue staining or preferably silver staining. Typically, the isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.</p>The term \"specifically binds\" or \"specifically binds to\" or \"specifically with\" refers to the binding of a binding moiety to a binding target, such as the binding of an antibody to a target antigen, e.g., a specific polypeptide, epitope on a peptide, or other target (e.g., a glycoprotein target) and means a binding that is measurably different from a non-specific interaction (e.g., a non-specific interaction can bind to bovine serum albumin or casein). Specific binding can be measured, for example, by determining the binding of a binding moiety or antibody or an antibody modified by the introduction of a binding moiety to a target molecule as compared to binding to a control molecule. For example, specific binding can be determined by competition with a control molecule that is similar to the target (e.g., an excess of unlabeled target). In this case, specific binding is indicated if the binding of labeled target to probe is competitively inhibited by an excess of unlabeled target. The term \"specifically binds\" or \"specifically binds\" to \"or\" specific for \"a particular polypeptide or an epitope on a particular polypeptide target as used herein may be exhibited, for example, by a molecule having the following Kd for the target: at least about 200nM, or at least about 150nM, or at least about 100nM, or at least about 60nM, or at least about 50nM, or at least about 40nM, or at least about 30nM, or at least about 20nM, or at least about 10nM, or at least about 8nM, or at least about 6nM, or at least about 4nM, or at least about 2nM, or at least about 1nM or greater. In certain instances, the term \"specific binding\" refers to the following binding: wherein the molecule binds to a particular polypeptide or epitope on a particular polypeptide and does not substantially bind to any other polypeptide or polypeptide epitope.</p>\"binding affinity\" refers to the overall strength of a non-covalent interaction between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g., an antigen). Unless otherwise indicated, \"binding affinity\" as used herein refers to intrinsic binding affinity, which reflects a 1:1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., antibody and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be expressed by the dissociation constant (Kd). For example, the Kd may be about 200nM, 150nM, 100nM, 60nM, 50nM, 40nM, 30nM, 20nM, 10nM, 8nM, 6nM, 4nM, 2nM, 1nM or stronger. Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art, including those described herein. Low affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to dissociate easily, while high affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain bound longer. Various methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art.</p>As used herein, \"Kd\" or \"Kd value\" refers to the dissociation constant as measured by a technique suitable for antibody and target pairs, e.g., determined using surface plasmon resonance, e.g., using BIAcore at 25 \u2103<sup>TM</sup>-2000 or BIAcore<sup>TM</sup>3000(BIAcore, inc., Piscataway, n.j.), using approximately 10 Reaction Units (RU) of immobilized antigen CM5 wafers.</p>The terms \"conjugate,\" \"conjugated,\" and \"conjugation\" refer to any and all forms of covalent or non-covalent linkage, and include, but are not limited to, direct genetic or chemical fusion, coupling via a linker or cross-linking agent, and non-covalent association.</p>The term \"fusion\" as used herein refers to the combination of amino acid sequences of different origin in one polypeptide chain by in-frame combination of their encoding nucleotide sequences. In addition to fusion to one of its ends, the term \"fusion\" also explicitly includes internal fusions, i.e. insertions of sequences of different origin within a polypeptide chain. The term \"fusion\" as used herein refers to a combination of amino acid sequences of different origin.</p>The term \"valency\" as used herein denotes the presence of a specific number of binding sites in an antibody. Thus, the terms \"divalent,\" \"tetravalent,\" and \"hexavalent\" indicate the presence of two binding sites, four binding sites, and six binding sites, respectively. Thus, if each binding unit is bivalent in a bispecific IgA antibody according to the invention, the bispecific IgA antibody will have a valency of 4.</p>Th"
