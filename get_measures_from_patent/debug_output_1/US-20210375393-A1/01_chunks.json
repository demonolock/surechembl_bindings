In some embodiments, the regression process produces a series of equations that allow prediction of binding affinity using the physical properties of the subsets of amino acids. In some embodiments, the regression process produces a series of equations that allow prediction of binding affinity using the physical properties of amino acids within the subsets. In some embodiments, the neural network performance with test peptide sets is not statistically different at the 5% level when applied to random peptide sets. In some embodiments, the processes further comprise utilizing a number of hidden nodes in the multi-layer perceptron that correlates to the number of amino acids accommodated by a MHC binding region. In some embodiments, the number of hidden nodes is from about 8 to about 60.</p>In some embodiments, the neural network is validated with a training set of binding affinities of peptides of known amino acid sequence. In some embodiments, the neural network is trained to predict binding to more than one MHC binding region. In some embodiments, the neural network produces a set of equations that describe and predict the contribution of the physical properties of each amino acids in the subsets to Ln(Ki). In some embodiments, peptide subsets representing at least 25% of the proteome of a target source are analyzed using the equations to provide the LN(k<sub>d</sub>) for at least one MHC binding region. In some embodiments, a standardization process is carried out on sets of raw binding affinity data so that characteristics of different MHC molecules can be compared and combined directly even though they have different underlying distributional properties. In the process of standardization the mean of a set of numbers is subtracted from each value in the set and the resulting number divided by the standard deviation. This creates a new set in a transformed variable with a mean of zero and unit variance (and standard deviation as the standard deviation=square root of the variance). These transformed data sets provide a number of desirable properties for statistical analyses.</p>In some embodiments, the processes further comprise the step of determining the cellular location of the subsets of peptides, wherein the cellular location is selected from the group consisting of intracellular, extracellular, within a membrane, signal peptide, and combinations thereof.

In some embodiments, the present invention provides a computer system or a computer readable medium comprising a NN trained to predict binding to each different HLA allele, which produces a set of equations that describe and predict the contribution of the physical properties of each amino acid to ln(K<sub>d</sub>). Interestingly, the physical properties of the amino acids are being used to predict a number directly related to a thermodynamic property the Gibbs free energy: \u0394G<sup>0</sup>=\u2212RT In K. In JMP\u00ae, these equations are stored in a format within the program for prediction of binding affinities of other peptides of equivalent length. Other statistical software may store the results differently for subsequent use. The JMP\u00ae statistical application that was used to produce the NN fits has a method of storing equations to define columns of numbers. A macro defining the NN output is connected to a column for each allele prediction. In practice, an empty table was created where an input peptide n-mer sequence would be defined a 3\u00d7(n-mer) vector of physical properties which in turn was used by equations of other columns to store the predicted ln(K<sub>d</sub>). One column was assigned to each NN for which training had been done. Each Row of table Genome.GI.N.C. {pep1 . . . pepN}. {PC1 . . . PCN}. MHC-I{LN(Kd)1 . . . LN(Kd)j}. MHC-II{LN(Kd)1 . . . LN(K<sub>d</sub>)k}.</p>Each overlapping peptide in the proteome is assigned to one row in the data table. The number of columns in the data table varies depending on the size of peptide and the number of MHC allele affinities being predicted. Using the methodology above, predictive NN were developed for 35 MHC-I and 14 MHC-II molecules. The predictive ability of the NN was validated by comparing the results of the NN to the reference method. The NN produced showed a reliability greater than the established methods (Table 4). The NN prediction equations were stored in the JMP\u00ae platform system so that they could be applied to peptides from various proteomes (Process B). The neural net based on principal components is called PrinC MHC-II-NN.</p>Process \u201cB\u201d: Determination of Peptide Binding to MHC</p>In some embodiments, the neural network described above is used to analyze all or a portion of a proteome, such as the proteome of an organism. Referring again to FIG. 1, in some embodiments, the proteome is analyzed by creating a series of N-mers for the proteome where each N-mer is offset+1 in the protein starting from the proteins' N-terminus (123456, 234567, etc.) (Step 6). Then, in some embodiments, each amino acid in each peptide is converted represented as one or more (e.g., 3 or from 1 to about 10) numbers based on the principal components (Step 7) as in Process \u201cA\u201d. Thus, each 9-mer in the proteome is represented as a vector of 27 numbers. Then, in some embodiments, by applying the prediction equations (Step 5) from Process \u201cA\u201d on the output of (7) the LN(K<sub>d</sub>) is predicted (Step 10) for all MHC binding regions for which training sets were available and that were used to \u201ctrain\u201d the NN. In some embodiments, the results of (Step 10) are stored in a database table by Genome.GI.N.C. For example, Table 6 is a statistical summary of the results for MHC_II alleles for the surface proteome (surfome) of Staphylococcus aureus COL (Genbank genome accession number=NC_002951).

    "e rise to several discoveries which suggested that it would be possible to derive a system for determining the probability of binding not only for single haplotypes, but for all combinatorial haplotypes for which a trained NN was available. The approaches outlined above make it possible to put entire proteomes (or multiple proteomes) consisting of perhaps millions of binding affinities into a single data table, in a familiar spreadsheet interface on a standard personal workstation computer (high end better, obviously). By way of example Table 6 shows various statistics derived from approximately 216,000 overlapping 15-mers comprising 648 proteins in the surface proteome (surfome) of Staphylococcus aureus COL. It should be pointed out that the absolute numbers are slightly different for the other Staph aureus strain surfomes, but the general patterns are the same and thus the statistical concepts can be inferred to apply for all strains of Staph. aureus. </p>As noted above in the discussion of the NN development, an affinity (defined experimentally as an IC<sub>50</sub>\u2014the concentration at which half the peptide can be displaced from the binding site) of 500 nM (affinity of 2\u00d710<sup>6</sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>) has been widely used to define a \u201cweak binder\u201d (WB) in immunoinformatics prediction schemes. We note that the results obtained with the Staph aureus COL surfome, the average peptide is classified in the weak binder range. A so-called \u201cstrong binder\u201d (SB) is deemed to have a dissociation constant of less than 50 nM (affinity of 2\u00d710<sup>7</sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>). As can be seen in Table 6 the SB threshold lies somewhere between the mean minus 1 standard (80.2 nM) and the 10 percentile point (44.7 nM). Since the 10 percentile was quite close to 50 nM point commonly used to conceptualize a strong binder, and it is a standard useful statistical cutoff, we selected the 10 percentile point as a useful threshold to derive the combinatorial statistics for the various MHC_II alleles. It is obvious that other thresholds could be used that would give somewhat different results.</p>In a diploid individual each presenting cell would display both parental alleles of DRB class MHC_II. There are other classes of MHC_II (DQB) and they would also contribute to the genetic diversity and binding complexity. No DQB training sets are available but it should be possible to extrapolate the general molecular concepts, should training sets become available.</p>As an example of DRB diversity based on the available training sets, Table 7 shows the predicted binding affinities for each of the DRB alleles in combination with each of the other DRB molecules (105 permutations). Inside an antigen presenting cell where peptides from digested organism (e.g. Staph. aureus COL) are coming into contact with MHC_II molecules, those molecule with higher affinity (smaller of the two LN affinity numbers) would be expected \u201cwin\u201d and thus dominate in the binding process. Obviously, if the af",

The differences shown are highly statistically significant (the diamonds are the confidence interval about the mean).</p>Comparison was complicated by the curation system at IEDB, where records are of a positive or negative response to a specific assay. Two peptides in FIG. 28 that were characterized as positive were called \u201cnegative\u201d by IEDB when performing in an experiment in which they were included under adverse conditions to define the conditions under which they normally performed as positives. Hence they were false negatives which should have been removed on curation.</p>Example 10Influenza: Comparative Analysis of Strains of Influenza Virus Isolated Over TimeThe frequent mutations in the hemagluttinin gene bring about rapid change in the surface hemagglutinin protein (HA) to which neutralizing antibodies bind. The high degree of variability of the hemagglutinin protein is well known and the constant mutation resulting in antigenic drift, allowing escape from neutralizing antibodies is an important feature of the continued transmission an"
