    " chitosan powder in 10 times of ultra-pure water, slowly dripping the astaxanthin oil ethanol solution into the stirred royal jelly peptide-galactosylated chitosan solution, heating to 60 \u2103 and reacting for 2 hours at the stirring speed of 500r/min, evaporating to remove ethanol, and freeze-drying to obtain 20g of royal jelly peptide-astaxanthin-galactosylated chitosan (RJP-AST-GC) powder.</p><p id=\"p0097\" num=\"0093\">Experiment 1: determination of DPPH free radical clarity ability of Lac Regis Apis peptide (Ala-Ser-Lys-Leu-Ala-Ile-Asp) </p><p id=\"p0098\" num=\"0094\">The Royal Jelly Peptide (RJP) and the royal jelly peptide-astaxanthin-galactosylated bacterial cellulose (RJP-AST-GBC) obtained in example 1 were weighed and a sample solution having a mass concentration of 20. Mu.g/mL was prepared. Preparing a DPPH solution with the concentration of 0.2mmol/L, and storing the solution in a dark place. 50. Mu.L of an aqueous solution of royal jelly peptide (20. Mu.g/mL) and 150. Mu.L of a DPPH solution were added to a 96-well plate, mixed well, reacted in a dark place for 30 minutes, and absorbance A1 was measured at 517 nm. Adding water and ethanol into the sample solution to make blank, and measuring absorbance A2; absolute ethanol was added to DPPH as a control and absorbance A3 was measured. The positive control used ascorbic acid. The calculation formula of the DPPH free radical clearance is as follows: DPPH radical clearance% = [1- (A1-A2)/A3 ] \u00d7100. The results show that the IC50 values of RJP, RJP-AST-GBC and ascorbic acid on DPPH free radical scavenging capacity are 8.71, 6.10 and 23.20 mug/mL respectively, which shows that the royal jelly peptide purified in the step 1 has remarkable antioxidant activity, and the antioxidant activity is not destroyed and is greatly improved after the astaxanthin is embedded by the carrier.</p><p id=\"p0099\" num=\"0095\">Experiment 2: fatty liver cell improving effect of royal jelly peptide (Ala-Ser-Lys-Leu-Ala-Ile-Asp)</p><p id=\"p0100\" num=\"0096\">HepG2 cells were cultured in high-sugar DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and placed in a 37\u2103incubator containing 5% CO 2. Setting control group, common culture medium culture (containing medium with equal concentration); culturing the model group with 0.25mmol/L palmitic acid for 24 hours, and changing the common culture medium; the royal jelly peptide group is cultured for 24 hours with 0.25mmol/L palmitic acid, and is interfered for 12 hours with 16 mug/mL royal jelly peptide solution. Adding oil red O staining solution, staining for 15min, washing with distilled water for several times, dissolving the dye in isopropanol, placing under an enzyme-labeled instrument, and measuring absorbance value D of each group at 570nm  <sub>570</sub> . The results show that the royal jelly peptide group D <sub>570</sub> (0.26.+ -. 0.05) D compared to model group <sub>570</sub> (0.52.+ -. 0.11) significantly decreased, approaching D in the blank group <sub>570</sub> (0.20"
