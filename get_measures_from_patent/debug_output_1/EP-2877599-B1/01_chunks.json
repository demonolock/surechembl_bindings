Among this large family of proteins, only five vertebrate steroid receptors are known and include the androgen receptor, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, and mineralocorticoid receptor. AR is a soluble protein that functions as an intracellular transcription factor. AR function is regulated by the binding of androgens, which initiates sequential conformational changes of the receptor that affect receptor-protein interactions and receptor-DNA interactions.</p>AR is mainly expressed in androgen target tissues, such as the prostate, skeletal muscle, liver, and central nervous system (CNS), with the highest expression level observed in the prostate, adrenal gland, and epididymis. AR in certain instance is activated by the binding of endogenous androgens, including testosterone and 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone (5\u03b1-DHT).</p>AR is a 110 kD nuclear receptor that, upon activation by androgens, mediates transcription of target genes that modulate growth and differentiation of prostate epithelial cells. AR is encoded by the AR gene located on the X chromosome at Xq11-12. The AR gene comprises 8 exons encoding the full-length androgen receptor. Similar to the other steroid receptors, unbound AR is mainly located in the cytoplasm and associated with a complex of heat shock proteins (HSPs) through interactions with the ligand-binding domain. Upon agonist binding, AR goes through a series of conformational changes: the heat shock proteins dissociate from AR, and the transformed AR undergoes dimerization, phosphorylation, and translocation to the nucleus, which is mediated by the nuclear localization signal. The translocated receptor then binds to the androgen response element (ARE), which is characterized by the two hexameric six-nucleotide half-site consensus sequence 5'-TGTTCT-3' arranged as inverted repeats spaced by three random nucleotides and is located in the promoter or enhancer region of AR gene targets. Recruitment of other transcription co-regulators (including co-activators and co-repressors) and transcriptional machinery further ensures the appropriate modulation of AR-regulated gene expression. These processes are initiated by the ligand-induced conformational changes in the ligand-binding domain.</p>AR signaling is crucial for the development and maintenance of male reproductive organs including the p",
    "an increase in or failure to repress the expression of one or more androgen repressed genes following exposure to the test compound compared to a suitable control indicates that the test compound is effective for inhibition of the mutant AR polypeptide. In some embodiments, the control is basal expression of the gene prior to exposure of the cell to the test compound. Exemplary androgen repressed genes include, but are not limited to, prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), solute carrier family 35 (SLC35F2/NOV), IGF binding protein-3 and -5, CCAAT-enhancer binding protein-\u03b4, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), IL-15, IL-18, and ERBB2/HER2.

Ki was calculated as Ki = IC50/(1 + ([<sup>3</sup>H-R1881]/Kd)), [<sup>3</sup>H-R1881] = 0.6 nM.</p>In equilibrium AR binding assays, ARN-509 and enzalutamide bound the mutant with 30 and 48-fold higher affinity, respectively (Table 8, Figure 5) (Kd for R1881: AR = 0.5 nM; AR-F877L = 0.64 nM). Thus, increased agonist activity on AR is associated with increased binding affinity to both wild-type and F876L receptor, suggesting that the agonist confirmation enables higher affinity through decreased dissociation constant.\nTable 8.CompoundAR binding, WT K<sub>i</sub> (nM)AR binding, F876L K<sub>i</sub> (nM)ARN-50918.07 \u00b1 7.460.68 \u00b1 0.15Enzalutamide26.30 \u00b1 12.770.60 \u00b10.17Bicalutamide26.56 \u00b1 12.51360.36 \u00b1 283.85Hydroxyflutamide14.56 \u00b1 8.25150.57 \u00b1 55.10Nilutamide17.74 \u00b1 5.65197.42 \u00b1 9.26</p>Example 11: Expression of AR target genes in and Proliferation of F876L stable prostate cancer cell linesAs shown above, expression of AR-F876L was sufficient to confer enzalutamide and ARN-509 resistance in transient reporter based assays. In this example, the effects of F876L on endogenous AR target genes and proliferation in prostate cancer cells stably expressing the mutant was examined.
