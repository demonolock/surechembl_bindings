M3 Receptor Radioligand Binding AssayHuman M3 receptor membranes (15 ug/well) from Perkin Elmer were incubated with 0.52 nM Scopolamine Methyl Chloride, [N-methyl-3H] with or without test compounds, or a saturating concentration of Atropine (5 \u03bcM) for the determination of non-specific binding. The assay was carried out in 96-well polypropylene plates in a volume of 250 ul. The assay buffer used was 50 mM Tris-HCl, 154 mM NaCl (pH 7.4). The final assay concentration of DMSO was 0.5% (v/v). The plates were sealed and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature on an orbital shaker (slow speed). Membranes were harvested onto 96-well unifilter GF/C filter plates pre-treated with 0.5% polyethyleneimine (v/v), using a filter manifold, washed four times with 200 \u03bcl of assay buffer. The plates were dried before addition of 50 \u03bcl of microscint-0, sealed then read in a Trilux Microbeta scintillation counter. IC50 values are determined from competition curves using a non-linear curve fitting program. Ki values were calculated from IC50 values by the Cheng and Prusoff equation.</p>The Ki values of the compounds according to the invention are less than 50 nM, most of them even less than 10 nM.</p>Example. \u03b22 Adrenoceptor Radioligand Binding AssayHuman \u03b2<sub>2 </sub>adrenoceptor membranes (7.5 ug/well) from Perkin Elmer were incubated with 0.3 nM 125-I Cyanopindolol with or without test compounds, or a saturating concentration of s-propranolol (2 \u03bcM) for the determination of non-specific binding. The assay was carried out in 96-well polypropylene plates in a volume of 200 ul. The assay buffer used was 25 mM HEPES, 0.5% BSA (w/v), 1 mM EDTA, 0.02% ascorbic acid (v/v), (pH 7.4). The final assay concentration of DMSO was 0.5% (v/v). The plates were sealed and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature on an orbital shaker (slow speed). Membranes were harvested onto 96-well unifilter GF/C filter plates pre-treated with 0.5% polyethyleneimine (v/v), using a filter manifold, washed six times with 200 \u03bcl of wash buffer containing 10 mM HEPES and 500 mM NaCl. The plates were dried before addition of 50 \u03bcl of microscint-0, sealed then read in a Trilux Microbeta scintillation counter. IC50 values are determined from competition curves using a non-linear curve fitting program.
