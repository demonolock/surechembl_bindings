Inhibitors of aberrant ALK2 signaling caused by mutant forms of ALK2 include, for example, anti-activin A antibody, ACVR2A-Fc, and ACVR2B-Fc (Hatsell et al., Sci Transl Med 2015; 7:303ra137), LDN193189 (Yu et al., Nat Med 2008; 14:1363-9), LDN212854 (Mohedas et al., ACS Chem Biol. 2013; 8:1291-1302), and anti-sense oligonucleotides against ALK2 (PLoS One 2013; 8:e69096).

    " Human ALK2This Example describes the binding affinity of anti-ALK2 antibodies to human ALK2 using bio-layer interferometry (Octet) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR/Biacore).</p>Octet Binding AnalysisThe binding of anti-ALK2 antibodies to human ALK2 ECD and absence of binding to human ALK1 ECD was verified by bio-layer interferometry using an Octet HTX instrument (ForteBio).</p>ALK2-Fc (R&amp;D Systems), ALK2-Fc (Sino Biological catalog number 10227-H03H), and ALK1-Fc (R&amp;D Systems catalog number 370-AL-100) were diluted to 10 \u03bcg/mL in 1\u00d7 kinetics buffer (ForteBio) and loaded onto anti-human Fc tips (ForteBio). After baseline equilibration in kinetics buffer (ForteBio), the sensors were applied to solutions of antibodies JAB0399, JAB0481, and BB5.1 (isotype control mAb) diluted to 10 \u03bcg/ml in kinetics buffer. The sensors were then applied to antibody-free kinetics buffer to measure antibody dissociation.</p>A summary of the parameters used to assess binding is provided below:</p>1. Baseline: 1\u00d7KB, 30 seconds\n\n2. Loading: Antigens in 1\u00d7KB, 300 seconds\n\n3. Baseline: 1\u00d7KB, 30 seconds\n\n4. Association: mAb in 1\u00d7KB, 300 seconds\n\n5. Dissociation: 1\u00d7KB, 300 seconds\n</p>As shown in FIG. 7 and FIG. 8, JAB0399 and JAB0481 show specificity of binding. Both mAbs bound to the ALK2 ECD Fc fusions obtained from two different commercial sources, but did not bind to the paralog ALK1. Non-specific binding to the sensor was not observed.</p>Biacore AnalysisThe binding kinetics and affinity dissociation constant for antibody JAB0481 binding the extracellular domain of ALK2 (amino acids 1-123 of the mature ALK2 protein; Creative Biomart catalog number ACVR1-01H) was determined by surface plasmon resonance using a Biacore instrument (GE Lifesciences).</p>Anti-mouse IgG was immobilized on carboxymethylated dextran BiaCore sensor chips (CMS, GE Biosciences) using a Mouse Antibody Capture Kit (GE Lifesciences product number BR100838). Two sensors were prepared; one for a \u201clow\u201d density of JAB0481 captured on the sensor and one with a \u201chigh\u201d density of JAB0481 captured on the sensor. JAB0481 was diluted to 0.05 mg/ml in HEPES EDTA surfactant buffer (HBS-EP), pH 7.4 and injected onto the mouse antibody capture sensors. The volume of JAB0481 solution injected for the \u201clow\u201d density condition was 104, and the volume that was used for the \u201chigh\u201d density condition was 30 \u03bcL.</p>The ALK2 ECD was diluted in HBS-EP buffer and injected over the JAB0481 captured sensors at concentrations ranging from 2000 nM to 250 nM followed by a 300 second association period. This was followed by the injection of HBS-EP buffer and a 500 second dissociation period. Relative response deflection was plotted against time and the data were fitted to curves according to the Langmuir 1:1 binding kinetic model.</p>The sensorgrams for the binding of the ALK2 ECD to JAB0481 at low surface density is provided in FIG. 9, while the sensorgrams for the binding of the ALK2 ECD to JAB0481 at high surface density is provided in FIG. 10. Table 2 provides the association and dissociation rates, the dissociation constant, and Chi squared values calculated from the Biacore binding data. The dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) determined for binding of JAB0481 to recombinant human ALK2 ECD was determined to be 155 nM when measured with the low density JAB0481 sensor and to be 72.7 nM when measured with the high density JAB0481 sensor.</p>TABLE 2SPR binding of antibody JAB0481 to recombinant ALK2 ECDSurfacemAbDensityAntigenk<sub>a </sub>(1/Ms)k<sub>d </sub>(1/s)K<sub>D </sub>(M)Chi<sup>2</sup>JAB0481LowACVR15.36 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup>8.33 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22123</sup>1.55 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22127</sup>1.74ECDJAB0481HighACVR16.42 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup>4.67 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22123</sup>7.27 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22128</sup>10.1ECD</p>Example 5: Binding of Anti-ALK2 Antibodies to ALK2 Expressed on CellsAnti-ALK2 antibodies were evaluated for binding to ALK2 expressed on the cell surface of mouse myoblast cells (C2C12; ATCC CRL-1772) by flow cytometry. The expression of ALK2 in wild-type C2C12 cells was confirmed by RT-qPCR and by observing the binding of commercially available polyclonal anti-ALK2 antibodies to the cells by flow cytometry (data not shown). To demonstrate specificity, the antibodies were also tested for binding to ALK2 knock-out C2C12 cells in which the ACVR1 alleles were deleted using CRISPR/Cas9 technology (PNA Bio).
