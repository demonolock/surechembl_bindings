    "ds specifically to an antigen and comprises at least two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains interconnected by disulfide bonds, or an antigen-binding portion thereof. Each H chain comprises a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as V<sub>H</sub>) and a heavy chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region comprises three domains, C<sub>H1</sub>, C<sub>H2 </sub>and C<sub>H3</sub>. Each light chain is comprised of a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as V<sub>L</sub>) and a light chain constant region. The light chain constant region is comprised of one domain, C<sub>L</sub>. The V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions (CDRs), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>is composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. The variable regions of the heavy and light chains contain a binding domain that interacts with an antigen. The constant regions of the antibodies may mediate the binding of the immunoglobulin to host tissues or factors, including various cells of the immune system (e.g., effector cells) and the first component (C1q) of the classical complement system.</p>Antibodies typically bind specifically to their cognate antigen with high affinity, reflected by a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>\u22125 </sup>to 10<sup>\u221211 </sup>M<sup>\u22121 </sup>or less. Any K<sub>D </sub>greater than about 10<sup>\u22124 </sup>M<sup>\u22121 </sup>is generally considered to indicate nonspecific binding. As used herein, an antibody that \u201cbinds specifically\u201d to an antigen refers to an antibody that binds to the antigen and substantially identical antigens with high affinity, which means having a K<sub>D </sub>of 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>M or less, preferably 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M or less, even more preferably 5\u00d710<sup>\u22129 </sup>M or less, and most preferably between 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M and 10<sup>\u221210 </sup>M or less, but does not bind with high affinity to unrelated antigens. An antigen is \u201csubstantially identical\u201d to a given antigen if it exhibits a high degree of sequence identity to the given antigen, for example, if it exhibits at least 80%, at least 90%, preferably at least 95%, more preferably at least 97%, or even more preferably at least 99 sequence identity to the sequence of the given antigen. By way of example, an antibody that binds specifically to human CXCR4 may also have cross-reactivity with CXCR4 antigens from certain primate species but may not cross-react with CXCR4 antigens from certain rodent species or with an antigen other than CXCR4, e.g., a human PD-L1 antigen.</p>The immunoglobulin may derive from any of the commonly known isotypes, including but not limited to IgA, secretory IgA, IgG and IgM.

See FIG. 4. No binding to the R1610 parental cells was detected. Based upon geometric mean fluorescent intensity (GMFI), CXCR4 levels were highest on R1610-huCXCR4 and Ramos cells followed by CEM (FIG. 4B), Nomo-1 and HL60 (FIG. 4A). The multiple myeloma cell lines MOLP-8 and JJN-3R expressed the lowest number of receptors (FIG. 4C). The EC<sub>50 </sub>values for binding are shown in Table 2. In addition, BMS-936564 bound to healthy donor PBMCs (data not shown) as well as 7/8 PBMCs samples collected from AML patients with variable GMFI (FIG. 4D). These data indicate that CXCR4 is expressed on multiple hematopoietic cell lines and variably expressed in AML patients.</p>TABLE 2Binding of BMS-936564 Binding to Human CXCR4<sup>+</sup> Cell LinesCell TypeEC<sub>50 </sub>(nM)R1610-huCXCR42.3Ramos4.2CEM10.3Nomo-140HL-605.3MOLP-86.5JJN-3R2.0</p>Example 4Inhibition of CXCL12 Binding to CXCR4 by Anti-CXCR4 and Anti-CXCL12 AntibodiesTo determine the ability of the anti-CXCR4 human antibodies to inhibit the binding of CXCL12 to CXCR4, a competition study was performed using <sup>125</sup>I-labeled CXCL12 (PerkinElmer, Waltham, Mass.) and CEM cells, which naturally express CXCR4. A comparison of anti-CXCR4 antibodies on blocking CXCL12 binding to CEM cells was performed by a standard radio-labeled ligand binding assay. The anti-CXCR4 antibodies were serially diluted 1:3 to yield a range of concentrations from 300 nM to 137 pM. The antibodies were added to 750,000 CEM cells in 100 \u03bcl in the presence of 100 pM <sup>125</sup>I-CXCL12 with a specific activity of 2000 Ci/mmole (Amersham, catalog #IM314-25UCI). An irrelevant antibody of the same isotype was used as a negative control. The total possible bound radio-labeled ligand was determined by allowing the <sup>125</sup>I-CXCL12 to bind to CEM cells in the absence of antibodies for 2 hours at 4\u00b0 C. Non-specific binding of the radio-labeled ligand was determined by allowing the <sup>125</sup>I-CXCL12 to bind in the presence of 1 \u03bcM unlabeled CXCL12 (Peprotech, catalog #300-28A). The amount of cell-associated <sup>125</sup>I-CXCL12 was determined by standard methods. The results are shown in FIG. 5, which demonstrates that the F7 antibody (BMS-936564) provides the most effective blockade of CXCL12 binding to CXCR4 expressed on CEM cells. The F9 and D1 antibodies also blocked CXCL12 binding, although more moderately than F7. The E2 antibody, although it does bind to CXCR4 on CEM cells (as demonstrated in Example 3), did not effectively block CXCL12 binding to CXCR4 on CEM cells. The EC<sub>50</sub>'s for CXCL12 blockade by F7, F9 and D1 were 2.3 nM, 12.5 nM and 28.6 nM, respectively.</p>In another experiment, the blockade of binding of CXCL12 to CXCR4 by BMS-936564 and an anti-CXCL12 antibody was compared. Serial dilutions of BMS-",
    "sults demonstrated that antibodies F7 and F9 inhibited migration effectively, while antibodies D1 and E2 did not significantly inhibit migration. The EC<sub>50</sub>'s for inhibition of CXCL12-induced CEM cell migration by F7 and F9 were 12.44 nM and 18.99 nM, respectively.</p>In another experiment, the ability of BMS-936564 and anti-CXCL12 to inhibit CXCL12-induced migration of Ramos and CEM cells was compared. Cells were loaded with BATDA. A fixed concentration of CXCL12 was used to stimulate migration of cells through a filter containing 5 \u03bcm pores on Migration Plates from Neuro Probe (Gaithersburg, Md.). A titration of BMS-936564 or anti-CXCL12 from 20 pM to 300 nM was added to the cells. CXCL12 without antibody was used to establish maximal migration. Migration toward media alone without CXCL12 was used to measure background migration. Following a 2-hour incubation at 37\u00b0 C., migrated cells were detected by addition of DELFIA\u00ae Europium solution (Perkin Elmer) to the lysed cells and detected by time resolved fluorescence on the Fusion instrument. The optimal concentration of CXCL12 for inducing Ramos migration was established to be 10 ng/mL (1.25 nM) while CEM cells were more sensitive to CXCL12 and exhibited maximal migration at 0.05 nM CXCL12. BMS-936564 was shown to block CXCL12-induced migration with an approximate EC<sub>50 </sub>value of 1 nM in Ramos cells and 4 nM in CEM cells (FIGS. 10A and 10B). Anti-CXCL12 inhibited CXCL12-induced migration with an approximate EC50 value of 0.9 nM (Ramos) and 0.13 nM (CEM) cells (FIGS. 10A and 10B).</p>Example 7Inhibition of HuVEC Capillary Tube Formation by Anti-CXCR4 AntibodiesIn this example, the ability of the anti-CXCR4 human antibodies to inhibit capillary tube formation by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HuVEC) was examined MATRIGEL\u00ae was diluted 1:1 with RPMI and plated onto the wells of a 96 well plate and allowed to polymerize for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. HuVEC (from Cambrex, cat. # CC-2519) at 80% confluence were trypsinized and resuspended at 1\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>cells per ml in RPMI with 0.5% FBS. Antibodies were well mixed with HuVEC at a final concentration of 3 mg/ml and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes. An irrelevant antibody of the same isotype or media alone was used as a negative control. As a positive control of inhibition of tube formation, a mouse anti-human \u03b1v\u03b23 (CD51/CD61) antibody (R&amp;D Systems, cat. # MAB3050) was used. HuVEC with or without antibodies were plated onto the MATRIGEL\u00ae-coated wells and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 18 hours.</p>The HuVEC incubated with media alone or with the isotype-matched control antibody formed capillary tubes resulting in the appearance of connected cells across the plate with 3-5 points of connection or branch points per cell. The HuVEC incubated with either the anti-CXCR4 human antibodies or the anti-\u03b1v\u03b23 antibody did not form capillary tubes. The cells appeared isolated and with few or no branch points.
