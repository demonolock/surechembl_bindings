Types of pharmaceutical compositions that may be used include but are not limited to tablets, chewable tablets, capsules, solutions, parenteral solutions, suppositories, suspensions, and other types disclosed herein or apparent to a person skilled in the art from the specification and general knowledge in the art. In embodiments of the invention, a pharmaceutical pack or kit is provided comprising one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of a pharmaceutical composition of the invention. Associated with such container(s) can be various written materials such as instructions for use, or a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceuticals products, which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture, use, or sale for human or veterinary administration.</p>PHARMACOLOGICAL METHODSIn vitro affinity for dopamine-D<sub>2</sub> receptorsAffinity of the compounds for dopamine-D<sub>2</sub> receptor s was determined using the receptor binding assay described by I. Creese, R. Schneider and S.H. Snyder: \"[3H]-Spiroperidol labels dopamine receptors in rat pituitary and brain\", Eur.J.Pharmacol., 46, 377 - 381, 1977.</p>In vitro affinity for serotonin reuptake sitesAffinity of the compounds for serotonin reuptake sites was determined using the receptor binding assay described by E. Habert et al.,: \"Characterisation of [3H]-paroxetine binding to rat cortical membranes\", Eur.J.Pharmacol., 118, 107-114, 1985.</p>Inhibition of forskolin-induced [<sup>3</sup>H]-cAMP accumulationThe in vitro functional activity at dopamine-D<sub>2</sub> receptors, including the intrinsic activity (\u03b5) of the compounds of the invention was measured by their ability to inhibit forskolin-induced [<sup>3</sup>H]-cAMP accumulation.</p>Human dopamine D<sub>2,L</sub> receptors were cloned in fibroblast cell line CHO-K1 cells and obtained from Dr. Grandy, Vollum Institute, Portland, Oregon, USA. CHO cells were grown in a Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) culture medium, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 1 mM pyruvate, 5000 units/ml penicillin, 5000 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin and 200 \u00b5g/ml G-418 at 37 \u00b0C in 93% air/7% CO<sub>2</sub>. For incubation with test compounds, confluent cultures grown in 24 wells plates were used. Each condition or substance was routinely tested in quadruplicate. Cells were loaded with 1 \u00b5Ci [<sup>3</sup>H]-adenine in 0.5 ml medium/well. After 2 hours, cultures were washed with 0.5 ml PBS containing 1 mM of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) and incubated for 20 min with 0.5 ml PBS containing 1 mM IBMX and forskolin with or without test compound. After aspiration the reaction was stopped with 1 ml trichloroacetic acid 5% (w/v). The [<sup>3</sup>H]-ATP and [<sup>3</s",

The dosage expediently administered is 0.001 - 1000 mg/kg, preferably 0.1-100 mg/kg of patient's bodyweight.</p>TREATMENTThe term 'treatment' as used herein refers to any treatme nt of a mammalian, preferably human condition or disease, and includes: (1) preventing the disease or condition from occurring in a subject which may be predisposed to the disease but has not yet been diagnosed as having it, (2) inhibiting the disease or condition, i.e., arresting its development, (3) relieving the disease or condition, i.e., causing regression of the condition, or (4) relieving the conditions caused by the disease, i.e., stopping the symptoms of the disease.</p>The preparation of the compounds having formula (I) will now be described in more detail in the following Examples.</p>EXAMPLESThe H-atom of the N-H moiety of amines I-H to V-H can be replaced by Q in two different chemical ways, A and B, eventually leading to the compounds of the invention which are listed in Table 1 (see below).</p>Method A:<img id=\"ib0004\" path=\"imgb0004.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/48461784/EP/20080723/B1/000001/82/74/27/imgb0004.tif\"/></p>The compounds were prepared via the synthesis depicted in scheme A1: an amine (one of the five I-H to V-H, structures given below) was reacted with Q-X (X = leaving group like e.g. Cl, Br, I) in e.g. acetonitrile or butyronitrile with Et(i-Pr)<sub>2</sub>N acting as a base, in some cases KI (or Nal) was added. Et<sub>3</sub>N can be used instead of Et(i-Pr)<sub>2</sub>N.</p>Example 1:<img id=\"ib0005\" path=\"imgb0005.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/48461650/EP/20080723/B1/000001/82/74/27/imgb0005.tif\"/></p>Scheme A2, step i:A mixture of 0.8 g. (3.27 mmol) amine III-H.HCl, 1.13 g (3.65 mmol) iodide and 2.31 ml (12.7mmol) diisopropylethylamine in 140 ml of butyronitril was heated at reflux temperature for 22 hours. The reaction mixture was allowed to reach room temperature and after concentration in vacuo, the residu was purified by flash column chromatography (SiO<sub>2</sub>, eluent: ethylacetate /methanol/ammonia 92/7.5/0.5 v/v/v). The product containing fractions were concentrated in vacuo and the residue was suspended and stirred in diisopropylether. The resulting solid was isolated by filtration.Yield 0.71 g (55 %). M.p. 62-5 \u00b0C.</p>Method B:The compounds were prepared via the synthesis depicted in scheme B1: an amine (one of the five I-H to V-H, structures given below) was alkylated by means of a reductive alkylation. Q-OH was oxidized to the corresponding aldehyde Q'-CHO after which the reductive alkylation was performed. THF and DCE are suitable solvents for this type of reaction.\n<img id=\"ib0006\" path=\"imgb0006.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/48461773/EP/20080723/B1/000001/82/74/27/imgb0006.tif\"/></p>Example 2:<img id=\"ib0007\" path=\"imgb0007.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/48461865/"
