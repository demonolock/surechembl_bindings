    "ptor or NEP enzyme plays a role. Any suitable biological system or sample having AT<sub>1 </sub>receptors and/or a NEP enzyme may be employed in such studies which may be conducted either in vitro or in vivo. Representative biological systems or samples suitable for such studies include, but are not limited to, cells, cellular extracts, plasma membranes, tissue samples, isolated organs, mammals (such as mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, dogs, pigs, humans, and so forth), and the like, with mammals being of particular interest. In one particular embodiment of the invention an AT<sub>1 </sub>receptor in a mammal is antagonized by administering an AT<sub>1</sub>-antagonizing amount of the crystalline compound. In another particular embodiment, NEP enzyme activity in a mammal is inhibited by administering a NEP-inhibiting amount of the crystalline compound. The crystalline compound can also be used as a research tool by conducting biological assays using such compound.</p>When used as a research tool, a biological system or sample comprising an AT<sub>1 </sub>receptor and/or a NEP enzyme is typically contacted with an AT<sub>1 </sub>receptor-antagonizing or NEP enzyme-inhibiting amount of the crystalline compound. After the biological system or sample is exposed to the crystalline compound, the effects of antagonizing the AT<sub>1 </sub>receptor and/or inhibiting the NEP enzyme are determined using conventional procedures and equipment, such as by measuring receptor binding in a binding assay or measuring ligand-mediated changes in a functional assay. Exposure encompasses contacting cells or tissue with the compound, administering the compound to a mammal, for example by i.p., i.v. or s.c. administration, and so forth. This determining step can involve measuring a response (a quantitative analysis) or can involve making an observation (a qualitative analysis). Measuring a response involves, for example, determining the effects of the crystalline compound on the biological system or sample using conventional procedures and equipment, such as radioligand binding assays and measuring ligand-mediated changes in functional assays. The assay results can be used to determine the activity level as well as the amount of compound necessary to achieve the desired result, that is, an AT<sub>1 </sub>receptor-antagonizing and/or a NEP enzyme-inhibiting amount. Typically, the determining step will involve determining the AT<sub>1 </sub>receptor ligand-mediated effects and/or determining the effects of inhibiting the NEP enzyme.</p>Additionally, the crystalline compound of the invention can be used as a research tool for evaluating other chemical compounds, and thus are also useful in screening assays to discover, for example, new compounds having AT<sub>1 </sub>receptor-antagonizing activity and/or NEP-inhibiting activity. In this manner, the crystalline compound is used as a standard in an assay to allow comparison of the results obtained with a test compound and with the crystalline compound to identify those test compounds that have about equal or superior activity, if any. For example, K<sub>i </sub>data (as determined, for example, by a binding assay) for a test compound or a group of test compounds is compared to the K<sub>i </sub>data for the crystalline compound of the invention to identify those test compounds that have the desired properties, for example, test compounds having a K<sub>i </sub>value about equal or superior to a compound of the invention, if any. This aspect of the invention includes, as separate embodiments, both the generation of comparison data (using the appropriate assays) and the analysis of test data to identify test compounds of interest. Thus, a test compound can be evaluated in a biological assay, by a method comprising the steps of: (a) conducting a biological assay with a test compound to provide a first assay value; (b) conducting the biological assay with a compound of the invention to provide a second assay value; wherein step (a) is conducted either before, after or concurrently with step (b); and (c) comparing the first assay value from step (a) with the second assay value from step (b). Exemplary biological assays include an AT<sub>1 </sub>receptor binding assay and a NEP enzyme inhibition assay.</p>Pharmaceutical Compositions and FormulationsThe crystalline compound of formula I is typically administered to a patient in the form of a pharmaceutical composition or formulation. Such pharmaceutical compositions may be administered to the patient by any acceptable route of administration including, but not limited to, oral, rectal, vaginal, nasal, inhaled, topical (including transdermal), ocular, and parenteral modes of administration. Further, the compounds of the invention may be administered, for example orally, in multiple doses per day (for example, two, three, or four times daily), in a single daily dose or a single weekly dose. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that, once the crystalline compound of the invention has been formulated, it may no longer be in crystalline form, i.e., the crystalline compound may be dissolved in a suitable carrier.</p>Accordingly, in one embodiment, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a crystalline form of 4\u2032-{2-ethoxy-4-ethyl-5-[((S)-2-mercapto-4-methylpentanoylamino)methyl]imidazol-1-ylmethyl}-3\u2032-fluorobiphenyl-2-carboxylic acid. Such pharmaceutical compositions may also contain other therapeutic and/or formulating agents if desired. When discussing compositions, the \u201ccrystalline compound of the invention\u201d may also be referred to herein as the \u201cactive agent\u201d to distinguish it from other components of",
    "man AT<sub>1 </sub>or AT<sub>2 </sub>receptors, respectively, were grown in HAM's-F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 \u03bcg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 500 \u03bcg/ml geneticin in a 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>humidified incubator at 37\u00b0 C. AT<sub>2 </sub>receptor expressing cells were grown in the additional presence of 100 nM PD123,319 (AT<sub>2 </sub>antagonist). When cultures reached 80-95% confluence, the cells were washed thoroughly in PBS and lifted with 5 mM EDTA. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and snap frozen in MeOH-dry ice and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. until further use.</p>For membrane preparation, cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5 at 4\u00b0 C., 1 mM EDTA, and one tablet of Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablets with 2 mM EDTA per 50 mL buffer (Roche cat. #1697498, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, Ind.)) and homogenized using a tight-fitting Dounce glass homogenizer (10 strokes) on ice. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000\u00d7g, the supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 20,000\u00d7g. The final pellet was resuspended in membrane buffer (75 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 12.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.3 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 250 mM sucrose at 4\u00b0 C.) and homogenized by extrusion through a 20G gauge needle. Protein concentration of the membrane suspension was determined by the method described in Bradford (1976) Anal Biochem. 72:248-54. Membranes were snap frozen in MeOH-dry ice and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. until further use.</p>Ligand Binding Assay to Determine Compound Affinities for the Human AT<sub>1 </sub>and AT<sub>2 </sub>Angiotensin ReceptorsBinding assays were performed in 96-well Acrowell filter plates (Pall Inc., cat. #5020) in a total assay volume of 100 \u03bcL with 0.2 \u03bcg membrane protein for membranes containing the human AT<sub>1 </sub>receptor, or 2 \u03bcg membrane protein for membranes containing the human AT<sub>2 </sub>receptor in assay buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5 at 20\u00b0 C., 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 \u03bcM EDTA, 0.025% BSA). Saturation binding studies for determination of K<sub>d </sub>values of the ligand were done using N-terminally Europium-labeled angiotensin-II ([Eu]AngII, H-(Eu\u2014N<sup>1</sup>)-Ahx-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe-OH; PerkinElmer, Boston, Mass.) at 8 different concentrations ranging from 0.1 nM to 30 nM. Displacement assays for determination of pK<sub>a </sub>values of test compounds were done with [Eu]AngII at 2 nM and 11 different concentrations of drug ranging from 1 pM to 10 \u03bcm. Drugs were dissolved to a concentration of 1 mM in DMSO and from there serially diluted into assay buffer. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 10 \u03bcM unlabeled angiotensin-II. Assays were incubated for 120 minutes in the dark, at room temperature or 37\u00b0 C., and binding reactions were terminated by rapid filtration through the Acrowell filter plates followed by three washes with 200 \u03bcL, ice cold wash buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5 at 4\u00b0 C., 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) using a Waters filtr"
