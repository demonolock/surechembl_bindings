{"raw_mentions": "AT\u2082 receptor expressing cells were grown in the additional presence of 100 nM PD123,319 (AT\u2082 antagonist).\nSaturation binding studies for determination of Kd values of the ligand were done using N-terminally Europium-labeled angiotensin-II ([Eu]AngII, H-(Eu\u2014N\u00b9)-Ahx-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe-OH; PerkinElmer, Boston, Mass.) at 8 different concentrations ranging from 0.1 nM to 30 nM.\nDisplacement assays for determination of pKa values of test compounds were done with [Eu]AngII at 2 nM and 11 different concentrations of drug ranging from 1 pM to 10 \u03bcm.\nNon-specific binding was determined in the presence of 10 \u03bcM unlabeled angiotensin-II."}
