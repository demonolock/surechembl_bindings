    "s-oxide and thioxetanyl-s,s-dioxide. Examples of 5-membered heterocyclyl groups in this instance include dioxalanyl, pyrrolidinyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, tetrahydrothiophenyl, tetrahydrothiophenyl-s-oxide and tetrahydrothiophenyl-s,s-dioxide. Examples of 6-membered heterocyclyl groups are morpholinyl, piperidinyl, piperazinyl, tetrahydropyranyl, tetrahydrothiopyranyl, tetrahydrothiopyranyl-s-dioxide, tetrahydrothiopyranyl-s,s-dioxide, thiomorpholinyl, thiomorpholinyl-s,s-dioxide, tetrahydropyridinyl dioxanyl, and tetrahydro-thiopyran 1,1 dioxide. Examples of a 7-membered heterocyclyl ring are azapine or oxapine. Examples of 8-membered groups are azacyclooctanyl, azaoxacyclooctanyl or azathiacyclooctanyl, oxacylcooctanyl, or thiacyclooctanyl.</p>When R<sup>3 </sup>is an unsubstituted or substituted aromatic heterocyclyl group, the ring may contain 1, 2, 3, or 4 hetero atoms. In one embodiment the hetero atoms are selected from oxygen, nitrogen or sulphur. Examples of 5-membered heterocyclyl groups in this instance include furanyl, dioxalanyl, pyrrolyl, oxazolyl, thiazolyl, imidazolyl, oxadiazolyl, thiadiazolyl, triazolyl, triazinyl, isothiazolyl, isoxazolyl, thienyl, pyrazolyl or tetrazolyl. Examples of 6-membered heterocyclyl groups are pyridinyl, pyrizinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl, triazinyl, or tetrazinyl.</p>In one embodiment the compounds of formula (I) are selective for CB2 over CB1. In one embodiment the compounds are 100 fold selective i.e. compounds of formula (I) have an EC50 value at the cloned human cannabinoid CB2 receptor of at least 100 times the EC50 values at the cloned human cannabinoid CB 1 receptor or have less than 10% efficacy at the CB1 receptor. The invention is described using the following definitions unless otherwise indicated.</p>The term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable-derivative\u201d means any pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, salt of such ester or solvate of the compounds of formula (I), or any other compound which upon administration to the recipient is capable of providing (directly or indirectly) a compound of formula (I) or an active metabolite or residue thereof.</p>It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that compounds of formula (I) may be modified to provide pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof at any of the functional groups in the compounds, and that the compounds of formula (I) may be derivatised at more than one position.</p>It will be appreciated that, for pharmaceutical use, the salts referred to above will be physiologically acceptable salts, but other salts may find use, for example in the preparation of compounds of formula (I) and the physiological acceptable salts thereof. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those described by Berge, Bighley and Monkhouse, J. Pharm. Sci., 1977, 66, 1-19. The term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salts\u201d includes salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases including inorganic bases and organic bases. Salts derived from inorganic bases include aluminum, ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magn"
