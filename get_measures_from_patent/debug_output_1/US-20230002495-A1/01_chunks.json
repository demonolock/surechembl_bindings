Included within the definition of \u201cantigen\u201d is a protein-encoding nucleic acid. An \u201cantigen\u201d can also refer to the binding partner of an antibody. In some embodiments, the antigen is the IGF-1R protein expressed on the surface of a cell. In some embodiments, the cell is an intact cell. An intact cell is a cell that has not been lysed or broken open with the use of detergents or other reagents. A cell that has been treated with detergents or other reagents that breaks up the cellular membrane or punches holes in a cellular membrane is not an intact cell. For example, methods are provided herein for generating an antibody that binds to a IGF-1R protein, the method comprising culturing a cell comprising a nucleic acid molecule encoding the IGF-1R antibody.</p>As used herein, \u201cspecific binding\u201d or \u201cimmunospecific binding\u201d or \u201cbinds immunospecifically\u201d refer to antibody binding to a predetermined antigen (e.g. IGF-1R) or epitope present on the antigen. In some embodiments, the antibody binds with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>M or less, and binds to the predetermined antigen with a K<sub>D </sub>that is at least two-fold less than its K<sub>D </sub>for binding to a non-specific antigen (e.g., BSA, casein, or another non-specific polypeptide) other than the predetermined antigen. The phrases \u201can antibody recognizing IGF-1R \u201d and \u201can antibody specific for IGF-1R\u201d are used interchangeably herein with the term \u201can antibody which binds immunospecifically to IGF-1R.\u201d Reference in the present disclosure may be made to IGF-1R. The degree of specificity necessary for an anti-IGF-1R antibody may depend on the intended use of the antibody, and at any rate is defined by its suitability for use for an intended purpose. In some embodiments, the antibody, or binding compound derived from the antigen-binding site of an antibody, of the contemplated method binds to its antigen (IGF-1R), with an affinity that is at least two fold greater, at least ten times greater, at least 20-times greater, or at least 100-times greater than the affinity with any other antigen.</p>Methods for determining mAb specificity and affinity by competitive inhibition can be found in Harlow, et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1988), Colligan et al., eds., Current Protocols in Immunology, Greene Publishing Assoc. and Wiley Interscience, N.Y., (1992, 1993), and Muller, Meth.

Teprotumumab was also administered at 10 mg/kg IV as a comparator. The results illustrated in FIG. 1 demonstrate that the antibody had a significantly higher PK as compared to Teprotumumab.</p>This result demonstrates an antibody comprising the CDRs of VRDN-2700 can likely be given at a lower dose as compared to Teprotumumab, even when administered subcutaneously. These results could not have been predicted.</p>Example 4VRDN-1100 is an antagonist antibody to insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) under development for treatment of Thyroid Eye Disease (TED). TED is driven by Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Receptor (TSHR) agonistic autoantibodies and crosstalk between TSHR and IGF-1R. TED is characterized by recruitment of fibrocytes that express IGF-1R and TSHR in orbital tissues, where they mediate deposition of hyaluronan and expansion of orbital muscle and fatl. IGF-1R antagonism has been found to reverse this orbital tissue expansion and robustly relieve symptoms in TED patients2.</p>VRDN-1100 is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting IGF-1R. The IGF-1R binding and antagonist characteristics of VRDN-1100 was analyzed.</p>Methods</p>Surface plasmon resonance (SPR): Antibodies were captured by immobilized anti-Fc, and recombinant IGF-1R extracellular domain (ECD) was flowed as analyte. Association and dissociation rate constants (ka and kd, respectively), and equilibrium dissociation constant KD were derived by global fit of data to single site model.</p>Epitope binning: VRDN-1100 was immobilized on a chip surface by amine coupling and used to capture IGF-1R-ECD, after which teprotumumab was flowed over the chip.</p>Cell binding: A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells or primary human ocular choroid fibroblasts (HOCF) were incubated with varying concentrations of VRDN-1100 or teprotumumab. A single dose 50 nM IgG1 isotype control was used as negative control. Unbound antibody was removed by washing, and the cells were incubated with an Alexa Fluor 488-goat anti-human antibody and a cell impermeable dye to gate live cells. The median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of viable cells was measured by flow cytometry and the data were analyzed using FlowJo software. Dose curves were fitted using a non-linear regression model; log(agonist) vs response-variable slope (four parameters).</p>Internalization: Cells were incubated with various concentrations of antibodies of interest at 4\u00b0 C. and 37\u00b0 C. for 60 minutes. Cells were then washed 3\u00d7 and incubated with FITC-labeled goat anti-human Fc secondary antibody for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. The MFI of viable cells was measured by flow cytometry and the data were analyzed using FlowJo software.</p>Cell surface marker expression: HOCF cells were incubated with directly labeled antibodies or IgG isotype control at 10 ug/mL.

Phosphorylated IGF-1R (pIGF1R) of biological duplicates was measured using the R&amp;D Systems pIGF-1R ELISA according to the manufacturer's protocol and pIGF-1R concentrations were normalized to the lowest test antibody concentration. Dose curves were fit using a non-linear regression model; log(inhibitor) vs response-variable slope (four parameters)).</p>Results</p>VRDN-1100 Binds IGF-1R With Sub-Nanomolar Affinity. FIG. 2A illustrates that increasing concentrations of IGF-1R-ECD bound to anti-FC captured VRDN-1100 or teprotumumab reveal a stepwise increase in SPR signal, enabling a global fit to a binding model. Following IGF-1R washout, VRDN-1100 shows a more sustained binding interaction. FIG. 2B illustrates IGF-1R-ECD bound robustly to immobilized VRDN-1100. Teprotumumab showed no binding to the IGF-1R:VRDN-1100 complex, suggesting that teprotumumab and VRDN-1100 have overlapping epitopes. The data is also illustrated in the table as shown in FIG. 2B.</p>VRDN-1100 Binds With High Affinity To IGF-1R On A549 Cells. As illustrated in FIG. 3A-C, VRDN-1100 binding to A549 cells was assessed by flow cytometry and found to have similar binding distribution as teprotumumab at three different concentrations. As also illustrated in FIG. 3D, in, the binding dose response curve demonstrated VRDN-1100 EC50=0.1 nM. As illustrated in FIG. 3E-F, VRDN-1100, VRDN-2700 with M252Y, S254T, and T256E mutation in the Fc domain, and teprotumumab show comparable binding at temperatures that block IGF-1R receptor internalization. FIG. 3F illustrates that VRDN-1100, VRDN-2700 with a M252Y, S254T, and T256E mutation in the Fc domain, and teprotumumab cause comparable levels of internalization (\u02dc50%) measured by reduction in membrane IGF-1R receptor levels at 37\u00b0 C. vs 4\u00b0 C. In FIG. 3E-F bar graphs the left most bars are the isotype control, the second to left set of bars are teprotumumab, the second from the right set of bars are VRDN-1100 and the right most set of bars are VRDN-2700.</p>HOCFs as an In Vitro Model for TED Pathology.</p>CD34+, Thy-1+ orbital fibroblasts are implicated in extracellular matrix deposition and pathogenic fibrosis in TED5. As illustrated in FIG. 4A-C, HOFCs were shown to express (Panel A) IGF-1R and (Panel B) TSHR, as well as (Panel C) CD34 and Thy-1, which demonstrates their ability to be used as an in vitro model system for IGF-1R function in TED.</p>VRDN-1100 Binds with High Affinity to IGF-1R on HOCF Cells.</p>FIG. 5A and FIG. 5B illustrate VRDN-1100 binding to HOCF cells, which was assessed by flow cytometry and found to have largely similar binding as teprotumumab at three different concentrations. The lower panel of FIG. 5B illustrates a binding dose response curve, which demonstrated VRDN-1100 having an EC50=0.4 nM.</p>VRDN-1100 Is A Sub-Nanomolar IGF-1R Antagonist. VRDN-1100 potently inhibits IGF-1 stimulated receptor phosphorylation on A549 cells (IC50=0.09 nM) and HOCF cells (IC50=0.09 nM), which is illustrated in FIG. 6A and FIG. 6B.</p>These results demonstrate that VRDN-1100 and teprotumumab epitopes on IGF-1R overlap, that VRDN-1100 binds to IGF-1R on cells with sub-nanomolar EC50, VRDN-1100 promotes IGF-1R internalization, and that VRDN-1100 inhibits IGF-1R phosphorylation with sub-nanomolar IC50. Accordingly, VRDN-1100 binds, antagonizes, and internalizes IGF-1R at sub-nanomolar concentrations, suggesting that VRDN-1100 should be a able to be used for the potential, potent inhibition of the pathophysiology driving TED.</p>EXAMPLE 4. VRDN-2700, which has a M252Y, S254T, and T256E mutation in the Fc domain is a novel anti-IGF-1R antibody incorporating half-life extension modifications in its Fc region as described herein and can be used for the treatment of Thyroid Eye Disease (TED). The pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of VRDN-2700 with such Fc mutations was measured in cynomolgus monkeys to the marketed IGF-1R antibody, teprotumumab, and a PK model was constructed to project potential human dosing regimens.</p>TED is an autoimmune condition most commonly associated with Graves' disease and hyperthyroidism but can also be found in patients who are euthyroid or hypothyroid. Orbitopathy in TED is driven by Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Receptor (TSHR) agonistic autoantibodies and crosstalk between TSHR and IGF-1R. Pathological remodeling of the orbit and periorbital tissues results in varied presentations which may include dry eyes, increased lacrimation, local irritation, eyelid retraction and eventually proptosis, diplopia, and optic nerve compression, with ensuing vision loss.</p>The underlying pathology of TED is the activation of an inflammatory cascade within the orbit, primarily due to recruitment of fibrocytes and immune cells. Over-expression of IGF-1R has be",
    "e YTE version had fewer lower molecular weight species as compared to the LS version. Thus, indicating that the YTE antibody has fewer impurities and is a more homogenous composition, which provides advantages over the antibody with the LS mutation. This was also not predictable as another antibody that was evaluated showed the opposite effect on such species. Furthermore, during purification, it was found that the LS mutant formed more aggregates when being purified on a cation exchange column as compared VRDN-2700. The aggregation of the LS mutant would cause significant manufacturing issues, which were not observed for VRDN-2700. Therefore, this difference in the Fc mutants for this antibody could not have been predicted or expected and leads to significant and unexpected advantages for the antibody that is referenced herein as VRDN-2700.</p>The prolonged half-life of VRDN-2700 (YTE) demonstrates that it can be used in a convenient SC injection, or as an IV infusion requiring fewer and/or less frequent treatments vs. conventional therapeutic IgG antibodies and has superior properties as compared to other Fc mutant versions of the same antibody (same variable regions).</p>Example 6: VRDN-1100 with YTE or YTE/C22S mutations bind to IGF-1R and inhibits IGF-1R autophosphorylation. The binding of VRDN-1100 with the Fc YTE mutations in the heavy chain (SEQ ID NO: 94) or C22S mutation and Fc YTE mutations in the heavy chain (SEQ ID NO: 95) to IGF-1R was evaluated in a cell based binding assay (A549 cells). The light chains have a sequence of SEQ ID NO: 93. The YTE Fc mutatant version of VRDN1100 was found to bind to A549 cells with an EC50 of 0.30 nm and the C22S and Fc YTE mutant had an EC50 of 0.36 nm. The antibodies were also evaluated for their ability to inhibit IGF-1R autophosphorylation. The YTE only mutant had an IC50 of 0.40 nm and the C22S plus YTE mutations had an IC50 of 0.37 nm. Thus, the antibodies were found to be able to both bind to IGF-1R and inhibit its autophosphorylation.</p>Example 7: VRDN-1100 with a C22S mutation binds to IGF-1R. A mutant of VRDN-1100 with a C22S mutation in the heavy chain (SEQ ID NO: 96) and a VL comprising a sequence of SEQ ID NO: 97 was evaluated for its binding to IGF-1R in a surface plasma resonance assay. Using this assay, the antibody was found to bind to IGF-1R with a k<sub>a </sub>(1/Ms) of 1.04\u00d710<sup>5</sup>, a k<sub>d </sub>(1/s) of 2.18\u00d710<sup>\u22125</sup>, and a K<sub>D</sub>(M) of 2.10\u00d710<sup>\u221210 </sup>at a pH of 7.4.</p>Each of these examples and the embodiments provided herein demonstrate that the antibodies provided for herein can be used to treat TED and their associate symptoms.</p>All references cited herein are incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each individual publication, database entry (e.g. Genbank sequences or GeneID entries), patent application, or patent, was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.
