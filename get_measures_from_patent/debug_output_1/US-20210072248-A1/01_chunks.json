    "l recurrence, distant metastases, second primary malignant melanomas and second other primary cancers are ignored. Other surrogate endpoints for survival can be used, as described further herein, such as disease-free survival (DFS), which includes time to any event related to the same cancer, i.e. all cancer recurrences and deaths from the same cancer are events.</p>In addition to endpoints, certain diagnostic and prognostic markers can be analyzed in conjunction with the methods described herein. For example, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) can be measured as a marker for disease progression. Patients with distant metastases and elevated LDH levels belong to stage IV Mlc. Another serum biomarker of interest is S100B. High S100B levels are associated with disease progression, and a decrease in the S100B level is an indicator of treatment response. Melanoma-inhibiting activity (MIA) is yet another serum biomarker that has been evaluated regarding its prognostic value. Studies have shown that elevated MIA levels are rare in stage I and II disease, whereas in stage III or IV, elevation in MIA levels can be seen in 60-100% of cases. Additional useful biomarkers include RGS1 (associated with reduced relapse-free survival (RFS)), osteopontin (associated with both reduced RFS and disease-specific survival (DSS), and predictive of SLN metastases), HER3 (associated with reduced survival), and NCOA3 (associated with poor RFS and DSS, and predictive of SLN metastases). In addition, HMB-45, Ki-67 (MD31), MITF and MART-1/Melan-A or combinations of any described marker may be used for staining (Ivan &amp; Prieto, 2010, Future Oncol. 6(7), 1163-1175; Linos et al., 2011, Biomarkers Med. 5(3) 333-360). In a literature review Rothberg et al. report that melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM)/MUC18, matrix metalloproteinase-2, Ki-67, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and p16/INK4A are predictive of either all-cause mortality or melanoma specific mortality (Rothberg et al., 2009 J. Nat. Canc. Inst. 101(7) 452-474).</p>Currently, the typical primary treatment of malignant melanoma is radical surgery. Even though survival rates are high after excision of the primary tumour, melanomas tend to metastasize relatively early, and for patients with metastatic melanoma the prognosis is poor, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 10%. Radical removal of distant metastases with surgery can be an option and systemic chemotherapy can be applied, but response rates are normally low (in most cases less than 20%), and most treatment regiments fail to prolong overall survival. The first FDA-approved chemotherapeutic agent for treatment of metastatic melanoma was dacarbazine (DTIC), which can give response rates of approximately 20%, but where less than 5% may be complete responses. Temozolamid is an analog of DTIC that has the advantage of oral administration, and which have been shown to give a similar response as DTIC. Other chemotherapeutic agents, for example different nitrosureas, cisplatin, carboplatin, and vinca alkaloids, have been used, but without any increase in response rates. Since chemotherapy is an inefficient treatment method, immunotherapy agents have also been proposed. Most studied are interferon-alpha and interleukin-2. As single agents they have not been shown to give a better respons"
