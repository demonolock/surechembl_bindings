    "lls transfected with WT TRPC6. Each trace represents the mean value derived from 15-20 cells in a single experiment, each experiment was replicated three times, with similar results. The error bars represent standard deviation. (FIG. 3C) Whole cell current recordings of HEK 293 cells expressing either WT TRPC6 or TRPC6<sup>P112Q </sup>protein. Considerable inward currents in normal Na<sup>+ </sup>extracellular solution were observed in WT TRPC6 cells. However, inward currents were significantly larger in TRPC6<sup>P112Q </sup>cells. When cells were perfused with 100 \u03bcM UTP, even larger inward currents were obtained. Cells expressing TRPC6<sup>P112Q </sup>mutation conducted 2-3 times more current than the WT TRPC6 expressing cells as depicted in the bar graph next to the current recordings. (FIG. 3D) Surface expression experiments in HEK 293 cells transfected with TRPC6 protein. Biotinylation was used to quantitate cell surface expression of TRPC6 proteins. Cells expressing TRPC6-V5 or TRPC6<sup>P112Q</sup>-V5 were incubated with biotin-SS reagent followed by pull-down with streptaviden agarose beads. Immunoblotting with an anti-V5 antibody of surface and whole cell lysates demonstrate increased surface expression of the TRPC6<sup>P112Q </sup>compared to wild-type TRPC6 protein. Immunoblotting with an anti-transferrin receptor antibody (TfR) is located in the middle row and shows no difference in the surface expression of the constitutively active plasma membrane receptor (95 kD band). Each experiment was replicated four times, with similar results. Densitometry measurement in relative units are depicted in the bar graph next to the immunoblot (the results from all four replicants are quantitated). The error bars represent standard error.</p>FIG. 4. Simplified version of pedigree for family 6530. Apparent autosomal dominant inheritance. Family structures have been changed for anonymity (1).</p>Definition of Disease Status:Affected\u2014Family members who had a renal biopsy demonstrating FSGS without evidence of other systemic diseases that have been known to cause FSGS, were on dialysis or had undergone renal transplantation.\n\nProbably affected\u2014Greater than or equal to 3+-4+proteinuria by qualitative urinalysis, in the absence of other systemic diseases likely to lead to proteinuria.\n\nUnknown\u2014Less than 1-2+proteinuria or 500 mg of proteinuria on 24-hour urine collection.\n\nUnaffected\u2014If they had no detectable proteinuria on qualitative urinalysis or were unrelated married-in spouses.\n</p>FIG. 5. Proline 112 is highly conserved in evolution and is present in TRPC protein homologs from Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans and Cavia porcellus (SEQ ID NOS: 1-6). The arrow indicates the mutated proline. Comparative alignments with the mouse, human and rat sequences indicate that a homolog of the TRPC protein family is also present in zebrafish (Danio rerio) and pufferfish (Fugu rubripes) and that this proline is al"
