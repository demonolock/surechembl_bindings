    " were amplified and directly sequence from gel-purified PCR products, corresponding to an overall PCR efficiency of 89%. Sequence analysis revealed that TTCF tetramer<sup>+</sup> cells employed a variety of different V<sub>H</sub>D-J<sub>H </sub>gene segments, without dominance of one particular gene segment. Sequences observed supported that clones represented cells diversified by somatic hypermutation.</p>Antibody production and purification included cloning heavy and light variable domain DNA into separate pcDNA3.3 expression vectors containing the bovine prolactin signal peptide sequence as well as full length IgG1 heavy or kappa light chain constant domains. Antibodies were expressed in CHO-S media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 8 mM Glutamax (Gibco) in 100 ml sinner flasks at 37\u00b0 C. with 8% CO<sub>2</sub>. One day prior to transfection, cells were split to 6\u00d710<sup>5 </sup>cells/ml. On the day of transfection, cells were adjusted, were necessary, to 1\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml. 25 \u03bcg of heavy and light chain plasmid DNA were co-transfected using MAX transfection reagent (Invitrogen) and transfected cells were cultured for 6-8 days. Protein was obtained using Protein G sepharose beads and antibody was eluted using 100 mM glycine pH2.5 and separated from beads using Spin-X centrifuge tubes. Purified antibody was exchanged into phosphate buffered saline (PBS) using Micro Bio-Spin columns (BioRad). Protein concentration was assessed by absorbance at 280 nm.</p>For saturation binding assay, non-biotinylated, MonoQ purified TTCF was labeled with europium and free europium was removed. 96-well flat bottom plates were coated overnight with 20 ng of antibody per well in 100 mM NaHCO<sub>3 </sub>buffer at pH 9.6. Blocking was performed with assay buffer supplemented with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and bovine gamma globulins. TTCF-europium was diluted in assay buffer (100 nM to 4 pM) and 200 \u03bcl was added per well in triplicate. Plates were incubated for 2 hours at 37\u00b0 C. and washed three times with 200 \u03bcl wash buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 20 \u03bcM EDTA, 0.05% Tween). 100 \u03bcl enhancement solution was added to each well and fluorescence counts measured using a Victor<sup>3 </sup>plate reader at 615 nm.</p>Heavy and light chain variable domain sequences were analyzed using IMGT/V-Quest and JIONSOLVER software. Flow cytometry data were evaluated using FlowJo analysis software. Statistical analyses were carried out using GraphPad Prism 5 software using unpaired t-test. To determine antibody K<sub>D </sub>values, saturation binding data were fitted using GraphPad Prism 5 software using non-linear regression analysis.</p>Example 3Multimerization Enhances Identification of Memory B CellsTetrameric and monomeric TTCF were compared. TTCF was fluorescently labeled with Alexa-488 and then used in monomeric form or was converted to a tetramer using unlabeled streptavidin (see above). Enriched B cells were then incubated with tetrameric or monomeric TTCF-Alexa-4"
