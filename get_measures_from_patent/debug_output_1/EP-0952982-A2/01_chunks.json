    "ially free of \n\nchemical precursors or other chemicals when synthesized chemically, or obtained by chemical</p>\n  cleavage of a protein.</p>\n  Preparation of vaccines which contain peptide sequences as active ingredients is well</p>\n  understood in the art. Typically, such vaccines are prepared as injectable vaccines, either as</p>\n  liquid solutions or suspension. Solid forms suitable for solution or suspension in liquid prior to</p>\n  injection may also be prepared. The preparation may in certain embodiments be emulsified or</p>\n  encapsulated in liposomes. The active ingredient can be mixed with any number of excipients</p>\n  which are pharmaceutically acceptable and compatible with the active ingredient or ingredients.</p>\n  EXAMPLES</p>\n  Example 1</p>\n  A selected peptide LLGRMK, in the phage associate form, was fused at the N termini of</p>\n  gpIII so that the sequence of the fusion protein would start:</p>\n  ADGALLGRMKGA...gpIII sequence</p>\n  Random mutagenesis was performed on DNA encoding the peptide LLGRMKG fused within the gpIII coat protein of fd phage. Initially this was performed using the Kunkel method of mutagenesis (4) with a primer designed to randomize the flanking amino acids A and G. A phage library was prepared by propagating the initial phage mutants and panning this against HBcAg on nitrocellulose discs, as described. Dyson &amp; Murray, PNAS 92: 2194-2198 (1995). After three rounds of panning, binding phage were isolated, sequenced and purified for dissociation constant measurements. Dyson et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 23: 1531-1535 (1995). The most effective binder to HBcAg was one in which the N-terminal flanking alanine had been mutated to serine (phage 3). This exhibited a relative dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub><sup>Rel</sup>) of 1.7 nM and was a considerable improvement in binding affinity over the original \"wild-type\" sequence \n\n(phage Bl), with a K<sub>D</sub><sup>Rel</sup> of 152 nM (Table II). This improvement is caused by the addition of a hydroxyl group and one can postulate that this may be involved in hydrogen bonding with HBcAg.</p>\n  A second generation of random mutation was performed by Kunkel mutagenesis on DNA encoding the peptide ADGSLLGRMKGA fused to gpIII. A primer designed to randomize the G located adjacent the N-terminus and the C-terminal A was employed to construct a second phage display library which was panned against HBcAg. This was performed as described previously except that the panning took place at room temperature in polystyrene wells. The phage with the highest affinity in this case was phage 2A-8 where the glycine adjacent the N-terminus had been mutated to arginine. This displayed a K<sub>D</sub><sup>Rel</sup> of 1.1 nM (Table II). Primers were also employed to insert random 9-mer nucleotides between the codons for the G and S residues adjacent to the N terminus and the codons for G and A at the C terminus. Panning experiments using phage libraries derived from these primers resulted in a phage with enhanced affinity which had the tripeptide MHR inserted adjacent to the N terminus (phage 4A-15), with a K<sub>D</sub><sup>Rel</sup> of 0.55 nM (Table II).</p>\n  Free peptides have been synthesized based on these phag",
    "ostar) was soaked in 15% (v l/vol) methanol/25mM Tris base/250 mM glycine for 15 min and placed on a dot-blot apparatus; HBcAg [20 \u03bcl; 0.25 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)] was then washed through the membrane. The excised circles were placed in siliconized microcentrifuge tubes containing blocking buffer [400 \u03bcl; bovine serum albumin (BSA) at 10 mg/ml/0.5% Tween/0.02% NaN<sub>3</sub>/TBS] and left at 6\u00b0C overnight. An aliquot of the phage library [5 XI 0<sup>10</sup> plaque-forming units (pfu)] was incubated with TBS (400 \u03bclVBSA (0.1 mg/ml)/Tween (0.5%) for 1 hr at 6\u00b0C, to absorb those phage that bind BSA. The discs were then placed in the same buffer containing the phage library and rotated at 6\u00b0C for 4 hr and washed six times with wash buffer A (0.5% Tween/TBS) or wash buffer B (0.5% Tween/50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5/0.5 M NaCl), with a 10-min interval between each wash. Finally, elution buffer (400 \u03bcl; 0.1 M HC1, titrated to pH 2.2 by the addition of solid glycine/BSA at 1 mg/ml) was added, and after 10 min eluates were neutralized by addition of Tris-HCl (38 \u03bcl, 1 M, pH 9), titered, and amplified. Amplified eluates were subjected to two further rounds of affinity enrichment. DNA was isolated from individual phage clones, and the nucleotide sequence was determined (22) by using primer 5' -AGTTTTGTCGTCTTTCC-3'. Selected phage plaques were amplified in 500- ml cultures and purified by PEG precipitation and equilibrium centrifugation in 31% (wt/wt) CsCl/TBS.</p>\n  Phage-Binding Assay in Solution. HBcAg at various concentrations (0.3-10 \u03bcM) was incubated at 6\u00b0 for 18 hr with fusion phage Bl (10<sup>9</sup> pfu/ml) in TBS/BSA (0.2 mg/ml)/NaN<sub>3</sub> (0.02%). Aliquots (100 \u03bcl) of each mixture were transferred to polystyrene wells (no. 2585, Costar) that had been coated with HBcAg (20 \u03bcg/ml in PBS; 125 \u03bcl per well). After 1 hr at 6\u00b0C the wells were washed 10 times with TBS/BSA at 0.2 mg/ml. Bound phage were recovered and titered as described in the previous section. All assays were done in triplicate. The HBcAg concentration range was 1.58-50 \u03bcM for experiments with phage B2 and B3 and was 0.63-20 \u03bcM for experiments with phage B4. For peptide inhibition experiments, fusion phage (10<sup>9</sup> pfu/ml; 200 \u03bcl) were incubated with various concentrations of peptide (lmM-10 nM) in HBcAg- coated wells for 90 min at 6\u00b0C. \n\n In Vitro Transcription, Translation, and Translocation. Templates for transcription were linearized by digestion with Sal I. Transcription reactions were done as described (23) by using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega). Synthetic RNAs were stored at -70 \u00b0C in 4-\u03bcl aliquots. Translations were done at 30 \u00b0C for 2 hr by using micrococcal nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Flexi rabbit reticulocyte lysate system, Promega). Reactions (18 \u03bcl) contained 2 \u03bcl of a 1:10 dilution of the transcription reaction, 10 \u03bcl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate, 20 \u03bcM of amino acid mixture minus methionine, 0.7 \u03bcl of [<sup>35</sup>S] methionine ("
