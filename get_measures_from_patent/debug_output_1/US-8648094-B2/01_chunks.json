    "h thaw. The cells were disrupted further by passing the extract four times through a Bio-Neb Cell disruptor device (Glas-col) set at 100 psi with Nitrogen gas. The extract was clarified by centrifugation at 4 C at 15000 RPM in a SS-34 Beckman rotor for 30 minutes. The resulting supernatant was then mixed with 2 ml of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) per 500 ml cell culture (per 1000 ml culture for full length XIAP) for 1 hour at 4 C. Afterwards, the beads were washed 3 times with 1\u00d7 Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS) to remove unbound proteins. The retained proteins were eluted with 2 washes of 2 ml of 50 mM TRIS pH 8.0 containing 10 mM reduced glutathione. The eluted proteins were pooled and precipitated with 604 g/liter of ammonium sulfate and the resulting pellet re-suspended into an appropriate buffer. As judged by SDS-PAGE the purified proteins were &gt;90% pure. The protein concentration of purified proteins was determined from the Bradford method.</p>His-tag proteins were expressed in the E. Coli strain in E. coli AD494 cells using a pet28ACPP32 construct. The soluble protein fraction was prepared as described above. For protein purification, the supernatant was purified by affinity chromatography using chelating-Sepharose (Pharmacia) charged with NiSO<sub>4 </sub>according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purity of the eluted protein was &gt;90% pure as determined by SDS-PAGE. The protein concentration of purified proteins was determined from the Bradford assay.</p>Binding Assay</p>Fluorescence Polarization-Based Competition Assay</p>For all assays, the fluorescence and fluorescence-polarization was evaluated using a Tecan Polarion instrument with the excitation filter set at 485 nm and the emission filter set at 535 nm. For each assay, the concentration of the target protein was first established by titration of the selected protein in order to produce a linear dose-response signal when incubated alone in the presence of the fluorescent probe. Upon establishing these conditions, the compounds potency (IC<sub>50</sub>) and selectivity, was assessed in the presence of a fix defined-amount of target protein and fluorescent probe and a 10 point serial dilution of the selected compounds. For each IC<sub>50 </sub>curve, the assays were run as followed: 25 uL/well of diluted compound in 50 mM MES buffer pH 6.5 were added into a black 96 well plate then 25 uL/well of bovine serum albumin (BSA) at 0.5 mg/ml in 50 mM MES pH 6.5. Auto-fluorescence for each compound was first assessed by performing a reading of the compound/BSA solution alone. Then 25 uL of the fluorescein probe diluted into 50 mM MES containing 0.05 mg/ml BSA were added and a reading to detect quenching of fluorescein signal done. Finally 25 uL/well of the target or control protein (GST-BIRs) diluted at the appropriate concentration in 50 mM MES containing 0.05 mg/ml BSA were added and the fluorescence polarization evaluated.</p>Determination of IC<sub>50 </sub>and Inhibitory Con"
