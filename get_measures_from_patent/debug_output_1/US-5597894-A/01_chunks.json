    "ing concentrations of unlabeled ligand in a shaking, temperature controlled water-bath (17\u00b0 C.) for 30 minutes. The reaction was terminated by centrifugation at 11,000\u00d7G for 3 minutes. Supernatant fluid was aspirated and the radioactivity of bound ligand in the pellet quantified in a gamma counter.</p>Specific binding was calculated using the difference between total and non-specific (in the presence of 1 \u03bcM unlabeled ligand) binding. Equilibrium dissociation constants (K<sub>D</sub>) and the maximal number of binding sites (B<sub>max</sub>) were determined using seven concentrations of unlabeled peptide in a competitive binding curve and calculated using a computerized nonlinear least squares fit to the mass-law equation of Munson and Rodbard, Munson, P. J. et al., Anal. Biochem., 107:220-239, 1980, as modified by McPhearson, G. A., J. of Pharm. Meth., 14:213-228, 1985. The results of these assays with WOC-2A, WOC-2B, WOC-3A, WOC-3B, WOC-4, and WOC-8 are shown in Table 3. Binding curves for native somatostatin, WOC-2A, and WOC-3B are shown in FIGS. 2A, 2B, and 2C, respectively. FIG. 2D is a graph of a composite curve showing relative affinities of native somatostatin, WOC-2A, and WOC-3B, and the commercially available somatostatin analog LANREOTIDE\u00ae.</p>              TABLE 3\n______________________________________\n                      Somatostatin\n                      Receptor Binding\n           GH release (IMR32 membranes)\n           (IC.sub.50, nM)\n                      (Kd, nM)\n______________________________________\nSomatostatin 0.46 \u00b1 0.04 (18)*\n                          0.23 \u00b1 0.15\nLANREOTIDE \u00ae\n             0.40 \u00b1 0.10 (3)\n                          1.05 \u00b1 0.51\nWOC-2A       4.84 \u00b1 0.58 (7)\n                          5.73 \u00b1 0.22\nWOC-2B        --          1.2\nWOC-3A       0.96 \u00b1 0.01 (2)\n                          1.93 \u00b1 0.35\nWOC-3B       0.66 \u00b1 0.06 (8)\n                          1.14 \u00b1 0.28\nWOC-4         --          1.0\nWOC-8        2.46 \u00b1 0.69 (6)\n                          0.69 \u00b1 0.42\n______________________________________\n *Number of samples tested for GH release.\n</pre></p>Exposure of IMR-32 membranes to radiolabeled somatostatin analog WOC-3A resulted in high levels of total binding. When membranes having bound radiolabeled WOC-3A were incubated in the presence of a 10,000-fold excess of unlabeled WOC-3A or native somatostatin, no radioactivity was displaced. These results indicate that halogenated, multi-tyrosinated analogs bind somatostatin receptors in an irreversible (or nearly irreversible) manner, and imply that these somatostatin analogs can be internalized into the cell.</p>The multi-tyrosinated somatostatin analogs were also tested for their ability to inhibit release of growth hormone (GH) from acutely dispersed rat pituitary cells, which express SSTR2. Pituitaries from adult Charles River CD male rats (Wilmington, Mass.) housed under controlled conditions (lights on from 0500-1900 hrs), were dispersed and cultured using aseptic "
