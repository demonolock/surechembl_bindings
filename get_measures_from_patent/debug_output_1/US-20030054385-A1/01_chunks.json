    "degradation signal. E2 links the Ub molecule through its C-terminal glycine to an internal lysine of the target protein. It must be noted that different ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathways employ structurally similar, but distinct, E2s, and in some instances, accessory factors known as ubiquitin-ligases or E3s, are required to work in conjunction with E2s for recognition of certain substrates. More than one Ub molecule may be needed to ubiquinate a target protein which subsequently is recognized and degraded by a proteasome. After degradation, Ub is released and reutilized. </p>[0005] Prior to activation, Ub is usually expressed as a fusion protein composed of an N-terminal ubiquitin and a C-terminal extension protein (CEP) or as a polyubiquitin protein with Ub monomers attached head to tail. CEPs bear similarities to a variety of regulatory proteins in that most are highly basic, contain up to 30% lysine and arginine residues, and have nucleic acid-binding domains (Monia et al. (1989) J Biol Chem 264:4093-4103). The fusion protein is an important intermediate form which appears to allow co-regulation of the cell's translational and protein degradation activities and to localize inactive enzyme to specific cellular sites. Once delivered, C-terminal hydrolases cleave the fusion protein releasing Ub to carry out its work (Monia, supra). </p>[0006] E2s are important for substrate specificity in different UCS pathways. All E2s have a conserved UBC domain of approximately 16 kD and at least 35% identity and contain a centrally located cysteine residue which is required for ubiquitin-enzyme thiolester formation (Jentsch, supra). A highly conserved proline-rich element is located N-terminal to the active cysteine residue. Structural variations beyond the conserved domain are used to classify the E2 enzymes. The E2s of class 1 (E2-1) consist almost exclusively of the conserved UBC domain and include yeast E2-1 and UBCs 4, 5, and 7. These E2s a thought to require E3 to carry out their activities (Jentsch, supra). UBC7 has been shown to recognize ubiquitin as a substrate and to form polyubiquitin chains in vitro (van Nocker et al. (1996) J Biol Chem 271:12150-58). E2s of class II (E2-2) have various unrelated C-terminal extensions that contribute to substrate specificity and cellular localization. The yeast E2-2 enzymes, UBC2 and UBC3, have highly acidic C-terminal extensions that promote interactions with basic substrates such as histones. Yeast UBC6 has a hydrophobic signal-anchor sequence that localizes the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum. </p>[0007] Defects or alterations in the normal activity of the UCS are associated with a number of diseases and disorders. These include increased ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis as associated with cachexia (Llovera et al. (1995) Int J Cancer 61:138-141), degradation of the tumor-suppressor protein, p53 (Ciechanover, supra), and neurodegeneration such as observed in Alzheimer's disease (Gregori et al. (1994",
    "cts. Thus, the invention provides the means to rapidly determine the molecular mode of action of a drug. </p>[0116] Such assays may also be used to evaluate the efficacy of a particular therapeutic treatment regimen in animal studies or in clinical trials or to monitor the treatment of an individual patient. Once the presence of a condition is established and a treatment protocol is initiated, diagnostic assays may be repeated on a regular basis to determine if the level of expression in the patient begins to approximate that which is observed in a normal subject. The results obtained from successive assays may be used to show the efficacy of treatment over a period ranging from several days to years. </p>[0117] Protein Assays </p>[0118] Immunological methods for detecting and measuring complex formation as a measure of protein expression using either specific polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies are known in the art. Examples of such techniques include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), radioimmunoassays (RIAs), fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and protein and antibody arrays. Such immunoassays typically involve the measurement of complex formation between the protein and its specific antibody. These assays and their quantitation against purifed, labeled standards are well known in the art (Ausubel, supra, unit 10.1-10.6). A two-site, monoclonal-based immunoassay utilizing antibodies reactive to two non-interfering epitopes is preferred, but a competitive binding assay may be employed (Pound (1998) Immunochemical Protocols, Humana Press, Totowa N.J.). </p>[0119] These methods are also useful for diagnosing diseases that show differential protein expression. Normal or standard values for protein expression are established by combining body fluids or cell extracts taken from a normal mammalian or human subject with specific antibodies to a protein under conditions for complex formation. Standard values for complex formation in normal and diseased tissues are established by various methods, often photometric means. Then complex formation as it is expressed in a subject sample is compared with the standard values. Deviation from the normal standard and toward the diseased standard provides parameters for disease diagnosis or prognosis while deviation away from the diseased and toward the normal standard may be used to evaluate treatment efficacy. </p>[0120] Recently, antibody arrays have allowed the development of techniques for high-throughput screening of recombinant antibodies. Such methods use robots to pick and grid bacteria containing antibody genes, and a filter-based ELISA to screen and identify clones that express antibody fragments. Because liquid handling is eliminated and the clones are arrayed from master stocks, the same antibodies can be spotted multiple times and screened against multiple antigens simultaneously. Antibody arrays are highly useful in the identification of differentially expressed proteins. (See de W"
