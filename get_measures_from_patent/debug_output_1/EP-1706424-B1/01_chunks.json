In further embodiments, the present invention comprises a variant of a parent polypeptide having an Fc region, wherein the variant comprises at least one surface amino acid modification and at least one non-surface amino acid modification.</p>III. Combination VariantsIn some embodiments, the variants of the present comprise two or more amino acid modifications (e.g. substitutions). Such combination variants may be produced, for example, by selecting two or more of the amino acid modifications detailed above. Table 1 below provides exemplary combinations of two or more amino acid substitutions. For example, the first row of Table 1 shows possible combinations of P247H with other amino acid substitutions at postions 251, 256, 268, 280, 330, 332, 339, 378 and 440 (e.g. this row shows combinations of two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and ten amino acid modifications).\nTable 1.Exemplary Combination VariantsMutationPosition247251256268280330332339378440P247HFM, PD, EA, KK, RD, ETDYP247IFM, PD, EA, KK, RD, ETDYP247LFM, PD, EA, KK, RD, ETDYL251FH, I, LM, PD, EA, KK, RD, ETDYT256MH, I, LFD, EA, KK, RD, ETDYT256PH, I, LFD, EA, KK, RD, ETDYH268DH, I, LFM, PA, KK, RD, ETDYH268EH, I, LFM, PA, KK, RD, ETDYD280AH, I, LFM, PD, EK, RD, ETDYD280KH, I, LFM, PD, EK, RD, ETDYA330KH, I, LFM, PD, EA, KD, ETDYA330RH, I, LFM, PD, EA, KD, ETDYI332EH, I, LFM, PD, EA, KK, RTDYI332DH, I, LFM, PD, EA, KK, RTDYA339TH, I, LFM, PD, EA, KK, RD, EDYA378DH, I, LFM, PD, EA, KK, RD, ETYS440YH, I, LFM, PD, EA, KK, RD, ETD** Note that table uses EU numbering as in Kabat.</p>The combination variants shown in Table 1 and other combination variants (such as those disclosed in WO0042072</patcit>) may be tested for a given activity (e.g. FcR binding activity, ADCC activity, and CDC activity) in a variety of assays (See, Section IV. below). In this regard, useful combination variants may be identified.</p>In certain preferred embodiments, the combination variants of the present invention have one amino acid modification that increases ADCC activity, and one amino acid modification that increases neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) binding affinity (e.g., at pH 6.0, but not at pH 7.0 or 7.4). In other embodiments, the combination variants of the present invention have one surface amino acid modification, and one non-surface amino acid modification. Additional combination variants may be generated by combining two or more of the amino acid modifications described herein, or at least one of the amino acid modifications described herein with those described in WO0042072</patcit>.</p>IV. Variant Polypeptide AssaysThe present invention provides various assays for screening Fc region variants. Screening assays may be used to find or confirm useful variants. For example, combination variants (See Table 1) may be screened to find variants wit",
    "mplement may be diluted with buffer. Cells which express the antigen to which the polypeptide variant binds may be diluted to a density of \u223c1 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml. Mixtures of polypeptide variant, diluted human complement and cells expressing the antigen may be added to a flat bottom tissue culture 96 well plate and allowed to incubate for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> to facilitate complement mediated cell lysis. 50 ul of alamar blue (Accumed International) may then be added to each well and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. The absorbance may be measured using a 96-well fluorimeter with excitation at 530 nm and emission at 590 nm. The results may be expressed in relative fluorescence units (RFU). The sample concentrations may be computed from a standard curve and the percent activity as compared to nonvariant polypeptide may be reported for the polypeptide variant of interest.</p>In certain embodiments, the variants of the present invention do not activate complement. For example, a polypeptide variant displays about 0-10% CDC activity in this assay compared to a control antibody having a nonmutated IgGl Fc region. Preferably the variant does not appear to have any CDC activity (e.g. above background) in the above CDC assay. In other embodiments, the variants of the present invention are found to have enhanced CDC compared to a parent polypeptide (e.g., displaying about two-fold to about 100-fold (or greater) improvement in CDC activity in vitro or in vivo when the IC50 values are compared).</p>The variants of the present invention may also be screened for depletion of target cells in a whole blood assay. For example, various concentrations of the polypeptide variant with CD20 target specificity can be screened for the depletion of B cells in a whole blood assay using facs (Vugmeyster et al., 2003 Cytometry 52A, 101-109). Freshly drawn blood is incubated with varying concentrations of polypeptide variant at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 4 hours (time can be varied). Following the incubation red blood cells are lysed per manufacturer's directions with an ammonium chloride reagent (Beckton-Dickinson cat. #555899) and B cells are detected by facs using a fluorescent-labeled antibody specific for B cells (anti-CD19, for example). The results may be expressed as % depletion of B cells relative to either an untreated sample or a sample incubated with an irrelevant (non-depleting) antibody.</p>In preferred embodiments, the variant depletes B cells more effectively than the parental polypeptide. A variant may deplete B cells, for example, to about two-fold or greater extent, and preferably about five-fold or more. Also, a variant may display greater potency in depleting B cells. For example, a variant may deplete the same percentage of B cells relative to parental polypeptide, but utilize about five-fold less, and preferably about 10-fold less antibody. Target cell depletion mediated by variants may be about 5-fold to about 100-fold, and prefe",
    "doma cell. The hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, parental myeloma cells. For example, if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT medium), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.</p>Preferred myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level production of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. Among these, preferred myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines, such as those derived from MOPC-21 and MPC-11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, California USA, and SP-2 or X63-Ag8-653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Maryland USA. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (e.g., Kozbor, J. Immunol., 133: 3001 (1984).</p>Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). After hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity, affinity, and/or activity, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods. Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, D-MEM or RPMI-1640 medium. In addition, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal. The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium, ascites fluid, or serum by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography.</p>DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the monoclonal antibodies). The hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as E. coli cells, simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. Recombinant production of antibodies is described in mor",
    "ays are performed in duplicate. Each assay plate contains controls for spontaneous target lysis, spontaneous effector plus target lysis in the absence of IgG and target cell total lysis. Target cell total lysis is achieved by addition of 1% Triton X-100 to the target cells. Three wild type controls are included on each assay plate and the ADCC assay signal averaged. The background value, obtained from the spontaneous lysis controls, is subtracted from each sample. The background value, obtained from the diluted IgG, is subtracted from each sample. The data are converted from absorbance values to percentage of specific-lysis based upon the spontaneous and total lysis controls. The percentage of specific-lysis is calculated from the following equation: percentage specific lysis = (experimental A490 - background A490)/(maximal A490 - background A490) X 100, where background A490 is the sum of the A490 obtained from the effector and target cells in the absence of IgG and the IgG background due to contaminating LDH present in the crude IgG supernatants. The percentage of the Fc variant activity is normalized relative to the averaged wild type controls. The percentage of the normalized activity for duplicate assay plates are averaged and the standard deviation between individual assay plates calculated for each sample.</p>vii. ResultsThe relative ADCC specific activity are shown in Table 2. The CDC values reported in this table were generated as described in Example 4 and the FcRn binding assay value reported in this table were generated as described in Example 5.\nTABLE 2VariantADCCFcRn 6.0FcRn 7.0CDCParental100100100100P247H161797381P2471163897442P247L166927849L251F123102100138T256M1267282167T256P115132121315H268D1278784137H268E1299081108D280A1449184141D280K14010393144A330K1291049943A330R1237710131I332D145911021461332E1619997150I332K121099767I332R12979288A339T130115109189A378D1011229328S440Y116106102199</p>In this experiment, SKW6.4 cells were opsonized using both single and double amino acid Fc-region IgG variants followed by addition of PBMCs at a ratio of 15:1. The assay plate was incubated at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 3 hours, followed by centrifugation. A portion of the supernatant was collected and transferred to a microtiter plate and the LDH activity in the supernatant detected by addition of an equal volume of LDH substrate. Following color development the absorbance was read at 490 nm. The background due to contaminating LDH in the crude IgG supernatants was measured and these background values were subtracted from the raw A490. These data reveal that compared to the wild-type anti-CD20 antibody the ADCC activity of the A330K, A330R and I332E single amino acid variants are enhanced. The combination of either A330K or A330R with the I332E variant further improves the ADCC activity. A non-specific IgG shows no activity under these assay conditions. The activity of the I332 variant can be further enhanced with altered glycos",

Alternatively, to facilitate comparison between donors, data was expressed as % of initial CD19+ cells remaining i.e. (%CD19+ lymphocytes remaining after treatment)/(%CD19+ lymphocytes in FACS buffer treated sample) x 100%.</p>Representative B-cell depletion data demonstrates that the I332E variant depeletes B cells more potently and to a greater extent than Rituxan in a whole blood sample containing the W (high affinity) genotype of the Fc\u03b3RIIIa receptor.</p>Representative B-cell depletion data demonstrates that the I332E variant depeletes B cells more potently and to a greater extent than Rituxan in a whole blood sample containing the FF (low affinity) genotype of the Fc\u03b3RIIIa receptor. Similar results are obtained when the assay is performed with whole blood displaying the VF (heterozygous) genotype for the Fc\u03b3RIIIa receptor or with HH, HR, or RR genotypes of the Fc\u03b3RIIa receptor (Table 3).\nTable 3.

Fc\u03b3RIIIa/IgG Kd analysisHuman Fc\u03b3RIIIa(158F) soluble extracellular domain was expressed in 293 cells and purified by Ni-NTA resin binding to its engineered 6-histidine tag.</p>One tube of Azlactone beads (Sapidyne) was coupled with 1mg of Fc\u03b3RIII(158F) in sodium bicarbonate buffer pH 9.3. The slurry was tumbled overnight at 4\u00b0C, washed twice with PBS and blocked with blocking buffer (1M Tris pH 7.4 + 1% BSA) for 1 hour at room temperature. The beads were then washed three times with PBS and re-suspended in 50 mL of PBS with 0.01% azide. Twelve equilibrations all containing 7.5 nM IgG and Fc\u03b3RIII titrated from 4 \u00b5M to 1.95 nM were prepared in running buffer (PBS pH 7.4, 0.1% BSA 0.01% azide) and allowed to equilibrate for 16 hours at room temperature. All experiments were run in running buffer at room temperature with flow rates at 0.5 ml/min. Following packing of the Fc\u03b3RIII beads in the flow cell of the instrument, free IgG was captured from the first equilibration. The beads were then washed and bound. IgG detected using a goat anti-human Fc (Fab')2-FITC conjugate (Jackson Immunochemicals). The process was then repeated for the remaining 11 equilibrations and the Kd determined following analysis with the Kinexa Pro software. Using this approach, the affinity (Kd) of the interaction between Fc\u03b3RIIIa (FF genotype) and wild type, or parental, Fc was determined to be 387 nM while the affinity of variant I332E was 52 nM. Glycoengineered antibody (GnTIII) displayed a Kd of 83 nM while a combinatorial variant (L256P, I332E) displayed a Kd of 21 nM.</p>Example 4Characterization of CDC Activity of VariantsThis example descibes how the CDC activity of various Fc region variants was determined.</p>i. AssayThis assay was carried out using human complement (Quidel Corp., cat#A113) on Ramos (RA #1) cell (ATCC Catalog No. CRL-1596). Ramos cells were cultured in Gibco RPMI1640 media containing10% FBS at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. The day before the assay, cells were seeded at 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells in a T175 flask. The following day, the cells were resuspended to 3.57 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml in RPMI1640 without phenol red containing 1% FBS. Distribute 70 \u00b5l cells per well to a Costar 3917 flat bottom plate. For titration curve, variant IgG was prepared in a 3-fold serial dilution in RPMI1640 media. For single-point library screening assay, transiently expressed IgG variant in culture supernatant was normalized to 1 \u00b5g/ml in mock media. Thirty microliter of variant IgG (i.e. 200 ng/ml final concentration) and 50 \u00b5l of human complement (Quidel Corp., cat#AI13) 1:5 diluted in RPMI1640 + 1% FBS was added to the target cell and mixed well by gentle pipetting. The plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 1.5 hours. After addition of 15 \u00b5l/well of Alamar Blue (Serotec, cat#BUF012B) the incubation continued overnight. The following morning, the fluorescence signal was measured by PerkinElmer's EnVision 2100 multilabel reader with excitation at 560 nm and emission at 590 nm.</p>ii. Data AnalysisAll si"
