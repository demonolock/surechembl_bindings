    "lification reaction using HLA-F\n\u03b1-chain specific primers (5'-ACATCGCCGTGGAGTACGTAGACG-3'\nand 3'-GAACACCTCTGGTCCGGACGTCCC-5'). The nucleotide\nsequence of the cDNA thus obtained was determined and then\ncompared with the nucleotide sequence of the HLA-F gene, \nthereby identifying as a HLA-F cDNA fragment of 647 bp-long\nextending from exon 2 over exon 4. Said sequence comprises\nof the DNA sequence of the 5' end of SEQ ID. 3, to which ac\nis appended.</p>\n  (2) Preparation of cancer cell-specific HLA-F antigen\n  The HLA-F cDNA fragment obtained in (1) was ligated\nin the downstream region of the histidine tag DNA (His x6)\nin the expression vector pQE31. The base sequence 5'-GACGACGACGACAAA\n-3' coding for the Enterokinase recognition\nsequence (Ek) Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys was inserted between said\nhistidine tag DNA and the HLA-F cDNA fragment. A\nrecombinant plasmid was obtained by cloning. The E. coli\nJM109 line was transformed by said recombinant plasmid.\nExpression of the fusion protein of His x6 and the HLA-F\nfragment was induced in the resulting transformant by\naddition of isopropyl thiogalactopyranoside(IPTG) to the\nmedium.</p>\n  Said E. coli producing the fusion protein was\ndisrupted by ultrasonication and insoluble material was\nseparated. Said insoluble material was then made soluble\nby treating with urea and the fusion protein was purified\nfrom the lysate by Ni-chelate affinity chromatography.\nAnalysis of the purified material on SDS-PAGE revealed that \nits molecular weight is 31 KD and the purity 95 %.\nDetermination of N-terminal amino acid sequence proved that\ntranslation of the fusion protein takes place as expected.</p>\n  Said purified fusion protein was treated with\nEnterokinase to obtain cancer cell-specific HLA-F antigen.\nSDS-PAGE analysis revealed, aside from the 31 KD molecular\nweight band not cleaved by the Enterokinase, the presence\nof 29 KD, 18 KD, and 13 KD bands. The amino acid sequences\nof the materials in these bands were determined. The\nresults revealed that they were fragments of HLA-F gene\nproducts.</p>\n  (3) Detection of Anti HLA-F Antibody by Way of Western\nBlotting\n  The cancer cell-specific HLA-F antigen separated by\nSDS-PAGE was blotted on a Clearblot P membrane\n(manufactured by ATTO Corp., Tokyo, Japan), followed by\nblocking by applying the PBS containing 1 % bovine serum\nalbumin (BSA) and 5 % skim milk to obtain a filter for\ndetection of anti HLA-F antibody. This filter was used for\ndetection of anti-HLA-F antibody.</p>\n  Said filter for detection of anti-HLA-F antibody was\nsubmerged in 100 \u00b5l sera which are diluted 10 fold with T-PBS\nand kept for 90 minutes at 37\u00b0C for reaction. The sera \nwere obtained from 52 subjects (32 cancer patients and 20\nhealthy subjects), and were used as the source of the\nprimary antibody. After being washed carefully with T-PBS,\nit was further submerged in 1 ml of T-PBS containing 0.2 \u00b5l\nof the alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-human IgG rabbit\nantibody (manufactured by Promega Corp., Madison, WI) used\nas the secondary antibody, and keep for 90 minutes at 37 \u00b0C\nor 8 to 48 hours at 4 \u00b0C. The resultant specimen is\nfurther washed by using T-PBS and brought into reaction\nwith the alkaline phosphotase color development chemical\nProtoBlot Western Blot AP System (manufactured by Promega\nCorp., Madison, WI).</p>\n  (4) Diagnosis of Cancer\n  When one of the 31KD, 29KD, 18KD or 13KD bands on the\nfilter for detection of anti-HLA-F antibody showed positive\ncolor development, it was postulated that the result\nindicated the presence of anti-HLA-F antibody in the serum\nof the subject. This result, in turn, revealed the\npresence of cancer and was used as a basic for diagnosis of\ncancer.</p>\n  Table 1 represents the results of color development\non the anti-HLA-F antibody detection filter prepared\naccording to the method described in (3). O shows positive \ncolor development in one of the 31 KD, 29 KD, 18 KD, or 13\nKD molecular weight bands. When color development was\nobserved in two or more bands, it was marked \u2295. If no\ncolor appears in any of the bands, it was marked \u00d7.</p>\n  EXAMPLE 2\n  Instead of inserting the nucleotide sequence coding\nfor the Enterokinase recognition sequence between the\nhistidine tag DNA and the HLA-F cDNA fragment as in EXAMPLE\n1 (2), the nucleotide sequence 5'-ATCGAGGGCAGA-3' coding\nfor the Factor Xa recognition sequence Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg was\ninserted. The expressed fusion protein was processed for\npurification of the cancer cell-specific HLA-F antigen as\nin EXAMPLE 1, except it was treated with factor Xa (Protein\nEngineering Technology manufactured by Dynzyme ApS, Aarhus,\nDenmark). The cancer cell-specific HLA-F antigen thus\nobtained was analyzed with SDS-PAGE and molecular weight\nbands of 31 KD and 29 KD were distinctively observed.</p>\n  Similar to EXAMPLE 1 above, detection of an anti-HLA-F\nantibody and cancer diagnosis are conducted on the 52\nsubjects including 32 cancer patients and 20 healthy donors.\nTable 1 represents the results of the color development on\nthe anti-HLA-F antibody detection filter. When positive\ncolor development was observed in the 29 KD molecular \nweight band, it was marked O, while if no color appeared\nin the 29 KD band, it was marked \u00d7.</p>\n  EXAMPLE 3\n  HLA-F cDNA is prepared from cultured cancer cells as\nin EXAMPLE 1, The HLA-F cDNA thus obtained was inserted in\na fusion protein of glutathione-S-transferase (GST)\nexpression vector. E. coli JM109 was transformed with the\nresulting recombinant plasmid and the GST-HLA-F fusion\nprotein was obtained. The fusion protein thus obtained was\nsolubilized in the presence of SDS and cleaved with\nthrombin to obtain a cancer cell-specific HLA-F antigen.\nSDS-PAGE of the thrombin digest showed 27.5 KD band of the\nGST and 25 KD band of the HLA-F fragment.</p>\n  Similar to EXAMPLE 1, detection of anti-HLA-F\nantibody and cancer diagnosis were conducted on 20 subjects,\nincluding 13 cancer patients and 7 healthy subjects. It\nshould be noted that, owing to a large amount of antibodies\nreactive with E Coli components present in sera of the\nsubjects, color development somewhat lacks distinctiveness.\nTable 1 represents the results of the color development of\nthe anti-HLA-F antibody detection filter. When distinct\ncolor was observed in the 25 KD band, it was marked with O,\nwhile if no color appeared in the 25 KD band, it was marked \nwith \u00d7.\nDetection of Anti HLA-F AntibodySubjectCancerPrimaryGender AgeResultPatient No.Tumor siteEX.1EX.2EX.31liverM53OO2stomachM59OOO3liverF62OO\u00d74breastF65\u2295OO5lungM46\u00d7\u00d7\u00d76ovaryF63\u00d7\u00d7\u00d77uterusF44OOO8liverM64OOO9ovaryF52\u00d7\u00d7-10liver, stomachM70OO-11breastF61\u00d7\u00d7\u00d712liverM77\u00d7\u00d7-13pancreasF64\u2295O-14histiocytomaM58\u00d7\u00d7\u00d715S colonM56\u00d7\u00d7-16stomachM48OO- 17kidneyM63\u00d7\u00d7-18breastF36\u00d7\u00d7-19ovaryF61OO-20lungM62\u00d7\u00d7-21ovaryF52\u00d7\u00d7-22breastF57\u00d7\u00d7-23ovaryF38\u00d7\u00d7-24lungM58\u00d7\u00d7-25pancreasM58OO-26pancreasF58\u00d7\u00d7-27rectumM56\u2295O-28rectumF65OO-29pancreasM76\u00d7\u00d7-30lungM50\u2295O-31pancreasF33\u00d7\u00d7-32tongueM62OO-33S colonM58--\u00d734breastF52--O35kidneyM64--\u00d7Healthy Subject 1M62\u00d7\u00d7-2M41\u00d7\u00d7-3F60\u00d7\u00d7-4F33\u00d7\u00d7-5M36\u00d7\u00d7-6M37\u00d7\u00d7-7M42\u00d7\u00d7-8F40\u00d7\u00d7-9M39\u00d7\u00d7-10M39\u00d7\u00d7-11M26\u00d7\u00d7-12M30\u00d7\u00d7-13M31\u00d7\u00d7-14M59\u00d7\u00d7-15F23\u00d7\u00d7-16F39\u00d7\u00d7-17F34\u00d7\u00d7-18F27\u00d7\u00d7<sup>~</sup>19F23\u00d7\u00d7-20F45\u00d7\u00d7-21M40--O22M60--\u00d7 23M28--\u00d724M38--\u00d725F25--\u00d726M38--\u00d727F34--\u00d7Note)Patient: Those who had been diagnosed cancer prior to the test\n\u2003\u2003\u2003Healthy: Those who had not been diagnosed cancer prior to the test\n\u2003\u2003\u2003-: Not tested</p>\n  As shown in Table 1, anti HLA-F antibody was detected\nin 16 out of 35 cancer patients, giving the detection rate\nof 45.7 %. With regard to those patients whose sera did\nnot give positive color development on the filter, there\nwas a possibility that the anti-HLA-F antibody in sera was\nneutralized by cancer cell-specific HLA-F antigen contained\nin the same sera, and hence, anti-HLA-F antibody was not\ndetected.
