    ">II. Nucleic Acids The humanized antibodies and fragments thereof are usually produced by expression of nucleic acids. All nucleic acids encoding a humanized antibody or a fragment thereof described in this application are expressly included in the invention.</p>III. Computers</p>In another aspect of the invention, computers programmed to display three dimensional images of antibodies on a monitor are provided. For example, a Silicon Graphics IRIS 4D workstation running under the UNIX operating system and using the molecular modelling package QUANTA (Polygen Corp. USA) is suitable. Computers are useful for visualizing models of variants of humanized antibodies. In general, the antibodies of the invention already provide satisfactory binding affinity. \n\nHowever, it is likely that antibodies with even stronger binding affinity could be identified by further variation of certain amino acid residues. The three dimensional image will also identify many noncritical amino acids, which could be the subject of conservative substitutions without appreciable affecting the binding affinity of the antibody. Collectively even conservative substitutions can have a significant effect on the properties of an immunoglobulin. However, it is likely many individual conservative substitutions will not significantly impair the properties of the immunoglobulins.</p>IV. Testing Humanized Antibodies</p>The humanized antibodies of the invention are tested by a variety of assays. These include a simple binding assay for detecting the existence or strength of binding of an antibody to cells bearing the VLA-receptor. The antibodies are also tested for their capacity to block the interaction of cells bearing the VLA-4 receptor with endothelial cells expressing a VCAM-1 ligand. The endothelial cells may be grown and stimulated in culture or may be a component of naturally occurring brain tissue sections. See Yednock et al., supra, and USSN 07/871,223. The humanized antibodies are also tested for their capacity to prevent or reduce inflammation and subsequent paralysis in laboratory animals having experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) . EAE is induced by injection of a laboratory animal with CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells specific for myelin basic protein or by directly immunizing animals with myelin basic protein. This protein is localized in the central nervous system, and the reactive T-cells initiate destruction of sheaths containing this protein in a manner that simulates the autoimmune response in multiple sclerosis. See Yednock et al., supra, and copending USSN 07/871,223.</p>V. Pharmaceutical Compositions The invention provides pharmaceutical compositions to be used for prophylactic or therapeutic treatment comprising an active therapeutic agent, i . e. , a humanized 21.6 antibody or a binding fragment thereof, and a variety of other components. \n\nThe preferred form depends on the intended mode of administration and therapeutic application. The compositions may also i"
