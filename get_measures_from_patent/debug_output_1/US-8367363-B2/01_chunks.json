    " target malignant tissue to treatment with a cardiac glycoside was established as follows. Artificial down-regulation of the expression of \u03b13 isoform in human pancreatic cancer cells, i.e. manipulation of isoform content of subunits of Na, K-ATPase, was achieved by transfection of cells with siRNA (silencing RNA) specific to the \u03b13 isoform. The data demonstrate a decline in expression of the \u03b13 isoform (as determined by Western blot (FIG. 4A)). Quantitation of the decreased expression of \u03b13 by Western blot is detailed in FIG. 4B. FIG. 4C demonstrates that the transfected cells, in which the \u03b13 expression has been reduced, lose their sensitivity to treatment with oleandrin.</p>Still further proof of the relative importance of the \u03b13/\u03b11 isoform ratio toward predictability of a therapeutic response by a target malignant tissue to treatment with a cardiac glycoside was established by transfection of Panc-1 cells with \u03b11 subunit isoform. The Na, K-ATPase \u03b11 subunit isoform was transfected to Panc-1 cells, which normally lack \u03b11 expression. The control sample in FIG. 5A is for non-transfected Panc-1 cells, and the \u03b11cDNA sample in FIG. 5A is for Panc-1 cells transfected with the \u03b11 subunit isoform. As a result, the ratio of \u03b13 to \u03b11 was reduced in the transfected Panc-1 cells (FIG. 5B). The sensitivity of the transfected Panc-1 cells to oleandrin treatment was then evaluated. The sensitivity of these transfected cells to oleandrin treatment was reduced as evidenced by the shift of IC50 value of oleandrin from 4.1 nM of non-transfected Panc-1 cells to more than 50 nM in \u03b11 transfected cells (FIG. 5C). Accordingly, the antiproliferative activity of oleandrin was markedly reduced in Panc-1 cells transfected with the \u03b11 subunit isoform.</p>Detection and quantitation of the \u03b13 and \u03b11 isoforms of the Na, K-ATPase subunit can also be accomplished by immunohistochemical staining, such as detailed in Example 27. Cells are immunohistochemically stained such that the \u03b13 and \u03b11 isoforms are stained differentially. The content of each isoform type is quantified and the ratio of content of the \u03b13 to \u03b11 isoform is determined. Differential immunohistochemical staining of the \u03b13 and \u03b11 isoforms can be accomplished by various means. In some embodiments, a tissue sample is stained with two different stains, one stain being used selectively or specifically for the \u03b13 isoform and the other stain being used selectively or specifically for the \u03b11 isoform. In some embodiments, two close but different samples are obtained from the same tissue and stained, such that the first sample is treated to stain the \u03b13 isoform and the second sample is treated to stain the \u03b11 isoform. The amounts of the \u03b13 and \u03b11 isoforms are then quantified, and the ratio of \u03b13 isoform to \u03b11 isoform is then determined. Based upon the ratio, a prediction is made as to the likelihood of a therapeutic response of the tissue to treatment with cardiac glycoside.</p>Quantitation of the \u03b13 isoform and the \u03b11 is",

No. 7,402,325 issued Jul. 22, 2008) in the name of Addington, or PCT International Patent Application No. PCT/US06/29061 filed Jul. 26, 2006, the entire disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference, or by a process described herein.</p>As used herein, the term \u201coleandrin\u201d is taken to mean all known forms of oleandrin unless otherwise specified. Oleandrin can be present in racemic, optically pure or optically enriched form. Nerium oleander plant material can be obtained, for example, from commercial plant suppliers such as Aldridge Nursery, Atascosa, Tex.</p>The extract can be obtained by modified (e.g. ethanol) or unmodified supercritical fluid extraction of a cardiac glycoside-containing plant mass. The supercritical fluid extract can comprise at least one other pharmacologically active agent that contributes to the therapeutic efficacy of the cardiac glycoside when the extract is administered to a subject. It can contribute additively or synergistically to the therapeutic efficacy of the cardiac glycoside.</p>The extract can be prepared by various different processes. The extract can be prepared according to the process developed by Dr. Huseyin Ziya Ozel (U.S. Pat. No. 5,135,745) describes a procedure for the preparation of the extract of the plant in water. The aqueous extract reportedly contains several polysaccharides with molecular weights varying from 2 KD to 30 KD, oleandrin and oleandrigenin, odoroside and neritaloside. The polysaccharides reportedly include acidic homopolygalacturonans or arabinogalaturonans. U.S. Pat. No. 5,869,060 to Selvaraj et al. discloses hot water extracts of Nerium species and methods of production thereof. The resultant extract can then be lyophilized to produce a powder. U.S. Pat. No. 6,565,897 (U.S. Pregrant Publication No. 20020114852 and PCT International Publication No. WO 2000/016793 to Selvaraj et al.) discloses a hot-water extraction process for the preparation of a substantially sterile extract. Erdemoglu et al. (J. Ethnopharmacol.
