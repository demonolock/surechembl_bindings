Structurally, Mcl-1 has a N-terminal end and lacks a typical BH4 domain compared with Bcl2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w. Mcl-1 encodes a long proline-, glutamic acid-, serine-, and threonine-rich (PEST) region upstream of the Bcl2 homology (BH) domain.</p>Zhao et al. report nicotine enhances the antiapoptotic function of Mcl-1 through phosphorylation.

In response to growth factor stimulation, activation of PI3K produces phosphatidylinositol-3, 4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP3) that directly binds to the PH domain and induces a conformational change in Akt enabling PDK1 or mTORC2 to access and phosphorylate Akt at T308 within the catalytic domain or at S473 in the hydrophobic motif, respectively. Phosphorylation of T308 and S473 subsequently activates Akt and its downstream signaling.</p>Parikh et al. report the disruption of PH-kinase domain interactions leads to oncogenic activation of Akt in human cancers.
