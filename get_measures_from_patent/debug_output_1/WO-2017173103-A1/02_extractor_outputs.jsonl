{"raw_mentions": "Skeletally mature, 16 week old, C57B1/6 mice were treated with 20 mg/kg fenoldopam by subcutaneous injection on 7 consecutive days. \nFenoldopam treatment enhances load-induced bone formation (Fig. 9A).\nThe amount of mineralizing surface (rMS/BS) remained unchanged, while mineral apposition (rMAR) and bone formation (rBFR/BS) rates significantly increased with fenoldopam treatment (Fig. 9A). \nOsteocytes were treated with fenoldopam (increase cilia length and mechanosensing), or tubastatin (increase cilia stiffness to impair mechanosensing)."}
