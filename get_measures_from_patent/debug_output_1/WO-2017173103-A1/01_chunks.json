    " was then used for the remainder of studies. Osteocytes were subjected to drug treatment or siRNA-mediated knockdown prior to initiation of flow. Conditioned osteocyte media was used to culture osteoblasts for 24 hours before analysis. </p> In vivo drug treatment and loading </p> Skeletally mature, 16 week old, C57B1/6 mice were treated with 20 mg/kg fenoldopam by subcutaneous injection on 7 consecutive days. Compressive ulnar loading was applied on days 5-7 to mechanically stimulate bone (3N at 2 Hz for 120 cycles) [9]. </p> Primary cilia disruption \n\n Osteocyte primary cilia formation was inhibited by siRNA-mediated knockdown of IFT88 [3, 5]. AC6, TRPV4, and PC2 were also inhibited by siRNA treatment [10]. </p> Statistics </p> All data reported as mean \u00b1 SEM, *p &lt; 0.05 **p &lt; 0.01, ***p &lt; 0.001. </p>(3) Results </p> Osteoblast osteogenic gene expression was enhanced by culture with conditioned media from mechanically stimulated osteocytes (Fig. 6). Osteopontin (OPN) expression was normalized to GAPDH and compared to no flow controls. </p> Osteocytes with longer primary cilia were more mechanosensitive. Fenoldopam treatment increased osteocyte primary cilia length, as well as the OPN and COX-2 response to flow. OPN and COX-2 expressions were normalized to GAPDH and compared to no flow controls (Fig. 7A-C). Osteoblast osteogenic gene expressions were diminished by disruption of osteocyte primary cilia formation (Fig. 7D). Primary cilia were impaired by siRNA-mediated KD of IFT88. Media from mechanically stimulated osteocytes with impaired cilia elicited an abrogated response in osteoblasts compared to scramble control. </p> Osteocyte primary cilia directed osteogenic paracrine signaling. Osteoblast osteogenic response to paracrine signals from mechanically stimulated osteocytes was assessed by osteopontin, OPN, mRNA expression (Fig. 8). Osteocytes were treated with fenoldopam (increase cilia length and mechanosensing), or tubastatin (increase cilia stiffness to impair mechanosensing). Osteocyte cilia formation was also inhibited, IFT88 knockdown, as well as pools of key cilia mechanotransduction proteins - AC6, PC2, TRPV4 (Fig. 8). </p> Fenoldopam treatment enhances load-induced bone formation (Fig. 9A).</p>Skeletally mature mice were administered fenoldopam for 7 consecutive days. Compressive ulnar load was applied for 3 days to mechanically stimulate the bones, while contralateral limbs served as non-loaded controls. Dynamic histomorphometric analysis was performed to asses bone adaptation. The amount of mineralizing surface (rMS/BS) remained unchanged, while mineral apposition (rMAR) and bone formation (rBFR/BS) rates significantly increased with fenoldopam treatment (Fig. 9A). N &gt; 12 for each group. 2-way ANOVA revealed no statistical difference based on gender. </p> Load-induced bone formation was assessed by dynamic histo-morphometry (Fig. 9B). Alizarin (red) was administered four days after calcein (green). Bone formation was \n\n"
