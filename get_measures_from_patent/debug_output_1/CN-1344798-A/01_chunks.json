    "A kind of new polypeptide-human dioxygenase 10.12 and the polynucleotide of this peptide species of codingThe invention belongs to biological technical field, specifically, the invention describes a kind of new polypeptide-human dioxygenase 10.12, and the polynucleotide sequence of this polypeptide of encoding.The invention still further relates to the preparation method and the application of these polynucleotide and polypeptide.</p>The hydroxylation dioxygenase of bacterium ring is multicomponent combined enzyme agent, and it is made of a hydroxylase composition and a transfer transport composition.The hydroxylase composition itself comprises two subunits: \u03b1-subunit of one 50 Kd; \u03b2-subunit of one 20 Kd.Transfer transport composition itself also comprises two subunits: a ferredoxin subunit and a ferredoxin reductase subunit, or an independent subunit with ferredoxin and two kinds of completely different functions of ferredoxin reductase.</p>These dioxygenases contain an aromatic nucleus hydroxylase composition, and hydroxylase has two subunits, and these two subunits are all very similar in different dioxygenases.\u03b1-subunit had both combined the iron-sulphur protein of a 2Fe-2S type in the hydroxylase composition, combine an iron atom again, and \u03b2-subunit does not comprise any observable iron atom or unsettled sulphur compound (Neidle E.L., Hartnett C., Ornston N.L., Bairoch A., Rekik M., Harayama is J.Bacteriol.173:5385-5395 S.1991).At the proteic N-terminal of \u03b1-subunit a conservative region that contains 24 amino-acid residues is arranged, this zone is contained can be in conjunction with 2 halfcystines and 2 histidine residues of iron-sulphur protein.We this zone as a signal mode.</p>Conserved sequence is: C-x-H-R-[GA]-x (8)-G-N-x (5)-C-x-[FY]-H</p>Wherein, 2 C and 2 H are considered to the ligand of [2Fe-2S].</p>The transfer transport composition N-terminal zone of dioxygenase is similar to chloroplast(id) type flavoprotein, and the C-terminal zone is similar to several oxydo-reductase.An independent iron thioflavine albumen is arranged in the transfer transport composition, have the reducing activity of NADH-cytochrome c, electronics is transferred on the aromatic nu"
