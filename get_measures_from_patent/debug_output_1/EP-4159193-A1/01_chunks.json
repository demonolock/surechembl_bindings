    "green numbers 1-8 (green background), respectively. Four unclustered amino acid exchanges which are located in constant regions are designated as \"human-specific modifications\" (hsm's) and are numbered from hsm-1 to hsm-4 (vertical captions in orange). Legend: blue box - signal peptide; red box - alpha helix; red arrow - beta sheat; underlined -surface localization; bold green - important for active site geometry; blue amino acids - conservative exchange (+), red amino acids - non-conservative exchange; red (vertical captions) - amino acid exchanges leading to severe MLD; black (vertical)- MLD with unknown severity; green (vertical) - mild MLD; blue (vertical) - polymorphism.</p>Using site-directed mutagenesis (see Figure 3), the variable domains v1 to v9 and the human-specific modifications hsmi to hsm4 of the human ARSA (dark grey) were exchanged by homologous sequences from the murine ARSA (light grey). The resulting man-mouse chimeric ARSAs were analysed by activity assays as described in Figure 4 and 5.</p>In Figure 4, left-hand side, a Strep-tag was fused to the N-terminus of the full length human ARSA cDNA and the coding sequence of the Strep-tagged ARSA was inserted into the eukaryotic expression plasmid pcDNA3. Amino acids of the parental construct pcDNA3-ASA-Strep were substituted by their murine homologues using site-directed mutagenesis as indicated.</p>In Figure 4, right-hand side: To measure the activity of the murinized ARSA polypeptides, chinese hamster ovary-Ki cells (CHO-Ki) were transfected with the mutated expression plasmids pcDNA3-ASA-Strepmut. Binding of the overexpressed ARSA polypeptides to the mannose 6-phosphate receptors was inhibited by addition of 10 mM ammonium chloride. This resulted in the bulk secretion of the newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes and allowed analysis of the murinized ARSAs in the conditioned media. The activity and concentration of the secreted ARSA was measured with the artificial substrate para-nitrocatechol sulfate (Baum H et al., Clin Chim Acta. 1959, 4, 453-455) and a sensitive sandwich ELISA being specific for the human ARSA (Matzner U et al., Gene Ther. 2000, 7, 805-12). To determine the background activity of endogenous hamster-ARSA in the medium, CHO-K1 control cells were transfected with pcDNA3 (empty vector). The specific activity of mutated ARSA (mU/\u00b5g) was calculated by subtracting this background activity and dividing the result (mU/ml) through the ARSA concentration (\u00b5g/ml).</p>As shown in Figure 5, the variable domains v1 to v9 of the human ARSA amino acid sequence (dark grey) were individually exchanged by homologous sequences from the murine ARSA (light grey). The murinized ARSA polypeptides and wild-type ARSA (hASA) were expressed in CHO-K1 cells and their specific activity was determined as described for Figure 4 - results are provided in Figure 5. Bars represent means \u00b1 SDs of the indicated number of independent transfection experiments (n = 4-22). A statistically significant difference to "
