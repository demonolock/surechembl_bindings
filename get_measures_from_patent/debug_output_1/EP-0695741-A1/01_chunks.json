(6), 496, (1986), etc.</p>Further, the method of using chromium (II) chloride (CrCl\u2082) to cause addition of an alkenyl halide to a carbonyl compound by the Grignard method has been developed by Nozaki et al. [Kazuhiko Takai et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 24, 5281, (1983)]. This method has been discussed in further detail by Kishi et al., which showed that the desired substance can be obtained with a good reproducibility and high yield by addition of a catalytic amount of nickel chloride (II) or palladium acetate (II) [Haolun Jin et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 108, 5644 (1986)].</p>Further, the synthesis intermediate of the method of production of the present invention including the coupling reaction using chromium (II) chloride (CrCl\u2082), that is, the above compound of the formula (XI), is novel. There is no example of use for the synthesis of prostaglandins.</p>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTIONAccordingly, the object of the present invention is to provide novel 7-thiaprostaglandin derivatives which inhibit cell migration induced by chemokines, for example, monocyte chemoattractant protein, MCP-1/MCAF, and is useful as an agent for the treatment of arteriosclerosis, diabetic angiopathy, and the like.</p>Here, chemokines (also known as intercrines) are the generic name for polypeptidic inflammatory/immunoregulatory factors produced by activated macrophages and leukocytes, etc. of lymphoid tissues and inflammatory sites. They are approximately 10 kd basic and heparin-binding protein with four cysteines, which form disulfide bonds. The main activity is a cell migration inducing activity. Interleukin-8, MIP-1\u03b1/\u03b2 (abbreviation for macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b1/\u03b2), MCP-1 (abbreviation for monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), etc. fall under this category. They are one family of cytokines in which involvement in various chronic and acute inflammatory disorders is suggested [for example, see Michiel, D. (1993) Biotechnology, 11, 739, Oppenheim, J. J. et al. (1991), Annual Review of Immunology, 9, 617 to 648, Neote, K. et al. (1993) Cell, 72, 415 to 425, Schall, T. J. (1991) Cytokine, 3, 165 to 183, etc.]</p>Among these, monocyte chemoattractant protein, MCP-1 (also known as MCAF (abbreviation for macrophage chemotactic and activating factor) is a chemokine having a monocyte migration inducing activity which is produced by various stimuli from T-lymphocytes, macrophages, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, endothetial cells, etc. It has been known that MCP-1 induces the accumulation of blood monocytes/macrophages into the sites of inflammation, and activates the accumulated monocytes/macrophages in diseases in which monocytes/macrophages are deeply involved in the progression of the diseases, such as restenosis or reocclusion after trauma to the intima of arteries in angioplasty etc., stenosis or occlusion due to progression of atherosclerosis at the coronary artery, carotid artery, etc., coronary transplantation-associat",
    " \u00b5l). A polycarbonate filter (pore size of 5 \u00b5m, PVP-free, made by Neuroprobe Co.) was affixed between the two. Incubation was performed at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 5% CO\u2082 for two hours. The filter was taken out, then the cells migrating to the bottom surface of the filter were fixed and stained by a Diff Quick solution (made by International Reagents Co.), then were measured by a plate reader (made by Molecular Device Co.) at a measurement wavelength of 550 nm. The mean value of three wells was determined and used as, the indicator of the number of the migrating cells. At this time, the text compounds were added at various concentrations along with the THP-1 cells to the top chambers and the activity in inhibiting cell migration was determined. The percent of inhibition of cell migration was found by dividing the {(number of migrating cells caused by the MCP-1 added to the bottom chamber in the case of the test compound being added to the top chamber) - (number of migrating cells in the case of no test compound being added to the top chamber and no MCP-1 being added to the bottom chamber)} by the {(number of migrating cells caused by the MCP-1 added to the bottom chamber in the case of no test compound being added to the top chamber ) - (number of migrating cells in the case of no test compound being added to the top chamber and no MCP-1 being added to the bottom chamber)}. The results when the concentration of the compound exhibiting 50% inhibition was made an inhibition of IC\u2085\u2080 are shown in Tables 1 to 9.</p>Further the results of investigation of the activity of the test compounds in inhibiting cell migration when using human blood monocytes instead of THP-1 cells but otherwise using exactly the same method are shown in Table 10.\n<img id=\"ib0114\" path=\"imgb0114.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/218449335/EP/19960207/A1/000000/69/57/41/imgb0114.tif\"/>\n<img id=\"ib0115\" path=\"imgb0115.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/218449336/EP/19960207/A1/000000/69/57/41/imgb0115.tif\"/>\n<img id=\"ib0116\" path=\"imgb0116.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/218449337/EP/19960207/A1/000000/69/57/41/imgb0116.tif\"/>\n<img id=\"ib0117\" path=\"imgb0117.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/218449338/EP/19960207/A1/000000/69/57/41/imgb0117.tif\"/>\n<img id=\"ib0118\" path=\"imgb0118.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/218449339/EP/19960207/A1/000000/69/57/41/imgb0118.tif\"/>\n<img id=\"ib0119\" path=\"imgb0119.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/218449340/EP/19960207/A1/000000/69/57/41/imgb0119.tif\"/>\n<img id=\"ib0120\" path=\"imgb0120.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/218449341/EP/19960207/A1/000000/69/57/41/imgb0120.tif\"/>\n<img id=\"ib0121\" path=\"imgb0121.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/218449342/EP/19960207/A1/000000/69/57/41/imgb0121.tif\"/>\n<img id=\"ib0122\" path=\"imgb0122.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/",
    "olume of 3.8% aqueous solution of sodium citrate was added and immediately mixed in. The solution was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 minutes, then the upper layer was used as the platelet rich plasma. The lower layer was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes and the upper layer of that was used as the platelet poor plasma. The platelet rich plasma was diluted by the platelet poor plasma to give a number of platelets of 3.5 \u00d7 10\u2078/mm\u00b3. This was used for the measurement. Note that the measurement of the platelets was performed using an automatic blood cell counter MEK-4500 (Nihon Koden). The measurement of the platelet aggregation was performed by measuring the turbidity using an NBS HEMA TRACER 801 (M.C. Medical). 90 \u00b5l of the platelet solution was inserted in a cuvette, then 5 \u00b5l each of the test compounds was added to give the target final concentration. The result was heated for one minute at 37\u00b0C, then 5 \u00b5l of a 100 \u00b5M aqueous solution of adenosine 2-phosphate (M.C. Medical) was added to induce platelet aggregation. The aggregation inhibiting activity was found from the following formula.Aggregation inhibiting rate (%) = {1-(maximum change of turbidity at time of addition of drug)/(maximum change of turbidity at time of non-addition of drug)} \u00d7 100<img id=\"ib0125\" path=\"imgb0125.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/218449346/EP/19960207/A1/000000/69/57/41/imgb0125.tif\"/></p>Further, the concentration of the compound giving 50% inhibition was used as the IC\u2085\u2080. The results are shown in Tables 14 and 15.</p>(2) Measurement of human platelet aggregation inhibiting activity50 ml portions of venous blood supplied from healthy human volunteers were used to prepare the platelet rich plasma and the platelet poor plasma in the same way as above. The measurement of the platelet aggregation was performed in the same way as above. However, unlike with the measurement of the rat platelet aggregation inhibiting activity, the test compound was added to the platelet poor plasma in advance and warmed for 5 minutes at 37\u00b0C, then the platelet rich plasma was added to give a number of platelets of 3.5 \u00d7 10\u2078/mm\u00b3. At the same time, 5 \u00b5l of 100 \u00b5M an aqueous solution of adenosine 2-phosphate (M.C. Medical) was added to induce platelet aggregation. The aggregation inhibiting activity was calculated in the same way as mentioned above. The results are shown in Table 16.\n<img id=\"ib0126\" path=\"imgb0126.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/218449347/EP/19960207/A1/000000/69/57/41/imgb0126.tif\"/>\n<img id=\"ib0127\" path=\"imgb0127.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/218449348/EP/19960207/A1/000000/69/57/41/imgb0127.tif\"/>\n<img id=\"ib0128\" path=\"imgb0128.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/218449349/EP/19960207/A1/000000/69/57/41/imgb0128.tif\"/></p>"
