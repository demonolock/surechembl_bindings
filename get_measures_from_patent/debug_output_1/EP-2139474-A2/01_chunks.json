    "mogenates were plated onto McConkey agar plates to determine CFU/ml (CFU = colony forming units) of urine or CFU/gram of organ.</p>Efficacy in these experiments was defined as a =2-log decrease in CFU/g organ. The CFU/g for the compounds of the invention are summarized in Table 3 below. Compounds which exhibited a 0-1.0 log decrease in CFU/g are indicated with \"***,\" compounds which exhibited a 1.1-2.0 log decrease in CFU/g are indicated with \"**,\" and compounds which exhibited no decrease in CFU/g are indicated with \"*.\" This data was compared to the in vitro inhibition of SoxS activity or to the concentration necessary to inhibit DNA-protein binding by 50% (EC<sub>50</sub>). Transcription factor modulating compounds that inhibited the binding of SoxS to DNA by greater than 70% are shown by \"***,\" compounds that inhibited the binding of SoxS between about 30% and 69% are shown by \"**<sub>5</sub>\" compounds that inhibited the binding of SoxS by less than 29% are shown by \"*.\" Compounds that gave an IC<sub>50</sub> of greater than 5 \u03bcM are represented by \"*,\" compounds that gave an IC<sub>50</sub> of between about 1 and 4.9 \u03bcM are \n\n represented by \"**,\" and compounds exhibiting IC<sub>50</sub>'s of less than 0.9 \u03bcM are represented by \"***.\"</p>Table 3</p>\n a.

Efficacy of Compound GM in an E. coli Ascending Pyelonephritis Model.</p>The closely related E. coli MarA, Rob and SoxS proteins have overlapping roles in the regulation of resistance to multiple antibiotics, oxidative stress agents and organic solvents. Multi-drug resistant clinical isolates of E. coli have been identified that constitutively express these proteins. As shown in Figures 1 and 2, it has been demonstrated that the MarA, Rob and SoxS proteins are also required for full E. coli virulence in a murine ascending pyelonephritis model. Figure 1 illustrates that kidney tissue of diuresed CDl mice inoculated intravesicularly with ~10<sup>7</sup> colony forming units (CFU) of wild type KM-D E. coli (intestinal fistula isolate) had a constant CFU level for up to 11 days post infection. In contrast, deletion of genes for mar A, rob and soxS from a clinical (intestinal fistula) E. coli isolate (KM-D) removed its ability to colonize the kidneys (Figure 2).</p>Diuresed CDl mice were inoculated intravesicularly with ~10 colony forming units (CFU) of E. coli Cl 89 (clinical cystitis isolate). The kidneys were harvested at 5 days post infection. When compound GM was administered as a single dose at the time of infection, a statistically significant difference (p = 0.003) was noted between the vehicle treated dose group ",
    "ith a plate sealer and incubated at room temperature, shaking on the Titermix, for 30 minutes. Next, the DNA solution was prepared, with enough for at least 20% more wells than were tested. 15\u03bcl (0.4 fmoles) was added per well. Then the DNA was diluted in assay buffer, and vortexed briefly to mix. The plate sealer was removed, and 15 \u03bcl of DNA solution was added to all of the wells, the plates were then resealed, and returned to the Titermix for a further 30 minutes. After 25 minutes, the antibody solution was prepared. 0.4 fmoles of SA-APC and 0.125 fmoles of Eu-aHis were added per well in a total volume of lO\u03bcl. Amounts were prepared sufficient for at least 20% excess. The plate sealer was the removed and 10 \u03bcl of antibody solution was added to every well. The plates were subsequently resealed, placed on the Titermix, and covered with aluminum foil. The plates were mixed for 1 hour. The plates were then read on the Wallac Victor V, using the LANCE 615/665 protocol.</p>Data processing</p>For each plate, the mean control (i.e. signal from protein and DNA without inhibition), mean blank (background signal without protein) and mean inhibitor (POO 1407) LANCE<sub>665</sub> counts were determined. The percentage inhibition by each molecule (each test well) was then determined according to the following equation: \n\n % Inhibition = 100-(((test-mean blank)/(mean control-mean blank)* 100)</p>Compounds that gave 40% or greater inhibition were identified as hits and screened again for EC50.</p>EC so screening</p>The protocol used was identical to that outlined above, except that only 10 compounds were assayed per plate. The testing concentrations started at 10 \u03bcg/ml and were diluted two-fold from 10 to 0.078\u03bcg/ml.</p>EC so Data processing</p>Percent inhibition was calculated as shown above. Percent inhibition was then plotted vs. log (cone. Inhibitor) using Graph pad Prism software.</p>Example 13: Cell Free Protein-DNA Binding Assays.</p>An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using 0.1 M (<sup>33</sup>P)DNA, 5 nM</p>SoxS and 50 ug/ml of transcription factor modulating compound was used to study activity of the compound to interrupt DNA-protein interactions in vitro. Different compounds had varying activities against SoxS in vitro in an EMSA. For example, compound AU was very active, BB was moderately active, and compound BK lacked activity.</p>The measurement of the ability of the transcription factor modulating compounds of the invention to intercalate DNA was performed by a qualitative agarose gel assay. The assay consisted of 100 ng uncut plasmid DNA, DMSO, which relieves DNA supercoiling and converts the plasmid DNA to a single form, and transcription factor modulating compounds AU, BP, BQ, BX and a known DNA intercalator. Unlike the known DNA intercalator, the transcription factor modulating compounds were not found to intercalate DNA.</p>Example 14: Inhibition of SoxS binding to its cognate DNA by Select</p>Transcription Factor Modulating Com"
