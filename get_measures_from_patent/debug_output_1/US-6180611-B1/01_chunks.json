    "ological conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, septic arthritis, corneal, epidermal or gastric ulceration; tumour metastasis or invasion; periodontal disease, proteinuria, coronary thrombosis associated with atherosclerotic plaque rupture and bone disease. The inhibitors claimed herein may also be useful in preventing the pathological squaelae following a traumatic injury that could lead to a permanent disability. These compounds may also have utility as a means for birth control by preventing ovulation or implantation. It can be expected that the pathogenesis of such diseases is likely to be modified in a beneficial manner by the administration of metalloproteinase inhibitors and numerous compounds have been suggested for this purpose [for a general review see R C Wahl, et al Ann. Rep, Med. Chem. 25: 175-184, Academic Press Inc., San Diego (1990)].</p>A number of small peptide like compounds which inhibit metalloproteinases have been described. Perhaps the most notable of these are those relating to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) where such agents act to block the conversion of the decapeptide angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent pressor substance. Compounds of this type are described in EP-A-0012401. Also, related mercaptoamide peptidyl derivatives have shown ACE inhibitor activity in vitro and in vivo (H N Weller et al (1984), Biochem Biophys. Res. Comm., 125 (1):82-89).</p>TNF\u03b1 is a cytokine which is produced initially as a cell-associated 28 kD precursor. It is released as an active, 17 kD form (D-M Jue et al, (1990) Biochemistry, 29: 8371-8377), which can mediate a large number of deleterious effects in vivo. When administered to animals or humans it causes inflammation, fever, cardiovascular effects, haemorrhage, coagulation and acute phase responses, similar to those seen during acute infections and shock states. Chronic administration can also cause cachexia and anorexia. Accumulation of excessive TNF\u03b1 can be lethal. There is considerable evidence from animal model studies that blocking the effects of TNF\u03b1 with specific antibodies can be beneficial in acute infections, shock states, graft versus host reactions and autoimmune disease. TNF\u03b1 is also an autocrine growth factor for some myelomas and lymphomas and can act to inhibit normal heamatopoiesis in patients with these tumours.</p>Preventing the production or action of TNF\u03b1 is, therefore, predicted to be a potent therapeutic strategy for many inflammatory, infectious, immunological or malignant diseases. These include, but are not restricted to, septic shock, haemodynamic shock and sepsis syndrome (Mathison et al (1998) J. Clin. Invest. 81:1925-1937; Miethke et al (1992), J. Exp. Med. 175:91-98), post-ischaemic reperfusion injury, malaria (Grau et al (1989), Immunol. Rev. 112:49-70); mycobacterial infection (Barnes et al (1992) Infect. Imm. 60:1441-6), meningitis, psoriasis, congestive heart failure, fibrotic disease, cachexia, graft rejection, cancer, autoimmune disease, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple"
