    "Jul. 24, 1992 [75]).</p>The ligation mixture was used to transform E. coli K12 JA221(Iq) to ampicillin resistance. E. coli K12 JA221(Iq) cells are deposited with American Type Culture Collection (accession number 68845). Recombinant colonies were screened for the presence of the V<sub>K </sub>insert. Some of the plasmids containing such fragments were sequenced. The V<sub>K</sub>-containing plasmids were designated pBAG 190 (VK1-DQL), pBAG 198 (VK2-SVMDY) and pBAG 197 (VK3-DQMDY), and were deposited in E. coli K12 JA 221 (Iq) cells with the ATCC as accession nos. 69112, 69115 and 69114, respectively. The plasmid containing the alternative VK (PDLN) region was designated pMDR 1025.</p>In a series of experiments, the expression vectors encoding recombinant anti-VLA-4 heavy and light chains are transfected via electroporation and the cells are then cultured for 48 hours. After 48 hours of culture, the cells are radiolabelled using <sup>35</sup>S-cysteine overnight and then the cell extracts and conditioned media are immunoprecipitated by incubation with protein A-Sepharose. The protein A-Sepharose is washed and the bound proteins are eluted with SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The samples are analyzed via electrophoresis through 10% SDS-PAGE gels under reducing conditions. In this way, light chain expression is detected only as a consequence of the light chains being associated with the heavy chains. The expected sizes of the heavy and light chains as visualized in the 10% gels are 50 kD and 25 kD, respectively.</p>Since recombinant anti-VLA-4 antibody molecules, prepared as described in Examples 1-4, may be stably expressed in a variety of mammalian cell lines, it is possible to express recombinant antibody genes in nonsecreting myeloma or hybridoma cell lines under the control of Ig-gene promoters and enhancers or in non-lymphoid cells, such as Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, in conjunction with vector amplification using DHFR selection. Recently, Bebbington et al., 1992 [76] have described a method for the high-level expression of a recombinant antibody from myeloma cells using a glutamine synthetase gene as an amplifiable marker. This GS expression system is most preferred for the production of recombinant anti-VLA-4 antibody molecules according to the present invention. The methods, vectors with hCMV promoters and with 5\u2032 untranslated sequences from the hCMV-MIE genes including cell lines (most preferably NSO) and media for GS expression of recombinant antibodies is described in detail in Bebbington et al., 1992 [76], WO86/05807 [77], WO87/04462 [78], WO89/01036 [79] and WO89/10404 [80].</p>In accordance with the teachings of these publications, NSO cells were transfected with a heavy chain sequence having the VH-AS region sequence [SEQ ID NO: 54] and a light chain sequence having the VK-SVMDY sequence [SEQ ID NO: 66] to obtain a stable cell line secreting a humanized recombinant anti-VLA-4 antibody with high potency comparable to the murine HP1/2 antibody.

    "o times with 0.25 ml of PBS, and the IgG is eluted with Pierce IgG elution buffer (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, Ill. 61105 Cat No. 21004Y or 21009Y). 180 \u03bcl fractions are collected, which are neutralized with 20 \u03bcl of 1M HEPES pH 7.5. Fractions are analyzed for absorptance at 280 nm and by SDS-PAGE. The gel is stained with Coomassie blue. Peak fractions are pooled. 100 \u03bcl (14 ml/ml) is diluted with 100 \u03bcl of PBS and subjected to gel filtration on a Superose 6 FPLC column (Pharmacia, Inc., 800 Centennial Avenue, Piscataway, N.J. 08854) in PBS. The column is run at 20 ml/hour and 1.5 minute fractions are collected. Peak column fractions are pooled, aliquoted, frozen on dry ice, and stored at \u221270\u00b0 C. SDS-polyacrylamide gel profile of the final product is obtained under reducing and non-reducing conditions. In some cases when the sample is analyzed under non-reducing conditions, about 10% of the product is not an intact antibody. Studies in these cases indicate that this product is a heavy-light chain dimer. This has been previously recognized as a problem with IgG4 antibodies.</p>EXAMPLE 7Determination of Relative Binding Affinities of Humanized Recombinant Anti-VLA-4 AntibodiesRecombinant antibodies according to the present invention are purified, as described in Example 6, and are assayed to determine their specificity for VLA-4 and their binding affinity or potency. In particular, the potency of a recombinant anti-VLA-4 antibody was assessed by calculating the half-maximal binding constant (reported as ng/ml or \u03bcg/ml of purified antibody) using two different assays described as follows.</p>1. Inhibition of VLA-4-dependent adhesion to VCAM1</p>The critical function of an anti-VLA-4 antibody is defined by the ability to inhibit the VCAM1/VLA-4 adhesion pathway. It has been previously shown (Lobb et al., 1991a, [81]) that purified recombinant soluble VCAM1 (rsVCAM1) can be immobilized on plastic and is a functional adhesion molecule. Immobilized rsVCAM1 binds VLA-4-expressing cells such as the human B cell line Ramos, and this binding can be inhibited by MAbs to VCAM1, such as 4B9 or MAbs to VLA-4, such as HP1/2. This assay provides a reproducible method to assess the potency of any humanized recombinant antibody. Briefly, the antibody solution is diluted, and the serial antibody dilutions are incubated with Ramos cells, which are then incubated with rsVCAM1-coated plates. The Ramos cells are fluorescently labelled as described by Lobb, 1991b [82], and binding assessed by fluorescence in 96 well cluster plates according to the following protocol.</p>Recombinant soluble VCAM1 was prepared and purified essentially as described by Lobb et al., 1991a [81]. Soluble VCAM is diluted to 10 \u03bcg/ml in 0.05 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, (15 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 35 mM Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) pH 9.2. Then 50 \u03bcl/well is added into a Linbro Titertek polystyrene 96 well plate, flat bottom, Flow Labs catalog #76-231-05. The plate is incubated at 4\u00b0 C. overnight.</p>F",
    " each well and then the contents of each well are transferred to scintillation vials containing cocktail).</p>A volume of 50 \u03bcl of labelled cells should be counted to obtain a total known value added to each well. Then the 50 \u03bcl of labelled cells are added to either a well containing only 100 \u03bcl of 1% NP40 or to a scintillation vial depending on the method used.</p>For antibody blocking studies, 100 \u03bcl/well of murine HP1/2 MAb (anti-VLA-4) typically at 10 \u03bcg/ml in RPMI, 2% FBS are added to the rsVCAM1 coated plates and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature prior to cell binding as described above. MAb HP1/2 (anti-VLA-4) or any recombinant humanized anti-VLA-4 antibody prepared as described herein must be preincubated with labelled cells for 30 minutes at room temperature prior to the cell binding. Concentrations of the antibodies preincubated will vary, but generally concentrations were in the range of about 1 \u03bcg/ml.</p>In these adhesion assays, murine HP1/2 inhibits Ramos cell binding completely at about 40 ng/ml, and half maximally at about 15 ng/ml (10 \u03bcM). The results of adhesion assays as represented by the calculated half-maximal binding constants using humanized recombinant anti-VLA-4 antibodies made according to the present invention are shown in Table III. The number (n) of experiments performed for each value is indicated for the recombinant humanized antibodies. As discussed below, these results generally compare well with the results obtained with the FACS binding assay.</p>The potency of recombinant Stage 0, Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 antibodies having the VK1 (DQL) light chain that had been purified from stably transfected YB2/0 cell lines was measured in the adhesion assay, as shown in Table M. The results showed that there was no inhibition detected in concentrations up to 1 \u03bcg/ml (1000 ng/ml) with the Stage 0-B and 0-C humanized antibodies. The results with the recombinant Stage 3 antibodies STAW and AS having the improved VK2 (SVMDY) light chain showed that the AS/SVMDY antibody was at least equipotent and perhaps more potent than the murine HP1/2 antibody. Certain Stage 2 and Stage 3 constructs showed potencies of about 20% to about 100% of the potency of the murine HP1/2 antibody.</p>2. FACS Assays</p>The binding of humanized recombinant antibodies to the cell surface can be assessed directly by fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis, using fluorescently labelled antibodies. This is a standard technique that also provides half-maximal binding information following dose response measurements. The FACS methods are described in Lobb et al., 1991b [82].</p>Briefly, 25 \u03bcl cells (4\u00d7106/ml in FACS buffer (PBS 2% FBS, 0.1% NaN<sub>3</sub>) on ice are added to 5 \u03bcl of 5 \u03bcg/ml FITC or phycoerythrin (PE) conjugated antibody in FACS buffer, and incubated in V-bottomed microliter wells on ice for 30 minutes. To the wells, 125 \u03bcl of FACS buffer is added, the plates are centrifuged at 350\u00d7g for 5 minutes, and the superna"
