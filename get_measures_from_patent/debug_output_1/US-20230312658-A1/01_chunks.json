Assays for B Cell Activation</heading><p id=\"p-0403\" num=\"0398\">In some aspects, various assays can be utilized in order to determine whether an immune response has been elicited in a B cell or group of B cells (i.e., whether a B cell or group of B cells has become \u201cactivated\u201d). In some aspects, stimulation of an immune response in B cells can be determined by measuring antibody titers. In general, \u201cantibody titer\u201d refers to the ability of antibodies to bind and neutralize antigens at particular dilutions. For example, a high antibody titer refers to the ability of antibodies to bind and neutralize antigens even at high dilutions. In some aspects, an immune response in B cells is said to be stimulated if antibody titers are measured to be positive at dilutions at least 5-fold greater, at least 10- fold greater, at least 20-fold greater, at least 50-fold greater, at least 100-fold greater, at least 500-fold greater, at least 1000 fold greater, or more than at least 1000-fold greater than in non-immunized individuals or pre-immune serum.</p><p id=\"p-0404\" num=\"0399\">In some aspects, stimulation of an immune response in B cells can be determined by measuring antibody affinity. In particular, an immune response in B cells is said to be stimulated or elicited if an antibody has an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) less than 10<sup>-7</sup> M, less than 10<sup>-8</sup> M, less than 10<sup>-9</sup> M, less than 10<sup>-10</sup> M, less than 10<sup>-11</sup> M, less than 10<sup>-12</sup> M, or less.</p><p id=\"p-0405\" num=\"0400\">In some aspects, a T cell-dependent immune response in B cells is said to be stimulated if class-switch recombination has occurred. In particular, a switch from IgM to an IgG isotype or to IgA or to a mixture of these isotypes is indicative of a T cell dependent immune response in B cells.</p><p id=\"p-0406\" num=\"0401\">In some aspects, an immune response in B cells is determined by measuring affinity maturation of antigen-specific antibodies. Affinity maturation occurs during the germinal center reaction whereby activated B cells repeatedly mutate a region of the immunoglobulin gene that encodes the antigen-binding region. B cells producing mutated antibodies which have a higher affinity for antigen are preferentially allowed to survive and proliferate. Thus, over time, the antibodies made by B cells in GCs acquire incrementally higher affinities. In some aspects, the readout of this process is the presence of high antibody titer (e.g., high affinity IgG antibodies that bind and neutralize antigens even at high dilutions).</p><p id=\"p-0407\" num=\"0402\">In some aspects, an immune response in B cells is said to be stimulated if memory B cells and/or long-lived plasma cells that can produce large amounts of high- affinity antibodies for extended periods of time have"
