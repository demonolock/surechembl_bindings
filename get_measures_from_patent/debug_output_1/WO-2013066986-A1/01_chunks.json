    "that is immobilized on a surface of a substrate. In certain embodiments, the polypeptides employed herein can be present on a surface of the same support, e.g., a sensor. </p> [0043] In some aspects, a polypeptide can be a target antigen. The term \"target antigen\" refers to a molecule (e.g., a polypeptide, a carbohydrate, or a nucleotide) that includes one or epitopes that can be recognized by immune system components such as antibodies. Typically a target antigen is capable of inducing an immune response in a subject upon administration of the target antigen to the subject in a sufficient amount to induce the immune response. In some aspects, a target antigen is Factor VIII (FVIII) or a portion thereof, e.g., the A2 or C2 domain. </p> [0044] In some aspects, a polypeptide can be a capture agent. The term \"capture agent\" refers to an agent that binds a target antigen through an interaction that is sufficient to permit the agent to bind and concentrate the target antigen from a homogeneous mixture of different molecules. The binding interaction is typically mediated by an affinity region of the capture agent. Typical capture agents include any moiety that can specifically bind to a target antigen. In certain embodiments, a polypeptide, e.g., an antibody protein, can be employed. Capture agents usually \"specifically bind\" a target antigen. Accordingly, the term \"capture agent\" refers to a molecule or a multi-molecular complex which can specifically bind a target antigen with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of less than about 10<sup>~6</sup> M (e.g., less than about 10<sup>~7</sup> M, less than about 10<sup>~8</sup> M, less than about 10<sup>~9</sup> M, less than about 10<sup>~10</sup> M, less than about 10<sup>\"</sup> <sup>11</sup> M, less than about 10<sup>~12</sup> M, to about 10<sup>~16</sup> M) without significantly binding to other target antigens. In some aspects, a capture agent is a capture antibody. </p> [0045] In some aspects, an antibody can be used to phenotype a target antigen-specific immune response. Examples of such antibodies include capture antibodies, probe antibodies, and target-antigen specific antibodies from a sample. As used herein, the terms \"antibody\" and \"antibodies\" can include, but are not limited to, monoclonal antibodies, multispecific \n\n antibodies, human antibodies, humanized antibodies, camelised antibodies, chimeric antibodies, single-chain Fvs (scFv), single chain antibodies, Fab fragments, F(ab') fragments, disulfide-linked Fvs (sdFv), and anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies (e.g., anti-Id antibodies to antibodies of the disclosure), and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above. In particular, antibodies include immunoglobulin molecules and immunologically active fragments of immunoglobulin molecules (e.g., molecules that contain an antigen binding site). Immunoglobulin molecules can be of any type (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, IgA and IgY), class (e.g., IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgAl and IgA2), or subclass. The antibodies can be from any animal origin including birds and mammals (e.g., human, murine, donkey, sheep, rabbit, goat, guinea pig, camel, horse, or chicken). In some aspects, the antibodies are human or humanized monoclonal antibodies. As used herein, \"human\" antibodies include antibodies having the amino acid sequence of a human immunoglobulin and include antibodies isolated from human immunoglobulin libraries or from mice that express antibodies from human genes. The antibodies can be monospecific, bispecific, trispecific, or of greater </p>multispecificity. Antibodies usually \"specifically bind\" a target antigen. Accordingly, the term \"antibody\" refers to a molecule or a multi-molecular complex which can generally specifically bind a target antigen with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of less than about 10<sup>~6</sup> M (e.g., less than about 10<sup>~7</sup> M, less than about 10<sup>~8</sup> M, less than about 10<sup>~9</sup> M, less than about 10<sup>\"10</sup> M, less than about 10<sup>\"11</sup> M, less than about 10<sup>\"12</sup> M, to about 10<sup>\"16</sup> M) without significantly binding to other target antigens. In some aspects, target antigen-specific antibodies from a sample can be anti-Factor VIII (FVIII) antibodies. </p>[0046] The term \"antibody/target complex\" is a complex that results from the specific binding of an antibody with a target antigen, i.e., a \"binding partner pair\". An antibody and a target for the antibody will usually specifically bind to each other under \"conditions suitable for specific binding\", where such conditions are those conditions (in terms of salt </p>concentration, pH, detergent, protein concentration, temperature, etc.) which allow for binding to occur between capture agents and targets to bind in solution. Such conditions, particularly with respect to proteins and antibodies, include those described in Harlow and Lane (Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989)) and Ausubel, et al (Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, 5th ed., Wiley &amp; Sons, 2002). </p> [0047] The term \"specific binding\" refers to the ability of a capture agent and/or antibody to preferentially bind to a particular target antigen that is present in a homo",
    " antibody phenotype with injection steps and report points annotated. \n\n Example 1: Assay Performance. </p>[0095] Acceptable assay performance was typically achieved for 100-150 cycles with a single sensor chip. FVIII capture capacity declined slowly, but this was not typically a limitation. Frequent inclusion of bracketing injections of buffer before and after the injection of plasma samples was undertaken due to a progressive increase in non-sample-specific secondary antibody binding signal. Therefore, subtraction of reference RU values sometimes caused apparent negative referenced binding signals for samples with very low measured RU binding signals, e.g. the % anti-IgG2 signals from several plasma samples (Tables 1-3). If the response (in RUs) of bracketing buffer injections was reproducible, sample signals were corrected by subtracting the mean signals from the bracketing buffer injections. If not, samples were retested using a new sensor chip. </p> [0096] The use of affinity-captured FVIII antigen placed limits on the dynamic range of quantitative measurements. Although normalized calibration curves using the patient-derived inhibitory antibody B02C 11 were highly reproducible across multiple days and sensors </p>(Figure 1 A) the dynamic range for the SPR assay was narrow, with a range of quantification from 0.2 \u03bcg/ml (~1 nM) to 5 \u03bcg/ml (-33 nM). Below 0.2 \u03bcg/ml, signal to noise ratios were too low to obtain reliable information. B02C 11 binds to FVIII with an apparent dissociation constant K<sub>D</sub> ~ 2xl0<sup>\"u</sup> mol L<sup>\"1</sup> and inhibits its pro-coagulant activity with a specific activity of -7,000 BU/mg [11]; these spike-recovery assays indicated the lower limit for detection of this high-affinity neutralizing antibody by SPR was 0.2 \u03bcg/ml~1.4 BU/ml. Above 5 \u03bcg/ml, accurate concentration measurements could not be obtained due to saturation of the affinity- captured FVIII, but the IgG subtype distribution could still be measured. The spike-recovery experiment with 1.0 \u03bcg/ml (~7 nM) B02C11 demonstrated a recovery of 109\u00b116% (Figure IB). As expected for B02C11 (human IgG<sub>4</sub>), this response was IgG<sub>4</sub>-restricted and the ratio of secondary (IgGi + IgG<sub>2</sub> + IgG<sub>3</sub> + IgG<sub>4</sub> signals) to primary (polyclonal anti-FVIII antibodies) binding RU signals was close to stoichiometric (94\u00b110%). In addition to satisfactory recovery of B02C11 following CA treatment, the behavior of independently treated and tested samples from a given subject, including both citrated plasma and Ficoll- treated heparin-anticoagulated plasma, was reproducible when assayed using different sensors and with different sample preparations. Once treated with CA, the samples remained stable for several weeks at 4\u00b0C. The dynamic range of the SPR assay was from 0.2-33 \u03bcg/ml anti-FVIII antibody, corresponding to -1.4-35 BU/ml for the high-affinity neutralizing monoclonal antibody B02C11 (Figure 1A).
