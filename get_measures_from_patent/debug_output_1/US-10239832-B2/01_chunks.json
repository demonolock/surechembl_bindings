    "own by hydrolase \u03b1-galactosidase.</p>Gaucher disease is caused by a defect in the enzyme lysosomal glucocerebrosidase which is responsible for catalyzing the breakdown of glucosylceramide which then accumulates in tissues of affected people (J. Org. Chem. 2007, 72(4), 1088) causing liver malfunction, skeletal disorders, painful bone lesions, hypersplenism, pancytopenia, and neurological symptoms (convulsions, hypertonia, mental retardation, apnea, dementia, and ocular muscle apraxia). One treatment strategy is to provide the defective enzyme to the patient; however, enzyme replacement therapy is not suitable for all patients and does not address the neurological manifestations of the disease for those with type 2 and type 3. An alternative or complementary strategy is one where glucosylceramide synthase is inhibited with small molecules thus decreasing the amount of glucosylceramide that needs to be broken down by glucocerebrosidase.</p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NALD) is a disease where fat accumulates in the liver of people who drink little or no alcohol and results in inflammation and scarring of the liver which can progress to liver failure. Inhibition of glucosylceramide synthase in ob/ob mice lowered glucose levels, lowered liver/body weight ratio, decreased the accumulation of triglycerides, and prevented and reversed steatosis (Hepatology 2009, 50(1), 85-93). Thus GCS inhibitors are useful for the prevention and treatment of NALD.</p>Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a genetic disease characterized by noncancerous cysts which are filled with fluid and cause the kidneys to enlarge which can result in a decrease in quality of life (e.g., headaches, high blood pressure, back and side pain, colon problems, mitral valve prolapsed, and kidney stones) and can be life-threatening (e.g. kidney failure, aneurysm in the brain, and high blood pressure which can lead to heart disease and stroke). PKD can also damage the liver, spleen, pancreas, vasculature, testes, seminal vesicles, and intestines. Glucosylceramide and ganglioside GM<sub>3 </sub>levels in the kidney are higher than in normal tissue (Nat Med 2010, 16(7), 788). Thus, blocking the synthesis of glucosylceramide with an inhibitor of GCS can be useful in the treatment of PKD to reduce new cyst formation (partial or complete inhibition of cystogenesis), reduce cyst mass, reduce the size and number of cysts, and/or reduce the severity of the symptoms associated. All current treatments for PKD address symptoms and do not treat the underlying cause of the disease (Nat Med 2010, 16(7), 788).</p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIn one aspect, provided is a compound of Formula I:</p><img id=\"EMI-C00002\" path=\"US10239832-20190326-C00002.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/490161434/US/20190326/B2/000010/23/98/32/US10239832-20190326-C00002.TIF\"/>\nwhere\nR<sup>1 </sup>is cycloalkyl or heterocycloalkyl; wherein the heterocycloalkyl is attached to the C(O) group by a carbon atom and is optionally substituted with hydroxy;R<sup>2 </sup>is hydrogen, hydroxy, or alkyl; and R<sup>3 </sup>is alkyl, aminoalkyl, alkylaminoalkyl, or dialkylaminoalkyl; or R<sup>2 </sup>and R<sup>3 </sup>together with the nitrogen to which they are attached form a 3-10 membered heterocycloalkyl ring which is optionally substituted with 1, 2, 3, or 4 R<sup>8</sup>; and wherein the \u2014NR<sup>2</sup>R<sup>3 </sup>heterocycloalkyl is not morpholinyl;R<sup>4 </sup>is aryl or heteroaryl each of which is optionally substituted with 1, 2, or 3 R<sup>9 </sup>groups;R<sup>5 </sup>is halo, hydroxy, \u2014N<sub>3</sub>, \u2014NH<sub>2</sub>, \u2014NHC(O)CH<sub>3</sub>, \u2014NH(OCH<sub>3</sub>), or \u2014NHC(O)H and R<sup>5a </sup>is hydrogen, halo, alkyl, or deuterium; or R<sup>5 </sup>and R<sup>5a </sup>together with the carbon to which they are attached form C(O) or C(NOH);R<sup>6 </sup>is alkyl, alkoxycarbonyl, aryl, arylalkyl, arylcarbonyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, heterocylcoalkyl, heterocycloalkylalkyl, heteroaryl",
