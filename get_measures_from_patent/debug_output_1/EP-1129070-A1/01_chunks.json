(Biochemistry, 30, pp. 6127-6134 (1991)). The assay was carried out at 4\u00b0C with 1 mg chymotrypsin/mL of assay with succinyl-Ala-Leu-</p>\n  Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide as the substrate. Chymotrypsin rapidly hydrolyzes the peptide \n\nbond on the C-terminal side of the Phe of the trans form of the peptide and releases the chromogenic p-nitroaniline. The rate of the reaction is controlled by the rate of conversion of the cis form of the peptide to the trans-form, the reaction catalyzed by FKBP12. The apparent Kj values for inhibition of the rotamase activity were determined by measuring decreases in the first order rate constant of the reaction catalyzed by FKBP12 as a function of the concentrations of the compounds described herein. Ki is the concentration of the compound that causes 50 percent inhibition of rotamase activity which is indicative of neurite outgrowth activity. The results are presented in Tables 1-4.</p>\n  Example 47</p>\n  Assay of Neurite Outgrowth in PC12 Cell Cultures</p>\n  PC-12A rat pheochromocytoma cells are maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 5% calf serum at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cells to be assayed are plated at 10 per well of a 24 well plate and allowed to attach for 4-18 h. The medium is then replaced with DMEM plus 0.1% BSA, submaximal concentrations of nerve growth factor (NGF) (as determined by neurite outgrowth assay), and varying concentrations of the FKBP12 binding compound (O.lnM-lO\u03bcM) in a final concentration of 0.25% DMSO. Control cultures are treated with NGF in the absence of the FKBP12 binding compound. After 72 h, cultures are fixed with 4% formalin in PBS, stained with Commassie Blue, and approximately 200 cells are counted in random fields of each well. Cells with neurites longer than one cell diameter are counted as a percentage of total number of cells.</p>\n  The FKBP12 binding compounds of formula I utilized in this invention cause a significant increase in neurite outgrowth over control cultures. \n\n Additionally, compounds of this invention may also show benefit as reversers of multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer chemotherapy and as agents for the treatment of HIV infection.

    "P12 binding portion of FK506 have shown utility in reversing P- glycoprotein mediated MDR (U.A. Germann, et al., Anti-Cancer Drugs, 8, pp. 125-</p>\n  140 (1997)). In addition, there has been no direct correlation shown between rotamase inhibitory activity and MDR reversing activity (J.R. Hauske, et al., Bioorg. Med.</p>\n  Chem. Lett., 4, pp. 2097-2102 (1994)). In the area of HIV infection, it is known that immunophilins, including the FK506 binding proteins (FKBPs), are involved in facilitating binding of the HIV envelope protein gpl20 to host CD4 receptors (M.M.</p>\n  Endrich, et al., Eur. J. Biochem., 252, pp. 441-446 (1998)), and that FK506 inhibits the growth of HIV-infected cells (A. Karpas, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 89, pp. 8351-8355 (1992)).</p>\n  Table 1.
