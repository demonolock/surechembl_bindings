    " infection. It has been reported that antibody neutralisation of both poliovirus<sup>10</sup> and respiratory syncytial virus<sup>11</sup> occurs even when viruses are allowed to pre-adhere to target cells. It has also been observed that a single IgG is sufficient to mediate neutralisation of poliovirus<sup>12</sup> and adenovirus<sup>13</sup> and only 5-6 IgG molecules are required for rhinovirus<sup>14</sup>. Finally, there are numerous reports of intact antibodies being far more effective than their proteolysed fragments, even than Fab2 that maintain bivalent antigen binding. For instance, Fab2 fragments have been shown to be less effective than intact IgG in the neutralisation of Yellow fever virus<sup>15</sup>, HSV<sup>16</sup> and Influenza<sup>17</sup>, suggesting an Fc domain effector function for efficient neutralisation. TRI 21 -mediated degradation may explain all these phenomena. </p>Brief Description of the Figures </p>Figure 1 : TRIM21 mediates intracellular antibody neutralisation. (A) Confocal microscopy images of adenovirus infected HeLa cells. Adenovirus pre-coated in antibody and detected after infection with an Alexa-fluor546 secondary (red) can be seen inside cells. Endogenous TRIM21 localisation is shown in green and DAPI stained nucleus in blue. A merge of these channels shows localisation of TRIM21 to antibody-coated virions. The images are a Z-projection and the scale bars are 10pm and 2pm in the zoomed box. (B) Cells treated with IFNa, TRI 21 siRNA (KD), siRNA control (HeLa) or IFNa &amp; TRIM21 siRNA (IFNa KD) were infected with GFP adenovirus at different polyclonal antibody concentrations. The level of infection was determined by measuring the percentage of GFP positive cells and for each condition normalised to the levels in the absence of antibody. Adenovirus infection is reduced by 2-logs in cells expressing the highest levels of TRIM21. (C) Western blot of TRIM21 protein levels in each condition. (D) Infection of treated cells with coxsackievirus in the presence of increasing concentrations of human serum IgG. IFNa and antibody operate synergistically to neutralise virus. This effect is reversed by specifically knocking-down TRIM21. </p>Figure 2: TRIM21 neutralises infection independent of cell-type and antibody. (A)</p>Neutralisation of TRIM21 is reversed by knockdown, independent of siRNA sequence or siRNA vs shRNA, in the presence of antibody. (B) TRIM21 neutralises adenovirus \n\n infection in three different cell lines. Neutralisation is enhanced by IFNa and reversed by knockdown (KD). (C) TRIM21 neutralises adenovirus infection when using different polyclonals or an anti-hexon monoclonal IgG. (D) Entry neutralisation is minimal in comparison with TR I M21 -mediated neutralisation. Antibody-dependent TRIM21 neutralisation of virus requires the presence of the Fc domain. Fab2 fragments are bivalent and have the same potential for entry-neutralisation as intact IgG yet they show a limited affect on infection. This is confirmed by knockdown of TRIM21 , which reverses IgG neutralisation. (E) TRIM21 binds to serum Ig . Binding of IgM to TRIM21 was measured as a change in fluorescence anisotropy and fit to a standard quadratic expression (Materials &amp; Methods) to give an affinity of 16.8\u03bc\u039c \u00b1 1.5\u03bc\u039c. (F) Serum IgM antibodies can also be used by TRIM21 to neutralise virus. Knockdown of TRIM21 (KD) reverses this effect and IFNa increases it. Error bars in all panels were calculated from triplicate experiments. (G) IgA antibodies can moreover be used by TRIM21 to neutralise virus. Knockdown of TRIM21 using siRNA (siTRIM21 ) reverses this effect and IFNa increases it. Control siRNA (siControl) has no effect. </p>Figure 3: Mechanism of TRIM21 neutralisation.

The continuous traces represent the Rl signal (left-hand axis) and are an indication of protein concentration. The short horizontal lines represent the calculated mass at each sampling interval (1 s) within each peak (right-hand axis). Analysis indicates that TRIM21 is dimeric with a mass of 107kDa, that IgG has a mass of 154kDa, and that TRIM21 :lgG complex yields a peak corresponding to free IgG and a 1 :1 complex with mass -280kDa.

    ", may covalently link the CDR(s) to another polypeptide chain, or may incorporate the CDR(s) noncovalently. The CDRs permit the immunoadhesin to specifically bind to the desired antigen . </p>The antigen binding antibodies and fragments thereof also encompass antibody mimics comprising one or more antigen binding portions built on an organic or molecular scaffold (such as a protein or carbohydrate scaffold). Proteins having relatively defined three- dimensional structures, commonly referred to as protein scaffolds, may be used as \n\n reagents for the design of antibody mimics. These scaffolds typically contain one or more regions which are amenable to specific or random sequence variation, and such sequence randomization is often carried out to produce libraries of proteins from which desired products may be selected. For example, an antibody mimic can comprise a chimeric non-immunoglobulin binding polypeptide having an immunoglobulin-like domain containing scaffold having two or more solvent exposed loops containing a different CDR from a parent antibody inserted into each of the loops and exhibiting selective binding activity toward a ligand bound by the parent antibody. Non-immunoglobulin protein scaffolds have been proposed for obtaining proteins with novel binding properties. Antigen specific antibodies or antibody fragments thereof typically bind to the desired antigen with high affinity (e.g., as determined with BIAcore), such as for example with an equilibrium binding dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) for the antigen of about 15nM or less, 10 nM or less, about 5 nM or less, about 1 nM or less, about 500 pM or less, about 250 pM or less, about 100 pM or less, about 50 pM or less, or about 25 pM or less, about 10 pM or less, about 5 pM or less, about 3 pM or less about 1 pM or less, about 0.75 pM or less, or about 0.5 pM or less. </p>1b Peptide Ligands </p>Peptides, such as peptide aptamers, can be selected from peptide libraries by screening procedures. In practice, any vector system suitable for expressing short nucleic acid sequences in a eukaryotic cell can be used to express libraries of peptides. In a preferred embodiment, high-titer retroviral packaging systems can be used to produce peptide aptamer libraries. Various vectors, as well as amphotropic and ecotropic packaging cell lines, exist that can be used for production of high titers of retroviruses that infect mouse or human cells. These delivery and expression systems can be readily adapted for efficient infection of any mammalian cell type, and can be used to infect tens of millions of cells in one experiment. Aptamer libraries comprising nucleic acid sequences encoding random combinations of a small number of amino acid residues, e.g., 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more, but preferably less than 100, more preferably less than 50, and most preferably less than 20, can be expressed in retrovirally infected cells as free entities, or depending on the target of a given screen, as fusion",

    "alisation was carried out using ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection System (GE Healthcare). Westerns were stripped for re-probing as per manufacturers instructions with 1 x Re-Blot Plus Strong Solution (2504, Millipore). Loading control blots were carried out with rabbit polyclonal \u03b2-actin (1 :1000, #4967, Cell Signalling). </p>Fluorescence titration </p>Full-length and ARING-Box recombinant TRIM21 was expressed as MBP-fusion proteins in E.coli and purified using amylose resin and size-exclusion chromatography. The BP tag was removed via tev protease cleavage and cleaved TRIM21 was dialysed into 20mM Tris pH8, 100mM NaCI, 1 mM DTT. Steady-state fluorescence titration experiments were performed at 20\u00b0C using a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian) with excitation at 296nm and emission at 335nm, using 15nm slit-widths and a PMT voltage of 850. The quenching in intrinsic TRI 21 tryptophan fluorescence upon titration of IgG was measured with an averaging time of 5s. Each titration was fit using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software) to the quadratic expression F = F<sub>T</sub>R + f ((- (lo - TR<sub>0</sub> + K<sub>d</sub>) \u00b1 ((( lo - TRo + K<sub>d</sub>)<sup>2</sup> ) + (4K<sub>d</sub>TR<sub>0</sub>)) <sup>2</sup>))/2; where F is the observed fluorescence, F<sub>TR</sub> is the molar TRIM21 fluorescence, f is the molar change in fluorescence, (TR<sub>0</sub>) is the total TRIM21 concentration, (l<sub>0</sub>) is the total antibody concentration, and K<sub>d</sub> is the dissociation constant. </p>Fluorescence anisotropy </p>The PRYSPRY domain of TRIM21 was expressed and purified as previously described<sup>4,5</sup>. The protein was labelled with Alexa Fluor 488 5-SDP ester (Invitrogen) and dialysed into 50mM Tris pH 8 with 200mM NaCI. Anisotropy experiments were performed using a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian) with excitation at 488nm and emission at 530nm, using 10nm slit-widths and a PMT voltage of 600. IgM (Athens Research and Technology, Athens, GA, USA) was titrated into 50nM PRYSPRY and the polarised fluorescence averaged over 5s. The dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) was determined by fitting \n\n the change in anisotropy to the quadratic expression given above using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software). </p>SEC MALS </p>SEC MALS was performed using a Wyatt Heleos II 18 angle light scattering instrument coupled to a Wyatt Optilab rEX online refractive index detector. Samples were prepared as described above and resolved on a Superdex S-200 analytical gel filtration column running at 0.5 ml/min before passing through the light scattering and refractive index detectors in a standard SEC MALS format. Protein concentration was determined from the refractive index based on 0.186 ARI for 1 mg/ml, and combined with the observed scattered intensity to calculate absolute molecular mass using Wyatt's ASTRA analysis software. The major species in TRIM21 has a mass of 107 kDa averaged across the indicated region of the peak. The predicted mass of monomeric TRIM21 is 54kDa, making TRIM21 a dimer in solution and not a trimer as previously reported. SEC MALS of IgG gives the expected mass of 154 kDa with small (&lt;10%) levels of dimer mass 325 kDa, which is typical for IgG. TRIM21 -lgG complex resolves as multiple peaks, corresponding to excess IgG with mass and elution volume as previously and a peak with mass ~280kDa. The 280kDa peak is consistent with a 1 : 1 complex of TRIM21 :lgG, where each protein is a homodimer. </p>Complementation neutralisation assay using exogenous TRIM21 HeLa cells were seeded at 1 x 10<sup>5<",
    "lication -competent strain bearing a GFP-reporter gene was used to infect HeLa cells pre-treated with combinations of TRIM21 siRNA and IFNa as described above. Infection time was limited to &lt;16hrs to prevent spreading infection. Endogenous levels of TRIM21 were insufficient to mediate a significant block (infection increases 2- fold upon TRIM21 depletion), however, treatment with IFNa gave an almost total block to infection in the presence of 15 pg/ml antibody (Figure 1 D). Depletion of TRIM21 in IFNa- treated cells recovered infection levels to those of untreated cells, demonstrating that this is a TRIM21 -dependent effect. </p>We confirmed the robustness of this phenotype by examining the effect of different siRNA sequences, cell types and types of antibody. As can be seen in Figure 2A, different TRIM21 siRNA's with different target sequences reversed antibody neutralisation of adenovirus infection by knocking-down TRI 21 levels. Next, we tested a range of cell lines including HeLa, HT1080 and TE671 . A stable TRI 21 knockdown line was established in each case using an shRNA vector based on the sequence of siRNA 2. In all cells, TRIM21 mediated antibody neutralisation of adenovirus (Figure 2B). Finally, we \n\n tested the effect on adenovirus neutralisation of two different anti-Ad5 polyclonal antibodies (Abd Serotec and illipore) and an anti-Ad5 hexon monoclonal (9C12). In every case, neutralisation of adenovirus was enhanced by TRIM21 upregulation and reversed by TRIM21 KD (Figure 2C). It is commonly thought that antibodies neutralise virus by blocking receptor binding and preventing cell entry. However, &gt;90% of the antibody neutralisation of adenovirus we observe is mediated by TRIM21 (for example, at 200 ng/\u03bc\u0399 antibody there are 0.27% infected cells in HeLa controls versus 10% in cells depleted of TRIM21 ). To test which of these two mechanisms dominates in a polyclonal response, we looked at the neutralisation of adenovirus by pooled human serum IgG. We found that the majority of the neutralisation affect (within the concentration range tested) was mediated by TRIM21 (Figure 2D). TRIM21 binds to IgG via the Fc domain, therefore antibody fragments lacking the Fc should no longer be capable of neutralising virus as effectively. To confirm that it is TRIM21 and not receptor blocking that is the primary source of viral neutralisation we treated serum IgG with pepsin. Pepsin cleavage of IgG removes the Fc and generates Fab2 fragments, which are still bivalent and capable of cross-linking antigen. Moreover, Fab2 fragments bind antigen with the same affinity as IgG. We found that Fab2 fragments were no longer able to neutralise adenovirus infection efficiently (Figure 2D). Furthermore, when using Fab2, IFNa treatment or TRIM21 KD no longer affected adenovirus infection. </p>Example 4: Interaction with IgM and IgA </p>The foregoing exampled demonstrate that in order for antibodies to mediate intracellular viral neutralisation they must contain an Fc-fragment and TRIM21 must be present. </p>During the early stages of infection, in which innate immunity is critical, IgM rather than IgG antibodies dominate the antibody repertoire. We tested whether TRIM21 interacts with IgM and if so the importance of TRIM21 in IgM viral neutralisation. To investigate TRIM21 :lgM binding, we labelled the TRIM21 PRYSPRY domain with an Alexa 488 fluorophore and measured its fluorescence anisotropy upon titration of IgM (Figure 2E). The resulting titration curve was fit (Materials &amp; Methods) to give an affinity (K<sub>D</sub>) of 16.8 \u03bc\u039c \u00b1 1.5 \u03bc\u039c. The in vivo affinity of TRIM21 to IgM is likely to be significantly higher however as full-length TRIM21 is a multimer. Complement C1 q, which binds IgM with nanomolar affinity, has undetectable affinity when measured as a monomer<sup>6</sup>. \n\n Next, we tested the effect of serum IgM on adenovirus infection. We found that pooled human serum IgM and TRIM21 operate synergistically to neutralise adenovirus infection (Figure 2F). Furthermore, as with IgG, the neutralisation of virus by IgM required TRIM21. This suggests that TRIM21 works alongside innate immunity and is protective in the early stages of a humoral immune response. </p>The same effect was seen in respect of IgA ",
    "ws that TRIM21 can use IgA to neutralize virus. Anti-TRIM21 siRNA prevents viral neutralisation, whilst IFN-a potentiates it. </p>Example 5: Mechanism of TRIM21 immunity </p>The previous examples demonstrate that there is an intracellular immune response mediated by TRIM21 and antibodies that is capable of preventing viral infection. Next, we examined the mechanism by which this intracellular neutralisation occurs. We investigated the mechanism in three ways. First, we determined how TRIM21 targets antibody and the thermodynamics of interaction. Second, we examined what events subsequent to targeting are required for neutralisation. Third, we asked how virus is neutralised. TRIM21 is a multi-domain protein consisting of RING, B Box, coiled-coil and PRYSPRY domains. We tested the role of these domains in IgG binding using multi-angle light scattering (MALS) and fluorescence titration spectroscopy. Analysis of the MALS data reveals that recombinant full-length TRIM21 forms a stable dimer and not a trimer as previously reported<sup>7</sup> (Figure 3A). Furthermore, when mixed with IgG, TRIM21 forms a stoichiometric complex consisting of 1 antibody and 1 TRIM21 (Figure 3A). Deletion of the RING domain alone resulted in a destabilised recombinant protein, however deletion of both RING and B Box did not affect TRIM21 stability or its ability to dimerise (data not shown). Fluorescence titration spectroscopy revealed that full-length TRIM21 and ARING- Box bound to IgG with a similar dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of &lt; 1 nM (Figure 3B&amp;C). As the monomeric PRYSPRY domain binds with ~150nM affinity<sup>4,5</sup>, this indicates that the coiled-coil domain is required for TRIM21 dimerisation and the simultaneous engagement of both IgG heavy chains. The sub-nM affinity of TRIM21 for IgG makes TRIM21 the \n\n highest affinity antibody receptor in the human body. The evolution of such a high affinity interaction explains how TRI 21 efficiently targets virus. </p>Next, we looked at what happens to the virus after TRIM21 is recruited and the role of the RING and B box domains. As RING domains often display E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, we hypothesised that TRIM21 may target bound virus for degradation via ubiquitination. Cells possess two pathways for degradation of ubiquitinated material - the proteasome and autophagy. To explore the role of these pathways in TRIM21 neutralisation of virus we performed viral infection experiments in the presence of G132 (a proteasome inhibitor) and 3-methyladenine (3-MA; an autophagy inhibitor). The autophagy inhibitor had no affect on infectivity, however MG132 significantly reversed TRIM21 neutralisation of infectivity (Figure 3D). Titration experiments showed a direct correlation between increasing levels of MG132 and reduced neutralisation (Figure 3E). The ability of MG132 to reverse neutralisation was dependent upon the presence of antibody and TRIM21. Moreover, addition of MG132 could not recover infection in c"
