    "t intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations do not affect the potentiating effect of compound 22 on rSlo channels.</p>From these results, we can assume that the neuronal BK<sub>Ca </sub>channels can be activated by compound 22 even at the resting membrane potentials of about \u221260\u02dc\u221280 mV in the presence of marginal free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration of under 100 nM.</p>Example 3Measuring the Activity of Compound of the Present Invention on Xenopus Oocytes We performed experiments to determine the concentration dependence for the effect of compound 22 on macroscopic rSlo channel activity expressed in Xenopus oocytes. </p>Currents were recorded from excised outside-out patches before and after the addition of seven different concentrations of compound 22, from 0 to 300 \u03bcM. Channel activity of rSlo was elicited after patch excision with 2 \u03bcM intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and increased rapidly with the addition of compound 22. Membrane potential was held at \u2212120 mV and stepped to 50 mV for 50 ms. Relative current differences were determined from the currents of control activated with 2 \u03bcM of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and voltage at 50 mV, normalized with control currents and the obtained data points were fitter with a Hill equation (FIG. 5).</p>Addition of compound 22 in the range of 50 nM to 300 \u03bcM enhanced rSlo current in a concentration dependent manner. The normalized relative current-fold increase were well fitted with the Hill equation. The K<sub>d</sub>, the apparent dissociation constant of compound 22, obtained from the best fitting was 4.01\u00b10.75 \u03bcM and the n value, the Hill coefficient constant, was 1.20\u00b10.07 (N=5, p&lt;0.01). Theses results suggest that compound 22 should bind rSlo channel in one-to-one ratio. Further detailed of biological activity and mechanism of the benzofuroindole derivatives on the channel will be reported elsewhere.</p>In summary, benzofuroindole skeleton was compared with a known BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel opener, BMS-204352, to optimizer pharmacophore groups to be incorporated. Being evaluated on the cloned BK<sub>Ca </sub>channels by utilizing outside-out patches of rSlo channel expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, compound 22 was identified as the potent and effective BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel openers with intracellular calcium independent manner. The BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel opener might be further applied to the therapeutic interventions in stroke, asthma, hypertension, convulsion and traumatic brain injury.</p>Example 4Measuring the Activity of Concentration-Dependence Channel Opening of Compound of the Present InventionWe then measured the concentration-dependence of compound 8 of the present invention. As increasing concentrations of compound 8 were applied to the extracellular side of membrane patched, the activation rate as well as the level of steady-state current was increased in a concentration-dependent manner (FIG. 6A). Although we were not able to obtain a concentration of compound 8 higher than 300 "
