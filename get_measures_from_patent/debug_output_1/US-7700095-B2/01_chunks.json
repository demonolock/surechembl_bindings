The nucleic acids, peptides, polypeptides and proteins of the invention are also useful in the development of assays to assess the efficacy of a treatment for preventing ESRD, high blood pressure, cardiovascular diseases, and the like. That is, the nucleic acids, peptides, polypeptides and proteins of the invention can be used to detect the effect of various therapies on renalase expression, thereby ascertaining the effectiveness of the therapies such as, but not limited to, assessment of treatment efficacies for ESRD, high blood pressure, heart diseases, kidney diseases, and cardiovascular diseases.</p>F. Small Molecule Inhibitors of the Polypeptides</p>In addition to antibodies, ribozymes, interfering RNA's (i.e., RNAi), and antisense nucleic acid molecules as disclosed herein, the present invention further provides methods of using small molecules to modulate renalase activity. As used herein, the term \u201cpotential small molecule inhibitor\u201d refers to a small molecule which binds to a selected protein but for which the ability to inhibit a biological activity (e.g., reduce the catalytic rate of an enzyme) of the enzyme has not yet been tested. Following confirmation of such inhibitory characteristic, the small molecule can be referred to as a \u201csmall molecule inhibitor\u201d or, more generally, an \u201cinhibitor\u201d.</p>The term \u201csmall molecule\u201d refers to a compound which has a molecular mass equal to or less than about 5000 Daltons (5 kD), or less than about 3 kD, or less than about 2 kD, or less than about 1 kD. In some cases it is preferred that a small molecule have a molecular mass equal to or less than about 700 Da.</p>As provided in the Examples, the proteins and nucleic acids of the invention, such as the protein having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 2, are involved in catecholamine metabolism. Small molecules that modulate or down-regulate the expression of the protein or agents such as agonists or antagonists of at least one activity of the protein may be used to modulate biological and pathologic processes associated with the protein's function and activity.</p>Pathological processes refer to a category of biological processes which produce a deleterious effect. For example, lack of expression or down-regulation of expression of a protein of the invention may be associated with certain diseases such as ESRD. As used herein, a small molecule inhibitor is said to modulate a pathological process when the agent reduces the degree or severity of the process. For instance, a disease may be prevented or disease progression modulated by the administration of agents which reduce or modulate in some way the expression or at least one activity of a protein of the invention.</p>The small molecule inhibitor of the present invention can be provided alone, or in combination with other agents that modulate a particular pathological process. As used herein, two small molecules are said to be administered in combination when the two small molecules are administered simultaneously o",
    "embane domains (since some membrane proteins, such as type I membrane proteins, also harbor a signal peptide sequence).</p>This strategy offers several distinct advantages: analysis is restricted to novel genes only; it bypasses the cumbersome cloning process, trimming months or even years off of the search for an interesting gene; it allows immediate verification of gene expression in tissues, and of biochemical and function studies. Indeed, using this algorithm, one clone, MGC12474, was found to be highly expressed in the kidney (see below). Thus, this clone was chosen for further study.</p>It was found that MGC12474 encodes a protein with monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity. MAO is a flavin-adenosine-dinucleotide (FAD)-containing enzyme, which converts biogenic monoamines to their corresponding aldehydes. The enzymatic reaction (Massey et al., 2000) catalyzes the oxidation of monoamines via an oxidative cleavage of the \u03b1-CH bond of the substrate to form an imine product with the concomitant reduction of the flavin cofactor. The imine product is then hydrolyzed to the corresponding aldehyde and ammonia. The reduced flavin coenzyme reacts with oxygen to form hydrogen peroxide and the oxidized form of the flavin to complete the catalytic cycle.</p>Rabbit anti-renalase polyclonal antibody was also raised using a synthetic peptide derived from amino acid position 226-238 that is identical between human and mouse. Western blot study showed that this antibody recognized the same 37 Kd renalase-HA fusion protein as anti-HA antibody.</p>Moreover, it was found that renalase is secreted to the blood (see below for detail) in human, further demonstrating the nature of renalase being a secretory protein.</p>In order to facilitate the detection of the protein product, a HA tag at the C-terminus of renalase was engineered. Western blotting with both anti-HA and anti-renalase antibodies revealed a 37 Kd protein in the culture medium of kidney-derived HEK293 cells, indicating that renalase has a functional N-terminal signal sequence, and is secreted in the cell culture model used in these studies.</p>Furthermore, human blood was examined by western blotting using a renalase specific polyclonal antibody. FIG. 3b indicates that renalase is easily detectable in blood. To determine if the kidney is the major source of circulating renalase, we tested if blood levels were reduced in patients with severe kidney disease and decrease renal function. As shown in FIG. 3b, renalase was virtually undetectable in the blood of patients with ESRD receiving hemodialysis.</p>The experiments are described in more detail below.</p>Example 1Identification and Analysis of the Gene Encoding RenalaseMaterial and Methods</p>Bioinformatics Analysis of MGC Database</p>All 12,563 distinct human full-ORF cDNAs available from Mammalian Gene Collection Project MGC as of the date of this experiment, were subjected to 3 rounds of sequential screening. The initial analysis of MGC was conducted on Dec. 24, 2001. First, genes without a GenBank Definition were chosen for more detailed analysis. Second, the predicted amino acid sequences encoded by genes selected in round 1 were analyzed using BLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) and those encoding proteins with less than 20% identity with known proteins were chosen. Third, the presence of putative signal sequences was assessed using SignalP V2.0 (www.cbs",
    "lotting on panels of human tissues. The results depicted in FIG. 1A show that renalase mRNA is highly expressed in kidney with lower levels in several other tissue types. In situ hybridization studies were carried out to determine the spatial distribution of renalase mRNA in various human tissues (FIG. 3). A specific signal was detected in renal glomeruli, proximal tubules (FIG. 3A, left panel), and in cardiac myocytes (FIG. 3B, left panel). This distribution was confirmed by immunocytochemical experiments, as evidenced by the detection of renalase protein in renal glomeruli, proximal tubules (FIG. 3C, left panel), and in cardiac myocytes (FIG. 3D, left panels). These results indicate that high level renalase mRNA expression is tissue-specific, suggesting that it may have functions specific for cells found in kidney, skeletal muscles, heart and liver.</p>To test whether the candidate genes encode secreted proteins, we employed a PCR-based approach to generate transcriptionally active PCR (TAP) fragments that are used directly in in vivo expression experiments (6). In order to facilitate the detection of protein product, we also engineered a HA tag at the C-terminus of renalase (we avoided the N-terminus to preserve the integrity of the signal peptide). As shown in FIG. 4a, we fused the 5\u2032-CMV promoter and 3\u2032-SV40pA to the renalase-HA, we transfected the TAP fragment into HEK293 cells. Western blotting with anti-HA antibody revealed an expressed protein product of expected 37 Kd in the culture medium (FIG. 4b), consistent with the presence of a putative N-terminal signal sequence.</p>Unlike MAO-A, MAO-B and PAO that are either membrane-bound or confined to intracellular compartments, renalase is secreted into the blood, where it is detectable by western blotting. Amine oxidase activity has been measured in human plasma, and is believed to be mediated by vascular adhesion protein 1 (VAP-1), a copper-containing semicarbizide sensitive amine oxidase that is secreted by smooth muscle, adipocytes and endothelial cells (Salmi et al., 2001). VAP-1's substrate specificity and inhibitor profile are very different that of renalase. It metabolizes benzylamine and methylamine, and is inhibited by semicarbizide and hydroxylamine. Therefore, renalase is the only known amine oxidase that is secreted into circulation and that metabolizes circulating catecholamines.</p>Renalase expression appears limited to the kidney, heart, skeletal muscle and small intestine. The kidney exhibits the highest expression level and appears to be responsible for the bulk of circulating renalase. Indeed, renalase levels are dramatically reduced in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who are undergoing dialysis. The possibility cannot be excluded that the metabolic abnormalities associated with severe renal failure could decrease renalase secretion by the heart and skeletal muscles. Nonetheless, it is likely that the kidney is an important contributor to circulating renalase ",
    "mM GSSH.\n</p>Amine Oxidase Assay</p>Enzyme assay of renalase was carried out using an Amplex Red Monoamine Oxidase Assay Kit (Molecular Probes, Cat # A-12214) that provides one-step fluorometric method for the continuous measurement of amine oxidase activity using a fluorescence microplate reader. The assay is based on the detection of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>in a horseradish peroxidase-coupled reaction using 10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxy-phenoxazine (Amplex Red reagent), a highly sensitive and stable probe for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Experiments were carried out according to manufacturer's instruction with a final substrate concentration of 2 mM.</p>Results</p>Structural analysis revealed that renalase contains an amino oxidase domain, suggesting it may play a role in amine oxidation. Therefore, we tested whether it had oxidase activity using a battery of amines as substrates. Renalase fusion protein in E. Coli was generated by cloning renalase cDNA into a Glutathione-S-Transferase (GST)-1-containing pGEX expression vector using the GST Gene Fusion System. As shown in FIG. 4a, renalase specifically metabolizes cathecholamines with the following rank order potency: dopamine&gt;epinephrine&gt;norepinephrine. Its enzymatic activity was unaffected by inhibitors of the FAD-containing amine oxidases, MAO-A and MAO-B (FIG. 4b).</p>The GST-renalase fusion protein was purified to homogeneity using a Glutathione Sepharose column (FIG. 5a). The purified fusion protein has a MW of \u02dc64 KD, in agreement with the MW of GST tag (26 KD) plus the predicted MW of renalase (37.8 KD). Since renalase is highly expressed in the kidney and is a secretory protein, it is conceivable that renalase is present in the circulation and that individuals with ESRD have much reduced level of renalase. When plasma samples are analyzed with the renalase-specific antibody by Western blot (FIG. 5B), we found the levels of renalase in patients with ESRD on hemodialysis are virtually undetectable, whereas the normal individuals have a circulating renalase concentration of about 7 mg/l.</p>We subsequently tested whether renalase has an oxidase activity using a battery of amines as substrates. As shown in FIG. 6, GST-renalase fusion protein has significant oxidase activity when dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine (2 mM) were used as the substrate. Thus, it can be concluded that renalase is novel protein that metabolizes dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine.</p>Example 4Renalase Regulates Systemic Blood PressureHemodynamics Measurements</p>Sprague Dawley rats (150-250 g) were anesthetized with inactin (100 mg/kg). A catheter (PE-240) was placed in the trachea for airway protection and in the left jugular vein (PE-50) for intravenous infusion of a maintenance fluid solution consisting of normal saline with 6.25% bovine albumin, at a rate of 1.5 ml per 100 g body wt per hour. Core temperature was monitored through a rectal thermometer and body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0 C. using a heating pad. Arterial pressure and heart rate were continuously monitored throug"
