{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nRenalase fusion protein in E. Coli was generated by cloning renalase cDNA into a Glutathione-S-Transferase (GST)-1-containing pGEX expression vector using the GST Gene Fusion System. \nThe purified fusion protein has a MW of \u02dc64 KD, in agreement with the MW of GST tag (26 KD) plus the predicted MW of renalase (37.8 KD). \nWhen plasma samples are analyzed with the renalase-specific antibody by Western blot (FIG. 5B), we found the levels of renalase in patients with ESRD on hemodialysis are virtually undetectable, whereas the normal individuals have a circulating renalase concentration of about 7 mg/l. \nAs shown in FIG. 6, GST-renalase fusion protein has significant oxidase activity when dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine (2 mM) were used as the substrate. \nExperiments were carried out according to manufacturer's instruction with a final substrate concentration of 2 mM."}
