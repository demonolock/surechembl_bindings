    "ocesses that can also lead to activation of PLD. \n\nExample 4: Lipoxin Bioactivity Assays</p>\n  Several of the preferred LX analogs (shown structurally as compounds 1 through 8 above) were prepared by total synthesis as described in Example 1. Following preparation and isolation of these compounds via HPLC, compounds were first assessed to determine whether they retain biological activity using the neutrophil adhesion assay and epithelial cell transmigration assays (as described in Nash, S et al, (1987) J. Clin. Invest. 80:1 104-1 1 13; Nash, S et al, (1991) J. Clin. Invest. 87: 1474-1477; Parkos, CA. et al, (1991) J. Clin. Invest. 88:1605-1612; Parkos, CA. et al. (1992) J. Cell. Biol. 117:757-764; Madara J.L. et al, (1992) J. Tiss. Cult. Meth. 14:209-216).</p>\n  Compounds 1 through 8 (10<sup>\"</sup>? - lO'l^M) were found to inhibit neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells and their transmigration on epithelial cells. The acetylenic precursors ( compound 1, 3, 5 and 7) were found to be physically more stable than their tetraene counte\u03c6arts. Compound 7, which did not have an alcohol group in the C 15 position or other modifications in the series, showed no biological activity in the assays. It would therefore appear that a substituent in the C15 position of LX is necessary for the biological activity of at least LXA4 analogs. 15-methyl-LX A4 (compound 2) also proved to inhibit polymo\u03c6honuclear (PMN) adhesion triggered by leukotriene B4 (LTB4) to human endothelial cells with an IC50 of ~ 1 nM. LX analogs 1 through 8 were found to block migration at potencies greater than or equal to synthetic LXA4. Compound 7 was found to be essentially inactive within the concentration range for inhibition induced by LXA4 or other analogs. The results in these neutrophil-containing bioassays indicate that LXA4 analogs with modifications in C15-C20 positions retain their biological action and can inhibit PMN transmigration and adhesion events. The \"bio-half-life\" of compounds 1-8 was assessed using phorbol ester- treated human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells as described in Example 2. These cells converted more than 95% of LX A4 within five minutes of its addition to the cell incubation. LXA4 in this system was rapidly transformed to 15-0XO-LXA4. However, in the same assay, 15-methyl-LXA4 ( compound 2) and cyclohexyl-LXA4( compound 4) were quantitatively recovered in the incubation medium at times up to two hours. These results illustrate that modification in the carbon 20 through the carbon 15 positions prevents the further metabolism of LXA4 by leukocytes.</p>\n  In addition, the stability of the acetylenic methyl ester LXA4 ( compound 1) was recovered essentially intact after 60 minutes of incubation in whole blood (37\u00b0C) ex vivo, as assessed after extraction and reverse phase HPLC. When taken together, these results indicate that LX analogs retain biological action and are resistant to further metabolism in vitro. \n\n Example 5: Effect of 15-epi-Lipoxins' on "
