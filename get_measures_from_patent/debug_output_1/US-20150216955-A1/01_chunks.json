    "able for use in the present invention include compositions wherein the immune modulators are contained in an effective amount to achieve their intended purpose. The dose of an immune modulator administered to a patient should be sufficient to achieve a clinical improvement in the subject or to prevent joint damage or the symptoms of joint damage in a subject at risk of developing joint damage (including subjects at risk of developing RA). The quantity or dose frequency of the immune modulator(s) to be administered may depend on the subject to be treated inclusive of the mode of administration, age, sex, weight and general health condition thereof. In this regard, precise amounts of the immune modulator(s) for administration will depend on the judgment of the practitioner. In determining the effective amount of the immune modulator(s) to be administered in the treatment or prophylaxis of joint damage, the practitioner may evaluate inflammation, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, lymphocyte proliferation, cytolytic T lymphocyte activity and regulatory T lymphocyte function that is specific to aggrecan. In any event, those of skill in the art may readily determine suitable dosages of immune modulator(s).</p>For any immune modulator used in the methods of the present invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. For example, a dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating concentration range that includes the IC50 as determined in cell culture (e.g., the concentration of a test agent, which achieves a half-maximal reduction in NF-\u03baB activity or mTOR activity or Syk activity, a maximal increase in aggrecan-specific antigen-presenting cells etc.). Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans.</p>Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such immune modulators can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50 Immune modulators that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from these cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in human. The dosage of such immune modulators lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. The exact formulation, route of administration and dosage can be chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient's condition. (See for example Fingl et al., 1975, in \u201cThe Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics\u201d, Ch. 1 p 1).</p>Dosage amount and interval may be "
