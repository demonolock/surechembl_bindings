    "nts differ in a few amino acids (see, e.g., Jefferis et al., (2009) mAbs 1:1). Antibodies described herein can be of any allotype. Allotypes of IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 are known in the art. See, e.g., Kabat E A et al., (1991) supra; Vidarsson G. et al. Front Immunol. 5:520 (published online Oct. 20, 2014); and Lefranc M P, mAbs 1:4, 1-7(2009).</p>The phrases \u201can antibody recognizing an antigen\u201d and \u201can antibody specific for an antigen\u201d are used interchangeably herein with the term \u201can antibody which binds specifically to an antigen.\u201d</p>An \u201cisolated antibody,\u201d as used herein, is intended to refer to an antibody which is substantially free of other antibodies having different antigenic specificities (e.g., an isolated antibody that specifically binds to L1CAM is substantially free of antibodies that specifically bind antigens other than L1CAM). An isolated antibody that specifically binds to an epitope of L1CAM can, however, have cross-reactivity to other L1CAM proteins from different species.</p>\u201cBinding affinity\u201d generally refers to the strength of the sum total of non-covalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g., an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, \u201cbinding affinity\u201d refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1:1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., antibody and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>). Affinity can be measured and/or expressed in a number of ways known in the art, including, but not limited to, equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>), and equilibrium association constant (K<sub>A</sub>). The K<sub>D </sub>is calculated from the quotient of k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on </sub>and is expressed as a molar concentration (M), whereas K<sub>A </sub>is calculated from the quotient of k<sub>on</sub>/k<sub>off</sub>. k<sub>on </sub>refers to the association rate constant of, e.g., an antibody to an antigen, and k<sub>off </sub>refers to the dissociation of, e.g., an antibody to an antigen. The k<sub>on </sub>and k<sub>off </sub>can be determined by techniques known to one of ordinary skill in the art, such as immunoassays (e.g., enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)), BIACORE\u00ae, BLI (Bio-layer interferometry), or kinetic exclusion assay (KINEXA\u00ae).</p>As used herein, the terms \u201cspecifically binds,\u201d \u201cspecifically recognizes,\u201d \u201cspecific binding,\u201d \u201cselective binding,\u201d and \u201cselectively binds,\u201d are analogous terms in the context of antibodies and refer to molecules (e.g., antibodies) that bind to an antigen (e.g., epitope or immune complex) as such binding is understood by one skilled in the art. For example, a molecule that specifically binds to an antigen can bind to other peptides or polypeptides, generally with lower affinity as determined by, e.g., immunoassays, BIACORE\u00ae, KINEXA\u00ae 3000 instrument (Sapidyne Instruments, Boise, ID), or other assays known in the art. In a specific aspect, molecules that specifically bind to an antigen bind to the antigen with a K<sub>A </sub>that is at least 2 logs, 2.5 logs, 3 logs, 4 logs or greater than the K<sub>A </sub>when the molecules bind to another antigen.</p>Antibodies typically bind specifically to their cognate antigen with high affinity, reflected by a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>\u22125 </sup>to 10<sup>\u221211 </sup>M or less. Any K<sub>D </sub>greater than about 10<sup>\u22124 </sup>M is generally considered to indicate nonspecific binding. As used herein, an antibody that \u201cbinds specifically\u201d to an antigen refers to an antibody that binds to the antigen and substantially identical antigens with high affinity, which means having a K<sub>D </sub>of 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>M or less, preferably 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M or less, even more preferably 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>M or less, and most preferably between 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M and 10<sup>\u221210 </sup>M or less, when determined by, e.g., immunoassays (e.g., ELISA) surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology in a BIACORE\u2122 2000 instrument using the predetermined antigen, or BLI (Bio-layer interferometry) but does not bind with high affinity to unrelated antigens.</p>As used herein, the term \u201cantigen\u201d refers to any natural or synthetic immunogenic substance, such as a protein, peptide, or hapten. An antigen can be L1CAM or a fragment thereof.</p>As used herein, an \u201cepitope\u201d is a term in the art and refers to a localized region of an antigen to which an antibody can specifically bind. An epitope can be, for example, contiguous amino acids of a polypeptide (linear or contiguous epitope) or an epitope can, for example, come together from two or more non-contiguous regions of a polypeptide or polypeptides (conformational, non-linear, discontinuous, or non-contiguous epitope). Epitopes formed from cont",

Two antibodies \u201ccross-compete\u201d if antibodies block each other both ways by at least 50%, i.e., regardless of whether one or the other antibody is contacted first with the antigen in the competition experiment.</p>Competitive binding assays for determining whether two antibodies compete or cross-compete for binding include: competition for binding to cells expressing L1CAM, e.g., by flow cytometry, such as described in the Examples. Other methods include: SPR (e.g., BIACORE\u00ae), BLI (Bio-layer interferometry), solid phase direct or indirect radioimmunoassay (RIA), solid phase direct or indirect enzyme immunoassay (EIA), sandwich competition assay (see Stahli et al., Methods in Enzymology 9:242 (1983)); solid phase direct biotin-avidin EIA (see Kirkland et al., J. Immunol. 137:3614 (1986)); solid phase direct labeled assay, solid phase direct labeled sandwich assay (see Harlow and Lane, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Press (1988)); solid phase direct label RIA using 1-125 label (see Morel et al., Mol. Immunol. 25(1):7 (1988)); solid phase direct biotin-avidin EIA (Cheung et al., Virology 176:546 (1990)); and direct labeled RIA. (Moldenhauer et al., Scand. J. Immunol. 32:77 (1990)).</p>As used herein, the terms \u201cspecific binding,\u201d \u201cselective binding,\u201d \u201cselectively binds,\u201d and \u201cspecifically binds,\u201d refer to antibody binding to an epitope on a predetermined antigen. Typically, the antibody (i) binds with an equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of approximately less than 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, such as approximately less than 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>M or 10<sup>\u221210 </sup>M or even lower when determined by, e.g., surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology in a BIACORE\u00ae 2000 instrument using the predetermined antigen, e.g., recombinant human MICA or MICB, as the analyte and the antibody as the ligand, or Scatchard analysis of binding of the antibody to antigen positive cells, and (ii) binds to the predetermined antigen with an affinity that is at least two-fold greater than its affinity for binding to a non-specific antigen (e.g., BSA, casein) other than the predetermined antigen or a closely-related antigen. Accordingly, an antibody that \u201cspecifically binds to human L1CAM\u201d refers to an antibody that binds to soluble or cell bound human L1CAM with a K<sub>D </sub>of 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>M or less, such as approximately less than 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>M or 10<sup>\u221210 </sup>M or even lower. An antibody that \u201ccross-reacts with cynomolgus L1CAM\u201d refers to an antibody that binds to cynomolgus L1CAM with a K<sub>D </sub>of 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>M or less, such as approximately less than 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M, 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>M or 10<sup>\u221210 </sup>M or even lower. In some aspects, such antibodies that do not cross-react with L1CAM from a non-human species exhibit essentially undetectable binding against these proteins in standard binding assays.</p>The term \u201ck<sub>assoc</sub>\u201d or \u201ck<sub>a</sub>\u201d, as used herein, is intended to refer to the association rate of a particular antibody-antigen interaction, whereas the term \u201ck<sub>dis</sub>\u201d or \u201ck<sub>d</sub>,\u201d as used herein, is intended to refer to the dissociation rate of a particular antibody-antigen interaction. The term \u201cK<sub>D</sub>\u201d, as used herein, is intended to refer to the dissociation constant, which is obtained from the ratio of k<sub>d </sub>to k<sub>a </sub>(i.e., k<sub>d</sub>/k<sub>a</sub>) and is expressed as a molar concentration (M). K<sub>D </sub>values for antibodies can be determined using methods well established in the art. Available methods for determining the K<sub>D </sub>of an antibody include surface plasmon resonance, a biosensor system such as a BIACORE\u00ae, BLI (Bio-layer interferometry) system or flow cytometry and Scatchard analysis.</p>As used herein, the term \u201chigh affinity\u201d for an IgG antibody refers to an antibody having a K<sub>D </sub>of 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M or less, 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>M or less, or 10<sup>\u221210 </sup>M or less for a target antigen. However, \u201chigh affinity\u201d binding can vary for other antibody isotypes. For example, \u201chigh affinity\u201d binding for an IgM isotype refers to an antibody having a K<sub>D </sub>of 10<sup>\u221210 </sup>M or less, or 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M or less.</p>The term \u201cEC<sub>50</sub>\u201d in the context of an in vitro or in vivo assay using an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof, refers to the concentration of an antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof that induces a response that is 50% of the maximal response, i.e., halfway between the maximal response and the baseline.</p>A \u201cbispecific\u201d or \u201cbifunctional antibody\u201d is an artificial hybrid antibody having two different heavy/light chain pairs and two different binding sites. Bispecific antibodies can be produced by a variety of methods incl",
    "ying the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof obtained from the cell or host cell.</p>Methods for producing polyclonal antibodies are known in the art (see, for example, Chapter 11 in: Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, (2002) 5th Ed., Ausubel F M et al., eds., John Wiley and Sons, New York).</p>Monoclonal antibodies can be prepared using a wide variety of techniques known in the art including the use of hybridoma, recombinant, and phage display technologies, or a combination thereof. For example, monoclonal antibodies can be produced using hybridoma techniques including those known in the art and taught, for example, in Harlow E &amp; Lane D, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2nd ed. 1988); Hammerling G J et al., in: Monoclonal Antibodies and T-Cell Hybridomas 563 681 (Elsevier, N.Y., 1981). The term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d as used herein is not limited to antibodies produced through hybridoma technology. For example, monoclonal antibodies can be produced recombinantly from host cells exogenously expressing an antibody described herein or a fragment thereof, for example, light chain and/or heavy chain of such antibody.</p>In specific aspects, a \u201cmonoclonal antibody,\u201d as used herein, is an antibody produced by a single cell (e.g., hybridoma or host cell producing a recombinant antibody), wherein the antibody immunospecifically binds to L1CAM (e.g., human L1CAM) as determined, e.g., by ELISA or other antigen-binding or competitive binding assay known in the art or in the Examples provided herein. In particular aspects, a monoclonal antibody can be a chimeric antibody or a humanized antibody. In certain aspects, a monoclonal antibody is a monovalent antibody or multivalent (e.g., bivalent) antibody. In particular aspects, a monoclonal antibody is a monospecific or multispecific antibody (e.g., bispecific antibody). Monoclonal antibodies described herein can, for example, be made by the hybridoma method as described in Kohler G &amp; Milstein C (1975) Nature 256: 495 or can, e.g., be isolated from phage libraries using the techniques as described herein, for example. Other methods for the preparation of clonal cell lines and of monoclonal antibodies expressed thereby are well known in the art (see, for example, Chapter 11 in: Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, (2002) 5th Ed., Ausubel F M et al., supra).</p>Methods for producing and screening for specific antibodies using hybridoma technology are routine and well known in the art. For example, in the hybridoma method, a mouse or other appropriate host animal, such as a sheep, goat, rabbit, rat, hamster or macaque monkey, is immunized to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein (e.g., human L1CAM) used for immunization. Alternatively, lymphocytes can be immunized in vitro. Lymphocytes then are fused with myeloma cells using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to f",
    " growth or survival of the unfused, parental myeloma cells. For example, if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT medium), which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.</p>Specific aspects employ myeloma cells that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level production of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. Among these myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines, such as NSO cell line or those derived from MOPC-21 and MPC-11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, CA, USA, and SP-2 or X63-Ag8.653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD, USA. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor D (1984) J Immunol 133: 3001-5; Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987)).</p>Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against L1CAM (e.g., human L1CAM). The binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by methods known in the art, for example, immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA).</p>After hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity, affinity, and/or activity, the clones can be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (Goding J W (Ed), Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, supra). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, D-MEM or RPMI 1640 medium. In addition, the hybridoma cells can be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal.</p>The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium, ascites fluid, or serum by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography.</p>Antibodies described herein include antibody fragments which recognize specific L1CAM (e.g., human L1CAM) and can be generated by any technique known to those of skill in the art. For example, Fab and F(ab\u2032)2 fragments described herein can be produced by proteolytic cleavage of immunoglobulin molecules, using enzymes such as papain (to produce Fab fragments) or pepsin (to produce F(ab\u2032)2 fragments). A Fab fragment corresponds to one of the two identical arms of an antibody molecule and contains the complete light chain paired with the VH and CH1 domains of the heavy chain. A F(ab\u2032)2 fragment contains the two antigen-bindi"
