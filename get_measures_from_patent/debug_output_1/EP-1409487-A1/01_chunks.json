Wee 1 OY assay</p>These kinase assays are carried out on 96-well filter plates (Millpore, Cat. MADPN0B50) in 50 \u03bcL kinase assay buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 \u03bcM ATP with 0.25 \u03bcCi [r-32P]ATP, 1 mM DTT) with</p>0.1 \u03bcg purified N-terminal truncated Wee 1 and 6 \u03bcg poly(Orn, Tyr)4: 1 (Sigma, P4534). The assay is started by adding ATP and incubating at room temperature for 20 minutes with shaking. The reactions are terminated by adding 50 \u03bcL ice- cold 20% TCA (trichloracetic acid) with 0.1 M sodium pyrophosphate and shaking the resultant mixture for 1 minute. The plate is then incubated at 4\u00b0C for</p>1 hour to allow protein to precipitate. These plates are then washed 5 times with 200 \u03bcL ice-cold 10% TCA and with 0.1 M sodium pyrophosphate per wash. Twenty-five microliters scintillation liquid is then added to each well, and the plate is counted in Wallac's MicroBeta counter 1450. Results for several ofthe pteridines ofthe invention are shown in Table 2.</p>2. Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4 (CDK4) Assay</p>Enzyme assays for IC50 determinations (Table 1) and kinetic evaluation were performed in 96-well filter plates (Millipore MADVN6550). The total volume was 0.1 mL containing a final concentration of 20 mM TRIS \n\n(tris[hydroxmethyl]aminomethane), at pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol,</p>10 mM mgCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 \u03bcM ATP containing 0.25 \u03bcCi of [<sup>32</sup>P]ATP, 20 ng of cdk4/cyclin Dj complex, 1 \u03bcg of retinoblastoma and appropriate dilutions of a compound ofthe present invention. All components except the ATP were added to the wells, and the plate was placed on a plate mixer for 2 minutes. The reaction was started by adding [<sup>3</sup> P]ATP and the plate incubated at 25\u00b0C for 15 minutes. The reaction was terminated by addition of 0.1 mL of 20% TCA. The plate was kept at 4\u00b0C for at least 1 hour to allow the substrate to precipitate. The wells were then washed five times with 0.2 mL of 10% TCA and <sup>32</sup>P inco\u03c6oration determined with a beta plate counter (Wallac Inc., Gaithersburg, Maryland).</p>3. PDGF and FGF Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Assays</p>Full-length cDNAs for the mouse PDGF-\u03b2 and human FGF-1 (fig) receptor tyrosine kinases were obtained from J. Escobedo and prepared as described in J. Biol. Chem., 1991;262:1482-1487. PCR primers were designed to amplify a fragment of DNA that codes for the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. The fragment was inserted into a baculovirus vector, cotransfected with AcMNPV DNA, and the recombinant virus isolated. SF9 insect cells were infec",
    "virus to overexpress the protein, and the cell lysate was used for the assay. Assays were performed in 96-well plates (100 \u03bcL/incubation/well), and conditions were optimized to measure the inco\u03c6oration of <sup>32</sup>P from \u03b3<sup>32</sup>P-ATP into a glutamate-tyrosine co-polymer substrate. Briefly, to each well was added 82.5 \u03bcL of incubation buffer containing 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.0), 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mM PMSF, 0.2 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM MnCl2, and</p>750 \u03bcg/mL of Poly (4: 1) glutamate-tyrosine followed by 2.5 \u03bcL of inhibitor and 5 \u03bcL of enzyme lysate (7.5 \u03bcg/\u03bcL FGF-TK or 6.0 \u03bcg/\u03bcL PDGF-TK) to initiate the reaction. Following a 10 minute incubation at 25\u00b0C, 10 mL of \u03b3<sup>3</sup> P-ATP (0.4 \u03bcCi plus 50 \u03bcM ATP) was added to each well, and samples were incubated for an additional 10 minutes at 25\u00b0C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 100 \u03bcL of 30% TCA containing 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate and precipitation of material onto glass fiber mats (Wallac). Filters were washed three times with \n\n15% TCA containing 100 mM sodium pyrophosphate, and the radioactivity retained on the filters counted in a Wallac 1250 Betaplate reader. Nonspecific activity was defined as radioactivity retained on the filters following incubation of samples with buffer alone (no enzyme). Specific enzymatic activity (enzyme plus buffer) was defined as total activity minus nonspecific activity. The concentration of a compound that inhibited specific activity by 50% (IC50) was determined based on the inhibition curve.</p>4. C-src Kinase Assays</p>C-src kinase was purified from baculovirus infected insect cell lysates using an antipeptide monoclonal antibody directed against the N-terminal amino acids (amino acids 2-17) of c-src. The antibody, covalently linked to 0.65 \u03bcm latex beads, was added to a suspension of insect cell lysis buffer comprised of 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 1% NP-40, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 1 mM PMSF, 1 \u03bcg mL each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin. Insect cell lysate containing c-src protein was incubated with these beads for 3 to 4 hours at 4\u00b0C with rotation. At the end ofthe lysate incubation, the beads were rinsed three times in lysis buffer, resuspended in lysis buffer containing 10% glycerol, and frozen. These latex beads were thawed, rinsed three times in assay buffer (40 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mM mgC-2) and suspended in the same buffer. In a Millipore 96-well plate with a 0.65 \u03bcm polyvinylidine membrane bottom were added the reaction components: 10 \u03bcL C-src beads, 10 \u03bcL of 2.5 mg/mL poly GluTyr substrate, 5 \u03bcM ATP containing 0.2 \u03bcCi labeled</p><sup>32</sup>P-ATP, 5 \u03bcL DMSO containing inhibitors or as a solvent control, and buffer to make the final volume 125 \u03bcL. The reaction was started at room temperature by addition ofthe ATP and quenched 10 minutes later by the addition of 125 \u03bcL of</p>30% TCA, 0.1 M sodium pyrophosphate for 5 minutes on ice. The plate was then filtered and the wells washed with two 250 mL aliquots of 15% TCA, 0.1 M pyrophosphate. The filters were then punched, counted in a liquid scintillation counter, and the data examined for inhibitory activity in comparison to a known inhibitor such as erbstatin. The method is also described in J. Med. Chem.,</p>1994;37:598-609. \n\n5. Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Assays (cdk2/cyclinE, cdk2/cyclinA, cdc2/cyclinB)</p>Enzyme assays for IC50 determinations and kinetic evaluation were performed in a 96-well filter plate (Millipore MADVN6550) in a total volume of 0.1 mL of 20 mM TRIS, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol,</p>10 mM MgCl2, 12 \u03bcM ATP containing 0.25 \u03bcCi of [<sup>32</sup>P]ATP, 20 ng of enzyme</p>(either cdk2/cyclinE, cdk2/cyclinA, or cdc2/cyclinB), 1 \u03bcg retinoblastoma, and appropriate dilutions ofthe particular invention compound. All components except the ATP were added to the wells, and the plate was placed on a plate mixer for 2 minutes.
