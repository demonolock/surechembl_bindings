{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences/rows that meet the criteria:\n\n\nThe concentration of a compound that inhibited specific activity by 50% (IC50) was determined based on the inhibition curve.\nSeveral ofthe invention compounds exhibited good inhibitory activity when evaluated in the foregoing assays, as illustrated by the data in Table 2.\nIC50 means the concentration of test compound in micromoles to inhibit the activity of a specified kinase by 50 percent.\n\n\nNote that there are no specific molecule names, IDs, or other identifiers mentioned in the provided text snippet, along with a bioactivity metric, a specific numeric value, and a unit. The text mainly describes methods and calculations in general terms. However, the above sentences provide some context about the IC50 metric. \n\nIf you provide more text or context, I may be able to extract more relevant information."}
