The substance \"methyl 4-cyano-3-[(2E)-2-[cyano(thiophen-2-ylsulfonyl)methylidene]hydrazinyl]thiophene-2-carboxylate\" is published on Pubchem Database, September 11, 2005; CID 6376145, https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/6376145.</p><heading id=\"h0003\"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b></heading><p id=\"p0016\" num=\"0016\">It is now disclosed for the first time that small organic molecules may act as inhibitors of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) including but not limited to BMP2. It is further disclosed that molecules that are selected on the basis of their ability to inhibit BMPs are useful in the treatment of neuroinflammatory disorders, in particular multiple sclerosis.</p><p id=\"p0017\" num=\"0017\">The invention is defined by the appended set of claims solely. Described subject matter beyond the scope of the claims is to be considered for illustration only. References to methods of treatment are to be interpreted as as references to compounds or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention for use in those methods, respectively.</p><p id=\"p0018\" num=\"0018\">According to some aspects of the invention, small organic molecules capable of inhibiting BMP2 with an IC50 lower than 10 \u00b5M are provided. According to further aspects of the invention, small organic molecules capable of inhibiting both BMP2 and BMP4 are provided. According to yet further aspects small organic molecules capable<!-- EPO <DP n=\"4\"> --> of inhibiting BMP2 are provided in pharmaceutical compositions useful for the treatment neuroinflammatory diseases, including but not limited to multiple sclerosis.</p><p id=\"p0019\" num=\"0019\">The present invention is based in part on the finding that small organic compounds of the Formula (Ia), as well as specific compounds designated herein SM1, SM6, SM7 and SM9 inhibited the activity of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) in a cell based assay. Furthermore, these molecules inhibited disease progression in an animal model of relapsing/remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (RR-EAE), a well-established model mimicking multiple sclerosis (MS). Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory of a mechanism of action, these small organic molecules appear to induce neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis, and to maintain the amount of myelin, by inhibiting demyelination, inducing remyelination, or both.</p><p id=\"p0020\" num=\"0020\">According to some embodiments, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of Formula (Ia) or a salt thereof:\n<chemistry id=\"chem0001\" num=\"0001\"><img id=\"ib0001\" path=\"imgb0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/1067002020/EP/20230607"
