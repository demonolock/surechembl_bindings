    "ples were assayed using HPLC. The system comprised of a Rainin Dynamax Pump SD-200, Rainin Dynamax UV Detector UV-C at 254 nm, a HP 1100 series Fluorescence Detector at ex \u03bb=285 nm, em \u03bb=370 nm and an Alcott autosampler Model 718 AL HPLC. The column used was a C18 Luna column 4.6\u00d7250 mm (Phenomenex). The mobile phase consisted of a mixture of buffer and an organic modifier. The percentage of organic phase was varied in order to elute compounds of interest. This method gave rapid and reproducible results. HPLC conditions for the various compounds have been summarized in Table 1. </p> Data Analysis </p> Permeability Measurements across Caco-2 monolayers: Steady State Fluxes (SSF) were determined from the slope of the cumulative amount of drug transported versus time graph and expressed per unit of cross sectional surface area of the membrane as described by Eq. 1. The cumulative amount of drug transported is the sum of the receptor cell ACV derivative and the regenerated ACV. \n\nFlux (j)=(dM/dt)/A \u2003\u2003Eq. 1 \n</p> M is the cumulative amount of drug transported and A is the cross sectional surface area exposed to permeant. Caco-2 membrane permeabilities are determined by normalizing the SSF to the donor concentration, Cd according to Eq. 2. \n\nPermeability(P<sub>app</sub>)=Flux/C<sub>d </sub>\u2003\u2003Eq. 2 \n</p> Affinity Calculations: The concentration dependent uptake of [<sup>3</sup>H] glycylsarcosine was fitted to the modified Michaelis-Menten equation described in Eq. 3:  \nV=Vmax*CKm+C+Kd*CEq.\u2003\u20623\n</p> Eq. 3 takes into account both the carrier mediated process (as described by the classical Michaelis-Menten equation) and the non-saturable passive diffusion process. V represents the total rate of uptake. V<sub>max </sub>is the maximum rate of uptake for the carrier mediated process, K<sub>m </sub>is the permeant concentration where half the maximal rate is reached and K<sub>d </sub>is the rate constant for the non-saturable diffusion component. Concentration dependent transport of GVCAV was fitted to the classical Michaelis-Menten equation, which takes into account only the saturable component. K<sub>m</sub>, V<sub>max </sub>and K<sub>d </sub>of uptake of [<sup>3</sup>H] glycylsarcosine and transport of Gly-Val-ACV were determined using a non-linear least square regression analysis program (KALEIDAGRAPH V3.09). The quality of the fit was determined by evaluating the coefficient of determination (r<sup>2</sup>), the standard error of parameter estimates and by visual inspection of the residuals. </p> All the compounds of the invention inhibited the uptake of [<sup>3</sup>H] glycylsarcosine in a competitive manner, and the kinetics can be expressed according to Eq. 4  \nV=Vmax*CKm\u2061(1+I/Ki)+CEq.\u2003\u20624\n</p> In Eq. 4 I is the concentration of the ACV derivative and K<sub>i </sub>is the inhibitor concentration. Affinities (K<sub>i</sub>) for the various compounds were calculated by fitting the data to Eq. 4. The K<sub>i</sub>'s for the drugs were also calculated by transforming the Michaelis-Menten equation 4 to Lineweaver-Burk equation, which yields the linear Eq. 5 for competitive inhibition,  \n1V=Km*(1+IKi)Vmax*1C+1VmaxEq.\u2003\u20625\n</p> From a plot of 1/V vs. 1/C, V<sub>max </sub>and K<sub>m </sub>and hence K<sub>i </sub>can be estimated by linear regression analysis. </p> The affinity of Val-Val-ACV was also calculated from Dixon transformation of Eq. 4 which yields Eq. 6:  \n1V=Km*IVmax*Ki*C+1Vmax\u2062(1+KmC)Eq.\u2003\u20626\n</p> For Dose response studies in which Gly-Sar uptake was inhibited, the inhibitory effect of unlabeled Gly-Sar and Val-Val-ACV was described by the model illustrated by Eq. 7:  \nE=E0*IC\u2062\u2003\u206250nIC\u2062\u2003\u206250n+InEq.\u2003\u20627\n</p> The IC50 estimated from the Eq. 7 was used to calculate the K<sub>i </sub>of Gly-Sar and Val-Val-ACV by the method of Cheng and Prusoff (Cheng and Prusoff, 1973) in which K<sub>i </sub>is equivalent to IC50/(1+C/K<sub>m</sub>). The affinity of cephalexin, which was used as a positive control, was also evaluated in order to compare the K<sub>i</sub>'s of the dipeptide ACV derivatives. </p> Statistical Analysis: All experiments were conducted at least in triplicate and the results are expressed as mean\u00b1SD except in the case of Michaelis-Menten parameters K<sub>m</sub>, V<sub>max</sub>, K<sub>d </sub>and the affinities, K<sub>i </sub>where the values are presented as mean\u00b1S.E. Student's t-test was used to detect statistical significance between the affinities of the dipeptide ACV derivatives and Val-ACV and p&lt;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Statistical Significance was also tested by t-test between the affinities of the dipeptide ACV esters and cephalexin. Statistical comparisons between the affinities of various compounds were performed using the analysis of variance (SPSS for Windows Release 10.0.7. Chicago, Ill.). </p> Results </p> Time and concentration dependent uptake of [<sup>3</sup>H] Glycylsarcosine: The time course of Gly-Sar uptake (FIG. 4) was linear up to twenty minutes. As seen in the FIG. 4 inset the inhibition of [<sup>3</sup>H] Gly-Sar uptake was significant after 10 minutes. Based on these results 10 minute uptake was performed for all the experiments to maximize the radioactivity uptake and also to allow for a significant inhibition within the linear region of the uptake. FIG. 5 demonstrates the uptake of glycylsarcosine as a function",
    "e manner. </p> Lineweaver-Burk transformations of the uptake of Gly-Sar in presence of various ACV derivatives were of a competitive type revealing that the ACV derivatives shared a common enzyme site as that of Gly-Sar. Therefore it can be speculated that these ACV derivatives would be transported by the peptide transporter. The V<sub>max </sub>values of Gly-Sar in presence of all the ACV derivatives did not change as compared with control whereas the Km values were different (Table 8) confirming that the dipeptide ACV derivatives inhibited the uptake of Gly-Sar in a competitive manner.  \nTABLE 8Comparisons of Kinetic Parameters for Glycylsarcosine.Effect of Dipeptide ACV derivatives on the inhibitionof uptake of Glycylsarcosine.Glcylsarcosine ParametersV<sub>max</sub>(\u03bcmoles/min/mg)K<sub>m</sub>(mM)Gly-SarMichaelis-Menten0.078 \u00b1 0.0051.63 \u00b1 0.25Lineweaver-Burk0.086 \u00b1 0.0192.04 \u00b1 0.61 <sup>a</sup>Eadie-Hofstee0.071 \u00b1 0.0091.42 \u00b1 0.19Gly-Sar (with drugs) ParametersLineweaver-Burk+Val-ACV0.081 \u00b1 0.0914.7 \u00b1 1.32*+Gly-Val-ACV0.095 \u00b1 0.0713.2 \u00b1 1.97*+Val-Val-ACV0.099 \u00b1 0.1012.8 \u00b1 0.36*+Val-Tyr-ACV0.092 \u00b1 0.028.27 \u00b1 0.92*+Gly-Tyr-ACV0.094 \u00b1 0.117.21 \u00b1 2.61*+Tyr-Val-ACV0.091 \u00b1 0.077.01 \u00b1 0.91*+Tyr-Gly-ACV0.087 \u00b1 0.094.51 \u00b1 0.12*+Cephalexin0.101 \u00b1 0.034.08 \u00b1 0.36*Values are mean \u00b1 S.E.
