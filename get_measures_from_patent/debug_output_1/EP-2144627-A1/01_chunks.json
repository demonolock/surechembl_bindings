For example, for BALB/c mice a Kd binding malaria peptide (SYVPSAEQI); storage stock of lmg/ml in DMSO (kept at -20\u00b0C); prepare a working stock of 2 \u03bcg/ml.</p>2.2.3 Brefeldin A</p>Prepare Brefeldin A stock (Sigma # B-7651) of 10 mg/ml in DMSO; prepare working solution of 20 \u03bcg/ml in Click's RPMI/full medium (5 \u03bcg/ml final concentration in re- stimulation well).</p>Brefeldin A blocks the golgi transport thereby inhibiting secretion of produced cytokines, cytokines remain intracellular under Brefeldin A treatment so that cytokine producing cells can be detected using intracellular staining methods.</p>2.2.4 PMA / Ionomycin</p>PMA (Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate), Sigma # P8139; prepare stock of lmg/ml in DMSO; prepare working solution of 0.4 \u03bcg/ml in Click's RPMI/full medium (0.05 \u03bcg PMA/ml in re- stimulation well). \n\n Ionomycin, Sigma # 10634; prepare stock of lmg/ml in DMSO; prepare working solution of 4 \u03bcg/ml in Click's RPMI/full medium (0.5 \u03bcg PMA/ml in re-stimulation well).</p>PMA and ionomycin polyclonally stimulate T cells. It serves as a positive control in the assay to be sure that cell quality and intracellular staining procedures were optimal.</p>2.2.5 Click's RPMI/full medium</p>10.81 g powder Click's RPMI (+ L-Glutamine / - NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) from AppliChem # A2504.</p>+ 1.175 g NaHCO<sub>3</sub></p>Ad 1 1 with destilled water -&gt; sterile filtration</p>+ Glutamine 2 mM</p>+ PenStrep - 100 U/ml Penicillin, lOO\u03bcg/ml Streptomycin</p>+ 5% fetal calf serum (FCS), Invitrogen/Gibco # 10106-185,</p>+"
