{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n1. Currently, the most potent IDO inhibitor reported is 3-butyl-\u03b2-carboline (FIG. 1A), a non-competitive inhibitor with a Ki=3.3 \u03bcM (Peterson et al. (1993) Med. Chem. Res., 3:473-82).\n2. However, the most commonly used IDO inhibitor is 1-methyl-tryptophan (FIG. 1B), a commercially available compound that is a competitive inhibitor with a Ki=34 \u03bcM (Cady et al. (1991) Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 291:326-33).\n3. The natural product brassinin (1, FIG. 1C) was determined to be a moderately active competitive IDO inhibitor, Ki=97.7 \u03bcM."}
