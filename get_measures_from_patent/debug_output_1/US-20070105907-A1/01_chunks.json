Almost all previously known IDO inhibitors, whether competitive or non-competitive, possessed the indole ring of the natural substrate. Currently, the most potent IDO inhibitor reported is 3-butyl-\u03b2-carboline (FIG. 1A), a non-competitive inhibitor with a Ki=3.3 \u03bcM (Peterson et al. (1993) Med. Chem. Res., 3:473-82). However, the most commonly used IDO inhibitor is 1-methyl-tryptophan (FIG. 1B), a commercially available compound that is a competitive inhibitor with a Ki=34 \u03bcM (Cady et al. (1991) Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 291:326-33). </p> The natural product brassinin (1, FIG. 1C) was determined to be a moderately active competitive IDO inhibitor, Ki=97.7 \u03bcM. Brassinin is a phytoalexin in the cruciferous plants and has demonstrated some anti-fungal and anti-cancer activity (Pedras et al. (2000) Phytochemistry, 53:161-76; Pedras et al. (2005) J. Org. Chem., 70:1828-34; Pedras et al. (1998) Phytochemistry, 49:1959-65; Mehta et al. (1995) Carcinogenesis, 16:399-404). Accordingly, a structure-activity relationship study of brassinin was performed with the goal of obtaining a more potent IDO inhibitor. The brassinin structure was divided into four components: the indole core, the alkane linker, the dithiocarbamate moiety and the S-alkyl group (FIG. 1C). Analogs of brassinin that varied each of the four components were synthesized to determine the effect of each component on the activity of the resulting structure. Substantially more potent inhibitors of IDO were developed in accordance with the instant invention. </p> Three interpretations that can be made from the systematic study of the IDO inhibitory activity of brassinin reported herein are as follows. Contrary to most previously reported IDO inhibitors, an indole ring was not necessary for inhibitory activity with the dithiocarbamate analogs of brassinin. Although indole-containing derivatives were still the most active inhibitors (i.e., 13 and 16) analogs such as 5, 7, 8 and 9, had significant inhibitory activity and provide new opportunities for further inhibitor development. Importantly, new analogs might be possible that avoid the pharmacological issues of the indo"
