Specific biological activities of the proteins disclosed herein are described in detail above and in the Examples. Methods of detecting and measuring the biological activity of a protein of the invention include, but are not limited to, the assays described in the Examples section below. Such assays include, but are not limited to, measurement of enzyme activity {e.g., catalytic activity), measurement of substrate binding, and the like. It is noted that an isolated protein of the present invention (including homologues) is not required to have a biological activity such as catalytic activity. A protein can be a truncated, mutated or inactive protein, or lack at least one activity of the wild-type enzyme, for example. Inactive proteins may be useful in some screening assays, for example, or for other purposes such as antibody production.</p>Methods to measure protein expression levels of a protein according to the invention include, but are not limited to: western blotting, immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry or other immunologic-based assays; assays based on a property of the protein including but not limited to, ligand binding or interaction with other protein partners. Binding assays are also well known in the art. For example, a BIAcore machine can be used to determine the binding constant of a complex between two proteins. The dissociation constant for the complex can be determined by monitoring changes in the refractive index with respect to time as buffer is passed over the chip (O'Shannessy et al. Anal. Biochem. 212:457-468 (1993); Schuster et al., Nature 365:343-347 (1993)). Other suitable assays for measuring the binding of one protein to another include, for example, \n\n immunoassays such as enzyme linked immunoabsorbent assays (ELISA) and radioimmunoassays (RIA), or determination of binding by monitoring the change in the spectroscopic or optical properties of the proteins through fluorescence, UV absorption, circular dichrosim, or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Many of the enzymes and proteins of the present invention may be desirable targets for modification and use in the processes described herein. These proteins have been described in terms of function and amino acid sequence (and nucleic acid sequence encoding the same) of representative wild-type proteins. In one embodiment of the invention, homologues of a given protein (which can include related proteins from other organisms or modified forms of the given protein) are encompassed for use in the invention. Homologues of a protein encompassed by the present invention can comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of, in one embodiment, an amino acid sequence that is at least about 35% identical, and more preferably at least about 40% identical, and more preferably at least about 45% identical, and more preferably at least about 50",
    "quences allowing for the introduction of gaps (deletions and insertions) in the resulting alignment. For purposes of clarity herein, a BLAST 2 sequence alignment is performed using the standard default parameters as follows. For blastn, using 0 BLOSUM62 matrix: \n\n Reward for match = 1 Penalty for mismatch = -2 Open gap (5) and extension gap (2) penalties gap x dropoff (50) expect (10) word size (11) filter (on) For blastp, using 0 BLOSUM62 matrix:</p>Open gap (11) and extension gap (1) penalties gap x dropoff (50) expect (10) word size (3) filter (on).</p>A protein of the present invention can also include proteins having an amino acid sequence comprising at least 10 contiguous amino acid residues of any of the sequences described herein (i.e., 10 contiguous amino acid residues having 100% identity with 10 contiguous amino acids of SEQ ID NO:2). In other embodiments, a homologue of a protein amino acid sequence includes amino acid sequences comprising at least 20, or at least 30, or at least 40, or at least 50, or at least 75, or at least 100, or at least 125, or at least 150, or at least 175, or at least 150, or at least 200, or at least 250, or at least 300, or at least 350 contiguous amino acid residues of any of the amino acid sequence represented disclosed herein. Even small fragments of proteins without biological activity are useful in the present invention, for example, in the preparation of antibodies against the full- length protein or in a screening assay (e.g., a binding assay). Fragments can also be used to construct fusion proteins, for example, where the fusion protein comprises functional domains from two or more different proteins (e.g., a CBM from one protein linked to a CD from another protein). In one embodiment, a homologue has a measurable or detectable biological activity associated with the wild-type protein (e.g., enzymatic activity).</p>According to the present invention, the term \"contiguous\" or \"consecutive\", with regard to nucleic acid or amino acid sequences described herein, means to be connected in an unbroken sequence. For example, for a first sequence to comprise 30 contiguous (or consecutive) amino acids of a second sequence, means that the first sequence includes an unbroken sequence of 30 amino acid residues that is 100% identical to an unbroken sequence of 30 amino acid residues in the second sequence. Similarly, for a first sequence to have \"100% identity\" with a second sequence means that the first sequence exactly matches the second sequence with no gaps between nucleotides or amino acids.</p>In another embodiment, a protein of the present invention, including a homologue, includes a protein having an amino acid sequence that is sufficiently similar to a natural \n\n amino acid sequence that a nucleic acid sequence encoding the homologue is capable of hybridizing under moderate, high or very high stringency conditions (described below) to (i.e., with) a nucleic acid molecule encoding the natural protein (i.e"
