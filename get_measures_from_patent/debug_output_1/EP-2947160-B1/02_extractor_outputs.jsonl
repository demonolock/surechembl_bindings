{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that meet the specified criteria, as the text does not contain specific molecule names, bioactivity metrics, numeric values, and units together in the same sentence. The text appears to be focused on describing methods and calculations for determining the likelihood of response to chemotherapy, rather than reporting specific bioactivity data."}
{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that meet the specified criteria. The text does not contain specific molecule names, bioactivity metrics, numeric values, and units as required. The text appears to describe a method for determining a recurrence score (RS) or response to therapy (RTS) score based on gene expression levels, but it does not provide specific data that meets the criteria."}
{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that contain all four required components: a specific molecule name, ID or other identifier, a bioactivity metric, a specific numeric value for that metric, and a unit for that value. The text appears to be related to gene expression and cancer treatment, but it does not provide specific bioactivity metrics with numeric values and units."}
{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that contain all four required components: a specific molecule name, ID or other identifier, a bioactivity metric, a specific numeric value for that metric, and a unit for that value. The text appears to be a patent application related to gene expression markers for predicting response to chemotherapy, but it does not include specific bioactivity data."}
