However, graft-versus-host disease can occur even when HLA-identical siblings are the donors. Classically, acute graft-versus-host-disease is characterized by selective damage to the liver, skin and mucosa, and the gastrointestinal tract. Additional studies show that that graft-versus-host-disease targets organs including the immune system (such as the bone marrow and the thymus) itself, and the lungs in the form of idiopathic pneumonitis. Chronic graft-versus-host-disease also attacks the above organs, but over its long-term course can also cause damage to the connective tissue and exocrine glands.</p>\u201cHeterologous,\u201d as used herein, refers broadly to portions of a nucleic acid indicates that the nucleic acid comprises two or more subsequences that are not found in the same relationship to each other in nature.

In an exemplary ELISA, microtiter plates are coated with a purified antigen, herein VISTA at 0.25 \u03bcg/ml in PBS, and then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS.

Testing of Vista Agonist Antibodies According to the Invention in Concanavalin A-Induced Hepatitis Animal Model.Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the liver, characterized by the loss of self-tolerance leading to B and T cell responses against the liver. The ConA model represents the best-characterized system for understanding the pathogenesis of AIH. ConA is a lectin that binds to specific sugar moieties, which are enriched in the liver. The modification of these sugar residues by ConA results in rapid CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation through interaction with modified MHC structures expressed by liver macrophages. An intense, but transient, cytokine production occurs with most canonical T cell cytokines (IL-2, IL-3, IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1) reaching peak plasma levels within 4-6 hours. Notably, ConA induced inflammation can be blocked by depleting CD4+ T cells. The ConA model with hV-KI mice may be used to confirm suppressive activity of agonistic anti-VISTA mAbs according to the invention. Mice are weighed and treated with 10 mpk of anti-VISTA antibody or the appropriate isotype control 3 hours prior to injection with 15 mpk of ConA. The anti-VISTA mAbs are administered I.P. while ConA is injected via the tail-vein in these mice. At the 6-hour time-point post ConA administration, the mice are euthanized and blood is collected. The plasma fraction is then be analyzed for plasma cytokines by a multiplex assay for 32 cytokines. Each antibody is tested two times in independent experiments to confirm activity. For each cytokine in the 32-plex, a one-way ANOVA will be performed, with a Dunnett's post-test to compare each anti-VISTA antibody to the isotype control. The tested anti-VISTA mAb is ranked based upon efficacy of cytokine suppression (how much was the cytokine suppressed) and variability (how consistent is the suppression within each experiment and between experiments). Additional emphasis is placed on mAb that suppress cytokines that are canonically associated with T cell activation.</p>Numerous anti-human VISTA antibodies according to the invention have been screened in the ConA model and were efficacious (immunosuppressive) therein, i.e., they suppressed ConA-induced cytokine production and promoted survival and in particular suppressed the expression of cytokines involved in T cell activation including IL-2. Particularly, the inventors tested INX8",

Testing of Vista Agonist Antibodies According to the Invention in Graft Versus Host Disease Animal ModelsGVHD is a systemic disease mediated by adoptive transfer of allogeneic T cells into an irradiated host. There are five major steps that are critical in the pathogenesis of GVHD; 1) Damage to the host, most commonly in the form of the irradiation event that precedes the T cell transfer; 2) Activation of the allogeneic T cells by both host and donor APCs; 3) Expansion of the T cells in the lymph nodes and spleen; 4) Trafficking into peripheral sites such as the skin, gut, liver and lung; and 5) Damage to the host driven by T cells and also recruited myeloid cells. In certain models, such as F1\u2192Parental strain, a chronic GVHD occurs that is a suitable model for lupus as the mice develop anti-nuclear mAb and immune complex mediated glomerular nephritis. Of note, genetic deletion of VISTA from the donor T cells results in a more aggressive form of GHVD than seen in mice receiving WT T cells.</p>This assay may be used to identify and rank agonism of agonistic anti-human VISTA candidates. Also this assay may be used to confirm that agonist antibodies according to the invention may be used to treat or prevent GVHD. In this model BALB/c mice are lethally irradiated and given allogeneic bone marrow and splenic T cells from hV-KI mice to induce GVHD; with one group not receiving T cells as a negative control. Mice receiving the allogeneic T cells are split into the control Ig group and the treatment groups. Up to four unique VISTA mAb will be used in a single experiment, with eight mice per group, and two replicate experiments will be conducted. 10 mpk or another dose of antibody is administered at the time of T cell transfer, as well as at days 2 and 4 post transfer. The body weight of each mouse will be tracked, and any mouse that loses more than 20% of its initial starting bodyweight will be sacrificed. Kaplan Meier curves are generated for each experiment with a log-rank statistical test comparing each anti-VISTA antibody to the control. Should all four VISTA mAb fully protect against GVHD, then dose response assays will be run in the GVHD model with groups being treated with 10, 3, 1 and 0.3 mpk of antibody. LD50 values will be calculated for each antibody.</p>A number of agonist anti-human VISTA antibodies according to the invention were evaluated in this animal model. These tested antibodies all were efficacious (immunosuppressive) in this model, i.e., they reduced the symptoms of the disease, slowed disease progression, reduced disease-associated weight loss and promoted survival. Particularly, each of INX800, INX801, INX901, INX902, INX903 and INX904 were evaluated and were demonstrated to alleviated or prevent disease symptoms in this animal model. Also, it was determined using the A and ",
    "ning for Agonistic Anti-Human VISTA AbsThe previous examples relate to the isolation and characterization of agonistic anti-mouse VISTA Abs. Heretofore an agonistic anti-human VISTA Ab has never been reported in the literature. This is despite the fact that very many antagonistic anti-human VISTA antibodies have been identified by the present Assignee and other groups. Accordingly, prior to this invention it was uncertain whether agonistic anti-human VISTA antibodies would be identified.</p>Such antibodies would be highly beneficial as currently there is no approved human therapeutics that exploit the natural function of NCR's to suppress the immune response. Although Orencia (CTLA4-Ig) is effective, it only acts by blocking the CD28-B7 interaction and pathway and does not work by stimulating a downregulatory pathway. As illustrated by the potent immunosuppressive effects of 2 different agonistic anti-VISTA mAbs as shown in the examples which follow, the engagement of this pathway may prove to be a revolution in the management of different human autoimmune diseases. Moreover, the immunosuppressive impact of anti-VISTA on both adaptive and innate autoimmune effector mechanisms sets it apart from many other anti-inflammatory agents.</p>With respect to the foregoing, it was hypothesized that a desirable and necessary reagent in screening for agonistic anti-human VISTA Abs is a human VISTA knock-in mouse. A human VISTA knock-in mouse has been created by the present Assignee (\u201chV-KI Mouse\u201d). These hV-KI mice express human VISTA in replacement of mouse VISTA. Particularly, as shown in FIG. 3 CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, Tregs (CD4<sup>+</sup> FoxP3<sup>+</sup>), and monocytes, CD11b<sup>+</sup>, Ly6C<sup>+</sup>, Ly6G<sup>\u2212</sup> were isolated from the lymph nodes of WT and VISTA KI mice, and stained with \u03b1VISTA antibodies against mouse or human protein respectively. The expression pattern of the hV-KI is identical to what is seen in WT mice as CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, regulatory T cells and monocytes all express consistent amounts of surface protein between the two strains (see FIG. 3).</p>Additionally, hV-KI mice do not develop any signs of inflammatory disease that are observed in VISTA KO mice, indicating that hVISTA is fully functional within the mouse immune system (data not shown). Accordingly, this mouse model may be used in different assays to screen for immunosuppressive mAbs.</p>Example 4: Synthesis of Putative Agonistic Anti-Human VISTA AntibodiesThe sequences of different anti-human VISTA antibodies is contained in FIG. 4. These antibodies specifically bind to human VISTA, e.g., VSTB49-VSTB116, and possess VISTA antagonist properties, i.e., these antibodies inhibit the suppressive effects of VISTA on immunity when in the IgG1 format, e.g., when the antibody comprises an IgG1 Fc region which is wild-type, i.e., unmodified.</p>Among the antibodies identified in FIG. 4 is 1E8. This murine anti-human VISTA antibody comprises the variable heavy and light chain polypeptides set forth below and was converted by the inventors into two human chimeric forms. The first chimeric antibody referred to herein as INX800 was obtained by the attachment of human IgG2 heavy and light constant region polypeptides to the 1E8 variable heavy and light chain polypeptides.

Disease severity is measured by following weight loss. FIG. 56A-D illustrates the mean (FIG. 56A and FIG. 56C) weight loss and survival (b and d) for INX901 (FIG. 56C and FIG. 56D) and INX903 (FIG. 56A and FIG. 56B) treated mice during the course of the experiment.</p>INX903 attenuates disease severity at all doses tested as assessed by the reduced weight loss compared to Control Ig treated mice (FIG. 56A). INX903 also increases survival at all dose tested with the lowest dose of 1 mg/kg appearing more protective than higher doses (FIG. 56B).</p>INX901 completely inhibits disease at all doses tested as assessed by the absence of weight loss compared to Control Ig treated mice (FIG. 56C). INX901 also increases survival at all doses tested with the lowest dose of 1 mg/kg appearing more protective than higher doses (FIG. 56D).</p>After 27 to 34 days, peripheral blood is harvested from surviving mice and tested for chimerism (donor derived hematopoietic system) by staining for donor (H2Kb) or recipient (H2Kd) MHC class I.</p>FIG. 57A illustrates the percentage of chimerism in INX903 treated mice and FIG. 57B the percentage of chimerism in INX901 treated mice. All mice that received bone marrow cells only and nearly all mice that received T cells and were treated with INX901 failed to reach chimerism due to \u201cfailure of engraftment\u201d (FIG. 57A and FIG. 57B). This phenomenon could be explained by a suboptimal irradiation dose and the high potency of INX901 to suppress T cell activation. As noted above it is well established that T cells help engraftment especially at low doses of TBI. As evidence thereof, complete chimerism was achieved in almost all the mice that received T cells and were treated with the less suppressive INX903 (FIG. 57A).</p>Therefore, INX901 and INX903 respectively suppress or attenuate acute GvHD at doses as low as 1 mg/kg. Lower doses appear more effective than higher doses although mortality could also be due to engraftment failure in mice receiving strong immune suppressive antibodies in the context of low doses of TBI. These results provide further evidence that VISTA agonist antibodies may be used to treat and prevent GvHD disease.</p>Example 32: Compared Efficacy of \u03b1-Human VISTA Antibodies INX803, INX804 at 10 mg/Kg on GvHD in Irradiated BALB/c Mice Injected with DDE1 T Cells and Bone MarrowIn these experiments we used fully C57/Bl6 Human-VISTA Knock in mice (DDE1) as donor for T cells and bone marrow transferred in irradiated BALB/c recipient.

INX803 (Green) is strongly suppressive, inhibits disease development and fully protects the mice. INX804 attenuates disease severity at the peak of disease but fails to provide complete protection to the mice long term, half of which eventually succumb to GvHD. Therefore, the tested \u03b1-human VISTA antibodies showed immune-suppressive activity in their ability to attenuate or completely suppress acute GvHD. These results provide further evidence that anti-human VISTA agonist antibodies may be used to treat and prevent GvHD disease.</p>Example 33: Efficacy of \u03b1-Human VISTA Antibodies INX800 and INX801 on GvHD in Irradiated BALB/c Mice Injected with DDE1 T Cells and Bone MarrowIn these experiments we again used fully C57/Bl6 Human-VISTA Knock in mice (DDE1) as donor for T cells and bone marrow transferred in irradiated BALB/c recipient.

In fact, while all mice from the control group had to be sacrificed within 2 weeks, all of the mice treated with INX800 or INX801 survived for &gt;32 days (FIG. 59). In the experiment acute GvHD was induced by transfer of T cells and BM from hV-KI mice into irradiated Balb/c recipients. Mice were tracked for disease by weight loss, with mice being sacrificed if more than 20% of the initial starting weight was lost.</p>Therefore, both INX800 and INX801 attenuate acute GvHD at a dose of 10 mg/kg. These mice suffered less weight loss and showed increased survival over the Ig control group. These results provide further evidence that anti-human VISTA agonist antibodies may be used to treat and prevent GvHD disease, both acute and chronic forms.</p>Example 34: Effects of Anti-Murine Vista Antibodies in NZBWF-1 Lupus ModelNZBWF-1 Lupus ModelNew Zealand black x New Zealand white (NZBWF-1) is a commercially available lupus prone strain available through The Jackson Laboratory.

It is accepted in the art that two-week phenotypes reliably predict the long-term clinical phenotypes and can serve as early surrogate markers for long-term disease (\u201cAdvances in lupus stemming from the parent-into-F1 model\u201d. Via CS. Trends Immunol., 2010 Jun. 31(6):236-45).</p>Materials and MethodsStudy Design</p>A schematic summarizing the experimental parameters is contained in FIG. 67. As shown therein INX903 (anti-human IgG2 agonist antibody containing variable regions of VSTB95 antibody) was administered at days 0, 2, and 6 following DDE1 transfer. At each time point, 4 mice per group were analyzed plus 1 na\u00efve mouse. Spleens were processed for flow cytometry, and serum was recovered from cardiac blood for detection of anti-dsDNA IgG by ELISA.</p>Mice</p>Human VISTA KI (DDE1) mice have the human VISTA cDNA knocked-in in place of the mouse VISTA gene, and express only human VISTA both at RNA and protein level. The mice are bred at Sage Labs (Boyertown, Pa.). The mice, aged 8-12 weeks, first transited for 3 weeks in the quarantine facility, and then were transferred to our regular facility. 4-month old female DDE1 mice were used. 9 weeks old female B6D2F1 mice were purchased from the Jackson Lab.</p>Spleen Cell Isolation and Transfer</p>The equivalent of 1 DDE1 donor spleen was transferred per B6D2F1 mouse recipient.</p>Single cell suspensions were prepared from 36 DDE1 spleens by mechanical disruption. RBCs were lysed with ACK.</p>CD8 T cells were depleted using Dynabeads\u00ae Mouse CD8 (Lyt 2) (Thermofisher #11447D) according to manufacturer instruction.</p>To follow cell proliferation, spleen cells were stained with Cell Trace Violet (Cell Trace\u2122 Violet Cell Proliferation Kit, for flow cytometry (Thermofisher # C34557) according to manufacturer instruction.</p>A total of 1,230\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>CD8 depleted spleen cells was obtained.</p>Each B6D2F1 mouse received 34\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>CD8 depleted spleen cells in a volume of 204.1 per tail vein injection (iv).</p>Anti-Human VISTA Antibodies and Dosage</p>INX903 was dosed at 10 mg/kg.</p>At day 0, antibodies were directly added to the cell suspension just prior IV transfer into recipient B6D2F1 mice.</p>Mice were then dosed on day 2 and 6 via intraperitoneal (ip) injections.</p>Control group receiv"
