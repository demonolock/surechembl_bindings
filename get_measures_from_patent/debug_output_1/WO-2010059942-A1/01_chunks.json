Small molecule agents</p>[0044] In some embodiments, an agent that inhibits AECE proteolytic activity is a small molecule agent. For example, in some embodiments, an agent that inhibits CIpP proteolytic activity is a small molecule agent. Small molecule inhibitors include, e.g., compounds that are less than about 25 kDa, e.g., compounds that are from about 50 daltons to about 25 kDa, e.g., from about 50 daltons to about 100 daltons, from about 100 daltons to about 500 daltons, from about 500 daltons to about 1 kilodaltons (kDa), from about 1 kDa to about 5 kDa, from about 5 kDa to about 10 kDa, or from about 10 kDa to about 25 kDa. Small molecule inhibitors can have a molecular weight in a range of from about 50 daltons to about 3000 daltons, e.g., from about 50 daltons to about 75 daltons, from about 75 daltons to about 100 daltons, from about 100 daltons to about 250 daltons, from about 250 daltons to about 500 daltons, from about 500 daltons to about 750 daltons, from about 750 daltons to about 1000 daltons, from about 1000 daltons to about 1250 daltons, from about 1250 daltons to about 1500 daltons, from about 1500 daltons to about 2000 daltons, from about 2000 daltons to about 2500 daltons, or from about 2500 daltons to about 3000 daltons.</p>[0045] A small molecule CIpP inhibitor can have an IC<sub>50</sub> (half maximal effective concentration) is from about 1 pM to about 1 mM, e.g., from about 1 pM to about 10 pM, from about 10 pM to about 25 pM, from about 25 pM to about 50 pM, from about 50 pM to about 100 pM, from about 100 pM to about 250 pM, from about 250 pM to about 500 pM, from about 500 pM to about 750 pM, from about 750 pM to about 1 nM, from about 1 nM to about 10 nM, from about 10 nM to about 15 nM, from about 15 nM to about 25 nM, from about 25 nM to about 50 nM, from about 50 nM to about 75 nM, from about 75 nM to about 100 nM, from about 100 nM to about 150 nM, from about 150 nM to about 200 nM, from about 200 nM to about 250 nM, from about 250 nM to about 300 nM, from about 300 nM to about 350 nM, from about 350 nM to about 400 nM, from about 400 nM to about 450 nM, from about 450 nM to about 500 nM, from about 500 nM to about 750 nM, from about 750 nM to about 1 \u03bcM, from about 1 \u03bcM to about 10 \u03bcM, from about 10 \u03bcM to about 25 \u03bcM, from about 25 \u03bcM to about 50 \u03bcM, \n\n from about 50 \u03bcM to about 75 \u03bcM, from about 75 \u03bcM to about 100 \u03bcM, from about 100 \u03bcM to about 250 \u03bcM, from about 250 \u03bcM to about 500 \u03bcM, or from about 500 \u03bcM to about 1 mM.</p>[0046] In some embodiments, a small molecule CIpP inhibitor is selective for CIpP, e.g., the small molecule inhibitor inhibits an enzyme other than CIpP, if at all, by less than about 20%, less than about 15%, less than about 10%, or less than about 5%, at a concentration that would cause at least a 50% inhibition of CIpP activ"
