{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nBicycles labelled with fluorescein (tracers) were screened in a fluorescence polarisation direct binding assay to determine affinity (K<sub>d</sub>) forwild-type (WT) S1 domain (ACROBiosystems, S1N-C82E8) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein. \n\n\nNote that the tables mentioned in the text (Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4) are not included as they are in image format and not in text format. However, the sentence above mentions the Kd value for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein, but it does not provide a specific numeric value. \n\nIf you need more information, please let me know. I can try to help you further."}
