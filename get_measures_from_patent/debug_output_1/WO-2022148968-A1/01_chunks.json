    "de was diluted with 50:50 MeCNLFhO up to ~35 ml_, -500 pl_ of 100 mM scaffold in acetonitrile was added, and the reaction was initiated with 5 ml_ of 1 M NH4HCO3 in H2O. The reaction was allowed to proceed for -30 -60 min at RT, and lyophilised once the reaction had completed (judged by MALDI). Once completed, 1ml of 1M L-cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate (Sigma) in H2O was added to the reaction for -60 min at RT to quench any excess TATA, TATB or TCMT. </p>Following lyophilisation, the modified peptide was purified as above, while replacing the Luna C8 with a Gemini C18 column (Phenomenex), and changing the acid to 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Pure fractions containing the correct scaffold-modified material were pooled, lyophilised and kept at -20\u00b0C for storage. </p>All amino acids, unless noted otherwise, were used in the L- configurations. </p>In some cases peptides are converted to activated disulfides prior to coupling with the free thiol group of a toxin using the following method; a solution of 4-methyl(succinimidyl 4-(2- pyridylthio)pentanoate) (100mM) in dry DMSO (1.25 mol equiv) was added to a solution of peptide (20mM) in dry DMSO (1 mol equiv). The reaction was well mixed and DIPEA (20 mol equiv) was added. The reaction was monitored by LC/MS until complete. </p>BIOLOGICAL DATA </p>Example 1 : Affinity determination by fluorescence polarization (FP) direct binding. </p>Bicycles labelled with fluorescein (tracers) were screened in a fluorescence polarisation direct binding assay to determine affinity (K<sub>d</sub>) forwild-type (WT) S1 domain (ACROBiosystems, S1N-C82E8) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein. Tracers were added at 1 nM final to a titration of individual SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein variants in assay buffer (PBS + 0.01 % Tween20, pH7.4) to a maximum of 2.54mM. Fluorescence was measured at 485/520/520 on a BMG PHERAstar FSX plate reader. Where appropriate, SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein variants alone parallel and perpendicular intensities were subtracted before mP was calculated. Subsequently, mP data was fit to non-linear regression analysis in Dotmatics to generate a K<sub>d</sub> value. Where no significant assay window was generated, data was reported to show no binding at maximum concentration of protein. Where a K<sub>d</sub> was generated above the top concentration of protein tested, the result was flagged as K<sub>d</sub> greater \n\n than maximum concentration of protein tested - results associated with this flag may be displayed as K<sub>d</sub> &gt; x mM. </p>Selected bicyclic peptides of the invention were tested in the above mentioned direct binding assay and the results are shown in Table 1: </p>Table 1 : Direct Binding Assay Results for Selected Bicyclic Peptides of the</p>Invention \n<img id=\"imgf000060_0001\" path=\"imgf000060_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/962805660/WO/20220714/A1/002022/14/89/68/imgf000060_0001.tif\"/>\n \n\n\n<img id=\"imgf000061_0002\" path=\"imgf000061_0002.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/962805664/WO/20220714/A1/002022/14/89/68/imgf000061_0002.tif\"/>\n </p>Example 2: Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Assay </p>Selected bicyclic peptides of the invention were tested in an SPR assay in accordance with standard procedures known to those skilled in the art and the results are shown in Table 2: </p>Table 2: SPR Assay Results for Selected Bicyclic Peptides of the Invention \n<img id=\"imgf000061_0001\" path=\"imgf000061_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/962805662/WO/20220714/A1/002022/14/89/68/imgf000061_0001.tif\"/>\n </p>Example 3: Affinity determination by fluorescence polarization (FP) direct binding using mutated variants of Spike Protein </p>This experiment was conducted in the same manner as described in Example 1 to assess binding of selected bicyclic peptides of the invention against a selection of mutated variants \n\n of the isolated S1, S1-NTD and S1-RBD domains of spike protein.
