The activity of compounds of this invention as central muscarinic binding site agonists and antagonists was measured. In the RQNB screening assay, which is described more fully by Mark Watson, et al, J. Pharmacol. and Exp. Ther., 237(2):411 (1986), rat cerebral cortex tissue was treated with radiolabeled quinuclidinyl benzilate, a known muscarinic binding site antagonist. The concentrations of test compound required to inhibit of the binding of this muscarinic antagonist were then determined.</p>Similarly, in the RCMD screening assay, described more fully by T. W. rickroy, et al, 229(3):747 (1984), rat. cerebral cortex tissue was treated with radiolabeled cis-methyldioxolane, a known muscarinic binding site agonist. The concentrations of test compounds required to inhibit 50% of the binding of this muscarinic agonist were then determined. These values are reported as IC50 concentrations in Table 2 and demonstrate that the compounds of the present invention possess significant muscarinic activity.</p>              TABLE 4                                                     \n______________________________________                                    \n                IC.sub.50  nM                                             \n                         IC.sub.50  nM                                    \nExample No.     RCMD     RQNB                                             \n______________________________________                                    \n 3              18.2     24558                                            \n 2              12.5     3112                                             \n 4              3.5      3519                                             \n 5              133      5947                                             \n 6              120      3846                                             \n 7              46       2030                                             \n 8              53       4775                                             \n 48             116      8820                                             \n49 (Isomer A)   12.9     434                                              \n49 (Isomer B)   256      9650                                             \n 77             8        958                                              \n 78             25       4680                                             \n 79            ",
