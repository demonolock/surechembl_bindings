Miralpeix, M. Camacho et al., Brit. J. Pharmacol. 121 (1997), 171-180), were seeded onto 96-well plates (RPMI 1640 + 10 % FCS) and treated with 100 nM (nmol/l) phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 6 h at 37\u00b0C to induce COX-2 isoenzyme. 50 \u00b5M (\u00b5mol/l) arachidonic acid were then added and the cells were incubated in the presence of test compounds or mixtures for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. Prostaglandine-E2 production was measured by radioimmuno assay (RIA) and the radioactivity determined with a scintillation counter (Topcount, Packard) using a liquid scintillation cocktail (Packard).</p>The results obtained are expressed as a percent of control values and as a percent inhibition of control values obtained in the presence of the test compounds. The control values are obtained by performing the above-indicated steps, wherein however instead ... (seems to be missing still - please indicate).</p>The concentration causing a half-maximal inhibition of control values (IC50 value) and Hill coefficients (nH) were determined for the reference compounds (cycloheximide) by nonlinear regression analysis of their inhibition curves. These parameters were obtained by Hill equation curve fitting. The IC50 values obtained for the reference compounds were within accepted limits of historic averages obtained \u00b1 0.5 log units.</p>All COX-2 screening experiments were conducted once. In the following, inhibition values below 10% were not considered and have been indicated as \"0\".</p>2.2. COX-2 screening of Human milk fractionSkimmed human milk shows a significant COX-2 inhibition (25%; Table 2). When casein is removed by acidification or rennet (yielding acid whey and sweet whey, respectively), values of 51% and 58% COX-2 inhibition were achieved. Thus, removing casein greatly improves COX-2 inhibition. In addition, the caseins alone (acid, sweet, micellar) do not show any inhibitory effect on COX-2.</p>Soluble whey from human milk performed just like the starting product (i.e., skimmed human milk).\nTable 2Results from COX-2 screening with human milk fractions.

In contrast to human milk, the acid removal of caseins leads to a loss of two thirds of its activity (down to 12%), probably due to an acid-induced loss of activity after acidification."
