    " enzyme, peptide substrate and serially diluted test compounds were pre-incubated together in assay buffer (5 \u03bcL) for 15 minutes (peptide substrate concentration: 50 nM; JAK enzyme concentrations: 2 nM JAK1; 30 \u03bcM JAK2; 80 \u03bcM JAK3 and 4 nM TYK2). And the assay was initiated by the addition of 5 \u03bcL assay buffer containing 2\u00d7 final ATP concentration (these are the 2\u00d7ATP concentrations: 76 \u03bcM JAK1; 24 \u03bcM JAK2; 8 \u03bcM JAK3 and 30 \u03bcM TYK2). Following the 90-minute incubation, antibody conjugated with Eu is dissolved in detection buffer to add into wells and then incubated for 60 minutes. The 10 \u03bcL detection buffer contains EDTA to stop the enzymatic reaction. The plate is analyzed by Perkin Elmer Envision on TR-FRET mode. The high ratio of 665/615 represents no inhibition of kinase reaction while the low ratio of 665/615 represents complete inhibition of kinase reaction.</p>Curves are fit by XLFIT5 as inhibition rate % vs. log [compound concentration] using 4 parameters logistic model 205.</p>The IC<sub>50 </sub>for each compound tested was determined and is summarized in Table 2 below. In the table, \u201cA\u201d indicates an IC<sub>50 </sub>of less than 100 nM, \u201cB\u201d indicates an IC<sub>50 </sub>range from 100 nM to 500 nM; \u201cC\u201d indicates an IC<sub>50 </sub>range from 500 nM to 2 \u03bcM; and \u201cD\u201d indicates an IC<sub>50 </sub>greater than 2 \u03bcM.

Cells were maintained in log phase before the assay. Cell pellets were collected and resuspended in serum-free and phenol-free RPMI 1640 medium. 40,000 cells/well (10 \u03bcL) were seeded in each well of a 384-well plate and incubated with and without compound for 2 hours at 37\u00b0 C. and 5% C02. IL-2 was added (2 \u03bcL, final concentration 100 ng/mL) and the mixture was incubated for 10 min. Cells were lysed by adding 4 \u03bcL labeled antibodies and the mixture was incubated overnight. The plate was read using the HTRF protocol on an Envision plate reader. The data was analyzed using XL-fit software (Supplier: ID business solutions Ltd.; Software version: XL fit 5.0). Inhibition %=(Max\u2212Sample value)/(Max\u2212Min)*100.</p>The IC<sub>50 </sub>for each compound tested was determined and is summarized in Table 3 below. In the table, \u201cA\u201d indicates an IC<sub>50 </sub>of less than 0.5 \u03bcM, \u201cB\u201d indicates an IC<sub>50 </sub>range from 0.5 \u03bcM to 1 \u03bcM; and \u201cC\u201d indicates an IC<sub>50 </sub>range from 1 \u03bcM to 10 \u03bcM.
