    "e moiety is a vitamin, such as vitamin B12 or vitamin D, and is conjugated to the side chain of a D-amino acid. Vitamins have been shown to improve the oral bioavailability of GnRH peptides (Russell-Jones et al., 1995, Bioconjug. Chem., 6:34-42; Russell-Jones et al., 1995, Bioconjug. Chem., 6:459-465).</p>Preferably, the ability of the agent of the invention to bind to and activate the GnRH receptor is not affected and/or significantly affected by the one or more moiety.</p>Several factors determine the antiproliferative activity of the agents of the invention, including the affinity of the agent for the GnRH receptor and the coupling of the receptor to the intracellular machinery involved in the parturition signalling pathway. Thus, the antiproliferative activity of the agents of the invention is not determined solely by its affinity for the GnRH receptor\u2014for example, two agents of the invention may display different antiproliferative activities but have identical affinities for the GnRH receptor.</p>The GnRH receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that possesses seven-transmembrane domains (7\u2122). Cloning and characterisation of such receptors are described, for example, in Tsutsumi et al. (1992, Mol. Endocrinol., 6:1163-1169) and Kakar et al. (1992, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm., 189:289-295) and Chi et al. (1993, Mol. Cell. Endocrinol., 91:R1-6).</p>Methods for determining the binding of a GnRH peptide (or analogue thereof) to the GnRH receptor include a competitive binding assay as described in Tsutsumi et al. (1992, Mol. Endocrinol., 6:1163-1169) and Kakar et al. (1992, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm., 189:289-295) and Chi et al. (1993, Mol. Cell. Endocrinol., 91:R1-6). Briefly, in that method, the peptide or analogue of interest is labelled with I<sup>125 </sup>and binding determined in the presence of an unlabelled peptide in whole cells expressing the GnRH receptor or membranes comprising the GnRH receptor.</p>In a second aspect, the invention provides an agent comprising the peptide sequence:</p>pGlu-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr/His-Gly-Leu/Trp-R4-Pro-Awherein: R4 is any amino acid except arginineand A is selected from the group consisting of:Z; orazaGly; orazaGly.Z; orDAla.Z; orGlu.Z; orDAla-Glu.Z; orDAla-DAla.Z; or\u03b2Ala.Z; orPro; orPro.Z; orDAla-Gly.Z; andGly.Z,wherein Z is a group which removes the charge on the C-terminal amino acid residue\n\nfor use in medicine.\n</p>Preferably, Z has a molecular weight of less than 200, preferably less than 150, preferably less than 100. Preferably, Z is NHR' wherein R\u2032 is H or C<sub>1 </sub>to C<sub>4 </sub>alkyl or Z is OR\u2033 wherein R\u2033 is C<sub>1 </sub>to C<sub>4 </sub>alkyl. Preferably, Z is an amide. Preferably, Z is NH<sub>2 </sub>or N-propylamide or N-ethylamide (NHEt) or N-methylamide or N-butylamide.</p>By Tyr/His we include that either the amino acid Tyrosine (Tyr) or the amino acid Histidine (His) is present at position 5 of the peptide sequence.</p>By Leu/Trp we include that either the amino acid Leuc"
