    "ransfected with a DNA molecule coding for the homogeneous antibody, a prokaryotic host cell transfected with a DNA molecule coding for the homogeneous antibody, etc.) and is generally characterized by heavy chains of one and only one class and subclass, and light chains of only one type. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific and are directed against a single antigen. In addition, in contrast with preparations of polyclonal antibodies which typically include various antibodies directed against various determinants, or epitopes, each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single epitope of the antigen.</p>The term \u201cantigen\u201d herein means any substance that causes the immune system to produce antibodies against the said substance. An \u201cimmunogenic\u201d antigen is a specific type of antigen which is able to stimulate an adaptive immune response if injected on its own. At the molecular level, an antigen is thus characterized by its ability to be \u201cbound\u201d to the antigen-binding site of an antibody.</p>In the context of the present invention, the antigens used in the methods of the invention are C. difficile antigens. Preferably, they are C. difficile toxin antigens such as TcdA and TcdB and/or C. difficile colonization factor antigens such as FliD and Cwp84.</p>In the context of the present invention, an antibody is said to \u201cbind\u201d a define antigen (or epitope) or to \u201crecognize\u201d said antigen (or epitope) if said antibody has an affinity constant K<sub>a </sub>(which is the inverted dissociation constant, i.e. 1/K<sub>d</sub>) higher than 10<sup>5 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>, preferably higher than 10<sup>6 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>, more preferably higher than 10<sup>7 </sup>M<sup>\u22121 </sup>for said antigen (or epitope). This affinity can be measured for example by equilibrium dialysis or by fluorescence quenching, both technologies being routinely used in the art.</p>In a preferred embodiment, the method of the invention is carried out by an ELISA assay.</p>An ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) assay requires the use of antigens as described in the present invention, said antigens being immobilized on a solid support, preferably a microtiter plate. An ELISA assay according to the invention is disclosed in the experimental part of the application. ELISA assays are broadly used and well-described in the art.</p>Of note, the detection of the analytes (e.g., the antibodies of the invention) is enhanced by adjusting the amount of detergent present in the buffers used in the immunoassay (washing, coating and/or dilution buffers). A poor concentration of detergent will indeed favor unspecific binding, matrix effects, and/or cross reactivity with interference substances that are present in the analyzed samples.</p>To avoid occurrence of these interferences, it is for example possible to use sodium deoxycholate as detergent, in a concentration from 0.1% to 0.18%. The skilled person will be capable to adjust this amount to each antibody to detect. It is also possible "
