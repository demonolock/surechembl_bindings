The antigen binding domain can be an antibody or aptamer, receptor, ligand etc.</p>In one preferred embodiment, the invention provides for antibody fusion molecules comprising: F<sub>c </sub>region, C<sub>H</sub>1, C<sub>H</sub>2 and/or C<sub>H</sub>3, Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032)<sub>2</sub>, single chain Fv (S<sub>c</sub>Fv) and Fv fragments,",
    "entified by testing the molecules in a functional assay. For instance, a molecule can be screened for suitability as a carrier domain by fusing the molecule to an anti-angiogenic agent and testing the fusion for purity and yield in an in vitro assay. The purity of recombinant proteins can be estimated by conventional techniques, for example, SDS-PAGE followed by the staining of gels with Coomassie-Blue.</p>A number of other carrier domains can be used to impart an effector function to the chimeric molecule. These include other cytotoxins, drugs, detectable labels, targeting ligands, and delivery vehicles. Examples of these are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,518,061 and U.S. published patent application number 20020159972.</p>A preferred carrier domain for use in the chimeric molecule is an Ig or portion of an Ig. The Ig domain may take the form of a single chain antibody (e.g., a scFV), an Fab fragment, an F(ab\u2032)<sub>2 </sub>fragment, an Ig heavy chain, or an Ig in which one or more of the constant regions has been removed. The Ig domain can be derived from any Ig class including IgG, IgM, IgE, IgA, IgD and any subclass thereof. In some applications, it is preferred that the Ig domain includes a large hinge region, e.g., one from IgG3.</p>In another preferred embodiment, the Ig domain is a minibody. A small protein scaffold called a \u201cminibody\u201d was designed using a part of the Ig VH domain as the template (Pessi et al., Nature, 362:367-69 (1993)). Minibodies with high affinity (dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) about 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>M) to interleukin-6 were identified by randomizing loops corresponding to CDR1 and CDR2 of VH and then selecting mutants using the phage display method (Martin et al., EMBO J. 1994 Nov. 15; 13(22): 5303-5309). These experiments demonstrated that the essence of the antibody function could be transferred to a smaller system. Thus, the chimeric fusion molecule may comprise a minibody Ig domain.</p>Chimeric molecules can be prepared using conventional techniques in molecular biology or protein chemistry. Where the chimeric molecule is a fusion protein, molecular biology methods can be used to join two or more genes in frame into a single nucleic acid. The nucleic acid can then be expressed in an appropriate host cell under conditions in which the chimeric molecule is produced. A carrier domain might also be conjugated (e.g., covalently bonded) to an anti-angiogenic agent domain by other methods known in the art for conjugating two such molecules together. For example, the anti-angiogenic agent domain can be chemically derivatized with a carrier domain either directly or using a linker (spacer). Several methods and reagents (e.g., cross-linkers) for mediating this conjugation are known. See, e.g., catalog of Pierce Chemical Company; and Means and Feeney, Chemical Modification of Proteins, Holden-Day Inc., San Francisco, Calif. 1971; \u201cMonoclonal Antibody-Toxin Conjugates: Aiming the Magic Bullet,\u201d Thorpe et al., Monoclonal",

The TCA precipitable radioactivity in each blood sample was measured in a \u03b3-counter. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by fitting plasma radioactivity data to a bi-exponential equation as described previously (Shin S U, et al. J Immunol. 1997; 158(10):4797-804, Yoshikawa T et al. J Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 263:897; Penichet M L. et al.

Data were weighed using weight=1/(concentration)<sup>2</sup>, where concentration was either count per minute (cpm) per microliter (\u03bcl) or % ID (percentage of injected dose) per milliliter. Area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) and mean residence time (MRT) were calculated from the slopes and intercept of the bi-exponential equation. The volume of distribution (V<sub>D</sub>) of the antibodies was determined from the ratio of disintegrations per minute per gram of organ divided by disintegrations per minute per microliters of corresponding plasma at each time after injection. The organ permeability-surface area product (Ki) of the antibodies was calculated from:</p>Ki=[V<sub>D</sub>\u2212V<sub>0</sub>]C<sub>P</sub>(T)/AUC(t)</p>where Cp(T) is the terminal plasma concentration and V<sub>0 </sub>is the organ plasma volume.
