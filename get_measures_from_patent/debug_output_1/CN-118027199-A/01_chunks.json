    "entration of saturated ammonium sulfate and desalted by PBS at 4deg.C for 24h, with 3 changes. The crude purified antibody was further purified by using an AKTA Protein purification system, followed by 1ml Protein G purification cartridge, according to the purification manual provided by GE company. The obtained antibody pure product is used for subsequent antibody detection and function experiments. And (3) performing BCA quantitative detection on the pure antibody product to obtain the protein concentration of the pure antibody product. 20ug of protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and it was found that the pure antibody had a single band at 150kDa, and after reduction with mercaptoethanol, light and heavy bands at 25kDa and 50kDa, respectively (as shown in FIG. 2).</p>3. Monoclonal antibody titer detection</p>Pure 5G2 antibody was incubated with 2X 10 <sup>5</sup> K562-CD138 at room temperature for 30min, PBS was used for 2 times, 1 ul/well of APC-labeled anti-mouse F (ab) <sub>2</sub> secondary antibody was added, incubated at room temperature for 30min in dark place, PBS was used for two times, after washing with PBS for 2 times, and the 5G2 antibody was purified at final concentrations of 200nM, 100nM, 50nM, 25nM, 12.5nM, 6,25nM, 3.2nM, 1.6nM, 0.8nM, 0.4nM, 0.2nM, 0.1nM, 0.05nM, 0.025nM, and 2X 10 <sup>5</sup> K562-CD138 secondary antibody was added; cells were resuspended in 200 \u03bcl PBS buffer, fluorescence intensity was measured by FACS, and Mean values were counted. The Kd values of the antibodies were calculated using data analysis software GRAPHPAD PRISM. The Kd value of 5G2 is 0.8957 X10 <sup>-9</sup> M. (the results are shown in FIG. 3)</p>4. Cloning of 5G2 variable region Gene by RT-PCR method</p>Total RNA extraction, single-stranded cDNA synthesis:</p> Total RNA of the 5G2 hybridoma cell line was extracted with TRIzol reagent, and cDNA library was synthesized using reverse transcriptase with RNA as a template. RT-PCR amplification of heavy chain (VH) and light chain (VL) variable region gene fragments of anti-human CD138 antibody, and the primer sequences are shown in Table 1: </p> TABLE 1 </p></p>The PCR reaction system (50. Mu.l) was prepared as follows:</p> 2 \u03bcl of cDNA; 2. Mu.l of the upstream primer (10. Mu.M); 2. Mu.l of the downstream primer (10. Mu.M); 25 \u03bcl of 2 Xpfu DNA polymerase; ddH <sub>2</sub> O was added to 50. Mu.l. Reaction conditions: pre-denaturation at 95 \u2103 for 5min; the following cycle was repeated 35 times: 95 \u2103 for 30s,58 \u2103 for 30s and 72 \u2103 for 1min; finally, the extension is carried out at 72\u2103for 10min. The VL and VH fragments were separated and recovered by agarose gel electrophoresis. The recovered VL and VH fragments were ligated with pMD19-T (simple) vector (Takara Co.) using T4 ligase (Takara Co.) in the following manner: VL PCR product/VH PCR product 70ng each; 1 \u03bcl of pMD19-T (simple) vector; solution I was added to the reaction mixture in an amount of 5. Mu.l; ddH <sub>2</sub> O was made up to 10. Mu.l. After overnight ligation at 4\u2103and transformation of the ligation products into E.coli DH 5. "
