A single antigen may have more than one epitope. Thus, different antibodies may bind to different areas on an antigen and may have different biological effects. Epitopes may be either conformational or linear. A conformational epitope is produced by spatially juxtaposed amino acids from different segments of the linear polypeptide chain. A linear epitope is one produced by adjacent amino acid residues in a polypeptide chain. In certain circumstance, an epitope may include moieties of saccharides, phosphoryl groups, or sulfonyl groups on the antigen.</p>The term \u201csubstantial identity\u201d or \u201csubstantially identical,\u201d when referring to a nucleic acid or fragment thereof, indicates that, when optimally aligned with appropriate nucleotide insertions or deletions with another nucleic acid (or its complementary strand), there is nucleotide sequence identity in at least about 95%, and more preferably at least about 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% of the nucleotide bases, as measured by any well-known algorithm of sequence identity, such as FASTA, BLAST or Gap, as discussed below. A nucleic acid molecule having substantial identity to a reference nucleic acid molecule may, in certain instances, encode a polypeptide having the same or substantially similar a",
    "1H706, H1M724 and/or H2M744).</p>One can easily determine whether an antibody binds to the same epitope as, or competes for binding with, a reference anti-Ang-2 antibody by using routine methods known in the art. For example, to determine if a test antibody binds to the same epitope as a reference anti-Ang-2 antibody of the invention, the reference antibody is allowed to bind to an Ang-2 protein or peptide under saturating conditions. Next, the ability of a test antibody to bind to the Ang-2 molecule is assessed. If the test antibody is able to bind to Ang-2 following saturation binding with the reference anti-Ang-2 antibody, it can be concluded that the test antibody binds to a different epitope than the reference anti-Ang-2 antibody. On the other hand, if the test antibody is not able to bind to the Ang-2 molecule following saturation binding with the reference anti-Ang-2 antibody, then the test antibody may bind to the same epitope as the epitope bound by the reference anti-Ang-2 antibody of the invention. Additional routine experimentation (e.g., peptide mutation and binding analyses) can then be carried out to confirm whether the observed lack of binding of the test antibody is in fact due to binding to the same epitope as the reference antibody or if steric blocking (or another phenomenon) is responsible for the lack of observed binding. Experiments of this sort can be performed using ELISA, RIA, Biacore, flow cytometry or any other quantitative or qualitative antibody-binding assay available in the art. In accordance with certain embodiments of the present invention, two antibodies bind to the same (or overlapping) epitope if, e.g., a 1-, 5-, 10-, 20- or 100-fold excess of one antibody inhibits binding of the other by at least 50% but preferably 75%, 90% or even 99% as measured in a competitive binding assay (see, e.g., Junghans et al., Cancer Res. 1990:50:1495-1502). Alternatively, two antibodies are deemed to bind to the same epitope if essentially all amino acid mutations in the antigen that reduce or eliminate binding of one antibody reduce or eliminate binding of the other. Two antibodies are deemed to have \u201coverlapping epitopes\u201d if only a subset of the amino acid mutations that reduce or eliminate binding of one antibody reduce or eliminate binding of the other.</p>To determine if an antibody competes for binding with a reference anti-Ang-2 antibody, the above-described binding methodology is performed in two orientations: In a first orientation, the reference antibody is allowed to bind to an Ang-2 molecule under saturating conditions followed by assessment of binding of the test antibody to the Ang-2 molecule. In a second orientation, the test antibody is allowed to bind to an Ang-2 molecule under saturating conditions followed by assessment of binding of the reference antibody to the Ang-2 molecule. If, in both orientations, only the first (saturating) antibody is capable of binding to the Ang-2 molecule, then it is concluded that the test antibody and the reference antibody compete for binding to Ang-2. As will be appreciated by a person of ordinary skill in the art, an antibody that competes for binding with a reference antibody may not necessarily bind to the same epitope as the reference antibody, but may sterically block binding of the reference antibo",
