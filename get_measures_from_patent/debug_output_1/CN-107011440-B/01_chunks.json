    " antigen specificities (e.g., an isolated antibody that specifically binds to CLDN6 is an antibody that is substantially free of antibodies that specifically bind to antigens other than CLDN 6). However, an isolated antibody that specifically binds to an epitope, isoform or variant of human CLDN6 may have cross-reactivity with other related antigens (e.g., from other species), such as species homologs of CLDN 6. Furthermore, the isolated antibody may be substantially free of other cellular material and/or chemicals.

The correct orientation of the constant region in the vector was verified by sequencing (i.e., promoter proper to the vector was performed forward).
