E., et al., European Journal of Cancer, Vol. 30A ( 4), 484-490 (1994)).are rinsed twice in PBS, phenol red free Trypsin-EDTA is diluted in \n\nthe same PBS 1:10 . The cell layers are rinsed with IX Trypsin, extra Trypsin is poured out, and the cell layers are incubated at 370C for ~ 2 min. The flask is tapped and checked to for signs of cell detachment. Once the cells are starting to sliding off the flask, the complete media is added to kill the trypsin. The cells are counted at this point, then diluted to the appropriate concentration and split into flasks or dishes for further culturing (Usually 1:3 to 1:6 dilution). Preparation of MDA-MB-453 Cell Lvsate</p>When the MDA cells are 70 to 85% confluent, they are detached as described above, and collected by centrifuging at 1000 g for 10 min at 4 oc. The cell pellet is washed 2x with TEGM (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM Sodium Molybdate, pH 7.2). After the final wash, the cells are resuspended in TEGM at a concentration of 107 cells/mL. The cell suspension is snap frozen in liquid N2 or ethanol dry ice bath and transferred to -80 oC freezer on dry ice. Before setting up the binding assay, the frozen samples are left on ice-water to just thaw (~1 hr). Then the samples are centrifuged at 12,500 g to 20,000 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant is used to set-up assay right away. If using 50 \u03bcL of supernatant, the test compound can be prepared in 50 \u03bcL of the TEGM buffer. Procedure for Multiple Compound Screening: lx TEGM buffer is prepared, and the isotope-containing assay mixture is prepared in the following order: EtOH (2% final Cone, in reaction), 3H-R1881 or 3H-DHT (0.5 nM final Cone, in reaction) and lx TEGM. [eg. For 100 samples, 200 \u03bcL (100 x 2) of EtOH + 4.25 \u03bcL of 1:10 3H-R1881 stock + 2300 \u03bcL (100 x 23) lx TEGM]. The compound is serially diluted, e.g., if starting final cone, is 1 \u03bcM, and the compound is in 25 \u03bcL of solution, for duplicate samples, 75 \u03bcL of 4x1 \u03bcM solution is made and 3 \u03bcL of 100 \u03bcM is added to 72 \u03bcL of buffer, and 1:5 serial dilution.</p>25\u03bcL of 3H-R1881 trace and 25 \u03bcL compound solution are first mixed together, followed by addition of 50 \u03bcL receptor solution. The reaction is gently mixed, spun briefly at about 200 rpm and incubated at 40C overnight. 100 \u03bcL of 50% HAP slurry is prepared and 100 \u03bcL of 50% HAP slurry is added to the incubated reaction which is then vortexed and incubated on ice for 5 to 10 minutes. The reaction mixture is vortexed twice more to resuspend HAP while incubating reaction. The samples in 96-well format are then washed in wash buffer using The FilterMate\u2122 Universal Harvester plate washer (Packard). The washing process transfers HAP \n\npellet containing ligand-bound expressed receptor to Unifilter-96 GF/B filter plate (Packard). The HAP pellet on the filter plate is incubated with 50 \u03bcL of MICROSCINT (Packard) scintillint for V2 hour before being counted on the TopCount micro scintillation counter (Packard). IC50S are calculated using R1881 as a reference. Tissue selective androgen receptor modulators of the present invention typically have IC50 values of 1 micromolar or less.</p>MMPl Promoter Suppression, Transient Transfection Assay (TRAMPS)</p>HepG2 cells are cultured in phenol red free MEM containing 10 % charcoal-treated FCS at 37C with 5% CO2- For transfection, cells are plated at 10,000 cells/well in</p>96 well white, clear bottom plates. Twenty four hours later, cells are co-transfected with a MMPl promoter-luciferase reporter construct and a rhesus monkey expression construct (50 : 1 ratio) using FuGENE6 transfection reagent, following the protocol recommended by manufacture. The MMPl promoter-luciferase reporter construct is generated by insertion of a human MMPl promoter fragment (-179/+63) into pGL2 luciferase reporter construct (Promega) and a rhesus monkey AR expression construct is generated in a CMV-Tag2B expression vector (Stratagene). Cells are further cultured for 24 hours and then treated with ligands in the presence of 100 nM phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), used to increase the basal activity of MMPl promoter. The ligands are added at this point, at a range of lOOOnM to 0.03nM, 10 dilutions, at a concentration on 10X, 1/lOth volume, (example: 10 microliters of ligand at 10X added to 100 microliters of media already in the well.) Cells are futher cultured for additional 48 hours. Cells are then washed twice with PBS and lysed by adding 70 \u03bcL of Lysis Buffer (lx, Promega) to the wells. The luciferase activity is measured in a 96 well format using a 1450 Microbeta Jet (Perkin Elmer) luminometer. AR agonism of tissue selective androgen receptor modulators is presented as suppression of luciferase signal from the PMA-stimulated control levels EC50 and</p>Emax values are reported. Tissue selective androgen receptor modulators of the present invention typically agonize repression typically with submicromolar EC50 values and Emax values greater than about 50%. References:</p>1.

The ability of test compounds to antagonize the action of R1881 is calculated as the relative luminescence compared to the value with 0.3 nM R1881 alone.

Each rat is weighed, then anesthetized by isoflurane gas that is maintained to effect. A 1.5 cm anteroposterior incision is made in the scrotum. The right testicle is exteriorized. The spermatic artery and vas deferens is ligated with 4.0 silk 0.5cm proximal to the testicle. The testicle is freed by one cut of a small surgical scissors distal to the ligation site. The tissue stump is returned to the scrotum. The same is repeated for the left testicle. When both stumps are returned to the scrotum, the scrotum and overlying skin are sutured closed with 4.0 silk. For Sham-ORX, all procedures excepting ligation and scissors cutting are completed. The rats fully recover consciousness and full mobility within 10-15 minutes.</p>A dose of test compound is administered subcutaneously or orally to the rat immediately after the surgical incision is sutured.
