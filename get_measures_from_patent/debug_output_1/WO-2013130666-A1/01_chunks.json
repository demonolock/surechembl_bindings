    "embodiments, the alkylated cyclodextrin composition comprises less than 1% wt., less than 0.5% wt., less than 0.2% wt., less than 0.1% wt., less than 0.08% wt., or less than 0.05% wt. of an alkali metal halide salt. </p>[0134] In some embodiments, the alkylated cyclodextrin composition comprises less than 1% wt, less than 0.5% wt., less than 0.25% wt., less than 0.1% wt., less than 0.08% wt., or less than 0.05% wt. of a hydro lyzed alkylating agent. </p>[0135] In some embodiments, the alkylated cyclodextrin composition comprises less than 500 ppm, less than 100 ppm, less than 50 ppm, less than 20 ppm, less than 10 ppm, less than 5 ppm, less than 2 ppm, less than 1 ppm, less than 500 ppb, or less than 250 ppb of an alkylating agent. </p> [0136] In some embodiments, the alkylated cyclodextrin composition comprises less than 0.5% wt, less than 0.2% wt., less than 0.1% wt., or less than 0.08% wt. of underivatized cyclodextrin. </p> [0137] By \"complexed\" is meant \"being part of a clathrate or inclusion complex with,\" i.e., a \"complexed\" therapeutic agent is part of a clathrate or inclusion complex with an alkylated cyclodextrin. The term \"major portion\" refers to 50% or greater, by weight, or on a molar basis. Thus, a formulation according to the present invention can contain an active agent of which more than about 50% by weight is complexed with an alkylated cyclodextrin. The actual percentage of active agent that is complexed will vary according to the complexation equilibrium binding constant characterizing the complexation of a specific cyclodextrin with a specific active agent. The invention also includes embodiments wherein the active agent is not complexed with the cyclodextrin or in which only a minor portion of the active agent is complexed with the alkylated cyclodextrin. It should be noted that an alkylated cyclodextrin, can form one or more ionic bonds with a positively charged compound. This ionic association can occur regardless of whether the positively charged compound is complexed with the cyclodextrin by inclusion complexation. </p> [0138] As shown in FIG. 6, after ultrafiltration of the crude SBE-CD product, impurities such as \u03b2-cyclodextrin and 4-hydroxybutane-l -sulfonic acid (4-HBSA) are present. After a second column with activated carbon, the amount of \u03b2- cyclodextrin and 4- hydroxybutane-1 -sulfonic acid impurities have been reduced. However, as shown in FIG. 6, there are high amounts of chloride present in the product after the two columns. </p> [0139] In the purification process using the activated carbon, although drug-degrading agents have been reduced, high amounts of chloride are present in the alkylated \n\n cyclodextrin product. This high amount of chloride in the alkylated cyclodextrin product may react with an active agent and cause degradation of the active agent. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the chloride levels in the alkylated cyclodextrin product, in particular when the active agent is sensitive to chlorid"
