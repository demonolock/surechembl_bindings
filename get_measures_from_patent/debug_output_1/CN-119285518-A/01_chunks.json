For example, the lipids of the present disclosure may be used in lipid plasmids or Lipid Nanoparticles (LNPs) for encapsulation and delivery of nucleic acids.</p>In some embodiments, the lipids of the present disclosure may be ionizable. In some embodiments, the lipids of the present disclosure are ionizable cationic lipids that are positively charged (thus bind nucleic acids, such as RNA) at low pH and become neutral at physiological pH, which helps reduce toxicity of the LNP-RNA complex in vivo. Lipids can serve two key functions, including facilitating the encapsulation of nucleic acids in LNP and mediating endosomal membrane disruption to enable release of nucleic acids into the cytosol. In some embodiments, the lipid may directly effect endosomal uptake by its interaction between positively and negatively charged cell membranes or by binding to plasma proteins that support cellular uptake (endosomal uptake).</p>In some embodiments, the lipid may be deprotonated under neutral conditions and may be positively charged at a pH below its acid dissociation constant (pK <sub>a</sub>). The pK <sub>a</sub> value should be high enough to allow the lipid to be positively charged at low pH, yet be able to bind to negatively charged RNA molecules and form LNP. Thus, at low endosomal pH, the positive charge of the ionizable amine-containing lipid allows it to interact with endogenous anionic lipids, thereby causing disruption of endosomal structure and release of LNP cargo into the cytoplasm. At the same time, the pK <sub>a</sub> value of the ionizable amine-containing lipid should be low enough that at physiological pH, the surface charge of the LNP will remain relatively neutral, while the toxicity and immunogenicity of the resulting LNP can be modulated and its circulation time increased. In some embodiments, the pK <sub>a</sub> of the protonated form of the lipid is about 5.0 to about 9.0, such as about 5.5, about 6.0, about 6.5, about 7.0, or greater, or about 8.5, about 8.0, about 7.5, about 7.0, or less. The pKa value of the lipid can be critical for efficient LNP delivery and transfection efficacy.</p>The present disclosure further provides an active agent delivery vehicle comprising a lipid or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, hydrate, polymorph, tautomer, stereoisomer, or isotopically enriched derivative thereof.</p>In some embodiments, the active agent delivery vehicle may be a drug delivery system, such as a liposome, a single emulsion, a micelle, a nanoemulsion, a Lipid Nanoparticle (LNP), a Nanostr"
