    "buffer (Life technologies buffer Q, PV5125, diluted 5 times supplemented with 2 mM DTT and 2 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>). 2.5 \u00b5l of the diluted compounds were added to a 384 well assay plate followed by 2.5 \u00b5l of 16.5 nM Vps34 enzyme (Life technologies, PV5126). Enzyme and compounds were pre-incubated at rt for 15 min. Then 5 \u00b5l of substrate mix containing 20 \u00b5M ATP (Life technologies, PV3227) and 200 \u00b5M PI:PS substrate (Life technologies, PV5122) in assay buffer was added to the wells containing compound and enzyme. Mixing was performed by pipetting several times. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Then 5 \u00b5l stop-detection mix, prepared as described in the Adapta kinase assay kit instructions (Life technologies, PV5099) containing Adapta Eu-anti-ADP antibody (2.3 nM), Alexa Fluor 647 ADP tracer (9 nM) and EDTA (30 mM) in TR-FRET buffer, was added to quench the reaction. Mixing was performed by pipetting several times. The assay plate was then incubated at room temperature for 30 min and read with Artemis micro plate reader. Percent inhibition of the compounds as compared to DMSO treated control samples was calculated. By the use of Dotmatics software compound concentration versus percent inhibition was fitted to generate IC<sub>50</sub> values.</p>The example compounds effectively inhibited Vps34 and the results of the assay are shown in Table 1 (Median IC<sub>50</sub> \u00b5M Adapta).\nTable 1.

For that purpose, autophagy was activated by using the mTOR inhibitor KU-0063794 at 500nM in the presence of Bafilomycin A1 (Sigma-Aldrich) at 5nM. Shortly, cells were plated overnight in clear bottom 96-well plates in DMEM-High Modified media (Hi-Clone Cat # SH30285.01). At the start of the experiment, the media was removed and replaced with fresh media containing the mTOR inhibitor, Bafilomycin A1 and the vehicle or a test compound as indicated. After 6 hours the media was removed, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes at room temperature. Then the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS before adding Hoechst 33342 at 1\u00b5g/ml in PBS for nuclear staining. After incubation overnight at 4\u00b0C, cells were washed once with PBS to remove the excess of dye and 100 \u00b5l of PBS was added to each well. Images were acquired at 20x magnification, 6 images per well, using the ImageXpress automated microscope (Molecular Devices Inc.) and analyzed with MetaXpress software to identify LC3-GFP foci. Foci area per cell values were used to generate dose response curves and IC50 values were calculated using the non-linear fitting analysis in GraphPad Prism software.</p>The tested example compounds effectively inhibited autophagy in HOS cells.
