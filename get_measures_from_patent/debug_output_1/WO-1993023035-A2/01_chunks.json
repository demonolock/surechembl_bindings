    "ecentrifuged at 18,000 \n\n - A - r.p.m for 15 in at 4\u00b0C in a Sorvall RC5C. The membranes were washed two more times with ice-cold 50 mM Tris salts (pH 7.4 ^a 37\u00b0C) . The final pellet was resuspended in 50 mM Tris salts (pH 7.4 @ 37\u00b0C) , and the protein content determined using bovine serum albumin as a standard (Bradford, M. M. (1976) Anal. Biochem. 72, 248-254) .</p>Binding experiments on cloned dopamine receptors</p>Crude cell membranes were incubated with 0.1 n [~^I] iodosulpride (~2000 Ci/mmol; Amersham, U. K.), 50 mM Tris salts (pH 7.4 @ 37\u00b0C), 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KC1, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, in a total volume of 1 ml for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Following incubation, samples were filtered using a Brandel Cell Harvester, and washed three times with ice-cold 50 mM Tris salts (pH 7.4 Q 37\u00b0C) , 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KC1, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1 mM MgCl2- The radioactivity on the filters was measured using a Cobra gamma counter (Canberra Packard) . Non-specific binding was defined as the radioligand binding remaining after incubation in the presence of 100 \u03bcM iodosulpride. For competition curves, 14 concentrations (half-log dilutions) of competing cold drug were used.</p>Competition curves were analysed simultaneously whenever possible using non-linear least-squares fitting procedures, capable of fitting one, two or three site models.</p>RESULTS</p>The binding data revealed the existence of two binding sites in both human D<sub>2</sub> and D3 receptors. The inhibition constant {Kj for ropinirole at the high affinity site was found to be 1380 nM (n=5) at D<sub>2</sub> and 69.1 nM (n=6) at D3 receptors. These results indicate that ropinirole binds selectively (20 fold) to human D3 dopamine receptors. \n</p>"
