    "nM <sup>3</sup> H-YM 09151-2 and the compound of interest in a total incubation of 1.0 ml. Nonspecific binding is defined as that binding found in the presence of 1 mM spiperone; without further additions, nonspecific binding is less than 20% of total binding. The binding characteristics of examples of this patent for the D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> receptor subtypes are shown in Table 2 for Rat Striatal Homogenates.</p>              TABLE 2                                                     \n______________________________________                                    \nCompound Number.sup.1                                                     \n                D.sub.2 K.sub.i (mM)                                      \n                          D3 K.sub.i (mM)                                 \n______________________________________                                    \n1               2.380     &gt;100                                            \n2               1.420     &gt;100                                            \n3               1.937     &gt;100                                            \n______________________________________                                    \n .sup.1 Compound numbers relate to compounds shown in Table 1 above.      \n</pre></p>Assay for D<sub>4</sub> receptor binding activityClonal cell lines expressing the human dopamine D<sub>4</sub> receptor subtype were harvested in PBS and the cells centrifuged and the pellets stored at -80\u00b0 C. until used in the binding assay. The pellets were resuspended and the cells lysed at 4\u00b0 C. in 50 mM Tris pH 7.4 buffer containing 120 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. The homogenate is centrifuged at 48000\u00d7g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. The resulting pellet is resuspended in fresh buffer and centrifuged again. After resuspension of the pellet in fresh buffer a 100 ml aliquot is removed for protein determination. The remaining homogenate is centrifuged as above, the supernatant removed and the pellet stored at 4\u00b0 C. until needed at which time it is resuspended to a final concentration of 625 mg/ml (250 mg per sample) with 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4) and 120 mM NaCl just prior to use. Incubations were carried out for 60 minutes at 25\u00b0 C. in the presence of 0.1 nM [<sup>3</sup> H]YM-09151-2. The incubation was terminated by rapid filtration through Whatman GF/C filters and rinsed with 2\u00d74 ml washes of chilled 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4) and 120 mM NaCl. Non-specific binding was determined with 1 mM spiperone and radioactivity determined by counting in an LKB beta counter. Binding parameters were determined by non-linear least squares regression analysis, from which the inhibition constant Ki could be calculated for each test compound. The binding characteristics of some examples of this invention are shown in Table 3 for the dopamine D<sub>4</sub> binding assay. In general, compounds of the accompanying Examples were tested in the above assay, and all were found to possess a Ki value for the displacement of [<sup>3</sup> H]YM-09151-2 from the human dopamine D<sub>4</sub> receptor subtype of below 500 nM.
