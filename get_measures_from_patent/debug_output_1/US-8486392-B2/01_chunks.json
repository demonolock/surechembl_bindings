    "proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In exemplary embodiments, the antibody can be purified as measurable by any of at least three different methods: 1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method, preferably more than 99% by weight; 2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator; or 3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or non-reducing conditions using Coomasie blue or silver stain. Isolated antibody can include an antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, an isolated antibody can be prepared by at least one purification step.</p>An \u201cantigenic region\u201d, \u201cantigenic determinant\u201d, or \u201cepitope\u201d includes any protein determinant capable of specific binding to an antibody. This is the site on an antigen to which each distinct antibody molecule binds. Epitopic determinants can be active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and may have specific three-dimensional structural characteristics or charge characteristics.</p>\u201cAntibody specificity\u201d refers to an antibody that has a stronger binding affinity for an antigen from a first subject species than it has for a homologue of that antigen from a second subject species. Typically, an antibody \u201cbinds specifically\u201d to a human antigen (e.g., has a binding affinity (Kd) value of no more than about 1\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M, preferably no more than about 1\u00d710<sup>\u22128</sup>M, and most preferably no more than about 1\u00d710<sup>\u22129 </sup>M) but has a binding affinity for a homologue of the antigen from a second subject species which is at least about 50-fold, or at least about 500-fold, or at least about 1000-fold, weaker than its binding affinity for the human antigen. The antibodies can be of any of the various types of antibodies as described herein, such as humanized or fully human antibodies.</p>An antibody \u201cselectively\u201d or \u201cspecifically\u201d binds a target protein when the antibody binds the target protein and does not significantly bind to unrelated proteins. An antibody can still be considered to selectively or specifically bind a target protein even if it also binds to other proteins that are not substantially homologous with the target protein as long as such proteins share homology with a fragment or domain of the target protein. In this case, it would be understood that antibody binding to the target protein is still selective despite some degree of cross-reactivity.</p>Exemplary embodiments of the invention provide an \u201cantibody variant\u201d, which refers to an amino acid sequence variant of an antibody wherein one or more of the amino acid residues have been modified. Such variants necessarily have less than 100% sequence identity with the amino acid sequence of the antibody, and have at least 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% amino a",
    "on levels of a protein in healthy subjects) can be established, such as by combining body fluids, tissues, or cell extracts taken from a normal healthy mammalian or human subject with specific antibodies to a protein under conditions for complex formation. Standard values for complex formation in normal and disease tissues can be established by various methods, such as photometric means. Complex formation, as it is expressed in a test sample, can be compared with the standard values. Deviation from a normal standard and toward a disease standard can provide parameters for disease diagnosis or prognosis while deviation away from a disease standard and toward a normal standard can be used to evaluate treatment efficacy, for example.</p>Immunological methods for detecting and measuring complex formation as a measure of protein expression using either specific polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies are known in the art. Examples of such techniques include ELISAs, radioimmunoassays (RIAs), flow cytometry (also referred to as fluorescence-activated cell sorting, or FACS), and antibody arrays. Such immunoassays typically involve the measurement of complex formation between a protein and its specific antibody. These assays and their quantitation against purified, labeled standards are well known in the art (Ausubel, supra, unit 10.1-10.6). For example, a two-site, monoclonal-based immunoassay utilizing antibodies reactive to two non-interfering epitopes can be utilized, and competitive binding assay can also be utilized (Pound (1998) Immunochemical Protocols, Humana Press, Totowa N.J.).</p>For diagnostic applications, an antibody can be labeled with a detectable moiety (interchangeably referred to as a \u201clabel\u201d or \u201cdetectable substance\u201d), such as to facilitate detection by various imaging methods. Methods for detection of labels include, but are not limited to, fluorescence, light, confocal, and electron microscopy; magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy; fluoroscopy, computed tomography and positron emission tomography. Examples of suitable labels include, but are not limited to, fluorescein, rhodamine, eosin and other fluorophores, radioisotopes, gold, gadolinium and other lanthanides, paramagnetic iron, fluorine-18 and other positron-emitting radionuclides. Additionally, labels may be bi- or multi-functional and be detectable by more than one of the methods listed. Antibodies may be directly or indirectly labeled. Attachment of labels to antibodies includes covalent attachment of a label, incorporation of a label into an antibody, and covalent attachment of a chelating compound for binding of a label, among others well known in the art.</p>Numerous detectable moieties are available for labeling antibodies, including, but not limited to, those in the following categories:</p>(a) Radioisotopes, such as <sup>36</sup>S, <sup>14</sup>C, <sup>125</sup>I, <sup>3</sup>H, and <sup>131</sup>I. An antibody can be labeled with a radioisotope using the techniques",
    " amount of standard that becomes bound, the antibodies generally are insolubilized before or after the competition. As a result, the standard and test sample that are bound to the antibodies can be separated from the standard and test sample that remain unbound.</p>Sandwich assays typically involve the use of two antibodies, each capable of binding to a different immunogenic portion, or epitope, of the protein to be detected. In typical sandwich assays, the test sample to be analyzed is bound by a first antibody, which is immobilized on a solid support, and thereafter a second antibody binds to the test sample, thus forming an insoluble three-part complex (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,376,110). The second antibody can itself be labeled with a detectable moiety (direct sandwich assays) or can be measured using an anti-immunoglobulin antibody that is labeled with a detectable moiety (indirect sandwich assay). For example, one type of sandwich assay is an ELISA assay, in which case the detectable moiety is an enzyme.</p>Antibodies can also be used for in vivo diagnostic assays. Generally, an antibody can be labeled with a radionuclide (such as <sup>111</sup>In, <sup>99</sup>Tc, <sup>14</sup>C, <sup>131</sup>I, <sup>3</sup>H, <sup>32</sup>P or <sup>35</sup>S) so that disease cells or tissues can be localized using immunoscintiography, for example. In certain embodiment, antibodies or fragments thereof bind to the extracellular domains of two or more CAT proteins and the affinity value (Kd) is less than 1\u00d710<sup>8 </sup>M.</p>For immunohistochemistry, a disease tissue sample may be, for example, fresh or frozen or may be embedded in paraffin and fixed with a preservative such as formalin. A fixed or embedded section can be contacted with a labeled primary antibody and secondary antibody, wherein the antibody is used to detect CAT protein expression in situ.</p>Antibodies can be used to detect a target protein in situ, in vitro, or in a cell lysate or supernatant in order to evaluate the abundance and pattern of expression. Also, antibodies can be used to assess abnormal tissue distribution or abnormal expression during development or progression of a biological condition. Antibodies against CAT proteins are useful for detecting the presence of the proteins in cells or tissues to determine the pattern of expression of the proteins among various tissues in an organism and over the course of the organism's development.</p>Further, antibodies can be used to assess expression in disease states such as in active stages of a disease or in an individual with a predisposition toward disease related to the protein's function. When a disorder is caused by inappropriate tissue distribution, developmental expression, or level of expression of a protein, or expressed/processed form, for example, an antibody can be prepared against the normal protein. If a disorder is characterized by a specific mutation in a protein, antibodies specific for the mutant protein can be used "
