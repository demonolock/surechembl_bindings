    "nvention, the methods involve inhibiting the anticoagulation effect of an anticoagulant. Exemplary anticoagulants are thrombin inhibitors, including both indirect thrombin inhibitors and DTIs. Indirect thrombin inhibitors include, for example, heparin, coumarin, dermatan, and thrombomodulin. DTIs include, for example, argatroban or derivatives or analogs thereof, hirudin or recombinant or synthetic derivatives or analogs thereof, derivatives of the tripeptide Phe-Pro-Arg, chloromethylketone derivatives, ximelagatran or derivatives, metabolites, or analogs thereof, an anion binding exosite inhibitor such as Triabin, and an RNA/DNA aptamer (see, e.g., Noeske-Jungblut et al. (1995) J. Biol. Chem., 270:28629-28634; Jeter et al. (2004) FEBS Letters, 568:10-14). Recombinant or synthetic derivatives or analogs (\u201chirulogs\u201d) of hirudin include, but are not limited to, bivalirudin, lepirudin, and desirudin. Metabolites of ximelagatran include, but are not limited to, melagatran.</p>In particular embodiments, the DTI is argatroban. Argatroban is a synthetic anticoagulant whose effect is based on the formation of a chemical complex with thrombin's catalytic domain (also called the active site). Binding of argatroban results in a loss of thrombin's catalytic action and in turn results in the inhibition of the activation of platelets and fibrin formation. Argatroban is a small arginine-derived thrombin inhibitor with a molecular weight of 526.66. Owing to its strong affinity for thrombin (Ki values of 0.04 \u03bcmol/l) and its direct mechanism of action, its clinical application includes anticoagulation for patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Despite the beneficial effects, however, clinical use of argatroban has been limited in part because no antidote has been available. Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, methods are provided for the inhibition of the anticoagulation effect of argatroban comprising administration to a patient in need thereof a variant prothrombin or thrombin, particularly thrombin mutants W215A/E217A, W215A, and variants thereof.</p>In another embodiment of the invention, the DTI is the synthetic thrombin inhibitor ximelagatran. Ximelagatran is metabolized in the liver to its active form, melagatran. Analogous to argatroban, melagatran is a catalytic-site directed thrombin inhibitor, and is the first oral form thrombin inhibitor (in contrast with conventional intravenous drugs including argatroban, bivalirudin, and recombinant form of hirudin). Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, methods are provided for the inhibition of the anticoagulation effect of ximelegatran and/or its metabolite melagatran comprising administration to a patient in need thereof a variant prothrombin or thrombin, particularly thrombin mutants W215A/E217A, W215A, and variants thereof.</p>As described above, the present invention provides a method for inhibiting the anticoagulation effect of a thrombin inhibitor in a patie",

(2001) Thrombosis Research, 101:159-170), but activated plasma products may be associated with prothrombotic complications (Bui et al. (2002) Journal of Thoracic &amp; Cardiovascular Surgery, 124:852-854; Aledort (2004) Journal of Thrombosis &amp; Haemostasis, 2:1700-1708). It is thus rational for antidotes to be non-thrombogenic in nature. The failure of heparinase Ito replace protamine may be due to the generation of low molecular heparin as well as its potential for degrading endothelial glycosaminoglycans. Conversely, the thrombin mutant, W215A/E217A, increases safety margins because intravenous administration of W215A/E217A results in systemic activation of protein C. This is a corollary to the relative safety of rapid reversal of heparin with protamine, which exerts inherent anticoagulant activity (Chu et al. (2001) British Journal of Haematology, 115:392-399) and potentiation of protein C activation (Slungaard and Key (1994) Journal of Biological Chemistry, 269:25549-25556).</p>The concentrations of heparin and DTIs used in the current experiments are within therapeutic ranges of heparin (0.5 U/ml; 3.3 mM), argatroban (0.5-1.0 \u03bcg/ml; 1-2 \u03bcM), bivalirudin (5-10 \u03bcg/ml; 2.3-4.6 \u03bcM), and lepirudin (1 \u03bcg/ml; 0.14 \u03bcM). The molar concentration for W215A/E217A, 5 \u03bcg/ml or 0.14 \u03bcM, was mostly below those of thrombin inhibitors (assuming W215A/E217A as 37 kDa). In addition to the molar ratio, relative difference in Ki values (lepirudin&gt;&gt;bivalirudin&gt;argatroban) toward thrombin may also affect binding to W215A/E217A. It is possible that W215A/E217A restores hemostasis in vivo because of faster onset and sufficient thrombin generation (peak thrombin over 100 nM, FIG. 6D). The in vivo plasma concentration of W215A/E217A may reach 3.75 \u03bcg/ml in the non-human primate model (Gruber et al. (2002) Journal of Biological Chemistry, 277:27581-27584), and higher dosing schemes can be safely used in the presence of anticoagulation with heparin and DTIs.</p>In summary, the present findings demonstrate that variant thrombins and prothrombins with substantially reduced procoagulant activity can be used to recover endogenous thrombin function. Notably, the thrombin mutant W215A/E217A, is available in suitable form for intravenous injection (Gruber et al. (2002) Journal of Biological Chemistry, 277:27581-27584), and additional in vivo studies are underway to confirm its clinical utility.</p>Example 2Titration Assay for Quantitation of DTIs in Plasma or Whole Blood of a PatientAn assay for the quantitation of DTIs in plasma or whole blood of a patient using the thrombin mutant W215A/E217A (WE) is prepared as follows. Predetermined levels of WE are pre-inserted in 6-channel wells as described in Table 2 using a cartridge format based on the Hepcon HMS Plus 6-channel ACT system (Medtronic Perfusion Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.).</p>TABLE 2Sample concentrations of WE for use in DTI titration assayCh1C"
