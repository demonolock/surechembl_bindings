    "ol hydroxyl groups will react with a carboxyl group of either a G or L to form an alkanediol monoester with the carboxyl group of the G or L, the hydroxyl group of the G or L again reacting with a G or L and so on, to form one of the two copolymer segments; the same process takes place with the second alkanediol hydroxyl group yielding the second copolymer segment, the entire process finally providing a polymer with only hydroxyl groups at both ends of the molecular chain. The resultant polymer is neutral and not acidic. A preferred alkanediol initiator or coupling agent is a linear \u03b1,\u03c9-diol. A specific example is 1,6-hexanediol.</p>It has unexpectedly been found that a polymer of the present invention, when incorporated into a controlled release formulation for leuprolide that is emplaced within the tissues of a prostate cancer patient, provides for a surprisingly long-lasting time course of drug release from the formulation. The time period over which sufficient leuprolide is released to maintain chemical castration levels of serum testosterone (0.5 ng/mL) is as long as 120 days or as long as 180 days. This property is highly advantageous from the medical perspective compared to a shorter time period for art polymers, such as 30 days, as it reduces the number of medical procedures a patient must endure in a course of treatment, enhancing patient comfort and convenience and reducing cost.</p>A polymer of the present invention has a weight average molecular weight of about 6 kD to about 200 kD, preferably about 8 kD to about 100 kD, more preferably from about 15 kD to about 45 kD. The composition of each PLG copolymer segment preferably comprises from about a 45/55 weight ratio to about a 99/1 weight ratio of DL-lactide to glycolide. The composition of each PLGA copolymer segment preferably comprises from about a 45/55 weight ratio to about a 99/1 weight ratio of DL-lactate to glycolate. Alternatively, a polymer of the present invention has the same molecular weight ranges, but comprises PL or PLA polymer segments, wherein lactide (or equivalently, lactate) comprises 100% of the polymer segment.</p>The present invention further provides methods for the preparation of the polymers. A method according to the present invention comprises contacting an alkanediol with lactide or with a mixture of lactide and glycolide in the presence of a suitable polymerization catalyst such that the alkanediol serves as an initiation site for the polymerization of the lactide and glycolide units thereon. Thus, in a polymer formed by a method of the invention, the alkanediol becomes a core of a polymer with PL or PLG copolymer segments covalently linked to the alkanediol core and substantially only free hydroxyl group terminal ends. Another method according to the present invention comprises contacting an alkanediol with lactate or a mixture of lactate and glycolate in the presence of a suitable condensation polymerization catalyst such that the alkanediol serves as an initiator or coupling agent for the formation of longer chain PLA or PLGA polymers, again with only h",

The wavy lines signify points of attachment to other radicals, for example hydrogen atoms at the distal ends and the core alkanediol hydroxyl groups at the proximal ends. The number of repeating units n may range from about 20 up to about 185 for each copolymer segment, providing a polymer of a molecular weight of about 6 kD ranging up to about 50 kD in weight.

The proximal ends of the copolymer segments therefore comprise the carboxyl moieties at the opposite end of the lactide or the glycolide repeating unit, which are linked in ester bonds with hydroxyl groups of the core alkanediols. This structural element is an outstanding feature of the present invention, as it results in the lack of titratable carboxylic acid groups in a polymer of the invention, the product being a neutral polyme",

Preferably the reaction is carried out at about 140\u00b0 C., either under vacuum or under an atmosphere of an inert gas such as nitrogen.</p>The weight percent, and thus mole percent, of lactide or glycolide repeating units in the polymer can be varied by altering the weight percentages of the two reactants present in the polymerization reaction mixture. The properties of the polymer can be changed by variations in the ratio of the lactide to the glycolide monomer components, and by the percent of the alkanediol initiator that is present.</p>Specifically, the molecular weight range of the polymer can be controlled by the amount of core alkanediol present in the polymerization reaction. The greater the weight percentage, and thus the greater the mole fraction of the alkanediol in the polymerization reaction mixture, the shorter are the chain lengths of the polymers attached to the alkanediol core due to the decreased availability of lactide or glycolide reagent molecules per initiating hydroxyl group.</p>The ratio of lactide to glycolide in the PLG copolymer segment is within a range of about 45/55 to about 99/1. Preferably, the ratio is within a range of about 70/30 to about 90/10. In a specific example, the ratio is about 75/25. In another specific example the ratio is 85/15.</p>The weight average molecular weight of the polymer can be about 19 to about 30 kD and the polydispersity index about 1.4 to about 1.8. In a specific example, the weight average molecular weight is about 21 kD and the polydispersity index is about 1.5. The inherent viscosity of the polymer determined in chloroform can be about 0.23 to 0.31 dL/gm. In a specific example the inherent viscosity is 0.25 dL/gm. In another specific example the inherent viscosity is 0.27 dL/gm. In a method of manufacture according to the present invention, these variables may be controlled by a person of skill in the art through controlling the relative starting weights of the lactide and the glycolide in the polymerization reactor, the relative amount of the alkanediol initiator, and the identify and relative quantity of the catalyst used, among other factors.</p>Another method for preparing a polymer of the invention comprising PLGA copolymer segments comprises contacting an alkanediol, glycolic acid, lactic acid, and a catalyst, the catalyst being adapted to catalyze condensation of the lactate and the glycolate with the alkanediol. Again, the alkanediol can be a linear \u03b1,\u03c9-diol. A specific example is hexane-1,6-diol. A typical catalyst for the condensation of lactate and glycolate units is an ion exchange resin, a metal oxide such as zinc oxide or antimony oxide, or the reaction is self-catalyzed by lactic acid and/or glycolic acid.</p>Yet another method for preparing a polymer of the invention comprising PLA copolymer segments comprises contacting an alkanediol, lactic acid, and a catalyst, the catalyst being adapted to catalyze condensation of the lactic acid with the alkanediol.
