Further provided are pharmaceutical formulations comprising a GPVI nucleic acid ligand and/or GPVI ligand modulator.</p>A. DEFINITIONSThe term \u201cabout\u201d, as used herein when referring to a measurable value such as an amount of weight, time, dose, etc. is meant to encompass variations of \u00b120% or \u00b110%, \u00b15%, \u00b11%, or \u00b10.1% from the specified amount, as such variations are appropriate to perform the disclosed method.</p>A \u201cnucleic acid ligand,\u201d which may also referred to herein as a \u201cligand\u201d or \u201captamer,\u201d is a nucleic acid that can form a tertiary structure, which allows it to interact with a target molecule. A \u201cGPVI nucleic acid ligand\u201d or \u201cGPVI ligand\u201d or \u201canti-GPVI ligand\u201d of \u201cnucleic acid GPVI ligand\u201d refers to a ligand or aptamer that specifically binds to GPVI. The terms refer to oligonucleotides having specific binding regions that are capable of forming complexes with an intended target molecule in a physiological environment. The affinity of the binding of an ligand to a target molecule is defined in terms of the dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) of the interaction between the ligand and the target molecule. Typically, the K<sub>d </sub>of the ligand for its target is between about 1 nM to about 100 nM. The specificity of the binding is defined in terms of the comparative dissociation constant of the ligand for target as compared to the dissociation constant with respect to the ligand and other materials in the environment or unrelated molecules in general. Typically, the K<sub>d </sub>for the ligand with respect to the target will be 10-fold, 50-fold, 100-fold, or 200-fold less than the K<sub>d </sub>with respect to the unrelated material or accompanying material in the environment.</p>\u201cLigand modulator pair\u201d or \u201cligand modulator pair\u201d is meant to include a specified ligand to a target molecule, and a ligand modulator that changes the secondary and/or tertiary structure of the ligand so that the ligand's interaction with its target is modulated. The modulator can be an oligonucleotide complimentary to a portion of the ligand. The modulator can change the conformation of the ligand to reduce the target binding capacity of the ligand by 10% to 100%, 20% to 100%, 25%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or 100%, or any percentage in the range between 10% and 100% under physiological conditions.</p>\u201cModulator,\u201d \u201cantidote,\u201d \u201cregulator\u201d or \u201ccontrol agent\u201d refer to any pharmaceutically acceptable agent that can bind a ligand or aptamer as described herein and modify the interaction between that ligand and its target molecule (e.g., by modifying the structure of the ligand) in a desired manner.</p>\u201cModulate\u201d as used herein means a lessening, an increase, or some other measurable change in activity.</p>\u201cPharmaceutically acceptable,\u201d as used herein means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government o",
    "ent medication, and other factors that those skilled in the medical arts will recognize. Generally, an amount between 0.1 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg body weight/day of active ingredients is administered dependent upon the potency of the nucleic acid ligand and modulator.</p>A \u201cstabilized nucleic acid molecule\u201d refers to a nucleic acid molecule that is less readily degraded in vivo (e.g., via an exonuclease or endonuclease) in comparison to a non-stabilized nucleic acid molecule. Stabilization can be a function of length and/or secondary structure and/or inclusion of chemical substitutions within the sugar of phosphate portions of the oligonucleotide backbone. Stabilization can be obtained by controlling, for example, secondary structure which can stabilize a molecule. For example, if the 3\u2032 end of a nucleic acid molecule is complementarily to an upstream region, that portion can fold back and form a \u201cstem loop\u201d structure which stabilizes the molecule.</p>The terms \u201cbinding affinity\u201d and \u201cbinding activity\u201d are meant to refer to the tendency of a ligand molecule to bind or not to bind to a target. The energetics of said interactions are significant in \u201cbinding activity\u201d and \u201cbinding affinity\u201d because they define the necessary concentrations of interacting partners, the rates at which these partners are capable of associating, and the relative concentrations of bound and free molecules in a solution. The energetics may be characterized through, among other ways, the determination of a dissociation constant, K<sub>d</sub>.</p>\u201cTreatment\u201d or \u201ctreating\u201d as used herein means any treatment of disease in a mammal, including: (a) protecting against the disease, that is, causing the clinical symptoms not to develop; (b) inhibiting the disease, that is, arresting, ameliorating, reducing, or suppressing the development of clinical symptoms; and/or (c) relieving the disease, that is, causing the regression of clinical symptoms. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that in human medicine, it is not always possible to distinguish between \u201cpreventing\u201d and \u201csuppressing\u201d since the ultimate inductive event or events may be unknown, latent, or the patient is not ascertained until well after the occurrence of the event or events. Therefore, as used herein the term \u201cprophylaxis\u201d is intended as an element of \u201ctreatment\u201d to encompass both \u201cpreventing\u201d and \u201csuppressing\u201d as defined herein. The term \u201cprotection,\u201d as used herein, is meant to include \u201cprophylaxis.\u201d</p>The term \u201ceffective amount\u201d means a dosage sufficient to provide treatment for the disorder or disease state being treated. This will vary depending on the patient, the disease and the treatment being effected.</p>A GPVI nucleic acid ligand \u201cvariant\u201d as used herein encompasses variants that perform essentially the same function as a GPVI nucleic acid ligand and comprises substantially the same structure.</p>B. GLYCOPROTEIN VIGlycoprotein VI (GPVI) is specifically expressed on the surface of platelet cells.",
    "ides a structure analogous to Loop 2 such that the GPVI ligand maintains its structure and function when Loop 2 is substituted with the spacer. Substitution of Loop 2 with a hexaethylene glycol spacer provided by incorporation of (9-O-Dimethoxytrityl-triethylene glycol, 1-[(2-cyanoethyl)-(N,N-diisopropyl)]-phosphoramidite (see FIGS. 13A-13B) into the GPVI nucleic acid ligand resulted in no loss of affinity for GPVI. Accordingly, one having ordinary skill in the art would understand that Loop 2 can be replaced with a variety of non-nucleotide spacers that are commercially available. Examples of such spacers include, but are not limited to those provided by incorporation of, 5\u2032-O-Dimethoxytrityl-1\u20322\u2032Dideoxyribose-3\u2032-[(2-cyanoethyl)-(N,N-diisopropyl)]-phosphoramidite; 18-O-Dimethoxytritylhexaethyleneglycol, 1-[(2-cyanoethyl)-(N,N-diisopropyl)]-phosphoramidite; and 12-(4,4\u2032-Dimethoxytrityloxy)dodecyl-1-[(2-cyanoethyl)-(N,N-diisopropyl)]-phosphoramidite into the GPVI nucleic acid ligand.</p>Efficacy of a GPVI ligand in regulating GPVI function or treating platelet-mediated disease depends largely upon the ability of the ligand to bind with sufficient affinity to the GPVI protein. Accordingly, after obtaining GPVI ligands through the SELEX process, each ligand is sequenced, and then may be characterized in terms of binding to the target molecule. The binding affinity of the ligands herein with respect to the target (GPVI) can be defined in terms of K<sub>d</sub>. The value of this dissociation constant can be determined directly by well-known methods, such as by radioligand binding methods described in Example 1. It has been observed, however, that for some small oligonucleotides, direct determination of K<sub>d </sub>is sometimes difficult, and can lead to misleadingly high results. Under these circumstances, a competitive binding assay for the target molecule or other candidate substance can be conducted with respect to substances known to bind the target or candidate. The value of the concentration at which 50% inhibition occurs (K<sub>i</sub>) is, under ideal conditions, equivalent to K<sub>d</sub>. However, in no event will a K<sub>i </sub>be less than K<sub>d</sub>. Thus, determination of K<sub>i</sub>, in the alternative, sets a maximal value for the value of K<sub>d</sub>. Under those circumstances where technical difficulties preclude accurate measurement of K<sub>d</sub>, measurement of K<sub>i </sub>can conveniently be substituted to provide an upper limit for K<sub>d</sub>. A K<sub>i </sub>value can also be used to confirm that an ligand of the present binds a target. In characterizing GPVI ligand binding properties, specificity may be analyzed using competition binding or functional assays with known GPVI binding molecules such as collagen, CRP (collagen related peptide), or convulxin (Cvx).</p>In some embodiments, the K<sub>d </sub>of binding of the ligand to GPVI can range from between about 1 nM to about 100 nM, from about 10 nM to about 50 nM or from about 20 nM to about 0.1 nM. In other embodiments, the K<sub>d </sub>of binding of a ligand to GPVI is at least 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, 5-fold or 10-fold less than the K<sub>d </sub>of binding of the ligand to an unrelated protein or other accompanying material in the environment. The unrelated protein could also be a protein having",
