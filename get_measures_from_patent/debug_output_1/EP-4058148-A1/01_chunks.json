    "es, conformational epitopes and linear epitopes, based on their structure and interaction with the paratope. A conformational epitope is composed of discontinuous sections of the antigen's amino acid sequence. These epitopes interact with the paratope based on the three-dimensional surface features and shape or tertiary structure (folding) of the antigen. Methods of determining the conformation of epitopes include, but are not limited to, x-ray crystallography, two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2D-NMR) spectroscopy and site-directed spin labelling and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. By contrast, linear epitopes interact with the paratope based on their primary structure. A linear epitope is formed by a continuous sequence of amino acids from the antigen and typically includes at least 3 or at least 4, and more usually, at least 5 or at least 6 or at least 7, for example, about 8 to about 10 amino acids in a unique sequence. \n\nThe interaction between the binding domain and the epitope of the target antigen implies that a binding domain exhibits appreciable or significant affinity for the epitope / the target antigen (here: BCMA and CD3, respectively). In general, it does furthermore not exhibit significant affinity for proteins or antigens other than the target antigen (here: BCMA / CD3) - notwithstanding the above discussed cross-reactivity with homologous targets e.g. from other species. \u201cSignificant affinity\u201d includes binding with an affinity (dissociation constant, KD) of &lt;10<sup>6</sup> M. Preferably, binding is considered specific when the binding affinity is &lt;10<sup>7</sup> M, &lt;10<sup>8</sup> M, &lt;10<sup>9</sup> M, &lt;10<sup>10</sup> M, or even &lt;10 <sup>n</sup> M, or &lt;10<sup>12</sup> M. Whether a binding domain (immuno-)specifically reacts with or binds to a target can be tested readily e.g. by comparing the affinity of said binding domain to its desired target protein or antigen with the affinity of said binding domain to non-target proteins or antigens (here: proteins other than BCMA or CD3, respectively). Preferably, an antibody construct of the invention does not significantly bind to proteins or antigens other than BCMA or CD3, respectively (i.e., the first domain does not bind to proteins other than BCMA and the second domain does not bind to proteins other than CD3). For example, it is envisaged that the antibody construct of the invention (and more specifically its first domain) does not significantly bind to, interact with, recognize or cross-react with human BAFF-R and/or human TACI. </p>The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of an antibody construct of the invention to BCMA can be determined by Scatchard or by biacore analysis, as described e.g. in WO 2013/072406. The KD values for CD3 can e.g. be determined by surface plasmon resonance analysis, as described e.g. in WO 2013/072406. It is envisaged that the antibody construct of the present invention has a KD value for BCMA and/or for CD3 in the 2-digit or 1 -digit nanomolar range or in the three digit or even two digit picomolar range. </p>The term \u201cdoes not significantly bind\u201d means that an antibody construct or binding domain of the present invention does not bind a protein or antigen other than BCMA or CD3, i.e., shows reactivity of &lt;30%, preferably &lt;20%, more preferably &lt;10%, particularly preferably &lt;9%, 8%, 7%, 6% or 5% with proteins or antigens other than BCMA or CD3, whereby binding to BCMA or CD3, respectively, is set to be 100%. </p>According to one embodiment of the antibody construct of the present invention, the first and/or the second domain are in the format of an scFv (single-chain variable fragment ). An scFv is not actually a fragment of an antibody, but instead is a fusion protein of the variable regions of the heavy (VH) and light chains (VL) of immunoglobulins, connected with a short linker peptide. The linker is usually rich in glycine for flexibility, as well as serine or threonine for solubility. The scFv is designed to retain the specificity of the original immunoglobulin, despite removal of the constant regions and the introduction of the linker. In an scFv, the VH region and the and VL region are arranged in the order VH-VL or VL- VH (from N- to C-terminus). It is envisaged that the VH and the VL regions of the first and/or the second \n\nbinding domain are connected via a linker, preferably a peptide linker. According to one embodiment of t"
