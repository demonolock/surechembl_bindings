    "), Fc-soluble Tie2 receptor fusion (i.e., a \u201cTie2 trap\u201d), or small molecule Ang2 inhibitor.</p>The term \u201cantibody\u201d includes reference to isolated forms of both glycosylated and non-glycosylated immunoglobulins of any isotype or subclass, including any combination of: 1) human (e.g., CDR-grafted), humanized, and chimeric antibodies; and 2) monospecific or multi-specific antibodies, monoclonal, polyclonal, or single chain (scFv) antibodies, irrespective of whether such antibodies are produced, in whole or in part, via immunization, through recombinant technology, by way of in vitro synthetic means, or otherwise. Thus, the term \u201cantibody\u201d is inclusive of those that are prepared, expressed, created or isolated by recombinant means, such as (a) antibodies isolated from an animal (e.g., a mouse) that is transgenic for human immunoglobulin genes or a hybridoma prepared therefrom; (b) antibodies isolated from a host cell transfected to express the antibody (e.g., from a transfectoma); (c) antibodies isolated from a recombinant, combinatorial antibody library; and (d) antibodies prepared, expressed, created or isolated by any other means that involve splicing of immunoglobulin gene sequences to other DNA sequences. In some embodiments the antibodies of the present invention are monoclonal antibodies, such as humanized or fully-human monoclonal antibodies. Typically, antibodies of the present invention will be IgG1 or IgG2 subclass antibodies. The antibody may bind Ang2 or Tie2 with a Kd of less than about 10 nM, 5 nM, 1 nM, or 500 pM.</p>The terms \u201cderivation\u201d or \u201cderivative(s)\u201d generally refer to modification of an Ang2 or Tie2 inhibitor (e.g., 2XCon4(C)), or of a taxane (e.g., paclitaxel or docetaxel), by covalently linking it, directly or indirectly, so as to modify characteristics such as half-life, bioavailability, immunogenicity, solubility, or hypersensitivity, while retaining its therapeutic benefit. Derivatives can be made by, e.g., glycosylation, pegylation, and lipidation, or by protein conjugation of an Ang2 inhibitor, Tie2 inhibitor, or a taxane and are within the scope of the present invention. Exemplary derivitizing agents include an Fc domain as well as a linear polymer (e.g., polyethylene glycol (PEG), polylysine, dextran, etc.); a branched-chain polymer (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,289,872; 5,229,490; and WO 93/21259\u2014all of which are incorporated by reference); a lipid or liposome; a cholesterol group (such as a steroid); a carbohydrate or an oligosaccharide.</p>The terms \u201ceffective amount\u201d or \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d when used in relation to an Ang2 or Tie2 inhibitor (e.g., 2XCon4(C)) refer to an amount that, when used in a combination therapy with a taxane (e.g., paclitaxel, docetaxel, or derivatives thereof): (a) inhibits ovarian cancer progression in a population of ovarian cancer patients with ascites; and/or (b) increases the length of time for progression-free survival (PFS) of a patient with ovarian cancer and ascites.<"
