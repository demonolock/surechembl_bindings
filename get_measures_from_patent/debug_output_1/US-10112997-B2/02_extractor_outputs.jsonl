{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that contain all four required components: a specific molecule name, ID or other identifier, a bioactivity metric, a specific numeric value for that metric, and a unit for that value. The text primarily describes methods and techniques for determining binding affinity and does not provide specific numeric values with units for bioactivity metrics."}
{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that meet the specified criteria. The text does not contain specific molecule names, bioactivity metrics, numeric values, and units that are required to be extracted. The text primarily describes the effects of TIGIT-binding agents and methods for evaluating their activity, but it does not provide specific data that includes all four required components."}
