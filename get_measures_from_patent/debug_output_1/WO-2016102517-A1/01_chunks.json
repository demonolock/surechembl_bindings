    " the art. The action of the inhibitor can be examined by measuring the ubiquitine ligase activity of Rad18 in the presence or absence of an inhibitor. This can be achieved in vitro by testing the ability of Rad18 to catalyze the transfer of an ubiquitin monomer onto the substrate PCNA as described in Watanabe et al., 2004, or in vivo to induce formation of Y-family translesion DNA polymerases (eta, kappa, iota, revl ) foci upon treatment with DNA damaging agents, such as MMS or cisplatin, as described in Kannouche et al., 2004, or to induce formation of 53BP1 foci upon induction of double strand breaks with ionizing radiations or radiomimetic agents, such as doxorubicin, as described in Huang et al., 2009. </p> Therefore the inhibitor of Rad18 activity is preferably an inhibitor of the ubiquitine ligase activity of Rad18. </p> In a particular embodiment, the inhibitor of Rad18 activity is a small molecule, ie a chemically synthesized compound (which is not a polymer, therefore excluding nucleic acids and polypeptides) that is capable of interfering with Rad18 activity. </p> In another embodiment, the inhibitor of Rad18 activity is an anti-Rad18 antibody. The term \"anti-Rad18 antibody\" refers to an antibody that binds to Rad18 protein, and blocks its activity. Anti-Rad18 neutralizing antibody. Specific antibodies are preferred, i.e. antibodies that show substantially no cross-reaction with any other entity. Preferably the antibody binds Rad18 with a high affinity, e.g. with a Kd of less than about 10<sup>\"9</sup>. </p> The term \"antibody\", as used herein, is intended to refer broadly to any immunologic binding agent such as IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE, and human, humanized or chimeric antibody. In certain embodiments, IgG and/or IgM are preferred because they are the most common antibodies in the physiological situation and they are most easily manufactured. The term \"antibody\" is used to refer to any antibody-like molecule that has an antigen binding region, and includes antibody fragments such as Fab', Fab, F(ab') 2, single domain antibodies (DABs), Fv, scFv (single chain Fv), and the like. The techniques for preparing and using various antibody-based constructs and fragments are well known in the art. Means for preparing and characterizing antibodies are also well known in the art. A \"humanized\" antibody is an antibody in which the constant and variable framework region of one or more human immunoglobulins is fused with the binding region, e.g. the CDR, of an animal immunoglobulin. \"Humanized\" antibodies contemplated in the present invention are chimeric antibodies from mouse, rat, or other species, bearing human constant and/or variable region domains, bispecific antibodies, recombinant and engineered antibodies and fragments thereof. Such humanized antibodies are designed to maintain the binding specificity of the non-human antibody from which the binding regions are derived, but to avoid an immune reaction against the non-human antibody.
