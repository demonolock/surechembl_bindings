    "The invention relates to a stable virus-safe factor VIII complex which in particular contains high molecular weight vWF multimers with high structural integrity. Furthermore, the invention relates to methods for obtaining and producing a stable factor VIII complex and pharmaceutical preparations thereof.</p>Blood clotting is a complex process involving the sequential interaction of a number of components, particularly fibrinogen, Factor II, Factor V, Factor VII, Factor VIII, Factor IX, Factor X, Factor XI and Factor XII. The loss of one of these components or the inhibition of their functionality results in an increased tendency to coagulate, which can be life-threatening in some patients.</p>Von Willebrand Factor (vWF) circulates in plasma complexed with Factor VIII, with Factor VIII supporting blood coagulation and vWF in complex with Factor VIII stabilizing it and protecting it from proteolytic degradation. Due to its function in platelet aggregation, vWF also interferes directly with blood clotting. The vWF is a glycoprotein that is produced in various mammalian cells and subsequently released into the circulation. In this case, a vWF dimer having a molecular weight of 550 kD is formed in the cells starting from a polypeptide chain having a molecular weight of about 220 kD by formation of a plurality of sulfur bridges. From the vWF dimers, further polymers of the vWF of ever higher molecular weight, up to 20 million daltons, are then prepared by linking. vWF therefore exists in plasma in a series of multimeric forms of molecular weight from 1 x 10 <sup>6</sup> to 20 x 10 <sup>6</sup> daltons. It is believed that especially the high molecular weight vWF multimers play an essential role in blood clotting.</p>In addition to the carrier function for coagulation factor VIII, the function of the vWF is the formation of bridges between the vessel wall and the platelets and platelet agglutination. The basis for platelet agglutination is given by the binding of vWF to surface receptors (glycoproteins Ib, IIb / IIIa). The binding site within the vWF for binding to GP Ib is in the disulfide loop Cys (509) -Cys (695). It is known that platelet agglutination begins with binding of vWF to glycoprotein Ib. After an activation signal, the vWF binds to the glycoprotein IIb / IIIa complex and agglutinates. Platelet agglutination thus requires the binding of the vWF to the surface receptors; the binding of multiple platelets by a vWF molecule leads to agglutination. vWF platelet binding thus represents the molecular cause of platelet agglutination.</p>In hemophilia, blood clotting is disturbed by lack of certain plasma coagulation factors. In hemophilia A, the tendency to bleed is due to a deficiency of factor VIII or a deficiency of vWF, which is an integral "
