    " one or more polyomavirus capsid polypeptides or fragments thereof, and additional pharmaceutical agents.</p>In general, the nature of the carrier will depend on the particular mode of administration being employed. For instance, parenteral formulations usually comprise injectable fluids that include pharmaceutically and physiologically acceptable fluids such as water, physiological saline, balanced salt solutions, aqueous dextrose, glycerol or the like as a vehicle. For solid compositions (for example, powder, pill, tablet, or capsule forms), conventional non-toxic solid carriers can include, for example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, or magnesium stearate. In addition to biologically-neutral carriers, pharmaceutical compositions to be administered can contain minor amounts of non-toxic auxiliary substances, such as wetting or emulsifying agents, preservatives, and pH buffering agents and the like, for example sodium acetate or sorbitan monolaurate.</p>Polyomavirus: A genus of nonenveloped viruses having an icosahedral capsid. The genome of polyomaviruses includes non-structural proteins (large T-antigen and small t-antigen), a non-coding region including an origin of replication and promoters, and structural proteins (VP1, VP2, and VP3). Polyomaviruses include but are not limited to BK polyomavirus, JC polyomavirus, Merkel cell polyomavirus, and simian virus 40 (SV40). Related human polyomaviruses WU virus (Gaynor et al., PLoS Pathog. 3:e64, 2007) and KI virus (Allander et al., J. Virol. 81:4130-4136, 2007) have recently been reported in clinical samples</p>Polyomavirus infection is generally asymptomatic in healthy subjects. However, polyomavirus infection can occur or be reactivated in immunocompromised individuals and can cause significant morbidity.</p>Polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (PVAN; also called BK polyomavirus-associated nephropathy or BK virus nephritis) occurs in up to 10% of renal transplant recipients and is believed to be caused by BKV infection or reactivation of latent BKV infection. It causes kidney allograft dysfunction and may lead to loss of the allograft. Polyomavirus-associated hemorrhagic cystitis is characterized by inflammation of the bladder leading to dysuria, hematuria, and hemorrhage. It can occur in bone marrow transplant recipients and other individuals who are receiving immunosuppressants or other therapies which decrease immune system function.</p>Sequence identity: The similarity between two nucleic acid sequences, or two amino acid sequences, is expressed in terms of the similarity between the sequences, otherwise referred to as sequence identity. Sequence identity is frequently measured in terms of percentage identity (or similarity or homology); the higher the percentage, the more similar the two sequences are.</p>Methods of alignment of sequences for comparison are well known in the art. Various programs and alignment algorithms are described in: Smith &amp; Waterman, Adv. Appl."
