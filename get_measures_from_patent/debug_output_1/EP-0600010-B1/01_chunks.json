    "binding autoradiographs were performed as described in Example 1. Low to high binding \nintensities are shown in OD units. The arrow in A points to the regions of atria. See Figure\n4E for histology.\n      Figure 2 shows the displacement of the binding of <sup>32</sup>P-relaxin by unlabeled relaxin in\nthe rat uterus (A), the atria of female rat heart (B), and the atria of estrogen-treated\novariectomized rat (C). Consecutive tissue sections were incubated with 100 M <sup>32</sup>P-relaxin\nin the absence (Bo) and presence (B) of increasing concentrations of unlabeled relaxin.\nBinding intensities were analyzed by computerized densitometry and expressed as OD units\nor radioactivity (cpm). In detail, a square of uniform predetermined size (9 mm<sup>2</sup> on the RAS-3000\nscreen) was placed on the areas of maximum binding in each particular region. The OD\nor cpm represents the integrated intensity within that particular square, based on parallel <sup>32</sup>P-relaxin\nstandards ranging from 50-2000 cpm. Background binding was subtracted from all\nreadings. Binding intensities corresponding to an OD of 0.05 were readily detected and\nresolved from background binding. Each point represents the mean of the five highest\nbinding areas within each region. The two curves in each panel represent determinations on\ntwo separate regions on each tissue: in A. \u25b4 uterine horn, \u25a1 cervix; in B and C \u0394, \u25b4 right\natrium, \u25a1 left atrium. The displacement data were fit to a four-parameter equation and the\ndissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) for relaxin was calculated to be 1.3 \u00b1 0.22 nM in A; 1.37 \u00b1 0.13\nnM in B; and 0.86 \u00b1 0.35 nM in C.\n      Figure 3 shows the displacement of the binding of <sup>32</sup>P-H2 relaxin by unlabeled H1\nrelaxin in the atria of female rat heart. \u25a1 left atrium; \u25b4 right atrium.\n      Figure 4 shows the binding of 100 pM <sup>32</sup>P-relaxin in the atria of A. ovariectomized\nfemale rat; B. ovariectomized female rat treated with estrogen; C. normal cycling female rat;\nand D. normal female treated with estrogen. The enhanced spectrum is shown in D. E. is a\nportion of an hematoxylin-eosin stained female rat heart section which corresponds to the\nregion marked by \u2194 in C.

    "tissue\nsections were then covered with 600-700 \u00b5l of 100 pM <sup>32</sup>P-relaxin with or without excess\nunlabeled relaxin and other competing agents as specificity control, and incubated at 4\u00b0C for\none hour. The slides were washed 3 times for 15-30 minutes each, with binding buffer. The\nslides were air-dried and mounted on filter paper and exposed to Hyperfilm-\u03b2<sub>Max</sub> (Amersham)\nfor 3-5 days.</p>\n  Regions of binding were determined by overlaying the autoradiographs with adjacent\nsections counterstained with hematoxylin-eosin. For relaxin binding displacement\nexperiments, consecutive 16 \u00b5m sections were incubated with 100 pM of <sup>32</sup>P-relaxin in the\nabsence and presence of increasing concentrations (serial three-fold increases) of unlabeled\nrelaxin in the range of 0.1-100 nM. Pseudocolor reconstruction and quantitative analysis of\n<sup>32</sup>P-relaxin binding autoradiographs were performed with a RAS-3000 image analysis system \n(Amersham). The OD or radioactivities (cpm) of bound <sup>32</sup>P relaxin (maximum binding in a\nparticular region) were quantified by computerized densitometry based on parallel sets of <sup>32</sup>P-relaxin\nstandards (ranging from 50 to 2000 cpm) blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes\n(Trans-Blot SF, Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). The binding inhibition data were fit to a four\nparameter equation to obtain the ED<sub>50</sub> (the concentration of unlabeled relaxin yielding 50%\ndisplacement of the binding of <sup>32</sup>P-relaxin). The dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) for relaxin was\ncalculated by the method of Cheng and Prusoff [Biochem. Pharmacol. 22, 3099-3108\n(1973)].</p>\n  \n    Results\n  \n  Relaxin Binding Sites in the Rat Heart Nine different rat tissues, including the liver,\nspleen, thymus, kidney, adrenal gland, heart, lung, skin, and testis, were examined in the\npresent studies for the binding of <sup>32</sup>P-relaxin. Of all these tissues the only one which showed\nbinding was the (normal female) rat heart (Fig. 1A). The binding was seen in the atria but not\nthe ventricles. The specificity of binding was demonstrated by the displacement of the\nbinding of 100 pM <sup>32</sup>P-relaxin by 100 nM unlabeled relaxin (Fig. 1B) but not by 100 nM IGF-I\n(Genentech, Inc.) (Fig. 1C), insulin (Eli Lilly, Pearl River, N.Y.), angiotensin II, and atrial\nnatriuretic peptide (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) (data not shown). Similar binding in the atria of\nnormal male rat heart (Fig. 1D) can also be fully displaced by 100 nM unlabeled relaxin (data\nnot shown).</p>\n  Affinity of Relaxin Binding to Rat Heart and Rat Uterus Measurements of the inhibition\nof <sup>32</sup>P-relaxin binding in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled relaxin yield\na displacement curve consistent with a single class of relaxin binding sites in the rat uterus\n(Fig. 2A) and heart (Fig. 2B and 2C). While total displacement was achieved in the heart (Fig.\n2B and 2C), partial displacement was observed in the uterus (Fig. 2A). The dissociation\nconstant (K<sub>d</sub>) for relaxin was calculated as the mean \u00b1 S.E. of two separate regions on the\nsame tissue: 1.3 \u00b1 0.22 nM in the uterus (Fig. 2A), and 1.37 \u00b1 0.13 nM in the normal heart\n(Fig. 2B), and 0.86 \u00b1 0.35 nM in the estrogen-treated ovariectomized rat heart (Fig. 2C).</p>\n  Analogous displacement curve was obtained with H1 relaxin in the atrium of female\nrat heart (Fig. 3). The dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) for H1 relaxin was found to be 1.53 \u00b1 0.04\nnM.</p>\n  Effect of Steroid Hormones on Relaxin Receptors in the Rat Heart. Ovariectomy did\nnot change the <sup>32</sup>P-relaxin binding in the female rat heart (Figures 4A and B). Likewise,\ncastrated male rat hearts showed the same relaxin binding as intact male rat hearts (data not\nshown). Estrogen treatment of normal or ovariectomized female rats had no effect on relaxin\nbinding in the heart (Figures 4C and 4D). Likewise, testosterone treatment of intact or\ncastrated male rats, or estrogen primed castrated male rats, did not cause any changes in\nrelaxin binding in the heart (data not shown). The above data were repeated in a separate\nset of experiments using different tissue sections. The affinity of relaxin binding to the atria \nin estrogen-treated ovariectomized rats (K<sub>d</sub>=0.86 \u00b1 0.35 nM, Fig. 2C) is not significantly\ndifferent from that in intact female atria (1.37 \u00b1 0.13 nM, Figure 2B).</p>\n  Earlier reports on the specific binding of a <sup>32</sup>P-labeled H2 relaxin to the rat uterus and\nbrain [Osheroff, P.L., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 265, 9396-9401 (1990); and Proc. Natl. Acad.\nSci. USA, 88, 6413-6417 (1991)] suggested that, in addition to its roles in pregnancy, relaxin\nmight have other physiological roles as well.</p>\n  In this study the binding of relaxin to various other rat tissues was examined, and it\nwas surprisingly found that the heart was the only tissue among these "
