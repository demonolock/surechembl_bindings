    "og is said to have \"binding selectivity\" if it has higher binding affinity for one receptor compared to the other receptor; e.g. a cannabinoid analog which has an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.1 nM for CB1 and 1 0 nM for CB2, is 1 00 times more selective for the CB1 receptor. The binding affinities (K,) are expressed in nanomoles (nM) and are listed in TABLE 1 and TABLE 2 above. For the CB1 receptor binding studies, membranes were prepared from rat forebrain membranes according to the procedure of P.R. Dodd et al, A Rapid Method for Preparing Synaptosomes: Comparison with Alternative Procedures, Brain Res., 1 07 - 1 1 8 (1 981 ). The binding of the novel analogues to the CB1 cannabinoid receptor was assessed as described in W.A. Devane et al, Determination and Characterization of a Cannabinoid Receptor in a Rat Brain,</p>\n  Mol. Pharmacol., 34, 605 - 61 3 (1 988) and A. Charalambous et al, 5'-azido A<sup>8</sup> -THC: A Novel Photoaffinity Label for the Cannabinoid Receptor, J. Med. Chem., \n\n35, 3076 - 3079 ( 1 992) with the following changes. The above articles are incorporated by reference herein.</p>\n  Membranes, previously frozen at -80\u00b0C, were thawed on ice. To the stirred suspension was added three volumes of TME (25mM Tris-HCI buffer, 5 mM MgCI<sub>2</sub> and 1 mM EDTA) at a pH 7.4. The suspension was incubated at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. At the end of the incubation, the membranes were pelleted and washed three times with TME.</p>\n  The treated membranes were subsequently used in the binding assay described below. Approximately 30 \u03bcg of membranes were incubated in silanized 96-well microtiter plate with TME containing 0.1 % essentially fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.8 nM [<sup>3</sup>H] CP-55,940, and various concentrations of test materials at 200 \u00b0C for 1 hour. The samples were filtered using Packard Filtermate 1 96 and Whatman GF/C filterplates and washed with wash buffer (TME) containing 0.5% BSA. Radioactivity was detected using MicroScint 20 scintillation cocktail added directly to the dried filterplates, and the filterplates were counted using a Packard Instruments Top-Count. Nonspecific binding was assessed using 1 00 nM CP-55,940. Data collected from three independent experiments performed with duplicate determinations was normalized between 100% and 0% specific binding for [<sup>3</sup>H] CP-55,940, determined using buffer and 1 00 nM CP-55,940. The normalized data was analyzed using a 4-parameter nonlinear logistic equation to yield IC<sub>50</sub> values. Data from at least two independent experiments performed in duplicate was used to calculate IC<sub>50</sub> values which were converted to K, values using the assumptions of Cheng et al, Relationship Between the Inhibition Constant (K,) and the \n<img id=\"imgf000016_0001\" path=\"imgf000016_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/2002916/WO/20010426/A1/002001/02/85/57/imgf000016_0001.tif\"/>\n</p>\n  Reaction, Biochem.

Silanized centrifuge tubes were used throughout to minimize receptor loss due to adsorption. The CB2 binding assay was conducted in the same manner as for the CB1 binding assay. The binding affinities (K,) were also expressed in nanomoles (nM) .
