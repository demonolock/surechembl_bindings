    "nd Dimebon in three functional examinations.Test is wherein compared with antihistamine drug the activity of two kinds of chemical compounds of in vivo test announcement of the neurogenetic effect of Hippocampus, and the level of performance of embodiment 45 compounds show is high 10 to 30 times, high about 40% (Figure 22 b) of the highest effect.Previous existing report, Dimebon protection cortical neuron exempts from A \u03b2\n        \n        <sub>(25-35)</sub>Toxicity people such as (, 2001) Bachurin of-mediation.Shown in Figure 22 C, Dimebon only provides protective effect when the dosage of 3 \u03bc M.Embodiment 45 chemical compounds are not lost neuroprotective activity, even when being diluted to low nanomole level.Dimebon is participation protective mitochondrion (people such as Bachurin, 2003) also.Therefore, we compare Dimebon and embodiment 45 chemical compounds in the inductive mitochondrion resolution measurement of calcium.Observe two kinds of chemical compounds and have activity, and the relative efficiency of observing embodiment 45 chemical compounds is superior to Dimebon (Figure 22 D).Infiltrative protective effect disappears embodiment 45 chemical compounds between 10 to the 1nM dosage to mitochondrial membrane, and the protective effect of the Dimebon between 10 to the 1 \u03bc M disappears.\n      \n      </p>Test implementation example 45 chemical compounds and Dimebon combine with the H1 histamine receptor.Although Dimebon shows and this receptor is had high-affinity (IC50\uff1c100nM), two kinds of enantiomer of embodiment 45 chemical compounds show low H1 affinity (IC50\uff1e10 \u03bc M).</p>Other embodiment</p>The application requires U.S. Provisional Application No.61/143,755 interests, and the full content of this application is incorporated this paper by reference into.U.S. Provisional Application No.61/143,755 disclosure includes but not limited to:</p>Be used for promoting the patient who is determined needs the method for mammalian nervous trophism in puerperal, said method uses the neurotrophic carbazole compound of the formula 1 of effective dose for said patient</p></p>Wherein:</p>R\n        \n        <sub>1</sub>-R\n        \n        <sub>8</sub>Each independent naturally hydrogen of selecting, hetero atom, heteroatom functional group and optional substituted, optional hetero atom substituted rudimentary (C1-C6) alkyl;\n      \n      </p>R\n        \n        <sub>9</sub>Be hydrogen or optional substituted, optional hetero atom substituted rudimentary (C1-C6) alkyl; And\n      \n      </p>R\n        \n        <sub>10</sub>And R\n        \n        <sub>11</sub>Each independent naturally hydrogen of selecting; Optional substituted, the optional substituted C1-C6 alkyl of hetero atom; Optional substituted, the optional substituted C2-C6 thiazolinyl of hetero atom; Optional substituted, optional substituted C2-C6 alkynyl of hetero atom and optional substituted, the optional substituted C6-C14 aryl of hetero atom comprise tautomer, stereoisomer and its officinal salt.\n      \n      </p>Except as otherwise noted, all structures as herein described comprise "
