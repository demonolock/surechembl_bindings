In an even more preferred embodiment, the arginase is derived by expression of a polynucleotide derived from a mammalian neuron or glial cell.</p>The term \u201carginase activity\u201d refers to an enzymatic activity of an arginase, or a mutein, homologous protein, analog, derivative, fusion or fragment thereof; that catalyzes the conversion of arginine (arg) to ornithine. Arginase enzymatic assays are well known to those of skill in the art. In a preferred embodiment, a characteristic of arginase activity, e.g., association and dissociation constants, catalytic rates and substrate turnover rates, is the same as that characteristic possessed by the arginase expressed from the human ArgI liver polynucleotide sequence (GenBank Accession No. NM 000045 and references cited therein). In another preferred embodiment, the arginase activity is different from that of an arginase expressed from the human ArgI liver polynucleotide sequence (GenBank Accession No. NM 000045 and references cited therein). An arginase activity that is different may be one, e.g., that has an increase or decrease in catalytic activity or that has a different association and/or dissociation constant compared to that of an arginase expressed from the human ArgI liver polynucleotide sequence (GenBank Accession No. NM 000045 and references cited therein).</p>An agent which alters or modulates the arginase \u201cactivity\u201d, \u201cbioactivity\u201d or \u201cbiological activity\u201d in a neuron refers to an agent which can directly or ultimately increase (agonist) or decrease (antagonist) arginase enzymatic activity (the conversion of arginine to ornithine), or the immediately measurable results of such activity (e.g., increased ornithine and derivative polyamine synthesis) in a neuron. Arginase activity may be modulated by altering levels of DNA, RNA or protein encoding arginase or an arginase modulatory agent in a neuron. Arginase activity may also be modulated by mutation or alteration of an arginase polynucleotide or polypeptide molecule directly. Such mutations or alterations include, but are not limited to, those which alter a substrate affinity constant or binding rate, a substrate dissociation rate, the catalytic or turnover rate of the enzyme, and the binding constant of an arginase subunit to another homologous or heterologous subunit or molecule which affects (increases or decreases) catalysis by the arginase molecule. Arginase activity in a neuron may also be modulated by association (covalent or non-covalent) with another agent or factor.</p>Arginase activity may be measured directly by arginase specific enzymatic assays (infra) or indirectly by assaying arginase encoding nucleic acid levels in a cell (e.g., by RT-PCR, Northern blot analysis or other methods for measuring levels of steady-state RNA encoding arginase), or arginase specific protein molecules in a cell (e.g., by a variety of immunoaffinity procedures, including Western blot techniques, ELISA assays and the like)\u2014all of which are techniques that are well-known to those of skill in the art and which are described herein.</p>The arginase activity to be modulated according to the invention may be expressed from a wild-type (endogenous or exogenous) polynucleotide or polypeptide encoding arginase. The activity may also be expressed from a modified polynucleotide or protein encoding arginase, including but not limited to muteins, analogs, fusions or fragments thereof having arginase biological activity in a neuron.</p>The terms \u201caxonal growth\u201d or \u201caxonal regeneration\u201d as used herein refer both to the ability of an axon to grow and to the ability of an axon to sprout. An axon sprout is defined as a new process that extends from an existing or growing axon (See, "
