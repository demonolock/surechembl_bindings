    "ctional antibodies\" refer to antibodies that are capable of inhibiting the interaction between Norovirus particles and red blood cell antigens. In other words, functional antibody titer is equivalent to histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) or carbohydrate blocking antibody titer. The serum titer of Norovirus-specific functional antibodies can be measured by the HAI assay described above. The serum titer of Norovirus-specific functional antibodies can also be measured using an ELISA-based assay in which a carbohydrate H antigen is bound to microtiter wells and Norovirus VLP binding to H antigen is detected in the presence of serum (see Example 1 and Reeck et al. (2010) J Infect Dis, Vol. 202(8):1212-1218). An increase in the level of Norovirus-specific functional antibodies can be an indicator of a protective immune response. Thus, in one embodiment, the administration of the vaccine elicits a protective immunity comprising an increase in the serum titer of Norovirus-specific functional antibodies as compared to the serum titer in a human not receiving the vaccine. The serum titer of Norovirus-specific functional antibodies indicative of a protective immune response is preferably a geometric mean titer greater than 40, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200 as measured by the HAI assay or blocking titer (BT)<sub>50</sub> (50% inhibition of H antigen binding by Norovirus VLPs) geometric mean titer of greater than 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, or 500 as measured by the H antigen binding assay. In one embodiment, the serum titer of Norovirus-specific functional antibodies is a geometric mean titer greater than 40 as measured by the HAI assay. In another embodiment, the serum titer of Norovirus-specific functional antibodies is a geometric mean titer greater than 100 as measured by the HAI assay. In another embodiment, the serum titer of Norovirus-specific functional antibodies is a BT<sub>50</sub> geometric mean titer greater than 100 as measured by the H antigen binding assay. In still another embodiment, the serum titer of Norovirus-specific functional antibodies is a BT<sub>50</sub> geometric mean titer greater than 200 as measured by the H antigen binding assay.</p>In a further aspect, the administration of the vaccine elicits a protective immunity comprising an IgA mucosal immune response and an IgG systemic immune response by administering parenterally (preferably intramuscularly) to the subject no more than a single dose of an antigenic or vaccine composition comprising one or more types of Norovirus antigens and optionally at least one effective adjuvant. The inventors have surprisingly found that parenteral administration of the Norovirus vaccine compositions described herein induces a robust IgA response in addition to a strong IgG response. Typically, strong IgA responses are only observed when vaccines are administered through a mucosal route of administration.</p>In certain embodiments, the administration of the vaccine elicits a protective immunity comprising an increase in the level of IgA Norovirus-specific antibody secreting cells in the blood as compared to the level in a human not receiving the vaccine. In some embodiments, the administration of the vaccine elicits a protective immunity comprising an increase in the level of IgA Norovirus-specific antibody secreting cells in the blood as compared to the level in the human before receiving the vaccine. In one embodiment, the IgA Norovirus-specific antibody secreting cells are CCR10+, CD19+, CD27+, CD62L+, and \u03b14\u03b27+. Antibody secreting cells with this marker profile are capable of homing to both peripheral lymphoid tissue, such as Peyer's patch in the gut,"
