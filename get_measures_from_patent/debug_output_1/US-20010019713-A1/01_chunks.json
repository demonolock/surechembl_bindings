Alternatively, analogs of IL-X could be designed that would bind to IL X receptors without activating those receptors. In yet another example, antibodies to the receptors could be administered. Such antibodies could sterically block the receptors, thereby preventing binding by IL-X. Other methodologies and variations of these methodologies would be apparent to one skilled in the art. </p>[0031] A further method for inhibiting the activity of IL-X involves the administration of antisense DNA that would specifically bind to the DNA that encodes IL-X Such an administration of antisense DNA would block the production of IL-X, thereby reducing or eliminating its biological activity. The antisense DNA can be administered by techniques known in the art, including encapsulation in liposomes. </p>[0032] The administration of IL-X proteins or antibodies to IL-X would be in accordance with standard techniques and formulations useful for administering such proteins and antibodies. In one embodiment, the IL-X proteins or anti-IL-X antibodies may be conjugated to antibodies or receptors. These antibodies or receptors could then direct the IL-X biological activity to a desired location in the body. </p>[0033] As used herein, reference to IL-X refers to the 42 kD protein specifically exemplified herein, as well as fragments, precursors, analogs, or derivatives of that 42 kD protein that retain biological or immunological characteristics associated with the 42 kD protein. </p>[0034] A further aspect of the invention pertains to polynucleotide sequences which encode IL-X proteins. The polynucleotide sequences of the subject invention may be composed of either RNA or DNA Preferably, the polynucleotide sequences are composed of DNA. A full length gene encoding the 42 kD protein and any precursor can be obtained as described herein. Also, a person skilled in the art could readily synthesize DNA sequences encoding IL-X peptides. Specific examples of IL-X peptides are provided herein. The nucleotide sequences encoding the peptides could be used to produce recombinant peptides, or they could be used as probes or as primers for diagnostic and/or analytical PCR procedures. The polynucleotides of the subject invention can also be used as DNA or RNA sizing standards. Methods for obtaining full length genes are described in greater detail below. </p>[0035] As used herein, the term \u201cisolated\u201d refers to obtaining a protein or antibody in a form other than that which occurs in nature. This may be, for example, obtaining IL-X by purifying crude samples, or it could be the recovery of recombinant IL-X from transformed cell lines. In the case of polynucleotide sequences, \u201cisolated\u201d would mean, for example, that the sequence is no longer associated with other DNA sequences with which it would naturally occur. Thus, the claimed polynucleotide sequence may be placed into a plasmid or other vector or transformed or transfected into the genome of a host. In the case of antibodies, \u201cisolated\u201d refers to antibodies which, through the hand of man, have been produced or removed from their natural setting. Thus, isolated antibodies according to the subject invention would include antibodies raised as the result of purposeful administration of IL-X compounds to an ",
    "ying lymphoblastoid cell lines for IL-X sequences. Degenerate oligonucleotide pools or longer (40-50-mers) single sequence \u201cguessmers\u201d with or without inosine substitutions can be synthesized with the help of codon preference tables from the tryptic peptide amino acid sequence data provided herein. This approach is successful in providing IL-X cDNA clones as evidenced by the primary filter screening of a bacteriophage \u03bbgt11 library made from the tamarin cell line, BLCL-100-75, with a degenerate oligonucleotide as described in the examples which follow. Six hybridizing plaques from an initial plating of 10<sup>6 </sup>recombinant phage have been plaque purified. The fidelity of these \u201cpositives\u201d can be evaluated by (1) re-hybridization to another oligonucleotide probe synthesized to compare to protein sequence derived from a different tryptic fragment of IL-X; and (2) identification of nucleotide sequences that code for the IL-X peptide sequences. If a non-human cDNA for IL-X is isolated, it could be used as a probe for obtaining the human clone. </p>[0038] Human EBV-LCL derived cDNA libraries can be commercially made using either the reliable \u03bbgt11 vector or possibly one of the recently developed directional cloning derivatives (e.g., \u03bbDR2, lambdaZAP). The vendor (Clontech, Stratagene) can be supplied with poly(A)<sup>+</sup>RNA extracted by standard procedures known to one skilled in the art from EBV-transformed NAD-20 cells expressing IL-X bioactivity and a demonstrable 42 kD IL-X polypeptide. To verify the presence of IL-X transcripts in these poly(A)<sup>+</sup>RNA samples, one can use reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) with combinations of antisense and sense strand oligonucleotides derived from different IL-X tryptic fragment amino acid sequence data. The optimal conditions for primer annealing can be assessed using mRNA extracted from both expressing and non-expressing cell lines. Similarly, the best conditions for oligonucleotide probe hybridization can be evaluated using dot-blots and/or Northern blots of the same samples if sufficient RNA is obtained. Ideally, the same samples that test positive for RT-PCR and/or blot hybridization should be used for library construction. The successful generation of a reproducible PCR fragment that itself cross-hybridizes on Southern blots with other <sup>32</sup>P end-labelled oligonucleotides has the added advantage of providing a more specific IL-X probe for library screening than straight degenerate oligonucleotides. </p>[0039] Standard methods can be used to screen the bacteriophage library. Duplicate lifts onto 150 mm nylon membranes (e.g., GeneScreen, Hy-Bond) from 20 plates containing 50,000 plaques each can be used in the initial screening using <sup>32</sup>P-labelled PCR fragments (amplification labelled) or oligonucleotides (kinase 5\u2032 end-labelled). Several rounds of replating and re-hybridization of \u201cpositive\u201d plaques leads to the isolation of bona fide cDNA clones encoding IL-X. </p>[0040",

Following dialysis, concentrated supernatant applied to the column was eluted with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and monitored at an absorbance of 280 nm. Four-mililiter fractions were collected and tested for activity. The B lymphocyte growth stimulatory activity was recovered in fractions 18-20 with an occasional trailing peak at fraction 22. Column fractions were concentrated 10 times and processed on SDS-PAGE gels. Only one band, with an apparent molecular weight of 42 kD, was detectable by silver stain. The molecular weight appeared to be identical in size when electrophoresis was performed under both reducing and nonreducing conditions. </p>[0061] Purification of IL-X by HPLC results in a substantial removal of this protein from concentrated supernatants. Approximately 40% of the growth stimulatory activity in unfractionated supernatants is recovered in the active HPLC fractions. In Table 1, data are presented for one purification of IL-X. Values for specific activity may be inaccurate, as silver stain is imprecise for this purpose.  \nTABLE 1Purification of IL-XProteinStimulatory activitySpecificcontent***Experi-CPM/activitySourceng/\u03bclmental**\u03bcl(activ/ng)Units/mg*NAD-200.041429/100 \u03bcl14.29357.3mediumHPLC0.002\u2009917/12.5 \u03bcl73.4636,680.03.7 \u00d7 10<sup>8</sup>Frac-18NAD-20\n</p>[0062] Although the apparent molecular weight of IL-X, 42 kD, indicates that IL-X is larger than most immunomodulatory molecules, we have in addition demonstrated by functional assay and mRNA analysis that IL-X is not IL-1\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 (mRNA), IL-2 (CTLL2 cells), IL-3 (DA1 cells), IL-4 (monocyte CD23 induction), IL-5 (Western blot using antibody from Genetics Institute), TNF\u03b1 (ELISA, Cistron Biotechology, Inc.), or IL-6 (B9 cells). </p>[0063] The 42 kD IL-X is not found in culture supernatants of macrophage, T lymphocyte, and epithelial cell lineages, whereas supernatants from 4 different EBV-carrying cell lines contain a molecule of the same size as IL-X. </p>EXAMPLE 2 [0064] Molecular Characterization of IL-X </p>[0065] IL-X was purified from concentrated supernatants by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose was stained with Ponceau S and the appropriate band was excised. This band on the nitrocellulose was incubated with PVP-40 and digested with trypsin. At this stage tryptic fragments could be resolved by reverse-phase HPLC. The IL-X used for purification was obtained from an SDS-PAGE gel and selected by molecular weight. As IL-X is the same apparent molecular weight as actin, the most abundant protein in cells, we felt it was necessary to first select tryptic fragments for sequencing which could not contain any possible actin contaminants. Concentrated NAD-20 medium and purified actin were individually separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and digested with trypsin in parallel. The tryptic fragments from IL-X and actin were processed by reverse phase HPLC in an identical manner. A comparison of the peptide maps indicates that there are several tryptic fragments unique to IL-X that are not similar to any tryptic fragments found in actin. Tryptic fragments unique to IL-X were sequenced. Three HPLC fractions containing well-separated fragments were transfer"
