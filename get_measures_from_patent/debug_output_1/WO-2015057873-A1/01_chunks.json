    "ings: -1.9 psi, upstream voltage -500, downstream voltage - 3000, post sample sip 38s). Data was normalized to 0% and 100% inhibition controls and the IC<sub>50</sub> or EC<sub>50</sub> calculated using a 4-parameter fit using GraphPad Prism. </p>Cellular Activity </p> HMC1.2 autophosphorylation assay: 10,000 HMC1.2 cells were incubated in 22 ul culture media (phenol-red free IMDM, no serum) in each well of a 384- well plate and serum starved overnight in a tissue culture incubator (5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 37\u00b0C). A 10-point dose concentration series of compound (25 uM-95.4 pM) were then added to the cells in a volume of 3.1 ul to each well (0.25% DMSO final concentration). After 90 minutes, 6 ul of 5X AlphaLISA Lysis Buffer (Perkin Elmer) supplemented with a protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Cell Signaling Technologies) was added to each well and shaken at 450 rpm for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C. 10 ul of phospho-Y719 c-KIT and total c-KIT antibodies (15nM final concentration, Cell Signaling</p>Technologies) and 50ug/ml AlphaLISA rabbit acceptor beads (Perkin Elmer) were added to each well and shaken at 300 rpm at room temperature for 2 hours. 10 ul of 100 ug/ml streptavidin donor beads (Perkin Elmer) were added to each well, blocked from light with aluminum adhesive and shaken at 300 rpm at room temperature for 2 hours. Fluorescence signal was obtained on Envision (Perkin Elmer) by AlphaScreen 384 well HTS protocol. Data was normalized to 0% and 100% inhibition controls and the IC50 was calculated using Four </p>Parameter Logistic IC50 curve fitting. </p> The Table below shows the activity of compounds in a Mast cell leukemia cell line, HMC 1.2. This cell line contains KIT mutated at positions V560G and D816V resulting in constitutive activation of the kinase. The following compounds were tested in an assay to measure direct inhibition of \u039a\u0393\u0393 D816V kinase activity by assaying KIT autophosphorylation at tyrosine 719 on the KIT protein. </p> In the Table below, for biochemical D816V and D842V activity, the following designations are used: &lt; 1.00 nM = A; 1.01-10.0 nM = B; 10.01-100.0 nM = C; &gt;100 nM = D; and ND = not determined. For cellular activity in the HMC 1.2 cell line, the following designations are used: A means &lt; 50 nM; B means &gt;50 and &lt;100 nM; C means &gt;100 and &lt;1000 nM; D means &gt;1000 and less than 10000 nM; E means &gt;10000 nM; and ND = not determined. \n\n Compound INH-KIT-</p>INH KIT INH PDFGRA </p> Number PHOS- D816V D842V </p> HMC1.2</p>1 D </p> 2 D E</p>3 C D</p>4 D E</p>5 C D</p>6 D E</p>7 A A B</p>8 B C</p>9 B B A</p>10 A A A</p>11 B C</p>12 A A</p>13 B C</p>14 A B A</p>15 C C</p>16 B C</p>17 B C</p>18 C C E</p>19 B C</p>20 B B A</p>21 B A B</p>22 A A A</p>23 C C</p>24 B C</p>25 A A</p>26 A A A</p>27 B A</p>28 B A</p>29 B B B</p>30 A A A</p>31 B A</p>32 B A</p>33 B C</p>34 A A B</p>35 A A A</p>36 B C</p>37 C D</p>38 B B B</p>39 B A A</p>40 B C</p>41 B B B</p>42 C D</p>43 B A</p>44 A A A \n\n45 A A A</p>46 A A A</p>47 A A</p>48 B A</p>49 A A</p>50 B A</p>51 C </p> 52 B"
