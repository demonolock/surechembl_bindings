    "n target, complete resistance to proteolytic enzymes in blood plasma, membrane permeability and activity in a cell-based excitotoxicity ex vivo assay. Affinity is increased even further by dimerization of the pentapeptide having the sequence IETAV, to get compound 83, while plasma stability is still pronounced - especially compared to the monomeric peptide ligand. \n\n IV Tools for monitoring and evaluating the inhibitor properties of the NMDAR/PSD-95 inhibitor of the invention</p>A. Fluorescence Polarization (FP) assay: as described below in Example 1 and in the Methodology section, provides a convenient and reliable way to monitor and evaluate the inhibitor properties of an NMDAR/PSD-95 inhibitor of the invention. The FP assay allows a wide range of peptide analogues to be tested and compared with respect to their interaction with PDZ domains, and their specificity with respect to the three PDZ domains, PDZ 1-3, of PSD-95. PDZ domains may be expressed individually, or as tandem domain constructs, using standard recombinant DNA technology known to those skilled in the art. Purification of the expressed PDZ domains may be facilitated by the inclusion of an affinity tag (e.g. poly-histidine-tag, Glutathione-S-transferase-tag, or antibody-tag such as FLAG-tag) in the expressed protein comprising the PDZ domain (e.g. fusion protein), and the use of an affinity resin to selective purify tagged PDZ domain proteins. More specifically, the assay is based on a heterologous competition binding assay, where the affinity measured as IC50 of a given (non- fluorescent) peptide analogue for a PDZ domain is measured in the presence of a fixed concentration of a fluorescent labelled undecapeptide peptide corresponding to the wild-type (WT) C-terminal of the NR2B subunit (YEKLSSIESDV) and CRIPT (LDTKNYKQT SV). Determined IC50 values may be converted to K<sub>\u03b3</sub> values.<sup>5</sup> Suitable fluorophores include either 5- FAM or Cy5, which may be coupled to a tripeptide (KSG or CSG) linker attached to the JV-terminus of the undecapeptide, to give 5-FAM-NR2B, Cy5-NR2B, 5-FAM- CRIPT and Cy5-CRIPT. The 5-FAM fiuorophore may be attached to the undecapeptides by coupling with HATU. The Cy5 fiuorophore may be conjugated to the undecapeptides by coupling Cy5-maleimide to the cysteine side chain of the tripeptide sequence CSG attached to the N-terminus of the peptide, as detailed in the Methodology section.</p>B. Pull-down assay: The polyhistidine pull-down is an in vitro technique that consists of a polyhistidine-tagged bait NRB2 or CRIPT protein C-terminal domain</p>(e.g NR2B WT peptide with the sequence HHHHHHYEKLS SIESDV) that can be \n\n used to identify competitors of a PDZ domain-binding partner (PDZ domain of PSD- 95) (the prey). The bait protein is immobilized on cobalt chelated affinity gel. The bait serves as the secondary affinity support for the protein partner to the bait and for identifying competitors that can displace the prey from the bait. The competitors are peptide analogues, specifically an NMDAR/PSD-95 inhibitor of the present invention. PPIs, between the prey and bait are analyzed by chemically dissociating/eluting the bound prey (PDZ domain or peptide analogue) and visualizing the prey by SDS-PAGE and associated detection methods depending on the sensitivity requirements of ",

To a fixed concentration of Cy5-NR2B, 5- FAM-NR2B, Cy5 -CRIPT or 5-FAM-CRIPT (50 nM) increasing concentrations of PDZ was added to get a saturation binding curve. The assay was performed in a IxTBS buffer (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4) including 1% BSA in black flat bottom 384-well plates (Corning Life Sciences, NY, USA). After incubation for 20- 30 mins at rt, the FP of the samples was measured on a Safire<sup>2</sup> plate-reader (Tecan, Mannedorf, Switzerland), but before reading the samples the g-factor was adjusted such that 50 nM probe without any PDZ present would give a FP value of 20 mP. Cy5-NR2B and Cy5-CRIP, as well as 5-FAM-NR2B and 5-FAM-CRIPT were measured at excitation/emission values of 635/670 nm and 470/525 nm, respectively. The FP values were fitted to the equation Y = B<sub>max</sub>*X / (Kd + X), where B<sub>max</sub> is the maximal FP value, X is the PDZ concentration, and Y is variable FP values. As long as the concentration of labeled peptide is well below the true Kd during the assay, the K<sub>d</sub> can be directly derived from this saturation curve as being equal to the PDZ concentration where the curve is half saturated (at these conditions EC50 = [total</p>PDZJhalf saturation = [free PDZJhalf saturation = ^d)-</p>To measure the affinities between non-fluorescent peptides and PDZ domains, heterologous competition bindings assay were performed. This was done by adding increasing concentrations of peptide to a fixed concentration of Cy5-</p>NR2B, 5-FAM-NR2B, Cy5-CRIPT or 5-FAM-CRIPT (50 nM) and PDZ (20 \u03bcM for</p>PDZl, 3 \u03bcM for PDZ2 and 1-2 and 5 \u03bcM for PDZ3) in the same TBS buffer and conditions as described above. FP values were then fitted to the general equation: Y = Bottom + (Top-Bottom)/[l+(10<sup>\u039bX logIC50</sup>)], where X is the logarithmic value of peptide concentration. Hereby the IC50 value was obtained, which is used to calculate the theoretical competitive inhibition constant, K<sub>1</sub>.<sup>5</sup></p>Stopped- flow fluorimetry: The HIS-PDZ2 and HIS-PDZ 1-2 expression constructs of PSD-95 were genetically manipulated to encode a tryptophan, (in position 51 of SEQ ID NO: 4 and position 145 in SEQ ID NO: 8, respectively) instead of \n\n isoleucine. Binding between PDZ2 and PDZ1-2 and peptide ligand 74 was then monitored and quantified, by measuring the fluorescence increase from this tryptophan upon ligand recognition, (excitation \u03bb at 280 nm, emission \u03bb &gt; 320 nm). Stopped- flow measurements were performed at 1O<sup>0</sup>C or 25<sup>0</sup>C on an SX-20MV stopped-flow spectrometer (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK). The peptide, in varying amounts, was rapidly mixed with a constant amount of PDZ and the change in fluorescence was measured over time. The fluorescence versus time plots was fitted to a single or double exponential equation, from which one or two observed rate constants were obtained. Observed rate constants were then plotted against the concentration of the varied species and microscopic rate constants determined by fitting the data to the equation for a bimolecular association (Eq. 1) kobs = ((kon<sup>2</sup> (n-[A]of + Kff +2 k<sub>on</sub>k<sub>off</sub>(n+[A]o)f<sup>5</sup> (Eq. 1) kon is the association rate constant, k<sub>o</sub>s is the dissociation rate constant, and [A]o and n are the initial concentrations of the varied and constants species, respectively.</p>To determine k<sub>o</sub>s rates, a chase experiment was conducted. In this experiment, PDZ 1-21195 W in complex with 74 was mixed with non-mutated PDZ 1-2, whereby 74 was competed out. At high concentrations of non-mutated PDZ 1-2, the observed rate constant approaches the net off-rate constant for the binding reaction (\u00a3<sub>o</sub>ff<sup>app</sup>) between 74 and PDZ1-2. Observed rate constants were fitted to Eq. 2 to estimate the apparent, or net, off-rate constant for the peptide, k<sub>o</sub>fi<sup>vv</sup>.

From these sequences homology models were \n\n created using the PDZ3 X-ray crystal structure (PDB structure 1BE9)<sup>10</sup> as template in Prime with standard parameters. The peptide ligand from 1BE9, KQTSV, was rebuilt to IESDV in the homology models. The side chains of the PDZ domain and the peptide were then minimized in Macromodel (Schr\u03ccdinger, Portland, OR, USA) using the force field OPLS2005 and by constraining the backbone. A grid around the peptide was generated in Glide (Schr\u03ccdinger, Portland, OR, USA) and used for docking. Relevant peptides were docked flexibly in Glide using default parameters, and the best scoring poses were energy minimized. The conserved water molecule seen in the binding pocket was kept constant during docking and minimization. Pymol, version 0.97, was used for creating figures.<sup>11</sup></p>Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC): Calorimetry experiments were performed on a microcalorimeter (Microcal, MA, USA). The ligands were titrated directly into the PDZ solution. All ligands and PDZ proteins were sol",

Each sample of neurons was washed at least one time in TM medium to remove the NMDAR/PSD-95 inhibitor, and placed in TM medium. 4. After various periods of time, the samples of neurons were exposed to NMDA at a concentration of between 10-100 \u03bcM for a period of 0.5 to 1.5 hours, preferably 1 hour, after which the samples were again placed in TM medium for 24 hours. 5. LDH in the cell medium was quantified using commercial available kits (e.g. Promega Biotech AB, cat no G 1780).</p>Example 1. A Fluorescence Polarization Assay for detecting interactions between peptide analogues and PDZ domains. A convenient and reliable way to examine interactions between peptide analogues and PDZ domains is by using a fluorescence polarization (FP) assay. The three PDZ domains, PDZ1-3, of PSD-95 were expressed individually as set out above, while PDZ 1-2 was also expressed as a tandem construct. As set out above, fluorescent peptides were synthesized by labelling the undecapeptide peptides corresponding to the wild-type (WT) C-terminal of the NR2B subunit (YEKLSSIESDV) and CPJPT (LDTKNYKQTSV) with either 5-FAM or Cy5, through a tripeptide (KSG or CSG) linker, at the //-terminus (designated 5-FAM-NR2B, Cy5-NR2B, 5-FAM-CPJPT and Cy5-CRIPT).<sup>12</sup> K<sub>d</sub> values were then determined. A competition binding assay was also implemented, to measure the affinity as IC<sub>50</sub> values between PDZ domains and non- fluorescent NR2B (1, KSG-YEKLSSIESDV) and CRIPT (2, KS G-LDTKNYKQT SV) peptides. IC<sub>50</sub> values were then converted to K<sub>1</sub> values.<sup>5</sup></p>Since K^ and K<sub>1</sub> values should be similar when measuring the same PDZ-peptide interaction, these values were compared for the NR2B derived peptides (PDZl, PDZ2, and PDZ 1-2) and CRIPT derived peptides (PDZ3). The K<sub>d</sub> and K<sub>1</sub> values were found to be very similar when measured against PDZl, PDZ2 and PDZ3, although the K<sub>1</sub> for the tandem construct PDZ 1-2 is somewhat higher than K<sub>d</sub> (Table 1). \n\n Table 1.

Thus, the notable in vivo effects demonstrated for this Tat-NR2B peptide<sup>1</sup> are more likely due to the ability of the Tat-moiety to improve membrane permeability \n\n of peptides, rather than increasing the affinity between peptide ligand and the PDZ domains of PSD-95.</p>Example 2.

    "c ligands, linked by PEG, are shown to have greatly increased affinity towards PDZ 1-2 \n\n of PSD-95. Initially, this is demonstrated by the use of PEG molecules to chemically link two identical peptide ligands (IESDV) as in compound 74 or the alkylated GE(R)TDV (R=cyclohexylethyl; JV-alkylated in P<sup>\"3</sup>) pentapeptide as in compound 75 (see structures in figure 7). In both these examples a dramatic increase in affinity for the tandem construct PDZ 1-2 is seen (See Figure 8 and K<sub>1</sub> values in table 6), reflecting the synergistic effect that is obtained by linking two ligands together.</p>Table 7.
