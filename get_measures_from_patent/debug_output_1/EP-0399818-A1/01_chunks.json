    " the malonate of Step 3.</p>Step 5 Ethyl alpha-((acetylthio)methyl)cyclopropaneacetateA solution of 14.1 g (0.100 mol) of the acrylate from Step 4 in 57 mL (0.40 mol) of triethylamine was diluted with 21.5 mL (0.30 mol) of thiolacetic acid. This solution was heated at 70\u00b0C for 8 h and left at r.t. for 15 h. Addition of a volume of Et<sub>2</sub>O gave two phases, which were separated. The bottom phase was reextracted with Et<sub>2</sub>0. The organic phases were washed twice with 25% aq NH<sub>4</sub>OAc, once with 10% aq NH<sub>4</sub>OAC, dried over MgS04 and evaporated. Kugelrohr distillation at 120\u00b0C/0.25 mm Hg gave 14.89 g (69%) of the title compound as an orange oil.</p>'H NMR (CDCl<sub>3</sub>) \u03b4: 0.38 (2H, m), 0.57 (2H, m), 0.96 (1 H, m), 1.28 (3H, t), 1.85 (1 H, m), 2.33 (3H, s), 3.21 (2H, m), 4.18 (2H, m).</p>Step 6Hydrolysis of the thioester of Step 5 using the procedure of Example 113, Step 2, afforded the title thiol.</p>Thiol 15 Methyl 3-mercapto-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanoateStep 1 Ethyl 2-methyl-2-oxiranecarboxylateTo a solution of 85% m-CPBA (meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, 42.0 g, 244 mmol) in 1,2-dichloroethane (500 mL) containing BHT (500 mg) was added in one portion ethyl methacrylate (10 g, 174 mmol). After 2 h at 70\u00b0 C, the reaction mixture was filtered and the solid washed with CH<sub>2</sub>CI<sub>2</sub>. The filtrate was then partially evaporated and diluted with CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>. The organic phase was successively washed with sat. NaHCOa, aq KI, NazS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and NaHCO<sub>3</sub>. The organic phase was then dried over Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, filtered and evaporated. The desired epoxide was distilled at 72\u00b0 C/16 mm Hg to give 16.0 g (70%) of title material.</p>'H NMR (CD<sub>3</sub>COCD<sub>3</sub>) \u03b4: 1.35 (3H, t), 1.61 (3H, s), 2.91 (1H, d), 3.16 (1H, d), 4.33 (2H, q).</p>Step 2 Ethyl 3-(benzylthio)-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanoateTo a solution of the epoxide of Step 1 (5.0 g, 38 mmol), in EtOH (22 mL) at 0\u00b0 C was added an EtOH solution containing NaOH (1.55 g) and benzyl mercaptan (4.2 g, 38 mmol). After 1 h, the reaction mixture was quenched by the addition of 25% aq NH<sub>4</sub>OAc and the thioether extracted with EtOAc. After drying over NaS0<sub>4</sub>, evaporation and flask chromatography, 8.8 g (70%) of title material were obtained.</p><sup>1</sup>H NMR (CD<sub>3</sub>COCD<sub>3</sub>) \u03b4: 1.25 (3H, t), 1.38 (3H, s), 2.70 (2H, AB), 3.41 (1H, s), 3.58 (2H, AB), 4.15 (2H, q), 7.13 - 7.33 (5H, m).</p>Step 3Using the procedure of Example 229, Steps 3-5, the compound of Step 2 was converted to the title thiol.</p>Thiol 16 2-(Mercaptomethyl)benzoic acid2-(iodomethyl)benzoic acid, a precursor of lodide 1, was substituted with thiolacetic acid (1.2 equiv) in the presence of K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> in DMF at 60 C for an hour to give the thioacetate, which was hydrolyzed with NaOH to give the title thiol.</p>Thiol 17 5-Chloro-2-(mercaptomethyl)benzoic acidThis thiol was obtained from lodide"
