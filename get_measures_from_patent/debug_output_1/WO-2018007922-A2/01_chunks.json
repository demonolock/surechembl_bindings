    "art of the epitope. Thus, for example, an epitope within amino acids 89-97 of TTR may consist of amino acids 89-97, 89-96, 90-96, 91-96, 92-96, 93-96, 94-96, 89-96, 89-95, 89-94, 89-93, 89-92 or 89-93, among other linear segments of SEQ ID NO: 113, or in the case of conformational epitopes, non-contiguous segments of amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 113. </p>[00176] Antibodies that recognize the same or overlapping epitopes can be identified in a simple immunoassay showing the ability of one antibody to compete with the binding of another antibody to a target antigen. The epitope of an antibody can also be defined X-ray </p>crystallography of the antibody bound to its antigen to identify contact residues. Alternatively, two antibodies have the same epitope if all amino acid mutations in the antigen that reduce or eliminate binding of one antibody reduce or eliminate binding of the other. Two antibodies have \n\n overlapping epitopes if some amino acid mutations that reduce or eliminate binding of one antibody reduce or eliminate binding of the other. </p>[00177] Competition between antibodies is determined by an assay in which an antibody under test inhibits specific binding of a reference antibody to a common antigen (see, e.g., Junghans et al., Cancer Res. 50: 1495, 1990). A test antibody competes with a reference antibody if an excess of a test antibody (e.g., at least 2x, 5x, lOx, 20x or lOOx) inhibits binding of the reference antibody by at least 50% as measured in a competitive binding assay. Some test antibodies inhibit binding of the references antibody by at least 75%, 90% or 99%. Antibodies identified by competition assay (competing antibodies) include antibodies binding to the same epitope as the reference antibody and antibodies binding to an adjacent epitope sufficiently proximal to the epitope bound by the reference antibody for steric hindrance to occur. </p>[00178] The term \"native\" with respect to the structure transthyretin (TTR) refers to the normal folded structure of TTR in its properly functioning state (i.e., a TTR tetramer). As TTR is a tetramer in its natively folded form, non-native forms of TTR include, for example, misfolded TTR tetramers, TTR monomers, aggregated forms of TTR, and fibril forms of TTR. Non-native forms of TTR can include molecules comprising wild-type TTR amino acid sequences or mutations. </p>[00179] The term \"misfolded\" with respect to TTR refers to the secondary and tertiary structure of a TTR polypeptide monomer or multimer, and indicates that the polypeptide has adopted a conformation that is not normal for that protein in its properly functioning state. </p>Although TTR misfolding can be caused by mutations in the protein (e.g., deletion, substitution, or addition), wild-type TTR proteins can also be misfolded in diseases, exposing specific epitopes. </p>[00180] The term \"pharmaceutically acceptable\" means that the carrier, diluent, excipient, or auxiliary is compatible with the other ingredients of the f",
    "inked with a promoter and enhancer from a mammary gland specific gene, such as casein or beta lactoglobulin. </p>[00256] The vectors containing the DNA segments of interest can be transferred into the host cell by methods depending on the type of cellular host. For example, calcium chloride transfection is commonly utilized for prokaryotic cells, whereas calcium phosphate treatment, electroporation, lipofection, biolistics, or viral-based transfection can be used for other cellular hosts. Other methods used to transform mammalian cells include the use of polybrene, protoplast fusion, liposomes, electroporation, and microinjection. For production of transgenic animals, transgenes can be microinjected into fertilized oocytes or can be incorporated into the genome of embryonic stem cells, and the nuclei of such cells transferred into enucleated oocytes. </p>[00257] Having introduced vector(s) encoding antibody heavy and light chains into cell culture, cell pools can be screened for growth productivity and product quality in serum-free media. Top-producing cell pools can then be subjected of FACS-based single-cell cloning to generate monoclonal lines. Specific productivities above 50 pg or 100 pg per cell per day, which correspond to product titers of greater than 7.5 g/L culture, can be used. Antibodies produced by single cell clones can also be tested for turbidity, filtration properties, PAGE, IEF, UV scan, HP- SEC, carbohydrate-oligosaccharide mapping, mass spectrometry, and binding assay, such as ELISA or Biacore. A selected clone can then be banked in multiple vials and stored frozen for subsequent use. </p>[00258] Once expressed, antibodies can be purified according to standard procedures of the art, including protein A capture, HPLC purification, column chromatography, gel electrophoresis and the like (see generally, Scopes, Protein Purification (Springer- Verlag, NY, 1982)). </p>[00259] Methodology for commercial production of antibodies can be employed, including codon optimization, selection of promoters, selection of transcription elements, selection of terminators, serum-free single cell cloning, cell banking, use of selection markers for \n\n amplification of copy number, CHO terminator, or improvement of protein titers (see, e.g., US 5,786,464; US 6,114,148; US 6,063,598; US 7,569,339; W02004/050884; W02008/012142; W02008/012142; W02005/019442; W02008/107388; W02009/027471; and US 5,888,809). </p>H. Antibody Screening Assays </p>[00260] Antibodies can be subject to several screens including binding assays, functional screens, screens in animal models of diseases associated with TTR deposits, and clinical trials. Binding assays test for specific binding and, optionally, affinity and epitope specificity to monomeric TTR or a fragment thereof. For example, binding assays can screen for antibodies that bind to amino acid residues 89-97 (SEQ ID NO: 113) of TTR, which is an epitope that is buried in the native TTR tetramer and exposed in monom",
    "pon dissociation of the tetramer into its monomeric subunits. The region identified was residues 89-97 (EHAEVVFTA) (SEQ ID NO: 113) located within the F strand of TTR and sequestered at the dimer interface of the tetrameric protein. A BLAST search of the protein database did not reveal any other human proteins possessing this sequence. \n\n [00312] A peptide comprising this sequence (ggEHAEVVFTAggkg) (SEQ ID NO: 114), was synthesized. Capitalized letters represent residues 89-97 of TTR. Lower case letters represent additional linker residues added to increase the solubility of the antigenic peptide and to establish the 9 amino acid fragment as an internal sequence. This peptide was linked to a poly-lysine dendritic core, generating a multiple antigenic peptide immunogen (TTR-MAP) comprising a core of lysine residues with multiple branches linked to the TTR 89-97 peptide. The antibodies listed in Table 2 were generated against TTR-MAP. </p>[00313] In addition to this multiple antigenic peptide, two other immunogens containing the same TTR fragment were generated by covalently linking similar TTR 89-97 peptides (Ac- cggEHAEVVFTA-amide (SEQ ID NO: 115) and Ac-EH AE V VFT Acgg- amide (SEQ ID NO: 116)) via the N- and C-terminal cysteine residues to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (TTR89-97-N- KLH and TTR89-97-C-KLH). </p>[00314] Following antibody generation, screening, expression, and purification, detailed binding kinetic parameters (association rate (k<sub>a</sub>), dissociation rate (kd), and binding affinity constant (K<sub>D</sub>)) were determined for lead mis-TTR antibodies by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) for recombinant human TTR F87M/L110M, as shown in Table 2. Anti-mouse IgG (GE Healthcare) was immobilized on a sensor chip C5 (lacking dextran chains) via amine coupling following the instructions provided in the GE Healthcare anti-mouse kit , and mis-TTR mAbs were captured to a level to ensure a maximum binding of analyte of 30-50 RU. Various concentrations of analyte (recombinant human TTR F87M/L110M) were passed over the captured ligand at 30 \u03bc\u0390/min in running buffer (HBS + 0.05% P-20, 1 mg/mL BSA) in 3-fold dilutions. For each concentration, the reaction proceeded for a time frame allowing for the higher analyte concentrations to reach equilibrium during association, as well as at least 10% of signal to decay during dissociation. At least one concentration (not the highest or lowest) was run in duplicate. Concentration ranges of analyte were selected based on preliminary experimentation to span at least 10-fold above K<sub>D</sub> to 10-fold below K<sub>D</sub>. </p>[00315] The results of SPR analysis of lead mis-TTR mAbs is shown in Table 2 below. \n\n Table 2 </p><img id=\"imgf000073_0001\" path=\"imgf000073_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/418631418/WO/20180111/A2/002018/00/79/22/imgf000073_0001.tif\"/></p>Example 2. Binding of mis-TTR Antibodies to TTR Antigen </p> [00316] Four lead mis-TTR mAbs (9D5, 14G8, 6C1, and 5A1) were assayed by ELISA at concentrations ranging from 0.31 to 2.5 \u03bcg/ml using both pH4.0-treated TTR (pH4-TTR) and native TTR as the coating antigen. TTR antigen preparation and ELISA protocols are described elsewhere in Materials and Methods (e-g). </p>[00317] The resulting binding curves and tabulated Kd and B<sub>m</sub>ax values are shown in Figure 3 and Table 3 below. The results in Figure 3 are presented in arbitrary units (a.u.) on the y-axis. All mAbs showed significant binding to pH4-TTR with Kd values ranging from 16 nM (6C1) to 282 nM (9D5). B<sub>ma</sub>x values for binding to pH4-TTR ranged from a low of 0.65 a.u. (14G8) to a high of 2.02 (9D5). In contrast to the binding to pH4-TTR, none of the antibodies showed significant binding to native TTR, indicating that all TTR antibodies generated were specific for non-native forms of TTR. </p>Table 3 </p> ELISA Analysis of Lead mis-TTR Antibodies Binding to pH4-TTR </p><img id=\"imgf000073_0002\" path=\"imgf000073_0002.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/418631353/WO/20180111/A2/002018/00/79/22/imgf000073_0002.tif\"/></p>Example 3. Analysis of mis-TTR Antibodies by SDS-PAGE and Native-PAGE </p> [00318] 9D5 and 14G8 were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western to demonstrate specificity of binding toward monomeric/denatured forms of TTR versus native, non-denatured TTR. SDS- \n\n PAGE, Native-PAGE, and Western Blot protocols are described elsewhere in the Methods and Materials (h-j). </p>[00319] Non-denatured TTR or pH4-TTR was run on an SDS-PAGE gel alongside heat- denatured TTR and heat-denatured pH4-TTR. After electrophoresis, the gel was Western blotted onto nitrocellulose and stained with TTR mAbs 9D5 and 14G8. Both antibodies only recognized TTR when it was treated at pH4 or when TTR or pH4-TTR was first heat-denatured prior to SDS-PAGE. These 9D5 and 14G8 thus show a specificity for TTR conformers generated either by denaturation of TTR or by treatment of TTR at pH4. </p>[00320] 6C1 and 5A1 along with tot",
    "is-TTR Antibodies </p> [00326] TTR-Y78F is a TTR variant containing a point mutation at position 78 in the protein sequence that destabilizes the TTR tetramer. With time and under mildly acidic conditions, this TTR variant dissociates into its monomeric subunits which can then go on to aggregate and form fibers capable of binding to thioflavin-T. The extent of fiber formation can thus be monitored by measuring thioflavin-T fluorescence at 480nm. Introduction of a mis-TTR antibody specific for dissociated TTR monomers or aggregates would prevent the assembly of TTR fibers resulting in a decrease in thioflavin-T fluorescence relative to a no-antibody control reaction. Protocols for examining inhibition of TTR fiber formation are described elsewhere in the Materials and Methods (k). </p>[00327] All four mis-TTR antibodies strongly inhibited the formation of thioflavin-T reactive TTR-Y78F fibers relative to the isotype control. The results are shown in Figure 4A and are presented in arbitrary units (a.u.) on the y-axis. Mis-TTR antibody 5A1 almost completely inhibited fiber formation. These results are consistent with the notion that mis-TTR antibodies \n\n bind monomeric and/or aggregated forms of TTR, thereby preventing the formation of TTR fibers. </p>[00328] Table 4 summarizes the characterization data obtained for the set of 4 mis-TTR antibodies (9D5, 14G8, 6C1, and 5A1) that showed good conformational selectivity for non- native forms of TTR. These antibodies had affinities (KD) for pH4-TTR ranging from 14.5 nM (6C1) to 257 nM (9D5) and B<sub>max</sub> values ranging from 0.65 a.u. (14G8) to 2.02 (9D5). None of these antibodies recognized native TTR, but did bind to pH4-TTR on an SDS-PAGE/Western and to the high molecular weight TTR aggregates on a native-PAGE/Western. These antibodies also inhibited the formation of TTR fibrils in the fibril formation assay using Thio-T as the readout. </p>Table 4 </p> -TTR-Y78F mAb Characterization Summary Table </p><img id=\"imgf000076_0001\" path=\"imgf000076_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/418631396/WO/20180111/A2/002018/00/79/22/imgf000076_0001.tif\"/></p>[00329] TTR-V122I is a TTR variant containing a single point mutation at position 122 that destabilizes the tetramer. Fibril formation was associated with an increase in ThT fluorescence Increasing 14G8 mAb concentrations caused a monotonic decrease in ThT fluorescence indicating a substoichiometric inhibition of TTR fibrillation (IC5o=0.028\u00b10.009 mg/mL; n=3; Figure 4B and Table 4a). The isotype control mAb did not cause inhibition of TTR fibrillation (Figure 4C), thus demonstrating the specificity of 14G8 mediated inhibition. \n\n [00330] Comparable substoichiometric IC<sub>50</sub> values determined for 5A1 and 6C1 (Table 4a) suggested analogous mechanisms of fibril inhibition for each of these mis-TTR mAbs. In contrast, 9D5 unexpectedly failed to inhibit TTR-V122I fibril formation, despite showing similar specificity and affinity ",
    "rotein quality analysis along with aggregation potential analyses showed no obvious clusters of aggregation-prone residues present in the 9D5 light chain or heavy chain framework regions or CDRs (Wang et al., mAbs l(3):254-267, 2009). </p>Example 8.

Anti-human (GE Healthcare) was immobilized on sensor chip C5 (lacking dextran chains) via amine coupling following the instructions provided in the GE Healthcare anti-human \n\n kit, and mAbs were captured to a level to ensure a maximum binding of analyte of 30-50 RU.

After the last treatment, the mice are euthanized, the skin containing the implant collected and processed, and then the amount of TTR deposits remaining assessed using histological and/ or biochemical methods. Quantitative analysis and statistics are employed to determine the degree of clearance seen among groups. </p>Example 15. Electron and atomic force microscopy </p>[00470] Immunogold transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to generate images of the interaction between mis-TTR mAbs and both aggregated and fibrillar forms of the protein. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was carried out by titrating 14G8 into a solution of aggregated TTR using standard methods. Using TEM, immunogold labeling with 14G8 was observed in TTR-V122I oligomer aggregates and fibril ends (Fig. 8A), whereas immunogold labeling with an anti-TTR pAb shows binding along the lengths of TTR fibers and to oligomeric clusters (Fig. 8B). IgGl isotype control mAb does not show immunogold labeling (Fig. 8C). TTR-V122I fibers, alone and in the presence of 14G8 \u00b1 6 nm colloidal gold-conjugated secondary antibody, were assessed using AFM. Gold labeling was observed at fiber ends (Fig. 8D). Fig. 9A shows isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) data and binding isotherms for 14G8 binding to aggregated TTR variants. Fig. 9B shows binding fitted to a 2-binding site model with KD values shown. TEM, AFM, and ITC analysis provide evidence mis-TTR mAbs bind to TTR aggregates and fibrils primarily at 2 distinct sites: oligomers and fibril ends. \n\n Example 16: Antibody binding to TTR amyloid in the peripheral nerves and gastrointestinal tract of a patient with ATTR amyloidosis from a TTR-V30M mutation </p>[00471] 14G8 and control antibodies were evaluated immunohistochemically to determine their reactivity for TTR amyloid deposits in nerve, and gastrointestinal tract samples obtained from patients with confirmed diagnoses of ATTR amyloidosis from a V30M mutation.
