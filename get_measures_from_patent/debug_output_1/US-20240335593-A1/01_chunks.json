    "s including the Delta-like and Jagged families. As used herein, the terms \u201cNotch agonist\u201d and \u201cNotch activator\u201d refer to molecules (e.g., biomolecules, small molecules, chemicals) that bind to Notch receptor and initiate or mediate signaling events associated with Notch activation. Resveratrol (3,4,5-trihydroxystilbene) belongs to a class of polyphenolic compounds called stilbenes and is an activator (agonist) of Notch signaling. Other Notch agonists appropriate for use according to methods for promoting arterial differentiation provided herein include valproic acid and suberoyl bishydroxamic acid. In addition, immobilized or multimerized soluble Notch ligands such as immobilized DLL4 and immobilized Jagged-1 peptide also can be used as Notch activators.</p>Inositol monophosphatase (IMPase) catalyzes the hydrolysis of myo-inositol monophosphates to myo-inositol, which is required in the phosphoinositide cell signaling pathway. In some embodiments, an inhibitor of IMPase is the biphosphonate L-690,330 ([1-(4-Hydroxyphenoxy)ethylidene]bisphosphonic acid). Lithium also inhibits IMPase to attenuate phosphoinositide signaling (Berridge et al., Cell 59:411-419 (1989)). Other inhibitors of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway include, without limitation, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor Ly294002, Pictilisib, HS-173, GSK2636771, Duvelisib, TG100-115, GSK1059615, PF-04691502, PIK-93, BGT226, AZD6482, SAR245409, BYL719, CUDC-907, IC-87114, TG100713, Gedatolisib, CH5132799, PKI-402, BAY 80-6946, XL147, PIK-90, PIK-293, PIK-294, Quercetin, Wortmannin, ZSTK474, AS-252424, AS-604850, and Apitolisib.</p>A suitable working concentration range for chemical inhibitors of IMPase, TGF\u03b2 receptors, and other described herein is from about 0.1 \u03bcM to about 100 \u03bcM, e.g., about 2 \u03bcM. 5 \u03bcM, 7 \u03bcM, 10 \u03bcM, 12 \u03bcM, 15 \u03bcM, 18 \u03bcM, or another working concentration of one or more the foregoing chemical inhibitors between about 0.1 \u03bcM to about 100 \u03bcM.</p>Preferably, mesodermal cells are cultured in the AEC differentiation medium until at least about 80% (e.g., at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98%, or more) of cells in the resulting cell population are arterial endothelial cells.</p>For several of the biological markers described herein, expression will be low or intermediate in level. While it is commonplace to refer to cells as \u201cpositive\u201d or \u201cnegative\u201d for a particular marker, actual expression levels are a quantitative trait. The number of molecules on the cell surface can vary by several logs, yet still be characterized as \u201cpositive.\u201d Accordingly, characterization of the level of staining permits subtle distinctions between cell populations. Expression levels can be detected or monitored by flow cytometry, where lasers detect the quantitative levels of fluorochrome (which is proportional to the amount of cell surface antigen bound by the antibodies). Flow cytometry or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) can be used to separate cell populations based on the intensit"
