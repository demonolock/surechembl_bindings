    "linesFor the construction of expression plasmids the coding sequences of human, rat and mouse TAAR 1 were amplified from genomic DNA essentially as described by Lindemann et al. [14]. The Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Diagnostics) was used with 1.5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> and purified PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen) following the instructions of the manufacturer. PCR products were subcloned into the pIRESneo2 vector (BD Clontech, Palo Alto, California), and expression vectors were sequence verified before introduction in cell lines.</p>HEK293 cells (ATCC # CRL-1573) were cultured essentially as described by Lindemann et al. (2005). For the generation of stably transfected cell lines HEK293 cells were transfected with the pIRESneo2 expression plasmids containing the TAAR coding sequences (described above) with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer, and 24 hrs post transfection the culture medium was supplemented with 1 mg/ml G418 (Sigma, Buchs, Switzerland). After a culture period of about 10 d clones were isolated, expanded and tested for responsiveness to trace amines (all compounds purchased from Sigma) with the cAMP Biotrak Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) System (Amersham) following the non-acetylation EIA procedure provided by the manufacturer. Monoclonal cell lines which displayed a stable EC<sub>50</sub> for a culture period of 15 passages were used for all subsequent studies.</p>Radioligand binding assay on rat TAAR1Membrane Preparation and Radioligand Binding.HEK-293 cells stably expressing rat TAAR1 were maintained at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in DMEM high glucose medium, containing fetal calf serum (10%, heat inactivated for 30 min at 56 \u00b0C), penicillin/streptomycin (1%), and 375 \u00b5g/ml geneticin (Gibco). Cells were released from culture flasks using trypsin/ EDTA, harvested, washed twice with ice-cold PBS (without Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>), pelleted at 1'000 rpm for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C, frozen and stored at -80 \u00b0C. Frozen pellets were suspended in 20 ml HEPES-NaOH (20 mM, pH 7.4) containing 10 mM EDTA and homogenized with a Polytron (PT 6000, Kinematica) at 14'000 rpm for 20 s. The homogenate was centrifuged at 48'000 x g for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C. Subsequently, the supernatant was removed and discarded, and the pellet resuspended in 20 ml HEPES-NaOH (20 mM, pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mM EDTA using the Polytron (20 s at 14'000 rpm). This procedure was repeated and the final pellet resuspended in HEPES-NaOH containing 0.1 mM EDTA and homogenized using the Polytron. Typically, aliquots of 2 ml membrane portions were stored at -80 \u00b0C. With each new membrane batch the dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) was determined via a saturation curve. The TAAR1 radioligand <sup>3</sup>[H]-(S)-4-[(ethyl-phenyl-amino)-methyl]-4,5-dihydro-oxazol-2-ylamine (described in WO 2008/098857</patcit>) was used at a concentration equal to the calculated K<sub>d</sub> value, that was usually around 2.3 nM, resulting in the binding of approximately 0.2% of the radioligand and a specific binding representing approximately 85% of the total binding. Nonspecific binding was defined as the amount of <sup>3</sup>[H]-(S)-4-[(ethyl-phenyl-amino)-methyl]-4,5-dihydro-oxazol-2-ylamine bound in the presence of 10 \u00b5M unlabeled ligand. All compounds were tested at a broad range of concentrations (10 pM to 10 \u00b5M) in duplicates. The test compounds (20 \u00b5l/well) were transferred into a 96 deep well plate (TreffLab), and 180 \u00b5l of HEPES-NaOH (20 mM, pH 7.4) containing MgCl<sub>2</sub> (10 mM) and CaCl<sub>2</sub> (2 mM) (binding buffer), 300 \u00b5l of the radioligand <sup>3</sup>[H]-(S)-4-[(ethyl-phenyl-amino)-methyl]-4,5-dihydro-oxazol-2-ylamine at a concentration of 3.3 x K<sub>d</sub> in nM and 500 \u00b5l of the membranes (resuspended at 50 \u00b5g protein per ml) added. The 96 deep well plates were incubated for 1 hr at 4 \u00b0C. Incubations were terminated by rapid filtration through Unifilter-96 plates (Packard Instrument Company) and glass filters GF/C (Perkin Elmer) presoaked for 1 hr in polyethylenimine (0.3%) and washed 3 times with 1 ml of cold binding buffer. After addition of 45 \u00b5l of Microscint 40 (PerkinElmer) the Unifilter-96 plate was sealed and after 1 hr the ratioactivity counted using a TopCount Microplate Scintillation Counter (Packard Instrument Company).</p>Radioligand binding assay on mouse TAAR1Membrane Preparation and Radioligand Binding.HEK-293 cells stably expressing mouse TAAR1 were maintained at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in DMEM high glucose medium, containing fetal calf serum (10%, heat inactivated for 30 min at 56 \u00b0C), penicillin/streptomycin (1%), and 375 \u00b5g/ml geneticin (Gibco).
