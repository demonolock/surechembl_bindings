{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n1. The TAAR1 radioligand <sup>3</sup>[H]-(S)-4-[(ethyl-phenyl-amino)-methyl]-4,5-dihydro-oxazol-2-ylamine was used at a concentration equal to the calculated K<sub>d</sub> value, that was usually around 2.3 nM, resulting in the binding of approximately 0.2% of the radioligand and a specific binding representing approximately 85% of the total binding.\n2. The TAAR1 radioligand <sup>3</sup>[H]-(S)-4-[(ethyl-phenyl-amino)-methyl]-4,5-dihydro-oxazol-2-ylamine was used at a concentration equal to the calculated K<sub>d</sub> value, that was usually around 0.7 nM, resulting in the binding of approximately 0.5% of the radioligand and a specific binding representing approximately 70% of the total binding.\n3. Monoclonal cell lines which displayed a stable EC<sub>50</sub> for a culture period of 15 passages were used for all subsequent studies.\n\nNote that sentence 3 does not contain a specific numeric value for the EC50 metric, so it may not meet the criteria. However, I included it as it mentions a specific molecule (TAAR1) and a bioactivity metric (EC50).\n\nSentences 1 and 2 meet the criteria as they contain:\n\n* A specific molecule name/identifier: <sup>3</sup>[H]-(S)-4-[(ethyl-phenyl-amino)-methyl]-4,5-dihydro-oxazol-2-ylamine (TAAR1 radioligand)\n* A bioactivity metric: K<sub>d</sub>\n* A specific numeric value for that metric: 2.3 nM and 0.7 nM\n* A unit for that value: nM"}
