In addition, CDK9 inhibition assay uses CDK 9/cell cycleProtein T1 complex (8nM) and \"5-FAM-CDK 9 tide\" peptide substrate (2. mu.M, synthetic fluorophore-tagged peptide with the sequence 5-FAM-GSRTPMY (SEQ ID No.2) -NH<sub>2</sub>5-FAM is as defined above and NH<sub>2</sub>Representing a C-terminal amide) and containing 10mM MgCl in the buffer composition listed above<sub>2</sub>. CDK12 inhibition assay Using CDK12(aa 686-1082)/cyclin K complex (50nM) and \"5-FAM-CDK 9 tide\" (2. mu.M) as defined above, and containing 2mM MgCl in the buffer composition listed above<sub>2</sub>. In addition, the CDK2 inhibition assay used the CDK 2/cyclin E1 complex (0.5nM) and the \"5-FAM-CDK 7 tide\" (2. mu.M) as defined above, and contained 2mM MgCl in the buffer compositions listed above<sub>2</sub>. The incubation period at 27 \u2103 for each CDK inhibitory assay was chosen such that the proportion of phosphorylated peptide product produced in each assay relative to total peptide concentration was about 20% (\u00b1 5%) for uninhibited kinase (35 min for CDK7, 35 min for CDK2, 35 min for CDK12, 3h for CDK9, 15 min). Where the test compound titrated and resulted in inhibition of peptide product formation, fitting of these data yielded the best fit IC50 values.</p><p id=\"p0913\" num=\"0909\">The results of these measurements are shown in Table 1 below, where \"A\" represents the calculated IC<sub>50</sub>Greater than 1nM and less than or equal to 10 nM; \"B\" denotes calculated IC<sub>50</sub>Greater than 10nM and less than or equal to 100 nM; \"C\" denotes calculated IC<sub>50</sub>Greater than 100nM and less than or equal to 1000 nM; \"D\" denotes the calculated IC<sub>50</sub>Greater than 1000 nM; \"NT\" means that the specified compound was not tested in the specified assay.</p><p id=\"p0914\" num=\"0910\">Table 1 inhibitory activity of compounds of the invention against CDK2, CDK7, CDK9 and CDK 12.</p><p id=\"p0915\" num=\"0911\"></p><p id=\"p0916\" num=\"0912\"></p><p id=\"p0917\" num=\"0913\">The above results indicate that the compounds of the invention have good inhibitory activity and selectivity against CDK 7.</p><p id=\"p0918\" num=\"0914\">The technical features of the embodiments described above may be arbitrarily combined, and for the sake of brevity, all possible combinations of the technical features in the embodiments described above are not described, but should be considered as being within the scope of the present specification as long as there is no contradiction between the combinations of the technical features.
