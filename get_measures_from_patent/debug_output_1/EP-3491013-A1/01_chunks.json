    "which the native T-cell was isolated. In some embodiments, the organism is human or murine. </p> [0073] The terms \"binding affinity,\" and \"binding avidity\" as used herein means the specific binding affinity and specific binding avidity, respectively, of a protein for its counter- structure under specific binding conditions. In biochemical kinetics avidity refers to the accumulated strength of multiple affinities of individual non-covalent binding interactions, such as between CD155 and its counter-structures TIGIT, CD226, and/or CD96. As such, avidity is distinct from affinity, which describes the strength of a single interaction. An increase or attenuation in binding affinity of a variant CD 155 containing an affinity modified CD 155 IgSF domain to its counter- structure is determined relative to the binding affinity of the unmodified CD 155, such as an unmodified CD 155 containing the native or wild-type IgSF domain, such as IgV domain. </p>Methods for determining binding affinity or avidity are known in art. See, for example, Larsen et al., American Journal of Transplantation, Vol 5: 443-453 (2005). In some embodiments, a variant CD155 of the invention (i.e. a CD155 protein containing an affinity modified IgSF domain) specifically binds to TIGIT, CD226, and/or CD96 measured by flow cytometry with a binding affinity that yields a Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) value at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or 100% greater than a wild-type CD155 control in a binding assay. \n\n [0074] The term \"biological half-life\" refers to the amount of time it takes for a substance, such as an immunomodulatory polypeptide comprising a variant CD 155 of the present invention, to lose half of its pharmacologic or physiologic activity or concentration. Biological half-life can be affected by elimination, excretion, degradation (e.g., enzymatic) of the substance, or absorption and concentration in certain organs or tissues of the body. In some embodiments, biological half-life can be assessed by determining the time it takes for the blood plasma concentration of the substance to reach half its steady state level (\"plasma half-life\"). Conjugates that can be used to derivatize and increase the biological half-life of polypeptides of the invention are known in the art and include, but are not limited to, polyethylene glycol (PEG), hydroxyethyl starch (HES), XTEN (extended recombinant peptides; see, WO2013130683), human serum albumin (HSA), bovine serum albumin (BSA), lipids (acylation), and poly-Pro-Ala-Ser (PAS), polyglutamic acid (glutamylation). </p> [0075] The term \"chimeric antigen receptor\" or \"CAR\" as used herein refers to an artificial (i.e., man-made) transmembrane protein expressed on a mammalian cell comprising at least an ectodomain, a transmembrane, and an endodomain. Optionally, the CAR protein includes a \"spacer\" which covalently links the ectodomain to the transmembrane domain. A spacer is often a polypeptide linking the ectodomain to ",
    "ypeptide control of at least about 5%, such as at least about \n\n 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 35%, or 50% for the TIGIT, CD226, and/or CD96. In some embodiments, the increase in binding affinity relative to the wild-type or unmodified CD 155 polypeptide is more than 1.2-fold, 1.5-fold, 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, 5-fold, 6-fold, 7-fold, 8-fold, 9- fold, 10-fold, 20-fold, 30-fold 40-fold or 50-fold. In such examples, the wild-type or unmodified CD 155 polypeptide has the same sequence as the variant CD 155 polypeptide except that it does not contain the one or more amino acid modifications (e.g. substitutions). </p> [0155] In some embodiments, a variant CD 155 polypeptide with reduced or decreased binding affinity to TIGIT, CD226, and/or CD96 will have decrease in binding affinity relative to the wild-type or unmodified CD155 polypeptide control of at least 5%, such as at least about 10%, 15%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or more for the TIGIT, CD226, and/or CD96. In some embodiments, the decrease in binding affinity relative to the wild-type or unmodified CD155 polypeptide is more than 1.2-fold, 1.5-fold, 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, 5-fold, 6- fold, 7-fold, 8-fold, 9-fold, 10-fold, 20-fold, 30-fold 40-fold or 50-fold. In such examples, the wild-type or unmodified CD 155 polypeptide has the same sequence as the variant CD 155 polypeptide except that it does not contain the one or more amino acid modifications (e.g. </p>substitutions). </p> [0156] In some embodiments, the equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) of any of the foregoing embodiments to TIGIT, CD226, and/or CD96 can be less than lxlO<sup>\"5</sup> M, IxlO<sup>-6</sup> M, IxlO<sup>-7</sup> M, IxlO<sup>-8</sup> M, lxlO<sup>\"9</sup> M, lxlO<sup>\"10</sup> M or lxl0<sup>\"u</sup>M, or IxlO<sup>\"12</sup> M or less. </p> [0157] The wild-type or unmodified CD 155 sequence does not necessarily have to be used as a starting composition to generate variant CD 155 polypeptides described herein. Therefore, use of the term \"modification\", such as \"substitution\" does not imply that the present embodiments are limited to a particular method of making variant CD155 polypeptides. Variant CD155 polypeptides can be made, for example, by de novo peptide synthesis and thus does not necessarily require a modification, such as a \"substitution\" in the sense of altering a codon to encode for the modification, e.g. substitution. This principle also extends to the terms \"addition\" and \"deletion\" of an amino acid residue which likewise do not imply a particular method of making. The means by which the variant CD 155 polypeptides are designed or created is not limited to any particular method. In some embodiments, however, a wild-type or unmodified CD 155 encoding nucleic acid is mutagenized from wild-type or unmodified CD 155 genetic material and screened for desired specific binding affinity and/or induction of IFN-gamma expression or other functional activity. In some embodiments, a variant CD 155 polypeptide i"
