    "-9, 2005). Briefly, the lumen and half areas were determined by measuring the length of the internal elastic sheet (LEI) and the length of the external elastic sheet (LEE) by digitized images. The pixel values between the sheets were converted into an area by calculating their ratio. The average area was obtained by LEI-LEE. The lumen area was represented by the area limited by the LEI. The lumen-average ratio was calculated from the lumen area / average area ratio. The average thickness was calculated by (LEE diameter - LEI diameter) / 2. Collagen content evaluation. Collagen was determined by performing a morphometric analysis of collagen. In sections of the left ventricle, kidney, blood vessels and / or brain of 5 Dm thick, they were cut and stained with picrosyrie red, as described in Jalil and cois (Circ. Res. 64: 1041-50, 1989). The cuts were observed through a light microscope connected to a computer, in which the images were captured through the Video Player program with an increase of 20Ox and the result was quantified semi-automatically by a software built in  our laboratory in Math Lab and previously validated (Ocaranza y cois, J. Cardiovasc.</p>Pharmacol 40: 246-54, 2002). </p>Evaluation of fibroblast content and determination of cell proliferation.</p>The blood vessels, kidney, lung, brain and / or heart were dehydrated at room temperature and embedded in paraffin. Sections of 5 Dm were immunostained with antibodies against nuclear antigen of proliferating cells KI-67 (Ocaranza et al., Am. J. Physiol. 286: H498-506, 2004). To determine the type of cells with positive staining, serial cuts were made and stained with antibodies against vimentin (fibroblasts), anti skeletal G-actin (SKA, myocytes), anti von Willebrand factor (endothelial cells) and anti vimentin, anti D - smooth muscle actin (smooth muscle cells). Biotinylated antibodies conjugated to peroxidase were used for the detection reaction and the sections were contratified with hematoxylin.</p>Evaluation of cytoprotection, apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy.</p>Apoptosis was determined by DNA fragmentation. This was done by the TUNNEL technique and by analysis on 2% agarose gels of purified DNA. The procedures described were used (Galvez and cois, CeIl Tissue Res. 304: 279-85, 2001; Ibe and cois Eur. J. Heart Fail. 9: 160-7, 2007). A greater apoptosis was evidenced by a greater number of stained (positive) cells under the microscope in the TUNNEL technique while in the agarose gels a greater amount of DNA fragments between 200 and 1000 bp than the controls were observed. Necrosis was determined by the release of lactic dehydrogenase into the extracellular environment (Parra et al., Cardiovasc. Res. 77: 387-97, 2008). Autophagy was determined by the fragmentation of the LC3 protein and by the presence of autophagic vesicles (Wohlgemuth et al., Rejuvenation Res. 10: 281-92, 2007). The cytoprotection was determined by morphometric analysis of the tissues stained with eosin and vis"
