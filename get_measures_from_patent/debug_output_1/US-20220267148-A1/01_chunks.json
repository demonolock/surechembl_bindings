Facility and Process for Preparing the Material According to the InventionI.1. Example 1 of a Facility and Process for Preparing the Material According to the InventionA particular example of a facility implemented to prepare an oxidatively active material according to the invention is described in FIG. 1a. </p>This facility is comprised of an ozoniser (1), a reactor (2), a filter (3) and an ozone scavenger (4). The 3 valves (V1), (V2), (V3) allow the gas to be directed or not to the reactor. The process parameters are monitored using various sensors, some of which are connected to displays: a gas flow meter (ball rotameter (F1)) placed at the outlet of the ozone scavenger, a temperature probe (T1) at the inlet of the reactor, a temperature probe (T2) at the outlet of the reactor, and an ozone analyser (A1) placed between the filter and the scavenger.</p>The synthesis of the material of interest is done by direct gas/solid reaction between cyclodextrins and a gaseous dioxygen/ozone (O<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>3</sub>) mixture. Cyclodextrins used in the following experimental section are \u03b2-cyclodextrin (\u03b2-CD, supplied by Sigma-Aldrich, manufactured by Wacker Chemie AG, Burghausen, Germany, Life Science, batch BCBG7824V, 98, 6% pure) and (2-h",
    "is controlled by the thermostatic bath (3). The temperature range of the experiments carried out with this facility is between 7 and 77\u00b0 C.</p>Once the ozone concentration on the analyser (A1) and the temperature (T1) are stable and in accordance with the desired values, the gas leaving the ozoniser is directed to the reactor by closing valve (V7) and opening valves (V6) and (V8). In the experiments carried out, the gas flow rate can be variable, and varied from 33 to 723 Normal litres per hour (Nl/h) with the flow meters (F1) and (F2). The contacting time of the powder with the ozone-containing gas can also be variable, ranging from 0.5 to 6 h for these experiments.</p>When the desired reaction time is reached, the valves are positioned so that the gas leaving the ozoniser is directed to the scavenger. The reactor is then taken off from the support and the sintered parts are removed.</p>The material obtained at the end of the synthesis is a fine powder, resembling, to the naked eye, the material prior to the process according to the invention.</p>The ozone-treated powder is then recovered and stored in a glass vial or shaped (in the form of a pellet, for example).</p>II. Characterisation of the Material According to the Present InventionII.1. Characterisations and AssaysCharacterisation tests (thermogravimetric analysis coupled with a differential calorimetric analysis, Infrared spectroscopy . . . ) and assays (potassium iodide/sodium thiosulphate assay\u2014assay method called \u201cKI method\u201d or \u201cKI test\u201d\u2014allowing the amount of ozone contained in the powder to be determined) have been carried out on some of the materials.</p>Note that dissolving native cyclodextrins (commercial product) in a KI solution does not produce any staining of the solution (negative KI test). Only the cyclodextrins reacted with ozone obtained according to the process of the invention have a \u201cpositive\u201d KI test: the solution becomes yellow/orange as illustrated in FIG. 2.</p>II.2. Detailed Protocol for Biological TestsThe purpose of the microbiological tests is to verify the biocidal effect of the material according to the present invention and thus to evaluate its potential for use in crop protection for example.</p>II.2.1. Protocol AArtificial supports are first placed in Petri dishes (2 dishes/modality tested) without agar medium and then inoculated with a solution of micro-organisms (fungi or bacteria), for example conidia of Venturia inaequalis, the fungus responsible for apple scab. These supports are then placed in an incubation chamber for 24 hours in order to initiate development of the micro-organisms.</p>Treatments with a material according to the present invention are applied by sprinkling (0.1 g/dish) 24 h after the beginning of germination.</p>After approximately one hour of contacting the micro-organisms with the material, the artificial supports are moved to an agar medium (Patato Dextrose Agar) in order to ensure the nutrient supply necessary for the proper development of the micro-organisms. The inoculated Petri dishes treated are then placed in an air-conditioned chamber (12 h/12 h day/night cycle, night temperature: 8\u00b0 C., day temperature: 17\u00b0 C.).</p>From the 3rd day of incubation, regular observations and counts are carried out in order to evaluate and compare the different modalities.</p>II.2.2.

It can be seen that the solution gradually recolourises yellow again after the end of the assay. The indicated value is therefore probably underestimated if recolouring is due to a gradual release of stabilised ozone into the liquid phase. Organised structures in the solution are clearly visible under the microscope: it is possible that cyclodextrins in solution stabilise some ozone, which hence does not react immediately during the assay.</p>II.3.4. Test Run No. 4Synthesis of the Materials According to the Invention:</p>The syntheses have been carried out with \u03b1-cyclodextrin (\u03b1-CD), \u03b2-cyclodextrin (\u03b2-CD), \u03b3-cyclodextrin (\u03b3-CD), (2-hydroxypropyl)-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP-\u03b2-CD), Sulfobutylether-\u03b2-Cyclodextrin (SBE-\u03b2-CD) and a cyclodextrin polymer (\u03b2-CD polymer) according to process example 2 (point I.2. above).</p>The operating conditions for these tests are summarised in Table 4 below. Notations are: Tr (reactor temperature); [O<sub>3</sub>]g supply: ozone concentration in the supply gas; Q=gas flow rate; t<sub>s</sub>=synthesis time; m=mass of powder introduced into the reactor; [O<sub>3</sub>]<sub>p</sub>=amount of stored ozone obtained by KI volumetric assay; Pre-treatment: pre-treatment of the powder before reaction; Ozoniser supply=nature of the supply gas to the ozoniser.</p>TABLE 4Operating conditions of syntheses during tests No4[O3]<sub>g</sub>TrsupplyQPre-OzoniserMean\u03c3Mean\u03c3Mean\u03c3t<sub>s</sub>m[O3]<sub>p</sub>\u0394<sub>[O3]P</sub>Producttreatmentsupply\u00b0 C.g/Nm<sup>3</sup>Nl/hhgMg<sub>O3</sub>/g<sub>product</sub>///25.60.2771185321.051.470.17\u03b1-CDnoneO225.10.3765186521.070.990.15\u03b2-CDnoneO225.40.1761186721.055.710.31HP-\u03b2-noneO2CD25.70.1771185321.020.260.13SBE-\u03b2-noneO2CD25.30.1781182421.025.440.31\u03b2-CD-noneO2Polymer25.10.1771188321.010.910.15\u03b3-CDnoneO2</p>Under identical operating conditions, it is noted that the ozone storage capacity is strongly dependent on the nature of the CD used for the synthesis, the best results being obtained with HP-\u03b2-CD and the \u03b2-CD polymer.</p>Evaluation of the Biocidal Character of a Material Thus Prepared on Several Bacterial and Fungal StrainsThe results are summarised in Table 5 below.</p>TABLE 5Biocidal character of the material according to the inventionPathogensBiological efficacyFungiP.min 110.712ConfirmedP.min 100.398(spores unable to grow P.ch 239.74after 5 days incubation)BacteriaE.coliConfirmedS.uberis(Growth arrest)</p>Concerning the fungal strains, the control dishes exhibit an uncountable number of micro-organisms (carpet-like appearance). On the other hand, dishes that received oxidising \u03b2-CDs, that are prepared according to the process of the invention, are largely sparser or completely free of mycelial spots. At 100-fold dilution, the control agar media still contain numerous mycelial starts (on average 990/ml deposited) whereas the agar media that have received oxidising \u03b2-CDs, that are prepared according to the process of the invention, no longer contain any for the strains P. min 100.398 and P. ch. 239.74. Only a few mycelial starts are visible for the strain P. min 110.712, which seems to be a little less sensitive. The fungicidal effect is therefore confirmed.</p>As far as the bacterial strains are concerned, the addition of oxidising \u03b2-CDs, that are prepared according to the process of the invention, stops development of the bacteria in both cases, whereas the controls continue growing during the hours of analysis. Again, it can be concluded that the newly obtained material has a bactericidal effect.</p>II.3.5. Stability of the Material According to the Present InventionIn order to test the stability of the material according to the present invention, a synthesis has been carried out with \u03b2-CD and a contacting time with ozone of 2 h (according to process example 1 of point I.1. above). The batch of powder at the end of the synthesis has been stored at 6\u00b0 C. (open vial).</p>FIG. 5 sets forth a series of KI tests performed on the powder at different storage times (1 day, 2 days, 5 days and 6 days). A yellow colour can be seen for all samples containing \u03b2-CD subjected to the process according to the invention, to be compared with the transparent colour of KI alone (left-hand vial) or KI with \u03b2-CD before the reaction (second vial from the left).</p>This stability test has been repeated with the ozone-treated HP-\u03b2-CD according to process example 2 (section I.2. below) under the following conditions: synthesis time=6 h; ozone concentration in supply gas=69\u00b118 g<sub>O3</sub>/Nm<sup>3</sup>; gas flow rate=335 \u00b17 Nl/h; reactor temperature=27.1\u00b0 C.\u00b10.5\u00b0 C. The material was packaged in closed glass vials. The stability of the material has been evaluated over a period of 65 days under different temperature conditions: under ambient conditions at a mean temperature of 21\u00b0 C.\u00b12\u00b0 C.; in a refrigerator at a mean temperature of 2\u00b0 C.\u00b12\u00b0 C., and in a freezer at a mean temperature of \u221219\u00b0 C.\u00b12\u00b0 C. The ozone concentration in the material has been evaluated by volumetric assay (\u201cKI method\u201d).</p>The results of the course of ozone mass concentration in the material over time for the 3 storage temperatures tested (\u221219\u00b0 C., 2\u00b0 C. and 21\u00b0 C.) are set forth in FIG. 6.</p>It can therefore be concluded that the material prepared according to the present invention stabilises ozone, thus keeping its oxidative properties at a minimum for several weeks. It should be noted that the lower the storage temperature, the more stable the material. For example, the ozone mass loss rate (calculated as 100\u00d7[1\u2212(C/C<sub>0</sub>)], where C is the ozone mass concentration at time t and C<sub>0 </sub>is the initial ozone mass concentration) is less than 20% after 65 days of storage if the material is kept at a temperature of \u221219\u00b0 C.</p>In further tests with HP-\u03b2-CD stored at ambient temperature for 33 days, it has also been shown that the stability of the material over time was not affected by either primary vacuum conditioning or conditioning under 3.5\u00b10.2 bar absolute CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>II.3.6. Ozone Storage By the Material According to the Present InventionIn order to validate ozone storage in the material according to the invention, two tests have been carried out with HP-\u03b2-CD treated according to process example 2 (point I.2. above).</p>First Test:</p>In the first test, about 1.5 g of ozone storage material in powder form have been placed in a glass cup, which in turn has been placed in a glass reactor of volume 1.4 litres. The reactor can be hermetically closed and has b",
    " targeted applications (see biological tests).</p>Hypothesising that ozone molecules are encapsulated within the material, the ozone concentrations obtained by assay are very high (100 to 1000 times those obtained with ozonated water). This concentration depends on several parameters, including the nature and properties of the CD.</p>The storage capacity of the material is highly dependent on the CD used as raw material. The best results have been obtained with HP-\u03b2-CD (a modified \u03b2-CD much more soluble in aqueous phase than simple \u03b2-CD) for which an ozone concentration equal to 5700\u00b1100 \u03bcg/g powder (three assays performed) has been found with process example 1 and 11540\u00b1540 g/g powder (three assays performed) with process example 2 (point I.2. above). These values are equivalent to a concentration about 400 and 800 times higher than for ozonated water at ambient temperature and pressure ([O<sub>3</sub>] ozonated water, 25\u00b0 C., 1 bar, at 60-80 g/Nm<sup>3 </sup>(pH=7) about 14 mg/L water), respectively.</p>It has also been shown that the material maintains its oxidative properties for several months, even with rudimentary storage under ambient conditions (temperature of about 21\u00b0 C. under air). Nevertheless, the ozone concentration in the material stored under ambient conditions (temperature of about 25-30\u00b0 C. and synthesis process example 1) decreases over time: the estimated loss is about 20% per day as regards the \u201cimmediate\u201d assay of the powder (first decolourising of the KI solution). Measurements carried out with powders synthesized with process example 2 and stored at different temperatures show that low storage temperatures (2\u00b0 C., \u221219\u00b0 C.) allow ozone loss to be limited over time, the best results being obtained with the lowest storage temperature tested (that is \u221219\u00b0 C.).</p>Furthermore, the assay results could also suggest that the solid, once dissolved in water, stabilises some of the ozone, initially contained in the material, within the liquid solution which gradually recolours over time. Predicted concentrations and kinetics could thus be underestimated as compared to reality.</p>REFERENCES[1] McTurk &amp; Waller, 1964, \u201cOzone carbon tetrachloride double hydrate\u201d, Nature, vol. 202, page 1107.</p>2] Nakagima et al, 2012, \u201cMolecular storage of ozone in a clathrate hydrate: an attempt for preserving ozone at high concentrations\u201d, PlosOne, vol. 7: e48563.</p>3] Patent application JP 2007/210881 on behalf of Kurita Water Ind.
