Measurement was performed in a reaction volume of 15. Mu.L by adding 5. Mu.L of test compound, 5. Mu.L of factor B/antibody mixture and 5. Mu.L of tracer were added to a white opaque 384 well assay plate. The TR-FRET signal is read on a plate reader with excitation wavelength 340nm and detection wavelengths 615 and 665 nm. The binding affinity of each compound was determined by measuring the TR-FRET signal for the compound at different concentrations and plotting the relative fluorescence emission ra",

Immobilization and binding experiments were performed at room temperature. </p>After the buffer was changed to 1 XPBS-P+ buffer containing 2% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, a pre-run was performed at a flow rate of 30. Mu.l/min for at least 30 minutes to obtain a stable surface. The kinetic constant of the compound is determined by the single cycle kinetics of six consecutive injections (or the multiple cycle kinetics of eight consecutive injections), and depending on potency, the compound concentration increases in the range of 0.8-200nM, 12.5-400nM, 4.1-1000nM, or 41-10000 nM. The single cycle kinetics experiments were performed with an association time of 60s and a dissociation time of 300s per concentration (or 120s for the multiple cycle kinetics experiments). The flow rate was 30. Mu.l/min. Prior to injection of the compound, a blank test was performed under the same conditions.</p>SPR sensor maps were analyzed by double reference using Biacore Insight Evaluation software. The resulting curves were fitted with a 1:1 binding model. Compounds bound according to the induction fitting model were fitted with a bi-state reaction model. The repeated kinetic constants (k <sub>on</sub>,k<sub>off</sub>,K<sub>D</sub>) were averaged. The binding half-life (t 1/2) of the 1:1 binding model and the bimodal reaction model was calculated from the dissociation constant koff, with the formula t <sub>1/2</sub>\uff1dln2/k<sub>off</sub>.

Ocular tissues and plasma of both eyes were collected from rats at each time point at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 6 and 24 hours after dosing. The eye tissue collected was the retina and posterior eye cup (RPE/choroid and posterior sclera). The tissue was diluted with phosphate buffered saline containing 10% acetonitrile, homogenized and centrifuged prior to analysis. At each time point, the concentration of the test sample in plasma and in the ocular homogenate supernatant in four separate retinas, four separate posterior eye cups and two separate plasma samples was measured by HPLC-MS/MS. The chromatographic separation was carried out on a Waters BEH C18 column (2.1X10 mm,1.7 \u03bcm) column (MAC-MOD Analytical, chadds-Ford, p"
