    "re recorded isometrically (Grass FTO3 transducer). Following an initial loading tension of 1 g, the tissues were stimulated with electrical pulses at a frequency of 0.1 Hz and a pulse duration of 0.5 msec, as described by Kosterlitz &amp; Watt (Br. J. Pharmacol. 1968, 266276). Initially, the tissues were stimulated at supramaximal (1.3 fold times maximal) voltage for a period of 30 min and then the tissues were washed and re-stimulated. A \u201csighter dose\u201d of the selective histamine H<sub>3</sub>-receptor agonist, R-(\u03b1)-methylhistamine (0.3 \u03bcM) (Arrang et al. Nature, 1987, 117-123), was administered. Upon generation of response, the \u201csighter dose\u201d was removed from the tissues by \u201cwashout\u201d (6 washes over 60 min) and during this period the electrical stimulation was switched off. The tissues were then re-stimulated and allowed to stabilise prior to the addition of drug treatments, which were allocated on a randomised block basis to the organ baths. Following the incubation period, a single cumulative E/[A] curve was obtained. The experimental E/[A] curve data was expressed as the percentage inhibition of the peak height of electrically-stimulated contraction. Antagonist affinity values were calculated from the degree of rightward shift of the R-(\u03b1)-methylhistamine E/[A] curves using Schild's methods (Arunlakshana &amp; Schild Br. J. Pharmacol. 1959, 48-58). Typical variance in this assay is \u00b10.15 log units.</p>The compounds of the invention were also tested in a guinea pig cortex binding assay, as follows:</p>Histamine H<sub>3 </sub>Radioligand Binding Assay\u2014Guinea Pig Cortex</p>Preparation of Membranes</p>Male Dunkin Hartley guinea pigs (200-300 g) were used. The whole brain was removed and immediately placed in ice-cold 20 mM Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH7.4 at 21\u00b13\u00b0 C.). The cortex was dissected, weighed and homogenised in ice-cold 20 mM Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH7.4 at 21\u00b13\u00b0 C.) (50 ml/guinea-pig cortex) using a polytron (Kinematica AG; PT-DA 3020/2TS, 3\u00d73 s). The homogenate was centrifuged at 100\u00d7g for 5 min and the supernatants pooled and stored at 4\u00b0 C. The pellets were rehomogenised in fresh ice-cold buffer (80 ml) and recentrifuged (100\u00d7g for 5 min). The supernatants were pooled and pellets rehomogenised and recentrifuged (100\u00d7g for 5 min). All supernatants were pooled and centrifuged at 39,800\u00d7g for 12 min at 4\u00b0 C. The final pellet was resuspended in 20 mM Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH7.4 at 21\u00b13\u00b0 C.) to a tissue concentration of 7.5 mg.ml<sup>\u22121</sup>, using a teflon-in-glass homogeniser.</p>Incubation Conditions</p>Guinea pig cortex membranes (400 \u03bcl) were incubated for 165 min at 21\u00b13\u00b0 C. in a final volume of 500 \u03bcl with 20 mM Hepes-NaOH buffer containing [<sup>3</sup>H]-R-\u03b1-methylhistamine (50 \u03bcl; 1 nM) and competing compound. Total and non-specific binding of [<sup>3</sup>H]-R-\u03b1-methylhistamine were defined using 50 \u03bcl of buffer and 50 \u03bcl of 10 \u03bcM thioperamide, respectively. The assay was terminated by rapid filtration through Whatman GF/B filters, presoaked (2 hr) in 0.1% polyethyleneimine, using a Brandell Cell Harvester. The filters were washed (3\u00d73 ml) with ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH6.9 at 21\u00b13\u00b0 C.), transferred into scintillation vials, 5 ml liquid scintillation cocktail was added and after 4 hours the bound radioactivity was determined by counting (4 min) in a Beckman liquid scintillation counter.</p>Data Analysis</p>Data are analysed using GraphPad prism and the general equation for a competition curve with variable Hill slope (n<sub>H</sub>). \nY=Non\u2062-\u2062specific\u2062\u2003\u2062binding+(Total\u2062\u2003\u2062binding-Non\u2062-\u2062specific\u2062\u2003\u2062binding)1+10((log\u2062\u2003\u2062I\u2062\u2003\u2062C50-X)\u00b7nH)\n\nwhere\nX is the log concentration of competing compound,Y is the binding obtained at each concentration of X,pIC<sub>50 </sub>is the concentration of the competitor required to compete for half of the specific binding.\n</p>The IC<sub>50 </sub>is converted to the K<sub>1 </sub>using the Cheng Prusoff equation,\n\nK<sub>1</sub>=IC<sub>50</sub>/(1+(L/K<sub>D</sub>)) \n\nwhere\nIC<sub>50 </sub>is the concentration of competitor required to compete for half the specific binding,L is the radioligand concentration used,K<sub>D </sub>is the equilibrium dissociation constant for the radioligand determined by saturation experiments.\n</p>The results obtained from the functional and binding assays described above are set out in the Table below:</p>TABLEpK<sub>i</sub>pK<sub>b</sub>Example(Guinea pig cortex)(Guinea pig ileum)17.25.427.36.437.16.147.16.557.06.167.36.477.46.487.76.298.36.5107.66.5117.46.3126.26.3137.76.3147.66.0156.1NT166.25.4178.37.3188.37.3197.36.0209.06.7217.36.8227.16.7236.55.5248.26.2258.17.1267.46.8276.8NT287.56.7298.47.7308.57.9318.48.0328.58.0337.16.7346.56.5358.17.7367.37.2377.97.6387.57.2397.4NT408.47.4418.97.5427.66.4437.06.7448.87.6458.47.5468.57.7478.47.3488.57.6498.27.5507.86.5518.17.0526.56.5538.17.1547.37.1557.56.6567.77.2577.7NT588.56.7598.07.0608.08.1618.17.8627.57.4637.77.4647.26.2658.37.1668.67.4678.67.3688.17.3699.07.9708.38.4718.78.4728.38.5738.87.8748.17.9757.66.9768.88.1778.28.0787.17.5798.1808.0816.95.9826.56.0836.66.2846.36.1856.8NT865.6NT875.9NT886.25.9897.06.2905.9NT916.96.3925.7NT935.5NT945.6NT955.8NT965.8NT975.85.5986.16.1996.76.51006.76.31016.66.01027.26.51036.96.51046.46.41056.46.31066.06.21077.06.81085.8NT1096.7NT1106.35.61115.8NT1126.45.81137.06.71146.57.01156.36.41166.96.71177.1NT1185.8NT1197.85.71206.36.31216.56.01226.96.51236.65.51245.9NT1256.5&lt;5.5\u2009\u20091266.05.51275.75.71285.5NT1296.1NT1305.3NT1316.0&lt;5.5\u2009\u20091326.95.81335.6&lt;5.5\u2009\u20091346.0NT1356.56.21366.56.51375.6NT1385.9NT1396.76.31408.16.51416.66.31426.25.71436.15.5NT = not tested </p>"
