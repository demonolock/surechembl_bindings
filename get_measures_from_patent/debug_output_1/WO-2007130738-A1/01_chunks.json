    "ugh the VCA production in Daudi cells using an ELISA assay. Superinfection was initiated by the incubation of 0.5 ml of an appropriate concentration of EBV with 10<sup>6</sup> cells/tube in a total of 1 ml/tube. In most cases this amounts to a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1-0.2 based on VCA induction in Daudi cells. After adsorption at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr, 3 ml of RPM 1-1640 medium was added. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation and supematants discarded. Sophorolipids in varying concentration in 4 ml of RPMM 640 was added to the appropriate tubes. RPM M 640 was added to positive and negative control tubes. Daudi cells infected with P3HR-1 virus and treated with the drug were \n\nharvested by centrifugation and washed three times with PBS. The cells were pelleted and suspended to a concentration of 4 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml in PBS. 100 \u03bcl of each suspension was dispensed in triplicate into a 96-well plate, air-dried and fixed with 95% Ethanol and 5% Acetic Acid. Uninfected cells were prepared in the same manner and used as controls. After washing the plate, primary and secondary antibodies diluted in 1 % bovine serum albumin containing 0.05% Tween-20 were added sequentially to each well and incubated at room temperature. Antibody additions were separated by 3 washes with PBS containing 0.005% Tween-20. O-phenyldiamine (OPD) substrate was added and the reaction stopped with 3N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> after ~10 min. The optical density was measured at 492 nm and the EC50 extrapolated using a computer software program.</p>\n  Table 1 Compound Name Drug Unit ECso</p>\n  Ethyl ester di acetate uM &gt;100</p>\n  Ethyl ester uM &lt;0.03 Di-acetate lactonic uM 25.8</p>\n  SL acid uM 49.2 Methyl ester uM 18.4</p>\n  As shown in Table 1 , in which the anti-herpes virus activity of various forms of sophorolipids (with results expressed as EC50), all five tested compounds displayed some degree of anti-herpes virus activity. The best activity was displayed by Ethyl 17-L-[(2<sup>'</sup>-0-\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyl-\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyl)-oxy]-cis- 9-octadecenoate, which showed high activity. Accordingly, the results of the assay show that natural mixtures of lactonic, non-lactonic, ethyl, methyl esters of sophorolipids and 6',6\"-diacetate ethyl sophorolipids can act as an anti-herpes virus agents.</p>\n  Thus, the invention is a method for treating a herpes-related viral infection in a subject comprising the step of administering an effective amount of at least \n\none sophorolipid to the subject. Preferably, the sophorolipid is 17-L-[(2'-O-\u03b2-D- glucopyranosyl- \u03b2-D-glucopyranosyl)-oxy]-cis-9-octadecenoate based and is produced by Candida bombicola.</p>\n  In use, the at least one sophorolipid is administered to the subject in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Preferably, the administration is by a method selected from the group consisting of intraperitoneal administration, intraarterial administration, and intravenous administration. Further, the sophorolipid is administered in a dose of between about 2 mg of the mixture per kilogram of the human or animal and about 30 mg of the mixture per kilogram of the human or animal.</p>\n  The invention also is method for treating a herpes-related viral infection in a subject comprising the step of administering an effective amount of at least one sophorolipid to the subject, wherein"
