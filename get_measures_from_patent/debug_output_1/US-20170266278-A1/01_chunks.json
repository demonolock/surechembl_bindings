    "rse a symptom of a disorder or disease. For example, administration of therapeutic agents to a patient suffering from cancer provides a therapeutic benefit not only when the underlying condition is eradicated or ameliorated, but also when the patient reports a decrease in the severity or duration of the symptoms associated with the disease, e.g., a decrease in tumor burden, a decrease in circulating tumor cells, an increase in progression free survival. Therapeutic benefit also includes halting or slowing the progression of the underlying disease or disorder, regardless of whether improvement is realized.</p>Effective amounts, toxicity, and therapeutic efficacy can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to about 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in about 50% of the population). The dosage can vary depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. In some embodiments, compositions and methods that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. A therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from in vitro assays, including, for example, cell culture assays. Also, a dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 as determined in cell culture, or in an appropriate animal model. Levels of the described compositions in plasma can be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography. The effects of any particular dosage can be monitored by a suitable bioassay. The dosage can be determined by a physician and adjusted, as necessary, to suit observed effects of the treatment.</p>In certain embodiments, the effect will result in a quantifiable change of at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 50%, at least about 70%, or at least about 90%. In some embodiments, the effect will result in a quantifiable change of about 10%, about 20%, about 30%, about 50%, about 70%, or even about 90% or more. Therapeutic benefit also includes halting or slowing the progression of the underlying disease or disorder, regardless of whether improvement is realized.</p>In certain embodiments, a pharmacologically effective amount that will treat cancer will modulate the symptoms typically by at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, or at least about 50%. In illustrative embodiments, such modulations will result in, for example, statistically significant and quantifiable changes in the numbers of cancerous cells.</p>This invention is further illustrated by the following non-limiting examples.</p>EXAMPLESExample 1: Preparation of the Model VaccineAlum adjuvant (IMJECT ALUM, THERMO) was used in combination with CBLB502 to chal"
