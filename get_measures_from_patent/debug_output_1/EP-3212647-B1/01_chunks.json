Cellular TestingIn order to test the cellular inhibitory potency of compounds, the level of global trimethylation at lysine 4 on histone H3 was assessed by immunoblot analysis in a human osteosarcoma U2-OS cell line stably overexpressing KDM5B.</p>U2-OS cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 2.5 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well in 3mL McCoy's 5A medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen Gibco, USA) and incubated overnight. A KDM5B-expression plasmid tagged with Myc-DDK (Origene, USA) was transfected into the cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight hours after the transfection, the cells were diluted to 1:100 for passage and neomycin-resistant clones were selected in the presence of 600 \u00b5g/ml G418 (Gibco BRL, USA) for 2 weeks. The positive clones were picked up and expanded individually for 2 weeks. The expression of KDM5B in each clone was verified by immunoblot analysis, and the clones overexpressing KDM5B were subsequently maintained in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 300 \u00b5g/ml G418at 37\u00b0C in an atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>For assays of compounds, U2-OS cells stably overexpressing KDM5B were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 1.0 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well in 1mL of McCoy's 5A medium without G418. The cells were incubated for 24 hours before the addition of compounds. The com",

The extract was centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 10 minutes, and the supernatants were recovered. The protein concentration was quantitated using BCA Protein Assay (Pierce, USA) and SoftMax pro software version 5.2 (Molecular Device, USA). After denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 minutes, the total proteins (20 \u00b5g of protein/lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE on4\u223c12% gradient gels (Invitrogen, USA). The resolved proteins were transferred onto a 0.45-\u00b5m nitrocellulose membrane by wet electroblotting for 1 hour, and then the membrane was soaked inTris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.05% Tween-20(TBS-T) for 1 hour at room temperature. The membrane was incubated with 1:2000 H3K4me3 antibodies (ab8580; Abcam) and 1:10000 H3 antibodies (ab1791; Abcam) overnight at 4\u00b0C. The membrane was washed with TBS-T three times for 30 min and then incubated with 1:5000 or 1:20000 anti-rabbit secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature. Protein bands of interest were visualized by chemiluminescence (Amersham ECL prime Western Blotting Detection Reagents; GE Healthcare Lifesciences, USA). Each protein band image was acquired by a Molecular Imager ChemiDoc XRS System (Bio-Rad, USA) and quantified by using Quantity One software (ver4.6.7). The normalized level of tri-methylation was determined by dividing an H3K4me3 band intensity by a corresponding</p>H3 band intensity and half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) was calculated using Sigma Plot.Results are seen in Table 3.\nTable 3No.Chemical NameIC<sub>50</sub>152-((4-benzylphenoxy)methyl)pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4(3H)-one+462-chloro-5-((4-oxo-3,4-dihydropyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidin-2-yl)methoxy)-N-(2-(piperidin-4-yl)ethyl)benzamide+492-chloro-N-((1-methylpiperidin-4-yl)methyl)-5-((4-oxo-3,4-dihydropyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidin-2-yl)methoxy)benzamide+50N-((1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)methyl)-2-chloro-5-((4-oxo-3,4-dihydropyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidin-2-yl)methoxy)benzamide+69methyl 2-chloro-5-((4-oxo-3,4-dihydropyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidin-2-yl)methoxy)benzoate+928-((((1-methylpyrrolidin-3-yl)methyl)amino)methyl)pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4(3H)-one+958-((((1-methylpiperidin-4-yl)methyl)amino)methyl)pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4(3H)-one++968-((((1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)methyl)amino)methyl)pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4(3H)-one+98(R)-8-(((piperidin-3-ylmethyl)amino)methyl)pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4(3H)-one+99(S)-8-(((piperidin-3-ylmethyl)amino)methyl)pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4(3H)-one+++1008-((((1-methylpiperidin-3-yl)methyl)amino)methyl)pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4(3H)-one+1058-((((1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)methyl)amino)methyl)-2-((2-chlorophenoxy)methyl)pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4(3H)-one+++1068-((((1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)methyl)amino)methyl)-2-((3-chlorophenoxy)methyl)pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4(3H)-one+++1078-((((1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)methyl)amino)methyl)-2-((4-chlorophenoxy)methyl)pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4(3H)-one+++1088-((((1-benzylpiperidi"
