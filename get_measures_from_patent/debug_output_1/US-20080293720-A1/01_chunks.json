Such affinity is typically calculated from the IC<sub>50 </sub>as the concentration of a compound necessary to inhibit 50% of the stimulated response from the receptor in an appropriate assay, and is reported as a \u201cK<sub>i</sub>\u201d value calculated by the following equation:</p>Ki=IC501+L/KD</p>where L=radioligand and K<sub>D</sub>=affinity of radioligand for receptor (Cheng and Prusoff, Biochem. Pharmacol. 22:3099, 1973).</p>In the context of the present invention pKi (corresponding to the antilogarithm of Ki) is used instead of Ki.</p>In one aspect the present invention provides compounds having a pKi comprised between 5.4 and 6.5 as derived from the assay method set out below. In another aspect the present invention provides compounds having a pKi comprised between 6.5 and 7.0 as derived from such an assay. In a further aspect the present invention provides compounds having a pKi greater than 7.0 as derived from such an assay.</p>CCR-2 [<sup>35</sup>S] GTPgS SPA Binding AssayMembrane PreparationCHO cells expressing the human CCR-2 receptor were grown in DMEM F12 media supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, G418 at 37\u00b0 C. 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Confluent cells were harvested using Hanks buffered salt solution (HBSS, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup> free) containing 0.6 mM EDTA. The resulting cell suspension was centrifuged at 300 g at 4\u00b0 C. for 10 min, cell pellet resuspended in 100 ml HBSS+EDTA and respun at 300 g for 5 min. The resulting cell pellet was resuspended in 50 mM HEPES containing 100 mM leupeptin, 25 \u03bcg/ml bacitracin, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF and 2 \u03bcM pepstain A, at pH7.4. The suspension was homogenised using an ice cold blender and centrifuged at 500 g for 20 mins. The supernatant is withdrawn and spun at 48000 g for 30 mins. This cell pellet is resuspended in the above buffer minus the pepstatin A and PMSF and stored in aliquots at \u221270\u00b0 C.</p>AssayFor the assay, membranes are thawed and resuspended in assay buffer (20 mM HEPES, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 mM NaCl, pH7.4, containing 1 mg/ml saponin, 10 mM GDP) to give final concentration of 5 \u03bcg/well. These are pre-coupled with LEADseeker SPA beads (0.25 mg/well) for 30 min at room temperature whilst mixing. Assay plates containing 0.5 \u03bcl of various test compounds (30 \u03bcM-30 pM) in 100% DMSO as 11 point, four fold dilutions across a 384 well plate are used in the assay which have been prepared on a Biomek FX. The plate also contains 16 wells of DMSO and 16 wells of a high concentration of a standard antagonist to produce high and low controls in the experiment. To this 15 \u03bcl of bead and membrane mix are added with, 15 \u03bcl [<sup>35</sup>S] GTPgS (0.2 nM final assay concentration) and 15 \u03bcl of an EC<sub>80 </sub>(40 nM) of MCP-1. This concentration of MCP-1 has been pre-determined from agonist curves run against this receptor. All additions are made using a multidrop. Plates are then sealed and centrifuged for 5 min at 300 rpm before they are left to incubate at room temperature for 3 hours. After this time they are read on a Viewlux imaging system. For data handling the high and low controls wells are used to normalise the data which is then fitted using a 4 parameter kit in Excel.</p>The assay described above is believed to have an effective limit of detection of a pKi in the region of 5.0-5.5. Accordingly, a compound exhibiting a pKi value within this range from such an assay may indeed have a reasonable affinity for the receptor, but equally it may also have a lower affinity, including a considerably lower affinity.</p>Using this assay, all of the exemplified compounds gave a pKi\u22675.0.</p>"
