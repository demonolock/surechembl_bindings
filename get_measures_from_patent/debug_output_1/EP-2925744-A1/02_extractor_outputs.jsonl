{"raw_mentions": "There are no sentences that meet the specified criteria in the provided text snippet. The text appears to be a collection of example labels and descriptions of a biological assay, but it does not contain specific molecule names, bioactivity metrics, numeric values, and units that are required to be extracted. \n\nHowever, one sentence that comes close to meeting the criteria is:\n\n\"MTH1 diluted in assay buffer (100 mM Tris-acetate, 40 mM NaCI, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM DTT and 0.005% Tween 20) fortified with E.coli pyrophosphatase (0.8 U/ml) is added to a final concentration of 4.8 nM.\"\n\nThis sentence contains a specific molecule/protein (MTH1), a numeric value (4.8), and a unit (nM), but it does not contain a bioactivity metric. \n\nAnother sentence that comes close to meeting the criteria is:\n\n\"dGTP diluted in assay buffer is added to a final concentration of 100 \u03bc\u039c.\"\n\nThis sentence contains a specific molecule (dGTP), a numeric value (100), and a unit (\u03bcM), but it does not contain a bioactivity metric.\n\nSince these sentences do not meet all the specified criteria, they are not included in the output. The output remains empty."}
