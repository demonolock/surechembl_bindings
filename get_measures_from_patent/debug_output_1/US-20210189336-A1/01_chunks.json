    " the efficacy in killing cancer target cells. For example, a very efficacious activated T cell with a 1:100 Effective E:T Ratio, that eliminates 100 target cells per activated T cell, may not be able to kill all cancer cells if that patient has a very large density of cancer target cells. Leaving alive many cancer cells would normally be considered a sign of low activity for the activated T cell in a standard chemotherapy activity measurement; in this case, it would miss the true high activity of the activated T cell generated by the bispecific T cell engager antibody (BiTE), the problem being some cancer cells are immunosuppressed and resistant to the otherwise high activity CAR activated T cells generated. Hence, the Effective E:T ratio can identify the most active activated T cells, e.g., those activated T cells better suited to be administered to the patient, and to be used as a source to transfect a CAR making a CAR-T product.</p>Alternatively, a low level of Effective E:T Ratio is indicative of a poor T cell killing activity. In one embodiment, a ratio activated T cells:target cells of 1:1 (e.g., 1, 3, or 5) is indicative of poor T cell killing activity. A subject having T cells having reduced cell killing activity can be identified as being a poor responder to the bispecific T cell engager antibody (BiTE) and/or immunomodulatory agent.</p>There are alternative approaches to estimate the activity of activated T cells, besides the Effective E:T Ratios, basal E:T Ratios, EC50, Emax, kinetics, and association of these variables. More sophisticated mathematical calculations and different ways of fitting the experimental data, using different pharmacological operational models, can provide different ways to calculate how many cancer cells are killed by a activated T cells relative to the herein proposed Effective E:T Ratio. Those alternative approaches to calculate essentially the same concept to estimate the activity of the activated T cells are also considered covered by the definition of Effective E:T Ratios.</p>In embodiments of any of the aforesaid methods or assays, the level of target cells and/or activated T cells is determined at one or more time intervals after step (c). In exemplary embodiments, the level of target cells and/or activated T cells is determined at time 0, at time 1-168 hours (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, or 168 hours) or several days or weeks after step (c).</p>In embodiments of any of the aforesaid methods or assays, the contacting step further comprises addition of a bispecific T cell engager antibody (BiTE) and/or immunomodulatory agent at different doses (e.g., increasing dosages) of the bispecific T cell engager antibody (BiTE) and/or immunomodulatory agent, e.g., to generate a dose-response curve. In one embodiment, the difference between the level of T cells or cancer cells at a dose zero or at control level (e.g., a threshold dose) and a saturated dose of the bispecific T cell engager antibody (BiTE) and/or immunomodulatory agent is determined. In embodiments, the difference in the level of T cells or cancer cells at the saturated dose vs. threshold dose is determined. In embodiments, the Effective E:T ratio as used herein is the ratio of the difference in the level of T cells relative to the difference in the level of cancer cells. In embodiments, the Effective E:T ratio as used herein is the ratio of the number of T cells and target cells at their respective EC50 concentration.</p>In embodiments of any of the aforesaid methods or assays, the method is performed using an automated platform, e.g., an automated fluorescence-based platform, e.g., the ExviTech\u00ae platform described herein.</p>In embodiments of any of the aforesaid methods or assays, the activity of the bispecific T cell engager antibody (BiTE) and/or immunomodulatory agent is determined using an ex vivo/in vitro assay to measure dose response curves, whose mathematical fitting enable quantitative parameters to estimate the activity, selected from at least one from EC50, Effective E:T ratio, basal E:T ratios, Emax or kinetics. In embodiments of any of the aforesaid methods or assays, the activity of the bispecific T cell engager antibody (BiTE) and/or immunomodulatory agent assessed by step (e) is different from an activity assessment using a dose response of the bispecific T cell engager antibody (BiTE) and/or immunomodulatory agent activity, e.g., compared to a standard depletion dose response curve.</p>In embodiments of any of the aforesaid methods or assays, the reference ratio is a predetermined ratio, e.g., about 1:3 to 1:10, e.g., about 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, 1:6, 1:7, 1:8, 1:9, or 1:10. In embodiments, the T cell to high target cell ratio from step (e) is about 1:4-1:500 (e.g., 1:4, 1:5, 1:6, 1:7, 1:8, 1:9, 1:10, 1:15, 1:20, 1:25, 1:30, 1:35, 1:40, 1:45, 1:50, 1:75, 1:100, 1:500, or higher).</p>In embodiments of any of the aforesaid methods or assays, step (c) comprises forming ex vivo mixtures of the activated T cell or the preparation thereof with target cells, e.g., cancer cells. In embodiments, the cancer cell is a cell chosen from a hematological cancer, a solid cancer, a metastatic cancer (e.g., a CTC, or a combination thereof).

    "ells with enhanced cancer-killing activity.</p>In embodiments, candidate bispecific T cell engager antibodies (BiTE) and/or immunomodulators are evaluated in comparison with a reference, e.g., a bispecific T cell engager antibodies (BiTE) and/or immunomodulator described herein. In embodiments, a candidate bispecific T cell engager antibody (BiTE) that leads to a similar or greater depletion of target (e.g., cancer) cells compared to the reference is identified as an effective bispecific T cell engager antibody (BiTE) and/or immunomodulator. In embodiments, a candidate bispecific T cell engager antibody (BiTE) that leads to a similar or greater formation of or increase in levels of trogocytotic T cells (e.g., that contain markers from cancer cells and markers from effector T cells, e.g., CTLs) is identified as an effective bispecific T cell engager antibody (BiTE) and/or immunomodulator. In embodiments, a candidate bispecific T cell engager antibody (BiTE) and/or immunomodulator that leads to a similar or greater extent of proliferation of the CAR-T cells is identified as effective bispecific T cell engager antibody (BiTE) and/or immunomodulator.</p>In embodiments, the activity of a candidate bispecific T cell engager antibody (BiTE) and/or immunomodulator, and the T cells generated, is determined using an ex vivo/in vitro assay to measure dose response curves, whose mathematical fitting enable quantitative parameters to estimate the activity, selected from at least one from EC50, Effective E:T ratio, basal E:T ratios,</p>Emax or kinetics.\nEC50 of the T cell proliferation determines the concentration of bispecific T cell engager antibody (BiTE) which generates 50% of the activated CAR-T cells in a sample. The EC50 of T cell activation is similar to the EC50 of cancer cell depletion.The Effective E:T ratio represents the activity of the CAR-T cells generated (Effective T cells) on the cancer cells (target cells). High Effective E:T Ratios predict sensitive patients to the CAR-T cells as autologous cell therapy, and low Effective E:T Ratios predict resistant patients to these CAR-T cells as autologous cell therapy.Emax of the dose response curves of the cancer cells determines the percentage (%) of cancer cells alive at high doses of the bispecific T cell engager antibody (BiTE) at a given incubation time. Longer incubations allow CAR-T cells to kill more cancer cells. The activated CAR-T cells need to kill 100% of cancer cells for these T cells to be a suitable monotherapy treatment for a patient. When killing cancer cells is significantly lower than 100%, and this does not improve at longer incubation times, those cancer cells alive are resistant and can be clinically informative to determine a treatment. In order to revert the resistant phenotype, addition of additional immunomodulatory agents, such as immune check point inhibitors, may overcome this immunosuppression and thus overcome this resistance.1. Adding ex vivo additional immunomodulatory agents to relieve immunosuppression is especially meaningful for CAR-T cells generated for subsequent cellular therapy. The reason is that this enables the combination of multiple immunotherapy agents, immunomodulatory agents, including multiple mechanism of action, up to 5, 10, o",

This can be measured by labeling non-pathological cells and showing more selective cancer cell killing when compared to a reference, wherein said reference can be either different patient samples for the same cancer type, or different cell subsets (e.g. clones) within the same patient sample (e.g. trogocytotic).</p>The most common toxicity observed in cellular therapies is called Cytokine Storm, also known as Cytokine-Release Syndrome, cytokine cascade and hypercytokinemia. It is a potentially fatal immune reaction that arises when the cytokines released by CAR-T cells in the process of killing by cell lysis cancer cells are released outside the cells, resulting in highly elevated levels of various cytokines. In embodiments, the CAR-T cell preparation comprises cells having less toxicity ex vivo/in vitro because they generate less cytokines in the supernatant and/or intracellularly. In embodiments, the CAR-T cell preparation comprises cells having both and simultaneously higher cancer-killing activity and less toxicity ex vivo/in vitro, because they generate less cytokines in the supernatant and/or intracellularly per unit of cancer cell killing, that is once the types and/or levels of cytokines released is normalized by the quantitative estimation of cancer cell killing activity such as Effective E:T Ratios, basal E:T ratios, EC50, Emax, kinetics, or a combination of these factors.</p>In embodiments, the efficacy, e.g., potency, activity, of a candidate bispecific T cell engager antibody (BiTE) and/or immunomodulator, is determined using an ex vivo/in vitro assay using different ratios of CAR-T cell:target cell, e.g., where a target cell can be a cancer cell. In some embodiments, the assay involves providing a CAR-T cell or a preparation thereof, e.g., produced according to a method described herein. In embodiments, the assay further involves a step (a) forming a plurality of ex vivo reaction mixtures comprising a candidate bispecific T cell engager antibody (BiTE)(s) and/or immunomodulator(s), a target cell (e.g., cancer cell), and the CAR-T cell or preparation thereof under conditions (e.g., for a period of time and for certain concentrations of the candidate bispecific T cell engager antibody (BiTE) and/or immunomodulatory agent) sufficient to allow the CAR-T cells to kill the target cells. In embodiments, the ex vivo reaction mixtures comprise a plurality of target cell to T cell ratios. The assay can also involve a step (b) for each target cell to T cell ratio, determining the number of target cells after step (a), and optionally determining the number of CAR-T cells after step (a). In embodiments, the assay further comprises a step (c) correlating the target cell to T cell ratio from step (a) with the number of target cells in step (b).

    "ll Activity with BiTE in Presence and Absence of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor PD1 for CLLDespite the clinical improvement with the use of BiTEs in treating hematological malignancies, a remarkable proportion of patients are still resistant. The development of rational combination therapies aims to overcome the resistance to bispecific antibody treatments and the immune checkpoint blockade is one of the more promising approaches to overcome this bispecific antibody resistance. Hence, we can measure in these resistant immunosuppressed populations which immune checkpoint proteins are expressed.</p>This example describes the use of Blinatumumab as the BiTE, tested in combination with Nivolumab (an Anti-PD1 antibody) on B-cells from a CLL sample. The sample was from an adult patient, over 18 years of age, who gave informed consent for study participation.</p>FIG. 24 shows how in a CLL (Chronic Lymphatic Leukemia) PB (peripheral blood) sample that was resistant to blinatumomab (CD3-CD19 BiTE) the addition of an anti-PD1 antibody (Nivolumab) increased the number of CD8+(panel A) and CD4+(panel B) activated T-cells. In panels A and B, the solid lines represent the BiTE alone and the dashed lines are the BiTE plus Nivolumab (BiTE+PD1). It can be seen how the presence of nivolumab increased the number of both CD4+ and CD8+ cell populations over the BiTE alone. Additionally, as seen in panel C, the killing efficacy of those T cells, in the presence of Nivolumab (dotted line) shifted the EC50 towards the left from the BiTE alone (solid line). These results reflected a greater level of T-cell activation and subsequent B-cell depletion with the combination of the BiTE and the immune checkpoint inhibitor, showing an overall improvement of the T-cell response.</p>This demonstrates how a biomarker assay that could guide the selection of which immune checkpoint inhibitors would benefit each patient could be developed. Future work comparing the ex vivo response to the clinical response would confirm the validity of the biomarker assay.</p>Example 11. Combination BiTE with Immune Check Point in AML by Dual Expression and Functional CriteriaIt is common to measure the expression levels of immune check points (ICHKs) on tumor samples to identify patients likely to respond to ICHK treatment. We can combine this criterion with an ex vivo functional criteria, as shown in FIG. 19, to predict which ICHK is best to combine with a BiTE treatment.</p>FIG. 25 shows a dose response curve for a BiTE (black) inducing depletion of leukemic cells (Y axis). In this case is the CD3xCD123 Blinatumumab on a CLL sample. There is a subpopulation of resistant leukemic cells not killed by the BiTE incubation black arrow and test Resistant cells). Because these leukemic cells are resistant to BiTE-activated T cells, they are probably immunosuppressed, most likely by enhanced expression of ICHKs. We tested this hypothesis by adding anti-PD1 (Nivolumab) throughout the BiTE incubation, resultin"
