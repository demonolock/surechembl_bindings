In another embodiment, at least 95% of the treated HSCs exceed the predetermined fluorescence threshold. The composition of human HSCs may be disposed in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or vehicle for storage or for administration to a subject.</p>The predetermined fluorescence threshold in one embodiment is determined by first obtaining a sample of cells containing at least 100 CD34<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>low/\u2212</sup> HSCs from a mononuclear fraction of ordinary umbilical cord blood (cord blood from healthy full term babies). This control (baseline) sample of HSCs is assayed using the P-selectin binding assay (or E-selectin binding assay) described elsewhere herein, or by any other P-selectin fluorescence binding assay (or E-selectin binding assay, respectively) known in the art. P-selectin (or E-selectin) binding fluorescence levels are measured for the CD34<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>low/\u2212</sup> HSCs in the control (baseline) sample.

In one embodiment, the portion of HSCs lacking or having reduced expression of surface protein CD38 has reduced bone marrow homing ability. The HSCs may be derived from human umbilical cord blood, and may be an unfractionated quantity of human umbilical cord blood. Alternatively, the HSCs may be derived from peripheral blood, and may be an unfractionated quantity of peripheral blood. Alternatively, the HSCs may be derived from bone marrow, and may be an unfractionated quantity of bone marrow. The portion of HSCs lacking or having reduced expression of surface protein CD38 comprises PSGL-1 or other structures which have unfucosylated glycans or unfucosylated O-glycans. In the present method, the portion of HSCs lacking or having reduced expression of surface protein CD38 may comprise PSGL-1 having core-2 O-glycans comprising NeuAc\u03b12,3 Gal \u03b21,4 GlcNAc and which are absent a fucose in \u03b11,3 linkage to the GlcNAc or which comprise other glycans which lack proper fucosylation.

    "selectin binding, yet results in minimum toxicity to CD34<sup>+</sup> cells as tested by propidium iodide staining (FIG. 4).</p>Measurement of Fucosylated Epitopes on CD34<sup>+</sup> Cells and Verification by Flow Cytometry that In Vitro \u03b11,3 Fucosylation Creates Fucosylated Epitopes on CD34<sup>30 </sup> Cells.</p>Sialyl Lewis<sup>x </sup>is a fucosylation epitope. By incubating with an anti-sLe<sup>x </sup>mAb HECA 452 (rat IgM, hybridoma from American Type Culture Collection [ATCC]), we examined the sLe<sup>x </sup>epitopes on the CD34<sup>+</sup> cells. The bound mAb was detected with FITC-conjugated goat F(ab)\u20322 fragments to rat IgM (Caltag). As indicated by FIG. 5A, 26% of the CD34<sup>+</sup> cells obtained from cord blood express low or no fucosylated epitopes. These data demonstrate that a subset of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells is not properly fucosylated. To investigate if in vitro \u03b11,3-fucosylation can create fucosylated epitopes on the CD34<sup>+</sup> cells, we stained the cells with HECA 452 after treatment of the CD34<sup>+</sup> cells with FT-VI and GDP-fucose in the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup> using the method described above. We found that the in vitro \u03b11,3-fucosylation dramatically increased sLe<sup>x </sup>epitopes on cord blood-derived CD34<sup>+</sup> cells as indicated by HECA 452 staining (FIG. 5B).</p>P-Selectin Binding\u2014Results</p>Verification of the Binding Profiles of Soluble P-Selectin on Cord Blood-Derived CD34<sup>+</sup> Cells.</p>For the P-selectin binding assay, cord blood-derived CD34<sup>+</sup> cells, after Fc receptor blocking, were incubated with anti-CD34-PE and with P-selectin isolated from human platelets. P-selectin binding was detected with FITC-labeled S12, a non-blocking mAb to human P-selectin. Incubations of the cells were performed at 4 C for 20 min. A saturating amount of P-selectin was used in the experiments after a serial titration (FIG. 6). In control experiments, P-selectin incubations of the cells were carried out in the presence of G1, a blocking mAb to P-selectin, PL1, a blocking mAb to PSGL-1, or 10 mM EDTA, which eliminates Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent selectin-ligand interactions. Flow cytometry analyses showed that about 27% of the CD34<sup>+</sup> cells (primarily comprising the CD38<sup>low/\u2212</sup> cells) did not bind to P-selectin, which is consistent with previously published data (FIG. 7A) (Hidalgo, A., Weiss, L. A., and Frenette, P. S. Functional selectin ligands mediating human CD34<sup>+</sup> cell interaction with bone marrow endothelium are enhanced postnatally. Adhesion pathways mediating hematopoietic progenitor cell homing to bone marrow. J. Clin. Invest. 110:559-569. 2002). FIG. 7C showed that P-selectin bound specifically to PSGL-1 on the CD34<sup>+</sup> cells because the G1 and PL1 antibodies and EDTA abolished binding.</p>Demonstration by Flow Cytometry that In Vitro \u03b11,3 Fucosylation of the Surface of CD34<sup>+</sup> Cells Increases Binding to P-Selectin.</p>The cord blood-d",
    "4<sup>+</sup> cells were divided into two groups for further processing. One group was incubated with GDP-fucose and FT-VI as described above, and another was treated with FT-VI without GDP-fucose (sham-treated control). The P-selectin-binding ability of the two groups of cells was compared using an in vitro flow chamber rolling assay system as described below. P-selectin isolated from human platelets was immobilized in a parallel-plate flow chamber. A P-selectin site density of 145 sites/\u03bcm<sup>2 </sup>was used as measured by binding of <sup>125</sup>I-labeled anti-P-selectin mAb S12. Sham-treated or FTVI-treated CD34<sup>+</sup> cells (10<sup>6</sup>/ml in Hanks' balanced salt solution and 0.5% human albumin) were perfused over P-selectin at a wall shear stress of 1 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup>. The accumulated number of rolling cells was measured with a videomicroscopy system coupled to an image analysis system. The CD34<sup>+</sup> cells rolled in a Ca<sup>++</sup>-dependent manner by human P-selectin-PSGL-1 interactions because EDTA and antibodies G1 and PL1 abolished the rolling, and no rolling was observed on plates coated only with human serum albumin (FIG. 8). Compared to sham-treated CD34<sup>+</sup> cells, about 3-fold more FT-VI-treated CD34<sup>+</sup> cells rolled on P-selectin.</p>E-Selectin Binding\u2014Results</p>Binding Profiles of Soluble E-Selectin to CB-Derived HSCs.</p>Murine soluble E-selectin/human IgM chimera (E-selectin/IgM) was used for the fluid phase E-selectin binding assay. CD45/human IgM chimera was used as negative control. The cells were incubated with the E-selectin/Ig M after Fc receptor blocking. E-selectin binding was then detected with FITC-labeled goat anti-human IgM polyclonal antibodies. The cells were also stained with PE-labeled anti-CD34 mAb (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif.). Incubations were performed at 4\u00b0 C. for 20 min. A saturated amount of E-selectin was used in the experiments after a serial titration. In control experiments, stainings were carried out in the presence of 9A9, a blocking mAb to E-selectin, or 10 mM EDTA, which eliminates Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent selectin-ligand interactions. Flow cytometry analyses showed that about 25% of the CD34<sup>+</sup> HSCs did not bind to E-selectin (FIG. 9A). FIG. 9C showed that the interaction of CD34<sup>+</sup> HSCs with E-selectin was specific because mAb 9A9 and EDTA abolished it.</p>In Vitro \u03b11,3-Fucosylation Increases CD34<sup>+</sup> HSC Binding to E-Selectin as Measured by Flow Cytometry.</p>The CB-derived CD34<sup>+</sup> HSCs were divided into two groups. One group (2-4\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>cells) was incubated with 1 mM GDP-fucose, 20 mU/ml FTVI (Calbiochem), and 10 mM MnCl<sub>2 </sub>in 0.5 ml HBSS/1% HSA for 40 minutes at 37 C, in an incubator containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.
