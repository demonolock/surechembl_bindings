    "ype are the time and location of the pathogenic mutation. Thus, PROS is characterized by a high degree of inter-individual phenotypic heterogeneity. Overgrowth is characterized by a large difference for unknown reasons: some lesions exhibit overgrowth limited to childhood, while others have progressive soft tissue overgrowth during adult life. Complications of PROS depend on the anatomical site and the extent of overgrowth, but may include functional impairment (e.g., functional impairment of walking or swallowing), pain, cardiac functional impairment, pulmonary hypertension, seizures, impaired neurodevelopmental development, recurrent superficial infections, thromboembolism and/or hemorrhage, and other manifestations, all of which may lead to debilitation and early death. Current treatments rely on surgical procedures, amputation, and/or endovascular occlusion procedures, which are primarily aimed at volume reduction. Regrowth after surgery often occurs and often requires repeated surgical procedures. There is a great unmet need for targeted, new treatments and effective therapies to combat PROS. </p>April, which is also known as (S) -pyrrolidine-1, 2-dicarboxylic acid 2-amide 1- ({ 4-methyl-5- [2- (2, 2-trifluoro-1, 1-dimethyl-ethyl) -pyridin-4-yl ] -thiazol-2-yl } -amide) or BYL719, is an oral \u03b1 -specific class I phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI 3K) inhibitor, belonging to the class of 2-aminothiazoles. In biochemical assays, apicalist inhibits the p110\u03b1 subunit of PI3K (ic50=4.6 nM) more than 50-fold compared to other class I PI3K isoforms (e.g., p110\u03b2ic50=1156nm, p110\u03b4 ic50=290 nM, p110\u03b3ic50=250 nM) and is inactive against most other kinases (Fritsch C et al, (2014) Characterization of the novel and specific PI k\u03b1 inhibitor NVP-BYL719 and development of the patient stratification strategy for clinical trials [ characterization of novel specific PI3k\u03b1 inhibitor NVP-BYL719 and development of clinical trial patient stratification strategies ].

It was administered to two patients (one adult and one child) diagnosed with PIK3CA mutation and with severe PROS clinical manifestations. Adult participants were 29 year old men who had previously received Sirolimus (Sirolimus) treatment and progressed. Pediatric patients were nine year old girls diagnosed with PIK3CA c.3140a &gt; G (H1047R) mutations, who did not receive any targeted systemic treatment for their PROS/constituent syndrome. Both patients were well tolerated and had no adverse effects except that adult patients experienced hyperglycemia (but were well controlled with nutritional therapy); aprilsedge does not affect the growth of pediatric patients. In both patients, a decrease in the volume of PROS lesions correlates with an improvement in the function of the affected organ and an improvement in physical performance. Several adult and pediatric patients with PROS have been successfully treated with apicalist under contemplative use. "
