    "ime. For measuring the interaction between ustekinumab and its target the ustekinumab antibody is immobilized on the biosensor tip and contacted with a solution containing the target protein.</p>The binding of the ustekinumab antibody produced by the method of the present invention to IL-12 or IL-23 is essentially the same as that of the reference product, i.e. the binding to IL-12 or IL-23 differs by less than 20%, preferably by less than 15% from the binding of the reference product.</p>Surprisingly, it has been found that the binding of the ustekinumab antibody produced by the method of the present invention to IL-23 and IL-12 is similar to the binding of the reference product to IL-23 and IL-12.</p>The binding of the ustekinumab antibody produced by the method of the present invention to IL-23 differs by not more than 10%, preferably by not more than 9%, more preferably by not more than 8%, even more preferably by not more than 7% and most preferably by not more than 5% from the binding of the reference product to IL-23.</p>The binding of the ustekinumab antibody produced by the method of the present invention to IL-12 differs by not more than 20%, preferably by not more than 15%, more preferably by not more than 12% and most preferably by not more than 10% from the binding of the reference product to IL-12.</p>The binding of the ustekinumab antibody produced by the method of the present invention to FcRn is essentially the same as that of the reference product, i.e. the dissociation constant K<sub>D </sub>for binding to FcRn differs by less than 10%, preferably by less than 8%, more preferably by less than 6% and most preferably by less than 4% from the dissociation constant K<sub>D </sub>of the reference product.</p>The inhibition of IL12-induced gene expression by the ustekinumab antibody can for example be investigated by incubating cells which are responsive to IL-12, such as the human natural killer lymphoma cell line NK-92, with IL-12 and the antibody sample and then detecting the production of a target molecule, such as interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3). The target molecule, e.g. IFN\u03b3, may be detected and/or quantified by any suitable method, such as ELISA.</p>Surprisingly, it has been found that the inhibition of IFN\u03b3 production by the ustekinumab antibody produced by the method of the present invention is as strong as the inhibition of IFN\u03b3 production by the reference product. The inhibition of IFN\u03b3 production by the ustekinumab antibody produced by the method of the present invention differs by not more than 16%, preferably by not more than 14%, more preferably by not more than 12% and most preferably by not more from 10% from the inhibition of IFN\u03b3 production by the reference product.</p>The method of the present invention comprises determining that the recombinant ustekinumab antibody preparation meets one or more of the following criteria (i) to (iv):\n(i) binding to IL-23 differs from that of the reference product by not more than 10%;(ii) binding to IL-12 differs from that of the reference product by not more than 20%;(iii) binding to FcRn differs from that of the reference product by less than 10%; and(iv) inhibition o"
