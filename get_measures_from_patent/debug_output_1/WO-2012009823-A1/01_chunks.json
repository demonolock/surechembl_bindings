    "ne and 1,4-androstadien-3,17-dione, allows to reduce the dose of acepromazine by 50% and achieve considerable calming effects, as observed in rats, which has a direct impact on the reduction of adverse effects presented by acepromazine and that restrict its clinical use.  ADD decreases grooming time and significantly reduces locomotive activity by approximately 90% of activity depression at a dose of 100 mg / kg of ADD (Figure 9, n = 7); This suggests a similar mechanism of action between both molecules. However, the association between these molecules demonstrates a significant potentiation of the effects obtained independently; Even more interesting is the fact that the effects are maintained even when the usual dose of acepromazine is reduced from 2.5 to 1 mg / kg, compared to those obtained individually by both ADD (50 and 100 mg / kg) as for acepromazine (2.5 mg / kg) (Fig 9-1 1).</p>In relation to in vitro tests, the patch-clamp technique is performed in full cell mode. ADD registration by this technique shows potentiating effects of GABA evoked currents (2.5 \u03bc\u039c) in hippocampal neurons of rat embryos, as shown in Figure No. 5A., ADD modulation was rapidly and completely reversible. . ADD induces a potentiation of GABAergic currents of approximately 30%, which translates into a significant reduction in GABA EC <sub>50</sub> from 8.9 to 6.2 \u03bc\u039c. The concentration-response curve for GABA 2.5 \u03bc\u039c (black square) and GABA 2.5 \u03bc\u039c co-applied with 10 \u03bc\u039c ADD (white box) shows that EC50 is significantly reduced, around 31%. (n = 6, <sup>*</sup> p &lt;0.05). (Fig. 5B, n = 6). This allows us to suggest a synergistic mechanism of potentiation of motor depression, between a dopaminergic activation induced by acepromazine and a GABAergic by ADD, in turn allows us to rule out a summation effect on the same pharmacological target. At the same time, the mechanism of action for ADD is suggested according to the results obtained in vitro where 1,4-androstadiene-3,17-dione potentiates GABAergic currents, as do drugs with recognized anesthetic / sedative activity such as barbiturates, alphaxolone , diazepam, etc.  Application examples</p>The study was carried out in 2 stages: first the activity of the molecule was identified and then its effect was characterized and quantified.</p>\u00a0In the first instance, a blind test was carried out, using molecules that were identified with a code, which was assigned arbitrarily, symbolized by the letters ADD that represent the word neurosteroid, and a consecutive number from 1 to 15. Subsequently, it Identify the molecule.</p>Obtaining steroidal derivatives</p>The steroids were obtained by biotransformation processes, they were grown in fungal strains in liquid medium for 120 h, with agitation of 120 rpm. After 96 h of culture, the steroidal substrate of plant origin was added at a concentration that ranged between 500-2000 mg / l. Samples of 20 ml were taken daily, in order to assess the biotransformer capacity of the strains. T"
