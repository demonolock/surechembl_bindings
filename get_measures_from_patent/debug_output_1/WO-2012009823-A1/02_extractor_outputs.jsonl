{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\nADD induces a potentiation of GABAergic currents of approximately 30%, which translates into a significant reduction in GABA EC50 from 8.9 to 6.2 \u03bc\u039c.\nThe concentration-response curve for GABA 2.5 \u03bc\u039c (black square) and GABA 2.5 \u03bc\u039c co-applied with 10 \u03bc\u039c ADD (white box) shows that EC50 is significantly reduced, around 31%. \nADD registration by this technique shows potentiating effects of GABA evoked currents (2.5 \u03bc\u039c) in hippocampal neurons of rat embryos, as shown in Figure No. 5A."}
