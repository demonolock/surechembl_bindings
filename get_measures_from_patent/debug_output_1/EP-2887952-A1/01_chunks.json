    "ated linker and hapten may then be conjugated to a protein in a solvent, such as a pH 7.5 phosphate buffer, at about 20 \u00baC, for about 2.5 hours. Suitable proteins are known to those skilled in the art and include keyhole limpet hemocyanin, bovine thyroglobulin, and ovalbumin. The same methodology may be used to conjugate proteins to carboxylic acid functionalized haptens where R<sup>1</sup> or R<sup>2</sup> is </p>\n ANTIBODIES </p>[00142] The present invention is directed to an isolated antibody or a binding fragment thereof, which binds to olanzapine and which: (i) is generated in response to a conjugate of a compound of Formula I and an immunogenic carrier; or (ii) competes for an epitope which is the same as an epitope bound by the antibody of (i). The term \"antibody\" refers to a specific protein capable of binding an antigen or portion thereof (in accordance with this invention, capable of binding to an anti- psychotic drug or metabolite thereof). An antibody is produced in response to an immunogen which may have been introduced into a host, e.g., an animal or a human, \n\n by injection. The generic term \"antibody\" includes polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, and antibody fragments. </p>[00143] \"Antibody\" or \"antigen-binding antibody fragment\" refers to an intact antibody, or a fragment thereof, that competes with the intact antibody for binding. Generally speaking, an antibody or antigen-binding antibody fragment, is said to specifically bind an antigen when the dissociation constant is less than or equal to 1 \u03bcM, preferably less than or equal to 100 nM and most preferably less than or equal to 10 nM. Binding can be measured by methods know to those skilled in the art, an example being the use of a BIAcore<sup>TM</sup> instrument. </p>[00144] Antibody fragments comprise a portion of an intact antibody, preferably the antigen binding or variable region of the intact antibody. Binding fragments include Fab, Fab', F(ab')<sub>2</sub>, and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies; single- chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. An antibody other than a \"bispecific\" or \"bifunctional\" antibody is understood to have each of its binding sites identical. </p>[00145] As used herein, \"epitope\" includes any protein determinant capable of specific binding to an immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor. Epitopic determinants usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and usually have specific three dimensional structural characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. Two antibodies are said to \"bind the same epitope\" if one antibody is shown to compete with the second antibody in a competitive binding assay, by any of the methods well known to those skilled in the art (such as the BIAcore<sup>TM</sup> method referred to above). In reference to a hapten (such as olanzapine or other anti-psychotic drug), an antibody can be generated against the non-antigenic hapten molecule by conjugating the hapten to an immunogenic carrier. An antibody is then generated which recognizes an \"epitope\" defined by the hapten. </p>[00146] \"Isolated\" when used in the context of an antibody means altered \"by the hand of man\" from any natural state; i.e., that, if it occurs in nature, it has been changed or removed from its original environment, or both. For example, a naturally occurring antibody naturally present in a living animal in its natural state is not \"isolated\", but the same antibody separated from the coexisting materials of its natural state is \"isolated\", as the term is employed herein. Antibodies may occur in a composition, such as an immunoassay reagent, which are not naturally occurring \n\n compositions, and therein remain isolated antibodies within the meaning of that term as it is employed herein. </p>[00147] \"Cross-reactivity\" refers to the reaction of an antibody with an antigen that was not used to induce that antibody. </p>[00148] Preferably, the antibody of the subject invention will bind to the drug and any desired pharmacologically active metabolites. By altering the location of the attachment of the immunogenic carrier to the compounds of the invention, selectivit"
