{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n* Maleimide class compound of the present invention is most preferably shown in 1,6,14,16 or 42.\n* Compared with prior art, the beneficial effects are mainly reflected as follows: (1) maleimide class compound has Higher anti-Li Shiman protozoosis activity, part of compounds are higher than existing drug (IC50 is 1/10th of existing compound)\uff1b\n* The half of amphotericin B.Therefore the present invention prepares resulting structural compounds containing maleimide and is expected to become prevention and treatment benefit A kind of efficient, nontoxic, safe drugs of assorted graceful disease.\n* part of compounds are higher than existing drug (IC50 is 1/10th of existing compound)\uff1b \n\nNote that the text does not provide explicit units for the IC50 values, but it does provide a comparison to existing compounds, which may be sufficient to infer the units. However, without explicit units, these sentences may not fully meet the criteria. \n\nA more careful analysis of the text reveals that there are no sentences that provide a specific molecule name, a bioactivity metric, a specific numeric value for that metric, and a unit for that value. Therefore, the list of extracted sentences is empty."}
