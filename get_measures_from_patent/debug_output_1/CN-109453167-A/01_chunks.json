    "al\nRespectively there is feature on performance and epidemiology.China's kala-azar is caused by Leishmania donovani.Leishmaniasis is treated at present\nDrug has: meter Te Fuxin (miltefosine), stibii natrii gluconas (sodium stibogluconate), Meglumine Antimonate\n(meglumineantimoniate), Pan Ta meter Ding (pentamidine), amphotericin B (amphotericin B) He Balong\nMycin (paromonycin).But these drugs all have the shortcomings that price is high, side effect is big and toxicity is big.But also occur\nDrug resistance.Therefore, find and develop the task of top priority that cheap, safe and effective drug has become treatment leishmaniasis.</p>Maleimide is also known as maleimide (Maleimide), is the five-membered heterocycles containing N.\n\u03b1, \u03b2 unsaturation imidodicarbonic diamide cyclic structure of maleimide class compound can be in conjunction with mercapto functional groups, thus shadow\nNumerous enzymes containing sulfydryl in vivo are rung, and then influence the growth of organism.Research has shown that such compound is to many bacteriums, ferment\nThe microorganisms such as mother, fungi have many advantages, such as good inhibiting effect, and have efficient, low toxicity.But using such compound come\nPrevention and treatment leishmaniasis was attempted not yet.The present invention prepares the compound for having synthesized a series of structure containing maleic anhydride,\nAnd have detected its anti-Leishmania activity, most compounds have preferable anti-Leishmania activity, IC50 be\nThe half of amphotericin B.Therefore the present invention prepares resulting structural compounds containing maleimide and is expected to become prevention and treatment benefit\nA kind of efficient, nontoxic, safe drugs of assorted graceful disease.</p>(3) summary of the invention</p>It is an object of the present invention to provide a kind of maleimide class compounds in preparation Leishmania insecticide\nUsing such compound has preferable anti-Leishmania activity, can be developed further into the treatment for leishmaniasis\nDrug.</p>The technical solution adopted by the present invention is that:</p>The present invention provides a kind of maleimide class compounds to prepare answering in anti-leishmaniasis preparation\nWith the compound is one of following:</p></p>R in formula (I-a)<sub>1</sub>For hydrogen, methyl or chlorine\uff1bR<sub>2</sub>For hydrogen or chlorine\uff1bN is the positive integer of 4-12\uff1b</p>R in formula (I-b)<sub>3</sub>For hydrogen, methyl or chlorine\uff1bR<sub>4</sub>For

hydrogen, methyl or chlorine\uff1bR<sub>8</sub>For hydrogen or chlorine\uff1b</p>R in formula (I-e)<sub>9</sub>For hydrogen, methyl or chlorine\uff1bR<sub>10</sub>For hydrogen or chlorine.</p>Further, preferably maleimide class compound is one of following:</p></p></p>Maleimide class compound of the present invention is most preferably shown in 1,6,14,16 or 42.</p>Maleimide class compound of the present invention by bibliography (Chen X L, Zhang L J, Li F G,\net al.Synthesis and antifungal evaluation of a series of maleimides[J].Pest\nManagement Science, 2015,71 (3): 433-440.) and patent of invention CN201310047337.3 and\nZL201310047509.7 preparation.</p>Compared with prior art, the beneficial effects are mainly reflected as follows: (1) maleimide class compound has\nHigher anti-Li Shiman protozoosis activity, part of compounds are higher than existing drug (IC50 is 1/10th of existing compound)\uff1b\n(2) such compound not leishmanial resistance of single pair, and toxicity is lower, has a good application prospect.</p>(4) specific embodiment</p>The present invention is described further combined with specific embodiments below, but protection scope of the present invention is not limited in\nThis:</p>Embodiment 1: the preparation of compound 1-45</p>Bibliography (Chen X L, Zhang L J, Li F G, et al.Synthesis is pressed in the preparation of compound 1-45\nand antifungal
