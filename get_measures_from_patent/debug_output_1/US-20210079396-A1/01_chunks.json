Compositions for oral administration include powders or granules, suspensions or solutions in water or non-aqueous media, capsules, sachets or tablets. Thickeners, flavoring agents, diluents, emulsifiers, dispersing aids or binders may be desirable. Compositions for parenteral administration may include sterile aqueous solutions which may also contain buffers, diluents and other suitable additives. In some cases it may be more effective to treat a patient with an oligonucleotide in conjunction with other traditional therapeutic modalities in order to increase the efficacy of a treatment regimen. As used herein, the term \u201ctreatment regimen\u201d is meant to encompass therapeutic, palliative and prophylactic modalities.</p>The formulation of therapeutic compositions and their subsequent administration is believed to be within the skill of those in the art. Dosing is dependent on severity and responsiveness of the disease state to be treated, with the course of treatment lasting from several days to several months, or until a cure is effected or a diminution of the disease state is achieved. Optimal dosing schedules can be calculated from measurements of drug accumulation in the body of the patient. Persons of ordinary skill can easily determine optimum dosages, dosing methodologies and repetition rates. Optimum dosages may vary depending on the relative potency of individual oligonucleotides, and can generally be estimated based on EC50 s found to be effective in vitro and in in vivo animal models. In general, dosage is from 0.01 mg/kg to 100 mg per kg of body weight, and may be given once or more daily, weekly, monthly or yearly, or even once every 2 to 20 years. Persons of ordinary skill in the art can easily estimate repetition rates for dosing based on measured residence times and concentrations of the drug in bodily fluids or tissues. Following successful treatment, it may be desirable to have the patient undergo maintenance therapy to prevent the recurrence of the disease state, wherein the oligonucleotide is administered in maintenance doses, ranging from 0.01 mg/kg to 100 mg per kg of body weight, once or more daily, to once every 20 years. In the treatment or prevention of conditions which require connexin modulation an appropriate dosage level will generally be about 0.001 to 100 mg per kg patient body weight per day which can be administered in single or multiple doses. Preferably, the dosage level will be about 1 to about 40 mg/kg per day.</p>The oligonucleotides of this invention can be used in diagnostics, therapeutics, prophylaxis, and as research reagents and in kits. Since the oligonucleotides of this invention hybridize to nucleic acids encoding connexin, sandwich, calorimetric and other assays can easily be constructed to exploit this fact. Provision of means for detecting hybridization of oligonucleotide with the connexin genes or mRNA can routinely be accomplished. Such provision ma",
    " and Nuclear StainingSlides were placed in glass racks to facilitate immersion in a series of different staining reagents. Racks were agitated when placing them into reagents to break surface tension and to drain them between each solution change. Prior to Gill's II Haematoxylin/Eosin staining, slides that were stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. were first warmed up to room temperature for 1-2 min, then either fixed in cold acetone first and/or immediately hydrated with a quick dip in tap water. Slides were stained in Gill's II Haematoxylin for 2 min, after which excess stain was rinsed off in tap water. Stain differentiation was achieved by dipping in Scott's tap water substitute (STWS) for 4 sec. A rinse in running tap water for 1 min was then performed before staining in 1% eosin for 30 consecutive dips. Finally, sections were quickly rinsed in tap water, dehydrated through 95%, 100% EtOH, cleared in xylene, and mounted with DPX mounting medium (Sigma). For nuclear counter staining (in parallel with H/E or immunohistochemical analysis) Hoechst 33 258 (Sigma) was used. Measurement of cornea thickness was carried out on H/E stained sections.</p>ImmunohistochemistrySections were immunolabeled for connexin43 using a site-specific monoclonal antibody, for myofibroblasts using an antibody recognizing alpha smooth muscle actin, for basal lamina deposition with an anti-laminin-1 antibody. In addition anti-vimentin antibodies were used to differentiate stromal keratocytes from myofibroblasts and a Ki-67 antibody was used to show cell proliferation.</p>Ex Vivo Histological AnalysisResults showed that lesions made by excimer photoablation had closed by 24 hr post-surgery (FIG. 2). The typical invasion of the stroma by mononucleated/multinucleated and/or round, ovoid cells at the periphery and at the center of the cornea was observed in both groups, most pronounced at 24 hr post-surgery, but with the antisense ODN treated group showing a significantly smaller number of these cells than the control group (FIG. 2A,B,C). This parallels the findings from the in vivo confocal photomicrographs shown in Example 1. The epithelium thickness was variable in control corneas as seen in FIG. 2 at the site of laser induced lesion (Figure A, B), and in the stoma beneath the ablated area (Figure A,B) and in the peripheral stroma (Figure C) there was an extensive invasion by round cells (hypercellularity) in control corneas. Also observed was a pronounced stromal edema in Figure B and Figure C. In the antisense ODN treated corneas the epithelium was of even thickness (Figure D,E) and in the central region (Figure D) and in the peripheral stroma (Figure E) there was little sign of stromal edema. Moreover, in the stroma there were few round cells present. Scales bars in FIG. 2 represent 20 microns.</p>Changes in stromal thickness following treatment with connexin43 ODNs after laser treatment are shown in Table 3, which compares changes in stromal thickness between control and ODN treated co",
    "pared to control corneas. FIG. 3 shows combined micrograph images. Top row shows control corneas, the bottom row shows antisense ODN treated corneas. The typical invasion of the stroma by round cells was seen in both groups within 24 hours at the limbal, peripheral and central areas. However, a smaller density of round cells was exhibited in ODN treated corneas. At the limbus in both groups anti-connexin43 was evenly distributed throughout the stroma (3A,D) but the treated groups had less label in the periphery (3E) compared to controls (3B). By this stage connexin43 levels had returned to normal in the epithelium of both groups but control groups showed a scar like stroma (3C) or hyperplasia (see FIG. 4 below) whereas in antisense treated corneas a normal epithelium with normal levels of connexin43 was seen (3F). Scale bars A, D, E, F represent 10 microns; B and C represent 20 microns. In these figures connexin43 appears as white punctate labeling with cell nuclei appearing grey. The results shown in FIG. 3 suggest that connexin43 protein levels are reduced following treatment with anti-connexin43 ODNs and results in a smaller degree of cell recruitment in the stroma. In addition, only 7% of ODN treated corneas (0% at 24 hr post-surgery, 0% at 48 hr post-surgery, 20% at 72 hr post-surgery) show signs of epithelial hyperplasia compared to 31% control corneas (25% at 24 hr post-surgery, 67% at 48 hr post-surgery, 0% at 72 hr post-surgery). This was assessed on H/E stained and Ki-67 labeled sections.</p>Myofibroblast LabelingLabeling with vimentin antibodies indicated that the increased cell numbers in the stroma of control corneas compared with AS ODN treated corneas were not of undifferentiated keratocyte origin and labeling was therefore carried out with alpha-smooth muscle actin antibodies. This labeling showed that control corneas had a higher number of myofibroblasts beneath the site of surgery, but also in the surrounding peripheral stroma. This increase in myofibroblast numbers and area affected was evident at 24 hours and persisted over 48 and 72 hours through to at least one week after surgery (Table 4). FIG. 4 shows myofibroblast labeling (anti-alpha smooth muscle actin) at 1 week post-laser surgery. FIGS. 4 A, B, and C are controls; and FIGS. 4 D, E, and F are antisense treated corneas. By one week post-wounding, in the control corneas, low to moderate numbers of myofibroblasts are present in the anterior half of the peripheral stroma (4A), moderate to dense levels are present in the mid-peripheral stromal regions (4 B), and moderate levels are seen in the anterior half of the stroma in central regions (4C). In contrast, in the treated corneas, very low numbers of myofibroblasts are present in peripheral (4D) or mid peripheral (4E) stroma and moderate to low numbers in central stroma (4F). In some cases in the central stroma, myofibroblasts are concentrated in the area just under the epithelium (not shown). Thus, the increased cell numb"
