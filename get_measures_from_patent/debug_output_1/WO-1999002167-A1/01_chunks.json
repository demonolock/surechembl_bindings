Conventional pharmaceutical carriers, aqueous, powder or oily bases, thickeners and the like may be necessary or desirable. Coated condoms, gloves and the like may also be useful.</p>\n  Compositions for oral administration include powders or granules, suspensions or solutions in water or non-aqueous media, capsules, sachets or tablets. Thickeners, flavoring agents, diluents, emulsifiers, dispersing aids or binders may be desirable.</p>\n  Compositions for parenteral, intrathecal or intraventricular administration may include sterile aqueous \n\nsolutions which may also contain buffers, diluents and other suitable additives.</p>\n  In addition to such pharmaceutical carriers, cationic lipids may be included in the formulation to facilitate oligonucleotide uptake. One such composition shown to facilitate uptake is Lipofectin (BRL, Bethesda MD) .</p>\n  Dosing is dependent on severity and responsiveness of the condition to be treated, with course of treatment lasting from several days to several months or until a cure is effected or a diminution of disease state is achieved. Optimal dosing schedules can be calculated from measurements of drug accumulation in the body. Persons of ordinary skill can easily determine optimum dosages, dosing methodologies and repetition rates. Optimum dosages may vary depending on the relative potency of individual oligonucleotides, and can generally be calculated based on IC50's or EC50's in in vitro and in vivo animal studies. For example, given the molecular weight of compound (derived from oligonucleotide sequence and chemical structure) and an effective dose such as an IC50, for example (derived experimentally) , a dose in mg/kg is routinely calculated.</p>\n  The present invention is also suitable for diagnosing abnormal proliferative states in tissue or other samples from patients suspected of having a hyperproliferative disease such as cancer, psoriasis or blood vessel restenosis or atherosclerosis. The ability of the oligonucleotides of the present invention to inhibit cell proliferation may be employed to diagnose such states. A number of assays may be formulated employing the present invention, which assays will commonly comprise contacting a tissue sample with an oligonucleotide of the invention under conditions selected to permit detection and, usually, quantitation of such inhibition. Similarly, the present invention can be used to distinguish raf-associated, or, particularly, B-raf-associated \n\ntumors from tumors having other etiologies, in order that an efficacious treatment regime can be designed.</p>\n  The oligonucleotides of this invention may also be used for research purposes. Thus, the specific hybridization exhibited by the oligonucleotides may be used for assays, purifications, cellular product preparations and in other methodologies which may be appreciated by persons of ordinary skill in the art.</p>\n  The oligonucleotides of the invention are also useful for detection and diagnosis of raf expression. For example, radiolabeled oligonucleotides can be prepared by <sup>3i</sup>P labeling at the 5' end with polynucleotide k",
    "ose- response curve for inhibition of the upper B-raf transcript. ISIS 13741 and 14144 had almost identical activity in this assay, with IC50s between 250 and 300 nM. The mismatch controls had no activity (ISIS 14531) or slight activity, with a maximum inhibition of less than 20% at the 400 nM dose (ISIS 14530, ISIS 14529) . Figure 2B shows a dose-response curve for inhibition of the lower B-raf transcript in A549 cells. Against the lower transcript, ISIS 13741 and ISIS 14144 had IC50s of approximately 350 and 275 nM, respectively in this assay, with the mismatch controls never achieving 50% \n\ninhibition at concentrations up to 400 nM. Therefore, ISIS 13741 and 14144 are preferred.</p>\n  Figure 3 shows dose-response curves for reduction of B- raf mRNA levels in T24 cells by these oligonucleotides (all are phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides) after a 4-hour treatment in the presence of lipofectin. Results are normalized to G3PDH and expressed as a percent of control. Figure 3A shows a dose-response curve for inhibition of the upper B-raf transcript. ISIS 13741 and 14144 were again most active, with IC50s of approximately 100 nM and 275 nM, respectively, in this assay. The mismatch controls 14529 and 14531 had no activity, and the mismatch control 14530 achieved a maximum reduction of raf mRNA of approximately 20% at a 400 nM dose. Figure 3B shows a dose-response curve for inhibition of the lower B-raf transcript in T24 cells. Against the lower transcript, ISIS 13741 had an IC50 of approximately 100-125 nM and ISIS 14144 had an IC50 of approximately 250 nM in this assay, with the mismatch controls completely inactive. Therefore ISIS 13741 and 14144 are preferred.</p>\n  2 ' -Methoxyethoxy (2'-MOE) oligonucleotides targeted to B-raf:</p>\n  The oligonucleotides shown in Table 2 were synthesized.

Dose response curves for ISIS 13741, 15341, 15342 and 15344 are shown in Figure 4A. Figure 4A shows the effect of these oligonucleotides on the lower B- raf transcript and Figure 4B shows the effect on the upper transcript. Against the lower transcript, ISIS 13741 (P=S deoxy) and ISIS 15344 (P=S deoxy/MOE) had IC50s of approximately 250 n . The other two compounds tested, ISIS 15341 and 15342, did not achieve 50% inhibition at doses up to 400 nM. Against the upper transcript, ISIS 13741 and 15344 demonstrated IC50s of approximately 150 nM, ISIS 15341 demonstrated an IC50 of approximately 200 nM and ISIS 15342 did not achieve 50% reduction at doses up to 400 nM. Based on these results, ISIS 15341, 13741 and 15344 are preferred.

For phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, the standard oxidation bottle was replaced by a 0.2 M solution of <sup>3</sup>H-1,2- benzodithiole-3-one 1,1-dioxide in acetonitrile for the stepwise thiation of the phosphite linkages. The thiation \n\ncycle wait step was increased to 68 seconds and was followed by the capping step.</p>\n  2 ' -methoxy oligonucleotides were synthesized using 2'- methoxy \u03b2-cyanoethyldiisopropyl-phosphoramidites (Chemgenes, Needham MA) and the standard cycle for unmodified oligonucleotides, except the wait step after pulse delivery of tetrazole and base was increased to 360 seconds.
