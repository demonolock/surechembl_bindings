The preferred exemplified compounds exhibit a Ki value less than 1 micromolar, more preferably less than 500 nanomolar at the Serotonin transporter as determined using the scintillation proximity assay (SPA) described below (WO 2005/060949). Furthermore, the preferred exemplified compounds selectively inhibit the Serotonin transporter relative to the Norepinephrine and dopamine transporters by a factor of at least five using such SPAs.</p>Example 21 - Generation of stable cell lines expressing the human dopamine, Norepinephrine and Serotonin transporters</p>[0208] Standard molecular cloning techniques are used to generate stable cell- lines expressing the human dopamine, Norepinephrine and Serotonin transporters. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used in order to isolate and amplify each of the three full-length cDNAs from an appropriate cDNA library. PCR Primers for the following neurotransmitter transporters are designed using published sequence data. The PCR products are cloned into a mammalian expression vector, such as for example pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), using standard ligation techniques, followed by co-transfection of HEK293 cells using a commercially available lipofection reagent (Lipofectamine\u2122 - Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. \n\n \u2022 [0209] Human dopamine transporter: GenBank M95167, as described in Vandenbergh et al Molecular Brain Research 1992, 15, 161-166, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>\u2022 [0210] Human Norepinephrine transporter: GenBank M65105 as described in Pacholczyk et al, Nature 1991, 350, 350-354, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>\u2022 [0211] Human Serotonin transporter: GenBank L05568 as described in Ramamoorthy et al, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA 1993, 90, 2542-2546, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>Example 22 - In vitro SPA binding assay for the Norepinephrine transporter</p>[0212] The procedure is carried out as described by Gobel et al, Journal of Pharmacological and Toxicological Methods 1999, 42(4), 237-244, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
