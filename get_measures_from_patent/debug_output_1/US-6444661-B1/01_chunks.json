    " of cleavage at the A-A site itself. The A-A mismatch is the only pair cleaved by the \u039b enantiomer, with weaker cleavage than the \u0394 enantiomer.</p>Other DNA photocleavage experiments on similar systems showed DNA cleavage by \u0394[Rh(bpy)<sub>2</sub>(chrysi)]<sup>3+ </sup>is affected by the bases to the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 side of the mismatch site (T/A in SEQ ID NO:1 and C/G in SEQ ID NO:4). When these bases were systematically changed, photocleavage was observed at 83 of 104 of the mismatch-sequence context combinations (80%).</p>Example 4(Photocleavage Titration)</p>A hairpin DNA oligonucleotide was synthesized with the sequence:</p>5\u2032-CATCATGTCCTGCCCTTTTTGGGCACGACATGATG-3\u2032\u2003\u2003(SEQ ID NO:3),</p>having a single C-C mismatch. The hairpin was photocleaved as described in Example 2 above with a [Rh(bpy)<sub>2</sub>(chrysi)]<sup>3+ </sup>at either 313 nm or 365 nm for 7.5 to 15 min. Hairpin DNA concentration was varied from 3\u00d710<sup>\u221210 </sup>M to 1\u00d710<sup>\u22124 </sup>M, with the Rh complex used at 0.10\u00d7 the DNA concentration. The cleavage products were eluted through 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, and analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics Phosphorimager and ImageQuant software. The results are shown in FIG. 2. Cleavage was observed 3\u2032 to the C-C mismatch on both sides of the hairpin: only the cleavage band closest to the end label was quantitated. Data from multiple trials was normalized (open circles) and fit to a standard single binding site binding model (solid line).</p>The thermodynamic binding constant was determined to be 8.4 (\u00b11.0)\u00d710<sup>5 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>. Similar DNA photocleavage titrations at other mismatch sites have measured the affinity of \u0394 [Rh(bpy)<sub>2</sub>(chrysi)]<sup>3+ </sup>between 1\u00d710<sup>7 </sup>and 3\u00d710<sup>5 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>. To examine the level of selectivity, the average binding constant of \u0394 [Rh(bpy)<sub>2</sub>(chrysi)]<sup>3+ </sup>to B-form DNA was also determined. Photocleavage on a 33mer correctly matched hairpin and competitive titration with unlabeled 25mer B-DNA yielded a value of 4 (\u00b12)\u00d710<sup>4 </sup>M<sup>\u22121 </sup>for the average non-specific binding affinity.</p>Although the invention has been described with reference to the presently preferred embodiment, it should be understood that various modifications can be made without departing from the spirit of the invention.
