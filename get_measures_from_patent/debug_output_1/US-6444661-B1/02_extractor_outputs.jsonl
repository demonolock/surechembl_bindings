{"raw_mentions": "The thermodynamic binding constant was determined to be 8.4 (\u00b11.0)\u00d710^5 M^\u22121.\nSimilar DNA photocleavage titrations at other mismatch sites have measured the affinity of \u0394 [Rh(bpy)2(chrysi)]^3+ between 1\u00d710^7 and 3\u00d710^5 M^\u22121.\nTo examine the level of selectivity, the average binding constant of \u0394 [Rh(bpy)2(chrysi)]^3+ to B-form DNA was also determined. \nPhotocleavage on a 33mer correctly matched hairpin and competitive titration with unlabeled 25mer B-DNA yielded a value of 4 (\u00b12)\u00d710^4 M^\u22121 for the average non-specific binding affinity."}
