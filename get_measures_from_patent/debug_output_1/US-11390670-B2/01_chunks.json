All software were accessed through SBGrid.</p>Example 19\u2014Mutations at Cysteine 100 of h5D8 Preserve BindingAnalysis of h5D8 revealed a free cysteine residue at position 100 (C100) in the variable region of the heavy chain. H5D8 variants were generated by substituting C100 with each naturally occurring amino acid in order to characterize binding to and affinity for human and mouse LIF. Binding was characterized using ELISA and Octet assay. Results are summarized in Table 9. ELISA EC50 curves are shown in FIG. 15 (FIG. 15A human LIF and FIG. 15B Mouse LIF).</p>TABLE 9Summary of affinities determined by Octet assay and EC50 determined by ELISAAffinityk<sub>d </sub>(M)Binding EC50 (nM)Mutationhuman LIFmouse LIFhuman LIFmouse LIFC100\u2003&lt;1.0E\u221212 \u00b1 2.252E\u221211\u2009\u20099.946E\u221211 \u00b1 8.272E\u2212120.098780.1605C100S\u2009\u20098.311E\u221210 \u00b1 5.886E\u221211\u2009\u20092.793E\u221209 \u00b1 5.925E\u221211n.d.n.d.C100Q\u2002\u2009\u20093.87E\u221209 \u00b1 1.55E\u221210\u2009\u2009\u20022.84E\u221209 \u00b1 4.85E\u22121110.1826.33C100N\u2002\u2009\u20095.59E\u221209 \u00b1 1.01E\u221210\u2009\u2009\u20026.68E\u221209 \u00b1 9.8E\u22121113.1845.87C100E\u2002\u2009\u20092.67E\u221209 \u00b1 4.64E\u221211\u2009\u2009\u20034.1E\u221209 \u00b1 7.56E\u2212117.17925.3C100D\u2002\u2009\u20092.02E\u221209 \u00b1 8.08E\u221211\u2009\u2009\u20026.49E\u221209 \u00b1 7.16E\u22121111.8922.88C100T\u2002\u2009\u20094.36E\u221210 \u00b1 2.1E\u221211\u2009\u2009\u20021.02E\u221209 \u00b1 1.77E\u2212115.5758.753C100G\u2002\u2009\u20092.49E\u221209 \u00b1 4.2E\u221211\u2009\u2009\u20023.33E\u221209 \u00b1 5.42E\u22121121.9440.17C100P\u2002\u2009\u20092.74E\u221210 \u00b1 2.97E\u221210\u2003&lt;1.0E\u221212 \u00b1 7.64E\u22121034.44101.9C100A\u2003&lt;1.0E\u221212 \u00b1 2.713E\u221211\u2003&lt;1.0E\u221212 \u00b1 1.512E\u2212110.67050.9532C100V\u2003&lt;1.0E\u221212 \u00b1 1.805E\u221211\u2003&lt;1.0E\u221212 \u00b1 8.086E\u2212120.27850.3647C100L\u2003&lt;1.0E\u221212 \u00b1 1.963E\u221211\u2009\u20091.998E\u221210 \u00b1 1.055E\u2212110.4540.547C100I\u2003&lt;1.0E\u221212 \u00b1 1.424E\u221211\u2009\u20093.361E\u221211 \u00b1 7.545E\u2212120.2990.3916C100M\u2009\u20091.155E\u221209 \u00b1 3.400E\u221211\u2009\u20092.676E\u221209 \u00b1 2.449E\u2212110.78521.563C100F\u2009\u20094.376E\u221209 \u00b1 1.127E\u221210\u2009\u20091.147E\u221208 \u00b1 9.099E\u2212118.93221.53C100Y\u2009\u20091.444E\u221208 \u00b1 1.159E\u221209\u2009\u20092.514E\u221208 \u00b1 2.047E\u221209n.d.n.d.C100W\u2009\u20092.508E\u221208 \u00b1 7.036E\u221209\u2009\u20094.819E\u221208 \u00b1 4.388E\u221209n.d.n.d.C100H\u2009\u20091.304E\u221210 \u00b1 1.416E\u221210\u2009\u20094.284E\u221209 \u00b1 1.231E\u2212108.254n.d.C100K\u2009\u20097.477E\u221208 \u00b1 1.581E\u221209\u2009\u20096.053E\u221208 \u00b1 2.589E\u221209n.d.n.d.C100R\u2009\u20091.455E\u221207 \u00b1 6.964E\u221209\u2009\u20095.142E\u221208 \u00b1 3.247E\u221209n.d.n.d.\nMethods\n</p>ELISA: Binding of h5D8 C100 variants to human and mouse LIF was determined by ELISA. Recombinant human or mouse LIF protein was coated on Maxisorp 384-well plates at 1 ug/mL overnight at 4\u00b0 C. Plates were blocked with 1\u00d7 blocking buffer for 2 hours at room temperature. Titrations of each h5D8 C100 variants were added and allowed to bind for 1 hour at room temperature. Plates were washed three times with PBS+0.05% Tween-20. HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG was added and allowed to bind for 30 min at room temperature. Plates were washed three times with PBS+0.05% Tween-20 and developed using 1\u00d7TMB substrate. The reaction was stopped with 1M HCl and absorbance at 450 nm was measured. Generation of figures and non-linear regression analysis was performed using Graphpad Prism.</p>Octet RED96: The affinity of h5D8 C100 variants to human and mouse LIF was determined by BLI using the Octet RED96 system. h5D8 C100 variants were loaded onto Anti-Human Fc biosensors at 7.5 ug/mL following a 30 second baseline in 1\u00d7 kinetics buffer. Titrations of human or mouse LIF protein were associated to the loaded biosensors for 90 seconds and allowed to dissociate in 1\u00d7 kinetics buffer for 300 seconds. KDs were calculated by the data analysis software using a 1:1 global fit model.</p>Example 20\u2014h5D8 Blocks Binding of LIF to Gp130 In VitroTo determine whether h5D8 prevented LIF from binding to LIFR, a molecular binding assay using the Octet RED 96 platform was performed. H5D8 was loaded onto AHC biosensors by anti-human Fc capture. Then, the biosensors were dipped in LIF and, as expected, association was observed (FIG. 16A, middle third). Subsequently, the biosensors were dipped in different concentrations of LIFR. A dose-dependent association was observed (FIG. 16A, right third). The control experiment demonstrated that this association was LIF-specific (not shown), and not due to a non-specific interaction of LIFR with h5D8 or with the biosensors.</p>To further characterize the binding of h5D8 and LIF, a series of ELISA binding experiments was conducted. H5D8 and LIF were pre-incubated and were then introduced to plates coated with either recombinant human LIFR (hLIFR) or gp130. The lack of binding between the h5D8/LIF complex and the coated substrate would indicate that h5D8 in some way disrupted the binding of LIF to the receptor. Additionally, control antibodies that either did not bind LIF (isotype control, indicated by (\u2212)) or that bind LIF at known binding sites (B09 does not compete with either gp130 or LIFR for LIF binding; r5D8 is the rat parental version of h5D8) were also used. The ELISA results demonstrated that the h5D8/LIF complex was able to bind hLIFR (as was r5D8/LIF complex), indicating that these antibodies did not prevent the LIF/LIFR association (FIG. 16A). In contrast, the h5D8/LIF complex (and a r5D8/LIF complex) was not able to bind recombinant human gp130 "
