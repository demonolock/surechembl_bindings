    "ntion are also provided, including eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells.</p>The present invention also provides antibodies in either polyclonal or monoclonal form which bind specifically to the polypeptides of the present invention. DEFINITIONS</p>Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by those of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, the preferred methods and materials are described. For purposes of the present invention, the following terms are defined below.</p>The term \"antibody\" refers to a polypeptide substantially encoded by an immunoglobulin gene or immunoglobulin genes, or fragments thereof which specifically bind and recognize an analyte (antigen). The recognized immunoglobulin genes include the kappa, lambda, alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon and mu constant region genes, as well as the myriad immunoglobulin variable region genes. Light chains are classified as either kappa or lambda. Heavy chains are classified as gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon, which in turn define the immunoglobulin classes, IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE, respectively.</p>An exemplary immunoglobulin (antibody) structural unit comprises a tetramer. Each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide \n\nchains, each pair having one \"light\" (about 25 kD) and one \"heavy\" chain (about 50-70 kD). The N-terminus of each chain defines a variable region of about 100 to 1 10 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The terms variable light chain (V<sub>L</sub>) and variable heavy chain (V<sub>H</sub>) refer to these light and heavy chains respectively.</p>Antibodies exist e.g., as intact immunoglobulins or as a number of well characterized fragments produced by digestion with various peptidases. Thus, for example, pepsin digests an antibody below the disulfide linkages in the hinge region to produce F(ab)'<sub>2</sub> a dimer of Fab which itself is a light chain joined to V<sub>H</sub>-C<sub>H</sub>1 by a disulfide bond. The F(ab)'<sub>2</sub> may be reduced under mild conditions to break the disulfide linkage in the hinge region, thereby converting the F(ab)'<sub>2</sub> dimer into an Fab' monomer. The Fab' monomer is essentially an Fab with part of the hinge region (see, Fundamental Immunology, Third Edition, W.E. Paul, ed.. Raven Press, N.Y. (1993), which is incorporated herein by reference, for a more detailed description of other antibody fragments). While various antibody fragments are defined in terms of the digestion of an intact antibody, one of skill will appreciate that such Fab' fragments may be synthesized de novo either chemically or by utilizing recombinant DNA methodology. Thus, the term antibody, as used herein, also includes antibody fragments either produced by the modification of whole antibodies or those synthesized de n",
    "and 19 kDa proteins, indicating the specificity of the antibodies.</p>Using anti-CDK6 antibodies, a higher level of co-precipitated 19 kDa and an additional 16 kDa proteins was observed, which again was competed away with CDK6 peptide. The 19 kDa protein again co-migrated with the in vitro translated p19 protein, whereas the 16 kDa protein co-migrated with in vitro translated p16 protein, suggesting that they correspond to the p19 and p16 cell cycle inhibitors, respectively. No p27, p21 or pi 5 inhibitors were evident. Using p19 specific antibody, a 19 kDa protein as well as 34 and 40 kDa proteins were observed. The bands from the 34 and 40 kDa proteins were diminished or eliminated when a competing GST-p19 protein was included in the reaction. Thus, both CDK4 and CDK6 proteins were present in molar excess relative to the level of the associating p19. In order to ascertain the identity of the 19 kDa protein co-precipitated with the CDK6 antibodies, we performed a double immunoprecipitation experiment. We chose CDK6 because it is known to be a major G1 kinase in T cells (Meyerson and Harlow (1994) Mol. Cell. Biol. 14: 2077-2086). Second immunoprecipitation of the CDK6 immunocomplex with anti-p19 antibodies yielded the p19 protein. As a control, similarly purified rabbit antisera specific for the Sp3 transcription factor or the pre-immune sera were used. As expected, they did not precipitate the 19 kDa protein. In a reciprocal experiment, anti-CDK6 antibodies precipitated a 40 kD CDK6 protein from the anti-p19 immunocomplex. Thus, p19 associates with CDK6 protein in vivo. Similar experiments also showed that p19 associates with CDK4 in vivo. \n\n Example 5: o19 inhibits cvclinD-CDK4 but not cvclinE-CDK2 kinase activity</p>The in vitro effect of p19 on the cyclin dependent kinase activity was tested in a kinase inhibition assay. 106 insect Sf9 cells were infected with either cyclin D1 or CDK4 recombinant baculoviruses alone, or coinfected with both viruses at a multiplicity of infection of 5. Cyclin E and CDK2 recombinant baculoviruses were also used to coinfect Sf9 cells. After 72 hours, cells were resuspended in 500 ml kinase buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCI, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM sodium fluoride, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 mM yff-glycerophosphate) plus 1 mg/ml antipain, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin, and 0.1 mM Phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and lysed by passing the cells through a 26G1 /2 needle 6 times. The cleared lysates were aliquoted and saved at -80\u00b0C. For the kinase assays, 2 ml of insect cell lysates were mixed with various amount of bacterially expressed glutathione-S-transferase (GST), or GST-p19, or GST-p16 in 50 ml of kinase buffer and pre-incubated at 30 \u00b0C for 30 to 40 minutes (Xiong et al. (1993) Nature 366: 701-704). This mixture was then added to the bacterially expressed GST-Rb large pocket protein (0.5 mg) immobilized on glutathione agarose beads plus 50 mCi of [32P-g] ATP in 50 ml of kinase buff"
