A group of compounds has now been discovered which may enhance cholinergic function via an action at muscarinic and nicotinic receptors within the central nervous system. </p>[0018] The term \u201cpharmacophore\u201d is known in the art, and, as used herein, refers to a molecular moiety capable of exerting a selected biochemical effect, e.g., inhibition of an enzyme, binding to a receptor, chelation of an ion, and the like. A selected pharmacophore can have more than one biochemical effect, e.g., can be an inhibitor of one receptor (or enzyme) and an antagonist, agonist or partial agonist of a second receptor (or enzyme). A therapeutic agent can include one or more pharmacophores, which can have the same or different biochemical activities. </p>[0019] The term \u201cbivalent ligand\u201d also describes a compound that is not dimeric, as can be broadly defined as a molecule that contains two recognition units linked through a spacer. </p>[0020] The term \u201cantagonist\u201d may be generally defined as a substance that tends to nullify the action of another, i.e., as a drug that binds to a cell receptor without eliciting",

Cells were lysed by nitrogen cavitation and membranes were collected through differential centrifugation and resuspended in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 8, 250 mM sucrose, 0.1 mM EDTA and a protease inhibitor cocktail for a final protein concentration of 5-10 mg/mL. Competition binding assays were performed essentially as described in a volume of 2 mL using 10 \u03bcL membrane (50-100 \u03bcg of protein), 200 pM [<sup>3</sup>H]QNB (approx. 20,000 cpm/assay) and various concentrations of competing drugs (1 or compounds 4-9, 12 or 13) in binding buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EDTA). See FIG. 2. Incubations were for 90 min at 30\u00b0 C. The assays were terminated by addition of 4 mL of wash buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>), quick filtration over Whatman GF/A filters, and two washes with 4 mL of wash buffer. The filters were placed into scintillation vials with 5 mL of scintillation fluid and radioactivity quantitated. FIG. 2 depicts a competition binding assay at the human M1 and M2 receptors: Increasing amounts of the indicated analogue were incubated with [<sup>3</sup>H]QNB and membranes expressing either the M1 (A) or M2 (B) muscarinic receptor. The data shown include atropine marked as (\u00d7), and compounds 4 (\u25b4), 5 (\u25a1), 6 (\u25be), 7 (\u22c4), 8 (\u2666), 9 (\u2218), 12 (\ue8a0), and 13 (\u25aa) marked accordingly. The data shown are representative of three independent experiments performed in duplicate for both M1 and M2 receptors. </p>[0131] Table 1 show below illustrates the binding Affinities of compounds 4-9, 12 and 13 to human muscarinic receptors.  \nTABLE 1CompoundhMl receptorhM2 receptorNo.Ki<sup>a</sup>Ki<sup>a</sup>4\u20031008 \u00b1 68 nM2850 \u00b1 179 nM5\u2002<sup>\u2009</sup>202.5 \u00b1 83 nM84.3 \u00b1 8.1 nM610333 \u00b1 2375 nM7347 \u00b1 1092 nM716810 \u00b1 15190 nM<sup>b</sup>23900 \u00b1 13670 nM812430 \u00b1 3744 nM47570 \u00b1 14790 nM9&gt;100 \u03bcM<sup>c</sup>&gt;100 \u03bcM<sup>c</sup>12\u2002&gt;100 \u03bcM<sup>c</sup>&gt;100 \u03bcM<sup>c</sup>13\u2002&gt;100 \u03bcM<sup>c</sup>&gt;100 \u03bcM<sup>c</sup>Atropine (1)0.43 \u00b1 0.1 nM6.00 \u00b1 1.1 nM\u2003a\ue89eKi\ue89e\u2003\ue89evalues\ue89e\u2003\ue89ewere\ue89e\u2003\ue89ecalculated\ue89e\u2003\ue89eaccording\ue89e\u2003\ue89eto\ue89e\u2003\ue89ethe\ue89e\u2003\ue89eformula\ue89e\u2003Ki=IC501+[[3\ue89eH]\ue89eQNB]KD\u2003<img id=\"EMI-M00001\" path=\"US20040029911A1-20040212-M00001.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/24320580/US/20040212/A1/020040/02/99/11/US20040029911A1-20040212-M00001.TIF\"/> where IC<sub>50 </sub>is the concentration of competing analogue that inhibited[<sup>3</sup>H]QNB binding by 50%, [[<sup>3</sup>H]QNB] is theconcentration of [<sup>3</sup>H]QNB in the binding assay, and K<sub>D </sub>is theK<sub>D </sub>of [<sup>3</sup>H]QNB.

See FIG. 3. M1 receptor activity was determined by measuring activation of the G\u03b1<sub>q </sub>effector, phospholipase C-\u03b2. Recombinant human M1 receptor was expressed (48 h) from a baculovirus in Sf9 insect cells. The inositol lipid pool of cells was radiolabeled by incubating the cells overnight in inositol-free Grace's medium containing 1 \u03bcCi of myo-[<sup>3</sup>H]inositol. The medium was supplemented with 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, and 10 mM LiCl (final concentration) and placed in a 27\u00b0 C. bath for 10 min prior to assay. The assay was initiated by addition of the appropriate ligand(s) and incubations continued for 20 min. The assay was terminated by aspirating the medium and adding 750 \u03bcL of ice-cold 50 mM formic acid. After 30 min at 4\u00b0 C., the samples were neutralized with 250 \u03bcL of 150 mM NH<sub>4</sub>OH. [<sup>3</sup>H]Inositol phosphates were isolated by ion exchange chromatography on Dowex AG 1-X8 columns and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. FIG. 3 demonstrates a functional activity of analogues at the human M1 receptor: The accumulation of [<sup>3</sup>H]inositol phosphates in Sf9 cells expressing the M1 muscarinic receptor was measured in response to 100 \u03bcM carbachol (Carb) or compound 4, 5, or 6 or with 100 \u03bcM carbachol with increasing amounts of compound 5. The data shown in FIG. 3 are the results of an experiment performed in triplicate",
    " from these cells were treated with 8 M urea to remove all non-integral proteins from the membrane. The membranes were washed and resuspended in reconstitution buffer (25 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin). A membrane suspension containing approximately 200 fmol of receptor was pre-incubated with 1 \u03bcM AMP-PNP for 15 min at 4\u00b0 C. Purified G\u03b1<sub>i1 </sub>and \u03b2<sub>1\u03b32 </sub>were added to a final concentration of 10 nM followed by the addition of concentrated GDP for a final concentration of 50 nM. This mix was incubated for 45 min at 4\u00b0 C. The assay was initiated by the addition of the appropriate ligand followed by [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP\u03b3S to a final concentration of approximately 7 nM and the incubation continued at 25\u00b0 C. for 2 min. Membranes were collected by vacuum filtration using GF/A filters and radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. FIG. 4 illustrates the functional activity of analogues at the human M2 receptor: [<sup>35 </sup>S]GTP\u03b3S binding assays were carried out in Sf9 cell membranes expressing the M2 muscarinic receptor in the presence of increasing concentrations of carbachol (Carb) or 100 \u03bcM of compound 4, 5, or 6. The data shown in FIG. 4 are the result of an experiment performed in triplicate. </p>[0134] It was additionally observed that exo-8-benzyloxymethyl-3-ethoxycarbonyl-4-hydroxy-1-azabicyclo[3.3.1]non-3-ene (compound 5) functioned as a muscarinic receptor antagonist with a Ki only 14-fold greater than atropine at the human M2 receptor. It may be possible for these compounds to act as partial agonists or agonists at these receptors as well. </p>[0135] Muscarinic M1 through M5 Binding Assay. </p>[0136] COS-7 cells were subcultured in 150 mm dishes to a density of 20,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. The cells were transfected with Fugene 6 transfection reagent (according to manufacturer's specifications) and pcDNA3.1 DNA containing sequence coding for hM1, hM2, hM3, hM4, or hM5 receptor (approximately 20 \u03bcg DNA/150 mm dish). Cell lysates were harvested after 24 hr by scraping the cells and sonicating in buffer (5 mM Tris pH 7.5, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and protease inhibitors). Membranes were isolated by differential centrifugation and resuspended in freezing buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 8, 250 mM sucrose, 0.1 mM EDTA, and protease inhibitors). Binding assays were carried out as previously described. FIG. 7 depicts a competitive binding assay at the M<sub>1</sub>-M<sub>5 </sub>receptors for atropine and many of the ligands (100 \u03bcM) of the present invention as labeled. </p>[0137] The foregoing is illustrative of the present invention, and is not to be construed as limiting thereof.
