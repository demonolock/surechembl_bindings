    "istration to a person to be treated.</p>If the composition is provided in liquid form, the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier will typically comprise one or more (compatible) pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carriers. The composition may comprise as (compatible) pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carriers e.g. pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline or buffered (aqueous) solutions, e.g phosphate, citrate etc. buffered solutions, vegetable oils, such as, for example, groundnut oil, cottonseed oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and oil from theobroma; polyols, such as, for example, polypropylene glycol, glycerol, sorbitol, mannitol and polyethylene glycol; alginic acid, etc. Particularly for injection of the inventive pharmaceutical composition, a buffer, preferably an aqueous buffer, may be used, containing a sodium salt, preferably at least 50 mM of a sodium salt, a calcium salt, preferably at least 0.01 mM of a calcium salt, and optionally a potassium salt, preferably at least 3 mM of a potassium salt. According to a preferred embodiment, the sodium, calcium and, optionally, potassium salts may occur in the form of their halogenides, e.g. chlorides, iodides, or bromides, in the form of their hydroxides, carbonates, hydrogen carbonates, or sulfates, etc. Without being limited thereto, examples of sodium salts include e.g. NaCl, NaI, NaBr, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, examples of the optional potassium salts include e.g. KCl, KI, KBr, K<sub>2</sub>CO, KHCO<sub>3</sub>, K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and examples of calcium salts include e.g. CaCl<sub>2</sub>, Cal<sub>2</sub>, CaBr<sub>2</sub>, CaCO<sub>3</sub>, CaSO<sub>4</sub>, Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, organic anions of the aforementioned cations may be contained in the buffer. According to a more preferred embodiment, the buffer suitable for injection purposes as defined above, may contain salts selected from sodium chloride (NaCl), calcium chloride (CaCl<sub>2</sub>) and optionally potassium chloride (KCl), wherein further anions may be present additional to the chlorides. Typically, the salts in the injection buffer are present in a concentration of at least 50 mM sodium chloride (NaCl), at least 3 mM potassium chloride (KCl) and at least 0.01 mM calcium chloride (CaCl<sub>2</sub>). The injection buffer may be hypertonic, isotonic or hypotonic with reference to the specific reference medium, i.e. the buffer may have a higher, identical or lower salt content with reference to the specific reference medium, wherein preferably such concentrations of the afore mentioned salts may be used, which do not lead to damage of cells due to osmosis or other concentration effects. Reference media are e.g. in, in vivo\u201d methods occurring liquids such as blood, lymph, cytosolic liquids, or other body liquids, or e.g. liquids, which may be used as reference media in \u201cin vitro\u201d methods, such as common buffers or liquids. Such common buffers or liquids are "
