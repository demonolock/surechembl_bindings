J Pharmacol Exp Ther., 319( 1 ):254-259 (2006), with slight modifications. </p> A test compound was suspended in 0.25 % CMC, unless otherwise specified, and this solution was orally administered to male SWISS albino mice (7 to 9 week old). 15 min later, the mice were placed in a water tank having a water depth of 15 cm and a water temperature of 25\u00b11 \u00b0C and immediately thereafter allowed to swim for 6 min. Then, a time during which the mouse was immobile (immobility time) was measured for the last 4 min. </p> In this experiment, the animals treated with the test compounds exhibited a reduction in immobility time. This demonstrates that the test compounds are useful as antidepressants. </p> Cleversys Software (Forced Swim Scan) was used for carrying out Forced Swim</p>Test in mice. </p> Table III: Forced Swim Test results \n\n \n\n\n\n </p> z Vehicle - De-ionized water </p>In vitro Studies </p> Binding assay </p>1.
