HUVECs proliferation assay with the Flt-1(D2) constructs with 9Gly, Ex3 and CH3 combinations. Conditioned media from 293 cells (5 ul) containing proteins D2-Ex3/CH3, D2-9Gly-CH3 and D2-CH3 were compared to D2-9Gly-Fc and D2-9Gly-Ex3/CH3.</p>FIG. 10 Western blot. 293 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing: (1) D2-9Gly-Fc; (2) D2-9Gly-CH3 (52/26 kDa); and (3) D2-CH3 (50/25 kDa). Proteins from 293 cells conditioned medium (15 ul of CM non-reduced and/or reduced) were separated by SDS-electrophoresis and transferred to PVDF membrane. The blot was probed with anti-human VEGF-R1 HRP conjugate (R&amp;D Systems).</p>FIG. 11. VEGF \u201cin vitro\u201d binding assay. Conditioned media from 293 cells containing known concentrations of both D2-9Gly-Fc and Flt-1 D(1-3) control soluble receptors (ranging in concentrations from 0.29-150 pM) were serially diluted and mixed with 10 pM VEGF. The amount of unbound VEGF was then measured by ELISA. D2-9Gly-Fc binds VEGF with higher affinity than all other constructs. \u201cn\u201d represents the number of independent experiments (transfection and binding assay).</p>FIG. 12. The binding kinetics of the soluble Flt-1 constructs were measured by surface plasmon resonance with a BIAcore instrument. sFlt-1 constructs were immobilized onto a sensor chip, and VEGF165 was injected at concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 15 nM. The sensorgrams were evaluated using the BIA Evaluation program, the rate constants Ka and Kd were determined and the dissociation constant (KID) calculated from the ratio of Kd/Ka=KD. The lower KD value means better affinity.</p>FIG. 13A-13C. FIG. 13A shows expression levels of Flt-1 constructs having various linkers. FIG. 13B shows dimerization or multimerization of Flt-1 constructs having various linkers and a CH3 moiety of Fc of IgG1. The difference between the non-reduced and the reduced conditions indicates that the proteins had multimerized. FIG. 13C shows the inhibitory bioactivity of indicated Flt-1 constructs present in condition medium in a HUVEC proliferation assay in the presence of VEGF. Each of the constructs demonstrated inhibitory activity approaching proliferation levels of the HUVEC in the absence of VEGF.</p>FIG. 14. Using a murine oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model of retinal neovascularization (NV), one of the Flt-1 constructs was administered to the mouse eyes and neovascularization was determined. The mice were exposed to hyperoxic conditions. The number of neovascular events was determined in the treated eyes compared to the events in the untreated eyes of the same animals. The animal was considered a \u201cresponder\u201d if there was a greater than 50% reduction in neovascular events.</p>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONIt is a discovery of the present inventors that a Flt-1 Ig-like domain 2 without domains 1 and 3 is capable of efficiently binding VEGF and inhibiting VEGF-dependent endothelial cell proliferation. Domain 2 can be covalently linked to a multimerization domain via a linker. Linkers are typically polypeptide chains. The length o",

Both constructs are present mostly in a dimer form and the monomer forms were detected after separation of reduced samples.</p>Example 6Role of 9Gly or VEGF Ex3 in Flt-1 (D2) Constructs</p>In order to investigate the role of 9Gly linker or VEGF dimerizing sequence Ex3 on soluble receptor VEGF binding, three other constructs were generated: D2-9Gly-CH3, D2-CH3 and D2-Ex3/CH3 (FIG. 8). All three constructs were generated and like all the previous constructs were also put under control of CMV promoter. Their VEGF blocking activity was assessed in HUVECs proliferation assay (FIG. 9).</p>The HUVEC proliferation assay of proteins containing the CH3 region of IgG1 has shown that D2-9Gly-CH3 (without Ex3) and protein D2-Ex3/CH3 (without 9Gly linker) had similar VEGF blocking potency as compared to the parental D2-9GlyEx3/CH3 protein. However, protein D2-CH3 appeared to be the weakest VEGF inhibitor from all of them (FIG. 9).</p>The Flt-1 ELISA data of conditioned media from transfected 293 cells has shown similar Flt-1 levels for D2-9Gly-Ex3/CH3, D2-9Gly-CH3 and D2-Ex3/CH3 and D2CH3 (70-90 ng/ml) and a little higher (\u2212150 ng/ml) for the least active form of D2CH3. Western blot of D2-9Gly-CH3 and D2-CH3 constructs (FIG. 10) is showing a prevalence of dimer forms in non-reduced conditions.</p>Example 7D2-9Gly-Fc binds VEGF Better than all Constructs</p>VEGF binding assay allows us to compare the relative VEGF binding affinities of our soluble VEGF receptors in a cell free system.</p>Briefly, conditioned media containing known concentrations of soluble receptor (ranging in concentrations from 0.29-150 pM) were serially diluted and mixed with 10 pM VEGF. The amount of unbound VEGF was then measured by ELISA. D2-9Gly-Fc binds VEGF with higher affinity to bind VEGF at receptor concentrations from 0.001 to \u22120.2 pM than all other constructs. D2-CH3 has the lowest affinity to bind VEGF (FIG. 11).</p>REFERENCESDavis-Smyth, et al., EMBO J., 15, 1996, 4919Huston, J. S., et al. (1991) Methods Enzymol. 203, 46-88Huston, J. S., et al.
