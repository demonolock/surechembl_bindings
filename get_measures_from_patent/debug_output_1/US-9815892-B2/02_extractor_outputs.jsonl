Conditioned media from 293 cells containing known concentrations of both D2-9Gly-Fc and Flt-1 D(1-3) control soluble receptors (ranging in concentrations from 0.29-150 pM) were serially diluted and mixed with 10 pM VEGF. \nFIG. 12. The binding kinetics of the soluble Flt-1 constructs were measured by surface plasmon resonance with a BIAcore instrument. sFlt-1 constructs were immobilized onto a sensor chip, and VEGF165 was injected at concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 15 nM."}
