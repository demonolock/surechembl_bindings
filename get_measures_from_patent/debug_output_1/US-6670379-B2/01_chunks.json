    "inbefore defined, with a solid phase substrate Z having a group, such as an aldehyde group, reactive with amino. Such solid phase substrates, including modified resins, particularly modified polystyrene resins, are commercially available. Compounds of formula X are known or may be prepared by known methods.</p>Compounds of formula I in free form may be converted into salt form, and vice versa, in a conventional manner. The compounds in free or salt form can be obtained in the form of hydrates or solvates containing a solvent used for crystallization. Compounds of formula I can be recovered from reaction mixtures and purified in a conventional manner. Isomers, such as enantiomers, may be obtained in a conventional manner, e.g. by fractional crystallization or asymmetric synthesis from correspondingly asymmetrically substituted, e.g. optically active, starting materials.</p>Compounds of formula I in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form, hereinafter referred to alternatively as agents of the invention, are useful as pharmaceuticals. Accordingly the invention also provides a compound of formula I in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form for use as a pharmaceutical. The agents of the invention act as CCR-3 receptor antagonists, thereby inhibiting the infiltration and activation of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, and inhibiting allergic response. The inhibitory properties of agents of the invention can be demonstrated in the following assay:</p>CCR-3 Binding Assay</p>In this assay the effect of agents of the invention on the binding of human eotaxin to human CCR-3 is determined. Recombinant cells expressing human CCR-3 are captured by wheatgerm agglutinin (WGA) polyvinyltoluidene (PVT) SPA beads (available from Amersham), through a specific interaction between the WGA and carbohydrate residues of glycoproteins on the surface of the cells. [<sup>125</sup>I]-human eotaxin (available from Amersham) binds specifically to CCR-3 receptors bringing the [<sup>125</sup>I]-human eotaxin in close proximity to the SPA beads. Emitted \u00e2-particles from the [<sup>125</sup>I]-human eotaxin excite, by its proximity, the fluorophore in the beads and produce light. Free [<sup>125</sup>I]-human eotaxin in solution is not in close proximity to the scintillant and hence does not produce light. The scintillation count is therefore a measure of the extent to which the test compound inhibits binding of the eotaxin to the CCR-3.</p>Preparation of Assay Buffer: 5.96 g HEPES and 7.0 g sodium chloride are dissolved in distilled water and 1M aqueous CaCl<sub>2 </sub>(1 mL) and 1M aqueous MgCl<sub>2 </sub>(5 mL) are added. The pH is adjusted to 7.6 with NaOH and the solution made to a final volume of 1 L using distilled water. 5 g bovine serum albumin and 0.1 g sodium azide are then dissolved in the solution and the resulting buffer stored at 4\u00b0 C. A Complete\u2122 protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (available from Boehringer) is added per 50 mL of the buffe",
    "nergic receptor. The inhibitory properties of agents of the invention on binding of the alpha-1 adrenergic receptor can be determined in the following assay:</p>Cerebral cortices from male Sprague-Dawley rats (175-200 g) are dissected and homogenised in 10 volumes of ice cold 0.32 M sucrose (containing 1 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>dihydrate and 1 mM K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>) with a glass/teflon homogeniser. The membranes are centrifuged at 1000\u00d7g for 15 min., the pellet discarded and the centrifugation repeated. The supernatants are pooled and centrifuged at 18,000\u00d7g for 15 min. The pellet is osmotically shocked in 10 volumes of water and kept on ice for 30 min. The suspension is centrifuged at 39,000\u00d7g for 20 min., resuspended in Krebs-Henseleit buffer pH 7.4 (1.17 mM MgSO<sub>4 </sub>anhydrous, 4.69 mM KCl, 0.7 mM K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4 </sub>anhydrous, 0.11M NaCl, 11 mM D-glucose and 25 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) containing 20 mM Tris, and kept for 2 days at \u221220\u00b0 C. The membranes are then thawed at 20-23\u00b0 C., washed three times with Krebs-Henseleit buffer by centrifugation at 18,000\u00d7g for 15 min., left overnight at 4\u00b0 C. and washed again three times. The final pellet is resuspended with a glass/teflon homogeniser in 125 mL/100 membranes in the same buffer. A sample is taken to determine the protein concentration (using the Bradford Assay with gamma globulin as the standard) and the remainder aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C.</p>The resulting membranes are subjected to a radioligand binding assay. The assay is conducted in triplicate using 96 well plates containing [<sup>125</sup>I]-HEAT (Amersham) (40 pM, K<sub>d</sub>: 58.9\u00b118.7 pM), unlabelled test compound and membrane (57.1 \u03bcg/mL) to yield a final volume of 250 \u03bcl (assay buffer containing 50 mM Tris-base and 0.9% (w/v) NaCl, pH 7.4). The plates are incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 60 min., after which rapid vacuum filtration over Whatman GF/C 96 well filter plates is carried out. Each plate is then washed three times with 10 ml of ice cold assay buffer using a Brandel Cell harvester (Gaithersburg, Md.). Following drying of the plates for 3 h. at 50\u00b0 C., 40 \u03bcL of Microscint 20 is added to each well, the plates incubated at room temperature for a further 20 min. and the retained radioactivity quantified in a Packard Topcount NXT scintillation counter.</p>Stock solutions of test compounds are dissolved initially in 100% DMSO and diluted with assay buffer to the required concentrations to yield 1% (v/v) DMSO.</p>The concentration of test compound at which 50% inhibition occurs (IC<sub>50</sub>) is determined from concentration-inhibition curves in a conventional manner. Compounds of Examples 1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 13, 20, 23, 25, 28, 30, 38, 40, 43 and 44 have IC<sub>50</sub>(nM) values of 210, 221, 94, 48, 58, 53, 89, 131, 387, 72, 121, 1519, 215, 356 and 331 in this assay.</p>Having regard to their inhibition of binding of CCR-3, agents of the invention are useful in the treatment of conditions mediated by CCR-3, part"
