    "ine transport function in a subject, can result in an increase in the concentration of physiologically active noradrenaline. It is understood that NorAdrenergic Reuptake Inhibitor and NorEpinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor (NERI) are synonymous with NorAdrenaline Reuptake Inhibitor (NARI).</p>As used herein, noradrenaline transporter refers to naturally occurring noradrenaline transporters (e.g., mammalian noradrenaline transporters (e.g., human (Homo sapiens) noradrenaline transporters, murine (e.g., rat, mouse) noradrenaline transporters)) and to proteins having an amino acid sequence which is the same as that of a corresponding naturally occurring noradrenaline transporter (e.g., recombinant proteins). The term includes naturally occurring variants, such as polymorphic or allelic variants and splice variants.</p>In certain embodiments, the NARI can inhibit the binding of a ligand (e.g., a natural ligand such as noradrenaline, or other ligand such as nisoxetine) to a noradrenaline transporter, hi other embodiments, the NARI can bind to a noradrenaline transporter. For example, in a preferred embodiment, the NARI can bind to a noradrenaline transporter, thereby inhibiting binding of a ligand to said \n\ntransporter and inhibiting transport of said ligand. In another preferred embodiment, the NARI can bind to a noradrenaline transporter, and thereby inhibit transport.</p>The NARI activity of a compound can be determined employing suitable assays. More specifically, to determine the inhibition constant (Ki) for noradrenaline reuptake, an assay which monitors inhibition of noradrenaline (NA) uptake can be used. For example, radiolabelled noradrenaline, such as [<sup>3</sup>H]NA and the test compound of interest can be incubated under conditions suitable for uptake with brain tissue or a suitable fraction thereof, for example, a synaptosomal fraction from rat brain tissue (harvested and isolated in accordance with generally accepted techniques), and the amount of uptake of [<sup>3</sup>H]NA in the tissue or fraction can be determined (e.g., by liquid scintillation spectrometry). IC<sub>50</sub> values can be calculated by nonlinear regression analysis. The inhibition constants, Ki values, can then be calculated from the IC<sub>50</sub> values using the Cheng-Prusoff equation:</p>Ki =_ IC \u25a050- l + ([ j7K<sub>d</sub>)</p>wherein [L] = the concentration of free radioligand used in the assay and K<sub>d</sub> = the equilibrium dissociation constant of the radioligand. To detennine the non-specific uptake, incubations can be performed by following the same assay, but in the absence of test compound at 4\u00b0C (i.e., under conditions not suitable for uptake). In a preferred embodiment, NARI activity is determined using the radioligand uptake assay described above, according to the procedure detailed in Eguchi et al, Arzneim.-Forschung/Drug Res., 47(12): 1337-47 (1997).</p>Specifically, rats are decapitated and the cortical, hypothalamic, hippocampal and striatal tissues are rapidly dissected. The tissues are homogenized (Potter homogenizer with Teflon pestle) in 10 volumes of ice cold 0.32 mol/L sucrose. The P<sub>2</sub> fraction is obtained by centrifugation at 1000 x g for 10 minutes and 11500 x g for 20 minutes and suspended in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (124 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L KC1, 20 mmol/L N^HPO 1.2 mmol/L KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.3 \n\nmmol/L MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.75 mmol/L CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mmol/L glucose). The [<sup>3</sup>H]NA uptake assays are performed on the cortical and hypothalamic synaptosomes.</p>The assay tubes contain radiolabled noradrenaline, [<sup>3</sup>H]NA, in a volume of 0.2 mL, compounds at 5 or more concentrations in a volume of 0.1 mL, and the oxygenated buffer described above in a volume of 0.5 mL. After 5 minutes preincubation at 37 \u00b0C, uptake is initiated by the addition of the synaptosomal fraction in volume of 0.2 mL. The final concentration of [<sup>3</sup>H]NA in the incubation mixtures is 0.25 \u03bcmol/L. The reaction is stopped after 5 minutes by filtration through Whatman GF/B glass fiber filter under a vacuum with a cell harvester. The filter is rinsed three times with 4 mL of saline and placed in a scintillation vial containing 10 mL of Atomlight (Du Pont/NEN Research Products). Radioactivity is measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. For determination of non-specific uptake, incubations are performed at 4 \u00b0C without the addition of test compounds. IC<sub>50</sub> values are calculated by nonlinear regression analysis. Inhibitor constants, Ki values, are calculated from the IC<sub>50</sub> values using the Cheng-Prusoff equation.</p>NARI compounds suitable for use in the invention have a Ki value for NARI activity of about 500 nmol/L or less, such as about 250 nmol/L or less, for example, about 100 nmol/L or less. It is preferred that the Ki value for NARI activity be about 100 nmol/L or less. It is understood that the exact value of the Ki for a particular compound can vary depending on the assay conditions employed for determination (e.g., radioligand and tissue source). As such, it is preferred that the NARI activity be assessed essentially according to the radioligand binding assay described in Eguchi et al, Arzneim.-Forschung/Drug Res., 47(12): 1331-Al (1997) and discussed in detail above. In addition, to possessing sufficient NARI activity, it is preferred that the</p>NARI compounds possess one or more characteristics selected from the group consisting of: a. the substantial absence of anticholinergic effects; b. the selective inhibition of noradrenaline reuptake as compared to inhibition of serotonin reuptake; and \n\n c. the selective inhibition of noradrenaline reuptake as compared to inhibition of dopamine reuptake.</p>Selective inhibition of noradrenaline reuptake as compared to inhibition of serotonin or dopamine reuptake can be determined by comparing the Ki values for the respective reuptake inhibitions. The inhibition constants for serotonin and dopamine reuptake can be determined as described above for nordrenaline, but employing the appropriate radioligand and tissue for the activity being assessed (e.g., [<sup>3</sup>H] 5-HT for serotonin, using e.g., hypothalamic or cortical tissue and [<sup>3</sup>H]DA for dopamine (DA), using e.g., striatal tissue). A preferred method of determining serotonin reuptake inhibition and dopaminergic reuptake inhibition is described in Eguchi et al, Arzneim.- Forschung/Drug Res., 47(12): 1331-Al (1997). Specifically, rats are decapitated and the cortical, hypothalamic, hippocampal and striatal tissues are rapidly dissected. The tissues are homogenized (Potter homogenizer with Teflon pestle) in 10 volumes of ice cold 0.32 mol/L sucrose. The P<sub>2</sub> fraction is obtained by centrifugation at 1000 x g for 10 minutes and 11500 x g for 20 minutes and suspended in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (124 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L KC1, 20 mmol/L Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 1.2 mmol/L KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.3 mmol/L MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.75 mmol/L CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mmol/L glucose). The [<sup>3</sup>H]5-HT uptake assays are performed on the cortical, hypothalamic and hippocampal synaptosomes, and the [<sup>3</sup>H]DA uptake assays are perfonned on striatal synaptosomes.</p>The assay tubes contain the appropriate radiolabled ligand (i.e., [<sup>3</sup>H]5-HT or [<sup>3</sup>H]DA), in a volume of 0.2 mL, compounds at 5 or more concentrations in a volume of 0.1 mL, and the oxygenated buffer described above in a volume of 0.5 mL. After 5 minutes preincubation at 37 \u00b0C, uptake is initiated by the addition of the synaptosomal fraction in volume of 0.2 mL. The final concentration of [<sup>3</sup>H]DA in the striatal incubation mixtures is 0.4 \u03bcmol/L. The final concentrations of [<sup>3</sup>H]5- HT in the cortical, hypothalamic and hippocampal synaptosome incubation mixtures are 0.02 \u03bcmol/L, 0.04 \u03bcmol/L and 0.08 \u03bcmol/L. The reaction is stopped after 5 minutes ([<sup>3</sup>H]5-HT) or 3 minutes [<sup>3</sup>H]DA by filtration through Whatman GF/B glass \n\nfiber filter under a vacuum with a cell harvester. The filter is rinsed three times with 4 mL of saline and placed in a scintillation vial containing 10 mL of Atomlight (Du Pont/NEN Research Products). Radioactivity is measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. For determination of non-specific uptake incubations are perfomied at 4 \u00b0C without the addition of test compounds. IC<sub>50</sub> values are calculated by nonlinear regression analysis. Inhibition constants, Ki values, are calculated from the IC<sub>50</sub> values using the Cheng-Prusoff equation.</p>Following determination of the Ki values for inhibition of noradrenaline, serotonin and/or dopamine uptake, the ratio of the activities can be determined. Selective inhibition of noradrenaline reuptake as compared to inhibition of serotonin reuptake and/or dopaminergic reuptake, refers to a compound having a Ki value for inhibition of serotonin (re)uptake and/or dopamine (re)uptake which is about 10 times or more than the Ki for inhibition of noradrenaline (re)uptake. That is, the ratio, Ki inhibition of serotonin (re)uptake / Ki inhibition of noradrenaline (re)uptake, is about 10 or more, such as about 15 or more, about 20 or more, for example, about 30, 40 or 50 or more. Likewise, the ratio, Ki inhibition of dopamine (re)uptake / Ki inhibition noradrenaline (re)uptake, is about 10 or more, such as about 15 or more, about 20 or more, for example, about 30, 40 or 50 or more.</p>It is preferred that the Ki values for comparison are determined according to the method of Eguchi et al., discussed in detail above. It is most preferred, that the Ki values for NARI activity and inhibition of serotonin reuptake activity, which are compared to determine selective inhibition are determined according to the method of Eguchi et al. using a synaptosomal preparation from rat hypothalamic tissue. Further, it is most preferred, that the Ki values for NARI activity and inhibition of dopamine reuptake activity, which are compared to detennine selective inhibition are determined according to the method of Eguchi et al. using a synaptosomal preparation from rat hypothalamic tissue for inhibition of noradrenaline uptake and from rat striatal tissue for inhibition of dopamine uptake.</p>In another embodiment, the NARI is characterized by the substantial absence of anticholinergic effects. As used herein, substantial absence of anticholinergic effects, refers to a compound which has an IC<sub>50</sub> value for binding to muscarinic \n\nreceptors of about 1 \u03bcmol/L or more. The IC<sub>50</sub> value for binding to muscarinic receptors can be determined using a suitable assay, such as an assay which determines the ability of a compound to inliibit the binding of suitable radioligand to muscarinic receptors. A preferred assay for determination of the IC<sub>50</sub> value for binding of a compound to muscarinic receptors is described in Eguchi et al, Arzneim.-Forschung/Drug Res., 47(12): 1337-47 (1997).</p>Specifically, the binding assays for determination of binding to muscarinic receptors can be performed on tissue isolated from the rat cerebral cortex. The buffer is any suitable buffer, for example, 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH=7.4. The preferred radiolabeled ligand is [<sup>3</sup>H]QNB (3-quinuclidinyl benzilate) which is present in a final concentration of 0.2 nmol/L. The test compound is added at various concentrations",
    "f a compound to inhibit radioligand binding to 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor (see, for example, Eguchi et al, \n\nArzneim.-Forschung/Drug Res., 47(12): 1337-47 (1997) and G. Kilpatrick et al, Nature, 330: 746-748 (1987)) and/or by their effect on the 5-HT<sub>3</sub>-induced von Bezold-Jarisch (B-J) reflex in the cat or rat (following the general methods described by Butler et al, Br. J. Pharmacol, 94: 397-412 (1988) and Ito et al, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 280(1): 67-72 (1997), respectively).</p>In a preferred embodiment, 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist activity of a compound can be determined according to the method described in Eguchi et al, Arzneim.- Forschung/Drug Res., 47(12): 1331-Al (1997). Specifically, e binding assays for determination of binding to the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor can be performed on N1E-115 mouse neuroblastoma cells (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) Accession No. CRL-2263) in 20 mmol/L HEPES buffer (pH=7.4) containing 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.35 mmol/L of radiolabeled ligand ([<sup>3</sup>H]GR65630) and the test compound at 6 or more concentrations at 25 \u00b0C for 60 minutes. The reaction is terminated by rapid vacuum filtration onto glass fiber filter. Radioactivity trapped on the filter is measured by scintillation spectrometry. Non-specific binding is detennined using 1 \u03bcmol/L of MDL-7222 (endo-8-methyl-8-azabicyclo [3.2.1]oct-3-yl-3,5- dichlorobenzoate. IC<sub>50</sub> values are calculated by nonlinear regression analysis. The affinity constants, Ki values, are calculated from the IC<sub>50</sub> values using the Cheng- Prusoff equation. Compounds having 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist activity which are suitable for use in the invention have an affinity for 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor (Ki) of not more than about 250 times the Ki of ondansetron for 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor. This relative activity to ondansetron (Ki of test agent for 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor / Ki of ondansetron for 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor), can be determined by assaying the compound of interest and ondansetron using a suitable assay under controlled conditions, for example, conditions which differ primarily in the agent being tested. It is preferred that the relative activity of the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist activity be not more than about 200 times that of ondansetron, for example, not more than about 150 times that of ondansetron, such as not more than about 100 times that of ondansetron, for example, not more than about 50 times that of ondansetron. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the \n\ncompou\u03aed having 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist activity has a relative activity to ondansetron of not more than about 10.</p>In certain embodiments, the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist can be selected from indisetron, YM-114 ((R)-2,3-dihydro-l-[(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-lH-benzimidazol- 5-yl-)carb6nyl]-lH-indole), granisetron, talipexole, azasetron, bemesetron, tropisetron, ramosetron, ondansetron, palonosetron, lerisetron, alosetron, N-3389, zacopride, cilansetron, E-3620 ([3(S)-endo]-4-amino-5-chloro-N-(8-methyl-8- azabicyclo[3.2.1-]oct-3-yl-2[(l-methyl-2-butynyl)oxy]benzamide), lintopride, KAE- 393, itasetron, zatosetron, dolasetron, (\u00b1)-zacopride, (\u00b1)-renzapride, (-)-YM-060, DAU-6236, BIMU-8 and GK-128 [2-[2-methylimidazol-l-yl)methyl]- benzo[ ]thiochromen-l-one monohydrochloride hemihydrate].</p>In preferred embodiments, the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> recepto",
    "e compounds represented by structural Formulas I and II are useful for treating nausea, vomiting, retching or any combination thereof by virtue of the dual therapeutic modes of action which they can exhibit. That is, the unique ability to modulate the function of both the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor and the noradrenaline reuptake mechanism can provide an enhanced treatment regimen for the subject undergoing treatment.</p>In a preferred embodiment, compounds having 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist activity and NARI activity, such as the compounds of Formula I and II possess one or more characteristics selected from the group consisting of: a) the substantial absence of anticholinergic effects; b) the selective inhibition of noradrenaline reuptake as compared to inhibition of serotonin reuptake; and \n\n c) the selective inhibition of noradrenaline reuptake as compared to inhibition of dopamine reuptake.</p>For example, the specific compound MCI -225 has been shown to be a selective NARI and a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist with substantially no anticholinergic activity. Eguchi et \u03b1/., Arzneim.-Forschung/Drug Res., 47(12): 1337-47 (1997), reported inhibition constants for MCI-225 for the uptake the [<sup>3</sup>H]monoamine neurotransmitters noradrenaline, serotonin and dopamine in various rat brain tissues. More specifically, MCI-225 inhibited the uptake of [<sup>3</sup>H]NA and [<sup>3</sup>H]5-HT by synaptosomes from rat hypothalamic tissue with inhibition constants of Ki=35.0 nmol/L and Ki=491 mnol/L, respectively. In addition, MCI-225 inhibited the uptake of [<sup>3</sup>H]NA and [<sup>3</sup>H]5-HT by synaptosomes from rat cortical tissue with inhibition constants of Ki=0.696 mnol/L and Ki=1070 nmol/L, respectively. MCI-225 was also reported to inhibit the uptake of serotonin by synaptosomes from rat hippocampal tissue with an inhibition constant of Ki=244 mnol/L. Further, the MCI-225 inhibition constant for the uptake of [<sup>3</sup>H]D A by synaptosomes from rat striatal tissue was reported as Ki=l 4,800. MCI-225 did not inhibit Monoamine Oxidase-A (MAO-A) and Monoamine Oxidase-B (MAO-B) activities.</p>With regard to 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist activity, Eguchi et al. reported that MCI-225 showed high affinity for the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor (Ki less than 100 nmol/L) in comparison to the other receptors tested. In addition, MCI-225 showed affinity for the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor similar to that reported for ondansetron in the same radioligand binding assay. Briefly, the inhibition of radiolabeled ligand binding by MCI-225, using a suitable radioligand and tissue combination for the receptor of interest was determined. The receptors tested included, \u03b1<sub>]5 2</sub>, \u03b2\u201e \u03b2<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>l5</sub> 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>lc</sub>, 5- HT<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, 5-HT<sub>4</sub>, 5-HT<sub>6</sub>, 5-HT<sub>7</sub>, D<sub>l5</sub> D<sub>2</sub>, Muscarinic, M<sub>l5</sub> M<sub>2</sub>, M<sub>3</sub>, Nicotonic, H<sub>ls</sub> H<sub>2</sub>, GABA-A, GABA-B, BZP, Opiate non-selective, Opiate K, Opiate \u03bc, Opiate \u03b4, CRF (Corticotropin Releasing Factor) and glucocorticoid. The IC<sub>50</sub> values determined for MCI-225, for these additional receptors were all greater than 1 \u03bcmol/L. \n\n In one embodiment, the nausea, vomiting, retching or any combination thereof can be caused by anesthetics, radiation, cancer chemotherapeutic agents, toxic agents, odors, medicines, pregnancy and motion.</p>In a particular embodiment, the nausea, vomiting, retching or any combination thereof can be caused by administration of general anesthetics associated with surgical procedures.</p>In a more particular embodiment, the nausea, vomiting, retching or any combination thereof can be caused by administration of chemotherapeutic agents, radiation therapy or a combination thereof.
