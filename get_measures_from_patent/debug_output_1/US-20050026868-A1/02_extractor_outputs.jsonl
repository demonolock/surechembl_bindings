{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\nCompounds of this invention which were tested for inhibitory activity on the proliferation of HT1080 cells yielded IC25 values of 20 nM, retaining still significant activity of the parent molecule, rapamycin (IC25=0.1 nM), and exhibiting far greater potency than that seen with the bisphosphonates Zolendronate and Alendronate on osteosarcoma cells (IC50 values of 7-75 \u03bcM).\nOne of the compounds was tested for FKBP-binding and was found to have an IC50 of 5 nM in a conventional FKBP-binding assay, only slightly off rapamycin's 1 nM IC50.\nCompounds of this invention which were tested for inhibitory activity on the formation of osteoclasts provided IC50 values of 10-100 nM, retaining significant activity of the parent molecule, rapamycin (IC50=1-10 nM), and exhibiting far greater potency than that seen with Zolendronate and Alendronate (IC50=1-10 \u03bcM).\nA second compound of this series, also produced per the foregoing examples, was found to have very favorable FKBP-binding activity (IC50=3 nM) and demonstrated extremely potent activity in our mouse hypercalcimia assay, with inhibition equal to or greater than equivalent (molar) doses of rapamycin (as low as 0.3 mg/kg, daily IP)."}
