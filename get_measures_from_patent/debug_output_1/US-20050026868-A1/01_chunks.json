    "BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  Cancers of the bone, both primary bone cancers and those that have metastasized to bone (bone metastases), involve complex molecular processes and have been difficult to treat. Bone metastases, a frequent consequence of common malignancies such as breast, lung and prostate cancer, are often associated with severe bone pain and pathological fractures due to increased bone fragility. Primary bone cancers (e.g., osteogenic sarcoma) present treatment challenges, and patients often require limb amputation and/or radiation therapy. In the bone microenvironment, as it is currently understood, metastasized cancer cells produce activating factors (e.g., PTHrP) that stimulate osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Bone-derived growth factors (e.g., TGF-\u03b2 and IGF1) are subsequently released, promoting cancer-cell proliferation and the amplification of a cycle that produces net osteolytic (bone destructive) consequences. </p> The development of new therapeutic agents for treating cancers of the bone, preferably agents that act directly and potently to inhibit bone breakdown and tumor growth would be highly desirable. </p> Rapamycin is a macrolide antibiotic produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus. It binds to a FK506-binding protein, FKBP12, with high affinity to form a rapamycin:FKBP complex. Reported Kd values for that interaction are as low as 200 pM. The rapamycin:FKBP complex binds with high affinity to the large cellular protein, FRAP, to form a tripartite, [FKBP:rapamycin]:[FRAP], complex. In that complex rapamycin can be viewed as a dimerizer or adapter to join FKBP to FRAP. Formation of the complex is associated with rapamycin's various biological activities. </p> Rapamycin is a potent immunosuppressive agent and is used clinically to prevent rejection of transplanted organs. Rapamycin and/or its analogs, AP23573 (ARIAD), CCI 779 (Wyeth) and SDZ Rad (\u201cRAD001\u201d, Novartis) are promising agents for treating certain cancers, for immune suppression and/or for helping to decrease the incidence of restenosis following interventional cardiology. Rapamycin has also been shown to have activity as an antifungal agent, in the experimental allergic encephalomyelitis model (a model for multiple sclerosis), in the adjuvant arthritis model (for rheumatoid arthritis), in inhibiting the formation of IgE-like antibodies, and for treating or preventing lupus erythematosus, pulmonary inflammation, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, and smooth muscle cell proliferation and intimal thickening following vascular injury. See e.g. published U.S. patent application Ser. No. 2001/0010920. </p> Rapamycin's potential for providing relief from such an important swath of cruel diseases has stimulated the search for rapamycin analogs with improved therapeutic index",
    "transgenic mice such as oncogene containing mice may be used in the present assays (see for example U.S. Pat. No. 4,736,866 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,175,383). For a review and discussion on the use of rodent models for antitumor drug testing see Kerbel (Cancer Metastasis Rev. 17:301-304, 1998-99). </p> In general, the tumors of interest are implanted in a test organism preferably subcutaneously. The organism containing the tumor is treated with doses of candidate anti-tumor compounds. The size of the tumor is periodically measured to determine the effects of the test compound on the tumor. Some tumor types are implanted at sites other than subcutaneous sites (e.g. intraperitoneal sites) and survival is measured as the endpoint. Parameters to be assayed with routine screening include different tumor models, various tumor and drug routes, and dose amounts and schedule. For a review of the use of mice in detecting antitumor compounds see Corbett et al. (Invest New Drugs. 15:207-218, 1997; incorporated herein by reference) </p>Example 9 Biological Activity  A. Inhibition of Proliferation of HT1080 Human Fibrosarcoma Cells; FKBP-Binding </p> Compounds of this invention which were tested for inhibitory activity on the proliferation of HT1080 cells yielded IC25 values of 20 nM, retaining still significant activity of the parent molecule, rapamycin (IC25=0.1 nM), and exhibiting far greater potency than that seen with the bisphosphonates Zolendronate and Alendronate on osteosarcoma cells (IC50 values of 7-75 \u03bcM). One of the compounds was tested for FKBP-binding and was found to have an IC50 of 5 nM in a conventional FKBP-binding assay, only slightly off rapamycin's 1 nM IC50. </p> B. Inhibition of Osteoclasts Formation (Non-Bone) </p> Compounds of this invention which were tested for inhibitory activity on the formation of osteoclasts provided IC50 values of 10-100 nM, retaining significant activity of the parent molecule, rapamycin (IC50=1-10 nM), and exhibiting far greater potency than that seen with Zolendronate and Alendronate (IC50=1-10 \u03bcM). </p> C. Demonstration of Antiresorptive Activity in Hypercalcemic Mice </p> Compounds of this invention which were tested for inhibition of PTH-induced hypercalcemia in a 5-day mouse study demonstrated activity as good as or better than rapamycin in initial studies. One of the compounds demonstrated significant and sustained reduction (\u02dc70%) of serum calcium levels when dosed at 10 mg/kg (bid, IP). It also demonstrated similar inhibition with a single oral dose of 50 mg/kg (IP). </p> In a separate experiment in PTH-induced hypercalcemic mice, the compound demonstrated superior reduction (83%, Day 5) of serum calcium levels when dosed at 10 mg/kg (bid, IP) compared to rapamycin dosed similarly (38% inhibition, Day 5). </p> In that study, mice were administered test compounds or vehicle twice daily by the intraperitoneal route of administration for five consecutive days. Baseline serum calcium was measured on Day 2. Parathyroid hormone was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 20 \u03bcg/kg, four times a day, on Days 3, 4, and 5 to drug treatment and vehicle control groups. Serum calcium levels were measured on Days 4 and 5. </p> A second compound of this series, also produced per the foregoing examples, was found to have very favorable FKBP-binding activity (IC50=3 nM) and demonstrated extremely potent activity in our mouse hypercalcimia assay, with inhibition equal to or greater than equivalent (molar) doses of rapamycin (as low as 0.3 mg/kg, daily IP). </p> These results demonstrate the achievement of dual in vitro antiproliferative and antiresorptive effects with compounds of this invention containing aliphatic and aromatic groups Q. Both types of compounds demonstrated potent and sustained inhibition of PTH-induced hypercalcemia in mice. </p>"
