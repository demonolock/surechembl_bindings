    " in sequence, post-translational modifications and/or functional properties (i.e., altered characteristics) when compared to the wild-type gene or gene product. It is noted that naturally occurring mutants can be isolated; these are identified by the fact that they have altered characteristics when compared to the wild-type gene or gene product. Alternatively, a variant may also include synthetic molecules, e.g., a chemokine ligand variant may be similar in structure and/or function to the natural chemokine, but may concern a small molecule, or a synthetic peptide or protein, which is man-made. Said variants with different functional properties may concerns super-agonists, super antagonists, among other functional differences, as known to the skilled person. </p>In the context of the present technology, the terms \"specificity\", \"binding specifically\" or \"specific binding\" refer to the number of different target molecules, such as antigens, to which a particular binding unit can bind with sufficiently high affinity (see below). \n\n\"Specificity\u201d, \"binding specifically\u201d or \"specific binding\u201d are used interchangeably herein with \"selectivity\u201d, \"binding selectively\u201d or \"selective binding\u201d. Generally, binding units, such as binding ISVDs, specifically bind to their designated targets. </p>The specificity /selectivity of a binding unit can be determined based on affinity. The affinity denotes the strength or stability of a molecular interaction. The affinity is commonly given by the KD, or dissociation constant, which has units of mol/litre (or M). The affinity can also be expressed as an association constant, KA, which equals 1/KD and has units of (mol/ litre) <sup>1</sup> (or M <sup>1</sup>). </p>The affinity is a measure for the binding strength between a moiety and a binding site on a target molecule: the lower the value of the KD, the stronger the binding strength between a target molecule and a targeting moiety. </p>The Ko-value characterizes the strength of a molecular interaction also in a thermodynamic sense as it is related to the change of free energy (DG) of binding by the well-known relation DG=RT.In(Ko) (equivalently DG=-RT.In(KA)), where R equals the gas constant, T equals the absolute temperature and In denotes the natural logarithm. </p>The KD may also be expressed as the ratio of the dissociation rate constant of a complex, denoted as k<sub>O</sub>ff, to the rate of its association, denoted k<sub>on</sub> (so that KD =k<sub>O</sub>ff/k<sub>O</sub>n and K = k<sub>on</sub>/k<sub>o</sub>ff). The off-rate k<sub>O</sub>ff has units s <sup>1</sup> (where s is the SI unit notation of second). The on-rate k<sub>on</sub> has units M <sup>-1</sup>s <sup>-1</sup>. The on-rate may vary between 10<sup>2</sup> M <sup>-1</sup>s <sup>1</sup> to about 10<sup>7</sup> M <sup>-1</sup>s <sup>-1</sup>, approaching the diffusion-limited association rate constant for bimolecular interactions. The off-rate is related to the half-life of a given molecular interaction by the relation ti/2=l n (2)/k<sub>O</sub>ff . The off-rate may vary between IO<sup>-6</sup> s <sup>1</sup> (near irreversible complex with a ti/2 of multiple days) to I s <sup>1</sup> (ti/2=0.69 s). </p>The measured KD may correspond to the apparent KD if the measuring process somehow influences the intrinsic binding affinity of the implied molecules for example by artefacts related to the coating on the biosensor of one molecule. Also, an apparent KD may be \n\nmeasured if one molecule contains more than one recognition sites for the other molecule or molecules. In such situation the measured affinity may be affected by the avidity of the interaction by the two molecules. </p>The dissociation constant (KD) may be the actual or apparent dissociation constant, as will be clear to the skilled person. Methods for determining the KD will be clear to the skilled person, and for example include the techniques mentioned below. In this respect, it will also be clear that it may not be possible to measure dissociation constants of more than IO<sup>-4</sup> moles/litre or IO<sup>-3</sup> moles/litre (e.g., of IO<sup>-2</sup> moles/litre). Optionally, as will also be clear to the skilled person, the (actual or apparent) KD may be calculated on the basis of the (actual or apparent) association constant (KA), by means of the relationship (KD = 1/K ). K = 1/KD --&gt; KA= [AB] / [A].[B], </p>In the context of the present technology, the term \"avidity\" refers to the accumulated strength of multiple affinities of individual non-covalent binding interactions, such as between a protein receptor and its ligand, and may also be referred to as \"functional affinity\". \"Avidity\" differs from \"affinity\", which, as explained in detail above, describes the strength of a single interaction. </p>As used herein, the term \"binding site\" comprises a region of a polypeptide which is responsible for selectively binding to a target antigen of interest (e.g., aChR). Binding domains comprise at least one binding site. Exemplary binding domains include an antibody variable domain. Antibody molecules may comprise a single binding site or multiple (e.g., two, three or four) binding sites. </p>The terms \"variable region\" and \"variable domain\" are used herein interchangeable and are intended to have equivalent meaning. The term \"variable\" refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains VH and VL differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its target antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of \n\nantibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called \"hypervariable loops\" in each of the VL domain and the VH domain which form part of the antigen binding site. </p>In the context of the present technology, \"acidic p",

The dissociation constant may be the actual or apparent dissociation constant, as will be clear to the skilled person. Methods for determining the dissociation constant will be clear to the skilled person, and for example include the techniques mentioned below. In this respect, it will also be clear that it may not be possible to measure dissociation constants of more than IO<sup>-4</sup> moles/liter or 10<sup>-3</sup> moles/liter (e.g., of 10<sup>-2</sup> moles/liter). Optionally, as will also be clear to the skilled person, the (actual or apparent) dissociation constant may be calculated on the basis of the (actual or apparent) association constant (K ), by means of the relationship [KD = 1/K ]. The affinity of a molecular interaction between two molecules can be measured via different techniques known per se, such as the well-known surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor technique (see for example Ober et al., 2001, \n\nIntern. Immunology 13: 30 1551-1559). The term \"surface plasmon resonance\" (SPR), as used herein, refers to an optical phenomenon that allows for the analysis of real-time biospecific interactions by detection of alterations in protein concentrations within a biosensor matrix, where one molecule is immobilized on the biosensor chip and the other molecule is passed over the immobilized molecule under flow conditions yielding k<sub>on</sub>, k<sub>O</sub>ff measurements and hence KD (or K ) values. This can for example be performed using the well-known BIAcore\u00ae system (BIAcore International AB, a GE Healthcare company, Uppsala, Sweden and Piscataway, NJ) or the ProteOn\u2122 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc) system. For further descriptions, see Jonsson et al. (1993, Ann. Biol. Clin. 51: 19-26), Jonsson et al. (1991 Biotechniques 11: 620- 627), Johnsson et al. (1995, J. Mol. Recognit. 8: 125- 131), and Johnnson et al. (1991, Anal. Biochem. 198: 268-277). Another well-known biosensor technique to determine affinities of biomolecular interactions is bio-layer interferometry (BLI) (see for example Abdiche et al., 2008, Anal. Biochem. 377: 209-217). The term \"bio-layer Interferometry\" or \"BLI\", as used herein, refers to a label-free optical technique that analyzes the interference pattern of light reflected from two surfaces: an internal reference layer (reference beam) and a layer of immobilized protein on the biosensor tip (signal beam). A change in the number of molecules bound to the tip of the biosensor causes a shift in the interference pattern, reported as a wavelength shift (nm), the magnitude of which is a direct measure of the number of molecules bound to the biosensor tip surface. Since the interactions can be measured in real-time, association and dissociation rates and affinities can be determined. BLI can for example be performed using the well-known Octet\u00ae Systems (ForteBio, a division of Pall Life Sciences, Menlo Park, USA). Alternatively, affinities can be measured in Kinetic Exclusion Assay (KinExA) (see for example Drake et al. 2004, Anal. Biochem., 328: 35-43), using the KinExA\u00ae platform (Sapidyne Instruments Inc, Boise, USA). The term \"KinExA\", as used herein, refers to a solution-based method to measure true equilibrium binding affinity and kinetics of unmodified molecules. Equilibrated solutions of an antibody/antigen complex are passed over a column with beads precoated with antigen (or antibody), allowing the free antibody (or antigen) to bind to the coated molecule. Detection of the antibody (or antigen) thus captured is accomplished with a fluorescently labelled protein binding the antibody (or antigen). The GYROLAB\u00ae immunoassay system provides a platform for automated bioanalysis and rapid sample turnaround (Fraley et al., 2013, Bioanalysis 5: 1765-74). \n\nTypically, binding units (such as ISVDs, HSA, DARPins, Affitins or ABDs, as described herein), or polypeptides or fusion proteins of the present technology will bind to their targets with a dissociation constant (KD) of IO<sup>-5</sup> to 10 <sup>12</sup> moles/liter or less, and preferably 10<sup>-7</sup> to 10\u2019 <sup>12</sup> moles/liter or less and more preferably IO<sup>-8</sup> to 10<sup>12</sup> moles/liter (i.e., with an association constant (KA) of 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>12</sup> liter/moles or more, and preferably 10<sup>7</sup> to 10<sup>12</sup> liter/moles or more and more preferably 10<sup>8</sup> to 10<sup>12</sup> liter/moles). Any KD value greater than IO<sup>-4</sup> mol/liter (or any K value lower than 10<sup>4</sup> liters/mol) is generally considered to indicate non-specific binding. The KD for biological interactions, such as the binding of immunoglobulin sequences to an antigen, which are considered specific are typically in the range of IO<sup>-5</sup> moles/liter (10000 nM or 10 pM) to 10<sup>12</sup> moles/liter (0.001 nM or 1 pM) or less. Accordingly, specific/selective binding may mean that - using the same measurement method, e.g., SPR - a binding unit (or polypeptide comprising the same) binds to their targets with a KD value of 10<sup>-5</sup> to 10\u2019 <sup>12</sup> moles/liter or less and binds to related targets with a KD value greater than IO<sup>-4</sup> moles/liter. </p>In particular embodiments, the binding units (such as ISVDs, HSA, DARPins, Affitins or ABDs, as described herein), or polypeptides or fusion proteins of the present technology comprise at least one domain that specifically binds to a serum albumin protein, such as to HSA, with an affinity (KA) of between 10<sup>5</sup> M <sup>1</sup> and 10<sup>11</sup> M <sup>-1</sup>, such as between 10<sup>6</sup> M <sup>1</sup> and 10<sup>11</sup> M <sup>1</sup>. </p>In particular embodiments, the polypeptides and/or fusion proteins comprise at least one domain specifically binding to a serum albumin protein (such as an ISVDs, a HSA, a DARPin, an Affitin or an ABD, as described herein) with a dissociation constant (KD) of between 10<sup>-6</sup> M and 8.5*10<sup>11</sup> M or less, such as of between 10<sup>-6</sup> M and 10 <sup>11</sup> M or less. Preferably, the KD is determined by Kinexa, BLI or SPR, for instance as determined by SPR. </p>In particular embodiments, the binding units (such as ISVDs, HSA, DARPins, Affitins or ABDs, as described herein), or polypeptides or fusion proteins of the present technology comprise are generally preferably such that they bind to human serum albumin with a dissociation constant (KD) of 10<sup>-5</sup> to 10<sup>12</sup> moles/liter or less, and preferably 10<sup>-7</sup> to 10<sup>12</sup> moles/liter or less and more preferably IO<sup>-8</sup> to 10<sup>12</sup> moles/liter, and/or with a binding affinity of at least 10<sup>7</sup> M\" \n\n<sup>1</sup>, preferably at least 10<sup>8</sup> M <sup>-1</sup>, more preferably at least 10<sup>9</sup> M-l, such as at least IO<sup>12</sup> M <sup>-1</sup>, as determined using ProteOn. Preferably, a serum albumin binder of the technology (such as ISVDs, HSA, DARPins, Affitins or ABDs, as described herein) will bind to the desired antigen with an affinity less than 500 nM, preferably less than 200 nM, more preferably less than 10 nM, such as less than 500 pM, as determined using ProteOn. </p>In particular embodiments, the polypeptides and/or fusion proteins of the technology comprise at least one domain specifically binding to a serum albumin protein (such as ISVDs, HSA, DARPins, Affitins or ABDs, as described herein) with an on-rate constant (k<sub>on</sub>) selected from the group consisting of at least about 10<sup>2</sup> M <sup>-1</sup>s <sup>-1</sup>, of at least about 10<sup>3</sup> M <sup>-1</sup>s <sup>-1</sup>, at least about 10<sup>4</sup> M ^s <sup>1</sup>, at least about 10<sup>5</sup> M ^s <sup>1</sup>, at least about 10<sup>6</sup> M ^s <sup>1</sup>, at least about 10<sup>7</sup> M ^s <sup>1</sup>, and at least about 10<sup>8</sup> M <sup>-1</sup>s <sup>-1</sup>, preferably as measured by surface p",

In particular, the serum albumin binders (binding units such as ISVDs, HSA, DARPins, Affitins or ABDs, as described herein, polypeptides and/or fusion proteins) according to the different aspects of the present technology may be such that they are (at least) cross-reactive between human serum albumin and at least one, preferably at least two, more preferably at all three of rat serum albumin, mouse serum albumin and serum albumin from cynomolgus monkey. In this respect, the serum albumin \n\nbinders of the technology may have improved cross-reactivity (in particular between human serum albumin on the one hand and rat and/or mouse serum albumin on the other hand) compared to serum albumin binders that have (essentially) the same CDR's (according to AbM numbering) as Alb-11 and/or Alb23002(ElD), see, e.g., SEQ ID NO.: 9 (Alb-11) or SEQ ID NO.: 19 (Alb23002(ElD)). </p>When a binding unit (such as ISVDs, HSA, DARPins, Affitins or ABDs, as described herein) or a polypeptide, or a fusion protein of the present technology is said to exhibit \"(improved) crossreactivity for binding to human and non-human primate serum albumin\" compared to another binding unit (such as ISVDs, HSA, DARPins, Affitins or ABDs, as described herein) or polypeptide, orfusion protein, it means that forsaid binding unit (such as ISVDs, HSA, DARPins, Affitins or ABDs, as described herein) or polypeptide, orfusion protein, the ratio of the binding activity (such as expressed in terms of KD or k<sub>O</sub>ff) for human serum albumin and for non-human primate serum albumin is lower than that same ratio calculated for the other binding unit (such as ISVDs, HSA, DARPins, Affitins or ABDs, as described herein) or polypeptide, or fusion protein in the same assay. Good cross-reactivity for binding to human and non-human primate serum albumin allows for the assessment of toxicity of a serum albumin binding polypeptide according to the present technology in preclinical studies conducted on non-human primates. </p>In particular embodiments, the at least one serum albumin binding domain comprised in the polypeptides of the technology is such that it is (at least) cross-reactive between human serum albumin and cynomolgus monkey serum albumin, and preferably also between either human serum albumin and/or cynomolgus monkey serum albumin on the one hand, and at least one, preferably both of rat serum albumin and pig serum albumin on the other hand. For the sake of convenience, in the sequence of serum albumin, the stretches of amino acids that are assumed to be part of the putative epitope of the polypeptides of the technology have been highlighted. Without being limited to any specific mechanism or hypothesis, it is assumed that the polypeptides and fusion proteins of the technology are (essentially) capable of binding to (one or more amino acid residues within) the corresponding stretches of amino acid residues that are present within the amino acid sequence of those ma",

HSA or MSA (HSA: Sigma-Aldrich - Sigma, Cat No. A8763; MSA: Albumin Bioscience, Cat No. 2601) was immobilized via amine coupling on a GLC sensor (short matrix, normal capacity). The constructs were injected at 6 different concentrations (between 0,95 and 500 nM) and allowed to associate for 120 s at 45 pL/min and dissociate for 600 s. Evaluation of the sensorgrams was based on the Kinetic Langmuir 1:1 (simultaneous ka/kd) fit.

The binding levels of HSA were significantly higher on the constructs containing multiple albumin binding building blocks compared to the control. We estimated the amount of HSA molecules bound to the ISVD-comprising constructs, based on the ratio of the capture level to the binding level and the molecular weight of both the construct and HSA. When determining the theoretical number of HSA molecules bound, the number increased with increasing HSA concentrations until saturation, and all constructs with more than one albumin binding building block could bind also more than one HSA molecule.

BALB/c mice (n=3) were injected with 5 mg/kg of T032200003 (189 nmol/kg) and serum samples were obtained at 0.083, 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 24, 48, 96 and 168h. Serum samples were analyzed by ligand-binding assay. </p>A second set of pharmacokinetic experiments was performed in BALB/c mice to evaluate halflife of a broad set of multivalent serum albumin binding-comprising constructs. Mice (n=3/group) were injected intravenously in the tail vein with an equimolar dose (approximately 189 nmol/kg) of the constructs as listed in Table 15. Plasma samples were obtained via serial (~10uL) at 0.25, 1, 4, 8, 24, 48, 72, 168, 336 and 504h. </p>Plasma samples were analyzed by LC-MS2 for the presence of multivalent ISVD-comprising constructs as described in Example 3. All in vivo studies were conducted in compliance with the Sanofi institutional animal care policy. </p>PK parameters for all constructs were obtained from non-compartmental analysis (NCA) in Phoenix WinNonlin\u00ae (version 8.2.2.227.
