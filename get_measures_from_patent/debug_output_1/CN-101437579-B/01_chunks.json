    " test confirms.2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl is a free radical stable in solution.This unpaired electron causes the strong absorption band at the 515nm place, and this solution has mulberry.In the presence of free radical scavenger, this electronics is paired, and this absorbs disappearance, and considers the electronics that is absorbed, and decolouring is undertaken by stoichiometry.Absorbance is used photometric determination.The free radical resisting performance of the material of testing is employed 2 through measuring, and the concentration when 50% of 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl has reacted with free radical scavenger is confirmed.This concentration is used EC\n        \n        <sub>50</sub>Represent that this value should be regarded as the performance of this material under given measuring condition.Material of being studied and standard substance (for example tocopherol) are relatively.Here EC\n        \n        <sub>50</sub>Value is measuring of each chemical compound ability of removing free radical.EC\n        \n        <sub>50</sub>Be worth lowly more, the ability of removing free radical is high more.For the present invention, if EC\n        \n        <sub>50</sub>Value is lower than the value of tocopherol, uses statement \" ability of removing free radical is big or high \" so.\n      \n      </p>The important aspect of another of antioxidant action is to reach this EC\n        \n        <sub>50</sub>The time of value.This time of Minute provides T\n        \n        <sub>EC50</sub>Value, this feasible conclusion that can draw the speed of these antioxidant for clearing free radicals.For the present invention, be considered to fast being less than the antioxidant that reaches this value in 60 minutes, after surpassing 120 minutes, just reach this EC\n        \n        <sub>50</sub>Those antioxidants of value are considered to have delay action.\n      \n      </p>Free radical resisting efficient (AE) (C.Sanchez-Moreno, J.A.Larrauri and F.Saura-Calixto be at J.Sci.Food Agric.1998, and 76 (2), described in the 270-276) provide through above-mentioned amount according to following relational expression:</p>AE=1EC50TEC50</p>Low AE (* 10\n        \n        <sup>3</sup>) be that medium AE is in 10 to 20 scope in about 10 scope at the most, and according to the present invention, high AE has and is higher than 20 value.\n      \n      </p>Here especially preferably the fastoperation antioxidant is combined with those antioxidants with slow or time-lag action.The typical weight of fastoperation antioxidant and time-delay antioxidant than at 10:1 to 1:10, preferred 10:1 is to the scope of 1:1, and for skin protection composition, especially preferably arrives the scope of 2:1 at 5:1.In other same preferred other compositions, yet, for optimization function, can be advantageously, the amount of time-delay antioxidant is more than the fastoperation antioxidant.Exemplary composition has 1:1 so to 1:10, and preferred 1:2 is to the weight ratio of fastoperation ant",
