    "s were infected with vaccinia virus at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 1 pfu/cell. Culture supernatants were harvested at 24 hours post infection hpi and tested for expression of INF-\u03b3 receptors using a cross-linking assay. Media from uninfected or infected cultures (24hpi) were incubated with 1.7nM <sup>125</sup>I-INF- \u03b3, in the absence or presence of 100-fold excess IL-1 \u03b2 or IFN-\u03b3. IFN-g receptor complexes were cross-linked by the addition of EDC and samples were analysed by SDS- PAGE in 12% polyacrylamide gels and autoradiography (Figure 25). The effect of TMPEG and MPEG treatment on expression of the INF-\u03b3 receptor is shown in Figure 25, using the doses of medium (\u03bcl) indicated, from uninfected or infected cultures at 24 hpi. No variation in expression was detected. No IFN-\u03b3 binding activity was detected in medium harvested after the absorption period (data not shown). Recombinant baculovirus-infected cells expressing the vaccinia IL-1 \u03b2 receptor or the vaccinia INF-\u03b3 receptor were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. The specificity of the <sup>125</sup>I-IFN-\u03b3 binding was confirmed by competition with unlabelled IFN-\u03b3, but not unlabelled IL-l\u03b2. \n\n Expression of the soluble interleukin-l\u03b2 receptor, expressed from a late promoter, was assayed as follows. TK<sup>\"</sup>143B cell monolayers were infected with vaccinia virus at an moi of 1 pfu/cell. Culture supematants were harvested at 24 hpi and tested for expression of IL-1 \u03b2 receptors in a soluble binding assay. Media from uninfected and infected cultures (24 hpi) were incubated with 140pM <sup>125</sup>I-IL-l\u03b2, in the presence or absence of 100 fold excess IL-l\u03b2 or IFN-\u03b3. Bound IL-\u03b2 was determined by precipitation with polyethylene glycol and the precipitate collected on Whatman GF/C filters. Background radioactivity precipitated in the presence of binding medium was subtracted. One \u03bcl of medium was equivalent to 1500 cells. Specific bound radioactivity (\u00b1 standard deviation) is shown in Figure 26. At the indicated doses (\u03bcl), media assayed from cells infected with 20%oMPEG and 20% TMPEG treated virus, showed little or no difference in activity. Binding activity of medium harvested after the absorption period is given as t = 0. Supematants from recombinant baculovirus infected cells, expressing vaccinia IL-lb or vaccinia IFN-g were used as positive and negative controls respectively. Figure 27 shows the impact of incubation with TMPEG<sub>5000</sub> or MPEG<sub>5000</sub> on neutralisation of the virus by anti vaccinia serum. Wtih the MPEG treated virus, all dilutions of serum produced a similar reduction in pfu ml, indicative of neutralisation. A protective effect was evident in the TMPEG treated samples at 1/1000, 1/500 and possibly 1/250 dilutions of serum.</p>\n  Example 18</p>\n  Covalent attachment of Polyethylene Glycol to Retrovirus</p>\n  As a representitive example of retrovirus vectors, the mammalian C-type retrovirus, Molony murine leukaemia virus (MMLV) was "
