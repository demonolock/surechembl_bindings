    "\n Antibiotic-Antimycotic PLUS: 1 uM IBMX (3-Isobutyl-l-methylxanthine) Inhibitor of phosphodiesterases, 1 uM Dexamethasone, 1 uM Rosiglitazone, 10 ug/ml Insulin). The cells were incubated in said medium for 3 days and then medium was changed to post- differentiation medium (DMEM / 10% FBS PLUS: 10 ug/ ml Insulin) and the cells were incubated for an additional 3 days. The medium was then changed to maintenance media (DMEM / 10% FBS). The cells were fed every 3 days with maintenance media until use. The lipolysis assay may be performed on day 9-14 after the initiation of differentiation in 96 well plates. </p>The lipolysis assay was performed as follows. The adipocytes were washed 2x with 200ul Krebs Ringer Bicarbonate Hepes buffer (KRBH) / 3% BSA. Test compounds were at lOmM in DMSO and were initially diluted to 5 mM in DMSO. They were then serially diluted 5-fold in DMSO (5 mM to 320 pM). Each compound was then diluted 200-fold into KRBH / 3% BSA (0.5% DMSO final). The resulting solutions range from 25 uM to 1.6 pM final. One hundred fifty ul of the diluted compounds were added to each well (in triplicate) and the cells were preincubated 30 min at 37\u00b0 C. Forskolin (50 uM final) was added to the wells and the cells were incubated 120 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. One hundred ul was collected into a new 96- well plate for glycerol analysis. The amount of glycerol produced was determined using a glycerol determination kit (Sigma). </p>HSL hum HSL hum HSL hum</p>Example Example Example </p> IC50 (uM) IC50 (uM) IC50 (uM) </p>1 0.17 7 0.311 13 0.174 </p>2 0.0495 8 0.259 14 0.845 </p>3 0.354 9 0.438 15 0.727 </p>4 0.71 10 0.956 16 0.953 </p>5 0.136 11 0.0501 17 0.0512 </p>6 0.359 12 0.38 18 0.244 \n\n HSL hum HSL hum HSL hum</p>Example Example Example </p> IC50 (uM) IC50 (uM) IC50 (uM) </p>19 0.867 26 0.033 33 0.0965 </p>20 0.268 27 0.7 34 0.482 </p>21 0.327 28 0.896 35 0.554 </p>22 0.701 29 0.637 36 0.139 </p>23 0.161 30 0.502 </p>24 0.153 31 0.443 </p>25 0.334 32 0.279 </p>Compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts or esters thereof as described above have IC<sub>50</sub> values between 0.0001 uM and 1000 uM, particular compounds have IC<sub>50</sub> values between 0.001 uM and 500 uM, further particular compounds have IC<sub>50</sub> values between 0.001 uM and 5 uM. These results have been obtained by using the foregoing HSL enzyme inhibition assay (uM means microMolar). The compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be used as medicaments (e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations). The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered internally, such as orally (e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatin capsules, solutions, emulsions or </p>suspensions), nasally (e.g. in the form of nasal sprays) or rectally (e.g. in the form of suppositories). However, the administration can also be effected parentally, such as intramuscularly or intravenously (e.g. in the form of injection solutions). </p>The compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic adjuvants for the production of tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatin capsules.
