    "n antibody. These antibody fragments are obtained using conventional techniques known to those of skill in the art, and the fragments are screened for utility in the same manner as are intact antibodies.</p>Antigen binding fragments can also be incorporated into single domain antibodies, maxibodies, minibodies, intrabodies, diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies, v-NAR and bis-scFv (see, e.g., Hollinger and Hudson, 2005, Nature Biotechnology, 23, 9, 1126-1136). Antigen binding portions of antibodies can be grafted into scaffolds based on polypeptides such as Fibronectin type III (Fn3) (see U.S. Pat. No. 6,703,199, which describes fibronectin polypeptide monobodies).</p>Antigen binding fragments can be incorporated into single chain molecules comprising a pair of tandem Fv segments (VH-CH1-VH-CH1) which, together with complementary light chain polypeptides, form a pair of antigen binding regions (Zapata et al., 1995 Protein Eng. 8(10):1057-1062; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,870).</p>As used herein, the term \u201caffinity\u201d refers to the strength of interaction between antibody and antigen at single antigenic sites. Within each antigenic site, the variable region of the antibody \u201carm\u201d interacts through weak non-covalent forces with antigen at numerous sites; the more interactions, the stronger the affinity. As used herein, the term \u201chigh affinity\u201d for an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof (e.g.: a Fab fragment) generally refers to an antibody, or antigen binding fragment, having a KD of 10<sup>\u22129</sup>M or less.</p>The term \u201camino acid\u201d refers to naturally occurring and synthetic amino acids, as well as amino acid analogs and amino acid mimetics that function in a manner similar to the naturally occurring amino acids. Naturally occurring amino acids are those encoded by the genetic code, as well as those amino acids that are later modified, e.g., hydroxyproline, \u03b3-carboxyglutamate, and O-phosphoserine. Amino acid analogs refer to compounds that have the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid, i.e., an alpha carbon that is bound to a hydrogen, a carboxyl group, an amino group, and an R group, e.g., homoserine, norleucine, methionine sulfoxide, methionine methyl sulfonium. Such analogs have modified R groups (e.g., norleucine) or modified peptide backbones, but retain the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid. Amino acid mimetics refers to chemical compounds that have a structure that is different from the general chemical structure of an amino acid, but that functions in a manner similar to a naturally occurring amino acid.</p>The term \u201cbinding specificity\u201d as used herein refers to the ability of an individual antibody combining site to react with only one antigenic determinant.</p>The phrase \u201cspecifically (or selectively) binds\u201d to an antibody (e.g., an Epo-binding antibody) refers to a binding reaction that is determinative of the presence of a cognate antigen (e.g., a human Epo or cynomolgus Epo)",
    "ition or disorder associated with retinal vascular disease as described below.</p>As used herein, \u201cinhibit (or inhibits) Epo dependent cell signaling\u201d refers to the ability of an anti-Epo antibody described herein to produce a statistically significant (i.e., p&lt;0.05) decrease in the activation of the intracellular signaling pathways stimulated or induced by Epo.</p>The term \u201cisolated antibody\u201d refers to an antibody that is substantially free of other antibodies having different antigenic specificities (e.g., an isolated antibody that specifically binds Epo is substantially free of antibodies that specifically bind antigens other than Epo). An isolated antibody that specifically binds Epo may, however, have cross-reactivity to other antigens. Moreover, an isolated antibody may be substantially free of other cellular material and/or chemicals.</p>The term \u201cisotype\u201d refers to the antibody class (e.g., IgM, IgE, IgG such as IgG1 or IgG4) that is provided by the heavy chain constant region genes. Isotype also includes modified versions of one of these classes, where modifications have been made to alter the Fc function, for example, to enhance or reduce effector functions or binding to Fc receptors. Isotype also refers to the antibody class (e.g., kappa, lambda) that is provided by the light-chain constant regions.</p>The term \u201cKassoc\u201d or \u201cKa\u201d, as used herein, is intended to refer to the association rate of a particular antibody-antigen interaction, whereas the term \u201cKdis\u201d or \u201cKd,\u201d as used herein, is intended to refer to the dissociation rate of a particular antibody-antigen interaction. The term \u201cK<sub>D</sub>\u201d, as used herein, is intended to refer to the dissociation constant, which is obtained from the ratio of Kd to Ka (i.e. Kd/Ka) and is expressed as a molar concentration (M). K<sub>D </sub>values for antibodies can be determined using methods well established in the art. Methods for determining the K<sub>D </sub>of an antibody include measuring surface plasmon resonance using a biosensor system such as a Biacore\u00ae system, or measuring affinity in solution by solution equilibrium titration (SET).</p>The terms \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d or \u201cmonoclonal antibody composition\u201d as used herein refer to a preparation of antibody molecules of single molecular composition. A monoclonal antibody composition displays a single binding specificity and affinity for a particular epitope.</p>The term \u201cnucleic acid\u201d is used herein interchangeably with the term \u201cpolynucleotide\u201d and refers to deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides and polymers thereof in either single- or double-stranded form. The term encompasses nucleic acids containing known nucleotide analogs or modified backbone residues or linkages, which are synthetic, naturally occurring, and non-naturally occurring, which have similar binding properties as the reference nucleic acid, and which are metabolized in a manner similar to the reference nucleotides. Examples of such analogs include, without limitation, phosphorothioates, phosphoramidates, methyl phosphonates, chiral-methyl phosphonates, 2-O-methyl ribonucleotides, peptide-nucleic acids (PNAs).</p>Unless otherwise indicated, a particular nucleic acid sequence also implicitly encompasses conservatively m",

Positive binding to the synthetic peptides indicated that residues contained in that domain of Epo were involved in binding to the anti-Epo antibody. For the truncated proteins, loss of binding indicated the involvement of the truncated portion in binding to the anti-Epo antibody. However, the loss of binding did not preclude the possibility that the truncation altered the structure of the remaining protein significantly so as to affect binding to the anti-Epo antibodies. The human Epo-human TPO chimeras enabled maintenance of structure while still allowing epitope mapping. Loss of binding to a variant that contained a portion of hTPO indicated that the homologous region in hEpo was important for binding to the anti-Epo antibody.</p>Peptide Epitope Mapping of Anti-Erythropoietin AntibodiesThe following six peptides (Table 6), corresponding to the helices of erythropoietin were synthesized.</p>T"
