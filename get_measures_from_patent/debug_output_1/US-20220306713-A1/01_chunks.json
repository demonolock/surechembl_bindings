    "d methods are not intended to limit the invention, but merely to illustrate specific embodiments falling within the scope of the invention. One skilled in the art may develop equivalent compositions, materials, and methods without the exercise of inventive capacity and without departing from the scope of the invention. It will be understood that many variations can be made in the procedures herein described while still remaining within the bounds of the present invention. It is the intention of the inventors that such variations are included within the scope of the invention.</p>Example 1This example shows the generation of antibody-IL-10 fusion proteins and the test of their functions in vitro.</p>A list of antibody-IL-10 fusion proteins were designed based on anti-human PD-1 7A4D (see U.S. Pat. No. 10,428,146 to Qui et al) and anti-human PD-L1 antibody 5G11 (see U.S. Pat. No. 10,435,470 to Zha et al), respectively. The antibody-IL-10 fusion proteins were expressed in CHO cells through transient transfections, and affinity purified. The IL-10 moiety was linked to the C-terminus of either the heavy or light chain of the corresponding antibody via a linker of (GGGGSGGGGS (SEQ ID NO:15)). As shown in Table 1, the expression yield of each antibody-IL-10 fusion protein was similar to that of the corresponding antibody.</p>Further, the binding kinetics and binding affinity of each antibody-IL-10 fusion protein to the corresponding target were measured by Biacore analysis. The Ka, Kd, and K<sub>D </sub>values were similar between the antibody and antibody-IL-10 fusion protein regardless of the fusion format.</p>TABLE 1Characterization of the binding kinetics of antibody-IL-10 fusion proteinsbased on anti-human PD-1 antibody7A4D and anti-human PD-L1 antibody 5G11.Binding kinetics to targetName ofTarget ofIL-10 fusionExpressionKaKdK<sub>D</sub>proteinantibodyformattiter (mg/L)(1/Ms)(1/s)(nM)chi<sup>2</sup>7A4DPD-1N/A259.74E+058.06E\u2212040.830.2347A4D-HC-PD-1Heavy chain148.78E+058.18E\u2212040.930.442rhIL10C-terminal7A4D-LC-PD-1Light chain559.44E+058.23E\u2212040.870.301rhIL10C-terminal5G11PD-L1N/A232.65E+067.79E\u2212040.290.4075G11-HC-PD-L1Heavy chain232.75E+067.60E\u2212040.280.218rhIL10C-terminal5G11-LC-PD-L1Light chain292.82E+067.75E\u2212040.270.163rhIL10C-terminal</p>For Biacore analysis, anti-human IgG Fc secondary antibody was diluted with sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0 to 25 \u03bcg/mL and immobilized onto both reference and test channels on a CM5 chip using Amine Coupling Kit. Each antibody or antibody-IL-10 fusion protein was diluted with running buffer to 1-3 \u03bcg/mL and captured on different channels of the pre-immobilized CM5 chip for 60 s at a flow rate of 10 \u03bcl/min. Binding was measured by flowing the recombinant human PD-1 or PD-L1 antigen in HBS EP buffer at a concentration between 3.125 and 100 nM in 2-fold serially-dilution at a flow rate of 30 \u03bcl/min. The association time and dissociation time were set at 90 s and 400 s, respectively. The measured affinity data were fitted to 1:1 Langmuir binding model using Biacore T200 Evaluation software 3.1.</p>As shown in FIGS. 9A and 9B, both 7A4D and 5G11 antibody blocked the PD-L1-PD-1 pathway and induced IFN-gamma and IL-2 secretion of CD4<sup>+</sup> effector T cells. The antibody-IL-10 fusion proteins based on either antibody elicited the same effect with the IL-10 moiety being linked to the Ig heavy or light chain C-terminus. Each antibody and the corresponding antibody-IL-10 fusion proteins showed the dose-dependent induction of cytokine production in a similar manner, suggesting that the linking of IL-10 to the antibody has minimal effect on the function of 7A4D and 5G11 antibody.</p>The inventor further tested whether the antibody-IL-10 fusion protein retains the IL-10 activity of inducing immune cell proliferation. IL-10 administration to MC/9 cells leads to cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. On a 96-well microtitre plate, 2.5\u00d710<sup>4 </sup>MC/9 cells in 100 \u03bcl medium supplemented with recombinant Human IL-10 (rIL-10) or each antibody-IL-10 fusion protein to the designated final concentration were placed into each well. The maximum concentration of rIL-10 or fusion protein was 5,260 pmol/L. After 48 hours at 37\u00b0 C., 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, CellTiter 96\u00ae AQueous One Solution (Promega) was added to each assay well and the cell numbers were measured at absorbance at 490 nm. EC50 was calculated from the fitted curve of supplement-concentration versus OD 490 nm.</p>As shown in FIG. 10, IL-10 linked to the Ig heavy chain C-terminus of anti-PD-1 antibody 7A4D, but not light chain, induced MC/9 cell proliferation robustly, exhibiting a similar EC50 as human IL-10. Similarly, IL-10 linked to the C-terminus of heavy or light chain of the anti-PD-L1 antibody 5G11 induced MC/9 cell proliferation robustly, exhibiting a similar EC50 as human IL-10.</p>Example 2This example evaluates the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of antibody-IL-10 fusion proteins in syngeneic mouse tumor models. A fusion protein based on a rat-anti-mouse PD-L1 monoclonal antibody 10F.9G2 was designed, expressed in CHO cells through transient transfection and affinity purified. The antibody 10F.9G2 is of IgG2a, \u03ba-isotype, and the fusion protein contains a mouse IL-10 moiety fused at the C-terminus of Ig heavy chain. The expression yield of the antibody-IL-10 fusion protein in comparison with the 10F.9G2 antibody is listed in Table 2.</p>TABLE 2Expression yield of anti-mouse-PD-L1antibody-IL-10 fusion proteinCultureFinalExpressionvolumeyieldtiterProtein name(ml)(mg)(mg/L)10F.9G2 (un-conjugated)20027.26513610F.9G2-HC-mIL-1060032.8855</p>Mouse tumor cell line A20 and CT26 express PD-L1 on the surface at a very high and low level, respectively. Anti-PD-L1 (10F.9G2) antibody and anti-PD-L1(10F.9G2) antibody-HC-mIL-10 fusion protein were each labelled with PE using a R-Phycoerythrin Conjugation Kit (Abcam). Prior to staining, A20 and CT26 cells were treated with 1 \u03bcg/mL Mouse BD Fc Block (BD Biosciences) at 4\u00b0 C. for 5 min. Various amount of PE-labelled proteins as specified was used to stain treated cells in a total volume of 100 \u03bcl. Stained cells were analyzed on a LSRFortessa X-20 Flow Cytometer.</p>As shown in FIG. 11, anti-PD-L1(10F.9G2) antibody-HC-mIL-10 fusion protein showed dose-dependent staining of A20 cells, which has a high-"
