Anandamide analogs in a cyclodextrin inclusion complex have been described as being useful for treating intraocular hypertension (WO1996001558). Anandamide is understood to be a partial agonist of the CBi receptor; a weak partial agonist of the CB2 receptor, a partial agonist of vanilloid receptor VR1 (also known as transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 ; or, TrpV1 ), and an agonistic ligand of the GPR55 receptor (Reggio PH. Endocannabinoid binding to the cannabinoid receptors: what is known and what remains unknown. Curr Med Chem. 2010;17(14):1468-1486; Roberts LA, Christie MJ, Connor M. Anandamide is a partial agonist at native vanilloid receptors in acutely isolated mouse trigeminal sensory neurons. Br J Pharmacol. 2002 Oct;137(4):421 -8). The binding affinity of anandamide and analogs thereof for the CB1 and CB2 receptors have been reported, with anandamide evidencing a preferential affinity for CB1 binding, for example having a Ki for CB1 of less than 100nM and a Ki for CB2 of more than 1000nM (Lin, S., Khanolkar, A. D., Fan, P., Goutopoulos, A., Qin, C., Papahadjis, D., &amp; Makriyannis, A. (1998). Novel Analogues of Arachidonylethanolamide (Anandamide): Affinities for the CB1 and CB2 Cannabinoid Receptors and Metabolic Stability. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 41 (27), 5353-5361 ). </p><p id=\"p0013\" num=\"0013\">[0008] Nitric oxide free radicals are involved in a very wide range of physiological signalling functions, with a complex relationship understood to exist between the endocannabinoid system and nitrergic signalling (Christopher Lipina, Harinder S. Hundal, The endocannabinoid system: \u2018NO\u2019 longer anonymous in the control of nitrergic signalling?, Journal of Molecular Cell Biology, Volume 9, Issue 2, April 2017, Pages 91- 103). Nitric oxide is synthesized physiologically by a family of nitric oxide synthases that convert L-arginine to L-citrulline and nitric oxide, and L-citrulline is in turn recycled to provide L-arginine. Measurement of fractional NO concentration in exhaled breath \n<!-- EPO <DP n=\"6\"/>-->\n(FENO) has been used as a quantitative, noninvasive, method of measuring airway inflammation. Methods and devices have been described for measuring NO in body fluids, for example by measuring salivary nitric oxide analytes, including nitrite, as a precursor and biomarker for nitric oxide, for example being capable of detecting a concentration range of salivary nitric oxide analyte from 25 to &gt;400 umol/L nitrite (for exam",

Alternatively, the binding affinity of anandamide analogs for the CB1 and CB2 receptors may be characterized by a preferential affinity for CB1 binding, for example having a Ki for CB1 of less than 10OnM and a Ki for CB2 of more than 10OOnM. </p><p id=\"p0030\" num=\"0030\">[0021] The present formulations may be used so as to raise physiological NO levels, for example for treating or preventing a nitric oxide deficiency or a disease which can be treated or prevented by increasing endogenous nitric oxide levels in a mammal. It is understood that deficiencies in nitric oxide contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular system conditions, including hypertension and the cardiovascular disease (e.g. atherosclerosis, restenosis). It is understood that in female human patients, NO deficiency may be involved in pathological conditions such as preeclampsia, preterm birth, cervical incompetence, recurrent abortions, dysmenorrhea, infertility, hot flushes, cardiovascular disease, urinary incontinence and cognition problems. Similarly, particularly in aging men, NO deficiency is implicated in cardiovascular disease, hypertension, impotence and osteoporosis. Accordingly, treatments are provided herein for nitric oxide-associated disorders and diseases such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease (e.g. atherosclerosis, restenosis), osteoporosis, preeclampsia, preterm labor, dysmenorrhea, cervical dystocia, urinary incontinence, male impotence, and female infertility. </p><p id=\"p0031\" num=\"0031\">[0022] Select embodiments of the present formulations include citrulline or a citrulline analogue, such as: D, L-citrulline, L-citrulline, L-citrulline monoacetate, L- citrulline hydrochloride, L-citrull"
