    "s of thiuram disulfide compounds and heavy metal ions are known to the ordinary artisan. For example, chelates of disulfiram and copper, zinc, silver, or gold ions can be conveniently synthesized by mixing, in a suitable solvents, disulfiram with, e.g., CuS0<sub>4</sub>, ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>5</sub>Ag0<sub>3</sub>, or HAuCl<sub>4</sub>3H<sub>2</sub>O to allow chelates to be formed. Other thiuram disulfide compound- heavy metal ion chelates are disclosed in, e.g., Burns et al., Adv. Inorg. Chem. Radiochem. 23:211-280 (1980), which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>\n  In accordance with another aspect of this invention, a method for treating cancer in a patient is provided which includes administering to the patient a \n\ntherapeutically effective amount of a thiuram disulfide compound and an intracellular heavy metal ion stimulant, which can enhance the intracellular level of the above described heavy metal ions in the patient.</p>\n  Intracellular heavy metal ion carriers are known. For example, ceruloplasmin can be administered to the patient to enhance the intracellular copper level. Other heavy metal ion carriers known in the art may also be administered in accordance with this aspect of the invention. The heavy metal ion carriers and the thiuram disulfide compound can be administered together or separately, and preferably in separate compositions. Ceruloplasmin is a protein naturally produced by human body and can be purified from human serum. This 132-kD glycoprotein, which carries 7 copper atoms complexed over three 42-45 kD domains, is an acute phase reactant and the major copper-carrying protein in human plasma. See Halliwell, et al. Methods Enzymol. 186:1-85(1990). When transported into cells, at least some of the bound cupric ions can be accessible for complexation with the thiuram disulfide compound administer to the patient. Percival, et al. Am. J. Physiol. 258:3140-3146 (1990).</p>\n  Ceruloplasmin can be isolated from animal or human serum. Alternatively, genetical engineered ceruloplasmin can also be expressed in vitro in, e.g., bacteria, yeast, plant, animal or human cells and purified therefrom. Ceruloplasmin and thiuram disulfide are typically administered in different compositions. Thiuram disulfide and ceruloplasmin can be administered at about the same time, or at some time apart. For example, ceruloplasmin can be administered from about five minutes to about 12 hours before or after thiuram disulfide is administered to the patient.</p>\n  In another embodiment, instead of heavy metal ion carriers, a cytokine is administered to the patient in addition to a thiuram disulfide compound. Suitable cytokines include, e.g., interferon \u03b1, interferon \u03b2, interferon \u03b3, and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Such cytokines, when administered to a patient, are capable of inducing an acute phase response in the body of the patient thus stimulating serum ceruloplasmin in the patient. \n\n The biochemical and physiological properties of such cytokines have been studied extensively in the art and are familiar to",
    "iram with gold exhibit enhanced antiproliferative activity. All metal complexes showed increased antiproliferative activity compared to disulfiram, but the most active compound was formed by the complex of gold with disulfiram (Figure 6C), which was antiproliferative at nM concentrations.</p>\n  Example 9: Disulfiram potentiates the antineoplastic effect of ciplatin and carmustine.</p>\n  M1619 melanoma cells were cultured in 10% FBS and RPMI 1640 at a density of 50,000 cells/well in 24 well plates. After 48 hours cisplatin and 2.5 \u03bcM disulfiram or DMSO (5 \u03bcl per ml) were added to medium. After an additional 24 hours, proliferation was quantitated. Each bar represents mean MTT formazan absorbance in a minimum of 4 experiments. \n\n M1619 cells were cultured as above with addition of carmustine and 0.6 \u03bcM disulfiram or DMSO (5 \u03bcl per ml) to medium. After 24 hours, proliferation was quantitated.</p>\n  Table 2 shows that the combination of disulfiram and cisplatin or disulfiram and carmustine is significantly more antiproliferative against M 1619 cells than cisplatin or carmustine alone. Each number represents mean MTT formazan absorbance in a minimum of 4 experiments. <sup>\u039b</sup>p &lt; 0.05 compared to DMSO vehicle; <sup>B</sup>p &lt; 0.01 compared to DMSO vehicle; <sup>c</sup>p &lt; 0.001 compared to DMSO vehicle. Disulfiram was more potent as a growth inhibitor of neoplastic cell lines than its sulfhydryl-containing relative PDTC. As an example, the 50% inhibitor concentration (IC50) against Ml 585 melanoma cells was approximately 1.25 \u03bcM for PDTC but was only 0.3 \u03bcM for disulfiram. This suggests that the active antiproliferative construct of thiocarbamates might be the oxidized dimeric disulfide rather than the reduced thiol-containing monomeric form employed frequently as an antioxidant. \n\n</p>\n  TABLE 2</p>\n  DISULFIRAM POTENTIATES</p>\n  THE ANTIPROLIFERATIVE ACTIVITY OF CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENTS</p>\n  A540 of MTT Formazan</p>\n  A.
