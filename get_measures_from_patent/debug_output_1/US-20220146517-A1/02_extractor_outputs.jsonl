{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n* In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein has a dissociation constant (Kd) of \u22641 \u03bcM.\n* Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIACORE, Inc.) are activated with N-ethyl-N\u2032-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions, and antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, to 5 \u03bcg/ml (\u02dc0.2 \u03bcM) before injection at a flow rate of 5 \u03bcl/minute to achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled protein, and two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% polysorbate 20 (TWEEN-20\u2122) surfactant (PBST) at 25\u00b0 C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 \u03bcl/min.\n* The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) is calculated as the ratio k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>, and if the on-rate exceeds 10^6 M\u22121 s\u22121 by the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation=295 nm; emission=340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25\u00b0 C. of a 20 nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen."}
