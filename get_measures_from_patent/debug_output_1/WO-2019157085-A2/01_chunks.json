Original magnification, *4 (top row); x lO (bottom row). (FIG. 3B) The medial femoral condyle and medial tibial plateau were scored using the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) system by two independent blinded readers, and both regions had significantly lower scores with Wnt inhibition compared w </p> ith saline group. (FIG. 3C) Chondrocyte cellularity was significantly reduced in saline- treated group compared with Wnt inhibitor-treated group. (FIGS. 3D-E) Masson\u2019s trichrome staining further showed reduced significant reduction in the degree of synovitis in Wnt inhibitor-treated group compared with saline-treated group. Original magnification, xlO (left); x4 (right). (FIGS. 3B, 3C and 3E) Statistical analysis was performed using a t test, *P &lt; 0.05, \u00ab = 8. For data presented as box-and-whiskers plots, horizontal lines indicate the medians, cross marks indicate the means, boxes indicate the 25th to 75th percentiles, and whiskers indicate the minimum and maximum values of the data set. </p> FIGS. 4A-C. Proliferation of synovial fibroblasts is elevated in OA and can be moderated through Wnt inhibition. (FIG. 4A) Immunohistochemistry of Ki-67 on knee synovia from saline control and Wnt inhibitor mice 10 weeks after surgery showed a reduction in proliferation of synovial fibroblasts after treatment with Wnt inhibitor. Original magnification, x20 (top); x40 (bottom). (FIG. 4B) Knee synovia were stained by immunofluorescence with periostin (green) and PCNA (red), a proliferating cell marker, and \n\n counterstained with nuclear DAPI (blue). The stained region is represented by the box in the H&amp;E stain of the joint Synovia from saline-treated control mice demonstrated increased levels of periostin- and PCNA-positive cells, when compared with XAV-939-treated synovia. Additional sections from the same joint from the XAV-939-treated mouse were used as the isotype control. Images from the same joint region were used, although they are from separate sections. The H&amp;E image is therefore reused. The representative isotype control shows minimal staining. Original magnification, x lO (top row); x80 (bottom 4 rows). (FIG. 4C) Proliferation was assessed by BrdU assay on synovial fibroblasts isolated from unaffected and osteoarthritis (OA) patients. Basal proliferation levels were significantly upregulated in OA patient fibroblasts compared with controls. Furthermore, WNT3A treatment of unaffected fibroblasts also significantly upregulated proliferation. Wnt inhibition in OA fibroblasts decreased the proliferation rate. Two-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test was performed, *P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01, n = 6. For data presented as box-and-whiskers plots, horizontal lines indicate the medians, cross marks indicate the means, boxes indicate the 25th to 75<sup>th</sup> percentiles, and whiskers indicate the minimum and maximum values of the data set. </p> FIGS. 5A-B. Wnt inhibitor treatment results in decreased collagen type I expression.

Wnt inhibitor treatment of chondrocytes does not alter proliferation but modifies gene expression. (FIG. 6A) Immunohistochemistry of Ki-67 in the joint space from control and Wnt inhibitor mice 10 weeks after surgery demonstrated no detectable proliferation of chondrocytes after treatment with Wnt inhibitor. Original magnification, x40. (FIG. 6B) Joints were stained with H&amp;E and also by immunofluorescence with SOX9 (green), a marker for chondrocytes, and PCNA (red), a proliferating cell marker, and counterstained \n\n with DAPI (blue). Additional sections from the same joint from the XAV-939-treated sample were used as the isotype control. Images from the same joint region were used, although they are from separate sections. The H&amp;E image is therefore reused. Isotype controls showed background but no nuclear staining. Original magnification, <sup>c</sup> 10 (first column); <sup>c</sup> 80 (rightmost 4 rows). (FIG. 6C) Costained PCNA-positive and SOX9-positive cells were quantified, and no significant difference was detected between control and treated groups. Statistical analysis by t test was performed, P &gt; 0.05. n = 3. (FIG. 6D) Chondrocytes were isolated from patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and stained by immunofluorescence for type II collagen (green) and DAPI (blue) to confirm phenotype. Isotype controls did not show any collagen type II staining. Original magnification, *20.

(FIG. 6F) Real-time RT-PCR of AXIN2 demonstrates that chondrocytes are responsive to Wnt acti",
    "eviously (Vashegnhani el al, 2015; Zhang el al, 2015). Three weeks after surgery, five intra-articular injections of XAV-939 (0.4 mM, Seleck Chemicals, S 1180) or saline were administered at 10- day intervals, with a total volume of 5 pl. Knee joints from control (n = 8) and Wnt inhibitor mice ( n = 8) were collected at 10 weeks after surgery. </p> Histology. Joints were fixed overnight in TissuFix (Chaptec), decalcified for 1.5 hours in RDO Rapid Decalcifier (Apex Engineering), and further fixed in TissuFix overnight, followed by embedding in paraffin and sectioning. Sections were deparaffinized in xylene, followed by a graded series of alcohol washes. To determine the extent of cartilage deterioration, sections were stained with Safranin O/Fast Green (Millipore-Sigma), and the histological scoring method issued by OARSI was used for analysis as described previously \n\n (Glasson et al, 2010; Vasheghani et al, 2015; Zhang et al, 2015). To determine degree of synovitis, joint sections were stained with Masson\u2019s tri chrome stain and scored on a scale of 0-3 (0, no synovitis; 1, mild synovitis; 2, moderate synovitis; and 3, severe synovitis) (Glasson et al, 2010). Subchondral bone plate histomorphometry was performed on Safranin O/Fast Green-stained sections of knee joints of control and Wnt inhibitor-treated groups. Blinded histomorphometric assessment was performed on the medial compartment as described previously (Valverde-Franco et al, 2012). Immunohistochemical staining for Ki-67 (Cell Signaling, 12202S), F480 (Novus Biologicals, NB600-404), CD68 (Leica, PA0191), and aSMA (ThermoFisher Scientific, RB-9010-P1) was performed by the Vanderbilt Translational Pathology Shared Resource. Briefly, the Leica Bond Max IHC Stainer was used for deparaffmization, heat-induced antigen retrieval was performed with Epitope Retrieval 2 solution (Leica), blocking was performed with Protein Block (DAKO, 0909), and primary antibody incubation and visualization were performed with the Bond Refine Polymer detection system Slides were then dehydrated, cleared, and mounted. Two independent readers evaluated slides in a blinded fashion. </p> Plasma sample processing. Plasma was isolated from the saphenous vein of 10-week- old male C57BL/6J mice before injection with saline or XAV-939, 3 and 24 hours after injection. Plasma was stored at -80\u00b0C in 2-ml polypropylene tubes and allowed to thaw on ice before processing. Aliquots of thawed plasma (25 ml) were transferred to clean microcentrifuge tubes and spiked with the internal standard carbamazepine (2.5 ml). Calibration standards (25 ml) were spiked with internal standard and the appropriate working stocks of XAV-939 (2.5 ml). Spiked samples were lightly vortexed, allowed to stand at room temperature for 15-20 minutes, and deproteinized with 75 ml cold acetonitrile. Precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation (18,000 g, 30 minutes, 5 \u00b0C). The clear supernatant (~75 ml) of each sample was transferred to a clean Ep",
    "oral condyle in the Wnt inhibitor-treated group compared with saline-treated controls. Chondrocyte cellularity analysis further showed greater chondrocyte loss in the saline-treated group compared with the Wnt inhibitor-treated group (FIG. 3C). To assess \n\n synovitis, Masson\u2019s tri chrome staining was performed, and the degree of synovitis was blindly scored as described previously (Krenn el al, 2002) (FIGS. 3D-E). Results showed a marked reduction in the degree of synovitis in the Wnt inhibitor-treated group compared with the saline-treated group. The inventor also performed subchondral bone plate histomorphometry in the Wnt inhibitor-treated group compared with the saline-treated group as previously described (Valverde-Franco el al. , 2012). Results showed no significant differences in the subchondral bone plate thickness in the Wnt inhibitor-treated group compared with the saline- treated group (data not shown). </p> Wnt inhibition reduces both proliferation and type I collagen levels of synovial fibroblasts. The inventor sought to assess the cellular effects of Wnt inhibitors on synovial fibroblasts to clarify the basis for the observed decrease in synovitis. Increased proliferation of synovial fibroblasts has been shown in the context of OA and rheumatoid arthritis (Bhattaram et al. , 2017; Lacey et al. , 2003; Qu et al. , 1994). She identified that treatment with XAV-939 reduced the numbers of proliferating fibroblasts in the synovium, as assessed by immunostaining with Ki-67 and PCNA on sections from control- or XAV-939-treated mice after DMM injury (FIGS. 4A-B). To determine if Wnt directly modulated synovial fibroblast proliferation, the inventor assessed the proliferation response of isolated human synovial fibroblasts by BrdU incorporation assay (FIG. 4C). Synovial fibroblasts from OA patients showed significantly higher basal levels of proliferation than fibroblasts from healthy controls. While both unaffected and OA synovial fibroblasts demonstrated an increase in proliferation with the addition of WNT3A, the effect was only significant in synovial fibroblasts from unaffected patients. The elevated basal proliferation rate of OA-derived synovial fibroblasts may be an explanation for the lack of response in the presence of WNT3A. Importantly, both small-molecule Wnt inhibitors resulted in a statistically significant decrease in proliferation of OA-derived synovial fibroblasts to below basal levels. The antiproliferative effect of XAV-939 and C 113 on unaffected synovial fibroblasts demonstrated a decreased trend but did not achieve statistical significance. </p> The primary constituent of synovial fibrotic matrix is collagen type I, which is produced by synovial fibroblasts (Remst et al. , 2014). Since there was a striking effect of XAV-939 treatment on synovitis, the inventor further assessed the effect of Wnt modulation on type I collagen synthesis of synovial fibroblasts in vitro. Treatment of cultured synovial fibroblasts with WNT3A ligand resulted in a significant increase in COL1A1 transcript levels, and this increase was not only abrogated with the addition of either Wnt inhibitor, but levels were \n\n reduced to below baseline (Cl 13 = 43.77%, XAV-939 = 83.09%) (FIG. 5A). As further confirmation, the inventor demonstrated the same trends in collagen type I protein expression (FIG. 5B). Taken together, Wnt inhibitors addressed two key aspects of synovial fibrosis by reducing both proliferation of synovial fibroblasts and their synthesis of type I collagen. </p> Effect of Wnt modulation on OA-derived human articular chondrocytes. The inventor sought to evaluate Wnt-mediated effects on cartilage/chondrocytes. To determine whether XAV-939 treatment was inducing proliferation of chondrocytes in the articular cartilage, the inventor performed immunostaining of both Ki-67 and PCNA on control or treated murine joints (FIGS. 6A-C). Staining of the joint space showed no significant difference in the proliferative activity of the chondrocytes. To further confirm that Wnt inhibition did not induce proliferation, chondrocytes were isolated from the articular cartilage of patients with OA and were verified by expression of the chondrocyte-specific marker, collagen type II (FIG. 6D). The inventors utilized a BrdU incorporation assay and noted no significant differences in the proliferative activity of the cells with Wnt pathway activation or inhibition, supporting the inventor\u2019s finding that the cartilage-sparing effects observed with XAV-939 treatment were not due to promoting chondrocyte regeneration (FIG. 6E). </p> The inventor next determined whether chondrocytes were responsive to Wnt signaling by evaluating AXIN2 transcript levels by real-time RT-PCR (FIG. 6F). AXIN2 expression was activated &gt;22-fold 24 hours after activation with WNT3A, and addition of either XAV-939 or Cl 13 significantly reduced Wnt signaling activation, as gauged by AXIN2 transcript levels. She next assessed if the cartilage-sparing effects of Wnt inhibitors may be modulating expression of type II collagen matrix or the expression of lubricin, encoded by PRG4, a proteoglycan secreted by chondrocytes that has been shown to play a positive role in OA in animal models (Alquraini et al, 2015; Waller et al, 2017; Heathfield et al, 2001; Jia et al, 2016).
