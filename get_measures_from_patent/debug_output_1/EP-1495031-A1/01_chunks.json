The mixture is heated to 85\u00b0C for 18 h. The mixture then is partitioned between water and CH<sub>2</sub>CI2. The layers are separated and the organic layer washed twice with water (200 mL). The organic layer is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated.

Sibley's laboratory in National Institute of Health (see Sibley, D.R., Neurochemistry. 66, 47-56, 1996). Cells were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with L-glutamine, 0.5% sodium pyruvate, 0.3% penicillin-streptomycin, 0.025% G-418 and 5% Gibco fetal bovine serum and then were harvested, when confluent, in cold phosphate buffered saline.</p>\n  Harvested intact cells were washed once in cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in 100 ml of cold 50 mM Tris, 5 mM EDTA and 5 mM EGTA, pH 7.4. Homogenization was with a Nir Tishear generator, 4 cycles for 30 seconds each at setting 50. The homogenized cells were centrifuged at 700 RPM (1000 X g) for 10 minutes and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was resuspended in 100 ml of the above buffer and rehomogenized for 2 cycles. The rehomogenized cells were then centrifuged at 700 RPM (1000 X g) for 10 minutes and the supernatant was removed. The combined supernatant (200ml) was centrifuged at 23,000 RPM (80,000 X g) for 1 hour in a Beck an Rotor (42.1 Ti). The membrane pellet was resupended in 50-8- ml of assay buffer containing HEPES 20 mM, MgC12 10 mM, \u039daCl 150 mM, EDTA lmM, pH 7.4 and stored frozen in aliqouts at -70\u00b0C.</p>\n  5-HT<sub>6</sub> Receptor Binding Assay</p>\n  The radioligand binding assay used [ H] -lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). The assay was carried out in Wallac 96-well sample plates by the addition of 11 \u03bcl of the test sample at the appropriate dilution (the assay employed 11 serial concentrations of samples run in duplicate), 11 \u03bcl of radioligand, and 178 \u03bcl of a washed mixture of WGA-coated SPA beads and membranes in binding buffer. The plates were shaken for about 5 minutes and then incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. The plates were then loaded into counting cassettes and counted in a Wallac MicroBeta Trilux scintillation counter. Binding Constant (Ki) Determination</p>\n  Eleven serial dilutions of test compounds were distributed to assay plates using the PE/Cetus Pro/Pette pipetter. These dilutions were, followed by radioligand and the bead-membrane mixture prepared as described above. The specifically bound \n\ncpm obtained were fit to a one-site binding model using GraphPad Prism ver. 2.0. Estimated IC<sub>50</sub> values were converted to Ki values using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (Cheng, Y. C. et al., Biochem. Pharmacol.. 22, 3099-108, 1973). The Ki values obtained from the assay are shown in Table 1.</p>\n  TABLE 1: 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptor Binding Assay Data</p>\n  \n    \n  </p>\n  \n    \n  </p>\n  Blood-Brain Barrier Penetration</p>\n  Pharmacokinetics of the compounds of formula I can be evaluated in mice to determine the ability of each compound to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Each mouse receives a single intravenous administration at 5 mg/kg. Blood samples are collected by serial sacrifice at 5 min (IN only), 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 h after dosing with two mice per collection time. Blood was placed into tubes containing heparin and centrifuged for plasma. Brain samples were also collected at 0.5 and 1 h increments from the same mouse used for blood collection. Plasma and brain samples were analyzed for drug concentrations using a LC-MS/MMS method. Pharmacokinetics (clearance, volume of distribution, and half -life) were evaluated from the plasma concentration-time data (See Gibaldi and Perrier in Pharmacokinetics, Nol I, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed, New York: Marcel Dekker, 1982). Compounds having a large volume of distribution will have good distribution into the body tissues. Comparison of the drug concentration in brain and plasma (brain/plasma ratio) provides the direct information of brain penetration. Higher numbers refer to higher brain penetration. \n</p>\n"
