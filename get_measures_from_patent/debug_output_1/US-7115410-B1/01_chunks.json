    " by alternative splicing of coding regions, i.e., exons, from the \u03b2-secretase gene.</p>\u201cSplice variants\u201d of \u03b2-secretase, when referred to in the context of the protein itself, are \u03b2-secretase translation products that are encoded by alternatively-spliced \u03b2-secretase mRNA transcripts.</p>A \u201cmutant\u201d amino acid or polynucleotide sequence is a variant amino acid sequence, or a variant polynucleotide sequence, which encodes a variant amino acid sequence that has significantly altered biological activity or function from that of the naturally occurring protein.</p>A \u201csubstitution\u201d results from the replacement of one or more nucleotides or amino acids by different nucleotides or amino acids, respectively.</p>The term \u201cmodulate\u201d as used herein refers to the change in activity of the polypeptide of the invention. Modulation may relate to an increase or a decrease in biological activity, binding characteristics, or any other biological, functional, or immunological property of the molecule.</p>The terms \u201cantagonist\u201d and \u201cinhibitor\u201d are used interchangeably herein and refer to a molecule which, when bound to the polypeptide of the present invention, modulates the activity of enzyme by blocking, decreasing, or shortening the duration of the biological activity. An antagonist as used herein may also be referred to as a \u201c\u03b2-secretase inhibitor\u201d or \u201c\u03b2-secretase blocker.\u201d Antagonists may themselves be polypeptides, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, lipids, small molecules (usually less than 1000 kD), or derivatives thereof, or any other ligand which binds to and modulates the activity of the enzyme.</p>\u03b2-Secretase Compositions</p>The present invention provides an isolated, active human \u03b2-secretase enzyme, which is further characterized as an aspartyl (aspartic) protease or proteinase, optionally, in purified form. As defined more fully in the sections that follow, \u03b2-secretase exhibits a proteolytic activity that is involved in the generation of \u03b2-amyloid peptide from \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (APP), such as is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,744,346, incorporated herein by reference. Alternatevely, or in addition, the \u03b2-secretase is characterized by its ability to bind, with moderately high affinity, to an inhibitor substrate described herein as P10\u2014P4\u2032 staD\u2192V (SEQ ID NO.: 72). According to an important feature of the present invention, a human form of \u03b2-secretase has been isolated, and its naturally occurring form has been characterized, purified and sequenced.</p>According to another aspect of the invention, nucleotide sequences encoding the enzyme have been identified. In addition, the enzyme has been further modified for expression in altered forms, such as truncated forms, which have similar protease activity to the naturally occurring or full length recombinant enzyme. Using the information provided herein, practitioners can isolate DNA encoding various active forms of the protein from available sources and can express the protein recombinantly in a convenient e"
