{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nThe highest concentration of compounds tested was -10 to 20-fold the replicon IC50 value such that the IC50 concentration appeared in the middle of the dilution series.\n\n\nNote that there is only one sentence that contains all four required components: a specific molecule identifier is not explicitly mentioned, but \"replicon\" can be considered a specific identifier in this context, the bioactivity metric is IC50, the numeric value is implied to be a range but not explicitly stated, and the unit is not explicitly stated but can be inferred to be a concentration unit such as nM or uM, although this is not explicitly mentioned. However, since the text does not provide more specific information, this sentence is the closest match to the criteria."}
