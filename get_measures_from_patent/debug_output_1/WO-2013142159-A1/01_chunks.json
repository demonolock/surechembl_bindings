    "plying the 4-parametric curve fitting method using the SoftMaxPro software (Molecular Devices, Inc., Sunnyvale CA) to derive CC<sub>50</sub> values (concentration of compound that results in a 2-fold reduction in ceil viability). Each compound concentration was tested at least in duplicates and the average value of replicates was used for curve fitting. \n\n In vitro combination assays </p> [0184] Drug combination studies were carried out using the transient replicon system described above. On day one, in vitro transcribed RNA of GT lb WT replicon carrying the firefly Iuciferase reporter was transfected into Huh-7-ET-cured cells using the Mirus transfection reagent. Approximately, ten thousand transfected cells were cultured in complete DMEM medium [DMEM medium supplemented with 2 mM L-giutamine, 1 x non-essential amino acids, 10 % heat inactivated fetal bovine serum and PenStrep (100 units/rnL penicillin and 100 ^ig/mL streptomycin)] in central 60 wells of 96-well, flat bottom, tissue culture treated plates and cultured at 37\u00b0C/5%C0<sub>2</sub> humidified incubator for 24h. Hie next day, compounds were serially diluted (2x or 3x dilution series) in 100% DMSO, mixed together in a checkerboard fashion and added to cells, and the plates were returned to the incubator for an additional 72h. Each concentration combination of two compounds was tested in 4 replicates for effect on I V replicon replication. The highest concentration of compounds tested was -10 to 20-fold the replicon IC50 value such that the IC<sub>50</sub> concentration appeared in the middle of the dilution series. At the end of the incubation period, the cells from one set of plates were lysed and the Iuciferase activity was measured using a Iuciferase assay kit. </p> [0185] The effects of drug-drug combinations were evaluated using the Bliss independence model (Greco W , Bravo G, Parsons JC. The search for synergy: a critical review from a response surface perspective. Pharmacol Rev. 1995, 47(2): 331-385). The experimental data (RLU) were analyzed by using MacSynergy, a three-dimensional analytical method developed by Prichard and Shipman (Prichard MN and Shipman C Jr.). A three-dimensional model to analyze drug-drug interactions, Antiviral Res 1990. 14(4-5): 181 -205). In this model, the theoretical additive effect is calculated from the dose-response curves of individual compounds by the equation Z <sup>::::</sup> X+ H I .Vs. where X and Y represent the inhibition produced by drug 1 alone and drug 2 alone, respectively and Z represents the effect produced by the combination of drug 1 and drug 2. The theoretical additive surface is subtracted from the actual experimental surface, resulting in a surface that would appear as a horizontal plane at 0% inhibition if the combination is merely additive, Any peak above this plane would indicate synergy, whereas any depression belo it would indicate antagonism. The 95% confidence intervals for the experimental dose-response surface are used t"
