Antibody binding to the cyno CLDN6 overexpression cell line and the human CLDN6 positive cancer cell line (PA-1) was measured by flow cytometry. Briefly, 100 pL of hybridoma culture supernatant and CLDN-expressing cancer cell line (such as PA-1 or CHOKl/human CLDN6 and CHOKl/human CLDN9 stable cell lines) or control cells (such as parental CHOK1) were co-incubated for 30-60 min, washed, and incubated with anti-mouse IgG Fc secondary Ab conjugated to APC. After incubation and washing, fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry. </p>Example 3. Subcloning of selected CLDN6 Ab-secreting hybridomas </p>[203] Selected CLDN6 antibody-secreting hybridomas were subcloned once or twice to ensure monoclonality. Briefly, approximately 80-100 viable hybridoma cells were plated in 3 m of semi-solid methylcellulose medium (Stem Cell Technologies) in 6 well plate. After 7-10 days, hybridoma colonies arising from single cells as visible clones were picked to 96-well plate, and were further cultured for 2-4 days in fresh medium. Culture supernatant was screened by ELISA and flow cytometry as previously described to confirm human and cyno CLDN6 binding. Stable \n\nhybridoma subclones were cultured in vitro for cell cryopreservation, antibody producing and antibody VH and VL gene cloning and sequencing. </p>Example 4. Determination of CLDN6 binding EC50 values for mouse anti-CLDN6 antibodies </p>[204] The selected anti-CLND6 antibody-secreting hybridomas after subcloning were plated in T75 flask with 40 ml fresh 1640 medium supplemented with 2% FBS for the antibody producing. After 7-10 days of culture, the hybridoma supernatants were harvested for the antibody purification using protein A column. Then binding activity of mouse anti-CLDN6 antibodies to CLDN6 positive cells were characterized using flow cytometry. The EC50 values of clone BG87P are presented in Tables 4-6. The data indicates that clone BG87P binds to human CLDN6 but not to human CLDN9. In addition, BG87P binds to mouse CLDN6 and cyno CLDN6. </p>Table 4.

All humanized variants were expressed by co-transfection \n\nof the above two constructs into HEK293T cells and purified using a protein A column (Cat: 17- 5438-02, GE Life Sciences.). The purified antibody was concentrated to 0.5-10mg/ml in PBS and stored in aliquots in -80\u00b0C Freezer. </p>Determination of cell binding activity of 1<sup>st</sup> round of humanized BG87P variants (hBG87P) and PTM removal variants </p>[210] For affinity determination, CLDN6 over-expressing HEK293T cells and cancer cell line PA-1 which express high levels of human CLDN6 were used to evaluate the binding activity of BG87P related engineering variants. Live cells were seeded in 96-well plate, and were incubated with a series of dilutions of chBG87P and engineered variants thereof. Goat anti-human IgG was used as second antibody to detect antibody binding to the cell surface. EC50 values for dosedependent binding to CLDN6 expressing cell lines were determined by fitting the dose-response data to the four-parameter logistic model with GraphPad Prism. Cell binding activity of 1 <sup>st</sup> round of BG87P humanization variants against HEK293T/human CLDN6 were compared to chBG87P and shown in FIG. 1A. Cell binding affinity (EC50) and Emax (MFI) of 1<sup>st</sup> round of humanized variants was normalized to chBG87P for directly comparison and ranking (Table 7). </p>[211] Beginning with the chBG87P antibody and BG87P-BzO, several additional amino acid changes in the CDR regions of both VH and VL were made to further improve the biophysical properties for therapeutics use in human. The considerations included removing post translational modifications (PTM), improved heat stability (Tm), while maintaining binding activities, the resulted variants are BG87P-ml (VH SEQ ID NO: 31 and VL SEQ ID NO: 8), BG87P-m2 (VH SEQ ID NO: 32 and VL SEQ ID NO: 8), BG87P-m3 (VH SEQ ID NO: 33 and VL SEQ ID NO: 8), and BG87P-m4 (VH SEQ ID NO: 34 and VL SEQ ID NO: 8) and BG87P- m5 (VH SEQ ID NO: 35 and VL SEQ ID NO: 14), BG87P-m6 (VH SEQ ID NO: 36 and VL SEQ ID NO 14), BG87P-m7 (VH SEQ ID NO: 37 and VL SEQ ID NO: 14), and BG87P-m8 (VH SEQ ID NO: 38 and VL SEQ ID NO: 14). Cell binding activity of chBG87P and BG87P- BzO related PTM removal variants against HEK293T/human CLDN6 was compared with chBG87P and BG87-BzO, respectively (FIG. IF). Cell binding affinity (EC50) and Emax (MFI) was normalized to chBG87P for directly comparison and ranking (Table 7). The results demonstrated that except for the mutation of H33A which resulted as BG87P-m4 and BG87P- \n\nm8, other replacements of potential detrimental residues maintained the binding capacity of respective parental ones. </p>Table 7.

PTM removal mutation VH: V65G, which site with a higher popularity of G (G62%; V&lt;1%) in human germline indicated a potential benefit in antibody framework stability, was involved in variant BG87P-m3, showed improved Emax and EC50 as compared to chBG87P in FIG. IF and Table 7 which was incorporated in 2<sup>nd</sup> round combination for further validation. The VH and VL sequences of resulted 2<sup>nd</sup> round humanized variants BG87P-21, BG87P-22, BG87P-23, BG87P-24, BG87P-25, BG87P-26, and BG87P-27 are given in Table 1. </p>[213] After identification of the cell binding activity of humanized combination variants as shown in FIG. IB and FIG. 1C in HEK293T/human CLDN6 cells and FIG. ID and FIG. IE of PA-1 cells, BG87P-21 was selected as the top humanized candidate for further consideration (VH and VL amino acid sequences are SEQ ID NO: 24 and 12 respectively). BG87P-21 included critical back mutation site VH: T28S and PTM site VH: V65G, which revealed a comparable cell \n\nbinding affinity as compared to chBG87P. The Emax was reduced of 22% in HEK293T/human CLDN6 and 40% in PA-1 (Table 7 and Table 8). </p>Developability evaluation of humanized anti-CLDN6 antibodies </p>[214] Biophysical properties were profiled for the identification of top humanized anti-CLDN6 antibody. The data indicates that BG87P-21 shows a moderate to high risk in hydrophobicity, subsequent of risk in self-interaction in PBS buffer which exhibited by the AC-SINS, B22KD and CIC readouts.

The results were summarized in Table 9, which indicates both chBG87P and humanized variant BG87P-21 showed good thermostability. </p>[217] For determination of the aggregation propensity of BG87P related engineering variants, static light scattering intensity was measured using a Uncle system (Unchained Labs). During the measurement, approximately 8.8 pL protein sample at Img/ml was loaded to the cuvette; the samples were held at 25\u00b0C for 120 seconds, and then ramped to 95\u00b0C at the rate of 0.3\u00b0C/min. The scattering data was collected at an angle of 90\u00b0with a laser wavelength of 266 nm. Tagg (aggregation temperature) were analyzed and calculated by Uncle Analysis Software. The results were summarized in Table 9. Both chBG87P and humanized variants showed acceptable Tagg. </p>[218] CIC is a technique to identify antibody candidates with poor solubility or non-specific binding propensity. IgG from human serum or other ligands were chemically coupled to an NHS-activated chromatography resin. The retention times of proteins were tested on this resin using a HPLC to evaluate proteins solubility. After column coupling with IgG from human serum, The antibody sample and the sample buffer were diluted with mobile phase (PBS) to 0.1 mg/mL. The diluted sample and buffer were transferred to HPLC vial for LC-MS analysis. The result summarized in Table 9 indicates that both chBG87P and BG87P-21 show acceptable nonspecific interaction with human IgG. </p>[219] B22 and KD General description and intended use of the test method. The method is used to study weak protein-protein interactions, to predict the aggregation trend, to reveal the influence of formulation ingredients on intermolecular interactions and support the formulation buffer selection. Antibodies with buffer exchange samples were diluted to 1 mg/mL and centrifuge at 14000rpm for 30min, then check Tm, Tagg and DLS. Loading samples onto the Uni. 9pL/well. Each sample set a duplicate hole. Set equipment parameters following the guide of Uncle and run the experiment. In this experiment we used B22 &amp; Kd mode. Run information: Temperature (\u00b0C): 25. Incubation Time (sec): 120. No. of Acquisitions: 4. Acquisition Time (sec): 5. Attenuator Control: Auto. Laser. Control: Auto Run. For kd: diffusion interaction parameter, if the interaction of proteins increases as the concentration increases (attracting each other), then the proteins behave as if they become larger and the diffusion coefficient (KD) decreases (negative slope). For B22: second virial coefficient, if protein interactions increase \n\nwith increasing concentration (attracting each other), then proteins behave as if they are larger and 1/R90 decreasing (negative slope). The data indicated that in PBS, both chBG87P and humanized variants attract each other, tend to aggregate under this condition (Table 10). </p>[220] AC- SINS is the assay to obtain the self-interaction for the sample to predict the aggregation possibility. It is based on concentrating antibodies from diluted solutions around gold nanoparticles pre-coated with polyclonal capture. Interactions between immobilized antibodies lead to reduced inter-particle distances and increased plasmon wavelengths (wavelength of maximum absorbance), which can be readily measured by optical means. Dilute the antibodies with offering buffer to 0.05 mg/mL, respectively. After gold nanoparticle preparation, a 9:1 volume ratio was used to mix gold nanopartical solution with coating solution. After room temperature incubation for Ih, thilolated PEG (final concentration 0.1 uM) was used to block empty sites in AuNP. Then incubation for another 1 h at room temperature. The particle solution was then centrifuged at 15000 rpm for 6min. Upper solution discarded. Storage buffer at 1/10 of the starting volume was used to redissolve the particle.10 pL of the concentrated coated particles was incubated with 100 pL of the test antibody solution at room temperature for 2h in ",

CDRs of sp34 VH (SEQ ID NO: 48 - 50) were grafted into the framework of human germline variable gene IGVH3-7 with several murine framework residues (D73, S76, M89, V93) retained. </p>[230] Humanized sp34 (hu-sp34) and chimeric sp34 (ch-sp34) were constructed as human full- length antibody format using in-house developed expression vectors that contain constant regions of a human IgGl and kappa chain, respectively, with easy adapting sub-cloning sites. Expression and preparation of humanized sp34 and chimeric sp34 antibodies was achieved by co-transfection of the heavy chain and corresponding light chain constructs into 293 G cells (developed in house) and by purification using a protein A column. The purified antibodies were concentrated to 0.5-5 mg/mL in PBS and stored in aliquots in -80\u00b0C freezer for using in the assays below. </p>[231] For affinity determination, antibodies were captured by anti-human Fc surface, and used in the affinity-assay based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology. The binding activity of humanized sp34 to bind native CD3 on live cells was evaluated using HuT78 cells in a FACS based assay. Live HuT78 cells were seeded in 96-well plate, and were incubated with a series of dilutions of chimeric or humanized sp34. Mouse anti-Human IgG was used as second antibody to detect antibody binding to the cell surface. EC50 values for dose-dependent binding to human native CD3 were determined by fitting the dose-response data to the four-parameter logistic model with GraphPad Prism. The humanized sp34 BG53P (SEQ ID NO: 48 - 53 and 58 - 61) showed comparable binding affinity to ch-sp34 in both SPR assay and FACS assay (Table 15 and FIG. 4A). </p>Table 15 Comparison of binding affinities of hu-sp34 with ch-sp34 to CD3 by SPR and</p>FACS \n<img id=\"imgf000086_0001\" path=\"imgf000086_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/1296342491/WO/20240912/A1/002024/18/48/11/imgf000086_0001.tif\"/>\n \n\n\n<img id=\"imgf000087_0001\" path=\"imgf000087_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/1296342493/WO/20240912/A1/002024/18/48/11/imgf000087_0001.tif\"/>\n </p>[232] Based on humanized sp34 BG53P template, we made several single-mutations converting the retained murine residues in framework region to corresponding human germline residues which include four retained murine residues (D73, S76, M89, V93) in VH and fifteen retained murine residues (QI, A2, V4, V36, E38, L43, F44, T45, G46, G49, L66, D69, A71, 185, and F87) in VL.
