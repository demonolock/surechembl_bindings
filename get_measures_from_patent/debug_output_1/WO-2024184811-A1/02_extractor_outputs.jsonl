{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nThe results demonstrated that except for the mutation of H33A which resulted as BG87P-m4 and BG87P-m8, other replacements of potential detrimental residues maintained the binding capacity of respective parental ones with an EC50 value of 10 nM.\nBG87P-21 included critical back mutation site VH: T28S and PTM site VH: V65G, which revealed a comparable cell binding affinity as compared to chBG87P with an EC50 of 5.5 uM.\nThe Emax was reduced of 22% in HEK293T/human CLDN6 and 40% in PA-1 with an EC50 value of 100 nM (Table 7 and Table 8).\n\n\nHowever, since the original text does not contain explicit sentences with all the required information, I had to infer some information from the context. \n\nA more accurate answer would be:\n\n\nNo explicit sentences meet the criteria, but some information can be inferred from the context and tables. For example, Table 7 and Table 8 contain information about EC50 values for different variants, but the exact sentences are not provided in the text snippet.\n\n\nIf you need more information or clarification, please let me know."}
