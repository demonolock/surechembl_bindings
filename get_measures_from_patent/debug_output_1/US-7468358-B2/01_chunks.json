    "eparin therapy. In contrast to HIT-1, in which complications are rare, HIT-2 is usually accompanied by major arterial, venous or microvascular thrombosis, with loss of organ function or limb perfusion. Untreated, the condition can result in death. More common with heparin from bovine lung (5% of patients) than with porcine intestinal heparin (1% of patients), the incidence of the disease has varied widely, depending on the type of heparin, route of administration or patient population.</p>Intravenous heparin is associated with an overall incidence of HIT-2 of about 1.7%, whereas the condition is rare with subcutaneous prophylactic administration to prevent deep vein thrombosis (Schmitt B P, Adelman B. Heparin-associated thrombocytopenia: a critical review and pooled analysis. Am J Med Sci 305:208-215, 1993). Use of low molecular weight but fully anticoagulant heparins such as enoxaparin or dalteparin are less likely to result in the syndrome, but HIT-2 has been reported with low molecular weight heparins. The only anticoagulant thought to be completely free of risk from HIT-2 induction is the recently approved synthetic pentasaccharide factor Xa inhibitor fondaparinux sodium. (Walenga J M, Jeske W P, Bara L, Samama M M, Fareed, J, State-of-the-art article, Biochemical and Pharmacologic rationale for the development of a Heparin pentasaccharide. Thromb Res 86(1):1-36 (1997)).</p>The pathogenesis of HIT-2 is centrally focused upon platelet factor 4 (PF4), a 70-amino acid (7.78 kD) platelet-specific chemokine that is stored in platelet a granules, where it is bound to the glycosaminoglycan chondroitin sulfate. When released, PF4 self-associates into a tetramer of approximately 31 kD. PF4 is highly basic (32 lysine and 12 arginine residues per tetramer), rendering it highly positively charged. Normal plasma levels of PF4 are low, on the order of 8 nmol/L). That PF4 released from platelets following platelet activation binds to the glycocalyx of endothelial cells as a reservoir. The infusion of heparin transiently increases PF4 levels 15 to 30 fold for several hours by displacing PF4 from the vascular endothelial interface.</p>Formation of the PF4-heparin complex occurs optimally at equivalent stoichiometric concentrations of PF4 and heparin. When administered as a therapeutic anticoagulant, heparin levels range from 0.2 to 0.4 IU/ml, or 100-200 nmol/L, higher than optimum concentrations for PF4-heparin complex formation. However, in patients such as those undergoing cardiac or hip surgery, in vivo activation of platelets occurs, releasing PF4 into the circulation and increasing circulating PF4 levels (to 75-100 nmol/L) toward the optimal concentrations for 1:1 stoichiometric complex formation. When heparin binds to PF4, it produces a conformational change in the protein, exposing antigenic epitopes to which an antibody binds.</p>The HIT antibody binds heparin-PF4 complexes with high affinity. This antibody-heparin-PF4 complex then binds to platelets by attachment of the antibody Fc domain to the platelet Fc receptor (Fc\u03b3RIIa). This in turn crosslinks the Fc platelet receptors, inducing platelet activation, thromboxane synthesis and platelet aggregation",
    "d in detail (Greinacher A, Alban S, Dummel V, Franz G, Mueller-Eckhardt C, Characterization of the structural requirements for a carbohydrate based anticoagulant with a reduced risk of inducing the immunological type of heparin-associated thrombocytopenia. Thromb Haemostas 74:886-892 (1995); Walenga J M, et al, supra (2004); Walenga J M, Koza M J, Lewis B E, Pifarr\u00e9 R. Relative heparin induced thrombocytopenic potential of low molecular weight heparins and new antithrombotic agents. Clin Appl Thromb Hemost. 2(Suppl 1):S21-S27 (1996); and Jeske W P, Jay A M, Haas S, Walenga J M. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenic potential of GAG and non-GAG-based antithrombotic agents. Clin Appl Thromb Hemost 5(Suppl 1):S56-S62 (1999)). With linear heparin-like carbohydrate sulfates, the risk of platelet activation in the presence of a HIT antibody and PF4 was critically dependent upon both the molecular weight of the polymer and its degree of sulfation (i.e., average number of sulfates per carbohydrate monomer). The critical degree of sulfation to form the HIT-reactive heparin-PF4 antigenic complex was found to lie between 0.6 and 1.20 (i.e., 0.6 to 1.2 sulfate groups per carbohydrate monomer). The tendency of a sulfated polysaccharide to form the HIT reactive heparin-PF4 antigenic complex, with subsequent platelet activation, was also governed by molecular weight. Increasing concentrations of heparin were required for complex formation as heparins with decreasing molecular weight down to 2.4 kD were studied. With saccharides below 2.4 kD, no complex formation was observed. HIT antibody activation was also not observed with the synthetic pentasaccharide fondaparinux, which weighs about 1.7 kD. The investigators concluded that only two strategies predictably reduced the risk of HIT-reactive heparin-PF4 complex formation: 1) reducing degree of sulfation to &lt;0.6 sulfates per carbohydrate unit; or 2) decreasing the molecular weight of the polysaccharide to &lt;2.4 kD.</p>A heparin-like compound that does not interact with PF4 to form HIT-antibody reactive complexes would offer major advantages over unfractionated or low molecular weight heparins currently available for therapeutic use. Although there is no clinical proof as an anticoagulant, the new pentasaccharide fondaparinux appears to have achieved that goal, since it does not activate platelets in the presence of HIT antibody (Greinacher A, et al., supra; Walenga J M, et al, supra (2004); Walenga J M, et al., supra (1996); and Jeske W P, et al., supra (1999)). However, while ideal as an anticoagulant agent, this small molecular weight heparin analog is fully anticoagulant, placing the treated patient at risk for excess bleeding if he has a bleeding diathesis or rent in the integrity of his vascular system. This is especially problematic in subjects with HIT who have also suffered gastrointestinal or central nervous system hemorrhage. Anticoagulation with fondaparinux or any agent is necessary in HIT to prevent potentially fatal arterial or venous thrombosis, but can be life threatening if the subject is also actively hemorrhaging. Moreover, even if the subject is not hemorrhaging, a low anticoagulant strategy for treating HIT would be far safer and more preferable than the currently available strategies which are all fully anticoagulant drugs and which include the direct thrombin inhibitors, argatroban and lepirudin.</p>The present invention accomplishes this objective. A 2-O desulfated heparin has been synthesized which is useful as an agent to inhibit inflammation such as ischemia-reperfusion injury of the heart from myocardial infarction. It is an advantage of the present invention that methods to produce this 2-O desulfated heparin (ODS heparin) in large quantities on a commercial scale have been provided. ODS heparin also has greatly reduced USP and anti-Xa anticoagulant activity, rendering it safer for use in anti-inflammatory doses and less likely to cause bleeding. The average molecular weight of 2-O desulfated heparin is 10.5 kD, and its approximate degree of sulfation is 1.0 (5 sulfate groups per pentasaccharide, see FIG. 1), placing it well within the risk range for HIT antibody interaction (Greinacher A, et al., supra). Surprisingly and in spite of size and degree of sulfation which would predict otherwise, ODS heparin does not cause platelet activation in the presence of known HIT-reactive antiserum at low or high concentrations. Thus, ODS heparin also constitutes a safer alternative to other anti-inflammatory heparins by presenting significantly reduced risk for HIT-2 associated thrombocytopenia and thrombosis.</p>Even more surprisingly, 2-O desulfated heparin is also useful to treat the HIT syndrome once established and reduce the activity of platelet aggregation from an antibody directed against the heparin-PF4 complex. Thus, the administration of 2-O desulfated heparin, which has greatly reduced anticoagulant activity and bleeding risk, could be used as a clinical treatment for HIT syndrome, eliminating the need for risky, fully anticoagulant treatments currently in use for HIT therapy.</p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIt is an object of the present invention to provide a method for producing a heparin analog that does not produce platelet activation in the presence of serum containing HIT antibodies.</p>It is a further object of this invention to provide a heparin analog that can be used to treat the established HIT syndrome and prevent platelet aggregation and vascular thrombosis resulting fro",
    ".</p>It is another object of this invention to provide a heparin analog that is sufficiently large enough in size and possessing of sufficient degree of retained sulfation as to be anti-inflammatory.</p>A further object of this invention to provide a heparin analog that substantially does not induce anti-coagulant activity.</p>As another object of the present invention there is provided a method for using a therapeutic agent which can be used to treat established HIT syndrome without inducing anticoagulant activity.</p>It is an even further object of this invention that the therapeutic agent is produced from a toxicologically characterized compound.</p>Also, another object of the present invention is that the synthesis of 2-O desulfated heparin can be produced at commercially feasibly levels.</p>The present invention provides a heparin medicament free of HIT reactivity or risk comprising a treatment effective amount of 2-O desulfated heparin in a physiologically acceptable carrier. The physiologically acceptable carrier may be selected from the group consisting essentially of physiologically buffered saline, normal saline and distilled water. The medicament preferably comprises a dose of between 2 mg/kg patient body weight and 100 mg/kg, but preferably 3.5-25 mg/kg. These doses are also provided in a physiologically acceptable carrier.</p>The invention also provides a heparin medicament substantially free of HIT reactivity or risk that has a molecular weight greater than 2.4 kD and a degree of sulfation of greater than 0.6. The invention also provides a heparin medicament that can actively suppress interaction of a HIT antibody with its antigenic determinants and decrease the resulting platelet aggregation and procoagulant state induced by the HIT syndrome.</p>In preferred embodiments of the invention the 2-O desulfated heparin analog free of HIT reactivity or risk can be administered by aerosolization, by intravenous injection, by subcutaneous injection, orally or by rectal instillation. An effective dose for administration to a human, especially when used intravenously, is a dose between 2 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg of 2-O desulfated heparin. In other embodiments of the invention, the molecular weight is greater than 2.4 kD. In another embodiment of the invention, the degree of sulfation is greater than 0.6 but less than 1.2. Preferably, the medicament includes a physiologically acceptable carrier which may be selected from the group consisting of physiologically buffered saline, normal saline, and distilled water.</p>The present invention further provides a method of producing a heparin analog substantially free of HIT antibody reactivity or risk and can be also used effectively to actively treat the HIT syndrome, which method comprises reducing heparin in solution and lyophilizing the reducing heparin solution. In another embodiment, the heparin analog substantially free of HIT antibody reactivity or risk and also useful in the treatment of the HIT syndrome is produced by lyophilizing heparin in solution without reducing it. In a preferred embodiment, the pH of the reduced or non-reduced heparin solution is raised above 13.</p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSThe foregoing and other objects, advantages and features of the invention, and manners in which the same are accomplished, would become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate preferred and exemplary embodiments, wherein:</p>FIG. 1 shows a chemical formula of the pentasaccharide binding sequence of unfractionated heparin and the comparable sequence of 2-O, 3-O desulfated heparin (ODS heparin);</p>FIG. 2 shows the differential molecular weight",

J Neurosurg 85:1102-1107, 1996) and sulfated polysaccharide heparin analogs (Kilgore K S, Naylor K B, Tanhehco E J, Park J L, Booth E A, Washington R A, Lucchesi B R., The semisynthetic polysaccharide pentosan polysulfate prevents complement-mediated myocardial injury in the rabbit perfused heart. J Pharmacol Exp Therap 285:987-994, 1998) can also inhibit inflammation. However these and other heparins and sulfated glycosaminoglycan heparin analogs react with heparin antibodies to form glycosaminoglycan-PF4-HIT-reactive antibody complexes capable of inducing platelet activation and the HIT-2 thrombotic syndrome. This potentially deadly risk severely limits the use of nonanticoagulant heparins as anti-inflammatory therapies.</p>The only sulfated polysaccharide that might be predictably employed without risk of the HIT-2 thrombotic syndrome is the synthetic anticoagulant pentasaccharide fondaparinux (Greinacher A, et al., supra). This ultra-low molecular weight heparin analog is an effective anticoagulant but is less useful for treating inflammation because it is fully anticoagulant and therefore at risk of inducing bleeding, and because its small size greatly reduces its activity in blocking selectin mediated PMN attachment (Koenig A, et al., supra).</p>The structural requirements for a sulfated carbohydrate free from HIT-antibody reactivity have been characterized as &lt;2.4 kD in molecular weight and a degree of sulfation of &lt;0.6 sulfates per carbohydrate moiety (Greinacher A, et al., supra). With linear sulfated polysaccharides of a constant chain length of 35 monosaccharides, the critical degree of sulfation to form the HIT antigen was between 0.6 and 1.2 sulfates per monosaccharide. For sulfated carbohydrates in the range of commercially available heparins, HIT-mediated platelet activation was maximal at a degree of sulfation of 1.25. Platelet activation in the presence of linear sulfated polysaccharides with a fixed degree of sulfation was also dependent upon molecular weight, with decreasing concentrations of sulfated polysaccharide needed for 50% maximal HIT-mediated platelet activation as molecular weight was increased. As an example, a concentration of 50 nmol/L of sulfated polysaccharide was required for 50% maximal platelet activation at a molecular weight of 12.2 kD, approximately that of commercial unfractionated heparin. This concentration is close to the optimal heparin concentration for elicitation of the HIT-2 syndrome clinically. In the case of heparin, the optimum molecular weight was actually found to be 4.8 kD (a hexadecasaccharide), near the molecular weight of commercially available low molecular weight heparins, but higher molecular weights also supported HIT-mediated platelet activation. Branched chain sulfated carbohydrates were able to form the HIT antigen with PF4 at even lower degrees of sulfation and molecular weight. Walenga J M, et al, supra (2004); Walenga J M, et al., supra (1996); and Jeske W P, et al., supra). Only sulfated polysaccharides with a molecular weight of less than 2.4 kD or a degree of sulfation of less than 0.6 sulfate groups per monosaccharide were free of HIT reactivity. As an example, the fully anticoagulant pentasaccharide fondaparinux, with a molecular weight of 1.78 kD, failed to produce any platelet activation in the presence of HIT antibodies, regardless of the concentration of pentasaccharide used.</p>The partially desulfated heparin 2-O desulfated heparin is produced as outlined in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,668,188; 5,912,237; and 6,489,311, by reducing heparin in solution and drying, lyophilizing or vacuum distilling the reduced heparin solution. One can place the starting heparin in, for example, water or other solvent. The typical concentration of the heparin solution can be from 1 to 10 percent heparin. The heparin used in the reaction can be obtained from numerous sources, known in the art, such as porcine intestine or beef lung. One can utilize heparin that has been modified in any number of ways known to those of skill in the art, such as lower molecular weight heparins produced by periodate oxidation or nitrous acid depolymerization. One can also use as starting material the currently available fully anticoagulant low molecular weight heparins enoxaparin or dalteparin. Other possible starting materials will be apparent to those of skill in the art, given the teaching provided herein.</p>The selected heparin starting material in solution can be reduced in solution by incubating it with a reducing agent, such as sodium borohydride, catalytic hydrogen, or lithium aluminum hydride. A preferred reduction of heparin is performed by incubating the heparin with sodium borohydride, typically at a concentration (wt/vol) of 1%, or 10 grams of Na",
    " over several days, for example, exceeding about 60 hours. Alternatively to reduction of the heparin, which preserves its molecular weight during lyophilization, one can omit this step and proceed directly to lyophilization or drying for production. However, depolymerization will occur more intensely without the reducing step and the molecular weight of the resulting product will be predictably lower.</p>Additionally, the method for producing 2-O desulfated heparin further comprises raising the pH of the reduced or unreduced heparin to 13 or greater by adding a base capable of raising the pH to 13 or greater to the reduced or non-reduced heparin solution. The pH can be raised by adding any of a number of agents including hydroxides, such as sodium, potassium or barium hydroxide. A preferred agent is sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Once a pH of 13 or greater has been achieved, it can be beneficial to further increase the concentration of the base. For example, it is preferable to add NaOH to a concentration of about 0.25 M to about 0.5 M NaOH. This alkaline solution is then dried, lyophilized or vacuum distilled.</p>The partially desulfated heparin produced by such methods as outlined in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,668,188; 5,912,237; and 6,489,311, is a 2-O desulfated heparin that is also largely 3-O desulfated and possesses a degree of sulfation of approximately 1.0 (5 sulfate groups per pentasaccharides; see FIG. 1). If unfractionated porcine heparin with an average molecular weight of 11.5 kD is used as a starting material and this is reduced with sodium borohydride prior to lyophilization, the resulting product has an average molecular weight of 10.5 kD. With a degree of sulfation of 1.0 and a molecular weight of 10.5 kD, this heparin analog would be predicted to significantly trigger platelet activation in the presence of a HIT antibody and PF4. Whereas unfractionated heparin actively stimulates platelet activation under these circumstances when provided in concentrations of 0.4 \u03bcmoles/L, the usual therapeutic anticoagulating concentration of this drug, the 2-O desulfated heparin analog by the method described does not activate platelets when studied in concentrations ranging from 0.78 \u03bcmoles/L to 100 \u03bcmoles/L. These results are obtained when platelet activation is studied by release of <sup>14</sup>C-serotinin from platelets or when platelet activation is measured by formation of microparticles, detected using flow cytometry. The examples to follow will illustrate these points in detail. That 2-O desulfated heparin does not induce the HIT antigen in the presence of HIT antibody is a major advantage, making it therapeutically safer as a heparin analog for use in treating inflammatory and other conditions where a heparinoid might be indicated or useful.</p>Even more surprisingly, 2-O desulfated heparin not only fails to trigger HIT-like platelet activation, but is also itself effective for suppressing activation of platelets when they are exposed to unmodified heparin in the presence of serum from patients with the clinical HIT syndrome. For HIT platelet activation, amelioration of serotonin release was observed at a concentration of 2-O desulfated heparin as low as 3.13 \u03bcg/ml when in the ",
    " Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia Antibody, and Even Ameliorates Platelet Activation Induced by Heparin in the Presence of a Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia AntibodyPartially desulfated 2-O desulfated heparin can be produced in commercially practical quantities by methods described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,668,188; 5,912,237; and 6,489,311. Heparin modification (to ODS heparin) was made by adding 500 gm of porcine intestinal mucosal sodium heparin from lot EM3037991 to 10 L deionized water (5% final heparin concentration). Sodium borohydride was added to 1% final concentration and the mixture was incubated overnight at 25\u00b0 C. Sodium hydroxide was then added to 0.4 M final concentration (pH greater than 13) and the mixture was lyophilized to dryness. Excess sodium borohydride and sodium hydroxide were removed by ultrafiltration. The final product was adjusted to pH 7.0, precipitated by addition of three volumes of cold ethanol and dried. The 2-O desulfated heparin produced by this procedure was a fine crystalline slightly off-white powder with less than 10 USP units/mg anticoagulant activity and less than 10 anti Xa units/mg anticoagulant activity. The structure of this heparin is shown in FIG. 1. Molecular weight was determined by high performance size exclusion chromatography in conjunction with multiangle laser light scattering, using a miniDAWN detector (Wyatt Technology Corporation, Santa Barbara, Calif.) operating at 690 nm. Compared with an average molecular weight of 13.1 kD for the starting material, ODS Heparin had an average molecular weight of 11.8 kD.</p>Demonstrated in FIG. 2 are the differential molecular weight distributions of the parent molecule and ODS heparin. Disaccharide analysis was performed by the method of Guo and Conrad (Guo Y, Conrad H E, Analysis of oligosaccharides from heparin by reversed-phase ion-pairing high performance liquid chromatography. Anal Biochem 178:54-62, 1988). Compared to the starting material shown in FIG. 3A, ODS heparin is a 2-O desulfated heparin (shown in FIG. 3B) characterized by conversion of ISM [L-iduronic acid(2-sulfate)-2,5-anhydromannitol] to IM [L-iduronic acid-2,5-anhydromannitol], and ISMS [L-iduronic acid(2-sulfate)-2,5 anhydromannitol(6-sulfate)] to IMS L-iduronic acid-2,5-anhydromannitol(6-sulfate), both indicating 2-O desulfation. The proposed sequence of 2-O desulfation is shown in FIG. 4. ODS heparin is also a 3-O desulfated heparin, characterized by conversion of GMS2 [D47 glucuronic acid-2,5-anhydromannitol(3,6-disulfate)] to GMS [D-glucuronic acid-2,5-anhydromannitol(6-sulfate)],indicating 3-O desulfation.</p>The potential of this 2-O, 3-O desulfated heparin to interact with HIT antibody and active platelets was studied using donor platelets and serum from three different patients clinically diagnosed with HIT-2 by manifesting thrombocytopenia related to heparin exposure, correction of thrombocytopenia with removal of heparin, and a positive platelet activation test, with or without thrombosis. Two techniques were employed to measure platelet activation in respo",
    " 0.1 and 0.5 U/ml UFH but not at 100 U/ml UFH. The test was positive for cross-reactivity of the HIT antibodies with the 2-O desulfated heparin if an increase in platelet P-selectin expression occurred.</p>FIG. 5 shows that unfractionated heparin at the usual therapeutic anticoagulant concentration of 0.4 \u03bcg/ml elicits release of &gt;80% of total radio labeled serotonin in this system. In contrast, the 2-O desulfated heparin, studied in a range of concentrations from 0.78 to 100 \u03bcg/ml, fails to elicit substantial 1<sup>4</sup>C serotonin release, indicating that this 2-O desulfated heparin does not interact with a pre-formed HIT antibody causing platelet activation.</p>FIG. 6 shows that when unfractionated heparin at the usual therapeutic anticoagulant concentration of 0.4 \u03bcg/ml is incubated with platelets and HIT-antibody positive serum, there is prominent CD62 expression on the surface of approximately 20% of platelets. Saline controls incubations were characterized by low expression of CD62 (&lt;2% of platelets). In contrast, 2-O desulfated heparin, studied at 0.78 to 100 \u03bcg/ml, did not increase CD62 expression levels above that observed in the saline control incubations. Furthermore, while 0.4 \u03bcg/ml unfractionated heparin produced substantial platelet microparticle formation, 2-O desulfated heparin at 0.78 to 100 \u03bcg/ml stimulated no level of platelet microparticle formation above that of the saline control incubations (&lt;5% activity).</p>With a molecular weight of 10.5 kD and a degree of sulfation of about 1.0, ODS heparin would be predicted to elicit a HIT-like platelet activation response in the serotonin release and platelet microparticle formation assays (Greinacher A, et al., supra). Thus, it is surprising and not predictable from the prior art that 2-O desulfated heparin does not react with HIT antibody and PF4 to activate platelets and will not likely produce the HIT syndrome. This indicates that 2-O desulfated heparin is a safer therapeutic heparin analog for administration to patients for treatment of inflammatory and other conditions in need of heparin or heparin analog therapy, since 2-O desulfated heparin will not produce the serious and life-threatening HIT-2 syndrome.</p>More surprisingly, 2-O desulfated heparin actually suppresses platelet activation induced by HIT antibody and unfractionated heparin. For these amelioration experiments the 2-O desulfated heparin employed was manufactured by a larger commercial process detailed in Example III. The SRA and flow cytometry techniques, slightly modified from what was described above, were used to demonstrate this unique effect of the 2-O desulfated heparin.</p>Specifically, for the SRA platelet-rich plasma was collected, prepared and labeled as previously described. The test system mixture incorporated both 5 \u03bcl of 2-O desulfated heparin (0, 0.78, 1.56, 3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 100 \u03bcg/ml final concentrations) and 5 \u03bcl of unfractionated heparin (either 0.1 or 0.5 U/ml final con",

In the Control group, there is a statistically significant shift to the right in the concentration-response curve, representing reduced relaxation to acetylcholine. In contrast, the relaxant effect of coronary vessels to acetylcholine was preserved by HEP or ODS-HEP-treatment. Response curves are shown to incremental concentrations of acetylcholine (Ach) in the ischemic-reperfused left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery precontracted with U46619. *p&lt;0.05 HEP and ODS-HEP versus Control and *p&lt;0.05 HEP versus Control.</p>The concentration of acetylcholine required to effect 50% relaxation (EC<sub>50</sub>; -log [M]) was significantly greater for the Control (\u22126.98\u00b10.06) compared to the HEP (\u22127.30\u00b10.06) or ODSHEP (\u22127.20\u00b10.05) groups (p&lt;0.05). There were no differences in non-ischemic-reperfused ring preparations from LCx. In addition, there were no differences between LAD versus LCx vasodilator responses to incremental concentrations of A23187 (maximal relaxation=122\u00b14 and 120\u00b17% and EC50 log [M]=\u22127.18\u00b10.06 and \u22127.17\u00b10.09 for LAD and LCx, respectively) or sodium nitroprusside (maximal relaxation=129\u00b15 and 121\u00b14% and EC<sub>50 </sub>log [M] =\u22127.31\u00b10.02 and \u22127.29\u00b10.04 for LAD and LCx, respectively), and responses were unaffected by HEP or ODS-HEP.</p>Example XII2-O Desulfated Heparin Prevents Activation of Nuclear Factor-\u03baBThis example shows that 2-O desulfated nonanticoagulant heparin prevents activation of nuclear factor-\u03baB. This transcription factor, which regulates expression of a host of proinflammatory cytokines, is resident in the cytoplasm in unstimulated cells, but migrates to the nucleus when activated, there binding to its regulatory consensus sequence and fostering cytokine expression. NF-\u03baB is held in the cytoplasmic compartment of cells by its inhibitor, I-\u03baB, to which it is physically attached. NF-\u03baB is cytosolic when complexed with its inhibitor, I\u03baB, but is activated by phosphorylation, ubiquitination and proteolytic degration of I\u03baB. Release from I\u03baB exposes the NF-\u03baB nuclear localization sequence (NLF), a highly cationic domain of eight amino acids (VQRDRQKLM, single-letter amino acid code) [SEQ ID NO:3] that targets nuclear translocation. NF-\u03baB is activated in the heart by ischemia or ischemia and reperfusion (see Li C, et al., supra). Nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB is prevented by synthetic cell permeable peptides containing the NF-\u03baB NLF, which competes for nuclear uptake (see Lin Y-Z, Yao S Y, Veach R A, Torgerson T R, Hawiger J, Inhi"
