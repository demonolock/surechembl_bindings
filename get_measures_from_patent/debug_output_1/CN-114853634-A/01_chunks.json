Evaluation of in vitro Activity: the in vitro enzymology level detection method adopts a PD-1/PD-L1 binding assay kit of Cisbio company.</p><p id=\"p0240\" num=\"0233\">Principle and method for screening PD-1/PD-L1 small-molecule inhibitor</p><p id=\"p0241\" num=\"0234\">1) The principle is as follows: PD-1 protein carries HIS label, ligand PD-L1 of PD-1 carries hFc label, anti-hFc antibody marked with Eu and anti-HIS antibody marked with XL665 respectively combine with two label proteins, after laser excitation, energy can be transferred from donor Eu to acceptor XL665, XL665 can emit light, and after inhibitor (compound or antibody) is added, binding of PD-1 and PD-L1 is blocked, Eu and 665 are far away, energy can not be transferred, XL665 can not emit light.</p><p id=\"p0242\" num=\"0235\">2) The experimental method comprises the following steps: as a specific method, reference may be made to PD-1/PD-L1 kit (cat # 64CUS000C-2) from Cisbio. Briefly, a 384-well white microplate was prepared by adding 2. mu.l of diluent or target compound diluted with diluent to each well, adding 4. mu.l of PD-1 protein and 4. mu.l of PD-L1 protein to each well, incubating at room temperature for 15min, and adding 10. mu.l of anti-Tag1-Eu3 to each well <sup>+</sup> And the mixed solution of anti-Tag2-XL665, and after 1-4 h of room temperature incubation, fluorescence signals at 665nm and 620nm are detected by an Envison instrument. HTRF rate (665nm/620nm) 10 <sup>4</sup> . 8-10 concentrations were assayed for each compound and IC was calculated using Graphpad software <sub>50</sub> . 3) The screening ",
    "using the surface plasmon resonance is called SPR angle. SPR biosensors provide a sensitive, real-time monitoring technique for the detection of molecular interactions that are not labeled. The sensor detects changes in the SPR angle, which in turn is related to the refractive index of the metal surface. When an analyte binds to the surface of the chip, the refractive index of the surface of the chip is changed, so that the SPR angle is changed, which is the basic principle of the SPR biosensor for detecting the intermolecular interaction in real time. Changes in SPR angle are recorded in real time on the sensorgram as the interaction is analyzed.</p><p id=\"p0306\" num=\"0299\">(2) The experimental method comprises the following steps:</p><p id=\"p0307\" num=\"0300\">capturing the PD-L1 protein on the Fc4 channel of the NTA chip by a capture method; the binding buffer was PBS-P +, pH7.4, 0.01% DMSO. The prepared compounds with a series of concentrations and the PD-L1 antibody were flowed across the chip surface for interaction assays.</p><p id=\"p0308\" num=\"0301\">(3) The experimental results are as follows:</p><p id=\"p0309\" num=\"0302\">TABLE 11 affinity of the compound of example 4 and the PD-L1 antibody for PD-L1</p><p id=\"p0310\" num=\"0303\"></p><p id=\"p0311\" num=\"0304\">The binding protein of example 4 was initially identified as PD-L1 (fig. 12). Further Biacore experiments were performed to confirm that example 4 has a strong binding ability to PD-L1 with an affinity of 2.025E-11 in kD, even stronger than the antibodies of PD-L1 (Table 11, FIGS. 12-14).</p></mode-for-invention></description>"
