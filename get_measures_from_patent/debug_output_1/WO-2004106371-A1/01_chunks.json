Full length Livin \u03b1 and Livin \u03b2 were detected as 39 and 37 kDa proteins (approximately), respectively. Treatment with staurosporine produced, in a time-dependent manner, detectable fragments of 30 kD and 28 kD, termed p30-Livin \u03b1 and p28-Livin \u03b2, respectively (Fig. la). No cleavage was detected after 12 hours without treatment. This difference in molecular weight represents the difference between full length Livin \u03b1 (39 kDa) and Livin \u03b2 (37 kDa), and suggests a common cleavage site for both isoforms. Concomitantly with the appearance of the cleavage fragments, a marked depletion of the full length of both Livin isoforms was observed (Fig. la). The smaller fragment, of approximately 10 kDa, could not be detected due to the use of a monoclonal antibody that is specific to an epitope located on the large (and detectable) fragments.</p>PARP (poly ADP ribose polymerase) is a nuclear protein involved in DNA repair predominantly in response to environmental stress. This protein is one of the main targets of caspase 3. Cleavage of PARP facilitates cellular disassembly and serves as a marker of cells undergoing apoptosis. Following exposure to anti-Livin antibody, the membrane was striped and exposed to</p>PARP antibody that detects full length PARP, as well as the large (89 kDa) and small (24 kDa) fragments. A clear correlation between the cleavage of</p>Livin and the cleavage of PARP as a marker of caspase 3 activity and apoptosis was noted (Fig lb). A decrease in PARP was observed after 12 hours of treatment, probably due to protein degradation, as a consequence of a high rate of apoptosis. \n\nTo further explore the cleavage of each isoform, retroviral infection to estabhsh a Jurkat T-"
