    "added to the supernatant to obtain 30% relative saturation and the precipitate allowed to form overnight with stirring at 4\u00b0 C. Following centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 30 min, the supernatant was taken and ammonium sulphate added to achieve 70% relative saturation. The solution was allowed to precipitate overnight and then centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 30 min in order to collect the precipitated protein fraction. The precipitated protein was resuspended in a minimal volume of extraction buffer and centrifuged once again (13,000 rpm\u00d730 min) to remove the undissolved portion. After dialysis (10 mM ethanolamine pH 9.0, 2 mM EDTA and 1 mM PMSF) to remove residual ammonium sulphate, the protein solution was passed through a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (5\u00d712 cm) previously equilibrated with 10 mM ethanolamine (pH 9), 2 mM in EDTA.</p>The collected flowthrough from this column represents the basic (pI&gt;9) protein fraction of the seeds. This fraction was further purified as described in Example 3.</p>EXAMPLE 2Anti-microbial Activity AssaysIn general, bioassays to assess antifungal and antibacterial activity were carried out in 96-well microtitre plates. Typically, the test organism was suspended in a synthetic growth medium consisting of K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4 </sub>(2.5 mM), MgSO<sub>4 </sub>(50 \u03bcM), CaCl<sub>2 </sub>(50 \u03bcM), FeSO<sub>4 </sub>(5 \u03bcM), CoCl<sub>2 </sub>(0.1 \u03bcM), CuSO<sub>4 </sub>(0.1 \u03bcM), Na<sub>2</sub>MoO<sub>4 </sub>(2 \u03bcM), H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3 </sub>(0.5 \u03bcM), KI (0.1 \u03bcM), ZnSO<sub>4 </sub>(0.5 \u03bcM), MnSO<sub>4 </sub>(0.1 \u03bcM), glucose (10 g/l), asparagine (1 g/l), methionine (20 mg/l), myo-inositol (2 mg/l), biotin (0.2 mg/l), thiamine-HCl (1 mg/l) and pyridoxine-HCL (0.2 mg/l). The test organism consisted of bacterial cells, fungal spores (50,000 spores/ml) or fungal mycelial fragments (produced by blending a hyphal mass from a culture of the fungus to be tested and then filtering through a fine mesh to remove larger hyphal masses). Fifty microliters of the test organism suspended in medium was placed into each well of the microtitre plate. A further 50 \u03bcl of the test anti-microbial solution was added to appropriate wells. To deal with well-to-well variability in the bioassay, 4 replicates of each test solution were done. Sixteen wells from each 96-well plate were used as controls for comparison with the test solutions.</p>Unless otherwise stated, the test organism used was Phytophthora cryptogea and incubation was at 25\u00b0 C. for 48 hours. All fungi including yeast were grown at 25\u00b0 C. and E. coli was grown at 37\u00b0 C. Percent growth inhibition was measured by following the absorbance at 600 nm of growing cultures over various time intervals and is defined as 100 times the ratio of the average change in absorbance in the control wells minus the change in absorbance in the test well divided by the average change in absorbance at 600 nm for the control wells. (i.e. [(avg change in control wells\u2212change in test well)/(avg change in contro"
