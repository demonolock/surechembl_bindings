To this was added Pd/C (2.4 g, 20%) and hydrogenated under 2 Bars of pressure for 22 h. The reaction mixture was filtered through celite and filtrate concentrated under vacuum. To the solid was added EtOAc (200 mL), stirred for 20 h and filtered. The solid was dried under vacuum to give 6-(aminomethyl)-2,2-dimethyl-4H-1,3-benzodioxin-4-one acetate (6 g, 38%).

The reaction mixture was slowly heated to 40\u00b0C and added methylbromoacetate (104 g, 0.67 mol) with stirring and heated to 70\u00b0C for 4 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to rt, filtered off the solid and filtrate was diluted with water (1.5 L). The aqueous mixture was extracted with EtOAc (3 x 750 mL), washed with 2.5% aqueous NaOH solution (2 x 400 mL), water and dried. The solvent was removed under vacuum to give the title compound a slight yellow solid (112 g).</p>Step b) Formation of methyl {4-[(hydroxyimino)methyl]phenoxy}acetate<img id=\"ib0022\" path=\"imgb0022.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/93570016/EP/20100120/B1/000001/65/42/47/imgb0022.tif\"/></p>A solution of methyl-(4-formylphenoxy)acetate (100 g, 0.515 mol) in methanol (500 mL) was cooled to 0-5\u00b0C. To this was added a solution of hydroxylamine hydrochloride (54 g) and sodium acetate (64 g) in water (500 mL) drop-wise and stirred at rt for 6 h. The reaction mixture diluted with water and filtered off the solid. The solid was washed with water and dried under vacuum to give the title compound (80 g, 74%).</p>Step c) Formation oj methyl [4-(aminomethyl)phenoxy]acetate, acetate salt<img id=\"ib0023\" path=\"imgb0023.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/93570100/EP/20100120/B1/000001/65/42/47/imgb0023.tif\"/></p>To a solution of methyl {4-[(hydroxyimino)methyl]phenoxy}acetate (30 g, 0.14 mol) in methanol (650 mL) was added glacial acetic acid (6.8 g) an"
