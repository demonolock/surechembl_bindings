    " 3.5 (2H, d).\n</p>Example X412H-(1-Benzyl-1,3-dihydroisoindole)-2-acetonitrileThe title compound, m.p. 78-79\u00b0C (isopropanol), was prepared from 19.8g (56mM) of 1-(bromomethyl)-2-\u00ad(2-phenyl-1-bromoethyl)benzene, 7.8g (84mM) of amino acetonitrile hydrochloride and 23.4 ml (16.8mM) triethylamine by an analogous method to that described in Example X4.</p>\u00b9H - nmr \u03b4 (CDCl\u2083)7.4-7.1 (9H, m); 4.4 (1H, m); 4.3 (1H, dd); 4.05 (1H, dd); 3.5 (1H, d); 3.25 (2H, m); and 2.8 (1H, dd).\n</p>Demonstration of Effectiveness of Compounds(A) Reversal of Adrenaline-Exacerbated Glucose Intolerance in MiceCFLP female mice of about 25g were fasted for 24 hours prior to receiving water (10ml/kg) or compounds by oral gavage. Thirty minutes later, glucose (1 g/kg) and adrenaline (300 \u00b5g/kg) were injected subcutaneously. Blood samples for glucose analysis were taken serially from the tail of each mouse at 0, 30, 60 90 and 120 minutes after dosing glucose and the results are expressed below as the percentage reduction in the area under the blood glucose curve; the compound treated groups being compared to the water dosed control group. Six mice were used in each treatment group.\n<img id=\"ib0009\" path=\"imgb0009.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/175568893/EP/19880727/A1/000000/27/56/39/imgb0009.tif\"/></p>(B) \u03b1\u2082-Adrenoceptor BindingHuman platelet membranes were incubated with [\u00b3H] Rau\u00adwolscine (0.5-1.0 nM) for 30 minutes at 30\u00b0C with varying concentrates of the drug (0.1-10,000 nM). The binding assay was stopped by filtering and rinsing on GF/B glass fibre filters.\n<img id=\"ib0010\" path=\"imgb0010.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/175568894/EP/19880727/A1/000000/27/56/39/imgb0010.tif\"/></p>"
