{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) exhibit IC50 values for the 5-HT2A receptor in the range from 1 nM to lO \u03bcM.\nThe results of this study show that Example 2 and Example 4 are high affinity ligands for the 5-HT2A receptor subtype, with Kj values of 6 and 14, respectively (n=3).\nIC50 determinations are performed utilizing the same functional assay as described for primary screening (15 min antagonist compound pre-incubation), applying the compounds in the dose range of 3 nM to 10 \u03bcM.\nCHO cells expressing 5-HT2A receptors seeded in 384 well plates are pre-loaded with Fluo-4AM fluorescent dye and then incubated with compound (10 \u03bcM for primary screen) for 15 min.\nThe activity at 5-HT2C receptors was studied in a FLIPR based assay, measuring the effect of compounds on 10 nM 5-HT induced Ca2+-currents."}
