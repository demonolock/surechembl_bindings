Fluorescent intensity is recorded using a Fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR384, Molecular Devices) and inhibition of the peak response evoked by 5- HT (EC<sub>70</sub> concentration) is calculated. IC<sub>50</sub> determinations are performed utilizing the same functional assay as described for primary screening (15 min antagonist compound pre-incubation), applying the compounds in the dose range of 3 nM to 10 \u03bcM.</p>\n  In vitro receptor pharmacology - selectivity determinations The affinity constants of compounds were determined using recombinant human serotonin receptors stably expressed in fibroblast cell lines (CHO or HEK293), measuring \n\nthe ability of the compounds to displace radio-labelled tracers using scintillation proximity assays or filter binding assays. For 5-HT\u03b9g, 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptor binding studies <sup>3</sup>H-LSD was used as radio ligand, for 5-HT2A nd 5-HTg <sup>3</sup>H-5-HT was used as tracer, while the binding constant to 5-HTIA <sup>was</sup> determined using <sup>3</sup>H-8-OH-DPAT. The non- selective serotonin receptor antagonist mianserine was used as reference substance. The activity at 5-HT2C receptors was studied in a FLIPR based assay, measuring the effect of compounds on 10 nM 5-HT induced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-currents.</p>\n  Biology summary The calculation of the Kj values for the inhibitors was performed by use of Activity</p>\n  Base. The Ki value is calculated from IC<sub>50</sub> using the Cheng Prushoff equation (with reversible inhibition that follows the Michaelis-Menten equation): K; = IC50 (1+[S]/K<sub>m</sub>)</p>\n  [Cheng, Y.C.; Prushoff, W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973, 22, 3099-3108]. The compounds of formula (I) exhibit IC50 values for the 5-HT2A receptor in the range from 1 nM to lO \u03bcM. Seven 5-HT2A antagonist lead compounds were identified in FLIPR-based functional screening of the 5-HT2A receptor. Four of these compounds were tested in equilibrium displacement binding measurements. The results of this study show that Example 2 and Example 4 are high affinity ligands for the 5-HT2A receptor subtype, with Kj values of 6 and 14, respectively (n=3). Both these compounds appear to be at least 20 fold selective over five other serotonin receptors assayed (5-HT2C<sub>&gt;</sub> 5-HT2B<sub>*</sub> 5-HT A<sub>&gt;</sub> 5- HT6 and 5-HTJB). Furthermore, Example 2 and Example 4 appear highly selective \u03bbt 5- HT2A versus the 5-HT2C receptor in terms of efficacy. Reversibility of inhibition of the 5- HT2A response was demonstrated for all compounds tested. \n\n</p>\n  \n    <img id=\"imgf000037_0001\" path=\"imgf000037_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/4056302/WO/20050310/A1/002005/02/15/45/imgf000037_0001.tif\"/>\n  </p>\n  The table shows the selectivity of two example compounds for the 5-HT2A over other serotonin-binding receptors. \n</p>\n"
