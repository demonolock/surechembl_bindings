Myostatin activity ",
    " affinity is obtained by assessing the association and dissociation rate constants using a Biacore surface plasmon resonance system (Biacore, Inc.). A biosensor chip is activated for covalent coupling of the target. The target is then diluted and injected over the chip to obtain a signal in response units of immobilized material. Since the signal in resonance units (RU) is proportional to the mass of immobilized material, this represents a range of immobilized target densities on the matrix. Association and dissociation data are fit simultaneously in a global analysis to solve the net rate expression for a 1:1 bimolecular interaction, yielding best fit values for k<sub>on</sub>, k<sub>off </sub>and R<sub>max </sub>(maximal response at saturation). Equilibrium dissociation constants for binding, K<sub>D</sub>'s are calculated from SPR measurements as k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>.</p>In some embodiments, the anti-myostatin Adnectins of the invention exhibit a K<sub>D </sub>in the SPR affinity assay described in Example 6 of 500 nM or less, 400 nM or less, 300 nM or less, 200 nM or less, 150 nM or less, 100 nM or less, 90 nM or less, 80 nM or less, 70 nM or less, 60 nM or less, 50 nM or less, 40 nM or less, 30 nM or less, 20 nM or less, 15 nM or less, 10 nM or less, 5 nM or less, or 1 nM or less.

Preferably, the assays are high-throughput assays that allow for screening multiple candidate Adnectins simultaneously. In some embodiments, the antagonist effects of anti-myostatin Adnectins on myostatin activity can be determined in cell-based activin responsive element (ARE)-luciferase reporter assays, as described in Example 3. In certain embodiments, the anti-myostatin Adnectins of the invention decrease myostatin-induced ARE-luciferase activity by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90% or more relative to a control upon co-incubating myostatin with an anti-myostatin Adnectin prior to stimulating cells with the mixture. An exemplary control reaction involves treating cells with myostatin alone or myostatin preincubated with an excess of a benchmark myostatin inhibitor such as Human Activin RIIB Fc Chimera (R&amp;D Systems) or ActRIIb-Fc as described in Morrison et al. (Experimental Neurology 2009; 217:258-68).

In certain embodiments, the anti-myostatin Adnectins of the invention decrease myostatin-induced SMAD phosphorylation by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or at least 97% or more relative to a control upon co-incubating myostatin with an anti-myostatin Adnectin prior to stimulating the cells with the mixture. An exemplary control reaction involves treating cells with myostatin alone or myostatin preincubated with an excess of a benchmark myostatin inhibitor such as Human Activin RIIB Fc Chimera (R&amp;D Systems) or ActRIIb-Fc as described in Morrison et al. (Experimental Neurology 2009; 217:258-68).

For example, a rat spinal cord organotypic slice subjected to glutamate excitotoxicity is useful as a model system to test the effectiveness of anti-myostatin Adnectins in preventing motor neuron degeneration. Corse et al., Neurobiol. Dis. (1999) 6:335 346. For a discussion of in vitro systems for use in studying ALS, see, e.g., Bar, P. R., Eur. J. Pharmacol. (2000) 405:285 295; Silani et al., J. Neurol.

(2000) 5:3 13.</p>It should be understood that the assays described herein are exemplary, and that any method known in the art that can serve as a readout for myostatin activity are suitable for use for testing the myostatin antagonizing effects of the anti-myostatin Adnectins of the invention (e.g., real-time RT-PCR of mRNAs of SMAD target gene",
    "3\u2014Cell-Based Luciferase AssayA luciferase reporter plasmid, Activin-Responsive Element (ARE)-luc, was generated by ligating nine repeats of the ARE in tandem to the firefly luciferase reporter. The plasmid was transiently transfected into HepG2 cells. Plasmid pGL4.74[hRluc/TK] was co-transfected to normalize for transfection efficiency. 10,000 cells were plated per well in a 96-well plate. When a protein such as myostatin, activin, or BMP-11, is added to cells and binds to its cognate receptor, downstream SMAD signaling is triggered, leading to binding of a phosphorylated SMAD complex to the ARE. The amount of, e.g., myostatin, exposed to the cells is directly proportional to the amount of luciferase protein produced and, consequently, luciferase activity measured. When a myostatin antagonist (e.g., an anti-myostatin Adnectin) is added concurrently with myostatin to the cells, activation of the ARE decreases, leading to a decreased luciferase production and activity.</p>In this experiment, (1) Anti-myostatin Adnectin and myostatin, (2) anti-myostatin Adnectin and activin A, or (3) anti-myostatin Adnectin and BMP-11 were preincubated prior to addition to cells. Myostatin (R&amp;D Systems) was used at 10-500 pM, activin A (R&amp;D Systems) at 10-500 pM, and BMP-11 (R&amp;D Systems) at 10-500 pM. After overnight incubation with these various combinations, cells were lysed and luciferase activity (luminescence) measured using the Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System\u00ae (EnVision). The IC50 is defined as the concentration of Adnectin required to reach 50% inhibition of myostatin-induced ARE-luciferase activity.</p>As shown in Tables 8-10, anti-myostatin Adnectins inhibited myostatin-mediated increases in ARE-luc reporter activity.</p>Example 4\u2014HTRF Binding AssayAn HTRF assay was used to measure the binding affinities of anti-myostatin Adnectins to myostatin. The assay was a competitive HTRF assay using Eu-W1024 label as a donor fluorophore and Alexa Fluor\u00ae 647 as an acceptor fluorophore. The biotinylated Adnectin 1889E01 and Alexa Fluor\u00ae 647 labeled rhActRIIb-Fc can bind myostatin simultaneously at two distinct binding sites. The Eu-W1024 labeled Streptavidin is used to bind biotinylated 1889E01. The two fluorophores, Eu-W1024 and Alexa Fluor\u00ae 647, are brought together by the formation of a 1889E01/myostatin/ActRIIb-Fc complex, and the HTRF signal can be read on an EnVision platereader (Perkin Elmer) using an HTRF protocol. In the presence of a competitive Adnectin, the HTRF signal decreases. IC50s are presented in Tables 8-10.</p>TABLE 8Biophysical characterization, ARE-luciferase reporter assay, and HTRF bindingassay results for anti-myostatin mono-Adnectins.ARE-luciferase assayHTRFTm-Myo IC50BMP-11 IC50Activin A IC50Myo IC50IDTSFTm-DSC(nM)(nM)(nM)(nM)1979_B06480.113.3194ND2062_G02482051500&gt;1500ND2522_C09400.061.61000ND2523_G0649494.246&gt;2000ND2524_C11ND550.10.89765ND2524_D0954490.060.5584ND2524_E10ND0.095.6&gt;1000ND2524_H05400.097.3&gt;1000ND2524_H11490.036.2&gt;1000ND2525_B01ND0.113.273ND2525_D0258550.051.1345ND2525_D05ND690.113.9&gt;1000ND2525_F07460.133.4&gt;1000ND2987_A06500.1023283ND2987_B04480.123.3239ND2987_B09520.010.92172ND2987_C02500.067.1464ND2987_D05490.112.42000ND2987_E03510.102.3224ND2987_E08520.052.8352ND2987_F01490.056.5594ND2987_F06520.0820538ND2987_G04490.093.3171ND2987_G09540.050.91&gt;2000ND2987_H02510.0511794ND2987_H07570.025.5&gt;400ND3006_A10620.082.0&gt;20000.153007_B08570.060.234230.143007_C09630.040.894170.143007_C10660.031.0&gt;20000.143008_A03590.1122.6&gt;20000.223008_B08570.359.32540.373008_D04560.091.27200.143008_F01630.080.12&gt;20000.213008_G01570.030.31&gt;20000.113008_G03580.091.3&gt;20000.133115_D04640.163.6&gt;10000.203115_E06620.072.0&gt;10000.143116_A06640.1413&gt;10000.153116_A07600.040.5&gt;10000.113116_C01600.106.710000.353116_C06610.148.9&gt;10000.183116_H06600.101.6&gt;10000.133146_A08690.7048&gt;10000.26ATI-1267600.060.506440.12ATI-1275530.030.14190.19ATI-1277no0.141.1820000.38transitionATI-1340540.054.873240.16</p>TABLE 9Biophysical characterization, ARE-luciferase reporter assay, and HTRF bindingassay results for PEGylated anti-myostatin Adnectins.ARE-luciferase assayHTRFTm-Tm-% MonomerMyo IC50BMP-11Activin AMyo IC50IDTSFDSC(SEC)(nM)IC50 (nm)IC50 (nM)(nM)ATI-11061771414&gt;2000ATI-1107639819888&gt;2000NDATI-12666097.80.120.8920000.21ATI-12765694.60.080.151100.28ATI-12784693.70.271.1&gt;20000.54ATI-1338590.285.8&gt;10000.24ATI-1339610.286.0&gt;10000.28ATI-1341530.030.14140.13ATI-13595796.50.263.1&gt;10000.36ATI-137567&gt;990.171.6&gt;10000.76ATI-137670&gt;990.030.83&gt;10000.32ATI-137768&gt;990.050.78&gt;10000.15ATI-137874&gt;990.295.4&gt;10001.29ATI-137969&gt;990.104.3&gt;10000.28</p>TABLE 10Biophysical characterization, ARE-luciferase reporter assay, and HTRF bindingassay results for Fc-fused anti-myostatin Adnectins.ARE-luciferase assayHTRFTm-Tm-% MonomerMyo IC50BMP-11Activin AMyo IC50IDTSFDSC(SEC)(nM)IC50 (nm)IC50 (nM)(nM)PRD-9320.24NDNDNDPRD-11710.080.20190.14PRD-11730.020.1060.12PRD-1174Tm1 610.040.1040.09Tm2 67Tm3 83PRD-11750.100.28190.15PRD-11770.160.28210.64PRD-1178Tm1 600.080.25160.27Tm2 69Tm3 84PRD-1180Tm1 680.070.11140.13Tm2 83PRD-12840.020.04440.62PRD-1285Tm1 67970.050.032160.49Tm2 68Tm3 80PRD-1286Tm1 66990.100.11940.73Tm2 68Tm3 81PRD-12870.300.80&gt;10002.70PRD-1288Tm1 65930.080.10&gt;10000.47Tm2 69Tm3 81PRD-13010.060.06150.07PRD-13020.030.02140.12PRD-13030.020.033140.11PRD-13040.050.07450.24PRD-13050.060.071130.10PRD-1471Tm1 62990.160.16600.47Tm2 68Tm3 81PRD-1472Tm1 621000.070.0510000.41Tm2 69Tm3 80PRD-1473Tm1 631000.070.061250.73Tm2 69Tm3 81PRD-1474Tm1 631000.080.09&gt;10000.45Tm2 69Tm3 81</p>Example 5\u2014Anti-Myostatin Adnectin-Mediated Inhibition of Myostatin-Induced SMAD2 PhosphorylationHuman rhabdomyosarcoma RH41 cells (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) were used for the 12-, 2-, and 4-point inhibition response analysis described below. Cells were removed from culture medium and washed to remove serum and quiesced in assay media containing BSA for 4 hours. Cells were lifted off the flask using versene and transferred to 96-well, V-bottom polypropylene plates at 5\u00d710<sup>5 </sup>cells/well. For the 12-point inhibition response, 100 pM recombinant myostatin (R&amp;D Systems), preincubated for 1 hour with a 5-fold dilution concentration range of Adnectins starting at 1000 nM (i.e., 1000 nM, 200 nM, 40 nM, 8 nM, 1.6 nM, 0.32 nM, 0.064 nM, 0.0128 nM, 0.00256 nM, 0.000512 nM, 0.000102 nM, 0.0000204 nM), was added to the cells. For the 4-point inhibition response, 100 pM of myostatin, preincubated for 1 hour with a concentration range of Adnectins (30 nM, 3 nM, 0.1 nM or 0.001 nM), was added to the cells. For the 2-point inhibition response, 100 pM of myostatin, preincubated for 1 hour with a concentration range of Adnectins (10 nM or 0.5 nM), was added to the cells. Cells were treated with the myostatin-Adnectin mixture for 1 hour at 37\u00b0 C. to induce SMAD2 phosphorylation (pSmad2). Stimulation was stopped by placing the cells on ice and adding ice-cold PBS. Cells were pelleted and lysed following standard protocols and SMAD2 phosphorylation detected using an ELISA assay (Cell Signaling Technologies). The inhibition achieved by the concentration range of Adnectins was plotted using GraphPad Prism Software and normalizing data points to controls which gave 100% and 0% inhibition. The IC50 is defined as the concentration of Adnectin required to reach 50% inhibition of myostatin-induced SMAD2 phosphorylation. The data presented in Table 11 indicate that Adnectins derived from affinity optimization of parental clones 1979_B06 and 2062_G02 both potently and completely inhibited myostatin-induced pSMAD phosphorylation and demonstrated IC50 values ranging from 0.78 nM to 0.06 nM. This represents a greater than 16-75 fold improvement in IC50 values over the parental clones 1979_B06 (IC50=12.8 nM) and 2062_G02 (IC50=59.1 nM).</p>TABLE 11Inhibition of SMAD2 phosphorylation(pSMAD2) by anti-myostatin AdnectinspSmad2 AssayMyo IC50 (nM)Myo IC50 (nM)Myo % inhibitionID12-point4-pointat 10 nM1979_B0612.8 \u00b1 2.4\u2002(aka ATI-1133)2062_G0259.1 \u00b1 16.2(aka ATI-1134)2522_C090.132523_G060.782524_C110.142524_D090.112524_E100.132524_H050.132524_H110.112525_B010.142525_D020.362525_D050.202525_F070.273006_A10513007_B08973007_C09803007_C10763008_A03873008_B08903008_D04923008_F01863008_G01983008_G03913115_D040.063115_E060.063116_A060.273116_A070.063116_C010.263116_C060.733116_H060.063146_A080.78</p>Example 6\u2014SPR Affinity Measurements for Anti-Myostatin Adnectins Adnectin Binding Kinetics Using SPR Format AAnti-human Fe antibody (Biacore/GE) was immobilized on a Biacore CM5 chip via NHS/EDC coupling according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Quadruplicate titrations of PRD-1474 were performed with myostatin at a monomer concentration of 2 nM (n=2), 1 nM (n=1), and 0.7 nM (n=1). The relative unbound myostatin concentration was measured by capture on an ATI-1310 solid matrix (coupled to polyacrylamide beads via an engineered free cysteine) followed by detection with a fluorescent-labeled construct of the myostatin co-receptor, ActRIIB-Ig which can bind myostatin simultaneously with the Adnectin. ATI-1310 is a related Adnectin which competes with PRD-1474 for binding to myostatin and allows for capture of unbound myostatin. The global Kd analysis shown in Table 13 gives a Kd of 170 pM with a 95% confidence interval of 330-60 pM. The affinities of PRD-1177 and ATI-1338 were also measured using the same assay format. Triplicate titrations of PRD-1177 were performed with myostatin at a monomer concentration of 1 nM (n=2) and 0.8 nM (n=1). Triplicate titrations of ATI-1338 were performed with myostatin at a monomer concentration of 5 nM (n=1), 1.6 nM (n=1), and 1.4 nM (n=1). These analyses indicate that PRD-1177 binds myostatin with a global Kd value of 250 pM and a 95% confidence interval of 340-130 pM (Table 13). ATI-1338 binds myostatin with a global Kd value of 850 pM and a 95% confidence interval of 1400-330 pM.</p>TABLE 13KinExA solution phase affinitymeasurements for binding myostatin.95% confidenceinterval:AdnectinKdKd highKd lowPRD-1474170 pM330 pM\u200260 pMPRD-1177250 pM340 pM130 pMATI-1338850 pM1400 pM\u2002330 pM</p>Example 8\u2014Mutational Analysis of 3116_A06In order to understand the relative tolerance of loop positions to mutation, two similar but separate studies were conducted. The first was a traditional alanine scan, where the binding and efficacy of discrete alanine mutations in the loops of Adnectin 3116_A06 (SEQ ID NO: 118) were assessed in biochemical and cell-based assays. The second study consisted of deep mutational scanning in which we created a library of single-site mutations in the same positions of 3116_A06 (SEQ ID 118), but substituted each position with 20 of the possible amino acids. These library components were then expressed as protein-mRNA fusions and subjected to a single round of mRNA display (as described in Section IV), separating the library components associated with biotinylated myostatin from those remaining unbound using streptavidin magnetic beads. In this approach, next-generation sequencing of input and bound populations allowed for the determination of the relative enrichment/depletion of each sequence, reflecting its intrinsic affinity for myostatin.</p>Alanine Scanning: PCR site-directed mutagenesis was used to create single site alanine mutations in 3116_A06 (SEQ ID NO: 118) in the BC loop (residues 25-33), DE loop (residues 55-58), and FG loop (residues 80-89). Clones were expressed in E. coli and purified by HTPP as described in Example 1. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC, as described in Example 2) confirmed that all alanine-substituted proteins were predominantly monomeric (Table 14). Both ARE-luciferase (Example 3) and HTRF assays (Example 4) were conducted. In the HTRF competition binding assay, potencies ranged from IC50=1.5 nM to &gt;100 nM (Table 14). Most positions tolerated alanine substitution in the HTRF assay to some degree, with the exception of Gly55, Arg56, and Gly57 of the DE loop, for which binding was drastically reduced (IC50s&gt;100 nM). A lesser effect occurred in positions Gly30 of the BC loop, and Val80, Thr81, and Tyr88 of the FG loop, which still showed binding but with a &gt;10-fold increase in IC50 relative to the parental sequence (\u201cWT\u201d). In the ARE-luciferase cell-based assay, potency of mutants ranged from IC50=0.6 nM to &gt;100 nM (Table 14). The impact of alanine mutations was generally larger in the cell-based assay relative to the HTRF assay. Gly55, Arg56, and Gly57 of the DE loop and Val80 and Tyr88 of the FG loop all displayed drastically reduced potency in this assay, with IC50s&gt;100 nM. A more moderate effect was observed for BC positions Leu26, Pro27, His28, Gly30, and Asn33, and FG positions Thr81, Tyr85, and Leu86, which all had IC50s&gt;10-fold that of the parent sequence.</p>TABLE 14Biochemical characterization and cell-basedpotencies for alanine mutants of 3116_A06Myostatin HTRFMyostatin ARE-lucMutationSEC*IC50 (nM)IC50 (nM)WT parent10.30.6BCS25A10.82.9L26A12.316P27A11.010H28A10.86.2Q29A10.71.5G30A25.140K31A10.62.2N33A12.09.8DEG55A2&gt;100&gt;100R56A155&gt;100G57A1&gt;100&gt;100V58A21.63.3FGV80A14.0&gt;100T81A14.932D82A10.81.8T83A11.31.8G84A12.03.6Y85A12.05.5L86A21.412K87A10.82.0Y88A111&gt;100K89A10.71.6*SEC 1: Highly monomeric; SEC 2: Mostly monomeric</p>Deep Mutational Scanning: High throughput sequencing was combined with protein display to allow simultaneous measurement of the relative fitness of every possible single-site loop mutant, on a scale that would be onerous for a traditional approach like that described above (for review of \u201cDeep Mutational Scanning\u201d approaches, see Araya et al., Trends in Biotechnology 29: 435-442, 2011; a similar approach is further exemplified in Forsyth et al., mAbs 5: 523-532, 2013).</p>Library Construction and Selection: Three separate libraries were created that contained every possible single-site mutation in each of the three loops of 3116_A06 (SEQ ID NO: 118): BC loop (positions 25-33), DE loop (positions 55-58), and FG loop (positions 80-89). For each loop, multiple oligonucleotides were designed that individually incorporated an NNK codon at each position, where N=A, C, G, T and K=G, T. The use of these degenerate codons allow for the encoding of all 20 amino acids (plus a stop codon) at the position where the NNK is incorporated. The oligonucleotides were assembled via overlap extension PCR to generate the full-length Adnectin libraries, wher",
    "mple was sequenced by MiSeq 150 bp paired-end (Illumina) next-generation sequencing.</p>NGS data analysis: Forward-read sequences from next-generation sequencing were binned according to population, mutation position, and identity of the mutated amino acid. All sequences of poor quality and those containing multiple mutation sites were eliminated from the analysis. Next, the frequency of each sequence in the post-selection population was divided by its frequency in the input population to derive an enrichment ratio (ER). Comparison of ERs of the parental sequences (WT, which functions as a positive control) and sequences containing a stop codon (which function as a negative control, representing the background noise of survival by chance) showed that the ratio of signal to background (S/B) varied between the three loops, presumably because each loop library was put through selections individually. For this reason, every sequence was normalized to the average stop and average wt ERs for its own specific loop, to derive ER<sup>norm</sup>.</p>ERnorm=ER-ERstopERwt-ERstop</p>The deep mutational scan was validated by comparing the relative fitness of the single site alanine mutants to the biochemical data from the traditional alanine scan. Overall, the correlation was quite strong (FIG. 8). NGS ERs define a profile of enrichment and depletion of alanine mutants across the loops that correlates well with the impact observed in HTRF and ARE-luciferase assays.</p>The biochemical HTRF IC50 was also plotted directly versus the NGS ER<sup>norm </sup>for each alanine mutant, as shown in FIG. 9.</p>Based on the alanine correlations, three categories were established into which all single site amino acid mutations could be binned via their NGS enrichment ratios: Most preferable mutations (ER<sup>norm</sup>&gt;0.8), more preferable mutations (ER<sup>norm</sup>&gt;0.5), and preferable mutations (ER<sup>norm</sup>&gt;3 standard deviations from the loop average ER<sub>stop</sub>). The lower limits of ER<sup>norm </sup>defining the latter category differed for the three loops: BC=0.25; DE=0.15; FG=0.35. All single site mutants in the loops of 3116_A06 were binned according to their normalized enrichment ratios to determine the relative tolerance of each position to mutation (Table 15).</p>TABLE\u200315Single\u2003site\u2003mutations\u2003in\u2003the\u2003loop\u2003sequences\u2003of\u20033116_A06\u2003thatmaintain\u2003binding\u2003to\u2003myostatinMore\u2003PreferableMost\u2003PreferablePositionPreferable\u2003MutationsMutationsMutations25X<sub>51</sub>ACDFHIKLNQRSTVWYCFISVWYFSW 26X<sub>52</sub>LMVLL 27X<sub>53</sub>ACDEIKLMNPQRSTVYPP 28X<sub>54</sub>ACDEFGHIKLMNQRSTVWYCDEFGHIKLMNQRSTVWYCFGIKLMNRSTVWY 29X<sub>55</sub>ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWYACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVACEFHIKLMPQRSTVYWY 30X<sub>56</sub>GSGG 31X<sub>57</sub>ACDEFGHIKLMNQRSTVWYACGHIKLMNQRSVWYACHKLMNRVWY 32X<sub>58</sub>ACGLMSTAGLMSAGL 33X<sub>59</sub>ACFHNPQRSYCHNQSYHNQ 55GGG 56RRR 57GGG 58X<sub>60</sub>ACDEFIKLMNQSTVCEILMQTVCEILMV 80X<sub>61</sub>ACFILMQTVWYACILMVIV 81X<sub>62</sub>ACFGHIKLMNQRSTVWYCFHILMQRSTVWYCFILMTVWY 82X<sub>63</sub>ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWYACDEFGHILMNPQSTVWYACDEFGHILMNQSTV 83X<sub>64</sub>ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWYACDEFGHIKLMNQRSTVACDFGILMNQSTVWYWY 84X<sub>65</sub>ACDEFGHIKLMNQRSTVWYADEFGHILMNQSTVWYAGSTW 85X<sub>66</sub>ACFHILMNPSTVWYCFILMPTVWYFIVWY 86X<sub>67</sub>ACEFHIKLMNQRSTVWYCFHIKLMNQRTVWYFHILMVWY 87X<sub>68</sub>ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWYACEFGIKLMNPQRSTVWYACFGIKLMTVW 88X<sub>69</sub>FWYWYWY 89X<sub>70</sub>ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWYACDEGHKLMNPQRSTVAGKLMPQR</p>Using the full deep mutational scanning data, BC loop positions 25, 26, 27, 30, 32, and 33, DE loop positions 55, 56, and 57, and FG loop positions 80 and 88 appear to be the most conserved, where only a single or a few amino acid types at these positions maintain binding to myostatin.

Single dose studies of subcutaneous administration with these three PEGylated Adnectins were conducted in C57BL6 mice. Total drug concentrations were determined by ELISA assay. Bioanalytical PK immunoassay for the quantitation of ATI-1338 used a standard sandwich format ELISA assay, where the 1338 was captured with a monoclonal antibody to HIS-TAG protein, then detected with a polyclonal anti-PEG antibody. As shown in Table 16, the two 40 KD PEGylated formats, ATI-1338 and ATI-1339, provided more prominent pharmacokinetic enhancement (i.e., longer half life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) and higher dose-normalized exposure) than the Bis-20 KD PEGylated format, ATI-1341.</p>TABLE 16Pharmacokinetic Comparison of ThreePEGylated Formats for Adnectin 2987_H07PK ParametersATI-1338ATI-1339ATI-1341Dose (mg/kg)53.94Cmax/Dose547370113(nM/(mg/kg))Tmax (h)24244AUC/Dose32232.1(nM*hr/(mg/kg))t<sub>1/2 </sub>(h)253116</p>Single dose studies following intravenous and subcutaneous administration of Fc-fused anti-myostatin Adnectins (PRD-1177, PRD-1286, and PRD-1474) were conducted in C57BL6 mice to evaluate the effects of Fc-fusion on pharmacokinetic parameters.

As shown in Table 17, all three Fc-fused Adnectins had a longer half life (58-172 h) than the PEGylated Adnectin ATI-1338 (25 h). A lower SC bioavailability likely reflects proteolysis during interstitial and lymphatic transit of the biologic molecule.
