    "invention.</p>Example 1 construction of a CirA Gene knockout targeting fragment</p>Primers were designed based on the salmonella enteritidis genomic sequence (CP012347.1) published on NCBI.</p>Carrying out PCR amplification by using pKD3 plasmid as a template and using primers P1 and P2 to obtain a cirA gene knockout targeting fragment, wherein the total volume of a PCR reaction system is 50 mu l, 1 mu l of each of the primers P1 and P2, 2.5 mu l of dNTPs, 1 mu l of rTaq enzyme, 5 mu l of 10 xbuffer, 1 mu l of 100-fold diluted pKD3 plasmid and the balance of water;</p>the PCR reaction program is: pre-denaturation at 94 \u2103 for 5min, 25 cycles (94 \u2103 for 45s, 54 \u2103 for 30s, 72 \u2103 for 60s), and final extension at 72 \u2103 for 10 min; after the reaction is finished, agarose gel electrophoresis is carried out, a PCR product is recovered by using a gel recovery kit, and a band with the size of 1151bp is obtained; wherein, the primers P1 and P2 are:</p>P1\uff1a</p>5\u2019-AGCAAGATTTACAGCGCAGGCCCGTGCAAAACCTGAAAGATGTCCTGAAAGAGGTGCCGGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTCG-3\u2019\uff0cSEQ ID NO\uff1a1\uff1b</p>P2\uff1a</p>5\u2019-TGATACGTAGAATGACCAGTCTTCGAGCTGCGCCGGTTTCCAGTCCAGCGTACCGTTCGATGGGAATTAGCCATGGTCC-3\u2019\uff0cSEQ ID NO\uff1a2\uff1b</p>the primers P1 and P2 are respectively composed of a front part and a rear part, the underlined part at the 5 'end is homologous with the cirA sequence of the gene to be knocked out, and the underlined part at the 3' end is complementary with the sequences at both sides of the chloramphenicol resistance gene cat of the plasmid pKD 3.</p>Example 2 construction of Salmonella enteritidis cirA Gene-deleted Strain</p>Transferring the plasmid pKD46 into Salmonella enteritidis C50336 competent cells to obtain a C50336/pKD46 positive strain; preparing the positive strain C50336/pKD46 into competent cells; electrically transforming the cirA gene knockout targeting fragment obtained by amplification in example 1 into C50336/pKD46 competent cells, and replacing the cirA gene with chloramphenicol gene cat; wherein the step of electrotransformation is: uniformly mixing 1 mu l of the amplified and purified targeting fragments P1 and P2 with 50 mu l of electrotransformation competent cells, carrying out ice bath for 5-10min, transferring the mixture into a precooled electrotransfer cup, wiping off outer water drops, placing the mixture into a groove of an electrotransfer, adjusting the parameters of the electrotransfer to be 1.8KV, carrying out pulse of 25 mu F and resistance of 200 ohm, immediately transferring the transformation product into LB culture medium preheated at 37 \u2103 after electric shock is finished, carrying out shaking culture at 37 \u2103 for 1h, and coating the product on a nutrient agar plate containing chloramphenicol. After resistance screening and PCR identification by using specific identification primers P3 and P4, the reaction system of PCR amplification is 25 mu l, and comprises the following steps: primers P3 and P4 are 1 mul each, dNTPs are 2.5 mul, rTaq enzyme is 0.5 mul, 10 xbuffer is 2.5 m"
