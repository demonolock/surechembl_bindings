    "carded and replaced with fresh medium to continue culturing. After the cells grew all over, the cells were transferred to a culture flask. Puromycin was added at a final concentration of 3 \u03bcg/ml. After the culturing was continued for three days, the survived cells were the cells capable of regulating and expressing the mIL12bIL12aIL21FLT3L, which were named as B16(rtTA)-mIL12bIL12aIL21FLT3L.</p>28.3 Effect of Induced Expression of mIL12bIL12aIL21FLT3L on Tumor Growth</p>The cells B16(rtTA)-mIL12bIL12aIL21FLT3L in a logarithmic growth phase were digested, diluted with HBSS to 2\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml, and injected into the right backs of a total of 10 C57BL/6 female mice being 8-10 weeks old at 50 \u03bcl/mouse by using a 1 ml syringe. After tumors grew, the mice were fed with water containing 2 g/L doxycycline, and the survival of the mice was recorded. As shown in FIG. 45, the induced expression of mIL12bIL12aIL21FLT3L significantly improves the survival rate for the mice.</p>Example 29 Therapeutic Effect of Intratumoral Injection of mIL12bIL12aIL2GMCSF on Lung Cancer in Mice29.1 Preparation of mIL12bIL12aIL2GMCSF</p>The constructed mIL12bIL12aIL2GMCSF-expressing cells 293A-mIL12bIL12aIL2GMCSF were passaged to a 15 cm culture dish. After the cells grew all over, the medium was changed to 30 ml of CDM4HEK293, and the culturing was continued for 5 days. Then the supernatant was collected, filtered with a 0.45 urn filter, and then ultrafiltered and concentrated by 30 times with 50 kd AMICON ULTRA-15 to obtain 1 ml of a protein solution. Protein concentration was detected with an IL12p70 ELISA kit, and the protein was dispensed and stored at \u221220\u00b0 C.</p>29.2 Treatment of Tumor</p>The cultured mouse lung cancer cells (LLC) were digested, and 5\u00d710<sup>5 </sup>cells were subcutaneously injected into the right body sides of C57BL/6 mice. Treatment was started when the long diameter of each tumor reached about 5 mm.</p>3 ug of the protein was taken based on the protein concentration and diluted to 35 \u03bcl with sterile water. Then, 65 \u03bcl of glycerin was added, and mixed well under the careful blowing of a pipette tip. A prepared protein solution was sucked by using a 29G insulin syringe, and slowly injected into a tumor. After the injection, a needle was retained for a while to reduce the overflow of the solution. After the injection, the mice were returned to a cage, and the survival of the mice was recorded. The mice injected only with 65% glycerol were used as controls.</p>The experimental results are shown in FIG. 46. The treatment with mIL12bIL12aIL2GMCSF significantly improves the survival rate of mice.</p>Example 30 Construction of Cells Expressing hIL12bIL12aIL2GMCSF, hIL12bIL12aIL7GMCSF, hIL12bIL12aIL15GMCSF, hIL12bIL12aIL21GMCSF, hIL12bIL12aIL2FLT3L, hIL12bIL12aIL7FLT3L, hIL12bIL12aIL15FLT3L, and hIL12bIL12aIL21FLT3LIn the EP tube, enzyme digestion was performed on the pLentis-CMV-MCS-IRES-PURO vector, with a system as follows: 2 \u03bcg of plasmid, 3 \u03bcl of"
