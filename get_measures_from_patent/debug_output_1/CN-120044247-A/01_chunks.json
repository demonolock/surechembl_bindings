Thus, for example, unless indicated otherwise or clear from context, the term may refer to a 1:1 interaction between a polypeptide and its target. Binding affinity can be quantified by measuring the equilibrium dissociation constant (K <sub>D</sub>), K <sub>D</sub> refers to the dissociation rate constant (K <sub>d</sub>, time <sup>-1</sup>) divided by the association rate constant (K <sub>a</sub>, time <sup>-1</sup>M<sup>-1</sup>).K<sub>D</sub> can be determined by, for example, measuring complex formation and dissociation kinetics using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) methods, such as the Biacore <sup>TM</sup> system, kinetic exclusion assays, such asInterference with biological film layers (e.g. usingA platform). As used herein, \"binding affinity\" includes not only formal binding affinity, e.g., binding affinity reflecting a 1:1 interaction between a polypeptide and its target, but also calculating the apparent affinity of K <sub>D</sub> that can reflect affinity binding (avid binding).</p>The term \"specifically binds\" or \"selectively binds\" to a target such as TfR, as used herein, when referring to an engineered TfR binding polypeptide, tfR binding peptide, or TfR binding antibody as described herein, refers to a binding reaction in which the engineered TfR binding polypeptide, tfR binding peptide, or TfR binding antibody binds to the target with greater affinity, greater avidity, and/or longer duration than it binds to a structurally different target.

The terms \"specifically bind\", \"specifically bind to\" or \"have specificity for\" a particular target (e.g., tfR), as used herein, may be exhibited, for example, by a molecule having an equilibrium dissociation constant K <sub>D</sub> for the bound target of, for example, 10 <sup>-4</sup> M or less, for example, 10 <sup>-5</sup>M\u300110<sup>-</sup><sup>6</sup>M\u300110<sup>-7</sup>M\u300110<sup>-8</sup>M\u300110<sup>-9</sup>M\u300110<sup>-10</sup>M\u300110<sup>-11</sup> M or 10 <sup>-12</sup> M. In some embodiments, the engineered TfR binding polypeptide, tfR binding peptide, or TfR binding antibody specifically binds to an epitope on TfR that is conserved between species (e.g., structurally conserved between species), e.g., conserved between non-human primate and human species (e.g., structurally conserved between non-human primate and human species). In some embodiments, the engineered TfR binding polypeptide, tfR binding peptide, or TfR binding antibody may bind only human TfR.</p>The term \"variable region\" or \"variable domain\" refers to a domain in an antibody heavy or light chain that derives from a germline variable (V) gene, a diversity (D) gene, or a junction (J) gene (rather than from constant (c\u03bc and c\u03b4) gene segments) and confers specificity for binding of the antibody to an antigen. Typically, the antibody variable region comprises four conserved \"framework\" regions interspersed with three hypervariable \"complementarity determining regions\".</p>The terms \"antigen-binding portion\" and \"antigen-binding fragment\" are used interchangeably herein and refer to one or more fragments of an antibody that retain the ability to specifically bind an antigen through its variable region. Examples of antigen binding fragments include, but are not limited to, fab fragments (monovalent fragments consisting of VL, VH, CL, and CH1 domains), F (ab') <sub>2</sub> fragments (bivalent fragments comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge of a hinge region), single chain Fv (scFv), disulfide-linked Fv (dsFv), complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs), VL (light chain variable region), and VH (heavy chain variable region).</p>The following examples are intended to be non-limiting.</p>Example 1.

The 2 month old littermate TfR <sup>mu/hu</sup> mice were injected intravenously with saline once a week for 4 weeks (n=5), which served as a control. For the 7 day cohort, animals were sacrificed 7 days after the first day of dosing. For the 28 day cohort, animals were sacrificed 7 days after the fourth administration of weekly dosing.</p>To collect the final samples, animals were deeply anesthetized by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of Avertin% at 2.5%. To collect CSF, a sagittal incision was made in the back of the animal's skull, subcutaneous tissue and muscle were separated to expose the occipital sump, and the occipital sump was pierced using pre-tensioned glass capillaries to collect CSF. CSF was transferred to low protein LoBind Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 12,700rpm for 10 minutes at 4 \u2103. CSF was transferred to a new tube and quick frozen on dry ice. By measuring the absorbance of the sample at 420nm, it was confirmed that there was no bl",

Lysates were then transferred to clean 96-well deep plates and BCAs were performed to quantify total protein. Samples were stored at-80 \u2103 until assay use.</p>For Trem2 analysis in brain tissue and soluble Trem2 (sTrem 2) analysis in CSF, MSD GOLD 96w small spot streptavidin plates (MSD L45 SA) were prepared for Trem2 assay by coating overnight with 1ug/mL biotinylated sheep anti-mouse antibody (R &amp; D Systems BAF 1729) at 4 \u2103. The next day, MSD plates were rinsed with Tris Buffered Saline (TBST) containing triton and blocked for two hours with TBST containing 3% bovine serum albumin while shaking at 600 rpm. The MSD plates were again rinsed with TBST and the brain lysate was diluted 5-fold in blocking solution and then added to the MSD plates and incubated at 600rpm for 1 hour. After the next TBST rinse, sulfo-labeled sheep anti-mouse antibody (R &amp; D SYSTEMS AF 1729) was added to the plate and incubated again at 600rpm for 1 hour and a final rinse was performed, followed by addition of 2XMSD read buffer diluted in water. The plate was then read using MSD Meso Sector S a 600. Trem2 signal was normalized to protein concentration and plotted with GRAPHPAD PRISM.</p>Abbreviations (abbreviations)</p>Bmp=bis (monoacylglycerol) phosphate; ETV: ids=enzyme transporter: iduronate 2-sulfatase; glccer=glucosylceramide; galcer=galactosyl ceramide; ids=iduronate 2-sulfatase; ki=knock-in; ko=knock-out; tfR <sup>mu/hu</sup> =chimeric human/mouse transferrin receptor.</p>Results</p>To determine whether the strong GAG reduction observed in the brain translates into correction of downstream disease-related pathology, the ability of ETV: IDS to correct secondary lysosomal storage was assessed. An active equivalent dose of ETV IDS or Ai Duliu enzyme was administered intravenously to IDS KO; tfR <sup>mu/hu</sup> KI mice once a week for four weeks, and the levels of a panel of lysosomal lipids, including gangliosides, glucosylceramides, and bis (monoacylglycerol) phosphate, were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS). A large accumulation of lysosomal lipids was observed in the brain of IDS KO; tfR <sup>mu/hu</sup> KI mice compared to the wild-type control. After administration of 40mg/kg once a week for four weeks, ETV: IDS was very effective in lowering lysosomal lipids in the brain, completely reducing the levels of these lipids to those seen in wild type mice. However, treatment with an active equivalent dose of Ai Duliu enzyme did not reduce the levels of these lysosomal lipids in the brain. Together, these data demonstrate that ETV IDS can effectively correct secondary lysosomal storage in addition to the proximal effect on GAG accumulation.</p>Specifically, figures 5A-5B show that peripheral administration of IDS (4 weeks treatment) corrected brain (figure 5A) and CSF GAG accumulation in IDS KO mice. When ETV: IDS was administered peripherally, brain GAG was reduced by 58% compared to a 14% reduction at Elaprase of the active equivalent dose. Furthermore, 66% reduction in CSF GAG was observed when ETV: IDS was administered peripherally (one outlier of ETV: IDS group omitted) compared to 27% reduction at Elaprase of the active equivalent dose. Fig. 14A-14B show the reduction of individual GAG species (D00S 0, D00a 4) in brain and CSF. In a subsequent study, the dose of ETV: IDS was 40mg/kg, and the CSF GAG was three times less than that of WT.</p>Figure 6 shows that peripheral administration of IDS (4 weeks treatment) corrected lysosomal lipid (ganglioside) accumulation in IDS KO brain.</p>Figures 7A-7B show ETV peripheral administration of IDS (4 weeks treatment) corrected lysosomal lipid (GlcCer) accumulation in IDS KO brain. Correction of brain GlcCer accumulation was observed with peripheral administration of ETV: IDS, whereas no change in galactosylceramide (GalCer) was observed.</p>Figure 8 shows ETV: peripheral administration of IDS (4 weeks treatment) corrected lysosomal lipid (BMP) accumulation in IDS KO brain.</p>Figure 9 shows a heat map showing lipid levels in the brain of IDS KO mice treated with vehicle, ETV: IDS or Elaprase (Ai Duliu enzyme). This heat map is generated using the modified data of table 2. Specifically, the data in table 2 was modified using a cutoff value to convert a value between 0.9 and 1.1 to 1 to show a difference of greater than 10%.</p>Figure 10 shows that peripheral administration of ETV: IDS corrected TREM2 accumulation in IDS KO brain.</p>FIG. 11 shows that an increase in CSF sTrem2 levels was observed in IDS KO; tfR <sup>mu/hu</sup> KI mice relative to TfR <sup>mu/hu</sup> KI mice cohorts.

Tissues were sampled and lipid and GAG levels were measured using the methods described herein (example 1). Nf-L levels were measured as follows.</p>Methods for CSF and serum analysis of Nf-L</p>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was diluted 100-fold using Quanterix Simoa neurofilament light chain (NF-L) sample dilution (Quanterix 102252) and serum was diluted 4-fold before addition to Simoa 96 well microplates (Quanterix 101457). NF-light assays were performed using Simoa detection reagents and microbead reagents (Quanterix 103159 and 102246, respectively) according to the instructions of the Simoa NF-LIGHT ADVANTAGE kit (Quanterix 1031086). After incubation of the samples with the detection agent and microbead reagent for 30 minutes at 30 \u2103 at 800rpm, the sample plates were washed with Simoa wash buffer a (Quanterix 103078) on a Simoa microplate ",
    "k frozen on dry ice. Animals were transcardiac perfused with ice-cold PBS using peristaltic pumps (Gilson company Minipuls Evolution). Brains were dissected and quick frozen on dry ice.</p>CNS cell type isolation</p>CNS cells were sorted as described to achieve pure astrocyte, microglial and neuronal populations (example 4). The sorted cell pellet is pelleted or directly collected into lysis buffer and then processed for downstream analysis, including qRT-PCR, RNAseq or glycomics, as described in the related methods. Cell number was used to calculate pg GAG/cell.</p>Cell lysate preparation and LCMS assays for measuring GAGs, BMP, gangliosides, glcCer, and GalCer were performed using methods similar to those described in example 1.</p>Analysis of distribution of IDS throughout CNS cell types</p>Live cells in sheath fluid (about 1.5 ml) were sorted directly into 150 \u03bcl of 5% CHAPS lysis buffer with a final CHAPS concentration of 0.5%. The samples were concentrated using an Amicon Ultra 30kDa filter. Five (5) \u03bcl samples or recombinant ETV IDS serial dilutions were performed using IgG (human) AlphaLISA detection kit (perkinelmer#al205C) according to the manufacturer's instructions and read on an EnVision <sup>TM</sup> plate reader. Sample concentrations were interpolated from standard curves generated using ETV: IDS and normalized to total cell input number.</p>Results</p>The specific distribution and efficacy of the cell types of IDS in the brain of IDS KO; tfR <sup>mu/hu</sup> KI mice was evaluated.</p>GAG levels in the enriched CNS cell populations were quantified by LC-MS/MS as described. Fig. 18A shows elevated GAG levels in microglia, astrocytes and neurons isolated from IDS KO; tfR <sup>mu/hu</sup> KI mice relative to TfR <sup>mu/hu</sup> KI controls, demonstrating substrate accumulation for all three CNS cell types when IDS expression was knocked out (n=3-5 mice per group). IDS KO, tfR <sup>mu/hu</sup> KI mice (n=4 mice per group) were given 40mg/kg ETV intravenously, IDS, and enzyme concentrations in the whole CNS cell population were assessed two hours after dosing. Figure 18B shows that significant accumulation of ETV: IDS was observed in neurons, astrocytes and microglia, demonstrating that ETV: IDS was effectively distributed to the brain parenchyma and absorbed by critical CNS cell types. All data are shown as mean \u00b1 SEM, unpaired student t-test p.ltoreq.0.05, 0.001.</p>Next, IDS KO; tfR <sup>mu/hu</sup> KI mice were given intravenously with 40mg/kg ETV: IDS once a week for four weeks, and the ability of ETV: IDS to reduce GAG accumulation in all three CNS cell types was assessed using LC-MS/MS. Figure 19 shows that IDS treatment reduced GAG levels in neurons, astrocytes and microglia to levels comparable to those seen in wild-type mice after repeated administration. Data are shown as mean \u00b1 SEM, one-way ANOVA with graph base multiple comparison test. The data demonstrate ETV: IDS is capable of delivering IDS to brain cells through the brain endothelium, and that this delivery is sufficient to function in critical CNS cell types.</p>ETV IDS treatment also reduced secondary accumulation of lysosomal lipids in CNS cell types of interest (e.g., neurons, astrocytes, microglia), including gangliosides (fig. 20), glucosylceramides (fig. 21), and bis (monoacylglycerol) phosphate (BMP) (fig. 22). These data demonstrate that IDS treatment with ETV can correct secondary lysosomal dysfunction in addition to primary GAG storage in CNS cell types.</p>Example 6 spatial distribution of accumulated lipid Material and ETV: correction of lipid accumulation by IDS</p>The effect of IDS on spatial distribution of lysosomal lipids and microglial activation in IDS ko\u00d7tfr <sup>muhu</sup> mice was examined for varying doses of ETV.</p>Mouse strains and administration</p>TfR <sup>mu/hu</sup> mice and IDS ko\u00d7tfr <sup>mu/hu</sup> mice used in this study are described in example 1 above.

    "l treatment for immunohistochemistry. Sections were washed 3 times in 1 XPBS for 5 minutes each and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes. The sections were then washed 3 times in 1 XPBS for 5 minutes each and then incubated in blocking solution (1 XPBS/5% goat serum/0.3% Triton X-100) for 1 hour at room temperature. Sections were then incubated in primary antibodies prepared in blocking solution (BioRad: rat anti-Cd 68, 1:500) for 2 hours at room temperature. Sections were washed 3 times in 1 XPBS/0.3% Triton X-100 for 5 minutes each and then incubated in blocking solution (Invitrogen: goat anti-rat Alexa Fluor 488, 1:500) and DAPI (Invitrogen Molecular Probes D1306:1306: from 5mg/mL stock solution, 1:10,000) for 1 hour at room temperature in the dark. The sections were then rinsed 3 times in 1 XPBS/0.3% Triton X-100 for 5 minutes each, rinsed rapidly in 1 XPBS, and then covered with polyvinyl alcohol mounting medium (Sigma 10981) with DABCO anti-fade agent. Fluorescent images were taken at 20 x magnification using Zeiss Axio Scan Z a 1. Each fluorophore was imaged separately using a suitable single channel filter set, with the exposure time of each fluorophore being the same in all tissue samples imaged. The individual images are then tiled and stitched using Zeiss Zen software and shading corrected.</p>Results</p>Mass spectrometry Imaging (IMS) was performed to determine the spatial distribution of lipid accumulation in the brain of IDS KO; tfR <sup>mu/hu</sup> KI mice and to evaluate whether ETV: IDS administration was able to correct lysosomal lipid accumulation throughout the brain. MALDI MS images were obtained from wild type and IDS KO, tfR <sup>mu/hu</sup> KI mice coronal brain sections after administration of vehicle, ai Duliu enzyme or ETV: IDS for four weeks once a week. Representative images of selected gangliosides are shown in figure 23. The middle plot shows the signal distribution at m/z 1382.816, corresponding to GM2 (d36:1), while the bottom plot shows the signal distribution at m/z 1179.738, corresponding to GM3 (d36:1). The image depicts the relative intensity of each signal from 0-100%.</p>As shown in fig. 23, enrichment of several gangliosides species in the brain of IDS KO; tfR <sup>mu/hu</sup> KI mice was observed compared to wild type controls. This is similar to the results observed in the analysis of homogenized tissue (fig. 6). Ganglioside accumulation is regiospecific and concentrated in hypothalamic and amygdala brain regions. ETV was administered once and for four weeks weekly IDS reduced the accumulation of these gangliosides in the entire brain area, assessed at levels identical to those seen in wild-type mice, whereas only slight ganglioside reduction was observed under Ai Duliu enzyme treatment. Taken together, these data indicate that ETV: IDS can correct lysosomal dysfunction downstream of GAG accumulation in the CNS.</p>Neuroinflammation represents a common feature of many neuropathic LSDs and a consensus has emerged that glial activation, commonly reported in mouse models of MPS II disease and MPS patients, may lead to progressive degeneration throughout the brain in MPS disorders. The levels of two markers of microglial activity, CD68 and trigger receptor 2 (Trem 2) expressed on myeloid cells, were assessed by immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissue sections or biochemical analysis of brain lysates, respectively. FIG. 24 is a representative image of immunofluorescent staining of DAPI and CD68 from brains of TfR <sup>mu/hu</sup> KI and IDS KO, tfR <sup>mu/hu</sup> KI mice treated with vehicle, ETV: IDS or Ai Duliu enzyme. Magnification was 20 times, and images represent hippocampus (top), cortex (middle), and striatum (bottom). Fig. 10 shows the levels of Trem2 in treated mice.</p>The levels of both CD68 and Trem2 were elevated in the brain of TfR <sup>mu/hu</sup> KI mice compared to the TfR <sup>mu/hu</sup> KI control (FIGS. 10, 24). The administration of 40mg/kg ETV once a week for four weeks was effective for IDS to reduce CD68 signaling throughout the brain of IDS KO; tfR <sup>mu/hu</sup> KI mice (FIG. 21). After repeated systemic administration of ETV: IDS, the levels of Trem2 in the brain were completely reduced to the levels seen in wild-type mice (fig. 10). However, the administration of an active equivalent dose of Ai Duliu enzyme for four weeks once a week failed to reduce the levels of CD68 and Trem 2. Administration of ETV: IDS also reduced accumulation of soluble Trem2 (sTrem 2) in CSF of treated IDS KO; tfR <sup>mu/hu</sup> KI mice (fig. 11). These data indicate that ETV, IDS can attenuate microglial activity in addition to GAG and secondary lysosomal lipid accumulation in the brain.</p>Example 7 construction of fusion proteins comprising IDS.</p>Design and cloning</p>IDS-Fc fusion proteins were designed that contained (i) a fusion polypeptide that fused mature human IDS enzyme to a human IgG1 fragment comprising an Fc region (\"IDS-Fc fusion polypeptide\"), and (ii) a modified human IgG1 fragment that contained a mutation in the Fc region that confers transferrin receptor (TfR) (\"modified Fc polypeptide\"). Specifically, IDS-Fc fusion polypeptides were created in which IDS fragments were fused to the N-terminus or C-terminus of a human IgG1 Fc region. In some cases, linkers are placed between IDS and IgG1 fragments to mitigate any steric hindrance between the two fragments. In all constructs, the signal peptide from kappa chain V-III, amino acids 1-20 (UniProtKB ID-P01661) was inserted upstream of the fusion to promote secretion, and IDS was truncated, consisting of amino acid S26-P550 (UniProtKB ID-P22304). The fragment of the human IgG1 Fc region used corresponds to amino acids D104-K330 (positions 221-447, EU numbering, including 10 amino acids of the hinge (positions 221-230)) of the sequence in UniProtKB ID P01857. In some embodiments, a second Fc polypeptide derived from human IgG1 residues D104-K330 but lacking the IDS fusion is co-transfected with an IDS-Fc fusion polypeptide to produce a ",
    "d supernatant was dialyzed thoroughly against 15L 20mM HEPES pH 7.4 containing 100mM NaCl overnight. The dialyzed supernatant was bound to a HisTrap column (GE HEALTHCARE LIFE SCIENCES, using Akta Pure system). After binding, the column was washed with 20 CV PBS. Bound protein was eluted using PBS containing 500mM imidazole. Homogeneity of IDS enzyme in eluted fractions was assessed by reducing and non-reducing SDS-PAGE. Pooled fractions containing IDS enzyme were diluted 1:10 in 50mM Tris pH 7.5 and further purified using Q Sepharose High Performance (GE HEALTHCARE). After binding, the column was washed with 10CV of 50mM Tris pH 7.5. Bound proteins were eluted using a linear gradient to 50mM Tris pH 7.5 and 0.5M NaCl and collected in the 1CV fraction. The purity of the fractions was assessed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE. Purification produced a homogeneous IDS-Fc fusion protein and an IDS enzyme with a hexahistidine tag (SEQ ID NO: 203).</p>Example 8 peripheral administration of ETV IDS effect on GAG and neurofilament light chain (Nf-L) in IDS KO\u00d7TfR <sup>muhu</sup> mice</p>The effect of IDS on GAG and neurofilament light chain (Nf-L) in IDS KO\u00d7TfR <sup>muhu</sup> mice was examined once weekly intravenous administration of ETV.</p>Materials and methods</p>Animal care</p>Mice were housed under 12 hours light/dark cycle and were given water ad libitum and a standard rodent diet @#25502, Irradiation).</p>Mouse strain</p>The IDS ko\u00d7tfr <sup>mu/hu</sup> mice and TfR <sup>mu/hu</sup> KI mice used in this study are described in example 1 above.
