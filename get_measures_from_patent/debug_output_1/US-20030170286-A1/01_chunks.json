    "eof, including a first constituent moiety and a second constituent moiety; and </p>[0078] b) a linkage covalently linking said at least two constituent moieties to form said codrug, said linkage is cleaved under physiological conditions to regenerate said constituent moieties; </p>[0079] wherein the device is dimensioned to position two radiation seeds a predetermined distance apart. </p>[0080] In certain embodiments, the polymer matrix is non-bioerodible, while in other embodiments it is bioerodible. Exemplary non-bioerodible polymer matrices can be formed from polyhema, polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), polyhydroxyvalerate (PHV), polycaprolactone, polyanhydrides, polyorthoesters, polyaminoacids (and \u201cpseudo\u201d polyaminoacids), polycyanoacrylates, polyphosphazenes, polyurethane, polysilicone, poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate), polyvinyl alcohol, and derivatives and copolymers thereof. </p>[0081] Exemplary bioerodible polymer matrices can be formed from collagen, polyanhydride, polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, polyorthoester, polyalkylcyanoacrylate, and derivatives and copolymers thereof. </p>[0082] In certain embodiments, the polymer matrix is chosen so as reduce interaction between the prodrug in the matrix and proteinaceous components in surrounding bathing fluid, e.g., by forming a matrix having physical (pore size, etc.) and/or chemical (ionized groups, hydrophobicity, etc.) characteristics which exclude proteins from the inner matrix, e.g., exclude proteins of greater than 100 kD, and even more preferably exclude proteins greater in size than 50 kD, 25 kD, 10 kD, or even 5 kD. </p>[0083] In certain embodiments, the polymer matrix is essentially non-release-rate-limiting with respect to the rate of release of a constituent moiety from the matrix. </p>[0084] In other embodiments, the subject polymer matrices influence the rate of release. For instance, the matrices can be derived to have charge or hydrophobicity characteristics which favor sequestration of the codrug over the constituent moieties. Likewise, the polymer matrix can influence the pH-dependency of the hydrolysis reaction, or create a microenvironment having a pH different than the bathing bodily fluid, such that hydrolysis, stability, and/or solubility of the prodrug or codrug is different within the matrix than in the surrounding fluids. In such a manner, the polymer can influence the rate of release and the rate of hydrolysis of the prodrug or codrug, by differential electronic, hydrophobic or chemical interactions with the prodrug or codrug. </p>[0085] In many preferred embodiments, the duration of release from the polymer matrix of a therapeutically effective amount of a constituent moiety is at least 24 hours, and even more preferably may be at least 72 hours, 100, 250, 500 or even 750 hours. In certain embodiments, the duration of release of a constituent moiety from the polymer matrix is at least one week, more preferably two weeks, or even more preferably at least three weeks. In certain embodiments, the duration of release of a constituent moiety from the polymer matrix is a"
