    "ns. Together, these types of ion channels generate, maintain, and utilize an electrochemical gradient that is used in 1) electrical impulse conduction down the axon of a nerve cell, 2) transport of molecules into cells against concentration gradients, 3) initiation of muscle contraction, and 4) endocrine cell secretion. Ion Transporters</p>Ion transporters generate and maintain the resting electrical potential of a cell. Utilizing the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis, they transport ions against the ion's concentration gradient. \n\nThese transmembrane ATPases are divided into three families. The phosphorylated (P) class ion transporters, including Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> ATPase, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase, and H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, are activated by a phosphorylation event. P-class ion transporters are responsible for maintaining resting potential distributions such that cytosolic concentrations of Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> are low and cytosolic concentration of K<sup>+</sup> is high. The vacuolar (V) class of ion transporters includes H<sup>+</sup> pumps on intracellular organelles, such as lysosomes and Golgi. V-class ion transporters are responsible for generating the low pH within the lumen of these organelles that is required for function. The coupling factor (F) class consists of H<sup>+</sup> pumps in the mitochondria. F-class ion transporters utilize a proton gradient to generate ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (P,). The P-ATPases are hexamers of a 100 kD subunit with ten transmembrane domains and several large cytoplasmic regions that may play a role in ion binding (Scarborough, G.A. (1999) Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 11 :517-522). The V-ATPases are composed of two functional domains: the V, domain, a peripheral complex responsible for ATP hydrolysis; and the V<sub>0</sub> domain, an integral complex responsible for proton translocation across the membrane. The F- ATPases are structurally and evolutionarily related to the V-ATPases. The F- ATPase F<sub>0</sub> domain contains 12 copies of the c subunit, a highly hydrophobic protein composed of two transmembrane domains and containing a single buried carboxyl group in TM2 that is essential for proton transport. The V- ATPase V<sub>0</sub> domain contains three types of homologous c subunits with four or five transmembrane domains and the essential carboxyl group in TM4 or TM3. Both types of complex also contain a single a subunit that may be involved in regulating the pH dependence of activity (Forgac, M. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274:12951-12954).</p>The resting potential of the cell is utilized in many processes involving carrier proteins and gated ion channels. Canier proteins utilize the resting potential to transport molecules into and out of the cell. Amino acid and glucose transport into many cells is linked to sodium ion co-transport (symport) so that the movement of Na<sup>+</sup> down an electrochemical gradient drives transport of the other molecule up a concentration gra",
    "gests that the gene of interest is also present, the presence and expression of the gene may need to be confirmed. For example, if the sequence encoding TRICH is inserted within a marker gene sequence, transfonned cells containing sequences encoding TRICH can be identified by the absence of marker gene function. Alternatively, a marker gene can be placed in tandem with a sequence encoding TRICH under the control of a single promoter. Expression of the marker gene in response to induction or selection usually indicates expression of the tandem gene as well.</p>In general, host cells that contain the nucleic acid sequence encoding TRICH and that express TRICH may be identified by a variety of procedures known to those of skill in the art. These procedures include, but are not limited to, DNA-DNA or DNA-RNA hybridizations, PCR amplification, and protein bioassay or immunoassay techniques which include membrane, solution, or chip based technologies for the detection and/or quantification of nucleic acid or protein sequences. Immunological methods for detecting and measuring the expression of TRICH using either specific polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies are known in the art. Examples of such techniques include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), radioimmunoassays (RIAs), and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). A two-site, monoclonal-based immunoassay utilizing monoclonal antibodies reactive to two non-interfering epitopes on TRICH is prefened, but a competitive binding assay may be employed. These and other assays are well known in the art. (See, e.g., Hampton, R. et al. (1990) Serological Methods, a Laboratory Manual. APS Press, St. Paul MN, Sect. JV; Coligan, J.E. et al. (1997) Cunent Protocols in Immunology. Greene Pub. Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York NY; and Pound, JD. (1998) Immunochemical Protocols, Humana Press, Totowa NJ.) \n\n A wide variety of labels and conjugation techniques are known by those skilled in the art and may be used in various nucleic acid and amino acid assays. Means for producing labeled hybridization or PCR probes for detecting sequences related to polynucleotides encoding TRICH include oligolabeling, nick translation, end-labeling, or PCR amplification using a labeled nucleotide. Alternatively, the sequences encoding TRICH, or any fragments thereof, may be cloned into a vector for the production of an mRNA probe. Such vectors are known in the art, are commercially available, and may be used to synthesize RNA probes in vitro by addition of an appropriate RNA polymerase such as T7, T3, or SP6 and labeled nucleotides. These procedures may be conducted using a variety of commercially available kits, such as those provided by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Promega (Madison WT), and US Biochemical. Suitable reporter molecules or labels which may be used for ease of detection include radionuclides, enzymes, fluorescent, chemiluminescent, or chromogenic agents, as well as substrates, cofactors, inhibitors,",
    " Burton, D.R. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88: 10134-10137.)</p>Antibodies may also be produced by inducing in vivo production in the lymphocyte population or by screening immunoglobulin libraries or panels of highly specific binding reagents as disclosed in the literature. (See, e.g., Orlandi, R. et al. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:3833-3837; Winter, G. et al. (1991) Nature 349:293-299.)</p>Antibody fragments which contain specific binding sites for TRICH may also be generated. For example, such fragments include, but are not limited to, F(ab)<sub>2</sub> fragments produced by pepsin digestion of the antibody molecule and Fab fragments generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of the F(ab')2 fragments. Alternatively, Fab expression libraries may be constructed to allow rapid and easy identification of monoclonal Fab fragments with the desired specificity. (See, e.g., Huse, W.D. et al. (1989) Science 246: 1275-1281.)</p>Various immunoassays may be used for screening to identify antibodies having the desired specificity. Numerous protocols for competitive binding or immunoradiometric assays using either polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies with established specificities are well known in the art. Such immunoassays typically involve the measurement of complex formation between TRICH and its specific antibody. A two-site, monoclonal-based immunoassay utilizing monoclonal antibodies reactive to two non-interfering TRICH epitopes is generally used, but a competitive binding assay may also be employed (Pound, supra).</p>Various methods such as Scatchard analysis in conjunction with radioimmunoassay techniques may be used to assess the affinity of antibodies for TRICH. Affinity is expressed as an association constant, K<sub>a</sub>, which is defined as the molar concentration of TRICH-antibody complex divided by the molar concentrations of free antigen and free antibody under equilibrium conditions. The K<sub>a</sub> determined for a preparation of polyclonal antibodies, which are heterogeneous in their affinities for multiple TRICH epitopes, represents the average affinity, or avidity, of the antibodies for TRICH. The K<sub>a</sub> determined for a preparation of monoclonal antibodies, which are monospecific for a particular TRICH epitope, represents a true measure of affinity. High-affinity antibody preparations with K<sub>a</sub> ranging from about 10<sup>9</sup> to 10<sup>12</sup> L/mole are prefened for use in immunoassays in which the TRICH-antibody complex must withstand rigorous manipulations. Low-affinity antibody preparations with K<sub>a</sub> ranging from about 10<sup>6</sup> to 10<sup>7</sup> L/mole are prefened for use in immunopurification and similar procedures which ultimately require dissociation of TRICH, \n\npreferably in active form, from the antibody (Catty, D.
