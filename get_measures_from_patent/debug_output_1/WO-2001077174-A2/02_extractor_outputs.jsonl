{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\nHigh-affinity antibody preparations with K<sub>a</sub> ranging from about 10<sup>9</sup> to 10<sup>12</sup> L/mole are prefened for use in immunoassays in which the TRICH-antibody complex must withstand rigorous manipulations.\nLow-affinity antibody preparations with K<sub>a</sub> ranging from about 10<sup>6</sup> to 10<sup>7</sup> L/mole are prefened for use in immunopurification and similar procedures which ultimately require dissociation of TRICH, \n\nNote that these sentences contain the molecule name \"TRICH\", a bioactivity metric \"K<sub>a</sub>\", a specific numeric value for that metric (e.g. \"10<sup>9</sup> to 10<sup>12</sup>\"), and a unit for that value (\"L/mole\")."}
