LCMS showed desired product peak.The reaction mixture was diluted with CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, washed with IN NaOH, extracted by CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> 2x, dried and concentrated. Purified by ISCO chromatography (4Og colunm, 0-50% EtOAc/Hexane). Intermediate c was reacted with TFA in methylenechloride for 30 mins and concentrated. LCMS showed 4 major peaks, DP peak at 1.32 min. The compound was dissolved in DMF, purified by prep HPLC (5%-30% 20 min, flow rate was reduced to 30 ml/min) and lyophilized to give 22 mg of compound 8 as a white loose powder. \n\n Example 12 IAP inhibition assays</p>In the following experiments was used a chimeric BIR domain referred to as MLXBIR3SG in which 11 of 110 residues correspond to those found in XIAP-BIR3, while the remainder correspond to ML-IAP-BIR. The chimeric protein MLXBIR3SG was shown to bind and inhibit caspase-9 significantly better than either of the native BIR domains, but bound Smac -based peptides and mature Smac with affinities similar to those of native ML-IAP-BIR. The improved caspase-9 inhibition of the chimeric BIR domain MLXBIR3SG has been correlated with increased inhibition of doxorubicin-induced apoptosis when transfected into MCF7 cells.</p>MLXBIR3SG sequence:</p>MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMLETEEEEEEGAGATLSRGPAFPGMGSEELRLASFYDWP LTAEVPPELLAAAGFFHTGHQDKVRCFFCYGGLQSWKRGDDPWTEHAKWFPGCQFLLR SKGQEYINNIHLTHSL (SEQ ID NO.: 1)</p>TR-FRET Peptide Binding Assay</p>Time-Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer competition experiments were performed on the Wallac Victor2 Multilabeled Counter Reader (Perkin Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Inc.) according to the procedures of KoIb et al (Journal of Biomolecular Screening, 1996, l(4):203). A reagent cocktail containing 300 nM his-tagged MLXBIR3SG; 200 nM biotinylated SMAC peptide (AVPI); 5 \u03bcg/mL anti-his allophycocyanin (XL665) (CISBio International); and 200 ng/mL streptavidin-europium (Perkin Elmer) was prepared in reagent buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.2], 120 mM NaCl, 0.1% bovine globulins, 5mM DTT and 0.05% octylglucoside). (Alternatively, this cocktail can be made using europium-labeled anti-His (Perkin Elmer) and streptavidin- allophycocyanin (Perkin Elmer) at concentrations of 6.5 nM and 25nM, respectively). The reagent cocktail was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. After incubation, the cocktail was added to 1 :3 serial dilutions of an antagonist compound (starting concentration of 50 \u03bcM) in 384- well black FIA plates (Greiner Bio-One, Inc.). After a 90 minute incubation at room temperature, the fluorescence was read with filters for the excitation of europium (340 nm) and for the emission wavelengths of europium (615 nm) and a allophycocyanin (665 nm). Antagonist data were calculated as a ratio of the emission signal of allophycocyanin at 665 nm to that of the emission of europium at 615 nm (these ratios were multiplied by a factor of 10,000 for ease of data manipulation). The resulting values were plotted as a function of antagonist concentration and fit to a 4-parameter equation using Kaleidograph software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). \n\n Indications of antagonist potency were determined from the IC50 values.
