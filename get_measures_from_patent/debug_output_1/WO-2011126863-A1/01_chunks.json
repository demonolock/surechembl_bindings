    "affinity of fHbp ID 22 for human fH, or of the binding affinity of fHbp ID1 for human fH. \n\n [0088] As another example, in some embodiments, the binding affinity of a subject mutant of fHbp ID 77 (e.g., an R41S/K113A, R41S/K119A, R41S/D121A, or a </p>R41S/K113A/D121A mutant of fHbp ID 77) for human fH is from about 85% to about 75%, from about 75% to about 65%, from about 65% to about 55%, from about 55% to about 45%, from about 45% to about 35%, from about 35% to about 25%, from about 25% to about 15%, from about 15% to about 10%, from about 10% to about 5%, from about 5% to about 2%, from about 2% to about 1%, or from about 1% to about 0.1%, or less than 0.1%, of the binding affinity of fHbp ID 77 for human fH, or of the binding affinity of fHbp ID1 for human fH. </p> [0089] As another example, in some embodiments, the binding affinity of a subject mutant of fHbp ID 28 (e.g., an E218A mutant or fHbp ID 28; a K199A mutant of fHbp ID 28) for human fH is from about 85% to about 75%, from about 75% to about 65%, from about 65% to about 55%, from about 55% to about 45%, from about 45% to about 35%, from about 35% to about 25%, from about 25% to about 15%, from about 15% to about 10%, from about 10% to about 5%, from about 5% to about 2%, from about 2% to about 1%, or from about 1% to about 0.1%, or less than 0.1%, of the binding affinity of fHbp ID 28 for human fH, or of the binding affinity of fHbp ID1 for human fH. </p> [0090] Binding affinity can be described in terms of the dissociation constant (KD). Low- affinity fHbps and human fH can have a dissociation constant (KD; M) that is at least more than about 80%, at least more than about 100%, at least more than about 120%, at least more than about 140%, at least more than about 160%, at least more than about 200%, or more than K<sub>D</sub> of high affinity fHbps (e.g. fHbp ID 1) and human fH. The K<sub>D</sub> of a low-affinity fHbp can also be described as about 2X (2 times), about 3X, about 5X, about 10X, about 15X, about 20X, up to about 50 or more times the KD of fHbp ID 1. For example, a subject fHbp and human fH can have a K<sub>D</sub> that is 110% of or about 15X that of fHbp ID 1 and human fH. </p>[0091] As used herein, \"lower affinity for human fH than a corresponding fHbp\" is used to describe fHbps that have a binding affinity lower than a corresponding reference fHbp. </p>[0092] In many cases, the corresponding fHbp (the \"reference fHbp\") used to compare the binding affinities of subject fHbps is fHbp ID 1. Other corresponding fHbp that can be representative as a reference include variant 2 fHbp (e.g. fHbp ID 22 or 77), variant 3 (e.g. fHbp ID 28) (Masignani et al (2003) J Exp Med 197:789-99 and Pajon R et al (2010) Vaccine 28:2122-9), other variant 1 fHbps (e.g. fHbp ID 4, 9, or 94), a naturally-occurring chimeric, or a man-made chimeric fHbp. \n\n [0093] The amino acid sequences of some examples of naturally-occurring fHbps and a man-made chimeric are provided below and shown in Figure 45. </p>[0094] FHbp ID 22 </p> CSSGGGGVAADIGAGLADALTAPLDHKDKSLQSLTLDQSVRKNEKLKLAAQGAEKT</p>YGNGDSLNTGKLKNDKVSRFDFIRQIEVDGQLITLESGEFQIYKQDHSAVVALQIEKI</p>NNPDKIDSLINQRSFLVSGLGGEHTAFNQLPSGKAEYHGKAFSSDDPNGRLHYSIDFT</p>KKQGYGRIEHLKTPEQNVELASAELKADEKSHAVILGDTRYGGEEKGTYHLALFGD</p>RAQEIAGSATVKIREKVHEIGIAGKQ (SEQ ID NO: 2) </p> [0095] FHbp ID 28 </p> CSSGGGGSGGGGVAADIGTGLADALTAPLDHKDKGLKSLTLEDSIPQNGTLTLSAQG</p>AEKTFKAGDKDNSLNTGKLKNDKISRFDFVQKIEVDGQTITLASGEFQIYKQNHSAV</p>VALQIEKINNPDKTDSLINQRSFLVSGLGGEHTAFNQLPGGKAEYHGKAFSSDDPNG</p>RLHYSIDFTKKQGYGRI",
    "ogen). Antibody concentrations were assigned by comparison with concentration-dependent binding of a human IgGl standard (monoclonal \u03ba chain antibody from human myeloma, Sigma). Binding of the anti-fHbp mAbs to fHbp was measured by ELISA with recombinant fHbp on the plate. The secondary detecting antibody was goat anti-human \u03ba chain specific antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Biosource). </p> [00308] Surface plasmon resonance. The kinetics of binding of the human-mouse chimeric mAbs to fHbp was measured by surface plasmon resonance with immobilized recombinant fHbp (500 or 1000 response units) on CM5 chips (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), which \n\n was performed via amine coupling (Amine Coupling kit, GE Healthcare). Kinetics of binding were determined at mAb concentrations ranging from 0.016 to 50 \u03bcg/ml (0.1 \u03bc\u039c to 333 \u03bc\u039c) using a Biacore T / 100 instrument (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). </p> [00309] Binding to N. meningitidis by flow cytometry. Binding of the chimeric mAbs to the surface of live encapsulated bacteria was measured with strain H44/76 (B: 15:P1.7,16; ST- 32), which is a relatively high expresser of fHbp ID 1 (Welsch et al. (2008) /. Infect. Dis. 197: 1053; Welsch et al. (2004) /. Immunol. 172:5606). In some experiments, isogenic knockout (KO) mutants of H44/76 in which fHbp, NspA or both proteins were not expressed, were tested. The respective genotypes we fHbp:Erm, NspA:Spc, and fHbp:Erm/NspA:Spc (Lewis et al. (2010) PLoS Pathog. 6:el001027). The binding assay was performed as previously described except that test or control antibodies were incubated together with the cells for 1 hr at room temperature instead of 2 hrs on ice. Antibody bound to the bacteria was detected by CF488A goat anti-human IgG (BioTium). </p> [00310] Inhibition of binding offH. The ability of the anti-fHbp mAbs to inhibit binding of fH to fHbp was measured by ELISA. Wells of a microtiter plate were coated with </p>recombinant fHbp (2 \u03bcg/ml). Dilutions of the mAbs were added and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 hrs, followed by human fH (Complement Tech.), 2 \u03bcg/ml, which was incubated for an additional 1 hour at room temperature. After washing with PBS-0.05 Tween 20, bound fH was detected by a sheep polyclonal antiserum to fH (Abeam) followed by donkey anti-sheep IgG antibody (Sigma Aldrich) conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. The results were expressed as the percentage of inhibition of fH binding in the presence of an anti-fHbp mAb compared with fH binding in the absence of the mAb. </p> [00311] The ability of the anti-fHbp mAbs to inhibit binding of fH to the surface of live bacterial cells was measured by flow cytometry. H44/76 bacteria were incubated with 50 \u03bcg/ml of anti-fHbp mAb and different concentrations of purified fH for 30 mins at room temperature. After washing the cells, bound fH was detected by a sheep polyclonal antiserum to fH (Lifespan Bioscience) followed by donkey anti-sheep IgG antibody (Invitrogen) conjugated with green-fluorescen"
