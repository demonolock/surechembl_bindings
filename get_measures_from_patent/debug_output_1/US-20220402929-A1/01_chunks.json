    " of these hydrogen atoms have been replaced by deuterium atoms. Half-life determinations enable favorable and accurate determination of the extent of the extent to which the improvement in resistance to oxidative metabolism has improved. In this way, it is determined that the half-life of the parent compound can be extended by up to 100% as the result of deuterium-hydrogen exchange of this type.</p>Deuterium-hydrogen exchange in a compound of formula (I) or formula (II) can also be used to achieve a favorable modification of the metabolite spectrum of the starting compound in order to diminish or eliminate undesired toxic metabolites. For example, if a toxic metabolite arises through oxidative carbon-hydrogen (C\u2014H) bond cleavage, it can reasonably be assumed that the deuterated analogue will greatly diminish or eliminate production of the unwanted metabolite, even if the particular oxidation is not a rate-determining step. Further information on the state of the art with respect to deuterium-hydrogen exchange may be found, for example in Hanzlik et al., J. Org. Chem. 55, 3992-3997, 1990, Reider et al., J. Org.

In certain embodiments, a modulator has an IC<sub>50 </sub>and/or binding constant of less about 50 \u03bcM, less than about 1 \u03bcM, less than about 500 nM, less than about 100 nM, or less than about 10 nM.</p>The terms \u201cmeasurable affinity\u201d and \u201cmeasurably inhibit,\u201d as used herein, means a measurable change in FSHR activity between a sample comprising a compound of the present invention, or composition thereof, and FSHR, and an equivalent sample comprising FSHR, in the absence of said compound, or composition thereof.</p>Combinations of substituents and variables envisioned by this invention are only those that result in the formation of stable compounds. The term \u201cstable\u201d, as used herein, refers to compounds which possess stability sufficient to allow manufacture and which maintains the integrity of the compound for a sufficient period of time to be useful for the purposes detailed herein (e.g., therapeutic or prophylactic administration to a subject).</p>The recitation of a listing of chemical groups in any definition of a variable herein includes definitions of that variable as any single group or combination of listed groups. The recitation of an embodiment for a variable herein includes that embodiment as any single embodiment or in combination with any other embodiments or portions thereof.</p>3.
