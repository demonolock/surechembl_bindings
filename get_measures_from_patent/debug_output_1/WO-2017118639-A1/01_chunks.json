The term \"K\", as used herein, is intended to refer to the inhibition constant of an antagonist for a particular molecule of interest, and is expressed as a molar concentration (M). Ki values for antagonist- target interactions can be determined, e.g., using methods established in the art. Methods that can be used to determine the Ki of an antagonist for a molecular target include competitive binding experiments, such as competitive radioligand binding assays, e.g., as described in US 8,415,480. The term \"Kd\", as used herein, is intended to refer to the dissociation constant, which can be obtained, e.g., from the ratio of the rate constant for the dissociation of the two molecules (kd) to the rate constant for the association of the two molecules (k<sub>a</sub>) and is expressed as a molar concentration (M). Kd values for receptor-ligand interactions can be determined, e.g., using methods established in the art. Methods that can be used to determine the Kd of a receptor-ligand interaction include surface plasmon resonance, e.g., through the use of a biosensor system such as a BIACORE<sup>\u00ae</sup> system. </p> As used herein, the term \"corticosteroid\" refers to any of the steroid hormones produced by the adrenal cortex or their synthetic equivalents. Exemplary corticosteroids include betamethasone, dexamethasone, and hydrocortisone, among others, as well as variants thereof. Corticosteroids for use in conjunction with the compositions and methods described herein include those capable of inducing fetal lung maturation, for instance, so as to prevent the development of respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants. Exemplary corticosteroids for use in conjunction with the compositions and methods described herein include those described in Jobe et al. Am. J . Obstet. Gynecol. 190:878-881 (2004) and Miracle et al. J. Perinat. Med. 36:191 -196 (2008), the disclosures of each of which are incorporated herein by reference. \n\n As used herein, the term \"crystalline\" or \"crystalline form\" means having a physical state that is a regular three-dimensional array of atoms, ions, molecules or molecular assemblies. Crystalline forms have lattice arrays of building blocks called asymmetric units that are arranged according to well-defined symmetries into unit cells that are repeated in three-dimensions. In contrast, the term \"amorphous\" or \"amorphous form\" refers to an unorganized (no orderly) structure. The physical state of a therapeuti",
    "a particular organism (e.g., a human) or in a particular location within an organism (e.g., an organ, a tissue, or a cell, such as a human cell). Exogenous materials include those that are provided from an external source to an organism or to cultured matter extracted therefrom. </p> As used herein, the term \"gestational age\" describes how far along a particular pregnancy is, and is measured from the first day of a pregnant female subject's last menstrual cycle to the current date. As used herein, the term \"labor\" (which may also be termed birth) relates to the expulsion of the fetus and placenta from the uterus of a pregnant female subject. For a normal pregnancy, labor may occur at a gestational age of about 40 weeks. \"Preterm labor\" as used herein refers to a condition in which labor commences more than three weeks before the full gestation period, which is typically about 40 weeks. That is, preterm labor occurs at any stage prior to, e.g., 38 weeks of gestation. Preterm labor typically leads to the occurrence of labor, or physiological changes associated with labor in a pregnant female subject, if not treated. Preterm labor may or may not be associated with vaginal bleeding or rupture of uterine membranes. Preterm labor may also be referred to as premature labor. The avoidance of preterm labor in a subject will prolong the term of pregnancy and may therefore avoid preterm delivery, thus reducing the risk of neonatal mortality and morbidity. </p> As used herein, the term \"IC50\" refers to the concentration of a substance (antagonist) that reduces the efficacy of a reference agonist or the constitutive activity of a biological target by 50%, e.g., as measured in a competitive ligand binding assay. Exemplary competitive ligand binding assays include competitive radioligand binding assays, competitive enzyme-linked \n\n immunosorbent assays (ELISA), and fluorescence anisotropy-based assays, among others known in the art. </p> As used herein in the context of providing or administering two or more therapeutic agents to a subject, the phrase \"in combination with\" refers to the delivery of two or more therapeutic agents to a subject (e.g., a mammalian subject, such as a human subject), for instance, either concurrently or at different times. For example, one therapeutic agent may be administered to a subject in combination with another by administering both agents to the subject concurrently, such as in a single pharmaceutical composition or in separate compositions that are administered to the subject simultaneously (e.g., by different routes of administration). In another example, one therapeutic agent may be administered to a subject in combination with another by first administering to the subject one therapeutic agent and subsequently administering the other therapeutic agent, either by the same or different route of administration. </p> As used herein, the term \"nolasiban\" refers to (3Z,5S)-5-(hydroxymethyl)-1 -[(2'-methyl- 1 ,1 '-biphenyl-4-yl)carbonyl]pyrrolidin-3-one O-methyloxime, represented by the following structural formula: </p><img id=\"imgf000033_0001\" path=\"imgf000033_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/397195925/WO/201",
    "nt, such as a subject experiencing or at risk of undergoing preterm labor. A therapeutic agent may be provided to a subject in need thereof, for instance, by direct administration of the therapeutic agent to the subject, or by administration of a prodrug that is converted in vivo to the therapeutic agent upon administration of the prodrug to the subject. Exemplary prodrugs include, without limitation, esters, phosphates, and other chemical functionalities susceptible to hydrolysis upon administration to a subject. Prodrugs include those known in the art, such as those described, for instance, in Vig et al., Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. </p>65:1370-1385 (2013), and Huttunen et al., Pharmacol. Rev. 63:750-771 (2011 ), the disclosures of each of which are incorporated herein by reference. </p> As used herein, the term \"sample\" refers to a specimen (e.g., blood, blood component</p>(e.g., serum or plasma), urine, saliva, amniotic fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue (e.g., placental or dermal), pancreatic fluid, chorionic villus sample, and cells) isolated from a subject. \n\n As used herein, the phrases \"specifically binds\" and \"binds\" refer to a binding reaction which is determinative of the presence of a particular protein in a heterogeneous population of proteins and other biological molecules that is recognized, e.g., by a ligand with particularity. A ligand (e.g., a protein, proteoglycan, or glycosaminoglycan) that specifically binds to a protein will bind to the protein, e.g., with a KD of less than 100 nM. For example, a ligand that specifically binds to a protein may bind to the protein with a KD of up to 100 nM (e.g., between 1 pM and 100 nM). A ligand that does not exhibit specific binding to a protein or a domain thereof will exhibit a KD of greater than 100 nM (e.g., greater than 200 nM, 300 nM, 400 nM, 500 nM, 600 nm, 700 nM, 800 nM, 900 nM, 1 \u03bc\u039c, 100 \u03bc\u039c, 500 \u03bc\u039c, or 1 mM) for that particular protein or domain thereof. A variety of assay formats may be used to determine the affinity of a ligand for a specific protein.</p>For example, solid-phase ELISA assays are routinely used to identify ligands that specifically bind a target protein. See, e.g., Harlow &amp; Lane, Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Press, New York (1988) and Harlow &amp; Lane, Using Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Press, New York (1999), for a description of assay formats and conditions that can be used to determine specific protein binding. </p> As used herein, the terms \"subject\" and \"patient\" are interchangeable and refer to an organism that receives treatment for a particular disease or condition as described herein (such as preterm labor or dysmenorrhea) or that is diagnosed as having a disease or condition according to the methods described herein. Examples of subjects and patients include mammals, such as humans, receiving treatment for diseases or conditions, for example, preterm labor at an early gestational age (e.g., 24-34 weeks). </p> A compound, salt form, crystal polymorph, therapeutic agent, or other composition described herein may be referred to as being characterized by graphical data </p>\"substantially as depicted in\" a figure. Such data may include, without limitation, powder X-ray",
    "[1 -(4-fluorophenyl)-3-hydroxypropyl]-1 ,3-thiazolidine-2- carboxamide. As described herein, this compound may be provided to a subject (e.g., a mammalian subject, such as a human) that is undergoing or is at risk of undergoing labor at an early gestational age, e.g., prior to 38 weeks (e.g., from about 20 to about 37 weeks, such as a gestational age of about 20 weeks, 21 weeks, 22 weeks, 23 weeks, 24 weeks, 25 weeks, 26 weeks, 27 weeks, 28 weeks, 29 weeks, 30 weeks, 31 weeks, 32 weeks, 33 weeks, 34 weeks, 35 weeks, 36 weeks, or 37 weeks, preferably from about 24 to about 34 weeks, such as a gestational age of about 24 weeks, 25 weeks, 26 weeks, 27 weeks, 28 weeks, 29 weeks, 30 weeks, 31 weeks, 32 weeks, 33 weeks, or 34 weeks), optionally in combination with one or more additional therapeutic agents as described herein. </p>(3S)-3-({[(2S)-3-(biphenyl-4-ylsulfonyl)-1,3-thiazolidin-2-yl]carbonyl}-amino)-3-(4- fluorophenyl)propyl L-valinate (Compound I) </p> The invention is based on the discovery that compound I ((3S)-3-({[(2S)-3-(biphenyl-4- ylsulfonyl)-1 ,3-thiazolidin-2-yl]carbonyl}-amino)-3-(4-fluorophenyl)propyl L-valinate, represented by formula I, below) and salts thereof are converted in vivo to 3-([1 ,1 '-biphenyl]-4-ylsulfonyl)-/V-[1 - (4-fluorophenyl)-3-hydroxypropyl]-1 ,3-thiazolidine-2-carboxamide (represented by formula II, below). Compound II, previously described in US 8,415,480, is an antagonist of the </p>prostaglandin F receptor, as this compound exhibits an inhibition constant (Ki) of 6 nM for human FP-R as determined by competitive radioligand binding assays (experimental details of competitive radioligand binding assays useful for the determination of Ki values are described, e.g., in US 8,415,480, Example 51 ). Following administration to a subject, compound I has been found to be de-esterified in vivo so as to form compound II due to the activity of endogenous esterases, such as those present in the gastrointestinal tract. \n\n</p><img id=\"imgf000072_0001\" path=\"imgf000072_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/397195927/WO/20170713/A1/002017/11/86/39/imgf000072_0001.tif\"/></p> (I) (II) </p> It has been discovered that compound I is an inhibitor of the prostaglandin F receptor, as compound I inhibits human FP-R with a Ki of 1 nM. Compound I exhibits improvements in several physicochembal characteristics relative to compound II, including solubility in water as well as in media that simulate the small intestinal contents in the fed (FeSSIF) and fasted (FaSSIF) states. These data are summarized in Table 2, below. </p>. Comparison of physicochembal properties of compound I and compound II </p><img id=\"imgf000072_0002\" path=\"imgf000072_0002.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/397195912/WO/20170713/A1/002017/11/86/39/imgf000072_0002.tif\"/></p> In addition to exhibiting enhanced aqueous solubility, compound I and salts thereof feature a surprising and beneficial absorption mechanism. As described in the Examples below, compound I is de-esterified by ambient esterases in the small intestine and subsequently penetrates the small intestinal epithelium passively. Surprisingly, compound I and salts thereof are not substrates for the Peptl transporter protein, a proton-coupled co-transporter that mediates the absorption of peptidic nutrients. This discovery represents an unexpected and pharmacologically beneficial property. Peptl is known to mediate the absorption of a variety of valinate esters, as described, for example, in Vig et al., Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 65:1370-1385 (2013), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Peptl exhibits broad substrate specificity, as evidenced by the structural diversity of compounds that are transported across the intestinal epi"
