    "es colonies of human tumor cells and defines borders between metastatic lesions and mouse lung parenchyma. The largest size differences between VEGF<sub>12</sub>\u03b9/rGel and control groups were found in groups of colonies having diameter either less than 50 \u03bcm or more than 1000 \u03bcm. In the VEGF<sub>121</sub>/rGel-treated mice more \n\nthan 40% of total foci were extremely small (&lt; 50 micron) as compared to 18% in the control group. The control mice had approximately 8% of extremely large colonies (&gt;1000 \u03bcm) whereas VEGF<sub>121</sub>/rGel-treated mice did not have colonies of this size.</p>\n  Figures 18A-B show VEGF<sub>121</sub>/rGel inhibits vascularization of MDA- MB-231 pulmonary metastases. Lungs derived from VEGF<sub>121</sub>/rGel and rGel - treated mice were stained with MECA 32 antibody and the number of vessels per mm<sup>2</sup> within the metastatic foci was determined (Figure 18A). The mean number of vessels per mm<sup>2</sup> in lung metastases of VEGF<sub>121</sub>/rGel-treated mice was reduced by approximately 50% as compared to those in rGel-treated mice. Figure 18B shows representative images demonstrating reduction of vascular density in foci of comparable size in mice treated with rGel (left) and VEGF<sub>121</sub>/rGel fusion protein (right).</p>\n  Figure 19 shows VEGF<sub>121</sub>/rGel inhibits proliferation of metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells in the lungs. Frozen sections of lungs derived from VEGF<sub>121</sub>/rGel or rGel-treated mice were stained with Ki-67 antibody. Stained sections were examined under x40 objective to detemiine the number of tumor cells with positive nuclei (cycling cells). Positive cells^were enumerated in 10 colonies per slide on six sections derived from individual mice per each treatment group. The mean number per group \u00b1 SEM is presented. VEGF<sub>121</sub>/rGel treatment reduced the average number of cycling cells within the metastatic foci by approximately 60%. Figure 20 shows detection of VEGFR-2 on vasculature of metastatic lesions by anti- VEGFR-2 antibody RAFL-1. Frozen sections of lungs from mice treated with VEGF<sub>121</sub>/rGel or free gelonin were stained with monoclonal rat anti- mouse VEGFR-2 antibody RAFL-1 (10 \u03bcg/ml). RAFL-1 antibody was detected by goat anti-rat IgG-HRP. Sections were developed with DAB and counterstained with hematoxylin. Representative images of lung metastases of comparable size (700-800 \u03bcm in the largest diameter) from each treatment group are shown. Images were taken with an objective of X20. Note that the pulmonary metastases from the VEGF<sub>121</sub>/rGel treated group show both reduced vessel density and decreased intensity of anti-VEGFR-2 staining compared to control lesions. Figure 21 shows VEGFj<sub>2</sub>\u03b9/rGel strongly inhibits the growth of prostate cancer cells PC-3 placed in the bone micro-environment in mice. Animals were anesthesized prior to injection of 50,000 PC-3 cells into the distal epipysis of \n\nthe right femur. Treatment with VEGF<sub>1",
    " No. vascular foci/ 76/127 27/92 (29.3%) 51 total analyzed (%&gt;)<sup>c</sup> (59.8%)</p>\n  <sup>a</sup> Colonies identified on each slide of a metastatic lung were subdivided into 5 groups according to their largest diameter. <sup>b</sup> Frozen lung sections from VEGF<sub>121</sub>/rGel or rGel treated mice were stained with MECA 32 antibody. A colony was defined as vascularized if at least one blood vessel branched out from the periphery and reached a center of the lesion. Six slides per each group derived from individual mice were analyzed and data were combined. <sup>c</sup> Total number of the analyzed colonies was 127 and 92 for rGel and VEGF<sub>121</sub>/rGel treated groups, respectively. Seventy percent of foci in the VEGF<sub>121</sub>/rGel-treated group were avascular whereas only 40% of lesions from the control group did not have vessels within the metastatic foci. \n\n EXAMPLE 21</p>\n  Effect of VEGF^/rGel On The Number of Cycling Cells In The MDA-MB-231 Pulmonary Metastatic Foci Frozen sections of normal mouse organs and metastatic lungs were fixed with acetone for 5 min and rehydrated with PBST for 10 min. All dilutions of antibodies were prepared in PBST containing 0.2% BSA. Primary antibodies were detected by appropriate anti-mouse, anti-rat or anti-rabbit HRP conjugates (Daco, Carpinteria, CA). HRP activity was detected by developing with DAB substrate (Research Genetics).</p>\n  To determine the number of cycling cells, tissue sections were stained with the ki-67 antibody (Abeam, Inc., Cambridge, UK) followed by anti-mouse IgG HRP conjugate. Sections were analyzed at magnification of xlOO. Number of cells positive for ki-67 was normalized per mm<sup>2</sup>. The mean number \u00b1 SD per VEGF<sub>121</sub>/rGel or control group is presented. The average numbers derived from analysis of each slide were combined per either VEGF<sub>121</sub>/rGel or rGel group and analyzed for statistical differences.</p>\n  The number of cycling tumor cells in lesions from the VEGF<sub>121</sub>/rGel group was reduced by -60% as compared to controls (Figure 19). The overall mean vascular density of lung colonies was reduced by 51% (Table 3 and Figure 18). These findings suggest that vascularity of metastases directly affects tumor cell proliferation.</p>\n  EXAMPLE 22</p>\n  Effect of VEGF r/rGel on flk-1 Expression in Tumor Vessel Endotheluim of The MDA-MB-231 Pulmonary Metastatic Foci</p>\n  The expression of VEGF receptor-2 on the vasculature of breast tumors metastatic to lung was assessed using the RAF-1 antibody. Frozen sections of lungs from mice treated with VEGF<sub>121</sub>/rGel or free gelonin were stained with monoclonal rat anti-mouse VEGFR-2 antibody RAFL-1 (10 \u03bcg/ml). RAFL-1 antibody was detected by goat anti-rat IgG-HRP. The expression of KDR on the remaining few vessels present in lung metastatic foci demonstrated a significant decline compared to that of lung foci present in control tumors (Figure 20). This suggests \n\nthat the VEGF<sub>1 1</sub>/rGel agent is able to significantly down-regulate the receptor or prevent the outgrowth of highly receptor-positive endothelial cells.</p>\n  EXAMPLE 23 Su"
