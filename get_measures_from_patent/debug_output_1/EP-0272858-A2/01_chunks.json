Virol. 39:125-137), or Spodoptera littoralis (Sl NPV) (Harrap, K.A., Payne, C.C. and Robertson, J.S. [1977] Virology 79:14-31) can be used instead of Autographa californica NPV. Other insect cell lines can also be substituted for Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9), for example, Tricho\u00adplusia ni (Volkman, L.E. and Summers, M.D. [1975] J. Virol. 16:1630-1637), Spodoptera exigua, Choristo\u00adneura fumiferana (Smith, G. and Summers, M.D. [1981] J. Virol. 39:125-137) and Spodoptera littoralis (Harrap, K.A. et al. [1977] Virology 79:14-31).</p>The accompanying drawing shows the construction of pAcHT3. In the drawing, Lig = ligate, Tr = transform, and Syn olig = synthetic oligonucleotide.</p>Using the Baculovirus expression vector, we have expressed the HIV envelope primary translation product, gp160. It is expressed using the polyhedrin gene promotor and 4\u02b9 untranslated region and the HIV envelope secretion signal sequence (Figure 1). The protein product migrates on denaturing polyacrylamide gels as a 160 kD protein. That the protein is extensively glycosylated is demon\u00adstrated by staining gp160 with the carbohydrate-specific stain perchloric acid. After treatment with an endoglycosidase, for example, N-GLYCANASE<sup>TM</sup>, (Genzyme Corp., Boston MA), the protein migrates at 96 kD on denaturing polyacrylamide gels, only slightly larger than the size predicted for the entire envelope poly\u00adpeptide. The recombinant envelope protein has been localized to the cell surface of infected insect cells, indicating secretion and insertion in the cell membrane.</p>To obtain immune sera to gp160, goats were immunized with pure gp160 or whole insect cells infected with the HIV recombinant baculovirus. The adjuvant was complete Freunds adjuvant. Pure gp160 protein for immunization was obtained from preparative denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Sera from goats immunized with pure gp160 or insect cells expressing gp160 specifically bind gp160, gp120, and gp41 on Western blots. Therefore, animals immunized with recombinant gp160 develop immune recognition to the natural viral envelope of HIV.</p>Immunochemical assays employing the HIV proteins of the invention can take a variety of forms. The preferred type is a solid phase immunometric assay. In assays of this type, an HIV protein is immobilized on a solid phase to form an antigen-immunoadsorbent. The immunoadsorbent is incubated with the sample to be tested. After an appropriate incubation period, the immunoadsorbent is separated from the sample and labeled anti-(human IgG) antibody is used to detect human anti-\u00adHIV antibody bound to the immunoadsorbent. The amount of label associated with the immunoadsorbent can be compared to positive and negative controls to assess the present or absence of anti-HIV antibody.</p>Th",
    "FH plus 10% FBS plus antibiotics) was added.5. Cultures were incubated at 27\u00b0C for 2-4 days and examined daily.6. The cell pellet was used for purification of gp160.</p>Example 5--Recovery and purification of recombinantgp160 to its essentially pure form1. 300 ml of cells in culture medium was centrifuged (3,000 xg, 10\u02b9), washed once with 20 ml phosphate buffered saline and the cells collected by centri\u00adfugation.2. Cells were resuspended in 20 ml CMST buffer (0.03 M Tris pH 7.5, 0.01 M MgAcetate, 1% NONIDET P-40 [a non-ionic surfactant from Shell, Houston TX]) by vortexing and pipeting.3. Cells wre pelleted for 5 min at 3,000 rpm.4. Cells were resuspended in 20 ml 8 M urea buffer by vortexing for 5 min (8 M urea, 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 15 mM 2-mercaptoethanol [BME], 1 mM ethylenediamine\u00adtetraacetic acid [EDTA], 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [PMSF]).5. Cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 8,000 rpm.6. Supernatant was decanted and the pellet resuspended in 4 ml 0.1% sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS).7. An equal volume of 2X SDS loading buffer was added, boiled for 5 min, and run on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (18 x 16 x 0.3 mm) (75 mA for approximately 5-6 hr or 20 mA overnight).8. To visualize gp160 protein:\na. Gel was placed on a plate in ice cold 0.25 M KCl for 15 min (in refrigerator or freezer if possible).b. Gel was removed, wrapped with SARAN wrap (Dow Chemi\u00adcal, Midlan, MI) and left overnight at 4\u00b0C.c. The protein bands appeared white, and gp160 migrated at approximately 160 kD.9. The gp160 band was cut from the gel.10. gp160 was eluted from the gel by soaking the gel overnight in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 M NaCl, and 0.1% SDS to give essentially pure gp160 protein.</p>Example 6--Clone pAcHT7, gp160 of HIV variant RFThe cloning of the gp160 from variant RF (Popovic, M. et al. (1984) Science 224:497-500) was facilitated by using the plasmid (pEC160) described in Example 1, No. 7 as a starting point. This plasmid already has the necessary linkage sites for subcloning into the Baculovirus expression vector pAc610 as described in Example 1, Nos. 8-10. To insert gp160 sequences from RF, unique restriction enzyme sites within the two genes were used as described below:</p>Plasmid PEc160 was digested with DraIII and AvaI and the larger of the two fragments, 3600 bp, was isolated from an agarose gel by standard procedures. This fragment contains all of the pUC19 sequences as well as N-terminal amino acids of gp160 up to the DraIII site and C-terminal amino acids beyond the AvaI site. The major portion of the gp160 gene was provided by digestion of genomic clone of HIV variant RF. An 1828-bp fragment from RF envelope gene was prepared by DraIII/AvaI digestion and standard agarose gel techniques. This fragment contains the major portion of the envelope gene and has 88% of the variant amino acids of RF.</p>These fragments were ligated together and the mixture was used to transform E. coli JM103. Ampicillin-\u00adresistant colonies were selected and plasmid DNA was",
    "NA isolated by standard procedures. Analysis of the StuI/HindIII digestion patterns confirmed pure wild-type clones and pure mutant clones. The clone resulting from the oligonucleotide mutagenesis described above is designated pHT5.</p>Example 9--Transfer of gp120 gene into vector appropriatefor expression in insect cellsThis pUC clone, pHT5, was digested as described in Example 1, No. 7 and cloned into pAc610 as described in Example 1, Nos. 8, 9, and 10. This plasmid is designated pAcHT5 and is appropriate for expressing gp120 from variant BH10 in cultured insect cells. Transfection of Sf9 insect cells with pAcHT5 was done as described for pAcHT3 and the variant gp160 clones. Subsequent steps involved in isolating the recombinant gp120 virus, infecting and growing cultured insect cells is also as described for pAcHT3. The difference in harvesting the growth for purification of gp120 versus gp160 lies in the fact that the majority of the gp120 protein is released into the culture medium.</p>Example 10--Purification of gp120Purification of gp120 from cultured insect cell medium is accomplished by dialysis and concentration of the medium by standard techniques and, subsequently, by affinity chromatography using a column prepared from serum of individuals with Aids Related Complex (ARC). Further purification was accomplished by running the eluant on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamid gel as described in Example 5, Nos. 7, 8, and 9 (note: migration was at the position corresponding to 120 kD rather than 160 kD). This material is immunoreactive to antisera raised to gp160 and should have essentially the same anti-HIV immunological properties in relation to virus neutrali\u00adzation as gp160 from insect cells.</p>Example 11--Cell fusion inhibitionThe in vitro fusion of HIV-infected cells with T4 positive T cells is measured in the presence and absence of immune serum. This is a well-known assay (Putney, et al. [1986] Science 234:1392-1395).</p>Chronically infected cells and uninfected cells (1:15) are mixed and incubated 24 hr. Foci of fused cells (giant cells) are then counted (usually about 60). Dilution of an immune serum, for example, serum to the entire HIV envelope (gp160) is added when the cells are mixed. A 90% decrease in giant cells after 24 hr indicates the immune serum can block fusion. This assay can be done with cells infected with various virus strains. Examples for HIV<sub>IIIB</sub>, HIV<sub>RF</sub>, and HIV<sub>IIIB/RF</sub> hybrid are shown in Table 6.</p>Results from antisera of two goats immunized with gp160 obtained from the infection of insect cells with the recombinant baculovirus HT3 are shown in Table 5. Controls with pre-immune serum from both goats (average of both is shown) give expected numbers of giant cells from mid 60's to low 70's in contrast with the immune serum values at 1/10 and 1/30 dilutions.</p>When compared with human serum from an ARC patient at a 1/30 dilution the goat antisera to recombinant gp160 was more effective at blocking cell fusion"
