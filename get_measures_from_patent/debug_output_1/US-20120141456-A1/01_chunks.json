Molecules of any size or composition can serve as targets.</p>The SELEX method involves selection from a mixture of candidate oligonucleotides and step-wise iterations of binding, partitioning and amplification, using the same general selection scheme, to achieve desired binding affinity and selectivity. Starting from a mixture of nucleic acids, which can comprise a segment of randomized sequence, the SELEX method includes steps of contacting the mixture with the target under conditions favorable for binding; partitioning unbound nucleic acids from those nucleic acids which have bound specifically to target molecules; dissociating the nucleic acid-target complexes; amplifying the nucleic acids dissociated from the nucleic acid-target complexes to yield a ligand enriched mixture of nucleic acids. The steps of binding, partitioning, dissociating and amplifying are repeated through as many cycles as desired to yield highly specific high affinity nucleic acid ligands to the target molecule.</p>Nucleotide aptamers can be used, for example, as diagnostic tools or as specific inhibitors to dissect intracellular signaling and transport pathways (James, Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 1:540-546 (2001)). The high affinity and specificity of nucleotide aptamers makes them good candidates for drug discovery. For example, aptamer antagonists to the toxin ricin have been isolated and have IC50 values in the nanomolar range (Hesselberth J R et al., J Biol Chem 275:4937-4942 (2000)). Nucleotide aptamers can also be used against infectious disease, malignancy and viral surface proteins to reduce cellular infectivity.</p>Nucleotide aptamers for use in the methods described herein can be modified (e.g., by modifying the backbone or bases or conjugated to peptides) as described herein for other polynucleotides.</p>Using the protein structure of DR6, screening for aptamers that act on DR6 using the SELEX process would allow for the identification of aptamers that inhibit DR6-mediated processes.</p>Polypeptide aptamers for use in the methods described herein are random peptides selected for their ability to bind to and thereby block the action of DR6. Polypeptide aptamers can include a short variable peptide domain attached at both ends to a protein scaffold. This double structural constraint greatly increases the binding affinity of the peptide aptamer to levels comparable to an antibody's (nanomolar range). See, e.g., Hoppe-Seyler F et al., J Mol Med 78(8):426-430 (2000). The length of the short variable peptide is typically about 10 to 20 amino acids, and the scaffold can be any protein which has good solubility and compacity properties. One non-limiting example of a scaffold protein is the bacterial protein Thioredoxin-A. See, e.g., Cohen B A et al., PNAS 95(24): 14272-14277 (1998).</p>Polypeptide aptamers are peptides or small polypeptides that act as dominant in"
