    " the expression and purification of (CA-CTD)<sub>2</sub> and (CA-CTD),- FLAG.</p>The purified (CA-CTD)<sub>2</sub> and (CA-CTD)<sub>2</sub>-FLAG proteins were characterized by electrospray mass spectrometry (MW<sub>obs</sub> = 17,599 g/mol, W<sub>cal0</sub> = 17,602 g/mol for (CA-CTD)<sub>2</sub>; MW<sub>obs</sub> = 18,709 g/mol; WW<sub>calc</sub> = 18,711 g/mol for (CA-CTD),- FLAG). \n\n c) Dimerization assays by gel filtration and equilibrium sedimentation</p>Superdex 75 gel filtration column (Pharmacia) was used to determine the oligomerization state of (CA-CTD)<sub>2</sub> (Figure 12A). 1 ml of (CA-CTD)<sub>2</sub> protein was loaded at a concentration of 4mg/ml in 25 mM phosphate (pH 7.2), 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. Protein standards were run under the same conditions. A plot of relative elution volume versus the logarithm of molecular mass was carried out using the protein standards, and an apparent mass of 59 kDa was obtained for (CA-CTD)<sub>2</sub>. Analytic ultracentrifugation was used to quantify the oligomerization state of</p>(CA-CTD)<sub>2</sub>. Centrifugation experiment was performed on a Beckman Optima XL- A ultracentrifuge at rotor speed of 22,000 \u03c6m. (CA-CTD)<sub>2</sub> protein was centrifuged at 4\u00b0C in 25 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 100 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTT. Equilibrium distributions were fitted to single homogeneous species assuming a simple dimer model with a fixed protein mass of 35.2 kDa (Figure 12B). The data demonstrate that the dissociation constant for a monomer-dimer equilibrium must be less than K<sub>d</sub> = IO<sup>\"6</sup> M (and probably much less than this).

Example 5 The CA G94D mutant CA-NC protein assembles into longer cylinders than wild type CA-NC</p>Previous in vitro assembly studies have shown that the CA G94D mutant protein forms longer cylinders than wild-type CA (Li et al., 2000). We therefore tested the assembly of both the CA G94D mutant and wild-type CA-NC on a d(TG)<sub>50</sub> template. Reactions were carried overnight at 4\u00b0C under the following conditions: 0.3 mg/ml (9 \u03bcM) of protein, 0.03 mg/ml (1 \u03bcM) of d(TG)<sub>50</sub> (approximately 11 nt/1 protein molecule), 500 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Cylinder formation was measured by light scattering at 312 nm (Abs<sub>312</sub>) (Table 3) and by negatively stained EM (Figure 13).</p>\n Table 3. G94D and wild-type CA-NC assembly.</p>The light scattering signal of the assembly of wild-type CA-NC is significantly higher than that of the G94D mutant. However, EM images show that G94D mutant protein assembled into long cylinders (Figure 13 A) while wild-type CA-NC formed short cylinders that tended to aggregate (Figure 13B). This aggregation explains the higher light scattering signal of wild-type CA-NC compared to the G94D mutant. For cylindrical formation the G94D mutant is prefened, and for aggregation fo"
