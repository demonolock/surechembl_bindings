In some cases, controlled stable release of drug prolongs drug concentration above a minimum therapeutic concentration (i.e., C)  <sub>min</sub> ) Time of (d).

In some embodiments, the otic formulations or compositions described herein increase the residence time of the drug in the inner ear. In some cases, the concentration of the drug in the perilymph is maintained at or about the therapeutic dose for an extended period of time (e.g., 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, or 6 months) after the drug exposure of the drug (e.g., the concentration in the perilymph) reaches steady state. In some embodiments, the otic formulations or compositions described herein increase the bioavailability and/or steady state levels of the drug in the structure of the ear (e.g., in the inner ear and/or the endolymph and/or the perilymph).</p><p id=\"p0825\" num=\"0822\">In some cases, the concentration of drug relative to the binding constant of one or more ear receptors is determined to have biological properties following administration of a controlled release otic formulation or composition (e.g., a formulation comprising a therapeutic agent) described herein PK profile of interest or minimum concentration of active agent required for therapeutic effect. In some cases, the concentration of drug relative to the binding constant of two receptors, such as, for example only, Mineralocorticoid Receptor (MR) and Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR), is correlated with the determination of C following administration of a controlled release otic formulation or composition described herein <sub>min</sub> Or the most biologically significant PK profile. In some cases, for example, a drug first saturates a first receptor (e.g., GR) and then a second receptor (e.g., MR), and there is therapeutic benefit even when the first receptor is saturated but the second receptor is not. In some cases, the concentration of drug that saturates the second receptor is related to C <sub>min</sub> Are substantially the same. In some such cases, for example, when the drug concentration falls below the saturation level of the second receptor and/or C <sub>min</sub> The next dose is administered.</p><p id=\"p0826\" num=\"0823\">The combination of immediate release, delayed release and/or extended release otic compositions or formulations is combined with other pharmaceutical agents as well as excipients, diluents, stabilizers, tonicity agents and other components disclosed herein.
