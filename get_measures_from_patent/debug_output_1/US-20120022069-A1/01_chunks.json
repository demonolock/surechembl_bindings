    "croscope (Nikon, Eclipse E600, Japan) and superfused with a bath solution comprised of BaCl<sub>2 </sub>(11 mM), MgCl<sub>2 </sub>(1.5 mM), HEPES (10 mM), TEA chloride (120 mM), glucose (10 mM) adjusted to pH 7.4 with KOH. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings are made using conventional patch-clamp techniques (NPL31) at room temperature (22-24\u00b0 C.). The patch-clamp pipettes are pulled from WPI, thick-walled borosilicate glass (WPI, Sarasota, Fla.). Currents are recorded using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, Calif.) and leak-subtracted (P/4), low-pass filtered (1 kHz, 4-pole Bessel), digitized (20-50-\u03bcs intervals), and stored using Digidata 1200 B interface and Pclamp8.0/Clampex software (Axon Instruments, Union City, Calif.). The pipettes are back-filled with internal solution containing CsCl (110 mM), MgCl<sub>2 </sub>(3 mM), EGTA (3 mM), HEPES (40 mM), Mg-ATP (4 mM), Na<sub>2</sub>GTP (0.5 mM), and adjusted to pH 7.2 with CsOH. The pipette resistance ranges from 2 to 3 MOhm and is compensated by 75-80% by the built-in electronic circuitry.</p>Currents are elicited by stepping from a holding potential of \u221290 mV to 0 mV for 20 ms every 10 sec. At the \u221290 mV membrane voltage a proportion of channels is in the inactivated state, and thus contact with a blocker would involve interaction with both resting and inactivated channels. This protocol is used as a first tier screen. For dissection of two components of inhibition (resting block with the apparent dissociation constant K<sub>r </sub>and inactivated state block with K<sub>i</sub>), steady-state inactivation curves are collected using a double-pulse protocol. Three-second long depolarizing pre-pulse incrementing in 10 mV steps is followed by a 10 ms test pulse to 0 mV. Stock solutions of each test compound are prepared using DMSO. Serial dilutions to desired concentrations are done with bath solution; concentration of DMSO in final solutions is 0.1%. Drugs are applied by gravity flow using a plane multi-barrel array shooter positioned \u02dc1 mm apart from the cell.</p>All curve fittings can be carried out using Origin software (version 5.0, Microcal). A Hill equation is used to fit the concentration-response curves and to determine IC<sub>50 </sub>values. A Boltzman equation is used to fit inactivation curves, returning half-inactivation voltage, V<sub>0.5</sub>, slope p and the amplitude of current at the most negative voltage where eventually all channels are in the resting state. These parameters are used to calculate the apparent dissociation constants: K<sub>r</sub>=((Ab/Ac)/(1\u2212(Ab/Ac))*{b}) where {b} is the drug concentration, Ac is the maximum test current amplitude in control conditions and Ab is the maximum test current amplitude in the presence of a blocker; ={b}/((exp(\u2212(dx/p))*(1+({b}/K<sub>r</sub>))\u22121) where dx is the difference between half-inactivation voltage V<sub>0.5 </sub>in the presence and absence of drug and p is the slope.</p>In Vivo PharmacologyThe com",
