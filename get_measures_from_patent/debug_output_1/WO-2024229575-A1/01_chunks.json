    "ity compared to single epitope immunoglobin domains. [0147] \u201cNanobodies\u201d are antibody fragments consisting of a single monomeric variable antibody domain. Nanobodies may also be referred to as single-domain antibodies. Like antibodies, nanobodies are capable of binding selectively to a specific antigen. Nanobodies may be heavy-chain variable domains or light chain domains. Nanobodies may occur naturally or be the product of biological engineering. Nanobodies may be biologically engineered by site-directed mutagenesis or mutagenic screening (e.g., phage display, yeast \n\n 92501781 display, bacterial display, mRNA display, ribosome display).\u201cAffibodies\u201d are polypeptides or proteins engineered to bind to a specific antigen. As such, affibodies may be considered to mimic certain functions of antibodies. [0148] Affibodies may be engineered variants of the B-domain in the immunoglobulin- binding region of staphylococcal protein A. Affibodies may be engineered variants of the Z- domain, a B-domain that has lower affinity for the Fab region. Affibodies may be biologically engineered by site-directed mutagenesis or mutagenic screening (e.g., phage display, yeast display, bacterial display, mRNA display, ribosome display). [0149] Affibody molecules showing specific binding to a variety of different proteins (e.g. insulin, fibrinogen, transferrin, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, IL-8, gp120, CD28, human serum albumin, IgA, IgE, IgM, HER2 and EGFR) have been generated, demonstrating affinities (Kd) in the \u03bcM to pM range. \u201cDiabodies\u201d are antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites that may be bivalent or bispecific. See for example Hudson et al., (2003). Single-chain antibodies are antibody fragments comprising all or a portion of the heavy chain variable domain or all, or a portion of the light chain variable domain of an antibody. Antibody fragments can be made by various techniques including but not limited to proteolytic digestion of an intact antibody as well as production by recombinant hosts (e.g., E. coli or phage) as described herein. [0150] In certain embodiments, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof is a multispecific, e.g. bispecific. Multispecific antibodies (or antigen-binding fragments thereof) include monoclonal antibodies (or antigen-binding fragments thereof) that have binding specificities for at least two different sites. [0151] In certain embodiments, amino acid sequence variants of antibodies or antigen- binding fragments thereof are contemplated; e.g., variants that are capable of binding to a target antigen . For example, it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and/or other biological properties of the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof. Amino acid sequence variants of an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof may be prepared by introducing appropriate modifications into the nucleotide sequence encoding the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof, or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications in",
    "arget binding with a unit of 1/time; K<sub>int</sub>, the rate constant of internalization of drug-target complex with a unit of 1/time. The initial conditions can be defined as below: Cp(0) = Dose/Vc, T(t=0) = Ksyn/Kdeg, and CT(t=0) = 0 (11D) [0219] Equations 11A/11B/11C with the initial conditions as defined in 11D can be solved with any ODE solver such as Berkeley Madonna\u00ae, package deSolve of R, or various ODE solvers in MATLAB\u00ae. Hence, their numerical solutions can be obtained accordingly. Once the numerical solution is obtained, T<sub>trans</sub> to achieve C<sub>trans</sub> for any C<sub>max</sub> value (where C<sub>max</sub> is greater than C<sub>trans</sub>) can be determined. [0220] Under certain conditions such as quasi-equilibrium (QE) and quasi-steady state (QSS) conditions, a TMDD model is equivalent to a M-M model for a certain range of plasma concentrations. As a result, V<sub>M</sub> and K<sub>M</sub> of M-M equation can be expressed by the TMDD model parameters. [0221] More specifically, under the QE condition, a TMDD model is equivalent to M-M model; see e.g., Yan et al., 2010; Mager &amp; Krzyzanski, 2005. This equivalence is valid when the following conditions are satisfied: \n\n 92501781 K<sub>int</sub>=K<sub>deg</sub> so that T<sub>tot</sub> = K<sub>syn</sub>/K<sub>deg</sub> is a constant (where T<sub>tot</sub> is total receptor concentration); rapid binding, i.e, K<sub>on</sub> \u00d7 Cp(t) \u00d7 T = K<sub>off</sub> \u00d7 CT is valid, for any time t; Cp<sup>2</sup> ^(Kd ^Ttot) where Kd is the dissociation constant: Kd = Koff/Kon. (Yan et al., 2021). [0222] Under the QE condition, VM and KM can be determined as below: V<sub>M</sub> = K<sub>int</sub> ^T<sub>tot</sub> ^Vc (12) KM = Kd = Koff/Kon (13) where C<sub>trans</sub> is also defined by Equation (5) with V<sub>M</sub> and K<sub>M</sub> defined in Equation (12) and (13). Expressed in an explicit form by TMDD model parameters, Ctrans is determined as below: C \n<img id=\"imgf000051_0001\" path=\"imgf000051_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/1319606183/WO/20241114/A1/002024/22/95/75/imgf000051_0001.tif\"/>\n [0223] Alternatively, under the QSS condition, a TMDD model is also equivalent to M-M model; see e.g., Gibiansky et al., 2008. The equivalence is valid for rapid binding and for Cp<sup>2</sup> ^(K<sub>QSS</sub> ^T<sub>tot</sub>) where K<sub>QSS</sub>=(K<sub>off</sub>+K<sub>int</sub>)/K<sub>on</sub>. It is demonstrated that QSS approximation is preferred over QE when K<sub>int</sub> is not negligible compared to K<sub>off</sub>. [0224] Under the QSS condition, VM and KM can be determined as below: VM = Ksyn ^Vc (15) KM = KQSS =(Koff+Kint)/Kon (16) where C<sub>trans</sub> is also defined by Equation (5) with V<sub>M</sub> and K<sub>M</sub> defined in Equation (15) and (16). Expressed in an explicit form by TMDD model parameters, C<sub>trans</sub> is determined as below: C\n<img id=\"imgf000051_0002\" path=\"imgf000051_0002.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/1319606186/WO/20241114/A1/002024/22/95/75/imgf000051_0002.tif\"/>\n [0225] For typical TMDD model described by Equations 11A/11B/11C/11D, its analytical solution is generally hard to be obtained while its numer",
