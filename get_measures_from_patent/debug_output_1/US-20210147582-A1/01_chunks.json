    " In some embodiments, the fractionated alkylated cyclodextrin can be detected using evaporative light scattering detection. In some embodiments, the fractionated alkylated cyclodextrin can be detected using capillary electrophoresis. In some embodiments, the fractionated alkylated cyclodextrin can be detected using a charged aerosol detector.</p>Methods of Evaluating the Fractionated Alkylated Cyclodextrin CompositionsThe content of the fractionated alkylated cyclodextrin composition can be analyzed using capillary electrophoresis, a charged aerosol detector, mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis. In some embodiments, the content of a fractionated alkylated cyclodextrin composition can be determined using capillary electrophoresis. In some embodiments, the content of a fractionated alkylated cyclodextrin composition can be determined using a charged aerosol detector.</p>Uses of Fractionated Alkylated Cyclodextrin CompositionsBy \u201ccomplexed\u201d is meant \u201cbeing part of a clathrate or inclusion complex with,\u201d i.e., a \u201ccomplexed\u201d therapeutic agent is part of a clathrate or inclusion complex with a fractionated alkylated cyclodextrin. The term \u201cmajor portion\u201d refers to 50% or greater, by weight, on a molar basis. Thus, a formulation as described herein can contain an active agent of which more than about 50% by weight is complexed with a fractionated alkylated cyclodextrin. The actual percentage of active agent that is complexed will vary according to the complexation equilibrium binding constant characterizing the complexation of a specific fractionated alkylated cyclodextrin with a specific active agent. Also included are embodiments wherein the active agent is not complexed with the cyclodextrin or in which only a minor portion of the active agent is complexed with the fractionated alkylated cyclodextrin. It should be noted that a fractionated alkylated cyclodextrin can form one or more ionic bonds with a positively charged compound. This ionic association can occur regardless of whether the positively charged compound is complexed with the cyclodextrin by inclusion complexation.</p>Among other uses, a fractionated alkylated cyclodextrin composition can be used to solubilize and/or stabilize a variety of different materials and to prepare formulations for particular applications. The present fractionated alkylated cyclodextrin composition can provide enhanced solubility and/or enhanced chemical, thermochemical, hydrolytic, and/or photochemical stability of other ingredients in a composition. For example, a fractionated alkylated cyclodextrin composition can be used to stabilize an active agent in an aqueous medium. A fractionated alkylated cyclodextrin composition can also be used to increase the solubility of an active agent in an aqueous medium.</p>The fractionated alkylated cyclodextrin composition can include one or more active agents. The one or more active agents included in the composition can possess a wide range of water solubility, bioava"
