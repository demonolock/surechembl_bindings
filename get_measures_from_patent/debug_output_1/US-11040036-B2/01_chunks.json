The entire contents of the aforementioned priority applications are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>BACKGROUNDPyruvate kinase deficiency (YKD) is a disease of the red blood cells caused by a deficiency of the pyruvate kinase R (PKR) enzyme due to recessive mutations of PKLR gene (Wijk et al. Human Mutation, 2008, 30 (3) 446-453). PKR activators can be beneficial to treat PKD, thalassemia (e.g., beta-thalessemia), hereditary elliptocytosis, abetalipoproteinemia or Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome, sickle cell disease, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, anemia (e.g., congenital anemias (e.g., enzymopathies), hemolytic anemia (e.g. hereditary and/or congenital hemolytic anemia, acquired hemolytic anemia, chronic hemolytic anemia caused by phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency, anemia of chronic diseases, non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia or hereditary spherocytosis).</p>SUMMARYDescribed herein are compounds of Formulas (I), (II), (III), (IV), and (V) (collectively referred to herein as \u201cFormulas (I)-(V)\u201d), that activate pyruvate kinase R (PKR), wild type and/or mutant enzymes (such as those described herein), and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.</p>In one embodiment, the invention provides a compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof:</p><img id=\"EMI-C00002\" path=\"US11040036-20210622-C00002.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/844959688/US/20210622/B2/000011/04/00/36/US11040036-20210622-C00002.TIF\"/>\nwherein R<sup>1</sup>, R<sup>2</sup>, R<sup>a</sup>, R<sup>b</sup>, R<sup>k</sup>, and Q are as defined herein.\n</p>In one embodiment, the compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is selected from the compounds of Table 1 or FIG. 1.</p>Also provided are pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of Formulas (I)-(V), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a pharmaceutically",
    "ical composition comprising a compound disclosed herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In certain embodiments, the hemolytic anemia is hereditary and/or congenital hemolytic anemia, acquired hemolytic anemia, or anemia as part of a multi-system disease. In certain embodiments, the hemolytic anemia is congenital anemia. In certain embodiments, the hemolytic anemia is hereditary (e.g. non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia or hereditary spherocytosis).</p>The present disclosure further provides a method for treating thalassemia (e.g., beta-thalassemia), hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis, abetalipoproteinemia (or Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome), paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, acquired hemolytic anemia (e.g., congenital anemias (e.g., enzymopathies)), sickle cell disease, or anemia of chronic diseases in a subject comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of (1) a compound disclosed herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; (2) a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound disclosed herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In one embodiment, the acquired hemolytic anemia comprises congenital anemias. In certain embodiments, the provided method is to treat thalassemia.
