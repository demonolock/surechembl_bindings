    "on. The c-Met antibody preferably exhibits less than 20% of the maximal HGF effect in this assay system. \n\n The individual c-Met antibodies provided herein are also considered not to exhibit significant intrinsic agonist activity if the agonist effect produced in the absence of HGF is equal to or lower than that obtained with reference antibody c224Gl 1 (as described in WO 2009/007427), which reference antibody is a murine-human chimeric antibody of the IgGl isotype comprising a heavy chain variable domain having the amino acid sequence shown as SEQ ID NO:43 and the light chain variable domain having the amino acid sequence shown as SEQ ID NO:44 and a human constant region which is not hinge- modified, i.e. which comprises the wild-type hinge region of human IgGl . </p> The product combination or composition may comprise isolated antibodies (which may be monoclonal antibodies) having high human homology that specifically bind to a human c-Met receptor protein, wherein the antibodies are strict antagonists of HGF- mediated activation of the c-Met receptor. The properties and characteristics of the c-Met antibodies, and antigen-binding regions, which may be included in the product combination or composition or multispecific antibodies according to the invention will now be described in further detail. c-Met binding and affinity </p> Isolated antibodies having high human homology that specifically bind to a human c-Met receptor protein will typically exhibit a binding affinity (KD) for human c- Met, and more particuarly the extracellular domain of human c-Met, of about \u0399\u039f\u03b7\u039c or less, or InM or less, or O. lnM or less, or lOpM or less, and may exhibit a dissociation off- rate for human c-Met binding of 10<sup>'</sup>V<sup>1</sup> or less, or 10<sup>'</sup>V<sup>1</sup> or less. Binding affinity (K<sub>D</sub>) and dissociation rate (k<sub>0ff</sub>) can be measured using standard techniques well known to persons skilled in the art, such as for example surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore), as described in the accompanying examples. </p> The c-Met antibodies described herein exhibit immunological specificity for binding to human c-Met, and more specifically the extracellular domain of human c-Met, but cross -reactivity with non-human homologues of c-Met is not excluded. The binding affinity exhibited with non-human primate homologues of c-Met (e.g. rhesus macaque c- Met) is typically 1- 10, e.g. 5-10, fold lower than the binding affinity for human c-Met. \n\n Antagonist/agonist properties </p> As described elsewhere, the individual c-Met antibodies provided herein, and also combinations of two or more such antibodies (or antigen-binding regions derived from them), and the multispecific antibody described herein, may be \"strict antagonists\" of HGF-mediated activation of the human c-Met receptor, according to the definition given above. The individual c-Met antibodies, and also combinations of two or more such antibodies (or antigen-binding regions derived f",

Rhesus ECD was immobilized in PBS (1 \u03bcg/ml) on a 96-well maxisorb plate and incubated at 4\u00b0C over night. After blocking with 1% casein in PBS, the antibodies in dilutions starting with 10 \u03bcg/ml were added and allowed to bind for 1 h at room temperature. The plate was washed and a goat anti-human Fey antibody (Jackson) was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, TMB was added and the plate read at 620 nm. </p> Since the mouse c-Met also contained a Fc portion, the mAbs (2 \u03bcg/ml) were immobilized on a 96 well maxisorb plate over night at 4\u00b0C and, after blocking, 100 ng/ml of the mouse c-Met was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. An HRP conjugated mouse anti-His antibody (Serotech) was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, TMB was added and the plate read at 620 nm. A biotinylated goat anti-mouse c-Met antibody revealed with strep-HRP was used as a positive control for the mouse c-Met. </p> No significant binding (&gt;10-fold) to mouse c-Met was observed for any of the mAbs. </p> All six mAbs tested showed cross-reactivity to Rhesus c-Met ECD with an almost identical binding compared to that on the human ECD c-Met (Decoy) (Table 9). </p>Table 9.

Five \u03bcg/ml mouse anti-His antibodies (Serotech) was immobilized on a maxisorb plate and, after blocking with 1% casein in PBS for 2 h, 100 ng/ml recombinant dimeric c-Met was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, dilutions of the antibodies were added and allowed to bind to the captured c-Met for 30 minutes, before 25 ng/ml N-terminally biotinylated HGF (R&amp;D systems, 294-HGN/CF) was added. Biotinylated HGF was incubated at room temperature for 1 h before washing. Horseradish-conjugated streptavidin (strep-HRP) was added and incubated for an additional hour. TMB was added and the plate read at 620 nm. An isotype control (hlgGl ) was included as a control as well as murine 5D5 antibody. Competition was expressed as percentage competition as compared to the controls (strep-HRP only or hlgGl ) and plotted against the concentration of antibodies. An IC<sub>5</sub>0 was calculated using GraphPad Prism (Table 10). Antibodies 13E6 and 20A11 only displaced HGF partially (about 50%), which may be related to the epitope these two mAbs recognize on the c-Met. Figure 6 shows an example of anti-c-Met antibodies competing with HGF for c-Met binding. </p>Table 10: IC<sub>5</sub>0 of mAbs competing with HGF for c-Met binding mAbs IC50 (nM) </p> 12G4 0.26 </p> 13E6 partial </p> 20F1 0.36 \n\n Example 7: Agonistic and antagonistic properties of mAbs measured in the proliferation assay using HGF-dependent pancreatic BxPC3 cells. </p> Human pancreatic BxPC3 cells (ATCC cat no.CRL-1687) respond to HGF and were used for the proliferation assay to investigate the eight candidate mAbs further. In brief, 15,000 cells were seeded in the presence of serum and then serum starved over night following attachment (4-6 hours after seeding). The mAbs were added in doses from 20 ng/ml to 40 \u03bcg/ml in the presence or absence of 75 ng/ml HGF in order to test antagonism and agonism respectively. After three days incubation, Alamar blue was added to the cells and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 4 hours before reading fluorescence at excitation 550 nm and emission 590 nm, thereby yielding a read-out on cell proliferation. The assay was repeated three times. An example of one independently performed experiment for agonism (Figure 7 A) and one for antagonism (Figure 7B) is shown for the candidate mAbs and benchmark mAbs, including chimeric 224G11 (c224Gl l, Pierre Fabre). Proliferation is expressed as a percentage of the proliferation obtained with 75 ng/ml HGF. Three of the mAbs (38H10, 40B8 and 36C4) show less than 20% induced proliferation, with 38H10 in the same range as the benchmark c224Gl 1. </p>Example 8: VL shuffling for improved affinity. </p> VL chain shuffling was used to improve the affinity of the two mAbs, 38H10 and 48A2.

    "54E and 53E2-54E as compared to the parental 36C4. The germlined variants 53E3 and53Al l showed the same \n\n results. The antagonistic effect of the germlined mAbs were not significantly altered either as shown in Figure 20B, exemplified by 55A12-54E and 53E2-54E. </p>Example 23: PBS stability of germlined 36C4 mAbs. </p> Stability of 3 mg/ml IgG in PBS +0.02% Tween-80 was investigated at days 0-1-</p>7-14-28-56 after storage at 4\u00b0C, RT and 37\u00b0C. All samples were tested for their potency by Surface Plasmon Resonance investigating binding to coupled c-Met (15,000-17,000 RU) and determining the slope between 100-130 seconds at a flow rate of 30 \u03bc\u0390/min. The percentage of functional mAbs was calculated based on the reference (germlined mAbs stored at -20\u00b0C). Figure 21 shows that there was not significant loss of functionality after 56 days incubation at the different temperatures and there did not seem to be a significant difference between the four germlined mAbs. </p>Example 24: Thermotolerance of germlined 36C4 and 48A2 mAbs. </p> The thermotolerance of germlined 36C4 and 48A2 mAbs was investigated by incubation at different temperatures for 1 h before the samples (0.5 \u03bcg/ml) were run on CM-5 chip coupled with 15,000-17,000 RU Decoy c-Met and the slope determining the slope between 100-130 seconds at a flow rate of 30 \u03bc\u0390/min. The percentage of functional mAbs was calculated based on the reference (incubated at 4\u00b0C) set to 100%. As shown in Figure 22A, the melting temperatures (EC50) of the germlined mAbs was 67.2\u00b0C for 36C4, 67.1\u00b0C for 55A12-54E, 66.1\u00b0C for 53E2-54E, 68.2\u00b0C for 53E3 and 65.5\u00b0C for 53 A 11. For 48 A2, germlined mAb 56F3, there was a significant improvement in melting temperature from 65.4 to 71.1\u00b0C (Figure 22B). Example 25: Determination of c-Met peptide binding sites of mAbs 36C4 and 48A2 using human-llama chimeric c-Met </p> To further define the amino acid (aa) stretches of c-Met to which the mAbs 36C4 and 48A2 were binding, chimeric c-Met constructs containing approximately 20-300 aa exchanges from human to llama c-Met were prepared using PCR amplifications and ligations into the human c-Met containing vector with a Flag and a strep tag. Figure 23A shows the chimeric c-Met constructs used for peptide mapping of 36C4 binding to the \n\n SEMA domain, whereas Figure 23B show the chimeric c-Met constructs for the peptide mapping of 48 A2 binding to the PSI-IPT1 domain. </p> The llama-human c-Met chimeras were produced in HEK293E cells and purified using strep-tactin sepharose HP (2-3 h at 11\u00b0C) before washing of unbound proteins. The bound proteins were eluted with 2.5 mM desthiobiotin pH 8.2 and fractions of 1.5 ml were collected. Protein concentration was determined by Nanodrop. Protein was quality controlled by SDS-PAGE. </p> An ELISA was run to investigate the binding of the mAbs to the different chimeras. 2 \u03bcg/ml 36C4 or 48A2 were immobilized and, after blocking, the c-Met chimeras were added and revealed with 1/10,000 streptavid"
