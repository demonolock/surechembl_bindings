    "ptor, transfected CHO-K1 cell membranes and [<sup>3</sup>H]-DAMGO (Perkin Elmer, ES-542-C), as the radioligand, were used. The assay was carried out with 20 g of membrane suspension, 1 nM of [<sup>3</sup>H]-DAMGO in either absence or presence of either buffer or 10 \u03bc\u039c Naloxone for total and non-specific binding, respectively. Binding buffer contained Tris-HCI 50 mM, MgCI2 5 mM at pH 7.4. Plates were incubated at 27\u00b0C for 60 minutes. After the incubation period, the reaction mix was then transferred to Multiscreen HTS, FC plates (Millipore), filtered and plates were washed 3 times with ice-cold 10 mM Tris-HCL (pH 7.4). Filters were dried and counted at approximately 40% efficiency in a MicroBeta scintillation counter (Perkin-Elmer) using EcoScint liquid scintillation cocktail. </p>Results: </p>As this invention is aimed at providing a compound or a chemically related series of compounds which act as dual ligands of the \u03c3\u03b9 receptor and the \u03bc-opiod receptor it is a very preferred embodiment in which the compounds are selected which act as dual ligands of the \u03c3 receptor and the \u03bc-opiod receptor and especially compounds which have a binding expressed as Kj which is preferably &lt; 1000 nM for both receptors, more preferably &lt; 500 nM, even more preferably &lt; 100 nM. </p>The following scale as been adopted for representing the binding to the the a receptor and the \u03bc-opiod receptor expressed as K,: </p>+ Both \u039a,-\u03bc and \u039a,-\u03c3\u03b9 &gt;= 500 nM </p> ++ One K| &lt;500 nM while the other Ki is &gt;=500 nM </p> +++ Both \u039a<sub>\u0393</sub>\u03bc and \u039a<sub>\u0393</sub>\u03c3\u00b7, &lt; 500 nM </p> ++++ Both \u039a<sub>\u0393</sub>\u03bc and &lt; 100 nM </p>All compounds prepared in the present application exhibit binding to the \u03c3-<sub>\\</sub> receptor and the \u03bc-opiod receptor, in particular the following binding results are shown: \n\n\u03b9 dual binding</p>++++ </p> + </p> + </p> ++++</p>+++</p>+++</p>+++</p>++ </p> ++ </p> ++ </p> ++ </p> +++</p>+++</p>+++</p>++++</p>++ </p> +++</p>++++</p>+++</p>+++</p>+++</p>+++</p>++ </p> +++</p>+++</p>+++</p>++ </p> +++</p>++ </p> ++ </p> +++</p>++++ \n\n +++</p>+</p>+++</p>+++</p>+++</p>+++</p>++</p>+</p>+</p>+++</p>+++</p>++++</p>+++</p>++</p>+++</p>++</p>++</p>+++</p>++</p>+++</p>+++ \n</p>"
