{"raw_mentions": "As this invention is aimed at providing a compound or a chemically related series of compounds which act as dual ligands of the \u03c3\u03b9 receptor and the \u03bc-opiod receptor it is a very preferred embodiment in which the compounds are selected which act as dual ligands of the \u03c3 receptor and the \u03bc-opiod receptor and especially compounds which have a binding expressed as Kj which is preferably &lt; 1000 nM for both receptors, more preferably &lt; 500 nM, even more preferably &lt; 100 nM. \nThe assay was carried out with 20 g of membrane suspension, 1 nM of [<sup>3</sup>H]-DAMGO in either absence or presence of either buffer or 10 \u03bc\u039c Naloxone for total and non-specific binding, respectively."}
