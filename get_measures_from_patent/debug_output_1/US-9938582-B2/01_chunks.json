    " KRAS loci and fusion of UBE2L3 to KRAS. (C) Representative FISH results on a UBE2L3-KRAS positive tissue highlighting the negative findings.</p>FIG. 25 shows qPCR confirmation of siRNA knockdown and ectopic expression of UBE2L3-KRAS fusion. (A) qPCR confirmation of UBE2L3-KRAS knockdown by siRNA against the fusion junction, wild-type UBE2L3, and wild-type KRAS on DU145. (B-C), qPCR confirmation of NIH 3T3 and RWPE cells expressing UBE2L3-KRAS fusion. NIH 3T3 cells (B) were transfected with the empty pDEST40 vector or the UBE2L3-KRAS fusion. RWPE cells (C) were transfected with lentiviral particles harboring the empty pLenti-6 vector or UBE2L3-KRAS fusion.</p>FIG. 26 shows NIH 3T3 fibroblasts expressing the UBE2L3-KRAS fusion lost normal fibroblast morphology in contrast to the pDEST40 vector control.</p>FIG. 27 shows a comparison of the foci density of NIH 3T3 cells expressing the UBE2L3-KRAS fusion or pDEST40 vector.</p>FIG. 28 shows that NIH 3T3 cells expressing the UBE2L3-KRAS fusion show an increase in the S phase.</p>FIG. 29 shows a schematic of Ras signaling pathways.</p>FIG. 30 shows photographs and pathology of NIH 3T3 xenograft models. (A) The photographs of the mice bearing the NIH 3T3 xenograft tumors expressing UBE2L3-KRAS fusion (upper) and the pDEST40, vector (lower). (B) The pathology of NIH 3T3 xenograft tissues. Left panel, xenograft tissues excised from NIH 3T3 fusion expressing tumor bearing mice were stained using hematoxylin and eosin (HE). Right panel, Ki-67 immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of xenograft tissues showing 98% of tumor nuclei (upper) versus 17% of control tissue nuclei (lower) are positive for Ki-67.</p>DEFINITIONSTo facilitate an understanding of the present invention, a number of terms and phrases are defined below:</p>As used herein, the term \u201cgene fusion\u201d refers to a chimeric genomic DNA, a chimeric messenger RNA, a truncated protein or a chimeric protein resulting from the fusion of at least a portion of a first gene to at least a portion of a second gene. The gene fusion need not include entire genes or exons of genes.</p>As used herein, the term \u201cgene upregulated in cancer\u201d refers to a gene that is expressed (e.g., mRNA or protein expression) at a higher level in cancer (e.g., prostate cancer) relative to the level in other tissues. In some embodiments, genes upregulated in cancer are expressed at a level at least 10%, preferably at least 25%, even more preferably at least 50%, still more preferably at least 100%, yet more preferably at least 200%, and most preferably at least 300% higher than the level of expression in other tissues. In some embodiments, genes upregulated in prostate cancer are \u201candrogen regulated genes.\u201d</p>As used herein, the term \u201cgene upregulated in prostate tissue\u201d refers to a gene that is expressed (e.g., mRNA or protein expression) at a higher level in prostate tissue relative to the level in other tissue.
