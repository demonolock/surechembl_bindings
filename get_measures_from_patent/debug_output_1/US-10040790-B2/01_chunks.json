    "tion containing biotinylated EQEDEPEGDYFEWLE peptide substrate (SEQ ID NO: 1) and ATP (final concentrations of 500 nM and 140 \u03bcM respectively) in assay buffer to the wells. The plate was incubated at 25\u00b0 C. for 1 hr. The reactions were ended with the addition of 10 \u03bcL/well of quench solution (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mg/mL BSA, pH 7.8; 30 mM EDTA with Perkin Elmer Lance Reagents at 3.75 nM Eu-antibody PY20 and 180 nM APC-Streptavidin). The plate was allowed to equilibrate for \u02dc1 hr before scanning the wells on a PheraStar plate reader (BMG Labtech).</p>FGFR1 and FGFR2 were measured under equivalent conditions with the following changes in enzyme and ATP concentrations: FGFR1, 0.02 nM and 210 \u03bcM, respectively and FGFR2, 0.01 nM and 100 \u03bcM, respectively. The enzymes were purchased from Millipore or Invitrogen.</p>GraphPad prism3 was used to analyze the data. The IC<sub>50 </sub>values were derived by fitting the data to the equation for a sigmoidal dose-response with a variable slope. Y=Bottom+(Top\u2212Bottom)/(1+10^((Log IC<sub>50</sub>\u2212X)*HillSlope)) where X is the logarithm of concentration and Y is the response. Compounds having an IC<sub>50 </sub>of 1 \u03bcM or less are considered active.</p>The compounds of the invention were found to be inhibitors of one or more of FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 according to the above-described assay. IC<sub>50 </sub>data is provided below in Table 1. The symbol \u201c+\u201d indicates an IC<sub>50 </sub>less than 100 nM.</p>TABLE 1FGFR1FGFR2FGFR3Example No.IC50 (nM)IC50 (nM)IC50 (nM)1+++2+++3+++4+++5+++6+++7+++8+++9+++10+++11+++12+++13+++14+++15+++16+++17+++18+++19+++20+++21+++22+++23+++24+++25+++26+++27+++28+++29+++30+++31+++32+++33+++34+++35+++36+++37+++38+++39+++40+++41+++42+++43+++44+++45+++46+++47+++48+++49+++50+++51+++52+++53+++54+++</p>Example BFGFR Cell Proliferation/Survival Assays</p>The ability of the example compounds to inhibit the growth of cells dependent on FGFR signaling for survival can be measured using viability assays. A recombinant cell line over-expressing human FGFR3 was developed by stable transfection of the mouse pro-B Ba/F3 cells (obtained from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen) with a plasmid encoding the full length human FGFR3. Cells were sequentially selected for puromycin resistance and proliferation in the presence of heparin and FGF1. A single cell clone was isolated and characterized for functional expression of FGFR3. This Ba/F<sub>3</sub>-FGFR3 clone is used in cell proliferation assays, and compounds are screened for their ability to inhibit cell proliferation/survival. The Ba/F<sub>3</sub>-FGFR3 cells are seeded into 96 well, black cell culture plates at 3500 cells/well in RPMI1640 media containing 2% FBS, 20 ug/mL Heparin and 5 ng/mL FGF1. The cells were treated with 10 \u03bcL of 10\u00d7 concentrations of serially diluted compounds (diluted with medium lacking serum from 5 mM DSMO dots) to a final volume of 100 \u03bcL/well. After 72 hour incubation, 100 \u03bcL of Cell Titer Glo\u00ae reagent (Promega "
