{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences/rows that meet the criteria:\n\n\nFGFR1 and FGFR2 were measured under equivalent conditions with the following changes in enzyme and ATP concentrations: FGFR1, 0.02 nM and 210 \u03bcM, respectively and FGFR2, 0.01 nM and 100 \u03bcM, respectively.\nCompounds having an IC50 of 1 \u03bcM or less are considered active.\nThe symbol \u201c+\u201d indicates an IC50 less than 100 nM.\nTABLE 1 does not provide specific numeric values, so it is not included, but the following sentence provides context: The compounds of the invention were found to be inhibitors of one or more of FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 according to the above-described assay, with IC50 data provided below in Table 1."}
