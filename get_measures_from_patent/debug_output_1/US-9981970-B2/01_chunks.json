    " 20 nM rCETP, 2% human serum, and 1\u00d7CETP buffer. 1 \u03bcL of each test compound diluted in DMSO is added to 47 \u03bcL of assay cocktail per well and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 1 hour. To initiate the transfer reaction, 2 \u03bcL radiolabeled LDL is added. After an additional 60 min of incubation at 37\u00b0 C., the transfer action is terminated by precipitation of LDL with an equal volume of 20% WN PEG 8000. The plates are centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. A 40 \u03bcL aliquot of the HDL-containing supernatant is transferred to a Packard Optiplate\u2122 with 200 \u03bcL of MicroScint\u2122 20. After mixing, plates are counted by liquid scintillation. Counts present in the supernatant for blanks (wells containing only HDL acceptor, CETP buffer and DMSO) are subtracted from those containing test compounds and used to correct for non-specific transfer.</p>For the transfer assay using endogenous CETP from serum (95% RTA), the same procedure is used except that human serum is added such that a final concentration of serum of 95% of the total assay volume is achieved, yielding a concentration of approximately 15 nM endogenous CETP in the assay. This is then combined with HDL and CETP buffer and the reaction proceeds as above and is terminated as described.</p>Comparison of the counts of samples with inhibitors to an uninhibited (DMSO only) positive control yield a percent inhibition. A plot of percent inhibition vs. log of inhibitor concentration, fit to a Sigmoidal 4 parameter equation is used to calculate IC50.</p>EXAMPLESThe following schemes and examples are provided so that the invention will be more fully appreciated and understood.

Lett., 2003, 44, 2081-2082). It was treated with (3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)lithium generated in situ to give the desired ketone intermediate. Reductive amination, followed by removal of the Boc group and cyclization gave Intermediate A1. Intermediate A1 was alkylated to give Intermediate A2. Alternatively, diamine 7 was treated with sulfuric diamide in pyridine to give A5.</p><img id=\"EMI-C00005\" path=\"US09981970-20180529-C00005.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/438348770/US/20180529/B2/000009/98/19/70/US09981970-20180529-C00005.TIF\"/></p>((1R,5S,7aS)-1-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-5-(2-chloro-5-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)tetrahydro-1H-pyrrolo[1,2-c]imidazol-3(2H)-oneStep 1:</p>To a 50"
