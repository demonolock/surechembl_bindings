    "\u201cGCR2\u201d should be considered synonyms. In general, unless the context requires otherwise, the term \u201cFragilis\u201d should be taken to refer to any member of the Fragilis family, including Fragilis itself, Fragilis 9-27, Fragilis 2, Fragilis 3, Fragilis 4, Fragilis 5 and Fragilis 6. In addition, Ifitm1, Ifitm2, Ifitm3 and ENSG142056 are preferably included within the term \u201cFragilis\u201d. Preferably, the Stella and Fragilis sequences disclosed are derived from higher animals, for example primates, in particular, Homo sapiens (man).</p>In preferred embodiments, therefore, Fragilis should be taken to refer to the human nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 5, or the human amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 6, as the context requires. Furthermore, in preferred embodiments, Stella should be taken to refer to the human nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 3, or the human amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 4, as the context requires.</p>Human Stella and Fragilis are related by homology and function to the mouse Stella and Fragilis sequences disclosed in PCT/GB02/00215, and also set out as SEQ ID NO: 1 and SEQ ID NO: 2 in this document. Fragilis and Stella are PGC-specific transcripts. Fragilis is upregulated during the process of lineage commitment of PGCs, while Stella is upregulated after Fragilis, and marks commitment to the PGC fate.</p>Human Fragilis (also known as Germ cell restricted-1, GCR1), encodes a 132 amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of 14.5 kD. A best fit model of the EMBL program PredictProtein predicts two transmembrane domains, both N and C terminus ends being located outside. A BLASTP search revealed that Fragilis is a novel member of the interferon-inducible protein family. One prototype member, human 9-27 (identical to Leu-13 antigen), is inducible by interferon in leukocytes and endothelial cells, and is located at the cell surface as a component of a multimeric complex involved in the transduction of antiproliferative and homotypic adhesion signals (Deblandre, 1995). The BLASTN search revealed that the Fragilis sequence was found in ESTs derived from many different tissues both from embryos and adults, indicating that Fragilis may play a common role in different developmental and cell biological contexts, including cancer; this is described in further detail below. Database searches reveal a sequence match with the rat interferon-inducible protein (sp:INIB RAT, pir:JC1241) with unknown function. The Fragilis sequence appears several times in our screen, indicating high level expression in PGCs.</p>The second gene, human Stella, (Stella) encodes a 159 amino acid protein, of 17.5 kD. It has no sequence homology with any known protein, apart from murine and rodent Stella, contains several nuclear localisation consensus sequences and is highly basic pI, indicating a possible affinity to DNA. Furthermore a potential nuclear export signal is identified, indicating that Stella may shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. BLASTN analysis reveals that the Stella sequence is found only in the preimplantation embryo and germ line (newborn ovary, female 12.5 mesonephros and gonad etc.) ESTs indicating its predominant expression in totipotent and pluripotent cells. Interestingly, we found that Stella contains in its N terminus a modular domain which has some sequence similarity with the SAP motif. This motif is a putative DNA-binding domain involved in chromosomal orgainisation. Furthermore, the SMART program reveals the presence of a splicing factor motif-like structure in its C-terminus, These findings indicate a possible involvement of Stella in chromosomal organisation and RNA processing.</p>Antibodies may be raised against the Fragilis and/or Stella polypeptides. In particular, antibodies may be raised against the extracellular domain of Fragilis, which is a transmembrane polypeptide.</p>Antibodies, polypeptides and nucleic acids disclosed here are useful for the identification of PGCs in cell populations. The methods and compositions described here therefore provide a means to isolate PGCs, useful for example for the study of germ tissue development ",
    "ion of the tandem gene as well.</p>Alternatively, host cells which contain the nucleic acid sequence encoding Stella and/or Fragilis and express Stella and/or Fragilis may be identified by a variety of procedures known to those of skill in the art. These procedures include, but are not limited to, DNA--DNA or DNA-RNA hybridizations and protein bioassay or immunoassay techniques which include membrane, solution, or chip based technologies for the detection and/or quantification of nucleic acid or protein sequences.</p>The presence of polynucleotide sequences encoding Stella and/or Fragilis can be detected by DNA-DNA or DNA-RNA hybridization or amplification using probes or fragments or fragments of polynucleotides encoding Stella and/or Fragilis. Nucleic acid amplification based assays involve the use of oligonucleotides or oligomers based on the sequences encoding Stella and/or Fragilis to detect transformants containing DNA or RNA encoding Stella and/or Fragilis. </p>A variety of protocols for detecting and measuring the expression of Stella and/or Fragilis, using either polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies specific for the protein, are known in the art. Examples of such techniques include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), radioimmunoassays (RIAs), and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). A two-site, monoclonal-based immunoassay utilizing monoclonal antibodies reactive to two non-interfering epitopes on Stella and/or Fragilis is preferred, but a competitive binding assay may be employed. These and other assays are well described in the art, for example, in Hampton, R. et al. (1990; Serological Methods, a Laboratory Manual, Section IV, APS Press, St Paul, Minn.) and in Maddox, D. E. et al. (1983; J. Exp. Med. 158:1211-1216).</p>A wide variety of labels and conjugation techniques are known by those skilled in the art and may be used in various nucleic acid and amino acid assays. Means for producing labeled hybridization or PCR probes for detecting sequences related to polynucleotides encoding Stella and/or Fragilis include oligolabeling, nick translation, end-labeling, or PCR amplification using a labeled nucleotide. Alternatively, the sequences encoding Stella and/or Fragilis, or any fragments thereof, may be cloned into a vector for the production of an mRNA probe. Such vectors are known in the art, are commercially available, and may be used to synthesize RNA probes in vitro by addition of an appropriate RNA polymerase such as T7, T3, or SP6 and labeled nucleotides. These procedures may be conducted using a variety of commercially available kits, such as those provided by Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn (Kalamazoo, Mich.), Promega (Madison, Wis.), and U.S. Biochemical Corp. (Cleveland, Ohio). Suitable reporter molecules or labels which may be used for ease of detection include radionuclides, enzymes, fluorescent, chemiluminescent, or chromogenic agents, as well as substrates, cofactors, inhibitors, magnetic particles, and the like.</p>H"
