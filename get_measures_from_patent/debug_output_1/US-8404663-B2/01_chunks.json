(3 aminopropyl)phosphonic acid (77 mg, 0.55 mmol) was added followed by tert-butyl ammonium hydroxide (0.55 ml, 1.0 M in MeOH). The reaction mixture was stirred for 30 minutes until it became a clear solution. Sodium cyano borohydride (35 mgs, 0.55 mmol) was added and the reaction was stirred at 50\u00b0 C. for 3 hours. Then the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and silica gel was added concentrated to dryness, and then purified on a column (MPLC) using CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>:MeOH and gave Compound 23 (54 mg).</p><sup>1</sup>H NMR (CD<sub>3</sub>OD, 300 MHz) \u03b4: 7.31-7.44 (m, 4H), 7.25 (td, J=7.9, 6.2 Hz, 1H), 6.81-7.06 (m, 5H), 6.75-6.81 (m, 1H), 6.40-6.53 (m, 1H), 6.19-6.34 (m, 1H), 4.04 (s, 2H), 3.72 (d, J=7.9 Hz, 1H), 2.90-3.10 (m, 4H), 2.14 (s, 6H), 1.95 (ddd, J=17.8, 6.9, 6.7 Hz, 2H), 1.56-1.76 (m, 3H).</p>Biological DataCompounds were synthesized and tested for S1P1 activity using the GTP \u03b3<sup>35</sup>S binding assay. These compounds may be assessed for their ability to activate or block activation of the human S1P1 receptor in cells stably expressing the S1P1 receptor.</p>GTP \u03b3<sup>35</sup>S binding was measured in the medium containing (mM) HEPES 25, pH 7.4, MgCl<sub>2 </sub>10, NaCl 100, dithitothreitol 0.5, digitonin 0.003%, 0.2 nM GTP \u03b3<sup>35</sup>S, and 5 \u03bcg membrane protein in a volume of 150 \u03bcl. Test compounds were included in the concentration range from 0.08 to 5,000 nM unless indicated otherwise. Membranes were incubated with 100 \u03bcM 5\u2032-adenylylimmidodiphosphate for 30 min, and subsequently with 10 \u03bcM GDP for 10 min on ice. Drug solutions and membrane were mixed, and then reactions were initiated by adding GTP \u03b3<sup>35</sup>S and continued for 30 min at 25\u00b0 C. Reaction mixtures were filtered over Whatman GF/B filters under vacuum, and washed three times with 3 mL of ice-cold buffer (HEPES 25, pH7.4, MgCl<sub>2 </sub>10 and NaCl 100). Filters were dried and mixed with scintillant, and counted for <sup>35</sup>S activity using a n-counter. Agonist-induced GTP \u03b3<sup>35</sup>S binding was obtained by subtracting that in the absence of agonist. Binding data were analyzed using a non-linear regression method. In case of antagonist assay, the reaction mixture contained 10 nM S1P in the presence of test antagonist at concentrations ranging from 0.08 to 5000 nM.</p>Table 7 shows activity potency: S1P1 receptor from GTP \u03b3<sup>35</sup>S: nM, (EC<sub>50</sub>)</p>Activity pot"
