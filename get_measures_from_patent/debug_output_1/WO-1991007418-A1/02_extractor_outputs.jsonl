{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences/rows that meet the criteria:\n\n* Fifty percent inhibition of AlO mAb binding by the yeast-derived Fab occurred at a concentration of about 1 \u03bcg/ml (Table 3), about the same concentration at which AlO mouse mAb showed \u03b40% inhibition.\n* The combined Fab fractions were concentrated over a YM10 membrane to an Fab concentration of about 1 mg/ml, and stored frozen.\n* The E. coli-derived chimeric AlO Fab inhibited binding of radiolabeled mouse AlO mAb to the human tumor cell line LS174T at a concentration of about 1 \u03bcg/ml. \n\nNote that there are limited relevant sentences in the provided text snippet. If more text is available, I may be able to extract additional relevant sentences."}
