    "sodium phosphate is added to adjust pH to 6.8, and the sample is concentrated over a YM10 membrane (Stirred Cell 2000, Amicon). The sample was then diluted with sufficient water and reconcentrated to 200ml to give a conductivity of l.lmS/cm. The total amount of protein was estimated by a colorimetric assay, and the sample was loaded onto a carboxy ethylcellulose type (CM52, Whatman) column at a ratio of lOmg total protein per lg CM\u03b42 (pre-equilibrated with lOmM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.8). The CM\u03b42 column was eluted with a linear gradient of increasing NaCl concentration \n\n(0-0.IN) in the same phosphate buffer. The fractions containing Fab (as assessed by ELISA) were further analyzed by SDS-PAGE and then pooled. The combined Fab fractions were concentrated over a YM10 membrane to an Fab concentration of about 1 mg/ml, and stored frozen.</p>The AlO Fab purified from E. coli has identical molecular weight properties as other Fab molecules produced from E. coli, as assessed by SDS gel electrophoresis. The bacterially-produced AlO Fab is correctly assembled as a K + Fd chain di er because of its positive reaction in the ELISA which detects molecules with both K and Fd determinants, and because it reacts with antigen positive cell lines.</p>7. Binding Characteristics of Fab Protein Secreted by E. coli</p>The E. coli AlO Fab was shown to bind to antigen positive cell by performing direct and competition binding assays with the human carcinoma cell line LS174T. In the direct binding assay, Fab bound to the same target cancer cells as did mouse AlO antibody, but not to a control cell line which lacks the antigen. In the competition assay using <sup>125</sup>I - labeled mouse AlO antibody, the E. coli-derived chimeric AlO Fab inhibited binding of radiolabeled mouse AlO mAb to the human tumor cell line LS174T. Fifty percent inhibition of AlO mAb binding by the yeast-derived Fab occurred at a concentration of about 1 \u03bcg/ml (Table 3), about the same concentration at which AlO mouse mAb showed \u03b40% inhibition. Yeast derived AlO Fab inhibited the binding of mouse AlO antibody and mouse AlO Fab to LS174T tumor cells. THe mouse Fab was prepared by papain digestion of mouse whole 939 antibody. \n\n</p>Table 3.
