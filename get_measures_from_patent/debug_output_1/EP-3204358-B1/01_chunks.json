The primary kinetic isotope effect is a change of the rate for a chemical reaction that results from exchange of isotopic nuclei, which in turn is caused by the change in ground state energies necessary for covalent bond formation after this isotopic exchange. Exchange of a heavier isotope usually results in a lowering of the ground state energy for a chemical bond and thus causes a reduction in the rate-limiting bond breakage. If the bond breakage occurs in or in the vicinity of a saddle-point region along the coordinate of a multi-product reaction, the product distribution ratios can be altered substantially. For explanation: if deuterium is bonded to a carbon atom at a non-exchangeable position, rate differences of kM/kD = 2-7 are typical. If this rate difference is successfully applied to Compound 1, the profile of this compound in vivo can be drastically modified and result in improved pharmacokinetic properties. For a further discussion, see S. L. Harbeson and R. D. Tung, Deuterium In Drug Discovery and Development, Ann. Rep. Med. Chem. 2011, 46, 403-417.</p>When discovering and developing therapeutic agents, a person skilled in the art attempts to optimize pharmacokinetic parameters while retaining desirable in vitro properties. It is reasonable to assume that many compounds with poor pharmacokinetic profiles are susceptible to oxidative metabolism. In vitro liver microsomal assays currently available provide valuable information on the course of oxidative metabolism of this type, which in turn permits the rational design of deuterated compounds of Compound 1 with improved stability through resistance to such oxidative metabolism. Significant improvements in the pharmacokinetic profiles of Compound 1 are thereby obtained and can be expressed quantitatively in terms of\nincreases in the in vivo half-life (tl/2), concentration at maximum therapeutic effect (Cmax), area under the dose response curve (AUC), and bioavailability; and in terms of reduced clearance, dose and materials costs.</p>For example, in one alternative embodiment, at least one hydrogen atoms in Compound 1 are replaced by deuterium atoms to provide a deuterated compound. In one alternative embodiment, one or both of the t",
    "m membrane patches containing \u2264 2 active channels. The maximum number of simultaneous openings determined the number of active channels during the course of an experiment. To determine the single-channel current amplitude, the data recorded from 120 sec of \u0394F508-CFTR activity was filtered \"off-line\" at 100 Hz and then used to construct all-point amplitude histograms that were fitted with multigaussian functions using Bio-Patch Analysis software (Bio-Logic Comp. France). The total microscopic current and open probability (P<sub>o</sub>) were determined from 120 sec of channel activity. The P<sub>o</sub> was determined using the Bio-Patch software or from the relationship P<sub>o</sub> = I/i(N), where I = mean current, i = single-channel current amplitude, and N = number of active channels in patch.</p>Cell CultureNIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing \u0394F508-CFTR are used for excised-membrane patch-clamp recordings. The cells are maintained at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 90 % humidity in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 10 % fetal bovine serum, 1 X NEAA, \u03b2-ME, 1 X pen/strep, and 25 mM HEPES in 175 cm<sup>2</sup> culture flasks. For single channel recordings, 2,500 - 5,000 cells were seeded on poly-L-lysine-coated glass coverslips and cultured for 24 - 48 hrs at 27 \u00b0C before use.</p>Activity of the Compound 1Compounds of the present disclosure are useful as modulators of ATP binding cassette transporters.
