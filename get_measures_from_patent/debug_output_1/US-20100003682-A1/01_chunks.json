    " coupled with an assay specificity greater than 80%).</p>When a plurality of markers of the invention are used in the compositions, kits, and methods of the invention, the level of expression of each marker in a patient sample can be compared with the normal level of expression of each of the plurality of markers in non-cancerous samples of the same type, either in a single reaction mixture (i.e. using reagents, such as different fluorescent probes, for each marker) or in individual reaction mixtures corresponding to one or more of the markers. In one embodiment, a significantly increased level of expression of more than one of the plurality of markers in the sample, relative to the corresponding normal levels, is an indication that the patient is afflicted with breast or ovarian cancer. When a plurality of markers is used, it is preferred that 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, or 50 or more individual markers be used, wherein fewer markers are preferred.</p>In order to maximize the sensitivity of the compositions, kits, and methods of the invention (i.e. by interference attributable to cells of non-breast or ovarian origin in a patient sample), it is preferable that the marker of the invention used therein be a marker which has a restricted tissue distribution, e.g., normally not expressed in a non-breast or ovarian tissue.</p>Only a small number of markers are known to be associated with breast or ovarian cancers (e.g., for breast: BRCA1 and BRCA2; and, for ovarian: AKT2, Ki-RAS, ERBB2, c-MYC, RB1, and TP53). These markers are not, of course, included among the markers of the invention, although they may be used together with one or more markers of the invention in a panel of markers, for example. It is well known that certain types of genes, such as oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, growth factor-like genes, protease-like genes, and protein kinase-like genes are often involved with development of cancers of various types. Thus, among the markers of the invention, use of those which correspond to proteins which resemble known proteins encoded by known oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, and those which correspond to proteins which resemble growth factors, proteases, and protein kinases are preferred.</p>It is recognized that the compositions, kits, and methods of the invention will be of particular utility to patients having an enhanced risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer and their medical advisors. Patients recognized as having an enhanced risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer include, for example, patients having a familial history of breast or ovarian cancer, patients identified as having a mutant oncogene (i.e. at least one allele), and patients of advancing age (i.e. women older than about 50 or 60 years).</p>The level of expression of a marker in normal (i.e. non-cancerous) human breast or ovarian tissue can be assessed in a variety of ways. In one embodiment, this normal level of expression is assessed by assessing the "
