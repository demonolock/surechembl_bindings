    "tein kinase that has been previously shown to act downstream of ras p21 (Dickson et al., Nature (London), 360:600-603 (1992) and Han et al., Nature (London), 363:133- 140 (1993)). It has been recently demonstrated that Raf interacts with the GTP-bound but not with the GDP-bound form of ras p21, that Raf binds to the effector loop of ras p21 (Van Aelst et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:6213-6217 \n\n(1993); Vojtek et al. , Cell. 74:205-214 (1993); and Warne et al., Nature (London), 364:352-355 (1993)), and that Raf inhibits the GTPase-activating activity of GTPase-activating protein (GAP) , which is known to interact with the effector loop of ras p21 (Warne, supra and Zhang et al., Nature</p>(London), 364:308-313 (1993)). These results have indicated that Raf is an effector protein of ras p21, consistent with previous observations that Raf acts downstream of ras p21 in signaling pathways that mediate both the differentiation and mitogenic responses to receptor tyrosine kinases (Dickson et al. , supra and Han et al., supra) . However, it is possible that ras p21 has effector proteins other than Raf, since ras p21 has multiple functions (Lowy, supra) .</p>The present invention identifies a novel protein that interacts with ras p21 in the yeast two-hybrid system. This protein, termed RGL (ra GDS-like) , is highly homologous with ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulation (ralGDS) , a GDP/GTP exchange protein for ral p24, a member of small G- protein superfamily and a 115-kD protein (Albright et al., EMBO J.. 12:339-347 (1993)). According to the present invention, the ras p21-binding domain of RGL binds to ras p21 through the effector loop of ras p21 and that this domain is highly conserved in ralGDS. Therefore, RGL and ralGDS were examined as to whether they could be effector proteins of ras p21. Since ralGDS has been well characterized, it was tested in this invention. Three characteristics that could be considered to be criteria for identification of an effector protein of ras p21 were tested: (i) the protein must interact with the GTP-bound active form of ras p21 but not with the GDP-bound inactive form, (ii) it must interact with ras p21 through the effector loop of ras p21, and (iii) ideally the protein should inhibit the interaction of ras p21 with other effector proteins such as Raf. By both in vitro and in vivo studies, it was demonstrated that ralGDS fulfills these three characteristics.</p>The yeast two-hybrid system (Chien et al. , PNAS. 88:9578-9582 (1991)) allows detection of proteins capable of interacting with a known protein that results in the immediate \n\navailability of the cloned genes for these interacting proteins. Briefly, the method is as follows. Plasmids are constructed to encode two hybrid proteins which are coexpressed in Saccharo yces cerevisiae. One hybrid consists of the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcriptional activator protein GAL4 fused to the known protein; the other hybrid consists of the GAL4 activat"
