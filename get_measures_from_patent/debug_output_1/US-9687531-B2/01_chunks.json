    "containing 1 mM M6P and 1 mg/ml mannan, and then twice with PBS alone.</p>All cells were lysed in GAA assay buffer and assayed for GAA activity using 4-methylumbelliferyl-\u03b1-D-glucopyranoside as described above.</p>As depicted in FIG. 14A, direct conjugation of bis-M6P-hydrazide to periodate oxidized rhGAA did not affect its specific enzymatic activity. Furthermore, the neo-rhGAA thus generated had increased binding to the CI-MPR column, as depicted in FIG. 14B. In fact, more than 95% of neo-rhGAA now bound to the CI-MPR column compared to only about 30% of the unmodified rhGAA that bound to the column.</p>Consistent with the increased CI-MPR column binding, monosaccharide analysis of the neoGAA confirmed that the modified enzyme contained higher levels of phosphorylated oligornannose residues. The M6P content was increased from average of 0.9 mole M6P1mole of unmodified rhGAA to about 15 mole M6P/mole of neo-rhGAA, which translates to about 7 bis-M6P glycans conjugated onto the neo-rhGAA.</p>Furthermore, consistent with a higher affinity for the CI-MPR, the neo-rhGAA also exhibited an improved uptake by L6 myoblasts. As shown in FIG. 15A, uptake of neo-rhGAA approached saturation at about 25 nM (closed squares) compared to approximately 500 nM for the unmodified rhGAA (closed circles). Uptake was blocked by the addition of excess M6P, confirming that the uptake of the enzyme by the L6 cells was primarily mediated via the CI-MPR. Based on the half maximal value of uptake, the dissociation constant (kd) of neo-rhGAA to CI-MPR was estimated to be around 2.5 nM, a value in agreement with the Kd of the natural bis-M6P oligosaccharides previously reported. (Tong et al., 264 J. BIOL. CHEM. 7962-7969 (1989)). In contrast, the Kd of the unmodified rhGAA to CI-MPR was about 100 nM, also close to the experimentally determined Kd for mono-M6P bearing oligosaccharides previously reported. (Distler t al., 266 J. BIOL. CHEM. 21687-21692 (1991)).</p>Mannose receptors on macrophage cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells are considered to be responsible for the clearance of glycoproteins in vivo by binding to mannose residues. In order to determine whether the addition of bis-M6P glycans on neo-rhGAA affects its uptake by mannose receptors, an in vitro cell uptake assay was performed with macrophages. As depicted in FIG, 15B, uptake of rhGAA was barely detectable after 2 hours even at 25 nM concentration. Furthermore, inclusion of inhibitors for CI-MPR and mannose receptor did not change the GAA activity in these cells. However, uptake of neo-rhGAA was readily detectable and was inhibited by M6P, but not by mannan, indicating that the increase in uptake into macrophages was mediated by M6P.</p>Example 10Modifying rhGAA with Bis-M6P Hydrazide Resulted in a Significant Improvement in Glycogen Clearance in Young Pompe MiceTo determine whether the improved uptake and targeting properties of neo-rhGAA conjugated with synthetic glycan would result in a greater reduction in glycogen storage, young Pompe mice (5 months of age) were treated with either neo rhGAA or unmodified rhGAA. Animal studies were conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No 86-23). Groups of Pompe mice (5-7 animals /group) were injected vi"
