{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\nBased on the half maximal value of uptake, the dissociation constant (kd) of neo-rhGAA to CI-MPR was estimated to be around 2.5 nM, a value in agreement with the Kd of the natural bis-M6P oligosaccharides previously reported.\nIn contrast, the Kd of the unmodified rhGAA to CI-MPR was about 100 nM, also close to the experimentally determined Kd for mono-M6P bearing oligosaccharides previously reported.\nAs shown in FIG. 15A, uptake of neo-rhGAA approached saturation at about 25 nM (closed squares) compared to approximately 500 nM for the unmodified rhGAA (closed circles)."}
