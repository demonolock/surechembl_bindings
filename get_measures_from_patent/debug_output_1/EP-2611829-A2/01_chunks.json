Alternatively, the fragments are at least 15, at least 20, at least 50, at least 75, or at least 100 amino acids in length. </p> The term \"specifically binds\", as used herein in relation to antigen binding, proteins means that the antigen binding protein binds to the HER3 receptor as well as a discrete domain, or discrete amino acid sequence, within a HER3 receptor with no or insignificant binding to other (for example, unrelated) proteins. This term, however, does not exclude the fact that the antigen binding proteins may also be cross-reactive with closely related molecules (for example, the \n\n HER2 receptor). The antigen binding proteins described herein may bind to the HER3 receptor with at least 2, 5, 10, 50, 100, or 1000-fold greater affinity than they bind to closely related molecules, such as the HER2 receptor. </p> Ranges provided herein include all values within a particular range described and values about an endpoint for a particular range. </p> The binding affinity (K<sub>D</sub>) of the antigen binding protein-HER3 interaction may be 1 mM or less, 100 nM or less, 10 nM or less, 2 nM or less or 1 nM or less. Alternatively, the K<sub>D</sub> may be between 5 and 10 nM; or between 1 and 2 nM. The K<sub>D</sub> may be between 1 pM and 500 pM; or between 500 pM and 1 nM. The binding affinity of the antigen binding protein is determined by the association constant (Ka) and the dissociation constant (Kd) (KD = Kd/Ka). The binding affinity may be measured by BIACORE\u2122, for example, by capture of the test antibody onto a protein-A coated sensor surface and flowing HER3 receptor over this surface. Alternatively, the binding affinity can be measured by FORTEBIOTM, for example, with the test antibody receptor captured onto a protein-A coated needle and flowing HER3 receptor over this surface. </p> The K<sub>d</sub> may be lxl 0<sup>\"3</sup> Ms<sup>\"1</sup> or less, lxl 0<sup>\"4</sup> Ms<sup>\"1</sup> or less, or lxl 0<sup>\"5</sup> Ms<sup>\"1</sup> or less.

    "nal or discontinuous epitope may be identical to, similar to, or overlap with the HER3 receptor binding site. The epitope may be accessible when the HER3 receptor is in its mature form and as \n\n part of a dimer with another receptor molecule. The epitope may also be accessible when the HER3 receptor is in its mature form and as part of a tetramer with other HER3 receptor binding molecules as described. The epitope may be distributed across two HER3 receptor polypeptides. This type of discontinuous epitope may comprise sequences from each HER3 receptor molecule. The sequences may, in the context of the dimer' s tertiary and quaternary structure, be near enough to each other to form an epitope and be bound by an antigen binding protein. Conformational and/or discontinuous epitopes may be identified by known methods, for example CLIPS\u2122 (Pepscan Systems). </p> The antigen binding protein may have a half life of at least 6 hours, at least 1 day, at least 2 days, at least 3 days, at least 4 days, at least 5 days, at least 7 days, or at least 9 days in vivo in humans, or in a murine animal model. </p> Mutational changes to the Fc effector portion of the antibody can be used to change the affinity of the interaction between the FcRn and antibody to modulate antibody turnover. The half life of the antibody can be extended in vivo. This would be beneficial to patient populations as maximal dose amounts and maximal dosing frequencies could be achieved as a result of maintaining in vivo IC50 for longer periods of time. </p> The HER3 receptor polypeptide to which the antigen binding protein binds may be a recombinant polypeptide. The HER3 receptor may be in solution, or may be attached to a solid surface. For example, the HER3 receptor may be attached to beads, such as magnetic beads. In addition, the HER3 receptor may be biotinylated. The biotin molecule conjugated to the HER3 receptor may be used to immobilize HER3 on a solid surface by coupling biotinstreptavidin on the solid surface. </p> The antigen binding protein may be derived from rat, mouse, primate (e.g., cynomolgus, Old World monkey or Great Ape), or human. The antigen binding protein may be a humanized or chimeric antibody. </p> The antigen binding protein may comprise a constant region, which may be of any isotype or subclass. The constant region may be of the IgG isotype, for example, IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4 or variants thereof. The antigen binding protein constant region may be IgGl . </p> The antigen binding protein may comprise one or more modifications selected from a mutated constant domain such that the antibody has enhanced effector functions/ ADCC and/or complement activation. Examples of suitable modifications are described in Shields, et ah, J. Biol. Chem.

Several buffer cycles were run prior to analyte protein to ensure cycle consistency and in some experiments a buffer cycle is used a \"double reference[.]\" Analytes used were human full length HER3 extra cellular domain (ECD), separate sub-domains of the extracellular portion of human HER3 (Dl, D2, D3, D4), or combination HER3 domain proteins (Dl-2 and D2-3). All were human HER3 ECD analytes were expressed and prepared using standard techniques. </p> During kinetic experiment cycles a mock coupled surface provides a reference which is subtracted from the specific antibody-analyte RU data in run to eliminate buffer artifacts. Double referencing was performed for some runs by subtracting a buffer only cycle from analyte containing cycle data for each concentration in the set of kinetic curves. Resulting curve data are globally fitted to the 1 : 1 Langmuir model using BIAEVALUATION\u2122 Software (v.3.2). </p>3.2.

DISCUSSION </p> The monoclonal murine 1D9 antibody and murine 15D5 antibody were generated against the human HER3 extracellular domain. The murine 1D9 antibody antibody binds to the full- length, human HER3 ECD and sub-domain 3 of the human HER3 ECD. The murine 15D5 antibody binds to the full-length, human HER3 ECD and sub-domain 2 of the human HER3 ECD. </p> Nanomolar and subnanomolar affinities of all antibodies were determined for interaction with the full-length, human HER3 ECD and select human HER3 ECD sub-domains. Similar overall affinities (KD) are seen for both the murine 1D9 antibody and the murine 15D5 antibodies with the murine 1D9 antibody antibody having a faster on (ka) and off rate (kd). The murine</p>15D5 antibody has been demonstrated to bind to sub-domains 2, 1 -2 and 2-3 of the human HER3 \n\n ECD, but not to sub-domains 1, 3 or 4 by immunoassay and competitive immunocytochemisry. BIACORE\u2122 analysis shows an augmented affinity for these portions of the HER3 ECD (i.e., sub-domains 2, 1-2 and 2-3 of the human HER3 ECD) relative to the full-length, human HER3 ECD (sub-domains 1-4). This effect is seen with all three sub-domain 2 containing human HER3 ECD protein constructs (D2, D 1-2 and D2-3) and, without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed this may be due to a greater accessibility of the epitope within domain 2 in the smaller sub-domain proteins. Furthermore, without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed structural considerations make it likely the murine 15D5 antibody has greater affinity for an open conformation of the HER3 receptor. This open conformation has been shown to be the state when the receptor is engaging heregulin ligand. The chimeric 15D5 antibody and the chimeric 1D9 antibody retain similar affinity to the parent murine 1D9 antibody and murine 15D5 antibodies. </p>Example 2 </p> X-ray crystallographic analysis was coupled with in silico modelling to predict the binding interfaces for the murine 1D9 antibody and its variants. These analyses also provided mechanistic insight into the functional neutralization observed with the murine 1D9 antibody, and facilitated rational antibody maturation.

RESULTS </p> 4.2.1 Inhibition of Heregulin Induced HER3 Receptor Phosphorylation with anti-HER3 </p>Antibodies in Cancer Cells </p> The anti-HER3 1D9 and 15D5 antibodies inhibited heregulin induced HER3 </p>phosphorylation in the BxPC3 (Figure 1), CHL-1 (Figure 2), N87 (Figure 3), SK-BR-3 (Figure 4), BT-474 (Figure 5), and MCF-7 (Figure 6) cancer cells. All 1D9 antibody constructs, including the humanized 1D9 POTELLIGENT\u2122 antibody and the humanized ACCRETAMAB\u2122 antibody, showed potent inhibition with IC50 values ranging from 2.5 to 40.6 ng/ml IC50 values, as shown in Table 12. \n\n Table 12.

The most potent inhibition of AKT phosphorylation was seen in the BxPC3 cells, where the humanized 1D9 ACCRETAMAB\u2122 antibody inhibited heregulin induced phospho-AKT formation with an IC50 value of 2.6 ng/ml (Table 13). </p>Table 13.

HER2 or HER4 with HER3 BACMAM\u2122 Transduced CHO Cells </p> The anti-HER3 1D9 antibodies and 15D5 antibodies inhibited heregulin induced HER3 phosphorylation in CHO cells co-transduced with the human HER3 receptor and the EGFR, HER2, or HER4 receptor as indicated. These antibodies were capable of inhibiting heregulin induced formation of EGFR-HER3, HER2-HER3, or HER4-HER3 heterodimers. IC50 values are listed in Table 15. </p>Table 15. Inhibition of heregulin induced human HER3 receptor phosphorylation with anti-HER3 antibodies. </p></p>5. DISCUSSION </p> The HER3 receptor tyrosine kinase belongs to the human epidermal growth factor receptor family that also includes EGFR (HER1), HER2, and HER4. HER3 binds heregulin ligand, but is intrinsically kinase dead. It must dimerize with other family members to allow transphosphorylation of tyrosine residues in its intracellular C-terminal domain. Subsequent downstream signalling resulting from activated, phosporylated HER3 receptor includes the PI3K/AKT survival pathway. </p> The data in this example demonstrates the anti-HER3 1D9 antibodies and 15D5 antibodies can inhibit heregulin induced HER3 receptor phosphorylation. Treatment of cancer cell lines with the 1D9 antibodies prior to heregulin stimulation resulted in complete inhibition of \n\n heregulin- induced HER3 phosphorylation. Figure 16 shows the IC50 values of the different 1D9 antibodies for inhibiting HER3 phosphorylation across different cancer cell lines. Downstream AKT phosphorylation was also decreased with 1D9 antibody and 15D5 antibody treatments. Thus, the 1D9 antibodies and 15D5 antibodies inhibit heregulin- induced HER3 phosphorylation and decrease downstream AKT signalling. </p> Epidermal growth factor and betacellulin are ligands for EGFR, and can induce EGFR- HER3 heterodimer formation. SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells showed an induction of HER3 phosphorylation when treated with either of these EGFR ligands. Treatment of SK-BR-3 cells with 1D9 antibodies or 15D5 antbodies inhibited epidermal growth factor or betacellulin induced HER3 phosphorylation (Figure 1 1 and Figure 12). This indicates these antibodies act as heterodimerization inhibitors and can prevent activated EGFR from dimerizing with HER3. </p> The 1D9 antibodies and 15D5 antibodies specifically inhibited EGFR-HER3, or HER2- HER3, or HER4-HER3 heregulin-induced heterodimer formation. CHO cells were transduced with HER3 plus only one other family member capable of transphosphorylating HER3 upon heterodimer formation. Regardless of whether EGFR, or HER2, or HER4 was used as the dimerizing partner, the 1D9 antibodies and 15D5 antibodies inhibited heregulin induced HER3 phosphorylation (Figure 13, Figure 14 and Figure 15). This indicates the 1D9 antibodies and 15D5 antibodies prevent heregulin induced heterodimer formation with these other family me"
