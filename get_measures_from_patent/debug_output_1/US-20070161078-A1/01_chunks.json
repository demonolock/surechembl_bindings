    "ologous and homologous, i.e., related, sequences. Fusion proteins also consist of amino acid sequences with or without N-terminal methionine residues, those tagged for identification with antigenic epitopes, as well as, those having a signal generating compound as a fusion partner, e.g., fusion proteins with a fluorescent partner; an enzyme partner such as \u03b2-galactosidase; a chemilluminescent partner such as luciferase; and the like. </p> \u201cCapture agent\u201d, when used in the context of a diagnostic assay reagent or method, refers to an agent that is capable of binding to an influenza viral analyte in a binding interaction that is of sufficient strength, e.g. measured as a binding affinity, and specificity that it enables concentration of the viral analyte from within a mixture of different viral analytes; and, in a time period suitable for use in an a diagnostic assay format, i.e., typically about 5 minutes to about 90 minutes; preferably about 5 minutes to about 60 minutes; and, most preferably about 5 minutes to about 30 minutes. According to alternative embodiments of the invention, the instant capture agents are contain either a PDZ domain or a PL. Representative capture agents are illustrated in the Examples section below. Capture agents usually \u201cspecifically bind\u201d one or more viral analytes, e.g., PL containing proteins, to the exclusion of other analytes, e.g., proteins that do not contain a PL. Preferably, the instant capture agents bind the subject viral analyte with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) that is less than about 10<sup>\u22126 </sup>M; preferably, less than about 10<sup>\u22127</sup>M; and, most preferably, less than about 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M. </p> \u201cSpecific binding\u201d, when used in regard to the binding interaction between the instant natural and non-natural PDZ domain and PL reagents, is used to refer to the ability of a capture- or detect-agent to preferentially bind to a particular viral analyte that is present in a mixture of different viral analytes. In certain embodiments, the subject specific binding interaction is capable of discriminating between proteins having or lacking a PL, i.e., in some embodiments the discriminatory capacity is greater than about 10- to about 100-fold; and, preferably greater than about 1000- to about 10,000-fold. </p> The term \u201csubstantial identity\u201d means that two peptide sequences, when optimally aligned, such as by the programs GAP or BESTFIT using default gap weights, share at least 65 percent sequence identity, preferably at least 80 or 90 percent sequence identity, more preferably at least 95 percent sequence identity or more (e.g., 99 percent sequence identity or higher). Preferably, residue positions which are not identical differ by conservative amino acid substitutions. </p> \u201cBinding interference\u201d, is used in regard to the first binding interaction of a PDZ domain with a PL to form a complex in a diagnostic assay format; wherein, the subject complex is subsequently detected in a requisite seco",
    " instead of 20 uM. This results in slightly lower sensitivity for detection of interactions with low affinity and/or rapid dissociation rate. Correspondingly, it slightly increases the certainty that detected interactions are of sufficient affinity and half-life to be of biological importance and useful therapeutic targets. </p> The \u201cG\u201d assay\u201d is identical to the \u201cG<sup>0 </sup>assay\u201d except that at step (2) the peptide concentration is 1 \u03bcM instead of 20 \u03bcM and the incubation is performed for 60 minutes at 25\u00b0 C. (rather than, e.g., 10 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. followed by 20 minutes at 25\u00b0 C.). This results in lower sensitivity for interactions of low affinity, rapid dissociation rate, and/or affinity that is less at 25\u00b0 C. than at 4\u00b0 C. Interactions will have lower affinity at 25\u00b0 C. than at 4\u00b0 C. if (as we have found to be generally true for PDZ-ligand binding) the reaction entropy is negative (i.e. the entropy of the products is less than the entropy of the reactants). In contrast, the PDZ-PL binding signal may be similar in the \u201cG\u201d assay\u201d and the \u201cG<sup>0 </sup>assay\u201d for interactions of slow association and dissociation rate, as the PDZ-PL complex will accumulate during the longer incubation of the \u201cG\u201d assay.\u201d Thus comparison of results of the \u201cG\u201d assay\u201d and the \u201cG<sup>0 </sup>assay\u201d can be used to estimate the relative entropies, enthalpies, and kinetics of different PDZ-PL interactions. (Entropies and enthalpies are related to binding affinity by the equations delta G=RT In (Kd)=delta H\u2212T delta S where delta G, H, and S are the reaction free energy, enthalpy, and entropy respectively, T is the temperature in degrees Kelvin, R is the gas constant, and Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant). In particular, interactions that are detected only or much more strongly in the \u201cG<sup>0 </sup>assay\u201d generally have a rapid dissociation rate at 25\u00b0 C. (t1/2&lt;10 minutes) and a negative reaction entropy, while interactions that are detected similarly strongly in the \u201cG\u201d assay\u201d generally have a slower dissociation rate at 25\u00b0 C. (t1/2&gt;10 minutes). Rough estimation of the thermodynamics and kinetics of PDZ-PL interactions (as can be achieved via comparison of results of the \u201cG<sup>0 </sup>assay\u201d versus the \u201cG\u201d assay\u201d as outlined supra) can be used in the design of efficient inhibitors of the interactions. For example, a small molecule inhibitor based on the chemical structure of a PL that dissociates slowly from a given PDZ domain (as evidenced by similar binding in the \u201cG\u201d assay\u201d as in the \u201cG<sup>0 </sup>assay\u201d) may itself dissociate slowly and thus be of high affinity. </p> In this manner, variation of the temperature and duration of step (2) of the \u201cG assay\u201d can be used to provide insight into the kinetics and thermodynamics of the PDZ-ligand binding reaction and into design of inhibitors of the reaction. </p> The detectable labels of the invention can be any detectable compound or composition which is conjugated directly or indirectly with a molecule (such as described above). The label can be detectable by itself (e.g., radioisotope labels or fluorescent labels) or, in the case of an enzymatic label, can catalyze a chemical alteration of a sub",
    "of the invention include the peptides themselves, truncations thereof including at least 5, 10, 15 or 20 contiguous residues starting at the C-terminus, and conservatively substituted variants and mimetics of all of these peptides, optionally incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions. Conservative substitutions, if any, preferably occur outside the C-terminal 3-4 amino acids of the peptides. Peptides that block binding of a pathogenic influenza PL to the PDZ are useful for treating pathogenic influenza. Preferably, the peptides shown in Table 11, truncations, conservatively substituted variants or mimetics thereof are linked to a transporter peptide (protein transduction domain) at the N-terminus of the peptide sequence. Several transporter peptide sequences can be used, including Tat and antennapedia (see also Example 7). Anti-viral therapeutics also include small molecules that inhibit the interaction between a viral PL and a PDZ, as well as Cox2 inhibitors (as identified in Table 8 herein). Some small molecule inhibitors have been identified in Tables 9 and 10 herein. </p> B. Methods of Screening for Anti-Viral Agents </p> Methods of screening for agents that bind to NS1 PL proteins and/or PDZ proteins are disclosed herein. The agents are initially screened for binding to the NS1 PL or the PDZ domain of the PDZ protein. Then they are tested for the ability to inhibit the PDZ/PL interaction. These methods are also provided below in \u201cB. assay for anti-viral agents.\u201d The binding assay can be performed in vitro using natural or synthetic PL proteins. Alternatively, natural or synthetic PDZ domain containing proteins can be used to identify agents capable of binding to a particular PDZ protein. </p> Methods of screening for anti-viral agents disclosed herein identify agents that block or inhibit the interaction between the viral PL and any PDZ protein that it interacts with. Inhibitors and DNA encoding them are screened for capacity to inhibit expression of NS1 and/or PDZ. An initial screen can be performed to select a subset of agents capable of inhibiting or stopping the PDZ/PL interaction. Such an assay can be performed in vitro using an isolated PDZ protein and PL protein or fragments thereof capable of binding to each other. Agents identified by such a screen can then be assayed functionally. Agents can also be screened in cells expressing PL proteins and either expressing the PDZ protein naturally or transformed to express the PDZ protein. </p> In addition to the diagnostic assays disclosed and illustrated above, embodiments provide assays for identifying candidate anti-viral agents capable of modulating one or more binding interactions occurring between an influenza viral PL and a host cell PDZ polypeptide in an influenza A infected cell. The instant methods involve testing the binding of a control PL, e.g., a synthetic PL peptide, to a PDZ domain polypeptide, e.g., a recombinant PDZ fusion protein, in the presence of an anti-viral test ",
    "nstituting a near complete set (255) of all the different PDZ domains in the human genome. Each PDZ domain polypeptide was expressed as a recombinant GST-PDZ polypeptide in a commercial glutathione S-transferase tagged expression system. Specific binding of biotinylated-PL peptides to PDZ domain polypeptides was detected using streptavidin-HRP and TMB substrate. Similarly, specific binding of NS1-MBP fusion proteins to PDZ domain polypeptides was visualized using biotinylated anti-MBP, streptavidin-HRP and TMB substrate. The relative strength of binding was analyzed and the strong and weak binders are shown for each PL. A PDZ protein that binds more strongly is preferable when used for capturing or identifying PL proteins. However for tests that use differential binding of the PDZ protein to various PL proteins, weak binding PDZ proteins may still be useful.

These molecules can be used to block PDZ/PL interactions of therapeutic value, including Influenza A NS1/PDZ interactions. </p> C. Peptide therapeutic inhibitors were identified and tested (see Table 11). Each influenza A NS1 protein type containing a PL (H5N1, H3N2 and H1N1) has the potential to interact with several PDZs. Each of these PDZ's may in itself be a potential therapeutic target against the relevant Influenza A strain, and as such, blocking the PDZ with a peptide may have therapeutic utility. In order to identify potential therapeutic peptides, an AVC proprietary database was searched for PDZ ligands of each of the PDZ's. The AVC database contained PL/PDZ interactions that were identified as such based on a proprietary ELISA based assay (G assay) previously described. The criterion used to identify promising PL's was based on the following three criteria: 1) OD(450 nm)&gt;=0.5, 2) Relative standard deviation of measurements&lt;0.25, 3) Peptide concentration=&lt;20 micromolar. </p> Based on a database of PDZ/PL binding interactions, structure and binding data, C-terminal sequences were identified as most likely to bind to the PSD95 d2 structure (SEQ ID NO:1, for example) based on PSD95 d2 structure and binding data. Thus, preferred peptide therapeutic inhibitors for the Avian FluA (H5N1) are based on peptid"
