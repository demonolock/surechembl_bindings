{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\nTCRs of the present description preferably bind to an HAVCR1-001 peptide-HLA molecule complex with a binding affinity (KD) of about 100 \u03bcM or less, about 50 \u03bcM or less, about 25 \u03bcM or less, or about 10 \u03bcM or less.\nMore preferred are high affinity TCRs having binding affinities of about 1 \u03bcM or less, about 100 nM or less, about 50 nM or less, about 25 nM or less.\nNon-limiting examples of preferred binding affinity ranges for TCRs of the present invention include about 1 nM to about 10 nM; about 10 nM to about 20 nM; about 20 nM to about 30 nM; about 30 nM to about 40 nM; about 40 nM to about 50 nM; about 50 nM to about 60 nM; about 60 nM to about 70 nM; about 70 nM to about 80 nM; about 80 nM to about 90 nM; and about 90 nM to about 100 nM.\nAs used herein in connect with TCRs of the present description, \u201cspecific binding\u201d and grammatical variants thereof are used to mean a TCR having a binding affinity (KD) for an HAVCR1-001 peptide-HLA molecule complex of 100 \u03bcM or less.\nAffinity-enhancement of tumor-specific TCRs, and its exploitation, relies on the existence of a window for optimal TCR affinities. The existence of such a window is based on observations that TCRs specific for HLA-A2-restricted pathogens have KD values that are generally about 10-fold lower when compared to TCRs specific for HLA-A2-restricted tumor-associated self-antigens."}
