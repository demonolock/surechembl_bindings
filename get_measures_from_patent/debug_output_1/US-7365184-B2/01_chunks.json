    "ts is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio ED<sub>50</sub>/LD<sub>50</sub>. Compositions that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred.</p>The data obtained from animal studies can be used in formulating a range of doses for use in humans. The therapeutically effective doses of in humans lay preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED<sub>50 </sub>with little or no toxicity. The dosage can vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. Ideally, a single dose of each drug should be used daily.</p>Compounds. According to the present invention, the furanone compounds, or compounds that inhibit LuxS or PA expression or activity, will be administered to a subject in a range from about 0.5-100 mg/kg/day, preferably, from about 5.0-75.0 mg/kg/day, and more preferably, from about 10-50 mg/kg/day. For example, for administration for evaluation in a mouse model, about 50-100 \u03bcg/ml, up to about 200 \u03bcg/mouse, may be administered.</p>Antibodies and antisense molecules. In the embodiment of the invention where antibodies are administered (which specifically bind to e.g., LuxS or PA), typical doses are in the range from about 1-500 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, depending on the binding properties of the antibody. For antisense molecules, administration is contemplated in a range from about 5-250 mg/kg/day, preferably from about 10-100 mg/kg/day, and more preferably from about 20-50 mg/kd/day.</p>Vaccines. The dosage of the vaccine (number of bacteria, number of administrations) will depend on route of administration and will vary according to the species to be protected. The LuxS mutant strain should be able to persist in the host for extended periods of time, usually weeks, to enhance the effectiveness of the immunizing effect by continuous stimulation of the host immune system until the host immune system has cleared all the organisms. In view of the fact that the non-virulence does not depend on any host cellular function, the strain is expected to be non-virulent even in immunodeficient hosts.</p>In one embodiment of the present invention where mutated B. anthracis cells are administered to a subject to treat or prevent B. anthracis, infection following exposure, the amount will be determined based e.g., on the in vitro colony forming units (CFU) of the bacterial strain infecting, or at risk of infecting, and the route of infection of the host. Alternatively, the LD<sub>50 </sub>can be used. Published LD<sub>50 </sub>for anthrax by the parenteral route range from less than 10 spores for a guinea pig through 3\u00d710<sup>3 </sup>for the rhesus monkey, 10<sup>6 </sup>for the rat, 10<sup>9 </sup>for the pig and 5\u00d710<sup>10 </sup>for the dog (Watson and Keir, 1994). Minimum infectious dose (MID) estimates are only rarely available, but an aerosol MID for sheep of 35,000 spores has been recorded (Fildes, 1943).</p>In one embodiment, the B. anthracis vaccine of "
