    "/sup>M or less, and more preferably 5.0\u00d710<sup>\u22129 </sup>M or less.</p>The term \u201cdoes not substantially bind\u201d to a protein or cells, as used herein, means does not bind or does not bind with a high affinity to the protein or cells, i.e. binds to the protein or cells with a K<sub>D </sub>of 1.0\u00d710<sup>\u22126 </sup>M or more, more preferably 1.0\u00d710<sup>\u22125 </sup>M or more, more preferably 1.0\u00d710<sup>\u22124 </sup>M or more, more preferably 1.0\u00d710<sup>\u22123 </sup>M or more, even more preferably 1.0\u00d710<sup>\u22122 </sup>M or more.</p>The term \u201chigh affinity\u201d for an IgG antibody refers to an antibody having a K<sub>D </sub>of 1.0\u00d710<sup>\u22127 </sup>M or less, more preferably 1.0\u00d710<sup>\u221210 </sup>M or less, even more preferably 1.0\u00d710<sup>\u22129 </sup>M or less, and even more preferably 1.0\u00d710<sup>\u221210 </sup>M or less for a target antigen. However, \u201chigh affinity\u201d binding can vary for other antibody isotypes. For example, \u201chigh affinity\u201d binding for an isotype refers to an antibody having a K<sub>D </sub>of 10<sup>\u22126 </sup>M or less, inure preferably 10<sup>\u22127</sup>M or less, even more preferably 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M or less.</p>The term \u201cK<sub>assoc</sub>\u201d or \u201cK<sub>a</sub>\u201d, as used herein, is intended to refer to the association rate of a particular antibody-antigen interaction, whereas the term \u201cK<sub>dis</sub>\u201d or \u201cK<sub>d</sub>\u201d, as used herein, is intended to refer to the dissociation rate of a particular antibody-antigen interaction. The term \u201cK<sub>D</sub>\u201d, as used herein, is intended to refer to the dissociation constant, which is obtained from the ratio of K<sub>d </sub>to K<sub>a </sub>(i.e., K<sub>d</sub>/K<sub>a</sub>) and is expressed as a molar concentration (M). K<sub>D </sub>values for antibodies can be determined using methods well established in the art. A preferred method for determining the K<sub>D </sub>of an antibody is by using surface plasmon resonance, preferably using a biosensor system such as a Biacore\u2122 system.</p>The term \u201cEC<sub>50</sub>\u201d, also known as half maximal effective concentration, refers to the concentration of an antibody which induces a response halfway between the baseline and maximum after a specified exposure time.</p>The term \u201cIC<sub>50</sub>\u201d, also known as half maximal inhibitory concentration, refers to the concentration of an antibody which inhibits a specific biological or biochemical function by 50% relative to the absence of the antibody.</p>The term \u201csubject\u201d includes any human or nonhuman animal. The term \u201cnonhuman animal\u201d includes all vertebrates, e.g., mammals and non-mammals, such as non-human primates, sheep, dogs, cats, cows, horses, chickens, amphibians, and reptiles, although mammals are preferred, such as non-human primates, sheep, dogs, cats, cows and horses.</p>The term \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d means an amount of the antibody or the antigen binding portion of the present disclosure sufficient to prevent or ameliorate the symptoms associated with a disease or condition (such as a chronic inflammation) and/or lessen the severity of the disease or condition. A therapeutically effective amount is understood to be in context to the condition being treated, where the actual effective amount is readily discerned by those of skill in the art.</p>Various aspects of the disclosure are described below in further detail.</p>The antibody, or the antigen-binding portion thereof, of the disclosure specifically binds to human, monkey and/or mouse PD-1 and has i) comparable, if not higher, binding affinity/capacity- to human, monkey and mouse PD-1, ii) comparable, if not higher, blocking activity on PD-1-PD-L1 interaction, and/or iii) comparable, if not better, in vivo anti-tumor activity, as compared to prior art ant"
