    "ulture of LE 392. After five hours, the plates were overlaid with 0.5\u00d7BBL DNase test agar plus 0.01% toluidine blue plus 10 mM MgCl2. A total of 10 plates was screened. Forty-four pink plaques (potentially nuclease positive) were rescreened. Nine of the 44 pink plaques consistently rescreened as positive for nuclease activity.</p>Because the production of S. pyogenes DNase is deleterious to the host E. coli bacteria, the plaque size of these nuclease positive clones was much smaller than for nuclease negative clones. Accordingly, there was selection pressure for accumulating mutations that would lower the nuclease activity, which complicates the task of isolating a stable nuclease positive clone.</p>One of the advances of the selection and screening procedure of the present invention is to lower the selection pressure allowing stable nuclease positive clones. To do this, E. coli strain Y1090 without the plasmid pMC9 was used as the host for nuclease carrying phage. Plate lysates were used to generate stocks to plaque purify the clones. For this procedure, the host and phage were plated directly on 0.5\u00d7BBL DNase test agar plus 0.01% toluidine blue plus 10 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>directly instead of overlaying after five hours of incubation.</p>Lysates of the nine recombinant clones were analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing DNA. The nuclease in all nine clones retained their activity after SDS denaturation and all have the same apparent molecular weight, approximately 25 kd.</p>These nine lysates were analyzed on the PhastGel system with IEF 3-9 gels for electrofocusing. After electrophoresis, the gels were overlaid with 3.5 ml DNase substrate (Streptonase B kit) (Difco, Detroit, Mich.) in 1% agarose in TAE (40 mM Tris, 5 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8). The activity bands for all 9 lysates at the edge of the basic end of the gel, suggesting a very high pI for the cloned nuclease. This also suggested that all nine clones contained the same gene.</p>In particular, one phage showing DNase activity, designated as 2-6 was analyzed further. The \u03bb DNase 2-6 clone was analyzed with restriction endonuclease analysis to characterize the DNA fragment. The S. pyogenes genomic insert in the \u03bb vector in the 2-6 clone was approximately 5.2 kb. The location of the nuclease gene was determined by subcloning smaller regions of the DNase 2-6 clone back into \u03bb gt 11 and testing the subclones for nuclease activity. FIG. 2 shows the location of the various subclones and their nuclease activity. Subclones 1 and 4 produced nuclease activity but were very unstable. Subclones 2 and 3 lacked nuclease activity but were stable. The results of this subcloning indicated that at least part of the DNase B gene resides in the internal Sac I/Eco RI fragment. The amino-terminal sequence from the DNase B protein was used in conjunction with the genetic code to generate a set of degenerate oligonucleotides that was used to hybridize to the DNase 2-6 insert and some of the su",
    ", and a pressure of 20 lbs per square inch (1.4 Kg/cm<sup>2)</sup>. The initial volume of 105 liters of media was eventually concentrated to 4 liters with a protein concentration of 2.3 mg/ml.</p>Diethylaminoethyl cellulose (DEAE-cellulose) (DE23, Whatman, England) was regenerated by washing with 15 volumes of 0.5 M HCl followed by a second wash with 15 volumes of 0.5 M NaOH. After a repetition of the washing with sodium hydroxide, the DEAE-cellulose was washed with water until neutral. Finally, the cellulose was equilibrated overnight in TMC buffer (1 mM Tris, 1 mM MgCl, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.5).</p>The equilibrated wet cellulose (100 g) was added to 500 ml of concentrated S. pyogenes media supernatant. The mixture was shaken at 300 rpm for 20 minutes at 40\u00b0 C. prior to centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 45 minutes. The cellulose was washed with 450 ml of TMC buffer and the two supernatants were combined.</p>Chromatography on Phenyl Sepharose</p>The supernatants from diethylaminoethyl cellulose batch absorption were clarified by filtration through a 0.45 \u03bcm membrane. Ammonium sulfate was added to 0.8 M prior to passage through phenyl Sepharose CL 45 (Pharmacia, Uppsal\u00e1, Sweden) equilibrated with 0.8 M ammonium sulfate, 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.0).</p>The 80-ml phenyl sepharose column was loaded at 1.85 ml/min with 1100 ml of sample at a concentration of 258 \u03bcg/ml. The DNase activity was collected in the flow-through prior to concentration by ultrafiltration using a 10-kd membrane (Diaflo YM10, Amicon Division, W. R. Grace &amp; Co.) The final protein concentration was 0.245 mg/ml, in 55 ml.</p>Chromatography on Heparin Sepharose</p>The concentrated effluent from the phenyl-sepharose column was dialyzed against Heparin Buffer A (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.1 NaCl, 10% glycerol). A heparin Sepharose CL-6B (Pharmacia) column (80 ml) was equilibrated with the Heparin Buffer A prior to loading at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. After washing the column with three volumes of heparin buffer A, a gradient between 0% and 100% buffer B was run at a flow rate of 2.2 ml/min. Buffer B was the same as buffer A except that the concentration of sodium chloride was 1.0 mole/l. The DNase activity eluted at 350 mM NaCl in volume of approximately 250 ml. The DNase activity was concentrated by ultrafiltration.</p>Mono-P Chromatofocusing</p>The concentrated DNase fraction was dialyzed against 25 mM diethanolamine, pH 9.5 prior to chromatofocusing. The mono P 5/20 column (Pharmacia, Piscataway N.J.) equilibrated in the loading buffer (25 nM ethanolamine, pH 9.5), was injected with 500 \u03bcl of sample and washed with 9 ml of loading buffer. The column was eluted with 100% buffer B (10% polybuffer 96 (Pharmacia), pH 6.0). The total volume eluted was 34 ml; fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. Two peaks of activity were collected at pH 8.55-8.4 (fractions 25-29), designated herein as Fraction I, and 8.22-8.13 (fractions 3"
