The term \u201cfusing\u201d refers to the act of creating a fused molecule as described above, such as, e.g., a fusion protein generated from the recombinant fusion of genetic regions which when translated produces a single proteinaceous molecule.</p>The symbol \u201c::\u201d means the polypeptide regions before and after it are physically linked together to form a continuous polypeptide.</p>As used herein, the terms \u201cexpressed,\u201d \u201cexpressing,\u201d or \u201cexpresses,\u201d and grammatical variants thereof, refer to translation of a polynucleotide or nucleic acid into a protein. The expressed protein may remain intracellular, become a component of the cell surface membrane or be secreted into an extracellular space.</p>As used herein, cells which express a significant amount of an extracellular target biomolecule at least one cellular surface are \u201ctarget positive cells\u201d, \u201ctarget+ cells\u201d, or \u201c+ve cells\u201d and are cells physically coupled to the specified, extracellular target biomolecule.</p>As used herein, the symbol \u201ca\u201d is shorthand for an immunoglobulin-type binding region capable of binding to the biomolecule following the symbol. The symbol \u201c\u03b1\u201d is used to refer to the functional characteristic of an immunoglobulin-type binding region based on its ability to bind to the biomolecule following the symbol with a binding affinity described by a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>5 </sup>or less.</p>As used herein, the term \u201cheavy chain variable (V<sub>H</sub>) domain\u201d or \u201clight chain variable (V<sub>L</sub>) domain\u201d respectively refer to any antibody V<sub>H </sub>or V<sub>L </sub>domain (e.g. a human V<sub>H </sub>or V<sub>L </sub>domain) as well as any derivative thereof retaining at least qualitative antigen binding ability of the corresponding native antibody (e.g. a humanized V<sub>H </sub>or V<sub>L </sub>domain derived from a native murine V<sub>H </sub>or V<sub>L </sub>domain). A V<sub>H </sub>or V<sub>L </sub>domain consists of a \u201cframework\u201d region interrupted by the three CDRs or ABRs. As used herein, the term \u201cframework\u201d or \u201cFR\u201d refers to variable domain residues other than hypervariable region (HVR) residues. The FR of a variable domain generally consists of four FR domains: FR1, FR2, FR3, and FR4. Accordingly, the HVR and FR sequences generally appear in the following sequence in a VH (or VL): FR1-H1(L1)-FR2-H2(L2)-FR3-H3(L3)-FR4. The framework regions serve to align the CDRs or ABRs for specific binding to an epitope of an antigen. From amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus, both V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>domains comprise the following framework (FR) and CDR regions or ABR regions: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, and FR4; or, similarly, FR1, ABR1, FR2, ABR2, FR3, ABR3, and FR4. As used herein, the terms \u201cHCDR1,\u201d \u201cHCDR2,\u201d or \u201cHCDR3\u201d are used to refer to CDRs 1, 2, or 3, respectively, in",

In these fusion embodiments, the amino acid sequence following the disrupted furin-cleavage motif should not create a de novo, furin-cleavage site at the fusion junction.</p>Any of the above protease-cleavage resistant, Shiga toxin effector polypeptide sub-regions and/or disrupted furin-cleavage motifs may be used alone or in combination with each individual embodiment as described herein, including methods described herein.</p>3. T-Cell Hyper-Immunized, Shiga Toxin a Subunit Effector PolypeptidesIn some embodiments, the Shiga toxin effector polypeptide of the binding molecule comprises an embedded or inserted epitope-peptide. In some embodiments, the epitope-peptide is a heterologous, T-cell epitope-peptide, such as, e.g., an epitope considered heterologous to Shiga toxin A Subunits. In some embodiments, the epitope-peptide is a CD8+ T-cell epitope. In some embodiments, the CD8+ T-cell epitope-peptide has a binding affinity to a MHC class I molecule characterized by a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>\u22124 </sup>molar or less and/or the resulting MHC class I-epitope-peptide complex has a binding affinity to a T-cell receptor (TCR) characterized by a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>\u22124 </sup>molar or less.</p>In some embodiments, the Shiga toxin effector polypeptide comprises an embedded or inserted, heterologous, T-cell epitope, such as, e.g., a human CD8+ T-cell epitope. In some embodiments, the heterologous, T-cell epitope is embedded or inserted so as to disrupt an endogenous epitope or epitope region (e.g. a B-cell epitope and/or CD4+ T-cell epitope) identifiable in a naturally occurring Shiga toxin polypeptide or parental Shiga toxin effector polypeptide from which the Shiga toxin effector polypeptide is derived.</p>In some embodiments, the Shiga toxin effector polypeptide (and any binding molecule comprising it) is CD8+ T-cell hyper-immunized, such as, e.g., as compared to a wild-type Shiga toxin polypeptide. Each CD8+ T-cell hyper-immunized, Shiga toxin effector polypeptide comprises an embedded or inserted T-cell epitope-peptide. Hyper-immunized, Shiga toxin effector polypeptides can be created from Shiga toxin effector polypeptides and/or Shiga toxin A Subunit polypeptides, whether naturally occurring or not, using a method described herein, described in WO 2015/113005, and/or known to the skilled worker, wherein the resulting molecule still retains one or more Shiga toxin A Subunit functions.</p>A T-cell epitope is a molecular structure which is comprised by an antigenic peptide and can be represented by a linear, amino acid sequence. Commonly, T-cell epitopes are peptides of sizes of eight to el",
    "bout 15 minutes, about 20 minutes, about 25 minutes, about 30 minutes, about 35 minutes, about 40 minutes, about 45 minutes, about 50 minutes, about 55 minutes, or about 60 minutes. In some embodiments, the half-life of a PD-L1 binding molecule is about 1 hour, about 1.5 hours, about 2 hours, about 2.5 hours, about 3 hours, about 3.5 hours, about 4 hours, about 4.5 hours, about 5 hours, about 5.5 hours, about 6 hours, about 6.5 hours, about 7 hours, about 7.5 hours, about 8 hours, about 8.5 hours, about 9 hours, about 9.6 hours, or about 10 hours. In some embodiments, the half-life of a PD-L1 binding molecule is about 2.8 hours, about 3.7 hours, or about 5.6 hours.</p>In some embodiments of the PD-L1 binding molecule, upon administration of the PD-L1 binding molecule to a PD-L1-expressing cell results in (i) the internalization of the PD-L1 binding molecule by the cell and (ii) the cell presenting on a cellular surface a heterologous, CD8+ T-cell epitope-peptide cargo delivered by the PD-L1 binding molecule complexed with a MHC class I molecule.</p>Other Structural VariationsIn some embodiments, fragments, variants, and/or derivatives of the binding molecules are used, which contain a functional binding site to any extracellular part of a PD-L1 target biomolecule, and even more preferably capable of binding a target biomolecule with high affinity (e.g. as shown by K<sub>D</sub>). For example, any binding region which binds an extracellular part of a target biomolecule with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>\u22125 </sup>to 10<sup>\u221212 </sup>moles/liter, preferably less than 200 nM, may be substituted for use in making binding molecules and methods as described herein.</p>The skilled worker will recognize that variations may be made to the Shiga toxin effector polypeptides, antibodies, and binding molecules, and polynucleotides encoding any of the former, without diminishing their biological activities, e.g., by maintaining the overall structure and function of the Shiga toxin effector polypeptide, such as in conjunction with one or more 1) endogenous epitope disruptions which reduce antigenic and/or immunogenic potential, 2) furin-cleavage motif disruptions which reduce proteolytic cleavage, and/or 3) embedded or inserted epitopes which reduce antigenic and/or immunogenic potential or are capable of being delivered to a MHC I molecule for presentation on a cell surface. For example, some modifications may facilitate expression, facilitate purification, improve pharmacokinetic properties, and/or improve immunogenicity. Such modifications are well known to the skilled worker and include, for example, a methionine added at the amino-terminus to provide an initiation site, additional amino acids placed on either terminus to create conveniently located restriction sites or termination codons, and biochemical affinity tags fused to either terminus to provide for convenient detection and/or purification.

Briefly, NUNC MAXISORP\u00ae plates were coated with recombinant human or cynomolgus macaque PD-L1 extracellular domain (ECD) protein, washed with PBS, and blocked to reduce nonspecific background noise. DI-SLT-A1 fusion proteins were incubated with PD-L1 ECD protein, the samples washed, and then DI-SLT-A1 fusion protein levels were detected using an anti DI-SLT-A1 mAb conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The ELISA signal was detected after incubation with TMB-Ultra (3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine) and subsequent neutralization with hydrochloric acid. The absorbance values (Abs) at 450 nanometer (nm) were read using a plate reader, and the background ELISA signal from a buffer only control was subtracted. The mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) values were plotted as a function of the log transformed DI-SLT-A1 fusion protein concentration to determine the Bmax and K<sub>D </sub>using a non-linear curve regression analysis (Prism (GraphPad Prism, San Diego, CA, U.S.A., Prism software function sigmoidal 4PL). Some results from these binding experiments are shown Table 7 and FIGS. 2, 3, 15, and 34. Table 7 shows the dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) as measured in nanogram per milliliter (ng/mL) and Bmax as measured in MFI.</p>The DI-SLT-A1 fusion proteins 115749 (SEQ ID NO:113) and 115750 (SEQ ID NO:114) were tested for binding to PD-L1 from different species and were determined to bind to human and cynomolgus macaque PD-L1, but not mouse PD-L1 as shown in FIG. 2. A control DI-SLT-A1 fusion protein (114964) targeting PD-L1, comprising immunoglobulin binding domains present in atezolizumab known to bind to PD-L1 from human, macaque, and mouse, was used as a positive control.</p>Both PD-L1 binding molecules 115749 (SEQ ID NO:113) and 115750 (SEQ ID NO:114) bound to human PD-L1 and cynomolgus macaque PD-L1 but did not bind to murine PD-L1 in this assay (FIG. 2; Table 7).</p>Closely related DI-SLT-A1 fusion proteins, differing only in the scFv interdomain linker between the light chain domain and the heavy chain domain, were tested in a similar assay to characterize their binding affinities to PD-L1. In this experiment, a dilution series of the DI-SLT-A1 fusion proteins were tested for binding to human or cynomolgus macaque PD-L1 recombinant proteins. Some results from these binding experiments are shown Table 7 and FIGS. 3, 15, and 34.</p>Both PD-L1 binding molecules 115749 (SEQ ID NO:113) and 116297 (SEQ ID NO:128) bound to recombinant human PD-L1 and cynomolgus macaque PD-L1 (Table 7; FIGS. 3, 15, and 34).</p>TABLE 7Binding Properties of Exemplary PD-L1 Binding DI-SLT-1A Fusion Prote"
