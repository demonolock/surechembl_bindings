For FIG. 1D, SK-N-MC/\u03b2-gal cells expressing human LGR8 were stimulated as in FIG. 1C. </p>FIG. 2 shows the amino acid sequences of human relaxin-3 and relaxin-3 chimeric polypeptides. A chimeric polypeptide is a hybrid molecule containing specific units from different proteins or polypeptides. All chimeric polypeptides depicted have the identical B-chain from human relaxin-3. The chimeric polypeptides R<sub>3</sub>/R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>3</sub>/R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3</sub>/I<sub>3</sub>, R<sub>3</sub>/I<sub>4</sub>, R<sub>3</sub>/I<sub>5</sub>, R<sub>3</sub>/I<sub>6</sub>, and R<sub>3</sub>/I possess A-chain sequences from human relaxin-1, relaxin-2, INSL3, INSL4, INSL5, INSL6, and insulin, respectively. R3/A possesses an A-chain in which the conserved cysteine residues are retained and the remainder of the amino acid sequence is arbitrarily assigned. </p>FIGS. 3A-3D illustrate the characterization of various relaxin-3 chimeric polypeptides using radioligand binding assays. Different relaxin-3 chimeric polypeptides were characterized for their receptor binding properties for human recombinant GPCR135 (FIG. 3A), GPCR142 (FIG. 3B), LGR7 (FIG. 3C), or LGR8 (FIG. 3D). For GPCR135, GPCR142, and LGR7, [<sup>125</sup>I]-relaxin-3 was used as the radioligand at a final concentration of 100 pM. Different unlabeled peptides were used in the binding assay as the competitors. For LGR8, [<sup>125</sup>I]-INSL3 was used as the radioligand at a final concentration of 100 pM. Different unlabeled peptides including relaxin-3 chimeras at various concentrations were added to the binding assay as the competitors. The IC50 values of different chimeras to different receptors are provided in Table 1 below. Data represent mean\u00b1SEM (n=3). </p>FIGS. 4A-4D illustrate the evaluation of the agonist activity of relaxin-3 chimeric polypeptides in biofunctional assays. Different chimeric polypeptides at various concentrations were added to SK-N-MC/\u03b2-gal cells expressing human GPCR135 (FIG. 4A) or GPCR142 (FIG. 4B) to inhibit forskolin stimulated \u03b2-galactosidase expression. Human relaxin-3 was used as the positive control. In parallel, chimeric polypeptides at various concentrations were added to SK-N-MC/\u03b2-gal cells expressing human LGR7 (FIG. 4C) and LGR8 (FIG. 4D) to stimulate \u03b2-galactosidase expression. Relaxin-3 and INSL3 were used as positive controls for LGR7 and LGR8, respectively. Intracellular \u03b2-galactosidase activity was measured by a colorimetric assay using CRGP as the substrate and reading the absorbance at wavelength of 570 nm. The EC<sub>50 </sub>values of different chimeras to the four receptors are listed in Table 2.

    ". </p> Monoclonal antibodies may be obtained by various techniques described in the art. To illustrate briefly, spleen cells from an animal immunized with a desired antigen may be immortalized, e.g., by fusion with a myeloma cell (see Kohler &amp; Milstein, Eur. J Immunol., 1976, 6:511-519). Alternative methods of immortalization include transformation with Epstein Barr Virus, oncogenes, or retroviruses. Colonies arising from single immortalized cells are screened for production of antibodies of the desired specificity and affinity for the antigen, and yield of the monoclonal antibodies produced by such cells may be enhanced by various techniques, including injection into the peritoneal cavity of a vertebrate host. Alternatively, one may isolate DNA sequences which encode a monoclonal antibody or a binding fragment thereof by screening a DNA library from human B cells according to the general protocol outlined by Huse et al., 1989, Science, 246:1275-1281. </p> Monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal sera may be collected and titered against the immunogen protein in an immunoassay, for example, a solid phase immunoassay with the immunogen immobilized on a solid support. To illustrate, polyclonal antisera with a titer of 10<sup>4 </sup>or greater are selected and tested for their cross-reactivity against unrelated proteins, or even related proteins from other organisms, using a competitive binding immunoassay. Specific polyclonal antisera and monoclonal antibodies may bind with a Kd of 1 \u03bcM, 0.1 \u03bcM or 0.01 \u03bcM or better. </p> Using anti-relaxin-3 chimeric polypeptide antibodies, individual relaxin-3 chimeric polypeptides can be detected by a variety of immunoassay methods. For a review of immunological and immunoassay procedures, see BASIC AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY (Stites &amp; Terr eds., 7th ed. 1991). Moreover, immunoassays can be performed in any of several configurations, which are reviewed extensively in ENZYME IMMUNOASSAY (Maggio, ed., 1980); and Harlow &amp; Lane, supra. </p> Biologically active relaxin-3 chimeric polypeptides can be detected and/or quantified using any of a number of known immunological binding assays (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,366,241; 4,376,110; 4,517,288; and 4,837,168). For a review of the general immunoassays, see also METHODS IN CELL BIOLOGY: ANTIBODIES IN CELL BIOLOGY, volume 37 (Asai, ed. 1993); BASIC AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY (Stites &amp; Terr, eds., 7th ed. 1991). Immunological binding assays (or immunoassays) generally use an antibody that specifically binds to a protein or antigen of choice (in this case a relaxin-3 chimeric polypeptide or an antigenic subsequence thereof). The antibody may be produced by any suitable means known in the art. </p> Immunoassays also may employ a labeling agent to specifically bind to and label the complex formed by the antibody and antigen. The labeling agent may itself be one of the moieties comprising the antibody/antigen complex. Thus, the labeling agent may be a labeled relaxin-3 ",

In another preferred exemplary embodiment, isolated membrane preparations comprising the at least one receptor can be used for the binding assay. In yet another preferred embodiment, a substantially purified extracellular fragment of the at least one receptor that is capable of binding to an inventive relaxin-3 chimeric polypeptide can be used for the binding assay. </p> The amount of the labeled ligand component or fragment thereof that binds to the at least one receptor can be measured by first separating the unbound labeled ligand component or fragment the at least one receptor, and then measuring the amount of labeling that is associated with the at least one receptor. </p> Separation of the at least one receptor protein from unbound labeled ligand components can be accomplished in a variety of ways. Conveniently, the at least one receptor may be immobilized on a solid substrate, from which the ligand component can be easily separated. The solid substrate can be made of a variety of materials and in a variety of shapes, e.g., microtiter plate, microbead, dipstick, and resin particle. The substrate preferably is chosen to maximize signal-to-noise ratios, primarily to minimize background binding, as well as for ease of separation and cost. </p> Separation can be effected by, for example, removing a bead or dipstick from a reservoir, emptying or diluting a reservoir such as a microtiter plate well, or rinsing a bead, particle, chromatographic column or filter with a wash solution or solvent. The separation step preferably includes multiple rinses or washes. For example, when the solid substrate is a microtiter plate, the wells can be washed several times with a washing solution, e.g., that includes those components of the incubation mixture that do not participate in specific bindings, such as salts, buffer, detergent, no",
    "ashed with cold washing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA). Microscint-40 was added to each well and the bound [<sup>125</sup>I,]-relaxin-3 was counted in a scintillation counter (TopCount/NTX, Packard). </p> Radioligand binding assays for LGR7 and LGR8 were performed using live COS-7 cells transiently transfected with LGR7 or LGR8 expression plasmids in 15-cm culture dishes using LipofectAmine (Invitrogen). Two days after transfection, the transfected cells were detached from the 15-cm culture dished using phosphate buffered saline (PBS) plus 10 mM EDTA, seeded into 96-well opaque poly-D-lysine coated culture plates and used for radioligand binding assays. For LGR7, [<sup>125</sup>I]-relaxin-3 was used as the tracer. For LGR8, [<sup>125</sup>I]-INSL3 (specific activity: 2200 Ci/mmol) was used as the tracer. [<sup>125</sup>I]-labeled tracer was added in binding reactions at a final concentration of 100 pM in binding buffer containing DMEM plus 50 mM HEPES and 1% bovine serum albumin. Unlabeled relaxin-3 and relaxin-3 chimeric polypeptides were added at various concentrations to the binding assays as the competitors, as indicated (FIG. 3). The binding mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. The unbound radioligand was removed by aspiration of the binding buffer. The cells were washed with PBS. The bound radioligand was counted in a scintillation counter (TopCount/NTX). The results were analyzed using Prism 3.0 program (Graphpad, San Diego, Calif.). The IC50 values represent the ligand concentrations that inhibit 50% of the maximum specific binding. </p> The IC<sub>50 </sub>values of different chimeric polypeptides for GPCR135, GPCR142, LGR7, and LGR8 are listed in Table 1. </p> The results showed that all chimeric polypeptides, except R<sub>3</sub>/I<sub>4</sub>, bound both GPCR135 and GPCR142 with high affinity (i.e., IC<sub>50 </sub>values in the low nanomolar range), but with slight differences in potency. R<sub>3</sub>/I<sub>4 </sub>demonstrated marginal binding at the highest concentration (1 \u03bcM). Chimeric polypeptides R<sub>3</sub>/R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>3</sub>/R<sub>2</sub>, and R<sub>3</sub>/I<sub>3</sub>, bound to LGR7 with IC<sub>50 </sub>values in low nanomolar range, which is similar to that of relaxin-3.

The R<sub>3</sub>/I<sub>5 </sub>chimeric polypeptide, which demonstrated affinity for GPCR135 and GPCR142 in the subnanomolar and low nanomolar range, respectively, showed lower affinity for LGR7, with an IC<sub>50 </sub>value of about 0.5 \u03bcM. R<sub>3</sub>/I<sub>4 </sub>was inactive for LGR7 even at the highest concentration tested (1 \u03bcM). None of the chimeric polypeptides bound LGR8 with high affinity.
