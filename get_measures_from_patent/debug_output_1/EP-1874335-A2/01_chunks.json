    " five, six, seven, eight or more nucleotides in length.</p>A \"recombinant helper nucleic acid\" or more simply \"helper nucleic acid\" is a nucleic acid which encodes functional components that allow a second nucleic acid to be encapsidated in a capsid. Typically, in the context of the present invention, the helper plasmid, or other nucleic acid, encodes viral functions and structural proteins which allow a recombinant viral vector to be encapsidated into a capsid. In one preferred embodiment, a recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) helper nucleic acid is a plasmid encoding AAV polypeptides, and lacking the AAV ITR regions. For example, in one embodiment, the helper plasmid encodes the AAV genome, with the exception of the AAV ITR regions, which are replaced with adenovirus ITR sequences. This permits replication and encapsidation of the AAV replication defective recombinant vector, while preventing generation of wild-type AAV virus, e.g., by recombination. A \"regulatory nucleic acid\" or \"regulatory sequence\" includes any nucleic acid that can exert an effect on the transcription of an operably linked open reading frame. A regulatory nucleic acid may be a core promoter, an enhancer or repressor element, a complete transcriptional regulatory region or a functional portion of any of the preceding. Mutant versions of the preceding may also be considered regulatory nucleic acids.</p>The term \"small molecule\" refers to a compound, which has a molecular weight of less than about 5 kD, less than about 2.5 kD, less than about 1.5 IcD, or less than about 0.9 IcD. Small molecules may be, for example, nucleic acids, peptides, polypeptides, peptide nucleic acids, peptidomimetics, carbohydrates, lipids or other organic (carbon containing) or inorganic molecules. Many pharmaceutical companies have extensive libraries of chemical and/or biological mixtures, often fungal, bacterial, or algal extracts, which can be screened using any of the methods described herein. The term \"small organic molecule\" refers to a small molecule that is often identified as being an organic or medicinal compound, and does not include molecules that are exclusively nucleic acids, peptides or polypeptides. \n\n The term \"test compound\" refers to a molecule to be tested by one or more screening method(s) as a putative modulator of gene expression. The term \"control test compound\" refers to a compound having a known effect on gene expression from a given nucleic acid construct. For example, a control test compound may activate gene expression from a given promoter, inhibit gene expression from a given promoter, or have no effect on gene expression from a given promoter. In certain embodiments, various predetermined concentrations of test compounds are used for screening such as 0.01 \u03bcM, 0.1 \u03bcM, 1.0 \u03bcM and 10.0 \u03bcM. Examples of test compounds include, but are not limited to, peptides, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and small molecules.</p>The term \"toxicity marker gene promoter\" refers to the upstream regulatory reg",
    " iron-binding polypeptide is used, it is preferable if the polypeptide retains the iron in the nontoxic Fe(III) oxidation state. Fe(II) is also an effective contrasting agent, but Fe(II) may participate in the iron-catalyzed Fenton reaction that yields potentially damaging hydroxyl radicals.</p>In a preferred embodiment, a direct contrast protein of the invention has the following properties: rapid intracellular protein assembly and metal loading, the tendency to promote formation of a metal-rich aggregate that has a large paramagnetic susceptibility, and the ability to retain the metal in a relatively nontoxic form (e.g. in the case of iron, the Fe(III) state).</p>In certain aspects, metal-binding polypeptides may also change the contrast properties of a cell by perturbing metal metabolism and stimulating the expression of endogenous metal-binding polypeptides that have contrast effects. This may also lead to an accumulation or depletion of a particular metal in the cell. For example, transient expression of high affinity iron-binding proteins may create a temporary decrease in the intracellular labile iron pool and stimulate production of transferrin receptor, thereby increasing the net iron uptake into the cell. Although the exact binding affinity of a metal-binding protein for different metals is not critical, it is generally expected that polypeptides with a sub-nanomolar affinity for one or more effective metals may be useful, and optionally the polypeptide will have a dissociation constant less than 10<sup>\"15</sup> M, 10<sup>\"20</sup> M, or less for one or more effective metals. It is understood that many metal binding proteins will bind to more than one type of metal. For example, lactoferrin will form complexes with metals such as manganese and zinc. Ferritin-iron complexes are generally expected to contain some small (perhaps infinitesimal) amounts of other metals, hi general, iron binding proteins are likely to bind to metals such as manganese, cobalt, zinc and chromium, although in vivo the concentration and abundance of iron is so much higher than these other metals that an iron binding protein will be primarily associated with iron. \n\n Several exemplary metal-binding polypeptides of the invention are provided. This is in no way intended to be an exhaustive list, and, in view of the teachings herein, one of skill in the art will be able to identify or design other useful metal- binding polypeptides. In certain exemplary embodiments, one or more ferritins may be used as a contrast protein. Ferritins of the invention include any of the group of diiron- carboxylate proteins characterized by the tendency to form a dimeric or multimeric structure with bound iron and having a helix-bundle structure comprising an iron-coordinating GIu residue in a first helix and a Glu-X-X-His motif in a second. Certain ferritins maintain bound iron in a primarily Fe(III) form. A list of exemplary ferritins is provided in Table 2. This list is intended to ",
    "ene of wheat. Other suitable promoters will be known to the skilled artisan, such as, for example, the promoters of gliadin, branching enzyme, ADPG pyrophosphorylase, starch synthase and actin. In still another embodiment, externally regulatable promoters may be used, such as, for example, promoters responsive to chemical exposure, temperature, or developmental signals.</p>In other embodiments, strong and non tissue- or developmental-specific plant promoters (e.g., a promoter that strongly expresses in many or all plant tissue types) may be used in accordance with the methods and compositions described herein. Examples of such strong, \"constitutive\" promoters include, but are not limited to, the CaMV 35S promoter (Odell et al., 1985, Nature 313:810-812), the T-DNA mannopine synthetase promoter, and their various derivatives. In another embodiment, an inducible or repressible promoter may be used, such as, for example, a tet operator promoter as described in Weinrnann et al., 1994, Plant J. 5:559-569; or a glucocorticoid-inducible promoter as described in McNellis et al., 1998, Plant J. 14:247-257; or an ethanol inducible promoter as described in Caddick et al., 1998, Nature Biotechnology 16:177-180. See, also, Gatz, 1995, Methods in Cell Biology 50:411-424, which describes inducible and repressible gene expression \n\nsystems for plants. For plastid transformation, strong promoters such as the promoter (P<sub>ps</sub>bA) of psbA, the plastid gene encoding the photosystem II 32 kD protein, may be used.</p>Plants and plant cells may be transformed using any method known in the art. In one embodiment, Agrobacterium is employed to introduce the gene construct into plants. Such transformation typically uses binary Agrobacterium T-DNA vectors (Bevan, 1984, Nuc. Acid Res. 12:8711-8721), and the co-cultivation procedure (Horsch et al, 1985, Science 227:1229-1231). Generally, the Agrobacterium transformation system is used to engineer dicotyledonous plants (Bevan et al., 1982, Ann. Rev. Genet 16:357-384; Rogers et al., 1986, Methods Enzymol. 118:627-641). The Agrobacterium transformation system may also be used to transform, as well as transfer, DNA to monocotyledonous plants and plant cells, (see Hernalsteen et al., 1984, EMBO J 3:3039-3041; Hooykaas-Van Slogteren et al., 1984, Nature 311:763-764; Grimsley et al., 1987, Nature 325:1677-179; Boulton et al., 1989, Plant MoI. Biol. 12:31-40; and Gould et al., 1991, Plant Physiol. 95:426-434).</p>In other embodiments, various alternative methods for introducing recombinant nucleic acid constructs into plants and plant cells may also be utilized. These other methods are particularly useful where the target is a monocotyledonous plant or plant cell. Alternative gene transfer and transformation methods include, but are not limited to, particle gun bombardment (biolistics), protoplast transformation through calcium-, polyethylene glycol (PEG)- or electroporation-mediated uptake of naked DNA (see Paszkowski et al.,"
