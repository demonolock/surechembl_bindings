For an antibody that specifically binds to its antigen, this will include at least part of at least one of its CDR domains. Antigen binding domains from anti-CD38 variant antibodies are described herein. </p> [00109] The terms \"specific binding\", \"specifically binds\" or \"specifically binding\" and other related terms, as used herein in the context of an antibody or antigen binding protein or antibody fragment, refer to non-covalent or covalent preferential binding to an antigen relative to other molecules or moieties (e.g., an antibody specifically binds to a particular antigen relative to other available antigens). In one embodiment, an antibody specifically binds to a target antigen if it binds to the antigen with a dissociation constant KD of 10 <sup>5</sup> M or less, or 10 <sup>6</sup> M or less, or 10 <sup>7</sup> M or less, or 10 <sup>8</sup> M or less, or 10 <sup>9</sup> M or less, or 10 <sup>10</sup> M or less.

    " Anti-human Fc antibody from Human Antibody Capture Kit (catalog # BR-1008-39, from GE Healthcare) was immobilized on a Series S Sensor Chip CM5 (catalog # BR-1005-30, GE Healthcare) to approximately 5000 resonance units (RU) using standard N- Hydroxysuccinimide/1 -ethyl-3 -(-3 -dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride </p>(NHS/EDC) coupling methodology. Anti-CD38 antibodies (approximately 2 pg/rnL) were captured for 60 seconds at a flow rate of approximately 10 pL/minute. Recombinant human his- tagged CD38 protein (from Sino Biological, catalog # 10818-H08H) was serially diluted in running buffer of 0.01 M HEPES pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.05% v/v Surfactant P20 (HBS EP+). All measurements were conducted in HBS-EP+ buffer with a flow rate of 30 pL/minute. Surfaces were regenerated with 3M MgCb for 60 seconds. A 1 : 1 (Langmuir) binding model was used to fit the data. The SPR senorgrams are shown in Figure 1 (Daratumumab, \n\n from Janssen Biotech), Figure 2 (parent antibody A2), Figure 3 (variant antibody 3H10ml), Figure 4 (variant antibody 3G3), and Figure 5 (variant antibody 3E10). The results of the binding assays, including binding kinetics, are summarized in the table shown in Figure 6. The binding assays show that the variant antibodies 3E10, 3G3 and 3H10ml exhibit improved affinity to CD38 protein compared to the parent antibody A2, and these variant antibodies exhibit higher affinity for CD38 protein compared to Daratumumab, as indicated by their measured KD values. </p> [00238] Surface plasmon resonance was also used to rank affinities of six variant antibodies (variant antibody 3E10 was not included in this analysis). The SPR sensorgram at Figure 17 shows the ranked order, from highest to lowest affinity, 3G3 &gt; 3H10 &gt; 3H10ml &gt; 3E11 &gt;</p>3E3ml &gt; 3G8ml. </p> [00239] Example 2: Comparative cell binding analysis of parent antibody A2 and variant antibodies. </p> [00240] The capability of the parent antibody A2, variant antibodies and Daratumumab to bind non-activated or activated T cells, was measured using flow cytometry. Serial dilutions of the antibodies, at 10 pg/mL, 1 pg/mL or 0.1 pg/mL, were added to lxlO<sup>5</sup> human T cells (non- activated or activated) in a final volume of 100 pL of PBS + 2% FCS in the well of a 96-well plate. After 15 minutes at 4 \u00b0C, the wells were washed with a solution of PBS + 2% FCS. The cells were resuspended in a 100 pL solution of PBS + 2% FCS containing the APC-labeled goat anti-human IgG at a final concentration of 1 : 1,000. After 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C, the cells were washed with a solution of PBS + 2% FCS and then resuspended in 150 pL of PBS + 2% FCS for analysis by flow cytometry. Controls for these cell binding assays included (1) T cells incubated with an irrelevant isotype control antibody followed by incubation with the APC-labeled goat anti-human IgG, and (2) T cells stained with an antiCD47 antibody. The results shown in </p>Figures 7, 8A and 8B demonstrate that vari",

The antibody serial dilutions were \n\n prepared as described in Example 2 above. The diluted antibodies were added to lxlO<sup>5</sup> RPMI 8226 cells in a manner similar to the procedure described in Example 2 above. The results in Figure 9 demonstrate that variant antibodies 3H10ml, 3G3 and 3E10 exhibit improved cell binding capabilities compared to parent antibody A2 at all concentrations tested, and these variant antibodies have cell binding capabilities that are comparable to Daratumumab. </p> [00243] Example 4: Comparative cell binding analysis of parent antibody A2 and variant antibodies. </p> [00244] The capability of the parent antibody A2, variant antibodies, and Daratumumab to bind B lymphoma cells, was measuring using flow cytometry. Serial dilutions of the antibodies, at 10 pg/mL, 1 pg/mL, 0.1 pg/mL or 0.01 pg/mL, were prepared as described in Example 2 above. The diluted antibodies were added to lxlO<sup>5</sup> Raji (Figure 9) or Ramos (Figure 10) cells in a manner similar to the procedure described in Example 2 above. </p> [00245] The results in Figure 10 and Table 3 below show that the EC50 of variant antibody 3H10ml is lower than that of the parent antibody A2 when binding to Raji cells and is comparable to the EC50 of Daratumumab. </p> [00246] The results in Figure 11 and Table 4 below show that the EC50 of variant antibody 3H10ml is lower than that of the parent antibody A2 when binding to Ramos cells and is comparable to the EC50 of Daratumumab. </p>[00247] Table 3: \n<img id=\"imgf000089_0001\" path=\"imgf000089_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/777192280/WO/20201008/A1/002020/20/54/99/imgf000089_0001.tif\"/>\n </p>[00248] Table 4: \n<img id=\"imgf000089_0002\" path=\"imgf000089_0002.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/777192277/WO/20201008/A1/002020/20/54/99/imgf000089_0002.tif\"/>\n </p>[00249] Example 5: Comparative cell binding analysis of parent antibody A2 and variant antibodies. </p> [00250] The capability of the parent antibody A2, variant antibodies, and Daratumumab to bind primary T cells was measuring using flow cytometry. Serial dilutions of the antibodies, at \n\n 10 pg/mL, 1 pg/mL, 0.1 pg/mL or 0.01 pg/mL, were prepared as described in Example 2 above. The diluted antibodies were added to lxlO<sup>5</sup> human primary T cells (Figure 12) in a manner similar to the procedure described in Example 2 above. </p> [00251] The results in Figure 12 and Table 5 below show that the EC50 of variant antibodies 3H10ml and 3G3 is lower than that of the parent antibody A2 when binding to primary T cells but not as low as the EC50 of Daratumumab. </p> [00252] Table 5: \n<img id=\"imgf000090_0001\" path=\"imgf000090_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/777192273/WO/20201008/A1/002020/20/54/99/imgf000090_0001.tif\"/>\n </p>[00253] Example 6: Cross-reactivity analysis of parent antibody A2 and Daratumumab. </p>[00254] The capability of parent antibody A2 and Daratumumab to bind to murine and cynomolgus CD38 protein was analyzed. A 96-well Ni-NTA plate was used to capture 50 pL recombinant human (Sino Biological, catalog # 10818-H08H), mouse (Sino Biological, catalog # 50191-M08H), or cynomolgus (Sino Biological, catalog # 90050-C08H) CD38/His-tag (1 pg/mL in PBS). After incubating for 30 minutes at room temperature, the wells were washed 3 times with PBS-0.05%Tween 20 (PBST). 50 pL of the antibody (about 1 pg/mL) diluted in Casein were added and incubated for 30 minutes with shaking at room temperature. The plate was washed 3 times with PBST followed by a 30 minute incubation with 50 pL horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-human Fc (1 : 1000 in casein) for 30 minutes. After washing, 25 pL 3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate was added and developed for 30 minutes at room temperature. 25 pL 2M EbSCri was used to stop the reaction and the OD was read at 450 nm. The graph shown in Figure 13 shows that the parent antibody A2 and </p>Daratumumab bind human CD38 protein but not murine CD38 protein.
