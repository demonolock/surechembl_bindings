As the protein, human 14-3-3\u03b6 protein expressed and purified from E. coli was used. Peptide having the sequence of FAM-RSHpSX- <sub>COOH</sub> or FAM-RSHpSXP- <sub>COOH</sub> (FAM; 5-carboxyfluorescein-aminohexyl, pS; phosphorylated serine, X; any amino acid) Was used. Concentration of 14-3-3 protein in each well of a 384-well microplate so that the final concentration of fluorescently labeled phosphopeptide 1.0 nmol / L, fusicoccin derivative 0.50 \u03bcmol / L or 100 \u03bcmol / L, DMSO 8% (v / v) Were prepared, and the fluorescence polarization intensity was measured (excitation wavelength 470 nm and fluorescence wavelength 535 nm). With respect to the plots obtained in the presence of the fusicoccin derivative and in the DMSO control, titration curve fitting was performed in the one site bind mode of the graph analysis software sigma plot, and the dissociation constant between the protein and the phosphorylated peptide was calculated. The dissociation constant K <sub>Dpep</sub> peptides calculated in DMSO control using the dissociation constant K <sub>Dapp</sub> divided by the value S = K <sub>Dpep</sub> / K <sub>Dapp</sub> apparent obtained in the presence Fusicoccin derivative as an indicator of protein-protein interactions stabilize. FIG. 1 shows the PPI stabilization effect of the phosphopeptides FAM-RSHpSV 2 <sub>-COOH</sub> and 14-3-3\u03b6 protein in the presence of 0.50 \u03bcM of each fusicoccin compound. Table 1 shows the PPI stabilization effect of fusicoccin compounds 1 and 3 in the presence of 100 \u03bcM of a plurality of phosphorylated peptides. In addition, Table 2 shows the PPI stabilization effect of the phosphopeptides FAM-RSHpSV- <sub>COOH</sub> and 14-3-3\u03b6 protein in the presence of 100 \u03bcM of the fusicoccin compound 22 and fusicoccin A aglycon (fusicoccin compound 23).</p><img id=\"\" path=\"JPOXMLDOC01-appb-T000038.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/450875348/WO/20180809/A1/002018/14/31/40/JPOXMLDOC01-appb-T000038.tif\"/></p><img id=\"\" path=\"JPOXMLDOC01-appb-T000039.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/450875356/WO/20180809/A1/002018/14/31/40/JPOXMLDOC01-appb-T000039.tif\"/></p>Test Example 2: Ovarian cancer cell OVCAR3 growth inhibitory activity test in combination with interferon alpha (Cancer Lett., 293, 198-206, (2010).) . Specifically, the test was conducted as follows.  1. Ovarian cancer cells OVCAR3 were cultured to 80-90% confluent (medium; RPMI1640, 10% FCS).  2. The medium of OVCAR3 was discarded and washed with (\u2212) PBS (8 mL \u00d7 1).  3. (-) PBS"
