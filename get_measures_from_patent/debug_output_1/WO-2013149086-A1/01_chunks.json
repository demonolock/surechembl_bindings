    "nding to PDGF with PDGF aptamer 4149-8_260. In some embodiments, a PDGF aptamer binds to PDGF-B with less than 15%, less than 14%, less than 13%, leass than 12%, less than 11%, less than 10%, less than 9%, less than 8%, less than 7%, or less than 6% polar contacts to protein contact atoms. Polar contacts are defined as the sum of hydrogen bonds and charge-charge interactions. In some embodiments, a PDGF aptamer binds to PDGF-B with a ratio of polar contacts to interface area of less than 0.01, less than 0.009, less than 0.008, less \n\n than 0.007, or less than 0.006. In some embodiments, a PDGF aptamer binds to the same region of a PDGF-B monomer (in the context of a PDGF-BB or PDGF-AB dimer) as PDGF aptamer 5169-4_26. </p> [00141] In some embodiments, a PDGF aptamer has any combination of the following characteristics: </p> (a) binds to a region of PDGF-B comprising amino acids 24 to 86 of PDGF-B;</p>(b) competes for binding to PDGF with PDGF aptamer 4149-8_260; </p> (c) competes for binding to PDGF with PDGF aptamer 5169-4_26; </p> (d) binds to PDGF-B with a ratio of polar contacts to interface area of less than 0.01, less than 0.009, less than 0.008, less than 0.007, or less than 0.006; and/or</p>(e) binds to PDGF-B with less than 15%, less than 14%, less than 13%, leass than 12%, less than 11%, less than 10%, less than 9%, less than 8%, less than 7%, or less than 6% polar contacts to protein contact atoms. </p> [00142] The PDGF aptamer can be selected to have any suitable dissociation constant (\u00be) for PDGF. In some embodiments, a PDGF aptamer has a dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) for PDGF of less than 30 nM, less than 25 nM, less than 20 nM, less than 15 nM, less than 10 nM, less than 9 nM, less than 8 nM, less than 7 nM, less than 6 nM, less than 5 nM, less than 4 nM, less than 3 nM, less than 2 nM, or less than 1 nM. Dissociation constants may be determined with a binding assay using a multi-point titration and fitting the equation y = (max - min)(Protein)/(K<sub>d</sub> + Protein) + min as described in Example 3, below. In some embodiments, the PDGF aptamer is an aptamer with a K<sub>d</sub> that is less than or equal to the K<sub>d</sub> of an aptamer shown in any one of Tables 1, 2 or 6 to 9. In some embodiments, the PDGF aptamer is an aptamer with a K<sub>d</sub> that is less than or equal to the K<sub>d</sub> of an aptamer shown in Table 1 or Table 6. </p> [00143] Aptamer 4149-8_1 binds in a 1: 1 stoichiometry with a PDGF monomer. Since PDGF forms a tight homodimer that is required for reaction with its target receptors, a more efficient inhibition of PDGF activity might be achieved by using a dimeric or other multimeric form of aptamer 4149-8_1. Thus, in some embodiments, the PDGF aptamer is a multimerization of any combination of the sequences of aptamer 4149-8_1, 4149-8_379, and SEQ ID NOS 500 to 512. In some embodiments, an aptamer construct comprises a first aptamer selected from any of the PDGF aptamers described herein, and a second aptamer comprising any of the PDGF aptamers described herein, wherein the first aptamer and the second aptamer may be the same or different. The first aptamer and the second aptamer of the PDGF aptamer construct may be covalently or noncovalently linked. Nonlimiting \n\n exemplary linkages are known in the art and/or are described herein.

In some embodiments, a VEGF aptamer binds to the same region of a VEGF-121 as a VEGF aptamer shown in Table 10, 11, 12, 13 or 14 that have a K<sub>d</sub> of less than 10 nM. In some embodiments, a VEGF aptamer binds to the same region of VEGF-121 as VEGF aptamer 4867-31_183. </p> [00163] The VEGF aptamer can be selected to have any suitable dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) for VEGF. In some embodiments, a VEGF aptamer has a dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) for VEGF-121 of less than 30 nM, less than 25 nM, less than 20 nM, less than 15 nM, less than 10 nM, less than 9 nM, less than 8 nM, less than 7 nM, less than 6 nM, less than 5 nM, less than 4 nM, less than 3 nM, less than 2 nM, or less than 1 nM.

The first aptamer and the second aptamer of the VEGF aptamer construct may be covalently or noncovalently linked. Nonlimiting exemplary linkages are known in the art and/or are described herein. In some embodiments, a VEGF aptamer construct may be capable of binding two VEGF monomers simultaneously. In some embodiments, a VEGF aptamer construct binds VEGF with an affinity (K<sub>d</sub>) of less than 10 nM. </p>EXEMPLARY PDGF/VEGF APTAMER CONSTRUCTS </p> [00165] There is considerable evidence that more efficient blocking of tumor- associated and ocular angiogenesis, coupled with new blood vessel regression, is possible with combined inhibition of VEGF and PDGF-B signaling pathways (Bergers, G., et al. (2003) J. Clin. Invest. 111: 1287; Jo, N., et al. (2006) Am. J. Pathol. 168:2036). This effect is mediated by \n\n the disruption of tight cell-cell association between endothelial cells, which form initial capillary sprouts, and periendothelial cells (or pericytes), which encircle the new blood vessels as they mature, rendering the blood vessels less susceptible to VEGF inhibitors (Benjamin, L. E., et al. (1998) Development 125: 1591; Benjam",
    " performed another series of systematic point substitutions by chemically synthesizing 5-position variants with a custom-made library of modified dU phosphoramidites. For this purpose, we designed a library to allow us to probe the microenvironment of each of the positions by varying the size, polarity, disposition of H-bond donors and acceptors, linker length, and orientation of the 5-position substituents. In choosing the functional groups for this analysis, we aimed to include variations on a theme of the original modification (in this case, the benzyl group), amino acid side chains overrepresented in complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of antibodies (like tryptophan and tyrosine) (Mian, IS, et al. (1991) J. Mol. Biol. 217:133; </p>Ramaraj T. et al. (2012) Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1824:520), and \"privileged\" fragments of small-molecule drugs (Welsch et al. (2010) Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 14:347). In a sense, we endeavored to combine elements of affinity maturation in antibodies and structure- activity relationship (SAR) optimization in medicinal chemistry. Although we utilized a single modified nucleotide during SELEX, post-SELEX optimization is constrained only by the synthetic accessibility of the modified monomers and compatibility with solid-phase synthesis. </p> [00205] The effect of individual substitutions of the benzyl group with fourteen alternative moieties at the 5-position is summarized in FIGS. 1C and D, and FIG. 6B, with relative affinities expressed as dissociation constant ratios and relative PDGF Rp phosphorylation expressed as percent phospho-PDGF Rp ratios. Substitution with dT, which only has a methyl group at the 5-position, represents the most drastic change, and in that sense is comparable to alanine scanning mutagenesis in proteins (Cunningham, B.C. et al. (1989) Science 243: 1330). Not surprisingly, this was the least tolerated substitution at six of the eight modified nucleotide positions. The exceptions were nucleotides 1 and 7, where this substitution was well-tolerated. These two positions also tolerated many other substitutions, with some replacements yielding up to 5-fold improvement in binding affinity (FIG. 6B). In contrast, nucleotides 8, 17 and 18 exhibited the highest sensitivity to changes. The best single substitutions were then combined, yielding additional variants including 4149-8_255 and 4149-8_260 (FIG. 6B). Aptamer 4149-8_260, which combined phenethyl-dU (Pe-dU) at nucleotide 17 and thiophene-dU (Th-dU) at nucleotide 18, showed excellent binding to both PDGF-BB and PDGF-AB (FIG. 6B). It is worth noting that the affinity of the originally selected SOMAmer was already so high pM) that it approached the detection limit of the binding assay, so it is possible that the degree of affinity improvement is underestimated. \n\n We have applied similar post-SELEX optimization strategies to other SOMAmers with weaker initial binding (e.g., K<sub>&lt;</sub>j values ranging from 100 pM to &gt;10 nM), and have observed affinity improvements of up to 100-fold. </p> [00206] Homodimers of PDGF aptamer 4149-8_260 (SL5): Since PDGF forms a covalently linked homodimer, and two SOMAmers bind to each PDGF homodimer, we determined the effect on binding of homodimerized SOMAmers. The affinity of the PDGF aptamer homodimers could be substantially improved compared to the affinity of the corresponding monomers, due to avidity effects. The crystal structure showed that the 5' ends of the SOMAmer were 38 A apart, while the 3' ends were 74 A apart. Connecting the 5' to 3' end would require at least 63 A since the shortest path between the two points bisected the protein. Two types of homodimers were ordered, based on readily available chemistry. These were 1) head- to-tail homodimers connected by two to six Heg linkers, which provide</p>-20 A distance per Heg, and 2) 3'-3' homodimers connected via a synthetic doubler support, combined with one to three Hegs. The homodimers of 4149-8_260 were tested in the PDGF- BB Zorbax binding assay. The binding assay was performed with limiting amount of SOMAmer, and would not distinguish binding of one SOMAmer per protein dimer versus binding of two SOMAmers per protein dimer. The structure of the homodimers is shown in Table 1 (sequences 4149-8_334 through 4149-8_342). The K<sub>&lt;</sub>j values obtained in the Zorbax assay suggested that in the 5' to 3' configuration, a longer linker was desirable, and gave up to 10-fold improvement in binding affinity, as shown in Table la. In the 3'-3' linked </p>homodimers, the shorter linker actually appeared to perform better than the longer linker. This was corroborated by cellular phosphorylation results, see Table la. </p>[00207] Based on these sequences, an exemplary consensus sequence is: </p>5'-ZZVCL<sub>n</sub>GV'ZACNMGCGZZZAZAGCG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 502), </p>wherein </p> V is selected from an A, C or G; </p> V is selected from a C, G or Z, wherein V is complementary to V; </p> N is independently selected from any naturally occurring or modified nucleotide; </p>M is selected from a C or A; </p> Z is independently selected from a modified pyrimidine; L is a spacer selected from any naturally occurring or modified nucleotide, a hydrocarbon linker, a polyethylene glycol linker or a combination thereof; and </p>n is 0 to 20; </p>wherein one or more nucleotide insertions are optionally included. \n\n [00208] Sequence Truncation Studies: Systematic truncation from the 5' and 3' ends of 4149-8_1 was performed to define a minimum length r",
    "etermination is shown in FIG. 17 for VEGF aptamers 4867-31_43 and 4867-31_192, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 2.2 nM and 2.1 nM, respectively. </p> [00254] For activity screening of variants of clone 4867-31, we have evaluated percent inhibition of VEGF-induced VEGF R2 phosphorylation in HUVECs, under the same conditions as described above but at a single concentration of SOMAmer variants (generally 20 nM). </p> Example 10. Homodimer Constructs of PDGF and VEGF Aptamers </p>[00255] Both PDGF-BB and VEGF are disulfide linked homodimers that exert their biological effects by dimerizing their tyrosine kinase receptors leading to receptor </p>autophosphorylation and signal transduction. If more than one aptamer can bind to its protein target, as is the case with PDGF-BB aptamer 4149-8_260 (based on the crystal structures), such aptamers can be covalently linked in a multimeric construct in a manner that permits simultaneous binding of individual aptamer subunits to the protein. This can lead to improvement in affinity through avidity effect. Two types of homodimers were synthesized, based on readily available chemistry. These were 1) head- to-tail homodimers connected by zero to six Heg linkers, which provide -20 A distance per Heg, and 2) 3'-3' homodimers connected via a synthetic doubler support, combined with one to three Hegs on each side (that is, two, four or six Hegs total in the dimer). The homodimers of 4149-8_379, 5169- 4_26 and 4867-31_192 were tested in a competition binding assay. For determination of competitor binding affinities, aptamer ligands were 5' end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and \u03b3- 32 P-ATP (Perkin Elmer). Competition assays were performed by pre-mixing a fixed concentration of radiolabeled ligand (1.0 nM) with varying concentrations of competitor aptamer (10 <sup>11</sup> to 10<sup>\"6</sup> M). The ligand and competitor dilutions were incubated with the target protein (100 pM) in 1XSB18T buffer (40 mM HEPES, pH 7.5; 120 mM NaCl; 5 mM KC1; 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.01% TWEEN-20) at 37\u00b0C for 60 minutes. \n\n Bound complexes were mixed with Zorbax resin and captured on Durapore filter plates. The fraction of ligand bound was quantified with a Phosphorlmager (FUJI FLA-3000). Raw binding data were normalized to binding without addition of competitor. Data were plotted in GraphPad Prism 3.0 and fit to a one site competition curve using nonlinear regression to determine the equilibrium dissociation constants for the competitor aptamers (K<sub>;</sub>). PDGF Homodimers: The structure of the PDGF homodimers of sequences 4149-8_379 (sequences 4149-8_438 through 4149-8_447) and 5169-4_26 (sequences 5169-4_134 through 5169- 4_143) are shown in Table 15. For the 4149-8_379 based homodimers, the Kj values obtained in the competition assay suggested that in the 5' to 3' configuration, a longer linker was desirable, since a greater than 10-fold improvement in binding affinity was measured with five Heg linkers compared to no Heg linker (0.25 pM vs 4.2 pM, respectively). In the 3' to 3' linked 4149-8_379 homodimers, the longer four and six Heg linkers also performed at least 10-fold better than no linker and approximately 2-fold better than the two Heg linkers. For the 5169-4_26 based homodimers, the K; values indicated a longer Heg linker was advantageous in the 5' to 3' configuration, since the Kj imporved from 28 pM for no Heg linker to 3.6 pM for six Heg linkers. There was no difference in the Kj values for five and six Heg linkers in the 5' to 3' configuration. In the 3' to 3' linked 5169-4_26 based homodimers the same pattern was observed, with the K; improving as the Heg linker length increased. The six Heg linker showed a 5-fold improvement in the Ki compared to no Heg linker (2.0 pM vs. 11 pM, respectively).

PDGF/VEGF Heterodimer Aptamer Constructs </p>[00256] Heterodimers based on PDGF aptamer 4149-8 and VEGF aptamer 4867-31.</p>With the aim of developing constructs with specificity for PDGF and VEGF, we designed and tested a variety of aptamer constructs comprising a VEGF aptamer linked to a PDGF aptamer. The first aptamer constructs tested combined PDGF variant 4149-8_273 and VEGF 4867-31_183. Aptamer constructs were synthesized head-to-tail, connected by zero to three hexaethylene glycol (Heg) linkers, in both orientations (either with the PDGF aptamer at the 5' end or VEGF aptamer at the 5' end). The results are shown in Table 17 and 18 below.

Similarly, aptamer construct 4149-8_401 inhibited VEGF-induced VEGFR2 phosphorylation in HUVEC cells with comparable potency to that of the VEGF monomer 4867-31_192 (IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.7 nM and 2.1 nM, respectively).

We have designed and tested additional heterodimer constructs based on the variants of PDGF aptamer 5169-4_26 and VEGF aptamer 4867-31_192. Aptamer constructs were synthesized head-to-tail, connected by one to six hexaethylene glycol (Heg) linkers, in both orientations (either with the PDGF aptamer at the 5' end or VEGF aptamer at the 5' end). The results are shown in Table 22. With VEGF at the 5' end Heg linkers between three and six resulted in the highest affinities. The affinites in general were slightly lower when the VEGF-121 aptamer sequence was on the 3' end, with most Kd values falling in the 100-300 pM range, except for the five Heg linker sequence which had a Kd of 56 pM. With PDGF at the 5' end, the Kd values ranged from 11 pM for three Heg linkers to 0.54 pM for four Heg linkers, with the remaing Kd values falling in between for all other Heg linker lengths. When PDGF was at the 3' end there was a trend towards higher binding affinity as the linker length increased, with one Heg linker having a Kd of 5.3 pM and six Heg linkers having a Kd of 0.20 pM. In Table 22, \"P\" denotes Nap-dU, superscript \"1\" denotes 2'-0-methyl substitution, no superscript denotes deoxyribonucleotides and \"H\" denotes hexaethylene glycol (Heg) linker. </p>Example 12. Simultaneous Binding of PDGF/VEGF Aptamer Constructs to VEGF and PDGF </p> [00263] To demonstrate the ability of the PDGF/VEGF aptamer constructs to bind VEGF and PDGF simultaneously, a sandwich assay was developed. Briefly, Nunc Maxisorp\u00ae plates were coated with either human PDGF-BB or human VEGF-121 (20 ng/mL). After \n\n blocking the wells with a 1% BSA solution, PDGF/VEGF aptamer construct was added (10 nM) and allowed to bind to the adsorbed protein target. After washing, the biotinylated complementary protein (2 nM PDGF-BB for VEGF- 121 coated plates and 2 nM VEGF- 121 or VEGF-165 for PDGF-BB coated plates) was allowed to bind to form a ternary complex. Following another wash, horseradish peroxidase conjugated streptavidin (HRP-SA) was added and allowed to form a quaternary complex. After a final wash, a color forming horse radish peroxidase substrate was added according to the manufacturer's directions (Thermo Scientific TMB substrate kit 34021) and the reaction stopped when appropriate by addition of 1.6 M H<sub>2</sub>S0<sub>4</sub>. The absorbance per well at 450 nm was determined with the Spectramax M5 plate reader with auto check on. In parallel to the method described above, a set of four control experiments were executed in which one of the 4 components that m"
