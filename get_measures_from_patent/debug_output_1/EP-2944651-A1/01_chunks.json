    "ression of CTLA4 was observed in all other tissues analyzed, including liver, heart, kidney, skeletal muscle, brain, spinal cord, prostate, and pancreas. CTLA4 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is a costimulatory molecule expressed by activated T cells. CTLA4 is similar to the T-cell costimulatory CD28, and both molecules bind to B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86) on antigen-presenting cells. CTLA4 transmits an inhibitory signal to T cells, whereas CD28 transmits a stimulatory signal. CTLA4 contains a leader sequence, a V domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail encoded by 4 exons, respectively. The cytoplasmic tail contains 2 potential phosphorylation sites. Northern blot analysis detected 2 CTLA4 mRNA transcripts of 1.8 and 0.8 kb in activated peripheral blood T cells. Linsley et al. (Linsley et al., J. Biol. Chem.; 270: 15417-15424 (1995)) demonstrated that the CTLA4 protein is a homodimer interconnected by a disulfide bond in the extracellular domain at cysteine residue 120. Each monomeric polypeptide contains a high affinity binding site for the costimulatory molecules B7-1 and B7-2. Using RT-PCR, Magistrelli et al. (Magistrelli et al., Eur. J. Immunol.; 29: 3596-3602 (1999)) found that nonactivated human peripheral blood T lymphocytes expressed an alternatively spliced form of CTLA4. The splicing induces deletion of the transmembrane region encoded by exon 2, resulting in the production of a soluble form of the protein with a molecular mass of 23 kD; membrane CTLA4 has an apparent molecular mass of 45 kD, suggesting that the soluble form is a monomeric protein. Functional studies showed that the soluble form of CTLA4 is downregulated by T-cell activation, in contrast to membrane CTLA4, which is upregulated by T-cell activation. CTLA4 binds to the B7 isoforms with an affinity that is 10 to 100 times that of CD28. Ostrov et al. (Ostrov et al., Science; 290: 816-819 (2000)) determined the crystal structure of the extracellular portion of murine Ctla4 at 2.0-angstrom resolution. Consistent with its membership in the Ig superfamily, Ctla4 displays a strand topology similar to V-alpha domains. Ctla4 has an unusual dimerization mode that places the B7 binding sites distal to the dimerization interface, allowing each Ctla4 dimer to bind 2 divalent B7 molecules. The authors suggested that periodic rearrangement of these components might explain the role of CTLA4 in the regulation of T-cell responsiveness. Oaks et al. (Oaks et al., Cell. Immunol.; 201: 144-153 (2000)) found that activation of human lymphocytes resulted in the disappearance of sCTLA4 at 48 hours followed by its gradual reappearance, whereas CTLA4-TM rapidly increased and remained present at the same level after activation. CTLA4Ig is a soluble chimeric protein consisting of the extracellular domain of human CTLA4 and a fragment of the Fc portion of human IgG1. It binds to B7-1 and to B7-2 molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and thereby blocks the CD28-mediated costimulatory signal for T-cell activation. Fall",
    " Flotillins are integral membrane proteins that have been shown to be present in several subcellular components, including caveolae (invaginated plasma membrane microdomains), lipid rafts (sphingolipid and cholesterol-rich, detergent-resistant plasma membrane microdomains), and the Golgi apparatus. The molecular function of flotillins remains uncertain. They are probably involved in organising the structure of caveolae and lipid rafts, and other detergent resistant membrane domains. They may also be involved in signal transduction. Flotillins have been shown to accumulate in brain cells with the development of Alzheimer's pathology. Also included in this family are Reggie proteins, which are expressed in non-caveolar neuronal plasma membrane domains. Transmembrane domain prediction with the online transmembrane domain prediction server \"DAS\" located at http://www.sbc.su.se/%7Emiklos/DAS/ identified no potential transmembrane regions. FLOT1 has very high homology (&gt; 98%) to the FLOT1 protein sequences described for mouse and rat. Zhang et al. (Zhang et al., Genome Res.; 10: 1546-1560 (2000)) purified human FLOT1 by RT-PCR from CD34+ cord blood and adult bone marrow. By analyzing microarrays, they found weak expression of FLOT1 in 4 of 5 hematopoietic cell lines and no expression in a promyelocytic cell line. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues revealed expression in adipose tissue, heart, skeletal muscle, and lung. By Western blot analysis, Flot1 was also found as a 47-kD protein in caveolin-rich membrane domains isolated from human lung and from cultured mouse adipocytes.</p>Suitable MHC ligands/fragments of human FLOT1 can be identified by the method described in connection with the Cologne 1 above.</p>FOXP3: Human FOXP3 (forkhead box P3), also known as IPEX or scurfin, is located in the 48993841-49008232 genomic region on chromosome X in the Xp11.23 region. The full length transcript consists of 12 exons resulting after transcription in an mRNA which has 6659 base pairs. The actual coding sequence itself consists of 1830 base pairs. The translation of this sequence results in a putative protein with a length of 609 amino acids.</p>Chatila et al. (Chatila et al., J. Clin. Invest.; 106: R75-81 (2000)) stated that the human FOXP3 open reading frame of 1,146 bp encodes a deduced 381-amino acid protein. By PCR of a human peripheral blood mononuclear cell cDNA library, Smith et al. (Smith et al., Immunology; 119: 203-211 (2006)) cloned full-length FOXP3 and splice variants lacking exon 2 and both exons 2 and 7. The full-length protein contains 431 amino acids. The variant lacking exon 2 encodes a 396-amino acid protein lacking part of the proline-rich domain, and the variant lacking exons 2 and 7 encodes a 369-amino acid protein that also lacks a large part of the putative leucine zipper. Smith et al. (Smith et al., Immunology; 119: 203-211 (2006)) noted that mice appear to lack Foxp3 variants. FOXP3 was screened for functional domains and has",

The first transcript consisting of 14 exons resulting after transcription in an mRNA which has 2396 base pairs (see SEQ ID NO:51). The second transcript consists of 14 exons resulting after transcription in an mRNA which has 2268 base pairs (see SEQ ID NO:53). The actual coding sequence of both transcripts consists of 1452 base pairs. The translation of this sequence results in a putative protein with a length of 483 amino acids (SEQ ID NO:54).</p>ICA1 is found both in the cytosol and as membrane-bound form on the Golgi complex and immature secretory granules. This protein is believed to be an autoantigen in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and primary Sjogren's syndrome.</p>ICA1 was screened for functional domains and has an Arfaptin domain in the 22-249 region. Arfaptin is a ubiquitously expressed protein implicated in mediating cross-talk between Rac, a member of the Rho family, and Arf small GTPases; Arfaptin binds to GTP-bound Arf1 and Arf6, but binds Rac.GTP and Rac.GDP with similar affinities. Structures of Arfaptin with Rac bound to either GDP or the slowly hydrolysable analogue GMPPNP show that the switch regions adopt similar conformations in both complexes. Arf1 and Arf6 are thought to bind to the same surface as Rac. ICA1 additionally has a Islet cell autoantigen ICA69 (ICA69) domain in the 261-483 region. This family includes a 69 kD protein which has been identified as an islet cell autoantigen in type I diabetes mellitus. Its precise function is unknown. Transmembrane domain prediction with the online transmembrane domain prediction server \"DAS\" located at http://www.sbc.su.se/%7Emiklos/DAS/ identified no potential transmembrane regions. ICA1 has high homology (&gt; 89%) to the protein sequences of ICA1 described for mouse and rat. ICA1 is expressed in salivary and lacrimal glands. In NOD mice, in which loss of salivary secretory function develops spontaneously (as in human Sjogren syndrome), Winer et al. (Winer et al., Lancet; 360: 1063-1069 (2002)) found that disruption of the Ica1 gene prevented lacrimal gland disease and greatly reduced salivary gland disease. These animals developed type 1 diabetes with slight delay but at much the same incidence as wildtype animals, assigning a facultative rather than obligate role to ICA1 in the development of diabetes.</p>Suitable MHC ligands/fragments of human ICA1 can be identified by the method described in connection with the Cologne 1 above.</p>IL10RA: Human IL10RA (interleukin 10 receptor, alpha 1) is located in the 117362319-117377404 genomic region on chromosome 11 in the 11q23 region. It consists of 7 exons resulting after transcription in an mRNA which has 3649 base pairs (see SEQ ID NO:57). The actual coding sequence itself consists of 1737 base pairs. The translation of this sequence results in a putative protein with a length of 578 amino acids (",
    "ptors). To span the hydrocarbon core of the membrane of \u223c3 nm requires an alpha helix of \u223c20 uncharged predominantly apolar residues. Membrane separates two aqueous compartments by a thin two dimensional lipid phase. Membrane proteins generally span this lipid phase and therefore needed to accomodate to the hydrophilic stretch on both sides of the membrane as well as to the hydrophobic environment in the core of the bilayer. The structure of the membrane embedded portions consist of either of transmembrane alpha helices often assembled in to helix bundles or of antiparralel beta sheets forming barrel shaped pores. The length of the transmembrane helix may even correlate with the thickness of its membrane. Single spanning membrane proteins of the Endoplasmic reticulum(ER) and Golgi generally have shorter transmembrane domains than plasma membrane proteins. Since cholestrol content and thus the thickness of the lipid bilayer also increases along with the secretory pathway, this might reflect a role of the transmembrane segments and proteins in lipid sorting. In multi spanning membrane proteins the transmembrane helices are tightly bundled to compact, globular structure from which lipids are excluded. The protein has high homology (&gt; 69%) to the protein sequences of SELP described for mouse and rat. This protein is located mainly in the plasma membrane. Expression analysis in different tissues demonstrated medium level expression in almost all tissues analyzed. SELP is a 140-kD adhesion molecule, expressed at the surface of activated cells, that mediates the interaction of activated endothelial cells or platelets with leukocytes. SELP was detected in megakaryocytes and platelets, as well as in vascular endothelial cells, but was not found in a variety of other cell types examined. In endothelial cells, the protein was localized to the membranes of Weibel-Palade bodies, the intracellular storage granules for von Willebrand factor. CD24 is a ligand for P-selectin. Florian et al. (Florian et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.; 281: 1045-1050 (2001)) demonstrated that sorting nexin-17 (SNX17) interacts with the cytosolic domain of P-selectin and suggested that SNX17 may function in the intracellular trafficking of P-selectin. Mayadas et al. (Mayadas et al., Cell; 74: 541-554 (1993)) generated P-selectin-deficient mice by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells and found that they exhibited a number of defects in leukocyte behavior, including elevated numbers of circulating neutrophils, virtually total absence of leukocyte rolling in mesenteric venules, and delayed recruitment of neutrophils to the peritoneal cavity upon experimentally induced inflammation.</p>Suitable MHC ligands/fragments of human SELP can be identified by the method described in connection with the Cologne 1 above.</p>SEMA3G: Human SEMA3G (sema domain, immunoglobulin domain (Ig), short basic domain, secreted, (semaphorin) 3G) is located in the 52454082-52442307 genomic region on ch",

The putative protein has high homology (&gt; 87%) to the putative protein sequences of STOM described for mouse and rat. STOM is a 29,000-kD integral membrane protein that is exposed on the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane and is susceptible to phosphorylation by a cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The same protein can be demonstrated in human cell lines of epithelial and lymphoid origin, notably in HeLa cells. Structural analysis assigned STOM to the type Ib transmembrane proteins. STOM has a wide pattern of expression, with high levels of mRNA in heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and testis but low levels in lung, brain, and spleen. Models of the predicted protein structure showed a short NH2-terminal head, a strongly hydrophobic 28-amino acid stretch presumably encoding a single membrane-spanning domain, and a large domain composed of beta sheet and alpha helix. Suitable MHC ligands/fragments of the human STOM proteins can be identified by the method described in connection with the Cologne 1 above.</p>TCF7: Human TCF7 (transcription factor 7 (T-cell specific, HMG-box)), is located in the 133478300-133511818 genomic region on chromosome 5 in the 5q31.1 region. TCF 7 isoform 1 consists of 9 exons resulting after transcription in an mRNA which has 3283 base pairs (see SEQ ID NO:107). The actual coding sequence itself consists of 1155 base pairs. The translation of this sequence results in a putative protein with a length of 384 amino acids (SEQ ID NO:108).
