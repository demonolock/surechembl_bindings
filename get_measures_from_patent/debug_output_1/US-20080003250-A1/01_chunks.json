    "e drug five times a day for five days (Tyring et al., 2002). </p> Compared to treating acute symptoms, complete suppression of any recurrent outbreak is advantageous because it reduces the pain and stress the patient may incur. Preventing lesions from forming also reduces the risk of acquiring another infection, such as HIV, through the broken skin that may occur as the result of recrudescent infection (Hook et al., 1992; Wald and Link, 2002). Towards that goal, ACV has been proved to be capable of not only treating acute HSV-1 infections, but also suppressing reactivation of the virus when taken prophylactically over the long term (Lietman, 1982; Saral et al., 1981). </p> ACV enters HSV-1-infected cells and is phosphorylated by the viral enzyme thymidine kcinase (Nash et al.) to ACV monophosphate (Furman et al., 1984; Fyfe et al., 1978), which is subsequently modified by cellular kinases to its active form, ACV triphosphate (Miller and Miller, 1982). The HSV-1 DNA polymerase mistakenly incorporates the ACV triphosphate into the growing DNA chain, resulting in premature termination of viral replication due to the lack of a free 3\u2032 hydroxyl group on the drug. ACV is very effective at disrupting viral DNA synthesis without halting host cell DNA synthesis because the viral TK is capable of phosphorylating ACV, whereas the cellular orthologue is not (Furman et al., 1984; Fyfe et al., 1978). Furthermore, the viral DNA polymerase has a higher affinity for ACV-triphosphate (average Ki=3.5 mM), relative to the drug's affinity for host eukaryotic DNA polymerase (Ki=0.96\u00b10.08 uM), providing an even greater effect of the drug in HSV-1-infected cells, while providing an extra margin of safety in normal host cells (Furman et al., 1979; Furman et al., 1984; Martin et al., 1994). </p> Despite the efficacy of ACV in the treatment of HSV-1, patient compliance and bioavailability are still major issues and, therefore, maintenance of the requisite levels of drug in the patient is a potential problem. It is estimated that the amount of ACV delivered to the bloodstream for humans is only 10-20% of the oral dose taken, with nearly 80% of the consumed ACV removed due to renal clearance (de Miranda and Blum, 1983; Laskin et al., 1982). Because high levels of unutilized drug are excreted unaltered before having a chance to provide antiviral protection (Lasluin et al., 1982; Lietman, 1982), the dose, dosing frequency, and cost of treatment all rise. </p> Several attempts have been made to increase the bioavailability of ACV, such as the production of valacyclovir, an ACV ester with 1-valine (Tyring et al., 2002; Weller et al., 1993). This prodrug of ACV has increased bioavailability, to about 50% of the oral dose consumed (Tyring et al., 2002; Weller et al., 1993); however, daily dosing is still required. In addition to the esterification of ACV with a valine, Tolle-Sanders and colleagues attempted to increase the oral bioavailability of ACV using ACV linked to chenodeoxycholate via a valine, to form ACV-valylchenodeoxycholate, which is cleaved by a "
