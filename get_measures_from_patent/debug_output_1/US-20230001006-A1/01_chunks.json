    " AMHRII expression score (or E-SCORE) is determined by immunohistological methods as shown in the examples herein. According to these preferred embodiments, AMHRII membrane expression is assessed by using a detectable antibody specific for AMHRII and by (i) determining the frequency of cells having the said anti-AMHRII antibody bound thereto and (ii) determining the intensity of the signal generated by the said detectable anti-AMHRII antibody after its binding to the membrane-expressed AMHRII.</p>Although, AMHRII-expressing cancer cells having an AMHRII expression score of 1.5 or more have been determined for various cancers, albeit to distinct frequencies. Illustratively, it has been shown that cancer cells derived from colon tumors are classified as AMHRII positive (i.e. having an AMHRII score of 1.5 or more) with a higher frequency than cancer cells derived from head and neck cancer.</p>For determining the level of AMHRII membrane expression, detection of AMHRII at the cell membrane shall be most preferably performed by using an anti-AMHRII monoclonal antibody having a high affinity and high specificity for AMHRII.</p>Further, determination of AMHRII expression by an immuno-histochemical method with the view of determining a AMHRII score most preferably involves a careful pretreatment of the tissue sample before contacting the said sample with an appropriate detection reagent (e.g. a high affinity anti-AMHRII monoclonal antibody such as monoclonal 3C23K antibody, having a Kd value of 55.3 pM for binding to AMHRII). Sample pretreatment shall allow increasing the availability to the detection reagent of the AMHRII molecules expressed at the cell surface. Illustratively, staining method comprises an appropriate combination of specific steps such as (i) a high-temperature dewaxing by exposure to a microwave source and (ii) a system for amplifying the signal generated by the binding of an AMHRII-binding reagent, such as a biotinylated anti-AMHRII antibody that may be subsequently complexed with a streptavidin-conjugated detectable reagent. A pretreatment dewaxing step has appeared to be important for reversing the detection signal extinction effect due to the prior tissue fixation step. The inventors have shown that AMHRII detectability is particularly sensitive to the action of formalin which is used for the tissue fixation step.</p>In the context of the present invention, this means that an ADC of the invention will be a useful therapeutic agent with a higher frequency for treating patients affected with a colon cancer than for treating patients affected with a head and neck cancer. This also means that, although an ADC of the invention may be a relevant therapeutic agent for treating patients affected with head and neck cancer, it will be preferred to test previously for the AMHRII expression of the tumor-derived cancer cells for deciding that a specific patient will be administered with an ADC of the invention.</p>As used herein, the interchang"
