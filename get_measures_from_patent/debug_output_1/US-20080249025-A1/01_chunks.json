    "/p>GST-Rb\u2014An E. coli expression construct containing the hyperphosphorylation domain of pRb (amino acids 773-924) was purified on a glutathione-Sepharose column according to the manufacturers instructions (Pharmacia)</p>Peptide Precipitation of Cdk4 and Cyclin D1</p>A 20 amino acid peptide library, that spanned the entire sequence of p21<sup>WAF1 </sup>(FIG. 1), was screened for Cdk4/cyclin D1 interacting peptides. Peptide (1.5 \u03bcg) was diluted in 100 \u03bcl of PBS and incubated with 10 \u03bcl of packed streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. Unbound peptide was removed by extensive washing with PBS and the beads, plus bound peptide, were incubated for 1 h at 4\u00b0 C. with reticulocyte lysate containing either Cdk4 or cyclin D1 labelled with [<sup>35 </sup>S] methionine. The beads were washed three times with 1.25\u00d7 PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and boiled in the presence of 0.125 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8 containing: 4% (w/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol and 200 mM DTT. The bound protein was analysed by SBS-PAGE followed by auto-radiography and quantification of the <sup>35</sup>S-labelled protein using a Bio-Imager and Whole Band Analysis Software (Millipore).</p>Enzyme Assays</p>Phosphorylation of GST-Rb\u2014Cdk4 activity was measured using the cyclin D1-Cdk4 containing insect cell lysate described above Extract (1 \u03bcl) was added to a final reaction volume of 10 \u03bcl, containing: 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM \u03b2-glycerophosphate, 1 mM NaF, 10 mM PKI, 50 \u03bcM ATP containing [<sup>32</sup>P] ATP (1000 cpm/pMol) and 0.5 \u03bcg GST-Rb. The assays were started by the addition of the GST-Rb substrate, incubated at 30\u00b0 C. for 10 min (the incorporation of <sup>32</sup>P into GST-Rb was linear over 15-20 min) and terminated by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heating at 95\u00b0 C. for 4 min The samples were analysed by SDS-PAGE on 12% gels followed by auto-radiography and quantification using a Bio-Imager.</p>Peptide Phosphorylation</p>The biotinylated peptides (1 \u03bcg) were incubated for 30 min at 30\u00b0 C. in a final volume of 20 \u03bcl containing: 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.5 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM \u03b2-glycerophosphate, 1 mM NaF, 10 mM PKI, 50 \u03bcM ATP containing [<sup>32</sup>P]ATP (6000 cpm/pMol) and either 1 \u03bcl of cyclin D1-Cdk4 insect cell lysate, 1 \u03bcl of uninfected insect cell lysate or 0.02 mU of protein kinase C plus 0.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 mg/ml phosphatidyl serine and 20 mg/ml diacylglycerol. The reactions were stopped by heating at 60\u00b0 C. for 5 min and streptavidin agarose beads were added (10 \u03bcl packed cell volume washed with 3\u00d7 PBS) and incubated with shaking at 4\u00b0 C. for 30 min. The beads were washed extensively with PBS containing 3% (v/v) Tween-20 and the incorporation of radioactivity into the peptides was determined by Cerenkov counting.</p>Cell Cycle Measurements</p>Carrier linked peptides were designed for delivery into proliferating HaCaT cells (see FIG. 9). Cells were seeded on 30 mm culture plates and grown to 50% confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) foetal calf serum (FCS). Peptides were added to the medium and the cells were incubated for 24 hours During the last 30 minutes of the incubation the cells were pulse labelled in the presence of 15 \u03bcM BrdU. The cells were trypsinised, fixed in absolute alcohol and prepared for FACS analysis using a single laser flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, FACScan) as previously described (Renzing et al, 1996).</p>pRb Phosphorylation in HaCaT Cells</p>HaCaT cells were seeded on 30 mm culture plates at 25% confluency in DMEM with 10% FCS. The FCS was withdrawn after 24 hours and the cells were starved for 72 hours. At the end of this period the medium was supplemented with 10% FCS and carrier linked peptides Samples were taken over a 24 hour time course and the cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 150 mM NaCl, 1.0% (v/v) NP-40, 0.5% (w/v) DOC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1 mM PMSF, 0.1 mg/ml aprotinin and 0.5 mg/ml leupeptin) for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. The phosphorylation statues of pRb was determined by Western blot analysis, as previously described (Fahraeus et al, 1996) except that the blot was probed with a pRb polyclonal antibody (C-15, Santa Cruz).</p>Results</p>Peptide-Binding Assay for Cyclin D1 and Cdk4</p>Using a series of synthetic peptides that span the entire sequence of p21<sup>WAF1 </sup>(FIG. 1), we determined whether these peptides could mimic full length p21<sup>WAF1 </sup>protein by forming a stable complex with either cyclin D1 or Cdk4. If peptide-binding mimetics of p21<sup>WAF1 </sup>protein could be identified, then this would assist in identifying the minimal binding motif of p21<sup>WAF1 </sup>protein required for cyclin D1-Cdk4 holoenzyme inhibition and whether p21<sup>WAF1 </sup>was targeting the cyclin or the kinase subunit This would also define a system for using small peptides to study p21<sup>WAF1 </sup>protein reaction mechanism and to design mimetic drugs.</p>The peptide-binding assay involved quantifying the amount of <sup>35</sup>S-labelled cyclin D1 or Cdk4 which bound specifically to biotinylated peptides that were captured on streptavidin coated agarose beads. The peptide-coated beads were added to extracts containing either <sup>35</sup>S-labelled cyclin D1 or Cdk4 translated in vitro, the beads were washed extensively to remove unbound protein, and the bound cyclin D1 or Cdk4 was quantified by SDS-PAGE followed by auto-radiography and bio-imaging. This is referred to below as a peptide precipitation assay and has been used previously to demonstrate evolutionary conservation of p21<sup>WAF1 </sup>binding to PCNA (Ball and Lane, 1996).</p>A Small Peptide Derived from Amino Acids 46-65 in the N-Terminal Domain of p21<sup>WAF1 </sup>Binds Directly to Cdk4</p>Using the peptide-precipitation assay, peptide 4 (from the N-terminal domain of p21<sup>WAF1</sup>) bound specifically to Cdk4, but not to cyclin D1 (FIG. 1). This interaction is physiologically important, since the CDK interacting domain of the p21<sup>WAF1 </sup>protein has previously been proposed to localise to the N-terminal domain of the molecule (Chen et al., 1995; Harper et al., 1995; Luo et al., 1995). More specifically, deletions (Nakanishi et al., 1995a) or mutations (Goubin and Ducommun, 1995) in the region of amino acids 45-71 compromise the ability of full length p21WAF1 to interact with Cdk2. Whether this loss of p21WAF1 binding function is due to, (i) mutation/deletion ",
    "both peptide 10 and peptide 11 are good inhibitors of cyclin D1-Cdk4 activity (FIG. 2) as they both contain the inhibitory motif. Thus, it appears that the inhibitory portion of peptide 10 does not overlap with the PCNA binding site as they have no amino acid residues in common.</p>A Single Amino Acid Substitution in Peptide 10 Makes it a More Potent Inhibitor thus Approaching the Specific Activity of Full Length p21<sup>WAF1 </sup>Protein</p>Whilst carrying out the alanine scan experiments we noticed that one of the mutant peptides (D-A at position 9 of peptide 10 or 149 of the full length protein; FIG. 6) appeared to make the peptide a better inhibitor of cyclin D1-Cdk4 activity. We determined the I<sub>0.5 </sub>for this peptide and compared it with peptide 10, full length purified his-p21<sup>WAF1</sup>, and a peptide derived from the tumour suppressor protein p16 INK4 which has recently been reported to inhibit cyclin D1-Cdk4 activity in vitro and to prevent cell cycle progression (Fahraeus et al, 1996). The D-A mutation decreases the I<sub>0.5 </sub>from 100 nM to 46 nM (FIG. 7). Comparing this with the p16INK4-based peptide, which has an I<sub>0.5 </sub>of 16.3 \u03bcM (FIG. 7), we have now produced a peptide which is approximately 350-fold more active as a Cdk4 inhibitory compound. In fact, we now begin to approach the potency of p21<sup>WAF1 </sup>itself, which has an I<sub>0.5 </sub>of 11 nM in the insect cell lysate assay (FIG. 7) This value is in the same range as the Ki of 40 nM for p21<sup>WAF1 </sup>obtained for the inhibition of cyclin D1-Cdk4 in Sf9 cell lysates by Harper et al. (1995). Compared to full length protein, the mutant peptide 10 has only a 3.5-fold lower specific activity as a kinase inhibitor in crude lysates. Why mutating the D-A in this position, which is well out side the domain shown to be essential for activity, reduces the I<sub>0.5 </sub>is not known. It seems likely that it involves the presentation of the inhibitory motif, rather than a direct role for this residue in inhibition, as this mutation does not appear to increase the affinity of the peptide for either Cdk4 or cyclin D1 (data not shown).</p>The results indicate that peptide 10 could be used as a model on which to base small peptide mimetics of p21<sup>WAF1 </sup>and we have provided evidence that alterations in the peptides structure or presentation of the active residues may lead to the generation of a peptide inhibitor which approaches the potency of full length p21<sup>WAF1 </sup>as a cyclin D-Cdk4 inhibitor.</p>Results for the C-Terminal Peptide (Peptide 10)</p>An Eight Amino Acid Peptide is Sufficient to Inhibit Cyclin D-Cdk4 Activity</p>Having identified residues which appeared to be critical for the inhibition of cyclin D1-Cdk4 by peptide 10, we determined if these residues were sufficient for inhibition, or if they had to be presented within the context of a larger peptide. Strikingly, the eight amino acid peptide, KRRLIFSK, retained the ability"
