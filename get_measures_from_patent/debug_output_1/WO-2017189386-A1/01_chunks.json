    "conversion of N-formylkynurenine produced by TDO or IDO activity to kynurenine which was then quantified by fluorescence following addition of Erhlich's Reagent. The protocols for these are set out below. \n\n A172 and SKOV3 cell based assays for detection of kynurenine produced by TDO and/or IPO</p>A172 (human glioblastoma) and SKOV3 (human ovarian adenocarcinoma) cells were seeded in a 96 well plate at 30,000 or 40,000 cells per well respectively in phenol red-free RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine and 500 \u03bc\u039c L-tryptophan. IDO expression was induced in the SKOV3 cells by the addition of 500 ng/ml IFN-\u03b3. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with or without the addition of test compound. After 48 hours, the cells were removed by centrifugation and Erhlich's reagent was added to the supernatant. The Erhlich's reagent was incubated for 5 minutes before the absorbance was read at 490 nM. </p>TDO and IDO biochemical coupled assay </p> Recombinant human IDO or TDO was incubated in 50 mM KP04 (pH 7.0), 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.05 % Triton\u2122 XI 00, 20 mM ascorbate, 10 \u03bc\u039c methylene blue, 500 U/ml catalase, 50 \u03bcg/ml KynB (kynurenine formamidase). TDO assays were carried out in the presence of 330 \u03bc\u039c L-tryptophan, while IDO assays had the addition of 45 \u03bc\u039c </p> L-tryptophan. After incubation for 17 minutes at room temperature the reactions were stopped by the addition of Erhlich's reagent and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes before the fluorescence was read. </p> The pIC50 values for a variety of test compounds are shown in the following table. </p><img id=\"imgf000057_0001\" path=\"imgf000057_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/410592582/WO/20171102/A1/002017/18/93/86/imgf000057_0001.tif\"/>\n 10 5.11 &lt;5 6.2 5.57 </p> 11 5.43 5.68 6.99 6.33 </p> 12 5.93 6.18 5.74 6.1 </p> 13 5.9 &lt;5 6.53 5.77 </p> 14 5.33 &lt;5 5.92 4.78 </p> 15 5.25 &lt;5 5.66 4.42 </p> 16 6.87 5.1 7.06 5.92 </p>In addition to the above assays, the activities of certain exemplary compounds were determined using the following IDOl enzyme and IDOl cellular assays. IDOl Enzyme Assay </p> Compounds to be tested were serially diluted in ten 3-fold steps in DMSO starting from 10 mM DMSO stocks. Compound dilutions or DMSO alone were then dispensed from the dilution plate into a Greiner black 384-well assay plate (catalog #781086) using an Echo 555 acoustic liquid handler (Labcyte). </p> HIS-tagged IDOl protein was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli using</p>ZYP5052 autoinduction media supplemented with 500 \u03bc\u039c delta aminolevulinic acid for 48 hours at 16 degrees Celcius. IDOl protein was purified using Ni<sup>2+</sup>-affinity resin and size exclusion chromatography. Purified protein was then diluted in assay buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.0, 1% glycerol, 20 \u03bc\u039c methylene blue, 0.05% Tween-20, 20 mM sodium ascorbate, 100 units/mL catalase to obtain a final IDOl concentration of 40 nM. IDOl solution (30 \u03bc\u039c) or buffer alone (30 \u03bc\u039c) were dispensed to wells of the assay plate using a BioRAPTR liquid dispenser (Beckman Coulter). Assay plates containing compound and IDOl enzyme were incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. Afterwards, 10 \u03bc\u03af of 400 \u03bc\u039c tryptophan in assay buffer were added to each well of the assay plate using a BioRAPTR liquid dispenser. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes and reactions were quenched by addition of 10 \u03bc\u03af of 0.5 M methyl isonipecotate in dimethyl sulfoxide. Plates were sealed and incubated at 37 degrees Celcius for 4 hours or 50 degrees Celcius for 2 hours. The plates are allowed to cool and then centrifuged for 1 minute at lOOOxg. The resulting fluoresence was measured in an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer) with a 400/25 nm excitation filter and an 510/20 nm emission filter. \n\n The fluoresence intensity of each well was corrected for the background observed in wells that did not receive IDOl and was expressed as a fraction of the intensity observed in wells that received IDOl enzyme and DMSO only. Potencies were calculated by linear least squares fit to the four parameter logistic IC50 equation. </p>IDOl HEK293 Cellular Assay </p> Compounds to be tested were serially diluted in ten 3-fold steps in DMSO starting from 10 mM DMSO stocks. Compound dilutions or DMSO alone were then dispensed from the dilution plate into a Greiner black 384-well assay plate (catalog #781086) using an Echo 550 acoustic liquid handler (Labcyte). </p> HEK293 cell pellets were resuspended to 5 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL in complete HEK293 culture media (89% DMEM, 10% FBS, 1% penicilllin/streptomycin). Suspended cells (2 mL) were dispensed into each well of a 6-well Corning plate (Catalog# 3516). Cells were allowed to attach and were incubated for 20 hours at 37 degrees Celcius in a 5% CO2 incubator. Flag-IDOl vector (Genscript True ORF Gold, 2 ug) in 150 uL of Opti-MEM medium was added to to each well of a Coming 24 well plate (Cat# 3527) and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. To each well of the 24-well plate was added 150 Lipofectamine 2000 (Gibco) and the plate incubated at room temperature for 20-30 minutes. To each well of attched cells in the 6-well plate, 250 of the transfection mix from the 24-well plate was gently added to each well and IDOl protein was allowed to express for 24-30 hours at 37 degrees Celcius in a 5% CO2 incubator. </p> Media was removed from the cells which were then washed with 2 mL </p>Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS). After removal of DPBS, 0.5 mL of TrypLE (Gibco) was added and incubated at 5 minutes until cells lift from the su",
    " and pooled into a conical tube. Cells were pelleted at 200xg for 5 minutes and resuspended in an equal volume of complete DMEM medium. Cells were diluted to 4x10<sup>5</sup> cells per mL in complete HEK293 media. L-Tryptophan was added to added to give a final concentraiton of 200 \u03bc\u039c. The diluted transfected cells (50 \u03bc\u03af) or nontransfected cells (50 \u03bc\u03af) were dispensed into wells of Greiner black 384-well assay plates (catalog #781086) containing previously diluted compounds. The plate is briefly mixed and centrifuged at 200xg for 10 seconds to collect cells at the bottom of the plate. Plates were covered and incubated for 20-24 hours at 37 degrees C in \n\n a 5% CO2 incubator. Afterwards 10 of 0.5 M methyl isonipecotate in dimethyl sulfoxide was added to each well, mixed, sealed, and centrifuged at 500 rpm for 10 seconds. Plates were incubated at 37 degrees in a 5% CO2 incubator overnight to develop fluoresence. The plates are allowed to cool and then centrifuged for 1 minute at lOOOxg. The resulting fluoresence was measured in an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer) with a 400/25 nm excitation filter and an 510/20 nm emission filter. </p> The fluoresence intensity of each well was corrected for the background observed in wells with untransfected cells and was expressed as a fraction of the intensity observed in wells of IDOl transfected cells and DMSO only.
