{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences/rows that meet the criteria:\n\n\nA172 (human glioblastoma) and SKOV3 (human ovarian adenocarcinoma) cells were seeded in a 96 well plate at 30,000 or 40,000 cells per well respectively in phenol red-free RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine and 500 \u03bc\u039c L-tryptophan.\nRecombinant human IDO or TDO was incubated in 50 mM KP04 (pH 7.0), 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.05 % Triton\u2122 XI 00, 20 mM ascorbate, 10 \u03bc\u039c methylene blue, 500 U/ml catalase, 50 \u03bcg/ml KynB (kynurenine formamidase).\nTDO assays were carried out in the presence of 330 \u03bc\u039c L-tryptophan, while IDO assays had the addition of 45 \u03bc\u039c L-tryptophan.\nPurified protein was then diluted in assay buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.0, 1% glycerol, 20 \u03bc\u039c methylene blue, 0.05% Tween-20, 20 mM sodium ascorbate, 100 units/mL catalase to obtain a final IDOl concentration of 40 nM.\nIDOl solution (30 \u03bc\u039c) or buffer alone (30 \u03bc\u039c) were dispensed to wells of the assay plate using a BioRAPTR liquid dispenser (Beckman Coulter).\n10 \u03bc\u03af of 400 \u03bc\u039c tryptophan in assay buffer were added to each well of the assay plate using a BioRAPTR liquid dispenser.\nThe plates are allowed to cool and then centrifuged for 1 minute at lOOOxg.\nThe resulting fluoresence was measured in an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer) with a 400/25 nm excitation filter and an 510/20 nm emission filter.\nPotencies were calculated by linear least squares fit to the four parameter logistic IC50 equation.\nHEK293 cell pellets were resuspended to 5 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL in complete HEK293 culture media (89% DMEM, 10% FBS, 1% penicilllin/streptomycin).\nFlag-IDOl vector (Genscript True ORF Gold, 2 ug) in 150 uL of Opti-MEM medium was added to to each well of a Coming 24 well plate (Cat# 3527) and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature.\nTo each well of the 24-well plate was added 150 Lipofectamine 2000 (Gibco) and the plate incubated at room temperature for 20-30 minutes.\nMedia was removed from the cells which were then washed with 2 mL Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS).\nAfter removal of DPBS, 0.5 mL of TrypLE (Gibco) was added and incubated at 5 minutes until cells lift from the surface.\n\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, I realize that most of these sentences do not contain all four required components. Here is the revised list of extracted sentences/rows that meet the criteria:\n\n\nNone of the sentences contain all four required components: a specific molecule name, ID or other identifier, a bioactivity metric, a specific numeric value for that metric, and a unit for that value.\n\n\nHowever, I can suggest some sentences that contain some of the required components:\n\n\nThe pIC50 values for a variety of test compounds are shown in the following table.\nPurified protein was then diluted in assay buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.0, 1% glycerol, 20 \u03bc\u039c methylene blue, 0.05% Tween-20, 20 mM sodium ascorbate, 100 units/mL catalase to obtain a final IDOl concentration of 40 nM.\nPotencies were calculated by linear least squares fit to the four parameter logistic IC50 equation.\n\n\nThese sentences contain some of the required components, but not all of them. If you would like, I can try to help you further or provide more context."}
