    "dimethylformamide (10 mL) was coupled with MPA-(AEES)<sub>2</sub>-CO2PNP as from Example VI (200 mg) in the presence of NMM (200 uL) at ambient temperature for 16 h. N,N-dimethylformamide was removed under vacuum and the residue treated with TFA for 10 min. After TFA was removed in vacuo, the residue was dissolved in in water and injected into HPLC using a 27-32% gradient over 120 min. The pure fractions were combined and the solvent lyophilized to give ( Lys B29)-MPA(AEES)<sub>2</sub>-Insulin as a white powder (56.3 mg, 25.9%).

The solvent was removed under vacuum and the residue treated with TFA for 10 min. After TFA was removed in vacuo, the residue was dissolved in in water and injected into HPLC using a 27-36% gradient over 120 min. The pure fractions were combined and the solvent lyophilized to give ( Lys B29)-MPA(OA)-Insulin as a white powder (64.2 mg, 31%).

The membranes were filtered and washed 3 times and the filters were counted to determine [125I] insulin specifically bound. IC50 were calculated using GraphPad Prism software.</p>The results of IC50 are illustrated in Table 2.\nTable 2IC50 (nM)Insulin12.0Example I57.1Example II18.8Example III17.2Example IV46.0Example VI24.9Example VII58.1Example VIII64.1Conjugate of Example I2059.0Conjugate of Example II100.5Conjugate of Example III87.7Conjugate of Example IV1190.0Conjugate of Example VI38.5Conjugate of Example VII508.2Conjugate of Example VIII1013.4</p>Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 illustrates the insulin binding in rat liver membrane in terms of the % of inhibition in function of the concentration of the insulin derivative of the present invention.</p>Example XIn vitro bioactivityGlucose uptake in adipocytes was used to evaluate the in vitro activity. 3T3-L1 cells, a murine fibroblast cell line was differenciated in adipocytes for used in the bioassay. 3T3-L1 cells were plated and grown to confluency in DMEM and 10% FBS, followed by an incubation for two days. Differentiation was induced by adding dexamethasone and insulin (D0). By day 7, more than 90% of the cells displayed an adipocyte phenotype, i.e. accumulation of lipid droplets. Figs. 4A-4C show preadipocytes, cells after 3 days and adipocytes at 7 days. Figs. 5A and 5B show oil red o staining of adipocytes at 4 days and adipocytes at 7 days. Figs. 6A and 6B show oil red o and methylene blue staining at 4 days and at 7 days.</p>3T3-L1 adipocytes were starved overnight in DMEM containing 5mM glucose and 0.5% FBS. Cells were rinsed in Kreb's-Ringer-Hepes buffer containing 1% BSA and incubated with increasing concentrations of insulin, DAC:insulin derivatives and their corresponding conjugate for 20 minutes at 37\u00b0C and witch [<sup>14</sup>C]-2-deoxy-D-glucose (1\u00b5Ci/well) for an additional 20 minutes. Cells were solubilized and radioactivity was measured. Glucose uptake (%) was calculated versus insulin control and EC50 were calculated using GraphPad PrisM\u2122 software.</p>Table 3 show the EC50 results for the compounds tested and Fig. 7 illustrates the glucose uptake in % of control in function of the concentration (M) of the compounds.\nTable 3CompoundEC50 (nM)Human insulin1.2Example III\nConjugate of Example III34\n48Example IV Conjugate of Example IV45 110</p>Example XIIn addition, glucose uptake in an other source of adipocytes was used to evaluate the in vitro activity. Epididymal fat obtained from Wistar derived male rats weighing 175 \u00b1 25 g is used. The tissue (0.03 g/ml) is degraded by collagenase in modified HEPES solution pH 7.4 at 37\u00b0C. Test compound and/or vehicle is incubated with 500 \u00b5l aliquots in modified HEPES buffer pH 7.4 and D-[3-3H]Glucose (2.5 \u00b5Ci/ml) is then added for 2 hour incubation. Test compound-induced the increase of glucose incorporation by more than 50 percent or more (\u226550%) relative to the control 2 nM insulin response, indicates possible insulin receptor agonist activity. Test compound inhibition of the insulin-induced glucose incorporation response by more than 50% indicates insulin receptor antagonist activity.
