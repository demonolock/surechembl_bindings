    ", comprising administering an effective dosage of an antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof that binds to the D-region of Sortilin. These diseases include i.a. FTD, ALS and TDP43 proteinopathies such as AD.</p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSFIG. 1 provides an overview of the generation of region assignment of human antibodies based on Sortilin region binding, effect on PGRN-binding and PGRN-levels and on cross-blocking between the antibodies.</p>Sortilin-binding antibodies were selected and assigned to regions A-E based on binding to shuffle constructs in which the sequence corresponded to the tetraodon Sortilin sequence within selected regions of the protein (Example 1, FIGS. 2A-2C).</p>20 antibodies which inhibited Sortilin-PGRN binding (as measured by HTRF analysis) were selected (see Example 10, FIG. 5 and FIG. 6). 15 of these antibodies were D-region antibodies while 3 were D+ antibodies (FIG. 6). Subsequent cross-blocking analysis showed that the 18 D-region and D+ antibodies (D+ antibodies have a different binding pattern to shuffle constructs than D-region antibodies. Nevertheless D+ antibodies cannot with certainty be assigned to a binding region A-E as outlined above but shared functional characteristics (cell assays etc.) similar to the D-region antibodies), all cross-blocked each other supporting that they interacted with the same Sortilin region (Example 9, FIG. 7). When sortilin antibodies of other region classes were tested in the HTRF sortilin-PGRN binding assay, only two of 41 antibodies exhibited an inhibitory effect. One of these two antibodies cross-blocked with the D and D+, but had an atypical shuffle construct binding pattern (D-like except that it bound the hB01-05 region), while the other antibody did not cross-block with the other antibodies that inhibited PGRN-sortilin binding, thus supporting the conclusion that it binds to another sortilin region.</p>These observations show that antibodies binding to an area in sortilin defined by the D-region have the potential to inhibit sortilin-PGRN binding.</p>19 cross-blocking antibodies, of which 18 were D-region and D+ antibodies, increased extracellular PGRN in a cellular assay (Example 13, FIG. 10 and FIG. 11). Three of these antibodies were tested in vivo and found to increase plasma PGRN (FIG. 13, Example 15).</p>The boxes in FIG. 1 illustrate steps in the selection of antibodies. A-E refer to the regions to which the respective Sortilin-binding antibodies were assigned based on shuffle constructs as described in Example 1 and SEQ ID NOs:171-179. \u201cOther\u201d refers to an antibody which could not be assigned to one region, and which may bind at the interface between the A- and B-regions. Tet refers to antibodies binding also tetraodon-Sortilin.</p>In addition to the human antibodies shown, a set of mouse anti-human sortilin antibodies was generated and similarly characterized. Two of these antibodies were assigned to the D Region and shown to cross block with human D",
    "s respectively. A \u201c+\u201d indicates binding to a given shuffle construct and a \u201c\u2212\u201d indicates lack of binding. Based on the binding pattern to the different shuffle constructs, antibodies were assigned to regions. The resultant antibody region classes are indicated by A-E. For the illustrated D and E region antibodies, both bound the human sequences (all grey) as indicated by \u201c+\u201d and neither bound the tetraodon sequence (all black) as indicated by \u201c\u2212\u201d, whereas the E region antibody bound the hB45678 shuffle construct while the D Region antibody did not bind resulting in the localisation of binding as illustrated in FIG. 2A. For D Region antibodies, binding to the following shuffle regions was observed: hsort, hB06-10, B12390. The antibodies did not bind to hB01-05, B45678, tet. For D+ antibodies, binding to the following shuffle region was observed: hsort, B12390. The antibodies did not bind to hB01-05, hB06-10, B45678, tet. The F binding pattern was similar to the D binding pattern except that no binding to the hB06-10 was observed for D+ antibodies.</p>The antibodies did not bind to the fully tetraodon Sortilin protein, except two. The two antibodies capable of binding the tetraodon sequence were denoted \u201ctet\u201d. \u201cOther\u201d refers to an antibody which could not be assigned to one region.</p>FIG. 3 shows the binding affinities of human D-region and D+ antibodies. Binding affinities to sortilin shuffle constructs by bioLayer interferometry using Octet 384RED as described in Example 8 (EC50, ng/ml). No shading indicates EC50 of 0.1-10 ng/ml, light grey shading indicates EC50 &gt;10 ng/ml and grey shading indicates no binding (NB). Region assignment was based on binding patterns is illustrated in FIGS. 2A-2C Shuffle constructs are illustrated in FIG. 2 and sequences are given in SEQ ID NOs:171-179. mAb=monoclonal antibody.</p>FIG. 4 shows the binding affinities of mouse anti-human antibodies to Sortilin shuffle constructs as obtained by bioLayer interferometry using Octet 384RED as described in Example 8 (EC50, ng/ml). No shading indicates binding and grey shading indicates no binding (NB). Region assignment based on binding patterns is illustrated in FIGS. 2A-2C.</p>FIG. 5 shows the effect of Sortilin antibody on Sortilin PGRN binding. The D Region Sortilin human monoclonal (humAb) antibody 45 (filled circles) prevented PGRN binding to Sortilin, in contrast to a control Sortilin E region antibody (filled triangles) and an IgG control, IgG1-b12 (open triangles) that did not interfere with the binding. The binding of antibodies was determined by measuring the displacement of PGRN binding to Sortilin using Homogenous Time Resolved Fluorescent (HTRF) (Example 10). Dose-response evaluation of antibodies was performed with ten concentrations covering 50 pM to 1 \u03bcM in a 3-fold dilution curve. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were calculated by non-linear regression using sigmoidal concentration response (variable slope) in XLfit 4 (IDBS, UK).</p>FIG. 6 Summary of effect of antibodies on Sortilin-PGRN binding determined by homogenous time resolved fluorescent (HTRF) analysis as shown in FIG. 5. In total, 62 antibodies were tested\u201415 D-region antibodies and 3 D+ antibodies were found to inhibit sortilin-PGRN binding and the IC50 values were determined. For two additional antibodies (E and other regions), an inhibitory effect was observed. All remaining antibodies were negative in the test. * antibody too weak to fit a dose-response curve. 6% inhibition at 1 \u03bcM. ** control (ctrl) antibody too weak to fir a dose-response curve. 37% inhibition at 1 \u03bcM.</p>These observations show that sortilin antibodies characterized by their D-region or D+ assignment inhibit sortilin's binding to PGRN directly and are capable of inhibiting sortilin-PGRN binding.</p>FIG. 7 shows cross-blocking between antibodies. Human antibodies and the mouse antibodies were all tested in a single experiment where each antibody was bound to human wild type (WT) Sortilin (FIG. 7). Subsequently all other antibodies were tested for binding to the preformed sortilin:antibody complex (Example 9). The selected 15 D-region and 3 D+ human antibodies (based on their effect in the HTRF PGRN-sortilin assay, (FIG. 5 and FIG. 6) and two mouse D Region antibodies all inhibited binding of each other to human WT Sortilin.</p>The antibodies did not cross-block with antibodies designated to other region classes (as illustrated for A-region, E-region and tetraodon recognizing antibodies numbered AbA1-x, AbE1-x and Abtet in the table respectively) except for one cross blocking A region antibody, one antibody with unknown region assignment (\u201cother\u201d) and a partial block for a D+ antibody 548. These data support that the D-region and D+ antibodies capab",

PGRN levels are normalized to untreated controls and given in %. Two antibodies were raised in mouse against human Sortilin (1F2F4 &amp; 5E1F6) and the rest are human antibodies.

One week later, antibodies were added to the cells. Media from the cells were collected at 48 hrs or 96 hrs and analysed by human PGRN ELISA (Enzo Life sciences) and samples analysed as per the manufacturer's instructions. Sortilin human antibodies 45 and 68 increased PGRN levels in the media at both time points. Control isotype antibodies B12 and Anti-Hel (negative control) did not change extracellular PGRN.

Mice were injected with 45 (n=5) or control (n=3) antibody sc at a dose of 10 mg/kg. Each group was sacrificed at different time points. In mice treated with control antibodies (Anti-Hel) there was no change in plasma PGRN, whereas in mice treated with 45 there was a gradual increase in PGRN levels. Effect appeared to peak between 24 and 48 hrs and gradually decreased by day 4-7.</p>FIG. 13B Subchronic study: Mice were treated twice a week with 10 mg/kg of 45 and control antibody (Anti-Hel).

    "f the parent monospecific bivalent antibody molecules. The resulting heterodimeric antibody contains one Fabs contributed from two different parent monospecific antibodies. Amino acid changes in the Fc domain leads to increased stability of the heterodimeric antibody with bispecificity that is stable over time. (Ridgway et al., Protein Engineering 9, 617-621 (1996), Gunasekaran et al., JBC 285, 19637-1(2010), Moore et al., MAbs 3:6 546-557 (2011), Strop et al., JMB 420, 204-219 (2012), Metz et al., Protein Engineering 25:10 571-580 (2012), Labrijn et al., PNAS 110:113, 5145-5150 (2013), Spreter Von Kreudenstein et al., MAbs 5:5 646-654 (2013)). Bispecific antibodies can also include molecules that are generated using ScFv fusions. Two monospecific scfv are then independently joined to Fc domains able to form stable heterodimers to generate a single bispecific molecule (Mabry et al., PEDS 23:3 115-127 (2010). Bispecific molecules have dual binding capabilities.</p>An \u201canti-Sortilin antibody\u201d or \u201cSortilin antibody\u201d (used interchangeably herein, depending on the context wherein its written) is an antibody an antigen-binding fragment thereof which binds specifically to Sortilin, and especially to the Sortilin D Region, SEQ ID NO:170. An anti-Sortilin antibody that binds to the Sortilin D Region will usually bind to a conformational epitope or a linear epitope of 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 consecutive amino acids within the D-Region (for example SEQ ID NOs:185, 186 or 187) with an affinity (IC50) at or below 22 nM, such as between 22 nM and 1 nM, between 10 nM and 1 nM or between 5 nM and 1 nM. According to some embodiments the anti-Sortilin antibodies may also bind to the A region (SEQ ID NOs:180, 181, 182, 183 or 184) although it's emphasized that their main biological function is believed to be achieved by binding to the D Region.</p>The binding site identified is rather unique as shown with for example the binding of the selective small molecule ligand AF38469 to Sortilin. The binding site for AF38469 has been shown to be similar to the binding site of neurotensin and characterized by X-ray crystallography (Schreder et al. Bioorg Med Chem Lett. 2014 Jan. 1; 24(1):177-80). PGRN has been reported to bind to the same site (Lee et al. Hum Mol Genet. 2013). Antibodies 45 and 68, binding to D-region, and D+ respectively, did not inhibit the binding of AF38469 to sortilin. This data suggests that these antibodies have a binding site for Sortilin distinct from the binding site for AF38469 and neurotensin. Therefore, in certain embodiments the invention relates to an antibody, or an antigen-binding fragment thereof, capable of specifically binding to Sortilin and inhibiting the binding of PGRN to Sortilin, but which binding does not inhibit or substantially inhibit the binding of neurotensin or AF38469 to Sortilin. This can be shown using for example displacement of binding to Sortilin using a scintillation proximity assay (SPA) (Example 11). One way of explaining th",

Canonical structures For The Hypervariable domains Of Immunoglobulins. J. Mol. Biol. 196, 901-917.</p>As used herein, an antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof is said to \u201cspecifically\u201d bind a region of another molecule (i.e., an epitope) if it reacts or associates more frequently, more rapidly, with greater duration and/or with greater affinity or avidity with that epitope relative to alternative epitopes. In one embodiment, the antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, of the invention binds at least 10-fold more strongly to its target (Sortilin) than to another molecule; preferably at least 50-fold more strongly and more preferably at least 100-fold more strongly. Preferably, the antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, binds under physiological conditions, for example, in vivo. Thus, by \u201cspecifically binding to Sortilin\u201d, we include the ability of the antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, to bind to Sortilin with such specificity and/or under such conditions. Methods suitable for determining such binding will be known to those skilled in the art, and exemplary methods are described in the accompanying Examples. As used herein, the term \u201cbinding\u201d in the context of the binding of an antibody to a predetermined antigen typically refers to binding with an affinity corresponding to a KD of about 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>M or less, such as about 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>M or less, such as about 10<sup>\u22129 </sup>M or less when determined by for instance surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology in either a BIAcore\u00ae 3000 or T200 instrument using the antigen as the ligand and the antibody as the analyte, and binds to the predetermined antigen with an affinity corresponding to a KD that is at least ten-fold lower, such as at least 100 fold lower, for instance at least 1,000 fold lower, such as at least 10,000 fold lower, for instance at least 100,000 fold lower than its affinity for binding to a non-specific antigen (e.g., BSA, casein) other than the predetermined antigen or a closely-related antigen. The amount with which the affinity is lower is dependent on the KD of the antibody, so that when the KD of the antibody is very low (that is, the antibody is highly specific), then the amount with which the affinity for the antigen is lower than the affinity for a non-specific antigen may be at least 10,000 fold. In particular, the invention pertains to anti-Sortilin antibodies that exhibit a binding affinity corresponding to at or below 22 nM, such as between 22 nM and 1 nM, between 10 nM and 1 nM or between 5 nM and 1 nM, when determined by, for instance, bioLayer interferometry using an Octet 384RED (Example 8).</p>In certain embodiments of the invention the invention relates to an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof able to compete with humAb antibody 45 or humAb antibody 68 for binding to Sortilin. In another embodiment the invention relates to an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof that is able to compete with antibody 45 for binding to the D Region of Sortilin as defined in SEQ ID NO:170. Such competitive binding inhibition can be determined using assays and methods well known in the art, for example using BIAcore\u00ae chips with immobilised human Sortilin and incubating with a reference antibody (such as antibody \u201c45\u201d or \u201c68\u201d) with and without an antibody polypeptide to be tested. Alternatively, a pair-wise mapping approach can be used, in which a reference antibody (such as antibody \u201c45\u201d or \u201c68\u201d) is immobilised to the surface of the BIAcore\u00ae chip, human Sortilin antigen is bound to the immobilised antibody, and then a second antibody is tested for simultaneous binding ability to human Sortilin (see \u2018BIAcore\u00ae Assay Handbook\u2019, GE Healthcare Life Sciences, 29-0194-00 AA May 2012; the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference).</p>The term \u201ckd\u201d (sec-1 or 1/s), as used herein, refers to the dissociation rate constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction.

Thus by \u201ccapability to increase the amount and/or concentration of PGRN in the brain\u201d includes the ability to increase the concentration of PGRN in the brain by at least 25% but preferably between 50 and 500 percent as measured by microdialysis.</p>In some antibodies, only part of a CDR, namely the subset of CDR residues req",

The animals were anaesthetized and sacrificed at various time points after dosing and plasma PGRN levels determined by ELISA.\nA. Time course study: Mice were treated with antibodies (a Sortilin humab or a control ab) and sacrificed at different time points. Mice treated with control antibodies (Anti-Hel), did not show change in plasma PGRN whereas in mice treated with Sortilin humab 45, there was an increase in PGRN levels which seemed to peak between 24 and 48 hrs and then gradually decreased from around day 4. PGRN levels were still elevated at day 7.B. Subchronic study: Based on the data from time course study, Sortilin KI mice were dosed twice a week with 10 mg/kg, s.c, with either Sortilin human antibody 45 or isotype control antibody, in order to maintain a steady antibody level for a subchronic study (4 weeks). Blood samples were collected at the start of the study and every week to follow plasma PGRN changes. Plasma PGRN levels at the start of the study were similar in both group of animals. Higher levels of plasma PGRN were seen in mice treated with Sortilin antibody45 from week 1 and remain elevated throughout the study. Mice treated with control ab, did not show any increase in plasma PGRN and remained at baseline levels (week 0).C. Dose response study: Different doses (4 doses: 10, 2, 0.4 and 0.1 mg/kg) of the Sortilin (45) and control antibody (Anti-Hel) were injected and mice sacrificed on day 2. Plasma PGRN was elevated with 10 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg in mice treated with Sortilin humab and the lower doses did not have an effect on the plasma PGRN which clearly shows a dose dependent effect of the Sortilin antibody on the plasma PGRN levels. Mice treated with control antibody did not show any change in PGRN levels.\n</p>Mice were anaesthetized with 0.4 ml Avertin IP and heart blood was collected and transferred to a 500 ul kEDTA vial.
