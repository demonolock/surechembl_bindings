    "thod of administration, and other factors known to physicians. The optimal dosage can be determined by a physician in the light of a number of parameters including, for example, age, sex, body weight, the severity of the condition being treated, the active ingredient being administered and the route of administration. A wide range of dosages can be employed. In view of oral administration to a human patient, for example, a dose of about 10 \u03bc g to about 1000 \u03bc g of the agent per human, optionally 3 to 4 doses, may be administered. Dosage regimens can be adjusted to provide the best therapeutic response and to reduce side effects. For example, several divided doses may be administered daily, weekly, monthly or other suitable time intervals, or the dose may be reduced proportionally according to the exigencies of the situation.</p>Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.</p>Description of the drawings</p>FIG. 1 shows the effect of IFN \u03b1 -14 on cytopathic effects following SARS-CoV-1 coronavirus infection.</p>FIG. 2 shows a graph demonstrating the effect of IFN \u03b1 -14 on plaque formation following SARS-CoV-1 coronavirus infection.</p>Figure 3 shows the results of a plaque inhibition assay using Vero cells of the SARS-CoV-2 plaque inhibition assay, in which IFN \u03b1 2a (a commercially available subtype) was compared to IFN \u03b1 14 and shows an IC 50-indicating that \u03b1 -14 is 20X more potent against Covid19 virus than \u03b1 -2 a.</p>Figure 4 shows the results of plaque inhibition assays using Vero cells in a study comparing 5 interferons (interferon- \u03b1 14, HYBRID2, HYBRID1, interferon- \u03b2 1a, interferon- \u03b1 2 a), again based on \u03b1 -2a comparison of the other 4 \"interferons\", with 20X, 10X, 5X higher potency than \u03b1 -2 a.</p>FIG. 5 shows the effect of interferon- \u03b1 14 on CXCL-10 synthesis by human endothelial cells. CXCL-10 is an attractant for anti-viral NK cells.</p>Figure 6 shows the rapid induction of granzyme B by interferon alpha 14. Granzyme B is caused to be released to kill the cells with the virus.</p>FIG. 7 shows inhibition of IL-17A synthesis by Hybrid 2. Interferon alpha 14 suppresses 17A and F very strongly. IL17 inflammation is thought to be a significant problem in ARDS.</p>FIG. 8 shows inhibition of IL 17F by Hybrid 2.</p>FIG. 9 shows the effect of Hybrid2 on CXCL 10 production by human leukocytes.</p>Fig. 10 shows the production of interferon gamma.</p>Figure 11 shows the secretion of TNF \u03b1.</p>Fig. 12 shows images from immune cells and Hybrid 2.</p>FIG. 13 shows that Hybrid2 can induce apoptosis.</p>Figure 14 shows NK cell aggregation.</p>FIG. 15 shows direct NK cell activation by Hybrid 2.</p>FIG. 16 shows inhibition of HYBRID2 assay on human RSV plaques.</p>Experimental data</p>The inventors examined the ability of synthetic interferon-alpha Hybrid2 to suppress viral infection using a model system based o"
