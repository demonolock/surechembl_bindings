    "ll-length antibody genes were constructed by first synthesizing the variable region sequences. The sequences were optimized for expression in mammalian cells. These variable region sequences were then cloned into expression vectors that already contain human Fc domains; for the heavy chain, the IgG1 was used.</p>Small scale production of humanized antibodies was carried out by transfecting plasmids for the heavy and light chains into suspension HEK293 cells using chemically defined media in the absence of serum. Whole antibodies in the conditioned media were purified using MabSelect SuRe Protein A medium (GE Healthcare).</p>Nine humanized antibodies were produced from each combination of the three heavy chains having the amino acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NO: 29, 31 and 33 and three light chains having the amino acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NO: 35, 37 and 39. A comparative chimeric parental antibody was also prepared. The antibodies and their respective titers are shown below in Table 7:\nTable 7: Antibody titersAntibodyTiter (mg/L)Chimeric parental23.00SEQ ID NO: 29 + SEQ ID NO: 3524.67SEQ ID NO: 29 + SEQ ID NO: 3741.67SEQ ID NO: 29 + SEQ ID NO: 3929.67SEQ ID NO: 31 + SEQ ID NO: 3526.00SEQ ID NO: 31 + SEQ ID NO: 3727.33SEQ ID NO: 31 + SEQ ID NO: 3935.33SEQ ID NO: 33 + SEQ ID NO: 3544.00SEQ ID NO: 33 + SEQ ID NO: 3730.33SEQ ID NO: 33 + SEQ ID NO: 3937.33</p>The binding of the humanized antibodies may be evaluated, for example, by dose-dependent binding ELISA or cell-based binding assay.</p>Example 6 (prophetic): killing of metastatic cancer cells, and treating metastatic cancerAggregates of human ovarian cancer cells (Creative BioArray, Shirley, NY) are inoculated i.p. into two groups (A and B) of T and B cell -deficient prkdcscid (SCID) mice, specifically NSG mice available from Jackson Laboratories (Farmington, CT). Group A is a control group injected intravenously with physiological saline and Group B is injected intravenously with 5 \u00b5g per gram per mouse of any of the anti-AGE monoclonal antibodies described.</p>80 days post inoculation with cancer cells, mice from both Groups A and B undergo gross and histological examination. The antibody-treated group B mice have significantly fewer metastatic foci than Group A control mice.</p>Example 6: In vivo study of the administration of a carboxymethyl lysine monoclonal antibodyThe effect of a carboxymethyl lysine antibody on tumor growth, metastatic potential and cachexia was investigated. In vivo studies were carried out in mice using a murine breast cancer tumor model. Female BALB/c mice (BALB/cAnNCrl, Charles River) were eleven weeks old on Day 1 of the study.</p>4T1 murine breast tumor cells (ATCC CRL-2539) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 25 \u00b5g/mL gentamicin, 100 units/mL penicillin G Na and 100 \u00b5g/mL streptomycin sulfate. Tumor cells were maintained in tissue culture flasks in a humidified incubator at 37 \u00b0C in an atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>"
