In another embodiment, the compounds do not exhibit significant inhibitory activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme. One measure of the ability of a compound to inhibit NEP activity is the inhibition constant (pK,). The pK, value is the negative logarithm to base 10 of the dissociation constant (K,), which is typically reported in molar units. Compounds of the invention of particular interest are those having a pK, at NEP greater than or equal to 6.0, particularly those having a pK, greater than or equal to 7.0, and even more particularly those having a pK, greater than or equal to 8.0. In one embodiment, compounds of interest have a pK, in the range of 6.0-6.9; in another embodiment, compounds of interest have a pK, in the range of 7.0-7.9; in yet another embodiment, compounds of interest have a pK, in the range of 8.0-8.9; and in still another embodiment, compounds of interest have a pK, in the range of greater than or equal to 9.0. Such values can be determined by techniques that are well known in the art, as well as in the assays described herein.</p>Another measure of the ability of a compound to inhibit NEP activity is the apparent inhibition constant (IC<sub>50</sub>), which is the molar concentration of compound that results in half-maximal inhibition of substrate conversion by the NEP enzyme. The pIC<sub>50 </sub>value is the negative logarithm to base 10 of the IC<sub>50</sub>. Compounds of the invention that are of particular interest, include those that exhibit a pIC<sub>50 </sub>for NEP greater than or equal to about 5.0. Compounds of interest also include those having a pIC<sub>50 </sub>for NEP\u2267about 6.0 or a pIC<sub>50 </sub>for NEP\u2267about 7.0. In another embodiment, compounds of interest have a pIC<sub>50 </sub>for NEP within the range of about 7.0-11.0; and in another embodiment, within the range of about 8.0-11.0, such as within the range of about 8.0-10.0.</p>It is noted that in some cases, compounds of the invention may possess weak NEP inhibition activity. In such cases, those of skill in the art will recognize that these compounds still have utility as research tools.</p>Exemplary assays to determine properties of compounds of the invention, such as the NEP inhibiting activity, are described in the Examples and include by way of illustration and not limitation, assays that measure NEP inhibition (described in Assay 1). Useful secondary assays include assays to measure ACE inhibition (also described in Assay 1) and aminopeptidase P (APP) inhibition (described in Sulpizio et al. (2005) JPET 315:1306-1313).

Any suitable biological system or sample having a NEP enzyme may be employed in such studies which may be conducted either in vitro or in vivo. Representative biological systems or samples suitable for such studies include, but are not limited to, cells, cellular extracts, plasma membranes, tissue samples, isolated organs, mammals (such as mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, dogs, pigs, humans, and so forth), and the like, with mammals being of particular interest. In one particular embodiment of the invention, NEP enzyme activity in a mammal is inhibited by administering a NEP-inhibiting amount of a compound of the invention. Compounds of the invention can also be used as research tools by conducting biological assays using such compounds.</p>When used as a research tool, a biological system or sample comprising a NEP enzyme is typically contacted with a NEP enzyme-inhibiting amount of a compound of the invention. After the biological system or sample is exposed to the compound, the effects of inhibiting the NEP enzyme are determined using conventional procedures and equipment, such as by measuring receptor binding in a binding assay or measuring ligand-mediated changes in a functional assay. Exposure encompasses contacting cells or tissue with the compound, administering the compound to a mammal, for example by i.p., p.o, i.v., s.c., or inhaled administration, and so forth. This determining step can involve measuring a response (a quantitative analysis) or can involve making an observation (a qualitative analysis). Measuring a response involves, for example, determining the effects of the compound on the biological system or sample using conventional procedures and equipment, such as enzyme activity assays and measuring enzyme substrate or product mediated changes in functional assays. The assay results can be used to determine the activity level as well as the amount of compound necessary to achieve the desired result, that is, a NEP enzyme-inhibiting amount. Typically, the determining step will involve determining the effects of inhibiting the NEP enzyme.</p>Additionally, compounds of the invention can be used as research tools for evaluating other chemical compounds, and thus are also useful in screening assays to discover, for example, new compounds having NEP-inhibiting activity. In this manner, a compound of the invention is used as a standard in an assay to allow comparison of the results obtained with a test compound and with compounds of the invention to identify those test compounds that have about equal or superior activity, if any. For example, pK, data for a test compound or a ",
