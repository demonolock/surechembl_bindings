Neurochem. 47:1948 (1986)). For \n\nexample, H-Nicotine (80 ci/mmol; New England Nuclear Corporation, Boston, IVLA) can be used as the ligand for nicotinic acetylcholine receptor binding assays.</p>\n  An exemplary binding assay can be performed as follows. Decapitate Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250 - 400 gm) and remove the brains and dissect the cerebral cortex on ice. Synaptic membranes can be prepared by homogenizing the cortical tissue in 20 volumes of ice-cold modified Tris buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF) with a polytron (20 sec at setting 5-6) followed by centrifugation (15 min at 25,000 x g) at 4\u00b0C. Rehomogenize the resultant pellet and centrifuge twice. Resuspend the final pellet in ice-cold assay buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) at a concentration of membrane equivalent to 1 gm wet weight cortex per 10 ml buffer. After protein determination dilute the final membrane preparation with buffer to 3 mg protein/ml. This membrane preparation can be used in either the fresh state or frozen (-70\u00b0C) then thawed.</p>\n  The binding assay can be performed manually using 96-well plates, or using a Biomek automated work station (Beckman Instrument Co.). Dilute H-Nicotine in assay buffer to give a final concentration of 1.9 nM. Program the Biomek automated work station to automatically transfer 750 \u03bcl of assay buffer with H-nicotine, 230 \u03bcl of membrane preparation and 20 \u03bcl of solution containing the \n\ncompound of interest in assay buffer, DMSO, ethanol :DMSO (1:1) or appropriate vehicle to the 96-well plate. Add Atropine to the incubation buffer at a final concentration of 3 \u03bcM to block binding to muscarinic acetylcholine receptor sites. Maintain the plates on ice for 60 min and separate the tissue-bound radioactivity from the free by rapid filtration in a Brandel Harvester onto GF/C filters presoaked in 0.5% polyethyleneimine for at least 2 hr. Wash the filters with 4x2 ml of ice-cold assay buffer and transfer the filters to vials to which 4 ml of scintillation cocktail has been added. Measure the radioactivity in a LS-6500 Beckman Liquid Scintillation Counter in an auto-dpm mode. Data can be analyzed by log- logit transformation or non-linear regression analysis (e.g., employing GraphPad Prism, available from GraphPad</p>\n  Software, San Diego, CA) to give IC<sub>50</sub> values. Non-specific binding can be defined by lO\u03bcM cytisine.</p>\n  Example 36 Neurotransmitter Release</p>\n  Measurement of H-dopamine (<sup>3</sup>H-DA) release from rat striatal slices can be performed according to the method"
