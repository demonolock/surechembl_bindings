    " and methoxy. </p>The term \"halogen-Ci-6-alkoxy\", alone or in combination with other groups, refers to Ci_6- alkoxy as defined herein, which is substituted by one or multiple halogens, in particular fluoro. Particular \"halogen-Ci-6-alkoxy\" are fluoro-Ci-6-alkoxy. Specific \"halogen-Ci-6-alkoxy\" are CHF2-CF2-CH2-O-, CHF2-O- and CF2-O-. The terms \"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\" and \"pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substance\" refer to carriers and auxiliary substances such as diluents or excipients that are compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation. </p>The term \"pharmaceutical composition\" encompasses a product comprising specified ingredients in pre-determined amounts or proportions, as well as any product that results, directly or indirectly, from combining specified ingredients in specified amounts. Particularly it encompasses a product comprising one or more active ingredients, and an optional carrier comprising inert ingredients, as well as any product that results, directly or indirectly, from combination, complexation or aggregation of any two or more of the ingredients, or from dissociation of one or more of the ingredients, or from other types of reactions or interactions of one or more of the ingredients. \n\n The term \"inhibitor\" denotes a compound which competes with, reduces or prevents the binding of a particular ligand to particular receptor or which reduces or prevents the inhibition of the function of a particular protein. </p>The term \"half maximal inhibitory concentration\" (IC5<sub>0</sub>) denotes the concentration of a particular compound required for obtaining 50% inhibition of a biological process in vitro. IC5<sub>0</sub> values can be converted logarithmically to pICso values (-log IC5<sub>0</sub>), in which higher values indicate exponentially greater potency. The IC5<sub>0</sub> value is not an absolute value but depends on experimental conditions e.g. concentrations employed. The IC50 value can be converted to an absolute inhibition constant (Ki) using the Cheng-Prus off equation (Biochem. Pharmacol. (1973) 22:3099). The term \"inhibition constant\" (Ki) denotes the absolute binding affinity of a particular inhibitor to a receptor. It is measured using competition binding assays and is equal to the concentration where the particular inhibitor would occupy 50% of the receptors if no competing ligand (e.g. a radioligand) was present. Ki values can be converted logarithmically to pKi values (-log Ki), in which higher values indicate exponentially greater potency. \"Therapeutically effective amount\" means an amount of a compound that, when administered to a subject for treating a disease state, is sufficient to effect such treatment for the disease state. The \"therapeutically effective amount\" will vary depending on the compound, disease state being treated, the severity or the disease treated, the age and relative health of the subject, the route and form of administration, the judgment of the attending medical or veterinary practitioner, and other factors. </p>The term \"as defined herein\" and \"as described herein\" when referring to a variable incorporates by reference the broad definition of the variable as well as particularly, more particularly and most particularly definitions, if any. </p>The terms \"treating\", \"contacting\" and \"reacting\" when referring to a chemical reaction means adding or mixing two or more reagents under appropriate conditions to produce the indicated and/or the desired product. It should be appreciated that the reaction which produces the indicated and/or the desired product may not necessarily result directly from the combination of two reagents which were initially added, i.e., there may be one or more intermediates which are produced in the mixture which ultimately leads to the formation of the indicated and/or the desired product. </p>The term \"aromatic\" denotes the conventional idea of aromaticity as defined in the literature, in particul"
