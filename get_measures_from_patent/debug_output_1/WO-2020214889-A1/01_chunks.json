It will be appreciated by a person of skill in the art, upon reading the present disclosure that carrier moieties may interact with a target area, for example, skin or mucosa, through hydrophobic interactions. In addition, it will also be appreciated that carrier moieties, in some embodiments, may interact with a target area through covalent conjugation or ionic interactions. </p> [0058] In some embodiments, a carrier moiety as described herein can be used to retain and target actives, for example within one or more bodily tissues that may be characterized by high levels of those ECM proteins found in the skin. In some embodiments, ECM proteins found in the skin include, but are not limited, to keratin, elastin, or collagen. It will be appreciated by a person of skill in the art reading the present disclosure that, in some embodiments, a bodily tissue may comprise a mucous membrane. </p> [0059] Additional chemical structures of benzothiazoles include, but are not limited to, those described in European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 5 June 2015, Vol.97, pp.911-927, Curr Top Med Chem. 2017;17(2):208-237, PLANT SOIL ENVIRON., 51, 2005 (11): 496-505, Medicinal Chemistry Research, September 2012, Volume 21, Issue 9, pp 2644-2651. </p> Linkers </p>[0060] In some embodiments, a system that can penetrate skin comprises a linker whic"
