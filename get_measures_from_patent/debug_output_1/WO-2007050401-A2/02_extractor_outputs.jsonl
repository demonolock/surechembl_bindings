{"raw_mentions": "Here are the extracted sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n* For purposes of this specification NSAID' s which are selective inhibitors of COX-2 are defined as those which possess a specificity for inhibiting COX-2 over COX-I of at least 100 fold as measured by the ratio of IC50 for COX-2 over IC50 for COX-I evaluated by cell or microsomal assays.\n* Inhibitors of COX-2 that are particularly useful in the instant method of treatment are: 3- phenyl-4-(4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl)-2-(5H)-furanone; and 5-chloro-3-(4-methylsulfonyl)-phenyl-2-(2- methyl-5-pyridinyl)pyridine; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n* Compounds that have been described as specific inhibitors of COX-2 and are therefore useful in the present invention include, but are not limited to: parecoxib, CELEBREX<sup>\u00ae</sup> and BEXTRA<sup>\u00ae</sup> or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\nNote that these sentences do not explicitly mention a specific numeric value for a bioactivity metric with a unit. However, the first sentence mentions a ratio of IC50 values, which implies a specific numeric value (100 fold) and a unit (fold). The other two sentences do not meet the criteria as they do not mention a specific numeric value for a bioactivity metric with a unit.\n\nAfter re-reading the text, I found another sentence that meets the criteria:\n\n* Inhibitors of PDK (for example LY294002) \n\nThis sentence mentions a specific molecule (LY294002), a bioactivity metric is not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred that the molecule is an inhibitor, which implies a certain level of activity. However, there is no specific numeric value or unit mentioned.\n\nUnfortunately, the provided text does not contain many sentences that meet the criteria. If you have more text to analyze, I may be able to find more relevant sentences."}
