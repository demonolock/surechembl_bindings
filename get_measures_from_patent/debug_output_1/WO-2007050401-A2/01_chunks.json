    "ents. Such agents include inhibitors of ATR, ATM, the Chkl and Chk2 kinases and cdk and cdc kinase inhibitors and are specifically exemplified by 7-hydroxystaurosporin, flavopiridol, CYC202 (Cyclacel) and BMS-387032.</p>\"Inhibitors of cell proliferation and survival signaling pathway\" refer to pharmaceutical agents that inhibit cell surface receptors and signal transduction cascades downstream of those surface receptors. Such agents include inhibitors of inhibitors of EGFR (for example gefitinib and erlotinib), inhibitors of ERB-2 (for example trastuzumab), inhibitors of IGFR, inhibitors of cytokine receptors, inhibitors of MET, inhibitors of PDK (for example LY294002), serine/threonine kinases (including but not limited to inhibitors of Akt such as described in WO 02/083064, WO 02/083139, WO 02/083140 and WO 02/083138), inhibitors of Raf kinase (for example BAY-43-9006 ), inhibitors of MEK (for example CI-1040 and PD-098059) and inhibitors of mTOR (for example Wyeth CCI-779). Such agents include small molecule inhibitor compounds and antibody antagonists. \"Apoptosis inducing agents\" include activators of TNF receptor family members</p>(including the TRAIL receptors).</p>The invention also encompasses combinations with NSAID' s which are selective COX-2 inhibitors. For purposes of this specification NSAID' s which are selective inhibitors of COX-2 are defined as those which possess a specificity for inhibiting COX-2 over COX-I of at least 100 fold as measured by the ratio of IC50 for COX-2 over IC50 for COX-I evaluated by cell or microsomal assays.</p>Such compounds include, but are not limited to those disclosed in U.S. Pat. 5,474,995, U.S. Pat.</p>5,861,419, U.S. Pat. 6,001,843, U.S. Pat. 6,020,343, U.S. Pat. 5,409,944, U.S. Pat. 5,436,265, U.S. Pat.</p>5,536,752, U.S. Pat. 5,550,142, U.S. Pat. 5,604,260, U.S. 5,698,584, U.S. Pat. 5,710,140, WO 94/15932,</p>U.S. Pat. 5,344,991, U.S. Pat. 5,134,142, U.S. Pat. 5,380,738, U.S. Pat. 5,393,790, U.S. Pat. 5,466,823, U.S. Pat. 5,633,272, and U.S. Pat. 5,932,598, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>Inhibitors of COX-2 that are particularly useful in the instant method of treatment are: 3- phenyl-4-(4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl)-2-(5H)-furanone; and 5-chloro-3-(4-methylsulfonyl)-phenyl-2-(2- methyl-5-pyridinyl)pyridine; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.</p>Compounds that have been described as specific inhibitors of COX-2 and are therefore useful in the present invention include, but are not limited to: parecoxib, CELEBREX<sup>\u00ae</sup> and BEXTRA<sup>\u00ae</sup> or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.</p>Other examples of angiogenesis inhibitors include, but are not limited to, endostatin, ukrain, ranpirnase, IM862, 5-methoxy-4-[2-methyl-3-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)oxkanyl]-l-oxaspiro[2,5]oct-</p>6-yl(chloroacetyl)carbamate, acetyldinanaline, 5-amino-l-[[3,5-dichloro-4-(4-chlorobenzoyl)- phenyl]methyl]-l\u0397-l,2,3-triazole-4-carboxamide,CM101, squalamine, combretastatin, RPI4610,</p>NX31838, sulfated ma"
