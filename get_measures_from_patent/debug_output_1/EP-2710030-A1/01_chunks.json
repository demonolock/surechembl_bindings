    "evaluated, said application being performed under conditions that enable binding of said affinity ligand to RBM3 protein present in said sample; </p> a2) removing non-bound affinity ligand; and </p> a3) quantifying the affinity ligand remaining in association with said sample to evaluate said amount. </p> \"Affinity ligand remaining in association with the sample\" refers to affinity ligand which was not removed in step a2), e.g., the affinity ligand \n\n bound to the sample. Here, the binding may for example be the interaction between antibody and antigen. </p> However, in some embodiments, the removal of non-bound affinity ligand according to a2), e.g. the washing, is not always necessary. Thus, in some embodiments of the methods of the aspects above, step a) may comprise: </p> al) applying to said sample a quantifiable affinity ligand capable of selective interaction with the RBM3 protein to be evaluated, said application being performed under conditions that enable binding of said affinity ligand to RBM3 protein present in said sample; </p> all) quantifying the affinity bound to said sample to evaluate said amount. </p> In the context of the present disclosure, \"specific\" or \"selective\" interaction of e.g., an affinity ligand with its target or antigen means that the interaction is such that a distinction between specific and non-specific, or between selective and non-selective, interaction becomes meaningful. The interaction between two proteins is sometimes measured by the dissociation constant. The dissociation constant describes the strength of binding (or affinity) between two molecules. Typically the dissociation constant between an antibody and its antigen is from 10<sup>\"7</sup> to 10<sup>\"11</sup> M. However, high </p>specificity/selectivity does not necessarily require high affinity. Molecules with low affinity (in the molar range) for its counterpart have been shown to be as selective/specific as molecules with much higher affinity. In the case of the present disclosure, a specific or selective interaction refers to the extent to which a particular method can be used to determine the presence and/or amount of a specific protein, the target protein, under given conditions in the presence of other proteins in a tissue sample or fluid sample of a naturally occurring or processed biological fluid. In other words, specificity or selectivity is the capacity to distinguish between related proteins. For example, the specificity or selectivity of an antibody may be determined as in Examples, Section 2, below, wherein analysis is performed using a protein array set-up, a suspension bead array and a multiplexed competition assay, respectively. Specificity and selectivity determinations are also described in Nilsson P e\u00a3 al. (2005) Proteomics 5:4327-4337. </p> It is regarded as within the capabilities of those of ordinary skill in the art to select or manufacture the proper affinity ligand and to select the proper format and conditions for detection and/or quantification. Nevertheless, \n\n examples of affinity ligands that may prove useful, as well as examples of formats and cond",
    "ins presenting a single randomized loop used for the generation of novel binding specificities, protein scaffolds with a rigid secondary structure where side chains protruding from the protein surface are randomized for the generation of novel binding specificities, and scaffolds exhibiting a non-contiguous hyper-variable loop region used for the </p>generation of novel binding specificities. </p> In addition to non-immunoglobulin proteins, oligonucleotides may also be used as affinity ligands. Single stranded nucleic acids, called aptamers or decoys, fold into well-defined three-dimensional structures and bind to their target with high affinity and specificity. (Ellington AD and Szostak JW (1990) Nature 346:818-822; Brody EN and Gold L (2000) J. Biotechnol. 74:5-13; Mayer G and Jenne A (2004) BioDrugs 18:351 -359). The oligonucleotide ligands can be either RNA or DNA and can bind to a wide range of target molecule classes. </p> For selection of the desired affinity ligand from a pool of variants of any of the scaffold structures mentioned above, a number of selection platforms are available for the isolation of a specific novel ligand against a target protein of choice. Selection platforms include, but are not limited to, phage display (Smith GP (1985) Science 228:1315-1317), ribosome display (Hanes J and Pluckthun A (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 94:4937-4942), yeast two- hybrid system (Fields S and Song O (1989) Nature 340:245-246), yeast display (Gai SA and Wittrup KD (2007) Curr Opin Struct Biol 17:467-473), mRNA display (Roberts RW and Szostak JW (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 94:12297-12302), bacterial display (Daugherty PS (2007) Curr Opin Struct Biol 17:474-480, Kronqvist N et al. (2008) Protein Eng Des Sel 1 -9,</p>Harvey BR et al. (2004) PNAS 101 (25):913-9198), microbead display (Nord O et al. (2003) J Biotechnol 106:1 -13, WO01/05808), SELEX (System Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment) (Tuerk C and Gold L (1990) Science 249:505-510) and protein fragment complementation assays (PCA) (Remy I and Michnick SW (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 96:5394-5399). \n\n Thus, in embodiments of the present disclosure, the affinity ligand may be a non-immunoglobulin affinity ligand derived from any of the protein scaffolds listed above, or an oligonucleotide molecule. </p> As mentioned above, the RBM3 protein fragment SEQ ID NO:1 was designed to consist of a unique sequence with low sequence identity to other human proteins and to minimize cross reactivity of generated affinity reagents. Consequently, in embodiments of the present disclosure, the affinity ligand may be capable of selective interaction with a polypeptide consisting of the amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO:1 . </p> The epitope regions SEQ ID NO:4 and 5 has been identified within</p>SEQ ID NO:1 . Thus, in some embodiments, the affinity ligand of the present disclosure is capable of selective interaction with a peptide consisting of an amino acid sequence selected "
