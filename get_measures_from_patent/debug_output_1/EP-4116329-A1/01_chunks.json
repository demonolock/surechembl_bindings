    " term \"immunogenicity\" refers to the ability of an immunogen, antigen, or vaccine to stimulate an immune response.</p>As used herein, the term \"epitope\" is defined as the parts of an antigen molecule which contact the antigen binding site of an antibody or a T cell receptor.</p>As used herein, the term \"specifically binding,\" refers to the interaction between binding pairs (e.g., an antibody and an antigen). In various instances, specifically binding can be embodied by an affinity constant of about 10-6 moles/liter, about 10-7 moles/liter, or about 10-8 moles/liter, or less.</p>An \"isolated\" antibody is one which has been identified and separated and/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with research, diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes.</p>The phrase \"substantially similar,\" \"substantially the same\", \"equivalent\", or \"substantially equivalent\", as used herein, denotes a sufficiently high degree of similarity between two numeric values (for example, one associated with a molecule and the other associated with a reference/comparator molecule) such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of little or no biological and/or statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by said values (e.g., Kd values, anti-viral effects, etc.). The difference between said two values is, for example, less than about 50%, less than about 40%, less than about 30%, less than about 20%, and/or less than about 10% as a function of the value for the reference/comparator molecule.</p>The phrase \"substantially reduced,\" or \"substantially different\", as used herein, denotes a sufficiently high degree of difference between two numeric values (generally one associated with a molecule and the other associated with a reference/comparator molecule) such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to be of statistical significance within the context of the biological characteristic measured by said values (e.g., Kd values). The difference between said two values is, for example, greater than about 10%, greater than about 20%, greater than about 30%, greater than about 40%, and/or greater than about 50% as a function of the value for the reference/comparator molecule.</p>\"Binding affinity\" generally refers to the strength of the sum total of noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a (e.g., an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g., an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, \"binding affinity\" refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1:1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., antibody and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (Kd). Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art, including those described herein. Low-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to dissociate readily, whereas high-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain bound longer. A variety of methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art, any of which can be used for purposes of the present invention. Specific illustrative embodiments are described in the following.</p>The \"variable region\" or \"variable domain\" of an antibody refers to the amino-terminal domains of heavy or light chain of the antibody. These domains are generally the most variable parts of an antibody and contain the antigen-binding sites.</p>The term \"variable\" refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) or hypervariable regions both in the light-chain and the heavy-chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework (FR). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions, largely adopting a beta-sheet configuration, connected by three CDRs, which form loops conn",
    "DTA, 0.005% surfactant P20) as running buffer. The (Fab')<sub>2</sub> fragment of goat anti-human (Fab')<sub>2</sub> (Jackson Immuno Research Inc.) was utilized to capture antibody samples after immobilized onto both the reference and active channels of CM5 sensor chip. Interactions between glycoengineered antibodies and complex-type glycosylated Fc\u03b3RIIIA (expressed from HEK293 cells) were recorded through single cycle kinetic methods using five different concentrations of Fc\u03b3RIIIA at 30ul/min for association with 240 seconds followed by dissociation time of 420 seconds. Data was processed with double-referencing for background subtraction and fitted to 1:1 Langmuir binding model in BiaEvaluation software (GE Healthcare) to get kinetic/affinity constants.</p>Fc\u03b3RIIIA was transfected into HEK-293 cell line to express recombinant protein. The secreted Fc\u03b3RIIIA recombinant protein was purified and then diluted to serial concentration in HBS-EP buffer (200 nM,100 nM, 50 nM, 25 nM, and 12.5 nM). Each of anti-HER2 GAb101, GAb102, GAb103, GAb104, GAb105, GAb106, GAb107, GAb108, GAb109, GAb110 and GAb111 was diluted in HBS-EP buffer to the concentration of 10 mg/ml, and then captured to the CM5 chip in which anti-human Fab domain antibodies were pre-immobilized. A serial titration of Fc\u03b3RIIIA was injected and bound at the flow rate of 30 ml/min. Single cycle kinetics data was fitted into 1:1 binding model using Biacore T200 evaluation software to measure the equilibrium constant (Ka/Kd). The results were shown in Table 4.</p>NUMBERED EMBODIMENTSNumberered Embodiment 1A composition of anti-HER2 glycoantibodies or antigen binding fragments comprising a homogeneous population of anti-HER2 IgG molecules having the same N-glycan on the Fc region of each anti-HER2 IgG molecule.</p>Numberered Embodiment 2The composition of numberered embodiment 1, wherein the anti-HER2 IgG molecule comprises a heavy chain having the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1, and a light chain having the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2.</p>Numberered Embodiment 3The composition of numberered embodiment 1, wherein the anti-HER2 IgG molecule comprises a light chain sequence and a heavy chain sequence of Trastuzumab (Herceptin).</p>Numberered Embodiment 4The composition of numberered embodiment 1, characterized in that the anti-HER2 glycoantibodies have improved ADCC over Trastuzumab.</p>Numberered Embodiment 5The composition of numberered embodiment 1, characterized in that the anti-HER2 glycoantibodies improved binding to Fc\u03b3RIIIA over Trastuzumab.</p>Numberered Embodiment 6The composition of numberered embodiment 1, wherein the N-glycan is attached to the Asn-297 of the Fc region.</p>Numberered Embodiment 7The composition of numberered embodiment 1, wherein the N-glycan is free of fucose.</p>Numberered Embodiment 8The composition of numberered embodiment 1, wherein the N-glycan comprises at least one \u03b12-6 terminal sialic acid.</p>Numberered Embodiment 9The comp"
