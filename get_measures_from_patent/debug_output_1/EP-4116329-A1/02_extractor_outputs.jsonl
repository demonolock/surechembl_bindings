{"raw_mentions": "Unfortunately, there are no sentences that meet the specified criteria in the provided text snippet. The text does not contain specific molecule names, bioactivity metrics, numeric values, and units together in a single sentence.\n\nHowever, I can suggest some sentences that contain some of the required components, but not all:\n\n* The secreted Fc\u03b3RIIIA recombinant protein was purified and then diluted to serial concentration in HBS-EP buffer (200 nM,100 nM, 50 nM, 25 nM, and 12.5 nM). (contains molecule name, numeric values, and units, but no bioactivity metric)\n* Single cycle kinetics data was fitted into 1:1 binding model using Biacore T200 evaluation software to measure the equilibrium constant (Ka/Kd). (contains bioactivity metric, but no specific molecule name, numeric value, or unit)\n\nIf you provide more text or context, I may be able to find relevant sentences that meet the specified criteria."}
