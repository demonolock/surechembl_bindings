Typically, under stringent conditions a probe will hybridize to its target subsequence in a complex mixture of nucleic acid (including but not limited to, total cellular or library DNA or RNA) but does not hybridize to other sequences in the complex mixture. Stringent conditions are sequence-dependent and will be different in different circumstances. Longer sequences hybridize specifically at higher temperatures. An extensive guide to the hybridization of nucleic acids is found in Tijssen, Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology\u2014Hybridization with Nucleic Probes, \u201cOverview of principles of hybridization and the strategy of nucleic acid assays\u201d (1993).</p>As used herein, an \u201cantibody\u201d or \u201cimmunoglobulin\u201d refers to a polypeptide substantially encoded by an immunoglobulin gene or immunoglobulin genes, or fragments thereof, which specifically bind and recognize an analyte (antigen). The recognized immunoglobulin genes include the kappa, lambda, alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon and mu constant region genes, as well as the myriad immunoglobulin variable region genes. Light chains are classified as either kappa or lambda. Heavy chains are classified as gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon, which in turn define the immunoglobulin classes, IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE, respectively.</p>An exemplary immunoglobulin (antibody) structural unit is composed of two pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one \u201clight\u201d (about 25 kD) and one \u201cheavy\u201d chain (about 50-70 kD). The N-terminal domain of each chain defines a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The terms variable light chain (VL) and variable heavy chain (VH) refer to these light and heavy chain domains respectively. The IgG1 heavy chain comprises of the VH, CH1, CH2 and CH3 domains respectively from the N to C-terminus. The light chain comprises of the VL and CL domains from N to C terminus. The IgG1 heavy chain comprises a hinge between the CH1 and CH2 domains. In certain embodiments, the immunoglobulin constructs comprise at least one immunoglobulin domain from IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, or IgE connected to a therapeutic polypeptide. In some embodiments, the immunoglobulin domain comprised in an immunoglobulin construct provided herein, is from an immunoglobulin based construct such as a diabody, or a nanobody. In certain embodiments, the immunoglobulin constructs described herein comprise at least one immunoglobulin domain from a heavy chain antibody such as a camelid antibody. In certain embodiments, the immunoglobulin constructs provided herein comprise at least one immunoglobulin domain from a mammalian antibody such as a bovine antibody, a human antibody, a camelid antibody, a mouse antibody or any chimeric antibody.</p>As used herein, the term \u201cantigenic determinant\u201d is synonymous with \u201cantigen\u201d and \u201cepitope,\u201d and refers to a site (e.g. a contiguous stretch of amino acids or a conformational configuration made up",

Bridged T-B cells appear in top right quadrant. This result demonstrates that at 300 nM, heteromultimer v873 is able to specifically bridge Jurkat T cells and Raji B cells to a similar extent (23% of total cells) as BiTE (21% of total cells).</p>Example 4: Heteromultimers Bind Selectively to CD3- and CD19-Expressing CellsThe ability of an exemplary heteromultimer, v873, to bind specifically to CD3 and CD19 was assessed by FACS. One-armed antibodies (OAAs) against CD3 and CD19 were also prepared as described in Example 2 and tested as controls in the whole cell FACS binding assay described below.</p>Whole Cell Binding by FACS Protocol:</p>2\u00d710<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml cells (&gt;80% viability) were resuspended in L10+GS1 media, mixed with antibody dilutions, and incubated on ice for 1 h.</p>Cells were washed by adding 10 ml of cold R-2 buffer, and centrifuging at 233 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0 C. The cell pellet was resuspended with 100 \u03bcl (1/100 dilution in L10+GS1 media) of fluorescently labeled anti-mouse or anti-human IgG and incubated for 1 h at RT.</p>Cell treatments were washed by adding 10 ml of cold R-2 as previously described, and the cell pellet resuspended with 400 \u03bcl of cold L-2 and the sample was filtered through Nitex and added to a tube containing 4 \u03bcl of propidium iodide.</p>Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry.</p>The results are shown in FIG. 2 and demonstrate that v873 is able to selectively bind and bridge to CD3-expressing Jurkat T cells (lower panel) and to CD19-expressing Raji B cells (upper panel). FIG. 2 also demonstrates that the one-armed anti-CD3 antibody specifically binds to Jurkat T cells and does not cross-react to CD19 expressing B cells, and that the one-armed anti-CD19 antibody specifically binds to Raji B cells and does not cross-react to Jurkat T cells.</p>This experiment was repeated and results are shown in FIG. 9. As in the previous experiment, the FACS assay shows that v873 binds selectively to Jurkat T-cells and to Raji B-cells (FIG. 9 B). FIG. 9A shows that human IgG (hIgG) does not bind to Jurkat T-cel",

The v1092 construct was additionally tested against v873 and the v891 BiTE control for B-cell and T-cell binding according to the method described in Example 4.</p>The results are shown in FIG. 5A and indicate that at the concentration tested, v1092 was able to bridge 31% of total cells, and v873 was able to bridge 25% of total cells (lower panels). The upper panels are the results using media as a control. As described in Example 3, the ability of v873 to bridge B-cells and T-cells is comparable to that of the v891 BiTE control. FIG. 5A further indicates that the ability of v1092 to bridge B-cells and T-cells is comparable to that of v873.</p>In an additional experiment, the ability of v1092 to bridge T-cells and B-cells was directly compared to the v221 control and to v873 and the v891 control. The results are shown in FIG. 5B which demonstrates that v1092 is able to bridge Jurkat T cells and Raji B cells to a greater extent than v221 and similar to v891 and v873.</p>Example 13: Exemplary Heteromultimers have Higher Anti-CD3 KD and Higher Bmax in Binding to T and B Cell as Determined by FACSThe K<sub>D </sub>of exemplary heteromultimers, v873 and v875, was assessed by FACS as described as described in Example 4 with data analysis and curve fitting performed in GraphPad Prism.</p>The results of this experiment are shown in FIG. 12 and indicate that both v873 and v875 have a higher anti-CD3 affinity compared to v891.
