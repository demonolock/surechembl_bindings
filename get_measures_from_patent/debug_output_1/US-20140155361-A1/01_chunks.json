    "y in vitro studies utilizing chemical induction of NQO1 in macrophages, which attenuate both oxidative stress and expression of MMP12. The role of MMP12 in human airway disease and COPD has recently been reported. (Hunninghake et al. New Engl. J. Med. 361:2599-2608 (2009)).</p>Therefore, it may be possible to treat COPD by enhancing or activating NQO1.</p>NaphthoquinonesA naphthoquinone is an organic compound C10H6O2. It can be viewed as a derivative of naphthalene with two hydrogen atoms replaced by two ketone moieties. Three common isomers of naphthoquinones are 1,2-naphthoquinone, 1,4-naphthoquinone and 2,6-naphthoquinone.</p>\u03b2-lapachone (3,4-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-2H-naphtho[1,2-b]pyran-5,6-dione), is a 1,2-naphthoquione derived from lapachol, a 1,4-naphthoquinone). \u03b2-lapachone can be isolated from the lapacho tree (Tabebuia avellanedae), a member of the catalpa family (Bignoniaceae). Lapachol and \u03b2-lapachone (with numbering) have the following chemical structures:</p><img id=\"EMI-C00001\" path=\"US20140155361A1-20140605-C00001.TIF\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/267222869/US/20140605/A1/020140/15/53/61/US20140155361A1-20140605-C00001.TIF\"/></p>\u03b2-lapachone, as well as its intermediates, derivatives and analogs thereof, are described in Li et al. (1993) J. Biol. Chem., 268(30): 22463-22468. As a single agent, \u03b2-lapachone has demonstrated significant antineoplastic activity against human cancer cell lines at concentrations typically in the range of 1-10 \u03bcM (IC50). \u03b2-lapachone may induce unscheduled expression of checkpoint molecules. Although its exact intracellular target(s) and mechanism of antineoplastic activity remain unknown, \u03b2-lapachone has also shown potent in vitro inhibition of human DNA Topoisomerases I and II (Li et al. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268: 22463; and Frydman et al. (1997) Cancer Res. 57: 620) with novel mechanisms of action. Unlike topoisomerase \u201cpoisons\u201d (e.g., camptothecin, etoposide, doxorubicin) which stabilize the covalent topoisomerase-DNA complex and induce topoisomerase-mediated DNA cleavage, \u03b2-lapachone interacts either directly with the enzyme to inhibit catalysis and block the formation of cleavable complex (Li et al. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268: 22463) or with the complex itself, causing religation of DNA breaks and dissociation of the enzyme from DNA (Krishnan et al. (2000) Biochem. Pharm., 60: 1367).</p>Another possible intracellular target for \u03b2-lapachone in tumor cells is NQO1. Biochemical studies suggest that reduction of \u03b2-lapachone by NQO1 leads to a \u201cfutile cycling\u201d between the quinone and hydroquinone forms with a concomitant loss of reduced NADH or NAD(P)H (Pink et al. (2000) J. Biol Chem. 275: 5416). The exhaustion of these reduced enzyme cofactors may be a critical factor for the activation of the apoptotic pathway after \u03b2-lapachone treatment.</p>A number of \u03b2-lapachone analogs have been disclosed in the art, such as those described in PCT International Application PCT/US93/07878 (WO94/04"
