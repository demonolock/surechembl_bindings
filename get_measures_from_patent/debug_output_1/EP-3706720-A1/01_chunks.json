Thus, any of described dosages of Factor VIII in terms of nig of drug per capsule or number of capsules taken may be doubled or increased by another amount relative to other decreases in bioavailability. \n\n Embodiments of Therapeutic Compositions Comprising Factor VII </p>[0143] As discussed above, various embodiments of the invention provide therapeutic compositions comprising clotting factors such as Factor VII for the treatment of various clotting disorders such as congenital and acquired hemophilia. Accordingly, a brief explanation will now be presented on Factor VII compounds. Factor VII (described as EC 3.4.21.21, blood- coagulation factor VII, activated blood coagulation Factor Vila formerly known as proconvertin) is one of the proteins that causes blood to clot in the coagulation cascade. Factor VII is used as a replacement therapy in hemophilia patients with factor VII deficiency as well as patient who develop inhibitory antibodies to one or more of the clotting factors including Factor VIII. It has also been used off label to control bleeding in trauma patients and for treatment of cerebral hemorrhage. It is an enzyme of the serine protease class and is produced by liver cells and excreted into the circulation. The excreted glycoprotein is a single- chain of 406 amino-acids with a mass of approximately 50 KD, which is converted to its active form by proteolytic cleavage and other mechanism. Several factors can lead to proteolytic cleavage of Factor VII including factor IXa, factor Xa, factor Xlla or thrombin. After proteolysis of a 38 to 60 amino- acid sequence, FVII is converted to two chains connected by a disulfide bond, which comprises the activated form or FVIIa. The light chain (152 aa) contains domains for epidermal growth factor and insane phospholipids binding and carboxylated glutamic acid residues that bind to calcium ions, while the heavy chain (254aa) contains the serine protease activity that catalyzes the activation of Factor IX and X to their activated forms. </p> [0144] As used herein, the term \"Factor VII\" includes both the uncleaved FVII (zymogen) and activated form of Factor VII known as Factor Vila. Also various embodiments of Factor VII may correspond to polypeptides comprising the 1-406 polypeptide sequence of human wild-type human Factor VII (as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,784,950), or FVII derived from another species (e.g. bovine, porcine, canine, murine). Other forms of FVII contemplated and delivered by embodiments of the invention may include the natural allelic variations of Factor VII that may exist, and any form or degree of glycosylation or other post-translational modification. The term \"Factor VII\" also includes variants of Factor VII which have the same or higher biological activity compared to the activity of the wild form, these particula"
