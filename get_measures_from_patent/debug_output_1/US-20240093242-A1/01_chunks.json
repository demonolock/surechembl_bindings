    "lantation and no evidence of off-target mutations using a high-fidelity Cas9 as a ribonucleoprotein complex. We achieve high levels of targeting frequencies (median 45%) in CD34<sup>+ </sup>HSPCs from six SCID-X1 patients and demonstrate rescue of lymphopoietic defect in a patient derived HSPC population in vitro and In vivo. In sum, our study provides specificity, toxicity and efficacy data supportive of clinical development of genome editing to treat SCID-X1.</p>IntroductionThe present example describes a clinically relevant, selection-free \u201cuniversal\u201d CRISPR-Cas9-rAAV6 GE methodology that could potentially correct &gt;97% of known IL2RG pathogenic mutations. We call this approach \u201cfunctional gene correction\u201d because it is not directly correcting a mutation but instead is doing so by using the targeted integration of cDNA to functionally correct downstream mutations. Approximately 2-3% of patients with deletions of the gene could not be functionally corrected using this strategy. We demonstrate that a functional, codon-optimized IL2RG cDNA can be precisely and efficiently integrated at the endogenous translational start site in CD34<sup>+ </sup>HSPCs of healthy male donors (HD, n=13) or SCID-X1 patients (n=6) at comparable frequencies (median HR=45%) in both peripheral blood (PB)-derived and umbilical cord blood (CB)-derived CD34<sup>+ </sup>HSPCs. We demonstrate the functionality of the full-length codon-optimized IL2RG cDNA by showing that T cells with the cDNA knock-in (KI) retain normal proliferation and signaling response to cytokines. Using transplantation into immunodeficient (NSG) mice, we show that process is both effective (with functional correction of 10-20% of LT-HSCs) and safe (no evidence of abnormal hematopoiesis). The In vivo functional results are based on transplantation of \u02dc21 million IL2RG targeted healthy donor CD34<sup>+ </sup>HSPCs and \u02dc7 million IL2RG targeted SCID-X1-HSPCs. We demonstrate high levels of CD34<sup>+ </sup>LT-HSC targeted cDNA integration (10-20%) by showing multi-lineage hematopoiesis derived from these cells using serial transplantation in immunodeficient mice. These results match and exceed the predicted therapeutic threshold determined through a mouse model (19). Finally, we show no evidence of significant genotoxicity as demonstrated by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and karyotype analysis. Together, this study establishes a pre-clinical proof-of-concept for a safe, precise, and highly efficient GE strategy to potentially cure SCID-X1.</p>ResultsGene Correction Strategy for IL2RG Locus in CD34<sup>+ </sup>HSPCsSCID-X1 is caused by pathogenic mutations spanning the entire IL2RG gene. Therefore, we developed a gene-targeting strategy by integrating a complete cDNA at the endogenous IL2RG translational start site (FIG. 1A, central panel) that would correct the vast majority (18 97%) of known SCID-X1 pathogenic mutations and ensure regulated endogenous expression in CD34<sup>+ </sup>HSPCs derived proge",
    "s expressed through the targeted integration of a codon-optimized cDNA into the translational start site of the endogenous locus, we evaluated the proliferation and signaling activity of HR-GE human T lymphocytes derived from adult healthy male donors. Mature T cells depend on proper IL2RG expression and signaling through IL2RG-containing receptors, e.g., IL-2R, to promote proliferation and differentiation (40). Activation of T cells by CD3/CD28 antibodies leads to a rapid induction of IL-2 cytokine, which in turn signals though the IL-2R. Subsequent phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the cytoplasmic domains of the receptors initiates a cascade of events that phosphorylate and activate the signaling transducers and activators of transcription 5 (STAT5) proteins. Therefore, we assessed the levels of pSTAT5 in IL2RG cDNA targeted T cells, where the IL2RG cDNA donor contained tNGFR selectable marker (FIG. 5A). Intracellular staining for pSTAT5 from IL2RG cDNA targeted T cells (FIG. 5B) and levels of pSTAT5 (ratio of tNGFR<sup>+</sup>pSTAT5<sup>+ </sup>double-positive cells to that of tNGFR<sup>+ </sup>only cells, marked red) was demonstrated to be comparable to that of unmodified normal T cells 69.3\u00b17.0 vs 67.7\u00b14.4 (mean\u00b1s.e.m.), respectively (FIG. 5C). As expected, knocking-out (KO) the IL2RG locus with an IL2RG targeted donor expressing only tNGFR, significantly reduced the levels of pSTAT5 (12.7\u00b15.6; mean\u00b1s.e.m.) (FIG. 5B). We analyzed the MFI of the pSTAT5 level in WT, KI, and KO cells (FIG. 5C) and found that the KO cells had an extremely low pSTAT5 MFI (as expected), whereas the KI cells had pSTAT5 MFI (mean fluorescence intensity) that was \u02dc50% of the wild-type cells. This lower signaling did not compromise lymphocyte development (FIGS. 1-4) nor proliferation (FIG. 5D). The KI cells did not have higher signaling, which has been hypothesized as a risk factor for transformation.</p>To demonstrate that the genome edited IL-2R is permissive for proliferation upon engagement of IL-2 cytokine, we quantified the levels of proliferation of IL2RG cDNA targeted T-cell following T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. A carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) dilution assay was used to measure whether targeted insertion of the codon-optimized cDNA could support T-cell proliferation. Loss of CFSE signal occurs when cells proliferate as the dye dilutes from cell division. An overview of the assay is shown (FIG. 5A). In our experimental settings, we observed similar proliferation profile in tNGFR<sup>+ </sup>T cells (marking cells in which the IL2RG cDNA had been KI) compared with mock-targeted cells (FIG. 5E). We note that the \u201cunmodified\u201d cells had not undergone prior bead stimulation and so remained quiescent while the targeted and mock cells had undergone prior bead stimulation and thus there was residual proliferation without re-stimulation in those cells giving the broader peak. Overall, our data demonstrate that the genomic integration of an IL2RG codon diverged cDNA at the start site of the endogenous locus preserves normal signaling and proliferation of human T cells.</p>Off-Target and Karyotype AnalysisWe investigated the specificity of the dsDNA break generated by the CRISPR-Cas9 RNP complex, which could be a potential source of genotoxicity. The off-target activity of the full-length 20 nt and three truncated versions (19 nt, 18 nt, and 17 nt) of sg-1 guide were assessed at 54 different potential sites predicted by either Guide-Seq in U20S cells 41 or bioinformatically COSMID42 (FIG. 6A). The analysis was performed in both healthy (FIG. 6B) and patient-derived CD34<sup>+ </sup>HSPCs (FIG. 6B) to assess the specificity of the sg-1 gRNA. At the three sites identified by Guide-Seq analysis, there was no evidence of off-target INDELs. In the 51 sites identified by COSMID, only two showed evidence of off-target INDELs, both at levels &lt;1% (FIG. 6A). We detected INDEL frequencies using the 20 nt sg-1 of 0.59%, in an intron of myelin protein zero-like 1(MPZL1), a cell surface receptor gene involved in signal transduction proces"
