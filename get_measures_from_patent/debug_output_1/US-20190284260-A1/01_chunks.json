    "e carriers for the preparation of unit dose forms which can be used for oral administration are well-known in the prior art. Their choice will depend on secondary considerations, such as flavour, cost and storage stability, which are not critical for the purposes of the present invention and can be implemented without difficulties by a person skilled in the art.</p>The pharmaceutical composition according to the invention can furthermore comprise an injection buffer, which preferably improves the transfection and also the translation of the antibody-coding RNA according to the invention in cells or an organism. The pharmaceutical composition according to the invention can comprise, for example, an aqueous injection buffer which contains, with respect to the total pharmaceutical composition, if this is in liquid form, a sodium salt, preferably at least 50 mM sodium salt, a calcium salt, preferably at least 0.01 mM calcium salt, and optionally a potassium salt, preferably at least 3 mM potassium salt. According to a preferred embodiment, the sodium salts, calcium salts and optionally potassium salts contained in such an injection buffer are in the form of halides, e.g. chlorides, iodides or bromides, or in the form of their hydroxides, carbonates, bicarbonates or sulfates. Examples which are to be mentioned here are, for the sodium salt NaCl, NaI, NaBr, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, for the potassium salt optionally present KCl, KI, KBr, K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, KHCO<sub>3</sub>, K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and for the calcium salt CaCl<sub>2</sub>, CaI<sub>2</sub>, CaBr<sub>2</sub>, CaCO<sub>3</sub>, CaSO<sub>4</sub>, Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>. The injection buffer can also contain organic anions of the abovementioned cations. In a particularly preferred embodiment, such an injection buffer contains as salts sodium chloride (NaCl), calcium chloride (CaCl<sub>2</sub>) and optionally potassium chloride (KCl), it also being possible for other anions to be present in addition to the chlorides.</p>These salts are typically present in the injection buffer optionally used in the pharmaceutical composition according to the invention, with respect to the total pharmaceutical composition (if this is in liquid form), in a concentration of at least 50 mM sodium chloride (NaCl), at least 3 mM potassium chloride (KCl) and at least 0.01 mM calcium chloride (CaCl<sub>2</sub>). The injection buffer can be in the form of both hypertonic and isotonic or hypotonic injection buffers. In connection with the present invention, in this context the injection buffer is hypertonic, isotonic or hypotonic with respect to the particular reference medium, i.e. the injection buffer has either a higher, the same or a lower salt content compared with the particular reference medium, such concentrations of the abovementioned salts which do not lead to damage to the cells caused by osmosis or other concentration effects preferably being"
