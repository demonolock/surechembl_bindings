    " vectors would theoretically also be advantageous in that they should replicate and spread throughout the tumor, not just in the initial infected cells as is the case with replication-defective vectors.</p>Wyeth Laboratories developed replication-competent Ad vectors for vaccination purposes, using vaccine strains of Ad serotypes 4, 7, and 5 (Lubeck et al., AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses 10:1443-1449, 1994). Foreign genes were inserted into the E3 region (with the E3 genes deleted) or into a site at the right end of the genome. Two foreign genes used were hepatitis B surface antigen and the HIV envelope protein. They obtained good expression in culture, and were able to raise antisera in animal models. Phase I human trials were ambiguous, and the project was mostly abandoned.</p>Onyx Pharmaceuticals recently reported on adenovirus-based anti-cancer vectors which are replication deficient in non-neoplastic cells but which exhibit a replication phenotype in neoplastic cells lacking functional p53 and/or retinoblastoma (pRB) tumor suppressor proteins (U.S. Pat. No. 5,677,178; Heise et al., Nature Med. 6:639-645, 1997; Bischoff et al., Science 274:373-376, 1996). This phenotype is reportedly accomplished by using recombinant adenoviruses containing a mutation in the E1B region that make the encoded E1B-55K protein incapable of binding to p53 and/or a mutation(s) in the E1A region which make the encoded E1A protein (p289R or p243R) incapable of binding to pRB and/or the cellular 300 kD polypeptide and/or the 107 kD polypeptide. E1B-55K has at least two independent functions: it binds and inactivates the tumor suppressor protein p53, and it is required for efficient transport of Ad mRNA from the nucleus. Because these E1B and E1A viral proteins are involved in forcing cells into S-phase, which is required for replication of adenovirus DNA, and because the p53 and pRB proteins block cell cycle progression, the recombinant adenovirus vectors described by Onyx should replicate in cells defective in p53 and/or pRB, which is the case for many cancer cells, but not in cells with wild-type p53 and/or pRB. Onyx has reported that replication of an adenovirus lacking E1B-55K, which is named ONYX-015, was restricted to p53-minus cancer cell lines (Bischoff et al., supra), and that ONYX-015 slowed the growth or caused regression of a p53-minus human tumor growing in nude mice (Heise et al., supra). Others have challenged the Onyx report claiming that replication of ONYX-015 is independent of p53 genotype and occurs efficiently in some primary cultured human cells (Harada and Berk, J. Virol 73:5333-5344, 1999). ONYX-015 does not replicate as well as wild-type adenovirus because E1B-55K is not available to facilitate viral mRNA transport from the nucleus. Also, ONYX-015 expresses less ADP than wild-type virus (see Example 1 below).</p>As an extension of the ONYX-015 concept, a replication-competent adenovirus vector was designed that has the gene for E1B-55K replaced with the herpes simplex virus t"
