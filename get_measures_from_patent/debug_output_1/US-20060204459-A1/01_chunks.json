    "it, which has at least one mutation proximal to Y823, more particularly between amino acids 800 to 850 of SEQ ID No 1 involved in c-kit autophosphorylation, notably the D816V, D816Y, D816F and D820G mutants, are preferred. </p> Example of cell lines expressing an activated-mutant c-kit are as mentioned. </p> In another preferred embodiment, the method further comprises the step consisting of testing and selecting compounds capable of inhibiting c-kit wild at concentration below 1 \u03bcM. This can be measured in vitro or in vivo. </p> Therefore, compounds are identified and selected according to the method described above are potent, selective and non-toxic c-kit wild inhibitors. </p> Alternatively, the screening method as defined above can be practiced in vitro. In this regard, the inhibition of mutant-activated c-kit and/or c-kit wild can be measured using standard biochemical techniques such as immunoprecipitation and western blot. Preferably, the amount of c-kit phosphorylation is measured. </p> In a still further embodiment, the invention contemplates a method for whitening human skin and treating melanocyte dysfunction associated diseases as depicted above wherein the screening comprises </p> a) performing a proliferation assay with cells expressing a mutant c-kit (for example in the transphosphorylase domain), which mutant is a permanent activated c-kit, with a plurality of test compounds to identify a subset of candidate compounds targeting activated c-kit, each having an IC50&lt;10 \u03bcM, by measuring the extent of cell death, </p> b) performing a proliferation assay with cells expressing c-kit wild said subset of candidate compounds identified in step (a), said cells being IL-3 dependent cells cultured in presence of IL-3, to identify a subset of candidate compounds targeting specifically c-kit, </p> c) performing a proliferation assay with cells expressing c-kit, with the subset of compounds identified in step b) and selecting a subset of candidate compounds targeting c-kit wild, each having an IC50&lt;10 \u03bcM, preferably an IC50&lt;1 \u03bcM, by measuring the extent of cell death. </p> Here, the extent of cell death can be measured by 3H thymidine incorporation, the trypan blue exclusion method or flow cytometry with propidium iodide. These are common techniques routinely practiced in the art. </p> The expression \u201cmelanocyte dysfunction associated diseases\u201d will be understood herein as hypermelanosis resulting from melanocyte dysfunction and including lentigines, solar and senile lentigo, Dubreuilh melanosis, moles as well as melanomas including malignant melanomas. </p> Therefore, the invention embraces the use of the compounds defined above to manufacture a medicament or a cosmetic composition for whitening human skin and treating melanocyte dysfunction associated diseases as defined above. </p> The pharmaceutical or cosmetic compositions utilized in this invention may be administered by any number of routes including oral and topical. </p> In addition to the active ingredients, these pharmaceutical compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries which facilitate processing of the active compounds into preparations which can be used pharmaceutically. Further details on techniques for formulation and administration may be found in the latest edition of Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Maack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa.). </p> Pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration can be formulated using pharmaceutically acceptable carriers"
