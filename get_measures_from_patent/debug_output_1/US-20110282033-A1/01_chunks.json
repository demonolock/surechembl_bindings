The specificity of an antigen-binding protein can be determined based on affinity and/or avidity, as described on pages 53-56 of WO 08/020,079 (incorporated herein by reference), which also describes some preferred techniques for measuring binding between an antigen-binding molecule (such as a Nanobody or polypeptide of the invention) and the pertinent antigen. Typically, antigen-binding proteins (such as the amino acid sequences, Nanobodies and/or polypeptides of the invention) will bind to their antigen with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10<sup>\u22125 </sup>to 10<sup>\u221212 </sup>moles/liter or less, and preferably 10<sup>\u22127 </sup>to 10<sup>\u221212 </sup>moles/liter or less and more preferably 10<sup>\u22128 </sup>to 10<sup>\u221212 </sup>moles/liter (i.e. with an association constant (K<sub>A</sub>) of 10<sup>5 </sup>to 10<sup>12 </sup>liter/moles or more, and preferably 10<sup>7 </sup>to 10<sup>12 </sup>liter/moles or more and more preferably 10<sup>8 </sup>to 10<sup>12 </sup>liter/moles). Any K<sub>D </sub>value greater than 10<sup>4 </sup>mol/liter (or any K<sub>A </sub>value lower than 10<sup>4 </sup>M<sup>\u22121</sup>) liters/mol is generally considered to indicate non-specific binding. Preferably, a monovalent immunoglobulin sequence of the invention will bind to the desired antigen with an affinity less than 500 nM, preferably less than 200 nM, more preferably less than 10 nM, such as less than 500 pM. Specific binding of an antigen-binding protein to an antigen or antigenic determinant can be determined in any suitable manner known per se, including, for example, Scatchard analysis and/or competitive binding assays, such as radioimmunoassays (RIA), enzyme immunoassays (EIA) and sandwich competition assays, and the different variants thereof known per se in the art; as well as the other techniques mentioned herein.\n    As will be clear to the skilled person, and as described on pages 53-56 of WO 08/020,079, the dissociation constant may be the actual or apparent dissociation constant. Methods for determining the dissociation constant will be clear to the skilled person, and for example include the techniques mentioned on pages 53-56 of WO 08/020,079The half-life of an amino acid sequence, compound or polypeptide of the invention can generally be defined as described in paragraph o) on page 57 of WO 08/020,079 and as mentioned therein refers to the time taken for the serum concentration of the amino acid sequence, compound or polypeptide to be reduced by 50%, in vivo, for example due to degradation of the sequence or compound and/or clearance or sequestration of the sequence or compound by natural mechanisms. The in vivo half-life of an amino acid sequence, compound or polypeptide of the invention can be determined in any manner known per se, such as by pharmacokinetic analysis. Suitable techniques will be clear to the person skilled in the art, and may for example generally be as described in paragraph o) on page 57 of WO 08/020,079. As also mentioned in paragraph o) on page 57 of WO 08/020,079, the half-life can be expressed using parameters such as the t1/2-alpha, t1/2-beta and the area under the curve (AUC).

Other amino acid sequences that can be suitably linked to the Nanobodies of the invention so as to provide an effector function will be clear to the skilled person, and may be chosen on the basis of the desired effector function(s). Reference is for example made to WO 04/058820, WO 99/42077, WO 02/056910 and WO 05/017148, as well as the review by Holliger and Hudson, supra; and to the non-prepublished US provisional application by Ablynx N.V. entitled \u201cConstructs comprising single variable domains and an Fc portion derived from IgE\u201d which has a filing date of Dec. 4, 2007. Coupling of a Nanobody of the invention to an Fc portion may also lead to an increased half-life, compared to the corresponding Nanobody of the invention. For some applications, the use of an Fc portion and/or of constant domains (i.e. C<sub>H</sub>2 and/or C<sub>H</sub>3 domains) that confer increased half-life without any biologically significant effector function may also be suitable or even preferred. Other suitable constructs comprising one or more Nanobodies and one or more constant domains with increased half-life in vivo will be clear to the skilled person, and may for example comprise two Nanobodies linked to a C<sub>H</sub>3 domain, optionally via a linker sequence.

Such monomeric (i.e. not self-associating) Fc chain variants, or fragments thereof, will be clear to the skilled person. For example, Helm et al., J Biol Chem 1996 271 7494, describe monomeric Fc\u03b5 chain variants that can be used in the polypeptide chains of the invention.</p>Also, such monomeric Fc chain variants are preferably such that they are still capable of binding to the complement or the relevant Fc receptor(s) (depending on the Fc portion from which they are derived), and/or such that they still have some or all of the effector functions of the Fc portion from which they are derived (or at a reduced level still suitable for the intended use). Alternatively, in such a polypeptide chain of the invention, the monomeric Fc chain may be used to confer increased half-life upon the polypeptide chain, in which case the monomeric Fc chain may also have no or essentially no effector functions.</p>Bivalent/multivalent, bispeci",

In addition, approximately 1 g of lymph node was collected from animal 128 4 days after boost 6.</p>Two llama's (24 and 25) were immunized according to standard protocols with 7 boosts, each of them with of 10<sup>7</sup>-10<sup>8 </sup>A431 cells (human vulvar carcinoma cel",
    "0 days after boost 1.</p>Example 2Library ConstructionPeripheral blood mononuclear cells were prepared from blood samples using Ficoll-Hypaque according to the manufacturer's instructions. Next, total RNA was extracted from these cells and lymph node tissue, if available, and used as starting material for RT-PCR to amplify Nanobody encoding gene fragments. These fragments were cloned into phagemid vector pAX50. Phage was prepared according to standard methods (see for example the prior art and applications filed by applicant cited herein).</p>Example 3Selections of Phage Displaying VEGFR1 Binding NanobodiesPhage libraries 127 and 128 were used for selections on recombinant human sVEGFR1 (Reliatech GmbH Cat #S01-010). sVEGFR1 was immobilized directly on Maxisorp 96 well microtiter plates (Nunc) at 5 ug/ml, 1 ug/ml and 0 ug/ml (control). Following incubation with the phage libraries and extensive washing, bound phage was aspecifically eluted with glycine, pH 2.2, or specifically with 5 ug/ml VEGF<sub>121 </sub>(R&amp;D Systems Cat #298-VS/CF).</p>Individual colonies obtained from the eluted phage pools were grown and i) induced for new phage production and ii) induced with IPTG for Nanobody expression and extraction (periplasmic extracts) according to standard methods (see for example the prior art and applications filed by applicant cited herein).</p>Example 4Screening for Binding to VEGFR1In order to determine binding specificity to VEGFR1, the clones were tested in an ELISA binding assay setup, using the monoclonal phage pools. Phage binding to sVEGFR1 (Reliatech GmbH Cat # S01-010) and dimeric VEGFR1/Fc chimera (R&amp;D Systems Cat #321-FL), was tested. Shortly, 0.1 ug/ml receptor was immobilized on Maxisorp ELISA plates (Nunc) and free binding sites were blocked using 4% Marvel skimmed milk in PBS. Next, 10 ul of supernatant from the monoclonal phage inductions of the different clones in 100 ul 2% Marvel PBST were allowed to bind to the immobilized antigen. After incubation and a wash step, phage binding was revealed using a HRP-conjugated monoclonal-anti-M13 antibody (Gentaur Cat#27942101). Binding specificity was determined based on OD values compared to controls having received no phage.</p>FIGS. 1A and 1B shows a selection of clones binding to sVEGFR1 and/or VEGFR1-Fc chimera, respectively.</p>Example 5Screening for VEGFR1 Blocking NanobodiesClones tested positive in the VEGFR1 binding assay were screened for their ability to block VEGF binding to the dimeric VEGFR1-Fc chimera. For this, Nanobody containing periplasmic extracts, or selected purified Nanobodies, were used in an ELISA-based ligand competition setup. In short, 0.2 ug/ml human VEGF<sub>165 </sub>(R&amp;D Systems #293-VE) was coated in 96 well Maxisorp microtiter plates (Nunc) and blocked with 4% Marvel skimmed milk in PBS. In parallel, 0.1 ug/ml VEGFR1-Fc chimera was incubated with periplasmic extracts or purified Nanobody. After 1 hour, the receptor-Nanobody pre-mixes were incubated 1 hour with the coated ligand. Bound VEGFR1-Fc was detected using HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, Cat #109-035-098). Blocking activity was determined as loss of OD signal, as compared to wells where no Nanobodies, or irrelevant Nb, had been added. A control is included where VEGFR1-Fc is directly coated at 0.1 ug/ml, which serves to verify that loss of signal is not caused by competition for binding of the detecting HRP-anti-hIgG to the Fc-part of VEGFR1.</p>The results are shown in FIG. 2, which shows the competition assay of selected purified Nanobodies (Nb) at 100 nM concentration. As can be seen from FIG. 2, 46F11 efficiently inhibits binding of VEGFR1-Fc to VEGF, 42H5 does not inhibit binding, and 43B3 is a negative control that does not bind VEGFR1. As a control for anti-Fc competition (not shown), VEGFR1-Fc was directly coated at 0.1 ug/ml, otherwise the assay was performe",
    "re-mixes were incubated 1 hour with the coated ligand. Bound VEGFR1-Fc was detected using HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, Cat #109-035-098). The results are shown in FIG. 3. As can be seen, 46-F11 is a VEGFR1 binding and blocking clone, whereas 42-H5 is a VEGFR1 binding and non-blocking clone. A sequence alignment of these clones is given in FIG. 9.</p>Example 7Selections of Phage Displaying PDGFR\u03b2 Binding NanobodiesPhage libraries 127 and 128 were used for selections on recombinant human PDGFR\u03b2-Fc chimera (R&amp;D Systems Cat #385 PR). PDGFR\u03b2-Fc was immobilized directly on Maxisorp 96 well microtiter plates (Nunc) at 1 ug/ml and 0 ug/ml (control). To minimize the number of phage binding to the Fc-portion of PDGFR\u03b2-Fc, the phage was pre-incubated with 250 ug/ml Human IgG. Following incubation with the phage libraries and extensive washing, bound phage was eluted with glycine, pH 2.2. The eluted phage were amplified and applied in a second round of selection on 0.1 ug/ml and 0 ug/ml (control) immobilized PDGFR\u03b2-Fc. Individual colonies obtained from the eluted phage pools were grown and i) induced for new phage production and ii) induced with IPTG for Nanobody expression and extraction (periplasmic extracts) according to standard methods (see for example the prior art and applications filed by applicant cited herein).</p>Example 8Screening for Binding to PDGFR\u03b2In order to determine binding specificity to PDGFR\u03b2-Fc, the clones were tested in an ELISA binding assay setup, using the monoclonal phage pools. Shortly, 1 ug/ml of Fc-capturing Ab (Rabbit anti-human IgG, DAKO # A423) was coated on Maxisorp ELISA plates (Nunc) and free binding sites were blocked using 4% Marvel skimmed milk in PBS. Next, 0.1 ug/ml receptor in 2% Marvel/PBS was captured. After a wash step with PBS, 10 ul of supernatant from the monoclonal phage inductions of the different clones in 100 ul 2% Marvel PBS were allowed to bind to the captured PDGFRP-Fc. After incubation and a wash step, phage binding was revealed using a HRP-conjugated monoclonal-anti-M13 antibody (Gentaur Cat#27942101). Binding specificity was determined based on OD values compared to controls having received no phage. FIG. 4 shows a selection of clones binding to the PDGFR\u03b2-Fc chimera.</p>Example 9Screening for PDGFR\u03b2 Blocking NanobodiesClones tested in the PDGFR\u03b2 binding assay were also screened for their ability to block PDGF-BB binding to PDGFR\u03b2-Fc. For this, Nanobody containing periplasmic extracts, or selected purified Nanobodies, were used in an ELISA-based ligand competition setup. In short, 1.0 ug/ml (80 nM) recombinant human PDGF-BB (R&amp;D Systems #220-BB) was coated in 96 well Maxisorp microtiter plates (Nunc) and blocked with 4% Marvel skimmed milk in PBS. In parallel, 1 ug/ml (12 nM) PDGFR\u03b2-Fc chimera was incubated with periplasmic extracts or purified Nanobody. After 1 hour, the receptor-Nanobody pre-mixes were incubated 1 hour with the coated ligand. Bound PDGFR\u03b2-Fc was detected using HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, Cat #109-035-098). Blocking activity was determined as loss of OD signal, as compared to wells where no Nanobodies, or irrelevant Nb, had been added.</p>As can be seen from FIG. 5, 53-H8, -A5, -G3, -B5 and -G10 inhibits binding of PDGFR\u03b2-Fc to PDGF-BB, 53-A2 and -A3 do not inhibit binding to the ligand. 42-H5 is a VEGFR1-binder used here as a negative control that does not bind PDGFR\u03b2. A sequence alignment of these clones is given in FIG. 10.</p>Example 10Determining Competition Efficiency by Titration of Purified NanobodyIn order to determine the receptor blocking efficiency of clones tested positive for PDGF-BB competition, a dilution series of purified Nanobodies were tested in the ELISA-based ligand competition setup. In short, 1.0 ug/ml (80 nM) recombinant human PDGF-BB (R&am",
    "on with the phage libraries and extensive washing, bound phage was eluted with glycine, pH 2.2. Individual colonies obtained from the eluted phage pools were grown in Masterplate 55 and i) induced for new phage production and ii) induced with IPTG for Nanobody expression and extraction (periplasmic extracts) according to standard methods (see for example the prior art and applications filed by applicant cited herein).</p>For selections with phages from the pool libraries, a first round selection was performed by directly immobilization on Maxisorp 96 well microtiter plates (Nunc) of cocktail 082 containing 2.5 \u03bcg/ml of FGFR4-Fc (see cocktail description above). The eluted phage were amplified and applied in a second round of selection on 5 ug/ml and 0 ug/ml (control) immobilized FGFR4-Fc. In both selection rounds the input phages were pre-incubated with 250 ug/ml Human IgG in order to minimize the number of phage binding to the Fc-portion of FGFR4-Fc. Following incubation with the phage libraries and extensive washing, bound phage was eluted with TEA, pH 12. Individual colonies obtained from the eluted phage second round pools were grown in Masterplate 73 and induced with IPTG for Nanobody expression and extraction (periplasmic extracts) according to standard methods (see for example the prior art and applications filed by applicant cited herein).</p>Example 12Screening for Binding to FGFR4In order to determine binding specificity to FGFR4, the clones were tested in an ELISA binding assay setup, using the monoclonal penis. Shortly, 500 ng/ml of Fc-FGFR4 (R&amp;D Systems Cat #685 FR) was coated on Maxisorp ELISA plates (Nunc) and free binding sites were blocked using 4% Marvel skimmed milk in PBS. After a wash step with PBS, 10 ul of periplasmic extract from the monoclonal inductions of the different clones in 100 ul 2% Marvel PBS were allowed to bind to the FGFR4-Fc. After incubation and a wash step, periplasmatic extract binding was revealed using anti mouse IgG (Fc specific)-alkaline phosphatase antibody (SIGMA Cat N A2429-1 mL). FIG. 7 shows a selection of clones binding to Fc-FGFR4. 53-G3 was used as a reference since it was selected against PDGFR\u03b2-Fc.</p>Example 13Screening for FGFR4 Blocking Nanobodies and Determining Competition Efficiency by Titration of Purified NanobodyClones tested in the FGFR4 binding assay were also screened for their ability to block acidic FGF binding to FGFR4-Fc. For this, purified Nanobodies, were used in an ELISA-based ligand competition setup. In short, 2.0 ug/ml (129 nM) human FGF (R&amp;D Systems Cat #232-FA/CF) was coated in 96 well Maxisorp microtiter plates (Nunc) and blocked with 4% Marvel skimmed milk in PBS. In parallel, 0.25 ug/ml (1.9 nM) FGFR4-Fc chimera plus 2.5 \u03bcg/ml heparin and 10 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>were incubated with periplasmic extracts or purified Nanobody. After 1 hour, the receptor-Nanobody pre-mixes were incubated 1 hour with the coated ligand. Bound FGFR4-Fc was detected using HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, Cat #109-035-098). Blocking activity was determined as loss of OD signal, as compared to wells where irrelevant Nanobody had been added. The results are shown in FIG. 8. 53-G3 is a PDGFR\u03b2-binder used here as a negative control that does not bind FGFR4. Ligand is coated at 129 nM and receptor is added at 3.8 nM.</p>As can be seen from the above data, clones 55-D5, 73-G9, 73-A9 and 73-E6 are ligand competitors. Clones 73-H1, 73-A7 and 55-B8 are non-competing binders. A sequence alignment of these clones is given in FIG. 11.</p>Example 13Detecting Binding of Anti-PDFGR Nanobodies with Immunofluorescence on Hela Cells2 days before the experiment cells were seeded in a 12-well plate containing coverslips.</p>Medium was changed to serum depleted medium (for starvation) with hepes medium withou"
