    "rmation of a clot or seal is desired.</p>EXAMPLE 15 Sealants with a Fibrinolytic Inhibitor</p>Each of the procedures of Example 10-14 are repeated with the difference that Thrombin-Assisted Fibrinolytic Inhibitor (TAFI) is also electrospun from the solution that contains the fibrinogen. Each of the procedures of Example 10-14 are then repeated except that TAFI is electrospun along with collagen from the solution that contains the collagen. Each of the procedures of Example 10-14 are then repeated except that TAFI is applied to the electrospun matrix by electrospraying. Each of the procedures of Example 10-14 are then repeated except that the TAFI is applied to the matrix by aerosol spraying one or more solutions containing TAFI upon each matrix or by immersing each matrix into solutions containing TAFI. The resulting matrices are applied to sites at which formation of a clot or seal is desired.</p>EXAMPLE 16</p>Electrospinning a Blend of Collagen and Thrombin</p>Approximately 100 NIH units of bovine thrombin (Sigma Chemical Co.) was dissolved in 0.1 mL 10X MEM Earle's (without L-glutamine and sodium bicarbonate).</p>About 0.9 mL of HFP (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co.) was added in addition to 0.08 g bovine collagen. The material was mixed until dissolved and loaded into a 1.0 ml syringe. \n\nAn 18-gauge stub (blunted) needle was then placed on the syringe to act as the electrospinning nozzle and charging point for the contained collagen solution. The filled syringe was placed on a KD Scientific syringe pump using a Becton-Dickinson 1.0 ml Plunger set to dispense the solution at a rate of 1.85 ml/hr. The positive lead from the high voltage supply was attached to the metal stub of the syringe. The syringe pump was turned on and the high voltage supply was set at 22 kV. The grounded target was a 303 stainless steel mandrel (0.1 cm W x 0.6 cm H x 2 cm L) placed five inches from the tip of the needle. The mandrel was rotated at approximately 3500 \u03c6m. The collagen-thrombin solution was electrospun to form a white mat on the grounded mandrel.</p>EXAMPLE 17 Application of Thrombin to Electrospun Collagen</p>An electrospun collagen matrix was made by electroprocessing a solution having a concentration of 0.08 g/ml bovine Type I collagen in HFP. The collagen suspension or solution was placed into a syringe. The filled syringe was placed on a KD Scientific syringe pump using a Becton-Dickinson 1.0 ml Plunger. The positive lead from the high voltage supply was attached to the metal stub of the syringe. The syringe pump was turned on and the high voltage supply was set at approximately 23 kV. The target was a stainless steel mandrel disposed about 6 inches from the end of the needle. The target was rotated at approximately 3500 \u03c6m and was rectangular. The faces upon which the electroprocessed materials was spun were about 1 x 3 inches in diameter. Approximately 2 mL of solution was spun. The electroprocessed material was removed from the mandrel and part of one face of electroprocessed material (a portion about 1 x 1.5 inches in size) was taken for further processing. The portion of the electrospun matrix was placed into a petri dish. Approximately</p>40 NIH units of Bovine thrombin (Sigma Chemical Co.) were suspended in water and applied to the mat using an airbrush. The thrombin suspension was sprayed onto the collagen mat until the mat had a saturated appearance. The mat was then left in a pool of the thrombin suspension in the petri dish. The electroprocessed material was allowed to dry overnight at 4\u00b0C. The electroprocessed material was then placed into about 0.04 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and sti\u03c0ed at room temperature for a period of 15 minutes. The collagen mat was then pelleted by centrifugation and the PBS-thrombin solution was withdrawn. Thrombin activity within the PBS was confirmed by a spec",
    "d-line incision was made in the abdominal wall, and the liver or spleen was exposed. Wounds on the liver were made using a razor blade to shave \n\na large, shallow area from the liver. Injuries to the spleen were made by transection of the spleen with scissors. In both cases, the electroprocessed collagen material was applied after the injury with forceps directly to the wound surface. For some liver injuries, the wound was larger than the electroprocessed material, so additional pieces of the collagen mat were applied to cover the wound completely. Bleeding time was measured by visual inspection of the wound for blood flow. For both types of wounds, the collagen mat stopped bleeding completely in less than five seconds after application. No oozing or seeping from the wounds was observed.</p>EXAMPLE 21</p>Physical Properties of Matrix Electrospun from Fibrinogen Solution</p>Lyophilized, bovine fibrinogen, Fraction I from plasma (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical</p>Co.). was suspended in a solution composed of 9 parts HFP (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical</p>Co.) and 1 part 10X minimal essential medium (MEM), Earle's (without L-glutamine and sodium bicarbonate) at a concentration of 0.167 grams/ml HFP/MEM. Once in solution or suspension, 2.5 ml of the fibrinogen solution was loaded into a 3.0 ml syringe. An 18- gauge stub (blunted) needle was then placed on the syringe to act as the electrospinning nozzle and charging point for the contained fibrinogen solution. The filled syringe was placed on a KD Scientific syringe pump using a Becton-Dickinson 1.0 ml Plunger set to dispense the solution at a rate of 1.85 ml/hr. The positive lead from the high voltage supply was attached to the metal stub of the syringe. The syringe pump was turned on and the high voltage supply was set at 22 kV. The grounded target was a 303 stainless steel mandrel (13.8 cm h x 13.8 cm 1 x 0.5 cm w ) placed four inches from the tip of the needle. The mandrel was rotated at approximately 3500 \u03c6m. The fibrinogen solution was electrospun to form a white mat on the grounded mandrel. After electrospinning (0.4 ml total volume), the mat was removed from the mandrel and processed for scanning (SEM) and transmission (TEM) electron microscopy evaluation.</p>Uniaxial material testing was performed on a MTS Bionix 200 mechanical testing system inco\u03c6orating a 100N load cell with an extension rate of 10.0 mm minute to failure (MTS Systems Co\u03c6.; Eden Prairie, MN). The specimens were cut out of the mats using a \"dog-bone\" shaped template to assure uniformity and to isolate the failure point away from the grips. Tests were performed on dry and wet samples. Dry samples were tested in essentially the state they were found after electrospinning. Wet samples were soaked for approximately three hours in phosphate buffered saline. The specimens had a width of 2.75 mm and a gage length of 11.25 mm. The material properties chosen for comparison were the Young's modulus(tangential method), ultimate tensile strength (Peak "
