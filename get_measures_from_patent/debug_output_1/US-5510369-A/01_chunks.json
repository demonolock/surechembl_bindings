    "um and potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium and magnesium salts, salts with organic bases such as dicyclohexylamine salts, N-methyl-D-glucamine, and salts with amino acids such as arginine, lysine, and so forth. Also, the basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quatemized with such agents as lower alkyl halides, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chloride, bromides and iodides; dialkyl sulfates like dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl; and diamyl sulfates, long chain halides such as decyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides, aralkyl halides like benzyl and phenethyl bromides and others.</p>Amide couplings used to form the compounds of this invention are typically performed by the carbodiimide method with reagents such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, or 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl) carbodiimide. Other methods of forming the amide or peptide bond include, but are not limited to the synthetic routes via an acid chloride, azide, mixed anhydride or activated ester. Typically, solution phase amide coupling are performed, but solid-phase synthesis by classical Merrifield techniques may be employed instead. The addition and removal of one or more protecting groups is also typical practice.</p>The compounds shown in the tables below are exemplary compounds of the present invention:</p>                                  TABLE 1\n__________________________________________________________________________\n ##STR6##\nR.sub.1      R.sub.2       Ki vs Thrombin (nM)\n__________________________________________________________________________\nPhCH.sub.2   H             680\nC.sub.6 H.sub.11 CH.sub.2\n             H             150\n3,4-Cl.sub.2PhCH.sub.2\n             NH.sub.2      1.5\nPhCH.sub.2   NH.sub.2      3.4\n ##STR7##                  47\n3,4-Cl.sub.2PhCH.sub.2\n             CH.sub.3 NH   2.9\n ##STR8##                  152\nPhCH.sub.2   CH.sub.3 SO.sub.2 NH\n                           17\n3,4-Cl.sub.2PhCH.sub.2\n             H             414\n__________________________________________________________________________\n ##STR9##\nR.sub.2      R.sub.1       Ki (nM) vs thrombin\n__________________________________________________________________________\nH            H             &gt;10000\nCH.sub.3 NH\n              ##STR10##    2.3\nNH.sub.2\n              ##STR11##    27\nNH.sub.2\n              ##STR12##    30\nOH\n              ##STR13##    63\nAcNH\n              ##STR14##    170\nBocNH\n              ##STR15##    9.4\nCbzNH\n              ##STR16##    3.7\n ##STR17##\n              ##STR18##    15\nBocNH\n              ##STR19##    6.8\nBocNH\n              ##STR20##    12\nBocNH\n              ##STR21##    50\nBocNH        CH.sub.2 OtBu 6\nCbzNH        CH.sub.2tBu   2.3\nCbzNH\n              ##STR22##    16\nBocNH\n              ##STR23##    8.0\nCF.sub.3 CH.sub.2 SO.sub.2 NH\n              ##STR24##    3.0\nPhCH.sub.2 CH.sub.2 NH\n              ##STR25##    4.0\nBocNH\n              ##STR26##    200\n__________________________________________________________________________\n</pre></p>              TABLE 2\n______________________________________\n ##STR27##\n______________________________________\n                       Ki\nG                      (nM vs thrombin)\n______________________________________\n ##STR28##             0.12\n ##STR29##             2.0\n ##STR30##             0.4\n ##STR31##             0.0025\n ##STR32##             0.4\n ##STR33##             1.3\n ##STR34##             0.102\n ##STR35##             0.05\n ##STR36##             0.1\n______________________________________\nG                      Ki (nM)\n______________________________________\n ##STR37##             1.5\n ##STR38##             55\n ##STR39##             3\n______________________________________\n</pre></p>The following synthetic routes can be used to prepare compounds of the invention. Using method I (as exemplified by example 1 ), trans-4-t-butoxycarbonylamino-cyclohexyl-methaneamine (1-3 ) is coupled to a protected dipeptide such as N-methyl-D-phenylalanyl-L-proline using standard amide coupling procedures. The BOC protecting groups can then be removed using a strong acid such as HCl gas. ##STR40##</p>A second method for constructing the compounds of general structure I (as exemplified by example 18) is to react trans-4-benzyloxycarbonylamino-cyclohexyl-methaneamine with a protected amino acid such as Boc-L-proline. The Amino acid group is removed and the freed amine is then coupled with the suitable carboxylic acid. The CBZ group is then removed using reducing conditions. ##STR41##</p>A third preferred method (as exemplified by example 5) is to couple the protected Boc-amino-cyclohexylmethanamine-L-proline with the desired acid followed by removal of the Boc protecting group to give the requisite compound. ##STR42##</p>For example, this method can be used to prepare ##STR43## as shown in Example 1.</p>EXAMPLE 1Preparation of trans-4-Aminocyclohexylmethyl N-Methyl-D-phenylalanyl-L-proline amide ##STR44##Step 1Preparation of N-(trans-4-Carboxycyclohexylmethyl)phthalimide</p>N-carboethoxyphthalimide (21.9 "
