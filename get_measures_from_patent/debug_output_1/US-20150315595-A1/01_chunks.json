As illustrated in both FIGS. 1A and 1B, the 20 oligonucleotides demonstrated a robust knock-down of the MUT reporter construct with a marked dose response relative to the endogenous WT reporter.</p>FIGS. 2A and 2B illustrate the expression of the expanded ATXN3 transcript (MUT) and the endogenous ATXN3 (WT) mRNA in the ATXN3-Q81 transfected HEK-293 cells following gymnotic delivery of twelve selected oligonucleotides. The results were normalized to the endogenous GAPDH levels and expressed as a percent of the mock treated samples. The oligonucleotides were introduced to the cells by gymnosis using media having final concentrations of 0.3 \u03bcM, 1 \u03bcM, 3 \u03bcM, 9 \u03bcM, 27 \u03bcM and 81 \u03bcM. The cells were then harvested 48 hours after gymnotic delivery of the oligonucleotides, and the mRNA of the mutated ATXN3 transcript (reporter construct) and the endogenous ATXN3 transcript were extracted and analyzed by qPCR. The results are reported as the average of three independent studies per oligonucleotide and the error bars indicate the standard deviation. As illustrated in FIGS. 2A and 2B, all twelve oligonucleotides evaluated were found to produce a dose-dependent knock-down of the MUT reporter construct in the concentration ranges evaluated relative to the WT reporter construct.</p>FIG. 3 illustrates the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) curves for the five oligonucleotides that were selected as leads and designed to be complementary to portions of the region of the expanded ATXN3 allele that includes the G987C single nucleotide polymorphism located one nucleotide from the pathogenic (CAG)<sub>n </sub>expansion of the ATXN3 mRNA. HEK-293 cells were stably transfected with a pFLAG-ATX3Q81-FL-FFLuciferase reporter construct that comprised the coding region of the mutated ATXN3 transcript having the G987C SNP and 81 (CAG) repeats fused to a firefly luciferase transcript and the oligonucleotides were subsequently introduced into the transfected cells by gymnosis using media having final concentrations of 0.3 \u03bcM, 3 \u03bcM, 9 \u03bcM, 27 \u03bcM and 81 \u03bcM. The cells were then harvested 48 hours after gymnotic delivery of the oligonucleotides, and the mRNA of the mutated ATXN3 transcript (reporter construct) and the endogenous ATXN3 transcript were extracted and analyzed by qPCR. The plotted data points represent the average reporter signal of three independent experiments and the error bars represent the standard deviation. The grey curve (\u2666) represents the fitted response curve of the wild-type (WT) reporter and the black curve (\u25b4) represents the fitted response curve of the expanded or mutant (MUT) reporter. The corresponding IC<sub>50 </sub>value for each curve is indicated on each graph and the actual values for the five selected lead oligonucleotides are also reported ",
    "h the previously-described reporter construct (pFLAG-ATXN3Q81-FL-FFLuciferase).</p>The oligonucleotides were introduced to the cells by gymnosis using media having final concentrations of 0.3 \u03bcM, 1 \u03bcM, 3 \u03bcM, 9 \u03bcM, 27 \u03bcM and 81 \u03bcM. The cells were subsequently harvested 48 hours after the addition of oligonucleotides and the mRNA of the mutated ATXN3 transcript (reporter construct) and the endogenous ATXN3 transcript were extracted and analyzed by qPCR. FIGS. 2A and 2B illustrate the expression of the mutated ATXN3 transcript (MUT) and the endogenous ATXN3 (WT) mRNA in the ATXN3-Q81 transfected cells following gymnotic delivery of the selected oligonucleotides. The results were normalized to the endogenous GAPDH levels and expressed as a percent of the mock treated samples. The studies were repeated three times and the values were plotted in Graphpad Prism against a sigmoidal response curve using non-linear regression.</p>From the regression, an estimate of the IC<sub>50 </sub>value in the reporter assay was determined. The IC<sub>50 </sub>curves are shown in FIG. 3 and the corresponding IC<sub>50 </sub>values are tabulated in Table 2 below. The selectivity of the twelve oligonucleotides calculated was calculated as the fold difference of the IC<sub>50 </sub>value against the mutated ATXN3 (MUT) versus endogenous ATXN3 (WT) transcripts and the IC<sub>50 </sub>values for the five oligonucleotides selected as leads are shown in Table 2 below.</p>TABLE 2Selectivity (IC50IC50 (MUT,IC50 (WT,WT/MUT) GymnosisSH No.Gymnosis) \u03bcMGymnosis) \u03bcM(fold)SH062.011.45.7SH104.59.82.2SH132.58.63.4SH163.49.22.7SH204.826.55.5</p>With regard to the selectively of the selected oligonucleotides for the mutant/expanded ATXN3 reporter relative to the wild-type ATXN3 transcript, nine out of the twelve selected oligonucleotides demonstrated a better than approximately 3-fold selectivity for the mutant/expanded reporter over the wild-type transcript.</p>Example 3Melting Temperature for Twelve Oligonucleotides Annealed to Wild-Type or Mutant ATXN3As part of the characterization of the twelve oligonucleotide candidates described in Example 2 above, the melting temperature (T<sub>m</sub>) of each oligonucleotide from a complementary mutant target RNA (designated cMUT) was evaluated. Each of the twelve oligonucleotides was also tested against an RNA representing the wild-type allele (designated cWT), which included a single complementarity mismatch against the G987C SNP located one nucleotide from the (CAG) expansion.</p>The T<sub>m </sub>values for each of the twelve oligonucleotides were determined, and the change in T<sub>m </sub>(\u0394T<sub>m</sub>) represents the average of the melting and annealing temperature for each oligonucleotide. The T<sub>m </sub>data representing the five selected lead oligonucleotides are presented in Table 3, where the \u0394Tm was defined as the difference between the cMUT (perfect complement) and cWT (one complementary mismatch at mutation site) values.</p>"
