(2003, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 100:4445-50) performed a bioinformatic analysis of the AD sequence of various AKAP proteins to design an RII selective AD sequence called AKAP-IS (SEQ ID NO:3), with a binding constant for DDD of 0.4 nM. The AKAP-IS sequence was designed as a peptide antagonist of AKAP binding to PKA. </p>Residues in the AKAP-IS sequence where substitutions tended to decrease binding to DDD are underlined in SEQ ID NO:3 below. The skilled artisan will realize that in designing sequence variants of the AD sequence, one would desirably avoid changing any of the underlined residues, while conservative amino acid substitutions might be made for residues that are less critical for DDD binding. Table 3 shows potential conservative amino acid substitutions in the sequence of AKAP-IS (AD1, SEQ ID NO: 3), similar to that shown for DDD1 (SEQ ID NO: l) in Table 2 above. </p> [0134] A limited number of such potential alternative AD moiety sequences are shown in SEQ ID NO:32 to SEQ ID NO:49 below. Again, a very large number of species within the genus of possible AD moiety sequences could be made, tested and used by the skilled artisan, based on the data of Alto et al. (2003). It is noted that Figure 2 of Alto (2003) shows an even large number of potential amino acid substitutions that may be made, while retaining binding activity to DDD moieties, based on actual binding experiments. </p>AKAP-IS </p>QIEYLAKQIVDNAIQQA (SEQ ID NO:3) \n\n Table 3.

    "es based on milatuzumab rely more heavily on the antibody's direct interaction with the tumor cell, taking advantage of CD74's rapid internalization and re-expression that can compensate for its lower abundance on the surface of cells. However, this advantage would be mitigated when CD74 is highly scattered within the tumor, and without a mechanism to retain the conjugate within the tumor, the benefit of the drug's slow release from the conjugate would be lost. A previous review of human gastrointestinal tumors by our group suggests that they often have a high level of expression with good uniformity (Gold et al., 2010, Int J Clin Exp Pathol 4: 1-12). </p>[0345] During our initial assessment of suitable linkers for SN-38, a number of different derivatives were examined, including a 'CL2E'-like linker that was designed to be coupled at the 20-hydroxyl position of SN-38, similar to the CL2A linker. However, that antibody conjugate lacked sufficient antitumor activity and was not pursued. Given the exceptional internalization properties of milatuzumab, we decided to revisit the SN-38-linker chemistry, with the hypothesis that the rapid internalization of a CD74 conjugate would enhance drug loading of a more stable conjugate. We surmised that if the leaving group was phenolic, this could promote cyclization, and therefore, the CL2E-linker was designed to join at the phenolic 10-position of SN-38. </p> [0346] At the onset, the CL2E-Iinked SN-38 conjugate had a promisingly similar IC50 as the CL2A conjugate in the Raji cell line, which was consistent with the view that if rapidly internalized, both conjugates would release the active form of SN-38 at approximately the same rate. However, as already mentioned, the in vitro activity of the CL2A conjugate is influenced largely by the release of SN-38 into the media, and does not necessarily reflect uptake by the intact conjugate. When the CL2E-linked conjugate was found to be much less potent in the solid tumor cell lines than the CL2A conjugate, this suggested that the lower surface expression of CD74 affected the internalization of SN-38 via milatuzumab binding. However, when in vivo studies in Raji showed the milatuzumab-CL2A-SN-38 was superior to the CL2E conjugate, some other factor had to be considered that would affect CL2E's \n\n efficacy. One possible explanation is that the linker design in CL2E-SN-38 leaves the 20- position of the drug underivatized, rendering the lactone group susceptible to ring-opening. Indeed, studies with irinotecan have shown SN-38's potency is diminished by a number of factors, with the lactone ring opening to the carboxylate form possessing only 10% of the potency of the intact lactone form. In contrast, the CL2A-linked SN-38 is derivatized at the 20-hydroxyl position, a process that stabilizes the lactone group in camptothecins under physiological conditions. Therefore, SN-38 's lactone ring is likely protected from cleavage in the CL2A, but not the CL2E conjugate. Thus,"
