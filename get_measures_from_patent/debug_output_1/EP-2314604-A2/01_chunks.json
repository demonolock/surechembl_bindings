    "ectively. Indicated are the locations of the signal peptide (black box), the wall-spanning region (WSR; boxes with vertical bars), the cell wall anchor motif (LPKTG), and the membrane-spanning region (MSR; boxes with diagonal bars).</p>The number of individual repeats is indicated for each protein. Grey boxes represent a repeat with the sequence motif 'GNVLERRQRDAENRSQ', boxes with horizontal bars represent repeats with an R14K substitution and dotted boxes show the location of repeats with both an A11V and R14K substitution. Repeats that carry an E12D substitution are indicated below the FbsA proteins from GBS strains 33H1A and SS1169. Above FbsA from 33H1A, a repeat carrying a single A11V substitution is indicated.</p>Fig. 9 shows a Western blot analysis of truncated FbsA derivatives to identify the fibrinogen-binding domain in FbsA. Hexahistidyl-tagged fusion proteins, representing the mature FbsA protein (FbsA-19), the N-terminal repeat-containing region (FbsA-N) or the C-terminal part (FbsA-C) of FbsA were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose and tested for their binding to human fibrinogen. The fibrinogen binding activity of the three proteins encoded by different constructs are indicated below the schematic FbsA drawing.</p>Fig. 10 shows the competitive inhibition of fibrinogen binding to GBS 6313 by the purified fusion proteins FbsA-19, FbsA-9 and Bsp, respectively. FbsA-9 differs from FbsA-19 in that it contains only 9 repeats in its repeat domain. The binding assay was performed with <sup>125</sup>I-labelled fibrinogen in the presence of different concentrations of each fusion protein. Each experiment was performed at least in triplicate.</p>Fig. 11 shows a spot membrane analysis of fibrinogen binding by synthetic peptides derived from the repeat unit of FbsA. Fibrinogen binding was tested with peptides carrying the FbsA repeat motif 'GNVLERRQRDAENRSQ' (SEQ ID 113) and with peptides containing the scrambled sequence 'GLSQNRDVRENQRARE'. (SEQ ID 205) Synthetic peptides, which differed from the repeat motif in that single amino acids had been replaced by alanine, were probed for fibrinogen binding. Beside the spot membrane, the sequence of each synthetic peptide is listed. Bold and underlined letters indicate amino acid substitutions within the repeat motif.</p>Fig. 12 shows a spot membrane analysis of the fibrinogen binding repeat unit. Synthetic peptides were tested for fibrinogen binding, in which each of the amino acids of the fibrinogen-binding repeat was replaced by each of the 20 amino acids. The vertical letters, printed in bold, represent the FbsA-derived fibrinogen binding sequence 'GNVLERRQRDAENRSQ'. The horizontal letters represent those amino acids that were introduced in the synthetic peptides instead of the original amino acid in the respective position.</p>Fig. 13 shows the competitive inhibition of fibrinogen binding to GBS 6313 by synthetic peptides. The binding assay was performed with <sup>125</sup>I-labelled fibrinogen in the presence of different concentrations of the peptides pep_FbsA (SEQ ID 211), carrying an FbsA-derived repeat unit, and pep_R6A, possessing an R6A substitution within the repeat unit. Each experiment was performed at least in triplicate.</p>Fig. 14 shows eukaryotic cell adherence (A) and invasion (B) of GBS strains 6313, 706 S2, and O90R and their respective fbsA deletion mutants. The values represent the result of at least four independent experiments performed in triplicate. Error bars are indicated.</p>Fig. 15. shows a peptide ELISA of FbsA peptides with human sera. The 5 biotinylated peptides (wild type &lt;1&gt;: GNVLERRQRDAENRSQ SEQ ID No. 113; alanine mutant peptides: GAVLERRQRDAENRSQ SEQ ID No. 207, &lt;3&gt; GNALERRQRDAENRSQ SEQ ID No. 208, &lt;4&gt; GNVLEARQRDAENRSQ SEQ ID No. 211, &lt;5&gt; GNVLERAQRDAENRSQ SEQ ID No. 212; see also Fig.11) were coated on Streptavidin-coated ELISA plates and analysed using 5 sera from patients infected with GBS. The patient sera were applied in a dilution of 1:200 and 1:1,000. IgG (A) and IgA (B) antibodies were detected with secondary anti-human antibodies coupled to Horse Radish Peroxidase and ABTS as substrate.</p>Fig. 16 shows the DNA sequence of the pabA/B-encoding region and the deduced PabA (nt 319-2964) and PabB (nt3087-5111) proteins from GBS 6313. Putative ribosomal binding sites (RBS) are underlined. Letters in bold and italics indicate the putative"
