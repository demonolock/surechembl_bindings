    "nding fragments thereof, exhibit anti-IL-6 activity by binding to IL-6 which may be soluble IL-6 or cell surface expressed IL-6 and/or may prevent or inhibit the binding of IL-6 to IL-6R and/or activation (dimerization) of the gp130 signal-transducing glycoprotein and the formation of IL-6/IL-6R/gp130 multimers and the biological effects of any of the foregoing. The subject IL-6 antibodies may possess different antagonistic activities based on where (i.e., epitope) the particular antibody binds IL-6 and/or how it affects the formation of the foregoing IL-6 complexes and/or multimers and the biological effects thereof. Consequently, different IL-6 antibodies according to the invention e.g., may be better suited for preventing or treating conditions involving the formation and accumulation of substantial soluble IL-6 such as rheumatoid arthritis whereas other antibodies may be favored in treatments wherein the prevention of IL-6/IL-6R/gp130 or IL-6/IL-6R/gp130 multimers is a desired therapeutic outcome. This can be determined in binding and other assays.</p>The anti-IL-6 activity of the anti-IL-6 antibody of the present invention, and fragments thereof having binding specificity to IL-6, may also be described by their strength of binding or their affinity for IL-6. This also may affect their therapeutic properties. In one embodiment of the invention, the anti-IL-6 antibodies of the present invention, and fragments thereof having binding specificity to IL-6, bind to IL-6 with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of less than or equal to 5\u00d710<sup>\u22127</sup>, 10<sup>\u22127</sup>, 5\u00d710<sup>\u22128</sup>, 10<sup>\u22128</sup>, 5\u00d710<sup>\u22129</sup>, 10<sup>\u22129</sup>, 5\u00d710<sup>\u221210</sup>, 10<sup>\u221210</sup>, 5\u00d710<sup>\u221211</sup>, 10<sup>\u221211</sup>, 5\u00d710<sup>\u221212</sup>, 10<sup>\u221212</sup>, 5\u00d710<sup>\u221213</sup>, 10<sup>\u221213</sup>, 5\u00d710<sup>\u221214</sup>, 10<sup>\u221214</sup>, 5\u00d710<sup>\u221215 </sup>or 10<sup>\u221215</sup>.

Non-limiting examples of diseases and disorders associated with IL-6 are set forth infra. As noted cancer-related fatigue, cachexia and rheumatoid arthritis are preferred indications for the subject IL-6 antibodies.</p>In another embodiment of the invention, the anti-IL-6 antibodies described herein, or IL-6 binding fragments thereof, do not have binding specificity for IL-6R or the gp-130 signal-transducing glycoprotein.</p>B-Cell Screen",
    "antibody is preferably selected after an enrichment step and a culture step that results in a clonal population of antigen-specific B cells. The methods can further comprise a step of sequencing a selected antibody or portions thereof from one or more isolated, antigen-specific cells. Any method known in the art for sequencing can be employed and can include sequencing the heavy chain, light chain, variable region(s), and/or complementarity determining region(s) (CDR).</p>In addition to the enrichment step, the method for antibody selection can also include one or more steps of screening a cell population for antigen recognition and/or antibody functionality. For example, the desired antibodies may have specific structural features, such as binding to a particular epitope or mimicry of a particular structure; antagonist or agonist activity; or neutralizing activity, e.g., inhibiting binding between the antigen and a ligand. In one embodiment, the antibody functionality screen is ligand-dependent. Screening for antibody functionality includes, but is not limited to, an in vitro protein-protein interaction assay that recreates the natural interaction of the antigen ligand with recombinant receptor protein; and a cell-based response that is ligand dependent and easily monitored (e.g., proliferation response). In one embodiment, the method for antibody selection includes a step of screening the cell population for antibody functionality by measuring the inhibitory concentration (IC50). In one embodiment, at least one of the isolated, antigen-specific cells produces an antibody having an IC50 of less than about 100, 50, 30, 25, 10 \u03bcg/mL, or increments therein.</p>In addition to the enrichment step, the method for antibody selection can also include one or more steps of screening a cell population for antibody binding strength. Antibody binding strength can be measured by any method known in the art (e.g., Biacore). In one embodiment, at least one of the isolated, antigen-specific cells produces an antibody having a high antigen affinity, e.g., a dissociation constant (Kd) of less than about 5\u00d710<sup>\u221210 </sup>M-1, preferably about 1\u00d710<sup>\u221213 </sup>to 5\u00d710<sup>\u221210</sup>, 1\u00d710<sup>\u221212 </sup>to 1\u00d710<sup>\u221210</sup>, 1\u00d710<sup>\u221212 </sup>to 7.5\u00d710<sup>\u221211</sup>, 1\u00d710<sup>\u221211 </sup>to 2\u00d710<sup>\u221211</sup>, about 1.5\u00d710<sup>\u221211 </sup>or less, or increments therein. In this embodiment, the antibodies are said to be affinity mature. In a preferred embodiment, the affinity of the antibodies is comparable to or higher than the affinity of any one of Panorex\u00ae (edrecolomab), Rituxan\u00ae (rituximab), Herceptin\u00ae (traztuzumab), Mylotarg\u00ae (gentuzumab), Campath\u00ae (alemtuzumab), Zevalin\u2122 (ibritumomab), Erbitux\u2122 (cetuximab), Avastin\u2122 (bevicizumab), Raptiva\u2122 (efalizumab), Remicade\u00ae (infliximab), Humira\u2122 (adalimumab), and Xolair\u2122 (omalizumab). Preferably, the affinity of the antibodies is comparable to or higher than the affinity of Humira\u2122. The affinity of an antibody can also be increased by known affinity maturation techniques. In one embodiment, at least one cell population is screened for at least one of, preferably both, antibody functionality and antibody binding strength.</p>In addition to the enrichment step, the method for antibody selection can also include one or more steps of screening a cell population for antibody sequence homology, especially human homology. In one embodiment, at least one of the isolated, antigen-specific cells produces an antibody that has a homology to a human antibody of about 50% to about 100%, or increments therein, or greater than about 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95% homologous. The antibodies can be humanized to increase the homology to a human sequence by techniques known in the art such as CDR grafting or selectivity determining residue grafting (SDR).</p>In another embodiment, the present invention also provides the antibodies themselves according to any of the embodiments described above in terms of IC50, Kd, and/or homology.</p>The B cell selection protocol disclosed herein has a number of intrinsic advantages versus other methods for obtaining antibody-secreting B cells and monoclonal antibodies specific to desired target antigens. These advantages include, but are not restricted to, the following:</p>First, it has been found that when these selection procedures are utilized with a desired antigen such as IL-6 or TNF-\u03b1, the methods reproducibly result in antigen-specific B cells capable of generating what appears to be a substantially comprehensive complement of antibodies, i.e., antibodies that bind to the various different epitopes of the antigen. Without being bound by theory, it is hypothesized that the comprehensive complement is attributable to the antigen enrichment step that is performed prior to initial B cell recovery. Moreover, this advantage allows for the isolation and selection of antibodies with different properties as these properties may vary depending on the epitopic specificity of the particular antibody.</p>Second, it has been found that the B cell selection protocol reproducibly yields a clonal B cell culture containing a single B cell, or its progeny, secreting a single monoclonal antibody that generally binds to the desired antigen with a relatively high binding affinity, i.e. picomolar or better antigen binding affinities. By contrast, prior antibody selection methods tend to yield relatively few high affinity antibodies and therefore require extensiv",
    ". Amplicons from each well are analyzed for recovery and size integrity. The resulting fragments are then digested with AluI to fingerprint the sequence clonality. Identical sequences display a common fragmentation pattern in their electrophoretic analysis. Significantly, this common fragmentation pattern which proves cell clonality is generally observed even in the wells originally plated up to 1000 cells/well. The original heavy and light chain amplicon fragments are then restriction enzyme digested with HindIII and XhoI or HindIII and BsiWI to prepare the respective pieces of DNA for cloning. The resulting digestions are then ligated into an expression vector and transformed into bacteria for plasmid propagation and production. Colonies are selected for sequence characterization.</p>Example 6Recombinant Production of Monoclonal Antibody of Desired Antigen Specificity and/or Functional PropertiesCorrect full-length antibody sequences for each well containing a single monoclonal antibody is established and miniprep DNA is prepared using Qiagen solid-phase methodology. This DNA is then used to transfect mammalian cells to produce recombinant full-length antibody. Crude antibody product is tested for antigen recognition and functional properties to confirm the original characteristics are found in the recombinant antibody protein. Where appropriate, large-scale transient mammalian transfections are completed, and antibody is purified through Protein A affinity chromatography. Kd is assessed using standard methods (e.g., Biacore) as well as IC50 in a potency assay.</p>Example 7Preparation of Antibodies that Bind Human IL-6By using the antibody selection protocol described herein, one can generate an extensive panel of antibodies. The antibodies have high affinity towards IL-6 (single to double digit pM Kd) and demonstrate potent antagonism of IL-6 in multiple cell-based screening systems (T1165 and HepG2). Furthermore, the collection of antibodies display distinct modes of antagonism toward IL-6-driven processes.</p>Immunization Strategy</p>Rabbits were immunized with huIL-6 (R&amp;R). Immunization consisted of a first subcutaneous (sc) injection of 100 \u03bcg in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) (Sigma) followed by two boosts, two weeks apart, of 50 \u03bcg each in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) (Sigma). Animals were bled on day 55, and serum titers were determined by ELISA (antigen recognition) and by non-radioactive proliferation assay (Promega) using the T1165 cell line.</p>Antibody Selection Titer Assessment</p>Antigen recognition was determined by coating Immulon 4 plates (Thermo) with 1 \u03bcg/ml of huIL-6 (50 \u03bcl/well) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Hyclone) overnight at 4\u00b0 C. On the day of the assay, plates were washed 3 times with PBS/Tween 20 (PBST tablets, Calbiochem). Plates were then blocked with 200 \u03bcl/well of 0.5% fish skin gelatin (FSG, Sigma) in PBS for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. Blocking solution was removed, and plates were blotted. Serum samples were made (bleeds and pre-bleeds) at a starting dilution of 1:100 (all dilutions were made in FSG 501/well) followed by 1:10 dilutions across the plate (column 12 was left blank for background control). Plates were incubated for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. Plates were washed 3 times with PBS/Tween 20. Goat anti-rabbit FC-HRP (Pierc",

In addition, each well contained 50K cells/well of irradiated EL-4.B5 cells (5,000 Rads) and an appropriate level of T cell supernatant (ranging from 1-5% depending on preparation) in high glucose modified RPMI medium at a final volume of 2501/well. Cultures were incubated for 5 to 7 days at 37\u00b0 C. in 4% CO2.</p>Identification of Selective Antibody Secreting B Cells</p>Cultures were tested for antigen recognition and functional activity between days 5 and 7.</p>Antigen Recognition Screening</p>The ELISA format used is as described above except 50 \u03bcl of supernatant from the B cell cultures (BCC) wells (all 30 plates) was used as the source of the antibody. The conditioned medium was transferred to antigen-coated plates. After positive wells were identified, the supernatant was removed and transferred to a 96-well master plate(s). The original culture plates were then frozen by removing all the supernatant except 40 \u03bcl/well and adding 60 \u03bcl/well of 16% DMSO in FBS. Plates were wrapped in paper towels to slow freezing and placed at \u221270\u00b0 C.</p>Functional Activity Screening</p>Master plates were then screened for functional activity in the Ti 165 proliferation assay as described before, except row B was media only for background control, row C was media+IL-6 for positive proliferation control, and rows D-G and columns 2-11 were the wells from the BCC (50 \u03bcl/well, single points). 40 \u03bcl of IL-6 was added to all wells except the media row at 2.5 times the EC50 concentration determined for the assay. After 1 h incubation, the Ab/Ag complex was transferred to a tissue culture (TC) treated, 96-well, flat-bottom plate. 20 \u03bcl of cell suspension in modified RPMI medium without huIL-6 (T1165 at 20,000 cells/well) was added to all wells (100 \u03bcl final volume per well). Background was subtracted, and observed OD values were transformed into % of inhibition.</p>B Cell Recovery</p>Plates containing wells of interest were removed from \u221270\u00b0 C., and the cells from each well were recovered with 5-200 \u03bcl washes of medium/well. The washes were pooled in a 1.5 ml sterile centrifuge tube, and cells were pelleted for 2 minutes at 1500 rpm.</p>The tube was inverted, the spin repeated, and the supernatant carefully removed. Cells were resuspended in 100 \u03bcl/tube of medium. 100 \u03bcl biotinylated IL-6 coated streptavidin M280 dynabeads (Invitrogen) and 16 \u03bcl of goat anti-rabbit H&amp;L IgG-FITC diluted 1:100 in medium was added to the cell suspension.</p>20 \u03bcl of cell/beads/FITC suspension was removed, and 5 \u03bcl droplets were prepared on a glass slide (Corning) previously treated with Sigmacote (Sigma), 35 to 40 droplets/slide. An impermeable barrier of parafin oil (JT Baker) was added to submerge the droplets, and the slide was incubated for 90 minutes at 37\u00b0 C., 4% CO2 in the dark.</p>Specific B cells that produce antibody can be identified by the fluorescent ring around them due to antibody secretion, recognition of the bead-associated biotinylated ant"
