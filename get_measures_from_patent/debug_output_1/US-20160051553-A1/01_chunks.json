    "y with test item 3HX at the dose levels of 500 and 1000 mg/kg respectively. Group G5 was treated topically with test item D and E, in combination, at the concentration of 1 \u03bcg and 100 \u03bcg respectively. Group G6 was treated orally with test item D at 1 mg/kg. After 30 min. of D administration, test item E was dosed orally at 100 mg/kg. Group G7 served as both TPA control (right ear) and solvent control (left ear) and was treated orally with Na-CMC. 20 \u03bcL of TPA solution containing 2 \u03bcg of TPA in vehicle (2% DMSO and 98% methanol) was applied topically on both ventral and dorsal side of the right ear of all the groups of animals on day 0, 2, 4, 7 and 9. However, the left ear of Group G7 animals was treated topically with 20 \u03bcL of solvent (2% Dimethylsulfoxide+98% methanol) on day 0, 2, 4, 7 and 9.</p>All the test item formulations was administered orally to Groups-G3, G4, and G6 at the dose volume of 10 ml/kg from day 0 to day 9. For topical application, 20 \u03bcL of test items (3HX and D+E) was dissolved appropriately in the TPA solvent i.e. methanol and applied daily from Day 0 to Day 9 to Groups-G1, G2 and G5.</p>The ear thickness was measured daily using digital caliper. On Day 10, animal's blood was withdrawn by retro-orbital plexus. Blood serum was separated for the estimation of nitric oxide level by Griess method. Further, all the animals were humanely sacrificed and ear punch biopsies were collected, weighed and subjected for histopathological analysis, immunohistochemical Ki-67 staining and Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity.</p>TABLE 2Allocation of AnimalsNo. ofGroupsTreatmentVolume &amp; DoseRouteAnimalsG1TPA + 3HX20 \u03bcL + 20 \u03bcL of 1:4Topical6G2TPA + 3HX20 \u03bcL + 20 \u03bcL of 1:8Topical6G3TPA + 3HX20 \u03bcL + 500 mg/kgOral6G4TPA + 3HX20 \u03bcL + 1000 mg/kgOral6G5TPA + D&amp;E20 \u03bcL + 20 \u03bcL of stockTopical6(1 \u03bcg D + 100 \u03bcg E)G6TPA + D&amp;E20 \u03bcL + 1 mg/kg DOral6and 100 mg/kg EG7TPA Control20 \u03bcL TPA +Oral60.25% Na-CMC</p>Observations/CalculationsBody WeightBody weight of all the animals was recorded from day 0 to day 10.
