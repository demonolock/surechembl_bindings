Data are expressed as fold change in phagocytosis compared to isotype control.</p>Detailed Description</p>In the introduction:</p>the humanized anti-hPD antibody (HKLD) of the present invention has all the following advantages:</p>it has a high humanization percentage, in particular a T20 humanization score of 91.07% and 88.7% for the heavy and light chains, respectively. In contrast, the T20 humanization scores for the heavy and light chains of the anti-PD 1 antibody, designated Keytruda, as a clinically approved antibody and standard were 75.7% and 82.7%, respectively (see table 9). The T20 humanization score is a commonly used parameter in the field of antibody humanization and was first revealed by Gao et al (BMC Biotechnol,2013,13,55). T20 humanization scores are commonly used in patent applications to define humanized antibodies (e.g., WO15161311, WO17127664, WO18136626, WO18190719, WO19060750, or WO 19170677).</p>Surprisingly, it exhibits high producibility and high yield when produced in mammalian cells (e.g. COS, CHO) compared to chimeric antibodies. In fact, the yields were increased 3-4 fold in CHO cells and in COS cells compared to the chimeric antibodies (see Table 11) and 2 fold in Keytruda (see FIG. 6).</p>It presents less than 10 for human PD-1 <sup>-8</sup> Binding affinity (KD) of M. As assessed by different methods, the humanized antibodies of the invention show improved binding to PD-1 compared to the chimeric antibody. The affinity of the humanized antibody HKLD was comparable to one of the anti-PD 1 antibodies designated Keytruda (see table 7).</p>It has antagonist activity and inhibits the binding of human PD-L1 and/or PD-L2 to human PD-1 (see table 13). More particularly, the humanized antibodies of the invention showed improved binding to PD1 expressing cells (fig. 1C) and antagonist ability (see tables 14 and 15) when compared to the chimeric antibody.</p>It is highly stable (see table 12).</p>It blocks PD-1 signaling (SHP-1 phosphorylation and recruitment, see table 15 and fig. 7) and promotes T cell activation (NFAT-mediated activation, see table 16 and fig. 8).</p>It stimulates the secretion of effector cytokines, more particularly IFNg cytokines, by human T cells (figure 9).</p>It is therefore capable of restoring T cell activation.</p>It promotes an anti-tumor immune response in vivo. Indeed, the humanized antibodies of the invention were able to shrink tumor size and increase survival of several types of tumors (fig. 10-12).</p>It has a surprising additional advantage, since it is able to enhance phagocytosis of PD-L1 negative tumor cells by blocking PDL1/PD-1 binding on macrophages (fig. 14). This effect is characteristic of the humanized anti-PD-1 antibodies of the present invention and has not been observed in other anti-PD-1 an",
    "\"N-linked\" or \"O-linked\".</p>\"N-linked\" glycosylation refers to the attachment of a carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X-threonine (where X is any amino acid except proline) are recognition sequences for enzymatically attaching a carbohydrate moiety to an asparagine side chain. Thus, the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site.</p>\"O-linked\" glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or threonine, but 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used. Addition or deletion of N-linked glycosylation sites to an antibody can be achieved by altering the amino acid sequence such that one or more of the above-described tripeptide sequences are created or removed. The addition or deletion of an O-linked glycosylation site can be achieved by adding, deleting or substituting one or more serine or threonine residues in or to the antibody sequence (as the case may be).</p>The invention also relates to a humanized anti-PD-1 antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof:</p>-it has a T20 humanization score of greater than 85%;</p>it exhibits high manufacturability when produced in mammalian cells;</p>it exhibits high yield in mammalian cells;</p>it has a value equal to or lower than 10 for human PD-1 <sup>-7</sup> Binding affinity (KD) of M;</p>-it has antagonist activity and inhibits binding of human PD-L1 and/or PD-L2 to human PD-1 (preferably PD-L1 and PD-L2);</p>it blocks or inhibits PD-1 signaling (SHP-1 phosphorylation and recruitment);</p>it enhances T cell activation, in particular (inhibition of pSHP-1 and TCR-mediated NFAT activation), IFN \u03b3 and IL-2 secretion; and/or</p>It promotes an anti-tumor immune response.</p>It demonstrates good pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in vivo.</p>For the purposes of the present invention, \"humanization\" refers to quantification of humanization of monoclonal antibody variable regions using a T20 scoring analyzer as described in Gao S H, huang K, tu H, adler a s.bmc biotechnology.2013: 13.</p>A web-based tool was provided and the T20 score for the antibody sequences was calculated using the T20 cutoff value human database http:// abanalyzer.

The blastp protein-protein BLAST algorithm was used to compare full-length sequences or only the framework sequences (CDR residues removed) to each sequence in the corresponding antibody database.

In particular, such humanized anti-hPD antibodies have yields in CHO cells of greater than 5mg/L, 6mg/L, 7mg/L, 8mg/L, or 9mg/L, preferably greater than 1g/L or 2 g/L. Alternatively or additionally, such humanized anti-hPD antibodies have a yield in CHO cells of more than 2mg/L, 3mg/L or 4mg/L, preferably more than 4 mg/L.</p>In another embodiment, the yield of such humanized anti-hPD antibody is at least two times the yield of the corresponding chimeric antibody.</p>The affinity of an antibody can be a measure of its binding to a particular antigen at a single antigen-antibody site, and is essentially a combination of attractive and repulsive forces present in the interaction between the antigen binding site of an antibody and a particular epitope. The affinity of an antibody for a particular antigen (e.g., PD-1) can be represented by the equilibrium dissociation constant K, which is expressed by the equation Kd = [ Ag =][Ab]/[Ag Ab]Definitions, which represent the affinity of the antibody combining site; wherein [ Ag]Is the concentration (M) of free antigen, [ Ab ]]Is the concentration (M) of free antibody and [ Ag Ab]Is the concentration (M) of the antigen-antibody complex. In case the antigen and the antibody react strongly together, there is hardly any free antigen or free antibody, and thus the equilibrium constant or affinity of the antibody will be low. The average affinity of the antibody is equal to or lower than 10 <sup>-7</sup> And M. In certain aspects, the humanized anti-PD-1 antibody is equal to or less than 10 <sup>-8</sup> M, preferably equal to or lower than 10 <sup>-9</sup> Affinity of M binds to human PD-1. In one aspect, the affinity is equal to or lower than 1.5x 10 <sup>-</sup><sup>9</sup> And M. Affinity can be measured by any method available to those skilled in the art, for example, by biosensor analysis, such as Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Biacore analysis, blitz analysis, and Scatchard curves. More specifically, binding affinity was measured by Biacore as detailed in example 2. The humanized antibodies of the invention have better affinity than chimeric antibodies.</p>The binding affinity may be represented by K <sub>D</sub> Or dissociation constant, and increased binding affinity with K <sub>D</sub> The decrease corresponds to. One method of determining the binding affinity of an antibody to PD-1 is by measuring the binding affinity of the Fab fragment of the antibody. To obtain Fab fragments, antibodies can be cleaved using papain or expressed recombinantly. Affinity of anti-PD-1 Fab fragments of antibodies can be measured by surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore 3000) <sup>TM</sup> Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) system, BIAcore, INC, piscaway n.j.).

In particular, the humanized anti-hPD-1 antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof as defined above is an antagonist of human PD-L1 and/or PD-L2 binding to human PD-1, preferably human PD-L1 and PD-L2 binding to human PD-1.</p>In some examples, the anti-PD-1 antibodies described herein inhibit the PD-1 signaling pathway by at least 20%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 90%, at least 100%, or at least 2-fold, at least 5-fold, at least 10-fold, at least 20-fold, at least 50-fold, at least 100-fold, or at least 1000-fold. In particular, the humanized anti-hPD-1 antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof is capable of reducing or inhibiting the binding of PD-L1 and/or PD-L2 to PD-1 by at least 50%, 60%, 70%, preferably 80%, more preferably 90% or most preferably 100% as compared to a negative control assay in a binding assay such as a competition ELISA assay. Such assays are described in Sebaugh JL. Guidelines for acid EC50/IC50 evaluation. Pharm. Stat.2011;10, 128-134 and disclosed in example 3. The humanized antibodies of the invention have an IC50 of less than 50ng/ml, particularly less than 40ng/ml and optionally less than 20ng/ml as measured by this assay. In contrast, chimeric antibodies have an IC50 greater than 50ng/ml, i.e., about 60 ng/ml. Alternatively, the ability of the humanized antibodies of the invention to antagonize the binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 can also be measured by Blitz and Biacore competition assays for PD-1 with PD-L1, as detailed in example 4.</p>Methods for determining antibody specificity and affinity by competitive inhibition are well known in the art (see, e.g., harlow et al, antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, cold Spring Harbor, NY (1998); colligan et al, current Protocols in Immunology, green Publishing Association, NY (1992 1993); muller, meth.enzyme.92: 589-601 (1983)) and are described in the examples below.</p>Methods for determining antagonist activity of antibodies are well known in the art and are, for example, ELISA, biosensor assays such as Biacore and Blitz.</p>Nucleic acid molecule encoding anti-PD 1 antibody, recombinant expression vector and host cell</p>Also disclosed herein are nucleic acids encoding the humanized anti-PD-1 antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof described herein, any light or heavy chain thereof, vectors (such as expression vectors), or recombinant viruses comprising these nucleic acids, and host cells comprising the nucleic acids and/or vectors.</p>Nucleic acid sequences</p>The invention also relates to a nucleic acid molecule or group of nucleic acid molecules encoding a humanized anti-hPD-1 antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof as defined above or any light ",

To remove this glycosylation site, the G29 amino acid was replaced with a T amino acid, resulting in an \"LD\" chain (amino acid position determined by Kabat numbering, which corresponds to G34 in SEQ ID NO: 37). HCLD antibodies are good candidates, but a deamination site (DS sequence) is present in the CDR3 region of the heavy chain. This sequence can compromise product stability during production.

Fig. 1 (a) and table 5 show that by different methods, the antibody HKLD has the best binding activity in the variant antibody and the binding is improved compared to the chimeric antibody. Figure 1B demonstrates this similar binding capacity on human cells when the antibody is combined with an LC light chain variant. The avidity measurements in table 6 indicate that HKLD has the best KD in the variant antibody and an improved KD compared to the chimeric antibody. Table 7 compares the affinity measurements of chimeric, HKLD and other PD1 antibodies (such as Keytruda (a clinically approved anti-PD-1 antibody)) to PD1, in this experiment, in contrast to the Blitz experiment using immobilized PD-1 and soluble antibody, measurement of the affinity of an antibody by immobilising an anti-Fc antibody allows affinity measurements to be made for one valency of the PD-1 antibody although the affinity of an anti-PD-1 variant antibody depicts similar affinity/avidity for the PD-1 protein, however, in cell-based systems, the inventors have surprisingly observed that HKLD binds better to PD-1+T cells than the chimeric form of the antibody, as shown in figure 1C and table 8, on the other hand, in addition to the HGLD, the inventors also found that some mutations induced a loss of PD1 binding capacity during humanization, figure 2 (from a to E) shows that the amino acids numbered 96 and 97 by the Kabat method on the heavy chain variable domain and the amino acids numbered 28, 34, 94 on the light chain variable domain are critical for PD1 binding capacity and therefore should not be mutated, table 9 shows the degree of humanization (T20 humanization score) for each selected heavy and light chain variable domain, T20 assay indicates that each variable region of the selected variant antibody has a very strong humanization score, in particular from 88% to 91.28% table 10 shows that the T20 score of humanized anti-PD-1",
    "ere produced in mammalian cells such as CHO or COS, and the results shown in table 11 surprisingly show that the yield (mg/L) of humanized anti-PD 1 variant antibody was better than chimeric antibody in both cell types. HKLD shows the best yield. In CHO cells, the production of this antibody increased 3-fold, and in COS cells, increased almost 4-fold. At the same time, the stability of the molecule was evaluated in vitro, as shown in table 12, all variants showed good stability at 4 \u2103 and 37 \u2103 with low degree of aggregation. Those results indicate that the humanized anti-PD 1 antibody of the present invention shows excellent manufacturability, which is very important for the subsequent steps of clinical development and therapeutic application.</p>In a second experiment using the CHO cell production method, the yield of the HKLD variant was compared to that of Keytruda and chimeric anti-PD-1 antibodies. As shown in fig. 6, the inventors observed that HKLD variants improved yield compared to the chimeric and Keytruda backbones. In this assay, yields were tested on a small scale (12-well plates, transient transfection on adherent cells) and in a bioreactor (non-optimized fed-batch CHO cell production).

In this assay, jurkat T cells stably express a chimeric PD-1 receptor fused to a \u03b2 -gal fragment (ED) and engineered SHP1 fused to a complementary \u03b2 -gal fragment (EA). Co-culture of Jurkat cells with PD-L1 presenting cells resulted in PD-1 phosphorylation, recruitment of engineered SHP-1, and complementation of ED and EA fragments, producing active \u03b2 -gal enzymes and bioluminescent signals upon addition of substrate. Chemiluminescence is directly proportional to PD-1 signal activation. The experiments were performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, PD-1+ Jurkat cells were incubated with different concentrations of anti-PD-1 antibody for 1 hour, then incubated with PD-L1+ cells for an additional hour. The detection reagent is added and the luminescence signal is read 180 minutes after the use of a TecanTM microplate reader. Humanized anti-PD 1 variant antibodies were detected at different concentrations. Data are expressed in RLU (relative luminescence signal). IC50 (ng/mL) refers to the concentration required for signal inhibition to reach 50%.</p></p>Table 15: antagonist ability of PD-1 antibodies to block PD-1-mediated inhibitory signaling: the IC50 (ng/mL) was determined, which refers to the concentration required for signal inhibition to reach 50%, from FIG. 7A.</p>Example 5: cell activation assays using Promega cell-based bioassays</p>The ability of the anti-PD-1 antibody to restore T cell activation was tested using the Promega PD-1/PD-L1 kit (reference J1250). Two cell lines were used: (1) Effector T cells (Jurkat, which stably expresses PD-1, NFAT-induced luciferase) and (2) activating target cells (CHO K1 cells, which stably expresses PDL1 and surface proteins designed to stimulate a homologous TCR in an antigen-independent manner). When the cells are co-cultured, the PD-L1/PD-1 interaction inhibits TCR-mediated activation, thereby blocking NFAT activation and luciferase activity. The addition of anti-PD-1 antibodies can block PD-1 mediated inhibitory signals, leading to NFAT activation and luciferase synthesis and the emission of bioluminescent signals. The experiments were performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Serial dilutions of PD-1 antibody were tested. 4 hours after co-culturing of PD-L1+ target cells, PD-1 effector cells and anti-PD 1 antibody, bioGloTM fluorescein substrate was added to the wells and the plates were read using a TecanTM luminometer. The luminescence quantified using the luminometer reflects T cell activation. Serial dilutions of humanized anti-PD 1 variant antibodies were tested. ED50 (ug/mL) refers to the concentration of antibody required to achieve 50% of the maximum luminescence.</p></p>Table 16: anti-PD-1 antibodies enhance T cell activation in vitro: the ED50 (\u03bc g/mL) was determined, which refers to the concentration of antibody required to achieve 50% of the maximum luminescence, from fig. 8.</p>As a result: after measuring the binding capacity of different humanized anti-PD 1 variant antibodies to PD1, the inhibitory capacity of each variant antibody to block the PD1-PDL1 interaction was assessed using different methods (Biacore, blitz and ELISA). Figure 4A shows the inhibitory response of variant HCLC, HCLD and HELC, HELD antibodies compared to the inhibition of the PD1-PDL1 interaction by the chimeric antibody. Figure 4B shows inhibitory responses of variant HCLD, HELD, HGLD, HILD, HJLD, HKLD, and HLLD antibodies to PDL1 binding to PD 1. Table 13 shows that the presence of all variant antibodies inhibited the binding of PDL1 to PD 1. The results obtained with HCLC and HELC were similar to those shown in table 13 (data not shown). Figure 4C shows the competition effect of the humanized anti-PD 1 antibody at different concentrations, thus determining the IC50 of each variant (figure 4C and table 14). PD1 is capable of binding to another ligand expressed on the cell surface: PDL2. FIGS. 5A and 5B show that anti-PD-1 variant antibodies HELC, HELD and HKLD also block the PD1-PDL2 interaction as measured by the Biacore assay and the antagonist PD-L2/PD-1 ELISA.</p>To confirm these results, bioassays to assess the phosphorylation of SHP1, a signaling protein from the PD-1 pathway, were performed. Fig. 7A and 7B show inhibitory dose responses of different humanized anti-PD variant antibodies to SHP1 phosphorylation. Table 15 shows the IC50 of each variant antibody, showing similar inhibitory efficiency for all variants of PD1 activation. However, the two variants named HCLD and HKLD variants were more effective in inhibiting the signal P-SHP1 than, for example, the HELD variant. Inhibition curves show that HCLD and HKLD close to the chimeric backbone have better inhibition, while HLLD or HJLD humanized variants lose some antagonist ability. Meanwhile, T cell activation was assessed using NFAT bioluminescence bioassay to compare the inhibitory efficiency of inhibition of PD1-PDL1 interaction by all selected humanized anti-PD 1 variant antibodies leading to T cell activation (inhibition of inhibitory checkpoint interaction). Figure 8 shows that all variants tested were able to activate TCR-mediated NFAT signaling, but with different potency and efficacy. The maximum RLU signal obtained during the plateau phase reflects the efficacy. The inventors observed that HCLD, HKLD variants have better potency, e.g., as compared to HELD or HLLD variants. The efficacy was determined by EC50 (table 16). Chimeric antibodies and all variants were effective in activating NFAT, while HCLD, HILD, HKLD, HHLD, HELD, and HKLD variants were most effective in activating T cells.</p>Example 6: IFNg secretion by human T cells</p>To demonstrate the efficacy of the HKLD variants in stimulating effector cytokine secretion by human T cells, the inventors performed a mixed leukocyte reaction assay by co-culturing dendritic cells and allogeneic T cells. As shown in figure 9, the HKLD variants increased secretion of IFNg cytokines in a dose-dependent manner.</p>All selected humanized anti-PD 1 variant antibodies were able to inhibit binding of PD1 to PDL1 and PDL2 in a manner at least as good as the chimeric antibody. All variants were able to activate T cells. In bioassays, like inhibition of P-SHP1 or activation of NFAT by PD1 signaling, the inventors observed that three variants were more potent than the others, i.e., HCLD, HKLD, and HILD. It shows similar signals to the chimerization results and improved PD1 blocking compared to the other variants. The HILD and HKLD variants exhibit optimal properties, as compared to other variants, as well as high producibility and yield in mammalian cell-based production systems, while maintaining their biological activity: high affinity for PD-1, antagonist ability to PD-L1 and PD-L2, and ability to restore T cell activation (inhibition of pSH-P-1, activation of NFAT, promotion of IFNg effector cytokine secretion).</p>Example 7: in vivo",
    "that two receptors PD-1/PD-L1 are required for the humanized anti-PD 1 antibody mediated enhancement of action. These data indicate that anti-PD-1 humanized antibodies neutralize PD-1/PD-L1 interactions on M1 macrophages, resulting in reactivation of tumor cell phagocytosis.</p>Raji cells express neither PD-L2 nor other ligands for PD-1 as described elsewhere (Andorsky et al, 2011, doi.</p>Although it is accepted that PD-1-PD-L1 blockade reactivates T cells, here the inventors show novel properties of anti-PD-1 antibodies through direct regeneration of macrophages. It is demonstrated that humanized anti-PD-1 antibodies can block the interaction of PD-1/PD-L1 on the same macrophage and promote phagocytosis of PD-L1 negative tumor cells. This aspect is of particular clinical significance since patients expressing PD-L1 on the surface of tumor cells receive PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. The data presented here show that even PD-L1 negative tumors can benefit from humanized anti-PD-1 antibodies by reactivating macrophage phagocytosis.</p>Materials and methods</p>ELISA binding to PD1</p>For the activity ELISA assay, recombinant hPD (Sino Biologicals, beijing, china; reference 10377-H08H) was immobilized on plastic at 0.5.
