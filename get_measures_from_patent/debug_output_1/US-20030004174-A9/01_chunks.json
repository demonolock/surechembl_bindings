    "o the synthetic substrates poly(Glu, Tyr) 4:1 or poly(Arg, Ser) 3:1 attached to the bioactive surface of microtiter plates serves as the basis to evaluate enzyme activity. After an incubation period, the amount of phosphate transferred is measured by first washing the plate with 0.5% phosphoric acid, adding liquid scintillant, and then counting in a liquid scintillation detector. The IC<sub>50 </sub>is determined by the concentration of compound that causes a 50% reduction in the amount of <sup>33</sup>P incorporated onto the substrate bound to the plate. </p>[0223] Other similar methods whereby phosphate is transferred to peptide or polypeptide substrate containing tyrosine, serine, threonine, or histidine, either alone, in combination, or in combination with other amino acids, in solution or immobilized (i.e., solid phase) are also useful. For example, transfer of phosphate to a peptide or polypeptide can also be detected using scintillation proximity (Wu et al., 2000), ELISA (Cleaveland et al., 1990), Fluorescence Polarization (Seethala and Menzel, 1998), and homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF, Kolb et al., 1998). Alternatively, kinase activity can be measured using antibody-based methods whereby an antibody or polypeptide is used as a reagent to detect phosphorylated target polypeptide. The compounds of the invention described herein are potent and selective kinase inhibitors as demonstrated by representative compounds described herein that inhibit kinases with IC50 values at between about 10 nM and about 5 M or greater. Representative results are summarized in the tables below. </p>REFERENCES [0224] Braunwalder A F, Yarwood D R, Hall T, Missbach M, Lipson K E, Sills MA. (1996).
