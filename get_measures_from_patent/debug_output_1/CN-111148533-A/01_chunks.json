    "lls, and may be autologous, allogeneic or xenogeneic. In some embodiments, the cell may be immortalized. In some embodiments, to reduce the chance of an immune response, cells are encapsulated to avoid infiltration of surrounding tissues. In some embodiments, the encapsulating material is generally a biocompatible, semi-permeable polymeric shell or membrane that allows the release of the protein product but prevents the cells from being destroyed by other deleterious factors of the patient's immune system or surrounding tissues.</p>Application method</p>In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides methods of expanding or activating CAR effector cells (e.g., CAR-T cells) in a subject comprising administering a composition comprising an amphiphilic ligand conjugate described herein.</p>In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides methods of stimulating proliferation of CAR effector cells (e.g., CAR-T cells) in a subject comprising administering a composition comprising an amphiphilic ligand conjugate described herein.</p>Methods for determining cell expansion, activation and proliferation are known to those skilled in the art. For example, the number of cells at a particular location (e.g., lymph node, blood, tumor) can be determined by isolating the cells and analyzing by flow cytometry. In some embodiments, the cells are stained with a suitable marker, such as an activation marker (e.g., CD80, CD86, 41BBL, ICOSL, or OX40L) and/or a proliferation marker (e.g., Ki 67). In some embodiments, the cell number is measured by introducing a dye (e.g., crystal violet) into the cell and measuring the dilution of the dye over time, wherein the dilution indicates cell proliferation.</p>In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides methods for treating a subject having a disease, disorder, or condition associated with increased coanda or expression of an antigen, comprising administering to the subject a CAR effector cell (e.g., CAR-T cell) targeted to the antigen and an amphiphilic ligand conjugate.</p>In some embodiments, the CAR effector cells (CAR-T cells) are administered to the subject prior to receiving the amphiphilic ligand conjugate. In some embodiments, the CAR effector cells (CAR-T cells) are administered to the subject after receiving the amphiphilic ligand conjugate. In some embodiments, the CAR effector cell (CAR-T cell) and the amphiphilic ligand conjugate are administered to the subject sequentially or simultaneously.</p>In some embodiments, wherein the CAR comprises a tag binding domain, the methods disclosed herein further comprise administering a preparation of a marker protein, wherein the tag binding domain binds to the marker protein. In some embodiments, the protein of the marker protein is an antibody or antigen-binding fragment. In some embodiments, the tag binding domain is an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof. In some embodiments, the preparation of labeled protein is administered to the subject pri"
