    "onomers can include as many as ten changes from a wild-type Fc domain monomer sequence (e.g., 1-10, 1-8, 1-6, 1-4 amino acid substitutions, additions, or deletions) that alter the interaction between an Fc domain and an Fc receptor. Examples of suitable changes are known in the art.</p>As used herein, the term \u201cFc domain\u201d refers to a dimer of two Fc domain monomers. In the wild-type Fc domain, the two Fc domain monomers dimerize by the interaction between the two C<sub>H</sub>3 antibody constant domains, as well as one or more disulfide bonds that form between the hinge domains of the two dimerizing Fc domain monomers. In some embodiments, an Fc domain may be mutated to lack effector functions, typical of a \u201cdead Fc domain.\u201d In certain embodiments, each of the Fc domain monomers in an Fc domain includes amino acid substitutions in the C<sub>H</sub>2 antibody constant domain to reduce the interaction or binding between the Fc domain and an Fc\u03b3 receptor.</p>As used herein, the term \u201caffinity\u201d or \u201cbinding affinity\u201d refers to the strength of the binding interaction between two molecules. Generally, binding affinity refers to the strength of the sum total of non-covalent interactions between a molecule and its binding partner, such as a SIRP-\u03b1 variant and CD47. Unless indicated otherwise, binding affinity refers to intrinsic binding affinity, which reflects a 1:1 interaction between members of a binding pair. The binding affinity between two molecules is commonly described by the dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) or the affinity constant (K<sub>A</sub>). Two molecules that have low binding affinity for each other generally bind slowly, tend to dissociate easily, and exhibit a large K<sub>D</sub>. Two molecules that have high affinity for each other generally bind readily, tend to remain bound longer, and exhibit a small K<sub>D</sub>. The K<sub>D </sub>of two interacting molecules may be determined using methods and techniques well known in the art, e.g., surface plasmon resonance. K<sub>D </sub>is calculated as the ratio of k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>.</p>As used herein, the term \u201chost cell\u201d refers to a vehicle that includes the necessary cellular components, e.g., organelles, needed to express proteins from their corresponding nucleic acids. The nucleic acids are typically included in nucleic acid vectors that can be introduced into the host cell by conventional techniques known in the art (e.g., transformation, transfection, electroporation, calcium phosphate precipitation, direct microinjection, etc.). A host cell may be a prokaryotic cell, e.g., a bacterial cell, or a eukaryotic cell, e.g., a mammalian cell (e.g., a CHO cell). As described herein, a host cell is used to express one or more SIRP-\u03b1 variant constructs.</p>As used herein, the term \u201cpharmaceutical composition\u201d refers to a medicinal or pharmaceutical formulation that contains an active ingredient as well as excipients and diluents to enable the active ingredient suitable for the",
    "er embodiments, one or more amino acids of SIRP-\u03b1 may be substituted with non-histidine residues in order to affect the binding of naturally occurring or substituted histidine residues with CD47. For example, substituting amino acids surrounding a naturally occurring histidine residue with other amino acids may \u201cbury\u201d the naturally occurring histidine residue. In some embodiments, amino acids not directly involved in binding with CD47, i.e., internal amino acids (e.g., amino acids located at the core of SIRP-\u03b1) may also be substituted with histidine residues. Table 4 lists specific SIRP-\u03b1 amino acids that may be substituted with histidine or non-histidine residues. Contact residues are the amino acids located at the interface of SIRP-\u03b1 and CD47. Core residues are the internal amino acids not directly involved in the binding between SIRP-\u03b1 and CD47. The SIRP-\u03b1 variants may include one or more (e.g., one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, etc., or all) of the substitutions listed in Table 4.</p>SIRP-\u03b1 variants containing one or more (e.g., one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, etc., with a maximum number of 20) histidine residue substitutions may be tested for their binding to CD47 under different pH conditions (e.g., at pH 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.4, 8). In some embodiments, purified CD47 protein may be used to test binding. Various techniques known to those skilled in the art may be used to measure the affinity constant (K<sub>A</sub>) or dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of a SIRP-\u03b1 variant/CD47 complex under different pH conditions (e.g., at pH 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.4, 8). In a preferred embodiment, the binding affinity of a SIRP-\u03b1 variant to a CD47 may be determined using surface plasmon resonance (e.g., Biacore3000\u2122 surface plasmon resonance (SPR) system, Biacore, INC, Piscataway N.J.). In an exemplary embodiment, a SIRP-\u03b1 variant with pH-dependent binding, which specifically binds a CD47 with higher affinity at pH 6 than at pH 7.4, exhibits a lower K<sub>D </sub>at pH 6 than at pH 7.4.</p>IV. Hypoxia-Dependent BindingTumor hypoxia is the condition in which tumor cells have been deprived of oxygen. As a tumor grows, its blood supply is constantly redirected to the most fast growing parts of the tumor, leaving portions of the tumor with oxygen concentration significantly lower than in healthy tissues.</p>In some embodiments, a SIRP-\u03b1 variant may be attached to a hypoxia-activated prodrug, which may act to increase the efficacy of a SIRP-alpha variant against the relevant diseased cells under specifically hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia-activated prodrugs are known in the literature, such as those described by Kling et al. (Nature Biotechnology, 30:381, 2012), herein incorporated by reference.</p>V. Antibody BindingAnother strategy to provide selective SIRP-\u03b1 activity at a diseased site than at a non-diseased site is to attach the SIRP-\u03b1 protein to a protein or peptide that can bind to a region of an antibody",
    "rein.</p>In some embodiments, the blocking peptide has higher affinity towards wild-type SIRP-\u03b1 than engineered SIRP-\u03b1 variant. Once the linker is cleaved, the blocking peptide dissociates from the SIRP-\u03b1 variant and may bind to a wild-type SIRP-\u03b1. A blocking peptide with different binding affinities to wild-type SIRP-\u03b1 and SIRP-\u03b1 variant may be identified using methods and techniques commonly known in the art, e.g., directed evolution and display libraries (e.g., phage or yeast display). In one exemplary embodiment, a nucleotide encoding the SIRP-\u03b1 binding region of CD47 or a nucleotide encoding the variable region of an anti-SIRP-\u03b1 antibody may be mutated and/or recombined at random to create a large library of gene variants using techniques such as, e.g., error-prone PCR and DNA shuffling. Once a genetic library is created, the mutant peptides encoded by the nucleotides may be screened for their ability to bind to wild-type SIRP-\u03b1 and SIRP-\u03b1 variant using, e.g., phage or yeast display. Identified peptides that can bind to both wild-type SIRP-\u03b1 and SIRP-\u03b1 variant may undergo a second screening process such that the proteins that bind with higher affinity to wild-type SIRP-\u03b1 than to SIRP-\u03b1 variant may be isolated. The identified peptides, once bound to wild-type SIRP-\u03b1 or SIRP-\u03b1 variant should prevent the binding of CD47 to wild-type SIRP-\u03b1 or SIRP-\u03b1 variant. Various techniques known to those skilled in the art may be used to measure the affinity constant (K<sub>A</sub>) or dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of a SIRP-\u03b1 variant/blocking peptide complex or a wild-type SIRP-\u03b1/blocking peptide complex. A blocking peptide may bind with at least three fold higher affinity to a wild-type SIRP-\u03b1 than a SIRP-\u03b1 variant.</p>CD47-Based Blocking Peptides</p>A blocking peptide may be a CD47 mimic polypeptide, or a CD47 fragment that can bind a SIRP-\u03b1 variant described herein. Some blocking peptides may bind a SIRP-\u03b1 variant at a site that is different from the CD47 binding site. Some blocking peptides may bind a SIRP-\u03b1 variant in a manner that is different from CD47. In some cases, the blocking peptide may comprise at least one stabilizing disulfide bond. A blocking peptide may comprise a polypeptide sequence of CERVIGTGWVRC (SEQ ID NO: 110), or a fragment or variant thereof. A variant blocking peptide may contain one or more conservative or non-conservative modification. In some cases a variant blocking peptide may contain modifications of a cysteine to a serine and/or one or more modifications of an asparagine to a glutamine. A blocking peptide may bind to the SIRP-\u03b1 variant at the same site as a peptide that comprises a polypeptide sequence of CERVIGTGWVRC (SEQ ID NO: 110), or a variant or fragment thereof. A blocking peptide may comprise a polypeptide sequence of GNYTCEVTELTREGETIIELK (SEQ ID NO: 39), or a fragment or variant thereof. A blocking peptide may bind to the SIRP-\u03b1 variant at the same site as a peptide that comprises a polypeptide sequence ",
    " two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, etc., with a maximum of 20) substitutions of amino acids with histidine residues may be generated using conventional molecular cloning and protein expression techniques. A nucleic acid molecule encoding a SIRP-\u03b1 variant of the invention may be cloned into a vector optimized for expression in bacteria using well known molecular biology techniques. The vector can then be transformed into bacteria cells (e.g., E. coli cells), which may be grown to optimal density prior to protein expression induction. After protein expression induction (i.e., using IPTG), bacterial cells may be allowed to grow for an additional 24 hours. Cells can be collected and the expressed SIRP-\u03b1 variant protein may be purified from the cell culture supernatant using, e.g., affinity column chromatography. Purified SIRP-\u03b1 variant may be analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining to confirm the presence of protein bands of expected size.</p>Purified SIRP-\u03b1 variants may be screened for pH-dependent binding to CD47 using available techniques in the art, such as phage display, yeast display, surface plasmon resonance, scintillation proximity assays, ELISA, ORIGEN immunoassay (IGEN), fluorescence quenching, and/or fluorescence transfer. Binding may also be screened using a suitable bioassay. The desired SIRP-\u03b1 variant binds with higher affinity to CD47 under acidic pH (e.g., less than pH 7 (e.g., pH 6)) than under neutral pH (e.g., pH 7.4). The KD of a SIRP-\u03b1/CD47 complex at pH 6 would be lower than KD of a SIRP-\u03b1/CD47 complex at pH 7.4.</p>Example 10\u2014Testing SIRP-\u03b1 Variants with pH-Dependent Binding to CD47 in MiceGenetically engineered mouse models of various cancers, e.g., solid tumor and hematological cancer, may be used to test the pH-dependent binding of SIRP-\u03b1 variants of the invention to CD47 at a diseased site in a mouse model. A SIRP-\u03b1 variant may be injected directly or indirectly to the diseased site in a mouse, which may be dissected at the later time to detect the presence of the complex of SIRP-\u03b1 variant and CD47 at the diseased site. Antibodies specific to SIRP-\u03b1 variant or CD47 may be used in the detection.</p>OTHER EMBODIMENTSAll publications, patents, and patent applications mentioned in the above specification are hereby incorporated by reference.
