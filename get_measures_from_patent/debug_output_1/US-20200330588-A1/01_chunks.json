Analysis of the Potency of HCMV-Neutralizing Antibodies</p>In order to examine the specificity of our HCMV-neutralizing antibodies, a reporter virus derived from the TB40/E HCMV strain was utilized, in which the US28 coding region was replaced with a DNA cassette encoding a FLAG-tagged YFP chimera (TB40/E<sub>FLAG-YFP</sub>). The TB40/E<sub>FLAG-YFP </sub>strain creates a robust fluorescent signal in the cytoplasm of infected cells that can be visualized beginning at 48 hpi and increasing in intensity throughout the infection cycle. TB40/E<sub>FLAG-YFP </sub>pre-incubated with \u03b1-gH and \u03b1-gB supernatants at 3 concentrations was used to infect MRC5 fibroblasts. At 120 hpi, fluorescence intensity was used to determine the number of YFP+ cells to calculate % infection using a non-neutralizing hybridoma as 100% (FIG. 3A). Surprisingly, while supernatant from \u03b1-gH hybridomas 14-4b, 10C10 and 5C3 significantly blocked infection at all concentrations, the gB antibodies did not reduce infection levels at any of the dilutions tested. These results imply that the anti-gB mAbs, while potentially being capable of neutralizing individual HCMV viral strains, do not broadly-inhibit a HCMV infection by themselves.</p>To further assess the potency of the antibody panel, the IC50 values of the neutralizing antibodies were calculated using a AD169<sub>IE2-YFP </sub>or TB40/E<sub>FLAG-YFP </sub>HTN assay (FIGS. 3B, 3C, and 3D). The neutralizing capability of the antibodies was compared to Cytogam\u00ae antibodies, a commercially-available polyclonal IgG preparation derived from HCMV seropositive individuals and currently used for treatment of reactivated HCMV infection. All of the antibodies from the panel potently neutralized AD169<sub>IE2-YFP </sub>infection, with IC50 values ranging from 0.24 \u03bcg/mL (5C3) to 5.2 \u03bcg/mL (7H7) (FIGS. 3C, 3D, left columns), while the Cytogam\u00ae polyclonal antisera exhibited an IC50 value of 18.62 \u03bcg/mL (FIG. 3B, left column). Anti-gH antibodies 10C10 and 5C3 displayed potent neutralization of TB40/E<sub>FLAG-YFP </sub>infection, with IC50 values of 0.38 \u03bcg/mL and 0.07 \u03bcg/mL, respectively (FIG. 3C, right column). The Cytogam\u00ae polyclonal antisera exhibited also displayed an improved IC50 value of 0.46 \u03bcg/mL (FIG. 3B, right column). Strikingly, purified anti-gB antibodies were unable to reduce infection levels, even at a concentration exceeding 24 \u03bcg/mL (FIG. 3D, right column). To determine whether the anti-gB antibodies were capable of binding to the gB protein from the TB40/E strain, the anti-gB neutralizing mAbs were incubated with lysates from TB40/E WT-infected MRC5 cells and the recovered proteins were subjected to an anti-gB immunoblot (FIG. 3E). All gB antibodies were capable of recovering gB protein from TB40/E-infected cells. Although the gB-specific antibodies were capable of binding to the TB40/E gB protein, they were unable to neutralize a TB40/E infection. Collectively, the data demonstrate that the neutralizing antibody panel consists of anti-gH and anti-gB antibodies with diverse potency.</p>4. Analysis of the Ability of Anti-gH Antibodies to Block Viral Infection and Dissemination</p>The ability of the \u03b1-gH antibodies to neutralize additional clinical-like CMV strains was examined. Monoclonal antibodies 10C10 and 5C3 were pre-incubated with HCMV strains TB40/E, DAVIS, VHL/E, and TR at 9 \u03bcg/mL prior to infection of MRC5 fibroblasts. At 72 hpi, total cell lysate were subjected to immunoblot analysis using an antibody to late antigen (FIG. 9A). Cells infected with non-treated virus demonstrated late antigen expression in all cases while cells infected with virus samples pre-incubated with 10C10 or 5C3 showed a nearly complete reduction of late antigen expression. This data demonstrates that \u03b1-gH antibodies are capable of limiting clinical HCMV infection in fibroblasts.</p>To determine the potency of the \u03b1-gH mAbs against clinical-like strains, w a HTN assay using a fluorescently labeled antibody against the Immediate Early (IE) gene product (\u03b1-IE<sup>FITC</sup>) was developed. AD169WT, TB40/EWT, VHL/E, and TR were pre-incubated with increasing concentrations of \u03b1-gH mAb or Cytogam\u00ae antibodies (FIG. 4A) followed by analysis of \u03b1-IE<sup>FITC</sup>+ cells and the determination of the % infection. Both mAbs 10C10 and 5C3 potently neutralized infection of fibroblasts by clinical-like strains with IC50 values ranging from 0.28 \u03bcg/mL to 4.18 \u03bcg/mL (FIG. 4C, top two rows, and Table 5), while the Cytogam\u00ae antibodies were unable to block any of the viral infections at identical concentrations (FIG. 4C, bottom row, and Table 5).</p>Finally, to assess how \u03b1-gH mAbs affect HCMV proliferation, plaque reduction assays were performed in MRC5 cells infected with clinical-like strains DAVIS, TB40/EWT, VHL/E and TR (FIG. 4B). The \u03b1-gH mAbs reduced infection by all of the clinical strains analyzed with IC50 values ranging between 0.02 \u03bcg/mL and 2.43 \u03bcg/mL (FIG. 4B, top two rows, and Table 5). Strikingly, the Cytogam\u00ae antibodies were unable to limit plaque numbers of any of the clinical-like strains with the exception of VHL/E, where it exhibited an IC50 of 0.12 \u03bcg/mL (FIG. 4B, bottom row, and Table 5). These data demonstrated the ability of the neutralizing anti-HCMV mAbs to block cell-free infection and limit viral dissemination.</p>5. Examination of the Broad-Spectrum Neutralization Capability of Anti-gH mAbs in Epithelial Cells</p>To further analyze the efficacy of the \u03b1-gH mAbs as a broad spectrum anti-viral, the potency in blocking virus infection of human retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE-19) was examinde. Accordingly, the TB40/E<sub>FLAG-YFP </sub>reporter strain was utilized to measure the efficacy of \u03b1-gH mAbs to block infection of ARPE-19 cells (FIG. 9B). The mAbs 10C10 and 5C3 potently blocked infection with IC50 values of 0.13 \u03bcg/mL (10C10) and 0.04 \u03bcg/mL (5C3) (Table 5). Additionally, the capacity of 10C10 and 5C3 to inhibit infection of TB40/E-WT, VHL/E, and TR were analyzed using the HTN assay with \u03b1-IE<sup>FITC</sup>. The IC50 values of the mAbs against the viruses ranged from 0.11 to 1.35 \u03bcg/mL (FIG. 4C, rows 1-2 and Table 5). The Cytogam\u00ae antibodies exhibited variable ability to neutralize ARPE-19 infection, with IC50 values exceeding 6 \u03bcg/mL for TB40/E WT and VHL/E infection, and 1.58 \u03bcg/mL for the clinical strain TR (FIG. 4C, bottom row and Table 5). This demonstrated that the \u03b1-gH mAbs 10C10 and 5C3 are capable of neutralizing epithelial cell infection by various clinical-like strains.</p>TABLE 5Different HCMV strains and assays performedStrainAD169-TB40/EIE2-YFOFLAG-YFPTRTB40/EVHL/EDavisCell TypeFibroblastFibroblastFibroblastEpithelialFibroblastEpithelialFibroblastEpithelialFibroblastsAssayIE2FLAG-YFPPlaque\u03b1-IE\u03b1-IEPlaque\u03b1-IE\u03b1-IEPlaque\u03b1-IE\u03b1-IEPlaque10C100.50.382.432.340.441.284.181.350.240.240.110.375C30.240.072.130.630.160.450.880.960.020.020.110.22Cytogam18.620.46&gt;6.25&gt;12.151.58&gt;6.25&gt;12.156.860.12&gt;12.1510.91&gt;6.25</p>6. Examination of the Capacity of Anti-gH mAbs to Block Cell-to-Cell Dissemination</p>To test whether the mAbs could also neutralize infection of replicated virus, transwell infection studies were conducted in fibroblast and epithelial cells (FIG. 4D). MRC5 fibroblasts in the top (transwell) layer were infected with TB40/E (moi:1) and two days later, the membrane was inserted into a receiver well consisting of a monolayer of MRC5 fibroblasts (FIG. 4E left panel) or ARPE-19 cells (FIG. 4E, right panel). The receiver well contained various concentrations of \u03b1-gH mAb, Cytogam\u00ae antibodies, or an isotype control (0.1-44 mL). At 7 days post infection (dpi), the receiver wells were stained with \u03b1-IE<sup>FITC </sup>to determine number of virus-infected cells",
    "onformational epitope library array. The arrays were incubated with mAb 5C3 followed by an anti-mouse DyLight680 antibody and analyzed with a LI-COR Odyssey imaging system (FIG. 6A). Remarkably, 5C3 bound \u02dc3-fold over background to a single region spanning residues 485-493 in all of the peptide libraries generated. The identified region is located in domain 2 of the gH protein according to the conventions assigned to the HSV-1 gH structure (FIG. 6B). Alignment of the HCMV gH protein was conducted using the PHYRE2 protein fold recognition server. HCMV-gH possesses significant structural homology with the gH of herpes simplex 2 (HSV-2), varicella-zoster (VZV), and Epstein-Barr (EBV). While the highest percentage identity score was assigned to EBV gH, recent evidence indicates that the HCMV gH/gL structure resembles the boot-shaped particle of the HSV gH/gL structure. Thus a 3D model of HCMV-gH was predicted based on the alignment between the hidden Markov model of the HSV-2 gH and HCMV-gH. The putative 5C3 epitope amino acid 485-493 region was predicted to exist within an alphahelical region spanning amino acids 485-495 in HCMV-gH (FIG. 6C). Analysis of the space-filling model indicated that the putative epitope region was located on a surface-exposed alpha helix, thus supporting the model that the 5C3 epitope is exposed on the surface of gH.</p>To confirm the identity of the 5C3 epitope and determine if 10C10 also targeted this region of the gH protein, a flow cytometry-based binding assay was established using gH mutants constructed by substituting residues within the putative epitope region with alanine. The mutant constructs were then transfected into HEK-293 cells together with gL, and binding by anti-gH antibodies was analyzed with flow cytometry. The validity of the assay was first demonstrated by transfecting wildtype gH, a mutant construct containing two alanine substitutions upstream of the putative epitope region (478-79), and a mutant containing a single alanine substitution in the human anti-gH monoclonal antibody MSL-109 epitope region (aa168) (FIG. 6D). While 10C10, 5C3 and MSL-109 all bound to the wildtype gH or the 478-79 alanine substitution mutant, only 10C10 and 5C3 exhibited binding to the gH 168 mutant. Next, two additional mutants containing consecutive alanine substitutions spanning within the putative epitope region (aa480-486 and 485-492) were generated for binding analysis (FIG. 6E). Remarkably, while MSL-109 bound both of these constructs at levels similar to those observed for the wildtype gH, both 10C10 and 5C3 were unable to bind the 480-486 mutant (FIG. 6E, left column and FIG. 6F). Strikingly, while 5C3 binding was restored in the 485-492 mutant, 10C10 was again unable to bind to the mutant (FIG. 6E, right column and FIG. 6F). The binding studies validate that both 5C3 and 10C10 recognize one or more epitopes, believed to be conformational, within SEQ ID NO: 1.</p>For a high-resolution picture of the specific residu"
