For optimization of pH dependence, positions within FcB6 that are close to histidine 433 of the binding partner IgG were allowed to vary, this included also maximal variations of the suboptimal positions A135 and E138. The objective was to identify variants that would have different affinities for Fc at different pH levels. The purpose of this will be that the bound antibody or Fc fusion protein could then be easily eluted with small variation of the pH value. Hence the objective of the selection of this library was to identify binders that would bind tight at one pH level, but a lot weaker at others. Sequence alignments for well binding clones at indicated pH levels using a PBS buffer are shown below: Sequences resulting from the yeast surface display selection at pH 6.5 are shown in Figure 3A and at pH 8 are shown in Figure 3B. \n\n We then determined the Kd of exemplary isolated clones for IgG at different pHs. Measurements were taken via titrations of biotinylated Rituxan (Rituximab) using yeast surface display as discussed in the materials and methods sections. These studies showed that, on average, variants that were isolated at pH 8 did not have optimized binding at pH 6.5, whereas isolates from the lower pH selections (at pH 6.5) tend to bind similarly at either pH. When comparing sequences between the two selection trajectories at the two different pH levels, we quickly could identify clones with different sequence profiles. From the pH 8 screen, we isolated various clones that had several fold poorer binding affinity at pH 6.5 compared to pH 8. Hence, we achieved our objective to identify variants that would have different affinity for the Fc domain at different pH levels. One exemplary clone (FcB6.1) had reasonable affinity (around 2 nM using this assay) and 6-7 fold worse affinity at pH 6.5, and was further characterized. </p> Our designed protein (FcB6) and its variants are modeled to bind to the consensus region between the CH2 and CH3 domain of the Fc region of IgGs (Fig.1) and to parts of the CH2 domain that contains histidine 433 and asparagine 434. The computational designed protein uses various residues on a helical structure to bind to the cleft between those two domains, to which other native proteins, such as Protein A, neonatal receptor (FcRn) or the rheumatoid factor bind to. Within this helix sequence (Z",
    "e, and the positive charge interacts highly beneficially with the negative surface charge of the epitope on Fc. However, as soon as the histidine 433 residues becomes protonated, which happens when lowering the pH level(&lt; ~ 6.5), it also becomes positively charged, thereby introducing a repulsion between arginine 135 of the design and the now also positively charged histidine. Additionally, the hydrogen bond with serine 134 and the histidine is not possible anymore due to the protonation, which further weakens overall the interaction between IgG and the design, thus making it highly pH sensitive. </p> Alternatively, mutations at 135 that cover the histidine, but do not have a charge, result in improvements of the binding affinity due to a larger contact area and they can still render the interaction slightly pH sensitive, as the buried hydrogen bond with serine 134 will be still dependent on the protonation state of the histidine 433. Hence interaction that cover and contact the histidine will still produce reasonable binding to the IgG, but with less pH sensitivity. </p> We also performed deep sequencing analysis of mutagenized and selected clones after mild selection conditions to figure out tolerated residues at different positions. These studies showed that Z2 (as defined above) can be modified as follows: </p>G(F/V)(E/D)(V/G)(Y/C)L(L/F)R(D/E/N)AVKG(I/V/F)KP (SEQ ID NO: 85) </p> The most interesting polypeptides obtained from the pH focused screen are shown below.

However, no other amino acid is identical, and FcB6 differs substantially in binding mode from Protein A as most of its additional contacts are with the CH3 domain of Fc and not with CH2. The wild-type protein on which FcB6 is based on the structure of pyrazinamidase of Pyrococcus horikoshii<sup>7</sup>, and is completely inert to Fc suggesting that the designed surface mediates binding. Further competition with Protein A completely inhibited binding of FcB6 to the IgGl Rituxan, indicating that it was indeed binding to the same consensus epitope. </p> To confirm the designed binding mode and identify possible avenues for improving the computationally designed sequence, we used PCR mutagenesis in concert with one r",
    "towards CH3. </p> Protein production yields and stability are key determinants for the usefulness of affinity reagents. FcB6.1 is an attractive candidate in this regard as it is derived from a protein scaffold of a hyperthermophilic organism. FcB6.1 expresses well in is. coli, yielding around -60-70 mg/L in shake flasks without any optimization, and is very stable. CD spectral analysis indicates melting only starts at temperatures higher than 80\u00b0C. FcB6.1 can be readily obtained in nearly pure form by subjecting bacteria to 80\u00b0C for 20 min followed by centrifugation. FcB6.1 is stable to urea up to 3 M and guandine HC1 up to 1.5 M guanidine. Also, repeated heating cycles up to 80\u00b0C did not denature the protein. Thus, FcB6.1 has considerable potential utility in chip- or bead-based assays and diagnostics: a simple heating procedure or denaturant wash would allow recovery of the antibody capture agent. </p> To examine the specificity of FcB6.1, we measured binding to biotinylated human IgG from different subclasses and commonly used IgGs from other species. Binding of the IgGs to the minimized Protein A variant<sup>10</sup> (miniA) was measured for comparison. As expected FcB6.1 binds tightly to human IgG2, IgG4 and IgGl, slightly better than the miniA, and comparably to mouse IgGl and IgG2a. FcB6.1 only binds weakly to IgG3 (which Protein A does not bind), and unlike Protein A, weakly to rat IgG2a. </p> Surface plasmon resonance measurements of the purified protein indicated a dissociation constant of around 33 nM to immobilized Rituxan at pH 8.2 and severely \n\n reduced affinity (&gt; 1 \u03bc\u039c) at pH 5.5; very favorable characteristics for pH dependent chromatography. To test whether FcB6.1 could serve for affinity purification of IgG molecules, we added a C-terminal cysteine residue accompanied by a short glycine serine linker to couple the protein site-specifically to a resin (SulfoLink, Thermo Scientific). To simulate a possible purification scenario, we spiked an IgG mix (20 \u03bcg, Innovative\u2122 </p> Research) into the supernatant of 293 Freestyle cell culture and incubated it with FcB6.1cys coated resin while rotating (see Methods). Almost complete elution was achieved by dropping the pH to 5.5 to ensure complete protonation of His433 and increasing the salt concentration to 500 mM (instead of commonly used 150 mM). Compared to Protein A, the FcB6. leys resin allows much milder conditions for elution, which can be crucial for antibodies that tend to aggregate and particularly to Fc-fusion constructs; indeed higher molecular weight aggregates were observed after elution from a Protein A resin under same conditions. </p> Partition of FcB6 and variants Combinatorial libraries to evaluate changes to one of the interface helices: residues 157 - 172 </p> To test small changes around the core interface helix that is similar to Protein A (4 residues in the original design, 3 in the FcB6.1 variants), we tested a combinatorial library for binding and found the c"
