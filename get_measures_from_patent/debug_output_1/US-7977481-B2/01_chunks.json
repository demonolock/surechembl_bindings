They are thus useful for the treatment of diseases and disorders that may be alleviated by inhibiting such ATP-binding enzyme activity. Methods of determining such ATP binding enzymes include those known to those of skill in the art, those discussed herein relating to selecting homologous enzymes, and by the use of the database PROSITE, where enzymes containing signatures, sequence patterns, motifs, or profiles of protein families or domains may be identified.</p>The compounds of the present invention, and their derivatives, may also be used as kinase-binding agents. As binding agents, such compounds and derivatives may be bound to a stable resin as a tethered substrate for affinity chromatography applications. The compounds of this invention, and their derivatives, may also be modified (e.g., radiolabelled or affinity labeled, etc.) in order to utilize them in the investigation of enzyme or polypeptide characterization, structure, and/or function.</p>In an exemplary embodiment, the pyrimidinyl-thiophene kinase modulator of the present invention is a kinase inhibitor.

In another embodiment, the kinase inhibitor has an IC<sub>50 </sub>or K<sub>1 </sub>of less than 1 micromolar. In another embodiment, the kinase inhibitor has an IC<sub>50 </sub>or K<sub>1 </sub>of less than 500 nanomolar. In another embodiment, the kinase inhibitor has an IC<sub>50 </sub>or K<sub>1 </sub>of less than 10 nanomolar.

By \u201ckinase-mediated\u201d or \u201ckinase-associated\u201d diseases is meant diseases in which the disease or symptom can be alleviated by inhibiting kinase activity (e.g. where the kinase is involved in signaling, mediation, modulation, or regulation of the disease process). By \u201cdiseases\u201d is meant diseases, or disease symptoms. The method includes administering to the subject an effective amount of a pyrimidinyl-thiophene kinase modulator of the present invention (e.g. the compounds of any one of Formula (I).</p>Examples of kinase associated diseases include cancer (e.g. leukemia, tumors, and metastases), allergy, asthma, obesity, inflammati",
    " any appropriate means, such as radioactivity (e.g. [\u03b3-<sup>32</sup>P-ATP]), or the use of detectable secondary antibodies (e.g. ELISA). Alternatively, the formation of a phosphorylated substrate may be detected using any appropriate technique, such as the detection of ATP concentration (e.g. Kinase-Glo\u00ae assay system (Promega)). Kinase inhibitors are identified by detecting the formation of a phosphorylated substrate in the presence and absence of a test compound (see Examples section below).</p>The ability of the compound to inhibit a kinase in a cell may also be assayed using methods well known in the art. For example, cells containing a kinase may be contacted with an activating agent (such as a growth factor) that activates the kinase. The amount of intracellular phosphorylated substrate formed in the absence and the presence of the test compound may be determined by lysing the cells and detecting the presence phosphorylated substrate by any appropriate method (e.g. ELISA). Where the amount of phosphorylated substrate produced in the presence of the test compound is decreased relative to the amount produced in the absence of the test compound, kinase inhibition is indicated. More detailed cellular kinase assays are discussed in the Examples section below.</p>To measure the binding of a compound to a kinase, any method known to those of ordinary skill in the art may be used. For example, a test kit manufactured by Discoverx (Fremont, Calif.), ED-Staurosporine NSIP\u2122 Enzyme Binding Assay Kit (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,643,734) may be used. Kinase activity may also be assayed as in U.S. Pat. No. 6,589,950, issued Jul. 8, 2003.</p>Suitable kinase inhibitors may be selected from the compounds of the invention through protein crystallographic screening, as disclosed in, for example Antonysamy, et al., PCT Publication No. WO03087816A1, which is incorporate herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.</p>The compounds of the present invention may be computationally screened to assay and visualize their ability to bind to and/or inhibit various kinases. The structure may be computationally screened with a plurality of compounds of the present invention to determine their ability to bind to a kinase at various sites. Such compounds can be used as targets or leads in medicinal chemistry efforts to identify, for example, inhibitors of potential therapeutic importance (Travis, Science, 262:1374, 1993). The three dimensional structures of such compounds may be superimposed on a three dimensional representation of kinases or an active site or binding pocket thereof to assess whether the compound fits spatially into the representation and hence the protein. In this screening, the quality of fit of such entities or compounds to the binding pocket may be judged either by shape complementarity or by estimated interaction energy (Meng, et al., J. Comp. Chem. 13:505-24, 1992).</p>The screening of compounds of the present invention that bind to and/or modulate k",
