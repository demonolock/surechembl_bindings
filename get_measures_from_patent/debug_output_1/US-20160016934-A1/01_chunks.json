    "tected derivative thereof; and\n\n(ii) Intermediate D, as hereinbefore defined (i.e. a compound of formula (VII), as hereinbefore defined) or a salt or protected derivative thereof.\n</p>Protected derivatives of Intermediates B and D include amides or, particularly, carbamates of those compounds. For example, those protected derivatives include compounds in which a H-atom of the NH<sub>2 </sub>group is replaced by:\nR\u2032\u2014C(O)\u2014, wherein R\u2032 is H, C<sub>1-8 </sub>alkyl, phenyl or benzyl, which latter two groups are optionally substituted by one or more groups selected from halo, hydroxy, methyl and methoxy; orR\u2033\u2014O\u2014C(O)\u2014, wherein R\u2033 is tert-butyl, phenyl, benzyl or fluorenyl, which latter three groups are optionally substituted by one or more groups selected from halo, hydroxy, methyl and methoxy.\n</p>The compounds of formula (I) are p38 MAP kinase inhibitors (especially of the alpha subtype) and in one aspect the compounds are useful in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, for example COPD and/or asthma.</p>Surprisingly, in at least some embodiments, the compounds of formula (I) exhibit a long duration of action and/or persistence of action.</p>In one embodiment the compounds of formula (I) do not strongly inhibit, or bind to GSK 3\u03b1, for example they have an IC<sub>50 </sub>value against GSK 3\u03b1 of 1500 nM or greater; such as 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000, 7,000, 8,000, 9,000 or 10,000 nM or greater.</p>Persistence of action as used herein is related to the dissociation rate or dissociation constant of the compound from the target (such as a receptor). A low dissociation rate may lead to persistence.</p>A low dissociation rate in combination with a high association rate tends to provide potent therapeutic entities.</p>The compounds of formula (I) are expected to be potent in vivo.</p>Typically, the prior art compounds developed to date have been intended for oral administration. This strategy involves optimizing the pharmacokinetic profile of drug substances in order to achieve an adequate duration of action. In this manner a sufficiently high drug concentration is established and maintained between doses to provide sustained clinical benefit. The inevitable consequence of this approach is that all bodily tissues, and especially the liver and the gut, are likely to be exposed to supra-therapeutically active concentrations of the drug, whether or not they are adversely affected by the disease being treated.</p>An alternative strategy is to design treatment paradigms in which the drug is dosed directly to the inflamed organ, that is, to exploit topical administration. Whilst this approach is not suitable for treating all chronic inflammatory diseases, it has been exploited in lung disorders, such as asthma and COPD; in skin diseases, for example against atopic dermatitis and psoriasis; for nasal conditions, typified by allergic rhinitis; and in gastrointestinal diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and inflammatory diseases of the e"
