    "of L-glutaminate by the Ba/F3 cell of expressing Bcr-Abl or Bcr-Abl mutant, 10%FCS, in the PRMI1640 growth medium of penicillin (200U/ml) and Streptomycin sulphate (200 \u03bc g/ml).Parental generation Ba/F3 cell is cultivated in identical being supplemented with in the substratum of 10ng/mlIL-3.</p>By parental generation Ba/F3 cell (being supplemented with IL-3) or express the Ba/F3 cell of WT or mutant Bcr-Abl in duplicate with 1x10\n        <sup>4</sup>cells/well is inoculated in 96-orifice plate, the described compound containing different concns in the medium in described 96-orifice plate.First described compound dissolution is diluted in DMSO and makes 4 times of diluents; Then isopyknic compound and DMSO are transferred in substratum, then transfer in cell plate.The final concentration of compound is from 10 \u03bcMs to 6nM.The DMSO of same percentage is with comparing.Compound and cell culture, after 3 days, use CellTiter96AQueousOneSolution cell proliferation test test kit that the quantity detecting viable cell is described according to test kit.Substantially, by tetrazolium\n        salt joins in incubation cultured cells and makes it be detectable product by viable cell Enzymatic transformation.Process cell, detects the optical density(OD) of cell to detect first\n        the amount of derivative.Mean number +/-SD is obtained from bipartite hole, and with the per-cent report relative to contrast absorbancy.MicorsoftExcel-fitting software optimum fit curve is used to calculate IC50.\n      </p>And, many cell types may be used for for antiproliferative activity SCREENED COMPOUND, comprise following clone: COLO205 (colorectal carcinoma), DLD-1 (colorectal carcinoma), HCT \u2013 15 (colorectal carcinoma), HT29 (colorectal carcinoma), HEPG2 (liver cancer), K-562 (leukemia), A549 (lung cancer), NCI \u2013 H249 (lung cancer), MCF7 (mammary cancer), MDA-MB-231 (mammary cancer), SAOS-2 (osteosarcoma), OVCAR-3 (ovarian cancer), PANC-1 (carcinoma of the pancreas), DU-145 (prostate cancer), PC-3 (prostate cancer), ACHN (kidney), CAKI \u2013 1 (kidney), MG-63 (sarcoma).</p>Although described clone is preferably mammiferous, the low eukaryotic cell that waits also can be used as yeast SCREENED COMPOUND.Preferred mammal cell line from people, rat, mouse, rabbit, monkey, hamster and cavy because from these organic cells be convenient to research and characterize.But, also can use other cell.</p>The mammal cell line be applicable to is usually from tumour.Such as, following tumor cell type can be the cell source of culturing cell: melanoma, myeloid leukemia, lung cancer, mammary cancer, ovarian cancer, colorectal carcinoma, kidney, prostate cancer, carcinoma of the pancreas and carcinoma of testis, myocardial cell (cardiomyocytes), endotheliocyte, epithelial cell, lymphocyte (T-cell and B cell), mastocyte, eosinophilic granulocyte, blood vessel lining cells, liver cell, white corpuscle (comprising mono-nuclear leukocytes), stem cell is (as hemopoietic stem cell, neural, skin, lun"
