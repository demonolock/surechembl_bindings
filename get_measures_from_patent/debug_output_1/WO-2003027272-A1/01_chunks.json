    "ls which contain a phosphoinositide kinase polynucleotide and which express a phosphoinositide kinase polypeptide can be identified by a variety of procedures known to those of skill in the art. These procedures include, but are not limited to, DNA-DNA or DNA-RNA hybridizations and protein bioassay or immunoassay techniques that include membrane, solution, or chip-based technologies for the detection and/or quantification of nucleic acid or protein. For example^ the presence of a polynucleotide sequence encoding a phosphoinositide kinase polypeptide can be detected by DNA-DNA or DNA-RNA hybridization or amplification using probes or fragments or fragments of polynucleotides encoding a phosphoinositide kinase polypeptide. Nucleic acid amplification-based assays involve the use of oligonucleotides selected from sequences encoding a \n\nphosphoinositide kinase polypeptide to detect transformants that contain a phosphoinositide kinase polynucleotide.</p>\n  A variety of protocols for detecting and measuring the expression of a phosphoinositide kinase polypeptide, using either polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies specific for the polypeptide, are known in the art. Examples include enzyme-linked immunosorbent<sup>'</sup> assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay (RIA), and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). A two-site, monoclonal-based immunoassay using monoclonal antibodies reactive to two non-interfering epitopes on a phosphoinositide kinase polypeptide can be used, or a competitive, binding assay can be employed. These and other assays are described in Hampton et al, SEROLOGICAL METHODS: A LABORATORY MANUAL, APS Press, St. Paul, Minn., 1990) and Maddox et \u03b1/., J Exp. Med. 158, 1211-1216, 1983).</p>\n  A wide variety of labels and conjugation techniques are known by those skilled in the art and can be used in various nucleic acid and amino acid assays. Means for producing labeled hybridization or PCR probes for detecting sequences related to polynucleotides encoding phosphoinositide kinase polypeptides include oligo- labeling, nick translation, end-labeling, or PCR amplification using a labeled nucleotide. Alternatively, sequences encoding a phosphoinositide kinase polypeptide can be cloned into a vector for the production of an mRNA probe. Such vectors are known in the art, are commercially available, and can be used to synthesize RNA probes in vitro by addition of labeled nucleotides and an appropriate RNA polymerase such as T7, T3, or SP6. These procedures can be conducted using a variety of commercially available kits (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Promega, and US</p>\n  Biochemical). Suitable reporter molecules or labels which can be used for ease of detection include radionuclides, enzymes, and fluorescent, chemiluminescent, or chromogenic agents, as well as substrates, cofactors, inhibitors, magnetic particles, and the like. \n\nExpression and Purification of Polypeptides</p>\n  Host cells transformed with nucleotide sequences encoding a phosphoinositide "
