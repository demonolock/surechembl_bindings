    "n agent that decreases cellular levels of Siglec-9 and/or inhibits interaction between Siglec-9 and one or more Siglec-9 ligands is an orthosteric inhibitor.</p>In certain embodiments, an agent that decreases cellular levels of Siglec-9 and/or inhibits interaction between Siglec-9 and one or more Siglec-9 ligands is a small molecule inhibitor, including, without limitation, small peptides or peptide-like molecules, soluble peptides, and synthetic non-peptidyl organic or inorganic compounds. A small molecule inhibitor may have a molecular weight of any of about 100 to about 20,000 daltons (Da), about 500 to about 15,000 Da, about 1000 to about 10,000 Da. Methods for making and testing the inhibitory effect a small molecule has on one or more Siglec-9 activities are well known in the art and such methods can be used to assess the effect of the small molecule inhibitor on Siglec-9 activity. For example, any of the methods and assays disclosed herein may be used to screen for small molecule inhibitors that decrease cellular levels of Siglec-9 and/or inhibit interaction between Siglec-9 and one or more Siglec-9 ligand.</p>In certain embodiments, an agent that decreases cellular levels of Siglec-9 and/or inhibits interaction between Siglec-9 and one or more Siglec-9 ligands is an anti-Siglec-9 antibody that hinds or physically interacts with a Siglec-9. The antibody may have nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen (e.g., Siglec-9). In certain embodiments, the Kd of the antibody is about 0.05 to about 100 nM. For example, Kd of the antibody is any of about 100 nM, about 50 nM, about 10 nM, about 1 nM, about 900 pM, about 800 pM, about 790 pM, about 780 pM, about 770 pM, about 760 pM, about 750 pM, about 740 pM, about 730 pM, about 720 pM, about 710 pM, about 700 pM, about 650 pM, about 600 pM, about 590 pM, about 580 pM, about 570 pM, about 560 pM, about 550 pM, about 540 pM, about 530 pM, about 520 pM, about 510 pM, about 500 pM, about 450 pM, about 400 pM, about 350 pM about 300 pM, about 290 pM, about 280 pM, about 270 pM, about 260 pM, about 250 pM, about 240 pM, about 230 pM, about 220 pM, about 210 pM, about 200 pM, about 150 pM, about 100 pM, or about 50 pM to any of about 2 pM, about 5 pM, about 10 pM, about 15 pM, about 20 pM, or about 40 pM. Methods for the preparation and selection of antibodies that interact and/or bind with specificity to a Siglec-9 are described herein.</p>In certain embodiments, an agent that decreases cellular levels of Siglec-9 and/or inhibits interaction between Siglec-9 and one or more Siglec-9 ligands comprises at least one antisense molecule capable of blocking or decreasing the expression of a functional Siglec-9 by targeting nucleic acids encoding a Siglec-9. Nucleic acid sequences of Siglec-9 are known in the art. For example, a human Siglec-9 can have a nucleic acid sequence as shown in NCBI Accession number NM_001198558.1 and a chimpanzee Siglec-9 can have a nucleic acid sequence as shown in NCBI Accession No. XM_003316566.3 and a mouse SIGLEC-E can h",
    "idate may be incubated with a known amount of immobilized Siglec-9 and a buffer. Subsequently, the immobilized Siglec-9 may be washed with a buffer and the immobilized Siglec-9 may be measured for the remaining presence of the radiolabeled Siglec-9 agent candidate using techniques known in the art, such as, for example, a gamma counter. A measurement indicating the presence of a radiolabeled substance may indicate the radiolabeled agent candidate is capable of interacting with and/or binding to Siglec-9.</p>In certain embodiments, an agent that interacts with a Siglec-9 may be identified using an optical technique. An exemplary optical technique to detect a Siglec-9 agent may include, e.g., attaching Siglec-9 to a colorimetric resonant grafting surface, thereby shifting the wavelength of reflected light due to changes in the optical path the light must take, and subsequently measuring additional changes in the wavelength of reflected light when a candidate agent is allowed to interact with Siglec-9. For example, no change in the measured wavelength of reflected light when an agent is incubated with Siglec-9 may indicate that the agent candidate is unable to interact with Siglec-9. Changes in the measured wavelength of reflected light when an agent candidate is incubated with Siglec-9 may indicate that the agent candidate is capable of binding and/or interacting with Siglec-9.</p>In certain embodiments, an agent that interacts with a Siglec-9 may be identified using a protein-binding assay. An exemplary protein-binding assay to detect a Siglec-9 agent may include, e.g., co-immunoprecipitation of a Siglec-9 in the presence of the agent candidate. For example, a Siglec-9 may be incubated with the agent candidate in buffer, and subsequently an immobilized molecule specific to capture a Siglec-9, such as, for example, an anti-Siglec-9 antibody, may be used to capture Siglec-9 in the presence of the agent candidate and bind the Siglec-9, potentially with an interacting agent candidate, during wash procedures known in the art. Subsequently, Siglec-9, potentially with an interacting agent candidate, can be released and the presence of an agent candidate may be detected, based on the agent candidate characteristics, by techniques, such as, for example, mass spectrometry and/or Western blot.</p>In certain embodiments, an agent that interacts with a Siglec-9 may be identified using a biochemical and/or an immunoassay assay well known in the art. An exemplary technique may include, e.g., an assay to quantitatively measure changes in Siglec-9 concentration and/or protein half-life using techniques, such as, for example, Western blot, immunostaining, and co-immunoprecipitation. For example, an agent candidate may be incubated with a sample containing a Siglec-9, such as a cell expressing Siglec-9, and subsequently Siglec-9 protein quantity and/or cellular levels may be measured at points during a time course study.

In some embodiments, the anti-Siglec-9 antibody is present in excess by an amount that ranges from about 1.5-fold to 100-fold, or greater than 100-fold compared to the amount of the one or more antibodies selected from 2D4, 2D5, 5B1, 6B2, 6D8, 7H12, 5C6, 12B12, 17C2, and any combination thereof. In some embodiments, the anti-Siglec-9 antibody is present in an amount that is about a 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, 5-fold, 6-fold, 7-fold, 8-fold, 9-fold, 10-fold, 15-fold, 20-fold, 25-fold, 30-fold, 35-fold, 40-fold, 45-fold, 50-fold, 55-fold, 60-fold, 65-fold, 70-fold, 75-fold, 80-fold, 85-fold, 90-fold, 95-fold, or 100-fold excess compared to the amount of the one or more antibodies selected from 2D4, 2D5, 5B1, 6B2, 6D8, 7H12, 5C6, 12B12, 17C2, and any combination thereof.</p>Any suitable competition assay or Siglec-9 binding assay known in the art, such as BIAcore analysis, ELISA assays, or flow cytometry, may be utilized to determine whether an anti-Siglec-9 antibody competes with one or more antibodies selected from 2D4, 2D5, 5B1, 6B2, 6D8, 7H12, 5C6, 12B 12, 17C2, and any combination thereof for binding to Siglec-9. In an exemplary competition assay, immobilized Siglec-9 or cells expressing Siglec-9 on the cell surface are incubated in a solution comprising a first labeled antibody that binds to Siglec-9 (e.g., human or non-human primate) and a second unlabeled antibody that is being tested for its ability to compete with the first antibody for binding to Siglec-9. The second antibody may be present in a hybridoma supernatant. As a control, immobilized Siglec-9 or cells expressing Siglec-9 is incubated in a solution comprising the first labeled antibody but not the second unlabeled antibody. After incubation under conditions permissive for binding of the first antibody to Siglec-9, excess unbound antibody is removed, and the amount of label associated with immobilized Siglec-9 or cells expressing Siglec-9 is measured. If the amount of label associated with immobilized Siglec-9 or cells expressing Siglec-9 is substantially reduced in the test sample relative to the control sample, then that indicates that the second antibody is competing with the first antibody for binding to Siglec-9.

In some embodiments, the antibody has a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) for human Siglec-9 that ranges from about 9 nM to about 230 pM, or less than 2300 pM. Dissociation constants may be determined through any analytical technique, including any biochemical or biophysical technique such as ELISA, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), bio-layer interferometry (see, e.g., Octet System by ForteBio), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), circular dichroism (CD), stopped-flow analysis, and colorimetric or fluorescent protein melting analyses.

    "yeloma cells. For example, if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT medium), which are substances that prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.</p>Preferred immortalized myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level production of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. Among these, preferred are murine myeloma lines, such as those derived from MOPC-21 and MPC-11 mouse tumors (available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif. USA), as well as SP-2 cells and derivatives thereof (e.g., X63-Ag8-653) (available from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va. USA). Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines have also been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor, J. Immunol., 133:3001 (1984); Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987)).</p>Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen (e.g., a Siglec-9 protein of the present disclosure). Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).</p>The culture medium in which the hybridoma cells are cultured can be assayed for the presence of monoclonal antibodies directed against the desired antigen (e.g., a Siglec-9 protein of the present disclosure). Preferably, the binding affinity and specificity of the monoclonal antibody can be determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked assay (ELISA). Such techniques and assays are known in the in art. For example, binding affinity may be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson et al., Anal. Biochem., 107:220 (1980).</p>After hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity, affinity, and/or activity, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (Goding, supra). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, D-MEM or RPMI-1640 medium. In addition, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as tumors in a mammal.</p>The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium, ascites fluid, or serum by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, affinity chromatography, and other methods as described above.</p>Anti-Siglec-9 monoclonal antibodies may also be made by recombinant DNA methods, such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567, and as described above. DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that specifically bind to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be plac",
    "e polymeric compositions which may be employed may be organic esters or ethers, which when degraded result in physiologically acceptable degradation products, including the monomers. Anhydrides, amides, orthoesters or the like, by themselves or in combination with other monomers, may find use. The polymers will be condensation polymers. The polymers may be cross-linked or non-cross-linked. Of particular interest are polymers of hydroxyaliphatic carboxylic acids, either homo- or copolymers, and polysaccharides. Included among the polyesters of interest are polymers of D-lactic acid, L-lactic acid, racemic lactic acid, glycolic acid, polycaprolactone, and combinations thereof. By employing the L-lactate or D-lactate, a slowly biodegrading polymer is achieved, while degradation is substantially enhanced with the racemate. Copolymers of glycolic and lactic acid are of particular interest, where the rate of biodegradation is controlled by the ratio of glycolic to lactic acid. The most rapidly degraded copolymer has roughly equal amounts of glycolic and lactic acid, where either homopolymer is more resistant to degradation. The ratio of glycolic acid to lactic acid will also affect the brittleness of in the implant, where a more flexible implant is desirable for larger geometries. Among the polysaccharides of interest are calcium alginate, and functionalized celluloses, particularly carboxymethylcellulose esters characterized by being water insoluble, a molecular weight of about 5 kD to 500 kD, etc. Biodegradable hydrogels may also be employed in the implants of the present disclosure. Hydrogels are typically a copolymer material, characterized by the ability to imbibe a liquid. Exemplary biodegradable hydrogels which may be employed are described in Heller in: Hydrogels in Medicine and Pharmacy, N. A. Peppes ed., Vol. 1I1, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla., 1987, pp 137-149.</p>Pharmaceutical Dosages</p>Pharmaceutical compositions of the present disclosure containing a Siglec-9 agent of the present disclosure, such as an anti-Siglec-9 antibody of the present disclosure, may be administered to an individual in need of treatment with the Siglec-9 agent, preferably a human, in accord with known methods, such as intravenous administration as a bolus or by continuous infusion over a period of time, by intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intracerobrospinal, intracranial, intraspinal, subcutaneous, intra-articular, intrasynovial, intrathecal, oral, topical, or inhalation routes.</p>Dosages and desired drug concentration of pharmaceutical compositions of the present disclosure may vary depending on the particular use envisioned. The determination of the appropriate dosage or route of administration is well within the skill of an ordinary artisan. Animal experiments provide reliable guidance for the determination of effective doses for human therapy.

Antibodies from different species share characteristic sequence and structural features that allow the grafting of the specificity-determining regions (SDRs) of the non-human antibody onto a human antibody framework. This results in retention of the specificity of the non-human antibody. The humanization process involves identification of the non-human antibody sequence and features, including the framework regions and SDRs. The following criteria are used to humanize an antibody: 1) percent similarity in framework regions between non-human and known human antibodies, 2) length similarity in SDRs between non-human and known human antibodies, 3) genes used to generate the fram"
