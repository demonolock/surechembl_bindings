    "und of choosing is that molecular weight is that 349.35 Maybridge company is at one of the compound of selling (CAS Registry No.218156-96-8).But, about the inhibition of phosphorylase so far without any report.We are by its called after SRPIN-1 (SRPK inhibitor-1).</p>The synthetic RS peptide (NH2-RSPSYGRSRSRSRSRSRSRSRSNSRSRSY-OH) (serial number 5) that is equivalent to the RS domain of SF2 of research that [embodiment 4B] used the phosphorylation activity of the SRPK1 of SRPIN-1 to suppress.Used 10mM Tris-HCl (pH7.5) to dissolve, made to become 1mg/ml.With the restructuring SRPK1 protein of 1 \u03bc g expression and purification in coliform, at reaction buffer (250 \u03bc MMgCl\n        <sub>2</sub>, 0.25mM ATP, 1mCi[\u03b3-\n        <sup>32</sup>p] ATP, SRPIN-1 final concentration 0.1,0.3,1.0,3.0,10.0 \u03bc M) in the water-bath of 30 \u2103, cultivate 10 minutes.The amount of the SRPK1 of this phosphorylase determination of activity and RS peptide and the condition in response time are to study in advance the rectilinearity of reaction, the condition of having selected rectilinearity to set up.\n      </p>The reaction of SRPK1 and RS peptide was carried out after 10 minutes, and reactant liquor is dropped to P81 cellulose phosphate thin film (P81; Whatman), with 5% phosphoric acid solution washing.After washing, by liquid flashing counter measuring P81 thin film\n        <sup>32</sup>the radioactivity of P.Result as shown in Figure 4 B.\n      </p>As a result, SRPIN-1 is about 400nM with respect to the IC50 of SRPK1.By same method, studied CLK1, CLK2, CLK3, CLK4, SRPK2, PRP4, PKA, PKC in addition, even because final concentration is that 10 \u03bc M also have no inhibition, therefore can say that SRPIN-1 is the specificity enzyme inhibitor of SRPK1.</p>[embodiment 4C] is to the inhibition of SR protein phosphorylation in the body of use SRPIN-1 and follow its SR protein to decompose the research of inducing</p>In Flp-In293 cell, import HA-SRp75 plasmid (1.0 \u03bc g), after 36 hours, add respectively MG132 (final concentration 10 \u03bc M), SRPIN-1 (10,20,50 \u03bc M) and cultivate 15 hours.Then, with SDS-PAGE sample-loading buffer dissolved cell, as protein example.This sample is carried out to SDS-PAGE, with anti-HA antibody, carry out western blot analysis.As the contrast of albumen quality, use anti-beta-actin antibody to carry out western blot analysis.The results are shown in Fig. 4 C.</p>As a result, weaken HA antibody signal SRPIN-1 concentration dependent.This shows that the active SRPIN-1 dependency of endogenic SRPK1 ground is suppressed, and result has been decomposed SRp75 protein.</p>This explanation SRPIN-1 can suppress the phosphorylation of SR protein in vivo to the inhibition of SRPK1, and result makes SR protein unstable, has promoted protein decomposition.</p>The research of the inhibition that the interpolation of [embodiment 4D] SRPIN-1 is infected HIV</p>In MT-4 cell, add the HIV virion of preparing with 293T cell, carry out infection experiment.First, when preparing liq"
