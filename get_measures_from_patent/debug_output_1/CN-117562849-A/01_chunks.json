    ", a certain acne mark removing effect can be achieved by means of an acne removing or acne mark removing skin care product. However, most of acne mark repairing products sold in the market have insufficient repairing effect, long skin recovery period and poor recovery effect, and cannot fundamentally solve the problem of acne marks.</p>Disclosure of Invention</p>The invention aims at providing a composition with a acne mark repairing effect.</p>Still another object of the present invention is: a method for preparing a composition with acne mark repairing effect is provided.</p>The invention aims at realizing the following scheme: a composition with acne mark repairing effect is characterized in that components such as fibronectin, bioactive peptides, plant extracts and the like are selected to realize the effects of inhibiting bacteria, resisting inflammation, relieving acne muscles, deeply repairing and refining skin.</p>The composition with the acne mark repairing effect comprises the following components in parts by mass:</p>fibronectin: 0.05 to 2 percent;</p>bioactive peptide: 0.002% -0.01%;</p>plant extracts: 1% -10%;</p>humectant: 0.1 to 8 percent;</p>antioxidant: 0.3 to 1.5 percent;</p>preservative: 0.4 to 0.9 percent;</p>and (3) a thickening agent: 0.2 to 0.6 percent;</p>pH regulator: 0.1 to 0.2 percent;</p>water: the balance.</p>The fibronectin is a compound mixture of human fibronectin, trehalose and mannitol, and the molecular weight of the fibronectin is about 30 Kd.</p>Further, the bioactive peptide is at least one of oligopeptide-1, oligopeptide-3 and carnosine.</p>Further the plant extract comprises bletilla striata root extract, cynanchum atratum extract, centella asiatica extract, sophora flavescens root extract and aster ageratoides extract;</p>the humectant is at least one of glycerol, butanediol, propylene glycol, 1, 2-pentanediol, hyaluronic acid, mannitol, allantoin and D-panthenol;</p>further, the hyaluronic acid is at least one selected from macromolecular hyaluronic acid, medium-molecular hyaluronic acid and low-molecular hyaluronic acid;</p>further, the antioxidant is at least one of ergothioneine, madecassoside, tetrahydromethylpyrimidic acid and nicotinamide;</p>further, the preservative is at least one of p-hydroxyacetophenone, 1, 2-hexanediol and octanoyl hydroxamic acid;</p>further the thickener is at least one of carbomer, xanthan gum, hydroxyethyl cellulose and ammonium acryloyldimethyl taurate/VP copolymer;</p>further, the pH regulator is at least one of aminomethylpropanol, triethanolamine, arginine and citric acid.</p>The application also provides a preparation method of the composition with the acne mark repairing effect, which comprises the following preparation steps:</p>step one: weighing the components according to the mass ratio for standby;</p>step two: adding a part of humectant and thickener into an emulsifying pot, starting stirring, heating to 80-85 \u2103, maintaining stirring for 20min until the raw mat"
