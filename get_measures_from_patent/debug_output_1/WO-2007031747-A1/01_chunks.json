Compounds of general formula (XIV) are commercially available or can be prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art.</p>\n  Biological Methods</p>\n  Compounds of the invention can be tested using the following biological test methods to determine their ability to displace PGD<sub>2</sub> from the CRTH2 receptor and for their ability to antagonise the functional effects of PGD<sub>2</sub> at the CRTH2 receptor in a whole cell system.</p>\n  Radioligand Binding Assay \n\nThe receptor binding assay is performed in a final volume of 200 \u03bcl_ binding buffer [10 mM BES (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM manganese chloride, 0.01 % BSA] and 1 nM [<sup>3</sup>H]-PGD<sub>2</sub> (Amersham Biosciences UK Ltd). Ligands are added in assay buffer containing a constant amount of DMSO (1 % by volume). Total binding is determined using 1 % by volume of DMSO in assay buffer and non-specific binding is determined using 10 \u03bcM of unlabeled PGD<sub>2</sub> (Sigma). Human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell membranes (3.5 \u03bcg) expressing the CRTH2 receptor are incubated with 1.5 mg wheatgerm agglutinin SPA beads and 1 nM [<sup>3</sup>H]-PGD<sub>2</sub> (Amersham Biosciences UK Ltd) and the mixture incubated for 3 hours at room temperature. Bound [<sup>3</sup>H]-PGD<sub>2</sub>Js detected using a Microbeta TRILUX liquid scintillation counter (Perkin Elmer).</p>\n  Compound IC<sub>50</sub> value is determined using a 6-point dose response curve in duplicate with a semi-log compound dilution series. IC<sub>50</sub> calculations are performed using Excel and XLfit (Microsoft), and this value is used to determine a Ki value for the test compound using the Cheng-Prusoff equation.</p>\n  Functional Assays</p>\n  GTP\u038eS Assay</p>\n  The GTP\u03b3S Assay is performed in a final volume of 200 mL assay buffer (2OmM HEPES pH 7.4, 1OmM MgCI<sub>2</sub>, 10OmM NaCI, 10\u03bcg/mL saponin). DMSO concentrations are kept constant at 1% by volume. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell membranes (3.5 \u03bcg) expressing the CRTH2 receptor are incubated with the compounds for 15 min at 30\u00b0 C prior to addition of PGD<sub>2</sub> (3OnM final concentration) and GTP (10\u03bcM final concentration). The assay solutions are then incubated for 30 minutes at 30\u00b0 C, followed by addition of [<sup>35</sup>S]-GTPyS (0.1 nM final concentration). The assay plate is than shaken and incubated for 5 minutes at 3O<sup>0</sup>C. Finally, SPA beads (Amersham Biosciences, UK) are added to a final concentration of 1.5mg/well and the plate shaken and incubated for 30 minute at 30\u00b0 C. The sealed plate is centrif uged at 100Og for 10mins at 30oC and the bound [<sup>35</sup>S]-GTP\u03b3S is detected on Microbeta scintillation counter (Perkin Elmer). Compound IC<sub>50</sub> value is determined using a 6-point dose response curve in duplicate with a semi-log compound dilution series. IC<sub>50</sub> calculations are performed using Excel and XLfit (Microsoft), and this value is used to determine a Ki value for the test compound using the Cheng-Prusoff equation. \n\nCalcium mobilisation assay</p>\n  Stable CHO-K1 cells co-expressing the CRTH2 receptor and the G-protein G\u03b116 are seeded (40,000 cells per well in a plating volume of 75 \u03bcl_ in F-12 Hams supplemented with 1 % foetal bovine serum) into collagen-coated 96-well plates 24 hours prior to the assay. The cells are then loaded with a fluorescence-imaging plate reader (FLIPR) calcium kit dye (Calcium 3 kit, Molecular Devices Ltd) containing 5 mM final concentration of probenecid and incubated at 37 <sup>0</sup>C for 1 hour in a 5 % CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. The fluorescence emission caused by intracellular calcium mobilization elicited by the PGD<sub>2</sub> at the CRTH2 receptor is determined with a FLEXstation benchtop scanning and integrated fluid transfer workstation (Molecular Devices Ltd). To detect antagonists and determine compound IC<sub>50</sub>, compounds are pre-incubated at varying concentrations with the loaded cells for 15 minutes at 37 <sup>0</sup>C, 5 % CO<sub>2</sub>, prior to the addition of the agonist at its EC<sub>80</sub> value. Compounds and agonist are added in Hanks balanced salt solution containing 20 mM HEPES and 0.1 % BSA). The fractional response values for each well are calculated by subtracting the basal response from the peak response. Results are calculated as the mean of triplicate wells using Excel and XLfit (Microsoft).</p>\n  Eosinophil Chemotaxis Assay</p>\n  Eosinophils chemotaxis ",
