    "o robustly produce DE (D'Amour, K. et al., Nature Biotechnology 23, 1534-1541, (2005)). Step 2 comprised 2 days differentiation in RPMI with 2% FBS containing FGF10 (50 ng/mL) and KAAD-cyclopamine (0.5 \u03bcM). Step 3 comprised 4 days differentiation in CMRL with B27 supplement (1:100) containing FGF10 (50 ng/mL), KAAD-cyclopamine (0.2 \u03bcM), and retinoic acid (1 \u03bcM). The fourth step comprised 2 days treatment with CMRL with B27 supplement (1:100) containing exendin 4 (40 ng/mL) and with varying concentrations of the gamma secretase inhibitor DAPT (0 \u03bcM, 1 \u03bcM, 3 \u03bcM, or 10 \u03bcM). The last step comprised 6 days differentiation in DMEM with B27 supplement (1:100) containing nicotinamide (10 mM), exendin 4 (40 ng/mL), and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 (50 ng/mL). Duplicate samples were taken from each plate and gene expression was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR.</p>Following production of high levels of PDX1 protein in accordance with the temporal application of factors and medium conditions described above, a final step to endocrine hormone production was addition of a gamma secretase inhibitor. The gamma secretase inhibitor promoted the transient induction of the transcription factor NGN3. It is known that the gamma secretase inhibitor efficiently blocks enzymatic release of the Notch intracellular domain, and thus, also functions as an inhibitor of Notch pathway activity (Notch inbitior). Application of any of the standard gamma secretase inhibitors in the range of their KD's results in Notch inhibition as measured by inhibition of expression of the Notch target genes such as HES1. As shown in FIGS. 6A-6F, very little to no insulin, glucagon, somatostatin or principal pancreatic transcription factors were produced in the absence of DAPT. It is beneficial to provide gamma secretase inhibition or Notch inhibition for a short interval after or during the retinoic acid differentiation step.</p>Example 7Definitive Endoderm can be Differentiated Through a Sequential Series of Steps in Order to Achieve Endocrine Hormone ExpressionHuman embryonic stem cells were differentiated for 16 days via either a 4-step or 5-step protocol to achieve islet hormone-expressing cells. The first step comprised 3 days differentiation in activin A (100 ng/mL) to robustly produce DE (D'Amour, K. et al., Nature Biotechnology 23, 1534-1541, (2005)). Step 2 comprised 3 days differentiation in RPMI with 2% FBS containing FGF10 (50 ng/mL) and KAAD-cyclopamine (0.2 \u03bcM). In the 4-step protocol, step 3 comprised 4 days differentiation in CMRL with B27 supplement (1:100) containing FGF10 (50 ng/mL), KAAD-cyclopamine (0.2 \u03bcM), retinoic acid (2 \u03bcM), and DAPT (1 \u03bcM). In the 5-step protocol, this 4 day period was broken into two separate treatments in the same base media. For 2 days the media contained FGF10 (50 ng/mL), KAAD-cyclopamine (0.2 \u03bcM), and retinoic acid (2 \u03bcM). During the subsequent 2 days, the FGF10 was removed and the gamma-secretase inhibitor DAPT (1 \u03bcM) was added. The"
