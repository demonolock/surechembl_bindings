(B) The dataset GSE22226 from the ISPY-1 trial was used to compare the TN score and pCR in the prediction of ER<sup>\"</sup> patient survival after neoadjuvant chemotherapy as this dataset also recorded RFS. pCR strongly associated with RFS (first panel) as previously reported, the TN score (next three panel) was not only predictive of survival in the these patients but could \n\n also stratified the survival of patients achieving or not achieving pCR, indicated the TN score as an independent prognostic factor for pCR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. </p> Figure 24: Drug sensitivity of cancer cell lines according to the TN score. The large published study by Garnett et al. was investigated where the TN score was calculated for each cell line in the study as described in Methods. The cell lines were classified as high or low TN score according to the median TN score to compare the sensitivity of low TN score cell lines (white boxes) and high TN score cell lines (red boxes). Graphs were prepared using GraphPad<sup>\u00ae</sup> Prism showing sensitivity as - logl0[IC50] in boxes (with median marked by a line) and whiskers (marking the 1st and 3rd quartiles and outliers as dots according to Tukey method for plotting the whiskers and outliers). Unpaired two-tailed t test was used for statistical analysis. Figure 25: The iBCR score stratifies the survival of all breast cancer patients irrespective of ER status in the ROCK dataset. The TN and Agro scores were calculated for each tumor in the ROCK dataset (n=1570, Affymetrix) and then the iBCR score was calculated as the TN score to the power of the Agro score. The RFS of all patients and the RFS of ER- or ER+ patients only was compared between high score and low score by dichotomy across the median score for each of the scores. The iBCR score was prognostic in all patients as well as ER- and ER+ subsets with better separation between low score and high score tumors (increased hazard ratio [HR] and limits of the 95% confidence intervals and decreased log rank p-value). Graphs and the univariate survival analysis using the log rank test were performed using GraphPad<sup>\u00ae</sup> Prism. </p> Figure 26: The iBCR score stratifies the survival of all breast cancer patients irrespective of ER status in the TCGA dataset. The TN. Agro and the iBCR scores were calculated for each tumor in the TCGA dataset (n=1106, Illumina RNA-Seq). The RFS of all patients and the RFS of ER- or ER+ patients only was compared between high score and low score. As in the results in the ROCK dataset in Figure 7, The iBCR",
    "fferences based on unpaired two-tailed \u03af-test performed using GraphPad<sup>\u00ae</sup> Prism. As this analysis was also done for the TN score (Figure 35), results from analysis of the Agro score are also shown in the top row. </p>Figure 43: High copy number variations (CNVs) in high Agro score tumors compared to low Agro score tumors. The breast cancer tumors in the TCGA dataset were classified as high or low for the Agro score based on the gene expression data (Illumina HiSeq RNA-seq). (A) The TCGA copy number variations (segmented and after deletion of germline CNV) were visualized using the UCSC Genome Browser to compare patients who were classified from gene expression data as high Agro score patients (top panel) to those classified as low Agro score patients (bottom panel). (B) Presentation of the distribution of clinical indicators such as ER, PR and HER2 status and others. (C) The difference in the CNVs profile of high Agro score patients to the low Agro score patients showing gains (red) and losses (green) of whole chromosome arms in the high Agro score patients, suggesting aneuploidy. Figure 44: High Agro and iBCR score cell lines are more sensitive to Aurora kinase inhibitors. Two studies which treated breast cancer cell lines with Aurora kinase inhibitors were analyzed based on the Agro, TN and the iBCR score for these cell lines. As shown in Figure, high Agro score and particularly high iBCR score cell lines were more sensitive to Aurora kinase inhibitors (ENMD-2076: IC50 1.4 \u03bc\u039c vs. 5.9 \u03bc\u039c for high vs. low iBCR Score cell lines, p=0.0125 f-test; AMG 900: IC50 0.3 nM vs. 0.7 nM for high vs. low iBCR score cell lines, p=0.0308 t-test). </p> Figure 45: The iBCR is prognostic in the pan-cancer TCGA data for overall and relapse-free survival. The pan-cancer TCGA data were analyzed for the iBCR gene signature using the UCSC Genome Browser and the data for this signature, survival data and cancer types were downloaded from the browser. Tumors, irrespective of cancer types, were classified into quartiles based on the iBCR signature expression and the overall and relapse free survival were compared across these quartiles. As shown in the top row, overall and relapse-free survival was stratified by the iBCR signature in this pan-cancer dataset. In the far right panel in the top row, the distribution of tumors in each cancer type across the iBCR signature quartile is \n\n shown. Cervical cancer for example displays high iBCR signature in the majority of cases whereas on the opposite side, thyroid cancer displays low iBCR signature in all the cases. The lower panels show the stratification of overall survival according to the iBCR score from the pan-cancer dataset where the stratification was statistically significant in log-rank univariate survival analysis. In addition to the breast cancer data shown in paper, the iBCR signature was prognostic in adrenocortical cancer, endometrioid cancer, kidney clear cell cancer, bladder cancer, lower grade glioma and melanoma. The iBCR was also prognostic in lung adenocarcinoma as shown in Figure 46. ",
    "o investigate overall survival of lung adenocarcinoma (A) and squamous cell carcinoma (B). The iBCR signature shows a strong prognostic value in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). (C) Multivariate survival analysis was performed in KM-Plotter for the iBCR signature in lung cancer in comparison to available clinical indicators; histological type (lung adenocarcinoma vs. small cell lung cancer) and stage of disease. The iBCR signature outperformed these standard clinical indicators. (D&amp;E) The TCGA data for LUAD (Illumina HiSeq RNA-seq data) were stratified by quartiles or tertiles for the iBCR signature expression to test the association of the iBCR signature with overall survival (D) and relapse-free survival (E), respectively. LUAD patients with high iBCR signature had poorest survival and suffered earlier recurrence and death compared to patients with lower iBCR signature expression. It should be noted that the TCGA data for squamous cell lung carcinoma were also investigated and there was no statistical significance for the association of the iBCR signature and survival, in agreement with the very weak association seen from the KM-Plotter data. </p>Figure 47: The sensitivity of breast cancer cell lines treated with 24 drugs according to the iBCR score. Breast cancer cell lines (10 cell lines) were cultured in the absence or presence of escalating doses of 24 small molecular anti-cancer drugs. This published study was re-analyzed to compare the sensitivity (calculated as the - logIC50) between high iBCR score cell lines (5 cell lines: BT-549, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-468 and BT-20) to low iBCR score cell lines (5 cell lines: Hs.578T, BT-474, MCF-7, T-47D, and ZR-75-1). The iBCR scores were calculated from the Agro and TN scores using the published gene expression dataset for 51 \n\n breast cancer cell lines (Neve et al, Cancer Cell, 2006). High iBCR score cell lines (red bars) were more sensitive than low iBCR score cell lines (white bars) to 13 drugs (shaded in grey) targeting 9 different kinases. Statistical comparison was performed in GraphPad<sup>\u00ae</sup> Prism using two tailed unpaired i-test. </p>Figure 48: Proteins and phosphoproteins associated with the iBCR mRNA gene signature. The iBCR score based on the mRNA expression of the 43 genes was used to stratify the patients in the TCGA breast cancer dataset as low, intermediate or high iBCR score. The reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA) from the TCGA breast cancer dataset (n=747 patients) were then compared between the three groups of patients according to the iBCR mRNA signature. (A) Overall survival of ER+ patients according to the iBCR mRNA signature. (B) Significantly up- or down-regulated proteins and phosphoproteins in ER+ patients in the low, intermediate and high iBCR score groups.

    "rm) and the ISPY-I trial dataset (GSE22226 [41, 46], Agilent platform), illustrating the platform-independence of the iBCR score which i driven by the platform independence of tire Agro and TN signatures as they were discovered from meta-analysis irrespective of array platforms used from independent studies, Mining drug screen studies </p> Two large studies which treated large panels of cancer cell lines with large panels of anticancer drugs were investigated to determine whether cell lines with high Agro, TN or iBCR score show different sensitivity to particular anticancer drug in comparison to cancer cell lines with low Agro, TN or iBCR scores. Briefly, the datasets of gene expression profiling from Genentech (niRNA Cancer Cell Line Profile GSE10843), Pfizer (Pfizer Molecular Profile Data for Cell Line GSE342 1) and Broad Institute/Novartis (Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia [COLE] GSE3613) \n\n were obtained from GEO and imported into ArrayTools as described earlier. The Agro, TN and iBCR scores for all the cell lines profiled were calculated and cell lines were assigned as high or low for each of the scores based on dichotomy across the media in each dataset. For cell lines which were profiled in more than one dataset, the average scores were used. Usin this data, the sensitivity of cancer cell line with high and low Agro, TN or iBCR scores was compared to those with low score to anticancer drugs was investigated in two studies [49, 50]. Drugs which had significantly different IC50 in high score cell lines compared to low score cell lines are described herein. Statistical significance was detennined from unpaired two- tailed t-test using GraphPad*<sup>'</sup> Prism. </p>Other statistical analysis </p> Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed using MedCalc for Windows, version 12.7 (MedCalc Software, Qstend, Belgium), </p>Results </p> Meta-analysi of gene expression profile in Oneomim\u2122 </p> We performed a meta-analysis of published gene expression data, irrespective of platform or breast cancer subtype, using the Oncomine <sup>\"</sup> database [37] (version 4,5). We were able to compared the expression profiles of primary breast tumors from 512 patients who developed metastases vs. 732 patient who did not develop metastases at 5 years (7 datasets in total) to identify 500 overexpressed genes and 500 underexpressed genes in the metastasis cases (cutoff median p- value across the dataset &lt; 0.05 from, a Student's /-test. Figure 1). We also compared the expression profiles of 232 primary breast tumors from patients who died within 5 years vs. 87 patients who survived in 7 datasets and found 500 overexpressed genes and 500 underexpressed genes in the poor survivors (cutoff median p-yalue across the datasets &lt; 0.05 from a Student's /-test, Figure 31). Since several datasets were annotated for one of these outcomes but not both, we rationalized that the union of these analyses is more appropriate particu",
    "y to inhibition of RSK (CMI), MEK (PD0325901) and DNA damage (Bleomycin). Similar to results from high TN score, high iBC score cell lines were also less sensitive to the inhibition of PARP (ABT- 888 and AZD-2281), retinoic acid (ATRA), Bcl2 (ABT-263), DHFR (methotrexate) and glucose (metformin). Additionally, high iBCR score cell line were less sensitive to inhibition of SYK (\u0392\u0391\u03a56\u03933606), HDAC (Vorinostat) and BCR-ABL (Nilotinib) \n\n and p38MAPK (BIRB 0796). High Agro score cell lines were les sensitive to an additional drug against GSK3A/B (SB216763). Altogether, the TN score (Figure 24 and 35) and the Agro score and the combined iBCR score (Figure 30 and 42) associate with sensitivit to several anticancer drugs and future experimental validation would establi h these scores as companion diagnostic for these drugs and benefit breast cancer patients by directing these drugs to the high score patients with poor survival. </p> Sensitivity of breast cancer cell lines to targeted inhibitors according to the iBCR scor </p>Breast cancer cell lines (10 cell lines); BT-549, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-468, BT-20, Hs.578T, BT-474, MCF-7, T-47D, and ZR-75-1, were cultured in the absence or presence of escalating doses of 24 anti-cancer drugs. The survival of cells was determined six days in compari son to untreated cell usin the MTS/MTA assay. The response of the cell lines to the drugs was analyzed in GraphPad<sup>5i</sup> Prism using a dose response curve to calculate the logu; of IC50 (1C50 i the dose required to kill 50% of the cells). Sensitivity was presented as the - l\u00a9gio[IC5QL This dru screen which we published previousl (Al-Ejeh et al, On target, 2014) was re-analyzed according to the iBCR score. The gene expression datasets of 51 breast cancer cell lines by Neve et al. (Cancer Cell, 2006), was analyzed to calculate the Agro and TN scores for each cell line to calculate the iBCR score. Each cell line wa assigned as low of high iBCR score by dichotomy across the median of all the cell lines in the Neve et al. dataset. Based o the low or high iBCR score classification, the sensitivity of the 10 cell lines used in our screen wa compared between high iBCR score cell lines (5 cell lines) to low iBCR score cell line (5 cell lines). As shown in Figure 47, high iBCR score cell lines were significantly more sensitive to the- inhibition of p38MAPK (LY222882Q), PLCu (IJ73122), JNK (SP600125), PAKl (IPA3), MEK (AS703026 and AZD6244), ER 5 (XMD 8-92 and BIXG2188), HSP90 (17-AAG, PF04291 3 and AUY922), IGF1R (GS 1904529A) and EGFR (Afatinib). The results from our screen are in agreement with the higher sensitivity of high iBCR score cancer cell lines to HSP90, IGF1R and MEK inhibitors we identified from the two previously published large cell line studies. </p>Discussion \n\n Our meta-analysis of gene expression datasets in the Oncomine<sup>1</sup> database has previously identified a signature, the Aggressivenes signature (Agra signature), which was prognosti",
