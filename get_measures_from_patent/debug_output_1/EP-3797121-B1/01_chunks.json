    "moieties of saccharides, phosphoryl groups, or sulfonyl groups on the antigen.</p><p id=\"p0072\" num=\"0072\">The term \"antigenic epitope\" as used herein, is defined as a portion of a polypeptide to which an antibody can specifically bind as determined by any method well known in the art, for example, by conventional immunoassays. A \"nonlinear epitope\" or \"conformational epitope\" comprises noncontiguous polypeptides (or amino acids) within the antigenic protein to which an antibody specific to the epitope binds. Once a desired epitope on an antigen is determined, it is possible to generate antibodies to that epitope, e.g., using the techniques described herein.</p><p id=\"p0073\" num=\"0073\">The terms \"specific binding\" or \"specifically binding\" when used in reference to the interaction of an antibody and a protein or peptide refers to an interaction that is dependent upon the presence of a particular structure (i.e., the antigenic<!-- EPO <DP n=\"26\"> --> determinant or epitope) on the protein; in other words the antibody is recognizing and binding to a specific protein structure rather than to proteins in general. For example, if an antibody is specific for epitope \"A,\" the presence of a protein containing epitope A (or free, unlabeled A) in a reaction containing labeled \"A\" and the antibody will reduce the amount of labeled A bound to the antibody.</p><p id=\"p0074\" num=\"0074\">In certain embodiments \"specifically binds\" means, for instance, that an antibody binds a protein with a KD of about 0.1 nM or less, but more usually less than about 1\u00b5M. In certain embodiments, \"specifically binds\" means that an antibody binds a target at times with a KD of at least about 0.1 \u00b5M or less, at other times at least about 0.01\u00b5M or less, and at other times at least about 1 nM or less. Because of the sequence identity between homologous proteins in different species, specific binding can include an antibody that recognizes a protein in more than one species (e.g., human protein or mouse protein). Likewise, because of homology within certain regions of polypeptide sequences of different proteins, specific binding can include an antibody that recognizes more than one protein. It is understood that, in certain embodiments, an antibody or binding moiety that specifically binds a first target may or may not specifically bind a second target. As such, \"specific binding\" does not necessarily require (although it can include) exclusive binding, i.e. binding to a single target. Thus, an antibody may, in some embodiments, specifically bind more than one target. In certain embodiments, multiple targets may be bound by the same antigen-binding site on the antibody. For example, an antibody may, in certain instances, comprise two identical antigen-binding sites, each of which specifically binds the same epitope on two or more proteins. In certain alternative embodiments, an antibody may be multispecific and comprise at least two antigen-binding sites with differing specificities. By way of non-limiting example, a bispecific antibody may comprise one antigen-binding site that recognizes an epitope on one protein (e.g., human CD3) and further ",
    " epitope on a second protein. Generally, but not necessarily, reference to binding means specific binding.</p><p id=\"p0075\" num=\"0075\">An antibody that specifically binds to an antigen may bind to other peptides or polypeptides with lower affinity as determined by assays known in the art e.g.<!-- EPO <DP n=\"27\"> --> immunoassays, BIACORE<sup>\u00ae</sup>, or other assays. Preferably, the antibody that specifically binds an antigen does not cross-react with other proteins.</p><p id=\"p0076\" num=\"0076\">The terms \"non-specific binding\" or \"background binding\" when used in reference to the interaction of an antibody and a protein or peptide refers to an interaction that is not dependent on the presence of a particular structure (i.e., the antibody is binding to proteins in general rather that a particular structure such as an epitope).</p><p id=\"p0077\" num=\"0077\">The term \"k<sub>on</sub>\" or \"k<sub>a</sub>,\" as used herein, refers to the rate constant for association of an antibody to an antigen. Specifically, the rate constants (k<sub>on</sub>/k<sub>a</sub> and k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>d</sub>) and equilibrium dissociation constants are measured using whole antibody (i.e., bivalent) and monomeric CD3 proteins.</p><p id=\"p0078\" num=\"0078\">The term \"k<sub>off</sub>\" or \"k<sub>d</sub>,\" as used herein, refers to the rate constant for dissociation of an antibody from the antibody/antigen complex.</p><p id=\"p0079\" num=\"0079\">The term \"K<sub>D</sub>,\" as used herein, refers to the equilibrium dissociation constant of an antibody-antigen interaction.</p><p id=\"p0080\" num=\"0080\">As used herein, the term \"binding affinity,\" generally refers to the strength of the sum total of noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g., an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, \"binding affinity\" refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1:1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., antibody and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (Kd). For example, the Kd can be about 200 nM, 150 nM, 100 nM, 60 nM, 50 nM, 40 nM, 30 nM, 20 nM, 10 nM, 8 nM, 6 nM, 4 nM, 2 nM, 1 nM, or stronger. Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art, including those described herein. Low-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to dissociate readily, whereas high-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain bound longer. A variety of methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art, any of which can be used for purposes of the present invention. In particular, the term \"binding affinity\"<!-- EPO <DP n=\"28\"> --> is intended to refer to the dissociation rate of a particular antigen-antibody interaction. The K<sub>D</sub> is the ratio of the rate of dissociation, also called the \"off-rate (k<sub>off</sub>),\" to the association rate, or \"on- rate (k<sub>on</sub>)\". Thus, K<sub>D</sub> equals k<sub>off</sub> / k<sub>on</sub> and is expressed as a molar concentration (M). It follows that the smaller the K<sub>D</sub>, the stronger the affinity of binding. Therefore, a K<sub>D</sub> of 1 \u00b5M indicates weak binding affinity compared to a K<sub>D</sub> of 1 nM. K<sub>D</sub> values for antibodies can be determined using methods well established in the art. One method for determining the K<sub>D</sub> of an antibody is by using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), typically using a biosensor system such as a BIACORE<sup>\u2122</sup> system. BIACORE<sup>\u2122</sup> kinetic analysis comprises analyzing the binding",
    "ible to competitively screen antibodies for binding to the same epitope. An approach to achieve this is to conduct competition and cross-competition studies to find antibodies that compete or cross-compete with one another e.g., the antibodies compete for binding to the antigen. One method is to identify the epitope to which antibodies bind, or \"epitope mapping\". There are many methods known in the art for mapping and characterizing the location of epitopes on proteins, including solving the crystal structure of an antibody-antigen complex, competition assays, gene fragment expression assays, and synthetic peptide-based assays, as described, for example, in <nplcit id=\"ncit0075\" npl-type=\"b\"><text>Chapter 11 of Harlow and Lane, Using Antibodies, a Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1999</text></nplcit>. In an additional example, epitope mapping can be used to determine the sequence to which an antibody binds. Epitope mapping is commercially available from various sources, for example, Pepscan Systems (Edelhertweg 15, 8219 PH Lelystad, The Netherlands). In an additional example, mutagenesis of an antigen binding domain, domain swapping experiments and alanine scanning mutagenesis can be performed to identify residues required, sufficient, and/or necessary for epitope binding. The binding affinity and the off-rate of an antigen-binding domain interaction can be determined by competitive binding assays. One example of a competitive binding assay is a radioimmunoassay comprising the incubation of labeled antigen, and the detection of the molecule bound to the labeled antigen. The affinity of the molecule of the present invention for an antigen and the binding off-rates can be determined from the saturation data by Scatchard analysis.</p><p id=\"p0151\" num=\"0151\">The affinities and binding properties of the antibodies of the present invention for an antigen may be initially determined using in vitro assays (biochemical or immunological based assays) known in the art for antigen-binding domain, including but not limited to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay, surface<!-- EPO <DP n=\"50\"> --> plasmon resonance (SPR) assay, Bio-Layer Interferometry, or immunoprecipitation assays. The molecules of the invention may have similar binding properties in vivo models (such as those described and disclosed herein) as those in in vitro based assays.

Biotinylated or Fc fusion human CD3 can be diluted into HBS-EP buffer to a concentration of less than 0.5 \u00b5g/mL and injected across the individual chip channels using variable contact times, to achieve two ranges of antigen density, either 50-200 response units (RU) for detailed kinetic studies or 800-1,000 RU for screening assays. Regeneration studies have shown that 25 mM NaOH in 25% v/v ethanol effectively removes the bound Fab while keeping the activity of CD3 on the chip for over 200 injections. Typically, serial dilutions (spanning concentrations of 0.1-10x estimated K<sub>D</sub>) of purified Fab samples<!-- EPO <DP n=\"80\"> --> are injected for 1 min at 100 \u00b5L/minute and dissociation times of up to 2 hours are allowed. The concentrations of the Fab proteins are determined by ELISA and/or SDS-PAGE electrophoresis using a Fab of known concentration (as determined by amino acid analysis) as a standard. Kinetic association rates (k<sub>on</sub>) and dissociation rates (k<sub>off</sub>) are obtained simultaneously by fitting the data globally to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model (<nplcit id=\"ncit0086\" npl-type=\"s\"><text>Karlsson, R.

Equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) values are calculated as k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>. This protocol is suitable for use in determining binding affinity of an antibody to any CD3, including human CD3, CD3 of another mammal (such as mouse CD3, rat CD3, or primate CD3), as well as different forms of CD3 (e.g., glycosylated CD3).

In some embodiments, a CD3 antibody is identified by incubating a candidate agent with CD3 and monitoring binding and/or attendant reduction of CD3 expression levels. The binding assay may be performed with purified CD3 polypeptide(s), or with cells naturally expressing, or transfected to express, CD3 polypeptide(s).

The VL CDR1 (SEQ ID NO: 26), VL CDR2 (SEQ ID NO: 27) and VL CDR3 (SEQ ID NO: 28) were grafted onto DPK9 framework and expressed in combination with the heavy chain bearing CDRs, VH CDR1 (SEQ ID NO: 13), VH CDR2 (SEQ ID NO: 16), and VH CDR3 (SEQ ID NO: 18). In addition to grafting CDRs into frame works, certain back mutations were also tested. The back mutations introduced in both heavy and light chain frameworks are shown in Table 10 with residue number at which back mutation was performed indicated.</p><p id=\"p0431\" num=\"0431\">The cDNAs containing human acceptor framework, VH3 for heavy chain and VK1 for light chain, with relevant CDR donor sequences were synthesized. Synthesized cDNA products were subcloned and fused in frame with human IgG1 constant region for the heavy chain, and human kappa for the light chain in mammalian expression vectors. To differentiate from H2B4 antibody, these variants are called 2B5 and all the optimized molecules will be referred to as 2B5 and its variants here after. All the 2B5 mutants were analyzed for competitive binding to Jurkat cells with endogenous expression of CD3e.</p><p id=\"p0432\" num=\"0432\">A competition FACS was performed to examine whether humanized 2B5 maintained its binding epitope on cell surface. Prior to the competition FACS experiment, chimeric cH2B4 was biotinylated. The EC50 of the binding of biotinylated cH2B4 to Jurkat cells was determined by direct binding using FACS and determined to be 0.8nM. For the competition FACS, 3-fold serially diluted antibody variants were mixed with a constant amount of biotin-cH2B4 representing EC50 concentration and 1.0+E05 cell/well of Jurkat cells. The mixtures were incubated for 1 hour on ice followed by 3x washing with FACS buffer. The secondary antibody, PE (phycoerythrin) conjugated streptavidin (PE-SA) was added to the cells and incubated for 30 minutes on ice. Median fluorescence intensity (MFI) was then analyzed by FACS on a FACS CANTO<sup>\u2122</sup> (BD Biosciences).
